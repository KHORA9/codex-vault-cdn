S. YOUNG, PRINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following Letters I have endeavoured to exhibit in their true\r\nlight the singular natural phenomena of which old superstition and\r\nmodern charlatanism in turn availed themselves—to indicate their laws,\r\nand to develop their theory. The subject is so important that I\r\nmight well have approached it in a severer guise. But, slight as this\r\nperformance may appear, I profess to have employed upon it the keenest\r\nand most patient efforts of reflection of which I am capable. And as\r\nto its tone at the commencement, and the prominence given to popular\r\nand trivial topics, I candidly avow that, without some such artifice, I\r\ndoubt whether I should have found a publisher of repute to publish, or\r\na circle of readers to read, my lucubrations.\r\n\r\n    “Cosi all’ egro fanciul porgiamo aspersi\r\n    Di soave licor gli orli del vaso;\r\n    Succhi amari ingannato intanto ei beve,\r\n    E dall’ inganno suo vita riceve.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the winter of 1846 that the original seven Letters were\r\nwritten, of which the present fourteen are the third and expanded\r\nreprint. The hour had come for successfully assailing certain already\r\nshaking prejudices of the reading public. The Selbstschau of Zschokke,\r\nand the researches of Von Reichenbach, were in the hands of the\r\nliterary and philosophic. The seer-gift of the former (see Letter IV.)\r\nhad established the fact that one mind can enter into direct though\r\none-sided communion with another. The undenied Od-force of the latter\r\n(see Letter I.) is evidently the same influence with that, the first\r\ncrude announcement of which, by Mesmer, had scared the world into\r\ndisbelief. It had now become possible to explain ghostly warnings,\r\nand popular prophecies, the wonders of natural trance, and of animal\r\nmagnetism, without having recourse to a single unproven principle.\r\nI therefore made the attempt; other more efficient labourers have\r\nco-operated in the same object; and public opinion is no longer hostile\r\nto this class of inquiries.\r\n\r\n  BAD WEILBACH, near MAYENCE,\r\n  _1st August, 1851_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LETTER I.

I remembered the deep awe\r\nwith which I had listened, many a year ago, to tales of seers, ghosts,\r\nvampyrs, and all the dark brood of night. And I thought it would be\r\ninfinitely agreeable to thrill again with mysterious terrors, to\r\nstart in my chair at the closing of a distant door, to raise my eyes\r\nwith uneasy apprehension towards the mirror opposite, and to feel my\r\nskin creep through the sensible “afflatus” of an invisible presence.\r\nI entered, accordingly, upon a very promising course of appalling\r\nreading. But, a-lack and well-a-day! a change had come over me since\r\nthe good old times when fancy, with fear and superstition behind her,\r\nwould creep on tiptoe to catch a shuddering glimpse of Kobbold, Fay,\r\nor incubus. Vain were all my efforts to revive the pleasant horrors of\r\nearlier years: it was as if I had planned going to a play to enjoy\r\nagain the full gusto of scenic illusion, and, through absence of mind,\r\nwas attending a morning rehearsal only; when, instead of what I had\r\nanticipated, great-coats, hats, umbrellas, and ordinary men and women,\r\nmasks, tinsel, trap-doors, pulleys, and a world of intricate machinery,\r\nlit by a partial gleam of sunshine, had met my view. The enchantment\r\nwas no longer there—the spell was broken.\r\n\r\nYet, on second thoughts, the daylight scene was worth contemplating.\r\nA new object, of stronger interest, suggested itself. I might examine\r\nand learn the mechanism of the illusions which had failed to furnish\r\nme the projected entertainment. In the books I had looked into, I\r\ndiscerned a clue to the explanation of many wonderful stories, which I\r\ncould hitherto only seriously meet by disbelief. I saw that phenomena,\r\nwhich before had appeared isolated, depended upon a common principle,\r\nitself allied with a variety of other singular facts and observations,\r\nwhich wanted only to be placed in philosophical juxtaposition to be\r\nrecognised as belonging to science. So I determined to employ the\r\nleisure before me upon an inquiry into the amount of truth in popular\r\nsuperstitions, certain that, if the attempt were not premature, the\r\nlabour would be well repaid. There must be a real foundation for\r\nthe belief of ages. There can be no prevalent delusion without a\r\ncorresponding truth. The visionary promises of alchemy foreshadowed the\r\nsolid performances of modern chemistry, as the debased worship of the\r\nEgyptians implied the existence of a proper object of worship.\r\n\r\nAmong the immortal productions of the Scottish Shakspeare—you smile,\r\nbut that phrase contains the true belief, not a popular delusion; for\r\nthe spirit of the poet lives not in the form of his works, but in his\r\ncreative power and vivid intuitions of nature; and the form even is\r\noften nearer than you think:—but this excursiveness will never do; so,\r\nto begin again.\r\n\r\nAmong the novels of Scott—I intended to say—there is not one more wins\r\nupon us than the _Antiquary_. Nowhere has the great author more gently\r\nand indulgently, never with happier humour, portrayed the mixed web of\r\nstrength and infirmity in human character; never, besides, with more\r\nfacile power evoked pathos and terror, and disported himself amid the\r\nsublimity and beauty of nature. Yet, gentle as is his mood, he misses\r\nnot the opportunity—albeit, in general, he displays an honest leaning\r\ntowards old superstitions—mercilessly to crush one of the humblest. Do\r\nyou remember the Priory of St. Ruth, and the summer-party made to visit\r\nit, and the preparations for the subsequent rogueries of Dousterswivel\r\nin the tale of Martin Waldeck, and the discovery of a spring of water\r\nby means of the divining rod?\r\n\r\nI am inclined, do you know, to dispute the verdict of the novelist on\r\nthis occasion, and to take the part of the charlatan against the author\r\nof his being; as far, at least, as regards the genuineness of the art\r\nthe said charlatan then and there affected to practise. There exists,\r\nin fact, strong evidence to show that, in competent hands, the divining\r\nrod really does what is pretended of it. This evidence I propose to put\r\nbefore you in the present letter. But, as the subject may be entirely\r\nnew to you, I had best begin by describing what is meant by a divining\r\nrod, and in what the imputed jugglery consists.\r\n\r\nThen you are to learn that, in mining districts, a superstition\r\nprevails among the people that some are born gifted with an occult\r\npower of detecting the proximity of veins of metal, and of underground\r\ncurrents of water. In Cornwall, they hold that about one in forty\r\npossesses this faculty. The mode of exercising it is very simple. They\r\ncut a hazel twig, just below where it forks. Having stripped the leaves\r\noff, they cut each branch to something more than a foot in length,\r\nleaving the stump three inches long. This implement is the divining\r\nrod. The hazel is selected for the purpose, because it branches more\r\nsymmetrically than its neighbours. The hazel-fork is to be held by\r\nthe branches, one in either hand, the stump or point projecting\r\nstraight forwards. The arms of the experimenter hang by his sides; but\r\nthe elbows being bent at a right angle, the fore-arms are advanced\r\nhorizontally; the hands are held eight to ten inches apart; the\r\nknuckles down, and the thumbs outwards. The ends of the branches of the\r\ndivining fork appear between the roots of the thumbs and fore-fingers.\r\n\r\nThe operator, thus armed, walks over the ground he intends exploring,\r\nin the full expectation that, if he possesses the mystic gift, as\r\nsoon as he passes over a vein of metal, or an underground spring, the\r\nhazel-fork will begin to move spontaneously in his hands, rising or\r\nfalling as the case may be.\r\n\r\nYou are possibly amused at my gravely stating, as a fact, an event so\r\nunlikely. It is, indeed, natural that you should suppose the whole a\r\njuggle, and think the seemingly spontaneous motion of the divining\r\nfork to be really communicated to it by the hands of the conjurer—by a\r\nsleight, in fact, which he puts in practice when he believes that he is\r\nwalking over a hidden water-course, or wishes you to believe that there\r\nis a vein of metal near. Well, I thought as you do the greater part of\r\nmy life; and probably the likeliest way of combating your skepticism,\r\nwill be to tell you how my own conversion took place.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1843 I dwelt under the same roof with a Scottish\r\ngentleman, well informed, of a serious turn of mind, fully endowed\r\nwith the national allowance of shrewdness and caution. I saw a good\r\ndeal of him; and one day, by chance, this subject of the divining rod\r\nwas mentioned. He told me, that at one time his curiosity having been\r\nraised upon the subject, he had taken pains to ascertain what there\r\nis in it. With this object in view he had obtained an introduction\r\nto Mrs. R., sister of Sir G. R., then living at Southampton, whom he\r\nhad learned to be one of those in whose hands the divining rod moved.\r\nHe visited the lady, who was polite enough to show him in what the\r\nperformance consists, and to answer all his questions, and to assist\r\nhim in making experiments calculated to test the reality of the\r\nphenomenon, and to elucidate its cause.\r\n\r\nMrs. R. told my friend that, being at Cheltenham in 1806, she saw, for\r\nthe first time, the divining rod used by Mrs. Colonel Beaumont, who\r\npossessed the power of imparting motion to it in a very remarkable\r\ndegree. Mrs. R. tried the experiment herself at that time, but without\r\nany success. She was, as it happened, very far from well. Afterwards,\r\nin the year 1815, being asked by a friend how the divining rod is held,\r\nand how it is to be used, on showing it she was surprised to see that\r\nthe instrument now moved in her hands.\r\n\r\nSince then, whenever she had repeated the experiment, the power had\r\nalways manifested itself, though with varying degrees of energy.\r\n\r\nMrs. R. then took my friend to a part of the shrubbery where she knew,\r\nfrom former trials, the divining rod would move in her hands. It did\r\nso, to my friend’s extreme astonishment; and even continued to move,\r\nwhen, availing himself of Mrs. R.’s permission, my friend grasped her\r\nhands with sufficient firmness to prevent, as he supposed, any muscular\r\naction of her wrists or fingers influencing the result.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent day my friend having thought over what he had seen,\r\nrepeated his visit to the lady. He provided himself, as substitutes for\r\nthe hazel-fork which he had seen her employ, with portions of copper\r\nand iron wire about a foot and a half long, bent something into the\r\nform of the letter V. He had made, in fact, divining forks of wire,\r\nwanting only the projecting point. He found that these instruments\r\nmoved quite as freely in Mrs. R.’s hands as the hazel-fork had done.\r\nThen he coated the two handles of one of them with sealing-wax,\r\nleaving, however, the extreme ends free and uncovered. When Mrs. R.\r\ntried the rod so prepared, holding the parts alone which were covered\r\nwith sealing-wax, and walked on the same piece of ground as in the\r\nformer experiments, the rod remained perfectly still. As often,\r\nhowever, as—with no greater change than adjusting her hands so as to\r\ntouch the free ends of the wire with her thumbs—Mrs. R. renewed direct\r\ncontact with the instrument, it again moved. The motion ceased again as\r\noften as the direct contact was interrupted.\r\n\r\nThis simple narrative, made to me by the late Mr. George Fairholm,\r\ncarried conviction to my mind of the reality of the phenomenon. I asked\r\nmy friend why he had not pursued the subject further. He said he had\r\noften thought of doing so, and had, he believed, mainly been deterred\r\nby meeting with the work of the Compte de Tristan, entitled _Recherches\r\nsur quelques effluves terrestres_, Paris, 1829, in which facts similar\r\nto those which he had himself verified were given, and a number of\r\nadditional curious experiments detailed.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Fairholm’s instance I procured the book, and, at a later period,\r\nread it. I may say that it both satisfied and disappointed me. It\r\nsatisfied me, inasmuch as it fully confirmed all that Mr. Fairholm\r\nhad stated. It disappointed me, for it threw no additional light upon\r\nthe phenomena. M. de Tristan had in fact brought too little physical\r\nknowledge to the investigation, so that a large proportion of his\r\nexperiments are puerile. However, his simpler experiments are valuable\r\nand suggestive. These I will presently describe. In the mean time,\r\nyou shall hear the Count’s own narrative of his initiation into the\r\nmysteries of the divining rod.\r\n\r\n“The history of my researches,” says M. de Tristan, “is simply\r\nthis. Some twenty years ago, a gentleman who, from his position in\r\nsociety, could have no object to gain by deception, showed to me, for\r\nmy amusement, the movement of the divining rod. He attributed the\r\nmotion to the influence of a current of water, which appeared to me\r\na probable supposition. But my attention was more engaged with the\r\naction produced by the influence, let the latter be what it might.\r\nMy informant assured me he had met with many others in whom the same\r\neffects were manifested. When I returned home, and had opportunities\r\nof making trials under favourable circumstances, I found that I myself\r\npossessed the same endowment. Since then I have induced many to make\r\nthe experiment, and I have found a fourth, or certainly a fifth, of\r\nthe number capable of setting the divining rod in motion at the very\r\nfirst attempt. Since that time, during these twenty years, I have often\r\ntried my hand, but for amusement only, and desultorily, and without\r\nany idea of making the thing an object of scientific investigation.\r\nBut at length, in the year 1822, being in the country, and removed\r\nfrom my ordinary pursuits, the subject again came across me, and I\r\ndetermined forthwith to try and ascertain the cause of this phenomena.\r\nAccordingly, I commenced a long series of experiments, from fifteen to\r\neighteen hundred in number, which occupied me nearly fifteen months.\r\nThe results of above twelve hundred were written down at the time of\r\ntheir performance.”\r\n\r\nThe scene of the Count’s operations was in the valley of the Loire,\r\nfive leagues from Vendôme, in the park of the Chateau de Ranac. The\r\nsurface of ground which gave the desired results was from seventy to\r\neighty feet in breadth. But there was another spot equally efficient at\r\nthe Count’s ordinary residence at Emerillon, near Clery, four leagues\r\nsouth of Orleans, ten leagues south of the Loire, at the commencement\r\nof the plains of Solonge. The surface ran from north to south, and\r\nhad the same breadth with the other. These “exciting tracts” form, in\r\ngeneral, bands or zones of undetermined, and often very great length.\r\nTheir breadth is very variable; some are only three or four feet\r\nacross, while others are one hundred paces. These tracts are sometimes\r\nsinuous; in other instances they ramify. To the most susceptible they\r\nare broader than to those who are less so.\r\n\r\nM. de Tristan thus describes what happens when a competent person,\r\narmed with a hazel-fork, walks over the exciting districts:—\r\n\r\nWhen two or three steps have been made upon the exciting tract of\r\nground, the fork, which at starting is held horizontally, with the\r\npoint forwards, begins gently to ascend; it gradually attains a\r\nvertical position; sometimes it passes beyond that, and lowering\r\nitself, with its point to the chest of the operator, it becomes again\r\nhorizontal. If the motion continues, the rod descending becomes\r\nvertical, with the point downwards. Finally, the rod may again ascend\r\nand resume its first position. When the action is very lively, the rod\r\nimmediately commences a second revolution; and so it goes on, as long\r\nas the operator continues to walk over the exciting surface of ground.\r\n\r\nA few of those in whose hands the divining fork moves exhibit a\r\nremarkable peculiarity. The instrument, instead of commencing its\r\nmotion by ascending, descends; the point then becomes directed\r\nvertically downwards; afterwards it reascends, and completes a\r\nrevolution in a course the opposite of the usual one; and as often and\r\nas long as its motion is excited, it pursues this abnormal course.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous experiments made by M. de Tristan, the following are\r\namong the simplest and the best:—\r\n\r\nHe covered both handles of a divining rod with a thick silk stuff.\r\nThe result of using the instrument so prepared was the same which Mr.\r\nFairholm obtained by coating the handles with sealing-wax. The motion\r\nof the divining rod was extinguished.\r\n\r\nHe covered both handles with one layer of a thin silk. He then found\r\nthat the motion of the divining rod took place, but it was less lively\r\nand vigorous than ordinary.\r\n\r\nBy covering one handle of the divining rod, and that the right, with\r\na layer of thin silk, a very singular and instructive result was\r\nobtained. The motion of the instrument was now reversed. It commenced\r\nby descending.\r\n\r\nAfter covering the point of the divining rod with a thick layer of silk\r\nstuff, the motion was sensibly more brisk than it had been before.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count held in his hands a straight rod of the same substance\r\nconjointly with the ordinary divining rod, no movement of the latter\r\nwhatsoever ensued.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Count discovered that he could cause the divining rod to\r\nmove when he walked over a non-exciting surface—as, for instance, in\r\nhis own chamber—by various processes. Of these the most interesting\r\nconsisted in touching the point of the instrument with either pole of\r\na magnetic needle. The instrument shortly began to move, ascending or\r\ndescending, according as the northward or southward pole of the needle\r\nhad been applied to it.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to add that these, and all M. de Tristan’s\r\nexperiments, were repeated by him many times. The results of those\r\nwhich I have narrated were constant.\r\n\r\nLet me now attempt to realize something out of the preceding statements.\r\n\r\n1. It is shown, by the testimony adduced, that whereas in the hands\r\nof most persons the divining rod remains motionless, in the hands of\r\nsome it moves promptly and briskly when the requisite conditions are\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n2. It is no less certain that the motion of the divining rod has\r\nappeared, to various intelligent and honest persons, who have succeeded\r\nin producing it, to be entirely spontaneous; or that the said persons\r\nwere not conscious of having excited or promoted the motion by the\r\nslightest help of their own.\r\n\r\n3. It appears that in the ordinary use of the divining rod by competent\r\npersons, its motion only manifests itself in certain localities.\r\n\r\n4. It being assumed that the operator does not, however unconsciously,\r\nby the muscular action of his hands and wrists produce the motion of\r\nthe divining rod, the likeliest way of accounting for the phenomenon is\r\nto suppose that the divining rod may become the conductor of some fluid\r\nor force, emanating from or disturbed in the body by a terrestrial\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nBut here a difficulty arises: How can it happen that the hypothetical\r\nforce makes so long and round-about a course? Why, communicated to the\r\nbody through the legs, does not the supposed fluid complete a circuit\r\nat once in the lower part of the trunk?\r\n\r\nSuch, at all events, would be the course an electric current so\r\ncircumstanced would take.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty raised admits of being removed by aid derived from\r\na novel and unexpected source. I allude to the discovery, by Von\r\nReichenbach, of a new force or principle in the physical world, which,\r\nwhether or not it is identical with that which gives motion to the\r\ndivining rod, exhibits, at all events, the very property which the\r\nhypothetical principle should possess to explain the phenomena which we\r\nhave been considering.\r\n\r\nNo attempts have indeed been made to identify the two as one; and my\r\nconjecture that they may prove so, should it even appear plausible,\r\nis so vague, that I should have contented myself with referring to\r\nVon Reichenbach’s new principle as to an established truth, and have\r\nintroduced no account of it into this Letter, had I not a second\r\nmotive for insuring your cognisance of the curious facts which the\r\nViennese philosopher has brought to light. It is less with the view\r\nof furnishing a leg to the theory of the divining rod, than in order\r\nto provide the means of elucidating more interesting problems, that\r\nI now proceed briefly to sketch the leading experiments made by Von\r\nReichenbach, and their results.\r\n\r\nObjections have been taken against these experiments, on the ground\r\nthat their effects are purely subjective; that the results must be\r\nreceived on the testimony of the party employed; and that the best\r\nparties for the purpose are persons whose natural sensibility is\r\nexalted by disorder of the nerves; a class of persons always suspected\r\nof exaggeration, and even, and in part with justice, of a tendency to\r\ntrickery and deception. But this was well known to Von Reichenbach,\r\nwho appears to have taken every precaution necessary to secure his\r\nobservations against error. And when I add, that many of the results\r\nwhich he obtained upon the most sensitive and the highly nervous, were\r\nlikewise manifested in persons of established character and in good\r\nhealth, and that the fidelity of the author and of his researches is\r\nauthenticated by the publication of the latter in Woehler and Liebig’s\r\n_Chemical Annals_, (Supplement to volume 53, Heidelberg, 1845,) I think\r\nyou will not withhold from them complete reliance.\r\n\r\nIn general, persons in health and of a strong constitution are\r\ninsensible to the influence of Von Reichenbach’s new force. But all\r\npersons, the tone of whose health has been lowered by their mode of\r\nlife—men of sedentary habits, clerks, and the like, and women who\r\nemploy their whole time in needlework, whose pale complexions show the\r\nrelaxed and therefore irritable state of their frames—all such, or\r\nnearly all—evince more or less susceptibility to the influence I am\r\nabout to describe.\r\n\r\nVon Reichenbach found that persons of the latter class, when slow\r\npasses are made with the poles of a strong magnet moved parallel to\r\nthe surface—down the back, for instance, or down the limbs, and only\r\ndistant enough just not to touch the clothes—feel sensations rather\r\nunpleasant than otherwise, as of a light draft of air blown upon them\r\nin the path of the magnet.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of his researches, Von Reichenbach found that the more\r\nsensitive among his subjects could detect the presence of his new agent\r\nby another sense. In the dark they saw dim flames of light issuing and\r\nwaving from the poles of the magnet. The experiments suggested by this\r\ndiscovery afford the most satisfactory proofs of the reality of the\r\nphenomena. They were the following:—A horse-shoe magnet having been\r\nadjusted upon a table, with the poles directed upwards, the sensitive\r\nsubject saw, at the distance of ten feet, the appearance of flames\r\nissuing from it. The armature of the magnet—a bar of soft iron—was then\r\napplied. Upon this the flames disappeared. They reappeared, she said,\r\nas often as the armature was removed from the magnet.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment was made with a yet more sensitive subject. This\r\nperson saw, in the first instance, flames as the first had done;\r\nbut when the armature of the magnet was applied, the flames did not\r\ndisappear: she saw flames still: only they were fainter, and their\r\ndisposition was different. They seemed now to issue from every part of\r\nthe surface of the magnet equally.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add, that these experiments were made in a\r\nwell-darkened room, and that none of the bystanders could discern what\r\nthe sensitive subjects saw.\r\n\r\nThen the following experiment was made:—A powerful lens was so placed\r\nas that it should concentrate the light of the flames (if real light\r\nthey were) upon a point of the wall of the room. The patient at\r\nonce saw the light upon the wall at the right place; and when the\r\ninclination of the lens was shifted, so as to throw the focus in\r\nsuccession on different points, the sensitive observer never failed in\r\npointing out the right spot.\r\n\r\nTo his new force, which Von Reichenbach had now found to emanate\r\nlikewise from the poles of crystals and the wires of the voltaic pile,\r\nhe gave the arbitrary but convenient name of Od, or the Od force.\r\n\r\nHis next step was to ascertain the existence of a difference among the\r\nsensations produced by Od. Sometimes the current of air was described\r\nas warm, sometimes as cool. He found this difference to depend upon\r\nthe following cause: Whenever the northward pole of a magnet, or one\r\ndefinite pole of a large crystal, or the negative wire of a voltaic\r\nbattery, is employed in the experiment, the sensation produced is that\r\nof a draft of cool air. On the contrary, the southward pole of the\r\nmagnet, the opposite pole of the crystal, the positive voltaic wire,\r\nexcite the sensation of a draft of warm air.\r\n\r\nSo the new force appeared to be a polar force, and Von Reichenbach\r\ncalled the first series of the above described manifestations\r\n_Od-negative_ effects, the second _Od-positive_ effects.\r\n\r\nFrom among his numerous experiments towards establishing the polarity\r\nof Od, I select the following:—One of the most sensitive of his\r\nsubjects held, at his desire, a piece of copper wire, by the middle\r\nwith the right hand—by one end with the left. Then Von Reichenbach\r\ntouched the free end of the wire with one pole of a large crystal, in\r\norder to charge it with Od. The patient immediately felt a sensation in\r\nthe right hand, which disappeared as quickly, to be felt by the left\r\nhand instead, at the further end of the piece of wire. She then was\r\nbidden to take hold of the wire with both her hands at the middle,\r\nand then to slide them away from each other to the opposite ends:\r\nshe observed, on doing so, that sensations were produced which were\r\nstrong and decided when her hands held the two ends of the wire, and\r\ndiminished in intensity in proportion as the hands were nearer its\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\nVon Reichenbach next came upon the observation that the human hand\r\ngives out the Od force; and that the right hand displays the characters\r\nof negative Od, the left those of positive Od. The more sensitive\r\nsubjects recognised, in the dark, the appearance of dim flames\r\nproceeding from the tips of his fingers; and all felt the corresponding\r\nsensations of drafts of cool or of warm air. Subsequently the whole\r\nbody was found to share the properties of the hands; the entire right\r\nside to manifest negative Od, the entire left side positive Od.\r\n\r\nSo, in reference to this new force, the human body exhibits a\r\ntransverse polarity; the condition is thus realized which is required\r\nto belong to the hypothetical force through which the divining rod\r\nmight be supposed to move. If any terrestrial influence were capable\r\nof disturbing the Od force in the body, however it might affect its\r\nintensity, a current or circuit could only be established through the\r\narms and hands; unless, indeed, some extraordinary means were taken,\r\nsuch as employing an artificial conductor, arched half round the body,\r\nto connect the two sides.\r\n\r\nThe sensations which attend the establishment of a current of Od and\r\ninterferences with it, in sensitive subjects, are exemplified in the\r\nfollowing observations:—\r\n\r\nA bar magnet was laid on the palm of the left hand of one of the most\r\nsensitive subjects, with its southward pole resting on the end of her\r\nmiddle finger, the northward pole on the fore-arm above the wrist. It\r\nthus corresponded with the natural polar arrangement of the Od force in\r\nthe patient’s hand and arm. Accordingly, no sensation was excited. But\r\nwhen the position of the magnet was reversed, and the northward pole\r\nlay on the end of the middle finger of the left hand, an uneasy sense\r\nof an inward conflict arose in the hand and wrist, which disappeared\r\nwhen the magnet was removed or its original direction restored. On\r\nlaying the magnet reversed on the fore-arm, the sense of an inward\r\nstruggle returned, which was heightened on joining the hands and\r\nestablishing a circuit.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient completed the circuit in another way—namely, by\r\nholding a bar magnet by the ends, if the latter were disposed normally,\r\n(that is, if the northward pole was held in the left hand, the\r\nsouthward pole in the right,) a lively consciousness of some inward\r\naction ensued. A normal circulation of Od was in progress. When the\r\ndirection of the magnet was reversed, the phenomenon mentioned in the\r\nlast paragraph recurred. The patient experienced a high degree of\r\nuneasiness, a feeling as of an inward struggle extending itself to the\r\nchest, with a sense of whirling round, and confusion in the head. These\r\nsymptoms disappeared immediately upon her letting go the magnet.\r\n\r\nSimilar results ensued when Von Reichenbach substituted himself for the\r\nmagnet. When he took Miss Maix’s hands in his normally—that is to say,\r\nher left in his right, her right in his left—she felt a circulation\r\nmoving up the right arm through the chest down the left arm, attended\r\nwith a sense of giddiness. When he changed hands, the disagreeableness\r\nof the sensation was suddenly heightened, the sense of inward conflict\r\narose, attended with a sort of undulation up and down the arms, and\r\nthrough the chest, which quickly became intolerable.\r\n\r\nA singular but consistent difference in the result ensued when Von\r\nReichenbach repeated the last two experiments upon Herr Schuh. Herr\r\nSchuh was a strong man, thirty years of age, in full health, but\r\nhighly impressible by Od. When Von Reichenbach took his two hands in\r\nhis own normally, Herr Schuh felt the normal establishment of the Od\r\ncurrent in his arms and chest. In a few seconds headache and vertigo\r\nensued, and the experiment was too disagreeable to be prolonged. But\r\nwhen Von Reichenbach took his hands abnormally, no sensible effect\r\nensued. Being equally strong with Von Reichenbach, Herr Schuh’s frame\r\nrepelled the counter-current, which the latter arrangement tended to\r\nthrow into him. In the first or normal arrangement, the Od current had\r\nmet with no resistance, but had simply gone its natural course. The\r\ndistress occurred _from its being felt_ through Herr Schuh’s accidental\r\nsensitiveness to Od; of the freaks of which in their systems people in\r\ngeneral are unconscious.\r\n\r\nI have concluded my case in favour of the pretensions of the divining\r\nrod. It seems to me, at all events, strong enough to justify any one\r\nwho has leisure, in cutting a hazel-fork, and walking about with it in\r\nsuitable places, holding it in the manner described. I doubt, however,\r\nwhether I should recommend a friend to make the experiment. If, by good\r\nluck, the divining rod should refuse to move in his hands, he might\r\naccuse himself of credulity, and feel silly, and hope nobody had seen\r\nhim, for the rest of the day. If, unfortunately, the first trial should\r\nsucceed, and he should be led to pursue the inquiry, the consequences\r\nwould be more serious: his probable fate would be to fall at once\r\nseveral degrees in the estimation of his friends, and to pass with\r\nthe world, all the rest of his life, for a crotchety person of weak\r\nintellects.\r\n\r\nAs for the divining rod itself, if my argument prove sound, it will be\r\na credit to the family of superstitions; for without any reduction,\r\nor clipping, or trimming, it may at once assume the rank of a new\r\ntruth. But, alas! the trials which await it in that character!—what an\r\nordeal is before it! A new truth has to encounter three normal stages\r\nof opposition. In the first, it is denounced as an imposture; in the\r\nsecond—that is, when it is beginning to force itself into notice—it\r\nis cursorily examined, and plausibly explained away; in the third, or\r\n_cui bono_ stage, it is decried as useless, and hostile to religion.\r\nAnd when it is fully admitted, it passes only under a protest that it\r\nhas been perfectly known for ages—a proceeding intended to make the new\r\ntruth ashamed of itself, and wish it had never been born.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the sea-serpent on having arrived at the second stage of\r\nbelief. Since Professor Owen (no disrespect to his genuine ability and\r\neminent knowledge) has explained it into a sea-elephant, its chance of\r\nbeing itself is much improved; and as it will skip the third stage—for\r\nwho will venture to question the good of a sea-serpent?—it is liable\r\nnow any morning “to wake and find itself famous,” and to be received\r\neven at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where its remains may commemoratively be\r\nticketed the Ex-Great-Seal.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT, (1850.)—It may save trouble to some future experimenter to\r\nnarrate my own exploits with the divining rod.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1847, being then at Weilbach in Nassau, a region\r\nteeming with underground sources of water, I requested the son of\r\nthe proprietor of the bathing establishment—a tall, thin, pale,\r\nwhite-haired youth, by name Edward Seebold—to walk in my presence up\r\nand down a promising spot of ground, holding a divining fork of hazel,\r\nwith the accessories recommended by M. de Tristan to beginners—that is\r\nto say, he held in his right hand three pieces of silver, besides one\r\nhandle of the rod, while the handle which he held in his left hand was\r\ncovered with a thin silk.\r\n\r\nThe lad had not made five steps when the point of the divining fork\r\nbegan to ascend. He laughed with astonishment at the event, which was\r\ntotally unexpected by him; and he said that he experienced a tickling\r\nor thrilling sensation in his hands. He continued to walk up and down\r\nbefore me. The fork had soon described a complete circle; then it\r\ndescribed another; and so it continued to do as long as he walked thus,\r\nand as often as, after stopping, he resumed his walk. The experiment\r\nwas repeated by him in my presence, with like success, several times\r\nduring the ensuing month. Then the lad fell into ill health, and I\r\nrarely saw him. However, one day I sent for him, and begged him to do\r\nme the favour of making another trial with the divining fork. He did\r\nso, but the instrument moved slowly and sluggishly; and when, having\r\ncompleted a semicircle, it pointed backwards towards the pit of his\r\nstomach, it stopped, and would go no farther. At the same time the lad\r\nsaid he felt an uneasy sensation, which quickly increased to pain,\r\nat the pit of the stomach, and he became alarmed, when I bade him\r\nquit hold of one handle of the divining rod, and the pain ceased. Ten\r\nminutes afterwards I induced him to make another trial; the results\r\nwere the same. A few days later, when the lad seemed still more out\r\nof health, I induced him to repeat the experiment. Now, however, the\r\ndivining fork would not move at all.\r\n\r\nI entertain little doubt that the above performances of Edward Seebold\r\nwere genuine. I thought the same of the performances of three English\r\ngentlemen, and of a German, in whose hands, however, the divining rod\r\nnever moved through an entire circle. In the hands of one of them\r\nits motion was retrograde, or abnormal: that is to say, it began by\r\ndescending.\r\n\r\nBut I met with other cases, which were less satisfactory, though not\r\nuninstructive. I should observe that, in the hands of several who\r\ntried to use it in my presence, the divining fork would not move an\r\ninch. But there were two younger brothers of Edward Seebold, and a\r\nbath-maid, and my own man, in whose hands the rod played new pranks.\r\nWhen these parties walked _forwards_ the instrument ascended, or\r\nmoved normally; but when, by my desire, they walked _backwards_, the\r\ninstrument immediately went the other way. I should observe that, in\r\nthe hands of Edward Seebold, the instrument moved in the same direction\r\nwhether he walked forwards or backwards; and I have mentioned that at\r\nfirst it described in his hands a complete circle. But with the four\r\nparties I have just been speaking of, the motion of the fork was always\r\nlimited in extent. When it moved normally at starting, it stopped\r\nafter describing an arc of about 225°; in the same way, when it moved\r\nabnormally at starting, it would stop after describing an arc of about\r\n135°; that is to say, there was one spot the same for the two cases,\r\nbeyond which it could not get. Then I found that, in the hands of my\r\nman, the divining rod would move even when he was standing still,\r\nalthough with a less lively action; still it stopped as before, nearly\r\nat the same point. Sometimes it ascended, sometimes descended. Then\r\nI tried some experiments, touching the point with a magnetic needle.\r\nI found, in the course of them, that when my man knew which way I\r\nexpected the fork to move, it invariably answered my expectations;\r\nbut when I had the man blindfolded, the results were uncertain and\r\ncontradictory. The end of all this was, that I became certain that\r\nseveral of those in whose hands the divining rod moves, set it in\r\nmotion and direct its motion by the pressure of their fingers, and by\r\ncarrying their hands nearer to, or farther apart. In walking forwards,\r\nthe hands are unconsciously borne towards each other; in walking\r\nbackwards, the reverse is the case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I recommend no one to prosecute these experiments unless\r\nhe can execute them himself, and unless the divining rod describes a\r\ncomplete circle in his hands; and even then he should be on his guard\r\nagainst self-deception.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT II.—I am now (May, 1851) again residing at the bathing\r\nestablishment of Weilbach, near Mayence; and it was with some interest\r\nand curiosity that the other day I requested Mr. Edward Seebold, now a\r\nwell-grown young man, in full health, to try his hand again with the\r\ndivining-rod. He readily assented to my request; and he this time knew\r\nexactly what result I expected. But the experiment entirely failed.\r\nThe point of the divining rod rose, as he walked, not more than two\r\nor three inches; but this it does with every one who presses the two\r\nhandles towards each other during the experiment. Afterwards the\r\nimplement remained perfectly stationary. I think I am not at liberty\r\nto withhold this result from the reader, whom it may lead to question,\r\nthough it cannot induce myself to doubt, the genuineness of the former\r\nperformances of Mr. E. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n VAMPYRISM.—Tale exemplifying the superstition—The Vampyr state of\r\n the body in the grave—Various instances of death-trance—The risk of\r\n premature interment considered—The Vampyr visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging my former letter, you express an eager desire to\r\nlearn, as you phrase it, “all about Vampyrs, if there ever were such\r\nthings.” I will not delay satisfying your curiosity, although by so\r\ndoing I interrupt the logical order of my communications. It is,\r\nperhaps, all the better. The proper place of this subject falls in the\r\nmidst of a philosophical disquisition; and it would have been a pity\r\nnot to present it to you in its pristine colouring. But how came your\r\nlate tutor, Mr. H., to leave you in ignorance upon a point on which, in\r\nmy time, schoolboys much your juniors entertained decided opinions?\r\n\r\nWere there ever such things as Vampyrs? _Tantamne rem tam negligenter!_\r\nI turn to the learned pages of Horst for a luminous and precise\r\ndefinition of the destructive and mysterious beings whose existence you\r\nhave ventured to consider problematical.\r\n\r\n“A Vampyr is a dead body which continues to live in the grave; which\r\nit leaves, however, by night, for the purpose of sucking the blood of\r\nthe living, whereby it is nourished and preserved in good condition,\r\ninstead of being decomposed like other dead bodies.”\r\n\r\nUpon my word, you really deserve, since Mr. George Combe has clearly\r\nshown, in his admirable work on the Constitution of Man, and its\r\nadaptation to the surrounding world, that ignorance is a statutable\r\ncrime before nature, and punished by the laws of Providence—you\r\ndeserve, I say, unless you contrive to make Mr. H. your substitute,\r\nwhich I think would be just, yourself to be the subject of the\r\nnocturnal visit of a Vampyr. Your skepticism will abate pretty\r\nconsiderably when you see him stealthily entering your room, yet are\r\npowerless under the fascination of his fixed and leaden eye—when you\r\nare conscious, as you lie motionless with terror, of his nearer and\r\nnearer approach—when you feel his face, fresh with the smell of the\r\ngrave, bent over your throat, while his keen teeth make a fine incision\r\nin your jugular, preparatory to his commencing his plain but nutritive\r\nrepast.\r\n\r\nYou would look a little paler the next morning, but that would be all\r\nfor the moment; for Fischer informs us that the bite of a Vampyr leaves\r\nin general no mark upon the person. But he fearfully adds, “it (the\r\nbite) is nevertheless speedily fatal,” unless the bitten person protect\r\nhimself by eating some of the earth from the grave of the Vampyr, and\r\nsmearing himself with his blood. Unfortunately, indeed, these measures\r\nare seldom, if ever, of more than temporary use. Fischer adds, “if\r\nthrough these precautions the life of the victim be prolonged for a\r\nperiod, sooner or later he ends with becoming a Vampyr himself; that is\r\nto say, he dies and is buried, but continues to lead a Vampyr life in\r\nthe grave, nourishing himself by infecting others, and promiscuously\r\npropagating Vampyrism.”\r\n\r\nThis is no romancer’s dream. It is a succinct account of a superstition\r\nwhich to this day services in the east of Europe, where little more\r\nthan a century ago it was frightfully prevalent. At that period\r\nVampyrism spread like a pestilence through Servia and Wallachia,\r\ncausing numerous deaths, and disturbing all the land with fear of the\r\nmysterious visitation, against which no one felt himself secure.\r\n\r\nHere is something like a good, solid, practical popular delusion. Do\r\nI believe it? To be sure I do. The facts are matter of history: the\r\npeople died like rotted sheep; and the cause and method of their dying\r\nwas, in their belief, what has just been stated. You suppose, then,\r\nthey died frightened out of their lives, as men have died whose pardon\r\nhas been proclaimed when their necks were already on the block, of the\r\nbelief that they were going to die? Well, if that were all, the subject\r\nwould still be worth examining. But there is more in it than that, as\r\nthe following o’er true tale will convince you, the essential points of\r\nwhich are authenticated by documentary evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1727, there returned from the Levant to the village\r\nof Meduegna, near Belgrade, one Arnod Paole, who, in a few years of\r\nmilitary service and varied adventure, had amassed enough to purchase\r\na cottage and an acre or two of land in his native place, where he\r\ngave out that he meant to pass the remainder of his days. He kept\r\nhis word. Arnod had yet scarcely reached the prime of manhood; and\r\nthough he must have encountered the rough as well as the smooth of\r\nlife, and have mingled with many a wild and reckless companion, yet\r\nhis naturally good disposition and honest principles had preserved him\r\nunscathed in the scenes he had passed through. At all events, such\r\nwere the thoughts expressed by his neighbours as they discussed his\r\nreturn and settlement among them in the Stube of the village Hof. Nor\r\ndid the frank and open countenance of Arnod, his obliging habits and\r\nsteady conduct, argue their judgment incorrect. Nevertheless, there was\r\nsomething occasionally noticeable in his ways—a look and tone that\r\nbetrayed inward disquiet. Often would he refuse to join his friends,\r\nor on some sudden plea abruptly quit their society. And he still more\r\nunaccountably, and as it seemed systematically, avoided meeting his\r\npretty neighbour Nina, whose father occupied the next tenement to\r\nhis own. At the age of seventeen, Nina was as charming a picture of\r\nyouth, cheerfulness, innocence, and confidence, as you could have\r\nseen in all the world. You could not look into her limpid eyes, which\r\nsteadily returned your gaze, without seeing to the bottom of the pure\r\nand transparent spring of her thoughts. Why, then, did Arnod shrink\r\nfrom meeting her? He was young; had a little property; had health and\r\nindustry; and he had told his friends he had formed no ties in other\r\nlands. Why, then, did he avoid the fascination of the pretty Nina, who\r\nseemed a being made to chase from any brow the clouds of gathering\r\ncare? But he did so; yet less and less resolutely, for he felt the\r\ncharm of her presence. Who could have done otherwise? And how could he\r\nlong resist—he didn’t—the impulse of his fondness for the innocent girl\r\nwho often sought to cheer his fits of depression?\r\n\r\nAnd they were to be united—were betrothed; yet still an anxious gloom\r\nwould fitfully overcast his countenance, even in the sunshine of those\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n“What is it, dear Arnod, that makes you sad? It cannot be on my\r\naccount, I know, for you were sad before you ever noticed me; and\r\nthat, I think,” (and you should have seen the deepening rose upon her\r\ncheeks,) “surely first made me notice you.”\r\n\r\n“Nina,” he answered, “I have done, I fear, a great wrong in trying to\r\ngain your affections. Nina, I have a fixed impression that I shall not\r\nlive; yet, knowing this, I have selfishly made my existence necessary\r\nto your happiness.”\r\n\r\n“How strangely you talk, dear Arnod! Who in the village is stronger and\r\nhealthier than you? You feared no danger when you were a soldier. What\r\ndanger do you fear as a villager of Meduegna?”\r\n\r\n“It haunts me, Nina.”\r\n\r\n“But, Arnod, you were sad before you thought of me. Did you then fear\r\nto die?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Nina, it is something worse than death.” And his vigorous frame\r\nshook with agony.\r\n\r\n“Arnod, I conjure you, tell me.”\r\n\r\n“It was in Cossova this fate befell me. Here you have hitherto escaped\r\nthe terrible scourge. But there they died, and the dead visited the\r\nliving. I experienced the first frightful visitation, and I fled; but\r\nnot till I had sought his grave, and exacted the dread expiation from\r\nthe Vampyr.”\r\n\r\nNina’s blood ran cold. She stood horror-stricken. But her young heart\r\nsoon mastered her first despair. With a touching voice she spoke—\r\n\r\n“Fear not, dear Arnod; fear not now. I will be your shield, or I will\r\ndie with you!”\r\n\r\nAnd she encircled his neck with her gentle arms, and returning hope\r\nshone, Iris-like, amid her falling tears. Afterwards they found a\r\nreasonable ground for banishing or allaying their apprehension in the\r\nlength of time which had elapsed since Arnod left Cossova, during which\r\nno fearful visitant had again approached him; and they fondly trusted\r\n_that_ gave them security.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange world. The ills we fear are commonly not those which\r\noverwhelm us. The blows that reach us are for the most part unforeseen.\r\nOne day, about a week after this conversation, Arnod missed his footing\r\nwhen on the top of a loaded hay-wagon, and fell from it to the ground.\r\nHe was picked up insensible, and carried home, where, after lingering a\r\nshort time, he died. His interment, as usual, followed immediately. His\r\nfate was sad and premature. But what pencil could paint Nina’s grief!\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty days after his decease, says the perfectly\r\nauthenticated report of these transactions, several of the\r\nneighbourhood complained that they were haunted by the deceased Arnod;\r\nand, what was more to the purpose, four of them died. The evil, looked\r\nat skeptically, was bad enough, but aggravated by the suggestions of\r\nsuperstition, it spread a panic through the whole district. To allay\r\nthe popular terror, and if possible to get at the root of the evil, a\r\ndetermination was come to publicly to disinter the body of Arnod, with\r\nthe view of ascertaining whether he really was a Vampyr, and, in that\r\nevent, of treating him conformably. The day fixed for this proceeding\r\nwas the fortieth after his burial.\r\n\r\nIt was on a gray morning in early August that the commission visited\r\nthe quiet cemetery of Meduegna, which, surrounded with a wall of unhewn\r\nstone, lies sheltered by the mountain that, rising in undulating green\r\nslopes, irregularly planted with fruit trees, ends in an abrupt craggy\r\nridge, feathered with underwood. The graves were, for the most part,\r\nneatly kept, with borders of box, or something like it, and flowers\r\nbetween; and at the head of most a small wooden cross, painted black,\r\nbearing the name of the tenant. Here and there a stone had been\r\nraised. One of considerable height, a single narrow slab, ornamented\r\nwith grotesque Gothic carvings, dominated over the rest. Near this\r\nlay the grave of Arnod Paole, towards which the party moved. The work\r\nof throwing out the earth was begun by the gray, crooked old sexton,\r\nwho lived in the Leichenhaus, beyond the great crucifix. He seemed\r\nunconcerned enough; no Vampyr would think of extracting a supper out of\r\nhim. Nearest the grave stood two military surgeons, or feldscherers,\r\nfrom Belgrade, and a drummer-boy, who held their case of instruments.\r\nThe boy looked on with keen interest; and when the coffin was exposed\r\nand rather roughly drawn out of the grave, his pale face and bright\r\nintent eye showed how the scene moved him. The sexton lifted the lid of\r\nthe coffin: the body had become inclined to one side. Then turning it\r\nstraight, “Ha! ha!” said he, pointing to fresh blood upon the lips—“Ha!\r\nha! What! Your mouth not wiped since last night’s work?” The spectators\r\nshuddered; the drummer-boy sank forward, fainting, and upset the\r\ninstrument-case, scattering its contents; the senior surgeon, infected\r\nwith the horror of the scene, repressed a hasty exclamation, and simply\r\ncrossed himself. They threw water on the drummer-boy, and he recovered,\r\nbut would not leave the spot. Then they inspected the body of Arnod. It\r\nlooked as if it had not been dead a day. On handling it, the scarf-skin\r\ncame off, but below were _new skin and new nails_! How could _they_\r\nhave come there but from its foul feeding! The case was clear enough;\r\nthere lay before them the thing they dreaded—the Vampyr. So, without\r\nmore ado, they simply drove a stake through poor Arnod’s chest,\r\nwhereupon a quantity of blood gushed forth, and the corpse uttered an\r\naudible groan. “Murder! oh, murder!” shrieked the drummer-boy, as he\r\nrushed wildly, with convulsed gestures, from the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe drummer-boy was not far from the mark. But, quitting the romancing\r\nvein, which had led me to try and restore the original colours of the\r\npicture, let me confine myself, in describing the rest of the scene and\r\nwhat followed, to the words of my authority.\r\n\r\nThe body of Arnod was then burnt to ashes, which were returned to the\r\ngrave. The authorities further staked and burnt the bodies of the four\r\nothers which were supposed to have been infected by Arnod. No mention\r\nis made of the state in which they were found. The adoption of these\r\ndecisive measures failed, however, entirely to extinguish the evil,\r\nwhich continued still to hang about the village. About five years\r\nafterwards it had again become very rife, and many died through it;\r\nwhereupon the authorities determined to make another and a complete\r\nclearance of the Vampyrs in the cemetery, and with that object they had\r\nall the graves, to which present suspicion attached, opened, and their\r\ncontents officially anatomized, of which procedure the following is the\r\nmedical report, here and there _abridged_ only:—\r\n\r\n1. A woman of the name of Stana, twenty years of age, who had died\r\nthree months before of a three days’ illness following her confinement.\r\nShe had before her death avowed that she had _anointed_ herself with\r\nthe blood of a Vampyr, to liberate herself from his persecution.\r\nNevertheless, she, as well as her infant, whose body through careless\r\ninterment had been half eaten by the dogs, had died. Her body was\r\nentirely free from decomposition. On opening it, the chest was found\r\nfull of recently effused blood, and the bowels had exactly the\r\nappearances of sound health. The skin and nails of her hands and feet\r\nwere loose and came off, but underneath lay new skin and nails.\r\n\r\n2. A woman of the name of Miliza, who had died at the end of a three\r\nmonths’ illness. The body had been buried ninety and odd days. In the\r\nchest was liquid blood. The viscera were as in the former instance.\r\nThe body was declared by a heyduk, who recognised it, to be in better\r\ncondition, and fatter, than it had been in the woman’s legitimate\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\n3. The body of a child eight years old, that had likewise been buried\r\nninety days: it was in the Vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n4. The son of a heyduk named Milloc, sixteen years old. The body\r\nhad lain in the grave nine weeks. He had died after three days’\r\nindisposition, and was in the condition of a Vampyr.\r\n\r\n5. Joachim, likewise son of a heyduk, seventeen years old. He had died\r\nafter three days’ illness; had been buried eight weeks and some days;\r\nwas found in the Vampyr state.\r\n\r\n6. A woman of the name of Rusha, who had died of an illness of ten\r\ndays’ duration, and had been six weeks buried, in whom likewise fresh\r\nblood was found in the chest.\r\n\r\n(The reader will understand, that to _see_ blood in the chest, it is\r\nfirst necessary to _cut_ the chest open.)\r\n\r\n7. The body of a girl of ten years of age, who had died two months\r\nbefore. It was likewise in the Vampyr state, perfectly undecomposed,\r\nwith blood in the chest.\r\n\r\n8. The body of the wife of one Hadnuck, buried seven weeks before;\r\nand that of her infant, eight weeks old, buried only twenty-one days.\r\nThey were both in a state of decomposition, though buried in the same\r\nground, and closely adjoining the others.\r\n\r\n9. A servant, by name Rhade, twenty-three years of age; he had died\r\nafter an illness of three months’ duration, and the body had been\r\nburied five weeks. It was in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\n10. The body of the heyduk Stanco, sixty years of age, who had died six\r\nweeks previously. There was much blood and other fluid in the chest and\r\nabdomen, and the body was in the Vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n11. Millac, a heyduk, twenty-five years old. The body had been in the\r\nearth six weeks. It was perfectly in the Vampyr condition.\r\n\r\n12. Stanjoika, the wife of a heyduk, twenty years old; had died after\r\nan illness of three days, and had been buried eighteen. The countenance\r\nwas florid. There was blood in the chest and in the heart. The viscera\r\nwere perfectly sound; the skin remarkably fresh.\r\n\r\nThe document which gives the above particulars is signed by three\r\nregimental surgeons, and formally countersigned by a lieutenant-colonel\r\nand sub-lieutenant. It bears the date of “June 7, 1732, Meduegna near\r\nBelgrade.” No doubt can be entertained of its authenticity, or of\r\nits _general_ fidelity; the less that it does not stand alone, but\r\nis supported by a mass of evidence to the same effect. It appears to\r\nestablish, beyond question, that where the fear of Vampyrism prevails,\r\nand there occur several deaths, in the popular belief connected with\r\nit, the bodies, when disinterred weeks after burial, present the\r\nappearance of corpses from which life has only recently departed.\r\n\r\nWhat inference shall we draw from this fact?—that Vampyrism is true in\r\nthe popular sense?—and that these fresh-looking and well-conditioned\r\ncorpses had some mysterious source of preternatural nourishment? That\r\nwould be to adopt, not to solve the superstition. Let us content\r\nourselves with a notion not so monstrous, but still startling enough:\r\nthat the bodies, which were found in the so-called Vampyr state,\r\ninstead of being in a new or mystical condition, were simply alive\r\nin the common way, or had been so for some time subsequent to their\r\ninterment; that, in short, they were the bodies of persons who\r\nhad been buried alive, and whose life, where it yet lingered, was\r\nfinally extinguished through the ignorance and barbarity of those who\r\ndisinterred them. In the following sketch of a similar scene to that\r\nabove described, the correctness of this inference comes out with\r\nterrific force.\r\n\r\nErasmus Francisci, in his remarks upon the description of the Dukedom\r\nof Krain by Valvasor, speaks of a man of the name of Grando, in the\r\ndistrict of Kring, who died, was buried, and became a Vampyr, and as\r\nsuch was exhumed for the purpose of having a stake thrust through him.\r\n\r\n“When they opened his grave, after he had been long buried, his face\r\nwas found with a colour, and his features made natural sorts of\r\nmovements, as if the dead man smiled. He even opened his mouth as if he\r\nwould inhale fresh air. They held the crucifix before him, and called\r\nin a loud voice, ‘See, this is Jesus Christ who redeemed your soul\r\nfrom hell, and died for you.’ After the sound had acted on his organs\r\nof hearing, and he had connected perhaps some ideas with it, tears\r\nbegan to flow from the dead man’s eyes. Finally, when after a short\r\nprayer for his poor soul, they proceeded to hack off his head, the\r\ncorpse uttered a screech, and turned and rolled just as if it had been\r\nalive—and the grave was full of blood.”\r\n\r\nWe have thus succeeded in interpreting one of the unknown terms in\r\nthe Vampyr theorem. The suspicious character, who had some dark way\r\nof nourishing himself in the grave, turns out to be an unfortunate\r\ngentleman (or lady) whom his friends had buried under a mistake while\r\nhe was still alive, and who, if they afterwards mercifully let him\r\nalone, died sooner or later either naturally or of the premature\r\ninterment—in either case, it is to be hoped, with no interval of\r\nrestored consciousness. The state which thus passed for death and led\r\nto such fatal consequences, apart from superstition, deserves our\r\nserious consideration; for, although of very rare, it is of continual\r\noccurrence, and society is not sufficiently on its guard against a\r\ncontingency so dreadful when overlooked. When the nurse or the doctor\r\nhas announced that all is over—that the valued friend or relative has\r\nbreathed his last—no doubt crosses any one’s mind of the reality of the\r\nsad event. Disease is now so well understood—every step in its march\r\nlaid down and foreseen—the approach of danger accurately estimated—the\r\nliability of the patient, according to his powers of resisting it, to\r\nsuccumb earlier or to hold out longer—all is theoretically so clear\r\nthat a wholesome suspicion of error in the verdict of the attendants\r\nseldom suggests itself. The evil I am considering ought not, however,\r\nto be attributed to redundance of knowledge: it arises from its partial\r\nlack—from a too general neglect of one very important section in\r\npathological science. The laity, if not the doctors too, constantly\r\nlose sight of the fact, that there exists an alternative to the fatal\r\nevent of ordinary disease; that a patient is liable at any period of\r\nillness to deviate, or, as it were, to slide off, from the customary\r\nline of disease into another and a deceptive route—_instead of death,\r\nto encounter apparent death_.\r\n\r\nThe Germans express this condition of the living body by the term\r\n“scheintod,” which signifies exactly _apparent death_; and it is\r\nperhaps a better term than our English equivalent, “suspended\r\nanimation.” But both these expressions are generic terms, and a\r\nspecific term is still wanted to denote the present class of instances.\r\nTo meet this exigency, I propose, for reasons which will afterwards\r\nappear, to employ the term “death-trance” to designate the cases we are\r\ninvestigating.\r\n\r\nDeath-trance is, then, one of the forms of suspended animation: there\r\nare several others. After incomplete poisoning, after suffocation\r\nin either of its various ways, after exposure to cold in infants\r\nnewly born, a state is occasionally met with, of which (however each\r\nmay still differ from the rest) the common feature is an apparent\r\nsuspension of the vital actions. But all of these so-cited instances\r\nagree in another important respect, which second inter-agreement\r\nseparates them as a class from death-trance. They represent, each and\r\nall, a period of conflict between the effects of certain deleterious\r\nimpressions and the vital principle, the latter struggling against the\r\nweight and force of the former. Such is not the case in death-trance.\r\n\r\nDeath-trance is a positive status—a period of repose —the duration of\r\nwhich is sometimes definite and predetermined, though unknown. Thus\r\nthe patient, the term of the death-trance having expired, occasionally\r\nsuddenly wakes, entirely and at once restored. Oftener, however, the\r\nmachinery which has been stopped seems to require to be jogged—then it\r\ngoes on again.\r\n\r\nThe basis of death-trance is suspension of the action of the heart,\r\nand of the breathing, and of voluntary motion; generally likewise\r\nfeeling and intelligence, and the vegetative changes in the body, are\r\nsuspended. With these phenomena is joined loss of external warmth;\r\nso that the usual evidence of life is gone. But there have occurred\r\nvarieties of this condition, in which occasional slight manifestations\r\nof one or other of the vital actions have been observed.\r\n\r\nDeath-trance may occur as a primary affection, suddenly or gradually.\r\nThe diseases the course of which it is liable, as it were, to\r\nbifurcate, or to graft itself upon, are first and principally all\r\ndisorders of the nervous system. But in any form of disease, when the\r\nbody is brought to a certain degree of debility, death-trance may\r\nsupervene. Age and sex have to do with its occurrence; which is more\r\nfrequent in the young than in the old, in women than in men—differences\r\nevidently connected with greater irritability of the nervous system.\r\nAccordingly, women in labour are among the most liable to death-trance,\r\nand it is from such a case that I will give a first instance of the\r\naffection as portrayed by a medical witness. (_Journal des Savans_,\r\n1749.)\r\n\r\nM. Rigaudeaux, surgeon to the military hospital, and licensed accoucher\r\nat Douai, was sent for on the 8th of September, 1745, to attend the\r\nwife of Francis Dumont, residing two leagues from the town. He was\r\nlate in getting there; it was half-past eight, A. M.—too late, it\r\nseemed; the patient was declared to have died at six o’clock, after\r\neighteen hours of ineffectual labour-pains. M. Rigaudeaux inspected\r\nthe body; there was no pulse or breath; the mouth was full of froth,\r\nthe abdomen tumid. He brought away the infant, which he committed to\r\nthe care of the nurses, who, after trying to reanimate it for three\r\nhours, gave up the attempt, and prepared to lay it out, when it opened\r\nits mouth. They then gave it wine, and it was speedily recovered. M.\r\nRigaudeaux, who returned to the house as this occurred, inspected again\r\nthe body of the mother. (It had been already nailed down in a coffin.)\r\nHe examined it with the utmost care; but he came to the conclusion that\r\nit was certainly dead. Nevertheless, as the joints of the limbs were\r\nstill flexible, although seven hours had elapsed since its apparent\r\ndeath, he left the strictest injunctions to watch the body carefully,\r\nto apply stimulants to the nostrils from time to time, to slap the\r\npalms of the hands, and the like. At half-past three o’clock symptoms\r\nof returning animation showed themselves, and the patient recovered.\r\n\r\nThe period during which every ordinary sign of life may be absent,\r\nwithout the prevention of their return, is unknown, but in\r\nwell-authenticated cases it has much exceeded the period observed in\r\nthe above instance. Here is an example borrowed from the _Journal des\r\nSavans_, 1741.\r\n\r\nThere was a Colonel Russell, whose wife, to whom he was affectionately\r\nattached, died, or appeared to do so. But he would not allow the body\r\nto be buried; and threatened to shoot any one who should interfere to\r\nremove it for that purpose. His conduct was guided by reason as well\r\nas by affection and instinct. He said he would not part from the body\r\ntill its decomposition had begun. Eight days had passed, during which\r\nthe body of his wife gave no sign of life: when, as he sat bedewing her\r\nhand with his tears, the church-bell tolled, and, to his unspeakable\r\namazement, his wife sat up and said—“That is the last bell; we shall be\r\ntoo late.” She recovered.\r\n\r\nThere are cases on record of persons, who could spontaneously fall\r\ninto death-trance. Monti, in a letter to Haller, adverts to several;\r\nand mentions, in particular, a peasant upon whom, when he assumed this\r\nstate, the flies would settle; breathing, the pulse, and all ordinary\r\nsigns of life disappeared. A priest of the name of Cælius Rhodaginus\r\nhad the same faculty. But the most celebrated instance is that of\r\nColonel Townshend, mentioned in the surgical works of Gooch, by whom\r\nand by Dr. Cheyne and Dr. Baynard, and by Mr. Shrine, an apothecary,\r\nthe performance of Colonel Townshend was seen and attested. They had\r\nlong attended him, for he was an habitual invalid, and he had often\r\ninvited them to witness the phenomenon of his dying and coming to life\r\nagain; but they had hitherto refused, from fear of the consequences\r\nto himself: at last they assented. Accordingly, in their presence,\r\nColonel Townshend laid himself down on his back, and Dr. Cheyne\r\nundertook to observe his pulse; Dr. Baynard laid his hand on his\r\nheart, and Mr. Shrine had a looking-glass to hold to his mouth. After\r\na few seconds, pulse, breathing, and the action of the heart, were no\r\nlonger to be observed. Each of the witnesses satisfied himself of\r\nthe entire cessation of these phenomena. When the death-trance had\r\nlasted half-an-hour, the doctors began to fear that their patient\r\nhad pushed the experiment too far, and was dead in earnest; and they\r\nwere preparing to leave the house, when a slight movement of the body\r\nattracted their attention. They renewed their routine of observation;\r\nwhen the pulse and sensible motion of the heart gradually returned,\r\nand breathing, and consciousness. The tale ends abruptly. Colonel\r\nTownshend, on recovering, sent for his attorney, made his will, and\r\ndied, for good and all, six hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlthough many have recovered from death-trance, and there seems to\r\nbe in each case a definite period to its duration, yet its event is\r\nnot always so fortunate. The patient sometimes really dies during\r\nits continuance, either unavoidably, or in consequence of adequate\r\nmeasures not being taken to stimulate him to waken, or to support\r\nlife. The following very good instance rests on the authority of Dr.\r\nSchmidt, a physician of the hospital of Paderborn, where it occurred,\r\n(_Rheinisch-Westphälischer Anzeiger_, 1835, No. 57 and 58.)\r\n\r\nA young man of the name of Caspar Kreite, from Berne, died in the\r\nhospital of Paderborn, but his body could not be interred for three\r\nweeks, for the following reasons. During the first twenty-four hours\r\nafter drawing its last breath, the corpse opened its eyes, and the\r\npulse could be felt, for a few minutes, beating feebly and irregularly.\r\nOn the third and fourth day, points of the skin, which had been burned\r\nto test the reality of his death, suppurated. On the fifth day the\r\ncorpse changed the position of one hand: on the ninth day a vesicular\r\neruption appeared on the back. For nine days there was a vertical\r\nfold of the skin of the forehead—a sort of frown—and the features had\r\nnot the character of death. The lips remained red till the eighteenth\r\nday; and the joints preserved their flexibility from first to last.\r\nHe lay in this state in a warm room for nineteen days, without any\r\nfarther alteration than a sensible wasting in flesh. Till after the\r\nnineteenth day no discoloration of the body, or odour of putrefaction,\r\nwas observed. He had been cured of ague, and laboured under a slight\r\nchest affection; but there had been no adequate cause for his death. It\r\nis evident that this person was much more alive than many are in the\r\ndeath-trance; and one half suspects that stimulants and nourishment,\r\nproperly introduced, might have entirely reanimated him.\r\n\r\nI might exemplify death-trance by many a well authenticated romantic\r\nstory.—A noise heard in a vault; the people, instead of breaking open\r\nthe door, go for the keys, and for authority to act, and return too\r\nlate; the unfortunate person is found dead, having previously gnawn her\r\nhand and arm in agony.—A lady is buried with a jewel of value on her\r\nfinger; thieves open the vault to possess themselves of the treasure;\r\nthe ring cannot be drawn from the finger, and the thieves proceed to\r\ncut the finger off; the lady, wakening from her trance, scares the\r\nthieves away, and recovers.—A young married lady dies and is buried; a\r\nformer admirer, to whom her parents had refused her hand, bribes the\r\nsexton to let him see once more the form he loved. The body opportunely\r\ncomes to life at this moment, and flies from Paris with its first lover\r\nto England, where they are married. Venturing to return to France, the\r\nlady is recognised, and is reclaimed by her previous husband through\r\na suit at law; her counsel demurs, on the ground of the desertion and\r\nburial; but the law not admitting this plea, she flies again to England\r\nwith her preserver, to avoid the judgment of the parliament of Paris,\r\nin the acts of which the case stands recorded. There are one or two\r\nother cases that I dare not cite, the particulars of which transcend\r\nthe wildest flights of imagination.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that these are all tales of the olden time; and that\r\nthe very case I have given from the hospital at Paderborn shows that\r\nnow medical men are sufficiently circumspect, and the public really on\r\nits guard to prevent a living person being interred as one dead. And\r\nI grant that in England, among all but the poorest class, the danger\r\nis practically inconsiderable of being buried alive. But that it still\r\nexists for every class, and that for the poor the danger is great and\r\nserious, I am afraid there is too much reason for believing. It is\r\nstated in Froriep’s _Notizen_, 1829, No. 522, that, agreeably to a then\r\nrecent ordinance in New York, coffins presented for burial were kept\r\nabove ground eight days, open at the head, and so arranged, that the\r\nleast movement of the body would ring a bell, through strings attached\r\nto the hands and feet. It will hardly be credited, that _out of twelve\r\nhundred_ whose interment had been thus postponed, _six returned to\r\nlife_—one in every two hundred! The arrangement thus beneficently\r\nadopted at New York is, however, imperfect, as it makes time the\r\ncriterion for interment. The time is _not_ known during which a body\r\nin death-trance may remain alive. Nothing but one positive condition\r\nof the body, which I will presently mention, authenticates death. It\r\nis frightful to think how, in the south of Europe, within twenty-four\r\nhours after the last breath bodies are shovelled into pits among heaped\r\ncorpses; and to imagine what fearful agonies of despair must sometimes\r\nbe encountered by unhappy beings, who wake amid the unutterable horrors\r\nof such a grave. But it is enough to look at home, and to make no delay\r\nin providing there for the careful watching of the bodies of the poor,\r\ntill life has certainly departed. Many do not dream how barbarous and\r\nbackward the vaunted nineteenth century will appear to posterity!\r\n\r\nBut there is another danger to which society is obnoxious through not\r\nmaking sufficient account of the contingency of death-trance, that\r\nappears to me more urgent and menacing than even the risk of being\r\nburied alive.\r\n\r\nThe danger I advert to is not _this_; but this is something—\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Espinosa, prime minister under Philip the Second of Spain,\r\ndied, as it was supposed, after a short illness. His rank entitled him\r\nto be embalmed. Accordingly, the body was opened for that purpose. The\r\nlungs and heart had just been brought into view, when the latter was\r\nseen to beat. The cardinal awakening at the fatal moment, had still\r\nstrength enough left to seize with his hand the knife of the anatomist!\r\n\r\nBut it is _this_—\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of September, 1763, the Abbé Prevost, the French novelist\r\nand compiler of travels, was seized with a fit in the forest of\r\nChantilly. The body was found, and conveyed to the residence of the\r\nnearest clergyman. It was supposed that death had taken place through\r\napoplexy. But the local authorities, desiring to be satisfied of the\r\nfact, ordered the body to be examined. During the process, the poor\r\nabbé uttered a cry of agony.—It was too late.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that cases of sudden and unexplained death are, on\r\nthe one hand, the cases most likely to furnish a large percentage of\r\ndeath-trance; and, on the other, are just those in which the anxiety\r\nof friends or the over-zealousness of a coroner is liable to lead\r\nto premature anatomization. Nor does it even follow that, because\r\nthe body happily did not wake while being dissected, the spark of\r\nlife was therefore extinct. This view, however, is too painful to be\r\nfollowed out in reference to the past. But it imperatively suggests\r\nthe necessity of forbidding necroscopic examinations, before there\r\nis perfect evidence that life has departed—that is, of extending to\r\nthis practice the rule which ought to be made absolute in reference to\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nThus comes out the practical importance of the question, how is it to\r\nbe known that the body is no longer alive?\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of the ordinary signs of life is insufficient to\r\nprove the absence of life. The body may be externally cold; the pulse\r\nnot be felt; breathing may have ceased; no bodily motion may occur; the\r\nlimbs may be stiff (through spasm); the sphincter muscles relaxed; no\r\nblood may flow from an opened vein; the eyes may have become glassy;\r\nthere may be partial _mortification_ to offend the sense with the smell\r\nof death; and yet the body may be alive.\r\n\r\nThe only security we at _present_ know of, that life has left the body,\r\nis the supervention of chemical decomposition, shown in commencing\r\nchange of colour of the integuments of the abdomen and throat to blue\r\nand green, and an attendant cadaverous fetor.\r\n\r\nTo return from this important digression to the former subject of the\r\nVampyr superstition. The second element which we have yet to explain\r\nis the Vampyr visit and its consequence—the lapse of the party visited\r\ninto death-trance. There are two ways of dealing with this knot; one is\r\nto cut it, the other to untie it.\r\n\r\nIt may be cut, by denying the supposed connexion between the Vampyr\r\nvisit and the supervention of death-trance in the second party. Nor\r\nis the explanation thus obtained devoid of plausibility. There is no\r\nreason why death-trance should not, in certain seasons and places, be\r\n_epidemic_. Then the persons most liable to it would be those of weak\r\nand irritable nervous systems. Again, a first effect of the epidemic\r\nmight be further to shake the nerves of weaker subjects. These are\r\nexactly the persons who are likely to be infected with imaginary\r\nterrors, and to dream, or even to fancy, they have seen Mr. or Mrs.\r\nsuch a one, the last victims of the epidemic. The dream or impression\r\nupon the senses might again recur, and the sickening patient have\r\nalready talked of it to his neighbours, before he himself was seized\r\nwith death-trance. On this supposition, the Vampyr visit would sink\r\ninto the subordinate rank of a mere premonitory symptom.\r\n\r\nTo myself, I must confess, this explanation, the best I am yet in a\r\nposition to offer, appears barren and jejune; and not at all to do\r\njustice to the force and frequency, or, as tradition represents the\r\nmatter, the universality of the Vampyr visit as a precursor of the\r\nvictim’s fate. Imagine how strong must have been the conviction of\r\nthe reality of the apparition, how common a feature it must have been,\r\nto have led to the laying down of the unnatural and repulsive process\r\ncustomarily followed at the Vampyr’s grave, as the regular and proper\r\npreventive of ulterior consequences.\r\n\r\nI am disposed, therefore, rather to try and untie this knot, and with\r\nthat object to wait, hoping that something may turn up in the progress\r\nof these inquiries to assist me in its solution. In the mean time, I\r\nwould beg leave to consider this second half of the problem a compound\r\nphenomenon, the solutions of the two parts of which may not emerge\r\nsimultaneously. The Vampyr visit is one thing; its presumed contagious\r\neffect another.\r\n\r\nThe Vampyr visit! Well, it is clear the Vampyr could not have left his\r\ngrave bodily—or, at all events, if he could, he never could have buried\r\nhimself again. Yet in his grave they always found him. So the body\r\ncould not have been the visitant. Then, in popular language, it was the\r\nghost of the Vampyr that haunted its future victim. The ghostly nature\r\nof the visitant could not have been identified at a luckier moment.\r\nThe very subject which I next propose to undertake is the analysis of\r\nghosts. I have, therefore, only to throw the Vampyr ghost into the\r\ncrucible with the rest; and to-morrow I may perhaps be able to report\r\nthe rational composition of the whole batch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n UNREAL GHOSTS—Law of Sensorial Illusions—Cases of Nicolai,\r\n Schwedenborg, Joan of Arc—Fetches—Churchyard ghosts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projected analysis has been crowned with success. The fumes of\r\nsuperstition have been driven off, and the ghosts have been reduced to\r\nrational elements. All trace of supernatural agency has vanished; and\r\nin its place are found three principles—one physical, two psychical—by\r\nthe help of which every conceivable ghost may in future be alternately\r\ndecomposed and recompounded by the merest tyro.\r\n\r\nThe first of which I shall describe the nature and operation is a\r\npsychical truth, already known to most persons of education. It is of\r\nvery general use in ghost-building; it forms the immediate _personnel_\r\nof every ghost; and is of so active a nature that alone, or assisted\r\nby a little credulity, it is enough to constitute the simplest kind—a\r\ncommon fetch. Mixed with a dose of mental anxiety, or as much remorse\r\nas will lie on the point of a dagger, it will form a troublesome\r\nretrospective ghost. The second principle—a physical one, less\r\ngenerally known—is the basis of that sturdy apparition the churchyard\r\nghost, which it will turn out in very fair style aided by fancy\r\nalone; but, to perfect the illusive result, the co-operation of the\r\nfirst principle is necessary. The third, an entirely new one, is the\r\nfoundation of real ghosts—that is, of ghosts which announce unexpected\r\nevents, distant in space or time; the same principle is concerned in\r\ntrue dreams, and in second-sight.\r\n\r\nThe first of the three principles adverted to is the physiological\r\nfact that, when the blood is heated, the nervous system overstrained,\r\nor digestion out of sorts, the thereby directly or sympathetically\r\ndisordered brain is liable to project before us illusory forms, which\r\nare coloured and move like life, and are so far undistinguishable from\r\nreality. Sometimes a second sense is drawn into the phantasmagoria, and\r\nthe fictitious beings speak as you do. Almost always the illusion stops\r\nthere. But in one or two marvellous cases, the touch has been involved\r\nin the hallucination, and the ghost has been tangible. These phenomena\r\nare termed sensorial illusions. The visual part of them, the first\r\nand commonest, has been the most attended to. The cause immediately\r\nproducing it appears to be an affection, not of the organ of vision,\r\nbut of that part of the brain in which the nerves of seeing take their\r\norigin. This organ it is which in health realizes our sensations of\r\ncolour, and converts them into visual perceptions. Like other parts of\r\nthe brain, it is stored with memories of its past impressions, ready\r\nto be evoked—either pure and true by conception, or any how combined\r\nby fancy. In perfect health, a chance moment of warm recollection will\r\ncall up from this source the once familiar face transiently, but how\r\ndistinctly!\r\n\r\nIn its morbid state, the beings it projects before us are for the\r\nmost part strangers, just as the personages we meet in our dreams are\r\nexceptionally only our living and present acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe most instructive case of sensorial illusions on record, as\r\ncontaining the largest illustration of the phenomena, is that of\r\nNicolai, the bookseller of Berlin. The narrative was read before\r\nthe Academy of Sciences at Berlin, in 1799. Its substance runs\r\nthus:—Nicolai had met with some family troubles, which much disturbed\r\nhim. Then, on the first of January, 1791, there stood before him, at\r\nthe distance of ten paces, the ghost of his eldest son. He pointed at\r\nit, directing his wife to look. She saw it not, and tried to convince\r\nNicolai that it was an illusion. In a quarter of an hour it vanished.\r\nIn the afternoon, at four o’clock, it came again. Nicolai was alone.\r\nHe went to his wife’s room, the ghost followed him. About six other\r\napparitions joined the first, and they walked about among each other.\r\nAfter some days the apparition of his son stayed away; but its place\r\nwas filled with the figures of a number of persons, some known, some\r\nunknown to Nicolai—some of dead, others of living persons. The known\r\nones represented distant acquaintances only. The figures of none of\r\nNicolai’s habitual friends were there. The appearances were almost\r\nalways human; occasionally a man on horseback, and birds, and dogs,\r\nwould present themselves. The apparitions came mostly after dinner,\r\nat the commencement of digestion; they were just like real persons,\r\nthe colouring a thought fainter. The apparitions were equally distinct\r\nwhether Nicolai was alone or in society, in the dark as by day; in his\r\nown house or in those of others; but in the latter case they were less\r\nfrequent, and they very seldom made their appearance in the streets.\r\nDuring the first eight days they seemed to take very little notice of\r\none another, but walked about like people at a fair, only here and\r\nthere communing with each other. They took no notice of Nicolai, or\r\nof the remarks he addressed regarding them to his wife and physician.\r\nNo effort of his would dismiss them, or bring an absent one back.\r\nWhen he shut his eyes, they sometimes disappeared, sometimes remained;\r\nwhen he opened his eyes, they were there as before. After a week they\r\nbecame more numerous, and began to converse. They conversed with\r\none another first, and then addressed him. Their remarks were short\r\nand unconnected, but sensible and civil. His acquaintances inquired\r\nafter his health, and expressed sympathy with him, and spoke in terms\r\ncomforting him. The apparitions were most conversable when he was\r\nalone; nevertheless, they mingled in the conversation when others were\r\nby, and their voices had the same sound as those of real persons. The\r\nillusion went on thus from the 24th of February to the 20th of April;\r\nso that Nicolai, who was in good bodily health, had time to become\r\ntranquillized about the nature of his visiters, and to observe them\r\nat his ease. At last they rather amused him; then the doctors thought\r\nof an efficient plan of treatment. They prescribed leeches; and then\r\nfollowed the “denouement” of this interesting representation. The\r\napparitions became pale, and vanished. On the 20th of April, at the\r\ntime of applying the leeches, Nicolai’s room was full of figures moving\r\nabout among each other. They first began to have a less lively motion;\r\nshortly afterwards their colours became paler, in another half hour\r\npaler still, though the forms still remained. About seven o’clock in\r\nthe evening the figures had become colourless, and they moved scarcely\r\nat all; but their outline was still tolerably perfect. Gradually that\r\nbecame less and less defined; at last they disappeared, breaking into\r\nair, fragments only remaining, which at last all vanished. By eight\r\no’clock all were gone, and Nicolai subsequently saw no more of them.\r\n\r\nIn general, as in Nicolai’s case, the sight is the sense at first and\r\nalone affected. Illusions of the hearing, if they occur, follow later.\r\nIn some most extraordinary cases, I have observed that the touch has\r\nlikewise participated in the affection; the following is an instance:—\r\n\r\nHerr von Baczko, already subject to visual hallucinations of a\r\ndiseased nervous system, his right side weak with palsy, his right eye\r\nblind, and the vision of the left imperfect, was engaged one evening\r\nshortly after the battle of Jena, as he tells in his autobiography, in\r\ntranslating a pamphlet into Polish, when he felt a poke in his loins.\r\nHe looked round, and found that it proceeded from a Negro or Egyptian\r\nboy, seemingly about twelve years of age. Although he was persuaded the\r\nwhole was an illusion, he thought it best to knock the apparition down,\r\nwhen he felt that it offered a sensible resistance. The Negro then\r\nattacked him on the other side, and gave his left arm a particularly\r\ndisagreeable twist, when Baczko again pushed him off. The Negro\r\ncontinued to visit him constantly during four months, preserving the\r\nsame appearance, and remaining tangible; then he came seldomer; and,\r\nfinally appearing as a brown-coloured apparition with an owl’s head, he\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\nSensorial illusions, technically speaking, are not mental delusions;\r\nor they become so only when they are believed to be realities. So\r\nsensorial illusions are not insanity, neither do they menace that\r\ndisorder: they are not its customary precursors. Nevertheless, they\r\nmay accompany the first outbreak of madness; and they occur much more\r\nfrequently in lunatics than in persons of sound mind. In insanity they\r\nare firmly believed in by the patient, whose delusions they may either\r\nsuggest or be shaped by. In insanity, illusions of the hearing often\r\noccur alone, which is comparatively rare in sane people.\r\n\r\nThe objects of visual illusions are commonly men and women; but\r\nanimals, and even inanimate objects, sometimes constitute them. A lady\r\nwhose sight was failing her had long visions every day of rows of\r\nbuildings, houses, and parks, and such like. The subjects of visual\r\nillusions are generally perfectly trivial, like the events of a common\r\ndream. But, though susceptible of change, their custom is to recur with\r\nmuch the same character daily. One patient could at will summon the\r\napparition of an acquaintance to join the rest; but, once there, he\r\ncould not get rid of him.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens that sensorial illusions are in accordance with\r\na congenial train of thought—for instance, with peculiar impressions\r\nreferring to religion. They are then very liable to be construed by the\r\npatient into realities, and to materially influence his conversation\r\nand conduct. He remains, no doubt, strictly sane in the midst of these\r\ndelusions. But he is apt not to be thought so; or, to use a figure, the\r\nworld’s opinion of such a person becomes a polar force, and society is\r\ndivided into his admiring followers and those who think him a lunatic.\r\nSuch was, and remains, the fate of Schwedenborg.\r\n\r\nSchwedenborg, the son of a Swedish clergyman of the name of Schwedberg,\r\nennobled as Schwedenborg, was up to the year 1743, which was the\r\nfifty-fourth of his age, an ordinary man of the world, distinguished\r\nonly in literature, having written many volumes on philosophy and\r\nscience, and being professor in the Mineralogical School, where he was\r\nmuch respected. On a sudden, in the year 1743, he believed himself to\r\nhave got into a commerce with the world of spirits, which so fully\r\ntook possession of his thoughts, that he not only published their\r\nrevelations, but was in the habit of detailing their daily chat with\r\nhim. Thus he says, “I had a conversation the other day on that very\r\npoint with the apostle Paul,” or with Luther, or some other dead\r\nperson. Schwedenborg continued in what he believed to be constant\r\ncommunion with spirits till his death, in 1772. He was, without doubt,\r\nin the fullest degree convinced of the reality of his spiritual\r\ncommerce. So in a letter to the Wurtemburg Prelate, Oetinger, dated\r\nNovember 11, 1766, he uses the following words: “If I have spoken with\r\nthe apostles? To this I answer, I conversed with St. Paul during a\r\nwhole year, particularly with reference to the text, Romans iii. 28.\r\nI have three times conversed with St. John, once with Moses, and a\r\nhundred times with Luther, who allowed that it was against the warning\r\nof an angel that he professed _fidem solam_, and that he stood alone\r\nupon the separation from the Pope. With angels, finally, have I these\r\ntwenty years conversed, and converse daily.”\r\n\r\nOf the angels, he says, “They have human forms, the appearance of\r\nmen, as I have a thousand times seen; for I have spoken with them\r\nas a man with other men—often with several together—and I have seen\r\nnothing in the least to distinguish them from other men.” They had, in\r\nfact, exactly the same appearance as Nicolai’s visiters. “Lest any\r\none should call this an illusion, or imaginary perception, it is to\r\nbe understood that I am accustomed to see them when myself perfectly\r\nwide awake, and in full exercise of my observation. The speech of an\r\nangel, or of a spirit, sounds like and as loud as that of a man; but\r\nit is not heard by the bystanders. The reason is, that _the speech of\r\nan angel, or a spirit, finds entrance first into a man’s thoughts, and\r\nreaches his organs of hearing from within_.” A wonderful instance this\r\nlast reason how it is possible _cum ratione insanire_; he analyzes the\r\nillusion perfectly, even when he is most deceived by it.\r\n\r\n“The angels who converse with men speak not in their own language, but\r\nin the language of the country; and likewise in other languages which\r\nare known to a man, not in languages which he does not understand.”\r\nSchwedenborg here interrupted the angels, and, to explain the matter,\r\nobserved that they most likely appeared to speak his mother tongue,\r\n_because, in fact_, it was not they who spoke, but himself after their\r\nsuggestions. The angels would not allow this, and went away at the\r\nclose of the conversation unpersuaded.\r\n\r\nThe following fiction is very fine: “When approaching, the angels often\r\nappear like a ball of light; and they travel in companies so grouped\r\ntogether—they are allowed so to unite by the Lord—that they may act as\r\none being, and share each other’s ideas and knowledge; and in this form\r\nthey bound through the universe, from planet to planet.”\r\n\r\nA still more interesting example of the influence of sensorial\r\nillusions on human conduct is furnished by the touching history of Joan\r\nof Arc.\r\n\r\n“It is now seven years ago,” so spoke before her judges the simple but\r\nhigh-minded maiden—“it was a summer day, towards the middle hour,\r\nI was about thirteen years old, and was in my father’s garden, that\r\nI heard for the first time, on my right hand, towards the church, a\r\nvoice, and there stood a figure in a bright radiance before my eyes.\r\nIt had the appearance and look of a right good and virtuous man, bore\r\nwings, was surrounded with light on all sides, and by the angels of\r\nheaven. It was the archangel Michael. The voice seemed to me to command\r\nrespect; but I was yet a child, and was frightened at the figure, and\r\ndoubted very much whether it were the archangel. I saw him and the\r\nangels as distinctly before my eyes as I now see you, my judges.” With\r\nwords of encouragement the archangel announced to her that God had\r\ntaken pity upon France, and that she must hasten to the assistance of\r\nthe King. At the same time he promised her that St. Catharine and St.\r\nMargaret would shortly visit her: he told her that she should do what\r\nthey commanded her, because they were sent by God to guide and conduct\r\nher. “Upon this,” continued Joan, “St. Catharine and St. Margaret\r\nappeared to me, as the archangel had foretold. They ordered me to get\r\nready to go to Robert de Beaudricourt, the King’s captain. He would\r\nseveral times refuse me, but at last would consent, and give me people\r\nwho would conduct me to the King. Then should I raise the siege of\r\nOrleans. I replied to them that I was a poor child, who understood\r\nnothing about riding on horseback and making war. They said I should\r\ncarry my banner with courage; God would help me, and win back for my\r\nking his entire kingdom. As soon as I knew,” continued Joan, “that I\r\nwas to proceed on this errand, I avoided as much as I could taking part\r\nin the sports and amusements of my young companions.” “So have the\r\nsaints conducted me during seven years, and have given me support and\r\nassistance in all my need and labours; and now at present,” said she to\r\nher judges, “no day goes by but they come to see me.” “I seldom see\r\nthe saints that they are not surrounded with a halo of light; they wear\r\nrich and precious crowns, as it is reasonable they should. I see them\r\nalways under the same forms, and have never found in their discourse\r\nany discrepancies. I know how to distinguish one from the other, and\r\ndistinguish them as well by the sound of their voices as by their\r\nsalutation. They come often without my calling upon them. But when they\r\ndo not come, I pray to the Lord that he will send them to me; and never\r\nhave I needed them but they have visited me.”\r\n\r\nSuch is part of the defence of the heroic Joan of Arc, who was taken\r\nprisoner by the Duke of Burgundy on the 23d of May, 1430—sold by him\r\nfor a large sum to the English, and by them put on her trial as a\r\nheretic, idolatress, and magician—condemned, and finally burned alive\r\non the 30th of May, 1431!\r\n\r\nHer innocence, simplicity, and courage incense one sadly against her\r\njudges; but it is likely there were at that time many good and sensible\r\npersons who approved of her sentence, and never suspected its cruelty\r\nand injustice. Making allowance for the ignorance and barbarity of the\r\nage, her treatment was, perhaps, not worse than that of Abd-el-Kader\r\nnow. Her visions—they were palpably the productions of her own fancy,\r\nthe figures of saints and angels, which she had seen in missals,\r\nprojected before her mental sight; and their cause the instinctive\r\nworkings, unknown to herself, of her young high-couraged and\r\nenthusiastic heart, shaping its suggestions into holy prophesyings—the\r\nleading facts of which her resolute will realized, while their actual\r\ndiscrepancies with subsequent events she pardonably forgot.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I cannot deny that another principle, afterwards to be\r\nexplained, may have been additionally in operation in this interesting\r\ncase.]\r\n\r\nI will present yet another and less pleasing picture, where the subject\r\nof sensorial illusions was of infirm mind, and they struck upon the\r\ninsane chord, and reason jangled harshly out of tune. It would be a\r\ncurious question whether such a sensorial illusion as overthrew the\r\nyoung seer’s judgment in the following case, could have occurred to a\r\nmind previously sane; whether, for instance, it could have occurred to\r\nSchwedenborg, and, in that event, how he would have dealt with it.\r\n\r\nArnold (a German writer) relates, in his history of the church and of\r\nheresy, how there was a young man in Königsberg, well educated, the\r\nnatural son of a priest, who had the impression that he was met near a\r\ncrucifix on the wayside by seven angels, who revealed to him that he\r\nwas to represent God the Father on earth, to drive all evil out of the\r\nworld, &c. The poor fellow, after pondering upon this illusion a long\r\ntime, issued a circular, beginning thus:\r\n\r\n“We John, Albrecht, Adelgreif, Syrdos, Amata, Kanemata, Kilkis,\r\nMataldis, Schmalkilimundis, Sabrandis, Elioris, Hyperarch-High-priest\r\nand Emperor, Prince of Peace of the whole world, Hyperarch-King of the\r\nholy kingdom of Heaven, Judge of the living and of the dead, God and\r\nFather, in whose divinity Christ will come on the last day to judge the\r\nworld, Lord of all lords, King of all kings,” &c.\r\n\r\nHe was thereupon thrown into prison at Königsberg, where every means\r\nwere used by the clergy to reclaim him from these blasphemous and\r\nheretical notions. To all their entreaties, however, he listened only\r\nwith a smile of pity—“that they should think of reclaiming God the\r\nFather.” He was then put to the torture, and as what he endured made no\r\nalteration in his convictions, he was condemned to have his tongue torn\r\nout with red-hot tongs, to be cut in four quarters, and then burned\r\nunder the gallows. He wept bitterly, not at his own fate, but that they\r\nshould pronounce such a sentence on the Deity. The executioner was\r\ntouched with pity, and implored him to make a final recantation. But\r\nhe persisted that he was God the Father, whether they pulled his tongue\r\nout by the roots or not; and so he was executed!\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding forcible illustrations of the working of sensorial\r\nillusions on individual minds, it is to descend a little in interest\r\nto trace their ministry in giving rise to the rickety forms of popular\r\nsuperstition. However, the material may be the same, whether it be\r\ncast for the commemoration of a striking event or coined for vulgar\r\ncurrency. And here is a piece of the latter description, with the\r\nrecommendation of being at least fresh from the mint, and spic-and-span\r\nnew—an instance of superstition surviving in England in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, who has recently left Oxford, told me that he was\r\none evening at a supper-party in college, when they were joined by a\r\ncommon friend on his return from hunting. They expected him, but were\r\nstruck with his appearance. He was pale and agitated. On questioning\r\nhim, they learned the cause. During the latter part of his ride home,\r\nhe had been accompanied by a horseman, who kept exact pace with him,\r\nthe rider and horse being close facsimiles of himself and the steed\r\nhe rode, even to the copy of a new fangled bit which he sported that\r\nday for the first time. He had, in fact, seen his “double” or “Fetch,”\r\nand it had shaken his nerves pretty considerably. His friends advised\r\nhim to consult the college-tutor, who failed not to give him some good\r\nadvice, and hoped the warning would not be thrown away. My informant,\r\nwho thought the whole matter very serious, and was inclined to believe\r\nthe unearthly visit to have been no idle one, added that it had made\r\nthe ghost-seer, for the time at least, a wiser and better man.\r\n\r\nSuch a visionary duplicate of one’s-self—one’s fetch—is a not\r\nunfrequent form of sensorial illusion. In more ignorant days the\r\nappearance of a fetch excited much apprehension. It was supposed to\r\nmenace death or serious calamity to its original. Properly viewed,\r\nunless it proceed from hard work and overstrained thought, (from which\r\nyou can desist,) it indicates something wrong in your physical health,\r\nand its warning goes no further than to consult a doctor, to learn,\r\n“what rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug will drive the spectre\r\nhence.” The efficiency of such means was shown in the case of Nicolai.\r\nYet in this case, I may remark, the originating cause of the attack\r\nhad been anxiety about the very son whose apparition was the first of\r\nthe throng to visit him. Had the illusion continued limited to the\r\nfigure of the son, it would have been more questionable what art could\r\ndo towards dismissing it. At all events, in such a case, the first\r\nthing is to remove the perilous stuff that weighs upon the mind. So the\r\npersonage whose words I have been using was doubtless right, in his own\r\ncase, to “throw physic to the dogs.”\r\n\r\nIn the tragedy of _Macbeth_, sensorial illusions are made to play their\r\npart with curious physiological correctness. The mind of Macbeth is\r\nworn by the conflict between ambition and duty. At last his better\r\nresolves give way; and his excited fancy projects before him the fetch\r\nof his own dagger, which marshals him the way that he shall go. The\r\nspectator is thus artistically prepared for the further working of\r\nthe same infirmity in the apparition of Banquo, which, unseen by his\r\nguests, is visible only to the conscience-stricken murderer. With a\r\nscientific precision no less admirable, the partner of his guilt—_a\r\nwoman_—is made to have attacks of trance, (_to which women are more\r\nliable than men_,) caused by her disturbed mind; and in her trance\r\nthe exact physiological character of one form of that disorder is\r\nportrayed—_she enacts a dream_, which is the essence of somnambulism.\r\n\r\nOne almost doubts whether Shakspeare was aware of the philosophic truth\r\ndisplayed in these master-strokes of his own art. The apparitions\r\nconjured up in the witch scenes of the same play, and the ghost in\r\n_Hamlet_, are moulded on the pattern of vulgar superstition. He employs\r\nindifferently the baser metal and the truthful inspirations of his own\r\ngenius—realizing Shelley’s strange figure of\r\n\r\n              “a poet hidden\r\n    In the light of thought.”\r\n\r\nSo they say the sun is himself dark as a planet, and his atmosphere\r\nalone the source of light, through the gaps in which his common earth\r\nis seen. I am tempted—but it would be idle, and I refrain—to quote\r\nan expression or two, or a passage, from Shakspeare, exemplifying\r\nhis wonderful turn for approximating to truths of which he must have\r\nbeen ignorant—where lines of admired and unaccountable beauty have\r\nunexpectedly acquired lucidity and appositeness through modern science.\r\nWhile, to make a quaint comparison, his great contemporary, Bacon,\r\nemployed the lamp of his imagination to illuminate the paths to the\r\ndiscovery of truth, Shakspeare would, with random intuition, seize\r\non the undiscovered truths themselves, and use them to vivify the\r\nconceptions of his fancy.\r\n\r\nLet me now turn to explain a ghost of a more positive description—the\r\nchurchyard ghost. The ghost will perhaps exclaim against so trivial\r\na title, and one so unjust in reference to old superstition; but it\r\nwill be seen he deserves no better. In popular story he had a higher\r\noffice; his duty was to watch the body over which church rites had not\r\nbeen performed, that had been rudely inearthed after violent death. As\r\nthus—\r\n\r\nThere was a cottage in a village I could name to which a bad report\r\nattached. More than one who had slept in it had seen, at midnight, the\r\nradiant apparition of a little child standing on the hearth-stone. At\r\nlength suspicion was awakened. The hearth-stone was raised, and there\r\nwere found buried beneath it the remains of an infant. A story was now\r\ndivulged how the last tenant and a female of the village had abruptly\r\nquitted the neighbourhood. The ghost was real and significant enough.\r\n\r\nBut here is a still better instance from a trustworthy German work, P.\r\nKieffer’s _Archives_. The narrative was communicated by Herr Ehrman of\r\nStrasburg, son-in-law of the well-known writer Pfeffel, from whom he\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\nThe ghost-seer was a young candidate for orders, eighteen years of age,\r\nof the name of Billing. He was known to have very excitable nerves, had\r\nalready experienced sensorial illusions, and was particularly sensitive\r\nto the presence of human remains, which made him tremble and shudder\r\nin all his limbs. Pfeffel, being blind, was accustomed to take the arm\r\nof this young man, and they walked thus together in Pfeffel’s garden,\r\nnear Colmar. At one spot in the garden, Pfeffel remarked that his\r\ncompanion’s arm gave a sudden start, as if he had received an electric\r\nshock. Being asked what was the matter, Billing replied, “Nothing.” But\r\non their going over the same spot again, the same effect recurred. The\r\nyoung man being pressed to explain the cause of his disturbance, avowed\r\nthat it arose from a peculiar sensation which he always experienced\r\nwhen in the vicinity of human remains; that it was his impression a\r\nhuman body must be interred there; but that, if Pfeffel would return\r\nwith him at night, he should be able to speak with greater confidence.\r\nAccordingly they went together to the garden when it was dark, and\r\nas they approached the spot, Billing observed a faint light over it.\r\nAt ten paces from it he stopped, and would go no farther, for he saw\r\nhovering over it, or self-supported in the air—its feet only a few\r\ninches from the ground—a luminous female figure, nearly five feet high,\r\nwith the right arm folded on her breast, the left hanging by her side.\r\nWhen Pfeffel himself stepped forward and placed himself about where\r\nthe figure appeared to be, Billing said it was now on his right hand,\r\nnow on his left, now behind, now before him. When Pfeffel cut the air\r\nwith his stick, it seemed as if it went through and divided a light\r\nflame, which then united again. The visit, repeated the next night, in\r\ncompany with some of Pfeffel’s relatives, gave the same result. They\r\ndid not see any thing. Pfeffel then, unknown to the ghost-seer, had\r\nthe ground dug up, when there was found at some depth, beneath a layer\r\nof quicklime, a human body in progress of decomposition. The remains\r\nwere removed, and the earth carefully replaced. Three days afterwards,\r\nBilling, from whom this whole proceeding had been kept concealed,\r\nwas again led to the spot by Pfeffel. He walked over it now without\r\nexperiencing any unusual impression whatever.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this mysterious phenomenon has been but recently\r\narrived at. The discoveries of Von Reichenbach, of which I gave a\r\nsketch in the first letter, announce the principle on which it depends.\r\nAmong these discoveries is the fact that the Od force makes itself\r\nvisible as a dim light or waving flame to highly sensitive subjects.\r\nSuch persons, in the dark, see flames issuing from the poles of magnets\r\nand crystals. Von Reichenbach eventually discovered that the Od force\r\nis distributed universally, although in varying quantities. But among\r\nthe causes which excite its evolution, one of the most active is\r\nchemical decomposition. Then, happening to remember Pfeffel’s ghost\r\nstory, it occurred to Von Reichenbach that what Billing had seen was\r\npossibly Od light. To test the soundness of this conjecture, Miss\r\nReichel, a very sensitive subject, was taken at night to an extensive\r\nburying-ground near Vienna, where interments take place daily, and\r\nthere are many thousand graves. The result did not disappoint Von\r\nReichenbach’s expectations. Whithersoever Miss Reichel turned her\r\neyes, she saw masses of flame. This appearance manifested itself most\r\nabout recent graves. About very old ones it was not visible. She\r\ndescribed the appearance as resembling less bright flame than fiery\r\nvapour, something between fog and flame. In several instances the light\r\nextended four feet in height above the ground. When Miss Reichel placed\r\nher hand on it, it seemed to her involved in a cloud of fire. When she\r\nstood in it, it came up to her throat. She expressed no alarm, being\r\naccustomed to the appearance.\r\n\r\nThe mystery has thus been entirely solved; for it is evident that the\r\nspectral character of the luminous apparition, in the two instances\r\nwhich I have narrated, had been supplied by the seers themselves. So\r\nthe superstition has vanished; but, as usual, it veiled a truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n TRUE GHOSTS.—The apparitions themselves always sensorial\r\n illusions—The truth of their communications accounted for—Zschokke’s\r\n Seer-gift described, to show the possibility of direct mental\r\n communication—Second-sight—The true relation of the mind to the living\r\n body.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst of a true ghost is, that, to be sure of his genuineness—that\r\nis, of his veracity—one must wait the event. He is distinguished by no\r\nsensible and positive characteristics from the commoner herd. There is\r\nnothing in his outward appearance to raise him in your opinion above\r\na fetch. But even this fact is not barren. His dress,—it is in the\r\nordinary mode of the time, in nothing overdone. To be dressed thus\r\ndoes credit to his taste, as to be dressed at all evinces his sense\r\nof propriety; but alas! the same elements convict him of objective\r\nunreality. Whence come that aerial coat and waistcoat, whence those\r\nvisionary trousers?—alas! they can only have issued from the wardrobe\r\nin the seer’s fancy. And, like his dress, the wearer is imaginary, a\r\nmere sensorial illusion, without a shadow of externality; he is not\r\nmore substantial than a dream.\r\n\r\nBut dreams have differences of quality no less than ghosts. All do not\r\ncome through the ivory gate. Some are true and significant enough. See,\r\nthere glides one skulking assassin-like into the shade,—he not long\r\nsince killed his man; “Hilloa, ill-favoured Dream! come hither and give\r\nan account of yourself.” (Enter Dream.)\r\n\r\nA Scottish gentleman and his wife were travelling four or five years\r\nago in Switzerland. There travelled with them a third party, an\r\nintimate friend, a lady, who some time before had been the object of\r\na deep attachment on the part of a foreigner, a Frenchman. Well, she\r\nwould have nothing to say to him on the topic uppermost in his mind,\r\nbut she gave him a good deal of serious advice, which she probably\r\nthought he wanted; and she ultimately promoted, or was a cognizant\r\nparty to, his union with a lady whom she likewise knew. The so-married\r\ncouple were now in America; and the lady occasionally heard from them,\r\nand had every reason to believe they were both in perfect health.\r\nOne morning, on their meeting at breakfast, she told her companions\r\nthat she had had a very impressive dream the night before, which had\r\nrecurred twice. The scene was a room in which lay a coffin; near to it\r\nstood her ex-lover in a luminous transfigured resplendent state; his\r\nwife was by, looking much as usual. The dream had caused the lady some\r\nmisgivings, but her companions exhorted her to view it as a trick of\r\nher fancy, and she was half persuaded so to do. The dream, however, was\r\nright, notwithstanding. In process of time, letters arrived announcing\r\nthe death, after a short illness, of the French gentleman, within the\r\ntwenty-four hours in which the vision appeared. (Sensation—applause,\r\nfollowed by cries of Shame; the Dream, hurrying away, is hurt by the\r\nhorn of the gate.)\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to persuade the lady who dreamed this dream that\r\nthere was no connexion between it and the event it foreshadowed in\r\nher mind beyond the accidental coincidence of time. Nevertheless, to\r\nthis conclusion an indifferent auditor would probably come; and upon\r\nthe following reasoning: We sometimes dream of the death of an absent\r\nfriend when he is alive and in health, just as we sometimes dream that\r\nlong-lost friends are alive. And it is quite possible—nay, likely to\r\noccur in the chapter of accidents—nay, certain to turn up now and then\r\namong the dreams of millions during centuries—that a fortuitous dream,\r\nseemingly referring to the fact, should be coincident in point of time\r\nwith the death of a distant friend. To explain one such case, we need\r\nlook no further than to the operation of chance. Why, then, ever seek\r\nanother principle?\r\n\r\nLet us examine a parallel ghost-story. A gentleman has a relative in\r\nIndia, healthy, of good constitution, in the civil service, prosperous:\r\nhe has no cause for anxiety, and entertains none, respecting his\r\nrelative. But one day he sees his ghost. In due course letters arrive\r\nmentioning the occurrence of his relative’s death on that day. The\r\ncase is more remarkable than the last; for the ghost-seer never in\r\nhis life _but that once_ experienced a sensorial illusion. Still, it\r\nis evidently possible that the two events were, through chance alone,\r\ncoincident in time. And if in this case, why not in another?\r\n\r\nThen let me adduce a more remarkable instance: A late General Wynyard,\r\nand the late General Sir John Sherbroke, when young men, were serving\r\nin Canada. One day—it was daylight—Mr. Wynyard and Mr. Sherbroke both\r\nsaw pass through the room where they sat a figure, which Mr. Wynyard\r\nrecognised as a brother then far away. One of the two walked to the\r\ndoor, and looked out upon the landing-place, but the stranger was not\r\nthere; and a servant who was on the stairs had seen nobody pass out. In\r\ntime news arrived that Mr. Wynyard’s brother had died about the time of\r\nthe visit of the apparition.\r\n\r\nI have had opportunities of inquiring of two near relations of this\r\nGeneral Wynyard upon what evidence the above story rests. They told me\r\nthey had each heard it from his own mouth. More recently, a gentleman,\r\nwhose accuracy of recollection exceeds that of most people, has told me\r\nthat he had heard the late Sir John Sherbroke, the other party in the\r\nghost-story, tell it much in the same way at a dinner-table.\r\n\r\nOne does not feel as comfortably satisfied that the complicated\r\ncoincidences in this tale admit of being referred to chance. The\r\nodds are enormous against two persons—young men in perfect health,\r\nneither of whom before or after this event experienced a sensorial\r\nillusion—being the subjects at the same moment of one, their common\r\nand only one, which concurred in point of time with an event that\r\nit foreshadowed, unless there were some real connexion between the\r\nevent and the double apparition. And we feel a nascent inclination to\r\ninquire whether—in case such instances as the present occasionally\r\nrecur, and instances like the two before narrated become, when looked\r\nfor, startlingly multiplied—there exists any known mental or physical\r\nprinciple, by the help of which they may be explained into natural\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe more we look after facts of the above nature, the more urgent\r\nbecomes the want of such a means of explanation. In every family\r\ncircle, in every party of men accidentally brought together, you will\r\nbe sure to hear, if the conversation fall on ghosts and dreams, one or\r\nmore instances—which the narrators represent as well authenticated—of\r\nintimations of the deaths of absent persons conveyed to friends either\r\nthrough an apparition or a dream, or an equivalent unaccountable\r\npresentiment. A gentleman—himself of distinguished ability—told me that\r\nwhen he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, he was secretary to a ghost\r\nsociety formed in sportive earnest by some of the cleverest young men\r\nof one of the best modern periods of the university. One of the results\r\nof their labours was the collection of about a dozen stories of the\r\nabove description resting upon good evidence.\r\n\r\nThen there transpire occasionally cases with more curious features\r\nstill. Not only is the general intimation of an event given, but minute\r\nparticulars attending it are figured in the dream, or communicated by\r\nthe ghost. Such tales have sometimes been authenticated in courts of\r\njustice. Here is one out of last week’s newspaper:—\r\n\r\n“In a Durham paper of last week, there was an account of the\r\ndisappearance of Mr. Smith, gardener to Sir Clifford Constable, who, it\r\nwas supposed, had fallen into the river Tees, his hat and stick having\r\nbeen found near the water-side. From that time up to Friday last the\r\nriver had been dragged every day; but every effort so made to find the\r\nbody proved ineffectual. On the night of Thursday, however, a person\r\nnamed Awde, residing at little Newsham, a small village about four\r\nmiles from Wycliff, dreamt that Smith was laid under the ledge of a\r\ncertain rock, about three hundred yards below Whorlton Bridge, and that\r\n_his right arm was broken_. Awde got up early on Friday, and his dream\r\nhad such an effect upon him that he determined to go and search the\r\nriver. He accordingly started off for that purpose, without mentioning\r\nthe matter, being afraid that he would be laughed at by his neighbours.\r\nNevertheless, on his arriving at the boat-house, he disclosed his\r\nobject on the man asking him for what purpose he required the boat.\r\nHe rowed to the spot he had seen in his dream; and there, strange to\r\nsay, upon the very first trial that he made with his boat-hook, he\r\npulled up the body of the unfortunate man, with his right arm actually\r\nbroken.”—(_Herald_, December, 1848.)\r\n\r\nReviewing all that I have advanced, it appears to me that there are two\r\ndesiderata which pressingly require to be now supplied. First, some\r\none should take the pains of authenticating at the time, and putting\r\non permanent record, stories like the above, to be at the service\r\nof future speculators. But, secondly, so numerous and well attested\r\nare those already current, that the bringing forward into light of\r\nsome principle by which they may be shown to be natural events is now\r\nperemptorily called for.\r\n\r\nTo lead to the supply of the second desideratum, I proceed to mention\r\na physical phenomenon, which from time to time occurred to the late\r\nhistorian and novelist, Heinrich Zschokke. It is described by him in\r\na sort of autobiography, entitled _Selbstschau_, which he published\r\na few years ago. It was only last year that Zschokke died, having\r\nattained a good old age. Early brought into public life in the troubles\r\nof Switzerland, and afterwards maintaining his place in public\r\nconsideration by his numerous writings, he was personally widely known:\r\nhe was universally esteemed a man of strict veracity and integrity. He\r\nwrites thus of himself:—\r\n\r\n“If the reception of so many visiters was sometimes troublesome,\r\nit repaid itself occasionally either by making me acquainted with\r\nremarkable personages, or by bringing out a wonderful sort of\r\nseer-gift, which I called my inward vision, and which has always\r\nremained an enigma to me. I am almost afraid to say a word upon this\r\nsubject; not for fear of the imputation of being superstitious, but\r\nlest I should encourage that disposition in others; and yet it forms a\r\ncontribution to psychology. So to confess.\r\n\r\n“It is acknowledged that the judgment which we form of strangers, on\r\nfirst meeting them, is frequently more correct than that which we\r\nadopt upon a longer acquaintance with them. The first impression which,\r\nthrough an instinct of the soul, attracts one towards, or repels one\r\nfrom, another, becomes, after a time, more dim, and is weakened, either\r\nthrough his appearing other than at first, or through our becoming\r\naccustomed to him. People speak, too, in reference to such cases of\r\ninvoluntary sympathies and aversions, and attach a special certainty\r\nto such manifestations in children, in whom knowledge of mankind by\r\nexperience is wanting. Others, again, are incredulous, and attribute\r\nall to physiognomical skill. But of myself.\r\n\r\n“It has happened to me occasionally, at the first meeting with a total\r\nstranger, when I have been listening in silence to his conversation,\r\nthat his past life, up to the present moment, with many minute\r\ncircumstances belonging to one or other particular scene in it, has\r\ncome across me like a dream, but distinctly, entirely, involuntarily,\r\nand unsought, occupying in duration a few minutes. During this period I\r\nam usually so plunged into the representation of the stranger’s life,\r\nthat at last I neither continue to see distinctly his face, on which\r\nI was idly speculating, nor to hear intelligently his voice, which at\r\nfirst I was using as a commentary to the text of his physiognomy. For\r\na long time I was disposed to consider these fleeting visions as a\r\ntrick of the fancy; the more so that my dream-vision displayed to me\r\nthe dress and movements of the actors, the appearance of the room, the\r\nfurniture, and other accidents of the scene; till, on one occasion,\r\nin a gamesome mood, I narrated to my family the secret history of a\r\nsempstress who had just before quitted the room. I had never seen the\r\nperson before. Nevertheless the hearers were astonished, and laughed,\r\nand would not be persuaded but that I had a previous acquaintance\r\nwith the former life of the person, inasmuch as what I had stated was\r\nperfectly true. I was not less astonished to find that my dream-vision\r\nagreed with reality. I then gave more attention to the subject, and, as\r\noften as propriety allowed of it, I related to those whose lives had so\r\npassed before me the substance of my dream-vision, to obtain from them\r\nits contradiction or confirmation. On every occasion its confirmation\r\nfollowed, not without amazement on the part of those who gave it.\r\n\r\n“Least of all could I myself give faith to these conjuring tricks of my\r\nmind. Every time that I described to any one my dream-vision respecting\r\nhim, I confidently expected him to answer it was not so. A secret\r\nthrill always came over me when the listener replied, ‘It happened as\r\nyou say;’ or when, before he spoke, his astonishment betrayed that I\r\nwas not wrong. Instead of recording many instances, I will give one\r\nwhich, at the time, made a strong impression upon me.\r\n\r\n“On a fair day, I went into the town of Waldshut, accompanied by two\r\nyoung foresters who are still alive. It was evening, and, tired with\r\nour walk, we went into an inn called the Vine. We took our supper with\r\na numerous company at the public table; when it happened that they made\r\nthemselves merry over the peculiarities and simplicity of the Swiss,\r\nin connexion with the belief in Mesmerism, Lavater’s physiognomical\r\nsystem, and the like. One of my companions, whose national pride was\r\ntouched by their raillery, begged me to make some reply, particularly\r\nin answer to a young man of superior appearance, who sat opposite, and\r\nhad indulged in unrestrained ridicule. It happened that the events of\r\nthis very person’s life had just previously passed before my mind.\r\nI turned to him with the question, whether he would reply to me with\r\ntruth and candour, if I narrated to him the most secret passages of\r\nhis history, he being as little known to me as I to him? That would,\r\nI suggested, go something beyond Lavater’s physiognomical skill. He\r\npromised, if I told the truth, to admit it openly. Then I narrated\r\nthe events with which my dream-vision had furnished me, and the table\r\nlearnt the history of the young tradesman’s life, of his school years,\r\nhis peccadilloes, and, finally, of a little act of roguery committed by\r\nhim on the strong box of his employer. I described the uninhabited room\r\nwith its white walls, where, to the right of the brown door, there had\r\nstood upon the table the small black money-chest, &c. A dead silence\r\nreigned in the company during this recital, interrupted only when I\r\noccasionally asked if I spoke the truth. The man, much struck, admitted\r\nthe correctness of each circumstance—even, which I could not expect, of\r\nthe last. Touched with his frankness, I reached my hand to him across\r\nthe table, and closed my narrative. He asked my name, which I gave him.\r\nWe sat up late in the night conversing. He may be alive yet.\r\n\r\n“Now I can well imagine how a lively imagination could picture,\r\nromance-fashion, from the obvious character of a person, how he would\r\nconduct himself under given circumstances. But whence came to me the\r\ninvoluntary knowledge of accessory details, which were without any sort\r\nof interest, and respected people who for the most part were utterly\r\nindifferent to me, with whom I neither had, nor wished to have, the\r\nslightest association? Or was it in each case mere coincidence? Or had\r\nthe listener, to whom I described his history, each time other images\r\nin his mind than the accessory ones of my story, but, in surprise at\r\nthe essential resemblance of my story to the truth, lost sight of the\r\npoints of difference? Yet I have, in consideration of this possible\r\nsource of error, several times taken pains to describe the most trivial\r\ncircumstances that my dream-vision has shown me.\r\n\r\n“Not another word about this strange seer-gift, which I can aver was of\r\nno use to me in a single instance, which manifested itself occasionally\r\nonly, and quite independently of any volition, and often in relation\r\nto persons in whose history I took not the slightest interest. Nor\r\nam I the only one in possession of this faculty. In a journey with\r\ntwo of my sons, I fell in with an old Tyrolese who travelled about,\r\nselling lemons and oranges, at the inn at Unterhauerstein in one of\r\nthe Jura passes. He fixed his eyes for some time upon me, joined in\r\nour conversation, observed that though I did not know him he knew me,\r\nand began to describe my acts and deeds, to the no little amusement of\r\nthe peasants, and astonishment of my children, whom it interested to\r\nlearn that another possessed the same gift as their father. How the\r\nold lemon-merchant acquired his knowledge he was not able to explain\r\nto himself nor to me. But he seemed to attach great importance to his\r\nhidden wisdom.”[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Zschokke told a friend of mine at Frankfort, in 1847,\r\nshortly before his death, which took place at an advanced age, that in\r\nthe latter years of his life his seer-gift had never manifested itself.]\r\n\r\nIn the newness of such knowledge, it is worth while to note separately\r\neach of the particulars which attended the manifestation of this\r\nstrange mental faculty, with his account of which Zschokke has enriched\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\n1. Then, after the power of looking up the entire recollections\r\nof another, through some other channel than ordinary inquiry and\r\nobservation—and as it seemed _directly_—we may note,—\r\n\r\n2. The rapidity, minuteness, and precision, which characterized the act\r\nof inspection.\r\n\r\n3. The feeling attending it of becoming absent or lost to what was\r\ngoing on around.\r\n\r\n4. Its involuntariness and unexpectedness.\r\n\r\n5. Its being practicable on some only; and\r\n\r\n6. Those entire strangers, and at their first interview with the seer.\r\n\r\nAt present I shall avail myself of the first broad fact alone,\r\nremarking, however, of the conditions observed in it, that they clearly\r\nindicate the existence of a law on which the phenomenon depended. And\r\nI shall assume it to be proved by the above crucial instance, that the\r\nmind, or soul, of one human being can be brought, in the natural course\r\nof things, and under physiological laws hereafter to be determined,\r\ninto immediate relation with the mind of another living person.\r\n\r\nIf this principle be admitted, it is adequate to explain all the\r\npuzzling phenomena of real ghosts and of true dreams. For example, the\r\nghostly and intersomnial communications, with which we have as yet\r\ndealt, have been announcements of the deaths of absent parties. Suppose\r\nour new principle brought into play; the soul of the dying person is\r\nto be supposed to have come into direct communication with the mind of\r\nhis friend, with the effect of suggesting his present condition. If the\r\nseer be dreaming, the suggestion shapes a corresponding dream; if he\r\nbe awake, it originates a sensorial illusion. To speak figuratively,\r\n_merely figuratively_, in reference to the circulation of this partial\r\nmental obituary, I will suppose that the death of a human being\r\nthrows a sort of gleam through the spiritual world, which may now\r\nand then touch with light some fittingly disposed object; or even two\r\nsimultaneously, if chance have placed them in the right relation;—as\r\nthe twin-spires of a cathedral may be momentarily illuminated by some\r\nfar-off flash, which does not break the gloom upon the roofs below.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is applicable to the explanation of the vampyr\r\nvisit. The soul of the buried man is to be supposed to be brought into\r\ncommunication with his friend’s mind. Thence follows, as a sensorial\r\nillusion, the apparition of the buried man. Perhaps the visit may\r\nhave been an instinctive effort to draw the attention of his friend\r\nto his living grave. I beg to suggest that it would not be an act of\r\nsuperstition _now_, but of ordinary humane precaution, if one dreamed\r\npertinaciously of a recently buried acquaintance, or saw his ghost, to\r\ntake immediate steps to have the state of the body ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, in the present letter, to push the application\r\nof this principle further. With slight modifications it might be\r\nbrought to explain several other wonderful stories, which we usually\r\nneglect just from not seeing how to explain them. One class of these\r\ninstances is what was termed second-sight. The belief in it formerly\r\nprevailed in Scotland, and in the whole of the north of Europe. But the\r\nfaculty, if it ever existed, seems to be disappearing now. However,\r\nit is difficult, one has heard so many examples of the correctness of\r\nits warnings and anticipations, not to believe that it once really\r\nmanifested itself.\r\n\r\nA much respected Scottish lady, not unknown in literature, told me very\r\nrecently how a friend of her mother, whom she perfectly remembered,\r\nhad been compelled to believe in second-sight through its occurrence\r\nin one of her servants. She had a cook, who was a continual annoyance\r\nto her through her possession of this gift. On one occasion, when\r\nthe lady expected some friends, she learned, a short time before\r\nthey were to arrive, that the culinary preparations she had ordered\r\nto honour them had not been made. Upon her remonstrating with the\r\noffending cook, the latter simply but doggedly assured her that come\r\nthey would not; that she knew it to a certainty; and, true enough,\r\nthey did not come. Some accident had occurred to prevent their visit.\r\nThe same person frequently knew beforehand what her mistress’s plans\r\nwere, and was as inconvenient in her kitchen as a calculating prodigy\r\nin a counting-house. Things went perfectly right, but the manner was\r\nirregular and provoking; so her mistress turned her away. Supposing\r\nthis story true, the phenomena look just a modification of Zschokke’s\r\nseer-gift.\r\n\r\nA number of incidents there are turning up, for the most part on\r\ntrivial occasions, which we put aside for fear of being thought\r\nsuperstitious, because as yet a natural solution is not at hand for\r\nthem. Sympathy in general, the spread of panic fears, the simultaneous\r\noccurrence of the same thoughts to two persons, the intuitive knowledge\r\nof mankind possessed by some, the magnetic fascination of others,\r\nmay eventually be found to have to do with a special and unsuspected\r\ncause. Among anecdotes of no great conclusiveness that I have heard\r\nnarrated of this sort, I will cite two of Lord Nelson, told by the\r\nlate Sir Thomas Hardy to the late Admiral the Hon. G. Dundas, from\r\nwhom I heard them. The first was mentioned to exemplify Nelson’s\r\nquick insight into character. Captain Hardy was present as Nelson\r\ngave directions to the commander of a frigate to make sail with all\r\nspeed—to proceed to certain points, where he was likely to fall in with\r\nthe French fleet—having seen the French, to go to a certain harbour,\r\nand there await Lord Nelson’s coming. After the commander had left the\r\ncabin, Nelson said to Hardy, “He will go to the West Indies, he will\r\nsee the French; he will go to the harbour I have directed him to; but\r\nhe will not wait for me—he will sail for England.” The commander did\r\nso. Shortly before the battle of Trafalgar an English frigate was in\r\nadvance, looking out for the enemy; her place in the offing was hardly\r\ndiscernible. Of a sudden Nelson said to Hardy, who was at his side,\r\n“The Celeste,” (or whatever the frigate’s name was,) “the Celeste\r\nsees the French.” Hardy had nothing to say on the matter. “She sees\r\nthe French; she’ll fire a gun.” Within a little time, the boom of the\r\nsignal-gun was heard.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The following anecdote has no conceivable right to be\r\nintroduced on the present occasion; but I had it on the same authority,\r\nand it is a pity it should be lost. As our fleet was bearing down upon\r\nthe enemies’ line at Trafalgar, Nelson paced the quarter-deck of the\r\nVictory with Sir Thomas Hardy. After a short silence, touching his left\r\nthigh with his remaining hand, Nelson said, “I’d give that, Hardy, to\r\ncome out of this.”]\r\n\r\nI am not sure that my new principle will be a general favourite. It\r\nwill be said that the cases, in which I suppose it manifested, are\r\nof too trivial a nature to justify so novel a hypothesis. My answer\r\nis, the cases are few and trivial only because the subject has not\r\nbeen attended to. For how many centuries were the laws of electricity\r\npreindicated by the single fact that a piece of amber, when rubbed,\r\nwould attract light bodies! Again, the school of physiological\r\nmaterialists will of course be opposed to it. They hold that the mind\r\nis but a function or product of the brain, and cannot therefore\r\nconsistently admit its separate action. But their fundamental tenet is\r\nunsound, even upon considering the analogies of matter alone.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by a product?—in what does production consist? Let\r\nus look for instances: a metal is produced from an ore; alcohol is\r\nproduced from saccharine matter; the bones and sinews of an animal are\r\nproduced from its food. Production, in the common signification of the\r\nword, means the conversion of one substance into another, weight for\r\nweight, agreeably with, or under, mechanical, chemical, and vital laws.\r\nI speak, of course, of material production. But the case of thought\r\nis parallel. The products of the poet’s brain are but recombinations\r\nof former ideas. Production, with him, is but a rearrangement of the\r\nelements of thought. His food may turn into or produce new brain;\r\nbut it is the mental impressions he has stored which turn into new\r\nimagery. To say that the brain turns into thought, is to assert that\r\nconsciousness and the brain are one and the same thing, which would be\r\nan idle abuse of language.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed true that, with the manifestation of each thought or\r\nfeeling, a corresponding decomposition of the brain takes place. But\r\nit is equally true that, in a voltaic battery in action, each movement\r\nof electric force developed there is attended with a waste of the\r\nmetal-plates which help to form it. But that waste is not converted\r\ninto electric fluid. The exact quantity of pure zinc which disappears\r\nmay be detected in the form of sulphate of zinc. The electricity\r\nwas _not produced, it was only set in motion_, by the chemical\r\ndecomposition. Here is the true material analogy of the relation of\r\nthe brain to the mind. Mind, like electricity, is an imponderable\r\nforce pervading the universe: and there happen to be known to us\r\ncertain material arrangements, through which each may be influenced. We\r\ncannot, indeed, pursue the analogy beyond this step. Consciousness and\r\nelectricity have nothing further in common. Their further relations to\r\nthe dissimilar material arrangements, through which they may be excited\r\nor disturbed, are subjects of totally distinct studies, and resolvable\r\ninto laws which have no affinity, and admit of no comparison.\r\n\r\nIt is singular how early in the history of mankind the belief in the\r\nseparate existence of the soul developed itself as an instinct of our\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nTimarchus, who was curious on the subject of the demon of Socrates,\r\nwent to the cave of Trophonius to consult the oracle about it. There,\r\nhaving for a short time inhaled the mephitic vapour, he felt as if he\r\nhad received a sudden blow on the head, and sank down insensible. Then\r\nhis head appeared to him to open, and to give issue to his soul into\r\nthe other world; and an imaginary being seemed to inform him that “the\r\npart of the soul engaged in the body, entrammelled in its organization,\r\nis the soul as ordinarily understood; but that there is another part\r\nor province of the soul which is the daimon. This has a certain\r\ncontrol over the bodily soul, and among other offices constitutes\r\nconscience.”—“In three months,” the vision added, “you will know more\r\nof this.” At the end of three months Timarchus died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n TRANCE.—Distinction of esoneural and exoneural mental\r\n phenomena—Abnormal relation of the mind and nervous system\r\n possible—Insanity—Sleep—Essential nature of Trance—Its alliance with\r\n spasmodic seizures—General characters of Trance—Enumeration of its\r\n kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has now arrived for expounding the phenomena of Trance; an\r\nacquaintance with which is necessary to enable you to understand the\r\nsource and nature of the delusions with which I have yet to deal.\r\n\r\nYou have already had glimpses of this condition. Arnod Paole was in a\r\ntrance in the cemetery of Meduegna—Timarchus was in a trance in the\r\ncave of Trophonius.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by developing certain preliminary conceptions relating to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nI. Common observation, the spontaneous course of our reflections, our\r\ninstinctive interpretation of nature, reveal to us matter, motion,\r\nand intelligence, as the co-existing phenomena of the universe. In\r\nthe farthest distances of space cognisable to our senses, we discern\r\nmatter and motion, and their subordination to intelligence. Upon the\r\nearth’s surface we discern, in the finely designed mechanism of each\r\nplant, the agency of life; and we recognise in the microcosm of each\r\nanimal a living organization, fitted to be the recipient of individual\r\nconsciousness, or of personal being.\r\n\r\nII. The intelligence which is communicated to living beings becomes,\r\nto a great extent, dependent upon the organization with which it is\r\ncombined. Thus every mental faculty is found to have its definite seat\r\nand habitat in the bodily frame. The principal successes of modern\r\nphysiologists have been achieved in determining with what precise parts\r\nof the nervous system each affection of consciousness is functionally\r\nassociated. Different classes of nerves are found to be appropriated to\r\nsensation and volition; different parts of the spinal cord are proved\r\nto minister to different offices; and of the subdivisions of the brain,\r\neach is thought to correspond with a separate faculty, or sentiment,\r\nor appetite. So far the mental forces, or operations of a living human\r\nbeing, may be conceived to be essentially esoneural, (εσω νευζον.) Each\r\nappears to have its proper and special workshop or laboratory in the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nIII. But there are not wanting facts which make it reasonable to\r\nthink that our mental forces or operations transcend occasionally and\r\npartially the limits of our corporeal frame. The phenomena adverted\r\nto in the preceding letter, in connexion with the narrative of\r\nZschokke’s seer-gift, hardly seem to admit of explanation on any other\r\nsupposition. Nor is it a very improbable conjecture, that phenomena\r\nof the same class form, as it were, the complements of many ordinary\r\nesoneural operations. Possibly in common perception the mind directly\r\nreaches the object perceived, being excited thereto by the antecedent\r\nmaterial impressions on our organs, and the sensations which follow. To\r\ndenote mental phenomena of the kind I am supposing, I propose the term\r\nexoneural, (εξω νευζον.) I venture even, following out this idea, to\r\nconjecture further, that the Od force may somehow furnish the dynamic\r\nbridge along which our exoneural apprehension travels.\r\n\r\nIV. The affections of consciousness would thus be in part esoneural,\r\nin part exoneural, during the healthy and normal state of our being;\r\nthe esoneural part being executed in immediate connexion with its\r\nappropriate organ, and every manifestation of it being attended with a\r\nphysical change in the latter.\r\n\r\nV. But it is conceivable, on the assumption of mind being a separate\r\nprinciple from matter, that the human soul may be capable of retaining\r\nits union with the body in a new, unusual, and abnormal relation. The\r\nhypothesis is startling enough. I adopt it only from seeing no other\r\nway of accounting for certain facts which, with the evidence of their\r\nreality, will presently be brought forward. I venture to suppose\r\nthat the mind of a living man may energize abnormally in two ways:\r\nfirst, that a much larger share of its operations may be conducted\r\nexoneurally—that is, out of the body—than usual; secondly, that\r\nthe esoneural mental functions may be conducted within the body in\r\nunaccustomed organs, deserting those naturally appropriated to them.\r\nTwo or three instances have been already given, which favour, at all\r\nevents, the supposition of the possibility of such an abnormal relation\r\nbetween the mind and the body being realized. But in most of the\r\ninstances hitherto adverted to, the normal relation may be supposed to\r\nhave remained.\r\n\r\nVI. Thus all the ordinary phenomena of sensorial illusions at once are\r\nesoneural, and suppose the persistence of the normal relation of mind\r\nand body. The material organ to which the physical agencies preceding\r\nsensation are propagated being irritated, is to be supposed to excite\r\nin the mind sensuous recollections or fancies that are so vivid as to\r\nappear realities.\r\n\r\nVII. In mental delusions, again, there is no reason for surmising\r\nthe intervention of the abnormal relation. But what are mental\r\ndelusions? They are a part of insanity. And what is insanity? I will\r\nsummarily state its features; for some of the instances which remain\r\nfor explanation are referrible to it, and because I delight to crush a\r\nvolume into a paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of insanity may be arranged under five heads: The first,\r\nthe insane temperament; the next three the fundamental forms of mental\r\nderangement; the fifth, the paroxysmal state. The features of the\r\ninsane temperament are various; some of them are incompatible with the\r\nsimultaneous presence of others. When a group of them is present, as a\r\nchange in natural character, without insanity, insanity is threatened:\r\nno form of insanity manifests itself without the presence of some of\r\nthem. The features of the insane temperament are these: The patient\r\nwithdraws his sympathies from those around him, is shy, reserved,\r\ncunning, suspicious, with a troubled air, as if he felt something to\r\nbe wrong, and wonders if you see it; he is capricious, and has flaws\r\nof temper; being talkative, he is flighty and extravagant; he is\r\nhurried in his thoughts, and mode of speaking, and gestures; he has\r\nfits of absence, in which he talks aloud to himself; he is restless,\r\nand anxious for change of place. Of the elementary forms of insanity,\r\none consists in the entertainment of mental delusions: the patient\r\nimagines himself the Deity, or a prophet, or a monarch, or that he\r\nhas become enormously wealthy; or that he is possessed by the devil,\r\nor is persecuted by invisible beings, or is dead, or very poor, or\r\nthat he is the victim of public or private injustice. The second form\r\nis moral perversion: the patient is depressed in spirits without a\r\ncause, perhaps to the extent of meditating suicide; or he feels an\r\nunaccountable desire to take the lives of others; or he is impelled\r\nto steal, or to do gratuitous mischief; or he is a sot; or he has fits\r\nof ungovernable and dangerous rage. The third form exhibits itself\r\nin loss of connexion of ideas, failure of memory, loss of common\r\nintelligence, disregard of the common decencies of life. Each of these\r\nthree elementary forms is sometimes met with alone; generally two\r\nare combined. Sensorial illusions are common in insanity; auditory,\r\nunaccompanied by visual illusions, are almost peculiar to it, and to\r\nthe cognate affection of delirium from fever or inflammation of the\r\nbrain. To the head of the paroxysmal state belongs the history of\r\nexacerbations of insanity, of their sudden outbursts in persons of the\r\ninsane temperament, of their preferential connexion with this or that\r\nantecedent condition of the patient, of their occasional periodicity.\r\n\r\nVII. In congenital idiotcy and imbecility, the relation of the mind and\r\nbrain is normal. Often the defective organization is apparent through\r\nwhich the intelligence is repressed. In many countries a popular\r\nbelief prevails that the imbecile have occasional glimpses of higher\r\nknowledge. There is no reason evident why their minds should not be\r\nsusceptible of the abnormal relation.\r\n\r\nVIII. In sleep, the mind and brain are in the normal relation. But what\r\nis sleep, psychically considered?\r\n\r\nIt is best to begin by looking into the mental constituents of waking.\r\nThere is then passing before us an endless current of images and\r\nreflections, furnished from our recollections, and suggested by our\r\nhopes and our fears, by pursuits that interest us, or by their own\r\ninter-associations. This current of thought is continually being\r\nchanged or modified, through impressions made upon our senses. It is\r\nfurther liable to be still more importantly and systematically modified\r\nby the exercise of the faculty of Attention. The attention operates\r\nin a twofold manner. It enables us to detain at pleasure any subject\r\nof thought before the mind; and, when not on such urgent duty, it\r\nvigilantly inspects every idea which presents itself, and reports if\r\nit be palpably unsound or of questionable tendency. To speak with more\r\nprecision, it is a power we have of controlling our thoughts, which\r\nwe drill to warn us whenever the suggested ideas conflict with our\r\nexperience or our principles.\r\n\r\nThen of sleep. We catch glimpses of its nature at the moments of\r\nfalling asleep and of waking. When it is the usual time for sleep,\r\nif our attention happen to be livelily excited, it is in vain we\r\ncourt sleep. When we are striving to contend against the sense of\r\noverwhelming fatigue, what we feel is, that we can no longer command\r\nour attention. Then we are lost, or are asleep. Then the head and body\r\ndrop forwards; we have ceased to attend to the maintenance of our\r\nequilibrium. Any iteration of gentle, impressions, enough to divert\r\nattention from other objects, without arousing it, promotes sleep.\r\n\r\nThus we recognise as the psychical basis of sleep the suspension of the\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAre any other mental faculties suspended in sleep? Sensation and the\r\ninfluence of the will over the muscular system are not; for our dreams\r\nare liable to be shaped by what we hear. The sleeper, without waking,\r\nwill turn his head away from a bright light, will withdraw his arm if\r\nyou pinch it, will utter loud words which he dreams he is employing.\r\nThe seeming insensibility in sleep, the apparent suspension of the\r\ninfluence of the will, are simply consequences of the suspension of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI have, on another occasion, shown that the organs in which\r\nsensations are realized, and volition energizes, are the segments of\r\nthe cranio-spinal cord in which the sentient and voluntary nerves\r\nare rooted. I think I see now that the seat of the attention is the\r\n“medulla oblongata.” For—alas for the imperfect conceptions into\r\nwhich the imperfection of language as an instrument of thought forces\r\nus!—what is the faculty of attention, which we have been considering\r\nalmost as a separate element of mind, but the individual “ich”\r\nenergizing, now keenly noticing impressions and thoughts, now allowing\r\nthem to pass, while it looks on with lazy indifference; now, at length,\r\nworn out and exhausted, and incapable of further work? But this\r\ninspecting and contrasting operation, where should it more naturally\r\nfind its bureau than at a point situated between the organs of the\r\nunderstanding and those of the will?—that is to say, somewhere at the\r\njunction of the spinal marrow and the brain. Well, Magendie ascertained\r\nthat just at that region there is a small portion of nervous matter,\r\npressure upon which causes immediately heavy sleep or stupor, while\r\nits destruction—_for instance, the laceration of the little organ with\r\nthe point of a needle_—instantaneously and irrevocably extinguishes\r\nlife.[4] This precious link in our system is, reasonably enough, stowed\r\naway in the securest part of our frame—that is to say, within the\r\nhead, upon the strong central bone of the base of the skull. How came\r\nthe fancy of Shakspeare by the happy figure which seems to adumbrate\r\nMagendie’s discovery of to-day, in poetry written three hundred years\r\nago?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The reader who wishes to pursue this subject farther, will\r\nfind it expounded, in connexion with a large body of collateral facts,\r\nin my work entitled _The Nervous System and its Functions_. Parker,\r\nWest Strand: 1842.]\r\n\r\n                “Within the hollow crown,\r\n    That rounds the mortal temples of a king,\r\n    Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits\r\n    Mocking his state, and grinning at his pomp;\r\n    Allowing him a breath, a little hour,\r\n    To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks;\r\n    Infusing him with self and vain conceits,\r\n    As if the flesh that walls about our life\r\n    Were brass impregnable. Till, humoured thus,\r\n    He comes at last, and, with a little pin,\r\n    Bores through his castle wall—and farewell king!”\r\n\r\nTo return to our argument, Are the sentiments and higher faculties of\r\nthe mind suspended during sleep? Certainly not, if dreaming be a part\r\nof natural sleep, as I hold it to be. For there are some who dream\r\nalways; others, who say they seldom dream; others, who disavow dreaming\r\nat all. But the simplest view of these three cases is to suppose that\r\nin sleep all persons always dream, but that all do not remember their\r\ndreams. This imputed forgetfulness is not surprising, considering the\r\nimportance of the attention to memory, and that in sleep the attention\r\nis suspended. Ordinary dreams present one remarkable feature; nothing\r\nin them appears wonderful. We meet and converse with friends long dead;\r\nthe improbability of the event never crosses our minds. One sees a\r\nhorse galloping by, and calls after it as one’s friend—Mr. so-and-so.\r\nWe fly with agreeable facility, and explain to an admiring circle how\r\nwe manage it. Every absurdity passes unchallenged. The attention is off\r\nduty. It is important to remark that there is nothing in common dreams\r\nto interfere with the purpose of sleep, which is repose. The cares and\r\ninterests of our waking life never recur to us; or, if they do, are not\r\nrecognised as our own. The faculties are not really energizing; their\r\nseeming exercise is sport; they are unharnessed, and are gambolling and\r\nrolling in idle relaxation. That is their refreshment.\r\n\r\nThe attention alone slumbers; or, through some slight organic change,\r\nit is unlinked from the other faculties, and they are put out of gear.\r\nThis is the basis of sleep. The faculties are all in their places; but\r\nthe attention is off duty; itself asleep, or indolently keeping watch\r\nof time alone.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this picture of the sleeping and waking states, of the\r\nalternation of which our mental life consists, I have now to hold up to\r\nview another conception, resembling it, but different, vague, imposing,\r\nof gigantic proportions, the monstrous double of the first—like the\r\nmocking spectre of the Hartz, which yet is but your own shadow cast by\r\nthe level sunbeams on the morning mist.\r\n\r\nTo answer to this conception, there is more than the ideal entity made\r\nup of the different forms of trance. For although trance may occur as\r\na single sleep-like fit of moderate duration, yet it more frequently\r\nrecurs—often periodically, dividing the night or day with common sleep\r\nor common waking; or it may be persistent for days and weeks—in which\r\ncase, if it generally maintain one character, it is yet liable to have\r\nwakings of its own.\r\n\r\nThen the first division of trance is into trance-sleep and\r\ntrance-waking. In extreme cases it is easy to tell trance-sleep from\r\ncommon sleep, trance-waking from common waking; but there are varieties\r\nwith less prominent features, in which it is difficult, at first, to\r\nsay whether the patient is entranced at all.\r\n\r\nThere is, upon the whole, more alliance between sleep and trance, than\r\nbetween waking and trance. Or, in a large class of cases, the patient\r\nfalls into trance when asleep. It is a cognate phenomenon to this that\r\nthe common initiatory stage of trance is a trance-sleep.\r\n\r\nTrance is of more frequent occurrence among the young than among the\r\nmiddle-aged or old people. It occurs more frequently among young\r\nwomen than among young men. In other words, the liability to trance\r\nis in proportion to delicacy of organization, and higher nervous\r\nsusceptibility.\r\n\r\nBut what is trance? The question will be best answered by exhibiting\r\nits several phases. In the mean time, it may be laid down that the\r\nbasis of trance is the supervention of the abnormal relation of the\r\nmind and nervous system. In almost all its forms it is easy to show\r\nthat some of the mental functions are no longer located in their\r\npristine organs. The most ordinary change is the departure of common\r\nsensation from the organ of touch. Next, sight leaves the organs of\r\nvision. To make up for these desertions, if the patient wake in trance,\r\neither the same senses reappear elsewhere, or some unaccountable mode\r\nof general perception manifests itself.\r\n\r\nA strict alliance exists between trance and the whole family of spasms.\r\nMost of them are exclusively developed in connexion with it; all are\r\nliable to be combined with it; they are all capable of being excited\r\nby the same influences which produce trance; so they often occur\r\nvicariously, or alternate with trance. One kind is catalepsy; the\r\nbody motionless, statue-like, but the tone of spasm maintained low,\r\nso that you may arrange the statue in what attitude you will, and it\r\npreserves it. A second is catochus, like the preceding, but with a\r\nhigher power of spasm, so that the joints are rigidly fixed; and if\r\nyou overcome one for a moment with superior strength, being let go, it\r\nflies back to where it was. A third, partial spasm of equal rigidity,\r\narching the body forwards or backwards or laterally, or fixing one\r\nlimb or more. The fourth, clonic spasm, for instance, the contortions\r\nand convulsive struggles of epilepsy. The fifth, an impulse to rapid\r\nand varied muscular actions, nearly equalling convulsions in violence,\r\nbut combined so as to travesty ordinary voluntary motion; this is the\r\ndance of St. Veitz, which took its name from an epidemic outbreak\r\nin Germany in the thirteenth century, that was supposed to be cured\r\nby the interposition of the saint; then persons of all classes were\r\nseized in groups in public with a fury of kicking, shuffling, dancing\r\ntogether, till they dropt. Now, the same agency is manifested either\r\nin a violent rush, and disposition to climb with inconceivable agility\r\nand precision; or alternately to twist the features, roll the neck, and\r\njerk and swing the limbs even to the extent of dislocating them.\r\n\r\nThe causes of trance are mostly mental. Trance appears to be\r\ncontagious. Viewed medically, it is seldom directly dangerous. It is\r\na product of over-excitability, which time blunts. The disposition to\r\ntrance is seldom manifested beyond a few months, or, at most, two or\r\nthree years. For epilepsy is not a form of trance; it is, however, a\r\nmixed mental and spasmodic seizure, much allied to trance. Those who\r\nsuffer from its attacks are found to be among the most susceptible of\r\ninduced trance.\r\n\r\nBut let me again ask, what then is trance?\r\n\r\nTrance is a peculiar mental seizure, (totally distinct from insanity,\r\nwith which again, however, it may be combined,) the patient taken with\r\nwhich appears profoundly absorbed or rapt, and as if lost more or less\r\ncompletely to surrounding objects or impressions, or at all events\r\nto the ordinary mode of perceiving them; he is likewise more or less\r\nentirely lost to his former recollections. The mental seizures may or\r\nmay not occur simultaneously or alternately with spasmodic seizures of\r\nany and every character.\r\n\r\nThis definition of trance conveys, I am afraid, no very exact or\r\ndistinct picture; but it is the definition of a genus, and a genus is\r\nnecessarily an abstraction. However, it gives the features essential to\r\nall the forms of trance. A true general notion of trance can, indeed,\r\nonly be realized by studying in detail each of the forms it includes.\r\nThese are separated by the broadest colours. In the one extreme an\r\nentranced person appears dead, and no sign of life is recognisable in\r\nhim; in the opposite, he appears to be much as usual, and perfectly\r\nimpressible by any thing around him, so that it demands careful\r\nobservation to establish that he is not simply awake.\r\n\r\nThen trance presents no fewer than five specific forms, distinguished\r\neach from the other by clear characters, their essential identity being\r\nestablished by each at times passing into either of the others. The\r\nterms by which I propose to designate the five primary forms of trance\r\nare—Death-trance, Trance-coma, Initiatory Trance, Half-waking-trance,\r\nWaking-trance. The five, however, admit, as I have before said,\r\nof being arranged in two groups: the first three forms enumerated\r\nconstituting varieties of trance-sleep; the two latter constituting\r\nvarieties of waking-trance. The next letter will treat of the first\r\ngroup; the two following will treat of the two varieties of the second.\r\n\r\nI have observed that the causes of trance are for the most part mental\r\nimpressions; but it will be found that certain physical influences\r\nmay produce the same results. The causes of trance, whether mental or\r\nphysical, deserve again to be regarded in three lights. Either they\r\nhave operated blindly and fortuitously, or they have been resorted to\r\nand used as agents to produce some vague and imperfectly understood\r\nresult, or they have been skilfully and intelligently directed to\r\nbring out the exact phenomena which have followed. It is with trance\r\nsupervening in the two former ways that I alone propose at present to\r\ndeal; that is to say, with trance as it was imperfectly known as an\r\nagent in superstition, or as a rare and marvellous form of nervous\r\ndisease. Of the third case of trance, as it may be artificially\r\ninduced, I shall afterwards and finally speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\n TRANCE-SLEEP—The phenomena of trance divided into those of\r\n trance-sleep, and those of trance-waking—Trance-sleep presents three\r\n forms; trance-waking two. The three forms of trance-sleep described:\r\n viz., death-trance, trance-coma, simple or initiatory trance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrance, then, it appears, is a peculiar mental seizure liable to\r\nsupervene in persons of an irritable nervous system, either after\r\nmental excitement or in deranged bodily health. The seizure may last\r\nfor a few hours, or a few days, or for weeks, or years; and is liable\r\nto recur at regular or irregular intervals.\r\n\r\nTrance again, it has been observed, has phases corresponding with the\r\nsleeping and waking of our natural state. And as natural sleep presents\r\nthree varieties—the profound and heavy sleep of extreme exhaustion,\r\nordinary deep sleep, and the light slumber of the wakeful and the\r\nanxious, so trance-sleep is three-fold likewise. But as in trance\r\nevery thing is magnified, the differences between the three states are\r\ngreater, and the phenomena of each more bold and striking.\r\n\r\nTwo conditions are common, however, to every phase of trance-sleep;\r\nthese are, the occurrence of complete insensibility, and that of vivid\r\nand coherent dreams.\r\n\r\nThe insensibility is so absolute that the most powerful stimulants\r\nare insufficient to rouse the patient. An electric shock, a surgical\r\noperation, the amputation even of a limb, are seemingly unfelt.\r\n\r\nThe dreams of trance-sleep have a character of their own. It is to be\r\nremarked, that in the dreams of ordinary sleep the ideas are commonly\r\nan incoherent jumble; and that, if they happen to refer to passing\r\nevents, they commonly reverse their features. The attention seems to\r\nbe slumbering. Thus Sir George Back told me, that in the privations\r\nwhich he encountered in Sir John Franklin’s first expedition, when\r\nin fact he was starving, he uniformly dreamed of plentiful repasts.\r\nBut in the dreams of trance-sleep, on the contrary, the impressions\r\nof the waking thoughts, the exciting ideas themselves, which have\r\ncaused the supervention of trance, are realized and carried out in a\r\nconsecutive train of imaginary action. They are, accordingly, upon the\r\npatient’s awaking, accurately remembered by him; and that with such\r\nforce and distinctness, that if he be a fanatic or superstitiously\r\ninclined, he very likely falls into the belief that the occurrences he\r\ndreamed of actually took place in his presence. A temperate fanatic\r\ngoes no further, under such circumstances, than to assert that he\r\nhas had a vision. The term is so good a one, that it appears to me\r\nworth retaining, in a philosophical sense, for the present exigency.\r\nI propose to restrict the term vision to the dreams of persons in\r\ntrance-sleep.\r\n\r\nThen of the three different forms of trance-sleep,\r\n\r\nI. _Death-trance._—Death-trance is the image of death. The heart\r\ndoes not act; the breathing is suspended; the body is motionless;\r\nnot the slightest outward sign of sensibility or consciousness can\r\nbe detected. The temperature of the body falls. The entranced person\r\nhas the appearance of a corpse from which life has recently departed.\r\nThe joints are commonly relaxed, and the whole frame pliable; but\r\nit is likely that spasmodic rigidity forms an occasional adjunct of\r\nthis strange condition. So the only means of knowing whether life be\r\nstill present is to wait the event. The body is to be kept in a warm\r\nroom, for the double purpose of promoting decomposition if it be dead,\r\nand of preserving in it the vital spark if it still linger; and it\r\nshould be constantly watched. But should every recently dead body be\r\nmade the subject of similar care? it is natural to ask. There are, of\r\ncourse, many cases where such care is positively unnecessary—such, for\r\ninstance, as death following great lesions of vital organs; and in\r\nthe great majority of cases of seeming death, the bare possibility of\r\nthe persistence of life hardly remains. Still it is better to err on\r\nthe safe side. And although in England, from the higher tone of moral\r\nfeeling, and from the respect shown to the remains of the dead, the\r\ndanger of being interred alive is inconsiderable, still the danger\r\ncertainly exists to a very considerable degree of being opened alive by\r\norder of a zealous coroner. But for the illustration of this danger,\r\nand examples of the circumstances under which death-trance has been\r\nknown to occur, and of its usual features, I refer the reader back to\r\nthe second Letter of this series. Let me, however, add, that it is not\r\nimprobable that, by means of persons susceptible of the influence of\r\nOd, or of persons in induced waking-trance, the question could be at\r\nonce decided whether a seeming corpse were really dead.\r\n\r\nIn England, during the last epidemic visitation of cholera, several\r\ncases of death-trance occurred, in which the patient, who was on\r\nthe point of being buried, fortunately awoke in time to be saved.\r\nDeath-trance, it is probable, is much more frequently produced by\r\nspasmodic and nervous illness than by mental causes: it has followed\r\nfever; it has frequently attended parturition. In this respect\r\nit differs from other forms of trance-sleep, which mostly, when\r\nspontaneous, supervene upon mental impressions.\r\n\r\nThe only feature of death-trance which it remains for me to exemplify\r\nis the occurrence in it of visions. Perhaps the following may be taken\r\nas an instance:—\r\n\r\nHenry Engelbrecht, as we learn in a pamphlet published by him in 1639,\r\nafter an ascetic life, during which he had experienced sensorial\r\nillusions, fell into the deepest form of trance, which he thus\r\ndescribes: In the year 1623, exhausted by intense mental excitement of\r\na religious kind, and by abstinence from food, after hearing a sermon\r\nwhich strongly affected him, he felt as if he could combat no longer;\r\nso he gave in and took to his bed. There he lay a week, without\r\ntasting any thing but the bread and wine of the sacrament. On the\r\neighth day, he thought he fell into the death-struggle. Death seemed\r\nto invade him from below upwards. His body became to his feelings\r\nrigid; his hands and feet insensible; his tongue and lips incapable of\r\nmotion; gradually his sight failed him. But he still heard the laments\r\nand consultations of those around him. This gradual demise lasted\r\nfrom mid-day till eleven at night, when he heard the watchmen. Then\r\nhe wholly lost sensibility to outward impressions. But an elaborate\r\nvision of immense detail began; the theme of which was, that he was\r\nfirst carried down to hell, and looked into the place of torment; from\r\nwhence, after a time, quicker than an arrow he was borne to Paradise.\r\nIn these abodes of suffering and happiness, he saw and heard and smelt\r\nthings unspeakable. These scenes, though long in apprehension, were\r\nshort in time; for he came enough to himself, by twelve o’clock, again\r\nto hear the watchmen. It took him another twelve hours to come round\r\nentirely. His hearing was first restored; then his sight; feeling and\r\npower of motion followed; as soon as he could move his limbs, he rose.\r\nHe felt himself stronger than before the trance.\r\n\r\nII. _Trance-coma._—The appearance of a person in trance-coma is that of\r\none in profound sleep. The breathing is regular, but extremely gentle;\r\nthe action of the heart the same; the frame lies completely relaxed and\r\nflexible, and, when raised, falls in any posture, like the body of one\r\njust dead, as its weight determines. The bodily temperature is natural.\r\nThe condition is distinguishable from common sleep by the total\r\ninsensibility of the entranced person to all ordinary stimulants:\r\nbesides, the pupil of the eye, instead of being contracted to a minute\r\naperture, as it is in common sleep, is usually dilated; at all events\r\nit is not contracted, and it is fixed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest cause of trance-coma is hysteria; or by hysteria\r\nis meant a highly irritable state of the nervous system, most commonly\r\nmet with in young unmarried women. There seems to be present, as its\r\nproximate cause, an excessive nervous vitality; and that excess, in\r\nits simplest manifestation, breaks out in fits of sobbing and crying,\r\nalternating often with laughter—a physical excitement of the system\r\nwhich yet fatigues and distresses the patient’s mind, who cannot resist\r\nthe unaccountable impulses. It is at the close of such a paroxysm of\r\nhysteria that trance-coma of a few hours’ duration not unfrequently\r\nsupervenes. It is almost a natural repose after the preceding stage\r\nof excitement. Hysteria, besides giving origin to a peculiar class of\r\nlocal ailments, is further the fruitful mother of most varieties of\r\ntrance.\r\n\r\nTrance-coma sometimes supervenes on fever, and the patient lies for\r\nhours or days on the seeming verge of death. I have known it ensue\r\nafter mesmeric practice carried to an imprudent excess. Religious\r\nmental excitement will bring it on. In the following instance,\r\nwhich I quote from the Rev. George Sandby’s sensible and useful\r\nwork on Mesmerism, the state of trance so supervening was probably\r\ntrance-coma: “George Fox, the celebrated father of Quakerism, at one\r\nperiod lay in a trance for fourteen days, and people came to stare and\r\nwonder at him. He had the appearance of a dead man; but his sleep was\r\nfull of divine visions of beauty and glory.”\r\n\r\nHere is another instance, wherein the prevailing state must have been\r\ntrance-coma. I quote it from the letter of an intelligent friend. It\r\nwill help the reader to realize the general conception I wish to raise\r\nin his mind:—\r\n\r\n“I heard,” says my correspondent, “through the newspapers, of a\r\ncase of trance ten miles from this place, and immediately rode to\r\nthe village to verify it, and gain information about it. With some\r\ndifficulty I persuaded the mother to allow me to see the entranced\r\ngirl. Her name is Ann Cromer; she is daughter of a mason at Faringdon\r\nGournay, ten miles from Bristol. She was lying in a state of general\r\nbut not total suspension of the symptoms of life. Her breathing was\r\nperceptible by the heaving of the chest, and at times she had uttered\r\nlow groans. Her jaws are locked, and she is incapable of the slightest\r\nmovement, so as to create no other wrinkle in her bed-clothes but such\r\nas a dead weight would produce. When I saw her, she had not been moved\r\nfor a week. Upon one occasion, when asked to show, by the pressure\r\nof the hand, if she felt any pain, a slight squeeze was perceptible.\r\nA very small portion of fluid is administered as food from time to\r\ntime, but I neglected to discover how. Her hands are warm, and her\r\nmother thinks that she is conscious. Three days before I saw her, she\r\nspoke (incoherently) for the first time since her trance commenced.\r\nShe repeated the Lord’s prayer, and asked for an aunt; but she rapidly\r\nrelapsed, and her locked-jaw returned. Her mother considered this\r\nrevival a sign of approaching death. The most remarkable feature in\r\nthe case is the length of time that the girl has remained entranced.\r\nShe was twelve years old when the fit supervened, and the locked-jaw\r\nfollowed in sixteen weeks afterwards. She is now twenty-five years of\r\nage, and will thus, in a month, if alive, have been in this condition\r\nfor thirteen years. In the mean while she has grown from a child to a\r\nwoman, though her countenance retains all the appearance of her former\r\nage. She is little else than skin and bone, except her cheeks, which\r\nare puffy. She is as pale as a corpse, and her eyes are sunk deep in\r\nthe sockets.”\r\n\r\nIII. _Simple or Initiatory Trance._—In the lightest form of\r\ntrance-sleep, the patient, though perfectly insensible to ordinary\r\nimpressions, is not necessarily recumbent. If he is sitting when\r\ntaken, he continues sitting; if previously lying, he will sometimes\r\nraise himself up when entranced. His joints are neither relaxed\r\nnor rigid: if you raise his arm, or bend the elbow, you experience\r\na little resistance; and immediately after, probably, the limb is\r\nrestored to its former posture. Such is the ordinary degree of muscular\r\ntone present; but either cataleptic immobility, or catochus, may\r\naccidentally co-exist with initiatory trance. The patient may even\r\nremain standing rapt in his trance. I quote the following classic\r\ninstance from the _Edinburgh Review_:—“There is a wonderful story told\r\nof Socrates. Being in military service in the expedition to Potidea, he\r\nis reported to have stood for twenty-four hours before the camp, rooted\r\nto the same spot and absorbed in deep thought, his arms folded and his\r\neyes fixed upon one object, as if his soul were absent from his body.”\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to dwell more on this form of trance at\r\npresent. Various cases, exemplifying its varieties, will be found\r\nin the letter on Religious Delusions. It is the commonest product\r\nof fanatical excitement. I have called this form initiatory trance,\r\nbecause, in day-somnambulism, it always precedes the half-waking\r\nwhich constitutes that state; and because it is the state into which\r\nmesmeric manipulators ordinarily first plunge the patient. Out of this\r\ninitiatory state I have seen the patient thrown into trance-coma; but\r\nthe ordinary progress of the experiment is to conduct him in the other\r\ndirection—that is, towards trance-waking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n HALF-WAKING TRANCE OR SOMNAMBULISM.—The same thing with ordinary\r\n sleep-walking—Its characteristic feature, the acting of a dream—Cases,\r\n and disquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious fate somnambulism has had. While other forms of trance\r\nhave been either rejected as fictions, or converted to the use of\r\nsuperstition, somnambulism with all its wonders, being at once\r\nundeniable and familiar, has been simply taken for granted. While her\r\nsisters have been exalted into mystical phenomena, and play parts in\r\nhistory, somnambulism has had no temple raised to her, has had no\r\nfear-worship, at the highest has been promoted to figure in an opera.\r\nOf a quiet and homely nature, she has moved about the house, not like a\r\nvisiting demon, but as a maid of all work. To the public the phenomenon\r\nhas presented no more interest than a soap-bubble, or the fall of an\r\napple.\r\n\r\nSomnambulism, as the term is used in England, exactly comprehends all\r\nthe phenomena of half-waking trance.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Many writers employ the term somnambulism to denote\r\nindiscriminately several forms of trance, or trance in general. I\r\nprefer restricting it to the peculiar class of cases commonly known as\r\nsleep-walking.]\r\n\r\nThe seizure mostly comes on during common sleep. But it may supervene\r\nin the daytime; in which case the patient first falls into the lightest\r\nform of trance-sleep. After a little, still lost to things around\r\nhim, he manifests one or more of three impulses: one, to speak, but\r\ncoherently and to a purpose; a second, to dress, rise, and leave his\r\nroom with an evident intention of going somewhither; a third, to\r\npractise some habitual mechanical employment. In each case he appears\r\nto be pursuing the thread of a dream. If he speaks, it is a connected\r\ndiscourse to some end. If he goes out to walk, it is to a spot he\r\ncontemplates visiting; his general turn is to climb ascents, hills, or\r\nthe roofs of houses: in the latter case he sometimes examines if the\r\ntiles are secure before he steps on them. If he pursues a customary\r\noccupation, whether it be cleaning harness or writing music, he\r\nfinishes his work before he leaves it. He is acting a dream, which is\r\nconnected and sustained. The attention is keenly awake in this dream,\r\nand favours its accomplishment to the utmost. In the mean time the\r\nsomnambulist appears to be insensible to ordinary impressions, and to\r\ntake no cognisance of what is going on around him—a light maybe held so\r\nclose to his eyes as to singe his eyebrows without his noticing it—he\r\nseems neither to hear nor to taste—the eyelids are generally closed,\r\notherwise the eyes are fixed and vacant. Nevertheless he possesses some\r\nmeans of recognising the objects which are implicated in his dream; he\r\nperceives their place, and walks among them with perfect precision.\r\nLet me narrate some instances. The first, one of day-somnambulism,\r\nexemplifies, at the same time, the transitions to full waking, which\r\nmanifest themselves occasionally in the talking form of the trance. The\r\ncase is from the _Acta Vratisv._ ann. 1722.\r\n\r\nA girl, seventeen years of age, was used to fall into a kind of sleep\r\nin the afternoon, in which it was supposed, from her expression of\r\ncountenance and her gestures, that she was engaged in dreams that\r\ninterested her. (She was then in light trance-sleep, initiatory\r\ntrance.) After some days she began to speak when in this state. Then\r\nif those present addressed remarks to her, she replied very sensibly,\r\nbut then fell back into her dream discourse, which turned principally\r\nupon religious and moral topics, and was directed to warn her friends\r\nhow a female should live—Christianly, well governed, and so as to incur\r\nno reproach. When she sang, which often happened, she heard herself\r\naccompanied by an imaginary violin or piano, and would take up and\r\ncontinue the accompaniment upon an instrument herself. She sewed, did\r\nknitting, and the like. She imagined, on one occasion, that she wrote a\r\nletter upon a napkin, which she folded for the post. Upon waking, she\r\nhad not the slightest recollection of any thing that had passed. After\r\na few months she recovered.\r\n\r\nThe following case is from the Hamburgh _Zeitschrift für die gesammte\r\nMedicin_, 1848:—\r\n\r\nA lad of eleven years of age, at school at Tarbes, was surprised\r\nseveral mornings running at finding himself dressed in bed, though he\r\nhad undressed himself overnight. Then on the 3d of May he was seen by\r\na neighbour, soon after three in the morning, to go out dressed with\r\nhis cloak and hat on. She called to him, but he did not answer; and she\r\nconcluded that he was going to Bagnères with his father. In fact that\r\nwas the road he took; and he was afterwards seen by several persons\r\nnear Bagnères, trudging after a carriage. It rained hard; and they were\r\nsurprised to see so young a lad travelling at so early an hour; but\r\nthey thought he probably belonged to the people in the carriage. He\r\nreached Bagnères at half past five, having done the distance of five\r\npost leagues in two hours and a quarter. He went to the hotel of M.\r\nLafargue, which he had on a former occasion visited with his father,\r\nand entered the eating-room. The people of the hotel addressed him. He\r\ntold them that he had come with his father in a post-chaise, and that\r\nthey would find his father in the yard busied with the carriage. M.\r\nLafargue went out to look for him. In the mean time the people of the\r\nhouse observed that the boy’s remarks were incoherent; so they took off\r\nhis cloak and cap, when they found that his eyelids were closed, and\r\nthat he was fast asleep. They led him towards the stove, took off his\r\nwet things and his boots without awakening him; but before they had\r\ncompletely undressed him to put him to bed he awoke. The impressions of\r\nhis dream did not desert him. He complained of having had a bad night;\r\nand asked for his father. They told him his father had been obliged to\r\nset off again immediately. They put him to bed, and he slept. They sent\r\nintelligence to his father, who came to Bagnères. The boy believed, and\r\nbelieves still, that he came to Bagnères with his father in a chaise\r\nthat was driven very slowly. Being asked what he had seen on the road,\r\nhe described having passed a number of monks and priests in procession.\r\nHe said there was one good-looking young man who did not leave him,\r\nbut was always saying, “Good day, Joseph; Adieu, Joseph.” He said that\r\nwhat had most annoyed him was the burning heat of the sun, which was so\r\nintense that he had been obliged to wrap himself up in his cloak; that\r\nhe could not bear its bright light.\r\n\r\nThe following case of somnambulism, allied with St. Vietz’s dance, is\r\ngiven by Lord Monboddo:—\r\n\r\nThe patient, about sixteen years of age, used to be commonly taken\r\nin the morning a few hours after rising. The approach of the seizure\r\nwas announced by a sense of weight in the head and drowsiness, which\r\nquickly terminated in sleep, (trance-sleep,) in which her eyes were\r\nfast shut. She described a feeling beginning in the feet, creeping\r\nlike a gradual chill higher and higher, till it reached the heart,\r\nwhen consciousness left her. Being in this state, she sprang from her\r\nseat about the room, over tables and chairs, with astonishing agility.\r\nThen, if she succeeded in getting out of the house, she ran, at a pace\r\nwith which her elder brother could hardly keep up, to a particular\r\nspot in the neighbourhood, taking the directest but the roughest path.\r\nIf she could not manage otherwise, she got over the garden wall, with\r\nastonishing rapidity and precision of movement. Her eyelids were all\r\nthe time fast closed. The impulse to visit this spot she was often\r\nconscious of during the approach of the paroxysm, and afterwards she\r\nsometimes thought that she had dreamed of going thither. Towards the\r\ntermination of her indisposition, she dreamed that the water of a\r\nneighbouring spring would do her good, and she drank much of it. One\r\ntime they tried to cheat her by giving her water from another spring,\r\nbut she immediately detected the difference. Near the end, she foretold\r\nthat she would have three paroxysms more, and then be well; and so it\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe next case is from a communication by M. Pigatti, published in the\r\nJuly number of the _Journal Encyclo__pedique_ of the year 1662. The\r\nsubject was a servant of the name of Negretti, in the household of the\r\nMarquis Sale.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Negretti would seat himself in a chair in the ante-room,\r\nwhen he commonly fell asleep, and would sleep quietly for a quarter of\r\nan hour. He then righted himself in his chair so as to sit up. Then\r\nhe sat some time without motion, looking as if he saw something. Then\r\nhe rose and walked about the room. On one occasion he drew out his\r\nsnuff-box, and would have taken a pinch, but there was little in it;\r\nwhereupon he walked up to an empty chair, and, addressing by name a\r\ncavalier, whom he supposed to be sitting in it, asked him for a pinch.\r\nOne of those who were watching the scene, here held towards him an open\r\nbox, from which he took snuff. Afterward he fell into the posture of\r\na person who listens; he seemed to think that he heard an order, and\r\nthereupon hastened with a wax candle in his hand to a spot where a\r\nlight usually stood. As soon as he imagined that he had lit the candle,\r\nhe walked with it in the proper manner, through the _salle_, down the\r\nsteps, turning and waiting from time to time as if he were lighting\r\nsome one down. Arrived at the door he placed himself sideways, in order\r\nto let the imaginary persons pass; and he bowed as he let them out. He\r\nthen extinguished the light, returned up stairs, and sat himself down\r\nagain in his place, to play the same farce once or twice over again\r\nthe same evening. When in this condition he would lay the table-cloth,\r\nplace the chairs, which he sometimes brought from a distant room,\r\nopening and shutting the doors as he went with exactness; would take\r\ndecanters from the buffet, fill them with water at the spring, put\r\nthem down on a waiter, and so on. All the objects that were concerned\r\nin these operations he distinguished, when they were before him,\r\nwith the same precision and certainty as if he had been in the full\r\nuse of his senses. Otherwise he seemed to observe nothing; so, on one\r\noccasion in passing a table, he threw down a waiter with two decanters\r\nupon it, which fell and broke without attracting his attention. The\r\ndominant idea had entire possession of him. He would prepare a salad\r\nwith correctness, and sit down and eat it. If they changed it, the\r\ntrick escaped his notice. In this manner he would go on eating cabbage,\r\nor even pieces of cake, without observing the difference. The taste he\r\nenjoyed was imaginary, the sense was shut. On another occasion, when\r\nhe asked for wine they gave him water, which he drank for wine, and\r\nremarked that his stomach felt the better for it. On a fellow-servant\r\ntouching his legs with a stick, the idea arose in his mind that it was\r\na dog, and he scolded to drive it away; but the servant continuing his\r\ngame, Negretti took a whip to beat the dog. The servant drew back, when\r\nNegretti began whistling and coaxing to get the dog near him; so they\r\nthrew a muff against his legs, which he belaboured soundly.\r\n\r\nM. Pigatti watched these proceedings with great attention, and\r\nconvinced himself by many experiments that Negretti did not use his\r\nordinary senses. He did not hear the loudest sound when it lay out of\r\nthe circle of his dream-ideas. If a light was held close to his eyes,\r\nnear enough to singe his eyebrows, he did not appear to be aware of\r\nit. He seemed to feel nothing when they inserted a feather into his\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting case of somnambulism on record is that\r\nof a young ecclesiastic, the narrative of which, from the immediate\r\ncommunication of the Archbishop of Bordeaux, is given under the head\r\nof Somnambulism, in the _French Encyclopedia_.\r\n\r\nThis young ecclesiastic, when the archbishop was at the same seminary,\r\nused to rise every night, and write out either sermons or pieces of\r\nmusic. To study his condition, the archbishop betook himself several\r\nnights consecutively to the chamber of the young man, where he made the\r\nfollowing observations:—\r\n\r\nThe young man used to rise, take paper, and begin to write. Before\r\nwriting music, he would take a stick and rule the lines with it. He\r\nwrote the notes, together with the words corresponding to them, with\r\nperfect correctness; or when he had written the words too wide, he\r\naltered them. The notes that were to be black he filled in after he had\r\nwritten the whole. After completing a sermon, he would read it aloud\r\nfrom beginning to end. If any passage displeased him, he erased it, and\r\nwrote the amended passage correctly over the other. On one occasion he\r\nhad substituted the word “adorable” for “divin;” but he did not omit\r\nto alter the preceding “ce” into “cet,” by adding the letter “t” with\r\nexact precision to the word first written. To ascertain whether he used\r\nhis eyes, the archbishop interposed a sheet of pasteboard between the\r\nwriting and his face. The somnambulist took not the least notice, but\r\nwent on writing as before. The limitation of his perceptions to what\r\nhe was thinking about was very curious. A bit of aniseed cake, that\r\nhe had sought for, he ate approvingly; but when, on another occasion,\r\na piece of the same cake was put into his mouth, he spat it out\r\nwithout observation. The following instance of the dependence of his\r\nperceptions upon his preconceived ideas is truly wonderful. It is to\r\nbe observed that he always knew when his pen had ink in it. Likewise,\r\nif they adroitly changed his papers when he was writing, he knew it,\r\nif the sheet substituted was of a different size from the former, and\r\nhe appeared embarrassed in that case. But if the fresh sheet of paper,\r\nwhich was substituted for that written on, was exactly of the same\r\nsize with it, he appeared not to be aware of the change. And he would\r\ncontinue to read off his composition from the blank sheet of paper,\r\nas fluently as when the manuscript lay before him; nay more, he would\r\ncontinue his corrections, and introduce an amended passage, writing\r\nit upon exactly the place in the blank sheet corresponding with that\r\nwhich it would have occupied on the written page.—Such are the feats of\r\nsomnambulists.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the phenomena thus exemplified appear strange and\r\nunintelligible enough. But upon a careful consideration of them, much\r\nof the marvellous disappears. The most curious features seem, in the\r\nend, to be really the least deserving of wonder. The simplest of the\r\nphenomena are alone the inexplicable ones.\r\n\r\nI have, however, advanced this group of cases as instances of trance,\r\nin which, therefore, I assume that an abnormal relation exists between\r\nthe mind and body, in which the organs of sensation are partially or\r\nentirely deserted by their functions, and in which new perceptive\r\npowers manifest themselves. Then an opponent might argue:—\r\n\r\n“I know nothing about your trance. What I see is first a person\r\nasleep, then the same person half or partially awake, occupied with\r\na dream or vivid conception of an action; which, being partially\r\nawake, and therefore having partially resumed his power of attention,\r\nhe is capable of realizing. He appears to be insensible; but this\r\nmay be deceptive; for he is still asleep, and therefore notices not\r\nthings around him; and his attention is partly still suspended as in\r\nsleep, partly more useless still for general purposes through intent\r\npreoccupation.\r\n\r\n“He goes about the house in his rapt state, and finds his way\r\nperfectly; but the house is familiar to him; every thing in it is\r\ndistinctly before his conception; he has, too, the advantage of perfect\r\nconfidence; and besides, being partially awake, he partially, vaguely\r\nperhaps, uses customary sensations in reference to the objects which\r\nhis dream contemplates his meeting.\r\n\r\n“The ecclesiastic, indeed, seems at first to see through a sheet of\r\npasteboard. But the concluding interesting fact in his case shows that\r\nhe really used his perception only to identify the size and place of\r\nthe sheet of paper. His writing upon it was the mechanical transcript\r\nof an act of mental penmanship. The corrections fell into the right\r\nplaces upon the paper, owing to the fidelity with which he retained the\r\nmental picture. The clearness and vividness of the picture, again, is\r\nnot so very surprising, when it is considered that the attention was\r\nwholly and exclusively concentrated on that one operation.”\r\n\r\nThe observations of my imaginary opponent might sufficiently account\r\nfor the more striking phenomena in the preceding cases, and are\r\ndoubtless near the truth as regards the principal parts of the young\r\necclesiastic’s performance. Still there remains the commoner instance\r\nof the lad going about with precision with his eyes shut. I see no mode\r\nof accounting for that on common principles.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, it may be presumed that, if more decisive experiments\r\nas to their sensibility had been made upon all these subjects, they\r\nwould have been found really without sight and feeling. For, in\r\ngeneral character, persons in somnambulism exactly resemble other\r\nentranced persons, who certainly feel nothing; for they have borne\r\nthe most painful surgical operations without the smallest indication\r\nof suffering. So I have little doubt that the insensibility, which the\r\nobservers imputed to the somnambulists, really existed, although they\r\nmay have failed to establish the fact by positive evidence.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the development of a new power of perception, such\r\nas I conjecture the lad used in his walk from Tarbes to Bagnères,\r\nwill be found to be resolved, or, at any rate, to be attended with\r\nno theoretical difficulties, when the performances of full-waking in\r\ntrance, which I propose to describe in the next letter, shall have been\r\nlaid before the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\n TRANCE-WAKING.—Instances of its spontaneous occurrence in the form\r\n of catalepsy—Analysis of catalepsy—Its three elements: double\r\n consciousness, or pure waking-trance; the spasmodic seizure; the\r\n new mental powers displayed—Cases exemplifying catalepsy—Other\r\n cases unattended with spasm, but of spontaneous occurrence, in\r\n which new mental powers were manifested—Oracles of antiquity—Animal\r\n instinct—Intuition.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head are contained the most marvellous phenomena which\r\never came as a group of facts in natural philosophy before the world;\r\nand they are reaching that stage towards general reception when their\r\neffect is most vivid and striking. Five-and-twenty years ago no one in\r\nEngland dreamed of believing them, although the same positive evidence\r\nof their genuineness then existed as now. Five-and-twenty years hence\r\nthe same facts will be matters of familiar knowledge. It is just at\r\nthe present moment (or am I anticipating the march of opinion by half\r\na century?) that their difference, and distinctness, and abhorrence\r\neven, from our previous conceptions are most intensely felt; and that\r\nthe powers which they promise eventually to place within human control\r\nexcite our irrepressible wonder.\r\n\r\nI shall narrate the facts which loom so large in the dawning light,\r\nvery simply and briefly, as they are manifested in catalepsy.\r\n\r\nAn uninformed person being in the room with a cataleptic patient, would\r\nat first suppose her, putting aside the spasmodic affection of the\r\nbody, to be simply awake in the ordinary way. By-and-by her new powers\r\nmight or might not catch his observation. But a third point would\r\ncertainly escape his notice. I refer to her mental state of waking\r\ntrance, which gives, as it were, the local colouring to the whole\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate this element, I may avail myself of a sketch ready\r\nprepared by nature, tinted with the local colour alone—the case of\r\nsimple trance-waking, unattended by fits or by any marvellous powers,\r\nas far as it has been yet observed, which is known to physicians under\r\nthe name of double consciousness.\r\n\r\nA single fit of the disorder presents the following features:—The\r\nyoung person (for the patient is most frequently a girl) seems to\r\nlose herself for a moment or longer, then she recovers, and seems to\r\nbe herself again. The intervening short period, longer at first, and\r\nby use rendered briefer and briefer, is a period of common initiatory\r\ntrance. When, having lost, the patient thus finds herself again, there\r\nis nothing in her behaviour which would lead a stranger to suppose her\r\nother than naturally awake. But her friends observe that she now does\r\nevery thing with more spirit and better than before—sings better, plays\r\nbetter, has more readiness, moves even more gracefully, than in her\r\nusual state. She manifests an innocent boldness and disregard of little\r\nconventionalisms, which impart a peculiar charm to her behaviour.\r\nHer mode of speaking is perhaps something altered; a supernumerary\r\nconsonant making its undue appearance, but upon a regular law, in\r\ncertain syllables. But the most striking thing is, that she has totally\r\nforgotten all that has passed during the morning. Inquire what her last\r\nrecollections are, they leave off with the termination of her last fit\r\nof this kind; the intervening period is for the present lost to her.\r\nShe was in her natural state of waking when I introduced her to your\r\nnotice; she lost herself for a few seconds, found herself again; but\r\nfound herself not in her natural train of recollections, but in those\r\nof the last fit.\r\n\r\nThese fits occur sometimes at irregular intervals, sometimes\r\nperiodically and daily. In her ordinary waking state, she has her chain\r\nof waking recollections. In her trance-waking state, she has her chain\r\nof trance-waking recollections. The two are kept strictly apart. Hence\r\nthe ill-chosen term, double-consciousness. So at the occurrence of her\r\nfirst fit, her mental existence may be said to have bifurcated into two\r\nseparate routes, in either of which her being is alternately passed.\r\nIt is curious to study, at the commencement of such a case, with how\r\nmuch knowledge derived from her past life the patient embarks on her\r\ntrance-existence. The number of previously realized ideas retained by\r\ndifferent patients at the first fit is very various. It has happened\r\nthat the memory of facts and persons has been so defective that the\r\npatient has had to learn even to know and to love her parents. To most\r\nof her acquaintances she is observed to give new names, which she uses\r\nto them in the trance-state alone. But her habits remain; her usual\r\npropriety of conduct: the mind is singularly pure in trance. And she\r\nvery quickly picks up former ideas, and restores former intimacies,\r\nbut on a supposed new footing. To complete this curious history, if\r\nthe fits of trance recur frequently, and through some accidental\r\ncircumstance are more and more prolonged in duration, so that most\r\nof her waking existence is passed in trance, it will follow that the\r\ntrance-development of her intellect and character may get ahead of\r\ntheir development in her natural waking. Being told this, she may\r\nbecome anxious to continue always in her entranced state, and to drop\r\nthe other: and I knew a case in which circumstances favoured this final\r\narrangement, and the patient at last retained her trance-recollections\r\nalone, from long continuance in that state having made it, as it were,\r\nher natural one. Her only fear was—for she had gradually learned her\r\nown mental history, as she expressed it to me—that some day she should\r\nof a sudden find herself a child again, thrown back to the point at\r\nwhich she ceased her first order of recollections. This is, indeed, a\r\nvery extreme and monstrous case. Ordinarily, the recurrence of fits of\r\nsimple trance-waking does not extend over a longer period than three or\r\nfour months or half a year, after which they never reappear; and her\r\ntrance acquirements and feelings are lost to the patient’s recollection\r\nfor good. I will cite a case, as it was communicated to me by Dr. G.\r\nBarlow, exemplifying some of the points of the preceding statement.\r\n\r\n“This young lady has two states of existence. During the time that\r\nthe fit is on her, which varies from a few hours to three days, she\r\nis occasionally merry and in spirits; occasionally she appears in\r\npain, and rolls about in uneasiness; but in general she seems so much\r\nherself, that a stranger entering the room would not remark any thing\r\nextraordinary: she amuses herself with reading or working, sometimes\r\nplays on the piano—and better than at other times—knows every body, and\r\nconverses rationally, and makes very accurate observations on what she\r\nhas seen and read. The fit leaves her suddenly, and she then forgets\r\nevery thing that has passed during it, and imagines that she has been\r\nasleep, and sometimes that she has dreamed of any circumstance that\r\nhas made a vivid impression upon her. During one of these fits she was\r\nreading Miss Edgeworth’s Tales, and had in the morning been reading\r\na part of one of them to her mother, when she went for a few minutes\r\nto the window, and suddenly exclaimed, “Mamma, I am quite well, my\r\nheadache is gone.” Returning to the table, she took up the open volume,\r\nwhich she had been reading five minutes before, and said, “What book\r\nis this?” She turned over the leaves, looked at the frontispiece, and\r\nreplaced it on the table. Seven or eight hours afterwards, when the fit\r\nreturned, she asked for the book, went on at the very paragraph where\r\nshe had left off, and remembered every circumstance of the narrative.\r\nAnd so it always is; she reads one set of books during one state, and\r\nanother during the other. She seems to be conscious of her state; for\r\nshe said one day, “Mamma, this is a novel, but I may safely read it; it\r\nwill not hurt my morals, for, when I am well, I shall not remember a\r\nword of it.””\r\n\r\nTo form a just idea of a case of catalepsy, the reader has to imagine\r\nsuch a case as I have just instanced, with the physical feature added,\r\nthat the patient, when entranced, is motionless and fixed as a statue;\r\nthe spasmodic state, however, not confining itself closely to one\r\ntype, but running into catochus, or into partial rigid spasm, or into\r\nconvulsive seizures, (see Letter V.) capriciously.\r\n\r\nThe psychical phenomena exhibited by the patient when thus entranced,\r\nare the following:—\r\n\r\n1. The organs of sensation are deserted by their natural sensibility.\r\nThe patient neither feels with the skin, nor sees with the eyes, nor\r\nhears with the ears, nor tastes with the mouth.\r\n\r\n2. All these senses, however, are not lost. Sight and hearing, if not\r\nsmell and taste, reappear in some other part—at the pit of the stomach,\r\nfor instance, or the tips of the fingers.\r\n\r\n3. The patient manifests new perceptive powers. She discerns objects\r\nall around her, and through any obstructions, partitions, walls or\r\nhouses, and at an indefinite distance. She sees her own inside, as it\r\nwere, illuminated, and can tell what is wrong in the health of others.\r\nShe reads the thoughts of others, whether present or at indefinite\r\ndistances. The ordinary obstacles of space and matter vanish to her. So\r\nlikewise that of time; she foresees future events.\r\n\r\nSuch and more are the capabilities of cataleptic patients, most of whom\r\nexhibit them all—but there is some caprice in their manifestation.\r\n\r\nI first resigned myself to the belief that such statements as the above\r\nmight be true, upon being shown by the late Mr. Bulteel letters from an\r\neminent provincial physician in the year 1838, describing phenomena of\r\nthis description in a patient the latter was attending. In the spring\r\nof 1839, Mr. Bulteel told me that he had himself in the interim often\r\nseen the patient, who had allowed him to test in any way he pleased\r\nthe reality of the faculties she possessed when entranced. As usual,\r\nin the hours which she passed daily in her natural state, she had no\r\nrecollection of her extraordinary trance performances. The following\r\nare some of the facts, which Mr. Bulteel told me he had himself\r\nverified.\r\n\r\nWhen entranced, the patient’s expression of countenance was slightly\r\naltered, and there was some peculiarity in her mode of speaking. To\r\neach of her friends she had given a new name, which she used only\r\nwhen in the state of trance. She could read with her skin. If she\r\npressed the palm of her hand against the whole surface of a printed\r\nor written page deliberately, as it were, to take off an impression,\r\nshe became acquainted verbally with its contents, even to the extent\r\nof criticising the type or the handwriting. One day, after a remark\r\nmade to put her off her guard, a line of a folded note was pressed\r\nagainst the back of her neck; she had read it. She called this\r\nsense-feeling—contact was necessary for its manifestation. But she had\r\na general perceptive power besides. She used to tell that persons,\r\nwhom she knew, were coming to the house, when they were yet at some\r\ndistance. Persons sitting in the room with her playing chess, to whom\r\nher back was turned, if they made intentionally false moves, she would\r\nask them what they possibly could do that for.\r\n\r\nThe next three cases which I shall describe are from a memoir on\r\ncatalepsy (1787) by Dr. Petetin, an eminent civil and military\r\nphysician at Lyons.\r\n\r\nM. Petetin attended a young married lady in a sort of fit. She lay\r\nseemingly unconscious; when he raised her arm, it remained in the air\r\nwhere he placed it. Being put to bed, she commenced singing. To stop\r\nher, the doctor placed her limbs each in a different position. This\r\nembarrassed her considerably, but she went on singing. She seemed\r\nperfectly insensible. Pinching the skin, shouting in her ear, nothing\r\naroused her attention. Then it happened that, in arranging her, the\r\ndoctor’s foot slipped; and, as he recovered himself, half leaning over\r\nher, he said, “How provoking we can’t make her leave off singing!”\r\n“Ah, doctor,” she cried, “don’t be angry! I won’t sing any more,” and\r\nshe stopped. But shortly she began again; and in vain did the doctor\r\nimplore her, by the loudest entreaties, addressed to her ear, to keep\r\nher promise and desist. It then occurred to him to place himself in the\r\nsame position as when she heard him before. He raised the bed-clothes,\r\nbent his head towards her stomach, and said, in a loud voice, “Do you,\r\nthen, mean to sing for ever?” “Oh, what pain you have given me!” she\r\nexclaimed; “I implore you speak lower.” At the same time she passed her\r\nhand over the pit of her stomach. “In what way, then, do you hear?”\r\nsaid Dr. Petetin. “Like any one else,” was the answer. “But I am\r\nspeaking to your stomach.” “Is it possible!” she said. He then tried\r\nagain whether she could hear with her ears, speaking even through a\r\ntube to aggravate his voice—she heard nothing. On his asking her, at\r\nthe pit of her stomach, if she had not heard him,—“No,” said she, “I am\r\nindeed unfortunate.”\r\n\r\nA cognate phenomenon to the above is _the conversion of the patient’s\r\nnew sense of vision in a direction inwards_. He looks into himself,\r\nand sees his own inside as it were illuminated or transfigured: that\r\nis to say, his visual power is turned inwards, and he sees his organs\r\npossibly by the Od-light they give out.\r\n\r\nA few days after the scenes just described, Dr. Petetin’s patient\r\nhad another attack of catalepsy. She still heard at the pit of her\r\nstomach, but the manner of hearing was modified. In the mean time her\r\ncountenance expressed astonishment. Dr. Petetin inquired the cause.\r\n“It is not difficult,” she answered, “to explain to you why I look\r\nastonished. I am singing, doctor, to divert my attention from a sight\r\nwhich appals me. I see my inside, and the strange forms of the organs,\r\nsurrounded with a network of light. My countenance must express what I\r\nfeel—astonishment and fear. A physician who should have my complaint\r\nfor a quarter of an hour would think himself fortunate, as nature would\r\nreveal all her secrets to him. If he was devoted to his profession,\r\nhe would not, as I do, desire to be quickly well.” “Do you see your\r\nheart?” asked Dr. Petetin. “Yes, there it is; it beats at twice, the\r\ntwo sides in agreement; when the upper part contracts, the lower part\r\nswells, and immediately after that contracts. The blood rushes out\r\nall luminous, and issues by two great vessels, which are but a little\r\napart.”\r\n\r\nOne morning (to quote from the latter part of this case) the access\r\nof the fit took place, according to custom, at eight o’clock. Petetin\r\narrived later than usual; he announced himself by speaking to the\r\nfingers of the patient, (by which he was heard.) “You are a very lazy\r\nperson this morning, doctor,” said she. “It is true, madam; but if\r\nyou knew the reason, you would not reproach me.” “Ah,” said she, “I\r\nperceive you have had a headache for the last four hours: it will not\r\nleave you till six in the evening. You are right to take nothing; no\r\nhuman means can prevent it running its course.” “Can you tell me on\r\nwhich side is the pain?” said Petetin. “On the right side; it occupies\r\nthe temple, the eye, the teeth: I warn you that it will invade the\r\nleft eye, and that you will suffer considerably between three and four\r\no’clock; at six you will be free from pain.” The prediction came out\r\nliterally true. “If you wish me to believe you, you must tell me what I\r\nhold in my hand.” “I see through your hand an antique medal.”\r\n\r\nPetetin inquired of his patient at what hour her own fit would cease:\r\n“At eleven.” “And the evening accession—when will it come on?” “At\r\nseven o’clock.” “In that case it will be later than usual.” “It is\r\ntrue; the periods of its recurrence are going to change to so and\r\nso.” During this conversation, the patient’s countenance expressed\r\nannoyance. She then said to M. Petetin, “My uncle has just entered; he\r\nis conversing with my husband behind the screen; his visit will fatigue\r\nme; beg him to go away.” The uncle, leaving, took with him by mistake\r\nher husband’s cloak, which she perceived, and sent her sister-in-law to\r\nreclaim it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there were assembled, in the lady’s apartment, a good\r\nnumber of her relations and friends. Petetin had, intentionally, placed\r\na letter within his waistcoat, on his heart. He begged permission, on\r\narriving, to wear his cloak. Scarcely had the lady, the access having\r\ncome on, fallen into trance, when she said—“And how long, doctor, has\r\nit come into fashion to wear letters next the heart?” Petetin pretended\r\nto deny the fact: she insisted on her correctness; and, raising her\r\nhands, designated the size, and indicated exactly the place of the\r\nletter. Petetin drew forth the letter, and held it, closed, to the\r\nfingers of the patient. “If I were not a discreet person,” she said,\r\n“I should tell the contents; but to show you that I know them, they\r\nform exactly two lines and a-half of writing;” which, on opening the\r\nletter, was shown to be the fact.\r\n\r\nA friend of the family, who was present, took out his purse, and put\r\nit in Dr. Petetin’s bosom, and folded his cloak over his chest. As\r\nsoon as Petetin approached his patient, she told him that he had the\r\npurse, and named its exact contents. She then gave an inventory of the\r\ncontents of the pockets of all present, adding some pointed remark\r\nwhen the opportunity offered. She said to her sister-in-law that the\r\nmost interesting thing in _her_ possession was a letter;—much to her\r\nsurprise, for she had received the letter the same evening, and had\r\nmentioned it to no one.\r\n\r\nThe patient, in the mean time, lost strength daily, and could take no\r\nfood. The means employed failed of giving her relief, and it never\r\noccurred to M. Petetin to inquire of her how he should treat her. At\r\nlength, with some vague idea that she suffered from too great electric\r\ntension of the brain, he tried, fantastically enough, the effect of\r\nmaking deep inspirations, standing close in front of the patient. No\r\neffect followed from this absurd proceeding. Then he placed one hand\r\non the forehead, the other on the pit of the stomach of the patient,\r\nand continued his inspirations. The patient now opened her eyes; her\r\nfeatures lost their fixed look; she rallied rapidly from the fit, which\r\nlasted but a few minutes instead of the usual period of two hours\r\nmore. In eight days, under a pursuance of this treatment, she entirely\r\nrecovered from her fits, and with them ceased her extraordinary\r\npowers. But, during these eight days, her powers manifested a still\r\ngreater extension; she foretold what was going to happen to her; she\r\ndiscussed with astonishing subtlety, questions of mental philosophy and\r\nphysiology; she caught what those around her meant to say before they\r\nexpressed their wishes, and either did what they desired, or begged\r\nthat they would not ask her to do what was beyond her strength.\r\n\r\nA young lady, after much alarm during a revolutionary riot, fell\r\ninto catalepsy. In her fits she appeared to hear with the pit of\r\nthe stomach; and most of the phenomena described in the preceding\r\ncase were again manifested. She improved in health, under the care\r\nof Dr. Petetin, up to the 29th of May, 1790, the memorable day when\r\nthe inhabitants of Lyons expelled the wretches who were making sport\r\nof their fortunes, their liberties, and their lives. At the report\r\nof the first cannon fired, Mdlle. —— fell into violent convulsions,\r\nfollowed by catalepsy and tetanus. When in this state she discerned\r\nPetetin distinguishing himself under the fire of a battery; and she\r\nblamed him the following day for having so rashly exposed his life. In\r\nthe progress of the complaint, during the attacks of catalepsy, the\r\noccurrences of which she exactly foresaw, she likewise predicted the\r\nbloody day of the 29th of September, the surrender of the city on the\r\n7th of October, the entrance of the republican troops on the 8th, and\r\nthe cruel proscriptions issued by the Committee of Public Safety.\r\n\r\nThe third case given by Petetin is that of Madame de Saint Paul,\r\nwho was attacked with catalepsy a few days after her marriage, in\r\nconsequence of seeing her father fall down in a fit of apoplexy at\r\ntable. The general features of her lucidity are the same as in the\r\nformer cases. I shall, therefore, content myself with quoting some\r\nobservations made by Dr. Prost, author of _La Médecine éclairée par\r\nl’Observation et l’Anatomie pathologique_, on the authority of Dr.\r\nFoissac, to whom he communicated them. Dr. Prost had studied this case\r\nassiduously during nine months. “Her intellectual faculties,” observed\r\nDr. Prost, “acquired a great activity, and the richness of her fancy\r\nmade itself remarked in the picturesque images which she threw into\r\nher descriptions. As she was telling her friends of an approaching\r\nattack of catalepsy, suddenly she exclaimed,—‘I no longer see or hear\r\nobjects in the same manner; every thing is transparent round me, and\r\nmy observation extends to incalculable distances.’ She designated,\r\nwithout an error, the people who were on the public promenade, whether\r\nnear the house, or still a quarter of an hour’s walk distant. She read\r\nthe thoughts of every one who came near her; she marked those who were\r\nfalse and vicious; and repelled the approach of stupid people, who\r\nbored her with their questions and aggravated her malady. ‘Just as\r\nmuch as their pates excite my pity,’ said she, ‛do the heads of men of\r\ninformation and intelligence, all whose thoughts I look into, fill me\r\nwith delight.’”\r\n\r\nThe following facts I cite corroboratively, from one of several cases\r\nof hysteria communicated by Dr. Delpit, inspecting physician of the\r\nwaters at Barèges.—(_Bibliotheque Médicale_, t. lvi. p. 308.)\r\n\r\nMdlle. V——, aged thirteen, after seeing the curé administer extreme\r\nunction, fainted away. There followed extreme disgust towards food.\r\nDuring eighteen days she neither ate nor drank; there was no secretion;\r\nher breathing remained tranquil and regular; the patient preserved\r\nher embonpoint and complexion. During this complete suspension of the\r\nfunctions of digestion, the organs of sensation would be alternately\r\nparalyzed. One day the patient became blind; on the next, she could\r\nsee, but could not hear; another day she lost her speech. The\r\nmutations were noticed generally in the night, upon her waking out\r\nof sleep. “Nevertheless,” says M. Delpit, “her intellect preserved\r\nall its vivacity and force, and, during the palsy of the organs of\r\nsensation, nature supplied the loss in another way; when, with her\r\neyes, Mdlle. Caroline could not distinguish light, she yet read, and\r\nread distinctly, by carrying her fingers over the letters. I have made\r\nher thus read, in the daytime and in the profoundest darkness, either\r\nprinted pages out of the first book that came to hand, or written\r\npassages that I had previously prepared.” In this, the alternation\r\nof different states of recollections is not described as having been\r\nobserved. But I have little doubt that double consciousness was really\r\npresent. I believe that feature to be essential to waking trance. I\r\nhave little doubt, likewise, that double consciousness is attended by\r\nmore or less trance-perception. The co-existence of spasm, necessary to\r\nconstitute the case one of catalepsy, is accidental.\r\n\r\nSensorial illusions occasionally occur in catalepsy, but not\r\nfrequently; they are commoner in the inferior grades of trance. The\r\ndaimon of Socrates was, no doubt, a hallucination of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe trance-daimon, or sensorial illusion mixing itself with trance, is\r\nexemplified in the following case of catalepsy, which occurred in the\r\nperson of the adopted daughter of the Baron de Strombeck.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary features, on which I will not again dwell, at one\r\ntime it was her custom to apply to an imaginary being for directions\r\nas to the treatment of her own case. Subsequently, she one day\r\nobserved—“It is not a phantom; I was in error in thinking it so; it\r\nis a voice which speaks within me, and which I think without me. This\r\napparition comes because my sleep is less perfect. In that case, I seem\r\nto see a white cloud rise out of the earth, from which a voice issues,\r\nthe echo of which reverberates within me.”\r\n\r\nThis patient had quintuple consciousness, or four morbid states, each\r\nof which kept its own recollections to itself.\r\n\r\nA final case I will quote, the authority of which is the Baron de\r\nFortis. It was treated by Dr. Despine of Aix-les-Bains.\r\n\r\nThe patient had had epilepsy, for the cure of which she went to Aix.\r\nThere she had all sorts of fits and day-somnambulism, during which\r\nshe waited at table, with her eyes shut, perfectly. She likewise saw\r\nalternately with her fingers, the palm of her hand, and her elbow, and\r\nwould write with precision with her right hand, superintending the\r\nprocess with her left elbow. These details are peculiarly gratifying\r\nto myself, for in the little I have seen, I yet have seen a patient\r\nwalk about with her eyes shut, and well blinded besides, holding the\r\nknuckles of one hand before her as a seeing lantern. However, the\r\nspecial interest of this case is, that the patient was differently\r\naffected by different kinds of matter; glass appeared to burn her,\r\nporcelain was pleasantly warm, earthenware felt cold.\r\n\r\nWhat comment can I make on the preceding wondrous details? Those to\r\nwhom they are new must have time to become familiar with them; in\r\norder, reversing the process by which the eye gets to see in the dark,\r\nto learn to distinguish objects in this flood of excessive light. Those\r\nwho are already acquainted with them will, I think, agree with me that\r\nthe principle which I have assumed—the possibility of an abnormal\r\nrelation of the mind and body allowing the former, either to shift the\r\nplace of its manifestations in the nervous system, or partially to\r\nenergize as free spirit—is the only one which at present offers any\r\nsolution of the new powers displayed in catalepsy. One regrets that\r\nmore was not made of the opportunities of observation which Petetin\r\nenjoyed. But there are means, which I shall by-and-by have occasion to\r\nspecify, through which, in the practice of medicine, and in the proper\r\ntreatment of various disorders, like instances may be artificially\r\nmultiplied and modified so as to meet the exigencies of inductive\r\nscience. In the mean time, let me append one or two corollaries to the\r\npreceding demonstration.\r\n\r\nI. It is evident that the performances of catalepsy reduce the oracles\r\nof antiquity to natural phenomena. Let us examine the tradition of that\r\nof Delphi.\r\n\r\nDiodorus relates, that goats feeding near an opening in the ground\r\nwere observed to jump about in a singular manner, and that a goatherd\r\napproaching to examine the spot was taken with a fit and prophesied.\r\nThen the priests took possession of the spot and built a temple.\r\nPlutarch tells us that the priestess was an uneducated peasant-girl,\r\nof good character and conduct. Placed upon the tripod, and affected\r\nby the exhalation, she struggled and became convulsed, and foamed at\r\nthe mouth; and in that state she delivered the oracular answer. The\r\nconvulsions were sometimes so violent that the Pythia died. Plutarch\r\nadds, that the answers were never in error, and that their established\r\ntruth filled the temple with offerings from the whole of Greece, and\r\nfrom barbarian nations. Without supposing it to have been infallible,\r\nwe must, I think, infer that the oracle was too often right to have\r\nbeen wholly a trick. The state of the Pythia was probably trance with\r\nconvulsions, the same with that in which cataleptic patients have\r\nforeseen future events. The priestess was of blameless life, which\r\nsuits the production of trance, the fine susceptibility of which is\r\nspoilt by irregular living. Finally, from what we know of the effects\r\nof the few gases and vapours of which the inhalation has been tried, it\r\nis any thing but improbable that one or other gaseous compound should\r\ndirectly induce trance in predisposed subjects.\r\n\r\nII. The performances of Zschokke are poor by the side of those of a\r\ncataleptic. But then he was not entranced. Nevertheless, an approach to\r\nthat state manifested itself in his losing himself when inspecting his\r\nvisiter’s brains. So again, those who had the gift of second-sight are\r\nrepresented to have been subject to fits of abstraction, in which they\r\nstood rapt. The præternatural gifts of Socrates were probably those of\r\na Highland seer; in which character he is reported to have foretold\r\nthe death of an officer, if he pursued a route he contemplated. The\r\nofficer would not change his plans, and was met by the enemy, and\r\nslain accordingly. In all these cases, the mind seems to have gone\r\nout to seek its knowledge. Two of Mr. Williamson’s lucid patients, of\r\nwhom more afterwards, told him that their minds went out at the backs\r\nof their heads, in starting on these occasions. They pointed to the\r\nlower and back part of the head, opposite to the medulla oblongata.\r\nIn prophetic, and in true retrospective dreams, one may imagine the\r\nphenomena taking the same course; most likely the dreamers have slipt\r\nin their sleep into a brief lucid somnambulism. In the cases of ghosts\r\nand of dreams, coincident with the period of the death of an absent\r\nperson, it seems simpler to suppose the visit to have come from the\r\nother side. So the Vampyr-ghost was probably a visit made by the free\r\npart of the mind of the patient who lay buried in death-trance. The\r\nvisit was fatal to the party visited, because trance is contagious.\r\n\r\nIII. The wonderful performances attributed to instinct in animals\r\nappear less incomprehensible when viewed in juxtaposition with some of\r\nthe feats of lucid cataleptics. The term instinct is a very vague one.\r\nIt is commonly used to denote the intelligence of animals as opposed to\r\nhuman reason. Instinct is, therefore, a compound phenomenon; and I must\r\nbegin by resolving it into its elements. They are three in number:—\r\n\r\n1. Observation and reasoning of the same kind with that of man,\r\nbut limited in their scope. They are exercised only in immediate\r\nself-preservation, and in the direct supply of the creature’s bodily\r\nwants or simple impulses. A dog will whine to get admission into the\r\nhouse, will open the latch of a gate; one rook will sit sentry for the\r\nrest; a plover will fly low, and short distances, as if hurt, to wile\r\naway a dog from her nest. But in this vein of intelligence, animals\r\nmake no further advance. Reflection, with the higher faculties and\r\nsentiments which minister to it, and with it constitute reason, is\r\ndenied them. So they originate no objects of pursuit in the way that\r\nman does, and have no source of self-improvement. But, in lack of human\r\nreflection, some animals receive the help of—\r\n\r\n2. Special conceptions, which are developed in their minds at fitting\r\nseasons. Of this nature, to give an instance, is the notion of\r\nnest-building in birds. It may be observed of these conceptions that\r\nthey appear to us arbitrary, though perfectly suited to the being of\r\neach species: thus, in the example referred to, we may suppose that\r\nthe material and shape of the nest might be varied without its object\r\nbeing the less perfectly attained,—at least, as far as we can see. The\r\nconception spontaneously developed in the mind of the bird is then\r\ncarried out intelligently, through the same quick and just observation,\r\nin a little way, which habitually ministers to its appetites, as I\r\nexplained in a preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe special conception is sometimes characterized by the utmost\r\nperfectness of mechanical design. Here, however, is nothing to surprise\r\nus. The supreme wisdom which preordained the development of an idea\r\nin an insect’s mind, might as easily as not have given it absolute\r\nperfectness. But—\r\n\r\n3. Some animals have the power of modifying the special conception,\r\nwhen circumstances arise which prevent its being carried out in\r\nthe usual way; and of realizing it in a great many different ways,\r\non as many different occasions. And their work, on each of these\r\noccasions, is as perfect as in their carrying out the ordinary form\r\nof the conception. I beg leave to call the principle, by which\r\nthey see thus how to shape their course so perfectly under new\r\ncircumstances—intuition. To instance it, there is a beetle called\r\nthe rhynchites betulæ. Its habit is, towards the end of May, to cut\r\nthe leaves of the betula alba, or betula pubescens, into slips,\r\nwhich it rolls up into funnel-shaped chambers, which form singularly\r\nconvenient cradles for its eggs. This is done after one pattern; and\r\none may suppose it the mechanical realization of an inborn idea, as\r\nlong as the leaf is perfect in shape. But if the leaf is imperfect,\r\nintuition steps upon the scene to aid the insect to cut its coat after\r\nits cloth. The sections made are then seen to vary with the varying\r\nshape of the leaf. Many different sections made by the insect were\r\naccurately drawn by a German naturalist, Dr. Debey. He submitted\r\nthem for examination to Professor Heis of Aix-la-Chapelle. Upon\r\ncarefully studying them, Dr. Heis found these cuttings of the leaves,\r\nin suitableness to the end proposed, even to the minutest technical\r\ndetail, to be in accordance with calculations compassable only through\r\nthe higher mathematics, which, till modern times, were unknown to\r\nhuman intelligence. Such is the marvellous power of “intuition,”\r\ndisplayed by certain insects. I know not how to define it but as a\r\npower of immediate reference to absolute truth, evinced by the insect\r\nin carrying out its little plans. It is evident that the insect uses\r\nthe same power in realizing its ordinary special conception, when the\r\nresult displays equal perfectness. And the question even crosses one’s\r\nmind, Are the seemingly arbitrary plans really arbitrary?—may they not\r\nequally represent a highest type of design? But, be that as it may,\r\nthe intuition of insects, as we now apprehend it, no longer stands\r\nan isolated phenomenon. The lucid cataleptic cannot less directly\r\ncommunicate with the source of truth, as she proves by foreseeing\r\nfuture events.\r\n\r\nIV. The speculations of Berkeley and Boscovich on the non-existence\r\nof matter; and of Kant and others on the arbitrariness of all our\r\nnotions, are interested in, for they appear to be refuted by, the\r\nintuitions of cataleptics. The cataleptic apprehends or perceives\r\ndirectly the objects around her; but they are the same as when realized\r\nthrough her senses. She notices no difference; size, form, colour,\r\ndistance, are elements as real to her now as before. In respect again\r\nto the future, she sees it, but not in the sense of the annihilation\r\nof time; she foresees it; it is the future present to her; time she\r\nmeasures, present and future, with strange precision,—strange, yet an\r\napproximation, instead of this certainty, would have been still more\r\npuzzling.\r\n\r\nSo that it appears that our notions of matter, force, and the like, and\r\nof the conditions of space and time, apart from which we can conceive\r\nnothing, are not figments to suit our human and temporary being, but\r\nelements of eternal truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\n RELIGIOUS DELUSIONS—The seizures giving rise to them shown to\r\n have been forms of trance brought on by fanatical excitement—The\r\n Cevennes—Scenes at the tomb of the Abbé Paris—Revivals in\r\n America—The Ecstatica of Caldaro—Three forms of imputed demoniacal\r\n possession—Witchcraft; its marvels, and the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been occasions, when much excitement on the subject of\r\nreligion has prevailed, and when strange disorders of the nervous\r\nsystem have developed themselves among the people, which have\r\nbeen interpreted as immediate visitings of the Holy Spirit. The\r\ninterpretation was delusive, the belief in it superstition. The effects\r\ndisplayed were neither more nor less than phenomena of trance, the\r\nphysiological consequences of the prevailing excitement. The reader who\r\nhas attentively perused the preceding letters will have no difficulty\r\nin identifying forms of this affection in the varieties of religious\r\nseizures, which, without further comment, I proceed to exemplify.\r\n\r\nEvery one will have met with allusions to some extraordinary scenes\r\nwhich took place in the Cevennes, at the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of the year 1688 that a report was first heard\r\nof a gift of prophecy which had shown itself among the persecuted\r\nfollowers of the Reformation, who, in the south of France, had betaken\r\nthemselves to the mountains. The first instance was said to have\r\noccurred in the family of a glass-dealer of the name of Du Serre, well\r\nknown as the most zealous Calvinist of the neighbourhood, which was a\r\nsolitary spot in Dauphiné, near Mount Peyra. In the enlarging circle\r\nof enthusiasts, Gabriel Astier and Isabella Vincent made themselves\r\nfirst conspicuous. Isabella, a girl of sixteen years of age, from\r\nDauphiné, who was in the service of a peasant, and tended sheep, began\r\nin her sleep to preach and prophesy, and the Reformers came from far\r\nand near to hear her. An advocate of the name of Gerlan describes\r\nthe following scene, which he had witnessed. At his request, she had\r\nadmitted him and a good many others, after nightfall, to a meeting\r\nat a chateau in the neighbourhood. She there disposed herself upon a\r\nbed, shut her eyes, and went to sleep. In her sleep she chanted, in\r\na low tone, the Commandments and a psalm. After a short respite she\r\nbegan to preach, in a louder voice—not in her own dialect, but in good\r\nFrench, which hitherto she had not used. The theme was an exhortation\r\nto obey God rather than man. Sometimes she spoke so quickly as to be\r\nhardly intelligible. At certain of her pauses she stopped to collect\r\nherself. She accompanied her words with gesticulations. Gerlan found\r\nher pulse quiet, her arm not rigid, but relaxed, as natural. After an\r\ninterval, her countenance put on a mocking expression, and she began\r\nanew her exhortation, which was now mixed with ironical reflections\r\nupon the Church of Rome. She then suddenly stopped, continuing asleep.\r\nIt was in vain they stirred her. When her arms were lifted and let\r\ngo, they dropped unconsciously. As several now went away, whom her\r\nsilence rendered impatient, she said in a low tone, but just as if she\r\nwas awake,—“Why do you go away?—why do not you wait till I am ready?”\r\nAnd then she delivered another ironical discourse against the Catholic\r\nChurch. She closed the scene with prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen Bouchier, the intendant of the district, heard of the performances\r\nof Isabella Vincent, he had her brought before him. She replied to\r\nhis interrogatories, that people had often told her that she preached\r\nin her sleep, but that she did not herself believe a word of it. As\r\nthe slightness of her person made her appear younger than she really\r\nwas, the intendant merely sent her to an hospital at Grenoble; where,\r\nnotwithstanding that she was visited by persons of the Reformed\r\npersuasion, there was an end of her preaching—she became a Catholic!\r\n\r\nGabriel Astier, who had been a young labourer, likewise from Dauphiné,\r\nwent, in the capacity of a preacher and prophet, into the valley of\r\nBressac, in the Vivarais. He had infected his family: his father,\r\nmother, elder brother, and sweetheart, followed his example, and took\r\nto prophesying. Gabriel, before he preached, used to fall into a kind\r\nof stupor in which he lay rigid. After delivering his sermon, he would\r\ndismiss his auditors with a kiss, and the words—“My brother, or my\r\nsister, I impart to you the Holy Ghost.” Many believed that they had\r\nthus received the Holy Ghost from Astier, being taken with the same\r\nseizure. During the period of the discourse, first one, then another,\r\nwould fall down: some described themselves afterwards as having felt\r\nfirst a weakness and trembling through the whole frame, and an impulse\r\nto yawn and stretch their arms; then they fell, convulsed and foaming\r\nat the mouth. Others carried the contagion home with them, and first\r\nexperienced its effects, days, weeks, or months afterwards. They\r\nbelieved—nor is it wonderful they did so—that they had received the\r\nHoly Ghost.\r\n\r\nNot less curious were the seizures of the Convulsionnaires at the grave\r\nof the Abbé Paris, in the year 1727. These Jansenist visionaries used\r\nto collect in the churchyard of St. Médard, round the grave of the\r\ndeposed and deceased deacon; and before long, the reputation of the\r\nplace for working miracles getting about, they fell in troops into\r\nconvulsions. They required, to gratify an internal impulse or feeling,\r\nthat the most violent blows should be inflicted upon them at the pit\r\nof the stomach. Carré de Montgeron mentions that, being himself an\r\nenthusiast in the matter, he had inflicted the blows required with\r\nan iron instrument, weighing from twenty to thirty pounds, with a\r\nround head. And as a convulsionary lady complained that he struck too\r\nlightly to relieve the feeling of depression at her stomach, he gave\r\nher sixty blows with all his force. It would not do, and she begged to\r\nhave the instrument used by a tall, strong man, who stood by in the\r\ncrowd. The spasmodic tension of her muscles must have been enormous;\r\nfor she received one hundred blows, delivered with such force that the\r\nwall shook behind her. She thanked the man for his benevolent aid,\r\nand contemptuously censured De Montgeron for his weakness, or want of\r\nfaith, and timidity. It was, indeed, time for issuing the mandate,\r\nwhich, as wit read it, ran—\r\n\r\n    “De par le roi—Défense à Dieu,\r\n    De faire miracle en ce lieu.”\r\n\r\nIn the revivals of modern times, scenes parallel to the above have been\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n“I have seen,” says Mr. Le Roi Sunderland, himself a preacher,\r\n(_Zion’s Watchman_, New York, Oct. 2, 1842,) “persons often ‘lose\r\ntheir strength,’ as it is called, at camp-meetings and other places\r\nof great religious excitement; and not pious people alone, but those,\r\nalso, who were not professors of religion. In the spring of 1824, while\r\nperforming pastoral labour in Dennis, Massachusetts, I saw more than\r\ntwenty affected in this way. Two young men, of the name of Crowell,\r\ncame one day to a prayer-meeting. They were quite indifferent. I\r\nconversed with them freely, but they showed no signs of penitence.\r\nFrom the meeting they went to their shop, (they were shoemakers,) to\r\nfinish some work before going to the meeting in the evening. On seating\r\nthemselves, they were both struck perfectly stiff. I was immediately\r\nsent for, and found them sitting paralyzed” (he means taken with the\r\ninitiatory form of trance-sleep, and possibly cataleptic) “on their\r\nbenches, with their work in their hands, unable to get up, or to move\r\nat all. I have seen scores of persons affected the same way. I have\r\nseen persons lie in this state forty-eight hours. At such times they\r\nare unable to converse, and are sometimes unconscious of what is\r\npassing round them. At the same time, they say they are in a happy\r\nstate of mind.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the same journal portrays another kind of\r\nnervous seizure, as it was manifested at the great revival some forty\r\nyears ago, at Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\n\r\n“The convulsions were commonly called ‘the jerks.’ A writer, (M’Neman)\r\nquoted by Mr. Power, (_Essay on the Influence of the Imagination over\r\nthe Nervous System_,) gives this account of their course and progress:\r\n\r\n“‛At first appearance these meetings exhibited nothing to the spectator\r\nbut a scene of confusion that could scarcely be put into language.\r\nThey were generally opened with a sermon, near the close of which there\r\nwould be an unusual outcry, some bursting out into loud ejaculations of\r\nprayer, &c.\r\n\r\n“‛The rolling exercise consisted in being cast down in a violent\r\nmanner, doubled with the head and feet together, or stretched in a\r\nprostrate manner, turning swiftly over like a dog. Nothing in nature\r\ncould better represent the jerks, than for one to goad another\r\nalternately on every side with a piece of red-hot iron. The exercise\r\ncommonly began in the head, which would fly backwards and forwards, and\r\nfrom side to side, with a quick jolt, which the person would naturally\r\nlabour to suppress, but in vain. He must necessarily go on as he was\r\nstimulated, whether with a violent dash on the ground, and bounce from\r\nplace to place, like a foot-ball; or hopping round, with head, limbs,\r\nand trunk twitching and jolting in every direction, as if they must\r\ninevitably fly asunder,’” &c.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch is from Dow’s journal. In the year 1805 he\r\npreached at Knoxville, Tennessee, before the governor, when some\r\nhundred and fifty persons, among whom were a number of Quakers, had the\r\njerks. “I have seen,” says the writer, “all denominations of religion\r\nexercised by the jerks—gentleman and lady, black and white, young and\r\nold, without exception. I passed a meeting-house, where I observed the\r\nundergrowth had been cut down for camp-meetings, and from fifty to a\r\nhundred saplings were left for the people who were jerked to hold by.\r\nI observed where they had held on they had kicked up the earth, as a\r\nhorse stamping flies.”\r\n\r\nA widely different picture to the above is given in a letter from the\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury to A. M. Phillips, Esq., published in 1841, and\r\ndescribing the state of two _religieuses_, (the Ecstatica of Caldaro,\r\nand the Addolorata of Capriana,) who were visited by members of their\r\nown communion, in the belief that they lay in a sort of heavenly\r\nbeatitude. To this idea their stillness, the devotional attitude of\r\ntheir hands and expression of their countenances, together with their\r\nmanifestation of miraculous intuition, contributed. But I am afraid\r\nthat, to the eye of a physician, their condition would have been simple\r\ntrance. However, while the absence of reasonable enlightenment in the\r\ndisplay is to be regretted, one agreeably recognises the influence of\r\nthe humanity of modern times. Had these young women lived two centuries\r\nago, they would have been the subjects of other discipline, and their\r\nhistory, had I possessed it to quote, must have been transferred to the\r\ndarker section which I have next to enter on.\r\n\r\nThe belief in possession by devils, which existed in the middle ages\r\nand subsequently, embraced several dissimilar cases. The first of them\r\nwhich I will exemplify would have included individuals in the state of\r\nthe _religieuses_ described by Lord Shrewsbury. Behaviour and powers\r\nwhich the people could not understand, even if exhibited by good and\r\nvirtuous persons, and only expressive of or used for right purposes,\r\nwere construed into the operation of unholy influences. The times were\r\nthe reign of terror in religion. I give the following instance:—Marie\r\nBucaille, a native of Normandy, became, towards the year 1700, the\r\nsubject of fits, which ordinarily lasted three or four hours. It\r\nappears, by the depositions of persons of character on her trial,\r\nthat Marie had effected many cures seemingly by her prayers; that she\r\ncomprehended and executed directions given to her mentally; that she\r\nread the thoughts of others. When in the fit, the Curé of Golleville\r\nplaced in the hands of Marie a folded note. Without opening the note,\r\nshe replied to the questions which it contained; and, without knowing\r\nthe writer, she accurately described her person. Although Marie only\r\nemployed her powers to cure the sick and in the service of religion,\r\nshe was not the less condemned to death by the parliament of Valogne.\r\nThe parliament of Rouen mitigated her punishment to whipping and public\r\nignominy.\r\n\r\nA second class, who came nearer to the exact idea of being possessed by\r\ndevils, were persons who were deranged, and entertained something of\r\nthat impression themselves, and avowed it. I am not speaking of single\r\ninstances, but of an extensive popular delusion, or frenzy rather,\r\nwhich prevailed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in parts of\r\nEurope as an epidemic seizure. It was called the wolf-sickness. Those\r\naffected betook themselves to the forests as wild beasts. One of these,\r\nwho was brought before De Lancre, at Bordeaux, in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, was a young man of Besançon. He avowed himself to be\r\nhuntsman of the forest lord, his invisible master. He believed that,\r\nthrough the power of his master, he had been transformed into a wolf;\r\nthat he hunted in the forest as such; and that he was often accompanied\r\nby a bigger wolf, whom he suspected to be the master he served; with\r\nmore details of the same kind. The persons thus affected were called\r\nWehrwolves. Their common fate was the alternative of recovering from\r\ntheir derangement, under the influence of exorcism and its accessories,\r\nor of being executed.\r\n\r\nThe third and proper type of possession by devils presented more\r\ncomplicated features. The patient’s state was not uniform. Often, or\r\nfor the most part, his appearance and behaviour were natural; then\r\nparoxysms would supervene, in which he appeared fierce, malignant,\r\ndemoniacal, in which he believed himself to be possessed, and acted\r\nup to the character, and in which powers, seemingly superhuman, such\r\nas reading the thoughts of others, were manifested by the possessed.\r\nThe explanation of these features is happily given by Dr. Fischer of\r\nBasle, author of an excellent work on Somnambulism. He resolves them,\r\nwith evident justice, into recurrent fits of trance—the patient, when\r\nentranced, being at the same time deranged; and he exemplifies his\r\nhypothesis by the case of a German lady who had fits of trance, in\r\nwhich she fancied herself a French emigrée: it would have been as easy\r\nfor her, had it been the mode, to have fancied herself, and to have\r\nplayed the part of being, possessed by the fiend. The case is this:\r\n\r\nGmelin, in the first volume of his _Contributions to Anthropology_,\r\nnarrates that, in the year 1789, a German lady, under his observation,\r\nhad daily paroxysms, in which she believed herself to be, and acted\r\nthe part of, a French Emigrant. She had been in distress of mind\r\nthrough the absence of a person she was attached to, and he was somehow\r\nimplicated in the scenes of the French Revolution. After an attack of\r\nfever and delirium, the complaint regulated itself, and took the form\r\nof a daily fit of trance-waking. When the time for the fit approached,\r\nshe stopped in her conversation, and ceased to answer when spoken to;\r\nshe then remained a few minutes sitting perfectly still, her eyes fixed\r\non the carpet before her. Then, in evident uneasiness, she began to\r\nmove her head backwards and forwards, to sigh and to pass her fingers\r\nacross her eyebrows. This lasted a minute; then she raised her eyes,\r\nlooked once or twice round with timidity and embarrassment, then began\r\nto talk in French, when she would describe all the particulars of her\r\nescape from France, and, assuming the manner of a French woman, talk\r\npurer and better accented French than she had been known to be capable\r\nof talking before, correct her friends when they spoke incorrectly, but\r\ndelicately, and with a comment on the German rudeness of laughing at\r\nthe bad pronunciation of strangers: and if led herself to speak or read\r\nGerman, she used a French accent, and spoke it ill; and the like.\r\n\r\nWe have by this time had intercourse enough with spirits and demons to\r\nprepare us for the final subject of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThe superstition of witchcraft stretches back into remote antiquity,\r\nand has many roots. In Europe it is partly of Druidical origin. The\r\nDruidesses were part priestesses, part shrewd old ladies, who dealt\r\nin magic and medicine. They were called _allrune_, all-knowing. There\r\nwas some touch of classical superstition mingled in the stream which\r\nwas flowing down to us; so an edict of a Council of Trêves, in the\r\nyear 1310, has this injunction:—“Nulla mulierum se nocturnis horis\r\nequitare cum Dianâ profiteatur; hæc enim dæmoniaca est illusio.” But\r\nthe main source from which we derived this superstition is the East,\r\nand traditions and facts incorporated in our religion. There were\r\nonly wanted the ferment of thought of the fifteenth century, the\r\nenergy, ignorance, enthusiasm, and faith of those days, and the papal\r\ndenunciation of witchcraft by the Bull of Innocent the Eighth, in 1459,\r\nto give fury to the delusion. And from this time, for three centuries,\r\nthe flames at which more than a hundred thousand victims perished cast\r\na lurid light over Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the fires are out—the superstition is extinct—and its history is\r\ntrite, and has lost all interest; so I will hasten to the one point in\r\nit which deserves, which indeed requires, explanation.\r\n\r\nI do not advert to the late duration of the belief in witchcraft—so\r\nlate, that it is but a century this very month of January since\r\nthe last witch, a lady and a sub-prioress, whose confession I will\r\nafterwards give, was executed in Germany; while, at the same period,\r\na strong effort was made in Scotland, by good and conscientious, and\r\notherwise sensible persons, to reanimate the embers of the delusion, as\r\nis shown by the following evidence. In February, 1743, the Associate\r\nPresbytery, meaning the Presbytery of the Secession or Seceders,\r\n(from the Scottish Established Church,) passed, and soon thereafter\r\npublished, an act for renewing the National Covenant, in which there is\r\na solemn acknowledgment of sins, and vow to renounce them; among which\r\nsins is specified “the repeal of the penal statutes against witchcraft,\r\ncontrary to the express laws of God, and for which a holy God may\r\nbe provoked, in a way of righteous judgment, to leave those who are\r\nalready ensnared to be hardened more and more, and to permit Satan to\r\ntempt and seduce others to the same wicked and dangerous snare.”—(Note,\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, January, 1847.)\r\n\r\nNor is the marvel in the absolute belief of the people in witchcraft\r\nonly two centuries ago: what could they do but believe, when the\r\nwitches and sorcerers themselves, before their execution, often avowed\r\ntheir guilt and told how they had laid themselves out to league with\r\nthe evil spirit; how they had gone through a regular process of\r\ninitiation in the black art; how they had been rebaptized with the\r\nsupport of regular witch-sponsors; how they had abjured Christ, and had\r\nentered, to the best of their belief, into a compact with the Devil,\r\nand had commenced accordingly a suitable course of bad works, poisoning\r\nand bewitching men and cattle, and the like?\r\n\r\nNor is the wonder in the unfairness with which those accused of\r\nwitchcraft were treated. So at Lindheim, Horst reports on one occasion\r\nsix women were implicated in a charge of having disinterred the body of\r\na child to make a witchbroth. As they happened to be innocent of the\r\ndeed, they underwent the most cruel tortures before they would confess\r\nit. At length they saw their cheapest bargain was to admit the crime,\r\nand be simply burned alive, and have it over. They did so. But the\r\nhusband of one of them procured an official examination of the grave,\r\nwhen the child’s body was found in its coffin safe and sound. What said\r\nthe Inquisitor? “This is indeed a proper piece of devil’s work: no, no,\r\nI am not to be taken in by such a gross and obvious imposture. Luckily\r\nthe women have already confessed the crime, and burned they must and\r\nshall be, in honour of the Holy Trinity, which has commanded the\r\nextirpation of sorcerers and witches.” The six women were burned alive\r\naccordingly; for the people had fits of frenzied terror, which required\r\nto be allayed by the sacrifice of a victim or two, and Justice became\r\nconfused: to be sure, in those days her head was never very clear, and\r\nthrew by mistake the odium of the crime into the accusing scale; the\r\nother flew up significantly of the full extent to which mercy could\r\ninterfere to temper the law. A curious instance of an epidemic attack\r\nof the belief in witchcraft occurred at Salzburg between the years\r\n1627 and 1629, originating in a sickness among the cattle in the\r\nneighbourhood. The sickness was unluckily attributed to witchcraft,\r\nand an active inquiry was set on foot to detect the participators in\r\nthe crime. It was very successful; for we find in the list of persons\r\nburned alive on this occasion, besides children of 14, 12, 11, 10,\r\n9 years of age, fourteen canons, four gentlemen of the choir, two\r\nyoung men of rank, a fat old lady of rank, the wife of a burgomaster,\r\na counsellor, the fattest burgess of Würtzburg, together with his\r\nwife, the handsomest woman in the city, and a midwife of the name of\r\nShiekelte, with whom (according to a N. B. in the original report) the\r\nwhole of the mischief originated.\r\n\r\nThe marvel in witchcraft is the belief entertained by the sorcerers\r\nand witches themselves of its reality. That many of these persons,\r\nshrewd and unprincipled, should have pretended an implicit belief in\r\ntheir art, till they were brought to justice, is only what is still\r\noccasionally done in modern times. But that they should, as it is\r\nproved by some of their confessions previous to execution, have been\r\ntheir own dupes, and have entertained no doubt whatsoever of the\r\nreality of their intercourse with the devil, is surprising enough to\r\ndeserve explanation. A single crucial instance will bring us upon the\r\ntrail of the solution.\r\n\r\nA little maid, twelve years of age, used to fall into fits of sleep;\r\nand afterwards she told her parents and the judge how an old woman\r\nand her daughter, riding on a broomstick, had come and taken her out\r\nwith them. The daughter sat foremost, the old woman behind, the little\r\nmaid between. They went away through the roof of the house, over the\r\nadjoining houses and the towngate, to a village some way off. Upon\r\narriving there, the party went down the chimney of a cottage into a\r\nroom, where sat a black man and twelve women. They eat and drank. The\r\nblack man filled their glasses from a can, and gave each of the women a\r\nhandful of gold. She herself had received none, but she had eaten and\r\ndrunk with them.\r\n\r\nSee how much this example displays. I mean not that the superstition\r\nwas imbibed in childhood, though that would do much to establish the\r\nbelief in it, but that it had power to disturb the mind sufficiently\r\nto produce trance-sleep; for such were evidently the fits of sleep\r\nthis child described; and trance-sleep, with its special character of\r\nvisions, of dreams vivid, coherent, continuous, realizing the ideas\r\nwhich had driven the mind into trance. Elder persons, it is to be\r\npresumed, were occasionally similarly wrought upon. And the witches\r\nseemed to have known and availed themselves of the confidence in their\r\nart that could be thus promoted; and by witchbroths, of which narcotics\r\nformed an ingredient, they would induce in themselves and in their\r\npupils a heavy stupor, which so far resembles trance that vivid and\r\nconnected dreams occur in it. Here was the seeming reality necessary\r\nfor absolute belief. It lay in not understood trance-phenomena. Other\r\nevidence from the same source came in to support the first. Some of the\r\nwitch-pupils in their trances would show a strange knowledge; some of\r\nthe victims, on whose fears or persons they had wrought, would become\r\npossessed—proving their art to be not less real than they believed thus\r\nthe elementary part to be of their personal communication with the\r\nfiend. These remarks explain collaterally why witches and sorceresses\r\nwere more numerous than sorcerers and magicians. Insufficient\r\noccupation and other causes helped probably to dispose women to seek a\r\nresource in the intense excitement of this crime; but besides, trance\r\nstood at their service, which men seldomer experience.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with two pictures. One, the confession—interesting,\r\nhowever, from its relation to the child’s early vision—of vulgar and\r\nordinary witches; the other, the substance of the confession of a\r\nlady-witch, which, in itself, tells the whole curious tale of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAt Mora, in Sweden, in 1669, of many who were put to the torture and\r\nexecuted, seventy-two women agreed in the following avowal: That they\r\nwere in the habit of meeting at a place called Blocula. That on their\r\ncalling out “Come forth,” the Devil used to appear to them in a gray\r\ncoat, red breeches, gray stockings, with a red beard, and a peaked hat\r\nwith parti-coloured feathers on his head. He then enforced upon them,\r\nnot without blows, that they must bring him, at nights, their own and\r\nother people’s children, stolen for the purpose. They travel through\r\nthe air to Blocula either on beasts, or on spits, or broomsticks. When\r\nthey have many children with them, they rig on an additional spar to\r\nlengthen the back of the goat or their broomstick, that the children\r\nmay have room to sit. At Blocula they sign their name in blood, and are\r\nbaptized. The Devil is a humorous, pleasant gentleman; but his table is\r\ncoarse enough, which makes the children often sick on their way home,\r\nthe product being the so-called witch-butter found in the fields. When\r\nthe Devil is larky, he solicits the witches to dance round him on their\r\nbrooms, which he suddenly pulls from under them, and uses to beat them\r\nwith, till they are black and blue. He laughs at this joke till his\r\nsides shake again. Sometimes he is in a more gracious mood, and plays\r\nto them lovely airs upon the harp; and occasionally sons and daughters\r\nare born to the Devil, which take up their residence at Blocula.\r\n\r\nThe following is the history of the lady-witch. She was, at the\r\ntime of her death, seventy years of age, and had been many years\r\nsub-prioress of the convent of Unterzell, near Würtzburg.\r\n\r\nMaria Renata took the veil at nineteen years of age, against her\r\ninclination, having previously been initiated in the mysteries of\r\nwitchcraft, which she continued to practise for fifty years, under the\r\ncloak of punctual attendance to discipline and pretended piety. She was\r\nlong in the station of sub-prioress, and would, for her capacity, have\r\nbeen promoted to the rank of prioress, had she not betrayed a certain\r\ndiscontent with the ecclesiastical life, a certain contrariety to her\r\nsuperiors, something half expressed only of inward dissatisfaction.\r\nRenata had not ventured to let any one about the convent into her\r\nconfidence, and she remained free from suspicion, notwithstanding that,\r\nfrom time to time, some of the nuns, either from the herbs she mixed\r\nwith their food, or through sympathy, had strange seizures, of which\r\nsome died. Renata became at length extravagant and unguarded in her\r\nwitch-propensities, partly from long security, partly from desire of\r\nstronger excitement—made noises in the dormitory, and uttered shrieks\r\nin the garden; went at nights into the cells of the nuns to pinch and\r\ntorment them, to assist her in which she kept a considerable supply of\r\ncats. The removal of the keys of the cells counteracted this annoyance;\r\nbut a still more efficient means was a determined blow, on the part of\r\na nun, struck at the aggressor with the penitential scourge one night,\r\non the morning following which Renata was observed to have a black\r\neye and cut face. This event awakened suspicion against Renata. Then\r\none of the nuns, who was much esteemed, declared, believing herself\r\nupon her death-bed, that, “as she shortly expected to stand before\r\nher Maker, Renata was uncanny; that she had often at nights been\r\nvisibly tormented by her, and that she warned her to desist from this\r\ncourse.” General alarm arose, and apprehension of Renata’s arts; and\r\none of the nuns, who previously had had fits, now became possessed,\r\nand, in the paroxysms, told the wildest tales against Renata. It is\r\nonly wonderful how the sub-prioress contrived to keep her ground so\r\nmany years against these suspicions and incriminations. She adroitly\r\nput aside the insinuations of the nun as imaginary, or of calumnious\r\nintention, and treated witchcraft and possession of the Devil as things\r\nwhich enlightened people no longer believed in. As, however, five more\r\nof the nuns, either taking the infection from the first, or influenced\r\nby the arts of Renata, became possessed of devils, and unanimously\r\nattacked Renata, the superiors could no longer avoid making a serious\r\ninvestigation of the charges. Renata was confined to a cell alone,\r\nwhereupon the six devils screeched in chorus at being deprived of their\r\nfriend. She had begged to be allowed to take her papers with her; but\r\nthis being refused, and thinking herself detected, she at once avowed\r\nto her confessor and the superiors that she was a witch, had learned\r\nwitchcraft out of the convent, and had bewitched the six nuns. They\r\ndetermined to keep the matter secret, and to attempt the conversion of\r\nRenata. And, as the nuns still continued possessed, they despatched\r\nher to a remote convent. Here, under a show of outward piety, she\r\nstill went on with her attempts to realize witchcraft, and the nuns\r\nremained possessed. It was decided at length to give Renata over to the\r\ncivil power. She was accordingly condemned to be burned alive; but in\r\nmitigation of punishment, her head was first struck off. Four of the\r\npossessed nuns gradually recovered, with clerical assistance—the other\r\ntwo remained deranged. Renata was executed on the 21st January, 1749.\r\n\r\nRenata stated, in her voluntary confession, that she had often, at\r\nnight, been carried bodily to witch-sabbaths, in one of which she was\r\nfirst presented to the Prince of Darkness, when she abjured God and\r\nthe Virgin at the same time. Her name, with the alteration of Maria\r\ninto Emma, was written in a black book, and she herself was stamped on\r\nthe back as the Devil’s property; in return for which she received the\r\npromise of seventy years of life, and of all she might wish for. She\r\nstated that she had often at night gone into the cellar of the chateau\r\nand drank the best wine; in the shape of a sow had walked on the\r\nconvent walls; on the bridge had milked the cows as they passed over;\r\nand several times had mingled with the actors in the theatre in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\n MESMERISM.—Use of chloroform—History of Mesmer—The true nature\r\n and extent of his discovery—Its applications to medicine and\r\n surgery—Various effects produced by mesmeric manipulations—Hysteric\r\n seizures—St. Veitz’s dance—Nervous paralysis—Catochus—Initiatory\r\n trance—The order in which the higher trance phenomena are afterwards\r\n generally drawn out.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan no further use be made of the facts and principles we have thus\r\nseen verified and established, than to explain a class of delusions\r\nwhich prevailed in times of ignorance? The powers which we have seen\r\nsuccessfully employed to shake the nerves and unsettle the mind in\r\nthe service of superstition, can they not be skilfully turned to some\r\npurpose beneficial to society?\r\n\r\nA satisfactory answer to the question may be found in the invention of\r\nether-inhalation, and in the history of mesmerism. The witch narcotized\r\nher pupils in order to produce in them delusive visions; the surgeon\r\nstupefies his patient to annul the pain of an operation. The fanatic\r\npreacher excites convulsions and trance in his auditory as evidence of\r\nthe working of the Holy Spirit; Mesmer produced the same effects in his\r\npatients as a means of curing disease.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr. Jackson, a chemist of the United States, that\r\nit might be possible harmlessly to stupefy a patient through the\r\ninhalation of the vapour of sulphuric ether, to such an extent that a\r\nsurgical operation would be unfelt by him. He communicated the idea to\r\nMr. Morton, a dentist, who carried it into execution with the happiest\r\nresults. The patient became insensible; a tooth was extracted; no pain\r\nseemed felt at the time, or was remembered afterwards, and no ill\r\nconsequences followed. Led by the report of this success, in the course\r\nof the autumn of 1846, Messrs. Bigelow, Warren, and Heywood, ventured\r\nto employ the same means in surgical operations of a more serious\r\ndescription. The results obtained on these occasions were not less\r\nsatisfactory than the first had been. Since then, in England, France,\r\nand Germany, the same interesting experiment has been repeated many\r\nhundred times, and the adoption of this, or of a parallel method, has\r\nbecome general in surgery.\r\n\r\nI withdraw from the present Letter a sketch which I had made from the\r\n“report” of Dr. Heyfelder, of the phenomena of etherization; for a\r\nyear had barely elapsed, when the narcotizing agent recommended by Mr.\r\nJackson was superseded by another, suggested and brought into use by\r\nProfessor Simpson of Edinburgh. The inhalation of chloroform is found\r\nto be more rapid, uniform, and certain in its effects, and compassable\r\nin a simpler manner, than the inhalation of ether. Its brief phenomena\r\nare wound up by the production of stupor; they are remotely comparable\r\nto those produced by alcohol. Alas! the time is passed when I enjoyed\r\nthe means of looking through, and forming a practical judgment upon\r\ndiscoveries like the present. Not the less, however, do I hail the\r\nadvent of this as a boon to the art of surgery. The conception was\r\noriginal, bold and reasonable; its execution neat and scientific; its\r\nsuccess wonderful. It established in the year 1847, to the satisfaction\r\nof the public and of the medical profession, that the exclusion of pain\r\nfrom surgical operations is a practicable idea, and the attempt to\r\nrealize it a legitimate pursuit.\r\n\r\nThen, what is Mesmerism?\r\n\r\nThe object of the inventor of the art was to cure diseases through the\r\ninfluence of a new force brought by him to bear upon the human frame.\r\n\r\nTalent, for philosophy or business, is the power of seeing what is\r\nyet hidden from others. As the eyes of some animals are fitted to\r\nsee best in the dark, so the mental vision of some original minds\r\nprefers exercising itself on obscure and occult subjects. Whoever\r\nindulges this turn will certainly pass for a charlatan; most likely\r\nhe will prove one. Mesmer had it, and indulged it, in a high degree.\r\nThe body of science which I have unfolded in the preceding Letters\r\nwas wholly unknown in his time, (he was born in 1734;) but he was\r\nled by his wayward instinct to grope after it in the dark, and he\r\nseized and brought to upper light fragmentary elements of strange\r\ncapabilities, which he strove to interpret and to use. He had early\r\ndisplayed a bias towards the mystical. When a student at Vienna, (he\r\nwas by birth a Swiss,) his principal study was astrology. He sought in\r\nthe stars a force which, extending throughout space, might influence\r\nthe beings living upon our planet. In the year 1766 he published his\r\nlucubrations. In attempting to identify his imaginary force, Mesmer\r\nfirst supposed it to be electricity. Afterwards, about the year 1773,\r\nhe adopted the idea that it must be magnetism. So at Vienna, from 1773\r\nto 1775, he employed the practice of stroking diseased parts of the\r\nbody with magnets. But in 1776, happening to be upon a tour, he fell in\r\nwith a mystical monk of the name of Gassner, who was then occupied in\r\ncuring the Prince-Bishop of Ratisbon of blindness, by exorcism. Then\r\nMesmer observed that, without magnets, Gassner produced much the same\r\neffects on the living body which he had produced with them. The fact\r\nwas not lost upon him: he threw aside his magnets, and operated mostly\r\nafterwards with the hand alone. It appears that he was often successful\r\nin curing disease, or that his patients not only experienced sensible\r\neffects from his procedures, but frequently recovered from their\r\ncomplaints. But in 1777, his reputation, which must have always hung\r\nupon a very slender thread, broke down through a failure in the case\r\nof the musician Paradies. So Mesmer left Vienna, and in the following\r\nyear betook himself to Paris. There he obtained a success which quickly\r\ndrew upon him the indignation, perhaps the jealousy, of the Faculty,\r\nwho failed not to stigmatize him as a charlatan. They exclaimed against\r\nhim for practising an art which he would not divulge; and when he\r\noffered to display it, averred that he threw difficulties in the way of\r\ntheir investigations. Perhaps he suspected them of want of fairness\r\nin their inquiries; perhaps he was really unwilling to part with his\r\nsecret. He refused an offer from the Government of 20,000 francs if he\r\nwould disclose it; but he communicated freely to individuals, under a\r\npledge of secrecy, all he knew for a hundred louis. His practice itself\r\ngave most support to the allegations against him. His patients were\r\nreceived with an air of mystery and studied effect. The apartment,\r\nhung with mirrors, was dimly lighted. A profound silence was observed,\r\nbroken only by strains of music, which occasionally floated through the\r\nrooms. The patients were seated round a sort of vat, which contained\r\na heterogeneous mixture of chemical ingredients. With this, and with\r\neach other, they were placed in relation by means of cords, or jointed\r\nrods, or by holding hands; and among them slowly and mysteriously moved\r\nMesmer himself, affecting one by a touch, another by a look, a third by\r\npasses with his hand, a fourth by pointing with a rod.\r\n\r\nWhat followed is easily conceivable from the scenes referred to in\r\nmy last letter as witnessed at religious revivals. One person became\r\nhysterical, then another; one was seized with catalepsy; others with\r\nconvulsions; some with palpitations of the heart, perspirations,\r\nand other bodily disturbances. These effects, however various and\r\ndifferent, went all by the name of “salutary crisis.” The method was\r\nsupposed to provoke in the sick person exactly the kind of action\r\npropitious to his recovery. And it may easily be imagined that many\r\na patient found himself the better after a course of this rude\r\nempiricism, and that the effect made by these events passing daily in\r\nParis must have been very considerable. To the ignorant the scene was\r\nfull of wonderment.\r\n\r\nTo ourselves, regarding it from our present vantage-ground, it presents\r\nno marvellous characters. The phenomena were the same which we have\r\nbeen recently contemplating—a group of disorders of the nervous system.\r\nThe causes which were present are not less familiar to us, nor their\r\ncapability of producing such effects; they were—mental excitement,\r\nhere consisting in raised expectation and fear; the contagiousness\r\nof hysteria, convulsions, and trance, its force increased by the\r\nnumbers and close-packing of the patients; the Od force, developed\r\nby the chemical action in the charged caldron, developed by each of\r\nthe excited bodies around, its action first favoured by the absolute\r\nstillness observed, then by the increasing sensibility of the patients\r\nas their nerves became more and more shaken. It is remarkable that\r\nJussieu—the most competent judge in the commission of inquiry into the\r\ntruth of mesmerism, set on foot at Paris in 1784, of which Franklin\r\nwas a member, and which condemned mesmerism as an imposture—was so\r\nstruck with what he saw, that he strongly recommended the subject to\r\nthe attention and study of physicians. His objections were against the\r\ntheory alone. He laid it down in the separate report which he gave in,\r\nthat no physical cause had been proved to be in operation beyond animal\r\nheat! curiously overlooking the fact that common heat would not produce\r\nthe effects observed; and, therefore, that the latter must have been\r\nowing to that something which animal heat, or the radiating warmth of\r\na living body, contains, in addition to common heat. That something we\r\nnow know, but only since 1845, to be the Od force.\r\n\r\nThe Od force is so new, so young in science, that Mesmer’s reputation\r\nhas not yet been credited with the honour thence reflected upon it.\r\nI will not say that Mesmer’s astral force was a distinct anticipation\r\nof Von Reichenbach’s discovery, which was noways suggested by the\r\nformer, and was from first to last an effort of inductive observation.\r\nBut the guess of the mystic had certainly a most happy parallelism to\r\nthe truth, which a different sort of mind tracked in the same field;\r\nfor the Od force reaches us even from the stars, and the sun and the\r\nfixed stars are Od-negative; and the planets and the moon Od-positive.\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow Mesmer through his minor performances.\r\nThe relief sometimes obtained by stroking diseased parts with the\r\nhand—that is, the effects obtained through the local action of Od—had\r\nbeen before proclaimed by Dr. Greatrex, whose pretensions had had no\r\nless an advocate than the Honourable Robert Boyle. The extraordinary\r\ntales of Mesmer’s personal power over individuals are probably part\r\nexaggeration, part real results of his confidence and skill in the use\r\nof the means he wielded. Mesmer died in 1815.\r\n\r\nAmong his pupils, when at the zenith of his fame, was the Marquis\r\nde Puységur. Returning from serving at the siege of Gibraltar, this\r\nyoung officer found mesmerism the mode at Paris, and appears to have\r\nbecome, for no other reason, one of the initiated. At the end of a\r\ncourse of instruction, he professed himself to be no wiser than when it\r\nbegan; and he ridiculed the credulity of his brothers, who were stanch\r\nadherents of the new doctrine. However, he did not forget his lesson;\r\nand on going the same spring to his estate at Besancy, near Soissons,\r\nhe took occasion to mesmerize the daughter of his agent and another\r\nyoung person, for the toothache, and they declared themselves, in a\r\nfew minutes, cured. This questionable success was sufficient to lead\r\nM. de Puységur, a few days after, to try his hand on a young peasant\r\nof the name of Victor, who was suffering with a severe fluxion on his\r\nchest. What was M. de Puységur’s surprise, when, at the end of a few\r\nminutes, Victor went off into a kind of tranquil sleep, without crisis\r\nor convulsion, and in that sleep began to gesticulate and talk, and\r\nenter into his private affairs. Then he became sad; and M. de Puységur\r\ntried mentally to inspire him with cheerful thoughts; he hummed a\r\nlively tune to himself inaudibly, and immediately Victor began to sing\r\nthe air. Victor remained asleep for an hour, and awoke composed, with\r\nhis symptoms mitigated.\r\n\r\nThe case of Victor revolutionized the art of mesmerism. The large\r\npart of his life, in which M. de Puységur had nothing to do but to\r\nfollow this vein of inquiry, was occupied in practising and advocating\r\na gentle manipulation to produce sleep, in preference to the more\r\nexciting means which led to the violent crises in Mesmer’s art. I\r\nhave no plea for telling how M. de Puységur served in the first\r\nFrench revolutionary armies; how he quitted the service in disgust;\r\nhow narrowly he escaped the guillotine; how he lived in retirement\r\nafterwards, benevolently endeavouring to do good to his sick neighbours\r\nby means of mesmerism; how he survived the Restoration; and how,\r\nfinally, he died of a cold caught by serving in the encampment at\r\nRheims, at the coronation of Charles X.\r\n\r\nFor he had fulfilled his mission the day that he put Victor to sleep.\r\nHe had made a vast stride in advance of his teacher. Not but that\r\nMesmer must frequently have induced the same condition; but he had\r\npassed it by unheeded as one only of numerous equivalent forms of\r\nsalutary crises; or that M. de Puységur himself estimated, or had the\r\nmeans of estimating, the real nature and value of the step which he\r\nhad made. To himself he appeared to be winning a larger domain for\r\nmesmerism, when in fact he had emerged into an independent field, into\r\nwhich mesmerism happened to have a gate.\r\n\r\nThe state which he had induced in Victor was common trance, the\r\ninitiatory sleep, followed by half-waking. He had obtained this result\r\nby using the Od force with quietness and gentleness, leaving out the\r\nexciting mental agencies to which the mixture of violent seizures\r\nin Mesmer’s practice is attributable. The gentler method has been\r\nadopted and practised by the successors of M. de Puységur, by Deleuze,\r\nBertrand, Georget, Rostan, Foissac, Elliotson, and others. To Dr.\r\nElliotson, the most successful probably, certainly the most scientific\r\nemployer of the practice of mesmerism, the credit is due of having\r\nintroduced its use into England: the credit,—for it required no little\r\nmoral courage to encounter the storm of opposition with which his\r\nhonest zeal in the advocacy of an unpopular practical truth was met. It\r\nis but fair to add, that though his theory has been superseded, and his\r\nmethod changed, to Mesmer belongs the merit of having first tracked out\r\nand realized this path of discovery. The golden medal is his.\r\n\r\nThe modern practice of mesmerism contemplates two objects: one, the\r\napplication of the Od force to produce local effects; the other, its\r\nemployment to induce trance. In the present slight sketch I shall\r\nsay nothing on the first subject; but let me describe how trance is\r\ninduced. It is to be observed, that attention to certain conditions\r\nfavours very much the success of the experiment. The room should not\r\nbe too light; very few persons should be present; the patient and\r\nthe operator should be quiet, tranquil, and composed; the patient\r\nshould be fasting. The operator has then only to sit down before the\r\npatient, who is likewise sitting with his hands resting on his knees,\r\nand gently closed, with the thumbs upwards. The operator then lays his\r\nhands half-open upon the patient’s, pressing the thumbs against those\r\nof the patient, as it were taking thumbs: this is a more convenient\r\nattitude than taking hands in the ordinary way. The operator and\r\npatient have then only to sit still. An Od-current is established; and\r\nif the patient is susceptible, he will soon become drowsy, and perhaps\r\nbe entranced at the first sitting. Instead of this, the two hands of\r\nthe operator may be held horizontally with the fingers pointed to the\r\npatient’s forehead, and either maintained in this position, or brought\r\ndownwards in frequent passes opposite to the patient’s face, shoulders,\r\narms; the points of the fingers being held as near the patient as\r\npossible without touching.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, theoretically, to explain the beneficial results which\r\nfollow from the daily induction of trance for an hour or so, in\r\nvarious forms of disorder of the nervous system,—in epilepsy,—in\r\ntic-doloreux,—in nervous palsy, and the like. As long as the state\r\nof trance is maintained, so long is the nervous system in a state of\r\nrepose. It is more or less completely put out of gear. It experiences\r\nthe same relief which a sprained joint feels when you dispose it in a\r\nrelaxed position on a pillow. A chance is thus given to the strained\r\nnerves of recovering their tone of health; and it is wonderful how many\r\ncases of nervous disorder get well at once through these simple means.\r\nAs it is certain that there is no disease in which the nervous system\r\nis not primarily or secondarily implicated, it is impossible to foresee\r\nwhat will prove the limit to the beneficial application of mesmerism in\r\nmedical practice.\r\n\r\nIn operative surgery the art is not less available. In trance the\r\npatient is insensible, and a limb may be removed without the operation\r\nexciting disturbance of any kind. And what is equally important, in\r\nall the after-treatment, at every dressing, the process of mesmerizing\r\nmay be resorted to again, with no possible disadvantage, but being\r\nrather soothing and useful to the patient, independently of the\r\nextinction of the dread and suffering of pain. The first instance in\r\nwhich an operation was performed on a patient in this state was the\r\ncelebrated case of Madame Plantin. It occurred twenty years ago. The\r\nlady was sixty-four years of age, and laboured under scirrhus of the\r\nbreast. She was prepared for the operation by M. Chapélain, who on\r\nseveral successive days threw her into trance by the ordinary mesmeric\r\nmanipulations. She was _then_ like an ordinary sleep-walker, and would\r\nconverse with indifference about the contemplated operation, the idea\r\nof which, when she was in her natural state, filled her with terror.\r\nThe operation of removing the diseased breast was performed at Paris\r\non the 12th of April, 1829, by M. Jules Cloquet; it lasted from ten\r\nto twelve minutes. During the whole of this time the patient, _in\r\nher trance_, conversed calmly with M. Cloquet, and exhibited not the\r\nslightest sign of suffering. Her expression of countenance did not\r\nchange; nor was the voice, the breathing, or the pulse at all affected.\r\nAfter the wound was dressed, the patient was awakened from the trance,\r\nwhen on learning that the operation was over, and seeing her children\r\nround her, Madame Plantin was affected with considerable emotion,\r\nwhereupon M. Chapélain, to compose her, put her back into the state of\r\ntrance.\r\n\r\nI copy the above particulars from Dr. Foissac’s _Rapports et\r\nDiscussions de l’Académie Royale de Médecine sur le Magnetism\r\nAnimal_.—Paris, 1833. My friend, Dr. Warren, of Boston, informed me\r\nthat, being at Paris, he had asked M. Jules Cloquet if the story were\r\ntrue. M. Cloquet answered, “Perfectly.” “Then why,” said Dr. Warren,\r\n“have you not repeated the practice?” M. Cloquet replied “that he had\r\nnot dared; that the prejudice against mesmerism was so strong at Paris\r\nthat he probably would have lost his reputation and his income by so\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that in ordinary trance the mind appears to gain\r\nnew powers. For a long time we had to trust to the chance turning up\r\nof cases of spontaneous trance, in the experience of physicians of\r\nobservation, for any light we could hope would be thrown on those\r\nextraordinary phenomena; now we possess around us, on every side,\r\nadequate opportunities for completely elucidating these events, if we\r\nplease to employ them. The philosopher, when his speculations suggest a\r\nnew question to be put, can summon the attendance of a trance as easily\r\nas the Jupiter of the Iliad summoned a dream; or, looking out for two\r\nor three cases to which the induction of trance may be beneficial, the\r\nphysician may have in his house subjects for perpetual reference and\r\ndaily experiment.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, with whom I, have long been well acquainted, for many\r\nyears chairman of the Quarter Sessions in a northern county, of which\r\nduring a late year he was high sheriff, has, like M. de Puységur,\r\namused some of his leisure hours, and benevolently done not a little\r\ngood, by taking the trouble of mesmerizing invalids, whom he has thus\r\nrestored to health. In constant correspondence with, and occasionally\r\nhaving the pleasure of seeing this gentleman, I have learned from him\r\nthe common course in which the new powers of the mind, which belong to\r\ntrance, are developed under its artificial induction. The sketch which\r\nI propose to give of this subject will be taken from his descriptions,\r\nwhich, I should observe, tally in all essential points with what I meet\r\nwith in French and German authors. The little that I have myself seen\r\nof the matter, I will mention preliminarily.\r\n\r\nIn some, instead of trance, a common fit of hysterics is produced; in\r\nothers, slight headache, and a sense of weight on the eyebrows, and\r\ndifficulty of raising the eyelids, supervene.\r\n\r\nIn one young woman, whom I saw mesmerised for the first time by\r\nDupotet, nothing resulted but a sense of pricking and tingling wherever\r\nhe pointed with his hand; and her arm, on one or two occasions, jumped\r\nin the most natural and conclusive manner when, her eyes being covered,\r\nhe directed his outstretched finger to it.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, about thirty years of age, when the mesmeriser held his\r\noutstretched hands pointed to his head, experienced no disposition to\r\nsleep; but in two or three minutes he began to shake his head and twist\r\nhis features about; at last, his head was jerked from side to side, and\r\nforwards and backwards, with a violence that looked alarming. But he\r\nsaid, when it was over, that the motion had not been unpleasant; that\r\nhe had moved in a sort voluntarily—although he could not refrain from\r\nit. If the hands of the operator were pointed to his arm instead of\r\nhis head, the same violent jerks ensued, and gradually extended to the\r\nwhole body. I asked him to try to resist the influence, by holding his\r\narm out in strong muscular tension. This had the effect of retarding\r\nthe attack of the jerks, but, when it came on, it was more violent\r\nthan usual. I have lately seen another similar case. The seizure is\r\nevidently a form of St. Veitz’s dance brought out by the operation of\r\nthe Od force. In neither of these two cases could trance be induced.\r\n\r\nA servant of mine, aged about twenty-five, was mesmerized by\r\nLafontaine, for a full half-hour, and, no effect appearing to be\r\nproduced, I told him he might rise from the chair and leave us.\r\nOn getting up he looked uneasy, and said his arms were numb. They\r\nwere perfectly paralyzed from the elbows downwards, and numb to the\r\nshoulders. This was the more satisfactory, that neither the man\r\nhimself, nor Lafontaine, nor the four or five spectators, expected\r\nthis result. The operator triumphantly drew a pin and stuck it into\r\nthe man’s hand, which bled, but had no feeling. Then heedlessly, to\r\nshow it gave pain, Lafontaine stuck the pin into the man’s thigh, whose\r\nflashing eye, and half suppressed growl, denoted that the aggression\r\nwould certainly have been returned by another, had the arm which should\r\nhave done it not been really powerless. However, M. Lafontaine made\r\npeace with the man, by restoring him the use and feeling of his arms.\r\nThis was done by dusting them, as it were, by quick transverse motions\r\nof his extended hands. In five minutes nothing remained of the palsy\r\nbut a slight stiffness, which gradually wore off in the course of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOccasionally partial tonic spasm (improperly termed catalepsy, for\r\nit is of the nature of catochus, and the rigidity attending it is\r\nabsolute) supervenes as the only consequence of mesmerising a limb.\r\nThis result, which is not less alarming to the patient who has not been\r\nled to expect it than the preceding, may be got rid of in the same\r\nway. If you point with your fingers to the rigid muscles, or again, as\r\nit were, dust the limb with brisk transverse passes, or breathe upon\r\nit, the stiffness is thawed and disappears. Trance is seldom induced\r\nby mesmeric passes without more or less partial muscular rigidity of\r\nthis kind supervening; it always yields to the means which have been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nGenuine and ordinary trance I have seen produced by the same\r\nmanipulations in from three minutes to half-an-hour. The patient’s\r\neyelids have dropped, he has appeared on the point of sleeping, but\r\nhe has not sunk back upon his chair; then he has continued to sit\r\nupright—seemingly perfectly insensible to the loudest sounds, or the\r\nacutest and most startling impressions on the sense of touch. The pulse\r\nis commonly a little increased in frequency; the breathing is sometimes\r\nheavier than usual.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as in Victor’s case, the patient quickly and\r\nspontaneously emerges from the state of trance-sleep into trance\r\nhalf-waking—a rapidity of development which I am persuaded occurs much\r\nmore frequently among the French than with the English or Germans.\r\nEnglish patients, especially, for the most part require a long course\r\nof education, many sittings, to have the same powers drawn out. And\r\nthese are by far the most interesting cases. I will describe, from Mr.\r\nWilliamson’s account, the course he has usually followed in developing\r\nhis patient’s powers, and the order in which they have manifested\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, perhaps, nothing can be elicited. But after some\r\nminutes, the stupor seems, as it were, less embarrassing to the\r\npatient, who appears less heavily slumbrous, and breathes lighter\r\nagain: or it may be the reverse, particularly if the patient is\r\nepileptic; after a little, the breathing may be deeper, the state one\r\nof less composure. Pointing with the hands to the pit of the stomach,\r\nlaying the hands upon the shoulders, and slowly moving them along\r\nthe arms down to the hands, the whole with the utmost quietude and\r\ncomposure on the part of the operator, will dispel this oppression.\r\n\r\nAnd the interest of the first sitting is confined to the process of\r\nawakening the patient, which is one of the most marvellous phenomena\r\nof the whole. The operator lays his two thumbs on the space between\r\nthe eyebrows, and as it were vigorously smooths or irons the eyebrows,\r\nrubbing them from within outwards seven or eight times. Upon this, the\r\npatient probably raises his head and his eyebrows, and draws a deeper\r\nbreath, as if he would yawn; he is half awake, and blowing upon the\r\neyelids, or the repetition of the previous operation, or dusting the\r\nforehead by smart transverse wavings of the hand, or blowing upon it,\r\ncauses the patient’s countenance to become animated; the eyelids open,\r\nhe looks about him, recognises you, and begins to speak. If any feeling\r\nof heaviness remains, any weight or pain of the forehead, another\r\nrepetition of the same manipulations sets all right. And yet this\r\npatient would not have been awakened if a gun had been fired at his\r\near, or his arm had been cut off.\r\n\r\nAt the next sitting, or the next to that, the living statue begins to\r\nwake in its tranced life. The operator holds one hand over the opposite\r\nhand of his patient, and makes as if he would draw the patient’s\r\nhand upwards, raising his own with short successive jerks, yet not\r\ntoo abrupt. Then the patient’s hand begins to follow his; and, often\r\nhaving ascended some inches, stops in the air catochally. This fixed\r\nstate is always relieved by transverse brushings with the hand, or by\r\nbreathing in addition, on the rigid limb. And it is most curious to see\r\nthe whole bodily frame, over which spasmodic rigidness may have crept,\r\nthus thawed joint by joint. Then the first effect shown commonly is\r\nthis motion, the patient’s hand following the operator’s. At the same\r\nsitting he begins to hear, and there is intelligence in his countenance\r\nwhen the operator pronounces his name: perhaps his lips move, and he\r\nbegins to answer pertinently, as in ordinary sleep-walking. But he\r\nhears the operator alone best, and him even in a whisper. _Your_ voice,\r\nif you shout, he does not hear: unless you take the operator’s hand,\r\nand then he hears _you_ too. In general, however, now the proximity of\r\nothers seems in some way to be sensible to him; and he appears uneasy\r\nwhen they crowd close upon him. It seems that the force of the relation\r\nbetween the operator and his patient naturally goes on increasing, as\r\nthe powers of the sleep-walker are developed; but that this is not\r\nnecessarily the case, and depends upon its being encouraged by much\r\ncommerce between them, and the exclusion of others from joining in this\r\ntrance-communion.\r\n\r\nAnd now the patient—beginning to wake in trance, hearing and answering\r\nthe questions of the operator, moving each limb, or rising even, as the\r\noperator’s hand is raised to draw him into obedient following—enters\r\ninto a new relation with his mesmeriser. He _adopts sympathetically\r\nevery voluntary movement of the other_. When the latter rises from\r\nhis chair, _he_ rises; when he sits down, _he_ sits down: if he bows,\r\n_he_ bows; if he makes a grimace, _he_ makes the same. Yet his eyes are\r\nclosed. He certainly does not see. His mind has interpenetrated to a\r\nsmall extent the nervous system of the operator; and is in relation\r\nwith his voluntary nerves and the anterior half of his cranio-spinal\r\nchord. (These are the organs by which the impulse to voluntary motion\r\nis conveyed and originated.) Further into the other’s being he has\r\nnot yet got. So he does not _what the other thinks of, or wishes him\r\nto do_: but only what the other either does, or goes through the\r\nmental part of doing. So Victor sang the air which M. de Puységur only\r\nmentally hummed.\r\n\r\nThe next strange phenomenon marks that the mind of the entranced\r\npatient has interpenetrated the nervous system of the other _a step\r\nfarther_, and is in relation besides with the posterior half of the\r\ncranio-spinal chord and its nerves. For now the entranced person, who\r\nhas no feeling, or taste, or smell of his own, _feels, tastes, and\r\nsmells every thing that is made to tell on the senses of the operator_.\r\nIf mustard or sugar be put in his own mouth, he seems not to know that\r\nthey are there; if mustard is placed on the tongue of the operator, the\r\nentranced person expresses great disgust, and tries as if to spit it\r\nout. The same with bodily pain. If you pluck a hair from the operator’s\r\nhead, the other complains of the pain you give _him_.\r\n\r\nTo state in the closest way what has happened: The phenomena of\r\nsympathetic motion and sympathetic sensation thus displayed are\r\nexactly such as might be expected to follow, if the mind or conscious\r\nprinciple of the entranced person were brought into relation with\r\nthe cranio-spinal chord of the operator and its nerves, and with no\r\nfarther portion of his nervous system. Later, it will be seen, the\r\ninterpenetration can extend farther.\r\n\r\nBut, before this happens, a new phenomenon manifests itself, not of a\r\nsympathetic character. The operator contrives to wake the entranced\r\nperson to the knowledge that he possesses new faculties. _He develops\r\nin him new organs of sensation_, or rather helps to hasten his\r\nrecognition of their possession.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that several who can be entranced cannot\r\nbe brought as far as the present step. Others make a tantalizing\r\nhalf-advance towards reaching it _thus_, and then stop. They are\r\nasked,—“Do you see any thing?” After some days, at length they answer\r\n“Yes.” “What?” “A light.” “Where is the light?” Then they intimate its\r\nplace to be either before them, or to one side, or above or behind\r\nthem. And they describe the colour of the light, which is commonly\r\nyellowish. And each day it is pointed to in the same direction, and is\r\nseen equally whether the room be light or dark. Their eyes in the mean\r\ntime are closed. And here with many the phenomenon stops. Others in\r\nthis light now begin to discern objects held in the direction in which\r\nthey see it. The range of this new visual organ, and the conditions\r\nunder which it acts, are different in different instances. Sometimes\r\nthe object must be close, sometimes it is best seen at a short\r\ndistance; but seen it is. The following experiment, which is decisive,\r\nwas made at my suggestion: A gentleman standing behind the entranced\r\nperson held behind him a pack of cards, from which he drew several in\r\nsuccession, and, without seeing them himself, presented them to the new\r\nvisual organ of the patient. In each case she named the card right.\r\nThe degree of light suited to this new mode of vision is variable:\r\nsometimes bright daylight is best; sometimes they prefer a moderate\r\nlight. Some distinguish figure and colour when the room is so dark that\r\nthe bystanders can distinguish neither.\r\n\r\nThese observations, which are, however, only in conformity with similar\r\nevidence from many other quarters, I give on the authority of Mr. J. W.\r\nWilliamson of Wickham, the gentleman to whom I have before alluded.\r\nThe following accidental features, attending the manifestation of\r\ntransposed senses, were further observed by Mr. Williamson:—\r\n\r\nIn most of the persons in whom Mr. Williamson has brought out\r\ntransposed vision, the faculty has been located in a small surface of\r\nthe scalp behind the left ear; and to see objects well, the patient\r\nhas held them at the distance of five or six inches from and opposite\r\nto this spot. One young woman, who had been temporarily set aside\r\nunder affliction for the loss of a relative, on the experiments being\r\nresumed, saw from all parts of the head, but confusedly, a broken and\r\nincomplete picture. On a subsequent day, she saw with the right side of\r\nher head. Afterwards the visual sense returned to its first place.\r\n\r\nIn one young person, the new sentient organ was on the top of her head,\r\nand to see objects she required them to be brought into contact with\r\nit. Once that she had a rheumatic cold and tenderness of the scalp, she\r\nsaid, when entranced, putting her hand to the crown of her head, that\r\nthe cold had made her eyes sore.\r\n\r\nOne person saw objects best when placed behind her at the distance of\r\nseven or eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe governess in a neighbouring family was mesmerised for\r\ntic-doloureux. In seven sittings she was cured. At the second sitting,\r\nin her trance she exhibited displaced sensation. She could read with\r\nher finger-ends; her way was to hold the book open against her chest,\r\nthe back of the book towards her, with one hand; then she passed a\r\nfinger of the other hand slowly over each word, to read it.\r\n\r\nThe part-physical character of these phenomena is shown by an\r\nobservation of Dr. Petetin’s on the first of his cataleptic patients.\r\nAt the time that the patient heard with the pit of her stomach, he\r\nfound that if with the fingers of one, say the left hand, he touched\r\nthe pit of her stomach, and whispered to the fingers of his right hand,\r\nthe patient heard him; but if the left hand was removed to the smallest\r\npossible distance from the patient, the contact being interrupted, she\r\nno longer heard him. Then he made a chain of seven persons, holding\r\neach other’s hands. The nearest to the patient was her sister, who\r\ntouched the pit of her stomach; at the other end was Dr. Petetin, who\r\nwhispered to his fingers, and was heard. A cane was then introduced\r\nas part of the circuit—the patient still heard; but if a stick of\r\nsealing-wax, or a glass rod, was substituted for it, or if one of the\r\nparty wore silk gloves, the patient could no longer hear Dr. Petetin.\r\nWithout close observation, what is physical in the phenomena which\r\nhave thus engaged us is liable to be overlooked; and the bystander\r\nmay class them as examples of lucidity, which they are not. Organic\r\nco-operation may be traced in them all. Thus, among Mr. Williamson’s\r\nearlier experiments, he tried, sitting before the entranced person,\r\n(who had shown no lucidity,) by imaging strongly to himself a white\r\nhorse, to force the image into her mind. When, being awakened, she had\r\nleft the room, on her way she said to her fellow-servant, “What was it\r\nmaster said to me about a white horse? I am sure he said something.”\r\nMr. Williamson, on learning the maid’s remark, supposed his mental\r\noperation had been successful. But the same experiment, when repeated,\r\nmostly failed. At last he found out why: It only succeeded when, in\r\nhis mental urgency, he half made in his own throat the motions of\r\nthe sounds that expressed the mental image. Then, and then only, the\r\npatient caught it. For her mind could not read his thoughts, but as\r\nyet had penetrated the inferior part of the nervous system only, the\r\ncranio-spinal cord; and, being there, had adopted sympathetically the\r\nvoluntary impulses that were there performed; so she half-moved the\r\nmuscles of her own vocal organs to express the idea, and from that—its\r\nimperfect expression—received it into her thoughts. No doubt the\r\nphenomenon of Victor’s singing the words to M. de Puységur’s mentally\r\nhummed air was the same with the above, and not one of mesmeric\r\nlucidity, the subject which we are now approaching.\r\n\r\nBut I pause;—and go no further.\r\n\r\nFor my object in these Letters, generally, has been to establish\r\nprinciples. And the phenomena of lucidity developed in artificial\r\ntrance have been only the same as, and have not been as yet made more\r\nof than, the lucidity of catalepsy. No further principle has yet\r\nemerged from their study; and my special object in this Letter has been\r\nto persuade the opponents of mesmerism to do it justice; and I think I\r\nam most likely to attain my end by not attempting to prove too much.\r\n\r\nSo that nothing remains for me to do, but to observe the form in which\r\nthese Letters were originally shaped, in recollection of the pleasant\r\nhours which the residence of your family at Boppard, during the winter\r\nof 1844-5, caused me, and to say finally,\r\n\r\n  DEAR ARCHY, Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\n SUPPLEMENTAL.—Abnormal neuro-psychical relation—-Cautions necessary\r\n in receiving trance communications—Trance-visiting—Mesmerising at\r\n a distance, and by the will—Mesmeric diagnosis and treatment of\r\n disease—Prevision—Ultra-vital vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal alterations made in “the Letters” for the present\r\nedition comprise an expansion of my account of “trances of spontaneous\r\noccurrence,” and the introduction of greater precision into our\r\nelementary conceptions of the relations of the mind and nervous system.\r\n\r\nLetters V., VI., VII., and VIII., establish that the most startling\r\nphenomena in popular superstitions, and the most wonderful performances\r\nby mesmerised persons, are but repetitions of events, the occurrence\r\nof which, as symptoms of, or as constituting, certain rare forms of\r\nnervous attacks, have been independently authenticated and put on\r\nrecord by physicians of credit. Letters II. and IX. exemplify the mode\r\nin which superstition has dressed up trance-phenomena; as letters\r\nIII. and IV. display the contributions she has levied on sensorial\r\nillusions, the Od force, and normal exoneural psychical phenomena.\r\nLetter X. describes the method of inducing trances artificially,\r\nwhereby they may be reproduced at pleasure, either in the interests of\r\nphilosophical inquiry, or for important practical purposes.\r\n\r\nI dedicate the present Letter to the reconsideration of the most\r\nknotty points already handled, and to the investigation of a few other\r\nquestions, the solution of which is not less difficult.\r\n\r\nI. _Hypothesis of an Abnormal Psychico-neural Relation as the essence\r\nof trance._—I admit that it is a very clumsy expedient to assume that\r\nthe mind can, as it were, get loose in the living body, and, while\r\nremaining there in a partially new alliance, exercise some of its\r\nfaculties in unaccustomed organs—which organs lose, for the same time,\r\ntheir normal participation in consciousness; and farther, that the mind\r\ncan, partially indeed, but so completely disengage itself from the\r\nliving body, that its powers of apprehension may range with what we\r\nare accustomed to consider the properties of free spirit, unlimitedly\r\nas to space and time. I adopt the hypothesis upon compulsion—that\r\nis to say, because I see no other way of accounting for the most\r\nremarkable trance-phenomena. In due time, it is to be expected that\r\na simple inductive expression of the facts will take the place of my\r\nhypothetical explanation. But not the less may the latter, crude as\r\nit is, prove of temporary use, by bringing together in a connected\r\nview many new and diversified phenomena, and planting the subject in a\r\nposition favourable for scientific scrutiny.\r\n\r\nLet me arrange, in their most persuasive order, the facts which seem to\r\njustify the hypothesis above enunciated.\r\n\r\n1. In many cases of waking-trance, the patient does not see with his\r\neyes, hear with his ears, nor taste with his tongue, and the sense of\r\ntouch appears to have deserted the skin. At the same time, the patient\r\nsees, hears, and tastes things applied to the pit of the stomach, or\r\nsees and hears with the back of the head, or tips of the fingers.\r\n\r\n2. In the first imperfect trance-waking from initiatory trance, the\r\npatient’s apprehension of sensuous impressions often appears to have\r\nentirely deserted his own body, and to be in relation with the sentient\r\napparatus in his mesmeriser’s frame—for, if you pull his hair, or put\r\nmustard in his mouth, he does not feel either; but he is actually alive\r\nto the sensations which these impressions excite, if the hair of the\r\nmesmeriser is pulled, or mustard placed on the mesmeriser’s tongue.\r\nThe sensations excited thus in the mesmeriser, and these alone, the\r\nentranced person realizes as his own sensations.\r\n\r\n3. About the same time, the entranced person displays no will of\r\nhis own, but his voluntary muscles execute the gestures which his\r\nmesmeriser is making, even when standing behind his back. His will\r\ntakes its guidance from sympathy with the exerted will of the other.\r\n\r\n4. Presently, if his trance-faculties continue to be developed, the\r\nentranced person enters into communication with the entire mind of\r\nhis mesmeriser. His apprehension seems to penetrate the brain of the\r\nlatter, and is capable of reading all his thoughts.\r\n\r\n5. In the last three steps, the apprehension of the entranced person\r\nappears to have left his own being to the extent described, and to\r\nhave entered into relation with the mind or nervous system of another\r\nperson. Now, if the patient become still more lucid, his apprehension\r\nseems to range abroad through space, and to identify material objects,\r\nand penetrate the minds of other human beings, at indefinite distances.\r\n\r\n6. At length the entranced person displays the power of revealing\r\nfuture events—a power which, as far as it relates to things separate\r\nfrom his own bodily organization, or that of others, seems to me\r\nto show that his apprehension is in relation with higher spiritual\r\nnatures, or with the Fountain of Truth itself.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have given examples of those of the powers\r\nhere attributed to very lucid clairvoyantes, which I have not\r\npreviously instanced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. _Transposition of the Senses._—No doubt these phenomena, irregular\r\nas they seem at present, follow a definite law, which has to be\r\ndetermined by future observations and experiments. Mr. Williamson found\r\nsome of his clairvoyantes see with the back of the head, some with the\r\nside of the head—some best at seven inches, others at as many feet\r\noff. In the case which Mr. Bulteel reported to me, the lady read with\r\nher hand and fingers; even when he pressed a note against the back\r\nof her neck, she read it instantly: but in this case actual contact\r\nwas necessary. In the case of a governess, artificially brought to\r\nthe state of waking-trance by Mr. Williamson, the same faculty was\r\nobserved. With one hand she used to hold open the book to be read,\r\nresting it against her chest, the pages being turned away from her:\r\nthe contents of these she read fluently, touching the words with the\r\nforefinger of the other hand. In one very interesting case, which I\r\nwitnessed here in the autumn of 1849, the young lady, clairvoyant\r\nthrough mesmerism, sitting in the corner of a sofa, something reclined,\r\nwould have seen, had she peeped through a linear aperture between her\r\nseemingly closed eyelids, the lower half of things only. As it was,\r\nthe reverse was the fact; and when we asked her what she saw, she\r\ntold us the cornice and upper part of the room. Then, without saying\r\nany thing, I raised my cap upon my stick to within her declared range\r\nof trance-vision; she exclaimed, “Ah, Guilleaume Tell!” Her mother,\r\nwhom she heard speak, but had not hitherto seen, in this trance, she\r\nrecognised at once, when she stood up upon a chair. To read, in this\r\ntrance, appeared a very painful effort to her; but she was certainly\r\nable to make out some words when she pressed a written paper against\r\nher forehead. It was evident that she could now visually discern things\r\nby some new faculty of apprehension localized there. To enable her\r\nto see things at a few feet distance, they had equally to be placed\r\n_opposite_ to her forehead. In another case, in which the girl, when\r\nentranced, certainly saw with the knuckles of one hand, on smearing the\r\nback of that hand with ink, she could no longer see with it.\r\n\r\nThe above instances show how various are the features attending the\r\ntransposition of one sense alone in waking trance; and they suggest a\r\nmultitude of experiments. I remember, in 1838, on communicating facts\r\nof this kind to a clear-headed practical man, he raised this objection\r\nto their credibility: “If we can see without eyes, why has the Creator\r\ngiven us eyes!” The objection is specious enough, but it admits of an\r\nobvious answer. The state of trance is one of disease, transient and\r\ntemporary; it is during its persistence only that this new power of\r\napprehension is manifested. In our natural state, the mind is intended\r\nto operate and try experiences in subordination to matter, and through\r\ndefinite material organs, in which it is, in truth, imprisoned. Such\r\nis the law of our normal mortal being. Accordingly, when the trance is\r\nover, and the mind has returned to its normal relations with the body,\r\nall its trance-apprehensions are forgotten by it—they form no part of\r\nour moral life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII. _Sources of Error in the communications of entranced persons._—I\r\nput aside cases of deliberate deception; but when persons are really\r\nentranced, they are liable, in various ways, to be deceived themselves,\r\nand to deceive others, as to the value of their revealments. There\r\nis often, in waking trance, a great vivacity and disposition to be\r\ncommunicative from the first. Those, again, who have frequently been\r\nthrown into trance, and have become familiar with their new condition,\r\nare generally anxious to shine in it, and make a display. This\r\ndisposition is further heightened when the entranced person expects to\r\nbe rewarded for his performance.\r\n\r\n1. When indulging their lively fancy, they are liable to have a sort\r\nof waking dream, during which they describe imaginary scenes with the\r\nprecision and minuteness of reality, and represent them as actual,\r\npassing at some place they name.\r\n\r\n2. They are liable to recall past impressions, and to deliver bits of\r\nold conclusions for intuitions.\r\n\r\n3. They are liable to adopt the thoughts of others who may be near\r\nthem, especially those of their mesmeriser, and to deliver them as\r\ntrance-revelations.\r\n\r\n4. In one instance which came to my knowledge, a young lady, previously\r\nunacquainted with mathematics or astronomy, would, when entranced, and\r\nsitting with her mother and sister, write fluently off pages of an\r\nastronomical treatise, calculations, diagrams, and all. She averred and\r\nbelieved in her entranced state—for, when awake, it was all a mystery\r\nto her—that this performance was the product of an intuition. Her\r\nmanuscript was afterwards found to run word for word with an article\r\nin the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. That book, however, stood in the\r\nlibrary, in a remote part of the house. She certainly had it not with\r\nher when she used to scribble its contents; nor did she remember ever\r\nhaving looked into it, awake or asleep. She said—when entranced, and\r\nthis had been found out—that she believed she read the book as it stood\r\nin the library.\r\n\r\n5. With some imperfectly lucid patients, the exercise of their new\r\nfaculties appears to be fatiguing, and to call for great exertion. So\r\nthey are occasionally with difficulty led to answer at all; and then\r\nwhen inconsiderately pressed, they are tempted to say any thing, just\r\nto be left tranquil.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say how the preceding sources of error are to be\r\neffectually guarded against. Possibly, by rigid training from the\r\nfirst, the patient might be brought to distinguish false promptings\r\nfrom genuine intuitions. But even the latter vary in lucidity and\r\ncertainty. This admission was made to a friend of mine by M. Alexis,\r\nthe celebrated Parisian clairvoyante. The reader cannot fail to be\r\ninterested by the following account, given by M. Alexis when entranced,\r\nof his own powers, and their mode of operation:—\r\n\r\n“Pour voir des objets éloignés,” observed M. Alexis, “mon âme ne se\r\ndégage pas de mon corps. C’est ma volonté qui dérige mon âme, mon\r\nesprit, sans sortir de cette chambre où je suis. Si mon âme sortit, je\r\nserais mort; c’est ma volonté. Ma volonté suffit pour anéantir pour\r\nquelque tems la matière. Ainsi quand cette volonté est en jeu, la boite\r\nmatérielle de mon individu n’est plus. Les murs, l’espace, et même le\r\ntems, n’existent plus. Mais ce n’est qu’un rêve plus ou moins lucide.\r\nQuelquefois ma vue est meilleure qu’à d’autres. Ma vue n’est jamais la\r\nmême. Une fois je suis disposé pour voir une sorte de choses, et une\r\nautre fois une autre sorte. En regardant votre chambre dans un quartier\r\néloigné d’ici, je ne vois pas les rues ni les maisons intermédiaires.\r\nLa seule chose (alors) qui est dans la pensée est la personne qui me\r\nparle. Je vois les objets d’une manière plus incomplète que par mes\r\nsens, moins sure. Il serait impossible de fair comprendre comment je\r\nvois. Plus il y a de l’attraction—plus j’éprouve de l’attraction aux\r\nobjets que je veux voir, ou qui me touche—plus il y a de lumière; plus\r\nj’éprouve de répulsion, plus il y a de ténèbres.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIV. _Of the Different Qualities of Od in different individuals._—Von\r\nReichenbach observed the Od light to have different colours under\r\ndifferent circumstances, and that, while Od-negative produces the\r\nsensation of a draft of cool air, Od positive produces a sense as of\r\na draft of warm air. An easy way to verify the last phenomenon is to\r\nbeg some one to hold the forefinger of the right hand pointed to your\r\nleft palm, at a quarter of an inch distance, and afterwards his left\r\nforefinger to your right palm, when the two sensations, and their\r\ndifference, are appreciable by the majority of persons.\r\n\r\nPersons entranced by mesmeric procedures are often keenly alive to the\r\nabove impressions. They see light emanating from the finger-tips of\r\nthe mesmeriser, and feel an agreeable afflatus from his manipulations.\r\nOthers who approach them affect them in different ways—some not\r\ndisagreeably, while others excite a chilly, shivering feeling, and the\r\npatient begs they will keep off from him.\r\n\r\nA gentleman narrated to me the following case. He had been for months\r\nin anxious attendance upon a brother who was in very delicate health,\r\nand exquisitely sensitive to mesmerism. My friend used himself to\r\nmesmerise his brother; but he found it necessary, in order to soothe\r\nand not excite him by the passes, to cover the patient with a folded\r\nblanket, so as to dull the agency of his Od-emanation. There was but\r\nanother person, of several who had been tried, whose hand the brother\r\ncould bear at all; this was a maid-servant, who herself was highly\r\nsusceptible, and became entranced. She said that she perceived, when\r\nentranced, the suitableness of her influence, and that of the brother,\r\nto the patient; and she used the singular expression, that they were\r\nnearly of a colour. She said that the patient’s Od-emanation was of\r\na pink colour, and that the brother’s was a brick colour—a flatter,\r\ndeeper, red; and she endeavoured to find some one else with the same\r\ncoloured Od to suit her master.\r\n\r\nIn some experiments made at Dr. Leighton’s house in Gower Street,\r\nI remember it was distinctly proved that each of the experimenters\r\nproduced different effects on the same person. The patient was one of\r\nthe Okeys, of mesmeric celebrity. The party consisted of Dr. Elliotson,\r\nMr. Wheatstone, Dr. Grant, Mr. Kiernan, and some others. Mr. Wheatstone\r\ntabulated the results. Each of us mesmerised a sovereign; and it was\r\nfound that on each trial the trance-coma, which contact with the thus\r\nmesmerised gold induced, had a characteristic duration for each of us.\r\nIs it possible that each living person has his distinguishable measure\r\nof Od, either in intensity or quality?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nV. _The Od-Force is the usual channel of establishing mesmeric\r\nrelation._—I take it for granted that the Od-force—the existence and\r\nsome of the properties of which have been inductively ascertained by\r\nVon Reichenbach—is the same agent with that which Mesmer assumed to\r\nbe the instrument in his operations. Then, in support of the above\r\nproposition, I cite two instances. Mr. Williamson, at my request,\r\nmesmerised and entranced the Rev. Mr. Fox at Weilbach, in the autumn of\r\n1847. It was the second sitting, and Mr. Fox was beginning to pass from\r\nthe initiatory stage of trance into trance half-waking. Mr. Williamson\r\naddressed him, and he returned an answer. Other parties in the room,\r\nincluding myself, then addressed Mr. Fox, and he seemed not to hear one\r\nof us. Then Mr. Williamson gave me his hand, and I again spoke to Mr.\r\nFox; he then heard me, and spoke in answer. When, having left go Mr.\r\nWilliamson’s hand, I spoke again to Mr. Fox, he heard me not. On my\r\nrenewing contact with Mr. Williamson, Mr. Fox heard me again. He heard\r\nme as long as I was brought into relation with him, and that relation\r\nwas clearly due to the establishment of an Od-current between myself\r\nand Mr. Williamson, with whom Mr. Fox was already in trance-relation.\r\nEvery one who has seen something of Mesmerism will recognise in the\r\nabove story one of its commonest phenomena.\r\n\r\nBut a more conclusive instance still has been already mentioned in\r\nLetter X. M. Petetin made a chain of seven persons holding hands, the\r\nseventh holding the hand of a cataleptic patient, who at that time\r\nheard by her fingers only. When Dr. Petetin spoke to the fingers of the\r\nfirst, _i. e._ the most remote, person of the chain, the cataleptic\r\nperson heard him as well as if he had spoken to her own fingers. Even\r\nwhen a stick was made to form part of the circuit, the cataleptic still\r\nheard Dr. Petetin’s whisper, uttered at the other end of the chain.\r\n_Not so, however, if one of the parties forming the chain wore silk\r\ngloves._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVI. _Trance-Identification of persons at a distance by means of\r\nmaterial objects._—A very lucid clairvoyante, her eyes being bandaged,\r\nrecognises not the less, without preparation or effort, every\r\nacquaintance present in the room; describes their dress, the contents\r\nof their purses, or of letters in their pockets, and reads their\r\ninnermost thoughts. An ordinary clairvoyante usually requires the\r\ncontact of the party’s hand with whom it is proposed to bring her into\r\ntrance-relation; then only does she first know any thing about her\r\nnew patient. It cannot be doubted that, in the latter case, it is the\r\nestablishment of an Od-current between the two that enables the mind of\r\nthe clairvoyante to penetrate the interior being of the visiter,—just\r\nas, in the humblest effects of common mesmerism, a relation is sensibly\r\nestablished between the party entranced and her mesmeriser, through\r\nthe Od-current which he had previously directed upon her, in order to\r\nproduce the trance. So far, all is theoretically clear enough.\r\n\r\nBut how is the establishment of the same relation between the\r\nclairvoyante and a party wholly unknown to her, and residing many\r\nmiles off, to be explained, when the only visible medium of physical\r\nconnexion employed has been a lock of hair or a letter written by\r\nthe distant party, and placed in the hands of the clairvoyante? Let\r\nme begin by giving the explanation, and afterwards exemplify the\r\nphenomenon out of my own experience.\r\n\r\nI conceive that the lock of hair, or the letter on which his hand has\r\nrested, is charged with the Od-fluid emanating from the distant person;\r\nand that the clairvoyante measures exactly the force and quality of\r\nthis dose of Od, and, as it were, individualizes it. Then, using this\r\nclue, _distance being annihilated to the entranced mind_, it seeks for,\r\nor is drawn towards, whatever there is more of this same individual\r\nOd quality any where in space. When that is found, the party sought\r\nis identified, and brought into relation with the clairvoyante, who\r\nproceeds forthwith to tell all about him.\r\n\r\nNow for an exemplification of this marvellous phenomenon. Being at\r\nBoppard, a letter of mine addressed to a friend in Paris was by him put\r\ninto the hands of M. Alexis, who was asked to describe me. M. Alexis\r\ntold at once my age and stature, my disposition, and my illness; how\r\nthat I am entirely crippled, and at that time of the day, half-past\r\neleven, A.M. was in bed. All this, to be sure, M. Alexis might have\r\nread in my friend’s mind, without going farther. But, he added, this\r\ngentleman lives on the sea-coast. My friend denied the assertion;\r\nbut M. Alexis continued very positive that he was right. Now, most\r\noddly, the Rhine, on the banks of which I resided then, is at Boppard\r\nthe boundary of Prussia; and I never cross it, or visit Nassau, but\r\nI am in the habit of sitting on the bank, listening to the breaking\r\nof the surge, which the passing steamers create, and which exactly\r\nresembles the murmur of the sea. This very mistake of M. Alexis helped\r\nto convince me that this performance of his was genuine. However,\r\nbeing stoutly contradicted by my friend, M. Alexis reconsidered the\r\nmatter, and said, “No; he does not live on the sea-coast, but on the\r\nRhine, twenty leagues from Frankfort.” This answer was exact. But\r\nthere was another point which M. Alexis hit with curious felicity. I\r\nshould observe that this friend was one of a few months’ date, who had\r\nno means of comparing what I am with what I was formerly. But it had\r\nhappened that I had written, not to him, but to a friend resident\r\nin England, _about the same time_, that, ill as I was, my mind was\r\nsingularly clear and active, and that I regarded the fact as a sign\r\nmy end was at hand; that the mental brightness probably resembled\r\nthe flaring-up of a rushlight before it goes out. Well, M. Alexis,\r\nadverting to my condition, observed that I was extremely weak, and had\r\nsuffered much from irritation of the nerves;—facts true enough, but\r\nwhich certainly would not have led him to infer the existence of that\r\nclearness of mind which I had myself remarked. Nevertheless, strangely\r\nadded M. Alexis, “Le morale n’en est pas atteint; au contraire,\r\nl’esprit est plus dégagé et plus vif qu’auparavant.” I can therefore\r\nentertain no doubt, that at four hundred miles’ distance, merely by\r\nhandling a recent letter from me, M. Alexis had identified me as\r\nits writer, through the Od-fluid the letter conveyed; and had truly\r\npenetrated my physical and mental being so completely, that most that\r\nwas important in my story lay distinctly revealed before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVII. _Mental Travelling by clairvoyantes._—Let me begin with an\r\ninstance. The following extract from the _Zoist_ contains a very\r\ninteresting narrative by Lord Ducie, which is exactly to the point:\r\n\r\n“In the highest departments or phenomena of mesmerism, he for a long\r\ntime was a disbeliever, and could not bring himself to believe in the\r\npower of reading with the eyes bandaged, or of mental travelling; at\r\nlength, however, he was convinced of the truth of those powers, and\r\nthat, too, in so curious and unexpected a way, that there could have\r\nbeen no possibility of deception. It happened that he had to call\r\nupon a surgeon on business, and when he was there the surgeon said to\r\nhim, ‘You have never seen my little clairvoyante.’ He replied that\r\nhe never had, and should like to see her very much. He was invited to\r\ncall the next day, but upon his replying that he should be obliged to\r\nleave town that evening, he said, ‘Well, you can come in at once. I am\r\nobliged to go out; but I will ring the bell for her, and put her to\r\nsleep, and you can ask her any questions you please.’ He (Lord Ducie)\r\naccordingly went in. He had never been in the house in his life before,\r\nand the girl could have known nothing of him. The bell was rung; the\r\nclairvoyante appeared: the surgeon, without a word passing, put her to\r\nsleep, and then he put on his hat and left the room. He (Lord Ducie)\r\nhad before seen something of mesmerism, and he sat by her, took her\r\nhand, and asked her if she felt able to travel. She replied, ‘Yes;’\r\nand he asked her if she had ever been in Gloucestershire, to which she\r\nanswered that she had not, but should very much like to go there, as\r\nshe had not been in the country for six years: she was a girl of about\r\nseventeen years old. He told her that she should go with him, for he\r\nwanted her to see his farm. They travelled (mentally) by the railroad\r\nvery comfortably together, and then (in his imagination) got into a fly\r\nand proceeded to his house. He asked her what she saw; and she replied,\r\n‘I see an iron gate and a curious old house.’ He asked her, ‘How do\r\nyou get to it?’ she replied, ‘By this gravel-walk;’ which was quite\r\ncorrect. He asked her how they went into it; and she replied, ‛I see a\r\nporch—a curious old porch.‘ It was probably known to many, that his\r\nhouse, which was a curious old Elizabethan building, was entered by a\r\nporch, as she had described. He asked her what she saw on the porch,\r\nand she replied, truly, that it was covered with flowers. He then said,\r\n‛Now, we will turn in at our right hand; what do you see in that room?’\r\nShe answered with great accuracy, ‘I see a book case, and a picture\r\non each side of it.’ He told her to turn her back to the book case,\r\nand say what she saw on the other side; and she said, ‘I see something\r\nshining, like that which soldiers wear.’ She also described some old\r\nmuskets and warlike implements which were hanging in the hall; and upon\r\nhis asking her how they were fastened up, (meaning by what means they\r\nwere secured,) she mistook his question, but replied, ‘The muskets\r\nare fastened up in threes,’ which was the case. He then asked of what\r\nsubstance the floors were built; and she said, ‘Of black and white\r\nsquares,’ which was correct. He then took her to another apartment, and\r\nshe very minutely described the ascent to it as being by four steps, He\r\n(Lord Ducie) told her to enter by the right door, and say what she saw\r\nthere; she said, ‘There is a painting on each side of the fire-place.’\r\nUpon his asking her if she saw any thing particular in the fire-place,\r\nshe replied, ‘Yes; it is carved up to the ceiling,’ which was quite\r\ncorrect, for it was a curious old Elizabethan fire-place. There was at\r\nTotworth-court a singular old chestnut-tree; and he told her that he\r\nwished her to see a favourite tree, and asked her to accompany him. He\r\ntried to deceive her by saying, ‘Let us walk close up to it;’ but she\r\nreplied, ‘We cannot, for there are railings round it.’ He said, ‘Yes,\r\nwooden railings;’ to which she answered, ‘No, they are of iron,’ which\r\nwas the case. He asked, ‘What tree is it?’ and she replied that she had\r\nbeen so little in the country that she could not tell; but upon his\r\nasking her to describe the leaf, she said, ‘It is a leaf as dark as the\r\ngeranium-leaf, large, long, and jagged at the edges.’ He (Lord Ducie)\r\napprehended that no one could describe more accurately than that the\r\nleaf of the Spanish chestnut. He then told her he would take her to see\r\nhis farm, and desired her to look over a gate into a field which he had\r\nin his mind, and tell him what she saw growing; she replied that the\r\nfield was all over green, and asked if it was potatoes, adding that she\r\ndid not know much about the country. It was not potatoes, but turnips.\r\nHe then said, ‘Now look over this gate to the right, and tell me what\r\nis growing there.’ She at once replied, ‘There is nothing growing\r\nthere; it is a field of wheat, but it has been cut and carried.’ This\r\nwas correct; but knowing that, in a part of the field, grain had been\r\nsown at a different period, he asked her if she was sure that the whole\r\nof it had been cut. She replied, that she could not see the end of the\r\nfield, as the land rose in the middle, which in truth it did. He then\r\nsaid to her, ‘Now we are on the brow, can you tell me if it is cut?’\r\nShe answered, ‘No, it is still growing here.’ He then said to her,\r\n‛Now, let us come to this gate—tell me where it leads to.‘ She replied,\r\n‛Into a lane.’ She then went on and described every thing on his farm\r\nwith the same surprising accuracy; and upon his subsequently inquiring,\r\nhe found that she was only in error in one trifling matter, for which\r\nerror any one who had ever travelled (mentally) with a clairvoyante\r\ncould easily account, without conceiving any breach of the truth.”\r\n\r\nIf the preceding example stood alone, or if, in parallel cases, no\r\nfurther phenomena manifested themselves, nothing more would be required\r\nto explain the facts than to suppose that the mental fellow-traveller\r\nreads all your thoughts, and adopts your own imagery and impressions.\r\nBut there are not wanting cases in which the fellow-traveller has seen\r\nwhat was not in his companion’s mind, and was at variance with his\r\nbelief; while subsequent inquiry has proved that the clairvoyante’s\r\nunexpected story was true. These more complicated cases prove that the\r\nclairvoyante _actually_ pays a mental visit to the scene. But she can\r\ndo more; she can pass on to other and remoter scenes and places, of\r\nwhich her fellow-traveller has no cognizance.\r\n\r\nFor example, a young person whom Mr. Williamson mesmerised became\r\nclairvoyant. In this state she paid me a mental visit at Boppard;\r\nand Mr. Williamson, who had been a resident there, was satisfied\r\nthat she realized the scene. Afterwards I removed to Weilbach, where\r\nMr. Williamson had never been. Then he proposed to the clairvoyante\r\nto visit me again. She reached, accordingly, in mental travelling,\r\nmy former room in Boppard; and expressed surprise and annoyance at\r\nnot finding me there, and at observing others in its occupation. Mr.\r\nWilliamson proposed that she should set out, and try to find me.\r\nShe said, “You must help me.” Then Mr. Williamson said, “We must go\r\nup the river some way, till we come to a great town,” (Mainz.) The\r\nclairvoyante said she had got there. “Then,” said Mr. Williamson, “we\r\nmust now go up another river, (the Maine,) which joins our river at\r\nthis town, and try and find Dr. Mayo on its banks somewhere.” Then\r\nthe clairvoyante said, “Oh, there is a large house; let us go and\r\nsee it; no, there are two large houses—one white, the other red.”\r\nUpon this, Mr. Williamson proposed that she should go into one of the\r\ntwo houses, and look about; she quickly recognised my servant, went\r\nmentally into my room, found me, and described a particular or two,\r\nwhich were by no means likely to be guessed by her. When Mr. Williamson\r\nsubsequently came to visit me at Weilbach, he was forcibly struck with\r\nthe appearance of the two houses, which tallied with the account given\r\nbeforehand by the mental traveller. I have not the smallest doubt she\r\nmentally realized my new abode. Then, how did she do all this?\r\n\r\nThe first question is, how does the clairvoyante realize scenes which\r\nare familiar to her fellow-traveller? I cannot help inclining to the\r\nbelief that, in the _ordinary perception_ of a place or person, the\r\nmind acts exoneurally; and that our apprehension (as I have ventured\r\nto conjecture in Letter V.) comes thus always into a direct relation\r\nwith the place or person. There is a peculiar vividness in a first\r\nimpression, which every one must have observed; there is no renewing\r\nthat force of impression again. This fact helps my hypothesis. It will\r\nbe remembered again, that in Zschokke’s narrative of his seer-gift,\r\nhe never penetrated the minds of his visiters unless at their very\r\nfirst visit. It is the same, even to a certain extent, with mesmeric\r\ninspection of the mind. My friend, who consulted M. Alexis for me,\r\nconsulted him likewise for himself more than once. At the first visit,\r\nM. Alexis traced an aggravation of his illness, a year before, to\r\ndistress occasioned by the death of two younger brothers at a short\r\ninterval. On my friend’s subsequent visits, M. Alexis marked no\r\nknowledge at all of the latter occurrence. Slightly as these facts are\r\nconnected, they concurrently strengthen my notion of the occurrence\r\nof an exoneural act of the mind in common perception. I suspect, I\r\nrepeat, that, in visiting new places, the mind establishes a direct\r\nrelation with the scenes or persons. Then, in the simplest case of\r\nmental visiting, where the scene visited is familiar to the other\r\nparty, I presume that the clairvoyante’s mind, being in communion with\r\nthe mind of the other, realizes scenes which the latter has previously\r\nexoneurally realized. Arriving thus at the scene itself, the\r\nclairvoyante observes for herself, and sees what may be new in it, and\r\nunknown to her fellow-traveller; and in the same way may pursue, as in\r\nthe mental visit made to myself at Weilbach, suggested features of the\r\nlocality, and be thus helped to beat about in space for new objects,\r\nand at length to recognise among them, and mentally identify, persons\r\nwith whom she has already arrived at a mental mesmeric relation.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Mesmerising at a Distance. Mesmerising by the Will_.—I have\r\nnot heard of a case in which a person has been _for the first time_\r\nmesmerised with effect by one _out of the room_.\r\n\r\nGenerally the mesmeriser is very near to his patient at the first\r\nsitting, often actually holding his hand—at all events so near that the\r\nOd-emanation of his person might be expected to reach the patient. And\r\nthe patient is often sensible of new sensations, which he is disposed\r\nto attribute to the physical agency of the operator on him. In Mr.\r\nBraid’s cases, it seemed to me clear that the effects were mainly\r\nbrought about, as in common mesmerism, by his personal influence.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when a patient has by use become highly sensitive to Od,\r\nand disposed to fall into trance, I have myself, by making passes _in\r\nthe next room_, succeeded in producing the sleep. And I have seen, with\r\nopen doors, mesmeric effects produced by passes at the distance of\r\nninety feet.\r\n\r\nBut with persons rendered through use extremely susceptible of mesmeric\r\nimpression, an effect may be produced by the habitual mesmeriser of the\r\npatient at almost unlimited distances. The following instance is given\r\nby Dr. Foissac in his valuable work on mesmerism, entitled _Rapports\r\net Discussions sur le Magnétisme Animal_, (Paris, 1838.) Dr. Foissac\r\nspeaks, in the first person, of an experiment made by himself on a\r\npatient of the name of Paul Villagrand, whom he had been in the habit\r\nof mesmerising in the usual way at Paris, where both resided.\r\n\r\n“In the course of the June ensuing,” says Dr. Foissac, “Paul expressed\r\nthe wish to pass some days in his native place, Magnac-Laval, Haute\r\nVienne. I provided him with the means, and proposed to turn his journey\r\nto scientific account by attempting to entrance him at the distance\r\nof a hundred leagues. He was not to know my intention before the time\r\ncame; but on the 2d of July, at half-past five P.M., his father was\r\nto give him a note from me, which ran thus—‘I am magnetising you at\r\nthis moment; I will awake you when you have had a quarter of an hour’s\r\nsleep.’ M. Villagrand made the success of the experiment the more\r\ndecisive by not handing over my letter to his son, and so disregarding\r\nmy instructions. Nevertheless, at ten minutes before six, Paul being\r\nin the midst of his family, experienced a sensation of heat, and\r\nconsiderable uneasiness. His shirt was wet through with perspiration;\r\nhe wished to retire to his room; but they detained him. In a few\r\nminutes he was entranced. In this state he astonished the persons\r\npresent, by reading with his eyes shut several lines of a book taken at\r\nhazard from the library, and by telling the hour upon a watch they held\r\nto him. He awoke in a quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\nOne naturally doubts whether the physical influence of the Od force\r\ncan extend to this enormous distance; whether the agency ought not to\r\nbe regarded as purely psychical; whether, in short, the will of the\r\nspeaker may not have been the exclusive agent employed.\r\n\r\nI think that there is a disposition, among experimenters in mesmerism,\r\nto attribute too much to the agency of the will. There was with me\r\nin the autumn of 1849 a young lady, who was extremely susceptible of\r\nmesmerism. A gentleman who came with the family had been in the habit\r\nof entrancing her daily, and at last she was so sensitive that a wave\r\nof his hand would fix her motionless. His presence even in the room\r\naffected her; and if he then tried to mesmerise her sister, she herself\r\ninvariably became entranced. The operator was a person of remarkable\r\nmesmeric power. Then at my request, made unknown to her, he went to the\r\nend window of the room, and, looking out upon the Rhine, tried at the\r\nsame time with the most forcible mental efforts to will her into sleep.\r\nThe attempt failed entirely. Another day that he was in my room, about\r\nfifty feet from the room in which the young lady was sitting, he tried\r\nagain by the will to entrance her. But it was all in vain. Therefore,\r\nif the will ever acts independently of Od influence, I am disposed to\r\nthink that its action in producing trance must be infinitely feebler\r\nthan the direct use of Od.\r\n\r\nHowever, some are convinced of the positive agency of the will\r\nin mesmerising. The following statement by Mr. H. S. Thompson of\r\nFairfield, made in a letter to Dr. Elliotson, published in the _Zoist_,\r\nadmits the inferiority in force of the will to the material agency of\r\nOd, at the same time that it goes far to prove its efficiency.\r\n\r\n“I have succeeded,” says Mr. Thompson, “in arresting spasms, and\r\ntaking away every species of pain, and in producing intense heat and\r\nperspiration, by the will only; and in many instances without the\r\nknowledge of the patients, who have been all unconscious of the power\r\nI have been exerting, until after the results have occurred. At the\r\nsame time, I have generally found that the passes in combination with\r\nthe will, or attention, most readily produce the effects we desire; and\r\nthat manipulations are much less fatiguing to the operator than the\r\nexertion of the will.”\r\n\r\nOf an extremely sensitive patient, who was suffering with rheumatic\r\npains, Mr. H. S. Thompson observes, “A few passes put her to sleep,\r\nthough she was moaning as in great pain, and scarcely seemed to notice\r\nwhat I was doing. After sleeping for a few minutes, her face became\r\ncomposed, and she showed no symptoms of pain; but as I could not\r\nget her to speak in her sleep, I awakened her. She looked very much\r\nsurprised, and said that she felt very comfortable and free from pain.\r\nI told my friend that she was so sensitive that I thought that she\r\nmight be put to sleep by the will in a few minutes. The bed-curtains\r\nwere drawn, so that she could not see or know what was going on. I\r\nfixed my attention upon her, wishing her to go to sleep. When we\r\nlooked at her two minutes afterwards, she was fast asleep. It was\r\nagreed that the following day, though I should be thirty miles off,\r\nthe experiment should be tried again. A lady went at the time fixed\r\non. I purposely postponed the time half-an-hour, thinking that the\r\nwoman might have become acquainted with my intention, and go to sleep\r\nthrough the power of the imagination. The lady’s account was, that she\r\ncalled upon the woman at the time agreed on, and at first thought that\r\nthe experiment was going to fail, as she saw no symptoms of sleep; but\r\nthat in half-an-hour afterwards the patient went into a deep sleep,\r\nwhich lasted some time. After this she went to sleep every day for a\r\nfortnight at the same time, though I did not will her to sleep. She\r\nsays that she felt in a dreamy and happy state for some days after.”\r\n\r\nI might add many similar facts to the above interesting observations.\r\nThe mass of evidence existing on the subject establishes beyond all\r\ndoubt that patients have been thrown into trances by persons who have\r\npreviously mesmerised them in the common way, at distances which seem\r\nto preclude the idea of any physical agent having been the medium\r\nof communication between the two parties. The operation seems to\r\nhave been in those instances mental. Then how is such a result to be\r\nexplained?—or by what expression can it be brought to tally with the\r\nprinciples I am endeavouring to substantiate? I shape the answer thus:—\r\n\r\nThe first step is ordinary mesmerising; in other words, the operator\r\ndirects an Od-current upon the patient, the Od in whose system is\r\nthereby disturbed; and initiatory trance ensues as the consequence.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The mind of the patient thus entranced enters into relation\r\nwith, or is attracted towards, the mind or person of the mesmeriser.\r\nI remember witnessing a most decisive instance in which the operation\r\nof this attraction was singularly manifested. The place was Dr.\r\nElliotson’s waiting-room; the patient, a young man whom Mr. Simpson\r\nhad entranced. Mr. Simpson then moved about the room, standing still\r\nat several points in it in succession. The young man seemed attracted\r\ntowards Mr. Simpson, to whom he drew near each time he stopped; then\r\nhe pressed against Mr. Simpson, jostling him out of his place, which\r\nhe planted himself in—his countenance bearing an expression of huge\r\ndelight at what he had achieved. But in half a minute he began to look\r\nanxious and uneasy; and again—his eyes being shut all the while—he\r\nset off in search of Mr. Simpson, and repeated the same scene. There\r\nexists, it would appear, an attraction between the (mind of the?)\r\nentranced person and (that of?) his mesmeriser, or (that of?) any\r\nother person with whom the entranced person has secondarily come into\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nThen, thirdly, It may be presumed that, in phenomena which are purely\r\nmental, space and distance go for nothing. But if this supposition be\r\nadmitted, it would be as easy for a mesmeriser to entrance by a mental\r\neffort a sensitive and habituated patient at a hundred miles off as\r\nat the end of the same room. The phenomenon thus viewed is wholly\r\nexoneural. The one mind is supposed to be actually sensitive to the\r\ninfluence of the other. Each of the two minds, though in different\r\ndegrees, energizes, it may be imagined, beyond its bodily frame. And\r\nthe mind of the patient feels the force of the mesmeriser’s will acting\r\nupon it, and slips as it were at once, by the accustomed track, out of\r\nthe normal into the abnormal psychico-neural relation.\r\n\r\nStill I cannot get rid of a lurking notion that, in the phenomena\r\nlast considered, the Od-force contributes an element of physical or\r\nphysico-dynamic influence. For, putting for the moment aside the idea\r\nof mental action, what is to prevent two living bodies, that may be in\r\nOd-relation, or in exact Od-unison, from physically influencing one\r\nanother at indefinite distances?\r\n\r\nIX. _Trance-Diagnosis_.—From Boppard, where I was residing in the\r\nwinter of 1845-6, I sent to an American gentleman residing in Paris\r\na lock of hair, which Col. C—, an invalid then under my care, had\r\ncut from his own head, and wrapped in writing-paper from his own\r\nwriting-desk. Col. C—was unknown even by name to this American\r\ngentleman, who had no clue whatever whereby to identify the proprietor\r\nof the hair. And all that he had to do and did was to place the\r\npaper, enclosing the lock of hair, in the hands of a noted Parisian\r\nsomnambulist. She stated, in the opinion she gave on the case, that\r\nCol. C—had partial palsy of the hips and legs, and that for another\r\ncomplaint he was in the habit of using a surgical instrument. The\r\npatient laughed heartily at the idea of the distant somnambulist having\r\nso completely realized him.\r\n\r\nThe mesmeric discrimination of disease involves three degrees.\r\n\r\nFirst, the clairvoyante placed in relation with the patient, either\r\nby taking his hand, or by handling a lock of his hair, or any thing\r\nimpregnated with his Od, _feels all his feelings_, realizes his\r\nsensations, and describes what he sensibly labours under. Her account\r\nof the case thus obtained will be more or less happy, according to the\r\nextent of her previous knowledge respecting ordinary disease.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the clairvoyante, if in a higher state of lucidness, actually\r\nsees and inspects the interior bodily construction of the patient,\r\nwhose inward organs are, as it would seem, lit with Od-light, for her\r\nexamination. Or she sees them by their Od-light, being in mesmeric\r\nrelation with the internal frame of the patient.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the clairvoyante, if still more lucid, foresees what will\r\nbe the progress of the malady; what further organic changes are\r\nthreatened; what will be the patient’s fate.\r\n\r\nThe first two points require no further comment. I reserve my comments\r\nupon the last for another head.\r\n\r\nX. _Mesmeric Treatment_.—Let me first advert to the use of artificial\r\ntrance as an anæsthetic agent in the service of surgery. There is\r\nno doubt that, when a patient can thus be deprived of ordinary\r\nsensibility, the resource is preferable to the employment of\r\nchloroform. Not only is it absolutely free from risk, but its direct\r\neffect is to soothe and tranquillize; whereas chloroform is but a\r\npowerful narcotic, the effects of which are obtained through a brief\r\nstage of violent physical excitement. Then, at each dressing—at any\r\nmoment, in short, when advisable—mesmerism may be again resorted to,\r\nwhich chloroform cannot. The honour of having been the first to employ\r\nmesmerism systematically, as an anæsthetic agent, belongs to James\r\nEsdale, M. D., Presidency Surgeon at Calcutta. The reports of his\r\nsuccess, in a vast body of cases, many of the most serious description,\r\nare given in the _Zoist_.\r\n\r\nA second point is the employment of artificial trance as a universal\r\nsedative; as a means from which, in all cases purely nervous, the most\r\nadmirable results may be expected and are realized; and from which, in\r\ndisease in general, singular and beneficial effects have been obtained.\r\nThis success was confidently to be anticipated, the instant that the\r\nreal nature of mesmeric phenomena was appreciated.\r\n\r\nA third point is the employment of mesmeric passes, without the\r\nintention or power to produce trance,—simply as a local means of\r\ntranquillizing the nervous sensibility of a diseased part, and allaying\r\nthe morbid phenomena which depend upon local nervous irritation.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth point under this head which will be regarded as more\r\nquestionable, viz. the power attributed to clairvoyantes of prescribing\r\ntreatment for themselves and others. Nevertheless, in their own cases,\r\nwhere the prescriptions have been limited to baths, and bleeding, and\r\nmesmerism itself, the boldness and precision of their practice, and\r\nits success, have been such as to excite our wonder, and almost to\r\ncommand our confidence. It does not, however, seem that the treatment\r\nprescribed by clairvoyantes to others is equally certain; and when they\r\nrecommend drugs, it is clear that, adopting the fashion of the time and\r\ncountry in medicine, they are only prescribing by guess, like other\r\ndoctors. But they sometimes guess very cleverly.\r\n\r\nXI. _Phreno-Mesmerism_.—How great is my regret that I can no longer\r\ntake an active part in physiological inquiry! How great is my regret\r\nthat, in former years, when I worked at the physiology of the nervous\r\nsystem, I undervalued phrenology! Prejudiced against it by the writings\r\nof the late Dr. Gordon, by the authority of my early instructors, by\r\nthe puerile mode in which craniology was generally advocated, by the\r\nsuperficial quality of the cerebral anatomy of Gall, I confined my\r\nattention to what I considered sounder objects of investigation. But\r\nnow I have no doubt, not only that the metaphysical speculations of\r\nGall were in the main just, but, likewise, that a great part of his\r\ncraniological chart is accurately laid down. To connect phrenology\r\nwith severe anatomical research, to endeavour to determine the organic\r\nconditions which interfere with the application of the science to\r\npractical purposes, would be a task worthy the efforts of the best\r\nphysiological labourer. Then, if phrenology be true, and the organology\r\nin the main correct, what is more likely than that directing an Od\r\ncurrent upon the cerebral seat of a mental faculty should bring\r\nit into activity? I have myself witnessed the repetition of this\r\nnow common experiment, in a very unexceptionable instance; and the\r\nsuccess was perfect. The organs of veneration, of combativeness,\r\nof alimentiveness, were successively excited; and in each case a\r\nbrilliant piece of acting followed. I must confess, however, that I\r\ncould not divest myself of the impression that, whatever pains we\r\ntook to conceal our plans, the clairvoyant young lady really knew\r\nbeforehand what was expected of her, and performed accordingly. I speak\r\nin reference to the single instance which I have myself witnessed. I\r\ncannot, however, refuse to credit the testimony of good observers—such\r\nas Dr. Elliotson—to facts which seem to establish the genuineness of\r\nphreno-mesmerism. In its double relation to phrenology and mesmerism,\r\nthis inquiry well merits attention.\r\n\r\nXII. _Rapport. Mesmeric Relation. Psychical Attraction._—Without\r\npresuming to place absolute confidence in the preceding speculations,\r\nbut, on the contrary, apologizing for their hypothetical character,\r\non the plea that any theory is better than none, let me now\r\nrecapitulatorily put in array the facts and principles to which the\r\nterms at the head of this section refer:—\r\n\r\n1. I hold that the mind of a living person, in its most normal state,\r\nis always, to a certain extent, acting exoneurally, or beyond the limit\r\nof the bodily person; but, possibly, always in conjunction with some\r\nOd-operation.\r\n\r\n2. I suppose that there must be laws of neuro-psychical attraction, or\r\nthat there are definite circumstances which determine our exoneural\r\napprehension to direct itself upon this or that object or person.\r\n\r\nSo, in common perception, the exoneural apprehension probably moves\r\nback along the lines of material impression, to reach the object\r\nperceived, which so attracts it.\r\n\r\nSo, in sudden liking or aversion at first sight—or, more properly, on\r\nall occasions of meeting strangers—an exoneural mingling of reciprocal\r\nappreciation takes place; different persons being differently gifted\r\nwith intuitive discernment, as others or the same with powers of\r\npleasingly affecting most they meet.\r\n\r\nSo Zschokke’s seer-gift would have been but the result of a greater\r\nexoneural mobility of his mind, whereby he was occasionally drawn to\r\nsuch mental affinity with a stranger, that he knew his whole life and\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSo in panic fears, in all cases where impressions seem heightened\r\nby the sympathy of many, the power of psychical attraction we may\r\npresume to be increased by its concentration on one subject, and the\r\nparticipation of all in one thought. The Rev. Hare Townshend, in his\r\ninteresting work on mesmerism, declares that he has more than once\r\nsucceeded in the following fact of sympathetic mental influence. All\r\nthe members of a party then present have conspired against an expected\r\nvisiter; and when he came—carefully, at the same time, abstaining from\r\nalluding to some special subject agreed on—they have striven silently\r\nand mentally to drive it into his thoughts; and in a short time he has\r\nspoken of it.\r\n\r\n3. For the most lucid persons in waking-trance (either of spontaneous\r\noccurrence, as in catelepsy, or when induced by mesmerism) the\r\nexoneural apprehension seems to extend to every object and person\r\nround, and to be drawn into complete intelligence of or with them. Such\r\na patient is “en rapport,” or in trance-mental relation with any or\r\nevery thing around, in succession or simultaneously.\r\n\r\n4. In persons slowly waking in the most measured course of things out\r\nof artificial initiatory trance into somnambulism, the mind is at first\r\nexoneurally attracted to the mesmeriser alone. As a next step, the\r\nmesmeriser, by putting himself in Od-relation with a third person, can\r\nmake him participator in the same attraction.\r\n\r\nI do not here discuss Mr. Braid’s views, which are more fully\r\nconsidered in a subsequent Letter. I have analyzed trance in its\r\ncharacter of a spontaneous pathological phenomenon. I have examined\r\nits principal features as they present themselves when it is induced\r\nby mesmerism. But facts have been brought forward by Mr. Braid, which\r\nseem to establish that, in some highly susceptible persons, trance may\r\nbe brought on at will in another way, by their own indirect efforts,\r\napart from external influences:—as, for instance, by straining the eyes\r\nupwards, the attention being kept some time concentrated on the object\r\nor the effort. Certainly, doing this makes the head feel uncomfortable\r\nand giddy, and seems as if it would lead to some kind of fit if\r\nindefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nXIII. _Trance-Prevision_.—Instances of trance-prevision are referrible\r\nto three different heads.\r\n\r\n1. The simplest trance-prevision is that of epileptic patients\r\n(artificially entranced) who name, at the distance of weeks beforehand,\r\nthe exact hour, nay, minute, at which the next fit will occur. The\r\ncase of Cazot, (mentioned by Dr. Foissac,) who was in the habit\r\nof predicting the accession of his fits with unerring precision,\r\nterminated, however, in the following manner: Cazot had predicted, as\r\nusual, when he should be next attacked: before the time came round,\r\nhowever, he was thrown from a horse and killed. But no doubt can be\r\nentertained that, had he not met with this accident, the next fit\r\nwould have occurred at the hour predicted. This is the simplest and\r\nnarrowest form of prevision: the clairvoyante can tell, in reference to\r\nhimself, or to any one with whom he is placed in relation, what will be\r\nthe course of his health. He can see forward what the progress of his\r\nliving economy will be, _other things continuing the same_.\r\n\r\n2. The next feat is greater. Dr. Teste, in his most interesting\r\n_Manuel de Magnétisme Animal_, gives the case of a lady, his patient,\r\nwho, when entranced, foretold the day and hour when an accident, the\r\nnature of which she could not foresee, was to befall her, and from\r\nit a long series of illness was to take its rise. Dr. Teste and the\r\nlady’s husband were staying with her when the fatal moment approached.\r\nThen she rose, and, making an excuse, left the room, followed by her\r\nhusband; when, on opening a door, a great gray rat rushed out, and she\r\nsank down in a fit of terror, and the predicted illness ensued. In\r\nthis most decisive case, the prevision extended to an extraneous and\r\naccidental circumstance, to which no calculation or intuition of her\r\nnatural bodily changes could have led her.\r\n\r\n3. But there are instances which reach yet farther. Dr. Foissac\r\nnarrates the case of a Mdlle. Cœline, who, when entranced, predicted\r\nthat she would be poisoned on a certain evening, at a given hour.\r\nWhat would be the vehicle of the poison she could not foresee, either\r\nat the time when she first uttered the prediction, or on an occasion\r\nor two afterwards, when, being again entranced, she recurred to the\r\nsubject. However, shortly before the day she was to be poisoned, being\r\nquestioned in trance as to the possibility of averting her fate, she\r\nsaid, “Throw me into the sleep a little before the time I have named,\r\nand then ask me whether I can discern where the danger lies.” This was\r\ndone, and Mdlle. Cœline at once said that the poison was in a glass\r\nat her bed-side—they had substituted for quinine an excessive dose of\r\nmorphine.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that persons in waking trance can, first, calculate\r\nwhat is naturally to follow in their own health, or in that of persons\r\nwith whom they are in mesmeric relation; can, secondly, foretell the\r\noccurrence of fortuitous external events, without seeing how to prevent\r\nthem; can, thirdly, when endowed with more lucidity, discern enough to\r\nenable them occasionally to counteract the natural course of external\r\nevents. Fate thus becomes a contingency of certainties. There is a true\r\nseries of consequences to be deduced from whatever partial premises the\r\nclairvoyante may happen to be acquainted with. When she has more data,\r\nshe makes a wider calculation, certain as far as it goes. But other\r\npremises, influencing the ultimate result, may still have escaped her.\r\nSo the utmost reach of genuine trance-prevision is but the announcement\r\nof a probability, which unforeseen events may counteract.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this head by introducing M. Alexis’s account of his own\r\npowers of mesmeric prevision, in which the reader will see that his\r\nexperience has led him to view his conclusions as calculations upon\r\ncertain positive elements; yet he admits the possibility of powers\r\ngreater than his own: “On peut prévoir l’avenir,” said M. Alexis;\r\n“mais lorsque cet avenir a des fondations positives. Mais annoncer un\r\nfait isolé, un accident, une catastrophe, non. Cependant quelquefois\r\ncela est arrivé aux individus, mais c’étaient des instruments de la\r\nDivinité: ces hommes sont rares. Etant à une maison de jeu, je sçaurais\r\nd’avance la couleur gagnante, surtout aux cartes. Mais à la roulette\r\ncela me semble très difficile. Cela est de l’avenir. Les cartes, au\r\ncontraire, sont dans les mains d’un homme quelques minutes. Cependant\r\nsi l’on voulait appliquer la clairvoyance à une exploitation semblable,\r\nje suis materiellement et moralement certain que la vue ferait faute.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. _Ultra-terrestrial Vision._—If a clairvoyante can discern what\r\nis passing at the distance of one hundred leagues, why should not his\r\nperception extend to material objects beyond our sphere?\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson tried to conduct one of his clairvoyantes mentally\r\nto the moon; but, having got some way, she declared the moon was so\r\nintolerably bright, that the effort pained and distressed her, and\r\naccordingly Mr. Williamson relinquished the experiment, and happened\r\nnot to renew it.\r\n\r\nM. Alexis, when entranced, in answer to my inquiries, declared himself\r\ncognizant of the condition of the planets. He said that they were\r\ninhabited, with the exception of those which are either too near to, or\r\ntoo remote from the sun. He said that the inhabitants of the different\r\nplanets are very diverse; that the earth is the best off, for that man\r\nhas double the intelligence of the ruling animals in the other planets.\r\nIt would be the height of credulity to regard this communication as\r\nmore than a clever guess; yet a plausible guess it is, for if the other\r\nplanets are composed of the same material elements with the earth, it\r\nis evident that the temperature of our planet must render these same\r\nmaterials more generally available for life and economic purposes on it\r\nthan they would be in Mercury or Saturn.\r\n\r\nXV. _Ultra-vital Vision._—The following is M. Alexis’s\r\ntrance-revelation as to the state of the soul after death. I presume it\r\nis no more than an ingenious play of his fancy; but a young clergyman\r\nof some acumen, to whom I communicated it, was half disposed to give\r\nit more credit, and observed, with logical precision, that, viewing\r\nthe statement as an intuition, it would show the necessity of the\r\nresurrection of the body.\r\n\r\n“L’âme ne change jamais. Après la mort elle retourne à la Divinité.\r\nDieu a voulu attacher l’âme au corps, qui est un prison où Dieu a voulu\r\nenfermer l’âme pendant qu’elle est sur la terre. L’âme ne perd jamais\r\nson individualité. Après la mort, nos souvenirs ne nous restent pas.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is that to which my friend’s remark principally\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. _Nature of the Supreme Being._—The following striking expressions\r\nwere made use of by M. Alexis, when entranced, in answer to a string\r\nof questions which I had sent to him on this subject. He declared, at\r\nthe same time, that he had never before been led to consider it in\r\nhis mesmeric state. I presume, therefore, that in his ordinary waking\r\nstate he is a Spinozist, and that, in place of an intuition, he simply\r\ndelivered an oracular announcement of his preconceived notions:—\r\n\r\n“Il n’y a pas de parole humaine qui peut donner une idée de la\r\nDivinité. Dieu c’est tout. Il n’a pas de personalité. Dieu est partout\r\net nulle part. Dieu est le foyer qui allume la nature. Dieu est\r\nun foyer universel, dont les hommes ne sont que la vapeur la plus\r\néloignée, la plus faible. Chaque homme est l’extremité d’un rayon de\r\nLui-même. Il n’existe que Dieu.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\n THE ODOMETER OR DIVINING-RING.—How come upon by the author—His first\r\n experiments—The phenomena an objective proof of the reality of the\r\n Od-force.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Qualis ab incepto” shall be the motto of this twelfth letter, the\r\nmaterials of which were undreamt of by me, when some three months ago I\r\nremitted the new and corrected edition of “the Letters” to England. The\r\noccasion which led me to the knowledge of the facts I have to mention,\r\nand their bearing, tally curiously with what has gone before.\r\n\r\nFor it is again winter, with its long, solitary evenings, against the\r\ntedium of which I had to seek a resource; and I bethought me, this\r\ntime, of occupying myself with looking into the higher mathematics.\r\nAccordingly I sent to Herr Caspari, professor of mathematics in the\r\ngymnasium at Boppard, to solicit him to give me the instruction and\r\nassistance which I needed. And he obligingly came, in the evening\r\nof the 31st of December, to sit by my side and converse with me.\r\nAnd I went over preliminarily my schoolboy recollections of the\r\nelements of mathematics, and was pleased at finding the remembered\r\ndifficulties vanish before the explanations of my well-informed tutor.\r\nAnd I learned, to my vast delight, that the inability under which\r\nasymptotes labour to touch hyperbolas is a purely arbitrary one, like\r\nthe legislative prohibition not to marry with one’s deceased wife’s\r\nsister; but that, unlike the latter, it can be evaded; inasmuch as\r\nan asymptote, by changing its name and forfeiting its properties,\r\nmay at any time unite itself with the object to which it had before\r\nbeen infinitely near. Again, I found my boyish distrust and disbelief\r\nin sines and cosines replaced by an intelligent and well-satisfied\r\nacquaintance with them. And I even obtained a glimpse of the higher\r\nanalysis itself, pointing with its unerring finger to the exact height,\r\nelse unmeasurable, at which my candle should stand in the centre of my\r\nround table, to shed upon it its maximum of illumination.\r\n\r\nA liberal hour being over, and my dolphin-like recreation ended, my new\r\nfriend entered into desultory chat, and asked me, among other things,\r\nif I had not written something on the divining-rod. I replied to his\r\nquestion by giving him the copy I had of “the Letters;” and promised,\r\nas a New-Year’s gift for the morrow, to present him with the implement\r\nitself. And I lent him Von Reichenbach’s book on Od, with which he was\r\nunacquainted. Then he told me that there were two or three experiments,\r\npossibly akin to trials with the divining-rod, with which he had been\r\nfamiliar for years, and which he had shown to many without receiving an\r\nexplanation of them. He said that as far as he knew they were original\r\nand his own; and that he would willingly show them to me. He wanted\r\nonly for that purpose a piece of silver, a gold ring, and a bit of\r\nsilk. These were easily found. And he attached the silk to the ring,\r\nwhich he then held suspended by the silk over a silver spoon, at a\r\ndistance of half an inch.\r\n\r\nShortly the ring shaped its first vague movements into regular\r\noscillations in a direction to and fro, or towards and from, Herr\r\nCaspari. I will call such oscillations _longitudinal_. It was evident\r\nto me, that this phenomenon must be akin to the motion of the\r\ndivining-rod.\r\n\r\nThen, at Herr Caspari’s suggestion, I summoned the maid, who was\r\ndirected to place her hand in Herr Caspari’s disengaged hand. On\r\nher doing so, the oscillations of the ring became _transverse_. How\r\npregnant was this fact! An Od-current had been established between the\r\ntwo experimenters; and the apparent influence of the two metals on each\r\nother had been modified.\r\n\r\nHerr Caspari told me that, as far as he knew, these experiments would\r\nonly succeed when made with silver and gold, and a bit of silk. But he\r\nsaid that he had still another experiment to show me, which he did the\r\nfollowing day. He said he had a little pea-like bit of something, which\r\nhe had been told was _schwefel-kies_, that exhibited another motion:\r\nwhen held suspended by silk over either of the fingers, it rotated one\r\nway; when held suspended over the thumb, it rotated in the contrary\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHerr Caspari left me, after agreeing to assist me in the further\r\nexamination of these phenomena; and the New Year coming in found me\r\nin busy thought how to elicit, through variations of Herr Caspari’s\r\nexperiments, some important physical evidence as to the reality and\r\nagency of Von Reichenbach’s Od-force.\r\n\r\nIn ten days we have succeeded in disentangling the confused results\r\nwhich attended our first experiments; and as I see no likelihood of\r\nextending them at present in any new direction, I present them to\r\nthe reader now, as complete as I can at present render them. I have\r\nused the term “divining-ring,” partly because I have a vague idea of\r\nhaving seen Herr Caspari’s first facts adverted to in some publication\r\nunder that name; partly because it is really thus far deserved:—If you\r\nplace a piece of silver on a table, and lay over the table and it an\r\nunfolded silk pocket-handkerchief, you can discover where the silver\r\nlies by trying with the suspended ring each part of the surface. The\r\nring will only oscillate when held over the silver. But now I have to\r\nsubstitute another name for the sake of precision.\r\n\r\nA fragment of any thing, of any shape, suspended either by silk or\r\ncotton thread, the other end of which is wound round the first joint\r\neither of the forefinger or of the thumb, I will call an _Odometer_.\r\nThe length of the thread does not matter. It must be sufficient to\r\nallow the ring, or whatever it is, to reach to about half an inch from\r\nthe table, against which you rest your arm or elbow to steady your\r\nhand. If there be nothing on the table, the ring or its equivalent soon\r\nbecomes stationary. Then you test the powers of the odometer by placing\r\nupon the table under it what substances you please. These I would call\r\n_Od-subjects_.\r\n\r\nTo obtain uniform results with the Odometer, it is important to attach\r\nthe sustaining thread always to the same finger of the same hand,—best\r\nto the forefinger of the right hand. It is evident that this rule\r\nis not to prevent the experimenter, when he has succeeded in thus\r\nobtaining a series of consistent results, from trying what will come of\r\nsubstituting his other digits for that first employed.\r\n\r\nI have armed the odometer with gold, silver, lead, zinc, iron, copper;\r\nwith coal, bone, horn, dry wood, charcoal, cinder, glass, soap, wax,\r\nsealing-wax, shell-lac, sulphur, earthenware. As Od-subjects I have\r\nlikewise tried most of the substances above enumerated. All do not go\r\nequally well, or perform exactly the same feats, with each odometer.\r\nFor example, an odometer of dry wood remains stationary over gold;\r\nwhile it oscillates with great vivacity over glass. The respective\r\nhabitudes of different odometers to different Od-subjects is one of the\r\nsimplest points of investigation which the facts I am narrating suggest.\r\n\r\nA gold ring with a plain stone in it was the first odometer which\r\nI employed, and it is one of the most largely available. And gold\r\nforms in general the most successful Od-subject. Sulphur likewise\r\ndisplays very lively motions in the odometer. But the material which\r\nI finally employed to verify the following phenomena was shell-lac, a\r\nportion a full inch long, broader towards the lower end, then cut to\r\nbe lancet-shaped. The odometer moves more sluggishly with some than\r\nwith others, and in the same hand on different days; and doubtless\r\nis capable of manifesting a greater variety of effects than I have\r\nyet elicited from it. I can only pledge myself to the certainty of my\r\nbeing always now able to obtain with the shell-lac odometer all the\r\nresults mentioned in the XXVII. experiments which first follow. Over\r\nrock-crystal, however, the shell-lac odometer acts very feebly; but a\r\nglass odometer moves with brilliant vivacity. I would besides advise\r\nthe reader to try a gold-ring odometer, in preference, for experiments\r\nX., XI., XII., XIII.\r\n\r\nThen here are the results:—\r\n\r\nI. Odometer (we will suppose armed with shell-lac) held over three\r\nsovereigns heaped loosely together to form the Od-subject; the odometer\r\nsuspended from the right forefinger of a competent person of the male\r\nsex. _Result_—Longitudinal oscillations.\r\n\r\nII. Let the experimenter, continuing experiment I., take with\r\nhis unengaged hand the hand of a person of the opposite sex.\r\n_Result_—Transverse oscillations of the odometer.\r\n\r\nIII. Then, the experiment being continued, let a person of the sex of\r\nthe experimenter take and hold the unengaged hand of the second party.\r\n_Result_—Longitudinal oscillations of the odometer.\r\n\r\nIV. Repeat experiment I., and, the longitudinal oscillations being\r\nestablished, touch the forefinger which is engaged in the odometer with\r\nthe forefinger of your other hand. _Result_—The oscillations become\r\ntransverse.\r\n\r\nV. Repeat experiment I., and, the longitudinal oscillations being\r\nestablished, bring the thumb of the same hand into contact with the\r\nfinger implicated in the odometer. _Result_—The oscillations become\r\ntransverse.\r\n\r\nVI. Then, continuing experiment V., let a person of the same sex take\r\nand hold your unengaged hand. _Result_—The oscillations become again\r\nlongitudinal.\r\n\r\nVII. Experiment I. being repeated, take and hold in your disengaged\r\nhand two or three sovereigns. _Result_—The oscillations become\r\ntransverse.\r\n\r\nVIII. Continuing experiment VII., let a person of the same sex take and\r\nhold your hand which holds the sovereigns. _Result_—The oscillations\r\nbecome longitudinal.\r\n\r\nIX. If the odometer be attached to the thumb instead of to the\r\nforefinger, it oscillates longitudinally; but on approaching the thumb\r\nso as to touch the forefinger, the oscillations become of course\r\ntransverse.\r\n\r\nX. Repeat experiment I., but let the Od-subject be a double row\r\nof five sovereigns, each disposed longitudinally from you, and\r\nhold the odometer over the middle of the double row of sovereigns.\r\n_Result_—Longitudinal oscillations, but the excursions are inordinately\r\nlong. Still, on touching the forefinger with the thumb, the\r\noscillations become either transverse, or the odometer moves in an\r\nellipse, of which the long axis corresponds with the axis of the double\r\nline of sovereigns.\r\n\r\nXI. Dispose ten sovereigns longitudinally from you in two parallel\r\nrows, an inch and a half apart, and hold the odometer over the middle\r\nof the interval. _Result_—Longitudinal oscillations.\r\n\r\nXII. Modify experiment XI. by holding the odometer not midway, but\r\nnearer one of the rows of sovereigns. _Result_—Oblique oscillations.\r\n\r\nXIII. Dispose ten sovereigns heaped in a short longitudinal group, and\r\nhold the odometer over the table half an inch to one side of the middle\r\nof the heap. _Result_—Transverse oscillations.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter experiments and their modifications, it became evident\r\nthat the magnitude and shape of the Od-subject have each a direct\r\ninfluence on the result. A greater force of attraction evidently exists\r\ntowards the greater mass.\r\n\r\nXIV. Odometer held over the northward pole of a magnetic needle\r\ncontained in a compass-box under glass. _Result_—Rotatory motion in the\r\ndirection of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nXV. Odometer held over the southward pole. _Result_—Rotatory motion in\r\nthe direction contrary to the motion of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nXVI. Repeat experiments XIV. and XV., with the difference of touching\r\nthe forefinger implicated in the odometer with the thumb of the same\r\nhand. _Results_—The rotatory motions observed in the two experiments\r\nreferred to become exactly reversed.\r\n\r\nXVII. Hold the odometer over the centre of the needle.\r\n_Result_—Oscillations at right angles, or transverse, to the axis of\r\nthe needle.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Hold the odometer over, and half an inch to one side of, the\r\ncentre of the needle. _Result_—Oscillations parallel to the axis of the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nXIX. Repeat experiment XIV. Then, during its continuance, place a pile\r\nof three sovereigns on the compass-box, in front of the northward\r\npole of the needle, and about an inch from it. _Result_—Direction of\r\noriginal rotatory motion reversed.\r\n\r\nThen follow experiments with results exactly parallel to the preceding,\r\nhaving the greatest physiological interest.\r\n\r\nXX. Hold the odometer over the tip of the forefinger of your disengaged\r\nhand. _Result_—Rotatory motion in the direction of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nXXI. Hold the odometer over the thumb of your disengaged hand.\r\n_Result_—Rotatory motion against that of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nXXII. Hold up the forefinger and thumb of the disengaged hand, their\r\npoints being at two and a half inches apart. Hold the odometer in the\r\ncentre of a line which would join the points of the finger and thumb.\r\n_Result_—Oscillations transverse to the line indicated.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Modify the preceding experiment by holding the odometer half\r\nan inch to one side of, and over, the middle of the line indicated.\r\n_Result_—Oscillations parallel to the said line.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Modify experiment XXIII. by approximating the ends of the\r\nforefinger and thumb of the disengaged hand, so that they touch.\r\n_Result_—The odometer no longer moves.\r\n\r\nXXV. Forefinger and thumb of the disengaged hand held upwards and\r\napart, sustaining a short file longwise between them. Odometer then\r\nheld over the last joint of the finger. _Result_—Odometer stationary.\r\nOdometer then held over the last joint of the thumb. _Result_—Odometer\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Odometer held over the northward pole of the magnetic needle, and\r\nits consequent rotatory motion in the direction of that of the hands\r\nof a watch established. Then advance the finger or the thumb of the\r\nother hand towards the odometer. (The odometer should be held in these\r\nexperiments half an inch above, and a little wide of, or before, the\r\napex of the needle.) The finger, or the thumb, is then to be brought\r\nas near to the odometer as is consistent with not touching it in its\r\nrotation. _Result_—Direction of the rotation reversed. Then join the\r\nfinger and thumb, and hold the two thus brought into contact in the\r\nsame proximity to the odometer. _Result_—The rotation returns to the\r\nformer direction; that is, to the direction of the motion of the hands\r\nof a watch.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Odometer held over the radial (or thumb) edge of the wrist.\r\n_Result_—The same as when held over thumb. Odometer held over the\r\nlittle-finger edge of the wrist. _Result_—The same as when held over\r\neither of the fingers. This difference in result extends a third the\r\nlength of the fore-arm, over the middle of which the odometer becomes\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. A portion of rock-crystal five inches long, about two wide\r\nand deep, placed on the table with its long axis transverse to the\r\noperator. Glass odometer held over the middle of the upper plain\r\nsurface. _Result_—Oscillations parallel to the axis of the crystal.\r\nPosition of the crystal shifted, so as to make its axis point _from_\r\nthe operator. _Result_—Oscillations as before parallel to the axis of\r\nthe crystal, but longitudinal to the operator. Then the thumb applied\r\nto the forefinger. _Result_—Transverse oscillations.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Glass odometer held suspended over one apex of the crystal.\r\n_Result_—Rotatory motion in the direction of the hands of a watch.\r\nOdometer held over the opposite end. _Result_—Rotation in the direction\r\ncontrary to that of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nXXX. The last experiment repeated. The forefinger of the operator’s\r\nunengaged hand brought near to the odometer in each of its two\r\nvarieties. _Result_—The previous rotatory motion reversed. Then the\r\npoint of the thumb brought into contact with the odometer finger.\r\n_Result_—The original rotatory motion re-established.\r\n\r\nI will add in reference to the first and simplest experiments, that the\r\ninterposition of several folds of silk between the Od-subject and the\r\nodometer renders the motions of the latter less brisk.\r\n\r\nThe development which I have thus given to the few, isolated, and\r\nlong-hoarded experiments of Herr Caspari, was not so simple an\r\naffair as it may seem to be. For several days I was in doubt as to\r\nthe genuineness of the results, so capricious and contradictory were\r\nthey. It was only when I had discovered, first, the reversing effect\r\nof touching the odometer finger with the thumb of the same hand, and,\r\nsecondly, that approaching the thumb towards the odometer finger, or\r\neven allowing the other fingers of the odometer hand to close upon\r\nthe ball of the thumb, has the same effect with bringing the point\r\nof the thumb into contact with the odometer finger, that I succeeded\r\nin obtaining unvarying results. The interest of these experiments is\r\nunquestionably very considerable. They open a new vein of research, and\r\nestablish a new bond of connexion between physical and physiological\r\nscience, which cannot fail to promote the advancement of both. They\r\ncontribute a mass of objective and physical evidence to give support\r\nand substantiality to the subjective results of Von Reichenbach’s\r\nexperiments. They tend to prove the existence of some universal force,\r\nsuch as that to which he has given theoretical form and consistence\r\nunder the designation of Od. And such a universal force, what other can\r\nwe deem it to be than the long-vilipended influence of Mesmer, rendered\r\nbright and transparent and palatable by passing through the filter of\r\nscience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.\r\n\r\n THE SOLUTION.—Examination of the genuineness of the\r\n phenomena—Od-motions produced by bodies in their most inert\r\n state—Analysis of the forces which originate them—Od-motions\r\n connected with electrical, magnetic, chemical, crystalline, and vital\r\n influences—Their analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present letter might be entitled “An account of some motions\r\nrecently discovered, to the manifestation of which an influence\r\nproceeding from the living human body is necessary.” The contrivance by\r\nwhich these motions are elicited I have called an Odometer, from the\r\nconviction that the force which sets it in movement is no other than\r\nthe Od-force of Von Reichenbach. For the same reason I have called the\r\nobjects with which it is tested Od-subjects, and the motions themselves\r\nOd-motions.\r\n\r\nThe odometer is a pendulum, formed of a ring, or other small body\r\nattached to a thread, the other end of which is wound round a finger\r\nor the thumb. The odometer employed in the following experiments was\r\na light gold ring, having a greater mass of metal on the unattached\r\nside, and suspended to the last joint of the right forefinger, the\r\nsuspending medium being either silk, or fine cotton, or the hair of\r\na horse. The experiments were made by myself. In order to avoid the\r\nconfusion resulting from a multiplicity of details, I shall state the\r\nresults obtained through testing a limited number only of Od-subjects,\r\nso selected as to represent the leading divisions of the provinces of\r\nnature, and of dynamics. With some of the principal the reader will\r\nbe already acquainted through Letter XII., the contents of which will\r\nhave prepared him for, and probably suggested to him, the following\r\nquestion, as a desirable subject of preliminary consideration.\r\n\r\nI. Are the motions referred to worth examining at all? Are they\r\nmore than the simple results of impulses conveyed to the pendulum\r\nby movements of the hand or wrist, or some general sway of the\r\nexperimenter’s person, unintentionally going with the expectation or\r\nconception of this or that motion of the ring? Such a solution of the\r\nphenomena is not wanting in probability. It is metaphysically and\r\nphysically certain, that when we maintain one and the same bodily\r\nposture or gesture, as in standing, sitting, or holding out the hand,\r\nwhatever be the seeming continuousness and unity of the effort, the\r\nposture or gesture is really maintained only by a series of rapidly\r\nsucceeding efforts. What is more likely than that, in such a continual\r\nrenewing of voluntary actions, our fancy, or the sympathy between our\r\nwill and our thoughts, should give a bias to the results, even when we\r\nmost try to neutralize its influence? The fact which I propose first\r\nto mention is in complete agreement with this view. I can at will\r\ncause the odometer to move exactly as I please. Although I hold my\r\nhand as steadily as possible by leaning the arm against a table, and\r\nendeavour to keep my person absolutely still, yet I have only to form\r\na vivid conception of a new path for the odometer, and a motion in\r\nthe so-imagined direction is almost immediately substituted for that\r\nwhich was before going on. In like manner, I have only to conceive\r\nthe cessation of motion, and the odometer gradually stops. I must\r\nfarther admit that my first trials of the odometer were made under\r\nthe full expectation that the results which ensued would follow. And\r\nI cannot say that it is impossible, that when other and new motions\r\nemerged, they were not often either realizations of a previous guess,\r\nor repetitions on the same principle of what occurred at first as an\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am not unprepared with an array of facts which\r\nseem to me capable not only of neutralizing the force of the preceding\r\nargument, but of making it appear, most likely, that some other\r\ninfluence than that of the experimenter’s mind is often in operation\r\nin bringing about these results; an influence sufficiently curious,\r\nas I think, to justify me in continuing this investigation and the\r\npresent letter. I beg the reader’s candid construction of the following\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nIf, when trying the odometer, I have caused it, by conceiving a\r\ndifferent motion, to change its path and move in a _wrong_ direction,\r\nI now endeavour to divert my mind from considering its motion at all,\r\nthe odometer invariably resumes its previous _right_ movement. It\r\nis, indeed, difficult to observe a strict mental neutrality in this\r\ninstance. For the odometer moves imperfectly and uncertainly, unless I\r\nfrequently look at its performance. Or, as I interpret the fact, unless\r\nI keep my attention fixed to a certain extent on what I am doing, my\r\nhand loses its steadiness, and communicates all sorts of distracting\r\nimpulses to the pendulum. And the uncertainty hence arising admits, it\r\nappears to me, of being obviated by the comparison of numerous careful\r\nrepetitions of the experiments.\r\n\r\nMany of the motions which I at first thought were genuine Od-results,\r\nI afterwards found out I had been mistaken in. And the correction of\r\nthese errors was mostly due to frequent and careful repetitions of\r\nthe experiments, unattended by an expectation of finding the results\r\nreversed or otherwise modified, and instituted simply to secure their\r\ngenuineness and certainty.\r\n\r\nThen there was one result which at one time I confidently anticipated;\r\nbut it never came up. I had found the ring make gyrations in the\r\ndirection of those of the hands of a watch, when held over the small\r\nend of a living unincubated egg. Opposite gyrations were obtained\r\nover the big end. I thought this might have to do with the sex of the\r\nembryo. And I tried, accordingly, a dozen eggs, expecting that in some\r\nthe direction of the gyrations at the two ends would be reversed. But\r\nthis event never occurred, much as I laid myself out for it. If my\r\nfancy could have decided the matter in spite of my care to prevent\r\nits interference, I am clear that for a time, at least, I should have\r\nobtained in these experiments upon the egg a double set of results.\r\nI was much delighted two months later at coming upon the explanation\r\nof the question, why gyration like that of the hands of a watch is\r\nmanifested at the little end of the egg. I had known from nearly the\r\nfirst that this direction of the rotatory Od-motion is manifested when\r\nthe pendulum is swung over the right side of the human body. Then I\r\nfell upon an old physiological reminiscence, (and found a drawing of\r\nthe fact in my outlines of Physiology,) that the embryo chick lies in\r\nthe egg transversely upon its face, with its right side towards the\r\nlittle end.\r\n\r\nThen there were two other results, which were directly at variance\r\nwith my anticipations, but which never failed to present themselves.\r\nI made a voltaic arrangement by means of two plates, one of zinc, the\r\nother of copper, fixed in contact in a solution of salt in water. Now,\r\nwhen held opposite the middle of the zinc disc, the odometer always\r\nrotated like the hands of a watch; while over the copper disc the\r\nphenomenon was reversed. These results are constant. But I have had\r\nthe satisfaction of lately discovering that, if I present the ring to\r\nany part of the _circumference_ of the two discs, its motion is the\r\nopposite, and in accordance with theory.\r\n\r\nOne of the tests on which I have much relied in determining whether\r\nthe motions I obtained were genuine Od-motions, consisted in producing\r\ntheir reversal by altering the Od-relations of my hand or of my\r\nperson. What gives particular value to this test is, that the versed\r\nor complimentary motion is subject to different laws. One set of\r\nsecondary oscillations changes into oscillations in a plane at right\r\nangles to the plane of the primary oscillations. In another series the\r\nmotion continues in the same plane; but the excursions, which were\r\nbefore longest in one direction, are now longest in the opposite, as\r\nif a repellent current had been substituted for an attracting one. The\r\nOd-oscillations, it may be observed, are always dependent upon the\r\naction of a constant rectilinear force counteracted by the gravitation\r\nof the pendulum. The means I usually employ to reverse the primary\r\nOd-motions is, bringing the end of the right thumb into contact with\r\nthe odometer-finger, where the thread is wound round it. But the\r\nexperimenter cannot be too careful not to bring the thumb even near\r\nto the odometer finger, or to allow his other fingers to close upon\r\nthe ball of the thumb, for the phenomena are thus again liable to be\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nThe other means of reversing the results of the experiments are:—\r\n\r\n _a._ To substitute a hair of a mare for the suspending media\r\n above-named.\r\n\r\n _b._ To hold a sovereign in the left hand.\r\n\r\n _c._ To apply the forefinger of the left hand to the odometer finger.\r\n\r\n _d._ To have either hand of a person of the same sex laid on your\r\n right hand or right ear.\r\n\r\n _e._ To have either hand of a person of the opposite sex laid upon\r\n your left hand or left ear.\r\n\r\nThe various substances employed as Od-subjects admit of being divided\r\ninto two great classes; one consisting of unorganized or organized\r\nbodies in which a minimum of internal activity is present; the other,\r\nof bodies of both classes, in which the more energetic properties of\r\nmatter are at work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. Let me first notice the results obtained with the first class of\r\nbodies. These, again, are reducible to two forms. The Od-subject may\r\neither be of a regular figure and equal thickness throughout—as a piece\r\nof money, for instance; or it may be of an irregular figure, with an\r\nunequal mass of matter at one part—as, for instance, when it consists\r\nof an aggregate of several pieces of money variously arranged. I shall\r\nfirst treat of the first and simpler case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt does not matter how you face in making these experiments. The\r\ninfluence of your person makes the various meridians of the Od-subject.\r\nThe movements which we have first to examine are the results of holding\r\nthe odometer over the middle of various uniform discs, such as I have\r\nsupposed. They consist of two series of oscillations—one directed\r\nlongitudinally to and from the experimenter; the other transversal,\r\nor in a plane at right angles to the plane of the first series of\r\noscillations. Then it is highly convenient to have terms denoting\r\nthe four cardinal points at which these oscillations cut the edge of\r\nthe circular disc. These points may be termed _distal_, _proximal_,\r\n_dextral_, _sinistral_. It will likewise be found convenient to have\r\nterms to denote the direction of the motions manifested. The terms\r\n_distad_, _proximad_, _dextrad_, _sinistrad_, will serve our purpose.\r\nThese terms refer to the person of the experimenter. Two other terms\r\nare still wanting; sometimes rotatory motion supervenes, which maybe\r\neither in the direction of the motion of the hands of a watch, or the\r\nreverse. I call the first of these two motions _clock-rotation_, the\r\nsecond _versed-rotation_.\r\n\r\nThe present class of Od-subjects present the following remarkable\r\ndifferences among themselves:—\r\n\r\nOver one class, including gold, zinc, and polished glass, a circular\r\nmass of bicarbonate of soda, the odometer primarily oscillates\r\n_longitudinally_.\r\n\r\nWith the other class, which includes pearl, ground glass, copper, a\r\ncircular mass of tartaric acid, the odometer held over the centre\r\nprimarily oscillates _transversely_.\r\n\r\nOver polished glass, an odometer of resin oscillates transversely; over\r\nground glass longitudinally.\r\n\r\nEach of these movements is replaced by the other, when the thumb is\r\nbrought into contact with the odometer-finger. (See figs. 1 and 2, in\r\nwhich the continuous line represents the primary motion; the dotted\r\nline, the secondary or complementary or reversed motion.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. Analysis of the forces, or currents conducing to, or implicated in\r\nthe movements of the odometer just described.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the above movements manifest themselves when the\r\nodometer is held over the centre of the Od-subject. Let us now examine\r\nthe consequences of holding the odometer extra-marginally to, or beyond\r\nthe edge of, the Od-subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing figs. 1-8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing figs. 9-14]\r\n\r\n _a._ Let the odometer be held a quarter of an inch away from, and\r\n over each cardinal point of a sovereign, or zinc circular disc,\r\n in succession. _Result_—Held near the distal point, its motion is\r\n _proximad_. Held near the proximal point, its motion is _proximad_.\r\n Held near the dextral point, its motion is _sinistrad_. Held near the\r\n sinistral point, its motion is _sinistrad_. (See fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nBut the first two impulses thus attained correspond with the direction\r\nof the primary oscillations of the odometer, the last two with its\r\ncomplementary oscillations; and if the odometer be held now over\r\ndifferent points in succession of the two diametral lines, suspended,\r\nof course, by the finger alone over the first series of points, and\r\nby the finger touched by the thumb over the second, it will be found\r\nthat the primary oscillations originated over every point of the\r\nlongitudinal diameter of the zinc disc are proximad; and that those\r\nobtainable over any part of the transverse diameter of the zinc disc\r\nare sinistrad.\r\n\r\nThen the forces or currents are made manifest by which the two sets of\r\noscillations are produced; and the marvel of the prompt substitution\r\nof one for the other is at an end; for it is evident that these\r\ntwo forces, whether produced or only revealed by the presence of\r\nthe odometer, co-exist; and that the changed Od-relations of the\r\nexperimenter to the odometer, (effected by disjoining the thumb from,\r\nor joining it to, the forefinger,) simply act by giving temporary\r\npredominance to one of the two co-existent currents.\r\n\r\nIf these experiments be made at the edge of the copper disc, they\r\nelicit opposite but parallel results. (See fig. 4.) They evince the\r\nexistence of two currents, one _dextrad_, the other _sinistrad_, from\r\nwhich the same conclusions may be deduced.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice, that in all this class of the experiments,\r\nthe distad and dextrad currents are manifested in combination; and in\r\nlike manner the proximad and sinistrad.\r\n\r\nThis combination is further exemplified in the next experiment, which I\r\nshall describe.\r\n\r\n _b._ Excite the above extra-marginal motions of the odometer held\r\n near the two plates in succession; and then apply the thumb to the\r\n finger in each experiment. _Result_—Tangential motions are manifested\r\n parallel to the diametral motions before displayed. (See figs. 5 and\r\n 6.)\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, suppose these extra-marginal tangential motions\r\nto be the lateral limits of the four great currents, inasmuch as they\r\nare obtained by the versed process to that which obtains the central\r\nmotion; and the question arises, what then are the limits of the\r\ncentral currents?\r\n\r\n _c._ Hold the odometer over the zinc disc at its centre; of course,\r\n longitudinal oscillations determined by the proximad current manifest\r\n themselves. Then shift its place on the transverse diameter more and\r\n more to the left. _First Result_—For something more than a quarter of\r\n the whole diameter, the motion continues longitudinal, proving that\r\n the central current has a breadth at least something exceeding half\r\n the diameter. Same result on the other side of the centre. _Second\r\n Result_—When the odometer nears the sinistral cardinal point of\r\n the zinc disc, its longitudinal proximad motion is replaced by the\r\n motion I have called clock-rotation. When it is held near the dextral\r\n cardinal point, versed rotation manifests itself.\r\n\r\nThis second result establishes that the longitudinal proximad current\r\nextends laterally to the edges of the disc; but that, when near to\r\nthem, the force of the co-existing transverse current asserts itself,\r\ndriving the odometer (on the left) off in a sinistro-proximad diagonal,\r\nwhich ends in the establishment of clock-rotation; on the right driving\r\nthe central current off, in a dextro-proximad diagonal, resulting in\r\nversed rotation. (See fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nParallel and opposite results are obtained by the odometer when these\r\nexperiments are repeated with the copper disc; and necessarily the\r\nclock-rotation appears near the proximad margin of the disc, the versed\r\nrotation near the distal edge.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is evident that the great longitudinal and transverse\r\ncurrents extend over the whole disc, but not beyond it. Experiment _a_,\r\nsection II., and figs. 3 and 4, show that, immediately beyond the\r\ncardinal points, single forces are in operation.\r\n\r\nOther interesting results follow from trying with the odometer the\r\nextra-marginal spaces between the cardinal points.\r\n\r\n _d._ First let the central points between each pair of cardinal points\r\n be tried with the zinc disc. _Result_—(see fig. 9,)—a dextro-proximad\r\n current is manifested between the sinistral and distal points, and\r\n between the proximal and dextral points; a sinistro-proximad current\r\n is manifested between the dextral and distal, and between the proximal\r\n and sinistral points—giving the impression that there exist two\r\n diagonal forces, comparable to the longitudinal and transverse forces.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 gives the corresponding, but opposite, results obtained upon\r\nthe copper disc.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, doubtful whether these currents traverse the whole\r\ndisc. For if the experiment is made of following each upon the disc,\r\ntheir influence disappears at less than a quarter of the diameter,\r\nwhere the odometer is found to obey on the zinc disc the proximad\r\ncurrent, on the copper disc the dextrad current. Or, probably, these\r\ncurrents are the simple expression of the action of two equal forces\r\nmoving the body operated on by them (at right angles to each other)\r\nin the diagonal. These effects thus form a remarkable contrast with\r\nthe results given in figs. 7 and 8, wherein rotatory movements are\r\nmanifested; and they seem to show that an essential element in these\r\nrotatory movements is, that one of the two currents acting on the\r\nodometer must, in the latter case, be of superior force to the other.\r\n\r\n _e._ Repeat the last experiments versed, or with the thumb applied to\r\n the forefinger. _Results_—(see figs. 11 and 12)—Tangential forces are\r\n developed, the directions of which are opposite, as obtained over the\r\n zinc and over the copper discs.\r\n\r\n _f._ Repeat the extra-marginal trials of the odometer in all the\r\n halves of the inter-cardinal spaces, both with the zinc and with the\r\n copper discs. (See figs. 13 and 14.) _Result_—A complicated series of\r\n rotatory movements, eight for each disc; four in each case showing\r\n clock-rotation—four versed rotation—but opposite in the corresponding\r\n spaces of the two discs. On applying the thumb to the odometer finger,\r\n the rotations become exactly inverted so that, in that case; fig. 14\r\n represents what is now manifested in the zinc disc, fig. 13 what is\r\n now manifested in the copper disc.\r\n\r\nIII. Motions of the odometer obtained over the same class of\r\nsubstances, when of irregular figure and unequal thickness.\r\n\r\n _a._ Let the odometer be held over the middle of a line of four\r\n sovereigns disposed either longitudinally, transversely, or obliquely.\r\n _Result_—Long oscillations over the axis of the line of sovereigns.\r\n But the oscillations are not of equal length. At one end of the line\r\n they extend to the edge of the fourth sovereign. At the other, they\r\n pass an inch beyond it.\r\n\r\n _b._ Repeat the experiment, touching the odometer-finger with the\r\n right thumb. _Result_—Axial oscillations as before, and unequal as\r\n before, but in the contrary direction.\r\n\r\n _c._ Dispose four sovereigns in a line; then place two others upon any\r\n one of the four, and hold the odometer over the table at three inches\r\n to one side of the middle of the line. _Result_—The odometer swings\r\n in each instance towards that sovereign on which the two additional\r\n are placed—but unequally. We will suppose that it has swung with\r\n sufficient strength to reach the disc of the loaded sovereign,—the\r\n oscillation in the contrary direction is but two inches in length.\r\n\r\n _d._ Repeat the experiment, with the thumb applied.\r\n _Results_—Oscillations ensue of the same length, and they are again\r\n unequal, but in the contrary direction. Now they do not reach the pile\r\n of sovereigns by an inch, but they pass three inches in the opposite\r\n direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing figs. 15-24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing fisg 25-29]\r\n\r\nThus a force is brought into view having this new quality: when the\r\nOd-relations of the experimenter are versed, a change ensues, not into\r\nmotion in a plane transverse to the former one, but the direction of\r\nthe new motion is simply the opposite of the first, or the odometer\r\nappears to be attracted or repelled towards the Od-subject alternately.\r\n\r\n _e._ Try the same experiment with a single sovereign, or with the zinc\r\n disc. _Result_—The odometer held at four inches distance is attracted\r\n and repelled just as in the preceding instance.\r\n\r\nThen an irregular form of the Od-subject, or its unequal mass at\r\ndifferent parts, have nothing to do with this new motion; and it\r\nis evident that the relation of the latter to the former class of\r\noscillatory motions will be easily determinable.\r\n\r\n _f._ Lay the proper disc before you (see fig. 15,) and hold the\r\n odometer over the production in each direction of its transversal line\r\n beyond the limits of the disc. _Results_—When held near the right edge\r\n of the disc, as before mentioned, a dextrad motion is developed; that\r\n is to say, the odometer moves off from the dextral cardinal point of\r\n the disc, oscillatively. This movement, or those oscillations outward,\r\n are fainter and fainter, as the odometer is held over points more and\r\n more remote from the disc. At length, at the distance of an inch and a\r\n half, the odometer becomes absolutely stationary. When moved, however,\r\n still farther off, motion begins again, which is very lively at four\r\n to five inches distance from the disc, its direction being sensibly\r\n toward the disc. Moved farther off, still the same motion continues,\r\n and is detectable ten to twelve inches off the Od-subject.\r\n\r\nWhen the same experiments are made on the left edge of the Od-subject,\r\nphenomena just the reverse are manifested for the same distance. The\r\nextra-marginal dextrad motion is transverse for an inch and a half.\r\nThen there occurs a point of quiescence; on the other side of which\r\nthe odometer swings in free and long sinistrad or repelled oscillations.\r\n\r\n _g._ Repeat these experiments (fig. 16,) with the thumb applied.\r\n _Result_—On the left side the near extra-marginal dextrad motion\r\n is replaced by a tangential proximad motion; and the centrifugal\r\n oscillations beyond the point of quiescence are replaced by\r\n centripetal oscillations. On the right side again, the near dextrad\r\n extra-marginal oscillations are replaced by a proximad tangential\r\n current: while beyond the point of quiescence, the remote centripetal\r\n oscillations are reversed into centrifugal ones.\r\n\r\nEffects parallel to these are attained at each of the cardinal and\r\ninter-cardinal points of the whole circumference, upon the zinc or\r\ncopper disc, but as usual always reversed.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the eight intervening spaces, the character of the remote\r\nmotion is changed. _There_ it is a rotatory motion in a direction the\r\nreverse of the rotatory motion shown in figs. 15 and 16.\r\n\r\nThus, there exists all round the disc, at a distance of about an inch\r\nand a half, a circle of complete repose. Within this the proper, or\r\nnear, extra-marginal movements of the odometer are manifested: without\r\nit, the motions of the second and remote force last described.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the facts mentioned at the beginning of this section.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the odometer over a line of sovereigns, or from a\r\ndistance towards its centre of gravity, are evidently the consequences\r\nof this remote force coming into operation; the long and forcible\r\noscillations caused by which toward or from a remote point override\r\nthe smaller near extra-marginal, and the super-discal forces of the\r\nOd-subject.\r\n\r\nIV. I have next to deal with the effects obtained by trying the\r\nodometer with mineral bodies, in which electric, chemical, or magnetic\r\nforces are energizing, or that force on which crystalline structure\r\ndepends, and with organized bodies in possession of life.\r\n\r\nIn this section, I propose to describe the simple resultants, analogous\r\nto the two diametral movements, obtained when the odometer is held\r\nover a sovereign. It will be remembered that, of these two, one only\r\nmanifested itself at a time; and that their meridians were determined\r\nby the person of the experimenter. One movement was either in the\r\ndirection of the mesial plane of his person, or in one parallel to\r\nit—namely, the longitudinal oscillations; the other was in a plane at\r\nright angles to the first.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding movements of the odometer with the class of bodies\r\nnow to be considered are rotatory; and two, at least, are always\r\nsimultaneously manifested—one a clock rotation, the other a versed\r\nrotation. These opposite rotations are likewise always manifested on\r\nopposite sides or opposite ends of the Od-subject, indicating the\r\ndevelopment of polarity. Finally, the force of this polarity is such as\r\nto render the influence of the person of the experimenter nugatory as\r\nto the direction of the forces. Accordingly, if a horse-shoe magnet is\r\nlaid in any position in reference to the experimenter, clock-rotation\r\nis always obtained by holding the odometer half an inch above, and\r\nbeyond its northward pole; and versed rotation is invariably obtained\r\nin like manner at its southward pole. The effect of touching the\r\nodometer-finger with the thumb is exactly to reverse the two rotations.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the individual instances in which these rotations\r\nare manifested; or the parts of each Od-subject over which the odometer\r\nrotates in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n              CLOCK-ROTATION.                        VERSED-ROTATION.\r\n\r\n  _a._ A stick of sealing-wax excited       A glass tube similarly excited.\r\n     by friction with flannel or silk.\r\n     A glass tube excited by rubbing\r\n     it with fur.\r\n\r\n  _b._ The zinc disc of an arrangement      The copper disc of the same, the\r\n     of two zinc and copper discs           odometer being held over against\r\n     moistened with salt and water, the     the surface of the copper disc;\r\n     odometer being held opposite to the    for again, if it be held to the\r\n     middle of the zinc disc; for if it     edge of the copper disc, the\r\n     be held beyond the disc, half an       opposite result follows, and the\r\n     inch from and on the exact level       rotation is clock-rotation.\r\n     of the zinc disc, versed-rotation\r\n     is manifested round the whole\r\n     circumference.\r\n\r\n  _c._ A mixture of half a drachm of        A mixture of half a drachm of\r\n     bicarbonate of soda and five grains    tartaric of bicarbonate\r\n     acid and five grain of tartaric acid,  of soda.\r\n     when effervescing upon a plate after\r\n     the addition of water.\r\n\r\n  _d._ The northward pole of a horse-shoe   The southward pole of the same.\r\n     magnet, or of a magnetic\r\n     needle freely suspended.\r\n\r\n  _e._ One pole of a large crystal, which,  The opposite pole.\r\n     is to be found out by this\r\n     experiment.\r\n\r\n  _f._ The root of a garden weed freshly    The leaves of the same.\r\n     taken from the ground.\r\n\r\n  _g._ The stalk end of an orange, and      The opposite points of the same.\r\n     of an apple, and of an orange pip.\r\n\r\n  _h._ The small end of an egg.             The large end of the same.\r\n\r\n  _i._ The tips of the fingers on either    The top of the thumb and great\r\n     hand, and of the toes of either        toe.\r\n     foot.\r\n\r\n  _k._ Right side of the head of a          Left side.\r\n     sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe last holds likewise with the greater part of the human body;\r\nbut the results of trying the odometer with the human frame are so\r\ncomplicated, that I shall reserve their consideration for a separate\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The mechanical solution of these phenomena is simple enough. The\r\nodometer must be under the influence of two constant and unequal\r\nrectilinear forces, operating at right angles to each other on the gold\r\nring, the effects of which are modified by the centripetal force of its\r\ngravitation. All that is required is, to determine by observation the\r\nplace, direction, and limits of the two forces.\r\n\r\nIt will render the description which follows easier, to suppose that\r\nthe pole of the Od-subject which causes clock-rotation be turned\r\ndirectly from the experimenter; for example, that an egg be placed\r\nlongways to the experimenter with its small end from him, or a bar\r\nmagnet with its northward pole from him. In the case of a horse-shoe\r\nmagnet, both poles are then turned from you. So, too, in the case of\r\nthe hand, the fingers and thumbs are both to be turned away.\r\n\r\n _a._ Odometer held immediately before, and a quarter of an inch from,\r\n the small end of an egg. _Result_—Distad motion, or motion in the\r\n direction of the long axis of the egg, from the egg.\r\n\r\n _b._ Odometer similarly held to the great end. _Result_—Proximad\r\n motion of the odometer—that is, again, motion directly from the axis\r\n of the egg.\r\n\r\n _c._ Hold the odometer near either side of the egg, one-fifth of the\r\n distance from either end. _Results_—Transverse sinistrad oscillations.\r\n The same current may be detected above the egg on the same parallels.\r\n\r\nThe effects described are given in fig. 17. Then here are, at either\r\nend of the egg, two rectilinear currents acting at right angles to each\r\nother. Fig. 18 represents the complementary motions to the above,\r\nwhich are obtained by touching the odometer finger with the thumb. A\r\nparallel combination of rectilinear motions is produced, but in another\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe next three figures exemplify the composition of forces necessary to\r\nproduce the rotatory motion of the odometer.\r\n\r\nFigs. 19 and 20 are intended to represent the large ends of two eggs,\r\nso placed that the axial currents of the two shall cross at right\r\nangles, at a point equidistant, let us say at half an inch exactly,\r\nfrom the end of each egg. If the ring be suspended exactly at the point\r\nof meeting of the two forces, it will be driven off in the diagonal,\r\nand continue simply to oscillate in the line A B. But if either of the\r\neggs is moved back to double its former distance from the point of\r\nintersection of the two forces, the forces will be rendered unequal,\r\nand new results will ensue. The two experiments by which the results\r\nof this arrangement may be tried are represented in figs. 21, 22, and\r\nfigs. 23, 24. The longer current is necessarily thereby the weaker of\r\nthe two in each combination. Accordingly, rotatory motion supervenes\r\nin each case instead of diagonal oscillation; and the direction of the\r\nrotation is from the stronger towards the weaker current.\r\n\r\nFigure 25 represents the various motions which may be elicited by\r\nholding the odometer at the sides or over different parts of a\r\nhorse-shoe magnet. The continued lines in all the diagrams represent\r\nthe primary motions, the dotted lines their complementary motions.\r\n\r\nFigures 26 and 27 represent, in the same way, the primary and secondary\r\noscillations obtainable over the centre of, or parallel to the needle.\r\n\r\nFigures 28 and 29 represent the motions displayed by the odometer,\r\nwhen it is held above various points in the interval between two\r\nsovereigns, placed upon the table an inch and a half asunder. Compound\r\neffects follow, produced by the joint influence of the two bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVI. I will finally describe the phenomena elicited by the odometer\r\nfrom the living human frame, including those which are dependent on\r\ndifference of sex.\r\n\r\nParties to experiments with the odometer may be in the position either\r\nof Od-subjects, or of reversers of its effects in the hands of others,\r\nor they may be themselves components of the odometer.\r\n\r\nI can discover absolutely no difference in the results obtained by the\r\nodometer on men and women, when treated as Od-subjects. The following\r\nresults appear to me equally obtainable with persons of both sexes.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the arms below the elbows, the wrists and hands,\r\nand of the legs below the knees, the ankles and feet, the two sides\r\nof the person display the polar differences already noticed. If the\r\nodometer be held over the right side of the head, (either front or\r\nback,) over the right side of the face, over the right shoulder or\r\nelbow, or right knee, it exhibits clock-rotation. Held over the same\r\nparts on the left side, it exhibits versed-rotation. On touching the\r\nodometer-finger with the thumb, these effects are of course reversed.\r\n\r\nIf the odometer be held over the middle and outside of either arm, or\r\nover the middle and back of either fore-arm or hand, it oscillates\r\nlongitudinally and towards the hand or foot. On reapplying the\r\nthumb, these longitudinal oscillations are replaced by transverse\r\noscillations, having a direction _outwards_—_i. e._, away from the\r\nmesial plane of the frame.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena last described show that the primary idea of a\r\ntransverse polarity for the whole frame is still verifiable, even in\r\nthe extreme parts of either limb. But below the elbows and knees a\r\nsecond polarity is superinduced upon the former. Below the elbows and\r\nknees, one side of each limb repeats the phenomena of the right side of\r\nthe body, the other those of the left. The odometer held over the tips\r\nof the fingers of either hand exhibits clock-rotation, over the thumb\r\nof either hand versed-rotation; and with these, as I have mentioned,\r\nall the other effects that can be elicited out of the two limbs of\r\na horse-shoe magnet. The same rotatory movements may likewise be\r\nobtained by holding the odometer near the two edges of the hand, wrist,\r\nfore-arm. The latter singularity, which contrasts with the simpler\r\neffects on the upper arm, must result from the combination of the two\r\npolarities—the systemic and the submembral one.\r\n\r\nThe odometer, held over the back of the neck or throat, oscillates\r\ntransversely. When versed, longitudinally.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me now that women generally are incapable of eliciting\r\nthe movements of the odometer when held by themselves, without touching\r\na second party.\r\n\r\nI have already, in the introductory part of this letter, given a\r\nsummary of all the modes I am acquainted with of reversing the motions\r\nof the odometer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have presumed too much in heading this letter with the title\r\nof “The Solution.” But what is the solution of physical phenomena\r\nbut the displaying of the forces which compel their sequence? As an\r\ninquiry progresses, a few general expressions take the place of the\r\nfirst imperfect and complicated explanation. But the first step made\r\nwas still a solution; and the highest solution ever yet obtained has\r\nprobably still to be merged in some expression yet more general. So the\r\nattraction of gravitation is probably connected with, or balanced by,\r\na corresponding repulsive force, coming into operation at some enormous\r\ndistance from the centre of each planetary sphere, and the two may\r\neventually prove to form one law.\r\n\r\nBut I had hoped that I was not presuming in asserting that the present\r\ninquiry has immediate practical applications, such as seldom fall to\r\nthe lot of so young an investigation. The odometer may prove a useful\r\ntest of the presence and qualities of electric, chemical, and magnetic\r\nactions; it will probably help to determine the electrochemical\r\nqualities of bodies; and in large or small crystalline masses—in the\r\ndiamond, for instance—will serve to show the axes and distinguish the\r\nopposite poles. In reference to biology, it will probably furnish the\r\nlong-wanted criterion between death and apparent death; for I observe\r\nthat, with an egg long kept, but still alive, though no longer likely\r\nto be very palatable, the odometer freely moves in the way described in\r\nthe fourth section. But it treats the freshest egg, when boiled, as if\r\nit were a lump of zinc.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I am not without certain misgivings. I suspect that the\r\ndivining-ring will be found to manifest genuine Od-motions in the hands\r\nof as small a number as succeed with the divining-rod. And I fear that\r\noverhasty confidence in results only seemingly sound, may lead many\r\nastray into a wide field of self-deception.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nAn accident has given me the opportunity of making further additions to\r\nthis little volume, of which I proceed to avail myself; and, first, by\r\ncommunicating my latest experiments with the divining-ring, July 24.\r\n\r\nI. I have stated that, if a fresh egg be placed upon the table, with\r\nthe small end directed _from_ me—or a crystal, with one definite\r\npole so turned from me—or a bar-magnet, with its northward pole so\r\ndisposed—and I then suspend the divining-ring half an inch above either\r\nof the three so averted ends, and half an inch further off from me,\r\nthe ring exhibits clock-rotation in each instance. Held in a parallel\r\nmanner over the opposite ends—that is, half an inch from, and half an\r\ninch higher than, the same—the ring exhibits versed-rotation. If the\r\nthree Od-subjects be moved round, so that their hitherto distal ends\r\npoint to the right, or if they be further turned, so as to bring the\r\npreviously distal ends now to point directly _towards_ me, the ring\r\ncontinues to exhibit exactly the same motions as in the first instance.\r\n\r\nIf, these objects being removed, I lay a horse-shoe magnet on the table\r\nbefore me, with its poles turned directly _from_ me, the northward\r\nlimb being on my left hand, the southward limb-pole on my right, and\r\nexperiments parallel to those just described are made, the results\r\nremain the same. If, near one side of the horse-shoe magnet, I lay my\r\nleft hand on the table, the palm downwards, the thumb held wide of the\r\nfingers, the ring, if suspended half an inch from and above either of\r\nthe finger-points, displays clock-rotation; suspended similarly before\r\nand above the point of the thumb, versed-rotation. Or the fingers of\r\nthe left hand, so disposed, may be compared, in reference to Od, to the\r\nnorthward pole of a horse-shoe magnet, while the thumb corresponds with\r\nits southward pole.\r\n\r\nIf, removing my left hand, I turn the horse-shoe magnet, without\r\naltering the side on which it rests, half round, so that the poles\r\npoint directly _towards_ me, the northward pole being now, of course,\r\non my right, the southward pole on my left, the ring held as before\r\nover either of the two poles, displays the same results. If I now\r\nmove the magnet still nearer to me, so that its two poles are an inch\r\nbeyond the edge of the table, I can obtain results which furnish a more\r\nprecise explanation of the two rotatory movements already described,\r\nthan I had before arrived at.\r\n\r\nIf I now suspend the ring, with its lowest part on a level with the\r\nmagnet, and half an inch from its northward pole—that is, half an\r\ninch nearer me—it begins to oscillate longitudinally, with a bias\r\ntowards me, as if it were repelled from the pole of the magnet. If\r\nI then suspend the ring an inch vertically above the first point of\r\nsuspension, it begins to oscillate transversely, with a bias towards\r\nthe right, or as if impelled by a dextrad current. If I then lower the\r\nring half an inch, the first effect observed is, that it oscillates\r\nobliquely, being evidently impelled at once to the right and towards\r\nme—that is, in the diagonal of the two forces, of each of which I had\r\nbefore obtained the separate influence. In this third variation of the\r\nexperiments, I have brought the ring to the limit of the two currents,\r\nwhere both tell upon it. This oblique oscillation soon, however,\r\nundergoes a change: it changes into clock-rotation, showing that the\r\ntransverse or dextrad current is stronger than the longitudinal or\r\nproximad current.\r\n\r\nIf parallel experiments be made at levels below that of the pole of the\r\nmagnet, corresponding but opposite results ensue. If the whole series\r\nbe repeated upon the south pole of the magnet, opposite but perfectly\r\ncorresponding results are again obtained: and similar results may be\r\nobtained with the two poles of an egg.\r\n\r\nII. The mode in which I have latterly educed the rotatory movements\r\ndepending upon galvanism, has been this. I have laid two discs, one\r\nof zinc, the other of copper, one on the other, having previously\r\nmoistened their surfaces with salt and water. Then, as I mentioned,\r\nthe ring held over the middle of the zinc disc (that being uppermost)\r\nexhibits clock-rotation. Held over the middle of the copper disc, when\r\nthat is laid uppermost, versed-rotation. I mentioned, too, that if held\r\nbeyond, but near the circumference of the same discs, the direction of\r\nthe motion of the ring is reversed.\r\n\r\nThe discs which I employ are circular, an inch and a half in diameter,\r\nand about as thick as a sovereign. Upon these I do not fail to obtain,\r\nwhen dried and used singly, the first series of phenomena described in\r\nthe preceding letter. But it occurred to me to try what would be the\r\nresult of suspending the ring over the two together, and alternately\r\nlaid uppermost, when they had been well cleaned and dried. This is\r\nevidently a still simpler voltaic arrangement than when the salt and\r\nwater is additionally used. The result was in the highest degree\r\ninteresting. When I suspend the ring half an inch above the centre\r\nof the copper disc, (that being laid uppermost,) the first motion\r\nobserved is transverse; but after a few oscillations it becomes\r\noblique—dextrad and proximad combined, in the diagonal between the\r\nprimary influences of the zinc and of the copper. This change does not\r\nlast long; the transverse force again carries it, in this instance, and\r\nclock-rotation is permanently established. When the zinc is uppermost,\r\nthe corresponding opposite phenomena manifest themselves; and in either\r\ncase a reversed movement occurs, if the ring is held extra-marginally\r\nto the discs.\r\n\r\nIII. I may say that I have now obtained positive evidence that these\r\nmotions of the odometer do not depend upon my own will, or the sympathy\r\nof my will with existing conceptions in my mind; for they succeed\r\nnearly equally well when the discs are covered with half a sheet of\r\nwriting-paper. In nine cases out of ten, when I thus manage to be\r\nin perfect ignorance which disc, or what combination of the two, is\r\nsubmitted to the odometer, the right results manifest themselves, and\r\nthe cause of the occasional failures is generally obvious. Let me add\r\nupon this topic, that one day, the weather being cold and wet, and\r\nmyself suffering severely with rheumatism, the odometer would not move\r\nat all in my hand. On another day, late in the evening it was, when I\r\nhappened to be much fatigued and exhausted, the ring moved, indeed,\r\nbut every motion was exactly reversed; thus my left hand I found now\r\nobtained exactly the results which, on other occasions, I got with the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIV. But by what cause, then—through what mechanism, so to speak, are\r\nthe movements of the odometer immediately produced? Early in the\r\ninquiry I made this experiment. Instead of winding the free end of the\r\nsilk round my finger, I wound it round a cedar-pencil, and laid the\r\nlatter upon the backs of two books, which were made to stand on their\r\nedges, four inches apart, with the Od-subject on the table between\r\nthem, the ring being suspended half an inch above it. The ring, of\r\ncourse, remained stationary. Then I took hold of the pencil with my\r\nfinger and thumb, at the point where the silk was wound round it; my\r\nfinger and thumb rested on the silk; but no motion of the odometer\r\nensued. Hence it follows, that the odometer is, after all, always set\r\nin motion _by the play of my own muscles_. I venture then to suppose\r\nthat my sentient nerves, unknown to me, detect on these occasions\r\ncertain relations of matter—let me call them currents of force—which\r\ndetermine in me _reflexly_ certain sympathetic motions of the very\r\nlightest, and even of an unconscious character. This idea, which I am\r\nsure affords the just solution of the matter, is highly consistent\r\nwith some observations which I have before recounted. It explains how\r\nthe primary delicate impression should yield to the coarser influence\r\nof a strong conception in the mind, that this or that other motion\r\nof the ring is about to follow, or even to that of a vivid and, so\r\nto say, abstract conception of another motion. It explains what I\r\nhave several times verified, that on certain days a person standing\r\nbehind me with his hand on my ear, or on my shoulder, can, by an\r\neffort of his will (mine not resisting,) make the odometer which I am\r\nholding move whichever way he happens strongly to image to himself,\r\nwithout communicating the same to me. It explains to me on what the\r\ndifference consists between those who can set the divining-ring in\r\nmotion, without a conscious effort, and those who cannot. The former,\r\nit will be found, are persons of so great nervous mobility, that any\r\nsuch motions, if their occurrence be forcibly anticipated by them, will\r\ncertainly be realized by their sympathetic frames. Among this class\r\nshould be sought, and would still remain to be detected by experiment,\r\nthose whose _impressionability by Od should prove commensurate with\r\ntheir nervous mobility_. Finally, I cannot doubt that the view which\r\nI have thus arrived at respecting the mechanism of the motions of the\r\nodometer, is equally applicable to the explanation of those of the\r\ndivining-rod. I see that, through its means, many before anomalous\r\nfacts, with the narrative of which I have not bored the reader, which\r\nemerged in my former trials of the divining rod, made by the hands of\r\nothers, lose their obscurity and contradictoriness, and leave the whole\r\nsubject in the condition of an intelligible and luminous conception.\r\n\r\nN. B.—It is a pity that of the inquirers who now amuse themselves with\r\ninvestigating these subjects, very few realize in their minds the idea\r\nof Von Reichenbach, that Od, though often exhibiting the same relations\r\nwith electricity and magnetism, is yet an utterly different principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.\r\n\r\n HYPNOTISM. TRANCE-UMBRA.—Mr. Braid’s discovery—Trance-faculties\r\n manifested in the waking state—Self-induced waking\r\n clairvoyance—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an advantage attending a long and patient analysis of, and\r\ncautious theorizing upon, a new subject of inquiry, that when fresh\r\nfacts and principles emerge in it, instead of disturbing such solid\r\nwork as I have supposed, they but enrich and strengthen it, and find,\r\nas it were, prepared for them appropriate niches. Something of this\r\nsatisfaction I experience, when I have to render tardy justice to Mr.\r\nBraid’s discovery, and to give an account of the wonders realized by\r\nDr. Darling, Mr. Lewis, and others.\r\n\r\nOr, I have observed, that trance, considered in reference to its\r\nproduction, has a twofold character. It presents itself either as a\r\nspontaneous seizure brought on unexpectedly by a continuance of mental\r\nor physical excitement or exhaustion; or as intentionally induced\r\nthrough the systematic direction by some second person, more or less\r\ncognisant what definite effects he can produce, of certain moral and\r\nphysical influences upon the party intended to be wrought on. Mr.\r\nBraid has added a third causal difference to the theory of trance.\r\nHe has shown that trance can be induced by the subject of it himself\r\nvoluntarily, by the use of certain means, which call into operation\r\na special principle. The effects which he obtained by these means,\r\nbut which he perhaps studied too much to separate from the effects of\r\nmesmerism—these and their principle he denominated _Hypnotism_.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have shown that all the forms of trance may be, and require to\r\nbe, arranged under five types—viz., death-trance, trance-coma, initial\r\ntrance, half-waking trance, full-waking trance. I mentioned, besides,\r\nthat in the manifestation of Zschokke’s seer-gift, and in the accounts\r\nwhich we receive of the performances called second-sight, the extended\r\nexoneural perception was introduced by a brief period, in which the\r\nperformer was _in a degree_ absorbed and lost, yet did not pass on\r\ninto a second and separate phase of consciousness. He was still always\r\nhimself, and observed and remembered as parts of his natural order of\r\nrecollections the impressions which then occurred to him. This same\r\nstate must be that which I have seen described as one peculiarly suited\r\nto the exhibition of phreno-mesmerism. Mr. Braid appears likewise often\r\nto have brought it on in his curative applications of hypnotism. But\r\nnow it has new importance and distinctness conferred upon it, as being\r\nthe state in which the wonderful phenomena of “mental suggestion” are\r\nbest displayed, and in which conscious clairvoyance is manifested.\r\nAs this state does not amount to complete trance, but as it is a\r\nfore-shadowing of it, as it were, I venture to propose for it the name\r\nof trance-umbra.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Hypnotism_.—Mr. Braid discovered that if certain sensitive persons\r\nfix their sight steadily upon a small bright object, held near and\r\nabove the forehead, or their sight becoming fatigued, and the eyelids\r\nfall, if they keep their attention strained as if they were still\r\nobserving the same object, both in the upward direction of the eye and\r\nin their thought, they lose themselves and go off into a state which,\r\nin its full development, is, in fact, initial trance, bordering often\r\non trance-coma. The party thus fixed sometimes exhibited many of the\r\nhumbler performances of ordinarily mesmerised persons. But Mr. Braid\r\nshall speak for himself; I quote from his _Neurhypnology_, published in\r\nLondon in 1843. “I requested,” narrates Mr. Braid, “a young gentleman\r\npresent to sit down, and maintain a fixed stare at the top of a\r\nwine-bottle, placed so much above him as to produce a considerable\r\nstrain on the eyes and eyelids, to enable him to maintain a steady view\r\nof the object. In three minutes his eyelids closed, a gush of tears ran\r\ndown his cheeks, his head drooped, his face was slightly convulsed, he\r\ngave a groan, and instantly fell into profound sleep—the respiration\r\nbecoming slow, deep, and sibilant, the right hand and arm being\r\nagitated by slight convulsive movements,” (p. 17.) Again, (p. 18,) “I\r\ncalled up,” continues Mr. Braid, “one of my men-servants, who knew\r\nnothing of mesmerism, and gave him such directions as were calculated\r\nto impress his mind with the idea, that his fixed attention was merely\r\nfor the purpose of watching a chemical experiment in the preparation\r\nof some medicine; and being familiar with such he could feel no alarm.\r\nIn two minutes and a half his eyelids closed slowly with a vibrating\r\nmotion, his chin fell on his breast, he gave a deep sigh, and instantly\r\nwas in a deep sleep, breathing loudly. In about one minute after his\r\nprofound sleep, I roused him, and pretended to chide him for being so\r\ncareless, said he ought to be ashamed of himself for not being able to\r\nattend to my instructions for three minutes without falling asleep, and\r\nordered him down stairs. In a short time I recalled this young man and\r\ndesired him to sit down once more, but to be careful not to fall asleep\r\nagain, as on the former occasion. He sat down with this intention; but\r\nat the expiration of two minutes and a half, his eyelids closed, and\r\nexactly the same phenomena as in the former experiment ensued.” Mr.\r\nBraid adds, “I again tried the experiment of causing the first person\r\nspoken of to gaze on a different object to that used in the first\r\nexperiment, but still, as I anticipated, the phenomena were the same. I\r\nalso tried on him M. Lafontaine’s mode of mesmerising with the thumbs\r\nand eyes, and likewise by gazing on my eyes without contact; and still\r\nthe effects were the same.”\r\n\r\nIt is indeed perfectly obvious that Mr. Braid succeeded in producing\r\na heavy form of initial trance in these cases. Nor is it easy to get\r\nrid of the impression that the effect was not partly at least owing\r\nto his personal Od-influence. But, remembering what I witnessed of\r\nhis performances, and construing candidly all his statements, I am\r\ndisposed to believe that his method, adopted by the patient when in a\r\nroom alone, upon himself, would throw susceptible persons into trance.\r\nMr. Braid appears to me to have the double merit, first of having\r\ndiscovered the means of self-mesmerising—of so disturbing by very\r\nsimple and harmless means the nervous system, that trance would appear\r\nwithout the influence of a second party to aid its supervention—and\r\nsecondly, of having, at an early period, when prejudice ran very high\r\nin England against these practices, availed himself of this disguised\r\nmesmerism to do much good in the treatment of disease. Mr. Braid does\r\nnot appear to have fallen on any instances of clairvoyance, but he\r\nnarrates many observations relating to phreno-mesmerism.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Trance-Umbra._—This is the best title I can hit on to designate\r\nthe peculiar condition, the study of which promises to exceed in\r\ninterest that of any of the phases of perfect trance; inasmuch as in\r\nthis state the same extraordinary powers are manifested as in trance,\r\nwithout the condition of an abstracted state of consciousness, which\r\nrendered the possession of those powers useless, at least, directly,\r\nto the person who manifested them. It is true that this law could\r\nbe broken; the mesmeriser can desire an entranced clairvoyante to\r\nremember, when she awakes, any particular event or communication\r\nmade by her. But for this exceptional power a special injunction or\r\npermit is necessary. In trance-umbra, on the contrary, the subject\r\nis throughout _himself_. When exhibiting the wildest phenomena he is\r\nconscious of what he is doing, and preserves afterwards as accurate a\r\nrecollection of it as any of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThen, how is trance-umbra induced? How is it known that the shadow of\r\ntrance has enveloped the patient, and that, though quite himself to all\r\nappearance, he is in a state to manifest the highest trance-faculties?\r\n\r\nThe way to induce trance-umbra, is to administer a little dose of\r\nmesmerism. One operator, like Dr. Darling, (I quote from Dr. Gregory’s\r\nmost instructive and interesting _Letters on Animal Magnetism_,)\r\ndirects his patient to sit still with his eyes fixed, and his attention\r\nconcentrated on a coin held in his hand, or on a double-convex bit\r\nof zinc with a central portion of copper so held. This is, in truth,\r\na gentle dose of hypnotism. The patient looks in quiet repose at a\r\nsmall object held in his hand or his lap, instead of fatiguing his\r\nsensations by straining the eye-balls upwards. Suppose a group of a\r\ndozen persons sitting thus in a half-darkened, still room, preserving\r\na studied quietude, and concentrating their attention on one point\r\nof easy vision; in from fifteen to twenty minutes one or more is\r\nfound to be in the state of trance-umbra. Mr. Lewis (I quote again\r\nthe same authority) employs a different process. He eyes his patients\r\nintently as they sit in a row before him, still and composed, with a\r\nconcentrated will, and its full outward expression by him, to influence\r\ntheir psychical condition. In five minutes it often happens that the\r\nstate of trance-umbra supervenes.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, what has marked its arrival? The Rev. R. S. F. writes\r\nme, that he had been three times the subject of the first of the\r\ntwo methods: the operator was Mr. Stone, Lecturer at the Marylebone\r\nScientific Institution. The first two experiments were successful,\r\nthe third failed. Then Mr. F. writes, “The only circumstance which\r\nI noticed (bearing upon the above question) in myself, and which I\r\nafterwards found tallied with the experience of others, was this: On\r\nthe two occasions when I was affected, after about ten minutes the coin\r\nbegan to disappear from my sight, and to reappear a confused, brilliant\r\nsubstance, similar to those appearances which remain on the retina\r\nafter one has been looking towards the sun for a few minutes, and I\r\nseemed for the moment to have fallen into a half-dreamy state; but in\r\nthe subsequent part of the experiments, I appeared to myself to be in\r\nmy ordinary state. On the third occasion, when the experiment failed\r\nwith myself and with all the others, (which I think might be accounted\r\nfor by the accidental irregularity of the proceedings,) I did not\r\nexperience the sensations mentioned above.” This account tallies with\r\nother evidence upon the point; a brief period of disturbed sensation,\r\nor threatening confusion, or loss of consciousness, passes over the\r\npatient. The wing of the unseen power, to speak figuratively, has\r\ncast its shadow upon him. It is evident that this transient psychical\r\ndisturbance is the same phenomenon with that which Zschokke experienced\r\nwhenever his seer-gift was manifested. The agency which thus can at\r\npleasure be used to call forth trance-umbra, is the same which employed\r\nlonger, or more intensely, produces perfect trance. The little dose\r\nthrilling through the system, without driving sense and apprehension\r\nfrom their usual seats, seems, as it were, to remove their fastenings;\r\nto throw up, as it were, the sashes of the body, so that the soul can\r\nnow look forth and see, not as through a glass, darkly, but free to\r\ngrasp directly things out of its corporeal tenement, whether of the\r\nnature of matter or mind.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, this same loosening of physical bonds renders\r\nthe mind correspondingly denuded to aggressions from without. We have\r\nseen how strangely the entranced mind becomes sympathetically subject\r\nto the will, and the subject of the sensations of the person with whom\r\nit has been brought into mesmeric relation. But now a new feature, or\r\none feebly manifested as yet in trance, but parallel to the influence\r\nof sympathy, displays itself. The person in trance-umbra is an absolute\r\nslave to the spoken, or even to the unexpressed “mental suggestions”\r\nof the operator. Sense, memory, judgment, give way at his word. The\r\npatient believes whatever he is told to believe,—that an apple is an\r\norange,—that he himself is the Duke of Wellington,—that the operator\r\nstanding before him is invisible to him,—and makes fruitless efforts to\r\nexecute any voluntary movement the moment he is told he cannot. I will\r\nquote a passage, in illustration of the above, again from Mr. F.’s\r\nletter:—“After a quarter of an hour Mr. Stone came to us, and looked\r\nin our eyes for a few seconds, and desired us to close them. He then\r\nplaced his thumb lightly on my forehead, and said, peremptorily, ‘You\r\ncannot open your eyes.’ I had great difficulty in doing so, but at\r\nlast succeeded, with a violent struggle. After Mr. Stone had repeated\r\nthe order or suggestion once or twice more, I was quite unable to open\r\nmy eyes. Five out of the number, (about a dozen,) who sat down were\r\naffected, all more than myself. On a succeeding evening, however, Mr.\r\nStone was able to proceed so far as to make me forget my name and\r\naddress, by the simple assertion, ‘You cannot remember your name,’\r\n&c., though he had before this just asked for them, and the answer was\r\nscarcely out of my mouth when he made me forget it. I think I never\r\nexerted my will more strongly than in trying to open my eyelids when\r\nthey had been thus closed; but it appeared simply impossible to do this\r\ntill the operator’s magic ‘All right,’ immediately set them free. On\r\nseveral, who were highly susceptible, Mr. Stone proceeded with other\r\nexperiments. A stick was said to be a rattlesnake, and believed to be\r\nso. The room became a garden at his command, with wild beasts in it.\r\nOne was set a-fishing and snow-balling; another taken up in a balloon.\r\nA still more curious instance was when the subject was told that he\r\nwas in the dark, and a candle was passed before his eyes, almost close\r\nenough to singe the eyebrows, without producing any visual impression\r\non the eye, though the party operated on said he felt the warmth of it.”\r\n\r\nI have preferred giving additional and unpublished evidence of the\r\nwonderful control which can thus be “suggestively” exercised over the\r\nbelief of a person in trance-umbra, to quoting Professor Gregory’s\r\nmost interesting cases, for which the reader must consult his recent\r\nvaluable work. In the sixth letter in the present volume, (that on\r\nSomnambulism,) I have exemplified the manifestation of the same\r\nphenomena in the case of the sleep-walker Negretti. As a large number\r\nof persons can be thrown easily into the state of trance-umbra; and\r\nas then they are totally in the power of the operator, it is surely\r\nmost desirable that this and the parallel easily induced conditions\r\nof the frame should be made subjects of careful observation and study\r\nby many competent persons, in order that the conditions necessary to\r\ntheir induction may be exactly ascertained, and made public, for the\r\nprotection of society.\r\n\r\nOf equal interest is the discovery that clairvoyance may be manifested\r\nin the state of trance-umbra. Major Buckley is spoken of by Professor\r\nGregory as a gentleman possessing mesmerising force of a remarkable\r\nquality and degree. It appears that he had been long in the habit of\r\nproducing magnetic sleep, and clairvoyance in the sleep, before he\r\ndiscovered that, in his subjects, the sleep might be dispensed with.\r\nDr. Gregory gives the following account of his present method:—\r\n\r\n“Major B. first ascertains whether his subjects are susceptible, by\r\nmaking, with his hand, passes above and below their hands, from the\r\nwrist downwards. If certain sensations, such as tingling, numbness,\r\n&c., are strongly felt, he knows that he will be able to produce the\r\nmagnetic sleep. But to ascertain whether he can obtain conscious\r\nclairvoyance, he makes slow passes from his own forehead to his own\r\nchest. If this produce a blue light in his face, strongly visible, the\r\nsubject will probably acquire conscious clairvoyance. If not, or if\r\nthe light be pale, the subject will only become clairvoyant in the\r\nsleep, (that is, when in perfect trance.) Taking those subjects who see\r\na very deep blue light, he continues to make passes over his own face,\r\nand also over the object—a box or a nut, for instance—in which written\r\nor printed words are enclosed, which the clairvoyante is to read. Some\r\nsubjects only require a pass or two to be made: others require many.\r\nThey describe the blue light as rendering the box or nut transparent,\r\nso that they can read what is inside. This reminds us of the curious\r\nfact mentioned by Von Reichenbach, that bars of iron or steel, seen\r\nby conscious sensitives, without any passes, shining in the dark with\r\nthe Od glow, appeared to them transparent like glass. If too many\r\npasses are made by Major B., the blue light becomes so deep that they\r\ncannot read, and some reverse passes must be made to render the colour\r\nof the light less deep. Major Buckley has thus produced conscious\r\nclairvoyance in eighty-nine persons, forty-four of whom have been able\r\nto read mottoes contained in nutshells purchased by other parties for\r\nthe experiments. The longest motto thus read contained ninety-eight\r\nwords.” “A lady, one of Major Buckley’s waking clairvoyantes, read\r\none hundred and three mottoes contained in nuts in one day, without a\r\npass being made on that occasion. In this and in many other cases, the\r\npower of reading through nuts, boxes, and envelopes, remained, when\r\nonce induced, for about a month, and then disappeared. The same lady,\r\nafter three months, could no longer read without passes; and it took\r\nfive trials fully to restore the power. This may be done, however,\r\nimmediately by inducing the mesmeric sleep and clairvoyance in that\r\nstate, when the subjects, in the hands of Major Buckley, soon acquire\r\nthe power of waking clairvoyance.”\r\n\r\nBut stranger things remain behind—corollaries, however, of the\r\npreceding, yet which eclipse these wonders, if possible. For a\r\nknowledge of these, I am exclusively indebted to Professor Gregory’s\r\nrecent publication, and I give them on his authority.\r\n\r\nIf the looking intently upon a piece of metal will produce trance and\r\ntrance-umbra, why should not the account of the Egyptian boy-seers be\r\ncorrect? If their performance be often a trick, may not the protracted\r\ngaze on the black spot in their hand sometimes render them waking\r\nclairvoyantes? and why, on the same showing, might not the gazing upon\r\nmagic crystals or mirrors of jet occasionally have thrown the already\r\nawe-struck and fitly disposed lookers on them into the state in which\r\neither the magician at their side might compel _suggestively_ images\r\ninto their fancy, or they, acting for themselves, have exercised\r\nindependent ultravision, retrovision, prevision? Why, again, should not\r\nsimple concentration of thought upon one uninteresting idea convert a\r\nsusceptible subject into a soothsayer? Then read the following facts\r\nrecorded by Dr. Gregory; I at least do not question their fidelity.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lewis possesses at times the power of spontaneous clairvoyance, by\r\nsimple concentration of thought. He finds, however, that gazing into a\r\ncrystal substance produces the state of waking clairvoyance in him much\r\nsooner and more easily. On one occasion, being in a house in Edinburgh\r\nwith a party, he looked into a crystal, and saw in it the inhabitants\r\nof another house at a considerable distance. Along with them he saw two\r\nstrangers, entire strangers to him. These he described to the company.\r\nHe then proceeded to the other house, and there found the two strangers\r\nwhom he had described.”\r\n\r\n“On another occasion he was asked to inspect a house and family, quite\r\nunknown to him, in Sloane Street, Chelsea, he being in Edinburgh with\r\na party. He saw in the crystal the family in London; described the\r\nhouse, and also an old gentleman very ill or dying, and wearing a\r\npeculiar cap. All was found to be correct, and the cap was one which\r\nhad lately been sent to the old gentleman. On the same occasion Mr.\r\nLewis told a gentleman present that he had lost or mislaid a key of a\r\nvery particular shape, which he, Mr. L., saw in the crystal. This was\r\nconfirmed by the gentleman, a total stranger to Mr. Lewis.”\r\n\r\n  “Sistimus hic tandem.”\r\n\r\nI think that I have tolerably succeeded in establishing the thesis\r\nwith which these Letters started, that every superstition is based\r\non a truth; and I am in hopes that the mass of evidence which I have\r\nadduced—the very variety of the phenomena described, joined to their\r\nmutual coherence—the theoretical consistency of the whole, as if it\r\nwere truly a vast body of living science, and not the “disjecta membra”\r\nof a dream—will remove every remaining shade of doubt among candid\r\nreaders, that these inquiries are not less sound than they are curious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance with the facts which it has been the object of the\r\nforegoing pages to assemble, and to render into philosophy, suggests\r\none or two serious reflections.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the different results which have ensued when these\r\nfacts have emerged into day in times of ignorance and in times\r\nof enlightenment. On the first occasion they were viewed with\r\nterror—became instruments of superstition—were used for bad designs—and\r\neven originated new forms of crime, before which common sense fled,\r\nand justice became blind and iniquitous. On the latter—I speak of the\r\nreception of these facts towards and in the present century—they were\r\nrecognised by one after another of the most sagacious observers of\r\nnature; by Jussieu, for instance, and by Cuvier, to begin with; and\r\ngradually by an increasing host of candid, well-informed, and able\r\nfollowers, as forming a part of natural science, and as susceptible of\r\nimportant applications.\r\n\r\nHe is ranked among the wisest of mankind, who announced that “knowledge\r\nis power.” Divine Wisdom goes further, and reveals to us that knowledge\r\nis a good and virtuous thing, while ignorance is stamped by the same\r\nseal as sinful; or how otherwise can we interpret the course of history\r\nand human experience, which proves that, by the very constitution of\r\nour being, and the laws impressed upon the moral and physical world,\r\nincrease of knowledge contributes to promote general and individual\r\nwell-doing and happiness, while ignorance never fails to be followed by\r\nthe contrary penal consequences? Therefore it is that those who unite\r\ngood intentions and good principles, with sound and well-cultivated\r\nabilities—in other words the truly wise—humbly deem, that among the\r\nmost acceptable offerings to our common Maker must be diligence in\r\nexploring _all_ the sources of knowledge which he has placed within our\r\nreach, (which were hidden only that we might seek for them,) so as to\r\nunveil more and more of the forces and powers of nature, in publishing\r\nthe same abroad, that all may profit by them, and in striving to bend\r\ntheir agencies towards good, and high, and useful purposes.\r\n\r\n  THE END.",
