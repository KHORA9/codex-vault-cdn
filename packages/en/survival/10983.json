The crew, you see, have\r\nmade a raft of some of the spars and planks of the ship, and having all\r\ngot upon it, are about cutting loose from the wreck, with the hope that\r\nthey may reach one of the distant islands.\r\n\r\nPoor men! they did indeed reach the island; but only to meet a more\r\ndreadful death than that threatened them by the waves. Overcome with\r\nfatigue and anxiety, they no sooner gained the shore, than they all,\r\ncaptain, crew, and passengers, threw themselves on the earth, and soon\r\nwere fast asleep. In this helpless state, they were attacked by the\r\ncruel and blood-thirsty savages who inhabited the island, and all\r\nbarbarously murdered, except two little boys, John and William Doyley.\r\n\r\nThese children, sons of a gentleman and lady who had been passengers\r\nin the ill-fated ship, were kept in captivity by the savages for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the shipwreck, John was a stout lad, thirteen or fourteen\r\nyears old; but little William was a mere infant, being scarcely two\r\nyears of age! Think what a dreadful life these poor little orphans had\r\nbefore them! Their kind parents cruelly murdered, and themselves\r\nprisoners to the barbarous murderers!\r\n\r\nAt first the savages treated them harshly, and made them endure all\r\nkinds of privation and hardship. Finally, after changing from one cruel\r\nmaster to another several times, they were purchased by one more humane\r\nthan the rest, named Dupper, who took them to his home on a distant\r\nisland, and treated them with a great deal of kindness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDupper taught John how to shoot with the bow and arrow, with which he\r\nwas himself very expert. He also showed him their method of spearing\r\nfish, and taught him many other savage accomplishments. In Dupper's\r\nfamily, too, the boys both learned to speak the native language, and\r\nthey soon almost forgot their own.\r\n\r\nBut they did not forget their own country; at least John did not; and as\r\nhe often talked with William about their dear parents, and the pleasant\r\nhome they had left many miles away, there was but little danger of\r\nWilliam forgetting it either.\r\n\r\nThough kindly treated by Dupper and his family, and made as comfortable\r\nas their savage mode of life would allow, yet they suffered many cruel\r\nhardships, and severely felt the change from their former to their\r\npresent way of living. They constantly sighed for home, and were made\r\nquite wretched by the prospect of a captivity to which they could see\r\nno end, except in death.\r\n\r\nBut the same kind Providence who had preserved them when their parents\r\nand the crew of the unfortunate ship were murdered, still watched over\r\nand protected these despairing orphans. The day of their deliverance\r\ncame quite unexpectedly. An English vessel arrived at the island, and\r\ncast her anchor near the shore. The natives immediately manned their\r\ncanoes, and flocked on board, to trade with the strangers. John was\r\npermitted to go with the others, and when on the deck of the vessel,\r\nhe told the captain and officers all about the shipwreck, the murder\r\nof the crew and passengers, and his own and his brother's captivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe kind captain listened to his story, and then set at once about\r\neffecting the release of the two boys, which he easily accomplished,\r\nand William soon joined John on board of the vessel, where Dupper also\r\nappeared, to take leave of his young friends. The kind native was quite\r\nsad at the parting, and shed tears of regret as he bade them farewell.\r\nBut the boys were too happy in the expectation of seeing home once more,\r\nto grieve at parting with him, although he had been more kind to them\r\nthan any of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe next morning early, the ship set sail, and after visiting various\r\nplaces, she finally reached England in safety, where our two orphans\r\nwere restored to their surviving friends, by whom they were kindly taken\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\nLet us hope these little boys were ever grateful to their Heavenly\r\nFather, who had watched over and preserved them amid all their trials\r\nand sufferings, and finally enabled them to reach their home and\r\nfriends. And let us all remember, that we can trust in Him, for He is\r\nable to preserve us, as well in the hour of danger as in that of fancied\r\nsecurity and safety. Our lives are in His hands at all times, and it is\r\nfrom His mercy and goodness that we are fed, and clothed, and enjoy the\r\nmany blessings which He constantly bestows upon us.",
