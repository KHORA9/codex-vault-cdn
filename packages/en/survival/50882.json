HEINRICH ROBERT GOEPPERT, M.D.,\r\n\r\n  DIRECTOR OF THE BOTANIC GARDEN, BRESLAU;\r\n\r\n  ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PALÆONTOLOGICAL\r\n  BOTANISTS OF EUROPE,\r\n\r\n  The following Treatise\r\n\r\n  IS DEDICATED, WITH BEST RESPECTS, BY HIS\r\n  OBLIGED FRIEND\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of Fossil Botany or Palæophytology has formed a part of\r\nthe Course of Botany in the University of Edinburgh for the last\r\ntwenty-five years, and the amount of time devoted to the exposition\r\nof it has increased. The recent foundation of a Chair of Geology and\r\nof a Falconer Palæontological Fellowship in the University seems to\r\nrequire from the Professors of Zoology and Botany special attention\r\nto the bearings of their departments of science on the structure\r\nof the animals and plants of former epochs of the Earth's history.\r\nNo one can be competent to give a correct decision in regard to\r\nFossils, unless he has studied thoroughly the present Fauna and Flora\r\nof the globe. To give a well-founded opinion in regard to extinct\r\nbeings, it is essential that the observer should be conversant with\r\nthe conformation and development of the living ones now on the\r\nearth; with their habits, modes of existence and reproduction, the\r\nmicroscopic structure of their tissues, their distribution, and their\r\nrelation to soil, the atmosphere, temperature, and climate.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that to become a good Fossil Geologist a\r\nstudent must begin with living animals and plants. The study of\r\nGeology must be shared by the Petralogist, who looks at the\r\ncondition of the rocks of the globe, the minerals forming them, and\r\ntheir mode of formation; the Chemist, who determines the materials\r\nwhich enter into the composition of minerals and rocks; the\r\nNaturalist, who examines the plants and animals found in the various\r\nstrata; and perhaps also the Natural Philosopher, who calculates from\r\nindependent sources the phases of the Earth's history. It may be said\r\nthus to combine all these students of Science in one brotherhood.\r\nMuch has been done by the efforts of such men as Hutton and Werner,\r\nwho were engaged chiefly in considering the mineral department of\r\nGeology; but it is clear that the Science could not have attained its\r\npresent position without the continued labours of those who have been\r\nexamining fossils in their relations to time and space. Had it not\r\nbeen for the researches of Palæontologists, Geology could not have\r\nmade its present advance.\r\n\r\nIn my Class Book of Botany I have given an introduction to\r\nPalæophytology, and it occurred to me that it might be useful to\r\nstudents to publish this in a separate form, with additions in\r\nboth the letterpress and the illustrations. The institution of\r\nthe Palæontological Fellowship, in memory of my former friend Dr.\r\nFalconer, has brought the subject specially under my notice. The\r\nFellowship has been promoted chiefly by my friend and former pupil\r\nDr. Charles Murchison, a gentleman fond of science and of his Alma\r\nMater, the University of Edinburgh, where he and Falconer studied and\r\ntook their degrees.\r\n\r\nThe first award of the Fellowship has been made to a distinguished\r\nstudent, who acquitted himself with the greatest credit during the\r\nthree days of examination on Geology, Zoology, and Botany. I trust\r\nthat the Fellowship will continue to stimulate our eminent students\r\nin future years.\r\n\r\nHaving been a student of Natural Science along with Dr. Falconer, I\r\nfeel a peculiar interest in doing what I can to promote the study\r\nof a subject to which he so successfully devoted his energies.\r\nIn my endeavour to do so I have been encouraged by my friend and\r\nformer pupil, Mr. William Carruthers, at the head of the Botanical\r\nDepartment of the British Museum, and a former student in Edinburgh\r\nunder the late Professor Fleming. He has done much to advance our\r\nknowledge of Fossil Botany, and to him I am indebted for two of the\r\nplates and some of the woodcuts which illustrate this publication.\r\nHe has given me most efficient assistance, and I have to return my\r\nbest thanks for his kind aid. I am also indebted to my colleague,\r\nProfessor Geikie, for his valued assistance.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Edinburgh is rich in Fossils of the\r\nCarboniferous epoch, and much yet remains to be done to illustrate\r\nits Palæontology. Such labourers as Geikie and Peach may be expected\r\nto give great assistance in the furtherance of our knowledge of\r\nScottish Geology, so as to form a school which shall revive the\r\nreputation enjoyed by Edinburgh in the days of Hutton and Jameson.\r\nIf I can be useful in encouraging students to take up the study of\r\nPalæontological Botany, and to prosecute it with vigour, I shall feel\r\nthat this introductory treatise has not been issued in vain. As one\r\nof the few surviving relations of Dr. James Hutton, I am glad to be\r\nable to show an interest in a science which may aid in elucidating\r\nthe \"Theory of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing this work I have taken for granted that the reader is\r\nacquainted with the Elements of Botany, and knows the general\r\nstructure of plants of the present day. I have not, therefore,\r\nhesitated to use the ordinary Botanical terms without explanation. I\r\nam satisfied that no one can study Fossil Botany properly unless he\r\nhas studied Modern Botany.\r\n\r\nThose readers who may find any difficulty as to technical terms I\r\nwould refer to my Botanist's Companion, where a full Glossary is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n  27 INVERLEITH ROW,\r\n  _May 1872_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                           1\r\n\r\n  DETERMINATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS                                 3\r\n\r\n  MODE OF PRESERVATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS                          8\r\n\r\n  EXAMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS                 12\r\n\r\n  FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS                                           20\r\n\r\n  NATURAL ORDERS TO WHICH FOSSIL PLANTS BELONG                  22\r\n\r\n  PERIODS OF VEGETATION AMONG FOSSIL PLANTS                     25\r\n\r\n  FOSSIL FLORA OF THE PRIMARY OR PALÆZOIC PERIOD                26\r\n\r\n  REIGN OF ACROGENS                                             26\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH                              36\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE PERMIAN EPOCH                                    71\r\n\r\n  FOSSIL FLORA OF THE SECONDARY OR MESOZOIC PERIOD              72\r\n\r\n  REIGN OF GYMNOSPERMS                                          72\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE TRIAS AND LIAS EPOCHS                            77\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE OOLITIC EPOCH                                    80\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE WEALDEN EPOCH                                    84\r\n\r\n  FOSSIL FLORA OF THE TERTIARY OR CAINOZOIC PERIOD (INCLUDING\r\n  THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH)                                         87\r\n\r\n  REIGN OF ANGIOSPERMS                                          87\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE CHALK                                            87\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE EOCENE EPOCH                                     90\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE MIOCENE EPOCH                                    92\r\n\r\n  FLORA OF THE PLIOCENE EPOCH                                   98\r\n\r\n  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS                                          101\r\n\r\n  RECAPITULATION                                               103\r\n\r\n  WORKS ON FOSSIL BOTANY                                       105\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION OF PLATES                                        111\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                        113\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF WOODCUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIG.

It is,\r\nas Brongniart remarks, the history of life and its metamorphoses.\r\nThe researches of geologists show clearly that the globe has\r\nundergone various alterations since that \"beginning\" when \"God\r\ncreated the heavens and the earth.\" These alterations are exhibited\r\nin the different stratified rocks which form the outer crust of the\r\nearth, and which were chiefly sedimentary deposits produced by the\r\nweathering of the exposed rocks. Remains of the plants and animals\r\nliving on the globe at the time of the formation of the different\r\nbeds are preserved in them. Elevations and depressions of the surface\r\nof the earth affected the organisms on its surface, and gave to\r\nsuccessive deposits new faunas and floras. Some of these epochs have\r\nbeen marked by great changes in the physical state of our planet,\r\nand they have been accompanied with equally great modifications\r\nin the nature of the living beings which inhabited it. The study\r\nof the fossil remains of animals is called Palæozoology (παλαιός,\r\nancient, and ζῷον, animal), while the consideration of those of\r\nvegetables is denominated Palæophytology (παλαιός and φυτόν, a plant).\r\nBoth are departments of the science of Palæontology, which has been\r\nthe means of bringing geology to its present state of advancement.\r\nThe study of these extinct forms has afforded valuable indications\r\nas to the physical state of the earth, and as to its climate at\r\ndifferent epochs. This study requires the conjunct labours of the\r\nZoologist, the Botanist, and the Petralogist.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the globe, during the different stages of its\r\nformation, has undergone very evident changes. At the same time there\r\nis no reason to doubt that the plants may all be referred to the\r\ngreat classes distinguished at the present day--namely, Thallogens,\r\nincluding such plants as Lichens, Algæ, and Fungi; Acrogens, such\r\nas Ferns and Lycopods; Gymnosperms, such as Cone-bearing plants and\r\nCycads; Endogens, such as Palms, Lilies, and Grasses; and Exogens,\r\nsuch as the common trees of Britain (excluding the Fir), and the\r\ngreat mass of ordinary flowering plants. The relative proportion of\r\nthese classes, however, has been different, and the predominance of\r\ncertain forms has given a character to the vegetation of different\r\nepochs. The farther we recede in geological history from the present\r\nday, the greater is the difference between the fossil plants and\r\nthose which now occupy the surface. At the time when the coal-beds\r\nwere formed, the plants covering the earth belonged to genera and\r\nspecies not existing at the present day. As we ascend higher, the\r\nsimilarity between the ancient and the modern flora increases, and in\r\nthe latest stratified rocks we have in certain instances an identity\r\nin species and a considerable number of existing genera. At early\r\nepochs the flora appears to have been uniform, to have presented less\r\ndiversity of forms than at present, and to have been similar in the\r\ndifferent quarters of the globe. The vegetation also indicates that\r\nthe nature of the climate was different from that which characterises\r\nthe countries in which these early fossil plants are now found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 1. Section of _Peuce Withami_, after Lindley and\r\nHutton, a fossil Conifer of the coal epoch. Punctated woody tissue\r\nseen.]\r\n\r\nFossil plants are by no means so easily examined as recent species.\r\nThey are seldom found in a complete state. Fragments of stems,\r\nleaves, and fruits, are the data by which the plant is to be\r\ndetermined. It is very rare to find any traces of the flowers. The\r\nparts of fossil plants are usually separated from each other, and\r\nit is difficult to ascertain what are the portions which should be\r\nassociated together so as to complete an individual plant. Specimens\r\nare sometimes preserved, so that the anatomical structure of the\r\norgans, especially of the stem, can be detected by very thin slices\r\nplaced under the microscope. In the case of some stems the presence\r\nof punctated woody tissue (Fig. 1) has proved of great service as\r\nregards fossil Botany; this structure, along with the absence of\r\nlarge pitted ducts, serving to distinguish Conifers. The presence\r\nof scalariform vessels indicates a plant belonging to the vascular\r\nCryptogams, of which the fern is the best known example. The cautions\r\nto be observed in determining fossil plants are noticed by Dr. Hooker\r\nin the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain (vol. ii.\r\np. 387). At the present day, the same fern may have different forms\r\nof fronds, which, unless they were found united, might be reckoned\r\ndistinct genera; and remarkable examples are seen in Niphobolus\r\nrupestris and Lindsæa cordata. Moreover, we find the same form of\r\nfrond belonging to several different genera, which can only be\r\ndistinguished by the fructification; and as this is rarely seen in\r\nfossil ferns, it is often impossible to come to a decided conclusion\r\nin regard to them. A leaf of Stangeria paradoxa was considered\r\nby an eminent botanist as a barren fern frond, but it ultimately\r\nproved to be the leaf of a Cycad. The leaf of Cupania filicifolia,\r\na Dicotyledon, might easily be mistaken for that of a fern; it\r\nresembles much the frond of a fossil fern called Coniopteris. The\r\ndiverse leaves of Sterculia diversifolia, if seen separately, might\r\neasily be referred to different plants. In the same fern we meet\r\nalso with different kinds of venation in the fronds. Similar remarks\r\nmay be made in regard to other plants. Harvey has pointed out many\r\ndifficulties in regard to sea-weeds.\r\n\r\nAs regards the materials for a fossil flora, the following remarks of\r\nHugh Miller deserve attention:--\r\n\r\n\"The authors of Fossil Floras, however able or accomplished they may\r\nbe, have often to found their genera and species, and to frame their\r\nrestorations, when they attempt these, on very inadequate specimens.\r\nFor, were they to pause in their labours until better ones turned up,\r\nthey would find the longest life greatly too short for the completion\r\nof even a small portion of their task. Much of their work must be\r\nof necessity of a provisional character--so much so, that there are\r\nfew possessors of good collections who do not find themselves in\r\ncircumstances to furnish both addenda and errata to our most valuable\r\nworks on Palæontology. And it is only by the free communication of\r\nthese addenda and errata that geologists will be at length enabled\r\nadequately to conceive of the by-past creations, and of that gorgeous\r\nFlora of the Carboniferous age, which seems to have been by far the\r\nmost luxuriant and wonderful which our emphatically ancient earth\r\never saw.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 2. Bark of _Araucaria imbricata_.]\r\n\r\nThe bark of trees at the present day often exhibits different kinds\r\nof markings in its layers. This may be illustrated by a specimen of\r\nAraucaria imbricata, which was destroyed by frost in the Edinburgh\r\nBotanic Garden on 24th December 1861. The tree was 24½ feet high,\r\nwith a circumference of four feet at the base of the stem, and\r\nhad twenty whorls of branches. The external surface of the bark\r\nis represented in Fig. 2. There are seen scars formed in part by\r\nprolongations from the lower part of the leaves, which have been\r\ncut off close to their union with the stem. The base of each leaf\r\nremaining in the bark has the form of a narrow elongated ellipse,\r\nsurrounded by cortical foliar prolongations. The markings on the\r\nbark, when viewed externally, have a somewhat oblique quadrilateral\r\nform. On removing the epiphlœum or outer bark, and examining its\r\ninner surface, we remark a difference in the appearance presented\r\nat the lower and upper part of the stem. In the lower portion the\r\nmarkings have an irregular elliptical form, with a deep depression,\r\nand fissures where the leaves are attached (Fig. 3). Higher up the\r\nepiphlœal markings assume rather more of a quadrilateral form, with\r\nthe depressions less deep, and the fissures for the leaves giving off\r\nprolongations on either side. Farther up the markings are smaller in\r\nsize, obliquely quadrilateral, and present circular clots along the\r\nboundary lines chiefly (Fig. 4). Higher still the quadrilateral form\r\nbecomes more apparent, and the dots disappear (Fig. 5). The epiphlœum\r\nthus presents differences in its markings at different heights on the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 3, 4, and 5. Markings on Araucaria bark.]\r\n\r\nThe part of the bark immediately below the epiphlœum is well\r\ndeveloped, and is of a spongy consistence. When examined\r\nmicroscopically it is seen to be composed of cells of various\r\nshapes--some elongated fusiform, others rhomboidal, others with\r\npointed appendages. The variety of forms is very great, but it is\r\npossible that this may be partly owing to the effects of frost on the\r\ncells. On the spontaneous separation of the bark, the portion below\r\nthe epiphlœum was seen to consist of distinct plates of a more or\r\nless quadrilateral form, with some of the edges concave and others\r\nconvex, a part in the centre indicating the connection with the leaf,\r\nalong with which it is detached. In Fig. 6 a leaf is shown with one\r\nof these plates attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 6. Leaf of Araucaria with a portion of bark.]\r\n\r\nThe appearances presented by the outer and middle bark of Araucaria\r\nimbricata bear a marked resemblance to those exhibited by certain\r\nfossils included in the genera Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. The\r\nsculpturesque markings on the stems of these fossil plants indicate\r\ntheir alliance to the ferns and lycopods of the present epoch. But\r\nit is evident, from these markings, that much caution is required\r\nin making this determination. Other points of structure must be\r\nexamined before a proper decision can be formed. When, for instance,\r\nthe presence of scalariform tissue, or of punctated woody tissue,\r\nhas been satisfactorily shown under the microscope, we are entitled\r\nto hazard an opinion as to the affinities of the fossils. In many\r\ninstances, however, external appearances are the only data on which\r\nto rely for the determination of fossil genera and species; and rash\r\nconclusions have often been drawn by geologists who have not been\r\nconversant with the structure of plants. The Araucaria markings point\r\nout the need of care in drawing conclusions, and their variations at\r\ndifferent parts of the bark indicate the danger of a rash decision\r\nas to species. There can be no doubt that in vegetable Palæontology\r\nthe number of species has been needlessly multiplied--any slight\r\nvariation in form having been reckoned sufficient for specific\r\ndistinction. We can conceive that the Araucaria bark markings in a\r\nfossil state might easily supply several species of Lepidodendron.\r\nA naturalist, with little knowledge of the present flora of the\r\nglobe, ventures sometimes to decide on an isolated fragment. Hence\r\nthe crude descriptions of fossil vegetable forms, and the confusion\r\nin which Palæophytology is involved. Every geologist who examines\r\nfossil plants ought to be well acquainted with the minute structure\r\nof living plants, the forms of their roots, stems, leaves, fronds,\r\nand fructification; the markings on the outer and inner surfaces of\r\ntheir barks, on their stems, and on their rhizomes; the localities in\r\nwhich they grow, and the climates which genera and species affect in\r\nvarious parts of the world. (Professor Balfour in the Proceedings of\r\nthe Royal Society of Edinburgh, April 1862, vol. iv. p. 577.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF PRESERVATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mode in which plants are preserved in a fossil state may be\r\nreferred to four principal classes:--1. Casts of the plants; from\r\nwhich all the original substance and structure have been removed\r\nsubsequently to the burial of the plants, and to the greater or\r\nless induration of the rocks in which they are entombed. Such casts\r\nare occasionally hollow, but more frequently they consist of the\r\namorphous substance of the rock which has filled up the cavity,\r\nand which exhibits, often with remarkable minuteness, the external\r\naspects of the original specimen. 2. Carbonisation; in which the\r\noriginal substance of the plant has been chemically altered and\r\nconverted into lignite or coal. All trace of the form of the original\r\nplant is generally lost, as is the case with the extensive beds of\r\ncoal; but frequently, when the organism has been buried in a bed of\r\nclay, the external appearance is faithfully preserved, as in the\r\nferns and other foliage found in the shales of the coal-measures.\r\n3. Infiltration; in which the vegetable tissues, though carbonised,\r\nretain their original form from the infiltration of some mineral in\r\nsolution, chiefly lime or silex, which has filled the empty cells\r\nand vessels, and so preserved their original form. This mode of\r\npreservation occurs in the calcareous nodules in coal-beds, in the\r\nremarkable ash-beds discovered by Mr. Wünsch in Arran, and generally\r\nin the secondary rocks. 4. Petrifaction; in which the structure is\r\npreserved, but the whole of the original substance has been replaced,\r\natom for atom, by an inorganic substance, generally lime, silex, or\r\nsome ore of iron. This is the condition of the beautiful fossils\r\nfrom Antigua, and of many stems and fruits from rocks of all ages in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nCarbonised vegetables, or those which have passed into the state\r\nof Lignites, often undergo modifications which render it difficult\r\nto understand them rightly. Sometimes a portion of the organs of\r\nvegetables which have passed into the state of lignite is transformed\r\ninto pyrites, or else pyrites of a globular shape is found in\r\nthe middle of the tissue, and may be taken for a character of\r\norganisation. The section of certain Dicotyledonous fossil woods, in\r\nthat case, may resemble Monocotyledons. Petrifaction, as in the case\r\nof silicified woods, often preserves all the tissues equally, at\r\nother times the soft tissues are altered or destroyed; the cellular\r\ntissue being replaced by amorphous chalcedony, while the ligneous\r\nand vascular tissues alone are petrified, so as to preserve their\r\nforms. In some cases the reverse takes place as to these tissues;\r\nthe fibrous portions disappear, leaving cavities, while the cells\r\nare silicified. Sometimes we find the parts regularly silicified\r\nat one place, so as to retain the structure, while at another an\r\namorphous mass of silica is found. In such cases there appear,\r\nas it were, distinct silicified woody bundles in the midst of an\r\namorphous mass. The appearance depends, however, merely on irregular\r\nsilicification or partial petrifaction. Infiltrated fossil woods, by\r\nmeans of chemical tests, are shown to possess portions of vegetable\r\ntissues cemented into a mass by silica. In some cases we find the\r\nvessels and cells separately silicified, without being crushed into a\r\ncompact mass. In these cases, the intercellular substance not being\r\nsilicified, the mass breaks down easily; whereas, when complete\r\nsilicification takes place, the mass is not friable. Coniferous wood\r\nis often friable, from silicified portions being still separated\r\nfrom each other by vegetable tissue more or less entire. During\r\nsilicification, or subsequent to it, it frequently happens that\r\nthe plant has been compressed, broken, and deformed, and that\r\nfissures have been formed which have been subsequently filled with\r\ncrystallised or amorphous silica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 7. _Nicolia Owenii_ (Carr.), from the Tertiary Strata\r\nof Egypt.]\r\n\r\nSilicified stems of trees have been observed in various parts of\r\nthe world, with their structure well preserved, so that their\r\nEndogenous and Exogenous character could be easily determined. The\r\nRev. W. B. Clarke notices the occurrence of a fossil pine-forest\r\nat Kurrur-Kurrân, in the inlet of Awaaba, on the eastern coast of\r\nAustralia. In the inlet there is a formation of conglomerate and\r\nsandstone, with subordinate beds of lignite--the lignite forming\r\nthe so-called Australian coal. Throughout the alluvial flat, stumps\r\nand stools of fossilised trees are seen standing out of the ground,\r\nand one can form no better notion of their aspect than by imagining\r\nwhat the appearance of the existing living forest of Eucalypti and\r\nCasuarinæ would be if the trees were all cut down to a certain level.\r\nIn a lake in the vicinity there are also some fossilised stumps of\r\ntrees, standing vertically. In Derwent Valley, Van Diemen's Land,\r\nfossil silicified trees, in connection with trap rocks, have been\r\nfound in an erect position. One was measured with a stem 6 feet high,\r\na circumference at the base of 7 feet 3 inches, and a diameter at the\r\ntop of 15 inches. The stems are Coniferous, resembling Araucaria. The\r\nouter portion of the stem is of a rich brown glossy agate, while the\r\ninterior is of a snowy whiteness. One hundred concentric rings have\r\nbeen counted. The tissue falls into a powdery mass. Silica is found\r\nin the inside of the tubes, and their substance is also silicified.\r\nThe erect silicified stems of coniferous trees exist in their natural\r\npositions in the \"dirt-bed,\" an old surface soil in the sandstone\r\nstrata of the Purbeck series in the Isle of Portland, Dorsetshire. In\r\nthe petrified forests near Cairo silicified stems have been examined\r\nby Brown, Unger, and Carruthers. They belong to dicotyledonous trees\r\n(not coniferous), to which the names of Nicolia Ægyptiaca and Nicolia\r\nOwenii (Fig. 7) have been given. The wood consists of a slender\r\nprosenchyma, abundantly penetrated by large ducts. The walls of the\r\nducts are marked by small, regularly arranged, oval, and somewhat\r\ncompressed hexagonal reticulations. The ducts have transverse\r\ndiaphragms. There are numerous medullary rays. The wood in their\r\nstems is converted into chalcedony. (Carruthers on Petrified Forest\r\nnear Cairo. Geol. Mag., July 1870.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the structure of fossil plants is well preserved, it may be\r\nseen under the microscope by making thin sections after the mode\r\nrecommended by Mr. William Nicol, the inventor of the prism which\r\nbears his name, and to whose memory Unger dedicated the genus\r\nNicolia, which has just been described as constituting the petrified\r\nforest at Cairo. The following is a description of the process of\r\npreparing fossils for the microscope, by Mr. Alexander Bryson. (Edin.\r\nN. Phil. Journal, N. S. iii. 297. Balfour's Botanist's Companion, p.\r\n30.)\r\n\r\n\"The usual mode of proceeding in making a section of fossil wood is\r\nsimple, though tedious. The first process is to flatten the specimen\r\nto be operated on by grinding it on a flat _lap_ made of lead charged\r\nwith emery or corundum powder. It must now be rendered perfectly flat\r\nby hand on a plate of metal or glass, using much finer emery than in\r\nthe first operation of grinding. The next operation is to cement the\r\nobject to the glass plate. Both the plate of glass and the fossil\r\nto be cemented must be heated to a temperature rather inconvenient\r\nfor the fingers to bear. By this means moisture and adherent air are\r\ndriven off, especially from the object to be operated on. Canada\r\nbalsam is now to be equally spread over both plate and object, and\r\nexposed again to heat, until the redundant turpentine in the balsam\r\nhas been driven off by evaporation. The two surfaces are now to be\r\nconnected while hot, and a slow circular motion, with pressure, given\r\neither to the plate or object, for the purpose of throwing out the\r\nsuperabundant balsam and globules of included air. The object should\r\nbe below and the glass plate above, as we then can see when all the\r\nair is removed, by the pressure and motion indicated. It is proper\r\nto mention that too much balsam is more favourable for the expulsion\r\nof the air-bubbles than too little. When cold, the Canada balsam\r\nwill be found hard and adhering, and the specimen fit for slitting.\r\nThis process has hitherto been performed by using a disc of thin\r\nsheet-iron, so much employed by the tinsmith, technically called\r\n_sheet-tin_. The tin coating ought to be partially removed by heating\r\nthe plate, and when hot rubbing off much of the extraneous tin by a\r\npiece of cloth. The plate has now to be planished on the polished\r\n_stake_ of the tinsmith, until quite flat. If the plate is to be\r\nused in the lathe, and by the usual method, it ought to be planished\r\nso as to possess a slight convexity. This gives a certain amount\r\nof rigidity to the edge, which is useful in slitting by the hand;\r\nwhile by the method of mechanical slitting, about to be described,\r\nthis convexity is inadmissible. The tin plate, when mounted on an\r\nappropriate chuck in the lathe, must be turned quite true, with its\r\nedge slightly rounded and made perfectly smooth by a fine-cut file.\r\nThe edge of the disc is now to be charged with diamond powder. This\r\nis done by mingling the diamond powder with oil, and placing it on a\r\npiece of the hardest agate, and then turning the disc slowly round.\r\nThen, by holding the agate with the diamond powder with a moderate\r\npressure against the edge of the disc, it is thoroughly charged with\r\na host of diamond points, becoming, as it were, a saw with invisible\r\nteeth. In pounding the diamond, some care is necessary, as also a\r\nfitting mortar. The mortar should be made of an old steel die, if\r\naccessible; if not, a mass of steel, slightly conical, the base of\r\nwhich ought to be 2 inches in diameter, and the upper part 1½ inch.\r\nA cylindrical hole is now to be turned out in the centre, of ¾ths of\r\nan inch diameter, and about 1 inch deep. This, when hardened, is the\r\nmortar; for safety it may be annealed to a straw colour. The pestle\r\nis merely a cylinder of steel, fitting the hollow mortar but loosely,\r\nand having a ledge or edging of an eighth of an inch projecting round\r\nit, but sufficiently raised above the upper surface of the mortar, so\r\nas not to come in contact while pounding the diamond. The point of\r\nthe pestle ought only to be hardened and annealed to a straw colour,\r\nand should be of course convex, fitting the opposing and equal\r\nconcavity of the mortar. The purpose of the projecting ledge is to\r\nprevent the smaller particles of diamond spurting out when the pestle\r\nis struck by the hammer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 8. Mr. Bryson's instrument for slitting fossils. A\r\nvery simple slicing and polishing machine has been invented by Mr. J.\r\nB. Jordan of the Mining Record Office, and is sold by Messrs. Cotton\r\nand Johnson, Grafton Street, Soho, London. It costs about £10.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bryson has contrived an instrument for slitting fossils. The\r\ninstrument is placed on the table of a common lathe, which is, of\r\ncourse, the source of motion (Fig. 8). It consists of a Watt's\r\nparallel motion, with four joints, attached to a basement fixed\r\nto the table of the lathe. This base has a motion (for adjustment\r\nonly) in a horizontal plane, by which we may be enabled to place the\r\nupper joint in a parallel plane with the spindle of the lathe. This\r\nmay be called the azimuthal adjustment. The adjustment, which in\r\nan astronomical instrument is called the plane of right ascension,\r\nis given by a pivot in the top of the base, and clamped by a screw\r\nbelow. This motion in right ascension gives us the power of adjusting\r\nthe perpendicular planes of motion, so that the object to be slit\r\npasses down from the circumference of the slitting-plate to nearly\r\nits centre, in a perfectly parallel plane. When this adjustment\r\nis made accurately, and the slitting-plate well primed and flat,\r\na very thin and parallel slice is obtained. This jointed frame is\r\ncounterpoised and supported by a lever, the centre of which is\r\nmovable in a pillar standing perpendicularly from the lathe table.\r\nAttached to the lever is a screw of three threads, by which the\r\ncounterpoise weight is adjusted readily to the varying weight of the\r\nobject to be slit and the necessary pressure required on the edge of\r\nthe slitting-plate.\r\n\r\nThe object is fixed to the machine by a pneumatic chuck. It consists\r\nof an iron tube, which passes through an aperture on the upper\r\njoint of the guiding-frame, into which is screwed a round piece of\r\ngun-metal, slightly hollowed in the centre, but flat towards the\r\nedge. This gun-metal disc is perforated by a small hole communicating\r\nwith the interior of the iron tube. This aperture permits the air\r\nbetween the glass plate and the chuck to be exhausted by a small\r\nair-syringe at the other end. The face of this chuck is covered with\r\na thin film of soft india-rubber not vulcanised, also perforated with\r\na small central aperture. When the chuck is properly adjusted, and\r\nthe india-rubber carefully stretched over the face of the gun-metal,\r\none or two pulls of the syringe-piston is quite sufficient to\r\nmaintain a very large object under the action of the slitting-plate.\r\nBy this method no time is lost; the adhesion is made instantaneously,\r\nand as quickly broken by opening a small screw, to admit air between\r\nthe glass plate and the chuck, when the object is immediately\r\nreleased. Care must be taken, in stretching the india-rubber over the\r\nface of the chuck, to make it very equal in its distribution, and as\r\nthin as is consistent with strength. When this material is obtained\r\nfrom the shops, it presents a series of slight grooves, and is rather\r\nhard for our purpose. It ought, therefore, to be slightly heated,\r\nwhich renders it soft and pliant, and in this state should now be\r\nstretched over the chuck, and a piece of soft copper wire tied round\r\nit, a slight groove being cut in the periphery of the chuck to detain\r\nthe wire in its place. When by use the surface of the india-rubber\r\nbecomes flat, smooth, and free from the grooves which at first mar\r\nits usefulness, a specimen may be slit of many square inches, without\r\nresort being had to another exhaustion by the syringe. But when a\r\nlarge, hard, siliceous object has to be slit, it is well for the\r\nsake of safety to try the syringe piston, and observe if it returns\r\nforcibly to the bottom of the cylinder, which evidences the good\r\ncondition of the vacuum of the chuck.\r\n\r\nAfter the operation of slitting, the plate must be removed from\r\nthe spindle of the lathe, and the flat lead _lap_ substituted. The\r\npneumatic chuck is now to be reversed, and the specimen placed in\r\ncontact with the grinder. By giving a slightly tortuous motion to\r\nthe specimen, that is, using the motion of the various joints, the\r\nobject is ground perfectly flat when the length of both arms of the\r\njoints is perfectly equal. Should the leg of the first joint on the\r\nright-hand side be the longer, the specimen will be ground hollow; if\r\nshorter, it will be ground convex. But if, as before stated, they are\r\nof equal length, a perfectly parallel surface will be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn operating on siliceous objects, I have found soap and water\r\nquite as speedy and efficacious as oil, which is generally used;\r\nwhile calcareous fossils must be slit by a solution of common soda\r\nin water. This solution of soda, if made too strong, softens the\r\nindia-rubber on the face of the pneumatic chuck, and renders a\r\nnew piece necessary; but if care is taken to keep the solution of\r\nmoderate strength, one piece of india-rubber may last for six months.\r\nThe thinner and flatter it becomes, the better hold the glass takes,\r\nuntil a puncture occurs in the outer portion, and a new piece is\r\nrendered necessary.\r\n\r\nThe polishing of the section is the last operation. This is performed\r\nin various ways, according to the material of which the organism is\r\ncomposed. If siliceous, a _lap_ of tin is to be used, about the same\r\nsize as the grinding _lap_. Having turned the face smooth and flat, a\r\nseries of very fine notches are to be made all over the surface. This\r\noperation is accomplished by holding the edge of an old dinner-knife\r\nalmost perpendicular to the surface of the _lap_ while rotating;\r\nthis produces a series of _criddles_, or slight asperities, which\r\ndetain the polishing substance. The polishing substance used on the\r\ntin lap is technically called lapidaries' rot-stone, and is applied\r\nby slightly moistening the mass, and pressing it firmly against\r\nthe polisher, care being taken to scrape off the outer surface,\r\nwhich often contains grit. The specimen is then to be pressed with\r\nsome degree of force against the revolving tin _lap_ or polisher,\r\ncarefully changing the plane of action, by moving the specimen in\r\nvarious directions over the surface.\r\n\r\nTo polish calcareous objects, another method must be adopted as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nA _lap_ or disc of willow wood is to be adapted to the spindle of the\r\nlathe, three inches in thickness, and about the diameter of the other\r\nlaps (10 inches), the axis of the wood being parallel to the spindle\r\nof the lathe, that is, the acting surface of the wood is the end of\r\nthe fibres, the section being transverse.\r\n\r\nThis polisher must be turned quite flat and smoothed by a plane, as\r\nthe willow, from its softness, is peculiarly difficult to turn. It\r\nis also of consequence to remark that both sides should be turned,\r\nso that the _lap_, when dry, is quite parallel. This _lap_ is most\r\nconveniently adapted to the common face chuck of a lathe with a\r\nconical screw, so that either surface may be used. This is made\r\nevident, when we state that this polisher is always used moist, and,\r\nto keep both surfaces parallel, must be entirely plunged in water\r\nbefore using, as both surfaces must be equally moist, otherwise the\r\ndry surface will be concave and the moist one convex. The polishing\r\nsubstance used with this _lap_ is putty powder (oxide of tin), which\r\nought to be well washed, to free it from grit. The calcareous fossils\r\nbeing finely ground, are speedily polished by this method. To polish\r\nsofter substances, a piece of cloth may be spread over the wooden\r\n_lap_, and finely-levigated chalk used as a polishing medium.\r\n\r\nIn order to study fossil plants well, there must be an acquaintance\r\nwith systematic botany, a knowledge of the microscopical structure\r\nof all the organs of plants, such as their roots, stems, barks,\r\nleaves, fronds, and fruit; of the markings which they exhibit on\r\ntheir different surfaces, and of the scars which some of them\r\nleave when they decay. It is only thus we can expect to determine\r\naccurately the living affinities of the fossil. Brongniart says,\r\nthat before comparing a fossil vegetable with living plants, it is\r\nnecessary to reconstruct as completely as possible the portion of\r\nthe plant under examination, to determine the relations of these\r\nportions to the other organs of the same plant, and to complete the\r\nplant if possible, by seeing whether, in the fossils of the same\r\nlocality, there may not be some which belong to the same plant. The\r\nconnection of the different parts of the same plant is one of the\r\nmost important problems in Palæophytology, and the neglect of it has\r\nled to many mistakes. In some instances the data have been sufficient\r\nto enable botanists to refer a fossil plant to a genus of the present\r\nday, so that we have fossil species of the genera Ulmus, Alnus,\r\nPinus, etc. Sometimes the plant is shown to be allied to a living\r\ngenus, but differing in some essential point, or wanting something to\r\ncomplete the identity, and it is then marked by the addition of the\r\nterm _ites_, as Pinites, Thuites, Zamites, etc.\r\n\r\nBefore drawing conclusions as to the climate or physical condition\r\nof the globe at different geological epochs, the botanist must be\r\nwell informed as to the vegetation of different countries, as to the\r\nsoils and localities in which certain plants grow, whether on land\r\nor in the sea, or in lakes, in dry or marshy ground, in valleys or\r\non mountains, or in estuaries, in hot, temperate, or cold regions.\r\nGreat caution must be employed also in predicating from one species\r\nthe conditions of another, inasmuch as different species of the\r\nsame genus frequently exist in very different habitats, and under\r\nalmost opposite conditions of moisture and temperature. It is\r\nonly by a careful consideration of all these particulars that any\r\nprobable inferences can be drawn as to the condition of the globe.\r\nConsidering the physiognomy of vegetation at the present day, we\r\nfind remarkable associations of forms. The Palms, although generally\r\ncharacteristic of very warm countries, are by no means confined to\r\nthem; Chamærops humilis extending to Europe as far as lat. 43° to 44°\r\nN., and C. palmetto in North America to lat. 34° to 36° N., while\r\nC. Fortunei, from the north of China, is perfectly hardy in the\r\nsouth of England. Major Madden mentions the association of Palms and\r\nBamboos with Conifers at considerable elevations on the Himalayas.\r\n(Edin. Bot. Soc. Trans. iv., p. 185.) Epiphytic Orchids, which\r\nusually characterise warm climates, have representatives at great\r\nelevations, as Oncidium nubigenum at 14,000 feet in the Andes, and\r\nEpidendrum frigidum at from 12,000 to 13,000 feet in the Columbia\r\nmountains. These facts point out the care necessary before drawing\r\nconclusions as to the climate which fossil plants may be supposed to\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks of which the globe is composed are divided into two\r\ngreat classes--the Stratified or Aqueous, and the Unstratified or\r\nIgneous. The stratified rocks frequently contain fossil remains,\r\nand are then called fossiliferous; those with no such remains are\r\ndesignated non-fossiliferous or azoic. The igneous unstratified\r\nrocks, included under the names of Granitic and Trappean, show no\r\nappearance of animal or vegetable remains. Those trap rocks, however,\r\nwhich have been formed of loose volcanic ashes have often enclosed\r\nand preserved the remains of plants and animals; while even between\r\nthe successive beds of old lava-like trap rocks organic remains are\r\nsometimes found. Thus, in Antrim, near the Giant's Causeway, deposits\r\ncontaining vegetable remains occur inter-stratified with basaltic\r\nrocks. These remains are of Miocene age, and have been referred to\r\nconiferous plants, beeches, oaks, plane trees, etc. Similar plants\r\nhave been discovered in a similar position by the Duke of Argyll\r\nin the island of Mull. In trap rocks near Edinburgh, lignite with\r\ndistinct structure has also been detected. Silicified wood and coal,\r\nimbedded in trap rocks, have been seen in Kerguelen's Land. The wood\r\nis found enclosed in basalt, whilst the coal crops out in ravines,\r\nin close contact with the overlying porphyritic and amygdaloidal\r\ngreenstone. Hooker has also seen silicified wood, in connection with\r\ntrap, in Macquarrie's Plains, in Tasmania. Several beds of trap-tuff\r\nor ash, formed into solid compact rock by infiltrated carbonate of\r\nlime, occur in the north-east of Arran, which contain numerous stems,\r\nbranches, and fruits of carboniferous plants. These represent the\r\nremains of successive forests which grew on this locality, and were\r\none after the other destroyed by the ash-showers poured forth from a\r\nneighbouring volcano during its intermittent periods of activity.\r\n\r\nFossil remains are extremely rare in certain rocks, which, from the\r\nchanges they have undergone, have been denominated Metamorphic.\r\nThese include Gneiss and Mica-slate, which are stratified rocks\r\nsubsequently altered by heat and other causes, and so completely\r\nmetamorphosed that the traces of organisms have been nearly\r\nobliterated. Nevertheless, recognisable traces of plant and animal\r\nremains have been found in what were recently thought to be azoic\r\nrocks. The absence of organic remains in rocks is therefore not\r\nsufficient to enable us to state that these rocks were formed before\r\nanimals or vegetables existed.\r\n\r\nThe stratified rocks which contain fossils have been divided into\r\nthree great groups--the Palæozoic, the Secondary, and the Tertiary,\r\nor into Palæozoic and Neozoic groups. The formations included under\r\nthese are exhibited in the following table, taken from Lyell's Manual\r\nof Geology:--\r\n\r\n  1.  Recent.               } Post Tertiary. }  Recent.\r\n  2.

Their state of preservation\r\ndepends much on their structure. Cellular plants have probably in a\r\ngreat measure been destroyed, and hence their rarity; while those\r\nhaving a woody structure have been preserved.

In the ancient period there is a predominance of Acrogenous\r\nCryptogamic plants; this is succeeded by a period in which there is\r\na preponderance of Gymnospermous Dicotyledons; while a third period\r\nis marked by the predominance of Angiospermous Dicotyledons. There\r\nis thus--1. The reign of Acrogens, which includes the plants of the\r\nDevonian, Carboniferous, and Permian periods. During these periods\r\nthere seems to be a predominance of Ferns, and a great development of\r\narborescent Lycopodiaceæ, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, and\r\nwith them are associated some Gynmosperms, allied to Araucaria, and\r\nsome anomalous plants, as Noeggerathia. 2. The reign of Gymnosperms,\r\ncomprehending the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Here we meet with\r\nnumerous Coniferæ and Cycadaceæ, while Ferns are less abundant. 3.\r\nThe reign of Angiosperms, embracing the Cretaceous and the Tertiary\r\nperiods. This is characterised by the predominance of Angiospermous\r\nDicotyledons, a class of plants which constitute more than\r\nthree-fourths of the present vegetable productions of the globe, and\r\nwhich appear to have acquired a predominance from the commencement of\r\nthe Tertiary formations. These plants appear sparingly even at the\r\nbeginning of the chalk formation in Europe, but are more abundant in\r\nthis formation as developed in North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORA OF THE PRIMARY OR PALÆOZOIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF ACROGENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present day, acrogenous plants are represented by cellular\r\nand vascular Cryptogams. In considering fossil plants our attention\r\nis specially directed to the latter. In the recent Floras, vascular\r\nAcrogens are represented by such plants as Ferns, Lycopods, and\r\nEquisetums. Some of them have an arborescent habit, but the greater\r\nnumber are shrubby and herbaceous. Many of them have creeping\r\nrhizomes, which are either subterranean, or run along the surface\r\nof the ground. One of these arborescent forms is seen in Tree-ferns\r\n(Fig. 9). Another form with a rhizome is seen in Fig. 10. The trunks\r\nof ferns are marked by scars, which indicate the parts where the\r\nbases of the fronds were attached, and where the vascular tissue\r\npasses out from the interior (Fig. 11, _a_ and _b_). A transverse\r\nsection of the stem (Fig. 12) shows a continuous cylinder of\r\nscalariform vessels (Fig. 13), enclosing a large mass of cellular\r\ntissue frequently penetrated by small scalariform bundles. The\r\ncylinder is pierced by meshes, from the inner sides of which rise the\r\nvascular bundles going to the leaves, while some of the free bundles\r\nof the axis pass through the mesh, carrying with them a portion of\r\nthe cellular tissue into the petiole. The fructification consists\r\nof spore-cases (sporangia), often with an elastic ring round them,\r\ncontaining spores in their interior (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 9. Tree-fern, with a slender cylindrical trunk and a\r\ncrown of drooping fronds. It is a vascular acrogen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 10. _Asplenium_; a species of Spleenwort. A. Rhizome,\r\n_r_, covered with the bases (stalks or stipes) of the fronds; _f_,\r\nfronds in bud, rolled up in a circinate manner (this is very rarely\r\nseen in fossil ferns); _g_, fronds bearing fructification on their\r\nbacks. B. Portion of a frond separated to show the linear sori or\r\nclusters of sporangia (spore-cases).]\r\n\r\nAmong Acrogens of the present day there are also plants belonging\r\nto the natural order Lycopodiaceæ or Club-mosses (Fig. 15), having\r\ncreeping stems, which give rise to leafy branches. The leaves are\r\nsmall, sessile, and moss-like, and the fructification consists of two\r\nkinds of cellular bodies, small spores or microspores (Fig. 16),\r\nand large spores or macrospores (Fig. 17). They consist of cellular\r\nand vascular tissues, the latter occurring in the form of woody,\r\nannular, and scalariform vessels, which occupy the axis or central\r\npart of the stem. They differ from ferns in the distribution of\r\ntheir vascular bundles. The order is represented also by such plants\r\nas Selaginella, Psilotum, Phylloglossum, and Isoetes. In the plant\r\ncalled Isoetes (Quillwort) there is a peculiar short stem which does\r\nnot increase in height. It produces additions laterally, so that the\r\nstem increases in thickness. The leaves continue to multiply, and\r\nbear fructification at their bases. They have both large and small\r\nspores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11, _a_. Fig. 11, _b_.

The\r\nfructification, _f_, at the extremity, is in the form of a cone\r\nbearing polygonal scales, under which are spore-cases containing\r\nspores with filaments.]\r\n\r\nAnother important order of vascular Acrogens is the Equisetaceæ\r\nor Horse-tails (Fig. 18). These are Cryptogams, having rhizomes,\r\nbearing hollow, striated branches, which secrete in their epidermis\r\na considerable amount of silex. These branches are jointed and have\r\nmembranous sheaths at the articulations, which are whorls of leaves\r\nreduced to a very rudimentary condition. The fructification consists\r\nof cone-like bodies (Fig. 18, _f_) bearing peltate polygonal scales,\r\nunder which are spore-cases (Fig. 19), enclosing spores with four\r\nhygrometric club-shaped filaments called elaters (Figs. 20 and 21).\r\nAt the present day some of these plants in tropical regions have\r\nstems of 15 or 16 feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19-21.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 19.

Spore of Equisetum, with the filaments (elaters)\r\nexpanded.]\r\n\r\nAmong vascular Acrogens is included the natural order Marsileaceæ\r\nor Rhizocarpeæ, the Pepperworts (Fig. 22). The order consists of\r\naquatic plants, with creeping stems, bearing leaves, which are either\r\nlinear, or divided into three or more wedge-shaped portions not\r\nunlike clover. The fructification is at the base of the leaf-stalks,\r\nand consists of sacs (sporocarps) containing spores of two kinds,\r\nmicrospores and macrospores. The order contains Marsilea, Pilularia,\r\nAzolla, and Salvinia.\r\n\r\nFor a fuller account of Acrogenous plants, see Balfour's Class Book\r\nof Botany, p. 954.\r\n\r\nThese orders are represented in the Palæozoic flora. Many of the\r\nfossil species assume a large size, and show a greater degree\r\nof development than is seen in their recent congeners. The most\r\nimportant coal plants belong to the Ferns, Lycopods, and Horse-tails.\r\nThe examination of the structure and conformation of the plants of\r\nthe present flora assists much in the determination of the fossil\r\ncarboniferous flora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 22. _Marsilea Fabri_, a species of Pepperwort or\r\nRhizocarp, with a creeping stem, quadrifoliate stalked leaves on one\r\nside, and roots on the other. The fructification, _s_, is at the base\r\nof the leaves, and consists of sporangia, called sporocarps.]\r\n\r\nIn the lower Palæozoic strata the plants which have been detected\r\nare few. In the Silurian and Cambrian systems, we meet with the\r\nremains of ancient marine plants, as well as a few terrestrial\r\nspecies. Even in the still older Laurentian rocks, if the remarkable\r\nstructure known as Eozoon canadense be considered, as it generally\r\nis, an animal, the existence of contemporary plants may be inferred,\r\ninasmuch as without vegetable life animals could not obtain food.\r\nIn the Lower Silurian or Grauwacke, near Girvan, Hugh Miller found\r\na species resembling Zostera in form and appearance. In the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone of Scotland he detected Fucoids, a Lepidodendron,\r\nand Lignite with a distinct Coniferous structure resembling that of\r\nAraucaria,[1] besides a remarkable pinnate frond. In the middle Old\r\nRed of Forfarshire, as seen in the Arbroath pavement, he found a\r\nfern with reniform pinnæ and a Lepidodendron. In the Upper Old Red,\r\nnear Dunse, a Calamite and the well-known Irish fern Cyclopteris\r\nHibernica occur.[2] This fern, Palæopteris Hibernica of Schimper\r\n(Plate I. Figs. 1 to 4), along with Sigillaria dichotoma, is very\r\nabundant in beds of the same age in the south of Ireland, from\r\nwhich the specimens described by Edward Forbes were obtained. The\r\nfructification has recently been discovered. This shows that the fern\r\nbelongs to the Hymenophylleæ, and is consequently nearly related to\r\nthe equally famous Killarney fern, Trichomanes radicans.\r\n\r\nMr. Carruthers states that the frond-stalk of this fern is thick,\r\nof considerable length, and clothed with large scales, which form\r\na dense covering at the somewhat enlarged base. The well-defined\r\nseparation observed in several specimens probably indicates that\r\nthe frond-stalks were articulated to the stem or freely separated\r\nfrom it, and some root-like structures which occur on the slabs with\r\nthe ferns may be their creeping rhizomes. The pinnæ are linear,\r\nobtuse, and almost sessile. The pinnules are numerous, overlapping,\r\nof an ovate or oblong-ovate form, somewhat cuneate below, and with\r\na decurrent base. The veins are very numerous, uniform, repeatedly\r\ndichotomous, and run out to the margin, where they form a slight\r\nserration. Single pinnules rather larger than those of the pinnæ\r\nare placed over the free spaces of the rachis, as was pointed out\r\nby Brongniart. Carruthers has not met with any recent fern in which\r\nthis occurs; but it has been observed in several fossil species, as\r\nin the allied American Palæopteris Halliana (Sch.), in Sphenopteris\r\nerosa (Morris), and others. The pinnules are sometimes entirely,\r\nbut only partially fertile. The ovate-oblong sori are generally\r\nsingle and two-lipped, the slit passing one-third of the way down\r\nthe sorus. The vein is continued as a free receptacle in the\r\ncentre of the cup or cyst, as in existing Hymenophylleæ, in which\r\nit is included, not reaching beyond its entire portion. In some\r\nspecimens the receptacle is broad or thick, indicating the presence\r\nof something besides itself in the cup, and giving the appearance\r\nthat would be produced if it were covered with sporangia; there is\r\nno indication on the outer surface which might have been expected\r\nfrom the separate sporangia. The compression of the specimens in the\r\nrock, which has made the free receptacle appear like a vein on the\r\nwall of the cup, together with the highly altered condition of the\r\nrock in which the fossils are contained, accounts for the imperfect\r\npreservation of the minute structures. The interpretation here given\r\nof the fructification of this interesting fossil exhibits so close\r\na resemblance to what we find in the living genus Hymenophyllum,\r\nthat, were it not for the vegetative portions, it would be placed\r\nin that genus. Several ferns have been described by Bunbury from\r\nDevonian rocks at Oporto. A still more extensive and varied land\r\nflora of Devonian age (or Erian, as he calls it) has been described\r\nand illustrated by Principal Dawson from the rocks of that period\r\noccurring in Canada; and during a recent visit to Britain he has\r\ncorrelated many of the fragments collected by Miller, Peach, and\r\nothers, with the American species he has described. The following\r\nare some of the fossil plants from beds older than the Carboniferous\r\nsystem:[3]--Prototaxites Logani, Dadoxylon Ouangondianum, Calamites\r\ntransitionis, Asterophyllites parvulus, Sphenophyllum antiquum,\r\nLepidodendron Gaspianum, Lepidostrobus Richardsoni, L. Matthewi,\r\nPsilophyton princeps, P. robustius, Selaginites formosus, Cordaites\r\nRobbii, C. angustifolius, Cyclopteris Jacksoni.\r\n\r\nFrom the microscopic examination of the structure of specimens of\r\nfossil trunks described under the name of Prototaxites Logani, and\r\nwhich Principal Dawson believes to be the oldest known instance of\r\nConiferous wood, Mr. Carruthers has come to the conclusion that\r\nthey are really the stems of huge Algæ, belonging to at least more\r\nthan one genus. They are very gigantic when contrasted with the\r\nordinary Algæ of our existing seas, nevertheless some approach to\r\nthem in size is made in the huge and tree-like Lessonias which Dr.\r\nHooker found in the Antarctic Seas, and which have stems about 20\r\nfeet high, with a diameter so great that they have been collected by\r\nmariners in these regions for fuel, under the belief that they were\r\ndrift-wood. They are as thick as a man's thigh. Schimper regards the\r\nPsilophyton of Dawson (Plate IV. Fig. 5) as allied to Pilularia, one\r\nof the Rhizocarps (Fig. 22), and Carruthers places it among the true\r\nLycopodiaceæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous period is one of the most important as regards\r\nfossil plants. The vegetable forms are numerous, and have a great\r\nsimilarity throughout the whole system, whether exhibited in the Old\r\nor the New World. The important substance called Coal owes its origin\r\nto the plants of this epoch. It has been subjected to great pressure\r\nand long-continued metamorphic action, and hence the appearance\r\nof the plants has been much altered. It is difficult to give a\r\ndefinition of Coal. The varieties of it are numerous. There is a\r\ngradual transition from Anthracite to Household and Parrot Coal; and\r\nthe limit between Coal and what is called bituminous shale is by no\r\nmeans distinct. Coal may be said to be chemically-altered vegetable\r\nmatter inter-stratified with the rocks, and capable of being used as\r\nfuel. On examining thin sections of coal under the microscope, we can\r\ndetect vegetable tissues both of a cellular and vascular nature. In\r\nWigan cannel coal, vegetable structure is seen throughout the whole\r\nmass. Such is likewise the case with other cannel, parrot, and gas\r\ncoals. In common household coal, also, evident traces of organic\r\ntissue have been observed. In some kinds of coal punctated woody\r\ntissue (Plate III. Fig. 5) has been detected, in others scalariform\r\ntissue (Plate III. Fig. 6), as well as cells of different kinds.\r\nSporangia are also frequently found in the substance of coal, as\r\nshown by Mr. Daw in that from Fordel (Plate III. Figs. 1 to 3); and\r\nsome beds, like the Better bed of Bradford, are composed almost\r\nentirely of these sporangia imbedded in their shed microspores,\r\nas has been recently shown by Huxley. The structure of coal in\r\ndifferent beds, and in different parts of the same bed, seems to vary\r\naccording to the nature of the plants by which it has been formed,\r\nas well as to the metamorphic action which it has undergone. Hence\r\nthe different varieties of coal which are worked. The occurrence of\r\npunctated tissue indicates the presence of Coniferæ in the coal-bed,\r\nwhile scalariform vessels point to ferns, and their allies, such as\r\nSigillaria and Lepidodendron. The anatomical structure of the stems\r\nof these plants may have some effect on the microscopic characters\r\nof the coal produced from them. In some cannel coals structure\r\nresembling that of Acrogens has been observed. A brownish-yellow\r\nsubstance is occasionally present, which seems to yield abundance of\r\ncarburetted hydrogen gas when exposed to heat.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in general each bed of coal is accompanied by the\r\nremains of a somewhat limited amount of species. Their number,\r\nparticularly in the most ancient beds, is scarcely more than eight\r\nor ten. In other cases the number is more considerable, but rarely\r\nmore than thirty or forty. In the same coal-basin each layer often\r\ncontains several characteristic species which are not met with\r\neither in the beds above or below. Thus, there are sometimes small\r\nlocal or temporary floras, each of which has given birth to layers\r\nof coal. The quantity of carbonaceous and other matter required to\r\nform a bed of coal is immense. Maclaren has calculated that one acre\r\nof coal three feet thick is equal to the produce of 1940 acres of\r\nforest.[4] The proportion of carbon varies in different kinds of\r\ncoal. Along with it there is always more or less of earthy matter\r\nwhich constitutes the ashes. When the earthy substances are in such\r\nquantity that the coaly deposit will not burn as fuel, then we have\r\nwhat is called a shale. The coal contains plants similar to those of\r\nthe shales and sandstones above and below it. Underneath a coal-seam\r\nlies the Underclay, containing roots only, and representing the\r\nancient soil; then comes the Coal, composed of plants whose roots are\r\nin the clay, with others which have grown along with and upon them,\r\nin a manner precisely similar to the growth of peat at the present\r\nday; while above the coal is the Shale, marking how mud was laid\r\ndown on the plants, and bearing evidences of vigorous vegetation\r\non neighbouring land, from which currents brought down the fine\r\nsediment, mingled with broken pieces of plants.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of coal in the English coal-fields is about 50\r\nor 60 feet. In the Mid-Lothian field there are 108 feet of coal.\r\nCoal-beds are worked at 1725 feet below the sea-level, and probably\r\nextend down to upwards of 20,000 feet. They rise to 12,000 feet above\r\nthe sea-level, and at Huanuco, in Peru, to 14,700.[5] It is said that\r\nthe first coal-works were opened at Belgium in 1198, and soon after\r\nin England and Scotland; it was not till the fifteenth century that\r\nthey were opened in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe following calculations have been made as to the extent of the\r\ncoal formation in different countries, and the amount of coal\r\nraised:--[6]\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  |           COUNTRIES.           | Square Miles of| Annual Production|\r\n  |                                | Coal Formation.|  of Coal in Tons.|\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  |Great Britain and Ireland       |       5,400    |      65,887,900  |\r\n  |British North America           |       7,530    |       1,500,000  |\r\n  |United States                   |     196,650    |       5,000,000  |\r\n  |Belgium                         |         518    |       8,409,330  |\r\n  |France                          |       1,719    |       7,740,317  |\r\n  |Prussia and Austria             |        ----    |       4,200,000  |\r\n  |Saxony                          |          30    |       1,000,000  |\r\n  |Russia                          |         100    |       3,500,000  |\r\n  |Japan, China, Borneo, Australia,|                |                  |\r\n  |     etc.                       |        ----    |       2,000,000  |\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  |     Total Produce of the World |        ----    |      99,237,547  |\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of coal annually raised over the globe appears\r\nthus to be about 100 millions of tons, of which the produce of Great\r\nBritain is more than two-thirds, and would be sufficient to girdle\r\nthe earth at the equator with a belt of 3 feet in thickness and\r\nnearly 5 feet in width.

Of the last number there are 6 Thallogens, 346\r\nAcrogens, 135 Gymnosperms, and 13 doubtful plants. This appears\r\nto be a very scanty vegetation, as far as regards the number of\r\nspecies. It is only equal to about 1/20th of the number of species\r\nnow growing on the surface of the soil of Europe. Although,\r\nhowever, the number of species was small, yet it is probable that\r\nthe individuals of a species were numerous. The proportion of\r\nFerns was very large. There are between 200 and 300 enumerated.\r\nSchimper thinks there are 7 species congeneric with Lycopodium\r\nfound in the coal-measures. The following are some of the\r\nCryptogamous and Phanerogamous genera belonging to the flora of\r\nthe Carboniferous period:--Cyclopteris, Neuropteris, Odontopteris,\r\nSphenopteris, Hymenophyllites, Alethopteris, Pecopteris, Coniopteris,\r\nCladophlebis, Senftenbergia, Lonchopteris, Glossopteris, Caulopteris,\r\nLepidodendron (Lepidostrobus, Lepidophyllum, Knorria), Flemingites,\r\nUlodendron, Halonia, Psaronius, Sigillaria and Stigmaria, Calamites\r\n(Asterophyllites and Sphenophyllum), Noeggerathia, Walchia, Peuce,\r\nDadoxylon, Pissadendron, Trigonocarpum.\r\n\r\nFerns are the carboniferous fossil group which present the most\r\nobvious and recognisable relationship to plants of the present day.\r\nWhile cellular plants and those with lax tissues have lost their\r\ncharacters by the maceration to which they were subjected before\r\nfossilisation took place, ferns are more durable, and retain their\r\nstructure. It is rare, however, to find the stalk of the frond\r\ncompletely preserved down to its base. It is also rare to find\r\nfructification present. In this respect, fossil Ferns resemble\r\nTree-ferns of the present day, the fronds of which rarely exhibit\r\nfructification. Hooker states that of two or three kinds of New\r\nZealand Tree-fern, not one specimen in a thousand bears a single\r\nfertile frond, though all abound in barren ones. Only one surface\r\nof the fossil Fern-frond is exposed, and that generally the least\r\nimportant in a botanical point of view. Fructification is sometimes\r\nevidently seen, as figured by Corda in Senftenbergia. In this case\r\nthe fructification is not unlike that of Aneimidictyon of the present\r\nday. Carruthers has recently detected the separate sporangia of Ferns\r\nfull of spores in calcareous nodules in coal (Plate I. Fig. 5). These\r\nhave the elastic ring characteristic of the Polypodiaceæ, and in\r\ntheir size, form, and method of attachment, they are allied to the\r\ngroup Hymenophylleæ. The absence of fructification presents a great\r\nobstacle to the determination of fossil Ferns. Circinate vernation,\r\nso common in modern Ferns, is rarely seen in the fossil species,\r\nand we do not in general meet with rhizomes. Characters taken from\r\nthe venation and forms of the fronds are not always to be depended\r\nupon, if we are to judge from the Ferns of the present day. There\r\nis a great similarity between the carboniferous Ferns of Britain\r\nand America; and the same species, or closely allied species of the\r\nsame genera as those found in Britain have been met with in South\r\nAfrica, South America, and Australia. In the English coal-measures\r\nthe species are about 140. The Palæozoic flora of the Arctic regions\r\nalso resembles that of the other quarters of the globe. Heer, in\r\nhis account of the fossil flora of Bear Island,[7] enumerates the\r\nfollowing plants:--Cardiopteris frondosa, C. polymorpha, Palæopteris\r\nRoemeriana, Sphenopteris Schimperi, Lepidodendron Veltheimianum, L.\r\ncommutatum, L. Carneggiannum, L. Wilkianum, Lepidophyllum Roemeri,\r\nKnorria imbricata, K. acicularis, Calamites radiatus, Cyclostigma\r\nKiltorkense, Stigmaria ficoides, etc., Cardiocarpum ursinum, C.\r\npunctulatum, besides various sporangia and spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22, _bis_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 22, _bis_. Adiantites Lindseæformis.]\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of Ferns over flowering plants is seen at the\r\npresent day in many tropical islands, such as St. Helena and the\r\nSociety group, as well as in extra-tropical islands, as New Zealand.\r\nIn the latter, Hooker picked 36 kinds in an area of a few acres;\r\nthey gave a luxuriant aspect to the vegetation, which presented\r\nscarcely twelve flowering plants and trees besides. An equal area\r\nin the neighbourhood of Sydney (in about the same latitude) would\r\nhave yielded upwards of 100 flowering plants, and only two or three\r\nFerns. This Acrogenous flora, then, seems to favour the idea of\r\na humid as well as mild and equable climate at the period of the\r\ncoal formation--the vegetation being that of islands in the midst\r\nof a vast ocean. Lesquereux, in Silliman's Journal, gives three\r\nsections of Ferns in the Carboniferous strata--viz. Neuropterideæ,\r\nPecopterideæ, and Sphenopterideæ. In Neuropterideæ fructification has\r\nbeen seen in Odontopteris. In this genus the spores are in a peculiar\r\nbladdery sporangium. In Neuropterideæ the fructification appears to\r\nhave resembled Danæa in some cases, and Osmunda in others. Professor\r\nGeikie has noticed in the lower Carboniferous shales of Slateford,\r\nnear Edinburgh, a fern which has been named Adiantites Lindseæformis\r\nby Bunbury (Fig. 22, _bis_). It has pinnules between crescent and\r\nfan shaped. (Mem. Geol. Survey of Edinburgh, 1861, p. 151.)\r\n\r\nAmong the Ferns found in the clays, ironstones, and sandstones of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, we shall give the characters of some\r\nby way of illustration.[8] Pecopteris (Fig. 23) seems to be the\r\nfossil representative, if not congener, of Pteris. Pecopteris\r\nheterophylla (Fig. 24) has a marked resemblance to Pteris\r\nesculenta of New Zealand. The frond of Pecopteris is pinnatifid,\r\nor bi-tri-pinnatifid--the leaflets adhering to the rachis by the\r\nwhole length of their base, sometimes confluent; the midrib of the\r\nleaflets runs to the point, and the veins come off from it nearly\r\nperpendicularly, and the fructification when present is at the end of\r\nthe veins. Neuropteris (Figs. 25, 26, 27) has a pinnate or bipinnate\r\nfrond, with pinnæ somewhat cordate at the base--the midrib of the\r\npinnæ vanishing towards the apex, and the veins coming off obliquely,\r\nand in an arched manner. Neuropteris gigantea (Fig. 26) has a thick\r\nbare rachis, according to Miller, and seems to resemble much Osmunda\r\nregalis. Odontopteris has leaves like the last, but its leaflets\r\nadhere to the stalk by their whole base, the veins spring from the\r\nbase of the leaflets, and pass on towards the point. Sphenopteris\r\n(Fig. 28) has a twice or thrice pinnatifid frond, the leaflets being\r\nnarrowed at the base, often wedge-shaped, and the veins generally\r\narranged as if they radiated from the base. Sphenopteris elegans\r\nresembled Pteris aquilina in having a stout leafless rachis, which\r\ndivided at a height of seven or eight inches from its club-like base\r\ninto two equal parts, each of which continued to undergo two or three\r\nsuccessive bifurcations. A little below the first forking two divided\r\npinnæ were sent off. A very complete specimen, with the stipe, was\r\ncollected in the coalfield near Edinburgh by Hugh Miller, who has\r\ndescribed it as above. Lonchopteris has its frond multi-pinnatifid,\r\nand the leaflets more or less united together at the base; there is a\r\ndistinct midrib, and the veins are reticulated. Cyclopteris (Fig. 29)\r\nhas simple orbicular leaflets, undivided or lobed at the margin, the\r\nveins radiating from the base, with no midrib. Schizopteris resembles\r\nthe last, but the frond is deeply divided into numerous unequal\r\nsegments, which are usually lobed and taper-pointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23-29.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 23 to 29 exhibit the fronds of some of the Ferns\r\nof the Carboniferous epoch.

Fig. 32. _Caulopteris Morrisi_ (Carr.),\r\nCoal-measures.]\r\n\r\nThe rarity of Tree-ferns in the coal-measures has often been\r\nobserved, and it is the more remarkable from the durable nature of\r\ntheir tissues. Several species have, however, been noticed. They\r\nare referred to the genus Caulopteris. One of them, C. macrodiscus\r\n(Fig. 30) has the leaf-scars in linear series. Two other species are\r\nfigured, the one a slender form with the scars widely separated,\r\nas in some Alsophilas, C. Balfouri (Fig. 31) from the Somersetshire\r\ncoal-field; and the other with larger stems and more closely\r\naggregated scars, C. Morrisi (Fig. 32), from the coal-measures at\r\nNewcastle. The latter species shows the cavities at the base of the\r\npetiole described by Mohl in many living fern-stems. The fossils\r\nnamed Psaronius appear to have been fern-stems with a slender axis\r\nand a large mass of adventitious roots, as in some Dicksonias and\r\nin Osmunda regalis. These stems probably belong to some of the\r\nfronds to which other names are given, but as they have not been\r\nfound attached, it is impossible to determine the point. Miller has\r\ndescribed a fern as occurring in the coal-measures, which at first\r\nsight presents more the appearance of a Cycadaceous frond than\r\nany other vegetable organism of the carboniferous age except the\r\nCycadites Caledonicus (Salter), from Cockburnspath Cove. He thus\r\ndescribes it:--\r\n\r\n\"From a stipe about a line in thickness there proceed at right\r\nangles, and in alternate order, a series of sessile lanceolate\r\nleaflets, rather more than two inches in length, by about an eighth\r\npart of an inch in breadth, and about three lines apart. Each is\r\nfurnished with a slender midrib; and, what seems a singular, though\r\nnot entirely unique feature in a Fern, the edges of each are densely\r\nhirsute, and bristle with thick short hair. The venation is not\r\ndistinctly preserved.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33-34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36-37.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 33 to 37 exhibit forms of Sigillaria stems found in\r\nthe shales of the Carboniferous epoch.

Fig. 37. _Sigillaria pachyderma_; the stem marked with\r\nscars, and fluted longitudinally.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nSigillaria (Plate IV. Figs. 1 and 2) is perhaps the most important\r\nplant in the coal formation. The name is derived from sigillum, a\r\nseal, to indicate the seal-like markings in the stem. It is found\r\nin all coal-shales over the world. Schimper mentions 83 species. It\r\noccurs in the form of lofty stems, 40-50 feet high, and 5 feet broad\r\n(Figs. 33 and 34). Many stems of Sigillaria may be seen near Morpeth,\r\nstanding erect at right angles to the planes of alternating strata\r\nof shale and sandstone (Fig. 33). They vary from 10 to 20 feet in\r\nheight, and from one to three feet in diameter. Sir W. C. Trevelyan\r\ncounted 20 portions of these trees within the length of half-a-mile,\r\nof which all but four or five were upright. Brongniart mentions\r\nsimilar erect stems as being found near St. Etienne. The stem of\r\nSigillaria is fluted in a longitudinal manner, like a Doric column,\r\nand has a succession of single scars, which indicate the points\r\nof insertion of the leaves (Figs. 35, 36, and 37). When the outer\r\npart of the stem separates like bark, it is found that the markings\r\npresented by the inner surface differ from those seen externally.\r\nThis has sometimes given rise to the erroneous multiplication of\r\nspecies and even of genera. Sigillaria elegans, as figured by\r\nBrongniart in Archives du Museum, i. 405, has a stem consisting of a\r\ncentral cellular axis or medulla, surrounded by a vascular cylinder,\r\nand this is invested by a thick cellular cortical layer, the outer\r\nportion composed of fusiform cells of less diameter than those of\r\nthe inner portion. What Brongniart calls medullary rays are mere\r\ncracks or separations in the wedges traversed by vessels. In its\r\nstructure it resembles its root Stigmaria, and must be referred to\r\nLycopodiaceæ, along with Lepidodendron, Halonia, Ulodendron, etc. The\r\nsmall round sporangia of Sigillaria are borne in a single patch on\r\nthe somewhat enlarged bases of some of the leaves. (See Carruthers\r\non Structure and Affinities of Sigillaria, in Journ. Geol. Soc. Aug.\r\n1869.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38-39.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 38. _Stigmaria ficoides_, root of Sigillaria, giving\r\noff rootlets, which have been compressed.\r\n\r\nFig. 39. _Stigmaria ficoides_ (_S. Anabathra_ of Corda),\r\nwhich is the root of a Sigillaria. The markings are the points whence\r\nrootlets proceed.]\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by Professor King and Mr. Binney of\r\nManchester, that the plant called Stigmaria (Fig. 38) is not a\r\nseparate genus, but the root of Sigillaria (Plate IV. Figs. 1\r\nand 2). The name is derived from στίγμα, a mark, indicating the\r\nmarkings on the axis. It is one of the most common productions of the\r\ncoal-measures, and consists of long rounded or compressed fragments,\r\nmarked externally by shallow circular, oblong, or lanceolate\r\ncavities (Fig. 39) in the centre of slight tubercles, arranged more\r\nor less regularly in a quincuncial manner (Plate III. Fig. 7). The\r\ncavities occasionally present a radiating appearance. The axis of\r\nthe fragments is often hollow, and different in texture from the\r\nparts around. This axis consists of a vascular cylinder or woody\r\nsystem, penetrated by quincuncially arranged meshes or openings,\r\nthrough which the vascular bundles proceed from the inner surface\r\nof the cylinder to the rootlets (Plate III. Figs. 8 and 9). From\r\nthe scars and tubercles arise long ribbon-shaped processes, which\r\nwere cylindrical cellular roots, now compressed (Fig. 38). The\r\nvascular cylinder of Stigmaria is composed entirely of scalariform\r\ntissue, pierced by meshes for the passage, from the inner surface\r\nof the cylinder, of the vascular bundles which supply the rootlets.\r\n(Carruthers in Geol. Proc., Aug. 1869.) Stigmaria ficoides (Fig.\r\n38) abounds in the under-clay of a coal-seam, sending out numerous\r\nroots from its tubercles, and pushing up its aerial stem, in the form\r\nof a fluted Sigillaria. On the Bolton and Manchester Railway Mr.\r\nBinney discovered Sigillarias standing erect, and evidently connected\r\nwith Stigmarias which extended 20 feet or more.[9] Stigmaria is\r\nregarded by Schimper as roots, not of Sigillaria only, but of\r\nKnorria longifolia (one of the Lepidodendreæ). The base of the stem\r\nof this species of Knorria is Ancestrophyllum, and the upper part\r\nis Didymophyllum Schottini of Goeppert. Professor King and others\r\nsuppose that the Fern-like frond called Neuropteris is connected with\r\nSigillaria, but this is a mere conjecture, set aside by the discovery\r\nof leaves attached to a species allied to Sigillaria elegans, which\r\nestablishes that the long linear leaves described under the name\r\nCyperites are the foliage of this genus. Goldenberg has figured the\r\nfructification, which consists of small sporangia like those of\r\nFlemingites, borne on the basis of but slightly modified leaves.\r\nThis establishes the opinion that Sigillaria was an acrogenous plant\r\nbelonging to Lycopodiaceæ. Brongniart reckons it as representing an\r\nextinct form of Gymnosperms, and King, having erroneously associated\r\nthe Cyclopteris with it, places it between the Ferns and Cycadaceæ.\r\nMr. Carruthers informs me that he has examined the stem of a true\r\nfluted Sigillaria, with the tissues preserved, and that these agree\r\nwith the structure of Lepidodendron, a position in which he had\r\nalready placed it from the structure of its fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40-41.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 40 to 44 exhibit the stems and fructification of\r\nLepidodendron.

Scales and\r\nsporangia of a cone of Flemingites.[10]]\r\n\r\nLepidodendron (Figs. 40 to 44) is another genus of the coal-measures\r\nwhich differs from those of the present day (Plate IV. Fig. 3).\r\nLepidodendrons, or fossil Lycopodiaceæ, had spikes of fructification\r\ncomparable in size to the cones of firs and cedars, and containing\r\nvery large sporangia, even larger than those of Isoetes, to which\r\nthey approach in form and structure. Schimper, in 1870, enumerates\r\n56 species of Lepidodendron, all arborescent and carboniferous.\r\nThe stem of a Lepidodendron is from 20 to 45 feet high, marked\r\noutside by peculiar scale-like scars (Fig. 41), hence the name of\r\nthe plant (λεπίς, a scale, and δένδρον, a tree). Although the scars\r\non Lepidodendron are usually flattened, yet in some species they\r\noccupy the faces of diamond-shaped projections, elevated one-sixth\r\nof an inch or more above the surface of the stem, and separated from\r\neach other by deep furrows;--the surface bearing the leaf being\r\nperforated by a tubular cavity, through which the bundle of vessels\r\nthat diverged from the vascular axis of the stem to the leaf passed\r\nout. The linear or lanceolate leaves are arranged in the same way as\r\nthose of Lycopodiums or of Coniferæ, and the branches fork like the\r\nformer. The internal structure of the stem is the same as that of\r\nSigillaria. The fruit of Lepidodendron and allied genera is seen in\r\nLepidostrobus and Triplosporites (Figs. 42, 43; Plate III, Fig. 10).\r\nCarruthers, in his lecture to the Royal Institution, in describing\r\nthe forms of Lepidostrobus, says--\"The fruit is a cone composed\r\nof imbricated scales arranged spirally on the axis like the true\r\nleaves, and bearing the sporangia on their horizontal pedicels. Three\r\ndifferent forms of fruit belong to this genus, or it should perhaps\r\nrather be called group of plants. The first of these is the cone\r\nnamed by Robert Brown Triplosporites (Figs. 42, 43), and described by\r\nhim from an exquisitely preserved specimen of an upper portion, in\r\nwhich the parts are exhibited as clearly in the petrified condition\r\nas if they belonged to a fresh and living plant. The large sporangia\r\nhave a double wall, the outer composed of a compact layer of oblong\r\ncells placed endwise, or with the long diameter perpendicular to the\r\nsurface; the inner is a delicate cellular membrane. The sporangium\r\nis filled with a great number of very small spores, each composed of\r\nthree roundish bodies or sporules. Recently Brongniart and Schimper\r\nhave described a complete specimen of this fruit, in which the minute\r\ntriple spores are confined to the sporangia of the upper and middle\r\npart of the cone, but the lower portion, which was wanting in Brown's\r\nspecimen, bears sporangia filled with simple spherical spores ten or\r\ntwelve times larger than the others (woodcut 44, 9).\r\n\r\n\"The structure of another form of cone (Lepidostrobus) has been\r\nexpounded by Dr. Hooker. The arrangement of the different parts\r\ncomprising it is precisely similar to what occurs in Triplosporites;\r\nbut the sporangia are filled with the minute triple spores throughout\r\nthe whole cone (woodcut 44, 6 and 8).\r\n\r\n\"The third form of cone, described by me under the name Flemingites,\r\ndiffers from the other two in having a large number of small\r\nsporangia supported on the surface of each scale; and it agrees with\r\nLepidostrobus in the sporangia containing only small spores (woodcut\r\n44, 10).\r\n\r\n\"In comparing these fossils with the living club-mosses, one is\r\nstruck with the singular agreement in the organisation of plants so\r\nfar removed in time, and so different in size, as the recent humble\r\nclub-mosses and the palæozoic tree Lepidodendrons. The fruit of\r\nTriplosporites, like that of Selaginella (woodcut 44, 1), contains\r\nlarge and small spores, the microspores being found in both genera on\r\nthe middle and upper scales of the cone, and the macrospores on those\r\nof the lower portion (Fig. 43).\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the fruits of Lepidostrobus and Flemingites\r\nagree with that of Lycopodium in having only microspores. The size\r\nof the two kinds of spores also singularly agrees in the two groups.\r\nThis is of some importance, for among the recent vascular Cryptogams\r\nthere is a remarkable uniformity in the size of the spores in the\r\nmembers of the different groups, even when there is a great variety\r\nin the size of the plants. Thus the spore of our humble wall-rue\r\nis as large as that of the giant Alsophila of tropical regions. So\r\nalso the spores of Equisetum and Calamites agree in size, as may be\r\nseen in woodcut 47, Figs. 3, 4, and 9, where the spores of the two\r\ngenera are magnified to the same extent. And a similar comparison\r\nof the macrospore and microspore of Triplosporites with those of\r\nSelaginella, and of the microspore of Lepidostrobus with that of\r\nLycopodium, exhibits a similar agreement. This is made apparent by\r\nthe drawings in woodcut 44 of the two kinds of spores of Selaginella,\r\n3 and 4, with those of Triplosporites, 8 and 9, which are drawn to\r\nthe same scale.\"\r\n\r\nThe genus Sigillaria, as we have already said, has, according to the\r\nobservation of Hooker, small sporangia exactly agreeing in size and\r\nform with those of Flemingites. Most probably the contents of these\r\nsmall sporangia were the same in both genera, so that Sigillaria\r\nwould be placed with Flemingites and Lepidostrobus as arborescent\r\nLycopodiaceæ having their affinities with Lycopodium, as they have\r\nall microspores only in their fructification.\r\n\r\nThe scales upon the Lepidodendron stems, as well as those in the\r\ncones, are arranged in a spiral manner, in the same way as plants\r\nof the present day. Professor Alexander Dickson has examined the\r\nphyllotaxis of Lepidodendrons, and gives the following results of his\r\nobservations (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edin. xi. 145). The fossil remains\r\nof Lepidodendrons are often so compressed that it is difficult,\r\nor even impossible, to trace the secondary spirals round the\r\ncircumference of the stem. In those cases, however, where there is\r\ncomparatively little compression, _i.e._ where the stem is more or\r\nless cylindrical, the determination of the phyllotaxis is easy. Of\r\nsuch stems he has examined fifteen specimens, which may be classed\r\naccording to the series of spirals to which the leaf-arrangement\r\nbelongs:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Ordinary series, ½, ⅓, ⅖, ⅜, 5/13, etc.\r\n\r\n  (a.) Single spirals (D turning to the right, S to the left).\r\n\r\n  (1.) _Lepidodendron_ (Possil Ironstone series). Stem about ¾\r\n  of an inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 8 D, 13 S, 21 D.\r\n  Divergence = 13/34 (or possibly 21/55).\r\n\r\n  (2.) _Lepidodendron_ (Knightswood, near Glasgow, Mr. J. Young).\r\n  Stem about 1½ inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 13 D, 21 S, 34\r\n  D. Divergence = 21/55.\r\n\r\n  (3.) _Lepidodendron_ (Possil Sandstone series). Trunk about\r\n  2 feet long, with an average diameter of 20 inches. Steepest\r\n  secondary spirals 55 S, 89 D. Divergence = 55/144.\r\n\r\n  (b.) Conjugate spirals.[11]\r\n\r\n  (4.) _Lepidostrobus ornatus_ (Bathgate coal-field). About ¾ of\r\n  an inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 10 D, 16 S, 26 D, 42 S.\r\n  Divergence = 13/(34×2) (Bijugate arrangement).\r\n\r\n  (5.) _Lepidostrobus_ (Plean, Stirlingshire, Mr. Mackenzie). About\r\n  ½ an inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 9 S, 15 D, 24 S, 39 D.\r\n  Divergence = 8/(21×3) (Trijugate arrangement).\r\n\r\n  (6.) _Knorria taxina_ (from collection of Dr. Rankin, Carluke).\r\n  Somewhat compressed, 2-2½ inches[12] in diameter. Secondary\r\n  spirals 15 D, 24 S. Divergence = 15/(13×3) (Trijugate\r\n  arrangement).\r\n\r\n  (7.) _Lepidodendron_ (from Dr. Rankin's collection). About 1¼\r\n  inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 10 D, 15 S, 25 D, 40 S.\r\n  Divergence = 5/(13×5) (Quinquejugate arrangement).\r\n\r\n  (8.) _Lepidodendron_ (Dowanhill, Glasgow, Possil Sandstone\r\n  series). Trunk about 1 foot long, and 1 foot in diameter. The\r\n  upper portion exhibits secondary spirals 35 D, 56 S, 91 D; thus\r\n  indicating a 7-jugate arrangement, with divergence = 8/(21×7).\r\n  The arrangement on the middle and lower portion is indistinct\r\n  and confused; so much so as to render any determination of the\r\n  arrangement doubtful.\r\n\r\nB. Series, ⅓, ¼, 2/7, 3/11, etc.\r\n\r\n  (9.) _Lepidodendron_ (Messrs Merry and Cunningham's Clayband\r\n  Iron-Pit, Carluke). Stem 2 inches in diameter. Secondary spirals\r\n  18 S, 29 D, 47 S. Divergence = 21/76.\r\n\r\nC. Series, ¼, ⅕, 2/9, 3/14, etc.\r\n\r\n  (10.) _Lepidodendron_ (R. B. Garden, Edinburgh, Museum). Stem\r\n  somewhat flattened, 1-1½ inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 9 D,\r\n  14 S, 23 D, 37 S. Divergence = 13/60.\r\n\r\n  (11.) _Lepidodendron_ (Redhaugh, near Edinburgh, Mr. Peach). Stem\r\n  somewhat flattened, ¾ to ½ inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 9\r\n  S, 14 D, 23 S, 37 D. Divergence = 13/60.\r\n\r\nD. Series, ⅕, ⅙, 2/11, 3/17, 5/28, etc.\r\n\r\n  (12.) _Knorria taxina_ (Stockbriggs, Lesmahagow,--Hunterian\r\n  Museum). About 1 inch in diameter. The specimen consists of a\r\n  main stem and one of the branches into which it has forked.\r\n  On the main stem the secondary spirals are 6 D, 11 S, 17 D.\r\n  Divergence = 5/28 (series, ⅕, ⅙, 2/11, 3/17, 5/28, etc.)--On the\r\n  branch the secondary spirals are 8 S, 13 D. Divergence = 8/21\r\n  (ordinary series, ½, ⅓, ⅖, ⅜, etc.)\r\n\r\nE. Series, ½, ⅖, 3/7, 5/12, 8/19, 13/31, 21/50, etc.\r\n\r\n  (13.) _Lepidodendron_ (from Dr. Rankin's collection). About ⅞\r\n  inch in diameter. Secondary spirals 12 D, 19 S, 31 D. Divergence\r\n  = 21/50.\r\n\r\nF. Series, ⅓, 3/10, 4/13, 7/23, 11/36, 18/59, etc.\r\n\r\n  (14.) _Lepidodendron elegans_ (Possil Ironstone). About 1¼ inch\r\n  in diameter. Secondary spirals 10 S, 13 D, 23 S, 36 D. Divergence\r\n  = 18/59.\r\n\r\n  (15.) _Lepidodendron_ (Possil Ironstone). About 2¼ inches in\r\n  diameter. Secondary spirals 23 S, 36 D, 59 S, 95 D. Divergence =\r\n  47/154.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is evident that the phyllotaxis of Lepidodendron\r\nis extremely variable, as much so perhaps as that of those most\r\nvariable plants, in this respect, the Cacti. It is also clear that\r\nwhat has been enunciated by Professor Haughton (Manual of Geology,\r\nLond. 1866, pp. 243, 245) as the law according to which the leaves of\r\npalæozoic plants were arranged--viz. that of alternate whorls--does\r\nnot apply to these ancient Lycopods. Lepidodendron aculeatum is noted\r\nby Naumann as exhibiting an 8/21 arrangement. (Poggendorff, Annalen,\r\n1842, p. 5.) Professor Alexander Braun (Nov. Acta Ac. C. L. C. xv.\r\n1, pp. 558-9), speaking of the excessive deviation from ordinary\r\narrangements in Equisetaceæ (including Calamites), compares them in\r\nthis respect with Lycopodiaceæ (including Lepidodendron), saying\r\nthat in these two families \"the utmost limits of the domain of all\r\nleaf-arrangement appears to be attained.\"\r\n\r\nLepidophyllum is certainly leaves of Lepidodendron, the different\r\nLepidophylla belonging to different species of the genus. The slender\r\nterminal branches are noticed under the name of Lycopodites. In coal\r\nfrom Fordel Mr. Daw has detected innumerable bodies (Plate III.\r\nFigs. 1, 2, 3) which have been shown to be sporangia. (Balfour,\r\nTrans. Roy. Soc. Ed. xxi. 187.) On their under surface Mr. Carruthers\r\nhas observed a triradiate ridge (Plate III. Fig. 4). (Geological\r\nMagazine, 1865, vol. ii. p. 140.) These sporangia have been found\r\nconnected with the cone-like fructification called Flemingites, and\r\nresembling Lycopodium (woodcut 44, Fig. 4). Many forms of fossil\r\nplants, such as Halonia, Lepidophloios, Knorria, and Ulodendron,\r\nbelong to the Lepidodendron group. Knorria is said to be the internal\r\ncast of a Lepidodendron.\r\n\r\nUlodendron minus and U. Taylori (Plate III. Fig. 11), found in\r\nferruginous shale in the Water of Leith, near Colinton, exhibit\r\nbeautiful sculptured scars, ranged rectilinearly along the stem.\r\nThe surface is covered with small, sharply relieved obovate scales,\r\nmost of them furnished with an apparent midrib, and with their edges\r\nslightly turned up. The circular or oval scars of this genus are\r\nprobably impressions made by a rectilinear range of aerial roots\r\nplaced on either side. When decorticated, the stem is mottled over\r\nwith minute dottings arranged in a quincuncial manner, and its oval\r\nscars are devoid of the ordinary sculpturings. Bothrodendron is a\r\ndecorticated condition of Ulodendron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45 _a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45 _b_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 45. _a_, _Calamites Suckovii_, composed of jointed\r\nstriated fragments having a bark. Fig. 45. _b_, Septum or phragma of\r\na Calamite.]\r\n\r\nCalamites (κάλαμος, a reed) is a reed-like fossil, having a\r\nsub-cylindrical jointed stem (Fig. 45, _a_ and _b_; Fig. 46; Plate\r\nIV. Fig. 4). The stem is often crushed and flattened, and was\r\noriginally hollow. Calamites is thus defined by Grand d'Eury (Ann.\r\nNat. Hist. ser. 4, vol. iv. p. 124):--Stem articulated, fistular, and\r\nseptate; outer part comparatively thin, formed of three concentric\r\nzones--1, an exterior cortical layer now converted into coal; 2, a\r\nthin subjacent zone of vascular tissue, now invariably destroyed;\r\n3, a sort of inner lining epidermis, which is carbonified. Cortical\r\nenvelope marked interiorly with regular flutings, interrupted and\r\nalternate at the articulations. Inner epidermis smooth, or scarcely\r\nstriated. Vascular cylinder thin; outer surface of bark more fully\r\nfluted and articulated than the inner surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 46. Vertical stems of fossil trees, Calamites\r\nchiefly, found in the coal-measures of Treuil, near Saint Etienne.]\r\n\r\nCarruthers gives the following description of the structure of a\r\nspecies of Calamite which he examined:--The stem was composed of a\r\ncentral medulla, which disappeared with the growth of the plant,\r\nsurrounded by a woody cylinder, composed entirely of scalariform\r\nvessels, and a thin cortical layer. The medulla penetrated the\r\nwoody cylinder by a series of regular wedges, which were continued,\r\nas delicate laminæ of one or two cells in thickness, to the\r\ncortical layer. The cells of those laminæ were not muriform; their\r\nlongest diameter was in the direction of the axis. The wedges were\r\ncontinuous, and parallel between each node. As the axial appendages\r\nwere produced in whorls, the only interference with the regularity of\r\nthe tissues was by the passing out through the stem at the nodes of\r\nthe vascular bundles which supplied these appendages. As the leaves\r\nof each whorl were (with one or two exceptions) opposite to the\r\ninterspaces of the whorls above and below, there was also at each\r\nnode a re-arrangement of the wedges of vascular and cellular tissues.\r\n\r\nSchimper considers Calamites as having an analogy with Equisetum in\r\nits fructification. He looks on them as fossil Equisetaceæ. Annularia\r\nand Sphenophyllum are considered as establishing a passage from the\r\nEquisetaceæ to the Lycopodiaceæ. Some gigantic fossil Equiseta had\r\na diameter of nearly 5 inches, and a height of 30 or more feet. The\r\nbranches, which adorned the higher part of them in the form of a\r\ncrown, are simple, and have at their extremity a spike of the size\r\nof a pigeon's egg, and organised exactly like the spikes of living\r\nEquiseta. The subterranean rhizomes are well developed, and gave\r\norigin, like many Equiseta, to tubercles which had the form and size\r\nof a hen's egg.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Equisetum of the present day and Calamites, are\r\nexhibited in woodcut 47. They show a marked resemblance in the\r\nfructification. (See also page 31.)\r\n\r\nPlants of Calamites have been seen erect by Mr. Binney, and he has\r\ndetermined that what were called leaves or branches by some are\r\nin reality roots. Mr. Binney gives a full description of various\r\nCalamites, under the name of Calamodendron commune, in his Memoir\r\npublished by the Palæontographical Society, 1868. There are between\r\n50 and 60 species recorded.[13]\r\n\r\nIn Spitzbergen, in rocks of the Carboniferous epoch, there have been\r\nfound Calamites, Sigillaria, Lepidodendron, and ferns, apparently the\r\nsame as those found in the Carboniferous epoch in Europe--Calamites\r\nradiatus, Lepidodendron Veltheimianum, Sigillaria distans, Stigmaria\r\nficoides. Some species--Sigillaria Malmgreni, Lepidodendron\r\nCarneggiannum, and L. Wilkianum--seem to be peculiar to Bear Island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 47.

Transverse section of cone.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Carruthers the Equisetaceæ are represented in Britain by\r\nthe two genera Calamites found in primary beds, and Equisetum found\r\nin secondary rocks and living at the present day. The difference in\r\nthe structure of their fruits is shown in woodcut 47. The fruit of\r\nCalamites, called Volkmannia Binneyi (woodcut 47, 7), is a small\r\nslender cone composed of alternating whorls of imbricate scales,\r\ntwelve in each verticil. The scales completely conceal the leaves\r\nconnected with the fructification. The fruit-bearing leaves are\r\nstalked, peltate, and are arranged in whorls of 6. There are four\r\nsporangia borne on the under-surface of the peltate leaves. These\r\nspore-cases have cellular parietes, and in their interior there is\r\na deposit of cellulose in the form of short truncate processes not\r\nunlike imperfect spirals. The spores are spherical, and appear to\r\nhave thread-like processes proceeding from them, similar to elaters.\r\nThe fruit-cone bears a marked resemblance to the fruit of Equisetum\r\nin its fruit-bearing leaves, sporangia, spores, and elaters (see\r\nFigs. 18, 19, 20, 21). In the modern plant all the leaves of the cone\r\nare fructiferous, while in the fossil plant some are fruit-bearing,\r\nand others are like the ordinary leaves of the plant. It is thought\r\nthat the fossil may be reckoned as having a somewhat higher position\r\nthan that possessed by the living genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 48. Foliage and fruits of Calamites. 1 and 2.\r\nAsterophyllites; 3 and 4. Annularia; 5 and 6. Sphenophyllum.]\r\n\r\nThe different forms of foliage called Asterophyllites, Sphenophyllum,\r\nand Annularia, belong to the one genus Calamites, but they may form,\r\nperhaps, well-characterised sections when their fruits are better\r\nknown. In woodcut 48 representations are given of the foliage and\r\nfruit of varieties of Calamites. In 1 and 2 we see the simplest form\r\ncalled Asterophyllites. The leaves are linear and slender, with a\r\nsingle rib. The form called Annularia (3 and 4) differs chiefly\r\nin having a larger amount of cellular tissue spread out on either\r\nside of the midrib. This form has a different aspect in a fossil\r\nstate from the other, from its whorls of numerous broad leaves\r\nspread out on the surface of deposition, while the acicular leaves\r\nof Asterophyllites have penetrated the soft mud, and are generally\r\npreserved in the position they originally occupied in reference\r\nto the supporting branch. The third form (5 and 6) is called\r\nSphenophyllum, and consists of whorls of wedge-shaped leaves, with\r\none or more bifurcating veins. They occur like those of Annularia,\r\nspread out on the surface of the shale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49-50.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 49. _Araucarioxylon Withami_, Krauss (_Pinites\r\nWithami_), from the Coal-measures, Craigleith, near Edinburgh,\r\nshowing pleurenchyma with disks, and medullary rays. An excellent\r\nspecimen of a stem of this pine may be seen in the Edinburgh Royal\r\nBotanic Garden.\r\n\r\nFig. 50. _Trigonocarpum olivæforme_, an ovate, acuminate,\r\nthree-ribbed, and striated fruit or seed, which some suppose to be a\r\nsporangium of a Lepidodendron, others refer it to Cycadaceæ. Hooker\r\nrefers it to Coniferæ like Salisburia.]\r\n\r\nTrue Exogenous trees exist in the coal-fields both of\r\nEngland and Scotland, as at Lennel Braes and Allan Bank, in\r\nBerwickshire; High-Heworth, Fellon, Gateshead, and Wideopen, near\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne; and in quarries to the west of Durham; also in\r\nCraigleith quarry, near Edinburgh, and in the quarry at Granton, now\r\nunder water. In the latter localities they lay diagonally athwart\r\nthe sandstone strata, at an angle of about 30°, with the thicker and\r\nheavier part of their trunks below, like snags in the Mississippi.\r\nFrom their direction we infer that they have been drifted by a stream\r\nwhich has flowed from nearly north-east to south-west. At Granton,\r\none of the specimens exhibited roots. In other places the specimens\r\nare portions of stems, one of them 6 feet in diameter by 61 feet in\r\nlength, and another 4 feet in diameter by 70 feet in length. These\r\nExogenous trees are Gymnosperms, having woody tissue like that of\r\nConiferæ. We see under the microscope punctated woody tissue, the\r\nrows of disks being usually two, three, or more, and alternating.\r\nThey seem to be allied in these respects to Araucaria and Eutassa\r\n(Fig. 61, p. 74) of the present flora. Araucarioxylon or Pinites\r\nWithami (Fig. 49) is one of the species found in Craigleith quarry;\r\nthe concentric layers of the wood are obsolete; there are 2, 3, or\r\n4 rows of disks on the wood, and 2-4 rows of small cells in the\r\nmedullary rays. Along with it there have also been found Dadoxylon\r\nmedullare, with inconspicuous zones, 2, 3, and 4 rows of disks, and\r\n2-5 series of rows of cells in the rays. Pissadendron antiquum (Pitus\r\nantiqua) having 4-5 series of cells in the medullary rays, and P.\r\nprimævum (Pitus primæva), with 10-15 series of cells in the medullary\r\nrays, occur at Tweedmill and Lennel Braes in Berwickshire; Peuce\r\nWithami (Fig. 1, p. 3) at Hilltop, near Durham, and at Craigleith.\r\nSternbergia is considered by Williamson as a Dadoxylon, with a\r\ndiscoid pith like that seen now-a-days in the Walnut, Jasmine, and\r\nCecropia peltata, as well as in some species of Euphorbia.[14]\r\nSternbergia approximata is named by him Dadoxylon approximatum.\r\nHooker believes from the structure of Trigonocarpum (Fig. 50) that it\r\nis a coniferous fruit nearly allied to Salisburia (Trans. Roy. Soc.\r\n1854). Several species of Trigonocarpum occur in the Carboniferous\r\nrocks, such as T. olivæforme from Bolton (Plate II. Fig. 5), and T.\r\nsulcatum from Wardie, near Edinburgh (Plate II. Fig. 6). Noeggerathia\r\nand a few other plants, such as Flabellaria and Artisia, are referred\r\nby Brongniart to Cycadaceæ. Flabellaria borassifolia, according\r\nto Peach, has leaves like Yucca. Noeggerathia has pinnate leaves,\r\ncuneiform leaflets, sometimes fan-shaped; the veins arise from the\r\nbase of the leaflets, are equal in size, and either remain simple or\r\nbifurcate, the nervation (venation) being similar to that of some\r\nZamias.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of this period, referred to as Antholithes,[15] have\r\njust been shown by Mr. Carruthers to be the inflorescence of\r\nCardiocarpum (Geol. Mag. Feb. 1872), and he proposes to set aside\r\nthe former name, confining it to the tertiary fossils to which it\r\nwas originally given by Brongniart, and to use the latter name.\r\nThe main axis of the inflorescence is simple, stout, and marked\r\nexternally with interrupted ridges. The axis bears in a distichous\r\nmanner sub-opposite or alternate bracts of a linear-lanceolate\r\nform and with decurrent bases. In the axils of the bracts were\r\ndeveloped flower-like leaf-bearing buds, and from them proceeded\r\nthree or four linear pedicels, which terminated upwards in a somewhat\r\nenlarged trumpet-shaped apex. To this enlarged articulating surface\r\nwas attached the fruit, to which has been given the generic name\r\nCardiocarpum[16] (Fig. 51). The place of attachment is indicated by\r\nthe short straight line which separates the cordate lobes at the base\r\nof the fruit. The fruit is flattish, broadly ovate, with a cordate\r\nbase and sub-acute apex. It consists of an outer pericarp, inclosing\r\nan ovate-acute seed. That the pericarp was of some thickness,\r\nand formed probably a sub-indurated rind, is shown by a specimen\r\npreserved in the round, and figured (Fig. 53 _a_). The pericarp is\r\nopen at the apex; and the elongated tubular apex of the spermoderm\r\npasses up to this opening. The seed forms a distinct swelling in the\r\ncentre of the fruit, and a slight ridge passes up the middle to the\r\nbase of the apical opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51-52.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 51. _Cardiocarpum Lindleyi_, Carr. Fig. 52. Do.,\r\nCoal-measures, Falkirk.]\r\n\r\nThese fossils are believed to be an extinct form of Gymnosperms. Two\r\nspecies have been described, of both of which we are able to give\r\nfigures. The first figure is from the specimens collected by Mr.\r\nPeach at Falkirk. It is Cardiocarpum Lindleyi (Figs. 51, 52); it has\r\na primary axis with sub-opposite axillary axes, bearing four to six\r\nlanceolate leaves and three or four pedicels. Primary bracts short\r\nand arcuate. Fruit ovate-cordate, with an acute bifid apex, and a\r\nridge passing up the middle of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 53. _Cardiocarpum anomalum_ (Carr.), natural size:\r\nwith separate fruit (_a_), twice natural size--Coal-measures,\r\nCoalbrookdale.]\r\n\r\nThe second species is Cardiocarpum anomalum (Fig. 53) from\r\nCoalbrookdale; it has a primary axis with alternate or sub-opposite\r\naxillary axes, slender and elongated, bearing many linear leaves, and\r\nseveral slender pedicels; primary bracts long, slender, and straight;\r\nfruits small, margined. The somewhat magnified separate fruit (_a_)\r\nshows the thickness of the pericarp and the enclosed seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 54. _Pothocites Grantoni_, Paterson. _a_, Spike\r\nnatural size; _b_, Portion of spike magnified; _c_, Perianth,\r\n4-cleft, magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn the bituminous shale at Granton, near Edinburgh, Dr. Robert\r\nPaterson discovered in 1840 a peculiar fossil plant, which he called\r\nPothocites Grantoni (Fig. 54, _a_). It is figured in the Transactions\r\nof the Edinburgh Botanical Society, vol. i. March 1840. It is a spike\r\ncovered by parallel rows of flowers (Fig. 54, _b_), each apparently\r\nwith a 4-cleft calyx (Fig. 54, _c_). It was supposed to be allied to\r\nPotamogeton or Pothos, more probably to the latter. In that case it\r\nmust be referred to the natural order Araceæ. The original specimen\r\nis deposited in the museum at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the real state of the vegetation of the earth\r\nwhen coal was formed must be very limited, when we reflect how\r\nseldom the fructification of coniferous trees has been met with\r\nin the coal-measures. A very doubtful fragment, supposed to be a\r\ncone, is given in Lindley and Hutton's work, under the title of\r\nPinus anthracina; but it is believed by Carruthers to be a fragment\r\nof a Lepidodendroid branch. Lyell never saw a fossil fir-cone of\r\nthe Carboniferous epoch, either in the rocks or museums of North\r\nAmerica or Europe. Bunbury never heard of any other example than\r\nthat noticed by Lindley and Hutton. Principal Dawson is disposed\r\nto think that the suberin of cork, of epidermis in general, and of\r\nspore-cases in particular, is a substance so rich in carbon that\r\nit is very near to coal, and so indestructible and impermeable to\r\nwater, that it contributes more largely than anything else to the\r\nmineral. Sir Charles Lyell remarks--\"To prevent ourselves, therefore,\r\nfrom hazarding false generalisations, we must ever bear in mind the\r\nextreme scantiness of our present information respecting the flora\r\nof that peculiar class of stations to which, in the Palæozoic era,\r\nthe coal-measures probably belonged. I have stated elsewhere my\r\nconviction that the plants which produced coal were not drifted from\r\na distance, but nearly all of them grew on the spot where they became\r\nfossil. They constituted the vegetation of low regions, chiefly the\r\ndeltas of large rivers, slightly elevated above the level of the sea,\r\nand liable to be submerged beneath the waters of an estuary or sea\r\nby the subsidence of the ground to the amount of a few feet. That\r\nthe areas where the carboniferous deposits accumulated were low,\r\nis proved not only by the occasional association of marine remains,\r\nbut by the enormous thickness of strata of shale and sandstone to\r\nwhich the seams of coal are subordinate. The coal-measures are often\r\nthousands of feet, and sometimes two or three miles, in vertical\r\nthickness, and they imply that for an indefinite number of ages a\r\ngreat body of water flowed continuously in one direction, carrying\r\ndown towards a given area the detritus of a large hydrographical\r\nbasin, draining some large islands or continents, on the margins of\r\nwhich the forests of the coal period grew. If this view be correct,\r\nwe can know little or nothing of the upland flora of the same era,\r\nstill less of the contemporaneous plants of the mountainous or alpine\r\nregions. If so, this fact may go far to account for the apparent\r\nmonotony of the vegetation, although its uniform character may\r\ndoubtless be in part owing to a greater uniformity of climate then\r\nprevailing throughout the globe. Mr. Bunbury has successfully pointed\r\nout that the peculiarity of the carboniferous climate consisted\r\nmore in the humidity of the atmosphere and the absence of cold, or\r\nrather the equable temperature preserved in the different seasons of\r\nthe year, than in its tropical heat; but we must still presume that\r\ncolder climates existed at higher elevations above the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe plants of the coal-measures are evidently terrestrial plants.\r\nBrongniart agrees with Lyell in thinking that the layers of coal have\r\nin general accumulated in the situation where the plants forming\r\nthem grew. The remains of these plants covered the soil in the same\r\nway as layers of peat, or the vegetable mould of great forests. In a\r\nfew instances, however, the plants may have been transported from a\r\ndistance, and drifted into basins. Phillips is disposed to think that\r\nthis was the general mode of formation of coal-basins. He is led to\r\nthis conclusion by observing the fragmentary state of the stems and\r\nbranches, the general absence of roots, and the scattered condition\r\nof all the separable organs. Those who support the drift theory, look\r\non the coal plants as having been swept from the land on which they\r\ngrew by watery currents at different times, and deposited in basins\r\nand large sea-estuaries, and sometimes in lakes. The snags in the\r\nMississippi, the St. Lawrence, and other large rivers, are given as\r\ninstances of a similar drifting process.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the coal epoch seems to resemble most that of\r\nislands in the midst of vast oceans, and the prevalence of ferns\r\nindicates a climate similar to that of New Zealand in the present\r\nday. In speaking of the island vegetation of the coal epoch,\r\nProfessor Ansted remarks (Ancient World, p. 88)--\"The whole of the\r\ninterior of the islands may have been clothed with thick forests,\r\nthe dark verdure of which would only be interrupted by the bright\r\ngreen of the swamps in the hollows, or the brown tint of the ferns\r\ncovering some districts near the coasts. The forests may have been\r\nformed by a mixture of several different trees. We would see then,\r\nfor instance, the lofty and widely-spreading Lepidodendron, its\r\ndelicate feathery fronds clothing, in rich luxuriance, branches\r\nand stems, which are built up, like the trunk of the tree-fern, by\r\nsuccessive leafstalks that have one after another dropped away,\r\ngiving by their decay additional height to the stem, which might at\r\nlength be mistaken for that of a gigantic pine. There also should we\r\nfind the Sigillaria, its tapering and elegant form sustained on a\r\nlarge and firm basis--enormous matted roots, almost as large as the\r\ntrunk itself, being given off in every direction, and shooting out\r\ntheir fibres far into the sand and clay in search of moisture. The\r\nstem of this tree would appear like a fluted column, rising simply\r\nand gracefully without branches to a great height, and then spreading\r\nout a magnificent head of leaves like a noble palm-tree. Other trees,\r\nmore or less resembling palms, and others like existing firs, also\r\nabounded, giving a richness and variety to the scene; while one\r\ngigantic species, strikingly resembling the Norfolk Island pine,\r\nmight be seen towering a hundred feet or more above the rest of the\r\nforest, and exhibiting tier after tier of branches richly clothed\r\nwith its peculiar pointed spear-like leaves, the branches gradually\r\ndiminishing in size as they approach the apex of a lofty pyramid of\r\nvegetation. Tree-ferns also in abundance might there be recognised,\r\noccupying a prominent place in the physiognomy of vegetation,\r\nand dotted at intervals over the distant plains and valleys, the\r\nintermediate spaces being clothed with low vegetation of more humble\r\nplants of the same kind. These we may imagine exhibiting their rich\r\ncrests of numerous fronds, each many feet in length, and produced\r\nin such quantity as to rival even the palm-trees in beauty. Besides\r\nall these, other lofty trees of that day, whose stems and branches\r\nare now called Calamites, existed chiefly in the midst of swamps,\r\nand bore their singular branches and leaves aloft with strange and\r\nmonotonous uniformity. All these trees, and many others that might\r\nbe associated with them, were, perhaps, girt round with innumerable\r\ncreepers and parasitic plants, climbing to the topmost branches of\r\nthe most lofty amongst them, and relieving, in some measure, the dark\r\nand gloomy character of the great masses of vegetation.\"\r\n\r\nHugh Miller remarks--\"The sculpturesque character of the nobly-fluted\r\nSigillarias was shared by not a few of its contemporaries.\r\nUlodendrons, with their rectilinear rows of circular scars, and\r\ntheir stems covered with leaf-like carvings, rivalled in effect the\r\nornately relieved torus of a Corinthian column. Favularia, Halonia,\r\nmany of the Calamites, and all the Lepidodendrons, exhibited the most\r\ndelicate sculpturing. In walking among the ruins of this ancient\r\nflora, the palæontologist almost feels as if he had got among the\r\nbroken fragments of Italian palaces erected long years ago, when\r\nthe architecture of Rome was most ornate, and every moulding was\r\nroughened with ornament; and in attempting to call up in fancy the\r\nold Carboniferous forests, he has to dwell on this peculiar feature\r\nas one of the most prominent; and to see in the multitude of trunks\r\ndarkened above by clouds of foliage that rise upon him in the\r\nprospect, the slender columns of an older Alhambra, roughened with\r\narabesque tracery and exquisite filigree work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE PERMIAN EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55-56.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 55 and 56. _Walchia piniformis_, Sternb., a common\r\nspecies in the Permian rocks of Europe. Fig. 55. Plant with leaves\r\nand fructification. Fig. 56. Fructification, natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the vegetation during the Permian period, which is\r\nassociated with the Carboniferous, under the reign of Acrogens, has\r\nbeen extensively illustrated by Goeppert. Brongniart has enumerated\r\nthe fossils in three different localities, which he refers doubtfully\r\nto this period. 1. The flora of the bituminous slates of Thuringia,\r\ncomposed of Algæ, Ferns, and Coniferæ. 2. Flora of the Permian\r\nsandstones of Russia, comprehending Ferns, Equisetaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ,\r\nand Noeggerathiæ. 3. Flora of the slaty schists of Lodève, composed\r\nof Ferns, Asterophyllites, and Coniferæ. The genera of Ferns here met\r\nwith are those found in the Carboniferous epoch; the Gymnosperms are\r\nchiefly species of Walchia and Noeggerathia (the latter is supposed\r\nby Schimper to be a Cycad); Lepidodendron elongatum, Calamites gigas,\r\nand Annularia floribunda, are also species of this period. Walchia\r\nis a conifer characteristic of the Permian epoch, of which there are\r\neight species described (Figs. 55 and 56). It has a single seed to\r\neach scale of the cone, and two kinds of leaves, the one short and\r\nimbricated, the other long and spreading. Among the plants of the\r\nPermian formation Goeppert enumerates the following:[17]--Equisetites\r\ncontractus, Calamites Suckowi, C. leioderma, Asterophyllites\r\nequisetiformis, A. elatior, Huttonia truncata, H. equisetiformis,\r\nmany species of Psaronius, one of the filicoid plants,\r\nHymenophyllites complanatus, Sphenopteris crassinervia, Sagenopteris\r\ntæniæfolia, Neuropteris imbricata, and many other species of these\r\ngenera; several species of Odontopteris, Callipteris, Cyclopteris,\r\nDioonopteris, Cyatheites, Alethopteris, Noeggerathia, Cordaites,\r\nAnthodiopsis, Dictyothalamus, Calamodendron, Arthropitys; besides\r\nspecies of Sigillaria, Stigmaria, and Lepidodendron. Various fruits\r\nare also mentioned, under the names of Rhabdocarpum, Cardiocarpum,\r\nAcanthocarpum, Trigonocarpum, and Lepidostrobus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FLORA OF THE SECONDARY OR MESOZOIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF GYMNOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57, Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58, Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 57. _Pinus sylvestris_, Scotch Fir.\r\n\r\nFig. 58. _Abies excelsa_, common Spruce Fir of northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFig. 59. _Larix Europæa_, the Larch, indigenous on the\r\nAlps of middle Europe.\r\n\r\nFig. 60. _Cedrus Libani_, Cedar of Lebanon.]\r\n\r\nThe Gymnospermous plants of the present day are included in two\r\nnatural orders, Coniferæ and Cycadaceæ. Under Coniferæ are enumerated\r\nthe various species of Pine (Fig. 57), Spruce (Fig. 58), Larch\r\n(Fig. 59), Cedar (Fig. 60), Eutassa, Araucaria (Fig. 61), Sequoia,\r\nCryptomeria, Taxodium, Cypress, Juniper (Fig. 70), Salisburia,\r\nDacrydium, Yew (Fig. 71), etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61, Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62-64.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 61. _Araucaria excelsa_, called also _Altingia_ or\r\n_Eutassa_ or _Eutacta excelsa_, Norfolk Island Pine.\r\n\r\nFig. 62.

Male flowers\r\nin deciduous catkins; female flowers in cones (Figs. 67, 68). The\r\nseeds are considered by most botanists as being naked, _i.e._ not\r\ncontained in a true pistil (Fig. 69). Some of the conifers have a\r\nsucculent cone, as the juniper (Fig. 70), and the yew (Figs. 71-73)\r\nhas a succulent mass covering a single naked seed (Fig. 73). The yew\r\nalso has its pleurenchyma marked both with punctations and spiral\r\nfibres. The arrangement of the punctations in the Coniferæ gives\r\ncharacters which enable us to classify the woods into groups that\r\nhave some relation to the genera established from the reproductive\r\norgans (see Figs. 62-65).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70-73.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 70.

Among the genera of\r\nthe present day are Cycas (Fig. 74), Zamia, Macrozamia, Encephalartos\r\n(Fig. 75), Dion, Stangeria, etc. They are small palm-like trees or\r\nshrubs, with unbranched stems, occasionally dichotomous, marked\r\nwith leaf-scars, and having large medullary rays along with pitted\r\nwoody tissue. The leaves are pinnate, except in Bowenia, which has a\r\nbipinnate leaf. Males in cones. Females consisting of naked ovules\r\non the edges of altered leaves, or on the inferior surface of the\r\npeltate apex of scales.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE TRIAS AND LIAS EPOCHS._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74-75.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 74. _Cycas revoluta_, one of the false Sago-plants\r\nfound in Japan.\r\n\r\nFig. 75. _Encephalartos (Zamia) pungens_, another\r\nstarch-yielding Cycad.]\r\n\r\nIn this reign the Acrogenous species are less numerous; the\r\nGymnosperms almost equal them in number, and ordinarily surpass them\r\nin frequency. There are two periods in this reign, one in which\r\nConiferæ predominate, while Cycadaceæ scarcely appear; and another\r\nin which the latter family preponderates as regards the number of\r\nspecies, and the frequency and variety of generic forms. Cycadaceæ\r\noccupied a more important place in the ancient than in the present\r\nvegetable world. They extend more or less from the Trias formation up\r\nto the Tertiary. They are rare in the Grès bigarré or lower strata\r\nof the Triassic system. They attain their maximum in the Lias and\r\nOolite, in each of which upwards of 40 species have been enumerated,\r\nand they disappear in the Tertiary formations. Schimper describes\r\n13 genera of fossil Zamiæ, and about 20 Cycadeæ. He thinks that\r\nTrigonocarpum (15 species), Rhabdocarpum (24 species), Cardiocarpum\r\n(21 species), and Carpolithes (9 species), are all fruits of\r\nCycadeæ. Many supposed fossil Cycads are looked upon by Carruthers\r\nas Coniferæ. Zamia macrocephala, or Zamites macrocephalus, or\r\nZamiostrobus macrocephalus, is called by him Pinites macrocephalus;\r\nZamia ovata, or Zamites ovatus, or Zamiostrobus ovatus, is Pinites\r\novatus; Zamia Sussexiensis is Pinites Sussexiensis. Among other\r\nspecies of Pinites noticed by Carruthers are Pinites oblongus,\r\nP. Benstedi, P. Dunkeri, P. Mantellii, P. patens, P. Fittoni, P.\r\nelongatus. It is important to notice that in an existing Cycad called\r\nStangeria paradoxa the veins of the pinnæ rise from a true midrib\r\nand fork, characters which render untenable the distinction usually\r\nrelied upon between the foliage of Ferns and Cycads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 76. _Schizoneura heterophylla_, one of the fossil\r\nConiferæ of the Triassic system.]\r\n\r\nIn Brongniart's Vosgesian period, the Grès bigarré, or the Red\r\nSandstones and Conglomerates of the Triassic system, there is a\r\nchange in the flora. Sigillarias and Lepidodendrons disappear, and\r\nin their place we meet with Gymnosperms, belonging to the genera\r\nVoltzia, Haidingera, Zamites, Ctenis, Æthophyllum, and Schizoneura\r\n(Fig. 76). The genus Voltzia is confined to the Trias, and though a\r\ntrue conifer, it is not easy to correlate it with any living form. It\r\nis apparently Abietineous, having two seeds to each scale, but they\r\nare placed on the dilated upper portion of the scale. The leaves are\r\nof two kinds, the one broad and short, and the other at the tops of\r\nthe branches long and linear. Species of Neuropteris, Pecopteris,\r\nand other acrogenous coal genera are still found, along with species\r\nof Anomopteris and Crematopteris--peculiar Fern-forms, which are\r\nnot found in later formations. Stems of arborescent Ferns are more\r\nfrequent than in the next period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic period of Brongniart embraces the Keupric period or\r\nvariegated marls of the Triassic system, the Liassic epoch, the\r\nOolitic and the Wealden. The flora of the Keupric epoch differs from\r\nthat of the Grès bigarré of the Vosges. The Acrogens are changed as\r\nregards species, and frequently in their genera. Thus we have the\r\ngenera Camptopteris, Sagenopteris, and Equisetum. Among Gymnosperms,\r\nthe genera Pterophyllum and Taxodites occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78-79.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figs. 77 to 81.

It is found in the Oolite of Stonesfield\r\n(Lindley and Hutton).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nIn the Lias the essential characters of the flora are the\r\npredominance of Cycadaceæ, in the form of species of Cycadites,\r\nOtozamites, Zamites (Fig. 77), Ctenis, Pterophyllum (Fig. 78),\r\nand Nilssonia (Fig. 79), Palæozamia (Fig. 80), and the existence\r\namong the Ferns of many genera with reticulated venation, such as\r\nCamptopteris and Thaumatopteris, some of which began to appear at\r\nthe Keupric epoch. Coniferous genera, as Brachyphyllum (Fig. 81),\r\nTaxodites, Palissya, and Peuce, are found. In the Lias near Cromarty,\r\nMiller states that he found a cone with long bracts like those of\r\nPinus bracteata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE OOLITIC EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Oolitic epoch the flora consists of numerous Cycadaceæ and\r\nConiferæ, some of them having peculiar forms. Its distinctive\r\ncharacters are, the rarity of Ferns with reticulated venation,\r\nwhich are so numerous in the Lias, the frequency of the Cycadaceous\r\ngenera Otozamites and Zamites, which are most analogous to those\r\nnow existing; the occurrence of a remarkable group presenting very\r\nanomalous structure in their organs of reproduction, to which\r\nCarruthers has given the name of Williamsonia; and the diminution\r\nof Ctenis, Pterophyllum, Palæozamia, and Nilssonia, genera far\r\nremoved from the living kinds; and lastly, the greater frequency\r\nof the coniferous genera, Brachyphyllum and Thuites, which are\r\nmuch more rare in the Lias. In the Scottish Oolite at Helmsdale,\r\nMiller detected about 60 species of plants, including Cycadaceæ\r\nand Coniferæ, with detached cones, and Fern-forms resembling\r\nScolopendrium. He also discovered a species of Equisetum, and what he\r\nsupposed to be a Calamite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81-82.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 81. _Brachyphyllum mammillare_, a Coniferous plant of\r\nthe Oolitic system, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nFig. 82. _Equisetum columnare_, a fossil species of the\r\nOolite of Yorkshire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83-85.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 83. _Araucarites sphærocarpus_, Carr., found in the\r\ninferior Oolite at Bruton, Somersetshire.\r\n\r\nFig. 84.

It is found in the Oolite of\r\nthe Island of Portland, in a silicified state.]\r\n\r\nThere is an absence of true coal-fields in the secondary formations\r\ngenerally; but in some of the Oolitic series, as in the lower Oolite\r\nat Brora, in Sutherlandshire, and in the north-east of Yorkshire,\r\nand the Kimmeridge clay of the upper Oolite, near Weymouth, there\r\nare considerable deposits of carbonaceous matter, sometimes forming\r\nseams of coal which have been worked for economic purposes.[19] Some\r\nsuppose that the Brora coal was formed chiefly by Equisetum columnare\r\n(Fig. 82). In the sandstones and shales of the Oolitic series,\r\nespecially in the lower Oolite of the north of England, as at Whitby\r\nand Scarborough, as well as in Stonesfield slate, the Portland Crag\r\nof the middle, and the Portland beds of the upper Oolite, numerous\r\nfossil plants are found. Peuce Lindleyana is one of the Coniferæ\r\nof the lower Oolite. Beania (Plate II. Fig. 2) is a Cycadaceous\r\nfossil from the Oolite of Yorkshire (Carruthers, Geol. Mag. vi. 91).\r\nAraucarites sphærocarpus (Figs. 83, 84, 85) is found in the inferior\r\nOolite, and separate scales of Araucarian fruits occur in the Oolitic\r\nshales of Yorkshire (Araucarites Phillipsii, Plate II. Fig. 11), and\r\nin the \"slate\" at Stonesfield (A. Brodiei, Plate II. Fig. 10). The\r\nupper Oolite at Portland contains an interesting bed, about a foot in\r\nthickness, of a dark brown substance. This is the _Dirt-bed_ (Fig.\r\n86) made up of black loam, which, during the Purbeck period, formed\r\na surface soil which was penetrated by the roots of trees, fragments\r\nof whose stems are now found in it fossilised. These consist of\r\nan assemblage of silicified stumps or stools of large trees, from\r\n1-3 feet high, standing in their original position, with the roots\r\nremaining attached to them, and still penetrating the earth in which\r\nthey grew. Besides the erect trunks many stems have been broken and\r\nthrown down, and are buried in a horizontal position in the bed.\r\nThey belong to Coniferæ and Cycadaceæ. One of these is Mantellia\r\nnidiformis, shown in Fig. 87. Carpolithes conicus and C. Bucklandi\r\nare fruits found in the Oolite. Some look upon them as fruits of\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88-89.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 88. _Kaidacarpum ooliticum_, Carr., fruit of a fossil\r\nallied to Pandanaceæ, from the great Oolite near Northampton.\r\n\r\nFig. 89. _Pandanus odoratissimus_, Screw-pine, with\r\nadventitious roots.]\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Pandanaceous fruits have been found in Oolitic\r\nstrata. Buckland described one of them as Podocarya, which is\r\nremarkable, as it consists of a single but many-seeded drupe. To\r\nanother form, more nearly allied to the existing plants, Carruthers\r\nhas given the name Kaidacarpum, and has described three species.\r\nThese fruits are made up of a large number of single-seeded drupes.\r\nThe species figured (Fig. 88) is from the great Oolite, near\r\nNorthampton. In Fig. 89 a representation is given of one of the\r\nPandanaceæ, the screw-pines of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE WEALDEN EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 90. Fossil Wood, _Abietites Linkii_. A Coniferous\r\nplant from the Wealden, showing punctated woody tissue and medullary\r\nrays.]\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Wealden epoch is characterised in the south of\r\nEngland by the abundance of the fern called Lonchopteris Mantellii,\r\nand in Germany by the predominance of the Conifer denominated\r\nAbietites Linkii (Fig. 90), and the presence of Araucarites\r\nPippingfordensis, as well as by numerous Cycadaceæ, such as species\r\nof Cycadites, Zamites, Pterophyllum, Mantellia, Bucklandia, and a\r\nremarkable genus having a fleshy fruit, and related to the ordinary\r\nCycadaceæ as Taxus is to the other Coniferæ, which has been fully\r\ndescribed in the Linn. Trans., under the name of Bennettites (Plate\r\nII. Fig. 3). In the Wealden at Brook Point, Isle of Wight, Cycads\r\nhave been detected allied to Encephalartos. The fruits of them are\r\ndescribed by Carruthers as Cycadeostrobus. He describes the following\r\nspecies:--Cycadeostrobus ovatus (Plate II. Fig. 1), C. truncatus, C.\r\ntumidus, C. elegans, C. Walkeri, C. sphæricus, in the Oxford clay of\r\nWiltshire; C. primævus in the inferior Oolite at Burcott Wood and\r\nLivingston, and C. Brunonis. Mantell states that he has found 40 or\r\n50 fossil cones in the Wealden of England; they belong either to the\r\ngenus Cycadeostrobus or to the pines mentioned below as occurring in\r\nthe Wealden. The Wealden fresh-water formation terminates the reign\r\nof Gymnosperms. Carruthers gives the following list of the remains of\r\nConiferæ which have been found in the secondary strata of Britain,\r\nexcluding the Trias:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Chalk.--Wood in flint nodules.\r\n\r\n  Upper Greensand.--Foliage and cone of Sequoiites Woodwardii; cone\r\n  of Pinites oblongus.\r\n\r\n  Gault.--Cones of Pinites gracilis and P. hexagonus, Sequoiites\r\n  Gardneri and S. ovalis.\r\n\r\n  Lower Greensand.--Water-worn and bored pieces of wood; cones of\r\n  Pinites Benstedi, P. Sussexiensis, and P. Leckenbyi.\r\n\r\n  Wealden.--Driftwood, foliage of Abietites Linkii; cones of\r\n  Pinites Dunkeri, P. Mantellii, P. patens, and P. Fittoni, and\r\n  of Araucaria Pippingfordensis; foliage (and drupes?) of Thuites\r\n  Kurrianus.\r\n\r\n  Purbeck.--Fossil forest _in situ_ at Isle of Portland; cone\r\n  \"nearly related to Araucaria excelsa\" in the Dirt-bed.\r\n\r\n  Portland Stone.--Driftwood Araucarites.\r\n\r\n  Kimmeridge Clay.--Cone of Pinites depressus.\r\n\r\n  Oxford Clay.--Driftwood and foliage of Araucarites.\r\n\r\n  Great Oolite.--Driftwood of Araucarites; foliage of Thuites\r\n  acutifolius, T. articulatus, T. cupressiformis, T. divaricatus,\r\n  and T. expansus, and of Taxites podocarpoides; detached cones at\r\n  Helmsdale, Sutherland.\r\n\r\n  Inferior Oolite.--Wood of Peuce Eggensis (Tertiary according to\r\n  Geikie); foliage of Brachyphyllum mammillare, Cryptomerites?\r\n  divaricatus, and Palissya? Williamsonis; cones of Araucarites\r\n  sphærocarpus, A. Brodiei, and A. Phillipsii. Pinites primæva\r\n  (Lindl. and Hutt.) is a Cycadean fruit.\r\n\r\n  Lias.--Wood of Pinites Huttonianus and P. Lindleyanus; foliage\r\n  of Araucaria peregrina and Cupressus latifolia; cone of Pinites\r\n  elongatus, and \"cone with long bracts like those of Pinus\r\n  bracteata,\" from Cromarty.\r\n\r\nCarruthers gives the following arrangement of fossil Cycadaceæ in\r\nthe Transactions of the Linn. Soc. vol. xxvi.--Firstly, the Cycadeæ:\r\nincluding the genus Bucklandia, Presl; and species B. anomala, B.\r\nMantellii, B. squamosa, B. Milleriana--the two first-named species\r\nbeing from the Wealden, and the two last-named from the Oolite.\r\nSecondly, the Zamieæ: including the genus Yatesia, Carr.; and\r\nspecies Y. Morrisi, Lower Cretaceous; Y. gracilis, Lias; Y. crassa,\r\nM. Oolite; Y. Joassiana, M. Oolite; the genus Fittonia, Carr., and\r\nspecies F. squamata, U. Cretaceous; the genus Crossozamia, Pomel,\r\nand species C. Moreaui, Pomel, Jurassic, and C. Buvignieri, Pomel,\r\nJurassic--both from St. Michel, France. Thirdly, the Williamsonieæ:\r\nincluding the genus Williamsonia, Carr.; and species W. gigas, W.\r\npecten, W. hastula, all from the inferior Oolite. Fourthly, the\r\nBennettiteæ: including the genus Bennettites, Carr., and species\r\nB. Saxbyanus, Wealden; B. Gibsonianus, Lr. Greensand; B. maximus,\r\nWealden; B. Portlandicus, Lr. Purbeck; and B. Peachianus, M.\r\nOolite; the genus Mantellia, Brong., and species M. nidiformis, M.\r\nintermedia, M. microphylla, from the Lr. Purbeck; and M. inclusa,\r\nfrom the Lr. Cretaceous; the genus Raumeria, Goeppert, and species R.\r\nReichenbachiana, from Galicia, and R. Schulziana from Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FLORA OF THE TERTIARY OR CAINOZOIC PERIOD,\r\n\r\n(INCLUDING THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF ANGIOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reign is characterised by the appearance of Angiospermous\r\nDicotyledons, plants which constitute more than three-fourths of the\r\nspecies of the existing flowering plants of the globe, and which\r\nappear to have acquired the predominance from the commencement of the\r\nTertiary epoch. They are plants with seeds contained in seed-vessels,\r\nand each seed with two cotyledons. These plants, however, appear even\r\nat the beginning of the Cretaceous period. In this reign, therefore,\r\nBrongniart includes the upper Secondary period, or the Cretaceous\r\nsystem, and all the Tertiary period. The Cretaceous may be considered\r\nas a sort of transition period between the reign of Gymnosperms and\r\nAngiosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE CHALK._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chalk flora is characterised by the Gymnospermous almost\r\nequalling the Angiospermous Dicotyledons, and by the existence of a\r\nconsiderable number of Cycadaceæ, which do not appear in the Tertiary\r\nperiod. The genus Credneria is one of the characteristic forms. In\r\nthis period we find Algæ represented by Cystoseirites, Confervites,\r\nSargassites, and Chondrites; Ferns by peculiar species of Pecopteris\r\nand Protopteris; Naiadaceæ by Zosterites; Palms, by Flabellaria and\r\nPalmacites; Cycadaceæ by Cycadites, Zamites, Microzamia, Fittonia,\r\nand Bennettites; Coniferæ, by Brachyphyllum, Widdringtonites,\r\nCryptomeria, Abietites, Pinites, Cunninghamites, Dammarites,\r\nAraucarites; and Angiospermous Dicotyledons, by Comptonites, Alnites,\r\nCarpinites, Salicites, Acerites, Juglandites, and Credneria. At the\r\nbase of the Tertiary period there are deposits of Algæ of a very\r\npeculiar form, belonging to the genera Chondrites and Munsteria. No\r\nland plants have been found mingled with these marine species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 91. _Sequoiites ovalis._ Large cone.]\r\n\r\nIn the Gault, near Folkestone, an interesting association of\r\nconiferous fruits has been found, consisting of two species of\r\nSequoia, along with two of Pinus. The pines belong to the same group\r\nas those which now grow with the Wellingtonias in California, showing\r\nthe remarkable fact that the coniferous vegetation of the high lands\r\nof the Upper Cretaceous period had a _facies_ similar to that now\r\nexisting in the mountains on the west of North America. We figure\r\nboth the species of Sequoiites--viz. S. ovalis (Fig. 91), a large\r\ncone, and S. Gardneri (Plate II. Fig. 7). In the present day there\r\nare two species of the genus Sequoia--viz. S. gigantea (Wellingtonia\r\ngigantea) and S. sempervirens.[20] In the Lower Greensand a\r\nremarkably fine cone belonging to the same group as the Cedar has\r\nbeen found. This is the Pinites Leckenbyi (Plate II. Fig. 4). A\r\nsection exhibits the seeds in their true position, some of which are\r\npreserved so as to exhibit the form and position of the embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 92. _Pinites ovatus_ (_Zamia ovata_ of Lindley and\r\nHutton), an ovate cone with a truncated base and obtuse apex, nearly\r\nallied to the stone-pine.]\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary period is characterised by the abundance of\r\nAngiospermous Dicotyledons and of Monocotyledons, more especially of\r\nPalms. By this it is distinguished from the more ancient periods.\r\nAngiosperms at this period greatly exceed Gymnosperms. Cycadaceæ\r\nare very rare, if not completely wanting, in the European Tertiary\r\nstrata, and the Coniferæ belong to genera of the temperate regions.\r\nIn the lower Tertiaries Carruthers has found a fossil Osmunda, and\r\nthe existence of a group of Pines having cones with a very thick\r\napophysis. From their remarkable external aspect, these cones\r\nhad been considered to be Cycadean, but their internal structure\r\nindicates that they are coniferous. Pinites ovatus is one of\r\nthese cones (Fig. 92). The Cupressineæ are found in the Tertiary\r\nbeds only. Taxodieæ are represented by Sequoiites (Plate II. Fig.\r\n7) in the Cretaceous and Eocene strata. Peuce australis of Van\r\nDiemen's Land and P. Pritchardi of Ireland are Tertiary plants.\r\nThe Peuce of Eigg (P. Eggensis), according to Geikie, is also\r\nTertiary, and not Oolitic. Isoetes is mentioned by Schimper as a\r\nTertiary genus. Although the vegetation throughout the whole of the\r\nTertiary period presents pretty uniform characters, still there\r\nare notable differences in the generic and specific forms, and in\r\nthe predominance of certain orders at different epochs. Brongniart\r\ndoes not entirely agree with Unger as to these epochs. Many of the\r\nformations classified by Unger in the Miocene division he refers with\r\nRaulin to the Pliocene. He divides the Tertiary period, as regards\r\nplants, into the Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene epochs, and gives the\r\nfollowing comparative results from an examination of their floras:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n  | Classes and     |               |                |                 |\r\n  | Sub-Classes.    | Eocene Epoch. | Miocene Epoch. | Pliocene Epoch. |\r\n  +-----------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n  | Thallogenæ      |      16       |        6       |         6       |\r\n  | Acrogenæ        |      17       |        4       |         7       |\r\n  | Monocotyledones |      33       |       26       |         4       |\r\n  | Dicotyledones-- |               |                |                 |\r\n  |   Gymnospermæ   |      40       |       19       |        31       |\r\n  |   Angiospermæ   |     103       |       78       |       164       |\r\n  +-----------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n  |                 |     209       |      133       |       212       |\r\n  +-----------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE EOCENE EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Eocene formation the fossil fruits of the Isle of Sheppey\r\nincrease the number of Phanerogamous plants, only a small proportion\r\nof which have as yet been described. This is an exceptional locality,\r\nand the deposit in which the fruits occur is probably the silt found\r\nat the mouth of a large river which flowed, like the Nile, from\r\ntropical regions towards the north. The number of plants as given by\r\nBrongniart is much smaller than that mentioned by Unger (p. 23). The\r\nlatter includes in his enumeration a considerable amount of uncertain\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 93. _Palmacites Lamanonis_. Fan-shaped (flabellate)\r\nleaf of a Palm.]\r\n\r\nThe Eocene epoch in general is characterised by the predominance of\r\nAlgæ and marine Naiadaceæ, such as Caulinites and Zosterites; by\r\nnumerous Coniferæ, the greater part resembling existing genera among\r\nthe Cupressineæ, and appearing in the form of Juniperites, Thuites,\r\nCupressinites (Plate II. Figs. 8, 9), Callitrites, Frenelites, and\r\nSolenostrobus; by the existence of a number of extra-European forms,\r\nespecially of fruits, such as Nipadites, Leguminosites, Cucumites,\r\nand Hightea; and by the presence of some large species of Palm\r\nbelonging to the genera Flabellaria and Palmacites (Fig. 93).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 94. _Osmunda regalis_, Royal Fern, having a bipinnate\r\nfrond and fructification in a spike-like form, the branches bearing\r\nsporangia.]\r\n\r\nUnger says that the Eocene flora has resembled in many respects that\r\nof the present Australian vegetation. He gives the following genera\r\nas occurring at the Eocene epoch:--Araucaria, Podocarpus, Libocedrus,\r\nCallitris, Casuarina, Pterocarpus, Drepanocarpus, Centrolobium,\r\nDalbergia, Cassia, Cæsalpinia, Bauhinia, Copaifera, Entada, Acacia,\r\nMimosa, Inga. (Seemann's Journal of Bot. vol. iii. p. 43.) Amber is\r\nconsidered to be the produce of many Coniferæ of this epoch, such\r\nas Peuce succinifera or Pinites succinifera, and Pinus Rinkianus. It\r\noccurs in East Prussia in great quantity, and it is said that many\r\npieces of fossil wood occur there, which, when moderately heated,\r\ngive out a decided smell of amber. Connected with these beds are\r\nfound cones belonging to Pinites sylvestrina and P. Pumilio-miocena,\r\nspecies nearly allied to the living species; others to Pinites\r\nThomasianus and P. brachylepis. Goeppert contrasts the present flora\r\nof Germany and that of the Amber epoch as follows:--\r\n\r\n                     German Flora.   Amber Flora.\r\n\r\n  Cryptogameæ             6800            60\r\n  Phanerogameæ            3454           102\r\n\r\nand gives the following specimens of two of the orders:--\r\n\r\n  Cupuliferæ                12            10\r\n  Ericaceæ                  23            24\r\n\r\n(See remarks by Goeppert on the Amber Flora, etc., Edin. N. Phil.\r\nJourn. lvi. 368; and Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. x. 37.) In the lower\r\nEocene of Herne Bay, Carruthers noticed a fern like Osmunda (Fig.\r\n94), which he calls Osmundites Dowkeri (Plate I. Figs. 8, 9). This\r\nspecimen was silicified; starch grains contained in its cells, and\r\nthe mycelium of a parasitic fungus traversing some of them, were\r\nperfectly preserved. Berkeley has detected in amber fossil fungi,\r\nwhich he has named Penicillium curtipes, Brachycladium Thomasinum,\r\nand Streptothrix spiralis.[21] Some Characeæ are also met with, as\r\nChara medicaginula and C. prisca, with a fossil called Gyrogonites,\r\nthe nucule or the fructification of these plants. Carpolithes ovatus,\r\na minute seed-vessel, occurs in the Eocene beds of Lewisham. Another\r\nsmall fruit, of a similar nature, called Folliculites minutulus,\r\noccurs in the Bovey Tracey coal, which belongs to the Tertiary beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE MIOCENE EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 95. _Comptonia acutiloba_, apparently the leaf of\r\na plant belonging to the natural order Proteaceæ, which abound in\r\nAustralia, and are also found at the Cape of Good Hope at the present\r\nday.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figures 96 to 99 show the leaves of plants belonging to\r\nthe Miocene epoch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96-97.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 96. _Acer trilobatum_, a three-lobed palmate leaf,\r\nlike that of the Maple, with the lobes unequal, inciso-dentate, the\r\nlateral ones spreading, found at Œningen.

Fig. 98. _Rhamnus\r\nAizoon_, a petiolate elliptical obtuse feather-veined leaf, with an\r\nentire margin, found in Styria.]\r\n\r\nThe most striking characters of the Miocene epoch consist in the\r\nmixture of exotic forms of warm regions with those of temperate\r\nclimates. Unger says that it resembles that of the southern part\r\nof North America. Thus we meet with Palms, such as species of\r\nFlabellaria and Phœnicites, a kind of Bamboo called Bambusium\r\nsepultum; Lauraceæ, as Daphnogene and Laurus; Combretaceæ, as\r\nGetonia and Terminalia; Leguminosæ, as Phaseolites, Desmodophyllum,\r\nDolichites, Erythrina, Bauhinia, Mimosites, and Acacia--all plants\r\nhaving their living representatives in warm climates; Echitonium,\r\nPlumiera, and other Apocynaceæ of equatorial regions; Comptonia (Fig.\r\n95), a Proteaceous genus, and Steinhauera, a Cinchonaceous genus;\r\nmingled with species of Acer (Fig. 96), Ulmus (Fig. 97), Rhamnus\r\n(Fig. 98); and Amentiferous forms, such as Myrica, Betula, Alnus\r\n(Fig. 99), Quercus, Fagus, Carpinus, all belonging to temperate\r\nand cold climates. The statements as to the occurrence of Pinus\r\nsylvestris and Betula alba among the Miocene fossils have not been\r\nfounded on complete data. It is by no means easy, even in the present\r\nday, to distinguish fragments of dried specimens of Pinus Pumilio\r\nfrom those of P. sylvestris, and from a great many other Pines.\r\nThe difficulty is still greater in fossils (Hook. Kew Journ. v.\r\n413). There are a very small number of plants belonging to orders\r\nwith gamopetalous corollas. In the Miocene formation of Lough\r\nNeagh in Ireland, and of Mull in Scotland, silicified trunks of\r\nconsiderable size have been found. The Irish silicified wood has been\r\ndenominated Cupressoxylon Pritchardi from its apparent resemblance\r\nto the Cypress. As connected with the Miocene epoch, we may notice\r\nthe leaf-beds found at Ardtun, in the island of Mull, by the Duke\r\nof Argyll.[22] Above and below these beds basalt occurs, and there\r\nare peculiar tuff-beds alternating with the leafy deposits. These\r\ntuff-beds were formed by the deposit of volcanic dust in pools\r\nprobably of fresh water. They contain fragments of chalk and flint.\r\nThe leaves are those of plants allied to the Yew, Rhamnus, Plane, and\r\nAlder, along with the fronds of a peculiar Fern, and the stems of an\r\nEquisetum. The genera are Taxites or Taxodites (Fig. 100), Rhamnites\r\n(Fig. 101), Platanites, Alnites, Filicites, and Equisetum (Fig.\r\n102). In the leaf-beds at Bournemouth Mr. Wanklyn detected several\r\nferns. One is a species of Didymosorus, and shows distinct venation\r\nand fructification. Fossilised wood was found in the Arctic Regions\r\nby Captain M'Clure. At the N.W. of Banks Land he found trees with\r\ntrunks 1 foot 7 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99-101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 99. _Alnus gracilis_, an ovate-oblong leaf, like that\r\nof the Alder, found in Bohemia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figures 100, 101, 102, exhibit fragments of plants which\r\noccur in the leaf-bed at Ardtun Head, in Mull, and which is referred\r\nto the Miocene epoch. The figures are from the Duke of Argyll's\r\npaper.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 100. _Taxites_, or perhaps _Taxodites Campbellii_, a\r\nbranch with leaves resembling those of the Yew, or rather those of\r\nTaxodium.\r\n\r\nFig. 101. _Rhamnites multinervatus_, a leaf resembling\r\nthat of Rhamnus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. 102. _Equisetum Campbellii_, a stem like that of an\r\nEquisetum of the present day.]\r\n\r\nDr. Oswald Heer[23] has examined the plants preserved in the lignite\r\nbeds of Bovey Tracey, in Devonshire, and he finds that they belong\r\nto the Miocene formation. There is a remarkable coincidence between\r\nthis and several of the continental fossil floras, such as those\r\nof Salzhauser in the Wetterau, Manosque in Provence, and of some\r\nparts of Switzerland. Bovey Tracey has no species in common with\r\nIceland, although the Tertiary flora of Iceland belongs to the\r\nsame period. Two of its species (Corylus MacQuarrii and Platanus\r\naceroides) have been found in the Miocene of Ardtun Head. Even the\r\ngenera are distinct, with the exception of Sequoia and Quercus. The\r\nBovey Tracey flora has a much more southern character, corresponding\r\nentirely with that of the Lower Miocene of Switzerland. It contains\r\nthree species of Cinnamon, one Laurel, evergreen Figs, one Palm, and\r\nlarge Ferns, thus manifesting a subtropical climate. One of the most\r\nimportant plants is Sequoia Couttsiæ, a Conifer which supplies a link\r\nbetween S. Langsdorfii and S. Sternbergi, the widely-distributed\r\nrepresentatives of S. sempervirens and S. gigantea (Wellingtonia),\r\nwhich are Californian trees. Among other characteristic plants may be\r\nmentioned Cinnamomum lanceolatum and C. Scheuchzeri; Quercus Lyellii,\r\nan evergreen oak; species of evergreen fig (Ficus Falconeri and F.\r\nPengellii), Palmacites Dæmonorops, a prickly twining Rotang-palm;\r\nspecies of Vine (Vitis Hookeri and V. Britannica); Pecopteris\r\nlignitum, a large tree-fern; species of Nyssa, at present confined\r\nto North America. Among other plants recorded by Heer in his paper\r\nare the following:--Laurus primigenia, Daphnogene Ungeri, species\r\nof Dryandroides, Andromeda, Vaccinium acheronticum, Echitonium\r\ncuspidatum, Gardenia Wetzleri, species of Anona, Nymphæa Doris,\r\nCarpolithes Websteri, C. Boveyanus, and other species. In the\r\npost-tertiary white clay of Bovey Tracey, Salix cinerea, and a\r\nspecies allied to S. repens, as well as Betula nana, are found.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic fossil flora (Miocene), according to Heer, amounts to\r\n162 species: Cryptogamia, 18 species, of which 9 are large ferns;\r\nPhanerogamia, Coniferæ, 31; Monocotyledons, 14; Dicotyledons, 99.\r\nAmong the Coniferæ are--Pinus M'Clurii, Sequoia Langsdorffii,\r\nSternbergi, and Couttsiæ, Taxodium dubium, Glyptostrobus europæus,\r\nThujopsis europæa. Among leafy trees are--Fagus Deucalionis, Quercus\r\nOlafseni, Platanus aceroides, willows, beeches, Acer, Otopteryx,\r\ntulip-tree, walnuts, Magnolia Inglefieldi, Prunus Scottii, Tilia\r\nMalmgreni, Corylus M'Quarrii, Alnus Kefersteinii, Daphnogene Kannii,\r\nprobably one of the Lauraceæ; and among Proteaceæ, MacClintockia? and\r\nHakea. In Greenland are found species of Rhamnus, Paliurus, Cornus,\r\nIlex, Cratægus, Andromeda, Myrica, Ivy, and Vine. From the flora of\r\nSpitzbergen, in the Miocene epoch, we may conclude that under 79°\r\nN. lat. the mean temperature of the year may have been 41° Fahr.,\r\nwhile at the same epoch that of Switzerland was 69°·8 Fahr.; judging\r\nfrom the analogy of floras, it appears that the mean temperature\r\nhas fallen 6°·9. From this it follows that at Spitzbergen, at\r\n78° N. lat., the mean temperature was perhaps 41°·9 Fahr. In\r\nGreenland, at 70°, it would be 49°·1 Fahr., and in Iceland and on\r\nthe Mackenzie, in lat. 65°, it would be 52°·7 Fahr. At the Miocene\r\nepoch the temperature seems to have been much more uniform, the\r\nmean heat diminishing much more gradually in proportion as the pole\r\nwas approached. The isothermal line of 32° Fahr. might have fallen\r\nupon the pole, while now it is situated under 58° N. (See Heer's\r\nconclusions as to changes of temperature depending on proportion\r\nof sea and land, eccentricity of the earth, and the earth moving\r\nthrough warm and cold spaces in the universe--Ann. Nat. Hist. 4th\r\nser. i. 66.)\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Polar flora of former epochs, Heer says that every\r\nplant executes a slow and continuous migration. These migrations,\r\nthe starting-point of which is the distant past, are recorded in\r\nthe rocks; and the interweaving of the carpets of flowers which\r\nadorn our present creation retraces them for us in its turn. For\r\nthe vegetation of the present day is closely connected with that of\r\npreceding epochs; and throughout all these vegetable creations reigns\r\n_one_ thought, which not only reveals itself around us by thousands\r\nupon thousands of images, but strikes us everywhere in the icy\r\nregions of the extreme north. Organic nature may become impoverished\r\nthere, and even disappear when a cold mantle of ice extends over the\r\nwhole earth; but where the flowers die the rocks speak, and relate\r\nthe marvels of creation; they tell us that even in the most distant\r\ncountries, and in the remotest parts, nature was governed by the same\r\nlaws and the same harmony as immediately around us.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLORA OF THE PLIOCENE EPOCH._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Pliocene epoch has a great analogy to that of the\r\ntemperate regions of Europe, North America, and Japan. We meet with\r\nConiferæ, Amentiferæ, Rosaceæ, Leguminosæ, Rhamnaceæ, Aceraceæ,\r\nAquifoliaceæ, Ericaceæ, and many other orders. There is a small\r\nnumber of Dicotyledons with gamopetalous corollas. The twenty\r\nspecies with such corollas recognised by Brongniart are referred to\r\nthe Hypogynous Gamopetalous group of Exogens, which in the general\r\norganisation of the flowers approach nearest to Dialypetalæ. In\r\nthis flora there is the predominance of Dicotyledons in number and\r\nvariety; there are few Monocotyledons. No species appear to be\r\nidentical, at least with the plants which now grow in Europe. Thus\r\nthe flora of Europe, even at the most recent geological epoch of the\r\nTertiary period, was very different from the European flora of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nTaking the natural orders which have at least four representatives,\r\nRaulin[25] gives the following statement as to the Tertiary flora\r\nof central Europe. The Eocene flora of Europe is composed of 128\r\nspecies, of which 115 belong to Algæ, Characeæ, Pandanaceæ, Palmæ,\r\nNaiadaceæ, Malvaceæ, Sapindaceæ, Proteaceæ, Papilionaceæ, and\r\nCupressineæ. The Miocene flora has 112 species, of which 69 belong to\r\nAlgæ, Palmæ, Naiadaceæ, Apocynaceæ, Aceraceæ, Lauraceæ, Papilionaceæ,\r\nPlatanaceæ, Quercineæ, Myricaceæ, and Abietineæ. The Pliocene\r\nflora has 258 species, of which 226 belong to Algæ, Fungi, Musci,\r\nFilices, Palmæ, Ericaceæ, Aquifoliaceæ, Aceraceæ, Ulmaceæ, Rhamnaceæ,\r\nPapilionaceæ, Juglandaceæ, Salicaceæ, Quercineæ, Betulaceæ, Taxaceæ,\r\nCupressineæ, and Abietineæ. The Eocene species are included in\r\ngenera which belong at the present day to inter-tropical regions,\r\ncomprising in them India and the Asiatic islands of Australia. Some\r\nare peculiar to the Mediterranean region. The aquatic plants, which\r\nform almost one-third of the flora, belong to genera now peculiar to\r\nthe temperate regions of Europe and of North America, or occurring\r\neverywhere. The Miocene species belong to genera, of which several\r\nare found in India, tropical America, and the other inter-tropical\r\nregions, but which for the most part inhabit the sub-tropical and\r\ntemperate regions, including the United States. Some of the genera\r\nare peculiar to the temperate regions. The aquatic genera, poor in\r\nspecies, occur everywhere, or else solely in the temperate regions.\r\nThe Pliocene species belong to genera which almost all inhabit the\r\ntemperate regions, either of the old continent or of the United\r\nStates. A few only are of genera existing in India, Japan, and the\r\nnorth of Africa. These various floras, which present successively\r\nthe character of those of inter-tropical, sub-tropical, and\r\ntemperate regions, seem to indicate that central Europe has, since\r\nthe commencement of the Tertiary period, been subjected, during\r\nthe succession of time, to the influence of these three different\r\ntemperatures. It would appear, then, Raulin remarks, that the climate\r\nof Europe has during the Tertiary period gradually become more\r\ntemperate.\r\n\r\nBrown coal occurs in the upper Tertiary beds, and in it vegetable\r\nstructure is easily seen under the microscope. Goeppert, on examining\r\nthe brown coal deposits of northern Germany and the Rhine, finds that\r\nConiferæ predominate in a remarkable degree; among 300 specimens of\r\nbituminous wood collected in the Silesian brown coal deposits alone,\r\nonly a very few other kinds of Exogenous wood occur. This seems\r\nremarkable, inasmuch as in the clays of the brown coal formation\r\nin many other places leaves of deciduous Dicotyledonous trees have\r\nbeen found; and yet the stems on which we may suppose them to have\r\ngrown are wanting. The leaves have been floated away from the place\r\nwhere they grew by a current of water which was not powerful enough\r\nto transport the stems. The coniferous plants of these brown coal\r\ndeposits belong to Taxineæ and Cupressineæ chiefly; among the plants\r\nare Pinites protolarix and Taxites Ayckii. Many of the Coniferæ\r\nexhibit highly compressed, very narrow annual rings, such as occur in\r\nConiferæ of northern latitudes. Goeppert has described a trunk, or\r\nrather the lower end of a trunk, of Pinites protolarix, discovered\r\nin 1849 in the brown coal of Laasan in Silesia. It was found in a\r\nnearly perpendicular position, and measured more than 32 feet in\r\ncircumference. Sixteen vast roots ran out almost at right angles from\r\nthe base of the trunk, of which about four feet stood up perfect in\r\nform, but stripped of bark. Unfortunately the interior of the stem\r\nwas almost entirely filled with structureless brown coal, so that\r\nonly two cross sections could be obtained from the outer parts, one\r\nsixteen inches, the other three feet six inches broad. In the first\r\nsection Goeppert counted 700, in the second 1300 rings of wood, so\r\nthat for the half-diameter of 5½ feet, at least 2200 rings must have\r\nexisted. As there is every reason to believe that the rings were\r\nformed in earlier ages just as the annual zones are now, this tree\r\nwould be from 2200 to 2500 years old. Exogenous stems in lignite are\r\noften of great size and age. In a trunk near Bonn, Nöggerath counted\r\n792 annual rings. In the turf bogs of the Somme, at Yseux near\r\nAbbeville, a trunk of an oak-tree has been found above 14 feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_GENERAL CONCLUSIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen that the vegetation of the globe is represented\r\nby numerous distinct floras connected with the different periods\r\nof its history, and that the farther back we go, the more are the\r\nplants different from those of the present day. There can be no doubt\r\nthat there have been successive deposits of stratified rocks, and\r\nsuccessive creations of living beings. We see that animals and plants\r\nhave gone through their different phases of existence, and that their\r\nremains in all stages of growth and decay have been imbedded in rocks\r\nsuperimposed upon each other in regular succession. It is impossible\r\nto conceive that these were the result of changes produced within the\r\nlimits of a few days. Considering the depth of stratification, and\r\nthe condition and nature of the living beings found in the strata at\r\nvarious depths, we must conclude (unless our senses are mocked by\r\nthe phenomena presented to our view) that vast periods have elapsed\r\nsince the Creator in the beginning created the heavens and the earth.\r\nHow far it may be possible in the future to correlate the history\r\nof the earth inscribed on its rocky tablets and deciphered by the\r\ngeologist, and that short narrative which forms the introduction to\r\nthe Sacred Volume, it is too difficult to say. At present there are\r\nno satisfactory materials for such a correlation; but one thing is\r\ncertain, that both Revelation and Geology testify with one voice to\r\nthe work of a Divine Creator.\r\n\r\n\"Who shall declare (Hugh Miller remarks) what through long ages the\r\nhistory of creation has been? We see at wide intervals the mere\r\nfragments of successive Floras; but know not how, what seem the\r\nblank interspaces, were filled; or how, as extinction overtook in\r\nsuccession one tribe of existences after another, and species, like\r\nindividuals, yielded to the great law of death, yet other species\r\nwere brought to the birth, and ushered upon the scene, and the chain\r\nof being was maintained unbroken. We see only detached bits of\r\nthat green web which has covered our earth ever since the dry land\r\nfirst appeared. But the web itself seems to have been continuous\r\nthroughout all time; though, as breadth after breadth issued from\r\nthe creative loom, the pattern was altered, and the sculpturesque\r\nand graceful forms that illustrated its first beginnings and its\r\nmiddle spaces have yielded to flowers of richer colour and blow, and\r\nfruits of fairer shade and outline; and for gigantic club-mosses\r\nstretching forth their hirsute arms, goodly trees of the Lord have\r\nexpanded their great boughs; and for the barren fern and the calamite\r\nclustering in thickets beside the waters, or spreading on flowerless\r\nhill-slopes, luxuriant orchards have yielded their ruddy flush, and\r\nrich harvests their golden gleam.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we find animals and plants, of forms unknown at the present\r\nday, in all stages of development, we read a lesson as to the\r\nhistory of the earth's former state as conclusive as that which\r\nis derived from the Nineveh relics (independent of Revelation) in\r\nregard to the history of the human race. There is no want of harmony\r\nbetween Scripture and Geology. The Word and the Works of God must\r\nbe in unison, and the more we truly study both, the more they will\r\nbe found to be in accordance. Any apparent want of correspondence\r\nproceeds either from imperfect interpretation of Scripture or from\r\nincomplete knowledge of science. The changes in the globe have all\r\npreceded man's appearance on the scene. He is the characteristic\r\nof the present epoch, and he knows by Revelation that the world is\r\nto undergo a further transformation, when the elements shall melt\r\nwith fervent heat, and when all the present state of things shall be\r\ndissolved, ere the ushering in of a new earth, wherein righteousness\r\nis to dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECAPITULATION._\r\n\r\n\r\nRecapitulation of the chief points connected with Fossil Botany:--\r\n\r\n  1. The vegetation of the globe has varied at different epochs of\r\n  the earth's history.\r\n\r\n  2. The farther we recede in geological history from the present\r\n  day, the greater is the difference between the fossil plants and\r\n  those which now occupy the surface.\r\n\r\n  3. All fossil plants may be referred to the great classes of\r\n  plants of the present day, Acotyledons, Monocotyledons, and\r\n  Dicotyledons.\r\n\r\n  4. The fossil species are different from those of the present\r\n  flora, and it is only when we reach the Tertiary periods that we\r\n  meet with some genera which are without doubt identical.\r\n\r\n  5. Fossil plants are preserved in various conditions, according\r\n  to the nature of their structure, and the mode in which they have\r\n  been acted upon. Sometimes mere casts of the plants are found, at\r\n  other times they are carbonised and converted into coal, while\r\n  at other times, besides being carbonised, they are infiltrated\r\n  with calcareous or siliceous matter, and finally, they may be\r\n  petrified.\r\n\r\n  6. Cellular plants, and the cellular portions of vascular plants,\r\n  have rarely been preserved, while woody species, and especially\r\n  Ferns, which are very indestructible, have retained their forms\r\n  in many instances.\r\n\r\n  7. In some cases, especially when silicified or charred, the\r\n  structure of the woody stems can be easily seen in thin sections\r\n  under the microscope.\r\n\r\n  8. The determination of fossil plants is a matter of great\r\n  difficulty, and requires a thorough knowledge of structure, and\r\n  of the markings on stems, roots, etc.\r\n\r\n  9. The rocks containing organic remains are called fossiliferous,\r\n  and are divided into Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary, or into\r\n  Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic, each of these series being\r\n  characterised by a peculiar facies of vegetable life.\r\n\r\n  10. The mere absence of organic remains will not always be a\r\n  correct guide as to the state of the globe.\r\n\r\n  11. The number of fossil species has been estimated at between\r\n  3000 and 4000; but many parts of plants are described as separate\r\n  species, and even genera, and hence the number is perhaps greater\r\n  than it ought to be.\r\n\r\n  12. Brongniart divides the fossil flora into three great\r\n  epochs:--1. The reign of Acrogens; 2. The reign of Gymnosperms;\r\n  3. The reign of Angiosperms.\r\n\r\n  13. The reign of Acrogens embraces the Silurian, Carboniferous,\r\n  and Permian epochs, in which there was a predominance of plants\r\n  belonging to the natural orders Filices, Lycopodiaceæ, and\r\n  Equisetaceæ, associated, however, with others of a higher class.\r\n\r\n  14. The reign of Gymnosperms embraces the lower and middle\r\n  Secondary periods, and is characterised by the presence of\r\n  numerous Coniferæ and Cycadaceæ.\r\n\r\n  15. The reign of Angiosperms includes the Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\n  periods, and is marked by the predominance of Angiospermous\r\n  Dicotyledons.\r\n\r\n  16. Coal is a vague term, referring to all kinds of fuel formed\r\n  from the chemically-altered remains of plants.\r\n\r\n  17. When there is a great admixture of mineral matter, so that it\r\n  will not burn as fuel, then a shale is produced.\r\n\r\n  18. The microscopic structure of Coal probably varies according\r\n  to the nature of the plants of which it is composed, and the\r\n  changes produced by pressure, heat, and other causes. Cellular\r\n  tissue, punctated woody tissue, and scalariform vessels, have\r\n  been detected in it.\r\n\r\n  19. Certain temporary and local floras seem to have given origin\r\n  to peculiar layers of coal.\r\n\r\n  20. During the Carboniferous epoch we meet with Ferns,\r\n  Sigillarias, and their roots called Stigmarias, Lepidodendrons,\r\n  Ulodendrons, Calamites, Gymnosperms, etc.\r\n\r\n  21. The plants forming coal have grown in the basin where the\r\n  coal is found; but sandstone rocks in the coal-measures deposited\r\n  by water having a considerable velocity, and consequently\r\n  carrying power, contain sometimes trunks of large trees which\r\n  have been drifted like snags.\r\n\r\n  22. The strata between the Permian epoch and Chalk display\r\n  numerous Gymnosperms, especially belonging to the Cycadaceous\r\n  Order. Some of them exhibit limited coal deposits.\r\n\r\n  23. The Chalk and Tertiary strata display not only Acrogens and\r\n  Gymnosperms, but also Angiospermous Dicotyledons, some of which,\r\n  at the Miocene period, belong apparently to genera of the present\r\n  day.\r\n\r\n  24. Brown Coal occurs in the Upper Tertiary beds, and in it\r\n  vegetable structure is easily seen under the microscope.\r\n\r\n  25. Raulin thinks that during the Tertiary epoch the flora of\r\n  Europe has gradually assumed a more temperate character.\r\n\r\n  26. The Eocene flora, according to Unger, resembled in many\r\n  respects that of Australia at the present day.\r\n\r\n  27. The Miocene flora is characterised by a number of exotic\r\n  forms of warm regions with those of temperate climates. It is\r\n  largely seen in the Arctic Regions.\r\n\r\n  28. The Pliocene flora has great analogy with that of the\r\n  temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WORKS ON FOSSIL BOTANY._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Fossil Botany the following works may be\r\nconsulted:--\r\n\r\n  Abhandlungen der Kaiserlich Königlichen Geologischen\r\n  Reichsanstalt, Band. ii.
