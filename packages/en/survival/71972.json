His views in some respects may be regarded as\r\nextreme, but on the whole they are characterized by strong common sense\r\nand are supported by a practical familiarity with all the phases of his\r\nsubject which should give them weight.\r\n\r\nThe Percheron horse no doubt stands first among the draft breeds of\r\nthe world. His value has been thoroughly tested in this country, and\r\nthe fact is established beyond a cavil that with careful breeding,\r\nand probably an occasional renewal by the importation of fresh blood,\r\nthe Percheron maintains his superior characteristics, and impresses\r\nthem upon his descendants of only one-quarter or one-eighth blood to\r\na very marked degree. The value of fast trotters, their encouragement\r\nby Agricultural Societies, and the enormous prices which have been\r\npaid for animals valuable simply for their speed as trotters, has no\r\ndoubt had a tendency to direct the aims of horse breeders in a wrong\r\ndirection. The result is, from whatever cause it comes, that the true\r\nhorse-of-all-work has been neglected. The Percheron, combining as he\r\ndoes a certain attractiveness of style, very free action, considerable\r\nspeed united to power, with astonishing strength for his weight,\r\nand the greatest kindness and docility, seems to offer to American\r\nhorse breeders an exceedingly useful animal, either to be maintained\r\ndistinct, or used for improving our stock of both light and heavy\r\ndraft-horses by crossings. The value of this work, however, does not\r\nconsist in its recommendation of this breed, or demonstration of its\r\nvalue in France, but its bold discussions of the principles of breeding\r\nas applied to the improvement of the Percherons, and equally applicable\r\nto that of other draft breeds, will doubtless commend themselves to the\r\ncareful consideration of breeders.\r\n\r\nInterest in the Percherons has increased greatly of late. Several\r\nnotable importations have been made, and excellent representatives of\r\nthis noble breed are to be found in the Eastern, Western, and Middle\r\nStates. The engravings which embellish this volume are portraits of\r\nanimals owned by Mr. W. T. Walters of Baltimore, Md., through whose\r\ninterest in this subject the Publishers were induced to issue this\r\ntranslation of M. Huÿs work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION, REARING, AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n    ... _Facilis descensus Averno;\r\n        Sed revocare gradum?_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost everything that has been written about the horse may be reduced\r\npretty much to,—complaining that there does not exist a breed which\r\nunites, in an elevated degree, high moral to physical qualities;\r\nmodestly seeking, and teaching the means of obtaining such a breed.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable that such sentiments should surprise us, here in\r\nthe heart of France, where, for a long time, a race of horses has\r\nflourished which may be said to fill the requirements proposed in every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this statement is easy: a hasty sketch of the principal\r\ncharacters of the breed suffices to furnish it.\r\n\r\nTo no ordinary strength, to vigor which does not degenerate, and to\r\na conformation which does not exclude elegance, it joins docility,\r\nmildness, patience, honesty, great kindness, excellent health, and a\r\nhardy, elastic temperament. Its movements are quick, spirited, and\r\nlight. It exhibits great endurance, both when hard worked, and when\r\nforced to maintain for a long time any of its natural gaits, and it\r\npossesses the inestimable quality of moving fast with heavy loads. It\r\nis particularly valuable for its astonishing precocity, and produces\r\nby its work, as a two-year-old, more than the cost of its feed and\r\nkeep. Indeed, it loves, and shows a real aptness for labor, which is\r\nthe lot of all. It knows neither the whims of bad humor, nor nervous\r\nexcitement. It bears for man, the companion of its labors, an innate\r\nconfidence, and expresses to him a gentle familiarity, the fruit of an\r\neducation for many generations in the midst of his family. Women and\r\nchildren from whose hands it is fed, can approach it without fear. In\r\na word, if I may dare speak thus, _it is an honorable race_. It has\r\nthat fine oriental gray coat, the best adapted of all to withstand\r\nthe burning rays of the sun in the midst of the fields—a coat which\r\npleases the eye, and which in the darkness of the night allowed the\r\npostilion of former times to see that he was not alone—that his friend\r\nwas making his way loyally before him. It is exempt, (a cause of\r\neverlasting jealousy among the breeders of other races,) always exempt\r\nfrom the hereditary bony defects of the hock, and where it is raised,\r\nspavin, jardon, bone spavin, periodical inflammation, and other dreaded\r\ninfirmities, are not known even by name.\r\n\r\nThis truly typical race would seem a myth did it not exist in our\r\nmidst. But every day we see, every day we handle this treasure,—the\r\nmunificent gift of Providence to this favored region, to cause\r\nagriculture, that “nursing mother,” to flourish, and with agriculture,\r\npeace and abundance.\r\n\r\nI need not name this breed; every one from this incomplete sketch\r\nhas recognized the fine race of steady and laborious horses, bred in\r\nthe ancient province of Perche, (so justly entitled _Perche of good\r\nhorses_,) plowing in long furrows the soil of Beauce, and thence\r\nspreading itself over all France, where its qualities render it without\r\na rival for all the specialties of rapid draft.\r\n\r\nHence it is that all our provinces envy us the possession of the race,\r\nand even foreign countries seek after it with an eagerness amounting to\r\na passion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERCULES.]\r\n\r\nThe breeder,—who is ordinarily a farmer, not sufficiently rich to be\r\nbeyond temptation,—finds himself without strength, without resistance\r\nin presence of this urgent demand. The finest types, not only of the\r\nmales, but of the females also, are disappearing every day.\r\n\r\nThis, tending incessantly to deprive Perche of that in which it is so\r\nsuperior, is so much more to be dreaded as the question of filling up\r\nthe vacancies and of saving this race from a tendency to degeneration\r\nand from inevitable destruction becomes the necessary corollary of such\r\ncommercial operations.\r\n\r\nEntered upon this course, if Perche does not adopt, without delay,\r\nsalutary measures, if it does not make a vigorous effort to place\r\nitself in a condition, either to resist the tendency or to contribute\r\nto it in a well-maintained and uniform manner, the breed is fated to a\r\ncomplete eclipse at the moment even when the future belongs to it.\r\n\r\nIndeed _the future_ does belong to the Percheron horse, if he can\r\nsustain himself in the first rank of the truly useful races until the\r\nnot far distant day when that era of triumph will come. Every thing now\r\nseems to incline to establish the truth of what, at first, appeared a\r\nparadox.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, for the moment, the Percheron has, in the class of\r\nfancy-horses, an antagonist that seems to derive formidable strength\r\nfrom the prestige belonging to elegance. The English thoroughbred\r\nand its congeners are in possession of the scepter of fashion and\r\n“_bon-ton_.” But this antagonism, more apparent than dangerous,\r\non account of the elevated but rather limited spheres in which it\r\nexists, will last but for a time, and will yield before reason and the\r\nnecessities of a difficult situation.\r\n\r\nOur age, factitious to excess, is governed by the demands and\r\ntemptations of a luxury which is tending to ruin the most solidly\r\nestablished families. It wildly suffers patrimonies and fortunes to\r\ndwindle away under the lead of a vain and noisy ostentation, without\r\nperceiving that already they are decreasing and becoming less every\r\nday, under the continued action of the laws. A change will be brought\r\nabout, and the effect of an inevitable reaction will be a return\r\ntowards sobriety and simplicity.\r\n\r\nRecovering from the intoxication of city luxury, the best minds will,\r\nlet us hope, recover their tone in the quiet of the fields, and\r\nagriculture will regain its too long forgotten rights. Tired out by\r\nallowing themselves to be eaten up by that elegant guest called the\r\nfancy-horse, and by the army of evil-doing satellites following in his\r\ntrain, men will come back to the one which requires but little care,\r\nand which returns good service, to the one which does not object to\r\nwork, the boon companion of every man desirous of following nature’s\r\nlaw, which is that of labor.\r\n\r\nThe value of the Percheron is more evident than ever. It is this, among\r\nthe serviceable races, which is called to the greatest fortune; for,\r\nof all the ordinary breeds, it is the nearest to the blooded, in shape\r\nand qualities. His usefulness causes him to be everywhere in demand.\r\nIf the railroads have driven him from the highway, they claim him as\r\nan auxiliary in the centers of population and at all their termini;\r\nfor he is eminently a trotter, remarkable for the ability to move at\r\na relatively rapid gait, and excelling in the valuable faculty of\r\nrapid draft. Since the post-coaches have ceased to use these horses,\r\nthe omnibuses of the large cities, and those communicating with the\r\nrailroads, require increasing numbers.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to seek for the means of improving the Percheron race and\r\nof maintaining it in its original purity and perfection in the land of\r\nits birth. But let us first see what is the origin of this race, what\r\ncountry gave it birth, and by what characters it is to be recognized.\r\n\r\nWe have, for this examination, borrowed largely of those who have known\r\nand studied Perche intimately, and hope to remain truthful in following\r\nthem step by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nGREATNESS AND DECLINE OF THE PERCHERONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGLANCE AT PERCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department of Perche is too well known to need a description here.\r\nWe will limit ourselves to the remark that this region, which has\r\nbecome so celebrated for its fine race of horses, represents an ellipse\r\nof about 25 leagues long by nearly 20 broad.\r\n\r\nThis ellipse is bounded on the north by Normandy; on the west, also by\r\nNormandy, and by Maine; on the east, by the portion of Beauce including\r\nChartrain and Dunois; on the south, by the Vendomois—three portions of\r\nthe ancient Orleanais.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, enclosed in the center of the four departments,\r\nOrne, Eure and Loir, Loir and Cher, and Sarthe, the territory of Perche\r\ncomprises the following divisions:\r\n\r\n_1st._—The district of Mortagne (department of Orne);\r\n\r\n_2nd._—The district of Nogent-le-Rotrou, and a portion of those of\r\nChartres, Dreux, and Chateaudun (department of Eure and Loir);\r\n\r\n_3rd._—All the western side of the district of Vendôme (department of\r\nLoir and Cher);\r\n\r\n_4th._—The eastern portion of the districts of Mamers and Saint Calais\r\n(department of Sarthe).\r\n\r\nIt is the summit region of the middle portion of the vast plateau\r\nextending between the sea and the basins of the Loire and the Seine.\r\nIt is here that the rivers Sarthe, Huisne, Eure, Loire, Iton, Höene,\r\nBraye, Avre, Commanche, and Percheron Orne, take their source,\r\nspringing up from the same plateau and crossing it on their way to the\r\nChannel and the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe country is, in general, uneven and hilly, cut up in every direction\r\nby small valleys watered by springs or small brooks flowing into the\r\nrivers above named. All these valleys, no matter of what extent, are\r\nnatural meadows, and the most of them rich and fertile. But drainage\r\ncould here be usefully applied everywhere, to rid them of their surplus\r\nhumidity, and to purge them of their too abundant aquatic plants. The\r\nfinest valley is that watered by the Huisne, which is second to none\r\nin France for length, extent, richness, and beauty of sites. Here are\r\nsituated Nogent-le-Rotrou, Condé, Regmalard, Boissy, Corbon, Mauves,\r\nPin-la-Garenne, Reveillon, etc., etc.,—all centers renowned for the\r\nbeauty of their horses.\r\n\r\nThe land is generally clayey, lying upon a calcareous subsoil of the\r\nsecondary formation. Some portions are silicious, the high and hilly\r\npoints always so.\r\n\r\nThe Percheron country contains rather few meadows, in proportion to\r\nthe total surface of the soil, and to this circumstance, probably, is\r\ndue the superiority of its horses. Here the rearing takes place in the\r\nstable and the brood-mare is found under the hand of the breeder. The\r\nidea of making use of her comes naturally to his mind. He works and\r\nfeeds her well. All the secret of his breeding lies in these few words.\r\n\r\nHere, for many years, agriculture has flourished; artificial meadows\r\nare everywhere cultivated with success, and are necessary to produce\r\nthe enormous quantity of fodder consumed by the number of horses raised.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants for green and dry forage, clover first and then\r\nfenugreek are the favorites of the Percheron farmer. He uses plaster\r\nand marl with care, and would tell you, should the opportunity offer,\r\nthat it is through system and superior cultivation that Perche has\r\nbeen able hitherto to meet the large demands made upon her from the\r\ncommencement of the present century, particularly for the last fifty\r\nyears. He is, moreover, laborious and persevering. Disregarding the\r\nindustrial arts, the glory of other districts, his true vocation, his\r\nfavorite occupation, is cultivating the ground and raising horses,\r\nwhich he has practised with zeal from the most remote period. In fact\r\ncannot this be inferred, even from the example of his early lords?\r\nThe Counts of Perche, those old Rotrous, triple knights, had they not\r\nadopted as an emblem of their nobility the stamp of their horses’\r\nfeet?... Not content with a single chevron, they placed three upon\r\ntheir standards, to signify both the superiority of their horses, and\r\ntheir infinite number. For in symbolical language (and none is more so\r\nthan that of heraldry,) the number three implies infinity; and the oval\r\nform of the eastern courser’s foot, to which the chevron is distinctly\r\ntraced, was used in early times as a sign of chivalry, replacing the\r\nancient ring of Rome. Hence comes, as a distinctive mark of nobility,\r\nthe large number of coats of arms with chevrons, among those of the\r\nknights. The simple chevron was the designation of the noble, and the\r\nparticular marks which often accompanied the chevron served to recall\r\nsome exploit, some distinguished feat of arms, the nature of the\r\ntastes, or the possessions of the warrior who bore this blazon.\r\n\r\nPerche is very much cut up: the farms generally small; the fields,\r\nlikewise small and mostly enclosed by hedges. The temper of the\r\nPercheron breeder is invariably mild. He knows all the importance of\r\nattention to the race which he rears, and nevertheless, it must be\r\nconfessed, that with the exception of the mildness with which he treats\r\nit, he has done next to nothing to ameliorate it or preserve it in its\r\nbeauty. Nature, time, and the climate, have done all.\r\n\r\nPerche has a climate eminently favorable to horse-breeding. Under its\r\ninfluence, the water is tonic and the food nutritious, the air is pure,\r\nbracing, and drier than that of Normandy. The sea is farther off, and\r\nits influence, in consequence, is less felt.\r\n\r\nHowever, these can be but general attributes, for the country varies\r\nin aspect according to the district. The portion near Normandy, which\r\nis watered by the Sarthe, is much the same as that province. The\r\ngrasses are, however, sparser, and especially do not have that extreme\r\nsweetness and great tonic quality which distinguish those of the\r\nenvirons of Courtomer and Merlerault, situated only a few leagues from\r\nthe limits of Perche.\r\n\r\nOn the side of Beauce, there are vast plains sometimes undulating, and\r\nhaving much similarity to that province.\r\n\r\nOn the Maine side, the country gradually assumes the characteristics of\r\naspect and cultivation peculiar to it, so that the transition between\r\nthese two provinces is not an abrupt change, but they blend like the\r\ntones of a picture. Upon some points woods, ponds in the north-east,\r\nforage and grain upon the remainder, are the chief features, and are\r\nthe sources of the revenues of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE PERCHERON RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe height of the Percheron horse is generally 14¾ to 16 hands; he\r\nis of a sanguine temperament, mixed in variable proportions with the\r\nmusculo-lymphatic; his color is almost always gray, and is, among the\r\ncharacteristic features, that which first strikes the eye.\r\n\r\nAccording to their predominence, these temperaments constitute\r\nvarieties which may be thus classed:\r\n\r\n_1st._—The light Percheron, in which the sanguine temperament\r\npredominates;\r\n\r\n_2nd._—The draft Percheron, in which the lymphatic temperament is the\r\nmost fully developed;\r\n\r\n_3rd._—The type intermediary between these two, partaking of the one by\r\nits lightness, and of the other by its muscular force.\r\n\r\nThe latter is the most numerous, but it has much degenerated of\r\nlate years; and there is a tendency to its disappearance since the\r\npost-coach service, which formed it, has gradually given way to\r\nother means of conveyance. It has style, although the head is rather\r\nlarge and long; nostrils well open and well dilated; eye large and\r\nexpressive; forehead broad; ear fine; neck rather short, but well\r\nfilled out; whithers high; shoulder pretty long and sloping; breast\r\nrather flat, but high and deep; a well-rounded body; back rather long;\r\nthe croup horizontal and muscular; tail attached high; short and\r\nstrong joints, and the tendon generally weak; a foot always excellent,\r\nalthough rather flat in the low countries and natural meadows; a gray\r\ncoat; fine skin; silky and abundant mane. Such are the most general\r\ncharacteristics of the old Percheron race. These are the points which\r\nare still noticed upon what remain of some old horses, preserved from\r\nthe transformation which commenced long ago; for at the present moment\r\neverything is much changed. Since the time of the foreign crossings,\r\nthe foot has become flatter, the head overcharged, the tendon still\r\nweaker, the back longer, the shoulder has lost its direction, and the\r\ncroup has become shorter. The race has changed suddenly to fill new\r\nwants which have unexpectedly sprung up.\r\n\r\nOf course these different characters are modified by the varieties\r\nupon which they are noticed, but the “_ensemble_” presents a striking\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\nThe light Percheron, suited to harness, is found particularly in\r\nthe Norman portion, in the district of Mortagne, near Courtomer,\r\nMoulins-la-Marche, Aigle, Mesle-sur-Sarthe, and especially in the\r\nparishes of Mesnière, Bures, and Champeaux-sur-Sarthe. This is easily\r\naccounted for, as here is the best blood of France, near the region\r\nwhere has been found the best Norman type. Here the soil, temperature,\r\nand pasturage, are pretty near the same.\r\n\r\nIn going from Nogent-le-Rotrou to Montdoubleau, and following the\r\nlimits of Perche-Manceau, by Saint-Calais, Vilvaye, Ferté-Bernard,\r\nSaint-Corme and Mamers, we travel over the birthplace of the heavy\r\ndraft-horse. Here we meet with the heavy brood-mares.\r\n\r\nIn the center of Perche, at Mauves, Regmalard, Lougny, Corbon,\r\nCourgeon, Reveillon, Villiers, and Saint-Langis, nothing is bred; the\r\nfarmer brings up the horse colts of Eperrais, Pin-la-Garenne, Coulimer,\r\nSaint-Quentin, Buré, Pervercheres and the breeding parishes of the\r\ndistrict of Mortagne, Nogent-le-Rotrou, Montdoubleau and Courtalain.\r\n\r\nHorses of different sexes and ages are never mingled in Perche; they\r\nare there separated with care. But it is not exactly the same in\r\nrespect to kinds.\r\n\r\nThe post-coach and the heavy-draft horse are there to be met with upon\r\nthe same ground. The post-coach horse is, to be sure, bred a little\r\neverywhere; his temperament and the conditions in which he is placed,\r\nprepare him for this specialty.\r\n\r\nIt is, as we see, at the two extremities of the ellipse (especially\r\nwhere the pasture grounds are), that the mares are found. In the\r\ncenter, at Mauves, Regmalard, Lougny, etc., etc., the inhabitants turn\r\ntheir attention to bringing up the colts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE PERCHERON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, now, is the origin of the Percheron? Some attribute to him\r\nan Arabian ancestry; others, less explicit and without positively\r\nassigning to him so noble an origin, hold him to be strongly\r\nimpregnated with Arabian blood. M. Eugene Perrault, one of the most\r\nextensive and skillful dealers in fancy horses in all Europe, has\r\nfrequently remarked to me that of all the various races of horses\r\nnone were so interesting to him as the admirable Percheron, and that,\r\njudging from his appearance and qualities, he was satisfied he was a\r\ngenuine Arab, modified in form by the climate and the rude services to\r\nwhich he had for ages been subjected.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, find in history the written positive proof that\r\nthe Percheron is an Arab, but we believe it easy, by fair historical\r\ndeduction, to prove what he is in fact.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that after the defeat of the famous Saracen chief\r\nAbderame by Charles Martel, on the plains of Vouille, the magnificent\r\ncavalry of the foe fell into the hands of the victors, since more than\r\n300,000 infidels were killed on that day, and the horses which they\r\nrode were, like themselves, from the East. Upon a division of the spoil\r\na large number of these were assigned to the men of La Perche, of\r\nOrleanais, and Normandy, who composed the bulk of the French forces,\r\nand they must necessarily have left in their progeny indelible traces\r\nof their blood.\r\n\r\nLa Perche, like all Christian countries, furnished, as is well known,\r\nher contingent of fighting men to the crusades, and the chronicles cite\r\nseveral Counts of Bellesmer, Mortagne, and Nogent, barons and gentlemen\r\nof that province, who, with many of their vassals, made pilgrimages to\r\nthe Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Faet, in a letter addressed to the Congress of Mortagne,\r\nJuly 16, 1843, and in his great work upon La Perche, cites in this\r\nconnection a lord of Montdoubleau, Geffroy IV., and Rotrou, Count of\r\nLa Perche, as having brought back from Palestine several stallions,\r\nwhich were put to mares, and the progeny most carefully preserved. The\r\nsmall number of the sires, their incomparable beauty, and manifest\r\nsuperiority, must have led to the _in-and-in_ breeding so much\r\ndeprecated by most breeders; but the qualities of the sires became\r\nindelibly fixed upon their progeny.\r\n\r\nThe lord of Montdoubleau was, it is said, the most zealous of the\r\nadvocates and breeders of the new blood, and, being the most zealous,\r\nwas the most successful; hence it is that the Montdoubleau stock is to\r\nthis day the best in Perche. The Count Roger, of Bellesmer, imported\r\nboth Arabian and Spanish horses, as did Goroze, the lord of Saint\r\nCerney, Courville, and Courseroult; these are historical facts which\r\nhave their importance. Like chronicles, it is true, exist for other\r\nprovinces—for Limousin, for Navarre, for Auvergne (the land of noble\r\nhorses), also for Brittany and Maine; but in the latter not the least\r\nsign of Eastern blood is perceptible. The fact is, the crusaders from\r\nall the French provinces naturally brought back with them more or\r\nless of the Eastern blood, which they had learned to appreciate on\r\nthe plains of Palestine—but the truth is, it has not been preserved\r\nelsewhere; and that we in La Perche, after so many centuries, should be\r\nso fortunate as to be able to show the traces of it, should stimulate\r\nus to its careful preservation.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Roman domination, the horse in his oriental forms\r\nwas not only valued by the Gauls, but was particularly prized in\r\nPerche. In 1861 a subterranean vault was discovered in the middle of a\r\nfield, near Jargeau (Loiret), upon the borders of Perche. It contained\r\na statue of Bacchus, surrounded by bacchanals, with which were found\r\na horse, a stag, a boar, some fish, a grape vine, and other native\r\nproducts of the country; but the horse was indubitably of the Arab\r\nform, which goes to prove, either that at that remote period there were\r\nArabians in the country, or that the native local race from which the\r\nportrait was taken resembled the Arabian.\r\n\r\nThese historical data, these inductions, incomplete as they may be,\r\nlead to the belief that for antiquity the Percheron yields to no\r\nother of our French races, and that the soil which has nourished and\r\npreserved it, must be one of the best in France for horse breeding.\r\n\r\nUnder the feudal rule and inhabited by tenants ever at war, Perche\r\nmust always have been an equestrian country, and the horse must have\r\nbeen there in every age the companion of man. He must have been really\r\na first class necessity. In those times of continued war and hostile\r\nsurprises, what property was more movable and so easily taken to a\r\nplace of safety? How glorious the possession of such noble coursers,\r\nand like the Rotrous, to own more than could be counted, as was proudly\r\nshown by the heraldic chevrons upon their broad banners, displayed from\r\nthe towers of Mortagne and Nogent!\r\n\r\nBut had the Percheron then, as a race, the characteristics it now\r\npossesses? This is not probable; it must have been lighter, but still\r\npossessing within itself the character which it now presents. The\r\nessential point is to prove that there was, at that period, a native\r\nrace; and if the extraordinary life formerly led there—if the aspect\r\nof the country, which must have been always fertile—if the historical\r\ninductions do not prove it—the universal tradition of the whole country\r\nshould not leave us in any doubt in respect to the fact.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, take no account of the silence of historians. This\r\nsilence is no proof of the non-existence of the Percheron. Most of\r\nthese writers were gentlemen of the equestrian order; they prized the\r\nsaddle-horse, while they ignored the equally useful breeds of all work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS OF THE PERCHERON RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Percheron race comes from the Arab; but it is useful to know the\r\ncauses which have separated it from the primitive type. How has it\r\nbeen modified? How has it lost the Arabian character, in which it\r\nmust have been at first clothed? A large number of the French races\r\nhave been even more profoundly modified, and have become abject,\r\nmiserable, puny, and misshapen. All equine races have been changed by\r\nthe effects of climate, by the extinction of the feudal system, and by\r\nthe inauguration of peaceful habits which have made an agricultural and\r\ndraft-horse of the horse primitively used for the saddle and for war.\r\nThe Percherons must have been especially modified by contact with the\r\nbreed of Brittany, where their striking characteristics are now met\r\nwith in a large number of individuals.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has been vigorously attempted to offset the intrusion of\r\nthe heavy horse by the continued use of the Arabian horse. Indeed, we\r\nsee, towards 1760, under the administration of the Marquis of Brigges,\r\nmanager of the stud-stables of Pin, all the large number of fine\r\nArabian, Barb, and eastern stallions, that this establishment owned,\r\nwere put at the disposition of the Count of Mallart for use at his\r\nmare-stables of Cóèsme, near Bellesme. The arrival of the Danish and\r\nEnglish stallions at the stud-stables of Pin put an unfortunate end to\r\nthe influence of the Arab horse in Perche, and it will now be many a\r\nlong year before the eastern blood will be seen as before. It is only\r\ntowards 1820, still at the same chateau of Cóèsme, with the grandsons\r\nof those old admirers of the Arabians, that we find again two Arab\r\nhorses from the stud-stables of Pin, _Godolphin_ and _Gallipoli_. These\r\ntwo valuable stock-getters, both gray, again gave tone and ardor to the\r\nPercheron race, and transformed definitely into gray horses the stock\r\nof the entire country, which had, it was said, become less uniform, and\r\nof all colors.\r\n\r\nThe Brittany horses have been strongly attracted towards Perche by the\r\nimmense outlet offered by the public service, since the increase of the\r\nroads, to the Percherons. Mixtures between the two races must have been\r\nfrequent. And when a good Brittany horse was there met with, he must\r\nhave been made use of, and the old native type has gradually tended to\r\ndisappear, and its traces become more and more rare. This mixture of\r\nPercheron and Brittany blood, too well marked to be questioned, arises\r\nfrom several causes, which we will take up successively in review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MODIFICATION, DUE TO CONTACT WITH THE BRITTANY RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerche is bounded, in its whole length, by the immense plains of\r\nBeauce. On account of this position, it was always traversed by the\r\npost-coaches for Paris, and by all the supplies that came from the West.\r\n\r\nBeing the intermediate point between the principal home of the Brittany\r\ndraft-horse and the immense markets which Beauce and Paris offered,\r\nits territory was the necessary stopping-place of everything that came\r\nfrom the West. It has been for many years the rendezvous of the draft\r\nraces of the whole West.\r\n\r\nNow, see in what an exceptional position this country is placed. First\r\nand foremost, I do not hesitate to say that there exists no French\r\nrace which could have multiplied and preserved its original type under\r\nsuch unhappy influences. We can but deplore the slight care taken in\r\npreserving it pure and intact, and the want of judgment in the delicate\r\noperation of crossing.\r\n\r\nThere has been no uniform and logical plan for improving as well as\r\nincreasing it. To make the greatest possible profit out of this hen\r\nwith the golden eggs has been the only aim.\r\n\r\nWhen the post-coaches, wagon transportation, and the public conveyances\r\nwere organized and generalized; when every thing requiring the use of\r\nthe horse had undergone excessive development; when the improvements of\r\nour roads, the multiplicity of business transactions, and the enormous\r\ninternal traffic, required increased and rapid locomotion, all eyes\r\nwere turned towards Perche, and it became necessary for her to satisfy\r\nthe increased demand.\r\n\r\nLet us see in what condition was the Percheron breeder to satisfy all\r\nthese demands. As for race, he possessed the best. Strong, yet quick,\r\nit was that, of all others, which contained the most blood. It owed\r\nthis to the soil and climate. It was the best to feed, the easiest to\r\nraise, and the most favorably situated to be cheaply multiplied. And\r\nwith all this, it had at its door the best of known markets.\r\n\r\nWagons, diligences, and post-coaches, required horses such as the\r\nPercheron cultivator loved to breed for himself. Hence that sympathetic\r\nunderstanding which developed itself more and more between the\r\nPercheron producer and the consumer occupied in public transportation.\r\nAnd the anxiety to meet the demand was one of the most active causes\r\nof degeneration and of the drafts made upon this and the neighboring\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALENE.—MARE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE BRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know how the sexes are divided in Perche; one section of the\r\nprovince produces, while another raises what the other has produced. No\r\nmatter what may be the class to which she belongs, light or heavy, or\r\npartaking of both, the mare is expected to breed every year. If barren,\r\nshe is sold, and this fault continuing, she passes into public use.\r\nDuring her gestation she works constantly. A few days of rest, before\r\nand after foaling, is the only time lost. The remainder of the time her\r\nwork pays abundantly for her keep and the interest on her cost.\r\n\r\nAt the age of five or six months, the colt is abruptly weaned and sold.\r\nIts price varies from five to six hundred francs—sometimes more, but\r\nthis is the exception—and so far it has cost nothing.\r\n\r\nLed into the interior upon the fertile meadows of Mauves, Pin,\r\nRegmalard, Corbon, Lougny, Reveillon, Courgeon, Saint-Langis, Villiers,\r\nCourgeoust, etc., etc., it remains one year unproductive. In winter it\r\nis fed upon hay, in the stable, and during the fine season turned into\r\nthe fields to graze. To sum up, it is rather poorly nourished on bran,\r\ngrass, and hay.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, it is as yet unproductive to its master, and it feels\r\nthe effects. Wait a little; its hardest time has gone by, and work will\r\nsoon soften its lot. It reaches, in this manner, the age of 15 or 18\r\nmonths. What has it cost for keeping? Very little. Estimate, about 80\r\nor 100 francs. At this age it is put to work. Naturally docile and in\r\nthe hands of a man always patient and mild, its training is generally\r\neasy. Assigned to farm labor, it plows or draws a wagon. Harnessed with\r\nfour or five colts of its own age, together they pull what would be an\r\neasy load for two good horses. Put before two oxen, or joined to three\r\nof its companions, it plows and is never overworked.\r\n\r\nNow, it is better fed, and taken a great deal better care of. Its\r\n“_morale_” improves, and its master seems to delight in contemplating\r\nthe progress and the development of its qualities. Thus, in traveling\r\nthrough Perche, one involuntarily stops in the midst of the fields to\r\nsee it work, never tired of admiring the vigor it displays, and the\r\ngentleness with which it is treated.\r\n\r\nThe bait is there. At the age of three the Beauce farmer buys it to\r\nwork his soft and light soil. For him, it must be preserved intact, its\r\ndevelopment uninjured, nay encouraged.\r\n\r\nMaster, servants, large and small, all deeply imbued with the love of\r\nthe horse, unite in this work with admirable skill.\r\n\r\nIt has thus worked during one year, abundantly fed, but receiving\r\nlittle or no grain. Doing enough light work to pay for its keep, the\r\nmaster has received, besides its manure, a heavy interest on the cost,\r\nas we will presently see.\r\n\r\nThis premature work, which would have been injurious under a careless\r\nmanagement, is, on the contrary, beneficial when it is in the hands of\r\na good master. This is so much the general case, that the contrary is\r\nthe exception. The animal grows and becomes better developed in size\r\nand strength.\r\n\r\nNow, as we before observed, the Beauce farmer comes to buy. He lives\r\nin a country of proverbial richness. The work there is abundant, but\r\nthe nature of the soil renders it extremely easy. The fields, very much\r\ndivided, and distant one from another, make a rapid gait indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn Beauce, the horse cannot be replaced as a beast of burden; no matter\r\nhow dear his keeping, his use is indispensable; the ox cannot be his\r\ncompetitor. But it is a fact of the greatest importance to state, that\r\nit is to the ox that the Percheron horse owes a part of his celebrity.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Beauce is the exceptional country for cereals; the\r\nhorse and sheep are pretty much the only animals which there produce\r\na manure required by such husbandry. Add to this the breadth of land\r\nunder tillage, and the extreme fertility of the soil, and the large\r\nnumber of horses kept by the Beauce farmer will be accounted for.\r\n\r\nAt three years old, the Percheron dealer sells his horse for 900 or\r\n1,000 francs, and sometimes more, according to his merit. But he does\r\nthis only in order to buy other colts; and the profit has been, in\r\nfact, sufficiently large to warrant him in this. He has had against him\r\nonly the chances of mortality. These are small; the race is tough and\r\nhardy. Accidents are more to be dreaded, and these sometimes occur.\r\nLiving in the open air, in the company of other animals, the young colt\r\nis a little exposed to the influences of chance. But the fields are\r\nenclosed, the master’s eye is upon it, and, to sum up all, the large\r\nprofit covers every thing.\r\n\r\nReaching Beauce at three years old, he is subjected to hard work. The\r\nwork is easy enough, but there is much of it. He must be quick, the\r\nbreadth of land is very extensive, and the work must be done. Sowing\r\nand harvesting—these two words sum up the Beauceron agriculture.\r\nOtherwise expressed—plowing and hauling. As regards the horse, all must\r\nbe done promptly and quickly.\r\n\r\nBut if he be hard worked, on the other hand, nothing is denied him.\r\nHe eats as much grain and hay as he pleases. What difference does\r\nthis make to the farmer? Do not his labor and his manure pay for his\r\nnourishment? And, moreover, how act otherwise? As we have seen, nothing\r\ncan supply his place. Necessity has no law.\r\n\r\nHe lives in this way a year, with abundant food. Sometimes he succumbs;\r\nthe mortality is quite large in this region. But the stock which\r\nremains after such a training offers many guaranties to the dealer\r\nwho buys it to transfer, if they suit, to the express and omnibus\r\ncompanies; or if they belong to the draft race, to the contractors,\r\nwagoners, and builders, of Paris. At five, he is bought by the\r\nhorse-dealer at the annual horse fair on St. Andrew’s Day in the town\r\nof Chartres. There he is delivered, the farmer leading his horse upon\r\nthe ground. The prices vary from 1,000 to 1,400 francs. The profit\r\nis small, sometimes nothing, the greatest gain being his work, which\r\ncannot be dispensed with. The feeble have perished; the survivors owe\r\ntheir lives only to their robust constitutions.\r\n\r\nBefore dedication to his final use, he has thus passed through four\r\nhands; all these have shared the risks of his rearing. The most serious\r\nhave been for the last owner; but he was also the wealthiest, and to\r\nhim also has he been the most useful.\r\n\r\nThus, we see, the foal costs almost nothing, and his work pays for his\r\nkeep. Perfectly well fed, and exercised from his tenderest age, the\r\nPercheron has always been the first draft-horse in the world, and he\r\nwould have constantly improved, if his admirable qualities themselves\r\nhad not led to his degeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE DEGENERACY OF THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breeding of the Percheron horse has been so much the more\r\nstimulated, in consequence of his situation, his well-known qualities,\r\nand the favorable economical circumstances in which he is placed.\r\n\r\nWas not everything in his favor? Sure and increasing sales and great\r\nfacility in raising?\r\n\r\nIn a word, Perche is not large; the number of horses that it can\r\nproduce is limited, and not being able to answer all the demands made\r\nupon it, competition stepped in.\r\n\r\nAt first, the finest types, the males especially, were sold. Then,\r\nlittle by little, the traffic increasing, the finest females, in their\r\nturn, commenced to appear upon the market.\r\n\r\nThe interior of France and foreign countries, Prussia especially, were\r\nanxious to possess them, the latter country, in order to form a race\r\nof draft-horses, which it absolutely needed, in consequence its own\r\nbecoming too light.\r\n\r\nIt is the only race which has been accused of no faults,—simply because\r\nit has satisfied a real want and has been able to satisfy it fully.\r\n\r\nThe sale of colts becoming greater and greater, and all the farmers\r\nbeing interested in buying them to raise, Brittany sent hers upon the\r\nmarkets. They made their appearance in Perche and in the fairs of\r\nMortagne, Courtalain, etc., etc., taking their place there alongside\r\nthe colts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe breeding-mares being sought after, and in consequence sold, it\r\nbecame necessary to replace them. Their offspring sold too well not to\r\nthink of increasing their number. Hence the introduction, at first, of\r\na large number of Brittany mares, and afterwards of mares from Caux,\r\nPicardy, etc., etc., approaching nearest, both as to height and coat,\r\nto the race of the country.\r\n\r\nIf there had been among them only the Brittany mares, I would but half\r\ncomplain: these are well bred; and moreover, has not Perche contributed\r\nto the improvement of the Brittany race by sending into their country\r\nsuch famous stallions as _Pomme_, _Bijou_, and _Tancrede_? But the\r\nmares from Picardy, from Caux and from Boulogne—the scrofulous races of\r\nthe North! What can be said for them?\r\n\r\nThis introduction is not of yesterday; it is already of long date. But\r\nit may be boldly advanced that it is only since 1830 that it has been\r\neffected upon a very large scale. 1830 was the era of the systematic\r\ninfusion of the English pure-blood into our French half-blood races.\r\nHaving become, by this fact, less fit for service, they commenced to\r\nlose their credit in the eyes of thinking men. The rich ran after\r\nthe English, while others wanted the German horse, and this made the\r\nlatter’s fortune. The majority addressed themselves to Perche, and thus\r\nobliged her to multiply anew a stock already become insufficient.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Perche, that is to say, towards the Norman part, in the\r\ndistrict of Mortagne, the introduction, (we are ignorant of its\r\ncause,—perhaps from the presence of some good stallions,) was not\r\nso great; but it did, nevertheless, take place, and its traces\r\nare discovered at every step. It would be very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to find there at the present moment, a Percheron completely\r\nfree from mixture of foreign blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSTARTING POINT OF THIS DEGENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as the post-coaches were flourishing and the diligences\r\ncrossing France in every direction, it was especially a horse fit for\r\ntheir uses that Perche devoted itself to produce. But since these\r\nmodes of transportation have been modified, the race, with them, has\r\nundergone a complete transformation. As this country only possessed, as\r\nan outlet for the light part of its stock, the expresses, omnibuses,\r\nand post-office services in the interior of Paris, and later the\r\nprivate post teams, etc., etc., which only employ quick-gaited\r\nhorses, it became necessary to think of rendering the race heavier,\r\nin order to replace the monopoly of the mail stages and diligences by\r\nanother monopoly. Had it not before it the necessity of satisfying\r\nthe commercial wants—that is to say, the express cartage, the heavy\r\nwork of the contractors and builders of Paris, and in the provinces,\r\nthe services of the large towns, and the express and other business\r\nconnected with all railroads? The fear of losing this important market\r\noffered to his qualities of speed, strength, and honesty, tempted the\r\nbreeder to infuse too suddenly the blood of the heavy draft-horse. He\r\nmight have accomplished this more slowly and gradually, by means of a\r\nrational coupling with the heaviest bodied native types; but our age,\r\neager to enjoy, did not leave him the time. To answer to these new\r\nwants, Perche opened wide its doors to all the heavy mares that it\r\ncould meet with. Many came from Brittany, others from Picardy and Caux,\r\nand some from Boulogne. During this time the ancient stallion of the\r\ncountry, eagerly sought after by all those who wished to create fine\r\ndraft studs, passed into the interior and even into foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Percheron race was very great. All the departments\r\nwished to acclimate it. The prices of these stallions had increased\r\nso rapidly in a few years, that they had tripled and quadrupled.\r\nAccordingly, the possessors sold them. The administrative authorities,\r\naided by the élite of the proprietors, endeavored, however, to hinder\r\nthis emigration. They formed a stud-stable at Bonneval; but this\r\nestablishment was not composed of types that were homogeneous and\r\nadapted to assure a regular and continuous improvement. Prizes were\r\ngiven at Mortagne, Nogent-le-Rotrou, Illiers, and Vendôme. But an end\r\nwas arrived at contrary to what was desired. The prizes served as\r\nsigns to the dealers. Perche was visited to buy first-class horses.\r\nWhat surer guaranty than the prize? And then, how could the breeders\r\nresist the prices of 3,000 and 4,000 francs, and even more, offered the\r\nproprietor of a stallion?\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that these stallions, before disappearing, had\r\nalready served; I know this. But how served? They had served at two or\r\nthree years, before their complete development, and it was at the age\r\nat which they would have been most useful, that they were withdrawn\r\nfrom their district, and the same thing was true with the best mares.\r\n\r\nSeveral departments carried off great numbers; they were sent\r\neverywhere. A great many proprietors bought them. Thus disappeared,\r\ngradually, the flower of the breeding-mares. The race was cut off in\r\nits prime. Perche stretched its sails to the winds of the present\r\nwithout thinking of the future!\r\n\r\nStallions of all kinds now came forward; stallions from Brittany,\r\nPicardy, Caux, and Boulogne. The heaviest were preferred. The change\r\nwas so rapid, that, to-day, in many places, there does not remain the\r\nslightest trace of genuine Percheron blood. It is a mixture which\r\nbetrays itself to the eye by coarse forms, foreign to the original\r\ntype, and in the _morale_ by a sensible loss of that generous spirit,\r\nand of that indescribable something that we so much admired. Perche\r\nwould formerly have disowned stock lacking the eastern character;\r\nstill, their presence is not without instruction. It gives the measure\r\nof the great climatic qualities of this province, and proves what it\r\ncould have done with well-chosen animals.\r\n\r\nSuch is its force of assimilation, that after nourishing some\r\ngenerations upon its soil, it is able to reform them, and impart that\r\nsacred fire, and that build, which can only come from the nourishment\r\nof its hills.\r\n\r\nThe department authorities, unwearied by the slight success of their\r\nfirst attempts, renew their efforts, from year to year, to oppose\r\nthe progress of this degeneration, and endeavor to combat it by the\r\nstrongest measures.\r\n\r\nThe department of Eure and Loir, undeterred by the costly and\r\ndisastrous failure of the Bonneval breeding stud, continues still its\r\npatriotic work, and keeps up its encouragements, in the form of prizes\r\nto stallions and brood-mares—encouragements to which Orne and Loir, and\r\nCher, appropriate annually considerable sums.\r\n\r\nThere was formed, some years ago, at Chateaudun, with the most\r\ndisinterested and patriotic design, a powerful association of\r\nproprietors, known under the name of “_The Horse Association of\r\nPerche_,” having for its mission the furnishing of good stallions to\r\nthe farmers.\r\n\r\nTrotting matches at Illiers, Courtalain, Vendôme, Montdoubleau, and\r\nMortagne, have been established; but, with all this, a success worthy\r\nof such efforts has not yet been obtained, on account of a lack of\r\nuniformity in the movement.\r\n\r\nCompetition at the fairs gives but too often the spectacle of _size_\r\nbeing systematically encouraged; while trotting, in consequence of the\r\nspeed required, leads to the employment of English cross-breds. Would\r\nthis operation were well directed! But even then, would this English\r\nblood be used in right proportions? I doubt it. When it is used, it\r\nis used too much; for, this blood, if it be not employed with extreme\r\nreserve, an extreme parsimony, if I may so speak, results in injuring\r\nthe honest traits and the valuable quality of early maturity; it\r\ndestroys, in fact, that precocity of the breed, which enables it at an\r\nearly age to pay for its feed by its labor. The breeders are almost\r\ninvariably small farmers, and they cannot afford to lose the time\r\nnecessary to mature fancy horses; they must have quick sales and quick\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nOF THE MEANS OF REGENERATING THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nPerche, in order to retain its best customers, and not drop to a level\r\nwith the common herd of horse-breeders, must at once have recourse to\r\nsystematic means of improvement. Her breeders have shown a deplorable\r\nalacrity in the downward course, which has brought upon them the\r\ndepreciation in the value of their stock, of which they begin to\r\nperceive the effects.\r\n\r\n    “Facilis descensus Averno;\r\n    Sed revocare gradum,\r\n    Hoc opus, hic labor est!”\r\n\r\nUnanimity of will and unity of means are both necessary to accomplish\r\nthe ascent, and regain the position which the breed has lost. Two\r\nmeasures present themselves as each essential in accomplishing this\r\nresult. The first step is to restore the disturbed equilibrium by a\r\nwell-planned and uninterrupted series of crosses, effected within\r\nthe breed. This would arrest the evil. The second step should be,\r\nsubsequently, to breed up by improving crosses, practised with a wise\r\nand circumspect deliberation. This would be making progress.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, and continued parallel with this course of\r\nbreeding, a _Stud-book_ should be instituted, in order that all thus\r\nsubjected to systematic improvement should be brought together, and\r\nthus initiate a general improvement of the breed. The development of\r\nthese ideas will furnish matter for the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nREGENERATION OF THE PERCHERON BREED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of crossing applicable to any breed, both of which\r\nhave had their earnest partisans. So much clamor has been made about\r\nthem, I think, only because they have been simultaneously used and\r\noften mingled, and the results have been deranged by their use. This\r\nmight have been avoided by commencing with the simplest and continuing\r\nwith the best.\r\n\r\nThe first may be called the renewal of a breed within itself, or\r\ninterbreeding; the second, improving by foreign blood. We will pass\r\nthem rapidly in review, trying to reach in the results the solid basis\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nREGENERATION OF THE BREED THROUGH ITSELF, OR BY SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first manner, also called _selection_, consists in making, among\r\nthe race itself, a rational, judicious choice of the most perfect\r\ntypes; those which are as free as possible from the most prominent\r\ndefects of the breed; those which best recall the primitive type, if it\r\npossess the superior qualities which it is required to reproduce; those\r\nwhich, healthy and vigorous, seem to have among themselves the most\r\naffinity. This choice ought to be severe and rigorous, nor should we be\r\ndiscouraged by the small number of the elect.\r\n\r\nFrom the issue of this first selection, make a similar choice, and with\r\nthem and their progeny march perseveringly in the same way, without\r\never looking to the right or to the left—that is to say, without\r\never listening to advice which would modify the work commenced, or\r\nto praises which might induce the desire for too rapid results. To\r\nproceed too fast is perhaps a still greater error than to stop on the\r\nway, inasmuch as it often renders a retrograde movement obligatory and\r\nreduces to nothing the results of several years of success.\r\n\r\nIt is indispensable that the selections from which a good progeny is\r\ndesired should be completely grown—that is to say, the horses should be\r\nat least four years past, and the mares fully three years old.\r\n\r\nSell, without remorse, to the trade the least successful types,\r\nand most carefully keep the good. The horses, after serving some\r\ncampaigns in their adult age, can be sold without inconvenience; a few\r\nwell-proved types are sufficient for a district. But never part with\r\nthe mares when they are remarkable for their conformation, temper,\r\naptitude to work, and for their qualities as breeders.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to keep the breeders clear of temptations which are\r\nalways dangerous, and as a good means of guidance, prizes become a\r\nquestion of life or death for the future of the race. It is, in fact,\r\nby means of prizes and rewards, liberally distributed for the class of\r\nmares of three to ten years inclusively, that they can be kept in the\r\nregion. It is by awarding the prize at three years, after they have\r\nbeen covered, in paying at first but one-half of the prize and the\r\nremainder only after they have foaled and have been again covered, that\r\nthey can be virtually controlled. After ten years, as they no longer\r\nmeet with either a good or profitable sale, special encouragement\r\nmay cease. Moreover, the breeder who during eight years has received\r\nin prizes a sum often superior to the money value of his mare, and\r\nrecognizing that he possesses in her a brood-mare of merit, will no\r\nlonger commit the folly of parting with her for a price which would be\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nThere is such extreme delicacy in the manner of distributing these\r\nprizes, that I scarcely dare refer to it.\r\n\r\nThe members of the council-board, who have the appropriation for the\r\nprizes, should have naturally and rightfully the honor of awarding\r\nthem. I would then wish, that in each district (what I am about to say\r\nexcludes the public fairs, in which a jury, numerous, and consequently\r\nnever unanimous in opinion, opposes the execution of a uniform idea),\r\nthe council-board and the council of the district, charged at the\r\nsame time with the establishment of the _Stud-book_, of which I will\r\nspeak in a separate chapter, should be willing to accept this mission,\r\nwhich they would perform with the aid of the inspector-general of the\r\nStud-stables. Each year, by their care, the mares of a district would\r\nbe scrupulously examined and classed for the prize.\r\n\r\nThese premiums should be granted for eight years, to the best\r\nthree-year-old fillies, to which this distinction would give the\r\nentrance upon the _Stud-book_. In the first year of the establishment\r\nof this book, destined to contain the genealogical documents relative\r\nto the celebrities of the race, the mares above three years, which have\r\nbeen found worthy to be inscribed, should be likewise given prizes,\r\nand this same should be allowed them as a pension up to the age of ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThese inducements should be annual, and kept up as long as the\r\nprize-mare is kept as a breeder and in proper condition, that is to\r\nsay, sound of wind, and exempt from the glanders. Other blemishes, the\r\nnatural consequence of work and age, might be tolerated.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same system and conditions, similar prizes should be\r\nawarded to stallions, without paying attention to rewards which they\r\nmay have received from other quarters. But as the resources of which\r\na department disposes, augmented even by private contributions, are\r\nnot inexhaustible, it is urgent that the prizes, always liberal and\r\nremunerative, being from two to four hundred francs for mares, and from\r\nfour to eight hundred francs for stallions, should be accorded only to\r\nspecimens of real merit. Quality, when it effects the regeneration of a\r\nrace, is always preferable to quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is, especially, necessary to excite earnest breeders by all possible\r\nmeans, to preserve or to buy remarkable Percherons, presenting in their\r\nform and character the type of the stallion. And, if the prizes of four\r\nto eight hundred francs, of which we have just asked the institution,\r\nshould not appear to the authorities of the departments a sufficient\r\nmeans to impart the necessary impulse for the complete success of this\r\nmeasure, the departments might themselves buy some remarkable types,\r\nand either use them, themselves, in gratuitously serving the finest\r\nmares, or in confiding them to good farmers, in whose hands they would\r\nbe given the prize and used almost for nothing, as long as their health\r\npermitted them to be profitably kept. After a certain number of years\r\nthese stallions might even become the property of their keepers, or\r\nthey might, from the beginning, be granted them at reduced prices, with\r\nthe obligation, on the one side, that they should be used with judgment\r\nand preserved with care, and on the other side, with the promise of\r\na largely remunerative prize. Love of gain has driven the peasant to\r\nstrip himself of everything he owned that was good; it now belongs to\r\nthe authorities, by the incentive of gain, to induce this same peasant\r\nto pursue a wiser course.\r\n\r\nOppose as much as possible the use of stallions before fully four years\r\nold, and the fillies being put to breeding before reaching their third\r\nyear. This can only be attained by giving the prize, in the class of\r\nfillies, to such as have been served at the age of three years, by\r\nstallions of at least four years old.\r\n\r\nCrossing by selection has numerous advocates, and from all time,\r\nthe best-informed, the most practical men, have been unanimous in\r\nproclaiming that _blood is only preserved and improved by blood_—that\r\nis to say, by selection. It is easy and not expensive, inasmuch as the\r\nnecessary subjects are always at hand; it is natural, inasmuch as its\r\nsimplicity is apparent to every mind. And, if it does not bring the\r\nrapid results so pleasing to those too eager for profit, it is, at\r\nleast, always sure. For, without giving at first exceptional results,\r\nit never fails in its effects, by reason of the affinity existing\r\nbetween the different individuals, and by reason especially of their\r\nperfect conformity with the climate and soil. In fact, this conformity\r\nis not an indifferent matter, and it has been found by experience\r\nthat animals, noted upon their native soil for their sureness in\r\nreproducing, and for the invariable transmission of their qualities to\r\ntheir descendants, frequently fail in these respects when imported into\r\nanother country. Often, several years roll by before they recover that\r\nequilibrium of health and that tranquillity of animal functions, which\r\npermit them to reproduce in a sure, equal, and fixed manner, without\r\nwhich an improvement in the type cannot take place.\r\n\r\nSelection has long been practiced in Perche, and it has there produced\r\nfor a long time the best results, which were interfered with only\r\nby the importation from Picardy, Caux, and Boulogne, of animals of\r\ninferior blood.\r\n\r\nAmong the bovine species, we have curious examples of the value of\r\nselection, especially those furnished in Cotentin, where a breed exists\r\nthe finest, best, and the most sought after in France. Crossing with\r\nforeign blood, which fashion, at one date or another, had wished to\r\nprescribe, has always been forbidden as a crime in this country. It is\r\nthus that the finest herds of La Manche, and especially those of M.\r\nMannoury of Canisy near Saint-Lô have been formed. The success of this\r\nbreeder began at Ebisey near Caen, where he commenced a few years ago\r\nand where the stock can be easily examined.\r\n\r\nA bull of the Cotentin race, the most perfect and best bred that could\r\nbe found, put to heifers of the same breed, chosen among the finest\r\ntypes, was the starting point officially recorded. Selection, operating\r\nupon this progeny, as it had operated in the beginning, was continued\r\nwithout intermission, and, by these means it has produced a herd all\r\nthe members of which are alike and constantly transmitting identical\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONSANGUINITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nConjugal consanguinity has neither partisans nor friends. The\r\nphysiologist, physician, priest, and legislator, have always launched\r\nagainst it the same anathema. All, in making war against it, knew\r\nthat it was the surest method of establishing a fixed and permanent\r\nrace; but, all, preoccupied in seeking a means of universal fusion,\r\nthought they had found in the prohibition of this a leveler destined to\r\nequalize everything.\r\n\r\nIt was feared that certain families would become too individualized,\r\ntoo marked in their tendencies; and all, without acknowledging it,\r\nendeavored to close a way which might lead to the engrossment of\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nClose interbreeding, in the horse, has not the same political\r\ninconveniences; this is clearly apparent; but with us, the desire to\r\nlegislate upon and regulate everything, reducing all to a common level,\r\nhas prevailed. Equine consanguinity has not, any more than the other,\r\nfound favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTHONY.]\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, strikes any one at the outset who has studied the\r\nequine races, followed, step by step, their progeny, and made himself\r\nacquainted with their performances. This fact is:\r\n\r\nIf a horse is remarkable over all others in one of the three following\r\nways: personal beauty, high qualities, or sureness of reproduction; go\r\nback boldly to his origin, and you will find yourself, at each step,\r\nface to face with close interbreeding—that is to say, the reforming of\r\na race by means of itself, the result of great qualities increased by\r\ndrafts made at the source of a generous blood.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughbred race in England, which has been formed but with a\r\nvery limited number of primitive agents, and which, consequently,\r\nsoon became consanguine, has anew, and at two distinct epochs,\r\nabsorbed in every degree and repeatedly the blood of two famous\r\ngroups, represented, the first by _Byerly Turk_, _Darley Arabian_, and\r\n_Godolphin Arabian_; the second, by _Matchem_, _Herod_, and _Eclipse_.\r\nAt the present moment, it maintains itself, thanks to a universal\r\nconsanguinity, and everything good which exists, by going back\r\ninevitably to these sole progenitors, now forms but one and the same\r\nfamily. Magnificent results have come from these alliances, and every\r\nday it can be proved that this blood has not degenerated.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in all breeding countries, and it has been shown, (for\r\nproofs see the journal “_La vie à la campagne_”, of the 30th November,\r\n1863), that especially in Merlerault, the nursery of the fine French\r\nbreeds, everything exceptionally good which exists, or which has\r\nexisted, is the result of consanguinity—that is, “in-and-in breeding.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the conclusion of the author of this note:\r\n\r\nThese examples (the pedigrees of the best horses), collected with\r\ncare, will perhaps bring upon me the accusation of being a partisan\r\nof in-and-in breeding. In principle, I condemn its absolute use;\r\nbut, within certain limits, I admit and advise it, especially in the\r\ncommencement, when it becomes a question of founding and establishing\r\na family designed to exercise a permanent influence upon the future\r\nimprovement of a region.\r\n\r\nUniting together vices of conformation, character, and temperament,\r\nis rendering them indelible for ever. Uniting quality, beauty, and\r\naptitude, it is preserving the monopoly of these in a single family.\r\n\r\nHence, I would like, when there appeared, on the turf or elsewhere, one\r\nof those envied types of which nature is generally so sparing, that\r\njudicious attempts, made with patience, should fix the qualities so apt\r\nto disappear, and collect, so to speak, all the sources whence they\r\nemanate.\r\n\r\nThe brothers, sisters, and collaterals, should be included, but once\r\nonly, in these crossings, which might even go back, if it were still\r\ntime, as far as the grandsires and dams, on account of the resemblance\r\nnoticed between ancestors and their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nFinally, the truly valuable and completely successful results of a\r\nfamily thus strengthened should be coupled according to the rules of\r\nintelligent crossing to the equally confirmed representatives of some\r\nother excellent family, fit to form new offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOUGHT THE GRAY COLOR OF THE PERCHERON TO BE INFLEXIBLY MAINTAINED?\r\n\r\n\r\nFormerly I liked the gray horse very much, and have more than once\r\npraised this color. But time has dissipated my illusions.\r\n\r\nThus, while acknowledging my former preferences for the gray horse\r\nover the horse of a different shade, I am now very far from showing\r\nmyself exclusive, and quarreling with the mass of enlightened persons\r\nwho seem desirous of adopting the dark colored coats. I only desire\r\none thing, and that is to save the Percheron race, and to preserve to\r\nPerche its prosperity and its glory.\r\n\r\nIf I have liked the gray horse, it was from conviction, and not to\r\ncourt those who saw no safety outside the gray. But when the wisdom and\r\nthe extreme intelligence of masters of science, preferring a less showy\r\ncolor, demonstrated to me that Perche might find an era of new glory\r\nand prosperity in changing the coat of its horse and thus enlarging\r\nthe circle of consumption, I bowed meekly to their opinion. I liked\r\nthe gray horse because I thought that Providence had created it gray\r\nin order that it might be able to withstand, during its work, the heat\r\nof the sun, and not be prostrated under its rays. I liked it gray, as\r\nthe Arab likes his horse gray and his bournous of a whitish color; as\r\nthe American planter likes his white cotton suit and his panama; as our\r\nsoldier, in the field, liked, under the African or Mexican sky, the\r\nhavelock which protected him against the rays of the burning luminary.\r\nI liked it gray because it seemed to me to recall more than any other\r\nthe Arab, the primitive horse; because Perche having always possessed\r\ngray horses, I thought there was much more chance of finding, under\r\nthis coat, the type of the country; because I had been rocked to sleep\r\nto the tune of that old ballad of our ancestors, celebrating Charles de\r\nTrie, the Percheron Seigneur, going forth to combat the English at the\r\nbattle of Poitiers:\r\n\r\n    “On charger white\r\n     The sire of Trie\r\n     Against the foe\r\n     Has gone to war,” etc. etc.;\r\n\r\nbecause, in a word, during my infancy, I had breathed the dust of the\r\nold manuscripts making mention of the white Percheron mares. I liked\r\nit gray, because, for the service of the post-coaches and couriers, in\r\ntheir long stages, in the middle of the night, the gray horse appeared\r\nto me more easy to guide than the horse of a dark color. Finally, it\r\nhas always seemed to me that this coat was more becoming than any\r\nother the powerful form of a vigorous worker. Does not a good-looking,\r\nstalwart, and honest peasant please you better—is he not infinitely\r\nmore at ease with the Gallic blouse covering his broad shoulders, than\r\nunder the dark folds of a fashionable coat, which makes him appear\r\nawkward and abashed?\r\n\r\nBut everything is much changed. The country has no longer any special\r\ntype in the midst of all this gray amalgamated with Brittany, Picardy,\r\nand Caux, of which the equine stock of Perche is now composed. If the\r\nPercheron should cease to be bound by this law of gray, if he should\r\nbecome of all shades, at the same time remaining good, and such as\r\nPerche knows how to make him, he would cease to be dishonored by those\r\neverlasting plagiarists, shamelessly calling themselves Percherons\r\nbecause they happen to be gray and have travelled across the Perche\r\ncountry. If he should become of all shades, in preserving the qualities\r\nand movement which are a feature of everything that the tonic grasses\r\nand the fine and vivifying air of Perche produces, he would not be\r\nreduced to the simple role of furnishing the 6,000 or 7,000 horses\r\nthat the omnibuses and teamsters each year require, plus the 600 or\r\n700 typical ones that foreign countries demand of Perche. He might,\r\nlittle by little, contribute to the satisfaction of the half-fancy and\r\nto the wants of the hunting and army equipages; he might advantageously\r\nreplace the German horse, which we are obliged to employ in want of a\r\nbetter. Post-coaches no longer existing, there is no longer need of\r\ngray horses for the night in the midst of the darkness of the highways.\r\nSteam machinery, the indispensable substitute for the lack of human\r\nhands in the country, being destined to execute, in part, the labors\r\nof agriculture, the horse will be less employed there, and the one\r\nthat will be called for, having fewer difficulties to overcome, can be\r\nlighter, more _distingué_, faster, and more fit for adaptation to the\r\nexigences of trade and fashion.—Finally, Fashion wishing, positively,\r\nno more gray horses, and the Percheron finding no longer a sufficient\r\nemployment in the omnibuses, will soon find himself in a tight place if\r\nhe do not take a fresh start, and make himself acceptable—if he do not\r\nconform to the exactions of the age, and become more stylish and darker\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\nIt is settled, then, that he must put upon his back a less showy\r\ncovering; but he can only do this on condition that he become, thanks\r\nto good crossings, more presentable and have a more stylish air. And,\r\nreally, what is more ridiculous than a vulgar and common beast decked\r\nout with the livery of the fancy and private horse!\r\n\r\nLet us occupy ourselves, then, seriously in looking up breeding stock\r\nof dark coats; the time to do this appears to me to have come. But\r\nwhere will we go to find them? Let us look about us and seek for this\r\nin Perche.\r\n\r\nIf you there find, under a dark coat, a fine Percheron, possessing all\r\nthe qualities and specialties of the race, make haste, take him and\r\ncolor your horses. Sincerely, I give you this advice. Still, as in the\r\npresent state of things, it is rare that the fine and the somber are\r\nmet with together among the working races, by reason of the horror\r\nwhich has been professed, up to the present moment, for everything not\r\ngray, the best expedient would be to color the coat by means of fine,\r\ndark skin Arabs, or with good, well-chosen Norfolks, a subject that we\r\nwill treat upon in the chapter of crossings. As to doing it otherwise,\r\nit is not to be thought of, the elements not existing in Perche.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is only a minor matter. The essential point is to unite\r\nthe heavy to the _distingué_, weight to gait, mildness to vigor,\r\nhardiness to energetic temperament, steadiness and precocity; in a\r\nword, to repeat myself for the hundredth time, add a little more dash\r\nand style. Correct the defects of conformation, the imperfections\r\nof color, without weakening, without breaking up the harmony of the\r\nadmirable qualities which have made of the Percheron the first horse of\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE PURE, AND WITHOUT INTERMIXTURE, THE THREE TYPES OF THE\r\nPERCHERON RACE—THE LIGHT HORSE, THE DRAFT HORSE, THE INTERMEDIATE HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have spoken, in Chapter II, Part First, of the three types which\r\nthe Percheron race presents—the light horse, the draft horse, and the\r\nintermediate or post horse. These three breeds come of the soil and\r\nare the product of ancient crosses. There is reason for their existing\r\nand for their marked peculiarities; and reason requires, then, that\r\nthey should be preserved, and, in maintaining them always in their\r\nproper functions, we obey, in that progressive spirit which urges us\r\nto embellish everything. The first is destined to become the post\r\nhorse and horse for private use, the surest and most agreeable means\r\nof locomotion. The second cannot be replaced for express carting, and\r\nfor the builders and contractors of Paris and other large towns. To\r\nthe third, the omnibuses always offer a steady market. Consequently,\r\nit is important to keep them without intermixture and to continue them\r\nuninterruptedly each in its respective class. Hence in seeking to add\r\nweight to a class it is necessary to avoid crossing it with a race\r\nsuperior in height, and different in conformation and temperament.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest and strongest of a class, united among themselves, will\r\nproduce more surely the kind demanded than a too precipitate crossing.\r\nNothing is more risky than crosses made without judgment. It is by them\r\nthat harmony of form is destroyed, and a degenerate mongrel race is\r\nproduced as the inevitable consequence. It is then important, in the\r\nreunion of types, never to lose sight of equality and similarity of\r\nconformation and qualities. But, at the same time, it is necessary to\r\nmarch with the age, study its tendencies, and be always ready to guide\r\na movement which otherwise might drag you in its wake.\r\n\r\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that the services required of the\r\nPercheron horse are not the same as formerly. The omnibus service,\r\nespecially, which, scarcely ten years ago, was considered the mildest,\r\nhas, at present, become the hardest, and the one which requires heavy\r\nhorses, uniting speed with strength.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as a consequence of the great changes in the life\r\nand means of conveyance of the wealthy, the Percheron race has been\r\nmost prominently brought forward. Almost all ranks of the upper\r\nclasses have now adopted the Percheron horse of the light kind for\r\ntheir private uses, hunts and drives in the country. The fondness for\r\nrapid traveling rendering these classes more exacting than formerly,\r\nthe necessity has arisen of finding in Perche, specimens with weight\r\nand speed with a light and stylish form. Accordingly, it becomes\r\nnecessary to find means of adding the greatest possible speed to the\r\nother valuable characteristics of the Percheron horse. To reach this\r\nresult promptly, we should have recourse to the Arabian stallion, and\r\nthis, surely, would be the quickest means. But as I do not find this\r\nPercheron race, in its present state, sufficiently prepared for this\r\nalliance, and as I think that it still needs two or three generations\r\nof preparatory crossings with itself, it will be necessary to commence,\r\nin order to attain this end, by close interbreeding.\r\n\r\nWe should, at first, commence by exploring the Percheron centers\r\ndevoted exclusively to the rearing of mares, and, in these places, we\r\nshould particularly visit the localities in which they have no great\r\ndevelopment as to height. Here we would select a group of from fifteen\r\nto twenty fillies, the best, the finest limbed, the most compact, the\r\nfastest trotters, and having for an extreme maximum the height of 15½\r\nto 16 hands.\r\n\r\nThe same course should be pursued in the regions where the colts are\r\nraised, and there choice should be made of some light stallions,\r\napproaching, as much as possible, to the mares in form and qualities.\r\n\r\nAll the best foals, then, should be in their turn subjected to\r\ncouplings conducted with the same care, and among the third generation\r\nwould be found types sufficiently confirmed, either as founders of a\r\nrace among themselves, or for crossing with the Arab, of which we will\r\nspeak in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nIf a little larger size be required, it would not be necessary to\r\nhave recourse to other types than those which I have just indicated.\r\nWell-balanced horses favor every modification. More tonic, substantial\r\nnourishment, and more fertile meadows would increase the height and\r\nweight, as well as the strength and spirit.\r\n\r\nDo you desire omnibus horses?—You can obtain them by selecting in\r\nthe regions which best produce the post-horse, the strongest types,\r\nthe heaviest bodied, the most favored as to height, and the fastest\r\ntrotters. But never yield any of these three points: weight, spirit,\r\nand speed.\r\n\r\nThe animals the nearest alike in size and form should then be coupled\r\ntogether, after the manner indicated above, and when weight, spirit,\r\nand speed, are found without failing in all the progeny, it will then\r\nbe time, but not till then, to add style. The Arabian stallion, whose\r\ntendency, as we will see later, is to produce heavier and stronger\r\nthan himself, while at the same time imparting his mark of supreme\r\ndistinction, might then be introduced to embellish and confirm our good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe heavy draft and the express wagon horses should have weight:\r\nthis is a _sine qua non_ condition; but it would be a great mistake\r\nto confine ourselves exclusively to mere size. They should possess\r\npowerful limbs and muscles, joined to great spirit. This crossing,\r\nalthough the easiest, would also present great dangers should we be\r\nsatisfied with weight alone; we would soon arrive at the mere lymphatic\r\nhorse. It is, therefore, urgent, for the breeds possessing requisite\r\nstrength, to choose those which are the most _distingué_, the most\r\nnervous, the finest limbed, and the most spirited, and to avoid the\r\nsluggish and lymphatic. These will be found in the elevated and dry\r\ncenters, where the food is plenty and nutritious.\r\n\r\nIf Perche proper, Beauce, and the environs of Chateaudun, should not be\r\ncapable of furnishing their complete contingent in this specialty (as I\r\nbelieve they cannot,) some good specimens could be met with among the\r\nPercheron colts raised in the environs of Bernay and on the plains of\r\nSens.\r\n\r\nThis variety (the draft-horse) demands a great deal less care in\r\nthe choice of the dams and sires. It is infinitely more elementary,\r\nsince weight is principally sought after. Still, it is well, even\r\nindispensable, to select individuals short coupled and with good\r\nquarters, to hold out under the enormous loads they are obliged to\r\ndraw. The means resorted to to accomplish this are judicious crosses,\r\nconstantly made with a well-determined and always identical idea,\r\ntending to increase weight and strength, while preserving spirit and\r\nvigor, abundant nourishment, and breeding in those sections naturally\r\nmost propitious to style and size. Soon, Perche, placed in a situation\r\nwithout a rival for the present, and, above all, for the future, might\r\nforever avoid asking any thing of foreign crossings. For though the\r\nchoice of the stallion and the mare is so important in the _production_\r\nof the foal, the climate, the kind of food, the agricultural habits,\r\nand, finally, the adaptation of the region to horse breeding, are of\r\na great deal more importance in the _development_ of the animal. It\r\nbecomes, then, somewhat difficult to indicate accurately to what types,\r\nin such particular cases, the preference should be awarded. The best\r\nare those which most nearly meet the wants of the section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE BREED BY MEANS OF FOREIGN CROSSINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if with strength acquired and faults corrected, style is not\r\nattained, it may be sought after by judicious crosses with well-chosen\r\nforeign types.\r\n\r\nTwo different breeds present themselves to us as means of improving\r\nour stock by the introduction of foreign blood: the Arabian, and the\r\nEnglish, with its variations. Starting from this point, let us study\r\nboth and endeavor to discover, by analogy, which one would best suit,\r\nor, rather, which one is the least unfavorable to the purpose.\r\n\r\nI will examine, one after another, these two methods in detail, leaving\r\nto the cultivator, who is most interested in the question, the choice\r\nof employing that which seems to him the best and the most appropriate,\r\ntaking into view the fertility and the nature of his section. But\r\nI must, from the beginning, lay down as a principle that both are\r\nmore expensive than is interbreeding. A race to become fit to receive\r\na foreign cross, should be prepared for it in advance, in order to\r\nshorten, as much as possible, the distance existing between the breed\r\nso formed and proved and that which we seek to create.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the foreign cross can do no good, unless the desired\r\nqualities in the race upon which it is made are permanent, fixed, and\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nWhy not think also of increasing our resources by better cultivation,\r\nby liberal feeding, by choosing, as I have said above, among the race\r\nof the country, the most perfect types and those most likely to correct\r\nwhat is vicious while they impart their own good qualities? Methods of\r\nthis kind, pursued for a long time and persistently, are alone capable\r\nof preparing, without inconvenience, for a foreign cross.\r\n\r\nDrain your wet meadows, irrigate your hill-sides, fertilize your soil\r\nby the use of improving manures, make productive fields everywhere,\r\ncreate meadows, grow heavy oats, enlarge your stables and make them\r\nclean, healthy and airy. When you have done this, then, but not before,\r\nyou can cross your races with foreign blood, more delicate than yours\r\nand accustomed to and requiring greater care and attention.\r\n\r\nI know that this slowly progressive manner does not possess the\r\nsympathies of those who, at the commencement, are restless at not\r\nhaving already reached the goal. But it is sure and free from errors,\r\nwhilst the other, (France has but too many examples of this), after\r\nmoney squandered and years wasted, reduces the breeder who has recourse\r\nto it to a more miserable condition than that from which he wished to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nOur _furia francese_, which renders us, irresistible in war, our\r\nfancy for new fashions, which gives birth to those wonders which the\r\nworld hails with ecstacy, and our proverbial inconstancy, cause us\r\nalmost always to go astray in breeding. Fashion has no sooner praised\r\nhorses of such and such a race, of this or that model, or such and\r\nsuch a coat, than we must immediately produce the like, without first\r\nascertaining whether or no our race be prepared for crossing with them.\r\nThe result of such crosses would be about as valuable as a discussion\r\nbetween a fishwoman and an academician!\r\n\r\nNature, left to herself, is a thousand times more intelligent than the\r\nman of systems. Are there ever found, among the wild animals, among\r\nlions, tigers, stags, chamois, etc., either spavins, tumors, periodical\r\ninflammations, or any of those thousand infirmities with which our\r\ndomestic horse is afflicted?—And here is the reason: in the rutting\r\nseason, the possession of the females becomes the incitement to bloody\r\nbattles. It is always the strongest, the most vigorous, the bravest,\r\nthe most venturesome, and the best made stallion, which receives as a\r\nreward for his victory, the submission and the admiring love of the\r\nharem.\r\n\r\nBut I assume Perche prepared, by numerous and good crossings of the\r\nrace within itself, to try, with more sureness, foreign crossings. Two\r\nprincipal types, as we have just seen, are presented for this: the Arab\r\ntype and the English, which is itself derived from the Arab.\r\n\r\nThe foreign cross I only speak of with diffidence, because with it I\r\nenter unknown regions of inductions and perhaps, alas! into ways of\r\ndeception and ruin, if it is not effected with the greatest prudence\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\nForeign crossings, systematically effected from the north to the south,\r\nand from the south to the north, have had Buffon for their apostle,\r\nand, under the cloak of his genius, and thanks to the authority of\r\nhis word, they have reached everywhere. But how enumerate the evils\r\nbrought about by a school, whose disciples are still numerous, thanks\r\nto a perseverance irritated but not deterred by failure? These evils\r\nhave been branded in large characters on all our breeds, since that day\r\nwhen they became the objects, not of constant and uniform care, but\r\nconsidered as subjects of no consequence, upon which individuals might\r\nexperiment in order to test their theories, and set themselves up as\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nSince then, we have no more types properly belonging to distinct\r\ndistricts, but a confused assembly, combining with rare qualities the\r\ndefects of this or that cross and twenty others more. Everywhere in\r\nturn, from one region or another, were stallions employed of different\r\ntypes and races: those of the south transported to the north, and\r\nthose of the north to the south; and that without preparation, and\r\nwithout attention to the differences of soil and climate of the\r\nvarious regions. All these practices have injured our breeds without\r\nsuccessfully retaining their own native qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARAB CROSSING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI commence with the Arab crossing. Two motives have induced me to\r\nfollow this classification:\r\n\r\n_1st._ The Arabian is the type horse, and the type should be examined\r\nbefore its derivatives.\r\n\r\n_2nd._ The Percheron shows a very great analogy, by his coat,\r\nconformation, character of race, mild disposition, and endurance, to\r\nthe Arab, of which he seems to be the son, notwithstanding certain\r\ndifferences, the result of time, climate, and the region in which he is\r\nbred and in which he lives.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Percheron horse exhibits in common with the Arab\r\nnumerous marks of a common parentage and relationship: these marks are\r\nvery obvious. A Percheron, a true Percheron, for some still exist, (as\r\nthe famous _Toulouse_ of M. Chéradame, of Ecouché; and the renowned\r\n_Jean-le-Blanc_ of M. Miard, of Villers, near Sap, in the department\r\nof the Orne, etc., etc.,) placed alongside of an Arab, presents,\r\nnotwithstanding his heavier and grosser form, analogies with him so\r\nstriking that we are easily induced to believe them undoubted relations.\r\n\r\nThe Percheron of the primitive type has a gray coat like the Arab;\r\nand like him an abundant and silky mane, a fine skin, and a large,\r\nprominent, and expressive eye; a broad forehead, dilated nostrils, and\r\na full and deep chest, although, the girth, with him, as with the Arab,\r\nis always lacking in fullness; more bony and leaner limbs, and less\r\ncovered with hair than those of other draft-horse families.\r\n\r\nHe has not, it is true, the fine haunch and fine form of the shoulder,\r\nnor that swan-like neck which distinguishes the Arab; but it must not\r\nbe forgotten that for ages he has been employed for draft purposes, and\r\nthese habits have imparted to his bony frame an anatomical structure, a\r\ncombination of levers adapted to the work he is called upon to perform.\r\nHe has not, I again acknowledge, such a fine skin as the Arab, nor his\r\nprettily rounded, oval, and small foot; but we must remember the fact\r\nthat he lives under a cold climate, upon elevated plains, where nature\r\ngives him for a covering a thicker skin and a warmer coat, and that he\r\nhas been for ages stepping upon a moist, clayey soil.\r\n\r\nIn all that remains in him, we recognize a heavy Arab, modified and\r\nremodeled by climate and peculiar circumstances. He has remained mild\r\nand laborious, like his sire; he is brought up, like him, in the midst\r\nof the family, and, like him, he possesses in a very high degree the\r\nfaculty of easy acclimation. He acquires this in the midst of the\r\nnumerous migrations he accomplishes in Perche, the counterpart of\r\nthose that the type horse makes upon the sands of the desert. A final\r\ncomparison, which has not, as yet, been sufficiently noticed, is,\r\nthat, like the Arab, he has no need of being mutilated in order to be\r\ntrained, managed and kept without danger. In a word, the Percheron,\r\nnotwithstanding the ages which separate them, presents an affinity as\r\nclose as possible with the primitive horse, which is the Arab.\r\n\r\nFrom this similarity of form and probable relationship, comes the\r\nthought of new alliances. But in order to form a more easy estimate of\r\ntheir effects, it will not be without interest to classify the horses\r\nwith reference to their origin. This classification produces three\r\nvery distinct groups: the primitive horse, the natural horse, and the\r\ncompound horse.\r\n\r\nThe _Primitive Horse_, oriental in its origin, is the pure Arabian\r\nhorse; no other is acknowledged.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the crusaders, as we have already said in our first\r\npart, in consequence of wars and all kinds of excursions, individuals\r\nof this race were spread over almost all parts of the globe. Although\r\nat first the prestige which their superior merits deserved led to\r\ntheir being bred in-and-in, these exiles were placed under different\r\nlatitudes, in different atmospheric and hygienic conditions, which\r\ngradually modified their qualities and led to the degeneracy of the\r\nrace. And it became more or less degenerate in proportion as the\r\nsoil upon which the colts were foaled was colder, poorer, and more\r\ninhospitable; _for the horse is as much, and more, the son of the soil\r\nupon which he is foaled and reared as he is of his sire and dam_.\r\n\r\nThis fact has no need of proof. We see it every day before our eyes in\r\nstudying at home the changes that our French breeds themselves undergo\r\nwhen transported from one province to another. It might, however, be\r\nthought that these new latitudes, these new regions, would differ but\r\nlittle from those in which they lived.\r\n\r\nThe first change that the primitive horse undergoes, from the\r\ndifference of the regions into which he has been transplanted, being\r\ndue to nature itself, we call the result the _Natural Horse_.—Here\r\nit is proper to remark how wise nature always is. If it modify the\r\nprimitive horse for the worse, it modifies him, however, under\r\nconditions better adapted to his wants. In rendering him more puny,\r\nit renders him more temperate, and enables him to live and to nourish\r\nhimself upon the food that the locality is able to furnish. Submitted\r\nto the trials and the fatigues of war, and to all the miseries in its\r\ntrain, the natural horse, badly built, ungainly and puny as he is,\r\nendures fatigue almost as well as the primitive horse.\r\n\r\nThe _Cross-bred Horse_ is, as his name indicates, the issue of a\r\nsire and dam of different breeds. This crossing, made with a view to\r\nimprovement, may give, when judicious, more elegant, better made, and\r\nfiner-bodied progeny and also quicker in their various gaits, but\r\nalways requiring, especially if derived from the English, exceptional\r\ncare, and so much the more particular as they are of a more _distingué_\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAbandoned to himself, deprived of blankets, shelter, grooming, and\r\noats, the cross-bred deteriorates early, and in war perishes miserably,\r\nwhile the natural and the primitive horse thrives in browsing upon the\r\nscantiest herbage. On this score, our two campaigns of the Crimea and\r\nItaly have furnished unquestionable proofs.\r\n\r\nSuch is the result chiefly obtained with the too _distingué_ English\r\nhorse, even when delivered to the best working mares. In the army,\r\nespecially, is this point settled; they have there recognized and\r\nproved that the worst subjects were always the issue of authors having\r\ntoo much blood and too impressionable. No horses are more apt than\r\nthese to provoke and render ill humored, and, if I may so speak, ruin\r\nthe temper of the men placed over them.\r\n\r\nWhen a working race is crossed with the English, it is indispensable\r\nthat the stallion should be well bred and be but a quarter blood,—a\r\nquarter at the utmost. And the manner of balancing the blood is neither\r\nan indifferent thing nor a thing to be neglected. We should be very\r\ncareful not to accept as such the product of a full-blooded or even\r\nhalf-blooded stallion and a common mare, but should rather take the\r\nproduct, ameliorated through generations, of strong races that have\r\nbeen gradually perfected, such as, for instance, certain Norfolk\r\nhorses, certain roadsters and trotters, of which old _Juggard_ was\r\na type, and of which _Performer_, although not so marked, vaguely\r\nrecalled the memory.\r\n\r\nSince I have mentioned the name of Norfolk, let me say, that after\r\nthe Arab race, of all the foreign ones, the Norfolk trotter is the\r\none which seems to me to offer the greatest advantages in an alliance\r\nwith the Percheron. With both, good qualities and defects are diverse,\r\nso that they can complete and correct each other by means of a wisely\r\ncombined and carefully studied connection.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk horse has, it is true, an ugly head, and his eye is small\r\nand destitute of expression; but his neck, with good lines, starts\r\nwell from his breast; his shoulder is fine and well-sloped; his chest\r\nmagnificent, and his girth enormous; his loins broad, well-sustained\r\nand well-attached; his haunches long, his croup horizontal; his\r\nbuttocks well filled out and low; and his limbs strong, but not quite\r\nfree enough from fat; nor is his action always sufficiently stylish,\r\nyet he has a quick and free gait.\r\n\r\nGive to this horse a mare having a fine and expressive head, lighted\r\nup with a large, intelligent, well-opened eye; let her possess lean,\r\nelegant, and perfect limbs, and, a hundred to one, you will get a\r\nvaluable colt. But, with the Norfolk, as with all others, there are\r\ndegrees, and if I cross the Channel in search of a stock horse, I\r\nshould wish him to possess the following qualities:\r\n\r\nThis stallion should be rather large, have thick and strong limbs,\r\nchest fully developed, the girth as great as possible, very heavy in\r\nthe hind-quarters, buttocks descending well, forehead broad and open,\r\nand the eye large and expressive. He should be always shorter in height\r\nthan the mares, but quite as broad, and, I repeat it, as short-limbed\r\nas possible, on account of an invariable, innate tendency of the\r\nEnglish horse to height and thinness. He should be neither cross, nor,\r\nabove all, affected with that nervous sensitiveness too common in the\r\nEnglish breeds. His action should be quick, well kept up, bold and\r\nsquare. He should have, if possible, a decided and well-pronounced\r\ncolor, either a dark bay or a chestnut. Breeding stock of his get\r\nshould be chosen under identical conditions, and then they would be on\r\na footing with him, although, logically speaking, there would be always\r\nan inclination to prefer the type to the sub-type.\r\n\r\nBut, at present, it is easy to be deceived, even in England, in regard\r\nto the stock of the country. There is less risk in using, if he can be\r\nfound, a good, heavy Anglo-Norman horse, bred and reared under our eyes\r\nin Merlerault or on the plains of Alençon, than a spurious English one,\r\nwhich is often none other than a forlorn hope of some nameless region.\r\nIn fact, from certain appearances, there is reason to fear that persons\r\nfrom the other side of the Channel visit the continent to do a smart\r\nthing, and purchase heavy, lymphatic colts to bring up on some English\r\nfarm, and then resell them as Norfolk horses. What kind of improvement\r\nis to be expected from such means? We should always respect the will\r\nof nature, which allows us to assist her in her course, but we should\r\nnever violate her laws.\r\n\r\nMan vainly wishes to force nature with all these crosses, at which\r\nshe takes exceptions. To all this so-called science she opposes her\r\nrelentless logic; these products are an unnatural brood, which she\r\nrefuses to acknowledge as her own. She stops short, and, no matter how\r\ngood these results may appear in themselves, the error crops out, and\r\nit is known by experience that they almost all fail when put to the\r\ntest of breeding.\r\n\r\nBut suppose every measure of prudence taken, even suppose there has\r\nbeen no mistake, most of the produce resulting from this first crossing\r\nwill be, generally, lighter built than their dams. However, among the\r\nnumber there will be found some which, uniting weight to beauty, will\r\nconstitute good types with athletic and regular forms. The latter only\r\nshould be preserved, and these only can be usefully employed, either\r\namong themselves or outside of their own families, in the improvement\r\nof our stock.\r\n\r\nAt the second crossing, the imperfections observed at the first will\r\ndisappear in a great measure, and from the third crossing, with\r\nconstant care, unflinching attention, and unwearied patience, the\r\ndifficult problem will be solved: size combined with vigor, hardiness\r\nof constitution with style, and weight with elegance.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, by wishing to make too quick progress, there\r\nshould be too much difference between the stallion and the mare, the\r\nresulting stock, although in appearance successful, will always prove\r\nbad breeders, giving ungainly results, with blemishes which would never\r\nhave occurred in proceeding wisely, especially not in improving by\r\nmeans _of the primitive horse_, all of whose ancestors are of the same\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThis latter crossing, that is, with the Arab, may sometimes give\r\nslower, but with it we are always sure to obtain finally better\r\nresults. Thus in making choice of the best Percheron mares and crossing\r\nthem with fine, but the stoutest possible, Arabs, we would advance\r\ntowards certain improvements, and at the end of a few generations, we\r\nwould be sure to find at each foaling season fine types, combining\r\nwith the strength and docility of the dams the style, spirit, and\r\nintelligence, of the sires. For, it must not be forgotten, work\r\nrequires intelligent horses; the more they are gifted with this\r\nquality, the longer they last and the more useful their services.\r\n\r\nIf the drunken driver of the Lyons Railroad, whose adventure is known\r\nthe world over, had not had for his working companion a brute as nobly\r\nintelligent as the old horse _Lapin_, employed in hauling dirt carts,\r\nhe would surely have perished. The driver having fallen in a state of\r\nintoxication on the railroad, before a train descending a grade, was\r\non the point of being run over, when the horse, seeing him in this\r\nperilous situation and at the risk of being himself crushed, seized\r\nhim by the waist and lifted him off the track. This deed, performed\r\nunder the eyes of several squads of workmen, was soon known over the\r\nwhole line, and won for _Lapin_ the title of _The (invalid’s and\r\nworkingmen’s) Adopted Son_, a nobly gained title and well-merited\r\nreward, if ever there was one.\r\n\r\nIn the legends of all times are to be found examples of the\r\nintelligence of the oriental horse; but I have never heard quoted\r\na single one in regard to the English thoroughbred, which seems\r\nonly formed for pride, gluttony, and brutality. As an example of\r\nthe sagacity of the Arab, I will limit myself to mentioning a fact\r\nwitnessed by all the officers of the school of Saumur. At this school\r\nthere was an old Arabian known to the whole army. One day, a lady\r\nhaving her handkerchief scented with, I know not what perfume, passed\r\nin front of the veteran, caressing and feeding him with dainties. From\r\nthat time on, the officer who accompanied the lady could never enter\r\nher parlor, although the odor of the perfume was imperceptible to all,\r\nbut the horse, on his return, was aware of the fact, and bore witness\r\nto it, each time, by neighing and by a hundred expressions of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe vigor and pluck of the oriental horse have passed into a proverb.\r\nThere is not a soldier in our army who cannot bear testimony to this.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the English cavalry almost all perished in the Crimean\r\nwar, whilst our Algerian horses almost all returned. In the Italian war\r\nour Algerian horses bore well the fatigues of the campaign, where the\r\nhorses springing from the English were decimated.\r\n\r\nIt appears impossible that these two proofs should have no\r\nsignification and should not teach a lesson. Ought it not to be\r\nconcluded from them that the war-horse, that is the horse for\r\nendurance, should only be of Arab blood or at least derived from the\r\nArab?\r\n\r\nAnd are we not justified in believing that what has taken place with\r\nthe war-horse applies also to other horses destined for continuous\r\nwork? Hence are we not right in always preferring the Arab to the\r\nEnglish stallion, when it is a question of improving the different\r\nbreeds of work and draft-horses, as well as the war horse?\r\n\r\nThe Arabian stallion would seem so much the more fit for this use, as a\r\nlong experience has proved that his get upon our native mares are much\r\nheavier than himself; they, at the same time, always transmitting a\r\nrich, unblemished blood and a solid frame—qualities which are preserved\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe Arab horse imparts, also, great endurance to his progeny, and\r\nwithout going back as far as the turf, where we see figuring on the top\r\nround of the ladder _Arlequin_, _Zephyr_, _Valencia_, _Corysandre_ the\r\nLorraine, whose dam was an Arabian of _Deux-Ponts_, _Anthony_, _Eylau_,\r\n_Kasbas_, and _Palmyre_, let us be satisfied with citing in mass, all\r\nthe fine and spirited breeds of Limousin, Navarre, Bigorre, Tarbes, and\r\nAuvergne, showing in every pore the presence of the Oriental blood.\r\n\r\nIt is also especially to be remarked, although the Arab does not trot\r\nand only gallops, that all his get are quick, square trotters. We can\r\nproduce numberless examples of this, although Arab blood has been\r\ninfinitely less disseminated than any other in our Northern districts.\r\n\r\nWe can cite the famous _Eclipse_ of M. de Narbonne, the no less famous\r\n_Herminie_ of M. Forcinal, all the descendants of _Bacha_, _Aslan_ and\r\n_Gallipoli_, which were matchless, and the noble sons of _Massoud_,\r\n_Eylau_, and _Noteur_. But, as all these have a certain amount of\r\nEnglish blood joined to the Arab, we shall be answered:—It was the\r\nEnglish blood that trotted and gave them their winning points.—We will\r\nconfine ourselves to citing only the sons of _Bédouin_, all admirable\r\ntrotters, though all coming of poor Brittany mares, the _Kerims_, the\r\n_Avisos_, and the _Moggys_, whose fine action invariably attracts the\r\nattention of every one.\r\n\r\nBut the endurance possessed by the Arab in so eminent a degree is not\r\nthe only quality to be considered. It is also the opinion of the best\r\nbreeders that the race is good tempered, docile, patient, of great\r\nprecocity, and easily raised, all of which qualities it invariably\r\ntransmits to its get.\r\n\r\nNo steeple-chase horses have shown themselves more intelligent\r\nthan _Pledge_, _Raphael_, _Senora_, and above all the immortal\r\n_Franc-Picard_, by whom the best riders found themselves excelled in\r\nthe art of measuring an obstacle and mastering it skillfully; also,\r\nthose were deep in the Arab blood. If _Auricula_, notwithstanding he\r\nwas a son of _Baron_, with his variable and peevish temper has shown\r\nhimself to be, when he chose, one of the best leapers of our age, it is\r\nbecause through his dam he is of Arab blood.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations the Arabian seems greatly preferable to\r\nthe English horse, which exacts, moreover, too much tact and skill\r\non the part of man. The education of the wagon driver is not yet\r\nsufficiently advanced for him to be able to reap all the advantages\r\nclaimed of the working races. The irritability of the English horse,\r\nhis impatience, and his nervousness, which are, doubtless, of utility\r\non the turf, are transmitted to all his descendants, which for this\r\nvery reason are less fit for work, less governable, and more trying to\r\nthe patience of the raw and ignorant driver during protracted service.\r\n\r\nAll who have raised colts out of common mares by Arabians are unanimous\r\nin opinion, and we have ourselves proved it, that their get is\r\ngenerally even tempered, of a mild, willing, and quiet disposition,\r\neasily and cheaply reared, and fit for work at three years old, thus\r\npaying for their keep.\r\n\r\nIt is quite the contrary with the colt of English blood. He, by reason\r\nof his fractiousness, his nervous ardor, his exacting nature, and his\r\nslow growth, requires a degree of care and management which does not\r\npermit him to render any essential service before the age of five years.\r\n\r\nIt results from this that the Arabian progeny, even at the first\r\ncrossing, which is always the most difficult and critical, pays for\r\nits nourishment from the age of three years, whilst the English does\r\nnot pay until he has reached five years, and this without counting\r\nthe greater expense of his raising and the difficulty of finding men\r\ncapable of breaking and training him without accident and bringing him\r\nsafe to that quinquennial period.\r\n\r\nWere their qualities the same, the Arabian would cost much less to the\r\nbreeder than the English horse. To the former, then, should always be\r\ngiven the preference in moderately rich countries where agriculture has\r\nnot arrived at great perfection. Thus it was by means of the Arabian\r\nthat Limousin, Navarre, Bigorre, the plains of Tarbes and Auvergne,\r\nall countries neither very fertile nor wealthy, have formed their\r\nunrivalled horses, the hardiness of which suited the productions of\r\nthe soil. These being unsuited to the more delicate and less vigorous\r\nEnglish horse, its introduction was an injury to the native stock.\r\nIn our days, Limousin has been ruined by the introduction of English\r\nblood, as formerly, in the district of Tarbes, three important\r\nbreeders, Messrs. de Gontaut, de Bouillac, and de Montréal, ruined\r\ntheir studs with the English cross.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian can be used without fear upon the undulating slopes of\r\nelevated hills, and upon thin stony lands where agriculture is but\r\nlittle advanced; but the English horse requires rich, well-cultivated\r\nmeadows and grassy valleys.\r\n\r\nAs regards form, the Arab cross is the surest. The sire being, if I may\r\nso speak, _sui generis_, of a confirmed race, and possessing for ages\r\na like shape, his get always resemble him, no matter what may be the\r\nrace, color, shape, and derivation, of the dam. Only, in consequence of\r\nthe warmth and strength of his blood, the progeny is always larger and\r\nheavier than the sire.\r\n\r\nIt is not so with the English horse. Made up, and not having the\r\nsame confirmed nature as the Arab, he has not the same sureness in\r\ngenerating. Sometimes his get is large and sometimes small. His progeny\r\nmay be spare or may be stout. This comes from his ancestors being at\r\ntimes of one height and at times of another, and often resembling\r\ndifferent types.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt, perhaps, at too great length upon our preference for\r\nthe Arab cross; it now remains to put it in practice. The method to be\r\npursued in making this cross is simple.\r\n\r\nHaving an Arabian of pure race, the heaviest and finest bodied that can\r\nbe found, put him to the heaviest and strongest short-limbed mares.\r\nSell the male produce of this cross, unless it has been a perfect\r\nsuccess. Be less strict with the fillies, reject a smaller number, and\r\nuse the good for breeding. As much as their conformation will permit,\r\nand in order to fix the Arab blood in a deeper and more indelible\r\nmanner, some choice specimens may be put either to their sire himself,\r\nor to such of the half-brothers as should have proved themselves the\r\nbest. But beyond the first trial, consanguineous crossings should\r\nnever again be contracted, except under exceedingly rare circumstances,\r\nor under great temptation. The dam of one of the most justly celebrated\r\nhorses of our times is the result of breeding a stallion to his dam.\r\nFrom and after the second generation, colts and fillies, provided their\r\nmerit had rendered them worthy of being used as producers, might be\r\ntaken as types, and as a starting point of a solid and sure improvement\r\nof the race of a country.\r\n\r\nWhen, in consequence of age and numerous generations of his own get\r\ngrowing up around him, the common sire might be exposed to alliances\r\nwith his grandchildren, it would become indispensable to transfer him\r\nto a distant district by proceeding in the manner indicated above.\r\n\r\nAfter such an infusion of warm blood many years might elapse without\r\nthe necessity of recurring again to Arabian stock. But if it should be\r\nremarked that its distinctive characteristics commenced to disappear\r\nfrom the breed, and the action became less free and light, it should be\r\nagain resorted to immediately, following the same method as before.\r\n\r\nThe light draft types at first obtained, might, according to the\r\ndistricts in which they are raised, be transformed into the posting,\r\nomnibus, and even heavy draft types. But all should be done with time\r\nand without haste nor even _wishing_ to depart from a wise and prudent\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\nI cannot terminate this chapter without warning the breeder against\r\na peculiarity which hardly ever fails to strike a person, who, for\r\nthe first time, makes a trial of the Arab cross, and which has even\r\ninduced some to abandon this method without reaping its fruits. I\r\ndesire to speak of a certain disproportion, more apparent than real, of\r\nthe limbs with the body. It is thus explained: The Arabian, born and\r\nraised in a poor and barren country, is no sooner transported to a more\r\nfertile region, than a certain fullness of the body is an immediate\r\nconsequence of this change. His progeny, easily fattened, rapidly\r\nbecome corpulent. It results from this, that although strongly limbed,\r\nthey appear, for a large body, to have but weak extremities. But have\r\npatience; oats will draw in and strengthen those inflated flanks, and,\r\nafter the second generation, the stomach of the colt will enlarge on\r\naccount of the food being more abundant than concentrated, the fat will\r\ndisappear, and his compact and solid limbs will appear what they really\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish blood, infused with judgment, allies well with the Percheron\r\nrace, and we have met with perfectly successful results in the midst\r\nof the disappointments which have been the consequences of injudicious\r\ncrossing. Too often these crossings have been effected in violation of\r\ncommon sense, without any attention to the distance which separates\r\nthe blood horse from the common, low-bred Percheron mare, she having\r\nno affinity with him. But these trials require science, wealth, and\r\nperseverance, and are far from being within the reach of ordinary\r\nbreeders. Those who would succeed must possess the talent of waiting,\r\nfor unfortunately the rearing of the resulting progeny is a burden.\r\nTheir slow development renders them but little fit for the labors to\r\nwhich the farmer is in the habit of consigning his colts. Then, they\r\ncannot, like the young Percheron, pass from hand to hand, and thus\r\nthey find themselves stripped of the only advantage which renders the\r\nraising of the draft colts so profitable: avoiding embarrassment and\r\naffording a prompt profit to all through whose hands they pass. In\r\nfact, it can easily be conceived how favorably, at present, are these\r\nchances of profit distributed among several hands. The capital invested\r\nis soon returned; and thus this operation is within the reach of all\r\npurses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE IMPERIAL.—FRENCH NORMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe issue of English blood, if judiciously managed, will some day be\r\nfiner than the unimproved Percheron. But, although carefully looked\r\nafter and abundantly fed, he will remain puny during his early growth,\r\nand therefore his account can only be closed at a distant date. By\r\nwhom, then, is he to be raised? By the farmer rich in ready money? In\r\nevery country such men are rare. By the large landed proprietor? But he\r\nis not a breeder, or if he be, it is only of race-horses.\r\n\r\nSome half-blood English stallions noted for strength and weight,\r\nstanding at Mesle-sur-Sarthe, Courtomer, and Nogent-le-Rotrou, have\r\nproduced fine coach and draft-horses, but their number has always been\r\nrather limited, and they have nearly all been raised without care,\r\nlike the half-blood colt simply at pasture; consequently, the profit\r\naccruing has been nothing, or nearly nothing, and these have been able\r\nto add nothing useful in the way of example and imitation.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in Lower Perche, commencing at Nogent and extending\r\nas far as Vendôme, the draft-horse, properly speaking, is the only one\r\nthat has been raised. The wagon-horse is there only met with as an\r\nexception, and the cultivator is far from being the worse off on this\r\naccount. Witness the prosperity of Montdoubleau, which has become the\r\nfirst market of Europe; witness the splendid and spirited trotting\r\nmares it produces every year, and of which the _Julies_ of M. Derré and\r\nthe _Sarahs_ of M. Lamoureux are glorious specimens.\r\n\r\nPerche has seen but twice, to our knowledge, good and irrefutable\r\nresults obtained from the English crossing with her race—the first,\r\nwith _Sandy_; the second, with _Bayard_. _Sandy_ was a draft stallion,\r\nwith a long and silky mane, a perfectly white coat, and with a high and\r\ngraceful gait like that of an oriental horse; lean and strong legs, a\r\nshort head, dilated nostrils, and a large and intelligent eye. Although\r\nfoaled in England, this horse was evidently not English; he must have\r\ncome of eastern blood, as this is so often seen among our neighbors who\r\nsuccessfully use the Arab blood in the formation of their draft and\r\nhunting races.\r\n\r\nAs for _Bayard_, he was a son of a Percheron mare belonging to M. Viel,\r\nof Chiffreville, near Argenton, one of the finest and purest ever seen.\r\nThis mare had been bred to _Idalis_, a small and well-knit wagon-horse,\r\nson of _Don Quichotte_, who descended from the thoroughbred brood-mare\r\n_Moina_. Consequently, _Bayard_ had in his veins some of the best\r\noriental blood, and it is to this circumstance that is attributed the\r\nvigor, gait, and beauty, of all his progeny.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the two stallions _Benvenuto_ and _Fandango_, which passed for\r\nAnglo-Percherons, and which have been cited as types of draft-horse\r\nstallions, will be held up to me as a refutation. _Benvenuto_, the\r\nstallion from Pin, which has produced well in Perche, was not the son\r\nof _Eastham_ and a Percheron mare, as was said at the time in order to\r\nhave him accepted by the government, but was really out of a Percheron\r\nmare by a Percheron stallion coming from the neighborhood of Bellesme,\r\nand the descendant of Arabian stallions which had been standing in that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n_Fandango_, the other crossed Percheron, uniformly a successful\r\nstallion, had double cross, on the sire’s side, of the blood of the\r\nArabian _Dagout_, and his dam, whose pedigree has also been explained\r\nto me, came likewise from near _Bellesme_.\r\n\r\nA Percheron stallion called _Jean-le-Blanc_, native of Mauves, and\r\nsold about the year 1825 to a M. Viard of Villers, in Ouche, near\r\nSap, (department of the Orne,) has been the sole improving agent of\r\nthe equine race in Ouche, which, up to that time, was reduced to\r\nmiserable small horses without any stamp or value. Although heavy,\r\npowerful, and, indeed, a shaft-horse, his gait and an indescribable\r\nsomething pervading his whole body, recalled so thoroughly the idea of\r\nthe oriental family that one was disposed to take him for an enlarged\r\nArabian. This fact, often related to us, excited our curiosity. We did\r\nnot rest until pressing inquiry upon inquiry, one after another, we\r\nascertained that his family had been crossed with a stallion from the\r\nPin stables, standing at the Chateau of Côèsmes, near Bellesme. And,\r\nwhat was this stallion? The Arab _Gallipoli_!\r\n\r\nWhat can be inferred from these facts, if it be not that the crossings\r\nwhich have best succeeded in Perche have been those of the Arab, and\r\nthat the English crosses have only succeeded when tempered by contact\r\nwith the Arab?\r\n\r\nBut if the absolute want of stallions for improving the breed be felt\r\namong the pure Percherons; if it be impossible to procure either good\r\nArabs or heavy English, freshly tempered with Arab blood; if important\r\nand powerful considerations compel a recourse to the English cross, the\r\nlatter should only be accepted intelligently and under good and wise\r\nconditions. Therefore we ask leave to refer the reader particularly to\r\nwhat we have already advanced in the preceding chapter upon the choice\r\nof an English stallion.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, in the department of Finisterre, we have often heard it\r\ndeclared by quite a large number of breeders, that for having wished\r\nto proceed too fast in that way, they had, from the commencement,\r\nexperienced numberless disappointments, the second generation from the\r\nEnglish cross being always inferior to the first. From stout sires\r\nand dams, who, from their general appearance might be classed in the\r\ncategory of heavy-draft, there daily came ungainly stock, thin,\r\nlanky, leggy, and without weight in the hind-quarter, unattractive,\r\nof a difficult sale when young, and proving a veritable misfortune to\r\nthe small farmer counting upon the sale of the colt to pay his rent\r\nand having neither the place nor means to raise him. This stock was,\r\nmoreover, the object of another disappointment quite as serious as the\r\nfirst; rarely was a good worker to be found among this burdensome race.\r\n\r\nIs not this tall, lank, weak,—in a word this abortive progeny,—issue of\r\nstrong and hardy parents, a strange and discouraging result? “Oh! why\r\nis this?” exclaimed the Brittany cultivators. There was a simple reason\r\nfor it, of which they had not learned the value. They proceeded with\r\nrace-horse speed in the way of crossing, and gave no oats. They were\r\nignorant of the requirements of the _distingué_ horse; they did not\r\nknow that in the sire and dam, or at least in one of them, there was\r\ncirculating more or less English blood, which produces strange results\r\nin proportion as it leaves its native place and reaches a poor country\r\nor one of hard work, and in which it no longer receives the prodigal\r\ncare of its native land.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Arab preserves indefinitely his warm blood and\r\nconstantly gives what he has not even himself,—although this truth\r\nresembles a paradox,—that is: a powerful appearance and a strong\r\nframe. It is not the same with the English horse and his derivatives;\r\nthey become thin and always degenerate. If their progeny be not fed\r\nwith oats without stint,—they require this, and are heavy eaters,\r\nlike everything which comes from the north,—their blood grows poorer\r\nrapidly. In successive generations of these families, born in a dull\r\nand damp atmosphere scarcely ever visited by the sun, the legs become\r\nlean and lanky. It is necessary to recur incessantly to new drafts of\r\nEnglish upon English, always expensive and requiring additional care,\r\nwithout taking into account that the result of too great an infusion\r\nof this peevish and often irascible blood would be to destroy the\r\nheavy-draft race—a race that I would like to see preserved intact\r\nalongside of the two others, though he be not quite suited to a country\r\nas hilly as Perche. He might, doubtless, plow successfully the vast and\r\nsmooth plains of Beauce; but this is not the lot of all. I look for\r\nhim in that busy country called Perche, where he must, without rest or\r\npity, with a shoulder free from all tenderness, drag heavy vehicles\r\nto the tops of hills, and it will please me to see the play of his\r\nhaunches and limbs in descending with these loads bravely and without\r\nflinching to the bottom of the valleys.\r\n\r\nDo you expect, also, from a horse derived from English blood that\r\ncool, restrained, and ever fresh energy, that courageous patience of\r\nwhich the Percheron, every day, gives an example in the omnibuses of\r\nthe streets of Paris? Dragging at a trot heavy loads, the weight of\r\nwhich frightens the imagination; stopping short, both in ascending\r\nor descending; starting off freely and always without balking; never\r\nsulking at his work or food, and fearing neither heat nor cold: this is\r\na specimen of Percheron qualities.\r\n\r\nDo you expect from an unjudicious cross with English blood a good,\r\nheavy draft-horse, a good shaft-horse, or a true wagon-horse? No one\r\nhas now any illusion on this score.\r\n\r\nIn London, a traction of only about 2,000 lbs. is required of a\r\ndraft-horse. In Paris, the horses harnessed to the heavy stone carts\r\nare required to drag as much as 5,000 lbs. each, and often even more.\r\n\r\nWhat will dealers in heavy draft-horses do? The trade is already taxed\r\nto supply the demand. For long experience has taught, and unjudicious\r\ncrosses have proved the English horse and his derivatives to be unfit\r\nfor this purpose, for they are too nervous and not sufficiently\r\nstaunch. Thus, the trade avoids them by instinct, and by instinct\r\navoids every thing resembling them. And, on the other hand, it seizes\r\nhold of and clings eagerly to every indication that can serve it as a\r\nsign or mark—every thing that can guide it in the search for what it\r\nlikes, and every thing that can guard against its opposite.\r\n\r\nHence, it repels and proscribes the dark-colored coats without\r\nexamination and reflection, because they are considered the colors of\r\nthe English horse; it accepts the grays with confidence, because with\r\nthem it perceives the absence of the dreaded blood, and in them it has\r\nfound that which satisfies all its wants. Would we have arrived at this\r\npoint if we had been prudent, and had the cross-breeding been better\r\nunderstood?\r\n\r\nFinally, what is there at the end of this negative pole and this\r\npositive pole? There is the Percheron on whom has devolved, and will\r\ndevolve for a long time yet, the rude and killing mission of executing\r\nthe feats of strength exacted of him by modern civilization. The\r\nprofits in supplying the demand, accrue, and will accrue for a long\r\ntime to the producer.\r\n\r\nThus so long as machinery does not replace the horse in the traction\r\nof heavy carriages, so long as the necessity for hard labor remains,\r\nrequiring strength, intelligence, endurance, and willingness, so long\r\nto the Percheron alone will be reserved the dangerous honor of being\r\nthe great draft power, and the price of this matchless agent will\r\nincrease in proportion to the growing impossibility of finding his\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nIt is now the time, while crossing the active and trotting breeds with\r\nthe Arab or with the well-chosen English horse, to carefully preserve\r\nthe heavy draft-horse, and, by means of persevering and judicious\r\ncrossing, retain for him his marked superiority.\r\n\r\nThese crossings, which I will sum up in concluding, may find a powerful\r\naid in the creation of a Stud-book of the Percheron breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT BY MEANS OF THE STUD-BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Percheron breed is old enough, is propagated with sufficient\r\nuniformity, and presents sufficiently marked typical qualities to\r\nauthorize us in claiming, in favor of its members, the characteristics\r\nand the title of a separate and distinct breed. Consequently, a\r\nStud-book, recording its pedigrees, would not be out of place. This\r\nbook would have the effect of concentrating the efforts of all the\r\nbreeders, giving them a definite direction, and at the same time it\r\nwould designate stallions foreign to the race, and which, up to the\r\npresent time, have been presented with impunity as Percherons.\r\n\r\nEngland exhibits a curious example of the influence of the Stud-book\r\nin the improvement of a breed. The equine and bovine races of that\r\ncountry, before the establishment of the Stud and Herd-books, were but\r\nrudimental.\r\n\r\nThe small number of colts of the Royal mares by Eastern stallions would\r\nhave been lost had they not been classed together in families in a\r\nspecial book.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the value of the bull _Hubback_ would have been to no\r\npurpose had his descendants not been classified by themselves in an\r\nauthentic manner.\r\n\r\nFor it is especially, and only, in the reproduction by family that a\r\nbreed is formed. Consanguinity alone can form, in the beginning, a\r\nbond of cohesion and connection among the descendants of the primitive\r\nfamilies. By it, alone, they acquire that great similarity of shape and\r\nadaptation to particular ends, that great ancestral power, which they\r\ntransmit to their posterity, and which, even in a commercial point of\r\nview, gives them a superior value.\r\n\r\nIf it be permitted me for this purpose to select an example within\r\nour reach among the bovine races, I would say that, in Nivernais the\r\ncelebrated Charollaise breed of cattle, only a few years ago, was\r\ndiffuse, without uniformity, and without commercial value. The idea of\r\nclassifying it by means of a Herd-book was no sooner put in practice\r\nthan good crossings, being all made with system, no longer lost their\r\nsignificance. The breed has visibly improved, and, at present, it has\r\nacquired a value which gives it a rank immediately after the Cotentin.\r\n\r\nThe Stud-book might be established, as we have indicated above, by\r\ninscribing therein all the stallions and mares which had received\r\nprizes for years back, continuing this operation for a dozen years to\r\ncome, and adding therein also the animals which had not taken prizes\r\nor had not been shown in the fairs, but which public attention had\r\nclassed among the number of types valuable on account of the beauty and\r\nsureness of their reproduction.\r\n\r\nParallel to the mode of improvement which I have already shown,\r\n(Chapter 1st, Part Second), and which has as its agents the members\r\nof the Council-boards and the district members of each canton, there\r\nmight be formed, as a means of embracing all, a great annual Department\r\nFair, to be held alternately in the best towns of Perche at the time\r\nof the fairs which attract the most people; in Orne, at Mortagne and\r\nAlençon; at Chartres, Nogent-le-Rotrou, and Chateaudun, for Eure and\r\nLoir; at Vendôme and Montdoubleau for the department of Loir and Cher.\r\nThe departments of the Cote-d’Or, Nievre, and Youne, which possess the\r\nbest Percheron stallions, might likewise enter into the association of\r\nthe Percheron Stud-book, for which they have all the elements.\r\n\r\nThis book would give increased value to the breed, as is easily\r\nunderstood, for it is the surest of all the means of improvement and\r\nperpetuation of valuable qualities. It would drive off, forever, the\r\ndefective stallions, and those corrupted with hereditary blemishes, as\r\nwell as those coming from tainted families, which, I feel sure, would\r\nbe refused a record in its pages. The prices of colts would likewise\r\ngain by this measure, the effect being a powerful impulse given to\r\nbreeding. But it would be necessary to be very careful about ever\r\nadmitting any foreign blood, in order that the recorded herds might\r\naccumulate more and more an ancestral force.\r\n\r\nThe Stud-book would offer still another advantage, that of permitting\r\nus to find again the good types, should Perche some day, in consequence\r\nof bad crossings, or from want of judgment, deviate from the true way.\r\nIn fact, desire of gaining too much and of enjoying too fast at present\r\ntempts every body into innovations. Our age, so eager to enjoy, and\r\nso quick in all enterprises, has no longer the patience to wait for\r\nthe improvements that time and study can alone confirm and solidly\r\nestablish. It wants things off-hand, and for this it is often satisfied\r\nwith adulterated products; hence, these injudicious crossings; hence,\r\nthis mania for mixing together without discernment—a mania which\r\nthreatens to destroy our valuable national breeds.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, the opposition of the army, of the government\r\nstud-stables, and of the trade in heavy horses, bring forth new\r\ncomplications. The army, neither occupied in breeding nor raising, and\r\nnaturally remaining beyond the consequences it causes, encourages these\r\ncrossings, obtaining thereby, more rapidly, the horses it needs. But\r\nhow many of the horses bred by these means are not only unfit for army\r\nservice, but also unfit for any service! Indeed, with a blood stallion\r\nand a common mare, if at the first crossing, among the thin-flanked,\r\nimperfect ones, there happen to be a passable horse, good, and with a\r\ncertain degree of style, ordinarily all progress ends there. For, by\r\nthe use of the latter as a reproducer, an animal ungainly and without\r\nvalue will most certainly be the result, except by chance. The races\r\nof the south affiliate with the Arab, and those of the north with the\r\nEnglish; but the English, by the infusion of his blood, destroys the\r\nrace of the south. This mode of crossing tends, then, to cause our old\r\nFrench races to disappear.\r\n\r\nAt the government studs, with elevated views, and with a\r\ndisinterestedness to which all delight in rendering full justice and\r\nhomage, they constantly encourage the crossings in which they see the\r\nrealization of their views. They offer rewards, the most powerful of\r\nall incentives—giving but very modest prizes to the heavy horses,\r\nproscribing the light coats, and reserving their encouragement for the\r\nlight horses of dark colors.\r\n\r\nAs for the trade, it adopts but slightly the views of the army and the\r\ngovernment stables, and it gives its money to what has remained outside\r\nof these impulses.\r\n\r\nWith the Stud-book we will be able, without giving offence, to\r\nsatisfy the army, the stud-stables, and the trade—the army and the\r\nstud-stables, which want the light, stylish, dark-skinned horse; the\r\ntrade—omnibuses, consumption of the large cities, and agriculture—which\r\nrequire weight, vigor, action, honesty, docility, and endurance.\r\n\r\nThe Stud-book will furnish the means of finding types fit for all\r\nservices. But the breeders will divide themselves into two opposite\r\nparties. Those who wish the dark-skinned, light horse, will breed him\r\non the uplands and in the more barren districts. The others, in the\r\nrich, fertile, and abundant meadows, with a more nutritious food, will\r\napply themselves to the opposite type.\r\n\r\nEach will work in his own sphere; the profits, losses, successes, and\r\nfailures, will soon be summed up, and will soon become, on both sides,\r\nthe object of minute comparisons. If the light horse produce the most\r\nprofit, his empire will soon extend over the domain of the heavy one.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the day of reaction, it be recognized that this crossing is\r\nincapable of ever making a good omnibus, a good shaft, or a good team\r\nhorse; if the crossed breed be set aside for the primitive horse; and\r\nif it come about that the Percheron of pure race is better paid for,\r\nthe fashion will soon return to him. There will the utility of the\r\nStud-book be felt, for it will be by means of the families preserved\r\nauthentically pure, in the cantons which had chosen them, that it will\r\nalone become possible to remold a race, compromised in a moment of\r\nhasty judgment, and render it plentiful upon the market.\r\n\r\nIt would suffice to bring together these types, and encourage the\r\nstart in order to reëstablish Perche in all her glory. They might\r\neven, in the end, bring back to a good condition the lanky race that\r\na better system, a more abundant nourishment, and more appropriate\r\nclassification, would be called on to restore to its primitive form.\r\nSome generations would suffice to restore to it that homogeneousness\r\nthat it formerly possessed, when the post-service required of it its\r\nvigorous and swift mail-coach horses.\r\n\r\nIn summing up, the Stud-book seems to me a useful agent in a triple\r\npoint of view, namely: in the preservation, perfection, and restoration\r\nof the Percheron breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nPreserve the Percheron race as pure as possible from all mixture not\r\nperfectly homogeneous; respect all its varieties due to the districts\r\nwhere they have been bred and raised; improve by crossing the best\r\ntypes of the country, and in such a manner as to correct defects, while\r\npreserving intact qualities and character.\r\n\r\nIf it be necessary to give more style to the action, and more richness\r\nto the blood, ask these qualities of the Arab, which has the privilege\r\nof imparting style and tone, while preserving weight, hardihood, vigor,\r\nand docility. The Arabian is kind, intelligent, reliable, laborious,\r\nand easily kept.\r\n\r\nIf, in obedience to urgent considerations, and in the absence of\r\noriental horses, it becomes necessary to have recourse to English\r\nblood, choose quarter-bred stallions—at the most half-bred—but of an\r\nancient race, and well-confirmed, with a well-opened and expressive\r\neye, fine action, high spirit, and especially a total absence of\r\nirritability, and with all the appearances of honesty and aptitude for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFor the innate defects of the English, generally impressible,\r\nsusceptible, and unintelligent, cannot be too carefully guarded\r\nagainst. Delicate, a great eater, and requiring great care, he must,\r\nif honest, be well worked; if not, he pays ill his cost, and robs the\r\nhand which nourishes him. He should always be selected from a working\r\nfamily, and be himself a free worker. He who wishes to embark in\r\nhorse-breeding will avoid more than one shoal by observing these simple\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThe delicate English horse, fond of his manger, bearing but little\r\ncontinuous and monotonous work, requiring of those that have charge of\r\nhim tact, mildness, and an advanced equestrian education, is the horse\r\nof the rich man, and the man of pleasure, of the lover of the turf and\r\nchase, and of the wealthy farmer, who looks more to the beauty of his\r\nstock than to the quantity of its work.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian, sober, energetic, and laborious, is the horse for the\r\nsmall proprietor, the soldier, and the laborer. He is the wealth of the\r\npoorer and less improved countries.\r\n\r\nThe draft-horse is only suited to the farmer, and his size should be\r\nadapted not only to the district in which he is to be used, but also\r\nto the standard of cultivation of the country, and to the means of the\r\nperson requiring his services. He may be improved, may be a trotter,\r\nand may be more stylish, but should always be adapted to the means\r\nof the breeder, and to the richness of the country. A large and fine\r\nanimal would only vegetate in the hands of a person whose land is\r\nscarcely sufficient to support his family. He should only be owned by\r\nthe wealthy farmer. And, on the other side, the latter should never\r\nraise his eyes to the blood horse, which should be left to those who\r\nhave been a long time accustomed to the risks inseparable from his\r\nbreeding and training.\r\n\r\nA final word will make my thoughts better understood.\r\n\r\nI desire to speak of the financial question, which is every thing\r\nin breeding and in agriculture. The best and the only manner of\r\nconsidering this is to compare the breeder at the start, at the\r\nbeginning of his career, and when his career is ended, to verify the\r\nresults. This operation is nothing short of a settlement of accounts.\r\n\r\nIn my travels I became acquainted with two neighboring districts.\r\nOne was rich, fertile, and productive, eminently suited to breeding\r\nsuperior fancy horses. But they were poorly raised therein; the farmers\r\ndisdained rearing horses suited to the soil, and the horses they did\r\nbreed, already bad from the very start, were raised in idleness, and\r\npoorly fed, on account of their earning nothing. The other district\r\nwas poor, and the soil produced only what could be wrested from it by\r\nforce. However, by dint of labor, agriculture flourished. The horse,\r\nchosen with care, suited the country, worked well, and all prospered.\r\n\r\nThe fancy struck me, to compare the settlements of estates in these two\r\ndistricts, and here are the results of this examination:\r\n\r\nIn the first district, the breeders all commenced and entered upon\r\ntheir career with capital. Notwithstanding this, 18 out of 20 died over\r\nhead and ears in debt.\r\n\r\nIn the second, they were almost all former servants or farm hands,\r\npossessing only their savings, with which to establish themselves. In\r\nspite of these difficult beginnings, 17 out of 20 left fortunes to\r\ntheir children, who, the reverse of the children of the former, were\r\nearly accustomed to labor and to a regular life. It is useless to say\r\nthat in these examples I always excepted the cases where trade, to\r\ncarry on its business, sheltered itself under the cloak of the breeder;\r\nfor this does not constitute breeding any more than the trade in\r\nbread-stuffs carried on in a farm-house constitutes agriculture.\r\n\r\nFinally I would call the attention of the Percheron farmer to two\r\nsuggestions. Suppose the supply of horses from the departments of Orne,\r\nEure and Loir, Loir and Cher, Eure and Sarthe, and from the district of\r\nMortagne, now amounting to about sixty thousand head, should outrun the\r\ndemand of the omnibuses and wagons; the remedy for this would be to aim\r\nat greater style and beauty, at the same time preserving the qualities\r\nrequired by the omnibuses and express companies. We would thus create\r\nanother outlet for our stock, through the demands of the dealers in\r\nfancy horses, and the consumption of the army, and bring the Percheron\r\nrace very near to perfection.\r\n\r\nNo disappointment need be feared in crossing the Percheron with\r\na foreign stallion, either a heavy Arabian, a strong, well-bred\r\nMerlerault, or a dark colored Norfolk, on the express condition that\r\nthis stallion should be selected with care, and be of the best stock of\r\nhis breed. The Arabian can be placed everywhere, both on poor land and\r\nin the hilly districts; where the progeny of the other stallions would\r\nnot thrive, his will succeed well. The get of the Merlerault, and of\r\nthe English horses especially, require the most fertile and the best\r\ncultivated districts.\r\n\r\nIf the results of these crossings, male or female, be successful, they\r\nmay be well employed in breeding, and, after some generations, in the\r\ndistricts where breeding is carried on with care, they may become the\r\nstarting point of a choice stock. Commencing with the qualities of good\r\nand substantial post-horses, the Percheron could be elevated to the\r\ndignity of the carriage-horse, and in other less fertile localities to\r\nstaunch and compact hunters.\r\n\r\nThose showing no improvement, (too many of which are met with) would\r\nfind a market open to them in the trade, among the moderately rich, and\r\nin the army, especially in the artillery. The males, when castrated\r\nat an early age, would be more acceptable to the trade, and, while\r\nceasing to dishonor the privileged class and the class destined for\r\nreproduction, could be used for numerous purposes. For the gray horse\r\nthe outlets are necessarily more limited. When the omnibuses and\r\nteamsters have taken their complement of 6,000 or 7,000 horses, and\r\nwhen the foreigner has gathered up his 600 or 700 choice specimens,\r\nthere no longer remains a sufficient demand for the second-rate stock.\r\n\r\nAs there now exist neither diligences, couriers, mail nor post-coaches,\r\nfor which the gray Percheron was formerly required for the night road\r\nservice, there is no longer any imperious reason for preserving his\r\nold coat; henceforth he may be bay or dark colored. And, provided he\r\nbecomes so by the aid of a dark-coated Arabian, or a heavy, well-bred\r\nMerlerault, or by a fine specimen of a Norfolk, the type of his race, I\r\nsee therein no inconvenience.\r\n\r\nWhen steam machines, to supply the hands which are wanting, will\r\nplow our fields and perform the hardest work, we will have no longer\r\nto regret that our Percheron laborers have not the gray color which\r\npossessed the property of turning the scorching rays of the sun. One\r\nof our greatest writers, one of our lights in equestrian science, has,\r\nhowever, written:\r\n\r\n“The use of stallions of mixed blood, borrowed from foreign races,\r\nleft but regrets in Perche. It has produced vices of disposition and\r\nblemishes which did not belong to the Percheron horse, and has given\r\nhim in exchange no good quality. It has disturbed the structure of the\r\nprogeny without any gain in form or endurance.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all my respect for this high authority, let me be\r\nallowed to ask him if he has ever seen the progeny, too rare it is\r\ntrue, of some well-chosen stallions in close affinity to Percheron\r\nblood, called _Gallipoli_, _Sandy_, and _Bayard_? Never did finer\r\nresults gratify the pride of a breeder, never did trotters drag heavy\r\ndiligences with more power and ease, and never did sons transmit more\r\nfaithfully to their descendants the image and characters of their\r\nancestors. Doubtless he was only shown the numerous and heterogeneous\r\nprogeny of even the best full-blooded stallions _Sylvio_, _Eylau_,\r\n_Reveller_, and others by Percheron mares—crossings so surprising in\r\ntheir absence of affinity that I am still astonished that the thought\r\nof them ever entered a reasonable mind.\r\n\r\nWhen in the absence of stallions of our own, such as we wish, I advise\r\nthe use of foreign ones, I do not give this counsel blindly, but,\r\nselect the types appearing to me the best adapted to the purpose, and\r\ninstead of proceeding with giant strides I would pursue the work with a\r\npatient and prudent slowness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nINFORMATION TO STRANGERS WISHING TO BUY PERCHERON HORSES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nAlthough I consider Perche an exceptional country for the production\r\nof good horses, I attribute to its air, to its water, and to the\r\nnutritiveness of its grasses, the admirable qualities of the animals\r\nbred therein. I am convinced that the excellent care, the wise\r\nmanagement, exempt alike from pampering indulgence and from the harsh\r\ntreatment which irritate the disposition, and from which the good\r\nteacher never departs in his intercourse with his pupils, contribute\r\na great deal to the success of the result. Starting from this point,\r\nI think I can assert that with care and this identical management,\r\nhorses can be elsewhere produced that Perche would not disown. It is,\r\nthen, the recapitulation of this method and management which should be\r\npresented to the stranger desirous of raising the Percheron horse. I\r\nwill tell him what the cultivator of this country does, and in doing\r\nlike him, provided he make the attempt in a high, healthy district, a\r\ndistrict with a sharp air and one often refreshed by winds, presenting\r\nsome analogy to the rugged hills and the excellent grassy valleys\r\nof Perche, no doubt he will arrive at magnificent results. Several\r\nsuppositions may be presented to the consideration of the stranger\r\nwishing to raise Percheron horses. Either he should buy in Perche a\r\nmare in foal, or purchase four or five months’ old colts, which he\r\nwishes to wean in his own country, or his purchases will be made of\r\nyearlings, or, finally, he will carry with him full-grown males and\r\nfemales, or only one or the other sex for the purpose of breeding.\r\n\r\nEach one of these suppositions can be determined by the practical\r\nknowledge of breeding, and by the study of the methods practised in\r\nPerche, and may suggest as many chapters. But, before undertaking\r\nanything, I will ask this amateur if he really loves the horse, and if\r\nhe admits the qualities needed in the Percheron breeder. If he answers\r\nin the affirmative, I will enter upon the subject. If, on the contrary,\r\nhe be not sure of himself and of the agents that he is to employ, I\r\nmight as well throw aside my pen and not write another word.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the Percheron breeder towards his horses is that of\r\na never-changing mildness; and this is why his horse is so gentle and\r\nso docile. The Percheron loves his horse, but not with an affection\r\nresembling that hearty passion, that sudden blaze of regard, too\r\nexplosive to last long, of certain amateurs; he loves the horse with\r\nan hereditary love, a family love, if I may so express it, and the\r\nhorse, on his side, loves him hereditarily. The women and children have\r\ngenerally the care of the horse while the men are in the fields. Hence\r\nthe even and amiable temper of the horses raised under this system.\r\nThe Percheron cultivator possesses, above all, great patience and a\r\nsupreme control over himself, indispensable qualities in training\r\nyoung colts, which, if treated with harshness would soon lose their\r\nheads, and become infallibly nervously timid if subjected to violence\r\nand impatience. Here lies the secret of good training and the art of\r\nuniting in the horse a cool and calm temper with a decided character.\r\nHe is laborious and loves to stir the soil; hence his practice of early\r\nworking the colts, which renders them laborious and honest. But, as\r\nhe is, above all, intelligent and loves in a rational way, he only\r\nrequires of them work in proportion to their strength, and gives them\r\ngood nourishment. This management, uniting work and good food, is an\r\nadmirable means of giving strength, health, and a good constitution.\r\nFinally, the Percheron inhabits a broken country, where he must\r\nconstantly ascend and descend. This circumstance is most favorable in\r\ngiving strength and suppleness to his shoulders, haunches, and hoofs,\r\nwhich, by turns, work and rest in this unparalleled district.\r\n\r\nThis portrait is not only applicable to the large proprietors and to\r\nthe farmers, but to all the Percheron population. There is not a man\r\nin this district who has not been a working man, who has not raised,\r\ntrained, and driven colts, and who, even in his tenderest age, when\r\nhe could walk and hold a little whip, has not lived among the horses\r\nand played between their legs. It requires no searching here to find\r\na man acquainted with the horse, a good farm hand; the first face you\r\nmeet with is that of an intelligent agent, and a trustworthy one in the\r\ndifficult art of training colts.\r\n\r\nIf you have such men at your disposal, undertake boldly your task; but\r\nif the proper men are wanting, forbear, for you will arrive at nothing\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFOOD AND BREEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stallion, in the districts inhabited by mares, is, with some rare\r\nexceptions, a “rover,”—that is to say, he visits the farms at stated\r\nperiods. His standing season lasts six months, from January to July,\r\nand he generally returns four times to the same place. The foal is\r\ndropped, ordinarily, very early, and always in the stable, where it\r\nconstantly remains until weaning time. The dam goes to work every day,\r\nand leaves its foal each morning, to see it again only in the middle of\r\nthe day, and at night. Green clover, or other green forage, is fed, to\r\nkeep up her supply of milk.\r\n\r\nAt six months the colt is weaned. If it be a filly, it remains in the\r\ncanton where it was foaled, to be put to breeding when it reaches the\r\nproper age. If it be a horse colt, it is sold to the farmers of the\r\nraising districts, of which we will speak in the chapter devoted to the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe stock of these districts is recruited from two sources, the\r\nsouthern region principally, (in the vicinity of Montdoubleau and\r\nChateaudun,) on account of the great reputation of its mares. The\r\ncultivator desirous of rearing good colts traverses these districts as\r\nearly as the month of June, and makes his choice of colts from under\r\nthe dams, and out of herds of established reputation. This manner\r\nof selecting stock to raise is the most logical, as also the most\r\nexpensive. It is much in favor with the farmer carrying on a large\r\nbusiness, in the neighborhood of Mauves and Regmalard. Some cultivators\r\nof the other cantons follow his example; but not so rich as he, they\r\nhave but the second choice.\r\n\r\nThe second source, and the most abundant, is the purchase of gang\r\ncolts—that is to say, those which, in Perche, have not been sold during\r\nthe summer; but principally those from the neighborhood of Coulie, to\r\nthe north-west of Maus, and those of Lower Maine. They are brought,\r\nentirely weaned, to the fairs of Perche about the end of autumn. St.\r\nAndrew’s fair at Mortagne offers a curious specimen of this operation.\r\nThe farmers select from the gangs. The origin, in this case, is no\r\nlonger of any account; there is neither sire nor dam to weigh down the\r\nscales; the merit is all exterior—of the individual. If this way of\r\nbuying be not so dear, it is likewise not so sure, unless the purchaser\r\nbe acquainted with honest dealers, accustomed to bring in only good\r\ncolts.\r\n\r\nThere is but little trouble taken in weaning the colts. This passage\r\nfrom one period of life to another, always so serious with thoroughbred\r\ncolts, takes place quite simply with the future field laborers.\r\nThey wean themselves in the trip from their birthplace to their\r\nnew destination. The farmers in the neighborhood of Regmalard, who\r\nordinarily buy them very young, give a little cow’s milk on their\r\narrival, to strengthen them, and to serve as a transition; but even\r\nthis method is far from universal.\r\n\r\nThe colts, when they come upon the farms, are put five or six together,\r\npell-mell, into an indifferently ventilated stable, which receives its\r\nlight through a lattice door. Their nourishment consists of a very thin\r\nmush, made of barley flour and bran, frequently renewed. The solid\r\nportion of their food is composed of dry clover and hay, with which\r\ntheir cribs are regularly filled.\r\n\r\nSome farmers feed aftermath, which is sweeter; but as this is apt to\r\nload the stomach, in order to render it more easily digested, it is\r\nmixed with oat-straw.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare that these colts, changed from one district to another,\r\noften making long stages, and exposed to the inclemencies of the\r\nweather, are not attacked with strangles. Many raisers at this period\r\nhave the pernicious habit of giving them some kind of grain, in order\r\nto warm them up, and cause them to throw off the disease. But this food\r\nhas the fault of thickening the blood too much, and exposes them to\r\nnumerous ailments.\r\n\r\nThis diet is continued until the spring, at which time the colts are\r\ngiven green fodder in the stable. Later, they are turned into the\r\nclover fields after the first cut, or into the meadows after they are\r\nmowed.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen months they commence their apprenticeship; passing their\r\nnecks through the collar, they are harnessed to plows or wagons with\r\nhorses already broken, although of an age at which, in many countries,\r\ntheir equals are as yet ignorant of all labor. The food, composed of\r\nclover principally, hay, millet straw, corn salad, (_Feticus_,) and\r\ncracked rye, baked in loaves, becomes from this time forth, a little\r\nmore nourishing. They also commence to eat oats, but as yet, sparingly.\r\nThis is not given them pure, but with the chaff—that is to say, it is\r\nnot winnowed. The quantity of this food used by day is not less than\r\nto 1½ to 1¾ gallons, yielding not much more than ⅓ of a gallon of\r\noats. On the other hand, the meal and the mush are increased, to give\r\nthem body and strength. At thirty months old they are still kept upon\r\nthis food, in the midst of all the farm work, which they daily perform\r\n(with, however, a great deal of moderation), and in dragging very light\r\nburdens; for, truly, it is but a training, to confirm the hereditary\r\nmildness of their character, and to teach them, little by little, to\r\nbecome willing and fearless.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the dealer, who roams constantly about among the\r\nfarms, arrives. He buys and resells immediately to the farmers of\r\nLittle Perche and Thimerais. More stimulating feed is given them, in\r\nconsequence of more constant and harder work. This life lasts a year,\r\nand is terminated by the passage into Beauce, or the Chartres country,\r\nwhere their work is again increased. With the work the feed increases,\r\nand this combination leads to the perfection of the horse.\r\n\r\nIt is at this time that the horses, having attained their maturity, and\r\nthe maximum of their strength, are bought for Paris, whither they are\r\ncalled by relentless labor, which they are enabled to endure by their\r\nunconquerable will, great muscular force, energy, and courage.\r\n\r\n“This mode of training,” to borrow the words of a noted breeder,\r\n“represents the division of labor, which gives such happy results in\r\nthe manufactories, and its advantages cannot be well appreciated,\r\nexcept by those who, having raised horses, know what embarrassment an\r\nassemblage of colts of all sizes and ages produces. Unfortunately it\r\nwould be very difficult to introduce this excellent custom elsewhere,\r\nwhich has probably existed for ages in Perche without the knowledge of\r\nits source.”\r\n\r\nThe colts destined for breeding are generally devoted to this purpose\r\nat the age of two years, and continue, on an average, until they have\r\nattained the age of four. I speak of Little Perche, for in Great\r\nPerche, since the foundation of the Equestrian Society, the seat\r\nof which is at Chateaudun, and which extends its action to quite a\r\ndistance, the covering is done by adult stallions. At four, they are\r\nsold either to Paris, or to foreigners, should their merit render them\r\nworthy of such a choice.\r\n\r\nThis total emigration of the male colts at the age of six months,\r\nrenders it very difficult to procure good stallions of this breed. From\r\nGreat Perche they are scattered among the trade, often before the age\r\nof a sure selection. When they are sought after in Perche, they are no\r\nlonger to be found; they must then be followed and hunted up on the\r\nBeauce farms, and this pursuit is extremely difficult. It, however,\r\noffers greater chances of success than the Chartres market, where the\r\ngreatest number of mature Percheron horses are to be found.\r\n\r\nAs for the fillies, their experience is the same as that of the colts,\r\nwith this single difference that their life is exempt from migration.\r\nThey are raised in the region in which they are foaled. They work from\r\na very early period, bear two or three colts, and then disappear, like\r\nthe males, in the vortex of consumption. For, beyond some exceptional\r\ncases and remarkable productions, it is rare that they grow old upon\r\nthe farm. The farmer, in order to lose nothing of their value, sends\r\nthem off at the age of five, six, and seven years. It would be a happy\r\nthing, as we have already said, if sufficient inducements in the way\r\nof prizes could be offered to retain the fine breeding mares upon the\r\nsoil, and put an end to this custom, so inimical to progress.\r\n\r\nThe farmers who have pasture grounds, as in the environs of Regmalard,\r\nmake use of them for raising their colts, as is done in Merlerault and\r\nin the Auge Valley. Instead of letting them loose in the fields, they\r\nare sent to pasture.\r\n\r\nThe hay of the valleys is good, but insufficient for the supply of\r\nthe farms; the deficit is made up by the use of artificial fodders,\r\nin which clover enters for three-quarters; the remainder is composed\r\nof fenugreek, lucern, and some roots. Millet, or barley and oat straw\r\nare also given as food, and in certain cantons they are stacked in\r\nalternate layers with the meadow grass, in order to give them the odor\r\nand fragrance of hay—an ingenious method of making an unattractive food\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe stables, although much better than formerly, in the good old times\r\nof the race, still leave a great deal to be desired. They are not\r\nfurnished with stalls, but the horses are tied alongside of one another\r\nwithout any separation. But such is the gentleness of character of this\r\nbreed that an accident was never heard of.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the management which we have just described has a marked\r\ntendency towards constantly enlarging the horse at the expense of his\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nThis diet, completely out of place in a mild, grain producing country,\r\nhas reason for existing in Perche, and the Percheron cultivator knows\r\ntoo well what he does in employing it, not to have understood this.\r\nThe climate and the products of Perche, the air and the water, affect\r\ntoo exclusively the nervous system not to require being constantly\r\ncombatted.\r\n\r\nFor this I desire to take an example in the whole animal kingdom\r\nstocking this country. Everybody to-day well knows the influence of\r\nclimate upon animals. No one now any longer doubts that it is to the\r\nsharp and healthy air of the Percheron country, to its elevated hills,\r\nand to its atmosphere constantly renewed by the powerful ventilators\r\nof its valleys and forests, that this country owes the eminent\r\nqualities of its fine race of horses, which has won for it the right of\r\ndisplaying this significant title: “Perche, the land of good horses.”\r\nEverything surrounding us inclines us to adopt this opinion. The\r\ndomestic animals brought here are transformed in a short time by the\r\ncontact of the air breathed and the nourishment furnished. The marked\r\ntypes of the Billot and Crêvecœur fowls are no sooner brought here than\r\nat the first generation a total change is effected in their looks. From\r\nthe second generation it is difficult to recognize them in the thin,\r\nlean, and nervously formed fowl, with a wild look, and always ready to\r\ntake wing.\r\n\r\nThe bovine race of Perche is also far inferior to the improved race. It\r\nis the opposite of the kind prized nowadays, the race which is mild,\r\nlymphatic, and short-legged, always inclined to fat, and having in its\r\nbony frame only just enough to serve it for its locomotion, forming\r\na quadrilateral of flesh, mounted on four small legs, a rump bending\r\nwith its haunches, a broad, smooth back, and a low brisket. Its horns,\r\nwhich are seemingly useless in a country from which man has driven out\r\nthe wild beasts, fall overlapping one another, like a useless ornament,\r\nupon the head.\r\n\r\nSuch is not the Percheron breed of cattle; on the contrary it is dry\r\nand bony, of a nervous temperament, long legs, angular haunches,\r\ncontracted chest, lank thigh, and thin neck, with a long, thin head.\r\nTwo long horns of a greenish-white stand up in the air, always\r\nthreatening as in a savage country, infested with dangerous animals.\r\nAn expressive word designates them fully: a cattle dealer will tell\r\nyou they are “_staggy_,” and will pass on without bestowing upon them\r\na glance. They are hardly fit for quick fattening, and are recognized\r\nwithout trouble by their color, which in terms of the trade is said to\r\nbe “_a little weak_,” and by their skin, which is dry and harsh. The\r\ndealers appropriately express their condition by “_no good points_.”\r\nThe bulls, especially, are tough, with big horns, bony limbs, large\r\njoints, an ugly head, and the whole difficult to fatten, which well\r\nentitles them to the full application of the epithet “_boorish\r\nbeasts_,” invented to express animals of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain that Maine, the district which joins it, has given to\r\nPerche its race of cattle; they have degenerated, have become taller,\r\nlanker, less easy to fatten, and have preserved no trace of the fine\r\nhead and the good fore-quarters that are to be found in Maine. In\r\nvain has Normandy poured out a generous blood. The Norman type hardly\r\nappears; it is degenerated and entirely loses the agreeable color, fine\r\nhead, good limbs, white horns, and other good points.\r\n\r\nFor several years, the fashion of crossing with the Cotentin race\r\nhas become universal, and continues to make rapid progress. From the\r\nsecond generation, nevertheless, there remains almost nothing in the\r\nconformation and in the quality of the stock to show the cross. It is\r\nonly by dint of always crossing with the Cotentin that Perche has been\r\nable to make for itself her present passable stock.\r\n\r\nThe sheep, sufficiently delicate for the table, are small, and form\r\na degenerate and nameless mixture of the breeds of Maine, Caux, and\r\nTrennes, crossed for several years back with the Merino. They present\r\nthe same conditions as the horned animals. Like them, they are\r\ndifficult to fatten and are not lymphatic, notwithstanding the frequent\r\nimportations of the heavier and fleshier breeds.\r\n\r\nSuch predispositions can only come from the soil, and the constant sway\r\nof the nervous over the lymphatic system produces all the qualities\r\nof the Percheron horse. This is why tradition has painted such a\r\nseductive picture of his construction and qualities. This is why the\r\nold inhabitants, who had seen that fine breed before its degeneration,\r\nspeak of it with so much warmth. This is why, notwithstanding the\r\nincredible crossings, it has withstood such mixtures. And this is why\r\nit is always energetic, in spite of the diluted nourishment without\r\ntonic properties which is given it, and which would be enough to\r\nbastardize a race with characteristics less fixed and permanent.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, beware of utterly condemning the management of the\r\nbreeders, and let us not entangle, with an imprudent hand, the threads\r\nof his traditions. The horse is his sole fortune, and in the raising of\r\nthis aid of his agricultural labors, he gains to-day his livelihood.\r\nHis management has a fixed end to which he always tends with an\r\nincredible perseverance, and that is to increase the size of his horses\r\nwithout prejudice to their good qualities.\r\n\r\nNow that the country is covered with excellent roads and highways;\r\nthat railways have accustomed us to great speed; that diligences and\r\nmail-coaches are forever gone; that the _stylish_ carriage horse, the\r\nhunter, and the half-blood, have reached great perfection, the role\r\nof the Percheron is completely changed. He is no longer the hunter,\r\nthe saddle-horse, nor the motive power of heavy wagons over new and\r\nbroken roads; he remains exclusively both the quick and mettlesome\r\ndraft-horse, and the heavy burden and express wagon horse. He must\r\npossess superior strength, speed, docility, temper, and honesty, and\r\na complete absence of irritability. It is for this reason that after\r\nhaving listened to enthusiastic advisers, and allowed himself to be\r\nled astray by men too eager to enjoy the result of their ideas, he\r\nto-day is no longer to be cajoled by the solicitations of the amateurs\r\nof foreign blood. The Percheron cultivator does not wish even a single\r\ndrop of it, and exerts himself exclusively in producing heavy horses.\r\nEncouraged in this way by the dealers of all countries, paying\r\nexcessively high prices for the big and heavy Percheron horse, while\r\nleaving upon his hands, without the offer of a farthing, the horse in\r\nwhich a few drops of “blood” can be perceived, he has spread his sails\r\nand stretched them boldly to catch the breeze of the day.\r\n\r\nWe shall carefully avoid following the example of numerous famous\r\ndoctors, the display of our little bundle of receipts. Let it be,\r\nhowever, permitted us to touch again slightly upon the question in\r\nexpressing the fear that, should he not take care, the breeder of heavy\r\nhorses will in the end render them too heavy and weighty. Stallions\r\nhaving a small touch of blood, well applied, and sufficiently latent\r\nnot to excite mistrust, having action, good limbs, strong loins, and\r\ndeep chest, are indispensable for warming up the Percheron blood and\r\ngiving it tone. Look at _Sandy_, and afterwards at _Collin_, _Bayard_,\r\nand some others whose influence was immense. Their progeny, magnificent\r\nin every respect, did not show too much blood in their exterior, but\r\nrevealed it vigorously by action and high spirit. The crosses which\r\nhave best succeeded with the Percheron are undoubtedly, as shown by\r\nnumerous examples, those derived themselves from an oriental cross.\r\nThis fact, which clearly proves that the Percheron race has a great\r\naffinity with the race of the desert, should not be neglected in\r\nforeign alliances.\r\n\r\nAs for the English alliances, these have not given as yet all the\r\nresults promised; but from this nothing must be inferred against new\r\ntrials. Too much blood had constantly been used, and consequently the\r\nend was missed by wishing to proceed too rapidly.\r\n\r\nLittle blood, at first, but blood well chosen, from the Norfolk\r\nrace, blood patiently infused into Percheron veins, is the means of\r\ntriumphing over old prejudices and opening to this country an extensive\r\nand successful future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KATE.—MARE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTRADE.—GLANCE AT THE MOST CELEBRATED BREEDING PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good horses are generally bought upon the farms, and among these\r\nthe dealers are constantly roaming. The trade of the whole of France,\r\nand the numerous and intelligent amateurs from abroad, visit them\r\ncarefully, beating the country and searching it in all its farthest\r\ncorners. Still, notwithstanding the purchases there made, the fairs\r\nare not wanting in numerous and good animals. We will, like these\r\nstrangers, run over the best breeding places.\r\n\r\nAs an equine country, “Perche, the land of good horses,” is divided\r\ninto three very distinct districts.\r\n\r\nThat in which the colts are foaled—stocked exclusively with mares and\r\nfillies;\r\n\r\nThe district in which the male colts are weaned and raised;\r\n\r\nAnd that in which they are brought to perfection—a privilege which it\r\nshares with Beauce and the Chartres country which it bounds.\r\n\r\nAll the territory north, west, and south, of the district of Mortagne\r\n(Orne) comprising the cantons of Moulins, Bazoche, Pervenchères,\r\nBellesme, Theil, and part of Nocé, possesses breeding mares as well as\r\nfillies. In Sarthe, the canton of Montmirail; those of Montdoubleau and\r\nDroué in Loir-and-Cher; those of Alluye, Bazoche, Cloyes, Authon, Brou,\r\nand Nogent-le-Rotrou, in Eure-and-Loir, are likewise centers where only\r\nfillies and breeding mares are to be met with. Courtalain, on the south\r\nborder, is also celebrated for this specialty.\r\n\r\nThe raising of male-colts occupies all the east, center, and north\r\nof the district of Mortagne—that is to say, the cantons of Mortagne,\r\nTourouvre, Lougny, Regmalard, and part of Nocé. This division,\r\nhowever, is not always distinctly marked upon the borders. The parishes\r\nupon the confines of each district, such as Bazoches, Courgeoust, Pin,\r\nSaint-Ouen, Nocé, Berdluis, etc., have farms stocked exclusively with\r\nfillies, whilst others possess only stallion colts.\r\n\r\nThe region for the mares is itself divided into two cantons: that of\r\nthe north and that of the south. The southern is the most renowned,\r\ninasmuch as its mares pass for having retained the characters of the\r\nold Percheron race more closely. It comprises the cantons outside the\r\ndistrict of Mortagne. Montdoubleau is the capital.\r\n\r\nThe northern, enclosed in the district of Mortagne, counts three very\r\ndistinct varieties, namely:\r\n\r\nThe pure Percheron races in the south, and in the canton of Bazoches;\r\nin the west, in the parishes which border on Mesle-sur-Sarthe, mares\r\npossessing in various degrees some of English blood, got from the\r\ngovernment stud of Mesle-sur-Sarthe, which is composed exclusively of\r\nthoroughbred stallions; the canton of Moulins, in the north, nourishes\r\nanother high-spirited variety, endowed with excellent action, but\r\ndeficient in height. Accordingly it is more valued for furnishing good\r\nhorses for service than for furnishing ameliorating types.\r\n\r\nThe best centers for stallion colts are: Regmalard, which is, if I\r\nmay so say, the principal place for good stallions; Mauves, which\r\nfurnished, thirty years ago, the famous stallion Jean-le-Blanc, of M.\r\nMiard. For fillies, Villers-en-Ouche, which stocked this country with\r\nmagnificent Percheron mares; Verrieres, Corbon, Comblot, Courgeon,\r\nLoisail, Reveillon and Villiers.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of Perche, it supplies Beauce and the Chartres country,\r\non account of the great similarity existing between them. A country of\r\ntransition, it buys colts to plow the fields, keeps them only a year,\r\nand sells them grown to the cultivators of Beauce, to be sent to\r\nParis after a sojourn of a year or so upon their farms. The environs\r\nof Courville—Chateauneuf, Brézolles, La Loupe, Champroud, Thiron,\r\nPontgouin, Verneuil, etc.—are celebrated for the taste of its farmers\r\nfor fine horses. Illiers, which formerly possessed this specialty, has\r\noccupied itself for several years in weaning colts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSPEED AND BOTTOM OF THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have said that one of the distinctive qualities of the Percheron\r\nhorse, and one which has won for him universal esteem, was fast\r\ntrotting while drawing a heavy load. It would be, however, an error to\r\nsuppose that this faculty of fast trotting puts him on a level with the\r\nblood-horse. The latter draws little, it is true; but he has a long\r\nstride, and, as regards mere speed, he beats the Percheron out and out.\r\nFor the presence upon the turf of such horses as _Décidée_ and _Sarah_,\r\nwho have trotted against blood-horses of the first order, sometimes\r\nhonorably beaten and more often victorious, the presence, I say, of\r\nsuch horses, is but a happy and rare exception.\r\n\r\nThe specialty of the Percheron, quick draft, has then its limits, and\r\nit is these limits that I wish to make known by means of numerous\r\nexamples collected with care.\r\n\r\nWhat the Percheron has done in the diligences, mail and post-coaches is\r\nknown to everybody; and it is useless to repeat it. From one relay to\r\nanother, never dragging less than two, and more often three thousand\r\npounds, in hot weather and cold, and over hilly, difficult roads, he\r\nmade his three leagues to the hour easily, and sometimes four; but\r\nthis was the “_ne plus ultra_,” beyond which it was not reasonable to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nWhat he does in the omnibuses, the world that visits Paris realizes and\r\nadmires. And this is one of the principal attractions of the Percheron\r\nhorse to the intelligent stranger.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to follow him upon the turf and sum up the\r\ntime made in the trots won by him.\r\n\r\nThe courses, for some time frequented by him, are those of Illiers,\r\nCourtalain, Montdoubleau, and Mortagne; and here he is always to be\r\nfound. It is, also, indispensable to notice, in order to be strictly\r\nimpartial, that these tracks, except the new one at Mortagne, finished\r\ntwo years ago, were only plowed fields, hard in dry weather, but cut up\r\nlike a peat-bog in wet times; that the track of Mortagne, as is well\r\nknown, is placed on a steep side-hill, and joins to the above defect\r\nthe one of offering three steep inclines, up and down, like the roof\r\nof a house, within a distance of 3,000 feet. The horses which had done\r\nthe best elsewhere failed on this track, and took a long time to make\r\nthe distance. It is to this circumstance that is to be attributed the\r\nlow average time, but it is this also which shows us the courage of\r\nthe Percheron. When a colt of thirty months (and of these there were\r\na number) had bravely accomplished his task and had gone two or three\r\ntimes around this killing track, it could be boldly predicted that\r\nthere was in him the making of a staunch and valuable horse. To all\r\nthis let us add, that either under saddle or in harness, the Percheron\r\nis almost always placed in an unfavorable situation. Mounted, he is\r\nput into the hands of a youth, ardent, without experience, and without\r\ncalculation, who pushes him without discretion in the beginning, and\r\nis totally ignorant of the jockey’s art. Harnessed, he is covered with\r\nheavy and inconvenient gear, and he drags either a big, heavy-running\r\nwagon, or a poor, low traveling-tilbury.\r\n\r\nThe following list shows the result of 196 trotting matches, officially\r\nreported upon the turf, and two trials to prove bottom, likewise\r\ncertified with care, and will give an average of what the Percheron is\r\ncapable of doing either upon rugged, cut-up, or hilly tracks, or upon\r\nthe highways of a densely populated district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSPEED OF THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTED PERCHERONS.\r\n\r\n1¼ MILES——29 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Julie_, at Montdoubleau, in 1864, time 3\r\nminutes 50 seconds; and of _Godius_, at the same place, in 1857, time 3\r\nminutes 58 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two results are those of _Vidocq_, at Mortagne, 1865, time\r\n7 minutes 37 seconds; and of _Lansquenet_, same place, in 1861, time 7\r\nminutes 48 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe average time of 29 recorded trials is about 4 minutes 12½ seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1⅚ MILES——31 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Vaillante_, at Mortagne, in 1864, time 4\r\nminutes 38 seconds; and of _Julie_, at Montdoubleau, in 1864, time 6\r\nminutes 14 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two are those of _Mouche_, at Mortagne, in 1855, time\r\n9 minutes 18 seconds; and of _Biche_, at Mortagne, in 1855, time 8\r\nminutes 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe average time of 31 trials is about 6 minutes 40 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 MILES——40 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Cocotte_, at Illiers, in 1861, time 6\r\nminutes 5½ seconds; and of _Sarah_, at the same place, in 1865, time 6\r\nminutes 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two are those of _Balzane_, at Illiers, in 1859, time 9\r\nminutes 40 seconds; and of _Renaud_, at the same place, in 1850, time\r\n10 minutes 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe average time of 40 trials is about 7 minutes 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2½ MILES——65 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Sarah_, at Langou, in 1865, time 7 minutes\r\n35 seconds; and of the same at Mortagne, in 1865, time 7 minutes 40\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two are those of _Marmotte_, at Mortagne, in 1865, time 13\r\nminutes 26 seconds; and of _Julie_, at Courtalain, in 1863, time 11\r\nminutes 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe average time of 65 trials is about 9 minutes 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2⅗ miles were made at Illiers, by _Bichette_, in 1860, in 12 minutes 15\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n2⅚ miles at the same place were made three times, and gave an average\r\nof 11 minutes 25 seconds.\r\n\r\n3⅖ miles at the same place were made by _Champion_, in 1857, in 12\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARNESSED PERCHERONS.\r\n\r\n⅞ of a mile was trotted to harness in 1855, at Bethune, by _Grise_, in\r\n4 minutes 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n1¼ miles were made at Mortagne, in 1856, by _Battrape_, in 5 minutes 4\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 MILES——8 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Achille_, at Illiers, in 1865, time 7\r\nminutes 17 seconds; and of _Julie_, at Illiers, in 1863, time 7 minutes\r\n40½ seconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two are those of _Championnet_, at Illiers, 1858, time 7\r\nminutes 53 seconds; and of _Bichette_, at Illiers, in 1849, time 8\r\nminutes 13 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe average of eight trials is about 7 minutes 36 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2½ MILES——14 RESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe best two are those of _Vigoreux_, at Illiers, in 1851, time 8\r\nminutes 30 seconds; and of _Bibi_, at Mortagne, in 1865, time 9 minutes\r\n54 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe poorest two are those of _Bichette_, at Courtalain, in 1860, time\r\n11 minutes 30 seconds; and of _Artagnan_, at Mortagne, in 1850, time 11\r\nminutes 55 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2⅗ MILES——LOADED.\r\n\r\nTwo trials were made at Rouen, by _Décidée_:\r\n\r\nThe first time in 1864, drawing 386 pounds, 2⅗ miles in 9 minutes\r\n21 seconds; the second time, in 1865, drawing 408 pounds the same\r\ndistance, 10 minutes 49 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nENDURANCE OF THE PERCHERON HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gray mare bred by M. Beaulavoris, at Almenesches, (Orne), in 1845,\r\nbelonging to M. Montreuil, horse dealer at Alençon, performed the\r\nfollowing match:—Harnessed to a traveling-tilbury, she started from\r\nBernay at the same time as the mail courier from Rouen to Bordeaux,\r\nand arrived before it at Alençon, having made 55⅗ miles over a hilly\r\nand difficult road, in 4 hours and 24 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis mare is still living, and now belongs to M. Buisson, hotel keeper\r\nat the sign of the White Horse, at Lées, (Orne), where she still draws\r\nthe omnibus plying between the railroad station and the hotel.\r\n\r\nA gray mare 7 years old, belonging to M. Consturier, of\r\nFleury-sur-Andelle, (Eure), in 1864, harnessed to a tilbury, travelled\r\n58 miles and back on two consecutive days, going at a trot and without\r\nbeing touched with the whip. This was over the road from Lyons-la-Foret\r\nfrom Pont Audemer, and back, a difficult and hilly way. The following\r\ntime was made: The first day the distance was trotted in 4 hours, 1\r\nminute, and 35 seconds; the second day, in 4 hours, 1 minute, and 30\r\nseconds. The 13¾ last miles were made _in one hour_, although at about\r\nthe 41st mile the mare was obliged to pass her stable to finish the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  pg 41 Changed: prefering a less showy color\r\n             to: preferring a less showy color\r\n\r\n  pg 57 Changed: If, on the contary\r\n             to: If, on the contrary",
