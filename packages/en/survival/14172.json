Accordingly, the work known as the\r\n_Swiss Family Robinson_ has long enjoyed a well-merited popularity,\r\nand has been perused by a multitude of readers, young and old, with\r\nprofit as well as pleasure.\r\n\r\nA Swiss clergyman resolved to better his fortune by emigration. In\r\nfurtherance of this resolution, he embarked with his wife and four\r\nsons--the latter ranging from eight to fifteen years of age--for one\r\nof the newly-discovered islands in the Pacific Ocean. As far as the\r\ncoast of New Guinea the voyage had been favorable, but here a violent\r\nstorm arose, which drove the ill-fated vessel out of its course, and\r\nfinally cast it a wreck upon an unknown coast. The family succeeded in\r\nextricating themselves from the stranded ship, and landed safely on\r\nshore; but the remaining passengers and crew all perished. For many\r\nyears these six individuals struggled alone against a variety of\r\ntrials and privations, till at length another storm brought the\r\nEnglish despatch-boat _Nelson_ within reach of their signals. Such is\r\na brief outline of the events recorded in the _Swiss Family Robinson_.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is virtually a continuation of this narrative. The\r\ncareers of the four sons--Frank, Ernest, Fritz, and Jack--are taken up\r\nwhere the preceding chronicler left them off. The subsequent\r\nadventures of these four young men, by flood and field, are faithfully\r\ndetailed. With these particulars are mingled the experiences of\r\nanother interesting family that afterwards became dwellers in the same\r\nterritory; as are also the sayings and doings of a weather-beaten\r\nsailor--Willis the Pilot.\r\n\r\nThe scene is laid chiefly in the South Seas, and the narrative\r\nillustrates the geography and ethnology of that section of the\r\nFar-West. The difficulties, dangers, and hardships to be encountered\r\nin founding a new colony are truthfully set forth, whilst it is shown\r\nhow readily these are overcome by perseverance and intelligent labor.\r\nIt will be seen that a liberal education has its uses, even under\r\ncircumstances the least likely to foster the social amenities, and\r\nthat, too, not only as regards the mental well-being of its\r\npossessors, but also as regards augmenting their material comforts.\r\n\r\nIn the _Swiss Family Robinson_ the resources of Natural History have\r\nbeen largely, and perhaps somewhat freely, drawn upon. This branch of\r\nknowledge has, therefore, been left throughout the present volume\r\ncomparatively untouched. Nevertheless, as it is the aim of the\r\nnarrator to combine instruction with amusement, the more elementary\r\nphenomena of the Physical Sciences have been blended with the current\r\nof the story--thus garnishing, as it were, the dry, hard facts of\r\nOwen, Liebig, and Arago, with the more attractive, groupings of life\r\nand action.\r\n\r\nThe reader has, consequently, in hand a _mélange_ of the useful and\r\nagreeable--a little for the grave and a little for the gay--so that,\r\nshould our endeavors to impart instruction prove unavailing, _en\r\nrevanche_ we may, perhaps, be more successful in our efforts to amuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe Colony--Reflections on the Past--Ideas of Willis the

There are, however, many interesting details in their\r\nsubsequent career which have not been made public. These, and the\r\nconversations with which they enlivened the long, dreary days of the\r\nrainy season, we are now about to lay before our readers.\r\n\r\nBecker, his wife, and their four sons had been fifteen years on this\r\nuninhabited coast, when a storm drove the English despatch sloop\r\n_Nelson_ to the same spot. Before this event occurred, the family had\r\ncleared and enclosed a large extent of country; but, whether the\r\nterritory was part of an island or part of a continent, they had not\r\nyet ascertained. The land was naturally fertile; and, amongst other\r\nthings that had been obtained from the wreck of their ship, were\r\nsundry packages of European seeds: the produce of these, together with\r\nthat of two or three heads of cattle they had likewise rescued from\r\nthe wreck, supplied them abundantly with the necessaries of life. They\r\nhad erected dwellings here and there, but chiefly lived in a cave near\r\nthe shore, over the entrance to which they had built a sort of\r\ngallery. This structure, conjointly with the cave, formed a commodious\r\nhabitation, to which they had given the name of _Rockhouse_. In the\r\nvicinity, a stream flowed tranquilly into the sea; this stream they\r\nwere accustomed to call _Jackal River_, because, a few days after\r\ntheir landing, they had encountered some of these animals on its\r\nbanks. Fronting Rockhouse the coast curved inwards, the headlands on\r\neither side enclosing a portion of the ocean; to this inlet they had\r\ngiven the name of _Safety Bay_, because it was here they first felt\r\nthemselves secure after having escaped the dangers of the storm. In\r\nthe centre of the bay there was a small island which they called\r\n_Shark's Island_, to commemorate the capture of one of those monsters\r\nof the deep. Safely Bay, had, a second time, acquired a legitimate\r\ntitle to its name, for in it Providence had brought the _Nelson_\r\nsafely to anchor.\r\n\r\nBy unwearying perseverance, indefatigable industry, and an untiring\r\nreliance on the goodness of God, Becker and his family had surrounded\r\nthemselves with abundance. There was only one thing left for them to\r\ndesire, and that was the means of communicating with their kindred;\r\nand now this one wish of their hearts was gratified by the unexpected\r\nappearance of the _Nelson_ on their shore. The fifteen years of exile\r\nthey had so patiently endured was at once forgotten. Every bosom was\r\nfilled with boundless joy; so true it is, that man only requires a ray\r\nof sunshine to change his most poignant griefs into smiles and\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\nThe first impressions of their deliverance awakened in the minds of\r\nthe young people a flood of projects. The mute whisperings that\r\nmurmured within them had divulged to their understandings that they\r\nwere created for a wider sphere than that in which they had hitherto\r\nbeen confined. Europe and its wonders--society, with its endearing\r\ninterchanges of affection--that vast panorama of the arts and of\r\ncivilization, of the trivial and the sublime, of the beautiful and\r\nterrible, that is called the world--came vividly into their thoughts.\r\nThey felt as a man would feel when dazzled all at once by a spectacle,\r\nthe splendor of which the eyes and the mind can only withstand by\r\ndegrees. They had spelt life in the horn-book of true and simple\r\nnature--they were now about to read it fluently in the gilded volume\r\nof a nature false and vitiated, perhaps to regret their former\r\ntranquil ignorance.\r\n\r\nBecker himself had, for an instant, given way to the general\r\nenthusiasm, but reflection soon regained her sway; he asked himself\r\nwhether he had solid reasons for wishing to return to Europe, whether\r\nit would be advisable to relinquish a certain livelihood, and abandon\r\na spot that God appeared to bless beyond all others, to run after the\r\ndoubtful advantages of civilized society.\r\n\r\nHis wife desired nothing better than to end her days there, under the\r\nbeautiful sky, where, from the bosom of the tempest, they had been\r\nguided by the merciful will of Him who is the source of all things.\r\nStill the solitude frightened her for her children. \"Might it not,\"\r\nshe asked herself, \"be egotism to imprison their young lives in the\r\nnarrow limits of maternal affection?\" It occurred to her that the\r\ndangers to which they were constantly exposed might remove them from\r\nher; to-day this one, to-morrow another; what, then, would be her own\r\ndesolation, when there remained to her no bosom on which to rest her\r\nhead--no heart to beat in unison with her own--no kindly hand to\r\ngrasp--and no friendly voice to pray at her pillow, when she was\r\ncalled away in her turn!\r\n\r\nAt length, after mature deliberation, it was resolved that Becker\r\nhimself, his wife, Fritz and Jack, two of their sons, should remain\r\nwhere they were, whilst the two other young men should return to\r\nEurope with a cargo of cochineal, pearls, coral, nutmegs, and other\r\narticles that the country produced of value in a commercial point of\r\nview. It was, however, understood that one of the two should return\r\nagain as soon as possible, and bring back with him any of his\r\ncountrymen who might be induced to become settlers in this land of\r\npromise, Becker hoping, by this means, to found a new colony which\r\nmight afterwards flourish under the name of _New Switzerland_. The\r\nmission to Europe was formally confided to Frank and Ernest, the two\r\nmost sedate of the family.\r\n\r\nBesides the captain and crew, there was on board the ship now riding\r\nat anchor in the bay a passenger, named Wolston, with his wife and two\r\ndaughters. This gentleman was on his way to join his son at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, but had been taken seriously ill previous to the\r\n_Nelsons_ arrival on the coast. He and his family were invited on\r\nshore by Becker, and had taken up their quarters at Rockhouse.\r\nWolston was an engineer by profession, but his wife belonged to a\r\nhighly aristocratic family of the West of England; she had been\r\nbrought up in a state of ease and refinement, was possessed of all the\r\naccomplishments required in fashionable society, but she was at the\r\nsame time gifted with strong good sense, and could readily accommodate\r\nherself to the circumstances in which she was now placed. Her two\r\ndaughters, Sophia the youngest, a lively child of thirteen, and Mary\r\nthe eldest, a demure girl of sixteen, had been likewise carefully, but\r\nsomewhat elaborately, educated. Attracted no less by the hearty and\r\nwarm reception of the Swiss family, than determined by the state of\r\nhis health and the pure air of the country, Wolston resolved to await\r\nthere the return of the sloop, the official destination of which was\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, where it had to land despatches from Sidney.\r\n\r\nCaptain Littlestone, of H.B.M.'s sloop _Nelson_, had kindly consented\r\nto all these arrangements; he agreed to convey Ernest and Frank Becker\r\nand their cargo to the Cape, to aid them there with his experience,\r\nand, finally, to recommend them to some trustworthy correspondents he\r\nhad at Liverpool. He likewise promised to bring back young Wolston\r\nwith him on his return voyage.\r\n\r\nEverything being prepared, the departure was fixed for the next day:\r\nthe sloop, with the blue Peter at the fore, was ready, as soon as the\r\nanchor was weighed, to continue her voyage. The cargo had been stowed\r\nunder hatches. Becker had just given the farewell dinner to Captain\r\nLittlestone and Lieutenant Dunsley, his second in command. These two\r\ngentlemen had discreetly taken their leave, not to interrupt by their\r\npresence the final embraces of the family, the ties of which, after so\r\nmany long years of labor and hardship, were for the first time to be\r\nbroken asunder.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage, Wolston had formed an intimacy with the boatswain\r\nof the _Nelson_, named Willis, and he, on his side, held Wolston and\r\nhis family in high esteem. Willis was likewise a great favorite with\r\nhis captain--they had served in the same ship together when boys;\r\nWillis was known to be a first-rate seaman; so great, indeed, was his\r\nskill in steering amongst reefs and shoals, that he was familiarly\r\nstyled the \"Pilot,\" by which cognomen he was better known on board\r\nthan any other. At the particular request of Wolston, who had some\r\ncommunications to make to him respecting his son, Willis remained on\r\nshore, the captain promising to send his gig for him and his two\r\npassengers the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhilst Wolston was busy charging the pilot with a multitude of\r\nmessages for his son, Mrs. Becker was invoking the blessings of Heaven\r\nupon the heads of her two boys; praying that the hour might be\r\ndeferred that was to separate her from these idols of her soul. Becker\r\nhimself, upon whom his position, as head of the family, imposed the\r\nobligation of exhibiting, at least outwardly, more courage, instilled\r\ninto their minds such principles of truth and rules of conduct as the\r\nsolemnity of the moment was calculated to engrave on their hearts.\r\n\r\nThe dial now marked three o'clock, tropical time. Willis, wiping, with\r\nthe cuff of his jacket, a drop that trickled from the corner of his\r\neye, laid hold of his seal-skin sou'-wester as a signal of immediate\r\ndeparture. Ernest and Frank were bending their heads to receive the\r\nparting benediction of their parents, when suddenly a fierce torrent\r\nof wind shook the gallery of Rockhouse to its foundation, and uprooted\r\nsome of the bamboo columns by which it was supported.\r\n\r\n\"Only a squall,\" said Willis quietly.\r\n\r\n\"A squall!\" exclaimed Becker, \"what do you call a hurricane then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a hurricane, I mean a downright reefer, all square and\r\nclose-hauled, that is a very different affair; but, after all, this\r\nbegins to look very like the real article.\"\r\n\r\nNow came a succession of gusts, each succeeding one more powerful than\r\nits predecessor, till every beam of the gallery bent and quivered;\r\ndense copper-colored clouds appeared in the atmosphere, rolling\r\nagainst each other, and disengaging by their shock, the thunder and\r\nlightnings. Then fell, not the slender needles of water we call rain,\r\nbut veritable floods, that were to our heaviest European showers what\r\nthe cataracts of the Rhine, at Staubach, or the falls of Niagara, are\r\nto the gushings of a sylvan rivulet. In a few minutes the Jackal river\r\nhad converted the valley into a lake, in which the plantations and\r\nbuildings appeared to be afloat, and rendering egress from Rockhouse\r\nnearly impossible.\r\n\r\nHowever much of a colorist Willis might be, he could not have painted\r\na storm with the eloquence of the elements that had cut short his\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"You will not attempt to embark in weather like this?\" inquired Mrs.\r\nBecker anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"My duty it is to be on board,\" replied the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"The craft that ventures to take you there will get swamped twenty\r\ntimes on the way,\" observed Becker.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of it is, the wind is from the east, and evidently carries\r\nwaterspouts with it. These waterspouts strike a ship without the\r\nslightest warning, play amongst the rigging, whirl the sails about\r\nlike feathers--sometimes carry them off bodily, or, if they do not do\r\nthat, tear them to shreds and shiver the masts. In either case, the\r\nconsequences are disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\n\"A reason for you to be thankful you are safe on shore with us!\"\r\nremarked Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well for you, Mrs. Wolston, and you, Mrs. Becker, to\r\ntalk in that way; your business in life is that of wives and mothers.\r\nBut what will the Lords of the Admiralty say, when they hear that the\r\nsloop _Nelson_ was wrecked whilst Master Willis, the boatswain, was\r\nskulking on shore like a land-rat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they would only say there was one useful man more, and a victim\r\nthe less,\" replied Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Why, not exactly, Master Fritz; they would say that Willis was a\r\npoltroon or a deserter, whichever he likes; they would very likely\r\ncondemn him to the yard-arm by default, and carry out the operation\r\nwhen they get hold of him. But I will not endanger any one else; all I\r\nwant is the use of your canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! brave this storm in a wretched seal-skin cockle-shell like\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be offending Providence,\" hazarded Mary Wolston, \"for\r\none of God's creatures to abandon himself to certain death?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would, indeed,\" added Mrs. Wolston; \"true courage consists in\r\nfacing danger when it is inevitable, but not in uselessly imperiling\r\none's life; there stops courage, and temerity begins.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is not pride or folly. I do not mean that with reference to\r\nyou, Willis,\" hastily added Wolston; \"I know that you are open as day,\r\nand that all your impulses arise from the heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very fine--but I must act; let me have the canoe. I want\r\nthe canoe: that is my idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having lived fifteen years cut off from society,\" gravely observed\r\nBecker, \"it may be that I have forgotten some of the laws it imposes;\r\nnevertheless, I declare upon my honor and conscience--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me have the canoe, otherwise I must swim to the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare,\" continued Becker, \"that Willis exaggerates the\r\nrequirements of his duty. There are stronger forces to which the human\r\nwill must yield. It is one thing to desert one's post in the hour of\r\ndanger, and another to have come on shore at the express desire of a\r\nsuperior officer, when the weather was fine, and nothing presaged a\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is danger,\" continued the obstinate sailor, whom the united\r\nstrength of the four men could scarcely restrain, \"I ought to share\r\nit; that is my duty and I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Wolston, \"all the boatswains and pilots in the world can\r\ndo nothing against hurricanes and waterspouts; their duty consists in\r\nsteering the ship clear of reefs and quicksands, and not in fighting\r\nwith the elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing you forget, Mr. Wolston.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to be side by side with your comrades in the hour of calamity,\r\nto aid them if you can, and to perish with them if such be the will of\r\nFate. At this moment, poor Littlestone may be on the point of taking\r\nup his winter quarters in the body of a shark. But there, if the\r\nsloop is lost while I am here on shore, I will not survive her; all\r\nthat you can say or do will not prevent me doing myself justice.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jack, who had disappeared during this discussion,\r\nunobserved, came in saturated to the skin with water, and in a state\r\ndifficult to describe. Like the boots of Panurge, his feet were\r\nfloating in the water that flowed from the rim of his cap.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" exclaimed his mother. \"You wilful boy, may I ask\r\nwhere, in all the world, you have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just come from the bay. O father and mother! O Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWolston! O Master Willis! if you had only seen! The sea is furious;\r\nsometimes the waves rise to the skies and mingle with the clouds, so\r\nthat it is impossible to say where the one begins and the other ends.\r\nIt is frightful, but it is magnificent!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the sloop?\" demanded Willis.\r\n\r\n\"She is not to be seen; she is no longer at anchor in the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone to the open sea, to avoid being driven ashore,\" said Wolston.\r\n\"Captain Littlestone is not the man to remain in a perilous position\r\nwhilst there remained a means of escape; besides, nothing that\r\nscience, united with courage and presence of mind, could do, would\r\nhave been neglected by him to save his ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"In addition to which,\" observed Becker, \"if he had found himself in\r\npositive danger, he would have fired a gun; and in that case, though\r\nwe are not pilots, every one of us would have hastened to his\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Willis,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"God comes to ease your mind;\r\nwere we to allow you to go to the sloop now, the thing is simply\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my own idea about that,\" insisted Willis, whilst he kept\r\nbeating a tatoo on the isinglass window panes.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus chafing like a caged lion, Wolston's youngest daughter\r\nwent towards him, and gently putting her hand in his, said,\r\n\"Sweetheart\" (for so she had been accustomed to address him), \"do you\r\nremember when, during the voyage, you used to look at me very closely,\r\nand that one evening I went boldly up to you and asked you why you\r\ndid so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Sophia, I recollect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the answer you gave me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I told you that I had left in England, on her mother's bosom, a\r\nlittle girl who would now be about your own age, and that I could not\r\nobserve the wind play amongst the curls of your fair hair without\r\nthinking of her, and that it sometimes made my breast swell like the\r\nmizen-top-sail before the breeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and when I promised to keep out of your sight, not to reawaken\r\nyour grief, you told me it was a kind of grief that did you more good\r\nthan harm, and that the more it made you grieve, the happier you would\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"All true:\" replied the sailor, whose excitement was melting away\r\nbefore the soft tones of the child like hoar frost in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"Then I promised to come and talk to you about your Susan every day;\r\nand did I not keep my word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Miss Sophia; and it is only bare justice to say that you\r\ngracefully yielded to all my fatherly whims, and even went so far as\r\nto wear a brown dress oftener than another, because I said that my\r\nlittle Susan wore that color the last time I kissed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but that is a secret, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I am going to tell all our secrets--that is an idea of mine.\r\nYou then went and learned Susan's mother's favorite song, with which\r\nyou would sometimes sing me to sleep, like a great baby that I am, and\r\nmake me fancy that I was surrounded by my wife and daughter, and was\r\ncomfortably smoking my pipe in my own cottage, with a glass of grog at\r\nmy elbow.\"\r\n\r\nWillis said this so earnestly, that the smile called forth by the\r\noddness of the remark scarcely dared to show itself on the lips of the\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" resumed the little damsel, \"if you are not more\r\nreasonable, and if you keep talking of throwing your life away, I will\r\nnever again place my hand in yours as now; I shall not love you any\r\nmore, and shall find means of letting Susan's mother know that you\r\nwent away and killed yourself, and made her a widow.\"\r\n\r\nMen can only speak coldly and appeal to reason--logic is their panacea\r\nin argument. Women alone possess those inspirations, those simple\r\nwords without emphasis, that find their way directly to the heart, and\r\nfor which purpose God has doubtless endowed them with those soft, mild\r\ntones, whose melodies cause our most cherished resolutions to vanish\r\nin the air; like those massive stone gates we have seen in some of the\r\nold castles in Germany, that resist the most powerful effort to push\r\nthem open, but which a spring of the simplest construction causes to\r\nmove gently on their formidable hinges.\r\n\r\nWillis was silent; but no openly-expressed submission could have been\r\nmore eloquent than this mute acquiescence.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the tempest raged with increased fury, the winds\r\nhowled, and the water splashed; it appeared at each shock as if the\r\nelements had reached the utmost limit of the terrific; that the sea,\r\nas the poet says, had lashed itself into exhaustion! But, anon, there\r\ncame another outburst more terrible still, to declare that, in his\r\nanger as in his blessings, the All-Powerful has no other limit than\r\nthe infinite.\r\n\r\n\"If it is not in the power of human beings to aid the crew of the\r\n_Nelson_,\" said Mrs. Becker kneeling, \"there are other means more\r\nefficacious which we are guilty in not having sought before.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one followed this example, and it was a touching scene to behold\r\nthe rough sailor yield submissively to the gentle violence of the\r\nchild's hand, and bend his bronzed and swarthy visage humbly beside\r\nher cherub head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTO WHAT EXTENT WILLIS THE PILOT HAD IDEAS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS--THE\r\nKNIGHTS OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm continued to rage without intermission for three entire\r\ndays. During this interval, not only was it impossible to send the\r\ncanoe or pinnace to sea, but even to venture a step beyond the\r\nthreshold, so completely had the tempest broken up the burning soil,\r\nthe thirst of which the great Disposer of all things had proportioned\r\nto the deluges that were destined to assuage it.\r\n\r\nAll had at length yielded to bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, for\r\nthe seeming eternity of these three days and three nights had been\r\npassed in prayer, and in the most fearful apprehensions as to the fate\r\nof the _Nelson_ and her crew.\r\n\r\nNothing in the horizon as yet indicated that the thunders were tired\r\nof roaring, the clouds of rending themselves asunder, the winds of\r\nhowling, or the waves of frantically beating on the cliffs.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the ladies had retired to the sick-room with a view of\r\nseeking some repose. Becker, Willis, and the young men bivouacked in\r\nthe hall, where some mattresses and bear-skins had been laid down.\r\nHere it was arranged that, for the common safety, each during the\r\nnight should watch in turn. But about two in the morning, Ernest had\r\nno sooner relieved Fritz than, fatigue overcoming his sense of duty,\r\nthe poor fellow fell comfortably asleep, and he was soon perfectly\r\nunconscious of all that was passing around him.\r\n\r\nBecker awoke first--it was broad daylight. \"Where is Willis?\" he\r\ncried, on getting up.\r\n\r\n\"Holloa!\" exclaimed Fritz, running towards the magazine, \"the canoe\r\nhas disappeared!\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant all were on their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Some one of you has fallen asleep then,\" said Becker to his children;\r\n\"for when the pilot watched I watched with him, and never lost sight\r\nof him for a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the culprit,\" said Ernest; \"and if any mischief arises out of\r\nthis imprudence, I shall never forgive myself. But who could have\r\ndreamt of any one being foolhardy enough to attempt the rescue of a\r\nship in a nutshell that scarcely holds two persons?\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray Heaven that your sleepy-headedness may not result in the loss\r\nof human life! You see, my son, that there is no amount of duty, be it\r\never so trifling in importance, that can be neglected with impunity.\r\nIt is the concurrent devotion of each, and the sacrifices of one for\r\nanother, that constitutes and secures the mutual security. Society on\r\na small, as on a large scale, is a chain of which each individual is a\r\nlink, and when one fails the whole is broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go after him,\" said Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"Fritz and I will go with you,\" added Frank.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Ernest; \"I alone am guilty, and I wish alone to remedy my\r\nfault--that is, as far as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not hide the canoe,\" observed Fritz, \"but I hid the oars, and\r\nI find them in their place.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, perhaps, will have prevented him embarking,\" remarked one of\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\n\"A man like Willis,\" replied Becker, \"is not prevented carrying out\r\nhis intentions by such obstacles; he will have taken the first thing\r\nthat came to hand; but let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, father, am I not then to go alone, and so bear the penalty of\r\nmy own fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ernest, that would be to inflict two evils upon us instead of\r\none; it is sufficient that you have shown your willingness to do so.\r\nBesides, three will not be over many _to convince_ Willis, even if yet\r\nin time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mother? and the ladies?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"I shall leave Frank and Jack to see to them; a mere obstinate freak,\r\nor a catastrophe, it will be time enough, when over, to inform them of\r\nthis new idea of the Pilot's.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is something more than an idea this time,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\nJust as Becker and his two sons were issuing from the grotto, the\r\nreport of a cannon-shot resounded through the air.\r\n\r\nAwoke and startled by the explosion, Becker's wife and Mrs. Wolston\r\ncame running towards them. As for the girls, their guardian angel had\r\ntoo closely enveloped them in its wings to admit of their sleep being\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"The sloop on the coast!\" said Frank; \"for the sound is too distinct\r\nto come from a distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless Willis has got upon Shark's Island,\" objected Fritz, running\r\ntowards the terrace, armed with a telescope. \"Just so; he is there, I\r\nsee him distinctly; he is recharging our four-pounder.\"\r\n\r\n\"God be praised! you relieve my conscience of a great burden,\" said\r\nErnest, placing his hand on his breast.\r\n\r\n\"He is going to discharge it,\" cried Fritz--boom. Then a second shot\r\nreverberated in the air.\r\n\r\n\"If Captain Littlestone be within hearing of that signal, he will be\r\nsure to reply to it.\" said Becker. \"Listen!\"\r\n\r\nThey hushed themselves in silence, each retaining his respiration, as\r\nif their object had been to hear the sound of a fly's wing rather than\r\nthe report of a cannon.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" said Becker sadly, at the expiration of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" reiterated successively all the voices.\r\n\r\n\"How in all the world did Willis contrive to get transported to\r\nShark's Island?\" inquired Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"Simply, wife, by watching when asleep, whilst one of our gentlemen\r\nslept when he watched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" said Ernest, \"and if you would not have me blush before\r\nMrs. Wolston, you will not insist upon an explanation of the mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Wolston,\" she replied, \"is not so exacting as you seem to think,\r\nMaster Ernest--the only difference that her presence here should make\r\namongst you is that you have two mothers instead of one.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" said Mrs. Wolston smiling, \"if Mrs. Becker has no\r\nobjections to dividing the office with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I not have compensation in your daughters?\" said Mrs. Becker,\r\ntaking her by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" interrupted Fritz, \"I cannot yet conceive how Willis managed\r\nto reach Shark's Island in a wretched canoe, without oars, through\r\nwaves that ought to have swallowed him up over and over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Jack; \"what use has a pilot for oars?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a question! You, who modestly call yourself the best\r\nhorseman on the island, how would you do, if you had nothing to ride\r\nupon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could at least fall back upon broomsticks,\" retorted the\r\nimperturbable Jack. \"Besides, in Willis's case, the canoe was the\r\nsteed, the oars the saddle--nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not stay here to solve the riddle,\" said Becker; \"the storm\r\nseems disposed to abate; and the more that it was unreasonable to face\r\ncertain destruction in a vain endeavor to assist a problematical\r\nshipwreck, the more it is incumbent upon us now to go in quest of the\r\n_Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sea will still be very terrible!\" quickly added Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"If all danger were over, wife, the enterprise would do us little\r\ncredit. It is our duty to do the best we can, according to the\r\nstrength and means at our command. Fritz, Ernest, and Jack, go and put\r\non your life-preservers--we shall take up Willis in passing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not insist,\" said Mrs. Becker; \"the sacrifice would, indeed,\r\nbe no sacrifice, if it could be easily borne; and yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember the time, wife, when I was obliged, in order to secure the\r\nprecious remains of our ship, to venture with our eldest sons on a\r\nfloat of tubs, leaving you exposed, alone with a child of seven, to\r\nthe chance of eternal isolation!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true, husband: I am unjust towards Providence, which has\r\nnever ceased blessing us; but I am only a weak woman, and my heart\r\noften gets the better of my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day I leave Frank with you; but, instead of your being his\r\nprotector, as was the case fifteen years ago, he will be yours. Then\r\nthere is Mrs. Wolston, her daughters, and husband, quite a new world\r\nof sympathies and consolations, by which our island has been so\r\nmiraculously peopled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go then, husband, and may God bring back in safety both the pinnace\r\nand the _Nelson_!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Mrs. Wolston, how does our worthy invalid get on? We live\r\nin such a turmoil of events and consternations, that I must beg a\r\nthousand pardons for not having asked after him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"His sleep appears untroubled; and, notwithstanding all the terrors of\r\nthe last few days, I entertain sanguine hopes of his immediate\r\nrecovery.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will at least return before night?\" said Mrs. Becker to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Rely upon my not prolonging my stay beyond what the exigencies of the\r\nexpedition imperiously require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! what are these?\" exclaimed Mrs. Wolston as the three\r\nbrothers entered, equipped in seal-gut trowsers, floating stays of the\r\nsame material, and Greenland caps.\r\n\r\n\"The Knights of the Ocean,\" replied Jack gravely, \"who, like the\r\nheroes of Cervantes, go forth to redress the wrongs done by the\r\ntempest, and to break lances--oars, I mean--in favor of persecuted\r\nsloops.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Becker herself could scarcely refrain from smiling.\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of the smile that, in season or out of season, it\r\noften finds its way to the most pallid lips, in the midst of the\r\ngreatest disasters and the deepest grief. It appears as if always\r\nlistening at the door ready to take its place on the slightest notice.\r\nThis diversion had the good effect of mixing a little honey with--if\r\nthe expression may be used--the bitterness of the parting adieus.\r\nBecker took the lead in hiding his sorrow; the three young\r\nGreenlanders tore themselves from the maternal embrace, and\r\naffectionately kissed the hand held out to them by Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\nThen, between those that departed and those that remained behind,\r\nthere was nothing more than the ties of recollection, the common\r\nsadness, and the endless links of mutual affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHEREIN WILLIS THE PILOT PROVES \"IRREFRAGABLY\" THAT EPHEMERIDES DIE OF\r\nCONSUMPTION AND HOME-SICKNESS--THE CANOE AND ITS YOUNG ONES--THE\r\nSEARCH AFTER THE SLOOP--FOUND--THE SWORD-FISH--FLOATING ATOMS--ADMIRAL\r\nSOCRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had come within a short distance of the bay, Jack thought he\r\nsaw a large black creature moving in the bushes that lined the shore.\r\n\r\n\"A sea monster!\" he cried, levelling his musket; \"I discovered it, and\r\nhave the right to the first shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Fritz, whose keen eye was a sort of locomotive\r\ntelescope, \"I object to that, for I do not want you to kill or wound\r\nmy canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, it moves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether it moves or not, we shall all see by and by; but do you not\r\nobserve this monster's young ones gambolling by its side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which proves I am right, unless you mean to say your canoe has been\r\nhatching,\" and Jack again levelled his rifle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire, it is the hat and jacket of Willis!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Ernest, \"is the Pilot a triton then, that he could\r\ndispense with the canoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, unless the canoe has found its way back of its own accord,\r\nwhich would indeed make it an intelligent creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Pilot has evidently reached Shark's Island by swimming, in spite\r\nof surf and breakers--a feat almost without a parallel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Ernest, parodying Jack's witticism about the oars, \"what\r\ndoes a pilot care about surf and breakers?\"\r\n\r\nStrongly moored in a creek of the Jackal River, and protected by a\r\nbluff, forming a screen between it and the sea, the pinnace had in no\r\nway suffered from the storm.\r\n\r\nThe swell was so violent, that they had a world of trouble in making\r\nthe island; as they approached, Willis, who had made a speaking-trumpet\r\nby joining his hands round his mouth, was roaring out alternately,\r\n\"starboard,\" \"larboard,\" \"hard-a-port,\" just as if these terms had\r\nnot been Hebrew to the impromptu mariners.\r\n\r\nAt last, tired of holloaing, \"Stop a bit,\" he said, \"I shall find a\r\nquicker way;\" with that he threw himself directly into the sea, and\r\ncut through the waves towards them as if his arms had been driven by a\r\nsteam engine.\r\n\r\nArrived on board, he gave a vigorous turn to the tiller, laid hold of\r\nthe sheet, let out a reef here, took in another there; the pinnace was\r\nsoon completely at his command, and behaved admirably; true, she\r\npitched furiously, and the gunwale was under water at every plunge. He\r\nheaded along the coast till the point beyond which Fritz had first\r\nobserved the _Nelson_ was fairly doubled; some days before this point\r\nwas called Cape Deliverance, it was now, perhaps, about to acquire the\r\nterm of Cape Disappointment, but for the moment its future designation\r\nwas in embryo.\r\n\r\nLeaping on the poop, Willis carefully scanned the horizon as the boat\r\nrose upon the summit of the waves; but seeing nothing, he at last\r\nleapt down again with an expression of rage that, under other\r\ncircumstances, would have been irresistibly comic. Abandoning the\r\ndirection of the pinnace, he went and sat down on a bulk-head, and\r\ncovered his face with his hands, in an attitude of profound\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n\"Willis! Willis!\" cried Jack, \"I shall tell Sophia.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was neither the soft voice there, the caressing hand, nor\r\nthe sweet fascination of the young girl's presence, and Willis\r\ncontinued immovable.\r\n\r\nBecker saw that his was one of those minds that grew less calm the\r\nmore they were urged, and the excitement of which must be permitted to\r\nwear itself out; he therefore beckoned his sons to leave him to his\r\nown reflections.\r\n\r\nThe wind still blew a gale, and the pinnace pitched heavily; but the\r\nsun was now beginning to break through the masses of lurid cloud, and\r\nthe air was becoming less and less charged with vapor.\r\n\r\n\"I can descry nothing either,\" said Becker; \"and yet this is the\r\ndirection the storm must have driven the sloop.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea is very capricious,\" suggested Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"True, but not to the extent of carrying a ship against the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Jack, \"it is not on sea as on land, where the\r\nslightest indications of an object lost may lead to its discovery; a\r\nword dropped in the ear of a passer-by might put you on the track, but\r\nhere it is no use saying, 'Sir, did you not see the _Nelson_ pass this\r\nway?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire a shot,\" said Ernest; \"it may perhaps be heard, now that the air\r\nis less humid.\"\r\n\r\nThe two-pounder was ready charged; Fritz struck a light and set fire\r\nto a strip of mimosa bark, with which he touched the piece, and the\r\nreport boomed across the waters.\r\n\r\nWillis raised his head and listened anxiously, but soon dropped it\r\nagain, and resumed his former attitude of hopeless despair.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" said Ernest, \"that the _Nelson_ hears our signal, though\r\nwe do not hear hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Why, very easily. Sound increases or diminishes in intensity\r\naccording as the wind carries it on or retards it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is sound, that the wind can blow it about, most learned\r\nbrother?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a result of the compression of the air, that from its\r\nelasticity extends and expands, and which causes a sort of trembling\r\nor undulation, similar to that which is observed in water when a stone\r\nis thrown into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may add,\" said Becker, \"that bodies striking the air excite\r\nsonorous vibrations in this fluid; thus it rings under the lash that\r\nstrikes it with violence, and whistles under the rapid impulsion of a\r\nswitch: it likewise becomes sonorous when it strikes itself with force\r\nagainst any solid body, as the wind when it blows against the cordage\r\nof ships, houses, trees, and generally every object with which it\r\ncomes in contact.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand,\" replied Jack, \"how this sonorous effect is\r\nproduced on the particles of air in immediate contact with the object\r\nstruck; but how this sound is propagated, I do not see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely; but still it travels from particle to particle, in a\r\ncircle, at the rate of three hundred and forty yards in a second.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred and forty yards in a second!\" said Willis, who was\r\nbeginning by degrees to recover his self-possession. \"Well, that is\r\nwhat I should call going a-head.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by what sort of compasses has this speed been measured, Master\r\nErnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first accurate measurement, Master Jack, was made at Paris in\r\n1738. There are there two tolerably elevated points, namely,\r\nMontmartre and Montlhéry--the distance between these, in a direct\r\nline, is 14,636 _toises_. Cannons were fired during the night, and the\r\nengineers on one of the elevations observed that an interval of\r\neighty-six seconds and a half elapsed between the flash and the report\r\nof a cannon fired on the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"That half-second is very amusing,\" said Jack laughing; \"if there had\r\nbeen only eighty or eighty-six net, one might still be permitted to\r\nentertain some doubts; but eighty-six and a half admits nothing of the\r\nkind. But why not three-quarters or six-eighths, they would do as\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is more natural than to reckon the fraction, if we are desirous\r\nof obtaining absolute precision? Is six months of your time of no\r\nvalue? Are thirty minutes more or less on the dial of your watch of no\r\nsignification to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother is perfectly right, Jack; you are not always successful\r\nin your jokes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Other experiments have been made since then,\" continued Ernest, \"and\r\nthe results have always been the same, making allowances for the wind,\r\nand a slight variation that is ascribed to temperature.\"\r\n\r\n\"To confirm the accuracy of this statement, the speed of light would\r\nhave to be taken into consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but the velocity of light is so great, that the instant a\r\ncannon is fired the flash is seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever the distance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, whatever the distance. Bear in mind that the rays of the sun\r\nonly require eight minutes to traverse the thirty-four millions of\r\nleagues that extend between us and that body. Hence it follows that\r\nthe time light takes to travel from one point to another on the earth\r\nmay be regarded as _nil_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is something like distance and speed,\" remarked Willis, \"and may\r\nbe all right as regards the sun, but I should not be disposed to admit\r\nthat there are any other instances of the same kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Master Willis; and yet the sun is only a step from us in\r\ncomparison to the distance of some stars that we see very distinctly,\r\nbut which are, nevertheless, so remote, that their rays, travelling at\r\nthe same rate as those of the sun, are several years in reaching us.\"\r\n\r\nWillis rose abruptly, whistling \"the Mariner's March,\" and went to\r\njoin Fritz, who was steering the pinnace.\r\n\r\nAt this _naïve_ mark of disapprobation on the part of the Pilot,\r\nBecker, Ernest, and Jack burst involuntarily into a violent peal of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh away, laugh away.\" said Willis; \"I will not admit your\r\ncalculations for all that.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky had now assumed an opal or azure tint, the wind had gradually\r\ndied away into a gentle breeze, the waves were now swelling gently and\r\nregularly, like the movements of the infant's cradle that is being\r\nrocked asleep. Never had a day, opening in the convulsions of a\r\ntempest, more suddenly lapsed into sunshine and smiles: it was like\r\nthe fairies of Perrault's Tales, who, at first wrapped in sorry rags,\r\nbegging and borne down with age, throw off their chrysalis and appear\r\nsparkling with youth, gaiety, and beauty, their wallet converted into\r\na basket of flowers, and their crutch to a magic wand.\r\n\r\n\"Father\" inquired Fritz, \"shall we go any farther?\"\r\n\r\nSince the weather had calmed down, and there was no longer any\r\nnecessity for exertion, the expedition had lost its charm for the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is useless; what say you, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the latter, taking Becker by the hand, \"in consideration of\r\nthe eight days' friendship that connects you even more intimately with\r\nCaptain Littlestone than my affection for him of twenty years'\r\nstanding, keep still a few miles to the east.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the sloop has been driven to a distance by the storm, and is\r\nreturning towards us, which is very likely, I do not see that we can\r\nbe of much use.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if dismasted and leaky?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would alter the case, only I am afraid the ladies will be uneasy\r\nabout us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they were half prepared, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack is right,\" added Fritz, whose energies were again called into\r\nplay by the thought of the _Nelson_ in distress; \"let us go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, on the word of a pilot, the sea will be very calm and gentle\r\nfor some time to come: there is not the slightest danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if there were?\" replied Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Willis, I shall give up the pinnace to you till dark,\" said\r\nBecker, \"and may God guide us; we shall return to-night, so as to\r\narrive at Rockhouse early in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for the captain!\" cried Willis, throwing a cap into the air.\r\n\r\nThe evolutions of a cap, thrown up towards the sky or down upon the\r\nground, were very usual modes with Willis of expressing his joy or\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nThis homage rendered to Becker, he hastened to let a reef out of the\r\nsheet, and the pinnace, for a moment at rest, redoubled its speed,\r\nlike post-horses starting from the inn-door under the combined\r\ninfluence of a cheer from the postillion and a flourish of the whip.\r\n\r\n\"There is a cockle-shell that skips along pretty fairly,\" said Willis;\r\n\"but it wants two very important things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What things?\"\r\n\r\n\"A caboose and a nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"A caboose and a nigger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean a pantry and a cook; a gale for breakfast is all very\r\nwell, one gets used to it, it is light and easily digested; but the\r\nsame for dinner is rather too much of a good thing in one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I observed your thoughtful mother hang a sack on one of your\r\nshoulders, which appeared tolerably well filled--where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Jack, issuing from the hatchway; \"here are our\r\nstores: a ham, two Dutch cheeses, two callabashes full of Rockhouse\r\nmalaga, and there is plenty of fresh water in the gourds; with these,\r\nwe have wherewithal to defy hunger till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said Willis.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, a cap did not appear in the air, as the last one\r\nhad not been seen since the former ovation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us lay the table,\" said Jack, arranging the coils of rope that\r\ncrowded the deck. \"Well, you see, Willis, we want for nothing on board\r\nthe pinnace, not even a what-do-you-call-it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A caboose, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not even a caboose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true; and if the _Nelson_ were in the offing, I would not\r\nexchange my pilot's badge for the epaulettes of a commodore; but,\r\nalas! she is not there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Willis, cheer up; one is either a man or one is not. What\r\nis the good of useless regrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little, but it is hard to be yard-armed while absent at my time\r\nof life--and afterwards--your health, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be hard at any age, Willis; but I rather think it has not\r\ncome to that yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it has come to it, there will be very little time left to talk\r\nit over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say, brother, that the _Nelson_ might hear our signals\r\nwithout our hearing hers? If so, there is a chance for Willis yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Jack, because she has the wind in her favor to act as a\r\nspeaking-trumpet, whilst we had it against us acting as a deafener.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any other influence that affects sound besides the wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have already mentioned that temperature has something to do\r\nwith it. Sound varies in intensity according to the state of the\r\natmosphere. If, for example, we ring a small bell in a closed vessel\r\nfilled with air, it has been observed that, as the air is withdrawn by\r\nthe pump, the sound gradually grows less and less distinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if a vacuum be formed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the sound is totally extinguished.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" objected Willis, \"if two persons were to talk in what you\r\ncall a vacuum, they would not hear each other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two persons could not talk in a vacuum,\" replied Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they would die as soon as they opened their mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that alters the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, on the contrary, a quantity of air or gas were compressed into a\r\nspace beyond what it habitually held, then the sound,\" continued\r\nErnest, \"would be more intense than if the air were free.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case a whisper would be equal to a howl!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I am joking, Willis; but on the tops of high mountains,\r\nsuch as the Himalaya and Mont Blanc, where the air is much rarified,\r\nvoices are not heard at the distance of two paces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awkward for deaf people!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whilst, on the icy plains of the frozen regions, where the air is\r\ncondensed by the severe cold, a conversation, held in the ordinary\r\ntone, may be easily carried on at the distance of half a league.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awkward for secrets!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how does sound operate with regard to solid bodies?\" inquired\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\"According to the degree of elasticity possessed by their veins or\r\nfibres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, solid bodies, whose structure is such that the vibration\r\ncommunicated to some of their atoms circulates through the mass, are\r\nsusceptible of conveying sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give us an instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apply your ear to one end of a long beam, and you will hear\r\ndistinctly the stroke of a pin's head on the other; whilst the same\r\nstroke will scarcely be heard through the breadth of the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that, in the first case, the sound runs along the longitudinal\r\nfibres where the contiguity of parts is closer, than when the body is\r\ntaken transversely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And across water?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is heard, but more feebly.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time Fritz had been closely observing with the telescope a\r\nparticular part of the horizon, when all at once he cried, \"This time\r\nI see him distinctly; he is bearing down upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? the sloop?\" cried Willis, starting up and letting fall the glass\r\nhe had in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What an extraordinary pace! he bounds into the air, then plumps into\r\nthe water, then leaps up again, just like an India-rubber ball, that\r\ntouches the ground only to take a fresh spring!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, Master Fritz; the _Nelson_ tops the waves honestly and\r\ngallantly; but as to leaping into the air, she is a little too bulky\r\nfor that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, poor Willis, it is not the _Nelson_ that is under my glass at\r\npresent, but an enormous fish, ten or twelve feet in length.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how you startled me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Father! Ernest! prepare to fire! Jack, the harpoon! he is coming this\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nFritz stood at the stern of the pinnace, his rifle levelled, following\r\nwith his eyes the movements of the monster; when within reach, he\r\nfired with so much success and address that he hit the creature on the\r\nhead. It then changed its course, leaving behind a train of blood.\r\n\r\n\"Let us after him, Willis; quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot turned the head of the pinnace, and Jack immediately threw\r\nhis harpoon.\r\n\r\n\"Struck!\" cried he joyfully.\r\n\r\nBy the hissing of the line, and then the rapid impulsion of the\r\npinnace, it was felt that the monster had more strength than the craft\r\nand its crew together.\r\n\r\nErnest and his father fired at the same time; the ball of the former\r\nwas lost in the animal's flesh, that of the latter rebounded off a\r\nhorny protuberance that armed the monster's upper lip.\r\n\r\nFritz had time to recharge his rifle; he levelled it a second time,\r\nand the ball went to join the former; but, for all that, the pinnace\r\ncontinued to cleave the water at a furious rate.\r\n\r\nBecker seized an axe and cut the rope.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father, what a pity! such a splendid capture for our museum of\r\nnatural history!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a sword-fish, children; a monster of a dangerous species, and\r\nof extreme voracity. If, by way of reciprocity, the fish have a museum\r\nat the bottom of the sea, they will have some fine specimens of the\r\nhuman race that have become the prey of this creature; and it may be\r\nthat we were on the way to join the collection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe the formidable dentilated horn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is by means of this horn or sword, from which it takes its name,\r\nthat it wages a continual war with the whale, whose only mode of\r\nescape is by flourishing its enormous tail; but the sword-fish, being\r\nvery agile, easily avoids this, bounds into the air as Fritz saw it\r\ndoing just now, then, falling down upon its huge adversary, pierces\r\nhim with its sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, talking about the whale,\" said Jack, \"all naturalists\r\nseem agreed, and we ourselves are convinced from our own observation,\r\nthat its throat is very narrow, and that it can only swallow molluscs,\r\nor very small fishes--what, in that case, becomes of the history of\r\nJonah?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is rather unfortunate,\" replied Becker, \"that the whale has been\r\nassociated with this miracle. There is now no possibility of\r\nseparating the whale from Jonah, or Jonah from the whale; yet, in the\r\nGreek translation of the Chaldean text, there is _Ketos_--in the\r\nLatin, there is _Cete_--and both these words were understood by the\r\nancients to signify a fish of enormous size, but not the whale in\r\nparticular. The shark, for example, can swallow a man, and even a\r\nhorse, without mangling it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" said Jack, \"of navigators who have landed on the back\r\nof a whale, and walked about on it, supposing it a small island.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing impossible about that,\" observed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain, that we had just now within reach a sea monster\r\nwho has carried off four leaden bullets in his body without seeming to\r\nbe in the least inconvenienced by them; on the contrary, he seemed to\r\nmove all the quicker for the dose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Life is a very different thing with those fellows than with us. The\r\ncarp is said to live two hundred years, and it is supposed that a\r\nwhale might live for ten centuries if the harpoon did not come in the\r\nway to shorten the period.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Willis, with a sigh that might have moved a train of\r\nwaggons, \"these fellows have no cares.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the ephemeride, that dies an instant after its birth, do you\r\nsuppose that it dies of grief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows, Master Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ephemeride does not die so quickly as you think,\" said Becker;\r\n\"it commences by living three years under water in the form of a\r\nmaggot. It afterwards becomes amphibious, when it has a horny\r\ncovering, on which the rudiments of wings may be observed. Then, four\r\nor five months after this first metamorphosis, generally in the month\r\nof August, it issues from its skin, almost as rapidly as we throw off\r\na jacket; attached to the rejected skin are the teeth, lips, horns,\r\nand all the apparatus that the creature required as a water insect;\r\nthen it is no sooner winged, gay, and beautiful, than, as you observe,\r\nit dies--hence it is called the day-fly, its existence being\r\nterminated by the shades of night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was certain of it,\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Certain of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That it died of grief at being on land. When one has been accustomed\r\nto the water, you see, under such circumstances life is not worth the\r\nhaving.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day-fly,\" continued Becker, \"is an epitome of those men who\r\nspend a life-time hunting after wealth and glory, and who perish\r\nthemselves at the moment they reach the pinnacle of their ambitious\r\ndesires. Whence I conclude, my dear children, that there are nothing\r\nbut beginnings and endings of unhappiness in this world, and that true\r\nfelicity is only to be hoped for in another sphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a curious series of transformations! First an aquatic insect,\r\nnext amphibious, then throwing away the organs for which it has no\r\nfurther use, and becoming provided with those suited to its new\r\nstate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear Fritz; and yet those complicated and beautiful\r\noperations of Nature have not prevented philosophers from asserting\r\nthat the world resulted from _floating atoms_, which, by force of\r\ncombination, and after an infinity of blind movements, conglomerate\r\ninto plants, animals, men, heaven, and earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only a plain sailor,\" said Willis \"yet the eye of a worm teaches\r\nme more than these philosophers seem to have imagined in their\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a system could only have originated in Bedlam or Charenton.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ernest, it is the system of Epicurus and Lucretius. Without going\r\nso far back, there are a thousand others quite as ridiculous, with\r\nwhich it is unnecessary to charge your young heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"All madmen are not in confinement, and it may be that Epicurus and\r\nLucretius had arrived at those limits of human reason, where genius\r\nbegins in some and folly in others.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not that, Fritz; but if men, says Malebranche somewhere,[A] are\r\ninterested in having the sides of an equilateral triangle unequal, and\r\nthat false geometry was as agreeable to them as false philosophy, they\r\nwould make the problems equally false in geometry as in morality, for\r\nthis simple reason, that their errors afford them gratification,\r\nwhilst truth would only hurt and annoy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" observed Willis; \"this Malebranche, as you call him, must\r\nhave been an admiral?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Willis, nothing more than a simple philosopher, but one of good\r\nfaith, like Socrates, who admitted that what he knew best was, that he\r\nknew nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had gradually disappeared in the midst of purple tinged\r\nclouds, leaving along the horizon at first a fringe of gold, then a\r\nsimple thread, and finally nothing but the reflection of his rays,\r\nsent to the earth by the layers of atmosphere,[B] like the adieu we\r\nreceive at the turning of a road from a friend who is leaving us.\r\n\r\nThere was a festival in the sky that night; the firmament brought out,\r\none by one, her circlet of diamonds, till the whole were sparkling\r\nlike a blaze of light; the pinnace also left a fiery train in her\r\nwake, caused partly by electricity and partly by the phosphorescent\r\nanimalculae that people the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Willis,\" said Becker, \"I leave it entirely to you to decide the\r\ninstant of our return.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot changed at once the course of the boat, without attempting\r\nto utter a word, so heavy was his heart at this unsuccessful\r\ntermination of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"It will be curious,\" observed Fritz, \"if we find the _Nelson_, on our\r\nreturn, snugly at anchor in Safety Bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a presentiment,\" said Jack; \"and you will see that we have\r\nbeen playing at hide-and-seek with the _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\nWillis shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Are there not a thousand accidents to cause a ship to deviate from\r\nher route?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Ernest, there are typhoons, and the waterspouts of which\r\nI spoke to you before. In such cases, ships often deviate from their\r\nroute, but generally by going to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nWillis concluded this sentence with a gesture that defies description,\r\nimplying annihilation.\r\n\r\n\"Remember Admiral Socrates, Willis,\" said Jack; \"_what I know best is,\r\nthat I know nothing_, and avow that God has other means of\r\naccomplishing his decrees besides typhoons and waterspouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"My excellent young friends, I know you want to inspire me with hope,\r\nas they give a toy to a child to keep it from crying, and I thank you\r\nfor your good intentions. Now, for three days you have, so to speak,\r\nhad no rest, and I insist on your profiting by this night to take some\r\nrepose; and you also, Mr. Becker; I am quite able to manage the\r\npinnace alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes providing you do not play us some trick, like that of this\r\nmorning, for instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"All stratagems are justifiable in war. Master Ernest had fair warning\r\nthat I had an idea to work out. Besides, a prisoner, when under\r\nhatches, has the right to escape if he can: under parole, the case is\r\nquite different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Willis, if you give me your simple promise to steer straight\r\nfor New Switzerland, and awake me in two hours to take the bearings--\"\r\n\r\n\"I give it, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Greenlanders then descended into the hold, for tropical\r\nnights are as chilly as the days are hot, and Becker, rolling himself\r\nup in a sail, lay on deck.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes they were all fast asleep, and Willis paced\r\nthe deck, his arms crossed, and mechanically gazing upon a star that\r\nwas mirrored in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Several years to come to us, and that at the rate of seventy thousand\r\nleagues a second--that is _a little_ too much.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went to the rudder, his head leaning upon his breast, and\r\nglancing now and then with distracted eye at the course of the boat,\r\nburied in a world of thought, sad and confused, doubtless beholding in\r\nsuccession visions of the _Nelson_, of Susan, and of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Search after Truth,\" book ix.\r\n\r\n[B] The twilight is entirely owing to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA LANDSCAPE--SAD HOUSES AND SMILING HOUSES--POLITENESS IN CHINA--EIGHT\r\nSOUPS AT DESSERT--WIND MERCHANTS--ANOTHER IDEA OF THE PILOT'S--SUSAN,\r\nVICE SOPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards five o'clock next morning everything about Rockhouse was\r\nbeginning to assume life and motion--within, all its inhabitants were\r\nalready astir--without, little remained of the recent storm and\r\ninundation except that refreshing coolness, which, conjointly with the\r\npurified air, infuses fresh vigor, not only into men, but also into\r\nevery living thing. The citrous, the aloes, and the Spanish jasmines\r\nperfumed the landscape. The flexible palms, the tall bananas, with\r\ntheir unbrageous canopy, the broad, pendant-leaved mangoes, and all\r\nthe rank but luxuriant vegetation that clothed the land to the water's\r\nedge, waved majestically under the gentle breeze that blew from the\r\nsea. The Jackal River unfolded its silvery band through the roses,\r\nbamboos, and cactii that lined its banks. The sun--for that luminary\r\nplays an important part in all Nature's festivals--darted its rays on\r\nthe soil still charged with vapor. Diamond drops sparkled in the cups\r\nof the flowers and on the points of the leaves. In the distance,\r\npines, cedars, and richly-laden cocoa-nut trees filled up the\r\nbackground with their dark foliage. The swans displayed their\r\nbrilliant plumage on the lake, the boughs of the trees were alive with\r\nparroquets and other winged creatures of the tropics. Add to the\r\ncharms of this scene, Mrs. Becker returning from the prairie with a\r\njar of warm, frothy milk--Mrs. Wolston and Mary busied in a\r\nmultiplicity of household occupations, to which their white hands and\r\nringing voices gave elegance and grace--Sophia tying a rose to the\r\nneck of a blue antelope which she had adopted as a companion--Frank\r\ndistributing food to the ostriches and large animals, and admit, if\r\nthere is a paradise on earth, it was this spot.\r\n\r\nCompare this scene with that presented by any of our large cities at\r\nthe same hour in the morning. In London or Paris, our dominion rarely\r\nextends over two or three dreary-looking rooms--a geranium, perhaps,\r\nat one of the windows to represent the fields and green lanes of the\r\ncountry; above, a forest of smoking chimneys vary the monotony of the\r\nzig-zag roofs; below, a thousand confused noises of waggons, cabs, and\r\nthe hoarse voices of the street criers; probably the lamps are just\r\nbeing extinguished, and the dust heaps carted away, filling our rooms,\r\nand perhaps our eyes, with ashes; the chalk-milk, the air, and the\r\nodors are scarcely required to fill up the picture.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was spread a few paces from Mr. Wolston's bed, whom the two\r\nyoung girls were tending with anxious solicitude, and whose sickness\r\nwas almost enviable, so many were the cares lavished upon him.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, Mrs. Becker,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"to make yourself\r\nuneasy, the sea has become as smooth as a mirror since their\r\ndeparture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, I know that, my dear Mrs. Wolston, but when one has already\r\nundergone the perils of shipwreck, the impression always remains, and\r\nmakes us see storms in a glass of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain,\" remarked Mr. Wolston, \"the cause of their delay is a\r\nconcession made to Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely he would not consent to return, unless they went as far\r\nas possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, madam,\" said Mary, \"now that you have got two great girls\r\nadded to your establishment, I hope you are going to make them useful\r\nin some way--we can sew, knit, and spin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And know how to make preserves,\" added Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and to eat them too,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\n\"If you can spin, my dears, we shall find plenty of work for you; we\r\nhave here the Nankin cotton plant, and I intend to dress the whole\r\ncolony with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delightful!\" exclaimed Sophia, clapping her hands; \"Nankin dresses\r\njust as at the boarding-school, with a straw hat and a green veil.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, it must be woven first,\" reflected Mrs. Becker; \"but I\r\ndare say we shall be able to manage that.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, girls,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"have you forgotten your\r\nlessons in tapestry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, mamma; and now that we think of it, we shall handsomely\r\nfurnish a drawing-room for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are the tables and chairs to come from?\" inquired Mrs.\r\nBecker.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the gentlemen will see to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the room, where is that to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the gallery, is there not?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the wool for the carpet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not sheep?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, children; you speak as if we had only to go and sit\r\ndown in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The piano, however, I fear will be wanting, unless we can pick up an\r\nErard in the neighboring forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, mamma, all the overtures that we have had so much trouble in\r\nlearning will have to go for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"by way of compensation, there is the\r\nvegetable and fruit garden, the pantry, the kitchen, the dairy, and\r\nthe poultry yard; these are all my charges, and you may have some of\r\nthem if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, each shall have her own kingdom and subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"It being understood,\" suggested Mrs. Wolston, \"that you are not to\r\neat everything up, should the fruit garden or pantry come under your\r\ncharge.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not fair, mamma; you are making us out to be a couple of\r\ncannibals.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" continued Mrs. Wolston, \"these young people have not the\r\nslightest objection to my parading their accomplishments, but the\r\nmoment I touch their faults they feel aggrieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am persuaded,\" rejoined Mrs. Becker laughing, \"that there are no\r\ncalumniators in the world like mothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, mamma, to punish you we shall come and kiss you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly Mrs. Wolston was half stifled under the embraces of\r\nher two daughters.\r\n\r\n\"I am certainly not the offender,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"but I should not\r\nobject to receive a portion of the punishment; these great\r\nboys--pointing to Frank--are too heavy to hang on my neck now; you\r\nwill replace them, my dears, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most willingly, madam; but not to deprive them of their places in\r\nyour affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"In case you should lose that, Master Frank,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"you\r\nmust have recourse to mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But now, my friends, what do you say to going down to the shore to\r\nmeet the pinnace, and perhaps the _Nelson_?\" said Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Sophia; \"and I will stay at home to wait upon father.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mary; \"I am the eldest--that is my right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my children, do not quarrel about that,\" said Wolston; \"I feel\r\nrather better; and I dare say a walk will do me good. Perhaps, when I\r\nget tired, Frank will lend me his arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than that,\" hastily added Frank; \"I shall saddle Blinky; and\r\nlead him gently, and you will be as comfortable as in an arm-chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that you call Blinky?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, one of our donkeys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, very good; I was afraid you meant one of your ostriches, and I\r\ncandidly admit that my experiences in equitation do not extend to\r\nriding a winged horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"to keep Blinky's brother from being\r\njealous, I, shall charge him with a basket of provisions; and we shall\r\nlay a cloth under the mangoes, so that our ocean knights, as Jack will\r\nhave it, may have something to refresh themselves withal as soon as\r\nthey dismount.\"\r\n\r\nThe little caravan was soon on the march; the two dogs cleared the\r\nway, leaping, bounding, and scampering on before, sniffing the bushes\r\nwith their intelligent noses; then, returning to their master, they\r\nread in his face what was next to be done. Mary walked by the side of\r\nBlinky, amusing her father with her prattle. Sophia, with her\r\nantelope, was gambolling around them, the one rivalling the other in\r\nthe grace of their movements, not only without knowing it, but rather\r\nbecause they did not know it. The two mothers were keeping an eye on\r\nthe donkey; whilst Frank, with his rifle charged, was ready to bring\r\ndown a quail or encounter a hyena.\r\n\r\nSome hours after the pinnace hove in sight, the voyagers landed, and\r\nreceived the warm congratulations of those on shore. When Willis had\r\nsecured the boat, he took a final survey of the coast, penetrating\r\nwith his eyes every creek and crevice.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no trace of the _Nelson_?\" inquired Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"None!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had all along thought you would find it so; the wind for four\r\ndays has been blowing that it would drive the _Nelson_ to her\r\ndestination. Captain Littlestone, being charged with important\r\ndespatches, having already lost a fortnight here, has, no doubt, taken\r\nadvantage of the gale, and made sail for the Cape, trusting to find us\r\nall alive here on his return voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Pilot, \"I know very well that you have all good\r\nhearts, and that you are desirous of giving me all the consolation you\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you not have acted, under similar circumstances, precisely as\r\nwe suppose Captain Littlestone to have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit that the thing, is not only possible, but also that, if\r\nalive, it is just what he would have done. I trust, if it be so, that\r\nwhen he gets into port he will report me keel-hauled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keel-hauled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean dead. It is a thousand times better to pass for a dead\r\nman than a deserter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wisest course he could pursue, it appears to me, would be to hold\r\nhis tongue--probably you will not be missed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you think that her Majesty's blue jackets can disappear in that\r\nway, like musk-rats? But no such thing. When the captain in command at\r\nthe station hails on board, every man and boy of the crew, from the\r\npowder-monkey to the first-lieutenant, are mustered in pipe-clay on\r\nthe quarter-deck, and there, with the ship's commission in his hand,\r\nevery one must report himself as he calls over the names.\r\n\r\n\"Then the captain will tell the simple truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, truth has nothing at all to do with the rules of the\r\nservice, the questions printed in the orderly-book only will be asked,\r\nand he may not have an opportunity of stating the facts of the case;\r\nbesides, discipline on board a ship in commission could not be\r\nmaintained if irregularities could be patched up by a few words from\r\nthe captain. When it is found that I had been left on shore, the\r\nquestions will be, 'Was the _Nelson_ in want of repairs?' 'No.' 'Did\r\nshe require water?' 'No.' 'Provisions?' 'No.' 'Then Willis has\r\ndeserted?' 'Yes.' And his condemnation will follow as a matter of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, the Captain would be more to blame than you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he would, and it is for that reason I hope he will be able to show\r\nby the log that I was seized with cholera, tied up in a sack, and duly\r\nthrown overboard with a four-pound shot for ballast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot conceive,\" said Becker, \"that the discipline of any service\r\ncan be so cruelly unreasonable as you would have us believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, perhaps you think that just before the anchor is heaved, and the\r\nship about to start on a long voyage, the cabin boys are asked whether\r\nthey have the colic--that lubbers, who wish to back out have only to\r\nsay the word, and they are free--that the pilot may go a-hunting if he\r\nlikes, and that the officers may stay on shore and amuse themselves in\r\ndefiance of the rules of the service? In that case the navy would be\r\nrather jolly, but not much worth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Willis was once fairly started there was no stopping him.\r\n\r\n\"Dead,\" he continued; \"that is to say, without a berth, pay, or even a\r\nname, nothing! My wife will have the right to marry again, my little\r\nSusan will have another father, and I shall only be able to breathe by\r\nstealth, and to consider that as more than I deserve. You must admit\r\nthat all this is rather a poor look-out a-head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Willis,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"you seem to take a pride in\r\nmaking things worse than they are, conjuring up phantoms that have no\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, madam. I may be going upon a wrong tack. Judging from all\r\nappearances, the sloop, instead of being on her way to the Cape, is\r\ntranquilly reposing at the bottom of the sea. But it is only death for\r\ndeath; hanged by a court-martial or drowned with the sloop, it comes,\r\nin the end, to the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say, Willis, had there really been an accident, and you had\r\nbeen on board, you would not have felt yourself entitled to escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, madam; unless the crew could be saved, it would look\r\nanything but well for the pilot to escape alone.\"\r\n\r\nWillis, however, to do him justice, seemed trying to smother his\r\ngrief; and, in the meanwhile, the two girls had been spreading a pure\r\nwhite cloth on a neighboring rock, cutting fruit plates out of the\r\nthick mangoe leaves, cooling the Rockhouse malaga in the brook, and\r\ngiving to the repast an air of elegance and refinement which had the\r\neffect of augmenting the appetite of the company. The viands were not\r\nbetter than they had been on many similar occasions, but they were now\r\nmore artistically displayed, and consequently more inviting.\r\n\r\nWho has not remarked, in passing through a street of dingy-looking\r\nhouses, one of them distinguished from the others by its fresh and\r\ncheerful aspect, the windows garnished with a luxuriant screen of\r\nflowers, with curtains on either side of snowy whiteness and elaborate\r\nworkmanship? Very likely the passer-by has asked himself, Why is this\r\nhouse not as neglected, tattered, and dirty as its wretched neighbors?\r\nThe answer is simple; there dwells in this house a young girl, blithe,\r\nfrolicsome, and joyous, singing with the lark, and, like a butterfly,\r\nfloating from her book to her work-box--from her mother's cheek to her\r\nfather's, leaving an impress of her youthfulness and purity on\r\nwhatever she touches.\r\n\r\nFor a like reason the _al fresco_ dinner of this day had a charm that\r\nno such feast had been observed to possess before.\r\n\r\n\"We are not presentable,\" said Fritz, referring to his seal-gut\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" replied Mrs. Wolston, \"it is your costume of war, brave knights;\r\nand, for my part, I admire you more in it than in the livery of Hyde\r\nPark or Bond Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Ernest, \"we shall do as they do in China.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the most profound remark of respect a host can pay to his\r\nguests, is to go and dress after dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just when they are about to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very decidedly a Chinese observance. Are they not somewhat\r\nbehind in cookery?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means, madam; on the contrary, they have attained a very high\r\ndegree of perfection in that branch of the arts. It is customary, at\r\nevery ceremonious dinner, to serve up fifty-two distinct dishes. And\r\nwhen that course is cleared off, what do you think is produced next?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dessert, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight kinds of soup, never either one more or one less. If the number\r\nwere deficient, the guests would consider themselves grossly insulted,\r\nthe number of dishes denoting the degree of respect entertained by the\r\nhost for his guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg, Mrs. Wolston,\" said Mrs. Becker laughing, \"that you will not\r\nestimate our esteem for you by the dinner we offer you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Mrs. Wolston in the same tone, \"let me see; to be\r\ntreated as we ought to be, there are fifty-seven dishes wanting,\r\ntherefore we must go and dine at home. John, call my carriage.\"\r\n\r\nAt this sally they all laughed heartily, and even Willis chimed in\r\nwith the general hilarity.\r\n\r\n\"Then, after the soups,\" continued Ernest, \"comes the tea, and with\r\nthat the dessert, as also sixty square pieces of silver paper to wipe\r\nthe mouth. It is then that the host vanishes, to reappear in a\r\nbrilliant robe of gold brocade and a vest of satin.\"\r\n\r\n\"These people ought all to perish of indigestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they are moderate eaters, their dishes consist of small saucers,\r\neach containing only a few mouthfuls of meat, and, as for Europeans,\r\nthe want of forks and spoons--\"\r\n\r\n\"What! have they no forks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at table--nor knives either; but, on the other hand, they are\r\nexceedingly expert in the use of two slender sticks of ivory, which\r\nthey hold in the first three fingers of the right hand, and with which\r\nthey manage to convey solids, and even liquids, to their mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see,\" said Jack; \"the Europeans would be obliged, like Mrs.\r\nWolston, to call their carriage, in spite of the fifty-two saucers of\r\nmeat: it puts me in mind of the stork inviting the fox to dine with\r\nher out of a long-necked jar.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are apt to judge the Chinese by the pictures seen of them on their\r\nown porcelain, and copied upon our pottery,\" said Becker; \"but this\r\nconveys only a ludicrous idea of them. They are the most industrious,\r\nbut at the same time the vainest, most stupid, and most credulous\r\npeople in the world; they worship the moon, fire, fortune, and a\r\nthousand other things; people go about amongst them selling wind,\r\nwhich they dispose of in vials of various sizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a trade that will not require an extraordinary amount of\r\ncapital.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; and besides, as they carry on their trade in the open air, they\r\nhave no rent to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their bonzes or priests,\" continued Becker, \"to excite charity,\r\nperambulate the streets in chains, sometimes with some inflammable\r\nmatter burning on their heads, whilst, instead of attempting to purify\r\nthe souls of dying sinners, they put rice and gold in their mouths\r\nwhen the vital spark has fled. They have a very cruel mode of\r\npunishing renegade Lamas: these are pierced through the neck with a\r\nred-hot iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a Lama, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a designation of the Tartar priests.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time Willis had been closely examining a particular point in\r\nthe bay with increasing anxiety; at last he ran towards the shore and\r\nleapt into the sea. Becker and his four sons were on the point of\r\nstarting off in pursuit of him.\r\n\r\n\"Stop,\" said Wolston, \"I have been watching Willis's movements for the\r\nlast ten minutes, and I guess his purpose--let him alone.\"\r\n\r\nWillis swam to some object that was floating on the water, and\r\nreturned in about a quarter of an hour, bringing with him a plank.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he inquired, on landing, \"was I wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong about what?\" inquired Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"The _Nelson_ is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The proof, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"That plank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what about the plank?\"\r\n\r\n\"I recognise it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"How! Well,\" replied the obstinate pilot, \"fish don't breed planks,\r\nand--and--I scarcely think this one could escape from a dockyard, and\r\nfloat here of its own accord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Willis, according to you, there are no ships but the _Nelson_,\r\nno ships wrecked but the _Nelson_, and no planks but the _Nelson's_.\r\nWillis, you are a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one has his own ideas, Mr. Wolston.\"\r\n\r\nTowards evening, when they were on their way back to Rockhouse, Sophia\r\nconfidentially called Willis aside, and he cheerfully obeyed the\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n\"Pilot,\" said she, \"I have made up my mind about one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that, Miss Sophia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this--in future, when we are alone, as just now, you must call\r\nme Susan, as you used to call your own little girl when at home, not\r\nMiss Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I cannot do that, Miss Sophia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I insist upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Sophia, I will try.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Sus--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Susan, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"There now, that will do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nALLOTMENT OF QUARTERS--A HORSE MARINE--TRAVELLING PLANTS--CHANGE OF\r\nDYNASTY IN ENGLAND--A WOMAN'S KINGDOM--SHEEP CONVERTED INTO\r\nCHOPS--RESURRECTION OF THE FRIED FISH--A SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some days more of anxious but fruitless expectation, it was\r\nfinally concluded that either the _Nelson_ had sailed for the Cape,\r\nor, as Willis would have it, she had gone to that unexplored and dread\r\nland where there were neither poles nor equator, and whence no mariner\r\nwas ever known to return. It was necessary, therefore, to make\r\narrangements for the surplus population of the colony--whether for a\r\ntime or for ever, it was then impossible to say. At first sight, it\r\nmight appear easy enough to provide accommodation for the eleven\r\nindividuals that constituted the colony of New Switzerland. It is true\r\nthat land might have been marked off, and each person made sovereign\r\nover a territory as large as some European kingdoms; but these\r\nsovereignties would have resembled the republic of St. Martin--there\r\nwould have been no subjects. What, then, would they have governed? it\r\nmay be asked. Themselves, might be answered; and it is said to be a\r\nfar more difficult task to govern ourselves than to rule others.\r\n\r\nThough space was ample enough as regards the colony in general, it was\r\nsomewhat limited as regards detail. To live _pêle-mêle_ in Rockhouse\r\nwas entirely out of the question. Independently of accommodation, a\r\nthousand reasons of propriety opposed such an arrangement. Whether or\r\nnot there might be another cave in the neighborhood, hollowed out by\r\nNature, was not known; if there were, it had still to be discovered.\r\nChance would not be chance, if it were undeviating and certain in its\r\noperations. To consign the Wolstons to Falcon's Nest or Prospect\r\nHill, and leave them there alone, even though under the protection of\r\nWillis, could not be thought of; they knew nothing of the dangers that\r\nwould surround them, and as yet they were ignorant of the topography\r\nof the island. It was, therefore, requisite that both families should\r\ncontinue in proximity, so as to aid each other in moments of peril,\r\nbut without, at the same time, outraging propriety, or shackling\r\nindividual freedom of action. Under ordinary circumstances, these\r\ndifficulties might have been solved by taking apartments on the\r\nopposite side of the street, or renting a house next door. But, alas!\r\nthe blessings of landlords and poor-rates had not yet been bestowed on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nOne day after dinner, when these points were under consideration,\r\nWillis, who was accustomed to disappear after each meal, no one knew\r\nwhy or whereto, came and took his place amongst them under the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\n\"As for myself,\" said the Pilot, \"I do not wish to live anywhere.\r\nSince I am in your house, Mr. Becker, and cannot get away honestly for\r\na quarter of an hour, I must of course remain; but as for becoming a\r\nmere dependant on your bounty, that I will not suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say there is not very complimentary to me,\" said Mr.\r\nWolston.\r\n\r\n\"Your position, Mr. Wolston, is a very different thing: besides, you\r\nare an invalid and require attention, whilst I am strong and healthy,\r\nfor which I ought to be thankful.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not in my house,\" replied Becker \"any more than I am in\r\nyours; the place we are in is a shelter provided by Providence for us\r\nall, and I venture to suppose that such a host is rich enough to\r\nsupply all our wants. I am only the humble instrument distributing the\r\ngifts that have been so lavishly bestowed on this island.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say is very kind and very generous,\" added Willis, \"but I\r\nmean to provide for myself--that is my idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not a bad one either,\" continued Becker; \"but how? You are\r\nwelcome here to do the work for four--if you like; and then, supposing\r\nyou eat for two, I will be your debtor, not you mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Work! and at what? walking about with a rifle on my shoulder; airing\r\nmyself, as I am doing now under your gallery, in the midst of flowers,\r\non the banks of a river: or opening my mouth for quails to jump down\r\nmy throat ready roasted--would you call that work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look there, Willis--what do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bear-skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose, by way of a beginning, I were to introduce you to a\r\nfine live bear, with claws and tusks to match, ready to spring on you,\r\nhaving as much right to your skin as you have to his--now, were I to\r\nsay to you, I want that animal's skin, to make a soft couch similar to\r\nthe one you see yonder, would you call that work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, then; it is in the midst of such labors that we pass our\r\nlives. Before we fell comfortably asleep on feather beds, those\r\nformidable bones which you see in our museum were flying in the air;\r\nthe cup which I now hold in my hand was a portion of the clay on which\r\nyou sit; the canoe with which you ran away the other day was a live\r\nseal; the hats that we wear, were running about the fields in the form\r\nof angola rabbits. So with everything you see about you; for fifteen\r\nyears, excepting the Sabbath, which is our day of rest and recreation\r\nas well as prayer, we have never relapsed from labor, and you are at\r\nliberty to adopt a similar course, if you feel so disposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No want of variety,\" said Jack; \"if you do not like the saw-pit, you\r\ncan have the tannery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither are very much in my line,\" replied Willis.\r\n\r\n\"What then do you say to pottery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have broken a good deal in my day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but there is a difference between breaking it and making it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What appears most needful,\" remarked Fritz, \"is, three or four acres\r\nof fresh land, to double our agricultural produce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is land dear in these parts?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"It is not to be had for nothing, madam; there is the trouble of\r\nselecting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the labor of rendering it productive,\" added Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"But how do you manage for a lawyer to convey it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was advising Ernest to adopt that profession,\" said Mrs. Becker;\r\n\"wills and contracts would be in harmony with his studious\r\ntemperament.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present, the question before us,\" said Becker, \"is the allotment\r\nof quarters; in the meantime, Mr. and Mrs. Wolston, with the young\r\nladies, will continue to occupy our room.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Wolston \"that would be downright expropriation.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case the matter comes within the sphere of our lawyer, and I\r\ntherefore request his advice.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Ernest replied, by slowly examining his pockets; after this\r\noperation was deliberately performed, he said, in a _nisi prius_ tone,\r\n\"That he had forgotten his spectacles, and consequently that it was\r\nimpossible for him to look into the case in the way its importance\r\ndemanded, otherwise he was quite of the same opinion as his learned\r\nbrother--his father, he meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if we refuse?\" said Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"If you refuse, Mrs. Wolston, there is only one other course to\r\nadopt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that, Master Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, simply this,\" and rising, he cried out lustily, \"John, call Mrs.\r\nWolston's carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, to such an argument as that, there can be no reply; so I see you\r\nmust be permitted to do what you like with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" continued Becker; \"then there is one point decided: my\r\nwife and I will occupy the children's apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the children,\" said Jack, \"will occupy the open air. For my own\r\npart, I have no objection: that is a bedroom exactly to my taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spacious,\" remarked Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"Well-aired,\" suggested Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Hangings of blue, inlaid with stars of gold,\" observed Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Any thing else?\" inquired Becker.\r\n\r\n\"No, father, I believe the extent of accommodation does not go beyond\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I have decided upon something less vast, but more\r\ncomfortable for you; you will go every night to our _villa_ of\r\nFalcon's Nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"On foot?\"\r\n\r\n\"On horseback, if you like and under the direction of Willis, whom I\r\nname commander-in-chief of the cavalry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the cavalry!\" cried the sailor; \"what! a pilot on horseback?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be uneasy, Willis,\" replied Jack, \"we have no horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, that alters the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then we have zebras and ostriches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ostriches! worse and worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say not so, good Willis; when once you have tried Lightfoot or\r\nFlyaway, you would never wish to travel otherwise: they run so fast\r\nthat the wind is fairly distanced, and scarcely give us time to\r\nbreathe--it is delightful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, but I would rather try and get the canoe to travel on\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Willis,\" said Fritz, \"that would be an achievement that would do\r\nyou infinite credit--if you only succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to make a request, Mrs. Becker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to Willis,\" said Jack, \"he has an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The request I have to urge is, that you will permit me to encamp on\r\nShark's Island, and there establish a lighthouse for the guidance of\r\nthe _Nelson_, in case she should return.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the commander-in-chief of cavalry on an island?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not of the cavalry, but of the fleet; it is only necessary for\r\nMr. Becker to change my position into that of an admiral, which will\r\nnot give him much extra trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do so with pleasure, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, since I am an admiral, the first thing I shall do, is\r\nto pardon myself for the faults I committed whilst I was a pilot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said Ernest, \"that puts me in mind of Louis XII., who, on\r\nascending the throne, said that it was not for the King of France to\r\nrevenge the wrongs of the Duke of Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is to become of the boys? I intended to make you their\r\ncompass--on land, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boys,\" cried the latter, \"are willing to enlist as seamen, and\r\naccompany the admiral on his cruise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will spin yarns for us, Willis, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lads, if you want a sleeping dose, I will undertake to do\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are objections to this arrangement,\" Mrs. Becker hastily\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\"What are they, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, a storm might arise some fine night--one of those\r\ndreadful hurricanes that continue several days, like the one that\r\nterrified us so much lately--and then all communication would be cut\r\noff between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could always see one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"From a distance--with the telescope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Mrs. Becker, \"you would be a prey to famine, for\r\nthough the telescope, good Master Willis, might enable you to see our\r\ndinner--from a distance--I doubt whether that would prevent you dying\r\nof starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might easily guard against that, by taking over a sufficient\r\nquantity of provisions with us every night, and bringing them back\r\nnext morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could you carry over my kisses, Willis, and distribute them\r\namongst my children every morning and evening, like rations of rice?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the arrangement will really make you uneasy, Mrs. Becker, I give\r\nit up,\" said Willis, polishing with his arm the surface of his\r\noil-skin sou'-wester.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Willis. It is for me to give up my objections. Besides, I\r\nobserve Miss Sophia staring at me with her great eyes; she will never\r\nforgive me for tormenting her sweetheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! since I have been staring at you, I have only now to eat you up\r\nlike the wolf in Little Red Ridinghood,\" and in a moment her slender\r\narms were clasped round Mrs. Becker's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Becker, \"there is another point settled--temporarily.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Europe,\" observed Wolston, \"there is nothing so durable as the\r\ntemporary.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Europe, yes, but not here. To-morrow morning we shall select a\r\ntree near Falcon's Nest, and in eight days you shall be permanently\r\nhoused in an aerial tenement close to ours, so that we may chat to\r\neach other from our respective balconies.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be a castle in the air a little more real than those I have\r\nbuilt in Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have been in Spain, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one has been less or more in the Spain I refer to. Sophy--it is\r\nthe land of dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of castanets,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Then my sweetheart will be alone on his island, like an exile?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss Sophia, we are incapable of such ingratitude. After enjoying\r\nthe hospitality of Willis in Shark's Island, he will surely deign to\r\naccept ours at Falcon's Nest; so, whether here or there, he shall\r\nalways have four devoted followers to keep him company.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot shook Fritz by the hand, at the same time nearly dislocating\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why God, who is so good, has not made houses grow of\r\nthemselves, like pumpkins and melons?\" said Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"Rather a lazy idea that,\" said his father; \"our great Parent has\r\nclearly designed that we should do something for ourselves; he has\r\ngiven us the acorn whence we may obtain the oak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, there are uninhabited countries which are gorged with\r\nvegetation--the territory we are in, for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but still no plant has ever sprung up anywhere without a seed\r\nhas been planted, either by the will of God or by the hands of man.\r\nWith regard, however, to the distribution of vegetation in a natural\r\nstate, that depends more upon the soil and climate than anything else;\r\nwherever there is a fertile soil and moist air, there seeds will find\r\ntheir way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"The seeds of a great many plants are furnished with downy filaments,\r\nwhich act as wings; these are taken up by the wind and carried immense\r\ndistances; others are inclosed in an elastic shell, from which, when\r\nripe, they are ejected with considerable force.\"\r\n\r\n\"The propagation of plants that have wings or elastic shells may, in\r\nthat way, be accounted for; but there are some seeds that fall, by\r\ntheir own weight, exactly at the foot of the vegetable kingdom that\r\nproduces them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is often these that make the longest voyages.\"\r\n\r\n\"By what conveyance, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my son, for a philosopher, I cannot say that your knowledge is\r\nvery profound; seeds that have no wings borrow them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from the ant, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly; but from the quail, the woodcock, the swallow, and a\r\nthousand others, that are apparently more generous than the poor ant,\r\nto which Æsop has given a reputation for avarice that it will have\r\nsome trouble to shake off. The birds swallow the seeds, many of which\r\nare covered with a hard, horny skin, that often resists digestion;\r\nthese are carried by the inhabitants of the air across rivers, seas,\r\nand lakes, and are deposited by them in the neighborhood of their\r\nnests--it may be on the top of a mountain, or in the crevice of a\r\nrock.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I never thought of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are a great many philosophers who know more about the motions\r\nof stars than these humbler operations of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are caught there,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"There are philosophers, too, who can do nothing but ridicule the\r\nknowledge of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Caught you there,\" retaliated Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"It was in this way that a bird of the Moluccas has restored the clove\r\ntree to the islands of this archipelago, in spite of the Dutch, who\r\ndestroyed them everywhere, in order that they might enjoy the monopoly\r\nof the trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I must fall back upon my original idea; by sowing a brick, we\r\nought to reap a wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if a wall, a house,\" suggested another of the young men.\r\n\r\n\"Or if a turret, a castle,\" proposed a third.\r\n\r\n\"Or a hall to produce a palace,\" remarked the fourth.\r\n\r\n\"There are four wishes worthy of the four heads that produced them!\r\nWhat do you think of those four great boys, Mrs. Wolston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam, as they are wishing, at any rate they may as well wish\r\nthat chinchillas and marmots wore their fur in the form of boas and\r\nmuffs, that turkeys produced perigord pies, and that the fish were\r\ndrawn out of the sea ready roasted or boiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or that the sheep walked about in the form of nicely grilled chops,\"\r\nsuggested Becker.\r\n\r\n\"And you, young ladies, what would you wish?\"\r\n\r\nMary, who was now beyond the age of dolls, and was fast approaching\r\nthe period of young womanhood, felt that it was a duty incumbent upon\r\nher to be more reserved than her sister, and rarely took part in the\r\nconversation, unless she was directly addressed, ceased plying her\r\nneedle, and replied, smiling,\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could make some potent elixir in the same way as gooseberry\r\nwine, that would restore sick people to health, then I would give a\r\nfew drops to my father, and make him strong and well, as he used to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the intention, my dear child.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Miss Sophia? It is your turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that all the little children were collected together, and that\r\nevery papa and mamma could pick out their own from amongst them.\"\r\n\r\nHere Willis took out his pocket-handkerchief and appeared to be\r\nblowing his nose, it being an idea of his that a sailor ought not to\r\nbe caught with a tear in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Willis, we must have a wish from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish three things: that there had not been a hurricane lately, that\r\ncanoes could be converted into three masters, and that Miss Sophia may\r\nbe Queen of England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\nAnd laying hold of a wreath of violets that the young girl had been\r\nbraiding, he solemnly placed it on her head.\r\n\r\n\"You will make her too vain,\" said Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Ah mamma, do not scold,\" and gracefully taking the crown from her own\r\nfair curls, she placed it on the silvery locks of her mother; \"I\r\nabdicate in your favor, and, sweetheart, I thank you for placing our\r\ndynasty on the throne. Mary, you are a princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"and here is my sceptre,\" holding up her spindle.\r\n\r\n\"Well answered, my daughter, that is a woman's best sceptre, and her\r\nkingdom is her house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our conversation,\" said Becker, \"is like those small threads of water\r\nwhich, flowing humbly from the hollow of a rock, swell into brooks,\r\nthen become rivers, and, finally, lose themselves in the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Ernest that led us on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is time now to get back to your starting-point again. God\r\nhas said that we shall earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, and\r\nconsequently that our enjoyments should be the result of our own\r\nindustry; that is the reason that venison is given to us in the form\r\nof the swift stag, and palaces in the form of clay; man is endowed\r\nwith reason, and may, by labor, convert all these blessings to his\r\nuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your notion,\" said Mr. Wolston, \"of drawing the fish out of the sea\r\nready cooked, puts me in mind of an incident of college life which,\r\nwith your permission, I will relate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, papa, a story!\"\r\n\r\n\"There was at Cambridge, when I was there, a young man, who, instead\r\nof study and sleep, spent his days and nights in pistol practice and\r\nplaying on the French horn, much to the annoyance of an elderly maiden\r\nlady, who occupied the apartments that were immediately under his\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are inconveniences that need not be dreaded here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our police are too strict.\"\r\n\r\n\"And our young men too well-bred,\" added Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Not only that,\" continued Mr. Wolston, \"this young student, who never\r\nthought of study, had a huge, shaggy Newfoundland dog, and the old\r\nlady possessed a chubby little pug, which she was intensely fond of;\r\nnow, when these two brutes happened to meet on the stairs, the large\r\none, by some accident or other, invariably sent the little one rolling\r\nhead over heels to the bottom; and, much to the horror of the old\r\nlady, her favorite, that commenced its journey down stairs with four\r\nlegs, had sometimes to make its way up again with three.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always understood that dogs were generous animals, and would not\r\ntake advantage of an animal weaker than themselves; our dogs would not\r\nhave acted so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps the dog was not quite so much to blame in these affairs\r\nas its master; besides, in making advances to its little friend, it\r\nmight not have calculated its own force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and perhaps might have been sorry afterwards for the mischief it\r\nhad done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely; still the point was never clearly explained, and,\r\nwhether or no, the elderly lady could not put up with this sort of\r\nthing any longer; she complained so often and so vigorously, that her\r\ntroublesome neighbor was served in due form with a notice to quit. The\r\nyoung scapegrace was determined to be revenged in some way on the\r\nparty who was the cause of his being so summarily ejected from his\r\nquarters. Now, right under his window there was a globe belonging to\r\nthe old lady, well filled with good-sized gold fish. His eye by chance\r\nhaving fallen upon this, and spying at the same time his fishing-rod\r\nin a corner, the coincidence of vision was fatal to the gold-fish;\r\nthey were very soon hooked up, rolled in flour, fried, and gently let\r\ndown again one by one into the globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to have seen the old lady when she first became aware\r\nof this transformation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, one of the fish had escaped, and was floating about, evidently\r\nlamenting the fate of its finny companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very cruel,\" observed Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Elderly ladies who have no family and live alone are very apt to\r\nbestow upon animals the love and affection that is inherent in us\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is very much to be deprecated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, Master Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not always plenty of poor and helpless human beings upon\r\nwhom to bestow their love? are there not orphans and homeless\r\ncreatures whom they might adopt?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are; but it requires wealth for such benevolences, and the\r\ngoddess Fortune is very capricious; whilst one must be very poor\r\nindeed that cannot spare a few crumbs of bread once a day. Besides,\r\nadmitting that this mania is blamable when carried to excess, still it\r\nmust be respected, for it behoves us to reverence age even in its\r\nfoibles.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, whose nature was so very susceptible, that a single grain of\r\ngood seed soon ripened into a complete virtue, bent his head in token\r\nof acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\"Now the old lady loved these gold-fish as the apples of her eyes, and\r\nher astonishment and grief, in beholding the state they were in, was\r\nindescribable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it was a loss that might have been easily repaired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you think so, Jack, do you? If you were to lose Knips, would the\r\nfirst monkey that came in your way replace him in your affections?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a very different thing--I brought Knips up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it is precisely the same thing. She had the fish when they were\r\nvery small, had seen them grow, spoke to them, gave each of them a\r\nname, and believed them to be endowed with a supernatural\r\nintelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, I contend the student was a savage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not he, my friend, he was one of the best-hearted fellows in the\r\nworld: hasty, ardent, inconsiderate, he resisted commands and threats,\r\nbut yielded readily to a tear or a prayer. As soon as he saw the\r\nsorrowful look of the old woman, he regretted what he had done, and\r\nundertook to restore the inhabitants of the globe to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"With what sort of magic wand did he propose to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the inhabitants of the house had collected round the old lady and\r\nher globe, endeavoring to console her, and at the same time trying to\r\naccount for the phenomenon; some ascribed the transformation to\r\nlightning, others went so far as to suggest witchcraft. Our scapegrace\r\nnow joined the throng, took the globe in his hands, gravely examined\r\nhis victims, and declared, with the utmost coolness that they were not\r\ndead. 'Not dead, sir! are you sure?' 'Confident, madam; it is only a\r\nlethargy, a kind of coma or temporary transformation, that will be\r\ngradually shaken off; I have seen many cases of the same kind, and, if\r\nproper care be taken as to air, repose, and diet, particularly as\r\nregards the latter, your fish will be quite well again to-morrow.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she believe that?\"\r\n\r\n\"One readily believes what one wishes to be true; besides, in\r\ntwenty-four hours, all doubt on the subject would be at an end; added\r\nto which, the young man was ostensibly a student of medicine, and had\r\nthe credit in the house of having cured the washerwoman's canary of a\r\nsore throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did he manage about the fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very simply; he went and bought some exactly the same size that were\r\nnot in a lethargy; he then, at the risk of breaking his neck or being\r\ntaken for a burglar, scaled the balcony, and substituted them for the\r\ndefunct. Next morning, when he called to inquire after his patients,\r\nhe found the old lady quite joyful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had she no doubts as to their identity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, one was a little paler and another was a trifle thinner, but\r\nshe was easily persuaded that this difference might arise from their\r\nconvalescence. The young man immediately became a great favorite; and\r\nthe old lady would rather have shared her own apartments with him,\r\nthan allow him to quit the house; he consequently remained.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, became of the pistols and the French horn?\" inquired\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\"From that time on there sprung up a close friendship between the two;\r\nhe was induced by her to convert his weapons of war into\r\npharmacopoeas. Always, when she made some nice compound of jelly and\r\ncream, he had a share of it; he, on his side, scarcely ever passed her\r\ndoor without softening his tread; and both himself and his dog\r\nmanaged, eventually, to acquire the favor of the old lady's pug.\"\r\n\r\n\"He appears to have been one of those medical gentlemen WHO profess to\r\ncure every conceivable disease by one kind of medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who generally contrive to remove both the disease and the patient\r\nat the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake the individual altogether; he is now one of the most\r\nesteemed physicians in London, remarkable alike for his skill and\r\nbenevolence. It is even strongly suspected by his friends that he is\r\nnot a little indebted for his present eminent position to his first\r\npatients--the canary and the gold-fish.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now the usual hour for retiring to rest. After the evening\r\nprayer, which Mary and Sophia said alternately aloud, Willis and the\r\nfour brothers prepared to start for Shark's Island, to pass their\r\nfirst night in the store-room and cattle-shed that had been erected\r\nthere. Of course they could not expect to be so comfortable in such\r\nquarters as at Rockhouse or Falcon's Nest; but then novelty is to\r\nyoung people what ease is to the aged. Black bread appears delicious\r\nto those who habitually eat white; and we ourselves have seen\r\nhigh-bred ladies delighted when they found themselves compelled to\r\ndine in a wretched hovel of the Tyrol--true, they were certain of a\r\nluxurious supper at Inspruck. So grief breaks the monotony of joy,\r\njust as a rock gives repose to level plain.\r\n\r\nWhilst the pinnace was gradually leaving the shore, loaded with\r\nmattresses and other movables adapted for a temporary encampment,\r\nJack signalled a parting adieu to Sophia, and, putting his fingers to\r\nhis lips, seemed to enjoin silence.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Master Jack,\" cried she.\r\n\r\n\"What is all this signalling about?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"A secret,\" said the young girl, leaping with joy; \"I have a secret!\"\r\n\r\n\"And with a young man? that is very naughty, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mamma, you will know it to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if I wanted to know it to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, mamma, if you insisted--that is--absolutely--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, child, I shall wait till to-morrow; keep it till then--if you\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sophia dear,\" said Mary to her sister, when their two heads,\r\nenveloped in snowy caps with an embroidered fringe, were reclining\r\ntogether on the same pillow, \"you know I have always shared my\r\n_bon-bons_ with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, make me a partner in your secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you promise not to speak of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even to the paroquette Fritz gave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not even to my paroquette.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is very likely I shall speak about it in my dreams--you\r\nlisten and find it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slyboots!\"\r\n\r\n\"Curiosity!\"\r\n\r\nLike those delicate flowers that shrink when they are touched, each\r\nthen turned to her own side; but it would have cost both too much not\r\nto have fallen asleep as usual, with their arms round each other's\r\nnecks;--consequently this tiff soon blew over, and, after a prolonged\r\nchat, their lips finally joined in the concluding \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN'S DOLL--ROCKHOUSE TO FALCON'S NEST--THE\r\nWIND--GLASSES--ADMIRAL HOMER--THE THREE FROGS--OAT JELLY--ESQUIMAUX\r\nASTRONOMY--AN UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, Sophia came running in with a sealed letter in her hand,\r\nwhich she opened and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"HEAD QUARTERS, SAFETY BAY, DAYBREAK.\r\n\r\n    \"The Admiral commanding the Fleet stationed in Safety Bay to her\r\n    Most gracious Majesty Sophia, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n    \"May it please your Majesty,\r\n\r\n    \"The crews of your Majesty's yachts, the _Elizabeth_ and the\r\n    _Morse_, are quite entire and in perfect health. The enemy having\r\n    kept at a respectful distance, we have not had as yet an\r\n    opportunity of proving our courage and devotion. Mr. Midshipman\r\n    Jack fell asleep on the carriage of a four-pounder, like Marshal\r\n    Turenne before his first battle; but, in all other respects, the\r\n    conduct of the officers has been most exemplary, and merits the\r\n    utmost commendation.\r\n\r\n    \"It is the admiral's intention to push out a reconnaissance\r\n    towards the east, in the direction of Pearl Bay, which he has not\r\n    yet explored. If, however, your Majesty should regard this\r\n    expedition as likely to interfere with the good understanding that\r\n    subsists between that government and your own, it will be only\r\n    necessary to fire a gun, in which case we shall return to port.\r\n    Under other circumstances, the squadron will proceed with the\r\n    enterprise, and endeavor to obtain a collar for your Majesty's\r\n    doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my doll!\" exclaimed Sophia angrily; \"when did Jack find out that\r\nI had a doll?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that, then, your secret?\" inquired her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mamma, Master Jack took a pigeon with him for the express\r\npurpose of playing me this trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is worse, included yourself in the conspiracy. Dreadful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not--to speak of a young person of thirteen's doll?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say nearer fourteen, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, to punish your confederates, I shall fire a gun, and put a\r\nstop to their excursion,\" said Becker, turning to one of the\r\nsix-pounders that flanked Rockhouse in the direction of the river.\r\n\r\n\"Clemency being one of the dearest rights of the royal prerogative,\"\r\nreplied Sophia, \"I shall pardon them, and I pray you not; to throw any\r\nobstacle in the way of their expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, your Majesty; but there are state reasons which should be\r\nallowed to overrule the impulses of your heart; those gentlemen have\r\nforgotten that we were to go and lay the first stone, or rather to\r\ncut, to-day, the first branch of your aerial residence at Falcon's\r\nNest.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Willis and his officers having obeyed the preconcerted signal,\r\nthe whole party started on their land enterprise. One of the young men\r\nwas harnessed to a sledge, containing saws, hatchets, a bamboo ladder\r\nthat had formerly done duty as a staircase to the Nest, and everything\r\nelse requisite for the contemplated project.\r\n\r\nJack had already started when Sophia called him back, and he hastily\r\nobeyed the summons.\r\n\r\n\"What are your Majesty's commands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing particular, only should you meet my doll in company with\r\nyour go-cart, be pleased to pay my respects to them.\" Saying this, she\r\nmade a low curtsy, and turned her back upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty's behests shall be obeyed,\" said Jack, and he ran off to\r\nrejoin the caravan.\r\n\r\nThe sad ravages of the tempest presented themselves as they proceeded;\r\ntall chestnuts lay stretched on the ground, and seemed, by their\r\nappearance, to have struggled hard with the storm.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" inquired Frank, \"what is the wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wind is nothing more than air rushing in masses from one point to\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what causes this commotion in the elements?\"\r\n\r\n\"The equilibrium of the atmosphere is disturbed by a variety of\r\nactions;--the diurnal motion of the sun, whose rays penetrate the air\r\nat various points; absorption and radiation, which varies according to\r\nthe nature of the soil and the hour of the day; the inequality of the\r\nsolar heat, according to seasons and latitude; the formation and\r\ncondensation of vapor, that absorbs caloric in its formation, and\r\ndisengages it when being resolved into liquid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought,\" remarked Willis, \"that there were so many mysteries\r\nin a sou'-easter. Does it blow? is it on the starboard or larboard?\r\nwas all, in fact, that I cared about knowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a word, the various circumstances that change the actual density\r\nof the air, making it more rarefied at one point than another, produce\r\ncurrents, the force and direction of which depend upon the relative\r\nposition of hot and cold atmospheric beds. Again, the winds acquire\r\nthe temperature and characteristics of the regions they traverse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" observed Frank, \"is like human beings; you may generally\r\njudge, by the language and manners of a man, the places that he is\r\naccustomed to frequent.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are hot and cold winds, wet and dry; then there are the trade\r\nwinds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" cried Willis, \"these are the winds to talk of, especially\r\nwhen sailing with them--that is, from east to west; but when your\r\ncourse is different, they are rather awkward affairs to get ahead of.\r\nThe way to catch them is to sail from Peru to the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or from Mexico to China.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, either will do; then there is no necessity for tacking, you have\r\nonly to rig your sails and smoke your pipe, or go to sleep; you may,\r\nin that way, run four thousand leagues in three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stiff sailing that, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Ernest, but it does not come up to your yarn about the\r\nstars, you recollect, ever so many millions of miles in a second!\"\r\n\r\n\"The trade winds, I was going to observe,\" continued Becker, \"that\r\nblow from the west coast of Africa, carry with them a stifling heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might be expected,\" remarked Frank, \"since they pass over the\r\nhot sands of the desert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, can you tell me why the same wind is cooler on the east coast\r\nof America?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it has been refreshed on crossing the ocean that separates\r\nthe two continents?\"\r\n\r\n\"By taking a glass of grog on the way,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and so in Europe the north wind is cold because it carries, or\r\nrather consists of, air from the polar regions; and the same effect is\r\nproduced by the south wind in the other hemisphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is for a like reason,\" suggested Ernest, \"that the south wind in\r\nEurope, and particularly the south-west wind, is humid, and generally\r\nbrings rain, because it is charged with vapor from the Atlantic\r\nOcean.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, father, that the almanac makers can predict changes in the\r\nweather?\"\r\n\r\n\"The almanac makers can only foresee one thing with absolute\r\ncertainty, and that is, that there are always fools to believe what\r\nthey say. A few meteorological phenomena may be predicted with\r\ntolerable accuracy; but these are few in number, and range within very\r\nnarrow limits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their predictions, nevertheless, sometimes turn out correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when they predict by chance a hard frost on a particular day in\r\nJanuary, it is just possible the prediction may be verified; out of a\r\nmultitude of such prognostications a few may be successful, but the\r\ngreater part of them fail. Their few successes, however, have the\r\neffect with weak minds of inspiring confidence, in defiance of the\r\nfailures which they do not take the trouble to observe.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what rate does the wind travel?\"\r\n\r\n\"The speed of the wind is very variable; when it is scarcely felt, the\r\nvelocity does not exceed a foot a second; but it is far otherwise in\r\nthe cases of hurricanes and tornados, that sweep away trees and\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\"And sink his Majesty's ships,\" observed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"In those cases the wind sometimes reaches the velocity of forty-five\r\nyards in a second, or about forty leagues in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" remarked Jack, \"the wind is a blessing that could very\r\nwell be dispensed with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your conclusions, Jack, do not always do credit to your\r\nunderstanding. The wind re-establishes the equilibrium of the\r\ntemperature, and purifies the air by dispersing in the mass\r\nexhalations that would be pernicious if they remained in one spot; it\r\nclears away miasma, it dissipates the smoke of towns, it waters some\r\ncountries by driving clouds to them, it condenses vapor on the frozen\r\nsummits of mountains, and converts it into rivers that cover the land\r\nwith fruitfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It likewise fills the sails of ships and creates pilots,\" observed\r\nWillis.\r\n\r\n\"And brings about shipwrecks,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It conveys the pollen of flowers, and, as I had occasion to state the\r\nother day, sows the seeds of Nature's fields and forests. It is\r\nlikewise made available by man in some classes of manufactures--mills,\r\nfor example.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it causes the simoon,\" persisted Jack, \"that lifts the sand of\r\nthe desert and overwhelms entire caravans; how can you justify such\r\nravages?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to plead the cause of either hurricanes or simoons;\r\nbut I contend that, if the wind sometimes terrifies us by disasters,\r\nwe have, on the other hand, to be grateful for the infinite good it\r\ndoes. In it, as in all other phenomena of the elements, the evils are\r\nrare and special, whilst the good is universal and constant.\"\r\n\r\nFritz, as usual, with the dogs and his rifle charged, acted as pioneer\r\nfor the caravan, now and then bringing down a bird, sometimes adding a\r\nplant to their collection, and occasionally giving them some\r\ninformation as to the state of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said he, \"I chased this quail into our corn-field; the grain\r\nis lying on the ground as if it had been passed over by a roller, but\r\nI am happy to say that it is neither broken nor uprooted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jack, do you see how gallantly the wind behaves, prostrating the\r\nstrong and sparing the weak? If you had been charged with the safety\r\nof the grain, no doubt you would have placed it in the tops of the\r\nhighest trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely; and, until taught by experience, everybody else would\r\nhave done precisely the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; therefore in this, as in all other things, we should admire the\r\nwisdom of Providence, and mistrust our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever would have thought of trusting the staff of human life to\r\nsuch slender support as stalks of straw?\"\r\n\r\n\"If grain had been produced by forests, these, when destroyed by war,\r\nburned down by imprudence, uprooted by hurricanes, or washed away by\r\ninundations, we should have required ages to replace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fruits of trees are, besides, more liable to rot than those of\r\ngrain; the latter have their flowers in the form of spikes, often\r\nbearded with prickly fibres, which not only protect them from\r\nmarauders, but likewise serve as little roofs to shelter them from the\r\nrain; and besides, as Fritz has just told us, owing to the pliancy of\r\ntheir stalks, strengthened at intervals by hard knots and the\r\nspear-shaped form of their leaves, these plants escape the fury of the\r\nwinds.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Willis, \"is like a wretched cock-boat, which often\r\ncontrives to get out of a scrape when all the others are swamped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" continued Becker, \"their weakness is of more service to\r\nthem than the strength of the noblest trees, and they are spread and\r\nmultiplied by the same tempests that devastate the forests. Added to\r\nthis, the species to which this class of plants belong--the\r\ngrasses--are remarkably varied in their characteristics, and better\r\nsuited than any other for universal propagation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which was remarked by Homer,\" observed Ernest \"who usually\r\ndistinguishes a country by its peculiar fruit, but speaks of the\r\nearth generally as _zeidoros_, or grain-bearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Willis,\" exclaimed Jack, \"is another great admiral for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"An admiral, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was he who led the combined fleets of Agamemnon, Diomedes, and\r\nothers, to the city of Troy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in our time, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case it was before you entered the navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that there is a Troy in the United States, but I did not know\r\nit was a sea-port.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another in France, Willis; but the Troy I mean is, or rather\r\nwas, in Asia Minor, capital of Lesser Phrygia, sometimes called Ilion,\r\nits citadel bearing the name of Pergamos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of it,\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"To return to grain,\" continued Becker, laughing. \"Nature has rendered\r\nit capable of growing in all climates, from the line to the pole.\r\nThere is a variety for the humid soils of hot countries, as the rice\r\nof Asia; immense quantities of which are produced in the basin of the\r\nGanges. There is another variety for marshy and cold climates--as a\r\nkind of oat that grows wild on the banks of the North American lakes,\r\nand of which the natives gather abundant harvests.\"\r\n\r\n\"God has amply provided for us all,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Other varieties grow best in hot, dry soils, as the millet in Africa,\r\nand maize or Indian corn in Brazil. In Europe, wheat is cultivated\r\nuniversally, but prefers rich lands, whilst rye takes more readily to\r\na sandy soil; buckwheat is most luxuriant where most exposed to rain;\r\noats prefer humid soils, and barley comes to perfection on rocky,\r\nexposed lands, growing well on the cold, bleak plains of the north.\r\nAnd, observe, that the grasses suffice for all the wants of man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed Ernest, \"with the straw are fed his sheep, his cows,\r\nhis oxen, and his horses; with the seeds, he prepares his food and\r\nhis drinks. In the north, grain is converted into excellent beer and\r\nale, and spirits are extracted from it as strong as brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese obtain from rice a liquor that they prefer to the finest\r\nwines of Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because they have not yet tasted our Rockhouse malaga.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then of roasted oats, perfumed with vanilla, an excellent jelly may\r\nbe made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! we must get mamma to try that--it will delight the young ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, no doubt, you will profit by the occasion to partake thereof\r\nyourself, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; but I would not, for all that, seek to gratify my own\r\nappetite under pretence of paying a compliment to our friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know an animal,\" said Willis, \"that, for general usefulness, beats\r\ngrain all to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! let us hear what it is, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the seal of the Esquimaux; they live upon its flesh, and they\r\ndrink its blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely think,\" said Jack, \"that I should often feel thirsty under\r\nsuch circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"The skin furnishes them with clothes, tents, and boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of which our canoe and life-preservers are a fair sample,\" said\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\n\"The fat furnishes them with fire and candle, the muscles with thread\r\nand rope, the gut with windows and curtains, the bones with arrow\r\nheads and harness; in short, with everything they require.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Willis, in so far as regards their degree of civilization,\r\nwhich is not very great, when we consider that they bury their sick\r\nwhilst alive, because they are afraid of corpses; that they believe\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars to be dead Esquimaux, who have been\r\ntranslated from earth to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst chatting in this way, the party had imperceptibly arrived at\r\nFalcon's Nest, wherein they had not set foot for a fortnight\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nFritz went up first, and before the others had ascended, came running\r\ndown again as fast as his legs would carry him.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" he cried, in an accent of alarm, \"there is a fresh litter of\r\nleaves up stairs, which has been recently slept upon, and I miss a\r\nknife that I left the last time we were here!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH FOR THE UNKNOWN--THREE FLEETS ON DRY LAND--THE\r\nINDISCRETIONS OF A SUGAR CANE--LARBOARD AND STARBOARD--THE SUPPOSED\r\nSENSIBILITY OF PLANTS--THE FLY-TRAP--VENDETTA--ROOT AND GERM--MINE AND\r\nCOUNTERMINE--THE POLYPI--OVIPAROUS AND VIVIPAROUS--A QUID PRO QUO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have any of you been at Falcon's Nest lately?\" inquired Becker, when\r\nhe had verified the truth of Fritz's intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"None of us,\" unanimously replied all the boys.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand that the question I put to you is, under the\r\ncircumstances in which we are placed, one of the greatest moment. If,\r\ntherefore, there is any unseemly joking, any trick, or secret project\r\nin contemplation, with which this affair is connected, do not conceal\r\nit any longer.\"\r\n\r\nAll the boys again reiterated their innocence of the matter in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBecker then called to mind the mysterious disappearance of Willis,\r\nand, although they were too short in duration to admit of his having\r\nbeen at Falcon's Nest, still he deemed it advisable to put the\r\nquestion to him individually.\r\n\r\nWillis declared that the present was the first time he had been in the\r\nvicinity of the Nest, and his word was known to be sacred.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no mistake then,\" said Becker; \"the traces are\r\nself-evident. This is altogether a circumstance calculated to give us\r\nserious uneasiness. Nevertheless, we must view the matter calmly, and\r\nconsider what steps we should take to unravel the mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us instantly beat up the island,\" suggested Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me,\" remarked Willis, \"that the _Nelson_ has been\r\nwrecked after all, and that one of the men has escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied Ernest, \"is very unlikely. All the crew knew that the\r\nisland was inhabited, and consequently, had any one of them been\r\nthrown on shore, he would have come at once to Rockhouse, and not\r\nstopped here.\"\r\n\r\n\"As regards the Captain or Lieutenant Dunsley,\" said Willis, \"who were\r\non shore, and could easily find their way, what you say is quite true;\r\nbut the men were kept on board; and if we suppose that a sailor had\r\nbeen thrown on the opposite coast, he would not be able to determine\r\nhis position in fifteen days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much less could he expect to find a villa in a fig-tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"To say nothing of the light that has been kept burning recently on\r\nShark's Island, nor of the buildings with which the land is strewn,\r\nnor the fields and plantations that are to be met with in all\r\ndirections. For, although a swallow alone is sufficient to convey the\r\nseeds of a forest from one continent to another, still it requires the\r\nhand of man to arrange the trees in rows and furnish them with props.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we may have crossed each other on the way; and the stranger,\r\nafter passing the night here, has steered, by some circuitous route,\r\nin the direction of Safety Bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"May it not have been a large monkey,\" suggested Jack, \"who has\r\nresolved to play us a trick for having massacred its companions at\r\nWaldeck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monkeys,\" replied Ernest, \"do not generally open doors, and, seeing\r\nno bed prepared for them, go down stairs and collect material for a\r\nmattress. You may just as well fancy that the monkey, in this case,\r\ncame to pass the night at Falcon's Nest with a cigar in its mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he must have been dreadfully annoyed to find neither slippers\r\nnor a night-cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is, unquestionably, a wide field of supposition open for us,\"\r\nsaid Becker; \"but that need not prevent us taking active measures to\r\narrive at the truth. Our first duty is to care for the safety of the\r\nladies; Mr. Wolston is still ailing and feeble, so that, if a stranger\r\nwere suddenly to appear amongst them, they might be terribly\r\nalarmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are six of us here,\" remarked Willis, \"the cream of our sea and\r\nland forces; we could divide ourselves into three squadrons, one of\r\nwhich might sail for Rockhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; let Fritz and Frank start for Rockhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what shall we say to the ladies, father?\" inquired the latter;\r\n\"it does not seem to me necessary to alarm our mother, Mrs. Wolston,\r\nand the young ladies, until something more certain is ascertained.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your idea is good, my son, and I thank you for bringing it forward;\r\nit is one of those that arise from the heart rather than the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have, only to find a pretext for their sudden return,\" observed\r\nErnest.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Jack, \"they have only to say it is too hot to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as if it were not quite as hot for us as for them. Your excuse,\r\nJack, is not particularly artistic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might they not as well say they had forgotten a tool or a pocket\r\nhandkerchief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, better still, that they had forgotten to shut the door when they\r\nleft, and came back to repair the omission.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall say,\" replied Fritz, \"that, finding there were twelve strong\r\narms here to do what my father accomplished fifteen years ago by\r\nhimself--for the assistance of us boys could not then be reckoned--we\r\nwere ashamed of ourselves, and had returned to Rockhouse to make\r\nourselves useful in repairing the damage to the gallery caused by the\r\ntempest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that excuse has, at least, the merit of being reasonable; and\r\nlet it be so. Fritz and Frank will return to Rockhouse; Ernest and\r\nmyself will continue the work in hand, and receive the friend or enemy\r\nwhich God has sent us, should he return to resume his quarters; Willis\r\nand Jack will investigate the neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"By land or water, Willis?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"By land, Master Jack, for this cruise. I shall abandon the helm to\r\nyou, for I know nothing of the shoals here-abouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" continued Becker, \"though highly improbable, any thing important\r\nshould have happened, or should happen at Rockhouse, you will fire a\r\ncannon, and we will be with you immediately. Willis and Jack will\r\ndischarge a rifle if threatened with danger; and we shall do the same\r\non our side, if we require assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity,\" remarked Jack, \"that we had not two or three\r\nfour-pounders amongst the provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely regard this matter as altogether a subject for joking,\"\r\ncontinued Becker, \"and sincerely hope that all our precautions may\r\nprove useless. Take each of you a rifle and proceed with caution;\r\nabove all, do not go far apart from each other; do not fire without\r\ntaking good aim, and only in case of self-defence or absolute\r\nnecessity; for this time it does not appear to be a question of bears\r\nand hyenas, but, as far as we are able to judge, one of our own\r\nspecies.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the squadrons then hauled off in different directions,\r\ncarefully examining the ground as they went, beating up the thickets,\r\nand endeavoring to obtain some further trace of the stranger, in order\r\nto confirm those at Falcon's Nest.\r\n\r\nThe squadron of observation, in the meanwhile set diligently to work.\r\nA tree having been selected at about fifteen paces from that already\r\nexisting, it was necessary, as on the former occasion, to discharge an\r\narrow carrying the end of a line, and in such a way that the cord\r\nmight fall across some of the strongest branches; this done, the\r\nbamboo ladder was drawn up from the opposite side and held fast until\r\nErnest had ascended and fastened it with nails to the top of the tree.\r\n\r\nErnest then commenced lopping off the branches to the right and left,\r\nso as to form a space in the centre for their contemplated dwelling;\r\nwhilst Becker himself below was making an entrance into the trunk,\r\ntaking care to avoid an accident that formerly happened, by assuring\r\nhimself that a colony of bees had not already taken possession of the\r\nground. The gigantic fig-trees at Falcon's Nest being for the most\r\npart hollow, and supported in a great measure by the bark--like the\r\nwillows in Europe when they reach a certain stage of their growth--it\r\nwas easy to erect a staircase in the interior; still this was a work\r\nof time, and Becker had resolved in the meantime to give up the\r\nhabitation already constructed to Wolston and his family, at least\r\nuntil such time as an entrance was attached to the new one that did\r\nnot require any extraordinary amount of gymnastics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA portion of the day had been occupied in these operations, when\r\nWillis and Jack returned to the camp.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Jack, \"we are on the track of Fritz's knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be good enough to explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, at the entrance to the cocoa-nut tree wood we stumbled\r\nupon two sugar canes completely divested of their juice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which proves--\" said Ernest; but his remark was cut short by Jack,\r\nwho continued--\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it; a philosopher would have passed these two worthless\r\nsugar canes just as a place-hunter passes an overthrown minister, that\r\nis, as unworthy of notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I, the headless, the thoughtless, the stupid--for these are the\r\nepithets I am usually favored with--I took them up, scrutinized them\r\ncarefully, and discovered--\"\r\n\r\n\"That they were sugar canes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first instance, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very clever, that!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then that they had not been torn up--_they had been cut_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, most wise and learned brother, that is all; and I leave you to\r\ndraw the inferences.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may add,\" observed the sailor, \"that, as we were steering for the\r\nplantation, myself on the starboard and Jack on the larboard--\"\r\n\r\n\"On the what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master Jack on the left and myself on the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I pitched right over these canes without ever noticing them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is not much to be wondered at; Willis has been so long at sea\r\nthat he has no confidence in the solidity of the land; during our\r\ncruise, he kept a look-out after the wind, expecting, I suppose, that\r\nit would perform some of the wonderful things you spoke of this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" observed Becker, \"this is another link in the chain of\r\nevidence, and I congratulate Jack on his sagacity in tracing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the affair is as much a mystery as ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; and the solution may probably be awaiting us at Rockhouse.\"\r\n\r\nThe united squadrons then started on their homeward voyage, Jack\r\nthrusting his nose into every bush, and carefully scanning all the\r\nstray objects that seemed to be out of their normal position.\r\n\r\n\"If these plants and bushes had tongues,\" said Jack, \"they could\r\nprobably give us the information we require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" inquired Ernest, \"that plants and bushes are utterly\r\nwithout sensation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, I can't say,\" replied Jack; \"perhaps they can speak if they\r\nliked--probably they have an idiom of their own. You, that know all\r\nlanguages, and a great many more besides, possibly can converse with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know,\" said Becker, \"why you two gentlemen are\r\nalways snarling at each other; it is neither amusing nor amiable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ernest is continually showing me up, father, and it is but fair that\r\nI should be allowed to retort now and then. But to return to plants,\r\nErnest; you say they have nerves?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they have,\" said Willis, \"they do not seem to possess the bottle\r\nof salts that most nervous ladies usually have.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ernest, \"they have no nerves, properly so called; but\r\nthere are plants, and I may add many plants, which, by their\r\nqualities--I may almost say by their intelligence--seem to be placed\r\nmuch higher in the scale of creation than they really are. The\r\nsensitive plant, for example, shrinks when it is touched; tulips open\r\ntheir petals when the weather is fine, and shut them again at sunset\r\nor when it rains; wild barley, when placed on a table, often moves by\r\nitself, especially when it has been first warmed by the hand; the\r\nheliotrope always turns the face of its flowers to the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"A still more singular instance of this kind was recently discovered\r\nin Carolina,\" remarked Becker; \"it is called the _fly-trap_. Its round\r\nleaves secrete a sugary fluid, and are covered with a number of ridges\r\nwhich are extremely irritable: whenever a fly touches the surface the\r\nleaf immediately folds inwards, contracts, and continues this process\r\ntill its victim is either pierced with its spines or stifled by the\r\npressure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is probably a Corsican plant,\" observed Jack, \"whose ancestors\r\nhave had a misunderstanding with the brotherhood of flies, and have\r\nleft the _Vendetta_ as a legacy to their descendants.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in Nature,\" continued Ernest, \"so obstinate as a\r\nplant. Let us take one, for example, at its birth, that is, to-day, at\r\nthe age when animals modify or acquire their instincts, and you will\r\nfind that your own will must yield to that of the plant.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean to say that the plant will refuse to play on the flute or\r\nlearn to dance, were I to wish it to do so, I am entirely of your\r\nopinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but suppose you were to plant it upside down, with the plantule\r\nabove and the radicle below; do you think it would grow that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plantule and radicle are ambitious words, my dear brother; recollect\r\nthat you are speaking to simple mortals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I mean root uppermost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right; I prefer that, don't you, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"At first the radicle or root would begin by growing upwards, and the\r\nplantule or germ would descend.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite in accordance with my revolutionary idiosyncracies.\"\r\n\r\n\"You accused me just now of using ambitious words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I understand a revolution to mean, placing those above who\r\nshould be below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nature then,\" continued Ernest, \"very soon begins to assert her\r\nrights; the bud gradually twists itself round and ascends, whilst the\r\nroot obeys a similar impulse and descends--is not this a proof of\r\ndiscernment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing more in it than a proof of the wonderful mechanism God\r\nhas allotted to the plant, and is analogous to the movements of a\r\nwatch, the hands of which point out the hours, minutes, and seconds of\r\ntime, and are yet not endowed with intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Jack,\" said Becker.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" continued Ernest, \"that the ground in the neighborhood of\r\nyour plant was of two very opposite qualities, that on the right, for\r\nexample, damp, rich, and spongy; that on the left, dry, poor, and\r\nrocky; you would find that the roots, after growing for a time up or\r\ndown, as the case might be, will very soon change their route, and\r\ntake their course towards the rich and humid soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"And quite right too,\" said Willis; \"they prefer to go where they will\r\nbe best fed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, then, these roots stretched out to points where they would\r\nwithdraw the nourishment from other plants in the neighborhood--how\r\ncould you prevent it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By digging a ditch between them and the plants they threaten to\r\nimpoverish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you suppose that would be sufficient?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, unless the plant you refer to was an engineer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therein lies the difficulty. Plants are engineers; they would send\r\ntheir roots along the bottom of the ditch, or they would creep under\r\nit--at all events, the roots would find their way to the coveted soil\r\nin spite of you; if you dug a mine, they would countermine it, and\r\nobtain supplies from the opposite territory, and revenge themselves\r\nthere for the scurvy treatment to which they had been subjected. What\r\ncould you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, I should admit myself defeated.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" continued Ernest, \"we present a sponge saturated with water to\r\nthe naked roots of a plant, they will slowly, but steadily, direct\r\nthemselves towards it; and, turn the sponge whichever way you will,\r\nthey will take the same direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been concluded,\" remarked Becker, \"from these incontestable\r\nfacts, that plants are not devoid of sensibility; and, in fact, when\r\nwe behold them lying down at sunset as if dead, and come to life again\r\nnext morning, we are forced to recognise a degree of irritability in\r\nthe vegetable organs which very closely resemble those of the animal\r\neconomy.\"\r\n\r\n\"In future,\" said Jack, \"I shall take care not to tread upon a weed,\r\nlost, being hurt, it should scream.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, they have not been found to possess any other sign\r\nof this supposed sensibility. All their other functions seem perfectly\r\nmechanical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah then, father,\" exclaimed Jack, \"you are a believer in my system!\"\r\n\r\n\"We make them grow and destroy them, without observing anything\r\nanalogous to the sensation we feel in rearing, wounding, or killing an\r\nanimal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the fly-trap, father, what of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no exception. The fly-trap seizes any small body that touches\r\nit, as well as an insect, and with the same tenacity; hence, we may\r\nreadily conclude that these actions, so apparently spontaneous, are in\r\nreality nothing more than remarkable developments of the laws of\r\nirritability peculiar to plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not, then, spring from a family feud, as Jack supposed?\"\r\nremarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" continued Becker, \"if plants really existed, possessing\r\nwhat is understood by the term sensation, they would be animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a like reason, animals without sensation would be plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently. Moreover, the transition from vegetable to animal life is\r\nalmost imperceptible, so much so, that polypi, such as corals and\r\nsponges, were for a long time supposed to be marine plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are they?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Insects that live in communities that form a multitude of contiguous\r\ncells; some of these are begun at the bottom of the sea and\r\naccumulated perpendicularly, one layer being continually deposited\r\nover another till the surface is reached.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the coral reefs, that render navigation so perilous in unknown\r\nseas, are the work of insects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might they not as well consist of multitudes of insects piled heaps\r\nupon heaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in a great measure as you say, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I--I do not say it--quite the contrary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Willis, you are at liberty to believe it or not, as you think\r\nproper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so; we shall, therefore, put the polypi with Ernest's stars\r\nand Jack's admirals.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, Willis; but to resume the subject. There is a remarkable\r\nanalogy in many respects between the lower orders of animals and\r\nplants, the bulb is to the latter what the egg is to the former. The\r\ngerm does not pierce the bulb till it attains a certain organization,\r\nand it remains attached by fibres to the parent substance, from which,\r\nfor a time, it receives nourishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unlike the young of animals,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"When the germ has shot out roots and a leaf or two, it then, but not\r\ntill then, relinquishes the parent bulb. The plant then grows by an\r\nextension and multiplication of its parts, and this extension is\r\naccompanied by an increasing induration of the fibres. The same\r\nphenomena are observed as regards animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious!\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Animals, however, are sometimes oviparous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oviparous?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is, they lay eggs; others are viviparous, producing their\r\nyoung alive. A few are multiplied like plants by cuttings, as in the\r\ncase of the polypi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother the polypi,\" said Willis, laughing, \"since we have to thank\r\nthem for destroying some of his Majesty's ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then again,\" continued Becker, \"both plants and animals are subject\r\nto disease, decay, and death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, if the analogies are remarkable, the differences are not\r\nless marked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ernest, I shall leave you to point them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without reckoning the faculty of feeling, that cannot be denied to\r\nthe one nor granted to the other, the most striking of these\r\ndistinctions consists in the circumstance that animals can change\r\nplace, whilst this faculty is absolutely refused to plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we except those,\" remarked Jack, \"that insist upon travelling to\r\nthe succulent parts of the earth, and are as indefatigable in digging\r\ntunnels as the renowned Brunel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then plants are obliged to accept the nourishment that their fixed\r\nposition furnishes to them; whilst animals, on the contrary, by means\r\nof their external organs, can range far and near in search of the\r\naliments most congenial to their appetites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is often very capricious,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Then, considered with regard to magnitude, the two kingdoms present\r\nremarkable distinctions; the interval between a whale and a mite is\r\ngreater than between the moss and the oak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" cried Jack, \"there is Miss Sophia coming to meet us, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they have news at the grotto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" inquired the child, \"have you seen them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" thought Becker, \"our chatterers have not been able to hold\r\ntheir tongues; I am surprised at that as regards Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"We expected to have found them at Rockhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"To have found whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sailors from the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely hope that the _Nelson_ has not been wrecked.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, whom do you refer to yourself, Miss Sophia?\"\r\n\r\n\"To your go-cart and my doll, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHABITANT OF THE MOON, ANTHROPOPHAGIAN OR HOBGOBLIN?--THE LACEDEMONIAN\r\nSTEW OF MADAME DACIER--UTILE DULCI--TETE-A-TETE BETWEEN WILLIS AND HIS\r\nPIPE--TOBACCO VERSUS BIRCH--IS IT FOR EATING?--MOSQUITOES--THE\r\nALARM--TOBY--THE NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION--WE'VE GOT HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome days passed without anything having occurred to ruffle the\r\ntranquil existence of the island families. Every morning the _élite_\r\nof the sea and land forces continued to divide themselves into three\r\nsquadrons of observation; one of which remained at Rockhouse on some\r\npretext or other, whilst the other two were occupied in exploring the\r\ncountry, or in carrying on the works at Falcon's Nest.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious stranger, whether shipwrecked seaman, savage, or\r\nhobgoblin, who kept all the bearded inhabitants of Rockhouse on the\r\nalert, had reappeared in his old quarters, where another litter of\r\nleaves had been miraculously strewn exactly in the same place the\r\nformer had occupied.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, however, and sundry gashes here and there--of which\r\nFritz's knife was clearly guilty, but which could not have been\r\nperpetrated without an accomplice--nothing had transpired to enable\r\nthem to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to who or what this\r\npersonage could be.\r\n\r\nThough the hypothesis was highly improbable, still Willis persisted in\r\nhis theory of the shipwreck; he only doubted whether the individual on\r\nshore was a marine or the cabin-boy, an officer or a foremast man,\r\nand, if the latter, whether it was Bill, Tom, Bob, or Ned.\r\n\r\nErnest rather inclined to think that the invisible stranger was an\r\ninhabitant of the moon, who, in consequence of a false step, had\r\ntumbled from his own to our planet.\r\n\r\nThe warlike Fritz was impatient and irritated. He would over and over\r\nagain have preferred an immediate solution of the affair, even were it\r\nbathed in blood, rather than be kept any longer in suspense.\r\n\r\nFrank, on the contrary, took a metaphysical view of the case; and,\r\nbelieving that Providence had not entirely dispensed with miracles in\r\ndealing with the things of this world, came to the conclusion that it\r\nwas no earthly visitor they had to deal with; and he even went so far\r\nas to hint that prayer was a more efficacious means of solving the\r\nmystery than the methods his brothers were pursuing.\r\n\r\nJack, coinciding in some degree with Ernest, shifted his view from an\r\nape to an anthropophagian, and blamed the latter for not coming\r\nearlier; when he and his brothers were younger, and consequently more\r\ntender, they would have made a better meal, and been more easily\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\nAs to what opinion Becker himself entertained, with regard to the\r\noccurrence at Falcon's Nest that kept his sons in a feverish state of\r\nanxiety, and had awakened all the fears of the Pilot for the safety of\r\nhis friends on board the _Nelson_, nothing could be clearly\r\nascertained; in so far as this matter was concerned he kept his own\r\ncounsel; and, to use an expression of Madame de Sevigné, \"had thrown\r\nhis tongue to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\nThe close of the day had, as usual, collected all the members of the\r\nfamily round the domestic hearth; and it may be stated here that Mrs.\r\nWolston, Mary, and Mrs. Becker alternately undertook the preparations\r\nof the viands for the diurnal consumption of the community. By this\r\nmeans, uniformity, that palls the appetite, was entirely banished from\r\ntheir dishes. One day they would have the cooked, or rather\r\nhalf-cooked, British joints of Mrs. Wolston and her daughter, varied\r\noccasionally, to the great delight of Willis, with a tureen of\r\nhotch-potch or cocky-leekie. The next there would be a display of the\r\ncosmopolite and somewhat picturesque cookery of Mrs. Becker; there was\r\nher famous peccary pie, with ravansara sauce, followed by her\r\ndelicious preserved mango and seaweed jelly. Nor did she hesitate to\r\ndraw upon the raw material of the colony now and then for a new hash\r\nor soup, taking care, however, to keep in view the maxim that\r\nprudence is the mother of safety--an adage that was rather roughly\r\nhandled by the renowned French linguist, Madame Dacier, who, on one\r\noccasion nearly poisoned her husband with a Lacedemonian stew, the\r\nreceipt for which she had found in Xenophon.\r\n\r\nLuckily Becker's wife did not know Greek, consequently he ran no risk\r\nof being entertained with a classic dinner; but he was often reminded\r\nby his thoughtful partner of Meg Dod's celebrated receipt: before you\r\ncook your hare, first--catch it.\r\n\r\nSophia desired earnestly to have a share in the culinary government;\r\nbut having shown on her first trial, too decided a leaning towards\r\npuddings and pancakes, her second essay was put off till she became\r\nmore thoroughly penetrated with the value of the eternal precept\r\n_utile dulci_, which signifies that, before dessert it is requisite to\r\nhave something substantial.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished their afternoon meal, Willis departed on\r\none of his customary mysterious excursions; and Jack, who, like the\r\nbirds that no sooner hop upon one branch than they leap upon another,\r\nhad also disappeared. It was not long, however, before he made his\r\nappearance again; he came running in almost out of breath, and cried\r\nat the top of his voice,\r\n\r\n\"I have discovered him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\" exclaimed half a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitant of the moon?\" inquired Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Sophia playfully, \"your go-cart and my doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have discovered Willis' secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have been watching him, it is very wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father; seeing some thin columns of smoke rising out of a\r\nthicket, I thought a bush was on fire; but on going nearer, I saw that\r\nit was only a tobacco-pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the pipe alone, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly, it was in Willis' mouth; and there he sat, so\r\ncompletely immersed in ideas and smoke, that he neither heard nor saw\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"That he does not smoke here,\" remarked Becker, \"I can easily\r\nunderstand; but why conceal it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" replied Mrs. Wolston, \"you do not know Willis yet;--beneath that\r\nrough exterior there are feelings that would grace a coronet: he is,\r\nno doubt, afraid of leading your sons into the habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very thoughtful and considerate on his part.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was always smoking on board ship, and it must have been a great\r\nsacrifice for him to leave it off to the extent he has done lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall not allow him to punish himself any longer; and as for\r\nthe danger of contagion from his smoking here, that evil may perhaps\r\nbe avoided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid, father; it will not be necessary to establish\r\neither a quarantine or a lazaretto on our account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, any of the boys,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"that acquire the habit,\r\nwill, by so doing, voluntarily banish themselves from my levees.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an extraordinary habit that, smoking,\" observed Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Becker; \"and what makes the habit more singular is, that\r\nit holds out no allurements to seduce its votaries. Generally, the\r\npath to vice, or to a bad habit, is strewn with roses that hide their\r\nthorns, but such is not the case with smoking; in order to acquire\r\nthis habit, a variety of disagreeable difficulties have to be\r\novercome, and a considerable amount of disgust and sickness must be\r\nborne before the stomach is tutored to withstand the nauseous fumes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In point of fact,\" observed Wolston, \"if, instead of being made part\r\nand parcel of the appliances of a fashionable man, cigars and\r\nmeershaums were classed in the pharmacopoeia with emetics and\r\ncataplasms, there is not a human being but would bemoan his fate if\r\ncompelled to undergo a dose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" added Becker; \"the great and sole attraction of tobacco to\r\nyoung people consists in its being to them a forbidden thing; the\r\napple of Eve is of all time--it hangs from every tree, and takes\r\nmyriads of shapes. If I had the honor of being principal of a college\r\nI should no more think of forbidding the pupils to use tobacco than I\r\nshould think of commanding them not to use the birch for purposes of\r\nself-chastisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would be quite right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Instead of lecturing them on the pernicious effects of tobacco, I\r\nshould hang up a pipe of punishment in the class-room, and oblige\r\noffending pupils to inhale a fixed number of whiffs proportionate to\r\nthe gravity of their delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent idea,\" observed Wolston; \"for it is often only necessary\r\nto show some things in a different light in order to give them a new\r\naspect and value. This puts me in mind of an illustration in point;\r\nthese two girls, when children, were the parties concerned, and I will\r\nrelate the circumstance to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Mary, \"I shall go and feed the fowls.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Sophia, \"must go and water the flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then,\" cried Jack laughing, \"it is another doll story, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Master Jack, it is not a doll story; and, besides, we girls were\r\nno bigger at the time than that.\"\r\n\r\nOn saying this Sophia placed her two hands about a foot and a half\r\nfrom the floor and then the two girls vanished.\r\n\r\n\"When Mary was about six years old,\" began Wolston, \"a slight rash\r\nthreatened to develope itself, and the doctor ordered a small blister\r\nto be applied to one of her arms. Now, there was likely to be some\r\ndifficulty about getting her to submit quietly to this operation, so,\r\nafter an instant's reflection, I called both her and her sister, and\r\ntold them that the most diligent of the two should have a vesicatory\r\nput on her arm at night. 'Oh,' cried both the girls quite delighted,\r\n'it will be me, papa, I shall be so good. Mamma, mamma--such a\r\ntreat--papa has promised us a vesicatory for to-night!'\"\r\n\r\n\"That was simplicity itself,\" said Mrs. Becker, laughing till the\r\ntears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The day passed, the one endeavoring to excel the other in the\r\nquantity of leaves they turned over; and, from time to time, I heard\r\nthe one asking the other in a low voice, 'Have you ever seen a\r\nvesicatory? What is it made of? Is it for eating? And each in turn\r\nregarded her arms, to judge in advance the effect of the marvellous\r\nornament.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like much to have seen them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Night came, and I declared gravely that the eldest was fairly\r\nentitled to the prize. The latter jumped about with joy, and Sophia\r\nbegan to cry. 'Don't cry,' said Mary, 'if you are good, papa will,\r\nperhaps, give you one to-morrow, too,' Then the joyful patient,\r\nturning to me, said, 'On which arm, papa?' and I told her that the\r\nceremony of placing it on must take place when she was in bed. To bed\r\naccordingly she went, the ornament was applied, she looked at it, was\r\npleased with it, thanked me for it, and fell asleep as happy as a\r\nqueen. But, alas! like that of many queens, the felicity did not last\r\nlong; before morning, I heard her saying to her sister, in a doleful\r\ntone, 'Soffy, will you have my vesicatory?' 'Oh, yes, just lend it to\r\nme for a tiny moment.' At this I hurried to the spot, and, as you may\r\nreadily suppose, opposed the transfer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Sophia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she was quite heart-broken, and said, sobbing, 'It is always\r\nMary that gets everything, nobody ever gives anything to me.'\"\r\n\r\nNext day, Willis laid hold of his sou'-wester, and was starting off on\r\nhis customary pilgrimage, when Becker stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Willis,\" said he, \"have you any objections to state what the\r\nengagements are, that require you to leave us at pretty much the same\r\nhour every day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely go for a walk, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see I require to take a turn just after dinner for the sake of my\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"A habit that you contracted on board ship; eh, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"On board ship; yes Mr. Becker, that is to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" observed Mrs. Wolston; \"and by the way, Willis, I regret\r\nthat you do not smoke now; they say there is plenty of tobacco on the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smoke!\" cried Willis, raising his ears like a war-horse at the sound\r\nof the trumpet, \"why so, Mrs. Wolston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are dreadfully tormented with those horrid mosquitoes, and\r\nyou might help us to get rid of them. You smoked at sea, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam; but then my constitution--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Wolston, \"I thought you were as strong as a horse,\r\nWillis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have no cause to complain neither; but then they say tobacco\r\nwould kill even a horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Willis, your health is a most necessary consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still for all that, if the mosquitoes really do annoy Mrs. Wolston, I\r\nshould have no objection to take a whiff now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not put yourself about though, on our account, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"About; no, it would not put me about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; then it only remains to be seen whether there is a pipe in\r\nthe colony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Willis, feeling his pockets, \"yes, exactly--here is one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious how things do turn up, isn't it, Willis?\" said Becker; \"but\r\nthe mosquitoes would not be frightened away by the smoke, if applied\r\nat long intervals, so you will have to repeat the dose at least two or\r\nthree times every day, always supposing it does not affect your\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sailors, you see,\" replied Willis, \"are like chimneys, they always\r\nsmoke when you want them, and sometimes a great deal more than you\r\nwant them,\" And on turning round, he beheld Sophia holding a light,\r\nand a good-sized case of Maryland, which had been preserved from the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nEver after that time the mosquitoes had a most persevering enemy in\r\nWillis; and, notwithstanding his health, his daily walks entirely\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Pilot and the four young men passed the night in a\r\ntent erected about midway between Rockhouse and the Jackal River. The\r\napparent reason for this modification of their plans was the greater\r\nfacility it afforded for their all meeting at daybreak, breakfasting\r\ntogether, and setting out for Falcon's Nest before the temperature\r\nreached ninety degrees in the shade, which junction could not be so\r\neasily effected with one party encamped at Rockhouse and the other\r\nbivouacked on Shark's Island, with an arm of the sea between them.\r\n\r\nThe real motive, however, was that all might be within hail of each\r\nother, and prepared for every emergency, in the event of the stranger\r\nappearing in a more palpable shape, and assuming a hostile attitude.\r\nWe say the stranger, because, judging from the indications, there was\r\nonly one--still that did not prove that there might not be several.\r\n\r\nOne night, as Fritz was lying with one eye open, he observed Mary's\r\nlittle black terrier suddenly prick up the fragments of its ears, and\r\nbegin sniffing at the edge of the tent. This shaggy little cur was\r\ncalled Toby; it had accompanied the Wolstons on their voyage, and was\r\nMary's exclusive property; but Fritz had found the way to the animal's\r\nheart as usual through its stomach, and Mary was in no way jealous of\r\nhis attentions to her favorite, but rather the reverse.\r\n\r\nFritz, feeling convinced by the actions of the dog, which was of the\r\ntrue Scotch breed, that something extraordinary was passing outside\r\nthe tent, seized his rifle, hastened out, and was just in time to\r\ndistinguish a human figure on the opposite bank of the Jackal River,\r\nwhich, on seeing him, took to its heels and disappeared in the forest.\r\n\r\nHe was soon joined by the Pilot and his brothers; the dogs leaped\r\nabout them, and the alarm became general throughout the encampment.\r\nFritz re-established order, enjoined silence, and said,\r\n\r\n\"I am determined this time to follow the affair up; who will accompany\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" said all the four voices at once.\r\n\r\n\"Scouting parties ought not to be numerous,\" said Fritz; \"I will,\r\ntherefore, take Willis, in case this mystification has anything to do\r\nwith the _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me,\" said Jack, \"to serve as a dessert, in case the individual\r\nshould turn out to be an anthropophagian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so; but no more. Frank and Ernest will remain to tranquilize\r\nour parents, in case we should not return before they are up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if so, what shall we say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them the truth. We shall proceed direct to Falcon's Nest; and if\r\nthe stranger--confiding in our habit of sleeping during the night--be\r\nthere as usual, we shall do ourselves the honor of helping him to get\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Providing he does not nightly change his quarters like Oliver\r\nCromwell--not so much to avoid enemies, as to calm his uneasy\r\nconscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall be no worse than before; we shall have tried to\r\nrestore our wonted quietude, and, if we fail, we can say, like Francis\r\nI. at Pavia, '_All is lost except our honor_.'\"\r\n\r\nSome minutes after this conversation, three shadows might have been\r\nseen stealing through the glades in the direction of Falcon's Nest.\r\nNothing was to be heard but the rustling of the leaves--the deafened\r\nbeating of the sea upon the rocks--and, to use the words of Lamartine,\r\n\"those unknown tongues that night and the wind whisper in the air.\"\r\nThe trees were mirrored in the rays of the moon, and the ground, at\r\nintervals, seemed strewn with monstrous giants; their hearts beat, not\r\nwith fear, but with that feverish impatience that anticipates decisive\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the foot of the tree on which the aerial dwelling\r\nwas situated, Fritz opened the door, and resolutely, but stealthily,\r\nascended.\r\n\r\nWillis and Jack followed him with military precision.\r\n\r\nThey reached the top of the staircase, and held the latch of the door\r\nthat opened into the apartment.\r\n\r\nA train of mice, in the strictest incognito, could not have performed\r\nthese operations with a greater amount of secretiveness. On opening\r\nthe door they stood and listened.\r\n\r\nNot a sound. Jack fired off a pistol, and the fraudulent occupier of\r\nthe room instantly started up on his feet. Fritz rushed forward, and\r\nclasped him tightly round the body.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho, comrade,\" said he, \"this time you do not get off so easily!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CHIMPANZEE--IMPERFECT NEGRO, OR PERFECT APE--THE HARMONIES OF\r\nNATURE--A HANDFUL OF PAWS--A STONE SKIN--SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SPECTACLES\r\nON ONE NOSE--ANIMALCULÆ--PELION ON OSSA--PTOLEMY--COPERNICUS TO\r\nGALILEO--METAPHYSICS AND COSMOGONIES--ISAIAH--A LIVE TIGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The chimpanzé or chimpanzee,\" says Buffon, the French naturalist, \"is\r\nmuch more sagacious than the _ourang outang_, with which it has been\r\ninaccurately confounded; it likewise bears a more marked resemblance\r\nto the human being; the height is the same, and it has the same\r\naspect, members, and strength; it always walks on two feet, with the\r\nhead erect, has no tail, has calves to its legs, hair on its head, a\r\nbeard on its chin, a face that Grimaldi would have envied, hands and\r\nnails like those of men, whose manners and habits it is susceptible of\r\nacquiring.\"\r\n\r\nBuffon knew an individual of the species that sat demurely at table,\r\ntaking his place with the other guests; like them he would spread out\r\nhis napkin, and stick one corner of it into his button-hole just as\r\nthey did, and he was exceedingly dexterous in the use of his knife,\r\nfork, and spoon. Spectators were not a little surprised to see him go\r\nto a bed made for him, tie up his head in a pocket-handkerchief, place\r\nit sideways on a pillow, tuck himself carefully in the bed-clothes,\r\npretend to be sick, stretch out his pulse to be felt, and affect to\r\nundergo the process of being bled.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist adds that he is very easily taught, and may be made a\r\nuseful domestic servant, at least as regards the humbler operations of\r\nthe kitchen; he promptly obeys signs and the voice, whilst other\r\nspecies of apes only obey the stick; he will rinse glasses, serve at\r\ntable, turn the spit, grind coffee, or carry water. Add to his virtues\r\nas a domestic, that he is not much addicted to chattering about the\r\nfamily affairs, has no followers, and is very accommodating in the\r\nmatter of wages.\r\n\r\nIt was neither more nor less than a chimpanzee that Fritz had caught\r\nin the dark at Falcon's Nest.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, old fellow,\" said he, \"you will help us to clear up this\r\nmysterious affair.\"\r\n\r\nThe caged stranger made no reply to this observation; Willis and Jack\r\nthen questioned him, the one in English and the other in French.\r\n\r\nStill no reply.\r\n\r\nHe did not submit, however, to be interrogated quietly; on the\r\ncontrary, his struggles to get away were most vigorous, so much so\r\nthat Fritz adopted the precaution of binding him.\r\n\r\n\"If it had been one of our sailors,\" said Willis, \"he would have\r\nrecognized my voice long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked one.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\" inquired another.\r\n\r\n\"Do not attempt to escape,\" said a third.\r\n\r\n\"We mean you no harm; on the contrary, we are friends, disposed to do\r\nyou good if we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"If all his brothers and sisters are as talkative as himself,\"\r\nremarked Jack, \"they must be a very amusing sort of people.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can walk at all events,\" said Fritz giving him a smart push.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee fell flat on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"It appears, sir, that you are determined to have your own way, we\r\nmust therefore wait till daylight.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour passed in polyglot expostulations with the stranger on the\r\nscore of his obstinacy, but all to no purpose; to use a popular\r\nexpression, he was as dumb as the Doges. He deigned, however, to empty\r\nat a single draught a calabash of Malaga that Willis gave him, but\r\nthere his condescension stopped.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot, who now encountered mosquitoes in all directions, made\r\npreparations for smoking; the light he struck, however, instead of\r\nclearing up the mystery, only perplexed them more and more; there lay\r\ntheir new companion, stretched on the ground, staring at them with a\r\nludicrous grin.\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, it occurred to them this man was an animal, on\r\nthe other the animal was a man, and Buffon did not happen to be there\r\nat the time to assign him officially a place in the former kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty that presented itself was, how they were to get\r\nhim along; when they broke in the onagra, they ran a prong through his\r\near; in reducing the buffalo to subjection, they did not feel the\r\nslightest compunction in thrusting a pin through the cartilage of his\r\nnose; then, in order to give elasticity to the legs of the ostrich,\r\nthey yoked him to two or three other animals, and, willing or\r\nunwilling, he was compelled ultimately to yield obedience to the lords\r\nof creation. But whether the creature before them was a lower order of\r\nnegro or a higher order of ape, there was too great a resemblance\r\nbetween the captured and the capturers to admit of any of these\r\nmethods of impulsion being adopted. It was, therefore, stretched on a\r\nplank, like a nabob in his palanquin, that the chimpanzee made his\r\nfirst appearance at Rockhouse.\r\n\r\nWhen the cavalcade arrived there, all the family, with the exception\r\nof Ernest and Frank, were still asleep. The first thing they did was\r\nto clothe the creature they had captured in a sailor's pantaloons and\r\njacket, with which he seemed rather pleased, and the result of this\r\noperation was, that he began to assume a less ferocious aspect, and\r\nbehave more respectfully towards his captors. All the family had sat\r\ndown to breakfast, when Fritz and Jack, taking him by the hands, led\r\nhim gravely into the gallery. A cord was attached to his legs,\r\nallowing him to walk, but was so arranged that he could not run.\r\n\r\nOn his appearance the young girls fled at once; and, more accustomed\r\nto drawing-rooms than the rude realities of savage life, Mrs.\r\nWolston's first impulse was to do the same.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious!\" she cried with an air of alarm, \"what horror is\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, madam, is precisely what we have been anxious for the last two\r\nor three hours to find out,\" replied Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Does the creature speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up till now, madam,\" replied Willis, \"he has only opened his mouth to\r\nswallow my calabash of Malaga; beyond that, he has kept as close as a\r\npurser's locker.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first shock had passed, and the company had regained their\r\nself-possession, Jack related, with his customary originality, the\r\nincidents of the nocturnal expedition, of which Fritz was the\r\noriginator, leader, and hero. The ladies then, for the first time,\r\nwere made acquainted with the doubts, fears, perplexities, and\r\nbattues, which, out of gallantry, they had hitherto been kept in\r\nignorance of. Becker then, having carefully investigated the creature,\r\npronounced it to be (as we already know) a full-grown specimen of a\r\nkind of ape, called by the Africans \"the wild man of the woods,\" and\r\nby naturalists the _jocko_ or chimpanzee.\r\n\r\n\"It is naturally very savage,\" added Becker; \"but this individual\r\nseems already to have received some degree of education.\"\r\n\r\nAs a proof of this, the chimpanzee seated himself amongst them very\r\nmuch at his ease; he scanned the faces surrounding him with an air of\r\ncuriosity, and seemed to search for a particular countenance that it\r\nannoyed him not to find. Some fruit and nuts that were given him put\r\nhim in excellent humor.\r\n\r\n\"He has, without doubt, been on board some ship, wrecked on the\r\ncoast,\" said Wolston, \"for I recollect having read that his kindred\r\nare only found in Western Africa and the adjacent islands; do you not\r\nrecognize him, Willis, to belong to the _Nelson_, like the plank of\r\nthe other day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not ship such cattle on board his Majesty's ships,\" added the\r\nPilot.\r\n\r\nThe girls, ashamed of their fear, now came peeping in at the door,\r\nand, seeing that nobody had been devoured, took refuge by the side of\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, father,\" said Ernest, feeling the creature's crania,\r\nafter having facetiously begged pardon for the liberty, \"its head is\r\nprecisely like our own; that is very humiliating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my son, but his tongue and other organs are also exactly like\r\nours, yet he cannot utter a word. His head is of the same form and\r\nproportion, but he does not for all that possess human intelligence.\r\nIs this not a very striking proof that mere matter, though perfectly\r\norganized, neither produces words nor thought; and that it requires a\r\nspecial manifestation of the Divine will to call these attributes into\r\nexistence?\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but, father, some writers say that apes have been observed to\r\nprofit by fires lighted in the forest, and have gone and warmed\r\nthemselves when the travellers left.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, my son, is instinct, nothing more; the operation of keeping up\r\na fire, by throwing a few branches upon it, is exceedingly simple, but\r\ntheir instinct has never been known to rise to that amount of\r\nintelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You recollect, father, that heathcock we saw some years ago\r\ndisplaying his glossy plumage to the dazzled hens; is that not a\r\nwell-marked proof of coquetry? and is not this coquetry an indication\r\nof something more than mere instinct?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will permit me to believe, my son, at least till the contrary has\r\nbeen proved, that these actions to which you refer have nothing at all\r\nto do with coquetry. Those brilliant colors are designed for a purpose\r\nother than that which you suppose; they serve as signals to keep the\r\ncommunity together, or, in other words, they are a common centre round\r\nwhich the hens may revolve.\"\r\n\r\n\"The transition from apes to heathcocks,\" remarked Jack, \"appears to\r\nme somewhat abrupt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so abrupt as you think, Master Jack,\" said Wolston; \"those who\r\ntake the trouble to study Nature, observe an admirable gradation and\r\neasy progression from a simple to a complex organization. There is no\r\nrace or species that is not connected by a perceptible link with that\r\nwhich precedes and that which follows.\"\r\n\r\n\"What relation is there, for example,\" inquired Jack, \"between an\r\noyster and a horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"No immediate relation certainly, but there are intermediate links by\r\nwhich the two are brought together: they may be regarded, however, as\r\nthe opposite extremes of the brotherhood--the two poles in the chain\r\nof existence. A horse bears even less resemblance to a turnip than to\r\nan oyster; a relationship may, nevertheless, be traced, step by step,\r\nbetween them, dissimilar as they are. There is the polypus, that\r\nsingular product of Nature, which, regarded in one light, performs all\r\nthe functions of animal life, whilst, when regarded in another, it has\r\nthe ordinary attributes of a plant; does this not clearly and\r\ndistinctly mark the transition from the vegetable to the animal\r\nkingdom? Again, certain species of worms blend the animal with the\r\ninsect tribe, those which are covered with a horny substance unite\r\nthem with the crustaceae. These approach fish on the one hand, and\r\nreptiles on the other, whilst reptiles in some species become\r\nmoluscs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is a molusc?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"The term _molusc_ is applied by naturalists to creatures which have\r\nno vertebrae, as for example, the cuttle fish and the oyster.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe _you_, Mr. Wolston; but if I had asked Ernest or Jack, they\r\nwould have told me that it was a commodore or an admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reptiles, I was going to say, are connected at one end of the chain\r\nwith moluscs by the slug, and at the other with fish by the eel. From\r\nflying-fish to birds the transition is by no means abrupt. The\r\nostrich, whose legs are like goat's, and runs rather than flies,\r\nconnects birds with quadrupeds; these again return to fish through the\r\ncetacea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the interval between such creatures and man is still great.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; to connect the two would be a process replete with\r\ninsurmountable difficulties, and only possible to creative power. The\r\nprojecting snout would have to be flattened, and the features of\r\nhumanity imprinted upon it--that head bent upon the ground would have\r\nto be directed upwards--that narrow breast would have to be flattened\r\nout--those legs would have to be converted into flexible arms, and\r\nthose horny hoofs into nimble fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"To accomplish which,\" remarked Frank, \"God had only to say, 'Let it\r\nbe so.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly; and as there is nothing incongruous in Nature, as\r\neverything is admirably adapted for its purpose, as unity of design is\r\nperceptible in all things, as every effect proceeds from a cause, and\r\nbecomes a cause in its turn of succeeding effects, so God has willed\r\nthat there should be a chain of resemblance running through all his\r\nworks, and the link that connects man with the animal kingdom--the\r\nhighest type of the mammiferous race, and the nearest approach to\r\nhumanity amongst the brutes--is the creature before you.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to illustrate this position, and prove his title to the place\r\nawarded him, the chimpanzee quietly laid hold of Mr. Wolston's straw\r\nhat and stuck it on his crispy head.\r\n\r\n\"He is, perhaps, afraid of catching cold,\" said Jack, thrusting a mat\r\nunder his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Compare birds with quadrupeds,\" continued Mr. Wolston, \"and you will\r\nfind analogies at every step. Does the powerful and kingly eagle not\r\nresemble the noble and generous lion?--the cruel vulture, the\r\nferocious tiger?--the kite, buzzard, and crow preying upon carrion,\r\nhyenas, jackals, and wolves? Are not falcons, hawks, and other birds\r\nused in the chase, types of foxes and dogs? Is the owl, which prowls\r\nabout only at night, not a type of the cat? The cormorants and herons,\r\nthat live upon fish, are they not the otters and beavers of the air?\r\nDo not peacocks, turkeys, and the common barn-door fowl bear a\r\nstriking affinity to oxen, cows, sheep, and other ruminating animals?\"\r\n\r\nDuring these remarks, Jack's monkey, Knips, had found its way into the\r\ngallery, and, observing the newcomer, went forward to accost him as if\r\nan old friend; the latter, however, uttered a menacing cry, and was\r\nabout to seize Knips with evidently no amiable design, but was\r\nprevented by the cords that bound his legs. Knips leaped upon the back\r\nof one of the boys, and there, as if on the tower of an impregnable\r\nfortress, commenced making a series of grimaces at the chimpanzee,\r\nthese being the only missiles within reach that he could launch at his\r\nrelation. The enemy retorted, and kept up a smart fire of like\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n\"It appears,\" remarked Mrs Wolston, \"that apes are something like men:\r\nthe great and the little do not readily amalgamate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make them amalgamate,\" said Jack, taking one of Knips's paws,\r\nwhilst Ernest held that of the chimpanzee; thus they compelled them to\r\nshake hands, but with what degree of cordiality we are unable to\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to oblige them now to take an oath of fealty,\" said Mrs.\r\nWolston.\r\n\r\n\"Chimpanzee,\" said Jack, speaking for Knips, \"I promise always to\r\ntreat you in future with smiles, delicacies, and respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knips,\" replied the wild man of the woods, through the organs of\r\nErnest, \"I promise to have for you only the most generous intentions;\r\nto share with you the nuts I may have occasion to crack, that is, by\r\ngiving you the shells and keeping the kernel; I promise, moreover, not\r\nto immolate you at the altar of my just rage, unless it is impossible\r\nfor me to avoid an outburst of temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now the embrace of peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madam,\" said Jack, \"you must excuse that ceremony, their\r\nfriendship is too new for such intimacy, and Knips don't much like\r\nbeing bitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Need we other proofs,\" remarked Becker, when the scene between the\r\nmonkeys was concluded, \"that everything has been premeditated,\r\nweighed, and calculated? It was necessary for that most arid country,\r\nArabia, that we should have a sober animal, susceptible of existing a\r\nlong time without water, and capable of treading the hot sands of the\r\ndesert. God has accordingly given us the camel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the dromedary,\" remarked Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"So everywhere,\" continued Becker; \"and add to these evidences of\r\nDivine wisdom the brilliant colors, the silken furs, the golden\r\nplumage, and the ever-varying forms, yet, in all this diversity,\r\nthere is unison--a harmony. Like the various objects which a clever\r\nartist introduces into his sketch, they are placed without uniformity,\r\nbut still with reference to their effect upon each other, and so to\r\nthe unity of the general design.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" remarked Ernest, \"we have an animal whose skin is of\r\nstone, which it throws off annually to assume a new one--whose flesh\r\nis its tail and in its feet--whose hair is found inside in its\r\nbreast--whose stomach is in its head, which, like the skin, is renewed\r\nevery year, the first function of the new being to digest the old\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Pilot manifested some symptoms of incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"That is not all, Willis,\" continued Ernest, \"the animal of which I\r\nspeak carries its eggs in the interior of its body till they are\r\nhatched, and then transfers them to its tail. It has pebbles in its\r\nstomach, can throw off its limbs when they incommode it, and replace\r\nthem with others more to its fancy. To finish the portrait, its eyes\r\nare placed at the tip of long flexible horns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really mean me to believe that yarn?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Willis, unless you intend to deny the existence of lobsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lobsters! Ah! you are talking of them, are you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have not,\" continued Ernest, \"six thousand three hundred and\r\nsixty-two eyes been counted in one beetle? sixteen thousand in a fly?\r\nand as many as thirty-four thousand six hundred in a butterfly? Of\r\ncourse, facets understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supposing these facets myope or presbyte,\" observed Jack, \"that gives\r\nseventeen thousand three hundred and twenty-five pairs of spectacles\r\non one nose!\"\r\n\r\n\"How wonderfully varied are the forms of Nature. If, from the mastodon\r\nand the fossil mammoth, to which Buffon attributes five or six times\r\nthe bulk and size of the elephant, we descend to those animalculae, of\r\nwhich Leuwenhoek estimates that a thousand millions of them would not\r\noccupy the place of an ordinary grain of sand.\"\r\n\r\nHere Willis lost all patience and left the gallery, whistling as\r\nusual, under such circumstances, the \"Mariner's March.\"\r\n\r\n\"Malesieu has detected animals by the microscope twenty-seven times\r\nsmaller than a mite. A single drop of water under this instrument\r\nassumes the aspect of a lake, peopled by an infinite multitude of\r\nliving creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" observed Wolston, \"it is not the great works of Nature,\r\nor those of which the organization is most perfect, that alone\r\npresents to the mind of man the unfathomable mysteries of creation;\r\natoms become to him problems, that utterly defy the utmost efforts of\r\nhis intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which,\" suggested Becker, \"does not prevent us believing ourselves a\r\nwell of science, nor hinder us from piling Pelion on Ossa to scale the\r\nskies.\"\r\n\r\n\"What becomes, in the presence of these facts, of the metaphysics and\r\ncosmogonies that have succeeded each other for two thousand years?\r\nWhat of all the theories, from Ptolemy to Copernicus, from Copernicus\r\nto Galileo, Descartes and his zones, Leibnitz and his monads, Wolf and\r\nhis fire forces, Maupertuis and his intelligent elements, Broussais,\r\nwho, in his anatomical lectures, has oftener than once shown to his\r\npupils, on the point of his scalpel, the source of thought; what, I\r\nsay, becomes of all these?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is less wisdom in such vain speculation than in these simple\r\nwords: '_I believe in God the Father, the Creator of all things_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Worlds,\" says Isaiah, \"are, before Him, like the dew-drops on a blade\r\nof grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are now, however, getting into the clouds,\" remarked Wolston; \"let\r\nus return to the earth by the shortest route. What do you mean to do\r\nwith the chimpanzee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we must cage him in some way,\" replied Becker; \"to let him loose\r\nagain would be to create fresh uneasiness for ourselves. To kill him\r\nwould be almost a kind of homicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I come in now?\" inquired Willis, thrusting his head into the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with perfect safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, when Master Ernest begins to spin, he gets into the chapter\r\nof miracles, and forgets that we have ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help seeing them sometimes though, Willis; when they are a\r\nlittle longer than usual, it is difficult to hide them altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Willis, \"I confess I am a bit of a fool, and as you\r\nare at a loss what to do with our friend here, I shall take him over\r\nwith me to Shark's Island: there will be a pair of us there then.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will undertake to be his guide and instructor, he is yours,\r\nWillis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I call him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jocko.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall go hard with me if I do not make a gentleman of him in a\r\nmonth's time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like,\" said Frank, \"if you could convert him into a tiger.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tiger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we want a footman in livery to fetch Mrs. Wolston's carriage\r\nnext time she calls for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel highly flattered by the compliment,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"but\r\nfear you will not be able to turn him out entire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the top boots to come from?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEERS--EXCURSION TO COROMANDEL--HINDOO FANCIES--A CAGED\r\nHUNTER--LOUIS XI. AND CARDINAL BALUE--A FURLONG OF NEWS--CARNAGE--THE\r\nBARONET AND HIS SEVENTEEN TIGERS--FIFTY-FOUR FEET OF CELEBRITY--STERNE'S\r\nWINDOW--PROMENADE OF THE CONSCIENCES--EMULATION AND VANITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a country is released from the presence of an enemy that annoyed\r\nand harassed them, the people feel as if a weight had been taken off\r\ntheir shoulders; so the inhabitants of New Switzerland had breathed\r\nmore freely since the capture of the chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe works at Falcon's Nest were completed, and the two families had\r\ntaken possession of their aerial dwellings, where they were perched\r\nlike a pair of rookeries within call of each other.\r\n\r\nThe confined air of towns has a tendency to plunge men into lethargy\r\nand indolence, and to precipitate the decadence of a constitution in\r\nwhich the seeds of disease have been sown; whilst, on the other hand,\r\nthe pure air of the country braces the nerves, excites a healthy\r\naction in the system, and invigorates a shattered frame; so it was\r\nwith Mr. Wolston--under the benign influences of the genial climate\r\nand the refreshing sea breeze, he gradually, but steadily, recovered\r\nhealth and strength.\r\n\r\nA larger breadth of land had been cleared and fitted for receiving\r\ngrain, which it was susceptible of reproducing a hundred-fold. Such is\r\nthe sublime contract God has made with man, that, in exchange for his\r\nlabor and skill, a single grain of wheat will produce seven or eight\r\nstalks, each bearing an ear containing fifty grains; a single grain\r\nhas been known to yield twenty-eight ears, and Pliny states that Nero\r\nreceived a grain bearing the enormous number of three hundred and\r\nsixty ears. Strange that such a singular instance of fecundity should\r\npresent itself during the domination of a man, or rather monster, who\r\ndared to wish that the Roman people had only one head, so that he\r\nmight cut it off at a single blow!\r\n\r\nWillis and the Wolstons were as yet ignorant of the extent and limits\r\nof the colony; there were two inclosed and cultivated sections, named\r\nrespectively Waldeck and Prospect Hill, which they had not yet\r\ninspected. With a view to enable them to form a more accurate\r\nconception of the boundaries of the territory they inhabited, a grand\r\nexcursion was decided upon that would enable them leisurely to\r\ninvestigate every nook and cranny of the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe storehouse was accordingly overhauled, and the ladies called in to\r\nprepare viands for the journey; they were likewise invited to furnish\r\na supply of certain enchanted travelling bags, in which the gentlemen\r\nwere often astonished to find, during their distant expeditions, a\r\nthousand and one useful things that they would never have dreamt of\r\nbringing with them of their own accord.\r\n\r\nBecker, Wolston, Ernest, and Frank set about the construction of a\r\nvehicle on four wheels for the luggage and the ladies; they did not\r\ncontemplate erecting a machine with elastic springs and gilded panels,\r\nlike the Lord Mayor's state coach--their object was to produce a\r\nmachine that would ease, without dislocating, the limbs of the\r\ntravellers, and that would move at least more gently than a gardener's\r\ncart, loaded with hampers of greens for Covent Garden Market. It may\r\nreadily be supposed that Ernest's Latin was not of much service in\r\nthese operations, for even Wolston's mechanical skill was sorely tried\r\nin elaborating the design.\r\n\r\nFritz, Willis, and Jack had already started as pioneers of the\r\nexpedition to examine the buildings, and to see that no more apes or\r\nother piratical marauders had established themselves on their\r\npremises; and, in compliance with a request made by Willis, who\r\nstrongly objected to becoming a bushranger, they had gone by water. It\r\nwas further arranged that, on their return, all should start\r\ntogether--the entire community in one cavalcade, like an army on the\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies were as much pleased in anticipation with this\r\njourney as if the destination of the travellers had been Brighton or\r\nRamsgate. To children of their age, change is always pleasing. Often,\r\nin consequence of a death, the collapse of a bank, the loss of a\r\nlaw-suit, or some dire disaster of that sort, parents have seen\r\nthemselves compelled to abandon the home of their fathers, endeared to\r\nthem by many gentle recollections, perhaps to embark for some far\r\ndistant land; they stifle their sighs, and bid a mute farewell to each\r\nstone and each tree, familiar to them as household words; they depart\r\nwith reluctance, and often turn to cast a lingering look behind at\r\nobjects so dear to their memory. Not so the children; they issue from\r\nthe door like a flock of caged pigeons just let loose; they sing and\r\nleap and laugh with glee; the old house has no charms for them, they\r\nare as glad to depart as their elders are wishful to stay; the trunk\r\ndesires to multiply its roots on the soil, but the buds prefer to blow\r\nelsewhere--for the latter life resolves itself into the word FUTURE,\r\nand for the former into the word PAST.\r\n\r\nLeaving Wolston, Becker, and his two sons hard at work on the\r\ncarriage, let us turn to the pinnace which was now making its way\r\nalong the shore under the guidance of the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"I should like much,\" said Fritz, \"to present Mr. and Mrs. Wolston\r\nwith a couple of bear, leopard, or tiger skins.\"\r\n\r\n\"So should I,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could think of some other sort of gift,\" suggested Willis;\r\n\"what do you say to a couple of seal or shark skins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't do,\" replied both Fritz and Jack in one voice. \"What objections\r\nhave you to the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are in some sort consigned to my care; I should like you to\r\nreturn to your parents with your own skins entire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think it is a terrific affair to kill a tiger or two? You\r\nhave been accustomed to the sea, and fancy landsmen are good for\r\nnothing but shooting crows and wild-cats; that is a mistake, however;\r\nwe are familiar with larger game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers! do you call bears and tigers game?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, Willis, you are a bit of a milksop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Avast heaving there, Master Fritz! as it is, I am a half-hanged man\r\nalready, so death has now no terrors Dov me; it is the first pang that\r\nis most felt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but in the case of tigers, they never give you time to feel a\r\nsecond pang; miss your aim, and it is all over with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; and therefore I wish you would give up the project. As for\r\nmyself, I would face anything with a four-pounder, but rifle practice\r\non board ship is mostly confined to the marines; it is not that,\r\nhowever, I am troubled about; I am certain your worthy father would\r\nnever forgive me if I countenance this project.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not tell him anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, are the skins to come from? Can you say you bought them\r\nat the furrier's? You must really hit upon some other fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is not a fancy, Willis, it is a necessity; it is not our own\r\namusement we are consulting. Just imagine yourself what will happen\r\nduring the excursion now being arranged. Our parents will, of course,\r\noffer their bear skins to Mr. and Mrs. Wolston; there will be refusals\r\non the one side and entreaties on the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, as is usual in these sort of discussions,\" added Jack, \"Mrs.\r\nWolston will call her carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Fritz, \"and my mother will most certainly deprive\r\nherself of a covering that is absolutely indispensable during the cold\r\nnights of this climate.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is reason in what you say,\" observed Willis, scratching his\r\near.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Willis, the thing ought and must be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you put it, yes; but it will take time to prepare the skins.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not be ready in time for this expedition certainly, and my\r\nmother must do without her skin this journey; but it is our duty to\r\nprevent anything of the sort happening in future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I to consent to this project,\" said Willis, \"there is still\r\nsomething more required.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the tigers and what's-a-names; it is necessary to find the brute\r\nbefore you can get its skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted; there would be a difficulty in the case had we not here\r\nquite handy a magnificent covering of wild animals, all ready to kill\r\nor to be killed. Just steer a point to the east, Willis; there, that\r\nwill do. Just beyond that bluff you see yonder, there is a low flat\r\nplain covered with brushwood and tufted with trees; on the left, this\r\nprairie is bounded by a chain of low hills, and on the right a broad\r\nriver, which last we have named the St. John, because it bears some\r\nresemblance to a stream of that name in Florida; beyond this plain\r\nthere is a swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Jack, \"behind this swamp there is a magnificent forest of\r\ncedars, peopled with the finest furs imaginable, but garnished,\r\nhowever, with formidable claws and rows of teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware,\" said Willis, \"that we were within reach of such\r\namiable neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they cannot reach us; thanks to the conformation of that chain of\r\nhills you see yonder, there is only one pass that opens into our\r\nsettlement, and that we have taken care to shut up and fortify.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears then,\" said Willis, \"that there will be no difficulty in\r\nfinding the animals, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Willis, no more buts; you hunt in your own way from morning\r\ntill night, let us for once hunt in ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go a-hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there you are, charging your piece just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my pipe you mean; but look at the difference; mosquitoes bite\r\nhuman beings, they don't eat them!\"\r\n\r\n\"And, you may add, their skins don't make bed-clothes. Besides, if my\r\nmother takes rheumatism or the ague, it will be you that is to blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather face all the tigers in Bengal and all the lions in\r\nAfrica than incur such a responsibility. I will, therefore, take a\r\npart in your cruise, and if any accident happens to either of you, I\r\nshall stay in the forest till nothing is left of me but my cap and my\r\nbones. In this way I will escape all reproach in this world, and I may\r\nas well, after all, rejoin my old commander, Captain Littlestone, by\r\nthis road as by any other.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, they had reached the coast of Waldeck, and having\r\nlanded, they found the outhouses and sheds that had been erected there\r\nin satisfactory order; the apes had not forgotten a battue that had\r\nonce been got up for their special behoof, as not an individual was to\r\nbe seen in the neighborhood. A morass of the district that had been\r\nconverted into a rice plantation, promised an abundant crop; and the\r\ncotton plants, that Frank had once mistaken for flakes of snow, reared\r\ntheir woolly blossoms, looking for all the world like the powdered\r\nheads of our ancestors. After a slight repast, the pinnace was once\r\nmore in motion, and the party steering for Prospect Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" sighed Willis, \"I wish we had only Sir Marmaduke Travers' cage\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cage!\" cried Fritz, laughing, \"what, to shut up the game first and\r\nshoot it afterwards?\" \"No, quite the reverse: to shut up the hunters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you would serve us in the same way as Louis XI. served Cardinal\r\nBalue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of either Louis XI. or Cardinal Balue; but the cage I\r\nspeak of was an excellent invention, for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which you would like to prove to us by caging ourselves, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Marmaduke Travers,\" continued Willis, \"was an English gentleman,\r\nand he was travelling in Coromandel, no one knew why or for what\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the fun of the thing, probably,\" suggested Jack; the English are\r\nsaid to be great oddities.\"\r\n\r\n\"At that time there happened to be a Hindoo widow somewhere in those\r\nparts. This lady was very rich, very young, very beautiful, and very\r\nfond of tormenting her admirers. And, as fate would have it, the\r\ntravelling Englishman was completely taken captive by this dark\r\nbeauty; and taking advantage of the hold she had obtained upon his\r\nheart, she amused herself by making him do all sorts of out of the way\r\nthings. Sometimes she would bid him let his moustache grow, then she\r\nwould order him to cut it off; he had to worship Brahma, adopt the\r\nfashion of the Hindoos, and had even to undergo the indignity of\r\nhaving his head tied up in a dirty pocket-handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say,\" remarked Jack, \"that the lady, not having a pug or a\r\nmonkey, made Sir Marmaduke a substitute for both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, but still Sir Marmaduke was no fool; he was, on the\r\ncontrary, a gentleman and a philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt that,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, then. You have been brought up in an out of the way\r\npart of the world, and are not familiar with the usages of civilized\r\nsociety. When once a man has allowed the tender passion to take root\r\nin his breast, it cannot afterwards be extinguished at will; it grows\r\nand grows like an oil spot, so that what might easily have been\r\nmastered at first, makes us in time its devoted slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot admit,\" said Fritz, \"that any sensible man would allow\r\nhimself to be treated in the way you state.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wisest and bravest have often, for all that, been obliged to bend\r\ntheir heads to such circumstances; in fact, those only escape whose\r\nhearts have been steeled by time or adversity. Well, nothing would\r\nplease the lady in one of her caprices short of Sir Marmaduke's going\r\nalone to the jungle and killing a tiger or two for her. This caused\r\nhim some little uneasiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" remarked Jack, \"unless he had been accustomed to\r\nface the animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, the widow's hand was to be the reward of the achievement,\r\nand the thing must consequently be done. Being, however, as I have\r\nsaid, a bit of a philosopher, he considered with himself that if, by\r\nchance, he should perish in the attempt he would lose the widow all\r\nthe same, and that he could not think of with any thing like\r\nequanimity. To extricate himself from this dilemma he sent a despatch\r\nto an enterprising friend of his, then stationed with his regiment at\r\nCalcutta, requesting his advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this friend, no doubt, sent him a couple of tigers all ready\r\ntrussed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, better than that; he sent him a strong iron cage fifteen feet\r\nsquare, very solid. This was shipped on board a cutter commanded by\r\nCaptain Littlestone, and I was entrusted with the task of erecting it\r\non shore, whilst an express was sent off to Sir Marmaduke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Jack, \"I begin to understand now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he rigged himself in tiger-hunting costume, went and bade the\r\nlady good-bye, who coolly wished him good sport, mounted a horse, and\r\nrode off to conquer a lady who, as a proof of her affection, had so\r\ncavalierly consigned him to the tender mercies of the wild beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it was dooming him to certain destruction,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the cage had been conveyed to a valley surrounded\r\nwith mountains, the caves of which were known to shelter entire\r\ncolonies of tigers. Here also came Sir Marmaduke. The cage was firmly\r\nembedded in the soil, the exterior was thickly studded over with sharp\r\nspikes screwed into the bars; inside were placed a table and a sofa,\r\nwith crimson velvet cushions.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lady's boudoir in the wilderness,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"In one corner there was a case containing a dozen bottles of pale\r\nale, and as many of champagne; in another was a second case containing\r\ncurry pies and a variety of preserved meats; in a third case were five\r\nand twenty loaded rifles, together with a complete magazine in\r\nminiature of powder and shot. On the table were sundry cases of\r\nhavannahs, a box of _allumettes_, the last number of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, and a copy of the _Times_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the _Times_?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It is a furlong of paper, folded up and covered with news,\r\nadvertisements, and letters from the oldest inhabitant of everywhere.\r\nLeaving, then, Sir Marmaduke seated in the centre of his cage, we\r\ntowards night returned to the cutter, first scattering two or three\r\nquarters of fresh beef in the vicinity of the cage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should have assembled all the tigers in Coromandel,\" said\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, it brought enough. Towards midnight Sir Marmaduke could count\r\nthirty noble brutes capering in the moonlight and feasting upon the\r\nbeef that had been provided for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did the Englishman do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He took aim at the most magnificent specimen of the herd and fired.\r\nNo sooner had he done this than the whole pack came scampering towards\r\nthe cage, thinking, doubtless, they had nothing to do but scrunch the\r\nbones of the solitary hunter. This was the signal for a regular\r\nslaughter. Sir Marmaduke discharged his rifles point blank in the\r\nnoses of the animals that environed him on all sides; those who were\r\nnot wounded by the balls were severely injured by the spikes of the\r\ncage in their furious efforts to seize their enemy. The howling,\r\nyelling, and fury was quite a new sensation for Sir Marmaduke; he\r\nrather enjoyed the thing whilst the excitement lasted. However, all\r\nthings must have an end; when the sun appeared on the horizon the\r\nwounded retired, leaving the dead masters of the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, in the meantime,\" remarked Fritz, \"that the amiable Hindoo\r\nwas considering whether or not, under the circumstances, she should\r\nwear mourning for her defunct cavalier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that as it may, the defunct made his appearance, safe and sound,\r\nthat same day, whilst the cutter stood out to sea with every vestige\r\nof the cage except the dead tigers. Shortly after, the widow was\r\nastonished to see an army of coolies marching in procession towards\r\nher door, all, like the slaves of Aladdin, heavily laden; and she was\r\nnot awakened from her surprise till the master of the ceremonies had\r\nplaced the following letter in her hands:\r\n\r\n\"Madam,--With this you will receive seventeen fall-grown tigers, which\r\nI have had the honour of shooting for you.\r\n\r\n\"Marmaduke Travers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a choice bijou for a lady,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Fritz; \"and if the ladies of Coromandel have stands in\r\ntheir drawing-rooms, to display the tributes to their charms, Sir\r\nMarmaduke's present afforded abundant material for adorning those of\r\nthe widow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the consequence was, that Sir Marmaduke's name rung from one\r\nend of India to the other. The feat of killing, single-handed,\r\nseventeen tigers, converted him into a hero of the first magnitude. No\r\nfestival was complete without him, he was courted by the fashionables\r\nand worshipped by the mob; some enthusiasts even proposed to erect a\r\ntomb for him, that being the way they honor their great men in eastern\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every country,\" remarked Fritz, \"has its own peculiarities in this\r\nrespect. The memory of the illustrious men of Greece and Rome was\r\nperpetuated in the intrinsic merit of the works of art erected in\r\ntheir names. In England quantity takes the place of quality; there is\r\nsaid to be in London a statue of a hero disguised as Achilles, six\r\nyards in height, and perched upon a pedestal twelve yards high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Making in all,\" remarked Jack, \"exactly eighteen yards of fame.\"\r\n\r\n\"The handsome Hindoo,\" continued Willis, \"was proud of the feat her\r\ncharms had inspired. She gloried in showing off the redoubtable\r\ntiger-slayer at her _réunions_, and ended in being completely\r\nfascinated herself with her former slave. The match that she had\r\nformerly sneezed at she now earnestly desired, and, as Sir Marmaduke\r\ndid not declare himself so speedily as she desired, she determined to\r\ngive him a little encouragement by sending one of the most inviting\r\nand most odoriferous of notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Marmaduke must then have considered himself one of the happiest\r\nof men,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Willis, \"neither man nor woman can, in affairs of\r\nthis kind, depend upon themselves for two consecutive hours. The\r\naspirations of a whole life-time may be dispelled in five minutes, and\r\nthe wishes of to-day may become the detestations of to-morrow. The new\r\nsensations awakened in Sir Marmaduke by the affair of the cage--his\r\nrecollection of the ferocious brutes as they clung with expiring\r\nenergy to the bars of the cage, their streaked skins streaming with\r\nblood, the fearful howling and terrific death yells, the formidable\r\nclaws that were often within an inch of his face--had, somehow or\r\nother, chased the passion he had felt for the widow completely out of\r\nhis breast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the scamp of a Travers!\" said Jack, energetically.\r\n\r\n\"He began to ask himself coolly what a lady, who had made such\r\nextraordinary demands upon him before marriage, might not require him\r\nto do after; and the result of his cogitations is expressed in the\r\nfollowing reply that he sent to the now smiling widow:--\r\n\r\n\"'Sir Marmaduke Travers is highly flattered by the charming note of\r\nthe adorable daughter of Brahma; he shall gladly continue to bask in\r\nthe sunshine of her smiles, out his ambition desires and will accept\r\nnothing more.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Flowery and laconic,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" inquired Willis, \"was I not right in wishing to have the cage\r\nof Sir Marmaduke here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but we cannot get it. We have no ingenious trend at Calcutta to\r\nsend us such a machine, and furnish it with crimson-cushioned sofas\r\nand pale ale, so we shall have to rest satisfied with our own\r\ningenuity, tact, and agility.\"\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were justified in relying upon their own resources.\r\nThey had been often sorely tried, and never had been found wanting in\r\ncases of emergency. Since the arrival of the Wolstons their courage\r\nhad become almost temerity; previous to that event, they had been\r\ncontent to meet danger bravely when it was inevitable, and never went\r\ndeliberately in search of it. Now, however, if we apply the glass of\r\nwhich Sterne speaks to their breasts and spy what is passing therein,\r\nwe shall fad that an imperious desire to become heroes had taken\r\npossession of their inward souls--a determination to make themselves\r\nconspicuous at all hazards was burning within them; that, in fact,\r\nthey were courting the admiration of the new audience that Providence\r\nhad sent to the colony, the praise of which found more favor in their\r\nhearts than the paternal admonitions.\r\n\r\nThis was far from being commendable; but, although emulation and\r\nvanity have some features in common, still they must not be\r\nconfounded: the former consists in generous efforts to equal or\r\nsurpass some one in something praiseworthy; the second is a kind of\r\nself-love, that seeks to purchase respect or flattery at no matter\r\nwhat cost;--the one is a vice, the other a virtue.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were not actuated by vanity; they were urged on by\r\ntheir impulses, without weighing the circumstances that gave them\r\nrise; and indeed they were not even conscious of being more desirous\r\nof renown now than they had been hitherto.\r\n\r\nThe temperament of Ernest and Frank was of another kind. Their natures\r\nwere much less excitable, and it did not appear that the recent\r\narrivals had altered their outward demeanor in the slightest degree;\r\nthey continued calm, staid, and reflective, as they had ever been.\r\n\r\nAll four were a singular mixture of the child and the man--knowing\r\nmany things that young people are ignorant of, they were yet almost\r\ntotally unacquainted with the ordinary attributes of social\r\nlife--unsophisticated and naive to an extreme degree, they would have\r\nappeared in a fashionable drawing-room downright fools. On the other\r\nhand, they possessed great clearness of perception, presence of mind\r\nin danger, promptitude in action, and the utmost coolness in the face\r\nof apparently insurmountable obstacles--qualities that would have\r\nutterly confounded the young men who shine in the saloons of Europe,\r\nwhose chief merit often consists in their being familiar with the\r\nunmeaning conventionalisms of fashionable life.\r\n\r\nAt Prospect Hill they found the outhouses and plantations in much the\r\nsame position as at Waldeck. Here the crimson flowers of the caper\r\nplant, the white flowers of the tea plant, and the rich blossoms of\r\nthe clove tree, perfumed the air and promised a fragrant harvest. This\r\nwas a charming caravansary, all ready with its smiles to welcome the\r\nillustrious colonists as soon as they presented themselves.\r\n\r\nThese points being settled to the satisfaction of the three pioneers,\r\na sheep was taken on board the pinnace at the request of Willis--who\r\nseemed to have taken a violent fancy for mutton chops--and they set\r\nsail towards the east.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance they made for a projecting head-land that seemed\r\nto bar their progress in that direction, and, much to the astonishment\r\nof the Pilot, they entered a cavern that formed the entrance to a\r\nnatural tunnel. This, besides being an interesting feature in the\r\ncoast scenery, was one of the treasures of the colony, for it\r\ncontained vast quantities of edible birds' nests, so much prized by\r\nthe Chinese. The voyagers did not, however, tarry here; these were not\r\nthe objects they were now in search of. Nautilus Bay and the Bay of\r\nPearls were likewise traversed unheeded, nor could the attractive\r\nbanks of the St. John, fringed with verdant foliage, divert them from\r\nthe project they had in contemplation.\r\n\r\nWise men, when they indulge in folly, are often more foolish than real\r\nfools; so it was with Willis: now that he had joined in the scheme, he\r\nevinced more ardor in its execution than the young men themselves. He\r\nsaid that it would not be enough to capture skins for Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWolston, they must also capture one a-piece for Mary and Sophia\r\nlikewise, and talked as if the adventure of Sir Marmaduke and his\r\nseventeen tigers had been a bagatelle.\r\n\r\nSome hours before dark they landed at a spot well known to both Fritz\r\nand Jack; it was a place where Becker and his sons had some time\r\nbefore been engaged in deadly conflict with a herd of lions, and where\r\none of their dogs had fallen a victim to the enraged monarchs of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\"My plan,\" said Willis, \"is to kill the sheep and place the quarters\r\non the shore, just as bait is thrown into the water to bring the fish\r\nwithin the net.\"\r\n\r\n\"A reminiscence of Sir Marmaduke,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Willis, \"we shall light a fire to take the place of\r\nthe sun, who is about to retire for the night. This done, I propose\r\nthat we should return to the pinnace, keep the mutton within rifle\r\nrange, and riddle the skins that come to feast upon it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some opposition on the part of Fritz and Jack, who preferred to\r\nencounter their antagonists on more equal terms, the proposal of\r\nWillis was ultimately agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON THE WATCH--FECUNDITY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS--LATEST NEWS FROM THE\r\nMOON--A DEATH-KNELL EVERY SECOND--THE INCONVENIENCES OF BEING TOO NEAR\r\nTHE SUN--NARCOTICS--WILLIS CONTRALTO--HUNTING TURNED UPSIDE\r\nDOWN--ELECTRIC CLOUDS--PARTIALITIES OF LIGHTNING--BELLS AND\r\nBELL-RINGERS--CONDUCTING RODS--THE RETURN--THE TWO SISTERS--TOBY\r\nBECOMES A DRAGOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is usual in tropical climates, a blazing hot day was succeeded by\r\nan intensely dark night. The fire that the hunters had made on shore\r\ncast a lurid glare on the prominent objects round about. The flames,\r\nas they fitfully lit up the landscape into that dim distinctness\r\ntermed by artists the _chiar oscuro_, made the bushes and trunks of\r\ntrees appear like monsters issuing stealthily from the forest that\r\nlined the background. There seemed to be some attraction, however,\r\nelsewhere for the real monsters, not a single wild beast having as yet\r\nappeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nThe two young men were eagerly straining their eyes from the stern of\r\nthe pinnace, whilst the dogs kept diligently wagging their tails in\r\nexpectation of a signal for the onset. The position of Willis could be\r\nascertained now and then by an eye of fire, which opened and shut as\r\nhe inhaled or exhaled the fumes of his Maryland. The ripple beat\r\ngently on the sea-line of the boat, which oscillated with the\r\nregularity and softness of a cradle.\r\n\r\n\"It is always so,\" said Jack, impatiently; \"if we don't want wild\r\nbeasts, there are shoals of them to be seen; but if we do want them,\r\nthen they are all off to their dens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, there are none now,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Say rather,\" observed Fritz, \"that there ought to be thousands; for\r\non the one hand they multiply rapidly, and on the other there is no\r\none to destroy them. Spaniards once left a few cattle on St. Domingo,\r\nand they increased at such a rate, that the island very soon would not\r\nhave been able to support them, had they not been kept down by\r\nconstant slaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" remarked Jack, \"the bovine race reproduce themselves more\r\nslowly than other animals; a single sow, according to a calculation\r\nmade by Vauban, if allowed to live eleven years, would produce six\r\nmillions of pigs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a cargo of legs of pork and sides of bacon!\" exclaimed Willis,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Then fish; there are more than a hundred and sixty thousand eggs in a\r\nsingle carp. A sturgeon contains a million four hundred and\r\nsixty-seven thousand eight hundred and fifty, whilst in some codfish\r\nthe number exceeds nine millions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you need not favor us with the 'Mariner's March,' Willis; what my\r\nbrother says is perfectly correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, do these shoals of creatures live upon?\"\r\n\r\n\"The big ones upon the little ones; fish devour each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful harmony of Nature,\" remarked Fritz drily.\r\n\r\n\"Then plants,\" continued Jack, \"are still more prolific than animals.\r\nSome trees can produce as many of their kind as they have branches, or\r\neven leaves. An elm tree, twelve years old, yields sometimes five\r\nhundred thousand pods; and, by the way, Willis, to encourage you in\r\ncarrying on the war against the mosquitoes, a single stalk of tobacco\r\nproduces four thousand seeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"The leaves, however, are of more use to me than the seeds,\" replied\r\nWillis.\r\n\r\n\"This admirable proportion between the productiveness of the two\r\nkingdoms demonstrates the far-seeing wisdom of Providence. If the\r\npower of multiplication in vegetables had been less considerable, the\r\nfields, gardens, and prairies would have been deserts, with only a\r\nplant here and there to hide the nakedness of the land. Had God\r\npermitted animals to multiply in excess of plants, the entire\r\nvegetation would soon have been devoured, and then the animals\r\nthemselves would of necessity have ceased to exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, then,\" inquired Willis, \"with this continual\r\nmultiplication always going on, the inhabitants of land and sea do not\r\nget over-crowded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as regards man, for example, if thirteen or fourteen human\r\nbeings are born within a given period, death removes ten or eleven\r\nothers; but though this leaves a regular increase, still the\r\npopulation of the globe always continues about the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so, Master Jack, but when I was a little boy at school, I\r\ngenerally came in for a whipping, if I made out two and two to be\r\nanything else than four.\"\r\n\r\n\"And served you right too, Willis; but if the human family did not\r\ncontinually increase, if the number of deaths exceeded continually\r\nthat of the births, at the end of a few centuries the world would be\r\nunpeopled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; but if, on the other hand, there is a continual increase,\r\nhow can the population continue the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the increase supposes a normal state; that is to say, the\r\nbirths are only estimated as compared with deaths from disease or old\r\nage. But then there are shipwrecks, inundations, plagues, and war,\r\nwhich sometimes exterminate entire communities at one fell swoop. Then\r\nwhole nations die out and give place to the redundant populations of\r\nothers; phenomena now observed in the cases of the aborigines of\r\nAustralia and America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true.\"\r\n\r\n\"No signs of furs yet,\" cried Fritz, who was every now and then\r\nlevelling his rifle at the phantoms on shore.\r\n\r\n\"We need not dread,\" continued Jack, \"ever being hustled or jostled on\r\nthe earth; life will fail us before space. There are now eight hundred\r\nmillions of human beings in existence, and, according to the most\r\nmoderate computation, room enough for twice that number. As it is, the\r\nmost fertile sections of the earth are not the most populous; there\r\nare four hundred millions in Asia, sixty millions in Africa, forty in\r\nAmerica, two hundred and thirty in Europe, and only seventy millions\r\nin the islands and continent of Oceanica!\"\r\n\r\n\"To which,\" remarked Fritz, \"you may add the eleven inhabitants of New\r\nSwitzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuming, then, this calculation to be nearly accurate, though\r\nauthorities vary materially in their computations of the earth's\r\ninhabitants, and regarding it in connexion with the average duration\r\nof human life, a thousand millions of mortals must perish in\r\nthirty-three years; to descend to detail, thirty millions every year,\r\nthree thousand four hundred every hour, sixty every minute, or ONE\r\nEVERY SECOND.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" remarked Willis, \"we are here to-day and gone to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose, then, that the population of the earth were twice as great,\r\ncultivation would be extended, territories that are now lying waste\r\nwould be teeming with life and covered with fertile fields, but the\r\nsame beautiful equilibrium would be maintained.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the inhabitants of the planets,\" said Fritz, \"what are they\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"What planets do you mean?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all in general; the moon, for example, in particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon,\" replied Jack, \"has, in the first place, no atmosphere.\r\nThis we know, because the rays of the stars passing behind her are\r\nnot, in the slightest degree, refracted; and this proves that neither\r\nmen, nor animals, nor vegetables of any kind, are to be found in that\r\nplanet, for they could not exist without air.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should settle the question,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" remarked Fritz; \"but some theorists, nevertheless, insist that\r\nthere may be living creatures in the moon, for all that--of course,\r\ndifferently constituted from the inhabitants of our earth, and\r\nsusceptible of existing without air. There is, however, no evidence of\r\nany kind to support such a theory; it is a mere fancy, the dream of an\r\nimaginative brain. Upon the same grounds, it may be argued, that the\r\ninterior of the earth is inhabited, and that elves and gnomes are\r\npossible beings. Besides, the telescope has been brought to so high a\r\ndegree of perfection, that objects the size of a house can now be\r\ndetected in the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, I am afraid,\" remarked Jack, who, like his brother, was\r\ngetting annoyed by the phantasmagoria on shore, \"that we were about\r\nas well supplied with wild beasts here as they are with men in the\r\nplanets.\"\r\n\r\n\"In speaking of the moon, however,\" continued Fritz, \"I do not imply\r\nall the planets; for, certain as we are that the moon has no\r\natmosphere, so we are equally certain that some of the planets possess\r\nthat attribute. Still there are other circumstances that render the\r\nnotion of their being inhabited by beings like ourselves exceedingly\r\nimprobable. Mercury, for example, is so embarrassed by the solar rays,\r\nthat lead must always be in a state of fusion, and water, if not\r\nreduced to a state of vapor, will be hot enough to boil the fish that\r\nare in it. Uranus, at the other extremity of the system, receives four\r\nhundred times less heat and light than we do, consequently neither\r\nwater nor any thing else can exist there in a liquid state; what is\r\nfluid on our earth must be frozen up into a solid mass. Good, I\r\ndeclare my brother has fallen asleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very--interesting--however,\" said Willis, making ineffectual\r\nefforts to smother a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"The same difficulty with comets; there must have been some very\r\nurgent necessity for human beings in order to have peopled them. When\r\nthey pass the perihelion--\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"The point where they approach nearest the sun--when they pass the\r\nperihelion, I was going to say, the heat they endure must be terrific;\r\nwhen on the other hand, at their extreme distance from that body, the\r\ncold must be intense. The comet of 1680 did not approach within five\r\nthousand _myriamètres_ of the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends coming within that distance of each other should at least\r\nshake hands,\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Still, even at that distance, the heat, according to Newton, must be\r\nlike red-hot iron, and if constituted like our earth, when heated to\r\nthat degree, must take fifty thousand years to cool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty thousand years!\" said Willis, yawning from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n\"The central position between these extremes, which would either\r\ncongeal our earth into a mass of ice or burn it up into a heap of\r\ncinders, is therefore the most congenial to such beings as ourselves.\r\nWhence I conclude--\"\r\n\r\nHere the crimson flashes of Willis's pipe, which had been gradually\r\ndiminishing in brilliance suddenly ceased; _contralto_ notes issued\r\nfrom the profundities of his breast, and it became evident to the\r\norator that all his audience were sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Whence I conclude,\" said Fritz, addressing himself, \"that my orations\r\nmust be somewhat soporiferous.\"\r\n\r\nBeing thus left alone to keep a look-out on shore, his thoughts\r\ngradually receded within his own breast, where all was rose-colored\r\nand smiling, for at his age rust has not had time to corrupt, nor\r\nmoths to eat away. And it was not long before he himself, like his two\r\ncompanions, was fast locked in the arms of sleep.\r\n\r\nHow long this state of things lasted the chronicle saith not; but the\r\nthree sleepers were eventually awakened by a simultaneous howl of the\r\ndogs. They were instantly on their feet, with their rifles levelled.\r\n\r\nIt was too late; day had broken, and there was light enough to\r\nconvince them that nothing was to be seen. The sheep's quarters had,\r\nhowever, entirely disappeared, and they had the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that they had politely given the denizens of the forest a\r\nfeast gratis.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, they shall pay us for it yet,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"This is a case of the hunters being caught instead of the game,\"\r\nremarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"The poor sheep! If Ernest had been here, he would have erected a\r\nmonument to its memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt that; epitaphs are generally made rather to please the living\r\nthan to compliment the defunct. But, Willis, we must deprive you of\r\nyour office of huntsman in chief--I shall go into the forest and\r\nrevenge this insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection to abdicate the office of huntsman, but must\r\nretain that of admiral, in which capacity I announce to you that there\r\nwill be a storm presently, and that we shall just have time to make\r\nRockhouse before it overtakes us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is rather a reason for our remaining where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have come for skins, and skins we must have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, we are two to one, and in all constitutional governments the\r\nmajority rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you both made up your minds?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are quite decided.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Willis, \"let us hoist the anchor and be off\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home! but we are determined to have the skins first.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you are not,\" said Willis; \"I know you better than you know\r\nyourselves. You are both brave fellows, but I know you would not, for\r\nall the skins in the world, have your good mother suppose that you\r\nwere buffeted about by the waves in a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; up with the anchor, Willis,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" said Jack, shaking his fist menacingly at the silent\r\nforest, \"but we shall lose nothing by waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor had not erred in his calculations, for they had scarcely\r\nunfurled the sail before they heard the distant rumbling of the storm.\r\nAs soon as the first flash of lightning shot across the sky, Jack put\r\nhis forefinger of one hand on the wrist of the other, and began\r\ncounting one--two--three.\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel feverish?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"No, not personally,\" replied Jack; \"I am feeling the pulse of the\r\nstorm--twenty-four--twenty-five--twenty-six--it is a mile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! how do you make that out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very easily; you recollect Ernest telling us that light travelled so\r\nrapidly, that the time it occupied in passing from one point to\r\nanother of the earth's surface was scarcely perceptible to our\r\nsenses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I thought he was spinning a yarn at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were wrong, Willis; he likewise told us that sound travels at the\r\nrate of four hundred yards in a second.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have patience, Willis! When the lightning flashes, the electric spark\r\nis discharged, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was never high enough aloft to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"But others have been; Newton and Franklin have seen it. Now, if the\r\nsound reaches our ears a second after the flash, it has travelled four\r\nhundred yards. If we hear it twelve or thirteen seconds after, it has\r\ntravelled twelve or thirteen times four hundred yards, or about half a\r\nmile, and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has that to do with your pulse?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I am in perfect health, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then when our systems are in good order, the pulse, keeping fractions\r\nout of view, beats once in every second; and consequently, though we\r\ndo not always carry a watch, we always have our arteries about us, and\r\nmay therefore always reckon time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then we are to escape this time without the 'Mariner's March.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears, Master Jack, that you have turned philosopher as well as\r\nyour brothers. Can you tell me what causes lightning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can, Willis. You must know, in the first place, that all the\r\nlayers of the atmosphere are, more or less, charged with electricity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him how,\" said Fritz drily.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you hope to puzzle me,\" replied Jack, \"but thanks to Mr. Wolston,\r\nI am too well up in physics to be easily driven off my perch, and\r\ntherefore may safely take my turn in philosophising.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are listening.\"\r\n\r\n\"The air, by means of the vapor it contains, absorbs electricity from\r\nterrestrial bodies, and so becomes a sort of reservoir of this\r\ninvisible fluid. All chemical combinations evolve electricity, the air\r\ncollects it and stores it up in the clouds. There, worshipful brother,\r\nyour question is answered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Willis, you must know, in the second place, the clouds are very\r\ngood fellows, and share with each other the good things they possess.\r\nWhen one cloud meets another, the one over-supplied with this fluid\r\nand the other in its normal state, there is an immediate interchange\r\nof courtesies, the negative electricity of the one is exchanged for\r\nthe positive of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"There does not appear, however, to be much generosity in this\r\ntransaction, since the surcharged cloud does not cede its superfluous\r\nabundance without a consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very rarely that philanthropy amongst us goes much further,\"\r\nremarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"No, everybody is not like Willis,\" rejoined Jack, \"who acts like a\r\nprince, and gives legs of mutton gratis to hyenas and tigers. The\r\ndischarges of electricity from one cloud to another are the flashes of\r\nlightning, and it is to be observed that the thunder is nothing more\r\nthan the noise made by the fluid rushing through the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is the thunderbolt?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as what is popularly understood by the term\r\nthunderbolt. The lightning itself, however, often does mischief. This\r\nhappens when the discharge, instead of being between two clouds in the\r\nair, takes place between a cloud and the ground--a cloud surcharged\r\nwith electricity understood. Then all intervening objects are struck\r\nby the fluid.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, however, you are wrong,\" said Fritz. \"All objects are not\r\nstruck; on the contrary, the fluid avoids some things and searches out\r\nothers, even moving in a zig-zag direction to manifest these caprices;\r\nit often discharges itself on or into hard substances, and passes by\r\nthose which are soft or feeble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might say this arose from a sentiment of generosity,\" added Jack,\r\n\"but I have other reasons to assign.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" said Fritz, \"as I should scarcely be satisfied\r\nwith the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Jack, \"lightning has its likings and dislikings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like men and women,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"It has a partiality for metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"An affection that is not returned, however,\" observed Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"If the fluid enters a room, for example, it runs along the bell\r\nwires, inspects the works of the clock, and sometimes has the audacity\r\nto pounce upon the money in your purse, even though a policeman should\r\nhappen to be in the kitchen at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" remarked Willis, \"it is Socialist or Red Republican in its\r\nnotions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not, however, patronise war,\" replied Jack; \"I once heard of\r\nit having melted a sword and left the scabbard intact.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, to say the least of it, is improbable,\" remarked Fritz. \"The\r\nhilt, or even the point, might have been fused; but even supposing the\r\nelectric fluid to have been capable of such flagrant preference, the\r\nscabbard could not have held molten metal without being itself\r\nconsumed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" remarked Willis, \"there are plenty of non-sensical stories of\r\nthat kind in circulation, because nobody takes the trouble to test\r\ntheir truth. Still, according to your own account, a man or woman runs\r\nno danger from the lightning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon there, Willis; the electric fluid does not go out\r\nof its way to attack a human being, but if one should-happen to be in\r\nits way, it does not take time to request that individual to stand\r\naside, it simply passes through him, and leaves him or her, as the\r\ncase may be, a coagulated mass of inanimate tissues.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a variety of ways there are of getting out of the world!\" said\r\nWillis lugubriously.\r\n\r\n\"Again,\" continued Jack, \"anything that happens to be in the vicinity\r\nof the clouds when this interchange of courtesies is going on, is apt\r\nto draw the storm upon itself, hence the continual war that is carried\r\non between the lightning and the steeples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something like an individual coming within range of a cloud of\r\nmosquitoes,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"A learned German--one of us,\" said the scapegrace, laughing,\r\n\"calculated, in 1783, that in the space of thirty-three years there\r\nhad been, to his own knowledge, three hundred and eighty-six spires\r\nstruck, and a hundred and twenty bell-ringers killed by lightning,\r\nwithout reckoning a much larger number wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" remarked Willis, \"I never heard of an insurance against\r\naccidents by lightning.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of them, however, in Roman Catholic countries,\" said\r\nFritz. \"Every village has one, and the charge is almost nominal.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, do these companies make it pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"They find it answer somehow, and they never collapse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then everybody ought to insure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but there are some obstinate people who do not see the good of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my life had not already been forfeited, I should insure it. But\r\nhow is it done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you have only to go into a church, fall down on your knees\r\nbefore the priest, he will make you invulnerable by a sign of the\r\ncross; then, come storms that pulverize the body or crush the mind,\r\nyou are perfectly safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that is the way you insure your lives, is it, trusting to the\r\npriests rather than to Providence? For my own part, I should prefer a\r\npolicy of insurance--that is to say, if my life were of any value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Next to steeples,\" continued Jack, \"come tall trees, such as poplars\r\nand pines. Should you ever be caught by a storm in the open country,\r\nWillis, never take shelter under a tree; face the storm bravely, and\r\nsubmit to be deluged by the rain. Dread even bushes, if they are\r\nisolated. An entire forest is less dangerous than a single reed when\r\nit stands alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget, brother, that when a man stands alone he is quite as\r\nprominent an object as the trunk of a tree four or five feet high,\r\nparticularly in an open plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. It is therefore advisable, when severe storms are close\r\nupon us, to lie down flat on the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" remarked Fritz, smiling, \"a brigade of soldiers on the\r\nmarch suddenly to collapse in this way, as if before a discharge of\r\ngrape.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not? If it is done in the case of grape-shot, why may it not\r\nbe done when the artillery is a thousand times more effective?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suspect it would rather astonish the commanding officer,\r\nthat is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Willis,\" continued Jack, \"you must not run during a storm,\r\nbecause the air you put in motion by so doing may draw the electricity\r\ninto the current.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the conductors not prevent the lightning from doing harm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you cannot carry one of them on your hat. These rods are\r\nonly useful in protecting buildings, and then to nothing more than\r\ndouble the area of their length; it is for this last reason that roofs\r\nof public buildings have them projecting in all directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are a sort of trap set for the lightning, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and into which it is pretty sure to fall. Franklin, of whom I\r\nspoke just now, was the first to suggest that bars of steel would draw\r\nlightning out of a cloud surcharged with electricity.\"\r\n\r\n\"What becomes of it when it is caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeping in view its partiality for bell-pulls, a wire is attached to\r\nthe rod down which the unconscious fluid glides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a powder-monkey from the main-top.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; till it enters a well, and there it is left at the bottom in\r\ncompany with Truth.\"\r\n\r\nA practical storm had begun to mix itself up with the theory as\r\ndeveloped by Jack, but not before they had very nearly reached their\r\ndestination, where they were waited for with the greatest anxiety.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they landed than Sophia ran to meet Willis, who was\r\nadvancing with Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sweetheart,\" she said, \"Susan has been so uneasy about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good girl, Miss Soph--Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you only knew how frightened we have been!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, do you admit fear to be one of your accomplishments, Miss\r\nSophia?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, when others are concerned, Master Jack. But, by the way,\r\ndo you recollect the chimpanzee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what about the rascal?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I must not tell you, mamma would call me a chatterbox; you will\r\nknow by-and-by.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Mary, on her side, was congratulating Toby, who kept\r\nscampering between herself and Fritz, at one moment receiving the\r\ncaresses of the one and at the next of the other, with every\r\ndemonstration of joy. This had become an established mode of\r\ncommunication between the young people when Fritz arrived from a\r\nlengthened ramble; the intelligent, brute, in point of fact, had\r\nassumed the office of dragoman.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah, Becker, glad to see you again,\" said Willis. \"Your sons are\r\nfountains of knowledge, whilst I am--\"\r\n\r\n\"A very worthy fellow, Willis, and I know it,\" replied Becker, shaking\r\nhim heartily by the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMAN PROPOSES, BUT GOD DISPOSES--THE CHOICE OF A\r\nPROFESSION--CONQUEROR--ORATOR--ASTRONOMER--COMPOSER--PAINTER--POET--VILLAGE\r\nCURATE--THE KAFIRS--OCCUPATIONS OF WOMEN--THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF THE\r\nSEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the storm succeeded one of those diluvian showers that have already\r\nbeen described. Rain being merely a result of evaporation, it was\r\nevident that sea and land in those climates must perspire at an\r\nenormous rate to effect such cataclysms. In consequence of this\r\ndeluge, the proposed excursion was indefinitely postponed. The\r\nprovisions, the marvellous kits, the waggon, were all ready; but\r\nNature, as often happens under such circumstances, had assumed a\r\nmenacing attitude, and for the present forbade the execution of the\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nA sort of vague sadness, that generally accompanies a gloomy\r\natmosphere, weighed upon the spirits of the colonists. Recollections\r\nof the _Nelson_ and her sudden disappearance thrust themselves more\r\nvividly than ever upon their memory; and Willis was observed to throw\r\nhis sou'-wester unconsciously on the ground--a proof that remembrances\r\nof the past occupied his thoughts.\r\n\r\nOne of the ladies was occupied in the needful domestic operations of\r\nthe household, whilst the other sat with a stocking on her left arm,\r\nbusily occupied in repairing the ravages of tear and wear upon that\r\nuseful though humble garment. The two young ladies spun, as used to do\r\nthe great ladies of the court of King Alfred, and as Hercules himself\r\nis said to have done when he changed his club and lion's skin for a\r\nspindle and distaff with the Queen of Lybia; Jack was apparently\r\nsketching, Fritz had a collection of hunting apparatus before him, and\r\nthe other two young men, each with a book, were deeply immersed in\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThis state of things was by no means cheerful, and Wolston determined\r\nto break up the monotony by introducing a subject of conversation\r\nlikely to interest them all, the old as well as the young.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, gentlemen,\" said he, \"it occurs to me that you have not\r\nyet thought of selecting a profession; your future career seems at\r\npresent somewhat obscure.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have?\" inquired Jack; \"there is no use for lawyers and\r\njudges in our colony, except to try plundering monkeys or protect\r\njackal orphans.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but suppose you were to find yourselves, by some chance, again\r\nin the great world, there it is necessary to possess a qualification\r\nof some kind; a blacksmith or a carpenter, expert in his handicraft,\r\nhas a better chance of acquiring wealth and position than a man\r\nwithout a profession, however great his talents may be; an idler is a\r\nmere clog in the social machine, and is often thrust aside to browse\r\nin a corner with monks and donkeys.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to acquire a profession, is not instruction and practice\r\nnecessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; it is impossible to become a proficient in any art or\r\nscience by mere study alone; but before sowing a field, what is done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is ploughed and manured.\"\r\n\r\n\"And should there be only a few seeds?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can sow what we have, and reserve the harvest till next season. By\r\neconomising each crop in this way, we shall soon have seeds enough to\r\ncover any extent of land.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I request you, Master Ernest, to draw a conclusion from that as\r\nregards sowing the seeds of a future career?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would infer, from your suggestion, that we might adapt ourselves\r\nfor such and such a profession by preparing our minds to receive\r\ninstruction in it, and we might also avail ourselves in the meantime\r\nof such sources of information regarding it as are at present open to\r\nus. The physician in prospective, for example, might make himself\r\nfamiliar with the medical properties of such plants as are within his\r\nreach; he might likewise examine the bones of an ape, and thus, by\r\nanalogy, become acquainted with the framework of the human body. The\r\nwould-be lawyer might, in the same way, avail himself of the library\r\nto obtain an insight into those social mysteries that bind men in\r\ncommunities and necessitate human laws for the preservation of peace\r\nand order. Thus, by directing our thoughts into one line of study, we\r\nmay form a basis upon which the superstructure may be easily erected,\r\nand the necessary academical degrees or sanction of the university\r\nobtained.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, when you see this, why not adopt so commendable a course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we may probably be destined to remain here, where, according\r\nto Jack, the learned professions, at least, are not likely to be much\r\nin demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The study of a particular science or art has charms in itself, which\r\namply compensate the student for his labor. But, even admitting you do\r\nnot return to the Old World, you forget that it is your intention to\r\ncolonise this territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, however, that God has willed it otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What God does not will in one way, he may bring about in another.\r\nWhat reason have you for supposing that the _Nelson_ may not return\r\nwith colonists?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be from the other world then,\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from the other world,\" replied Jack, \"but not in the sense you\r\nimply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, should the _Nelson_ not reappear, that is no reason why\r\nanother accident may not drive another ship upon the coast that will\r\nbe more fortunate; what has happened to-day may surely happen again\r\nto-morrow. And in the event of colonists arriving, will there not be\r\nsick to cure, boundaries to determine, differences of opinion to\r\ndecide, and opposing claims to adjudge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Wolston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, admitting these necessities, what profession will each of you\r\nselect? Let us begin with you, Master Fritz.\"\r\n\r\n\"The career,\" replied Fritz, \"that would be most congenial to my\r\ntaste is that of a conqueror.\"\r\n\r\n\"A conqueror!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Alexander, Scipio, Timour the Tartar, and Gengis Khan are the\r\nsort of men I should like to resemble. They have made a tolerable\r\nfigure in the world, and I should have no objection to follow in their\r\nfootsteps.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget that their footsteps are marked with tears, disasters,\r\nterror, and bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are indispensable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, when a great commander was asked the same question, he replied,\r\nthat you cannot make omelets without breaking eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" remarked Becker, \"but if you had read the anecdote entire, you\r\nwould have seen that he was asked in return, 'What use there was for\r\nso many omelets.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Added to which,\" continued Wolston, \"that is not a normal career;\r\nthere is no diploma required for it; it is an accident arising out of\r\nadventitious circumstances, sometimes fostered by ambition, but no\r\ncourse of study can produce a conqueror.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is the use of military schools?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are, to the best of my knowledge, instituted for rearing\r\ndefenders for one's country, and not with a view to the subjugation of\r\nanother's.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor Fritz,\" said Mrs. Becker laughing, \"I hope when you conquer\r\nhalf the world, you will find an occupation for your mother more in\r\nconsonance with your dignity than mending your stockings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, again,\" continued Wolston, \"war cannot be waged by a single\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be an enemy somewhere,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"The difficulty does not, however, lie there,\" observed Jack; \"for, if\r\nwe have no enemies, it is easy enough to make them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must, at all events, be armies, magazines, and a treasury--or\r\neggs, as the great commander in question hinted.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Fritz; \"but there is the same difficulty as regards\r\nall professions; there can be no barristers without briefs, no\r\nphysicians without patients.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will admit, however, that clients and patients are not so rare as\r\nhundreds of thousands of armed men and millions of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" said Jack, \"your cavalry are routed and your infantry\r\noutflanked.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are determined to be a conqueror, let it be by the pen rather\r\nthan by the sword--or, what do you say to oratory? It is not easier,\r\nperhaps, but, at all events, eloquence is not denied to ordinary\r\nmortals. You will not then, to be sure, rank with the Hannibals, the\r\nTamerlanes, or the Cæsars; but you may attain a place with\r\nDemosthenes, who was more dreaded by Philip of Macedon than an army of\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Cicero,\" remarked Becker, \"who preserved his country from the\r\nrapacity of Cataline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Peter the Hermit,\" remarked Frank, \"who by his eloquence roused\r\nEurope against the Saracens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Bossuet,\" added Wolston, \"and then you may venture to assert in\r\nthe face of kings that _God alone is Great_, should they, like Louis\r\nXIV., assume the sun as an emblem, and adopt such a silly scroll as\r\n'_Nec pluribus impar_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Bossuet, Peter the Hermit, Cicero, and Demosthenes, are not so bad,\r\nafter all, as a last resource,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"and I would\r\nrecommend you to enrol yourself in that list of conquerors, Master\r\nFritz.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more especially,\" observed Jack, \"as you have no impediment in\r\nyour voice, and would not have to undergo a course of pebbles like\r\nDemosthenes.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as that goes, Jack,\" replied Fritz, \"you would possess a like\r\nadvantage for the profession as myself; but I will take time to\r\nreflect.\" Then, turning towards his mother, he said, \"Conqueror or\r\nJack Pudding, mother, you shall always find me a dutiful son.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother was more gratified by this expression of attachment than\r\nshe would have been had he laid at her feet the four thousand golden\r\nspurs found, in 1302, on the field of Courtray.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Ernest, what profession do you intend to adopt? what is\r\nyour dream of the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, Mr. Wolston! Well, having no taste for artillery, brilliant\r\ncharges, blood-stained ruins, and the other _agrémens_ of war, I\r\ncannot be a hero. Do you know when I feel most happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, let us hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is towards evening, when I am reposing tranquilly on the banks of\r\nthe Jackal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I thought so,\" cried Jack; \"no position so congenial to the true\r\nphilosopher as the horizontal.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the sun,\" continued Ernest, gravely, \"is retiring behind the\r\nforest of cedars that bounds the horizon; when the palms, the mangoes,\r\nand gum trees, mass their verdure in distinct and isolated groups;\r\nwhen nature is making herself heard in a thousand melodious voices;\r\nwhen the hum of the insect is ringing in my ears, and the breeze is\r\ngently murmuring through the foliage; when thousands of birds are\r\nfluttering from grove to grove, sometimes breaking with their wings\r\nthe smooth surface of the river; when the fish, leaping out of their\r\nown element, reflect for an instant from their silvery scales the\r\ndeparting rays of the sun; when the sea, stretching away like a vast\r\nplain of boundless space, loses itself in the distance, then my eyes\r\nand thoughts are sometimes turned upwards towards the azure of the\r\nfirmament, and sometimes towards the objects around me, and I feel as\r\nif my mind were in search of something which has hitherto eluded its\r\ngrasp, but which it is sure of eventually finding. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I assure you, I would not exchange the moss on which I\r\nsat for the greatest throne in Christendom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely you do not call such a poetical exordium a profession?\"\r\nremarked Becker.\r\n\r\n\"It must be admitted,\" said Wolston, \"that the sun and trees have\r\ntheir uses, especially when the one protects us from the other; the\r\nsun, for example, dries up the moisture that falls from the trees, and\r\nthe trees shelter us from the burning rays of the sun. Still, I am at\r\na loss myself to connect these things with a profession in a social\r\npoint of view.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have thought,\" inquired Ernest, \"if you had seen\r\nNewton and Kepler gazing at the sky, before the one had determined the\r\nmovements of the celestial bodies, and the other the laws of\r\ngravitation? What would you have thought of Parmentier passing hours\r\nand days in manipulating a rough-looking bulb, that possessed no kind\r\nof value in the eyes of the vulgar, but which afterwards, as the\r\npotato, became the chief food of two-thirds of the population of\r\nEurope? What would you think of Jenner, with his finger on his brow,\r\nsearching for a means of preserving humanity from the scourge of the\r\nsmall-pox?\"\r\n\r\n\"But these men had an object in view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jenner, yes; but not the other two. They thought, studied,\r\ncontemplated, and reflected, satisfied that one day their thoughts,\r\ncalculations, and reflections would aid in disclosing some mystery of\r\nNature; but it would have perplexed them sorely to have named\r\nbeforehand the nature and scope of their discoveries.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to you, then,\" said Jack, \"there could not be a more\r\ndignified profession than that of the scarecrow. The greatest\r\ndunderhead in Christendom might simply, by going a star-gazing, pass\r\nhimself off as an adept in the occult sciences, and claim the right of\r\nbeing a benefactor of mankind in embryo.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" replied Ernest, \"you will admit that, so long as I am\r\nready to bear my share of the common burdens, and take my part in\r\nproviding for the common wants, and in warding of the common dangers,\r\nit is immaterial whether I occupy my leisure hours in reflection or in\r\nrifle practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jack, \"when you have made some discovery that will enrol\r\nyour name with Descartes, Huygens, Cassini, and such gentlemen, you\r\nwill do us the honor of letting us know.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the greatest pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity that Herschell has invented the telescope: he might have\r\nleft you a chance for the glory of that invention.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have not discovered a new star, brother, I discovered long ago\r\nthat you would never be one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope not; their temperature is too unequal for me--they are\r\neither freezing or boiling: at least, so said Fritz the other day,\r\nwhilst we were--all, what were we doing, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were supposed to be hunting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so we were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Master Jack, it is your turn to enlighten us as to your future\r\ncareer.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite clear, Mr. Wolston, that, since my brothers are to be so\r\nillustrious, I cannot be an ordinary mortal; the honor of the family\r\nis concerned, and must be consulted. I am, therefore, resolved to\r\nbecome either a great composer, like Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; a\r\nrenowned painter, like Titian, Carrache, or Veronese; or a great poet,\r\nlike Homer, Virgil, Shakspeare, Dante, Milton, Goethe, and Racine.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"that you are resolved to be\r\na great something or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly, madam; on reflection, however, as I value my eyesight, I\r\nmust except Homer and Milton.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you not determined to which of the muses you will throw the\r\nhandkerchief?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of music at first. It must be a grand thing, said I to\r\nmyself, that can charm, delight, and draw tears from the eyes of the\r\nmultitude--that can inspire faith, courage, patriotism, devotion and\r\nenergy, and that, too, by means of little black dots with tails,\r\ninterspersed with quavers, crotchets, sharps and flats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you composed a sonata yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam; I was going to do so, but it occurred to me that I should\r\nrequire an orchestra to play it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not having that, you abandoned the idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, madam. I then turned to poetry. That is an art fit for the\r\ngods; it puts you on a level with kings, and makes you in history even\r\nmore illustrious than them. You ascend the capitol, and there you are\r\ncrowned with laurel, like the hero of a hundred fights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the subject of your principal work in this line?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam, I once finished a verse, and was going on with a second,\r\nbut, somehow or other, I could not get the words to rhyme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it occurred to you that you had neither a printer nor readers,\r\nand you broke your lyre?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was about to reproach you, Master Jack,\" said Wolston, \"for\r\nundertaking too many things at once; but I see the ranks are beginning\r\nto thin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful as poetry may be,\" continued Jack, one gets tired of\r\nreading and re-reading one's own effusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is even often intensely insipid the very first time,\" remarked\r\nMrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"There still remains painting,\" continued Jack. \"Painting is vastly\r\nsuperior to either music or poetry. In the first place, it requires no\r\ninterpreter between itself and the public;--what, for example, remains\r\nof a melody after a concert? nothing but the recollection. Poesy may\r\nexcite admiration in the retirement of one's chamber; your nostrils\r\nare, as it were, reposing on the bouquet, though often you have still\r\na difficulty in smelling anything. But if once you give life to\r\ncanvas, it is eternal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eternal is scarcely the proper word,\" remarked Wolston: \"the\r\ncelebrated fresco of Leonardo da Vinci, in the refectory of the\r\nDominicans at Milan, is nothing but a confused mass of colors and\r\nfigures.\"\r\n\r\n\"I answer that by saying that the painting in question is only a\r\nfresco. Besides, I use the word eternal in a modified or relative\r\nsense. A painting is preserved from generation to generation, whilst\r\nits successive races of admirers are mingled with the dust. Then\r\nsuppose a painter in his studio; he cannot look around him without\r\nawakening some memory of the past. He can associate with those he\r\nloves when they are absent, nay, even when they are dead, and they\r\nalways remain young and beautiful as when he first delineated them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" cried Ernest, pushing back his seat, \"if you go on at\r\nthat rate you will take fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that, brother, unless you have a star or a comet in your\r\npocket, in which case you are not far enough away yet.\"\r\n\r\nThese occasional bickerings between Ernest and Jack were always given\r\nand taken in good part, and had only the effect of raising a\r\ngood-humored laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Let the painter,\" he continued, \"fall in with a spot that pleases\r\nhim, he can take it with him and have it always before his eyes. The\r\nhand of God or of man may alter the original, the forest may lose its\r\ntrees, the old castle may be destroyed by fire or time, the green\r\nmeadow may be converted into a dismal swamp, but to him the landscape\r\nalways retains its pristine freshness, the same butterfly still\r\nflutters about the same bush, the same bee still sucks at the same\r\nflower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"it is a pity, after all, that you did\r\nnot achieve your second verse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" continued Jack, \"that is only a copy. How much more sublime\r\nwhen we regard the painter as a creator! If there is in the past or\r\npresent a heroic deed--if there is in the infinity of his life one\r\nmoment more blessed than another, like Pygmalion he breathes into it\r\nthe breath of life, and it becomes imperishable. Who would think a\r\ncentury or two hence of the victories of Fritz, unless the skill of\r\nthe painter be called in to immortalize them!\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you in thinking that the arts you name are the source of\r\nbeautiful and legitimate emotions. But generally it is better to view\r\nthem as a recreation or pastime, rather than a profession. They have\r\ndoubtless made a few men live in posterity, but, on the other hand,\r\nthey have embittered and shortened the lives of thousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never guess what led me to adopt this art in preference to\r\nthe two others. It was the discovery, that we made some years ago, of\r\na gum tree, the name of which I do not recollect.\"\r\n\r\n\"The myrica cerifera,\" said Ernest.\r\n\r\n\"From the gum of this tree the varnish may be made. Now, like my\r\nbrother, who, when he sees the sun overhead, considers he ought to\r\nprofit by the circumstance and become a discoverer, so I said to\r\nmyself: You have varnish, all you want, therefore, to produce a\r\nmagnificent painting is canvas, colors, and talent; consequently, you\r\nmust not allow such an opportunity to pass--it would be unpardonable.\r\nAccordingly, I set to work with an energy never before equalled; and,\"\r\nadded he, showing the design he had just finished, \"here are two eyes\r\nand a nose, that I do not think want expression.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said Mrs. Wolston; \"your painting will be in admirable\r\nkeeping with the hangings my daughters have promised to work for your\r\nmamma.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can deny,\" continued Jack, laughing, \"that the colony is\r\nadvancing in civilization; it already possesses a conqueror, a member\r\nof the Royal Society minus the diploma, and an Apelles in embryo.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is now your turn, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" replied Frank, in his mild but penetrating voice, \"if I may be\r\nallowed to liken the flowers of the garden to the occupations of human\r\nlife, I should prefer the part of the violet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hides itself,\" said Mrs. Wolston, \"but its presence is not the\r\nless felt.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I have allowed myself to indulge in dreams of the future, I have\r\npictured myself dwelling in a modest cottage, partially shrouded in\r\nivy, not very far from the village church. My coat is a little\r\nthreadbare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why threadbare?\" inquired Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Because there are a number of very poor people all round me, and I\r\ncannot make up my mind to lay out money on myself when it is wanted by\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a coat would be sacred in our eyes,\" said Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning I take a walk in my little garden; I inspect the\r\nflowers one after the other; chide my dog, who is not much of a\r\nflorist; then, perhaps, I retire to my study, where I am always ready\r\nto receive those who may require my aid, my advice, or my personal\r\nservices.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Wolston shook Frank very warmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I go amongst the laborers in the fields, talk to them of\r\nthe rain, of the fine weather, and of HIM who gives both. I enter the\r\nhome of the artizan, cheer him in his labors, and interest myself in\r\nthe affairs of his family; I call the children by their names, caress\r\nthem, and make them my friends. I talk to them of our Redeemer, and\r\nthus, in familiarly conversing with the young, I find means of\r\ninstructing the old. They, perhaps, tell me of a sick neighbor; I\r\ndirect my steps there, and endeavor to mitigate the pangs of disease\r\nby words of consolation and hope; I strive to pour balm on the wounded\r\nspirit, and, if the mind has been led away by the temptations of the\r\nworld, I urge repentance as a means of grace. If death should step in,\r\nthen I kneel with those around, and join them in soliciting a place\r\namongst the blessed for the departed soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall all gladly aid you in such labors of love,\" said Mrs.\r\nWolston.\r\n\r\n\"When death has deprived a family of its chief support, then I appeal\r\nto those whom God has blessed with the things of this world for the\r\nmeans of assisting the widow and the fatherless. To one I say, 'You\r\nregret having no children, or bemoan those you have lost; here are\r\nsome that God has sent you.' I say to another, 'You have only one\r\nchild, whilst you have the means of supporting ten; you can at least\r\ncharge yourself with two.' Thus I excite the charity of some and the\r\npity of others, till the bereaved family is provided for. I obtain\r\nwork for those that are desirous of earning an honest living, I bring\r\nback to the fold the sheep that are straying, and rescue those that\r\nare tottering on the brink of infidelity.\"\r\n\r\nHere the girls came forward and volunteered to assist Frank in such\r\nworks of mercy.\r\n\r\n\"I accept your proffered aid, my dear girls, but, as yet, I am only\r\npicturing a future career for myself. After a day devoted to such\r\nlabors as these, I return to my home, perhaps to be welcomed by a\r\nlittle circle of my own, for I hope to be received as a minister of\r\nthe Protestant Church, and, as such, may look forward to a partner in\r\nmy joys and troubles. Should Providence, however, shape my destiny\r\notherwise, I shall have the poor and afflicted--always a numerous\r\nfamily--to bestow my affections upon. But, whilst much of my time is\r\nthus passed amongst the sorrowing and the sick, still there are hours\r\nof gaiety amongst the gloom--there are weddings, christenings, and\r\nmerrymakings--there are happy faces to greet me as well as sad\r\nones--and I am no ascetic. I take part in all the innocent amusements\r\nthat are not inconsistent with my years or the gravity of my\r\nprofession--but you seem sad, Mrs. Wolston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Frank; you have recalled my absent son, Richard, so vividly to\r\nmy memory, that I cannot help shedding a tear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your son in orders then, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is precisely what you have pictured yourself to be, a minister of\r\nthe gospel, and a most exemplary young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" remarked Becker, \"we have hitherto refrained from inquiring\r\nafter your son, madam, it was because we had no wish to recall to your\r\nmind the distance that separated you from him, and we should be glad\r\nto know his history.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is little to relate; he is very young yet, and as soon as he\r\nhad obtained his ordination, he was offered a mission to Oregon, which\r\nhe accepted; but the ship having been detained at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, he regarded the accident as a divine message, to convert the\r\nheathen of Kafraria, where he now is.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no sinecure to live amongst these copper-colored rascals,\" said\r\nWillis; \"they are constantly stealing the cattle of the Dutch settlers\r\nin their neighborhood. About twelve years ago, our ship was stationed\r\nat the Cape, and I was sent with a party of blue jackets into the\r\ninterior, as far as Fort Wiltshire, on the Krieskamma, the most remote\r\npoint of the British possessions in South Africa. There we dispersed a\r\ncloud of them that had been for weeks living upon other people's\r\nproperty. They are tall, wiry fellows, as hardy as a pine tree, and as\r\ndaring as buccaneers. The chief of the _kraals_, or huts, wear leopard\r\nor panther skins, and profess to have the power of causing rain to\r\nfall, besides an endless number of other miraculous attributes.\r\nAmongst them, a wife of the ordinary class costs eight head of cattle,\r\nbut the price of a young lady of the higher ranks runs as high as\r\ntwenty cows. When a Kafir is suspected of a crime, his tongue is\r\ntouched seven times with hot iron, and if it is not burnt he is\r\ndeclared innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" said Jack, \"if they were all subjected to that test,\r\nthey would be found to be a very bad lot. But now, since we have all\r\ndecided upon a profession, let us hear what the young ladies intend\r\ndoing with themselves; let them consult their imagination for a\r\nbeautiful future gilded with sunshine, and embroidered with gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one occupation for women,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"and that\r\nis too well defined to admit of speculation, and too important to\r\nadmit of fanciful embellishments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, mother, let us hear what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to nurse you, and rear you, when you are unable to help\r\nyourselves; to guide your first steps, and teach you to lisp your\r\nfirst syllables. For this purpose, God has given her qualities that\r\nattract sympathy and engender love. She is so constituted as to impart\r\na charm to your lives, to share in your labors, to soothe you when you\r\nare ruffled, to smooth your pillow when you are in pain, and to\r\ncherish you in old age; bestowing upon you, to your last hour, cares\r\nthat no other love could yield. These, gentlemen, are the duties and\r\noccupations of women; and you must admit, that if it is not our\r\nprovince to command armies, or to add new planets to the galaxy of the\r\nfirmament; that if we have not produced an Iliad or an Ænead, a\r\nJerusalem Delivered, or a Paradise Lost, an Oratorio of the Creation,\r\na Transfiguration, or a Laocoon, we have not the less our modest\r\nutility.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so, mother,\" replied Jack; \"it would take no end of\r\nphilosophers to do the work of one of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It surprises me,\" said Willis, \"that not one of you has selected the\r\nfinest profession in the world--that of a sailor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The finest profession of the sea, you mean, Willis. There is no doubt\r\nof its being the finest that can be exercised on the ocean, since it\r\nis the only one. If it is the best, Willis, it is also the worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has also produced great men,\" continued Willis; \"there are\r\nColumbus, Vasco de Gama, and Captain Cook, to whom you are indebted\r\nfor a new world.\"\r\n\r\n\"No thanks to them for that,\" said Jack; \"if they had not discovered a\r\nnew world we should have been in an old one.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not follow,\" remarked Ernest; \"the new world would have\r\nexisted even if it had not been discovered, and you might have found\r\nyour way there all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very likely,\" replied Jack, \"unless one of the stars you intend\r\nto discover had shown us the way; otherwise it would only have existed\r\nin conjecture; and as nobody under such circumstances would have\r\ndreamt of settling in it, they would not have been shipwrecked during\r\nthe voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" remarked Fritz; \"if we had not been here we should, very\r\nprobably, have been somewhere else, and perhaps in a much worse\r\nplight. Let me ask if there is any one here who regrets his present\r\nposition?\"\r\n\r\nWillis was about to reply to this question, but Sophia observing that\r\nthere was something wrong with the handkerchief that he wore round his\r\nneck, hastened towards him to put it to rights, and he was silent.\r\n\r\nThe hour had now arrived when the families separated for the night.\r\nMary was preparing as usual to recite the evening prayer, but before\r\ndoing so she whispered a few words in her mother's ear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my child;\" and, turning to Frank, she added, \"Since you are\r\ndetermined to adopt the ministry as a profession, it is but right that\r\nwe should for the future entrust ourselves to your prayers.\"\r\n\r\nThe two families were now located in their respective eyries; and\r\nJack, whilst escorting the Wolstons to the foot of their tree, said to\r\nSophia,\r\n\r\n\"I thought the chimpanzee had been playing some prank.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he has. Has nobody told you of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will be as discreet as my neighbors; good night, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nHERBERT AND CECILIA--THE LITTLE ANGELS--A CATASTROPHE--THE\r\nDEPARTURE--MARRIAGE OF THE DOGE WITH THE ADRIATIC--SOVEREIGNS OF THE\r\nSEA--DANTE AND BEATRIX--ELEONORA AND TASSO--LAURA AND PETRARCH--THE\r\nRETURN--SURPRISES--WHAT ONE FINDS IN TURBOTS--A HORROR--THE\r\nPRICE OF CRIME--BALLOONING--PHILIPSON AND THE CHOLERA--A\r\nMETAMORPHOSIS--ADVENTURE OF THE CHIMPANZEE--ARE YOU RICH?\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day the sky was shrouded in dense masses of cloud, some grey as\r\nlead, some livid as copper, and some black as ink. Towards evening the\r\ntwo families, as usual, resolved themselves into a talking party, and\r\nWolston, requesting them to listen, began as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"There were two rich merchants in Bristol, between whom a very close\r\nintimacy had for a long time existed. One of them, whom I shall call\r\nHenry Foster, had a daughter; and the other, Nicholas Philipson, had a\r\nson, and the two fathers had destined these children for one another.\r\nThe boy was a little older than the girl, and their tastes, habits,\r\nand dispositions seemed to fit them admirably for each other, and so\r\nto ratify the decision of the parents. Little Herbert and Cecilia were\r\nalmost constantly together. They had a purse in common, into which\r\nthey put all the pieces of bright gold they received as presents on\r\nbirthdays and other festive occasions. In summer, when the two\r\nfamilies retired to a retreat that one of them had in the country, the\r\nchildren were permitted to visit the cottagers, and to assist the\r\ndistressed, if they chose, out of their own funds--a permission which\r\nthey availed themselves of so liberally that they were called by the\r\ncountry people the two little angels.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity there are no poor people here!\" said Sophia, dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" inquired her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Because we might assist them, mamma.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is much better, however, as it is, my child; our assistance might\r\nmitigate the evils of poverty, but might not be sufficient to remove\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThis reasoning did not seem conclusive to Sophia, who shook her head\r\nand commenced plying her wheel with redoubled energy.\r\n\r\n\"When Herbert Philipson was twelve years of age he was sent off to\r\nschool, and Cecilia was confided to the care of a governess, who,\r\nunder the direction of Mrs. Foster, was to undertake her education.\r\nBut neither music nor drawing, needlework, grammars nor exercises,\r\ncould make little Cecilia forget her absent companion. Absence, that\r\ncools older friendships, had a contrary effect on her heart; the\r\nmonths, weeks, days, and hours that were to elapse before Herbert\r\nreturned for the holidays, were counted and recounted. When that\r\nperiod--so anxiously desired--at length arrived, there was no end of\r\nrejoicing: she told Herbert of all the little boys and little girls\r\nshe had clothed and fed, of the old people she had relieved, of the\r\ntears she had shed over tales of woe and misery, how she had carried\r\nevery week a little basket covered with a white napkin to widow\r\nRobson, how often she had gone into the damp and dismal cottage of the\r\ndying miner, and how happy she always made his wife and their nine\r\npitiful looking children.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a way of conquering human hearts,\" remarked Mrs. Becker,\r\n\"often more effective than those referred to the other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, when Herbert was at home for the holidays, he accompanied\r\nCecilia on her charitable visits, and was greatly surprised to find\r\nthat blessings were showered upon his own head wherever they went;\r\npeople, whom he had never seen before, insisted upon his being their\r\nbenefactor. This he could not make out. At last, by an accident, he\r\ndiscovered the secret--Cecilia had been distributing her gifts in his\r\nname! He remonstrated warmly against this, declaring that he had no\r\nwish to be praised and blessed for doing things that he had no hand\r\nin. Finding that his protestations were of no avail, he determined,\r\non the eve of his returning to school, to have his revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not buy Cecilia a doll, did he?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No; he collected all the eatables, clothing, blankets, and money he\r\ncould obtain; went amongst the poorest of the cottages, and\r\ndistributed the whole in Cecilia's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" remarked Mrs. Becker, \"it is a pity we could not all remain at\r\nthe age of these children, with the same purity, the same innocence,\r\nand the same freshness of sensation; the world would then be a\r\nveritable Paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\"For some years this state of things continued, the affection between\r\nthe young people strengthened as they grew older, the occasional\r\nholiday time was always the happiest of their lives. Herbert, in due\r\ncourse, was transferred from school to college, where he obtained a\r\ndegree, and rapidly verged into manhood. Cecilia from the girl at\r\nlength bloomed into the young lady. A day was finally fixed when they\r\nwere to be bound together by the holy ties of the church; everything\r\nwas prepared for their union, when the commercial world was startled\r\nby the announcement that Philipson was a ruined man. A ship in which\r\nhe had embarked a valuable freight had been wrecked, and an agent to\r\nwhom he had entrusted a large sum of money had suddenly disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"How deplorable!\" cried Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Not so very unfortunate, after all,\" remarked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because nothing had occurred to interrupt the marriage; only one of\r\nthe families was ruined, and there was still enough left for both.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Fritz, \"even admitting that the friendship between the two\r\nfamilies continued uninterrupted, and that the father of Cecilia was\r\nwilling to share his property with the father of Herbert, still the\r\nyoung man, in the parlance of society, was a beggar; and it is always\r\nhard for a man to owe his position to a woman, and to become, as it\r\nwere, the _protégé_ of her whom he ought rather to protect.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is the view you take, Master Fritz, then I agree with you\r\nthat the misfortune was deplorable,\" said Mary, bending at the same\r\ntime to hide her blushes, under pretence of mending a broken thread.\r\n\r\n\"And what if Cecilia's father had been ruined instead of Herbert's?\"\r\ninquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I should say,\" replied Sophia, \"that we have as much right to be\r\nproud and dignified as you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best way in such a case,\" observed Willis, laughing, \"would be\r\nfor both parties to get ruined together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Herbert,\" continued Wolston, \"was a youth of resolution and energy.\r\nHe entertained the same opinion as Fritz; and instead of wasting his\r\ntime in idle despondency, got together some articles of merchandise,\r\nand sailed for the Indian Archipelago, promising his friends that he\r\nwould return to his native land in two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years is a long time,\" remarked Mary; \"but sometimes it passes\r\naway very quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" observed Sophia, Cecilia, in the meantime, would redouble her\r\ncharities and her prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two years passed away, then a third, and then a fourth, but not a\r\nsingle word had either been heard of or from the absentee. Cecilia was\r\nrich, and her hand was sought by many wealthy suitors, but hitherto\r\nshe had rejected them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dear, good Cecilia,\" cried Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Up till this period the family had permitted her to have her own way.\r\nBut as it is necessary for authority to prevent excesses of all kinds,\r\nthey thought it time now to interfere; they could not allow her to\r\nsacrifice her whole life for a shadow. Her parents, therefore,\r\ninsisted upon her making a choice of one or other of the suitors for\r\nher hand. She requested grace for one year more, which was granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back, truant, quick; come back, Master Herbert!\" cried Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"There now, Willis,\" cried Jack, \"you see the effect of your new\r\nworld; people go away there, and never come back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you must bring him back in time, father; you must indeed,\"\r\nurged Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"If it were only a romance I were relating to you, Sophia, I could\r\nvery easily bring him back; but the narrative I am giving you is a\r\nmatter of fact, which I cannot alter at will. There would be no\r\ndifficulty in bringing a richly-laden East Indiaman, commanded by\r\nCaptain Philipson, into the Severn, and making Herbert and Cecilia\r\nconclude the story in each other's arms, but it would not be true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if I had been Cecilia, I should have become a nun,\" said Mary,\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\"Exaggeration, my daughter, is an enemy to truth. It is easy to say,\r\n'I would become a nun,' and in Roman Catholic countries it is quite as\r\neasy to become one; but, though it may be sublime to retire in this\r\nway from the world, it is frightful when a woman has afterwards to\r\nregret the inconsiderate step she has taken, and which is often the\r\ncase with these poor creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you said of myself,\" remarked Willis, \"it is a crime to go down\r\nwith a sinking ship so long as there is a straw to cling to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume,\" continued Wolston, \"that during this year poor Cecilia\r\nprayed fervently for the return of her old playfellow; but her prayers\r\nwere all in vain, the year expired, and still no news of the young\r\nman; at last she despaired of ever seeing him again, and, after a\r\nsevere struggle with herself, she decided upon complying with the\r\ndesire of her parents and her friends. A few months after the expiring\r\nof the year of grace, she was the affianced bride of a highly\r\nrespectable, well-to-do, middle-aged gentleman. John Lindsey, her\r\nintended husband, could not boast of his good looks; he was little,\r\nrather stout, was deeply pitted in the face with the small-pox, and\r\nhad a very red nose, but he was considered by the ladies of Bristol as\r\na very good match for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cecilia, how ridiculous!\" exclaimed Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Better, at all events, than turning nun,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"The family this season had gone to pass the summer at the sea-coast;\r\nand one day that Cecilia and her intended were taking their accustomed\r\nwalk along the shore--\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa!\" cried Jack, \"the truant is going to appear, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Lindsey, observing a ring of some value upon Cecilia's finger,\r\npolitely asked her if she had any objections to tell him its history.\r\nShe replied that she had none, and told him it was a gift of young\r\nPhilipson's. 'I am well acquainted with your story,' said Lindsey,\r\n'and do not blame the constancy with which you have treasured the\r\nmemory of that young man; on the contrary, I respect you for it--in\r\nfact, it was the knowledge of your self-sacrifice to this affection\r\nand all its attendant circumstances, that led me to solicit the honor\r\nof your hand; for, said I to myself, one who has evinced so much\r\ndevotion for a mere sentiment, is never likely to prove unfaithful to\r\nsacred vows pledged at the altar,' 'Come what may, you may at least\r\nrely upon that, sir,' she answered. 'Then,' continued Lindsey, 'as an\r\neternal barrier is about to be placed between yourself and your past\r\naffections, perhaps you will pardon my desire to separate you, as much\r\nas possible, from everything that is likely to recal them to your\r\nmind.' Saying that, he gently drew the ring from her finger, and threw\r\nit into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt was strongly suspected that Mary shed a tear at this point of the\r\nrecital.\r\n\r\n\"It is all over with you now, Herbert,\" cried Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"You had better make a bonfire of your ships, like Fernando Cortez in\r\nMexico; or, if you are on your way home, better pray for a hurricane\r\nto swallow you up, than have all your bright hopes dashed to atoms,\r\nwhen you arrive in port.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only a little girl,\" said Sophia; \"but I know what I should have\r\nsaid, if the gentleman had done the same thing to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would you have said, child?\" inquired her mother.\r\n\r\n\"I should have said, that I was not the Doge of Venice, and had no\r\nintention of marrying the British Channel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you describe the ceremony to which you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but it would interrupt papa's story, and Jack would laugh at\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind my story,\" replied her father, \"there is plenty of time\r\nto finish that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as for me,\" said Jack, \"though I do not wear a cocked hat and\r\nknee breeches, and though, in other respects, my tailor has rather\r\nneglected my outward man, still I know what is due to a lady and a\r\nqueen.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, he begins already!\" said Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind him, child; go on with your account of the marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" began Sophia, \"for a long time, there had been disputes\r\nbetween the states of Bologna, Ancona, and Venice, as to which\r\npossessed the sovereignty of the Adriatic.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it had been a dispute about the Sovereignty of the ocean in\r\ngeneral,\" remarked Willis, \"there would have been another competitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Venice,\" continued Sophia, \"carried the day, and about 1275 or 76 she\r\nresolved to celebrate her victory by an annual ceremony. For this\r\npurpose, a magnificent galley was built, encrusted with gold, silver,\r\nand precious stones. This floating _bijou_ was called the\r\n_Bucentaure_, was guarded in the arsenal, whence it was removed on the\r\neve of the Ascension. Next day the Doge, the patriarch, and the\r\nCouncil of Ten embarked, and the galley was towed out to the open sea,\r\nbut not far from the shore. There, in the presence of the foreign\r\nambassadors, whilst the clergy chanted the marriage service, the Doge\r\nadvanced majestically to the front of the galley, and there formally\r\nwedded the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have done worse,\" observed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"The ceremony,\" continued Sophia, \"consisted in the Doge throwing a\r\nring into the sea, saying, 'We wed thee, O sea! to mark the real and\r\nperpetual dominion we possess over thee.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And it may be added,\" observed Becker, \"that the history of Venice\r\nshows how religiously the spouses of the Adriatic kept their vows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Sophia, \"that I have told my tale, let us hear what became\r\nof Cecilia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the marriage took place the morning after Herbert's ring had\r\nbeen thrown to the fishes. Whilst the bride, bridegroom, and their\r\nfriends were congratulating each other over the wedding breakfast, as\r\nis usual in England on such occasions, Cecilia's father was called out\r\nof the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" remarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert Philipson had arrived that same morning; but, as Fritz\r\nobserves, he was just an hour too late. He had acquired a fortune, but\r\nhis long-cherished hopes of happiness were completely blasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he stay away five years without writing?\" inquired Mrs.\r\nWolston.\r\n\r\n\"He had written several times, but at that time no regular post had\r\nbeen established, and his letters had never reached their\r\ndestination.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did he find out that Cecilia was married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, some people think it more humane to kill a man by inches rather\r\nthan by a single blow of the axe. Not so with Herbert's friends; the\r\nfirst news that greeted him on landing were, that his ever-remembered\r\nCecilia was probably at that moment before the altar pledging her vows\r\nto another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather have had a chimney-pot tumble on my head,\" remarked\r\nWillis.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert was a man in every sense of the word--the mode of his\r\ndeparture proves that. On hearing this painful intelligence, he simply\r\ncovered his face with his hands, and, after a moment's thought,\r\nresolved to see his lost bride at least once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Herbert!\" sighed Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Foster was thunderstruck when the stranger declared himself to be the\r\nson of his old friend; and, after cordially bidding him welcome,\r\nsorrowfully asked him what he meant to do. 'I should wish to see Mrs.\r\nLindsey in presence of her husband,' he replied, 'providing you have\r\nno objections to introduce me to the company.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" ejaculated Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Foster could not refuse this favor to an unfortunate, who had just\r\nbeen disinherited of his dearest hopes. He, therefore, took Herbert by\r\nthe hand and led him into the room. Nobody recognized him. 'Ladies and\r\ngentlemen,' said he, 'permit me to introduce Mr. Herbert Philipson,\r\nwho has just arrived from Sumatra.' You may readily conceive the\r\ndismay this unexpected announcement called up into the countenances of\r\nthe guests. There was only one person in the room who was calm,\r\ntranquil, and unmoved--that person was Cecilia herself. She rose\r\ncourteously, bade him welcome, hoped he was well, coolly asked him why\r\nhe had not written to his friends, and politely asked him to take a\r\nseat beside herself and husband, just, for all the world, as if he had\r\nbeen some country cousin or poor relation to whom she wished to show a\r\nlittle attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather have been at the bottom of the sea than in her place,\r\nfor all that,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Why? She had nothing to reproach herself with. Had she not waited\r\nlong enough for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Young heads,\" remarked Becker, \"are not always stored with sense. A\r\nfoolish pledge, given in a moment of thoughtlessness is often\r\nobstinately adhered to in spite of reason and argument. The young idea\r\ndelights in miraculous instances of fidelity. What more charming to a\r\nyoung and ardent mind than the loves of Dante and Beatrix, of Eleonora\r\nand Tasso, of Petrarch and Laura, of Abelard and Heloise, or of Dean\r\nSwift and Stella? Young people do not reflect that most of these\r\nstories are apocryphal, and that the men who figure in them sought to\r\nadd to their renown the prestige of originality; they put on a passion\r\nas ordinary mortals put on a new dress, they yielded to imagination\r\nand not to the law of the heart, and almost all of them paid by a life\r\nof wretchedness the penalty of their dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, I presume,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"you do not object to any\r\nreasonable amount of constancy, but you object to its being carried to\r\nan unwarrantable excess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, madam,\" replied Becker; \"constancy, like every thing else\r\nwhen reasonable limits are exceeded, becomes a vice.\"\r\n\r\n\"The merriments of the marriage breakfast,\" continued Wolston\r\n\"slightly interrupted by the arrival of the new guest, were resumed.\r\nFresh dishes were brought in, and, amongst others, a fine turbot was\r\nplaced on the table. The gentleman who was engaged in carving the\r\nturbot struck the fish-knife against a hard substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what!\" exclaimed two or three voices.\r\n\r\n\"I rather think not,\" said Wolston, drily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, the ring! the ring!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it was merely the bone that runs from the head to the tail of the\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father,\" cried Sophia, \"how can you tease us so?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they had found the ring,\" replied Wolston, laughing, \"I should\r\nhave no motive for concealing it. Fruit was afterwards placed before\r\nHerbert, and, when nobody was looking, he pulled a clasped dagger out\r\nof his pocket.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sophia pressed her hands closely on her ears, in order to avoid\r\nhearing what followed.\r\n\r\n\"It was a very beautiful poignard,\" continued Wolston, \"and rather a\r\nbijou than a weapon; and, as the servants had neglected to hand him a\r\nfruit-knife, he made use of it in paring an apple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it all over?\" inquired Sophia, removing a hand from one ear.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! yes!\" said Jack, lugubriously, \"he has been and done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O the monster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Travelling carriages having arrived at the door for the bridal party,\r\nHerbert quietly departed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Sophia, \"did they not arrest and drag him to\r\nprison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Jack, \"the crime was not so atrocious as it appears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not atrocious!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you must bear in mind that young Philipson had passed the\r\npreceding five years of his life amongst demi-savages, whose manners\r\nand customs he had, to a certain extent, necessarily contracted. In\r\nsome countries, what we call crimes are only regarded as peccadillos.\r\nIn France, for example, till very lately, there existed what was\r\ncalled the law of _combette_, by right of which pardon might be\r\nobtained for any misdeed on payment of a certain sum of money. There\r\nwas a fixed price for every imaginable crime. A man might\r\nconsequently be a Blue Beard if he liked, it was only necessary to\r\nconsult the tariff in the first instance, and see to what extent his\r\nmeans would enable him to indulge his fancy for horrors.\"\r\n\r\n\"On quitting the house,\" continued Wolston, \"Herbert Philipson bent\r\nhis way to the shore, and shortly after was observed to plunge into\r\nthe sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" exclaimed Sophia; \"it saved his friends a more\r\ndreadful spectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weather being fine and the water warm, Herbert enjoyed his bath\r\nimmensely; he then returned to his hotel, went early to bed, and slept\r\nsoundly till next morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wretch!\" cried Sophia, \"to sleep soundly after assassinating his\r\nold playfellow, who had suffered so much on his account.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is pretty certain,\" continued Wolston, \"that, if Philipson had\r\nbeen left entirely to himself, he would always have shown the same\r\ndegree of moderation he had hitherto displayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, moderation!\" said Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"But his friends began to prate to him about the shameful way he had\r\nbeen jilted by Cecilia, and, by constantly reiterating the same thing,\r\nthey at last succeeded in persuading him that he was an ill-used man.\r\nHis self-esteem being roused by this silly chatter, he began to affect\r\na ridiculous desolation, and to perpetrate all manner of outrageous\r\nextravagances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad friends,\" remarked Willis, \"are like sinking ships; they drag you\r\ndown to their own level.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first absurd thing he did was to purchase a yacht, and when a\r\nstorm arose that forced the hardy fishermen to take shelter in port,\r\nhe went out to sea, and it is quite a miracle that he escaped\r\ndrowning. Then, if there were a doubtful scheme afloat, he was sure to\r\ntake shares in it. Nothing delighted him more than to go up in a\r\nballoon; he would have gladly swung himself on the car outside if the\r\nproprietor had allowed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often seen balloons in the air,\" remarked Willis, \"but I could\r\nnever make out their dead reckoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"A balloon,\" replied Ernest, \"is nothing more than an artificial\r\ncloud, and its power of ascension depends upon the volume of air it\r\ndisplaces.\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Master Ernest, so far as the balloon itself is concerned;\r\nbut then there is the weight of the car, passengers, provisions, and\r\napparatus to account for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hydrogen gas, used in the inflation of balloons, is forty times\r\nlighter than air. If a balloon is made large enough, the weight of the\r\ncar and all that it contains, added to that of the gas, will fall\r\nconsiderably short of the weight of the air displaced by the machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it rises in the air just as an empty bottle well corked\r\nrises in the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very nearly. Air is lighter than water; consequently, any vessel\r\nfilled with the one will rise to the surface of the other. So in the\r\ncase of balloons. The gas, in the first place, must be inclosed in an\r\nenvelope through which it cannot escape. Silk prepared with\r\nIndia-rubber is the material usually employed. As the balloon rises,\r\nthe gas in the interior distends, because the air becomes lighter the\r\nless it is condensed by its superincumbent masses; hence it is\r\nrequisite to leave a margin for this increase in the volume of the\r\ngas, otherwise the balloon would burst in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a balloon were allowed to ascend without hindrance where would it\r\nstop?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would continue ascending till it reached a layer of air as light\r\nas the gas; beyond that point it could not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the voyagers do not wish to go quite so far?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is a valve by which the gas may be allowed to escape, till\r\nthe weight of the machine and its volume of air are equal, when it\r\nceases to ascend. If a little more is permitted to escape, the balloon\r\ndescends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And should it land on the roof of a house or the top of a tree, the\r\nvoyagers have their necks broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"That can only happen to bunglers; there is not the least necessity\r\nfor landing where danger is to be apprehended. When the aeronaut is\r\nnear the ground, and sees that the spot is unfavorable for\r\ndebarkation, he drops a little ballast, the balloon mounts, and he\r\ncomes down again somewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fellow that made the first voyage must have been very daring.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first ascent was made by Montgolfier in 1782, and he was followed\r\nby Rosiers and d'Arlandes.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your permission, father,\" said Ernest, \"I will claim priority in\r\naerial travelling for Icarus, Doedalus, and Phaeton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; you are justified in doing so. Gay-Lussac, a philosophic\r\nFrenchman, rose, in 1804, to the height of seven thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have felt a little giddy,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the functions of the body were affected, more or less, by the\r\nextreme rarity of the air at that height. Its dryness caused wet\r\nparchment to crisp. He observed that the action of the magnetic needle\r\ndiminished as he ascended, sounds gradually ceased to reach his ear,\r\nand the wind itself ceased to be felt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, of course,\" remarked Ernest, \"was when he was travelling in the\r\nsame direction and at the same speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jack, \"we can find materials here for a balloon; the\r\nladies have silk dresses, there is plenty of India-rubber--we used to\r\nmake boots and shoes of it; hydrogen gas can be obtained from a\r\nvariety of substances. What, then, is to prevent us paying a visit to\r\nsome of Ernest's friends in the skies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately for your project, Jack, no one has discovered the art\r\nof guiding a balloon; consequently, instead of finding yourself at\r\n_Cassiope_, you might land at _Sirius_, where your reception would be\r\nsomewhat cool.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what became of Herbert?\" inquired one of the ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Singularly enough, he escaped all the dangers he so recklessly\r\nbraved, and all the bad speculations he embarked in turned out good.\r\nSomehow or other, the moment he took part in a desperate scheme it\r\nbecame profitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Sophia, \"his victim, like a guardian angel, continued\r\nto watch over him.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the cholera appeared in England, he was sure to be found where\r\nthe cases were most numerous. He followed up the pest with so much\r\npertinacity and publicity, that it was no unusual thing to find it\r\nannounced in the newspapers that Philipson and the cholera had arrived\r\nin such and such a town.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bane and the antidote,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"If Cecilia had been one of those women who delight in horse-racing,\r\nfox-hunting, opera-boxes, and public executions, she would have been\r\nhighly amused to see her old friend's name constantly turning up under\r\nsuch extraordinary circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she not dead, then?\" inquired Sophia, with astonishment,\r\n\r\n\"It appears that her wounds were not mortal,\" quietly replied her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" observed Jack, \"there are human frames so constituted that\r\nthey can bear an immense amount of cutting and slashing. So in the\r\ncase of animals; there, for instance, is the fresh-water polypus--if\r\nyou cut this creature lengthwise straight through the middle, a right\r\nside will grow on the one half and a left side on the other, so that\r\nthere will be two polypi instead of one. The same thing occurs if you\r\ncut one through the middle crosswise, a head grows on the one half and\r\na tail on the other, so that you have two entire polypi either way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may add,\" observed Ernest, \"since so interesting a subject is\r\non the _tapis_, that if two of these polypi happen to quarrel over\r\ntheir prey, the largest generally swallows the smallest, in order to\r\nget it out of the way; and the latter, with the exception of being a\r\nlittle cramped for space, is not in the slightest degree injured by\r\nthe operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does that state of matters continue any length of time?\"\r\n\r\n\"The polypus that is inside the other may probably get tired of\r\nconfinement, in which case it makes its exit by the same route it\r\nentered; but, if too lazy to do that, it makes a hole in the body of\r\nits antagonist and gets out that way. But, what is most curious of\r\nall, these processes do not appear to put either of the creatures to\r\nthe slightest inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite at a loss to make you all out,\" said Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my child,\" replied her mother, \"you should not close up your\r\nears in the middle of a story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cecilia, or rather Mrs. Lindsey, however,\" continued Wolston, \"was a\r\npious, painstaking, simple-minded woman, who devoted her whole\r\nattention to her domestic duties. Notwithstanding her fortune, she did\r\nnot neglect the humblest affairs of the household, and thought only of\r\nmaking her husband pleased with his home. When she was told of the\r\nvagaries of Philipson, she prayed in private that he might be led from\r\nhis evil ways, and could not help thanking Providence that she was not\r\nthe wife of such a dreadful scapegrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" remarked Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"At last, Herbert Philipson astonished even his own companions by a\r\ncrowning act of folly. There was then a young woman in Bristol, of\r\ngood parentage, but an unmitigated virago; her family were thoroughly\r\nashamed of her temper and her exploits. They allowed her to have her\r\nown way, simply for fear that, through contradiction, she might plunge\r\nherself into even worse courses than those she now habitually\r\nfollowed. In short, she was the talk and jest of the whole town.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a charming creature!\" remarked Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"No servant of her own sex could put up with her for two days\r\ntogether; she styled everybody that came near her fools and asses, and\r\ndid not hesitate to strike them if they ventured to contradict her.\r\nShe got on, however, tolerably well with ostlers, stable-boys, cabmen,\r\nand such like, because they could treat her in her own style, and were\r\nnot ruffled by her abuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"How amiable!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert heard of this young person, and, through a fast friend of his\r\nown, obtained an introduction to her, and on the very first interview\r\nhe offered her his hand. He was known still to be a wealthy man, so\r\nneither the lady herself nor anybody connected with her made the\r\nslightest objection to the match, thinking probably that, if there\r\nwere six of the one, there were at least half a dozen of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ought to have gone to Bedlam, instead of to church,\" said\r\nWillis; \"that is my idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, they went to church; and, after the marriage, Cecilia\r\nsought and obtained an introduction to the lady, and, whether by\r\nentreaties or by her good example, I cannot say; be this as it may,\r\nthe unpromising personage in question became one of the best wives and\r\nthe best mothers that ever graced a domestic circle--in this respect\r\neven excelling the pattern Cecilia herself; and, what is still more to\r\nthe purpose, she succeeded in completely reforming her husband. When I\r\nleft England there was not a more prosperous merchant, nor a more\r\nestimable man in the whole city of Bristol, than Herbert Philipson.\"\r\n\r\n\"From which we may conclude,\" remarked Mrs. Becker, \"it is always\r\nadvisable to have angels for friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may also conclude,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"that when a stroke of\r\nadversity, or any other misfortune, overturns the edifice of happiness\r\nwe had erected for the future, we may build a new structure with fresh\r\nmaterial, which may prove more durable than the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of having angels for friends,\" said Becker, \"puts me in mind\r\nof the association of Saint Louis Gonzaga, at Rome. On the anniversary\r\nof this saint, the young and merry phalanx forming the association\r\nmarch in procession to one of the public gardens. In the centre of\r\nthis garden a magnificent altar has been previously erected, on which\r\nis placed a chafing-dish filled with burning coals. The procession\r\nforms itself into an immense ring round the altar, broken here and\r\nthere by a band of music. These bands play hymns in honor of the\r\nsaints, and other _morceaux_ of a sacred character. Each member of the\r\nassociation holds a letter inclosed in an embossed and highly\r\nornamented envelope, bound round with gay-colored ribbons and threads\r\nof gold. These letters are messages from the young correspondents to\r\ntheir friends in heaven, and are addressed to 'Il Santo Giovane Luigi\r\nGonzaga, in Paradiso.' At a given signal, the letters, in the midst of\r\nprofound silence, are placed on the chafing-dish. This done, the music\r\nresounds on all sides, and the assembly burst out into loud\r\nacclamations, during which the letters are supposed to be carried up\r\ninto heaven by the angels.\"\r\n\r\n\"A curious and interesting ceremony,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"and one\r\nthat may possibly do good, inasmuch as it may induce the young people\r\ncomposing the association to persevere in generous resolutions.\"\r\n\r\nThe two families again separated for the night. And whilst the young\r\nmen were escorting the Wolstons to their tree, Sophia went towards\r\nJack. \"Will you tell me,\" inquired she, \"what happened whilst I had my\r\nears closed up, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with all my heart, if you will tell me first what the chimpanzee\r\nhad been about during our absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he got up into our tree when we were out of the way. After\r\nsoaping his chin, he had taken one of papa's razors, and just as he\r\nwas beginning to shave himself, some one entered and caught him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that all? What I have to tell you is a great deal more\r\nappalling than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, be quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am afraid you will be shocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it very dreadful?\"\r\n\r\n\"More so than you would imagine. If you dream about it during the\r\nnight, you will not be angry with me for telling you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will be courageous, and am prepared to hear the worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was your father saying when you shut up your ears?\"\r\n\r\n\"Herbert had just pulled out a dagger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you took your hands away?\"\r\n\r\n\"All was then over; Herbert had done some dreadful thing with the\r\ndagger, and I want to know what it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"He pared an apple with it,\" replied Jack, bursting into a roar of\r\nlaughter, and, running off, he left Sophia to her reflections.\r\n\r\nA few seconds after he returned. This time he had almost a solemn air,\r\nthe laughter had vanished from his visage, like breath from polished\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Sophia,\" inquired he gravely, \"are you rich?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Master Jack; are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have not the slightest idea either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE TEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND RAIN OF THE TROPICS--CHARLES'S\r\nWAIN--VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENT--A LIKENESS GUARANTEED--THE WORLD AT\r\nPEACE--ALAS, POOR MARY!--THE SAME BREATH FOR TWO BEINGS--THE FIRST\r\nPILLOW--THE LOGIC OF THE HEART--HOW FRITZ SUPPORTED GRIEF--A GRAIN OF\r\nSAND AND THE HIMALAYA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak next morning, all the eyes in the colony were busily\r\nengaged in scrutinizing the sky. This time the operation seemed\r\nsatisfactory, for immediately afterwards, all the hands were, with\r\nequal diligence, occupied in packing up and making other preparations\r\nfor the meditated excursion to the remote dependencies of New\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nThe dense veil that the day before had shrouded them in gloom was now\r\nbroken up into shreds. The azure depths beyond had assumed the\r\nappearance of a blue tunic bespattered with white, and the clouds\r\nsuggested the idea of a celestial shepherd, driving myriads of sheep\r\nto the pasture. Children alone can dry up their tears with the\r\nrapidity of Nature in the tropics; perhaps we may have already made\r\nthe remark, and must, therefore, beg pardon for repeating the simile a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the two families were assembled on the lawn, in front\r\nof the domestic trees of Falcon's Nest, ready to start on their\r\njourney. The cow and the buffalo were yoked to the carriage, which was\r\nsnugly covered over with a tarpauling, thrown across circular girds,\r\nlike the old-fashioned waggons of country carriers. Frank mounted the\r\nbox in front; Mrs. Becker, Wolston, and Sophia got inside; whilst\r\nErnest and Jack, mounted on ostriches that had been trained and broken\r\nin as riding horses, took up a position on each side, where the doors\r\nof the vehicle ought to have been. These dispositions made, after a\r\nfew lashes from the whip, this party started off at a brisk rate in\r\nthe direction of Waldeck.\r\n\r\nIt had been previously arranged that one half of the expedition should\r\ngo by land, and the other half by water, and that on their return this\r\norder should be reversed, so that both the interior and the coast\r\nmight be inspected at one and the same time. The only exception was\r\nmade in favor of Willis, who was permitted both to go and return by\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe second party, consisting of Mrs. Wolston, Becker, Mary, and Fritz,\r\nstarted on foot in the direction of the coast. They had not gone far\r\nbefore Becker observed a large broadside plastered on a tree.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nNobody could give a satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Mrs. Wolston, \"paper grows ready made on the\r\ntrees of this wonderful country.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all approached, and, much to their astonishment, read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"TAKE NOTICE.\r\n\r\n\"The renowned Professor Ernest Becker is about to enlighten the\r\nbenighted inhabitants of this country, by giving a course of lectures\r\non optics. The agonizing doubts that have hitherto enveloped\r\nastronomical science, particularly as regards the interiors of the\r\nmoon and the stars, have arisen from the absurd practice of looking at\r\nthem during the night. These doubts are about to be removed for ever\r\nby the aforesaid professor, as he intends to exhibit the luminaries in\r\nquestion in open day. He will also place Charles's Wain[C] at the\r\ndisposal of any one who is desirous of taking a drive in the Milky\r\nWay. The learned professor will likewise stand for an indefinite\r\nperiod on his head; and whilst in this position will clearly\r\ndemonstrate the rotundity of the earth, and the tendency of heavy\r\nbodies to the centre of gravity. In order that the prices of admission\r\nmay be in accordance with the intrinsic value of the lectures, nothing\r\nwill be charged for the boxes, the entrance to the pit will be gratis,\r\nand the gallery will be thrown open for the free entry of the people.\r\nThe audience will be expected to assume a horizontal position. Persons\r\ngiven to snoring are invited to stay at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think I should know that style,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity Ernest is not with us,\" observed Fritz; \"but the placard\r\nwill keep for a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say laughing is good for digestion,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston; \"and\r\nif so, it must be confessed that Master Jack is a useful member of the\r\ncolony in a sanitary point of view.\"\r\n\r\nThe party had scarcely advanced a hundred paces farther, when Fritz\r\ncalled out,\r\n\r\n\"Holloa! there is another broadside in sight.\"\r\n\r\nThis one was headed by a smart conflict between two ferocious looking\r\nhussars, and was couched in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\"All the inhabitants of this colony capable of bearing arms, who are\r\npanting after glory, are invited to the Fig Tree, at Falcon's Nest,\r\nthere to enrol themselves in the registry of Fritz Becker, who is\r\nabout to undertake the conquest of the world. Nobody is compelled to\r\nvolunteer, but those who hold back will be reckoned contumacious, and\r\nwill be taken into custody, and kept on raw coffee till such time as\r\nthey evince a serious desire to enlist. There will be no objection to\r\nrecruits returning home at the end of the war, if they come out of it\r\nalive. Neither will there be any objections to the survivors bringing\r\nback a marshal's baton, if they can get one. The Commander-in-chief\r\nwill charge himself with the fruits of the victory. Surgical\r\noperations will be performed at his cost, and cork legs will be served\r\nout with the rations. In the event of a profitable campaign, a\r\nmonument will be erected to the memory of the defunct, by way of a\r\nreward for their heroism on the field of battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Fritz,\" said Becker, with a merry twinkle in his eye, \"you were\r\nsorry that Ernest was not present to hear the last placard read;\r\nfortunately, you are on the spot yourself this time.\"\r\n\r\nFritz tried to look amused, but the attempt was a decided failure.\r\n\r\nWhen the party had gone a little farther, another announcement met\r\ntheir gaze; all were curious to know whose turn was come now; as they\r\napproached, the following interesting question, in large letters,\r\nstared them in the face:--\r\n\r\n\"HAVE YOU HAD YOUR PORTRAIT TAKEN YET?\r\n\r\n\"It has been reserved for the present age, and for this prolific\r\nterritory, so exuberant in cabbages, turnips, and other potables, to\r\nproduce the greatest of living artists--real genius--who is destined\r\nto outshine all the Michel Angelos and Rubenses of former ages. Not\r\nthat these men were entirely devoid of talent, but because they could\r\ndo nothing without their palette and their paint brushes. Now that\r\nillustrious _maestro_, Mr. Jack Becker, has both genius and ingenuity,\r\nfor he has succeeded in dispensing with the aforementioned troublesome\r\nauxiliaries of his art. His plan which has the advantage of not being\r\npatented, consists in placing his subject before a mirror, where he is\r\npermitted to stay till the portrait takes root in the glass. By this\r\nnovel method the original and the copy will be subject alike to the\r\nravages of time, so that no one, on seeing a portrait, will be liable\r\nto mistake the grand-mother for the grand-daughter. Likenesses\r\nguaranteed. Payments, under all circumstances, to be made in advance.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well,\" said Becker, laughing, \"it appears that the scapegrace has\r\nnot spared himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope there is not a fourth proclamation,\" said Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"There are no more trees on our route, at all events,\" replied\r\nBecker.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to hear that; Jack must respect the avocation chosen by Frank,\r\nsince he sees nothing in it to ridicule.\"\r\n\r\nAs they drew near the Jackal River, in which the pinnace was moored,\r\nMary and Fritz were a little in advance of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Are you really determined to turn the world upside down, Master\r\nFritz?\"\r\n\r\n\"At present, Miss Wolston, I am myself the sum and substance of my\r\narmy, in addition to which I have not yet quite made up my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an odd fancy to entertain to say the least of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it displease you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In order that it could do that, I must first have the right to judge\r\nyour projects.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I gave you that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should find the responsibility too great to accept it. Besides, a\r\ndetermination cannot be properly judged, without putting one's self in\r\nthe position of the person that makes it. You imagine happiness\r\nconsists in witnessing the shock of armies, whilst I fancy enjoyment\r\nto consist in the calm tranquility of one's home. You see our views of\r\nfelicity are widely different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very widely different as you seem to think, Miss Wolston. As\r\nyet my victories are _nil_; I have not yet come to an issue with my\r\nallies; to put my troops on the peace establishment I have only to\r\ndisembody myself, and I disembody myself accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Mary, \"you are very easily turned from your purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily! no, Miss Wolston, not easily; you cannot admit that an\r\nobjection urged by yourself is a matter of no moment, or one that can\r\nbe slighted with impunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! here we are at the end of our journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Already! the road has never appeared so short to me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wolston, coming up to her daughter, \"you appear\r\nvery merry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not without reason, mamma; I have just restored peace to the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was soon launched, and, under the guidance of Willis, was\r\nmaking way in the direction of Waldeck. The sea had not yet recovered\r\nfrom the effects of the recent storm; it was still, to use an\r\nexpression of Willis, \"a trifle ugly.\" Occasionally the waves would\r\ncatch the frail craft amidships, and make it lurch in an uncomfortable\r\nfashion, especially as regarded the ladies, which obliged Willis to\r\nkeep closer in shore than was quite to his taste. The briny element\r\nstill bore traces of its recent rage, just as anger lingers on the\r\nhuman face, even after it has quitted the heart.\r\n\r\nWhilst the pinnace was in the midst of a series of irregular\r\ngyrations, a shrill scream suddenly rent the air, and at the same\r\ninstant Fritz and Willis leaped overboard.\r\n\r\n_Mary had fallen into the sea_.\r\n\r\nBecker strained every nerve to stay the boat. Mrs. Wolston fell on her\r\nknees with outstretched hands, but, though in the attitude of prayer,\r\nnot a word escaped her pallid lips.\r\n\r\nThe two men floated for a moment over the spot where the poor girl had\r\nsunk; suddenly Fritz disappeared, his keen eye had been of service\r\nhere, for it enabled him to descry the object sought. In a few seconds\r\nhe rose to the surface with Mary's inanimate body in his left arm.\r\nWillis hastened to assist him in bearing the precious burden to the\r\nboat, and Becker's powerful arms drew it on deck.\r\n\r\nThe joy that all naturally would have felt when this was accomplished\r\nhad no time to enter their breasts, for they saw that the body evinced\r\nno signs of life, and a fear that the vital spark had already fled\r\ncaused every frame to shudder. They felt that not a moment was to be\r\nlost; the resources of the boat were hastily put in requisition;\r\nmattresses, sheets, blankets, and dry clothes were strewn upon the\r\ndeck. Mrs. Wolston had altogether lost her presence of mind, and could\r\ndo nothing but press the dripping form of her daughter to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Friction must be tried instantly,\" cried Becker; \"here, take this\r\nflannel and rub her body smartly with it--particularly her breast and\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wolston instinctively followed these directions.\r\n\r\n\"It is of importance to warm her feet,\" continued Becker; \"but,\r\nunfortunately, we have no means on board to make a fire.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wolston, in her trepidation, began breathing upon them.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" said the Pilot, \"that persons rescued from drowning\r\nare held up by the feet to allow the water to run out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Willis; a sure means of killing them outright. It is not\r\nfrom water that any danger is to be apprehended, but from want of air,\r\nor, rather, the power of respiration. What we have to do is to try and\r\nrevive this power by such means as are within our reach.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot, meantime, endeavored to introduce a few drops of brandy\r\nbetween the lips of the patient. Fritz stood trembling like an aspen\r\nleaf and deadly pale; he regarded these operations as if his own life\r\nwere at stake, and not the patient's.\r\n\r\n\"There remains only one other course to adopt, Mrs. Wolston,\" said\r\nBecker, \"you must endeavor to bring your daughter to life by means of\r\nyour own breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only tell me what to do, Mr. Becker, and, if every drop of blood in\r\nmy body is wanted, all is at your disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must apply your mouth to that of your daughter, and, whilst her\r\nnostrils are compressed, breathe at intervals into her breast, and so\r\nimitate the act of natural respiration.\"\r\n\r\nStronger lungs than those of a woman might have been urgent under such\r\ncircumstances, but maternal love supplied what was wanting in physical\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot had turned the prow of the pinnace towards home; he felt\r\nthat, in the present case at least, the comforts of the land were\r\npreferable to the charms of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"This time it is not my breath, but her own,\" said Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Her pulse beats,\" said Becker; \"she lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Fritz and Willis in one voice.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour had scarcely yet elapsed since the patient's\r\nfirst immersion in the sea; but this brief interval had been an age of\r\nagony to them all. As yet, her head lay quiescent on her mother's\r\nbosom, that first pillow, common alike to rich and poor, at the\r\nthreshold of life.\r\n\r\nThe%signs of returning animation gradually became more and more\r\nevident; at length, the patient gently raised her head, and glanced\r\nvacantly from one object to another; then, her eyes were turned upon\r\nherself, and finally rested upon Fritz and Willis, who still bore\r\nobvious traces of their recent struggle with the waves. Here she\r\nseemed to become conscious, for her body trembled, as if some terrible\r\nthought had crossed her mind. After this paroxysm had passed, she\r\nfeebly inclined her head, as if to say--\"I understand--you have saved\r\nmy life--I thank you.\" Then, like those jets of flame that are no\r\nsooner alight than they are extinguished, she again became insensible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the shore, Fritz hastened to Rockhouse, and\r\nmade up a sort of palanquin of such materials as were at hand, into\r\nwhich Mary was placed, and thus was conveyed, with all possible care\r\nand speed, on the shoulders of the men to Falcon's Nest. A few hours\r\nafterwards she returned to consciousness and found herself in a warm\r\nbed, surrounded with all the comforts that maternal anxiety and\r\nBecker's intelligent mind could suggest.\r\n\r\nFritz was unceasing in his exertions; no amount of fatigue seemed to\r\nwear him out. As soon as he saw that everything had been done for the\r\ninvalid that their united skill could accomplish, he bridled an\r\nuntrained ostrich, and rode or rather flew off in search of the land\r\nportion of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Mary is saved,\" he cried, as he came up with them.\r\n\r\n\"From what?\" inquired Wolston, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"From the sea, that was about to swallow her up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Willis, myself, and us all.\"\r\n\r\nThe same evening, the two families were again assembled at Falcon's\r\nNest, and thus, for a second time, the long talked-of expedition was\r\nbrought to an abrupt conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Willis, \"we must cast anchor for a bit; yesterday it was\r\nthe sky, to-day it was the sea, to-morrow it will be the land,\r\nperhaps--the wind is clearly against us.\"\r\n\r\nHow often does it not happen, in our pilgrimage through life, that we\r\nhave the wind against us? We make a resolute determination, we set out\r\non our journey, but the object we seek recedes as we advance; it is no\r\nuse going any farther--the wind is against us. We re-commence ten,\r\ntwenty, a hundred times, but the result is invariably the same. How is\r\nthis? No one can tell. What are the obstacles? It is difficult to say.\r\nPerhaps, we meet with a friend who detains us; perhaps, a recollection\r\nthat our memory has called, induces us to swerve from the path--the\r\nblind man that sung under our window may have something to do with\r\nit--perhaps, it was merely a fly, less than nothing.\r\n\r\nIt is not our minor undertakings, but rather our most important\r\nenterprises, that are frustrated by such trifles as these; for it must\r\nbe allowed that we strive less tenaciously against an obstacle that\r\ndebars us from a pleasure, than against one that separates us from a\r\nduty--in the one case we have to stem the torrent, in the other we\r\nsail with the current.\r\n\r\nWhen we observe some deplorable instance of a wrecked career--when we\r\nsee a man starting in life with the most brilliant prospects\r\ncollapsing into a dead-weight on his fellows, we are apt to suppose\r\nthat some insurmountable barrier must have crossed his path--some\r\nHimalaya, or formidable wall, like that which does not now separate\r\nChina from Tartary; but no such thing. Trace the cause to its source,\r\nand what think you is invariably found? A grain of sand; the\r\nunfortunate wretch has had the wind against him--nothing more.\r\n\r\nRescued from the sea, Mary Wolston was now a prey to a raging fever.\r\nIll or well, at her age there is no medium, either exuberant health or\r\ncomplete prostration; the juices then are turbulent and the blood is\r\nardent.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other, a good action attaches the doer to the recipient;\r\nso, in the case of Fritz, apart from the brotherly affection which he\r\nhad vaguely vowed to entertain for the two young girls that had so\r\nunexpectedly appeared amongst them, he now regarded the life of Mary\r\nas identical with his own, and felt that her death would inevitably\r\nshorten his own existence; \"for,\" said he to himself, \"should she die,\r\nI was too late in drawing her out of the water.\" In his tribulation\r\nand irreflection, he drew no line between the present and the past,\r\nbut simply concluded, that if he saved her too late, he did not save\r\nher at all. Hope, nevertheless, did not altogether abandon him. He\r\nwould sometimes fancy her restored to her wonted health, abounding in\r\nlife and vigour. Then the pleasing thought would cross his mind that,\r\nbut for himself, that charming being, in all probability, would have\r\nbeen a tenant of the tomb. Would that those who do evil only knew the\r\ndelight that sometimes wells up in the breasts of those who do good!\r\n\r\nThe first day of Mary's illness, Fritz bore up manfully. On the\r\nsecond, he joined his father and brothers in their field labors; but,\r\nwhilst driving some nails into a fence, he had so effectually fixed\r\nhimself to a stake that it was only with some difficulty that he could\r\nbe detached. The third day, at sunrise, he called Mary's dog,\r\nshouldered his rifle, and was about to quit the house.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere! Well, I am rather partial to that sort of place; I will go\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must do something that will divert my thoughts. There may be\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well I can help you to look up a difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nEvery day the two brothers departed at sunrise, and returned together\r\nagain in the evening. Mrs. Becker felt acutely their sufferings. She\r\nwatched anxiously for the return of the two wanderers, and generally\r\nwent a little way to meet them when they appeared in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"She does not run to meet us,\" said Fritz, one day; \"that is a bad\r\nsign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" replied Jack. \"If she had any bad news to give us,\r\nshe would not come at all.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] The constellation known in astronomy as the _Great Bear_ is in,\r\nsome parts of England termed the _Plough_, and in others _Charles's\r\nWain_ or _Waggon_.

JULIUS CÆSAR AND POPE GREGORY XIII.--HOW THE DAY AFTER\r\nTHE 4TH OF OCTOBER WAS THE 15TH--OLYMPIAD--LUSTRES--THE HEGIRA--A\r\nHORSE MADE CONSUL--JACK'S DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome men, when they regard the sinister side of events, are apt to\r\ncall in question the axiom, Nothing is accomplished without the will\r\nof God. Why, they ask, do the wicked triumph? Why are the just\r\noppressed? Why this evil? What is the use of that disaster? Was it\r\nnecessary that Mary Wolston should be thrown into the sea, and that\r\nshe should afterwards die in consequence of the accident?\r\n\r\nTo these questions we reply, that God does not interrupt the ordinary\r\ncourse of His works. Man is a free agent in so far as regards his own\r\nactions; were it otherwise, we should not be responsible for our own\r\ncrimes. We might as well plunge into vice as adhere to virtue; for we\r\ncould not be called upon to expiate the one, nor could we hope to be\r\nrewarded for the other. It is not to be expected that God is to\r\nperform miracles at every instant for our individual benefit. It is\r\nunreasonable in us to suppose that, in obedience to our wishes or\r\ndesires, He will alter His immutable laws.\r\n\r\nA foot slips on the brink of a precipice, and we are dashed to atoms.\r\nOur boat is upset in a squall, and we are drowned. Like Stanislaus\r\nLeszinsky, King of Poland, we fall asleep in the corner of a chimney,\r\nour clothes take fire, and we are burned to death. We go a hunting; we\r\nmistake a grey overcoat for the fur of a deer, and we kill our friend\r\nor his gamekeeper, as once happened to the son of Louis XV., who in\r\nconsequence almost died of grief, and renounced forever a sport of\r\nwhich he was passionately fond. Did Providence will, exact, or\r\npre-ordain all these calamities? Certainly not; but our Creator has\r\nseen fit to tolerate and permit them, since he did not interpose to\r\nprevent them.\r\n\r\nThe government of God is a conception so wonderful, so sublime, that\r\nnone but Himself can fathom its depths. Human intelligence is too\r\nfinite to penetrate or comprehend a system so complex, and yet so\r\nuniform. The mind of man can only form a just idea of a cause when the\r\neffect has been made manifest to his understanding. There might have\r\nbeen a reason for the death of Mary Wolston--who knows? But if it were\r\nso, that reason was beyond the pale of mortal ken.\r\n\r\nLet us not, however, anticipate. Mary Wolston is not yet dead. On the\r\ncontrary, when the ninth day of her illness had passed, Fritz and Jack\r\nwere returning from an expedition, the nature of which was only known\r\nto themselves, but which, to judge from the packs that they bore on\r\ntheir backs, had been tolerably productive. The two young men observed\r\ntheir mother advancing, as usual, to meet them, but this time _she\r\nran_. They had no need to be told in words that Mary Wolston was now\r\nout of danger; the serenity of their mother's countenance was more\r\neloquent than the most elaborate discourse that ever stirred human\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Becker herself felt that words were superfluous, so she quietly\r\ntook her son's arm, and they walked gently homewards, whilst Jack\r\nstrode on before. On turning a corner of the road, the latter stumbled\r\nupon Wolston and Ernest, who, in the exuberance of their joy, had also\r\ncome out to meet the hunters. They were, however, a little behind; but\r\nthat was nothing new. These two members of the colony had become quite\r\nremarkable for procrastination and absence of mind. When Wolston the\r\nmechanician, and Ernest the philosopher, travelled in company, it was\r\nrare that some pebble or plant, or question in physics, did not induce\r\nthem to deviate from their route or tarry on their way. One day they\r\nboth started for Rockhouse to fetch provisions for the family dinner,\r\nbut instead of bringing back the needful supplies of beef and mutton,\r\nthey returned in great glee with the solution of an intricate problem\r\nin geometry. All fared very indifferently on that occasion, and, in\r\nconsequence, Wolston and Ernest were, from that time on, deprived of\r\nthe office of purveyors.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, instead of running like Mrs. Becker, they had\r\nphilosophically seated themselves on the trunk of a tree. At their\r\nfeet was a diagram that Wolston had traced with the end of his stick;\r\nthis was neither a tangent nor a triangle, as might have been\r\nexpected, but a figure denoting how to carve one's way to a position,\r\namidst the rugged defiles of life.\r\n\r\n\"In all things,\" observed Wolston, \"in morals as well as physics, the\r\nshortest road from one point to another, is the straight line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" objected Ernest, \"the straight line were encumbered with\r\nobstacles, that would require more time to surmount than to go round.\r\nTwo leagues of clear road would be better than one only a single\r\nleague in length, if intersected by ditches and strewn with wild\r\nbeasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" cried Jack, who had just come up out of breath, \"you might leap\r\nthe one and shoot the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your argument,\" replied Wolston, \"is that of the savage, who can\r\nimagine no obstacles that are not solid and tangible. The obstacles\r\nthat retard our progress in life neither display yawning chasms nor\r\nrows of teeth; they dwell within our own minds--they are versatility,\r\ndisgust, ennui, thirst after the unknown, and love of change. These\r\nlead us to take bye-paths and long turnings, and fritter away the\r\nstrength that should be used in promoting a single aim. Hence arise a\r\nmultiplicity of hermaphrodite avocations and desultory studies, that\r\nterminate in nothing but vexation of spirit. Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that Peter has made up his mind to be a lawyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see any particular reason why Peter should not be a lawyer,\"\r\nsaid Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I either; but unfortunately when Peter has pored a certain time\r\nover Coke upon Littleton, and other abstruse legal authorities, he\r\naccidentally witnesses a review; he throws down his books, and\r\nresolves to become a soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the manner and style of our Fritz,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"He changes the Pandects for Polybius, and Gray's Inn for a military\r\nschool. All goes well for awhile; the idea of uniform helps him over\r\nthe rudiments of fortification and the platoon exercise. He passes two\r\nexaminations creditably, but breaks down at the third, in consequence\r\nof which he throws away his sword in disgust. He does not like now to\r\nrejoin his old companions in the Inn, who have been working steadily\r\nduring the years he has lost. He therefore, perhaps, adopts a middle\r\ncourse, and gets himself enrolled in the society of solicitors, which\r\ndoes not exact a very elaborate diploma.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, after all, the difference between a barrister and a solicitor\r\nis not so great.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but the exercises to which he has been accustomed previously\r\nunfit him for the drudgeries of his new employment, and he soon\r\nabandons that, just as he abandoned the other two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your friend Peter is somewhat difficult to please,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"He then goes into business, a term which may mean a great deal or\r\nnothing at all; it admits of one's going about idle with the\r\nappearance of being fully occupied. Then a few unsuccessful\r\nspeculations bring him back, at the end of his days, to the point\r\nwhence he started--that is, zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, I see now,\" cried Jack, whilst he traced a diagram on the\r\nground. \"Poor Peter has always stopped in the middle of each\r\nprofession and gone back to the starting point of another, thus\r\npassing his life in making zig-zags, and only moving from one zero to\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" added Wolston: \"whilst those who persevered in following up\r\nthe profession they chose at first finally succeeded in attaining a\r\nposition, and that simply by adhering to a straight line.\"\r\n\r\nHere Fritz and his mother arrived, arm in arm.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! there you are,\" cried Ernest. \"We were on our way to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely do not call sitting down there being on your way to meet\r\nus, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, mother,\" suggested Jack, \"on the principle that two bodies\r\ncoming into contact meet each other.\"\r\n\r\nLike those flowers that droop during a storm, but recover their\r\nbrilliancy with the first rays of the sun, so a few days more sufficed\r\nto restore Mary Wolston to better health than she had ever enjoyed in\r\nher life before. Some months now elapsed without giving rise to any\r\nevent of note. All the men, women, and children in the colony had been\r\nbusily employed from early morn to late at e'en. No sooner had one\r\nfield been sown than there was another to plant; then came the grain\r\nharvest and its hard but healthy toil; next, much to the delight of\r\nWillis, herrings appeared on the coast, followed by their attendant\r\ndemons, the sea-dogs; salmon-fishing, hunting ortolans, the foundries\r\nand manufactories, likewise exacted a portion of their time.\r\nFrequently parties were occupied for weeks together in the remote\r\ndistricts; so that, with the exception of one day each week--the\r\nSabbath--the two families had of late been rarely assembled together\r\nin one spot.\r\n\r\nThe hope of ever again beholding the _Nelson_ had gradually ceased to\r\nbe entertained by anybody. Like an echo that resounds from rock to\r\nrock until it is lost in the distance, this hope had died away in\r\ntheir breasts. Willis nevertheless continued to keep the beacon on\r\nShark's Island alight; but he regarded it more as a sepulchral lamp in\r\ncommemoration of the dead, than as a signal for the living.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the break of day was announced by a cannon-shot. All\r\ninstantly started on their feet and gazed inquiringly in each other's\r\nfaces. One thing forced itself upon all their thoughts--daybreak\r\ngenerally arrives without noise; it is not accustomed to announce\r\nitself with gunpowder; like real merit, it requires no flourish of\r\ntrumpets to announce its advent.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Becker; \"Fritz and Jack are not visible, therefore we may\r\neasily guess who fired that shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Particularly,\" added Wolston, \"as this is the first of January. Last\r\nnight I observed an unusual amount of going backwards and forwards,\r\nso, I suppose, nobody need be much at a loss to solve the mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" sighed Willis, \"New Year's Day brings pleasing recollections to\r\nmany, but sad ones to those who are far away from their own homes.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after, the absentees arrived, each mounted on his favorite\r\nostrich.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Wolston,\" said Fritz, spreading out a fine leopard's skin, \"be\r\ngood enough to accept this, with the compliments of the season.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wolston,\" said Jack, at the same time, \"here is the outer\r\ncovering of a panther, who, stifling with heat, commissioned me to\r\npresent you with his overcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very proud of your gift, Master Fritz,\" said Mrs. Wolston; \"it\r\nis really very handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may, perhaps, be useful at all events, madam,\" said Fritz; \"for,\r\nin the absence of universal pills and such things, it is a capital\r\npreventative of coughs and colds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been over the way again, then?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but, as you see, we adopted a more efficacious mode of\r\noperations than the one you suggested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" replied Willis, drily, \"you did not light a fire this time to\r\nfrighten the brutes away, and go to sleep when it went out!\"\r\n\r\nSophia then presented Willis with a handsome tobacco pouch, on which\r\nthe words, \"From Susan,\" were embroidered.\r\n\r\n\"Bless your dear little heart!\" said the sailor, whilst a tear\r\nsparkled in the corner of his eye, \"you make me almost think I am in\r\nOld England again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston, as Mary came running in.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, such a miracle, mamma! my parrot commenced talking this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did it say, child?\"\r\n\r\nHere Mary blushed and hesitated; Mrs. Wolston glanced at Fritz, and\r\nthought it might be as well not to inquire any further.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps somebody has changed it,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Not very likely that a strange parrot could pronounce my own name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps your own has been learning to spell for a long time,\r\nand has just succeeded in getting into words of two or more syllables.\r\nThese creatures abound in sell-esteem; and yours, perhaps, would not\r\nspeak till it could speak well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Odd, that it should pitch upon New Year's morning to say all sorts of\r\npretty things. They do not carry an almanack in their pockets, do\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Willis, \"parrots do say and do odd things. I heard of\r\none that once frightened away a burglar, by screaming out, 'The\r\nCampbells are coming;' so, Miss Wolston, perhaps yours does keep a\r\nlog.\"\r\n\r\n\"By counting its knuckles,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Counting one's knuckles is an ingenious, but rather a clumsy\r\nsubstitute for the calendar,\" remarked Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"And who invented the calendar?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"I am not aware that the calendar was ever invented,\" replied Wolston.\r\n\"Fruit commences by being a seed, the admiral springs from the\r\ncabin-boy, words and language succeed naturally the babble of the\r\ninfant; so, I presume, the calendar has grown up spontaneously to its\r\npresent degree of perfection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Wolston, but some one must have laid the first plank.\"\r\n\r\n\"The motions of the sun, moon, and stars would, in all probability,\r\nsuggest to the early inhabitants of our globe a natural means of\r\nmeasuring time. God, in creating the heavenly bodies, seems to have\r\nreflected that man would require some index to regulate his labors and\r\nthe acts of his civil life. The primary and most elementary\r\nsubdivisions of time are day and night, and it demanded no great\r\nstretch of human ingenuity to divide the day into two sections, called\r\nforenoon and afternoon, or into twelve sections, called hours. Such\r\nsubdivisions of time would probably suggest themselves simultaneously\r\nto all the nations of the earth. Necessity, who is the mother of all\r\ninvention, doubtless called the germs of our calendar into existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so far as the days and hours are concerned. There are other\r\ndivisions--weeks, for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"The division of time into weeks is a matter that belongs entirely to\r\nrevelation; the Jews keep the last day of every seven as a day of\r\nrest, in accordance with the law of Moses, and the Christians dedicate\r\nthe first day of every seven to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there are months.\"\r\n\r\n\"The month is another natural division. The return of the moon in\r\nconjunction with the sun, was observed to occur at regular intervals\r\nof twenty-nine days, twelve hours, and some minutes. This interval is\r\ncalled the _lunar month_, which for a long time was regarded as the\r\nradical unit in the admeasurement of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the year is now the unit, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in course of time the moon, in this respect, gave place to the\r\nsun. It was observed that the earth, in performing her revolution\r\nround the sun, always arrived at the same point of her orbit at the\r\nend of three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, fifty-eight\r\nminutes, and forty-five seconds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the earth invariably pass the same point at that interval?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, invariably; and the interval in question is termed the solar\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" remarked Jack, \"the perseverance of the earth is very\r\nmuch to be admired. It goes on eternally, always performing the same\r\njourney, never deviates from its path, and is never a minute too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the earth had performed her annual voyage in a certain number of\r\nentire days, the solar year would have been an exact unit of time; but\r\nthe odd fraction defied all our systems of calculation. Originally, we\r\nreckoned the year to consist of three hundred and sixty-five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And left the fraction to shift for itself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the consequence was, that the civil year was always nearly a\r\nquarter of a day behind; so that at the end of a hundred and\r\ntwenty-one years the civil year had become an entire month behind. The\r\nfirst month of winter found itself in autumn, the first month of\r\nspring in the middle of winter, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Rather a lubberly sort of log, that,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"This confusion became, with time, more and more embarrassing. Another\r\nevil was, likewise, eventually to be apprehended, for it was seen\r\nthat, on the expiring of fourteen hundred and sixty revolutions of the\r\nearth round the sun, fourteen hundred and sixty-one civil years would\r\nbe counted.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where would have been the evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"All relations between the dates and the seasons would have been\r\nobliterated, astronomical calculations would have become inaccurate,\r\nand the calendar virtually useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Willis, you that are so fertile in ideas, what would you have\r\ndone in such a case?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I! Why I scarcely know--perhaps run out a fresh cable and commenced a\r\nnew log.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your remedy,\" continued Wolston, \"might, perhaps, have obviated the\r\ndifficulty; but Julius Cæsar thought of another that answered the\r\npurpose equally well. It was simply to add to every fourth civil year\r\nan additional day, making it to consist of three hundred and sixty-six\r\ninstead of three hundred and sixty-five, This supplementary day was\r\ngiven to the month of February.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why February?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because February, at that time, was reckoned the last month of the\r\nyear. It was only in the reign of Charles IX. of France, or in the\r\nsecond half of the sixteenth century, that the civil year was made to\r\nbegin on the 1st of January. As the end of February was five days\r\nbefore the 1st or kalends of March, the extra day was known by the\r\nphrase _bis sexto_ (_ante_) _calendus martii_. Hence the fourth year\r\nis termed in the calendar _bissextile_, but is more usually called by\r\nus in England _leap year_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The remedy is certainly simple; but are your figures perfectly\r\nsquare? If you add a day every four years, do you not overleap the\r\nearth's fraction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from ten to eleven minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what becomes of these minutes? Are they allowed to run up another\r\nscore?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly. In 1582, the civil year had got ten clear days the\r\nstart of the solar year, and Pope Gregory XIII. resolved to cancel\r\nthem, which he effected by calling the day after the 4th of October\r\nthe 15th.\"\r\n\r\n\"That manner of altering the rig and squaring the yards,\" said Willi\r\nlaughing, \"would make the people that lived then ten days older. If it\r\nhad been ten years, the matter would have been serious. Had the Pope\r\nsaid to me privately, 'Willis, you are now only forty-seven, but\r\nto-morrow, my boy, you will fill your sails and steer right into\r\nfifty-seven,' I should have turned 'bout ship and cleared off. Few men\r\ncare about being put upon a short allowance of life, any more than we\r\nsailors on short rations of rum.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget, Willis, that, though ten years were added to your\r\nage, you would not have died a day sooner for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, it is my idea that the Pope was not much smarter at taking a\r\nlatitude than Mr. Julius Cæsar--but what are you laughing at?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing; only Julius Cæsar is not generally honored with the prefix\r\n_Mr_. It is something like the French, who insist upon talking of _Sir\r\nNewton_ and _Mr. William Shakespeare_; the latter, however, by way of\r\namends, they sometimes style the _immortal Williams_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad, though, as a Frenchman I once met, who firmly believed\r\nthe Yankees lived on a soup made of bunkum and soft-sawder. But who\r\nwas Julius Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julius Cæsar,\" replied Jack, sententiously, \"was first of all an\r\nauthor, Laving published at Rome an Easy Introduction to the Latin\r\nLanguage; he afterwards turned general, conquered France and England,\r\nand gave _Mr._ Pompey a sound thrashing at the battle of Pharsalia.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have been a clever fellow to do all that; still, my idea\r\ncontinues the same. When he began to caulk the calendar, he ought to\r\nhave finished the business in a workmanlike manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, however,\" continued Wolston, \"he left to Pope Gregory, who\r\ndecreed that three leap years should be suppressed in four centuries.\r\nThus, the years 1700 and 1800, which should have been leap years, did\r\nnot reckon the extra day; so the years 2000 and 2400 will likewise be\r\ndeprived of their supplementary four-and-twenty hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one difficulty about this mode of stowing away extra days;\r\nthese leap years may be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you keep in mind that leap years alone admit of being divided\r\nby four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the Pope manage to get entirely rid of the fraction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not entirely; but the error does not exceed one day in four thousand\r\nyears, and is so small that it is not likely to derange ordinary\r\ncalculations; and so, Willis, you now know the origin of the calendar,\r\nand likewise how time came to be divided into weeks, months, and\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have only spoken of the Christian calendar,\" remarked Ernest.\r\n\"There have been several other systems in use. Those curious people\r\nthat call themselves the children of the sun and moon, possess a mode\r\nof reckoning that carries them back to a period anterior to the\r\ncreation of the world. Then, the Greeks computed by Olympiads, or\r\nperiods of four years. The Romans reckoned by lustri of five years,\r\nthe first of which corresponds with the 117th year of the foundation\r\nof Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when does our calendar begin?\"\r\n\r\n\"It dates only from the birth of Christ, but may be carried back to\r\nthe creation, which event, to the best of our knowledge, occurred four\r\nthousand and four years before the birth of our Savior. This period,\r\nadded to the date of the present, or any future year, gives us, as\r\nnearly as we can ascertain, the interval that has elapsed since our\r\nfirst parents found themselves in the garden of Eden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our calendar,\" remarked Jack, \"appears simple enough; it is to be\r\nregretted that there have been, and are, so many other modes of\r\nreckoning extant. What with the Greek Olympiads, the Roman lustres,\r\nthe Mahometan hegira, and Chinese moonshine, there is nothing but\r\nperplexity and confusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, however,\" said Becker, \"to accommodate all these\r\nsystems with each other. Leaving the Chinese out of the question, we\r\nhave only to bear in mind, that the Christian era begins on the first\r\nyear of the 194th Olympiad, 753 years after the building of Rome, and\r\n622 years before the Mahometan hegira. These three figures will serve\r\nus as flambeaux to all the dates of both ancient and modern history.\"\r\n\r\nThe discourse was here interrupted by Toby, who entered the room, and\r\nwas gleefully frisking and bounding round Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" observed Mrs. Becker, \"Toby does seem to know that this is\r\nNew Year's Day, he looks so lively and so smart.\"\r\n\r\nThe animal, in point of fact, wore a new collar, and seemed conscious\r\nthat he was more than usually attractive that particular morning. At a\r\nsign from Mary, the intelligent brute went and wagged his tail to\r\nFritz. Hereupon the young man, observing the collar more closely,\r\nnoticed the following words embroidered upon it: _I belong now\r\nentirely to Master Fritz, who rescued my mistress from the sea_.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Miss Wolston,\" said Fritz, \"you forget I only did my duty; you\r\nmust not allow your gratitude to over-estimate the service I rendered\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare,\" cried Mrs. Wolston, laughing \"here is another\r\nanimal that speaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"The age of Aesop revived,\" suggested Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Master Jack?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston. \"Do you suppose\r\nthat Toby has learned embroidery in the same way that the parrot\r\nlearned grammar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, more astonishing things than that have happened! Mr. Wolston\r\nthere will tell you that he has seen a wooden figure playing at chess;\r\nwhy, therefore, should the most sagacious of all the brutes not learn\r\nknitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, in speaking so highly of the dog,\" replied Mrs. Wolston, \"you\r\nare doing injustice to other animals. Marvellous instances of\r\nsagacity, gratitude, and affection, have been shown by other brutes\r\nbeside the dog. A horse of Caligula's was elevated to the dignified\r\noffice of consul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and talking of the affection of animals,\" observed Ernest, \"puts\r\nme in mind of an anecdote related by Aulus Gellius. It seems that a\r\nlittle boy, the son of a fisher man, who had to go from Baiæ to his\r\nschool at Puzzoli, used to stop at the same hour each day on the brink\r\nof the Lucrine lake. Here he often threw a bit of his breakfast to a\r\nDolphin that he called Simon, and if the creature was not waiting for\r\nhim when he arrived, he had only to pronounce this name, and it\r\ninstantly appeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing very wonderful in that,\" said Jack; \"the common gudgeon,\r\nwhich is the stupidest fish to be found in fresh water, would do that\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but listen a moment. The dolphin, after having received his\r\npittance, presented his back to the boy, after having tacked in all\r\nhis spines and prickles as well as he could, and carried him right\r\nacross the lake, thus saving the little fellow a long roundabout walk;\r\nand not only that, but after school hours it was waiting to carry him\r\nback again. This continued almost daily for a year or two; but at last\r\nthe boy died, and the dolphin, after waiting day after day for his\r\nreappearance, pined away, and was found dead at the usual place of\r\nrendezvous. The affectionate creature was taken out of the lake, and\r\nburied beside its friend.[D]\r\n\r\n\"And, on the other hand,\" added Jack, \"if animals sometimes attach\r\nthemselves to us, we attach ourselves to them. We are told that\r\nCrassus wore mourning for a dead ferret, the death of which grieved\r\nhim as much as if it had been his own daughter.[E] Augustus crucified\r\none of his slaves, who had roasted and eaten a quail, that had fought\r\nand conquered in the circus.[F] Antonia, daughter-in-law of Tiberius,\r\nfastened ear-rings to some lampreys that she was passionately fond\r\nof.\"[G]\r\n\r\n\"That, at all events, was attachment in one sense of the word,\" said\r\nMrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Without reference to the dog in particular,\" continued Jack, \"proofs\r\nof sagacity in animals are very numerous. The nautilus, when he wants\r\nto take an airing, capsizes his shell, and converts it into a gondola;\r\nthen he hoists a thin membrane that serves for a sail; two of his\r\narms are resolved into oars, and his tail performs the functions of a\r\nrudder. There are insects ingenious enough to make dwellings for\r\nthemselves in the body of a leaf as thin as paper. At the approach of\r\na storm some spiders take in a reef or two of their webs, so as to be\r\nless at the mercy of the wind. Beavers will erect walls, and construct\r\nhouses more skilfully than our ablest architects. Chimpanzees have\r\nbeen known spontaneously to sit themselves down, and perform the\r\noperation of shaving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Jack,\" cried Mrs. Wolston; \"I must yield to such a deluge of\r\nargument, and admit that Toby may have acquired the art of embroidery\r\nwith or without a master, only I should like to see some other\r\nspecimen of his skill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably you will by-and-by,\" replied Jack, laughing, \"if you keep\r\nyour eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sophia came into the room leading her gazelle.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, just in time,\" said Mrs. Wolston; \"here is another animal that\r\nprobably has something to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong, mamma,\" replied Sophia; \"my gazelle is as mute as a mermaid.\r\nVery provoking, is it not, when all the other animals in the house\r\ntalk?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better apply to Master Jack; he may, probably, be able to hit\r\nupon a plan to make your gazelle communicative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you, Master Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Miss Sophia. The plan I would suggest is very simple. Feed\r\nhim for a week or two with nouns, adjectives, and verbs.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sophia, addressing her gazelle, said, \"Master Jack Becker is a\r\ngoose.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime Fritz was leaning on the back of Mary's chair.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Wolston,\" said he, \"did you not tell me that you had brought\r\nToby up, and that you were very fond of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Fritz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it would be unfair in me to withdraw his allegiance from you\r\nnow, and, consequently, I must refuse your present\"\r\n\r\n\"But where would have been the merit of the gift if I did not hold\r\nhim in some esteem? Besides, I thought you were fond of Toby.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am, Miss Wolston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will not be indebted to me for anything--I owe you much.\"\r\n\r\n\"No such thing; you owe me nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life, then, is nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not mean that; I must beg your pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I will only grant on condition you accept my gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you insist upon it, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see him as before; the only difference will be that you are his\r\nmaster, in all other respects he will belong to us both.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I know what your knight-errant is saying to you, Mary?\" inquired\r\nMrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have been so angry with him; he was going to refuse my\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was very naughty of him, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has, however, consented, like a dutiful squire, to obey my\r\nbehests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, Toby is henceforth to be divided between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Divided?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is, he is to be nominally mine, but virtually to belong to\r\nus both. Is it not so, Miss Wolston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Fritz.\"\r\n\r\nOn his side, Jack had approached Miss Sophia.\r\n\r\n\"So you won't give me your gazelle?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not, Mr. Jack,\" replied Sophia; \"if you had saved my\r\nlife, as Fritz saved my sister's, I should then have had the right to\r\nmake you a present. But you know it is not my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor mine either,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not; but if I had fallen into the sea, you would have allowed\r\nthe sharks to swallow me, would you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish we had been attacked by a hyena or a bear on our way to\r\nWaldeck.\"\r\n\r\n\"God be thanked, that we were not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but look here, Miss Sophia; let me paint the scene. You have\r\nfainted, as a matter of course, and fallen prostrate on the ground,\r\ninsensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is likely enough, if we had encountered one of the animals you\r\nmention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I throw myself between you and the savage brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supposing you were not half a mile off at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that--he rises, on his hind legs, and glares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a hyena or a bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, whichever you like--he opens his jaws, and growls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the wolf at Little Red Riding Hood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I plunge my arm down his throat and choke him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clever, very; but are you not wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, however; all my thoughts are centred in you--I\r\nthink of nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am insensible, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, more than ever--we all run towards you, and exert ourselves to\r\nbring you back to your senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I come to life again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, stop a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is tiresome to be so long insensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother has luckily a bottle of salts, which she holds to your\r\nnose--I run off to the nearest brook, and return with water in the\r\ncrown of my cap, with which I bathe your temples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in that case, I should open one eye at least. Which eye is opened\r\nfirst after fainting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, to avoid mistakes, I should open both.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only then, when I find you are recovering, that I discover the\r\nbrute has severely bitten my arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then comes my turn to nurse you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You express your thanks in your sweetest tones, and I forget my\r\nwounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet tones do no harm, if they are accompanied with salves and\r\nointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, I am obliged to carry my arm in a sling for three months\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that not rather long?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; because your arm, in some sort, supplies, meantime, the place of\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your picture has, at least, the merit of being poetic. Is it\r\nfinished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till next New Year's Day, when you present me with an embroidered\r\nscarf, as the ladies of yore used to do to the knights that defended\r\nthem from dragons and that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity all this should be only a dream!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am not particularly extravagant, at all events; others dream\r\nof fortune, honor, and glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whilst you confine your aspirations to a bear, a bite, and a scarf.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see nothing was wanted but the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And foresight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foresight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; if you had previously made arrangements with a bear, the whole\r\nscene might have been realized.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are joking, whilst I am taking the matter _au serieux_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That order is usually reversed; generally you are the quiz and I am\r\nthe quizzee.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will admit, at all events, that I would not have permitted the\r\nbear to eat you.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sophia burst into a peal of laughter, and vanished with her\r\ngazelle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[D] Aulus Gellius, VII., 8.\r\n\r\n[E] Macrobius, _Saturn_, XL, 4.\r\n\r\n[F] Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[G] Pliny, IX., 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSEPARATION--GUELPHS AND GHIBELINES--MONTAGUES AND\r\nCAPULETS--SADNESS--THE REUNION--JOCKO AND HIS EDUCATION--THE\r\nENTERTAINMENTS OF A KING--THE MULES OF NERO AND THE ASSES OF\r\nPOPPÆA--HERCULES AND ACHILLES--LIBERTY AND EQUALITY--SEMIRAMIS AND\r\nELIZABETH--CHRISTIANITY AND THE RELIGION OF ZOROASTER--THE WILLISONIAN\r\nMETHOD--MORAL DISCIPLINE VERSUS BIRCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter was now drawing near, with its storms and deluges. Becker\r\ntherefore felt that it was necessary to make some alterations in their\r\ndomestic arrangements; and he saw that, for this season at all events,\r\nthe two families must be separated--this was to create a desert within\r\na desert; but propriety and convenience demanded the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Wolston and his family should be quartered at\r\nRockhouse, whilst Becker and his family should pass the rainy season\r\nat Falcon's Nest, where, though these aerial dwellings were but\r\nindifferently adapted for winter habitations, they had passed the\r\nfirst year of their sojourn in the colony. The rains came and\r\nsubmerged the country between the two families, thus, for a time,\r\ncutting off all communication between them. The barriers that\r\nseparated the Guelphs from the Ghibelines, the Montagues from the\r\nCapulets, the Burgundians from the Armagnacs, and the House of York\r\nfrom that of Lancaster, could not have been more impenetrable than\r\nthat which now existed between the Wolstons and Beckers.\r\n\r\nWhenever a lull occurred in the storm, or a ray of sunshine shot\r\nthrough the murky clouds, all eyes were mechanically turned to the\r\nwindow, but only to turn them away again with a sigh; so completely\r\nhad the waters invaded the land, that nothing short of the dove from\r\nNoah's Ark could have performed the journey between Rockhouse and\r\nFalcon's Nest.\r\n\r\nDulness and dreariness reigned triumphant at both localities. The calm\r\ntranquility that Becker's family formerly enjoyed under similar\r\ncircumstances had fled. They felt that happiness was no longer to be\r\nenjoyed within the limits of their own circle. Study and conversation\r\nlost their charms; and if they laughed now, the smile never extended\r\nbeyond the tips of their lips. The young people often wished they\r\npossessed Fortunatus's cap, or Aladdin's wonderful lamp, to transport\r\nthem from the one dwelling to the other; but as they could obtain no\r\nsuch occult mode of conveyance, there was no remedy for their miseries\r\nbut patience. To the Wolstons this interval of compulsory separation\r\nwas particularly irksome, as this was the first time in their lives\r\nthat they had been entirely isolated for any length of time.\r\n\r\nAt Falcon's Nest, Ernest was the most popular member of the domestic\r\ncircle. His astronomical predilections made him the Sir Oracle of the\r\nstorm, and he was constantly being asked for information relative to\r\nthe progress and probable duration of the rains. Every morning he was\r\ncalled upon for a report as to the state of the weather; but, with all\r\nhis skill, he could afford them very little consolation.\r\n\r\nBut all things come to an end, as well as regards our troubles as our\r\njoys. One morning, Ernest reported that less rain had fallen during\r\nthe preceding than any former night of the season; the next morning a\r\nstill more favorable report was presented; and on the third morning\r\nthe floods had subsided, but had left a substratum of mud that\r\nobliterated all traces of the roads. Notwithstanding this, and a smart\r\nshower that continued to fall, Fritz and Jack determined to force a\r\npassage to Rockhouse.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, the two young men returned, soaking with wet and\r\ncovered with mud, but with light hearts, for they had found their\r\ncompanions in the enjoyment of perfect health and in the best spirits.\r\nThey brought back with them a missive, couched in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Wolston, greeting, desire the favor of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBecker's company to dinner, together with their entire family, this\r\nday se'nnight, weather permitting.\"\r\n\r\nErnest was hereupon consulted, and stated that, in so far as the rain\r\nwas concerned, they should in eight days be able to undertake the\r\njourney to Rockhouse. This assurance was not, however, entirely relied\r\nupon, for between this and then many an anxious eye was turned\r\nskywards, as if in search of some more conclusive evidence. Those who\r\npossess a garden--and he who has not, were it only a box of\r\nmignionette at the window--will often have observed, in consequence of\r\nabsence or forgetfulness, that their flowers have begun to droop; they\r\nhasten to sprinkle them with water, then watch anxiously for signs of\r\ntheir revival. So both families continued unceasingly during these\r\neight days to note the ever-varying modifications of the clouds.\r\n\r\nAt length the much wished-for day arrived; the morning broke with a\r\nblaze of sunshine, and though hidden with a dense mist, the ground was\r\nsufficiently hardened to bear their weight. Wolston awaited his guests\r\nat a bridge of planks that had been thrown across the Jackal River,\r\nwhere he and Willis had erected a sort of triumphal arch of mangoe\r\nleaves and palm branches. Here Becker and his family were welcomed, as\r\nif the one party had just arrived from Tobolsk, and the other from\r\nChandernagor, after an absence of ten years.\r\n\r\nAnother warm reception awaited them at Rockhouse, where an abundant\r\nrepast was already spread in the gallery. Mrs. Becker had often\r\nintended to work herself a pair of gloves, but the increasing demand\r\nfor stockings had hitherto prevented her. She was pleased, therefore,\r\non sitting down to dinner, to discover a couple of pairs under her\r\nplate, with her own initials embroidered upon them.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said she, \"I was almost afraid I had lost my daughters, but I\r\nhave found them again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the girls showed her a quantity of cotton they had spun,\r\nwhich proved that, though they might have been dull, they had, at\r\nleast, been industrious.\r\n\r\n\"Mary span the most of it,\" said Sophia; \"but you know, Mrs. Becker,\r\nshe is the biggest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then,\" said Jack, \"the power of spinning depends upon the bulk\r\nof the spinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Master Jack, I thought you had been ill, that you had not\r\ncommenced quizzing us before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind him, Soffy,\" said her father; \"to quote Hudibras,\r\n\r\n  \"There's nothing on earth hath so perfect a phiz,\r\n  As not to give birth to a passable quiz.\"\r\n\r\nHere Willis led in the chimpanzee, who made a grimace to the assembled\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\"Now, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Willis, \"Jocko is about to show you\r\nthe progress he has made in splicing and bracing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Becker, \"you have been able to make something of him,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see presently. Jocko, bring me a plate.\"\r\n\r\nHereupon the chimpanzee seized a bottle of Rockhouse malaga, and\r\nfilled a glass.\r\n\r\n\"He has erred on the safe side there,\" said Jack, drily.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" added Willis, laughing, \"we must let that pass. Jocko,\" said\r\nhe, assuming a sententious tone, \"I asked you for a plate.\"\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee looked at him, hesitated a moment, then seized the\r\nglass, and drank the contents off at a single draught. A box on the\r\nears then sent him gibbering into a corner.\r\n\r\n\"Your servant,\" remarked Mrs. Wolston, \"has been taking lessons from\r\nDean Swift as well as yourself, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will serve him out for that, the swab; he does not play any of\r\nthose tricks when we are alone. I must admit, however, that I am\r\ngenerally in the habit of helping myself.\"\r\n\r\nHere attention was called to the parrot, who was screaming out\r\nlustily, \"I love Mary, I love Sophia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa,\" exclaimed Fritz, \"Polly loves everybody now, does she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" replied Sophia, \"I grew tired of hearing him scream\r\nalways that he loved my sister, so by means of a little coaxing, and a\r\ngood deal of sugar, I got him to love me too.\"\r\n\r\nThe poultry were next mustered for the inspection of their old\r\nmasters. These did not consist of the ordinary domestic fowls alone;\r\namongst them were a beautiful flamingo, some cranes, bustards, and a\r\nvariety of tame tropical birds. With the fowls came the pigeons, which\r\nwere perching about them in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"We are now something like the court of France in the fourteenth\r\ncentury,\" said Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" inquired Becker.\r\n\r\n\"In the reign of Charles V., they were obliged to place a trellis at\r\nthe windows of the Palace of St. Paul to prevent the poultry from\r\ninvading the dining room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rural anyhow,\" observed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, most other features of the palace were in unison with this\r\nprimitive state of matters. The courtiers sat on stools. There was\r\nonly one chair in the palace, that was the arm-chair of the king,\r\nwhich was covered with red leather, and ornamented with silk fringes.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that we may console ourselves with the reflection, that we are as\r\ncomfortable here as kings were at that epoch in Europe,\" remarked\r\nErnest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; historians report, that when Alphonso V. of Portugal went to\r\nParis to solicit the aid of Louis XI. against the King of Arragon, who\r\nhad taken Castile from him, the French monarch received him with great\r\nhonor, and endeavored to make his stay as agreeable as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reviews, I suppose, feasts, tournaments, spectacles, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"A residence was assigned him in the Rue de Prouvaires, at the house\r\nof one Laurent Herbelot, a grocer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! amongst dried peas and preserved plums?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely; but the house of Herbelot might then have been one of the\r\nmost commodious buildings in all Paris. Alphonso was afterwards\r\nconducted to the palace, where he pleaded his cause before the king.\r\nNext day he was entertained at the archiepiscopal residence, where he\r\nwitnessed the induction of a doctor in theology. The day after that a\r\nprocession to the university was organized, which passed under the\r\ngrocer's windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"These were singular marvels to entertain a king withal,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Such were the amusements peculiar to the epoch. It must be observed\r\nthat the Louis in question was somewhat close-fisted, and rarely drew\r\nhis purse-strings unless he was certain of a good interest for his\r\nmoney. But courts in those days were very simple and frugal. The\r\nsumptuary laws of Philip le Bel (1285) had fixed supper at three\r\ndishes and a lard soup. The king's own dinner was likewise limited to\r\nthree dishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"These three dishes might, however, have yielded a better repast than\r\nthe fifty-two saucers of the Chinese,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No one could obtain permission to give his wife four dresses a year,\r\nunless he had an income of six thousand francs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What business had the laws to interfere with these things, I should\r\nlike to know?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Those who possessed two thousand francs income were only allowed to\r\nwear one dress a year, the cloth for which was not permitted to exceed\r\ntenpence a yard; but ladies of rank could go as high as fifteen\r\npence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philip le Bel must have been an old woman,\" insisted Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"No private citizen was permitted to use a carriage, and such persons\r\nwere likewise interdicted the use of flambeaux.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were permitted to break their necks at all events, that is\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"In England, the same primitive simplicity prevailed; Queen Elizabeth\r\nis said to have breakfasted on a gallon of ale, her dining-room floor\r\nwas strewn every day with fresh straw or rushes, and she had only one\r\npair of silk stockings in her entire wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time,\" observed Ernest, \"these usages stand in singular\r\ncontradiction to those that prevailed at an earlier age. The supper of\r\nLucullus rarely cost him less than thirty thousand francs, and he\r\ncould entertain five and twenty thousand guests. Six citizens of Rome\r\npossessed a great part of Africa. Domitius had an estate in France of\r\neighty thousand acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"When Nero went to Baize he was accompanied by a thousand chariots and\r\ntwo thousand mules caparisoned with silver. Poppæa followed him with\r\nfive hundred she asses to furnish milk for her bath. Cicero purchased\r\na dining-room table that cost him a million sesterces, or about two\r\nhundred thousand francs. I can understand the progress of\r\ncivilization, and I can also understand civilization remaining\r\nstationary for a given period; but I cannot understand why a citizen\r\nof ancient Rome should be able to lodge twenty-five thousand men,\r\nwhilst a king of France could scarcely keep the ducks from waddling\r\nabout his apartments, and a queen of England could fare no better than\r\na ploughman.\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" replied Frank, \"there were no other criterion of civilization\r\nthan luxury and riches, you would have good grounds for surprise; but\r\nsuch is not the case. Between ancient and modern times, Christianity\r\narose, and that has tended in some degree to keep down the ostentation\r\nof the rich, and to augment, at the same time, the comforts of the\r\npoor. In place of the heroes, Hercules and Achilles, we have had the\r\napostles Peter and Paul; so Luther and Calvin have been substituted\r\nfor Semiramis and Nero. Pride has given place to charity, and\r\ncorruption to virtue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that it were so, Frank,\" continued Ernest. \"Christianity has,\r\ndoubtless, effected many beneficial changes, and produced many able\r\nmen; but in this last respect antiquity has not been behind. It has\r\nalso its sages: Thales, Socrates, and Pythagoras, for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Frank, \"antiquity has produced some virtuous men, but\r\ntheir virtue was ideal, and their creed a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Stoics?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Stoics despised suffering, and Christians resign themselves to\r\nits chastisements; this constitutes one of the lines of demarcation\r\nbetween ancient and modern theology.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there were many signal instances of virtue manifested in ancient\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but for the most part, it was either exaggerated or false;\r\nunyielding pride, obstinate courage, implacable resentment of\r\ninjuries. Errors promenaded in robes under the porticos. Ambition was\r\nhonored in Alexander, suicide in Cato, and assassination in Brutus.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what say you to Plato?\"\r\n\r\n\"The immolation of ill-formed children, and of those born without the\r\npermission of the laws, prosecution of strangers and slavery; such\r\nwere the basis of his boasted republic, and the gospel of his\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, are these men held up as models for our imitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they are distant and dead; likewise, because they were, in\r\nmany respects, great and wise, considering the paganism and darkness\r\nwith which they were surrounded. Life was then only sacred to the few;\r\nthe many were treated as beasts of burden. The Emperor Claudian even\r\nfelt bound to issue an edict prohibiting slaves from being slain _when\r\nthey were old and feeble_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which leaves a margin for us to suppose that they might be slain when\r\nthey were young and strong,\" observed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"By the constitution of Constantine certain cases were defined, where\r\na master might suspend his slave by the feet, have him torn by wild\r\nbeasts, or tortured by slow fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does slavery and its horrors not still exist, for example, in Russia\r\nand the United States of America?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slavery does exist, to the great disgrace of modern civilization, in\r\nthe countries you mention; but, so far as I am aware, its horrors are\r\nnot recognized by the laws.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Mr. Frank,\" said Wolston, \"I am very sorry to be under the\r\nnecessity of contradicting you. I have visited the slave states of\r\nNorth America, and have witnessed atrocities perhaps less brutal, but\r\nnot less heart-rending, than those you mention.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do the laws recognize them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tacitly; the testimony of the slaves themselves is not received\r\nas evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do a people that call their county a refuge for the down-trodden\r\nnations of Europe suffer such abominations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, according to themselves, it is entirely a question of the\r\n_almighty dollar_. If there were no slaves, the swamps and morasses of\r\nthe south could not be cultivated. It has been found that the negro\r\nwill dance, and sing, and starve, but he will not work in the fields\r\nwhen free. Besides, they assert, that the slaves are generally well\r\ncared for, and that it is only a few detestable masters that beat them\r\ncruelly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, at all events, dollars are preferred to humanity by the United\r\nStates men, in spite of their vaunted emblems--liberty and equality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. In all matters of internal policy, the dollar reigns\r\nsupreme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admitting,\" continued Frank, \"that the evils of slavery may exist in\r\na section of the American Union, and amongst the barbarous hordes of\r\nRussia, these evils are trifling in comparison with others that stain\r\nthe annals of antiquity. We are told that a hundred and twenty persons\r\napplied to Otho to be rewarded for killing Galba. That so many men\r\nshould contend for the honor of premeditated murder, is sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic of the epoch. There was then no corruption, no brutal\r\npassion, that had not its temple and its high priest. In the midst of\r\nall this wickedness and vice there appeared a man, poor and humble,\r\nwho accomplished what no man ever did before, and what no man will\r\never do again--he founded a moral and eternal civilization. Judaism\r\nand the religion of Zoroaster were overthrown. The gods of Tyre and\r\nCarthage were destroyed. The beliefs of Miltiades and of Pericles, of\r\nScipio and Seneca, were disavowed. The thousands that flocked annually\r\nto worship the Eleusinian Ceres ceased their pilgrimage. Odin and his\r\ndisciples have all perished. The very language of Osiris, which was\r\nafterwards spoken by the Ptolemies, is no longer known to his\r\ndescendants. The paganisms which still exist in the East are rapidly\r\nyielding to the march of western intelligence. Christianity alone,\r\namidst all these ring and fallen fabrics, retains its original\r\nvitality, for, like its author, it is imperishable.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious thing what we call conversation,\" observed Mrs.\r\nWolston. \"No sooner is one subject broached than another is\r\nintroduced; and we go on from one thing to another until the original\r\nidea is lost sight of. Leaving the palace of Charles V., to go with\r\nthe King of Portugal to a grocer's shop in some street or other of\r\nParis, we cross the Alps, the Himalaya, and the Atlantic. Lucullus,\r\nNero, Achilles, Peter, Paul, Tyre and Sidon, Semiramis and\r\nElizabeth--queens, saints, and philosophers, are all passed in review,\r\nand why? Because the pigeons put my husband in mind of the Palace of\r\nSt. Paul!\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" observed Jack; \"these pigeons are carriers, and naturally\r\nsuggest wandering.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more seated round the table, Fritz, observing that the\r\nmisunderstanding between Willis and the chimpanzee still continued,\r\nthrust a plate into the hand of the latter, and pointed with his\r\nfinger to Willis. This time Jocko obeyed, for the language was\r\nintelligible, and he went and placed the plate before his master.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho!\" cried Willis, \"so you have come to your senses at last, have\r\nyou? Well, that saves you an extra lesson to-morrow, you lubber you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He takes rather long to obey your orders, though, Willis; it is\r\nrather awkward to wait an hour for anything you ask for. What system\r\ndo you pursue in educating him--the Pestalozzian or the parochial?\"\r\n\r\n\"We follow the system in fashion aboard ship,\" replied Willis.\r\n\r\n\"And what does that consist of?\"\r\n\r\n\"A rope's end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, you are an advocate for the birch, are you?\" said Wolston;\r\n\"it is, doubtless, a very good thing when moderately and judiciously\r\nadministered. That puts me in mind of the missionary and the king of\r\nthe Kuruman negroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tribe of Southern Africa, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the missionary and the king were great friends. The king not\r\nonly permitted him to baptize his subjects, but offered to whip them\r\nall into Christianity in a week. This summary mode of proselytism did\r\nnot, however, coincide with the Englishman's ideas, and he refused the\r\noffer, although the king insisted that it was the only kind of\r\nargument that could ever reach their understandings.\"\r\n\r\nThe day at length drew to a close, and, though no one asked the time\r\nyet all felt that the moment of departure was approaching; whether\r\nthey were willing to go was doubtful, but at they were loth to depart\r\nwas certain.\r\n\r\n\"It is time to return now,\" said Becker, rising.\r\n\r\n\"Already!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some clouds in the distance that bode no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than a little rain at worst,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"And your mother?\" inquired Decker.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! we can make a palanquin for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your plan, Jack, is not particularly bright; it puts me in mind of\r\nsome genius or other that took shelter in the water to keep out of the\r\nwet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very odd,\" said Jack, \"we are always wishing for rain, and when it\r\ncomes, we do all we can to keep out of its way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, because we are neither green pease nor gooseberries,\" said\r\nErnest, drily.\r\n\r\n\"True, brother; and as the rain is your affair, perhaps you will be\r\ngood enough to delay it for an hour or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry on my own account, as well as yours, that I have not yet\r\ndiscovered the art of controlling the skies.\"\r\n\r\nHere Fritz whispered a few words in his mother's ear, that called up\r\none of those ineffable smiles that the maternal heart alone can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"if you think so, deliver the message\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Wolston,\" said Fritz, \"I am charged to invite you and your\r\nfamily to Falcon's Nest this day week.\"\r\n\r\n\"The invitation is accepted, unless my daughters have any objections\r\nto urge.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you fancy such a thing, mamma?\" said both girls.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, that my daughters have got such a dread of cold water,\r\nthat they dread to wet the soles of their shoes, unless one or other\r\nof you gentlemen is within hail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mamma does so love to tease us,\" said Mary; \"we are afraid of nothing\r\nbut putting you to inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in that case, we shall be at Falcon's Nest on the appointed\r\nday, unless the roads are positively submerged.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Jack, \"a line of canoes will be placed upon the\r\nhighway, between the two localities.\"\r\n\r\nAs the prospect of a prize incites the young scholar to increased\r\nexertion--as the prospect of worldly honors urges the ambitious man on\r\nin his career--as the oasis cheers the weary traveller on his journey\r\nthrough the desert, and makes him forget hunger and thirst--as the\r\ndreams of comfort and home warm the blood of a wayfarer amongst snow\r\nand ice--as hope smooths the ruggedness of poverty and softens the\r\ncalamities of adversity, so the prospect of meeting again mitigates\r\nthe regrets of parting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nWHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY--MUCIUS SCÆVOLA--WHAT'S TO BE\r\nDONE?--BRUTUS TORQUATUS AND PETER THE GREAT--AUSTRALIA, BOTANY BAY,\r\nAND THE FLYING DUTCHMAN--NEW GUINEA AND THE BUCCANEER--VANCOUVER'S\r\nISLAND--WHITE SKINS--DANGER OF LANDING ON A WAVE--HANGED OR\r\nDROWNED--ROUTE TO HAPPINESS--OMENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old saw, _Where there's a will there's a way_, means--if it means\r\nanything--that a great deal may be effected by energy. A man without\r\nenergy is a helpless character, and invariably lags behind his fellow\r\nmortals in the stream of life; like a cork in an eddy, he is rebuffed\r\nhere and jostled there, and goes on travelling in a circle to the end\r\nof the chapter. Not so the man of action; no jostling thwarts him, no\r\nrebuffs retard him; he breaks through all sorts of obstacles, and\r\nfloats along with the current.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was Becker. Though surrounded with dangers, and harassed by\r\nthe elements, almost alone he had converted a wilderness into fertile\r\nfields; he pursued the track that his judgment suggested, and followed\r\nit up with invincible resolution; he manfully resisted the severest\r\ntrials, and cheerfully bore the heaviest burdens; his reliance on\r\nTruth or Virtue and on God were unfaltering; but had he provided for\r\nevery emergency? Is mortal power capable of overcoming every\r\ndifficulty? We shall see.\r\n\r\nA day or two after the entertainment at Rockhouse, Becker whispered to\r\nthe Pilot--\r\n\r\n\"Willis, take a rifle, and come along with me; I have something to say\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked a quarter of an hour or so without uttering a word, when\r\nWillis broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"You seem sad, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Willis, I am almost distracted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, you seem well enough; you are as hale and hearty as if you\r\nhad just been keel-hauled and got a new rig.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not my body that is suffering, Willis; it is my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willis, _my wife is dying_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. For a long period Becker's wife had been a prey to\r\nracking pains, which, so to speak, she hid from herself, the better to\r\nconceal them from others, just as if suffering had been a crime. After\r\nhaving resisted for fourteen years the afflictions of exile, long and\r\nperilous expeditions, nights passed under tents, humid winters and\r\nfierce burning summers, her health had, at length, succumbed, not all\r\nat once, like fabrics sapped by gunpowder, but little by little, like\r\nthose that are demolished piecemeal with the pickaxe of the workman.\r\nDay by day she grew more and more feeble, without those who were\r\nconstantly by her side observing the insidious workings of disease.\r\nLike Mucius Scævola, who held his hands in a burning brazier without\r\nuttering a word, she so effectually hid her griefs within the recesses\r\nof her own bosom, that no one even suspected her illness.\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Becker,\" said Willis, \"I saw your wife this morning, and she\r\nseemed as well as usual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _seemed_, Willis, that is true enough; not to give us pain, she\r\nhas concealed her illness from us all. It is only within the last\r\ntwelve hours that I accidentally discovered that she has been long\r\nlaboring under some fearful malady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the nature of the disease?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that I have no means of ascertaining; it may be a distinct form\r\nof disease, or it may be a complication of disorders, which I know\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would not signify about the name if we only knew a remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but I dread some malady of a cancerous type, which could not be\r\neradicated without surgical skill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had been born a doctor instead of a pilot,\" sighed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see her perish before my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Becker; it would never do to allow a ship to sink\r\nif she can be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"There lies the difficulty; had it been a question of anything that\r\nfloats on the water, I might have suggested a remedy; but, in this\r\ncase, I am fairly run aground.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know too well what must be done, Willis. In cases of ordinary\r\nmaladies, with care and due precaution, proper nourishment and time,\r\nNature will generally effect a cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nature has no diploma, but she accomplishes more cures than those\r\nthat have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately this is not a malady that can be cured by such means;\r\nand, unless its progress be checked in time, it may ultimately assume\r\na form that will render a cure impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is death, then, inevitable?\"\r\n\r\n\"A patient may retain a languishing life under such circumstances for\r\nsome time; but if the disease be cancer, a cure is hopeless without\r\ninstruments and scientific skill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I was the only wretched being in the colony,\" said Willis,\r\nsighing, \"but I find I am not alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no hopes of the _Nelson_, are there?\" inquired Becker.\r\n\r\n\"None now; for some time Mr. Wolston and yourself almost persuaded me\r\nthat she had escaped; but had she reached the Cape, we should have\r\nheard of her ere now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The probabilities of another vessel touching here are small, are they\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not in the direct track to anywhere; therefore, unless a ship\r\nhas been driven out of her course by a gale, there is not a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate that I am!\" exclaimed Becker, covering his face with his\r\nhands. \"Brutus, Manlius Torquatus, and Peter the Great, condemned\r\ntheir sons to death, but they were guilty; still the sacrifice must be\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nHere Willis stared aghast, and began to fear Becker's intellect had\r\nbeen affected by his troubles.\r\n\r\n\"I do not exactly understand you, Mr. Becker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two of my sons have gone on before us; they were to embark in the\r\ncanoe for Shark's Island, and wait for us there. I must have courage,\r\nand you also, Willis.\"\r\n\r\nThis exordium did not tend to alter the Pilot's impression. They\r\nwalked on for some time in silence towards the coast.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the latitude and longitude of this coast, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" thought the Pilot, \"he has changed the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we are in the South Sea, and no great distance from the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"What continent is nearest us?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot be very far off the south coast of New Holland, or, as it\r\nis named in some charts, Australia. You know that the _Nelson_ hailed\r\nfrom Botany Bay, or Sydney, as the convict colony which the English\r\nGovernment has just founded there is called.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far do you suppose we are from Sydney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say, with a fair wind and a smart craft, Sydney is not\r\nabove two months' sail, if so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the coast inhabited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What character do the inhabitants bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"According to the Dutch sailors, who have been on the coast, they are\r\nthe most plundering and lubberly set of rascals to be met with\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not acquainted with the use of fire-arms, are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No not of fire-arms; but they have a machine of their own that they\r\ncall a waddy, or something of that sort, which they throw like a\r\nharpoon; but the thing takes a twist in the air, and strikes behind\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the coast accessible?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it is fringed with reefs, and, in some places, the surf runs for\r\nmiles out to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The navigation along shore, then, is extremely perilous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever can he be driving at?\" thought Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; such a lee shore in a gale would terrify the Flying Dutchman\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nHere Becker shook his head dolefully, and they walked on a little\r\nfurther in silence.\r\n\r\n\"What islands do you suppose are nearest us, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say we are in or near the group marked in the chart\r\nPapuasia; beyond them is the territory of New Guinea, and a point to\r\nnor'ard are a whole nest of islands discovered by the celebrated\r\nbuccaneer, Dampière.\"\r\n\r\n\"And their inhabitants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some of them are pretty fair; but, taking them in the lump, they\r\nare a bad lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"The islands to the west are those discovered by Cook, Vancouver, and\r\nBougainville, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are marked Polynesia in the charts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know of any European settlements on these islands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is a fort of the Hudson's Bay Company on Vancouver's\r\nIsland, but that is a long way north; and, I believe, a factory has\r\nrecently been anchored in New Zealand, but that is a long way south.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are the principal islands between?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Friendly Islands, the\r\nSocieties' Islands, the Marquesas, Tahite, and the Pelew Islands; but\r\neach navigator gives them a new name, so that it is hard to say which\r\nis which; all you can do is to say that there is an island in latitude\r\nso and so and longitude so and so, but the name is almost out of the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the natives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of them are remarkably tame, and trade freely with strangers;\r\nbut others have strongly marked cannibal propensities, and dote upon a\r\nwhite-skin feast when they can get one.\"\r\n\r\nHere Becker shuddered, and uttered an exclamation of horror.\r\n\r\n\"That would be a terrible fate, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever can he mean?\" thought the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"Willis, to reach Europe from here, what course do you think would be\r\nbest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I think I shall fix him at last,\" said the Pilot, levelling his\r\nrifle at an imaginary bird.\r\n\r\n\"You will only waste gunpowder,\" said Becker; \"I see nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You asked me just now what course I should steer for Europe, did you\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the most direct course would be to make the Straits of\r\nMacassar, and then steer for Java.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would then be fifteen or sixteen hundred leagues from the Cape.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is about the distance in a straight line across the Indian\r\nOcean. When at the Cape, another fifteen days' sail will bring you to\r\nthe line; five or six weeks after that St. Helena will heave in sight;\r\nthen you fall in with the Island of Ascension; leaving which a week or\r\ntwo will bring you to the Straits of Gibraltar, where you get the\r\nfirst glimpse of Europe. But if you are bound for England, your\r\ndaughter may commence working a pair of slippers for you; they will be\r\nready by the time you get there.\"\r\n\r\nThey had now arrived at the point of the Jackal River where the\r\npinnace was moored.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of this boat?\" inquired Becker.\r\n\r\n\"The pinnace is well enough for fair weather; but it is not the sort\r\nof craft I should like to command in a storm at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that to venture to sea in it would be to incur imminent danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no denying that, Mr. Becker; if she shipped a moderately\r\nheavy sea, down she must go to the bottom, like a four and twenty\r\npound shot; and if she should spring a leak, you cannot land to put\r\nher to rights; the waves are by no means solid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I thought!\" exclaimed Becker; \"I was right in judging that it\r\nwould be a sacrifice. It is almost certain death; but they must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"To Europe if need be, if God in his mercy spares the pinnace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the means of purchasing surgical skill, and I must use all the\r\nsacrifices at my command to obtain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Avast heaving, Mr. Becker,\" cried Willis; \"now I understand; the\r\nthing is as clear as the tackle of the best bower, and when a\r\nresolution is once formed, nothing like paying it out at the word of\r\ncommand. When shall we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not talking of either you or myself, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom then, may I ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fritz and Jack. Fritz knows something of navigation; and if they\r\nsucceed, they will have saved their mother; if they perish, they will\r\nhave died to save her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fritz, as you say, does know something of navigation, particularly as\r\nregards coasting; but here you have a pilot, accustomed to salt water,\r\nquite handy, why not engage him also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willis, you have yourself said that the undertaking is perilous in\r\nthe extreme, and your life is not bound up like theirs in that of\r\ntheir mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but do you not see that I am sick of dry land, and that I am\r\ngetting rusty for the want of a little sea air?\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt ashamed to ask you to share in so desperate an enterprise,\r\notherwise I would have proposed it to you, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might have seen that I was growing thin, absolutely pining\r\naway, and drying up on land. There are ducks that can live without\r\nwater, but I am not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I, then, to understand that you offer to risk your life in this\r\nforlorn hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Becker; a man condemned to be hanged, running the risk\r\nof being drowned is no great sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willis, I accept your offer, to share in the dangers of this\r\nenterprise, most gratefully. I thank you in the name of my sons and of\r\ntheir mother, and trust that God may enable me to recompense you for\r\nyour devotion to them and to myself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" added Willis, wiping a tear from the corner of his\r\neye, that he ascribed to a grain of dust, \"you forget that I was on\r\nthe point of venturing out to sea in the canoe, had you yourself and\r\nMr. Wolston not prevented me. There is work to be done, I admit; and\r\nit is not impossible to cross even the Indian Ocean in the pinnace.\r\nBut we may find a doctor, perhaps, at some of the settlements--for\r\ninstance, at Manilla, in the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not to be hoped for, Willis; there is, probably, only one\r\nskilful medical man in each colony, and he will be prevented leaving\r\nby Government engagements.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; then we had better hoist sail for Europe direct, and trust to\r\nfalling in with a ship now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" sighed Becker, \"in a path so wide as the ocean, it would be\r\nunwise to trust to such chances; you will have to rely, I fear,\r\nentirely upon the resources of the pinnace alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I dare say, though we may have to put up with half rations, we\r\nshall not starve on the voyage, at all events.\"\r\n\r\nThey had unmoored the pinnace, and were on their way to Shark's\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n\"You are about to announce to your sons their departure?\" said Willis,\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but my heart almost fails me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The iron must be struck while it is hot. Will you commission me to\r\nwhisper a few words in their ear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Willis; but what right have I to expect courage from them, if\r\nI exhibit weakness myself? No, my friend, I may shed tears in your\r\npresence, but not before them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man ought never to allow his feelings to get the better of his\r\ncourage,\" said Willis, in whose eyes, however, the dust was evidently\r\nplaying sad havoc.\r\n\r\n\"These boys have almost never been absent from me. I have watched them\r\ngrow up from infancy to adolescence, and from adolescence to manhood;\r\nthey have always been dutiful and obedient, and with gratitude I have\r\nblessed them every night of their lives. But stern are the decrees of\r\nFate; I must command them to depart from me--perhaps for ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are evils that lead to good,\" said Willis, \"even though these\r\nevils be the Straits of Magellan or the storms of the Indian Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nHere the pinnace reached the offing of Shark's Island, where Fritz and\r\nJack, leaning on the battery, watched the progress of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Do you observe how downcast my father looks?\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Willis does not look much gayer,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in omens, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mark me, there is a screw loose somewhere, or I am no oracle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nBACON AND BISCUIT--LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE--THE PATERNAL BENEDICTION--AN\r\nAPPARITION--A MOTHER NOT EASILY DECEIVED--THE ADIEU--THE EMPEROR\r\nCONSTANTINE--IN HOC SIGNO VINCES--THE SAILOR'S POSTSCRIPT--CÆSAR AND\r\nHIS FORTUNES--RECOLLECTIONS--MRS. BECKER PLUCKS STOCKINGS AND KNITS\r\nORTOLANS--HOW DELIGHTFUL IT IS TO BE SCOLDED--THE BODIES VANISH, BUT\r\nTHE SOULS REMAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn their return from Shark's Island, Fritz and Jack were deeply\r\naffected, not by the dread of the perils they were destined to\r\nencounter--these never gave them a moment's uneasiness--but by the\r\nknowledge that a merciless vulture was preying upon the vitals of\r\ntheir beloved mother.\r\n\r\nWillis on the contrary, appeared as lively as if he had just received\r\nnotice of promotion; but whether the idea of again dwelling on the\r\nopen sea had really elevated his spirits, or whether this gaiety was\r\nonly assumed to encourage Becker and his sons, was best known to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged amongst them that no one, under any circumstances,\r\nshould be made acquainted with the design they had in contemplation.\r\nBy this means all opposition would be vanquished, and the regrets of\r\nseparation would, in some degree, be avoided. Besides, if the project\r\nwere divulged, might not Frank and Ernest insist upon their right to\r\nshare its dangers? This eventuality alone was sufficient to impress\r\nupon them all the urgency of secrecy. The really strong man knows his\r\nweakness, and therefore dislikes to run the risk of exposing it, so\r\nBecker dreaded the tears and entreaties that this desperate\r\nundertaking would inevitably exercise, were it generally known\r\nbeforehand to the rest of the family; whereas, if once the pinnace\r\nwere fairly at sea, it could not be recalled, and time would do the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSince, then, all the preparations had to be made in such a way as not\r\nto excite suspicion that any thing extraordinary was on foot, the\r\nprogress was necessarily slow. Willis, under pretext of amusing\r\nhimself, refitted the pinnace, and strengthened it so far as he could\r\nwithout impairing its sailing efficiency. He called to mind that, when\r\nCaptain Cook reached Batavia, after his first voyage round the world,\r\nhe observed with astonishment that a large portion of the sides of his\r\nfamous ship the _Endeavor_ was, under the water line, no thicker than\r\nthe sole of a shoe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather had settled, and the tropical heats set in, the\r\nWolstons resumed their abode at Falcon's Nest; whilst, under some\r\nplausible pretext or other, Willis, Fritz, and Jack took up their\r\nquarters at Rockhouse. This arrangement gave the destined navigators\r\nthe means of carrying on their operations unobserved, especially as\r\nregards salting provisions and baking for the voyage.\r\n\r\nAlong with the stores, a portion of the valuables, that still remained\r\nin the magazines of Rockhouse, were placed on board the pinnace; for,\r\nthough gold and precious stones were not of much value in New\r\nSwitzerland, Becker had not forgotten that such was not the case in\r\nother portions of the world; he reflected that his sons must be\r\nfurnished with the means of returning to the colony with comfort.\r\nThere was also a man of science and education to be bought, and that,\r\nhe knew, could not be done without as the French proverb has it,\r\nhaving some hay in one's boots.\r\n\r\nStorms are usually heralded by some premonitory symptoms: the\r\natmosphere becomes oppressive, the clouds increase in density, the sky\r\ngradually becomes obscure and large drops of rain begin to fall, then\r\nfollows the deluge, and the elements commence their strife. It is much\r\nthe same with impending misfortunes: gloom gathers on the countenance,\r\nour movements become constrained, our thoughts wander, and a tear\r\nlingers in the corner of the eye. Fritz and Jack endeavored in vain to\r\nappear unconcerned, but, in spite of their efforts, it was painfully\r\nevident that their minds were burdened by some heavy weight. They\r\nwere more tender and more affectionate, particularly towards their\r\nmother. Towards evening, when they quitted the family circle for\r\nRockhouse, their adieus were so earnest, so warm, and so often\r\nrepeated, that it almost appeared as if they were laying in a stock of\r\nthem for their voyage, to store up and preserve with the bacon and\r\nbiscuits. Even the animals came in for an extra share of caresses,\r\nand, if they were capable of reflection, it must have puzzled them\r\nsorely to account for all the endearments that were lavished upon them\r\nby the two brothers.\r\n\r\nBecker himself was no less affected than his sons; sometimes, when the\r\nlatter were busily occupied with some preparation for the voyage, he\r\nwould fix his eyes sadly upon them, just as if every trait of these\r\ncherished features had not already been deeply graven on his soul.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding rainy season, the two young men felt the days\r\nlong and tedious, and wished in their inmost hearts that they would\r\npass away more swiftly; now, the hours seemed to fly with\r\nunaccountable rapidity, and they would gladly have lengthened them if\r\nthey had had the power. But no one can arrest\r\n\r\n  Le temps, cette image mobile\r\n  De l'immobile éternité.\r\n\r\nAnd time is right in holding on the even tenor of its way; for if it\r\nonce yielded to the desires of mortals, there would be no end of\r\nconfusion and perplexity. It takes unto itself wings and flies away,\r\nsay the fortunate; it lags at a snail's pace, say the unfortunate. The\r\nidler knows not how to pass it away. The man of action does not\r\nobserve its progress. Those who are looking forward to some favorite\r\namusement exclaim, \"Would that it were to-morrow!\" but how many there\r\nare that might well ejaculate, from the bottom of their souls, \"Would\r\nthat to-morrow may never arrive!\" How, then, could such wishes be met\r\nin a way to satisfy all?\r\n\r\nA day at length arrived when everything was ready for departure, and\r\nwhen nothing was wanted to weigh anchor but courage on the part of\r\nthe voyagers. The pinnace was laden to the gunwale, the compass was in\r\nits place, the casks were filled with fresh water from the Jackal\r\nRiver, and Willis reported that both wind and sea were propitious for\r\na start.\r\n\r\nThe morning of that day was lovely in the extreme. Willis, Fritz, and\r\nJack were early at Falcon's Nest; the two families breakfasted\r\ntogether under the trees in the open air. After breakfast an\r\nadjournment to the umbrageous shade of the bananas was proposed and\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said Fritz, taking Mrs. Becker's arm, \"I want you all to\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I object to that, if you please,\" cried Jack, taking her other arm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you boys seem extravagantly fond of your mother to-day,\" said\r\nMrs. Becker, gaily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, mother, we have the right to have an idea now and\r\nthen--Willis has one every week.\"\r\n\r\n\"So long as your ideas are about myself, I have no reason to object to\r\nthem,\" said Mrs. Becker, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"We have always been dutiful sons, have we not, mother?\" inquired\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, always.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are well pleased with us then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, surely.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have never caused you any uneasiness, have we?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, inadvertently,\" added Fritz; \"designedly is out of\r\nthe question.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not even inadvertently,\" replied their mother.\r\n\r\n\"Were you very sorry when Frank and Ernest were going to leave us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my children, the tears still burn my cheek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, you knew that it was for the common welfare, and you\r\nfelt resigned to the separation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do you ask such a question now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, _à propos de rien_, mother,\" replied Jack, \"simply because we\r\nlove you, and, like misers, we treasure your love.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the afternoon both families were again assembled under the\r\ntrees at Falcon's Nest This time it was dinner that brought them\r\ntogether; the repast consisted of cold meats of various kinds, but the\r\nchief dish was a wonderful salad, the rich, fresh odor of which\r\nperfumed the air. Wolston, Frank, and Ernest kept up a lively\r\nconversation, yet, though all seemed happy and pleased, there were\r\nbursting hearts at the table that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to take a turn in the pinnace to-morrow,\" said Willis,\r\nquietly; \"who will go with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" cried all the four brothers.\r\n\r\n\"I shall require you, Frank and Ernest, to take a look at the rice\r\nplantation to-morrow,\" said Becker, \"so I wish you to put off the\r\nexcursion till another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are at your orders, father,\" replied the two young men.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Willis?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am anxious to discover whether we inhabit an island or a\r\ncontinent, and may, consequently, extend the survey beyond the points\r\nalready known; so you must not be disappointed should we not return\r\nthe same night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the good of such an expedition?\" inquired Mrs. Becker.\r\n\r\n\"The country may be inhabited, or there may be inhabited islands in\r\nthe vicinity,\" replied Willis.\r\n\r\n\"If there be natives anywhere near,\" said Mrs. Becker, \"they have left\r\nus at peace hitherto, and, in my opinion, since the dog sleeps, it\r\nwill be prudent for us to let it lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a question of creating any inconvenience,\" suggested\r\nBecker, \"but only to ascertain more accurately our geographical\r\nposition: such a knowledge can do us no possible harm, but, some day,\r\nit may be of immense service to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if you should fall in with a ship?\" inquired Mrs. Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"In that case we shall give your compliments to the commander,\"\r\nreplied Jack.\r\n\r\n\"You may do that if you like, but try and bring it back with you if\r\nyou can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to leave us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean that,\" hastily added Mrs. Wolston, \"but I am beginning\r\nto get anxious about my son, poor fellow. If the _Nelson_ has not\r\narrived at the Cape, then he will suppose we are all drowned, and I\r\nshould like to fall in with some means of assuring him of our safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" cried the two girls, \"do try and fall in with a ship; our\r\npoor brother will be so wretched.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might say our brother as well,\" added the two young men.\r\n\r\nHere the two mothers interchanged a glance of intelligence, which\r\nmight mean very little, but which likewise might signify a great deal.\r\n\r\nA moment of intense anxiety had now arrived for Becker and his two\r\nsons; they could scarcely refrain from shedding tears, but they felt\r\nthat the slightest imprudence of that nature would divulge everything.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, my lads, look alive,\" cried Willis, in a voice which he\r\nmeant to be gruff; \"if you intend to take a few hours' repose before\r\nwe start in the morning, it is time to be off.\"\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack, had it been to save their lives, could not now have\r\nhelped throwing more than usual energy into their parting embraces\r\nthat particular afternoon; but they passed through the ordeal with\r\ntolerable firmness, and then with heavy hearts turned towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"I think I will walk with you as far as Rockhouse,\" said Becker.\r\n\r\nAll four then departed; and when the party were about fifty yards from\r\nFalcon's Nest, Fritz and Jack turned round and waved a final adieu to\r\nthose loved beings whom probably, they might never see again.\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" said Becker. \"I am satisfied with your conduct\r\nthroughout this trying interval.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now an hour when there is something indescribably sombre about\r\nthe country; day was declining, the outlines of the larger objects in\r\nthe landscape were becoming less distinct, and the trees were assuming\r\nany sort of fantastical shape that the mind chose to assign to them.\r\nHere and there a bird rustled in the foliage, but otherwise the\r\nsilence was only broken by footsteps of the four men.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary life children quit the parental home by easy and almost\r\nimperceptible gradations. First, there is the school, then college;\r\nnext, perhaps, the requirements of the profession they have adopted.\r\nThus they readily abandon the domestic hearth; friends, intercourse,\r\nand society divide their affection, and the separation from home\r\nrarely, if ever, costs them a pang. Not so with Becker's two sons;\r\ntheir world was New Switzerland; therefore, like the rays of the sun\r\nabsorbed by the mirror of Archimedes, all their affections were\r\nconcentrated on one point.\r\n\r\nOn the former occasion when the family ties were on the eve of being\r\nrent asunder, the case was very different. It is true, Frank and\r\nErnest were about to leave for an indefinite period of time; but then,\r\nevery comfort that the most fastidious voyager could desire was\r\nawaiting them on board the _Nelson_; for a well-appointed ship is like\r\na well-appointed inn on shore, all your wants are ministered to with\r\nthe utmost celerity. Besides, Captain Littlestone had taken the young\r\nmen under his special protection, and had promised to see them\r\nproperly introduced and cared for in Europe. How dissimilar was the\r\nposition of Fritz and his brother; they were about to tumble into the\r\nold world should they be so fortunate as to reach it, much as if they\r\nhad dropped from the skies, without a guide and without a friend. They\r\nwere about to entrust themselves to the ocean, separated from its\r\ntreacherous floods by a few wretched planks; to be exposed for months,\r\nalmost unsheltered, to wind, rain, and the mercy of pitiless storms.\r\n\r\n\"If God in His mercy preserves you, my sons,\" said Becker, breaking at\r\nlast the silence, \"you will find yourselves launched in an ocean still\r\nmore turbulent than that you have escaped--an ocean where falsehood\r\nand cunning assume the names of policy and tact; where results always\r\njustify the means, whatever these may be; where everything is\r\nsacrificed to personal interest and ambition; where fortune is honored\r\nas a virtue that dispenses with all others, and where profligacies of\r\nthe most odious kinds are decorated with gay and seductive colors. It\r\nis difficult for me to foresee the various circumstances amidst which\r\nyou may be placed; but there are certain rules of conduct that\r\nprovide for nearly every emergency. I have no need to urge loyalty or\r\ncourage--these qualities are inseparable from your hearts. Strive only\r\nfor what is just and honest. Submit to be cheated rather than be\r\ncheats yourselves; ill-gotten gains never made any one rich. Put your\r\ntrust in Providence. Seek aid from on high, when you find yourselves\r\nsurrounded with difficulties. Never forget that there is no corner on\r\nthe earth's surface, however obscure, that the eyes of the Lord are\r\nnot there to behold your actions. Act promptly and with energy. Bear\r\nin mind that every moment lost will be to your mother an age of\r\nsuffering, and that her life is suspended on the fragile thread of\r\nyour return.\"\r\n\r\nThe party had now reached the banks of the Jackal River, where the\r\npinnace was moored. Fritz and Jack were shedding tears unrestrainedly,\r\nand had dropped on their knees at their father's feet.\r\n\r\n\"I call,\" said Becker, in a trembling voice, \"the benediction of\r\nHeaven upon your heads, my sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but they must not go!\" cried Mrs. Becker, rushing out from behind\r\nsome tall brushwood that hid her from their view; \"they shall not go!\"\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were instantly inclosed within their mother's arms.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried she, pushing aside the hair from their brows, the better\r\nto observe their features, \"you thought to deceive your mother, did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon!\" exclaimed both the young men.\r\n\r\nHere Becker thought it necessary to interfere; and, summoning all the\r\ncourage he could muster to the task, said--\r\n\r\n\"Why should they not go? Is this the first expedition they have\r\nundertaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not the first expedition they have undertaken, but it is\r\nthe first time their eyes and their looks betokened an eternal adieu.\r\nIt is the first time that I felt they were forsaking me for ever, and\r\nit is the first time you ever addressed them with the words you just\r\nnow uttered.\"\r\n\r\nBecker saw that it was useless to attempt to carry deceit any\r\nfurther; he therefore withdrew his eyes from the piercing glance of\r\nhis wife. Willis, caught in the act, as it were, was completely thrown\r\noff his guard, and had not a word to say for himself. Fritz and Jack\r\nhad again fallen on their knees, this time at the feet of their\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I begin to understand,\" she screamed, as she glanced around on\r\nthe scared group that surrounded her, like a wounded lioness whose\r\ncubs were being carried off; \"now the bandage begins to drop from my\r\neyes. A thousand inexplicable things dart into my mind. You are\r\nsending the boys on an impracticable voyage to secure the safety of\r\ntheir mother; but you did not think that in order to prolong my\r\nexistence for a few years, you would kill me instantly with grief!\r\nWhat right have you to impose a remedy upon me that is a thousand\r\ntimes worse than the malady? Have I ever complained? May my sufferings\r\nnot be agreeable to me? May I not like them? Is pain and suffering not\r\nour lot from the cradle to the tomb? But I am not ill, I was never\r\nbetter in my life than I am at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nHere she was seized with a paroxysm of nervous tremors that convulsed\r\nher frame most fearfully, and completely belied her words. Becker\r\nrushed forward and held her firmly in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"God give me strength!\" he murmured. \"Go, my children, where your duty\r\ncalls you; go, my friend, do not prolong this terrible scene an\r\ninstant longer.\"\r\n\r\nNot another word was spoken, the pinnace was unmoored; Fritz, Jack,\r\nand Willis embarked. When at some little distance from the shore,\r\nthere was just light enough for Fritz to notice that his father was\r\ndirecting the feeble steps of his mother in the direction of Falcon's\r\nNest. In a few moments more all the objects on shore were one confused\r\nmass of unfathomable shadow. The pinnace dropped anchor at Shark's\r\nIsland, where some few final preparations for the voyage had to be\r\nmade. Fritz here took a pen and wrote:\r\n\r\n\"We part. We are gone. When you read this letter, the sea, for some\r\ndistance, will extend between us. We shall live and move elsewhere,\r\nbut our hearts still with you. We wish that Ernest and Frank would\r\nerect a flagstaff on the spot where we last parted with our parents.\r\nIt may be to us what the celestial standard bearing the scroll, _in\r\nhoc signo vinces_ was to the Emperor Constantine. The place is already\r\nsacred, and may be hallowed by your prayers for us. Our confidence in\r\nthe divine mercy is boundless. Do not despair of seeing us again. We\r\nhave no misgivings, not one of us but anticipates confidently the\r\nperiod when we shall return and bring with us health, happiness, and\r\nprosperity to you all.\r\n\r\n\"Let me add a word,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"The sea is calm, our hearts are firm, our enterprise is under the\r\nprotection of Heaven--there never was an undertaking commenced under\r\nmore favorable auspices. Farewell then, once more, farewell. All our\r\naspirations are for you.\r\n\r\n\"FRITZ.\r\n\r\n\"JACK.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--Willis was going to write a line or two when, lo and behold! a\r\nbig tear rolled upon the paper. 'Ha!' said he, 'that is enough, I will\r\nnot write a word, they will understand that, I think,' and he threw\r\ndown the pen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is the letter to be sent on shore?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"There is a cage of pigeons on board the pinnace,\" replied Jack, \"but\r\nI do not want them to know that, for, if they should expect to hear\r\nfrom us, and some accident happen to the pigeons, they might be\r\ndreadfully disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can return on shore,\" observed Willis, \"and place it on the spot,\r\nwhere we embarked; they are sure to be there to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was incontinently adopted. The letter was attached to\r\na small cross, and fixed in the ground. The voyagers had all\r\nre-embarked in the pinnace, which was destined to bear even more than\r\nCæsar and his fortunes. Willis had already loosened the warp, when, a\r\nthought crossed the mind of Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"I must revisit Falcon's Nest once more,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Willis, \"you are not going to get up such another scene\r\nas we witnessed an hour or two ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Willis, I mean to go by stealth like the Indian trapper, so as to\r\nbe seen by no mortal eye. I wish to take one more look at the old\r\nfamiliar trees, and endeavor to ascertain whether my mother has\r\nreached home in safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the dogs?\" objected Willis.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs know me too well to give the slightest alarm at my approach.\r\nI shall not be long gone; but really I must go, the desire is too\r\npowerful within me to be resisted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nHere Willis shook his head and reflected an instant.\r\n\r\n\"You are not angry with us, Willis, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" he replied, \"and I think the best thing I can do, under\r\nthe circumstances, is to go too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, make fast that warp again, and come along.\"\r\n\r\nThe party then disappeared amongst the brushwood.\r\n\r\n\"Some time ago,\" remarked Fritz, \"we followed this track about the\r\nsame hour; there was danger to be apprehended, but the enterprise was\r\nbloodless, though successful.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the chimpanzee affair,\" said Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; this time we have only an emotion to conquer, but I am afraid it\r\nis too strong for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are the trees,\" said Jack, as they debouched upon the road,\r\n\"that I stuck my proclamations upon. We had very little to think of in\r\nthose days.\"\r\n\r\nAs the party drew near Falcon's Nest, the dogs approached and welcomed\r\nthem with the usual canine demonstrations of joy.\r\n\r\n\"I have half a mind to carry off Toby,\" said Fritz; \"but I fear Mary\r\nwould miss him.\"\r\n\r\nExternally all appeared tranquil at Falcon's Nest; this satisfied the\r\nyoung men that their mother had succeeded in reaching home, at least,\r\nin safety; a light streaming through the window of Becker's dwelling,\r\nhowever, showed that the family had not yet retired for the night.\r\n\r\n\"If they only knew we were so near them!\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\nThe entire party then sat down upon a rustic bench, shrouded with\r\nflowering orchis and Spanish jasmine.\r\n\r\n\"How often, on returning from the fields or the chase, we have seen\r\nour mother at work on this very seat,\" observed Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" added Jack; \"once I observed she had fallen asleep whilst\r\nknitting stockings. I advanced on tip-toe, removed gently her knitting\r\napparatus, stockings, and all, and placed on her lap some ortolans\r\nthat I had caught and strangled; but I first plucked one of them, and\r\nscattered the feathers all about, and then retreated into a thicket to\r\nwatch the _dénouement_ of my scheme. She awoke, put down her hand to\r\ntake up a stocking, and laid hold of a bird. She stared, rubbed her\r\neyes, stared again, looked about, and could find nothing but the\r\nortolan feathers. I then ran forward and embraced her, looking as if I\r\nhad just come from unearthing turnips. 'Well, I declare,' she said\r\nwith a bewildered air, 'I could have sworn that I was knitting just\r\nnow, and here I find myself plucking ortolans; and what is more, I\r\nhave not the slightest idea where, in all the world, the birds have\r\ncome from!' Of course, I looked as innocent as possible; so that the\r\nmore she stared and reflected, the less she could make the matter out.\r\nAt last, she went on plucking the birds, and when this was done she\r\nstuck them on the spit. When the ortolans were roasted and ready to be\r\nserved up, I went into the kitchen, carried them off, and put my\r\nmother's knitting apparatus on the spit. Imagine her surprise when she\r\nbeheld her worsted and stockings at the fire, knowing, at the same\r\ntime, that four hungry stomachs were waiting for their dinners! At\r\nlast, fearing that she was going to ascribe the metamorphosis to some\r\nhallucination of her own, I went up to her, threw my arms round her\r\nneck, told her the whole story, and we both of us enjoyed a hearty\r\nlaugh over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, Jack, those were laughing times,\" said Fritz, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Not only that, but our mother was always so even--tempered; she was\r\nnever ruffled in the slightest degree by my nonsense; though she often\r\nhad the right to be very angry, yet she never once took offence. On\r\nanother occasion, Mary and Sophia Wolston were working here at those\r\nmysterious embroideries which they always hid when we came near.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toby's collar, I suppose,\" remarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"My tobacco pouch,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"I approached,\" continued Jack, \"with the muffled softness of a cat,\r\nand was just on the point of discovering their secret, when my monkey,\r\nKnips, who was cracking nuts at their feet, made a spring, and drew a\r\nbobbin of silk after it; this caused them to look round, and great was\r\nmy astonishment to find myself caught at the very moment I expected to\r\nsurprise them. They commenced scolding me at an immense rate, but then\r\nit was so delightful to be scolded!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" murmured Fritz, \"that is all over now.\"\r\n\r\nLike a file of sheep, one recollection dragged another after it, so\r\nthat the whole of the past recurred to their memories. Some faint\r\nstreaks of light now warned them that day was about to break; the\r\ncocks began to crow one after the other, and to fill the air with\r\ntheir shrill voices.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Willis, \"it is high time to be off.\"\r\n\r\nJack hastily gathered two bouquets of flowers, which he suspended to\r\nthe lintel of each dwelling.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" said he, \"will show them that we have paid them another\r\nvisit.\"\r\n\r\nThey then bent down all three on their knees, uttered a short prayer,\r\nand afterwards disappeared amidst the shadows of the chestnut trees.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said Willis, seeing that his companions were about to make a\r\nhalt, \"if you stop again, or speak of returning any more, I will cease\r\nto regard you as men.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards, on the morning of the 8th March, 1812, the\r\npinnace bore out to sea, and when day broke, the crew could not descry\r\na single trace of New Switzerland on any point of the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nEIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE--THE MARY--COUNT UGOLINO--THE\r\nSOURCES OF RIVERS--THE ALPS DEMOLISHED--NO MORE PYRENEES--THE\r\nFIRST SHIP--ADMIRAL NOAH--FLEETS OF THE ISRAELITES--THE\r\nCOMPASS--PRINTING--GUNPOWDER--ACTIUM AND SALAMIS--DIDO AND\r\nAENEAS--STEAM--DON GARAY AND ROGER BACON--MELCHTHAL, FURST, AND\r\nWILLIAM TELL--GOING A-PLEASURING--UPSET VERSUS BLOWN UP--A DEAD\r\nCALM--THE LOG--WILLIS'S ARCHIPELAGO--THE ISLAND OF SOPHIA--THE BREAD\r\nFRUIT-TREE--NATIVES OF POLYNESIA--STRIPED TROWSERS--ABDUCTION OF\r\nWILLIS--IS HE TO BE ROASTED OR BOILED?--WHEN THE WINE IS POURED OUT,\r\nWE MUST DRINK IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the date of the events narrated in the preceeding chapter,\r\ncomparatively little was known of Oceania, that is, of the islands and\r\ncontinents that are scattered about the Pacific Ocean. Most of them\r\nhad been discovered, named, and marked correctly enough in the charts,\r\nbut beyond this all was supposition, hypothesis, and mystery. The\r\nmighty empire of England in the east was then only in its infancy,\r\nSutteeism and Thuggism were still rampant on the banks of the Ganges,\r\nbut the power of the descendants of the Great Mogul was on the wane.\r\nCalifornia was only known as the hunting-ground of a savage race of\r\nwild Indians. The now rich and flourishing colonies of Australia were\r\nrepresented by the convict settlement of Sydney. The Dutch had\r\nasserted that the territory of New Holland was utterly uninhabitable,\r\nand this was still the belief of the civilized world; nor was it\r\nwithout considerable opposition on the part of _soi-disant_\r\nphilanthropists that the English government succeeded in establishing\r\na prison depot on what at the time was considered the sole spot in\r\nthat vast territory susceptible of cultivation. At the present time,\r\nthese formerly-despised regions send _one hundred tons of pure gold_\r\nto England. The political state of Europe itself had at this time\r\nassumed a singular aspect. Napoleon had made himself master of nearly\r\nall the continental states; Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, and a\r\npart of Germany were at his feet; and, by the Peace of Tilsit, he had\r\nsecured the coõperation of Alexander, Emperor of Russia, in his\r\nschemes to ruin the trade and commerce of Great Britain. England, by\r\nher opportune seizure of the Danish fleet, broke up the first great\r\nnorthern confederacy that was formed against her. This act, though\r\nmuch impugned by the politicians of the day, is now known not only to\r\nhave been perfectly justifiable, but also highly creditable to the\r\npolitical foresight of Canning and Castlereagh, by whom it was\r\nsuggested, to say nothing of the daring and boldness that Nelson\r\ndisplayed in executing the manoeuvre. When news of this event reached\r\nthe Russian Emperor it threw him into a paroxysm of rage, and he\r\ndeclared war against England in violent language. He had the insolence\r\nto make peace with France the _sina qua non_ of his friendship. At the\r\ndistance of nearly half a century, the actual language employed has a\r\npeculiar flavor. The emperor, after detailing his grievances, declares\r\nthat henceforth there shall be no connection between the two\r\ncountries, and calls on his Britannic Majesty to dismiss his\r\nministers, and conclude a peace forthwith. The British Government\r\nreplied to this by ordering Nelson to set sail forthwith for the mouth\r\nof the Neva. A bitter and scorching manifesto was at the time\r\nforwarded to the emperor. It accused him flatly of duplicity, and\r\nboldly defied him and all his legions. The whole document is well\r\nworthy of perusal in these lackadaisical times. It is dated\r\nWestminister, December 18, 1807. It sets forth anew the principles of\r\nmaritime war, which England had then rigidly in force. Napoleon had\r\ndeclared the whole of the British Islands in a state of blockade. The\r\nBritish Government replied by blockading _de facto_ the whole of\r\nEurope. This was done by those celebrated orders in council, which,\r\nmore than anything else, precipitated the downfall of Napoleon. They\r\nthrew the trade of the world into the hands of England. Of course,\r\nRussia was deeply affected, so was Spain and all the other maritime\r\nstates; and they were all, one way or another, in open hostility with\r\nthis country. But England laughed all their threats to scorn; and in\r\nthe whole history of the country, there was not a more brilliant\r\nperiod in her eventful history. She stood alone against the world in\r\narms. Even the blusterings of the United States were unheeded, and in\r\nno degree disturbed her stern equanimity. She saw the road to victory,\r\nand resolved to pursue it. But England then had great statesmen, and,\r\nof them all, Lord Castlereagh was the greatest, although he served a\r\nPrince Regent who cared no more for England or the English people,\r\nthan the Irish member, who, when reproached for selling his country,\r\nthanked God that he had a country to sell.\r\n\r\nAt length the ill-will of the Americans resolved itself into open\r\nwarfare, and the United States was numbered with the overt enemies of\r\nEngland. This resulted in British troops marching up to Washington and\r\nburning the Capitol, or Congress House, about the ears of the members\r\nwho had stirred up the strife. Meanwhile, all the islands of France in\r\nthe east and west had been taken possession of; the British flag waved\r\non the Spanish island of Cuba, and in the no less valuable possessions\r\nof Holland, in Java. Everywhere on the ocean England held undisputed\r\nsway. This state of things gave rise to one great evil--the sea\r\nswarmed with cruisers and privateers, English, French, and American;\r\nso that no vessel, unless sailing under convoy, heavily armed, or a\r\nvery swift sailer, but ran risk of capture.\r\n\r\nThe _Mary_--for so Fritz now called the pinnace--had been ten days at\r\nsea, the wind had died away, and for some time scarcely a zephyr had\r\nruffled the surface of the water, the sails were lazily flapping\r\nagainst the mast, and but for the currents, the voyagers would have\r\nbeen almost stationary. It may readily be supposed that, under such\r\ncircumstances, their progress was somewhat slow, and, as Jack\r\nobserved, to judge from their actual rate of sailing, they ought to\r\nhave started when very young, in order to arrive at the termination of\r\nthe voyage before they became bald-headed old men.\r\n\r\nThey prayed for a breeze, a gale, or even a storm; their fresh water\r\nwas beginning to get sour, and they reflected that, if the calm\r\ncontinued any length of time, their provisions would eventually run\r\nshort, and the ordinary resource of eating one another would stare\r\nthem in the face. Jack, being the youngest, would probably disappear\r\nfirst, next Fritz, then Willis would be left to eat himself, in order\r\nto avoid dying of hunger, just as the unfortunate Count Ugolino\r\ndevoured his own children to save them from orphanage.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, there were no symptoms of such a dire disaster; they\r\nwere in excellent health and tolerable spirits; they had provisions\r\nenough to last them for six months at least, and consequently had not\r\nas yet, at all events, the slightest occasion to manifest a tendency\r\nto anthropophagism.\r\n\r\n\"I can understand the sea,\" remarked Jack, \"as I understand the land\r\nand the sky; God created them, that is enough; but I cannot understand\r\nhow a mighty river like the Nile or the Ganges can continue eternally\r\ndischarging immense deluges of water into the sea without becoming\r\nexhausted. From what fathomless reservoirs do the Amazon and the\r\nMississippi receive their endless torrents?\"\r\n\r\n\"The reservoirs of the greatest rivers,\" replied Fritz, \"are nothing\r\nmore than drops of water that fall from the crevice of some rock on or\r\nnear the summit of a hill; these are collected together in a pool or\r\nhollow, from which they issue in the form of a slender rivulet. At\r\nfirst, the smallest pebble is sufficient to arrest the course of this\r\nthread of water; but it turns upon itself, gathers strength, finally\r\nsurmounts the obstacle, dashes over it, unites itself with other\r\nrivulets, reaches the plain, scoops out a bed, and goes on, as you\r\nsay, for ever emptying its waters into the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but it is the source of these sources that I want to know the\r\norigin of. You speak of hills, whilst we know that water naturally, by\r\nreason of its weight and fluidity; seeks to secrete itself in the\r\nlowest beds of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that water may come down\r\na hill, although it never goes up. Rain, snow, dew, and generally all\r\nthe vapors that fall from the atmosphere, furnish the enormous masses\r\nof water that are constantly flowing into the sea. The vapor alone\r\nthat is absorbed in the air from the sea is more than sufficient to\r\nfeed all the rivers on the face of the earth. Mountains, by their\r\nformation, arrest these vapors, collect them in a hole here and in a\r\ncavern there, and permit them to filter by a million of threads from\r\nrock to rock, fertilizing the land and nourishing the rivers that\r\nintersect it. If, therefore, you were to suppress the Alps that rise\r\nbetween France and Italy, you would, at the same time, extinguish the\r\nRhone and the Po.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a pity to do that,\" said Jack; \"there was a time though\r\nwhen there were no Pyrenees.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must have been, then, at a period prior to the formation of\r\ngranite, which is esteemed the oldest of rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"No such thing,\" insisted Jack; \"it was so late as 1713, when, by the\r\npeace of Utrecht, the crown of Spain was secured to the Duke of Anjou,\r\ngrandson of Louis XIV.\"\r\n\r\n\"Howsomever,\" remarked Willis, \"all the mariners in the French fleet\r\ncould not convince me that the Pyrenean mountains are only a hundred\r\nyears old.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother is only speaking metaphorically,\" said Fritz; \"when the\r\ncrown of Spain was assigned to the Duke of Anjou, his grandfather\r\nsaid--_Qu il n'y avait plus de Pyrénées_. He meant by that simply,\r\nthat France and Spain being governed by the same prince, the moral\r\nbarrier between them existed no longer. The formidable mountains still\r\nstood for all that, and he who removes them would certainly be\r\npossessed of extraordinary power.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am always putting my foot in it,\" said Willis, \"when the yarn is\r\nabout the land; let us talk of the sea for a bit. Who built the first\r\nship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Fritz, \"I should say that the first ship was the ark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence we may infer,\" added Jack, \"that Noah was the first admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"We learn from the Scriptures,\" continued Fritz, \"that the first\r\nnavigators were the children of Noah, and it appears from profane\r\nhistory that the earliest attempts at navigation were manifested near\r\nwhere the ark rested; consequently, we may fairly presume that the art\r\nof ship-building arose from the traditions of the deluge and the ark.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, the art in question dates very far back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, since it dates from 2348 years before the birth of Christ; but\r\nthe human race degenerated, the traditions were forgotten, and\r\nnavigation was confined to planks, rafts, bark canoes, or the trunk of\r\na tree hollowed out by fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the sort of craft used by the inhabitants of Polynesia at the\r\npresent day,\" remarked Willis.\r\n\r\n\"It appears, however, by the Book of Job, that pirates existed in\r\nthose days, and that they went to sea in ships and captured\r\nmerchantmen, which proves, to a certain extent, that there were\r\nmerchantmen to conquer. We know also that David and Solomon equipped\r\nlarge fleets, and even fought battles on sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether an ancient or modern, a Jew or a Gentile,\" said Willis, \"he\r\nmust have been a brave fellow who launched the first ship, and risked\r\nhimself and his goods at sea in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" continued Fritz; \"but when once the equilibrium of a floating\r\nbody was known, there would be no longer any risk; as soon as it came\r\nto be understood that any solid body would float if it were lighter\r\nthan its bulk of water, the matter was simple enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" interrupted Jack; \"but the words 'when' and 'as soon as'\r\nimply a great deal; _when_, or _as soon as_, we know anything, the\r\nmystery of course disappears. But before! there is the difficulty.\r\nParticles of water do not cohere--how is it, then, that a ship of war,\r\nthat often weighs two millions of pounds, does not sink through them,\r\nand go to the bottom? Individuals, like myself for example, who are\r\nnot members of a learned society, may be pardoned for not knowing how\r\nwater bears the weight of a seventy-four.\"\r\n\r\n\"The seventy-four would, most undoubtedly, sink if it were heavier\r\nthan the weight of water it displaced; but this is not the case; wood\r\nis generally lighter than water.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wood, yes; but the cannon, the cargo, and the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget the cabooses, the cockpits, and the cabins, that do not\r\nweigh anything. Allowing for everything, the weight of a ship, cargo\r\nand all, is much lighter than its bulk of water, and consequently it\r\ncannot sink.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is it, then, that the immense bulk of a seventy-four moves so\r\neasily in the water? One would think that its prodigious weight would\r\nmake it stick fast, and continue immoveable.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the seventy-four in question has displaced its weight of water,\r\nits own weight is substituted for the water, and is in consequence\r\nvirtually annihilated; it does not, in point of fact, weigh anything\r\nat all, and therefore is easily impelled by the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"When there is any, understood,\" added Jack.\r\n\r\n\"And a yard or so of canvas,\" suggested Willis.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" continued Fritz, \"a sail or two would be very desirable; these\r\ninstruments of propulsion do not appear, however, to have been used by\r\nthe ancients. We first hear of a sail being employed at the time when\r\nIsis went in search of her husband Osiris, who was killed by his\r\nbrother Typhon, and whose quarters were scattered in the Nile. This\r\nlady, it seems, took off the veil that covered her head, and fastened\r\nit to an upright shaft stuck in the middle of the boat, and, much to\r\nher astonishment, it impelled her onwards at a marvellous speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"A clever young woman that,\" said Willis; \"but I doubt whether veils\r\nwould answer the purpose on board a seventy-four, particularly as\r\nregards the mainsail and mizentops.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Phoenicians were the most enterprising of the early navigators.\r\nThey appeared to have sailed round Africa without a compass, for they\r\nembarked on the Red Sea and reappeared at the mouth of the Nile, and\r\nthe compass was not invented till the fourteenth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who was the inventor of the compass?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"According to some authorities, it was invented by a Neapolitan named\r\nJean Goya; according to others, the inventor was a certain Hugues de\r\nBercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Jack, \"you do not admit the claims of the Chinese and\r\nHindoos, who assert priority in the discovery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither deny nor admit their claims, because I do not know the\r\ngrounds upon which they are founded; like the invention of gunpowder\r\nand printing, the discovery of the compass has many rival claimants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of opinion,\" said Jack, \"that Guttenberg is entitled to the\r\nhonor of discovering printing, and that Berthold Schwartz invented\r\ngunpowder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right; but there is scarcely any invention of\r\nimportance that has not two or three names fastened to it as\r\ninventors; they stick to it like barnacles, and there is no way to\r\nshake any of them off. So, in the case of illustrious men, nations\r\ndispute the honor of giving them birth; there are six or seven towns\r\nin Asia Minor that claim to be the birth-place of Homer. National\r\nvanities justly desire to possess the largest amount of genius; hence,\r\nno sooner does anything useful make its appearance in the world, than\r\nhalf a dozen nations or individuals start up to claim it as their\r\noffspring. The wisest course, under such circumstances, is to side\r\nwith the best accredited opinion, which I have done in the case of the\r\ncompass.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was no joke,\" said Willis, \"to circumnavigate Africa without a\r\ncompass.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, Willis, if you judge the navigation of those\r\ndays by the modern standard; but it is to be borne in mind that the\r\nancients never lost sight of the coast. They steered from cape to\r\npromontory, and from promontory to cape, dropping their anchor every\r\nnight and remaining well in-shore till morning. If by accident they\r\nwere driven out into the open sea, and the stars happened to be hidden\r\nby fog or clouds, they were lost beyond recovery, even though within a\r\nday's sail of a harbor; because, whilst supposing they were making for\r\nthe coast, they might, in all probability, be steering in precisely\r\nthe opposite direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly marvellous,\" said Jack, \"that a piece of iron stuck\r\nupon a board should be a safe and sure guide to the mariner through\r\nthe trackless ocean, even when the stars are enveloped in obscurity\r\nand darkness!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a symbol of faith,\" remarked Willis, \"that supplies the doubts\r\nand incertitudes of reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the ships, or rather galleys, of the ancients,\" continued\r\nFritz, \"with the exception of the ambitious fleets of the Greeks and\r\nRomans that fought at Salamis and Actium, one of the modern ships of\r\nwar could sweep them all out of the sea with its rudder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, \"at the period of which you speak, the ancients\r\npossessed a great advantage over us. The winds in those days were\r\npersonages, and were very well known; they were called Aeolus, Boreas,\r\nand so forth. They were to be found in caves or islands, and, if\r\ntreated with civility, were remarkably condescending. Queen Dido,\r\nthrough one of these potentates, obtained contrary winds, to prevent\r\nAeneas from leaving her.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Willis, \"there is, or at least was, in one of the\r\nScottish rivers, a ship without either oars or sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very likely; but it did not move.\"\r\n\r\n\"It did though, and, what is more, against both wind and tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had your wonderful ship here just now, it is just the thing\r\nto suit us under present circumstances,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"So it would, Master Jack, for it sails against currents, up rivers,\r\nand the crew care no more about the wind than I do about the color of\r\nthe clouds when I am lighting my pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't happen to mean that the _Flying Dutchman_ has appeared on\r\nthe Scotch coast, do you, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, I mean just exactly what I say. It is a real ship,\r\nwith a real stern and a real figure-head, but manned by blacksmiths\r\ninstead of mariners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but how does it move? Does somebody go behind and push it, or\r\nis it dragged in front by sea-horses and water-kelpies?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it moves by steam.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, there lies the mystery. The affair has often been discussed by\r\nus sailors on board ship; some have suggested one way and some\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither of which throws much light on the subject,\" observed Jack;\r\n\"at least, in so far as we are concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I can tell you,\" said Willis, \"is, that the steam is obtained by\r\nboiling water in a large cauldron, and that the power so obtained is\r\nvery powerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"That it certainly is, if it could be controlled, for steam occupies\r\nseventeen or eighteen hundred times the space of the water in its\r\nliquid state; but then, if the vessel that contains the boiling water\r\nhas no outlet, the steam will burst it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears that it can be prevented doing that, though,\" replied\r\nWillis, \"even though additional heat be applied to the vapor itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"By heating the steam, the vapor may acquire a volume forty thousand\r\ntimes greater than that of the water; all that is well known; but as\r\nsoon as it comes in contact with the air, nothing is left of it but a\r\ncloud, which collapses again into a few drops of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be all very true, Master Fritz, if the steam were allowed to\r\nescape into the air; but it is only permitted to do that after it has\r\ndone duty on board ship. It appears that steam is very elastic, and\r\nmay be compressed like India-rubber, but has a tendency to resist the\r\npressure and set itself free. Imagine, for example, a headstrong young\r\nman, for a long time kept in restraint by parental control, suddenly\r\nlet loose, and allowed scope to follow the bent of his own\r\ninclinations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Willis; for argument's sake, let us take your headstrong\r\nyoung man, or rather the steam, for granted, and let us admit that it\r\nis as elastic as ever you please--but what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must imagine a piston in a cylinder, forced upwards when\r\nthe steam is heated, and falling downwards when the steam is cooled.\r\nNext fancy this upward and downward motion regulated by a number of\r\nwheels and cranks that turn two wheels on each side of the ship,\r\nkeeping up a constant jangling and clanking, the wheels or paddles\r\nsplashing in the water, and then you may form a slight idea of the\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Jack, \"we invented a machine of that kind for our canoe,\r\nwith a turnspit. Do you recollect it, Fritz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I recollect it well enough; and I also recollect that the canoe\r\nwent much better without than with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You spoke just now,\" continued Willis, \"of rival nations, who pounce\r\nlike birds of prey upon every new invention; and so it is with the\r\nsteamship. An American, named Fulton, made a trial in the Hudson with\r\none in 1807--that is about five years ago--and I believe the Yankees,\r\nin consequence, are laying claim to the invention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you bring the thing to my recollection,\" said Fritz, \"the\r\nidea of applying steam in the arts is by no means new, although, I\r\nmust candidly admit, I never heard of it being used in propelling\r\nships before. The Spaniards assert that a captain of one of their\r\nvessels, named Don Blas de Garay, discovered, as early as the\r\nsixteenth century, the art of making steam a motive power.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe that,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because a real Spaniard has never less than thirty-six words in his\r\nname. If you had said that the steam engine was discovered by Don\r\nPedrillo y Alvares y Toledo y Concha y Alonzo y Martinez y Xacarillo,\r\nor something of that sort, then I could believe the man to have been a\r\ngenuine Spaniard, but not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spaniard or no Spaniard, the Spanish claim the discovery of steam\r\nthrough Don Blas; the Italians likewise claim the discovery for a\r\nmechanician, named Bianca; the Germans assign its discovery to\r\nSolomon de Causs; the French urge Denis Papin; and the English claim\r\nthe invention for Roger Bacon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten the Swiss,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"The Swiss,\" replied Fritz, with an air of dignity, \"put forward no\r\ncandidate: steam and vapor and smoke are not much in their line. They\r\ndiscovered something infinitely better--the world is indebted to them\r\nfor the invention of liberty. I mean rational, intelligent, and true\r\nliberty--not the savagery and mob tyranny of red republicanism. The\r\nthree discoverers of this noble invention were Melchthal, Furst, and\r\nWilliam Tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have no idea,\" continued Willis, \"of the stir that steam was\r\ncreating in Europe the last time I was there. Of course there were\r\nplenty of incredulous people who said that it was no good; that it\r\nwould never be of any use; and that if it were, it would not pay for\r\nthe fuel consumed. On the other hand, the enthusiasts held that,\r\neventually, it would be used for everything; that in the air we should\r\nhave steam balloons; on the sea, steam ships, steam guns, and perhaps\r\nsteam men to work them; that on land there would be steam coaches\r\ndriven by steam horses. Journeys, say they, will be performed in no\r\ntime, that is, as soon as you start for a place you arrive at it, just\r\nlike an arrow, that no sooner leaves the bow than you see it stuck in\r\nthe bull's eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" observed Jack, \"it will be necessary to do away with\r\nrespiration, as well as horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Londoner will be able to say to his wife, My dear, I am going to\r\nBirmingham to-day, but I will be back to dinner; and if a Parisian\r\nlights his cigar at Paris, it will burn till he arrives at Bordeaux.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa, Willis, you have fairly converted Fritz and me into marines\r\nat last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only speaking of what will be, not of what is--that makes all\r\nthe difference you know. It is expected that there will be steam\r\ncoaches on every turnpike-road; so that, instead of hiring a\r\npost-chaise, you will have to order a locomotive, and instead of\r\npostboys, you will to engage an engineer and stoker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, instead of saying, Put the horses to,\" remarked Jack, \"we\r\nshall have to say, Get the steam up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; and when you go on a pleasure excursion, you will be whisked\r\nfrom one point to another without having time to see whether you pass\r\nthrough a desert or a flower-garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is to become of adventures by the way, road-side inns,\r\nand banditti?\"\r\n\r\n\"All to be suppressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appears,\" said Jack; \"men are to be carried about from place to\r\nplace like flocks of sheep; perhaps they will invent steam dogs as\r\nwell to run after stragglers, and bring them into the fold by the calf\r\nof the leg. Your new mode of going a-pleasuring may be a very\r\nexcellent thing in its way, Willis; but it would not suit my taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not; nor mine either, for the matter of that, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" said Fritz, \"you would run no danger of being upset\r\non the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but, by way of compensation, you may be blown up.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I forgot that.\"\r\n\r\n\"This conversation has carried us along another knot,\" said Jack,\r\nopening the log, which he had been appointed to keep; \"and now, by\r\nyour leave, I will read over some of my entries to refresh your\r\nmemories as to our proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"March 9th.--Wind fair and fresh--steered to north-west--a flock of\r\nseals under our lee bow--feel rather squeamish.\r\n\r\n\"10th.--No wind--fall in with a largish island and four little ones,\r\ngive them the name of Willis's Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\"11th.--A dead calm--sea smooth as a mirror--all of us dull and\r\nsleepy.\r\n\r\n\"12th.--Heat 90 deg.--shot a boobie, roasted and ate him, rather\r\nfishy--passed the night amongst some reefs.\r\n\r\n\"13th.--Same as the 12th, but no boobie.\r\n\r\n\"14th.--Same as the 13th.\r\n\r\n\"Dreadfully tiresome, is it not,\" said Jack; \"no wonder they call this\r\nocean the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" sighed Willis, thinking of the _Nelson_, \"it does not always\r\njustify the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"15th.--Hailed a low island, surrounded with breakers, named it\r\nSophia's Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But all these islands have been named half a dozen times already,\"\r\nsaid Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind that, another name or two will not break their backs.\"\r\n\r\n\"16th.--Current bearing us rapidly to westward--caught a sea cow, and\r\nhad it converted into pemican.\r\n\r\n\"17th.--Shot another boobie, which we put in the pot to remind us that\r\nwe were no worse off than the subjects of Henry IV. No wind--sea\r\nblazing like a furnace.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to turn over a new leaf in your log by-and-by,\" said\r\nWillis, \"or I am very much mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you are not mistaken, Willis, for I am tired of this\r\nsort of thing.\"\r\n\r\nA red haze now began to shroud the sun, the heat of the air became\r\nalmost stifling, but the muffled roar of distant thunder and bright\r\nflashes of light warned the voyagers to prepare for a change. Willis\r\nreefed the canvas close to the mast, and suggested that everything\r\nlikely to spoil should be put under hatches. This was scarcely done\r\nbefore the storm had reached them, and they were soon in the midst of\r\na tropical deluge. At first, a light breeze sprung up, blowing towards\r\nthe south-east, which continued till midnight, when it chopped round.\r\nTowards morning, it blew a heavy gale from east to east-south-east,\r\nwith a heavy sea running. In the meantime, the pinnace labored\r\nheavily, and several seas broke over her. Willis now saw that their\r\nonly chance of safety lay in altering their course. All the canvas was\r\nalready braced up except the jib, which was necessary to give the\r\ncraft headway, and with this sail alone they were soon after speeding\r\nat a rapid rate in the direction of the Polynesian Islands. The gale\r\ncontinued almost without intermission for three weeks, during which\r\nperiod Willis considered they must have been driven some hundreds, of\r\nmiles to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThe gale at length ceased, the sea resumed its tranquility, and the\r\nwind became favorable. The pinnace had, however, been a good deal\r\nbattered by the storm, and their fresh water was getting low, and it\r\nwas decided they should still keep a westerly course till they reached\r\nan island where they could refit before resuming their voyage.\r\n\r\n\"The gale has not done us much good,\" said Jack, sadly; \"if it had\r\nblown the other way, we might have been in the Indian Ocean by this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up,\" said Willis, taking the glass from his eye, \"I see land\r\nabout three miles to leeward, and the landing appears easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the savages?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"The islands of this latitude are not all inhabited,\" replied Fritz;\r\n\"besides, under our present circumstances, we have no alternative but\r\nto take our chance with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do not know that,\" objected Jack; \"it would be better for us\r\nto do without fresh water than to run the risk of being eaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful coast!\" cried Willis, who still kept the telescope\r\nat his eye. \"Near the shore the land is flat, and appears cultivated;\r\nbut behind, it rises gradually, and is closed in with a range of\r\nhills, covered with trees. There is a beautiful bay in front of us,\r\nwhich appears to invite us ashore. But the place is inhabited; the\r\nshore is strewn with huts, and I can see clumps of the bread-fruit\r\ntree growing near them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of vegetable is the bread-fruit?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very excellent thing, and supplies the natives with bread\r\nwithout the intervention of grain, flour-mills, or bakers. It can be\r\neaten either raw, or baked, or boiled; either way, it is palatable.\r\nThe tree itself is like our apple trees; but the fruit is as large as\r\na pine-apple--when it is ripe, it is yellow and soft. The natives,\r\nhowever, generally gather it before it is ripe; it is then cooked in\r\nan oven; the skin is burnt or peeled off--the inside is tender and\r\nwhite, like the crumb of bread or the flour of the potato.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me have the telescope an instant,\" said Fritz; \"I should like to\r\nsee what the natives are like. Ah, I see a troop of them collecting on\r\nshore; some of them seem to be covered with a kind of wrought-steel\r\narmor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the descendants of the Crusaders,\" remarked Jack, \"returning\r\nfrom the Holy Land by way of the Pacific Ocean!\"\r\n\r\n\"Others wear striped pantaloons,\" continued Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"That is to say,\" observed Willis, \"the whole lot of them are as naked\r\nas posts. What you suppose to be cuirasses and pantaloons, are their\r\ntabooed breasts and legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of that, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such garments are both durable and economical,\" remarked Jack; \"but I\r\nscarcely think they are suitable for stormy weather. But do you think\r\nit is safe to land amongst such a set of barebacked rascals, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not like to take the responsibility of guaranteeing our\r\nsafety; but I do not see what other course we can adopt.\"\r\n\r\nThey had now approached within musket-shot of the shore. They could\r\nsee that a venerable-looking old man stood a few paces in front of the\r\ngroup of natives. He held a green branch in one hand, and pressed with\r\nthe other a long flowing white beard to his breast.\r\n\r\n\"According to universal grammar,\" said Jack, \"these signs should mean\r\npeace and amity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Pilot; \"the more so that the rear-guard are pouring\r\nwater on their heads, which is the greatest mark of courtesy the\r\nnatives of Polynesia can show to strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Jack, taking off his cap and making a low bow, \"we\r\nare your most obedient servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be on our guard,\" said Willis; \"these savages are very\r\ndeceitful, and sometimes let fly their arrows under a show of\r\nfriendship. I will go on shore alone, whilst you keep at a little\r\ndistance off, ready to fire to cover my retreat, if need be.\"\r\n\r\nThe young men objected to Willis incurring danger that they did not\r\nshare; but on this point Willis was inexorable, so they were obliged\r\nto suffer him to depart alone. By good chance, they had shipped a\r\nsmall cask of glass beads on board the pinnace. The Pilot took a few\r\nof these with him, and, placing a cask and a couple of calabashes in\r\nthe canoe, he rowed ashore.\r\n\r\nThe natives were evidently in great commotion; there was an immense\r\namount of running backwards and forwards. Something important was,\r\nobviously enough, going forward; but, whether the excitement was\r\ncaused by curiosity or admiration, it was hard to say. They might be\r\npreparing a friendly reception for the stranger, or they might be\r\npreparing to eat him--which of the two was an interesting question\r\nthat Willis did not care about probing too deeply at that particular\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack anxiously watched the operations of the natives from\r\nthe bay. They could not with safety abandon the pinnace; but to leave\r\nWillis to the mercy of the sinister-looking people on shore was not to\r\nbe thought of either. The _Mary_ was, therefore, run in as close as\r\npossible, and Jack leaped on the sands a few minutes after the Pilot.\r\n\r\nWillis marched boldly on towards the natives, and when he arrived\r\nbeside the old man, the crowd opened up and formed an avenue through\r\nwhich a chief advanced, followed by a number of men, seemingly\r\npriests, who carried a grotesque-looking figure that Jack presumed to\r\nbe an idol. The figure was made up of wicker-work--was of colossal\r\nheight--the features, which represented nothing on earth beneath nor\r\nheaven above, were inconceivably hideous--the eyes were discs of\r\nmother-of-pearl, with a nut in the centre--the teeth were apparently\r\nthose of a shark, and the body was covered with a mantle of red\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nAt the command of the chief, some of the natives advanced and placed a\r\nquantity of bananas, bread-fruits, and other vegetables at the Pilot's\r\nfeet; the priests then came forward and knelt down before him, and\r\nseemed to worship after the fashion of the ancients when they paid\r\ntheir devotions to the Eleusinian goddess, or the statue of Apollo.\r\nMeanwhile, Jack, on his side, was likewise surrounded by the natives,\r\nwho was treated with much less ceremony than Willis. Instead of\r\nfalling down on their knees, each of them, one after the other, rubbed\r\ntheir noses against his, and then danced round him with every\r\ndemonstration of savage joy.\r\n\r\nJack had now an opportunity of observing the personages about him more\r\nin detail. They were mostly tall and well-formed; their features bore\r\nsome resemblance to those of a negro, their nose being flat and their\r\nlips thick; on the other hand, they had the high cheek-bones of the\r\nNorth American Indian and the forehead of the Malay. Nearly all of\r\nthem were entirely naked, but wore a necklace and bracelets of shells.\r\nThey were armed with a sort of spear and an axe of hard wood edged\r\nwith stone. Their skins were tattooed all over with lines and circles,\r\nand painted; these decorations, in some instances, exhibiting careful\r\nexecution and no inconsiderable degree of artistic skill. These\r\nobservations made, Jack pushed his way to the spot where Willis was\r\nreceiving the homage of the priests.\r\n\r\n\"What! you here?\" said the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Willis, I have come to see what detained you. By the way, is\r\nthere anything the matter with my nose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that I can see; but the natives of New Zealand rub their\r\nnoses against each other, and probably the same usage is fashion\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do they make you an exception?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not the remotest idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe priests at length rose, and the chief advanced. This dignitary\r\naddressed a long discourse to Willis in a sing-song tone, which lasted\r\nnearly half an hour. After this, he stood aside, and looked at Willis,\r\nas if he expected a reply.\r\n\r\n\"Illustrious chief, king, prince, or nabob,\" said Willis, \"I am highly\r\nflattered by all the fine things you have just said to me. It is true,\r\nI have not understood a single word, but the fruits you have placed\r\nbefore me speak a language that I can understand. Howsomever, most\r\nmighty potentate, we are not in want of provisions; but if you can\r\nshow us a spring of good water, you will confer upon us an everlasting\r\nfavor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might just as well ask him to show you what o'clock it is by the\r\ndial of his cathedral,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"They would only point to the sun if I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the sun invisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they would be in the same position as we are when we forget to\r\nwind up our watches. Gentlemen savages,\" he said, turning to the\r\nnatives and handing them the glass beads, \"accept these trifles as a\r\ntoken of our esteem.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives required no pressing, but accepted the proffered gifts\r\nwith great good-will. The dancing and singing then recommenced with\r\nredoubled fury, and poor Jack's nose was almost obliterated by the\r\nconstant rubbing it underwent.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hubbub ceased, and a profound silence reigned throughout\r\nthe assembly. The oldest of the priests brought a mantle of red\r\nfeathers, similar to the one that covered the idol. This was thrown\r\nover the Pilot's shoulders; a tuft of feathers, something resembling a\r\nfuneral plume, was placed upon his head, and a large semi-circular fan\r\nwas thrust into his hand. Thus equipped, a procession was formed, one\r\nhalf before and the other half behind him. The _cortége_ began to move\r\nslowly in the direction of the interior, but the operation was\r\ndisconcerted by Willis, who remained stock-still.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I would rather not go far away from the shore.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the natives saw clearly that Willis was not disposed to\r\nmove, the chief issued a mandate, and four stout fellows immediately\r\nremoved the idol from its position, and Willis was placed upon the\r\nvacant pedestal.\r\n\r\nThe kind of adoration with which all these proceedings were\r\naccompanied greatly perplexed the voyagers. What could it all mean?\r\nWas this a common mode of welcoming strangers? It occurred to Jack\r\nthat the Romans were accustomed to decorate with flowers the victims\r\nthey designed as sacrifices to the altars of their gods before\r\nimmolating them. This reminiscence made his flesh creep with horror,\r\nand filled him with the utmost dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Willis!\" he cried to the Pilot, whom they were now leading off in\r\ntriumph, \"let us try the effects of our rifles on this rabble; you\r\njump over the heads of your worshippers, and we will charge through\r\nthem to shore. I will shoot the first man that pursues us, and signal\r\nFritz to discharge the four-pounder amongst them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" replied Willis; \"we should both be stuck all over with\r\narrows and lances before we could reach the pinnace. Did I not tell\r\nyou not to come ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Willis, but did you suppose I had no heart? How could I look on\r\nquietly whilst you were surrounded by a mob of ferocious-looking men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, Master Jack, say no more about it; I do not suppose they\r\nmean to do me any harm; but there would be danger in rousing the\r\npassions of such a multitude of people. They seem, luckily, to direct\r\ntheir attentions exclusively to me, so you had better go back and look\r\nafter the canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I shall follow you wherever you go, Willis, even into the\r\nsoup-kettles of the wretches.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Willis, \"the wine is poured out, and, such as it\r\nis, we must drink it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nJUPITER TONANS--THE THUNDERS OF THE PILOT--WORSHIPPERS OF THE\r\nFAR WEST--A LATE BREAKFAST--RONO THE GREAT--A POLYNESIAN\r\nLEGEND--MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF OCEANIA--MR.

The solution of\r\nthis question became, for the moment, of greater importance to Willis\r\nthan the \"to be or not to be\" of Hamlet to the State of Denmark. This\r\nincertitude was all the more painful, that it was accompanied by\r\nmyriads of insects, created by the recent rains; these swarmed in the\r\nair to such an extent, that it was utterly impossible to inhale the\r\none without swallowing the other. The sailor, notwithstanding his\r\nelevated and somewhat perilous position, true to his instincts and\r\ntormented by the flies, took out his pipe, filled it, and struck a\r\nlight. As soon as the first column of smoke issued from his mouth, the\r\ncavalcade halted spontaneously, the natives fell on their faces, their\r\nnoses touching the ground, and in an attitude of the profoundest fear\r\nand apprehension. Jupiter thundering never created such a sensation as\r\nWillis smoking. The savages seemed glued to the earth with terror. If\r\nthe Pilot had thought it advisable to escape, he might have walked\r\nover the prostrate bodies of his captors, not one of whom would have\r\nbeen bold enough to follow what appeared to be a human volcano,\r\nvomiting fire and smoke,--the fire of course being understood.\r\n\r\nWillis, however, now saw that he possessed in his pipe a ready means\r\nof awing them. Besides, it was clear that, through some fortunate\r\ncoincidence, the natives had mistaken him for a divinity. There was,\r\nconsequently, no immediate danger to be apprehended; he therefore\r\nbecame himself again, and began to enjoy the novelty of his new\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a curious contrast. Willis, seated on a sort of\r\nthrone, crowned with a waving plume of feathers, shrouded in a fiery\r\nmantle, and surrounded by a crowd of prostrate figures, was quietly\r\npuffing ribbons of smoke from the tips of his lips. There he sat, for\r\nall the world like a crane in a duck-pond. From time to time the more\r\ndaring of the worshippers slightly raised their heads to see whether\r\nJupiter was still thundering; but when their eye caught a whiff of\r\nsmoke, they speedily resumed their former posture. Some of them even\r\nthrust their heads into holes, or behind stones, as if more\r\neffectually to shelter themselves from the fury of the fiery furnace.\r\nAt last the eruption ceased, Willis knocked the ashes out of his pipe,\r\nreplaced it in his pocket, and the convoy resumed its route. After\r\nhalf an hour's march, the procession halted near a clump of plantains,\r\nin front of a structure more ambitious than any of those in the\r\nneighborhood. A female, laden with rude ornaments, was standing at the\r\ndoor. This lady, who rivalled the celebrated Daniel Lambert in\r\ndimensions, would have created quite a _furore_ at Bartholomew Fair;\r\naccording to Jack, she was so amazingly fat, that it would have taken\r\nfull five minutes to walk round her. She took the Pilot respectfully\r\nby the hand, and led him into the interior of the building, which was\r\ncrowded with images of various forms, and was evidently a temple.\r\nWillis, at a sign from his conductress, seated himself in a chair,\r\nraised on a dais, and surmounted by a terrific figure similar to the\r\none already described, but draped in white feathers instead of red.\r\n\r\nThe fat lady, or rather the high priestess--for she was the reigning\r\npotentate in this magazine of idols--took a sucking pig that was held\r\nby one of the priests. After muttering a prayer or homily of some\r\nsort, she strangled the poor animal, and returned it to the priest. By\r\nand by, the pig was brought in again cooked, and presented with great\r\nceremony to Willis. There were likewise sundry dishes of fruit, nuts,\r\nand several small cups containing some kind of liquid. One of the\r\npriests cut up the pig, and lifted pieces of it to Willis's mouth;\r\nthese, however, he refused to eat. The fat priestess, observing this,\r\nchewed one or two mouthfuls, which she afterwards handed to the Pilot.\r\nThis was putting the sailor's gallantry to rather a rude test. He was\r\nequal to the emergency, and did not refuse the offering. But he must\r\nhave felt at the time, that being a divinity was not entirely without\r\nits attendant inconveniences.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only infliction of the kind he was doomed to\r\nwithstand. One of the priests took up a piece of kava-root, put it\r\ninto his mouth, chewed it, and then dropped a bit into each of the\r\ncups already noticed. One of these, containing this nectar, was\r\npresented to Willis by the fat Hebe who presided at the feast, and he\r\nhad the fortitude to taste it. Another of the cups was handed to Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you,\" said he, shaking his head; \"I breakfasted rather\r\nlate this morning.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, another personage had entered upon the scene. After having\r\nperformed an obeisance to Willis like the rest, this individual backed\r\nhimself to where Jack was standing, by this means adroitly avoiding\r\nboth the kava and the nose-rubbings. He was distinguished from the\r\nother natives by an ornament round his waist, which fell to his knees.\r\nHis skin seemed a trifle less dark, his features less marked; but his\r\nbody was tattooed and stained after the common fashion.\r\n\r\nThe new comer turned out to be a Portuguese deserter, who had\r\nabandoned his ship twenty years before, and had married the daughter\r\nof a chief of the island on which he now was. At the present moment,\r\nhe filled the part of prime minister to the king, an office be could\r\nnot have held in his own ungrateful country, since he could neither\r\nread nor write. These accomplishments, it appeared, were not,\r\nhowever, absolutely indispensable in Polynesia. It has been found that\r\nwhen a savage is transferred to Europe, he readily acquires the habits\r\nof civilized life. By a similar adaptation of things to circumstances,\r\nthis European had identified himself with the savages. He had adopted\r\ntheir manners, their customs, and their costume. When he thought of\r\nhis own country, it was only to wonder why he ever submitted to the\r\nconstraint of a coat, or put himself to the trouble of handling a fork\r\nand spoon. He had not, however, entirely forgotten his mother tongue,\r\nand, moreover, still retained in his memory a few English words. He\r\nwas likewise very communicative, and told Jack that they were in the\r\nIsland of Hawai; that the name of the king was Toubowrai Tamaidi, who,\r\nhe added, intended visiting the pinnace with the queen next day, to\r\npay his respects in person to the great Rono. \"His Majesty,\" said the\r\nPortuguese, \"would have been amongst the first to throw himself at his\r\nfeet, but unfortunately the royal residence is a good way off; and\r\nthough both the king and the queen are on the way, running as fast as\r\nthey can, it may take them some time yet to reach the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is the great Rono?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the prime minister, \"you ought to know best, since you\r\narrived with him.\"\r\n\r\nJack felt that he was touching on delicate ground, and saw that it was\r\nnecessary to diplomatise a little.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said he; \"but I am not acquainted with the position that\r\nillustrious person holds in relation to Hawai.\" The Portuguese then\r\nmade a very long, rambling, and not very lucid statement, from which\r\nJack gleaned the following details. About a hundred years before,\r\nduring the reign of one of the first kings, there lived a great\r\nwarrior, whose name was Rono. This chief was very popular, but he was\r\nvery jealous. In a moment of anger he killed his wife, of whom he was\r\npassionately fond. The regret and grief that resulted from this act\r\ndrove him out of his senses; he wandered disconsolately about the\r\nisland, fought and quarrelled with every one that came near him. At\r\nlast, in a fit of despair, he embarked in a large canoe, and, after\r\npromising to return at the expiration of twelve hundred moons, with a\r\nwhite face and on a floating island, he put out to sea, and was never\r\nheard of more.\r\n\r\nThis tradition, it appears, had been piously handed down from family\r\nto family. The natives of Hawai--who are not more extravagant in the\r\nmatter of idols than some nations who boast a larger amount of\r\ncivilization, but who do not destroy them so often--enrolled Rono\r\namongst the list of their divinities. An image of him was set up,\r\nsacrifices were instituted in his honor. Every year the day of his\r\ndeparture was kept sacred, and devoted to religious ceremonies. The\r\ntwelfth hundred moon had just set, when a large boat appeared in the\r\nbay, and a man came ashore. The high priest of the temple, Raou, and\r\nhis daughter, On La, priestess of Rono, solemnly declared that the man\r\nin question was Rono himself, who had returned at the precise time\r\nnamed, and in the manner he promised.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, clear from this statement that Willis was to be\r\nhenceforward Rono the Great.\r\n\r\nJack was rather pleased than otherwise to learn that he was the\r\ncompanion of a real live divinity. It assured him, in the first place,\r\nthat the danger of his being converted into a stew or a fricassee was\r\nnot imminent. He did not forget, however, that the consequences might\r\nbe perilous if, by any chance, the illusion ceased; for he knew that\r\nthe greater the height from which a man falls, the less the mercy\r\nshown to him when he is down. As soon, therefore, as the ceremonies\r\nhad a little relaxed, and Willis was left some freedom of action, Jack\r\nwent forward, and knelt before him in his turn.\r\n\r\n\"O sublime Rono,\" said he, \"I know now why your nose has escaped all\r\nthe rubbings that mine has had to undergo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" said Willis; \"glad to hear it, for I am as much in the dark\r\nas ever.\"\r\n\r\nJack then related to him the fabulous legend he had just heard.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Willis shook off his _entourage_ as gently as possible,\r\nand succeeded in getting out of the temple. Accompanied by Jack, he\r\nproceeded towards the shore, receiving, as he went, the adoration of\r\nthe people. The route was strewn with fruit, cocoa-nuts, and pigs, and\r\nthe natives were highly delighted when any of their offerings were\r\naccepted by the deified Rono.\r\n\r\nThe islanders appeared mild, docile, and intelligent, notwithstanding\r\nthe singular delusion that possessed them. Living from day to day,\r\nthey were, doubtless, ignorant of those continual cares and\r\ncalculations for the future that in the old world pursue us even into\r\nthe hours of sleep. Were they happier in consequence? Yes, if the\r\nchild is happier than the man, and if we admit that we often loose in\r\ntranquillity and happiness what we gain in knowledge and perfection:\r\nyes, if happiness is not exclusively attached to certain peoples and\r\ncertain climates; yes, if it is true that, with contentment, happiness\r\nis everywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the Hawaians are singular structures, and scarcely can\r\nbe called dwellings. They consist of three rows of posts, two on each\r\nside and one in the middle, the whole covered with a slanting roof,\r\nbut without any kind of wall whatever.\r\n\r\nThey do not bury their dead, but swing them up in a sort of hammock,\r\nabundantly supplied with provisions. It is supposed that this is done\r\nwith a view to enable the souls of the departed to take their flight\r\nmore readily to heaven. The practice, consequently, seems to indicate\r\nthat the natives possess a confused idea of a future state. When a\r\nchild dies, flowers are placed in the hammock along with the\r\nprovisions--a touch of the nature common to us all. They express deep\r\ngrief by inflicting wounds upon their faces with a shark's tooth; and,\r\nwhen they feel themselves in danger of dying, they cut off a joint of\r\nthe little finger to appease the anger of the Divinity. There was\r\nscarcely one of the adult islanders who was not mutilated in this way.\r\n\r\nThough the worshippers of the great Rono appeared gentle and peaceable\r\nenough, there were to be seen here and there a human jaw-bone,\r\nseemingly fresh, with the teeth entire, suspended over the entrances\r\nto the huts. These ghastly objects sent a shudder quivering through\r\nJack's frame, and made Willis aware that it would not be advisable\r\nrashly to throw off his sacred character.\r\n\r\nAs it was now late, and as they knew that Fritz would be uneasy about\r\nthem, they put off laying in their stock of water till next day. Jack\r\ntold the prime minister that the great Rono would be prepared to\r\nreceive their majesties whenever they chose to visit him. This done,\r\nWillis and his companion seated themselves in the canoe, and rowed out\r\nto the pinnace.\r\n\r\n\"God be thanked, you have returned in safety!\" cried Fritz; \"I never\r\nwas so uneasy in the whole course of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, brother, we have not been without our anxieties as well, and\r\nhad we not happened to have had a divinity amongst us, we might not\r\nhave come off scathless.\"\r\n\r\nJack then related their adventures, which gradually brought a smile to\r\nthe pale lips of Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"But the water?\" inquired Fritz, after he had heard the story.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, water; they offered us something to drink on shore that will\r\nprevent us being thirsty for a month to come, but we shall see to that\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nTowards dark, some fireworks were discharged on board the pinnace, by\r\nway of demonstrating that Willis's pipe was not the only fiery terror\r\nthe great Rono had at his command.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning a flotilla of canoes were observed rounding one of\r\nthe points that formed the bay. The one in advance was larger than the\r\nothers, and was evidently the trunk of a large tree hollowed out.\r\nJack's new friend, the Portuguese, hailed the pinnace, and announced\r\nthe King and Queen of Hawai, who thereupon scrambled into the pinnace.\r\nHis majesty King Toubowrai had probably felt it incumbent upon himself\r\nto do honor to the illustrious Rono, for he wore an old uniform coat,\r\nvery likely the produce of a wreck, through the sleeves of which the\r\nangular knobs of his copper-colored elbows projected. He did not seem\r\nvery much at his ease in this garment, which contrasted oddly with the\r\ntight-fitting tattooed skin that served him for pantaloons.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Queen Tonico, princess-like was half stifled in a thick\r\nblanket or mat of cocoa-nut fibre. Her ears were heavily laden with\r\nteeth and ornaments of various kinds, made out of bone, mother of\r\npearl, and tortoise-shell. Her nails were two or three inches long;\r\nand, to judge by the number of finger-joints that were wanting, she\r\nwas either troubled with delicate nerves, or was slightly\r\nhypochondriac.\r\n\r\nThe royal pair were accompanied by a band of music: fortunately, this\r\nremained in the regal barge. It consisted of a flute with four holes,\r\na nondescript instrument, seemingly made of stones; a drum made out of\r\nthe hollow trunk of a tree, covered at each end with skin, of what\r\nkind it is needless to inquire. The sounds emitted by this orchestra\r\nwere of an ear-rending nature, and of a kind graphically termed by the\r\nGermans Katzenmusik.\r\n\r\n\"Illustrious Rono,\" cried Jack, \"for goodness sake, tell these\r\ngentlemen you are not a lover of sweet sounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Belay there!\" roared Willis.\r\n\r\nThis command, however, had no effect; the artists continued thumping\r\nand blowing away as before. Willis, thinking to make himself better\r\nheard, placed his hands on his mouth, and roared the same order\r\nthrough them. This action seemed to be received as a mark of\r\napprobation, for the noise became absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" said Willis: \"I can make nothing of them. You try what you\r\ncan do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Jack, lighting what is technically termed an\r\n_artichoke_, but better known as a zig-zag cracker; \"if they do not\r\nunderstand English, perhaps they may comprehend pyrotechnics.\"\r\n\r\nThe artichoke was thrown into the royal barge. At first there was only\r\na slight whiz, finally it gave an angry bound and leaped into the\r\nmidst of the musicians. Startled, they tried to get out of its way;\r\nbut they were no sooner at what they thought to be a safe distance,\r\nthan the thing was amongst them again. Their majesties, who were just\r\nthen engaged in kissing the Rono's feet, started up in alarm; but when\r\nthey saw the danger did not menace themselves, they burst into a\r\nhearty laugh at the antics of their suite.\r\n\r\nThis episode over, and the orchestra silenced, the Sovereign of Hawai\r\nproceeded to inspect the pinnace. He expressed his delight every now\r\nand then by uttering the syllables \"_ta-ta_.\" Fritz handed one of\r\nthose shaving glasses to the Queen that lengthen the objects they\r\nreflect. This astonished her Majesty vastly, and caused her to _ta-ta_\r\nat a great rate. She looked behind the mirror, turned it upside down,\r\nand at last, when she felt assured that it was the royal person it\r\ncaricatured, she commenced measuring her cheeks to account for the\r\nextraordinary disproportion.\r\n\r\nThey next all sat down to a repast that was spread on deck. Their\r\nMajesties observing Rono use a fork, did so likewise; but though they\r\nstuck a piece of meat on the end of it, and held it in one hand, they\r\ncontinued carrying the viands to their mouths with the other. At the\r\nconclusion of the feast, Willis took a pinch of snuff out of a\r\ncanister. Their Majesties insisted upon doing so likewise. Willis\r\nhanded them the canister, and they filled their noses with the\r\ntreacherous powder. Then followed a duet of sneezing, accompanied with\r\nfacial contortions. The royal personages thinking, probably, that they\r\nwere poisoned, leaped into the sea like a couple of frogs, and swam to\r\nthe royal barge.\r\n\r\n\"Holloa, sire,\" cried Jack, \"where are you off to?\"\r\n\r\nThis was answered by the barge paddling away rapidly towards land.\r\nHitherto, the whole affair had been a farce; but now the natives, who\r\nhad collected in great numbers along the shore, seeing their king and\r\nqueen leap into the water with a terrified air, supposed that an\r\nattempt had been made to cut short their royal lives, and, under this\r\nimpression, discharged a cloud of arrows at the pinnace, and matters\r\nbegan to assume a serious aspect.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Jack, \"shooting at the great Rono!\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Fritz, \"only proves they are men like ourselves. He who\r\nis covered with incense one day, is very often immolated the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that simply because Rono treated Mr. and Mrs. What's-their-names\r\nto a pinch of snuff. Serve them right to discharge the contents of the\r\nfour-pounder amongst them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried Willis; \"the worthy people are, perhaps, fond of their\r\nking and queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worthy people or not,\" said Fritz, drawing out an arrow that had sunk\r\ninto the capstan, \"it is very likely that if this dart had hit one of\r\nus, there would only have been two instead of three in the crew of the\r\npinnace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Willis, \"Master Jack thought the voyage rather dull; now\r\nsomething has turned up to relieve the monotony of his log.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are still without fresh water though, Willis; I wish you could say\r\nthat had turned up as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be prudent to go in search of that somewhere else now,\" said\r\nWillis, unfurling the sails. \"Fortunately the wind is fresh, and we\r\ncan make considerable headway before night.\"\r\n\r\nAs they steered gently out of the bay a second cloud of arrows was\r\nsent after them, but this time they fell short.\r\n\r\n\"The belief in Rono is about to be seriously compromised,\" remarked\r\nFritz; \"I should advise the priestess to retire into private life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because she is too fat to live in an ordinary house, she could only\r\nbreathe in a temple. But, O human vicissitudes!\" added Jack, rolling\r\nhimself up in a sail after the manner of the Roman senators; \"behold\r\nRono the Great banished from his country, and compelled to go and\r\npillow his head on a foreign sail, like Marius at Minturnus--like\r\nCoriolanus amongst the Volcians--like Hannibal at the house of\r\nAntiochus--like Alcibiades at the castle of Grunium in Phrygia, given\r\nto him out of charity by the benevolent Pharnabazus, and in which he\r\nwas burnt alive by his countrymen--like Cimon, voted into exile by\r\nballot and universal suffrage--like Aristides, whom the people got\r\ntired of hearing called the Just, and many others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are all these personages?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"They were worthies of another age,\" replied Fritz; \"very excellent\r\nmen in their way, and you are in no way dishonored by being numbered\r\namongst them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday,\" continued Jack, \"an entire people were upon their knees\r\nbefore you; they offered up sacrifices, and poured out incense on\r\ntheir altars for you; fruit and pigs were scattered in heaps, like\r\nflowers, upon your path; the crowd were prostrated by the fumes of\r\nyour pipe. To-day--alas, the change!--a cloud of arrows, and not a\r\nsingle glass of cold water!\"\r\n\r\n\"That gives you an opportunity of quenching your thirst with the\r\nnectar offered to you yesterday,\" said Fritz; \"as for myself, I have\r\nno such resource.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was a posset to quench one's thirst withal; I only wish I\r\nhad a cupful to give you. I do not regret having had an opportunity of\r\nbecoming acquainted with the people though. They have enabled me to\r\nrectify some erroneous notions I formerly entertained. If, for\r\nexample, I were to ask you what air consists of? you would, no doubt,\r\nreply that is a compound body made of oxygen and hydrogen or azote, in\r\nthe proportion of twenty-one of the one to seventy-nine of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, most undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, such is not the case; there are other elements in the air\r\nbesides these.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean that the air accidentally, or even permanently, holds in\r\nsolution a certain quantity of water, or a portion of carbonic acid\r\ngas, and possibly some particles of dust arising from terrestrial\r\nbodies, then I grant your premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; what I mean is, that the air of Hawai is composed of three\r\ndistinct elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but if so, the air in question is not known to chemists.\"\r\n\r\n\"These three elements are oxygen, hydrogen, and insects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, insects! I might have fancied you were driving at some hypothesis\r\nof that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to communicate this discovery to the first learned society\r\nwe fall in with.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Pacific Ocean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: there or elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always understood,\" observed Willis, \"that air was a sort of cloud,\r\none and indivisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cloud if you like, Willis; but do you know the weight of it you\r\ncarry on your shoulders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it cannot be very great, otherwise I should feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to a ton or so, old fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish me to believe that, you will have to explain how, where,\r\nwhen, why, and wherefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Willis; you have bathed sometimes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what water weighs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I know that it is heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a square yard of air weighs two pounds and a half, but a square\r\nyard of water weighs two thousand pounds. Now, can you calculate the\r\nweight of the water that is on your back and pressing on your sides\r\nwhen you swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not sufficiently up in arithmetic to do that, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor am I either, Willis; but let me ask you how it is that the waves\r\ndo not carry you along with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because one wave neutralises the effect of another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; but how is it that these ponderous waves, coming down upon\r\nyou, do not crush you to atoms by their mere weight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose that liquids do not operate in the same way as\r\nsolids: perhaps there is something in our bodies that counterbalances\r\nthe effect of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely; and if such be the case as regards water, may it not be\r\nso also as regards air?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not feel air; whereas, if I go into water, I not only feel\r\nit, but taste it sometimes, and I cannot force my way through it\r\nwithout considerable exertion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because you are organized to live in air and not in water.\r\nYou ask the smallest sprat or sticklebake if it does not, in the same\r\nway feel the air obstruct its progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would the stickleback answer me, Master Fritz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, if it is polite and well bred?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Willis,\" inquired Jack, \"do you ever recollect having\r\nlived without breathing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then; had you felt the weight of the air at any given\r\nmoment, it must have produced an impression you never felt before, but\r\nyou have not, because circumstances have never varied. A sensation\r\nsupposes a contrast, whilst, ever since you existed, you have always\r\nbeen subject to atmospheric pressure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now I begin to get at the gist of your argument. You mean, for\r\nexample, that I would never have appreciated the delicate flavor of\r\nMaryland or Havanna, had I not been accustomed to smoke the\r\ncabbage-leaf manufactured in Whitechapel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so; and take for another example the farm of Antisana,\r\nwhich is situated about midway up the Cordilleras, mountains of South\r\nAmerica. When travellers, arriving there from the summits which are\r\ncovered with perpetual snow, meet others arriving from the plain where\r\nthe heat is intense, those that descend are invariably bathed in\r\nperspiration, whilst those that have come up are shivering with cold\r\nand covered with furs. The reason of this is, that we cannot feel warm\r\ntill we have been cold, and _vice versâ_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our bodies,\" resumed Fritz, \"however much the thermometer descends,\r\nnever mark less than thirty-five degrees above zero. In winter the\r\nskin shrinks, and becomes a bad conductor of heat from without; but,\r\nat the same time, does not allow so much gas and vapor to escape from\r\nwithin. In summer, on the contrary, the skin dilates and allows\r\nperspiration to form, a process that consumes a considerable amount of\r\nlatent heat. Starting from this principle, it has been calculated that\r\na man, breathing twenty times in a minute, generates as much heat in\r\ntwenty-four hours as would boil a bucket of water taken at zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"If means could be found,\" remarked Jack, \"to furnish him with a\r\nboiler, by fixing a piston here and a pipe there man might be\r\nconverted into one of the machines we were talking about the other\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I disposed to philosophize,\" added Fritz, \"I might prove to you\r\nthat for a long time men have been little else than mere machines.\"\r\n\r\nBefore night they had run about thirty miles further to the\r\nnorth-east, without seeing any thing beyond a formidable bluff,\r\nguarded by a fringe of breakers, that would soon have swallowed up the\r\n_Mary_ had she ventured to reach the land. It was necessary however to\r\nobtain fresh water at any price before they resumed their voyage.\r\n\r\nIt was to be feared that all the islanders of the Pacific were not in\r\nexpectation of a great Rono, consequently Willis suggested that it\r\nwould be as well to search for an uninhabited spot. The only question\r\nwas, how long they might have to search before they succeeded; for\r\nthey knew that there were plenty of small islands in these latitudes\r\nunencumbered by savages, and furnished with pools and springs of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNight at length closed in upon them, and with it came a dense mist,\r\nthat enveloped the _Mary_ as if in a triple veil of muslin.\r\n\r\n\"Willis,\" inquired Jack, \"what difference is there between a mist and\r\na cloud?\"\r\n\r\n\"None that I know of,\" replied the Pilot, \"except that a cloud which\r\nwe are in is mist, and mist that we are not in is a cloud. And now, my\r\nlads,\" he added, \"you may turn in, for I intend to take the first\r\nwatch.\"\r\n\r\nBefore turning in, however, all three joined in a short prayer. The\r\nyoung men had not yet forgotten the pious precepts of their father.\r\nPrayer is beautiful everywhere, but nowhere is it so beautiful as on\r\nthe open sea, with infinity above and an abyss beneath. Then, when all\r\nis silent save the roar of the waves and the howling of the winds, it\r\nis sublime to hear the humble voice of the sailor murmuring, \"Star of\r\nthe night, pray for us!\"\r\n\r\nThat night the star of the night did pray for the three voyagers, for\r\nthe rays of the moon burst through the darkness and the mist, and fell\r\nupon a long line of reefs under the lee of the pinnace. Had they held\r\non their course a few minutes longer, our story would have been ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nLYING TO--HEART AND INSTINCT--SPARROWS VIEWED AS\r\nCONSUMERS--MIGRATIONS--POSTING A LETTER IN THE\r\nPACIFIC--CANNIBALS--ADVENTURES OF A LOCKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glimpse of moonshine only lasted a second, but it was sufficient\r\nto light up the valley of the shadow of death. All around was again\r\nenveloped in obscurity. The moon, like a modest benefactor who hides\r\nhimself from those to whose wants he has ministered, concealed itself\r\nbehind its screen of blackness.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was thrown into stays, and they resolved to lie-to till\r\ndaybreak. There might be rocks to windward as well as to leeward; at\r\nall events, they felt that their safest course lay in maintaining, as\r\nfar as possible, their actual position; and, after having returned\r\nthanks for their almost miraculous escape, they made the usual\r\narrangements for passing the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning they found themselves in the midst of a labyrinth of\r\nrocks, from which, with the help of Providence, they succeeded in\r\nextricating themselves. The rocks, or rather reefs, amongst which they\r\nwere entangled, are very common in these seas. As they are scarcely\r\nvisible at high water, they are extremely dangerous, and often baffle\r\nthe skill of the most expert navigator.\r\n\r\nWhilst Willis steered the pinnace amongst the islands and rocks of the\r\nHawaian Archipelago, Fritz kept a look-out for savages, fresh water,\r\nand eligible landing-places. And Jack, after having posted up his log,\r\nset about inditing a letter for home.\r\n\r\n\"The voyage,\" said he, \"has lately been so prolific in adventure, that\r\nI scarcely know where to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Begin by saluting them all round,\" suggested Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"But, brother of mine, that is usually done at the end of the\r\nletter,\" objected Jack.\r\n\r\n\"What then? you can repeat the salutations at the end, and you might\r\nalso, for that matter, put them in the middle as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have written lots of letters on board ship for my comrades,\"\r\nremarked Willis, \"and I invariably commenced by saying--_I take a pen\r\nin my hand to let you know I am well, hoping you are the same_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could you take in your hand for such a purpose, O Rono?\"\r\ninquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, after this preamble, I added, '_but I am afraid_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you old salts were never afraid of anything, short of the\r\nFlying Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the letters I put that in were for young lubbers, who,\r\ninstead of sending home half their pay, were writing for extra\r\nsupplies, and were naturally in great fear that their requests would\r\nbe refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely think I shall adopt that style, Willis, even though it\r\nwere recognized by the navy regulations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the pigeon will find its way with the letter from here\r\nto New Switzerland?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt about that,\" replied Fritz, \"it naturally returns to\r\nits nest and its affections. If you had wings, would you not fly\r\nstraight off in the direction of the Bass Rock or Ailsa Craig, to hunt\r\nup your old arm-chair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of it; I feel my heart go pit-pat when I think of home,\r\nsweet home.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do the birds. When they soften the grain before they throw it into\r\nthe maw of their fledgelings--when they fly off and return laden with\r\nmidges to their nests--when they tear the down from their breasts to\r\nprotect their eggs and their young, do you think their hearts do not\r\nbeat as well as yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"But all that is said to be instinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heart or instinct, where is the difference? The Abbé Spallanzani saw\r\ntwo swallows that were carried to Milan return to Pavia in fifteen\r\nminutes, and the distance between the two cities is seven leagues.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I can easily believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you see a little, insignificant bird flying backwards and\r\nforwards, perching on one branch and hopping off to another,\r\nwhistling, carolling, perching here and there, you think that it has\r\nno cares, that it does not reflect, and that it does not love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have heard in my time a great many wonderful stories of\r\nrobin-redbreasts and jenny-wrens, but I always understood that they\r\nwere intended only to amuse little boys and girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"You consider, doubtless, that a field-sparrow is not a creature of\r\nmuch importance; but do you know that he consumes half a bushel of\r\ncorn annually?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is his only merit, the farmers, I dare say, would be glad to\r\nget rid of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is not his only merit. What do you think of his killing three\r\nthousand insects a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is more to the purpose. But, to return to the pigeon, supposing\r\nit is possible for it to find its way, how long do you suppose it will\r\ntake to get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is estimated that birds of passage fly over two hundred miles a\r\nday, if they keep on the wing for six hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred miles in six hours is fast sailing, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swallows have been seen in Senegal on the 9th of October, that is,\r\neight or nine days after they leave Europe; and that journey they\r\nrepeat every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must surely make some preparations for such a lengthy\r\nexcursion.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the period of departure approaches, they collect together in\r\ntroops on the chimneys or roofs of houses, and on the tops of trees.\r\nDuring this operation, they keep up an incessant cry, which brings\r\nfamilies of them from all quarters. The young ones try the strength of\r\ntheir wings under the eyes of the parents. Finally, they make some\r\nstrategic dispositions, and elect a chief.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk of the swallows as if they were an army preparing for\r\nbattle, with flags flying, trumpets sounding, and ready to march at\r\nthe word of command.\"\r\n\r\n\"The resemblance between flocks of birds and serried masses of men in\r\nmartial array is striking. Wild ducks, swans, and cranes fly in a kind\r\nof regimental order; their battalions assume the form of a triangle or\r\nwedge, so as to cut through the air with greater facility, and\r\ndiminish the resistance it presents to their flight.\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know it is for that?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could it be for? The leader gives notice, by a peculiar\r\ncry, of the route it is about to take. This cry is repeated by the\r\nflock, as if to say that they will follow, and keep the direction\r\nindicated. When they meet with a bird of prey whose attacks they may\r\nhave to repulse, the ranks fall in so as to present a solid phalanx to\r\nthe enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they had a commissariat in the rear and a few sappers in front,\r\nthe resemblance would be complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a storm arises,\" continued Fritz, without noticing Willis's\r\ncommentary, \"they lower their flight and approach the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgotten their umbrellas, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"When they make a halt, outposts are established to keep a look out\r\nwhile the troop sleeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, in cases of alarm, the outposts fire and fall in as a matter of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Rono,\" said Jack, \"you are become a downright quiz. I have\r\nfinished my letter whilst you have been discussing the poultry,\" he\r\nadded, handing the pen to his brother, \"and it only waits your\r\npostscriptum.\" Fritz having added a few lines, the epistle was sealed,\r\nand was then attached to one of the pigeons, which, after hovering a\r\nshort time round the pinnace, took a flight upwards and disappeared in\r\nthe clouds.\r\n\r\nThey were now in sight of a large island, which bore no traces of\r\nhabitation. There was a heavy surf beating on the shore, but the case\r\nwas urgent, so Willis and Jack embarked in the canoe, and, after a\r\nhard fight with the waves, landed on the beach.\r\n\r\nEach of them were armed with a double-barrelled rifle, and furnished\r\nwith a boatswain's whistle. The whistle was to signal the discovery of\r\nwater, and a rifle shot was to bring them together in case of danger.\r\nThese arrangements being made, Jack proceeded in the direction of a\r\nthicket, which stood at the distance of some hundred yards from the\r\nshore. He had no sooner reached the cover in the vicinity of the trees\r\nthan he was pounced upon by two ferocious-looking savages. They gave\r\nhim no time to level his rifle or to draw a knife. One of his captors\r\nheld his hands firmly behind his back, whilst the other dragged him\r\ntowards the wood. At this moment the Pilot's whistle rang sharply\r\nthrough the air. This put an end to any hopes that Jack might have\r\nentertained of being rescued through that means. Had he sounded the\r\nwhistle, it would only have led Willis to suppose that he had heard\r\nthe signal, and was on his way to join him.\r\n\r\nPoor Jack judged, from the aspect of the men who held him, that they\r\nwere cannibals, and consequently that his fate was sealed, for if his\r\nsurmises were correct, there was little chance of the wretches\r\nrelinquishing their prey. Jack had often amused himself at the expense\r\nof the anthropophagi, but here he was actually within their grasp.\r\nThough death terminates the sorrows and the sufferings of man, and\r\nthough the result is the same in whatever shape it comes, yet there\r\nare circumstances which cause its approach to be regarded with terror\r\nand dismay. In one's bed, exhausted by old age or disease, the lips\r\nonly open to give utterance to a sigh of pain; life, then, is a burden\r\nthat is laid down without reluctance; we glide imperceptibly and\r\nalmost voluntarily into eternity.\r\n\r\nAt twenty years of age, however, when we are full of health and ardor,\r\nthe case is very different. Then we are at the threshold of hope and\r\nhappiness; our illusions have not had time to fade, the future is a\r\nbrilliant meteor sparkling in sunshine. At that age our seas are\r\nalways calm, and the rocks and shoals are all concealed. Our barks\r\nglide jauntily along, the sailors sing merrily, the perils are\r\nshrouded in romance, and the flag flutters gaily in the breeze. Then\r\nlife is not abandoned without a tear of regret.\r\n\r\nTo die in the midst of one's friends is not to quit them entirely.\r\nThey come to see us through the marble or stone in which we are\r\nshrouded. It is another thing to have no other sepulchre than the\r\næsophagus of a cannibal. How the recollections of the past darted into\r\nJack's mind! He felt that he loved those whom he was on the point of\r\nleaving a thousand times more than he did before. What would he not\r\nhave given for the power to bid them one last adieu? The idea of\r\nquitting life thus was horrible.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that he tried to shake off his assailants; his\r\nadolescent strength was as nothing in the arms of steel that bound\r\nhim. He saw that he was powerless in their hands, and at length ceased\r\nmaking any further attempts to escape.\r\n\r\nThe savages, finding that he had relaxed his struggles, commenced to\r\nrifle and strip him. They tore off his upper garments, and discovered\r\na small locket, containing a medallion of his mother, which the\r\nunfortunate youth wore round his neck. This prize, which the savages\r\nno doubt regarded as a talisman of some sort, they both desired to\r\npossess. They quarrelled about it, and commenced fighting over it.\r\nJack's hands were left at liberty. In an instant he had seized his\r\nrifle. He ran a few paces back, turned, took deliberate aim at the\r\nmost powerful of his adversaries, who, with a shriek, fell to the\r\nground. The other savage, scared by the report of the shot and its\r\neffects upon his companion, took to flight, but he carried off the\r\nlocket with him.\r\n\r\nJack had now regained his courage. He felt, like Telemachus in the\r\nmidst of his battles, that God was with him, and he flew, perhaps\r\nimprudently, after the fugitive. Seeing, however, that he had no\r\nchance with him as regards speed, he discharged his second rifle. The\r\nshot did not take effect, but the report brought the savage to his\r\nknees. The frightened wretch pressed his hands together in an attitude\r\nof supplication. Jack stopped at a little distance, and, by an\r\nimperious gesture, gave him to understand that he wanted the locket.\r\nThe sign was comprehended, for the savage laid the talisman on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jack, \"in the name of my mother I give you your life.\"\r\n\r\nBy another sign, he signified to the man that he was at liberty, which\r\nhe no sooner understood than he vanished like an arrow.\r\n\r\nGreat was the consternation of Fritz when he heard the reports; he\r\nfeared that the whole island was in commotion, and that both his\r\nbrother and the Pilot were surrounded by a legion of copper-colored\r\ndevils. From the conformation of the coast he could see nothing, and,\r\nlike Sisiphus on his rock, he was tied by imperious necessity to his\r\npost.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot, on hearing the first shot, ran to the spot, and both he and\r\nJack arrived at the same instant, where the savage lay bleeding on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"You are safe and sound, I hope?\" said Willis, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of some slight contusions, and the loss of my\r\nclothes, thank God, I am all right, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are born to bad luck, it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather we are the spoilt children of Providence. I have just\r\npassed through the eye of a needle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this the only savage you have seen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there were two of them; and, to judge from their actions, I\r\nverily believe the rascals intended to eat me. As for this one, he is\r\nmore frightened than hurt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was, he had escaped with some slugs in his shoulders; but he\r\nseemed, by the contortions of his face, to think that he was dying.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately,\" said Jack, \"my rifle was not loaded with ball. I should\r\nbe sorry to have the death of a human being on my conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Willis, \"I am not naturally cruel, but, beset as you have\r\nbeen, I should have shot both the fellows without the slightest\r\ncompunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said Jack, giving the wounded savage a mouthful of brandy,\r\n\"we ought to have mercy on the vanquished--they are men like\r\nourselves, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have flesh and bone, arms, legs, hands, and teeth like us;\r\nbut I doubt whether they are possessed of souls and hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The chances are that they possess both, Willis; only neither the one\r\nnor the other has been trained to regard the things of this world in a\r\nproper light. Their notions as to diet, for example, arise from\r\nignorance as to what substances are fit and proper for human food.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like,\" said Willis; \"but let us be off; there may be more of\r\nthem lurking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! again without water?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this time I have taken care to fill the casks; the canoe is laden\r\nwith fresh water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fritz must be very uneasy about us; but this man may die if we leave\r\nhim so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" said the Pilot; \"but that is no business of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good bye,\" said Jack, lifting up the wounded savage, and propping him\r\nagainst a tree; \"I may never have the pleasure of seeing you again,\r\nand am sorry to leave you in such a plight; but it will be a lesson\r\nfor you, and a hint to be a little more hospitable for the future in\r\nyour reception of strangers.\"\r\n\r\nThe savage raised his eyes for an instant, as if to thank Jack for his\r\ngood offices, and then relapsed into his former attitude of dejection.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later the canoe was aboard the pinnace.\r\n\r\n\"Fritz,\" said Jack, throwing his arms round his brother's neck, \"I am\r\ndelighted to see you again; half an hour ago I had not the shadow of a\r\nchance of ever beholding you more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE UTILITY OF ADVERSITY--AN ENCOUNTER--THE HOROKEN--BILL ALIAS BOB.\r\n\r\n\r\nA light but favorable breeze carried them away from land, and they\r\nwere once again on the open sea. Willis, after a prolonged\r\ninvestigation of the sun's position, taken in relation to some\r\nobservations he had made the day before, concluded that the best\r\ncourse to pursue, under existing circumstances, was to steer for the\r\nMarian Islands.[H] In addition to the distance they had originally to\r\ntraverse, all the way lost during the storm was now before them. As\r\nregards provisions, they had little to fear; they could rely upon\r\nfalling in with a boobie or sea-cow occasionally, and fresh fish were\r\nto be had at any time. Their supply of water, however, gave them some\r\nuneasiness, for the quantity was limited, and they might be retarded\r\nby calms and contrary winds. The chances of meeting a European ship\r\nwere too slender to enter for anything into their calculations.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me,\" said Jack, one beautiful evening, when they were\r\nsome hundreds of miles from any habitable spot, \"that, having escaped\r\nso many dangers, the watchful eye of Providence must be guarding us\r\nfrom evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly,\" replied Fritz; \"one of the early chroniclers of the\r\nChristian Church says that Lazarus, whom our Saviour resuscitated at\r\nthe gates of Jerusalem, became afterwards one of the most popular\r\npreachers of Christianity, and in consequence the Jews regarded him\r\nwith implacable hatred.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what, in all the world, has that to do with the Pacific Ocean?\"\r\ninquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Very little with the Pacific in particular, but a great deal with\r\nthe ocean in general. Lazarus, his sisters, and some of his friends,\r\nwere thrown into prison, tried, and condemned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And stoned or crucified,\" added Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No; the high priest of the temple had a great variety of punishments\r\non hand besides these. He resolved to expose them to the mercy of the\r\nwaves, without provisions, and without a mast, sail, or rudder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness, we are not so badly off as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He_, for whom Lazarus suffered, and who is the same that nourishes\r\nthe birds of the air and feeds the beasts of the field; watched over\r\nthe forlorn craft; under his guidance, the little colony of martyrs\r\nwere wafted in safety to the fertile coasts of Provence. They landed,\r\naccording to the tradition, at Marseilles, of whom Lazarus was the\r\nfirst bishop, and has always been the patron saint. Who knows?--the\r\nsame good fortune may perhaps await us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not martyrs.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but Providence does not always measure its favors by the merits\r\nof those upon whom they are bestowed--misfortune, alone, is often a\r\nsufficient claim; so it is well for us to be patient under a little\r\nsuffering, for sweet often is the reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little hardship, now and then,\" added Jack, \"is, no doubt,\r\nsalutary. The Italians say: '_Le avversità sono per l'animo cio ch' è\r\nun temporale per l'aria_.' Suffering teaches us to prize health and\r\nhappiness; were there no such things as pain and grief, we should be\r\napt to regard these blessings as valueless, and to estimate them as\r\nour legitimate rights. For my own part, I was never so happy in my\r\nwhole life as when I embraced you the other day, after escaping out of\r\nthe clutches of the savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many charms in life that are almost without alloy: the\r\nperfume of flowers--music--the singing of birds--the riches of\r\nart--the intercourse of society--the delights of the family\r\ncircle--the treasures of imagination and memory. Some of the most\r\nbeneficent gifts of Nature we only know the existence of when we are\r\ndeprived of them; occasional darkness alone enables us to appreciate\r\nthe unspeakable blessing of light. Man has a multitude of enjoyments\r\nat his command; but so many sweets would be utterly insipid without a\r\nfew bitters.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rheumatism, for example,\" said Willis, rubbing his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Many enjoyments,\" continued Fritz, \"spring from the heart alone; the\r\naffections, benevolence, love of order, a sense of the beautiful, of\r\ntruth, of honesty, and of justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand,\" said Willis, \"there are dishonesty, injustice,\r\ndisappointment, and blighted hopes; but you are too young to know much\r\nabout these. When you have seen as much of the world on sea and on\r\nland as I have, perhaps you will be disposed to look at life from\r\nanother point of view. In old stagers like myself, the tender emotions\r\nare all used up; it is only when we are amongst you youngsters that we\r\nforget the present in the past; when we see you struggling with\r\ndifficulties, it recalls our own trials to our mind, rouses in us\r\nsentiments of commiseration, and softens the asperities of our years.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to you, then,\" said Fritz, levelling his rifle at a petrel,\r\n\"the misfortunes of the one constitute the happiness of the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably,\" said Jack; \"for instance, if you miss that bird, so\r\nmuch the worse for you, and so much the better for the petrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very rarely, brother, that you do not interrupt a serious\r\nconversation with some nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your temper, Fritz; I am about to propose a serious question\r\nmyself. How is it that the petrel you are aiming at does not come and\r\nperch itself quietly on the barrel of your rifle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack, Jack, you are incorrigible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see a hare or a pheasant come and stare you in the face\r\nwhen you were going to shoot it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stunsails and tops!\" cried Willis, \"if I do not see something\r\nstranger than that staring us in the face.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea-serpent, perhaps,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was a sea-bird at first,\" said Willis, \"but they do not\r\nincrease in size the longer you look at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They naturally appear to increase as they approach,\" observed Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the increase must have a limit, and I never saw a bird with\r\nsuch singular upper-works before. Just take a cast of the glass\r\nyourself, Master Fritz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halls of Æolus!\" cried Fritz, \"these wings are sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought!\" exclaimed Willis, throwing his sou'-wester into the\r\nair, and uttering a loud hurrah.\r\n\r\n\"If it is the _Nelson_\" said Jack, \"it would be a singular encounter.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Nelson_!\" sighed Willis, \"in the latitude of Hawai; no, that is\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is bearing down upon us,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Just let me see a moment whether I can make out her figure-head,\"\r\nsaid Willis. \"Aye, aye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but, from the sheer of the hull, I think the ship is British\r\nbuilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed both the young men.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may say 'Thank God;' but, if it turns out to be a\r\nman-of-war, I must report myself on board, and I doubt whether my\r\nstory will go down with the captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it is the _Nelson_?\" insisted Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye; the _Nelson_,\" replied Willis, \"is not going to turn up\r\nhere to oblige us, you may take my word for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have better eyes than you, Willis; just let me see if I can make\r\nher out. No, impossible; nothing but the hull and sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just possible,\" persisted Jack, \"that the _Nelson_ may have\r\nbeen detained at the Cape, and afterwards blown out of her course like\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I can say is,\" replied Willis, \"that if Captain Littlestone be on\r\nboard that ship, it will make me the happiest man that ever mixed a\r\nration of grog. But these things only turn up in novels, so it is no\r\nuse talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has hoisted a flag at the mizzen,\" cried Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me see--yes, it must be so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the Union Jack?\" cried Willis.\r\n\r\n\"No, a red ground striped with blue.\"\r\n\r\n\"The United States, as I am a sinner!\" cried Willis. \"Well, it might\r\nhave been worse. We can go to America; there are surgeons there as\r\nwell as in Europe--at all events, we can get a ship there for England.\r\nBut let me see, we must hoist a bit of bunting; unfortunately, we have\r\nonly British colors aboard, and I am afraid they are not in\r\nparticularly high favor with our Yankee cousins just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind a flag,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that will never do, they have hoisted a flag and are waiting a\r\nreply. But let me see,\" added Willis, rummaging amongst some stores,\r\n\"here is one of our Shark's Island signals--that, I think, will puzzle\r\nthe Yankee considerably.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot's signal was answered by a gun, the report of which rang\r\nthrough the air. The strange ship's sails were thrown back and she\r\nstood still. A boat then put off with a young man in uniform and six\r\nrowers on board.\r\n\r\n\"Pinnace ahoy!\" cried the officer through a speaking trumpet, \"who are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shipwrecked mariners,\" cried Fritz, in reply.\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of your craft?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Mary_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware that Switzerland was a naval power,\" observed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"She has no sea-port,\" said Jack, \"but she has a fleet--of row boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you hail from?\" inquired the officer.\r\n\r\n\"New Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\"That gentleman is very curious,\" observed Jack.\r\n\r\nHere a silence of some minutes ensued; the officer seemed at fault in\r\nhis geography.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" at last resounded from the trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"Bound for Europe,\" replied Fritz.\r\n\r\nThis reply elicited an expression of doubt, accompanied with such a\r\ntremendous exjurgation as made both Fritz and Jack almost shrink into\r\nthe hold.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the Yankee in command stepped on board, and\r\nexplanations were entered into that perfectly satisfied the republican\r\nofficer. He continued, however, to eye Willis curiously.\r\n\r\nThe _Hoboken_, for that was the name of the strange ship, was an\r\nAmerican cruiser, carrying twelve ship guns and a long paixhan. She\r\nwas attached to the Chinese station, but had recently obtained\r\ninformation that war had been declared between England and the States.\r\nShe was now making her way to the west by a circuitous route to avoid\r\nthe British squadron, and, at the same time, with a view to pick up an\r\nEnglish merchantman or two.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack being citizens of a sister republic, and subjects of a\r\nneutral power, were received on board with a hearty welcome, and with\r\nthe hospitality due to their interesting position. Willis also\r\nreceived some attention, and was treated with all the courtesy that\r\ncould be shown to the native of an enemy's country.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was taken in tow till the young men made up their minds as\r\nto the course they would adopt. A free passage to the States was\r\nkindly offered to them, and even pressed upon their acceptance; but\r\nthe captain left the matter entirely to their own option.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were delighted with the warmth of their reception; and,\r\nafter being so long cooped up in the narrow quarters of the pinnace,\r\nlooked upon the Yankee cruiser, with its men and officers in uniform,\r\nas a sort of floating palace. The _Nelson_ having been only a\r\ndespatch-boat, it had given them but an indifferent idea of a\r\nman-of-war. On board the Yankee every thing was kept in apple-pie\r\norder. Discipline was maintained with martinet strictness. The\r\nfittings shone like a mirror. The brass cappings glistened in the sun.\r\nComplicated rolls of cable were profusely scattered about, but without\r\nconfusion. The deck always seemed as fresh as if it had been planked\r\nthe day before. The sails overhead seemed to obey the word of command\r\nof their own accord. The boatswain's whistle seemed to act upon the\r\nmen like electricity. The seamen's cabins, six feet long by six feet\r\nbroad, in which a hammock, locker, and lashing apparatus were\r\nconveniently stowed, were something very different from the\r\naccommodation on board the pinnace. These things were regarded by\r\nFritz and Jack with great interest; and nowhere is the genius of man\r\nso brilliantly displayed as on board a well-appointed ship of war.\r\n\r\nThe young men, however, when they sat down to dinner in the captain's\r\ncabin, and beheld a long table flanked with cushioned seats, commanded\r\nat each end by arm-chairs, the side-board plentifully garnished with\r\nplate and crystal of various kinds, fastened with copper nails to\r\nprevent damage from the ship's pitching, they did not reflect that\r\nthey were in the crater of a volcano, and that two paces from where\r\nthey sat there was powder enough to blow the ship and all its crew up\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nThey were likewise highly amused by the perpetual \"guessing,\"\r\n\"calculating,\" \"reckoning,\" and inexhaustible curiosity of the crew;\r\nbut their admiration of the ship, her guns, her stores, and her\r\ntackle, were boundless; they felt that their pinnace was a mere toy in\r\ncomparison. The urbanity of the officers also was a source of much\r\ngratification to them; Jack even declared that all the civilization of\r\nEurope had been shipped on board the _Hoboken_, and in so far as that\r\nwas concerned, they had no occasion to go on much further.\r\n\r\nThe object of this expedition, however, was a surgeon. There was one\r\non board. Would he go to New Switzerland? Jack determined to try, and\r\naccordingly he walked straight off to the personage in question.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said he, \"would you do myself and my brother a great favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; and, if it is in my power, you may consider it done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, will you embark with us for New Switzerland?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother is laboring under a malady, which there is every reason to\r\nfear is cancer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose a fever was to break out in this ship whilst I am\r\nabsent, what do you imagine is to become of the officers and crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no symptoms of disease on board; but my mother is dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, young man, that disease may make its appearance at any\r\nmoment. There are many sons on board whose lives are as dear to their\r\nmothers as your mother's is to you, and for every one of these lives I\r\nam officially accountable.\"\r\n\r\nJack hung down his head and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"No, my good friend, it is impossible for me to grant such a request;\r\nbut, from what I know of your history, and the means at your command,\r\nyou may be able to obtain the services of a competent medical man. I\r\nwould, therefore, recommend you to abandon your boat, and proceed with\r\nus to our destination.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy consultation, the two brothers and Willis determined\r\nto adopt this course. The cargo of the pinnace was accordingly\r\ntransferred to the hold of the _Hoboken_. A short summary of their\r\nhistory was written, corked up in a bottle, and fastened to the mast\r\nof the _Mary_, which was then cut adrift. A tear gathered on the\r\ncheeks of the young men as they saw their old friend in adversity\r\ndropping slowly behind, and they did not withdraw their eyes from it\r\ntill every vestige of its hull was lost in the shadows of the waters.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz and Jack were thus engaged in gazing listlessly on the ocean,\r\nand reflecting upon their altered prospects, and perhaps trying to\r\npenetrate the veil of the future, Willis came towards them rubbing his\r\nbreast, as if he had been seized with a violent internal spasm.\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa,\" cried Jack, \"the Pilot is sea-sick! Shall I run for some\r\nbrandy, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, stop a bit; we were in hopes of falling in with Captain\r\nLittlestone, were we not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were disappointed, were we not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That has not made you ill, has it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; somebody else has turned up; there is one of the _Nelson's_ crew\r\non board this ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the _Nelson's_ crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and if you only knew how my heart beat when I saw him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can easily conceive your feelings,\" said Jack, \"for my own heart\r\nhas almost leaped into my mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am thunderstruck,\" added Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"I went towards my old friend,\" continued Willis, \"with tears in my\r\neyes, threw my arms round him, and gave him a hearty but affectionate\r\nhug.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, at first; but, as soon as I left his arms at liberty, he\r\ngave me such a punch in the ribs as almost doubled me in two; it was\r\nenough to knock the in'ards out of a rhinoceros--ugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"A blow in earnest?\" exclaimed Fritz in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there was no mistake about it; it was a real, good, earnest John\r\nBull knock-down thump; it put me in mind of Portsmouth on a pay\r\nday--ugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely touching,\" said Jack, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Then, when I called him by his name Bill Stubbs, and asked what had\r\nbecome of the sloop, he said that he knew nothing at all about the\r\nsloop, and swore that he had never set his eyes on my figure-head\r\nbefore, the varmint--ugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Odd,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of your man?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"But you say his name is Bill, whilst he declares his name is Bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, he has evidently been up to some mischief, and changed his\r\nticket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what conclusion do you draw from the affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am completely bewildered, and scarcely know what to think; perhaps\r\nthe crew has mutinied, and turned Captain Littlestone adrift on a\r\ndesert island. That is sometimes done. Perhaps--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no use perhapsing those sort of melancholy things,\" said Fritz;\r\n\"we may as well suppose, for the present, that Captain Littlestone is\r\nsafe, and that your friend has been put on shore for some\r\nmisdemeanour.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be, may be, Master Fritz; and I hope and trust it is so. But to\r\nhave an old comrade amongst us, who could give us all the information\r\nwe want, and yet not to be able to get a single thing out of him--\"\r\n\r\n\"Except a punch in the ribs,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; and a punch that will not let me forget the lubber in a\r\nhurry,\" added Willis, clenching his fist; \"but I intend, in the\r\nmeantime, to keep my weather eye open.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks after this episode the _Hoboken_ was slowly wending her\r\nway along the bights of the Bahamas. Fritz, Jack, and Willis were\r\nwalking and chatting on the quarter-deck. The sky was of a deep azure.\r\nThe sea was covered with herbs and flowers as far as the eye could\r\nreach--sometimes in compact masses of several miles in extent, and at\r\nother times in long straight ribbons, as regular as if they had been\r\nspread by some West Indian Le Notre. The ship seemed merely displaying\r\nher graces in the sunshine, so gentle was she moving in the water. The\r\nair was laden with perfumes, and a soft dreamy languor stole over the\r\nfriends, which they were trying in vain to shake off. In one direction\r\nrose the misty heights of St. Domingo, and in another the cloud-capped\r\nsummits of Cuba. Sometimes the highest peaks of the latter pierced the\r\nveil that enveloped them, and seemed like islands floating in the sky,\r\nor heads of a race of giants.\r\n\r\n\"The air here is almost as balmy and fragrant as that of New\r\nSwitzerland,\" remarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" said the Pilot; \"but it is not all gold that glitters: in\r\nthese sweet smells a nasty fever is concealed, with which I have no\r\nwish to renew my acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, talking about acquaintances, Willis, have you obtained\r\nany further intelligence from your friend Bill, _alias_ Bob?\" inquired\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\"No, not a syllable; the viper is as cunning as a fox, and keeps his\r\nmouth as close as a mouse-trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"He seems as obstinate as a mule, and as obdurate as a Chinaman into\r\nthe bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that, and more than that; but,\" added Willis, \"I have found out\r\nfrom the mate that he was pressed on board this ship at New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pressed on board?\" said Fritz, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is a mode of recruiting for the navy peculiar to England\r\nand the United States. Would you like to hear something about how the\r\nsystem is carried out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Willis, very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"The transactions, however, that I shall have to relate are in no way\r\ncreditable, either to myself or anybody else connected with them; and\r\nI am afraid, when you hear the particulars, you will be ready to turn\r\nround and say, your friend the Pilot is no good after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you, then, been desperately wicked, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that depends entirely upon the view you take of what I am to\r\ntell you. Listen.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] Sometimes called the _Ladrones_ or _Archipelago of Saint Lazarus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH WILLIS SHOWS, THAT THE TERM PRESS-GANG MEANS SOMETHING ELSE\r\nBESIDES THE GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When I was a youngster, about a year or two older than you are now,\r\nMaster Fritz, I slipped on board the brig _Norfolk_ as boatswain's\r\nmate. The ship at the time was short of hands, so there was no\r\nimmediate probability of her weighing anchor; but on the same day I\r\nscratched my name on the books a despatch arrived, in consequence of\r\nwhich we left the harbor, and proceeded out to sea under sealed\r\norders. One day, when off the Irish coast, I was called aft by the\r\nfirst lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"'You know something of Cork, my man, I believe?' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, your honor, I have been ashore there once or twice,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Very good,' said he; 'get ready to go ashore there again as quick as\r\nyou like.'\r\n\r\n\"Leave to go on shore is always agreeable to a sailor. He prefers the\r\nsea, but likes to stretch himself on land now and then, just to enjoy\r\na change of air, and look about him a bit; so it was with all possible\r\nexpedition that I made the requisite preparations.\r\n\r\n\"When I reappeared, I found a party of twenty men mustered on deck in\r\npipe-clay order. A full ration of small arms was served out to them,\r\nand, under the command of the lieutenant, we embarked in the long-boat\r\nand rowed ashore. We landed at a point of the coast some miles distant\r\nfrom Cork, and it was dark before we reached the military barracks of\r\nthat town, which, for the present, appeared to be our destination.\r\n\r\n\"I had not the slightest idea of what we were to do on shore. From our\r\nbeing so heavily armed, I knew it was no mere escort or parade duty\r\nthat was in question, and began to think there was work of some kind\r\non hand. This gave me no kind of uneasiness. I only wondered whatever\r\nit could be, for there was clearly a mystery of some kind or other.\r\nWere we going to besiege Paddy, in his own peaceable city of Cork? Had\r\nsome of the peep-o'-day boys been burning down farmer Magrath's ricks\r\nagain? or was there a private still to be routed out and demolished? I\r\ncould not tell.\r\n\r\n\"Half an hour after our arrival, I was called into a private room by\r\nthe lieutenant, who was seated at a table with a package of clothes\r\nbeside him. The first lieutenant of the _Norfolk_, I must remark, was\r\na bit of an original. He had won his way up to the rank he then held\r\nfrom before the mast. His build was rather squat, and his face was\r\ngarnished with a pair of fiery red whiskers, so he was no beauty,\r\nadded to which he was reckoned one of the most rigid martinets in the\r\nservice; yet, for all that, his crew liked him, for they knew his\r\nheart was in the right place.\r\n\r\n\"'See, my man,' said he, 'take this package, and rig yourself out in\r\nthe toggery it contains.'\r\n\r\n\"I obeyed this order, and soon after stood before him, in a pair of\r\njack-boots, with a slouching sort of tarpauling hat on my head, so\r\nthat I might either have passed for a manner out of luck or a dustman.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said the lieutenant, laughing, 'now you have quite the air of\r\nthe hulks about you.'\r\n\r\n\"This remark not being very complimentary, I did not feel called upon\r\nto make any reply.\r\n\r\n\"'You know,' he continued, 'that the brig is short about a dozen\r\nhands, and I want you to pick up a few likely lads here. I understand\r\nthere are a number of able-bodied seamen skulking about the\r\npublic-houses, where they will likely remain as long as their money\r\nlasts. I should like to secure as many of them as possible, and then\r\ncapture a few stout landsmen to make up the number; but, in the first\r\nplace, I want you to go and find out the best place to make a razzia.'\r\n\r\n\"I stared when I found myself all at once promoted to the post of\r\npioneer for a party of kidnappers, and muttered something or other\r\nabout honor.\r\n\r\n\"'Honor, sir!' roared the lieutenant, 'what has honor to do with it,\r\nsir? It is duty, sir. It is the laws of the service, sir, and you must\r\nobey them, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'But it is hard, your honor,' said I, 'that the laws of the service\r\nshould force men to do what they think is wrong.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what right, sir, have you to think it is wrong, or to judge the\r\nacts of your superiors? If the laws of the service order you fifty\r\nlashes at the yard-arm to-morrow, you will find that you will get\r\nthem. Do you want to be handed over to the drummer, and to cultivate\r\nan acquaintance with the cat?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, your honor,' said I, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The lieutenant's face by this time was as red as his whiskers, and,\r\nthough he was in a towering rage, he quickly calmed down again, like\r\nboiling milk when it is taken off the fire.\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said he, quietly, 'am I to understand you refuse?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, your honor,' said I. 'If it is my duty, I must obey; but you\r\nwill pardon the liberty, when I say that it is hard to be forced to\r\ndrag away a lot of poor fellows against their wills.'\r\n\r\n\"'Look ye,' replied the lieutenant, 'I tolerate your freedom of speech\r\nfor two reasons--the first, because we are here alone, and no harm is\r\ndone; the second, because I entertain the same opinion myself; but,\r\nmind you, we are both bound by the regulations of the service, and it\r\nis mutiny for either of us to disobey.'\r\n\r\n\"According to the moral law, the mission with which I was charged\r\ncould scarcely be considered honorable; but, according to the laws of\r\nthe land, or rather of the sea, it was perfectly unexceptionable.\r\nAmongst the seamen, a foray amongst the landlubbers was regarded more\r\nin the light of a spree than anything else. If, indeed, it were\r\npossible to pick up the lazy and idle amongst the population, this\r\nmode of enlistment might be useful; but often the industrious head of\r\na family was seized, whilst the idle escaped. It was rare, however,\r\nthat a ship's crew were employed in this sort of duty; men were more\r\nusually obtained through the crimps on shore, who often fearfully\r\nabused the authority with which they were invested for the purpose. As\r\nfor myself, the lieutenant's arguments removed all my scruples, if I\r\never had any.\r\n\r\n\"I then suggested a plan of operations, which was approved. The men\r\nwere to be kept ready for action, and the lieutenant himself was to\r\nawait my report at the 'Green Dragon,' one of the hotels in the town.\r\n\r\n\"At that time there was in the outskirts of Cork a sort of tavern and\r\nlodging-house, called the 'Molly Bawn.' This establishment was\r\nfrequented by the lowest class of seamen and 'tramps.' Thither I\r\nwended my way. It was late when I arrived in front of the place; and\r\nwhilst hesitating whether I should venture into such a precious\r\nmenagerie, I happened to look round, and, by the light of a dim lamp\r\nthat burned at the corner of the street, I caught a glimpse of the\r\nlieutenant leaning against the wall, quietly smoking an Irish dudeen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Rono the Great in the island of Hawai,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Something. This, however, cut short my deliberations. I walked in.\r\nThere was a crowd of men and women drinking and smoking about the bar.\r\nThese, however, were not the people I sought. The regular tenants of\r\nthe house were not amongst that lot, and it was essential for me to\r\nfind out in what part of the premises they were stowed. I commenced\r\nproceedings by ordering a noggin of whisky, and making love to the\r\ndamsel that brought it in. After having formally made her an offer of\r\nmarriage, I asked after the landlord. She told me he was engaged with\r\nsome customers, but offered to take a message to him.\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said I, 'just tell him that a friend of One-eyed Dick's would\r\nlike to have a parley with him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And who was One-eyed Dick?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"One of the crew of a piratical craft captured by one of our cruisers\r\na few months before, and who at that time was safely lodged in\r\nPortsmouth jail.\r\n\r\n\"The girl soon returned. She told me to walk with her, and led me\r\nthrough some narrow passages into what appeared to be another house.\r\nShe knocked at a door that was strongly barred and fastened inside. A\r\nslight glance at these precautions made me aware that there was no\r\nchance of making a capture here without creating a great disturbance.\r\nSo, after reflecting an instant, I decided upon adopting some other\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\"When the door was opened I could see nothing distinctly; there was a\r\nturf-fire throwing a red glare out of the chimney, a dim oil-lamp hung\r\nfrom the roof, but everything was hidden in a dense cloud of tobacco\r\nsmoke, through which the light was not sufficiently powerful to\r\npenetrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The atmosphere must have been stifling,\" observed Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it puts me in mind of your remark about the air, which, you\r\nsaid, consists of--let me see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oxygen and hydrogen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; but the air a sailor breathes when he is at home consists\r\nalmost entirely of tobacco smoke. At last, I could make out twenty or\r\nthirty rough-looking fellows seated on each side of a long deal table\r\ncovered with bottles, glasses, and pipes. Dan Hooligan, the landlord,\r\nsat at the top--a fit president for such an assembly. He was partly a\r\nsmuggler, partly a publican, and wholly a sinner. I should say that\r\nthe liquor consumed at that table did not much good to the revenue.\r\nHow Dan contrived to escape the laws, was a mystery perhaps best known\r\nto the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you are a pal of One-eyed Dick's, are you?' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'Rather,' said I, adopting the slang of the place.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said he, 'Dick has been a good customer of mine, and all his\r\npals are welcome at the 'Molly.' I have not seen him lately,\r\nhowever--how goes it with him now?'\r\n\r\n\"'Right as a trivet,' said I, 'and making lots of rhino.'\r\n\r\n\"'Glad to hear it; and what latitude does he hail in now?'\r\n\r\n\"'That,' said I, 'is private and confidential.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' said he, 'there are no outsiders here, we are all sworn friends\r\nof Dick's, every mother's son of us.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said I, 'Dick is off the Cove in the schooner _Nancy_, of\r\nBrest,'\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa, Willis,\" cried Jack, \"there was a fib!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I told you to look out for something of that sort when I\r\nbegan.\"\r\n\r\n\"'What!' cried the landlord, 'Dick in a schooner off the Irish coast?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said I; 'and aboard that schooner there is as tight a cargo of\r\nbrandy and tobacco as ever you set eyes upon.'\r\n\r\n\"Here the landlord pricked up his ears, and the rest of the company\r\nbegan to listen attentively. The fellow that sat next me coolly told\r\nme that both he and Dick had been lagged for horse-stealing, and had\r\nsubsequently broken out of prison and escaped. He further told me that\r\nmost of the gentlemen present had been all, one way or another, mixed\r\nup with Dick's doings; from which I concluded they were a rare parcel\r\nof scamps, and resolved, within myself, to try and bag the whole\r\nsquad. They were all stout fellows enough, most of them seamen. I\r\nthought they might be able to 'do the State some service,' and\r\ndetermined to convert them into honest men, if I could.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dick cannot come ashore,' said I; 'some one of his old pals here has\r\npeached, and there is a warrant out against him.'\r\n\r\n\"This information threw the assembly into a state of violent\r\ncommotion. They rose up, and swore terrible vengeance against the head\r\nof the unfortunate culprit when they caught him. The oaths rather\r\nalarmed me at first, for they were of a most ferocious stamp.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' continued I, 'Dick is aboard the schooner, but, as there are\r\ntwo or three warrants out against him, he does not care about coming\r\nashore; so said he to me, 'We want a lugger and a few hands to run the\r\ncargo ashore; and if you look in at the 'Molly,' and see my old pal,\r\nDan, perhaps you will find some lads there willing to give us a turn.\r\nThe captain said, if the thing was done clean off, he would stand\r\nsomething handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Just the thing for us!' shouted half a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\"'But the lugger?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Phil Doolan, at the Cove, has a craft that has landed as many\r\ncargoes as there are planks in her hull. Besides, he has stowage for a\r\nfleet of East Indiamen.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, gentlemen,\" said I, 'the chaplain, One-eyed Dick, and myself,\r\nwill be at Phil Doolan's to-morrow at midnight; do you agree to meet\r\nus there?'\r\n\r\n\"This question was answered by a universal 'Yes;' and by way of\r\nclenching the affair, I ordered a couple of gallons of the stiffest\r\npotheen in the house. This was received with three cheers, and before\r\nI left the 'Molly' every man-jack of them had disappeared under the\r\ntable. Dan himself, however, kept tolerably sober, and promised, on\r\naccount of his friendship for One-eyed Dick, to have the whole kit\r\nsafe at Phil Doolan's by twelve o'clock next night, and with this\r\nassurance I made my exit from the premises, and steered for the\r\n'George and Dragon.'\r\n\r\n\"The lieutenant agreed with me in thinking that it would cause too\r\nmuch uproar to attack the 'Molly Bawn.' He congratulated me on my\r\nsuccess in laying a trap for the people, and promising to meet me at\r\nthe Cove, he ordered a car, and drove off in the direction of the\r\n_Norfolk's_ boat. Early next morning I started to reconnoitre the\r\nground and organize my plan of operations. I found Phil Doolan's\r\nmansion to be a mud-built tenement, larger, and standing apart from,\r\nthe houses that then constituted the village. It was ostensibly a\r\nsailor's lodging-house and tavern for wayfarers, but, like the 'Molly\r\nBawn,' was in reality a rendezvous of smugglers, occasionally\r\npatronized by fugitive poachers and patriots. It was known to its\r\nfamiliars as 'The Crib,' but was registered by the authorities as the\r\n'Father Mahony,' who was represented on the sign-post by a full-length\r\nportrait of James the Second. What gave me most satisfaction was to\r\nobserve that the building was conveniently situated for a sack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"When night set in I marched the _Norfolk's_ men in close order,\r\nand as secretly as possible, to the Cove. Approaching Phil Doolan's in\r\none direction, I could just catch a glimpse of the red coats of a file\r\nof marines advancing in another, with the lieutenant at their head,\r\nand, exactly as twelve o'clock struck on the parish clock, the 'Father\r\nMahony' was surrounded on all sides by armed men. Two or three\r\nlanterns were now lit, and dispositions made to close up every avenue\r\nof escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"'There he is!' cried Willis, interrupting himself, and staring into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" inquired Jack--\"Phil Doolan?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--Bill Stubbs, late of the _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"That squat, broad-shouldered man there, bracing the maintops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, now that you point him out, I think I have seen him before,\"\r\nsaid Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Holloa, Bill,\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Willis, \"he turned his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"How d'ye do, Bill?\" added Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Are you speak'ng to me, sir?\" inquired the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then was your honor present when I was christened? I appear to have\r\nforgotten my name for the last six-and thirty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use, you see,\" said Willis; \"he is too old a bird to be caught by\r\nany of these dodges. But I have lost the thread of my discourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had surrounded the cabin, and were lighting lamps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a dozen men were stationed at the door, pistol in hand, ready to\r\nrush in as soon as it opened. The lieutenant and I went forward and\r\nknocked, but no one answered. We knocked again, louder than before,\r\nbut still no answer.\r\n\r\n\"'Open the door, in the King's name!' thundered the lieutenant.\r\nSilence, as before.\r\n\r\n\"Calling to the marines, he ordered them to root up Phil Doolan's\r\nsign-post, and use it as a battering ram against the door. The first\r\nblow of this machine nearly brought the house down, and a cracked\r\nvoice was heard calling on the saints inside.\r\n\r\n\"'Blessed St. Patrick!' croaked the voice, 'whativer are ye kicking up\r\nsuch a shindy out there for? Whativer d'ye want wid an old woman, and\r\nniver a livin' sowl in the house 'cept meself and Kathleen in her\r\ncoffin?'\r\n\r\n\"'Kathleen is dead, then?' said the lieutenant with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"'Save yer honor's presence, she's off to glory, an' as dead as a\r\nherrin,' replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\"'Really!' said the lieutenant, 'and where is Phil Doolan?'\r\n\r\n\"'Och, yer honor? he's gone to get some potheen for the wake.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said the lieutenant, 'I should like to take a share in waking\r\nthe defunct--what's her name?'\r\n\r\n\"'Kathleen, yer honor.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, just let us in to take a last look at the worthy creature.'\r\n\r\n\"The door then creaked on its rusty hinges, and we entered. Not a\r\nsoul, however, was to be seen anywhere, save and except the old woman\r\nherself. The coffin containing the remains of Kathleen, resting on two\r\nstools, stood in the middle of the floor, with a plate of salt as\r\nusual on the lid. I fairly thought I had been done, and looked upon\r\nmyself as the laughing stock of the entire fleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far,\" remarked Jack, \"your story has been all right, but the last\r\nepisode was rather negligently handled.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you did not make enough of the coffin scene; your description is\r\ntoo meagre. You should have said, that the wind blew without in fierce\r\ngusts, the weathercocks screeched on the roofs, and caused you to\r\ndread that the ghost of the defunct was coming down the chimney; large\r\nflakes of snow were rushing through the half-open door; a solitary\r\nrushlight dimly lit up the chamber, and cast frightful shadows upon\r\nthe wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; but the night was fine, and there was not a breath of wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about that? A little wind, more or less, a weathercock or so,\r\nsome drops of rain, or a few flakes of snow, do not materially detract\r\nfrom the truth, whilst they heighten the color of the picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if some lightning tearing through the clouds were added?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that would most undoubtedly increase the effect; but go on with\r\nyour story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew Phil to be an artful dodger, and was determined not to be\r\nfoiled by a mere trick, so I laid hold of a lantern and closely\r\nexamined the walls and flooring. My investigation was successful, for\r\njust under the coffin I detected traces of a trap-door.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Well, my good woman, what have you got down there?\" inquired the\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"'Is it underground, ye mane, yer honor? divil a hail's there, if it\r\nisn't the rats.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, just remove the coffin a little aside; we shall see if we\r\ncannot pepper some of the rats for you.'\r\n\r\n\"Here the old woman appealed to a vast number of saints, and protested\r\nagainst Kathleen's remains being disturbed. The lieutenant, however,\r\ngrew tired of this farce, and ordered the coffin to be shifted. A\r\nsailor accordingly laid hold of each end.\r\n\r\n\"'Blazes!' said one, 'here is a body that weighs.'\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps,' said the other, 'the coffin is lined with lead.'\r\n\r\n\"The trap-door was drawn up, and the lieutenant, pistol in hand,\r\ndescended alone.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, my lads,' said he, addressing some invisible personages, 'we\r\nknow you are here, and I call upon you to yield in the King's\r\nname--resistance is useless, the house is surrounded, and we are in\r\nforce, so you had better give in without more ado.'\r\n\r\n\"No answer was returned to this exordium; but we heard the murmuring\r\nof muffled voices, as if the rapscallions were deliberating. I now\r\ndescended with my lamp, followed by some of the seamen, and beheld my\r\nfriends of the night before either stretched on the ground or propped\r\nup against the walls, like a lot of mummies in an Egyptian tomb.\r\n\r\n\"They were handcuffed one by one, pushed or hauled up the stairs, and\r\nthen tied to one another in a line. When we had secured the whole lot\r\nof them in this way--\r\n\r\n\"'Lieutenant,' said I, winking, 'will you permit me to send a ball\r\ninto that coffin?'\r\n\r\n\"'Please yourself about that, young man,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"Here the old woman recommenced howling again and called upon all the\r\nsaints in the calendar to punish us for my sacrilegious design.\r\n\r\n\"'Shoot a dead body,' said I, 'where's the harm?' Besides, what is\r\nthat salt there for?'\r\n\r\n\"'To keep away evil spirits,' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"'Very well,' said I, 'my pistol will scare them away as well.' Then,\r\ncocking it with a loud clink, I presented it slowly at the coffin.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lid all at once flew off--the salt-was thrown on the ground with\r\na crash--the defunct suddenly returned from the other world in perfect\r\nhealth, and sat half upright in his bier. I did not recognize the\r\nindividual at first, but, on closer inspection, found him to be my\r\ncommunicative companion of the preceding night--the horse-stealer of\r\nthe 'Molly Bawn;' and, being a stout young fellow, he was harnessed to\r\nthe others, and we commenced our march to the boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not appear to have had much trouble in effecting the capture,\"\r\nremarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"No; the men were unarmed, and were nearly all intoxicated. You never\r\nsaw such a troop; scarcely one of them could walk straight; they\r\nassumed all sorts of figures; the file of prisoners was just like a\r\nbar of music, it was a string of quavers, crotchets, and zig-zags.\r\nLuckily, it was late at night, else we might have had the village\r\nabout our ears, and, instead of flakes of snow and screeching\r\nweathercocks, we might have had a shower of dead cats and rotten eggs.\r\nProbably a rescue might have been attempted; at all events, we might\r\nhave calculated on a volley of brickbats on our way to the boats.\r\nThere would have been no end of commotion, uproar, confusion, and\r\nhubbub, possibly smashed noses, blackened eyes, broken beads--\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa, Willis!\"\r\n\r\n\"You said just now that a little colouring was necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; but the privilege ought not to be abused. Besides, broken\r\nheads and smashed faces are the realities, and not the accessories of\r\nthe picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see. If it is night, the moon should be introduced; and if it\r\nis day, the sun--and so on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; and, if the circumstances are of a pleasing nature, you\r\nmust leave horrors and terrors on your pallette; change gusts into\r\nzephyrs, snow into roses and violets, and the weathercocks into golden\r\nvanes glittering in the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to color a popular outbreak, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you should introduce a tempest howling, the waves roaring, the\r\nlightning flashing, and discord raging in the air as well as on the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to continue my story. Although it was midnight, the disturbance\r\nbegan to wake up the villagers, and a crowd was collecting, so we\r\nhurried off our prisoners to the boats as speedily as we could. Some\r\nfive and twenty able bodied men were thus added to his Majesty's\r\nfleet. The object of our visit to the Irish coast was accomplished,\r\nand the _Norfolk_ continued her voyage to the West Indies. Now you\r\nknow what is meant by the word _pressed_, and likewise the nautical\r\nsignification of the word _press-gang_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say that Bill Stubbs has been trapped on board this ship by\r\nsuch means?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to your story, then, that does not say very much in his\r\nfavor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a great deal; still, that proves nothing--the fact of his\r\ncalling himself Bob is a worse feature. A man does not generally\r\nchange his name without having good, or rather bad, reasons for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What appears to me,\" remarked Fritz, \"as the most singular feature of\r\nyour press-gang adventure is, that you are alive to tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I think it ought to end thus: 'The victims of the press-gang\r\nstrangled Willis a few days after,'\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, but you do not know what a sailor is; our recruits had not\r\nbeen a fortnight at sea before they entirely forgot the trick I had\r\nplayed them.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Willis concluded his narrative, the man at the mast-head\r\ncalled out, \"Sail ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" bawled the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Right a-head,\" replied the voice.\r\n\r\nThe _Hoboken_ had hitherto pursued her voyage uninterruptedly, and the\r\nYankee captain now prepared to signalize himself by a capture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA SEA FIGHT--ANOTHER IDEA OF THE PILOT'S--THE BOUDEUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Hoboken_ was rather pleased than otherwise when\r\nthe look-out reported the strange sail to show English colors. He\r\nlooked rather glum, however, half an hour afterwards, when the same\r\nvoice bawled that she was a bull-dog looking craft, schooner-rigged,\r\nand pierced for sixteen guns. The Yankee had hoped to fall in with a\r\nfat West Indiaman, instead of which he had now to deal with a\r\nman-of-war, carrying, perhaps, a larger weight of metal than himself.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the two ships were standing in towards each other, there\r\nwas no wind to speak of, but every hour lessened the distance that\r\nseparated the antagonists.\r\n\r\n\"Pilot,\" said the captain, addressing Willis, \"be kind enough to let\r\nme know what you think of that craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Willis, taking the telescope, \"I have had my eyes on\r\nher before. Aye, aye, just as I thought. An old tub of a Spaniard\r\nconverted into an English cruiser, and commanded by Commodore\r\nTruncheon, I shouldn't wonder. She has caught a Tartar this time,\r\nhowever. Nothing of a sailer. If a breeze springs up, you may easily\r\ngive her the slip, if you like, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give her the slip! No, not if I can help it. My cruise hitherto has\r\nnot been very successful, and I must send her into New York as a\r\nprize. Mr. Brill,\" added he, addressing the officer next in command,\r\n\"prepare for action.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was commotion and bustle on deck. Half an hour\r\nafter, the captain, now in full uniform, took a hasty glance at the\r\nposition of his crew. A portion of the men were stationed at the guns,\r\nwith lighted matches. Others were engaged in heating shot, and\r\npreparing other instruments of destruction. Jack and Fritz, armed with\r\nmuskets, were ready to act as sharp-shooters as soon as the enemy came\r\nwithin range, and Willis was standing beside them, with his hands in\r\nhis pockets, quietly smoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"What, Pilot!\" exclaimed the captain in passing, \"don't you intend to\r\ntake part in the skirmish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am much your debtor, captain, but I cannot do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And these young men?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not Englishmen, and your kindness to them entitles you to\r\nclaim their assistance. I am sorry that honor and duty prevent me\r\ngiving you mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter, captain,\" said Fritz, \"my brother and myself will do duty\r\nfor three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Pilot, you had better go below.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your permission, captain, I would rather stay and look on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the use of exposing yourself here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an idea of mine, captain. But I shall remain perfectly neutral\r\nduring the engagement.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like then, Pilot, as you like,\" said the captain, as he\r\nresumed his place on the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a cannon ball whistled through the air.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Willis; \"the commodore gives the signal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That shot,\" observed Jack, \"passed at no great distance from your\r\nhead, Willis. You had better take a musket in self-defence. Besides,\r\nthat ship is English, and you are a Scotchman.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship is a Spaniard by birth,\" replied Willis, \"and it is pretty\r\nwell time it was converted into firewood, for the matter of that. But\r\nit is the flag, my boy--_that_ is neither Spanish nor English.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"It is the union-jack, Master Fritz. It is the ensign of Scotland,\r\nEngland, and Ireland united under one bonnet; and as such, it is as\r\nsacred in my eyes as if it bore the cross of St. Andrew.\"\r\n\r\nMusket balls were now rattling pretty freely amongst the shrouds. The\r\nyoung men levelled their muskets and fired.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the two ships were abreast of each other, and almost at\r\nthe same instant both discharged a deadly broadside. The conflict\r\nbecame general. The crashing of the woodwork and the roaring of the\r\nguns was deafening. A thick smoke enveloped the two vessels, so that\r\nnothing could be seen of the one from the other; still the firing and\r\ncrashing went on. The sails were torn to shreds, the deck was\r\nencumbered with fragments of timber; men were now and then falling,\r\neither killed or wounded, and a fatigue party was constantly engaged\r\nin removing the bodies. There are people who consider such a spectacle\r\nmagnificent; but that is only because they have never witnessed its\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\nAlready many immortal souls had returned to their Maker; many sons had\r\nbecome orphans, and many wives had been deprived of their husbands;\r\nbut as yet there was nothing to indicate on which side victory was to\r\nbe declared. Soon, however, a cry of fire was raised, which caused\r\ngreat confusion; and another cry, announcing that the captain had\r\nfallen, increased the disorder.\r\n\r\nA ball crashed through the taffrail, near where Jack and Fritz were\r\nstanding; it passed between them, but they were both severely wounded\r\nby the splinters, and were conveyed by Willis to the cockpit. The\r\ndoctor, seeing his old friend Jack handed down the ladder, hastened\r\ntowards him and tore out a piece of wood from the fleshy part of his\r\narm. He next turned to Fritz, who had received a severe flesh-wound on\r\nthe shoulder. When both wounds were bandaged, he left the care of the\r\nyoung men to Willis, who had escaped with a few scratches, which,\r\nhowever, were bleeding pretty freely--to these he did not pay the\r\nslightest attention.\r\n\r\n\"How stands the contest?\" inquired Fritz in a weak voice.\r\n\r\n\"The _Hoboken_ is done for,\" replied Willis; \"the commodore was\r\npreparing to board when we left the deck; but it does not make much\r\ndifference; we shall go to England instead of America, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"God's will be done,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\nJust then Bill Stubbs was swung down in a hammock; both his legs had\r\nbeen shot off by a cannon ball. The surgeon could only now attend to a\r\ntithe of his patients, so numerous had the wounded become. A glance at\r\nthe new comer satisfied him that he was beyond all human skill, and he\r\ndirected his attention to the cases that promised some hopes of\r\nrecovery. Willis, seeing that his old comrade was abandoned to die\r\nalmost uncared for, staunched his wounds as well as he could, fetched\r\nhim a panniken of water, and performed a number of other little acts\r\nof kindness and good will. This he did, less with a view of obtaining\r\nan explanation from him at a moment when no man lies, than to mitigate\r\nthe pangs of his last convulsions. For an instant the old mariner's\r\nbody appeared re-animated with life. His eyes were fixed upon Willis\r\nwith an ineffable expression of recognition and regret. He\r\nconvulsively grasped the Pilot's hand and pressed it to his breast,\r\nand his lips parted as if to speak. Willis bent his ear to the mouth\r\nof the dying man, but all that followed was an expiring sigh. His\r\nearthly career was ended.\r\n\r\nThe hardy sailor who is supposed never to shed a tear, then wiped the\r\ncorner of his eyes. Next he turned to the children of his adoption,\r\nwhose pale faces indicated the amount of blood they had shed, and\r\nwhose wounds, if he could have transferred them to himself, would have\r\nless pained his powerful muscles than they now grieved his excellent\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nA party of boarders from the enemy had taken possession of the ship.\r\nWillis reported himself to the officer in command, and at his request,\r\nFritz and Jack, together with the cargo of the pinnace, were conveyed\r\non board the victorious schooner. Shortly after the _Hoboken_ was\r\ndespatched to Bermuda as a prize, with the prisoners, the wounded, and\r\nthe dying.\r\n\r\nThe old tub that had gained this victory was named the _Arzobispo_,\r\nhaving, as Willis supposed, been captured in the Spanish Main. It was\r\nunder the command of Commodore Truncheon, better known in the fleet by\r\nthe _soubriquet_ of Old Flyblow.\r\n\r\nThe _Arzobispo_, though old and clumsy, was a stout-built craft; and\r\nso thick was its hide, that the broadsides of the Yankee had done the\r\nhull no damage to speak of. The superstructure, however, was\r\ncompletely shattered; the masts and rigging hung like sweeps over the\r\nsides; and, to the unpractised eye, the ship was a complete wreck. A\r\nfew days, however, sufficed to put everything to rights again so far\r\nas regards external appearance; but how this impromptu carpentry would\r\nstand a storm was another question.\r\n\r\nThe commodore was on his way to Europe when he fell in with the\r\nYankee, and, notwithstanding the disabled condition of the ship, he\r\nresolved to continue his voyage. Some of the officers expostulated\r\nwith him on the hazard of crossing the Atlantic in so shaky a trim. He\r\nonly got red in the face, and said that he had crossed the\r\nherring-pond hundreds of times in crafts not half so seaworthy. He was\r\nlike the\r\n\r\n  Froggy who would a wooing go,\r\n  Whether his mother would let him or no.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this defiance of advice were fatal to Old Flyblow;\r\nfor, a week or two after his victory, he was pounced upon by the\r\nFrench corvette, _Boudeuse_, which was fresh, heavily armed, and well\r\nmanned. The commodore's jury masts were knocked to pieces by the first\r\nbroadside, his flag went by the board, and he was completely at the\r\nenemy's mercy. Willis lent a hand this time with a good will; but it\r\nwas of no use, the wreck would not obey the helm, and the corvette\r\nhovered about, firing broadsides, and sending in discharges of\r\nmusketry, when and where she liked. It was only when the commodore saw\r\nclearly that there was neither mast nor sail enough to yaw the ship,\r\nthat he waved his cocked hat in token of surrender.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were still confined below with their wounds, when\r\nWillis brought them word that they would have to shift themselves and\r\ntheir cargo once more. The captain received them on board the\r\n_Boudeuse_ with marked courtesy, and informed them that he was bound\r\ndirect for Havre de Grace.\r\n\r\n\"It seems, then,\" said the Pilot, \"that neither America nor England\r\nis to be our destination after all. But never mind, there are no lack\r\nof surgeons amongst the _mounseers_.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we go on this way much longer,\" said Jack, sighing, \"we shall be\r\ncarried round the world without arriving anywhere. Alas, my poor\r\nmother!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nDELHI--WILLIAM OF NORMANDY AND KING JOHN--ISABELLA OF BAVARIA AND JOAN\r\nOF ARC--POITIERS AND BOVINES--HISTORY OF A GHOST, A GRIDIRON, AND A\r\nCHEST OF GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first the three adventurers were regarded as prisoners of war;\r\nwhen, however, their entire history came to be known, and their\r\nextraordinary migrations from ship to ship authenticated, they were\r\nlooked upon as guests, and treated as friends.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I had only obtained possession of an English cruiser,\" said\r\nthe captain; \"but I find I have also acquired the right of being\r\nuseful to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander of the _Boudeuse_ was a very different sort of a person\r\nfrom Commodore Truncheon; the former treated his men as if every one\r\nof them had a title and great influence at the Admiralty, whilst the\r\nlatter swore at his crew as if the word of command could not be\r\nunderstood without a supplementary oath. The English commodore might\r\nbe the better sailor of the two, but certainly the French captain\r\ncarried off the palm as regards politeness, urbanity, and gentlemanly\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nThe wounds of Fritz and Jack were healing rapidly under the skilful\r\ntreatment of the French surgeon, and, with a lift from Willis, they\r\nwere able to walk a portion of the day on deck. With reviving health,\r\ntheir cheerful hopes of the future returned, their dormant spirits\r\nwere re-awakened, and their minds regained their wonted animation.\r\n\r\n\"The corvette spins along admirably,\" said the Pilot, \"and is steering\r\nstraight for the Bay of Biscay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Jack sighing, \"it is very easy to steer for a place, but it\r\nis not quite so easy to get there. I am sick of your friend the sea,\r\nWillis; and would give my largest pearl for a glimpse of a town, a\r\nvillage, or even a street.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to see a street in all its glory, Master Jack, you must\r\ntry and get the captain to alter his course for Delhi.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I should think, Willis, that there is nothing in the\r\nstreet-scenery of Delhi to compare with the Boulevards of Paris,\r\nRegent-street in London, or the Broadway of New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg your pardon there, Master Jack; I know every shop window in\r\nRegent-street; I have often been nearly run over in the Broadway, and\r\ncan easily imagine the turn out on the Boulevards; but they are\r\nsolitudes in comparison with an Indian street.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not that there are more inhabitants, nor on account of\r\nthe traffic, for no streets in the world will beat those of London in\r\nthat respect--it is because the people live, move, and have their\r\nbeing in the streets; they eat, drink, and sleep in the streets; they\r\nsing, dance, and pray in the streets; conventions, treaties, and\r\nalliances are concluded in the streets; in short, the street is the\r\nIndians' home, his club, and his temple. In Europe, transactions are\r\nnegotiated quietly; in India, nothing can be done without roaring,\r\nscreaming, and bawling.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be plenty of deaf people there,\" observed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but there are no dumb people. Added to the endless\r\nvociferations of the human voice, there is an eternal barking of dogs,\r\nelephants snorting, cows lowing, and myriads of pigs grunting. Then\r\nthere is the thump, thump of the tam-tam, the whistling of fifes, and\r\nthe screeching of a horrible instrument resembling a fiddle, which can\r\nonly be compared with the Belzebub music of Hawai. If, amongst these\r\ndiscordant sounds, you throw in a cloud of mosquitoes and a hurricane\r\nof dust, you will have a tolerable idea of an Indian street.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be animation and life enough, Willis, but I should prefer\r\nthe monotony of Regent-street for all that. Would you like to air\r\nyourself in Paris a bit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but not just now; the less my countrymen see of France, under\r\npresent circumstances, the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is England and France always fighting about, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe the cause this time to be a shindy the _mounseers_\r\ngot up amongst themselves in 1788. They first cut off the head of\r\ntheir king, and then commenced to cut one another's throats, and\r\nEngland interfered.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" observed Fritz, \"may be the immediate origin of the present\r\nwar [1812]. But for the cause of the animosity existing between the\r\ntwo nations, you must, I suspect, go back as far as the eleventh\r\ncentury, to the time of William, Duke of Normandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had he to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal. He claimed a right, real or pretended, to the English\r\nthrone. He crossed the Channel, and, in 1066, defeated Harold, King of\r\nEngland, at the battle of Hastings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both William and Harold were originally Danes, were they not?\"\r\ninquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I think Rollo, William's grandfather, was a Norman adventurer,\r\nor sea-king, as these marauders were sometimes called. William, after\r\nthe victory of Hastings, proclaimed himself King of England and Duke\r\nof Normandy, and assumed the designation of William the Conqueror.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how did France get mixed up in the affair?\" inquired Willis.\r\n\r\n\"William's grandfather, when he seized the dukedom cf Normandy, became\r\nvirtually a vassal of the King of France, though it is doubtful\r\nwhether he ever took the trouble to recognize the suzerainty of the\r\nthrone. As sovereign, however, the King of France claimed the right of\r\nhomage, which consisted, according to feudal usage, in the vassal\r\nadvancing, bare-headed, without sword or spurs, and kneeling at the\r\nfoot of the throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was this right ever enforced?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in one case at least. John Lackland--or, as the French called\r\nhim, John Sans Terre--having assassinated his nephew Arthur, Duke of\r\nBrittany, in order to obtain possession of his lands, was summoned by\r\nPhilip Augustus, King of France, to justify his crime. John did not\r\nobey the summons, was declared guilty of felony, and Philip took\r\npossession of Normandy. Thus the first step to hostilities was laid\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"The English having lost Normandy, the vassalage ceased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so far as regards Normandy; but, in the meantime, Louis le\r\nJeune, King of France, unfortunately divorced his wife, Elenor of\r\nAquitaine, who afterwards married an English prince, and added\r\nGuienne, another French dukedom to the English crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"So another vassalage sprung up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. All the French King insisted upon was the homage; but Edward\r\nIII. of England, instead of bending his knee to Philip of Valois,\r\nargued with himself in this way: 'If I were King of England and France\r\nas well, the claim of homage for the dukedom of Guienne would be\r\nextinguished.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather cool that,\" said Jack, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"'We shall then,' Edward said to himself, 'be our own sovereign, and\r\ndo homage to ourself, which would save a deal of bother.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was right there, at least,\" remarked the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"The King of France, however, entertained a different view of the\r\nsubject. Hence arose an endless succession of sieges, battles,\r\nconquests, defeats, exterminations, and hatreds, which, no doubt, gave\r\nrise to the ill-feeling that exists at present between England and\r\nFrance. It is curious, at the same time, to observe what mischief\r\nindividual acts may occasion. If William of Normandy had remained\r\ncontented with his dukedom, and Louis le Jeune had not divorced his\r\nwife, France would not have lost the disastrous battles of Agincourt\r\nand Poitiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor gained the brilliant victory of Bovines,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; but she would have been spared the indignity of having\r\none of her kings marched through the streets of London as a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but, on the other hand, the captured monarch would not have\r\nhad an opportunity of illustrating the laws of honor in his own\r\nperson. He returned loyally to England and resumed his chains, when he\r\nfound that the enormous sum demanded by England for his ransom would\r\nimpoverish his people: otherwise he could not have given birth to the\r\nmaxim, 'That though good faith be banished from all the world beside,\r\nit ought still to be found in the hearts of kings.'\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the kings of Scotland,\" remarked Willis, \"was placed in a\r\nsimilar position. The Scottish army had been cut to pieces at the\r\nbattle of Flodden, the king was captured in his harness, conveyed to\r\nLondon, and the people had to pay a great deal more to obtain his\r\nfreedom than he was worth. But, before that, the Scotch nearly caught\r\none of the Edwards. This time the English army had been cut to pieces;\r\nbut the king did not wait to be captured, he took to his heels, or\r\nrather to his horse's hoofs. He was beautifully mounted, and followed\r\nby half a dozen Scottish troopers; away he went, over hill and dale,\r\nditch and river. Dick Turpin's ride from London to York was nothing to\r\nit. The king proved himself to be a first-rate horseman, for, after\r\nbeing chased this way over half the country, he succeeded in baffling\r\nhis pursuers. All these escapades between England and Scotland are,\r\nhowever, forgotten now, or at least ought to be; there are, doubtless,\r\na few thick-headed persons in both sections of the empire who delight\r\nin keeping alive old prejudices, but they will die out in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, however, they have not died away yet,\" said Fritz, \"in so\r\nfar as regards France and England, since the two countries are at war\r\nagain. But, as I observed before, had it not been for the ambition of\r\nWilliam and the anti-connubial propensities of John, the English would\r\nnever have been masters of Paris, and a great part of France under\r\nCharles VI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, in that case,\" persisted Jack, \"Charles VII. would not have\r\nhad the opportunity of liberating his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Fritz, \"history would not have had to record the\r\nshameless deeds of Isabella of Bavaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor chronicle the brilliant achievements of Joan of Arc,\" added Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Any how,\" observed Willis, \"the mounseers are a curious people. I\r\nhave heard it remarked that they are occupied all day long in getting\r\nthemselves into scrapes, and that Providence busies herself all night\r\nin getting them out again.\"\r\n\r\nBy chatting in this way, Fritz, his brother, and the Pilot contrived\r\nto relieve the monotony of the voyage, and to pass away the time\r\npleasantly enough. Each contributed his quota to the common fund;\r\nFritz his judgment, Jack his humor, and Willis his practical\r\nexperience, strong good sense, and vigorous, though untutored\r\nunderstanding. A portion of Jack's time was passed with the surgeon,\r\nbetween whom a great intimacy had sprung up. Time did not, therefore,\r\nhang heavily on the hands of the young men; for even during the night\r\ntheir thoughts were busy forming projects, or in embroidering the\r\ncanvas of the future with those fairy designs which youth alone can\r\ncreate.\r\n\r\nOne morning Willis arrived on deck, pale, and with an air of fatigue\r\nand lassitude altogether unusual. He gazed anxiously into every nook\r\nand cranny of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is the matter, Willis?\" inquired Jack. \"Have you seen the\r\nFlying Dutchman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Master Jack,\" said he in a forlorn tone; \"but I have either seen\r\nthe captain or his ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the captain of the _Hoboken_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the captain of the _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my eyes were as wide open as they are now; he looked into my\r\ncabin, and spoke to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you it is the case though, impossible or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he then?\" exclaimed both the young men, starting.\r\n\r\n\"That I know not; I have looked for him everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"At first he said, How d'ye do, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally; and what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He asked me what I thought of the cloud that was gathering in the\r\nsouth-west.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imagination, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look there, you can see a storm is gathering in that quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nightmare, Willis. But what did you say to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not answer at the moment; my tongue clove to the roof of my\r\nmouth, and I rose to take hold of his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he disappeared, did he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I heard the door of my cabin shut behind him, as distinctly as I\r\nnow hear the waves breaking on the sides of the corvette at this\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have run after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did you catch him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I was stopped by the watch, for I had nothing on me but my shirt;\r\nthe officers stared, the sailors laughed, and the doctor felt my\r\npulse. But, for all that, I am satisfied there is a mystery\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Willis, the thing is altogether improbable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look here; Captain Littlestone is either dead or alive, is he\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"there can be no medium between these\r\nhypotheses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all I can say is this, that as sure as I am a living sinner, I\r\nhave seen him if he is alive, and, if he is dead, I have seen his\r\nghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe in visitations from the other world then, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot discredit the evidences of my own senses, can I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, this brings to my recollection a similar circumstance that\r\nhappened to an old comrade of mine. Sam Walker is as fine a fellow as\r\never lived, he sailed with me on board the _Norfolk_, and I know him\r\nto be incapable of telling a falsehood. Though his name is Sam\r\nWalker, we used to call him 'Hot Codlins.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he had an old woman with a child tatooed on his arm, instead\r\nof an anchor, as is usual in the navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A portrait of _Notre Dame de Bon Lecours_, I shouldn't wonder,\" said\r\nJack; \"but what had that to do with hot codlins: a codlin is a fish,\r\nis it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain that another time,\" said Willis, the shadow of a smile\r\npassing over his pale features. \"The short and the long of the story\r\nis, that Sam once saw a ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us all about it, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am afraid you will not believe the story if I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I promise to believe it in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Master Jack. Did you ever see a windmill?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I know what sort of things they are from description.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are none in Scotland,\" continued Willis; \"at least I never saw\r\none there.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do they manage to grind their corn then? There should be oats in\r\nthe land o' cakes, at all events,\" said Jack, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in countries that have plenty of water, they can dispense with\r\nmills on land. Though there are no wind-mills in Scotland, there are\r\nsome in the county of Durham, on the borders of England, for it\r\nappears my mate Sam was born in one of them. His father and mother\r\ndied when he was very young, and he, conjointly with the rats, was\r\nleft sole owner and occupant of the mill. Some of the neighboring\r\nvillagers, seeing the poor boy left in this forlorn condition, got him\r\ninto a charity school, whence he was bound apprentice to a shipmaster\r\nengaged in the coal trade, by whom he was sent to sea. The ship young\r\nSam sailed in was wrecked on the coast of France, and he fell into the\r\nhands of a fisherman, who put the mark on his arm we used to joke him\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said Jack; \"the mark in question represents the patron\r\nsaint of French sailors.\"\r\n\r\n\"After a variety of ups and downs, Sam found himself rated as a\r\nfirst-class seaman on board a British man-of-war. He served with\r\nmyself on board the _Norfolk_, and was wounded at the battle of\r\nTrafalgar [1806], which, I dare say, you have heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Willis, it was there that your Admiral Nelson covered himself\r\nwith immortal renown.\"\r\n\r\n\"There and elsewhere, Master Fritz.\"\r\n\r\n\"It cost him his life, however, Willis, and likewise shortened those\r\nof the French Admiral Villeneuve and the Spanish Admiral Gravina;\r\nthat, you must admit, is too many eggs for one omelet.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you once said yourself, great victories are not won without loss,\r\nand the battle of Trafalgar was no exception to the rule. Sam, having\r\nbeen wounded, was sent to the hospital, and when his wound was healed,\r\nhe was allowed leave of absence to recruit his strength, so he thought\r\nhe would take a run to Durham and see how it fared with the paternal\r\nwindmill. Time had, of course, wrought many changes both outside and\r\nin, but it still remained perched grimly on its pedestal, but now\r\nentirely abandoned to the bats and owls. The sails were gone, and the\r\nwoodwork was slowly crumbling away; but the basement being of hewn\r\ngranite, it was still in a tolerable state of preservation. The place,\r\nhowever, was said to be haunted; exactly at twelve o'clock at night\r\ndismal howls were heard by the villagers to issue from the mill.\r\nAccording to the blacksmith, who was a great authority in such\r\nmatters, Sam's father was a very avaricious old fellow, and had hid\r\nhis money somewhere about the building; and you know, Master Jack,\r\nthat when a man dies and leaves his money concealed, there is no rest\r\nfor him in his grave till it is discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really was not aware of it before,\" replied Jack; \"but I am\r\ndelighted to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Sam arrived, nobody disputed his title to the property, except\r\nthe ghost; but Sam had seen a good deal of hard service, and declared\r\nthat he would not be choused out of his patrimony for all the ghosts\r\nin the parish; and, in spite of the persuasions of the villagers,\r\nresolved to take up his abode there forthwith. Sam accordingly laid in\r\na supply of stores, including a month's supply of tobacco and rum. He\r\nfirst made the place water-tight, then made a fire sufficient to roast\r\nan ox, and when night arrived made a jorum of grog, a little stiff, to\r\nkeep away the damp. This done, he lit his pipe, and began to cook a\r\nsteak for his supper. The old mill, for the first time since the\r\ndecease of the former proprietor, was filled with the savory odor of\r\nroast beef.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there are worse odors than that,\" remarked Jack. \"Whilst the\r\nsteak was frizzling, he took a swig at the grog; and, thinking one\r\nside was done, he gave the gridiron a twist, which sent the steak a\r\nlittle way up the chimney, and, strange to say, it never came down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"'Ten thousand What's-a-names,' cried Sam, 'where's my steak?'\r\n\r\n\"No answer was vouchsafed to this query; he looked up the chimney, and\r\ncould see no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The steak had really disappeared then?\" said Jack, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, not a fragment remained; but he had more beef, so he cut off\r\nanother; and, as his head had got a little middled with the grog, he\r\nthought it just possible that he might have capsized the gridiron into\r\nthe fire, so he quietly recommenced the operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second steak disappeared like the first?\" \"Yes, Master Fritz,\r\nwith this difference--there was a dead man's thigh-bone in its place.\"\r\n\r\n\"An awkward transformation for a hungry man,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"'Here's a go!' cried Sam, like to burst his sides with laughing,\r\n'they expect to frighten me with bones, do they? they've got the wrong\r\nman--been played too many tricks of that kind at sea to be scared by\r\nthat sort of thing. Ha, ha, ha! capital joke though.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Your friend Sam must have been a merry fellow, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he was hungry, and wanted his supper; so he continued\r\nsupplying the gridiron with steaks as long as the beef lasted, but\r\nonly obtained human shin-bones, clavicles and tibias.\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind,' said Sam to himself, 'they will tire of this game in\r\ncourse of time.'\r\n\r\n\"When the beef was done, he kept up a supply of rashers of bacon, and\r\nthrew the bones as they appeared in a corner, consoling himself in the\r\nmeantime with his pipe and his grog.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have been both patient and persevering,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"This went on till a skull appeared on the gridiron.\"\r\n\r\n\"A singular object to sup upon,\" observed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"'I wonder what the deuce will come next,' said Sam to himself,\r\nthrowing the skull amongst the rest of the bones.\r\n\r\n\"The next time, however, he took the gridiron off the fire, there was\r\nhis last rasher done to a turn.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' said Sam, 'I am going to have peace and quietness at last.'\r\n\r\n\"He sat down then very comfortably, and kept eating and drinking, and\r\ndrinking and smoking, till the village clock struck twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Jack. \"You may come in now, ladies and gentlemen; the\r\nperformance is just a-going to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam heard a succession of crack cracks amongst the bones, and turning\r\nround he beheld a frightful-looking spectre, pointing with its finger\r\nto the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it wrapped up in a white sheet?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I rather think it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I believe the story; for spectres are invariably\r\nwrapped up in white sheets.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bones, instead of remaining quietly piled up in the corner, had\r\njoined themselves together--the leg bones to the feet, the ribs to the\r\nback-bone--and the skull had stuck itself on the top. Where the flesh\r\ncame from, Sam could not tell; but he strongly suspected that his own\r\nsteaks and bacon had something to do with it. But, be that as it may,\r\nthere was not half enough of fat to cover the bones, and the figure\r\nwas dreadfully thin. Sam stared at first in astonishment, and began to\r\ndoubt whether he saw aright. When, however, he beheld the figure move,\r\nthere could be no mistake, and he knew at once that it was a ghost.\r\nAnybody else would have been frightened out of their senses, but Sam\r\ntook the matter philososophically and went on with his supper.\r\n\r\n\"'How d'ye do, old fellow?' he said to the spectre. 'Will you have a\r\nmouthful of grog to warm your inside? Sit down, and be sociable.'\r\n\r\n\"The spectre did not make any reply, but continued making a sign for\r\nSam to follow.\r\n\r\n\"'If you prefer to stand and keep beckoning there till to-morrow you\r\nmay, but, if I were in your place, I would come nearer the fire,' said\r\nSam; 'you may catch cold standing there without your shirt, you know.'\r\n\r\n\"The same silence and the same gesture continued on the part of the\r\nghost, and Sam, seeing that his words produced no effect, recommenced\r\neating.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing,\" remarked Jack, \"more astonishing about your\r\nfriend Sam than his coolness, and that is his appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\"The spectre did not appear satisfied with the state of affairs, for\r\nit assumed a threatening attitude and strode towards the fire-place.\r\n\r\n\"'Avast heaving, old fellow,' cried Sam, 'there is one thing I have\r\ngot to say, which is this here: you may stand and hoist signals there\r\nas long as ever you like; but if you touch me, then look out for\r\nsqualls, that's all.'\r\n\r\n\"The 'old fellow,' however, paid no attention to this caution. He\r\nstrode right up to the fire-place, and, whilst pointing to the door\r\nwith one hand, grasped Sam's arm with the other. Sam started up, shook\r\noff the hand that held him, and pitched into the spectre right and\r\nleft. But, strange to say, his hands went right through its bones and\r\nall, just as if it had been made of the hydrogen gas you spoke of the\r\nother day. Sam saw that it was no use laying about him in this\r\nfashion, for the spectre stood grinning at him all the time, so he\r\ngave it up.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish,' said he, 'you would be off, and go to bed, and not keep\r\nbothering there.'\r\n\r\n\"Still the spectre maintained the same posture, and kept\r\npertinaciously pointing to the door.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said Sam, 'since you insist upon it, let us see what there is\r\noutside. Go a-head, I will follow.'\r\n\r\n\"The spectre led him into what used to be the garden of the mill, but\r\nthe enclosure was now overgrown with rank and poisonous weeds. There\r\nwas a path running through it paved with flagstones; the spectre\r\npointed with its finder to one of them. Sam stooped down, and, much to\r\nhis astonishment, raised it with ease. Beneath there was an iron\r\nchest, the lid of which he also opened, and saw that it was filled\r\nwith old spade guineas and Spanish dollars.\r\n\r\n\"'You behold that treasure!' said the spectre, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\"'Ha, ha, old fellow! you can speak, can you? Now we shall understand\r\neach other. Yes, I see a box, filled with what looks very like gold\r\nand silver coins.'\r\n\r\n\"'I placed that treasure there before my death,' added the spectre.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, so! than you are dead?' said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"'One half of that money I wish you to give to the poor, and the other\r\nhalf you may keep to yourself, if you choose.'\r\n\r\n\"'Golley!' said Sam, 'you are not much of a swab after all, though you\r\nlook as thin as a purser's clerk. Give us a shake of your paw, my\r\nhearty.'\r\n\r\n\"Here Sam, somehow or other, stumbled over the lamp, and when he got\r\nup again the spectre had vanished. He laid hold of the chest, however,\r\nand groped his way back to the mill. When safe inside, he made a stiff\r\njorum of grog, and then fell comfortably asleep. That night he dreamt\r\nthat he was eating gold and silver, that he was his own captain, that\r\nthe cat-o'-nine tails was entirely abolished in the navy, and that his\r\nship, instead of sailing in salt water was floating in rum. When he\r\nawoke, the sun was steaming through all the nooks and crannies of the\r\nold mill. All the marks of the preceding night's adventures were\r\nthere--the gridiron, the empty rum jar, the the table o'erturned in\r\nthe _mélée_ with the ghost--but the chest of money was gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did Sam conclude from that incident?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he supposed that he had slept rather long, and that somebody\r\nhad come in before he as up and had walked off with the box.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had been in his place,\" continued Fritz, \"I should have said to\r\nmyself that the mind often gives birth to strange fancies,\r\nparticularly after a heavy supper, and that I had muddled my brain\r\nwith rum; consequently, that all the things I imagined I had seen were\r\nonly the chimeras of a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that could not be, Master Fritz, for two reasons; the first, that\r\nthe mark of the ghost's hand remained on his arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely burnt it when he grilled the bacon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The second, that the ghost was no more seen or heard of in the mill.\"\r\n\r\n\"That proof is a poser for you, brother, I think,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Did you heave that sigh just now, Master Fritz?\" inquired Willis, in\r\na low tone.\r\n\r\n\"It was not I,\" said Fritz, looking at his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Jack, looking at Willis.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Willis, looking behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIS FALLS IN WITH THE SLOOP ON TERRA FIRMA, INSTEAD OF AT THE\r\nBOTTOM OF THE SEA, AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED--ADMIRAL CICERO--THE\r\nDEFUNCT NOT YET DEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corvette, notwithstanding the multitude of British cruisers\r\nscattered about the ocean, and the other dangers that beset her, held\r\non the even tenor of her way. A gale sprung up now and then, but they\r\nonly tended to give a filip to the common-place incidents recorded in\r\nthe log. This quietude was not, however, enjoyed by all the persons on\r\nboard. Willis was a prey to violent emotions; and so it often happens,\r\nin the midst of the profoundest calm, storms often rage in the heart\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nWhether in reality or in a dream, Willis declared that Captain\r\nLittlestone paid him a visit every night, and invariably asked him\r\nprecisely the same questions. On these occasions, Willis asserted that\r\nhe distinctly heard the door open and shut whilst a shadow glided\r\nthrough. That he might once, or even twice, have been the dupe of his\r\nown imagination, is probable enough; but a healthy mind does not\r\npermit a delusion to be indefinitely prolonged--it struggles with the\r\nhallucination, and eventually shakes it off; providing always the mind\r\nhas a shadow, and not a reality, to deal with, and that the patient is\r\nnot a monomaniac. The dilemma was consequently reduced to this\r\nposition--either Willis was mad, or Captain Littlestone was on board\r\nthe _Boudeuse_.\r\n\r\nIn all other respects, Willis was perfectly sane. He himself searched\r\nevery corner of the ship, but without other result than a confirmation\r\nof his own impression that there were no officers on board other than\r\nthose of the corvette; and yet, notwithstanding his own conviction in\r\ndaylight, he still continued to assert the reality of his interviews\r\nwith Captain Littlestone during the night. The Italians say, _La\r\nsperanza è il sogno d'an uomo svegliato_. Was Willis also dreaming\r\nwith his eyes open? Might not the wish be father to the thought, and\r\nthe thought produce the fancy? There is only one other supposition to\r\nbe hazarded--could it be possible, in spite of all his researches,\r\nthat Willis did see what he maintained with so much pertinacity he had\r\nseen?\r\n\r\nThese questions are too astute to admit of answers without due\r\nconsideration and reflection; therefore, with the reader's permission,\r\nwe shall leave the replies over for the present.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th June a voice from the mast-head called \"Land ahoy!\" much\r\nto the delight of the voyagers. The land in question was the island of\r\nSt. Helena. This sea-girt rock had not at that time become classic\r\nground. It had not yet become the prison and mausoleum of Napoleon the\r\nGreat. The petulant squabbles between Sir Hudson Lowe and his\r\nillustrious prisoner had not been heard of. Little wotted then the\r\nproud ruler of France the fate that awaited him, for, when the\r\n_Boudeuse_ touched at the island, all Europe, with the single\r\nexception of England, was kneeling at his feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th the Island of Ascension was reached. Here, in accordance\r\nwith a usage peculiar to French sailors, a bottle, containing a short\r\nabstract of the ship's log, was committed to the deep. Willis thought\r\nthis ceremony, under existing circumstances, would have been better\r\nobserved in the breach than the observance, for, said he, if a British\r\ncruiser picked up that bottle within twenty-four hours, she stood a\r\nchance of picking up the _Boudeuse_ as well.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th July the peak of Teneriffe hove in sight This remarkable\r\nbasaltic rock rises to the extraordinary height of three thousand\r\neight hundred yards above the level of the sea; it is consequently\r\nseen at a considerable distance, and constitutes a valuable landmark\r\nfor navigators in these seas. Six weeks later the _Boudeuse_ dropped\r\nanchor in the Havre roads.\r\n\r\nHere the three adventurers had to encounter by far the greatest\r\nmisfortune that had as yet befallen them. The continental system of\r\nNapoleon was then in force. The importation of everything English or\r\nIndian was strictly prohibited. The cargo the young men had brought\r\nwith them from New Switzerland, which already had escaped so many\r\nperils, was, therefore, declared contraband, and seized by the French\r\n_fisc_--an institution that rarely permitted such a prize to quit its\r\nrapacious grasp.\r\n\r\nBehold now our poor friends, Fritz and Jack, in a strange land,\r\ndeprived at once of their fortune and their chance of returning\r\nhome--the two beacons that had cheered them on their way! All their\r\nbright hopes of the future were thus annihilated at one fell swoop.\r\nTheir fortitude almost gave way under the severity of this blow; the\r\nexcess of their distress alone saved them. Grief requires leisure to\r\ngive itself free vent; but when we are compelled, by absolute\r\nnecessity, to earn our daily bread, we cannot find time for tears; and\r\nsuch was the case with Willis and his two friends; they were here\r\nwithout a friend and without resources of any kind whatever.\r\n\r\nIf they had only known Greek and Latin; if they had only been half\r\ndoctors or three-quarter barristers, or if even they had been doctors\r\nand lawyers complete, it would have sorely puzzled their skill to have\r\nraised a single sous in hard cash. Fortunately, however, whilst\r\ncultivating their minds, they had acquired the art of handling a saw\r\nand wielding a hammer. The blouse of the workman, consequently, fitted\r\nthem as well as the gown of the student, and they set themselves\r\nmanfully to earn a living by the sweat of their brow. They were\r\ncarpenters and blacksmiths by turns, regulating their occupations by\r\nthe grand doctrines of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nJack alone of the three was defective in steadiness; he only joined\r\nWillis and his brother at mid-day. What he did with himself during the\r\nforenoon was a profound mystery. He rose before daybreak, and\r\ndisappeared no one knew where, or for what purpose. His companions in\r\nadversity endeavored in vain to discover his secret; he was determined\r\nto conceal his movements, and succeeded in baffling their curiosity.\r\nTo judge, however, by the ardor with which he worked, he was engaged\r\nin some one of those schemes that are termed follies before success,\r\nbut which, after success, are universally acknowledged to be brilliant\r\nand praiseworthy instances of industrial enterprise.\r\n\r\nIf, after a hard day's work, when assembled together in the little\r\nroom that served them for parlor, kitchen, and hall, the power of\r\nregret vanquished fatigue, and sadness drove away sleep, then Jack,\r\nwho compared himself to Peter the Great, when a voluntary exile in the\r\nshipyards of Saardam, would endeavor to infuse a little mirth into the\r\nlugubrious party. If all his efforts to make them merry failed, all\r\nthree would join together in a humble prayer to their Heavenly Father,\r\nwho bestowed resignation upon them instead.\r\n\r\nIf Willis and his two friends were not accumulating wealth, at all\r\nevents they were earning the bread they ate honestly and worthily.\r\nThey had all three laid their shoulders vigorously to the wheel and\r\nkept it jogging along marvellously for a month. By that time, a\r\ndetailed report of the seizure of their property had been placed\r\nbefore the director of the Domaine Extraordinaire, who was the\r\nsovereign authority in all matters pertaining to the exchequer of the\r\nempire. He saw at once that this capture was extremely harsh, and\r\nprobably thought that, if it became known, it would raise a storm of\r\nindignation about the ears of his department. Here were two young\r\nmen--Moseses, as it were, saved from the bulrushes. Lost in the desert\r\nfrom the period of their birth, and ignorant of the dissensions then\r\nraging in Europe, they were unquestionably beyond the ordinary\r\noperation of the law. This will never do, he probably said to himself;\r\nthe civilization which these two young men have come through so many\r\nperils to seek ought not to appear to them, the moment they arrived in\r\nEurope, in the form of spoliation and barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe name of this _extraordinary_ director of Domaine Extraordinaire\r\nwas M. de la Boullerie, and, when we fall in with the name of a really\r\ngood-hearted man, we delight to record it. He felt that the two young\r\nmen had been hardly dealt with, but he had not the power to order a\r\nrestitution of the property, now that the seizure had been made, and\r\nsundry perquisities, of course, deducted by the excise officials.\r\nAccordingly, he referred the matter to the Emperor, who commanded the\r\ngoods to be immediately restored intact. Napoleon, at the same time,\r\npraised the functionary we have named for calling his attention to the\r\nmerits of the case, and thanked him for such an opportunity of\r\nrepairing an injustice.[I]\r\n\r\nThere are many such instances of generosity as the foregoing in the\r\ncareer of the great Emperor--mild rays of the sun in the midst of\r\nthunderstorms; sweet flowers blowing here and there, in the bosom of\r\nthe gigantic projects of his life--which many will esteem more highly\r\nthan his miracles of strategy and the renown of his battles. As\r\nnothing that tends to elevate the soul is out of place in this volume,\r\nwe may be permitted to insert one or two of these anecdotes.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Napoleon was at Potsdam. The Prussians were humbled to the\r\ndust, and the outrage of Rossbach had been fearfully avenged. A letter\r\nwas intercepted, in which Prince Laatsfeld, civil governor of Berlin,\r\nsecretly informed the enemy of all the dispositions of the French\r\narmy. The crime was palpable, capital, and unpardonable. There was\r\nnothing between the life and death of the prince, except the time to\r\nload half a dozen muskets, point them to his breast, and cry--Fire.\r\nThe princess flew to the palace, threw herself at the feet of the\r\nEmperor, beseeched, implored, and seemed almost heart-broken. \"Madam,\"\r\nsaid Napoleon, \"this letter is the only proof that exists of your\r\nhusband's guilt. Throw it into the fire.\" The fatal paper blazed,\r\ncrisped, passed from blue to yellow, and the treachery of Prince\r\nLaatsfeld was reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nAnother time, a young man, named Von der Sulhn, journeyed from Dresden\r\nto Paris; unless you are told, you could scarcely imagine for what\r\npurpose. There are people who travel for amusement, for business, for\r\na change of air, or merely to be able to say they have been at such\r\nand such a place. Some go abroad for instruction, others, perhaps,\r\nwith no other object in view than to eat frogs in Paris, bouillabaisse\r\nat Marseilles, a polenta at Milan, macaroni at Naples, an olla podrida\r\nin Spain, or conscoussou in Africa. Von der Sulhn travelled to\r\nassassinate the Emperor. Like Scævola and Brutus, he, no doubt,\r\nimagined the crime would hand down his name to posterity. In youth,\r\nall of us have erred in judgment more or less. Sulhn thought the\r\nEmperor ought to be slain. Unfortunately for him, the Duke of Rovigo,\r\nthe then minister of police, entertained a different opinion. He\r\nthought, in point of fact, that the Emperor ought not to be killed:\r\nhence it was that the young Saxon found himself in chains, and that\r\nthe Duke went to ask the Emperor what he should do with him. We ought,\r\nhowever, to mention that the young man, in his character of an\r\nenlightened German, testified his regret that he had not succeeded in\r\ncarrying out his project, and protested that, in the event of\r\nregaining his liberty, he would renew the attempt. \"Never mind,\" said\r\nthe Emperor to the duke, \"the young man's age is his excuse. Do not\r\nmake the affair public, for, if it is bruited about, I must punish the\r\nheadstrong youth, which I have no wish to do. I should be sorry to\r\nplunge a worthy family into grief by immolating such a scapegrace.\r\nSend him to Vincennes, give him some books to read, and write to his\r\nmother.\" In 1814, the young man obtained his liberty, his family, and\r\nhis Germany, and it is to be hoped that he afterwards became a\r\nrespectable pater-familias, a sort of Aulic councillor, and that,\r\nduring the troublesome times in the land of Sauerkraut, he was before,\r\nand not behind, the barricades of his darling patria. If he be dead,\r\nit is to be supposed that, instead of lying a headless trunk\r\nignominiously in a ditch, or in the unconsecrated cemetery of Clamort,\r\nhe is reposing entire in the paternal tomb.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of March, 1815, the Emperor landed at Cannes--he had\r\nreturned from the island of Elba. On the beach he was joined by one\r\nman, at Antibes by a company, at Digne by a battalion, at Gap by a\r\nregiment (that of Labedoyer), at Grenoble by an army. The hearts of\r\nthe soldiers of France went to him like steel to the loadstone--first\r\na drop, and then a torrent; the Empire, like a snowball, increased as\r\nit progressed. At Lyons, the Count of Artois, the setting sun, is\r\nobliged to go out of one gate the moment that Napoleon, the rising\r\nsun, comes in at another. Smiles, orations, triumphal arches, and even\r\nthe discourses that had been prepared to welcome the Bourbons, were\r\nused to congratulate their successor on his return. Cockades and flags\r\nwere altered to suit the occasion, by inserting a stripe of red here\r\nand another of blue there. One national guard, but only one, remained\r\nfaithful to the Bourbons; he would neither alter his cockade nor his\r\ncolors, and remained true to his patrons in the hour of disaster.\r\nEverybody asked, what would the Emperor do with him? Would he be\r\nimprisoned or banished? Neither; the Emperor sent him a cross of the\r\norder of merit! It is, no doubt, grand to have overthrown the\r\nbrilliant army of Murad Bey in Egypt; to have vanquished Melas,\r\nWurmser, and Davidowich in Italy; Bragation, Kutusoff, and Barclay de\r\nTolly in Russia; Mack in Germany; and thus to have reduced the entire\r\ncontinent of Europe to subjection. But it appears to us that a still\r\ngreater feat was the victory he gained over himself, when, in the\r\nmidst of the fever excited by his return, and the animosity of\r\nparties, he gave this cross to the solitary adherent of misfortune.\r\nHaving made these slight digressions into the future, it is proper\r\nthat we should return to our story.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious roads of Providence do not always lead to the places\r\nthey seem to go; it often happens that, when we expect to be swallowed\r\nup by the breakers that surround us, we are wafted into a harbor, and\r\nthat we encounter success where we only anticipated disappointment.\r\nThe rigorous enactments of the continental system, that the other day\r\nhad ruined the two brothers, became all at once the source of\r\nunlooked-for wealth; for, on account of the scarcity of colonial\r\nproduce, a scarcity dating from the prohibitory laws promulgated in\r\n1807, the merchandise of the young men had more than quadrupled in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nFrom the grade of hard-working mechanics they were suddenly promoted\r\nto the rank of wealthy merchants. They consequently abandoned the\r\nlaborious employments that for a month had enabled them to live, and\r\nto keep despair and misery at bay. Willis, greatly to his\r\ninconvenience, found himself transformed into a gentleman at large,\r\nwhich caused him to make some material alterations in the manipulation\r\nand quality of his pipes.\r\n\r\nFritz busied himself in collecting in, the by no means inconsiderable\r\nsums, which their property realised. He did not value the gold for its\r\nglitter or its sound, he valued it only as a means of enabling himself\r\nand his brother to return promptly to their ocean home. Jack undertook\r\nthe task of finding a scalpel to save his mother--doubtless a\r\ndifficult task; for how was he to induce a surgeon of standing to\r\nabandon his connexion, his family, and his fame, and to undertake a\r\nperilous voyage to the antipodes, for the purpose of performing an\r\noperation in a desert, where there were neither newspapers to proclaim\r\nit, academicians to discuss it, nor ribbons to reward it? As for the\r\ngentlemen of the dentist and barber school, like Drs. Sangrado and\r\nFontanarose of Figaro, the remedy was even worse by a great deal than\r\nthe disease. But, as we have said, Jack promised to find a surgeon,\r\nand the research was so arduous, that he was scarcely ever seen during\r\nthe day by either Willis or his brother.\r\n\r\nTo Willis was confided the office of chartering a ship for the\r\nhomeward voyage, and there were not a few obstacles to overcome in\r\norder to accomplish this. French ship-masters at that time engaged in\r\nvery little legitimate business; they embarked their capital in\r\nprivateering, prefering to capture the merchantmen of England to\r\nrisking their own. One morning, Willis started as usual in search of a\r\nship, but soon returned to the inn where they had established their\r\nhead-quarters in a state of bewilderment; he threw himself into a\r\nchair, and, before he could utter a word, had to fill his pipe and\r\nlight it.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I am completely and totally flabbergasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\" inquired the two brothers.\r\n\r\n\"You could not guess, for the life of you, what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, Willis, and would therefore prefer you to tell us at\r\nonce what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"After this,\" continued Willis, \"no one need tell me that there are no\r\nmiracles now-a-days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have stumbled upon a miracle, have you, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so. That they do not happen every day, I can admit;\r\nbut I have a proof that they do come about sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very probably, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion that Providence often leads us about by the hands,\r\njust as little children are taken to school, lest they should be\r\ntempted to play truant by the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unlikely, Willis; but the miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going along quietly, not thinking I was being led anywhere in\r\nparticular, when, all at once, I was hove up by--If a bullet had hit\r\nme right in the breast, I could not have been more staggered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever hove you up then, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was hove up by the sloop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sloop?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it taking a walk, Willis?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been to sea since we saw you last?\" asked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"If I had fallen in with the craft at sea, Master Fritz, I should not\r\nhave been half so much astonished. The sea is the natural element of\r\nships; we do not find gudgeons in corn fields, nor shoot hares on the\r\nocean. But it was on land that I hailed the _Nelson_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it going round the corner of a street that you stumbled upon it,\r\nWillis?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly; but to make a long story short--\"\r\n\r\n\"When you talk of cutting anything short, we are in for a yarn,\" said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\"And you are sure to interrupt him in the middle of it,\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in two words,\" said Willis, knocking the ashes out of his pipe,\r\n\"I was cruising about the shipyards, looking if there was a condemned\r\ncraft likely to suit us--some of them had gun-shot wounds in their\r\ntimbers, others had been slewed up by a shoal--and, to cut the matter\r\nshort--\"\r\n\r\n\"Another yarn,\" suggested Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I luffed up beside the hull of a cutter-looking craft that had been\r\ncompletely gutted. But, changed and dilapidated as that hull is, I\r\nrecognized it at once to be that of the _Nelson_. Now do you believe\r\nin miracles?\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you met Ernest or Frank in the street to-morrow, pale,\r\nmeagre, and in rags, would you recognize them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most assuredly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, by the same token, sailors can always recognize a ship they\r\nhave sailed in. They know the form of every plank and the line of\r\nevery bend. There are hundreds of marks that get spliced in the\r\nmemory, and are never forgotten. But in the present case there is no\r\nroom for any doubt, a portion of the figure head is still extant, and\r\nthe word _Nelson_ can be made out without spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did it get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, Master Fritz, it could not have told me, even if I had\r\ntaken the trouble to inquire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was determined, however, to find it out some other way, so I\r\nsteered for a café near the harbor, where the pilots and long-shore\r\ncaptains go to play at dominoes. I was in hopes of picking up some\r\nstray waif of information, and, sooth to say, I was not altogether\r\ndisappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another meeting, I'll be bound,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"My falling in with the _Nelson_ astonished you, did it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll bet my best pipe that this one will surprise you still\r\nmore. You recollect my comrade, Bill, _alias_ Bob, of the _Hoboken_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I met him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the man who had both his legs shot off, and died in consequence\r\nof his wounds?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"The same.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was afterwards thrown overboard with a twenty-four pound\r\nshot tied to his feet!\" exclaimed Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"The same.\"\r\n\r\nAt this astonishing assertion the young men regarded Willis with an\r\nair of apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"You think I am mad, no doubt, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever can we think, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit that my statement looks very like it at first sight, but\r\nstill you are wrong, as you will see by-and-by. I could scarcely\r\nbelieve my eyes when I saw him. 'Is that you, Bill Stubbs,' says I,\r\n'at last?'\r\n\r\n\"'Lor love ye!' says he, 'is that you, Pilot?'\r\n\r\n\"He then took hold of my hand, and gave it such a shake as almost\r\nwrenched it off.\r\n\r\n\"'Where in all the earth did you hail from?' he said. 'I thought you\r\nwere dead and gone?'\r\n\r\n\"'And I thought you were the same,' said I, 'and no mistake.'\r\n\r\n\"'Alive and hearty though, as you see, Pilot; only a little at sea\r\namongst the _mounseers_.'\r\n\r\n\"'But what about the _Hoboken_?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'What _Hoboken_?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'Were you not aboard a Yankee cruiser some months back?'\r\n\r\n\"'Never was aboard a Yankee in all my life,' says Bill.\r\n\r\n\"And no more he was, for he never left the _Nelson_ till she was high\r\nand dry in Havre dockyard; so, the short and the long of it is, that I\r\nmust have been wrong in that instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I should think,\" remarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Yet the resemblance was very remarkable; the only difference was a\r\ncarbuncle on the nose, which the real Bill has and the other has not,\r\nbut which I had forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Cicero,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Another Admiral?\" inquired Willis, drily.\r\n\r\n\"No, he was only an orator.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill soon satisfied me that he was the very identical William Stubbs,\r\nand that the other was only a very good imitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not receive you with a punch in the ribs, at all events, like\r\nthe apocryphal Bill,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No; but what is more to the purpose, he told me that, after having\r\nstruggled with the terrible tempest off New Switzerland--which you\r\nrecollect--the _Nelson_ found herself at such a distance, that Captain\r\nLittlestone resolved to proceed on his voyage, and to return again as\r\nspeedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\"'We arrived at the Cape all right,' added Bill, 'landed the New\r\nSwitzerland cargo, and sailed again with the Rev. Mr. Wolston on\r\nboard. A few days after leaving the Cape, we were pounced upon by a\r\nFrench frigate; the _Nelson_, with its crew, was sent off as a prize\r\nto Havre, and here I have been ever since,' said Bill, 'a prisoner at\r\nlarge, allowed to pick up a living as I can amongst the shipping.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And the remainder of the crew?\" inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Are all here prisoners of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Rev. Mr. Wolston and the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are prisoners on parole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! in Havre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, close at hand, in the Hotel d'Espagne.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we sitting here,\" cried Jack, snatching up his hat and rushing\r\ndown stairs four steps at a time.\r\n\r\nWillis and Fritz followed as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nWhen they all three reached the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"If Captain Littlestone is here, Willis,\" said Jack, \"he could not\r\nhave been on board the _Boudeuse_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, Master Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, Great Rono, you must have been dreaming in the\r\ncorvette as well as in the Yankee.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" insisted Willis, \"it was no dream, I am certain of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain the riddle, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do that just at present, but it may be cleared up by-and-by,\r\nlike all the mysteries and miracles that surround us.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] This circumstance is historical, and will be found at length in\r\nthe Memoirs of Napoleon, by Amédée Goubard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN LITTLESTONE IS FOUND, AND THE REV. MR. WOLSTON IS SEEN FOR THE\r\nFIRST TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nJack, on arriving at the hotel, ascertained the number of the room in\r\nwhich Captain Littlestone was located. In his hurry to see his old\r\nfriend, the young man did not stop to knock at the door, but entered\r\nwithout ceremony, with Fritz and Willis at his heels. They found\r\nthemselves in the presence of two gentlemen, one of whom sat with his\r\nface buried in his hands, the other was reading what appeared to be a\r\nsmall bible.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a young man seemingly of about twenty-four or\r\ntwenty-five years of age. He had a mild but noble bearing, and his\r\naspect denoted habitual meditation. His eyes were remarkably piercing\r\nand expressive; in short, he was one of those men at whom we are led\r\ninvoluntarily to cast a glance of respect, without very well knowing\r\nwhy; perhaps it might be owing to the gravity of his demeanour,\r\nperhaps to the peculiar decorum of his deportment, or perhaps to the\r\nscrupulous propriety of his dress. He raised his eyes from the book he\r\nheld in his hand, and gazed tranquilly at the three figures who had so\r\nabruptly interrupted his reveries.\r\n\r\n\"May I inquire,\" said he, \"to what we owe this intrusion on our\r\nprivacy, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to apologise for our rudeness,\" said Fritz; \"but are you not\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Wolston?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Charles Wolston, and I am a minister of the gospel, and\r\nmissionary of the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir,\" continued Fritz, \"I am the bearer of a message from your\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"From my father!\" exclaimed the missionary, starting up; \"you come\r\nthen from the Pacific Ocean?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere the second gentleman raised his head, and looked as if he had\r\njust awakened from a dream. He gazed at the speakers with a puzzled\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know me, captain?\" said Willis.\r\n\r\nLittlestone, for it was he, continued to gaze in mute astonishment, as\r\nif the events of the past had been defiling through his memory; and he\r\nprobably thought that the figures before him were mere phantom\r\ncreations of his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Willis! can it be possible?\" he exclaimed, taking at the same time\r\nthe Pilot's proffered hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain, as you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the two young Beckers, as I live!\" cried Littlestone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, \"and delighted to find you at last.\"\r\n\r\nLittlestone then shook them all heartily by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is but a poor welcome that I, a prisoner in the enemy's country,\r\ncan give you to Europe; still I am truly overjoyed to see you. But\r\nwhere have you all come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From New Switzerland,\" replied Jack.\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"By sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, of course; and I presume another ship anchored in Safety Bay?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, captain. Seeing you did not return to us, we embarked in the\r\npinnace and came in search of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your pinnace was but indifferently calculated to weather a gale,\r\nkeeping out of view the other dangers incidental to such a voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, captain; but my brother and I, with Willis for a pilot and\r\nProvidence for a guardian, ventured to brave these perils; and here we\r\nare, as you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your mother consented to such a dangerous proceeding, did she?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was for her, and yet against her will, that we embarked on the\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"For her, because, when we left, she was dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dying, say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and our object in coming to Europe was chiefly to obtain\r\nsurgical aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you found a surgeon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, but we are in hopes of finding one.\"\r\n\r\n\"If money is wanted, besides the value of the cargo I landed for you\r\nat the Cape, you may command my purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, captain, but the merchandise we have here is\r\nlikely to be sufficient for our purpose. Unfortunately, gold is not\r\nthe only thing that is requisite.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, a disinterested love of humanity is needful;\r\nthere are few men of science and skill who would not risk more than\r\nthey would gain by accepting any offer we can make. It is not easy to\r\nfind the heart of a son in the body of a physician.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, will you do, my poor friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my secret, captain.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, the missionary had put a thousand questions\r\nto Willis and Fritz relative to his father, mother, and sisters, and a\r\nsmile now and then lit up his features as Fritz related some of the\r\nfamily mishaps.\r\n\r\n\"You must have undergone some hardships in your voyage from the\r\nantipodes to Havre de Grace,\" said Littlestone to Jack,\r\n\"notwithstanding the skill of my friend the Pilot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain, a few,\" replied Jack. \"I myself made a narrow escape\r\nfrom being killed and eaten by a couple of savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Providence interfered at the critical moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so I should imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend the Pilot was more fortunate; he was abducted by the\r\nnatives of Hawaii; but, instead of converting him into mincemeat, they\r\ntransformed him into a divinity, bore him along in triumph to a\r\ntemple, where he was perfumed with incense, and had sacrifices offered\r\nup to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willis must have felt himself highly honored,\" said the captain,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"These fine things did not, however, last long, for next day they were\r\nwound up with a cloud of arrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"And another interposition of Providence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, none of the arrows were winged with death.\"\r\n\r\n\"After that,\" remarked Willis, \"we fell in with a Yankee cruiser, were\r\ntaken on board, and carried into the latitude of the Bahamas, where we\r\nfell in with Old Flyblow, who, after a tough set-to, sent the Yankee a\r\nprize to Bermuda, and took us on board as passengers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Jack, \"whilst we were under protection of the American\r\nflag, Willis fell in with a certain Bill Stubbs, who was shot in the\r\nfight and died of his wounds. This trifling accident did not, however,\r\nprevent Willis falling in with him alive in Havre.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still seem to delight in paradoxes, Master Jack,\" said the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"The English cruiser,\" continued Jack, \"was afterwards captured by a\r\nFrench corvette, on which it appears you were on board _incognito_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! I on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; ask Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were not, captain, how could you come to my cabin every night\r\nand ask me questions?\" inquired the latter.\r\n\r\nAt this point, a shade of anxiety crossed Littlestone's features; he\r\nturned and looked at the missionary--the missionary looked at\r\nFritz--Fritz stared at his brother--Jack gazed at Willis--and Willis,\r\nwith a puzzled air, regarded everybody in turn.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" continued Jack, \"after experiencing a variety of both good\r\nand bad fortune, sometimes vanquished and sometimes the victors, first\r\nwounded, then cured, we arrived here in Havre, where, for a time, we\r\nwere plunged into the deepest poverty; we were blacksmiths and\r\ncarpenters by turns, and thought ourselves fortunate when we had a\r\nchair to mend or a horse to shoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The workings of Providence,\" said the missionary, \"are very\r\nmysterious, and, perhaps, you will allow me to illustrate this fact by\r\ndrawing a comparison. A ship is at the mercy of the waves; it sways,\r\nlike a drunken man, sometimes one way and sometimes another. All on\r\nboard are in commotion, some are hurrying down the hatchways, and\r\nothers are hurrying up. The sailors are twisting the sails about in\r\nevery possible direction. Some of the men are closing up the\r\nport-holes, others are working at the pumps. The officers are issuing\r\na multiplicity of orders at once, the boatswain is constantly sounding\r\nhis whistle. There is no appearance of order, confusion seems to reign\r\ntriumphant, and there is every reason to believe that the commands are\r\nissued at random.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often wondered,\" said Jack, \"how so many directions issued on\r\nship board in a gale at one and the same moment could possibly be\r\nobeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us descend, however, to the captain's cabin,\" continued the\r\nmissionary. \"He is alone, collected, thoughtful, and tranquil, his eye\r\nfixed upon a chart. Now he observes the position of the sun, and marks\r\nthe meridian; then he examines the compass, and notes the polary\r\ndeviation. On all sides are sextants, quadrants, and chronometers. He\r\nquietly issues an order, which is echoed and repeated above, and thus\r\naugments the babel on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"A single order,\" remarked Willis, \"often gives rise to changes in\r\ntwenty different directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"On deck,\" continued the missionary, \"the crew appear completely\r\ndisorganized. In the captain's cabin, you find that all this apparent\r\nconfusion is the result of calculation, and is essential to the safety\r\nof the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said Jack, \"it is difficult to see how this result is\r\neffected by disorder.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; and, therefore, we must rely upon the skill of the captain; we\r\nbehold nothing but uproar, but we know that all is governed by the\r\nmost perfect discipline. So it is with the world; society is a ship,\r\nmen and their passions are the mast, sails, rigging, the anchors,\r\nquadrants, and sextants of Providence. We understand nothing of the\r\ncombined action of these instruments; we tremble at every shock, and\r\nfear that every whirlwind is destined to sweep us away. But let us\r\npenetrate into the chamber of the Great Ruler. He issues his commands\r\ntranquilly; we see that He is watching over our safety; and whatever\r\nhappens, our hearts beat with confidence, and our minds are at rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" added Littlestone, \"we are resigned to our fate as\r\nprisoners of war; but still we hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not without good reason,\" said Willis; \"for it will go hard with\r\nme if I do not realize your hopes, and that very shortly too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see very well how our hopes of liberty can be realized till\r\npeace is proclaimed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" exclaimed Willis. \"Yes, in another twenty years or so,\r\nperhaps; to wail for such an unlikely event will never do; my young\r\nfriend, Master Jack Becker, is in a hurry, and we must all leave this\r\nplace within a month at latest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean us, then, to make our escape, Willis; but that is\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea that it is not impossible, captain; the cargo Masters\r\nFritz and Jack have here will realize a large sum; the pearls,\r\nsaffron, and cochineal, are bringing their weight in gold. I shall be\r\nable to charter or buy a ship with the proceeds, and some dark night\r\nwe shall all embark; and if a surgeon is not willing to come of his\r\nown accord, I shall press the best one in the place: it won't be the\r\nfirst time I have done such a thing, with much less excuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"One will be willing,\" said Jack; \"so you need not introduce One-eyed\r\nDick's schooner here, Willis.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far so good, then; it only remains for us to smuggle the captain,\r\nthe missionary, and the crew of the _Nelson_ on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are prisoners,\" said Littlestone.\r\n\r\n\"I know that well enough; if you were not prisoners, of course there\r\nwould be no difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Recollect, Willis, we are not only prisoners, but we are on parole.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Willis, scratching his ear, \"I did not think of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The situation,\" remarked Jack, \"is something like that of Louis XIV.\r\nat the famous passage of the Rhine, of whom Boileau said: 'His\r\ngrandeur tied him to the banks.' Had you been only a common sailor,\r\ncaptain, a parole would not have stood in the way of your escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Willis, \"the parole can be given up, can it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not without a reasonable excuse,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Willis, \"you can go with the minister to the\r\nMaritime Prefect, and say: 'Sir, you know that everyone's country is\r\ndear to one's heart, and you will not be astonished to hear that\r\nmyself and friend have an ardent desire to return to ours. This desire\r\non our part is so great, that some day we may be tempted to fly, and,\r\nconsequently, forfeit our honor; for, after all, there are only a few\r\nmiles of sea between us and our homes. We ought not to trust to our\r\nstrength when we know we are weak. Do us, therefore, the favor to\r\nwithdraw our parole; we prefer to take up our abode in a prison, so\r\nthat, if we can escape, we may do so with our honor intact.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose this favor granted, we shall be securely shut up in a\r\ndungeon. I scarcely think that would alter our position for the\r\nbetter, or render our escape practicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will, at all events, be free to try, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a self-evident proposition, Willis, and, so far as that goes,\r\nI have no objection to adopt the alternative of prison fare. What say\r\nyou, minister?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for myself,\" replied the missionary, \"a little additional hardship\r\nmay do me good, for the Scriptures say: Suffering purifieth the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall, therefore, resign our paroles, Willis; but bear in mind\r\nthat it is much easier to get into prison than to get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave the getting out to me, captain; where there's a will there's\r\nalways a way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" whispered the captain to Fritz, \"that Willis is all\r\nright in his upper story?\"\r\n\r\nFritz shook his head, which, in the ordinary acceptation of the sign,\r\nmeans, I really do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nWILLIS PROVES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BE FREE IS TO GET SENT TO\r\nPRISON--AN ESCAPE--A DISCOVERY--PROMOTIONS--SOMNAMBULISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the events narrated in the foregoing chapter, the\r\nthrice-rescued produce of Oceania had been converted into the current\r\ncoin of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the proceeds was placed at the disposal of\r\nWillis, to facilitate him in procuring the means of returning to New\r\nSwitzerland. He--like connoisseurs who buy up seemingly worthless\r\npictures, because they have detected, or fancy they have detected,\r\nsome masterly touches rarely found on modern canvas--had bought, not a\r\nship, but the remains of what had once been one. This he obtained for\r\nalmost nothing, but he knew the value of his purchase. The carcass was\r\nrefitted under his own eye, and, when it left the ship-yard, looked as\r\nif it had been launched for the first time. The timbers were old; but\r\nthe cabins and all the internal fittings were new; a few sheets of\r\ncopper and the paint-brush accomplished the rest. When the mast was\r\nfitted in, and the new sails bent, the little sloop looked as jaunty\r\nas a nautilus, and, according to Willis himself, was the smartest\r\nlittle craft that ever hoisted a union-jack.\r\n\r\nWhether the captain and the missionary still entertained the belief\r\nthat the Pilot's wits had gone a wool-gathering or not, certain it is\r\nthat they had followed his instructions, in so far as to relinquish\r\ntheir parole, and thus to lose their personal liberty. They were both\r\nsecurely locked up in one of the rooms or cells of the old palace or\r\ncastle of Francois I., which was then, and perhaps is still, used as\r\nthe state prison of Havre de Grace. This fortalice chiefly consists of\r\na battlemented round tower, supported by strong bastions, and\r\npierced, here and there, by small windows, strongly barred. The foot\r\nof the tower is bathed by the sea, which, as Willis afterwards\r\nremarked, was not only a favor granted to the tower, but likewise an\r\nobligation conferred upon themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pilot's purchase had been completely refitted, stores\r\nshipped, papers obtained, and every requisite made for the outward\r\nvoyage, the departure of the three adventurers was announced, and a\r\ncrowd assembled on shore to see their ship leave the harbor. She was\r\ntowed out to the roads, where she lay tranquilly mirrored in the sea,\r\nready to start the moment her commander stepped on board. Neither\r\nFritz nor Jack, however, had yet completed their preparations. For the\r\nmoment, therefore, the vessel was left in charge of some French\r\nseamen, whom Willis, however, had taken care to engage only for a\r\nshort period.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about a week after this, Fritz and Jack, in a small boat,\r\npainted perfectly black and manned by four stout rowers, with muffled\r\noars, were lurking about the fortalice already mentioned. The night\r\nwas pitch dark, and there was no moon. The waves beat sullenly on the\r\nfoot of the tower and surged back upon themselves, like an enraged\r\nenemy making an abortive attempt to storm the walls of a town. Not a\r\nword was uttered, and the young men were intently listening, as if\r\nexpecting to hear some preconcerted signal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in one of the rooms or cells of the round tower, about\r\nsixty feet above the level of the sea, Captain Littlestone, the\r\nmissionary, and the Pilot were engaged in a whispered conversation,\r\nthrough which might be detected the dull sound of an oiled file\r\nworking against iron. The cell was ample in size, but the stone walls\r\nwere without covering of any kind. It was lighted during the day by\r\none of the apertures we have already described; the thickness of the\r\nwalls did not permit the rays of the sun to penetrate to the interior,\r\nand at the time of which we speak the apartment was perfectly dark.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see the warder,\" whispered Willis, \"when he comes,\r\nwith his bundle of keys and his night-cap in his hand, to wish your\r\nhonors good morning, but, in point of fact, to see whether your\r\nhonors are in safe custody. How astonished the old rascal will be! Ho,\r\nho, ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"My good fellow,\" said the missionary, \"it is scarcely time to laugh\r\nyet. It is just possible we may escape; but vain boasting is in no\r\ncase deserving of approbation. It is, indeed, scarcely consistent with\r\nthe dignity of my cloth to be engaged in breaking out of a prison;\r\nstill, I am a man of peace, and not a man of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Willis, \"you are not; but I wish to goodness you were a\r\nseventy-four--under the right colors, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to remark,\" continued the missionary, \"that I am a man of\r\npeace, and, consequently, do not think that I am justly entitled to be\r\ntreated as a prisoner of war. Under these circumstances, I am, no\r\ndoubt, justified in shaking off my bonds in any way that is open to\r\nme; the more particularly as the apostle Paul was once rescued from\r\nbondage in a similar way.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was let down from a window in a basket, was he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; whilst journeying in the city of Damascus, the governor, whose\r\nname was Avetas resolved to arrest him and accordingly placed sentries\r\nat all the gates. Paul, however was permitted to pass through a house,\r\nthe windows of which overhung the walls of the town, whence, as you\r\nsay, he was let down in a basket, and escaped.\"[J]\r\n\r\n\"I trust your reverence will be in much the same position as the\r\napostle, by-and-by--only you will have to dispense with the basket,\"\r\nsaid Willis.\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to remain in bondage longer than is absolutely\r\nnecessary,\" said the minister; \"but there still seem difficulties in\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Willis, plying the file with redoubled energy, \"this iron\r\ngives me more bother than I anticipated; but it is the nature of iron\r\nto be hard; however, it will not be long before we are all out of\r\nbondage, as your reverence calls it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May not the warder discover our escape, and raise an alarm in time\r\nto retake us?\" inquired the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not,\" replied the captain; \"thanks to our habit of\r\nsleeping with our faces to the wall, he will be deceived by the\r\ndummies we have placed in the beds, for he always approaches on\r\ntip-toe not to awake us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be for the first round; but the second will assuredly\r\ndisclose our absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" remarked Willis; \"he will then go right up to the beds,\r\nand shake the dummies by the shoulders, and say, Does your honor not\r\nknow that it is ten o'clock, and that your breakfast is cooling? The\r\ndummies will, of course, not condescend to reply, and then--but what\r\nmatters? By that time we shall have shaken out our top-sail, and\r\npursuit will be out of the question. I should like to see the craft\r\nthat will overtake us when once we are a couple of miles ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor man!\" said the missionary, sighing; \"our escape may, perhaps,\r\ncost him his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" said Willis; \"perhaps, at first, he will make an\r\nattempt to tear his hair, but, as he wears a wig, that will not do\r\nmuch mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall, however, leave my purse on the table,\" said the missionary;\r\n\"as it is tolerably well filled, that may afford the poor fellow some\r\nconsolation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I shall do the same,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"If that does not console him for being deprived of the pleasure of\r\nour society, I do not know what will,\" observed Willis.\r\n\r\n\"It is now two o'clock,\" said the captain, feeling his watch, \"and the\r\nwarder goes his first rounds at three; we have therefore just one hour\r\nfor our preparations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have severed one bar,\" said Willis, \"and the other is nearly\r\nthrough at one end, so keep your minds perfectly at ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your patience and equanimity, Willis, does you infinite credit,\" said\r\nthe missionary. \"Minister of the Gospel though I be, I fear that I do\r\nnot possess these qualities to the same extent, for, to confess the\r\ntruth, I feel an inward yearning to be free, and yet am restless and\r\nanxious.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no great use in being in a hurry,\" said the Pilot; \"the\r\nmore haste the less speed, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but might not these bars have been sawn through before? If this\r\nhad been done, our flight would have been, at least, less\r\nprecipitate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, Mr. Wolston,\" said the captain, \"that we did not know\r\ntill nine o'clock the affair was to come off to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I could not come any sooner to tell you,\" remarked the Pilot; \"I\r\nhad the greatest difficulty in the world to get in here; the maritime\r\ncommissary would not take me into custody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to ask you how you contrived to get incarcerated,\" observed\r\nthe captain; \"you were not a prisoner, and could not plead your\r\nparole.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; and consequently I had to plead something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willis,\" said the missionary, \"the work you are engaged in must be\r\nvery fatiguing, let me exercise my strength upon the bars for a short\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like, minister, but keep the file well oiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, motive, then, did you urge, Willis?\" inquired Captain\r\nLittlestone.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Commissary,' said I, 'one of your frigates captured the English\r\ncutter _Nelson_ some time ago, but the capture was not complete.'\r\n\r\n\"'How so?' inquired the commissary.\r\n\r\n\"'Because, Mr. Commissary,' said I, 'you did not capture the\r\nboatswain, and a British ship without a boatswain is no good; it is\r\nlike a body without a soul.'\r\n\r\n\"'Is that all you have to tell me?' said the commissary, looking glum.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said I, 'to make the capture complete, you have still to arrest\r\nthe boatswain, and here he is standing before you--I am the man; but\r\nhaving been detained by family affairs in the Pacific Ocean, I could\r\nnot surrender myself any sooner.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what do you want me to do with you?' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, what you would have done with me had I been on board the\r\n_Nelson_, to be sure.'\r\n\r\n\"'What! take you prisoner?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, commissary.'\r\n\r\n\"'You wish me to do so?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, certainly,'\r\n\r\n\"'Is it possible?'\r\n\r\n\"'Then you refuse to take me into custody, Mr. Commissary?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, positively,' said he; 'we take prisoners, but we do not accept\r\nthem when offered.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then you will not allow me to join my captain in his adversity?'\r\n\r\n\"'Your captain is as great a fool as yourself,' said he; 'he need not\r\nhave gone to prison unless he liked.'\r\n\r\n\"'That was a matter of taste on his part, Mr. Commissary, but is a\r\nmatter of duty on mine,'\"\r\n\r\n\"This bar is nearly through,\" whispered the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"There is no time to be lost,\" said the captain; \"the warder will be\r\nround in a quarter of an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Willis, \"the commissary began to get angry, he rose\r\nup, and was about to leave the room, when I placed myself resolutely\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' said I, 'one word more--you know the French laws; be good\r\nenough to tell me what crime will most surely and most promptly send\r\nme to prison.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, there are plenty of them,' said he, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, commissary,' says I, 'suppose I knock you down here on the\r\nspot, will that do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that not going a little too far, Willis?\"\r\n\r\n\"What could I do? The ship was all ready, everybody on board but\r\nyourselves, circumstances were pressing, and you know I would have\r\nfloored him as gently as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bar yielded. To the end of a piece of twine, which\r\nWillis had rolled round his body, a piece of stone was attached; this\r\nhe let down till it touched the water, and then the caw of a crow rang\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\n\"That was a very good imitation, Willis,\" said the captain. \"You did\r\nnot break any of the commissary's bones, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the threat was quite sufficient; he would not yield to my\r\nprayers, but he yielded to my impudence, and ordered me into custody.\r\nAt first, however, I was thrust into an underground cell; but I\r\nobtained, or rather my louis obtained for me, permission to chum with\r\nyou; and, by the way, what a frightful staircase I had to mount! that\r\nmore than any thing else, obliges us to get down by the window.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWillis, who continued to hold one end of the cord, at the sound of a\r\nwhistle drew it up, and found attached to the other end a stout rope\r\nladder. This he made fast to the bars of the window that still\r\nremained intact. At the request of the minister, all three then fell\r\nupon their knees and uttered a short prayer. Immediately after,\r\nWolston went out of the window and began to descend, the captain\r\nfollowed, and Willis brought up the rear. All three were cautiously\r\nprogressing downwards, when the missionary called out he had forgotten\r\nto _forget_ his purse.\r\n\r\n\"I have made the same omission,\" said the captain; \"hand yours up,\r\nWolston.\"\r\n\r\nThe missionary accordingly held up his with one hand whilst he held on\r\nthe ladder with the other. The captain bent down to take it, but found\r\nhe could not reach it without endangering his equilibrium. They both\r\nmade some desperate efforts to accomplish the feat, but the thing was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\"I see no help for it,\" said the missionary, \"but to ascend all three\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is awkward,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Willis, \"three o'clock is striking on the prison\r\nclock; the warder will be round in two minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"God sometimes permits good actions to go _unrewarded_,\" said the\r\nmissionary; \"but he never _punishes_ them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us re-ascend, then,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Willis, going upwards.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely time to re-enter the cell before they heard the\r\nsound of steps and the clank of keys in the corridor. The steps\r\ndiscontinued at their door, and a key was thrust into the lock.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" cried the captain from his bed, as the gaoler\r\nthrust his head inside the door.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said the warder, \"I heard a noise, and thought that your honor\r\nmight be ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your attention, Ambroise,\" replied the captain, in a\r\nhalf sleepy tone; \"but you have been deceived, we are all quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely so,\" added the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"All right old fellow!\" cried Willis, with a yawn.\r\n\r\nThis triple affirmation, which assured him, not only of the health,\r\nbut also of the custody of his prisoners, seemed satisfactory to the\r\ngaoler.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to have awoke your honors,\" said he, as he withdrew his\r\nhead and relocked the door; \"it must have been in the room overhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good?\" said Willis, \"the old rascal expects nothing.\"\r\n\r\nTwo well-lined purses were laid on the table, and in a few minutes\r\nmore the three men resumed their position on the ladder in the same\r\norder as before. They arrived safely in the boat, where they were\r\ncordially welcomed by Fritz and Jack. The men were then ordered to\r\npull for their lives to the ship, which they did with a hearty will.\r\nThe instant they stepped on board the anchor was weighed, and when\r\nmorning broke not a vestige of the old tower of Havre de Grace was\r\nanywhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed the captain, looking about him with an air of\r\nastonishment, \"this is my own vessel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain,\" said Willis, touching his cap, \"and I am its boatswain\r\nor pilot, whichever your honor chooses to call me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you obtain possession of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"By right of purchase she belongs to our friends, Masters Fritz and\r\nJack, but they have agreed to waive their claim, providing you proceed\r\nwith them to New Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree most willingly to these conditions,\" said Captain\r\nLittlestone, addressing the two brothers, \"the more so that my\r\ndestination was Sydney when the _Nelson_ was captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, captain,\" said Fritz, \"my brother and I have to\r\nrequest that you will resume the command, and treat us as passengers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my friends, thank you. Willis, are all the old crew on\r\nboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that were in Havre, your honor; I commissioned Bill Stubbs to\r\npick them up, and he managed to smuggle them all on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then pipe all hands on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, captain,\" said Willis, sounding his whistle.\r\n\r\nWhen the men were mustered, Littlestone made a short speech to them,\r\ntold them that they would receive pay for the time they had been in\r\nthe enemy's power, and inquired whether they were all willing to\r\ncontinue the voyage under his command. This question was responded to\r\nby a general assent.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he continued, turning to Willis, \"the share you have had in\r\nthe rescue of the _Nelson_ and its crew, conjointly with my interest\r\nat the Admiralty, will, I have not the slightest doubt, obtain for you\r\nthe well-merited rank of lieutenant of his Majesty's navy. I have,\r\ntherefore, to request that you will assume that position on board\r\nduring the voyage, until confirmed by the arrival of your commission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank your honor,\" said Willis, bowing.\r\n\r\n\"And now, lieutenant, you will be kind enough to rate William Stubbs\r\non the books as boatswain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, captain,\" said Willis, handing his whistle to Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Pipe to breakfast,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied the new boatswain, sounding the whistle.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Littlestone, turning to Jack, \"I do not see the\r\nsurgeon you spoke of on board. How is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is on board for all that,\" said Jack, drawing an official looking\r\ndocument out of his pocket; \"be kind enough to read that.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain accordingly read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Havre, 15th October, 1812._\r\n\r\n    \"This is to certify that Mr. Jack Becker has, for some time, been\r\n    a student in the hospitals of this town, and that he has\r\n    successfully passed through a stringent examination as to his\r\n    acquaintance with the diagnosis and cure of various diseases; as\r\n    also as to his knowledge of the practice of physic and surgery\r\n    generally.\r\n\r\n    \"He has specially directed his attention to the treatment of\r\n    cancer, and has performed several operations for the eradication\r\n    of that malady to the satisfaction of the surgeon in chief and my\r\n    own.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"GARAY DE NEVRES, M.D., Inspector of the Hospitals\".\r\n\r\nThis document was countersigned, sealed, and stamped by the mayor, the\r\nprefect, and other authorities of the department.\r\n\r\n\"How have you contrived to obtain so satisfactory a certificate in so\r\nshort a period?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I was introduced to the chief surgeon by the medical man on board the\r\n_Boudeuse_. I stated my position to him, and, probably, he threw\r\nfacilities in my way of obtaining the object I had in view that were,\r\nperhaps, rarely accorded to others. All the cases of cancer, for\r\nexample, were placed under my care; I had, therefore, an opportunity\r\nof observing a great many phases and varieties of that disease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you determined to follow up the profession of surgery, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain; I have shipped a medicine chest on board, a complete\r\nassortment of instruments, and a collection of English, French, and\r\nGerman medical works. It is my intention to make myself thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the theory of the science, and trust to chance for\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then allow me, Mr. Becker, to rate you as surgeon of the _Nelson_ for\r\nthe outward voyage. Will you accept the office?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure, Captain; but, at the same time, I trust there will be\r\nno occasion to exercise my skill.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one can say what may happen; disease turns up where it is least\r\nexpected. Lieutenant,\" he added, turning to Willis, \"be kind enough to\r\nrate Mr. Becker on the ship's books as surgeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, Aye, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the _Nelson_ was making her way rapidly along the French\r\ncoast, and had already crossed the Bay of Biscay. The _Nelson_ behaved\r\nherself admirably, and took to her new gear with excellent grace. All\r\nwas going merrily as a marriage bell. They did not now run very much\r\nrisk of cruisers, as Fritz had French papers perfectly _en regle_, and\r\nCaptain Littlestone would have had little difficulty to prove his\r\nidentity; besides, the speed of the _Nelson_ was sufficient to secure\r\ntheir safety in cases where danger was to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nOne night, about four bells (ten o'clock), when Willis was lazily\r\nlolling in his hammock, doubtless ruminating on his newly-acquired\r\ndignity, his cabin-door gradually opened, and the captain entered.\r\nWillis stared at first, thinking he might have something important to\r\ncommunicate, but he only muttered something about a cloud gathering in\r\nthe west. This was too much for Willis; it resembled his former\r\nmeditations so vividly, that he leaped out of his hammock, seized\r\nLittlestone by the collar, and called loudly for Fritz and Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It is not very respectfull, captain, to handle you in this way; but\r\nthe case is urgent, and I should like to have the mystery cleared up.\"\r\n\r\nThe two brothers, when they entered the cabin, beheld Willis holding\r\nthe captain tightly in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I have caught him at last, you see,\" said the Pilot.\r\n\r\n\"So it would appear,\" observed Jack; \"but are you not aware the\r\ncaptain is asleep?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was Littlestone had walked from his own cabin to that of\r\nWillis in a state of somnambulism.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired the latter, when he became conscious of\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is the matter, captain,\" replied Jack, \"only you have been\r\nwalking in your sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--yes--it must be so!\" exclaimed Littlestone; gazing about him with\r\na troubled air. \"Have I not paid you a visit of this kind before,\r\nWillis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"On board the _Boudeuse_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must have been the craft I was transferred to, then, after the\r\ncapture of the _Nelson_. Just call Mr. Wolston, and let us have the\r\nmatter explained.\"\r\n\r\nOn comparing notes, it appeared that the captain and the missionary\r\nhad been on board the _Boudeuse_. Both had been ill, and both had been\r\nclosely confined to their cabin during the entire voyage, partly on\r\naccount of their being prisoners of war, and partly on account of\r\ntheir illness. On one occasion, but on one only, the captain had\r\nescaped from his cabin during the night. Willis might, therefore, have\r\nseen him once, but that he had seen him oftener was only a dream.\r\n\r\n\"It appears, then,\" said Littlestone, \"that my illness has left this\r\nunfortunate tendency to sleep-walking. I shall, therefore, place\r\nmyself in your hands, Master Jack; perhaps you may be able to chase it\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best, captain; and I think I may venture to promise a\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\nWillis was sorry for the captain's sleeplessness, but he was glad that\r\nthe mystery hanging over them both had been so far cleared up. His\r\nvisions and dreams had been a source of constant annoyance to him; but\r\nnow that their origin had been discovered, he felt that henceforward\r\nhe might sleep in peace.\r\n\r\nAfter a rapid run, the sloop cast anchor off the Cape. Here Captain\r\nLittlestone reported himself to the commander on the station, and\r\nreceived fresh papers. He also sent off a despatch to the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, in which he reported the capture and rescue of his ship. He\r\ninformed them that his own escape and that of the crew was entirely\r\nowing to the tact and daring of Willis, the boatswain, whom, in\r\nconsequence, he had nominated his second in command, _vice_ Lieutenant\r\nDunsford, deceased; the appointment subject, of course, to their\r\nlordship's approval.\r\n\r\nWillis wrote a long letter to his wife, informing her of his expected\r\npromotion, adding that, in a year or so after the receipt of his\r\ncommission, he should retire on half-pay, and then emigrate to a\r\ndelightful country, where he had been promised a vast estate. He said\r\nthat, probably, he should have an entire island to himself, and\r\npossibly have the command of the fleet; but he thought it as well to\r\nsay nothing about tigers, sharks, and chimpanzees.\r\n\r\nThe missionary also wrote to England, relinquishing his charge in\r\nSouth Africa, and requesting a mission amongst the benighted\r\ninhabitants of the Pacific Ocean, where he stated he was desirous of\r\nsettling for family reasons, and where besides, he said, he would have\r\na wider and equally interesting field for his labors.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers found at the Cape a large sum of money at their\r\ndisposal; this, however, they had now no immediate use for; they,\r\nconsequently, left it to await the arrival of Frank and Ernest, who,\r\nin all probability, would return with the _Nelson_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements made, the _Nelson_ was fully armed and manned, an\r\nample supply of stores and ammunition was shipped, the mails in Sydney\r\nwere taken on board, and the sloop resumed her voyage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[J] 2nd Cor., xi., 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThree months after leaving the Cape, the coast of New Switzerland was\r\ntelegraphed from the mast head by Bill Stubbs. A gun was immediately\r\nfired, and towards evening the _Nelson_ entered Safety Bay. Fritz,\r\nJack, Captain Littlestone, the missionary, and Willis, were all\r\nstanding on deck, eagerly scanning the shore.\r\n\r\n\"There is father!\" cried Jack, \"armed with a telescope; and now I see\r\nFrank and Mrs. Wolston.\"\r\n\r\n\"There comes Mr. Wolston and Master Ernest,\" cried Willis, \"as usual,\r\na little behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I see nothing of my mother and the young ladies!\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Very odd,\" said Captain Littlestone, sweeping the horizon with his\r\nglass \"I can see nothing of them either.\"\r\n\r\nA horrible apprehension here glided into the hearts of the young men.\r\nThey knew well that, had their mother been able, she would have been\r\nthe first to welcome them home. Perhaps, under the inspiration of\r\ndespair, their lips were opening to deny the mercy of that Providence\r\nwhich had hitherto so remarkably befriended them, when at a great\r\ndistance, and scarcely perceptible to the naked eye, they descried\r\nthree figures advancing slowly towards the shore.\r\n\r\nOne of these forms was Mrs. Becker, who was leaning upon the arms of\r\nMary and Sophia Wolston.\r\n\r\n\"God be thanked, we are still in time,\" cried Fritz and Jack.\r\n\r\nA loud cheer, led by Willis, then rent the air. Half an hour after,\r\nthe two young men leaped on shore; they did not stay to shake hands\r\nwith their father and brothers, but ran on to where their mother\r\nstood. It was a long time before they could utter a syllable; the\r\ngreeting of the mother and her children was too affectionate to be\r\nexpressed in words.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, preparations for a serious operation were\r\nmade in Mrs. Becker's room. The entire colony was in a state of\r\nintense excitement, and an air of anxiety was imprinted on every\r\ncountenance. In the room itself the wing of a fly could have been\r\nheard, so breathless was the silence that prevailed. The patient's\r\neyes had been bandaged, under pretext of concealing from her sight the\r\nsurgical instruments and preparations for the operation. The real\r\ndesign, however, was to hide the operator, whom Mrs. Becker supposed\r\nto be an expert practitioner from Europe; for it was not thought\r\nadvisable that a mother's anxieties should be superadded to the\r\npatient's sufferings.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of trial the few persons present had sunk on their\r\nknees; Jack alone remained standing at the bedside of his mother. The\r\nJack of the past had entirely disappeared; he was somewhat pale, very\r\ngrave, but collected, firm, and resolute. It was, perhaps, the first\r\ninstance on record of a son being called upon to lacerate the body of\r\nhis mother. But the moment that God imposed such a task upon one of\r\nHis creatures, it is God himself that becomes the operator.\r\n\r\nWhen, some days after, Mrs. Becker--calm, radiant, and\r\nsaved--requested to see and thank her deliverer, it was Jack who\r\npresented himself. If she had known this sooner, it would, most\r\nundoubtedly, have augmented her terror, and increased the fever. As it\r\nwas, it redoubled her thankfulness, and hastened her recovery.\r\n\r\nFrank and Ernest embarked on board the _Nelson_ when she returned to\r\nNew Switzerland on her way to Europe. Two years afterwards, the former\r\nreturned in the capacity of a minister of the Church of England,\r\nbringing with him a sufficient number of men, women, and children to\r\nfurnish a respectable congregation; and it was rumored, though with\r\nwhat degree of truth I will not venture to say, that one of the young\r\nlady passengers in the ship was his destined bride. Ernest remained\r\nsome years in Europe, partly to consolidate relations between the\r\ncolony and the mother country, and partly with a view to realize his\r\npet project of establishing an observatory in New Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWillis, instead of being suspended at the yard-arm as he had insisted\r\non prognosticating, received his lieutenancy in due course,\r\naccompanied by a highly flattering letter from the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, thanking him, in the name of the captain and crew of the\r\n_Nelson_, for his exertions in their behalf. As soon, however, as\r\npeace was proclaimed, he retired on half-pay, and, with his wife and\r\ndaughter, emigrated to Oceania. He assumed his old post of admiral on\r\nShark's Island, where a commodious house had been erected. We must\r\npremise, at the same time, that to his honorary duties as admiral,\r\nconjoined the humbler, but not less useful, offices of lighthouse\r\nkeeper, manager of the fisheries, and harbor-master.\r\n\r\nAs a country grows rich, and advances in prosperity, it rarely, if\r\never, happens that the sum of human life becomes happier or better. It\r\nis, therefore, not without regret we learn that gold has been\r\ndiscovered in a land so highly favored by nature in other respects;\r\nfor, if such be the case, then adieu to the peace and tranquillity its\r\ninhabitants have hitherto enjoyed. The colony will soon be overrun\r\nwith Chinamen, American adventurers, and ticket-of-leave convicts.\r\nFarewell to the kindliness and hospitality of the community, for they\r\nwill inevitably be deluged with the refuse of the old, and also, alas!\r\nof the new world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
