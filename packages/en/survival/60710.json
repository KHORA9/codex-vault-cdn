This study explains why certain types of rocks and minerals occur\r\nat one place and not another, why the forms of the land differ from one\r\nregion to another, and why particular animal and plant remains are\r\nsometimes preserved as fossils in certain kinds of rocks. The\r\nprofessional geologist makes these studies his business; the amateur\r\nfinds these studies a fascinating hobby; but the uninitiated person\r\nmisses much of the pleasure of travel. Anyone who notices the difference\r\nbetween rocks or terrains and wonders “why?”, has a potential for\r\ngeology. Many fall into this class and it is for them that this booklet\r\nhas been written. It is hoped that with its aid, the traveler or\r\nvacationer may come to know something about the geology of Groton State\r\nForest. The author is confident that those who come into the habit of\r\nobserving nature and the world around them will find more meaning in\r\nlife itself. In any case, those traveling with children may find answers\r\nto some of their questions about minerals, rocks and mountains.\r\n\r\nGroton State Forest is not a geologist’s paradise—as compared to\r\nYellowstone Park or the Grand Canyon—but it does contain interesting\r\nrocks and land forms which can be explained geologically. In keeping\r\nwith the calm, subdued and mature atmosphere of the Vermont countryside,\r\nthe geology is unobtrusive. There are few jutting cliffs or bare rock\r\nexposures; all is mantled with vegetation. If this vegetation could be\r\nstripped away—admittedly, a postulation that would destroy the\r\nwilderness and charm that belongs to Groton—boulders and gravelly\r\nglacial deposits would be seen to fill the valleys. If in turn these\r\nboulders and the soil could be stripped away, a continuous floor of rock\r\nwould be exposed. This would be a geologist’s paradise—square miles of\r\nbare rock would be available for study. However, lacking the magic wand\r\nto perform this feat, we must be satisfied to glean what information we\r\ncan from the existing rock exposures.\r\n\r\nTo use a pun, it can be said that almost all the rocks found at Groton\r\nState Forest can be taken for granite. As well as has been determined,\r\nall the underlying rock is _granite_[1] and most of the boulders\r\ndeposited by glaciers of the last ice age are the same type of granite.\r\nTo avoid confusion in describing these rocks, the discussion has been\r\ndivided into two parts: the first deals with the granite of the bedrock,\r\nand the second deals with the glaciation of the area and the deposits\r\nresulting from it. A third section describes the geology in some of the\r\nnearby areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GRANITE AND RELATED ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of the granite_\r\n\r\nLedges of light-colored granite occur at the summits of most of the\r\nmountains and hills in the State Forest area and are found occasionally\r\nat lower elevations. They are conspicuous on Owlshead, Silver Ledge,\r\nLittle Deer, Big Deer, Niggerhead and Spicer Mountains; smaller ledges\r\nalso occur on Kettle, and Little Spruce mountains, Hardwood Ridge and\r\nthe low hills east of Groton Pond. At lower elevations, granite is found\r\nat the outlet of Groton Pond, along the railroad tracks west of Groton\r\nPond and at Stillwater Brook, along Osmore brook and at several other\r\nminor locations. These locations are shown diagrammatically on the map\r\nby a black dot. These dots indicate where the granite occurs but nothing\r\nabout the extent of the exposure. If every location of exposed rock were\r\nmarked with a dot, certain parts of the map, for instance, the west side\r\nof Niggerhead, would be solid black and the contour lines which show the\r\nelevation would be obscured completely.\r\n\r\nAll these rocks are presumably part of one large mass of granite which\r\nextends deep below the surface of the earth. Most of this body of\r\ngranite is hidden by the soil and bouldery glacial deposits, so that its\r\nexact areal extent is not known. It appears likely that it extends to\r\nthe southwest to the vicinity of East Barre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of the granite_\r\n\r\nThe granite found at Groton State Forest is a gray to white,\r\nmedium-grained rock with the mineral grains all about the same size.\r\nSurfaces exposed to weathering are generally darker in color and\r\nfrequently are covered with scales of dark colored lichen. If the rock\r\nis broken to reveal an unaltered surface close examination will disclose\r\nindividual mineral grains of mica, feldspar and quartz. _Mica_ occurs as\r\nvery small plates which appear either white or colorless, called\r\n_muscovite_, or as black shiny plates called _biotite_. The _feldspar_,\r\nwhich is the most abundant mineral in the granite, has a chalky white\r\nappearance and may occur as tabular grains which reflect light from\r\ntheir flat surfaces when held in the proper position. _Quartz_, which\r\ncontains only silicon and oxygen, the two most common elements in the\r\nearth’s crust, is a transparent, glassy mineral which has no flat\r\nsurfaces. It may appear gray because one can look down into the glassy\r\nmineral where there is no light source.\r\n\r\nA specimen of granite from Owlshead was studied with a microscope after\r\nit had been cut and ground to a thickness of only 0.03 millimeters. Many\r\nminerals, which ordinarily appear to be opaque, are transparent when\r\nground this thin. By their various optical properties, the different\r\nminerals can be identified and the composition of the rock can be\r\ndetermined. Figure 1 shows a photograph, taken through a microscope, of\r\none of these thin sections of granite. By careful examination of the\r\nthin section and by measuring the areal extent of the different minerals\r\npresent, the rock was determined to contain, by volume, 35 percent\r\nquartz, 60 percent feldspar (in proportions of 25 percent _microcline_\r\nfeldspar, KAlSi₃O₈ and 35 percent _plagioclase_ feldspar, NaAlSi₃O₈) and\r\n5 percent mica (in proportions of 4 percent biotite and 1 percent\r\nmuscovite). Although it is a member of the granite family, this rock\r\nshould, in strict terminology, be called a quartz monzonite rather than\r\na granite to indicate more precisely the mineral composition. Because of\r\nslight differences in composition, granite from the same body may\r\nelsewhere be correctly called granodiorite, quartz diorite or granite\r\nproper, depending on the relative amounts of the two feldspars and\r\nquartz. In this report these close distinctions have not been made and\r\nthe rock is simply called granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cracks in the granite_\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of natural breaks, or cracks, occur in the granite in the\r\nState Forest area. _Joints_ are breaks which occur along plane surfaces\r\nand _exfoliation_ is the name given to the breakage along curved\r\nsurfaces related to the exposure of the rock. Granite, as contrasted\r\nwith other rocks, is characterized by its uniformity of texture and\r\nmassiveness, so that any cracks present are conspicuous.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Photomicrograph of a thin section of\r\n    granite from Owlshead Mountain. The mineral with the grid pattern\r\n    (upper left) is a feldspar named microcline which has the\r\n    composition of KAlSi₃O₈. The one with the indistinct striped pattern\r\n    (lower center) is a feldspar named plagioclase, variety oligoclase,\r\n    which has the composition of approximately NaAlSi₃O₈. The patterns\r\n    for these minerals result from different portions of the same\r\n    mineral grain having different orientations, called twinning, so as\r\n    to give a different optical appearance. The clear white mineral\r\n    (right center) is quartz. The dark gray mineral with the fine lines\r\n    (upper center) is biotite and the smaller, lighter-colored, elongate\r\n    mineral to the right of the biotite is muscovite. The other minerals\r\n    are feldspar and quartz in different orientations. The actual\r\n    diameter of the clear white quartz grain (right center) is about\r\n    four-tenths of a millimeter so that the photograph is a\r\n    magnification of about one hundred.]\r\n\r\nJoints are more conspicuous of the two types, and typically belong to a\r\ngeneral system so that at a given location they tend to be parallel. On\r\ntop of Owlshead, for example, the most prominent joints trend N.25°W.\r\n(read: North twenty-five degrees to the west) with dips[2] that are\r\nvertical or dipping steeply to the southwest. Another set of joints\r\ntrends N.10°E. with dips that are vertical or dipping steeply to the\r\nsouthwest. Joints represent the breakage of the rock due to stress and\r\nstrain. Some joints result from tensional forces set up within the rock\r\nitself by contraction due to cooling of the originally hot solidified\r\nrock. Other joints result from larger-scale forces within the earth’s\r\ncrust which cause earthquakes and general movement of land masses. An\r\nexhaustive study of all the rocks in a large area would be required to\r\ndetermine conclusively the origin of the joints on Owlshead.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nearly vertical joints, a third set of nearly\r\nhorizontal joints may be observed on cliffs. These joints are called\r\n_sheeting_ and apparently are related to the depth from a former\r\ntopographic surface which existed at the time the sheeting originated.\r\nThe vertical joints and sheeting are important qualities of a rock to be\r\nconsidered in choosing a rock for commercial quarrying. Not only do\r\nthese factors effect the ease of quarrying, but they also determine the\r\namount of waste material which would have to be removed and discarded\r\nbecause of poor size and shape.\r\n\r\nExfoliation is the term for breakage due to the disintegration caused by\r\ndecomposition of the rock on surfaces exposed to the weather. It is\r\ncharacterized by the scaling off of concentric shells of altered rock to\r\nproduce a convex surface. Rocks showing exfoliation surfaces are not\r\ncommon at Groton. One of the best developed exfoliation surfaces,\r\nillustrated in Figure 2, occurs at the base of the cliffs on the south\r\nside of Owlshead Mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce joints have formed, they are enlarged by weathering. In particular,\r\nrocks are pushed apart by a “frost wedging.” When water freezes it\r\nexpands by about one-tenth of its volume. If it is confined it may exert\r\na pressure of as much as 138 tons per square foot. In this manner, huge\r\nblocks may be pushed apart. If they are at the edge of a cliff, or part\r\nof the cliff itself, they may eventually break off and fall to the slope\r\nbelow. The accumulation of broken rock at the base of a cliff is called\r\n_talus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin and age of the granite_\r\n\r\nThe granite originated in the interior of the earth many million years\r\nago as a molten mass, called _magma_. This magma moved upward through\r\nthe earth’s crust by a process of melting the pre-existing rock or by\r\nforcefully pushing it aside. When it reached its present position it\r\nbecame cooler and minerals began to crystallize out. However, as is\r\nshown in Figure 3, it is important to understand that the surface of the\r\nland was not in its present position and that the magma actually cooled\r\nbeneath a considerable thickness of other rocks. These overlying rocks,\r\nnow gone, acted as an insulator and prevented the magma from cooling too\r\nquickly. If the magma had risen through these rocks and reached their\r\nupper surface, it would have formed a lava flow similar to those of\r\npresent-day volcanoes and would have cooled much more rapidly. Rocks\r\nformed near the surface are characterized either by being fine-grained\r\nwithout visible crystals or by having a few large crystals in a\r\nfine-grained matrix; they never have a uniformly,\r\nmedium-to-coarse-grained texture. Thus, the texture of the granite at\r\nGroton State Forest proves that it cooled slowly and indicates that, at\r\nthe time of cooling, the granite was not at the surface. This is a\r\nreasonable postulation because studies of the regional geology indicate\r\nthat a large amount of rock has been removed from this area by erosion\r\nthrough the long periods of geologic time.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Exfoliation surface on the south side of\r\n    Owlshead Mountain. Joints, of the sheeting type, are visible in the\r\n    granite cliff. The decomposition of the granite by weathering in the\r\n    niches has resulted in small patches of soil. The boy in the upper\r\n    right gives the scale.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3.

Present topography, exaggerated.]\r\n\r\n  OWLSHEAD MOUNTAIN\r\n  RICKER MILLS\r\n\r\nEvidence that the granite was emplaced into the older rocks of the\r\nearth’s crust can be seen at certain locations outside of the State\r\nForest. At Ricker Mills, for example, narrow bodies of granite can be\r\nseen cross cutting the older rocks. A fuller description of the geology\r\nat Ricker Mills is given in a later section of this report. Another type\r\nof evidence showing that the granite came into older rocks is found in\r\nthe occurrence of fragments of older rock incorporated into the granite.\r\nThese are called _inclusions_ and represent broken pieces of older rock\r\nwhich were enveloped by the granite. Inclusions are like peach slices in\r\njello in that the surrounding material solidified after they were\r\ndropped in. Inclusions were observed in rocks on top of Kettle and Jerry\r\nLund Mountains.\r\n\r\nNear the covered picnic shelter at Ricker Pond, one of the large granite\r\nboulders deposited by the glacier contains inclusions. Although this\r\nboulder has been moved from its original occurrence, it probably has not\r\nmoved far as it is composed of the white granite which is typical of the\r\narea. It is cut by several pegmatitic dikes. The most interesting\r\nfeature is the occurrence of inclusions of elongate, layered bands of\r\nolder rocks of gray to dark gray _schist_.[3] These relations are shown\r\nin the sketch of this boulder in Figure 4. A careful examination of the\r\nschist inclusions reveals that they contain small plates of biotite in a\r\nfine matrix of quartz and more mica. The contact between the schist and\r\ngranite is gradational at places because when the rock was formed the\r\nhot molten granite was in the process of melting the solid schist. The\r\nschist resembles the rock which occurred in this area before the granite\r\nwas intruded and which occurs in nearby areas where no granite is\r\nexposed. Older rocks of somewhat similar appearance can be seen at\r\nRicker Mills and on top of Jerry Lund Mountain.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the granite at Groton State Forest is nearly the same\r\nas that which occurs throughout this region of Vermont. Incomplete\r\nmapping suggests that the granite at Groton is part of a large mass\r\nwhich extends to the southwest to the vicinity of East Barre.\r\nUndoubtedly all the granitic rocks of this region are related although\r\nthey are not continuous at the surface. They were all emplaced at about\r\nthe same time following a mountain-building episode in which the older\r\nrocks were folded and metamorphosed. On the geologic time scale, the\r\ngranites were emplaced near the end of the Devonian period which is\r\nestimated to be more than 300 million years ago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Sketch of boulder of granite containing\r\n    pegmatite band and schist inclusions at picnic area at Ricker Pond.]\r\n\r\n  GRANITE\r\n  PEGMATITE\r\n  SCHIST\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aplite and pegmatite_\r\n\r\nTwo other types of igneous rocks called aplite and pegmatite occur\r\nsparingly in Groton State Forest. Both of these are productions of\r\ncrystallization of residual fluids or late stage magma related to the\r\ngranite. These were emplaced along cracks or planes of weakness in the\r\ngranite after the granite had solidified. When viewed from the surface\r\nthe aplite or pegmatite generally appear as bands cutting through the\r\ngranite. However, when the third-dimension is considered it is easily\r\nrealized that they are tabular or sheet-like in shape. Igneous rock\r\nmasses having these dimensions are called _dikes_. At Groton most of the\r\ndikes are nearly vertical with a thickness ranging from less than an\r\ninch to more than several feet and extending for considerable distances.\r\nOn Owlshead, one of these dikes is nearly three feet thick. The extent\r\nof these dikes is not known because they are only partly exposed, in\r\nthat they extend beyond the limited areas of rock exposure.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:            GROTON STATE FOREST]\r\n\r\n    DREW MTN\r\n    NIGGERHEAD MTN\r\n    BLAKE HILL\r\n    NIGGERHEAD BROOK\r\n    KETTLE MTN\r\n    SPICER MTN\r\n    OWLSHEAD MTN\r\n    KETTLE POND\r\n    STILLWATER BK.\r\n    HARDWOOD RIDGE\r\n    BEAVER BROOK\r\n    SILVER LEDGE\r\n    LITTLE SPRUCE MTN\r\n    PEACHAM POND\r\n    DEER MTN\r\n    DEVIL’S HILL\r\n    PEACHAM BOG\r\n    LITTLE DEER MTN\r\n    OSMORE BK.\r\n    COLDWATER BK.\r\n    GROTON POND\r\n    JERRY LUND MTN\r\n    RICKER POND\r\n    RICKER MILLS\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    GRANITE EXPOSURES\r\n    SCHIST EXPOSURES\r\n    TRAIL\r\n    RAILROAD\r\n    SWAMPY AREAS\r\n    CONTOUR LINE WITH ELEVATION\r\n    CONTOUR INTERVAL IS 100 FEET\r\n      TOPOGRAPHY FROM U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS\r\n      BY ROBERT CHRISTMAN\r\n\r\nThe _pegmatite_ dikes are coarse-grained, in some cases consisting of\r\nindividual mineral grains as much as two to four inches in diameter. The\r\nmineral composition of the pegmatites is nearly the same as the granite,\r\nexcept that biotite is usually absent. Because of their larger grain\r\nsize, the minerals can be recognized more easily in pegmatites than in\r\neither granite or aplite. Quartz is glassy and breaks with smooth curved\r\nfractures. Feldspar is chalky white, or pink, and may occur as tabular\r\ncrystals with straight-line contacts. It tends to break along definite\r\nintersecting planes which can be seen in their reflecting position.\r\nMuscovite occurs as “books” of semi-transparent leaves. The large\r\n“books” of muscovite are particularly interesting because of the\r\nfascinating fact that a mineral sheet can be split along a given planar\r\ndirection into thinner and thinner sheets until they are too thin to\r\nhandle. Theoretically the mineral might be split into sheets only as\r\nthick as one layer of atoms. The ability of a mineral to break along\r\ndefinite planes is related to its atomic structure and is called\r\n_cleavage_. The cleavage in mica is perfect, whereas the cleavage in\r\nfeldspar is only poorly developed, and quartz does not possess cleavage\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe _aplite_ dikes are composed of nearly the same minerals as granite\r\nexcept that the average grain size is smaller. They are characterized by\r\nthe absence of dark minerals and muscovite and by a high quartz content\r\nwhich gives the rock a “sugary” appearance. Most of the aplite dikes are\r\nless than six inches thick.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the pegmatite and aplite dikes both cut through the granite,\r\nthey both must be younger in age than the granite. As is shown by the\r\nrelations between these two types on Owlshead (reproduced in Figure 5),\r\nthe pegmatite dike is younger because it cuts across the aplite dike.\r\nThis is the general age relationship for these dikes in this age.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. Sketch showing aplite and pegmatite dikes\r\n    in the granite on Owlshead Mountain. The cross cutting relations\r\n    show that the pegmatite is youngest and that aplite is younger than\r\n    the granite but older than the pegmatite. In the distance is Kettle\r\n    Pond and Kettle Mountain.]\r\n\r\n  GRANITE\r\n  APLITE\r\n  PEGMATITE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GLACIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the causes of the ice ages remain a matter for conjecture, the\r\nfact is established that the northern part of North America was covered\r\nby a thick sheet of moving ice several different times beginning about a\r\nmillion years ago. As the effect of the last glaciation erased much of\r\nthe evidence of previous glaciations, the present topography can be\r\nrelated to that last one. Rather accurate dating by measuring the\r\nradioactive decay of Carbon 14, indicates that the ice of the last\r\nglaciation retreated from the area about 12,000 years ago. Because the\r\nclimates between the four glaciations were as warm, if not warmer, than\r\nour present-day climate, geologists have speculated that the world may\r\nnow be in a warm period and that another ice age is scheduled to occur\r\nsome time in the distant future.\r\n\r\nThe effect of continental glaciation upon a land mass is twofold. First,\r\nthe glaciation acts as an erosive agent which tends to scoop out the\r\nareas of softer rock and wear down the areas of more resistant rock.\r\nSecondly, when the glacier begins to melt, it drops large quantities of\r\ngravel and boulders which had become incorporated within the glacier.\r\nMost of this material is picked up by the glacier as it moves over the\r\nland; some falls onto the glacier where it occupies a valley. Some of\r\nthe sand, gravel and boulder deposits left by the glacier are\r\ndistinctive in form and composition and others are characterized by\r\ntheir complete lack of distinctive shapes, and the utterly chaotic\r\nnature of the material deposited. The deposits at Groton State Forest\r\nseem to be the latter type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Erosion and deposition by the glacier_\r\n\r\nThe shape of Spicer, Owlshead, Little Deer and Big Deer mountains are\r\nprimarily the result of the erosive action of the glacier as it\r\ncontinually moved southward over the land for a great number of years\r\nduring the last glaciation. When a continental glacier encounters a hill\r\nor mountain of resistant rock, it tends to scour the rock on the up-ice\r\nside of the hill and to “pluck out” the rocks on the leeward side. For\r\nthis reason these mountains have broad gentle slopes on the side from\r\nwhich the glacier came and they drop off sharply on the side from which\r\nmaterial was removed by plucking action. The last part of Figure 3\r\nillustrates how these mountains may have been formed. Such prominent\r\nrock exposures which have been subjected to glacial erosion originally\r\nshowed deep scratches, called _glacial striae_, cut by cobbles dragged\r\nalong the bottom of the glacier. Unfortunately, on most prominences in\r\nGroton State Forest exfoliation of the rock has erased these markings;\r\nbut it is possible that striae may be found on recently uncovered rock\r\nexposures.\r\n\r\nThe depressions in which Groton and Osmore ponds are located probably\r\nrepresent areas in which the glacier scooped out material to a greater\r\ndepth than elsewhere either because of channeling of bottom flow between\r\ntopographically prominent features, or because of subtle differences in\r\nrock hardness.\r\n\r\nWhen the glacier retreated, that is when it was melting faster than it\r\nwas advancing, it dropped material in a helter-skelter manner. _End\r\nmoraines_, which are ridges of gravel formed where the front of the\r\nglacier was stationary because of a close balance between rates of\r\nmovement and melting, are not evident in Groton State Forest. As far as\r\ncan be determined, the material was deposited irregularly over the\r\nentire area, so that boulders dropped by the glacier are found\r\neverywhere. These are particularly noticeable around the lakes where the\r\nfine material has been removed and the soil and forest cover does not\r\nhide the boulders.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the boulders deposited by the glacier are composed of\r\nwhite granite similar to the rock which underlies the entire area. This\r\nindicates that most of the boulders have not been transported very far.\r\nHowever, occasionally boulders are found which are not characteristic of\r\nthe area and represent rocks brought in from the north. Such boulders\r\nwhich are foreign to the area in which they are found are called\r\n_erratics_. Most erratics in this area are dark-colored metamorphosed\r\nrocks in which the minerals are oriented to give the rock a layered\r\npattern. These are called either _gneisses_ or _schists_ depending on\r\nwhether the layering is coarse or fine. Deposits of the glacier are\r\nexposed in two gravel or sand pits near the Stillwater Camp site. These\r\ndeposits are composed principally of sand but contain scattered boulders\r\nof different sizes. A few erratics are found in these\r\ndeposits—particularly a variety of rock which weathers to a soft, brown\r\nporous mass resembling decayed wood. These sandy deposits probably were\r\nplastered onto the ground from the sole of the creeping glacier or were\r\nsimply let down as the glacier wasted away.\r\n\r\nBecause of the irregular manner in which the glacier may deposit its\r\nload of sand and gravel, the topography in such areas is uneven and\r\ncharacterized by poor drainage. At a number of places in Groton swampy\r\nareas occur at higher elevation which might normally be expected to be\r\nwell-drained. Some of these areas have become the sites of beaver dams\r\nbecause they are ideal for damming up the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GEOLOGY OF NEARBY AREAS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ricker Mills_\r\n\r\nJust south of the park at Ricker Mills some of the oldest rocks in the\r\narea are exposed in the railroad cut just north of the highway crossing.\r\nThese rocks belong to a thick sequence of similar rocks which are\r\ncollectively called the _Waits River formation_. Studies in other areas\r\nindicate that these rocks belong to the portion of geologic time called\r\nthe Ordovician period which was more than 350 million years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Waits River formation represents a series of sediments which\r\naccumulated at the bottom of a shallow sea during Ordovician time. These\r\nsediments included both limy and sandy beds, and fossils may originally\r\nhave been preserved in some of the beds. Sediments of other types later\r\naccumulated over the Waits River formation during a long period of\r\ngeologic time, so that eventually the formation became deeply buried.\r\n(See Figure 3.) The sea retreated and the rocks were subjected to high\r\npressure and temperatures during a period of mountain-building. The\r\nrocks which had been sedimentary were folded and converted to\r\n_metamorphic rocks_ by partial melting and recrystallization of the\r\ncomponents. As a result the rocks became schists or marbles. Any fossils\r\nwhich may have been present were destroyed or badly altered in the\r\nprocess. This is unfortunate because valuable geologic information as\r\nthe age of the rocks can be determined from the type of fossils present.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Waits River formation at Ricker Mills are dominantly\r\nmica schists with layers containing limy material. These are too impure\r\nto be considered marble but enough lime is present so that they react\r\nstrongly with acid, a test for detecting the presence of lime. The\r\nschists principally contain quartz, biotite, calcite (lime) with lesser\r\namounts of muscovite, feldspar and impurities. The rocks weather to dark\r\ncolors; the gray limy beds are particularly susceptible to weathering\r\nand turn dark brown to black on the surface. When more lime is present,\r\nthe rock weathers to a deep brown porous rock which resembles decayed\r\nwood. Some boulders of these altered limestones are found in the glacial\r\ndeposits in the State Forest.\r\n\r\nAn additional factor which makes the rocks in the railroad cut at Ricker\r\nMills look “messy” is the iron and manganese staining and the formation\r\nof mineral crusts on the surface of the rocks through the action of\r\nground water. Rain water falling on the hills above passes through the\r\nsoils, dissolving minerals, and precipitating them where the water seeps\r\nout and evaporates at the lower level of the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nThe schists trend about N.80°W. and dip about 30° to the northeast.\r\nAlong the length of the rock exposures it can be seen that this dip is\r\nnot constant but varies from 10 to 30°. The variation in dip gives the\r\nschists a wavy appearance.\r\n\r\nAt two places along the railroad cut, the schist has been intruded by\r\ngranite. As is shown in Figure 6, which is a sketch of the rocks exposed\r\non the east side of the railroad, the granite forms vertical dikes. As\r\nthe schist ends abruptly at the contact of the granite, this indicates\r\nthat the granite formed after the schist. The granite is nearly the same\r\nas the granite in Groton State Forest except that the mica is muscovite\r\nrather than biotite. For this reason the granite is lighter in color on\r\nfresh surfaces. In general the exterior is dark in color due to the\r\nstaining of iron from weathering of the mineral pyrite, an iron sulfide,\r\nwhich occurs in small amounts in the granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jerry Lund Mountain_\r\n\r\nOn top of Jerry Lund Mountain occur other outcrops of the Waits River\r\nformation and granite. Their exact relationships cannot be seen easily\r\nbecause of the thick vegetation. The Waits River formation on Jerry Lund\r\nMountain is composed principally of quartz mica schist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TRIPS TO TAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hiking in the State Forest_\r\n\r\nThe hike from the end of the road to the top of Owlshead Mountain takes\r\nonly ten to fifteen minutes. A splendid view of the surrounding area,\r\nparticularly Groton and Kettle ponds, is obtained from here. If\r\npossible, everyone who visits the park should take this short walk. The\r\ngranite is well-exposed at the summit and dikes of aplite and pegmatite\r\nmay be seen.\r\n\r\nThe more venturesome park visitor will want to make other trips away\r\nfrom the “beaten path” into the wilderness of the Vermont woods. The\r\nprincipal difficulty arises in that the wilderness is so real a person\r\nmay well become lost if he strays too far from the trails. Some of the\r\ntrails have become overgrown so that they are difficult to follow and\r\nportions of others have been destroyed by the damming up of brooks by\r\nthe beavers. It is suggested that in planning hikes information be\r\nobtained from the park superintendent about the condition of the various\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Diagrammatic sketch showing the relations\r\n    between the schist of the Waits River formation and the granite on\r\n    the east side of the railroad cut, at Ricker Mills.]\r\n\r\n  GRANITE\r\n  WAITS RIVER FORMATION\r\n\r\nAn interesting hike can be made from Osmore Pond to Deer Mountain but as\r\nthe trail is poorly marked, one must maintain a sense of direction. From\r\nthe Osmore picnic area walk south near the shore of the pond to its\r\noutlet into Osmore Brook. At this point turn left to the northeast and\r\nfollow the trail which parallels a wire marking the edge of the game\r\npreserve. About three-fourths of a mile from Osmore Brook the trail\r\nmeets another trail at right angles. To the left the trail follows the\r\ngame preserve boundary northwestward. The trail to the right leads\r\ndirectly to the top of Deer Mountain where a view may be obtained on the\r\nsouth side of the summit. As an alternate route for returning, follow\r\nthe trail along the game preserve to the northwest. Some distance beyond\r\na shelter-lean-to the trail divides several times with the main trail\r\nleading to Blake Hill and other trails to the left leading to the Osmore\r\nPond road.\r\n\r\nA hike along the trail on the north side of Kettle Pond to the\r\nshelter-lean-tos makes a pleasant trip along the water. Also, the trail\r\nfrom Owlshead Mountain to Osmore Pond is convenient for a short hike\r\nthrough the woods, if the trail can be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quarries at East Barre_\r\n\r\nThe granite quarries at East Barre are in nearly the same type of rock\r\nas that which occurs at Groton State Forest. The quarry operations are\r\ninteresting and educational and the quarries afford a good opportunity\r\nof seeing fresh, unaltered specimens of granite. Guide service is\r\noffered at some of the quarries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]_Granite_ is a type of igneous rock consisting of large interlocking\r\n    grains of light-colored minerals. Rocks are classified as being\r\n    either igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. _Igneous_ rocks form by\r\n    the solidification of molten material; _sedimentary_ rocks form by\r\n    the accumulation of sediments derived from older rocks; and\r\n    _metamorphic_ rocks form by the recrystallization of older rocks\r\n    under conditions of high temperatures and pressures.\r\n\r\n[2]_Dip_ is the inclination of a surface as, for example, a joint\r\n    surface described above.\r\n\r\n[3]_Schist_ is the name given to rocks in which the minerals have a\r\n    parallel alignment due to reorganization of the rock constituents\r\n    during a condition of high temperature and pressure. The platy\r\n    minerals, like mica, form at right angles to the pressure so that\r\n    the resulting rock may have a “bedded” appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Looking northwest over Groton Pond toward Owlshead\r\n    Mountain]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Looking north over Groton Pond toward Little Deer\r\n    Mountain]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
