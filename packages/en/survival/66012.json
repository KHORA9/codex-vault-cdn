Resour.\r\nRes. Work Unit 1976). This material is usually wasted; if the site is\r\nprepared for regeneration to pine, the hardwoods there are destroyed.\r\nResearch is underway to find economical methods of harvesting and\r\nutilizing these hardwoods. The descriptions, key, and illustrations in\r\nthis book should help wood utilization researchers, especially those new\r\nto the South, to identify the most prevalent hardwood species on\r\nsouthern pine sites (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.—_Important hardwoods on southern pine sites, ranked according\r\nto percentage of total hardwood volume_\r\n\r\n  Percentages were derived from Staff, For. Resour. Res.

They are\r\nmonoecious; that is, the stamens and pistil are borne in separate\r\nflowers on the same plant. Flowers generally develop after the leaves\r\nare three-fourths to full grown. Staminate flowers are in catkins, which\r\noccur on last year’s wood and usually have three branches. The stalkless\r\npistillate flowers are in several-flowered spikes at the apex of the\r\ncurrent season’s growth. Catkins last from 10 days to 3 weeks and are\r\nusually not useful in distinguishing the species. The fruit, however, is\r\nwidely used for identification. The husk may be very thin (about 1 mm),\r\nmoderately thick (3 to 5 mm), or very thick (more than 5 mm). Similarly,\r\nthe shell may be thin, moderately thick, or very thick. The meat varies\r\nfrom sweet to bitter. Upon drying, the husk usually separates along\r\nsutures and frees the nut. In some species the husk partly splits at the\r\nsutures but still encloses the nut when it falls. Such nuts are usually\r\nsterile, because the meat is seldom filled out.\r\n\r\nFor identification purposes use nuts from the ground with caution; if\r\nmore than one species grows in the vicinity, the fruits could be mixed.\r\nAlso some trees shed defective or sterile fruits early, and these fruits\r\nare often different in shape and size from typical fruit.\r\n\r\nHickories are generally divided into true hickories, which have\r\noverlapping (imbricate) bud scales, and pecan hickories, which have\r\nvalvate bud scales. True hickories are divided into those with tight\r\nbark and those with loose bark. Mockernut Hickory, _Carya tomentosa_\r\nNutt., a tight bark species, has very pubescent leaves, large buds, and\r\na thick husk over a large nut. Pignut Hickory, _C. glabra_ (Mill.)\r\nSweet, also a tight bark hickory, has three to nine glabrous leaflets\r\nand a tardily dehiscing husk about 3 mm thick. Shagbark Hickory, _C.\r\novata_ (Mill.) K. Koch, is one of the few species with bark in thin,\r\nloose plates. It has small buds and usually has five leaflets. Bitternut\r\nHickory, _C. cordiformis_ (Wangenh.) K. Koch, belongs to the pecan\r\nhickory group and has yellow buds with valvate scales. It also has tight\r\nbark, thin four-winged husks, thin shells, and bitter meat.\r\n\r\nOaks are also monoecious, and staminate flowers are in drooping catkins,\r\nwhich consist of a central, flexible axis with sessile, apetalous and\r\npubescent flowers. They are most abundant on the developing new twigs.\r\nAlthough catkins vary among oaks, they are usually not used as\r\ndistinguishing characteristics because they last only 2 to 3 weeks.\r\nPistillate flowers occur on wood of the previous season and in leaf\r\naxils of twigs. In red oaks, however, pistillate flowers on current\r\ntwigs do not mature until the second fall.\r\n\r\nThe fruit, a nut or acorn, consists of the seed enclosed in a shell. The\r\nnut is seated in a cup consisting of many scales. At maturity nuts are\r\nshed from the tree by shrinkage of the cup (dehydration). Considerable\r\nvariation in mature acorn size occurs among trees of a species, notably\r\nin water oak, willow oak, and white oak.\r\n\r\nDifferences in foliage within a species also complicate identification.\r\nApparently because lower leaves receive less sunlight they differ in\r\nsize and appearance from those in the middle or upper crown. Most\r\ntaxonomists prefer a specimen from the upper half of the crown because\r\nthey consider leaves from this area typical for the species. To get such\r\nspecimens easily, use a tree pruner and take leaves from at least 20 to\r\n30 feet off the ground or collect them from freshly felled trees.\r\nMoreover, foliage of seedlings and small saplings often differs from\r\nthat of mature trees, and spring and summer growth flushes on the same\r\nbranch often appear markedly different. This seasonal variation has been\r\nnoted for many oaks, including laurel, post, blackjack, and especially\r\nwater oak. For example, by late March or April, water oak leaves reach\r\ntheir normal size and shape—obovate with a wavy apex; the second flush\r\nof growth, which starts in late April or May, produces lobed leaves.\r\n\r\nIdentification is further complicated because hybrids commonly occur\r\namong the oaks.\r\n\r\nThe oaks are divided into two main groups: the white oaks and the red\r\n(or black) oaks. The white oaks have leaves with rounded lobes and no\r\nbristles; acorns mature the first fall, and the inner surface of the\r\nshell is glabrous. White oak, chestnut oak, and post oak belong to this\r\ngroup. The red oak group is characterized by bristle-tipped leaf lobes\r\nin such species as Shumard, southern red, northern red, cherrybark, and\r\nblack oak. The red oak group also includes non-lobed species such as\r\nwater, laurel, and willow oak, which usually have entire margins.\r\nBlackjack oak leaves usually lack lobes and bristles, but leaves with\r\nterminal lobes occasionally occur and may have one bristle per lobe.\r\nAcorns mature the second fall, and the inner surface of the shell is\r\npubescent.\r\n\r\nSouthern Red Oak, _Quercus falcata_ Michx., and its variety Cherrybark\r\nOak, _Q. falcata_ var. _pagodaefolia_ Ell., have almost identical\r\nacorns, but they can be distinguished by other characteristics. The leaf\r\nbase of southern red oak is somewhat bell-shaped, but that of cherrybark\r\nis not. Southern red oak forms heavy ridges of bark; cherrybark does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of Black Oak, _Q. velutina_ Lam., is its\r\nyellow-orange inner bark. Its leaves take three forms. Seedlings to\r\nsmall saplings have a “bear-paw” leaf with only a suggestion of lobing.\r\nLower leaves on large trees also have little lobing, but leaves from the\r\nmiddle and upper crown are clearly lobed. The uppermost leaves, which\r\nhave seven lobes and deep sinuses, are usually illustrated as typical.\r\n\r\nScarlet, _Q. coccinea_ Muenchh., Northern Red, _Q. rubra_ L., and\r\nShumard Oak, _Q. shumardii_ Buckl., are difficult to distinguish.\r\nNorthern red oak leaves have shallow sinuses and a dull-green upper\r\nsurface with little or no pubescence in the vein axils on the underside.\r\nShumard oak leaves have a glossier surface, shallow to deep sinuses that\r\nare usually wider than the adjacent lobes, and definite hairiness at the\r\nvein axils. The sinuses of scarlet oak are also usually wider than their\r\nadjacent lobes, which are usually toothed. Both Shumard and scarlet oak\r\nhave outstanding fall coloration.\r\n\r\nBlackjack Oak, _Q. marilandica_ Muenchh., can be recognized by its\r\nleathery, usually entire, broadly obovate leaf, which has a rusty\r\nundersurface. The branches are stout, irregular, gnarled, drooping to\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nLaurel Oak, _Q. laurifolia_ Michx., and Water Oak, _Q. nigra_ L., are\r\nsimilar in size and shape, but water oak has oblong-obovate or\r\nspatula-shaped leaves gradually narrowed to a wedge-shaped base. Laurel\r\noak leaves are elliptic to oblong-ovate. Laurel oaks tend to shed leaves\r\nlate and thus may retain about 30 to 50 percent of their lower leaves\r\nafter water oaks are bare. Some recent authors separate the laurel oaks\r\ninto two species, upland laurel oak, _Q. hemisphaerica_ Bartr., and\r\nswamp laurel oak, _Q. laurifolia_ Michx.\r\n\r\nWhite Oak, _Q. alba_ L., has a thin, light green leaf with a light\r\nglaucous bloom at maturity; it is oblong or ovate, with rounded lobes\r\nand three to five narrow sinuses extending nearly to the mid-rib. The\r\ncup scales of the acorn-cup are heavy and distinct.\r\n\r\nPost Oak, _Q. stellata_ Wangenh., has stout, irregular branches. The\r\nleathery leaves are usually five-lobed; usually the two side lobes are\r\nat right angles to the central axis, thus forming a cross-shaped leaf.\r\n\r\nChestnut Oak, _Q. prinus_ L., resembles swamp chestnut oak, _Q.\r\nmichauxii_ Nutt., a commercially important tree southwide. Chestnut oak\r\nis primarily a northeastern tree, extending into the South along the\r\nAppalachian highlands into northern Georgia and Alabama where its range\r\noverlaps that of swamp chestnut oak, and its leaves lack the dense\r\npubescence found on those of swamp chestnut oak.\r\n\r\nCommon elms include American Elm, _Ulmus americana_ L., and Winged Elm,\r\n_U. alata_ Michx. Both bloom after a freeze breaks dormancy. For\r\nexample, if a killing frost occurs in the last week of November or the\r\nfirst week of December, American elm will bloom the first week of\r\nJanuary. If no killing frost occurs by early December. American elm may\r\nnot bloom until the third week of January. Winged elm usually blooms 10\r\ndays to 2 weeks later than American elm. Small winged elm trees\r\nfrequently have a corky outgrowth on opposite sides of twigs at least 3\r\nyears old. Mature trees often lack this characteristic. The American elm\r\nleaf has unequal basal lobing and pubescent or ciliate samaras about 12\r\nmm in diameter; winged elm has a smaller leaf with round to acute leaf\r\nbases and a very ciliate samara about 8 mm long.\r\n\r\nYoung Sugarberry, _Celtis laevigata_ Willd., and Hackberry, _C.\r\noccidentalis_ L., trees are readily recognized by a whitish to light\r\ngray bark dotted with small corky warts. Older trees often have\r\nrelatively smooth, light to medium gray bark. Leaf margins of sugarberry\r\nare usually entire or indistinctly toothed; the upper half of hackberry\r\nleaves are usually conspicuously serrate. Both species produce tiny\r\nflowers on the new growth when the leaves are about half normal size.\r\nThe fruit of sugarberry is orange-red to black; that of hackberry is\r\ndark red to nearly black at maturity.\r\n\r\nYellow-poplar, _Liriodendron tulipifera_ L., or tulip tree, has\r\nalternate, four- to six-lobed leaves with truncate to distinctly notched\r\napices, a unique feature among American trees. The flowers are\r\ntulip-like with red markings on a greenish-yellow background. The fruit\r\nis a cone-like aggregate of samaras.\r\n\r\nSweetbay, _Magnolia virginiana_ L., produces moderate-sized trunks on\r\nuplands or numerous pole-like suckers in branch bottoms. It is evergreen\r\nin the southern part of its range and deciduous in the northern portion.\r\nA wind blowing in the crown will expose the silvery underside of the\r\nleaves. The white flowers, about 5 to 10 cm in diameter, open for the\r\nfirst time about 3 p.m. and close about 9 p.m. They reopen the next\r\nmorning and shed their stamens. The fruit is a green pickle-like\r\naggregate of follicles that splits open to reveal red seeds. Sweetbay\r\nand yellow-poplar, both members of the Magnolia family, have stipule\r\nscars circling the twigs.\r\n\r\nSweetgum, _Liquidambar styraciflua_ L., or redgum, is easily recognized\r\nby its alternate, star-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. Some trees have\r\ncorky outgrowths on the small branches. Its flower consists of several\r\nround clusters of stamens arranged in a raceme and a stalked pistillate\r\nhead that develops into a spiny, woody fruit containing many seeds.\r\n\r\nRed Maple, _Acer rubrum_ L., has simple, opposite leaves that are\r\nusually glaucous and pubescent. The flowers appear in early February and\r\nthe fruit is a double samara. The variety _A. rubrum_ var. _drummondii_\r\n(Hook. and Arn.) Sarg., which has densely matted white hairs on the\r\nundersides of young leaves, grows in swamps throughout the South. Leaves\r\nmay have three to five lobes, but southern trees are predominantly\r\nthree-lobed. For this reason, some authors recognize the southern form\r\nas _A. rubrum_ var. _tridens_ Woods.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of Black Tupelo (blackgum) _Nyssa sylvatica_ Marsh., are\r\nalternate, elliptical to obovate, and become spotted early in their\r\ndevelopment, turning purplish in September before their early shedding.\r\nThe flowers are small, inconspicuous, and produce a blue-black fruit.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most common ashes are White Ash, _Fraxinus americana_ L., and\r\nGreen Ash, _F. pennsylvanica_ Marsh. The most reliable distinction\r\nbetween the two species appears to be samara differences. White ash has\r\na plump, short seed end with the wing practically terminal, whereas\r\ngreen ash has a slender seed end and the wing extends more than halfway\r\ndown the seed end. White ash usually has a rounded leaflet base, but\r\ngreen ash has wedge-shaped leaflet bases. The undersurfaces of fresh\r\nwhite ash leaves are white, but the color is difficult to detect on dry\r\nspecimens. Green ash leaves are green on both surfaces, although\r\nsomewhat paler on undersurfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Key To Hardwoods\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key is composed of paired statements, one true and one false for any\r\ngiven specimen.
