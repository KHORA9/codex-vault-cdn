He was only nine years old, but\r\nhe was my tenderly loved companion, and was in no small degree the\r\ncreator of this story. He gave it the title it bears; he discussed with\r\nme every incident in it; and every page was written with reference to\r\nhis wishes and his pleasure. There is not a paragraph here which does\r\nnot hold for me some reminder of the noblest, manliest, most unselfish\r\nboy I have ever known. Ah, woe is me! He who was my companion is my dear\r\ndead boy now, and I am sure that I only act for him as he would wish, in\r\ninscribing the story that was so peculiarly his to the boy whom he loved\r\nbest, and who loved him as a brother might have done. It is in memory of\r\nGUILFORD that I dedicate \"The Wreck of the Red Bird\" to CHARLES PELTON\r\nHUTCHINS.\r\n\r\nG. C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        CHAPTER I.

Well, I do declar'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Maum Sally,\" replied Ned Cooke, \"stop 'declaring' and stop asking\r\nme questions till you answer mine. Or, no, you won't do that, so I'll\r\nanswer yours first. Where did I come from? Why from Aiken, by way of\r\nCharleston and Hardeeville. Did I come to visit the folks? Well, no, not\r\nexactly that. You see, I didn't set out to come here at all. I have\r\nspent part of the summer up at Aiken with these two school-mates of\r\nmine, and they were to spend the rest of it with me in Savannah. We were\r\non our way down there when I got a despatch from father, saying that as\r\nyellow fever has broken out there I mustn't come home, but must come\r\ndown here to Bluffton and stay with Uncle Edward till frost or school\r\ntime. So we got off the train, hired a man with an ox-cart to bring our\r\ntrunks down, and walked the eighteen miles. The man with the trunks will\r\nget here sometime, I suppose. There! I've made a long speech at you.\r\nNow, answer my questions, please. Where is Uncle Edward? and where is\r\nAunt Helen? and why is the house shut up? and when will they be back\r\nagain? and can't you give us something to eat, for we're nearly\r\nstarved?\"\r\n\r\nNed laughed as he delivered this volley of questions, but Maum Sally\r\nremained perfectly solemn, as she always did. When he finished, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Yaller fever! Bress my heart! It'll be heah nex' thing we knows. Walked\r\nall de way from Hardeeville! an' dis heah hot day too! e'en a'most\r\nstarved! Well, I reckon ye is, an' I'll jes mosey roun' heah an' git you\r\nsome supper.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be explained that Maum Sally, although she lived on the coast of\r\nSouth Carolina, and was called \"Maum\" instead of \"Aunt,\" was born and\r\n\"raised,\" as she would have said, in \"Ole Firginny,\" and her dialect was\r\ntherefore somewhat as represented here. The negroes of the coast speak a\r\npeculiar jargon, which would be wholly unintelligible to other than\r\nSouth Carolinian readers, even if I could render it faithfully by\r\nphonetic spelling.\r\n\r\nAs Maum Sally ceased speaking, she turned to go into her kitchen, which,\r\nas is usual in the South, was a detached building, standing some\r\ndistance from the main house.\r\n\r\n\"But wait, Maum Sally,\" cried Ned, seizing her hand; \"I'm not going to\r\nlet you off that way. You haven't answered my questions yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look heah, young Ned,\" she said, with great solemnity, \"does you\r\ns'pose Ole Sally was bawn and raised in Ole Firginny for nothin'? I aint\r\nforgot my manners nor hospitality, ef I _is_ lived nigh onto twenty-five\r\nyears in dis heah heathen coast country whah de niggas talks monkey\r\nlanguage. I'se a gwine to git you'n your fr'en's--ef you'll interduce\r\n'em--some supper, fust an' foremost. Den I'll answer all de questions\r\nyou're a mind to ax, ef you don't git to conundrumin'.\"\r\n\r\nNed acknowledged Maum Sally's rebuke promptly.\r\n\r\n\"I did forget my manners,\" he said, \"but you see I was badly flustered.\r\nThis is my friend Jack Farnsworth, Maum Sally, and this,\" turning to the\r\nother boy, \"is Charley Black. Boys, let me make you acquainted with Maum\r\nSally, the best cook in South Carolina, or anywhere else, and the best\r\nMaum Sally in the world. She used to give me all sorts of good things to\r\neat out here when I didn't get up to breakfast, and was expected to get\r\non till dinner with a cold bite from the store-room. I'll bet she'll\r\ncook us a supper that will make your mouths water, and have it ready by\r\nthe time we get the dust out of our eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Git de dus' out'n de all over you, more like. Heah's de key to de\r\nbath-house. You jes run down an' take a dip in de salt water, an' den\r\ngit inter yer clo'es as fas' as you kin, an' when you's done dat, you'll\r\nfin' somethin' to eat awaitin' for you in de piazza. Git, now, quick. Ef\r\nI'se got to plan somethin' for supper, I'se got to hab my wits about me\r\nan' don' want no talkin' boys aroun'.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use, boys,\" said Ned. \"I know Maum Sally, and we're not\r\ngoing to get a word more out of her till supper is ready, so come on,\r\nlet's have a plunge. It's all right, anyhow. My uncle and aunt have gone\r\naway for the day somewhere, I suppose, and will be back sometime\r\nto-night. If they don't come, I'll find a way to break into the house.\r\nIt's my father's, you know, and one of my homes. In fact, I was born\r\nhere. Uncle Edward lives here a good part of the time, because he likes\r\nit, and father lives in Savannah a good part of the year, because he\r\ndoesn't like it here. Come, let's get a bath.\"\r\n\r\nWith that Ned conducted his guests to a pretty little bath-house which\r\nstood out over the water, and was approached by a green bridge. Bluffton\r\nabounds in these well-appointed, private bathing-houses, which, with\r\ntheir ornamental approaches, add not a little to the beauty of the\r\nsingular town, which is scarcely a town at all in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word, as Ned explained to his companions while they were dressing\r\nafter their bath.\r\n\r\n\"This coast country,\" he said, \"is plagued with country fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's country fever?\" asked Jack Farnsworth.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very severe and fatal form of bilious fever, which one night's\r\nexposure--or even a few hours' exposure after sunset--brings on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you bring us here?\" asked Charley. \"Are we to find\r\nourselves down with country fever to-morrow morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all,\" replied Ned. \"Country fever stays strictly at home. It\r\nnever goes to town; it never visits high ground where there are pines,\r\nwhite sand, and no moss; and it never comes to Bluffton. That's why\r\nthere is any Bluffton. All along the coast the planters have their\r\nwinter residences on their plantations, but in the summer they go off to\r\nlittle summer villages in the pines to escape the fever. In the region\r\njust around us, it is so much easier and pleasanter to live here in\r\nBluffton that they build permanent residences here and live here all the\r\nyear around. There is no trade here, no shops--except a blacksmith shop\r\nout on the road--no stores, no any thing except private houses, and the\r\nprivate houses are all built pretty nearly alike. Each stands alone in a\r\nlarge plot of ground, which is filled with trees and shrubs just as all\r\nthe streets are. Each house has a piazza running all the way around it,\r\nor pretty nearly that, and each has two or three joggling boards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is a joggling board?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"I'll introduce you when we get back to the house,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys returned to the house, Ned's prediction was abundantly\r\nfulfilled. Maum Sally had spread a tempting, if somewhat incongruous\r\nsupper in the piazza. There was a piece of cold ham, some fried fresh\r\nfish, a dish of shrimps stewed with tomatoes, a great platter of rice\r\ncooked in the South Carolinian way, and intended for use in lieu of\r\nbread, some boiled okra, roast sweet potatoes, and a pot of steaming\r\ncoffee. It was a miscellaneous sort of meal, compounded of breakfast,\r\ndinner, and supper in about equal proportions, but it was such a meal as\r\nthree healthy boys, who had walked eighteen miles and had then taken a\r\nsea bath, were not in the least disposed to quarrel with.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Maum Sally,\" said Ned, after he had complimented the supper and\r\ntaken his seat at the table, \"tell me where Uncle Edward and Aunt Helen\r\nare, and when they will get back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't ye got no manners at all, young Ned?\" asked Sally, with an air of\r\nprofound surprise; she always called the boy \"Young Ned\" when she wished\r\nto put him in awe of her; \"ain't ye got no manners at all, or is you\r\nforgot 'em all sence I seed you last? Don' you know your frien's is a\r\nstarvin'? and here you is a plaguin' me with questions insti'd o'\r\nhelpin' on 'em. Mind yer manners, young gentleman, an' then I'll answer\r\nyer questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Maum Sally,\" said Ned; \"Charley, let me give you some cold\r\nham. Jack, help yourself to some fish. There are the shrimps, boys,\r\nbetween you. Maum Sally, pour out some coffee, please. Jack, you'll find\r\nthe okra good; here, Charley, let me help you to rice.\"\r\n\r\nMaum Sally, meanwhile, was pouring coffee and filling plates; when\r\nsupper was well under way, she stood back a little way, placed her hands\r\non her hips, her arms akimbo, and said with the utmost solemnity:\r\n\r\n\"Seems 's if somebody axed me somethin' or other 'bout de folks when I\r\nwas too busy to ten' to 'em. Ef you'll ax me agin now, I'll be\r\nobleeged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, upon reflection,\" said Ned, \"I am inclined to think that I\r\nventured to make some inquiry concerning my uncle and aunt. If I\r\nremember correctly, I asked where they are, and at what time they are\r\nlikely to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whah is dey? Well, I don' rightly know, an' I can't say adzac'ly when\r\ndey'll be back agin. But I specs deys somewhah out on de sea, an' I\r\ns'pose dey'll be back about nex' November.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Ned, in surprise, suspending his attention to supper, and\r\nforgetting to maintain his pretence of dignified indifference. \"What do\r\nyou mean, Maum Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what I mean is dis heah. Yo' uncle an' aunt lef' here three days\r\nago to go north. Dey said dey was a gwine to de centenimental\r\nexpedition, an' to Newport an' somewhahs else--I reckon it was to some\r\nsort o' mountains--White Mountains, mebbe, an dey said dey'd be back\r\nagin in November, ef dey didn't make up dere minds to stay longer, or\r\ncome back afore dat time. So now you knows as much about it as I does.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON THE JOGGLING BOARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo say that Ned was surprised is to describe his feeling very mildly.\r\nKnowing his uncle's easy, indolent mode of life, his contentment with\r\nhome, his lazy love of books and pipes and ease generally, Ned would as\r\nsoon have expected to hear that the organ in the little church had gone\r\noff summering, as to learn that his uncle and aunt were travelling.\r\n\r\nThe other boys were in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth shall we do?\" asked Jack Farnsworth.\r\n\r\n\"Better eat supper, fust an' fo'most,\" replied Maum Sally, whose theory\r\nof life consisted of a profound conviction that the important thing to\r\nbe done was to eat an abundance of good food, well-cooked.\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Ned. \"We can't bring my uncle back by neglecting our\r\nsupper, but we can let the coffee get cold, and that would be a pity.\r\nLet's eat now while the things are hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Charley Black, \"that's all right, but after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, after that we'll try the joggling boards.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ned,\" remonstrated Charley, \"this won't do. Your uncle has gone\r\naway, and the house is shut up and so we can't stay here. Now, I move\r\nthat you go back to Aiken with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" answered Ned. \"I've visited at your house and at\r\nJack's, and now you're my guests. Do you think I've 'forgot my manners,'\r\nas Maum Sally says?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ned,\" said Jack, \"you see the situation has changed since we\r\nstarted to go home with you. You can't go home, and now you can't stay\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I though?\" asked Ned; \"and why not? I know a way into the house,\r\nand if you'll stay where you are for five minutes, I'll have the big\r\ndoors unbarred and invite you in.\"\r\n\r\nWith that Ned stepped upon the piazza railing, caught a timber above,\r\nand easily swung himself up to the roof of the porch. Thence he made his\r\nway quickly to a round window in the garret--the house was only one\r\nstory high, with a high garret story for the protection of the rooms\r\nfrom the heat of the sun. Pushing open this round window he sprang in,\r\ndescended the stairs, and a moment later the boys heard him taking down\r\nthe wooden bar which kept the great double doors fast. Then drawing the\r\nbolts at top and bottom, he swung the doors open without difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, boys,\" he cried. \"I'll open the doors at the other side, and\r\nwe'll have a breeze through the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, old fellow,\" said Charley, \"I don't like this. What will\r\nyour uncle think of us for making free with his house in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Uncle Edward? Why, he wouldn't ask how we got in if he were to\r\nget home now. He never troubles himself, and he's the best uncle in the\r\nworld; so is Aunt Helen, or, I should say, she is the best aunt. And,\r\nbesides, I tell you, this isn't Uncle Edward's house. It's my father's,\r\nand all the furniture is his too. Uncle Edward lives here just because\r\nhe likes it here, and because father likes to have him here. But the\r\nhouse is ours, and sometimes we all come here without warning, and stay\r\nfor months. It don't make any difference, except that more plates are\r\nput on the table. Every thing goes on just the same, and if Uncle Edward\r\nwere to come in now he would hardly remember that we weren't here when\r\nhe went away. So make yourselves easy. You're in my home just as much as\r\nif we were in Savannah, and there's nobody here to be bothered by our\r\nfun. We'll stay here and fish and row and bathe, and have a jolly time.\r\nThe servants have all gone away, I suppose, except Maum Sally, but\r\nshe'll take good care of us. You see, I'm her special pet. She has\r\nthought it her duty to coddle me and scold me and regulate me generally\r\never since I was born, and she likes nothing better. So come on out here\r\nand I'll introduce you unfortunate up-country boys to that greatest of\r\nhuman inventions, a joggling board. There are four or five of them on\r\nthe front piazza.\"\r\n\r\nThis hospitable harangue satisfied the scruples of the boys, and the\r\nhouse was so pleasant, with its large, high rooms, wide hall, and broad\r\npiazzas--one of which looked out over the water,--the grounds were so\r\ntasteful, the trees so large and fine, and the whole aspect of Bluffton\r\nwas so quiet and restful, that they were glad to settle themselves\r\ncontentedly after their long tramp from the railroad at Hardeeville.\r\n\r\n\"The best way to get acquainted with a joggling board,\" said Ned,\r\napproaching a queer-looking structure on the piazza, \"is to get on it.\r\nTry it and see, Charley. Don't be afraid. It won't turn over, and it\r\ncan't break down. There,\" as Charley seated himself upon the board, \"lie\r\ndown now, and move almost any muscle you please the least bit in the\r\nworld, and you'll understand what the thing is for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! isn't it jolly!\" exclaimed Charley, as the board began to sway\r\ngently under him and the breeze from the sea fanned him.\r\n\r\n\"It is all of that,\" replied Ned. \"I'll get some pillows as soon as I\r\nget Jack to risk his precious neck on a board, and then we'll all be\r\ncomfortable, like clams at high-tide. Jump up, Jack; it won't tip over.\r\nNow swing your legs up and lie down. There, how's that?\"\r\n\r\nJack gave a sigh of satisfaction, while Ned ran into the house for sofa\r\npillows. The three boys, tired as they were, soon ceased to talk, and\r\nfell asleep to the gentle swaying of the joggling boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAFLOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce asleep on the cool, breeze-swept piazza, the three tired boys were\r\nnot inclined to wake easily. The sun went down, but still they slept.\r\nFinally the teamster from Hardeeville arrived with the trunks on an\r\nox-cart, and his loud cries to his oxen aroused Charley, who sprang up\r\nsuddenly. Forgetting that his couch was a joggling board more than three\r\nfeet high he undertook to step upon the floor as if he had been sleeping\r\non an ordinary sofa. The result was that his feet, failing to reach the\r\nfloor at the expected distance, were thrown backward under the board by\r\nthe forward motion of the upper part of the body, and Master Charles\r\nBlack, of Aiken, fell sprawling on the floor, waking both the other boys\r\nin alarm.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" cried Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. I'm down,\" replied Charley. \"I thought you said the thing\r\nwouldn't turn over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it hasn't,\" said Ned. \"Look and see. It's you that turned over.\r\nAre you hurt, old fellow?\"\r\n\r\nCharley was by this time on his feet again, and declared himself wholly\r\nfree from hurt of any kind. The trunks were brought in, the driver\r\nturned over to Maum Sally's hospitality, and Ned declared it to be time\r\nfor bed.\r\n\r\n\"Whew! how cold it is!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Do you have such changes of\r\nweather often, down here on the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only twice in twenty-four hours at this season,\" answered Ned, as they\r\nwent into the house.\r\n\r\n\"Twice in twenty-four hours! What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean once in twelve hours,\" answered Ned.\r\n\r\n\"How is that? I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see our late summer dews have begun to fall. If you were to\r\ngo out now, you would find the water actually dripping from the trees.\r\nFrom this time on it will be chilly at night, almost cold, in fact, but\r\nhot as the tropic of Cancer in the daytime. So we have a sudden change\r\nof temperature twice a day--once from cold to hot, and once from hot to\r\ncold.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys were too sleepy to talk long, and the sun was shining in at the\r\neast windows when Maum Sally waked them the next morning for a breakfast\r\nas miscellaneous as the supper had been; sliced tomatoes and figs, still\r\nwet with the dew, being prominent features of the meal.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Ned looked up a great variety of fishing tackle and got\r\nit in order.\r\n\r\n\"Where are your fish poles?\" asked one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Fish poles! we don't use them in salt water. We fish with tight lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, long lines with a sinker at the end and no poles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you just hold the line in your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And another thing that we don't use is a float. We just fish\r\nright down in the deep water--or the shallow water rather, for the best\r\nfishing is on bars where the water isn't more than twenty feet deep; but\r\ndeep or shallow, the fish are at the bottom, except skip-jacks; they\r\nswim on top, and sometimes we troll for them. They call them blue fish\r\nup North, I believe, but we call them skip-jacks or jack mackerel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Jack, as Ned spread out a round net for inspection.\r\n\r\n\"A cast net.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shrimps.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought we were going fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we are. But we must go shrimping first. We must have some bait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we are to use shrimps for bait, are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so indeed,\" answered Ned. \"They are capital bait--the best we\r\nhave, unless we want to catch sheephead; then we use fiddlers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are fiddlers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little black crabs that run about by millions over the sand. They have\r\nhard shells that whiting and croakers can't crack, while the sheephead,\r\nhaving good teeth, crush them easily. So when we want to catch\r\nsheephead, and don't want to be bothered with other fish, we bait with\r\nfiddlers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I understand that fish are so plentiful here and so easily caught\r\nthat they bother you when you want to catch particular kinds?\" said\r\nJack, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean that for a question,\" answered Ned, \"I'll let you answer it\r\nfor yourself after you've had a little experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we don't get any shrimps,\" said Charley, \"we'll fish for\r\nsheephead with musicians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musicians? oh, you mean fiddlers,\" said Ned. \"But we'll get shrimps\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they bother you, too, with their abundance?\" asked Jack, still\r\ninclined to joke his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Come on and see,\" said Ned, who had now prepared himself for wading.\r\n\r\nTaking the cast net in his hand, and giving a pail to Jack, he led the\r\nway to the sea. Wading into the mouth of a little inlet he cast the net,\r\nwhich was simply a circular piece of netting, with a string of leaden\r\nballs around the edge. From this lead line cords extended on the under\r\nside of the net to and through a ring in the centre where they were\r\nfastened to a long cord which was held in Ned's hand. A peculiar motion\r\nin casting caused the net to spread itself out flat and to fall in that\r\nway on the water. The leaden balls caused it to sink at once to the\r\nbottom, the edges reaching bottom first, of course, and imprisoning\r\nwhatever happened to be under the net in its passage. After a moment's\r\npause, to give time for the lead line to sink completely, Ned jerked the\r\ncord and began to draw in. Of course this drew the lead line along the\r\nbottom to the centre ring, and made a complete pocket of the net,\r\nsecurely holding whatever was caught in it.\r\n\r\nIt came up after this first cast with about a hundred shrimps--of the\r\nlarge kind called prawn in the North--in it. The boys opened their eyes\r\nin surprise, and Ned cast again, bringing up this time about twice as\r\nmany as before.\r\n\r\n\"They have hardly begun to come in yet,\" said Ned. \"The tide is too\r\nyoung.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly begun to come in?\" said Jack, \"why, the water's alive with them.\r\nLet me throw the net.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Ned, \"if you know how.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know how? Why, there's no knack in that; anybody can do it.\"\r\n\r\nWith this confident boast Jack took the net and gave a violent cast.\r\nNeglecting to relax the rope at the right moment, however, the confident\r\nyoung gentleman made trouble for himself. The lead line swung around\r\nrapidly, the net wrapped itself around Jack, and the leaden balls struck\r\nhim with sufficient violence to hurt. He lost his balance at the same\r\ninstant, and, his legs being held close together by the wet net, he\r\ncould not step out to recover himself. The result was that he fell\r\nsprawling into the water and was fished out in a very wet condition by\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\nJack was a boy capable of seeing the fun even in an accident of which he\r\nwas the victim. He stood still while the net was unwound, and for a\r\nmoment afterward. Then, seeing that the other boys were too considerate\r\nto laugh at him while in trouble, he quietly said:\r\n\r\n\"I told you I could do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you caught more in the net than I did,\" said Ned. \"Now take hold\r\nagain and I'll show you how to manage it. Your wet clothes won't hurt\r\nyou. Sea-water doesn't give one cold.\"\r\n\r\nA few lessons made Jack fairly expert in casting, but Charley had no\r\nmind to court mishaps, and would not try his skill. The pail was soon\r\nwell filled with shrimps, and the boys returned to the boat house,\r\nwhere Jack changed his wet clothes for dry ones.\r\n\r\nThen all haste was made to get the boat out, in order that they might\r\nfish while the tide was right. The boat was a large launch named _Red\r\nBird_; a boat twenty-four feet long, very broad in the beam, and very\r\nstoutly built. It was provided with a mast and sail, but these were of\r\nno use now as there was no wind, and the bars on which Ned meant to fish\r\nwere only a few hundred yards distant.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the anchor cast than the lines were out, and the fish\r\nbegan accepting the polite invitation extended to them.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of fish are these, Ned?\" asked Charley, as he took one from\r\nhis hook.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Ned, looking round, \"is a whiting--so called, I believe,\r\nbecause it is brown, and yellow, and occasionally pink and purple, with\r\nchangeable silk stripes over it. That's the only reason I can think of\r\nfor calling it a whiting. It is never white. It isn't properly a whiting\r\nfor that matter. It isn't at all the same as the whiting of the North,\r\nat any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they're changing color,\" exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Look! they actually change color under your very eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a way whiting have,\" said Ned. \"And some other fish do the\r\nsame thing, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dolphins do,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the whiting isn't even a second cousin to the dolphin. That's\r\na croaker you've got, Jack; spot on his tail--splendid fish to eat--and\r\nhe croaks. Listen!\"\r\n\r\nThe fish did begin to utter a curious croaking sound, which surprised\r\nthe boys. Other croakers were soon in the boat, and the company of them\r\nset up a croaking of which the inhabitants of a frog pond might not have\r\nbeen ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"They call croakers 'spot' in Virginia,\" said Ned, \"because of the spot\r\nnear the tail. Look at it. Isn't it pretty? and isn't the fish itself a\r\nbeauty?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the whiting is prettier,\" said Charley; \"at least in colors. I say,\r\nNed, do you know if whiting ever dine on kaleidoscopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out! hold that fellow away from you! hold the line at arm's length\r\nand don't let the brute strike you with his tail for your life!\"\r\nexclaimed Ned, excitedly, as Charley drew a curious-looking creature\r\nup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LOOK OUT! HOLD THAT FELLOW AWAY FROM YOU!\"]\r\n\r\n\"What is the thing?\" asked both the up-country boys in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"A stingaree,\" replied Ned, \"and as ugly as a rattlesnake. See how\r\nviciously he strikes with his tail! Let him down slowly till his tail\r\ntouches the bottom of the boat. There! Now wait till he stops striking\r\nfor a moment and then clap your foot on his tail. Ah! now you've got\r\nhim. Now cut the tail off close to the body and the fellow's harmless.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the creature anyhow?\" asked Jack, who had suspended his fishing\r\noperations to observe the monster. \"What did you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the gentleman belongs to a large and distinguished family. To\r\nspeak broadly, he is a plagiostrome chondropterygian, of the sub-order\r\n_raiiæ_, commonly called skates. To define him more particularly, he is\r\na member of the trygonidæ family, familiarly known as sting rays, and\r\ncalled by negroes and fishermen, and nearly every body else on the\r\ncoast, stingarees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth did you get that jargon from?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't jargon, and I got it from my uncle. He told me one day not to\r\ncall these things stingarees, but sting rays, and then for fun rattled\r\noff a lot of scientific talk at me, which I made him repeat until I knew\r\nit by heart. What I know about sting rays is this: there are a good many\r\nkinds of them in different quarters of the world. In the North they have\r\nthe American sting ray, which is much larger than ours down here, though\r\nwe sometimes catch them two or three feet wide. Ours is the European\r\nsting ray, I believe; at any rate, it isn't the American. They are all\r\nof them closely alike. They are brown on top and white beneath. You see\r\nthe shape--not unlike that of a turtle, but with something like wings at\r\nthe sides, and with a skin instead of a shell, and no legs. The most\r\ninteresting things about them are their long, slender tails. See,\"\r\npicking up the amputated tail and turning it over; \"see the gentleman's\r\nweapons. Those bony spikes, with their barbed sides, make very ugly\r\nwounds whenever the sting ray gets a good shot at a leg or an arm. The\r\nnegroes say the barbs are poisonous, like a rattlesnake's fangs; but the\r\nscientific folk dispute that. However that may be, a man was laid up for\r\nthree months right here in Bluffton, during the war, with a foot so bad\r\nthat the surgeons thought they would have to cut it off, and all from a\r\nvery slight wound by a sting-ray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" cried Jack. \"It isn't necessary to suppose poison; to have one of\r\nthose horrible bones driven into your flesh and then drawn out with the\r\nnotches all turned the wrong way, is enough to make any amount of\r\ntrouble, without adding poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that accounts for the stories told of the Indians shooting\r\npoisoned arrows,\" said Ned. \"They used sting-ray stings for arrow-heads\r\nat any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very capital arrow-heads they would make,\" said Charley, examining\r\nthe spikes, which were about the size of a large lead-pencil, about\r\nthree or four inches long, and barbed all along the sides, so that they\r\nlooked not unlike rye beards under a microscope. These spikes are placed\r\nnot at the end of the tail, but near the middle.\r\n\r\n\"Are sting rays good to eat?\" asked Jack, examining the slimy, flabby\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n\"It all depends upon the taste of the eater,\" replied Ned. \"The negroes\r\nsometimes eat the flaps or wings, and most white people on the coast\r\nhave curiosity enough to taste them. They always say there's nothing\r\nbad about the taste, but I never knew anybody to take to sting rays as a\r\ndelicacy. Some people say that alligator steaks are good, and a good\r\nmany people eat sharks now and then. For my part good fish are too\r\nplentiful here for me to experiment with bad ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe fishing was resumed now, and it was not long before Jack confessed\r\nthat the fish were beginning to \"bother\" him by their abundance and\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Ned,\" he said, \"I apologize. If you've any fiddlers about your clothes,\r\nI believe I'll confine my attention to sheephead; I'm tired of pulling\r\nfish in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's go ashore, then,\" said Ned, laughing, \"and have dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do fish bite in that way generally down here?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when the tide isn't too full. Fishing really gets to be a bore\r\nhere, it is so easy to fill a boat; anybody can do that as easily as\r\nthrow a cast net.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now hush that,\" said Charley. \"Jack has owned up and apologized, and\r\nagreed that he knows more than he did this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPLANS AND PREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the boys lolled upon the piazza, and Ned answered his\r\ncompanions' questions concerning Bluffton and region round about.\r\n\r\n\"The water here is called South May River,\" he said, \"but why, I don't\r\nknow. It certainly isn't a river. This whole coast is a ragged edge of\r\nland with all sorts of inlets running up into it, and with islands, big\r\nand little, dotted about off the mainland. Yonder is Hilton Head away\r\nover near the horizon. Hunting Island lies off to the left, and Bear's\r\nIsland further away yet. The little marsh islands have no names. They\r\nare simply bars of mud on which a kind of rank grass, called salt marsh,\r\ngrows. Some of them are covered by every tide; others only by\r\nspring-tides, while others are covered by all except neap-tides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any land over that way, to the right of Hilton Head?\" Charley\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Good idea!\" exclaimed Ned. \"I say, let's go buffalo-hunting and\r\ncrusoeing and yachting all at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of answer is that nonsense to my question?\" asked Charley,\r\nwith mock dignity and real doubt as to his friend's meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I jumped a little, that's all,\" said Ned. \"Your question\r\nsuggested my answer. Bee Island lies over there, out of sight. It's my\r\nuncle's land. It used to be a sea-island plantation, but was abandoned\r\nduring the war and has never been occupied since. It has grown up and is\r\nas wild as if it had never been cultivated at all. The cattle were left\r\non it when the place was abandoned, and they went completely wild.\r\nDuring the war parties of soldiers from both sides used to go over there\r\nto hunt the wild cattle. Sometimes they met each other and hunted each\r\nother instead of the cattle. Now it just occurred to me that we might\r\nhave jolly fun by fitting out an expedition, sailing over there in the\r\n_Red Bird_--you see these land-locked waters are never very rough or\r\ndangerous--and camping there as long as we like. When we are in the\r\nboat, we will be yachtsmen of the 'swellest' sort; when we're on the\r\ndesert island--or deserted, rather, for it is desert only in the past\r\ntense--we'll be Robinson Crusoes; and when we want beef we'll kill a\r\nwild cow, if there are any left, and be buffalo hunters, for what's a\r\nbuffalo but a sort of wild cow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the fishing good over there?\" asked Jack, \"for I'm not so much\r\nbothered by the fish yet that I want to quit catching them.\"\r\n\r\n\"As good as here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, let's go,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"So say I,\" responded Charley. \"When shall we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning. It will take all this afternoon to get ready,\" said\r\nNed.\r\n\r\nWith that they set to work collecting necessary materials.\r\n\r\n\"We must have all sorts of things,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jack, \"particularly in our characters as Robinson\r\nCrusoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" asked Charley. \"He had nothing. He was shipwrecked, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know. But did you never notice what extraordinary luck he had?\r\nAbsolutely every thing that was indispensable to him came ashore or was\r\nbrought ashore from that accommodating wreck. Why, he even got gunpowder\r\nenough to last him, and whatever the ship didn't yield the island did. I\r\nalways suspected that Robinson Crusoe loaded that ship himself with\r\nspecial reference to his needs on the island, and picked out the right\r\nisland, and then ran the ship on the rocks purposely.\"\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of Robinson Crusoe's character and life was a novel\r\none to Jack's companions; but their plan for their expedition did not\r\ninclude any purpose to deny themselves needed conveniences.\r\n\r\nThe large duck gun was taken down from its hooks in the hall, and a good\r\nsupply of ammunition was put into the shot pouches and powder flask.\r\nThis included one pouch of buckshot and one of smaller shot for fowls.\r\nThe fishing tackle was already in the boat house, as we know. An axe, a\r\nhatchet, a piece of bacon, to be used in frying fish, a small bag of\r\nrice, another of flour, and another of sweet potatoes, a box of salt,\r\nanother of sugar--both water-tight,--and some coffee, completed the list\r\nof stores as planned by the boys. Maum Sally contemplated the\r\ncollection, after the boys had declared it to be complete, and\r\nexclaimed;\r\n\r\n\"Well, I 'clar now!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Maum Sally?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin', on'y it's jis zacly like a passel o' boys, dat is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is?\"\r\n\r\n\"W'y wot for is you a takin' things to eat?\" asked Sally.\r\n\r\n\"Because we'll want to eat them,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Raw?\" asked Sally.\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Ned, with a look of confusion. \"Boys, we haven't put\r\nin a single cooking utensil!\"\r\n\r\nLaughing at their blunder, the boys set about choosing from Maum Sally's\r\nstores what they thought was most imperatively needed. Two skillets, one\r\nto be used for frying and the other for baking bread; a kettle, to be\r\nused in boiling rice, in heating water for coffee, and as a bread pan in\r\nwhich to mix corn bread; a coffee pot; some tin cups; three forks and\r\nthree plates, constituted their outfit.\r\n\r\nEach boy had his pocket knife, of course, and Ned had put into the boat\r\na large hunting knife from the house.\r\n\r\nWhen all was stored ready for the morning's departure, the boys ate\r\ntheir supper and betook themselves to the piazza.\r\n\r\n\"I hope there'll be a fair breeze in the morning,\" said Ned, \"for it\r\nwill be a frightful job to row that big boat to Bee Island if there\r\nisn't wind enough to sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"About a dozen miles. But there is nearly always, breeze enough to sail,\r\nafter we get away from the bluffs here; but the tide will be against\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Why it will begin running up about eight o'clock to-morrow, and of\r\ncourse it won't turn till about two.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it will begin running up about eight o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, because it began running up a little after seven this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what has that got to do with it? Don't it all depend on the\r\nwind?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a landlubber you are!\" exclaimed Ned. \"No, it don't depend on the\r\nwind. It depends on the moon and the sun. I'll try to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, don't,\" said Jack; \"let him read about it in his geography, or\r\nexplain it to him some other time. Tell us about something else now.\r\nIsn't the country fever likely to bother us over there on the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not if we select a good place to camp in. We must get on pretty\r\nhigh ground near the salt water. I know the look of healthy and\r\nunhealthy places pretty well, and we'll be safe enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. When we get into camp you can deliver that lecture on tides\r\nif you want to, but just now we wouldn't attend to it. We're apt to be a\r\ntrifle cross in the evenings over there if we get tired. Tired people in\r\ncamp are always cross, and it will be just as well to save whatever you\r\nhave to say till we need something to talk about. Then you can tell us\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I've something interesting to tell you without waiting,\"\r\nsaid Ned; \"something very interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That it is after nine o'clock; that we want to get up early; and that\r\nwe'd better go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said his companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SAILING OF THE \"RED BIRD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys were out of bed not long after daylight the next morning. The\r\nsky was clear, but there was not a particle of breeze, and even before\r\nthe sun rose the air was hot and stifling to a degree never before\r\nexperienced by either of Ned's visitors.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Ned, this is a frightful morning,\" said Jack. \"I feel myself\r\nmelting as I stand here in my clothes. I'm already as weak as a pound of\r\nbutter looks in the sun. How we're going to breathe when the sun comes\r\nup, I'm at a loss to determine. Whew!\" and with that Jack sat down\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\"A nice time we'll have rowing,\" said Charley. \"I move we swim and push\r\nthe boat. It'll be cooler, and not much harder work. Does it ever rain\r\nhere? because if it does I'm waiting for a shower. I'm wilted down, and\r\nnothing short of a drenching will revive me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ned, \"come, let's take a drenching. I'm going to take a\r\nheader off the boat-house pier. It's low-water now, and there's a clear\r\njump of ten feet. A plunge will wake us up, and by that time breakfast\r\nwill be ready, and what is more to the point, the tide will turn. That's\r\na comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Because when it turns a sea-breeze will come with it. This sort of heat\r\nis what we'd have here all summer long if it wasn't for land- and\r\nsea-breezes. As it is we never have it except at dead low water, and it\r\nis always followed by a good stiff sea-breeze when the tide turns. We'll\r\nbe able to sail instead of swimming over to the island. But come, let's\r\nhave our plunge now.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the boys went to the boat house to bestow their freight\r\nin the boat. The tide had turned, and, as Ned had predicted, a cool,\r\nstimulating breeze had begun to blow, so that the strength returned to\r\nJack's knees and Charley's resolution.\r\n\r\n\"It will be best to fill the boat's water kegs,\" said Ned; \"partly\r\nbecause we'll want water on the way, partly because we'll want water on\r\nthe island, while we're digging for a permanent supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Jack, \"what are we going to dig with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's another blunder,\" said Ned. \"If Robinson Crusoe had\r\nforgotten things in that way, he never would have lived through his\r\nisland experiences. We must have a shovel and a pick. I'll run up to the\r\nhouse and look for them while you boys fill the water kegs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ned got back to the boat he was confronted by Maum Sally with a big\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Maum Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh nothin', on'y I spose you young gentlemen is a gwine to sleep jes a\r\nlittle now an' then o' nights, an' so, as you hasn't thought on it\r\nyerse'fs, I's done brung you some bedclo'es.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now look here, boys,\" said Ned; \"we'll go off without our heads yet.\r\nWe've lost our heads several times already, in fact. There's nothing for\r\nit except just to imagine ourselves at the island, and run through a\r\nwhole day and night in our minds to see what we're going to need.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Charley. \"I'll begin. I'll need my mother\r\nthe first thing, because here's a button off my collar.\"\r\n\r\nThe party laughed, of course, but there was force in the suggestion. A\r\nfew buttons, a needle or two, and some stout thread were straightway\r\nadded to the ship's stores.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's see,\" said Ned. \"We'll need to build a shelter first thing,\r\nand we've all the tools necessary for that, because I've thought it out\r\ncarefully. Then we have our digging tools. Very well. Now, for breakfast\r\nwe need, let me see,\" and he ran over the materials and utensils already\r\nenumerated. Going on in this way through an imaginary day on the island,\r\nthe boys found their list of stores now reasonably complete. From Maum\r\nSally's bundle they selected three blankets, which they rolled up tight\r\nand bestowed behind the water keg at the stern. Maum Sally had brought\r\npillows, sheets, and a large mattress, which she earnestly besought them\r\nto take, but they declined to add to their cargo any thing which could\r\nbe dispensed with. At the very last moment one of the boys thought of\r\nmatches. It was decided that three small boxes would be sufficient, as\r\nthey could keep fire by the exercise of a little caution.\r\n\r\nThus equipped, they bade Maum Sally good-by, and cast the boat loose.\r\nThe sail filled, the _Red Bird_ lay a little over upon one side, with\r\nthe wind nearly abeam, and the boys settled themselves into their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\"I say, young Ned,\" called Maum Sally, \"how long's ye mean to be gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. May be a month,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not a day longer 'n dat, now mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nODD FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea-breeze was fresh and full, and it blew from a favorable quarter.\r\nThere were various windings about among the small islands to be made,\r\nand now and then the course for a brief distance was against the wind,\r\nand as this was the case only where the channel was narrow, it was\r\nnecessary to make a series of very short \"tacks,\" which gave Ned an\r\nopportunity to instruct his companions in the art of sailing a boat. In\r\nthe main, however, there was an abundance of sea-room, and Ned could lay\r\nhis course directly for Bee Island and keep the wind on the quarter. It\r\nwas barely eleven o'clock, therefore, when the _Red Bird_ came to her\r\nmoorings on the island, and the boys went ashore.\r\n\r\n\"Now the first thing that Robinson Crusoe did after he got his wits\r\nabout him,\" said Jack, \"was to build his residence. Let's follow the\r\nexample of that experienced mariner, and choose our building-site before\r\nwe begin to bring away things from the wreck; I mean, before we unload\r\nour plunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's our best plan,\" said Ned. \"We don't want to do any more\r\ncarrying than we must. Let me see. We're on the north side of the\r\nisland. If I remember right, the negro quarters used to be to the east\r\nof this spot, and the negroes must have got water from somewhere, so\r\nwe'd better look for the ruins of that African Troy, in search of the\r\nancient reservoirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far from the shore were the quarters?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember, if I ever knew; but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems to me this island has grown up somewhat as the hair on\r\nyour head does, in a shock. The large trees, as nearly as I can make\r\nout, think six feet or so to be a proper interval between themselves,\r\nand the small trees have disposed themselves to the best of their\r\nability between the big ones; then all kinds of vines have grown up\r\namong the big and little trees, as if to make a sort of shrimp-net of\r\nthe woods, and cane has grown up just to occupy any vacant spaces that\r\nmight be left. It occurs to me that if we're to hunt anywhere except\r\nalong shore for the old quarters, we'd best make up our minds to clear\r\nthe island as we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Charley,\" said Jack, \"if you were obliged to clear an acre of\r\nthis growth with your own hands what would you do first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd get a good axe, a grubbing hoe, some matches, and kindling wood;\r\nthen I'd take a good look at the thicket; and then I'd take a long, long\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose you'd need it. But that isn't what I meant. Never mind\r\nthat, however. Ned, I don't see why this isn't as good a place as any\r\nfor our camp. There's a sort of bluff here, and we can clear away a\r\nplace for our hut and get the hut built with less labor than it would\r\ntake to find traces of negro quarters that were destroyed twelve or\r\nfifteen years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how about water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't think it likely that we'd find any visible remains of a\r\nwell in the other place, and if we did we'd have to dig it all out\r\nagain. Why not dig here?\"\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, and the examination of the shore for a short\r\ndistance in each direction, this suggestion was adopted. The building of\r\na shelter was easy work. It was necessary only to erect a framework of\r\npoles, to cut bushes and place them against the sides for walls, and to\r\ncover the whole with palmete leaves--that is to say, with the leaves of\r\na species of dwarf palm which grows in that region in abundance. These\r\nleaves are known to persons at the North only in the form of palm-leaf\r\nfans. On the coast of South Carolina they grow in all the swamps and\r\nwoodlands.\r\n\r\nA little labor made a bunk for the boys to sleep upon, and while Ned and\r\nCharley filled it with long gray Spanish moss, Jack got dinner ready,\r\nfirst rowing out from shore and catching fish enough for that meal while\r\nhis companions finished the house.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jack, when dinner was over and the boys had stretched\r\nthemselves out for a rest, \"it's nearly sunset, and we're all tired.\r\nWe've got the best part of two kegs of water left, so I move that we\r\ndon't begin digging our well till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said the other boys, glad enough to be idle.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I've got something I want you to tell me about,\" said Jack. \"Two\r\nthings, in fact.\" With that, he went to the boat and looked about.\r\nPresently he came back and said:\r\n\r\n\"One of 'em's dried up. Here's the other.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed Ned a queer-looking fish, almost black, about eight inches\r\nlong, very slender, and very singularly shaped.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" he said; \"its jaw protrudes in so queer a way that I can't make\r\nout which side of the creature is top and which bottom. Turn either side\r\nyou please up, and it looks as if you ought to turn the other up\r\ninstead; and then the thing has a sort of match-lighter on top of his\r\nhead, or on the bottom--I don't know which it is. Look.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the creature's head. There was a flat, oval figure there,\r\nmade by a ridge in the skin, and the flat space enclosed within this\r\noval line was crossed diagonally by other ridges, arranged with perfect\r\nregularity. The whole looked something like the figure on the opposite\r\npage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Now, what I want to know,\" said Jack, \"is what sort of fish this is,\r\nwhich side of him belongs on top, and what use he makes of this\r\nmatch-lighter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't help you much,\" said Ned. \"A year ago I would have\r\ntold you at once that the fish is a shark's pilot, so called because he\r\nfollows ships as sharks do, and the sailors think he acts as a pilot for\r\nthe sharks. But now I don't know what to call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't know. I've been reading up in the cyclopædias and\r\nnatural histories and ichthyologies about our fishes down here, and have\r\nfound out that whatever I know isn't so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take the whiting, for example. When I began reading up to see if\r\nthere was any sort of cousinship between him and the dolphin, I soon\r\nfound that the whiting isn't a whiting at all, but I couldn't find out\r\nany thing else about him. The whiting described in the books is a sort\r\nof codfish's cousin, and he lives only at the North. Neither the\r\npictures nor the descriptions of him at all resemble our whiting, so I\r\ndon't know what sort of fish our whiting is. I only know that he isn't a\r\nwhiting, and isn't the remotest relation to the dolphin, because he is a\r\nfish and has scales, while the dolphin is a cetacean.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a cetacean?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"A vertebrated, mammiferous marine animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; go on; English all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, whales, dolphins narwhals, and porpoises are the principal\r\ncetaceans. They are not fish, but marine animals, and they suckle their\r\nyoung.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's news to me,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Jack, \"if you two have finished your little side\r\ndiscussion, suppose we come back to the subject in hand. What do you\r\nknow, Ned, about this fish that I have in my hand, and why don't you\r\ncall him a shark's pilot now, as you say you did a year ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, because the books treat me the same way in his case that they do\r\nin the whiting's. They describe a shark's pilot which is as different\r\nfrom this as a whale is from a heifer calf, and so I don't know what to\r\ncall this fellow. Did he make a fight when you caught him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed he did. I was sure I had a twenty-pound something or other on my\r\nhook, and when I pulled up this insignificant little creature, with the\r\nmatch box on his head, I was disgusted. I looked at him to see if he\r\nhadn't a steam-engine somewhere about him, because he pulled so hard,\r\nand that's what made me observe his match box and his curious\r\nup-side-down-itiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Ned,\" said Charley, \"why is it that our Southern fishes are so\r\nneglected in the books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've asked myself that question, and the only answer I can think\r\nof is this: in the first place, there is no great commercial interest in\r\nfishing here as there is at the North; and then the natural history\r\nbooks and the cyclopædias are all written at the North or in Europe, and\r\nso there are thousands of curious fish down here which are not\r\nmentioned. There's the pin-cushion fish, for example. I can't find a\r\ntrace of that curious creature in any of the books.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of thing is a pin-cushion fish?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"He's simply a hollow sphere, a globular bag about twice the size of a\r\nwalnut, and as round as a base ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half transparent, is he? Red, shaded off into white? with water inside\r\nof him, and pimples, like pin-heads, all over him, and eyes and mouth\r\nright on his fair rotundity, making him look like a picture of the full\r\nmoon made into a human face?\" asked Jack eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the pin-cushion fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. That's my other one,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's the other thing I had to show you, but couldn't find. I\r\ncaught him with the cast net.\"\r\n\r\n\"And kept him to show to me?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did. He spat himself away.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if you take a pin-cushion fish out of the water, and put him down\r\non a board, he'll sit there looking like a judge for a little while;\r\nthen he'll begin to spit, and when he spits all the water out, there's\r\nnothing left of him except a small lump of jelly. They're very curious\r\nthings. I wish we had a good popular book about our Southern fishes and\r\nthe curious things that live in the water here on the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you suppose these things are represented at all in scientific\r\nbooks?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that many of them are, but many of them are not, and those\r\nthat are described, are described by names that we know nothing about,\r\nand so only a naturalist could find the descriptions or recognize them\r\nwhen found. With all Northern fishes that are familiarly known, the case\r\nis different. If a Northern boy wants to find out more than he knows\r\nalready about a codfish, he looks for the information under the familiar\r\nname 'Codfish,' and finds it there. He does not need to know in advance\r\nthat the cod is a fish of the _Gadus_ family, and the _Morrhua vulgaris_\r\nspecies. So, when he wants to know about the whiting that he is familiar\r\nwith, he finds the information under the name whiting; but the\r\nscientific men who wrote the books, however much they may know about the\r\nfish that we call whiting, do not know, I suppose, that it is anywhere\r\ncalled whiting, and so they don't put the information about it under\r\nthat head. They only come down South as far as New Jersey, and tell\r\nabout a species of fish which is there called whiting, though it isn't\r\nthe real whiting. If they had known that still another and a very\r\ndifferent fish goes by that name down here, they would have told us\r\nabout that too, in the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the remedy?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"For you, or Jack, or me,\" answered Ned, \"to study science, and to make\r\na specialty of our Southern fishes. When we do that and give the world\r\nall the information we can get by really intelligent observation, all\r\nthe scientific writers will welcome the addition made to the general\r\nstore of knowledge. That is the way it has all been found out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we begin now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we haven't learned how to observe. We don't know enough of\r\ngeneral principles to be able to understand what we see. Let's form\r\nhabits of observation, and let's study science systematically; after\r\nthat we can observe intelligently, and make a real contribution to\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to write your book on the Marine Fauna of the Southern\r\nStates to-night, are you?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Ned, with a laugh at his own enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's go to bed; I'm sleepy,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAN ENEMY IN THE CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three tired boys went to sleep easily enough, and the snoring inside\r\ntheir hut gave fair promise of a late waking the next day. But before\r\nlong Jack became restless in his sleep, and began to toss about a good\r\ndeal. Charley seemed to catch his restlessness, and presently he sat up\r\nin the bunk and began to slap himself. This thoroughly aroused him, and\r\nas Jack and Ned were tossing about uneasily he had no scruple in\r\nspeaking to them.\r\n\r\n\"I say, fellows, we're attacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" muttered Ned, at the same time beginning to rub\r\nhimself vigorously, first on one part of the body, then on another.\r\n\r\n\"Mosquitoes,\" said Jack, violently rubbing his scalp.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than mosquitoes,\" said Charley; \"they feel more like yellow\r\njackets or hornets, I should say; and they're inside our clothes too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Ned, leaping out of the bunk, \"I didn't think of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked both the other boys in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"A swarm of sand-flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sand-flies! what are they?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, and I'll show you,\" replied Ned, going out and stirring up the\r\nfire so as to make a light. Meantime the boys rubbed and writhed and\r\nturned themselves about in something like agony, for, though they\r\nsuffered no severe pain at any one spot, their whole bodies seemed to be\r\ncovered with red pepper. Every inch of their skins was inflamed, and the\r\nmore they rubbed the worse the irritation became.\r\n\r\nWhen Ned had made a bright light, he showed his companions what their\r\ntormentors were. Jack and Charley saw some very minute flying\r\ninsects--true flies indeed--not much larger than the points of pins.\r\nThere were millions of the creatures. The whole air seemed full of them\r\nindeed, and wherever one rested for a moment upon the skin of its\r\nvictim, there was at once a pricking sensation, followed by the\r\nintolerable burning and irritation already mentioned.\r\n\r\nCharley was at first incredulous. \"You don't mean to tell me,\" he said,\r\n\"that those little gnats have done all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered Ned, \"and more than that, I have known them to\r\nkill a horse, tormenting him to death in a few hours. They'll get under\r\na horse's hair by millions and literally cover him, until you can see\r\nthe hair move with them. But they are not gnats.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, see here, Ned,\" said Jack; \"when I barely touch one of the\r\ncreatures, it not only kills him but distributes him pretty evenly over\r\nthe surrounding surface. They haven't strength enough to hang together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied Ned; \"what of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how can such things bite so? and especially how can they force\r\ntheir way through our blankets and clothes? I should think they'd tear\r\nthemselves to pieces in the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"So should I, if I didn't know better; but as a matter of fact they do\r\nmanage to get through without dulling their teeth, as we have proof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the creatures teeth?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not; but they have a sort of rasping apparatus which is\r\njust as bad. They have an acrid kind of saliva too, which they put into\r\nthe wounds they make, and that is what smarts so. But come, this won't\r\ndo. We must make a good smudge.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a smudge?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you presently,\" answered Ned, while he began to build a small\r\nfire immediately in front of the tent. When it had burned a little, he\r\nsmothered it with damp leaves and moss, so that it gave off a dense\r\ncloud of smoke which quickly filled the hut.\r\n\r\n\"Now the tent will soon be clear of them,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Sand-flies object to smoke, I suppose,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Very much indeed,\" answered Ned, \"and it is customary here on the coast\r\nto have a pair of smudge boxes in front of every house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame them for objecting,\" grumbled Charley, coughing and\r\nwiping his smoke-inflamed eyes; \"I can't say that I find smoke the most\r\ndelightful atmosphere myself. But what is a 'smudge box,' Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply a shallow box of earth set upon a post, to build a smudge upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Ned,\" asked Jack, \"what do you mean by saying that sand-flies\r\naren't gnats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply that they aren't,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"What are they, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is a small fly but a gnat?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is a gnat but a small fly?\" added Charley.\r\n\r\n\"The two are not at all the same thing,\" answered Ned. \"That is a\r\npopular mistake. I have heard people say they could stand mosquitoes,\r\nbut couldn't endure gnats; and yet the mosquito is a gnat, and what\r\nthese people call gnats are not gnats at all, but simply small flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"What constitutes the exact difference?\"\r\n\r\n\"The shape of the body. All flies are two-winged insects, and gnats are\r\nflies in that sense, of course; but gnats are those flies that have long\r\nbodies behind their wings, to balance themselves with. Mosquitoes are\r\nour best example of them. These sand flies, you see, have very short\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but very long bills, I fancy,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jack, \"all that is news to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is. Most people think a whale is a fish, too, but for all\r\nthat it is nothing of the kind. What are you doing, Charley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tossing up heads or tails for it,\" answered Charley, who had left the\r\ntent and gone to the large fire.\r\n\r\n\"Tossing up for what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To determine the method and manner of my death,\" answered Charley, with\r\nprofound gravity. \"If I stay in the hut I shall die of suffocation in\r\nthe smoke, and if I stay out here the sand flies will kill me. I can't\r\nquite make up my mind which death I prefer, so I'm tossing up for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! there's a breeze,\" said Ned; \"if it rises it'll relieve you of\r\nthe necessity of choosing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? By blowing the smoke away, and so giving the sand flies a fair\r\nfield?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; by blowing the sand flies away; they can't stand much of a breeze.\r\nIt is coming up, too, and we shall get some sleep after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe breeze did indeed rise after a time, but the dawn was almost upon\r\nthem before the boys really slept again, so severely were their skins\r\nirritated by their small enemies.\r\n\r\nThey had learned a lesson, however, and during the rest of their stay on\r\nthe island they never neglected to make a smudge in front of the hut\r\nbefore attempting to sleep. It was not often that the sand flies\r\nappeared in such numbers as on this night, and hence it was not often\r\nnecessary to fill the tent too full of smoke for comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING AND END OF A VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first care of the boys the next morning was to dig their well. This\r\nwas a comparatively trifling task, as they had only to dig four or five\r\nfeet through soft alluvial soil and sand. Instead of making\r\nperpendicular sides to their well, they dug it out in the shape of a\r\nbowl, so that they could walk down to the water and dip it up as they\r\nneeded it.\r\n\r\nHaving a hut to live in and a well from which to get fresh water, they\r\nwere now free to begin the sport for which they had come to the island.\r\nThey went fishing first, of course, that being the obvious thing to do,\r\nbut after a few hours of this the tide became too full, and the fish\r\nceased to bite satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\"Let's crusoe a little,\" said Jack, winding up his line.\r\n\r\n\"In what particular way?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Why, let's sail around our domain and see how the island looks on its\r\nother sides. Perhaps we may discover the savages, or find some game.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea; but we must go back to camp first, to leave our fish and\r\nget the gun and the sail; and while we're there we'd better get some\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\nSo said, so done. Dinner was very hastily dispatched, as the boys were\r\nanxious to get off, in order that the circuit of the island might be\r\ncompleted before night.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like rain,\" said Ned, as he shook out the sail, \"but we don't\r\nmind a wetting.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a good breeze, and the boat bounded away, rocking a good deal,\r\nfor the wind had been blowing all day, and there was more sea on than\r\nwas usual in those quiet waters. Ned let the centre-board down, which\r\nsteadied the boat somewhat, and enabled her to carry her sail without\r\ndanger. The plan was to coast along about half a mile off shore in order\r\nthat the island might be seen to good advantage; but as the eastern\r\nshore was reached the sea became heavier, and the roar of the surf on\r\nshore warned Ned of broad sands upon that side.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to make more offing here,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that? turn it into English,\" said Charley Black,\r\nwho persistently refused to understand any thing that sounded like a\r\nnautical term.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I mean I've got to sail farther away from the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause why?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Because of two things,\" replied Ned. \"In the first place the sea comes\r\nin between those two islands over there, and has a fair sweep at about\r\nhalf a mile of our island's coast, and so for the next half mile we\r\nshall have some pretty rough water, and I prefer to be well off shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you'd prefer to be close inshore if there's danger. Then\r\nif any thing happens we can land.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all you know about it,\" said Ned. \"I don't think there's the\r\nleast danger, so long as we keep off shore, because this boat, with her\r\ncentre-board down, is seaworthy; but as she isn't beach-worthy--and no\r\nvessel is that--I don't want to get her upon a beach. That brings me to\r\nmy second reason. I want to take a good offing, because by the way the\r\nsurf roars here, and by the look of it, I judge that there's a long\r\nsandy beach running out from this part of the island, and I don't want\r\nto risk getting into too shallow water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why couldn't we land if there were danger?\" asked Jack Farnsworth.\r\n\"If I had the helm that would be the first thing I'd try to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"So should I if I had a harbor to run into,\" replied Ned. \"But don't you\r\nsee that if we ran upon a sandy beach when there was a sea on, we should\r\nsoon come to a place where there wouldn't be water enough except as a\r\nwave came in? Then the boat would be lifted up by every wave, and\r\nsuddenly dropped upon the hard sand, and I can tell you she wouldn't\r\nstand much of that. Did you never notice that nearly all shipwrecks\r\noccur along shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's true,\" replied Jack. \"Ships that come to grief nearly\r\nalways run on breakers or something; but I never thought of it before.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Ned had secured at least a mile of offing but the sea grew\r\nevery moment heavier. The wind had risen to half a gale, and in spite\r\nof the close reefing of the sail the boat lay far over and Ned directed\r\nhis companions to \"trim ship\" by sitting upon the gunwale.\r\n\r\nJack Farnsworth soon discovered that Ned was becoming anxious. He\r\nquietly said:\r\n\r\n\"You suspect danger, Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Ned, \"at least I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes you do. I see it in your face. Now I want to say at once that\r\nwhatever the danger is, we can only increase it by losing our wits. The\r\nimportant thing is for you to keep perfectly cool, because you know more\r\nthan we do about sailing. Then you can tell us what to do, if there's\r\nany thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Ned; \"the fact is this: I think by the look of the\r\nhorizon out there at sea, that we are likely to have a squall--that is,\r\na sudden and very violent blow, added to the steadier wind that blows\r\nnow. If we can run across this open space before it comes, we'll be all\r\nright under the lee of that island over there, and if no squall comes\r\nwe're safe enough even here, because the boat is seaworthy. But a\r\nknock-over squall might capsize us. It's coming, too--let go the\r\nsheet--cut it--any thing!\"\r\n\r\nAs he said, or rather shouted this, Ned tried to head the boat to the\r\nwind, while Jack and Charley let go the sheet, and thus set the sail\r\nfree. If the squall had struck the boat with the sheet fastened and the\r\nsail thus held in position, the _Red Bird_ would have capsized\r\ninstantly; but with the sail swinging freely, less resistance was\r\noffered, and Ned expected in this way to avoid a catastrophe. He headed\r\nthe boat to the wind, which was the best thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe squall struck just as the sail swung free, but before the _Red Bird_\r\ncould be brought completely around.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the boys that the boat had been struck violently by a solid\r\nball of some kind, so sharply did the squall come upon it. Having her\r\nhead almost to the wind, she reared like a horse, swung around, and very\r\nnearly rolled over, but she did not quite capsize. The mast, however,\r\nsnapped short off, and the sail fell over into the water, being held\r\nfast to the boat only by the guys.\r\n\r\n\"Cut the guys, Jack,\" cried Ned, \"or that sail will swamp us! There! now\r\nall sit down in the bottom of the boat; no, no, Charley, not on the\r\nthwart, but on the bottom!\"\r\n\r\nNed had to shriek these orders to be heard above the roar of the squall,\r\nwhich had not yet subsided. He knew that the immediate danger now was\r\nthat the boat might turn over, and to prevent this, he ordered his\r\ncompanions to sit upon the bottom, as he himself did, in order that\r\ntheir weight might be where it would best serve as ballast.\r\n\r\nThis brought the three very nearly together, so that they could speak to\r\neach other without shouting quite at the top of their voices.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ned?\" said Charley Black.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Ned, \"we shan't capsize now. That danger is over; but\r\nthere's another before us that is just as bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"And what shall we do toward meeting it?\" asked Jack, whose superb\r\ncalmness and manly resolution to look things in the face and to make\r\nfight against danger won Ned's heart.\r\n\r\n\"We're being driven at railroad speed upon the beach,\" answered Ned,\r\n\"and we'll strike pretty soon. We've already lost the oars, and we\r\ncouldn't use them if we had them in this sea; so we have nothing to do\r\nbut wait. When we strike, the boat will be mashed into kindling wood.\r\nEvery thing depends then upon where we strike. If it is far from shore\r\nthe big waves will beat us to a jelly on the sand. Our only chance will\r\nbe, as soon as the boat strikes, to catch the next wave, swimming with\r\nit toward shore, taking care, when it recedes, to light on our feet, and\r\nthen run with all our might up the sand. If we can get inside the break\r\nof the surf before the next wave catches us we're safe; but that's the\r\nonly chance. Every thing depends now on where we strike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boots off,\" cried Jack; \"we may have to swim.\"\r\n\r\nNed and Charley accepted the suggestion. All now anxiously scanned the\r\nshore, which seemed to be coming toward them at a tremendous speed.\r\nSuddenly Ned cried out:\r\n\r\n\"There's a reef just ahead; when we strike try to cross it into the\r\nstiller water.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment it seemed as if the sandy reef had suddenly shot up from\r\nbelow, striking the bottom of the boat as a trip-hammer might, and\r\nshivering it into fragments. What had really happened was this: the\r\nboat, driving forward on the crest of a wave, had been carried to a\r\npoint immediately over the sand ridge or reef, and there suddenly\r\ndropped by the receding of the wave. It had struck the sandy bottom with\r\nsufficient violence to crush its sides and bottom into a shapeless mass.\r\n\r\nThe boys were wellnigh stunned by the blow, but rallying quickly they\r\nran forward in water only a few inches deep, and before the next\r\nincoming wave struck, they had crossed the narrow sand reef, and plunged\r\ninto the deep, but comparatively still water that lay inside. The surf\r\nwas broken, of course, upon the reef, and although the waves passed\r\ncompletely over it, their force was expended upon it, so that inside the\r\nbarrier the boys found the water disturbed by nothing more than a swell.\r\nThe distance to the shore was small, and they soon swam it, pulling\r\nthemselves out on the sand, drenched, bare-headed, bootless, and weary\r\nbeyond expression, not so much from exertion as from the strain through\r\nwhich their brains and nerves had passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to rest. Utterly exhausted, the lads\r\ndragged themselves a few feet from the water and threw themselves down\r\nupon the sand, thinking of nothing and caring for nothing except to lie\r\nstill. The squall had passed away as quickly as it had come, and\r\nalthough a stiff breeze was still blowing the afternoon sun beating down\r\nupon them warmed as well as dried them rapidly. Jack Farnsworth was the\r\nfirst to recover his wits.\r\n\r\n\"I say, fellows, this won't do,\" he said, raising himself to a sitting\r\nposture. \"The day is waning and we've got to get back to our camp before\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nNed and Charley tried to rise. Ned accomplished the feat, but poor\r\nCharley found it impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Why, boys,\" he said, sinking back upon the sand, \"I'm all of a tremble;\r\nI don't know what's the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reaction,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, under all that excitement you kept your strength up by a\r\ntremendous effort, and now you're paying the bill you owe your nerves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm sure I didn't tremble when we were in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, because you wouldn't give way then. Your will was master. It\r\nordered your nerves to furnish strength enough to keep still, and\r\ncommanded your muscles to do what was necessary to get you safe ashore.\r\nThey obeyed, and now your will is in their debt. It took more than was\r\ndue, and your nerves and muscles have presented their bill. They are\r\nbullying your will in return for the bullying it gave them a little\r\nwhile ago. That's the way my father explained it to me once when I\r\ntrembled after a big scare. Only lie still awhile and you'll come round.\r\nI was as weak as water five minutes ago, but I'm getting my strength\r\nback again now.\"\r\n\r\n\"'As weak as water,'\" said Jack Farnsworth meditatively. \"I used to\r\nthink that a good comparison, but I've altered my opinion. Water is the\r\nstrongest thing I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Why, think how it picked the _Red Bird_ up and flung her down on the\r\nsand like an angry giant--but with ten thousand times a giant's\r\nstrength! And it picks great ships up in the same way and dashes them to\r\npieces as I might do with an egg-shell or a China cup. Water is a giant,\r\na demon of angry strength. I shall never think of it again as a thing of\r\nweakness. It means infinite power to me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old _Red Bird_!\" said Ned; \"there are her bones!\"\r\n\r\nThere indeed lay what was left of the boat, where it had been drifted\r\nupon the sands by the swell. The tide, which had now begun to run out,\r\nhad left the wreck \"high and dry,\" and instinctively the boys went to\r\nlook at it, Charley managing now to stagger forward slowly.\r\n\r\nThe wreck was a mass of timbers, ribs, and planking, looking like a boat\r\nthat has been crushed flat under some enormous weight.\r\n\r\n\"What kept her from going all to bits?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Her copper bolts,\" answered Ned. \"You see, she was particularly well\r\nbuilt. There wasn't a nail in her. From stem to stern all the fastenings\r\nwere of copper, and copper is so tough that no ordinary wrenching will\r\nbreak it. It bends instead. But if we had simply run upon a beach in\r\nthat sea, even copper bolts wouldn't have held the pieces together.\r\nEvery wave would have lifted the wreck up and dashed it down on the sand\r\nuntil the planks and ribs were beaten into bits. As it is, the _Red\r\nBird_ struck only once. The next wave that came lifted her up and\r\ncarried her clear across the reef into deep water before it dropped her,\r\nand so she received only that one blow. Once inside the reef, she\r\ndrifted with the swell toward shore. She is an utter wreck though, and\r\nwill never sail again.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy tone in the boy's voice as he said this, for he\r\nhad sailed in this boat many and many a time, and had come to love her\r\nas if she had been a live thing.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what, boys,\" said Jack; \"we've got to start toward camp.\r\nIt won't do to be caught out to-night without supper or fire. Weary and\r\nsoaked as we are, we shall be sick if we don't get something to eat and\r\na fire to sleep by. Let's get a vine and tie the wreck here so that it\r\ncan't drift away with the next tide, and then be off at once. It's\r\nnearly sunset.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the \"bones\" of the boat were well secured, the boys set out;\r\nCharley having recovered his strength somewhat, they walked at a good\r\npace along the shore, and reached camp just at dark. Building a large\r\nfire they soon had a hearty supper, with plenty of hot coffee, and when\r\nsupper was done, they gladly put themselves to bed, aching a good deal\r\nfrom exhaustion, but really unharmed by their adventure.\r\n\r\nJack was the first to wake the next morning, but he did not get up\r\nimmediately. He lay still, evidently thinking. After a while he arose\r\nquietly and, before dressing himself, made an examination of the stores\r\nof food on hand. Finally he roused his companions, and the three took a\r\ndip into the water.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jack, when all were seated at breakfast, \"I want you boys to\r\nhelp me think a little, and you, Ned, to answer some questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Ned, \"I'm thinking already.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"That these fish aren't as fresh as they might be; so I'm going fishing\r\nbefore dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact,\" said Ned and Charley in a breath. \"We haven't a boat\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jack. \"We have no boat, and that's what I want to think\r\nabout. How far is it to Bluffton, Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twelve miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the nearest point on the mainland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we've got to stay here till we can build a boat with such tools\r\nand materials as we have, if we can do it at all,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do it,\" said Ned, with a look of consternation on his face;\r\n\"we lack nearly every thing. We haven't even the plank!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't let's become demoralized,\" said Jack, who, ever since the\r\naccident of the day before, had been the leading spirit of the party.\r\n\"We must keep our wits about us and lay our plans intelligently. But\r\nfirst of all we must look the facts in the face. We are on a deserted\r\nisland twelve miles from the mainland, without a boat. We must stay here\r\nuntil we can make arrangements of some kind for getting away, and that\r\nwill be a good deal longer than we thought of staying when we came, for\r\nI don't suppose you meant it, Ned, when you told Maum Sally that we'd be\r\ngone a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I hadn't a thought of staying more than a few days, or a week at\r\nmost. We didn't bring enough provisions to last for more than a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I was coming to,\" said Jack. \"I've been looking over our\r\nstores this morning. We've got to face the fact that we haven't nearly\r\nenough, and we must use what we have judiciously, taking great care to\r\nadd other things as we can. Unluckily we lost our best friend when the\r\ngun went down in the wreck of the _Red Bird_. We can't hunt, but must\r\ndepend upon other sources of supply. I suppose, Ned, there's very little\r\nto be done fishing from the shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all, I imagine,\" replied Ned; \"but I may possibly catch a\r\nfew mullets with the cast net. You see mullets run up into little bays\r\nto feed, and we sometimes go after them with the net, especially at\r\nnight. Then I can catch shrimps and some few crabs, and I suppose we\r\nshall find an oyster bank somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, \"I suppose we can manage somehow to get enough food;\r\nthe trouble will be to get variety enough. Shrimps and crabs and oysters\r\nand fish are good food, but one doesn't want to make them an exclusive\r\ndiet. For health we must have variety.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Ned, \"and our greatest trouble will be about bread.\r\nWe haven't flour or rice or sweet potatoes enough to last more than a\r\nfew days.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jack, \"and we have nothing to substitute for them. We must\r\nhave everything of the vegetable kind that we can get. Now what is\r\nthere? I don't know, and can't think of a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are several things,\" said Ned, \"such as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll hunt for them. What are they?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"There may possibly be wild sweet potatoes somewhere on the island,\r\nthough that is doubtful. The soft parts of most roots are edible; there\r\nare plenty of wild grapes in the woods, I suppose, and for a good\r\nsubstantial vegetable, we can eat an occasional dish of algæ.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"'What are they,' you should say; noun of the first declension,--alga,\r\nalgæ, algæ, algam, etc.,--so algæ is the nominative plural.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stop the declension--we have enough of that at school--and tell us\r\nwhat algæ are,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Sea-weeds. There are a great variety of them, and many kinds are eaten\r\nin different parts of the world. They are all harmless and more or less\r\nnutritious. We can try the different sorts that come ashore here and use\r\nthe best that we can get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we boil them?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. We'll try that and see, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Now we must manage each day to get as much food, of one kind\r\nand another, as we eat; it won't do to run short and trust to the\r\nfuture. We must save our flour and bacon for special occasions and as a\r\nreserve to fall back upon if at any time the supplies of other food fail\r\nus. We must keep our coffee, too, for use in case of sickness, or a bad\r\ndrenching in a cold rain. There may be times when we shall need it\r\nbadly, and so we must do without it now. I think we shall get on pretty\r\nwell for several weeks, and by that time I hope we shall be ready to\r\nleave the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've a plan, but I'm not sure about it yet. I thought of it\r\nyesterday, just after we came ashore. You two see what you can do toward\r\ngetting some food, while I go off to inspect and lay my plans. When I\r\ncome back I'll tell you about them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jack departed without telling his companions what he meant to do,\r\nNed and Charley went up the shore with the cast net, and managed, within\r\nan hour or two, to secure a good supply of shrimps, one or two mullets,\r\nand a few oysters, though they discovered no oyster bed, as they had\r\nexpected to do. They hoped to accomplish this by a longer journey along\r\nthe shore, to be made on some other day. Having enough fish and shrimps\r\nfor immediate use, they wished now to see what could be done toward\r\nsecuring a supply of vegetable food. They discovered no palmetto trees,\r\nbut gave their attention to the wild grapes, of which there were a good\r\nmany in the woods.\r\n\r\nIt was well past mid-day when Ned and Charley, loaded with their spoils\r\nof sea and land, returned to the camp. There they found Jack, sitting on\r\na log meditating.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" he said, \"the important thing is not to let any thing discourage\r\nus. We must keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly,\" said Charley, \"but what's the special occasion of this\r\nlecture?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure that no matter what happens, you'll not give up, or grow\r\nscared, or get excited in any way?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must say--\" began Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Charley,\" said Ned; \"something's wrong. Let's hear what Jack has\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Jack? Tell us quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, only that we're out of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that some animal or other has robbed us while we were all away\r\nfrom camp! Every thing's gone, even to the box of salt and the coffee.\r\nWe haven't a thing to eat except what you've brought with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPLANS AND DEVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo say that the boys were shocked and distressed by their new mishap, is\r\nvery feebly to express their state of mind. There was consternation in\r\nthe camp, from which Jack alone partially escaped. Jack had an\r\nuncommonly cool head. In ordinary circumstances there was nothing\r\nwhatever to distinguish him from other boys. He rushed into difficulties\r\nas recklessly as anybody--as he did on the first day when he tried to\r\nuse the cast net,--and joined in all sports and boyish enterprises with\r\nas little thought as boys usually show. But in real difficulty Jack\r\nFarnsworth was seen in a new light. He was calm, thoughtful, resolute,\r\nand full of resource. Ned had his first hint of this during that last\r\nvoyage of the _Red Bird_, and as their difficulties multiplied both Ned\r\nand Charley learned to look upon Jack as their leader. They turned to\r\nhim now precisely as if he had been much older than themselves, and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are we to do, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" Jack replied, \"we are to keep perfectly cool. Excitement\r\nwill not only keep us from doing the best that we can, but it will\r\nweaken us and unfit us for work, even if it doesn't bring on actual\r\nsickness, which it may do. Care killed a cat, you know. We positively\r\nmust not get excited. After all, what occasion for uneasiness is there?\r\nWe are pretty genuine Crusoes now, but we can stand that. We are\r\nliterally wrecked upon a deserted island. We have lost our boat and our\r\nboots, our hats, our gun and our supply of provisions, and so we are not\r\nquite so well situated as Robinson Crusoe was; but on the other hand\r\nwe're not going to stay here year after year as he did, and besides\r\nthere are three of us to keep each other company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, company's good, of course,\" said Charley Black, \"but I'm not so\r\nsure on the other points.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about our getting away sooner than Crusoe did. I don't\r\nsee how we're to get away at all for that matter, but may be somebody\r\nwill rescue us after twenty-eight years or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if they do,\" said Ned, \"won't it be jolly fun to go back to\r\nschool then, with long whiskers, and make old Bingham take us through\r\nthe rest of Cæsar!\"\r\n\r\nNed was naturally buoyant in spirits, and the spice of difficulty and\r\ndanger in their situation had now begun to stimulate his gayety instead\r\nof depressing him. He was of too hopeful a nature to believe that their\r\nenforced stay upon the island was likely to be very greatly prolonged,\r\nalthough, if put to the proof, he had no more notion than Charley Black\r\nhad, of a possible means of escape.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jack Farnsworth, \"and after that length of time we'll\r\nhave a lot of things to learn besides Latin. We'll have to study\r\ngeography all over again to find out how many States there are in the\r\nUnion, and whether France has swallowed Germany, or Russia has conquered\r\nEngland and moved her capital to London. Then, again, Ned, your science\r\nwill be out of date, and you won't dare to mention oxygen even, for fear\r\nthat somebody has found long ago that there isn't any such thing as\r\noxygen. We'll be regular Rip Van Winkles. Who knows? Perhaps we shall\r\nfind the United States turned into an empire, and steam-engines\r\nforgotten, and electricity, or something that we've never heard of,\r\ndoing the world's work. On the whole, I think if we stay here\r\ntwenty-eight years, it will be better not to leave the island at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe banter between Ned and Jack was kept up in this way for some time,\r\nNed talking for fun merely, while Jack talked for the purpose of\r\novercoming poor Charley's evident depression of spirits. Finally Jack\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"But we're not going to be Rip Van Winkles or even Crusoes very long.\r\nWe'll have our lark out and then go back home in time for school--say\r\nabout three weeks or a month hence, keeping Ned's appointment with Maum\r\nSally.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how on earth are we to get back?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"In a boat, to be sure; we can't walk twelve miles on the water,\"\r\nanswered Jack, \"particularly now that we're barefooted. We'd get our\r\nfeet wet, without a doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we to get a boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is what I've been thinking about,\" said Jack, \"and I think\r\nI've worked the problem out.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, what's the answer?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that we must rebuild the _Red Bird_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we? She is mashed into kindling wood,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"No, not quite,\" answered Jack. \"She is badly mashed, certainly, but\r\nit's simply mashing. I have been to look at her. She lies there as flat\r\nas if a steam-ship had sat down upon her, but I have carefully examined\r\nevery stick of her timber, and while the _Red Bird_ is no more a boat\r\nthan a lumber pile is a house, still she is a pretty good pile of\r\nlumber. Comparatively few of her planks are badly split or broken, while\r\nher ribs seem to be broken only in one or two places each. After\r\nexamining her very carefully I am satisfied that her timbers will\r\nfurnish us enough material for a new boat. We must build a smaller boat\r\nout of her bones--particularly a shorter boat. She was twenty-four feet\r\nlong, and by shortening her in the middle--that is, by leaving out the\r\nmiddle ribs--we shall have enough planking to make a new boat. Patching\r\nup the ribs will be the most difficult job, but I think we can manage\r\nit. Most of the planks are broken in two, but we can join the ends on\r\nribs, and, if we are patient, we can make a pretty good boat. Patience\r\nis the one thing needful, especially for inexperienced workmen with a\r\nscanty supply of tools. We must make good joints if we have to work a\r\nweek over the joining of two boards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do for nails?\" asked Ned; \"we haven't more than a pound\r\nor two here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't a single nail,\" said Jack; \"the wild animal, whatever it\r\nwas, that robbed us, seems to have had a very miscellaneous appetite. It\r\nnot only took our flour and bacon, our salt and our coffee and sugar; it\r\nseems to have had an appetite for nails and blankets too. At any rate,\r\nit stole them all, but luckily it didn't find the tools, because you had\r\nthe hatchet with you, and I had the axe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mischief!\" exclaimed Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's mischief enough for that matter, but it might have been\r\nworse. I suppose some rascals landed here while we were away and robbed\r\nus. Of course it couldn't have been an animal, although that was my\r\nfirst thought when I found the provisions gone. Whoever it was he isn't\r\nlikely to come again, but we must watch our camp now, and particularly\r\nwe must take care of our tools.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you haven't answered my question about nails,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"We must make them of the _Red Bird's_ copper bolts,\" answered Jack;\r\n\"and if we run short we can use wooden pins; but I think there is an\r\nabundance of the copper. Luckily the anchor came ashore entangled in the\r\nwreck, and that will serve us for an anvil. We can hammer the bolts into\r\nnails, using the hatchet for a hammer. It will be slow work, because\r\nwhile the hatchet is in use making nails we can't use it in building the\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Charley, whose spirits began now to revive;\r\n\"we'll work hard of nights making nails, and have them ready for the\r\nnext day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we shan't want any nails for a day or two, while we're making\r\npreparations to begin, and so we can get a good supply in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Ned; \"but do you know we're wasting precious time? It\r\nis nearly sundown, and we have a lot to do before we go to bed. We\r\nhaven't thought of dinner yet, and we can't now till after our work is\r\ndone. We must bring the wreck around here to-night. The fellow that\r\nrobbed our camp was probably some negro squatter from some of the\r\nislands around us, and if he got sight of the wreck on his way back, he\r\nis sure to come over and carry away all that is valuable of the _Red\r\nBird's_ bones to-night. We must get ahead of him, and bring the wreck\r\naround to the camp the first thing we do.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion commended itself to Ned's companions, and the boys set\r\noff at once, taking the axe and hatchet with them.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the wreck the tide was very nearly full, so that\r\nthere was not much difficulty in getting the remains of the _Red Bird_\r\nafloat. It was a mere raft of plank and timbers, of course, which must\r\nbe dragged through the water along the shore by means of the anchor rope\r\nand some wild vines cut in the woods. For a time the still incoming tide\r\nwas in their favor, and they travelled the first half mile pretty\r\nrapidly. When the tide turned, however, the labor became very severe,\r\nand it was ten o'clock at night when the wreck of the _Red Bird_ was\r\nsafely landed at the camp. The boys were exhausted with work, and very\r\nhungry. Ned stirred up the fire and put on a kettle of salt water, into\r\nwhich, as soon as it boiled, he poured a quart or two of shrimps.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make a shrimp dinner to-night,\" he said, \"and that will leave us\r\nthe mullets and wild grapes for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Jack; \"I'm hungry enough not to care for variety\r\nto-night; speed is the word just now.\"\r\n\r\nDinner over, the boys had still to collect a large mass of the long gray\r\nmoss to serve instead of the stolen blankets, so that it was quite\r\nmidnight when they finally got to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOME OF NED'S SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How shall we cook our fish, Ned?\" asked Charley, the next morning. He\r\nhad already thrown wood upon the embers when Ned and Jack came out of\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\n\"We must roast them,\" said Ned, \"now that we have no bacon to fry them\r\nwith. We can broil sometimes and roast sometimes, for variety. Without\r\nbutter broiled fish are rather dry. I'll be cook this morning, and show\r\nyou how to roast small fish.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he went to the beach and walked along the water's edge till he\r\nfound a bunch of clean, wet sea-weed. Returning to the fire, he\r\ncarefully wrapped the mullets in this, and placed them in the hot ashes,\r\ncovering them with live coals to a depth of several inches. Half an hour\r\nlater he took them carefully out of their wrappings, and placed them on\r\nthe log that did duty for a table.\r\n\r\nThe fish were beautifully done, and looked as tempting as possible, but,\r\nupon tasting them, a look of consternation came over Jack's countenance.\r\n\r\n\"I never thought of that,\" said Jack, \"but we are out of salt! What\r\nshall we do? We can't live altogether on shrimps and oysters; and fish\r\nwithout salt is a difficult dish to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make some salt,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the sea-water?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It is slow work, and without clarifying materials we'll get a\r\nrather black product, but it will be salt for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will make it black?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Impurities. The sea-water is filled with various things--common salt,\r\nmostly, of course, but there are Glauber's salts, Epsom salts, magnesia,\r\nand many other things, including salts of silver and iron. In making\r\nsalt out of sea-water, these impurities must be got rid of, or the salt\r\nwill be of a dirty brownish color. We can't clarify it, but we can use\r\nit very well for all our purposes. We'll have to put up with a poor\r\nbreakfast, but we'll do better by night. I'll start our salt-works\r\nimmediately after breakfast, and then I'll leave Charley in charge of\r\nthe business, because I have an idea of my own that I want to carry out.\r\nWe must devote ourselves to-day exclusively to the business of getting\r\nfood, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the first thing to be done. We are at the starvation point\r\nand must get something to eat before we begin on the boat. What is the\r\nplan that you speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't tell you, because it may come to nothing, though I'm hopeful.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I hope it will turn out well. Meantime, I'll take the cast\r\nnet and get some shrimps and possibly some fish, and then if I had any\r\nthing to bait with, I would set some rabbit traps or something of that\r\nsort. But I haven't, and so I can't. Charley can carry on the salt-works\r\nwhile you do whatever it is you mean to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe salt-works consisted of nothing more than the kettle. Filling this\r\nwith clear sea-water, Ned set it to boil, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Charley, as it boils down add more water, and toward night we can\r\nstop adding water and let the salt settle. It will begin to settle\r\nbefore that time, and when it does you can dip the wet salt up from the\r\nbottom and spread it out on a plank to dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll make a dipper out of a tin cup by fastening a stick to\r\nit for a handle. But what makes the salt settle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see? You can only dissolve a certain amount of salt in a\r\ncertain amount of water; if you put more in it sinks to the bottom,\r\nbeing heavier than water, and stays there. When a liquid has as much of\r\nany thing dissolved in it as it can hold, it is said to be saturated; we\r\ncall it a saturated solution. Now when you boil sea-water it evaporates,\r\nand the quantity of water steadily decreases. After awhile so much of\r\nthe water is evaporated that we have a saturated solution, and then if\r\nyou evaporate half a pint more of it the salt that a half pint of water\r\ncan hold in solution must settle to the bottom. It is a curious fact\r\nthat water which is saturated with one substance, so that it can not\r\nhold any more of it, is still capable of dissolving other substances and\r\nholding them in solution. Sometimes, in making salt, men take advantage\r\nof that fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked Jack, who had become interested in Ned's explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Why, by washing out the impurities of the salt with salt water. Having\r\na quantity of impure salt they put it into a funnel-shaped vessel with a\r\nsmall hole in the bottom; then they take clear water and pure salt and\r\nmake a saturated solution of that; this water cannot dissolve any more\r\nsalt, but it is still capable of dissolving the other substances which\r\nconstitute impurities; so it is poured into the vessel that contains the\r\nimpure salt, and as it passes through it dissolves and carries off the\r\nimpurities, but doesn't dissolve any of the salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we purify our salt in that way?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Because we have no pure salt with which to make the solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, but I didn't think of it. I wish I knew as much as you do\r\nabout such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much,\" answered Ned. \"I have always been curious to know\r\nfacts of the sort, and my father has encouraged me to find them out. I\r\nask questions and read what books I can on such subjects; but I learn\r\nmost by looking and thinking for myself. Still I know very little about\r\nscientific matters; really I do. But we're wasting time; I must be off\r\nand so must you, Jack. Keep the salt kettle boiling, Charley, and don't\r\nforget to add water to it from time to time. When you pour cold water in\r\nyou can skim the scum off, and in that way you'll get rid of a good deal\r\nof impurity.\"\r\n\r\nWith that the boys separated. Jack went down along the shore, with the\r\ncast-net in his hand; while Ned struck off into the woods with the\r\ncoffee-pot, which, now that the boys had no coffee, was no longer in use\r\nat camp.\r\n\r\nJack returned about noon, bringing back a fine lot of shrimps, half a\r\ndozen fish, a few crabs, and some oysters, together with the news that\r\nhe had discovered a large oyster bank which could be reached by wading\r\nat low tide.\r\n\r\nCharley greeted him with a smiling face on which there was a look of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Jack,\" he said, going to a plank upon which there were two\r\nor three little white heaps; \"Ned is out in his science this time; I've\r\ngot beautifully white salt as you see, and not the dark, impure stuff he\r\nsaid I would get; but that isn't all; instead of settling to the bottom\r\nof the kettle, it rises to the top to be skimmed off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I could have told you that,\" said Ned, who had arrived unobserved.\r\n\"It's a way that it has. Taste your salt, Charley.\"\r\n\r\nCharley did so, looked puzzled, and then turned to Ned.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, old fellow?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, beautifully white salt to be sure,\" answered Ned; \"isn't that what\r\nyou said it was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I said that,\" answered Charley, \"but now I know better. It is\r\ntasteless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Magnesia usually is,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Is that magnesia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the main. It is mixed a little with other things perhaps, but\r\nit is mostly magnesia. That is why I told you to skim it off. We don't\r\nwant it in the salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't any salt,\" said Charley, \"I've filled the kettle up every\r\nfifteen minutes but no salt has settled yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your solution isn't saturated yet,\" said Ned. \"This water contains only\r\nabout two per cent of salt, or possibly in its impure state three per\r\ncent. To make one kettleful of salt we must boil away from thirty to\r\nfifty kettlefuls of water. The kettle holds two gallons, and so, in\r\norder to get a pint of salt we must boil away two or three kettlefuls of\r\nwater. You have filled it up enough for to-day; now keep it boiling and\r\nwe'll get a pint or two of salt, before night, and meantime we can pour\r\na little of the boiled-down water on our fish for dinner, for I'm\r\nhungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Ned,\" said Jack, \"what luck have you had?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I've brought back a coffee-pot half full, and have made\r\narrangements for more to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I like puzzles and riddles and things of that sort,\" said Jack,\r\n\"but I hate to wait for 'our next month's number' for the answer. What\r\nis it you've got in the coffee-pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bread,\" answered Ned, \"or a substitute for it. I've been gathering the\r\nseeds of grasses and weeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seeds of grasses!\" exclaimed Charley; \"why, who ever heard of anybody\r\neating grass seeds?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've turned sceptic, Charley, since your faith in your beautiful\r\nwhite salt received such a shock,\" said Ned; \"but still I think some\r\ngrass seeds are occasionally eaten by men,--wheat, for example, and\r\nrice and corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Charley, abashed; \"only I never thought of wheat and\r\nrice, etc., as grasses. But are wild grass seeds good to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. All ordinary grass seeds are composed of substantially\r\nthe same materials, and they are all nutritious. I have gathered about a\r\nquart, meaning to mash them up and make a sort of bread out of them; but\r\nthere isn't time for that now, so I mean to boil them for dinner. The\r\nimportant thing is to have some kind of grain food to eat, and in that\r\nway we'll get it somewhat as if we had rice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a capital idea, Ned,\" said Jack. \"Is there plenty of seed to be\r\nhad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, now that I know where it is, though it is very slow work gathering\r\nsuch seed. I have only to gather it and winnow it. I can winnow a little\r\nfaster next time, because I shall take something along to winnow upon,\r\nif it is only a clean handkerchief. I've thought of something else too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Acorns and other nuts. They are rather green yet, but they are\r\nnutritious, and we can beat them into a palatable bread. Hogs grow fat\r\non them, and there is no reason why they should not prove nutritious to\r\nus. I'm going to find some edible roots, too, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a splendid provider you are, Ned,\" said Charley, \"particularly as\r\nwe have the oysters, shrimps, etc., for a foundation to build upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Ned, \"do you know I have been thinking that we should\r\nnot starve even if we hadn't the water for a source of supply?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In casting about for a variety of things to eat, I have naturally tried\r\nto think of every thing that could support life, and have been surprised\r\nto find how many things there are that can be eaten in extreme cases. If\r\nwe were in real danger of starving we could eat snails and earthworms\r\nfor meat----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" exclaimed Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, snails and earthworms are both regarded as delicacies by many\r\npeople in France. They actually have snail farms, where the creatures\r\nare fattened for market.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as a business. There is a demand for snails at high prices,\r\nbecause people who can pay well for them are fond of them. Then we could\r\nkill a few snakes and lizards here, I suppose. In fact, I killed a snake\r\nthis afternoon, and if I hadn't been afraid of disgusting you fellows, I\r\nshould have brought it home as a valuable contribution to our larder,\r\nfor snakes are uncommonly good eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever eat one?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; or at least a part of one. There is no reason why snakes should\r\nnot be eaten, except a groundless prejudice. Their flesh is both good\r\nand wholesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for our scientist!\" said Jack. \"I begin to see now, that our\r\nsupplies are a good deal greater than I supposed. For my part, I mean to\r\nhave a snake breakfast some of these mornings just for variety's sake.\r\nWhy, we shall begin to live like princes presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you really lay aside prejudice, Jack, and eat a well-cooked\r\nsnake?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Charley?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no objection, now that I think of it,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then I'll go for my snake. It isn't a hundred yards away,\r\nand it will furnish us meat, which is much more strengthening than an\r\nexclusive diet of fish and such things can be.\"\r\n\r\nThe snake--a large one--was brought to camp, skinned, dressed, and\r\nbroiled to a crisp brown on a bed of coals. When done it was appetizing\r\nboth in appearance and in odor, and the boys, who, naturally, were very\r\nhungry after their scanty breakfast and diligent work, ate it with keen\r\nrelish, eating with it some boiled grass seeds. The only complaint made\r\nconcerning the grass seeds was that there was not half enough of them.\r\n\r\nThe salt kettle had been filled more frequently than Ned had supposed,\r\nand the yield for the day was more nearly a quart than a pint.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are beginning to know how to live,\" said Jack. \"We have only to\r\nget a good start and keep a fair supply of food ahead. But we must lay\r\nin a good stock of seeds to-morrow. I'll go with you, Ned, and we'll\r\nboth work at that, while Charley minds camp and makes salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow will be Sunday,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"No it won't; this is Friday,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see,\" said Ned. \"We got to Bluffton on Monday evening, didn't we?\r\nWell, the next day we went fishing; that was Tuesday. The next day we\r\ncame over here; that was Wednesday. The next day, Thursday, the wreck of\r\nthe _Red Bird_ occurred. Friday we spent in getting food and bringing\r\nthe wreck around here to the camp. That was yesterday, and so to-day is\r\nSaturday. Lucky that Charley thought of it. We mustn't work to-morrow,\r\nand so we must catch a lot of shrimps and fish with the net to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys worked with the net until nearly midnight, and slept late the\r\nnext morning. They observed Sunday as a day of rest, and rest was a\r\nthing that they greatly needed just at that time. It was agreed that on\r\nMonday morning Jack and Ned should go after grass seed, while Charley\r\nshould mind camp, make salt, and use the net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nJACK'S DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harvest of seeds from which Ned and Jack were to draw their\r\nsupplies, was found in an abandoned field, half a mile from the camp.\r\nHere various wild grasses and weeds grew in rank profusion, and had\r\nalready ripened in the sun. Some yielded seeds so small and so few in\r\nnumber that it was a waste of time to thresh them; others were richer in\r\nlarger seeds; while many of the weeds, particularly, gave a profuse\r\nsupply of seeds almost as large as grains of wheat, but these were\r\nmostly worthless.\r\n\r\nNed was the recognized \"scientist\" of the party, and upon him devolved\r\nthe task and responsibility of determining what kinds of seed to gather\r\nand what to leave. He was familiar with the ordinary plants of the\r\ncountry, and knew which of them were poisonous. It remained only to\r\ndetermine whether or not a seed, known to be harmless, was of any value\r\nas food, and Ned's method of doing this was very simple. He bit the seed\r\nto discover what he could about its flavor and general character in that\r\nway; then he split a seed and inspected it. If it seemed to consist\r\nprincipally of starch, gluten, and fruity matter, he accepted that kind\r\nof seed; if it appeared dry, hard, and black upon the inside, he deemed\r\nit unworthy.\r\n\r\nPassing the point at which he had gathered seeds on the day before, Ned\r\nselected a good spot for a threshing-floor, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jack, I'll clear a space here and get ready for threshing; we'll\r\nget on faster in that way. You go off out there and gather grasses.\r\nPretty soon I'll join you, and when we get a supply, we'll thresh\r\nawhile.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the boys separated. Ned worked diligently at his clearing, and\r\nJack brought in armfuls of grass.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile Ned finished his task and began to wonder what had became\r\nof Jack, who had been absent for a considerable time. He called, but\r\nJack did not answer. Thinking nothing of the matter he went on with the\r\nwork of gathering grass. Still Jack did not return, and after an hour\r\nhad passed Ned became positively uneasy. He again called aloud, and Jack\r\nanswered, but his voice came from a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nContinuing his work Ned waited, and after awhile he heard Jack coming\r\nthrough a briar thicket, muttering complaints of some sort with a good\r\ndeal of vigor.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, old fellow?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Matter enough,\" answered Jack, from the depths of the briar patch in\r\nwhich he was completely hidden; \"I'm torn to pieces by the briars, and\r\nby the time I get to you I shan't have enough skin left on me to serve\r\nfor patches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Ned; \"shield your face with your arm and break right\r\nthrough. Your clothes are thick and stout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jack, \"so they are; but I haven't got them on.\"\r\n\r\nNed leaped to his feet, for he had been kneeling to arrange the grass\r\nfor threshing. He remembered how rapidly he and his companions had been\r\nreduced in their possessions, until now they were boatless, bootless,\r\nhatless, and without regular supplies of food; and so when Jack declared\r\nthat he had no clothes on, Ned at once imagined that some new calamity\r\nhad befallen him.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he exclaimed. \"No clothes! Why, we'll be naked savages before\r\nanother week is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say I had no clothes,\" answered Jack, still picking his way\r\ncarefully through the briars. \"I only said I had no clothes on, or at\r\nleast none to speak of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you must be out of your head,\" answered Ned. \"Why don't you\r\nput them on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I can't till we get to camp,\" and with that Jack made a final\r\nleap into the open space and stood before his astonished companion. He\r\npresented a queer appearance. For clothing he had on only his drawers\r\nand a thin undershirt. These were torn and stained with blood from many\r\nscratches. Jack's face, too, was a good deal scratched, but there was a\r\ntriumphant look in his eyes which made Ned forget to look at the briar\r\nwounds. Jack's trowsers, tied at bottom and stuffed full of some heavy\r\nmaterial, sat astride his neck, looking for all the world like the\r\nlower half of a very fat boy. His shirt, also well filled, was carried\r\nin one hand, while his coat, made into a bundle and likewise filled, was\r\nheld in the other.\r\n\r\n\"What in the name of common-sense have you been stuffing your clothes\r\nwith, Jack?\" asked Ned in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Grass seed,\" answered Jack, throwing his burden on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" said Ned; \"why it would take both of us a month to gather\r\nand thresh out that quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you scientific people always recognized one fact as worth\r\nmore than any number of 'must be's'; here I have the facts--a\r\ntrowsers-full, a shirt-full, and a coat-full,--and yet you argue about\r\nwhat must be and what can't be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit the trowsers and the shirt and the coat, and I see that they\r\nare full,\" said Ned; \"I only doubt the character of their contents. I\r\ndon't believe you could have gathered such a quantity of grass seed\r\nwithin so short a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not of the kind that grows here, but mine are not of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me look at them,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Not till we get to camp; I can't open the bags without spilling a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell me about it then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was gathering grasses over there by those tall trees, when I\r\nhappened to look away toward the south. There I saw, about half a mile\r\naway, what looked like a patch of ripe wheat or oats. There were two or\r\nthree acres of it down in a sort of marsh, so I went over there to see\r\nwhat it was. I found the little marsh covered thickly with a tall grass\r\nsomewhat like oats, and all had gone to seed. The seeds are about the\r\nsize of grains of wheat, but rather longer, and each grain, when\r\nthreshed out, is covered with a brown husk that clings closely to the\r\nbody of the grain. The seeds themselves are starchy, glutinous, and, if\r\nI am not mistaken, excellent food. It was too far to call you, so I made\r\nup my mind I would thresh some of the grass and bring away what I could\r\nof the result. I filled my shirt, coat, and trowsers, and I should have\r\nused my drawers in the same way if I could have carried any more. As it\r\nis, I've a big load.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so,\" answered Ned, \"and a mighty good load, too, if I'm\r\nnot mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you suppose it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grass seed,\" answered Ned, \"of the kind that we call _rice_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did it come there?\" asked Jack. \"Does rice grow wild?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sometimes. When a rice field is allowed to stand too long before\r\ncutting, the grain drops out of the heads, of course, and the next year\r\na fair volunteer crop comes up. In this case, I suppose, the explanation\r\nis simple. When the island was abandoned during the war, there was\r\nprobably a growing crop of rice in that little swamp. If so, it went to\r\nseed, and not being harvested, the seed fell to the ground, coming up\r\nagain the next year only to repeat the process year after year. That's\r\nmy explanation at any rate, and the only one I can think of. But come!\r\nlet's go to camp. It isn't worth while now to fool away time over this\r\ngrass. Now that you have found a rice field, we'll eat rice instead, and\r\nsome day soon we'll go there and bring back enough to last us till we\r\nleave the island.\"\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at camp the contents of Jack's clothes proved to be,\r\nas Ned had conjectured, rough rice; that is to say, rice from which the\r\nouter husks have been removed, leaving only the closely clinging inner\r\nhusk on the grain. The amount secured was sufficient to last the boys\r\nfor a considerable time, and in the absence of bread, it was a thing of\r\nno little moment to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAN ANXIOUS NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDinner was cooked and eaten as soon as possible after the return of Ned\r\nand Jack to camp, because all three of the boys were eager to make the\r\nlong-deferred beginning upon the new boat.\r\n\r\n\"The _Red Bird_ was wrecked last Thursday,\" said Charley, \"and now it is\r\nMonday, and yet we haven't even begun to get ready to prepare to\r\ncommence to build.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes we have, Charley,\" said Jack. \"We have worked diligently at the\r\nmost important part of the task. We have made first-rate arrangements\r\nfor food, and that is a good beginning. But we'll actually begin on the\r\nboat itself to-day. By the way, Ned, you're to be the master-builder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know about that,\" said Ned; \"you were bragging the other\r\nday about your mechanical skill, and I'm very modest in that direction.\r\nI'm actually a clumsy hand with tools.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't brag,\" said Jack; \"I only stated facts. I believe I am a\r\nbetter workman with tools than either of you fellows, and for that\r\nreason I'm willing to take the most difficult jobs on myself, but you\r\nmust be the superintendent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Because, even if you are clumsy with tools, you know more about a boat\r\nin a minute than Charley and I do in a year, and it's a good rule to put\r\neach fellow at the thing he can do best.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Charley; \"I'm the best hand you ever saw at sitting on\r\na log and watching you fellows work, so I'll take that for my share.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't,\" said Ned. \"If I'm to superintend this job I'll find\r\nsomething better than that for you to do. But I say, Jack, it's absurd\r\nfor me to try to tell you how to do things that you can do ten times as\r\nwell as I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to tell me how to do, but what to do; then we'll all\r\ndo it. I'll take the most difficult parts, and besides that I'll give\r\nyou and Charley some hints about how to do your share, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Ned, \"I'll be superintendent if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Jack. \"Now plan the boat, determine the dimensions,\r\nand tell us how to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me see,\" said Ned. \"The _Red Bird_ was twenty-four feet long\r\nin the keel--twenty-five feet over all,--and five feet wide amidships.\r\nWe must allow liberally for waste in trying to use the old materials, so\r\nwe'll take off six feet of length, giving the new boat a keel of\r\neighteen feet, a total length of nineteen feet, and let the beam width\r\ntake care of itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we shorten amidships only; that is to say we omit the six or eight\r\nribs that were in the middle of the old boat, and bring the next ribs\r\nforward and aft to the middle. Whatever width they give will be the\r\nwidth of the boat amidships. In that way we shall preserve the old\r\nproportions, while changing the old dimensions. The new boat will be, in\r\nshape, precisely what the _Red Bird_ would have been if we had cut out\r\nsix feet of her length amidships, and had then brought the two ends\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Charley. \"What is the first thing to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"To lay a keel,\" said Ned. \"The old keel is broken, so we must have a\r\nnew one. Besides, that was double, for a centre-board, and we'll have to\r\nbuild without a centre-board.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the dimensions of the keel?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen feet long, as nearly as we can guess, and about three inches\r\nby six or seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be set on edge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and to project below the bottom. That will give steadiness to the\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the best timber for the keel?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"White oak, if we had it, but we haven't. The long-leaf yellow pine is\r\nvery nearly as good, and for our purposes it is really better, because\r\nwe can work it more easily. There's a fine, small, straight tree trunk\r\njust beyond the camp that will suit us precisely. It has been lying for\r\nseveral years apparently, and is well seasoned. We have only to cut it\r\noff the right length, split off slabs till we get a rude square, and\r\nthen hew it down to the right dimensions with the axe and hatchet. That\r\nwill occupy us for two days at least, so let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\nThe event proved that Ned had underestimated the length of time\r\nnecessary for this work. The hard, flinty yellow pine, seasoned as it\r\nwas, was very difficult to work. The axe and hatchet were not very sharp\r\nat the outset, and before night both were distressingly dull. The next\r\nday, what edges they had were worn away, and it was difficult to cut\r\nwith them at all. Charley declared that he could do nearly as well with\r\nhis teeth, but he did not try that experiment. There was no grindstone\r\nin the camp, and none to be had, of course, and so the weary boys had to\r\nmake the best of a bad matter and work on as they could with the dull\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday the keel was not yet quite done, and the rice began to show\r\nthe effects of the boys' appetites.\r\n\r\n\"I say, fellows,\" said Charley, \"one of us must go for a fresh supply of\r\nrice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ned, \"it is ripening now, and will all fall if we don't\r\nsecure a good supply. You go, Charley, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'm worth less at carpenter's work than either of you, so I'll go.\r\nPull off your trowsers, both of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's--\" began Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" interrupted Charley, \"I ought to take a bag, or a sheet,\r\nor, still better, the spring wagon; but seeing that we haven't any\r\nwagon, or bag, or sheet, or any thing else to carry rice in, except\r\ntrowsers, I'm going to use trowsers; and remembering the tattered\r\ncondition of Jack's skin after his trowserless stroll through the\r\nbriars, I'm not going to use my own trowsers for a bag. So off with your\r\npantaloons, young men, and be quick about it, for I'm going to make two\r\ntrips to-day and bring in rice for the whole season.\"\r\n\r\nLaughing, the boys obeyed, and Charley left them at work in their shirts\r\nand drawers. He got back to camp at dinner-time, fully loaded. After\r\ndinner he made his second trip, saying that he would return about\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nSunset came at its appointed time, but Charley was not so punctual. It\r\ngrew dark, and still Charley did not appear. Ned and Jack began to grow\r\nuneasy. They went out into the woods in rear of their camp and called at\r\nthe top of their voices, but received no answer.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what, Ned,\" said Jack; \"we must build a beacon fire.\r\nCharley has stayed late to fill his trowser-bags, and has lost his way\r\ntrying to get back.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no sooner said than done. Pitch pine was piled on the fire, and a\r\nblaze made that might have been seen for many miles. The boys shouted\r\nthemselves hoarse too, but got no answer.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of waiting, Ned said:\r\n\r\n\"Jack, I'm going over to the rice patch to look for Charley. Something\r\nserious must have happened. You stay here and keep up a big fire. If I\r\nneed you I'll call at the top of my voice, and you will hear me I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Ned, it's an awful undertaking to go from here to the rice field\r\non such a night. It's as black as pitch, and you are barefooted and\r\nalmost naked; let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know all that,\" said Ned, \"but it would be cowardly to abandon\r\nCharley, and for my life I can't see that you are any better equipped\r\nfor the journey than I am. You're barefooted too, and as nearly naked as\r\nI am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" answered Jack, \"but I don't mind for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stay here, you great big-hearted, generous fellow!\" was all that\r\nNed said in reply, as he started away.\r\n\r\nBoth Jack and Ned knew that the journey thus undertaken would be\r\nattended by no little danger as well as sore discomfort and suffering.\r\nThe deadly moccasin and rattlesnake lurk in the grass and weeds of that\r\ncoast country, and the unshod boy was in peril of their fangs at every\r\nstep. He was too brave a boy, however, to shrink from danger when a real\r\nduty was to be done, and so he set forth manfully. Taking a stick he\r\nstruck the ground frequently, as a precaution against the danger of\r\nstepping upon any snake that might be in his path, and more than once he\r\nheard the venomous creatures hiss angrily before scurrying away.\r\n\r\nHe pressed forward too eagerly to pay due attention to briars and\r\nbrushwood, and so before he reached the rice swamp his scanty clothing\r\nwas nearly torn from his body and his skin was badly lacerated. His\r\ncoat protected his shoulders and arms, of course, but his legs, hands,\r\nand face suffered not a little.\r\n\r\nMeantime Jack kept up the beacon fire, suffering scarcely less with\r\nanxiety and impatience than Ned suffered from physical hurts. Poor Jack\r\nhad the hard task of waiting in terror and uncertainty. He imagined all\r\nmanner of evils that might have happened to Charley; then he became\r\nanxious about Ned. He shuddered to think of the dangers through which\r\nhis companion must be passing. The necessity of inactivity was\r\nintolerable; Jack could not sit or stand still. He felt that he should\r\ngo mad if he did not keep in motion. He paced up and down by the fire,\r\nas a caged tiger does. Finally, morbid fancies took possession of him.\r\nHe imagined that he heard Ned groan in the bushes on his left. Then he\r\nseemed to hear a cry of agony from Charley in the woods on his right.\r\nInvestigation revealed nothing, and Jack returned to his waiting in an\r\nagony of suspense.\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight when Ned returned, torn, bleeding, worn out with\r\nexertion, and very lame from a wound in his foot. He had trodden upon\r\nsome sharp thing, a thorn or sharp spike of wood, which had thrust\r\nitself deep into the flesh of his heel, and the wound was now badly\r\ninflamed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven, you are safe at any rate!\" exclaimed Jack fervently. \"Did\r\nyou find out any thing about poor Charley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" answered Ned, returning Jack's warm hand-clasp. \"I went to\r\nthe rice field and found the place where he had been threshing, but no\r\nother trace of him. He must have finished threshing, however, and\r\nstarted homeward, as he left no threshed rice there. I could not find a\r\ntrail in the dark, of course, and I can't imagine what has become of\r\nCharley. I called him repeatedly, and went all around the marsh, but it\r\nwas of no use. Besides, if he were anywhere in that region he would know\r\nthe way home, for I could see not only the light from this fire but the\r\nblaze itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you stay here now and let me go,\" said Jack, preparing to set\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use?\" asked Ned. \"I tell you I have done all that can be\r\ndone until daylight. If you go you'll only run the risk of laming\r\nyourself, and then there'll be nobody fit to take up the search when\r\nmorning comes to make it hopeful.\"\r\n\r\nThis was so obviously a sensible view of the situation, that Jack was\r\nforced, though reluctantly, to remain where he was.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the two boys waited and watched, keeping up the beacon\r\nfire, and occasionally investigating sounds which they heard or thought\r\nthat they heard in the woods and thickets around them. Naturally they\r\ntalked very little. There was nothing to talk of except Charley's\r\ndisappearance, and there was little to be said about that.\r\n\r\nIt began to rain, slowly at first, and in torrents toward morning, but\r\nneither boy thought of going into the hut for shelter. Indeed, neither\r\nboy seemed conscious of the fact that it was raining at all. They were\r\naware only of the horrible suspense in which they were passing the hours\r\nof a night which seemed almost endless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIN THE GRAY OF THE MORNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the first flush of dawn appeared Ned said: \"Jack, we mustn't lose our\r\nheads. You know what you said after the wreck. You and I have to look\r\nafter Charley to-day, and we may have need of all our wits and all our\r\nstrength; so, for his sake, if not for our own, we must force a full\r\nbreakfast down our throats. It will steady as well as strengthen us. I\r\ndon't want any thing to eat, and I suppose you don't, but we must eat\r\nfor all that. We haven't had a mouthful since noon yesterday, and we'll\r\nbe fit for no exertion if we go on in this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Jack; \"we must eat breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then let's be about it, so that we may have it over by the\r\ntime that it is fairly light, and then we'll lose no time in setting\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't leave camp,\" said Jack; \"your foot is awfully swollen and\r\nyour leg too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" answered Ned, \"but I am going anyhow. We must find\r\nCharley, and maybe both of us will be needed when we do.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion was going on the breakfast preparations were\r\nadvancing, and it was not long before the two disconsolate fellows began\r\nthe difficult task of forcing food down their unwilling throats.\r\n\r\n\"What is our best plan of operations, Jack?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely know. Perhaps we'd best go round the island, one one way and\r\nthe other the other, shouting and looking. Then, if either finds Charley\r\nand needs assistance the other will of course be there soon afterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly,\" said Ned. \"The island is pretty large, and I suppose it is a\r\ngood many miles around it. Wouldn't it be better to take a direct\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, by going first to the rice swamp. There we shall almost certainly\r\nbe able to find and follow Charley's trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Jack. \"What an idiot I was not to think of that\r\nfirst! The fact is, I believe last night's anxiety, particularly while\r\nyou were away, was too much for me. I lost my head a little, I think,\r\nand haven't quite found it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen! What's that?\" exclaimed Ned, rising to look. As he did so, the\r\nbushes near the shore on the left of the camp parted, and----\r\n\r\n\"Bless me! it's Charley!\" shouted both boys in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think I had run away with your trowsers?\" asked the cause of\r\nall their anxieties, throwing down the two pairs of pantaloons stuffed\r\nfull of wet rice.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious! Charley, where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've had an awful night!\" exclaimed Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Do I look as though I had had a particularly pleasant one?\" responded\r\nCharley. \"Do my dress and general appearance indicate that I dined last\r\nevening in the mansions of the great and slept upon a bed of down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" said Ned, unable as yet to share Charley's cheerfulness of\r\nmood; \"but really, Charley, we have suffered a good deal. You ought to\r\nhave come back to camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here, fellows,\" said Charley, more seriously than he had yet\r\nspoken, \"if you think I haven't known by instinct how much you would\r\nsuffer because of my unexplained absence, you do me great injustice. My\r\nsituation through the night has been none of the pleasantest, but the\r\nworst part of it has been what I have suffered thinking of your anxiety.\r\nPray, don't imagine that I'm totally destitute of feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a hurt tone in Charley's voice as he said this, to which Ned\r\nresponded at once.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Charley,\" he said, holding out his hand, which the other\r\ntook. \"I did not mean to reproach you wrongfully. I know your warm heart\r\nand generous soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Jack, \"and nothing in the world could have made us so happy\r\nas your safe return. But tell us what has happened. Where have you\r\nbeen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word until food is set before me,\" said Charley, relapsing into\r\nhis playful mood again. \"I am famished.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Ned; \"we cooked enough to take with us, and we didn't\r\neat much, so your breakfast is ready. In fact I begin to be hungry\r\nmyself, now that you've got back in safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Jack; \"let's begin over again, and all breakfast\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCHARLEY BLACK'S ADVENTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" said Jack, when breakfast was fairly begun, \"tell us all\r\nabout it, Charley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Charley, \"you know we're Robinson Crusoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! stop your nonsense and tell your story,\" said Ned, who was wildly\r\nimpatient to hear of Charley's adventures.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I am telling,\" answered Charley. \"As I said, we're\r\nRobinson Crusoes and I've seen the savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _do_ you mean?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Friday, of course, but that's a mistake too. His real name must be\r\nThursday, and he isn't tame either. Really I begin to believe Robinson\r\nCrusoe fibbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you gone crazy, Charley, or what is the matter?\" asked Ned,\r\nbeginning now to be really alarmed lest his comrade's experience,\r\nwhatever it had been, had unsettled his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I never was more rational in my life,\" replied the boy, with a smile;\r\n\"but you won't let me tell my story in my own way. Listen now and don't\r\ninterrupt. You remember how frightened Crusoe was when he discovered the\r\nfootprint in the sand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how he afterward found the savage who made it, and how disturbed he\r\nwas to learn that he was not really monarch of all he surveyed?\r\n\r\n\"Yes; well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been through a similar experience, only more so. This island\r\nis not uninhabited as we supposed. There are savages on it, and they are\r\nnot tame savages either, like Crusoe's man Friday, but decidedly savage\r\nsavages. My man Thursday is, at any rate. You see I call him Thursday\r\nbecause I first saw him yesterday, and that was Thursday. That's the way\r\nCrusoe hit upon a name for his savage, you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but tell us about it,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then. You know I went out to the rice patch and brought in one\r\nload. Then I went for another, and after I filled the trowsers, I\r\nconcluded that I'd walk down toward the shore and return by that route.\r\nAs I went along by the edge of the rice patch about sunset, I saw a\r\nfootprint, just as Crusoe did, but I didn't study it long, for presently\r\nits owner appeared. He was a big savage, and black as night, and not in\r\nthe least peaceful. Indeed he seemed very angry with me for some reason,\r\nfor he came running toward me, jabbering in his strange language and\r\nsetting his dog on me. I ran as fast as I could toward that piece of\r\nwoods over beyond the rice swamp--more than a mile away from here, you\r\nremember, and on the other side of the island. I had a good start, but\r\nit was a close shave. As I approached the woods I picked out the tree I\r\nmeant to climb, and when I got to it I went up faster than I ever\r\nclimbed before, for the big ugly dog was close behind me. He jumped up\r\nafter me, but I drew up my leg and he missed the foot he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I was tired, and was awfully out of breath; but I thought I had only to\r\nwait until the big negro should come up--I could see him coming. Then I\r\nwould argue the matter with him and get him to be reasonable and call\r\noff his dog. You see I took him for a negro, and didn't suspect that he\r\nwas a savage. I soon found out my mistake, however, for when he came up\r\nand began swearing at me--I'm sure it was swearing, though, of course, I\r\ncouldn't understand a word of it--I found that he talked Savage and\r\ndidn't understand a word of English.\r\n\r\n\"I was in a fix. My tree was about a mile and a half from camp, even if\r\nyou measure the distance in a bee line, so there was no use in shouting\r\nfor assistance. There stood the raving savage jabbering at me, and\r\nthreatening me with his club; and, worse still, there stood his dog at\r\nthe foot of the tree waiting for a dish of Charley Black for supper. I\r\nreasoned with the savage, but he didn't understand me any more than I\r\nunderstood him. The more I talked the madder he got. Then I remembered\r\nhaving read somewhere something about the 'eloquent language' of\r\ngestures, signs, and all that, which all human beings are supposed to\r\nunderstand, so I tried that awhile. I shrugged my shoulders, waved my\r\nhands about, motioned to him to call off his dog and go home, and did\r\nother things of the sort; but it wasn't of the least use. That savage\r\npersisted in misunderstanding me, and his dog got madder and madder.\r\nFinally, just to see if the benighted idiot could understand sign\r\nlanguage at all, I put my thumb to my nose and twiddled my fingers at\r\nhim, at the same time shaking my other fist. He understood that, and\r\ntook further offence at it. In his rage he tried to climb my tree to get\r\nat me, but he was a rather clumsy climber and made little head-way. When\r\nhe got within reach I struck him a sudden blow with your trowsers, Jack,\r\nwhich, being filled chock full of rice, made a pretty good club. He\r\ndropped like a shot squirrel, and his dog, thinking that I had fallen,\r\nmade a rush for him. For a moment I flattered myself that now I should\r\nget away while the savage and the dog were explaining matters to each\r\nother; but in that I was disappointed. The dog found out his mistake\r\ninstantly, and the savage got up, madder than ever. It was getting dark\r\nby that time, but the savage thought he would have a game of bat and\r\nball with me while the light lasted, anyhow, so he took good aim and\r\nthrew his club at me. I caught it a sharp blow with your trowsers, and\r\nknocked it back to him. He threw again with the same result. The third\r\nthrow went wide of the mark, and so I missed, but it didn't matter, for\r\nthere was no catching out to be done in that game--I suppose the savage\r\ndon't understand the rules of bat and ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELOQUENT LANGUAGE OF GESTURE.]\r\n\r\n\"Finally, after he had thrown a good many times, his club lodged in the\r\ntree, and I climbed up and got it. It was a good stout club--there it\r\nlies by the fire--and I thought I might have use for it, so I didn't\r\nthrow it back at the savage's head, as I at first intended, but kept it\r\nfor future use.\r\n\r\n\"Night came on and the savage seated himself to watch me. He kept very\r\nquiet, and made his dog stop growling and snarling. At first I didn't\r\nunderstand this. I began to think that he was going to offer me terms,\r\nbut he didn't. At last I saw what he was at. He was waiting for me to\r\nfall asleep and drop down!\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing for it but to keep awake, and as it was very cold I\r\nhad to climb about a little to keep myself comfortable, and that kept me\r\nme from falling asleep.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of it all was that I could see the big fire you fellows made,\r\nand knew what anxiety you were suffering. I sat there in the dark, hour\r\nafter hour, worrying and wondering if the daylight had forgotten to\r\ncome, and it was an awful time. The rain came on at last, and I was\r\nquickly wet through. The savage couldn't sit long on the ground when the\r\nfloods came, so he got up and moved uneasily about, but he wouldn't go\r\naway. His persistence was 'worthy of a better cause.' After a little\r\nwhile he began to collect bushes to make himself a shelter, I suppose,\r\nor to sit on, or stand on--I don't know what. It was slow work in the\r\ndark, and he had to go away some little distance to get what he wanted.\r\nWhile he was away on one of these little trips an idea occurred to me,\r\nbut as he was already on his way back I could not act upon it at once,\r\nso I sat still and waited. He went away again, fifty or seventy-five\r\nyards into the woods--I could tell by the noise he made breaking bushes.\r\nThen I tried my plan. Climbing down to the lowest limb of the tree, I\r\ncould see the dog, dark as it was, standing ready to receive me.\r\nGrasping the club in my right hand, I dropped a pair of trowsers full of\r\nrice. The dog, mistaking the bundle for me, was on it in an instant, and\r\nthe next instant I was on him. I dropped on him purposely, and luckily\r\nmy left foot struck his neck. Of course I could not hold him long in\r\nthat way, but still it gave me a moment's advantage, and during that\r\nmoment I managed to deal the brute two or three blows over the head\r\nwhich, I think, must have crushed his skull. At any rate he grew limber\r\nunder me and never uttered a sound. Hurriedly picking up the trowsers\r\nand swinging them around my neck, I was about to run when Mr. Savage\r\ncame running out of the woods. I still had the club in my hand, and\r\nquick as lightning I struck him with it and took to my heels. How badly\r\nI hurt him I don't know, but not so badly as could have been wished, for\r\nhe paused only for a few seconds. Then he gave chase. I ran with all my\r\nmight, with him just behind. Presently I struck something with my\r\nfoot--a grape-vine I suppose--and came very near to falling, but managed\r\nto save myself. Mr. Savage Thursday was not so lucky. He struck the vine\r\nfairly and came down like a big tree trunk. For a second he uttered no\r\nsound. Then I could hear him swearing in Savage, but by this time I was\r\nfifty yards ahead of him, and by the time that he decided whether to\r\nresume the chase or not I was too far away to inquire what his decision\r\nwas. It was so dark that if he had followed he couldn't have found me,\r\nso I slackened my pace, and not long afterward dropped into a walk,\r\nlistening occasionally to hear if he was coming. Hearing nothing, I\r\nplodded on. I didn't know just where I was, so I thought my best plan\r\nwas to keep straight on until I struck the shore. I passed a group of\r\nhuts about a mile from my tree, and I suppose the savages live there, as\r\nI heard dogs barking, but I didn't stop to inquire. Finally I came to\r\nthe beach, and, believing that I was more than half way round the\r\nisland, I turned to the right and followed the shore till I got to camp.\r\nThere, that's the whole story of the strange adventures of Master\r\nCharles Black, of his exploration of Bee Island, his encounter with the\r\nsavage, and his fortunate escape and return to his companions. How did\r\nyou hurt your foot, Ned?\"\r\n\r\nNed, who had risen and was limping about the fire, explained his mishap,\r\nand in their turn he and Jack told Charley of the events of the night as\r\nseen from their point of view. Their story was less exciting than\r\nCharley's, but he was deeply interested in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nON GUARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who in the world can Charley's 'savages' be, Ned?\" asked Jack, when the\r\nstory was finished.\r\n\r\n\"Negro squatters,\" answered Ned; \"I didn't think there were any on Bee\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by negro squatters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, negroes who, instead of hiring themselves out or renting land,\r\nhave simply squatted on the island, cultivating little patches, and\r\nliving by hunting and fishing. There are a good many on plantations that\r\nhaven't been cultivated since the war. You see, when the war ended there\r\nwere many men who had large bodies of land--some of them owning half a\r\ndozen big plantations--but with very little capital. They have not been\r\nable, for want of money, to resume the cultivation of all their\r\nabandoned plantations, so there are many large tracts still lying idle\r\nand unoccupied, and some of the negroes, not caring to hire as hands, or\r\nto rent land, have squatted here and there. They are generally the worst\r\nof the negroes; men without thrift, and almost untouched by\r\ncivilization. They prefer a wild life, and live by fishing, hunting, and\r\nstealing from choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I say,\" said Charley, \"my savage wasn't a tame negro at all. He\r\ncouldn't speak English I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more can many others of the old sea-island and rice-field negroes.\r\nThey talk a jargon which only themselves and the old-time overseers ever\r\nunderstood. The fact is that many of them really were savages before the\r\nwar,--untamed Guinea savages. They or their parents were brought here\r\nfrom Africa, and they lived all their lives here on these coast\r\nplantations, rarely seeing a white person except their overseers, and\r\nlearning scarcely any thing of civilized life. They were not at all like\r\nthe negroes up in Aiken, and all over the South for that matter. They\r\nwere simply savages who had learned to work under an overseer, and when\r\nthe war ended the worst of them relapsed into the ways of savage life\r\ninstead of trying to improve themselves as the negroes everywhere else\r\ndid. They hadn't learned enough to want to be civilized.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what did that fellow get after Charley for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we've been robbing their rice field without knowing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think of that. I thought the rice was wild--self-seeded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably it is,\" answered Ned, \"but they regard it as theirs for all\r\nthat, just as they think this island is theirs, although it belongs to\r\nmy uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I know who stole our provisions,\" said Charley. \"But I say, boys,\r\nwhat's to be done? Suppose the savages should attack us here?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may do that,\" answered Ned, \"though I don't think it likely. They\r\nwant us away; perhaps, but they chiefly want us to let them and their\r\nrice alone, and now that we know that it's theirs by some sort of right,\r\nwe'll let it alone and get on with what we have on hand. The main thing\r\nnow is to build our boat. We must get on as fast as we can with that.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Jack. \"That must be the first thing thought of, but\r\nstill it seems to me we should do something for our own defence. You\r\nsee, Ned, if they should attack us, we are helpless. We haven't a thing\r\nto defend ourselves with, now that the gun is gone, and it isn't right\r\nto trust too much to those people's good-nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good many things; I don't know exactly what will be best as yet, but\r\nwe must think it out while we work on the boat. Then we can compare\r\nnotes and do whatever is best. We'll work on the boat until dinner-time,\r\nand then give the afternoon to our defences. Perhaps we can make so good\r\na beginning that we needn't spend more than an hour or two each day on\r\nthat work after to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Ned; \"now let's get to work on the boat.\"\r\n\r\nWith a will the three boys set to work. The stem- and stern-posts of the\r\nnew boat were securely fastened to the keel, and the difficult task of\r\nsetting up the ribs was begun. These ribs were so broken that it\r\nrequired not a little planning and contriving to make them answer the\r\npurpose; but Jack was very ingenious, and under his direction Ned and\r\nCharley managed to do some very clever splicing and bracing, while Jack\r\nhimself dealt with the most difficult problems.\r\n\r\nBy mid-day about half the ribs were in their place.\r\n\r\n\"We can begin to see the shape of our new boat,\" said Ned, \"and I'm not\r\nsure she isn't going to be prettier than the old _Red Bird_.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Jack, \"what are we to name her?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Phoenix,\" suggested Charley; then he added: \"No that won't do,\r\nbecause it isn't a case of rising from ashes. The _Red Bird_ wasn't\r\nburned.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Ned, \"that would be very absurd. Suppose we call her\r\nSea-Gull, because she came to us--in her timbers at least--from the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better call her 'axe, hatchet, and hunting-knife,'\" said Jack, \"because\r\nwe are making her with those tools. But if we must be poetical and\r\nsuggestive, why not call her Aphrodite? She, like that fabled goddess,\r\nis sprung from the foam of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Aphrodite_ it is,\" shouted Jack's companions, and Charley added:\r\n\r\n\"You're the most classical and poetic youth of the party, Jack, if you\r\ndo pretend to sneer at us for our sentimental fancy for an appropriate\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Jack, \"you're welcome to think so; but just now I\r\nwant my dinner worse than any thing else, and that isn't a mere\r\nsentiment I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nDinner over, the preparations for defence were begun.\r\n\r\n\"What plan have you thought of, Jack?\" Charley asked.\r\n\r\n\"Let me hear from you and Ned first,\" answered Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've thought of earthworks,\" said Charley; \"they say they are the\r\nbest fortifications.\"\r\n\r\n\"Against cannon, yes,\" said Ned; \"but it's only because cannon can't\r\nbatter them down as they can masonry. Our problem is a very different\r\none, because our savages haven't any cannon. What we have got to do is\r\nnot to make fortifications that can't be battered down by artillery, but\r\nto fence ourselves in in some way so that the negro squatters can't get\r\nat us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's your idea for that?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"A stockade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Details?\" queried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"My notion is,\" answered Ned, \"to set a line of stockade around the\r\ncamp, running it out into the water on each side, making a big 'C' of\r\nit. If we make it ten feet high and slope it outward, it will puzzle the\r\nsquatters to get over it, and from the inside we can beat them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we make the stockade?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Why, by digging a trench first, and setting timbers in it, sloping them\r\nat the proper angle, and filling in with earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't a strong man pull a timber down by jumping up and hanging\r\nto it with his hands?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, if each timber stood alone,\" said Ned, \"but we'll set a row\r\nof them in the ditch, and then roll a log in behind them before filling\r\nup. Then we'll set another row and roll in another log, and so on. Then,\r\nin order to pull down a post it will be necessary to lift the whole of\r\nthe log that is behind it, together with all the earth that lies on top\r\nof the log, and that is more than any half dozen men can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an excellent idea,\" said Jack, after thinking awhile, \"but the\r\njob is too big to be completed to-day. We'd better follow my plan first,\r\nand make the stockade hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"To build a sort of wall of timber around the camp. It isn't half so\r\ngood as a stockade, because of course it is easily climbed over; but it\r\nis better than nothing, and will do for one night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see,\" said Charley, \"that we can build a timber wall half\r\nso quickly as we can make the stockade. To do it we have got to cut\r\nenough logs to make a pile all around the camp, and that will take ten\r\ntimes as many logs as it will to make the stockade.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Jack, \"and, besides, small timbers, five or six\r\ninches in diameter, will do as well for the stockade as big logs, and in\r\nthe present state of our axe that is a consideration not to be despised.\r\nI surrender. Ned's plan is by odds the best one. Let's get to work at\r\nit, and if we don't finish it to-day, we'll patch up the deficiency in\r\nsome way. Luckily we have digging tools.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil of the coast and islands of South Carolina is a light\r\nvegetable mould, mixed with sand, and below it there is sand only. There\r\nare no rocks, no stones, no pebbles even, and no stiff clay; and all\r\nthis was greatly in the boys' favor. The trench grew very rapidly as\r\nthey worked. Jack and Ned dug, while Charley, who was more expert with\r\nthe axe than either of his companions, cut down small trees and trimmed\r\nthem into shape for the stockade, making each about fourteen feet long,\r\nso that when set in the ditch it would project about ten feet above\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe digging of the ditch was the smallest part of the task. Its length,\r\nin order to enclose the hut, the well, and the boat, had to be about one\r\nhundred and fifty feet, so that a great many sticks of timber were\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"We must set them about six inches apart,\" said Jack, \"so as to use as\r\nfew as we can at first. If necessary, we can fill in the gaps afterward;\r\nbut a man can't get through a six-inch crack, and by setting them in\r\nthat way each post, with its half of the two cracks, will occupy about a\r\nfoot of space.\"\r\n\r\nBut to cut a hundred and fifty pieces of timber with a dull axe was no\r\nsmall job, and when night came on the boys had only twenty-five of them\r\nset up in their places, while as many more were ready for use. This was\r\ndiscouraging, and in their weariness Ned and Charley felt very much\r\ndisheartened indeed. Jack alone kept his spirits up.\r\n\r\n\"It's very good work so far as it goes,\" he said, looking at the line of\r\ntimbers all leaning outward from the camp, \"and when we get it done it\r\nwill puzzle all the squatters in South Carolina to take our fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if we ever do get it done,\" said Charley, despondently.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Charley,\" said Jack, \"none of that. We've been in a tighter place\r\nthan this, and you especially ought not to be downhearted. You're ever\r\nso much better off than you were this time last night, when that darkey\r\nhad you treed; and you're better off now than Ned is, with his game\r\nfoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow,\" said Charley, looking at Ned as he limped into the hut\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" continued Jack, \"we're tired out, and so things look blue\r\nto us, but they'll look better in the morning. You see we got no sleep\r\nlast night, besides wearing ourselves out with anxiety and excitement,\r\nand we have worked like convicts all day. We'll feel better and brighter\r\nafter we get some sleep, and things that look gloomy and discouraging\r\nnow will look bright and hopeful enough to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Ned, coming out of the hut again, \"and it would be\r\nmuch better for us if we could quit work right now, and sleep for ten\r\nhours without waking, but we can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Charley, who was utterly worn out.\r\n\r\n\"Because we've some more work to do that must be done before we sleep,\"\r\nanswered Ned. \"What we have done for defence is of no good at all as it\r\nstands. We must have a barrier around the camp to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall we make one?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"With brush. We have plenty of it already cut in the shape of the tree\r\ntops we've trimmed off in getting our stockade poles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brush won't make a very good defence,\" muttered Charley.\r\n\r\n\"No, but it will be much better than no defence at all,\" replied Ned.\r\n\"It isn't easy to climb over a well-packed brush pile, particularly if\r\nthe brush is so laid that all the branches point outward, and that's the\r\nway we'll lay it. It won't take long to make a wall of that kind, and we\r\ncan remove it little by little, as we set the poles hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan commended itself to Jack, and Charley submitted. Poor fellow,\r\nhe was too weary to take any active interest even in plans for defence.\r\nThe brushwood was brought and carefully placed in position. It was not\r\nsufficient to make a wall all the way around, but only a small gap was\r\nleft near the water.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we cut more brush to-night, Jack?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think we needn't. When we go to setting poles to-morrow, the\r\nbrush we remove will do to close the gap with, and for one night we can\r\nwatch so small an opening. We need rest and sleep now more than any\r\nthing else. You and Charley lie down. I'm the freshest one of the party,\r\nI think, and so I'll stand guard for a good while before calling either\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand guard?\" asked Ned; \"what for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it won't do at all for all three to sleep at once. We might be\r\nattacked while asleep. If there were no danger of that we needn't have\r\nthought of a stockade at all.\"\r\n\r\nSleepy and tired as Ned and Charley were, they recognized the necessity\r\nfor this watchfulness. It was very hard for the three weary fellows to\r\ntake their turns at standing guard that night, but they did their duty.\r\nJack took a long turn first, and Ned followed him, so that Charley got a\r\ngood sleep of several hours, and was much refreshed before his period of\r\nwatching began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nA NEW DANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night brought its alarms with it. Every noise in the woods round\r\nabout startled the alert sentinel, and there always are noises at night,\r\nnot only in the woods but in houses also, as we all find out, when for\r\nany reason we are awake and on the alert. It seemed to each of the boys\r\nduring this night, that there never were so many sounds which could not\r\nbe explained: crackling noises, like those which are produced by the\r\nbreaking of dry sticks under foot; sounds of footsteps, and of hard\r\nbreathing; a thousand different sounds, in short, each of which seemed\r\nfor the time being surely to indicate the stealthy approach of some foe.\r\n\r\nMorning came at last, however, and no ill had befallen the camp. It was\r\nvoted at breakfast that this day should be devoted exclusively to\r\nfortification, security being deemed of more pressing importance than\r\nescape from the island.\r\n\r\nBy steady persistence the work was carried forward until the line of\r\ntall, leaning pickets was more than half-way round the camp. This at\r\nleast reduced the space to be watched through the night to less than\r\nhalf its former length, and as the night passed quietly with no sign of\r\nan enemy about, it was unanimously resolved, the next morning, that\r\nSunday should be kept as a day of rest, the opinion being that the\r\ncompletion of the stockade could not now be called a work of necessity.\r\n\r\nDuring Sunday night, however, the boys had reason to modify this opinion\r\nsomewhat. About two o'clock Ned, who was on guard at the time, armed\r\nwith a big club, awoke his companions, saying, in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Get up, quick! There's somebody about.\"\r\n\r\nThe two sleepers sprang to their feet quickly, and, seizing their clubs,\r\njoined Ned outside the hut.\r\n\r\nBy way of precaution the boys had cut a considerable number of short,\r\nthick, and very heavy clubs, which could be made to serve a good\r\npurpose as missiles. Thrown with violence from the hand they were\r\nlikely to be of much greater service than stones or brickbats would have\r\nbeen, if such things had been at hand. Armed with these clubs the boys\r\npeered and listened. For a while they heard nothing. Then a low growl\r\ncame from the bushes, and the sound of a sharp blow followed it\r\nimmediately. Evidently one of the squatters was sneaking around the\r\ncamp, and when his dog growled he struck it to secure silence.\r\n\r\nThe boys waited a long time but heard nothing more. Finally, in a low\r\nwhisper, Ned said:\r\n\r\n\"There can't be more than one of them here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not,\" answered Jack, \"but let's be quiet and see what he\r\nwants.\"\r\n\r\nAll became still again, and as the boys from their hiding-place could\r\nnot be seen by any one in the bushes, the prowler had every reason to\r\nsuppose that they were asleep. After perhaps an hour's waiting, Jack\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"I see him; he is crawling on his stomach to the fire. H--sh! let's see\r\nwhat he wants.\"\r\n\r\nThe man could be seen only in dim outline until he reached the fire,\r\nand, taking a smouldering brand, blew it to quicken its burning. The\r\nlight thus created revealed his face, and the sight was not a pleasant\r\none to the boys. They saw in their visitor as ugly and forbidding a\r\nspecimen of untamed humanity as one often meets. He was a negro of the\r\nsmall, ugly, tough-looking variety, seen nowhere in this country except\r\non the South Carolina and Georgia coast. About five feet two inches\r\nhigh, he had a small, flat head, large, muscular arms and body, short\r\nlegs, and no clothing except a sort of sack with head- and arm-holes in\r\nit, worn as a shirt. His brow was so low and retreating, that his eyes\r\nseemed to project beyond it. His nose was flattened out as if it had\r\ntried to spread itself evenly all over his face. His thick lips were too\r\nshort to cover his big teeth, and it is hardly necessary to add that he\r\nlooked far less like a rational human being than like some wild animal.\r\n\r\nWhen he had satisfied himself that his brand was burning, he crept a few\r\npaces further, and his purpose was revealed. He meant to set fire to the\r\npile of plank that the boat was to be built of.\r\n\r\n\"Quick now,\" said Jack, \"give him a volley of clubs and then charge!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GIVE HIM A VOLLEY AND THEN CHARGE!\"]\r\n\r\nIt was no sooner said than done. Standing at less than twenty feet\r\ndistance, the boys threw one club each at the intruder, and then,\r\nsnatching other clubs, one in each hand, rushed upon him. Rising, he\r\nknocked Jack down, but was brought to his own knees by Charley's club.\r\nAt that moment the man's dog, a surly-looking brute, seized Charley, and\r\nit required the combined efforts of all three boys--for Jack was up\r\nagain in an instant--to beat the creature off. While they were engaged\r\nin this, the dog's master, finding himself outnumbered and overmatched,\r\ntook to his heels and the camp was clear, for the dog quickly followed,\r\nhowling with pain.\r\n\r\n\"Are you much hurt, Charley?\" was the first question asked when the\r\nenemy's retreat left the boys free to think of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I'm pretty severely bitten,\" was the reply, \"but luckily it's in the\r\nfleshy part of my thigh, and the flesh isn't torn. One of you must have\r\nstruck very quickly, or I shouldn't have got off so easily. See,\" he\r\ncontinued, when the fire had been stirred into a blaze, \"the brute\r\nburied his teeth, but let go again without shaking me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him jump at you, and tried to hit him before he got hold,\"\r\nsaid Ned. \"I must have struck him just as he seized you--half a second\r\ntoo late to save you entirely, but I hit him fairly on the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he had to let go of me to howl,\" said Charley, who, in spite of his\r\npain, was in good spirits after the exciting encounter. \"By the way, are\r\nyou hurt, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've an earache,\" said Jack, turning his head and showing an inflamed\r\nand swollen ear; \"but I'm glad that fellow didn't hit me fairly in the\r\nface, as he meant to do. It would have settled the question of\r\nphotographs for me for all time, I think. Why, if I had caught that blow\r\non the face my nose would have been distributed over the rest of my\r\ncountenance as evenly as his is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look solemn, Ned,\" said Charley; \"are you hurt too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, out with your thought then. What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that we're fairly in for it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"In for what?\"\r\n\r\n\"War.\"\r\n\r\n\"War?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You don't suppose we're going to have peace with the squatters\r\nnow, do you? They'll attack us in force as sure as sunrise and sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's my opinion that one of them, at least, has got as much of us\r\nas he wants,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" answered Ned; \"but now he'll want to give us something,\r\nby way of returning the compliment. He'll bring all his friends with him\r\nnext time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see what we've done that they should interfere with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't you? Well, that's because you don't look at the matter with\r\ntheir eyes. You see, when we first came here they didn't object. They\r\ntook a fancy to our coffee and flour and bacon, and the rest of it, and\r\nhelped themselves, but they didn't in the least object to us or our\r\npresence. Having got all we had for them to steal, they let us alone.\r\nBut when they found that we were getting rice out of what they called\r\ntheir field, it put a new face on the matter, and they objected. You\r\nbaffled the one that got after you, and he hurt himself trying to catch\r\nyou. That was another offence on our part, and so this fellow that was\r\nhere to-night determined to get even with us by burning us out. He has\r\nbeen pretty badly whipped, and he isn't likely to forget it. He'll bring\r\nall his friends here and we must take care of ourselves, for we shan't\r\nget any coddling, I can assure you, if we fall into their hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Ned,\" said Jack; \"and now we must really take care of\r\nourselves. It's nearly morning, and we may as well get breakfast at once\r\nand get an early start. We must be ready to receive those fellows when\r\nthey come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA CAMP-FACTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast was finished before daylight that morning, and when it was\r\nover the three companions resumed work upon their fortification. Ned\r\nstopped long enough to catch some shrimps for dinner, but with that\r\nexception there was no break at all in the morning's work, and\r\ndinner-time found the boys tired as well as hungry. The afternoon was\r\nspent quite as industriously, and when night came the fort, though still\r\nincomplete, was well advanced toward security.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Ned, when supper-time came, \"we have had rather too much of\r\nshrimps, I think, and of oysters too. I'm going out with the net\r\nto-night to catch some fish for to-morrow. What do you two propose to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make some more clubs,\" said Charley. \"We've something\r\nlike a fort now, and the next thing is to provide an abundance of\r\nammunition.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Ned, \"why can't we make some better arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what sort?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, bows and arrows, for example. We can make arrow-heads out of some\r\nof our copper bolts, and they are weapons not to be despised--what are\r\nyou smiling at, Charley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nothing; I was only wondering what good bows and arrows would do\r\nwithout bowstrings.\"\r\n\r\nNed's countenance fell; then he joined in the smile of his companions,\r\nand admitted that his little plan had been very imperfectly worked out\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\n\"I might make some blow-guns out of the canes,\" he said, \"but they're\r\nnot worth making. I have killed birds with them, but I've tried them\r\nthoroughly and they won't shoot hard enough to drive an arrow-head half\r\nan inch into a pine plank; so they would be worthless for our purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, \"I think we may make up our minds that we've got to\r\nget on with no better weapons than our clubs for general use, with the\r\naxe, hatchet, and digging tools to fall back upon as a last resort. To\r\nuse such things means to kill, and of course we don't want to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not. We only want to protect ourselves and make these\r\nsquatters let us alone. We don't want to do the poor creatures any\r\nunnecessary harm.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Ned took the net and went away in search of fish. When he\r\nhad gone Jack said:\r\n\r\n\"Charley, let's build a platform to fight from.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite understand you,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see the stockade is ten feet high, and slopes outward, and so\r\nit won't be easy for anybody to scale it; but it isn't impossible,\r\nparticularly if one has time to put up a pole or two to climb on. My\r\nnotion is that we must be prepared to interfere with anybody who tries\r\nto do that. We must build a sort of platform all around inside the\r\nstockade, about six feet from the ground; it needn't be any thing more\r\nthan a row of poles laid against the stockade and supported by some\r\nforked stakes. We can then stand up on these poles and look over the top\r\nof the stockade. If anybody tries to climb up, we can beat him back\r\nfrom there, while if we were on the ground inside here, we should be\r\nnearly helpless. It won't take you and me more than half an hour or so\r\nto rig the thing up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" replied Charley; \"and we need the platform more\r\nto-night than we shall at any time hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because if those fellows mean to attack us they will do so at once. If\r\nwe escape to-night we're not likely to be attacked at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" answered Jack. \"On the contrary, I think\r\nthey'll let us alone to-night, because they'll expect us to be on the\r\nlookout for them. They have no special fancy for getting their heads\r\nbroken, and when they come they will try to take us by surprise. At\r\nleast that's my notion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think they are likely to attack us later this week or next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at any time except to-night. They will wait for us to make up our\r\nminds that they aren't coming at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--that _fabula docet_ that we mustn't make up our minds in that\r\ndirection at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. We must be as alert two weeks hence as we are now--if we're\r\nhere so long. But come, let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\nCutting some forked stakes, which did not need to be driven far into the\r\nground, because they were to be leant toward the sloping stockade, the\r\nboys placed them in position, and laid poles from one to another until\r\nthe line stretched all the way around the enclosure. It was easy to walk\r\nupon these poles all the way around, and when standing upon them the\r\nboys' shoulders were above the top of the stockade.\r\n\r\nNear the water, on each side, an entrance to the stockade had been made,\r\nand a movable piece of timber, with a notch in it and a brace behind,\r\nserved to close each of these gates; and when thus closed and fastened\r\nfrom the inside, the gates were as secure as any other part of the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nJack's prediction that the enemy would not appear on Monday night was\r\nverified. The whole of that week, indeed, was passed in complete\r\nquietude.\r\n\r\nHaving made their fortress reasonably secure, the boys resumed work upon\r\nthe boat on Monday and continued it throughout the week; but they gave\r\nonly one half of each day to that task, devoting the other half to the\r\nwork of strengthening their fort. The posts, as we know, were originally\r\nset six inches apart for the sake of hurrying the work, but this was not\r\nintended to be a permanent arrangement. As fast as they could the boys\r\nfilled up the spaces thus left, and by Saturday night the fort was\r\ncomplete, so that its inmates felt entirely confident of their ability\r\nto beat off any attack the negro squatters might choose to make.\r\n\r\nMeantime the boat approached completion, though there was, perhaps, a\r\nweek's work, or a little less, still to be done upon her.\r\n\r\n\"We must caulk her seams,\" said Ned on Sunday, as the boys sat chatting\r\nround their fire, \"with moss instead of oakum, and then we'll coat her\r\nall over with pitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" answered Charley, \"we've got to make the pitch. Do you\r\nknow how, Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very well,\" replied Ned, \"but I think we can make out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Jack; \"I've seen tar made in the North Carolina tar\r\ncountry, and pitch is only boiled tar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, you shall superintend that job,\" said Ned; \"you know\r\nthat was our bargain, to make each fellow manage the things he\r\nunderstood best.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better make a lot of salt, then, right away, beginning to-morrow\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? You don't use salt in making pitch, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but I shall want the big kettle to boil the tar in, and it won't be\r\nfit for use as a salt kettle after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must cook up all our rice too,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"No, we needn't,\" said Ned; \"it would spoil if we did, and we can cook\r\nit, as we need it, in the coffee-pot.\"\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning these preparations were begun. Charley got his\r\nsalt factory at work, Ned worked at the boat, and Jack made preparations\r\nfor tar-burning. He began by digging a pit about four feet square and\r\ntwo feet deep. Then--at a distance of about a foot--he dug another pit\r\nabout three feet square and four feet deep. He packed the wall of earth\r\nthat separated the two pits as firmly as he could, and then, cutting a\r\nlong joint of cane for a tar pipe, he passed it through this wall, from\r\na point exactly at the bottom of the shallow pit. He inclined it\r\ndownward a little, so that the tar might easily run though it and fall\r\ninto the deeper pit.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this part of his work, Jack went into the woods near the\r\ncamp and prepared a large quantity of \"fat\" pine for burning. Piling\r\nthis in the shallow pit, and heaping it two or three feet above the\r\nlevel ground, he took the shovel and covered the pile with earth to a\r\ndepth of a foot or more, leaving a single opening through which he could\r\nset fire to the mass. His object was, by smothering the flames in this\r\nway, to make the fat, resinous pine burn slowly, creating a roasting\r\nheat under the earth, and thus, as it were, melting the tar out of the\r\npine. If he had not covered the wood with earth, it would have blazed up\r\nand burned to smoke, resin and all, making no tar at all.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready the pile was set on fire, and as soon as it had\r\ncaught well, Jack covered the single opening with earth, and the mound\r\nsmoked like a volcano. Pretty soon a little stream of smoking-hot tar\r\nbegan trickling through the cane-tube into the deep pit.\r\n\r\nNight had now come on, and the smoke from the tar-kiln, catching the\r\nlight from the camp-fire, glowed with a peculiar red color, and gave a\r\npicturesque air of strangeness to the camp.\r\n\r\n\"You've started a young volcano, Jack,\" said Charley, as he looked at\r\nthe smoking mound.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. An improvement on Crusoe,\" said Ned; \"he had no volcano on his\r\nisland. But what a quantity of smoke the thing does make. It looks as if\r\nmore material came out of the mound in that way than you put into it in\r\nthe shape of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and so a gallon of water will fill a big room if you make it into\r\nsteam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is smoke anyhow?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"It is composed of several things,\" answered Ned, \"but chiefly of\r\ncarbon. Indeed, all that you can see in smoke is carbon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why doesn't it burn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would if it were kept in the fire long enough; but the light vapors\r\nthat rise from the fire carry the particles of carbon with them, and so\r\nthey get out of the fire before they are burned. The smoke is simply so\r\nmuch wasted fuel, and many plans have been made to save it in factories\r\nwhere the cost of fuel is great.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a big waste in making tar, then,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Not half so much as you think,\" said Jack. \"They don't waste the smoke\r\nup in the North Carolina tar country.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do they burn it?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't burn it, but they catch it and sell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they have wire screens stretched over the tar-kilns, and as the\r\nsmoke strikes them the fine particles of carbon stick to them. I have\r\nseen masses of them hanging down many inches from the screens, and very\r\npretty they are too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do they do with the stuff?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Sell it. It is called lamp-black, and it brings a pretty good price.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is close economy, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it is frequently by just such 'margins' as that that\r\nmanufacturing becomes profitable. It is a very poor and desolate-looking\r\ncountry up there in the tar-making districts, and I remember hearing a\r\nman say once, as we passed through it: 'This is the country where they\r\nwaste nothing; they bark the trees to get resin: they distil the resin\r\nand make turpentine; what's left is rosin; when the trees die they burn\r\nthem to make tar, catch the smoke for lamp-black, and there aren't any\r\nashes.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA NIGHT OF ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tar flowed freely during Monday night and Tuesday, and by the time\r\nthat Tuesday's labors were finished, there was enough in the deep vat to\r\nmake all the pitch that was required. The salt-making was finished too,\r\nand the big kettle was ready for use the next day in boiling the tar to\r\nmake pitch of it.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening Ned determined to go fishing, as he did nearly every\r\nnight when the tide was at a proper stage. He had learned now the spots\r\nmost frequented by the mullets, and usually succeeded in bringing back a\r\ngood supply of them to camp. The boys had grown very tired indeed of\r\ntheir restricted diet. For three weeks now they had not tasted meat of\r\nany kind--for they never repeated their snake supper,--but had lived on\r\nfish, shrimps, oysters, and a few crabs; and being without bacon or any\r\nother kind of fat with which to fry their fish, they could not make an\r\nappearance of variety by changing the way of cooking them. They had to\r\neat every thing boiled, or roasted, or broiled on the coals, and in the\r\nabsence of butter and other seasoning for broiled fish, the roast,\r\nbaked, broiled, and boiled all tasted alike. They had lost their relish\r\nfor such food as they could get, but having nothing else they were\r\nforced to eat it.\r\n\r\nOn this Tuesday night Ned remained away from camp longer than usual, and\r\nat about eleven o'clock Charley went to bed, Jack mounting guard. About\r\nan hour later Jack waked Charley, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I'm uneasy about Ned, Charley. It must be midnight and he hasn't come\r\nin yet.\"\r\n\r\nCharley sprang up quickly, and the two looked and listened. Finally it\r\nwas decided that as Charley was less able to run than Jack--because of\r\nthe dog-bite, which had not yet entirely healed,--he should remain on\r\nguard while Jack should go out in search of Ned.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Jack came back, running as quietly as he could, and\r\nhastily pushed through the eastern gate. Fastening this, he exclaimed\r\nin an excited way:\r\n\r\n\"The squatters are all around us, and I'm afraid they've captured Ned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Where are they? Tell me all about it, quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much about it myself,\" answered Jack. \"I only know that as\r\nI walked down along the shore in the direction that Ned took, I almost\r\nstumbled over one of the squatters. I retreated, of course, and by\r\nkeeping in the bushes and looking and listening, I made out that there\r\nwere at least half a dozen of them about. As I could see nothing, and\r\nhear nothing of Ned, I'm afraid they've caught him. You see they came\r\nright along the shore where he was wading about and fishing, and if they\r\nhadn't caught him, of course he would have run in to give us the alarm.\r\nPoor fellow! I wonder if they'll kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid of worse than that,\" said Charley, solemnly\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they'll flog him. That would be horrible! for my part I'd a\r\ngood deal rather be killed, and I'm sure Ned would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Jack. Then, after a pause, he added:\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what, Charley, we mustn't let that happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How'll we help it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they won't try that till after they've made their attack on the\r\nfort. They'll simply tie Ned, and keep him till they're through with us,\r\nand so we have time to make a diversion in his favor. We've got to give\r\nthem battle outside the fort. If we can drive them off we may find Ned.\r\nWhen he finds what's up he'll let us know where he is quickly enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if he hasn't been carried too far away already,\" said Charley. \"At\r\nany rate, we'll try. Where were the darkies when you saw them?\"\r\n\r\n\"About two hundred yards away, in the woods near the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Now let's remember that we've got to stick together, and\r\nthat our object is to do not as much but as little fighting as\r\nnecessary, and to get past the enemy if we can, and go on down the shore\r\nin search of Ned. We mustn't stop to do any unnecessary fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we'll try first to creep past without any fighting at all,\" said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\nArming themselves with their best clubs the two boys crept out of the\r\neastern gate and made their way as secretly as they could through the\r\nwoods. They saw two of the squatters, but managed to slip past them\r\nwithout discovery, and when they had got well beyond them they made\r\ntheir way rapidly along the beach, calling Ned at the top of their\r\nvoices and listening for his answer. At last they heard a shout in\r\nreply, but it seemed a long way off, and singularly enough it was in the\r\ndirection of the camp. Turning around, they were filled with horror and\r\namazement at what they saw. A great red blaze was shooting up from the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\"They're burning us out!\" exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and they must have Ned there with them. His shout came from that\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's run with all our might. We may get there in time to save\r\nNed at any rate!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran like deer-hounds and were quickly at the burning camp.\r\n\r\nThey encountered three of the negroes just outside the camp, but coming\r\nupon them by surprise they were able to run past and to enter the gate\r\nbefore their enemies could lay hold of them. Once inside they fastened\r\nthe gate log. As they did so and turned they discovered that they had\r\ncaught one of their assailants--a negro boy not older than\r\nthemselves--inside. This lad showed fight, but with two against him he\r\nwas quickly secured, and tied with the boat's anchor rope.\r\n\r\nThen Jack and Charley had time to see the extent of the mischief done.\r\nThe stockade itself was uninjured, and thus far the boat also was safe,\r\nbut the vat of tar was afire, and the bush hut in which the boys slept\r\nhad either caught from the blazing tar or been set on fire by the negro\r\nboy. It was obviously too late to save the hut, even if the boys had\r\nbeen free to work upon it, as they were not, for the danger to the boat,\r\nwhich lay very near the fire and was already scorching, was too great to\r\nbe trifled with. Jack managed to rescue the salt from the hut, and then\r\nhe and Charley began wetting moss and laying it over the boat.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do, Jack,\" said Charley; \"those rascals outside will make\r\ntheir way over the stockade if they aren't watched. Can't you keep the\r\nmoss wet now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll attend to that. You go to the platform at once. If you need\r\nme call out and I'll come.\"\r\n\r\nCharley sprang to the platform, and was none too soon. The negroes\r\noutside, hearing the cries of their imprisoned companion, were already\r\ntrying to make their way within the enclosure. One of them having\r\nclimbed upon the shoulders of another, had taken hold of the top of the\r\nstockade, and in another second would have drawn himself up. In that\r\ncase the boys would have had to encounter him on equal terms, and\r\nperhaps another squatter would have been over the wall by that time.\r\nLuckily the light from the burning tar revealed the situation to Charley\r\nin an instant. Running along the platform to the point of danger, he\r\nrapped the knuckles of the climber with a degree of violence which at\r\nonce ended his climbing. He dropped to the ground as if his hands had\r\nbeen cut off at the wrists, and then Charley began offensive measures.\r\nThrowing his clubs one after another--for a large supply of them had\r\nbeen stored along the platform--he compelled the assailants to beat a\r\nretreat. They threw some sticks at him in return, but he managed to\r\ndodge them, and Jack joining him for a few minutes, the pair fairly\r\ndrove the assailants off. Then Jack returned to his task of protecting\r\nthe boat, while Charley, promenading all the way around the barrier,\r\nkept guard against surprises.\r\n\r\nNo further assault being made, and the fire gradually dying down until\r\nthe boat was no longer in danger, Jack and Charley had time to think of\r\nNed again, and their anxiety was intense.\r\n\r\n\"At least we've got a hostage,\" said Jack, \"and perhaps poor Ned will be\r\nable to arrange for an exchange. At any rate I hope so. There must be\r\nsome of them who can speak English, and, besides, Ned understands their\r\njargon a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll hope for the best,\" said Charley, \"but oughtn't we to make\r\nanother effort to find Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what we can do,\" said Jack. \"They've carried him off by\r\nthis time, and to follow in the dark would be useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's true. Listen! What was that?\"\r\n\r\nJack listened, but could hear nothing.\r\n\r\n\"What did you hear?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I heard Ned shout.\"\r\n\r\nJack gave a loud, long call, and then the two listened again. A shout in\r\nreply was this time distinctly heard.\r\n\r\n\"That's Ned,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jack. \"He's making all the trouble he can, I suppose, to\r\ndelay their march and give us time to catch up. Come, Charley, we _must_\r\nrescue him.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the boys sallied out, this time through the western gate. They ran\r\nalong the shore, stopping occasionally to halloo and to listen for Ned's\r\nreplies, which came promptly now.\r\n\r\n\"They aren't getting on very fast with him,\" said Jack; \"we're gaining\r\non them at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the boys ran. When they made their next pause to shout, they were\r\nastonished to hear Ned cry out, in his natural voice, from no great\r\ndistance:\r\n\r\n\"Is every thing burnt up?\"\r\n\r\nStrangely enough the voice seemed to come from the water on the right,\r\nand both Jack and Charley were bewildered by the fact.\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth are you?\" called Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" answered Ned, \"out here on the oyster reef.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon was near the zenith, and by carefully scanning the sea the boys\r\ncould make out the figure of Ned, standing knee-deep in water, about\r\nfifty yards from shore. What to make of the situation they did not know.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing out there, Ned?\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I'm waiting for the tide to go down. Never mind me, but tell me about\r\nthe fire. Did it burn the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only the tar in the vat and our hut. The boat is safe, and so is\r\nthe stockade.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it catch fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the squatters set it afire while we were out hunting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they been there, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Haven't they had you prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. But don't stand there talking. Go back and take care\r\nof the camp. When the tide goes down I'll return. Hurry now, or those\r\nrascals will get in again and burn the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what in the world----\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that now. Go on to camp. You've no time to lose. I'll make\r\nexplanations when I get there.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity for hurrying back was plain enough, and so, without\r\nfurther delay, Jack and Charley started toward the camp at a brisk\r\ntrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nA CALCULATION OF PROFIT AND LOSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at camp Jack and Charley found every thing as they had\r\nleft it, except that their prisoner was gone. Examination showed that he\r\nhad gnawed the rope with which he had been bound, and thus had set\r\nhimself free.\r\n\r\nAt first the boys were disposed to regard this as a mishap, but a\r\nmoment's reflection convinced them of their error.\r\n\r\n\"Now that we know that Ned is safe,\" said Charley, \"we have no use for\r\nthat rascal. We should have set him free in the morning at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Jack, \"what do you make of Ned's performance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't make it out at all,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been cut off from camp by the squatters and forced to\r\ntake refuge out there on the oyster reef.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the squatters came from the other direction, don't you remember?\r\nAnd, besides, Ned didn't know there had been any of them about until we\r\ntold him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll explain all that for myself,\" said Ned from the outside, \"if\r\nyou'll be good enough to take down the gate log and let me in.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quickly done, and Ned entered, first pushing in the cast net\r\nwell filled with fish. As he straightened himself up a glad \"hurrah!\"\r\ncame from both his companions, who saw in his hands a turtle weighing at\r\nleast twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! Now we shall have a taste of meat again. Where did you get that\r\nfine fellow, Ned?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the oyster reef,\" answered Ned; \"that's how I came to be out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us all about it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there isn't a great deal to tell. When I left camp, I went down\r\nalong the shore to the east and caught a few fish, but not many. Then I\r\ndetermined to try the other side of the camp. I strung my fish on a\r\nlimber switch and came back, intending to leave them here before going\r\non; but as I passed I saw that the gate was closed, so I walked around\r\nwithout bothering you fellows, and went on toward the west. I fished\r\nalong at one place and another, and finally I got to fishing in the\r\nshallow water between the oyster reef and the shore, where the mullets\r\nseemed to be holding a public meeting or something of that sort. The\r\ntide was low then, though it was coming in, and the oyster reef was out\r\nof water. Finding that my switches were full of fish, and being nearer\r\nthe reef than the shore, I thought I'd just take a look over the reef to\r\nsee if I could find a small turtle. I had seen one out there several\r\ndays ago, and my mouth watered so for a piece of meat that the thought\r\nof turtle made me wild. So, swinging my strings of fish over my neck, I\r\ncrept about in the moonlight--for the moon showed a little through the\r\ntrees by that time,--and after a pretty thorough search I spied this\r\nfellow scrambling along over the oyster bed. It seemed, from the slow\r\nprogress he made, that the shells hurt his bare feet as much as they did\r\nmine; but that was probably only in appearance, for when he saw me\r\ncreeping up on him he made better time, and if I hadn't been so bent\r\nupon having some meat for breakfast, he would have got away. As it was I\r\nforgot my bare feet long enough to catch the gentleman. Then I tried to\r\ngo ashore, but the tide had come up and I couldn't. That is to say, I\r\ncouldn't wade ashore, and to swim was to lose my turtle; so I made up my\r\nmind to stick it out till the tide turned. I had to stand in water up to\r\nmy waist at high tide, but I didn't mind that. I wasn't worried till I\r\nsaw the blaze here at camp, and heard you fellows yelling. I answered,\r\nbut you stopped calling, so I supposed it was all right. I waited two or\r\nthree hours longer, till the blaze began to die down. Then you fellows\r\nbegan calling again, and you came to me. You know the rest. I came\r\nashore as soon after you left as the water would let me. Now tell me all\r\nabout matters here. Where's your prisoner?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys soon recounted the adventures of the night.\r\n\r\n\"What is the measure of damage?\" Ned asked when the story was ended.\r\n\r\n\"The hut is destroyed,\" said Charley; \"and the tar,\" added Jack. \"We can\r\nmake another hut in an hour, but the destruction of the tar just as we\r\nwere ready to use it is a more serious matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will delay us a couple of days longer with the boat,\" said Ned,\r\n\"and that's a pity. Let's see, this is Wednesday morning--for it's\r\nnearly daybreak now. If this hadn't happened we might have got away from\r\nhere by next Wednesday,--just four weeks from the day we came. Now,\r\nhowever, we shan't get away before the Friday or Saturday following.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that will be the appointed time,\" said Charley.\r\n\r\n\"The appointed time?\" asked Ned, \"what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you remember? You told Maum Sally we'd be gone a month, and\r\nshe warned you not to stay a day longer than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I forgot that! It will be curious, won't it, if we get away\r\nSaturday? I hadn't the least thought of staying a week when we came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Jack. \"If we had suspected what we were coming to we never\r\nwould have come at all, I imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Charley, doubtfully. \"We came for\r\nadventures, and we've had them, if I know what such things are. And\r\nwe've really had a good deal of fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Ned; \"we couldn't expect to sleep on feather beds,\r\nor to have much luxury of any kind on such an expedition. And, after\r\nall, our little hardships haven't hurt us. My foot is about well now,\r\nand your dog-bite, Charley, is in a fair way to heal. So, if we get away\r\nsafely we're all the better for the trip. It will all seem like fun when\r\nwe get back to school and think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say we've sharpened our wits a trifle too,\" said Jack. \"We've\r\nlearned how to take care of ourselves in the woods, and we shall be a\r\ngood deal quicker and sounder in our thinking for this experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's clear that we are not sufficiently sharpened up yet,\" said\r\nCharley, \"or else some one of us would have seen before this precisely\r\nwhat the fire has done for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Charley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, every grain of rice that we had in the world was in the hut, and\r\nof course it is all burnt up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mischief!\" exclaimed Ned.\r\n\r\n\"That's a calamity,\" added Jack, \"but we must get more to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ned, \"if the squatters haven't gathered it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us meet trouble half way,\" said Jack; \"it will be time enough\r\nto give up the rice when we find that we can't get it. Meantime, let's\r\nhave some turtle steak for breakfast. Then we'll see what is to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the lack of rice and all other substitutes for bread, the\r\nboys enjoyed the broiled turtle more than any thing they had eaten for a\r\nfortnight at least.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they \"scouted\" a little, to make sure that there were\r\nnone of the squatters on their side of the island. Then Charley climbed\r\na tall tree, the plan being that he should watch for squatters while Ned\r\nand Jack should gather rice, so that they might not be surprised at\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nThe rice had been cut, and very little remained of it; but here and\r\nthere a little clump of it was still standing in the grass and bushes\r\naround the patch, and a hard morning's work enabled the boys to secure\r\nenough of these gleanings to last them for ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCHARLEY'S SECRET EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Charley sat in the tree-top scanning the island in search of\r\npossible squatters who might interfere with the gathering of the rice,\r\nhe saw something else that put a new idea into his head, and before his\r\nwatch was done he had quite made up his mind to do something brilliant\r\nwhich would surprise and delight his companions.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw was nothing more remarkable than a calf, or rather a young\r\nbull, perhaps a year old, browsing in the edge of a thicket half a mile\r\nor more to the west of the camp, and not many hundreds of yards from the\r\nshore. There is nothing remarkable in such a sight as that, but the\r\ncircumstances of this case were peculiar, and so the sight set Charley,\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he remembered what Ned had told him and Jack about\r\nthe wild cattle on the island, and reflecting that it had been a good\r\nmany years since the original stock of animals were abandoned, he could\r\nnot help regarding this yearling bullock as something more than a mere\r\nbullock. It was game; a wild animal roaming at will over unoccupied\r\nlands, and to kill it would be quite as good sport as deer-stalking or\r\nbear-hunting.\r\n\r\nThen, too, Charley and his companions were really in sore need of meat.\r\nAn exclusive diet of fish, oysters, and other such things soon wearies\r\nthe palate, and becomes exceedingly distasteful. It is true that Ned's\r\nturtle had somewhat broken this monotony, but the relief had been only\r\npartial, and the boys very eagerly craved meat--beef, mutton, or pork.\r\nThey had made no effort to get such meat, only because they had no idea\r\nthat any such was to be had.\r\n\r\nThe snake dinner had never been repeated. It is true that the snake was\r\nsavory, and the boys had spoken truthfully when they declared themselves\r\npleased with it. But that was while their hunger lasted, and when they\r\nhad finished they had no longer a keen appetite to oppose to prejudice,\r\nso that, with full stomachs, the old objections returned, and all three\r\nboys were seized with a peculiar loathing for the food they had eaten.\r\nPerhaps it was only because they had eaten too much; but, whatever the\r\nreason was, the fact remained that they were all sickened by the thought\r\nof what they had eaten, and, while they said nothing about this feeling,\r\nno one of them ever proposed to repeat the experiment of eating snake.\r\n\r\nNow Charley meant to have an abundance of meat against which no such\r\nobjection could be urged. Here was a fat young steer whose beef was to\r\nbe had for the taking. How to get it was at first a perplexing question.\r\nThere was no gun with which to shoot the bullock, and there were no dogs\r\nin camp with which to chase it; but after some reflection Master Charley\r\nwas confident that he could kill the animal with the means at disposal.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing about either his discovery or his purpose when his\r\ncompanions returned to camp, because he wished to give them a complete\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nHe merely said that he wanted to make a little hunting expedition, and\r\nthat perhaps he might succeed in knocking over a rabbit or some other\r\nanimal good to eat. His companions had little hope of any such good\r\nluck, but they offered no objection, and Charley, arming himself with\r\nthe hunting-knife and the hatchet, set forth on his quest.\r\n\r\nHe found the bullock not far from the place at which he had seen it\r\nbefore, quietly browsing in the edge of the timber. After carefully\r\nreconnoitering the position, Charley went into the woods and crept upon\r\nthe animal very cautiously through the thick undergrowth. His plan was\r\nto creep up in this way until he should be within a few feet of his\r\nprey, and then, springing forward suddenly, to strike the bullock\r\nbetween his young horns with the hatchet. Charley had seen a butcher\r\nkill a large steer by a comparatively slight blow, delivered at the\r\nright place on the animal's head, and he was very sure that he knew\r\nwhere to strike.\r\n\r\nAs he crept up he carefully avoided making any kind of noise, but when\r\nwithin a dozen feet of the place from which he meant to spring, he made\r\na misstep, broke a stick, and alarmed the bullock, which quietly trotted\r\naway.\r\n\r\nCharley was disappointed, but by no means disheartened. He had only to\r\nbegin over again, and proceed more cautiously next time. He crept very\r\nslowly and consumed nearly half an hour in his approach. This time he\r\nbroke no sticks and made no noise of any kind. Nearer and nearer he\r\ndrew. He could hear the bullock's breathing, but still he must get\r\nnearer. A log lay just in front of him, and he could not well spring\r\nover it before striking, without alarming the animal and missing his\r\naim. He must creep around this obstruction first, and this he did\r\nsuccessfully, but the bullock, though not alarmed, moved away just\r\nbefore Charley reached a position from which to strike. It did not run,\r\nbut quietly walked away to nibble some grass which grew at a spot a\r\ndozen paces distant.\r\n\r\nThis second disappointment shook Charley's already strained nerves\r\nconsiderably, but, impatient as he now was, he controlled himself and\r\nresumed his silent advance. Luckily the animal's head was turned\r\ndirectly away from him, and that fact greatly lessened the danger of his\r\ndiscovery. His chance was now so good, indeed, that a few moments more\r\nmight have brought his attempt to a completely successful issue, if he\r\nhad been content to follow his original plan. But just as he was in the\r\nact of springing forward to deliver his blow, with every prospect of\r\nsuccess, a new thought struck Charley. It was easy to spring upon the\r\nbullock's back, and from that point Charley thought he could deal not\r\none, but many successive blows, thus making sure work of what might not\r\notherwise be sure.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he leaped upon the animal's back, and as he did so the\r\nstartled creature sprang forward through the bushes, nearly unseating\r\nhis rider. The blow which Charley tried to deliver was a disastrous\r\nfailure. He missed the brute's head, and the hatchet slipping from his\r\nhand, was hurled into the thicket.\r\n\r\nCharley had no time to think of the hatchet, however. The infuriated\r\nbullock plunged headlong through the thicket and then across an open\r\nglade and into the woods again, going in the direction of the camp, and\r\nCharley had all that he could do to keep his seat. He was beaten black\r\nand blue by the saplings encountered; his face was scratched, and his\r\nclothes torn almost to shreds. Still, seeing that the bullock was going\r\ntoward the camp, he held on, with an unreasoning impression that, once\r\nat the camp, the animal would be secured.\r\n\r\nJack and Ned happened to be outside the stockade when Charley came\r\ndashing past, but of course they could do nothing, and a moment after\r\nthey caught sight of their companion, he was swept from his seat by an\r\noverhanging branch of a tree, and the frightened bullock continued his\r\nimpetuous flight alone.\r\n\r\nJack and Ned hastened to their friend's assistance. For a moment Charley\r\nseemed stunned, but he soon came to himself sufficiently to ask in a\r\nquerulous tone:\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you head him off?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to convince Charley that they had been entirely\r\npowerless to capture the bullock, so fixed had been his determination to\r\nsecure so valuable a prize; but after a while he began to see matters in\r\ntheir true light, and to understand that Ned and Jack could not have\r\nstopped the animal, even if they had been prepared for his coming, as in\r\nfact they were not.\r\n\r\nThen Charley examined his own bruises, which were pretty severe, though\r\nno bones were broken.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of the damage,\" he said, after awhile, \"is the loss of the\r\nhatchet, and I suppose we shall find that.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END OF CHARLEY'S ADVENTURE.]\r\n\r\n\"Did you lose the hunting-knife too?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" exclaimed Charley; \"what an idiot I am, to be sure! I had that\r\nin my belt all the time, and I might have got the beef if I had only\r\nthought to use it!\"\r\n\r\nThis was true enough. While going through the thicket, Charley had\r\nenough to do to cling to the back of the bullock, but while crossing the\r\nopen glade he might easily have drawn and used the long hunting-knife if\r\nhe had thought of it. But he had not thought of it, and it was now too\r\nlate for the thinking to do any good.\r\n\r\n\"It is just as well as it is,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Just as well!\" exclaimed Charley; \"well, I don't see that. I don't know\r\nhow it is with you, but for my part, I'd relish a beefsteak just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"So would I,\" answered Ned; \"but that yearling isn't ours, and we've no\r\nright to kill it, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It's a wild animal, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so. The squatters must have killed all the wild cattle\r\nlong ago, and this tame calf probably belongs to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they helped themselves pretty freely to our things, so I\r\nshouldn't be a bit sorry if I had killed the animal while I thought it a\r\nwild one,\" said Charley, rather ruefully.\r\n\r\nThe search for the hatchet was a somewhat protracted one, but that\r\nimportant tool was found at last, and so, if Charley's effort to\r\nreplenish the camp larder did no good, it at least did no harm beyond\r\nbruising that young huntsman's limbs, scratching his face, and tearing\r\nhis clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAUNCH OF THE \"APHRODITE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary to their expectations, the boys were left in peace by their\r\nenemies after that last unsuccessful attempt to burn their camp.\r\n\r\nThe tar-kiln was promptly rebuilt, and by Saturday night a new supply of\r\ntar was ready. Early on Monday morning the work of converting this tar\r\ninto pitch, by boiling it, was begun. This was necessarily a slow\r\nprocess, because the kettle was small and the space to be covered was\r\nlarge, for the plan was to paint the whole outside surface of the boat\r\nwith the pitch, in order to make it as water-tight as possible. As soon\r\nas the first kettleful of pitch was ready, it was carefully applied\r\nwhile smoking hot, care being taken to work it well into the seams. Then\r\nanother kettleful was set to boil, and so the work went slowly forward.\r\nAs the pitch cooled it became hard, like varnish, and the effect was to\r\nstop all leaks pretty thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAt first the boat sat right side up, but raised upon the blocks on which\r\nshe had been built, so that it was easy to pass under her; but in\r\napplying the first kettleful of pitch the boys discovered the\r\nawkwardness of this position, and determined to turn the _Aphrodite_\r\nbottom upward, for the sake of convenience. This was a difficult task,\r\nas the boat was too heavy for the combined strength of the three young\r\nship-builders; but it was necessary to accomplish it, and Jack's\r\nmechanical skill devised means for the purpose. Cutting some long poles\r\nto serve as levers, and a large number of short, stout sticks, he\r\ndirected his companions to raise one side of the boat with the levers.\r\nWhile they held it up he quickly built two cribs of the short sticks,\r\none at the bow and the other at the stern, and when the levers were\r\nremoved the boat rested easily upon these. Then a new bight was taken\r\nwith the levers, and the side of the boat was raised a few inches\r\nfurther. Building the cribs up to support her in this position, Jack\r\ndirected the boys to repeat the operation again and again, each time\r\nsupporting the boat by increasing the height of the cribs. Finally he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now one more bight will throw her over, but we must get ready first to\r\nease her down, or else we shall strain her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we do it?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"By setting some poles up at an angle on cribs. I'll show you.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he went to the other side of the boat and built some cribs\r\nabout five or six feet away from the gunwale on which the boat rested;\r\ncarrying these up as high as his head, he took a number of straight\r\npoles and placed their ends on the ground just under the gunwale,\r\nresting the other ends upon the tall cribs. This made a slanting\r\nframework, the bottom of which was against one gunwale, while the top\r\nwas not more than a few feet distant from the other edge of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, when this was done, \"she has only to fall a foot or two\r\nforward; her weight will be on her face then, and we'll ease her down by\r\ndrawing out the crib-sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a better way than that,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's throw her forward first; then I'll show you.\"\r\n\r\nResting, as the boat was, almost upon her gunwale, it was easy to push\r\nher forward, and when that was done she was a little more than half-way\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Ned, \"instead of lowering that upper gunwale, let's lift the\r\nlower one with the levers, and block it up. We needn't raise it more\r\nthan a foot; then she'll show her whole under-side to us just as well as\r\nif she lay flat on her face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, after studying the matter, \"and it will be all the\r\neasier to turn her back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we got to turn her back again?\" asked Charley, whose arms and back\r\nhad been pretty severely taxed in the effort to reverse the position of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" said Ned, \"not if we can make up our minds to launch her,\r\nbottom upward, and to ride back to Bluffton on her keel. Otherwise we\r\nmust turn her right side up before we launch her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be hard to turn her back, Charley,\" said Jack. \"She'll be\r\nnearly on edge, you see, and it won't require lifting--only a little\r\npushing. But come, let's raise this gunwale. Six inches will do, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nOne more application of the levers served the purpose, and the work of\r\napplying the pitch was resumed.\r\n\r\nNo other difficult problem presented itself, and by noon on Thursday the\r\npitching was complete. Before turning the _Aphrodite_ back again, Jack\r\nand his companions cut some long, straight poles, and made an inclined\r\nplane of them from the blocks on which the boat rested to the water.\r\nThey removed all the bark from these poles, so that they should be as\r\nsmooth as possible.\r\n\r\nThen the boat was turned back into position, her side toward the water.\r\nIt was necessary now to lift her up until her keel should rest upon the\r\ninclined plane, down which she was to slide, of her own weight, into the\r\nsea. This was a somewhat difficult task, requiring the use of the levers\r\nand a good deal of blocking up as the levers raised the boat, inch by\r\ninch. It was accomplished at last, however, and, suffering neither\r\nstrain nor other injury, the _Aphrodite_ slipped into the sea, and rode\r\ngracefully upon the water.\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for the new boat!\" cried Charley, and with a will they\r\nwere given.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Ned, \"we can begin to see the end of our adventures.\r\nLet's see. We've only to make some oars, and then we can be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall we start?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is Thursday evening. We can finish three oars--two for\r\nrowing and one for steering--by to-morrow evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can make an early start on Saturday morning,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Not very well,\" said Ned. \"The tide will be against us until about one\r\no'clock or half-past, and the _Aphrodite_ is too heavy for two oars\r\nagainst tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't all three row?\" asked Charley, who persistently refused to\r\nunderstand any thing about the management of boats.\r\n\r\n\"Because then we should have two oars on one side and only one on the\r\nother, and we'd go around in a circle. We can only use two oars, while\r\nthe odd fellow steers. We'll be able to rest in that way, too, by taking\r\nthe steering-oar turn and turn about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll get away when the tide turns on Saturday,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, or a little before,--say at noon. That will give us plenty of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll get back to Bluffton,\" said Charley, \"exactly at the time\r\nappointed with Maum Sally, I wonder if she'll have some supper ready for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she don't she'll have to get some pretty quick,\" said Ned. \"I won't\r\nlet her scold me till she sets supper before us, and she won't be happy\r\ntill she gives me a good 'settin' to rights,' as she calls it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better wait until we get to Bluffton before we order that\r\nsupper?\" said Jack; \"there's 'many a slip,' you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a croaker you're getting to be, Jack!\" exclaimed Charley. \"What's\r\nto bother us now, I'd like to know? We've got a good boat, we can make\r\noars to-morrow, and Ned knows the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly!\" replied Jack. \"I suppose we shall get there safely, and\r\nI'm not in the least disposed to croak. I only thought that you and Ned\r\nwere a trifle hasty in your assumption that every thing is to go\r\nperfectly smooth with us. For the last month things have had a pretty\r\nfixed habit of going the other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but we've conquered our difficulties now, and there's nothing\r\nthat I can think of to stand in the way of our getting off at the\r\nappointed time. And if we leave here at noon on Saturday, what can\r\nhappen to prevent our arrival at Bluffton that evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Jack; \"nothing at all, I hope. But when I\r\nthink what a chapter of accidents we've been through, I am disposed to\r\nwait till I see Maum Sally, before I get my mouth ready for the supper\r\nshe's to cook.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE \"APHRODITE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday dawned soft and warm. After breakfast the boys cooked the few\r\nprovisions that remained, intending to eat their mid-day meal in the\r\nboat, as a mere luncheon, and to satisfy their appetites with better\r\nfood of Maum Sally's preparing, when they should arrive at Bluffton.\r\n\r\nThey filled the coffee-pot with drinking water--for the water kegs of\r\nthe _Red Bird_ had been lost in that boat's mishap,--and bestowed their\r\nother scant belongings on board. The moment that the outgoing tide grew\r\nslack they began their homeward voyage, giving the old camp three lusty,\r\nfarewell cheers, and parting with their old associations there with a\r\ntouch of real regret.\r\n\r\nFor the first mile or two Ned and Jack were at the oars. Then Charley\r\nrelieved Ned, as the boat drew out from among the low-lying marsh\r\nislands into a broad stretch of water.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing in from the sea, not strongly, but steadily, and\r\nafter an hour's rowing Jack saw that Ned was rather uneasily watching\r\nsome light, low-flying banks of mist which were scudding along overhead.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Ned?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of importance--or at least I hope so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it? Do those little clouds mean rain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish they did,\" said Ned; \"but they're not clouds, at least in the\r\nusual sense, and I'm afraid they don't mean rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out with it. We're partners in all our joys and sorrows,\" said Charley,\r\n\"so let's hear all about the clouds that aren't clouds but something\r\nelse. What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"A sea fog,\" answered Ned; \"this breeze is coming in from the sea laden\r\nwith moisture, and those clouds just above us are banks of fog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be shut in in five minutes,\" said Ned. \"Look! you can't see\r\nhalf a mile now, and it is settling right down upon us, growing thicker\r\nevery minute.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as Ned said. The wall of thick fog was closing in, and it was\r\nalready impossible to see any thing except the waste of water around\r\nthem. A few minutes later even the water could be seen for only a few\r\nyards around.\r\n\r\n\"Lie on your oars, boys,\" said Ned.\r\n\r\n\"Why not row on?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't know which way to steer, and rowing may only take us\r\nout of our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you hold your course straight ahead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. That would be possible in a fog if rowing always drove a boat\r\nstraight ahead, and if there were no cross currents in the water; but\r\nboth 'ifs' stand in the way. Without a compass nobody can keep a boat in\r\nany thing like a straight course in such a fog. The tide is running up,\r\nand so if we don't row at all we shall drift in the right direction, at\r\nleast in a general way, while if we row, we may go all wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long is such a fog likely to last?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to tell. A change in the wind or in the state of the\r\natmosphere may clear it away at any moment; or it may last a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"A week!\" exclaimed Charley; \"what shall we do if it does? We haven't an\r\nounce of food left, and only a little water,\" looking into the\r\ncoffee-pot.\r\n\r\n\"We needn't manage the whole week this afternoon,\" said Jack. \"It will\r\nbe better to keep cool and do the best thing that can be done every\r\nminute. Just now, Ned says, the best thing is to drift with the tide, so\r\nwe'll drift, and wait, and keep our wits about us so as to see any\r\nchance that offers for doing better.\"\r\n\r\nJack spoke in a cheerful voice, and his tone of courage served to brace\r\nhis companions somewhat, but it was plain to all three that their\r\nposition was really one of great danger and uncertainty. It was Jack's\r\nexcellent habit, however, to grow strong and courageous in difficulty or\r\ndanger; he never allowed himself to become panic-stricken, or to do\r\nfoolish, frantic things.\r\n\r\n\"Jack,\" said Charley after a while, \"I don't believe there's any whine\r\nin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jack; \"I hope there isn't. What good would\r\nwhining do?\"\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and still the fog grew thicker. Another hour; the breeze\r\nhad ceased to blow, and the gray mist lay like a blanket over the water.\r\nIt seemed piled in thick layers, one on top of another. It was so dense\r\nthat it could be seen floating between one of the boys and another, like\r\nsmoke from a cigar. The boys could see its slow writhing and twisting in\r\nthe still air, moved as it was only by their breath, or by the\r\noccasional movements of their bodies. It would have been impossible in\r\nsuch a fog to see a ship twenty feet distant.\r\n\r\nFor still another hour and another the boys sat still in the boat,\r\nrarely speaking or in any way breaking the awful silence of the\r\nfog-bound solitude.\r\n\r\nAt last Ned bent his head down close to the gunwale to scan the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\n\"I see marsh grass here,\" he said, \"but it is completely under water.\r\nWatch for any that shows above the surface, and if you see any catch\r\nhold of it and hold on.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys bent over, one on one side, the other on the other. Presently\r\nthe protruding tops of the tall marsh grass appeared above the water,\r\nand seemed to float slowly by. Several times Jack and Charley caught\r\nsmall bunches of it, but the impetus of the drifting boat was too great,\r\nand the grass was pulled up from the muddy bottom. After a little while,\r\nthe water growing shallower, the grass showed higher above the surface,\r\nwhile it increased also in quantity, impeding the motion of the boat.\r\nThen each of the boys seized a bunch and the boat was brought to a\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\"There, that's better,\" said Ned, as the motion of the boat ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you want to drift?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is about the turn of the tide,\" answered Ned, \"and I don't\r\nwant to drift in the wrong direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why didn't you cast anchor when you first saw from the grass that\r\nwe were in shallow water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't want to be caught here on a marsh island if I can help\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see it is about high tide now, and we have drifted upon one\r\nof the many mud banks covered with this marsh grass. Some of them are\r\ncovered with water at high tide, as this one is, but quite bare when\r\nthe tide is out. When I saw that we were drifting over one I wanted to\r\nstop the boat, to avoid being carried back again toward the sea; but\r\nwe're in danger of getting left here high and dry on a mud bank when the\r\ntide runs out, and that would be a bad fix to get into. So instead of\r\ndropping anchor, we'll simply hold on by the grass, and as the tide goes\r\nout we'll try to work off into deeper water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could, then,\" said Charley, who had recovered his spirits; \"if\r\nI could see I'd steer for Bluffton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Charley,\" said Ned, \"this is no joking matter, I can assure you.\r\nIt's growing quite dark now, and unless the fog lifts very soon we may\r\nbe stuck here in the mud, for the night at least; suppose you give her a\r\nfew stokes with the oars, boys; the tide is falling rapidly, and we must\r\nget off this bank.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys rowed slowly, Ned steering and watching the water. It grew\r\nsteadily shallower, so he turned the boat about, convinced that the\r\ndirection he had taken was toward the centre of the bank, instead of\r\ntoward the deep water. He had not gone far in the new direction\r\nhowever, before the keel scraped the mud, and another change had to be\r\nmade in the course. Still the keel scraped, in whatever direction he\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n\"Pull away with all your might, boys!\" he cried; \"if we don't reach deep\r\nwater in five minutes we're stuck!\"\r\n\r\nJack and Charley bent to their oars, and for a few minutes the boat\r\nslipped forward through the tall marsh grass. But her keel was dragging\r\nin the soft mud, and as the tide was rapidly running out, the boat sank\r\ndeeper every minute.\r\n\r\n\"Pull away, as hard as you can!\" cried Ned, seeing that the speed was\r\nrapidly growing less. \"Here, you're exhausted, Jack; let me take your\r\noar. Now, Charley, give it to her!\"\r\n\r\nThe oarsmen bent to their work with the strength of desperation, but the\r\nkeel was now completely buried in the mud, and the whole bottom of the\r\nboat rested in the slimy ooze. Do what they would, the boys could drive\r\nher no further.\r\n\r\n\"Stuck!\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, stuck, fairly stuck, and in for a night of it, fog or no fog,\"\r\nsaid Ned.\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing now, except go to sleep if we can. It's so cold and raw that\r\nwe'll find that pretty hard work. I wish we had brought a lot of moss\r\nfor blankets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if the fog lifts in the night?\" asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what if it does? We can do nothing now till the tide comes in\r\nto-morrow morning. We're high and dry now, and the tide will continue to\r\nrun out until one or two o'clock to-night. Then it will turn, but we\r\nshan't be afloat again till very nearly high tide,--say about seven or\r\neight o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jack, \"and as we have eaten nearly nothing since morning,\r\nand have nothing to eat till we get to Bluffton, we shall need all the\r\nstrength we can get from sleep. So let's sleep if we can.\"\r\n\r\nBestowing themselves as comfortably as they could, the three worn-out,\r\nhalf-famished lads did their best to sleep; but there was very little\r\nchance of that. No sooner had they ceased to exert themselves, than the\r\npenetrating cold of the fog, which had already saturated their scanty\r\nclothing, made them shiver and shake as with an ague fit.\r\n\r\nThey were obliged occasionally to go to the oars for exercise, in order\r\nto keep their blood in circulation, and so there was no chance of any\r\nthing like sleep beyond an occasional cat nap. Not long before dawn it\r\nbegan to rain, and Ned, who had been dozing, suddenly sprang up, crying\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Rain? Good!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, 'good'?\" asked Charley, shivering; \"I'm damp enough already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, because if it rains hard the fog will disappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it will be converted into rain, and fall. A fog disappears\r\nalways either by rising and floating away, or by falling in the shape of\r\nrain; and this one means to fall, I should say, if I may judge by the\r\nway it is coming down now.\"\r\n\r\nIt had, indeed, begun to pour. The condition of the boys was thus\r\nrendered still more uncomfortable than before, but at least their\r\nprospects were brightened by way of compensation, and as the steady\r\ndownpour cleared the air of the dense fog, their spirits bounded up\r\nagain in spite of all the discomforts of their situation.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jack,\" said Charley, \"are you a prophet or a weather witch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, so far as I am informed,\" replied Jack; \"why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only because I suspect that you either foresaw this fog or created it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the force of your suspicion,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember how you croaked about slips between the cup and the\r\nlip when Ned and I were so sure of getting to Bluffton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course; but I didn't really expect any thing of this nature. I\r\nonly spoke generally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the abundance of your wisdom. But I won't make fun, for you were\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, besides,\" said Ned, \"the situation just now isn't a bit funny.\r\nThere's a young river running down my back, and I'm in for a good\r\nscolding from Maum Sally when I see her. She'll scold me for overstaying\r\nmy time, for wrecking the boat, for losing my boots, for spoiling my\r\nclothes, and for every thing else she can think of. And yet, though\r\nyou'll hardly believe it, I heartily wish I could be sure of getting\r\nthat scolding very early this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMAUM SALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaylight came about five o'clock, and Ned made use of the earliest light\r\nfor looking about him and determining his position. So buried was the\r\nboat in the tall marsh grass, that he had to stand upon the highest part\r\nof the bow in order to see at all. At first he could make out very\r\nlittle, but as it grew lighter--for, the rain having ceased, the light\r\ngained rapidly toward six o'clock--he was able to make out the bearings\r\npretty well.\r\n\r\n\"I say, fellows,\" he said, turning to his companions, \"we made a centre\r\nshot. If we had tried, in the broadest light of the clearest day, we\r\ncouldn't have put the _Aphrodite_ more exactly in the middle of this\r\nmarsh bank.\"\r\n\r\nFurther inspection showed that this judgment was accurate. The boat lay\r\nprecisely in the middle of the little island, which stretched away two\r\nor three hundred yards on each side.\r\n\r\nThe tide had risen enough by half-past six for the water to lick the\r\nsides of the boat, but it would be a full hour or more before the\r\n_Aphrodite_ would float up out of the mud, and even then it would be\r\nnecessary to wait awhile longer for deeper water, before trying to push\r\nher great bulk through the rank marsh grass.\r\n\r\n\"Why not hurry matters by getting out and pushing the empty boat?\" asked\r\nimpatient Charley, who had already declared himself to be in a state of\r\nactual starvation.\r\n\r\n\"Just take one of the oars, Charley,\" said Ned, \"and feel of the bottom\r\nwe should have to walk on.\"\r\n\r\nCharley took the oar, pushed it through the roots of the grass, and\r\nthen, with scarcely an effort, plunged its whole length straight\r\ndownward through the soft mud.\r\n\r\n\"Ya--as, I see,\" he drawled, as he drew the oar out again; \"it isn't\r\nprecisely the sort of lawn that one would choose for walking about on in\r\nslippers.\"\r\n\r\nJust then oars were heard, and looking in the direction from which the\r\nsound came, Ned suddenly cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Hi! Maum Sally! Hi there! Here we are, out here in the marsh!\" Then\r\nturning to his companions, he said:\r\n\r\n\"It's Maum Sally in the little boat. I wonder where she's going this\r\nearly on Sunday morning.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HI! MAUM SALLY!\"]\r\n\r\nMaum Sally did not leave him long in doubt on this head. Rowing her boat\r\nas far into the grass and as near to them as she could, she came to a\r\nstop at about a hundred and fifty yards from the _Aphrodite_. Then\r\nstanding up in her boat, placing her bare arms akimbo, and tossing her\r\nred-turbaned head back, she began:\r\n\r\n\"Now, look heah, young Ned! What you mean by dis heah sort o' doins?\r\nDidn't you promise me faithful to be back agin in a month? An' ain't de\r\nmonth done gone, an' heah you is a idlin' about on a ma'sh, an' it\r\nSunday mawnin' too? Jes' you come straight 'long home now.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had spent her first breath in a tirade which was half scolding\r\nand half coddling,--for that was always her way with Ned, whom she had\r\nspoiled all his life, from the cradle upward,--she paused long enough\r\nfor Ned to explain that he and his companions could not go to her until\r\nthe tide should rise at least a foot more.\r\n\r\n\"Now listen, boys,\" he said; \"she'll keep it up till the rising tide\r\nbrings her to us, and we're in for an hour of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not persuade her to go back and get breakfast ready by the time we\r\nget there?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Go back? Not she. My month was up yesterday, and as I didn't put in an\r\nappearance, she set out to find me and bring me home this morning, and\r\nyou just bet she won't go home without me. She'll row this way as fast\r\nas the rising water will let her, and she'll keep on scolding and\r\ncoddling me all the time. Then she'll jump in here and hug me as if I\r\nwere her long-lost baby boy. Hear her!\"\r\n\r\nMaum Sally fulfilled Ned's prediction to the letter. As she drew nearer,\r\nand made out the forlorn condition of the young Crusoes, discovering,\r\nlittle by little, how ragged they were, she scolded more and more\r\nsavagely, while Ned laughed and heartily enjoyed it all, taking pains to\r\ndirect her attention to the various losses he had sustained, and hinting\r\nnow and then at the difficulties he had encountered and the dangers he\r\nhad passed. Each word of his gave Maum Sally a new theme for her\r\nscolding, and as the little boat pushed itself up to the big one she\r\nleaped from the one into the other, changing her tone, manner, and\r\nexpression in the very middle of a sentence, somewhat thus:\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, young Ned, ef I gits my han's on you, you ugly, provokin',\r\nno 'count young scape--darlin', blessed boy, aint ole Sally happy to git\r\nher arms roun' you agin, and hug you jis like you was a baby agin; an'\r\nnow I's got you safe in these arms agin, I tell you I's happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden change in the sentence occurred just as Maum Sally stepped\r\nfrom one boat into the other, and fell upon Ned with that savage fury of\r\naffection which only a dear old black nurse can feel.\r\n\r\nTo row out of the marsh when the water grew a little deeper, and then to\r\nrow home to a late but toothsome breakfast, was easy enough now. Then a\r\nlong day of complete rest followed, and the whole story of the wreck of\r\nthe _Red Bird_ was a memory merely.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Wreck of The Red Bird, by George Cary Eggleston",
