But I thoroughly believe myself, and hope to prove\r\nto you, that science is full of beautiful pictures, of real\r\npoetry, and of wonder-working fairies; and what is more, I\r\npromise you they shall be true fairies, whom you will love just\r\nas much when you are old and greyheaded as when you are young;\r\nfor you will be able to call them up wherever you wander by land\r\nor by sea, through meadow or through wood, through water or\r\nthrough air; and though they themselves will always remain\r\ninvisible, yet you will see their wonderful poet at work\r\neverywhere around you.\r\n\r\nLet us first see for a moment what kind of tales science has to\r\ntell, and how far they are equal to the old fairy tales we all\r\nknow so well.  Who does not remember the tale of the \"Sleeping\r\nBeauty in the Wood,\" and how under the spell of the angry fairy\r\nthe maiden pricked herself with the spindle and slept a hundred\r\nyears?  How the horses in the stall, the dogs in the court-yard,\r\nthe doves on the roof, the cook who was boxing the scullery boy's\r\nears in the kitchen, and the king and queen with all their\r\ncourtiers in the hall remained spell-bound, while a thick hedge\r\ngrew up all round the castle and all within was still as death.\r\nBut when the hundred years had passed the valiant prince came,\r\nthe thorny hedge opened before him bearing beautiful flowers; and\r\nhe, entering the castle, reached the room where the princess lay,\r\nand with one sweet kiss raised her and all around her to life\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nCan science bring any tale to match this?\r\n\r\nTell me, is there anything in this world more busy and active\r\nthan water, as it rushes along in the swift brook, or dashes over\r\nthe stones, or spouts up in the fountain, or trickles down from\r\nthe roof, or shakes itself into ripples on the surface of the\r\npond as the wind blows over it?  But have you never seen this\r\nwater spell-bound and motionless?  Look out of the window some\r\ncold frosty morning in winter, at the little brook which\r\nyesterday was flowing gently past the house, and see how still it\r\nlies, with the stones over which it was dashing now held tightly\r\nin its icy grasp.  Notice the wind-ripples on the pond; they have\r\nbecome fixed and motionless.  Look up at the roof of the house.\r\nThere, instead of living doves merely charmed to sleep, we have\r\nrunning water caught in the very act of falling and turned into\r\ntransparent icicles, decorating the eaves with a beautiful\r\ncrystal fringe.  On every tree and bush you will catch the water-\r\ndrops napping, in the form of tiny crystals; while the fountain\r\nlooks like a tree of glass with long down-hanging pointed leaves.\r\nEven the damp of your own breath lies rigid and still on the\r\nwindow-pane frozen into delicate patterns like fern-leaves of\r\nice.\r\n\r\nAll this water was yesterday flowing busily, or falling drop by\r\ndrop, or floating invisibly in the air; now it is all caught and\r\nspell-bound - by whom?  By the enchantments of the frost-giant\r\nwho holds it fast in his grip and will not let it go.\r\n\r\nBut wait awhile, the deliverer is coming.  In a few weeks or\r\ndays, or it may be in a few hours, the brave sun will shine down;\r\nthe dull-grey, leaden sky will melt before his, as the hedge gave\r\nway before the prince in the fairy tale, and when the sunbeam\r\ngently kisses the frozen water it will be set free.  Then the\r\nbrook will flow rippling on again; the frost-drops will be shaken\r\ndown from the trees, the icicles fall from the roof, the moisture\r\ntrickle down the window-pane, and in the bright, warm sunshine\r\nall will be alive again.\r\n\r\nIs not this a fairy tale of nature?  and such as these it is\r\nwhich science tells.\r\n\r\nAgain, who has not heard of Catskin, who came out of a hollow\r\ntree, bringing a walnut containing three beautiful dresses - the\r\nfirst glowing as the sun, the second pale and beautiful as the\r\nmoon, the third spangled like the star-lit sky, and each so fine\r\nand delicate that all three could be packed into a walnut shell;\r\nand each one of these tiny structures is not the mere dress but\r\nthe home of a living animal.  It is a tiny, tiny shell-palace\r\nmade of the most delicate lacework, each pattern being more\r\nbeautiful than the last; and what is more, the minute creature\r\nthat lives in it has built it out of the foam of the sea, though\r\nhe himself is nothing more than a drop of jelly.\r\n\r\nLastly, anyone who has read the 'Wonderful Travellers' must\r\nrecollect the man whose sight was so keen that he could hit the\r\neye of a fly sitting on a tree two miles away.  But tell me, can\r\nyou see gas before it is lighted, even when it is coming out of\r\nthe gas-jet close to your eyes?  Yet, if you learn to use that\r\nwonderful instrument the spectroscope, it will enable you to tell\r\none kind of gas from another, even when they are both ninety-one\r\nmillions of miles away on the face of the sun; nay more, it will\r\nread for you the nature of the different gases in the far distant\r\nstars, billions of miles away, and actually tell you whether you\r\ncould find there any of the same metals which we have on the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWe might find hundreds of such fairy tales in the domain of\r\nscience, but these three will serve as examples, and we much pass\r\non to make the acquaintance of the science-fairies themselves,\r\nand see if they are as real as our old friends.\r\n\r\nTell me, why do you love fairy-land?  what is its charm?  Is it\r\nnot that things happen so suddenly, so mysteriously, and without\r\nman having anything to do with it?  In fairy-land, flowers blow,\r\nhouses spring up like Aladdin's palace in a single night, and\r\npeople are carried hundreds of miles in an instant by the touch\r\nof a fairy wand.\r\n\r\nAnd then this land is not some distant country to which we can\r\nnever hope to travel.  It is here in the midst of us, only our\r\neyes must be opened or we cannot see it.  Ariel and Puck did not\r\nlive in some unknown region.  On the contrary, Ariel's song is\r\n\r\n \"Where the bee sucks, there suck I;\r\n  In a cowslip's bell I lie;\r\n  There I couch when owls do cry.\r\n  On the bat's back I do fly,\r\n  After summer, merrily.\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant falls asleep some evening in a wood and his eyes are\r\nopened by a fairy wand, so that he sees the little goblins and\r\nimps dancing around him on the green sward, sitting on mushrooms,\r\nor in the heads of the flowers, drinking out of acorn-cups,\r\nfighting with blades of grass, and riding on grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the gallant knight, riding to save some poor oppressed\r\nmaiden, dashes across the foaming torrent; and just in the\r\nmiddle, as he is being swept away, his eyes are opened, and he\r\nsees fairy water-nymphs soothing his terrified horse and guiding\r\nhim gently to the opposite shore.  They are close at hand, these\r\nsprites, to the simple peasant or the gallant knight, or to\r\nanyone who has the gift of the fairies and can see them.  but the\r\nman who scoffs at them, and does not believe in them or care for\r\nthem, he never sees them.  Only now and then they play him an\r\nugly trick, leading him into some treacherous bog and leaving him\r\nto get out as he may.\r\n\r\nNow, exactly all this which is true of the fairies of our\r\nchildhood is true too of the fairies of science.  There are\r\nforces around us, and among us, which I shall ask you to allow me\r\nto call fairies, and these are ten thousand times more wonderful,\r\nmore magical, and more beautiful in their work, than those of the\r\nold fairy tales.  They, too, are invisible, and many people live\r\nand die without ever seeing them or caring to see them.  These\r\npeople go about with their eyes shut, either because they will\r\nnot open them, or because no one has taught them how to see.\r\nThey fret and worry over their own little work and their own\r\npetty troubles, and do not know how to rest and refresh\r\nthemselves, by letting the fairies open their eyes and show them\r\nthe calm sweet picture of nature.  They are like Peter Bell of\r\nwhom Wordsworth wrote:-\r\n\r\n \"A primrose by a river's brim\r\n  A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n  And it was nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nBut we will not be like these, we will open our eyes and ask,\r\n\"What are these forces or fairies, and how can we see them?\"\r\n\r\nJust go out into the country, and sit down quietly and watch\r\nnature at work.  Listen to the wind as it blows, look at the\r\nclouds rolling overhead, and waves rippling on the pond at your\r\nfeet.  Hearken to the brook as it flows by, watch the flower-buds\r\nopening one by one, and then ask yourself, \"How all this is\r\ndone?\"  Go out in the evening and see the dew gather drop by drop\r\nupon the grass, or trace the delicate hoar-frost crystals which\r\nbespangle every blade on a winter's morning.  Look at the vivid\r\nflashes of lightening in a storm, and listen to the pealing\r\nthunder: and then tell me, by what machinery is all this\r\nwonderful work done?  Man does none of it, neither could he stop\r\nit if he were to try; for it is all the work of those invisible\r\nforces or fairies whose acquaintance I wish you to make.  Day and\r\nnight, summer and winter, storm or calm, these fairies are at\r\nwork, and we may hear them and know them, and make friends of\r\nthem if we will.\r\n\r\nThere is only one gift we must have before we can learn to know\r\nthem - we must have imagination.  I do not mean mere fancy, which\r\ncreates unreal images and impossible monsters, but imagination,\r\nthe power of making pictures or images in our mind, of that which\r\nis, though it is invisible to us.  Most children have this\r\nglorious gift, and love to picture to themselves all that is told\r\nthem, and to hear the same tale over and over again till they see\r\nevery bit of it as if it were real.  This is why they are sure to\r\nlove science it its tales are told them aright; and I, for one,\r\nhope the day may never come when we may lose that childish\r\nclearness of vision, which enables us through the temporal things\r\nwhich are seen, to realize those eternal truths which are unseen.\r\n\r\nIf you have this gift of imagination come with me, and in these\r\nlectures we will look for the invisible fairies of nature.\r\n\r\nWatch a shower of rain.  Where do the drops come from? and why\r\nare they round, or rather slightly oval?  In our fourth lecture\r\nwe shall se that the little particles of water of which the\r\nraindrops are made, were held apart and invisible in the air by\r\nheat, one of the most wonderful of our forces* or fairies, till\r\nthe cold wind passed by and chilled the air.  Then, when there\r\nwas no longer so much heat, another invisible force, cohesion,\r\nwhich is always ready and waiting, seized on the tiny particles\r\nat once, and locked them together in a drop, the closest form in\r\nwhich they could lie.  Then as the drops became larger and larger\r\nthey fell into the grasp of another invisible force, gravitation,\r\nwhich dragged them down to the earth, drop by drop, till they\r\nmade a shower of rain.  Pause for a moment and think.  You have\r\nsurely heard of gravitation, by which the sun holds the earth and\r\nthe planets, and keeps them moving round him in regular order?\r\nWell, it is this same gravitation which is a t work also whenever\r\na shower of rain falls to the earth.  Who can say that he is not\r\na great invisible giant, always silently and invisibly toiling in\r\ngreat things and small whether we wake or sleep?\r\n\r\n*(I am quite aware of the danger incurred by using this word\r\n\"force\", especially in the plural; and how even the most modest\r\nlittle book may suffer at the hands of scientific purists by\r\nemploying it rashly.  As, however, the better term \"energy\" would\r\nnot serve here, I hope I may be forgiven for retaining the much-\r\nabused term, especially as I sin in very good company.)\r\n\r\nNow the shower is over, the sun comes out and the ground is soon\r\nas dry as though no rain had fallen.  Tell me; what has become of\r\nthe rain-drops?  Part no doubt have sunk into the ground, and as\r\nfor the rest, why you will say the sun has dried them up.  Yes,\r\nbut how?  The sun is more than ninety-one millions of miles away;\r\nhow has he touched the rain-drops?  Have you ever heard that\r\ninvisible waves are travelling every second over the space\r\nbetween the sun and us?  We shall see in the next lecture how\r\nthese waves are the sun's messengers to the earth, and how they\r\ntear asunder the rain-drops on the ground, scattering them in\r\ntiny particles too small for us to see, and bearing them away to\r\nthe clouds.  Here are more invisible fairies working every moment\r\naround you, and you cannot even look out of the window without\r\nseeing the work they are doing.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the day is cold and frosty, the water does not fall\r\nin a shower of rain; it comes down in the shape of noiseless\r\nsnow.  Go out after such a snow-shower, on a calm day, and look\r\nat some of the flakes which have fallen; you will see, if you\r\nchoose good specimens, that they are not mere masses of frozen\r\nwater, but that each one is a beautiful six-pointed crystal star.\r\nHow have these crystals been built up?  What power has been at\r\nwork arranging their delicate forms?  In the fourth lecture we\r\nshall see that up in the clouds another of our invisible fairies,\r\nwhich, for want of a better name, we call the \"force of\r\ncrystallization,\" has caught hold of the tiny particles of water\r\nbefore \"cohesion\" had made them into round drops, and there\r\nsilently but rapidly, has moulded them into those delicate\r\ncrystal starts know as \"snowflakes\".\r\n\r\nAnd now, suppose that this snow-shower has fallen early in\r\nFebruary; turn aside for a moment from examining the flakes, and\r\nclear the newly-fallen snow from off the flower-bed on the lawn.\r\nWhat is this little green tip peeping up out of the ground under\r\nthe snowy covering?  It is a young snowdrop plant.  Can you tell\r\nme why it grows? where it finds its food? what makes it spread\r\nout its leaves and add to its stalk day by day?  What fairies are\r\nat work here?\r\n\r\nFirst there is the hidden fairy \"life,\" and of her even our\r\nwisest men know but little.  But they know something of her way\r\nof working, and in Lecture VII we shall learn how the invisible\r\nfairy sunbeams have been buy here also; how last year's snowdrop\r\nplant caught them and stored them up in it's bulb, and how now in\r\nthe spring, as soon as warmth and moisture creep down into the\r\nearth, these little imprisoned sun-waves begin to be active,\r\nstirring up the matter in the bulb, and making it swell and burst\r\nupwards till it sends out a little shoot through the surface of\r\nthe soil.  Then the sun-waves above-ground take up the work, and\r\nform green granules in the tiny leaves, helping them to take food\r\nout of the air, while the little rootlets below are drinking\r\nwater out of the ground.  The invisible life and invisible\r\nsunbeams are busy here, setting actively to work another fairy,\r\nthe force of \"chemical attraction,\" and so the little snowdrop\r\nplant grows and blossoms, without any help from you or me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 2\r\n\r\nOne picture more, and then I hope you will believe in my fairies.\r\nFrom the cold garden, you run into the house, and find the fire\r\nlaid indeed in the grate, but the wood dead and the coals black,\r\nwaiting to be lighted.  You strike a match, and soon there is a\r\nblazing fire.  Where does the heat come from?  Why do the coals\r\nburn and give out a glowing light?  Have you not read of gnomes\r\nburied down deep in the earth, in mines, and held fast there till\r\nsome fairy wand has released them, and allowed them to come to\r\nearth again?  Well, thousands and millions of years ago, those\r\ncoals were plants; and like the snowdrop in the garden of to-day,\r\nthey caught the sunbeams and worked them into their leaves.  Then\r\nthe plants died and were buried deep in the earth and the\r\nsunbeams with them; and like the gnomes they lay imprisoned till\r\nthe coals were dug out by the miners, and brought to your grate;\r\nand just now you yourself took hold of the fairy wand which was\r\nto release them.  You struck a match, and its atoms clashing with\r\natoms of oxygen in the air, set the invisible fairies \"heat\" and\r\n\"chemical attraction\" to work, and they were soon busy within the\r\nwood and the coals causing their atoms too to clash; and the\r\nsunbeams, so long imprisoned, leapt into flame.  Then you spread\r\nout your hands and cried, \"Oh, how nice and warm!\" and little\r\nthought that you were warming yourself with the sunbeams of ages\r\nand ages ago.\r\n\r\nThis is no fancy tale; it is literally true, as we shall see in\r\nLecture VIII, that the warmth of a coal fire could not exist if\r\nthe plants of long ago had not used the sunbeams to make their\r\nleaves, holding them ready to give up their warmth again whenever\r\nthose crushed leaves are consumed.\r\n\r\nNow, do you believe in, and care for, my fairy-land?  Can you see\r\nin your imagination fairy 'Cohesion' ever ready to lock atoms\r\ntogether when they draw very near to each other: or fairy\r\n'Gravitation' dragging rain-drops down to the earth: or the fairy\r\nof 'Crystallization' building up the snow-flakes in the clouds?\r\nCan you picture tiny sunbeam-waves of light and heat travelling\r\nfrom the sun to the earth?  Do you care to know how another\r\nstrange fairy, 'Electricity,' flings the lightning across the sky\r\nand causes the rumbling thunder?  Would you like to learn how the\r\nsun makes pictures of the world on which he shines, so that we\r\ncan carry about with us photographs or sun-pictures of all the\r\nbeautiful scenery of the earth?  And have you any curiosity about\r\n'Chemical action,' which works such wonders in air, and land, and\r\nsea?  If you have any wish to know and make friends of these\r\ninvisible forces, the next question is\r\n\r\nHow are you to enter the fairy-land of science?\r\n\r\nThere is but one way.  Like the knight or peasant in the fairy\r\ntales, you must open you eyes.  There is no lack of objects,\r\neverything around you will tell some history if touched with the\r\nfairy wand of imagination.  I have often thought, when seeing\r\nsome sickly child drawn along the street, lying on its back while\r\nother children romp and play, how much happiness might be given\r\nto sick children at home or in hospitals, if only they were told\r\nthe stories which lie hidden in the things around them.  They\r\nneed not even move from their beds, for sunbeams can fall on them\r\nthere, and in a sunbeam there are stories enough to occupy a\r\nmonth.  The fire in the grate, the lamp by the bedside, the water\r\nin the tumbler, the fly on the ceiling above, the flower in the\r\nvase on the table, anything, everything, has its history, and can\r\nreveal to us nature's invisible fairies.\r\n\r\nOnly you must with to see them.  If you go through the world\r\nlooking upon everything only as so much to eat, to drink, and to\r\nuse, you will never see the fairies of science.  But if you ask\r\nyourself why things happen, and how the great God above us has\r\nmade and governs this world of ours; If you listen to the wind,\r\nand care to learn why it blows; if you ask the little flower why\r\nit opens in the sunshine and closes in the storm; and if when you\r\nfind questions you cannot answer, you will take the trouble to\r\nhunt out in books, or make experiments to solve your own\r\nquestions, then you will learn to know and love those fairies.\r\n\r\nMind, I do not advise you to be constantly asking questions of\r\nother people; for often a question quickly answered is quickly\r\nforgotten, but a difficulty really hunted down is a triumph for\r\never.  For example, if you ask why the rain dries up from the\r\nground, most likely you will be answered, \"that the sun dries\r\nit,\" and you will rest satisfied with the sound of the words.\r\nBut if you hold a wet handkerchief before the fire and see the\r\ndamp rising out of it, then you have some real idea how moisture\r\nmay be drawn up by heat from the earth.\r\n\r\nA little foreign niece of mine, only four years old, who could\r\nscarcely speak English plainly, was standing one morning near the\r\nbedroom window and she noticed the damp trickling down the\r\nwindow-pane.  \"Auntie,\" she said, \"what for it rain inside?\"  It\r\nwas quite useless to explain to her in words, how our breath had\r\ncondensed into drops of water upon the cold glass; but I wiped\r\nthe pane clear, and breathed on it several times.  When new drops\r\nwere formed, I said, \"Cissy and auntie have done like this all\r\nnight in the room.\"  She nodded her little head and amused\r\nherself for a long time breathing on the window-pane and watching\r\nthe tiny drops; and about a month later, when we were travelling\r\nback to Italy, I saw her following the drops on the carriage\r\nwindow with her little finger, and heard her say quietly to\r\nherself, \"Cissy and auntie made you.\"  Had not even this little\r\nchild some real picture in her mind of invisible water coming\r\nfrom her mouth, and making drops upon the window-pane?\r\n\r\nThen again, you must learn something of the language of science.\r\nIf you travel in a country with no knowledge of its language, you\r\ncan learn very little about it: and in the same way if you are to\r\ngo to books to find answers to your questions, you must know\r\nsomething of the language they speak.  You need not learn hard\r\nscientific names, for the best books have the fewest of these,\r\nbut you must really understand what is meant by ordinary words.\r\n\r\nFor example, how few people can really explain the difference\r\nbetween a solid, such as the wood of the table; a liquid, as\r\nwater; and a gas, such as I can let off from this gas-jet by\r\nturning the tap.  And yet any child can make a picture of this in\r\nhis mind if only it has been properly put before him.\r\n\r\nAll matter in the world is made up of minute parts or particles;\r\nin a solid these particles are locked together so tightly that\r\nyou must tear them forcibly apart if you with to alter the shape\r\nof the solid piece.  If I break or bend this wood I have to force\r\nthe particles to move round each other, and I have great\r\ndifficulty doing it.  But in a liquid, though the particles are\r\nstill held together, they do not cling so tightly, but are able\r\nto roll or glide round each other, so that when you pour water\r\nout of a cup on to a table, it loses its cuplike shape and\r\nspreads itself out flat.  Lastly, in a gas the particles are no\r\nlonger held together at all, but they try to fly away from each\r\nother; and unless you shut a gas in tightly and safely, it will\r\nsoon have spread all over the room.\r\n\r\nA solid, therefore, will retain the same bulk and shape unless\r\nyou forcibly alter it; a liquid will retain the same bulk, but no\r\nthe same shape if it be left free; a gas will not retain either\r\nthe same bulk or the same shape, but will spread over as large a\r\nspace as it can find wherever it can penetrate.  Such simple\r\nthings as these you must learn from books and by experiment.\r\n\r\nThen you must understand what is meant by chemical attraction;\r\nand though I can explain this roughly here, you will have to make\r\nmany interesting experiments before you will really learn to know\r\nthis wonderful fairy power.  If I dissolve sugar in water, though\r\nit disappears it still remains sugar, and does not join itself to\r\nthe water.  I have only to let the cup stand till the water\r\ndries, and the sugar will remain at the bottom.  There has been\r\nno chemical attraction here.\r\n\r\nBut now I will put something else in water which will call up the\r\nfairy power.  Here is a little piece of the metal potassium, one\r\nof the simple substances of the earth; that is to say, we cannot\r\nsplit it up into other substances, wherever we find it, it is\r\nalways the same.  Now if I put this piece of potassium on the\r\nwater it does not disappear quietly like the sugar.  See how it\r\nrolls round and round, fizzing violently with a blue flame\r\nburning round it, and at last goes off with a pop.\r\n\r\nWhat has been happening here?\r\n\r\nYou must first know that water is made of two substances,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, and these are not merely held together, but\r\nare joined to completely that they have lost themselves and have\r\nbecome water; and each atom of water is made of two atoms of\r\nhydrogen and one of oxygen.\r\n\r\nNow the metal potassium is devotedly fond of oxygen, and the\r\nmoment I threw it on the water it called the fairy \"chemical\r\nattraction' to help it, and dragged the atoms of oxygen out of\r\nthe water and joined them to itself.  In doing this it also\r\ncaught part of the hydrogen, but only half, and so the rest was\r\nleft out in the cold.  No, not in the cold! for the potassium and\r\noxygen made such a great heat in clashing together that the rest\r\nof the hydrogen became very hot indeed, and sprang into the air\r\nto find some other companion to make up for what it had lost.\r\nHere it found some free oxygen floating about, and it seized upon\r\nit so violently, that they made a burning flame, while the\r\npotassium with its newly found oxygen and hydrogen sank down\r\nquietly into the water as potash.  And so you see we have got\r\nquite a new substance potash in the basin; made with a great deal\r\nof fuss by chemical attraction drawing different atoms together.\r\n\r\nWhen you can really picture this power to yourself it will help\r\nyou very much to understand what you read and observe about\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nNext, as plants grow around you on every side, and are of so much\r\nimportance in the world, you must also learn something of the\r\nnames of the different parts of a flower, so that you may\r\nunderstand those books which explain how a plant grows and lives\r\nand forms its seeds.  You must also know the common names of the\r\nparts of an animal, and of your own body, so that you may be\r\ninterested in understanding the use of the different organs; how\r\nyou breathe, and how your blood flows; how one animal walks,\r\nanother flies, and another swims.  Then you must learn something\r\nof the various parts of the world, so that you may know what is\r\nmeant by a river, a plain, a valley, or a delta.  All these\r\nthings are not difficult, you can learn them pleasantly from\r\nsimple books on physics, chemistry, botany, physiology, and\r\nphysical geography; and when you understand a few plain\r\nscientific terms, then all by yourself, if you will open your\r\neyes and ears, you may wander happily in the fairy-land of\r\nscience.  Then wherever you go you will find\r\n\r\n \"Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks\r\n  Sermons in stones, and good in everything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the last part of our subject.  When you have\r\nreached and entered the gates of science, how are you to use and\r\nenjoy this new and beautiful land?\r\n\r\nThis is a very important question for you may make a twofold use\r\nof it.  If you are only ambitious to shine in the world, you may\r\nuse it chiefly to get prizes, to be at the top of your class, or\r\nto pass in examinations; but if you also enjoy discovering its\r\nsecrets, and desire to learn more and more of nature and to revel\r\nin dreams of its beauty, then you will study science for its own\r\nsake as well.  Now it is a good thing to win prizes and be at the\r\ntop of your class, for it shows that you are industrious; it is a\r\ngood thing to pass well in examinations , for it show that you\r\nare accurate; but if you study science for this reason only, do\r\nnot complain if you find it full, and dry, and hard to master.\r\nYou may learn a great deal that is useful, and nature will answer\r\nyou truthfully if you ask you questions accurately, but she will\r\ngive you dry facts, just such as you ask for.  If you do not love\r\nher for herself she will never take you to her heart.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why so many complain that science is dry and\r\nuninteresting.  They forget that though it is necessary to learn\r\naccurately, for so only we can arrive at truth, it is equally\r\nnecessary to love knowledge and make it lovely to those who\r\nlearn, and to do this we must get at the spirit which lies under\r\nthe facts.  What child which loves its mother's face is content\r\nto know only that she has brown eyes, a straight nose, a small\r\nmouth, and hair arranged in such and such a manner?  No, it knows\r\nthat its mother has the sweetest smile of any woman living; that\r\nher eyes are loving, her kiss is sweet, and that when she looks\r\ngrave, then something is wrong which must be put right.  And it\r\nis in this way that those who wish to enjoy the fairy-land of\r\nscience must love nature.\r\n\r\nIt is well to know that when a piece of potassium is thrown on\r\nwater the change which takes place is expressed by the formula K +\r\nH2O = KHO + H. But it is better still to have a mental picture of\r\nthe tiny atoms clasping each other, and mingling so as to make a\r\nnew substance, and to feel how wonderful are the many changing\r\nforms of nature. It is useful to be able to classify a flower and\r\nto know that the buttercup belongs to the Family Ranunculaceae,\r\nwith petals free and definite, stamens hypogynous and indefinite,\r\npistil apocarpous. But it is far sweeter to learn about the life\r\nof the little plant, to understand why its peculiar flower is\r\nuseful to it, and how it feeds itself, and makes its seed. No one\r\ncan love dry facts; we must clothe them with real meaning and love\r\nthe truths they tell, if we wish to enjoy science.\r\n\r\nLet us take an example to show this.  I have here a branch of\r\nwhite coral, a beautiful, delicate piece of nature's work.  We\r\nwill begin by copying a description of it from one of those\r\nclass-books which suppose children to learn words like parrots,\r\nand to repeat them with just as little understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Coral is formed by an animal belonging to the kingdom of\r\nRadiates, sub-kingdom Polypes.  The soft body of the animal is\r\nattached to a support, the mouth opening upwards in a row of\r\ntentacles.  The coral is secreted in the body of the polyp out of\r\nthe carbonate of lime in the sea.  Thus the coral animalcule\r\nrears its polypidom or rocky structure in warm latitudes, and\r\nconstructs reefs or barriers round islands.  It is limited in\r\nrage of depth from 25 to 30 fathoms.  Chemically considered,\r\ncoral is carbonate of like; physiologically, it is the skeleton\r\nof an animal; geographically, it is characteristic of warm\r\nlatitudes, especially of the Pacific Ocean.\"  This description is\r\ncorrect, and even fairly complete, if you know enough of the\r\nsubject to understand it.  But tell me, does it lead you to love\r\nmy piece of coral?  Have you any picture in your mind of the\r\ncoral animal, its home, or its manner of working?\r\n\r\nBut now, instead of trying to master this dry, hard passage, take\r\nMr. Huxley's penny lecture on 'Coral and Coral Reefs,' and with\r\nthe piece of coral in your hand try really to learn its history.\r\nYou will then be able to picture to yourself the coral animal as\r\na kind of sea-anemone, something like those which you have often\r\nseen, like red, blue, or green flowers, putting out feelers in\r\nsea-water on our coasts, and drawing in the tiny sea-animals to\r\ndigest them in that bag of fluid which serves the sea-anemone as\r\na stomach.  You will learn how this curious jelly animal can\r\nsplit itself in two, and so form two polyps, or send a bud out of\r\nits side and so grow up into a kind of \"tree or bush of polyps,\"\r\nor how it can hatch little eggs inside it and throw out young\r\nones from its mouth, provided with little hairs, by means of\r\nwhich they swim to new resting-places.  You will learn the\r\ndifference between the animal which builds up the red coral as\r\nits skeleton, and the group of animals which build up the white;\r\nand you will look with new interest on our piece of white coral,\r\nas you read that each of those little sups on its stem with\r\ndelicate divisions like the spokes of a wheel has been the home\r\nof a separate polyp, and that from the sea-water each little\r\njelly animal has drunk in carbonate of lime as you drink in sugar\r\ndissolved in water, and then has used it grain by grain to build\r\nthat delicate cup and add to the coral tree.\r\n\r\nWe cannot stop to examine all about coral now, we are only\r\nlearning how to learn, but surely our specimen is already\r\nbeginning to grow interesting; and when you have followed it out\r\ninto the great Pacific Ocean, where the wild waves dash\r\nrestlessly against the coral trees, and have seen these tiny\r\ndrops of jelly conquering the sea and building huge walls of\r\nstone against the rough breakers, you will hardly rest till you\r\nknow all their history.  Look at that curious circular island in\r\nthe picture, covered with palm trees; it has a large smooth lake\r\nin the middle, and the bottom of this lake is covered with blue,\r\nred, and green jelly animals, spreading out their feelers in the\r\nwater and looking like beautiful flowers, and all round the\r\noutside of the island similar animals are to be seen washed by\r\nthe sea waves.  Such islands as this have been build entirely by\r\nthe coral animals, and the history of the way in which the reefs\r\nhave sunk gradually down, as the tiny creatures added to them\r\ninch by inch, is as fascinating as the story of the building of\r\nany fairy palace in the days of old.  Read all this, and then if\r\nyou have no coral of your own to examine, go to the British\r\nMuseum and see the beautiful specimens in the glass cases there,\r\nand think that they have been built up under the rolling surf by\r\nthe tiny jelly animals; and then coral will become a real living\r\nthing to you, and you will love the thoughts it awakens.\r\n\r\nBut people often ask, what is the use of learning all this?  If\r\nyou do not feel by this time how delightful it is to fill your\r\nmind with beautiful pictures of nature, perhaps it would be\r\nuseless to say more.  But in this age of ours, when restlessness\r\nand love of excitement pervade so many lives, is it nothing to be\r\ntaken out of ourselves and made to look at the wonders of nature\r\ngoing on around us?  Do you never feel tired and \"out of sorts,\"\r\nand want to creep away from your companions, because they are\r\nmerry and you are not?  Then is the time to read about the\r\nstarts, and how quietly they keep their course from age to age;\r\nor to visit some little flower, and ask what story it has to\r\ntell; or to watch the clouds, and try to imagine how the winds\r\ndrive them across the sky.  No person is so independent as he who\r\ncan find interest in a bare rock, a drop of water, the foam of\r\nthe sea, the spider on the wall, the flower underfoot or the\r\nstarts overhead.  And these interests are open to everyone who\r\nenters the fairy-land of science.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we learn from this study to see that there is a law and\r\npurpose in everything in the Universe, and it makes us patient\r\nwhen we recognize the quiet noiseless working of nature all\r\naround us.  Study light, and learn how all colour, beauty, and\r\nlife depend on the sun's rays; note the winds and currents of the\r\nair, regular even in their apparent irregularity, as they carry\r\nheat and moisture all over the world.  Watch the water flowing in\r\ndeep quiet streams, or forming the vast ocean; and then reflect\r\nthat every drop is guided by invisible forces working according\r\nto fixed laws.  See plants springing up under the sunlight, learn\r\nthe secrets of plant life, and how their scents and colours\r\nattract the insects.  Read how insects cannot live without\r\nplants, nor plants without the flitting butterfly or the busy\r\nbee.  Realize that all this is worked by fixed laws, and that out\r\nof it (even if sometimes in suffering and pain) springs the\r\nwonderful universe around us.  And then say, can you fear for\r\nyour own little life, even though it may have its troubles?  Can\r\nyou help feeling a part of this guided and governed nature? or\r\ndoubt that the power which fixed the laws of the stars and of the\r\ntiniest drop of water - that made the plant draw power from the\r\nsun, the tine coral animal its food from the dashing waves; that\r\nadapted the flower to the insect and the insect to the flower -\r\nis also moulding your life as part of the great machinery of the\r\nuniverse, so that you have only to work, and to wait, and to\r\nlove?\r\n\r\nWe are all groping dimly for the Unseen Power, but no one who\r\nloves nature and studies it can ever feel alone or unloved in the\r\nworld.  Facts, as mere facts, are dry and barren, but nature is\r\nfull of life and love, and her calm unswerving rule is tending to\r\nsome great though hidden purpose.  You may call this Unseen Power\r\nwhat you will - may lean on it in loving, trusting faith, or bend\r\nin reverent and silent awe; but even the little child who lives\r\nwith nature and gazes on her with open eye, must rise in some\r\nsense or other through nature to nature's God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 3\r\n\r\nLecture II Sunbeams and How They Work\r\n\r\nWho does not love the sunbeams, and feel brighter and merrier as\r\nhe watches them playing on the wall, sparkling like diamonds on\r\nthe ripples of the sea, or making bows of coloured light on the\r\nwaterfall?  Is not the sunbeam so dear to us that it has become a\r\nhousehold word for all that is merry and gay? and when we want to\r\ndescribe the dearest, busiest little sprite amongst us, who wakes\r\na smile on all faces wherever she goes, do we not call her the\r\n\"sunbeam of the house\"?\r\n\r\nAnd yet how little even the wisest among us know about the nature\r\nand work of these bright messengers of the sun as they dart\r\nacross space!\r\n\r\nDid you ever wake quite early in the morning, when it was pitch-\r\ndark and you could see nothing, not even your own hand; and then\r\nlie watching as time went on till the light came gradually\r\ncreeping in at the window?  If you have done this you will have\r\nnoticed that you can at first only just distinguish the dim\r\noutline of the furniture; then you can tell the difference\r\nbetween the white cloth on the table and the dark wardrobe beside\r\nit; then by degrees all the smaller details, the handles of the\r\ndrawer, the pattern on the wall, and the different colours of all\r\nthe objects in the room become clearer and clearer till at last\r\nyou see all distinctly in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nWhat has been happening here? and why have the things in the room\r\nbecome visible by such slow degrees?  We say that the sun is\r\nrising, but we know very well that it is not the sun which moves,\r\nbut that our earth has been turning slowly round, and bringing\r\nthe little spot on which we live face to face with the great\r\nfiery ball, so that his beams can fall upon us.\r\n\r\nTake a small globe, and stick a piece of black plaster over\r\nEngland, then let a lighted lamp represent the sun, and turn the\r\nglobe slowly, so that the spot creeps round from the dark side\r\naway from the lamp, until it catches, first the rays which pass\r\nalong the side of the globe, then the more direct rays, and at\r\nlast stands fully in the blaze of the light.  Just this was\r\nhappening to our spot of the world as you lay in bed and saw the\r\nlight appear; and we have to learn today what those beams are\r\nwhich fall upon us and what they do for us.\r\n\r\nFirst we must learn something about the sun itself, since it is\r\nthe starting-place of all the sunbeams.  If the sun were a dark\r\nmass instead of a fiery one we should have none of these bright\r\ncheering messengers, and though we were turned face to face with\r\nhim every day we should remain in one cold eternal night.  Now\r\nyou will remember we mentioned in the last lecture that it is\r\nheat which shakes apart the little atoms of water and makes them\r\ngloat up in the air to fall again as rain; and that if the day is\r\ncold they fall as snow, and all the water is turned into ice.\r\nBut if the sun were altogether dark, think how bitterly cold it\r\nwould be; far colder than the most wintry weather ever known,\r\nbecause in the bitterest night some warmth comes out of the\r\nearth, where it has been stored from the sunlight which fell\r\nduring the day.  But if we never received any warmth at all, no\r\nwater would ever rise up into the sky, no rain ever fall, no\r\nrivers flow, and consequently no plants could grow and no animals\r\nlive.  All water would be in the form of snow and ice, and the\r\nearth would be one great frozen mass with nothing moving upon it.\r\n\r\nSo you see it becomes very interesting for us to learn what the\r\nsun is, and how he sends us his beams.  How far away from us do\r\nyou think he is?  On a fine summer's day when we can see him\r\nclearly, it looks as if we had only to get into a balloon and\r\nreach him as he sits in the sky, and yet we know roughly that he\r\nis more than ninety-one millions of miles distant from our earth.\r\n\r\nThese figures are so enormous that you cannot really grasp them.\r\nBut imagine yourself in an express train, travelling at the\r\ntremendous rate of sixty miles an hour and never stopping.  At\r\nthat rate, if you wished to arrive at the sun today you would\r\nhave been obliged to start 171 years ago.  That is, you must have\r\nset off in the early part of the reign of Queen Anne, and you\r\nmust have gone on, never, never resting, through the reigns of\r\nGeorge I, George ii, and the long reign of George III, then\r\nthrough those of George IV, William IV, and Victoria, whirling on\r\nday and night at express speed, and at last, today, you would\r\nhave reached the sun!\r\n\r\nAnd when you arrived there, how large do you think you would find\r\nhim to be?  Anaxagoras, a learned Greek, was laughed at by all\r\nhis fellow Greeks because he said that the sun was as large as\r\nthe Peloponne-sus, that is about the size of Middlesex.  How\r\nastonished they would have been if they could have known that not\r\nonly is he bigger than the whole of Greece, but more than a\r\nmillion times bigger than the whole world!\r\n\r\nOur world itself is a very large place, so large that our own\r\ncountry looks only like a tiny speck upon it, and an express\r\ntrain would take nearly a month to travel round it.  Yet even our\r\nwhole globe is nothing in size compared to the sun, for it only\r\nmeasures 8000 miles across, while the sun measures more the\r\n852,000.\r\n\r\nImagine for a moment that you could cut the sun and the earth\r\neach in half as you would cut an apple; then if you were to lay\r\nthe flat side of the half-earth on the flat side of the half sun\r\nit would take 106 such earths to stretch across the face of the\r\nsun.  One of these 106 round spots on the diagram represents the\r\nsize which our earth would look if placed on the sun; and they\r\nare so tiny compared to him that they look only like a string of\r\nminute beads stretched across his face.  Only think, then, how\r\nmany of these minute dots would be required to fill the whole of\r\nthe inside of Fig. 4, if it were a globe.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to form an idea of the whole size of the sun\r\nis to imagine it to be hollow, like an air-ball, and then see how\r\nmany earths it would take to fill it.  You would hardly believe\r\nthat it would take one million, three hundred and thirty-one\r\nthousand globes the size of our world squeezed together.  Just\r\nthink, if a huge giant could travel all over the universe and\r\ngather worlds, all as big as ours, and were to make first a heap\r\nof merely ten such worlds, how huge it would be!  Then he must\r\nhave a hundred such heaps of ten to make a thousand world; and\r\nthen he must collect again a thousand times that thousand to make\r\na million, and when he had stuffed them all into the sun-ball he\r\nwould still have only filled three-quarters of it!\r\n\r\nAfter hearing this you will not be astonished that such a monster\r\nshould give out an enormous quantity of light and heat; so\r\nenormous that it is almost impossible to form any idea of it.\r\nSir John Herschel has, indeed, tried to picture it for us.  He\r\nfound that a ball of lime with a flame of oxygen and hydrogen\r\nplaying round it (such as we use in magic lanterns and call oxy-\r\nhydrogen light) becomes so violently hot that it gives the most\r\nbrilliant artificial light we can get - such that you cannot put\r\nyour eye near it without injury.  Yet if you wanted to have a\r\nlight as strong as that of our sun, it would not be enough to\r\nmake such a lime-ball as big as the sun is.  No, you must make it\r\nas big as 146 suns, or more than 146,000,000 times as big as our\r\nearth, in order to get the right amount of light.  Then you would\r\nhave a tolerably good artificial sun; for we know that the body\r\nof the sun gives out an intense white light, just as the lime-\r\nball does, and that , like it, it has an atmosphere of glowing\r\ngases round it.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we get the best idea of the mighty heat and light of\r\nthe sun by remembering how few of the rays which dart out on all\r\nsides from this fiery ball can reach our tiny globe, and yet how\r\npowerful they are.  Look at the globe of a lamp in the middle of\r\nthe room, and see how its light pours out on all sides and into\r\nevery corner; then take a grain of mustard-seed, which will very\r\nwell represent the comparative size of our earth, and hold it up\r\nat a distance from the lamp.  How very few of all those rays\r\nwhich are filling the room fall on the little mustard-seed, and\r\njust so few does our earth catch of the rays which dart out from\r\nthe sun.  And yet this small quantity (1/2000-millionth part of\r\nthe whole) does nearly all the work of our world.  (These and the\r\npreceding numerical statements will be found worked out in Sir J.\r\nHerschel's 'Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects,' 1868, from\r\nwhich many of the facts in the first part of the lecture are\r\ntaken.)\r\n\r\nIn order to see how powerful the sun's rays are, you have only to\r\ntake a magnifying glass and gather them to a point on a piece of\r\nbrown paper, for they will set the paper alight.  Sir John\r\nHerschel tells us that at the Cape of Good Hope the heat was even\r\nso great that he cooked a beefsteak and roasted some eggs by\r\nmerely putting them in the sun, in a box with a glass lid!\r\nIndeed, just as we should all be frozen to death if the sun were\r\nsold, so we should all be burnt up with intolerable heat if his\r\nfierce rays fell with all their might upon us.  But we have an\r\ninvisible veil protecting us, made - of what do you think?  Of\r\nthose tiny particles of water which the sunbeams draw up and\r\nscatter in the air, and which, as we shall see in Lecture IV, cut\r\noff part of the intense heat and make the air cool and pleasant\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 4\r\n\r\nWe have now learnt something of the distance, the size, the\r\nlight, and the heat of the sun - the great source of the\r\nsunbeams.  But we are as yet no nearer the answer to the\r\nquestion, What is a sunbeam? how does the sun touch our earth?\r\n\r\nNow suppose I with to touch you from this platform where I stand,\r\nI can do it in two ways.  Firstly, I can throw something at you\r\nand hit you - in this case a thing will have passed across the\r\nspace from me to you.  Or, secondly, if I could make a violent\r\nmovement so as to shake the floor of the room, you would feel a\r\nquivering motion; and so I should touch you across the whole\r\ndistance of the room.  But in this case no thing would have\r\npassed from me to you but a movement or wave, which passed along\r\nthe boards of the floor.  Again, if I speak to you, how does the\r\nsound reach you ear?  Not by anything being thrown from my mouth\r\nto your ear, but by the motion of the air.  When I speak I\r\nagitate the air near my mouth, and that makes a wave in the air\r\nbeyond, and that one, another, and another (as we shall see more\r\nfully in Lecture VI) till the last wave hits the drum of your\r\near.\r\n\r\nThus we see there are two ways of touching anything at a\r\ndistance; 1st, by throwing some thing at it and hitting it; 2nd,\r\nby sending a movement of wave across to it, as in the case of the\r\nquivering boards and the air.\r\n\r\nNow the great natural philosopher Newton thought that the sun\r\ntouched us in the first of these ways, and that sunbeams were\r\nmade of very minute atoms of matter thrown out by the sun, and\r\nmaking a perpetual cannonade on our eyes.  It is easy to\r\nunderstand that this would make us see light and feel heat, just\r\nas a blow in the eye makes us see starts, or on the body makes it\r\nfeel hot: and for a long time this explanation was supposed to be\r\nthe true one.  But we know now that there are many facts which\r\ncannot be explained on this theory, though we cannot go into them\r\nhere.  What we will do, is to try and understand what now seems\r\nto be the true explanation of the sunbeam.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Newton wrote, a Dutchman, named\r\nHuyghens, suggested that light comes from the sun in tiny waves,\r\ntravelling across space much in the same way as ripples travel\r\nacross a pond.  The only difficulty was to explain in what\r\nsubstance these waves could be travelling: not through water, for\r\nwe know that there is no water in space - nor through air, for\r\nthe air stops at a comparatively short distance from our earth.\r\nThere must then be something filling all space between us and the\r\nsun, finer than either water or air.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must ask you to use all you imagination, for I want you\r\nto picture to yourselves something quite as invisible as the\r\nEmperor's new clothes in Andersen's fairy-tale, only with this\r\ndifference, that our invisible something is very active; and\r\nthough we can neither see it nor touch it we know it by its\r\neffects.  You must imagine a fine substance filling all space\r\nbetween us and the sun and the starts.  A substance so very\r\ndelicate and subtle, that not only is it invisible, but it can\r\npass through solid bodies such as glass, ice, or even wood or\r\nbrick walls.  This substance we call \"ether.\"  I cannot give you\r\nhere the reasons why we must assume that it is throughout all\r\nspace; you must take this on the word of such men as Sir John\r\nHerschel or Professor Clerk-Maxwell, until you can study the\r\nquestion for yourselves.\r\n\r\nNow if you can imagine this ether filling every corner of space,\r\nso that it is everywhere and passes through everything, ask\r\nyourselves, what must happen when a great commotion is going on\r\nin one of the large bodies which float in it?  When the atoms of\r\nthe gases round the sun are clashing violently together to make\r\nall its light and heat, do you not think they must shake this\r\nether all around them?  And then, since the ether stretches on\r\nall sides from the sun to our earth and all other planets, must\r\nnot this quivering travel to us, just as the quivering of the\r\nboards would from me to you?  Take a basin of water to represent\r\nthe ether, and take a piece of potassium like that which we used\r\nin our last lecture, and hold it with a pair of nippers in the\r\nmiddle of the water.  You will see that as the potassium hisses\r\nand the flame burns round it, they will make waves which will\r\ntravel all over the water to the edge of the basin,, and you can\r\nimagine how in the same way waves travel over the ether from the\r\nsun to us.\r\n\r\nStraight away from the sun on all sides, never stopping, never\r\nresting, but chasing after each other with marvellous quickness,\r\nthese tiny waves travel out into space by night and by day.  When\r\nour spot of the earth where England lies is turned away from them\r\nand they cannot touch us, then it is night for us, but directly\r\nEngland is turned so as to face the sun, then they strike on the\r\nland, and the water, and warm it; or upon our eyes, making the\r\nnerves quiver so that we see light.  Look up at the sun and\r\npicture to yourself that instead of one great blow from a fist\r\ncausing you to see starts for a moment, millions of tiny blows\r\nfrom these sun-waves are striking every instant on you eye; then\r\nyou will easily understand that his would cause you to see a\r\nconstant blaze of light.\r\n\r\nBut when the sun is away, if the night is clear we have light\r\nfrom the starts.  Do these then too make waves all across the\r\nenormous distance between them and us?  Certainly they do, for\r\nthey too are suns like our own, only they are so far off that the\r\nwaves they send are more feeble, and so we only notice them when\r\nthe sun's stronger waves are away.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you will ask, if no one has ever seen these waves not\r\nthe ether in which they are made, what right have we to say they\r\nare there?  Strange as it may seem, though we cannot see them we\r\nhave measured them and know how large they are, and how many can\r\ngo into an inch of space.  For as these tiny waves are running on\r\nstraight forward through the room, if we put something in their\r\nway, they will have to run round it; and if you let in a very\r\nnarrow ray of light through a shutter and put an upright wire in\r\nthe sunbeam, you actually make the waves run round the wire just\r\nas water runs round a post in a river; and they meet behind the\r\nwire, just as the water meets in a V shape behind the post.  Now\r\nwhen they meet, they run up against each other, and here it is we\r\ncatch them.  Fir if they meet comfortably, both rising up in a\r\ngood wave, they run on together and make a bright line of light;\r\nbut if they meet higgledy-piggledy, one up and the other down,\r\nall in confusion, they stop each other, and then there is no\r\nlight but a line of darkness.  And so behind your piece of wire\r\nyou can catch the waves on a piece of paper, and you will find\r\nthey make dark and light lines one side by side with the other,\r\nand by means of these bands it is possible to find out how large\r\nthe waves must be.  This question is too difficult for us to work\r\nit out here, but you can see that large waves will make broader\r\nlight and dark bands than small ones will, and that in this way\r\nthe size of the waves may be measured.\r\n\r\nAnd now how large do you think they turn out to be?  so very,\r\nvery tiny that about fifty thousand waves are contained in a\r\nsingle inch of space!  I have drawn on the board the length of an\r\ninch, and now I will measure the same space in the air between my\r\nfinger and thumb.  Within this space at this moment there are\r\nfifty thousand tiny waves moving up and down.  I promised you we\r\nwould find in science things as wonderful as in fairy tales.  Are\r\nnot these tiny invisible messengers coming incessantly from the\r\nsun as wonderful as any fairies? and still more so when, as we\r\nshall see presently, they are doing nearly all the work of our\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe must next try to realize how fast these waves travel.  You\r\nwill remember that an express train would take 171 years to reach\r\nus from the sun; and even a cannon-ball would take from ten to\r\nthirteen years to come that distance.  Well, these tiny waves\r\ntake only seven minutes and a half to come the whole 91 millions\r\nof miles.  The waves which are hitting your eye at this moment\r\nare caused by a movement which began at the sun only 7 1/2\r\nminutes ago.  And remember, this movement is going on\r\nincessantly, and these waves are always following one after the\r\nother so rapidly that they keep up a perpetual cannonade upon the\r\npupil of your eye.  So fast do they come that about 608 billion\r\nwaves enter your eye in one single second.*  I do not ask you to\r\nremember these figures; I only ask you to try and picture to\r\nyourselves these infinitely tiny and active invisible messengers\r\nfrom the sun, and to acknowledge that light is a fairy thing.\r\n(*Light travels at the rate of 190,000 miles, or 12,165,120,000\r\ninches in a second.  Taking the average number of wave-lengths in\r\nan inch at 50,000, then 12,165,120,000 X 50,000 =\r\n608,256,000,000,000.)\r\n\r\nBut we do not yet know all about our sunbeams.  See, I have here\r\na piece of glass with three sides, called a prism.  If I put it\r\nin the sunlight which is streaming through the window, what\r\nhappens?  Look! on the table there is a line of beautiful\r\ncolours.  I can make it long or short, as I turn the prism, but\r\nthe colours always remain arranged in the same way.  Here at my\r\nleft hand is the red, beyond it orange, then yellow, green, blue,\r\nindigo or deep blue, and violet, shading one into the other all\r\nalong the line.  We have all seen these colours dancing on the\r\nwall when the sun has been shining brightly on the cut-glass\r\npendants of the chandelier, and you may see them still more\r\ndistinctly if you let a ray of light into a darkened room, and\r\npass it through the prism as in the diagram (Fig. 7).  What are\r\nthese colours?  Do they come from the glass?  No; for you will\r\nremember to have seen them in the rainbow, and in the soap-\r\nbubble, and even in a drop of dew or the scum on the top of a\r\npond.  This beautiful coloured line is only our sunbeam again,\r\nwhich has been split up into many colours by passing through the\r\nglass, as it is in the rain-drops of the rainbow and the bubbles\r\nof the scum of the pond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 5\r\n\r\nTill now we have talked of the sunbeam as if it were made of only\r\none set of waves of different sizes, all travelling along\r\ntogether from the sun.  These various waves have been measured,\r\nand we know that the waves which make up red light are larger and\r\nmore lazy than those which make violet light, so that there are\r\nonly thirty-nine thousand red waves in an inch, while there are\r\nfifty-seven thousand violet waves in the same space.\r\n\r\nHow is it then, that if all these different waves making\r\ndifferent colours, hit on our eye, they do not always make us see\r\ncoloured light?  Because, unless they are interfered with, they\r\nall travel along together, and you know that all colours, mixed\r\ntogether in proper proportion, make white.\r\n\r\nI have here a round piece of cardboard, painted with the seven\r\ncolours in succession several times over.  When it is still you\r\ncan distinguish them all apart, but when I whirl it quickly round\r\n- see! - the cardboard looks quite white, because we see them all\r\nso instantaneously that they are mingled together.  In the same\r\nway light looks white to you, because all the different coloured\r\nwaves strike on your eye at once.  You can easily make on of\r\nthese card for yourselves only the white will always look dirty,\r\nbecause you cannot get the colours pure.\r\n\r\nNow, when the light passes through the three-sided glass or\r\nprism, the waves are spread out, and the slow, heavy, red waves\r\nlag behind and remain at the lower end R of the coloured line on\r\nthe wall (Fig. 7), while the rapid little violet waves are bent\r\nmore out of their road and run to V at the farther end of the\r\nline; and the orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo arrange\r\nthemselves between, according to the size of their waves.\r\n\r\nAnd now you are very likely eager to ask why the quick waves\r\nshould make us see one colour, and the slow waves another.  This\r\nis a very difficult question, for we have a great deal still to\r\nlearn about the effect of light on the eye.  But you can easily\r\nimagine that colour is to our eye much the same as music is to\r\nour ear.  You know we can distinguish different notes when the\r\nair-waves play slowly or quickly upon the drum of the ear (as we\r\nshall see in Lecture VI) and somewhat in the same way the tiny\r\nwaves of the ether play on the retina or curtain at the back of\r\nour eye, and make the nerves carry different messages to the\r\nbrain: and the colour we see depends upon the number of waves\r\nwhich play upon the retina in a second.\r\n\r\nDo you think we have now rightly answered the question - What is\r\na sunbeam?  We have seen that it is really a succession of tiny\r\nrapid waves, travelling from the sun to us across the invisible\r\nsubstance we call \"ether\", and keeping up a constant cannonade\r\nupon everything which comes in their way.  We have also seen\r\nthat, tiny as these waves are, they can still vary in size, so\r\nthat one single sunbeam is made up of myriads of different-sized\r\nwaves, which travel all together and make us see white light;\r\nunless for some reason they are scattered apart, so that we see\r\nthem separately as red, green, blue, or yellow.  How they are\r\nscattered, and many other secrets of the sun-waves, we cannot\r\nstop to consider not, but must pass on to ask -\r\n\r\nWhat work do the sunbeams do for us?\r\n\r\nThey do two things - they give us light and heat.  It is by means\r\nof them alone that we see anything.  When the room was dark you\r\ncould not distinguish the table, the chairs, or even the walls of\r\nthe room.  Why?  Because they had no light-waves to send to your\r\neye.  But as the sunbeams began to pour in at the window, the\r\nwaves played upon the things in the room, and when they hit them\r\nthey bounded off them back to your eye, as a wave of the sea\r\nbounds back from a rock and strikes against a passing boat.\r\nThen, when they fell upon your eye, they entered it and excited\r\nthe retina and the nerves, and the image of the chair or the\r\ntable was carried to your brain.  Look around at all the things\r\nin this room.  Is it not strange to think that each one of them\r\nis sending these invisible messengers straight to your eye as you\r\nlook at it; and that you see me, and distinguish me from the\r\ntable, entirely by the kind of waves we each send to you?\r\n\r\nSome substances send back hardly any waves of light, but let them\r\nall pass through them, and thus we cannot see them.  A pane of\r\nclear glass, for instance, lets nearly all the light-waves pass\r\nthrough it, and therefore you often cannot see that the glass is\r\nthere, because no light-messengers come back to you from it.\r\nThus people have sometimes walked up against a glass door and\r\nbroken it, not seeing it was there.  Those substances are\r\ntransparent which, for some reason unknown to us, allow the ether\r\nwaves to pass through them without shaking the atoms of which the\r\nsubstance is made.  In clear glass, for example, all the light-\r\nwaves pass through without affecting the substance of the glass;\r\nwhile in a white wall the larger part of the rays are reflected\r\nback to your eye, and those which pass into the wall, by giving\r\nmotion to its atoms lose their own vibrations.\r\n\r\nInto polished shining metal the waves hardly enter at all, but\r\nare thrown back from the surface; and so a steel knife or a\r\nsilver spoon are very bright, and are clearly seen.  Quicksilver\r\nis put at the back of looking-glasses because it reflects so many\r\nwaves.  It not only sends back those which come from the sun, but\r\nthose, too, which come from your face.  So, when you see yourself\r\nin a looking-glass, the sun-waves have first played on your face\r\nand bounded off from it to the looking-glass; then, when they\r\nstrike the looking-glass, they are thrown back again on to the\r\nretina of your eye, and you see your own face by means of the\r\nvery waves you threw off from it an instant before.\r\n\r\nBut the reflected light-waves do more for us than this.  They not\r\nonly make us see things, but they make us see them in different\r\ncolours.  What, you will ask, is this too the work of the\r\nsunbeams?  Certainly; for if the colour we see depends on the\r\nsize of the waves which come back to us, then we must see things\r\ncoloured differently according to the waves they send back.  For\r\ninstance, imagine a sunbeam playing on a leaf: part of its waves\r\nbound straight back from it to our eye and make us see the\r\nsurface of the leaf, but the rest go right into the leaf itself,\r\nand there some of them are used up and kept prisoners.  The red,\r\norange, yellow, blue, and violet waves are all useful to the\r\nleaf, and it does not let them go again.  But it cannot absorb\r\nthe green waves, and so it throws them back, and they travel to\r\nyour eye and make you see a green colour.  So when you say a leaf\r\nis green, you mean that the leaf does not want the green waves of\r\nthe sunbeam, but sends them back to you.  In the same way the\r\nscarlet geranium rejects the red waves; this table sends back\r\nbrown waves; a white tablecloth sends back nearly the whole of\r\nthe waves, and a black coat scarcely any.  This is why, when\r\nthere is very little light in the room, you can see a white\r\ntablecloth while you would not be able to distinguish a black\r\nobject, because the few faint rays that are there, are all sent\r\nback to you from a white surface.\r\n\r\nIs it not curious to think that there is really no such thing as\r\ncolour in the leaf, the table, the coat, or the geranium flower,\r\nbut we see them of different colours because, for some reason,\r\nthey send back only certain coloured waves to our eye?\r\n\r\nWherever you look, then, and whatever you see, all the beautiful\r\ntints, colours, lights, and shades around you are the work of the\r\ntiny sun-waves.\r\n\r\nAgain, light does a great deal of work when it falls upon plants.\r\nThose rays of light which are caught by the leaf are by no means\r\nidle; we shall see in Lecture VII that the leaf uses them to\r\ndigest its food and make the sap on which the plant feeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 6\r\n\r\nWe all know that a plant becomes pale and sickly if it has not\r\nsunlight, and the reason is, that without these light-waves it\r\ncannot get food out of the air, nor make the sap and juices which\r\nit needs.  When you look at plants and trees growing in the\r\nbeautiful meadows; at the fields of corn, and at the lovely\r\nlandscape, you are looking on the work of the tiny waves of\r\nlight, which never rest all through the day in helping to give\r\nlife to every green thing that grows.\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken only of light; but hold your hand in the\r\nsun and feel the heat of the sunbeams, and then consider if the\r\nwaves of heat do not do work also.  There are many waves in a\r\nsunbeam which move too slowly to make us see light when they hit\r\nour eye, but we can feel them as heat, though we cannot see them\r\nas light.  The simplest way of feeling heat-waves is to hold a\r\nwarm iron near your face.  You know that no light comes from it,\r\nyet you can feel the heat-waves beating violently against your\r\nface and scorching it.  Now there are many of these dark heat-\r\nrays in a sunbeam, and it is they which do most of the work in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as they come quivering to the earth, it is\r\nthey which shake the water-drops apart, so that these are carried\r\nup in the air, as we shall see in the next lecture.  And then\r\nremember, it is these drops, falling again as rain, which make\r\nthe rivers and all the moving water on the earth.  So also it is\r\nthe heat-waves which make the air hot and light, and so cause it\r\nto rise and make winds and air-currents, and these again give\r\nrise to ocean-currents.  It is these dark rays, again, which\r\nstrike upon the land and give it the warmth which enables plants\r\nto grow.  It is they also which keep up the warmth in our own\r\nbodies, both by coming to us directly from the sun, and also in a\r\nvery roundabout way through plants.  You will remember that\r\nplants use up rays of light and heat in growing; then either we\r\neat the plants, or animals eat the plants and we eat the animals;\r\nand when we digest the food, that heat comes back in our bodies,\r\nwhich the plants first took from the sunbeam.  Breathe upon your\r\nhand, and feel how hot your breath is; well, that heat which you\r\nfeel, was once in a sunbeam, and has travelled from it through\r\nthe food you have eaten, and has now been at work keeping up the\r\nheat of your body.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another way in which these plants may give out\r\nthe heat-waves they have imprisoned.  You will remember how we\r\nlearnt in the first lecture that coal is made of plants, and that\r\nthe heat they give out is the heat these plants once took in.\r\nThink how much work is done by burning coals.  Not only are our\r\nhouses warmed by coal fires and lighted by coal gas, but our\r\nsteam-engines and machinery work entirely by water which has been\r\nturned into steam by the heat of coal and coke fire; and our\r\nsteamboats travel all over the world by means of the same power.\r\nIn the same way the oil of our lamps comes either from olives,\r\nwhich grow on trees; or from coal and the remains of plants and\r\nanimals in the earth.  Even our tallow candles are made of mutton\r\nfat, and sheep eat grass; as so, turn which way we will, we find\r\nthat the light and heat on our earth, whether it comes from\r\nfires, or candles, or lamps, or gas, and whether it moves\r\nmachinery, or drives a train, or propels a ship, is equally the\r\nwork of the invisible waves of ether coming from the sun, which\r\nmake what we call a sunbeam.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are still some hidden waves which we have not yet\r\nmentioned, which are not useful to us either as light or heat,\r\nand yet they are not idle.\r\n\r\nBefore I began this lecture, I put a piece of paper, which had\r\nbeen dipped in nitrate of silver, under a piece of glass; and\r\nbetween it and the glass I put a piece of lace.  Look what the\r\nsun has been doing while I have been speaking.  It has been\r\nbreaking up the nitrate of silver on the paper and turning it\r\ninto a deep brown substance; only where the threads of the lace\r\nwere, and the sun could not touch the nitrate of silver, there\r\nthe paper has remained light-coloured, and by this means I have a\r\nbeautiful impression of the lace on the paper.  I will now dip\r\nthe impression into water in which some hyposulphite of soda is\r\ndissolved, and this will \"fix\" the picture, that is, prevent the\r\nsun acting upon it any more; then the picture will remain\r\ndistinct, and I can pass it round to you all.  Here, again,\r\ninvisible waves have been at work, and this time neither as light\r\nnor as heat, but as chemical agents, and it is these waves which\r\ngive us all our beautiful photographs.  In any toyshop you can\r\nbuy this prepared paper, and set the chemical waves at work to\r\nmake pictures.  Only you must remember to fix it in the solution\r\nafterwards, otherwise the chemical rays will go on working after\r\nyou have taken the lace away, and all the paper will become brown\r\nand your picture will disappear.\r\n\r\nAnd now, tell me, may we not honestly say, that the invisible\r\nwaves which make our sunbeams, are wonderful fairy messengers as\r\nthey travel eternally and unceasingly across space, never\r\nresting, never tiring in doing the work of our world?  Little as\r\nwe have been able to learn about them in one short hour, do they\r\nnot seem to you worth studying and worth thinking about, as we\r\nlook at the beautiful results of their work?  The ancient Greeks\r\nworshipped the sun, and condemned to death one of their greatest\r\nphilosophers, named Anaxagoras, because he denied that it was a\r\ngod.  We can scarcely wonder at this when we see what the sun\r\ndoes for our world; but we know that it is a huge globe made of\r\ngases and fiery matter and not a god.  We are grateful for the\r\nsun instead of to him, and surely we shall look at him with new\r\ninterest, now that we can picture his tiny messengers, the\r\nsunbeams, flitting over all space, falling upon our earth, giving\r\nus light to see with, and beautiful colours to enjoy, warming the\r\nair and the earth, making the refreshing rain, and, in a word,\r\nfilling the world with life and gladness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 7\r\n\r\nLECTURE III The Aerial Ocean in Which We Live\r\n\r\nDid you ever sit on the bank of a river in some quiet spot where\r\nthe water was deep and clear, and watch the fishes swimming\r\nlazily along?  When I was a child this was one of my favourite\r\noccupations in the summertime on the banks of the Thames, and\r\nthere was one question which often puzzled me greatly, as I\r\nwatched the minnows and gudgeon gliding along through the water.\r\nWhy should fishes live in something and be often buffeted about\r\nby waves and currents, while I and others lived on the top of the\r\nearth and not in anything?  I do not remember ever asking anyone\r\nabout this; and if I had, in those days people did not pay much\r\nattention to children's questions, and probably nobody would have\r\ntold me, what I now tell you, that we do live in something quite\r\nas real and often quite as rough and stormy as the water in which\r\nthe fishes swim.  The something in which we live is air, and the\r\nreason that we do not perceive it, is that we are in it, and that\r\nit is a gas, and invisible to us; while we are above the water in\r\nwhich the fishes live, and it is a liquid which our eyes can\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose for a moment that a being, whose eyes were so\r\nmade that he could see gases as we see liquids, was looking down\r\nfrom a distance upon our earth.  He would see an ocean of air, or\r\naerial ocean, all round the globe, with birds floating about in\r\nit, and people walking along the bottom, just as we see fish\r\ngliding along the bottom of a river.  It is true, he would never\r\nsee even the birds come near to the surface, for the highest-\r\nflying bird, the condor, never soars more than five miles from\r\nthe ground, and our atmosphere, as we shall see, is at least 100\r\nmiles high.  So he would call us all deep-air creatures, just as\r\nwe talk of deep-sea animals; and if we can imagine that he fished\r\nin this air-ocean, and could pull one of us out of it into space,\r\nhe would find that we should gasp and die just as fishes do when\r\npulled out of the water.\r\n\r\nHe would also observe very curious things going on in our air-\r\nocean; he would see large streams and currents of air, which we\r\ncall winds, and which would appear to him as ocean-currents do to\r\nus, while near down to the earth he would see thick mists forming\r\nand then disappearing again, and these would be our clouds.  From\r\nthem he would see rain, hail and snow falling to the earth, and\r\nfrom time to time bright flashes would shoot across the air-\r\nocean, which would be our lightning.  Nay even the brilliant\r\nrainbow, the northern aurora borealis, and the falling stars,\r\nwhich seem to us so high up in space, would be seen by him near\r\nto our earth, and all within the aerial ocean.\r\n\r\nBut as we know of no such being living in space, who can tell us\r\nwhat takes place in our invisible air, and we cannot see it\r\nourselves, we must try by experiments to see it with our\r\nimagination, though we cannot with our eyes.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, can we discover what air is?  At one time it was\r\nthought that it was a simple gas and could not be separated into\r\nmore than one kind.  But we are now going to make an experiment\r\nby which it has been shown that air is made of two gases mingled\r\ntogether, and that one of these gases, called oxygen, is used up\r\nwhen anything burns, while the other nitrogen is not used, and\r\nonly serves to dilute the minute atoms of oxygen.  I have here a\r\nglass bell-jar, with a cork fixed tightly in the neck, and I\r\nplace the jar over a pan of water, while on the water floats a\r\nplate with a small piece of phosphorus upon it.  You will see\r\nthat by putting the bell-jar over the water, I have shut in a\r\ncertain quantity of air, and my object now is to use up the\r\noxygen out of this air and leave only nitrogen behind.  To do\r\nthis I must light the piece of phosphorus, for you will remember\r\nit is in burning that oxygen is used up.  I will take the cork\r\nout, light the phosphorus, and cork up the jar again.  See! as\r\nthe phosphorus burns white fumes fill the jar.  These fumes are\r\nphosphoric acid which is a substance made of phosphorous and the\r\noxygen of the air together.\r\n\r\nNow, phosphoric acid melts in water just as sugar does, and in a\r\nfew minutes these fumes will disappear.  They are beginning to\r\nmelt already, and the water from the pan is rising up in the\r\nbell-jar.  Why is this?  Consider for a moment what we have done.\r\nFirst, the jar was full of air, that is, of mixed oxygen and\r\nnitrogen; then the phosphorus used up the oxygen making white\r\nfumes; afterwards, the water sucked up these fumes; and so, in\r\nthe jar now nitrogen is the only gas left, and the water has\r\nrisen up to fill all the rest of the space that was once taken up\r\nwith oxygen.\r\n\r\nWe can easily prove that there is no oxygen now in the jar.  I\r\ntake out the cork and let a lighted taper down into the gas.  If\r\nthere were any oxygen the taper would burn, but you see it goes\r\nout directly proving that all the oxygen has been used up by the\r\nphosphorous.  When this experiment is made very accurately, we\r\nfind that for every pint of oxygen in air there are four pints of\r\nnitrogen, so that the active oxygen-atoms are scattered about,\r\nfloating in the sleepy, inactive nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is these oxygen-atoms which we use up when we breathe.  If I\r\nhad put a mouse under the bell-jar, instead of the phosphorus,\r\nthe water would have risen just the same, because the mouse would\r\nhave breathed in the oxygen and used it up in its body, joining\r\nit to carbon and making a bad gas, carbonic acid, which would\r\nalso melt in the water, and when all the oxygen was used, the\r\nmouse would have died.\r\n\r\nDo you see now how foolish it is to live in rooms that are\r\nclosely shut up, or to hide your head under the bedclothes when\r\nyou sleep?  You use up all the oxygen-atoms, and then there are\r\nnone left for you to breathe; and besides this, you send out of\r\nyour mouth bad fumes, though you cannot see them, and these, when\r\nyou breathe them in again, poison you and make you ill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will say, If oxygen is so useful, why is not the air\r\nmade entirely of it?  But think for a moment.  If there was such\r\nan immense quantity of oxygen, how fearfully fast everything\r\nwould burn!  Our bodies would soon rise above fever heat from the\r\nquantity of oxygen we should take in, and all fires and lights\r\nwould burn furiously.  In fact, a flame once lighted would spread\r\nso rapidly that no power on earth could stop it, and everything\r\nwould be destroyed.  So the lazy nitrogen is very useful in\r\nkeeping the oxygen-atoms apart; and we have time, even when a\r\nfire is very large and powerful, to put it out before it has\r\ndrawn in more and more oxygen from the surrounding air.  Often,\r\nif you can shut a fire into a closed space, as in a closely-shut\r\nroom or the hold of a ship, it will go out, because it has used\r\nup all the oxygen in the air.\r\n\r\nSo, you see, we shall be right in picturing this invisible air\r\nall around us as a mixture of two gases.  But when we examine\r\nordinary air very carefully, we find small quantities of other\r\ngases in it, besides oxygen and nitrogen.  First, there is\r\ncarbonic acid gas.  This is the bad gas which we give out of our\r\nmouths after we have burnt up the oxygen with the carbon of our\r\nbodies inside our lungs; and this carbonic acid is also given out\r\nfrom everything that burns.  If only animals lived in the world,\r\nthis gas would soon poison the air; but plants get hold of it,\r\nand in the sunshine they break it up again, as we shall see in\r\nLecture VII, and use up the carbon, throwing the oxygen back into\r\nthe air for us to use.  Secondly, there are very small quantities\r\nof ammonia, or the gas which almost chokes you in smelling-salts,\r\nand which, when liquid is commonly called \"spirits of hartshorn.\"\r\nThis ammonia is useful to plants, as we shall see by and by.\r\nLastly, there is a great deal of water in the air, floating about\r\nas invisible vapour or water-dust, and this we shall speak of in\r\nthe next lecture.  Still, all these gases and vapours in the\r\natmosphere are in very small quantities, and the bulk of the air\r\nis composed of oxygen and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nHaving now learned what air is, the next question which presents\r\nitself is, Why does it stay round our earth?  You will remember\r\nwe saw in the first lecture, that all the little atoms of a gas\r\nare trying to fly away from each other, so that if I turn on this\r\ngas-jet the atoms soon leave it, and reach you at the farther end\r\nof the room, and you can smell the gas.  Why, then, do not all\r\nthe atoms of oxygen and nitrogen fly away from our earth into\r\nspace, and leave us without any air?\r\n\r\nAh!  here you must look for another of our invisible forces.\r\nHave you forgotten our giant force, \"gravitation,\" which draws\r\nthings together from a distance?  This force draws together the\r\nearth and the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen; and as the earth is\r\nvery big and heavy, and the atoms of air are light and easily\r\nmoved, they are drawn down to the earth and held there by\r\ngravitation.  But for all that, the atmosphere does not leave off\r\ntrying to fly away; it is always pressing upwards and outwards\r\nwith all its might, while the earth is doing its best to hold it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is, that near the earth, where the pull\r\ndownward is very strong, the air-atoms are drawn very closely\r\ntogether, because gravitation gets the best of the struggle.  But\r\nas we get farther and farther from the earth, the pull downward\r\nbecomes weaker, and then the air-atoms spring farther apart, and\r\nthe air becomes thinner.  Suppose that the lines in this diagram\r\nrepresent layers of air.  Near the earth we have to represent\r\nthem as lying closely together, but as they recede from the earth\r\nthey are also farther apart.\r\n\r\nBut the chief reason why the air is thicker or denser nearer the\r\nearth, is because the upper layers press it down.  If you have a\r\nheap of papers lying one on the top of the other, you know that\r\nthose at the bottom of the heap will be more closely pressed\r\ntogether than those above, and just the same is the case with the\r\natoms of the air.  Only there is this difference, if the papers\r\nhave lain for some time, when you take the top ones off, the\r\nunder ones remain close together.  But it is not so with the air,\r\nbecause air is elastic, and the atoms are always trying to fly\r\napart, so that directly you take away the pressure they spring up\r\nagain as far as they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 8\r\n\r\nI have here an ordinary pop-gun.  If I push the cork in very\r\ntight, and then force the piston slowly inwards, I can compress\r\nthe air a good deal.  Now I am forcing the atoms nearer and\r\nnearer together, but at last they rebel so strongly against being\r\nmore crowded that the cork cannot resist their pressure.  Out it\r\nflies, and the atoms spread themselves out comfortably again in\r\nthe air all around them.  Now, just as I pressed the air together\r\nin the pop-gun, so the atmosphere high up above the earth presses\r\non the air below and keeps the atoms closely packed together.\r\nAnd in this case the atoms cannot force back the air above them\r\nas they did the cork in the pop-gun; they are obliged to submit\r\nto be pressed together.\r\n\r\nEven a short distance from the earth, however, at the top of a\r\nhigh mountain, the air becomes lighter, because it has less\r\nweight of atmosphere above it, and people who go up in balloons\r\noften have great difficulty in breathing, because the air is so\r\nthin and light.  In 1804 a Frenchman, named Gay-Lussac, went up\r\nfour miles and a half in a balloon, and brought down some air;\r\nand he found that it was much less heavy than the same quantity\r\nof air taken close down to the earth, showing that it was much\r\nthinner, or rarer, as it is called;* and when, in 1862, Mr.\r\nGlaisher and Mr. Coxwell went up five miles and a half, Mr.\r\nGlaisher's veins began to swell, and his head grew dizzy, and he\r\nfainted.  The air was too thin for him to breathe enough in at a\r\ntime, and it did not press heavily enough on the drums of his\r\nears and the veins of his body.  He would have died if Mr.\r\nCoxwell had not quickly let off some of the gas in the balloon,\r\nso that it sank down into denser air. (*100 cubic inches near the\r\nearth weighed 31 grains, while the same quantity taken at four\r\nand a half miles up in the air weighed only 12 grains, or two-\r\nfifths of the weight.)\r\n\r\nAnd now comes another very interesting question.  If the air gets\r\nless and less dense as it is farther from the earth, where does\r\nit stop altogether?  We cannot go up to find out, because we\r\nshould die long before we reached the limit; and for a long time\r\nwe had to guess about how high the atmosphere probably was, and\r\nit was generally supposed not to be more than fifty miles.  But\r\nlately, some curious bodies, which we should have never suspected\r\nwould be useful to us in this way, have let us into the secret of\r\nthe height of the atmosphere.  These bodies are the meteors, or\r\nfalling stars.\r\n\r\nMost people, at one time or another, have seen what looks like a\r\nstar shoot right across the sky, and disappear.  On a clear\r\nstarlight night you may often see one or more of these bright\r\nlights flash through the air; for one falls on an average in\r\nevery twenty minutes, and on the nights of August 9th and\r\nNovember 13th there are numbers in one part of the sky.  These\r\nbodies are not really stars; they are simply stones or lumps of\r\nmetal flying through the air, and taking fire by clashing against\r\nthe atoms of oxygen in it.  There are great numbers of these\r\nmasses moving round and round the sun, and when our earth comes\r\nacross their path, as it does especially in August and November,\r\nthey dash with such tremendous force through the atmosphere that\r\nthey grow white-hot, and give out light, and then disappear,\r\nmelted into vapour.  Every now and then one falls to the earth\r\nbefore it is all melted away, and thus we learn that these stones\r\ncontain tin, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, and other substances.\r\n\r\nIt is while these bodies are burning that they look to us like\r\nfalling stars, and when we see them we know that hey must be\r\ndashing against our atmosphere.  Now if two people stand a\r\ncertain known distance, say fifty miles, apart on the earth and\r\nobserve these meteors and the direction in which they each see\r\nthem fall, they can calculate (by means of the angle between the\r\ntwo directions) how high they are above them when they first see\r\nthem, and at that moment they must have struck against the\r\natmosphere, and even travelled some way through it, to become\r\nwhite-hot.  In this way we have learnt that meteors burst into\r\nlight at least 100 miles above the surface of the earth, and so\r\nthe atmosphere must be more than 100 miles high.\r\n\r\nOur next question is as to the weight of our aerial ocean.  You\r\nwill easily understand that all this air weighing down upon the\r\nearth must be very heavy, even though it grows lighter as it\r\nascends.  The atmosphere does, in fact, weigh down upon land at\r\nthe level of the sea as much as if a 15-pound weight were put\r\nupon every square inch of land.  This little piece of linen\r\npaper, which I am holding up, measures exactly a square inch, and\r\nas it lies on the table, it is bearing a weight of 15 lbs. on its\r\nsurface.  But how, then, comes it that I can lift it so easily?\r\nWhy am I not conscious of the weight?\r\n\r\nTo understand this you must give all your attention, for it is\r\nimportant and at first not very easy to grasp.  you must\r\nremember, in the first place, that the air is heavy because it is\r\nattracted to the earth, and in the second place, that since air\r\nis elastic all the atoms of it are pushing upwards against this\r\ngravitation.  And so, at any point in air, as for instance the\r\nplace where the paper now is as I hold it up, I feel no pressure\r\nbecause exactly as much as gravitation is pulling the air down,\r\nso much elasticity is resisting and pushing it up.  So the\r\npressure is equal upwards, downwards, and on all sides, and I can\r\nmove the paper with equal ease any way.\r\n\r\nEven if I lay the paper on the table this is still true, because\r\nthere is always some air under it.  If, however, I could get the\r\nair quite away from one side of the paper, then the pressure on\r\nthe other side would show itself.  I can do this by simply\r\nwetting the paper and letting it fall on the table, and the water\r\nwill prevent any air from getting under it.  Now see! if I try to\r\nlift it by the thread in the middle, I have great difficulty,\r\nbecause the whole 15 pounds' weight of the atmosphere is pressing\r\nit down.  A still better way of making the experiment is with a\r\npiece of leather, such as the boys often amuse themselves with in\r\nthe streets.  This piece of leather has been well soaked.  I drop\r\nit on the floor and see! it requires all my strength to pull it\r\nup.  (In fastening the string to the leather the hole must be\r\nvery small and the know as flat as possible, and it is even well\r\nto put a small piece of kid under the knot.  When I first made\r\nthis experiment, not having taken these precautions, it did not\r\nsucceed well, owing to air getting in through the hole.)  I now\r\ndrop it on this stone weight, and so heavily is it pressed down\r\nupon it by the atmosphere that I can lift the weight without its\r\nbreaking away from it.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried to pick limpets off a rock?  If so, you know\r\nhow tight they cling.  the limpet clings to the rock just in the\r\nsame way as this leather does to the stone; the little animal\r\nexhausts the air inside it's shell, and then it is pressed\r\nagainst the rock by the whole weight of the air above.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will wonder how it is that if we have a weight of 15\r\nlbs. pressing on every square inch of our bodies, it does not\r\ncrush us.  And, indeed, it amounts on the whole to a weight of\r\nabout 15 tons upon the body of a grown man.  It would crush us if\r\nit were not that there are gases and fluids inside our bodies\r\nwhich press outwards and balance the weight so that we do not\r\nfeel it at all.\r\n\r\nThis is why Mr. Glaisher's veins swelled and he grew giddy in\r\nthin air.  The gases and fluids inside his body were pressing\r\noutwards as much as when he was below, but the air outside did\r\nnot press so heavily, and so all the natural condition of his\r\nbody was disturbed.\r\n\r\nI hope we now realize how heavily the air presses down upon our\r\nearth, but it is equally necessary to understand how, being\r\nelastic, it also presses upwards; and we can prove this by a\r\nsimple experiment.  I fill this tumbler with water, and keeping a\r\npiece of card firmly pressed against it, I turn the whole upside-\r\ndown.  When I now take my hand away you would naturally expect\r\nthe card to fall, and the water to be spilt.  But no! the card\r\nremains as if glued to the tumbler, kept there entirely by the\r\nair pressing upwards against it.  (The engraver has drawn the\r\ntumbler only half full of water.  The experiment will succeed\r\nquite as well in this way if the tumbler be turned over quickly,\r\nso that part of the air escapes between the tumbler and the card,\r\nand therefore the space above the water is occupied by air less\r\ndense than that outside.)\r\n\r\nAnd now we are almost prepared to understand how we can weigh the\r\ninvisible air.  One more experiment first.  I have here what is\r\ncalled a U tube, because it is shaped like a large U.  I pour\r\nsome water in it till it is about half full, and you will notice\r\nthat the water stands at the same height in both arms of the\r\ntube, because the air presses on both surfaces alike.  Putting my\r\nthumb on one end I tilt the tube carefully, so as to make the\r\nwater run up to the end of one arm, and then turn it back again.\r\nBut the water does not now return to its even position, it\r\nremains up in the arm on which my thumb rests.  Why is this?\r\nBecause my thumb keeps back the air from pressing at that end,\r\nand the whole weight of the atmosphere rests on the water at the\r\nother end.  And so we learn that not only has the atmosphere real\r\nweight, but we can see the effects of this weight by making it\r\nbalance a column of water or any other liquid.  In the case of\r\nthe wetted leather we felt the weight of the air, here we see its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nNow when we wish to see the weight of the air we consult a\r\nbarometer, which works really just in the same way as the water\r\nin this tube.  An ordinary upright barometer is simply a straight\r\ntube of glass filled with mercury or quicksilver, and turned\r\nupside-down in a small cup of mercury.  The tube is a little more\r\nthan 30 inches long, and though it is quite full of mercury\r\nbefore it is turned up, yet directly it stands in the cup the\r\nmercury falls, till there is a height of about 30 inches between\r\nthe surface of the mercury in the cup, and that of the mercury in\r\nthe tube.  As it falls it leaves an empty space above the mercury\r\nwhich is called a vacuum, because it has no air in it.  Now, the\r\nmercury is under the same conditions as the water was in the U\r\ntube, there is no pressure upon it at the top of the tube, while\r\nthere is a pressure of 15 lbs. upon it in the bowl, and therefore\r\nit remains held up in the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 9\r\n\r\nBut why will it not remain more than 30 inches high in the tube?\r\nYou must remember it is only kept up in the tube at all by the\r\nair which presses on the mercury in the cup.  And that column of\r\nmercury now balances the pressure of the air outside, and presses\r\ndown on the mercury in the cup at its mouth just as much as the\r\nair does on the rest.  So this cup and tube act exactly like a\r\npair of scales.  The air outside is the thing to be weighed at\r\none end as it presses on the mercury, the column answers to the\r\nleaden weight at the other end which tells you how heavy the air\r\nis.  Now if the bore of this tube is made an inch square, then\r\nthe 30 inches of mercury in it weigh exactly 15 lbs, and so we\r\nknow that the weight of the air is 15 lbs. upon every square\r\ninch, but if the bore of the tube is only half a square inch, and\r\ntherefore the 30 inches of mercury only weigh 7 1/2 lbs. instead\r\nof 15 lbs., the pressure of the atmosphere will also be halved,\r\nbecause it will only act upon half a square inch of surface, and\r\nfor this reason it will make no difference to the height of the\r\nmercury whether the tube be broad or narrow.\r\n\r\nBut now suppose the atmosphere grows lighter, as it does when it\r\nhas much damp in it.  The barometer will show this at once,\r\nbecause there will be less weight on the mercury in the cup,\r\ntherefore it will not keep the mercury pushed so high up in the\r\ntube.  In other words, the mercury in the tube will fall.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that one day the air is so much lighter that it\r\npresses down only with a weight of 14 1/2 lbs. to the square inch\r\ninstead of 15 lbs.  Then the mercury would fall to 29 inches,\r\nbecause each inch is equal to the weight of half a pound.  Now,\r\nwhen the air is damp and very full of water-vapour it is much\r\nlighter, and so when the barometer falls we expect rain.\r\nSometimes, however, other causes make the air light, and then,\r\nalthough the barometer is low, no rain comes,\r\n\r\nAgain, if the air becomes heavier the mercury is pushed up above\r\n30 to 31 inches, and in this way we are able to weigh the\r\ninvisible air-ocean all over the world, and tell when it grows\r\nlighter or heavier.  This then, is the secret of the barometer.\r\nWe cannot speak of the thermometer today, but I should like to\r\nwarn you in passing that it has nothing to do with the weight of\r\nthe air, but only with heat, and acts in quite a different way.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have been so long hunting out, testing and weighing\r\nour aerial ocean, that scarcely any time is left us to speak of\r\nits movements or the pleasant breezes which it makes for us in\r\nour country walks.  Did you ever try to run races on a very windy\r\nday?  Ah! then you feel the air strongly enough; how it beats\r\nagainst your face and chest, and blows down your throat so as to\r\ntake your breath away; and what hard work it is to struggle\r\nagainst it!  Stop for a moment and rest, and ask yourself, what\r\nis the wind?  Why does it blow sometimes one way and sometimes\r\nanother, and sometimes not at all?\r\n\r\nWind is nothing more than air moving across the surface of the\r\nearth, which as it passes along bends the tops of the trees,\r\nbeats against the houses, pushes the ships along by their sails,\r\nturns the windmill, carries off the smoke from cities, whistles\r\nthrough the keyhole, and moans as it rushes down the valley.\r\nWhat makes the air restless? why should it not lie still all\r\nround the earth?\r\n\r\nIt is restless because, as you will remember, its atoms are kept\r\npressed together near the earth by the weight of the air above,\r\nand they take every opportunity, when they can find more room, to\r\nspread out violently and rush into the vacant space, and this\r\nrush we call a wind.\r\n\r\nImagine a great number of active schoolboys all crowded into a\r\nroom till they can scarcely move their arms and legs for the\r\ncrush, and then suppose all at once a large door is opened.  Will\r\nthey not all come tumbling out pell-mell, one over the other,\r\ninto the hall beyond, so that if you stood in their way you would\r\nmost likely be knocked down?  Well, just this happens to the air-\r\natoms; when they find a space before them into which they can\r\nrush, they come on helter-skelter, with such force that you have\r\ngreat difficulty in standing against them, and catch hold of\r\nsomething to support you for fear you should be blown down.\r\n\r\nBut how come they to find any empty space to receive them?  To\r\nanswer this we must go back again to our little active invisible\r\nfairies the sunbeams.  When the sun-waves come pouring down upon\r\nthe earth they pass through the air almost without heating it.\r\nBut not so with the ground; there they pass down only a short\r\ndistance and then are thrown back again.  And when these sun-\r\nwaves come quivering back they force the atoms of the air near\r\nthe earth apart and make it lighter; so that the air close to the\r\nsurface of the heated ground becomes less heavy than the air\r\nabove it, and rises just as a cork rises in water.  You know that\r\nhot air rises in the chimney; for if you put a piece of lighted\r\npaper on the fire it is carried up by the draught of air, often\r\neven before it can ignite.  Now just as the hot air rises from\r\nthe fire, so it rises from the heated ground up into higher parts\r\nof the atmosphere.  and as it rises it leaves only thin air\r\nbehind it, and this cannot resist the strong cold air whose atoms\r\nare struggling and trying to get free, and they rush in and fill\r\nthe space.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest examples of wind is to be found at the\r\nseaside.  there in the daytime the land gets hot under the\r\nsunshine, and heats the air, making it grow light and rise.\r\nMeanwhile the sunshine on the water goes down deeper, and so does\r\nnot send back so many heat-waves into the air; consequently the\r\nair on the top of the water is cooler and heavier, and it rushes\r\nin from over the sea to fill up the space on the shore left by\r\nthe warm air as it rises.  This is why the seaside is so pleasant\r\nin hot weather.  During the daytime a light sea-breeze nearly\r\nalways sets in from the sea to the land.\r\n\r\nWhen night comes, however, then the land loses its heat very\r\nquickly, because it has not stored it up and the land-air grows\r\ncold; but the sea, which has been hoarding the sun-waves down in\r\nits depths, now gives them up to the atmosphere above it, and the\r\nsea-air becomes warm and rises.  For this reason it is now the\r\nturn of the cold air from the land to spread over the sea, and\r\nyou have a land-breeze blowing off the shore.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reason why there are such steady winds, called the\r\ntrade winds, blowing towards the equator, is that the sun is very\r\nhot at the equator, and hot air is always rising there and making\r\nroom for colder air to rush in.  We have not time to travel\r\nfarther with the moving air, though its journeys are extremely\r\ninteresting; but if, when you read about the trade and other\r\nwinds, you will always picture to yourselves warm air made light\r\nby the heat rising up into space and cold air expanding and\r\nrushing in to fill its place, I can promise you that you will not\r\nfind the study of aerial currents so dry as many people imagine\r\nit to be.\r\n\r\nWe are now able to form some picture of our aerial ocean.  We can\r\nimagine the active atoms of oxygen floating in the sluggish\r\nnitrogen, and being used up in every candle-flame, gas-jet and\r\nfire, and in the breath of all living beings; and coming out\r\nagain tied fast to atoms of carbon and making carbonic acid.\r\nThen we can turn to trees and plants, and see them tearing these\r\ntwo apart again, holding the carbon fast and sending the\r\ninvisible atoms of oxygen bounding back again into the air, ready\r\nto recommence work.  We can picture all these air-atoms, whether\r\nof oxygen or nitrogen, packed close together on the surface of\r\nthe earth, and lying gradually farther and farther apart, as they\r\nhave less weight above them, till they become so scattered that\r\nwe can only detect them as they rub against the flying meteors\r\nwhich flash into light.  We can feel this great weight of air\r\npressing the limpet on to the rock; and we can see it pressing up\r\nthe mercury in the barometer and so enabling us to measure its\r\nweight.  Lastly, every breath of wind that blows past us tells us\r\nhow this aerial ocean is always moving to and fro on the face of\r\nthe earth; and if we think for a moment how much bad air and bad\r\nmatter it must carry away, as it goes from crowded cities to be\r\npurified in the country, we can see how, in even this one way\r\nalone, it is a great blessing to us.\r\n\r\nYet even now we have not mentioned many of the beauties of our\r\natmosphere.  It is the tiny particles floating in the air which\r\nscatter the light of the sun so that it spreads over the whole\r\ncountry and into shady places.  The sun's rays always travel\r\nstraight forward; and in the moon, where there is no atmosphere,\r\nthere is no light anywhere except just where the rays fall.  But\r\non our earth the sun-waves hit against the myriads of particles\r\nin the air and glide off them into the corners of the room or the\r\nrecesses of a shady lane, and so we have light spread before us\r\nwherever we walk in the daytime, instead of those deep black\r\nshadows which we can see through a telescope on the face of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is electricity playing in the air-atoms which gives us\r\nthe beautiful lightning and the grand aurora borealis, and even\r\nthe twinkling of the starts is produced entirely by minute\r\nchanges in the air.  If it were not for our aerial ocean, the\r\nstars would stare at us sternly, instead of smiling with the\r\npleasant twinkle-twinkle which we have all learned to love as\r\nlittle children.\r\n\r\nAll these questions, however, we must leave for the present; only\r\nI hope you will be eager to read about them wherever you can, and\r\nopen your eyes to learn their secrets.  For the present we must\r\nbe content if we can even picture this wonderful ocean of gas\r\nspread round our earth, and some of the work it does for us.\r\n\r\nWe said in the last lecture that without the sunbeams the earth\r\nwould be cold, dark, and frost-ridden.  With sunbeams, but\r\nwithout air, it would indeed have burning heat, side by side with\r\ndarkness and ice, but it could have no soft light.  our planet\r\nmight look beautiful to others, as the moon does to us, but it\r\ncould have comparatively few beauties of its own.  With the\r\nsunbeams and the air, we see it has much to make it beautiful.\r\nBut a third worker is wanted before our planet can revel in\r\nactivity and life.  This worker is water; and in the next lecture\r\nwe shall learn something of the beauty and the usefulness of the\r\n\"drops of water\" on their travels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 10\r\n\r\nLECTURE IV. A DROP OF WATER ON ITS TRAVELS\r\n\r\nWe are going to spend an hour to-day in following a drop of water\r\non its travels. If I dip my finger in this basin of water and\r\nlift it up again, I bring with it a small glistening\r\ndrop out of the body of water below, and hold it before you. Tell\r\nme, have you any idea where this drop has been? what changes it\r\nhas undergone, and what work it has been doing during all the\r\nlong ages that water has lain on the face of the earth? It is a\r\ndrop now, but it was not so before I lifted it out of the basin;\r\nthen it was part of a sheet of water, and will be so again if I\r\nlet it fall. Again, if I were to put this basin on the stove till\r\nall the water had boiled away, where would my drop be then? Where\r\nwould it go? What forms will it take before it reappears in the\r\nrain-cloud, the river, or the sparkling dew?\r\n\r\nThese are questions we are going to try to answer to-day; and\r\nfirst, before we can in the least understand how water travels,\r\nwe must call to mind what we have learnt about the sunbeams and\r\nthe air. We must have clearly pictured in our imagination those\r\ncountless sun-waves which are for ever crossing space, and\r\nespecially those larger and slower undulations, the dark heat-\r\nwaves; for it is these, you will remember, which force the air-\r\natoms apart and make the air light, and it is also these which\r\nare most busy in sending water on its travels. But not these\r\nalone. The sun-waves might shake the water-drops as much as they\r\nliked and turn them into invisible vapour, but they could not\r\ncarry them over the earth if it were not for the winds and\r\ncurrents of that aerial ocean which bears the vapour on its\r\nbosom, and wafts it to different regions of the world.\r\n\r\nLet us try to understand how these two invisible workers, the\r\nsun-waves and the air, deal with the drops of water. I\r\nhave here a kettle (Fig. 18, p. 76) boiling over a spirit-lamp,\r\nand I want you to follow minutely what is going on in it. First,\r\nin the flame of the lamp, atoms of the spirit drawn up from below\r\nare clashing with the oxygen-atoms in the air. This, as you know,\r\ncauses heat-waves and light-waves to move rapidly all round the\r\nlamp. The light-waves cannot pass through the kettle, but the\r\nheat-waves can, and as they enter the water inside they agitate\r\nit violently. Quicker, and still more quickly, the particles of\r\nwater near the bottom of the kettle move to and fro and are\r\nshaken apart; and as they become light they rise through the\r\ncolder water letting another layer come down to be heated in its\r\nturn. The motion grows more and more violent, making the water\r\nhotter and hotter, till at last the particles of which it is\r\ncomposed fly asunder, and escape as invisible vapour. If this\r\nkettle were transparent you would not see any steam above the\r\nwater, because it is in the form of an invisible gas. But as the\r\nsteam comes out of the mouth of the kettle you see a cloud. Why\r\nis this? Because the vapour is chilled by coming out into the\r\ncold air, and its particles are drawn together again into tiny,\r\ntiny drops of water, to which Dr. Tyndall has given the\r\nsuggestive name of water-dust. If you hold a plate over the steam\r\nyou can catch these tiny drops, though they will run into one\r\nanother almost as you are catching them.\r\n\r\nThe clouds you see floating in the sky are made of exactly the\r\nsame kind of water-dust as the cloud from the kettle, and I wish\r\nto show you that this is also really the same as the invisible\r\nsteam within the kettle. I will do so by an experiment\r\nsuggested by Dr. Tyndall. Here is another spirit-lamp, which I\r\nwill hold under the cloud of steam - see! the cloud disappears!\r\nAs soon as the water-dust is heated the heat-waves scatter it\r\nagain into invisible particles, which float away into the room.\r\nEven without the spirit-lamp, you can convince yourself that\r\nwater-vapour may be invisible; for close to the mouth of the\r\nkettle you will see a short blank space before the cloud begins.\r\nIn this space there must be steam, but it is still so hot that\r\nyou cannot see it; and this proves that heat-waves can so shake\r\nwater apart as to carry it away invisibly right before your eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, although we never see any water travelling from our earth up\r\ninto the skies, we know that it goes there, for it comes down\r\nagain in rain, and so it must go up invisibly. But where does the\r\nheat come from which makes this water invisible? Not from below,\r\nas in the case of the kettle, but from above, pouring down from\r\nthe sun. Wherever the sun-waves touch the rivers, ponds, lakes,\r\nseas, or fields of ice and snow upon our earth, they\r\ncarry off invisible water-vapour. They dart down through the top\r\nlayers of the water, and shake the water-particles forcibly\r\napart; and in this case the drops fly asunder more easily and\r\nbefore they are so hot, because they are not kept down by a great\r\nweight of water above, as in the kettle, but find plenty of room\r\nto spread themselves out in the gaps between the air-atoms of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine these water-particles, just above any pond or\r\nlake, rising up and getting entangled among the air-atoms? They\r\nare very light, much lighter than the atmosphere; and so, when a\r\ngreat many of them are spread about in the air which lies just\r\nover the pond, they make it much lighter than the layer of air\r\nabove, and so help it to rise, while the heavier layer of air\r\ncomes down ready to take up more vapour.\r\n\r\nIn this way the sun-waves and the air carry off water everyday,\r\nand all day long, from the top of lakes, rivers, pools, springs,\r\nand seas, and even from the surface of ice and snow. Without any\r\nfuss or noise or sign of any kind, the water of our earth is\r\nbeing drawn up invisibly into the sky.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that in the Indian Ocean three-quarters of\r\nan inch of water is carried off from the surface of the sea in\r\none day and night; so that as much as 22 feet, or a depth of\r\nwater about twice the height of an ordinary room, is silently and\r\ninvisibly lifted up from the whole surface of the ocean in one\r\nyear. It is true this is one of the hottest parts of the earth,\r\nwhere the sun-waves are most active; but even in our\r\nown country many feet of water are drawn up in the summer-time.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, becomes of all this water? Let us follow it as it\r\nstruggles upwards to the sky. We see it in our imagination first\r\ncarrying layer after layer of air up with it from the sea till it\r\nrises far above our heads and above the highest mountains. But\r\nnow, call to mind what happens to the air as it recedes from the\r\nearth. Do you not remember that the air-atoms are always trying\r\nto fly apart, and are only kept pressed together by the weight of\r\nair above them? Well, so this water-laden air rises up, its\r\nparticles, no longer so much pressed together, begin to separate,\r\nand as all work requires an expenditure of heat, the air becomes\r\ncolder, and then you know at once what must happen to the\r\ninvisible vapour, -- it will form into tiny water-drops, like the\r\nsteam from the kettle. And so, as the air rises and becomes\r\ncolder, the vapour gathers into the visible masses, and we can\r\nsee it hanging in the sky, and call it clouds. When these clouds\r\nare highest they are about ten miles from the earth, but when\r\nthey are made of heavy drops and hang low down, they sometimes\r\ncome within a mile of the ground.\r\n\r\nLook up at the clouds as you go home, and think that the water of\r\nwhich they are made has all been drawn up invisibly through the\r\nair. Not, however, necessarily here in London, for we have\r\nalready seen that air travels as wind all over the world, rushing\r\nin to fill spaces made by rising air wherever they occur, and so\r\nthese clouds may be made of vapour collected in the\r\nMediterranean, or in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of America,\r\nor even, if the wind is from the north, of chilly\r\nparticles gathered from the surface of Greenland ice and snow,\r\nand brought here by the moving currents of air. Only, of one\r\nthing we may be sure, that they come from the water of our earth.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if the air is warm, these water-particles may travel a\r\nlong way without ever forming into clouds; and on a hot,\r\ncloudless day the air is often very full of invisible vapour.\r\nThen, if a cold wind comes sweeping along, high up in the sky,\r\nand chills this vapour, it forms into great bodies of water-dust\r\nclouds, and the sky is overcast. At other times clouds hang\r\nlazily in a bright sky, and these show us that just where they\r\nare (as in Fig. 19) the air is cold and turns the invisible\r\nvapour rising from the ground into visible water-dust, so that\r\nexactly in those spaces we see it as clouds. Such clouds form\r\noften on warm, still summer's day, and they are shaped like\r\nmasses of wool, ending in a straight line below. They are not\r\nmerely hanging in the sky, they are really resting upon a tall\r\ncolumn of invisible vapour which stretches right up from the\r\nearth; and that straight line under the clouds marks\r\nthe place where the air becomes cold enough to turn this\r\ninvisible vapour into visible drops of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 11\r\n\r\nAnd now, suppose that while these or any other kind of clouds are\r\noverhead, there comes along either a very cold wind, or a wind\r\nfull of vapour. As it passes through the clouds, it makes them\r\nvery full of water, for, if it chills them, it makes the water-\r\ndust draw more closely together; or, if it brings a new load of\r\nwater-dust, the air is fuller than it can hold. In either case a\r\nnumber of water-particles are set free, and our fairy force\r\n\"cohesion\" seizes upon them at once and forms them into large\r\nwater-drops. Then they are much heavier than the air, and so they\r\ncan float no longer, but down they come to the earth in a shower\r\nof rain.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways in which the air may be chilled, and rain\r\nmade to fall, as, for example, when a wind laden with moisture\r\nstrikes against the cold tops of mountains. Thus the Khasia Hills\r\nin India which face the Bay of Bengal, chill the air which\r\ncrosses them on its way from the Indian Ocean. The wet winds are\r\ndriven up the sides of the hills, the air expands, and the vapour\r\nis chilled, and forming into drops, falls in torrents of rain.\r\nSir J. Hooker tells us that as much as 500 inches of rain fell in\r\nthese hills in nine months. That is to say, if you could measure\r\noff all the ground over which the rain fell, and spread the whole\r\nnine months' rain over it, it would make a lake 500 inches, or\r\nmore than 40 feet deep! You will not be surprised that the\r\ncountry on the other side of these hills gets hardly any rain,\r\nfor all the water has been taken out of the air before\r\nit comes there. Again for example in England, the wind comes to\r\nCumberland and Westmorland over the Atlantic, full of vapour, and\r\nas it strikes against the Pennine Hills it shakes off its watery\r\nload; so that the lake district is the most rainy in England,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of Wales, where the high mountains\r\nhave the same effect.\r\n\r\nIn this way, from different causes, the water of which the sun\r\nhas robbed our rivers and seas, comes back to us, after it has\r\ntravelled to various parts of the world, floating on the bosom of\r\nthe air. But it does not always fall straight back into the\r\nrivers and seas again, a large part of it falls on the land, and\r\nhas to trickle down slopes and into the earth, in order to get\r\nback to its natural home, and it is often caught on its way\r\nbefore it can reach the great waters.\r\n\r\nGo to any piece of ground which is left wild and untouched you\r\nwill find it covered with grass weeds, and other plants; if you\r\ndig up a small plot you will find innumerable tiny roots creeping\r\nthrough the ground in every direction. Each of these roots has a\r\nsponge-like mouth by which the plant takes up water. Now, imagine\r\nrain-drops falling on this plot of ground and sinking into the\r\nearth. On every side they will find rootlets thirsting to drink\r\nthem in, and they will be sucked up as if by tiny sponges, and\r\ndrawn into the plants, and up the stems to the leaves. Here, as\r\nwe shall see in Lecture VII., they are worked up into food for\r\nthe plant, and only if the leaf has more water than it needs,\r\nsome drops may escape at the tiny openings under the\r\nleaf, and be drawn up again by the sun-waves as invisible vapour\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nAgain, much of the rain falls on hard rock and stone, where it\r\ncannot sink in, and then it lies in pools till it is shaken apart\r\nagain into vapour and carried off in the air. Nor is it idle\r\nhere, even before it is carried up to make clouds. We have to\r\nthank this invisible vapour in the air for protecting us from the\r\nburning heat of the sun by day and intolerable frost by night.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment imagine that we can see all that we know\r\nexists between us and the sun. First, we have the fine ether\r\nacross which the sunbeams travel, beating down upon our earth\r\nwith immense force, so that in the sandy desert they are like a\r\nburning fire. Then we have the coarser atmosphere of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen atoms hanging in this ether, and bending the minute sun-\r\nwaves out of their direct path. But they do very little to hinder\r\nthem on their way, and this is why in very dry countries the\r\nsun's heat is so intense. The rays beat down mercilessly, and\r\nnothing opposes them. Lastly, in damp countries we have the\r\nlarger but still invisible particles of vapour hanging about\r\namong the air-atoms. Now, these watery particles, although they\r\nare very few (only about one twenty-fifth part of the whole\r\natmosphere), do hinder the sun-waves. For they are very greedy of\r\nheat, and though the light-waves pass easily through them, they\r\ncatch the heat-waves and use them to help themselves to expand.\r\nAnd so, when there is invisible vapour in the air, the sunbeams\r\ncome to us deprived of some of their heat-waves, and we\r\ncan remain in the sunshine without suffering from the heat.\r\n\r\nThis is how the water-vapour shields us by day, but by night it\r\nis still more useful. During the day our earth and the air near\r\nit have been storing up the heat which has been poured down on\r\nthem, and at night, when the sun goes down, all this heat begins\r\nto escape again. Now, if there were no vapour in the air, this\r\nheat would rush back into space so rapidly that the ground would\r\nbecome cold and frozen even on a summer's night, and all but the\r\nmost hardy plants would die. But the vapour which formed a veil\r\nagainst the sun in the day, now forms a still more powerful veil\r\nagainst the escape of the heat by night. It shuts in the heat-\r\nwaves, and only allows them to make their way slowly upwards from\r\nthe earth - thus producing for us the soft, balmy nights of\r\nsummer and preventing all life being destroyed in the winter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would scarcely imagine at first that it is this screen\r\nof vapour which determines whether or not we shall have dew upon\r\nthe ground. Have you ever thought why dew forms, or what power has\r\nbeen at work scattering the sparkling drops upon the grass?\r\nPicture to yourself that it has been a very hot summer's day, and\r\nthe ground and the grass have been well warmed, and that the sun\r\ngoes down in a clear sky without any clouds. At once the heat-\r\nwaves which have been stored up in the ground, bound back into the\r\nair, and here some are greedily absorbed by the vapour, while\r\nothers make their way slowly upwards. The grass, especially, gives\r\nout these heat-waves very quickly, because the blades, being very\r\nthin, are almost all surface. In consequence of this they part\r\nwith their heat more quickly than they can draw it up from the\r\nground, and become cold. Now the air lying just above the grass is\r\nfull of invisible vapour, and the cold of the blades, as it\r\ntouches them, chills the water- particles, and they are no longer\r\nable to hold apart, but are drawn together into drops on the\r\nsurface of the leaves.\r\n\r\nWe can easily make artificial dew for ourselves. I have here a\r\nbottle of ice which has been kept outside the window. When I\r\nbring it into the warm room a mist forms rapidly outside the\r\nbottle. This mist is composed of water-drops, drawn out of the\r\nair of the room, because the cold glass chilled the air all round\r\nit, so that it gave up its invisible water to form dew-drops.\r\nJust in this same way the cold blades of grass chill the air\r\nlying above them, and steal its vapour.\r\n\r\nBut try the experiment, some night when a heavy dew is expected,\r\nof spreading a thin piece of muslin over some part of the grass,\r\nsupporting it at the four corners with pieces of stick so that it\r\nforms an awning. Though there may be plenty of dew on the grass\r\nall round, yet under this awning you will find scarcely any. The\r\nreason of this is that the muslin checks the heat-waves as they\r\nrise from the grass, and so the grass-blades are not chilled\r\nenough to draw together the water-drops on their surface. If you\r\nwalk out early in the summer mornings and look at the fine cobwebs\r\nflung across the hedges, you will see plenty of drops on the\r\ncobwebs themselves sparkling like diamonds; but underneath on the\r\nleaves there will be none, for even the delicate cobweb has been\r\nstrong enough to shut in the heat-waves and keep the leaves warm.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you walk off the grass on to the gravel path, you find\r\nno dew there. Why is this? Because the stones of the gravel can\r\ndraw up heat from the earth below as fast as they give it out,\r\nand so they are never cold enough to chill the air which touches\r\nthem. On a cloudy night also you will often find little or no dew\r\neven on the grass. The reason of this is that the clouds give\r\nback heat to the earth, and so the grass does not become chilled\r\nenough to draw the water-drops together on its surface. But after\r\na hot, dry day, when the plants are thirsty and there is little\r\nhope of rain to refresh them, then they are able in the evening\r\nto draw the little drops from the air and drink them in before\r\nthe rising sun comes again to carry them away.\r\n\r\nBut our rain-drop undergoes other changes more strange than\r\nthese. Till now we have been imagining it to travel only where\r\nthe temperature is moderate enough for it to remain in a liquid\r\nstate as water. But suppose that when it is drawn up into the air\r\nit meets with such a cold blast as to bring it to the freezing\r\npoint. If it falls into this blast when it is already a drop,\r\nthen it will freeze into a hailstone, and often on a hot summer's\r\nday we may have a severe hailstorm, because the rain-drops have\r\ncrossed a bitterly cold wind as they were falling, and have been\r\nfrozen into round drops of ice.\r\n\r\nBut if the water-vapour reaches the freezing air while it is still\r\nan invisible gas, and before it has been drawn into a drop, then\r\nits history is very different. The ordinary force of cohesion has\r\nthen no power over the particles to make them into watery globes,\r\nbut its place is taken by the fairy process of \"crystallization,\"\r\nand they are formed into beautiful white flakes, to fall in a\r\nsnow-shower. I want you to picture this process to yourselves, for\r\nif once you can take an interest in the wonderful power of nature\r\nto build up crystals, you will be astonished how often you will\r\nmeet with instances of it, and what pleasure it will add to your\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe particles of nearly all substances, when left free and not\r\nhurried, can build themselves into crystal forms. If you melt\r\nsalt in water and then let all the water evaporate slowly, you\r\nwill get salt-crystals;  -- beautiful cubes of transparent salt\r\nall built on the same pattern. The same is true of sugar; and if\r\nyou will look at the spikes of an ordinary stick of sugar-candy,\r\nsuch as I have here, you will see the kind of crystals which\r\nsugar forms. You may even pick out such shapes as these\r\nfrom the common crystallized brown sugar in the sugar basin, or\r\nsee them with a magnifying glass on a lump of white sugar.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only easily melted substances such as sugar and\r\nsalt which form crystals. The beautiful stalactite grottos are\r\nall made of crystals of lime. Diamonds are crystals of carbon,\r\nmade inside the earth. Rock-crystals, which you know probably\r\nunder the name of Irish diamonds, are crystallized quartz; and\r\nso, with slightly different colourings, are agates, opals,\r\njasper, onyx, cairngorms, and many other precious stones. Iron,\r\ncopper, gold, and sulphur, when melted and cooled slowly build\r\nthemselves into crystals, each of their own peculiar form, and we\r\nsee that there is here a wonderful order, such as we should never\r\nhave dreamt of, if we had not proved it. If you possess a\r\nmicroscope you may watch the growth of crystals yourself by\r\nmelting some common powdered nitre in a little water till you\r\nfind that no more will melt in it. Then put a few drops of this\r\nwater on a warm glass slide and place it under the microscope. As\r\nthe drops dry you will see the long transparent needles of nitre\r\nforming on the glass, and notice how regularly these crystals\r\ngrow, not by taking food inside like living beings, but by adding\r\nparticle to particle on the outside evenly and regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 12\r\n\r\nCan we form any idea why the crystals build themselves up so\r\nsystematically? Dr. Tyndall says we can, and I hope by the help\r\nof these small bar magnets to show you how he explains it. These\r\nlittle pieces of steel, which I hope you can see lying\r\non this white cardboard, have been rubbed along a magnet until\r\nthey have become magnets themselves, and I can attract and lift\r\nup a needle with any one of them. But if I try to lift one bar\r\nwith another, I can only do it by bringing certain ends together.\r\nI have tied a piece of red cotton (c, Fig. 21) round one end of\r\neach of the magnets, and if I bring two red ends together they\r\nwill not cling together but roll apart. If, on the contrary, I\r\nput a red end against an end where there is not cotton, then the\r\ntwo bars cling together. This is because every magnet has two\r\npoles or points which are exactly opposite in character, and to\r\ndistinguish them one is called the positive pole and the other\r\nthe negative pole. Now when I bring two red ends, that is, two\r\npositive poles together, they drive each other away. See! the\r\nmagnet I am not holding runs away from the other. But if I bring\r\na red end and a black end, that is, a positive and a negative end\r\ntogether, then they are attracted and cling. I will make a\r\ntriangle (A, Fig. 21) in which a black end and a red end always\r\ncome together, and you see the triangle holds together. But now if\r\nI take off the lower bar and turn it (B, Fig. 21) so that two red\r\nends and two black ends come together, then this bar actually\r\nrolls back from the others down the cardboard. If I were to break\r\nthese bars into a thousand pieces, each piece would still have two\r\npoles, and if they were scattered about near each other in such a\r\nway that they were quite free to move, they would arrange\r\nthemselves always so two different poles came together.\r\n\r\nNow picture to yourselves that all the particles of those\r\nsubstances which form crystals have poles like our magnets, then\r\nyou can imagine that when the heat which held them apart is\r\nwithdrawn and the particles come very near together, they will\r\narrange themselves according to the attraction of their poles and\r\nso build up regular and beautiful patterns.\r\n\r\nSo, if we could travel up to the clouds where this fairy power of\r\ncrystallization is at work, we should find the particles of\r\nwater-vapour in a freezing atmosphere being built up into minute\r\nsolid crystals of snow. If you go out after a snow-shower and\r\nsearch carefully, you will see that the snow-flakes are not mere\r\nlumps of frozen water, but beautiful six-pointed crystal stars, so\r\nwhite and pure that when we want to speak of anything being\r\nspotlessly white, you say that it is \"white as snow.\" Some of\r\nthese crystals are simply flat slabs with six sides, others are\r\nstars with six rods or spikes springing from the centre, others\r\nwith six spikes each formed like a delicate fern. No less than a\r\nthousand different forms of delicate crystals have been found\r\namong snowflakes, but though there is such a great variety, yet\r\nthey are all built on the six-sided and six-pointed plan, and are\r\nall rendered dazzlingly white by the reflection of the light from\r\nthe faces of the crystals and the tiny air-bubbles built up within\r\nthem. This, you see, is why, when the snow melts, you have only a\r\nlittle dirty water in your hand; the crystals are gone and there\r\nare no more air-bubbles held prisoners to act as looking-glasses\r\nto the light. Hoar-frost is also made up of tiny water-crystals,\r\nand is nothing more than frozen dew hanging on the blades of grass\r\nand from the trees.\r\n\r\nBut how about ice? Here, you will say, is frozen water, and yet\r\nwe see no crystals, only a clear transparent mass. Here, again,\r\nDr. Tyndall helps us. He says (and as I have proved it true, so\r\nmay you for yourselves, if you will) that if you take a\r\nmagnifying glass, and look down on the surface of ice on a sunny\r\nday, you will see a number of dark, six-sided stars, looking like\r\nflattened flowers, and in the centre of each a bright spot. These\r\nflowers, which are seen when the ice is melting, are our old\r\nfriends the crystal stars turning into water, and the\r\nbright spot in the middle is a bubble of empty space, left\r\nbecause the watery flower does not fill up as much room as the\r\nice of the crystal star did.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to notice that ice always takes up more room\r\nthan water, and that this is the reason why our water-pipes burst\r\nin severe frosts; for as the water freezes it expands with great\r\nforce, and the pipe is cracked, and then when the thaw comes on ,\r\nand the water melts again, it pours through the crack it has\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand why ice should take more room;\r\nfor we know that if we were to try to arrange bricks end to end\r\nin star-like shapes, we must leave some spaces between, and could\r\nnot pack them so closely as if they lay side by side. And so,\r\nwhen this giant force of crystallization constrains the atoms of\r\nfrozen water to grow into star-like forms, the solid mass must\r\nfill more room than the liquid water, and when the star\r\nmelts, this space reveals itself to us in the bright spot of the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen our drop of water under all its various forms of\r\ninvisible gas, visible steam, cloud, dew, hoar-frost, snow, and\r\nice, and we have only time shortly to see it on its travels, not\r\nmerely up and down, as hitherto, but round the world.\r\n\r\nWe must first go to the sea as the distillery, or the place from\r\nwhich water is drawn up invisibly, in its purest state, into the\r\nair; and we must go chiefly to the seas of the tropics, because\r\nhere the sun shines most directly all the year round, sending\r\nheat-waves to shake the water-particles asunder. It has been\r\nfound by experiment that, in order to turn 1 lb. of water into\r\nvapour, as much heat must be used as is required to melt 5 lbs.\r\nof iron; and if you consider for a moment how difficult iron is\r\nto melt, and how we can keep an iron poker in a hot fire and yet\r\nit remains solid, this will help you to realize how much heat the\r\nsun must pour down in order to carry off such a constant supply\r\nof vapour from the tropical seas.\r\n\r\nNow, when all this vapour is drawn up into the air, we know that\r\nsome of it will form into clouds as it gets chilled high up in\r\nthe sky, and then it will pour down again in those tremendous\r\nfloods of rain which occur in the tropics.\r\n\r\nBut the sun and air will not let it all fall down at once, and\r\nthe winds which are blowing from the equator to the poles carry\r\nlarge masses of it away with them. Then, as you know, it will\r\ndepend on many things how far this vapour is carried. Some of it,\r\nchilled by cold blasts, or by striking on cold mountain tops, as\r\nit travels northwards, will fall in rain in Europe and Asia, while\r\nthat which travels southwards may fall in South America,\r\nAustralia, or New Zealand, or be carried over the sea to the South\r\nPole. Wherever it falls on the land as rain, and is not used by\r\nplants, it will do one of two things; either it will run down in\r\nstreams and form brooks and rivers, and so at last find its way\r\nback to the sea, or it will sink deep in the earth till it comes\r\nupon some hard rock through which it cannot get, and then, being\r\nhard pressed by the water coming on behind, it will rise up again\r\nthrough cracks, and come to the surface as a spring. These\r\nsprings, again, feed rivers, sometimes above- ground, sometimes\r\nfor long distances under-ground; but one way or another at last\r\nthe whole drains back into the sea.\r\n\r\nBut if the vapour travels on till it reaches high mountains in\r\ncooler lands, such as the Alps of Switzerland; or is carried to\r\nthe poles and to such countries as Greenland or the Antarctic\r\nContinent, then it will come down as snow, forming immense snow-\r\nfields. And here a curious change takes place in it. If you make\r\nan ordinary snowball and work it firmly together, it becomes very\r\nhard, and if you then press it forcibly into a mould you can turn\r\nit into transparent ice. And in the same way the snow which falls\r\nin Greenland and on the high mountains of Switzerland becomes\r\nvery firmly pressed together, as it slides down into the valleys.\r\nIt is like a crowd of people passing from a broad thoroughfare\r\ninto a narrow street. As the valley grows narrower and\r\nnarrower the great mass of snow in front cannot move down\r\nquickly, while more and more is piled up by the snowfall behind,\r\nand the crowd and crush grow denser and denser. In this way the\r\nsnow is pressed together till the air that was hidden in its\r\ncrystals, and which gave it its beautiful whiteness, is all\r\npressed out, and the snow-crystals themselves are squeezed into\r\none solid mass of pure, transparent ice.\r\n\r\nThen we have what is called a \"glacier,\" or river of ice, and\r\nthis solid river comes creeping down till, in Greenland, it\r\nreaches the edge of the sea. There it is pushed over the brink of\r\nthe land, and large pieces snap off, and we have \"icebergs.\"\r\nThese icebergs - made, remember, of the same water which was\r\nfirst draw up from the tropics - float on the wide sea, and\r\nmelting in its warm currents, topple over and over* (A floating\r\niceberg must have about eight times as much ice under the water\r\nas it has above, and therefore, when the lower part melts in a\r\nwarm current, the iceberg loses its balance and tilts over, so as\r\nto rearrange itself round the centre of gravity.) till they\r\ndisappear and mix with the water, to be carried back again to the\r\nwarm ocean from which they first started. In Switzerland the\r\nglaciers cannot reach the sea, but they move down into the\r\nvalleys till they come to a warmer region, and there the end of\r\nthe glacier melts, and flows away in a stream. The Rhone and many\r\nother rivers are fed by the glaciers of the Alps; and as these\r\nrivers flow into the sea, our drop of water again finds its way\r\nback to its home.\r\n\r\nBut when it joins itself in this way to its companions, from whom\r\nit was parted for a time, does it come back clear and transparent\r\nas it left them? From the iceberg it does indeed return pure and\r\nclear; for the fairy Crystallization will have no impurities, not\r\neven salt, in her ice-crystals, and so as they melt they give back\r\nnothing but pure water to the sea. Yet even icebergs bring down\r\nearth and stones frozen into the bottom of the ice, and so they\r\nfeed the sea with mud.\r\n\r\nBut the drops of water in rivers are by no means as pure as when\r\nthey rose up into the sky. We shall see in the next lecture how\r\nrivers carry down not only sand and mud all along their course,\r\nbut even solid matter such as salt, lime, iron, and flint,\r\ndissolved in the clear water, just as sugar is dissolved, without\r\nour being able to see it. The water, too, which has sunk down\r\ninto the earth, takes up much matter as it travels along. You all\r\nknow that the water you drink from a spring is very different\r\nfrom rain-water, and you will often find a hard crust at the\r\nbottom of kettles and in boilers, which is formed of the\r\ncarbonate of lime which is driven out of the clear water when it\r\nis boiled. The water has become \"hard\" in consequence of having\r\npicked up and dissolved the carbonate of lime on its way through\r\nthe earth, just in the same way as water would become sweet if\r\nyou poured it through a sugar-cask. You will also have heard of\r\niron-springs, sulphur-springs, and salt-springs, which come out\r\nof the earth, even if you have never tasted any of them, and the\r\nwater of all these springs finds its way back at last to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAnd now, can you understand why sea-water should taste\r\nsalt and bitter? Every drop of water which flows from the earth\r\nto the sea carries something with it. Generally, there is so\r\nlittle of any substance in the water that we cannot taste it, and\r\nwe call it pure water; but the purest of spring or river-water\r\nhas always some solid matter dissolved in it, and all this goes\r\nto the sea. Now, when the sun-waves come to take the water out of\r\nthe sea again, they will have nothing but the pure water itself;\r\nand so all these salts and carbonates and other solid substances\r\nare left behind, and we taste them in sea-water.\r\n\r\nSome day, when you are at the seaside, take some extra water and\r\nset it on the hob till a great deal has simmered gently away, and\r\nthe liquid is very thick. Then take a drop of this liquid, and\r\nexamine it under a microscope. As it dries up gradually, you will\r\nsee a number of crystals forming, some square - and these will be\r\ncrystals of ordinary salt; some oblong - these will be crystals\r\nof gypsum or alabaster; and others of various shapes. Then, when\r\nyou see how much matter from the land is contained in sea-water,\r\nyou will no longer wonder that the sea is salt; on the contrary,\r\nyou will ask, Why does it not grow salter every year?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this scarcely belongs to our history of a drop of\r\nwater, but I must just suggest it to you. In the sea are numbers\r\nof soft-bodied animals, like the jelly animals which form the\r\ncoral, which require hard material for their shells or the solid\r\nbranches on which they live, and they are greedily watching for\r\nthese atoms of lime, of flint, or magnesia, and of other\r\nsubstances brought down into the sea. It is with lime and magnesia\r\nthat the tiny chalk-builders form their beautiful shells, and the\r\ncoral animals their skeletons, while another class of builders use\r\nthe flint; and when these creatures die, their remains go to form\r\nfresh land at the bottom of the sea; and so, though the earth is\r\nbeing washed away by the rivers and springs it is being built up\r\nagain, out of the same materials, in the depths of the great\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have reached the end of the travels of our drop of\r\nwater. We have seen it drawn up by the fairy \"heat,\" invisible\r\ninto the sky; there fairy \"cohesion\" seized it and formed it into\r\nwater-drops and the giant, \"gravitation,\" pulled it down again to\r\nthe earth. Or, if it rose to freezing regions, the fairy of\r\n\"crystallization\" built it up into snow-crystals, again to fall\r\nto the earth, and either to be melted back into water by heat, or\r\nto slide down the valleys by force of gravitation, till it became\r\nsqueezed into ice. We have detected it, when invisible, forming a\r\nveil round our earth, and keeping off the intense heat of the\r\nsun's rays by day, or shutting it in by night. We have seen it\r\nchilled by the blades of grass, forming sparkling dew-drops or\r\ncrystals of hoar-frost, glistening in the early morning sun; and\r\nwe have seen it in the dark underground, being drunk up greedily\r\nby the roots of plants. We have started with it from the tropics,\r\nand travelled over land and sea, watching it forming rivers, or\r\nflowing underground in springs, or moving onwards to the high\r\nmountains or the poles, and coming back again in glaciers and\r\nicebergs. Through all this, while it is being carried\r\nhither and thither by invisible power, we find no trace of its\r\nbecoming worn out, or likely to rest from its labours. Ever\r\nonwards it goes, up and down, and round and round the world,\r\ntaking many forms, and performing many wonderful feats. We have\r\nseen some of the work that it does, in refreshing the air,\r\nfeeding the plants, giving us clear, sparkling water to drink,\r\nand carrying matter to the sea; but besides this, it does a\r\nwonderful work in altering all the face of our earth. This work\r\nwe shall consider in the next lecture, on \"The two great\r\nSculptors - Water and Ice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 13\r\n\r\nLECTURE V. THE TWO GREAT SCULPTORS - WATER AND ICE.\r\n\r\nIn our last lecture we saw that water can exist in three forms:--\r\n1st, as an invisible vapour; 2nd, as liquid water; 3rd, as solid\r\nsnow and ice.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are going to take the two last of these\r\nforms, water and ice, and speak of them as sculptors.\r\n\r\nTo understand why they deserve this name we must first consider\r\nwhat the work of a sculptor is. If you go into a statuary yard\r\nyou will find there large blocks of granite, marble, and other\r\nkinds of stone, hewn roughly into different shapes; but if you\r\npass into the studio, where the sculptor himself is at work you\r\nwill find beautiful statues, more or less finished;  and you will\r\nsee that out of rough blocks of stone he has been able to cut\r\nimages which look like living forms. You can even see by their\r\nfaces whether they are intended to be sad, or thoughtful, or\r\ngay, and by their attitude whether they are writhing in pain,\r\nor dancing with joy, or resting peacefully. How has all this\r\nhistory been worked out from the shapeless stone? It has been\r\ndone by the sculptor's chisel. A piece chipped off here,  a\r\nwrinkle cut there, a smooth surface rounded off in another place,\r\nso as to give a gentle curve; all these touches gradually shape\r\nthe figure and mould it out of the rough stone, first into a\r\nrude shape and afterwards, by delicate strokes, into the form of\r\na living being.\r\n\r\nNow, just in the same way as the wrinkles and curves of a statue\r\nare cut by the sculptor's chisel, so the hills and valleys, the\r\nsteep slopes and gentle curves on the face of our earth, giving\r\nit all its beauty, and the varied landscapes we love so well,\r\nhave been cut out by water and ice passing over them. It is true\r\nthat some of the greater wrinkles of the earth, the lofty\r\nmountains, and the high masses of land which rise above the sea ,\r\nhave been caused by earthquakes and shrinking of the\r\nearth. We shall not speak of these to-day, but put them aside as\r\nbelonging to the rough work of the statuary yard. But when once\r\nthese large masses are put ready for water to work upon, then\r\nall the rest of the rugged wrinkles and gentle slopes which make\r\nthe country so beautiful are due to water and ice, and for this\r\nreason I have called them \"sculptors.\"\r\n\r\nGo for a walk in the country, or notice the landscape as you\r\ntravel on a railway journey. You pass by hills and through\r\nvalleys, through narrow steep gorges cut in hard rock, or\r\nthrough wild ravines up the sides of which you can hardly\r\nscramble. Then you come to grassy slopes and to smooth plains\r\nacross which you can look for miles without seeing a hill; or,\r\nwhen you arrive at the seashore, you clamber into caves and\r\ngrottos, and along dark narrow passages leading from one bay to\r\nanother. All these - hills, valleys,  gorges, ravines, slopes,\r\nplains, caves, grottos, and rocky shores - have been cut out by\r\nthe water. Day by day and year by year, while everything seems\r\nto us to remain the same, this industrious sculptor is chipping\r\naway,  a few grains here, a corner there, a large mass in another\r\nplace, till he gives to the country its own peculiar scenery,\r\njust as the human sculptor gives expression to his statue.\r\n\r\nOur work to-day will consist in trying to form some idea of the\r\nway in which water thus carves out the surface of the earth, and\r\nwe will begin by seeing how much can be done by our old friends\r\nthe rain-drops before they become running streams.\r\n\r\nEveryone must have noticed that whenever rain falls on soft\r\nground it makes small round holes in which it\r\ncollects, and then sinks into the ground, forcing its way\r\nbetween the grains of earth. But you would hardly think that the\r\nbeautiful pillars in Fig. 24 have been made entirely in this way\r\nby rain beating upon and soaking into the ground.\r\n\r\nWhere these pillars stand there was once a solid mass of clay and\r\nstones,  into which the rain-drops crept, loosening the earthly\r\nparticles; and then when the sun dried the earth again cracks\r\nwere formed, so that the next shower loosened it still more, and\r\ncarried some of the mud down into the valley below. But here and\r\nthere large stones were buried in the clay, and where this\r\nhappened the rain could not penetrate, and the stones\r\nbecame the tops of tall pillars of clay, washed into shape by the\r\nrain beating on its sides, but escaping the general destruction\r\nof the rest of the mud. In this way the whole valley has been\r\ncarved out into fine pillars,  some still having capping-stones,\r\nwhile others have lost them, and these last will soon be washed\r\naway. We have no such valleys of earth-pillars here in England,\r\nbut you may sometimes see tiny pillars under bridges where the\r\ndrippings have washed away the earth between the pebbles, and\r\nsuch small examples which you can observe for yourselves are\r\nquite as instructive as more important ones.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which rain changes the surface of the earth is by\r\nsinking down through loose soil from the top of a cliff to a\r\ndepth of many feet till it comes to solid rock, and then lying\r\nspread over a wide apace. Here it makes a kind of watery mud,\r\nwhich is a very unsafe foundation for the hill of earth above\r\nit, and so after a time the whole mass slips down and makes a\r\nfresh piece of land at the foot of the cliff. If you have ever\r\nbeen at the Isle of Wight you will have seen an undulating strip\r\nof ground, called the Undercliff, at Ventnor and other places,\r\nstretching all along the sea below the high cliffs. This land\r\nwas once at the top of the cliff, and came down by succession of\r\nlandslips such as we have been describing. A very great landslip\r\nof this kind happened in the memory of living people, at Lyme\r\nRegis, in Dorsetshire, in the year 1839.\r\n\r\nYou will easily see how in forming earth-pillars and causing\r\nlandslips rain changes the face of the country, but\r\nthese are only rare effects of water. It is when the rain\r\ncollects in brooks and forms rivers that it is most busy in\r\nsculpturing the land. Look out some day into the road or the\r\ngarden where the ground slopes a little, and watch what happens\r\nduring a shower of rain. First the rain-drops run together in\r\nevery little hollow of the ground, then the water begins to flow\r\nalong any ruts or channels it can find, lying here and there in\r\npools, but always making its way gradually down the slope.\r\nMeanwhile from other parts of the ground little rills are\r\ncoming, and these all meet in some larger ruts where the ground\r\nis lowest,  making one great stream, which at last empties itself\r\ninto the gutter or an area, or finds its way down some grating.\r\n\r\nNow just this, which we can watch whenever a heavy shower of rain\r\ncomes down on the road, happens also all over the world. Up in\r\nthe mountains,  where there is always a great deal of rain,\r\nlittle rills gather and fall over the mountain sides, meeting in\r\nsome stream below. Then, as this stream flows on, it is fed by\r\nmany runnels of water, which come from all parts of the country,\r\ntrickling along ruts, and flowing in small brooks and rivulets\r\ndown the gentle slope of the land till they reach the big stream,\r\nwhich at last is important enough to be called a river.\r\nSometimes this river comes to a large hollow in the land and\r\nthere the water gathers and forms a lake; but still at the lower\r\nend of this lake out it comes again, forming a new river,  and\r\ngrowing and growing by receiving fresh streams until at last it\r\nreaches the sea.\r\n\r\nThe River Thames, which you all know, and whose course you will\r\nfind clearly described in Mr. Huxley's 'Physiography,' drains in\r\nthis way no less than one-seventh of the whole of England. All the\r\nrain which falls in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Middlesex,\r\nHertfordshire, Surrey, the north of Wiltshire and north-west of\r\nKent, the south of Buckinghamshire and of Gloucestershire, finds\r\nits way into the Thames; making an area of 6160 square miles over\r\nwhich every rivulet and brook trickle down to the one great river,\r\nwhich bears them to the ocean. And so with every other area of\r\nland in the world there is some one channel towards which the\r\nground on all sides slopes gently down, and into this channel all\r\nthe water will run, on its way to the sea.\r\n\r\nBut what has this to do with sculpture or cutting out of valleys?\r\nIf you will only take a glass of water out of any river, and let\r\nit stand for some hours, you will soon answer this question for\r\nyourself. For you will find that even from river water which\r\nlooks quite clear, a thin layer of mud will fall to the bottom\r\nof the glass, and if you take the water when the river is\r\nswollen and muddy you will get quite a thick deposit. This shows\r\nthat the brooks, the streams, and the rivers wash away the land\r\nas they flow over it and carry it from the mountains down to the\r\nvalleys, and from the valleys away out into the sea.\r\n\r\nBut besides earthly matter, which we can see, there is much\r\nmatter dissolved in the water of rivers (as we mentioned in the\r\nlast lecture), and this we cannot see.\r\n\r\nIf you use water which comes out of a chalk country you will find\r\nthat after a time the kettle in which you have been in the habit\r\nof boiling this water has a hard crust on its bottom and sides,\r\nand this crust is made of chalk or carbonate of lime,\r\nwhich the water took out of the rocks when it was passing\r\nthrough them. Professor Bischoff has calculated that the river\r\nRhine carries past Bonn every year enough carbonate of lime\r\ndissolved in its water to make 332,000 million oyster-shells,\r\nand that if all these shells were built into a cube it would\r\nmeasure 560 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 14\r\n\r\nImagine to yourselves the whole of St. Paul's churchyard filled\r\nwith oyster-shells, built up in a large square till they reached\r\nhalf as high again as the top of the cathedral, then you will\r\nhave some idea of the amount of chalk carried invisibly past\r\nBonn in the water of the Rhine every year.\r\n\r\nSince all this matter, whether brought down as mud or dissolved,\r\ncomes from one part of the land to be carried elsewhere or out\r\nto sea, it is clear that some gaps and hollows must be left in\r\nthe places from which it is taken. Let us see how these gaps are\r\nmade. Have you ever clambered up the mountainside,  or even up\r\none of those small ravines in the hillside, which have generally\r\na little stream trickling through them? If so, you must have\r\nnoticed the number of pebbles, large and small, lying in patches\r\nhere and there in the stream, and many pieces of broken rock,\r\nwhich are often scattered along the sides of the ravine; and\r\nhow, as you climb, the path grows steeper, and the rocks become\r\nrugged and stick out in strange shapes.\r\n\r\nThe history of this ravine will tell us a great deal about the\r\ncarving of water. Once it was nothing more than a little furrow\r\nin the hillside down which the rain found its way in a thin\r\nthread-like stream. But by and by, as the stream carried down\r\nsome of the earth, and the furrow grew deeper and wider, the sides\r\nbegan to crumble when the sun dried up the rain which had soaked\r\nin. Then in winter, when the sides of the hill were moist with the\r\nautumn rains, frost came and turned the water to ice, and so made\r\nthe cracks still larger, and the swollen steam rushing down,\r\ncaught the loose pieces of rock and washed them down into its bed.\r\nHere they were rolled over and over, and grated against each\r\nother, and were ground away till they became rounded pebbles, such\r\nas lie in the foreground of the picture (Fig. 25); while the grit\r\nwhich was rubbed off them was carried farther down by the stream.\r\nAnd so in time this became a little valley, and as the stream cut\r\nit deeper and deeper, there was room to clamber along the sides of\r\nit, and ferns and mosses began to cover the naked stone, and small\r\ntrees rooted themselves along the banks, and this beautiful little\r\nnook sprang up on the hill-side entirely by the sculpturing of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nShall you not feel a fresh interest in all the little valleys,\r\nravines, and gorges you meet with in the country, if you can\r\npicture them being formed in this way year by year? There are\r\nmany curious differences in them which you can study for\r\nyourselves. Some will be smooth, broad valleys and here the\r\nrocks have been soft and easily worn, and water trickling down\r\nthe sides of the first valley has cut other channels so as to\r\nmake smaller valleys running across it. In other places there\r\nwill be narrow ravines, and here the rocks have been hard, so\r\nthat they did not wear away gradually, but broke off and fell in\r\nblocks, leaving high cliffs on each side. In some places you\r\nwill come to a beautiful waterfall, where the water has tumbled\r\nover a steep cliff, and then eaten its way back, just like a saw\r\ncutting through a piece of wood.\r\n\r\nThere are two things in particular to notice in a waterfall like\r\nthis.  First, how the water and spray dash against the bottom of\r\nthe cliff down which it falls, and grind the small pebbles\r\nagainst the rock. In this way the bottom of the cliff is\r\nundermined, and so great pieces tumble down from time to time,\r\nand keep the fall upright instead of its being sloped away at the\r\ntop, and becoming a mere steam. Secondly, you may often see\r\ncurious cup-shaped holes, called \"pot-holes,\" in the rocks on the\r\nsides of a waterfall, and these also are concerned in its\r\nformation. In these holes you will generally find two or three\r\nsmall pebbles, and you have here a beautiful example of how water\r\nuses stones to grind away the face of the earth. These holes are\r\nmade entirely by the falling water eddying round and round in a\r\nsmall hollow of the rock, and grinding the pebbles which it has\r\nbrought down, against the bottom and sides of this hollow, just as\r\nyou grind round a pestle in a mortar. By degrees the hole grows\r\ndeeper and deeper and though the first pebbles are probably ground\r\ndown to powder, others fall in, and so in time there is a great\r\nhole perforated right through, helping to make the rock break and\r\nfall away.\r\n\r\nIn this and other ways the water works its way back in a\r\nsurprising manner.  The Isle of Wight gives us some good\r\ninstances of this; Alum Bay Chine and the celebrated Blackgang\r\nChine have been entirely cut out by waterfalls. But the best\r\nknow and most remarkable example is the Niagara Falls, in\r\nAmerica.  Here, the River Niagara first wanders through a flat\r\ncountry, and then reaches the great Lake Erie in a hollow of the\r\nplain. After that, it flows gently down for about fifteen miles,\r\nand then the slope becomes greater and it rushes on to the Falls\r\nof Niagara. These falls are not nearly so high as many people\r\nimagine, being only 165 feet, or about half the height of St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral, but they are 2700 feet or nearly half-a-mile\r\nwide, and no less than 670,000 tons of water fall\r\nover them every minute,  making magnificent clouds of spray.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, when he was at Niagara, came to the conclusion\r\nthat,  taking one year with another, these falls eat back the\r\ncliff at the rate of about one foot a year, as you can easily\r\nimagine they would do, when you think with what force the water\r\nmust dash against the bottom of the falls.  In this way a deep\r\ncleft has been cut right back from Queenstown for a distance of\r\nseven miles, to the place where the falls are now. This helps us\r\na little to understand how very slowly and gradually\r\nwater cuts its way; for if a foot a year is about the average of\r\nthe waste of the rock,  it will have taken more than thirty-five\r\nthousand years for that channel of seven miles to be made.\r\n\r\nBut even this chasm cut by the falls of Niagara is nothing\r\ncompared with the canyons of Colarado. Canyon is a Spanish word\r\nfor a rocky gorge, and these gorges are indeed so grand, that if\r\nwe had not seen in other places what water can do, we should\r\nnever have been able to believe that it could have cut out these\r\ngigantic chasms. For more than three hundred miles the River\r\nColorado, coming down from the Rocky Mountains, has eaten its way\r\nthrough a country made of granite and hard beds of limestone and\r\nsandstone, and it has cut down straight through these rocks,\r\nleaving walls from half-a-mile to a mile high, standing straight\r\nup from it. The cliffs of the Great Canyon, as it is called,\r\nstretch up for more than a mile above the river which flows in\r\nthe gorge below! Fancy yourselves for a moment in a boat on this\r\nriver, as shown in Figure 27, and looking up at these gigantic\r\nwalls of rock towering above you. Even half-way up them, a man,\r\nif he could get there, would be so small you could not see him\r\nwithout a telescope; while the opening at the top between the\r\ntwo walls would seem so narrow at such an immense distance that\r\nthe sky above would have the appearance of nothing more than a\r\nnarrow streak of blue. Yet these huge chasms have not been made\r\nby any violent breaking apart of the rocks or convulsion of an\r\nearthquake. No, they have been gradually, silently, and steadily\r\ncut through by the river which now glides quietly in the wider\r\nchasms, or rushes rapidly through the narrow gorges at their feet.\r\n\r\n\"No description,\" says Lieutenant Ives, one of the first\r\nexplorers of this river, \"can convey the idea of the varied and\r\nmajestic grandeur of this peerless waterway. Wherever the river\r\nturns, the entire panorama changes.  Stately facades, august\r\ncathedrals, amphitheatres, rotundas, castellated walls, and rows\r\nof time-stained ruins, surmounted by every form of tower,\r\nminaret, dome and spire, have been moulded from the cyclopean\r\nmasses of rock that form the mighty defile.\" Who will say, after\r\nthis, that water is not the grandest of all sculptors, as it\r\ncuts through hundreds of miles of rock,  forming such magnificent\r\ngranite groups, not only unsurpassed but unequalled by any of\r\nthe works of man?\r\n\r\nBut we must not look upon water only as a cutting instrument, for\r\nit does more than merely carve out land in one place, it also\r\ncarries it away and lays it down elsewhere; and in this it is\r\nmore like a modeller in clay, who smooths off the material from\r\none part of his figure to put it upon another.\r\n\r\nRunning water is not only always carrying away mud, but at the\r\nsame time laying it down here and there wherever it flows. When\r\na torrent brings down stones and gravel from the mountains, it\r\nwill depend on the size and weight of the pieces how long they\r\nwill be in falling through the water. If you take a handful of\r\ngravel and throw it into a glass full of water, you will notice\r\nthat the stones in it will fall to the bottom at once, the grit\r\nand coarse sand will take longer in sinking, and lastly, the fine\r\nsand will be an hour or two in settling down, so that the water\r\nbecomes clear. Now, suppose that this gravel were sinking in the\r\nwater of a river. The stones would be buoyed up as long as the\r\nriver was very full and flowed very quickly, but they would drop\r\nthrough sooner than the coarse sand. The coarse sand in its turn\r\nwould begin to sink as the river flowed more slowly, and would\r\nreach the bottom while the fine sand was still borne on. Lastly,\r\nthe fine sand would sink through very, very slowly, and only\r\nsettle in comparatively still water.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will happen that stones will generally lie near to\r\nthe bottom of torrents at the foot of the banks from which they\r\nfall, while the gravel will be carried on by the stream after it\r\nleaves the mountains. This too,  however, will be laid down when\r\nthe river comes into a more level country and runs more slowly.\r\nOr it may be left together with the finer mud in a lake, as in\r\nthe lake of Geneva, into which the Rhone flows laden with mud\r\nand comes out at the other end clear and pure. But if no lake\r\nlies in the way the finer earth will still travel on, and the\r\nriver will take up more and more as it flows, till at last it\r\nwill leave this too on the plains across which it moves\r\nsluggishly along, or will deposit it at its mouth when it joins\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 15\r\n\r\nYou all know the history of the Nile; how, when the rains fall\r\nvery heavily in March and April in the mountains of Abyssinia,\r\nthe river comes rushing down and brings with it a load of mud\r\nwhich it spreads out over the Nile valley in Egypt. This annual\r\nlayer of mud is so thin that it takes a thousand years for it to\r\nbecome 2 or 3 feet thick; but besides that which falls in the\r\nvalley a great deal is taken to the mouth of the river and there\r\nforms new land, making what is called the \"Delta\" of the Nile.\r\nAlexandria, Rosetta, and Damietta, are towns which are all built\r\non land made of Nile mud which was carried down ages and ages ago,\r\nand which has now become firm and hard like the rest of the\r\ncountry. You will easily remember other deltas mentioned in books,\r\nand all these are made of the mud carried down from the land to\r\nthe sea. The delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra in India, is\r\nactually as large as the whole of England and Wales, (58,311\r\nsquare miles.) and the River Mississippi in America drains such a\r\nlarge tract of country that its delta grows, Mr. Geikie tells us,\r\nat the rate of 86 yards in year.\r\n\r\nAll this new land laid down in Egypt, in India, in America, and\r\nin other places, is the work of water. Even on the Thames you\r\nmay see mud-banks, as at Gravesend, which are made of earth\r\nbrought from the interior of England.  But at the mouth of the\r\nThames the sea washes up very strongly every tide,  and so it\r\ncarries most of the mud away and prevents a delta growing up\r\nthere. If you will look about when you are at the seaside, and\r\nnotice wherever a stream flows down into the sea, you may even\r\nsee little miniature deltas being formed there, though the sea\r\ngenerally washes them away again in a few hours, unless the\r\nplace is well sheltered.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is what becomes of the earth carried down by rivers.\r\nEither on plains, or in lakes, or in the sea, it falls down to\r\nform new land. But what becomes of the dissolved chalk and other\r\nsubstances? We have seen that a great deal of it is used by river\r\nand sea animals to build their shells and skeletons, and some of\r\nit is left on the surface of the ground by springs when the water\r\nevaporates. It is this carbonate of lime which forms a hard crust\r\nover anything upon which it may happen to be deposited, and then\r\nthese things are called \"petrified.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is in the caves and hollows of the earth that this\r\ndissolved matter is built up into the most beautiful forms. If\r\nyou have ever been to Buxton in Derbyshire, you will probably\r\nhave visited a cavern called Poole's Cavern, not far from there,\r\nwhich when you enter it looks as if it were built up entirely of\r\nrods of beautiful transparent white glass, hanging from the\r\nceiling, from the walls, or rising up from the floor. In this\r\ncavern,  and many others like it,*(See the picture at the head of\r\nthe lecture.) water comes dripping through the roof, and as it\r\nfalls carbonate of lime forms itself into a thin, white film on\r\nthe roof, often making a complete circle,  and then, as the water\r\ndrips from it day by day, it goes on growing and growing till it\r\nforms a long needle-shaped or tube-shaped rod, hanging like an\r\nicicle. These rods are called stalactites, and they are so\r\nbeautiful, as their minute crystals glisten when a light is\r\ntaken into the cavern, that one of them near Tenby is called the\r\n\"Fairy Chamber.\" Meanwhile, the water which drips on to the\r\nfloor also leaves some carbonate of lime where it falls, and this\r\nforms a pillar, growing up towards the roof, and often the hanging\r\nstalactites and the rising pillars (called stalagmites) meet in\r\nthe middle and form one column. And thus we see that underground,\r\nas well as aboveground, water moulds beautiful forms in the crust\r\nof the earth. At Adelsberg, near Trieste, there is a magnificent\r\nstalactite grotto made of a number of chambers one following\r\nanother, with a river flowing through them; and the famous Mammoth\r\nCave of Kentucky, more than ten miles long, is another example of\r\nthese wonderful limestone caverns.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet spoken of the sea, and this surely is not\r\nidle in altering the shape of the land. Even the waves\r\nthemselves in a storm wash against the cliffs and bring down\r\nstones and pieces of rock on to the shore below. And they help\r\nto make cracks and holes in the cliffs, for as they dash with\r\nforce against them they compress the air which lies in the joints\r\nof the stone and cause it to force the rock apart, and so larger\r\ncracks are made and the cliff is ready to crumble.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the stones and sand and pieces of rock lying at\r\nthe foot of the cliff which are most active in wearing it away.\r\nHave you never watched the waves breaking upon a beach in a\r\nheavy storm? How they catch up the stones and hurl them down\r\nagain, grinding them against each other! At high tide in such a\r\nstorm these stones are thrown against the foot of the cliff,  and\r\neach blow does something towards knocking away part of the rock,\r\ntill at last, after many storms, the cliff is undermined and large\r\npieces fall down. These pieces are in their turn ground down to\r\npebbles which serve to batter against the remaining rock.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie tells us that the waves beat in a storm against\r\nthe Bell Rock Lighthouse with as much force as if you dashed a\r\nweight of 3 tons against every square inch of the rock, and\r\nStevenson found stones of 2 tons'  weight which had been thrown\r\nduring storms right over the ledge of the lighthouse. Think what\r\nforce there must be in waves which can lift up such a rock and\r\nthrow it, and such force as this beats upon our sea-coasts and\r\neats away the land.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 is a sketch on the shores of Arbroath which I made some\r\nyears ago.  You will not find it difficult to picture to\r\nyourselves how the sea has eaten away these cliffs till some of\r\nthe strongest pieces which have resisted the waves stand out by\r\nthemselves in the sea. That cave in the left-hand corner ends in a\r\nnarrow dark passage from which you come out on the other side of\r\nthe rocks into another bay. Such caves as these are made chiefly\r\nby the force of the waves and the air, bringing down pieces of\r\nrock from under the cliff and so making a cavity, and then as the\r\nwaves roll these pieces over and over and grind them against the\r\nsides, the hole is made larger. There are many places on the\r\nEnglish coast where large pieces of the road are destroyed by the\r\ncrumbling down of cliffs when they have been undermined by caverns\r\nsuch as these.\r\n\r\nThus, you see, the whole of the beautiful scenery of the sea -\r\nthe shores,  the steep cliffs, the quiet bays, the creeks and\r\ncaverns - are all the work of the \"sculptor\" water; and he works\r\nbest where the rocks are hardest, for there they offer him a\r\ngood stout wall to batter, whereas in places where the ground is\r\nsoft it washes down into a gradual gentle slope, and so the\r\nwaves come flowing smoothly in and have no power to eat away the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what has Ice got to do with the sculpturing of the land?\r\nFirst, we must remember how much the frost does in breaking up\r\nthe ground. The farmers know this, and always plough after a\r\nfrost, because the moisture, freezing in the ground, has broken\r\nup the clods, and done half their work for them.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the chief work of ice. You will remember how we\r\nlearnt in our last lecture that snow, when it falls on the\r\nmountains, gradually slides down into the valleys, and is pressed\r\ntogether by the gathering snow behind until it becomes moulded\r\ninto a solid river of ice (see Fig. 29, Frontispiece). In\r\nGreenland and in Norway there are enormous ice-rivers or glaciers,\r\nand even in Switzerland some of them are very large. The Aletsch\r\nglacier, in the Alps, is fifteen miles long, and some are even\r\nlonger than this. They move very slowly - on an average about 20\r\nto 27 inches in the centre, and 13 to 19 inches at the sides every\r\ntwenty-four hours, in the summer and autumn. How they move, we\r\ncannot stop to discuss now; but if you will take a slab of thin\r\nice and rest it upon its two ends only, you can prove to yourself\r\nthat ice does bend, for in a few hours you will find that its own\r\nweight has drawn it down in the centre, so as to form a curve.\r\nThis will help you to picture to yourselves how glaciers can adapt\r\nthemselves to the windings of the valley, creeping slowly onwards\r\nuntil they come down to a point where the air is warm enough to\r\nmelt them, and then the ice flows away in a stream of water. It is\r\nvery curious to see the number of little rills running down the\r\ngreat masses of ice at the glacier's mouth, bringing down with\r\nthem gravel, and every now and then a large stone, which falls\r\nsplashing into the stream below. If you look at the glacier in the\r\nFrontispiece, you will see that these stones come from those long\r\nlines of stones and boulders stretching along the sides and centre\r\nof the glacier. It is easy to understand where the stones at the\r\nside come from; for we have seen that damp and frost cause pieces\r\nto break off the surface of the rocks, and it is natural that\r\nthese pieces should roll down the steep sides of the mountains on\r\nto the glacier. But the middle row requires some explanation. Look\r\nto the back of the picture, and you will see that this line of\r\nstones is made of two side rows, which come from the valleys\r\nabove. Two glaciers, you see, have there joined into one, and so\r\nmade a heap of stones all along their line of junction.\r\n\r\nThese stones are being continually, though slowly, conveyed by\r\nthe glacier,  from all the mountains along its sides, down to the\r\nplace where it melts.  Here it lets them fall, and they are\r\ngradually piled up till they form great walls of stone, which\r\nare called moraines. Some of the moraines left by the larger\r\nglaciers of olden time, in the country near Turin, form high\r\nhills,  rising up even to 1500 feet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if ice did no more than carry these stone blocks, it\r\nwould alter the face of the country; but it does much more than\r\nthis. As the glacier moves along, it often cracks for a\r\nconsiderable way across its surface, and this crack widens and\r\nwidens, until at last it becomes a great gaping chasm,  or\r\ncrevasse as it is called, so that you can look down it right to\r\nthe bottom of the glacier. Into these crevasses large blocks of\r\nrock fall, and when the chasm is closed again as the ice presses\r\non, these masses are frozen firmly into the bottom of the\r\nglacier, much in the same way as a steel cutter is fixed in the\r\nbottom of a plane. And they do just the same kind of work; for\r\nas the glacier slides down the valley, they scratch and grind the\r\nrocks underneath them, rubbing themselves away, it is true, but\r\nalso scraping away the ground over which they move. In this way\r\nthe glacier becomes a cutting instrument, and carves out the\r\nvalleys deeper and deeper as it passes through them.\r\n\r\nYou may always know where a glacier has been, even if no trace of\r\nice remains; for you will see rocks with scratches along them\r\nwhich have been cut by these stones; and even where the rocks\r\nhave not been ground away, you will find them rounded like those\r\nin the left-hand of the Frontispiece,  showing that the glacier-\r\nplane has been over them. These rounded rocks are called \"roches\r\nmoutonnees,\" because at the distance they look like sheep lying\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nYou have only to look at the stream flowing from the mouth of a\r\nglacier to see what a quantity of soil it has ground off from\r\nthe bottom of the valley;  for the water is thick, and coloured a\r\ndeep yellow by the mud it carries.  This mud soon reaches the\r\nrivers into which the streams run; and such rivers as the Rhone\r\nand the Rhine are thick with matter brought down from the Alps.\r\nThe Rhone leaves this mud in the Lake of Geneva, flowing out at\r\nthe other end quite clear and pure. A mile and a half of land\r\nhas been formed at the head of the lake since the time of the\r\nRomans by the mud thus brought down from the mountains.\r\n\r\nThus we see that ice, like water, is always busy carving out the\r\nsurface of the earth, and sending down material to make new land\r\nelsewhere. We know that in past ages the glaciers were much\r\nlarger than they are in our time;  for we find traces of them\r\nover large parts of Switzerland where glaciers do not now exist,\r\nand huge blocks which could only have been carried by ice, and\r\nwhich are called \"erratic blocks,\" some of them as big as\r\ncottages, have been left scattered over all the northern part of\r\nEurope. These blocks were a great puzzle to scientific men till,\r\nin 1840, Professor Agassiz showed that they must have been brought\r\nby ice all the way from Norway and Russia.\r\n\r\nIn those ancient days, there were even glaciers in England; for\r\nin Cumberland and in Wales you may see their work, in scratched\r\nand rounded rocks, and the moraines they have left. Llanberis\r\nPass, so famous for its beauty, is covered with ice-scratches,\r\nand blocks are scattered all over the sides of the valley. There\r\nis one block high up on the right-hand slope of the valley, as\r\nyou enter from the Beddgelert side, which is exactly poised upon\r\nanother block, so that it rocks to and fro. It must have been\r\nleft thus balanced when the ice melted round it. You may easily\r\nsee that these blocks were carried by ice, and not by water,\r\nbecause their edges are sharp,  whereas if they had been rolled\r\nin water, they would have been smoothed down.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here go into the history of that great Glacial Period\r\nlong ago,  when large fields of ice covered all the north of\r\nEngland; but when you read it for yourselves and understand the\r\nchanges on the earth's surface which we can see being made by\r\nice now, then such grand scenery as the rugged valleys of Wales,\r\nwith large angular stone blocks scattered over them, will tell\r\nyou a wonderful story of the ice of bygone times.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have touched lightly on the chief ways in which water\r\nand ice carve out the surface of the earth. We have seen that\r\nrain, rivers, springs, the waves of the sea, frost, and glaciers\r\nall do their part in chiselling out ravines and valleys, and in\r\nproducing rugged peaks or undulating plains - here cutting through\r\nrocks so as to form precipitous cliffs, there laying down new land\r\nto add to the flat country - in one place grinding stones to\r\npowder, in others piling them up in gigantic ridges. We cannot go\r\na step into the country without seeing the work of water around\r\nus; every little gully and ravine tells us that the sculpture is\r\ngoing on; every stream, with its burden of visible or invisible\r\nmatter, reminds us that some earth is being taken away and carried\r\nto a new spot. In our little lives we see indeed but the very\r\nsmall changes, but by these we learn how greater ones have been\r\nbrought about, and how we owe the outline of all our beautiful\r\nscenery, with its hills and valleys, its mountains and plains, its\r\ncliffs and caverns, its quiet nooks and its grand rugged\r\nprecipices, to the work of the \"Two great sculptors, Water and\r\nIce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 16\r\n\r\nLecture VI\r\n\r\nTHE VOICES OF NATURE AND HOW WE HEAR THEM\r\n\r\nWe have reached to-day the middle point of our course, and here\r\nwe will make a new start.  All the wonderful histories which we\r\nhave been studying in the last five lectures have had little or\r\nnothing to do with living creatures.  The sunbeams would strike\r\non our earth, the air would move restlessly to and fro, the\r\nwater-drops would rise and fall, the valleys and ravines would\r\nstill be cut out by rivers , if there were no such thing as life\r\nupon the earth.  But without living things there could be none of\r\nthe beauty which these changes bring about.  Without plants, the\r\nsunbeams, the air and the water would be quite unable to clothe\r\nthe bare rocks, and without animals and man they could not\r\nproduce light, or sound, or feeling of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn the next five lectures, however, we are going to learn\r\nsomething of the use living creatures make of the earth; and to-\r\nday we will begin by studying one of the ways in which we are\r\naffected by the changes of nature, and hear her voice.\r\n\r\nWe are all so accustomed to trust to our sight to guide us in\r\nmost of our actions, and to think of things as we see them, that\r\nwe often forget how very much we owe to sound.  And yet Nature\r\nspeaks to us so much by her gentle, her touching, or her awful\r\nsounds, that the life of a deaf person is even more hard to bear\r\nthan that of a blind one.\r\n\r\nHave you ever amused yourself with trying how many different\r\nsounds you can distinguish if you listen at an open window in a\r\nbusy street?  You will probably be able to recognize easily the\r\njolting of the heavy wagon or dray, the rumble of the omnibus,\r\nthe smooth roll of the private carriage and the rattle of the\r\nlight butcher's cart; and even while you are listening for these,\r\nthe crack of the carter's whip, the cry of the costermonger at\r\nhis stall, and the voices of the passers-by will strike upon you\r\near.  Then if you give still more close attention you will hear\r\nthe doors open and shut along the street, the footsteps of the\r\npassengers, the scraping of the shovel of the mud-carts; nay, if\r\nhe happen to stand near, you may even hear the jingling of the\r\nshoeblack's pence as he plays pitch and toss upon the pavement.\r\nIf you think for a moment, does it not seem wonderful that you\r\nshould hear all these sounds so that you can recognize each one\r\ndistinctly while all the rest are going on around you?\r\n\r\nBut suppose you go into the quiet country.  Surely there will be\r\nsilence there.  Try some day and prove it for yourself, lie down\r\non the grass in a sheltered nook and listen attentively.  If\r\nthere be ever so little wind stirring you will hear it rustling\r\ngently through the trees; or even if there is not this, it will\r\nbe strange if you do not hear some wandering gnat buzzing, or\r\nsome busy bee humming as it moves from flower to flower.  Then a\r\ngrasshopper will set up a chirp within a few yards of you, or, if\r\nall living creatures are silent, a brook not far off may be\r\nflowing along with a rippling musical sound.  These and a hundred\r\nother noises you will hear in the most quiet country spot; the\r\nlowing of the cattle, the song of the birds, the squeak of the\r\nfield-mouse, the croak of the frog, mingling with the sound of\r\nthe woodman's axe in the distance, or the dash of some river\r\ntorrent.  And beside these quiet sounds, there are still other\r\noccasional voices of nature which speak to us from time to time.\r\nThe howling of the tempestuous wind, the roar of the sea-waves in\r\na storm, the crash of thunder, and the mighty noise of the\r\nfalling avalanche; such sounds as these tell us how great and\r\nterrible nature can be.\r\n\r\nNow, has it ever occurred to you to think what sounds is, and how\r\nit is that we hear all these things?  Strange as it may seem, if\r\nthere were no creature that could hear upon the earth, there\r\nwould be no such thing as sound, though all these movements in\r\nnature were going on just as they are now.\r\n\r\nTry and grasp this thoroughly, for it is difficult at first to\r\nmake people believe it.  Suppose you were stone-deaf, there would\r\nbe no such thing as sound to you.  A heavy hammer falling on an\r\nanvil would indeed shake the air violently, but since this air\r\nwhen it reached your ear would find a useless instrument, it\r\ncould not play upon it.  and it is this play on the drum of your\r\near and the nerves within it speaking to your brain which make\r\nsound.  Therefore, if all creatures on or around the earth were\r\nwithout ears or nerves of hearing, there would be no instrument\r\non which to play, and consequently there would be no such thing\r\nas sound.  This proves that two things are needed in order that\r\nwe may hear.  First, the outside movement which plays on our\r\nhearing instrument; and, secondly, the hearing instrument itself.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, let us try to understand what happens outside our\r\nears.  Take a poker and tie a piece of string to it, and holding\r\nthe ends of the string to your ears, strike the poker against the\r\nfender.  You will hear a very loud sound, for the blow will set\r\nall the particles of the poker quivering, and this movement will\r\npass right along the string to the drum of your ear and play upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow take the string away from you ears, and hold it with your\r\nteeth.  Stop your ears tight, and strike the poker once more\r\nagainst the fender.  You will hear the sound quite as loudly and\r\nclearly as you did before, but this time the drum of your ear has\r\nnot been agitated.  How, then, has the sound been produced?  In\r\nthis case, the quivering movement has passed through your teeth\r\ninto the bones of your hear, and from them into the nerves, and\r\nso produced sound in your brain.  And now, as a final experiment,\r\nfasten the string to the mantelpiece, and hit it again against\r\nthe fender.  How much feebler the sound is this time, and how\r\nmuch sooner it stops!  Yet still it reaches you, for the movement\r\nhas come this time across the air to the drums of your ear.\r\n\r\nHere we are back again in the land of invisible workers!  We have\r\nall been listening and hearing ever since we were babies, but\r\nhave we ever made any picture to ourselves of how sound comes to\r\nus right across a room or a field, when we stand at one end and\r\nthe person who calls is at the other?\r\n\r\nSince we have studied the \"aerial ocean,\" we know that the air\r\nfilling the space between us, though invisible, is something very\r\nreal, and now all we have to do is to understand exactly how the\r\nmovement crosses this air.\r\n\r\nThis we shall do most readily by means of an experiment made by\r\nDr. Tyndall in his lectures on Sound.  I have here a number of\r\nboxwood balls resting in a wooden tray which has a bell hung at\r\nthe end of it.  I am going to take the end ball and roll it\r\nsharply against the rest, and then I want you to notice carefully\r\nwhat happens.  See! the ball at the other end has flow off and\r\nhit the bell, so that you hear it ring.  Yet the other balls\r\nremain where they were before.  Why is this?  It is because each\r\nof the balls, as it was knocked forwards, had one in front of it\r\nto stop it and make it bound back again, but the last one was\r\nfree to move on.  When I threw this ball from my hand against the\r\nothers, the one in front of it moved, and hitting the third ball,\r\nbounded back again; the third did the same to the fourth, the\r\nfourth to the fifth, and so on to the end of the line.  Each ball\r\nthus came back to its place, but it passed the shock on to the\r\nlast ball, and the ball to the bell.  If I now put the balls\r\nclose up to the bell, and repeat the experiment, you still hear\r\nthe sound, for the last ball shakes the bell as if it were a ball\r\nin front of it.\r\n\r\nNow imagine these balls to be atoms of air, and the bell your\r\near.  If I clap my hands and so hit the air in front of them,\r\neach air-atom hits the next just as the balls did, and though it\r\ncomes back to its place, it passes the shock on along the whole\r\nline to the atom touching the drum of your ear, and so you\r\nreceive a blow.  But a curious thing happens in the air which you\r\ncannot notice in the balls.  You must remember that air is\r\nelastic, just as if there were springs between the atoms as in\r\nthe diagram, Fig. 31, and so when any shock knocks the atoms\r\nforward, several of them can be crowded together before they push\r\non those in front.  Then, as soon as they have passed the shock\r\non, they rebound and begin to separate again, and so swing to and\r\nfro till they come to rest.  meanwhile the second set will go\r\nthrough just the same movements, and will spring apart as soon as\r\nthey have passed the shock on to a third set, and so you will\r\nhave one set of crowded atoms and one set of separated atoms\r\nalternately all along the line, and the same set will never be\r\ncrowded two instants together.\r\n\r\nYou may see an excellent example of this in a luggage train in a\r\nrailway station, when the trucks are left to bump each other till\r\nthey stop.  You will see three or four trucks knock together,\r\nthen they will pass the shock on to the four in front, while they\r\nthemselves bound back and separate as far as their chains will\r\nlet them: the next four trucks will do the same, and so a kind of\r\nwave of crowded trucks passes on to the end of the train, and\r\nthey bump to and fro till the whole comes to a standstill.  Try\r\nto imagine a movement like this going on in the line of air-\r\natoms, the drum of your ear being at the end.  Those which are\r\ncrowded together at that end will hit on the drum of your ear and\r\ndrive the membrane which covers it inwards; then instantly the\r\nwave will change, these atoms will bound back, and the membrane\r\nwill recover itself again, but only to receive a second blow as\r\nthe atoms are driven forwards again, and so the membrane will be\r\ndriven in and out till the air has settled down.\r\n\r\nThis you see is quite different to the waves of light which moves\r\nin crests and hollows.  Indeed, it is not what we usually\r\nunderstand by a wave at all, but a set of crowdings and partings\r\nof atoms of air which follow each other rapidly across the air.\r\nA crowding of atoms is called a condensation, and a parting is\r\ncalled a rarefaction, and when we speak of the length of a wave\r\nof sound, we mean the distance between two condensations, or\r\nbetween two rarefactions.\r\n\r\nAlthough each atom of air moves a very little way forwards and\r\nthen back, yet, as a long row of atoms may be crowded together\r\nbefore they begin to part, a wave is often very long.  When a man\r\ntalks in an ordinary bass voice, he makes sound-waves from 8 to\r\n12 feet long; a woman's voice makes shorter waves, from 2 to 4\r\nfeet long, and consequently the tone is higher, as we shall\r\npresently explain.\r\n\r\nAnd now I hope that some one is anxious to ask why, when I clap\r\nmy hands, anyone behind me or at the side, can hear it as well or\r\nnearly as well as you who are in front.  This is because I give a\r\nshock to the air all round my hands, and waves go out on all\r\nsides, making as it were gloves of crowdings and partings\r\nwidening and widening away from the clap as circles widen on a\r\npond.  Thus the waves travel behind me, above me, and on all\r\nsides, until they hit the walls, the ceiling, and the floor of\r\nthe room, and wherever you happen to be, they hit upon your ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 17\r\n\r\nIf you can picture to yourself these waves spreading out in all\r\ndirections, you will easily see why sound grows fainter at the\r\ndistance.  Just close round my hands when I clap them, there is\r\na small quantity of air, and so the shock I give it is very\r\nviolent, but as the sound-waves spread on all sides they have\r\nmore and more air to move, and so the air-atoms are shaken less\r\nviolently and strike with less force on your ear.\r\n\r\nIf we can prevent the sound-wave from spreading, then the sound\r\nis not weakened. The Frenchman Biot found that a low whisper\r\ncould be heard distinctly for a distance of half a mile through a\r\ntube, because the waves could not spread beyond the small column\r\nof air.  But unless you speak into a small space of some kind,\r\nyou cannot prevent the waves going out from you in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nTry and imagine that you see these waves spreading all round me\r\nnow and hitting on your ears as they pass, then on the ears of\r\nthose behind you, and on and on in widening globes till they\r\nreach the wall.  What will happen when they get there?  If the\r\nwall were thin, as a wooden partition is, they would shake it,\r\nand it again would shake the air on the other side, and so anyone\r\nin the next room would have the sound of my voice brought to\r\ntheir ear.\r\n\r\nBut something more will happen.  In any case the sound-waves\r\nhitting against the wall will bound back from it just as a ball\r\nbounds back when thrown against anything, and so another set of\r\nsound-waves reflected from the wall will come back across the\r\nroom.  If these waves come to your ear so quickly that they mix\r\nwith direct waves, they help to make the sound louder in this\r\nroom than you would in the open air, for the \"Ha\" from my mouth\r\nand a second \"Ha\" from the wall come to your ear so\r\ninstantaneously that they make one sound.  This is why you can\r\noften hear better at the far end of a church when you stand\r\nagainst a screen or a wall, then when you are half-way up the\r\nbuilding nearer to the speaker, because near the wall the\r\nreflected waves strike strongly on your ear and make the sound\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the sound comes from a great explosion, these\r\nreflected waves are so strong that they are able to break glass.\r\nIn the explosion of gunpowder in St. John's Wood, many houses in\r\nthe back streets had their windows broken; for the sound-waves\r\nbounded off at angles from the walls and struck back upon them.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the wall were so far behind you that the reflected\r\nsound-waves only hit upon your ear after those coming straight\r\nfrom me had died away; then you would hear the sound twice, \"Ha\"\r\nfrom me and \"Ha\" from the wall, and here you have an echo, \"Ha,\r\nha.\"  In order for this to happen in ordinary air, you must be\r\nstanding at least 56 feet away from the point from which the\r\nwaves are reflected, for then the second blow will come one-tenth\r\nof a second after the first one, and that is long enough for you\r\nto feel them separately.*  Miss C. A. Martineau tells a story of\r\na dog which was terribly frightened by an echo.  Thinking another\r\ndog was barking, he ran forward to meet him, and was very much\r\nastonished, when, as he came nearer the wall, the echo ceased.  I\r\nmyself once knew a case of this kind, and my dog, when he could\r\nfind no enemy, ran back barking, till he was a certain distance\r\noff, and then the echo of course began again.  He grew so furious\r\nat last that we had great difficulty in preventing him from\r\nflying at a strange man who happened to be passing at the time.\r\n(*Sound travels 1120 feet in a second, in air of ordinary\r\ntemperature, and therefore 112 feet in the tenth of a second.\r\nTherefore the journey of 56 feet beyond you to reach the wall\r\nand 56 feet to return, will occupy the sound-wave one-tenth of\r\na second and separate the two sounds.)\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the mountains, walls of rock rise at some distance\r\none behind another, and then each one will send back its echo a\r\nlittle later than the rock before it, so that the \"Ha\" which you\r\ngive will come back as a peal of laughter.  There is an echo in\r\nWoodstock Park which repeats the word twenty times.  Again\r\nsometimes, as in the Alps, the sound-waves coming back rebound\r\nfrom mountain to mountain and are driven backwards and forwards,\r\nbecoming fainter and fainter till they die away; these echoes are\r\nvery beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf you are now able to picture to yourselves one set of waves\r\ngoing to the wall, and another set returning and crossing them,\r\nyou will be ready to understand something of that very difficult\r\nquestion, How is it that we can hear many different sounds at one\r\ntime and tell them apart?\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched the sea when its surface is much ruffled,\r\nand noticed how, besides the big waves of the tide, there are\r\nnumberless smaller ripples made by the wind blowing the surface\r\nof the water, or the oars of a boat dipping in it, or even rain-\r\ndrops falling?  If you have done this you will have seen that all\r\nthese waves and ripples cross each other, and you can follow any\r\none ripple with you eye as it goes on its way undisturbed by the\r\nrest.  Or you may make beautiful crossing and recrossing ripples\r\non a pond by throwing in two stones at a little distance from\r\neach other, and here too you can follow any one wave on to the\r\nedge of the pond.\r\n\r\nNow just in this way the waves of sound, in their manner of\r\nmoving, cross and recross each other.  You will remember too,\r\nthat different sounds make waves of different lengths, just as\r\nthe tide makes a long wave and the rain-drops tiny ones.\r\nTherefore each sound falls with its own peculiar wave upon your\r\near, and you can listen to that particular wave just as you look\r\nat one particular ripple, and then the sound becomes clear to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAll this is what is going on outside your ear, but what is\r\nhappening in your ear itself?  How do these blows of the air\r\nspeak to your brain?  By means of the following diagram, Fig. 33,\r\nwe will try to understand roughly our beautiful hearing\r\ninstrument, the ear.\r\n\r\nFirst, I want you to notice how beautifully the outside shell, or\r\nconcha as it is called, is curbed round so that any movement of\r\nthe air coming to it from the front is caught in it and reflected\r\ninto the hole of the ear.  Put your finger round your ear and\r\nfeel how the gristly part is curved towards the front of your\r\nhead.  This concha makes a curve much like the curve a deaf man\r\nmakes with his hand behind his ear to catch the sound.  Animals\r\noften have to raise their ears to catch the sound well, but ours\r\nstand always ready.  When the air-waves have passed in at the\r\nhole of your ear, they move all the air in the passage, which is\r\ncalled the auditory, or hearing, canal.  This canal is lined with\r\nlittle hairs to keep out insects and dust, and the wax which\r\ncollects in it serves the same purpose.  But is too much wax\r\ncollects, it prevents the air from playing well upon the drum,\r\nand therefore makes you deaf.  Across the end of this canal, a\r\nmembrane or skin called the tympanum is stretched, like the\r\nparchment over the head of a drum, and it is this membrane which\r\nmoves to and fro as the air-waves strike on it.  A violent box on\r\nthe ear will sometimes break this delicate membrane, or injure\r\nit, and therefore it is very wrong to hit a person violently on\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of this membrane, inside the ear, there is air,\r\nwhich fills the whole of the inner chamber and the tube, which\r\nruns down into the throat behind the nose, and is called the\r\nEustachian tube after the man who discovered it.  This tube is\r\nclosed at the end by a valve which opens and shuts.  If you\r\nbreathe out strongly, and then shut your mouth and swallow, you\r\nwill hear a little \"click\" in your ear.  This is because in\r\nswallowing you draw the air out of the Eustachian tube and so\r\ndraw in the membrane, which clicks as it goes back again.  But\r\nunless you do this the tube and the whole chamber cavity behind\r\nthe membrane remains full of air.\r\n\r\nNow, as this membrane is driven to and fro by the sound-waves, it\r\nnaturally shakes the air in the cavity behind it, and it also\r\nsets moving three most curious little bones.  The first of the\r\nbones is fastened to the middle of the drumhead so that it moves\r\nto and fro every time this membrane quivers.  The head of this\r\nbone fits into a hole in the next bone, the anvil, and is\r\nfastened to it by muscles, so as to drag it along with it; but,\r\nthe muscles being elastic, it can draw back a little from the\r\nanvil, and so give it a blow each time it comes back.  This anvil\r\nis in its turn very firmly fixed to the little bone, shaped like\r\na stirrup, which you see at the end of the chain.\r\n\r\nThis stirrup rests upon a curious body which looks in the diagram\r\nlike a snail-shell with tubes coming out of it.  This body, which\r\nis called the labyrinth, is made of bone, but it has two little\r\nwindows in it, one covered only by a membrane, while the other\r\nhas the head of the stirrup resting upon it.\r\n\r\nNow, with a little attention you will understand that when the\r\nair in the canal shakes the drumhead to and fro, this membrane\r\nmust drag with it the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup.  Each\r\ntime the drum goes in, the hammer will hit the anvil, and drive\r\nthe stirrup against the little window; every time it goes out it\r\nwill draw the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup out again, ready\r\nfor another blow.  Thus the stirrup is always playing upon this\r\nlittle window.  Meanwhile, inside the bony labyrinth there is a\r\nfluid like water, and along the little passages are very fine\r\nhairs, which wave to and fro like reeds; and whenever the stirrup\r\nhits at the little window, the fluid moves these hairs to and\r\nfro, and they irritate the ends of a nerve, and this nerve\r\ncarries the message to your brain.  There are also some curious\r\nlittle stones called otoliths, lying in some parts of this fluid,\r\nand they, by their rolling to and fro, probably keep up the\r\nmotion and prolong the sound.\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine we have explained here the many intricacies\r\nwhich occur in the ear; I can only hope to give you a rough idea\r\nof it, so that you may picture to yourselves the air-waves moving\r\nbackwards and forward in the canal of your ear, then the tympanum\r\nvibrating to and fro, the hammer hitting the anvil, the stirrup\r\nknocking at the little window, the fluid waving the fine hairs\r\nand rolling the tiny stones, the ends of the nerve quivering, and\r\nthen (how we know not) the brain hearing the message.\r\n\r\nIs not this wonderful, going on as it does at every sound you\r\nhear?  And yet his is not all, for inside that curled part of the\r\nlabyrinth, which looks like a snail-shell and is called the\r\ncochlea, there is a most wonderful apparatus of more than three\r\nthousand fine stretched filaments or threads, and these act like\r\nthe strings of a harp, and make you hear different tones.  If you\r\ngo near to a harp or a piano, and sing any particular note very\r\nloudly, you will hear this note sounding in the instrument,\r\nbecause you will set just that particular string quivering, which\r\ngives the note you sang.  The air-waves set going by your voice\r\ntouch that string, because it can quiver in time with them, while\r\nnone of the other strings can do so.  Now, just in the same way\r\nthe tiny instrument of three thousand strings in your ear, which\r\nis called Corti's organ, vibrates to the air-waves, one thread to\r\none set of waves, and another to another, and according to the\r\nfibre that quivers, will be the sound you hear.  Here then at\r\nlast, we see how nature speaks to us.  All the movements going on\r\noutside, however violent and varied they may be, cannot of\r\nthemselves make sound.  But here, in the little space behind the\r\ndrum of our ear, the air-waves are sorted and sent on to our\r\nbrain, where they speak to us as sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 18\r\n\r\nBut why then do we not hear all sounds as music?  Why are some\r\nmere noise, and others clear musical notes?  This depends\r\nentirely upon whether the sound-waves come quickly and regularly,\r\nor by an irregular succession of shocks.  For example, when a\r\nload of stones is being shot out of a cart, you hear only a long,\r\ncontinuous noise, because the stones fall irregularly, some\r\nquicker, some slower, here a number together, and there two or\r\nthree stragglers by themselves; each of these different shocks\r\ncomes to your ear and makes a confused, noisy sound.  But if you\r\nrun a stick very quickly along a paling, you will hear a sound\r\nvery like a musical not.  This is because the rods of the paling\r\nare all at equal distances one from another, and so the shocks\r\nfall quickly one after another at regular intervals upon your\r\near.  Any quick and regular succession of sounds makes a note,\r\neven though it may be an ugly one.  The squeak of a slate pencil\r\nalong a slate, and the shriek of a railway whistle are not\r\npleasant, but they are real notes which you could copy on a\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\nI have here a simple apparatus which I have had made to show you\r\nthat rapid and regular shocks produce a natural musical note.\r\nThis wheel (Fig. 34) is milled at the edge like a shilling, and\r\nwhen I turn it rapidly so that it strikes against the edge of the\r\ncard fixed behind it, the notches strike in rapid succession, and\r\nproduce a musical sound.  We can also prove by this experiment\r\nthat the quicker the blows are, the higher the note will be.  I\r\npull the string gently at first, and then quicker and quicker,\r\nand you will notice that the note grows sharper and sharper, till\r\nthe movement begins to slacken, when the note goes down again.\r\nThis is because the more rapidly the air is hit, the shorter are\r\nthe waves it makes, and short waves give a high note.\r\n\r\nLet us examine this with two tuning-forks.  I strike one, and it\r\nsounds D, the third space in the treble; I strike the other, and\r\nit sounds G, the first leger line, five notes above the C.  I\r\nhave drawn on this diagram (Fig. 35), an imaginary picture of\r\nthese two sets of waves.  You see that the G fork makes three\r\nwaves, while the C fork makes only two.  Why is this?  Because\r\nthe prong of the G fork moves three times backwards and forwards\r\nwhile the prong of the C fork only moves twice; therefore the G\r\nfork does not crowd so many atoms together before it draws back,\r\nand the waves are shorter.  These two notes, C and G, are a fifth\r\nof an octave apart; if we had two forks, of which one went twice\r\nas fast as the other, making four waves while the other made two,\r\nthen that note would be an octave higher.\r\n\r\nSo we see that all the sounds we hear, - the warning noises which\r\nkeep us from harm, the beautiful musical notes with all the tunes\r\nand harmonies that delight us, even the power of hearing the\r\nvoices of those we love, and learning from one another that which\r\neach can tell, - all these depend upon the invisible waves of\r\nair, even as the pleasures of light depend on the waves of ether.\r\nIt is by these sound-waves that nature speaks to us, and in all\r\nher movements there is a reason why her boice is sharp or tender,\r\nloud or gentle, awful or loving.  Take for instance the brook we\r\nspoke of at the beginning of the lecture.  Why does it sing so\r\nsweetly, while the wide deep river makes no noise?  Because the\r\nlittle brook eddies and purls round the stones, hitting them as\r\nit passes; sometimes the water falls down a large stone, and\r\nstrikes against the water below; or sometimes it grates the\r\nlittle pebbles together as they lie in its bed.  Each of these\r\nblows makes a small globe of sound-waves, which spread and spread\r\ntill they fall on your ear, and because they fall quickly and\r\nregularly, they make a low, musical note.  We might almost fancy\r\nthat the brook wished to show how joyfully it flows along,\r\nrecalling Shelley's beautiful lines:-\r\n\r\n \"Sometimes it fell\r\n  Among the moss with hollow harmony,\r\n  Dark and profound; now on the polished stones\r\n  It danced; like childhood laughing as it went.\"\r\n\r\nThe broad deep river, on the contrary, makes none of these\r\ncascades and commotions.  The only places against which it rubs\r\nare the banks and the bottom; and here you can sometimes hear it\r\ngrating the particles of sand against each other if you listen\r\nvery carefully.  But there is another reason why falling water\r\nmakes a sound, and often even a loud roaring noise in the\r\ncataract and in the breaking waves of the sea.  You do not only\r\nhear the water dashing against the rocky ledges or on the beach,\r\nyou also hear the bursting of innumerable little bladders of air\r\nwhich are contained in the water.  As each of these bladders is\r\ndashed on the ground, it explodes and sends sound-waves to your\r\near.  Listen to the sea some day when the waves are high and\r\nstormy, and you cannot fail to be struck by the irregular bursts\r\nof sound.\r\n\r\nThe waves, however, do not only roar as they dash on the ground;\r\nhave you never noticed how they seem to scream as they draw back\r\ndown the beach?  Tennyson calls it,\r\n\r\n\"The scream of the madden'd beach dragged down by the wave;\" and\r\nit is caused by the stones grating against each other as the\r\nwaves drag them down.  Dr. Tyndall tells us that it is possible\r\nto know the size of the stones by the kind of noise they make.\r\nIf they are large, it is a confused noise, when smaller, a kind\r\nof scream; while a gravelly beach will produce a mere hiss.\r\n\r\nWho could be dull by the side of a brook, a waterfall, or the\r\nsea, while he can listen for sounds like these, and picture to\r\nhimself how they are being made?  You may discover a number of\r\nother causes of sound made by water, if you once pay attention to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNor is it only water that sings to us.  Listen to the wind, how\r\nsweetly it sighs among the leaves.  There we hear it, because it\r\nrubs the leaves together, and they produce the sound-waves.  But\r\nwalk against the wind some day and you can hear it whistling in\r\nyour own ear, striking against the curved cup, and then setting\r\nup a succession of waves in the hearing canal of the ear itself.\r\n\r\nWhy should it sound in one particular tone when all kinds of\r\nsound-waves must be surging about in the disturbed air?\r\n\r\nThis glass jar will answer our question roughly.  If I strike my\r\ntuning-fork and hold it over the jar, you cannot hear it, because\r\nthe sound is feeble, but if I fill the jar gently with water,\r\nwhen the water rises to a certain point you will hear a loud\r\nclear note, because the waves of air in the jar are exactly the\r\nright length to answer to the note of the fork.  If I now blow\r\nacross the mouth of the jar you hear the same note, showing that\r\na cavity of a particular length will only sound to the waves\r\nwhich fit it.  do you see now the reason why pan-pipes give\r\ndifferent sounds, or even the hole at the end of a common key\r\nwhen you blow across it?  Here is a subject you will find very\r\ninteresting if you will read about it, for I can only just\r\nsuggest it to you here.  But now you will see that the canal of\r\nyour ear also answers only to certain waves, and so the wind\r\nsings in your ear with a real if not a musical note.\r\n\r\nAgain, on a windy night have you not heard the wind sounding a\r\nwild, sad note down a valley?  Why do you think it sounds so much\r\nlouder and more musical here than when it is blowing across the\r\nplain?  Because air in the valley will only answer to a certain\r\nset of waves, and, like the pan-pipe, gives a particular note as\r\nthe wind blows across it, and these waves go up and down the\r\nvalley in regular pulses, making a wild howl.  You may hear the\r\nsame in the chimney, or in the keyhole; all these are waves set\r\nup in the hole across which the wind blows.  Even the music in\r\nthe shell which you hold to your ear is made by the air in the\r\nshell pulsating to and fro.  And how do you think it is set\r\ngoing?  By the throbbing of the veins in your own ear, which\r\ncauses the air in the shell to vibrate.\r\n\r\nAnother grand voice of nature is the thunder.  People often have\r\na vague idea that thunder is produced by the clouds knocking\r\ntogether, which is very absurd, if you remember that clouds are\r\nbut water-dust.  The most probable explanation of thunder is much\r\nmore beautiful than this.  You will remember from Lecture III\r\nthat heat forces the air-atoms apart.  Now, when a flash of\r\nlightning crosses the sky it suddenly expands the air all round\r\nit as it passes, so that globe after globe of sound-waves is\r\nformed at every point across which the lightning travels.  Now\r\nlight, you remember, travels so wonderfully rapidly (192,000\r\nmiles in a second) that a flash of lightning is seen by us and is\r\nover in a second, even when it is two or three miles long.  But\r\nsound comes slowly, taking five seconds to travel half a mile,\r\nand so all the sound-waves at each point of the two or three\r\nmiles fall on our ear one after the other, and make the rolling\r\nthunder.  Sometimes the roll is made even longer by the echo, as\r\nthe sound-waves are reflected to and fro by the clouds on their\r\nroad; and in the mountains we know how the peals echo and re-echo\r\ntill they die away.\r\n\r\nWe might fill up far more than an hour in speaking of those\r\nvoices which come to us as nature is at work.  Think of the\r\npatter of the rain, how each drop as it hits the pavement sends\r\ncircles of sound-waves out on all sides; or the loud report which\r\nfalls on the ear of the Alpine traveller as the glacier cracks on\r\nits way down the valley; or the mighty boom of the avalanche as\r\nthe snow slides in huge masses off the side of the lofty\r\nmountain.  Each and all of these create their sound-waves, large\r\nor small, loud or feeble, which make their way to your ear, and\r\nbecome converted into sound.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, only time now just to glance at life-sounds, of\r\nwhich there are so many around us.  Do you know why we hear a\r\nbuzzing, as the gnat, the bee, or the cockchafer fly past?  Not\r\nby the beating of their wings against the air, as many people\r\nimagine, and as is really the case with humming birds, but by the\r\nscraping of the under-part of their hard wings against the edges\r\nof their hind legs, which are toothed like a saw.  The more\r\nrapidly their wings move the stronger the grating sound becomes,\r\nand you will now see why in hot, thirsty weather the buzzing of\r\nthe gnat is so loud, for the more thirsty and the more eager he\r\nbecomes, the wilder his movements will be.\r\n\r\nSome insects, like the drone-fly (Eristalis tenax), force the air\r\nthrough the tiny air-passages in their sides, and as these\r\npassages are closed by little plates, the plates vibrate to and\r\nfro and make sound-waves.  Again, what are those curious sounds\r\nyou may hear sometimes if you rest your head on a trunk in the\r\nforest?  They are made by the timber-boring beetles, which saw\r\nthe wood with their jaws and make a noise in the world, even\r\nthough they have no voice.\r\n\r\nAll these life-sounds are made by creatures which do not sing or\r\nspeak; but the sweetest sounds of all in the woods are the voices\r\nof the birds.  All voice-sounds are made by two elastic bands or\r\ncushions, called vocal chords, stretched across the end of the\r\ntube or windpipe through which we breathe, and as we send the air\r\nthrough them we tighten or loosen them as we will, and so make\r\nthem vibrate quickly or slowly and make sound-waves of different\r\nlengths.  But if you will try some day in the woods you will find\r\nthat a bird can beat you over and over again in the length of his\r\nnote; when you are out of breath and forced to stop he will go on\r\nwith his merry trill as fresh and clear as if he had only just\r\nbegun.  This is because birds can draw air into the whole of\r\ntheir body, and they have a large stock laid up in the folds of\r\ntheir windpipe, and besides this the air-chamber behind their\r\nelastic bands or vocal chords has two compartments where we have\r\nonly one, and the second compartment has special muscles by which\r\nthey can open and shut it, and so prolong the trill.\r\n\r\nOnly think what a rapid succession of waves must quiver through\r\nthe air as a tiny lark agitates his little throat and pours forth\r\na volume of song!  The next time you are in the country in the\r\nspring, spend half an hour listening to him, and try and picture\r\nto yourself how that little being is moving all the atmosphere\r\nround him.  Then dream for a little while about sound, what it\r\nis, how marvellously it works outside in the world, and inside in\r\nyour ear and brain; and then, when you go back to work again, you\r\nwill hardly deny that it is well worth while to listen sometimes\r\nto the voices of nature and ponder how it is that we hear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 19\r\n\r\nLECTURE VII THE LIFE OF A PRIMROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the dreary days of winter and the early damp days of spring\r\nare passing away, and the warm bright sunshine has begun to pour\r\ndown upon the grassy paths of the wood, who does not love to go\r\nout and bring home posies of violets, and bluebells, and\r\nprimroses? We wander from one plant to another picking a flower\r\nhere and a bud there, as they nestle among the green\r\nleaves, and we make our rooms sweet and gay with the tender and\r\nlovely blossoms. But tell me, did you ever stop to think, as you\r\nadded flower after flower to your nosegay, how the plants which\r\nbear them have been building up their green leaves and their\r\nfragile buds during the last few weeks? If you had visited the\r\nsame spot a month before, a few (of) last year's leaves,\r\nwithered and dead, would have been all that you would have found.\r\nAnd now the whole wood is carpeted with delicate green leaves,\r\nwith nodding bluebells, and pale-yellow primroses, as if a fairy\r\nhad touched the ground and covered it with fresh young life. And\r\nour fairies have been at work here; the fairy \"Life,\" of whom we\r\nknow so little, though we love her so well and rejoice in the\r\nbeautiful forms she can produce; the fairy sunbeams with their\r\ninvisible influence kissing the tiny shoots and warming them into\r\nvigour and activity; the gentle rain-drops, the balmy air, all\r\nthese have been working, while you or I passed heedlessly by;\r\nand now we come and gather the flowers they have made, and too\r\noften forget to wonder how these lovely forms have sprung up\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nOur work during the next hour will be to consider this question.\r\nYou were asked last week to bring with you to-day a primrose-\r\nflower, or a whole plant if possible, in order the better to\r\nfollow out with me the \"Life of a Primrose.\" (To enjoy this\r\nlecture, the reader ought to have, if possible, a primrose-\r\nflower, an almond soaked for a few minutes in hot water, and a\r\npiece of orange.) This is a very different kind of subject from\r\nthose of our former lectures. There we took world-\r\nwide histories; we travelled up to the sun, or round the earth,\r\nor into the air; now I only ask you to fix your attention on one\r\nlittle plant, and inquire into its history.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful little poem by Tennyson, which says -\r\n\r\n \"Flower in the crannied wall,\r\n  I pluck you out of the crannies;\r\n  Hold you here, root and all, in my hand,\r\n  Little flower; but if I could understand\r\n  What you are, root and all, and all in all,\r\n  I should know what God and man is.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot learn all about this little flower, but we can learn\r\nenough to understand that it has a real separate life of its\r\nown, well worth knowing.  For a plant is born, breathes, sleeps,\r\nfeeds, and digests just as truly as an animal does, though in a\r\ndifferent way. It works hard both for itself to get its food,\r\nand for others in making the air pure and fit for animals to\r\nbreathe. It often lays by provision for the winter. It sends\r\nyoung plants out, as parents send their children, to fight for\r\nthemselves in the world;  and then, after living sometimes to a\r\ngood old age, it dies, and leaves its place to others.\r\n\r\nWe will try to follow out something of this life to-day; and\r\nfirst, we will begin with the seed.\r\n\r\nI have here a packet of primrose-seeds, but they are so small\r\nthat we cannot examine them; so I have also had given to each\r\none of you an almond-kernel, which is the seed of the almond-\r\ntree, and which has been soaked, so that it splits in half\r\neasily. From this we can learn about seeds in general, and then\r\napply it to the primrose.\r\n\r\nIf you peel the two skins off your almond-seed (the\r\nthick,  brown, outside skin, and the thin, transparent one under\r\nit), the two halves of the almond will slip apart quite easily.\r\nOne of these halves will have a small dent at the pointed end,\r\nwhile in the other half you will see a little lump, which fitted\r\ninto the dent when the two halves were joined. This little lump\r\n(a b, Fig. 37) is a young plant, and the two halves of the\r\nalmond are the seed leaves which hold the plantlet, and feed it\r\ntill it can feed itself. The rounded end of the plantlet (b)\r\nsticking out of the almond,  is the beginning of the root, while\r\nthe other end (a) will in time become the stem. If you look\r\ncarefully, you will see two little points at this end,  which are\r\nthe tips of future leaves. Only think how minute this plantlet\r\nmust be in a primrose, where the whole seed is scarcely larger\r\nthan a grain of sand! Yet in this tiny plantlet lies hid the\r\nlife of the future plant.\r\n\r\nWhen a seed falls into the ground, so long as the earth is cold\r\nand dry, it lies like a person in a trance, as if it were dead;\r\nbut as soon as the warm,  damp spring comes, and the busy little\r\nsun-waves pierce down into the earth,  they wake up the plantlet\r\nand make it bestir itself. They agitate to and fro the particles\r\nof matter in this tiny body, and cause them to seek out for\r\nother particles to seize and join to themselves.\r\n\r\nBut these new particles cannot come in at the roots,\r\nfor the seed has none; nor through the leaves, for they have not\r\nyet grown up; and so the plantlet begins by helping itself to\r\nthe store of food laid up in the thick seed-leaves in which it\r\nis buried. Here it finds starch, oils, sugar,  and substances\r\ncalled albuminoids, -- the sticky matter which you notice in\r\nwheat-grains when you chew them is one of the albuminoids. This\r\nfood is all ready for the plantlet to use, and it sucks it in,\r\nand works itself into a young plant with tiny roots at one end,\r\nand a growing shoot, with leaves, at the other.\r\n\r\nBut how does it grow? What makes it become larger? To answer this\r\nyou must look at the second thing I asked you to bring - a piece\r\nof orange. If you take the skin off a piece of orange, you will\r\nsee inside a number of long-shaped transparent bags, full of\r\njuice. These we call cells, and the flesh of all plants and\r\nanimals is made up of cells like these, only of various shapes.\r\nIn the pith of elder they are round, large, and easily seen (a,\r\nFig. 39); in the stalks of plants they are long, and lap over\r\neach other (b, Fig. 39), so as to give the stalk strength to\r\nstand upright. Sometimes many cells growing one on the top of\r\nthe other break into one tube and make vessels. But whether\r\nlarge or small, they are all bags growing one against the other.\r\n\r\nIn the orange-pulp these cells contain only sweet juice, but in\r\nother parts of the orange-tree or any other plant\r\nthey contain a sticky substance with little grains in it. This\r\nsubstance is called \"protoplasm,\"  or the first form of life, for\r\nit is alive and active, and under a microscope you may see in a\r\nliving plant streams of the little grains moving about in the\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nNow we are prepared to explain how our plant grows. Imagine the\r\ntiny primrose plantlet to be made up of cells filled with active\r\nliving protoplasm, which drinks in starch and other food from\r\nthe seed-leaves. In this way each cell will grow too full for\r\nits skin, and then the protoplasm divides into two parts and\r\nbuilds up a wall between them, and so one cell becomes two. Each\r\nof these two cells again breaks up into two more, and so the\r\nplant grows larger and larger, till by the time it has used up\r\nall the food in the seed-leaves, it has sent roots covered with\r\nfine hairs downwards into the earth, and a shoot with beginnings\r\nof leaves up into the air.\r\n\r\nSometimes the seed-leaves themselves come above the ground, as in\r\nthe mustard-plant, and sometimes they are left empty behind,\r\nwhile the plantlet shoots through them.\r\n\r\nAnd now the plant can no longer afford to be idle and\r\nlive on prepared food. It must work for itself. Until now it has\r\nbeen taking in the same kind of food that you and I do; for we\r\ntoo find many seeds very pleasant to eat and useful to nourish\r\nus. But now this store is exhausted.  Upon what then is the plant\r\nto live? It is cleverer than we are in this, for while we cannot\r\nlive unless we have food which has once been alive, plants can\r\nfeed upon gases and water and mineral matter only. Think over the\r\nsubstances you can eat or drink, and you will find they are\r\nnearly all made of things which have been alive: meat,\r\nvegetables, bread, beer, wine, milk;  all these are made from\r\nliving matter, and though you do take in such things as water\r\nand salt, and even iron and phosphorus, these would be quite\r\nuseless if you did not eat and drink prepared food which your\r\nbody can work into living matter.\r\n\r\nBut the plant as soon as it has roots and leaves begins to make\r\nliving matter out of matter that has never been alive. Through\r\nall the little hairs of its roots it sucks in water, and in this\r\nwater are dissolved more or less of the salts of ammonia,\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, iron, lime, magnesia, and even silica, or\r\nflint. In all kinds of earth there is some iron, and we shall see\r\npresently that this is very important to the plant.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, that our primrose has begun to drink in water at\r\nits roots.  How is it to get this water up into the stem and\r\nleaves, seeing that the whole plant is made of closed bags or\r\ncells? It does it in a very curious way, which you can prove for\r\nyourselves. Whenever two fluids, one thicker than the other,\r\nsuch as treacle and water for example, are only separated by a\r\nskin or any porous substance, they will always mix, the thinner\r\none oozing through the skin into the thicker one. If you tie a\r\npiece of bladder over a glass tube, fill the tube half-full of\r\ntreacle, and then let the covered end rest in a bottle of water,\r\nin a few hours the water will get in to the treacle and the\r\nmixture will rise up in the tube till it flows over the top. Now,\r\nthe saps and juices of plants are thicker than water, so, directly\r\nthe water enters the cells at the root it oozes up into the cells\r\nabove, and mixes with the sap. Then the matter in those cells\r\nbecomes thinner than in the cells above, so it too oozes up, and\r\nin this way cell by cell the water is pumped up into the leaves.\r\n\r\nWhen it gets there it finds our old friends the sun-beams hard at\r\nwork. If you have ever tried to grow a plant in a cellar, you\r\nwill know that in the dark its leaves remain white and sickly.\r\nIt is only in the sunlight that a beautiful delicate green tint\r\nis given to them, and you will remember from Lecture II. that\r\nthis green tint shows that the leaf has used all the sun-waves\r\nexcept those which make you see green; but why should it do this\r\nonly when it has grown up in the sunshine?\r\n\r\nThe reason is this: when the sunbeam darts into the leaf and sets\r\nall its particles quivering, it divides the protoplasm into two\r\nkinds, collected into different cells. One of these remains\r\nwhite, but the other kind, near the surface, is altered by the\r\nsunlight and by the help of the iron brought in by the water.\r\nThis particular kind of protoplasm, which is called \"chlorophyll,\"\r\nwill have nothing to do with the green waves and throws them back,\r\nso that every little grain of this protoplasm looks green and\r\ngives the leaf its green colour.\r\n\r\nIt is these little green cells that by the help of the sun-waves\r\ndigest the food of the plant and turn the water and gases into\r\nuseful sap and juices.  We saw in Lecture III. that when we\r\nbreathe-in air, we use up the oxygen in it and send back out of\r\nour mouths carbonic acid, which is a gas made of oxygen and\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\nNow, every living things wants carbon to feed upon, but plants\r\ncannot take it in by itself, because carbon is solid (the\r\nblacklead in your pencils is pure carbon), and a plant cannot\r\neat, it can only drink-in fluids and gases.  Here the little\r\ngreen cells help it out of its difficulty. They take in or\r\nabsorb out of the air carbonic acid gas which we have given out\r\nof our mouths and then by the help of the sun-waves they tear\r\nthe carbon and oxygen apart. Most of the oxygen they throw back\r\ninto the air for us to use, but the carbon they keep.\r\n\r\nIf you will take some fresh laurel-leaves and put them into a\r\ntumbler of water turned upside-down in a saucer of water, and\r\nset the tumbler in the sunshine, you will soon see little bright\r\nbubbles rising up and clinging to the glass. These are bubbles\r\nof oxygen gas, and they tell you that they have been set free by\r\nthe green cells which have torn from them the carbon of the\r\ncarbonic acid in the water.\r\n\r\nBut what becomes of the carbon? And what use is made of the water\r\nwhich we have kept waiting all this time in the leaves? Water,\r\nyou already know, is made of hydrogen and oxygen, but perhaps\r\nyou will be surprised when I tell you that starch, sugar, and\r\noil, which we get from plants, are nothing more than hydrogen\r\nand oxygen in different quantities joined to carbon.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult at first to picture such a black thing as\r\ncarbon making part of delicate leaves and beautiful flowers, and\r\nstill more of pure white sugar. But we can make an experiment by\r\nwhich we can draw the hydrogen and oxygen out of common loaf\r\nsugar, and then you will see the carbon stand out in all its\r\nblackness. I have here a plate with a heap of white sugar in it.\r\nI pour upon it first some hot water to melt and warm it, and then\r\nsome strong sulphuric acid. This acid does nothing more than\r\nsimply draw the hydrogen and oxygen out. See! in a few moments a\r\nblack mass of carbon begins to rise, all of which has come out of\r\nthe white sugar you saw just now. *(The common dilute sulphuric\r\nacid of commerce is not strong enough for this experiment, but\r\npure sulphuric acid can be secured from any chemist. Great care\r\nmust be taken in using it, as it burns everything it touches.) You\r\nsee, then, that from the whitest substance in plants we can get\r\nthis black carbon; and in truth, one-half of the dry part of every\r\nplant is composed of it.\r\n\r\nNow look at my plant again, and tell me if we have not already\r\nfound a curious history? Fancy that you see the water creeping\r\nin at the roots,  oozing up from cell to cell till it reaches the\r\nleaves, and there meeting the carbon which has just come out of\r\nthe air, and being worked up with it by the sun-waves into\r\nstarch, or sugar, or oils.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile, how is new protoplasm to be formed? for without\r\nthis active substance none of the work can go on. Here comes\r\ninto use a lazy gas we spoke of in Lecture III. There we thought\r\nthat nitrogen was of no use except to float oxygen in the air,\r\nbut here we shall find it very useful. So far,  as we know,\r\nplants cannot take up nitrogen out of the air, but they can get\r\nit out of the ammonia which the water brings in at their roots.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, you will remember, is a strong-smelling gas, made of\r\nhydrogen and nitrogen, and which is often almost stifling near a\r\nmanure-heap. When you manure a plant you help it to get this\r\nammonia, but at any time it gets some from the soil and also\r\nfrom the rain-drops which bring it down in the air.  Out of this\r\nammonia the plant takes the nitrogen and works it up with the\r\nthree elements, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, to make the\r\nsubstances called albuminoids, which form a large part of the\r\nfood of the plant, and it is these albuminoids which go to make\r\nprotoplasm. You will notice that while the starch and other\r\nsubstances are only made of three elements,  the active protoplasm\r\nis made of these three added to a fourth, nitrogen, and it also\r\ncontains phosphorus and sulphur.\r\n\r\nAnd so hour after hour and day after day our primrose goes on\r\npumping up water and ammonia from its roots to its leaves,\r\ndrinking in carbonic acid from the air, and using the sun-waves\r\nto work them all up into food to be sent to all parts of its\r\nbody. In this way these leaves act, you see, as the stomach of\r\nthe plant, and digest its food.\r\n\r\nSometimes more water is drawn up into the leaves than can be\r\nused, and then the leaf opens thousands of little mouths in the\r\nskin of its under surface,  which let the drops out just as drops\r\nof perspiration ooze through our skin when we are overheated.\r\nThese little mouths, which are called stomates (a,  Fig. 42) are\r\nmade of two flattened cells, fitting against each other. When\r\nthe air is damp and the plant has too much water these lie open\r\nand let it out, but when the air is dry, and the plant wants to\r\nkeep as much water as it can, then they are closely shut. There\r\nare as many as a hundred thousand of these mouths under one\r\napple-leaf, so you may imagine how small they often are.\r\n\r\nPlants which only live one year, such as mignonette, the sweet\r\npea, and the poppy, take in just enough food to supply their\r\ndaily wants and to make the seeds we shall speak of presently.\r\nThen, as soon as their seeds are ripe their roots begin to\r\nshrivel, and water is no longer carried up.  The green cells can\r\nno longer get food to digest, and they themselves are broken up by\r\nthe sunbeams and turn yellow, and the plant dies.\r\n\r\nBut many plants are more industrious than the stock and\r\nmignonette, and lay by store for another year, and our primrose\r\nis one of these. Look at this thick solid mass below the primrose\r\nleaves, out of which the roots spring. (See the plant in the\r\nforeground of the heading of the lecture.) This is really the\r\nstem of the primrose hidden underground, and all the starch,\r\nalbuminoids, &c., which the plant can spare as it grows, are\r\nsent down into this underground stem and stored up there, to lie\r\nquietly in the ground through the long winter, and then when the\r\nwarm spring comes this stem begins to send out leaves for a new\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 21\r\n\r\nWe have now seen how a plant springs up, feeds itself, grows,\r\nstores up food, withers, and dies; but we have said nothing yet\r\nabout its beautiful flowers or how it forms its seeds. If we\r\nlook down close to the bottom of the leaves in a primrose root\r\nin spring-time, we shall always find three or four little green\r\nbuds nestling in among the leaves, and day by day we may see the\r\nstalk of these buds lengthening till they reach up into the open\r\nsunshine, and then the flower opens and shows its beautiful pale-\r\nyellow crown.\r\n\r\nWe all know that seeds are formed in the flower, and that the\r\nseeds are necessary to grow into new plants. But do we know the\r\nhistory of how they are formed, or what is the use of the\r\ndifferent parts of the bud? Let us examine them all, and then I\r\nthink you will agree with me that this is not the least wonderful\r\npart of the plant.\r\n\r\nRemember that the seed is the one important thing and then notice\r\nhow the flower protects it. First, look at the outside green\r\ncovering, which we call the calyx. See how closely it fits in\r\nthe bud, so that no insects can creep in to gnaw the flower, nor\r\nany harm come to it from cold or blight. Then,  when the calyx\r\nopens, notice that the yellow leaves which form the crown or\r\ncorolla, are each alternate with one of the calyx leaves, so that\r\nanything which got past the first covering would be stopped by\r\nthe second. Lastly,  when the delicate corolla has opened out,\r\nlook at those curious yellow bags just at the top of the tube\r\n(b,2, Fig. 43). What is their use?\r\n\r\nBut I fancy I see two or three little questioning faces which\r\nseem to say,  \"I see no yellow bags at the top of the tube.\" Well,\r\nI cannot tell whether you can or not in the specimen you have in\r\nyour hand; for one of the most curious things about primrose\r\nflowers is, that some of them have these yellow bags at the top of\r\nthe tube and some of them hidden down right in the middle. But\r\nthis I can tell you:those of you who have got no yellow bags at\r\nthe top will have a round knob there (I a, Fig. 43), and will find\r\nthe yellow bags (b) buried in the tube. Those, on the other hand,\r\nwho have the yellow bags (2 b, Fig. 43) at the top will find the\r\nknob (a) half-way down the tube.\r\n\r\nNow for the use of these yellow bags, which are called the\r\nanthers of the stamens, the stalk on which they grow being\r\ncalled the filament or thread.  If you can manage to split them\r\nopen you will find that they have a yellow powder in them,\r\ncalled pollen, the same as the powder which sticks to your nose\r\nwhen you put it into a lily; and if you look with a magnifying\r\nglass at the little green knob in the centre of the flower, you\r\nwill probably see some of this yellow dust sticking on it (A,\r\nFig. 43). We will leave it there for a time, and examine the\r\nbody called the pistil, to which the knob belongs. Pull off the\r\nyellow corolla (which will come off quite easily), and turn back\r\nthe green leaves. You will then see that the knob stands on the\r\ntop of a column, and at the bottom of this column there is a\r\nround ball (s v), which is a vessel for holding the seeds. In\r\nthis diagram (A, Fig. 43) I  have drawn the whole of this curious\r\nball and column as if cut in half, so that we may see what is in\r\nit. In the middle of the ball, in a cluster, there are a number of\r\nround transparent little bodies, looking something like round\r\ngreen orange-cells full of juice. They are really cells full of\r\nprotoplasm, with one little dark spot in each of them, which\r\nby-and-by is to make our little plantlet that we found in the\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n\"These, then, are seeds,\" you will say. Not yet; they are only\r\novules, or little bodies which may become seeds. If they were\r\nleft as they are they would all wither and die. But those little\r\ngrains of pollen, which we saw sticking to the knob at the top,\r\nare coming down to help them. As soon as these yellow grains\r\ntouch the sticky knob or stigma, as it is called, they throw out\r\ntubes, which grow down the column until they reach the ovules. In\r\neach one of these they find a tiny hole, and into this they\r\ncreep, and then they pour into the ovule all the protoplasm from\r\nthe pollen-grain which is sticking above, and this enables it to\r\ngrow into a real seed, with a tiny plantlet inside.\r\n\r\nThis is how the plant forms its seed to bring up new little ones\r\nnext year,  while the leaves and the roots are at work preparing\r\nthe necessary food.  Think sometimes when you walk in the woods,\r\nhow hard at work the little plants and big trees are, all around\r\nyou. You breathe in the nice fresh oxygen they have been\r\nthrowing out, and little think that it is they who are making\r\nthe country so fresh and pleasant, and that while they look as if\r\nthey were doing nothing but enjoying the bright sunshine, they\r\nare really fulfilling their part in the world by the help of\r\nthis sunshine; earning their food from the ground working it up;\r\nturning their leaves where they can best get light (and in this it\r\nis chiefly the violet sun-waves that help them), growing, even at\r\nnight, by making new cells out of the food they have taken in the\r\nday; storing up for the winter; putting out their flowers and\r\nmaking their seeds, and all the while smiling so pleasantly in\r\nquiet nooks and sunny dells that it makes us glad to see them.\r\n\r\nBut why should the primroses have such golden crowns? plain green\r\nones would protect the seed quite as well. Ah! now we come to a\r\nsecret well worth knowing. Look at the two primrose flowers, 1\r\nand 2, Fig. 43, p. 163, and tell me how you think the dust gets\r\non to the top of the sticky knob or stigma. No. 2 seems easy\r\nenough to explain, for it looks as if the pollen could fall down\r\neasily from the stamens on to the knob, but it cannot fall up,\r\nas it would have to do in No. 1. Now the curious truth is, as Mr.\r\nDarwin has shown, that neither of these flowers can get the dust\r\neasily for themselves, but of the two No. 1 has the least\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nLook at a withered primrose, and see how it holds its head down,\r\nand after a little while the yellow crown falls off. It is just\r\nabout as it is falling that the anthers or bags of stamens burst\r\nopen, and then, in No. 1 (Fig.  44), they are dragged over the\r\nknob and some of the grains stick there. But in the other form\r\nof primrose, No. 2, when the flower falls off, the stamens do\r\nnot come near the knob, so it has no chance of getting any\r\npollen; and while the primrose is upright the tube is so narrow\r\nthat the dust does not easily fall. But, as I have said, neither\r\nkind gets it very easily, nor is it good for them if they do. The\r\nseeds are much stronger and better if the dust or pollen of one\r\nflower is carried away and left on the knob or stigma of another\r\nflower; and the only way this can be done is by insects flying\r\nfrom one flower to another and carrying the dust on their legs and\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIf you suck the end of the tube of the primrose flower you will\r\nfind it tastes sweet, because a drop of honey has been lying\r\nthere. When the insects go in to get this honey, they brush\r\nthemselves against the yellow dust-bags,  and some of the dust\r\nsticks to them, and then when they go to the next flower they\r\nrub it off on to its sticky knob.\r\n\r\nLook at No. 1 and No. 2 (Fig. 43) and you will see at once that\r\nif an insect goes into No. 1 and the pollen sticks to him, when\r\nhe goes into No. 2  just that part of his body on which the\r\npollen is will touch the knob; and so the flowers become what we\r\ncall \"crossed,\" that is, the pollen-dust of the one feeds the\r\novule of the other. And just the same thing will happen if he\r\nflies from No. 2 to No. 1. There the dust will be just in the\r\nposition to touch the knob which sticks out of the flower.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can see clearly that it is good for the primrose\r\nthat bees and other insects should come to it, and anything it\r\ncan do to entice them will be useful. Now, do you not think that\r\nwhen an insect once knew that the pale-yellow crown showed where\r\nhoney was to be found, he would soon spy these crowns out as he\r\nflew along? or if they were behind a hedge, and he could not see\r\nthem, would not the sweet scent tell him where to come and look\r\nfor them? And so we see that the pretty sweet-scented corolla is\r\nnot only delightful for us to look at and to smell, but it is\r\nreally very useful in helping the primrose to make strong\r\nhealthy seeds out of which the young plants are to grow next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see what we have learnt. We began with a tiny\r\nseed, though we did not then know how this seed had been made.\r\nWe saw the plantlet buried in it, and learnt how it fed at first\r\non prepared food, but soon began to make living matter for\r\nitself out of gases taken from the water through the cells to\r\nits stomach - the leaves! And how marvellously the sun-waves\r\nentering there formed the little green granules, and then helped\r\nthem to make food and living protoplasm! At this point we might\r\nhave gone further, and studied how the fibres and all the\r\ndifferent vessels of the plant are formed, and a wondrous history\r\nit would have been. But it was too long for one hour's lecture,\r\nand you must read it for yourselves in books on botany. We had to\r\npass on to the flower, and learn the use of the covering leaves,\r\nthe gaily coloured crown attracting the insects, the dust-bags\r\nholding the pollen, the little ovules each with the germ of a new\r\nplantlet, lying hidden in the seed- vessel, waiting for the\r\npollen-grains to grow down to them. Lastly, when the pollen crept\r\nin at the tiny opening we learnt that the ovule had now all it\r\nwanted to grow into a perfect seed.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came back to a primrose seed, the point from which we\r\nstarted;  and we have a history of our primrose from its birth to\r\nthe day when its leaves and flowers wither away and it dies down\r\nfor the winter.\r\n\r\nBut what fairies are they which have been at work here? First,\r\nthe busy little fairy Life in the active protoplasm; and\r\nsecondly, the sun-waves. We have seen that it was by the help of\r\nthe sunbeams that the green granules were made, and the water,\r\ncarbonic acid, and nitrogen worked up into the living plant. And\r\nin doing this work the sun-waves were caught and their strength\r\nused up, so that they could no longer quiver back into space. But\r\nare they gone for ever? So long as the leaves or the stem or the\r\nroot of the plant remain they are gone, but when those are\r\ndestroyed we can get them back again. Take a handful of dry\r\nwithered plants and light them with a match, then as the leaves\r\nburn and are turned back again to carbonic acid, nitrogen, and\r\nwater, our sunbeams come back again in the flame and heat.\r\n\r\nAnd the life of the plant? What is it, and why is this protoplasm\r\nalways active and busy? I cannot tell you. Study as we may, the\r\nlife of the tiny plant is as much a mystery as your life and\r\nmine. It came, like all things,  from the bosom of the Great\r\nFather, but we cannot tell how it came nor what it is. We can\r\nsee the active grains moving under the microscope, but we cannot\r\nsee the power that moves them. We only know it is a power given\r\nto the plant, as to you and to me, to enable it to live its\r\nlife, and to do its useful work in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 22\r\n\r\nLECTURE VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF A PIECE OF COAL\r\n\r\nI have here a piece of coal (Fig. 45), which, though it has been\r\ncut with some care so as to have a smooth face, is really in no\r\nother way different from any ordinary lump which you can pick for\r\nyourself out of the coal-scuttle.  Our work to-day is to relate\r\nthe history of this black lump; to learn what it is, what it has\r\nbeen, and what it will be.\r\n\r\nIt looks uninteresting enough at first sight, and yet if we\r\nexamine it closely we shall find some questions to ask even about\r\nits appearance.  Look at the smooth face of this specimen and see\r\nif you can explain those fine lines which run across so close\r\ntogether as to look like the edges of the leaves of a book.  Try\r\nto break a piece of coal, and you will find that it will split\r\nmuch more easily along those lines than across the other way of\r\nthe lump; and if you wish to light a fire quickly you should\r\nalways put this lined face downwards so that the heat can force\r\nits way up through these cracks and gradually split up the block.\r\nThen again if you break the coal carefully along one of these\r\nlines you will find a fine film of charcoal lying in the crack,\r\nand you will begin to suspect that this black coal must have been\r\nbuilt up in very thin layers, with a kind of black dust between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you will call to mind is that this coal burns and\r\ngives flame and heat, and that this means that in some way\r\nsunbeams are imprisoned in it; lastly, this will lead you to\r\nthink of plants, and how they work up the strength of the\r\nsunbeams into their leaves, and hide black carbon in even the\r\npurest and whitest substance they contain.\r\n\r\nIs coal made of burnt plants, then?  Not burnt ones, for if so it\r\nwould not burn again; but you may have read how the makers of\r\ncharcoal take wood and bake it without letting it burn, and then\r\nit turns black and will afterwards make a very good fire; and so\r\nyou will see that it is probable that our piece of coal is made\r\nof plants which have been baked and altered, but which have still\r\nmuch sunbeam strength bottled up in them, which can be set free\r\nas they burn.\r\n\r\nIf you will take an imaginary journey with me to a coal-pit near\r\nNewcastle, which I visited many years ago, you will see that we\r\nhave very good evidence that coal is made of plants, for in all\r\ncoal-mines we find remains of them at every step we take.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine that we have put on old clothes which will not\r\nspoil, and have stepped into the iron basket (see Fig. 46) called\r\nby the miners a cage, and are being let down the shaft to the\r\ngallery where the miners are at work.  Most of them will probably\r\nbe in the gallery b, because a great deal of the coal in a has\r\nbeen already taken out.  But we will stop in a because there we\r\ncan see a great deal of the roof and the floor.  When we land on\r\nthe floor of the gallery we shall find ourselves in a kind of\r\ntunnel with railway lines laid along it and trucks laden with\r\ncoal coming towards the cage to be drawn up, while empty ones are\r\nrunning back to be loaded where the miners are at work.  Taking\r\nlamps in our hands and keeping out of the way of the trucks, we\r\nwill first throw the light on the roof, which is made of shale or\r\nhardened clay.  We shall not have gone many yards before we see\r\nimpressions of plants in the shale, like those in this specimen\r\n(Fig. 47), which was taken out of a coal-mine at Neath in\r\nGlamorganshire, a few days ago, and sent up for this lecture.\r\nYou will recognize at once the marks of ferns (a), for they look\r\nlike those you gather in the hedges of an ordinary country lane,\r\nand that long striped branch (b) does not look unlike a reed, and\r\nindeed it is something of this kind, as we shall see by-and-by.\r\nYou will find plenty of these impressions of plants as you go\r\nalong the gallery and look up at the roof, and with them there\r\nwill be others with spotted stems, or with stems having a curious\r\ndiamond pattern upon them, and many ferns of various kinds.\r\n\r\nNext look down at your feet and examine the floor.  You will not\r\nhave to search long before you will almost certainly find a piece\r\nof stone like that represented in Fig. 48, which has also come\r\nfrom Neath Colliery.  This fossil, which is the cast of a piece\r\nof a plant, puzzled those who found it for a very long time.  At\r\nlast, however, Mr. Binney found the specimen growing to the\r\nbottom of the trunk of one of the fossil trees with spotted\r\nstems, called Sigillaria; and so proved that this curious pitted\r\nstone is a piece of fossil root, or rather underground stem, like\r\nthat which we found in the primrose, and that the little pits or\r\ndents in it are scars where the rootlets once were given off.\r\n\r\nWhole masses of these root-stems, with ribbon-like roots lying\r\nscattered near them, are found buried in the layer of clay called\r\nthe underclay which makes the floor of the coal, and they prove\r\nto us that this underclay must have been once the ground in which\r\nthe roots of the coal-plants grew.  You will feel still more sure\r\nof this when you find that there is not only one straight gallery\r\nof coal, but that galleries branch out right and left, and that\r\neverywhere you find the coal lying like a sandwich between the\r\nfloor and the roof, showing that quite a large piece of country\r\nmust be covered by these remains of plants all rooted in the\r\nunderclay.\r\n\r\nBut how about the coal itself?  It seems likely, when we find\r\nroots below and leaves and stems above, that the middle is made\r\nof plants, but can we prove it?  We shall see presently that it\r\nhas been so crushed and altered by being buried deep in the\r\nground that the traces of leaves have almost been destroyed,\r\nthough people who are used to examining with the microscope, can\r\nsee the crushed remains of plants in thin slices of coal.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately for us, perfect pieces of plants have been\r\npreserved even in the coal-bed itself.  Do you remember our\r\nlearning in Lecture IV, that water with lime in it petrifies\r\nthings, that is, leaves carbonate of lime to fill up grain by\r\ngrain the fibres of an animal or plant as the living matter\r\ndecays, and so keeps an exact representation of the object?\r\n\r\nNow, it so happens that in a coal-bed at South Ouram, near\r\nHalifax, as well as in some other places, carbonate of lime\r\ntrickled in before the plants were turned into coal, and made\r\nsome round nodules in the plant-bed, which look like cannon-\r\nballs.  Afterwards, when all the rest of the bed was turned into\r\ncoal, these round balls remained crystallized, and by cutting\r\nthin transparent slices across the nodule we can distinctly see\r\nthe leaves and stems and curious little round bodies which make\r\nup the coal.  Several such sections may be seen at the British\r\nMuseum, and when we compare these fragments of plants with those\r\nwhich we find above and below the coal-bed, we find that they\r\nagree, thus proving that coal is made of plants, and of those\r\nplants whose roots grew in the clay floor, while their heads\r\nreached up far above where the roof now is.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, what kind of plants were these? Have we\r\nanything like them living in the world now?  You might perhaps\r\nthink that it would be impossible to decide this question from\r\nmere petrified pieces of plants.  But many men have spent their\r\nwhole lives in deciphering all the fragments that could be found,\r\nand though the section given in Fig. 49 may look to you quite\r\nincomprehensible, yet a botanist can reed it as we read a book.\r\nFor example, at S and L, where stems are cut across, he can learn\r\nexactly how they were build up inside, and compare them with the\r\nstems of living plants, while the fruits cc and the little round\r\nspores lying near them, tell him their history as well as if he\r\nhad gathered them from the tree.  In this way we have learnt to\r\nknow very fairly what the plants of the coal were like, and you\r\nwill be surprised when I tell you that the huge trees of the\r\ncoal-forests, of which we sometimes find trunks in the coal-mines\r\nfrom ten to fifty feet long, are only represented on the earth\r\nnow by small insignificant plants, scarcely ever more than two\r\nfeet, and often not many inches high.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen the little club moss or Lycopodium which grows\r\nall over England, but chiefly in the north, on heaths and\r\nmountains?  At the end of each of its branches it bears a cone\r\nmade of scaly leaves; and fixed to the inside of each of these\r\nleaves is a case called a sporangium, full of little spores or\r\nmoss-seeds, as we may call them, though they are not exactly like\r\ntrue seeds.  In one of these club-mosses called Selaginella, the\r\ncases near the bottom of the cone contain large spores, while\r\nthose near the top contain a powdery dust.  These spores are full\r\nof resin, and they are collected on the Continent for making\r\nartificial lightning in the theatres, because they flare when\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\nNow this little Selaginella is of all living plants the one most\r\nlike some of the gigantic trees of the coal-forests.  If you look\r\nat this picture of a coal-forest (Fig. 51), you will find it\r\ndifficult perhaps to believe that those great trees, with diamond\r\nmarkings all up the trunk, hanging over from the right to the\r\nleft of the picture, and covering all the top with their boughs,\r\ncould be in any way relations of the little Selaginella; yet we\r\nfind branches of them in the beds above the coal, bearing cones\r\nlarger but just like Selaginella cones; and what is most curious,\r\nthe spores in these cones are of exactly the same kind and not\r\nany larger than those of the club-mosses.\r\n\r\nThese trees are called by botanists Lepidodendrons, or scaly\r\ntrees; there are numbers of them in all coal-mines, and one trunk\r\nhas been found 49 feet long.  Their branches were divided in a\r\ncurious forked manner and bore cones at the ends.  The spores\r\nwhich fell from these cones are found flattened in the coal, and\r\nthey may be seen scattered about in the coal-ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 23\r\n\r\nAnother famous tree which grew in the coal-forests was the one\r\nwhose roots we found in the floor or underclay of the coal.  It\r\nhas been called Sigillaria, because it has marks like seals\r\n(sigillum, a seal) all up the trunk, due to the scars left by the\r\nleaves when they fell from the tree.  You will see the\r\nSigillarias on the left-hand side of the coal-forest picture,\r\nhaving those curious tufts of leaves springing out of them at the\r\ntop.  Their stems make up a great deal of the coal, and the bark\r\nof their trunks is often found in the clays above, squeezed flat\r\nin lengths of 30, 60, or 70 feet.  Sometimes, instead of being\r\nflat the bark is still in the shape of a trunk, and the interior\r\nis filled with sane; and then the trunk is very heavy, and if the\r\nminers do not prop the roof up well it falls down and kills those\r\nbeneath it.  Stigmaria is the root of the Sigillaria, and is\r\nfound in the clays below the coal.  Botanists are not yet quite\r\ncertain about the seed-cases of this tree, but Mr. Carruthers\r\nbelieves that they grew inside the base of the leaves, as they do\r\nin the quillwort, a small plant which grows at the bottom of our\r\nmountain lakes.\r\n\r\nBut what is that curious reed-like stem we found in the piece of\r\nshale (see Fig. 47)?  That stem is very important, for it\r\nbelonged to a plant called a Calamite, which, as we shall see\r\npresently, helped to sift the earth away from the coal and keep\r\nit pure.  This plant was a near relation of the \"horsetail,\" or\r\nEquisetum, which grows in our marshes; only, just as in the case\r\nof the other trees, it was enormously larger, being often 20 feet\r\nhigh, whereas the little Equisetum, Fig. 52, is seldom more than\r\na foot, and never more than 4 feet high in England, though in\r\ntropical South America they are much higher.  Still, if you have\r\never gathered \"horsetails,\" you will see at once that those trees\r\nin the foreground of the picture (Fig. 51), with leaves arranged\r\nin stars round the branches, are only larger copies of the little\r\nmarsh-plants; and the seed-vessels of the two plants are almost\r\nexactly the same.\r\n\r\nThese great trees, the Lepidodendrons, the Sigillarias, and the\r\nCalamites, together with large tree-ferns, are the chief plants\r\nthat we know of in the coal-forests.  It seems very strange at\r\nfirst that they should have been so large when their descendants\r\nare now so small, but if you look at our chief plants and trees\r\nnow, you will find that nearly all of them bear flowers, and this\r\nis a great advantage to them, because it tempts the insects to\r\nbring them the pollen-dust, as we saw in the last lecture.\r\n\r\nNow the Lipidodendrons and their companions had no true flowers,\r\nbut only these seed-cases which we have mentioned; but as there\r\nwere no flowering plants in their time, and they had the ground\r\nall to themselves, they grew fine and large.  By-and-by, however,\r\nwhen the flowering plants came in, these began to crowd out the\r\nold giants of the coal-forests, so that they dwindled and\r\ndwindled from century to century till their great-great-\r\ngrandchildren, thousands of generations after, only lift up their\r\ntiny heads in marshes and on heaths, and tell us that they were\r\nbig once upon a time.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed they must have been magnificent in those olden days,\r\nwhen they grew thick and tall in the lonely marshes where plants\r\nand trees were the chief inhabitants.  We find no traces in the\r\nclay-beds of the coal to lead us to suppose that men lived in\r\nthose days, nor lions, nor tigers, nor even birds to fly among\r\nthe trees; but these grand forests were almost silent, except\r\nwhen a huge animal something like a gigantic newt or frog went\r\ncroaking through the marsh, or a kind of grasshopper chirruped on\r\nthe land.  But these forms of life were few and far between,\r\ncompared to the huge trees and tangled masses of ferns and reeds\r\nwhich covered the whole ground, or were reflected in the bosom of\r\nthe large pools and lakes round about which they grew.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if you have some idea of the plants and trees of the\r\ncoal, it is time to ask how these plants became buried in the\r\nearth and made pure coal, instead of decaying away and leaving\r\nbehind only a mixture of earth and leaves?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, I must ask you to take another journey\r\nwith me across the Atlantic to the shores of America, and to land\r\nat Norfolk in Virginia, because there we can see a state of\r\nthings something like the marshes of the coal-forests.  All round\r\nabout Norfolk the land is low, flat, and marshy, and to the south\r\nof the town, stretching far away into North Carolina, is a large,\r\ndesolate swamp, no less than forty miles long and twenty-five\r\nbroad.  The whole place is one enormous quagmire, overgrown with\r\nwater-plants and trees.  The soil is as black as ink from the\r\nold, dead leaves, grasses, roots, and stems which lie in it; and\r\nso soft, that everything would sink into it, if it were not for\r\nthe matted roots of the mosses, ferns, and other plants which\r\nbind it together.  You may dig down for ten or fifteen feet, and\r\nfind nothing but peat made of the remains of plants which have\r\nlived and died there in succession for ages and ages, while the\r\nblack trunks of the fallen trees lie here and there, gradually\r\nbeing covered up by the dead plants.\r\n\r\nThe whole place is so still, gloomy, and desolate, that it goes\r\nby the name of the \"Great Dismal Swamp,\" and you see we have here\r\nwhat might well be the beginning of a bed of coal; for we know\r\nthat peat when dried becomes firm and makes an excellent fire,\r\nand that if it were pressed till it was hard and solid it would\r\nnot be unlike coal.  If, then, we can explain how this peaty bed\r\nhas been kept pure from earth, we shall be able to understand how\r\na coal-bed may have been formed, even though the plants and trees\r\nwhich grow in this swamp are different from those which grew in\r\nthe coal-forests.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is not difficult; streams flow constantly, or\r\nrather ooze into the Great Dismal Swamp from the land that lies\r\nto the west, but instead of bringing mud in with them as rivers\r\nbring to the sea, they bring only clear, pure water, because, as\r\nthey filter for miles through the dense jungle of reeds, ferns,\r\nand shrubs which grow round the marsh, all the earth is sifted\r\nout and left behind.  In this way the spongy mass of dead plants\r\nremains free from earthy grains, while the water and the shade of\r\nthe thick forest of trees prevent the leaves, stems, etc., from\r\nbeing decomposed by the air and sun.  And so year after year as\r\nthe plants die they leave their remains for other plants to take\r\nroot in, and the peaty mass grows thicker and thicker, while tall\r\ncedar trees and evergreens live and die in these vast, swampy\r\nforests, and being in loose ground are easily blown down by the\r\nwind, and leave their trunks to be covered up by the growing moss\r\nand weeds.\r\n\r\nNow we know that there were plenty of ferns and of large\r\nCalamites growing thickly together in the coal-forests, for we\r\nfind their remains everywhere in the clay, so we can easily\r\npicture to ourselves how the dense jungle formed by these plants\r\nwould fringe the coal-swamp, as the present plants do the Great\r\nDismal Swamp, and would keep out all earthy matter, so that year\r\nafter year the plants would die and form a thick bed of peat,\r\nafterwards to become coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 24\r\n\r\nThe next thing we have to account for is the bed of shale or\r\nhardened clay covering over the coal.  Now we know that from time\r\nto time land has gone slowly up and down on our globe so as in\r\nsome places to carry the dry ground under the sea, and in others\r\nto raise the sea-bed above the water.  Let us suppose, then, that\r\nthe great Dismal Swamp was gradually to sink down so that the sea\r\nwashed over it and killed the reeds and shrubs.  Then the streams\r\nfrom the west would not be sifted any longer but would bring down\r\nmud, and leave it, as in the delta of the Nile or Mississippi, to\r\nmake a layer over the dead plants.  You will easily understand\r\nthat this mud would have many pieces of dead trees and plants in\r\nit, which were stifled and died as it covered them over; and thus\r\nthe remains would be preserved like those which we find now in\r\nthe roof of the coal-galleries.\r\n\r\nBut still there are the thick sandstones in the coal-mine to be\r\nexplained.  How did they come there?  To explain them, we must\r\nsuppose that the ground went on sinking till the sea covered the\r\nwhole place where once the swamp had been, and then sea-sand\r\nwould be thrown down over the clay and gradually pressed down by\r\nthe weight of new sand above, till it formed solid sandstone and\r\nour coal-bed became buried deeper and deeper in the earth.\r\n\r\nAt last, after long ages, when the thick mass of sandstones above\r\nthe bed b (Fig. 46) had been laid down, the sinking must have\r\nstopped and the land have risen a little, so that the sea was\r\ndriven back; and then the rivers would bring down earth again and\r\nmake another clay-bed.  Then a new forest would spring up, the\r\nferns, Calamites, Lepidodendrons, and Sigillarias would gradually\r\nform another jungle, and many hundred of feet above the buried\r\ncoal-bed b, a second bed of peat and vegetable matter would begin\r\nto accumulate to form the coal-bed a.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of how the coal which we now dig out of the\r\ndepths of the earth once grew as beautiful plants on the surface.\r\nWe cannot tell exactly all the ground over which these forests\r\ngrew in England, because some of the coal they made has been\r\ncarried away since by rivers and cut down by the waves of the\r\nsea, but we can say that wherever there is coal now, there they\r\nmust have been then.\r\n\r\nTry and picture to yourselves that on the east coast of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham, where all is now black with coal-\r\ndust, and grimy with the smoke of furnaces; and where the noise\r\nof hammers and steam-engines, and of carts and trucks hurrying to\r\nand fro, makes the country re-echo with the sound of labour;\r\nthere ages ago in the silent swamp shaded with monster trees, one\r\nthin layer of plants after another was formed, year after year,\r\nto become the coal we now value so much.  In Lancashire, busy\r\nLancashire, the same thing was happening, and even in the middle\r\nof Yorkshire and Derbyshire the sea must have come up and washed\r\na silent shore where a vast forest spread out over at least 700\r\nor 800 square miles.  In Stafford-shire, too, which is now almost\r\nthe middle of England, another small coal-field tells the same\r\nstory, while in South Wales the deep coal-mines and number of\r\ncoal-seams remind us how for centuries and centuries forests must\r\nhave flourished and have disappeared over and over again under\r\nthe sand of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut what is it that has changed these beds of dead plants into\r\nhard, stony coal?  In the first place you must remember they have\r\nbeen pressed down under an enormous weight of rocks above them.\r\nWe can learn something about this even from our common lead\r\npencils.  At one time the graphite or pure carbon, of which the\r\nblacklead (as we wrongly call it) of our pencils is made, was dug\r\nsolid out of the earth.  but so much has now been used that they\r\nare obliged to collect the graphite dust, and press it under a\r\nheavy weight, and this makes such solid pieces that they can cut\r\nthem into leads for ordinary cedar pencils.\r\n\r\nNow the pressure which we can exert by machinery is absolutely\r\nnothing compared to the weight of all those hundreds of feet of\r\nsolid rock which lie over the coal-beds, and which has pressed\r\nthem down for thousands and perhaps millions of years; and\r\nbesides this, we know that parts of the inside of the earth are\r\nvery hot, and many of the rocks in which coal is found are\r\naltered by heat.  So we can picture to ourselves that the coal\r\nwas not only squeezed into a solid mass, but often much of the\r\noil and gas which were in the leaves of the plants was driven out\r\nby heat, and the whole baked, as it were, into one substance.\r\nThe difference between coal which flames and coal which burns\r\nonly with a red heat, is chiefly that one has been baked and\r\ncrushed more than the other.  Coal which flames has still got in\r\nit the tar and the gas and the oils which the plant stored up in\r\nits leaves, and these when they escape again give back the\r\nsunbeams in a bright flame.  The hard stone coal, on the contrary,\r\nhas lost a great part of these oils, and only carbon remains,\r\nwhich seizes hold of the oxygen of the air and burns without\r\nflame. Coke is pure carbon, which we make artificially by driving\r\nout the oils and gases from coal, and the gas we burn is part of\r\nwhat is driven out.\r\n\r\nWe can easily make coal-gas here in this room.  I have brought a\r\ntobacco-pipe, the bowl of which is filled with a little powdered\r\ncoal, and the broad end cemented up with Stourbridge clay.  When\r\nwe place this bowl over a spirit-lamp and make it very hot, the\r\ngas is driven out at the narrow end of the pipe and lights easily\r\n(see Fig. 53).  This is the way all our gas is made, only that\r\nfurnaces are used to bake the coal in, and the gas is passed into\r\nlarge reservoirs till it is wanted for use.\r\n\r\nYou will find it difficult at first to understand how coal can be\r\nso full of oil and tar and gases, until you have tried to think\r\nover how much of all these there is in plants, and especially in\r\nseeds - think of the oils of almonds, of lavender, of cloves, and\r\nof caraways; and the oils of turpentine which we get from the\r\npines, and out of which tar is made.  When you remember these and\r\nmany more, and also how the seeds of the club-moss now are\r\nlargely charged with oil, you will easily imagine that the large\r\nmasses of coal-plants which have been pressed together and broken\r\nand crushed, would give out a great deal of oil which, when made\r\nvery hot, rises up as gas.  You may often yourself see tar oozing\r\nout of the lumps of coal in a fire, and making little black\r\nbubbles which burst and burn.  It is from this tar that James\r\nYoung first made the paraffin oil we burn in our lamps, and the\r\nspirit benzoline comes from the same source.\r\n\r\nFrom benzoline, again, we get a liquid called aniline, from which\r\nare made so many of our beautiful dyes - mauve, magenta, and\r\nviolet; and what is still more curious, the bitter almonds, pear-\r\ndrops, and many other sweets which children like to well, are\r\nactually flavoured by essences which come out of coal-tar.  Thus\r\nfrom coal we get not only nearly all our heat and our light, but\r\nbeautiful colours and pleasant flavours.  We spoke just now of\r\nthe plants of the coal as being without beautiful flowers, and\r\nyet we see that long, long after their death they give us lovely\r\ncolours and tints as beautiful as any in flower-world now.\r\n\r\nThink, then, how much we owe to these plants which lived and died\r\nso long ago!  If they had been able to reason, perhaps they might\r\nhave said that they did not seem of much use in the world.  They\r\nhad no pretty flowers, and there was no one to admire their\r\nbeautiful green foliage except a few croaking reptiles, and\r\nlittle crickets and grasshoppers; and they lived and died all on\r\none spot, generation after generation, without seeming to do much\r\ngood to anything or anybody.  Then they were covered up and put\r\nout of sight, and down in the dark earth they were pressed all\r\nout of shape and lost their beauty and became only black, hard\r\ncoal.  There they lay for centuries and centuries, and thousands\r\nand thousands of years, and still no one seemed to want them.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day, long, long after man had been living on the\r\nearth, and had been burning wood for fires, and so gradually\r\nusing up the trees in the forests, it was discovered that this\r\nblack stone would burn, and from that time coal has been becoming\r\nevery day more and more useful.  Without it not only should we\r\nhave been without warmth in our houses, or light in our streets\r\nwhen the stock of forest-wood was used up; but we could never\r\nhave melted large quantities of iron-stone and extracted the\r\niron.  We have proof of this in Sussex.  The whole country is\r\nfull of iron-stone, and the railings of St. Paul's churchyard are\r\nmade of Sussex iron.  Iron-foundries were at work there as long\r\nas there was wood enough to supply them, but gradually the works\r\nfell into disuse, and the last furnace was put out in the year\r\n1809.  So now, because there is no coal in Sussex, the iron lies\r\nidle, while in the North, where the iron-stone is near the coal-\r\nmines, hundreds of tons are melted out every day.\r\n\r\nAgain, without coal we could have had no engines of any kind, and\r\nconsequently no large manufactories of cotton goods, linen goods,\r\nor cutlery.  In fact, almost everything we use could only have\r\nbeen made with difficulty and in small quantities; and even if we\r\ncould have made them it would have been impossible to have sent\r\nthem so quickly all over the world without coal, for we could\r\nhave had no railways or steamships, but must have carried all\r\ngoods along canals, and by slow sailing vessels.  We ourselves\r\nmust have taken days to perform journeys now made in a few hours,\r\nand months to reach our colonies.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this we should have remained a very poor\r\npeople.  Without manufactories and industries we should have had\r\nto live chiefly by tilling the ground, and everyone being obliged\r\nto toil for daily bread, there would have been much less time or\r\nopportunity for anyone to study science, or literature, or\r\nhistory, or to provide themselves with comforts and refinements\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nAll this then, those plants and trees of the far-off ages, which\r\nseemed to lead such useless lives, have done and are doing for\r\nus.  There are many people in the world who complain that life is\r\ndull, that they do not see the use of it, and that there seems no\r\nwork specially for them to do.  I would advise such people,\r\nwhether they are grown up or little children, to read the story\r\nof the plants which form the coal.  These saw no results during\r\ntheir own short existences, they only lived and enjoyed the\r\nbright sunshine, and did their work, and were content.  And now\r\nthousands, probably millions, of years after they lived and died,\r\nEngland owes her greatness, and we much of our happiness and\r\ncomfort, to the sunbeams which those plants wove into their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThey burst forth again in our fires, in our brilliant lights, and\r\nin our engines, and do the greater part of our work; teaching us\r\n\r\n \"That nothing walks with aimless feet\r\n  That not one life shall be destroyed,\r\n  Or cast as rubbish to the void,\r\n  When God hath made the pile complete.\"\r\n\r\nIn Memoriam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 25\r\n\r\nLecture IX\r\nBees in the Hive\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to visit with me to-day one of the most\r\nwonderful cities with no human beings in it, and yet it is\r\ndensely populated, for such a city may contain from twenty\r\nthousand to sixty thousand inhabitants. In it you will find\r\nstreets, but no pavements, for the inhabitants walk along the\r\nwalls of the houses; while in the houses you will see no windows,\r\nfor each house just fits its owner, and the door is the only\r\nopening in it. Though made without hands these houses are most\r\nevenly and regularly built in tiers one above the other; and here\r\nand there a few royal palaces, larger and more spacious than the\r\nrest, catch the eye conspicuously as they stand out at the corners\r\nof the streets.\r\n\r\nSome of the ordinary houses are used to live in, while others\r\nserve as storehouses where food is laid up in the summer to feed\r\nthe inhabitants during the winter, when they are not allowed to\r\ngo outside the walls. Not that the gates are ever shut: that is\r\nnot necessary, for in this wonderful city each citizen follows\r\nthe laws; going out when it is time to go out,  coming home at\r\nproper hours, and staying at home when it is his or her duty.\r\nAnd in the winter, when it is very cold outside, the inhabitants,\r\nhaving no fires, keep themselves warm within the city by\r\nclustering together, and never venturing out of doors.\r\n\r\nOne single queen reigns over the whole of this numerous\r\npopulation, and you might perhaps fancy that, having so many\r\nsubjects to work for her and wait upon her, she would do nothing\r\nbut amuse herself. On the contrary, she too obeys the laws laid\r\ndown for her guidance, and never, except on one or two state\r\noccasions, goes out of the city, but works as hard as the rest in\r\nperforming her own royal duties.\r\n\r\nFrom sunrise to sunset, whenever the weather is fine, all is\r\nlife,  activity, and bustle in this busy city. Though the gates\r\nare so narrow that two inhabitants can only just pass each other\r\non their way through them, yet thousands go in and out every hour\r\nof the day; some bringing in materials to build new houses, others\r\nfood and provisions to store up for the winter; and while all\r\nappears confusion and disorder among this rapidly moving throng,\r\nyet in reality each has her own work to do, and perfect order\r\nreigns over the whole.\r\n\r\nEven if you did not already know from the title of the lecture\r\nwhat city this is that I am describing, you would no doubt guess\r\nthat it is a beehive.  For where in the whole world, except\r\nindeed upon an anthill, can we find so busy, so industrious, or\r\nso orderly a community as among the bees? More than a hundred\r\nyears ago, a blind naturalist, Francois Huber, set himself to\r\nstudy the habits of these wonderful insects and with the help of\r\nhis wife and an intelligent manservant managed to learn most of\r\ntheir secrets. Before his time all naturalists had failed in\r\nwatching bees, because if they put them in hives with glass\r\nwindows, the bees, not liking the light, closed up the windows\r\nwith cement before they began to work. But Huber invented a hive\r\nwhich he could open and close at will, putting a glass hive\r\ninside it, and by this means he was able to surprise the bees at\r\ntheir work. Thanks to his studies, and to those of other\r\nnaturalists who have followed in his steps,  we now know almost\r\nas much about the home of bees as we do about our own;  and if we\r\nfollow out to-day the building of a bee-city and the life of its\r\ninhabitants, I think you will acknowledge that they are a\r\nwonderful community, and that it is a great compliment to anyone\r\nto say that he or she is \"as busy as a bee.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to begin at the beginning of the story, let us suppose\r\nthat we go into a country garden one fine morning in May when\r\nthe sun is shining brightly overhead, and that we see hanging\r\nfrom the bough of an old apple-tree a black object which looks\r\nvery much like a large plum-pudding.  On approaching it, however,\r\nwe see that it is a large cluster or swarm of bees clinging to\r\neach other by their legs; each bee with its two fore-legs\r\nclinging to the two hinder legs of the one above it. In this way\r\nas many as 20,000 bees may be clinging together, and yet they\r\nhang so freely that a bee, even from quite the centre of the\r\nswarm, can disengage herself from her neighbours and pass\r\nthrough to the outside of the cluster whenever she wishes.\r\n\r\nIf these bees were left to themselves, they would find a home\r\nafter a time in a hollow tree, or under the roof of a house, or\r\nin some other cavity, and begin to build their honeycomb there.\r\nBut as we do not wish to lose their honey we will bring a hive,\r\nand, holding it under the swarm, shake the bough gently so that\r\nthe bees fall into it, and cling to the sides as we turn it over\r\non a piece of clean linen, on the stand where the hive is to be.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us suppose that we are able to watch what is going on\r\nin the hive. Before five minutes are over the industrious little\r\ninsects have begun to disperse and to make arrangements in their\r\nnew home. A number (perhaps about two thousand) of large,\r\nlumbering bees of a darker colour than the rest, will it is true,\r\nwander aimlessly about the hive, and wait for the others to feed\r\nthem and house them; but these are the drones, or male bees (3,\r\nFig. 54), who never do any work except during one or two days in\r\ntheir whole lives. But the smaller working bees (1, Fig. 54) begin\r\nto be busy at once. Some fly off in search of honey. Others walk\r\ncarefully all round the inside of the hive to see if there are any\r\ncracks in it; and if there are, they go off to the horse-chestnut\r\ntrees, poplars, hollyhocks, or other plants which have sticky\r\nbuds, and gather a kind of gum called \"propolis,\" with which they\r\ncement the cracks and make them air-tight. Others again, cluster\r\nround one bee (2, Fig. 54) blacker than the rest and having a\r\nlonger body and shorter wings; for this is the queen-bee, the\r\nmother of the hive, and she must be watched and tended.\r\n\r\nBut the largest number begin to hang in a cluster from the roof\r\njust as they did from the bough of the apple tree. What are they\r\ndoing there? Watch for a little while and you will soon see one\r\nbee come out from among its companions and settle on\r\nthe top of the inside of the hive,  turning herself round and\r\nround, so as to push the other bees back, and to make a space in\r\nwhich she can work. Then she will begin to pick at the under\r\npart of her body with her fore-legs, and will bring a scale of\r\nwax from a curious sort of pocket under her abdomen. Holding\r\nthis wax in her claws, she will bite it with her hard, pointed\r\nupper jaws, which move to and fro sideways like a pair of\r\npincers, then, moistening it with her tongue into a kind of\r\npaste, she will draw it out like a ribbon and plaster it on the\r\ntop of the hive.\r\n\r\nAfter that she will take another piece; for she has eight of\r\nthese little wax-pockets, and she will go on till they are all\r\nexhausted. Then she will fly away out of the hive, leaving a\r\nsmall lump on the hive ceiling or on the bar stretched across\r\nit; then her place will be taken by another bee who will go\r\nthrough the same manoeuvres. This bee will be followed by\r\nanother,  and another, till a large wall of wax has been built,\r\nhanging from the bar of the hive as in Fig. 55, only that it\r\nwill not yet have cells fashioned in it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bees which have been gathering honey out of doors\r\nbegin to come back laden. But they cannot store their honey, for\r\nthere are no cells made yet to put it in; neither can\r\nthey build combs with the rest, for they have no wax in their\r\nwax-pockets. So they just go and hang quietly on to the other\r\nbees, and there they remain for twenty-four hours,  during which\r\ntime they digest the honey they have gathered, and part of it\r\nforms wax and oozes out from the scales under their body. Then\r\nthey are prepared to join the others at work and plaster wax on\r\nto the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 26\r\n\r\nAnd now, as soon as a rough lump of wax is ready, another set of\r\nbees come to do their work. These are called the nursing bees,\r\nbecause they prepare the cells and feed the young ones. One of\r\nthese bees, standing on the roof of the hive, begins to force\r\nher head into the wax, biting with her jaws and moving her head\r\nto and fro. Soon she has made the beginning of a round hollow,\r\nand then she passes on to make another, while a second bee takes\r\nher place and enlarges the first one. As many as twenty bees\r\nwill be employed in this way, one after another, upon each hole\r\nbefore it is large enough for the base of a cell.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another set of nursing bees have been working just in\r\nthe same way on the other side of the wax, and so a series of\r\nhollows are made back to back all over the comb. Then the bees\r\nform the walls of the cells and soon a number of six-sided\r\ntubes, about half an inch deep, stand all along each side of the\r\ncomb ready to receive honey or bee-eggs.\r\n\r\nYou can see the shape of these cells in c,d, Fig. 56, and notice\r\nhow closely they fit into each other. Even the ends are so\r\nshaped that, as they lie back to back, the bottom of one cell\r\n(B, Fig. 56) fits into the space between the ends of\r\nthree cells meeting it from the opposite side (A, Fig. 56),\r\nwhile they fit into the spaces around it. Upon this plan the\r\nclever little bees fill every atom of space, use the least\r\npossible quantity of wax, and make the cells lie so closely\r\ntogether that the whole comb is kept warm when the young bees\r\nare in it.\r\n\r\nThere are some kinds of bees who do not live in hives, but each\r\none builds a home of its own. These bees - such as the\r\nupholsterer bee, which digs a hole in the earth and lines it\r\nwith flowers and leaves, and the mason bee,  which builds in\r\nwalls - do not make six-sided cells, but round ones, for room is\r\nno object to them. But nature has gradually taught the little\r\nhive-bee to build its cells more and more closely, till they fit\r\nperfectly within each other. If you make a number of round holes\r\nclose together in a soft substance, and then squeeze the\r\nsubstance evenly from all sides, the rounds will gradually take\r\na six-sided form, showing that this is the closest shape into\r\nwhich they can be compressed. Although the bee does not know\r\nthis, yet as gnaws away every bit of wax that can be\r\nspared she brings the holes into this shape.\r\n\r\nAs soon as one comb is finished, the bees begin another by the\r\nside of it,  leaving a narrow lane between, just broad enough for\r\ntwo bees to pass back to back as they crawl along, and so the\r\nwork goes on till the hive is full of combs.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as a length of about five or six inches of the\r\nfirst comb has been made into cells, the bees which are bringing\r\nhome honey no longer hang to make it into wax, but begin to\r\nstore it in the cells. We all know where the bees go to fetch\r\ntheir honey, and how, when a bee settles on a flower, she\r\nthrusts into it her small tongue-like proboscis, which is really\r\na lengthened under-lip, and sucks out the drop of honey. This she\r\nswallows,  passing it down her throat into a honey-bag or first\r\nstomach, which lies between her throat and her real stomach, and\r\nwhen she gets back to the hive she can empty this bag and pass\r\nhoney back through her mouth again into the honey-cells.\r\n\r\nBut if you watch bees carefully, especially in the spring-time,\r\nyou will find that they carry off something else besides honey.\r\nEarly in the morning,  when the dew is on the ground, or later in\r\nthe day, in moist shady places,  you may see a bee rubbing itself\r\nagainst a flower, or biting those bags of yellow dust or pollen\r\nwhich we mentioned in Lecture VII. When she has covered herself\r\nwith pollen, she will brush it off with her feet, and,  bringing\r\nit to her mouth, she will moisten and roll it into a little ball,\r\nand then pass it back from the first pair of legs to the second\r\nand so to the third or hinder pair. Here she will pack it into a\r\nlittle hairy groove called a \"basket\" in the joint of one of the\r\nhind legs, where you may see it, looking like a swelled joint, as\r\nshe hovers among the flowers. She often fills both hind legs in\r\nthis way, and when she arrives back at the hive the nursing bees\r\ntake the lumps form her, and eat it themselves, or mix it with\r\nhoney to feed the young bees; or, when they have any to spare,\r\nstore it away in old honey-cells to be used by-and-by. This is the\r\ndark, bitter stuff called \"bee- bread\" which you often find in a\r\nhoneycomb, especially in a comb which has been filled late in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nWhen the bee has been relieved of the bee-bread she goes off to\r\none of the clean cells in the new comb, and, standing on the\r\nedge, throws up the honey from the honey-bag into the cell. One\r\ncell will hold the contents of many honey-bags, and so the busy\r\nlittle workers have to work all day filling cell after cell, in\r\nwhich the honey lies uncovered, being too thick and sticky to\r\nflow out, and is used for daily food - unless there is any to\r\nspare, and then they close up the cells with wax to keep for the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a day or two after the bees have settled in the hive,\r\nthe queen-bee begins to get very restless. She goes outside the\r\nhive and hovers about a little while, and then comes in again,\r\nand though generally the bees all look very closely after her to\r\nkeep her indoors, yet now they let her do as she likes. Again\r\nshe goes out, and again back, and then, at last, she soars up\r\ninto the air and flies away. But she is not allowed to go alone.\r\nAll the drones of the hive rise up after her, forming\r\na guard of honour to follow her wherever she goes.\r\n\r\nIn about half-an-hour she comes back again, and then the working\r\nbees all gather round her, knowing that now she will remain\r\nquietly in the hive and spend all her time in laying eggs; for\r\nit is the queen-bee who lays all the eggs in the hive. This she\r\nbegins to do about two days after her flight.  There are now many\r\ncells ready besides those filled with honey; and,  escorted by\r\nseveral bees, the queen-bee goes to one of these, and, putting\r\nher head into it remains there a second as if she were examining\r\nwhether it would make a good home for the young bee. Then,\r\ncoming out, she turns round and lays a small, oval, bluish-white\r\negg in the cell. After this she takes no more notice of it, but\r\ngoes on to the next cell and the next, doing the same thing, and\r\nlaying eggs in all the empty cells equally on both sides of the\r\ncomb. She goes on so quickly that she sometimes lays as many as\r\n200 eggs in one day.\r\n\r\nThen the work of the nursing bees begins. In two or three days\r\neach egg has become a tiny maggot or larva, and the nursing bees\r\nput into its cell a mixture of pollen and honey which they have\r\nprepared in their own mouths,  thus making a kind of sweet bath\r\nin which the larva lies. In five or six days the larva grows so\r\nfat upon this that it nearly fills the cell, and then the bees\r\nseal up the mouth of the cell with a thin cover of wax, made of\r\nlittle rings and with a tiny hole in the centre.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the larva is covered in, it begins to give out from\r\nits under-lip a whitish, silken film, made of two threads of silk\r\nglued together, and with this it spins a covering or cocoon all\r\nround itself, and so it remains for about ten days more. At last,\r\njust twenty-one days after the egg was laid, the young bee is\r\nquite perfect, lying in the cell as in Fig. 57, and she begins to\r\neat her way through the cocoon and through the waxen lid, and\r\nscrambles out of her cell. Then the nurses come again to her,\r\nstroke her wings and feed her for twenty-four hours, and after\r\nthat she is quite ready to begin work, and flies out to gather\r\nhoney and pollen like the rest of the workers.\r\n\r\nBy this time the number of working bees in the hive is becoming\r\nvery great,  and the storing of honey and pollen-dust goes on\r\nvery quickly. Even the empty cells which the young bees have\r\nleft are cleaned out by the nurses and filled with honey; and\r\nthis honey is darker than that stored in clean cells,  and which\r\nwe always call \"virgin honey\" because it is so pure and clear.\r\n\r\nAt last, after six weeks, the queen leaves off laying worker-\r\neggs, and begins to lay, in some rather larger cells, eggs from\r\nwhich drones, or male bees, will grow up in about twenty days.\r\nMeanwhile the worker-bees have been building on the edge of the\r\ncones some very curious cells (q, Fig. 57) which look like\r\nthimbles hanging with the open side upwards, and about every three\r\ndays the queen stops in laying drone-eggs and goes to put an egg\r\nin one of these cells. Notice that she waits three days between\r\neach of these peculiar layings, because we shall see presently\r\nthat there is a good reason for her doing so.\r\n\r\nThe nursing bees take great care of these eggs, and instead of\r\nputting ordinary food into the cell, they fill it with a sweet,\r\npungent jelly, for this larva is to become a princess and a\r\nfuture queen bee. Curiously enough,  it seems to be the peculiar\r\nfood and the size of the cell which makes the larva grow into a\r\nmother-bee which can lay eggs, for if a hive has the misfortune\r\nto lose its queen, they take one of the ordinary worker-larvae\r\nand put it into a royal cell and feed it with jelly, and it\r\nbecomes a queen-bee. As soon as the princess is shut in like the\r\nothers, she begins to spin her cocoon, but she does not quite\r\nclose it as the other bees do, but leaves a hole at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 27\r\n\r\nAt the end of sixteen days after the first royal egg was laid,\r\nthe eldest princess begins to try to eat her way out of her\r\ncell, and about this time the old queen becomes very uneasy, and\r\nwanders about distractedly. The reason of this is that there can\r\nnever be two queen-bees in one hive, and the queen knows that\r\nher daughter will soon be coming out of her cradle and will try\r\nto turn her off her throne. So, not wishing to have to fight for\r\nher kingdom, she makes up her mind to seek a new home and take a\r\nnumber of her subjects with her. If you watch the hive about this\r\ntime you will notice many of the bees clustering together after\r\nthey have brought in their honey, and hanging patiently, in order\r\nto have plenty of wax ready to use when they start, while the\r\nqueen keeps a sharp look-out for a bright, sunny day, on which\r\nthey can swarm: for bees will never swarm on a wet or doubtful day\r\nif they can possibly help it, and we can easily understand why,\r\nwhen we consider how the rain would clog their wings and spoil the\r\nwax under their bodies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young princess grows very impatient, and tries to\r\nget out of her cell, but the worker-bees drive her back, for\r\nthey know there would be a terrible fight if the two queens met.\r\nSo they close up the hole she has made with fresh wax after\r\nhaving put in some food for her to live upon till she is\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nAt last a suitable day arrives, and about ten or eleven o'clock\r\nin the morning the old queen leaves the hive, taking with her\r\nabout 2000 drones and from 12,000 to 20,000 worker-bees, which\r\nfly a little way clustering round her till she alights on the\r\nbough of some tree, and then they form a compact swarm ready for\r\na new hive or to find a home of their own.\r\n\r\nLeaving them to go their way, we will now return to the old hive.\r\nHere the liberated princess is reigning in all her glory; the\r\nworker-bees crowd round her, watch over her, and feed her as\r\nthough they could not do enough to show her honour. But still\r\nshe is not happy. She is restless, and runs about as if looking\r\nfor an enemy, and she tries to get at the remaining royal cells\r\nwhere the other young princesses are still shut in. But the\r\nworkers will not let her touch them, and at last she stands still\r\nand begins to beat the air with her wings and to tremble all over,\r\nmoving more and more quickly, till she makes quite a loud, piping\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nHark! What is that note answering her? It is a low, hoarse sound,\r\nand it comes from the cell of the next eldest princess. Now we\r\nsee why the young queen has been so restless. She knows her\r\nsister will soon come out, and the louder and stronger the sound\r\nbecomes within the cell, the sooner she knows the fight will\r\nhave to begin. And so she makes up her mind to follow her\r\nmother's example and to lead off a second swarm. But she cannot\r\nalways stop to choose a fine day, for her sister is growing very\r\nstrong and may come out of her cell before she is off. And so\r\nthe second, or after swarm, gets ready and goes away. And this\r\nexplains why princesses' eggs are laid a few days apart, for if\r\nthey were laid all on the same day, there would be no time for\r\none princess to go off with a swarm before the other came out of\r\nher cell.  Sometimes, when the workers are not watchful enough,\r\ntwo queens do meet, and then they fight till one is killed; or\r\nsometimes they both go off with the same swarm without finding\r\neach other out. But this only delays the fight till they get\r\ninto the new hive; sooner or later one must be killed.\r\n\r\nAnd now a third queen begins to reign in the old hive, and she\r\nis just as restless as the preceding ones, for there are still\r\nmore princesses to be born. But this time, if no new swarm wants\r\nto start, the workers do not try to protect the royal cells. The\r\nyoung queen darts at the first she sees, gnaws a hole with her\r\njaws, and, thrusting in her sting through the hole in the cocoon,\r\nkills the young bee while it is still a prisoner. She then goes to\r\nthe next, and the next, and never rests till all the young\r\nprincesses are destroyed. Then she is contented, for she knows no\r\nother queen will come to dethrone her. After a few days she takes\r\nher flight in the air with the drones, and comes home to settle\r\ndown in the hive for the winter.\r\n\r\nThen a very curious scene takes place. The drones are no more\r\nuse, for the queen will not fly out again, and these idle bees\r\nwill never do any work in the hive. So the worker-bees begin to\r\nkill them, falling upon them, and stinging them to death, and as\r\nthe drones have no stings they cannot defend themselves, and in\r\na few days there is not a drone, nor even a drone-egg,  left in\r\nthe hive. This massacre seems very sad to us, since the poor\r\ndrones have never done any harm beyond being hopelessly idle.\r\nBut it is less sad when we know that they could not live many\r\nweeks, even if they were not attacked, and, with winter coming,\r\nthe bees cannot afford to feed useless mouths, so a quick death\r\nis probably happier for them than starvation.\r\n\r\nAnd now all the remaining inhabitants of the hive settle down to\r\nfeeding the young bees and laying in the winter's store. It is\r\nat this time, after they have been toiling and saving, that we\r\ncome and take their honey; and from a well-stocked hive we may\r\neven take 30 lbs. without starving the industrious little\r\ninhabitants. But then we must often feed them in return and give\r\nthem sweet syrup in the late autumn and the next early spring when\r\nthey cannot find any flowers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the hive has now become comparatively quiet and the work\r\ngoes on without excitement, yet every single bee is employed in\r\nsome way, either out of doors or about the hive. Besides the\r\nhoney collectors and the nurses, a certain number of bees are\r\ntold off to ventilate the hive. You will easily understand that\r\nwhere so many insects are packed closely together the heat will\r\nbecome very great, and the air impure and unwholesome. And the\r\nbees have no windows that they can open to let in fresh air, so\r\nthey are obliged to fan it in from the one opening of the hive.\r\nThe way in which they do this is very interesting. Some of the\r\nbees stand close to the entrance, with their faces towards it,\r\nand opening their wings, so as to make them into fans, they wave\r\nthem to and fro, producing a current of air. Behind these bees,\r\nand all over the floor of the hive, there stand others, this time\r\nwith their backs towards the entrance, and fan in the same\r\nmanner, and in this way air is sent into all the passages.\r\n\r\nAnother set of bees clean out the cells after the young bees are\r\nborn, and make them fit to receive honey, while others guard the\r\nentrance of the hive to keep away the destructive wax-moth,\r\nwhich tries to lay its eggs in the comb so that its young ones\r\nmay feed on the honey. All industrious people have to guard\r\ntheir property against thieves and vagabonds, and the bees have\r\nmany intruders, such as wasps and snails and slugs, which creep\r\nin whenever they get a chance. If they succeed in escaping the\r\nsentinel bees,  then a fight takes place within the hive, and the\r\ninvader is stung to death.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, after they have killed the enemy, the bees\r\ncannot get rid of his body, for a snail or slug is too heavy to\r\nbe easily moved, and yet it would make the hive very unhealthy\r\nto allow it to remain. In this dilemma the ingenious little bees\r\nfetch the gummy \"propolis\" from the plant-buds and cement the\r\nintruder all over, thus embalming his body and preventing it\r\nfrom decaying.\r\n\r\nAnd so the life of this wonderful city goes on. Building,\r\nharvesting,  storing, nursing, ventilating and cleaning from morn\r\ntill night, the little worker-bee lives for about eight months,\r\nand in that time has done quite her share of work in the world.\r\nOnly the young bees, born late in the season,  live on till the\r\nnext year to work in the spring. The queen-bee lives longer,\r\nprobably about two years, and then she too dies, after having had\r\na family of many thousands of children.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that in our fairy-land of nature all\r\nthings work together so as to bring order out of apparent\r\nconfusion. But though we should naturally expect winds and\r\ncurrents, rivers and clouds, and even plants to follow fixed\r\nlaws, we should scarcely have looked for such regularity in the\r\nlife of the active, independent busy bee. Yet we see that she,\r\ntoo, has her own appointed work to do, and does it regularly and\r\nin an orderly manner. In this lecture we have been speaking\r\nentirely of the bee within the hive, and noticing how\r\nmarvellously her instincts guide her in her daily life. But\r\nwithin the last few years we have learnt that she performs a most\r\ncurious and wonderful work in the world outside her home and that\r\nwe owe to her not only the sweet honey to eat, but even in a great\r\ndegree the beauty and gay colours of the flowers which she visits\r\nwhen collecting it. This work will form the subject of our next\r\nlecture, and while we love the little bee for her constant\r\nindustry, patience, and order within the hive, we shall, I think,\r\nmarvel at the wonderful law of nature which guides her in her\r\nunconscious mission of love among the flowers which grow around\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 28\r\n\r\nLecture X\r\nBEES AND FLOWERS\r\n\r\nWhatever thoughts each one of you may have brought to the\r\nlecture to-day, I want you to throw them all aside and fancy\r\nyourself to be in a pretty country garden on a hot summer's\r\nmorning.  Perhaps you have been walking, or reading, or playing,\r\nbut it is getting too hot now to do anything; and so you have\r\nchosen the shadiest nook under the old walnut-tree, close to the\r\nflower-bed on the lawn, and would almost like to go to sleep if\r\nit were not too early in the day.\r\n\r\nAs you lie there thinking of nothing in particular, except how\r\npleasant it is to be idle now and then, you notice a gentle\r\nbuzzing close to you, and you see that on the flower-bed close\r\nby, several bees are working busily among the flowers.  They do\r\nnot seem to mind the heat, nor to wish to rest; and they fly so\r\nlightly and look so happy over their work that it does not tire\r\nyou to look at them.\r\n\r\nThat great humble-bee takes it leisurely enough as she goes\r\nlumbering along, poking her head into the larkspurs, and\r\nremaining so long in each you might almost think she had fallen\r\nasleep.  The brown hive-bee on the other hand, moves busily and\r\nquickly among the stocks, sweet peas, and mignonette.  She is\r\nevidently out on active duty, and means to get all she can from\r\neach flower, so as to carry a good load back to the hive.  In\r\nsome blossoms she does not stay a moment, but draws her head back\r\ndirectly she has popped it in, as if to say \"No honey there.\"\r\nBut over the full blossoms she lingers a little, and then\r\nscrambles out again with her drop of honey, and goes off to seek\r\nmore in the next flower.\r\n\r\nLet us watch her a little more closely.  There are plenty of\r\ndifferent plants growing in the flower-bed, but, curiously\r\nenough, she does not go first to one kind and then to another;\r\nbut keeps to one, perhaps the mignonette, the whole time till she\r\nflies away.  Rouse yourself up to follow her, and you will see\r\nshe takes her way back to the hive.  She may perhaps stop to\r\nvisit a stray plant of mignonette on her way, but no other flower\r\nwill tempt her till she has taken her load home.\r\n\r\nThen when she comes back again she may perhaps go to another kind\r\nof flower, such as the sweet peas, for instance, and keep to them\r\nduring the next journey, but it is more likely that she will be\r\ntrue to her old friend the mignonette for the whole day.\r\n\r\nWe all know why she makes so many journeys between the garden and\r\nthe hive, and that she is collecting drops of honey from each\r\nflower, and carrying it to be stored up in the honeycomb for\r\nwinter's food.  How she stores it, and how she also gathers\r\npollen-dust for her bee-bread, we saw in the last lecture; to-day\r\nwe will follow her in her work among the flowers, and see, while\r\nthey are so useful to her, what she is doing for them in return.\r\n\r\nWe have already learnt from the life of a primrose that plants\r\ncan make better and stronger seeds when they can get pollen-dust\r\nfrom another plant, than when they are obliged to use that which\r\ngrows in the same flower; but I am sure you will be very much\r\nsurprised to hear that the more we study flowers the more we find\r\nthat their colours, their scent, and their curious shapes are all\r\nso many baits and traps set by nature to entice insects to come\r\nto the flowers, and carry this pollen-dust from one to the other.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, it is entirely for this purpose that the\r\nplants form honey in different parts of the flower, sometimes in\r\nlittle bags or glands, as in the petals of the buttercup flower,\r\nsometimes in clear drops, as in the tube of the honeysuckle.\r\nThis food they prepare for the insects, and then they have all\r\nsorts of contrivances to entice them to come and fetch it.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that the plants of the coal had no bright or\r\nconspicuous flowers.  Now we can understand why this was, for\r\nthere were no flying insects at that time to carry the pollen-\r\ndust from flower to flower, and therefore there was no need of\r\ncoloured flowers to attract them.  But little by little, as\r\nflies, butterflies, moths and bees began to live in the world,\r\nflowers too began to appear, and plants hung out these gay-\r\ncoloured signs, as much as to say, \"Come to me, and I will give\r\nyou honey if you will bring me pollen-dust in exchange, so that\r\nmy seeds may grow healthy and strong.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot stop to inquire to-day how this all gradually came\r\nabout, and how the flowers gradually put on gay colours and\r\ncurious shapes to tempt the insects to visit them; but we will\r\nlearn something about the way they attract them now, and how you\r\nmay see it for yourselves if you keep your eyes open.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you watch the different kinds of grasses, sedges\r\nand rushes, which have such tiny flowers that you can scarcely\r\nsee them, you will find that no insects visit them.  Neither will\r\nyou ever find bees buzzing round oak-trees, nut-trees, willows,\r\nelms or birches.  But on the pretty and sweet-smelling apple-\r\nblossoms, or the strongly scented lime-trees, you will find bees,\r\nwasps, and plenty of other insects.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is that grasses, sedges, rushes, nut-trees,\r\nwillow, and the others we have mentioned, have all of them a\r\ngreat deal of pollen-dust, and as the wind blows them to and fro,\r\nit wafts the dust from one flower to another, and so these plants\r\ndo not want the insects, and it is not worth their while to give\r\nout honey, or to have gaudy or sweet-scented flowers to attract\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut wherever you see bright or conspicuous flowers you may be\r\nquite sure that the plants want the bees or some other winged\r\ninsect to come and carry their pollen for them.  Snowdrops\r\nhanging their white heads among their green leaves, crocuses with\r\ntheir violet and yellow flowers, the gaudy poppy, the large-\r\nflowered hollyhock or the sunflower, the flaunting dandelion, the\r\npretty pink willow-herb, the clustered blossoms of the mustard\r\nand turnip flowers, the bright blue forget-me-not and the\r\ndelicate little yellow trefoil, all these are visited by insects,\r\nwhich easily catch sight of them as they pass by and hasten to\r\nsip their honey.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock has shown that bees are not only attracted by\r\nbright colours, but that they even know one colour from another.\r\nHe put some honey on slips of glass with coloured papers under\r\nthem, and when he had accustomed the bees to find the honey\r\nalways on the blue glass, he washed this glass clean, and put the\r\nhoney on the red glass instead.  Now if the bees had followed\r\nonly the smell of the honey, they would have flown to the red\r\nglass, but they did not.  They went first to the blue glass,\r\nexpecting to find the honey on the usual colour, and it was only\r\nwhen they were disappointed that they went off to the red.\r\n\r\nIs it not beautiful to think that the bright pleasant colours we\r\nlove so much in flowers, are not only ornamental, but that they\r\nare useful and doing their part in keeping up healthy life in our\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nNeither must we forget what sweet scents can do.  Have you never\r\nnoticed the delicious smell which comes from beds of mignonette,\r\nthyme, rosemary, mint, or sweet alyssum, from the small hidden\r\nbunches of laurustinus blossom, or from the tiny flowers of the\r\nprivet?  These plants have found another way of attracting the\r\ninsects; they have no need of bright colours, for their scent is\r\nquite as true and certain a guide.  You will be surprised if you\r\nonce begin to count them up, how many white and dull or dark-\r\nlooking flowers are sweet-scented, while gaudy flowers, such as\r\ntulip, foxglove and hollyhock, have little or no scent.  And\r\nthen, just as in the world we find some people who have\r\neverything to attract others to them, beauty and gentleness,\r\ncleverness, kindliness, and loving sympathy, so we find some\r\nflowers, like the beautiful lily, the lovely rose, and the\r\ndelicate hyacinth, which have colour and scent and graceful\r\nshapes all combined.\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet nearly at an end of the contrivances of\r\nflowers to secure the visits of insects.  Have you not observed\r\nthat different flowers open and close at different times?  The\r\ndaisy receives its name day's eye, because it opens at sunrise\r\nand closes at sunset, while the evening primrose (Aenothera\r\nbiennis) and the night campion (Silene noctiflora) spread out\r\ntheir flowers just as the daisy is going to bed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the reason of this?  If you go near a bed of\r\nevening primroses just when the sun is setting, you will soon be\r\nable to guess, for they will then give out such a sweet scent\r\nthat you will not doubt for a moment that they are calling the\r\nevening moths to come and visit them.  The daisy opens by day,\r\nbecause it is visited by day insects, but those particular moths\r\nwhich can carry the pollen-dust of the evening primrose, fly only\r\nby night, and if this flower opened by day other insects might\r\nsteal its honey, while they would not be the right size or shape\r\nto touch its pollen-bags and carry the dust.\r\n\r\nIt is the same if you pass by a honeysuckle in the evening; you\r\nwill be surprised how much stronger its scent is than in the day-\r\ntime.  This is because the sphinx hawk-moth is the favourite\r\nvisitor of that flower, and comes at nightfall, guided by the\r\nstrong scent, to suck out the honey with its long proboscis, and\r\ncarry the pollen-dust.\r\n\r\nAgain, some flowers close whenever rain is coming.  The pimpernel\r\n(Anagallis arvensis) is one of these, hence its name of the\r\n\"Shepherd's Weather-glass.\"  This little flower closes, no doubt,\r\nto prevent its pollen-dust being washed away, for it has no\r\nhoney; while other flowers do it to protect the drop of honey at\r\nthe bottom of their corolla.  Look at the daisies for example\r\nwhen a storm is coming on; as the sky grows dark and heavy, you\r\nwill see them shrink up and close till the sun shines again.\r\nThey do this because in each of the little yellow florets in the\r\ncentre of the flower there is a drop of honey which would be\r\nquite spoiled if it were washed by the rain.\r\n\r\nAnd now you will see why cup-shaped flowers so often droop their\r\nheads - think of the harebell, the snowdrop, the lily-of-the-\r\nvalley, the campanula, and a host of others; how pretty they look\r\nwith their bells hanging so modestly from the slender stalk!\r\nThey are bending down to protect the honey-glands within them,\r\nfor if the cup became full of rain or dew the honey would be\r\nuseless, and the insects would cease to visit them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 29\r\n\r\nBut it is not only necessary that the flowers should keep their\r\nhoney for the insects, they also have to take care and keep it\r\nfor the right kind of insect.  Ants are in many cases great\r\nenemies to them, for they like honey as much as bees and\r\nbutterflies do, yet you will easily see that they are so small\r\nthat if they creep into a flower they pass the anthers without\r\nrubbing against them, and so take the honey without doing any\r\ngood to the plant.  Therefore we find numberless contrivances for\r\nkeeping the ants and other creeping insects away.  Look for\r\nexample at the hairy stalk of the primrose flower; those little\r\nhairs are like a forest to a tiny ant, and they protect the\r\nflower from his visits.  The Spanish catchfly (Silene otites), on\r\nthe other hand, has a smooth, but very gummy stem, and on this\r\nthe insects stick, if they try to climb.  Slugs and snails too\r\nwill often attack and bite flowers, unless they are kept away by\r\nthorns and bristles, such as we find on the teazel and the\r\nburdock.  And so we are gradually learning that everything which\r\na plant does has its meaning, if we can only find it out, and\r\nthat even very insignificant hair has its own proper use, and\r\nwhen we are once aware of this a flower-garden may become quite a\r\nnew world to us if we open our eyes to all that is going on in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n But as we cannot wander among many plants to-day, let us take a\r\nfew which the bees visit, and see how they contrive not to give\r\nup their honey without getting help in return.  We will start\r\nwith the blue wood-geranium, because from it we first began to\r\nlearn the use of insects to flowers.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years ago a young German botanist, Christian\r\nConrad Sprengel, noticed some soft hairs growing in the centre of\r\nthis flower, just round the stamens, and he was so sure that\r\nevery part of a plant is useful, that he set himself to find out\r\nwhat these hairs meant.  He soon discovered that they protected\r\nsome small honey-bags at the base of the stamens, and kept the\r\nrain from washing the honey away, just as our eyebrows prevent\r\nthe perspiration on our faces from running into our eyes.  This\r\nled him to notice that plants take great care to keep their honey\r\nfor insects, and by degrees he proved that they did this in order\r\nto tempt the insects to visit them and carry off their pollen.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to notice in this little geranium flower is that\r\nthe purple lines which ornament it all point directly to the\r\nplace where the honey lies at the bottom of the stamens, and\r\nactually serve to lead the bee to the honey; and this is true of\r\nthe veins and marking of nearly all flowers except of those which\r\nopen by night, and in these they would be useless, for the\r\ninsects would not see them.\r\n\r\nWhen the geranium first opens, all its ten stamens are lying flat\r\non the corolla or coloured crown, as in the left-hand flower in\r\nFig. 58, and then the bee cannot get at the honey.  But in a\r\nshort time five stamens begin to raise themselves and cling round\r\nthe stigma or knob at the top of the seed-vessel, as in the\r\nmiddle flower.  Now you would think they would leave their dust\r\nthere.  But no! the stigma is closed up so tight that the dust\r\ncannot get on to the sticky part.  Now, however, the bee can get\r\nat the honey-glands on the outside of the raised stamens; and as\r\nhe sucks it, his back touches the anthers or dust-bags, and he\r\ncarries off the pollen.  Then, as soon as all their dust is gone,\r\nthese five stamens fall down, and the other five spring up.\r\nStill, however, the stigma remains closed, and the pollen of\r\nthese stamens, too, may be carried away to another flower.  At\r\nlast these five also fall down, and then, and not till then, the\r\nstigma opens and lays out its five sticky points, as you may see\r\nin the right-hand flower, Fig. 58.\r\n\r\nBut its own pollen is all gone, how then will it get any?  It\r\nwill get it from some bee who has just taken it from another and\r\nyounger flower; and thus you see the blossom is prevented from\r\nusing its own pollen, and made to use that of another blossom, so\r\nthat its seeds may grow healthy and strong.\r\n\r\nThe garden nasturtium, into whose blossom we saw the humble-bee\r\npoling his head, takes still more care of its pollen-dust.  It\r\nhides its honey down at the end of its long spur, and only sends\r\nout one stamen at a time instead of five like the geranium; and\r\nthen, when all the stamens have had their turn, the sticky knob\r\ncomes out last for pollen from another flower.\r\n\r\nAll this you may see for yourselves if you find geraniums* in the\r\nhedges, and nasturtiums in you garden.  But even if you have not\r\nthese, you may learn the history of another flower quite as\r\ncurious, and which you can find in any field or lane even near\r\nLondon.  The common dead-nettle (Fig. 59) takes a great deal of\r\ntrouble in order that the bee may carry off its pollen.  When you\r\nhave found one of these plants, take a flower from the ring all\r\nround the stalk and tear it gently open, so that you can see down\r\nits throat.  There, just at the very bottom, you will find a\r\nthick fringe of hairs, and you will guess at once that these are\r\nto protect a drop of honey below.  Little insects which would\r\ncreep into the flower and rob it of its honey without touching\r\nthe anthers of the stamens cannot get past these hairs, and so\r\nthe drop is kept till the bee comes to fetch it.  (*The scarlet\r\nand other bright geraniums of our flower-gardens are not true\r\ngeraniums, but pelargoniums.  You may, however, watch all these\r\npeculiarities in them if you cannot procure the true wild\r\ngeranium.)\r\n\r\nNow look for the stamens; there are four of them, two long and\r\ntwo short, and they are quite hidden under the hood which forms\r\nthe top of the flower.  How will the bee touch them?  If you were\r\nto watch one, you would find that when the bee alights on the\r\nbroad lip and thrusts her head down the tube, she first of all\r\nknows her back against the little forked tip.  This is the sticky\r\nstigma, and she leaves there any dust she has brought from\r\nanother flower; then, as she must push far in to reach the honey,\r\nbefore she comes out again has carried away the yellow powder on\r\nher back, ready to give it to the next flower.\r\n\r\nDo you remember how we noticed at the beginning of the lecture\r\nthat a bee always likes to visit the same kind of plant in one\r\njourney?  You see now that this is very useful to the flowers.\r\nIf the bee went from a dead-nettle to a geranium, the dust would\r\nbe lost, for it would be of no use to any other plant but a dead-\r\nnettle.  But since the bee likes to get the same kind of honey\r\neach journey, she goes to the same kind of flowers, and places\r\nthe pollen-dust just where it is wanted.\r\n\r\nThere is another flower, called the Salvia, which belongs to the\r\nsame family as our dead-nettle, and I think you will agree with\r\nme that its way of dusting the bee's back is most clever.  The\r\nSalvia (Fig. 60) is shaped just like the dead-nettle, with a hood\r\nand a broad lip, but instead of four stamens it has only two, the\r\nother two being shrivelled up.  The two that are left have a very\r\nstrange shape, for the stalk or filament of the stamen is very\r\nshort, while the anther, which is in most flowers two little bags\r\nstuck together, has here grown out into a long thread, with a\r\nlittle dust-bag at one end only.  In 1, Fig. 60, you only see\r\none of these stems, because the flower is cut in half, but in the\r\nwhole flower, one stands on each side just within the lip.  Now,\r\nwhen the bee puts her head into the tube to reach the honey, she\r\npasses right between these two swinging anthers, and knocking\r\nagainst the end pushes it before her and so brings the dust-bag\r\nplump down on her back, scattering the dust there!  you can\r\neasily try this by thrusting a pencil into any Salvia flower, and\r\nyou will see the anther fall.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that all this time the be does not touch the\r\nsticky stigma which hangs high above her, but after the anthers\r\nare empty and shrivelled the stalk of the stigma grows longer,\r\nand it falls lower down.  By-and-by another bee, having pollen on\r\nher back, comes to look for honey, and as she goes into No. 3,\r\nshe rubs against the stigma and leaves upon it the dust from\r\nanother flower.\r\n\r\nTell me, has not the Salvia, while remaining so much the same\r\nshape as the dead-nettle, devised a wonderful contrivance to make\r\nuse of the visits of the bee?\r\n\r\nThe common sweet violet (Viola odorata) or the dog violet (Viola\r\ncanina), which you can gather in any meadow, give up their\r\npollen-dust in quite a different way from the Salvia, and yet it\r\nis equally ingenious.  Everyone has noticed what an irregular\r\nshape this flower has, and that one of its purple petals has a\r\ncurious spur sticking out behind.  In the tip of this spur and in\r\nthe spur of the stamen lying in it the violet hides its honey,\r\nand to reach it the bee must press past the curious ring of\r\norange-tipped bodies in the middle of the flower.  These bodies\r\nare the anthers, Fig. 61, which fit tightly round the stigma, so\r\nthat when the pollen-dust, which is very dry, comes out of the\r\nbags, it remains shut in by the tips as if in a box.  Two of\r\nthese stamens have spurs which lie in the coloured spur of the\r\nflower, and have honey at the end of them.  Now, when the bee\r\nshakes the end of the stigma, it parts the ring of anthers, and\r\nthe fine dust falls through upon the insect.\r\n\r\nLet us see for a moment how wonderfully this flower is arranged\r\nto bring about the carrying of the pollen, as Sprengel pointed\r\nout years ago.  In the first place, it hangs on a thin stalk, and\r\nbends its head down so that the rain cannot come near the honey\r\nin the spur, and also so that the pollen-dust falls forward into\r\nthe front of the little box made by the closed anthers.  Then the\r\npollen is quite dry, instead of being sticky as in most plants.\r\nThis is in order that it may fall easily through the cracks.\r\nThen the style or stalk of the stigma is very thin and its tip\r\nvery broad, so that it quivers easily when the bee touches it,\r\nand so shakes the anthers apart, while the anthers themselves\r\nfold over to make the box, and yet not so tightly but that the\r\ndust can fall through when they are shaken.  Lastly, if you look\r\nat the veins of the flower, you will find that they all point\r\ntowards the spur where the honey is to be found, so that when the\r\nsweet smell of the flower has brought the bee, she cannot fail to\r\ngo in at the right place.\r\n\r\nTwo more flowers still I want us to examine together, and then I\r\nhope you will care to look at every flower you meet, to try and\r\nsee what insects visit it, and how its pollen-dust is carried.\r\nThese two flowers are the common Bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus\r\ncorniculatus), and the Early Orchis (Orchis mascula), which you\r\nmay find in almost any moist meadow in the spring and early\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe Bird's-foot trefoil, Fig. 62, you will find almost anywhere\r\nall through the summer, and you will know it from other flowers\r\nvery like it by its leaf, which is not a true trefoil, for behind\r\nthe three usual leaflets of the clover and the shamrock leaf, it\r\nhas two small leaflets near the stalk.  The flower, you will\r\nnotice, is shaped very like the flower of a pea, and indeed it\r\nbelongs to the same family, called the Papilionaceae or butterfly\r\nfamily, because the flowers look something like an insect flying.\r\n\r\nIn all these flowers the top petal stands up like a flag to catch\r\nthe eye of the insect, and for this reason botanists call it the\r\n\"standard\".  Below it are two side-petals called the \"wings,\" and\r\nif you pick these off you will find that the remaining two petals\r\nare joined together at the tip in a shape like the keel of a\r\nboat.  For this reason they are called the \"keel\".  Notice as we\r\npass that these two last petals have in them a curious little\r\nhollow or depression, and if you look inside the \"wings\" you will\r\nnotice a little knob that fits into this hollow, and so locks the\r\ntwo together.  We shall see by-and-by that this is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 30\r\n\r\nNext let us look at the half-flower when it is cut open, and see\r\nwhat there is inside.  There are ten stamens in all, enclosed\r\nwith the stigma in the keel; nine are joined together and one is\r\nby itself.  The anthers of five of these stamens burst open while\r\nthe flower is still a bud, but the other stamens go on growing,\r\nand push the pollen-dust, which is very moist and sticky, right\r\nup into the tip of the keel.  Here you see it lies right round\r\nthe stigma, but as we saw before in the geranium, the stigma is\r\nnot ripe and sticky yet, and so it does not use the pollen\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that a bee comes to the flower.  The honey she has to\r\nfetch lies inside the tube, and the one stamen being loose she is\r\nable to get her proboscis in.  but if she is to be of any use to\r\nthe flower she must uncover the pollen-dust.  See how cunningly\r\nthe flower has contrived this.  In order to put her head into the\r\ntube the bee must stand upon the wings, and her weight bends them\r\ndown.  but they are locked to the keel by the knob fitting in the\r\nhole, and so the keel is pushed down too, and the sticky pollen-\r\ndust is uncovered and comes right against the stomach of the bee\r\nand sticks there!  As soon as she has done feeding and flies\r\naway, up go the wings and the keel with them, covering up any\r\npollen that remains ready for next time.  Then when the bee goes\r\nto another flower, as she touches the stigma as well as the\r\npollen, she leaves some of the foreign dust upon it, and the\r\nflower uses that rather than its own, because it is better for\r\nits seeds.  If however no bee happens to come to one of these\r\nflowers, after a time the stigma becomes sticky and it uses its\r\nown pollen:  and this is perhaps one reason why the bird's-foot\r\ntrefoil is so very common, because it can do its own work if the\r\nbee does not help it.\r\n\r\nNow we come lastly to the Orchis flower.  Mr. Darwin has written\r\na whole book on the many curious and wonderful ways in which\r\norchids tempt bees and other insects to fertilize them.  We can\r\nonly take the simplest, but I think you will say that even this\r\nblossom is more like a conjuror's box than you would have\r\nsupposed it possible that a flower could be.\r\n\r\nLet us examine it closely.  It has sic deep-red covering leaves,\r\nFig. 62, three belonging to the calyx or outer cup, and three\r\nbelonging to the corolla or crown of the flower; but all six are\r\ncoloured alike, except that the large on in front, called the\r\n\"lip\", has spots and lines upon it which will suggest to you at\r\nonce that they point to the honey.\r\n\r\nBut where are the anthers, and where is the stigma?  Look just\r\nunder the arch made by those three bending flower-leaves, and\r\nthere you will see two small slits, and in these some little\r\nclub-shaped bodies, which you can pick out with the point of a\r\nneedle.  One of these enlarged is shown.  It is composed of\r\nsticky grains of pollen held together by fine threads on the top\r\nof a thin stalk; and at the bottom of the stalk there is a little\r\nround body.  This is all that you will find to represent the\r\nstamens of the flower.  When these masses of pollen, or pollinia\r\nas they are called, are within the flower, the knob at the bottom\r\nis covered by a little lid, shutting them in like the lid of a\r\nbox, and just below this lid you will see two yellowish lumps,\r\nwhich are very sticky.  These are the top of the stigma, and they\r\nare just above the seed-vessel, which you can see in the lowest\r\nflower in the picture.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how this flower gives up its pollen.  When a bee\r\ncomes to look for honey in the orchis, she alights on the lip,\r\nand guided by the lines makes straight for the opening just in\r\nfront of the stigmas.  Putting her head into this opening she\r\npushes down into the spur, where by biting the inside skin she\r\ngets some juicy sap.  Notice that she has to bite, which takes\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nYou will see at once that she must touch the stigmas in going in,\r\nand so give them any pollen she has on her head.  but she also\r\ntouches the little lid and it flies instantly open, bringing the\r\nglands at the end of the pollen-masses against her head.  These\r\nglands are moist and sticky, and while she is gnawing the inside\r\nof the spur they dry a little and cling to her head and she\r\nbrings them out with her.  Darwin once caught a bee with as many\r\nas sixteen of these pollen-masses clinging to her head.\r\n\r\nBut if the bee went into the next flower with these pollinia\r\nsticking upright, she would simply put them into the same slits\r\nin the next flower, she would not touch them against the stigma.\r\nNature, however, has provided against this.  As the bee flies\r\nalong, the glands sticking to its head dry more and more, and as\r\nthey dry they curl up and drag the pollen-masses down, so that\r\ninstead of standing upright, as in 1, Fig. 63, they point\r\nforwards, as in 2.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the bee goes into the next flower, she will thrust\r\nthem right against the sticky stigmas, and as they cling there\r\nthe fine threads which hold the grains together break away, and\r\nthe flower is fertilized.\r\n\r\nIf you will gather some of these orchids during your next spring\r\nwalk in the woods, and will put a pencil down the tube to\r\nrepresent the head of the bee you may see the little box open,\r\nand the two pollen-masses cling to the pencil.  Then if you draw\r\nit out you may see them gradually bend forwards, and by thrusting\r\nyour pencil into the next flower you may see the grains of pollen\r\nbread away, and you will have followed out the work of a bee.\r\n\r\n Do not such wonderful contrivances as these make us long to know\r\nand understand all the hidden work that is going on around us\r\namong the flowers, the insects, and all forms of life?  I have\r\nbeen able to tell you but very little, but I can promise you that\r\nthe more you examine, the more you will find marvellous histories\r\nsuch as these in simple field-flowers.\r\n\r\nLong as we have known how useful honey was to the bee, and how it\r\ncould only get it from flowers, yet it was not till quite lately\r\nthat we have learned to follow out Sprengel's suggestion, and to\r\ntrace the use which the bee is to the flower.  But now that we\r\nhave once had our eyes opened, every flower teaches us something\r\nnew, and we find that each plant adapts itself in a most\r\nwonderful way to the insects which visit it, both so as to\r\nprovide them with honey, and at the same time to make them\r\nunconsciously do it good service.\r\n\r\nAnd so we learn that even among insects and flowers, those who do\r\nmost for others, receive most in return.  The bee and the flower\r\ndo not either of them reason about the matter, they only go on\r\nliving their little lives as nature guides them, helping and\r\nimproving each other.  Think for a moment how it would be, if a\r\nplant used up all its sap for its own life, and did not give up\r\nany to make the drop of honey in its flower.  The bees would soon\r\nfind out that these particular flowers were not worth visiting,\r\nand the flower would not get its pollen-dust carried, and would\r\nhave to do its own work and grow weakly and small.  Or suppose on\r\nthe other hand that the bee bit a hole in the bottom of the\r\nflower, and so got at the honey, as indeed they sometimes do;\r\nthen she would not carry the pollen-dust, and so would not keep\r\nup the healthy strong flowers which make her daily food.\r\n\r\nBut this, as you see, is not the rule.  On the contrary, the\r\nflower feeds the bee, and the bee quite unconsciously helps the\r\nflower to make its healthy seed.  Nay more; when you are able to\r\nread all that has been written on this subject, you will find\r\nthat we have good reason to think that the flowerless plants of\r\nthe Coal Period have gradually put on the beautiful colours,\r\nsweet scent, and graceful shapes of our present flowers, in\r\nconsequence of the necessity of attracting insects, and thus we\r\nowe our lovely flowers to the mutual kindliness of plants and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nAnd is there nothing beyond this?  Surely there is.  Flowers and\r\ninsects, as we have seen, act without thought or knowledge of\r\nwhat they are doing; but the law of mutual help which guides them\r\nis the same which bids you and me be kind and good to all those\r\naround us, if we would lead useful and happy lives.  And when we\r\nsee that the Great Power which rules over our universe makes each\r\nwork for the good of all, even in such humble things as bees and\r\nflowers; and that beauty and loveliness come out of the struggle\r\nand striving of all living things; then, if our own life be\r\nsometimes difficult, and the struggle hard to bear, we learn from\r\nthe flowers that the best way to meet our troubles is to lay up\r\nour little drop of honey for others, sure that when they come to\r\nsip it they will, even if unconsciously, give us new vigour and\r\ncourage in return.\r\n\r\n And now we have arrived at the end of those subjects which we\r\nselected out of the Fairy-land of Science.  You must not for a\r\nmoment imagine, however, that we have in any way exhausted our\r\nfairy domain; on the contrary, we have scarcely explored even the\r\noutskirts of it.  The \"History of a Grain of Salt,\" \"A\r\nButterfly's Life,\" or \"The Labours of an Ant,\" would introduce us\r\nto fairies and wonders quite as interesting as those of which we\r\nhave spoken in these Lectures.  While \"A Flash of Lightning,\" \"An\r\nExplosion in a Coal-mine,\" or \"The Eruption of a Volcano,\" would\r\nbring us into the presence of terrible giants known and dreaded\r\nfrom time immemorial.\r\n\r\nBut at least we have passed through the gates, and have learnt\r\nthat there is a world of wonder which we may visit if we will;\r\nand that it lies quite close to us, hidden in every dewdrop and\r\ngust of wind, in every brook and valley, in every little plant or\r\nanimal.  We have only to stretch out our hand and touch them with\r\nthe wand of inquiry, and they will answer us and reveal the fairy\r\nforces which guide and govern them; and thus pleasant and happy\r\nthoughts may be conjured up at any time, wherever we find\r\nourselves, by simply calling upon nature's fairies and asking\r\nthem to speak to us.  Is it not strange, then, that people should\r\npass them by so often without a thought, and be content to grow\r\nup ignorant of all the wonderful powers ever active in the world\r\naround them?\r\n\r\nNeither is it pleasure alone which we gain by a study of nature.\r\nWe cannot examine even a tiny sunbeam, and picture the minute\r\nwaves of which it is composed, travelling incessantly from the\r\nsun, without being filled with wonder and awe at the marvellous\r\nactivity and power displayed in the infinitely small as well as\r\nin the infinitely great things of the universe.  We cannot become\r\nfamiliar with the facts of gravitation, cohesion, or\r\ncrystallization, without realizing that the laws of nature are\r\nfixed, orderly, and constant, and will repay us with failure or\r\nsuccess according as we act ignorantly or wisely; and thus we\r\nshall begin to be afraid of leading careless, useless, and idle\r\nlives.  We cannot watch the working of the fairy \"life\" in the\r\nprimrose or the bee, without learning that living beings as well\r\nas inanimate things are governed by these same laws of nature;\r\nnor can we contemplate the mutual adaptation of bees and flowers\r\nwithout acknowledging that it teaches the truth that those\r\nsucceed best in life who, whether consciously or unconsciously,\r\ndo their best for others.\r\n\r\nAnd so our wanderings in the Fairy-land of Science will not be\r\nwasted, for we shall learn how to guide our own lives, while we\r\ncannot fail to see that the forces of nature, whether they are\r\napparently mechanical, as in gravitation or heat; or intelligent,\r\nas in living beings, are one and all the voice of the Great\r\nCreator, and speak to us of His Nature and His Will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Fairy-Land of Science , by Arabella B.
