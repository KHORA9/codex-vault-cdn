I make no claim for this little\r\nbook as an addition to dairy science. It is rather a subtraction.\r\nI mean that I have been careful to include only the most essential\r\ninformation. Where a great mass of scientific data is gathered, it\r\ntakes discrimination to distinguish between matters of great and\r\nless importance. To do this discriminating and to point out the most\r\nessential things, as I see them, is the purpose of this undertaking.\r\n\r\nThose who wish more detailed information can easily find it prepared\r\nby those who have studied this matter in detail. I have not. In my\r\nexperience in the dairy business I have tried to use to the best and\r\nmost practical advantage the scientific knowledge that I could acquire\r\nfrom others. My experience has all been an effort to apply science to\r\nbusiness. It has been a business experience, not one of research and\r\ninvestigation. There is much that I have found to be of no particular\r\nuse to me, but there are many things that I have found to be of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nScience digs out facts, figures, data, knowledge, or whatever it may be\r\ncalled. To take facts of science and make use of them in business is\r\none thing which Webster’s dictionary calls an art. This booklet, then,\r\nmay not be classed as science for the writer is not so very scientific;\r\nit is not in itself a work of art for the writer is not strong on\r\nartistic ability; but is written on the art of keeping cows and paying\r\nthe feed bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Stock and Stalks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                 INTENSIVE VERSUS BY-PRODUCT DAIRYING\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture as a science is comparatively new. It is not like civil\r\nengineering, for instance, which is taught about alike in all places,\r\nand much of it the same as was taught a generation ago. Since I can\r\nremember most of what is now known about dairy science has been\r\ndiscovered. It is not surprising, therefore, that as the various\r\nideas and doctrines come out they have both adherents and opponents.\r\nIt takes time to clarify a situation and to prove what is the right\r\nconclusion. Some blame our agricultural colleges for not knowing more\r\nand knowing it sooner, and for spreading what we now know to have been\r\nin some cases misinformation. But the course taken was really the only\r\none possible. Experiment stations have to try out a lot of theories\r\nin order to find which are wrong and which are right. At present\r\nthere are many things still unknown and much difference of opinion.\r\nIf the discussion which follows seems to differ in some respects with\r\nrecognized authorities, I still think that I may be right; and if\r\nwrong, I claim as good a right as any one else to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nHere are some things to think about. At one time there were more real\r\ndairy cattle in Lancaster county than there are at present. There were\r\nfairly large herds of grade Holsteins producing milk where now there\r\nare scarcely any cattle at all. Intensive dairying at one time had\r\na fine start in Lancaster county, but now there is not a herd large\r\nenough to be called a dairy, except those owned by purebred breeders.\r\nThe city milk supply comes from a large number of farmers who produce\r\nmilk as a side issue. The methods of feeding and caring for cattle\r\non these farms is in the main contrary to the instructions given by\r\nthe dairy department at the State Farm. The men who made dairying a\r\nbusiness here were learning and following agricultural college methods.\r\nThey had good grade dairy cattle and produced fully twice as much per\r\ncow as do the farmers now in the business. They all quit because it did\r\nnot pay.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that I was one of the men thus engaged. I had a fine\r\nherd of fifty high-grade Holsteins that were producing as much milk as\r\nis now being produced by thirty of our average dairy farmers. My herd\r\nwas sold after losing money for two years. We were in a cow-testing\r\nassociation at the time and the fine records made by these cows helped\r\nto sell them at a public sale. Right in sight of the agricultural\r\ncollege all that had been accomplished seemed to fade away, and the old\r\nred cow, which dairy science has tried for a generation to kill, came\r\nback to the very skirts of the city. Just now if every dairy cow in\r\nNebraska would be slaughtered, their milk would hardly be missed but if\r\nthe old red cow would go on a strike, not a wheel in any creamery of\r\nthe state would be turning next week.\r\n\r\nWhy this remarkable turn of events? Well, there are two theories.\r\nOne of these lets the agricultural college and all of us out without\r\ndisgrace and is something of a slam on the farmer. The other gives the\r\nfarmer credit for having more sense than we had. Certain it is that the\r\nfarmer milking his beef cow produced milk for less than we Holstein\r\nmen could do it. The first theory is that the farmer did not know\r\nhis costs and therefore kept right on while the deficiency came out\r\nof his hide. The second is that the farmer had us beat on the cost of\r\nproduction. Is one or the other of these theories correct? It must be.\r\nIt would be like taking the hot end of a poker for me to argue that the\r\nfarmer is a fool and to have one of his number remark that, even though\r\nhe was, I went out of business against his competition. Some one else\r\nwill have to argue that side. I have a different explanation.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the difference came about in the general rise in price\r\nof labor, grain, and alfalfa. The milk that we produced was like a\r\ngarment cut out of new cloth--it all cost real money. The farmer’s\r\nmilk was largely produced from corn stalks, wheat pasture, stubble\r\nfields, and draws pastured--material that must either be turned into\r\nmilk or wasted. It had scarcely any market value. Our methods and our\r\ncattle were superior to his in many ways, but not enough to make up the\r\ndifference in the cost of feed. The common method on the farm is to\r\npasture corn stalks during the winter. It is a very wasteful method of\r\nfeeding but it requires no labor. The cows gather the corn that was\r\nmissed in the field and eat the leaves and husks. Few cows may be kept\r\non a farm where such methods are in use, but figuring the stalk of no\r\nvalue, such methods produce the cheapest butter fat in the world. The\r\nfarmer had us beat on the cost of production. He did not feed grain and\r\nforget to figure its value. He fed the grain that the huskers left in\r\nthe field. It had no value except as it came to the milk pail.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: When the Dairy Cow Needs a Friend]\r\n\r\nAt one time I worked on a ranch in western Colorado where a large\r\nnumber of range cattle were wintered. Alfalfa in that community was\r\nselling for three dollars a ton, but we fed it to the weaker cattle\r\nonly. The strong ones could live on sage brush which cost nothing.\r\nSage brush was not a better feed. It was not nearly so good, but the\r\nadvantages offset the disadvantages. So it was with us. The advantages\r\nof the two systems were weighed and ours found wanting.\r\n\r\nThe average farmer’s cow is a “scrub.” She usually goes dry for three\r\nor four months of the year and, even when fresh, gives about half\r\nwhat a developed dairy animal should give. Why do farmers persist in\r\nmilking “scrubs,” then? Have we not all told them better? I’ll say so!\r\nHolsteins and Jerseys are not so rare that farmers do not know what\r\nthey are. Most farmers have owned a few but have gone back to the old\r\nred stand-by. Why? Are we wrong again?\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, and all over the east the red\r\ncow is disappearing. People there do a great deal more of dairying\r\nthan we do. Who knows the business better, they who do dairying as a\r\nbusiness or we who do not? But arguments are of no use when they go\r\nagainst known facts. The color of the cow is the result of a condition.\r\nThe red cow has been better suited to a farmer’s conditions and\r\nrequirements. Dairy cattle can not rough it like beef or dual-purpose\r\ncattle. Where the custom is to stable feed and give good care to\r\ncattle, dairy breeds naturally take the lead. Where the dairy business\r\nis a side issue, and besides giving milk a cow is expected to face cold\r\nwinds and to withstand periods of semi-starvation, the dairy type is\r\nnot in it.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: The strong, lean, well-developed dairy cows that have\r\n              never been weakened by starvation or cold.]\r\n\r\nTo understand the cattle business we must understand the fundamental\r\nprinciples upon which the various kinds of cattle are built. Hereford\r\ncattle, for instance, are a pure beef type. The beef animal is trained\r\nand perfected in the tendency to save everything to itself and to\r\nload up with fat and muscle. Some Hereford cows can hardly raise\r\ntheir calves because of the tendency of the mother to save all her\r\nnourishment for her own strength and protection. The cow boys on\r\nthe range rarely think of milking a cow that has lost her calf. The\r\ntypical beef animals give so little milk that they can go dry at any\r\ntime even on good grass with little or no injury to themselves. Some\r\ndairy cows would die even though sucked by a big husky calf if they\r\nwere not milked, because they give so much more than the calf could\r\ntake. The dairy cow is bred and trained for generations to digest all\r\nshe can and to give it all away, keeping nothing with which to protect\r\nherself against hard times. She builds no big muscles with which to\r\nclimb mountains, or wade through mud and snow drifts. The beef animal\r\nif treated like a dairy cow simply gets fat and is finally turned to\r\nthe butcher. The dairy cow treated like a beef cow is a tragedy to\r\nbehold. I have seen both Holstein and Jersey steers out on the range\r\nwhere Hereford cattle stay fat and strong and I have heard the cow\r\nboys cuss about letting them live, for they were more of a ghost than\r\na reality. Cussed they were by men and God-forsaken, so it would seem.\r\nSince even the steers can not protect themselves to live where the\r\nHerefords will thrive, what can we ever expect of a producing cow? When\r\nshe has given all away then goes up against the period of short pasture\r\nor semi-starvation, she begins immediately to readjust to meet the new\r\nconditions. But the work of generations can not be undone in a life\r\ntime and she fails to meet the emergency and loses the vitality she\r\nnaturally possesses.\r\n\r\nThe red farmer’s cow is often called the dual-purpose animal. She is\r\nabout half way between the beef and the dairy. She protects herself\r\nwell but not to the limit as does the Hereford. She produces milk well\r\nbut not nearly so well as do the highly-bred and highly-developed\r\nstrictly dairy types. Not one of these three types of cows will do to\r\nsubstitute for any other. Each has a place to fill and each is the best\r\nanimal in her place. There is nothing more foolish than to substitute\r\nthe dairy breeds for common cattle before we substitute the dairy man\r\nfor the farmer or else convert the farmer to the dairyman’s methods\r\nin feeding. The corn stalks and waste feed make the cheapest milk and\r\nthe red cow is the most economical means of converting such feeds into\r\nmilk, provided we want only a small production with the least possible\r\neffort. It takes more labor to prepare feed for animals and feed it to\r\nthem than it does to let the animals range around over the field and do\r\nthe best they can. If farm dairying is to be carried on in the future\r\njust as it has been in the past, the red cow is the farmer’s best\r\nfriend and he is not a fool for recognizing her as such.\r\n\r\nThis is not a pet theory of mine. It is a conclusion that I have had to\r\nswallow against my will. The situation has nothing of promise for the\r\nfuture. If we become a dairy state, we will have to put more labor and\r\neffort into milk production and do more like they do in other states.\r\nThe stalks left standing in the field, feeding but a few thick-skinned\r\ncattle make the cheapest milk, only in case we figure the by-product\r\nfeeds as of no value. We could produce a great deal more cattle for\r\nbeef and for dairy purposes if we utilized what we now waste. If all\r\nthe corn in our state was shocked this year, think how much good feed\r\nwould remain after the grain is husked out. Think how many cattle might\r\nbe wintered. The stalks from one acre of average corn if properly\r\nconserved yield nearly enough rough feed for one cow during the entire\r\nwinter. Fifty acres yield fully enough for forty head of cattle. Of\r\ncourse we should use alfalfa for part of the ration but alfalfa is our\r\ncheapest feed that is not a by-product. Grain will be required for\r\ncattle that milk, but raising calves and keeping dry stock is as much\r\na part of milk production as anything else. All such cattle can be\r\nwell-nourished and developed without grain. It will not pay to refine\r\nthem to such an extent that they can not live on rough feed.\r\n\r\nBut conditions are changing again. Labor, grain, and alfalfa are all\r\ncoming down and land is high in price. We will not long be taking only\r\nwhat we can get the easiest. The time is at hand when we are going\r\nto imitate the packer who saves all but the squeal. The conditions\r\nexisting in the eastern states will be found here. I do not know how\r\nsoon but they are coming. It will be a long time before the specialized\r\nproducer can compete with the by-product feeder, but the latter is\r\ngoing to save more of what he has and use it to better advantage as\r\nsoon as he can get labor. Dairy products are going to be in great\r\nenough demand to pay the extra labor costs. I do not look for all\r\nof the system to be reversed. The farmer’s idea of feeding cattle\r\nwhat could be used for nothing else has been and will still be his\r\nsalvation. Those of us who produced nothing but milk were wrong, from\r\nthe standpoint of economy, in my opinion. What I look for now is a\r\ncombination between the two systems. Cows will be taken care of as\r\nwell as we cared for our high producers, there will be a change in the\r\nmethods of caring for feed, but a large part of the feed will be the\r\nby-products of other farming operations. What is the use of feeding all\r\ngreen-backs when we can make use of feed that costs nothing? We could\r\nproduce more milk by using specialized methods altogether but we can\r\nmake enough without, and it will be cheaper.\r\n\r\nBut the standard methods, that always have been and still are taught,\r\nare altogether intensive. Every one talks of high records. There is not\r\nenough talk of low-cost records.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was published in the Nebraska Farmer the\r\ncow-testing association records of herds in Lancaster county. Some of\r\nthese herds yielded a large production and others yielded much less.\r\nBut the herds that produced less yielded at a higher rate of profit.\r\nThe difference was in the amount of grain and expensive foods consumed\r\nin proportion to the production. During the last few years those who\r\nhave fed grain and alfalfa as we used to feed, have found it difficult\r\nto meet expenses. We used to be taught that, since a cow required so\r\nmuch to maintain her body whether she produced milk or not and only\r\nthe amount she consumed above that amount could be available for milk\r\nproduction, it was well to feed as much grain as possible without\r\ninjuring the cow or reducing her flow. But the price of feed must\r\nbe reckoned, as all admit now. And if grain is too high the larger\r\nproportion of our milk must come from the cheaper feeds. At present\r\nthe grain market looks very bad and intensive dairying would be more\r\nprofitable now than it has been for a long time.\r\n\r\nBut the combination, which I think is ideal, will be the best\r\nproposition all of the time. In all further discussions in this booklet\r\nI refer to dairy breeds exclusively for I believe that the tide is\r\nturning and if the red cow and the old methods are still to take the\r\nlead, it is a waste of time to study dairying. If farmers wish to\r\nincrease their milk production and find their way clear to devote more\r\ntime to their cattle, this discussion may be of some assistance.\r\n\r\nDairy cows have certain definite requirements. One of the most\r\nimportant of these is that they go through no periods in which they do\r\nnot have all they want to eat of at least good grass or good hay or\r\nroughage. If the grass begins to get a little short in the summer, we\r\nmust not neglect to feed. Another important requirement of the dairy\r\ncow is that she be not exposed to hardships such as cold winds and\r\nrains. Starvation and storms, these two things above all--we must guard\r\nthe dairy cow against.\r\n\r\nI will describe how I think dairying should be conducted for the most\r\nprofit on the farm so that the by-products may be utilized to the\r\nfullest extent practicable and at the same time the dairy type cattle\r\nmay be kept producing to good advantage. I am not inventing this\r\nsystem, for I am describing the common practice of the people in the\r\ndairy states. In Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota cattle are kept\r\nlargely on by-products. In the cheap feed lies the profits.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I have described my own methods of handling pasture, the idea\r\nof which came from Europe. But as to winter feeding, the whole eastern\r\npart of the United States sets a good example. I would want one or two\r\nsilos, small in diameter but tall. I would want one acre of alfalfa and\r\none acre of pasture for every cow that I expected to keep. If we have\r\na large number of young stock, the pasture would need to be increased.\r\nI would fill these silos with corn, grain and all, and use the silage\r\nto feed only the cows giving milk. I would use a Smalley feed cutter\r\nwith snapping attachments and use cut-up dry fodder containing no grain\r\nas the principal feed for the dry cows and all young stock on the\r\nplace. The farmer usually milks only one-half as many cows as he has\r\ncattle all together. By using “Flink’s Perfect Silo Seal” to protect\r\nthe silage it may be fed all summer whenever needed without waste.\r\nWhat stalks remain to be pastured may be pastured by the milk cows\r\nand so may wheat be pastured during good weather. I would depend upon\r\nby-product feed for dry cattle and for part of the milk cow’s ration.\r\nThe amount of grain that is in corn silage is never too much for any\r\ncow that is giving milk, but silage, corn and all, is too expensive for\r\ncattle that are not milking.\r\n\r\nBy such methods the eastern farmer easily keeps at least twice the\r\nnumber of cattle that the average farmer here is now keeping, and\r\nstill he takes but little more of his land away from other farming\r\noperations. The intensive dairyman uses all that he raises for his\r\ncows and usually buys some besides. The by-product farmer in Nebraska\r\nhas been in the habit of setting aside hardly any acreage for the use\r\nof his cattle. But the combination is positively a success and would\r\nhave long ago been more in use in Nebraska had not the labor situation\r\npresented difficulties almost impossible to overcome. My farm is small\r\nand borders on the very edge of the city. Intensive dairying is the\r\nonly thing practical for me even though I can not expect to produce as\r\ncheaply as farmers differently situated. I am re-stocking the farm this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                            THE DAIRY TYPE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Capacity.= The first thing that we look for in a dairy cow is\r\ncapacity--capacity to digest feed and to turn that feed into milk. The\r\ndigestive and mammary systems of the cow should be strongly developed.\r\nOn account of the location of these organs the dairy type of cow is\r\nwedge-shaped, being wider and deeper at the rear. Her wedge-shaped\r\nbody, however, should be fairly wide over her heart and lung section,\r\nfor she is required to breathe a great deal of air and to have great\r\nblood circulation. Her udder and milk veins should be well-developed.\r\nThe four quarters of the udder should be fairly uniform in size. Her\r\nmilk veins are more likely to indicate her history than her capacity,\r\nfor no cow has very large veins until they have been developed by\r\nheavy milk production. Still in all good dairy heifers you will find\r\nwell-established milk veins carried fairly well forward. These things\r\nindicate the capacity of the animal.\r\n\r\n=Tendencies.= We must now determine her tendencies. She must not\r\nconvert her food into beef nor must she destroy her energy by\r\nnervousness and a tendency to too great physical activity. The head of\r\nthe cow should be clean-cut and lean, the neck long and lean, and the\r\nshoulders narrow at the top. The joints should be open so that a man’s\r\nfist could be thrust between the cow’s front leg and her body. The cow\r\nshould not be beefy at the rear. Even though she be fat she should not\r\nbe of a square beef type. The udder should be attached high behind\r\nand the thighs should be narrow. In fact, we want a cow that is not\r\nan “easy keeper” but that will milk out clean. The cow should be soft\r\nskinned and fine haired. Beware of the wild-eyed, nervous, quick-moving\r\ncow for she wastes her energy. Beware of the sluggish cow for she will\r\nbe sluggish in appetite and will convert her feed into fat instead of\r\nmilk. Perhaps the best way to describe the disposition of a good dairy\r\ncow would be to say that she is alert and intelligent but calm and\r\nsensible.\r\n\r\n=Physical Defects.= If you find that you have a cow with the capacity\r\nand the tendency to produce, it is time to look for the physical\r\ndefects in the animal. Probably more men fail to notice physical\r\ndefects than any other thing, when buying cattle. Begin by examining\r\nthe mouth of the cow. The age of the cow can be approximately told by\r\nlooking at the front teeth. If the cow is young, her teeth are square,\r\nflat, and close together. When the cow gets older, they are round and\r\nwedge-shaped and tend to separate. At about twelve years the cow begins\r\nto lose some of her front teeth. In judging a cow’s development and\r\npossibilities her age must always be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe eye must look bright. A sick cow usually shows it in her face and\r\nin the way she holds her head with her nose sticking a little too far\r\nforward. She has lost her spirit. If the skin is rough, it is likely to\r\nindicate in some cases poor digestion and in other cases coarseness.\r\nIn either case we do not want the cow. The thin form of the good milk\r\ncow without an ounce of surplus flesh must not give the impression of\r\ndebility, but of efficiency and strength. The cow having digestive\r\ntrouble is usually shrunken in the paunch and has the appearance of her\r\nskin being drawn tightly around her body in front of the udder. She\r\nshould not be constipated, nor should she have scours.\r\n\r\nThe udder should not be meaty. After a cow is milked, her udder should\r\nbe nearly like an empty sack. Each teat should be milked to see that\r\nit contains no evidence of garget. Each quarter of the udder should\r\nbe felt to see that it contains no portion slightly more solid than\r\nthe others. The teats should be examined for slight lumps which have\r\nusually been caused by rough milking and which may make a lot of\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n=Diseases.= Tuberculosis in cattle is a disease that is more contagious\r\namong barn-fed cattle than among those kept more in the open. In fact,\r\nI have never heard of range cattle being tubercular. Nevertheless,\r\nunder conditions that exist on the average farm, the tuberculosis germ\r\nwill thrive and cause havoc. It pays to be careful not to introduce\r\nsuch a disease into the herd. Often the fattest, sleekest cattle\r\nare affected and while they do not die from it quickly, yet as it\r\nprogresses in a herd an animal will now and then die from the disease.\r\nHogs and even chickens running with the cattle become affected and much\r\nloss results.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the tuberclin test in the main has been established\r\nbeyond doubt. Laws now require that cattle which are shipped from\r\none state to another be tested, and the infected cattle can not be\r\nlegally shipped except to a slaughter house subject to inspection.\r\nHowever, many cattle are shipped under false certificates sworn to by\r\nunscrupulous veterinaries. The only thing that we can do about it is\r\nto be careful in buying, deal with responsible men and buy the cattle\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe number of cattle infected in Nebraska is probably about two per\r\ncent in the average farming districts and a much higher per centage\r\namong the strictly dairy herds of some sections. While we do not feel\r\nthat we are ready for a law compelling all cattle to be tested, we do\r\nfeel that each individual should protect himself and keep his herd\r\nfree from infection. Bovine tuberculosis is not so contagious among\r\nhuman beings as it was once thought to be. But it is enough so that no\r\nfurther argument should be necessary to an owner of stock than that his\r\nown family or some one else may be infected with the disease from the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nNext to tuberculosis, contagious abortion is probably the milk\r\nproducer’s worst enemy. I do not know of any way for a farmer to detect\r\nthis disease from an animal’s appearance. I usually look for evidence,\r\nnot in the cattle themselves, but on the farm premises of the man who\r\nhas cattle for sale. Be suspicious of any cow that does not readily get\r\npregnant. When buying fresh cows always endeavor to see the cow’s calf.\r\nThis is not a doctor book. I need not discuss the symptoms nor the\r\ncure. I only wish to warn the buyer to be on the lookout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE PURE BRED SIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one law of breeding that does not seem to be recognized by\r\npeople generally and in our judgment it is of greatest importance. This\r\nlaw is that the influence of the parent animals are not equal upon\r\nthe offspring. This has been noticed in human experiences. No child\r\nis exactly one-half like his father and one-half like his mother, but\r\nis likely to be much like either one or the other. He is likely to\r\nbe nine-tenths like one parent and one-tenth like the other. It is\r\nthe same in grading live stock and this trait in breeding is of the\r\ngreatest advantage to the breeder of grade stock. If the calf takes\r\nafter the sire and the sire is a pure bred of strong type, the calf may\r\nbe nearly as strong in producing ability as the pure bred ancestors.\r\nOn the other hand, even pure bred cattle may breed back at times, and\r\ntheir offspring resemble some distant scrub member in the ancestry.\r\nBreeders are well aware of this fact and try very hard to keep all\r\ninferior cattle entirely eliminated from their line of breeding. It\r\nis important that they should for their line should breed as true as\r\npossible, and really poor calves with them are rare.\r\n\r\nThe pure bred bull of a long established type is more likely to\r\nmark his offspring than is the scrub cow. A fairly large per cent,\r\nconsiderably more than half, of the heifers will be good and some of\r\nthem nearly as good in milk production as the pure breds themselves.\r\nGrade cows are very valuable as milk producers, but grade bulls should\r\nnot be used as sires because they do not have the ability to breed true\r\nlike the pure bred.\r\n\r\nMost farmers have been in the habit of using a bull a couple of\r\nyears and then selling him to the butcher before his real worth was\r\ndiscovered. A bull’s ability to produce heifers that make good cows\r\ncan only be definitely told after his heifers have freshened and made\r\nrecords. Some of the best pure bred breeders in the United States will\r\nnot use a bull on their best cows until one hundred of his daughters\r\nare in the Advanced Registry which means that beginning at the age of\r\ntwo years they must produce 250.5 pounds of butter fat annually and\r\nmust increase the production to 360 pounds of butter fat at the age of\r\nfive years. In this way the best bulls are ascertained and are used to\r\nthe best advantage. But there is also a way for the average farmer to\r\nreceive the benefits of a good tested-out breeding stock at low cost.\r\nI refer to the co-operative bull associations and quote from Kimball’s\r\nDairy Farmer concerning them:\r\n\r\n“A co-operative bull association is a farmer’s organization whose\r\npurpose is the joint ownership, use, and exchange of three or more\r\nhigh-class pure bred bulls. The territory covered by the association\r\nis divided into three or more breeding blocks and a bull is stationed\r\nin each block for the service of the fifty or sixty cows in the block.\r\nEvery two years the bulls are interchanged. Thus, at a small cost, a\r\nbull for every sixty cows is provided for six or more years. The cost\r\nof bull service is greatly reduced, the best bulls obtained, and the\r\nbulls of outstanding merit are preserved for their entire period of\r\nusefulness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                             WHAT TO FEED\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Analysis.= The chemical analysis of feed does not by any\r\nmeans tell the whole story. Wheat straw, for instance shows up very\r\nwell in chemical analysis but experiments have shown that it takes\r\nmore energy to digest it than it produces. Even when we figure only\r\nthe digestible nutrients, the nutrients which by chemical analysis are\r\nfound to be digested by animals, we do not by any means have the whole\r\nstory. For instance, in human food we find that the protein in milk is\r\nabout four times as valuable as the protein in the bean. In the results\r\nof a feeding experiment reported in Dr. McCollum’s “Newer Knowledge of\r\nNutrition” on page 75, it was found that when the source of protein\r\nwas the bean, four times as much was required for maintaining the body\r\nweight of the animal as when the source of protein was milk. We used\r\nto figure protein as protein and carbohydrates as carbohydrates but\r\nnow we discriminate. We must learn to figure them in the results they\r\nproduce. This is extremely difficult to do scientifically. When an\r\nanimal must have a variety of feeds who can tell just what proportion\r\nof her production is due to certain foods eaten?\r\n\r\nWe can get at these things in a general way, however, by experience.\r\nFeeding has long been known as an art. Some day it may be entirely a\r\nscience. But that can not be said at the present time. We must vary\r\nthe feeds used and learn by experience and observation what gets the\r\nbest results. A chemical analysis of tender grass will not show it to\r\ncontain more digestive nutrients than the old tough grass that the cows\r\nwill hardly eat, but it requires much less energy to convert it into\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nOne year I listed some squaw corn about the tenth of July in a wheat\r\nstubble. By frost this corn was beginning to come into roasting ears.\r\nBut most of the ears had not developed kernels. I filled the silo from\r\nthis field and got, as nearly as I could ascertain, just as much milk\r\nfrom my herd by feeding that silage as by feeding silage made from\r\nmature corn containing considerable grain. The same amount of dry\r\ngrains were fed in both cases. According to analysis this result could\r\nnot possibly be obtained.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been tried in which the whole wheat plant, grain,\r\nstraw and all, also the oat plant and the corn plant were fed\r\nseparately to young heifers. The heifers fed the corn plant grew to\r\nmaturity and bore young normally. The heifers fed wheat and oats did\r\npoorly, produced their young prematurely, all but one of which died\r\nsoon after birth. This does not indicate that oat or wheat feeds are\r\nnot good for cattle, but in themselves they are not sufficient. I do\r\nnot think this deficiency can be shown in the chemical analysis but\r\nsome of the food elements are hard to get. I think if this wheat and\r\noat plant had been young and tender as a growing grass instead of a\r\nmature grain the heifers would have done well. Ground oats is one of\r\nthe best dairy feeds I ever tried.\r\n\r\n=Balanced Rations.= I do not know just to what extent a cow requires\r\na balanced ration. Since some feeds have values over others that the\r\nchemical analysis does not show, I think the balanced ration figures\r\nand tables have been overworked. They are not entirely valueless,\r\nhowever. Some will be placed in this book. Everyone knows that a cow\r\nshould not be fed one kind of feed only. We should give as great a\r\nvariety of feeds as possible and the cow’s likes and dislikes, together\r\nwith the results in the milk pail, give about all the information\r\nconcerning a balanced feed that the writer has ever used. We do not\r\nneed to worry about the supply of protein here because we use so much\r\nalfalfa, or about the carbohydrates when we are feeding the product of\r\nthe corn plant.\r\n\r\nA variation from a balanced ration does not immediately affect the\r\ncow and usually one change offsets another. Experienced feeders of\r\nrecord-making cattle make use of the chemical analysis of feeds in\r\ntheir intense effort to have the cow digest a very large amount of\r\nfood, yield a large amount of milk, and still keep her bodily weight\r\nabout normal. But for farm conditions we should know that too great an\r\namount of alfalfa, bran, and like feeds usually results in sleek, fat\r\ncattle and that cows fed principally corn and carbohydrates, if they\r\nare milking well, will look rather rough and get too thin. The writer\r\nat one time had alfalfa in such abundance that he let the milk herd\r\nrun out in the field and eat all they wanted from the stack. They had\r\nsilage and other feeds about as usual, but they did not eat as much\r\nsilage as they should have. The result was that the herd looked fine\r\nand thrifty but produced less milk.\r\n\r\nMany people think that a cow is either lean or fat and if she fills out\r\nin her body she is always taking on fat, but the amount of lean meat\r\non the body also varies. Protein feeds are muscle builders. They make\r\nanimals grow. Carbohydrates supply fat and energy which is a separate\r\nthing from muscle. Many times if cows become overweight we reduce the\r\ntotal amount of feed consumed and get a large yield in the milk pail.\r\n“The eye of the feeder fattens his cattle.” It also fills the milk\r\npail. Scientific knowledge can help a good feeder but I doubt very much\r\nif it alone can make one. Rules and system can not be made to take the\r\nplace of interest and attention.\r\n\r\nFor those who care to go thoroughly into the subject of feeding I\r\nrecommend “How to Feed the Dairy Cow,” by Hugh Van Pelt, Editor of\r\nKimball’s Dairy Farmer, Waterloo, Iowa.\r\n\r\nI have referred those who wish to go deeply into the subject of feeds\r\nto more eminent authorities because I have never raced cows in a record\r\ncontest and am not an authority on the subject. The reason I have for\r\nwriting is that I have viewed the subject from the standpoint of profit\r\nmaking rather than that of high production. Feeding for profit has been\r\ntoo little considered.\r\n\r\n=Pastures.= The way that pastures are generally used is, in my opinion,\r\nthe greatest mistake in the milk business. Certainly we can make two\r\nblades of grass grow where one blade of grass and one weed grew before.\r\nMost of the pastures that we see are either bare like a desert or weedy\r\nenough to hide a calf three months old. A cow can not get enough feed\r\nin the average pasture, no matter how many acres she mows over. There\r\nis no need to estimate how many acres of poor pasture a cow requires,\r\nbut one acre of well-cared for pasture per cow is all the writer has\r\never had to use. While I have fed a small amount of alfalfa in the\r\nsummer, I think it is safe to say that our cows had more grass per head\r\nthan almost any cows in the county. Next year I expect to pasture fifty\r\ncows on thirty acres, feeding what is necessary in addition. I expect\r\nto get nearly enough grass in a reasonably good year for that number of\r\ncows.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the system lies in the fact that I have the pasture\r\ndivided into four parts and pasture one part at a time, then use a\r\nmowing machine to clip off all weeds or remaining grass close to the\r\nground. Before turning the cattle into one of these pastures, I wait\r\nuntil the grass has had about four weeks to grow. If the grass gives\r\nout, the cow is given enough feed to make up the difference. I do not\r\nlet the grass stay short, for if it stays short, the roots will also be\r\nshort and in that condition it can not withstand drought. Any kind of\r\ngrass will yield two or three times as much feed per acre, if allowed\r\nto grow a month at a time as it will if pastured off short all of the\r\ntime. I let the cattle eat the grass off the pasture about as often as\r\nalfalfa is cut. Everyone knows that if they would cut their alfalfa\r\nevery three days they would have hardly a hat full of hay at the end\r\nof the season. I aim to mow the pasture about the time that the cattle\r\nare taken out, for I do not want any old, tough grass for the next time\r\nthat the cattle are turned into it.\r\n\r\nMuch of our pasture is a mixture of blue grass, timothy and sweet\r\nclover with the sweet clover predominating. I do not want to place too\r\nmuch reliance on shallow rooting grasses, such as white clover and\r\nblue grass, although I have some pasture of that kind. I like to have\r\nabout five acres of sorghum or Sudan grass to pasture once about the\r\nfirst of August and then again about the second week in September.\r\n\r\nSweet clover will root about four feet deep. Alfalfa will root much\r\ndeeper but is not practical as a pasture. Blue grass and white clover,\r\nespecially where cropped off short, root very shallow. Sudan grass will\r\ndraw moisture three or four feet deep. Sudan grass is like sorghum and\r\nmay at some time turn poison late in the fall, as far as I know, but\r\nI know people who use it regularly for pasture and have never had any\r\nsuch trouble. I have never pastured Sudan grass but have used sorghum,\r\nand have had no bad results. To get the most out of pasture we must\r\nhave all the surface available for use and we must give the plant an\r\nopportunity to breathe in order that it may root as deep as possible,\r\nand then we should use deep rooting grasses such as sweet clover and\r\nSudan grass or sorghum.\r\n\r\nIn getting at the value of pastures be sure to remember that the\r\ncow goes out to harvest the crop. I do not think that pasture is an\r\nexpensive feed. It is probably the cheapest feed we can get all things\r\nconsidered, when properly managed.\r\n\r\n=Hay.= Four tons of alfalfa hay contain more nutrients than ten tons\r\nof silage, and hay is cheaper to raise and cheaper to harvest. The\r\nintensive dairy farmer makes alfalfa hay form as large a part of his\r\nration as practical, for a certain variety is needed. However, figuring\r\nalfalfa as against corn fodder, the fodder is the cheaper under average\r\nconditions. The by-product farmer will do well to use as little alfalfa\r\nas he can and still get good results.\r\n\r\nThe principal value in alfalfa hay for cattle feeding is in the leaves\r\nand the results obtained are so dependent upon the kind of hay we get\r\nthat we consider that part of the secret of feeding lies in putting up\r\nthe hay. It has been demonstrated by Headdon of the Colorado Experiment\r\nStation that where alfalfa is put up by the most careful method, three\r\nhundred and fifty pounds of leaves are lost for every ton of hay put\r\nup. Where alfalfa is carelessly handled and most of the leaves fall\r\noff, we lose as much as three thousand pounds of leaves for every ton\r\nof hay put up, and the hay that remains is of very little value so far\r\nas milk cows are concerned. Not only do we lose the leaves of alfalfa\r\nbut we can lose the food value out of the leaf very easily. The alfalfa\r\nleaf is very easily digested and the nutrients so easily digested are\r\nleached out by rain. They even leave the plant when it is bleached in\r\nthe sun. The stem of the alfalfa has some value, however, if it is\r\ncut young enough to be tender. Old, woody stems will show well in a\r\nchemical test but will show poorly in a profit test on a dairy farm.\r\n\r\nWe can judge the feeding value of alfalfa by its color. Well-cured hay\r\nshould be pea-green, without must and not dusty. We get more alfalfa\r\nby raking it soon after it is mowed, and by curing it in windrows or\r\nin shocks, than if we let it remain spread out to bleach in the sun.\r\nBesides curing hay in the shock, I have seen another method used and\r\ngood results obtained where the barn was very large in proportion to\r\nthe amount of hay put in it. Hay was hauled in from the field very\r\ngreen and dumped by slings along the center of the barn without being\r\ntramped. After several days it is spread. The heated hay, when lifted\r\nup in the air and piled up loose, cools off rapidly, the heat helping\r\ngreatly to dry off the moisture. Such hay will not heat again and it\r\nretains its color.\r\n\r\nI do not think there is any other grass so valuable for hay as is\r\nalfalfa. Before we had alfalfa we used cane and millet. Sweet clover is\r\nfavored by some. It is about the same as alfalfa chemically, and I do\r\nnot doubt that it makes a good hay if not allowed to get woody. I have\r\nnever used sweet clover as hay. Sudan grass is a sorghum and has come\r\ninto some favor. It has about the same food value, however, as the corn\r\nstalk which the farmer already has available.\r\n\r\n=Corn Fodder.= There are thousands of acres of corn stalks being\r\npastured in Nebraska and Iowa that have not much more value as they\r\nstand in the field than the dead grass by the roadside. Saved and\r\nutilized they are the great source of wealth that as yet is almost\r\nuntouched. Their yield is like a low-grade ore found in abundance.\r\nDry fodder containing no grain is worth at least half as much per ton\r\nas alfalfa and the yield is approximately two tons per acre. I say it\r\nis worth half as much but I have to guess at it. It contains just as\r\nmany pounds of digestible nutrients per ton as alfalfa and more than\r\nprairie hay. How much it is worth depends largely upon the conditions\r\nunder which it is fed. It costs no more to cut and shock fodder than to\r\nhusk a field of corn. Cutting up the fodder and husking out the ears\r\nby machine is not an expensive operation. Remember that hay must be\r\nbrought in from the field. The entire cost of cut fodder for feeding\r\ncan fairly be figured as about the cost of operating the machine that\r\ndoes the cutting and husking. It is the cheapest feed that we can get.\r\n\r\nMany years ago there were several large corn shredding machines sold\r\nthroughout this territory. They husked the corn and shredded the fodder\r\nbut they did not prove a success because fodder, unless unusually dry,\r\ngets musty if cut up fine with an ensilage cutter and piled up. The new\r\nand really successful way of handling fodder is with a small machine\r\nthat runs with a small gasoline engine. A supply of fodder should be\r\ncut up every ten days or two weeks until a time comes when the fodder\r\nis real dry--not earlier than December. Then the job may be finished\r\nand the feed will last indefinitely.\r\n\r\n=Silage Without Corn.= Some feeders put this cut-up fodder in a silo as\r\nsoon as the corn is dry enough to keep in the crib. They run water in\r\nwith it and all reports seem to agree that it makes a good silage. I\r\nhave not tried this, but I hope the scheme has in it the final solution\r\nof the problem. Silo agents have been in the habit of arguing that\r\nyou can afford to feed silage, corn and all, to all of the stock on\r\nthe place and let the corn stalks that are not put into the silo go\r\nto waste. I do not agree with them. Instead of putting fifteen acres\r\nof corn in the silo where much of it is to be fed to young stock and\r\nhorses, use twenty or even twenty-five acres of stalks alone and you\r\nwill get just about as good results. But think of the saving. The corn\r\nstalks are a by-product. You had to farm so many acres to get them. A\r\npart of your business is raising corn and the stalks are paid for by\r\nthe grain.\r\n\r\nSuppose then you feed grain grown on five acres of land. You are using\r\njust one-third of the acres to feed your cattle that would be used if\r\nyou had put in fifteen acres of corn and fed it, corn and all. This\r\nshows the advantages of the by-product producer. It fills in the big\r\ngap that has been forgotten. It is figuring on a cost basis rather than\r\nthat of yield or speed in production.\r\n\r\nLast winter a feeding experiment was tried at the Wisconsin Experiment\r\nStation in which corn silage with grain in was tested against silage\r\nfrom which the corn had been picked. The result showed that the cows\r\nate slightly more silage when it contained the grain and yielded on\r\nan average three pounds more milk. The cost of the milk produced with\r\nand without the grain in the silage was exactly the same. Silage was\r\nfigured at $6.50 per ton, corn and all, and without grain at $4.00.\r\nSince the average farmer has cornstalks to waste and only has to figure\r\nthe cost of saving them, they should not be figured at nearly two\r\nthirds of the corn crop, even after they have been made into silage.\r\n\r\nHowever, it usually pays to feed grain to cows that are milking. The\r\nmain saving in the use of husked fodder lies in getting cheaper feed\r\nfor growing young stock and feeding dry cows.\r\n\r\nI recommend a system of feeding silage, corn and all, to producing\r\ncows only. If you do not have cows enough to prepare to feed them\r\nseparately, it will pay better to use no silos that have grain in them\r\nat all. Feed the grain to those cows only that are giving milk and will\r\npay for it, or the cattle that you are fattening. Hold the rest of the\r\ngrain for high prices. It will pay better.\r\n\r\n=Silage.= The important thing about a silo is to make it tall enough\r\nand small enough around. The following dimensions are approximately\r\ncorrect:\r\n\r\n  For 12 to 15 cows, silo should be 10 feet in diameter\r\n  For 20 to 30 cows, silo should be 12 feet in diameter\r\n  For 30 to 40 cows, silo should be 14 feet in diameter\r\n  For 40 to 60 cows, silo should be 16 feet in diameter\r\n\r\nSilage will spoil on top unless at least two inches are fed off each\r\nday. It usually pays to have several small silos rather than one big\r\none because during the summer months you may want to feed only a part\r\nof a ration. The figures given are for full rations. Have the silo air\r\ntight. Cut the corn fine and put lots of effort on tamping it. The\r\n“Flink’s Perfect Silo Seal” is a canvas that is treated with some kind\r\nof tar preparation. It spreads out over the top of the silo and is\r\nfilled more than a foot deep with water. This weighs down the silage\r\nand makes a good air tight cover. Very little silage decays under it.\r\nWith such a cover you can feed periodically and still lose hardly a\r\nday’s feeding of silage.\r\n\r\n=Grain Feed.= Grain should be fed mixed with other feeds. I have often\r\nbeen told how foolish was the old idea of the cow losing her cud.\r\nBut a cow can hardly re-gurgitate and re-chew grain by itself, and\r\nall food eaten by a cow should be re-chewed. If food passes into the\r\nintestines without being chewed a second time, it is likely to sour\r\nand cause scouring and loss of appetite or even death, when a large\r\namount of grain has been consumed. We usually feed grains with silage\r\nor fine-cut alfalfa. Alfalfa run through an ensilage cutter without any\r\nre-cutting attachment, is said to make cows’ mouths sore, but I would\r\nmuch prefer to feed it that way and risk sore mouths than to risk the\r\ngrain by itself. Some farmers feed corn and cob-meal. The cob is of no\r\nvalue except to lighten the ration, but if there is nothing else to\r\ndilute the grain with, by all means use the cob. Oats, corn, hominy\r\nfeed, which is a by-product in the manufacturing of corn meal, bran,\r\nwhich is not very valuable where plenty of alfalfa is fed, and oil meal\r\nform our principal feeds for dairy cows. Some get very good results by\r\nfeeding ground speltz and barley, others by feeding ground rye. Corn,\r\noats, wheat feeds and oil meal will generally form the main part of our\r\nration. The average farmer is hardly warranted in looking farther for\r\ngrains to feed. Oil meal helps as a conditioner and is fed in small\r\namounts only. Cottonseed meal may be of value but has never proven so\r\nin the writer’s personal experience.\r\n\r\nGrain should be ground so that all of the nutriments may be absorbed.\r\nThe amount of grain to be fed varies with the amount of milk that the\r\ncow is producing. One pound of grain to every five pounds of milk is\r\na fairly good rule to follow. If more grain is fed there should be\r\nanother reason for it, and that is that the cow readily responds to\r\nmore feeding and makes sufficient profit to pay for the extra grain.\r\nThe old rule, in the main, is true that it takes a certain amount to\r\nmaintain bodily weight of the animal, and that the more feed above the\r\nmaintenance ration that she can consume and turn into milk, the more\r\nthe profit. But even that rule should not be taken too literally. If\r\nthe extra feed is all grain, it may be too expensive.\r\n\r\n=Prepared Feeds.= There are many kinds of prepared feeds on the market\r\nand I have no right either to knock or to boost them, because I know\r\npractically nothing about them. Where there are combination feeds,\r\nintended to make a balanced ration, I think the farmer would very\r\nlikely be paying a good deal for the combining. Where a mill man\r\nbuys grain from farmers and from those grains prepares feeds that are\r\nnot by-products of other milling operations, I think the price would\r\nbe high. I have known farmers to sell alfalfa hay and buy alfalfa\r\nmeal, but I do not think it pays to do those things. All I would say\r\nconcerning prepared feeds would be to experiment carefully and to buy\r\nthem, not on their guaranteed chemical analysis, but on what results\r\nthey actually show in the milk pail. Some prepared feeds contain oat\r\nhulls which are about like wheat straw to digest. Dried sugar beet pulp\r\nis a by-product feed containing mostly carbohydrates, and seems to have\r\nsome benefit as an appetizer. Cattle like it for a change. Where it is\r\nnot too high and carbohydrate rough feeds are to be purchased, it might\r\nbe profitable to try it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                              HOW TO FEED\r\n\r\n\r\n=Balanced Ration.= Cattle like variety in their feed. Not all cattle\r\nhave the same tastes and desires. When one cow refuses to eat her\r\ngrain, it is well to try her on some other mixture. A good feeder\r\nusually has several grain feeds on hand at a time and is continually\r\nchanging and trying out rations. By checking his results at the pail,\r\nhe acquires knowledge that is more practical than any chemist can\r\nimpart. We know that a cow’s food must contain the necessary elements\r\nneeded for her bodily maintenance and the production of milk. We must\r\nsupply the substances needed. Rules for figuring values of feeds and\r\nexamples of balanced rations are given below, but we also let the cow\r\nin on the discussion. We should not follow rules so closely that we\r\nignore her likes and dislikes or overlook the results that she puts in\r\nthe milk pail and the pocket book. There is probably no living creature\r\nthat has for its natural diet a balanced ration, unless it be a\r\ncarnivorous animal that eats its prey whole--feathers and all.\r\n\r\nA poorly balanced diet may be fed for several months before any\r\nresults begin to show. Cattle do fairly well on the corn plant (mainly\r\ncarbohydrates), and they also do well on pure alfalfa (a protein feed).\r\nThey do better on a combination of the two, but the combination does\r\nnot have to be in just the right proportion. In deciding what to feed a\r\ncow the good feeder uses his eyes more than his pencil. If the muscle\r\nand body of the animal needs building up, he uses protein feeds in\r\nlarge proportions. Cattle inclined to be too sleek and fat often milk\r\nbetter if fed more carbohydrates in proportion. But we should never\r\npass up one or the other completely. Notice that I speak of only two\r\nsubstances in food--protein and carbohydrates. There are others, but we\r\nneed not be concerned about them. All we want to know from the chemist\r\nis approximately the amount of these two elements the feed contains.\r\nFat is considered the same as a carbohydrate but has more than two\r\ntimes the value of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nDairy cows should be kept sleek and thrifty, but lean while they\r\nare producing milk. The dry cow should be allowed to get as fat as\r\npossible, for the fatter and more thrifty she is the more milk she will\r\ngive, after freshening. To maintain the cow in the right condition, we\r\nconsider both the kind and the amount of feed. Many times we decrease\r\nthe grain ration to keep a cow from getting fat and going dry too soon.\r\nToo much grain fed is a great waste. The right amount to be fed can not\r\nbe figured so much by the size of the cow as by what she does with it.\r\nThe milk pail contains the answer to most feeding problems. Increase\r\nthe feed slightly and if no more milk is produced, begin to decrease\r\nand watch what happens. We have to do this for each cow just as we have\r\nto adjust the carburetor on a Ford.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this book, I discuss pastures and how to make the most of\r\nthem. I get grass that is tall enough for the cattle to eat to the best\r\nadvantage and I keep it from getting old and tough by using the system\r\nof divided pastures described there. But in doing this, the grass must\r\nbe pastured off fairly close before turning the cattle into the next\r\npasture. If care is not taken, the cattle are having alternately a\r\nfeast and a famine by the change. To offset this, I usually feed as\r\nmuch good alfalfa as the cows will eat all of the time. It does not\r\nrequire much hay but it makes up for the variation in pasture. Even\r\nwhen on fine pasture, cows like a little hay and should have it. I\r\nusually pasture cows at night as well as during the day. By all means\r\nfeed cows at night if they are required to stay in the lot.\r\n\r\nWhere the heaviest records are made in milk production, they are nearly\r\nall made at prohibitive costs so far as the value of the product is\r\nconcerned. This is because too large a proportion of the feed consumed\r\nis high priced. We must take into consideration the price of grain,\r\nthe price of rough feed, and the price of milk products, before we can\r\ndetermine the proportion of grain and other feed that should be given\r\nto the dairy cow.\r\n\r\nWe can make milk out of rough feed without any grain under the proper\r\nconditions. When grain is too much out of proportion in price, we can\r\nsafely do without it, if our rough feed happens to be good pasture or\r\ngood alfalfa hay and silage. If our roughage is too poor, it rarely\r\npays to compel good dairy cows to live on it alone, for their future\r\nusefulness will be impaired by starvation. A drought in summer with the\r\nresulting short pasture often knocks down the milk flow for all of the\r\nnext winter and makes all that year’s production more expensive. Starve\r\na good cow and she soon becomes a poor one, for she must adjust herself\r\nto the new condition. The new condition she adopts is the same as that\r\nof the scrub. The scrub is a product of starvation. She has been bred\r\nto withstand hardships instead of using all efforts to produce milk.\r\nNever let a good cow go hungry for pasture or hay.\r\n\r\n=Water.= A milk cow requires about twelve and one-half gallons of pure\r\nwater per day. In summer it should be fresh and cool water. In winter\r\nit should be fairly warm. The water should be as accessible as possible\r\nat all times. Twice a day is not often enough for milk cows. Especially\r\nwhen cattle are on dry feed, the more water they can be induced to\r\nconsume, the more butter fat and milk solids it will put into the pail.\r\nIn the winter we usually water cows three times a day in the barn with\r\nwater no colder than comes from the well, and slightly salt their feed\r\nso that they will drink water in abundance. I do not know just what\r\neffect stagnant, dirty water has on a milk cow, but do not think I\r\nwould want to drink the milk that is made up largely of such water.\r\nAlso if cattle wade in infected water and get their udders and teats in\r\nit, the milk will to a certain extent be infected as is the water.\r\n\r\n=Calf and Heifer Feeding.= In raising calves by hand there is more\r\ndanger of overfeeding than of underfeeding. There is also danger in\r\nfeeding milk that is too cold. In feeding an average young calf we\r\nusually take about two quarts of the first milk that is drawn from the\r\ncow, which is low in butter fat, and feed the milk fresh and warm with\r\nthe animal heat in it. After three weeks, skim milk may be substituted\r\nespecially if it is warm and fresh. If the milk is artificially\r\nwarmed it should be fed at a temperature of at least eighty degrees.\r\nDo not dilute milk with water. Let the calf have what water it wants\r\nseparately. A calf should have milk until at least three months old\r\nbut at the end of a week it will eat shelled corn and oats. These\r\ngrains should be fed liberally to calves that do not have enough milk\r\nfor a complete ration. After a calf is one month old it may be raised\r\non milk made from dried buttermilk or condensed buttermilk or on skim\r\nmilk of any kind, provided it is not fed too much at a time nor fed\r\nmilk that is too cold. No changes such as from sweet milk to sour\r\nmilk should be made suddenly. If feeding condensed buttermilk the milk\r\nafter being diluted should be tested for solids with a lactometer. Some\r\nmanufacturers of such products give directions for reducing it with\r\nwater to such an extent that it would look like ordinary skim milk\r\nbut have only half its value. This may make it appear that the feeder\r\nis getting a lot for his money, but he will not long be fooled by\r\ndirections of that kind if he is watching the cost of his feed and the\r\ngrowth of his calves and knows what results he should expect for his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes tell of stunted calves that turned out to be good\r\ncows but I do not think that a calf can be stunted a minute without\r\nbeing affected. If a stunted calf makes a good cow, which seldom ever\r\nhappens, certain it is that if the calf had been well nourished the cow\r\nwould have been even greater. Animals do not grow all of their lives.\r\nThey grow while they are young. Every minute of that youth period that\r\nwe lose for growth is lost forever. Growth is the natural development\r\nof bone, muscle, nervous system, circulation, etc., that the animal\r\nneeds for hard work when mature. Breeders of pure bred cattle, who\r\nexpect to make records with their young stock, feed them grain every\r\nday. I do not think this is necessary or practical for the farmer to\r\ndo, but certain it is, that no promising heifer should ever be allowed\r\nto get thin. She should have good pasture during all of the summer and\r\nshould have plenty of well-cured feed, corn fodder or corn silage, and\r\na fair amount of alfalfa every day during the winter.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Analysis.= A chemical analysis of some of the most commonly\r\nused feeds for dairy cows follows:\r\n\r\n                      Total Dry     Digestive Nutrients in 100 lbs.\r\n  FEEDING STUFF       Matter in    Crude   Carbohydrates\r\n                       100 lbs.

I copied from the records\r\nthe amount of feed she consumed in a year and the amount of her\r\nproduction. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n                   Feed                      Returns\r\n                lbs.                lbs.              lbs.\r\n  Corn          1790  Beets         9645  Milk      26,721.5\r\n  Oil Meal      1352  Dried beet          Butter     1,066\r\n  Barley         463     pulp       1254\r\n  Bran          2312  Hay           4068\r\n  Oats           498  Silage        4680\r\n                ----              ------\r\n    Total       6452    Total     19,647\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that she consumed a little less than 18 pounds\r\nof grain per day on an average throughout the year, that the grain\r\nconsisted of five varieties, and that the rough feed was of a high\r\norder, which makes it more expensive than most of us can afford to use\r\nas a regular feed. Beets are chemically about equal to corn silage, but\r\nin actual results in feeding they are considerably superior. I have not\r\nfed dried beet pulp, but I have fed it fresh and it is a very good milk\r\nproducer. Cows milk down thin on it. If we would increase the figures\r\non the dried beet pulp to what it would be if the pulp were fed fresh,\r\nit would bring the beet ration up to at least three times the amount of\r\nthe silage ration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                        VARIATION IN MILK TESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nG. W. Shaw in Hoard’s Dairyman of March 10, 1916 says:\r\n\r\n“It is a well-known fact that the percentage of butter fat in the\r\nmilk of cows increases very materially toward the end of a period of\r\nlactation. There are also other slight changes in that period. During\r\nthe first month the fat generally averages higher than during the\r\nsecond month. Under normal conditions of feed, etc., the fat increases\r\nfrom the third or fourth month to the end of lactation.\r\n\r\n“Although it is a fact that cows cannot be fed to give beyond a certain\r\npercentage of butterfat, yet it has been proven many times that if\r\npoorly fed for a considerable length of time, the average test will\r\ndecrease. This is especially true if cows become thin and poor in\r\nflesh. Many times this will account for a farmer’s average herd test\r\ndropping from one period to the next. It is also noticeable that the\r\nquantity of water taken, whether as water or succulent feed, affects\r\nthe herd. This is particularly noticeable when cows are changed from a\r\ndiet of dry hay to green feed or vice versa.\r\n\r\n“It has been noted that the change of weather affects the test. A\r\nsudden cold period coming will usually decrease the quantity of milk,\r\nbut increase the percentage of fat. If the cold period continues,\r\nthis change will tend to right itself. It would seem that there is a\r\nconnection between the question of heat and cold and the amount of\r\nwater taken.\r\n\r\n“It is a well-known fact that the first milk drawn from a cow’s udder\r\nis very low in butterfat, not over 1%, whereas the last drawn is quite\r\nhigh, sometimes reaching 10%. The importance of exhaustive milking is\r\nevident. By carefully milking to the fullest extent each time, the test\r\nwill undoubtedly be higher than if milking were not exhaustive. This,\r\ncontinued over a period of time, would have its effect on the 15-day\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n“Another very important point we wish to make is this, unless a man who\r\ndoes his testing at home understands how to do it thoroughly and is\r\nvery careful in taking his sample, he will not check with the factory\r\ntest. There are several reasons for differences between tests made\r\non samples taken at the farm and those made on samples taken at the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n“Many farmers have a habit of taking a little cream or top milk for\r\nfamily use, and think that it will not materially affect the average\r\ntest. As a matter of fact it will affect materially. For instance, if a\r\nfarmer were producing 100 pounds of milk testing 3.5% and he used one\r\nquart of top milk, testing 10%, his average test would be reduced .2 of\r\n1%; that is, instead of delivering milk testing 3.5% it would actually\r\ntest 3.3%.\r\n\r\n“Some farmers adopt another method; they use, for family purposes the\r\nmilk from a cow which gives the richest milk, so that the result is\r\nalways the same, the average test being lower.\r\n\r\n“Another cause of difference in tests, and we think this is a very\r\nimportant one, is found in the condition of the milk when received\r\nat the factory. Some farmer’s milk, when brought in, is smooth and\r\nhomogeneous; some bring in milk which is slightly churned; that is,\r\nthere are small particles of butter, which is separated butterfat\r\nfloating on the surface. This latter milk is very hard to sample; the\r\nsampler is plunged into the milk and is likely to miss a due proportion\r\nof these floating particles. In addition, some of the separated\r\nbutterfat is sure to be left behind, both on the sides of can and on\r\nthe cover. Butterfat adheres to any surface much more rapidly than\r\nany other of the milk solids. It is quite evident that milk which is\r\npartially churned will get a lower test at the factory than it did at\r\nthe farm before it became churned.\r\n\r\n“In order to prevent this churning, it is most important that the milk\r\nbe quickly and thoroughly cooled after milking. If milk is poured into\r\ncans and stirred and handled in a half warm condition, it is sure to\r\nseparate to some extent. While the particles of butterfat are not large\r\nenough to be particularly noticeable, they are there and adhere to the\r\nsurfaces as described.\r\n\r\n“Another condition which causes trouble in sampling, is found where\r\nsome of the cream is firm and floats around in hard lumps but is not\r\nchurned. This kind of cream is also hard to sample and these lumps are\r\nliable to be left behind on the sides of the can and cover. We believe\r\nthis condition is caused by allowing milk to cool spontaneously. That\r\nis, instead of cooling quickly, the farmer fills up his milk can and\r\nlets it stand to cool slowly. This is liable to give a hard cream on\r\nthe surface which does not break up readily. The farmer, therefore,\r\nwill get a better test by =cooling his milk quickly and thoroughly and\r\nrefraining from using the top milk for family use=.\r\n\r\n“We have come to this conclusion, namely, that certain conditions\r\naffect cows and their work, the same as that of human beings. As\r\nsomeone has said: ‘Put yourself in a cow’s place and try to get\r\nher point of view. Could you do good work if a swarm of flies were\r\nbothering you all the time? What effect does an extremely warm day or\r\ntwo have on your capacity for work? If you were out in a cold, rain,\r\nand wind storm, how would it affect your work? Suppose you were thirsty\r\nand had to wait two or three hours before you could get a drink and\r\nthen got foul and stagnant water? Or, suppose that someone stronger\r\nthan yourself would chase you away from the shade or sheltered spot or\r\nforced you to move when you were resting or eating? Suppose you were\r\nforced to eat food that you did not like or enjoy? How long would it be\r\nbefore these things would show in your work? Any or all of them would\r\nimpair your efficiency and lessen your ability.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                 SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING A BARN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince there is so much information available concerning construction\r\nof barns, it is not necessary for me to discuss it here except to\r\ncriticize the standard forms. On most farms at hay-making time there\r\nis no time to haul hay to the dairy barn so it is stacked in the field\r\nand hauled in during the winter. Many large dairy barn hay mows are\r\nconstructed at a great deal of expense and stand empty most of the time\r\nin this climate. Before building large, expensive barns it might be\r\nwell to consult those who have built to see how they are getting along.\r\nOn an average farm I would suggest a one story shed for the cows built\r\nas a lean-to or butting up against a hay shed. This hay shed need not\r\nbe very large.\r\n\r\nIn most expensive barns there is installed a litter-carrier that runs\r\non a track. If I were going to use a litter-carrier at all I would have\r\nthe thing so that it could be let down below the level of the gutter\r\nand shove the manure down the gutter into it. This means would save\r\nall the liquid manure which is more valuable and would save the effort\r\nrequired to lift the manure with a shovel. When full the carrier could\r\nbe hoisted, run on the track, and dumped into the wagon or wherever\r\ndesired. But why use a carrier? Why not have the gutters run through\r\nthe side of the barn and a wagon or manure spreader standing beneath?\r\nIt is very easy to push the manure from ten cows down the gutter. Two\r\ngutters could run into one wagon which would be left standing outside\r\nof the barn on lower ground. The barn could either stand on a side hill\r\nor a place could be dug to run the wagon into. If hogs are to work over\r\nthe manure, a concrete basin should be constructed to hold it.\r\n\r\nThe feed trough should be so made that it may be used to water the cows\r\nduring cold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                                MILKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cow’s milk is partly manufactured in the udder at the time it is\r\nbeing drawn. The process is like digestion and is interfered with by\r\nany nervous tension or shock. The prick of a pin that will make a\r\ncow jump at the time of milking has been known to greatly reduce the\r\nbutterfat of the milk given and at the same time to reduce the supply.\r\nShepherd dogs that go after cows are likely to perform their labor at\r\na very high cost in milk. A milk stool used as a weapon knocks a lot\r\nof money out of the farmer’s pocket. A rough milker who irritates a\r\ncow causes much trouble also. If I were to judge a dairyman by just\r\none thing I could tell most about him by noticing how well the cows\r\nliked to have him milk them. Where a cow has to dance to the jerking of\r\nrough hands and listen to profanity of the milker, that is plenty of\r\ninformation to decide that on that farm dairying does not pay. There\r\nare few cows that will treat a milker any better than he treats them.\r\n\r\nFor sanitary reasons I do not believe in milking with wet hands, but\r\nif a cow’s udder is caked, the best cure that I know is to draw the\r\nmilk into the hands very slowly and rub it into the caked udder until\r\nit is absorbed through the skin. I do not know or care why, but there\r\nis something about a cow’s milk that is good for her caked udder when\r\napplied to the outside. One treatment of an hour’s duration, milking\r\nthe milk a stream at a time and working it into the caked udder, is\r\noften sufficient to cure even bad cases. Cow’s teats should never be\r\nallowed to get sore, for clean milk can not be produced from sore,\r\nbleeding teats. It may be necessary to apply antiseptic medicines when\r\nthey are sore, but a good way to keep the teats soft and pliable so the\r\ncow will not be irritated by milking is to take the last streams or two\r\nin the udder, milk it into the hand and use it to rub into the teat.\r\nThe solids in the last streams of milk are about one-half butterfat and\r\nthis greases the teat with the best kind of grease that I know.\r\n\r\nHaving employed a great many men on the farm I have found from\r\nexperience that two out of three do not know how to milk. Of these,\r\nsome can be taught but many are not worth bothering with. Many are too\r\nrough and many do not seem to be able to get all the milk from the\r\nudder. To get all the milk from one quarter of the udder the milker\r\nshould use both hands, using one hand above the teat to squeeze the\r\nmilk into the teat and with the other hand milk it into the pail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                             MILK PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery milk producer should make some study of the principal products\r\nthat are made from milk, for such information may help to market it to\r\na better advantage.\r\n\r\n=Butter.= The law requires that butter contain 80% butter-fat and that\r\nit shall contain less than 16% moisture. In 100 pounds of creamery\r\nbutter there is usually about 3 pounds of salt, 1 pound of casein and\r\nbetween 15 and 16 pounds of water.\r\n\r\nFiguring that butter contains 80% fat for the minimum which allows for\r\nthe maximum amount of water, the following amount may be obtained from\r\n100 pounds of milk:\r\n\r\n  100 lbs. of 3% milk will produce 3³⁄₄  lbs. of butter.\r\n  100 lbs. of 4% milk will produce 5     lbs. of butter.\r\n  100 lbs. of 5% milk will produce 6¹⁄₄  lbs. of butter.\r\n\r\n=Cheese.= It usually takes about 10 pounds of 4% milk to make 1 pound\r\nof cheddar cheese, which is the common cheese usually sold at the\r\nstores. This cheese will test out about 36.8% fat, 25.5% protein, 6%\r\nsugar, ash, etc., and 31.7% water.\r\n\r\n=Cottage Cheese.= Cottage cheese is usually made from skim milk. 100\r\npounds of average skim milk will make from 12 to 15 pounds of cottage\r\ncheese, such as is usually sold on the city market. Where it is creamed\r\nthe cream is put in after the cheese is made.\r\n\r\n=Cream.= 100 pounds of 4% milk will produce: 20 pounds of 20% cream\r\nand 80 pounds of skim remaining, 13¹⁄₃ pounds of 30% cream and 86²⁄₃\r\nlbs. of skim remaining, or 10 pounds of 40% cream and 90 pounds of skim\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\nThe average cream sold tests about 30% butter-fat, so on the average\r\nthe farmer has left about 86 pounds or a ten-gallon can of skim milk\r\nfor every 100 pounds of 4% milk.\r\n\r\n=Skim Milk.= The value of skim milk on the farm as feed is an important\r\none for the farmer. The price of whole milk in the city is not always\r\nhigh enough so that it pays the farmer to sell his skim rather than to\r\nuse it for feeding. During the flush season in the spring when milk\r\ndealers are all burdened with a surplus of milk, it would be a great\r\nadvantage if more farmers would separate and feed the skim milk to\r\nhogs. I will endeavor to give here as accurately as possible what real\r\ninformation I can gather from Experiment Station reports concerning the\r\nfeeding value of skim milk. At the outset it might be well to state\r\nthat on this question I have never known any two agricultural experts\r\nto agree and experiments need to be carefully analyzed before they\r\nyield true information.\r\n\r\nI can prove to you from experiments published in Henry & Morrison’s\r\n“Feeds and Feeding” that skim milk is worth only $.08 a hundred pounds\r\nwhen corn meal is worth $1.00 a hundred, and I can prove that skim milk\r\nis worth $.31 a hundred pounds when corn meal is worth $1.00 a hundred.\r\nIn fact when an experimenter undertakes to prove a thing he has very\r\neasy sailing if he can line up conditions to suit the proposition he\r\nintends to prove. The trouble with most experiments on this subject\r\nhas been that they are apparently planned to be used as arguments for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the feeding of skim milk and they do not\r\nundertake to solve the real question involved.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that corn alone is too unbalanced a ration to feed to\r\nhogs profitably. Where it is endeavored to show that skim milk has a\r\nvery high value, one bunch of hogs is fed corn alone, and to compare\r\nwith it another bunch is fed corn and a small amount of skim milk. Let\r\nthose who are satisfied with the information that can be obtained by\r\nsuch an experiment use it and I will have no dispute with them. But for\r\nmost of us the question is whether we should feed alfalfa to the cow\r\nand the cow’s milk to the pig or let the pig eat his own alfalfa. A\r\nhog’s ration may be balanced with alfalfa hay or with alfalfa or rape\r\npasture. The question is whether milk and corn makes as cheap a gain\r\nas alfalfa and corn. It is very difficult to find experiments that\r\nanswer this question and it is the most practical one in the world. If\r\nit is good sense to use the cost of producing pork on dry corn alone\r\nas the basis of getting at the value of milk, it is also good sense to\r\nuse skim milk alone as the basis of figuring the value of grain. In an\r\nexperiment published by Henry & Morrison on page 597, where little pigs\r\nweighing only twenty-five pounds were used and which are capable of\r\nmaking cheaper gains on milk than older hogs because they have smaller\r\nbodies to maintain, it took 2,739 pounds of skim milk to make one\r\nhundred pounds of gain. But where 233 pounds of grain were fed with\r\n935 pounds of skim milk there was also a gain of one hundred pounds.\r\nFiguring now as they do who would set the value of milk by the cost\r\nof feeding dry grain, we will use skim milk as a basis of figuring.\r\nIf skim milk is worth $.30 a hundred, corn is worth $2.32 a hundred.\r\nThis is the same line of reasoning as is used when in an experiment\r\nreported on page 598, if corn is worth $.01 a pound we find that skim\r\nmilk is worth $.30 a hundred. All they prove is that a hog must have\r\nsomething besides corn or milk. Corn is the cheapest hog feed but it is\r\ntoo unbalanced a diet to get the best results when fed alone. A small\r\namount of skim milk or something else will balance the diet. According\r\nto reports published by Henry & Morrison on page 598 it will be noticed\r\nthat 585 pounds of skim milk reduced the amount of grain required to\r\nproduce 100 lb. growth by 179 pounds. If corn is worth $.01 a pound and\r\nwe figure on that basis, skim milk is worth $.31 a hundred pounds. But\r\nnotice what happens when the amount of skim milk is increased beyond\r\nwhat is needed to supply the elements which corn lacks. When the amount\r\nof skim milk is increased by 463 pounds more, the amount of corn meal\r\neaten was only reduced by 56 pounds, so that for the first 585 pounds\r\nthe farmer was getting $.31 but for the next 463 pounds he was getting\r\nonly $.12 a hundred pounds, and when the skim milk was again increased\r\nby 849 pounds the amount of corn meal required was only reduced 71\r\npounds and this figures down the last batch of skim to only about $.08\r\nper hundred pounds. These experiments prove that we must keep somewhere\r\nnear a balanced ration but do not prove anything regarding a definite\r\nvalue of skim as a feed.\r\n\r\nWhat your skim milk is worth on the farm depends altogether on how\r\nmuch it is needed to balance the diet in hog feeding operations. It is\r\nof much more value for little pigs than for larger hogs that are more\r\ncapable of digesting grasses. Professor Henry says, “Pigs fed skim\r\nmilk and grain gained nothing from pasture. Grazing stimulates the\r\nappetites of pigs getting grain but no milk and they eat more grain\r\nand make larger and more economical gains.” So we see that pigs will\r\npass up pasture for milk and that when milk is fed to pigs on pasture\r\nit replaces the use of pasture so that it does not do much good to\r\npasture hogs that are fed milk. Experiments reported on page 614 show\r\nthat pigs on alfalfa pasture require 344 pounds of grain to gain one\r\nhundred pounds and that on rape pasture only 340 pounds are required.\r\n\r\nDifferent experiments always vary slightly as to the amount of grain\r\nrequired to make a certain growth. But taking the most advantageous\r\nration that we can prepare with milk and corn as shown by these\r\nexperiments, we may conclude that something like 300 pounds of grain\r\nand 500 pounds of milk will make one hundred pounds of growth on one\r\nhundred pound hogs, and that about 350 pounds of grain fed to hogs on\r\npasture will make the same amount of growth. Let each farmer figure out\r\nwhat pasture and grain cost him and he can get approximately the real\r\nvalue of skim milk. For large hogs milk will be worth less than here\r\nshown. For smaller hogs it will be worth more.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to know the cost per pound of skim milk solids\r\nfigured at different prices, but the chemical analysis we are not\r\nconsidering. One hundred pounds of milk usually contains about 9.25\r\npounds of solids. If 100 pounds of skim milk is worth $.20, one pound\r\nof dry matter would be worth $.0216 and a ton would be worth $43.20. At\r\n$.40 a hundred, one pound of dry matter would be worth $.0432 and a ton\r\nwould be worth $86.40. At $.50 a hundred, one pound of dry matter would\r\ncost $.0540 and one ton cost $108.00.\r\n\r\n=Whey.= The average composition of whey is about as follows: water\r\n93.12%, and total solids 6.88%. Of the total solids there are about\r\n.27% fat, .81% nitrogenous substances and 5.80% sugar, ash, etc. For\r\npigs whey has a feeding value about half that of skim milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                              MARKET MILK\r\n\r\n\r\n=Weight of Milk.= The weight of milk varies slightly with the\r\ntemperature and also because of the difference in the amount of solids\r\nit contains. An average gallon of milk at 60 degrees weighs 8.6 pounds.\r\nA ten-gallon can filled to the lid should weigh 86 pounds.\r\n\r\nA can large enough to hold 100 pounds of water would hold 103.2 pounds\r\nof average milk at 60 degrees, 103.6 pounds of skim milk, or 90 pounds\r\nof pure butterfat. Cream weighs less than water. The butterfat in milk\r\nis in the form of little particles or globules, which float around in\r\nthe milk. In Holstein milk they are small, in Jersey milk they are\r\nlarger. Cream is simply milk containing a large number of particles of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n=Legal Requirements.= The law requires market milk to test not less\r\nthan 3% butterfat. Milk containing 3% butterfat but less than 11¹⁄₂%\r\ntotal solids is usually considered watered milk. We determine fat\r\ncontent by Babcock test and the solids-not-fat by an instrument called\r\nthe lactometer, which is simply an accurate means of determining the\r\nweight of milk.\r\n\r\nMilk from cows known to be diseased, or from cows fifteen days before\r\ncoming fresh can not legally be sold. After freshening, milk can be\r\nsold as soon as it attains a normal condition. It is illegal to sell\r\nmilk to which water or any other substance has been added, or milk\r\nwhich has been exposed to disease-producing bacteria, or milk that has\r\nbeen stored, handled or transported in an unclean or unsanitary manner.\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness.= The greatest handicap in the milk business is the\r\ndifficulty of getting milk that is as clean as other food which people\r\neat. It is not impossible to do, but it is rarely done. In most all\r\ncities of the United States milk that meets the highest requirements\r\nas to cleanliness and sanitation is being sold for from 20 to 35 cents\r\na quart. Such milk is guaranteed to be pure by a medical board and is\r\nlabeled certified milk. There are various requirements in producing\r\ncertified milk that need not all be explained here. But to the average\r\nconsumer the main difference is that the producer of certified milk is\r\nas careful concerning cleanliness in milking and caring for the milk\r\nas a clean, respectable housekeeper is in making bread. In regular\r\nmarket milk we do not require cleanliness up to the standard for\r\ncertified milk, but all producers and dealers in milk should recognize\r\nand admit the truth that common milk is not nearly as clean as it\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nThe public is well aware of this fact, and the demand for dairy\r\nproducts would be immeasurably increased if thousands of people did not\r\nfeel an aversion to drinking milk because as they say, “It’s so dirty.”\r\nWe can not go to the public and ask all we would like to have unless\r\nwe, in turn, give them just what they want. The public wants clean milk\r\nand I believe that if milk improves in quality the public will use more\r\nof it. No person with dirty hands should ever milk a cow and use the\r\nmilk for human food. A cow’s udder should be washed. The hair on the\r\nudder and flanks should be clipped short, and to prevent dust and hair\r\nfrom getting into the milk, her flanks and udder should be slightly\r\ndampened before milking. A gunnysack cut up in pieces about 14 inches\r\nsquare makes a very good towel on which to dry the udder and the\r\nmilker’s hands. A clean towel should be used for each milking.\r\n\r\nThe cleanliness of milk is usually judged by filtering a small amount\r\nthrough a disc of cotton. This is called the sediment test. This\r\ntest, in a measure determines the amount of filth and foreign matter\r\nwhich milk contains. Sufficient straining will make most any milk so\r\nthat it will show a clean record on the sediment test. But remember\r\nthat a strainer acts as a sort of pulverizer. Milk running through a\r\nstrainer gradually dissolves and washes away the particles until they\r\nare so thoroughly in solution that we can not get them in a clarifying\r\nmachine. We would prefer milk strained through a metal strainer\r\nonly, but in many localities health departments require that it be\r\nfiltered through cloth or cotton. Where this is required we oppose no\r\nobjections. The greatest difficulty with cloth strainers is that they\r\ndo not get washed clean enough. A farmer usually rinses out his cloth\r\nin cold water and hangs it up to dry. Sour strainers are about the\r\nfirst thing we look for on a farm where the people have been having\r\ntrouble keeping milk sweet.\r\n\r\nAbsorbent cotton is all right, providing no cloth is used with it,\r\nbut that it be held between metal straining discs, or that the cloth\r\nbe thrown away each time with the cotton. Since to throw away cotton\r\nstrainers each time is expensive, I do not think the system is\r\npractical for general use. It is easier and far better to keep dirt\r\nfrom getting into the milk than to let everything go in and then try to\r\nget it all out again.\r\n\r\n=Sanitation.= Sanitation means “pertaining to health.” Clean milk might\r\nbe unsanitary for it might contain injurious bacteria. Bacteria are\r\nplants. To avoid infecting milk with bacteria which cause souring and\r\ndecay we can not depend upon cleanliness alone. The first few streams\r\nof milk from each teat of the cow will be found already infected to a\r\nconsiderable extent. In certified dairies the first streams of milk\r\nare never used. When cows are not milked dry at each milking there is\r\na considerable development of bacteria that takes place in the teats\r\nand udder. Careless milkers have their trouble starting before the\r\nmilk leaves the udder. Various diseases infect the milk of the cow.\r\nMilk from cows with garget or diseased udders causes sore throats in\r\nchildren and should never be used as food. Dirt that gets into milk is\r\nof itself objectionable, but it is also one of the greatest sources of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nMilk utensils should be sterilized. This may be done by the use of\r\na chlorine solution called Bacilli-Kill, by boiling water, or by\r\nthe direct rays of the sun. Most sterilization is not perfect and\r\neven the dust particles in the air contain enough bacteria to, in a\r\nmeasure, re-seed any surface. Bacteria can not grow without moisture.\r\nIf utensils are not washed perfectly and food particles are left for\r\nbacteria to grow on, there will immediately start a new development\r\nfrom the re-seeding that will take place after the sterilization. Tin\r\ncans can not be washed well enough to make them perfectly free from\r\nfoodstuffs on which bacteria may live. When milk dealers put cream in\r\ncold storage, expecting to hold it sweet for as long as two months\r\nthey use cans that have never been used before. A metal surface is\r\nrough and I know of no way to wash a milk can as perfectly as a milk\r\nbottle. The milk utensils should be thoroughly cleaned with washing\r\npowder, rinsed thoroughly with boiling water, then carefully dried.\r\nIn the operation of cleaning cans the most difficult thing to do in a\r\nfactory is to get the can properly dried. When it cools down there is\r\nlikely to be a certain amount of moisture deposited on the inside of\r\nthe can and there is always enough food left on which bacteria may grow\r\nif the can is moist. In milk plants we sterilize all equipment just\r\nbefore using. Cans washed and sterilized at the plant and used on the\r\nfarm twenty-four or thirty-six hours later become rancid because of\r\nbeing shut with moist air in them. It is our ambition to sometime be\r\nable to send cans to the farmers that will remain perfectly sweet, dry\r\nand sterile, even if they are kept closed for a week. But now we must\r\nconfess to imperfection, and cans that get stale before being used are\r\nperhaps the greatest menace to our milk supply. If a farmer can set\r\nthese cans in the sun with the lid off, it will help greatly. If he can\r\nscald them with boiling water just before he uses them, it will help\r\neven more.\r\n\r\nSome farmers have great difficulty in delivering milk once a day and\r\nhaving it sweet when it arrives at the plant. We have kept a bottle of\r\ncertified milk for more than three weeks in a refrigerator where the\r\ntemperature is above forty degrees and at the end of that time it had\r\nnot turned sour. Such results can be only obtained by experts, but it\r\nis not difficult to become expert enough to always be able to sell milk\r\nthat is in a good marketable condition, delivered once a day.\r\n\r\n=Cooling Milk.= The growth of bacteria in milk depends a great deal\r\nupon its cooling. Milk has a great tendency to take up bad odors, and\r\nits tendency to do this depends upon its temperature. Milk should be\r\ncooled within thirty minutes after it is drawn from the cow. If cooled\r\nbelow seventy degrees immediately and kept at that temperature or\r\nbelow, there will be very little difficulty of milk souring, provided\r\ndue care has been taken regarding sanitation and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nWell water temperature in this climate is usually fifty-four degrees.\r\nBy pumping fresh water through a tank, having it overflow so that\r\nthe warm water will flow off, it is easy in a short time to get milk\r\nas low as sixty-five degrees. When running water is not available,\r\nit is better to stir the milk until it is as cold as it will get in\r\nsuch water as you have, then set the cans in a small tank of fresh\r\nwater that can be pumped by hand if necessary. Many farmers use the\r\nstock tank to cool the milk in first, then use some half barrels cut\r\noff at a height so that the water can not overflow into the milk but\r\nthat it will stand slightly higher than the milk in the cans. Use one\r\nhalf-barrel for each can of night’s milk. In the morning cool the milk\r\nin the tank only. However, the most satisfactory arrangement would be\r\nto have a small engine with which fresh water may be pumped at milking\r\ntime, and let the milk tank overflow into the stock tank until the milk\r\nis cooled and the tank is full of cold water. A tank should be divided\r\nby partitions made of slats running up and down so that a can partly\r\nfilled may float without tipping over. It is not absolutely necessary\r\nthat milk be uncovered while it is being cooled, but the cover prevents\r\nthe milk from cooling as rapidly. Remember that warm water always\r\nrises. The cold water will be at the bottom of the tank. Some farmers\r\ndivide their milk so that the cans will all float. The milk warms the\r\nwater and the warm water rises above the level of the milk in the cans.\r\nMilk should always be covered when left sitting by the road waiting for\r\nthe hauler, and should always be covered in the wagon or truck. Wet the\r\nblanket or canvas that covers the milk. This helps to keep it cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n            EXPERIMENTS BEING TRIED OUT ON OUR DAIRY FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our farm we are equipping to produce certified milk. This will be\r\na new business for us. When we have had more experience along this\r\nline we may write up the results for publication. However, none of our\r\nexperiments are far enough along now for us to be justified in giving\r\nthe results as final.\r\n\r\nThose things which would probably be of greatest interest to farmers\r\nare our small grain elevator, the layout of machinery to shell corn,\r\ngrind feed, cut and re-cut alfalfa and our facilities for handling\r\nmanure. We use electric power which, so far as we know, is the most\r\nsatisfactory power where it is available. The motor requires no firing\r\nup as does a steam engine, and no tinkering such as goes with the use\r\nof gasoline. The motors generally run when you want them to and as long\r\nas you want them to and give very little trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing arrangement of machinery. The conveyor to the\r\nsilage blower is just below the floor. Silage or cut hay drops from the\r\nensilage cutter to this conveyor. Opposite the ensilage cutter is the\r\nfeed grinder into which runs the grain spout from the corn sheller. The\r\nground feed also flows to the conveyor and by shifting the spout of the\r\ncorn sheller the shelled corn will go to the conveyor without being\r\nground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rear view of the barn showing the arrangement of silos.\r\nThe blower pipe for the ensilage cutter will extend through the barn\r\nand with a long arch swing around from one silo to another.]\r\n\r\nOur ensilage cutter is permanently installed at one side of a driveway\r\nin the barn. It will fill three silos without re-setting. By the use of\r\na re-cutting attachment with the ensilage cutter we make finely-chopped\r\nalfalfa of all the stems that the cows will not eat. Cattle will eat\r\nthese stems after they are cut up fine and they make excellent feed\r\nfor our delivery horses. The blower (made by the American Harvester\r\nCompany of Minneapolis) which we use for elevating is separate from the\r\ncutter. It is also used to elevate shelled corn, oats and ground feeds\r\nto bins overhead. The conveyor to this blower is slightly below the\r\nfloor level so that ground feed will run from the feed grinder to the\r\nconveyor, so also will our shelled corn, or oats that we are unloading\r\nfrom wagons, and the re-cut alfalfa. Everything goes to the blower and\r\nis distributed to different bins by turning the spout. An ordinary\r\nensilage cutter can be used as an elevator for grain just as well as\r\nthe separate blower that we use.\r\n\r\nOur system of hauling manure is probably more original than our\r\narrangement for handling feed. We do not shovel the manure out of\r\nthis barn, neither do we push it out. We wash it out with a two-inch\r\nstream of water. The gutters slope from the ends of the barn toward\r\nthe center, being two feet deep at the center of the barn and one\r\nfoot deep at the ends. Over these gutters we have cast-iron grates to\r\nprevent a cow from slipping down. A ten-inch tile leads from the gutter\r\nto a large cess-pool outside of the barn and from this cess-pool we\r\npump the sewerage along a ridge to the highest ground of the farm and\r\nirrigate it down over the fields. We have an abundant water supply\r\navailable, cheap power, and hope this plan will prove a practical means\r\nof handling manure. So far it has been a very easy matter to flush the\r\nmanure from the gutters and our sewerage pump throws 200 gallons per\r\nminute through a four-inch pipe up the hill as far as we want to go. We\r\nuse cut straw for bedding and run plenty of water in with the manure\r\nso the pump will not clog. The picture of the pump shown is taken from\r\nthe catalogue of the American Well Works and does not represent our\r\ncess-pool but is similar to the outfit we use.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Showing the gutter behind the cows with some of the\r\n grates removed. The gutter is being filled with water. When full the\r\n cover to the opening to a 10-inch tile is removed and the rush of the\r\n                      water carries all with it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric-driven sump pump with 3-inch intake and 2-inch\r\n discharge which pumps manure and water at the rate of 200 gallons per\r\n                               minute.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of the barn showing large ventilating flues. At\r\n              the side of the room are the air-intakes.]\r\n\r\nOur water pump requires a ten horse-power motor and will throw 150\r\ngallons per minute. Besides a means of getting manure hauled out, we\r\nexpect to do some irrigating in dry weather. While running both the\r\npump at the well and the sewerage pump we require about ten kilowatts\r\nof current per hour. This costs us about five cents per kilowatt.\r\n\r\nWe have installed the King ventilating system. Where a large herd of\r\ncows are kept in a barn such a ventilating system is a great help. Our\r\nbarn is warm and comfortable but not steamy and close.\r\n\r\nThese systems cost a good deal of money and may not all prove\r\npractical. We are not urging that our example be followed but will be\r\nglad to give any of our readers such data as we may have concerning\r\nthe success of these operations. At our barn we prepare the feed for\r\nall of our delivery horses and we expect to keep sixty cows. The method\r\nof handling manure will eliminate most of the breeding places of flies.\r\nSince this milk will be used raw and is produced for babies especially,\r\nextra precautions are necessary in our case. These things we have taken\r\ninto consideration when planning so expensive a layout. In a few\r\nmonths we will know more about these systems and in a few years we will\r\nhave a conclusive test made. Those who wish to drop in occasionally to\r\nsee how we are getting along will be welcome.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Interior view of milk house showing sterilizing oven,\r\n            cooler, bottle filler and conveyor for cases.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                       DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though I have a farm that at one time I went in debt for and which\r\nI paid for by milking cows, and even though I have spent more of my\r\nworking years on a farm than in an office, I can not always pass as a\r\nfarmer. At one time I attended a farmers’ meeting where the city man\r\nwas up for discussion and a fellow nudged me and said, “Old man, how\r\ndo you like it? Haven’t we got you city guys figured out about right?”\r\nI answered, “City people are just like country people in at least one\r\nrespect. They are just as much inclined to think their own troubles are\r\ngreater than any one else’s.”\r\n\r\nFarmers sometimes speak of themselves as the producers, and so, too,\r\ndo the labor union men. Even the business men at their meetings are\r\ninclined to pat themselves on the back and to take credit for a very\r\nliberal share in production. We all look at things from our own point\r\nof view. We have gone through certain experiences and have not\r\nexperienced others. We can not all expect to be of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nBut we all have the ability to understand each other when we are given\r\nthe chance to see things as other people see them, and it is this\r\nunderstanding which I hope to promote as I write this brief chapter. I\r\nwrite this not as a farmer but as a city man giving opinions gradually\r\nformed in several years as a city milk distributor.\r\n\r\nTo me all are producers alike. The man who sews the shoe for the miner\r\nwho digs the ore that makes the plow that plows the field that raises\r\nthe wheat that makes the bread that the grocer distributes, does what\r\nis just as important but no more so than any other man or woman in the\r\nlong line which production takes. If one may insist that his task forms\r\nthe foundation, another man may claim that his forms the roof. But what\r\nis the difference? Without whom can we well get along?\r\n\r\nWe hear much about the “middle man” who is considered a luxury or\r\nrather an extravagance that ought not to be permitted. Well, I am\r\none of those middle men and the thing does not look that way at all\r\nto me. I think that all we do for the people--all the service we\r\nrender, is worth what we get for it. We middlemen have our troubles\r\nand call ourselves producers and are not in any way conscious of being\r\n“parasites.”\r\n\r\nWhat economic laws apply particularly to one set of people but do not\r\napply to others down the line? What makes one man’s lot harder than\r\nthat of another, and who really has the hardest row to hoe? What shall\r\nwe do to the other fellow to keep him from crime and have justice?\r\nThese are questions answered in as many different ways as there are\r\npeople with different viewpoints. Do we doubt the patriotism of the\r\nclub women in cities who decided to boycott eggs and milk to bring\r\ndown the price just at the time when these commodities were very hard\r\nto produce and the price already too low for the cost? If we do, it\r\nis because we do not understand their viewpoint and their lack of\r\ninformation on which to form different conclusions.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I often used a certain argument which now I do not use\r\nany more because now I am over on the other side, as they say. From the\r\nother side of the fence the proposition does not look at all the same.\r\nThe argument is that the farmer sells his produce in town at the price\r\nthe city man is willing to pay and then must buy at the price that the\r\ncity man will sell for. Since the city man does all the price fixing\r\nthe farmer gets the worst end of the bargain all of the time.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that various markets are juggled by speculators of\r\nvarious kinds and that there are many exploiters in cities who have\r\ntheir knives whetted for any one’s meat they can get. The world has not\r\nyet worked out its complete salvation. We all have a few suggestions\r\nthat we would not mind making to the party in power. But of this I\r\nfeel sure, the majority of business men make their living by rendering\r\nservice the same as do farmers. They are up against propositions that\r\nare a good deal alike. I have not noticed much difference. I have to\r\npay my farmers a good or better bargain than they can get any where\r\nelse. In the same way I must compete for labor. I must render the\r\nbest service the customer can get for the money. After I do all of\r\nthese things, if there is anything left I may have it, and my luck at\r\ndifferent times is good, bad, and all shades between good and bad. All\r\nof us city business men would make more if we could. You can at least\r\ncredit us with being ambitious, but more of us fail than do business\r\nmen in the country.\r\n\r\nAt this time probably half of the factories in the United States are\r\nclosed down, banks are practically all in a critical condition, stores\r\nare advertising merchandise at half price and yet no one seems to buy\r\nand the farmers’ troubles need no description. What shall we do? Well,\r\nI know some things we should not do that I can illustrate with a story.\r\n\r\nA man in Arizona looked down over a ledge of rocks on a cliff and saw\r\nseveral rattle snakes sunning themselves on a ledge thirty feet below.\r\nHaving a small pistol he shot a bullet down among them. Immediately\r\nthere started a battle at the end of which all the rattlesnakes were\r\nbitten. In a few minutes they were all dead. An examination showed that\r\nthe bullet had apparently not hit any snake. The snakes had all lost\r\ntheir lives as a result of a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI heard Major General Wood make a speech in favor of universal\r\nmilitary training but his argument had a different meaning for me\r\nthan he intended it should have. He argued that there will be war\r\nas long as people have honest differences of opinion--therefore\r\nalways be prepared for war. To me it seems that since no amount of\r\npreparation and war equipment can insure peace we must prevent that\r\nhonest difference of opinion. We must keep with all people a better\r\nunderstanding. Wars are misunderstandings and well meaning people\r\nmurder each other because the misunderstandings are kept up with\r\ncensorship and propaganda. People are armed with poisons more deadly\r\nthan the rattlesnake and all will fight at the drop of the hat if they\r\nfeel that they are wronged. What then brings any hope of things better?\r\nIt is the spirit that says “Come let us reason together” that points\r\nthe way to “Peace on earth, good will toward men.”\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that all should remember and that is that we are\r\nall of us the public. There is no corporation “without a heart and\r\nwithout a soul” more heartless than the public. All men strive to do\r\nthe thing the public wants most to have done for only those who please\r\nthe public’s fancy get paid for their efforts. The public pays no\r\none interest on investment. It pays no one for time or effort spent.\r\nIt pays for the service it wants at the time it wants it and all who\r\nmisjudge the public demand may get nothing. Any new process or new\r\ninvention puts many people out of business for the public turns coldly\r\nfrom the old to the new service which it more desires. If we produce\r\ntoo much of anything the price always goes below cost. Where there is\r\nan undersupply of any thing, there is the best market and the more\r\nprofitable business. So it is that by paying or withholding the price\r\nthis great Dame Public keeps all courting her favor and doing the\r\nthings she wants most to have done. She wins with every winner and then\r\ntaxes his income, and lets the loser lose alone.\r\n\r\nBut although we are all up against the same general laws that govern\r\nbusiness there is a difference between farming and most other business.\r\nA contractor will build a building for us if we agree to pay a price\r\nthat he figures will pay his cost plus a profit. Otherwise he will\r\nnot do the work. Contracting is supposed to be a somewhat hazardous\r\nbusiness but it is not so risky as farming for the builder knows before\r\nhe starts what price he is to get. A farmer can not tell until he is\r\nready to market his crop what the market will be. The farmer must pay\r\nthe cost, hoping. Weather has a great deal to do with results in\r\nfarming operations and that makes the business more risky.\r\n\r\nBusiness men in cities as a rule can work much closer to their pay\r\nchecks. This makes it possible for them to come much nearer a system of\r\nalways getting cost plus a profit. Manufacturers usually aim to take\r\norders ahead of their output so that knowing their cost and having\r\ntheir goods already sold at a profit leaves them comparatively clear\r\nsailing. How the farmer can get on the same basis I do not know.\r\n\r\nBut city business is not all a round of pleasure, for city competition\r\nis keen. If one farmer raises forty bushels of corn per acre and\r\nanother can raise sixty, each receives compensation in proportion\r\nto his crop. But if one merchant had that much advantage over his\r\ncompetitor the unfortunate one would be put clear out of business.\r\nCustomers to a merchant are as valuable as pigs are to a farmer and\r\nit is perfectly legal to get the other fellow’s customers in broad\r\ndaylight. So we in competitive business keep busier than some people\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked what I think of farmers’ organizations. Well,\r\nmost business men in other lines of business have associations. They\r\nusually result in some good. It is those who expect too much that are\r\ndisappointed. So simple a thing as an organization can not cure all\r\nof the difficulties in farming. Some farmers in Kentucky organized to\r\nboost the tobacco market by agreeing among themselves to plant fewer\r\nacres. After the agreement many expected a high price for tobacco and\r\nplanted more acres. This is about the kind of co-operation we all have\r\nlearned to expect in associations where money interests are involved.\r\nThese farmers were right, however, in realizing that in order to boost\r\nthe market they had to limit the supply of the product. The law of\r\nsupply and demand always works. It works to the advantage of him who\r\ncan limit the supply or can increase the demand.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you how a trust operates. There is an agreement to fix\r\nprices and production is limited to what will sell at the fixed price.\r\nThen there are fights made against any one outside of the combination\r\nwho undertakes to produce that line of goods. The trust magnate knows\r\nwell that to control a market he must limit the amount of goods for\r\nsale by combining to fight competition. Without that feature trusts\r\nwould be harmless. A trust is a “combination in restraint of trade”--a\r\nfighting organization. Common business men are not afraid to compete\r\nwith trusts. It is always the trust that is afraid. To compete means to\r\nrace. Trusts always want to hamstring the fellows against whom they are\r\nracing.\r\n\r\nTo go back to farmers’ organizations, on account of the nature of\r\ntheir business farmers can never successfully organize to fight down\r\ncompetition of other farmers and prevent them from producing. They can\r\nnot then create an artificial market. Others can sometimes combine\r\nto take advantage of farmers. Farmers can never “get even.” But here\r\nis a truth that many do not realize and it is that although some may\r\nhave a less difficult business than farming, not one person out of a\r\nthousand can avoid competition or has any unfair advantage over other\r\npeople. Those who would differ from this statement could only change\r\nthe figures in the proportion. Change them as you like, and yet we must\r\nagree that it is a good thing that a majority must earn a living in\r\nwhich there is no graft for they will stand for truth and fairness in\r\nthe land. We want freedom in the country and there cannot be freedom\r\nwithout fair competition--equal opportunities for all as nearly as the\r\nlaw can insure them.\r\n\r\nWhere co-operation among farmers can increase efficiency they should\r\nco-operate. The same is true of any other business. For any one to\r\nco-operate in a legitimate way for legitimate purpose is always a\r\nlegitimate thing to do. Co-operation need not interfere with free\r\ncompetition or fair play. I have no word of warning to give to farmers’\r\norganizations that I would not apply as well to others. But I have a\r\nwarning that I would like to sound to all the world. Beware of him\r\nwho accuses all others of guilt. Beware of him who sees only bad in\r\nthe world. There are those “reformers,” they may be called, who would\r\npoison us against our fellows. Watch closely the suggestions of such.\r\nTest their advice by the golden rule. A propaganda of hate is never\r\nneeded in a good cause. Peace on earth can only come by fairness and\r\ngood will. We need each other’s point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nPage 20: “Ofter the fattest,” changed to “Often the fattest,”\r\n\r\nPage 46: “what hapepns” changed to “what happens”\r\n\r\nPage 56:  “the fact increases” changed to “the fat increases”\r\n\r\nPage 93: “an extravangance” changed to “an extravagance”\r\n\r\nPage 99: “corn per ace” changed to “corn per acre”",
