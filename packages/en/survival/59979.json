The dam will be on the Colorado River in\r\nArizona, 13 river miles below the Utah border. Lake Powell will store\r\nabout 28,000,000 acre feet of water--next in size to Lake Mead,\r\ndownstream, America's largest man-made lake--to help solve a water\r\nresource development problem in the Colorado River Basin.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem is the division of the river's water between the\r\nUpper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, as provided by an\r\ninterstate compact. The volume of water flowing down the Colorado\r\nfluctuates sharply from year to year. Consequently, there must be\r\nlong-term holdover storage capacity in order to meet downstream needs\r\nand compact requirements--including requirements for Mexico under an\r\ninternational treaty--and still permit the Upper Basin States to deplete\r\nthe river for upstream use.\r\n\r\nThis problem will be solved by construction of a system of storage dams\r\nand reservoirs in the Upper Basin, of which Glen Canyon, the largest, is\r\none of four initial units authorized. Only 15 miles above the dividing\r\nline between the Upper and Lower Basins, it will store no water for use\r\nupstream or in the immediate vicinity of the dam, but is the principal\r\nunit storing water to regulate the river and thereby fulfill compact\r\ncommitments to the Lower Basin. The sale of hydroelectric energy\r\ngenerated at the multipurpose dams will return practically all of the\r\ncost of the project and a large part of the cost of 11 participating\r\nirrigation projects authorized for initial Upper Basin development.\r\nThat, in general, is how Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado and three other\r\ninitial dams on its tributaries will aid in developing the area. The\r\nparticipating projects just referred to, and scattered throughout the\r\nUpper Basin (11 of them authorized for construction), will irrigate\r\nabout 130,000 acres in new farms and improve irrigation on about 230,000\r\nacres in old ones. Some 25 other projects are under various phases of\r\nstudy. Farming, in consequence, will greatly increase. Water from the 4\r\nbig storage reservoirs will, as planned, turn generators of about\r\n1,200,000-kilowatt capacity, and industry will use the power. Mineral\r\ndeposits of inestimable value, uranium among them, will be mined. Flood\r\ncontrol and navigation on the Colorado will be improved, and the\r\nnation's playgrounds will be greatly enlarged, for some of the world's\r\nfinest recreation places will lie along the shores of the reservoirs or\r\nlakes that will form behind the dams.\r\n\r\nGlen Canyon Storage Unit will be the keystone in this whole structure.\r\nThe dam spans the river near its exit from the Upper Basin, as if in the\r\nspout of a great funnel where it can control all of the water in the\r\nfunnel's cone--the Colorado's own flow and all that its tributaries feed\r\ninto it upstream from the dam. The powerplant will generate about 75\r\npercent of the project's total power and the reservoir will contribute\r\nabout 75 percent of the water storage that the Congress authorized in\r\n1956 as initial development for the Upper Basin. This reservoir or lake,\r\nextending 186 miles behind the dam, will be flanked by remarkably\r\nbeautiful scenery. The Nation's gain in new public and private wealth\r\nwill be tremendous.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government will finance the project, but the people who use\r\nthe water and power will repay about 99 percent of the cost--about\r\ntwo-thirds with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BRIDGE AT THE DAMSITE\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bridge]\r\n\r\nBridges were among the first essentials at Glen Canyon damsite. The\r\nvertical walls of the Canyon rise about 700 feet above the river. The\r\ndistance from rim to rim is only 1,200 feet in a straight line, but it\r\nis about 190 miles by road.\r\n\r\nThe Glen Canyon Bridge, a spectacular rim-to-rim highway, spans the\r\ncanyon immediately downstream from the dam. It is the highest and\r\nsecond-longest steel arch bridge in the United States; its 1,028 foot\r\narch stands 700 feet above the river. The deck is 1,271 feet long. The\r\nroadway is 30 feet wide and is paralleled by 4-foot sidewalks. The\r\nbridge was dedicated and opened to public use on February 20, 1959.\r\n\r\nMaterials and equipment are transported to the canyon floor by\r\nhighlines--heavy cableways stretched between towers, two on each rim.\r\nLoads of 50 tons are lowered from them on pendant hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Construction in progress]\r\n\r\nGlen Canyon Dam, like all large Reclamation dams, is being built by\r\nprivate construction companies that are awarded contracts by competitive\r\nbidding. The prime contract, totaling $107,955,122, was awarded to the\r\nMerritt-Chapman and Scott Corporation of New York City, April 29, 1957.\r\nIt provides for construction of the dam and powerhouse and is the\r\nlargest single contract the Bureau has ever awarded and probably the\r\nlargest for any type of construction project.\r\n\r\nBy June 1960, the contractor had completed the diversion and spillway\r\ntunnels, lined them with concrete, built the coffer dams (temporary\r\nearth structures diverting the river around the damsite during\r\nconstruction), and excavated the foundation of the dam. First placement\r\nof concrete in the foundation of the dam and powerhouse was observed by\r\npublic ceremonies at the damsite on June 17, 1960. Initial storage of\r\nwater behind the dam is scheduled for early 1962.\r\n\r\nA $6,392,000 contract for the manufacture of eight 155,500-horsepower,\r\n150-r.p.m., vertical-shaft hydraulic turbines for the powerplant has\r\nbeen awarded to the Baldwin-Lima Hamilton Corp. Additional contracts for\r\ngenerators and other adjuncts will be awarded later to equip the dam and\r\npowerplant. Glen Canyon's first hydroelectric generating unit is\r\nscheduled to go on line in 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RECREATION PLANS\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Water recreation]\r\n\r\nThe Glen Canyon of the Colorado River is an unusually placid, 162-mile\r\nreach from Hite, Utah, to Lees Ferry, Arizona. Major John Wesley Powell,\r\nwho headed the first expedition down the river in 1869, named it Glen\r\nCanyon because of the occasional oak glens along its banks and at its\r\njunctions with tributaries.\r\n\r\nThe 186-mile-long Glen Canyon Reservoir (Lake Powell) will extend\r\nupstream into Cataract Canyon. The lake and adjoining lands have been\r\nestablished as the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area under the\r\nNational Park Service of the Department of the Interior. This is the\r\nstatus of Lake Mead and its environs behind Hoover Dam.\r\n\r\nThe Park Service will soon undertake construction of recreational\r\nfacilities for public use as Lake Powell begins to fill in 1962. The\r\nGlen Canyon Recreation Area promises to become one of the Nation's\r\noutstanding tourist attractions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Lake Powell, behind Glen Canyon Dam, will be flanked\r\n    by varied and beautiful scenery._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The first placement of concrete--June 17, 1960._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Aerial view of dam and town]\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS TO GLEN CANYON DAM.--Excellent, new, paved highways have been\r\nbuilt to the Glen Canyon damsite. A 76-mile highway through the highly\r\nscenic area has been built from Kanab, Utah, to the damsite. A new\r\n25-mile highway extends northward from Bitter Springs to the damsite.\r\nBoth of these highway links connect with the Glen Canyon Bridge to form\r\na new link in U.S. Highway 89.

When was Glen Canyon investigated as a potential damsite?\r\n    A. First in 1921, then again in 1946 and in subsequent years.\r\n    Q. When was Glen Canyon Dam authorized for construction?\r\n    A. April 11, 1956, as part of the Colorado River Storage Project.\r\n    Q. When did work actually begin?\r\n    A. The first blast was detonated on October 15, 1956.\r\n  COMPLETION SCHEDULES\r\n    Q. When is the dam scheduled to be finished?\r\n    A. Construction of the dam and powerplant is scheduled for\r\n          completion in March 1964.\r\n    Q. When is the first power scheduled to be generated?\r\n    A. The first power should go on the line in the spring of 1964.\r\n                               EXCAVATION\r\n  COFFER DAMS\r\n    Q. What are the coffer dams?\r\n    A. Large, temporary earth dams across the floor of the canyon and\r\n          located upstream and downstream from the foundation and keyway\r\n          areas which mark the axis of the dam.\r\n    Q. Why are coffer dams built?\r\n    A. To divert the Colorado River around the damsite through huge\r\n          diversion tunnels and to keep water out of the work areas\r\n          during construction of the dam and powerplant. The deepest\r\n          excavation to bedrock in the dam foundation is 137 feet below\r\n          the former river level.\r\n  DIVERSION TUNNELS\r\n    Length (West)                                              2,749 feet\r\n    Length (East)                                              3,011 feet\r\n    Diameter (lined) of both tunnels                              41 feet\r\n    Q. Why does the west diversion tunnel carry the most water?\r\n    A. Because the intake of the west tunnel is 34 feet lower than the\r\n          intake of the east tunnel.\r\n  SPILLWAYS\r\n    Q. Where are the spillway intakes located?\r\n    A. They are just upstream from the keyways, one on each rim of the\r\n          canyon.\r\n    Q. Where will the spillways discharge?\r\n    A. Steep, inclined tunnels will extend from the spillway intakes to\r\n          intersect with the diversion tunnels far below. Thus, water\r\n          going through the spillways will emerge from the diversion\r\n          tunnels as the river water now does.\r\n    Q. What is the maximum combined capacity of the two spillways?\r\n    A. 276,000 cubic feet per second.\r\n  POWERPLANT\r\n    Q. Where will the powerplant be located?\r\n    A. On the upstream side of the Glen Canyon Bridge just below the dam.\r\n          The powerhouse will extend across the canyon floor parallel to\r\n          the bridge.\r\n    Q. How large will the powerplant be?\r\n    A. The powerhouse structure will be about 665 feet long and about 160\r\n          feet, or 16 stories high, above the downstream river level.\r\n          Eight generating units will be installed. The rated capacity\r\n          will be 900,000 kw for the powerplant.\r\n    Q. What are the square columns between the dam and the powerplant?\r\n    A. These huge concrete piers will support the 15-foot diameter\r\n          penstock pipes which will carry water from the reservoir\r\n          through the dam and into the turbines in the powerplant.\r\n  GENERAL\r\n    Q. What are the numerous black spots above the tunnel portals and\r\n          elsewhere?\r\n    A. These are 8-inch square metal plates on the ends of anchor bolts.\r\n          The anchor bolts extend into the rock to support the relatively\r\n          thin outer layers of rock.\r\n    Q. What are the white markings on the canyon walls?\r\n    A. Survey control or reference points which have been painted on the\r\n          rock.\r\n    Q. Why was the small suspension footbridge built?\r\n    A. More than 2 years was required to build the Glen Canyon\r\n          Bridge--the highest steel-arch bridge in the world. Therefore,\r\n          the footbridge was built so workers could cross the 1200-foot\r\n          wide canyon; otherwise, it was 200 miles around by road.\r\n                           CONCRETE PLACEMENT\r\n  GENERAL\r\n    Q. How much concrete will the dam contain?\r\n    A. There will be more than 5,000,000 cubic yards of mass concrete in\r\n          the dam, and about 400,000 additional cubic yards in the\r\n          powerhouse, tunnels, and other structures at the damsite.\r\n  AGGREGATE (Sand and gravel for the concrete)\r\n    Q. Where does the aggregate used to make concrete come from?\r\n    A. From the streambed of Wahweap Creek, 6 miles from the damsite.\r\n    Q. Is there a conveyor belt from the aggregate plant to the damsite?\r\n    A. No. The aggregate is hauled in large bottom-dump trucks.\r\n  CEMENT\r\n    Q. How much cement will be needed?\r\n    A. Approximately 3 million barrels, or 12,000,000 sacks.\r\n    Q. Where does the cement come from?\r\n    A. From a new cement plant constructed by the American Cement\r\n          Corporation near Clarkdale, Arizona, 188 miles south of the\r\n          damsite.\r\n  POZZOLAN\r\n    Q. What is pozzolan?\r\n    A. Pozzolan is a cement-like material which occurs in natural\r\n          deposits.\r\n    Q. Why is pozzolan used?\r\n    A. Pozzolan is cheaper than cement; it reduces shrinkage in concrete\r\n          and develops less heat in concrete during the curing period.\r\n    Q. Where is it obtained?\r\n    A. Near Flagstaff, Arizona, about 115 miles from the damsite. About\r\n          220,000 tons will be used along with 564,000 tons (3,000,000\r\n          barrels) of cement.\r\n  CONCRETE MIXING PLANT\r\n    Q. What is capacity of the mixing plant?\r\n    A. The maximum capacity is 480 cubic yards per hour, which is mixed\r\n          in six, 4-cubic yard concrete mixers.\r\n    Q. How large is the mixing plant?\r\n    A. It is 217 feet, or more than 20 stories, in height.\r\n  HIGHLINE CABLEWAYS\r\n    Q. What will the highlines do?\r\n    A. Their main function is to carry the buckets of concrete from the\r\n          batch plant to points of placement in the dam and powerplant.\r\n    Q. What is the size and weight of the concrete buckets?\r\n    A. 12 cubic yards. When filled, the buckets weigh 31 tons, 24 tons of\r\n          which is the concrete carried in the buckets.\r\n    Q. How large are the highlines?\r\n    A. The higher towers are 190 feet tall; the main cable is 4 inches in\r\n          diameter and about 2,000 feet long.\r\n  REFRIGERATION PLANT\r\n    Q. Why is the refrigeration plant necessary?\r\n    A. A large amount of heat is produced by the chemical action of\r\n          cement during the setting of the concrete. The heat must be\r\n          removed to prevent expansion and cracking of the concrete. The\r\n          refrigeration plant supplies the slush ice and cold water\r\n          necessary to reduce this heat.\r\n    Q. How is the heat controlled?\r\n    A. First, the aggregate is sprayed with ice water before going into\r\n          the mixers. Second, slush ice, along with water, is used in\r\n          mixing the concrete. Third, cold water is pumped through pipes\r\n          embedded in the concrete to carry away the heat generated.\r\n    Q. How long will cold water have to be pumped through the cooling\r\n          tubes in the dam?\r\n    A. Approximately 12 days immediately following placement of the\r\n          concrete to prevent uncontrolled cracking. Then for about 52\r\n          days in the second stage, which may be many months later and\r\n          which is for the purpose of assuring uniform shrinking of the\r\n          huge concrete blocks.\r\n  CONCRETE BLOCKS\r\n    Q. How large are the blocks of concrete placed in the dam?\r\n    A. They vary in size. The largest are 70 feet by 180 feet in area;\r\n          all blocks will be 7½ feet thick.\r\n    Q. Why are blocks used rather than building the dam as one solid\r\n          piece?\r\n    A.
