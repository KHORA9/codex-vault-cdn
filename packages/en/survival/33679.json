Wilkin in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe designer of this bulletin first had in mind something of the sort\r\nfor the use of his students, not only the undergraduates, but others\r\nliving on farms, or teaching in Michigan and elsewhere. Whoever grows\r\nseeds to sell, or buys seeds to sow, should be benefited by consulting\r\nthe illustrations which are unsurpassed for accuracy by anything in this\r\ncountry. They were all made by Mr. F. H. Hillman. A hand lens costing\r\nfrom twenty cents to a dollar is almost indispensable in examining our\r\nseeds. The brief descriptions are necessarily made by using definite\r\nscientific terms, which are explained in a glossary at the close of the\r\nwork. A few weeds are not illustrated, for the reason that the plants\r\nhave ceased to produce seeds, such as the horse radish, and some of them\r\nare not conspicuously bad. Not far from half the illustrations are made\r\nfrom small seed-like fruits, likely to be mistaken for seeds, such as\r\nare produced by dandelions, burdocks, narrow-leaved dock, all grasses.\r\nCuts of seeds of several clovers are inserted that students may learn to\r\ndistinguished them from weeds too often mixed with them.\r\n\r\nNo apology is offered for making use of the decimal scale instead of the\r\ncumbersome antiquated English scale, which fortunately is gradually\r\ngrowing out of use. In the back part of the bulletin are duplicate\r\ncopies of the decimal scale that any one can cut out and use for\r\nmeasuring.\r\n\r\nFor copies of the following figures some time ago prepared by Mr.\r\nHillman, we are indebted to the authorities of the Agricultural College,\r\nof Reno, Nevada: 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39,\r\n40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 55, 56, 58, 63, 68, 69, 71, 74, 75, 84, 86, 87, 91,\r\n92, 95, 97, 98, 99, 108, 110, 116, 125, 130, 135, 138, 140, 144, 146,\r\n152, 153, 158, 159, 172, 173, 174, 175, 178, 179, 181, 182, 185, 187,\r\n189, 190, 191, 199, 203, 205, 212, 214, 215.\r\n\r\n    \"A weed is any useless or troublesome plant.\"\r\n    \"A plant out of place or growing where it is not wanted.\"\r\n    \"Tobacco.\"\r\n    \"A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.\"--Emerson.\r\n\r\nWeeds everywhere; they thrive in the cornfield, they choke wheat in the\r\nfield, they annoy the gardner, they thrive in the meadow, they spring up\r\nby the roadside, they encroach on the swamp, they damage the fleeces of\r\nsheep. The rapid increase in the number and variety of weeds should\r\ncause alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF WEEDS.\r\n\r\n1. They rob cultivated plants of nutriment.\r\n\r\n2. They injure crops by crowding and shading.\r\n\r\n3. They retard the work of harvesting grain by increasing the draft and\r\nby extra wear of machinery. (Bindweed, thistles, red root.)\r\n\r\n4. They retard the drying of grain and hay.\r\n\r\n5. They increase the labor of threshing, and make cleaning of seed\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n6. They damage the quality of flour, sometimes making it nearly\r\nworthless. (Allium vineale L.)\r\n\r\n7. Most of them are of little value as food for domestic animals.\r\n\r\n8. Some weeds injure stock by means of barbed awns. (Squirrel tail\r\ngrass, wild oats, porcupine grass.)\r\n\r\n9. Some of them injure wool and disfigure the tails of cattle, the manes\r\nand tails of horses. (Burdock, cocklebur, houndstongue.)\r\n\r\n10. A few make \"Hair balls\" in the stomachs of horses. (Rabbit-foot\r\nclover, crimson clover.)\r\n\r\n11. Some injure the quality of dairy products. (Leeks, wild onions.)\r\n\r\n12. Penny cress, and probably others, when eaten by animals, injure the\r\ntaste of meat.\r\n\r\n13. Poison hemlock, spotted cowbane and Jamestown weed are very\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n14. Many weeds interfere with a rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n15. All weeds damage the appearance of a farm and render it less\r\nvaluable. (Quack-grass, Canada thistle, plantains.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SMALL BENEFITS.\r\n\r\n1. They are of some use in the world to induce more frequent and more\r\nthorough cultivation, which benefits crops.\r\n\r\n2. The new arrival of a weed of first rank stimulates watchfulness.\r\n(Russian thistle.)\r\n\r\n3. In occupying the soil after a crop has been removed they prevent the\r\nloss of fertility by shading the ground.\r\n\r\n4. Weeds plowed under add some humus and fertility to the soil, though\r\nin a very much less degree than clover or cow peas.\r\n\r\n5. Some of them furnish food for birds in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ENABLES A PLANT TO BECOME A WEED.\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes by producing an enormous number of weeds. (A large plant of\r\npurslane, 1,250,000 seeds; a patch of daisy fleabane, 3,000 to a square\r\ninch.)\r\n\r\n2. In other cases by the great vitality of their seeds. Shepherd's\r\npurse, mustard, purslane, pigeon-grass, pigweeds, pepper-grass, May\r\nweed, evening primrose, smart weed, narrow-leaved dock, two chick-weeds\r\nsurvive when buried in the soil thirty years at least, as I have found\r\nby actual test.\r\n\r\n3. In each prickly fruit of a cocklebur there are two seeds, only one of\r\nwhich grows the first year, the other surviving to grow the second year.\r\n\r\n4. Some are very succulent, and ripen seeds even when pulled.\r\n(Purslane.)\r\n\r\n5. Often by ripening and scattering seeds before the cultivated crop is\r\nmature. (Red root, fleabane.)\r\n\r\n6. Sometimes by ripening seeds at the time of harvesting a crop, when\r\nall are harvested together. (Chess, cockle.)\r\n\r\n7. Some seeds are difficult to separate from seeds of the crop\r\ncultivated. (Sorrel, mustard, narrow-leaved plantain in seeds of red\r\nclover and alfalfa.)\r\n\r\n8. Some are very small and escape notice. (Mullein, fleabane.)\r\n\r\n9. Some plants go to seed long before suspected, as no showy flowers\r\nannounce the time of bloom. (Pigweeds.)\r\n\r\n10. In a few cases the plants break loose from the soil when mature and\r\nbecome tumble-weeds. (Some pigweeds, Russian thistle.)\r\n\r\n11. Some seeds and seed-like fruits are furnished each with a balloon,\r\nor a sail, or with grappling hooks. (Dandelion, sticktights, burdock.)\r\n\r\n12. Some remain with the dead plant long into winter, and when torn off\r\nby the wind or by birds, drift for long distances on the snow, often\r\nfrom one farm to another. (Pigweeds.)\r\n\r\n13. Some have creeping root-stocks or tubers. (Quack-grass, nut-grass.)\r\n\r\n14. Some defend themselves with forks and bayonets. (Thistles.)\r\n\r\n15. Most of them are disagreeable in taste or odor, so that domestic\r\nanimals leave them to occupy the ground and multiply. (Jamestown weed,\r\nstink grass, milk weed.)\r\n\r\n16. Plants with stout roots are sometimes passed over by the harrow or\r\ncultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ARE WEEDS INTRODUCED AND HOW ARE THEY SPREAD?\r\n\r\n1. By live stock, carried in the hair or fleece or carried by the feet;\r\nin some instances passing alive with the excrement.\r\n\r\n2. By unground feed-stuff purchased.\r\n\r\n3. By adhering to the insides of sacks where they were placed with\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n4. In barnyard manure drawn from town.\r\n\r\n5. In the packing of trees, crockery, baled hay and straw.\r\n\r\n6. By wagons, sleighs, threshing machines.\r\n\r\n7. Sometimes by plows, cultivators and harrows.\r\n\r\n8. By railway trains passing through or near a farm.\r\n\r\n9. By ballast of boats at wharves.\r\n\r\n10. By wool-waste at factories.\r\n\r\n11. By birds, squirrels, and mice.\r\n\r\n12. By water of brooks, rivers, by washing rains and by irrigating\r\nditches.\r\n\r\n13. By the wind aided by little wings or down, or by drifting on the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n14. By dropping seeds to the ground from extending branches and\r\nrepeating the process.\r\n\r\n15. By creeping root-stocks, as June grass, quack-grass and toad-flax.\r\n\r\n16. By piercing potatoes, carrots, etc., quack-grass, June grass,\r\nBermuda grass are sometimes carried to other fields or farms where the\r\ntubers and roots are planted.\r\n\r\n17. A farmer buys clover seeds or grass seeds that were grown in some\r\nstate that never before grew seeds that went onto his farm and thus he\r\nmay get some new weeds. Seeds of alfalfa or some other crop bring new\r\nkinds of weeds, especially those of dodder. As every kind of weed goes\r\nonto a farm to stay there it follows that as a country becomes older the\r\ngreater the number of kinds of weeds. As a rule each farm is annually\r\ngetting more sorts of weeds, and as each farmer is cultivating weeds,\r\nthey are more freely distributed in every field and along every roadside\r\nand by exchanging they are carried to neighboring and distant farms.\r\n\r\nA great many farmers buy and sow whatever the merchant offers them under\r\nthe name mentioned. For example, the college has a sample of something\r\ncalled clover seed, sold by a dealer in this state. It contains about 40\r\nper cent of narrow-leaved plantain.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE CERTAIN WEEDS ARE TROUBLESOME.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, years and years ago no new farm in the wilderness of\r\nMichigan contained more than twenty to thirty-five kinds of weeds, as\r\nthere were not more than thirty-five sorts in the entire state, while at\r\npresent there are not far from 250 kinds. A large majority of weeds hail\r\nfrom older countries, more especially from Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are a few weeds, like Canada thistle and quack-grass, that may\r\ninfest any crop of farm or garden, but in most cases, whether to call a\r\nweed very bad depends on the nature of the crop grown, the size of the\r\nweed-seeds and their time of ripening.\r\n\r\nSome weeds have a very wide distribution, thriving all around the world\r\nin temperate climates, while others are more limited in range; some\r\nthrive only in dry, thin, sandy soil and others in wet soils. To some\r\nextent the presence of a few weed-seeds is almost as objectionable when\r\nonce on the farm, as though there were more, because these few may\r\nthrive and seed freely.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the lists of weeds for New Jersey is different from the\r\nlist in Michigan, while half the weeds of Nevada or Oregon are not known\r\nin our state.\r\n\r\nChess, cockle, red root and rye are liable to be troublesome in fields\r\nof winter wheat, because the seeds are more or less difficult to\r\nseparate from this grain and for the reason that they require a portion\r\nof two years to come to maturity.\r\n\r\nMeadows and pastures, especially where the land is not fertile, abound\r\nin weeds that require two years or more to produce seeds, such as\r\nnarrow-leaved dock, bitter dock, bull thistle, carrot, teasel, two kinds\r\nof mulleins, night-flowering catchfly, evening primrose, several kinds\r\nof fleabane, ox-eye daisy, orange hawkweed, two or three kinds of\r\nplantain, Canada thistle, hound's tongue, stick seed, sow thistle, horse\r\nnettle, buttercups, toad flax, silvery cinquefoil, and many more, not\r\nexcluding some annuals, like crab-grass, tickle grass, pigeon grasses.\r\nAs crops of corn, potatoes, beans, turnips, beets and squashes are ready\r\nto harvest at the close of one growing season they are molested more or\r\nless by pigeon grasses, several pigweeds, purslane, crab-grass, barnyard\r\ngrass, tickle grass and a number of others.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 some seventy-five lots of timothy seeds were examined and the\r\nfollowing list of twenty-four species of weeds were found. Doubtless\r\nother weeds may still be found in other lots of timothy seed. No sample\r\nwas entirely free from weeds. Pepper grass was most common, next\r\nfollowed tumble weed and then shepherd's purse:\r\n\r\n  Amaranthus graecizans, Tumble weed.\r\n  Amaranthus retroflexus, Rough pigweed.\r\n  Anthemis Cotula, May weed.\r\n  Brassica arvensis, Charlock.\r\n  Brassica nigra, Black mustard.\r\n  Bursa Bursa-pastoris, Shepherd's purse.\r\n  Carduus arvensis, Canada thistle.\r\n  Carex straminea. A kind of sedge.\r\n  Chenopodium album, Pigweed.\r\n  Chenopodium filicifolium, Another kind of pigweed.\r\n  Lactuca Canadensis, Wild Lettuce.\r\n  Lepidium Virginicum, Wild Pepper-grass.\r\n  Onagra biennis, Evening primrose.\r\n  Panicum capillare, Hair grass, tickle grass.\r\n  Plantago lanceolata, Narrow-leaved plantain.\r\n  Plantago Rugelii, Rugel's Plantain, one of the broad-leaved plantains.\r\n  Poa compressa, Flat-stemmed poa, wire grass.\r\n  Potentilla Monspeliensis, Rough cinquefoil.\r\n  Prunella vulgaris, Self-heal.\r\n  Rumex Acetocella, Field or sheep sorrel.\r\n  Sisymbrium officinale, Hedge mustard.\r\n  Verbena angustifolia, Narrow-leaved vervain.\r\n  Verbena hastata, Blue vervain.\r\n  Verbena urticifolia, White vervain.\r\n\r\nIn examining some 130 lots of clover seeds as found in the market during\r\n1897, thirty-two kinds of weed seeds were found. Sheep sorrel was most\r\ncommon, next to this yellow or bitter dock and green foxtail. Only three\r\nsamples of clover seed was free from weeds, but possibly some weeds\r\nmight have been seen if larger quantities had been looked over.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1908, eleven years later, 47 kinds of weed seeds were\r\nfound in 122 lots of seed of red clover, a gain of nearly 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nDuring three months from January 1, 1910, in examining 450 lots of seeds\r\nof grasses, clovers and alfalfas, besides large numbers of common weeds\r\nthat we know, were 74 kinds not known to the writer. Of these 74 kinds,\r\nprobably some will never become weeds of any account. Some of these came\r\nwith alfalfa from Montana and some were importations from Europe and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nParasitic fungi rank as weeds; such as rusts and smuts of wheat, oats,\r\ncorn; apple scab, black knot of plum, brown rot of cherry, anthracnose\r\nof beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MEANS FOR PREVENTING THE INTRODUCTION OF WEEDS AND A FEW RULES FOR\r\nTHEIR EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n1. The right kind of a man, who will carefully observe and study the\r\nkinds of weeds and their habits, fighting each to the best advantage, i.\r\ne. with method.\r\n\r\n2. See that all seeds purchased or grown at home for seed are free from\r\nseeds of weeds. Although often heard, these words are too little\r\nheeded.\r\n\r\n3. See that threshing machines, hay racks, grain bags from other farms\r\nare well cleaned before used on the farm.\r\n\r\n4. Cook or grind screenings and burn chaff when certain weeds are\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n5. Send seeds to the Agricultural College, East Lansing, for\r\nidentification, unless they are known to be harmless.\r\n\r\n6. Strive to prevent weeds from ripening seeds. This is especially\r\nimportant late in the season in case of all pigweeds, purslane and\r\nothers where the flowers are very small and are liable to be overlooked\r\nand the seeds ripen before their presence is suspected.\r\n\r\n7. For meadow or pasture make the soil very fertile, as most weeds will\r\nthen be killed or crowded by the better grass and become of little\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n8. Modify the rotation of crops with reference to killing the weeds.\r\n\r\n9. Make a specialty of hoed or cultivated crops.\r\n\r\n10. Make soiling crops a prominent feature in certain fields.\r\n\r\n11. Smother weeds with quick growing and thickly seeded crops, like red\r\nclover or rye or buckwheat.\r\n\r\n12. Keep some crops growing on the land from early spring till late\r\nautumn,--double cropping, i. e., two cultivated crops in one year for\r\nbarn and cellar instead of one for use and one of weeds.\r\n\r\n13. Cultivate thoroughly after a crop is removed.\r\n\r\n14. Clean up and avoid leaving any vacant or out of the way places for\r\nbreeding ground.\r\n\r\n15. Where practicable, remove fences and cultivate to the gutters of the\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\n16. Keep some sheep.\r\n\r\n17. When once begun, continue the work thoroughly from year to year,\r\ngiving no quarter to weeds. This is the easiest in the long run and the\r\nroyal way.\r\n\r\n18. Where hand labor is employed, it is far less expensive and much\r\neasier to keep weeds down by raking or hoeing once a week than by going\r\nover the ground much less frequently.\r\n\r\nThe habits of a weed determine to a great extent the best mode of\r\nfighting it. Certain remedies suggest themselves for creeping\r\nperennials, like quack grass and toad flax, while different treatment is\r\nbest for narrow-leaved dock; and still a different mode of attack may be\r\nadopted for crab grass and purslane.\r\n\r\nWeeds are annuals, as pigweeds, crab grass, purslane; biennials as bull\r\nthistle and mulleins; perennials, like quack grass, Canada thistle,\r\nox-eye Daisy.\r\n\r\nWill it pay? The annual cost of successfully fighting a weedy farm of\r\n100 acres in Ontario has been found to be about $75. Good cultivation in\r\nthe long run pays a greater profit than slipshod culture. It not only\r\nkills the weeds, but keeps the soil in condition for securing good\r\ncrops. It conserves moisture.\r\n\r\nPerennial plants cannot gain any if the green leaves are not allowed to\r\nappear. The nourishment stored in the root stocks underground will aid\r\nthe plant to send up slender leaves and if these remain, the plants gain\r\nand recruit, but if the leaves start underground and are cut off before\r\ncoming to the light, these root stocks are drawn on again to furnish\r\nfood to start more leaves and thus, in time become exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDS OF MICHIGAN WEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n=Ergot.= _Claviceps purpurea._ This is a poisonous fungus, not a seed,\r\nmentioned here because it is frequently found as an outgrowth of the\r\ngrain of many grasses, such as rye, timothy, red top. To mature spores,\r\nit must pass to another stage requiring six months or more.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASS FAMILY. GRAMINEAE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n=Quack-Grass. Couch-Grass.= _Agropyron repens_ (L.) Beauv. Florets about\r\n1 cm. long, 5-nerved at the short-awned apex: grain seldom produced and\r\nstill less frequently found apart from the floral glume and palea,\r\nlinear, about 4 mm. long, base abruptly acute, apex rounded, rounded on\r\nthe back or outside, inside concave. Our worst weed. Introduced from\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n=Wild Oat.= _Avena fauta_ L. Freed from chaff the floral glume is firm,\r\nrough, brown, thinly hairy, about 15 mm. long, awn from near the middle\r\n2-4 cm. long with several firm twists, abruptly bent near the middle,\r\nthe true grain seldom separated from the firmer floral glume. A bad weed\r\nin Oregon and California, seldom seen in Michigan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n=Field Chess.= _Bromus arvensis_ (L.)

Introduced\r\nfrom Europe and becoming frequent in grass land. Its worst feature is to\r\nsupply seeds that may be mistaken for and mixed with seeds of alfalfa\r\nand red clover. The seeds differ from those of alfalfa in being more\r\ncommonly egg-shaped than kidney-shaped in outline. The scar is nearer\r\nthe small extremity in these seeds than in those of alfalfa. For pasture\r\nthis is less valuable than white clover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.]\r\n\r\n=Alfalfa. Lucerne.= _Medicago sativa_ L. Seeds varying much in shape and\r\nsize owing to their crowding in the pod when young, yellowish green to\r\nlight brown.

Very common.\r\nIntroduced from Europe.\r\n\r\n=Mammoth Clover= is a variety or race or red clover, the seeds of which\r\nare indistinguishable from the seeds of red clover. As a rule they are\r\ndarker in color and rather smaller. Red clover and mammoth clover are\r\nusually much mixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.]\r\n\r\n=Low Hop-clover.= _Trifolium procumbens_ L. A low, yellow-flowered\r\nannual, often becoming a tumble-weed at maturity. Seeds plump, shining,\r\nstraw-colored to light brown, broad oval, very slightly flattened, 1 mm.\r\nlong, three-fourths anatropous, i. e., the scar is a very little\r\ndistance from one end of the seed.

Pods broadly\r\nheart-shaped; seeds pale yellow, a trifle darker than those of V.\r\nofficinalis, light, reddish yellow, in shape and markings much like\r\nthose of V. peregrina, flattened, broadly oval to obovate .5-.7 mm.\r\nlong, with a small scar near the middle on one side, from which extends\r\na dark line (raphe) to one extremity.\r\n\r\nApparently native to this country.\r\n\r\nSeeds of the Veronicas are very difficult to distinguish from one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAIN FAMILY. PLANTAGINACEAE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.]\r\n\r\n=Sand Plantain.= _Plantago arenaria_ W. & K. Seeds dark amber brown,\r\nshining, rounded on the back like the bottom of a shallow canoe, 2.5-3\r\nmm. long, transverse groove around the middle of the back, opposite side\r\nwith a groove extending lengthwise, about as wide as the ridge on either\r\nside of it; hilum in the middle of the groove. Found at Harrisville,\r\nMich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.]\r\n\r\n=Large-bracted Plantain.= _Plantago aristata_ Michx. Seeds oval, dull,\r\nlight to dark brown, 2.2-3 mm. long, shaped like a shallow, thick-walled\r\ncanoe with ends rounded alike, outer face marked by a shallow,\r\ntransverse groove at or near the middle, a white line marking the margin\r\nat the base on the canoe inside, two white-margined pits occupying the\r\nmiddle of the concave side.

Seeds\r\nshining, amber-colored to brown, oval, 2-2.5 mm. long, shaped like a\r\nshallow, thick-walled canoe with ends rounded alike, a dark scar\r\noccupying the middle of the narrow concave side, a faint, transverse\r\ngroove across the convex side near the middle sometimes apparent. Often\r\nfound mixed with clover seeds from which it is very difficult to\r\nseparate. Introduced from Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.]\r\n\r\n=Broad-leaved Plantain.= _Plantago major_ L. Seeds, light to dark brown\r\nor very nearly black, 1-1.5 mm. long, slightly flattened, with acute\r\nedges very variable in shape, oval, oblong, rhomboidal and trapezoid,\r\nthe surface roughened by slender, colored ridges, appearing under the\r\nlens as slightly wavy lines, radiating from the scar. The clear light\r\ngreen color of the lower end of the leaf-stem is an easy mark to\r\ndistinguish this plant from another broad-leaved plantain, _P. Rugelii_\r\nin which the base of leaf is red. Introduced from Europe. About door\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.]\r\n\r\n=Rugel's Broad-leaved Plantain.= _Plantago Rugelii Decne._ Seeds dark\r\nbrown to black, much like those of P. major, but larger, 1.5-2.5 mm.\r\nlong slightly flattened, with edges acute, very variable in shape, oval\r\noblong, rhomboidal, surface minutely roughened and dull, but wholly\r\nwithout ridge or lines as in P. major.

Achenes hard, straw-colored to\r\nlight brown or black, top-shaped, broadly oval, 2.5-3 mm. long, besides\r\nthe beak 1.5 mm. long, the sides irregularly ridged vertically, with\r\n5-10 short teeth at the apex. Sometimes the hard covering is removed by\r\na clover huller, exposing the naked seed. Native of the U. S.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.]\r\n\r\n=Great Ragweed.= _Ambrosia trifida_ L. Achenes hard, brown, more or less\r\nmottled, top-shaped, 7-8 mm. besides the stout beak 2-3 mm. long, sides\r\nwith 5 stout ridges terminating in 5 short teeth. Native to the United\r\nStates.

Old roads and waste places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.]\r\n\r\n=Great Burdock.= _Arctium Lappa._ So far as I have seen the achenes of\r\nthis species, when compared with A. minus, are darker colored, rather\r\nlonger, the ribs more distinct.\r\n\r\n=Smaller Burdock.= _Arctium minus_ Beruh. Possibly only a variety of _A.\r\nLappa_ L., but the prevailing plant in central Michigan. I see no way of\r\ndistinguishing the achenes of one from the other; but it makes little\r\ndifference as one burdock is as bad as another.\r\n\r\nFlowers purple; achenes dull brown, often spotted with black, straight\r\nor curved, slightly flattened, oblong-prismatic with 3-5 narrowly ridged\r\nangles, and occasionally other smaller ridges, 4.5-6 mm. long.\r\nIntroduced from Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.]\r\n\r\n=Biennial Wormwood.= _Artemisia biennis_ Willd.

Outer scales of the head thin, white, stiff; achenes\r\nyellowish white or brown, slightly flattened, smooth, oval or oblong,\r\n.5-.7 mm. long. Native to this country. Not often troublesome.\r\n\r\nMuch practice with a good lens and careful comparisons with other small\r\nachenes will be necessary in identifying such specimens as are furnished\r\nby this species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.]\r\n\r\n=Low Cudweed.= _Gnaphalium uliginosum_ L. Outer scales of the head thin,\r\nbrown, more or less wooly; achenes .4-.6 mm. long, yellowish white to\r\nbrown, slightly flattened, smooth, narrowly oblong .4-.6 mm. long.\r\nAchenes narrower and rather shorter than those of G. obtusifolium.\r\nNative to this country. Not of high rank as a weed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.]\r\n\r\n=Broad-leaved Gum Plant.= _Grindelia squarrosa_ (Pursh.) Dunal.

Native to the upper\r\npeninsula of Michigan where it most likely was at one time introduced\r\nfrom the west. It has not been found in the lower peninsula, probably\r\nbecause it had no means of coming across Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.]\r\n\r\n=Wild Lettuce.= _Lactuca Canadensis_ L. Flowers yellow; achenes black or\r\nnearly so, flattened, oval, bearing 3 ribs, the lateral ones sometimes\r\ndouble, the middle one slender, surface abounding in minute transverse\r\nridges as seen under a lens, the remains of a beak sometimes remaining.\r\nNative of this country.
