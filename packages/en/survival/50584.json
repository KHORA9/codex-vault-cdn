The insects and\r\ndiseases discussed are the more common ones attacking forest and\r\nornamental trees. Prompt identification and treatment of these pests may\r\nmean the difference between losing or saving a valuable shade tree.\r\nUnderlying all successful forest and ornamental pest control efforts,\r\nhowever, is the necessity to keep trees in a healthy, vigorous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to include pictures of the damage as well as pictures\r\nof the damage-causing organism or stage. Chemical suppression\r\nrecommendations are not included in this publication. For pesticide\r\ninformation contact the local State or Federal extension specialist,\r\nforester, entomologist, or pathologist.\r\n\r\nCredit for some of the pictures in this guide goes to the Southern and\r\nSoutheastern Forest Experiment Stations and universities. We acknowledge\r\nthe help of the Forest Pest Management field personnel who assisted in\r\ncompiling this booklet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n

subsignarius_ (Hbn.)\r\n\r\nThe elm spanworm is a native insect which is widely distributed over the\r\neastern half of the United States and Canada from Nova Scotia south to\r\nGeorgia and west to Colorado. The most widespread outbreak on record\r\noccurred during the period 1954-1963 when over one million acres of\r\nhardwood forests were defoliated in the mountains of western North\r\nCarolina, eastern Tennessee and northern Georgia. The elm spanworm feeds\r\nupon hickories and a variety of hardwoods; white oak, chestnut oak, and\r\nnorthern red oak are the species most heavily defoliated in the\r\nAppalachians. Repeated defoliation causes growth loss, reduces mast\r\ncrops, and will eventually kill the tree.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sixth instar elm spanworm larva.]\r\n\r\nEggs are laid in masses of 12 to 200 on the undersides of host tree\r\nbranches in early July. Winter is spent in the egg stage. Larvae hatch\r\nin early spring when foliage opens. The larval stage is an “inchworm” or\r\n“looper”, approximately 1½ inches long when mature. Larval coloring\r\nvaries from green or light brown to black, depending upon population\r\ndensity. The typical color of the larva in heavy populations is dark\r\nbrown to black, with a dark-red head, legs, and anal shield. The larvae\r\nfeed for about 1½ months, and then pupate in a loose cocoon for six to\r\nten days. The adult, a snow-white moth, emerges in late June or early\r\nJuly. There is one generation per year.\r\n\r\nNatural enemies help keep populations of the elm spanworm in check. One\r\nof the most important is _Telenomus alsophilae_, a tiny wasp which\r\nparasitizes eggs. Persistent outbreaks on high-value stands may require\r\ntreatment with chemicals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Elm span worms feeding on oak.]\r\n\r\n\r\n            FALL CANKERWORM, _Alsophila pometaria_ (Harris)\r\n\r\nThe fall cankerworm is widespread in the northern part of the United\r\nStates, ranging south through the Appalachian Mountains to North\r\nCarolina. Larvae defoliate many species of hardwoods, but in the South\r\nseem to prefer oaks, hickories, and ash.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Mature fall cankerworm larva.]\r\n\r\nThe winged male and wingless female adults emerge on mild days in\r\nNovember and December and mate. Females lay 6-300 eggs in neatly\r\narranged masses encircling small branches and twigs. The pale green\r\nlarvae hatch in late April or early May. As they mature they may remain\r\nlight green, or change to a very dark brownish-green depending on the\r\nhost. Newly hatched inch-worms (larvae) of the fall cankerworm chew\r\nsmall holes in expanding leaves of their hosts, or may completely\r\nskeletonize the leaves. Mature larvae consume all but the mid-rib and\r\nmajor veins of the leaf. Feeding is usually completed in four to five\r\nweeks, at which time larvae drop to the ground to pupate in the soil.\r\n\r\nCold, wet weather during the early larval period, and parasitization,\r\nare responsible for sudden declines in established populations. Chemical\r\ncontrol has also been effective. A small wasp, _Telenomus alsophilae_\r\nViereck, has caused a sharp decline in outbreaks of cankerworm\r\npopulations. Usually, however, outbreak conditions must exist for\r\nseveral years before the parasite can attain the density needed to cause\r\na decline.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Female cankerworm adult depositing eggs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  A LOOPER, _Phigalia titea_ (Cramer)\r\n\r\nLarvae of this moth, one of the measuring worms, have periodically been\r\nresponsible for scattered mortality of hardwoods throughout the eastern\r\nUnited States. Mortality is most likely to occur in stands on\r\nlow-quality sites, particularly during periods of drought which favor\r\nthis insect’s development and further weaken infested trees. This\r\nspecies is likely to be found in almost any hardwood area in the eastern\r\nUnited States. The insect feeds on a wide variety of trees and shrubs.\r\nHost trees in the Southeast include oaks, hickories, black tupelo, and\r\nblack locust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Phigalia adult male moth.]\r\n\r\n_Phigalia titea_ overwinters as a pupa. Adults emerge in late March to\r\nmid-April, and mate. The female lays her eggs in protected sites on\r\nbranches and trunks of hardwoods. Eggs are most often laid in crevices\r\nand beneath the bark of dead branches. Eggs hatch in April, and larvae\r\nfeed until early June. Larvae often feed on unopened buds, causing\r\nirregular holes in the developing leaves. Larvae first eat just the\r\nsurfaces of leaves, but later consume all leaf tissue between the major\r\nveins. When larvae are dislodged by wind or feeding predators they fall\r\nor descend on a silken thread and continue feeding in the lower crown or\r\non understory vegetation. Pupation occurs on the soil surface or in the\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Phigalia larva.]\r\n\r\nWeather regulates populations of this insect. Soil-inhabiting insects\r\nand rodents are believed to destroy many pupae during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n         EASTERN TENT CATERPILLAR, _Malacosoma americanum_ (F.)\r\n\r\nThe presence of the eastern tent caterpillar is objectionable more from\r\nan aesthetic standpoint than from its effect on the host tree. The ugly\r\ntents constructed by the feeding larvae make this pest highly\r\nobjectionable on shade trees. Black cherry and other species of the\r\ngenus _Prunus_ are preferred hosts, but other trees in the family\r\n_Rosaceae_ are sometimes attacked. This insect is widely distributed\r\nwherever host trees are found east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Larvae and tent of eastern tent caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars appear at about the same time the leaves of black\r\ncherry begin to unfold. The larvae construct a web or tent in the crotch\r\nof a small branch, and begin feeding. Usually they consume entire\r\nleaves, except for the large veins. As the larvae mature, they add to\r\nthe tent, which may reach a foot in diameter and two feet in length.\r\nReaching maturity in about six weeks, the larvae drop to the ground and\r\npupate. The moths emerge in June and the females lay eggs. Eggs of the\r\neastern tent caterpillar are shiny black masses which encircle the\r\nsmaller twigs and are quite noticeable. The insect overwinters in the\r\negg stage.\r\n\r\nControl on ornamental, fruit, and shade trees is achieved by pruning off\r\nand burning the tents containing the caterpillars.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tent caterpillar-infested black cherry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         FOREST TENT CATERPILLAR, _Malacosoma disstria_ (Hbn.)\r\n\r\nThe forest tent caterpillar has caused repeated serious defoliation of\r\nhardwood forests throughout North America. Aspen, water tupelo, hard\r\nmaple, gums, and oaks are preferred hosts but this insect will feed on a\r\nvariety of other broadleaf trees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Forest tent caterpillar larvae.]\r\n\r\nThe shiny black egg masses encircling the twigs of host trees can be\r\nseen during winter months. Small black, hairy larvae hatch out just as\r\nthe leaves are beginning to unfold. They do not construct a tent, but\r\nmake a silken mat on the larger branches or trunk of the tree on which\r\nthey rest between feeding periods. When full grown, the larvae are about\r\ntwo inches long, brownish-black with distinctive white, keyhole-shaped\r\nspots down the middle of the back, and blue lines along the sides. Just\r\nbefore pupating, the larvae spin a whitish silk cocoon on the bark or\r\nleaf of the host. In about ten days the light brown moths emerge, mate,\r\nand the females begin laying their eggs.\r\n\r\nParasitic flies are one of the more important agents which normally keep\r\nthis insect under control. Outbreaks occur with some regularity,\r\nhowever, and chemicals may be required to prevent defoliation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Colony of third instar larvae.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                FALL WEBWORM, _Hyphantria cunea_ (Drury)\r\n\r\nThe fall webworm is not considered an important forest pest. However,\r\nugly webs can seriously detract from aesthetic values. The preferred\r\nhosts in the South are persimmon, pecan, and sourwood, but it is also\r\nfound on black walnut, hickory, cherry, sycamore, crab apple, and\r\nsweetgum. The insects range throughout North America.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fall webworm larva.]\r\n\r\nThe adult is a pure white moth about 1¼ inches long. The forewing is\r\nsometimes marked with blackish dots. The larva is about one inch long\r\nwhen full grown, generally pale yellow or greenish with a broad dark\r\nlongitudinal stripe on the back and a yellowish stripe extending from\r\nblack and orange warts. The insect has one generation per year in the\r\nnorthern part of its range, and two in the southern part. Moths of the\r\nfirst generation emerge from May to July and those of the second in July\r\nand August. Adult females lay 400-500 eggs in white cottony patches on\r\nthe underside of the leaves of host plants. The eggs hatch in about a\r\nweek, and the larvae form a web and begin to skeletonize the leaves by\r\nfeeding in rows. As the larvae grow they expand the web to cover the\r\ncolony. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they crawl or drop to the\r\nground and form a brownish cocoon in the duff around the tree where they\r\noverwinter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fall webworm infestation.]\r\n\r\nNatural enemies usually keep this insect under control. Webs can be\r\npruned from high-value trees in scenic or recreation areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n              OAK LEAF TIER, _Croesia albicomana_ (Clem.)\r\n\r\nThis oak leaf tier has been associated with the decline and mortality of\r\nseveral species of oak in the northeastern United States and southern\r\nAppalachians. An outbreak population in the mountains of West Virginia\r\nand Virginia in 1966-68 resulted in the loss of several thousand acres\r\nof scarlet oak. Usually such outbreaks coincide with periods of drought\r\nwhich increase the impact of defoliation on the host. Its hosts include\r\nnorthern red oak, black oak, scarlet oak, and pin oak. The latter two\r\nspecies seem to be hit hardest by this insect.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Leaf tier adult and pupa.]\r\n\r\n_Croesia albicomana_ spends the winter in the egg stage. Eggs are glued\r\nto small twigs in the crown of the host tree. Hatch occurs from\r\nmid-April to early May. Young larvae, which emerge before bud-break,\r\nbore into and mine the expanding buds. When large numbers of this insect\r\nare present they can destroy most of the vegetative buds on a tree.\r\nLater the older larvae tie down a folded-over portion of a leaf and feed\r\non it. Leaves fed on by the oak leaf tier appear to be full of shot\r\nholes. As the larvae near maturity they may tie the apical portion of\r\ntwo or more leaves together and feed on them. Mature larvae then drop to\r\nthe ground to pupate in the litter. Adult moths emerge in June or early\r\nJuly, mate, and the female immediately begins laying eggs. The small,\r\nflat, oval eggs are deposited individually on small twigs, generally\r\naround nodes or leaf scars.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Scarlet oak killed by leaf tier.]\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the natural factors which regulate population levels\r\nof this insect, but undoubtedly weather is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n      VARIABLE OAK LEAF CATERPILLAR, _Heterocampa maneto_ (Dbldy.)\r\n\r\nThe variable oak leaf caterpillar periodically defoliates extensive\r\nareas of hardwood forest in the eastern United States. Its range covers\r\nall of the southern and eastern states as far west as east Texas. The\r\nlarvae feed primarily on oaks but will also feed on beech, basswood,\r\nbirch and elm. Other defoliating insects may be associated with\r\noutbreaks causing additional damage. Young larvae skeletonize the leaf\r\nwhile older larvae devour the entire leaf except the primary veins.\r\nInfestations are generally more severe in the South, where the insect\r\nhas two generations per year causing two periods of defoliation in a\r\nsingle year. While infestations usually subside before many trees are\r\nkilled, heavy defoliation reduces the tree’s growth and vigor.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Larva of the variable oak leaf caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nThe variable oak leaf caterpillar overwinters as a non-feeding larva in\r\na cocoon on the forest floor. It pupates and emerges as a moth the\r\nfollowing spring. The female moth, gray in color and about 1¾ inches\r\nlong, lays about 500 eggs singly on the leaves of host trees. The larvae\r\nfeed on foliage for five or six weeks, drop to the ground to pupate, and\r\nemerge as adults in mid-summer. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by the\r\nsecond generation of moths defoliate the trees for a second time during\r\nlate summer. By late October the mature larvae of the second generation\r\nhave dropped to the forest floor to overwinter. The full grown larva is\r\napproximately 1½ inches long. Color varies among individuals. The head\r\nis generally amber brown with curved diagonal white and black bands. The\r\nbody is usually yellow green with a narrow white stripe down the center\r\nof the back bordered by wider dark bands.\r\n\r\nOutbreaks of the variable oak leaf caterpillar may be severe but\r\ngenerally subside before serious tree mortality occurs. Parasites and\r\npredators are not effective in controlling rising populations of the\r\ninsect. Mice and predaceous beetles feed on the resting larvae and pupae\r\nin the litter and soil of the forest floor. While no chemical is\r\ncurrently registered for control of this insect, chemical spraying has\r\nbeen effective and safe in controlling closely related insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n          LOCUST LEAFMINER, _Xenochalepus dorsalis_ (Thunberg)\r\n\r\nThe locust leafminer is a destructive pest of black locust and honey\r\nlocust in both the adult and larval stages. It is found throughout the\r\nrange of these trees in the eastern half of North America. The adults\r\nalso feed on other species of trees.\r\n\r\nThe adult beetles overwinter in crevices in the bark of trees and under\r\nlitter on the forest floor. The beetles emerge and begin feeding in the\r\nspring, usually after mid-April. After feeding for a short time they\r\ndeposit eggs on the undersides of leaves, piling them one upon another,\r\nsomewhat shingle-like. Eggs are covered with brownish fecal matter.\r\nLarvae soon hatch and eat into the leaf tissue to form a mine. Newly\r\nemerged larvae feed gregariously in a single mine for a short time. They\r\nthen construct new mines where the insects live singly. Several mines\r\nare constructed before the larvae reach maturity. The larvae pupate in\r\nthe mines and emerge as adults in July to begin the second generation.\r\nThe adult beetles are foliage feeders, eating irregular holes in leaves.\r\nWhen sufficient in number they may defoliate host trees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Damage to black locust caused by the locust leaf\r\n    miner.]\r\n\r\nUnder forested conditions no control is recommended. Rarely do trees die\r\nfrom attacks by this insect. Damage is objectionable mostly from an\r\naesthetic viewpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n           COTTONWOOD LEAF BEETLE, _Chrysomela scripta_ (F.)\r\n\r\nWillows, poplars, aspens and alders are attacked by the cottonwood leaf\r\nbeetle in the eastern United States. Cottonwood is the most important\r\nhost in the South. Damage has been especially severe in Louisiana and\r\nMississippi where thousands of acres of cottonwood plantations are\r\nintensively managed. Adult beetles and larvae feed on the foliage.\r\nDamage is most critical during the first three years after the\r\ncottonwood is planted. Adults chew holes in the leaves and may attack\r\nthe terminal shoots causing reduced growth or stem deformity. Young\r\nlarvae skeletonize the foliage but older larvae consume all foliage\r\nexcept the leaf midribs. Damage may become severe enough to cause\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cottonwood leaf beetle adult.]\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood leaf beetle overwinters in the adult stage. Eggs are laid\r\nin the spring. The female lays a cluster of about 75 yellowish eggs on\r\nthe underside of a leaf. As the larvae mature they become yellow with\r\nblack spots. After about nine days in the larval stage the beetle\r\ntransforms into the non-feeding pupal stage which lasts five to ten\r\ndays. The adult is about ¼-inch long and has a black head and thorax.\r\nThe wing covers are yellow with longitudinal black stripes. The life\r\ncycle is completed in 25 to 30 days and several generations occur in a\r\nsingle year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Larvae and pupae of the cottonwood leaf beetle.]\r\n\r\nControl may be needed in a plantation only during the first three years.\r\nChemical sprays have been successful in the past but at the present time\r\nno insecticides are registered for cottonwood leaf beetle control.\r\n\r\n\r\n              WALKINGSTICK, _Diapheromera femorata_ (Say)\r\n\r\nThe walkingstick is a defoliator of broadleaved trees in North America.\r\nThe black oaks, basswood, and wild cherry are the most common preferred\r\nhosts but numerous other hardwood species are attacked. This insect is\r\nwidely distributed over the United States east of the Rocky Mountains as\r\nwell as Manitoba and Ontario in Canada. At times, populations build in\r\nsufficient numbers to defoliate trees over large areas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Male walkingsticks feeding on oak.]\r\n\r\nThese slender, wingless, stick-like insects are pale green when young,\r\nbut gradually change to a dark green, gray, or brown at maturity. The\r\nadult female measures up to three inches in length and is more\r\nstout-bodied than the male. Mating usually takes place in August and egg\r\nlaying begins six to ten days later. The eggs are dropped to the ground\r\nwhere they overwinter in the leaf litter. In the northern part of the\r\nwalkingstick’s range the eggs take two years to hatch. In the South,\r\nwalkingstick eggs hatch the summer after they are laid, usually starting\r\nin mid-May. The newly hatched walkingstick looks like a miniature adult.\r\n\r\nParasitic wasps and flies are active against the immature walkingsticks\r\nbut are not efficient enough to cause a substantial population\r\nreduction. Flocks of robins, blackbirds, and grackles have a much\r\ngreater impact, however. The defoliation caused by walkingsticks\r\ngenerally occurs on upland sites in stands which are not of high value\r\nor intensively managed. For this reason there has been little interest\r\nin control.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GYPSY MOTH, _Porthetria dispar_ (L.)\r\n\r\nThe gypsy moth is an introduced forest insect. It was brought into this\r\ncountry from Europe in 1869 and has been restricted to the Northeast.\r\nThe gypsy moth feeds aggressively on oak, alder, apple, basswood,\r\nwillow, and birch. As the caterpillars reach maturity they will also\r\nfeed on hemlock, cedar, pine, and spruce.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Gypsy moth larvae.]\r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, the gypsy moth has a single generation per year,\r\noverwintering in the egg stage. Eggs hatch in late April and May and\r\nlarvae are present for approximately two months. Full-grown caterpillars\r\nmeasure more than two inches long and are easily identified by the five\r\npairs of blue spots and six pairs of red spots arranged in a double row\r\nalong the back. The adult moths are active from late June to early\r\nSeptember. Female moths, their bodies heavy with eggs, are unable to fly\r\nand must rely on a powerful sex attractant to lure male moths. This sex\r\nattractant has been chemically synthesized and is used as a trap bait in\r\nsurveys designed to determine the presence of gypsy moths in areas\r\nsuspected to be infested. Each female deposits from 200 to 800 eggs in a\r\nbuff-colored mass which she attaches to any convenient surface including\r\ncars, trailers, and other vehicles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Female gypsy moths depositing egg masses.]\r\n\r\nDuring the past 75 years the gypsy moth has been the target of many\r\nlarge-scale control programs, and much money has been spent trying to\r\nreduce the impact of gypsy moth infestations. Current control efforts\r\nare handicapped by the unavailability of a safe and effective persistent\r\nchemical. In the North two predators and nine parasites have been\r\nsuccessfully established to help control the gypsy moth. The greatest\r\nproblem in controlling gypsy moth spread, however, lies in the fact that\r\nrecreational vehicles transport egg masses and larvae from infested\r\nsites into uninfested areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n          HICKORY BARK BEETLE, _Scolytus quadrispinosus_ (Say)\r\n\r\nThe hickory bark beetle is reported to be the most serious insect pest\r\nof hickory in the United States. Population explosions where thousands\r\nof trees were killed have been reported from New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, and recently from Georgia. Hickory bark beetles are\r\ndistributed throughout the range of their host in eastern United States.\r\nAll species of hickory are subject to attack, as well as pecan and\r\npossibly butternut. Adult beetles emerge in May and June in the southern\r\nportion of their range. They feed for a short time by boring into the\r\npetioles of leaves and into small twigs of the host. Dying leaves and\r\ntwigs are the first evidence of attack. After feeding, the beetles fly\r\nto the trunk and larger branches of the host and bore into the inner\r\nbark to lay their eggs. Short, longitudinal egg galleries are etched\r\ninto the sapwood and from 20 to 60 eggs deposited in small niches cut on\r\neither side of the gallery. As the larvae develop, their galleries\r\nradiate out from the egg gallery. Two generations per year have been\r\nreported from northern Mississippi. The beetle overwinters in the larval\r\nstage. With the coming of warm weather in the early spring, it changes\r\ninto the pupal stage, and finally, in May, to an adult.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hickory bark beetle adult.]\r\n\r\nOutbreaks of this insect begin in periods of hot, dry weather and\r\nsubside when rains commence.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Larval galleries of the hickory bark beetle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SMALLER EUROPEAN ELM BARK BEETLE, _Scolytus multistriatus_ (Marsham)\r\n\r\nThe smaller European elm bark beetle was first reported in the United\r\nStates in 1909. Its presence in this country was given significance with\r\nthe introduction of the Dutch elm disease in 1930. The beetle attacks\r\nall native and introduced species of elms and now occurs wherever the\r\nhosts are present. The feeding of the adult beetles in the spring is\r\nresponsible for transmitting the Dutch elm disease from diseased to\r\nhealthy trees. The Dutch elm disease is now our most important shade\r\ntree disease.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Smaller European elm bark beetle adult.]\r\n\r\nAdult bark beetles emerge in the spring from dead or dying elms and\r\nbegin feeding on the twigs of healthy elms. The female then excavates an\r\negg gallery in the bark of dead or weakened elms. Eggs are deposited\r\nalong the walls of the gallery. The larvae, upon hatching, burrow into\r\nthe bark at right angles to the egg gallery. Pupation occurs at the end\r\nof the larval tunnel. New adults tunnel to the bark surface and leave\r\nthe tree through circular emergence holes. There are usually two\r\ngenerations a year. The beetles overwinter in the larval stage.\r\n\r\nChemical control and good tree maintenance are the two methods used to\r\nreduce bark beetle populations. Insecticides are used to prevent feeding\r\nby the adults in the spring. Tree sanitation involves removal and\r\ndisposal of dead elms and elm limbs which eliminate breeding and larval\r\ndevelopment sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n       COLUMBIAN TIMBER BEETLE, _Corthylus columbianus_ (Hopkins)\r\n\r\nAll hardwood trees in the eastern half of the United States are subject\r\nto attack by the Columbian timber beetle, but oaks, maples, birch,\r\nbasswood, yellow-poplar, and elm are the preferred hosts in the South.\r\nThe beetle causes two major types of damage: 1) physical damage caused\r\nby the 1/32″ to 1/16″ hole excavated by the adult into the sapwood, and\r\n2) degrade caused by stain which may extend for a considerable distance\r\nabove and below the gallery. Large diameter trees are preferred as\r\nhosts, but trees as small as one and one-fourth inches in diameter may\r\nbe attacked.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Callow adult and pupae of the Columbian timber\r\n    beetle.]\r\n\r\nThere are two and sometimes three generations of this insect each year.\r\nAdults from the first generation emerge from late May through June and\r\nthose from the second in October. The first evidence of attack is the\r\nwhite dust which collects at the entrance hole. Later, depending on the\r\ntree’s physiological condition, a sap-soaked area may develop around the\r\nentrance hole. The adult bores a horizontal hole into the sapwood of a\r\nhealthy tree for a few inches and later constructs two or three shorter\r\nlateral branches. “Cradles” (or egg chambers) are then constructed for a\r\nshort distance perpendicular to these galleries. The female deposits a\r\nsingle egg in each chamber. The offspring spend their entire\r\ndevelopmental period within the cradles feeding on fungi which grow on\r\nthe sapwood. It is this fungus which causes the extensive staining\r\ncharacteristic of Columbian timber beetle attack. Winter is spent in\r\nboth the pupal and adult stages in the brood galleries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Columbian timber beetle entrance holes in\r\n    yellow-poplar.]\r\n\r\nChemical control is not practical for forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n       COTTONWOOD TWIG BORER, _Gypsonoma haimbachiana_ (Kearfott)\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood twig borer is widely distributed throughout the entire\r\nrange of eastern cottonwood, from Canada to the Gulf States and west to\r\nMissouri. The larvae of the cottonwood twig borer feed in the terminals\r\nof the host. This feeding results in reduction of terminal growth and\r\nforked and crooked trunks. Damage is especially severe on young trees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cottonwood twig borer damage to cottonwood sapling.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Three-year-old cottonwood stunted by twig borers.]\r\n\r\nThe female moth lays eggs on the upper surface of leaves along the\r\nmid-rib, singly or in groups of two to eight. Hatching occurs in about\r\nfive days and the young larvae cover themselves with silk mixed with\r\ntrash, and then tunnel into the mid-rib. After the first molt, larvae\r\nleave the tunnels and bore into tender shoots. Larvae reach maturity in\r\nabout 21-23 days and begin moving down the trunk of the tree where they\r\nspin cocoons in sheltered bark crevices, in litter, or between leaf\r\nfolds. The adult moths emerge in eight or nine days. It takes from 40-45\r\ndays to complete the life cycle in mid-summer.\r\n\r\nThe most effective natural control is a potter wasp, _Eumenes_ sp. which\r\ntears open tender cottonwood shoots and removes twig borer larvae from\r\ntheir galleries. Other wasps parasitizing the twig borer include _Bracon\r\nmellitor_ (Say), _Apanteles clavatus_ (Provancher) and _Agathis_ sp.\r\n\r\n\r\n             COTTONWOOD BORER, _Plectrodera scalator_ (F.)\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood borer is limited in range to the southern half of the\r\nUnited States. Hosts include cottonwood, poplars and willows. The adults\r\nfeed on the tender shoots of young trees causing them to shrivel and\r\nbreak off. The larval stage of this insect tunnels in the inner bark and\r\nwood at the base of the tree and may kill or severely weaken it.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult cottonwood borer.]\r\n\r\nThe adult beetles appear in midsummer. After feeding briefly on the\r\ntender bark of the terminals the adults descend to the bases of host\r\ntrees where the female deposits her eggs in small pits gnawed in the\r\nbark. Eggs hatch in about three weeks. The larvae bore downward in the\r\ninner bark, entering a large root by fall. Larval feeding continues into\r\nthe second year as the larvae bore into the inner bark and wood. The\r\nlarvae transform into the non-feeding pupal stage and finally into an\r\nadult in the summer of the second year thus completing a two year life\r\ncycle. Adult beetles are 1¼ to 1½ inches long. They are black with lines\r\nof cream-colored scales forming irregular black patches.\r\n\r\nThe best control for the cottonwood borer is to maintain a vigorous,\r\nhealthy stand. Slow growing, off-site plantings of host trees are the\r\nmost severely damaged. While some systemic insecticides have shown\r\npromise, there is currently no registered chemical control method.\r\n\r\n\r\n               WHITE OAK BORER, _Goes tigrinus_ (De Geer)\r\n\r\nA recent survey of damage caused by various wood borers to three species\r\nin the white oak group revealed an estimated annual loss in the South\r\nexceeding 20 million dollars. One of the more important borers\r\nresponsible for this damage is the white oak borer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult white oak borer.]\r\n\r\nUsually the white oak borer attacks oaks one to eight inches in\r\ndiameter. The damage, like that of other hardwood borers, is the result\r\nof larval feeding in the wood. Galleries up to one-half inch in diameter\r\nextend upward through the sapwood into the heartwood. The white oak\r\nborer takes three to four years to complete one generation. The mated\r\nadult female beetle lays her eggs singly in the inner bark through a\r\nsmall oval niche chewed through the outer bark. After about three weeks\r\nthe eggs hatch and the larvae immediately bore into the sapwood. Later\r\nthey bore upward into the heartwood. The boring frass ejected out of the\r\nentrance is evidence of an active infestation. Pupation occurs behind a\r\nplug of excelsior-like frass at the upper end of the gallery in the\r\nheartwood. In about three weeks, adults emerge by boring separate and\r\nperfectly round holes through the wood and bark. In the South, adults\r\ngenerally emerge in May and June and feed for a short time on oak leaves\r\nand the tender bark of twigs before the females lay their eggs.\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers may destroy up to 25 percent of the larvae during the winter\r\nmonths, but this and the small toll taken by insect predators and\r\nparasites are not sufficient to keep the white oak borer population low\r\nenough to avoid serious economic loss.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Entrance and emergence holes in white oak.]\r\n\r\n\r\n              RED OAK BORER, _Enaphalodes rufulus_ (Hald.)\r\n\r\nThe red oak borer is a serious pest of trees in the red oak group. It\r\nranges throughout eastern North America wherever host species grow. It\r\nis estimated that defects caused by larval tunnels in the sapwood and\r\nheartwood of host trees costs the hardwood timber industry millions of\r\ndollars each year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult red oak borer.]\r\n\r\nEggs of the red oak borer are laid during early and mid-summer in bark\r\ncrevices or under patches of lichen on host trees. After hatching,\r\nlarvae bore into the inner bark region where they feed until mid-summer\r\nof the next year. This feeding in the inner bark causes characteristic\r\ncatfaces or bark pockets. Once larvae enter the wood they bore upward\r\nthrough the sapwood and into the heartwood and pupate behind a plug of\r\nexcelsior-like frass. The larval galleries are from one-fourth to\r\none-half inch in diameter, and six to ten inches long. Usually the\r\ngalleries are within six inches of the center of the tree. The adult\r\nemerges at the lower end of the tunnel, using a hole cut through the\r\nbark by the larva just prior to pupating. Adults emerge in June and\r\nJuly. The timing of the two-year life cycle of the red oak borer is such\r\nthat the adult population is greatest in odd-numbered years.\r\n\r\nGenerally, borers such as the red oak borer infest trees of poor vigor.\r\nIt is possible, therefore, to reduce borer populations by maintaining\r\nvigorous stands and by removing cull trees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Red oak borer attack on Nuttall oak.]\r\n\r\n\r\n             CARPENTERWORM, _Prionoxystus robiniae_ (Peck)\r\n\r\nThe carpenterworm bores in the wood of living hardwood trees, causing\r\ncostly damage to commercial timber species. In the South, oak species\r\nare preferred hosts but black locust, maples, willows, and fruit trees\r\nare also attacked. The carpenterworm is distributed throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Carpenterworm adults.]\r\n\r\nAdult moths emerge in late April to early June, mate, and the females\r\nlay groups of eggs in bark crevices or wounds. Each female lays 200 to\r\n500 eggs during her one-week life span. After hatching, the larvae\r\nwander over the bark for a short time before boring into the inner bark\r\nwhere they feed until half-grown. The larvae then bore into the sapwood\r\nand heartwood, returning occasionally to feed in the inner bark. The\r\nlarval period lasts from two to four years. Pupation usually occurs deep\r\nwithin the heartwood. Just prior to emergence, the pupa wiggles to the\r\nentrance hole where it remains slightly protruding until the adult moth\r\nemerges. The large winding tunnels constructed by the larvae in the\r\nsapwood and heartwood of living hardwoods serve as an entrance for\r\nwood-rotting fungi and insects such as the carpenter ant. In extreme\r\ncases, the tree may be structurally weakened and subject to wind\r\nbreakage.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Carpenterworm galleries in nuttall oak.]\r\n\r\nSome chemicals which have a fumigating action have proved effective in\r\ncontrolling this insect in shade trees, but no practical control has yet\r\nbeen found for forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n              PINE WEBWORM, _Tetralopha robustela_ (Zell.)\r\n\r\nUgly, compact masses of brown excrement or frass pellets around the stem\r\nof pine seedlings mark infestations of the pine webworm. Rarely is the\r\ndefoliation severe enough to kill the seedlings, but it undoubtedly has\r\nan impact on growth. Found throughout the eastern United States, the\r\nwebworm commonly attacks red, white, jack, loblolly, shortleaf, and\r\nslash pines.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine webworm damage to loblolly pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nThe adult moth has a wingspread of about one inch. The forewing usually\r\nis gray in the middle portion and darker at the base and tip. The hind\r\nwings and body are smokey gray. The full-grown larva is a caterpillar\r\napproximately ⅘ of an inch long. The head is tan with darker markings\r\nand the body light brown with dark longitudinal stripes running down\r\neach side.\r\n\r\nEggs are usually laid on seedlings, occasionally on larger trees,\r\nbetween May and September. After eggs hatch, the caterpillars live in\r\nsilken webs surrounded by masses of frass, and feed on the needles.\r\nGenerally each web contains one or two larvae but occasionally 25 or\r\nmore may be found. After feeding is completed, the caterpillars drop to\r\nthe ground and pupate below the soil surface. In the South, there are\r\nusually two generations each year.\r\n\r\nIn plantations, hand picking is an effective method of control. When\r\nhigh value nursery stock becomes infested, chemical control may become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n            BAGWORM, _Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis_ (Haw.)\r\n\r\nThe bagworm is distributed throughout the eastern half of the United\r\nStates. It is generally recognized as a defoliator of conifers,\r\nparticularly juniper, cedars, and arborvitae, but it is also found on\r\nmany hardwood trees including maple, wild cherry, poplars, oaks, and\r\napple.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bagworm cases on pine.]\r\n\r\nThe wingless, maggot-like adult female bagworms are present in September\r\nand October and spend their entire lives within the protective cover of\r\nthe tough, silken bag which they construct as larvae. Males are quite\r\nagile fliers and can often be seen in the fall flying around infested\r\nshrubs in search of a mate. Mating takes place through the open end of\r\nthe bag. Shortly thereafter the female deposits her egg mass containing\r\n500 to 1,000 eggs in her pupal case. The eggs remain in the bag\r\nthroughout the winter. In the deep South, hatching can occur as early as\r\nApril, but occurs in May or June further north. During the early stage\r\nof development, the larvae, housed in their tiny bags, are quite\r\ninconspicuous. As they mature, the bags become quite noticeable, and the\r\namount of foliage consumed increases rapidly.\r\n\r\nOutbreak populations of bagworm are in most cases quickly reduced by low\r\nwinter temperatures and a complex of several parasites. On shrubs and\r\nshade trees around a home, it is often practical to control bagworms by\r\npicking and destroying the bags.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PINE COLASPIS, _Colaspis pini_ (Barber)\r\n\r\nColaspis beetles are found throughout the Southeast, but are more common\r\nin the Gulf states. They seem to prefer slash pine but have been found\r\non many of the southern pines. The pine colaspis beetle is not a serious\r\nforest pest but feeding damage caused by large populations occasionally\r\nproduces a spectacular browning effect of the needles similar to that\r\ncaused by fire.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult pine colaspis beetle feeding damage on pine.]\r\n\r\nThe adult beetles chew the edges of needles to produce an irregular,\r\nsaw-like edge which turns brown. Occasionally only the tips of the\r\nneedles show signs of the infestation. Later, however, the entire needle\r\nmay die, causing the whole tree to become brown as though scorched by\r\nfire. Trees that have been attacked do not die, and little or no growth\r\nloss results. Attacks usually occur in early summer; by late summer the\r\ntrees appear green and healthy again. This pest is sporadic in its\r\noccurrence and may not develop again in the same area for several years.\r\nThe adult female lays her eggs in the soil during the summer. Larvae\r\nhatch and feed on roots of grasses and other vegetation, and overwinter\r\nin this stage. The larvae pupate in the spring; adults emerge in early\r\nsummer to feed. There is only one generation a year.\r\n\r\nUnder forest conditions, no control measures are recommended for the\r\npine colaspis beetle. On ornamentals and shade trees, insecticides can\r\nbe used to prevent unsightly damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n               PINE SAWFLY, _Neodiprion excitans_ (Roh.)\r\n\r\nThis pine sawfly is found throughout the southeast from Virginia to\r\nTexas. Loblolly and shortleaf pine are preferred hosts, but pond, slash,\r\nlongleaf, and Sonderegger pine are also attacked. The larvae do not do\r\nwell on the latter two species. As with most sawflies, the larvae feed\r\nin groups on the host needles. Generally the old needles are preferred,\r\nbut all of the needles are eaten when large numbers of larvae are\r\npresent. Three or four young larvae usually encircle a needle and,\r\nstarting from the tip, consume all but a central core. When nearing\r\nmaturity they eat the entire needle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine sawfly larvae.]\r\n\r\nFour or five generations of this sawfly may occur each year. Adult\r\nfemales begin to lay their eggs in slits cut in the needles during late\r\nMarch. The eggs hatch in 10-21 days, and the larvae feed for about five\r\nweeks. When mature the larvae usually crawl to the ground and spin a\r\ncocoon in the loose litter at the base of the tree. Although all stages\r\nof the life history can be found at any time during the growing season,\r\nthe peak adult emergence occurs in late summer. Larvae from this late\r\nsummer generation are responsible for most of the damage which, although\r\nnever directly responsible for mortality, may predispose the trees to\r\nattack by other insects (particularly bark beetles) and diseases.\r\n\r\nNatural control factors generally bring outbreak populations under\r\ncontrol after one season. Hogs, armadillos, mice, and shrews are\r\nreported as being of significant value in regulating the sawfly\r\npopulation. Insect parasites, predators, and disease are also effective\r\ncontrol agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ARKANSAS PINE SAWFLY, _Neodiprion taedae linearis_ (Ross)\r\n\r\nLoblolly and shortleaf pines are the only trees attacked by the Arkansas\r\npine sawfly. Periodic outbreaks of this insect over large areas in the\r\nsouth-central states cause substantial growth losses, but the insects\r\nseldom kill trees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Arkansas pine sawfly larvae.]\r\n\r\nThis insect has a single generation each year. In the spring, eggs which\r\nhave overwintered hatch into tiny caterpillar-like larvae. The larvae\r\nfeed in groups for 30-40 days (primarily on the older foliage) before\r\ncrawling to the ground and pupating in the topsoil or litter. Adults\r\nemerge during warm days in October and November, mate, and the females\r\nbegin laying eggs. Sawflies get their name from the manner in which the\r\neggs are laid. The female is equipped with a saw-like “ovipositor” with\r\nwhich she cuts a slit in the needle into which the egg is inserted. From\r\ntwo to ten eggs are laid in a single needle. Each female deposits from\r\n90 to 120 eggs.\r\n\r\nAn important natural control agent of this sawfly is a polyhedral virus\r\ndisease that sometimes destroys large numbers of the larvae. Rodents\r\ndestroy many cocoons. Several species of larval parasites are also known\r\nto exist. Of these, a parasitic fly, _Anthrax sinuosa_ (Wied.) and an\r\nichneumon wasp, _Exenterus canadensis_ (Prov.) appear to be the most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n        VIRGINIA PINE SAWFLY, _Neodriprion pratti pratti_ (Dyar)\r\n\r\nThe Virginia pine sawfly is found from Maryland to North Carolina, and\r\nwest to Illinois. The insect prefers Virginia and shortleaf pine, but it\r\nwill also oviposit and feed on pitch and loblolly pine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Virginia pine sawfly larva.]\r\n\r\nOn warm sunny days in late October and early November, the adult\r\nsawflies emerge from their cocoons in the litter, mate, and the females\r\nlay eggs. The female is equipped with a saw-like ovipositor with which\r\nshe cuts a slit at the edge of a needle and inserts a small, white, oval\r\negg. Several eggs are usually laid at evenly spaced intervals in each\r\nneedle, but in only one needle per fascicle. From 30 to 100 eggs are\r\ndeposited in this manner by each female. The eggs hatch the following\r\nApril and the young larvae feed gregariously on the old needles. Larval\r\ndevelopment is usually completed by the time the new needles come out,\r\ngiving heavily defoliated trees a tufted appearance. Mature larvae crawl\r\nto the ground and spin cocoons in the litter or surface soil. They\r\nremain as prepupae until late September when pupation occurs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine defoliated by the Virginia pine sawfly.]\r\n\r\nHeavy defoliation for two or more years can weaken trees and make them\r\nmore susceptible to other insects and diseases, particularly when\r\nassociated with drought. In commercial stands the growth loss caused by\r\nseveral years of 50% defoliation by this insect can amount to ⅓ of the\r\nexpected growth.\r\n\r\nSeveral parasites, predators, and a virus attack the Virginia pine\r\nsawfly, but weather conditions seem to be primarily responsible for the\r\ndrastic fluctuations in sawfly populations. Several chemicals have\r\nproven effective in preventing damage to ornamentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n          REDHEADED PINE SAWFLY, _Neodiprion lecontei_ (Fitch)\r\n\r\nThe redheaded pine sawfly did not become an important pest until\r\nextensive planting of pine in pure plantations began in the 1920’s.\r\nSince then, outbreaks in young natural pine stands and plantations have\r\nbeen common in the South, the north-central states, and eastern states.\r\nFeeding is primarily restricted to the two- and three-needled pines\r\nunder fifteen feet in height. Shortleaf, loblolly, longleaf, and slash\r\nare the species most commonly attacked in the southern states.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Redheaded pine sawfly larva.]\r\n\r\nIn the fall, sawfly larvae drop to the ground, spin cocoons in the duff\r\nor topsoil, and overwinter as prepupae in a small, brown cocoon. With\r\nthe coming of spring, pupation occurs and adult emergence follows in\r\nabout two weeks. Some prepupae may remain in a resting stage for more\r\nthan one season before emerging. Each female lays about 120 eggs. She\r\ncuts a small slit in the edge of a needle and deposits a single egg\r\ninside each slit. Eggs laid by a single female are generally clustered\r\non the needles of a single twig. Eggs hatch in three to five weeks,\r\ndepending on temperature and locality. Larvae feed gregariously on the\r\nhost for 25 to 30 days. When fully grown, larvae drop to the ground and\r\nspin their cocoons. In the South there are at least two generations per\r\nyear with a maximum of five being recorded. Colonies of different ages\r\nmay co-exist in the late fall or early winter.\r\n\r\nOutbreaks occur periodically and tend to subside after a few years of\r\nheavy defoliation. Numerous parasitic and predatory insects play an\r\nimportant role in causing the decline of infestations, as do adverse\r\nweather conditions during the larval stage. When deemed necessary,\r\nchemical treatment is an effective control.\r\n\r\n\r\n            TEXAS LEAF-CUTTING ANT, _Atta texana_ (Buckley)\r\n\r\nDamage caused by the Texas leaf-cutting ant, or town ant, is confined in\r\nthe United States to southeast Texas and west-central Louisiana. The ant\r\ncauses damage to a variety of green plants throughout the year and\r\ncauses serious damage to pine seedlings during the winter when other\r\ngreen plants are scarce. During this period, stands of young seedlings\r\nmay be completely defoliated and the stems girdled. The ant carries bits\r\nof needles, buds, and bark back to its nest to serve as the medium on\r\nwhich it cultivates a fungus. The fungus is the ant’s only known food.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Texas leaf cutting ant.]\r\n\r\nAnt colonies are characterized by numerous crescent-shaped mounds five\r\nto fourteen inches high, and by a series of well defined foraging trails\r\ncleared of vegetation. The mounds may be confined to a relatively small\r\narea or extend over an acre or more. Each mound serves as the entrance\r\nto a football-sized, hemispherical-shaped nest which the ants construct\r\nat depths up to 20 feet below the surface. The nests are interconnected\r\nby a series of narrow tunnels, and connected to lateral foraging tunnels\r\nwhich may surface a hundred yards or more from the colony. Leaf-cutting\r\nants, like many other social insects, are segregated into castes. The\r\nqueen dominates the colony and is responsible for its reproduction.\r\nLarge worker ants, or soldiers, provide protection from intrusion by\r\nother insects, while the smaller workers collect the leaves and tend the\r\nfungus gardens.\r\n\r\nVarious chemicals such as fumigants, contact poisons, and baits have\r\nbeen used to control the leaf-cutting ants with varying success. No\r\nnatural control has yet been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n         SOUTHERN PINE BEETLE, _Dendroctonus frontalis_ (Zimm.)\r\n\r\nProbably no other insect is of more concern to managers of southern pine\r\nforests than the southern pine beetle. Loblolly and shortleaf pine seem\r\nto be preferred hosts, but all of the southern pines may be attacked\r\nwherever they occur in North and Central America.\r\n\r\nAdult beetles are about the size of a grain of rice, stout and\r\nreddish-brown in color. While they commonly attack lightning-struck or\r\nweakened trees, they can also quickly build up to high populations\r\ncapable of successfully attacking healthy trees during periods favorable\r\nto their development. Adult beetles bore directly through the bark,\r\nmate, and the females begin to excavate S-shaped egg galleries in the\r\ninner bark. Eggs are deposited in niches on either side of these\r\ngalleries and hatch into small legless grubs within four to nine days.\r\nThe grubs mine for a short distance before boring into the outer bark\r\nwhere they pupate. There are from three to seven generations per year\r\ndepending on locality and weather. Drought seems to be associated with\r\nmajor outbreaks of this insect.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adults of the black turpentine beetle, the southern\r\n    pine beetle and three species of _Ips_ engraver beetles.]\r\n\r\nControl includes rapid salvage and utilization of infested trees and\r\npiling and burning of infested material. Outbreaks usually subside with\r\nthe advent of unfavorable weather and improved host vigor.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Southern pine beetle larval galleries.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Southern pine beetle pitch tubes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IPS ENGRAVER BEETLES, _Ips_ spp.\r\n\r\nWith the possible exception of the southern pine beetle, no other\r\ninsects cause as much mortality to southern pine forests as do the three\r\nspecies of _Ips_ engravers. Usually they attack severely weakened trees,\r\nlightning-struck trees, or fresh slash left by logging operations.\r\nDuring drought periods they can successfully attack otherwise healthy\r\npines.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine showing typical symptoms of _Ips_ attack.]\r\n\r\nAttacked trees are quickly girdled by the adults as they construct their\r\negg galleries in the inner bark. Death is usually hastened by the\r\nintroduction of blue-stain fungi which blocks the flow of sap. Small\r\nreddish pitch tubes are frequently the first sign of attack, but they\r\nare usually absent in trees suffering from drought. Peeling back the\r\nbark of an infested tree will reveal typical Y- or H-shaped egg\r\ngalleries with short larval galleries extending perpendicular to them on\r\neither side. _Ips_ beetles are easily recognized by their “scooped out”\r\nposteriors which are surrounded by varying numbers of tooth-like\r\nprojections. It takes only 18-25 days to complete one generation,\r\nallowing populations of these beetles to increase very rapidly during\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nAt present the best control is the speedy removal and utilization of\r\nactively infested trees, making sure that the bark and slabs are\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n       BLACK TURPENTINE BEETLE, _Dendroctonus terebrans_ (Oliv.)\r\n\r\nThe black turpentine beetle is found from New Hampshire south to\r\nFlorida, and from West Virginia to east Texas. It is a particularly\r\nserious pest in the Gulf States where recent outbreaks have killed large\r\nacreages of timber. Attacks have been observed on all pines native to\r\nthe Southeast, and also on red spruce.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Life stages of the black turpentine beetle: adult,\r\n    callow adult, pupa, larva and eggs.]\r\n\r\nThis is the largest of the southern bark beetles, varying in length from\r\n⅕ to ⅓ of an inch, or about the size of a raisin. They are reddish-brown\r\nto black in color. The beetle attacks fresh stumps and living trees by\r\nboring through the bark and constructing galleries on the face of the\r\nsapwood where eggs are laid. Fifty to 200 eggs are laid in a group. They\r\nhatch into white larvae which feed on the inner bark. The beetle may\r\ngirdle trees when several broods occur at approximately the same height,\r\nkilling the trees. From 70 to 90 percent of the trees attacked by the\r\nbeetle die.\r\n\r\nAfter the larvae complete their development, they pupate. Adult beetles\r\nemerge and infest more pine trees. The entire life cycle takes from 2½\r\nto 4 months, depending on temperature. In the insect’s southern range\r\nthere usually are two generations and part of a third each year. In its\r\nnorthern range, the third generation does not develop; consequently the\r\nbeetle is not a serious pest there.\r\n\r\nWeather is probably the most influential factor in regulating the\r\nnumbers of this insect. During outbreaks the removal or chemical\r\ntreatment of infested trees helps to keep losses to a minimum.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Close-up of black turpentine beetle pitch tubes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n              AMBROSIA BEETLE, _Platypus flavicornis_ (F.)\r\n\r\nAmbrosia beetles are represented in the South by several species of the\r\ngenus _Platypus_ of which only _P. flavicornis_ (F.) is known to attack\r\ndead or dying southern pines. _P. flavicornis_ (F.) will secondarily\r\ninvade other conifers and on some occasions may be found in hardwood\r\ntrees. It is so abundant in the South that few dying pines, stumps, or\r\nlogs escape attack. The beetle is found from Texas east to Florida and\r\nnorth to New Jersey.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult of the _Platypus_ ambrosia beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe adult is a reddish-brown elongate beetle approximately one-fourth\r\ninch in length. The male of the species has a pair of blunt tooth-like\r\nstructures on the third abdominal segment. Several males are usually\r\nfound in the presence of a single female. This species requires moist\r\nwood which is favorable to the growth of fungi upon which they feed. The\r\nadults bore into sapwood or heartwood of logs and lumber, making\r\npin-sized holes which are stained by the ambrosia fungus. The female\r\nlays eggs in small clusters in the tunnel and the developing larvae\r\nexcavate tiny cells extending from the tunnel parallel to the grain of\r\nwood. There may be several generations a year.\r\n\r\nAmbrosia beetle damage to green sawlogs and lumber may result in\r\nconsiderable degrade and strength reduction. The best control is rapid\r\nutilization of dead or dying trees. Lumber should be seasoned as soon as\r\npossible to reduce or eliminate losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SOUTHERN PINE SAWYERS, _Monochamus_ spp.\r\n\r\nIn the South, dying pines and fresh logs are quickly attacked by the\r\npine sawyers. In sufficient numbers they may cause a significant loss of\r\nwood fiber and degrade sawlogs. These species are commonly found in the\r\nSouth infesting southern pine, fir, and spruce wherever the hosts grow.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult southern pine sawyer beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe adults emerge in the spring or summer and begin to feed on the bark\r\nof twigs. After mating, the female gnaws pits through the bark of\r\nfreshly felled or dying pine. The female beetle lays one to several eggs\r\nin each pit. After eggs hatch the larvae bore beneath the bark for 40-60\r\ndays, converting the inner bark into coarse, shredded frass. The larvae\r\nthen enter the wood and make deep U-shaped cells through the heartwood\r\nand sapwood. The entrance is plugged with frass and the far end is\r\nexcavated into a pupal chamber. The larvae pupate the following spring\r\nor early summer, transform into adults, and emerge that same season. The\r\ninsect has two or three generations per year in the South.\r\n\r\nPine sawyers render storm- or fire-damaged pines unfit for salvage and\r\nare also a problem in wood-holding yards. Rapid salvage and utilization\r\nof dead or dying trees or green logs will reduce losses significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n       NANTUCKET PINE TIP MOTH, _Rhyacionia frustrana_ (Comstock)\r\n\r\nThe impact of the Nantucket pine tip moth on pine plantations varies\r\nwidely with tree species, host vigor, and environmental factors. Heavily\r\ninfested trees may be severely stunted or deformed but mortality is\r\nrare. Generally, the tree grows out of the susceptible stage within a\r\nfew years. In seed orchards, the tip moth is receiving increasing\r\nattention because of its impact on height growth and, more importantly,\r\nbecause of its effect on flower and cone production. All species of pine\r\nwithin the range of the tip moth except white pine and longleaf pine,\r\nare attacked. It has been reported from all states in the eastern\r\nhard-pine region extending across east Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, and southern New York State.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Nantucket pine tip moth larva on pine bud.]\r\n\r\nThe tip moths overwinter as pupae in the tips of infested trees. In the\r\nSouth the adults emerge on warm days during the late winter months,\r\nmate, and the females lay eggs in the axils between needles and stem\r\nnear the terminal bud of host trees. On hatching, larvae bore first into\r\nthe base of developing needles, and later into the new terminal growth\r\nor buds. There are two to four generations per year in the southern part\r\nof the tip moth’s range.\r\n\r\nChemical control is generally not considered practical in forest\r\nplantations, but several pesticides have proved effective in reducing\r\ninsect damage in seed orchards.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Newly emerged adult tip moth on a damaged shortleaf\r\n    pine tip.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PALES WEEVIL, _Hylobius pales_ (Hbst.)\r\n\r\nPales weevil is perhaps the most serious insect pest of pine\r\nreproduction in the southeastern United States. Losses in susceptible\r\nareas commonly run 20-25 percent, but exceed 90 percent under\r\ncircumstances favoring weevil development. Pales weevil is found\r\nthroughout pine-growing regions of eastern United States and Canada.\r\nFeeding has been reported on most coniferous species, and all species of\r\nsouthern pines appear to be susceptible in varying degrees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pitch-eating weevils in the genera _Pachylobius_,\r\n    _Hylobius_, and _Pissodes_.]\r\n\r\nAdult weevils are attracted by the odor of fresh pine resin, and quickly\r\ninvade logging areas. Eggs are laid in lateral roots of fresh pine\r\nstumps, where they hatch in approximately five to ten days. Larvae feed\r\non the inner-bark tissues of roots. At maturity, larvae usually\r\nconstruct a chip cocoon in a chamber cut into the wood, and pupate in\r\nthe cocoon. On emerging, adults feed on the tender bark of seedlings, or\r\ntwigs of trees. The small irregular feeding patches in the bark are\r\ncharacteristic of weevil damage. Heavy feeding girdles the stem or twig,\r\ncausing wilting and eventual death. Newly emerged adult females feed for\r\napproximately one month before laying eggs. Females may lay eggs\r\nsporadically through two growing seasons. The average female lays about\r\n50 eggs in her lifetime. In the South there are two peaks in adult\r\nweevil population each year; the first occurs in the early spring\r\n(March-May) followed by a second somewhat lower peak in July and August.\r\n\r\nThis insect can be controlled by delaying planting in cut-over areas for\r\nat least nine months, or by treating seedlings with a suitable\r\ninsecticide.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult pales weevil feeding on seedling.]\r\n\r\n\r\n              WHITE PINE WEEVIL, _Pissodes strobi_ (Peck)\r\n\r\nThe white pine weevil is generally regarded as the most serious insect\r\npest of white pine. Although it usually does not cause mortality, trees\r\nsuffering repeated attacks become stunted and deformed to the point of\r\nbeing commercially unusable. The weevil has become such a problem in\r\nsome areas that it prohibits the growing of white pine. In addition to\r\neastern white pine, the white pine weevils also attack Norway spruce and\r\njack pine. Other pines and spruces are attacked to a lesser degree. The\r\nweevil is found throughout the range of eastern white pine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine leader damaged by the white pine weevil.]\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of April, the adults may be found on the terminal\r\nshoots of host trees where the female lays her eggs. Up to 200 eggs are\r\ndeposited over a six-week period. The eggs are laid in feeding punctures\r\nin the bark, and hatch about two weeks later. Characteristically, the\r\nyoung larvae position themselves around the shoot and begin feeding as a\r\ngroup down the terminal through the inner bark. Small holes scattered\r\nover the bark are characteristic of white pine weevil attacks. After\r\nfive or six weeks the larvae construct pupal chambers in the pith or\r\nwood of the terminal shoot and transform into adults. The young adults\r\nremain in the dead terminal until late October and November when they\r\nmove to favorable overwintering sites on the ground, usually at the base\r\nof the host tree.\r\n\r\nControl of the white pine weevil is difficult. It is possible, however,\r\nto reduce the damage by making conditions in a young stand unfavorable\r\nfor egg laying. This is possible because the female weevil will only lay\r\neggs within a rather narrow range of temperature and relative humidity.\r\nVarious techniques involving the use of shade from “nurse trees” have\r\nbeen developed but require intensive management. Under certain\r\ncircumstances, chemical control can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n         PITCH-EATING WEEVIL, _Pachylobius picivorus_ (Germar)\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf Coast States the pitch-eating weevil is probably the most\r\ntroublesome insect pest of pine seedlings. No accurate figures are\r\navailable on the damage directly attributable to this pest, but\r\nmortality losses are estimated to average about 30 percent in\r\nsusceptible areas. All of the southern hard pines and other conifers are\r\nprobably suitable breeding and host material for the pitch-eating\r\nweevil. Its range overlaps that of the pales weevil, being reported from\r\nLabrador, Canada, south to Florida and west to Texas. It occurs in\r\ndamage-causing numbers only in the Gulf Coast States.\r\n\r\nPitch-eating weevils breed in the roots of freshly cut stumps. The\r\nadults burrow down through the soil, sometimes a considerable distance\r\nfrom the stump, and lay their eggs in niches chewed in the root bark. On\r\nhatching, larvae mine the inner bark, packing their galleries with\r\nfrass. Pupal cells are excavated in the sapwood, and a chip cocoon is\r\nconstructed from the excelsior-like material removed during the cells’\r\nconstruction. Development time varies from six to ten months depending\r\non when the stumps are initially infested. Emerging adult pitch-eating\r\nweevils feed by night on the tender bark of seedlings. Small irregular\r\npatches of bark are removed, eventually girdling the seedling and\r\ncausing its death. The pitch-eating weevil exhibits a population trend\r\nsimilar to that of the pales weevil, and is a threat mostly in early\r\nspring and in the fall.\r\n\r\nThe most effective control for pine reproduction weevils is to wait nine\r\nmonths before replanting or until the stumps in an area are no longer\r\nattractive to the weevil. Chemical control can be used when such a delay\r\nis considered impractical.\r\n\r\n\r\n              DEODAR WEEVIL, _Pissodes nemorensis_ (Germ.)\r\n\r\nThis snout beetle is very similar to the white pine weevil both in\r\nappearance and habits. It is found throughout the south- and\r\nmid-Atlantic states from southern New Jersey west to Missouri. Although\r\ndeodar cedar is the preferred host, Atlas cedar, Lebanon cedar, and\r\nseveral species of southern pines are also attacked.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Galleries and chip cocoons of the deodar weevil.]\r\n\r\nAdults emerge from April to May and feed briefly on the inner bark of\r\nleaders and lateral branches of host trees. Heavy feeding frequently\r\ngirdles the stem and can kill small trees. The adults are dormant during\r\nthe summer, but resume activity in the fall to lay their eggs. From one\r\nto four eggs are deposited in feeding punctures. The newly hatched\r\nlarvae bore into the inner bark where they construct winding galleries\r\nwhich girdle the stem. Evidence of such infestations is often delayed\r\nuntil January when the branches begin to turn brown. Winter is spent in\r\nthe larval stage. The larvae pupate in March or April and the cycle is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nKeeping shade trees in a vigorous condition by proper watering and\r\nfertilization helps reduce their susceptibility to weevil attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONEWORMS, _Dioryctria_ spp.\r\n\r\nConeworms are perhaps the most destructive insect pests of pine cones in\r\nthe South. They are particularly serious in superior-tree seed orchards\r\nwhere they frequently cause substantial economic loss. There are five\r\nimportant species of coneworms in the South, one or more of which attack\r\nall of the native and exotic pines.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Coneworm larva feeding on a pine shoot.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of generations per year varies with the species,\r\ntheir general life history is similar. Female moths lay their eggs\r\naround wounds, cankers, galls, etc., but also deposit particularly on\r\nterminal growth. Eggs generally hatch in about a week. Larvae may stay\r\nat a single feeding site, or move to several different sites before\r\ncompleting their development. This latter behavior often results in a\r\nsingle larva destroying several cones or shoots. Pupation takes place in\r\na chamber constructed by the larva at the feeding site. Depending on the\r\nspecies and time of year, the adult may emerge in two to three weeks or\r\noverwinter in the pupal stage. Coneworms cause several kinds of damage.\r\nThey may mine through the inner bark, bore up the center of a shoot, or\r\ncompletely hollow out a cone. Their attacks are sometimes marked by\r\nfecal pellets and large pitch masses.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Slash pine cone damaged by coneworm larva.]\r\n\r\nSeveral parasites attack coneworms but are seldom effective enough to\r\nprevent population build-ups. Chemical control is often necessary on\r\nseed orchards to ensure adequate protection of the cone crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PINE SEEDWORMS, _Laspeyresia_ spp.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years little has been known about pine seedworms. These\r\ninsects are found throughout the South but seldom have population\r\nexplosions. An exception to this is on slash pine in Florida where over\r\n70 percent of one year’s cones were reported infested. Longleaf pine\r\ncones in Texas and Louisiana have also had over 60 percent cone\r\ninfestation on occasion. Loblolly and shortleaf pine cones are seldom\r\nover 20 percent infested. Seedworms have been found infesting longleaf,\r\nloblolly, shortleaf, slash, and Virginia pine cones. _Laspeyresia\r\nanaranjada_ Miller attacks primarily slash pine, occasionally longleaf\r\npine, and rarely loblolly pine. _L. ingens_ Heinrick attacks primarily\r\nlongleaf and slash pine. _L. toreuta_ Grote attacks Virginia, shortleaf,\r\nand loblolly pine in the South.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Adult pine seedworm.]\r\n\r\nThe female moth lays eggs from April through May on second-year cones.\r\nThere is one generation per year. Larvae feed within developing seeds\r\nuntil the cone matures. In late fall, larvae either bore into the cone\r\naxis or remain in a hollowed-out seed, and overwinter. Pupation occurs\r\nwithin the cone and moths emerge through the hollow seeds. External\r\nevidence of seedworm attack is not visible in immature cones. As cones\r\nmature, damaged seeds are retained in the cone. Heavily damaged cones do\r\nnot open properly. In high-value seed orchards and seed production areas\r\nsome protection from seedworm attack may be obtained through the use of\r\npesticides applied in a carefully timed program.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pine seedworm larva in longleaf pine seed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n           BALSAM WOOLLY APHID, _Adelges piceae_ (Ratzeburg)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Eggs and wool-covered adult balsam woolly aphids.]\r\n\r\nThe balsam woolly aphid was introduced into northeastern North America\r\nfrom Europe around the turn of the century. Since then it has become a\r\npest of major importance to true firs on the east and west coasts of the\r\ncontinent, and threatens some 60,000 acres of Fraser fir in the southern\r\nAppalachians. Usually the balsam woolly aphid has two generations per\r\nyear in the southern Appalachians. Eggs of the first generation hatch in\r\nlate June and July followed by the second generation in September and\r\nOctober. The immature stage of the aphid known as a “crawler” is the\r\nonly motile stage in the aphid’s life cycle. Once the crawler begins\r\nfeeding, it transforms into an adult and never again moves. Reproduction\r\nis parthenogenic with each female laying approximately 100 eggs during\r\nher lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn the feeding process the aphid injects a salivary substance into the\r\nhost tree, which causes growth abnormalities. Initial symptoms of aphid\r\nattack may include “gouting” of buds or twig nodes and some twig and\r\nbranch die-back. Heavy stem attacks reduce the tree’s ability to\r\ntranslocate food and water. Usually a heavily infested tree dies within\r\ntwo to seven years.\r\n\r\nChemical control is effective but extremely costly and thus limited to\r\nvery high-value areas along scenic road-ways. Other control measures\r\ninclude removal and destruction of infested material.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fraser fir infested by balsam woolly aphid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NEEDLE CAST\r\n\r\nNeedle cast is a very common disease of conifers throughout eastern and\r\nsouthern United States. Eastern white, loblolly, longleaf, pitch, pond,\r\nshortleaf, table mountain, and Virginia pines are all susceptible.\r\n_Hypoderma lethale_ is probably the most common cause of needle cast on\r\nthe above hosts, with the exception of longleaf pine. _Lophodermium\r\npinastri_ is also associated with needle cast.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hypoderma needle cast on loblolly pine.]\r\n\r\nCurrent pine needles are infected in the early summer, and by winter or\r\nearly spring begin to turn brown at the tips. At this time the tree\r\nusually has a scorched appearance. Later, the browning progresses down\r\nthe needle and the fungal fruiting bodies are produced. These are small,\r\nblack, elongated structures known as hysterothecia, which open along a\r\nslit during moist weather to release their spores. The infected needles\r\nare often “cast,” leaving only the new growth, and causing the tree to\r\nhave a tufted appearance.\r\n\r\nControls are seldom needed for this disease in forest stands. Infected\r\ntrees usually recover and put out new foliage the year following heavy\r\nattacks. Nurseries or plantations should not be established in areas\r\nwhere needle cast is prevalent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Lophodermium needle cast on 2-0 nursery stock and 5\r\n    year old scotch pine, Spanish variety.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BROWN SPOT NEEDLE BLIGHT\r\n\r\nBrown spot or brown spot needle blight is caused by the fungus _Scirrhia\r\nacicola_. Brown spot occurs in all the coastal states from Virginia to\r\nTexas, and inland to Arkansas and Tennessee. All southern pines are\r\nattacked by the fungus, but only longleaf pine seedlings are seriously\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Brown spot needle blight on longleaf pine\r\n    reproduction.]\r\n\r\nInitial infection of pine needles results in the development of small,\r\ncircular spots of grey green color, which later turn brown. As the\r\nfungus continues to grow, a necrotic area encircles the needle,\r\nappearing as a brown band. The infected area will then increase in size,\r\neventually resulting in the death of the needle. Fruiting bodies, called\r\nacervuli, develop in the dead areas of the needle. Spores are extruded\r\nfrom the acervuli in a water soluble gelatinuous matrix throughout the\r\nentire year. The spores are washed apart and splashed short distances by\r\nrain drops. These spores spread the disease from seedling to seedling.\r\nDuring the winter and early spring, the sexual stage of the fungus is\r\nproduced on dead needles. Ascospores, produced in a fruiting body called\r\na perithecium, are light and wind-disseminated. These spores are\r\nresponsible for disease spread. During the grass stage, seedlings often\r\nbecome heavily infected by the brown spot fungus, resulting in partial\r\nto complete defoliation. Seedlings which are nearly defoliated every\r\nyear remain in the grass stage and eventually die. Three successive\r\nyears of complete defoliation will result in death. The disease is very\r\ndamaging during wet years, especially in areas where the fungus has\r\nbecome well established in the absence of controls.\r\n\r\nThe disease can be reduced by control burning during the winter months.\r\nOn seedlings, fire burns the diseased needles and reduces the amount of\r\navailable inoculum for reinfection, leaving the large terminal bud\r\nunharmed. Often a single prescribed burn reduces the disease intensity\r\nto such low levels that vigorous seedling height growth begins the\r\nfollowing year. Fungicide sprays will also reduce brown spot on high\r\nvalued trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PINE NEEDLE RUST\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting bodies of pine needle rust on loblolly\r\n    pine.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the native pines in southern United States are attacked by\r\nvarious needle rust fungi of the genus _Coleosporium_. This disease is\r\nvery common, but causes little harm to the trees. Many species of this\r\nrust also attack broadleaved weeds in addition to the pines, needing\r\nboth host types to complete their life cycle.\r\n\r\nNeedle rusts are most prevalent on young trees in the seedling to\r\nsapling stage. In the spring or early summer small, delicate white\r\nfungus “cups” filled with yellow to orange spores are produced on the\r\nneedles. From a distance entire seedlings may appear to have a whitish\r\nor yellowish cast. Individual needles which are heavily infected may\r\ndie, turn brown, and drop from the tree. However, the entire tree is\r\nrarely defoliated. Small red “rust pustules” form on the undersurface of\r\nthe weed leaves. These are replaced by dark structures later in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe needle rusts are not important enough to warrant control in natural\r\nforests or plantations. If the weed (alternate) host is known, it can be\r\neradicated around nurseries of susceptible pine species. However, it\r\nwould be better to establish nurseries in rust free areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CEDAR APPLE RUST\r\n\r\nCedar apple rust, caused by _Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae_, is\r\nimportant commercially in the apple-growing regions of the Virginias,\r\nCarolinas, and the Mississippi Valley. The alternate hosts of this rust\r\nare eastern red cedar and several species of junipers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting galls containing spores on cedar tree.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting on apple leaf the alternate host.]\r\n\r\nCedar “apples” or galls are the characteristic signs of the fungus on\r\ncedars. Cedar needles are infected in the summer by wind-borne spores\r\nfrom apple leaves. By the next spring or early summer galls begin to\r\nappear as small greenish brown swellings on the upper needle surfaces.\r\nBy fall, the infected needle turns into a chocolate brown gall covered\r\nwith small circular depressions. The following spring, orange jelly-like\r\ntendrils protrude from the galls producing an attractive ornament for\r\nthe cedar tree. Spores produced from these orange spore masses are then\r\ncapable of reinfecting apple leaves, thus completing the fungus life\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nNo practical control of the rust on cedars is available because of the\r\nlow value of cedar. However, considerable effort is expended to protect\r\napple trees. Where apple is to be protected, cedars should be eliminated\r\nin the vicinity or, rust galls should be picked or cut off cedars before\r\nthe galls mature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CEDAR BLIGHT\r\n\r\nCedar blight, caused by _Phomopsis juniperovora_, is most severe on\r\neastern red and Rocky Mountain cedars. Other hosts include arborvitae,\r\ncypress, and Atlantic white cedar. The disease ranges from the mid-West\r\nto the Atlantic coast and south to Alabama where it is most common in\r\nnurseries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Needle symptoms on 1-0 eastern red cedar nursery\r\n    stock and 5 year old Arizona cypress.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nSymptoms on red cedar resemble that of drought. The tips of branches are\r\nkilled back and sometimes entire trees will turn brown. The fungus forms\r\nblack fruiting bodies on needles and stem lesions. Fungus spores are\r\ndistributed by rainwater; nursery overhead sprinkling systems also\r\nfacilitate blight spread.\r\n\r\nControl of cedar blight is initiated by removing and burning infected\r\nnursery stock early in the season before infection becomes heavy.\r\nSeedbeds should be well drained. Avoid introducing cedar stock to an\r\ninfected nursery. The location of cedars in the nursery should be\r\nchanged frequently and, where possible, cedar beds should be kept well\r\naway from older cedar or cedar hedges. Seedlings growing in low-density\r\nseed beds are more vulnerable to the blight; thus beds should be fully\r\nstocked. Cedar mulch should never be used on cedar beds. Avoid wounding\r\nnursery transplants. No economically feasible control is available for\r\nforest stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FUSIFORM RUST\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Galls on 1-0 pine nursery stock.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Damage caused by fusiform rust infection.]\r\n\r\nFusiform rust, caused by _Cronartium fusiforme_, is one of the most\r\nimportant diseases on southern pines. This rust is found from Maryland\r\nto Florida and west to Texas and southern Arkansas. The rust’s most\r\nimportant impact is in nurseries, seed orchards, and young plantations.\r\nLoblolly and slash pines are very susceptible to this rust. Pitch and\r\npond pines are moderately susceptible, longleaf pine is fairly\r\nresistant, and shortleaf pine is highly resistant.\r\n\r\nThe most easily recognized symptom is the spindle-shaped canker on the\r\npine branches or main stem. In early spring these swellings appear\r\nyellow to orange as the fungus produces powdery spores. As host tissue\r\nis killed, older stem cankers may become flat or sunken. Cankers often\r\ngirdle trees and wind breakage at the canker is common. Fungus spores\r\nfrom the pine infect oak leaves. Brown hair-like structures, produced on\r\nthe underside of the leaves in late spring, are the most conspicuous\r\nsigns. These projections produce spores which in turn reinfect the pine\r\ntrees, completing a “typical” rust cycle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting fusiform-shaped canker on main stem of\r\n    southern pine.]\r\n\r\nSilvicultural practices may lessen the incidence of infection in\r\nplantations. Avoid planting highly susceptible species such as slash and\r\nloblolly pines in areas of known high rust incidence. In these areas\r\nmore resistant species such as longleaf or shortleaf pine should be\r\nplanted. Pruning infected branches will prevent stem infection in young\r\nplantations. Rust-resistant pines should be readily available from the\r\nnurseries in the near future. Culling out seedlings with obvious galls\r\nbefore outplanting will reduce the disease incidence in new plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHITE PINE BLISTER RUST\r\n\r\nWhite pine blister rust, caused by _Cronartium ribicola_, was introduced\r\nto North America on nursery stock about 1900. It is the most important\r\ndisease on white pine in the United States. In the South, the disease is\r\nfound on eastern white pine in the Appalachian mountains.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting cankers showing yellow-colored spores of\r\n    blister rust on eastern white pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by a fungus that attacks both white pine and wild\r\nand cultivated currant and gooseberry bushes, called _Ribes_. Both hosts\r\nmust be present if the fungus is to complete its life cycle. Attack by\r\nthe disease is followed by the development of cankers on the main stem\r\nor branches. Infected pines die when a canker completely girdles the\r\nmain stem or when many of the branches are killed by girdling. The most\r\nconspicuous symptoms of the disease are the dying branches or crowns\r\n(“flags”) above the girdling cankers, and the cankers themselves.\r\n\r\nInitially, a narrow band of yellow-orange bark marks the edges of the\r\ncanker. Inside this band are small irregular dark brown scars. As the\r\ncanker grows, the margin and bank of dark scars expand and the portion\r\nformerly occupied by the dark scars is now the area where the spores\r\nthat infect _Ribes_ are produced. During the months of April through\r\nJune white sacs or blisters containing orange-yellow spores (called\r\naeciospores) push through the diseased bark. The blisters soon rupture\r\nand the orange-yellow spores are wind-dispersed for great distances.\r\nGenerally, there is some tissue swelling associated with the canker,\r\nwhich results in a spindle-shaped swelling around the infected portion\r\nof the stem.\r\n\r\nLoss of white pines from blister rust can be prevented by destroying the\r\nwild and cultivated _Ribes_ bushes. Bushes may be removed by uprooting\r\nby hand, grubbing with a hand tool, or with herbicides. Pruning infected\r\nbranches on young trees will prevent stem infections and probably tree\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COMANDRA BLISTER RUST\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruit gall showing orange colored spores on loblolly\r\n    pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Alternate host—false toadflax.]\r\n\r\nComandra blister rust, caused by the fungus _Cronartium comandrae_, is a\r\ncanker disease of hard pines. The disease presently occurs in widely\r\nscattered areas throughout the western, central, and southern United\r\nStates. In the South, the primary hosts are loblolly, shortleaf, pond,\r\nand Virginia pine. Herbaceous plants of the genus Comandra, commonly\r\nknown as false toadflax or comandra, are also attacked.\r\n\r\nThe fungus infects pines through the needles and grows from the needle\r\ninto the branch or main stem where it forms a gall or canker. Dark\r\norange-colored spores which are produced on the surface of the gall in\r\nthe spring are wind-blown and infect the leaves or stems of the comandra\r\nplants. Two to three weeks after infection, urediospores are produced on\r\nthe underside of the comandra leaf. These are wind-blown and can only\r\ninfect other comandra plants. Eventually hair-like structures known as\r\ntelia are produced on the comandra leaves and stems. The telia produce\r\nspores which are wind-blown and infect the pine host through the needle.\r\nThe necessary combination of a susceptible pine host, the alternate\r\nhost, and the pathogen is presently known to occur only in northern\r\nArkansas, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.\r\n\r\nNo effective method of controlling the disease in forest stands is\r\npresently known. Silvicultural or forest management practices which\r\nreduce the abundance of the alternate host offer promise of long term\r\ncontrol. Maintenance of dense stands and heavy ground cover as a means\r\nof shading out the intermediate host plants, may be helpful in reducing\r\nrust damage in many areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EASTERN GALL RUST\r\n\r\nEastern gall rust, caused by the fungus _Cronartium cerebrum_, attacks\r\nmany species of eastern hard pines. The disease ranges eastward from the\r\nGreat Plains and is most severe in the South on Virginia and shortleaf\r\npines. Like most rusts this fungus requires an alternate host in\r\naddition to its pine host. In this case oaks, especially the red oak\r\ngroup (black, red, scarlet and pin) are the alternate hosts. Damage to\r\nthe oaks is generally not of economic importance as only the leaves are\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting gall showing red-orange spores on Virginia\r\n    pine.]\r\n\r\nOn pines the fungus causes the formation of globose to sub-globose\r\ngalls. Canker formation occurs occasionally but mortality generally\r\nresults from wind breakage at the gall rather than by canker formation\r\nas literally hundreds of galls may appear on a single tree. They are not\r\nlethal to the tree, but may ruin tree form and on a large stem they can\r\nlead to an open decayed wound, as decay fungi are often secondary\r\ninvaders of rust infections. The shape of galls and the arrangement of\r\nthe spore sacs filled with red-orange spores present a cerebroid\r\n(brain-like) appearance. During the spring the bright orange galls are\r\nvery striking.\r\n\r\nThis disease is sometimes a problem in nurseries where seedlings are\r\nattacked and killed. This is where control efforts are concentrated.\r\nFungicide protectants are applied to the seedling foliage to prevent\r\ninfection from spores produced on oaks. Contact your local forestry\r\nextension agent or the nearest Division of Forest Pest Management for\r\nthe latest recommendations. Under forest conditions, control is not\r\neconomically feasible. Trees of poor form should be removed during\r\nthinning operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOUTHERN CONE RUST\r\n\r\nSouthern cone rust is caused by the fungus _Cronartium strobilinum_. It\r\nhas been reported to completely destroy slash and longleaf pine cone\r\ncrops in Georgia and along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cone rust symptoms on slash pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nLike most other rusts, the fungus requires oaks and pines to complete\r\nits life cycle. Although infection of oak leaves occurs annually, no\r\nsignificant economic damage is done to the oaks. Fungus spores produced\r\non oak leaves infect the mature female pine flowers about the time of\r\npollination (January-February). The fungus grows through the developing\r\nconelet causing it to swell abnormally. By early April or late May the\r\ninfected cones are three to four times larger than the normal first-year\r\ncones and even exceed the maturing second-year cones in size. The\r\nswollen cone scales are reddish in color. Cavities in the cone filled\r\nwith orange-yellow spores burst and the cones become orange-yellow. The\r\nswollen orange-yellow cones in the tree crowns can be easily\r\ndistinguished from normal cones by an observer on the ground. By late\r\nsummer most of the diseased cones have died and fallen.\r\n\r\nControl at present is confined to seed orchards. Hydraulic spraying of\r\nthe flowers with fungicides gives a significant reduction in infections.\r\nConsult your local forester, county extension agent or the nearest\r\nForest Pest Management Office for current control recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PITCH CANKER\r\n\r\nPitch canker, caused by the fungus _Fusarium lateritium forma pini_, is\r\nrapidly becoming widespread throughout the South. The disease apparently\r\nis most serious on Virginia, slash and south Florida slash pine. The\r\nfungus also attacks shortleaf, pitch, and table-mountain pine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pitch canker infection in terminal branch and main\r\n    stem of pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nPitch canker may cause tree mortality. On Virginia pines the fungus\r\nreportedly enters through small insect wounds in the twigs or mechanical\r\nwounds in the bole. Shoots may be girdled and killed within a few weeks,\r\nbut it takes a period of years for the fungus to girdle the bole of\r\nlarger trees. On slash pine the disease apparently attacks plantations\r\nin wave years. During years of heavy attack the fungus can cause rapid\r\ncrown deterioration in addition to causing bole canker infections.\r\nCankers on leaders in the crown can result in death of two-thirds or\r\nmore of the crown by mid-summer in a tree that appeared healthy in the\r\nspring. In the majority of tree infections only the leader and one or\r\ntwo laterals will be infected. The tree recovers in a few years with a\r\ncrook in the bole as the only evidence of attack. Pitch cankers usually\r\nretain the bark and old cankers on the hole may be sunken. The most\r\ndiagnostic characteristic of the disease, and the one that definitely\r\nseparates it from similar disease, is the heavy pitch soak of the wood\r\nbeneath the canker. Pitch cankers are often so soaked with pitch that\r\nheavy flow of pitch is observed flowing down the bole.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, no known method of control exists. Observations in\r\nslash pine plantations indicate that some trees are resistant while\r\nothers range in their degree of susceptibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WOOD DECAY\r\n\r\nWood decay of southern forest trees is responsible for nearly 80 percent\r\nof all loss attributed to disease. This decay is caused by fungi which\r\nmainly attack heartwood in the central portion of stems, branches, and\r\nroots. Wood-rotting fungi gain entrance into the tree through broken\r\nbranches, wounds, and damaged or exposed roots. Spores, which land at\r\nthese damaged areas, germinate and produce a microscopic mycelium which\r\nattacks and spreads throughout the heartwood. The decay is caused by the\r\naction of the mycelium, which penetrate the cell walls and dissolve or\r\nalter the wood in various ways. Fungus development within the tree may\r\ncontinue for many years without any apparent effect on the growth of the\r\nhost. Eventually the mycelium will aggregate and break through the bark\r\nto form the reproductive stage, either before or after the death of the\r\nhost. The fruiting body (sporophore, conk) produces vast amounts of\r\nspores which are capable of spreading the fungus to other trees.\r\n\r\nHeartrots may be separated into broad classes on the basis of the host\r\nportion attacked, such as root rots, root and butt rots, stem rots, and\r\ntop rots. Decay fungi may be further separated into two broad classes\r\nbased on their effect on wood. The first class causes white rots,\r\ndecomposing all components of the wood and reducing it to a spongy mass\r\nwith white pockets or streaks separated by firm wood. The second class,\r\ncausing brown rots, utilize the cellulose, leaving the lignin more or\r\nless unaffected. This usually results in a rot which appears as some\r\nshade of brown.\r\n\r\nThe separation of wood decay fungi on the basis of their host range, the\r\nportion of the host attacked, and the type of rot produced are useful\r\naids to a pathologist in determining a tentative identification of the\r\nfungus responsible for a particular type of rot. However, there are\r\nnumerous fungi which cause decay, many of which are exceptions to the\r\nvarious methods of classification. This forces the pathologist to use\r\nmicroscopic examination and various artificial keys to arrive at the\r\nproper identification of a given rot-producing fungus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sectioned stump showing rot and decay in heartwood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RED HEART\r\n\r\nThe fungus, _Fomes pini_, is the cause of a heartrot of widespread\r\ndistribution. Common names for the rot produced by this fungus are: red\r\nheart, red ring rot, or white peck. The disease is commonly associated\r\nwith mature and over-mature conifers, especially Douglas fir, larch,\r\nspruce, and pine. In the southern United States, the fungus attacks all\r\nspecies of mature pine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of redheart on southern pine.]\r\n\r\nGenerally, infection of all hosts occurs through dead branch stubs.\r\nEarly stages of decay caused by _F. pini_ are characterized by a\r\ndiscoloration of the heartwood, often appearing light red to reddish\r\nbrown. The advanced stages of heartrot appear as elongated white pockets\r\nor flecks, formed parallel to the grain and separated by apparently firm\r\nwood. Often the pockets become resin filled. On southern pine hosts, the\r\nconks are often bracket-like or hoof-shaped. The upper surface appears\r\ndull grey to dark brown, with concentric furrows parallel to the margin\r\nof the fruiting body. The lower side is a light brown to brownish gold,\r\nrimmed by a velvety golden brown margin. Swollen knots result from the\r\nliving wood tissue trying to overgrow the knot where a conk is forming.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross section of infected tree showing rotted and\r\n    decayed heart wood.]\r\n\r\nIn southern forest stands, heartrot damage may be reduced by harvesting\r\nmature pines prior to the age of extreme susceptibility to fungus\r\nattack. Some degree of shade tree protection can be obtained by pruning\r\ndead and dying branches flush with the main stem. This will allow the\r\nknot to be quickly overgrown by sap wood, preventing the heartrot fungus\r\nfrom entering through the branch stub.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ANNOSUS ROOT AND BUTT ROT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fomes annosus fruiting bodies on stump.]\r\n\r\nAnnosus root and butt rot is caused by the fungus _Fomes annosus_. This\r\npathogen is common throughout coniferous stands of the North Temperate\r\nZone. Hardwoods may be attacked, but damage is usually of minor\r\nconsequence. In the South, the disease is most serious in pine\r\nplantations on sandy soils with low organic matter. All species of\r\nsouthern pine are susceptible. Slash and loblolly plantations are often\r\nseverely affected.\r\n\r\nThe disease gains entry into plantations by spore infection of freshly\r\ncut stumps during thinnings. The fungus then spreads from the infected\r\nstumps to residual trees by growth along the roots to points of root\r\ncontact. Residual trees usually begin to die within a few years after\r\nthinning. The sporophores or fruiting bodies are generally found at\r\nground line or in the root crotch. Pines in initial stages of the\r\ndisease usually exhibit sparsely foliated crowns; however, white pine\r\nwith full crown may have extensive butt and root decay. Occasionally\r\ntrees may die rapidly with a sudden red discoloration of a nearly full\r\ncrown. Diseased trees are often found in groups or circular pockets in\r\nthe stand. The indication of _F. annosus_ decay may include the pink to\r\nviolet stain of incipient decay, the narrow elongated white pockets and\r\nscattered black flecks in the wood of the early decay stages, and the\r\nyellow stringy rot of the late stages of decay.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Infection center in pulpwood size pine stand.]\r\n\r\nControl includes avoidance of planting on soils of low organic matter\r\nand elimination of thinning. Stump infection following thinning or\r\nharvest may be prevented using various methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BROWN CUBICAL BUTT ROT\r\n\r\n_Polyporus schweinitzii_ is a common cause of root and butt rot of\r\nconifers throughout North America. The primary hosts of the fungus are\r\nDouglas fir, spruce, and pine. All southern pines are susceptible to\r\nattack by _P. schweinitzii_. Common names of the rot are: red-brown butt\r\nrot and brown cubical butt rot.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of brown cubical root and butt rot of\r\n    pine.]\r\n\r\nThe fungus enters living hosts through damaged roots, fire scars, and\r\nother wounds near the tree base. The initial stage of decay appears as a\r\nlight yellow stain. In the advanced stage, the heartwood becomes brittle\r\nand breaks into large yellow-brown to reddish-brown cubes. The fungus\r\ndevelops primarily in the roots and butt and seldom extends more than 15\r\nor 20 feet up into the stem. Diseased trees are subject to wind-throw\r\nand wind breakage. Although the volume of wood destroyed by the rot is\r\nsmall, the total volume lost through wind-throw is quite large. Mature,\r\nsuppressed, and weakened off-site trees are commonly attacked by the\r\nfungus. It is assumed that the fungus may also spread from infected to\r\nhealthy trees through root contacts and grafts. The only outward signs\r\nof decay are the annual sporophores, which develop in late summer and\r\nfall during moist weather. Conks formed at the base of infected trees\r\nare bracket shaped, while those arising from decayed roots appear\r\ncircular, sunken in the center, and supported by a short stalk. When\r\nfresh, the upper surface is velvety, concentrically zoned, and\r\nreddish-brown in color with a light yellow margin. The underside is dark\r\nolive or green with large irregular pores.\r\n\r\nIn forest stands, no method of controlling the disease is known. Losses\r\nmay be prevented to some extent by reducing the amount of root damage\r\nand wounding from heavy logging equipment. The prevention of basal fire\r\nscars in conifer stands will also reduce the incidence of this disease.\r\nTrees which show signs of advanced root and butt rot should be removed\r\nfrom around recreation areas, parking lots, power lines, and buildings\r\nto avoid damage from wind-throw and wind breakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RED ROOT AND BUTT ROT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of red root and butt rot of pine.]\r\n\r\n_Polyporus tomentosus_ causes red root and butt rot of living conifers\r\nthroughout North America. Common hosts of the fungus are: spruce, larch,\r\npine, fir, Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar. Throughout the southern\r\nUnited States, _P. tomentosus_ has been reported in two general areas;\r\ncausing extensive degrade of mature shortleaf pine in northern Arkansas\r\nand root and butt rot of slash pine in South Carolina, Georgia, and\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nThe fungus is believed to enter living hosts through basal wounds and\r\ndamaged roots. Under ideal conditions, the fungus may spread from\r\ninfected to healthy trees by way of root contacts or grafts. Growth of\r\nthe fungus is very slow, often causing host mortality 20 to 30 years\r\nafter initial infection. Wood decayed initially appears firm, but dark\r\nreddish-brown in color. In advanced stages, the wood is flecked with\r\nelliptical white pockets separated by brown-colored wood. Infected\r\nconifers generally express typical root rot symptoms. Trees show\r\nevidence of reduced radial and internodal growth, accompanied by death\r\nof the crown from the base upward. The foliage appears off-color and\r\nreduced in length. Under moist conditions, sporophores are produced\r\neither at the base of infected trees or on the forest floor.\r\nBracket-shaped sporophores are produced at the base of infected trees\r\nwhile stipitate conks are produced on the ground directly over infected\r\nor dead roots. Fresh sporophores appear yellow-brown in color from above\r\nwith a lighter colored pore surface below.\r\n\r\nNo effective method of controlling the disease in forest stands is\r\npresently known. However, damage and losses may be reduced by management\r\npractices which reduce or eliminate the chance introduction of the\r\ndisease into healthy stands. In areas where red root and butt rot is\r\ncommon, attempts should be made to conduct logging and thinning\r\noperations during the dry season to avoid mechanical damage to the root\r\nsystems of the residual trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LITTLELEAF OF PINE\r\n\r\nLittleleaf of pine, caused by _Phytophthora cinnamomi_, is the most\r\nserious disease of shortleaf pine in the Piedmont region of the South.\r\nLoblolly is also affected, usually where associated with infected\r\nshortleaf pine. The disease is most evident in older age classes, rarely\r\nattacking stands under 20 years old.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Needle symptoms and damage of littleleaf on shortleaf\r\n    pine.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by a malfunctioning of the root system due to a\r\ncombination of biological and physical factors. A fungus, _Phytophthora\r\ncinnamomi_ attacks and kills the root tips. When conditions of moisture,\r\nfertility, and drainage are adverse, they reduce tree vigor and prevent\r\nthe tree from rapidly replacing the destroyed root tips. Trees on good\r\nsites are reportedly also attacked by the fungus, but their vigor is\r\nsuch that they quickly overcome the disease by producing new root tips.\r\nThe disease usually progresses rather slowly. Some trees may persist\r\nfifteen or more years after the appearance of initial symptoms. In\r\ngeneral, trees live only five or six years after attack, but they may\r\ndie in as little as one year. Symptoms are those typical of trees in\r\nstress due to a malfunction of the root system. In the early stage of\r\nthe disease the foliage may turn yellow-green and the current year’s\r\nneedles are shorter than normal. Later stages of the disease are\r\nsparsely foliated crowns with short needles (reduced from three to five\r\nto only one-half to three inches in length) and dead branches. Abundant\r\nfoliage sprouting on the hole of infected shortleaf is common.\r\n\r\nLosses are minimized by salvage cuttings and by favoring loblolly and\r\nhardwoods in regeneration plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SYCAMORE ANTHRACNOSE\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Defoliation of sycamore tree caused by sycamore\r\n    anthracnose.]\r\n\r\nSycamore anthracnose, caused by _Gnomonia veneta_, is common on American\r\nsycamore throughout its range in the eastern United States.\r\n\r\nAnthracnose is a disease characterized by distinctive limited lesions on\r\nstem, leaf, or fruit, often accompanied by dieback or blight and usually\r\ncaused by fungi that produce slimy spores that ooze from small\r\ncup-shaped fruiting bodies that are visible with a hand lens. This\r\ndisease has four distinct symptom stages identified as twig blight, bud\r\nblight, shoot blight, and leaf blight. Twig blight appears before leaf\r\nemergence and kills the tips of small one-year-old twigs. Infection\r\ncomes initially from leaf litter and twig cankers. The second stage, bud\r\nblight, develops during bud expansion in April and early May. Shoot\r\nblight, the most frequently observed symptom, causes the sudden dying of\r\nexpanding shoots and also young leaves. Leaf blight, the final stage,\r\ninvolves the actual infection of expanding or mature leaves. Diseased\r\nportions of the leaf involve irregular brown areas adjacent to the\r\nmidrib and veins which are dotted with diseased spots. Incidence of\r\nanthracnose is directly related to the amount of spring rainfall. Shoot\r\nblight is severe if the weather for two weeks after leaf emergence is\r\ncool and moist. The disease may defoliate trees, which usually put out a\r\nnew crop of leaves by late spring or summer.\r\n\r\nControl of sycamore anthracnose under forest conditions is not\r\neconomically feasible. Where the disease is prevalent, other species\r\nshould be favored during thinnings. In shade and ornamental trees,\r\npruning of infected twigs, burning of leaves, and fertilization will\r\nreduce the disease impact.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Leaf and twig symptoms.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WALNUT ANTHRACNOSE\r\n\r\nWalnut anthracnose is a fungus disease caused by _Gnomonia leptostyla_.\r\nThis worldwide disease attacks most species of walnut in the United\r\nStates. Black walnut is most severely affected, but with favorable\r\nweather for the fungus, even less susceptible individuals may be\r\ndefoliated. Butternut, Persian walnut, and two species from California\r\n(Hinds walnut and California walnut) are all susceptible. Anthracnose\r\nhas also been reported on species of walnut from most of the European\r\ncountries, Argentina, Canada, and South Africa.\r\n\r\nWet weather greatly favors this leaf disease which may defoliate black\r\nwalnuts by late July or early August. Defoliation slows growth, weakens\r\ntrees, and sometimes causes mortality. Infected leaves reveal circular\r\nspots of dark brown or black. These spots often grow together, leaving\r\nlarge dead areas. These spots or blotches are bordered with yellow to\r\ngolden tissue. While severely affected leaves fall, some “anthracnose”\r\nleaves remain on the tree. This disease also affects the growth and\r\nquality of the nuts. Nutmeats from infected trees are dark,\r\nunattractive, and shrivelled. Sunken, killed areas appear on the husks\r\nas dark circular spots smaller than those on the leaves. Infected nuts,\r\nlike the leaves, may also fall from the tree. Lesions may appear on the\r\ncurrent year’s shoots and later form dead sunken areas that are oval to\r\nirregularly circular with reddish brown margins.\r\n\r\nAs with the other anthracnose diseases, no practical control is\r\navailable for forest trees. Control of walnut anthracnose on ornamentals\r\nand nut trees is partially achieved by raking and burning of old leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OAK ANTRHACNOSE\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Leaf symptoms of oak anthracnose.]\r\n\r\nOak anthracnose is caused by the fungus _Gnomonia veneta_. Trees of the\r\nwhite oak group, particularly white oak, are susceptible to this\r\ndisease. Oaks throughout the entire eastern United States are affected\r\nby the disease, although it is less common in the Northeast.\r\n\r\nInfection occurs in the early spring or mid-summer. Symptoms on leaves\r\ndevelop as irregular brown diseased areas (blotches) along the midrib\r\nand the major side veins. These blotches may grow together by late\r\nspring or early summer if infection occurs early. Blotches are usually\r\nconfined to the areas bordered by the larger veins. Leaves on the lower\r\nbranches are frequently killed and occasionally trees will be\r\ndefoliated. However, a second crop of leaves soon develops and mortality\r\nis rare. Fruiting bodies of _Gloeosporium_, the imperfect fungus\r\nfruiting stage of anthracnose, are located on the midrib and veins of\r\ninfected leaves. When the disease spreads to the twigs, cankers and\r\ncrown dieback may occur. The anthracnose fungus overwinters on diseased\r\ntwigs and in the leaf litter. Oak anthracnose has the same causal agent\r\nas sycamore anthracnose, and the weather conditions favoring the\r\nsycamore disease also increases the anthracnose on oak.\r\n\r\nControl is similar to sycamore anthracnose and involves an integrated\r\nprogram of pruning disease tissue, fertilization, and burning of leaf\r\nlitter. No practical control is available for forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DOGWOOD ANTHRACNOSE\r\n\r\nDogwood anthracnose, caused by the fungus _Elsinoe corni_, occurs in\r\nstates bordering the Atlantic Ocean and has also been reported in\r\nLouisiana. Its primary host is flowering dogwood, _Cornus florida_ L.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Leaf and flower symptoms of dogwood anthracnose.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nAnthracnose occurs in the spring and affects not only the leaves, but\r\nalso the buds and “flowers”. The buds may fail to open or they may\r\nproduce stunted flowers. These have many circular to elongated spots\r\nwith light tan centers. Margins of these spots are purple to brown.\r\nOften the flowers abort before development. Foliage spots (1-2 mm. in\r\ndiameter) are raised at the margins. They are purple at the edges and\r\nyellow-gray in the center. Later centers of spots may fall out causing a\r\n“shothole” effect. Dozens of spots may be present on a single leaf and\r\nmay be scattered or concentrated at tip, margin, or midrib. Twisting and\r\nmalformation of the leaves are common. In addition to floral and foliage\r\nspots, infected areas may also occur on petioles, stems, and fruit\r\nclusters. All three areas have spots similar to those on the foliage.\r\n\r\nOther diseases which may be confused with anthracnose include _Septoria_\r\nand _Ascochyta_ leaf spots. _Septoria_ usually begins around July and\r\nunlike anthracnose has more angular lesions that are between the veins.\r\n_Ascochyta_ spots may be larger (6 mm. in diameter) than anthracnose,\r\nand tissue discoloration may extend outside of their borders.\r\nOccasionally the leaves may totally blacken. This disease may occur as\r\nearly as June.\r\n\r\nWet, humid weather at certain stages of plant development is required\r\nfor infection. Homeowners may obtain effective control by removing and\r\nburning infected plant parts. Various fungicide sprays are recommended\r\nby authors of ornamental handbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COTTONWOOD RUST\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rust infected cottonwood leaf.]\r\n\r\nCottonwood rust, caused by _Melampsora medusae_, is probably the most\r\nimportant leaf disease of cottonwoods wherever they are grown. In the\r\nLower Mississippi Valley, all sizes of eastern cottonwood trees may be\r\ninfected with this rust. However, the disease is probably of most\r\nimportance in cottonwood nurseries.\r\n\r\nIn mid-summer, yellow to orange pustules containing spores of the fungus\r\nform on the under surface of the cottonwood leaves. In late summer and\r\nearly fall, dark brown fungal growths replace the orange structures.\r\nCottonwood may be prematurely defoliated or even killed by successive\r\nattacks. The rust may weaken trees and subject them to attack by other\r\ndisease-causing organisms. Also, there is often a reduction in growth in\r\nthese normally fast growing species. This is very important since there\r\nis presently a wide interest in the use of hybrid poplars for pulp and\r\ntimber production.\r\n\r\nThere is generally no accepted control for cottonwood rust.\r\nRust-resistant varieties of hybrid and exotic cottonwoods are being\r\ndeveloped and may provide the best control of this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BLACK KNOT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Black swellings of cherry black knot.]\r\n\r\nBlack knot, caused by _Dibotryon morbosum_, is prevalent throughout the\r\nSoutheast (with the exception of southern Florida) wherever black cherry\r\ngrows, and in orchards on plums and domestic cherries.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent symptoms are the elongated black swellings which\r\nappear in summer on small twigs and branches. Heavily infected trees\r\nappear quite grotesque, with large swellings which may be several times\r\nthe diameter of the twigs. Cankers occurring on black cherry trunks\r\nusually ruin the commercial tree value. Initial infection occurs on\r\nlateral branches and twigs in the spring, but the swellings do not\r\nbecome noticeable until the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe most practical control for black knot is removal of infected black\r\ncherry from the stand. Twigs and branches with knots should be burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NECTRIA CANKER\r\n\r\nNectria canker of hardwoods, caused by _Nectria galligena_ and _N.\r\nmagnoliae_, is frequently found on yellow birch and black walnut. Common\r\nhosts also include bigtooth aspen, sassafras, northern red oak, red\r\nmaple, beech, Carolina poplar, paper birch, and sweet birch. A closely\r\nrelated canker disease is also found on yellow-poplar and magnolias. The\r\nrange of this disease includes the Lake States, the Northeast, and the\r\nsouthern Appalachians.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Target-shaped canker of Nectria on sassafras and\r\n    yellow-poplar.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nOlder Nectria cankers are easily recognized in forest stands because of\r\ntheir typical “target” shape. “Target” cankers have rings, each of which\r\nrepresent a year’s growth. Younger cankers tend to be grown over by bark\r\nand callus tissue attempting to heal the wound. Such cankers are\r\ndifficult to recognize, but close examination of the affected area may\r\nreveal tiny red bodies, which are the fruiting bodies of the Nectria\r\nfungi. Mortality rarely occurs from this disease, but stems may break at\r\ncanker locations during high winds.\r\n\r\nControl of Nectria canker is the same as for Strumella canker—the\r\nremoval of infected trees during thinning operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            STRUMELLA CANKER\r\n\r\nStrumella canker of hardwoods, caused by _Strumella coryneoidia_, most\r\nfrequently attacks trees of the red oak group. Other hosts include\r\nspecies in the white oak group. Beech, basswood, blackgum, shagbark\r\nhickory and red maple are also occasionally affected. This disease is\r\nfound in the East, from the southern Appalachians to northern New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Strumella canker on black oak.]\r\n\r\nStrumella cankers are of two types: diffuse, and the more common\r\n“target-shaped.” The first develops on smooth-barked saplings and\r\nrapidly girdles and kills the tree. Killing results because callus\r\ntissue, which tends to heal over cankers, does not have time to develop.\r\nTarget-shaped cankers are more common. “Targets” are formed by the\r\nalternation of killing of bark by the fungus around the canker’s\r\nperimeter and the formation, in turn, of a callus ridge by the host\r\ntree. The fungus is active usually in the dormant season, while\r\ncallusing occurs in the spring. As with most canker-causing fungi,\r\nStrumella usually enters the tree through a branch stub. Cankers are\r\nquite large and may reach several feet in circumference or length. The\r\npresence of the causal fungus is revealed by dark brown, cushion-like\r\nstructures about one to three millimeters in diameter on the dead bark\r\nand surrounding tissue.\r\n\r\nNo feasible control method is available under forest conditions.\r\nHowever, the disease impact can be greatly reduced by removing cankered\r\ntrees during thinning operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SPICULOSA CANKER\r\n\r\nSpiculosa canker, caused by _Poria spiculosa_, is found on bottomland\r\noaks in the South. Occasionally this disease will also degrade hickories\r\nand honeylocust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of Poria rot and canker on oak.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross section of tree showing rot and decay.]\r\n\r\nSpiculosa canker is considered to be a canker-rot disease, a type of\r\ndecay in which the causal organism incites not only heart-rot but also\r\nlarge irregular cankers. Infected trees have cankers that appear as\r\nrough circular swellings on the bole. The canker centers are depressed\r\nand old branch stubs are discernible. Fungus fruiting bodies, or conks,\r\nusually are not present on living trees but develop on snags or decayed\r\nlogs. The conks grow flat under the bark and push it off to expose the\r\nbrown fungus fruiting surface.\r\n\r\nControl for Spiculosa canker is similar to other canker rots: salvage to\r\nremove undesirable cankered trees that may be later replaced by better\r\nquality trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IRPEX CANKER\r\n\r\nIrpex canker, caused by _Irpex mollis_, is prevalent in bottomlands and\r\non upland areas of the Southeast. In the bottoms, Nuttall, water, and\r\nwillow oaks are affected. White, chestnut, southern red, and black oaks\r\nare the hosts of this disease on upland sites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of Irpex rot.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross section of tree showing rot and decay.]\r\n\r\nIrpex canker is also considered to be a canker-rot disease. Symptoms on\r\ninfected trees frequently involve irregular cankers up to two feet in\r\nlength. Cankers are usually found on trees eight to ten inches in\r\ndiameter or larger, at a height of twenty feet above the ground. Branch\r\nstubs, signifying probable infection points, are usually present in the\r\ncenters of cankers. The portion of the trunk affected is usually swollen\r\nbut sometimes may be sunken. At the base of the sunken portion of the\r\ncanker are small, creamy-white, toothed fruiting bodies or conks with a\r\nleathery texture. Conks also appear on hardwood logs. The wood behind\r\ncankers is characterized by a tough, spongy, white rot which extends as\r\nmuch as eight feet above and below the canker. The decay pattern may\r\nalso extend downward into the roots. In cross-section, the rotted areas\r\nappear as finger-like projections radiating out toward the sapwood.\r\nGradually the rot column tapers to a thin central core beyond which\r\nwhite flecks appear, and this early rot stage is concentrated along the\r\nrays of the oaks.\r\n\r\nControl for Irpex canker is the same as for other canker-rots—salvage of\r\nundesirable cankered trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HISPIDUS CANKER\r\n\r\n_Polyporus hispidus_ is the cause of trunk cankers and localized decay\r\nof hardwoods throughout eastern, central, and southern United States.\r\nThe fungus is also known to attack hardwoods in Oregon and California.\r\nReported hosts are: hickory, ash, mulberry, willow, walnut, and oak. In\r\nthe south, _P. hispidus_ is common on oaks, including willow, water,\r\nblack, white, Nuttall, and cherrybark.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body and canker of Hispidus on oak.]\r\n\r\nThe fungus usually enters the tree through dead branch stubs, from which\r\nit grows into the heartwood. After becoming established, the fungus\r\nbegins penetrating the sapwood and attacks the living cambium. Callus\r\nfolds are formed by the host around the dead cambial area, forming an\r\nelongated swollen canker, commonly referred to as a “hispidus canker”.\r\nThe cankered area of the stem is bark-covered and sunken, usually\r\ncontaining a remnant of a branch stub or branch scar. During late\r\nsummer, fall or early winter, the fungus produces conks (sporophores) on\r\nthe surface of the cankers. The annual bracket-shaped conks are large,\r\nspongy, and yellowish-brown to rusty-brown on the upper surface. When\r\nfresh, the under surface is a light tan color. After a few months, the\r\nmature conks dry to a rigid black mass and fall from the canker. Old\r\nconks are commonly found at the base of cankered trees during the spring\r\nand early summer. Decay produced by the fungus appears spongy, light\r\nyellow, and is commonly separated from the sound wood by a black zone\r\nline. The rot is of the delignifying white rot type. On southern oaks,\r\nthe rate of canker elongation has been estimated at one-half foot per\r\nyear, with the internal rot usually extending about one foot above and\r\nbelow the cankered area.\r\n\r\nNo effective control in forest stands is known. Removal of diseased\r\ntrees provides additional growing space for crop trees. Some degree of\r\nshade tree protection can be obtained by pruning of dead branches flush\r\nwith the main stem of the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BOTRYOSPHAERIA CANKER\r\n\r\n_Botryosphaeria ribis_ causes cankering and mortality of more than 50\r\nwoody plants. The fungus is widely distributed throughout the eastern\r\none-half of the United States. The pathogen infects the following\r\neconomically important hosts: sweetgum, redbud, willow, poplar, tupelo,\r\npecan, and hickory.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Botryosphaeria canker on sweetgum.]\r\n\r\nThe fungus gains entry into susceptible hosts primarily through wounds\r\nor dead and dying twigs. Small oval cankers on stems or branches are the\r\nfirst symptoms of infection. As the fungus continues to attack and kill\r\nthe cambium, the sunken cankers enlarge, eventually girdling and killing\r\nthe branch or stem above the cankered area. In the spring and early\r\nsummer, cankers on living portions of the host often produce an exudate.\r\nInfected sweetgums generally produce the exudate in great quantities, to\r\nwhich the common name of bleeding necrosis has been applied.\r\nReproductive structures called stroma are produced by the fungus on dead\r\ncankered stems and branches during moist periods of the spring and\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nNo practical method of control is known. Diseased trees seldom recover.\r\nInfection of high value shade and ornamental trees may be prevented to\r\nsome degree by avoiding mechanical damage. Dead limbs and branches\r\nshould be pruned and wounds covered with a suitable tree paint. Infected\r\ntrees should be removed and burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SEPTORIA CANKER\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Septoria canker on young cottonwood saplings.]\r\n\r\nSeptoria canker is caused by the fungus _Septoria musiva_. Although this\r\nis a disease of poplars, native poplar species are not severely\r\nattacked. However, this is an important problem wherever hybrid or\r\nintroduced poplars are grown. With the ever-increasing emphasis on\r\npoplar planting, this will probably become a much more important problem\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\nYoung stem cankers usually develop around openings such as wounds,\r\nlenticels, or leaf scars, appearing first as sunken, dark areas of the\r\nbark. The infected area later becomes more depressed and darker as\r\ntissue dies, and often a black margin will be formed around the canker.\r\nSmall, pink, hair-like spore tendrils are produced by the fungus around\r\nthe canker margin, especially during moist weather. These tendrils\r\ncontain spores which can cause further infection, and arise from small\r\ndark fungal fruiting structures called pycnidia. This cankered area is\r\noften invaded by insects and other fungi and is also a weakened area at\r\nwhich wind breakage may occur. The fungus also causes a gray to black\r\nleaf spot, which usually has a light colored center. These spots may\r\ncoalesce on a severely infected leaf and involve the entire leaf\r\nsurface. This leaf spot in itself causes slight damage, but acts as a\r\nsource of fungus spores which can cause stem cankers, and thus is\r\nimportant in the overall consideration of the disease.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Defoliation in cottonwood caused by Septoria\r\n    leafspot.]\r\n\r\nA control for this disease is to use native poplars or resistant hybrids\r\nwherever possible. Wider spacing in plantations may also reduce the\r\nhumidity, decreasing the amount of infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CYTOSPORA CANKER\r\n\r\nCytospora canker is caused by _Cytospora chrysosperma_. This fungus\r\nattacks more than 70 species of hardwood trees and shrubs as well as\r\nsome conifers. Poplars and willows are among the most common hosts, and\r\nare attacked throughout their range. Trees used for shade or windbreak,\r\nand also cuttings in propagation beds are particularly susceptible to\r\nthis canker. This disease is most severe on trees growing under stress,\r\nsuch as those growing on an unfavorable site, or injured by drought,\r\nfrost, fire, or severe pruning. The fungus is a normal inhabitant of the\r\nbark and becomes parasitic only when the tree is weakened.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cytospora canker on cottonwood.]\r\n\r\nA canker begins as a gradual, circular killing of the bark of a limb or\r\nstem. This infected tissue soon appears as a brownish, sunken patch,\r\naround which the host often produces raised callus tissue. Small black\r\nfungal structures (pycnidia) appear as small pimples on the dead bark.\r\nDuring moist weather, thin threads of spores exude out from the\r\npycnidia. The inner diseased bark becomes dark and odorous. The cambium\r\nis killed and the sapwood becomes watery and reddish brown as it becomes\r\ninfected. Water spouts may form below the canker before the tree dies.\r\n\r\nSince this disease is most severe on weakened trees, shade trees should\r\nbe watered and fertilized to maintain healthy, vigorous growth. Wounding\r\nand severe pruning should be avoided. Cuttings should be selected from\r\nhealthy planting material grown in disease free areas. If cuttings are\r\nto be stored for any length of time, they should be kept at a\r\ntemperature below 35°. This low temperature will keep new infections\r\nfrom occurring, even if spores are present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHESTNUT BLIGHT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stem canker caused by chestnut blight organism.]\r\n\r\nChestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Endothia parasitica_. It can be\r\nfound on American chestnut throughout its range where it has virtually\r\neliminated this valuable species from eastern hardwood forests. The\r\nchestnut blight fungus is also parasitic on other hosts including common\r\nchinkapin, Spanish chestnut, and post oak. Japanese and Chinese\r\nchestnuts are resistant.\r\n\r\nStem cankers are either swollen or sunken and the sunken type may be\r\ngrown over with bark. The fungus forms fruiting bodies some distance\r\nback from the advancing cankers, and the spores may exude from bark\r\ncrevices as orange curl-like masses during moist weather. Young cankers\r\nare yellow-brown in sharp contrast to the normal olive-green color of\r\nthe bark. The chestnut is a vigorous sprouting species but the fungus\r\nsurvives in previously killed stumps and later kills the new sprout\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nNo effective control has been developed for chestnut blight, even after\r\nseveral decades of intensive research. The most promising control\r\ninvolves the development of a blight-resistant species. Research is\r\npresently underway on this matter but results are inconclusive.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting bodies on surface of canker.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                OAK WILT\r\n\r\nThis serious vascular wilt of oaks is caused by the fungus _Ceratocystis\r\nfagacearum_. At least fifty species and varieties of oak are\r\nsusceptible. The disease has been most damaging in the Lake States but\r\nis also found in the eastern United States.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Oak wilt symptoms on red oak trees and leaves.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (cont.)]\r\n\r\nOak wilt symptoms are most noticeable during late spring or early\r\nsummer. Red oaks may be killed in as little as three weeks, the lower\r\nbranches being affected last. In white oaks, symptoms are usually\r\nconfined to a few branches each year and trees may live several years\r\nbefore death. Leaf symptoms are similar for both red and white oaks.\r\nLeaves turn yellow or brown and become dry progressively from the edge\r\nor tip to the midrib and base. Mature leaves may fall at any symptom\r\nstage from green to brown. Premature leaf shedding is the most\r\noutstanding symptom. A definite characteristic of the disease is the\r\nraising and cracking of the bark due to pressure of mats of the fungus\r\ngrowing between the bark and wood.\r\n\r\nOak wilt is spread over long distances by insects that pick up spores\r\nwhile crawling on the mats of infected trees. The disease may also\r\nspread from tree to tree via root graft. Short-distance spread is\r\ncontrolled by severing all roots of living trees around infected trees\r\nby use of a ditchdigger. Another control is to fell all trees in a\r\n50-foot radius of infected trees; felling and burning of all parts of\r\ninfected trees is sometimes done to prevent overland spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DUTCH ELM DISEASE\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dying tree infected with Dutch elm disease.]\r\n\r\nDutch elm disease, caused by _Ceratocystis ulmi_, is the most\r\ndevastating disease of elm trees in the United States. This disease has\r\nbeen recorded in most states east of the Mississippi and as far as Idaho\r\nin the Northwest and Texas in the Southwest. All of the native elm\r\nspecies are susceptible, while many of the ornamental Asiatic species\r\nare highly resistant.\r\n\r\nTrees suffering from Dutch elm disease may show a variety of symptoms.\r\nLeaves become yellow, wilt, and turn brown. Premature defoliation and\r\ndeath of branches usually occurs, causing the crown to appear thin and\r\nsparse. Internally, a brown discoloration appears in the outer sapwood.\r\n_C. ulmi_ is transmitted from diseased to healthy elms by elm bark\r\nbeetles, mainly the small European elm bark beetle and the native elm\r\nbark beetle. These beetles make characteristic galleries under the bark\r\nof dead and dying elms. Adult beetles pick up the sticky fungus spores\r\nfrom under the bark and then feed on the young tender elm twigs of\r\nhealthy trees, inadvertently inoculating the healthy tree with the\r\nfungus. The fungus may also spread from diseased elms to adjacent\r\nhealthy elms through root grafts.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Discoloration and streaking symptoms in the sapwood.]\r\n\r\nControls to combat this disease generally involve sanitary measures\r\naimed at the beetles. Dead and dying elms should be burned. This\r\neliminates the elm wood which normally serves as a breeding place for\r\nelm bark beetles and thus reduces the beetle population. In areas where\r\nmost native elms are infected, other tree species or resistant elm\r\nspecies, such as the Chinese or Siberian elm, should be planted rather\r\nthem native elms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ELM PHLOEM NECROSIS\r\n\r\nElm phloem necrosis is a disease of elm, caused by a virus or virus-like\r\norganism. The disease has occurred in the United States for many years,\r\nprobably as early as 1882. The pathogen is transmitted from infected to\r\nhealthy trees by the adult white-banded elm leafhopper, _Scaphoideus\r\nluteolus_, which feeds on the leaf veins. It is now present throughout\r\nmost of the central, eastern, and southern portions of the United\r\nStates. The disease is known to occur on American and winged elm, but\r\nall native elms are probably susceptible to attack by the pathogen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Foliage symptoms of elm phloem necrosis.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest symptoms of the disease appear in the top of the crown, at\r\nthe outer tips of the branches. Here the elm leaves suddenly wilt, turn\r\nyellow, the margins curl upward and the leaves die. Leaf-fall causes the\r\ncrown to appear sparse. In large trees, the foliage symptoms may\r\ninitially appear on one branch or only a portion of the crown. However,\r\nthe symptoms during the advanced stage of the disease are exhibited\r\nthroughout the crown. The most reliable symptom appears as a yellow to\r\nbutterscotch discoloration on the inner bark surface or phloem. This\r\nsymptom initially appears under the bark of large roots, later spreading\r\nto the base of the main stem and finally to the larger branches. Phloem\r\nand cambial discoloration is often found in advance of the foliage\r\nsymptoms. The moderately discolored phlomen has a slight odor of\r\nwintergreen. Thus far, all trees known to be infected with the pathogen\r\nhave died. Acutely infected trees, while initially appearing healthy,\r\nmay wilt and die in three to four weeks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stem sample showing discoloration of sapwood.]\r\n\r\nNo effective controls are known. The “Christine Buisman” elm, which is\r\nhighly resistant to Dutch elm disease, has demonstrated resistance to\r\nelm phloem necrosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MIMOSA WILT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Mimosa branches showing wilt symptoms.]\r\n\r\nA vascular wilt of the mimosa (silktree) is caused by the fungus\r\n_Fusarium oxysporum forma perniciosum_. The fungus is known only to\r\nattack the mimosa, a tree imported from eastern Asia and grown\r\nthroughout the southeast as an ornamental. Since the discovery of the\r\ndisease in North Carolina in 1935, the fungus has spread north to\r\nMaryland, south to Florida, and west to Texas.\r\n\r\nThe fungus causing mimosa wilt is soil-borne and gains entrance into the\r\ntree by attacking the roots. Once entrance is gained by the fungus, the\r\npathogen enters the outer water-conductive system in the sapwood. As the\r\nfungus grows throughout the system, it hinders or completely inhibits\r\nthe water movement from the roots to the aerial portion of the tree. The\r\nfirst outward symptom of disease is the wilting of leaflets, usually in\r\nthe upper portion of the crown. The wilted leaflets turn yellow, then\r\nbrown, and die. Often a branch or two will succumb at a time until the\r\nentire crown is dead. A second symptom of the disease is found in the\r\nouter sapwood of the tree. A brown discoloration, appearing as spots or\r\na ring, is observed by cutting into the outer sapwood of the infected\r\nstem or branch.\r\n\r\nControl of the fungus is very difficult, since it is soil-borne and\r\nenters through the roots. However, resistant varieties of mimosa trees,\r\ndeveloped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are now available at\r\nmost commercial nurseries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Branch sample showing brown discoloration of\r\n    sapwood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VERTICILLIUM WILT\r\n\r\nVerticillium wilt, caused by common soil-inhabiting fungi belonging to\r\nthe genus _Verticillium_, is found on a number of hardwood hosts. In\r\nsouthern and eastern United States elms and maples are attacked\r\nthroughout their natural ranges.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Wilting foliage and defoliation of elms caused by\r\n    Verticillium wilt.]\r\n\r\nInfected trees may die within a few weeks after the first symptoms are\r\nobserved, or they may survive for years. The first symptoms of the\r\ndisease involve a wilting of the foliage, with the leaves turning yellow\r\nand finally brown. The early symptoms are often restricted to a single\r\nlimb or portion of the crown. Vascular discoloration, which is brown in\r\nelms and green in maples, is present in the outer sapwood. In elms, this\r\ndiscoloration is similar to that produced in trees having Dutch elm\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThis disease is not of serious consequence in forest stands. However, it\r\nis often extremely important in high value shade trees. Dead or dying\r\nlimbs on lawn trees may be pruned out. This may not always save the\r\ntree, but may help keep it alive for years. Trees should be well watered\r\nand fertilized as necessary. If a lawn tree dies from Verticillium wilt,\r\nit should be replaced by a resistant species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ARMILLARIA ROOT AND BUTT ROT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Mushroom or fruiting bodies of the “honey mushroom”\r\n    rot.]\r\n\r\nArmillaria root and butt rot is caused by the fungus _Armillaria\r\nmellea_. This disease is common in orchards, vineyards, gardens, parks,\r\nand forests throughout the world. Both coniferous and hardwood forest\r\ntrees are attacked. The fungus is especially troublesome in plantations,\r\nparticularly in stands recently thinned.\r\n\r\nThe fungus is spread by spores produced by honey-colored mushrooms,\r\nrhizomorphs, and root contacts between diseased trees or stumps and\r\nhealthy trees. Rhizomorphs are visible strands of compacted mycelium\r\n(fungus material) that appear as black or reddish-brown “shoestrings.”\r\nThey may be flattened when found between bark and wood or cylindrical\r\nwhen found in decayed wood or soil. Rhizomorphs increase in length at\r\ntheir tips and in this manner the fungus may move through the soil from\r\ninfected trees to uninfected trees. The honey-colored mushrooms are\r\nproduced annually and are fairly short lived; they are subject to\r\ndesiccation, and are favored by small mammals. The size of the top\r\nvaries from two to five inches in diameter. The top is usually flecked\r\nwith dark brown scales. White to light yellow gills are borne\r\nunderneath. Crown symptoms of the trees affected are similar to those\r\ncaused by any malfunctioning of the roots. A reduction in size and\r\nproduction of leaves or needles, a general thinning of the crown, branch\r\ndying, and yellowing of foliage may precede death or trees may die\r\nrapidly with a rapid red discoloration of the foliage. Trees often die\r\nin groups, but single-tree kill is also common. Cankers bleeding resin,\r\ngum or other exudate at the tree base are common symptoms.\r\n\r\nControl is not attempted for this disease under forest conditions.\r\nLosses may be reduced by following proper planting procedures, and by\r\nsalvage cutting.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Shoestrings of armillaria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CYLINDROCLADIUM ROOT ROT\r\n\r\nThis nursery disease is caused by two fungi species. _Cylindrocladium\r\nscoparium_ and _C. floridanum_: Cylindrocladium root rot has been found\r\non two hardwoods (yellow-poplar and black walnut) and two conifers\r\n(white pine and Fraser fir) in forest tree nurseries in six southern\r\nstates. These include Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Leaf symptoms on 1-0 black walnut nursery stock.]\r\n\r\nRoot rot symptoms on hardwoods and conifers are quite different. The\r\nmost characteristic root symptoms on yellow-poplar and black walnut are\r\nthe blackened and longitudinally-cracked infected roots that are in\r\nsharp contrast with healthy white roots of these two species. Infected\r\nseedling leaves become yellow and later turn reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nRoot rot symptoms on conifers involve either rotting of the seed or\r\nseedling (pre-emergence damping off) before emergence from the soil or\r\nseedling root rot following emergence. These symptoms also involve a\r\nshrivelling and reddening of foliage, needle blight, and stem cankers.\r\nThe most characteristic symptoms are the “patchy” irregularly scattered\r\npattern of infection in conifer seedling beds and the loosening of the\r\nroot epidermis on infected roots—making it very easy to pull off.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Root symptoms on 1-0 yellow-poplar nursery stock.]\r\n\r\nThe most practical and effective control for root rot diseases of this\r\ntype involves strict quarantine to either keep the disease out of the\r\nnursery or keep it confined to known infected areas by avoiding the\r\ntransportation of root material, organic matter, and soil from infected\r\nto non-infected seed beds. Soil fumigation may control this disease if\r\napplied under favorable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LUCIDUS ROOT AND BUTT ROT\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fruiting body of Lucidus root and butt rot on\r\n    mimosa.]\r\n\r\n_Polyporus lucidus_ is the cause of root and basal stem decay of\r\nhardwood trees throughout the eastern, central, and southern portions of\r\nthe United States. The fungus is known to attack and kill maple,\r\nhackberry, orange, lemon, ash, sweetgum, oak, locust, elm, tupelo,\r\nwillow, and mimosa. Mimosa trees are very susceptible to attack by _P.\r\nlucidus_ throughout the South.\r\n\r\nThe disease is characterized by a rapid decline and death of the host.\r\nExamination of infected roots will reveal a soft spongy white rot with\r\nblack spots scattered throughout. Fruiting bodies are formed at the base\r\nof infected trees or on the surface of exposed roots. The mature\r\nfruiting bodies are a reddish brown above and white below, with the tops\r\nand stems appearing glazed or varnished. The fungus is believed to gain\r\nentrance into the host through bark and root injuries and can spread\r\nfrom infected to healthy trees through root contacts and grafts.\r\n\r\nNo control is known for this disease. Avoidance of lawnmower and other\r\nmechanical injuries to the base of roots of susceptible shade trees will\r\nreduce the chance of infection by the fungus. The spread of the disease\r\nfrom infected to healthy trees can be reduced by planting at a wide\r\nenough spacing to avoid root contacts and grafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_If you find damage on your trees from insects or diseases you may\r\nconsult with any of the following offices or your state forester._\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIELD OFFICES:\r\n  _Alexandria Office_\r\n    U.S. Forest Service\r\n    2500 Shreveport Highway\r\n    Pineville, Louisiana 71360\r\n    Phone A/C 318 445-6511 Ext. 311\r\n  FOR STATES OF:\r\n    Alabama\r\n    Arkansas\r\n    Louisiana\r\n    Mississippi\r\n    Oklahoma\r\n    Texas\r\n  _Asheville Office_\r\n    U.S. Forest Service\r\n    P.O.
