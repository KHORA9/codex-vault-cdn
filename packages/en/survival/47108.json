Deserts—stark, sometimes mysterious\r\nworlds—have been portrayed as fascinating environments of adventure and\r\nexploration from narratives such as that of Lawrence of Arabia to movies\r\nsuch as “Dune.” These arid regions are called _deserts_ because they are\r\ndry. They may be hot, they may be cold. They may be regions of sand or\r\nvast areas of rocks and gravel peppered with occasional plants. But\r\ndeserts are always dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ripples on a dune in the Gran Desierto, Mexico\r\n(photograph by Peter Kresan).]\r\n\r\nDeserts are natural laboratories in which to study the interactions of\r\nwind and sometimes water on the arid surfaces of planets. They contain\r\nvaluable mineral deposits that were formed in the arid environment or\r\nthat were exposed by erosion. Because deserts are dry, they are ideal\r\nplaces for human artifacts and fossils to be preserved. Deserts are also\r\nfragile environments. The misuse of these lands is a serious and growing\r\nproblem in parts of our world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF NON-POLAR ARID LAND (after Meigs, 1953)]\r\n\r\n                         [Higher-resolution map]\r\n\r\nThere are almost as many definitions of deserts and classification\r\nsystems as there are deserts in the world. Most classifications rely on\r\nsome combination of the number of days of rainfall, the total amount of\r\nannual rainfall, temperature, humidity, or other factors. In 1953,\r\nPeveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth into three categories\r\naccording to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now\r\nwidely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least 12\r\nconsecutive months without rainfall, arid lands have less than 250\r\nmillimeters of annual rainfall, and semiarid lands have a mean annual\r\nprecipitation of between 250 and 500 millimeters. Arid and extremely\r\narid land are deserts, and semiarid grasslands generally are referred to\r\nas steppes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gran Desierto of the Sonoran Desert, Mexico. Surrounding\r\nthe dark 25-kilometer-long and 5-kilometer-wide Sierra del Rosario\r\nmountains (upper right) are dunes and sheets of sand.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 How the Atmosphere Influences Aridity\r\n\r\n\r\nWe live at the bottom of a gaseous envelope—the atmosphere—that is bound\r\ngravitationally to the planet Earth. The circulation of our atmosphere\r\nis a complex process because of the Earth’s rotation and the tilt of its\r\naxis. The Earth’s axis is inclined 23½° from the ecliptic, the plane of\r\nthe Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Due to this inclination, vertical rays\r\nof the Sun strike 23½° N. latitude, the Tropic of Cancer, at summer\r\nsolstice in late June. At winter solstice, the vertical rays strike 23½°\r\nS. latitude, the Tropic of Capricorn. In the Northern Hemisphere, the\r\nsummer solstice day has the most daylight hours, and the winter solstice\r\nhas the fewest daylight hours each year. The tilt of the axis allows\r\ndifferential heating of the Earth’s surface, which causes seasonal\r\nchanges in the global circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The circulation pattern of the Earth’s atmosphere. Most\r\nof the nonpolar deserts lie within the two trade winds belts.]\r\n\r\nOn a planetary scale, the circulation of air between the hot Equator and\r\nthe cold North and South Poles creates pressure belts that influence\r\nweather. Air warmed by the Sun rises at the Equator, cools as it moves\r\ntoward the poles, descends as cold air over the poles, and warms again\r\nas it moves over the surface of the Earth toward the Equator. This\r\nsimple pattern of atmospheric convection, however, is complicated by the\r\nrotation of the Earth, which introduces the Coriolis Effect.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the origin of this effect, consider the following. A stick\r\nplaced vertically in the ground at the North Pole would simply turn\r\naround as the Earth rotates. A stick at the Equator would move in a\r\nlarge circle of almost 40,000 kilometers with the Earth as it rotates.\r\n\r\nThe Coriolis Effect illustrates Newton’s first law of motion—a body in\r\nmotion will maintain its speed and direction of motion unless acted on\r\nby some outside force. Thus, a wind travelling north from the equator\r\nwill maintain the velocity acquired at the equator while the Earth under\r\nit is moving slower. This effect accounts for the generally east-west\r\ndirection of winds, or streams of air, on the Earth’s surface. Winds\r\nblow between areas of different atmospheric pressures.\r\n\r\nThe Coriolis Effect influences the circulation pattern of the Earth’s\r\natmosphere. In the zone between about 30° N. and 30° S., the surface air\r\nflows toward the Equator and the flow aloft is poleward. A low-pressure\r\narea of calm, light variable winds near the equator is known to mariners\r\nas the _doldrums_.\r\n\r\nAround 30° N. and S., the poleward flowing air begins to descend toward\r\nthe surface in subtropical high-pressure belts. The sinking air is\r\nrelatively dry because its moisture has already been released near the\r\nEquator above the tropical rain forests. Near the center of this\r\nhigh-pressure zone of descending air, called the “Horse Latitudes,” the\r\nwinds at the surface are weak and variable. The name for this area is\r\nbelieved to have been given by colonial sailors, who, becalmed sometimes\r\nat these latitudes while crossing the oceans with horses as cargo, were\r\nforced to throw a few horses overboard to conserve water.\r\n\r\nThe surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts\r\ntoward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by\r\nthe Coriolis Effect. Because winds are named for the direction from\r\nwhich the wind is blowing, these winds are called the northeast trade\r\nwinds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeast trade winds in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere. The trade winds meet at the doldrums. Surface winds\r\nknown as “westerlies” flow from the Horse Latitudes toward the poles.\r\nThe “westerlies” meet “easterlies” from the polar highs at about 50-60°\r\nN. and S.\r\n\r\nNear the ground, wind direction is affected by friction and by changes\r\nin topography. Winds may be seasonal, sporadic, or daily. They range\r\nfrom gentle breezes to violent gusts at speeds greater than 300\r\nkilometers/hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These dunes in the Algodones Sand Sea of southeastern\r\nCalifornia move as much as 5 meters per year. The dunes in this\r\nphotograph, looking south, move toward the east (left) (photograph by\r\nPeter Kresan).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Searles Lake, California (photograph courtesy of\r\nKerr-McGee, Inc.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Where Deserts Form\r\n\r\n\r\nDry areas created by global circulation patterns contain most of the\r\ndeserts on the Earth. The deserts of our world are not restricted by\r\nlatitude, longitude, or elevation. They occur from areas close to the\r\npoles down to areas near the Equator. The People’s Republic of China has\r\nboth the highest desert, the Qaidam Depression that is 2,600 meters\r\nabove sea level, and one of the lowest deserts, the Turpan Depression\r\nthat is 150 meters below sea level.\r\n\r\nDeserts are not confined to Earth. The atmospheric circulation patterns\r\nof other terrestrial planets with gaseous envelopes also depend on the\r\nrotation of those planets, the tilts of their axes, their distances from\r\nthe Sun, and the composition and density of their atmospheres. Except\r\nfor the poles, the entire surface of Mars is a desert. Venus also may\r\nsupport deserts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Garlock fault, near the bottom of this Landsat image,\r\nis generally considered to be the geologic border between the Mojave\r\nDesert in the south and the Great Basin Desert in the north. The Great\r\nBasin contains more than 150 discrete desert basins separated by more\r\nthan 160 mountain ranges.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Types of Deserts\r\n\r\n\r\nDeserts are classified by their geographical location and dominant\r\nweather pattern as _trade wind_, _midlatitude_, _rain shadow_,\r\n_coastal_, _monsoon_, or _polar_ deserts. Former desert areas presently\r\nin nonarid environments are _paleodeserts_, and _extraterrestrial_\r\ndeserts exist on other planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Trade wind deserts\r\n\r\nThe trade winds in two belts on the equatorial sides of the Horse\r\nLatitudes heat up as they move toward the Equator. These dry winds\r\ndissipate cloud cover, allowing more sunlight to heat the land. Most of\r\nthe major deserts of the world lie in areas crossed by the trade winds.\r\nThe world’s largest desert, the Sahara of North Africa, which has\r\nexperienced temperatures as high as 57° C, is a trade wind desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Midlatitude deserts\r\n\r\nMidlatitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° N. and S., poleward of the\r\nsubtropical high-pressure zones. These deserts are in interior drainage\r\nbasins far from oceans and have a wide range of annual temperatures. The\r\nSonoran Desert of southwestern North America is a typical midlatitude\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Rain shadow deserts\r\n\r\nRain shadow deserts are formed because tall mountain ranges prevent\r\nmoisture-rich clouds from reaching areas on the lee, or protected side,\r\nof the range. As air rises over the mountain, water is precipitated and\r\nthe air loses its moisture content. A desert is formed in the leeside\r\n“shadow” of the range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sahara of Africa is the world’s largest desert. It\r\ncontains complex linear dunes that are separated by almost 6 kilometers\r\n(Skylab photograph).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rare rain in the Tengger, a midlatitude desert of\r\nChina, exposes ripples and a small blowout on the left. Winds will\r\nshortly cover or remove these features.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This Landsat image shows the Turpan Depression in the\r\nrain shadow desert of the Tian Shan of China. A sand sea is in the lower\r\ncenter on the right, but desert pavement, gray in color, dominates this\r\ndesert. The few oases in the desert and the vegetation in the mountains\r\nat the top are in red. A blanket of snow separates the vegetation in the\r\nTian Shan from the rain shadow desert.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Coastal deserts\r\n\r\nCoastal deserts generally are found on the western edges of continents\r\nnear the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They are affected by cold\r\nocean currents that parallel the coast. Because local wind systems\r\ndominate the trade winds, these deserts are less stable than other\r\ndeserts. Winter fogs, produced by upwelling cold currents, frequently\r\nblanket coastal deserts and block solar radiation. Coastal deserts are\r\nrelatively complex because they are at the juncture of terrestrial,\r\noceanic, and atmospheric systems. A coastal desert, the Atacama of South\r\nAmerica, is the Earth’s driest desert. In the Atacama, measurable\r\nrainfall—1 millimeter or more of rain—may occur as infrequently as once\r\nevery 5-20 years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crescent-shaped dunes are common in coastal deserts such\r\nas the Namib, Africa, with prevailing onshore winds. Low clouds cover\r\nparts of the Namib in this space shuttle photo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: High dunes of the Namib Desert near Sossus Vlei\r\n(photograph by Georg Gerster).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Morning fog moistens the dunes of the Namib coastal\r\ndesert (photograph by Georg Gerster).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Monsoon deserts\r\n\r\n“Monsoon,” derived from an Arabic word for “season,” refers to a wind\r\nsystem with pronounced seasonal reversal. Monsoons develop in response\r\nto temperature variations between continents and oceans. The southeast\r\ntrade winds of the Indian Ocean, for example, provide heavy summer rains\r\nin India as they move onshore. As the monsoon crosses India, it loses\r\nmoisture on the eastern slopes of the Aravalli Range. The Rajasthan\r\nDesert of India and the Thar Desert of Pakistan are parts of a monsoon\r\ndesert region west of the range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Indus River floodplain, lower left, is the western\r\nborder of the Thar Desert. This Landsat image of the monsoon desert\r\nshows small patches of sand sheets in the upper right, with three types\r\nof dunes; some dunes are almost 3 kilometers long.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Polar deserts\r\n\r\nPolar deserts are areas with annual precipitation less than 250\r\nmillimeters and a mean temperature during the warmest month of less than\r\n10° C. Polar deserts on the Earth cover nearly 5 million square\r\nkilometers and are mostly bedrock or gravel plains. Sand dunes are not\r\nprominent features in these deserts, but snow dunes occur commonly in\r\nareas where precipitation is locally more abundant.\r\n\r\nTemperature changes in polar deserts frequently cross the freezing point\r\nof water. This “freeze-thaw” alternation forms patterned textures on the\r\nground, as much as 5 meters in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dry Valleys of Antarctica have been ice-free for\r\nthousands of years (courtesy of USGS Image Processing Facility,\r\nFlagstaff, Arizona).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Paleodeserts\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This aerial photograph of the Nebraska Sand Hills\r\npaleodesert shows a well-preserved crescent-shaped dune (or barchan)\r\nabout 60 to 75 meters high (photograph by Thomas S. Ahlbrandt).]\r\n\r\nData on ancient sand seas (vast regions of sand dunes), changing lake\r\nbasins, archaeology, and vegetation analyses indicate that climatic\r\nconditions have changed considerably over vast areas of the Earth in the\r\nrecent geologic past. During the last 12,500 years, for example, parts\r\nof the deserts were more arid than they are today. About 10 percent of\r\nthe land between 30° N. and 30° S. is covered now by sand seas. Nearly\r\n18,000 years ago, sand seas in two vast belts occupied almost 50 percent\r\nof this land area. As is the case today, tropical rain forests and\r\nsavannahs were between the two belts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A dry community of vegetation grows among the dunes of\r\nthe Nebraska Sand Hills (photograph by N. H. Darton).]\r\n\r\nFossil desert sediments that are as much as 500 million years old have\r\nbeen found in many parts of the world. Sand dune-like patterns have been\r\nrecognized in presently nonarid environments. Many such relict dunes now\r\nreceive from 80 to 150 millimeters of rain each year. Some ancient dunes\r\nare in areas now occupied by tropical rain forests.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Sand Hills is an inactive 57,000-square kilometer dune\r\nfield in central Nebraska. The largest sand sea in the Western\r\nHemisphere, it is now stabilized by vegetation and receives about 500\r\nmillimeters of rain each year. Dunes in the Sand Hills are up to 120\r\nmeters high.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Extraterrestrial deserts\r\n\r\nMars is the only other planet on which we have identified wind-shaped\r\n(_eolian_) features. Although its surface atmospheric pressure is only\r\nabout one-hundredth that of Earth, global circulation patterns on Mars\r\nhave formed a circumpolar sand sea of more than five million square\r\nkilometers, an area greater than the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia, the\r\nlargest sand sea on our planet. Martian sand seas consist predominantly\r\nof crescent-shaped dunes on plains near the perennial ice cap of the\r\nnorth polar area. Smaller dune fields occupy the floors of many large\r\ncraters in the polar regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This Viking spacecraft image of Mars shows alternating\r\nlayers of ice and windblown dust near the north polar cap. Annual and\r\nother periodic climatic changes due to orbit fluctuations may occur on\r\nMars (courtesy of USGS Image Processing Facility, Flagstaff, Arizona).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the first images taken at the Viking 2 landing\r\nsite on Mars shows the pink sky over Utopia and the desert pavement on\r\nthe ground (courtesy of NASA).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some of the crescent-shaped dunes in this Viking image of\r\nMars are more than a kilometer wide. The dark material that streaks from\r\nthe horn-shaped features may be dust recently blown from the dunes\r\n(courtesy of NASA).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natural Bridge, Arches National Monument, Utah\r\n(photograph by Peter Kresan).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Desert Features\r\n\r\n\r\nSand covers only about 20 percent of the Earth’s deserts. Most of the\r\nsand is in sand sheets and sand seas—vast regions of undulating dunes\r\nresembling ocean waves “frozen” in an instant of time.\r\n\r\nNearly 50 percent of desert surfaces are plains where eolian\r\ndeflation—removal of fine-grained material by the wind—has exposed loose\r\ngravels consisting predominantly of pebbles but with occasional cobbles.\r\n\r\nThe remaining surfaces of arid lands are composed of exposed bedrock\r\noutcrops, desert soils, and fluvial deposits including alluvial fans,\r\nplayas, desert lakes, and oases. Bedrock outcrops commonly occur as\r\nsmall mountains surrounded by extensive erosional plains.\r\n\r\nOases are vegetated areas moistened by springs, wells, or by irrigation.\r\nMany are artificial. Oases are often the only places in deserts that\r\nsupport crops and permanent habitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Underground channels carry water from nearby mountains\r\ninto the Turpan Depression of China. If the channels were not covered,\r\nthe water would evaporate quickly when it reached the hot, dry desert\r\nland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Soils\r\n\r\nSoils that form in arid climates are predominantly mineral soils with\r\nlow organic content. The repeated accumulation of water in some soils\r\ncauses distinct salt layers to form. Calcium carbonate precipitated from\r\nsolution may cement sand and gravel into hard layers called “calcrete”\r\nthat form layers up to 50 meters thick.\r\n\r\nCaliche is a reddish-brown to white layer found in many desert soils.\r\nCaliche commonly occurs as nodules or as coatings on mineral grains\r\nformed by the complicated interaction between water and carbon dioxide\r\nreleased by plant roots or by decaying organic material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Plants\r\n\r\nMost desert plants are drought- or salt-tolerant. Some store water in\r\ntheir leaves, roots, and stems. Other desert plants have long tap roots\r\nthat penetrate the water table, anchor the soil, and control erosion.\r\nThe stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of\r\nsand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sparse, very dry, single species vegetation in Death\r\nValley, California.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vegetation amidst the desert pavement of the Sonoran\r\nDesert (photograph by John Olsen).]\r\n\r\nDeserts typically have a plant cover that is sparse but enormously\r\ndiverse. The Sonoran Desert of the American Southwest has the most\r\ncomplex desert vegetation on Earth. The giant saguaro cacti provide\r\nnests for desert birds and serve as “trees” of the desert. Saguaro grow\r\nslowly but may live 200 years. When 9 years old, they are about 15\r\ncentimeters high. After about 75 years, the cacti are tall and develop\r\ntheir first branches. When fully grown, saguaro are 15 meters tall and\r\nweigh as much as 10 tons. They dot the Sonoran and reinforce the general\r\nimpression of deserts as cacti-rich land.\r\n\r\nAlthough cacti are often thought of as characteristic desert plants,\r\nother types of plants have adapted well to the arid environment. They\r\ninclude the pea family and sunflower family. Cold deserts have grasses\r\nand shrubs as dominant vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Water\r\n\r\nRain does fall occasionally in deserts, and desert storms are often\r\nviolent. A record 44 millimeters of rain once fell within 3 hours in the\r\nSahara. Large Saharan storms may deliver up to 1 millimeter per minute.\r\nNormally dry stream channels, called arroyos or wadis, can quickly fill\r\nafter heavy rains, and flash floods make these channels dangerous. More\r\npeople drown in deserts than die of thirst.\r\n\r\nThough little rain falls in deserts, deserts receive runoff from\r\nephemeral, or short-lived, streams fed by rain and snow from adjacent\r\nhighlands. These streams fill the channel with a slurry of mud and\r\ncommonly transport considerable quantities of sediment for a day or two.\r\nAlthough most deserts are in basins with closed, or interior drainage, a\r\nfew deserts are crossed by ‘exotic’ rivers that derive their water from\r\noutside the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and evaporate large\r\namounts of water on their journeys through the deserts, but their\r\nvolumes are such that they maintain their continuity. The Nile, the\r\nColorado, and the Yellow are exotic rivers that flow through deserts to\r\ndeliver their sediments to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Wei River in the Loess Plateau, China (photograph by\r\nI-Ming Chou).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Running water created this canyon in arid Big Bend\r\nNational Park, southwest Texas.]\r\n\r\nLakes form where rainfall or meltwater in interior drainage basins is\r\nsufficient. Desert lakes are generally shallow, temporary, and salty.\r\nBecause these lakes are shallow and have a low bottom gradient, wind\r\nstress may cause the lake waters to move over many square kilometers.\r\nWhen small lakes dry up, they leave a salt crust or hardpan. The flat\r\narea of clay, silt, or sand encrusted with salt that forms is known as a\r\n_playa_. There are more than a hundred playas in North American deserts.\r\nMost are relics of large lakes that existed during the last Ice Age\r\nabout 12,000 years ago. Lake Bonneville was a 52,000-square-kilometer\r\nlake almost 300 meters deep in Utah, Nevada, and Idaho during the Ice\r\nAge. Today the remnants of Lake Bonneville include Utah’s Great Salt\r\nLake, Utah Lake, and Sevier Lake. Because playas are arid land forms\r\nfrom a wetter past, they contain useful clues to climatic change.\r\n\r\nThe flat terrains of hardpans and playas make them excellent race tracks\r\nand natural runways for airplanes and spacecraft. Ground-vehicle speed\r\nrecords are commonly established on Bonneville Speedway, a race track on\r\nthe Great Salt Lake hardpan. Space shuttles land on Rogers Lake Playa at\r\nEdwards Air Force Base, California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Qaidam Depression in China is the highest desert in\r\nthe world. This Landsat image illustrates a salt lake and evaporite\r\nbasins in the depression.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Eolian Processes\r\n\r\n\r\nEolian processes pertain to the activity of the winds. Winds may erode,\r\ntransport, and deposit materials, and are effective agents in regions\r\nwith sparse vegetation and a large supply of unconsolidated sediments.\r\nAlthough water is much more powerful than wind, eolian processes are\r\nimportant in arid environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Eolian erosion\r\n\r\nWind erodes the Earth’s surface by deflation, the removal of loose,\r\nfine-grained particles by the turbulent eddy action of the wind, and by\r\nabrasion, the wearing down of surfaces by the grinding action and sand\r\nblasting of windborne particles.\r\n\r\nMost eolian deflation zones are composed of _desert pavement_, a\r\nsheetlike surface of rock fragments that remains after wind and water\r\nhave removed the fine particles. Almost half of the Earth’s desert\r\nsurfaces are stony deflation zones. The rock mantle in desert pavements\r\nprotects the underlying material from deflation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sand and rock of China’s Turpan Depression resemble\r\nclosely those in the view of the Martian surface on page 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The arrow points to shiny black desert varnish on these\r\nrocks of Egypt’s southwest desert (photograph by Carol Breed).]\r\n\r\nA dark, shiny stain, called _desert varnish_ or rock varnish, is often\r\nfound on surfaces of some desert rocks that have been exposed at the\r\nsurface for a long period of time. Manganese, iron oxides, hydroxides,\r\nand clay minerals form most varnishes and provide the shine.\r\n\r\nDeflation basins, called _blowouts_, are hollows formed by the removal\r\nof particles by wind. Blowouts are generally small, but may be up to\r\nseveral kilometers in diameter.\r\n\r\nWind-driven grains abrade landforms. Grinding by particles carried in\r\nthe wind creates grooves or small depressions. _Ventifacts_ are rocks\r\nwhich have been cut, and sometimes polished, by the abrasive action of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nSculpted landforms, called _yardangs_, are up to tens of meters high and\r\nkilometers long and are forms that have been streamlined by desert\r\nwinds. The famous sphinx at Giza in Egypt may be a modified yardang.\r\n\r\n    Yardangs of the Lut Desert of Iran. These yardangs are among the\r\n          largest on Earth, with almost 100 meters of relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Landsat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from high-altitude photograph (photograph by U.S.\r\nAir Force).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from low-altitude photograph (photograph by J.T.\r\nDaniels).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Eolian transportation\r\n\r\nParticles are transported by winds through suspension, saltation, and\r\ncreep.\r\n\r\nSmall particles may be held in the atmosphere in _suspension_. Upward\r\ncurrents of air support the weight of suspended particles and hold them\r\nindefinitely in the surrounding air. Typical winds near the Earth’s\r\nsurface suspend particles less than 0.2 millimeters in diameter and\r\nscatter them aloft as dust or haze.\r\n\r\n_Saltation_ is downwind movement of particles in a series of jumps or\r\nskips. Saltation normally lifts sand-size particles no more than one\r\ncentimeter above the ground, and proceeds at one-half to one-third the\r\nspeed of the wind. A saltating grain may hit other grains that jump up\r\nto continue the saltation. The grain may also hit larger grains that are\r\ntoo heavy to hop, but that slowly _creep_ forward as they are pushed by\r\nsaltating grains. Surface creep accounts for as much as 25 percent of\r\ngrain movement in a desert.\r\n\r\nEolian turbidity currents are better known as _dust storms_. Air over\r\ndeserts is cooled significantly when rain passes through it. This cooler\r\nand denser air sinks toward the desert surface. When it reaches the\r\nground, the air is deflected forward and sweeps up surface debris in its\r\nturbulence as a dust storm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saltation moves small particles in the direction of the\r\nwind in a series of short hops or skips.]\r\n\r\nCrops, people, villages, and possibly even climates are affected by dust\r\nstorms. Some dust storms are intercontinental, a few may circle the\r\nglobe, and occasionally they may engulf entire planets. When the Mariner\r\n9 spacecraft arrived at Mars in 1971, the entire planet was enshrouded\r\nin global dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dust storm along the Mohave River near Daggett,\r\nCalifornia, October 24, 1919 (photograph by D. G. Thompson).]\r\n\r\nMost of the dust carried by dust storms is in the form of silt-size\r\nparticles. Deposits of this windblown silt are known as _loess_. The\r\nthickest known deposit of loess, 335 meters, is on the Loess Plateau in\r\nChina. In Europe and in the Americas, accumulations of loess are\r\ngenerally from 20 to 30 meters thick.\r\n\r\nSmall whirlwinds, called _dust devils_, are common in arid lands and are\r\nthought to be related to very intense local heating of the air that\r\nresults in instabilities of the air mass. Dust devils may be as much as\r\none kilometer high.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Eolian deposition\r\n\r\nWind-deposited materials hold clues to past as well as to present wind\r\ndirections and intensities. These features help us understand the\r\npresent climate and the forces that molded it. Wind-deposited sand\r\nbodies occur as sand sheets, ripples, and dunes.\r\n\r\n_Sand sheets_ are flat, gently undulating sandy plots of sand surfaced\r\nby grains that may be too large for saltation. They form approximately\r\n40 percent of eolian depositional surfaces. The Selima Sand Sheet, which\r\noccupies 60,000 square kilometers in southern Egypt and northern Sudan,\r\nis one of the Earth’s largest sand sheets. The Selima is absolutely flat\r\nin some places; in others, active dunes move over its surface.\r\n\r\nWind blowing on a sand surface _ripples_ the surface into crests and\r\ntroughs whose long axes are perpendicular to the wind direction. The\r\naverage length of jumps during saltation corresponds to the wavelength,\r\nor distance between adjacent crests, of the ripples. In ripples, the\r\ncoarsest materials collect at the crests. This distinguishes small\r\nripples from dunes, where the coarsest materials are generally in the\r\ntroughs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wind-blown sand moves up the gentle upwind side of the\r\ndune by saltation or creep. Sand accumulates at the brink, the top of\r\nthe slipface. When the buildup of sand at the brink exceeds the angle of\r\nrepose, a small avalanche of grains slides down the slipface. Grain by\r\ngrain, the dune moves downwind.]\r\n\r\nAccumulations of sediment blown by the wind into a mound or ridge, dunes\r\nhave gentle upwind slopes on the wind-facing side. The downwind portion\r\nof the dune, the lee slope, is commonly a steep avalanche slope referred\r\nto as a _slipface_. Dunes may have more than one slipface. The minimum\r\nheight of a slipface is about 30 centimeters.\r\n\r\nSand grains move up the dune’s gentle upwind slope by saltation and\r\ncreep. When particles at the brink of the dune exceed the angle of\r\nrepose, they spill over in a tiny landslide or avalanche that reforms\r\nthe slipface. As the avalanching continues, the dune moves in the\r\ndirection of the wind.\r\n\r\nSome of the most significant experimental measurements on eolian sand\r\nmovement were performed by Ralph Bagnold, a British engineer who worked\r\nin Egypt prior to World War II. Bagnold investigated the physics of\r\nparticles moving through the atmosphere and deposited by wind. He\r\nrecognized two basic dune types, the crescentic dune, which he called\r\n“barchan,” and the linear dune, which he called longitudinal or “sief”\r\n(Arabic for “sword”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sand dunes in Death Valley, California (photograph by\r\nRichard Frear).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ripples on a dune in Eureka Valley, California\r\n(photograph by Terrence Moore).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Types of Dunes\r\n\r\n\r\nA worldwide inventory of deserts has been developed using images from\r\nthe Landsat satellites and from space and aerial photography. It defines\r\nfive basic types of dunes: _crescentic_, _linear_, _star_, _dome_, and\r\n_parabolic_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These crescentic dunes of coastal Peru are migrating\r\ntoward the left (photograph by John McCauley).]\r\n\r\nThe most common dune form on Earth and on Mars is the _crescentic_.\r\nCrescent-shaped mounds generally are wider than long. The slipface is on\r\nthe dune’s concave side. These dunes form under winds that blow from one\r\ndirection, and they also are known as barchans, or transverse dunes.\r\nSome types of crescentic dunes move faster over desert surfaces than any\r\nother type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 meters per year\r\nbetween 1954 and 1959 in China’s Ningxia Province; similar rates have\r\nbeen recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The largest crescentic\r\ndunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than 3\r\nkilometers, are in China’s Taklimakan Desert.\r\n\r\nStraight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer than they\r\nare wide are known as _linear dunes_. They may be more than 160\r\nkilometers long. Linear dunes may occur as isolated ridges, but they\r\ngenerally form sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand,\r\ngravel, or rocky interdune corridors. Some linear dunes merge to form\r\nY-shaped compound dunes. Many form in bidirectional wind regimes. The\r\nlong axes of these dunes extend in the resultant direction of sand\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Star dunes, such as these of the Namib, indicate the\r\nwinds that formed them blew from many directions (photograph by Georg\r\nGerster).]\r\n\r\nRadially symmetrical, _star dunes_ are pyramidal sand mounds with\r\nslipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the\r\nmound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind\r\nregimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the\r\nGrand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around\r\nthe margins of the sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers. In\r\nthe southeast Badain Jaran Desert of China, the star dunes are up to 500\r\nmeters tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Linear dunes advance on small playas east of Lake Eyre in\r\nthe Simpson Desert of central Australia (photograph by C. Twidale).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Linear dunes in the Western Desert of Egypt (photograph\r\nby Carol Breed).]\r\n\r\nOval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface, _dome dunes_ are\r\nrare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.\r\n\r\nU-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are\r\n_parabolic dunes_. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, blowout,\r\nor hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike\r\ncrescentic dunes, their crests point upwind. The elongated arms of\r\nparabolic dunes follow rather than lead because they have been fixed by\r\nvegetation, while the bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward. The\r\nlongest known parabolic dune has a trailing arm 12 kilometers long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small crescentic dunes occur on the crests of these\r\ncomplex dome dunes of Saudi Arabia’s Empty Quarter (photograph by Elwood\r\nFriesen).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ripples and horns of this crescentic dune in Egypt\r\nindicate that the dune is moving right to left (photograph by John\r\nOlsen).]\r\n\r\nOccurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, _reversing\r\ndunes_ are varieties of any of the above types. These dunes typically\r\nhave major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nAll these dune types may occur in three forms: _simple_, _compound_, and\r\n_complex_. Simple dunes are basic forms with a minimum number of\r\nslipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes\r\non which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are\r\nsuperimposed, and complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune\r\ntypes. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is\r\nthe most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that\r\nhas not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the\r\ndune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and\r\ndirection of the wind has changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The northern Mojave Desert. The Landsat Thematic Mapper\r\n(TM) acquires data in seven bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. On\r\nthis image, white and yellow colors indicate rocks rich in clay minerals\r\nand limonite in rocks of red and yellow hues. The large concentrations\r\nof limonite and clays may indicate mineral deposits exposed at the\r\nsurface or buried up to several thousand feet below it (photograph\r\ncourtesy of Melvin Podwysocki).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Remote Sensing of Arid Lands\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world’s deserts are generally remote, inaccessible, and\r\ninhospitable. Hidden among them, however, are hydrocarbon reservoirs,\r\nevaporites, and other mineral deposits, as well as human artifacts\r\npreserved for centuries by the arid climate. In these harsh\r\nenvironments, the information and perspective required to increase our\r\nunderstanding of arid-land geology and resources often depends on\r\nremote-sensing methods. Remote sensing is the collection of information\r\nabout an object without being in direct physical contact with it.\r\n\r\nRemote-sensing instruments in Earth-orbit satellites measure radar,\r\nvisible light, and infrared radiation. Radar imaging systems provide\r\ntheir own source of electromagnetic energy, so they can operate at any\r\ntime of day or night. Additionally, clouds and all but the most severe\r\nstorms are transparent to radar.\r\n\r\nThe first Shuttle Imaging Radar System (SIR-A), flown on the U.S. space\r\nshuttle _Columbia_ in 1981, recorded images that show buried fluvial\r\ntopography, faults, and intrusive bodies otherwise concealed beneath\r\nsand sheets and dunes of the Western Desert in Egypt and the Sudan. Most\r\nof these features are not visible from the ground. The radar signal\r\npenetrated loose dry sands and returned images of buried river channels\r\nnot visible at the surface. These images helped find new archeologic\r\nsites and sources of potable water in the desert. These “radar rivers”\r\nare the remnants of a now vanished major river system that flowed across\r\nAfrica some 20 million years before the development of the Nile River\r\nsystem. Radar imagery also is a powerful tool for exploring for placer\r\nmineral deposits in arid lands.\r\n\r\nIn 1972, the United States launched the first of a group of unmanned\r\nsatellites collectively known as Landsat. Landsat satellites carry\r\nsensors that record “light,” or portions of the electromagnetic\r\nspectrum, as it reflects off the Earth. Landsat acquires digital data\r\nthat are converted into an image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Landsat simulated true color mosaic (left) shows the\r\nSelima Sand Sheet covering all but rocky areas of the Sahara Desert in\r\nSudan. On the right, a 50-kilometer-wide strip of Shuttle Imaging Radar,\r\nSIR-A, is placed over the Landsat mosaic to reveal old stream channels\r\nand geologic structures like these. Structures that are otherwise\r\ninvisible under the surface sands are potential sources of water, placer\r\nminerals, ancient artifacts, and information on changes of climate in\r\narid areas (courtesy of USGS Image Processing Facility, Flagstaff).]\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of vegetation makes spectral remote sensing especially\r\neffective in arid lands. Rocks containing limonite, a hydrous iron\r\noxide, may be identified readily from Landsat Multispectral Scanner\r\ndata. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has increased our ability to\r\ndetect and map the distribution of minerals in volcanic rocks and\r\nrelated mineral deposits in arid and semiarid lands.\r\n\r\nMore than a million images of Earth have been acquired by the Landsat\r\nsatellites. A Landsat image may be viewed as a single band in\r\nblack-and-white, or as a combination represented by three colors, called\r\na color composite. The most widely used Landsat color image is called a\r\nfalse-color composite because it reproduces the infrared band (invisible\r\nto the naked eye) as red, the red band as green, and the green band as\r\nblue. Healthy vegetation in a false-color composite is red.\r\n\r\nDesert studies still are hampered in many regions by lack of accurate\r\nclimate data. Most desert weather stations are in oases surrounded by\r\ntrees and buildings and have been subjected to many location and\r\nelevation changes throughout the life of the station. Data from oases do\r\nnot reflect conditions from the surrounding desert. A wide variety of\r\ninstruments has been used to record measurements over varying lengths of\r\ntime and in different formats, making data difficult to interpret and\r\ncompare.\r\n\r\nTo overcome some of these problems in deserts of the American Southwest,\r\nthe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) established its Desert Winds Project\r\nto measure in a standard format several key meteorologic characteristics\r\nof arid lands. Project scientists have successfully established\r\ninstrument stations to measure wind-speed, including peak gusts, which\r\nalter the landforms the most. A station recorded a windstorm near\r\nVicksburg, Arizona, for example, with peak gusts of almost 150\r\nkilometers per hour. Using low-maintenance, automatic, solar-powered\r\nsensors, the stations also measure wind direction, precipitation,\r\nhumidity, soil and air temperatures, and barometric pressure at specific\r\nheights above the surface. Data are sampled at 6-minute intervals and\r\ntransmitted every 30 minutes to a Geostationary Operational\r\nEnvironmental Satellite (GOES). From GOES, the data are transmitted to\r\nthe USGS laboratory in Flagstaff, Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe Desert Winds Project’s investigators combine analyses of data with\r\ndetailed geologic field studies and repetitive remote-sensing coverage\r\nin order to investigate and understand the long-term changes produced by\r\nwind in deserts of differing geologic and climatic types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This geometeorologic station of the Desert Winds Project\r\nmeasures wind speed and direction, soil and air temperature, and\r\nprecipitation and humidity in the Great Basin Desert (photograph by\r\nCarol Breed).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nitrate workings in a broad valley in the Atacama Desert\r\nof northern Chile, where saline-cemented surficial deposits formed near\r\na playa lake (photograph by George Ericksen).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Mineral Resources in Deserts\r\n\r\n\r\nSome mineral deposits are formed, improved, or preserved by geologic\r\nprocesses that occur in arid lands as a consequence of climate. Ground\r\nwater leaches ore minerals and redeposits them in zones near the water\r\ntable. This leaching process concentrates these minerals as ore that can\r\nbe mined. Of the 15 major types of mineral deposits in the Western\r\nHemisphere formed by action of ground water, 13 occur in deserts.\r\n\r\nEvaporation in arid lands enriches mineral accumulation in their lakes.\r\nPlayas may be sources of mineral deposits formed by evaporation. Water\r\nevaporating in closed basins precipitates minerals such as gypsum, salts\r\n(including sodium nitrate and sodium chloride), and borates. The\r\nminerals formed in these evaporite deposits depend on the composition\r\nand temperature of the saline waters at the time of deposition.\r\n\r\nSignificant evaporite resources occur in the Great Basin Desert of the\r\nUnited States, mineral deposits made forever famous by the “20-mule\r\nteams” that once hauled borax-laden wagons from Death Valley to the\r\nrailroad. Boron, from borax and borate evaporites, is an essential\r\ningredient in the manufacture of glass, ceramics, enamel, agricultural\r\nchemicals, water softeners, and pharmaceuticals. Borates are mined from\r\nevaporite deposits at Searles Lake, California, and other desert\r\nlocations. The total value of chemicals that have been produced from\r\nSearles Lake substantially exceeds $1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Atacama Desert of South America is unique among the deserts of the\r\nworld in its great abundance of saline minerals. Sodium nitrate has been\r\nmined for explosives and fertilizer in the Atacama since the middle of\r\nthe 19th century. Nearly 3 million metric tons were mined during World\r\nWar I.\r\n\r\nValuable minerals located in arid lands include copper in the United\r\nStates, Chile, Peru, and Iran; iron and lead-zinc ore in Australia;\r\nchromite in Turkey; and gold, silver, and uranium deposits in Australia\r\nand the United States. Nonmetallic mineral resources and rocks such as\r\nberyllium, mica, lithium, clays, pumice, and scoria also occur in arid\r\nregions. Sodium carbonate, sulfate, borate, nitrate, lithium, bromine,\r\niodine, calcium, and strontium compounds come from sediments and\r\nnearsurface brines formed by evaporation of inland bodies of water,\r\noften during geologically recent times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This open-pit mine in the Sonoran Desert near Ajo,\r\nArizona, has exposed an elliptical copper deposit about 1,000 meters\r\nlong and 750 meters wide. The copper ore mined here is in a bed that\r\naverages 150 meters in thickness (photograph by Peter Kresan).]\r\n\r\nThe Green River Formation of Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah contains\r\nalluvial fan deposits and playa evaporites created in a huge lake whose\r\nlevel fluctuated for millions of years. Economically significant\r\ndeposits of trona, a major source of sodium compounds, and thick layers\r\nof oil shale were created in the arid environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trona mine at Searles Lake, California (photograph by\r\nJohn Keith).]\r\n\r\nSome of the more productive petroleum areas on Earth are found in arid\r\nand semiarid regions of Africa and the Mideast, although the oil\r\nreservoirs were originally formed in shallow marine environments. Recent\r\nclimate change has placed these reservoirs in an arid environment.\r\n\r\nOther oil reservoirs, however, are presumed to be eolian in origin and\r\nare presently found in humid environments. The Rotliegendes, a\r\nhydrocarbon reservoir in the North Sea, is associated with extensive\r\nevaporite deposits. Many of the major U.S. hydrocarbon resources may\r\ncome from eolian sands. Ancient alluvial fan sequences may also be\r\nhydrocarbon reservoirs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sahelian drought that began in 1968 was responsible\r\nfor the deaths of between 100,000 and 250,000 people, the disruption of\r\nmillions of lives, and the collapse of the agricultural bases of five\r\ncountries (photograph by Daniel Stiles, UNEP).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Desertification\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world’s great deserts were formed by natural processes interacting\r\nover long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have\r\ngrown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts, large\r\nsand seas now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, extend\r\nwell beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the Sahara. In\r\nsome regions, deserts are separated sharply from surrounding, less arid\r\nareas by mountains and other contrasting landforms that reflect basic\r\nstructural differences in the regional geology. In other areas, desert\r\nfringes form a gradual transition from a dry to a more humid\r\nenvironment, making it more difficult to define the desert border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Overgrazing has made the Rio Puerco Basin of central New\r\nMexico one of the most eroded river basins of the American West and has\r\nincreased the high sediment content of the river (photograph by Terrence\r\nMoore).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Linear dunes of the Sahara Desert encroach on Nouakchott,\r\nthe capital of Mauritania. The dunes border a mosque at left (photograph\r\nby Georg Gerster).]\r\n\r\nThese transition zones have very fragile, delicately balanced\r\necosystems. Desert fringes often are a mosaic of microclimates. Small\r\nhollows support vegetation that picks up heat from the hot winds and\r\nprotects the land from the prevailing winds. After rainfall the\r\nvegetated areas are distinctly cooler than the surroundings. In these\r\nmarginal areas, human activity may stress the ecosystem beyond its\r\ntolerance limit, resulting in degradation of the land. By pounding the\r\nsoil with their hooves, livestock compact the substrate, increase the\r\nproportion of fine material, and reduce the percolation rate of the\r\nsoil, thus encouraging erosion by wind and water. Grazing and the\r\ncollection of firewood reduces or eliminates plants that help to bind\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThis degradation of formerly productive land—_desertification_—is a\r\ncomplex process. It involves multiple causes, and it proceeds at varying\r\nrates in different climates. Desertification may intensify a general\r\nclimatic trend toward greater aridity, or it may initiate a change in\r\nlocal climate.\r\n\r\nDesertification does not occur in linear, easily mappable patterns.\r\nDeserts advance erratically, forming patches on their borders. Areas far\r\nfrom natural deserts can degrade quickly to barren soil, rock, or sand\r\nthrough poor land management. The presence of a nearby desert has no\r\ndirect relationship to desertification. Unfortunately, an area\r\nundergoing desertification is brought to public attention only after the\r\nprocess is well underway. Often little or no data are available to\r\nindicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the rate of degradation.\r\nScientists still question whether desertification, as a process of\r\nglobal change, is permanent or how and when it can be halted or\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camels and other animals trample the soil in the semiarid\r\nSahel of Africa as they move to water holes such as this one in Chad\r\n(photograph courtesy of the U.S. Agency for International Development).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Problem\r\n\r\nDesertification became well known in the 1930’s, when parts of the Great\r\nPlains in the United States turned into the “Dust Bowl” as a result of\r\ndrought and poor practices in farming, although the term itself was not\r\nused until almost 1950. During the dust bowl period, millions of people\r\nwere forced to abandon their farms and livelihoods. Greatly improved\r\nmethods of agriculture and land and water management in the Great Plains\r\nhave prevented that disaster from recurring, but desertification\r\npresently affects millions of people in almost every continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Off-road vehicles significantly increase soil loss in the\r\ndelicate desert environment of the western United States. In a few\r\nseconds, soils that took hundreds of years to develop can be destroyed\r\n(photograph by Terrence Moore).]\r\n\r\nIncreased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands has\r\naccelerated desertification. In some areas, nomads moving to less arid\r\nareas disrupt the local ecosystem and increase the rate of erosion of\r\nthe land. Nomads are trying to escape the desert, but because of their\r\nland-use practices, they are bringing the desert with them.\r\n\r\nIt is a misconception that droughts cause desertification. Droughts are\r\ncommon in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from\r\ndrought when the rains return. Continued land abuse during droughts,\r\nhowever, increases land degradation. By 1973, the drought that began in\r\n1968 in the Sahel of West Africa and the land-use practices there had\r\ncaused the deaths of more than 100,000 people and 12 million cattle, as\r\nwell as the disruption of social organizations from villages to the\r\nnational level.\r\n\r\nWhile desertification has received tremendous publicity by the political\r\nand news media, there are still many things that we don’t know about the\r\ndegradation of productive lands and the expansion of deserts. In 1988\r\nRidley Nelson pointed out in an important scientific paper that the\r\ndesertification problem and processes are not clearly defined. There is\r\nno consensus among researchers as to the specific causes, extent, or\r\ndegree of desertification. Contrary to many popular reports,\r\ndesertification is actually a subtle and complex process of\r\ndeterioration that may often be reversible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goat seeks food in the sparsely vegetated Sahel of Africa\r\n(photograph courtesy of the U.S. Agency for International Development).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Global monitoring\r\n\r\nIn the last 25 years, satellites have begun to provide the global\r\nmonitoring necessary for improving our understanding of desertification.\r\nLandsat images of the same area, taken several years apart but during\r\nthe same point in the growing season, may indicate changes in the\r\nsusceptibility of land to desertification. Studies using Landsat data\r\nhelp demonstrate the impact of people and animals on the Earth. However,\r\nother types of remote-sensing systems, land-monitoring networks, and\r\nglobal data bases of field observations are needed before the process\r\nand problems of desertification will be completely understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Local remedies\r\n\r\nAt the local level, individuals and governments can help to reclaim and\r\nprotect their lands. In areas of sand dunes, covering the dunes with\r\nlarge boulders or petroleum will interrupt the wind regime near the face\r\nof the dunes and prevent the sand from moving. Sand fences are used\r\nthroughout the Middle East and the United States, in the same way snow\r\nfences are used in the north. Placement of straw grids, each up to a\r\nsquare meter in area, will also decrease the surface wind velocity.\r\nShrubs and trees planted within the grids are protected by the straw\r\nuntil they take root. In areas where some water is available for\r\nirrigation, shrubs planted on the lower one-third of a dune’s windward\r\nside will stabilize the dune. This vegetation decreases the wind\r\nvelocity near the base of the dune and prevents much of the sand from\r\nmoving. Higher velocity winds at the top of the dune level it off and\r\ntrees can be planted atop these flattened surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Straw grids (one of which is shown above) and vegetation\r\nirrigated by water from the Yellow River stabilize dunes in this part of\r\nChina’s Tengger Desert (shown below) and protect a nearby railroad from\r\nwindblown sand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tengger Desert]\r\n\r\nOases and farmlands in windy regions can be protected by planting tree\r\nfences or grass belts. Sand that manages to pass through the grass belts\r\ncan be caught in strips of trees planted as wind breaks 50 to 100 meters\r\napart adjacent to the belts. Small plots of trees may also be scattered\r\ninside oases to stabilize the area. On a much larger scale, a “Green\r\nWall,” which will eventually stretch more than 5,700 kilometers in\r\nlength, much longer than the famous Great Wall, is being planted in\r\nnortheastern China to protect “sandy lands”—deserts believed to have\r\nbeen created by human activity.\r\n\r\nMore efficient use of existing water resources and control of\r\nsalinization are other effective tools for improving arid lands. New\r\nways are being sought to use surface-water resources such as rain water\r\nharvesting or irrigating with seasonal runoff from adjacent highlands.\r\nNew ways are also being sought to find and tap groundwater resources and\r\nto develop more effective ways of irrigating arid and semiarid lands.\r\nResearch on the reclamation of deserts also is focusing on discovering\r\nproper crop rotation to protect the fragile soil, on understanding how\r\nsand-fixing plants can be adapted to local environments, and on how\r\ngrazing lands and water resources can be developed effectively without\r\nbeing overused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From wasteland to vineyard. Ground water and underground\r\nchannels help this vineyard flourish on land reclaimed from desert\r\npavement in China’s Turpan Depression.]\r\n\r\nIf we are to stop and reverse the degradation of arid and semiarid\r\nlands, we must understand how and why the rates of climate change,\r\npopulation growth, and food production adversely affect these\r\nenvironments. The most effective intervention can come only from the\r\nwise use of the best earth-science information available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Selected Readings\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bagnold, R.
