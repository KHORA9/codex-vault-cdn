The clearing of forests, the extension of\r\nthe areas of land under tillage, and the activities of drug collectors\r\nthreaten the extermination of a number of valuable native drug plants.\r\nAnnually, large sums of money are expended for crude drugs imported\r\nfrom countries where they are grown under conditions of soil and\r\nclimate resembling those of many localities in the United States.\r\nAs a means of guaranteeing the future supply of crude drugs and of\r\nlessening the dependence on importations, attention is now being turned\r\nto the cultivation of drug plants with a view to increasing domestic\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe problems presented by the cultivation of drug plants are not less\r\ndifficult than those encountered in the production of many other\r\ncrops. Drug plants are subject to the same diseases and risks as other\r\ncrops and are similarly affected by variations in soil and climatic\r\nconditions. They require a considerable outlay of labor, the same as\r\nother crops, and likewise require intelligent care and handling. They\r\nare subject to the same laws of supply and demand, and, like other\r\nproducts, must conform to the consumer's fancy and to definite trade\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nA number of common medicinal plants have long been cultivated in\r\ngardens in this country, either as ornamentals or as a source of herbs\r\nused in cookery and as domestic remedies. A few of these plants, such\r\nas goldenseal, wormwood, wormseed, and peppermint, have been grown\r\ncommercially for sale as crude drugs; but the acreage devoted to their\r\nproduction has been relatively small and for the most part restricted\r\nto certain localities. Other drug plants which occur as common weeds in\r\nmany places may prove to respond to cultivation; experiments should\r\nthen be undertaken to determine whether it is profitable to grow them.\r\nIn this connection it should be remembered that the soil type very\r\noften is an important limiting factor in propagating different kinds\r\nof plants. Some plants grow best in well-drained loam, some prefer a\r\nmarsh, some require soils rich in lime, while others thrive only in\r\nacid soil. The soil requirements of all plants are not understood;\r\nin fact it is not improbable that better comprehension of the soil,\r\nclimatic, and cultural conditions adapted to the different kinds of\r\nplants will enable the successful propagation of species now regarded\r\nas unsuited to cultivation. In undertaking the growing of medicinal\r\nplants, therefore, it is essential to know that the species selected\r\nfor cultivation will do well under the conditions of soil and climate\r\nexisting where the planting is to be made. When necessary, this should\r\nbe determined on small experimental plats before undertaking commercial\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the soil and climate of the situation selected are\r\nsuitable for the growing of drug plants, it does not necessarily follow\r\nthat they can be produced at a profit. The cost of production and\r\nmarketing may be greater than the amount received for the crop when it\r\nis sold. Some drug plants not well suited for cultivation on a large\r\nscale may be found profitable when grown on small areas as a side line.\r\nOn the other hand, some may be produced more cheaply when cultivated on\r\na scale large enough to warrant the use of labor-saving devices than\r\nwhen grown on small areas with the aid of hand labor alone. The value\r\nof land, the cost and availability of labor, and the possible returns\r\nfrom other crops are all factors to be considered carefully. On account\r\nof the variation in these factors according to locality, the same\r\ncrop might prove to be profitable in one location and unprofitable in\r\nanother. It is for these reasons that unqualified statements concerning\r\nthe ease and profitableness of drug plant growing should not be taken\r\ntoo seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME DRUG PLANTS SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of drug plants which may be grown in the United States\r\nis large, although the same plants are not equally adapted to the\r\nconditions of soil and climate prevailing in different sections. Often\r\nthe most suitable plants for a particular locality can not be foretold,\r\nespecially in those situations where no attempts have yet been made to\r\ngrow them. In such cases it is well to select for cultivation plants\r\nwhich thrive elsewhere under conditions most closely resembling those\r\nof the new situation in which it is proposed to grow them. The success\r\nwith which ordinary field or garden crops can be grown will in general\r\nindicate the possible suitability of a given location for growing many\r\nmedicinal plants. Since a number of native medicinal plants which\r\nin their wild state are restricted to certain localities have been\r\nsuccessfully cultivated in situations far beyond their natural range,\r\nthere are good reasons for believing that many such plants will thrive\r\nin sections where they are not now grown. However, good results can\r\nscarcely be expected unless the plants are placed under conditions\r\nsimilar to those in which they normally thrive.\r\n\r\nIn suitable soil and under favorable weather conditions the following\r\ndrug plants have been found to thrive well under cultivation in\r\nnumerous places in the Central and Eastern States and will probably\r\nbe found suitable for cultivation in many other situations if the\r\ndifference in climatic conditions is not too great:\r\n\r\n  Anise.       Conium.     Elecampane.  Sage.\r\n  Belladonna.  Coriander.  Fennel.      Stramonium.\r\n  Camomile.    Digitalis.  Henbane.     Tansy.\r\n  Caraway.     Dill.       Horehound.   Thyme.\r\n\r\nSome perennials, such as belladonna and digitalis, are only partly\r\nhardy and would be subject to winterkilling in the colder sections.\r\nSuch plants as aconite, arnica, lovage, poppy, seneca, valerian, and\r\nwormwood seem to thrive best in the northern half of the United States\r\nin situations where the rainfall is well distributed throughout the\r\ngrowing season. On the other hand, cannabis, licorice, and wormseed\r\nare better suited to the warmer climate of the southern half of the\r\nUnited States. Aletris, althaea, angelica, calamus, orris, pinkroot,\r\npeppermint, serpentaria, and spearmint are adapted generally for\r\nsituations in which the soil is rich and moist, but lavender and\r\nlarkspur are partial to well-drained sandy soil. Ginseng and goldenseal\r\noccur naturally on rich soil in the partial shade of forest trees and\r\ncan be cultivated successfully only when planted in woodlands or in\r\nspecially prepared soil under artificial shade (fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CULTURAL SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special details of cultivation for each of the medicinal plants\r\nmentioned are given under the discussion of the individual species.\r\nSuggestions which are of general application, however, are here brought\r\ntogether, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication.\r\n\r\n_Propagation._--A number of the species considered later can be grown\r\neasily from seed, but others are best propagated from cuttings or\r\nby division. Many wild medicinal plants are much more difficult to\r\npropagate from seeds than the species commonly grown in gardens.\r\nLikewise, some of the species now grown abroad and suitable for\r\ncultivation in this country are not easily propagated and require\r\nspecial conditions if good results are to be realized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Lath shed affording partial shade, especially\r\nwell suited for growing woodland plants.]\r\n\r\nSeeds of the better-known varieties of medicinal plants are regularly\r\nlisted in the catalogues of numerous seed houses, and those which are\r\nless common can usually be obtained from dealers who make a specialty\r\nof one or more of these species. Plants can frequently be obtained from\r\nnurseries or from dealers in hardy ornamentals. The catalogues of a\r\nnumber of dealers should be consulted and the varieties for propagation\r\ncarefully selected. In ordering, the medicinal variety should always be\r\ncalled for, since many of the related ornamental forms which are listed\r\nare of doubtful, if any, medicinal value.\r\n\r\n_Sowing the seed._--A relatively small number of medicinal plants can\r\nbe satisfactorily grown from seed sown in the field. In many cases this\r\nmethod is quite uncertain and with some plants wholly inadvisable.\r\nIn order to insure a good stand of thrifty plants it is frequently\r\nnecessary to make the sowings in a greenhouse, hotbed, or coldframe\r\nand at a suitable time transplant the seedlings to the field. Much\r\ninformation on seed germination, hotbeds, and coldframes can be gained\r\nby consulting Farmers' Bulletins 934, 937, and 1044, entitled,\r\nrespectively, \"Home Gardening in the South,\" \"The Farm Garden, in the\r\nNorth,\" and \"The City Home Garden.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1] These publications can be obtained free of charge upon application\r\nto the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the soil is of prime importance, whether the sowing\r\nof the seed is made in the open or under cover. Many seeds, especially\r\nthose which are very small, do not germinate well in heavy soils or in\r\nthose which are cloddy and coarse in texture. A seed bed prepared by\r\nthoroughly mixing equal parts of garden soil, leaf mold, well-rotted\r\nmanure, and clean sand will be suitable for the germination of most\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe depth of sowing is largely governed by the size of the seeds and\r\nthe character of the soil. In general, the smaller the seed the less\r\nthe depth of sowing. Seed should be covered more deeply in light\r\nsandy soil than in heavy clay soil. Fall-sown seeds also require a\r\ngreater depth of covering than those sown in the spring. The exact\r\nquantity of seed which should be used for sowing a given area can not\r\nbe definitely stated. The same kind of seed will be found to vary\r\nwidely in its power to germinate; hence, the percentage of germination\r\nshould be ascertained in advance of sowing and the quantity regulated\r\naccordingly. In general, the heavier the soil the larger the quantity\r\nof seed required. If the plants are to be thinned out or transplanted,\r\nor if they are especially subject to the attacks of insects, the free\r\nuse of seed is usually advisable.\r\n\r\nWhen plantings are made in open ground it is preferable to sow the\r\nseed in rows or drills, in order that cultivation of the soil may be\r\npossible. A shallow furrow may be opened with a rake or hand hoe and\r\nthe seed sown by hand. The rake or hoe may then be used to cover the\r\nseed with the required depth of soil. It is much more satisfactory\r\nto use seed drills, such as are commonly used by market gardeners,\r\nthan to sow by hand, since with the drill the depth of sowing is more\r\nuniform and the soil is compacted over the seeds, thus favoring good\r\ngermination. The distance between the rows is determined in part by the\r\nsize which the plants attain at maturity, but depends chiefly upon the\r\nmethod of cultivation to be used. A spacing of 9 to 16 inches between\r\nthe rows will readily permit hand cultivation, but the rows should be\r\nabout 3 feet apart if horse-drawn implements are employed.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation._--There are no set rules for the cultivation of medicinal\r\nplants, and the grower's experience with other plants must be relied\r\nupon as a guide in many of the details of cultivation. As a general\r\nrule, the soil should be worked with the hoe or cultivator at frequent\r\nintervals and kept free from weeds. It is a good practice to cultivate\r\nafter a hard rain as soon as the ground is sufficiently dry. During\r\ndry, hot weather loss of moisture from the soil will be diminished by\r\nfrequent shallow cultivations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrug roots are usually harvested in the fall or at the end of the\r\ngrowing season of the plant, but they may also be harvested early in\r\nthe spring while still dormant. Roots collected during the growing\r\nseason often shrink excessively in drying and so do not form the most\r\ndesirable product. On small areas either a spade or a potato fork is\r\na suitable tool for digging most roots; but if the area is large,\r\nlabor will be saved by using a plow to turn out the roots, especially\r\nwith such crops as belladonna or burdock. Most roots require thorough\r\nwashing, and when the quantity is large this may be easily done if the\r\nroots are placed on a frame covered with wire mesh and water is applied\r\nby means of a garden hose.\r\n\r\nAll roots must be thoroughly dried. Large or fleshy roots are usually\r\nsplit or sliced, spread in thin layers on clean floors, and stirred\r\nor turned frequently. Good ventilation is essential, as several weeks\r\nusually elapse before the roots are dry enough to be stored with\r\nsafety. The proper point of dryness is indicated when the roots break\r\nreadily on being bent. The time of drying may be reduced to a few\r\ndays by the use of artificial heat. For this purpose the walls of a\r\nwell-inclosed room are fitted with racks or shelves to receive the\r\nroots, or large trays with bottoms made of slats or wire screen are\r\nsuspended one above the other from the ceiling. The room is heated\r\nby a stove, and the temperature maintained between 125° and 150° F.\r\nVentilators must be provided at the top of the room to carry away the\r\nmoisture which is driven off from the roots. Ordinary fruit driers have\r\nbeen used successfully in drying roots on, a small scale, but special\r\ndrying houses or kilns will be necessary for successfully handling\r\ncrops grown on an acreage basis.\r\n\r\nLeaves and herbs are usually harvested when the plants are in flower.\r\nPicking the leaves by hand in the field is a slow process, and time may\r\nbe saved by cutting the entire plant and stripping the leaves after\r\nthe plants have been brought in from the field. If the entire herb is\r\nwanted, it is preferable to top the plants, for if they are cut too\r\nclose to the ground the herb will have to be picked over by hand and\r\nall the coarse stems removed. As a rule, leaves and herbs may be dried\r\nin the same manner as roots, but almost without exception they are\r\ndried without exposure to the sun, in order that the green color may be\r\nretained so far as possible.\r\n\r\nSome flowers are gathered while scarcely open and others as soon after\r\nopening as possible, and in general they should be carefully dried in\r\nthe shade to prevent discoloration. Hand picking is very laborious,\r\nand mechanical devices similar to a cranberry scoop (fig. 2) or seed\r\nstripper (fig. 3) may often be used to good advantage. A homemade\r\npicker may be constructed as follows: From a stout wooden box, about\r\n10 inches wide, 14 inches long, and 6 inches deep, remove one end and\r\nconnect the opposite remaining sides at the top with a stout strip,\r\nwhich will serve as a handle. Drive long, slender wire nails through\r\nan inch strip of wood at quarter-inch intervals, thus forming a \"comb\"\r\nthe teeth of which should be about 2 inches long. This comb is fastened\r\nto the bottom of the box in such a manner that the teeth will project\r\noutward through the opening left by the removed end. On swinging this\r\ndevice, teeth forward, through the flowers, the heads will be snapped\r\noff by the comb and will fall into the box, from which they may be\r\nemptied into suitable containers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--A berry scoop suitable for harvesting flower\r\nheads of large size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--A seed stripper which may be used for gathering\r\nflower heads.]\r\n\r\nSeeds are harvested as soon as most of them have ripened and before\r\nthe pods or seed capsules have opened. Seedlike fruits, such as anise,\r\ncoriander, fennel, and wormseed r are harvested a little before\r\nthey are fully ripe, in order that they may retain a bright, fresh\r\nappearance, which adds to their market value. The machinery used for\r\nthrashing and cleaning ordinary seed crops will frequently serve a\r\nsimilar purpose for seeds of medicinal plants, provided the proper\r\nadjustments have been made. Most seeds must be spread out to dry and\r\nturned at intervals until thoroughly dried before they can be stored in\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volatile oil obtained from many aromatic plants by steam\r\ndistillation is often their most valuable product. The equipment\r\nnecessary for distilling volatile oils consists essentially of a steam\r\nboiler, a retort, and a condenser. A constant supply of cold water\r\nmust also be available. A common type of retort consists of a circular\r\nwooden vat, about 6 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet deep (fig. 4),\r\nfitted with a removable cover, which can be made steam tight. Metal\r\nretorts made of boiler iron three-sixteenths of an inch thick and\r\njacketed with wood to prevent the radiation of heat are also used.\r\nA pipe leads from the steam boiler to the bottom of the retort and\r\nanother from the top of the retort to the condenser, one form of which\r\nconsists of a coil of tin-lined or galvanized-iron pipe inclosed in a\r\njacket through which cold water is kept flowing when the still is in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--A still used in the production of wormwood oil.]\r\n\r\nWhen the retort is filled with aromatic plants and steam is admitted\r\nthrough the pipe from the boiler, the volatile oil is extracted in\r\nthe form of a vapor, which is carried over with the steam to the\r\ncondenser, where both are condensed to liquid form. The oil and water\r\ntogether flow from the condenser into the receiver, one type of which\r\nis constructed like an ordinary milk can and is fitted with a siphon\r\nleading from the bottom, through which the water is drawn off to\r\nprevent the receiver from overflowing.\r\n\r\nMany volatile oils will float on the water and may be drawn off from\r\nthe top of the receiver at will. Other oils, such as sassafras and\r\nwintergreen, are heavier than water, and should be collected in a\r\nreceiver provided at the bottom with an outlet tap through which the\r\noil may be drawn off.\r\n\r\nThe cost of setting up a still will depend upon what facilities are\r\nalready at hand and upon the size and efficiency of the apparatus\r\ninstalled. It may easily range from a small sum to several thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yield that can be obtained from drug plants in different localities\r\nwill naturally vary according to the suitability of the situation for\r\nthe plants selected for cultivation. Even in the same locality wide\r\nvariations in yield will result from differences in the lay of the land\r\nand in soil, drainage, and seasonal conditions. The skill of the grower\r\nand the degree of care and attention which he bestows upon his crop are\r\nalso factors affecting yield.\r\n\r\nMany of the drug plants mentioned in this bulletin have not been\r\ngrown on a scale large enough to give a very satisfactory basis for\r\ncalculating yields. Acreage yields calculated from the product of small\r\ngarden plats are generally untrustworthy, since in such plats the\r\nplants are usually more favorably situated with respect to soil and are\r\ngiven better culture than when under field conditions. Moreover, as the\r\narea increases, it becomes more difficult to maintain an approximately\r\nperfect stand and to protect the crop from the ravages of insects or\r\nother destructive agencies. The returns from small experimental areas\r\ncan at most be regarded as only an indication of the yield that may be\r\nexpected under favorable conditions, and the prospective grower will\r\ndo well to proceed cautiously until he has determined for himself the\r\npossibilities of yield in his particular location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial grower of drug plants can not give too much attention to\r\nthe problem of securing a satisfactory market for his product. Growers\r\nwho live near the cities in which dealers in crude drugs are located\r\nor in sections where wild medicinal plants are collected may be able\r\nto find a local market, but in many situations the local marketing of\r\ncrude drugs in quantity will not be possible. In such cases the grower\r\nshould send samples of his product to dealers in crude drugs or to\r\nmanufacturers of pharmaceutical preparations and request them to name\r\na price at which they would purchase his crop. The material for the\r\nsamples should not be specially selected or so prepared as to represent\r\na quality higher than that of the whole lot, since this would give the\r\npurchaser just cause for making a reduction in price on delivery or for\r\nrejecting the whole shipment. It is well to send samples to a number\r\nof dealers, since their prices will be found to vary with the stock on\r\nhand and trade prospects. Before selling, the state of the wholesale\r\ndrug market should be learned. The prices to producers are, of course,\r\nalways lower than the wholesale price; nevertheless, the grower who is\r\ninformed in respect to the wholesale market will be in a position to\r\njudge of the fairness of the prices offered for his crop by dealers.\r\n\r\nUnder special conditions some crude drugs can be sold at a material\r\nadvance over the prevailing market price. By always supplying a\r\nwell-prepared, carefully selected drug of high quality some growers\r\nhave built up a trade in their particular product for which they secure\r\nextra good prices. Dealers and manufacturers also sometimes make\r\ncontracts with reliable growers to take the entire crop of a particular\r\ndrug, thus insuring to the grower a definite market and good prices for\r\nthe product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1919 there existed a general and widespread\r\nshortage in botanical crude drugs, and prices in consequence had\r\nreached unusually high levels. The demand in other lines for unskilled\r\nlabor at high wages has attracted elsewhere many persons who were\r\nformerly engaged in the collection or production of botanic drugs in\r\nthis country. It is therefore probable that prices for most crude drugs\r\nwill remain at a high level until the prices of other commodities\r\nundergo a general reduction and the present supply of labor greatly\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nAlthough the average value of crude drugs, expressed in terms of\r\nmoney, has more than doubled since 1913, it does not follow that\r\ntheir production offers a corresponding increase in profit to the\r\nproducer. The prices of food and clothing, labor, and supplies of\r\nall kinds have for the most part more than doubled in the same time\r\nand the prospective producer of crude drugs will do well to consider\r\ncarefully the comparative prices of the necessities of life which he\r\nmust purchase before he engages in this enterprise. The unusually high\r\nprices now offered for many crude drugs are due to the underproduction,\r\nwhich has resulted largely from labor conditions and do not necessarily\r\nindicate any large increase in the demand for consumption. In view of\r\nthe present disturbed economic conditions and the uncertainty as to the\r\nfuture course of prices, the general stimulation of drug growing in\r\nthis country does not appear to be the best policy at this time.\r\n\r\nHowever desirable it may be to increase the available supply of\r\ncrude drugs or to diminish the amount of money now sent to foreign\r\ncountries for these products, the most important consideration for\r\nthe American farmer who would grow drug plants is the probable\r\nprofit to be derived from such an enterprise. Many statements to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding, the commercial production of crude drugs\r\ndoes not normally present unusual opportunities for quick returns and\r\nlarge profits. Knowledge respecting the cultivation and handling of\r\nmedicinal-plant crops is far less widespread than in the case of such\r\ngenerally distributed crops as fruits, vegetables, and cereals, and\r\ncertain individuals have taken advantage of this lack of information\r\nto lead the public to believe that extraordinary profits may be\r\nrealized from growing medicinal plants, even in a situation no more\r\npromising than the average city back yard. Such persons are interested\r\nusually only in the sale of the plants and seeds for propagation or\r\nthe questionable directions for their cultivation, and the extravagant\r\nclaims often set forth in their alluring advertisements are not only\r\nmisleading, but frequently have little basis in fact.\r\n\r\nThe market demand for any given crude drug is naturally a large factor\r\nin determining the prospects for its commercial production under\r\ncultivation. The demand for a number of drugs is quite variable or\r\nexceedingly limited, and hence insufficient to make it advisable to\r\nraise them on a large scale. In the case of other drugs, although\r\nthe demand is fairly constant and steady, it could probably be fully\r\nsatisfied by the product of a very few acres of good land. It is\r\nevident that the cultivation of any considerable acreage might easily\r\nresult in overproduction, with a consequent decline in market price to\r\na point where production would not be profitable.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of drug plants, to be successful in this country, will\r\nprobably require the introduction of improved methods and the extensive\r\nuse of machinery to replace hand labor so far as possible. Growers\r\nof mints and numerous other plants yielding essential oils will find\r\nit desirable to equip themselves with a suitable distilling plant,\r\nalthough the latter can not be operated most economically when only a\r\nsmall quantity of material is available for distillation. The natural\r\ntendency will be to increase the acreage in the interest of more\r\nefficient operation, but here again there is danger of overproduction,\r\nand prospective growers should thoroughly acquaint themselves with\r\nmarket conditions before bringing very large areas under cultivation.\r\n\r\nVery few, if any, drug plants are used in quantities sufficient to make\r\nthem a promising crop for general cultivation. Many of the common ones,\r\nwhich can be grown and prepared for market with little difficulty,\r\nbring but a few cents a pound, and their cultivation offers little\r\nprospect of profit. A number of the high-priced drug plants must be\r\ngiven care for two or more years before a crop can be harvested, and,\r\nsince expensive equipment is usually required for their successful\r\nculture, the production of such crops offers little encouragement to\r\ninexperienced growers who are looking for quick returns and large\r\nprofits from a small investment. The production of drugs of high\r\nquality requires skilled management, experience in special methods of\r\nplant culture, acquaintance with trade requirements, and a knowledge of\r\nthe influence of time of collection and manner of preparation on the\r\nconstituents of the drug which determine its value. Small quantities\r\nof drugs produced without regard to these conditions are apt to be\r\npoor in quality and so unattractive to dealers and manufacturers that\r\nthe product will not be salable at a price sufficient to make their\r\nproduction profitable. In general, the conditions in this country seem\r\nfar more favorable to the growing of drug plants as a special industry\r\nfor well-equipped cultivators than as a side crop for general farmers\r\nor those whose chief interest lies in the production of other crops.\r\n\r\nAlthough a number of plants which yield products used as crude drugs\r\nare common farm weeds, they usually occur in scattered situations and\r\nin such small quantities that their collection would scarcely prove\r\nprofitable for the farmer. Even when relatively abundant it is a matter\r\nfor careful consideration whether the time and labor necessary for\r\ntheir collection might not be otherwise employed to better advantage.\r\nMoreover, it is not always easy to distinguish medicinal plants from\r\nothers of similar appearance, and collectors not infrequently find that\r\nthey have spent their time in gathering plants practically worthless as\r\ncrude drugs. In proportion to the labor required in their collection,\r\nrelatively low prices are paid for most crude drugs obtained from wild\r\nplants, and the farmer who turns to drug collecting as a source of\r\nadditional revenue will probably meet with disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULTIVATION AND HANDLING OF DRUG PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following cultural directions and suggestions regarding the\r\nhandling of a number of drug plants have been compiled in part from the\r\nrecords of the Office of Drug, Poisonous, and Oil Plant Investigations\r\nand include data secured by various members of the staff of that office\r\nconnected with testing gardens in several widely separated localities.\r\nThe probable yields per acre are in many cases estimates calculated\r\nfrom smaller areas, and considerable variation from the figures given\r\nmust be expected in actual practice. The prices mentioned are given\r\nmerely to indicate the comparative value of the products concerned and\r\nnot to fix the actual price which the grower of drug plants may expect\r\nto receive. This will depend very largely upon the state of the market\r\nat the time the crop is offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe plants mentioned in the following pages were selected for\r\ndiscussion because information regarding their cultivation is in\r\nconstant demand. The purpose of this bulletin is not to recommend\r\nthese plants for cultivation, but to give information concerning\r\ntheir culture which may be helpful to persons who are considering the\r\nproduction of drug plants on a commercial scale.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] For information in regard to weeds used in medicine not herein\r\nconsidered, see Farmers' Bulletin No. 188, which may be obtained from\r\nthe Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, for 5\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALETRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAletris, star-grass, or true unicorn root (_Aletris farinosa_, fig.\r\n5) is a native perennial herb of the lily family, found occasionally\r\non sandy soil throughout the eastern half of the United States; also\r\nfrequently occurring in the pine and oak barrens of Alabama and\r\nTennessee and elsewhere in the South. The root is used medicinally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Aletris (_Aletris farinosa_).]\r\n\r\nAletris is a slow-growing plant which seems to thrive best on a moist\r\nand sandy soil. It may be propagated either by division of the root\r\nstocks or from seeds. The seeds mature late in the summer, and should\r\nbe sown soon after ripening, in a well-prepared and protected seed bed.\r\nIn the following spring the seedlings may be transplanted to their\r\npermanent situation and set about a foot apart in rows 20 inches or\r\nmore apart. The soil about the plants should be stirred frequently and\r\nkept free from weeds.\r\n\r\nThe root, consisting of a short horizontal rootstock bearing numerous\r\nsmall rootlets, may be harvested in the fall of the second or third\r\nyear. In preparing the root for market the stem and leaves are broken\r\noff and the dirt is removed by shaking (or washing, if necessary),\r\nafter which it is well dried. There are no available data on the\r\nprobable yield. The prewar prices paid to collectors for aletris\r\nusually ranged from 12 to 25 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920,\r\nwere about 70 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAconite (_Aconitum napellus_) is a hardy perennial, introduced from\r\nEurope and sparingly grown in this country as an ornamental garden\r\nplant. Both leaves and roots are very poisonous, the latter forming the\r\nofficial drug. Other varieties than _Aconitum napellus_ are also grown\r\nin flower gardens, and several species occur wild in the United States.\r\nSince the official species readily hybridizes with related varieties,\r\noften to the detriment of its medicinal properties, it is frequently\r\ndifficult to secure seed which will come true to name.\r\n\r\nAconite seems to thrive best in a rather cool climate and will grow in\r\nany rich garden soil, but a well-drained gravelly loam in an elevated\r\nsituation appears most suited for the cultivation of this plant. It\r\nmay be grown from seed sown in the open late in the fall or early in\r\nthe spring, or plants may be started in a seed bed and the seedlings\r\nlater transplanted and set about a foot apart in rows 2 feet apart. The\r\npreferable method of propagation is by division of the roots after the\r\nstems have died down in the fall, since thereby hybridization may be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe plants usually flower in the second year from seed, when the roots\r\nmay be harvested. It is preferable, however, to defer harvesting until\r\nthe stems have died down in the fall, when all the roots should be dug,\r\nthe smaller reserved for planting and the larger ones washed, sliced\r\nlengthwise, and dried. The leaves are also harvested, but are not in\r\nmuch demand.\r\n\r\nReliable data on yield are not available, although some estimates\r\nplace the yield at about 450 pounds of dry root per acre. The American\r\nmarket is supplied with imported aconite root, for which the prewar\r\nprice ranged from about 9 to 15 cents a pound. The price in June,\r\n1920, ranged from 60 to 62 cents a pound. The quantity imported in\r\n1919 was about 35,000 pounds. The demand for this drug is limited, and\r\nthis fact, together with the probable low yield, makes its profitable\r\ncultivation in this country very doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHAEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthaea, or marshmallow (_Althaea officinalis_), is a perennial herb\r\nintroduced from Europe which now grows wild in marshy places near\r\nthe sea in Massachusetts and along tidal rivers in New York and\r\nPennsylvania. The root forms the official drug, but the leaves and\r\nflowers also are sometimes used medicinally.\r\n\r\nAlthaea will grow well in almost any loose garden soil of moderate\r\nfertility, but tends to winterkill in situations where the ground\r\nfreezes to a considerable depth. The plants may be propagated from\r\nseeds or from divisions of the old roots made early in the spring.\r\nThe seed may be sown in the open in shallow drills at least 3 feet\r\napart, and the seedlings should be thinned to stand 16 inches apart in\r\nthe row. Under good conditions the plants attain a height of 3 or 4\r\nfeet; therefore, close planting does not give sufficient room for full\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of growth the roots are harvested, washed, peeled,\r\ncut into short lengths, and thoroughly dried. Yields at the rate of 800\r\nto 1,000 pounds of dry root per acre have been obtained. The prewar\r\nwholesale price usually ranged from 12 to 20 cents a pound. The price\r\nin June, 1920, was 25 to 27 cents a pound. The annual importation of\r\nthis root averages about 30,000 pounds. In view of the amount of hand\r\nlabor required in preparing the root, the relatively low price, and the\r\nrather limited demand, the cultivation of this plant for profit is not\r\nvery attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngelica (_Angelica officinalis_) is a European biennial plant of the\r\nparsley family, sometimes grown in this country as a culinary herb and\r\nknown commonly as garden angelica. The fresh stems and leafstalks are\r\nused as a garnish and for making a candied confection. The seeds and\r\nthe oil distilled from them are employed in flavoring, and the aromatic\r\nroots are sometimes used in medicine.\r\n\r\nAngelica thrives best in a moderately cool climate and may be grown in\r\nany good soil, although a deep, fairly rich loam which is moist but\r\nwell drained will give the best results. The soil should be deeply\r\nplowed and well prepared before planting. The plant is most readily\r\npropagated from divisions of old roots, which may be set either in the\r\nfall or spring about 18 inches apart in rows. The seeds germinate very\r\npoorly if more than one year old, and it is best to sow them as soon\r\nas they are ripe in a seed bed, which should be kept moist by frequent\r\nwatering if necessary. Early in the following spring the seedlings are\r\ntransplanted and set about 2 feet apart each way in their permanent\r\nlocation. Plants may also be obtained from seeds sown in March in\r\na spent hotbed or in a cold frame. In order to increase the root\r\ndevelopment, the plants are often transplanted a second time, at the\r\nend of the first year's growth, and set 3 or 4 feet apart. For the same\r\nreason the tops are often cut back to prevent the formation of seed.\r\nDuring the growing seasons the soil should be kept mellow and free from\r\nweeds by frequent cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe roots are usually harvested in the fall of the second year, but\r\nsometimes those of the first-year plants are marketed. After being dug,\r\nthe roots are washed and dried in the open air. In order to keep out\r\ninsects and to preserve the aroma it is best to store the dried root in\r\ntin containers which can be tightly closed. The root of the European\r\nor garden angelica found in our drug markets is imported largely from\r\nGermany. During the past few years the wholesale price has averaged\r\nabout 20 cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe root of a native species of angelica (_Angelica atropurpurea_),\r\ncommonly called American angelica, also occurs in the drug markets\r\nof this country. It is collected from wild plants, and the price to\r\ncollectors in former years usually ranged from 6 to 10 cents a pound.\r\nThe prices in June, 1920, were for the seed 20 cents and for the root\r\n14 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnise (_Pimpinella anisum_) is an annual herb of the parsley family,\r\nwidely cultivated in Europe and to a limited extent in this country,\r\nchiefly in Rhode Island. Although this plant may be grown quite\r\ngenerally throughout the United States, it has been found difficult to\r\nbring the crop to maturity in northerly situations where the growing\r\nseason is short or in the South where the climate is hot and dry.\r\nIt is grown chiefly for its aromatic seeds (fruits), which are used\r\nmedicinally, and also in baking and for flavoring confectionery. The\r\noil distilled from the seeds is used medicinally in cordials, and also\r\nfor flavoring various beverages.\r\n\r\nAnise thrives best in a light, moderately rich, and well-drained loam\r\nwhich has been carefully prepared before planting. It is grown from\r\nseeds, which are usually sown early in the spring directly in the\r\nfield, since the seedlings are unfavorably affected by transplanting.\r\nThe seeds, which should not be more than 2 years old, are sown thickly,\r\nabout two to the inch, and covered one-half inch deep. Since the plants\r\ndevelop very slowly, seed should not be sown in weedy soil. When the\r\nseedlings are 2 to 3 inches high they are thinned to stand 6 inches\r\napart in the row. The rows may be 18 inches or 3 feet apart, depending\r\non the cultivation intended. An ounce of seed should sow a row 150 feet\r\nlong, and about 5 pounds will plant an acre when the rows are 3 feet\r\napart. The plants should receive frequent and thorough cultivation\r\nthroughout the growing season.\r\n\r\nAbout three months from the time of planting the plants will blossom,\r\nand a month later the seed should be matured sufficiently for\r\nharvesting. As soon as the tips of the seeds turn a grayish green color\r\nthey should be harvested, for if allowed to remain exposed to the\r\nweather they quickly turn brown or blacken. The plants may be pulled by\r\nhand and stacked, tops inward, in heaps about 6 feet high, or they may\r\nbe mowed and at once built up into cocks of the same height. In about\r\nfour or five days the seed will have ripened, after which it should be\r\nthrashed out and thoroughly cleaned.\r\n\r\nYields of anise seed are quite variable, since the plant is very\r\nsensitive to unfavorable weather conditions. In a good season from 400\r\nto 600 pounds per acre may be reasonably expected. The prewar wholesale\r\nprice usually ranged from 6 to 8 cents a pound. The prices in June,\r\n1920, ranged from 19 to 30 cents a pound. During the war the average\r\nannual importation of 500 tons was reduced to about 180 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nArnica (_Arnica montana_) is a herbaceous perennial plant of the aster\r\nfamily, native in northern and central Europe, where it thrives in the\r\ncool climate of the mountain meadows and upland moors. The flowers,\r\nleaves, and roots are employed in medicine.\r\n\r\nArnica requires a marshy soil, abundant rainfall, and a cool climate\r\nfor its best development. It is propagated by divisions of the roots\r\nor from seeds sown either in the fall or the spring. Seed may also be\r\nsown in August in a seed bed and the plants transplanted the following\r\nspring to stand about 18 inches apart in the row. The flowers may be\r\nharvested the second year and the roots after three or four years.\r\n\r\nArnica is not produced commercially in the United States, and the small\r\nquantity imported annually is apparently sufficient to meet the market\r\ndemands. Its cultivation presents many difficulties, and efforts to\r\ngrow it in the milder portions of this country have generally proved\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLADONNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelladonna, or deadly nightshade (_Atropa belladonna_), is a large,\r\npoisonous perennial which occurs wild in Europe, where it is also\r\ncultivated. Both the leaves and the roots are important crude drugs. In\r\nrecent years it has been cultivated to some extent in this country, but\r\nis likely to winterkill in the colder sections.\r\n\r\nBelladonna may be propagated in a small way from cuttings of the young\r\nshoots rooted in moist sand in the usual manner or from divisions of\r\nthe fleshy rootstocks made early in the spring, but it is most readily\r\ngrown from seeds which may be thinly sown in pots or well-drained boxes\r\nin a cool greenhouse in midwinter or in a sheltered place in a garden\r\nearly in the spring. When the seedlings are large enough to handle they\r\nshould be transplanted singly to small pots or pricked out in flats or\r\nshallow boxes of light, rich soil, placing them about 2 inches apart\r\neach way, as with tomato or other vegetable plants intended for field\r\nplanting. In the spring, as soon as danger from frost is over, they\r\nshould be transplanted to the field and set about 20 inches apart in\r\nrows 30 or more inches apart Sowing seeds in the field or transplanting\r\ndirectly from the seed bed to the field has rarely given good results\r\nin this country. Belladonna seeds are small, and if well handled under\r\nglass or in protected seed beds 1 ounce should produce 10,000 or more\r\nplants, sufficient to set an acre.\r\n\r\nBelladonna thrives best in deep, moist, well-drained loam containing\r\nlime, such as will under proper fertilization produce good garden\r\nvegetables. The preparation of the soil should be very thorough\r\nand consists of deep plowing, either in the fall or early spring,\r\nand repeated working with the disk or spring-tooth and smoothing\r\nharrows. Weeds should be kept under control at all times and the\r\nsoil stirred with a hoe or cultivator at intervals of about 10 days,\r\nparticularly after each hard rain, and shallow cultivation given in\r\nhot, dry weather to conserve the natural moisture of the soil. Good\r\ncommercial fertilizers, such as are commonly used in truck gardens, are\r\nbeneficial. Those containing 8 per cent of phosphoric acid, 4 per cent\r\nof nitrogen, and 4 per cent of potash are the most desirable and should\r\nbe applied at the rate of about 600 pounds per acre. Stable manure at\r\nthe rate of 12 to 20 tons to the acre may be used if plowed under when\r\nthe ground is prepared.\r\n\r\nBelladonna is sometimes affected by a wilt disease, which is aggravated\r\nby wet soils and fresh animal manures, and the foliage is greedily\r\nattacked by the potato beetle. Dusting with lime, spot, or road dust\r\nin the morning when the leaves are wet with dew is occasionally\r\neffective. The destructive attacks of these pests are usually confined\r\nto the seed bed or to first-year plantings, but the insects may be\r\ncontrolled by the careful use of insecticides.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are picked when the plants are in full bloom. They should be\r\ncarefully handled, to avoid bruising, and dried in the shade in order\r\nto retain their green color. A hundred pounds of fresh leaves yield\r\nabout 18 pounds when well dried. One crop only can be collected the\r\nyear of planting, but two crops are gathered in each of the next two or\r\nthree years, after which it appears better to market the roots and make\r\nnew plantings. While only the leaves should be collected for the best\r\npharmaceutical trade, the young growth, including the smaller sappy\r\ntwigs, has medicinal value and may be sheared from the plants and dried\r\nin the same manner as the leaves. The ease of collection and increased\r\nweight of material may render the latter method more profitable.\r\n\r\nThe roots alone are not as profitable as the leaves. The best roots\r\nare those of the second and third year's growth. They are harvested in\r\nthe fall after frost, the tops being mowed and raked off and the roots\r\nturned out with a deep-running plow, or with a potato fork if the area\r\nbe small. They are carefully washed and cut into about 4-inch lengths,\r\nthe larger pieces being split lengthwise to aid in drying. Thorough\r\ndrying either in the sun or with mild artificial heat is essential;\r\notherwise, the roots will mold when stored.\r\n\r\nThe high prices paid for belladonna during the war greatly stimulated\r\nthe cultivation of this crop, which had previously been grown with some\r\nsuccess in California, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and\r\nsome other States. In 1918, 273 acres of belladonna were harvested,\r\nthe total production being about 83 tons of herb (including leaves and\r\nstems), an average of 600 pounds per acre. From 136 acres 11 tons of\r\nroot were harvested, an average of 164 pounds per acre. The marketing\r\nof this crop was followed by a decline in prices, the quotations in\r\nJune, 1920, being 30 to 35 cents a pound for the herb and 55 cents a\r\npound for the root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE FLAG.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlue flag (_Iris versicolor_) is a native perennial plant of common\r\noccurrence in swamps and marshy situations throughout the eastern half\r\nof the United States. The underground stem (rhizome) and roots are the\r\nparts of the plant used medicinally.\r\n\r\nBlue flag responds readily to cultivation when placed in a rich, moist,\r\nand rather heavy soil. It is readily propagated from divisions of old\r\nplants, which may be set 1 foot apart in rows spaced conveniently for\r\ncultivation. If the plants are set in August or September, the crop\r\nmay be harvested about, the last of October in the following year.\r\nThe roots may be turned out with a deep-running plow, and after being\r\nthoroughly washed and the larger clusters broken up they should be\r\nthoroughly dried. Artificial drying at low heat is usually desirable.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of 3 or 4 tons of dried root per acre have been\r\nobtained from small plats. The prewar price paid to collectors varied\r\nfrom year to year and usually ranged from 5 to 10 cents a pound. The\r\nprice in June, 1920, was 35 cents a pound. This crop does not appear to\r\nbe very promising, owing to the relatively small demand for the root\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONESET.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoneset (_Eupatorium perfoliatum_) is a hardy, rather long-lived\r\nperennial plant commonly found growing in low grounds throughout the\r\neastern half of the United States. The dried leaves and flowering tops\r\nform the official drug.\r\n\r\nDivisions of clumps of wild plants collected early in the fall will\r\nserve for propagation. These may be set about a foot apart in rows in\r\nwell-prepared soil. During the first winter the newly set divisions\r\nshould be protected with a light mulch of straw or manure. Plants may\r\nalso be grown from seeds, which should be collected as soon as ripe and\r\nsown in shallow drills about 8 inches apart in a rich, moist seed bed,\r\npreferably in partial shade. When of sufficient size they may be set in\r\nthe field at about the same distance as the divided clumps.\r\n\r\nThe plants are cut late in the summer when in full bloom and the\r\nleaves and flowering tops stripped from the stem by hand and carefully\r\ndried without exposure to the sun. Yields of well-cultivated boneset\r\nare quite large and 2,000 pounds or more per acre of dry herb may be\r\nobtained under favorable conditions. The prewar price for boneset\r\nrarely exceeded 2 to 3 cents a pound. The price in June, 1920, was 12\r\nto 13 cents a pound. Since the demand is limited and the wild supply\r\nfairly available, the cultivation of boneset does not offer much\r\nprospect of profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURDOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurdock (_Arctium lappa_) is a large biennial plant well known as a\r\ncommon and troublesome weed in the Eastern and Central States and in\r\nsome western localities. The dried root from plants of the first year's\r\ngrowth forms the official drug, but the seeds and leaves are also used\r\nmedicinally.\r\n\r\nBurdock will grow in almost any soil, but the best root development is\r\nfavored by a light well-drained soil rich in humus. The seeds germinate\r\nreadily and may be sown directly in the field, either late in the fall\r\nor early in the spring. The seed may be sown in drills 18 inches or 3\r\nfeet apart, as desired, and should be sown 1 inch deep if in the fall,\r\nbut less deeply if sown in the spring. When the seedlings are well\r\nup they should be thinned to stand about 6 inches apart in the row.\r\nCultivation should continue as long as the size of the plants will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nThe roots are harvested at the end of the first year's growth in order\r\nto secure the most acceptable drug and also to prevent the plants from\r\nbearing seed and spreading as a weed. The tops of the plants may be\r\ncut with a mower and raked off, after which the roots can usually be\r\nturned out with a deep-running plow or with a beet lifter. In a dry and\r\nvery sandy soil the roots frequently extend to a depth of 2 or 3 feet,\r\nmaking it necessary to dig them by hand. After digging, any remaining\r\ntops are removed and the roots are washed and dried, the drying being\r\npreferably by the use of low artificial heat. The roots are usually\r\nsplit lengthwise into two or more pieces in order to facilitate drying,\r\nalthough whole roots are marketable.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have\r\nbeen obtained. The prewar prices offered by dealers ranged from 4 to 6\r\ncents a pound. The prices for the root and seed in June, 1920, were 12\r\ncents a pound each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALAMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalamus, or sweet flag (_Acorus calamus_), is a native perennial\r\nplant, occurring frequently along streams and in the edges of swamps\r\nthroughout the eastern half of the United States. The dried root\r\n(rhizome or rootstock) is the part used as a drug.\r\n\r\nAlthough calamus in a wild state is usually found growing in water, it\r\nmay be cultivated in almost any good soil which is fairly moist. It\r\nusually does well on moderately dry upland soils which will produce\r\nfair crops of corn or potatoes. The plants are readily propagated from\r\ndivisions of old roots, which should be set early in the fall 1 foot\r\napart in rows and well covered. During the following growing season\r\nthe plants should receive frequent and thorough cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe roots are harvested in the fall and may be readily dug with a spade\r\nor turned out with a plow. The tops, together with about an inch of the\r\nrootstock, are next cut off and used to make new plantings. The roots\r\nare washed and dried artificially at a moderately low degree of heat.\r\nThe marketable product consists of the thick rootstocks deprived of\r\ntheir small rootlets often called \"fibers.\" These may be removed before\r\ndrying, but more easily afterwards, since when dry and brittle they\r\nbreak off readily with a little handling. Roots thus treated are often\r\ncalled \"stripped\" and are more aromatic than those which have been\r\npeeled.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have been\r\nobtained. The prewar price for the unpeeled root usually ranged from\r\n3 to 5 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were 10 to 12 cents a\r\npound. The annual importation of calamus root ranges from 5 to 10 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALENDULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalendula, or pot marigold (_Calendula officinalis_), is a hardy annual\r\nplant native to southern Europe, but frequently grown in flower gardens\r\nin this country. The dried flower heads are sometimes used in soups\r\nand stews, and the so-called petals (ligulate florets) are employed in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nCalendula grows well on a variety of soils, but a moderately rich\r\ngarden loam will give the best results. The seed may be sown in open\r\nground early in the spring in drills 18 inches apart. As soon as the\r\nseedlings are well established they should be thinned to stand about\r\na foot apart in the row. In the North it is desirable to sow the seed\r\nabout the first of April in coldframes or spent hotbeds and transplant\r\nthe young seedlings as soon as the danger of frost is past.\r\n\r\nThe plants blossom early and continue to bloom throughout the summer.\r\nThe flowers are gathered at intervals of a few days and carefully\r\ndried. The petals (florets) which form the drug may be removed either\r\nbefore or after the flower heads are dried. The petals are removed by\r\nhand, but this process requires so much time that when the cost of the\r\nnecessary labor is taken into account it is doubtful whether the price\r\nreceived for the drug would cover the cost of production.\r\n\r\nThe dried whole flowers produced in this country were quoted in the\r\nwholesale markets in June, 1920, at 25 cents to $1 a pound, according\r\nto quality; the petals, at $1.95 to $2.10 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMOMILE, GERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman camomile (_Matricaria chamomilla_) is a European annual herb of\r\nthe aster family, cultivated in this country in gardens, from which\r\nit has escaped in some localities. The dried flower heads are used in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nThis species of camomile does well on moderately heavy soil which is\r\nrich in humus and rather moist. Since the plants bloom about eight\r\nweeks after sowing the seed, a crop of camomile may be grown from seed\r\nsown either early in the spring or late in the summer, following early\r\nvegetable crops. The seed may be sown in drills and barely covered or\r\nmay be broadcast, since the plants will soon occupy the ground and\r\nexclude the weeds. When the plants are In full bloom the flower heads\r\nare gathered and may be spread thinly on canvas sheets and dried in\r\nthe sun. All leaves and stems should be removed, and when the flowers\r\nare thoroughly dry they should be packed for market in boxes or bales\r\nrather than in bags, since in the latter the flowers are likely to be\r\nbadly broken in handling.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 400\r\npounds of dry flowers per acre may be expected under favorable\r\nconditions. Prewar wholesale prices usually ranged from about 15 to 40\r\ncents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were 41 to 43 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMOMILE, ROMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoman camomile (also called English camomile, _Anthemis nobilis_) is a\r\nEuropean perennial herb of the aster family, frequently cultivated in\r\ngardens in this country and sometimes found growing wild. In America,\r\ncamomile is grown chiefly as an ornamental plant, especially for use in\r\nborders, since the plants blossom from midsummer until killed by frost.\r\nThe dried flower heads from cultivated plants are used in medicine.\r\n\r\nCamomile grows well in almost any good, rather dry soil which has full\r\nexposure to the sun. The plants may be grown from seeds or propagated\r\nby dividing the roots early in the spring. The divisions of the root\r\nmay be planted 9 inches apart in rows spaced according to the method of\r\ncultivation to be used. When planted on a small scale the divisions,\r\nor offsets, may be set 9 inches apart each way in carefully prepared\r\nsoil. Hand weeding is necessary, but since the plants soon spread and\r\nfully shade the ground, weeds usually have small chance of becoming\r\ntroublesome.\r\n\r\nThe flower heads are gathered just as they open, either by hand or by\r\nmeans of a flower picker, and are dried in the open in bright weather\r\nor, when necessary, on canvas trays in a heated room. Rapid drying\r\nis essential, as it is desirable to retain the white color as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe yield is variable, but from 400 to 600 pounds of dried flowers\r\nper acre may be expected. The prices for Roman camomile quoted in the\r\nwholesale drug markets of this country prior to the war usually ranged\r\nfrom about 10 to 12 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were 18\r\nto 20 cents a pound. Since this crop requires much hand labor, its\r\ncultivation in this country on a commercial scale does not promise to\r\nbe very profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camphor tree (_Camphora officinalis_) is a large evergreen, native\r\nto Asia. It is hardy in situations where the winter temperature\r\ndoes not fall below 15° F., and for many years has been grown as an\r\nornamental in the southern and southwestern United States. Young trees\r\nsuitable for planting as ornamentals may usually be obtained from the\r\nnurseries in Florida and other parts of the South, or they can be\r\neasily grown from fresh seed.\r\n\r\nFor culture on a commercial scale the climatic requirements of camphor\r\nare practically the same as those of citrus fruits. The tree can\r\nbe grown in almost any soil, but the maximum growth is secured in\r\nsoils which are rich and well drained. When planted for commercial\r\ncultivation new land is preferable. The following statements are based\r\nupon actual experiments and observations on the growing and production\r\nof camphor under conditions found in Florida.\r\n\r\nCamphor seeds ripen about the middle of October and should be planted\r\nwhile fresh, a better germination being obtained when the pulp is\r\nremoved. The seed bed should be selected with care and the precaution\r\ntaken to have one that will give sufficient moisture during the dry\r\nseason and yet be well drained. For small seed beds of 2 or 3 acres or\r\nless it may be practicable to provide irrigation. Excellent stands of\r\nseedlings have been obtained on slightly rolling land which originally\r\nwas covered with \"blackjack\" oak.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of September, or somewhat earlier if conditions permit,\r\nthe land should be well plowed and thoroughly worked down with a disk\r\nharrow. Just before the seeds are planted it should again be worked\r\nover and all roots of Bermuda grass or other weeds removed, since\r\nrapidly growing grasses or weeds will absorb so much moisture from the\r\nsoil that the seeds can not germinate.\r\n\r\nThe seeds begin to ripen during the first part of October and are\r\nusually in a fairly well ripened stage by the last of that month. From\r\nthis time until the heavy frosts they can be gathered and planted\r\nwith safety. Seeds gathered after heavy frosts have been planted\r\nsuccessfully, but it is not advisable to take the risk of too hard\r\na freeze. In determining the time to gather seed a simple test is\r\nsufficient. Seeds that fall into the hand when the cluster is slightly\r\ntwisted are ripe enough to plant.\r\n\r\nIn planting, a cotton-dropping machine, modified somewhat to meet the\r\nnew requirements, may be used. The machine is set to plant the seeds 2\r\nor 3 inches apart and cover them 1 inch deep in rows far enough apart\r\nto permit horse cultivation. The plants begin to come up in about three\r\nmonths, but four or five months are often required for a full stand.\r\nAs soon as the plants can be distinguished in the rows cultivation is\r\nbegun, which at first is done by hand with either a wheel or hand hoe.\r\nLater, as the plants attain size, a horse cultivator can be used, but a\r\ncertain amount of handwork is necessary throughout the time the plants\r\nremain in the seed bed. When the plants are well started they should\r\nreceive a good application of sheep or goat manure or of high-grade\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe first season a growth of from 3 to 18 inches may be expected,\r\nthe irregularity of development depending on the vitality of the\r\nseed, variation in the soil, and numerous other factors. The plants\r\nare allowed to grow in the seed bed usually for a year and are then\r\ntransplanted to the field. In transplanting it is customary to separate\r\nthe plants into two grades, \"sturdy\" and \"weak,\" planting each grade\r\nin a field by itself. By doing this the replanting is simplified,\r\nsince the sturdy stock requires but few trees for replanting and the\r\nweak stock, which will require considerable replanting, is all in one\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nPrevious to transplanting, the land is well prepared by deep plowing\r\nand thorough harrowing, and rows are laid off 15 feet apart. The young\r\ntrees are set in these rows 4 feet apart, either by hand or with a\r\ntree-setting machine. This machine is simply a tobacco-setting machine\r\nfitted with a trench opener set to open a furrow 8 inches deep, in\r\nwhich the trees are placed. The trees used for transplanting are\r\nheaded back to within 1 inch of the crown, and the lower end of the\r\ntaproot and all large laterals are removed. The taproot of the tree\r\nas planted is thus reduced in length to 8 or 10 inches and varies in\r\ndiameter according to the vitality and previous growth of the seedling.\r\nTransplanting should be done in the winter months, when the trees are\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nCultivation is begun as soon as the trees put forth shoots in the\r\nspring and continued until the rainy season of each year. After the\r\nrainy season the plants are again cultivated and all grass and weeds\r\nremoved. At times cultivation is necessary during the rainy season\r\nin order to keep the trees from becoming smothered and killed by the\r\nfast-growing weeds. One-horse cultivators drawn by mules or a gang\r\ncultivator drawn by a light tractor may be used.\r\n\r\nIn three or four years, after transplanting, the trees should be from 7\r\nto 8 feet high. They are then trimmed by means of a special machine[3]\r\nto form an =A=-shaped hedge and the trimmings distilled for the oil\r\nand camphor gum. Trimming is carried on when the trees are in the\r\ndormant stage, which is twice each year, usually November to January\r\nand May to June. The summer dormant season is somewhat irregular and\r\ngoverned entirely by local conditions.\r\n\r\n[3] A detailed description of this machine is given in U. S. Dept. of\r\nAgr. Cir. 78, entitled \"A Machine for Trimming Camphor Trees.\" 1920.\r\n\r\nThe cuttings are hauled from the field to the distilling plant, and if\r\nmany large branches are present they are run through a heavy ensilage\r\ncutter. For distillation they are packed in large iron retorts, to\r\nwhich steam is admitted at the bottom. The outlet pipe of the retort is\r\nconnected with a specially constructed condensing apparatus in which\r\nthe oil and camphor carried over by the steam are condensed and partly\r\ncollected. Portions of oil and camphor not collected in the condenser\r\nare caught in a tub fitted with an outlet siphon which carries away the\r\nexcess condensed steam but leaves the oil and camphor behind.\r\n\r\nWhen removed from the condenser the product is very crude, consisting\r\nof a mixture of oil, water, and camphor. This mixture is either thrown\r\ninto a centrifuge and the oil and water removed or it is placed in\r\nlarge cylindrical vats and the oil and water allowed to drain out. The\r\noil is then separated from the water by means of a siphon. The camphor\r\nand oil are marketed separately.\r\n\r\nThe annual yield of cuttings has varied from 2 to 5 tons per acre,\r\nwhich should give approximately 40 to 100 pounds of marketable camphor.\r\nAt present the planting of small areas does not seem advisable, in\r\nview of the heavy outlay required for the machinery necessary to\r\nproduce camphor gum at a profit. An area of less than 500 acres would\r\nprobably not warrant the installation of the machinery necessary for\r\nthe commercial production of camphor, and 1,000 acres or more will\r\ndoubtless give a greater net return per acre. Although the crop is\r\na low-priced one, under favorable conditions it is estimated that a\r\nfair return per acre may be expected, but the data so far accumulated\r\nare not sufficient to warrant specific statements concerning the\r\nprofitableness of the industry.\r\n\r\nCamphor oil, or the oil from which camphor has been removed, is used\r\nin Japan for illuminating purposes, and as a solvent for resins in the\r\nmanufacture of lacquer. It is used in Europe for its safrol content,\r\nand may probably be utilized for the same purpose in this country.\r\nThere exists already in the American market a demand for the Japanese\r\noil at prices ranging from 11 to 14 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nCamphor imports into the United States usually exceed 3,000,000 pounds\r\nannually; hence, it does not seem probable that there is any danger of\r\noverproduction in the Southern States. However, it is possible that at\r\ntimes camphor may be imported at a price so low as to render production\r\nin this country financially unprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNABIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drug cannabis or Indian hemp (_Cannabis sativa_), consists of\r\nthe dried flowering tops of the female plants. It grows well over a\r\nconsiderable portion of the United States, but the production of the\r\nactive principle of this plant is believed to be favored by a warm\r\nclimate. For drug purposes, therefore, this crop appears to be adapted\r\nto the Southern rather than to the Northern States.\r\n\r\nCannabis is propagated from seeds, which should be planted in the\r\nspring as soon as conditions are suitable, in well-prepared sandy of\r\nclayey loam at a depth of about an inch in rows 5 or 6 feet apart. The\r\nseeds may be dropped every two or three inches in the row or planted in\r\nhills about a foot apart in the row, 6 to 10 seeds being dropped into\r\neach hill. Two or three pounds of seed per acre should give a good\r\nstand. About half the seeds will produce male plants, which must be\r\nremoved before their flowers mature; otherwise, the female plants will\r\nset seed, thereby diminishing their value as a drug. The male plants\r\ncan be recognized with certainty only by the presence of stamens in\r\ntheir flowers.\r\n\r\nOrdinary stable or barnyard manure plowed in deeply is better for use\r\nas a fertilizer than commercial preparations and may be safely applied\r\nat the rate of 20 tons per acre. However, good results may be obtained\r\nwith commercial fertilizers, such as are used for truck crops and\r\npotatoes, when cultivated in between the rows at the rate of 500 or 600\r\npounds per acre.\r\n\r\nWhen the female plants reach maturity, a sticky resin forms on the\r\nheavy, compact flower clusters, and harvesting may then be begun. The\r\ntops of the plants comprising the flower clusters are cut and carefully\r\ndried in the shade to preserve the green color as far as possible.\r\nDrying can best be done, especially in damp weather, by the use of\r\nartificial heat, not to exceed 140° F.\r\n\r\nFor several years cannabis of standard (U. S. P.) quality has been\r\ngrown on a commercial scale in this country, chiefly in South Carolina\r\nand Virginia. After the flowering tops are harvested they are\r\nthoroughly dried under cover, then worked over by hand, and all the\r\nstems and large foliage leaves removed. This process gives a drug of\r\nhigh quality but greatly reduces the net or marketable yield per acre,\r\nwhich usually ranges from 350 to 400 pounds. Some growers do not remove\r\nthe stems and leaves, thus increasing the acreage yield but reducing\r\nthe market value of their product. The quality of cannabis can be\r\ndetermined only by special laboratory tests, which most dealers are\r\nnot equipped to make; consequently, they are usually unwilling to pay\r\ngrowers as high prices as they would if the low-grade cannabis were\r\nkept off the market.\r\n\r\nThe market price in June, 1920, for tested (U. S. P.) domestic cannabis\r\nwas 30 to 35 cents; for nontested, 20 to 25 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARAWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaraway (_Carum carvi_) is a European biennial herb of the parsley\r\nfamily. It grows and fruits well over a considerable portion of\r\nthe United States, especially in the North and Northwest, but its\r\ncultivation in this country seems never to have assumed commercial\r\nproportions. The seeds are used medicinally, but are mainly utilized\r\nfor flavoring cakes, confectionery, and similar products. On\r\ndistillation with steam, the seeds yield an aromatic oil, which is more\r\nused in medicine than the seed itself.\r\n\r\nSoil of a somewhat clayey nature and containing a fair proportion of\r\nhumus and available plant food is particularly suited to caraway, but\r\nthe plant generally grows well in any good upland soil which will\r\nproduce fair crops of corn or potatoes. Seeds should be sown in early\r\nspring in drills about 16 inches apart, and from 6 to 8 pounds of seed\r\nare sown to the acre. Frequent shallow cultivation throughout both\r\ngrowing seasons is desirable in order to keep the soil mellow and free\r\nfrom weeds, as a weedy crop at harvest time usually means a product\r\ninferior in quality.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the oldest seeds ripen, which is usually in June of the\r\nsecond year, the crop should be harvested. The plants may be cut with\r\na mower and should be left in the swath until they have lost most of\r\ntheir moisture, when they may be built up into small cocks, or they may\r\nbe brought in from the field and the curing finished in a barn loft.\r\nIf on handling in the field the seeds shatter extensively, the crop\r\nshould be brought in in tight wagons. When drying is finished the seeds\r\nare thrashed out, cleaned, and stored in bags which contain about 100\r\npounds each.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about\r\n1,000 pounds of seed per acre may be expected. One hundred pounds\r\nof seed will usually yield 4 to 6 pounds of oil. The average annual\r\nimportation of caraway seed for several years has been about 2,000,000\r\npounds, valued at about 9 cents a pound. The war reduced the annual\r\nimportations of oil of caraway from 30,000 to 9,000 pounds and\r\nincreased the value from 80 cents to about $4.25 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASCARA SAGRADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCascara, or cascara sagrada (_Rhamnus purshiana_), is a small tree 20\r\nto 30 feet high, native to the Western part of the United States, and\r\nfound most abundantly in a narrow belt along the Pacific slope from\r\nnorthern California to southern British Columbia. The bark from the\r\ntrunk and branches is the source of the drug, for which there is a\r\nconstant and steady demand.\r\n\r\nPlantings which have been made in the Eastern States indicate that this\r\ntree may probably be grown along the Atlantic slope in the Piedmont or\r\nfoothill belt from Pennsylvania to Georgia. The trees have been found\r\nto grow better in clay loam than in either sand or clay. Propagation\r\nfrom seed is easy, but the seeds should be planted in the fall soon\r\nafter they ripen or stratified in sand until used, since germination is\r\nvery poor if the seeds are allowed to become dry. The seeds are sown\r\nin a seed bed under shade in drills 8 inches apart and covered about 1\r\ninch deep. The seedlings reach a height of 10 to 15 inches the first\r\nyear, and in the following spring before the leaves appear they are\r\nset in the field 6 feet apart each way. It is advisable to cultivate\r\nfrequently, in order to keep the weeds down and to maintain a shallow\r\nsurface mulch.\r\n\r\nIf the trees are pruned properly, a crop of bark may be harvested each\r\nyear without killing the whole tree, as is done in collecting the bark\r\nfrom wild trees. At the time of transplanting, the trees are cut back\r\nto a straight stem about a foot high, from which all except the four\r\nuppermost buds are removed. The branches which afterwards develop\r\nfrom these buds are later deprived of their lower side shoots, thus\r\ncausing the tree to grow a head of four long, stout branches instead\r\nof a single straight trunk. When the trees are large enough to yield a\r\ncrop of bark, the longest of the four branches is cut off early in the\r\nspring flush with the trunk and a new branch is allowed to grow in its\r\nplace. This process may be repeated yearly, removing only the largest\r\nbranches of each tree in any one season.\r\n\r\nThe bark on the cut-off branches is divided with a sharp knife into\r\nlengthwise strips of about an inch or two in width, which may be\r\nreadily pulled off. It is then dried carefully at a low temperature\r\nin the shade and broken into small pieces to facilitate packing and\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\nThe price paid to collectors for cascara bark, which before the war\r\nusually varied from 1 to 4 cents a pound, in June, 1920, was about 10\r\ncents a pound. So long as a supply of the wild bark continues to be\r\navailable it is doubtful whether cascara can be cultivated at a profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR BEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castor-oil plant or Palma Christi (_Ricinus communis_) is a robust\r\nperennial in tropical countries which becomes an annual in regions\r\nsubject to frost. The seeds of this plant, called \"castor beans\" or\r\n\"mole beans,\" yield the castor oil of commerce. Between 1860 and 1900,\r\nthe castor bean was an important crop in certain sections of Oklahoma,\r\nKansas, Missouri, and Illinois, but during recent years its culture has\r\nbeen practically abandoned in favor of crops which are easier to handle\r\nand more profitable.\r\n\r\nFor the commercial production of castor beans a warm climate and long\r\ngrowing season are necessary. If planted much farther north than St.\r\nLouis, Mo., or Washington, D. C, the crop is very likely to be caught\r\nby frost. In general, any fertile soil which produces good crops of\r\ncotton or corn is suitable for castor beans, but a very fertile soil\r\nfavors the growth of the plant at the expense of seed production\r\nand early maturity. The land is prepared in much the same manner\r\nas for cotton or corn; that is, plowed, disked, and harrowed level\r\nbefore planting, which may be done by hand or with a corn planter\r\nwith specially prepared plates. The seed should be planted early in\r\nthe spring, as soon as the soil is warm but still moderately moist.\r\nThe time of planting varies according to locality, but in general\r\ncorresponds to that of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe seed is planted in hills at a depth of 1 to 2 inches. Toward the\r\nnorth, the rows are usually made 4 feet apart and the hills spaced 3\r\nfeet apart in the row. Farther south the rows should usually be made\r\nabout 6 to 8 feet apart. On very light land the hills may be 4 feet\r\napart in the row; on heavier land, 6 to 8 feet apart. As a general\r\nrule three seeds are planted to the hill, and not less than two should\r\nbe planted. One bushel of medium-sized seed should plant from 5 to 6\r\nacres. When the plants are from 4 to 6 inches tall, the weaker ones\r\nshould be removed, leaving one plant in a hill.\r\n\r\nThe crop is cultivated similar to corn until the plants are large\r\nenough to shade the ground. In case the field becomes foul with\r\nweeds and grass, some hoeing may be necessary, but practically all\r\nthe cultivation required can be done with a horse-drawn weeder. Some\r\nvarieties in which the beans pop out when the hull is fully ripe are\r\nknown locally as \"poppers,\" and after the beans begin to ripen, the\r\nfield must be gone over every few days and the ripe beans collected in\r\norder to avoid loss. Other varieties tend to retain the beans in the\r\nhull after they are ripe. The climate affects the popping of the beans,\r\nand a variety which shatters badly in one region may shatter very\r\nlittle when grown in another.\r\n\r\nIn harvesting, a common method is to cut off the spikes with a knife\r\nand collect them in large sacks. They are then hauled to a shelter of\r\nsome kind and allowed to dry until the pods will crush easily. Various\r\nmethods are used in thrashing castor beans. If the variety grown is\r\none which \"pops\" or drops its seeds when they are ripe, the spikes are\r\nsometimes piled on a hard ground or plank floor fully exposed to the\r\nsun and furnished with sides of boards or cloth 6 to 8 feet high to\r\ncatch the beans as they pop out. In some varieties mere drying does\r\nnot cause the pods to open, and specially constructed machines have\r\nbeen used to remove the beans from the pods. After the beans have been\r\nthrashed or popped out, a fanning mill is used to separate the hulls,\r\nchaff, and dirt from the beans, which are then sacked and stored for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe yield varies greatly and will depend much upon cultural conditions,\r\nthe season, the variety grown, and the care exercised in harvesting\r\nand thrashing the seeds. In Oklahoma the average yield of the popping\r\nvarieties is said to be 8 to 10 bushels per acre. Yields up to 25\r\nbushels per acre have been reported for favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nFor some years prior to the war the farm price for castor beans was\r\nabout $1 a bushel. Early in the war the increased demand for castor oil\r\ncaused a sharp advance in the price of the beans, which has gradually\r\ndeclined. In June, 1920, the wholesale market quotation was about $3 a\r\nbushel. The normal market requirement in the United States for castor\r\nbeans is about 1,000,000 bushels annually, but during the last year of\r\nthe war nearly 3,000,000 bushels were imported.\r\n\r\nIn the United States castor beans are used in quantity only by\r\nmanufacturers of castor oil. In general, the equipment and operation\r\nof a castor-oil mill resembles that of a cottonseed-oil mill or\r\nlinseed-oil mill, but special and expensive equipment is necessary for\r\nthe proper extraction of the oil from castor beans. The best grade of\r\noil is obtained from the beans by hydraulic pressure. An additional\r\nquantity of oil of lower grade is obtained by treating the press cake\r\nwith naphtha or some other volatile solvent. The pomace resulting from\r\nthe second extraction is used as a fertilizer for tobacco, corn, and\r\nother crops, but because of a poisonous principle can not be used for\r\ncattle feeding unless specially treated.\r\n\r\nOwing to the heavy outlay required for the necessary machinery and\r\nthe high cost of manufacture on a small scale, it has not been found\r\nprofitable for the growers of castor beans to undertake the extraction\r\nof the oil.\r\n\r\nThe castor-oil plant is not known to be poisonous, and although the\r\nleaves are not relished by farm animals they are said to be used as\r\nfodder for cattle in India. Castor beans, however, contain a poisonous\r\nprinciple, and though harmless when handled, may cause serious if not\r\nfatal effects when eaten, especially in the case of small children.\r\nCare should be taken to prevent these beans from being accidentally\r\nmixed with the grain fed to animals, since many cases have been\r\nreported in which the death of horses has been due to eating feed in\r\nwhich they have become mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATNIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatnip (_Nepeta cataria_) is a European perennial plant of the mint\r\nfamily, which frequently occurs in this country as a weed in gardens\r\nand about dwellings. It has long had a popular use as a domestic\r\nremedy. Both leaves and flowering tops find some demand in the\r\ncrude-drug trade.\r\n\r\nCatnip does well on almost any good soil, but thrives best on a\r\nwell-drained and moderately rich garden loam. However, a more fragrant\r\nand attractive herb can be grown in sandy situations than in heavy\r\nsoils. The plant may be propagated from seeds or by root division. The\r\nseed may be sown in rows either late in the fall or in early spring\r\nand covered lightly. Fall-sown seed usually gives a more even stand\r\nand a heavier growth of herb. When the plants have reached a height\r\nof 4 to 5 inches they should be thinned to stand from 12 to 16 inches\r\napart in the rows. In some localities the field sowing of seed does not\r\ngive good results, in which case plants may be started in a coldframe\r\nand later transplanted to the field. Shallow cultivation will favor a\r\nvigorous growth of the herb.\r\n\r\nThe flowering tops are harvested when the plants are in full bloom\r\nand are dried in the shade to preserve their green color. In case the\r\nherb is grown in large quantity, it may be cut with a mowing machine,\r\nthe cutter bar of which should be set high. The plants should lie in\r\nthe swath until partially dry, and the curing may then be finished\r\neither in small cocks in the field or in the barn, care being taken to\r\npreserve the natural green color as far as possible.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 2,000\r\npounds of dried flowering tops per acre may be expected under good\r\nconditions. The herb must be carefully sorted and all the large or\r\ncoarse stems removed, after which it may be made up for the market in\r\nbales of 100 to 300 pounds each. Prewar prices to collectors ranged\r\nfrom 2 to 4 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, for the herb were\r\n5 cents; for the leaves, 10 cents; and for the leaves and flowers, 14\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMOMILE. (See CAMOMILE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nConium, or poison hemlock (_Conium maculatum_), is a large, poisonous\r\nEuropean biennial plant of the parsley family, naturalized in the\r\nNortheastern States and in California. The full-grown but unripe seeds\r\n(fruits) and the leaves are used medicinally.\r\n\r\nConium is easily grown, and has been found to thrive in both\r\ncomparatively moist clay soil and in dry sandy loam. In rich, moist\r\nland it may easily become a troublesome weed. Conium grows readily\r\nfrom seed, which may be sown either in the fall or early in the spring\r\nin drills 2 or more feet apart. As soon as the seedlings can be\r\ndistinguished in the row, cultivation similar to that given ordinary\r\ngarden crops is begun. The plants usually blossom in the second year,\r\nand when the oldest seeds are full grown but still green in color the\r\nplants are harvested and the seed at once thrashed out and dried with\r\nthe least possible exposure to the light. The small and undeveloped\r\nseed should be screened out and rejected and the good seed stored in\r\ncontainers that will exclude light and air. The leaves are collected\r\nwhen the plant is in flower, quickly dried in the sun, and stored in\r\nthe same manner as the seed.\r\n\r\nEstimated yields at the rate of 600 to 800 pounds of seed per acre have\r\nbeen obtained, but the yield is very uncertain, since the flowering\r\nplants are especially subject to the attacks of insects which destroy\r\nthe crop of seed. The prewar prices as quoted in the wholesale drug\r\nmarkets ranged from 5 to 10 cents a pound for the seed and 5 to 6 cents\r\nfor the leaves. The prices in June, 1920, for the seed were 35 to 36\r\ncents, and for the leaves 25 to 26 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORIANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoriander (_Coriandrum sativum_) is an Old World annual of the parsley\r\nfamily. For years the plant has been cultivated in gardens in the\r\nUnited States, and it is now reported as growing wild in many places.\r\nThe aromatic seeds and the oil distilled from them have long been used\r\nmedicinally. Both the seed and the oil are also used for flavoring\r\nconfectionery and cordials and as a condiment in bread and cake.\r\n\r\nCoriander grows well on almost any good soil, but thrives best on\r\ndeep and fertile garden loam. The soil should be well prepared before\r\nplanting, which should be done moderately early in the spring. For\r\nfield cultivation the seed is sown in rows 3 feet apart, but if the\r\ncultivation is done by hand the distance between the rows may be\r\nreduced to 18 inches. The seed should be sown thickly in order to\r\ninsure a good stand. When well up, the plants are thinned to stand 4 or\r\n5 inches apart in the row. Cultivation should continue until the plants\r\nflower, which will be about two months from the time of planting.\r\n\r\nWhen most of the seeds are ripe the plants are cut with a scythe or\r\nmower, preferably early in the morning while moist with dew, in order\r\nto avoid shattering the seed. The plants are partially cured in small\r\ncocks in the field, the drying being finished in a barn loft or under\r\nother suitable shelter, after which the seeds are thrashed out and\r\ncleaned.\r\n\r\nThe yield of seed is quite variable, but returns from experimental\r\nareas indicate that from 500 to 800 pounds per acre may be expected.\r\nFive hundred pounds of seed will usually yield from 1 to 5 pounds of\r\noil, according to the localities where grown. The annual importation of\r\ncoriander seed is about 1,400,000 pounds. The prewar price of the seed\r\nwas about 3 cents a pound; in June, 1920, 3 to 4 cents. The wholesale\r\nprice of the oil of coriander, which was $5 to $7 a pound before the\r\nwar, in June, 1920, ranged from $42 to $45 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANDELION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDandelion (_Taraxacum officinale_) is a well-known and troublesome\r\nperennial weed, occurring abundantly almost everywhere in this country\r\nexcept in the Southern States. It is frequently cultivated in market\r\ngardens for the leaves, which are used for greens or salads, but the\r\nroot alone is used in medicine.\r\n\r\nThis plant will grow well in any good soil and has been successfully\r\ncultivated in the South, but in the colder parts of the country it may\r\nrequire slight mulching during the winter if the roots tend to heave\r\nout of the soil. The seeds, which are sown in the spring, are drilled\r\nin rows 18 inches apart and covered one-half inch deep. About 3 pounds\r\nof seeds should sow an acre. The seedlings are thinned to stand a foot\r\napart in the row, and the crop should be well cultivated and kept free\r\nfrom weeds.\r\n\r\nThe roots are dug in the fall of the second season after planting the\r\nseed. They should be washed and may be dried whole, or, to facilitate\r\nhandling and drying, they may be cut into pierces 3 to 6 inches long\r\nand the larger, portions sliced. Under favorable conditions, yields\r\nat the rate of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds of dry roots per acre have been\r\nobtained from second-year plants. The prices usually offered collectors\r\nfor the dry root before the war ranged from 4 to 10 cents a pound. The\r\nprice in June, 1920, was about 16 cents. The quantity annually imported\r\ninto this country varies from year to year, but averages about 40 tons.\r\n\r\nA serious disadvantage attending the cultivation of this crop is the\r\ndanger of seeding adjacent land with a very undesirable weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigitalis, or foxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_), is a fairly hardy\r\nEuropean perennial, which has long been grown in flower gardens in this\r\ncountry as an ornamental plant. The leaves are used in medicine, those\r\nfrom plants of the second year's growth being required for the official\r\ndrug.\r\n\r\nDigitalis thrives in ordinary well-drained garden soils of open texture\r\nand reasonable fertility. Sowing the seed directly in the field\r\noccasionally gives good results, but is so often unsuccessful that it\r\ncan not be recommended. The seeds are exceedingly small and do not\r\ngerminate well except under the most favorable conditions. They should\r\nbe mixed with sand, to insure even distribution in seeding, and sown\r\nas early as February in seed pans or flats in the greenhouses or in\r\nwell-protected frames. When danger of frost is past the plants should\r\nbe hardened off and transplanted to the field, where they may be set\r\nabout a foot apart in rows spaced conveniently for cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe plants do not flower until the second year, and it is necessary to\r\ncultivate them frequently during the growing seasons of both the first\r\nand second year. In localities where the cold weather is severe it may\r\nbe desirable to protect the plants during the first winter with a light\r\nmulch of straw or coarse farmyard manure.\r\n\r\nThe plants usually flower in June of the second year, and the leaves\r\nmay then be collected. They are carefully dried in the shade and should\r\nbe stored in such a manner that they will not be exposed to light\r\nand moisture. The results of experiments indicate that yields of 450\r\nto 600 pounds of dry leaves per acre may be obtained under favorable\r\nconditions. In considering digitalis culture it should be borne in\r\nmind that the crop occupies the soil for the greater part of two\r\nseasons and demands even closer attention than many truck or garden\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 small areas of cultivated digitalis, ranging from one-half\r\nto 1 acre in extent, were harvested in Pennsylvania, South Carolina,\r\nWashington, California, and some other States. Several tons of\r\ndigitalis leaves were also collected from plants of wild growth in the\r\ngeneral region of the Coast Range of mountains on the Pacific coast.\r\nDigitalis is of great medicinal importance, but on account of its\r\npotency is administered in very small quantities; consequently, a few\r\nthousand pounds is sufficient to meet the annual market requirements.\r\nBefore the war the price for digitalis leaves averaged about 15 cents a\r\npound; in June, 1920, it was about 35 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDill (_Anethum graveolens_) is an Old World annual or biennial herb of\r\nthe parsley family. Although it is a native of southern Europe, it is\r\nhardy plant and may be grown in a much cooler climate if given a warm\r\nsituation and a well-drained soil. The leaves are used for seasoning,\r\nand the seeds (fruits), which are greatly valued for flavoring pickles,\r\nare used as a condiment and occasionally in medicine. A volatile oil\r\ndistilled from the seeds is used chiefly for perfuming soap.\r\n\r\nDill is preferably grown as an annual plant, in which case the seed\r\nshould be sown about one-half inch deep very early in the spring in\r\ndrills a foot apart. A half ounce of seed is sufficient to sow 150 feet\r\nof drill, and at this rate a pound should sow an acre. When sown in the\r\nfield the rows may be 15 to 18 inches apart, and the seedlings should\r\nbe thinned to stand about a foot apart in the row. The most favorable\r\nsoil is a well-prepared loam, but the plants grow well in any good\r\ngarden soil. Frequent cultivation and freedom from weeds are essential\r\nfor good results.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fall, as soon as some of the older seeds are ripe, the\r\nplants are mowed and built up; into small cocks in the field, or, if\r\nsufficiently dry, the seeds may be thrashed out at once. In very dry\r\nweather it is preferable to mow the plants early in the morning while\r\nthey are moist with dew, in order to avoid shattering the seed. In case\r\nthe seed is very ripe, it is well to cut the plants high and to place\r\nthe tops directly on large canvas sheets, in which they may be brought\r\nfrom the field. After thrashing, the seeds should be spread out in a\r\nthin layer and turned frequently until thoroughly dry, since they tend\r\nto become musty if closely stored before all the moisture has been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe yield of dill seed is quite variable and is much influenced by\r\nclimatic conditions. From 500 to 700 pounds of seed per acre is\r\nconsidered a good yield. The wholesale price in June, 1920, ranged from\r\n8 to 11 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINACEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEchinacea (_Brauneria angustifolia_, fig. 6) is a native perennial\r\nplant of the aster family found on the prairies of the Middle West,\r\noccurring most abundantly in Nebraska and Kansas. The roots of the\r\nplant are used medicinally.\r\n\r\nThis plant has been found to do well under, cultivation in moderately\r\nrich and well-drained loam. It grows fairly well from seeds, which may\r\nbe collected when ripe and kept dry until ready for use. Plants should\r\nbe started in a well-prepared seed bed by sowing the seeds thinly in\r\ndrills about 8 inches apart. The plants develop slowly and may be left\r\nin the seed bed for two years and then transplanted to the field in\r\nthe spring and set about 18 inches apart In rows. Thorough cultivation\r\nis essential for the best results. The roots do not reach a marketable\r\nsize under three or four years from the time of sowing the seed. They\r\nare harvested in the fall, freed from any adhering soil, and dried\r\neither in the open air or by means of low artificial heat.\r\n\r\nEchinacea has not been cultivated on a scale large enough to give\r\nsatisfactory data on the probable yield. The prewar wholesale price\r\nranged from 22 to 60 cents a pound; in June, 1920, it was 60 to 65\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Echinacea (_Brauneria angustifolia_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECAMPANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nElecampane (_Inula helenium_) Is a European perennial plant of the\r\naster family, now growing wild along roadsides and in fields throughout\r\nthe northeastern part of the United States. The root is used in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nElecampane will grow in almost any soil, but thrives best in deep\r\nclay loam well supplied with moisture. The ground on which this\r\nplant is to be grown should be deeply plowed and thoroughly prepared\r\nbefore planting. It is preferable to use divisions of old roots for\r\npropagation, and these should be set in the fall about 18 inches apart\r\nin rows 3 feet apart. Plants may also be grown from seeds, which may be\r\nsown in the spring in seeds beds and the seedlings transplanted later\r\nto the field and set in the same manner as the root divisions. Plants\r\ngrown from seed do not flower the first year. Cultivation should be\r\nsufficient to keep the soil in good condition and free from weeds.\r\n\r\nThe roots are dug in the fall of the second year, thoroughly cleaned,\r\nsliced, and dried in the shade. The available data on yield indicate\r\nthat a ton or more of dry root per acre may be expected. The price to\r\nproducers usually ranges from 3 to 6 cents a pound. Upward of 50,000\r\npounds of elecampane root were annually imported into this country\r\nprior to the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFennel (_Foeniculum vulgare_) is an Old World perennial plant of the\r\nparsley family, occasionally cultivated as a garden herb in the United\r\nStates. The aromatic seeds (fruits) are used in medicine and for\r\nflavoring. The oil distilled from the seeds is used in perfumery and\r\nfor scenting soaps.\r\n\r\nFennel grows wild in mild climates in almost any good soil and thrives\r\nin rich, well-drained loams containing lime. It is propagated from\r\nseeds, which may be sown in the open as soon as the ground is ready\r\nfor planting in the spring. The seed is sown thickly In drills 2 to 3\r\nfeet apart and covered lightly. From 4 to 5 pounds of seed should sow\r\nan acre. When well established the plants may be thinned to stand 12 to\r\n15 inches apart in the row. Plants may also be started in a seed bed\r\nfrom seed sown either in drills 6 inches apart or broadcast. When the\r\nseedlings are three or four inches high they are transplanted to the\r\nfield and set 12 to 15 inches apart in rows. The cultivation is the\r\nsame as for ordinary garden crops.\r\n\r\nFrequently, very little seed is formed the first year, but full crops\r\nmay be expected for one or two succeeding years. The seed is gathered\r\nin the fall before it is fully ripe and may be harvested like anise\r\nor coriander. A yield of 600 to 800 pounds of seed, per acre may be\r\nexpected. During recent years about 275,000 pounds of seed have been\r\nimported annually. Owing to the war, prices for the seed and oil have\r\nabout doubled. The prices in June, 1920, for the seed were 11 to 12\r\ncents a pound; for the oil, $2.75 to $3 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common or yellow gentian (_Gentiana lutea_) is the only species\r\nrecognized in American medicine, although the roots of several other\r\nspecies are found in the drug trade. The plant grows wild in the\r\nmountains of central and southern Europe, but it has proved very poorly\r\nadapted for cultivation in situations beyond its natural range. For\r\nits best development under cultivation, partial shade, similar to\r\nthat required by ginseng and goldenseal, seems necessary. The plants\r\nare said to flower when about 6 years old; hence, several years must\r\nelapse after sowing the seed before the roots reach a marketable\r\nsize. Apparently there have been no attempts to cultivate gentian\r\ncommercially in this country. The prewar wholesale price of imported\r\ngentian root ranged from 4½ to 8 cents a pound. The price in June.\r\n1920, was 12 to 13 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGINSENG.\r\n\r\n\r\nGinseng (_Panax quinquefolium_) is a fleshy-rooted herbaceous plant\r\nnative to this country and formerly of frequent occurrence in shady,\r\nwell-drained situations in hardwood forests from Maine to Minnesota and\r\nsouthward to the mountains of Georgia and the Carolinas. It has long\r\nbeen valued by the Chinese for medicinal use, though rarely credited\r\nwith curative properties by natives of other countries. When placed\r\nunder cultural conditions, ginseng should be shielded from direct\r\nsunlight by the shade of trees or by lath sheds. The soil should be\r\nfairly light and well fertilized with woods earth, rotted leaves, or\r\nfine raw bone meal, the latter applied at the rate of 1 pound to each\r\nsquare yard. Seed should be planted in the spring as early as the\r\nsoil can be worked to advantage, placed 6 inches apart each way in\r\nthe permanent beds or 2 by 6 inches in seed beds, and the seedlings\r\ntransplanted to stand 6 to 8 inches apart when 2 years old. Only\r\ncracked or partially germinated seed should be used.\r\n\r\nGinseng needs little cultivation, but the beds should at all times be\r\nkept free from weeds and grass and the surface of the soil slightly\r\nstirred whenever it shows signs of caking. A winter mulch over the\r\ncrowns is usually essential, but it should not be applied until\r\nfreezing weather is imminent and should be removed in the spring before\r\nthe first shoots come through the soil.\r\n\r\nThe roots do not reach marketable size until about the fifth or sixth\r\nyear from seed. When dug they should be carefully washed or shaken free\r\nfrom all adhering soil, but not scraped. Curing is best; effected in a\r\nwell-ventilated room heated to about 90° F. Nearly a month is required\r\nto properly cure the larger roots, and great care must be taken in\r\norder to prevent molding or souring. Overheating must also be avoided.\r\nWhen well cured the roots should be stored in a dry, airy place until\r\nready for sale. A market may be found with the wholesale drug dealers,\r\nsome of whom make a specialty of buying ginseng root for export.\r\n\r\nThe price of cultivated ginseng roots, as quoted in wholesale drug\r\nlists, ranges from $1.50 to $8 a pound, according to quality and\r\nfreedom from disease.\r\n\r\nFurther details respecting the culture of ginseng are given in a\r\nFarmers' Bulletin now in press, entitled \"Ginseng Culture,\" and in\r\nFarmers' Bulletin 736, entitled \"Ginseng Diseases and Their Control.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDENSEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoldenseal (_Hydrastis canadensis_) is a native perennial, formerly\r\nquite abundant in open woodlands having ample shade, natural drainage,\r\nand an abundance of leaf mold. Its range is from southern New York and\r\nOntario west to Minnesota and south to Georgia and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhen grown under cultivation the soil should be well fertilized,\r\npreferably by decaying vegetable matter, such as woods soil and rotting\r\nforest leaves, which should be well worked in to a depth of 10 inches\r\nor more. Raw bone meal and cottonseed meal are also favorable in their\r\naction. Seed may be sown in October in a well-prepared seed bed. It may\r\nbe scattered broadcast or dropped one-half inch apart and covered with\r\nfine leaf mold to the depth of 1 inch. During the winter the seed bed\r\nshould be protected with burlap or fertilizer sacks, and should also be\r\nguarded against encroachment of moles or mice. Plants may be set 6 to 8\r\ninches apart each way and the rootstocks covered to a depth of about 2\r\ninches. For satisfactory growth goldenseal requires about 75 per cent\r\nof shade during the summer, which should be provided by a lath shade or\r\nby cloth, brush, or vines. The soil should be kept free from weeds and\r\nthe plants liberally watered throughout the growing season, but good\r\ndrainage is necessary, since goldenseal does not thrive in boggy ground.\r\n\r\nUnder favorable conditions goldenseal reaches its best development\r\nin about, five years from seed, or, in a year or two less when grown\r\nfrom root buds or by divisions of the rootstocks. The root is dug in\r\nthe autumn after the tops have withered. They are washed clean of all\r\nsoil, sticks, etc., and dried on lath screens in an airy place in mild\r\nsunlight or partial shade, or indoors on a clean, dry floor. When dried\r\nin the open they should be protected from rain and dew. The cured root\r\nis kept in loose masses until marketed, since close packing may cause\r\nattacks of mold. The dried leaves and stems of goldenseal, commonly\r\nknown as \"seal herb,\" are also a marketable product.\r\n\r\nThe prices in June, 1920, ranged from $5 to $6 a pound for the roots\r\nand from 40 to 70 cents a pound for the herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENBANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenbane (_Hyoscyamus niger_) is a poisonous annual or biennial herb of\r\nthe nightshade family, introduced into this country from Europe and\r\noccasionally found as a weed in a number of the Northern States. The\r\nleaves, flowering tops, and sometimes the seeds are used medicinally.\r\n\r\nHenbane is propagated from seeds, but when these are sown in the open\r\nfield germination is uncertain, and a very poor stand or total failure\r\nis a frequent result. Germination is usually much more certain when\r\nthe seeds are sown under glass, but the plants do not readily stand\r\ntransplanting and often die after they are set in the open. Very good\r\nresults have been secured by sowing the seed in small pots under glass\r\nin January, transferring the seedlings to 3-inch pots in March, and\r\ntransplanting in May to the field, where the plants may be set at least\r\n15 inches apart in rows. In handling the plants care should be taken\r\nto disturb the soil about the roots as little as possible. The soil\r\nrequirements and method of cultivation are practically the same as for\r\nbelladonna.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of henbane usually suffer severely from attacks of the\r\npotato beetle, especially during the first year, and the crop is very\r\nlikely to be destroyed if grown within the range of this insect.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the plants blossom about August of the second year and\r\ndie after ripening their seed, but individual plants started early\r\nfrequently bloom and set seed the first year. The leaves and flowing\r\ntops are collected when the plants are in full bloom and are carefully\r\ndried in the shade.\r\n\r\nThe American crop of henbane has never much exceeded 10 acres. The\r\nyield under favorable conditions is estimated at about 6,000 pounds per\r\nacre. The wholesale price in June, 1920, was 35 to 38 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOREHOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorehound (_Marrubium vulgare_) is a hardy perennial herb of the mint\r\nfamily, which occurs as a common weed in many places in the United\r\nStates, especially on the Pacific coast, where it threatens to become a\r\npest. The leaves and flowering tops find some demand as a crude drug.\r\nTheir greatest use, however, is in the manufacture of candy, although\r\nthey are sometimes employed for seasoning.\r\n\r\nHorehound grows well in almost any soil and thrives in light, dry soils\r\nlacking in fertility. It grows readily from seeds, which are usually\r\nsown in drills early in the spring and covered with about an inch of\r\nsoil. Plants may also be started in coldframes, either from seed or\r\ncuttings, and later transplanted to the field. Propagation may also\r\nbe effected by division of old plants. Plants may stand 6, 12, or 18\r\ninches apart in the row; those which stand close together will have\r\nsmall stems, and hence will yield a crop of finer quality.\r\n\r\nThe plants are harvested just before flowering and should be cured in\r\nthe shade in order to preserve the green color. If the stems are small,\r\nthe plants may be cut close to the ground with a scythe, or with a\r\nmower if the area is large. In case the plants are tall and large they\r\nmust be cut some distance above the ground and all coarse stems removed\r\nto make the herb suitable for marketing.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of dry herb per acre have been\r\nobtained. The prewar wholesale prices for the herb ranged from 5 to 8\r\ncents a pound. The price in June, 1920, was 15 to 16 cents. The annual\r\nimportation of horehound varies from year to year, sometimes reaching\r\n60 to 70 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT-POWDER FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsect flowers, from which pyrethrum or insect powder is prepared,\r\nare produced by several species of plants of the aster family which\r\noccur wild in the eastern Mediterranean region, where they are also\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nThe species here considered (_Chrysanthemum_ [_Pyrethrum_]\r\n_cinerariaefolium_) has been cultivated commercially in California\r\nfor the production of insect powder. This species seems to thrive\r\nbest in warm situations and should grow well in any good soil which\r\nis well drained and not too heavy. The seeds may be sown directly\r\nin the field, either early in the spring or in the fall, but it is\r\npreferable to start the plants in coldframes or well-prepared seed\r\nbeds and transplant them to the field. The seed is mixed with sand and\r\nsown broadcast on the surface of the bed and lightly covered with a\r\nrake. Water should be used sparingly on the seed bed, since the young\r\nseedlings and even mature plants are easily killed by a wet soil.\r\nWhen the seedlings are about a month old they are transplanted, during\r\ndamp weather if possible, and set 8 to 12 inches apart in rows 3 to 4\r\nfeet apart. Old plants may also be divided and used for propagation.\r\nThe plants should be well cultivated during the growing season and\r\nwill yield flowers for several years if they are well cared for. The\r\nfertility of the soil is maintained by the application of fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe time of harvesting varies from June to September, according to\r\nlocality. The flower heads are gathered just as they open and may be\r\ncollected by hand or by means of a flower picker. They are dried,\r\npreferably in the shade, on canvas sheets about 15 feet square, on\r\nwhich they are spread in a thin layer and turned two or three times a\r\nday until dry.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of dried flowers appears to be about 450 pounds per\r\nacre. The wholesale price for these flowers in June, 1920, was 85 to 90\r\ncents a pound, which is from three to four times the prewar price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLARKSPUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larkspur of the crude-drug trade is an annual plant (_Delphinium\r\nconsolida_), native of southern Europe, which has long been cultivated\r\nin this country as an ornamental and is now occasionally found growing\r\nwild. Another species of larkspur (_Delphinium urceolatum_) is native\r\nto this country and is said to have properties very similar to those of\r\nthe European species. Larkspur seed is now used chiefly in remedies for\r\nexternal parasites.\r\n\r\nThese larkspurs thrive best in a rich sandy or gravelly soil. In\r\nheavy soils they are likely to suffer from root-rot, which materially\r\nreduces the yield. A rather dry climate is suitable for plants of this\r\ncharacter. They do not bear transplanting well and seeds should be sown\r\nin the fall or very early in the spring where the plants are to stand.\r\nThe soil should be well fined and the seed thinly sown in drills spaced\r\naccording to the method of cultivation to be used. When up, the plants\r\nshould be thinned to stand 8 inches or more apart in the rows. The\r\nnecessary cultivation consists in keeping the soil between the rows and\r\nabout the plants mellow and free from weeds during the growing season.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed capsules are fairly ripe, the seed is harvested by\r\ncollecting the tops, which should be cut before the seed capsules have\r\nbecome so brittle as to risk the loss of seed by shattering and which\r\ncan be handled best in the early morning while damp and pliable. They\r\nshould be cured in a well-ventilated place, sheltered from rain, and\r\nwhen thoroughly dry may be thrashed out and cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price now quoted for larkspur seed is between 32 and 35\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe seed of a European species of larkspur (_Delphinium staphisagria_),\r\ncommonly-called stavesacre, possesses medicinal properties and is\r\nrecognized as an official drug. The wholesale price for stavesacre seed\r\nin June, 1920, was about 30 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true lavender (_Lavandula vera_) is a small shrubby plant of the\r\nmint family, native to southern Europe, and widely cultivated for its\r\nfragrant flowers and for the oil distilled from the fresh flowering\r\ntops.\r\n\r\nLavender thrives best in light and rather dry soils well supplied with\r\nlime, but may be grown in almost any well-drained loam. On low or wet\r\nland it is almost certain to winterkill. The plant is not easily grown\r\nfrom seed, but may be readily propagated from cuttings or by division.\r\nIn cold climates the plants must be well protected during the winter,\r\nor they may be carried over in a greenhouse or coldframe. Early in the\r\nspring the plants or rooted cuttings are set in well-prepared soil, 12\r\nto 15 inches apart in rows spaced to suit the cultivation intended.\r\nFrequent and thorough cultivation is desirable.\r\n\r\nNot many blooms can be cut the first year, but full crops may be\r\nexpected for each of the three following years, after which it will be\r\nbest to start new plantings. The flowering tops are harvested when they\r\nare in full bloom, and if used for the production of oil are distilled\r\nat once without drying. If the dry flowers are wanted, the tops are\r\ncarefully dried in the shade and the flowers later stripped from the\r\nstems by hand.\r\n\r\nOn ordinary soil, yields of 600 to 1,200 pounds per acre of fresh\r\nflowering tops have been obtained. The dry weight is about four-fifths\r\nof the green weight. The yield of oil varies widely, but from 12 to 15\r\npounds per acre may be expected under good conditions. The wholesale\r\nprices in June, 1920, were about as follows: For \"ordinary\" flowers,\r\nfrom 18 to 24 cents a pound; for \"select\" flowers, from 30 to 35 cents\r\na pound; for oil of lavender flowers, $11 to $12 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLICORICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicorice (_Glycyrrhiza glabra_) is an Old World plant, the culture of\r\nwhich has not succeeded commercially in this country, although the\r\nplant grows well in the arid Southwest and in California, where in some\r\nlocalities it threatens to become a weed. Licorice is used to some\r\nextent in medicine, and is said to be much in demand by manufacturers\r\nof tobacco.\r\n\r\nLicorice is a fairly hardy plant, but it thrives best in warm regions,\r\nwhere the season is sufficiently long to promote strong growth. Plants\r\nmay be grown from seed, but propagation by means of cuttings made from\r\nthe younger parts of the Rhizome, or so-called root, usually gives best\r\nresults. The cuttings are set perpendicularly in deep, moist, sandy, or\r\nloamy soil, and should stand about 18 inches apart in rows so spaced as\r\nto allow for the cultivation necessary to keep the soil mellow and free\r\nfrom weeds.\r\n\r\nThe yield under good culture is said to average about 5,000 pounds\r\nof dry root per acre at the end of every third year. The relatively\r\nlow price at which, the imported root can usually be obtained has so\r\nfar prevented the development of commercial licorice growing in this\r\ncountry. Nearly 100,000,000 pounds of licorice root and an average of\r\nabout 600,000 pounds of licorice paste are annually imported into the\r\nUnited States when trade conditions are normal.\r\n\r\nPrewar prices for the imported root usually ranged from 4 to 5½ cents a\r\npound in bales. The price in June, 1920, was 13 to 14 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBELIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLobelia (_Lobelia inflata_) is a native poisonous annual plant,\r\noccurring generally in open woods and pastures, but is most abundant in\r\nthe States east of the Mississippi River. The leaves, tops, and seeds\r\nare used medicinally.\r\n\r\nThis plant thrives under cultivation in a rather rich, moist loam, and\r\ngrows well either in the open or in partial shade. It grows readily\r\nfrom seeds, which are very small and must be sown on soil which has\r\nbeen well fined and exceptionally well prepared. The seeds are sown\r\neither in the fall or spring in rows 2 feet apart. It is best not to\r\ncover the seeds but to sow them on the surface of the soil, which is\r\nthen firmed with a float or by resting a board over the row and walking\r\nupon it. Fall planting usually gives a better stand and a heavier crop.\r\nShallow cultivation should be given until the plants begin to flower.\r\n\r\nLobelia is harvested when in full flower or as soon as some of the\r\nolder seed pods are full grown. The plants may be cut with a mower if\r\nthe cutter bar is set high enough to avoid including the large stems.\r\nThe herb should be dried in the shade, in order to preserve the green\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nSmall areas have given yields at the rate of 1,000 pounds of dry herb\r\nper acre. The prewar price paid to collectors for the dried herb was\r\nabout 3 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were, for the herb, 20\r\ncents; for the seed, 75 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLovage (_Levisticum officinale_) is a perennial plant of the parsley\r\nfamily, introduced into this country from Europe as a garden plant and\r\nnow grown as a crop in certain localities in New England and the West.\r\nThe root has long been supposed to have medicinal properties and is\r\nin some demand in the drug trade. The flowering tops yield a volatile\r\noil, for which, however, there is little demand. The seeds are used for\r\nflavoring confectionery and the leaf stems are sometimes blanched, like\r\ncelery, and eaten as a salad.\r\n\r\nLovage is propagated by division or from seeds. The seeds may be\r\nplanted in the fall in drills 18 inches apart or sown in early spring\r\nin a hotbed, greenhouse, or well-prepared seed bed in a sheltered\r\nportion of the garden. They should be covered very lightly with sand\r\nor fine sifted soil, and in order to prevent the soil from drying out\r\nbefore the seeds germinate it is advisable to spread old burlap or\r\nsacking over the bed. The sacking may be sprinkled occasionally if the\r\nweather is dry and should be removed when the first seedlings break\r\nthe soil. The plants should reach a size suitable for transplanting\r\nby the end of May, when they may be set at intervals of 8 inches in\r\nrows far enough apart for convenient cultivation. Lovage grows well in\r\nalmost any deep, well-drained soil, such as will produce a fair crop of\r\ncorn or potatoes, and is benefited by the liberal use of fertilizer,\r\nalthough heavy applications of manure tend to produce excessive top\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe roots may be dug in October of the second or third year after\r\nsetting the plants. Numerous offsets will generally be found, and if\r\nthese have good roots they may be used to renew the plantation without\r\nrecourse to seed. Such shoots should at once be reset at the usual\r\ndistances apart. The freshly dug roots should be well washed, cut into\r\nslices about one-half inch thick, and carefully dried. If necessary,\r\nartificial heat, not to exceed 125° F., may be used to hasten drying.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 1,000\r\npounds of dried root to the acre may be expected under good conditions\r\nevery third year. The prices quoted for American lovage root in the\r\nwholesale drug markets range from 45 cents to $1 a pound, according to\r\ndemand and quality. Producers, however, usually receive much less than\r\nthe wholesale price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELISSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelissa, balm, or lemon balm (_Melissa officinalis_), is a perennial\r\nherb of the mint family, native to southern Europe. In this country\r\nit has long been cultivated in gardens, from which it has escaped and\r\nnow grows wild in many places in the eastern United States. The leaves\r\nof balm are widely used for culinary flavoring, and the leaves and\r\nflowering tops are used in medicine. The volatile oil distilled from\r\nthe plant is said to be used in perfumery and also for flavoring.\r\n\r\nBalm grows readily on any good garden soil and is easily propagated\r\nfrom seeds, cuttings, or by division. The seeds may be sown in the open\r\nearly in the spring, but owing to their small size it is best to sow\r\nthem in shallow flats in a greenhouse or in a hotbed. The soil should\r\nbe well fined and the seeds sown thinly on the surface of the soil,\r\nwhich is then firmed with a float or a small board. When well up, the\r\nseedlings should be transferred to deeper flats, and when 4 or 5 inches\r\nhigh they may be transplanted to the open and set about a foot apart in\r\nrows spaced to suit the cultivation to be given. Cultivation should be\r\nfrequent and sufficient to keep the soil about the plants mellow and\r\nfree from weeds.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are in full flower the crop can be cut with a scythe,\r\nor with a mower if the herb is to be used for distillation. For\r\npreparing the crude drug only the flowering tops are collected, the\r\ncoarse, stemmy portions of the herb being rejected. The leaves and tops\r\nare dried in the shade in order to preserve the green color.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of about 1,800 pounds of dry herb per acre have been\r\nobtained, but if only the flowering tops are collected the yield will\r\nbe very materially less. The prewar price paid to collectors for the\r\nleaves and tops ranged from 3 to 4 cents a pound. In June, 1920, the\r\nprice for the leaves was 15 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrris (_Iris florentina_) is a perennial, native to southern Europe,\r\nand is cultivated chiefly in Italy for its fragrant rootstocks, which\r\nyield the orris of commerce. The plant grows well in a variety of\r\nsoils and flourishes in a rich, moist loam, but roots which are grown\r\nin rather dry, gravelly soil appear to be the most fragrant. Orris\r\nis readily propagated by division of the old plants, which may be\r\nset either in the spring or fall about a foot apart in rows spaced\r\nconveniently for cultivation.\r\n\r\nSince harvesting usually takes place only once in three years, the use\r\nof the land is required for that length of time in order to obtain one\r\ncrop. After the roots are dug they are peeled and dried in the open\r\nair. The desired fragrance does not develop until after the dry roots\r\nhave been stored for a number of months, during which time they are\r\nespecially liable to the attacks of insects.\r\n\r\nThe yield is from 5 to 6 tons of dry root per acre. The average annual\r\nimportation of orris is normally about 500,000 pounds. The wholesale\r\nprices, which before the war ranged from 6 to 10 cents, in June,\r\n1920, were 14 to 15 cents a pound. The outlook for a profitable orris\r\nindustry in this country does not appear promising, and it does not\r\nseem advisable for any considerable number of persons to undertake the\r\ngrowing of this crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nParsley (_Petroselinum sativum_) is a biennial herb grown everywhere\r\nin gardens for use in garnishing and seasoning. All parts of the plant\r\ncontain a volatile oil, that from the seed being especially rich in a\r\nconstituent known as apiol, or \"parsley camphor,\" which is still used\r\nto some extent in medicine. In the crude-drug trade there is a small\r\ndemand for the root, leaves, and seed.\r\n\r\nA rich and rather moist soil is desirable for the growing of parsley.\r\nThe seeds germinate slowly and are frequently sown early in the spring\r\nin cold frames or seed beds, from which the young plants may be removed\r\nlater and set in the open in rows 12 or more inches apart and about\r\n6 inches apart in the row. When the leaves are fully grown they may\r\nbe collected and dried in the usual manner. The plants flower in\r\nthe second year, and as soon as the seed is ripe it is harvested and\r\ncarefully dried. At the end of the second growing season, late in\r\nOctober, the root may be dug and should be well washed and carefully\r\ndried. Artificial heat may be used in drying if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn small areas yields of seed at the rate of about 185 pounds per acre\r\nhave been obtained. During the past few years the wholesale price of\r\nthe seed has varied from 10 to 70 cents a pound, according to demand\r\nand season. From 15 to 50 pounds of seed are required to yield 1 pound\r\nof the oil, which in June, 1920, was quoted at $6.50 to $7 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNYROYAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPennyroyal (_Hedeoma pulegioides_) is an annual plant, flowering\r\nfrom June to October, and is found in dry soils from Nova Scotia and\r\nQuebec to Dakota and southward. Both the dry herb and the oil obtained\r\ntherefrom by steam distillation form marketable products.\r\n\r\nPennyroyal grows well on average upland soils and is frequently\r\nabundant on sandy or gravelly slopes. In field planting the seeds\r\nshould be sown in rows in the fall and covered not to exceed\r\none-quarter of an inch, since they rarely germinate if planted at\r\na greater depth. The plants come up early in the spring, and to\r\nsecure the best results clean cultivation and freedom from weeds are\r\nessential, as with all cultivated crops.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer, when the plants are in full flower, they may be\r\nmowed. To prepare the herb for market the plants are dried, preferably\r\nin the shade, and carefully packed immediately after drying. All the\r\nlarge stems should be removed in order to improve the quality of the\r\nproduct. The herb should be marketed promptly, since it deteriorates\r\nwith age. For the production of the volatile oil, the plants should be\r\nharvested when in full flower and distilled without drying.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 1,200\r\npounds of dry herb per acre may be expected. The yield of oil varies\r\nfrom 15 to 30 pounds per acre. The price paid for the dry herb usually\r\nranges from 1 to 2 cents a pound. The wholesale price of the oil ranges\r\nfrom about $1 to $2 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERMINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeppermint (_Mentha piperita_) is a perennial of the mint family,\r\nfrequently found growing wild in moist situations throughout the\r\neastern half of the United States. It is cultivated on a commercial\r\nscale, chiefly on the muck lands of southern Michigan and northern\r\nIndiana. The volatile oil forms the principal marketable product, but\r\nthere is some demand in the crude-drug trade for the dried leaves and\r\nflowering tops.\r\n\r\nPeppermint is propagated from \"roots,\" or runners, which should be set\r\nin an almost continuous row in furrows about 3 feet apart and covered\r\nto a depth of about 3 inches. It can be grown on any land that will\r\nproduce good crops of corn, but is most successful on the muck lands of\r\nreclaimed swamps. On uplands it soon exhausts the soil and will not do\r\nwell for more than two or three seasons without the rotation of crops.\r\nOn rich muck lands it will grow for a number of years, the soil being\r\nplowed after the crop is harvested and the runners turned in to form\r\na new growth the succeeding year. It is essential that the ground be\r\nkept free from weeds, since their presence in the crop at harvest would\r\nseriously injure the quality of the oil.\r\n\r\nWhen peppermint is grown on reclaimed swamps or muck lands fertilizers\r\nare rarely needed, but on uplands it is well to plow in 12 or more\r\ntons per acre of rotted stable manure before planting. Similar\r\napplications may be made between the rows in early spring and plowed\r\nin as the land shows signs of exhaustion. Commercial truck or potato\r\nfertilizers cultivated in between the rows at the rate of 600 pounds\r\nto the acre have proved useful in keeping up fertility, but manure is\r\nto be preferred, as it provides humus or vegetable matter as well as\r\nincreases the fertility.\r\n\r\nHarvesting is begun in July or August, when the plants are in full\r\nbloom. The herb is cut and cured like hay, and when fairly well dried\r\nis placed in large vats or stills having a capacity of from 1 to 3 tons\r\nof dry herb and distilled with steam to obtain the volatile oil. The\r\nyield of oil is exceedingly variable, but on lands well suited for the\r\nproduction of peppermint the average yield is not far from 30 pounds\r\nper acre. The annual production of peppermint oil in the United States\r\nis about 300,000 pounds. For many years before the war the price of the\r\noil varied from year to year, but averaged about $2.50 a pound. There\r\nis some demand for the dried leaves and tops, for which 6 to 15 cents a\r\npound was paid to collectors in June, 1920.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the growing of peppermint, see Farmers'\r\nBulletin 694, entitled \"The Cultivation of Peppermint and Spearmint.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINKROOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Pinkroot (_Spigelia marilandica_).]\r\n\r\nPinkroot (_Spigelia marilandica_, fig. 7) is a native perennial herb\r\noccurring in rich open woods from New Jersey to Wisconsin and south\r\nto Florida and Texas. The root is an official drug, the use of which\r\nhas declined in recent years, apparently on account of the extent to\r\nwhich pinkroot has been adulterated with the worthless roots of another\r\nplant known as East Tennessee pinkroot. Prospective growers of pinkroot\r\nshould obtain seeds or roots for planting from thoroughly reliable\r\nsources only.\r\n\r\nPinkroot makes a vigorous growth under conditions suitable for growing\r\nginseng or goldenseal, and partial shade is usually necessary, although\r\nif given a rich, moist, loamy soil it may be grown without shade in\r\nsituations not too hot and dry. It is propagated either from seeds or\r\nfrom divisions of old roots. It is best to sow the seeds as soon as\r\nthey are ripe, but if mixed with moist sand and kept in a cool place\r\nsowing may be deferred until fall or the following spring. The seeds\r\nare sown in drills 6 inches apart in well-prepared seed beds, and in\r\nthe spring, when the young plants are a few inches high, they are set\r\nabout a foot apart each way in the permanent beds. The old roots are\r\ndivided when dormant, and each division should consist of a portion of\r\nthe root with one or more buds and a number of the small rootlets. They\r\nare set in the same manner as the seedlings. Thorough cultivation and\r\nfreedom from weeds are essential for good results.\r\n\r\nThe roots usually attain a marketable size in three years, but will\r\ngive a heavier yield at the end of the fourth or fifth year. They are\r\nharvested in the fall, and after the tops are cut off the roots are\r\nwell washed and thoroughly dried. Little can be said regarding yield,\r\nbut returns from small areas indicate that a bed 4 by 30 feet will\r\nyield from 10 to 12 pounds of dry root in four years. The prices paid\r\nto collectors of pinkroot before the war ranged from 15 to 30 cents a\r\npound. The price in June, 1920, was about 60 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOKEWEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPokeweed (_Phytolacca americana_) is a native plant of frequent\r\noccurrence in moist, rich soil along fences and in uncultivated land\r\nthroughout the eastern half of the United States. The root, which is\r\nperennial, sends up large annual stems, sometimes attaining a height of\r\n8 or 9 feet. This plant bears numerous long clusters of smooth, shining\r\npurple berries, very attractive in appearance, but the seeds are said\r\nto be poisonous. Both the root and the berries are used in medicine.\r\n\r\nPokeweed thrives in deep, rich soils well supplied with moisture and\r\nmay be readily grown from seed sown early in the spring in rows 4 feet\r\napart and barely covered. The seedlings may be thinned to stand about 3\r\nfeet apart in the rows. Cultivation should be shallow, though frequent.\r\nThe plant develops a long, thick, and fleshy root, which when old is\r\nnot easily harvested and may have to be dug by hand. If the roots of\r\nplants grown from seed are harvested at the end of the first year,\r\nthey may be turned out by means of a deep-running plow without great\r\ndifficulty. As soon as they are dug the roots are cleaned by washing\r\nand are usually cut into lengthwise or transverse slices for drying.\r\nThey should be thoroughly dried, and if a large quantity is to be\r\nhandled the use of artificial heat will be found desirable.\r\n\r\nA yield of about 600 pounds of dry root per acre may be expected at the\r\nend of the first year, or three or four times as much from plants of\r\nthe second year's growth. In the second year several hundred pounds of\r\nberries may also be obtained from 1 acre.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, collectors received from 2 to 3 cents a pound for the\r\nroots and berries. The price in June, 1920, for the dry, cut root was\r\nabout 6 cents and for the dry berries 15 cents a pound. Apparently\r\nthere is but a small demand for either of these products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFFLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSafflower, American saffron, or false saffron (_Carthamus tinctorius_)\r\nis a hardy Old World annual of the aster family, cultivated in gardens\r\nin this country for its flowers, which are used in coloring or for\r\nflavoring, and sometimes as a substitute for the true saffron.\r\n\r\nSafflower grows well on moist soils and may be readily propagated from\r\nseeds sown in the open early in the spring. The soil should be fine\r\nand mellow, and the seeds sown an inch or more apart in drills and\r\nwell covered. About three weeks from the time of sowing the seed the\r\nplants will be well started, and cultivation should begin at once and\r\nbe continued until the flower buds form. The plants bloom in July or\r\nAugust, when harvesting may begin. Only the florets are collected, and,\r\nsince these must be removed by hand, harvesting is slow and expensive.\r\nThe plants continue to blossom for several weeks, and the florets must\r\nbe harvested almost daily. It is best to collect them early in the\r\nmorning and to dry them in the shade on trays having muslin bottoms.\r\nThe florets should be turned daily until thoroughly dry and then stored\r\nin tin containers.\r\n\r\nThe yield is estimated at 125 to 150 pounds of dry florets per acre.\r\nThe price for safflower is variable and ranges from 19 to 60 cents a\r\npound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFFRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true saffron (_Crocus sativus_) is a low-growing, fall-blooming,\r\nbulbous plant of the iris family, native to southern Europe, where it\r\nis cultivated commercially. It was formerly grown as a small garden\r\ncrop in some localities in this country, chiefly in Lancaster and\r\nLebanon Counties, Pa. The stigmas of the flowers form the saffron of\r\ncommerce. Saffron is used in cookery and for coloring confectionery,\r\nand was formerly widely used in medicine.\r\n\r\nA rich, well-drained garden soil favors a vigorous growth of the plant,\r\nbut a better quality of saffron is secured on land of medium fertility.\r\nIt is propagated from bulbs (corms), which may be planted in August\r\nabout 6 inches apart each way and 6 inches deep in well-prepared soil.\r\nWhen grown on a large scale the bulbs are often set late in the spring.\r\nThe ground is laid off in rows about 20 inches apart, and a furrow 6\r\nto 8 inches deep is opened for each row. In this furrow the bulbs are\r\nset in two parallel rows about 4 inches apart and about 2 inches apart\r\nin the row. The furrows are then filled and the surface of the soil\r\nbrought to a uniform level. Thorough cultivation and freedom from weeds\r\nare essential for good results.\r\n\r\nThe purplish blossoms usually appear about October, but the main leaf\r\ngrowth of the plant is made in the following spring. The bulbs may\r\nremain undisturbed for three or four years, or they may be taken up\r\nyearly and the clusters divided. All unsound bulbs should be rejected,\r\nas they are often attacked by a fungus which readily spreads to the\r\nsound bulbs, causing them to rot. During the blossoming period, which\r\nfrequently lasts from two to three weeks, the flowers are collected\r\ndaily just as they open. The orange-colored stigmas are then removed\r\nfrom the flowers, either by pulling them out or by cutting them off\r\nwith the finger nail, after which the flowers are thrown away. The\r\nstigmas are dried immediately, a common method being to spread them in\r\na thin layer on a sieve which is suspended over a low fire. When fully\r\ndry they are placed in linen bags and stored in a dry place.\r\n\r\nThe yield of saffron is variously estimated at from 10 to 30 pounds\r\nper acre, according to the situation where it Is grown. About 50,000\r\nflowers are required to produce a pound of dry saffron; consequently,\r\nthe amount of hand labor involved in removing the stigmas is quite\r\nlarge. The price usually received for saffron in normal times is not\r\nfar from $8 a pound, but the prices in June, 1920, ranged from $14 to\r\n$15 a pound. Owing to the high cost of production, it is not thought\r\nprobable that saffron culture would prove profitable in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common sage plant (_Salvia officinalis_) is a hardy perennial\r\nof the mint family, widely cultivated in gardens, and when once\r\nestablished it persists for several years. The leaves are used\r\nextensively for seasoning meats and soups, and a tea made from them is\r\nan old household remedy.\r\n\r\nSage is easily cultivated and will grow in any well-drained fertile\r\nsoil, but seems to thrive best in a rich clayey loam. For cultivation\r\non a large scale the seeds are sown in early spring in rows from 2 to 3\r\nfeet apart, and when the plants are well up they are thinned to stand\r\nabout 12 inches apart in the row. Seedling plants have a tendency to\r\nproduce narrow leaves; hence, the broad-leaved varieties which do not\r\nflower readily are the most desirable, since they give a larger yield\r\nof leaves. As the plants rarely set seed, they are usually grown from\r\ncuttings, which may be obtained from seed houses having their own\r\npropagating gardens. Cuttings set as early in the spring as weather\r\nconditions will permit usually give a large crop. In the North the\r\nplants should be protected In winter by a mulch of manure. Sage may\r\nalso be grown as a second crop after early vegetables.\r\n\r\nA fair crop of leaves may be harvested the first season and a much\r\nlarger one for five or six years following. Only one picking should be\r\nmade the first year, after which two or three pickings may be made in a\r\nseason. If a product of fine quality is desired, the leaves are picked\r\nby hand and dried in the shade. Sage leaves are apt to turn black while\r\ndrying unless the removal of moisture proceeds continually until they\r\nare fully dry. A cheap grade may be obtained at a smaller harvest cost\r\nby cutting the plants with a mower, the cutter bar of which is set at\r\nsuch a height as not to include the woody stems. The dry herb should be\r\nmarketed promptly, since it loses its strength rapidly with age.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas indicate that on good soil a yield of\r\n2,000 pounds or more of dried tops per acre may be expected. In case\r\nthe leaves only are harvested, the yield will be proportionately less.\r\nAmerican leaf sage usually brings a considerably higher price than that\r\nimported from Europe. During the last three years the price has ranged\r\nfrom 20 to 70 cents a pound, according to supply and demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Seneca snakeroot (_Polygala senega_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENECA SNAKEROOT.\r\n\r\nSeneca snakeroot, known also as senega or seneca root (_Polygala\r\nsenega_, fig. 8), is a small native perennial, occurring in rocky woods\r\nin the eastern United States and Canada. Seneca is not yet grown on a\r\ncommercial scale, although cultivated experimentally in a number of\r\nplaces. The root is used in medicine.\r\n\r\nSeneca can be grown in good garden soil or in rather firm, stony soil,\r\nprovided it contains a fair proportion of leaf mold or very well rotted\r\nmanure. Shade is not essential, although the plant thrives in partial\r\nshade or under modified forest conditions. Roots for propagation may be\r\nobtained from dealers or may be collected from the wild in autumn or\r\nearly spring. If set 15 inches apart in rows, the plants may be readily\r\ncultivated until they reach a marketable size. The seeds ripen in June\r\nand may then be planted, or they may be stratified by mixing with sand\r\nand buried in boxes or flower pots in moist soil until the following\r\nspring, when they may be sown in seed beds or shallow boxes of loam\r\nand leaf mold. The seedlings when old enough to be handled safely may\r\nbe transplanted to the permanent beds and set in rows to facilitate\r\ncultivation. In cold situations they will probably need to be protected\r\nduring the first winter after transplanting. A light covering of straw\r\nor pine needles will be sufficient to protect them from severe frost.\r\n\r\nThe plant is slow in growth, but experiments thus far indicate that\r\nabout four years are required to obtain marketable roots. The roots\r\nshould be dug in the fall, thoroughly cleaned, and dried. There are no\r\nreliable data on the probable yield. Seneca root is in constant demand,\r\nand collectors formerly received from 35 to 50 cents a pound. The price\r\nto collectors in June, 1920, was 90 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERPENTARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentaria, or Virginia snakeroot (_Aristolochia serpentaria_), is a\r\nnative perennial plant occurring in rich woods in the eastern part of\r\nthe United States, and most abundantly along the Allegheny Mountains.\r\nThe roots of this plant are used in medicine.\r\n\r\nLike many other woodland plants, serpentaria requires a rich, moist\r\nloam and partial shade for its best development. It may be readily\r\npropagated from seeds, which, however, require several months for\r\ngermination. The seeds are best sown in a well-prepared seed bed as\r\nsoon as they are ripe. They may also be sown broadcast or in drills 6\r\ninches apart and lightly covered with leaf mold. A thin mulch of straw\r\nor leaves will afford the necessary winter protection. In the spring\r\nthe plants may be set 6 inches apart each way in the permanent beds.\r\nPlantings have been made in the open, in which case the plants were set\r\n4 inches apart in rows 16 inches apart, but the results have been less\r\nsatisfactory than with plantings made under shade.\r\n\r\nThe roots are collected in the fall, thoroughly cleaned, and carefully\r\ndried. Satisfactory data on probable yields under cultivation are not\r\navailable. The price usually ranges from 30 to 45 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEARMINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpearmint (_Mentha spicata_) is a well-known perennial of the mint\r\nfamily which is very frequently found growing wild in moist situations\r\nthroughout the eastern half of the United States. It is widely used\r\nfor seasoning meats, and the leaves and flowering tops, as well as\r\nthe volatile oil distilled from the whole herb, form marketable drug\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nSpearmint is easily grown in any fertile soil which is fairly moist.\r\nIts culture and the method of distilling the volatile oil are the same\r\nas for peppermint. To prepare the dry herb for market the leaves and\r\nflowering tops are collected when the first flowers appear and before\r\nthe leaves begin to fall and are carefully dried in the shade. The\r\ndemand for the dry herb is small, but the annual market requirement for\r\nthe oil is about 50,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn ordinary soils the yield of oil varies from 10 to 20 pounds per\r\nacre, according to stand and season, but on muck lands the yield is\r\nusually only a little less than that of peppermint. Before the war the\r\nwholesale prices for the oil ranged from $1.50 to $5, averaging about\r\n$3.30 a pound. The price in June, 1920, was $12 a pound. The dry herb,\r\nwhich formerly brought from 3 to 4 cents, is now quoted at 6 to 12\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the growing of spearmint, see Farmers'\r\nBulletin 694, entitled \"The Cultivation of Peppermint and Spearmint.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAMONIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nStramonium, Jamestown weed, or jimson weed (_Datura stramonium_), is\r\na poisonous annual of the nightshade family, which occurs as a common\r\nweed in almost all parts of this country except the West and North. The\r\nleaves and seeds are used medicinally.\r\n\r\nAlthough stramonium grows wild on a variety of soils, it thrives best\r\nunder cultivation in rich and rather heavy soils which are fairly well\r\nsupplied with lime. It grows readily from seed, which may be sown in\r\nthe open early in the spring in drills 3 feet apart and barely covered.\r\nWhen the plants are well established they are thinned to stand 12 to 15\r\ninches apart in the row. The plants can be readily transplanted, and\r\ngaps occurring in the rows may be filled in with the plants removed in\r\nthinning. Cultivation sufficient to keep the soil free from weeds is\r\nnecessary for good growth.\r\n\r\nCultivated plants are frequently attacked by leaf-eating insects,\r\nespecially in the early stages of growth, and it is often necessary to\r\nuse lime or other insect repellents to prevent the destruction of the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, which are collected when the plant is in full bloom, may\r\nbe picked in the field, but time will be saved if the entire plant is\r\ncut and dried in an artificially heated curing room at a temperature of\r\n100° to 110° F. When the leaves are dry they can be readily stripped\r\nfrom the stems, and should be baled for shipment. Such seed as is ripe\r\nmay be easily thrashed out of the capsules after the leaves have been\r\nremoved from the stems.\r\n\r\nYields of dry leaf at the rate of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds per acre\r\nhave been obtained. The yield of seed is much more variable, and is\r\nestimated to range from 500 to 2,000 pounds per acre. The prewar price\r\nfor the leaves varied from 2 to 10 cents and for the seed from 3 to 7\r\ncents a pound. The price in June, 1920, for the leaves was 22 cents and\r\nfor the seed 12 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTANSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_) is a European perennial plant, long\r\ncultivated in this country in gardens, from which it has escaped, and\r\nit now occurs as a weed along fence rows and roadsides. The leaves and\r\nflowering tops are in some demand for medicinal purposes. The herb also\r\nyields a volatile oil, for which there is a small market.\r\n\r\nTansy grows well on almost any good soil, but rich and rather heavy\r\nsoils well supplied with moisture favor a heavy growth of herb. It may\r\nbe propagated from seed, but is more readily propagated by division\r\nof the roots early in spring. The divisions are set 18 inches apart\r\nin rows 3 feet apart. Seed may be sown very early in the spring in\r\nthe open or in seed beds, and the seedlings later transplanted to the\r\nfield. Such cultivation as is usually given to garden crops will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nThe plants are cut late in the summer when in full flower, the leaves\r\nand tops being separated from the stems and dried without exposure to\r\nthe sun, as the trade desires a bright-green color. For the volatile\r\noil the plants are allowed to lie in the field after cutting until\r\nthey have lost a considerable portion of their moisture. They are then\r\nbrought to the still and the oil removed by the usual method of steam\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nA yield of about 2,000 pounds of dry leaves and flowering tops per acre\r\nmay be obtained under good conditions. The yield of oil varies, but\r\nabout 20 pounds per acre is a fair average. In the United States the\r\ncenter of production of oil of tansy is Michigan, where about 2,500\r\npounds are distilled annually. The price of the oil in June, 1920, was\r\nabout $8 a pound. The price of the leaves and tops usually ranges from\r\n3 to 5 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThyme (_Thymus vulgaris_) is a shrublike perennial plant of the mint\r\nfamily, native to southwestern Europe. It is a common garden plant,\r\nwhich lives for many years under good culture. The herb, often used\r\nfor seasoning and flavoring, yields the oil of thyme, which has\r\nwell-recognized medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nThyme grows well from seed, which may be sown early in the spring in\r\ndrills 3 feet apart, or the plants may be started in a greenhouse or in\r\nseed beds outside and later set at intervals of about 18 inches in rows\r\n2 to 3 feet apart. Thyme may also be propagated, like geraniums, from\r\ncuttings rooted in sand under glass. The plants grow well in mellow\r\nupland soil of good quality, and should be well cultivated and kept\r\nfree from weeds throughout the growing season.\r\n\r\nFor preparing the dry herb only the flowering tops are used, and these\r\nare cut when the plant is in full bloom and carefully dried in the\r\nshade in order to preserve the natural color. The volatile oil is\r\nobtained from the entire herb, which is preferably cut when in full\r\nflower and subjected to steam distillation without previous drying.\r\n\r\nReturns from experimental areas have shown great variations in the\r\nyield, which has averaged about a ton of green herb per acre. Normally\r\nthe yield from a planting increases for several years, as the plants\r\nbecome better established, and yields at the rate of about a ton of dry\r\nherb per acre have been reported. The wholesale price in June, 1920,\r\nfor the dry herb ranged from 11 to 15 cents a pound; for the imported\r\noil, from $1.85 to $2.25 a pound, according to quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALERIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nValerian (_Valeriana officinalis_) is a hardy herbaceous perennial,\r\nwell known under the name \"garden heliotrope\" and often grown as an\r\nornamental plant. It has also been cultivated as a drug plant in New\r\nYork and in parts of New England. The dried roots (rhizome and roots)\r\nform the marketable drug.\r\n\r\nValerian grows well in all ordinary soils, but thrives in a rich and\r\nrather heavy loam which is well supplied with moisture. It may be\r\nreadily propagated by dividing the old roots, either in the fall or in\r\nthe spring, and setting the divisions about a foot apart in rows 2 to\r\n3 feet apart. If the divisions are set very early in the fall in time\r\nto become well established before frost, a good crop may usually be\r\nharvested the following autumn. Plants may also be grown from seed,\r\nwhich are preferably sown as soon as they are ripe in well-protected\r\nseed beds in the garden. Early in the spring the seedlings may be\r\ntransplanted to the field and set at the same distances apart as the\r\ndivisions of the root. Growth will be favored by a liberal application\r\nof farmyard manure, which should be well worked into the soil before\r\nthe plants are set out. Thorough cultivation is essential.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the plants propagated by division may be dug in the fall\r\nof the first year's growth, although the yield will probably be small.\r\nThose of seedling plants do not usually reach a size suitable for\r\nharvesting before the end of the second growing season. After digging,\r\nthe roots are washed, preferably in running water, until all adhering\r\nsoil is removed. Washing and drying will be facilitated if the thick\r\nportion of the roots is sliced lengthwise. The drying should be very\r\nthorough, and the use of artificial heat will be found advisable.\r\n\r\nUnder good conditions a yield of 2,000 pounds or more of dried roots\r\nper acre may reasonably be expected. The prewar price ranged from 6\r\nto 30 cents a pound, depending upon the place where grown, that from\r\nEngland usually commanding the highest price. The wholesale price in\r\nJune, 1920, was about 22 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nVetiver, or cuscus grass (_Vetiveria zizanioides_), is a perennial\r\nof the grass family, native to southern Asia. It is occasionally\r\ncultivated in this country in the warmer portions of the Gulf Coast\r\nStates as an ornamental and also for its aromatic roots, which are\r\noften used to impart a fragrance to clothing. In other countries an oil\r\nis distilled from the roots and used in the manufacture of perfumes.\r\n\r\nVetiver will grow in almost any soil, but light, sandy soil enriched by\r\nfarmyard manure is to be preferred. Propagation is effected by dividing\r\nold Clumps, which may be set in the field, either in the fall or\r\nspring, about 4 or 5 feet apart each way. During the growing season the\r\nplants are given sufficient cultivation to keep them free from weeds.\r\nVetiver grows in close bunches from 6 to 8 feet high, the numerous\r\nroots spreading horizontally about 2 feet on all sides of the plant.\r\n\r\nHarvesting the roots, which usually takes place in November, is a\r\nlaborious operation. The soil about the plants is opened with a stout,\r\nsharp spade in a circle large enough to include most of the roots. The\r\nearth is then dug from beneath the center of the plant and the entire\r\nclump lifted. The roots are first beaten or shaken to free them from\r\nadhering soil, then cut off close to the root crown and thoroughly\r\nwashed. They may be dried in the open air, but it is preferable to\r\ndry them in a closed room at a low temperature, since they lose in\r\nfragrance if exposed to the hot sun or to a free circulation of air.\r\n\r\nYields at the rate of 600 to 1,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have\r\nbeen obtained. The prices in the markets of New Orleans are said to\r\nrange from 75 cents to $1 a pound. The oil is not produced commercially\r\nin this country. The demand for both roots and oil is quite small, and\r\nit has not yet been shown that vetiver would be a profitable crop in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERGREEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWintergreen (_Gaultheria procumbens_) is a low-growing, broad-leaved,\r\nevergreen plant with a creeping stem. The shoots from this stem grow to\r\na height of 4 to 5 inches and bear solitary white flowers, which are\r\nfollowed by red berries. These berries are edible and are widely known\r\nas teaberries or checkerberries. Wintergreen is a common plant in woods\r\nand clearings from eastern Canada southward to the Gulf States, but its\r\ncollection in quantity is somewhat difficult. Both the dry herb and the\r\noil form marketable products.\r\n\r\nLike other woodland plants, wintergreen thrives only in partial\r\nshade, and plantings should be made in a grove or under a specially\r\nconstructed shade, such as is used for ginseng or goldenseal. A fairly\r\ngood growth may be expected in soil which is thoroughly mixed with\r\nleaf mold to a depth of 4 inches or more. Wild plants may be used for\r\npropagation. Divisions of these may be set in the fall or spring, about\r\n6 inches apart each way, in permanent beds.\r\n\r\nWintergreen is usually gathered in October or at the end of the growing\r\nseason. The plants are carefully dried and packed in bags or boxes for\r\nmarketing. For the production of the volatile oil the plants are soaked\r\nin water for about 24 hours and then distilled with steam. Over 22,000\r\npounds of wintergreen oil were produced in this country in 1909 and\r\n6,000 pounds in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe prewar price of the oil distilled from the wintergreen plant as\r\nquoted in the wholesale drug markets generally ranged from $3 to $5\r\na pound. Recently the lack of labor has reduced the output of oil,\r\nand in consequence the price has advanced. The oil became practically\r\nunobtainable on the markets in October, 1919, at which time it had\r\nreached a price of $11 a pound. Collectors usually receive from 4 to 5\r\ncents a pound for the dry herb. The results of numerous trials indicate\r\nthat, on account of the small yield, wintergreen production under\r\ncultivation is not likely to be profitable at the prices quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMSEED, AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican wormseed, or Jerusalem oak (_Chenopodium ambrosioides\r\nanthelminticum_), is a coarse weed, occurring commonly in waste places\r\nand often in cultivated ground throughout the eastern and southern\r\nparts of the United States. The seeds (fruits) and the volatile oil\r\ndistilled from the tops of the plant are employed in medicine.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows well under cultivation in almost any soil, but a\r\ngood sandy loam is preferred. It is now cultivated for oil production\r\nonly in a small area in Carroll County, Md. The seed is sown in\r\nwell-prepared beds about March 1, and between May 15 and June 15, when\r\nthe seedlings are 4 to 5 inches tall, they are transplanted and set\r\nabout 10 inches apart in rows about 3 feet apart. The soil is kept\r\nentirely free from weeds by shallow cultivation throughout the growing\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nHarvesting is usually begun early in September or as soon as the seeds\r\nhave taken on a black color, but before the plants have turned brown.\r\nIf harvesting is delayed until the plants are fully mature there will\r\nbe considerable loss through shattering and a diminution in the yield\r\nof oil when they are distilled. The crop is harvested with large knives\r\nor sickles, either by cutting off the entire plant at the ground or\r\nby cutting the branches separately. The latter method saves the labor\r\nof handling a quantity of useless woody material and also requires a\r\nsmaller still capacity to handle the crop. After cutting, the plants\r\nare laid out on the ground in rows and allowed to cure for about three\r\ndays before they are distilled.\r\n\r\nIn the South wormseed has been grown successfully as a seed crop.\r\nThe ground is prepared in February and laid off in rows about 4 feet\r\napart. A furrow is opened in each row, in which a complete fertilizer\r\nis applied at the rate of 400 to 500 pounds per acre. The soil on each\r\nside of the row is thrown in with a turnplow, forming a low ridge,\r\nwhich is then flattened with a light roller. The seeds are sown on this\r\nridge with a drill. The plants are thinned to stand 18 inches apart in\r\nthe row and are given frequent shallow cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe crop should be ready for harvesting late in July or early in August\r\nand should be cut before the tops begin to take on a brown color. The\r\nplants are cut either with a mower or old-style grain reaper and are\r\nleft in the field until thoroughly dry. They may be housed and the seed\r\nthrashed out when convenient, but, since the seeds shatter easily,\r\nwaste will be avoided if the plants are thrown upon large canvas\r\nsheets and the seed thrashed out in the field. The seed is light and\r\nnot easily cleaned, but wire sieves of suitable mesh have proved very\r\nsatisfactory for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe yield of seed per acre averages about 1,000 pounds. The yield of\r\noil varies, but under favorable conditions about 40 pounds per acre\r\nis regarded as a fair average. The area planted varies according to\r\nthe price of the oil and may range from 175 to 450 acres. The average\r\nannual production of oil is estimated by producers to be 10,000 to\r\n12,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe prewar price of wormseed ranged from 6 to 8 cents a pound. The\r\nprice in June, 1920, was about 15 cents a pound. The prewar price of\r\nthe oil ranged from $1.40 to $5.50 a pound. The price in June, 1920,\r\nwas $9 to $9.50 a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWormwood (_Artemisia absinthium_) is a hardy herbaceous Old World\r\nperennial of the aster family, which has escaped from cultivation\r\nin this country and now occurs as a weed in many localities in the\r\nsouthern part of the United States. For many years it has been grown\r\ncommercially on a small scale, chiefly in Michigan and Wisconsin. The\r\ndried leaves and tops have long been used medicinally, but the volatile\r\noil distilled from the plant now forms the principal marketable product.\r\n\r\nWormwood will grow in almost any soil, but the best results are to\r\nbe expected in deep, rich, moderately moist loams. The seeds are\r\nfrequently sown broadcast early in the fall, following a grain crop;\r\nbut if the plants are to be cultivated, it is best to start them from\r\nseeds sown in seed beds early in the spring or from cuttings of the\r\nyoung shoots taken in the spring and rooted in sand under glass or\r\nin the shade of a lath shed. The seeds are very small and should be\r\nsown on the surface of the soil in coldframes or seed beds and lightly\r\ncovered with very fine sandy soil. The plants are easily handled and\r\nmay be transplanted in moist weather with good results at almost any\r\ntime during the growing season. They are set about 18 inches apart in\r\nrows 3 or 4 feet apart and are well cultivated. The soil should be kept\r\nabsolutely free from weeds, since their presence in the crop at harvest\r\ntime seriously damages the quality of the oil. A fair cutting of the\r\nherb may be expected the first year after planting and full crops for\r\ntwo or three successive, seasons, after which new plantings will be\r\nfound more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe plants are harvested when in full bloom and may be cut with a\r\nscythe, or a reaper may be used if the area is large. While still\r\nfresh, the plants are distilled with steam to obtain the volatile oil.\r\nTo prepare the leaves and flowering tops for market they are stripped\r\nfrom the stems by hand after the plants are cut and carefully dried in\r\nthe shade without the use of artificial heat.\r\n\r\nExperimental plantings have given yields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of\r\ndry tops or 40 pounds of oil per acre. When grown on a commercial scale\r\nthe yield of oil appears to average about 20 pounds per acre.\r\n\r\nThe prewar price of the dry tops was about 6 or 7 cents a pound. Its\r\nprice in June, 1920, was 17 to 18 cents a pound. The oil was once used\r\nextensively in the manufacture of absinth, but when the use of this\r\nproduct was restricted in 1912 the demand for the oil fell off and the\r\nprice declined, until in the early part of 1915 it reached the low\r\nlevel of $2 a pound. The price in June, 1920, was about $13 a pound.\r\nThe average annual production of oil of wormwood is about 2,000 pounds.\r\nOwing to the limited use of this oil, there appears to be little room\r\nfor further profitable expansion of this industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ADDITIONAL COPIES\r\n               OF THIS PUBLICATION MAY BE PROCURED FROM\r\n                    THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS\r\n                      GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\r\n                           WASHINGTON, D.
