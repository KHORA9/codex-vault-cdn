In this way, the\r\ncontribution made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\nis highlighted against the background of overall progress in each\r\ndiscipline. Succeeding issues will document the results from later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe initial issue of this series appears in 10 volumes (NASA Special\r\nPublications 91 to 100) which describe the achievements in the following\r\nareas: Astronomy, Bioscience, Communications and Navigation, Geodesy,\r\nIonospheres and Radio Physics, Meteorology, Particles and Fields,\r\nPlanetary Atmospheres, Planetology, and Solar Physics.\r\n\r\nAlthough we do not here attempt to name those who have contributed to\r\nour program during these first 6 years, both in the experimental and\r\ntheoretical research and in the analysis, compilation, and reporting of\r\nresults, nevertheless we wish to acknowledge all the contributions to a\r\nvery fruitful program in which this country may take justifiable pride.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Homer E.

Closely related research even though\r\nnot sponsored by NASA is also included.\r\n\r\nThe space biology program has had a late start in comparison with the\r\nspace physics program, and only a token program existed before 1962.\r\nMuch of the present research involves preparation of space-flight\r\nexperiments and obtainment of adequate baseline information. Perhaps\r\nhalf the research results reported are derived from the NASA program.\r\nAdditional information is included from many other sources, especially\r\nthe U.S. Air Force with its long history of work in aviation and\r\naerospace medicine.\r\n\r\nRelatively few biological space-flight experiments have been undertaken.\r\nThese have been to test life-support systems and to demonstrate, before\r\nmanned space flight, an animal’s capability to survive. Few critical\r\nbiological experiments have been placed in orbit by NASA, but a\r\nbiosatellite program will soon make a detailed study of the fundamental\r\nbiological effects of weightlessness, biorhythms, and radiation.\r\n\r\nThe search for extraterrestrial life has been limited to ground-based\r\nresearch and planning for planetary and lunar landings. Life-detection\r\nexperiments have been developed and tested, and an important and\r\nexciting program is being planned to detect and study extraterrestrial\r\nlife, if it exists.\r\n\r\nInterest in space biology has been slow in developing, and there has\r\nbeen some caution and controversy in the scientific community. However,\r\nincreased interest is starting to push forward the frontier of this new\r\nand important scientific field, and future outlook appears to be\r\noptimistic.\r\n\r\nThis summary was written and compiled by the members of the Bioscience\r\nPrograms Division of the Office of Space Science and Applications.

A small life sciences group, organized\r\nin 1958, was concerned with life support and use of primates for system\r\nand vehicle testing for the Mercury program. Three small suborbital\r\nflights of biological materials were flown in space.\r\n\r\nThe Bioscience Program Office of the Office of Space Science and\r\nApplications was organized in 1962. The goals of the Bioscience Program\r\nare: (1) to determine if extraterrestrial life exists anywhere in the\r\nsolar system and to study its origin, nature, and level of development,\r\nif it is present; (2) to determine the effects of space and planetary\r\nenvironments on Earth organisms, including man; (3) to conduct\r\nbiological research to develop life support and protective measures for\r\nextended manned space flight; and (4) to develop fundamental theories in\r\nbiology relative to origin, development, and relationship to\r\nenvironment. Research and development has been carried out to design\r\nlife-detection experiments and instruments for future flights to Mars\r\nand to develop experiments to study the effects of the space environment\r\non living organisms. A biosatellite program, started in 1963, has the\r\nfirst of six flights scheduled for 1966.\r\n\r\nSpace exploration has demanded a rigorous development, especially in the\r\nbiosciences area. Investigation of the solar system for exotic life\r\nforms, the environmental extremes to which Earth organisms (including\r\nman) are being exposed, the possibilities for modification of planetary\r\nenvironments by biological techniques yet to be developed, and the\r\nproblems of communication in biosystems are areas which have required\r\nrefinement of the theoretical framework of biology before progress could\r\nbe made rapidly enough to keep pace with technological advances in\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nOf all the sciences, biology alone has not yet benefited from\r\ncomparisons with the universe beyond Earth. It is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat breakthroughs might be made in biology on the basis of comparisons\r\nwith life from other worlds. Organisms elsewhere may have found\r\nalternatives to processes we think of as basic characteristics of life.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, physical science has advanced sufficiently to provide a\r\ngreat body of laws which may be expressed in mathematical terms, and by\r\nwhich phenomena may be predicted with complete accuracy. A well-known\r\ncharacteristic of biological phenomena is variability. The Darwinian\r\nconcept of evolution is perhaps the only pervading generalization in\r\nbiology. This concept has been supported by evidence of a hereditary\r\nmechanism in the discovery of genes and gene mutations.\r\n\r\nSpace bioscience represents the convergence of main disciplines with a\r\nsingle orientation, whose direction is determined by the problems of\r\nmanned space travel which have, in turn, created a host of\r\nbioengineering problems concerned with supporting man in space.\r\n\r\nForemost among these questions is the possibility of the existence of\r\nextraterrestrial life. The field which is concerned with the search for\r\nextraterrestrial life has come to be called \"exobiology.\" In addition to\r\nthe challenge of great technological problems which must be solved,\r\nexobiology is so closely related to the central scientific questions in\r\nbiological science that it is considered by some to be the most\r\nsignificant pursuit in all of science.\r\n\r\nOne of the major opportunities already presented by the advances in\r\npropulsion systems is the ability to escape from the influence of the\r\nEarth, which has made possible the study of organism-environment\r\nrelationships, particularly the role that environmental stimuli play in\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of normal organization in living\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nTranscending even these formidable objectives of space bioscience is an\r\nobjective shared by all life sciences, the discovery of nature’s scheme\r\nfor coding the messages contained in biological molecules.\r\nExtraterrestrial biology seeks to find not only evidence of life now\r\npresent, but the vestigial chemicals of its previous existence. The ways\r\nand means have already been made available to study molecules on whose\r\nlong, recorded messages is written the autobiography of evolution—the\r\nhistory of living organisms extending back to the beginnings of life. On\r\nthis same basis, it is now within the realm of science to foresee the\r\nmeans of predicting the development of life from primordial, nonliving\r\nchemical systems. Closely allied to the search for extraterrestrial life\r\nis research which seeks to identify the materials and the conditions\r\nwhich are the prerequisites of life.\r\n\r\nSpace bioscience research is now extending human knowledge of\r\nfundamental biological phenomena, both in space and on Earth, just as\r\nthe physical sciences explore other aspects of the universe. The\r\naccomplishment of bioscience objectives is totally dependent upon\r\nadvances in the technology of space flight. A highly developed\r\nlaunch-vehicle capability is essential to accomplish the long-duration\r\nmissions required in the search for extraterrestrial life.\r\n\r\nLife on other planets in the solar system (with emphasis on Mars) will\r\nbe investigated by full exploitation of space technology which will\r\nallow both remote (orbiter) and direct (lander) observations of the\r\nplanetary atmosphere, surface, and subsurface. Certain characteristics\r\nof terrestrial life, such as growth and reproduction, provide a basis\r\nfor relatively simple experiments which may be used on early missions to\r\ndetect the existence of life on Mars. Later missions will provide\r\nextensive automatic laboratory capabilities for analyzing many samples\r\ntaken from various depths and locations. Because of the hypothetical\r\nnature of current experiment designs, it is likely that visual\r\nobservations of the planet will be required. Many technical problems are\r\ninvolved in storing and transmitting the large amounts of data over\r\nplanetary distances. Such visual observations might very well be crucial\r\nin interpreting results from other experiments. Critical to all\r\nexploration of the Moon and planets are the requirements to: (1) prevent\r\ncontamination of the environment with Earth organisms and preserve the\r\nexisting conditions of the planet for biological exploration; (2)\r\nprovide strict quarantine for anything returned to Earth from the Moon\r\nand planets.\r\n\r\nThe biological exploration of Mars is a scientific undertaking of the\r\ngreatest significance. Its realization will be a major milestone in the\r\nhistory of human achievement. The characterization of life, if present,\r\nand study of the evolutionary processes involved and their relationship\r\nto the evolution of terrestrial life would have a great scientific and\r\nphilosophical impact. What is at stake is nothing less than knowledge of\r\nour place in nature.\r\n\r\nExtended Earth orbital flights with subhuman specimens will be used to\r\ndetermine the effects on Earth organisms of prolonged weightlessness,\r\nradiation, and removal from the influence of the Earth’s rotation. Such\r\nflights of biosatellites and other suitable spacecraft are expected to:\r\n(1) establish biological specifications for extending the duration of\r\nmanned space flight; (2) provide a flexible means of testing unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, thus providing an effective biological backup for manned\r\nmissions; (3) yield experimental data more rapidly by virtue of the\r\ngreater number and expendability of subjects; (4) anticipate possible\r\ndelayed effects appearing in later life or in subsequent generations,\r\nthrough use of animal subjects with more rapid development and aging;\r\n(5) develop and test new physiological instrumentation techniques,\r\nsurgical preparations, prophylactic techniques, and therapeutic\r\nprocedures which are not possible on human subjects; and (6) provide a\r\nbroad background of experience and data which will permit more accurate\r\ninterpretations of observed effects of space flight on living organisms,\r\nincluding man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 2\r\n\r\n_Exobiology_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility of discovering an independent life form on a planet\r\nother than Earth presents an unequaled challenge in the history of\r\nscientific search. Therefore, the detection of life within the solar\r\nsystem is a major objective of space research in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nThe scientific data presently available concerning the possible\r\nexistence of a Martian life form and the chemical constitution of the\r\nsurface of Mars are disappointingly few. In fact, it is impossible to\r\nmake a statement about any of the many surface features, other than the\r\npolar caps, with any degree of certainty. The observational results have\r\nbeen accounted for by many conflicting hypotheses which can only be\r\nresolved by the accumulation of new evidence.\r\n\r\nThe arguments supporting the existence of Martian life ([ref.1]) are\r\nbased on the following observations:\r\n\r\n  (1) The various colors, including green, exhibited by the dark areas\r\n  (2) The seasonal changes in the visual albedo and polarization of the\r\n      dark areas\r\n  (3) The ability of the dark areas to regenerate after an extensive\r\n      \"duststorm\"\r\n  (4) The presence of absorption bands at 3.3µ-3.7µ, attributed to\r\n      organic molecules\r\n\r\nConflicting interpretations of the above observations have been\r\nadvanced. The argument based on the colors is inconclusive, and several\r\nworkers have suggested that the color is a contrast effect with the\r\nbright-reddish continents. The meager quantitative data have been\r\ndiscussed by Öpik ([ref.2]) who has reduced Kozyrev’s photometric\r\nobservations of the very dark area of Syrtis Major to intrinsic\r\nreflectivities by allowing for the estimated atmospheric attenuation and\r\nreflectivity. Kuiper ([ref.3]) similarly demonstrated the absence of the\r\nnear-infrared reflection maximum, which is characteristic of most green\r\nplants, indicating that chlorophyll was not responsible for the color.\r\n\r\nThe second and third arguments remain the most cogent. However, serious\r\nlimitations are imposed on the second if the severity of the Martian\r\nclimate is considered. Föcas ([ref.4]) has photometrically measured the\r\nseasonal changes in the fine structure of the dark areas of Mars and\r\nconcludes that—\r\n\r\n  (1) The dark areas of Mars show periodic variation of intensity\r\n      following the cycle of the darkening element\r\n  (2) The average intensity of the dark area, not including the action\r\n      of the darkening waves, increases from the poles toward the\r\n      equator\r\n  (3) The action of each of the darkening waves decreases from the poles\r\n      toward the equator. This decrease is balanced in the equatorial\r\n      zone by the combined action of the two darkening waves alternately\r\n      originating at the two poles. The mechanism of the\r\n      darkness-generating element seems to be constant for all latitudes\r\n      during the Martian year.\r\n\r\nThe variation in intensity has been explained recently by nonlife\r\nmechanisms for Depressio Hellespontica (an area showing one of the\r\ngreatest seasonal changes) ([ref.2]). Similar nonlife mechanisms may be\r\napplicable to the other dark regions, and, thus, the \"darkening\" can be\r\nused only as circumstantial evidence in support of a Martian life form.\r\n\r\nIf inorganic interpretations of the seasonal albedo variation are\r\naccepted, then an inorganic interpretation must also be advanced for the\r\npolarization variation. Two possibilities can be suggested:\r\n\r\n  (1) A change in surface texture, caused by varying absorption of\r\n      atmospheric constituents, causing both the albedo and polarization\r\n      to change in the manner observed\r\n  (2) A change in surface texture, in which the surface material becomes\r\n      rougher, which also explains the observed polarization data\r\n      ([ref.5])\r\n\r\nThe third argument against the regenerative feature of the dark areas\r\nbeing a life process has been advanced by Kuiper ([ref.6]). It is based\r\non atmospheric circulation causing dust, presumably lava, to be blown on\r\nthe dark areas of Mars during the late summer, autumn, and winter, and\r\nthen removed during the spring. Mamikunian and Moore have recently\r\nadvanced the similar explanation that carbonaceous chondrites or\r\nasteroidal matter may induce the observed phenomenon if they are\r\nabundant on the planet’s surface. The pulverized chondritic material\r\nwill exhibit a high degree of opacity due to localization and, hence, a\r\nchange in polarization characteristics and a decrease in polarization\r\nfollowing mixing of the chondritic material with indigenous surface\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe fourth observational argument, the Sinton bands ([ref.7]), has been\r\nshown to be at least doubtful. Rea, Belsky, and Calvin ([ref.8])\r\nrecorded infrared reflection spectra for a large number of inorganic and\r\norganic samples, including minerals and biological specimens, for the\r\npurpose of interpreting the 3µ-to-1µ spectrum of Mars. These authors\r\nstate that a previous suggestion that the Martian \"bands\" be attributed\r\nsolely to carbohydrates is not a required conclusion. At the same time\r\nthey fail to present a satisfactory alternate explanation, and the\r\nproblem remains unsolved. More recently, Rea et al. ([ref.9]) noted the\r\nsimilarity between the 3.58µ and 3.69µ minima in the Martian infrared\r\nspectra and those of D₂O-HDO-H₂O mixtures and, particularly, of HDO.\r\n\r\nWith all this marked disagreement in interpreting the observational data\r\nconcerning Mars, it becomes clearly evident that an experimental\r\napproach to the detection of life on Mars should provide the maximum\r\npositive information possible. Some life-detection experiments developed\r\nwith NASA support have been summarized by Quimby ([ref.10]).\r\n\r\nThe schema of the biological exploration of a planet is to conduct a\r\nseries of complementary experiments proceeding from general to specific.\r\nThe general experiments will examine gross characteristics of the\r\nplanet’s environment and surface for determining the probability of an\r\nactive biota (life). Data from the general experiments will be\r\nsignificant in—\r\n\r\n  (1) Defining the nature of specific experiments in which life\r\n      detection is the major objective; and\r\n  (2) Providing a high degree of confidence in undertaking specific\r\n      experiments, since indications from the gross characterization of\r\n      the planet in question will influence the choice and design of the\r\n      specific experiments.\r\n\r\nThe biological exploration of planets is then to be defined as the\r\nsearch for those parameters relevant to the origin, development,\r\nsustenance, and degradation of life in a planetary environment. This\r\ndefinition will give rise to a critical question for each progressively\r\nspecific and complex experiment to determine—\r\n\r\n  (1) The existence of life on the planet\r\n  (2) The degree of similarity or dissimilarity (structure and function)\r\n      with respect to terrestrial life\r\n  (3) The origin of this planetary life\r\n\r\nThe immediate objective of the biological explorations of the planet is\r\nto define the state of the planetary surface, which may exhibit the\r\nfollowing properties:\r\n\r\n  (1) A prebiota (defined as the absence of life)\r\n  (2) An active biota (defined as the presence of life)\r\n  (3) An extinct biota (defined as evidence of former life)\r\n\r\nThe identification and the detailed characterization of each of the\r\nabove stages of planetary development constitute the subject matter of\r\nthe biological exploration of the planets and, specifically, Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICAL EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to simulate and approximate models of primitive\r\nEarth conditions for abiogenic synthesis, and successful synthesis of\r\nessential biochemical constituents necessary for maintaining life has\r\nbeen partly accomplished.\r\n\r\nUrey ([ref.11]) has clearly pointed out the possible role of a reducing\r\natmosphere in the synthesis of prebiological organic molecules. Miller\r\n([ref.12]) synthesized a variety of amino acids in a reducing atmosphere\r\nby means of an electrical discharge. A variety of organic compounds have\r\nbeen synthesized by the action of various energy sources upon reducing\r\natmospheres, and several investigators have extended the\r\nUrey-Miller-type reactions to synthesize nucleic acid components\r\n([ref.13]), adenosine triphosphate ([ref.14]), and a host of\r\nbiologically essential organic compounds.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that in the synthesis of organic moieties, simple and\r\nspecific molecules were first produced when the planets had a reducing\r\natmosphere. Further complexity or degradation of the organic compounds\r\nproduced varied, depending on the geochemical changes of the planet’s\r\nsurface, the atmospheric constituents, the degree of interaction between\r\nsurface and atmosphere, and the rate of the organic synthesis. Oparin\r\n([ref.15]) presented the most detailed mechanisms for the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of the first living organism arising in a sea of organic\r\ncompounds synthesized in a reducing atmosphere on Earth.\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted that, under favorable conditions, life can\r\narise by spontaneous generation. A primary requirement for this\r\ninitiation is that there be abundant organic compounds concentrated in\r\none or more specific zones. These simple organic molecules would undergo\r\nmodification to develop a greater structural complexity and specificity,\r\nfinally giving rise to a \"living\" organism. Therefore, because of the\r\nease with which organic compounds can be synthesized under reducing\r\nconditions, planetary surfaces may contain an abundant source of similar\r\norganic matter. However, difficulties arise in postulating steps for\r\nfurther organization or modification of the above synthesized organic\r\nmatter into a living state. Most of the original organic matter produced\r\nin the primary reducing atmospheres of the various planets may have been\r\nquite similar. However, major variations between planets, in chemical\r\nevolution beyond the prebiotic stage, must have been the rule rather\r\nthan the exception.\r\n\r\nThe primary interest in this area of research has been the realization\r\nof the possible existence of organic molecules on planetary surfaces\r\nand, particularly, Mars. Pertinent synthesis may be either biological or\r\nabiological. Research conducted in the simulation of cosmochemical\r\nsynthesis has used most of the available solar spectrum. Simulation\r\nexperiments devised to study the effects of these energies on the\r\nassumed early atmosphere of the Earth have yielded products that play a\r\ndominant role in molecular and biochemical organization of the cell.\r\n\r\nCalvin ([ref.16]) irradiated water and carbon dioxide in a cyclotron,\r\nobtaining formaldehyde and formic acid. Miller ([ref.17]) found that\r\nwhen methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen were subjected to a\r\nhigh-frequency electrical discharge, several amino acids were produced\r\nalong with a variety of other organic compounds.\r\n\r\nCorroborating experiments established that the synthesis of amino acids\r\noccurred readily. The apparent mechanism for the production of amino\r\nacids is as follows: aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide are synthesized in\r\nthe gas phase by the electrical discharge. These substances react\r\ntogether and also together with ammonia in the water phase of the system\r\nto give hydroxy and amino nitriles, which are then hydrolyzed to hydroxy\r\nand amino acids. Among the major constituents were aspartic acid,\r\nglutamic acid, glycine, α-alanine, and β-alanine.\r\n\r\nThe \"Miller-Urey\" reaction mixture has been extended and several\r\nmodifications introduced. Oró ([ref.18]) introduced hydrogen cyanide\r\ninto the system as the primary gas component. Adenine was obtained when\r\nOró heated a concentrated solution of hydrogen cyanide in aqueous\r\nammonia for several days at temperatures up to 100° C. Adenine is an\r\nessential component of nucleic acids and of several important coenzymes.\r\nGuanine and urea were the two other products identified in the hydrogen\r\ncyanide reaction. Oró further obtained guanine and uracil as products of\r\nnonenzymatic reactions by using certain purine intermediates as starting\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nPonnamperuma ([ref.19]) also obtained adenine upon irradiation of\r\nmethane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water, using a high-energy electron beam\r\nas the source of energy of irradiation. These results indicate that\r\nadenine is very readily synthesized under abiotic conditions. Adenine,\r\namong the biologically important purines and pyrimidines, has the\r\ngreatest resonance energy, thus making its synthesis more likely and\r\nimparting greater radiation stability to the molecule.\r\n\r\nThe formation of adenine and guanine, the purines in RNA and DNA, by a\r\nrelatively simple abiological process lends further support to the\r\nhypothesis that essential biochemical constituents of life may have\r\noriginated on Earth by a gradual chemical evolution and selection. In\r\nthis respect, the examination of planetary surfaces—specifically\r\nMars—presents practical implications for current research on the problem\r\nof chemical evolution.\r\n\r\nWhen Ponnamperuma et al. ([ref.14]) exposed adenine and ribose to\r\nultraviolet light in the presence of phosphate, adenosine was produced.\r\nWhen the adenine and ribose were similarly exposed in the presence of\r\nthe ethyl ester of polyphosphoric acid, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and\r\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) were produced. The abiological formation of\r\nATP was a major stride along the path of chemical evolution, since ATP\r\nis the principal free energy source of living organisms.\r\n\r\nOparin ([ref.15]) postulated that α-amino acids could have been formed\r\nnonbiologically from hydrocarbons, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide at a\r\ntime when the Earth’s atmosphere contained these substances in high\r\nconcentrations. Oparin’s hypothesis has received strong experimental\r\nsupport, as evidenced by the work of Miller ([ref.12]). Bernal\r\n([ref.20]) has emphasized the role played by ultraviolet light in the\r\nformation of organic compounds at a certain stage of the Earth’s\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nGenerally it has been believed that the first proteins or foreprotein\r\nwere nonbiologically formed by the polycondensation of preformed free\r\namino acids ([ref.21]). Akabori ([ref.22]) proposed a hypothesis for the\r\norigin of the foreprotein and speculated that it must have been produced\r\nthrough reactions consisting of the following three steps.\r\n\r\nThe first step is the formation of aminoacetonitrile from formaldehyde,\r\nammonia, and hydrogen cyanide.\r\n\r\n    CH₂O + NH₃ + HCN ————> H₂N—CH₂—CN + H₂O\r\n\r\nThe second is the polymerization of aminoacetonitrile on a solid\r\nsurface, probably absorbed on clay, followed by the hydrolysis of the\r\npolymer to polyglycine and ammonia.\r\n\r\n    x H₂N—CH₂—CN ————> (—NH—CH₂—C—)ₓ\r\n                             ||\r\n                             ||\r\n                             NH\r\n                             |\r\n                             |    + x H₂O\r\n                             |\r\n                             V\r\n                       (—NH—CH₂—CO—)ₓ + x NH₃\r\n\r\nThe third step is the introduction of side chains into polyglycine by\r\nthe reaction with aldehydes or with unsaturated hydrocarbons. Akabori\r\nhas demonstrated experimentally the formation of cystinyl and cysteinyl\r\nresidue in his above-postulated mechanism.\r\n\r\nFox’s theory of thermal copolymerization ([ref.23]) suggests that\r\nproteins or like molecular units could have been formed in the Earth’s\r\ncrust, under geothermal conditions. The accumulated amino acids were\r\nheat polymerized and transported into the primary oceans for further\r\nmodifications. Fox has obtained polymers consisting of all 18 amino\r\nacids usually present in proteins. The polymerization is generally done\r\nat 160° C to 200° C, although in the presence of polyphosphoric acid it\r\ncan be accomplished at temperatures below 100° C. Molecular weights\r\nincreased from 3600 in a proteinoid made at 160° C to 8600 in one made\r\nat 190° C.\r\n\r\nFox showed that when hot saturated solutions of thermal copolymers\r\ncontaining the 18 common amino acids were allowed to cool, large numbers\r\nof uniform, relatively firm, and elastic spherules separate. These range\r\nfrom 0.2µ to 60µ in diameter and are quite uniform within each\r\npreparation. Various chemical observations suggest the presence of\r\npeptide bonds in the structural organization of these proteinoids.\r\nContinuing observations of these microspheres have established further\r\ncharacteristics that point to the possibility of their interpretation as\r\na kind of primitive protein macromolecule with self-organizing\r\nproperties, such that a primitive form of cell, with boundary and other\r\nproperties, might form.\r\n\r\nIn laboratory experiments the behavior of gram-negative and\r\ngram-positive microspheres in dilute alkali parallels that of\r\ngram-negative and gram-positive bacteria ([ref.23]). Furthermore,\r\ntime-lapse studies indicate that the proteinoid microspheres undergo a\r\nseptate kind of fission, mimicking cell division as shown in figure 1.\r\nCytochemical studies show that the microsphere’s boundary is\r\nmembranelike in having a primitive selectivity. Electron micrographs of\r\nsections of stained microspheres also indicate the presence of a\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nOparin ([ref.15]) states that the type of organization peculiar to life\r\ncould only result from the evolution of a multimolecular organic system\r\nseparated from its environment by a distinct boundary but constantly\r\ninteracting with this environment. In his concept of coacervates as\r\nprecell models, Oparin ([ref.24]) indicates that present-day protoplasm\r\npossesses a number of features similar to coacervate structure. These\r\ncoacervates could represent the starting point for evolution leading to\r\nthe origin of life. Moreover, in the course of their evolution the\r\ninitial systems may gradually become more complex. Oparin also showed\r\n([ref.15]) that mixing solutions of different proteins and other\r\nsubstances of high molecular weight produced these coacervate droplets.\r\nThese droplets are characterized by the formation of a surface layer\r\nwith altered structure and mechanical properties, thus providing a\r\nsomewhat selective barrier in which to house a molecular system capable\r\nof replication. However, these coacervates are unstable structurally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.—_Protenoid microspheres undergoing septate\r\nfission. Small microspheres and filamentous associations thereof are\r\nalso shown ([ref.25])._]\r\n\r\nThe NASA program has further provided considerable impetus for\r\ncontinuing research with respect to the chemical evolution of life,\r\nsince its life-detection experiments may encounter prebiological\r\nmolecules in their search for extraterrestrial life on other planetary\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nIn the area of exobiological research, the significant accomplishments\r\nto date have been—\r\n\r\n  (1) The reconstruction of some of the pathways which may have led to\r\n      the origin of life, by means of laboratory simulation of processes\r\n      yielding prebiological organic molecules\r\n  (2) The developments in experimental and theoretical biology;\r\n      specifically, the role of nucleic acid-protein interactions in\r\n      storage and transmission of information both within living cells\r\n      and from generation to generation of cells\r\n  (3) The suspected role of DNA in information storage and the\r\n      development of new concepts of the coding mechanism in DNA that\r\n      may lead to a universal biological theory embracing evolutionary,\r\n      as well as homeostatic, adaptation to environment and learned\r\n      behavioral systems\r\n\r\nWith the essential biochemical constituents of life and the mechanism of\r\nreplication beginning to be understood, the challenge for the synthesis\r\nof living matter by abiogenic experimental techniques has become to many\r\nscientists the ultimate goal of the scientific era.\r\n\r\nNASA has established an exobiology laboratory at Ames Research Center in\r\naddition to the sizable support of research at various academic centers\r\nof excellence for the continuation of abiogenic synthesis.\r\n\r\nAlthough research on organochemical evolution is in its infancy, the\r\ndata from relatively few experiments have already created an immense\r\nenthusiasm for knowledge of the biochemical pathways of evolution. This\r\nkind of research will ultimately elucidate the terrestrial evolution of\r\nlife and, perhaps, the nature of life on other planetary bodies and the\r\ndistribution of life in our galaxy.\r\n\r\nThis program, with its vast demands on the scientific community at\r\nlarge, is coordinated with related endeavors of a number of Federal\r\nagencies. It is allied with certain biochemical studies at the National\r\nInstitutes of Health for the eventual elucidation of the dynamic\r\npathways in cosmochemical synthesis of life’s essential biochemical\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  METEORITES AND ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nMeteorites\r\n\r\nA significant area of exobiological research is the investigation of a\r\nspecial class of stony meteorites known as \"carbonaceous chondrites.\" It\r\nis increasingly apparent that almost all life-detection concepts rely on\r\nthe eventual analysis of the solid materials that may be available on\r\nMars and other planetary surfaces. Cosmic dust and meteorites are two\r\nclasses of material bodies that reach the Earth from outer space. The\r\ncarbonaceous chondrites are the only extraterrestrial materials known to\r\ncontain organic carbon.\r\n\r\nThe study of meteorites has generated an astonishing diversity of\r\nhypotheses. There is agreement at only one point: that meteorites are\r\npreserved chunks of very ancient, perhaps primordial, planetary matter\r\nand that when we are able to understand the curious structures and\r\nchemical and isotopic variations in the meteorites, we will also know a\r\ngreat deal about early planetary (and perhaps preplanetary) history.\r\n\r\nMeteorites provide a more representative sample of average planetary\r\nmatter than the highly differentiated crust of the Earth. Although it is\r\nknown that the meteorite parent bodies ceased to be geochemically active\r\nshortly after their formation, some 4½ billion years ago, there is no\r\nconsensus on the nature of the meteorite parent bodies, not even on such\r\nbasic properties as size, location, and multiplicity. This is not\r\nsurprising because the meteorite samples commonly available for study\r\nrepresent only about 10⁻²³ to 10⁻²⁶ of the parent body.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbonaceous Meteorites\r\n\r\nAnalysis and characterization of the chemical constituents (organic) of\r\ncarbonaceous chondrites, including the possible mechanism of their\r\nformation, may be expected to improve methods of analyzing samples from\r\nthe Moon and planets and of interpreting remote automated biological\r\nanalyses on the planets’ surfaces.\r\n\r\nCarbon has been detected in all meteorites analyzed; however, both the\r\namount and forms present vary considerably. Among the forms of meteorite\r\ncarbon are diamond, graphite, cohenite (Fe,Ni,Co)₃C, moissanite SiC,\r\ncalcite CaCO₃, dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO₃, bruennerite (Mg,Fe)CO₃. A summary of\r\nthe results of carbon analyses on large numbers of meteorites is given\r\nin table I ([ref.26]).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Table I.—_Meteorite Carbon_\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Meteorite group               Number    Mean carbon content,\r\n                                    analyzed    percent by weight\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Pallasites                           10              0.08\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Ureilites                             2               .69\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Bronzite chondrites                  12               .05\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Hypersthene chondrites                8               .04\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Enstatite chondrites                  8               .29\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Carbonaceous chondrites              16              2.04\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMost meteorites possess only traces of carbon, and studies of this\r\ncarbon indicate that it is composed largely of graphite, cohenite, and\r\nmoissanite, with some diamond. However, studies of the carbon in the\r\ncarbonaceous chondrites have failed to detect any of these forms. Some\r\ncarbonates are present in a minority of the carbonaceous group, but\r\naccount for only a small percentage of the total carbon (perhaps about\r\n10 percent of the total C in type I only).\r\n\r\nThe carbonaceous chondrites contain organic carbon. The word \"organic\"\r\nis not used in a biological sense, merely as a chemical term to describe\r\ncompounds of carbon other than carbonates, bicarbonates, and carbides.\r\nNo evidence has been found of any form of carbon other than organic,\r\nexcept for traces of carbonates.\r\n\r\nVarious studies have demonstrated possible methods of estimating the\r\ntotal amount of organic matter present in meteorites. Wiik ([ref.27])\r\nhas suggested that organics can be estimated by measuring the loss of\r\nweight on ignition. Unfortunately, this method has several disadvantages\r\nand gives very low values. Corrections must be made for weight gains due\r\nto oxidation of reduced constituents, such as FeO, Fe, Ni, and Co, and\r\nfor weight losses due to H₂O, S, etc. The water loss is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to estimate, as part comes from the combustion of organic\r\nhydrogen and part comes from the loss of mineral-bound water. The carbon\r\nalso proves difficult to combust completely, and high temperatures (over\r\n1000° C) are required for efficient conversion to CO₂.\r\n\r\nIn one study the major fraction of organic matter removed proved to have\r\na carbon content of about 47 percent ([ref.28]). Thus, if all the\r\nmeteorite carbon is present as organic matter of approximately this\r\ncomposition, total organics must be approximately double the carbon\r\ncontent; that is, 2 percent by weight carbon indicates 4 percent by\r\nweight organic matter. This estimate may be too low, for Mueller\r\n([ref.29]) has extracted a major organic fraction containing only 24\r\npercent carbon; however, this work has not been confirmed for other\r\nmeteorites.\r\n\r\nBriggs and Mamikunian ([ref.26]) have pointed out that only 25 percent\r\nof the organic matter has been extracted, and only about 5 percent of\r\nthis has been chemically characterized. Most of this 5 percent is a\r\ncomplex mixture of hydroxylated aromatic acids together with\r\nhydrocarbons of the aliphatic, napalicyclic, and aromatic series. Small\r\namounts of amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids are also present.\r\n\r\nThus far, these chemical analyses point to an abiogenic origin for the\r\norganic matter, and no conclusive evidence exists of biological activity\r\non the meteorite parent body. Microbiological investigations of samples\r\nof the carbonaceous chondrites have yielded only inconclusive evidence\r\non the problem of \"organized elements.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of these microstructures from different carbonaceous chondrites\r\nare illustrated in a paper by Mamikunian and Briggs ([ref.30]). It has\r\nbeen difficult to identify the organized structures, and most do not\r\nhave morphologies identical to known terrestrial micro-organisms.\r\nHowever, they may prove to be a variety of mineral grains, droplets of\r\norganic matter and sulfur, as well as a small amount of contaminating\r\nterrestrial debris.\r\n\r\nA comparison between the photographs of the organized elements observed\r\nin the Orgueil and Ivuna meteorites and the synthetic proteinoid\r\nmicrospheres observed by Fox ([ref.25]) point to similarities between\r\nthe two. One inference from this finding is that the organized elements\r\nin carbonaceous chondrites were never alive but, rather, should be\r\nconsidered as natural experiments in molecular evolution. Also, these\r\nsimilarities strengthen the belief that the laboratory experiments are\r\nsimilar to the natural experiments in space.\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, NASA has\r\na network to track meteors in the Midwest (South Dakota, Nebraska,\r\nKansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois). Photographs of meteor\r\ntrails are used for scientific study, and attempts are made to track and\r\nrecover meteorites for examination for traces of organic material of\r\nextraterrestrial origin.\r\n\r\nFundamental research in terrestrial organic geochemistry has shown that\r\nancient sediments and drill core samples subjected to organic analysis\r\ncontain certain stable biochemical components of past life. This\r\npreserved record is significant not only in studies of early-life\r\nchemical pathways but also in studies of the interaction of organic\r\nmatter with the geological factors. Since life on any planetary body\r\nwill interact with the soil, or surface material, it is of interest to\r\nunderstand the relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CONCEPTS FOR DETECTION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to present completely convincing evidence for the\r\nexistence of extraterrestrial life. The problem often reduces to\r\nprobabilities and to estimates of observational reliability. In almost\r\nall cases the evidence is optimistically considered strongly suggestive\r\nof—or, at the worst, not inconsistent with—the existence of\r\nextraterrestrial life. Alternatively, there is a pessimistic view that\r\nthe evidence advanced for extraterrestrial life is unconvincing,\r\nirrelevant, or has another, nonbiological explanation.\r\n\r\nIn studies of the laboratory synthesis of life-related compounds and its\r\nsignificance concerning the origin of life, several results seem to\r\nsuggest that organochemical synthesis is a general process, occurring\r\nperhaps on all planets which retain a reducing atmosphere. The\r\ntemperature ranges must be such that precursors and reaction products\r\nare not thermally dissociated. The reaction rates for the synthesis of\r\nmore complex organic molecules diminish to a negligible value when the\r\ntemperature range is below 100° C.\r\n\r\nBesides the planetary parameter of temperature, an even more fundamental\r\nnecessity for a living state exists—a liquid solvent system. For\r\nterrestrial life forms, water serves this purpose. Water has this and\r\nother properties of biological significance because of hydrogen bonding\r\nbetween adjacent molecules in the liquid state.\r\n\r\nUltraviolet radiation could serve as an extraterrestrial energy source\r\nfor organic synthesis. Research shows that, while an atmosphere is\r\nimportant, living systems can survive a wide range of ambient pressures\r\nand are little affected by a wide range of magnetic field strengths.\r\n\r\nOxygen is not a prerequisite for all living systems. While it is\r\nsometimes concluded that free oxygen is needed for all but the simplest\r\norganisms, less efficient metabolic processes coupled with higher food\r\ncollection efficiency—or a more sluggish metabolism—would seem to do\r\njust as well. Earth is the only planet in the solar system on which\r\nmolecular oxygen is known to be present in large amounts. Since plant\r\nphotosynthesis is the primary source of atmospheric oxygen, it seems\r\nsafe to infer that no other planet has large-scale plant photosynthesis\r\naccompanied by the production of oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of the existence of extraterrestrial life raises the\r\nimportant question of man’s being able to detect it. Research on\r\nextraterrestrial life detection is predicated on the ability to develop\r\nways to detect it even when the living systems are based on principles\r\nentirely different from those on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of various molecules for those of known biological\r\nsignificance to living organisms as we know them has been investigated;\r\nthe substitution of NH₂ for OH in ammonia-rich environments leads to a\r\ndiverse, and biologically very promising, chemistry. The hypothesis that\r\nsilicon may replace carbon does not support the construction of\r\nextraterrestrial genetics based on silicon compounds. (Silicon compounds\r\nparticipate in redistribution reactions which tend to maximize the\r\nrandomness of silicon bonding, and the stable retention of genetic\r\ninformation over long time periods is thus very improbable.)\r\n\r\nEvidence relevant to life on Mars has been summarized by Sagan (ch. 1 of\r\n[ref.10]):\r\n\r\n    _The Origin of Life_\r\n\r\n    In the past decade, considerable advances have been made in our\r\n    knowledge of the probable processes leading to the origin of\r\n    life on Earth. A succession of laboratory experiments has shown\r\n    that essentially all the organic building blocks of contemporary\r\n    terrestrial organisms can be synthesized by supplying energy to\r\n    a mixture of the hydrogen-rich gases of the primitive\r\n    terrestrial atmosphere. It now seems likely that the laboratory\r\n    synthesis of a self-replicating molecular system is only a short\r\n    time away from realization. The syntheses of similar systems in\r\n    the primitive terrestrial oceans must have occurred—collections\r\n    of molecules which were so constructed that, by the laws of\r\n    physics and chemistry, they forced the production of identical\r\n    copies of themselves out of the building blocks in the\r\n    surrounding medium. Such a system satisfies many of the criteria\r\n    for Darwinian natural selection, and the long evolutionary path\r\n    from molecule to advanced organism can then be understood. Since\r\n    nothing except very general primitive atmospheric conditions and\r\n    energy sources are required for such syntheses, it is possible\r\n    that similar events occurred in the early history of Mars and\r\n    that life may have come into being on that planet several\r\n    billions of years ago. Its subsequent evolution, in response to\r\n    the changing Martian environment, would have produced organisms\r\n    quite different from those which now inhabit Earth.\r\n\r\n    _Simulation Experiments_\r\n\r\n    Experiments have been performed in which terrestrial\r\n    micro-organisms have been introduced into simulated Martian\r\n    environments, with atmospheres composed of nitrogen and carbon\r\n    dioxide, no oxygen, very little water, a daily temperature\r\n    variation from +20° to -60° C, and high ultraviolet fluxes. It\r\n    was found that in every sample of terrestrial soil used there\r\n    were a few varieties of micro-organisms which easily survived on\r\n    \"Mars.\" When the local abundance of water was increased,\r\n    terrestrial micro-organisms were able to grow. Indigenous\r\n    Martian organisms may be even more efficient in coping with the\r\n    apparent rigors of their environment. These findings underscore\r\n    the necessity for sterilizing Mars entry vehicles so as not to\r\n    perform accidental biological contamination of that planet and\r\n    obscure the subsequent search for extraterrestrial life.\r\n\r\n    _Direct Searches for Life on Mars_\r\n\r\n    The early evidence for life on Mars—namely, reports of vivid\r\n    green coloration and the so-called \"canals\"—are now known to be\r\n    largely illusory. There are three major areas of contemporary\r\n    investigation: visual, polarimetric, and spectrographic.\r\n\r\n    As the Martian polar ice cap recedes each spring, a wave of\r\n    darkening propagates through the Martian dark areas, sharpening\r\n    their outlines and increasing their contrast with the\r\n    surrounding deserts. These changes occur during periods of\r\n    relatively high humidity and relatively high daytime\r\n    temperatures. A related dark collar, not due to simple dampening\r\n    of the soil, follows the edge of the polar cap in its\r\n    regression. Occasional nonseasonal changes in the form of the\r\n    Martian dark regions have been observed and sometimes cover vast\r\n    areas of surface.\r\n\r\n    Observations of the polarization of sunlight reflected from the\r\n    Martian dark areas indicate that the small particles covering\r\n    the dark areas change their size distribution in the spring,\r\n    while the particles covering the bright areas _do_ not show any\r\n    analogous changes.\r\n\r\n    Finally, infrared spectroscopic observations of the Martian dark\r\n    areas show three spectral features which, to date, seem to be\r\n    interpretable only in terms of organic matter, the particular\r\n    molecules giving rise to the absorptions being hydrocarbons and\r\n    aldehydes. [However, see p. 7 and Rea et al. ([ref.9]).]\r\n\r\n    Taken together, these observations suggest, but do not\r\n    conclusively prove, that the Martian dark areas are covered with\r\n    small organisms composed of familiar types of organic matter,\r\n    which change their size and darkness in response to the moisture\r\n    and heat of the Martian spring. We have no evidence either for\r\n    or against the existence of more advanced life forms. There is\r\n    much more information which _can_ be garnered from the ground,\r\n    balloons, Earth satellites, Mars flybys, and Mars orbiters, but\r\n    the critical tests for life on Mars can only be made from\r\n    landing vehicles equipped with experimental packages....\r\n\r\nResults of Kaplan et al. ([ref.31]) indicate that Mars has no detectable\r\noxygen, but does contain small amounts of water vapor, more abundant\r\ncarbon dioxide, possibly a large surface flux of solar ultraviolet\r\nradiation, and estimated daily temperature variations of 100° C at many\r\nlatitudes. Studies have shown that terrestrial micro-organisms can\r\nsurvive these extremely harsh environments. Furthermore, a variety of\r\nphysiological and ecological adaptations might enable the biota to\r\nsurvive the low nighttime temperatures and intracellular ice\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nLess evidence is available to support the possibility of\r\nextraterrestrial life on other planets. The Moon has no atmosphere, and\r\nextremes of temperature characterize its surface. However, the Moon\r\ncould have a layer of subsurface permafrost beneath which liquid water\r\nmight be trapped. The temperatures of these strata might be biologically\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\nStudies by Davis and Libby ([ref.32]) on the atmosphere of Jupiter\r\nsupport the possibility of the production of organic matter in its\r\natmosphere in a manner analogous to the processes which may have led to\r\nthe synthesis of organic molecules in the Earth’s early history. It is\r\ndifficult to assess the possibility that life has evolved on Jupiter\r\nduring the 4- or 5-billion-year period in which the planet has retained\r\na reducing atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe question of extraterrestrial life and of the origin of life is\r\ninterwoven. Discovery of the first and analysis of its nature may very\r\nwell elucidate the second.\r\n\r\nThe oldest form of fossil known today is that of a microscopic plant\r\nsimilar in form to common algae found in ponds and lakes. Scientists\r\nknow that similar organisms flourished in the ancient seas over 2\r\nbillion years ago. However, since algae are a relatively complex form of\r\nlife, life in some simpler form could have originated much earlier.\r\nOrganic material similar to that found in modern organisms can be\r\ndetected in these ancient deposits as well as in much older Precambrian\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the planets now have differing atmospheres, in their early\r\nstages the atmospheres of all the planets may have been essentially the\r\nsame. The most widely held theory of the origin of the solar system\r\nstates that the planets were formed from vast clouds of material\r\ncontaining the elements in their cosmic distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the synthesis of organic compounds preceding the\r\norigin of life on Earth occurred before its atmosphere was transformed\r\nfrom hydrogen and hydrides to oxygen and nitrogen. This theory is\r\nsupported by laboratory experiments of Calvin ([ref.16]), Miller\r\n([ref.33]), and Oró ([ref.34]).\r\n\r\nThe Earth’s present atmosphere consists of nitrogen and oxygen in\r\naddition to relatively small amounts of other gases; most of the oxygen\r\nis of biological origin. Some of the atmospheric gases, in spite of\r\ntheir low amounts, are crucial for life. The ultraviolet-absorbing ozone\r\nin the upper atmosphere and carbon dioxide are examples of such gases.\r\n\r\nSignificant in the search for extraterrestrial life are the data (e.g.,\r\nplanet’s temperature) transmitted by Mariner II, which was launched from\r\nCape Canaveral on August 27, 1962, and flew past Venus on December 14,\r\n1962. Mariner II’s measurements showed temperatures on the surface of\r\nVenus of the order of 800° F, too hot for life as known on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe question \"Is life limited to this planet?\" can be considered on a\r\nstatistical basis. Although the size of the sample (one planet) is\r\nsmall, the statistical argument for life elsewhere is believed by many\r\nto be very strong. While Mars is generally considered the only other\r\nlikely habitat of life in our solar system, Shapley ([ref.35]) has\r\ncalculated that more than 100 million stars have planets sufficiently\r\nsimilar in composition and environment to Earth to support life. Of\r\ncourse, yet unknown factors may significantly reduce or even eliminate\r\nthis probability.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SPACECRAFT STERILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe search for extraterrestrial life with unmanned space probes requires\r\nthe total sterilization of the landing capsule and its contents.\r\nScientists agree that terrestrial organisms released on other planets\r\nwould interfere with exobiological explorations (refs.\r\n[ref.36]-[ref.43]). Any flight that infects a planet with terrestrial\r\nlife will compromise a scientific opportunity of almost unequaled\r\nproportions. Studies on microbiological survival in simulated deep-space\r\nconditions (low temperature, high ultraviolet flux, and low dose levels\r\nof ionizing radiation) indicate that these conditions will not sterilize\r\ncontaminated spacecraft (refs. [ref.44]-[ref.48]). Furthermore, many\r\nterrestrial sporeformers and some vegetative bacteria, especially those\r\nwith anaerobic growth capabilities, readily survive in simulated Martian\r\nenvironments (refs. [ref.49]-[ref.54]). It has been estimated that a\r\nsingle micro-organism with a replication time of 30 days could, in 8\r\nyears of such replication, equal in number the bacterial population of\r\nthe Earth. This potential could result not only in competition with any\r\nMartian life, but in drastic changes in the geochemical and atmospheric\r\ncharacteristics of the planet. To avoid such a disaster, certainly the\r\nfirst, and probably many succeeding landers on Mars, must be\r\nsterile—devoid of terrestrial life ([ref.55]). Since the space\r\nenvironment will not in itself kill all life aboard, the lander must\r\nleave the Earth in a sterile condition.\r\n\r\nThe sterility of an object implies the complete absence of life. The\r\npresence of life or the lack of sterility may be proven; but the absence\r\nof life or sterility cannot be proven, for the one viable organism that\r\nnegates sterility may remain undetected. Many industrial products which\r\nmust be guaranteed as sterile cannot be tested for sterility in a\r\nnondestructive manner. A similar situation exists in determining the\r\nsterility of a spacecraft. Certification of sterility—based on\r\nexperience with the sterilizing process used, knowledge of the kinetics\r\nof the death of micro-organisms, and computation of the probability of a\r\nsurvivor from assays for sterility—is the only accurate approach to\r\ndefining the sterility of such treated items.\r\n\r\nMacroscopic life can be readily detected and kept from or removed from\r\nthe spacecraft, but the detection and removal of microscopic and\r\nsubmicroscopic life is an extremely difficult task. The destruction of\r\nmicro-organisms can be achieved by various chemical and physical\r\nprocedures. Sterilizing agents have been evaluated not only for their\r\nability to kill microbial life on surfaces and sealed inside components,\r\nbut also for the agents’ effects on spacecraft reliability as well\r\n(refs. [ref.56]-[ref.59]). Of the available agents, only heat and\r\nradiation will penetrate solid materials. Radiation is expensive,\r\nhazardous, difficult to control, and apparently damages more materials\r\nthan does heat. Heat, therefore, has been selected as the primary method\r\nof spacecraft sterilization and will be used, except in specific\r\ninstances where radiation may prove to be less detrimental to the\r\nreliability of critical parts ([ref.60]).\r\n\r\nThe sterilization of spacecraft is a difficult problem if flight\r\nreliability is not to be impaired. The development of heat-resistant\r\nparts will enable the design and manufacture of a heat-sterilizable\r\nspacecraft. Without careful microbiological monitoring of manufacture\r\nand assembly procedures, many bacteria could be trapped in parts and\r\nsubassemblies. To permit sterilization at the lowest temperature-time\r\nregimen that will insure kill of all organisms, the microbiological load\r\ninside all parts and subassemblies must be held to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe role of industrial clean rooms in reducing the biological load on\r\nspacecraft is currently being defined. NASA-supported studies indicate\r\nthat biological contamination in industrial clean rooms for extended\r\ntime periods is about 1 logarithm less (tenfold reduction), compared\r\nwith conditions in a well-operated microbiological laboratory\r\n([ref.61]). With the use of clean-room techniques and periodic\r\ndecontamination by low heat cycles or ethylene oxide treatment, it\r\nshould be possible to bring a spacecraft to the point of sterilization\r\nwith about 10⁶ organisms on board ([ref.60]).\r\n\r\nThe sterilization goal established for Mars landers is a probability of\r\nless than 1 in 10 000 (10⁻⁴) that a single viable organism will be\r\npresent on the spacecraft. Laboratory studies of the kinetics of\r\ndry-heat kill of resistant organisms show that at 135° C the number of\r\nbacterial spores can be reduced 1 logarithm (90 percent) for every 2\r\nhours of exposure (refs. [ref.58] and [ref.62]). The reduction in\r\nmicrobial count needed is the logarithm of the maximum number on the\r\nspacecraft (10⁶) plus the logarithm of the reciprocal of the probability\r\nof a survivor (10⁴), or a total of 10 logarithms of reduction in\r\nmicrobial count. Thus, with an additional 2 logarithms added as a safety\r\nfactor, a total of 12 logarithms of reduction in count has been accepted\r\nas a safe value which can be achieved by a dry-heat treatment of 135° C\r\nfor 24 hours. This is the heat cycle that is currently under study and\r\nbeing developed for use in spacecraft sterilization ([ref.60]). However,\r\nother heat treatments at temperatures as low as 105° C for periods of\r\n300 hours or longer are under study ([ref.63]).\r\n\r\nBased on results to date, it is reasonable to believe that a full\r\ncomplement of heat-sterilizable hardware will be available when needed\r\nfor planetary exploration. Every effort is being made to improve the\r\nstate of the art to a point where spacecraft can not only withstand\r\nsterilization temperatures, but will be even more reliable than the\r\npresent state-of-the-art hardware that is not heated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 3\r\n\r\n_Environmental Biology_\r\n\r\n\r\n         BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WEIGHTLESSNESS AND ZERO GRAVITY\r\n\r\nHigh priority has been given to studies of weightlessness. Gravity is\r\none of the most fundamental forces that acts on living organisms, and\r\nall life on Earth except the smallest appears to be oriented with\r\nrespect to gravity, although certain organisms are more responsive to it\r\nthan others. The gravity force on Earth is 1 g, but this force may be\r\nexperimentally varied from zero g, or weightlessness, to many thousands\r\nof g’s.\r\n\r\nZero gravity or decreased gravity occurs during freefall, in parabolic\r\ntrajectory, or during orbit around the Earth. Gravitational force\r\ndecreases by the square of the distance away from the Earth’s center. It\r\nis reduced about 5 percent at about 200 nautical miles’ altitude.\r\nGravitational force greater than 1 g can be obtained by acceleration,\r\ndeceleration, or impact. It also can be increased by using a centrifuge\r\nwhich adds a radial acceleration vector to the 1 g of Earth.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the biological effects of gravity have been studied at 1\r\ng, and experimentally, forces of many g have been produced. In addition,\r\nmodifications of the effects of the 1-g force have been induced by\r\nsuspension of the organism in water or by horizontal immobilization of\r\nan erect animal such as man. The biological effects of such modification\r\nhave been of significant value in understanding some of the possible\r\nconsequences of human exposure to the zero-g environment of space.\r\n\r\nWeightlessness in an Earth-orbiting satellite occurs when the continuous\r\nacceleration of Earth’s gravity is exactly counterbalanced by the\r\ncontinuous radial acceleration of the satellite. In such a weightless\r\nstate, organisms are liberated from their natural and continuous\r\nexertion against 1 g, but this liberation may carry with it certain\r\nserious physical penalties.\r\n\r\nSome of the physical processes which probably have the greatest\r\nbiological effects are (1) convective flow of fluid, e.g., protoplasmic\r\nstreaming, transport of nutrient materials, oxygen, waste products, and\r\nCO₂ from the immediate environment of the cell, and (2) sedimentation\r\noccurring within cells; substances of higher density sediment in a\r\ngravitational field, and those of lighter density rise. A separation of\r\nparticles of different densities probably occurs. The removal of gravity\r\nwould change a distribution of particles like mitochondria by 10 percent\r\n([ref.64]).\r\n\r\nGravity has effects on the physical processes involved in mitosis and\r\nmeiosis. Study under weightlessness might contribute to our\r\nunderstanding of the general cellular information-relay process.\r\n\r\nA gravitational effect is known in the embryonic development of the frog\r\n_Rana sylvatica_. After fertilization, the eggs rotate in the\r\ngravitational field so that the black animal hemisphere is uppermost.\r\nDevelopment becomes abnormal if this position is disturbed. If the egg\r\nis inverted following the first cleavage and held in this position, two\r\nabnormal animals result, united like Siamese twins. This phenomenon\r\nappears to be related to the gravitational separation of low- and\r\nhigh-density components of the egg. The size of the egg is about 1 to 2\r\nmm and is suspended in water of about the same density. This system is\r\nvery sensitive to gravity; and, under weightlessness, the separation of\r\ndifferent density components might be irregular, leading to aberrant\r\ndevelopment. When certain aquatic insect eggs are inverted, subsequent\r\ndevelopment results in shortened abnormal larvae.\r\n\r\nThe directional growth of plant shoots and plant roots is probably due\r\nto this sedimentation phenomenon, particularly the effect on movement of\r\nauxins ([ref.65]).\r\n\r\nFree convection flow is a major transport process, and under its\r\ninfluence the mixing of substances is much more effective than when\r\ndiffusion operates alone. Free convection flow is a macroscopic\r\nphenomenon which increases not only with g, but varies also\r\napproximately with the five-fourths power of the bulk concentration\r\ninvolved. Whether or not convection is important at the microscopic\r\nlevel remains an experimentally unsolved question. The Grashoff number\r\nlimits free convection to the macroscopic domain. It would appear in\r\nweightlessness that the contribution of free convective flow would be\r\nsmall and that only diffusion should occur. This phenomenon would cause\r\nequilibration to occur much more slowly than that occurring with free\r\nconvection and diffusion. The absence of convective transfer raises a\r\nproblem as to how nutrients may be obtained and waste products removed\r\nin living cells during weightlessness. In a liquid substrate, nutrients\r\nand oxygen would be depleted, and waste products would accumulate around\r\nthe cell.\r\n\r\nAbsence of gravity may have far-reaching consequences in the homeostatic\r\naspects of cell physiology. The outstanding characteristics of living\r\ncells which are most likely to be influenced by the absence of gravity\r\nare the ability of the cell to maintain its cytoplasmic membrane in a\r\nfunctional state, the capacity of the cell to perform its normal\r\nfunctions during the mitotic cycle, and the capacity of the cytoplasm to\r\nmaintain the constant reversibility of its sol-gel system ([ref.66]).\r\n\r\nTwo-phase systems, e.g., air-in-water and air-in-oil, possess entirely\r\ndifferent characteristics at zero g than at 1 g. These physical\r\ndifferences in phase interaction could well be suspected of interfering\r\nwith the orientation and flow pattern of cell constituents, thus\r\nhindering the cellular processes involved in the movement, metabolism,\r\nand storage of nutrients and waste.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of theoretical calculations, weightlessness can be expected\r\nto have some effect even on one individual cell if its size exceeds 10\r\nmicrons in diameter ([ref.64]). Cell colonies might be affected. In\r\nlarger cells there may be a redistribution of enzyme-forming systems\r\nwhich give rise to polarization. The low surface tension of the cell\r\nmembrane lends itself to hydrostatic stress distortion, implying an\r\nalteration in permeability and thus an almost certain alteration of cell\r\nproperties under low gravity conditions.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of gravity that affects the growth and development of\r\nliving organisms is the directionality of the gravitational field. In\r\nfact, some plants are so sensitive that they are able to direct their\r\ngrowth with as little stimulus as a 1×10⁻⁶ gravitational field.\r\nInvestigations of plant growth in altered gravitational fields are\r\nunderway at Argonne National Laboratory and Dartmouth College.\r\n\r\nThe Argonne Laboratory has designed and developed a 4-pi, or\r\nomnidirectional, clinostat. By rotating a plant so that the force of\r\ngravity is distributed evenly over all possible directions, the\r\ndirectional effects of gravity are eliminated, simulating some aspects\r\nof the zero-g state. It was shown that certain plants grew more slowly\r\nand had fewer and smaller leaves, while others had about 25 percent\r\ngreater replication of fronds and had greater elongation of certain\r\nplant parts. It will be extremely interesting to compare these effects\r\nunder zero-g conditions in orbiting spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThe effect of gravity in transporting growth hormones in plants has been\r\ndemonstrated at Dartmouth College using radiocarbon-labeled growth\r\nhormones. Plant geotropisms and growth movements have been studied and\r\nbiosatellite experiments developed.\r\n\r\nAnatomy is considered a derivative adaptation to gravity ([ref.67]). A\r\nlarge background of plant research exists on the effect of orientation\r\non plant responses. Information from clinostat experiments is considered\r\nsusceptible of extrapolation to low gravity conditions because the\r\nthreshold period for gravitational triggering is relatively long.\r\n\r\nOnce over critical minimum dimensions, the major effects of low gravity\r\nwould be assumed to occur in those heterocellular organisms that develop\r\nin more or less fixed orientation with respect to terrestrial gravity\r\nand which respond to changes in orientation with relatively long\r\ninduction periods; these are the higher plant orders. On the other\r\nextreme are the complex primates which respond rapidly, but whose\r\nmultiplicity of organs and correlative mechanisms are susceptible to\r\nmalfunction and disorganization. It may be suggested that the\r\nheterocellular lower plants and invertebrates will be less affected.\r\nPerturbations of the environment to which the experimental organism is\r\nexposed must be limited or controlled to reduce uncertainties in\r\ninterpretation of the results. At the same time, the introduction of\r\nknown perturbations may assist in isolating the effects due solely to\r\ngravity. Study of _de novo_ differentiation and other phenomena\r\nimmediately after syngamy may be of particular importance. Study of\r\nanatomical changes after exposure of the organism to low gravity is\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SPACE RADIATION¹\r\n\r\n   ¹ This section includes part of the Summary of the Panel on Radiation\r\n     Biology of the Environmental Biology Committee Space Science Board,\r\n     NAS/NRC (1963), and results of research by the Bioscience Programs,\r\n     NASA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadiation sources in space are of three types: galactic cosmic\r\nradiation, Van Allen belts, and solar flares with an intense proton\r\nflux. Cosmic radiation has higher energy levels than radiation produced\r\nby manmade accelerators.\r\n\r\nThe Panel on Radiation Biology, while recognizing the need for\r\nradiobiological studies of an applied nature with reference to manned\r\nflight programs, stated that it would be shortsighted for the United\r\nStates to confine its efforts to the solution of immediate problems\r\nsince, in the long run, successful exploration of space will be aided by\r\nthe contributions of basic research. Both the immediate biological\r\nresearch program and the continuing program for basic studies should be\r\nbuilt upon the large body of existing knowledge of radiation effects.\r\nThe attitude that all radiobiological experiments need be repeated in\r\nthe space environment should be resolutely rejected. Since fundamental\r\nradiobiology cannot be performed easily in space, it has been\r\nrecommended that, wherever possible, these investigations be carried out\r\nin ground laboratories in preference to flying laboratories.\r\n\r\nSpace environment does vary from the terrestrial environment, but the\r\nvariations are not so great as to lead to the expectation of strikingly\r\ndifferent biological effects of radiation in space. However, it is\r\nconceivable that radiations whose effects are well known under\r\nterrestrial conditions may have some unsuspected biological effects when\r\ncombined with unusual features of the space environment: e.g., zero g.\r\nPrevious space radiobiological studies have depended solely on very low\r\nand inaccurately measured doses of ambient space radiation. It has been\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the observed response levels and the\r\nrandom noise; thus, experiments have been inconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiological Effects of Heavy Ions and Mesons\r\n\r\nThe biological effects of heavy ions (especially Z>2) and mesons are of\r\nspecific interest to space radiobiology.\r\n\r\n\r\nControlled Radiobiological Experiments in Space\r\n\r\nThere is the remote possibility that the radiobiological response may be\r\nmodified by factors as yet unknown and perhaps not susceptible to\r\nterrestrial study. Experiments have been designed to settle this matter\r\nincluding the exposure of biological materials during space flight which\r\nmeet the following criteria of reliability: (1) the use of well-known\r\nbiological systems, e.g., mutation induction or chromosome breakage; (2)\r\nthe use of a sufficient number of individuals in the experiment to\r\nguarantee statistical precision on the results; (3) the exposure of the\r\nsystem to known quantities and qualities of radiation; (4) the use of\r\nadequate controls.\r\n\r\nHigh-altitude balloon ascents of the 1930’s initiated study of the\r\nbiological effects of cosmic rays. They were limited to the exploration\r\nof secondary cosmic radiation effects. After World War II, the research\r\nextended to the use of V-2 rockets fired from the White Sands Proving\r\nGround. Interest returned to balloons and a significant program was\r\nunderway by 1950, first using mice and then hamsters, fruit flies, cats,\r\nand dogs. These flights gave no evidence of radiation damage. However,\r\nit was realized that the flights were too far south to obtain a\r\nsignificant exposure, and more northerly flights began in 1953. Mice and\r\nguinea pigs were flown on these later flights. Chase ([ref.68]) showed\r\nthe most unequivocal results to that time, a statistically significant\r\nincrease in light hairs on black animals and the streaks of white hair\r\nup to 10 times wider than expected. Brain lesions were detected in the\r\nguinea pigs flown on Man High in 1957. Many other types of biological\r\nmaterial were sent aloft in an effort to further corroborate existing\r\ninformation and to investigate genetic and developmental effects of\r\ncosmic radiation.\r\n\r\nFrom the earlier V-2 rocket flights to the Jupiter missile launchings of\r\nthe monkeys Able and Baker, cosmic-ray research was continued, but the\r\nshort flight durations of these vehicles did not provide substantial\r\ninformation. The USAF Discoverer satellite program has given impetus to\r\ncosmic-ray research and provided for longer \"staytimes.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult to separate radiation effects from other\r\nspace-flight factors: therefore, some of the alterations observed are\r\nstill subject to debate. Vibration, acceleration, and weightlessness\r\nappear to be the three most important additional parameters.\r\nMeasurements of radiation dosage have been made by chemical and\r\nphotographic dosimetry, ion chambers, and biological dosimetry. All\r\nevidence to date indicates that radiation exposure levels are not\r\nhazardous to man at present orbital altitudes up to 200 nautical miles.\r\nMost biological materials flown so far have been for the express purpose\r\nof investigating space-radiation levels and effects. The biological\r\nmaterials have ranged from tissue cultures to entire organisms and from\r\nphage and bacterial cells to man. The studies have required much of the\r\nspace and weight resources allotted biology by the U.S.S.R. and the\r\nUnited States. They have been accompanied by ground-based controls.\r\n\r\nThe Vostok series provided the following data:\r\n\r\n  (1) A small, but statistically significant, increase was observed in\r\n      the percentage of chromosome aberrations in the rootlet cells of\r\n      air-dried wheat and pea seeds after germination. In this case\r\n      only, the increase did not depend on flight duration.\r\n  (2) Lysogenic bacteria exhibited an increase of genetic alterations\r\n      and increased phage production. Length of flight was associated\r\n      with increased bacteriophage production by the lysogenic bacteria.\r\n      There was an increase of recessive lethals coupled with\r\n      nonconvergence of chromosomes (sex linked) in the fruit fly. A\r\n      stimulation of cell division in wheat and pea seeds was observed.\r\n      Cultures of human cells exposed to space-flight factors did not\r\n      differ significantly from terrestrial controls with respect to\r\n      such indicators as proliferation rate, percentage of mortality and\r\n      morphological, antigenic, and cultural properties. Repeated\r\n      flights of the identical HeLa cells revealed that there was a\r\n      longer latent period for restoration of growth capacity than in\r\n      cells carried into space once or not flown at all.\r\n  (3) The most definite radiation effects observed were only revealed in\r\n      genetic tests. No harmful influence on those characteristics\r\n      affecting the viability of the organism has been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Discoverer series launched from the west coast had a few\r\nsuccessful flights incorporating organisms. With severe environmental\r\nstress and long recovery times, data on radiation exposure were\r\nequivocal up to Discoverer XVII and XVIII when cultures of human tissue\r\nwere flown, recovered, and assessed for radiation exposure effects.\r\nComparison with ground-based controls revealed no measurable\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nRadiation dosimetry from the Mercury series established that minimal\r\nexposures were encountered at those orbital altitudes. A typical example\r\nis the MA-8 flight of W. M. Schirra, Jr., during which the body surface\r\ndosage was less than 30 millirads.\r\n\r\nNASA has supported fundamental radiation studies at the Oak Ridge\r\nNational Laboratory and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. Emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on the biological effects of high-energy proton radiation\r\nand particulate radiation from accelerators.\r\n\r\nAt the NASA Ames Research Center extensive fundamental studies are being\r\ncarried out on the effects of radiation, especially in the nervous\r\nsystem. It has been demonstrated that deposits accumulate in the brain\r\nfollowing exposure to large doses of ionizing particle radiation as well\r\nas after X-irradiation. These deposits, referred to as a \"chemical\r\nlesion,\" result from an accumulation of glycogen. The formation of these\r\ndeposits during exposure to large doses of X-irradiation was not\r\nincreased in environments of 99.5 percent oxygen and increased\r\natmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SIMULATION OF PLANETARY (MARTIAN) ENVIRONMENTS\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to simulate to some degree the various\r\nparameters of the Martian environment, such as atmospheric composition,\r\npressure, radiation flux, temperatures, and the day-night as well as\r\nseasonal cycles. Certain factors for Mars cannot yet be simulated, such\r\nas soil composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and electrical\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nCaution is required in interpreting all simulation experiments. How\r\nEarth organisms respond to simulated Martian environments probably has\r\nnothing to do with life on Mars, but these experiments may show whether\r\nor not anything in the environment of Mars makes life as we know it\r\nimpossible. We must expect that on Mars, life will have evolved and have\r\nadapted over long periods of time under conditions which are quite\r\ndifferent from conditions on Earth. The simulation experiments also\r\nprovide some information about the possibility of contaminating the\r\nplanet Mars, or any planet, with organisms from Earth. In addition, they\r\ngive us some clues about the possibilities of adaptation and evolution\r\nof life under these conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, if life has developed on Mars, we\r\nexpect it to have evolved at least to a microbial stage. On Earth,\r\nmicro-organisms are the most ubiquitous and numerous forms of life. This\r\nfact should be considered in studying extraterrestrial bodies.\r\n\r\nMicro-organisms have been selected as the best test organisms, and\r\nbacteria and fungi have been used because they are durable and easy to\r\ngrow. Also, because of their rapid growth, many generations can be\r\nstudied in a relatively short period of time. The organisms include\r\nchemoautotrophic bacteria, which are able to synthesize their cell\r\nconstituents from carbon dioxide by energy derived from inorganic\r\nreactions; anaerobic bacteria, which grow only in the absence of\r\nmolecular oxygen; photoautotrophic plants such as algae, lichens, and\r\nmore complex seed plants; and small terrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nOrganisms have been collected from tundra, desert, hot springs, alpine,\r\nand saline habitats to obtain species with specialized capabilities to\r\nconserve water, balance osmotic discrepancies, store gases, accommodate\r\nto temperature extremes, and otherwise meet stresses. An attempt is made\r\nin these simulation experiments to extend these processes across the\r\npossible overlapping microenvironments which Earth and Mars may share.\r\n\r\nScientists have developed various special environmental simulators,\r\nincluding \"Mars jars\" and \"Marsariums.\" These have made possible\r\ncontrolled temperatures, atmospheres, pressures, water activities, and\r\nsoil conditions for duplicating assumed Martian surface. A complex\r\nsimulator, developed by Young et al. ([ref.52]), reproduces the\r\nformation of a permafrost layer with some water tied up in the form of\r\nice beneath the soil surface. This simulator serves as a model to study\r\nthe wave of darkening, thus supporting the hypothesis that the\r\npole-to-equator wave of darkening is correlated with the availability of\r\nsubsurface water. The simulator is a heavily insulated 2-cu-ft capacity\r\nchamber with an internal pressure of 0.1 atm. The chamber contains a\r\nsoil mixture of limonite and sand and an atmosphere of carbon dioxide\r\nand nitrogen. With the use of a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger at one\r\nend and an external battery of infrared lamps at the other end, the\r\ntemperature simulates that of Mars from pole to equator. Thermocouples\r\nthroughout the soil monitor the temperatures in the chamber.\r\n\r\nZhukova and Kondratyev ([ref.69]) designed a structure measuring\r\n100×150×180 cm. Micro-organisms were placed at the surface of a copper\r\nbar made in a special groove separated by glass cloth. Copper was\r\nselected as one of the best heat-conduction materials permitting a rapid\r\nchange of temperature. The lower end of the bar was immersed into a\r\nmixture of dry ice and ethyl alcohol, which made it possible to create a\r\ntemperature of -60° C. Heating was performed by an incandescent spiral.\r\n\r\nAs the knowledge concerning the Martian environment becomes more\r\nrefined, scientists can more accurately simulate this environment under\r\ncontrolled conditions in the laboratory. Determination of the effects of\r\nthe Martian environment on Earth organisms will permit better\r\ntheorization on the forms of life we might find on Mars and will permit\r\nus to estimate the potential survival of Earth contaminants on Mars.\r\n\r\nHowever, until the environmental conditions of Mars are defined more\r\naccurately, the experiments must be changed continually to fit newly\r\ndetermined conditions. Therefore, existing simulation data are made less\r\nvalid for comparison. The data resulting from the simulation experiments\r\nfor Mars have been compiled in table II, and the experiments are\r\nsummarized below.\r\n\r\nThe earliest simulation studies were carried out by the Air Force, and\r\nthe studies during the past 6 years have been supported by NASA.\r\nRecently, these studies have received less support or have been\r\nterminated in favor of critical studies on the effects of biologically\r\nimportant environmental extreme factors on Earth organisms. These\r\ncritical studies permit establishing the extreme environmental factor\r\nparameters in which Earth life can grow or survive. These data will have\r\nvaluable application to the consideration of life on any planet, to the\r\ndesign of life-detection instruments, to the sterilization of space\r\nvehicles, and to the problem of contamination of planets.\r\n\r\nSome exploratory experimental studies are in progress to study the\r\ncapabilities of organisms to grow under the assumed conditions on\r\nJupiter. These include studies at high pressure with liquid ammonia,\r\nmethane, and other reducing compounds.\r\n\r\nEarly experiments simulating Martian conditions using soil bacteria were\r\ncarried out by Davis and Fulton ([ref.70]) at the Air Force School of\r\nAviation Medicine, San Antonio, Tex. Mixed populations of soil bacteria\r\nwere put in \"Mars jars\" with the following conditions: 65-mm Hg\r\npressure, 1 percent water or less, nitrogen atmosphere, sandstone-lava\r\nsoil, and a temperature day-night cycle of +25° to -25° C. The moisture\r\nwas controlled by desiccating the soil and adding a given amount of\r\nwater. Experiments, conducted up to 10 months, demonstrated that\r\nobligate aerobes died quickly. The anaerobes and sporeformers survived.\r\nAlthough a small increase in the total number of organisms indicated\r\ngrowth, the increases in the number of bacteria may have been due to\r\nbreaking up clumps of dirt.\r\n\r\nRoberts and Irvine ([ref.71]) reported that, in a simulated Martian\r\nenvironment, colony counts of a sporeforming bacterium, _Bacillus\r\ncereus_, increased when 8 percent moisture was added. Moisture was\r\nconsidered more important than temperature or atmospheric gases inasmuch\r\nas a simulated Martian microenvironment containing 8 percent moisture\r\npermitted germination and growth of endospores of _Clostridium\r\nsporogenes_. Increases in colony counts of _Bacillus cereus_ appeared to\r\nbe influenced by temperature cycling ([ref.72]).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Table II.—_Survival and Growth of Organisms in Simulated Planetary\r\n

([ref.49]).\r\nThey showed that the encapsulated facultative anaerobe, _Klebsiella\r\npneumoniae_, survived under simulated Martian atmosphere for 6 to 8\r\nmonths, but were less virulent than the freshly isolated organisms.\r\nSpores of the anaerobe _Clostridium botulinum_ survived 10 months in the\r\nsimulator. Hagen et al. ([ref.53]) found that the addition of moisture\r\nto dry-simulated Martian soil did not improve the survival of _Bacillus\r\nsubtilis_ or _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. _Bacillus cereus_ spores\r\nsurvived, with added organic medium plus moisture, but no germination of\r\nthe spores resulted.\r\n\r\nHawrylewicz et al. ([ref.49]) put rocks from Antarctica bearing various\r\nlichens in simulated Martian conditions in a large desiccator. They\r\nfound that the algal portion of a lichen, _Trebouxia erici_, showed only\r\nslight resistance to the Martian environment. They also pointed out the\r\neffect moisture had on the physical condition of lichens. The\r\nundersurface of a lichen has great water-absorbing capability, and the\r\nslightest amount of moisture on a rock surface is absorbed by the lichen\r\nwhich can turn green in 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nScher et al. ([ref.51]) exposed desert soils to simulated environmental\r\nconditions and diurnal cycles of Mars. The atmosphere consisted of 95\r\npercent nitrogen and 5 percent carbon dioxide (no oxygen) and was dried,\r\nusing calcium sulfate as a desiccant. The total atmospheric pressure was\r\n0.1 atm. The temperature ranged from -60° to +20° C in 24-hour cycles.\r\nOne hour was spent at the maximum and at the minimum temperatures. The\r\nchambers were irradiated with ultraviolet, 2537 Å, with a dose of 10⁹\r\nergs/cm², which is comparable to a daily dose found on Mars, and easily\r\nexceeds the mean lethal dose for unprotected bacteria. Soil aliquots\r\nwere removed weekly and incubated at 30° C. The scoring was done both\r\naerobically and anaerobically. Sporeforming obligate and facultative\r\nanaerobes, including _Clostridium_, _Bacillus_, and _Planosarcina_, and\r\nnonsporeforming facultative anaerobes, including _Pseudomonas_ and\r\n_Rhodopseudomonas_, were found. The experimental chambers were frozen\r\nand thawed cyclically up to 6 months. Organisms that were able to\r\nsurvive the first freeze-thaw cycle were able to survive the entire\r\nexperiment. The ultraviolet irradiation did not kill subsurface\r\norganisms, and a thin layer of soil served as an ultraviolet shield. All\r\nof the samples showed survivors.\r\n\r\nYoung et al. ([ref.52]) assumed that water is present on Mars, at least\r\nin microenvironments, and that nutrients would be available. The primary\r\nobjective of their experiments was to determine the likelihood of\r\ncontaminating Mars with Earth organisms should a space probe from Earth\r\nencounter an optimum microenvironment in terms of water and nutrients.\r\nThe experiments used bacteria in liquid nutrient media. The environment\r\nconsisted of a carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, and the temperature\r\ncycling was -70° to +25° C, with a maximum time above freezing of 4½\r\nhours. _Aerobacter aerogenes_ and _Pseudomonas sp._ grew in nutrient\r\nmedium under Martian freezing and thawing cycles. Atmospheric pressure\r\nwas not a significant factor in the growth of bacteria under these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSilverman et al. ([ref.47]) studied bacteria and a fungus under\r\nextreme—but not \"Martian\"—conditions. Spores of five test organisms (_B.\r\nsubtilis_ var. _niger_, _B. megaterium_, _B. stearothermophilus_,\r\n_Clostridium sporogenes,_ and _Aspergillus niger_) and soils were\r\nexposed while under ultrahigh vacuum to temperatures of from -190° to\r\n+170° C for 4 to 5 days. Up to 25° C there was no loss in viability; at\r\nhigher temperatures, differences in resistivity were observed. At 88° C,\r\nonly _B. subtilis_ and _A. niger_ survived in appreciable numbers; at\r\n107° C, only _A. niger_ spores survived; none were recoverable after\r\nexposure to 120° C. _B. subtilis_ survived at atmospheric pressure and\r\n90° C for 5 days, but none of the other spores were viable alter 2 days.\r\nFour groups of soil organisms (mesophilic, aerobic, and anaerobic\r\nbacteria, molds, and actinomycetes) were similarly tested in the vacuum\r\nchamber. From one sample only actinomycetes survived 120° C, while one\r\nother soil sample yielded viable bacteria after exposure to 170° C.\r\nSeveral organisms resisted 120° C in ultrahigh vacuum for 4 to 5 days.\r\nWhen irradiated with gamma rays from a cobalt 60 source, differences\r\nwere observed between vacuum-dried spores irradiated while under vacuum\r\nand those exposed to air immediately before irradiation. A reduction of\r\nfrom one-third to one-ninth of the viability of spores irradiated in\r\nvacuum occurred with vacuum-treated spores irradiated in air.\r\n\r\nSiegel et al. ([ref.73]), in approximate simulations of Martian\r\nenvironments, studied tolerances of certain seed plants, such as\r\ncucumbers, corn, and winter rye, to low temperatures and lowered oxygen\r\ntensions. Lowered oxygen tensions enhanced the resistance of seedlings,\r\nparticularly cucumber and rye to freezing, and lowered the minimum\r\ntemperature required for germination. Germination of seeds in the\r\nabsence of liquid water has also been studied. In this case, seeds of\r\nxerophytes have been suspended in air at 75-mm Hg pressure above water.\r\nThe air was thus saturated. Germination was slow but did occur.\r\n\r\nSiegel et al. (refs. [ref.73] and [ref.74]) found that the growth rate\r\nof several higher plants was enhanced by certain gases usually thought\r\nto be toxic, such as N₂O. This finding is significant inasmuch as the\r\npresence of nitrogen oxides in the Martian atmosphere has been cited as\r\nevidence for the nonexistence of plants on that planet by Kiess et al.\r\n([ref.75]). Exploratory survival tests showed that various mature\r\nplants, as well as the larvae, pupae, and adult specimens of a\r\ncoleopteran insect, were undamaged when exposed to at least 40 hours of\r\nan atmosphere containing 96.5 percent N₂O, 0.7 percent O₂, and 2.8\r\npercent N₂.\r\n\r\nLichens are of interest because of their ability to survive and thrive\r\nunder extreme environmental conditions on Earth. Biological activity of\r\nslow-growing lichens was detected by metabolic gas exchange, CO₂\r\ndetection being especially convenient. Siegel points out that this\r\nmethod is sensitive and nondestructive, to be preferred to staining\r\ntechniques, which at present are limited because they are only\r\nsemiquantitative, subjective, and destructive of the lichen.\r\n\r\nA Russian study of simulated planetary environments has been performed\r\nwith good simulation but for periods of only 2 to 6 hours. Comments on\r\nsimulation experiments made by Zhukova and Kondratyev ([ref.69]) are\r\npresented as follows:\r\n\r\n    On the basis of modern conceptions on Martian conditions it is\r\n    difficult to imagine that higher forms of animals or plants\r\n    exist on the planet. A Martian change of seasons similar to that\r\n    of our planet empowers us to think that there is a circulation\r\n    of an organic substance on Mars, which cannot exist without\r\n    participation of microbic forms of life. Microorganisms are the\r\n    most probable inhabitants of Mars although the possibility is\r\n    not excluded that their physiological features will be very\r\n    specific. That is why the solution of the problem concerning the\r\n    character of life on Mars is of exceptional interest. But still\r\n    the answer to this question can be verified only by simulating\r\n    Martian conditions, taking into account the information obtained\r\n    from astrophysicists.\r\n\r\n    Experiments aimed at creating artificial Martian climatic\r\n    conditions have been started quite recently; their number is not\r\n    large since they cannot be combined with the results of numerous\r\n    experiments investigating the effect of extreme factors on\r\n    microorganisms. The result of the effect of such physicochemical\r\n    parameters of the medium as pressure, sharp temperature changes,\r\n    the absence of oxygen and insolation, depends on their\r\n    combination and simultaneity. These examples convincingly show\r\n    that while simulating Martian conditions one should strive to\r\n    the most comprehensive complex of simultaneously acting factors.\r\n    The creation of individual climatic parameters acting\r\n    successively leads to absolutely different, often opposite\r\n    results. It should be mentioned also that refusal to imitate\r\n    insolation and the performance of experiments with specimens of\r\n    soil which itself has protective effect on cells of\r\n    microorganisms, but not with pure culture of bacteria, are usual\r\n    shortcomings in the bulk of studies on this problem.\r\n\r\nIt appears that organisms from Earth might survive in large numbers when\r\nintroduced to Martian environment. Whether these organisms will be\r\ncapable of growth and explosive contamination of the planet in a\r\nbiological sense or not is highly questionable. The likelihood of an\r\norganism from Earth finding ideal conditions for growth on Mars seems\r\nextremely low. However, the likelihood of an organism from Earth serving\r\nas a contaminant for any life-detection device flown to Mars for the\r\npurpose of searching out carbon-based life is considerably higher. The\r\nchance that life has originated and evolved on Mars is a completely\r\nseparate question and much more difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to attempt to determine possible evolutionary\r\ntrends which might occur on a planet by means of selection of organisms\r\nin a simulated planetary environment. Rapid genetic selection combined\r\nwith radiation and chemicals to speed up mutation rate under these\r\nconditions should reveal possible evolutionary trends under the\r\nplanetary environmental conditions. This could be attempted after the\r\nplanetary environments are more accurately defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n         EXTREME AND LIMITING ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS OF LIFE\r\n\r\nThe question of the existence of extraterrestrial life is one of the\r\nmost important and interesting biological questions facing mankind and\r\nhas been the subject of much controversial discussion and conjecture.\r\nMany of the quantitative, and even qualitative, environmental\r\nconstituents of the planets also are still subjects of controversy and\r\nspeculation. Best guesses about a relatively unknown planetary\r\nenvironment, combined with lack of information about the capabilities of\r\nEarth life to grow in extreme environments, do not provide the basis for\r\nmaking informed scientific estimates.\r\n\r\nLife on Earth is usually considered to be relatively limited in its\r\nability to grow, reproduce, or survive in extreme environmental\r\nconditions. While many common plants and animals (including man) are\r\nquite sensitive to, or incapable of, surviving severe chemical and\r\nphysical changes or extremes of environment, a large number of\r\nmicro-organisms are highly adapted and flourish in environments usually\r\nconsidered lethal. Certain chemoautotrophic bacteria require high\r\nconcentrations of ammonia, methane, or other chemicals to grow.\r\nAnaerobic bacteria grow only in the absence of oxygen.\r\n\r\nBesides adapting to the extremes of environments on Earth, life is also\r\ncapable of growing and reproducing under extreme environmental\r\nconditions not normally encountered: e.g., from a few rad of radiation\r\nin normal habitats to 10⁶ or more rad from artificial sources, from 0.5\r\ngauss of Earth magnetism to 167 000 gauss in manmade magnetic fields,\r\nand from 1-g force of gravity to 110 000 g. The extreme ranges of\r\nphysical and chemical environmental factors for growth, reproduction,\r\nand survival for Earth micro-organisms are phenomenally large.\r\n\r\nLife is ubiquitous on Earth and is found in almost every possible\r\nenvironment, including the most severe habitats, from the bottom of the\r\nocean to the highest mountain tops and from cold Arctic habitats to hot\r\nsprings, as well as in volcanic craters, deep wells, salt flats, and\r\nmountain snowfields. Earth life has become adapted to, and has invaded,\r\nnearly every habitat, no matter how severe. The physiological and\r\nmorphological adaptations of life are exceedingly diverse and complex.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the extreme parameters or ranges of the physical and\r\nchemical environmental factors permitting growth, reproduction, and\r\nother physiological processes of Earth organisms have not been\r\ncritically compiled. A partial compilation of certain selected\r\nenvironmental factors has been made by Vallentyne ([ref.76]). A\r\ncompilation of available published data on certain environmental\r\nextremes, particularly from recent NASA-supported research (compiled by\r\nDale W. Jenkins, in press), is presented in tables III to VI. These data\r\ncan serve as a starting point for a more intensive literature review by\r\nspecialists, critical evaluation, standardization of end points, and\r\nespecially to point out areas where critical experimentation is urgently\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThis critical compilation involves a review of a very broad and complex\r\nrange of subjects involved in many different disciplines with widely\r\nscattered literature. Since the effects of many of the specific\r\nenvironmental factors are harmful, it is difficult to select a point on\r\na scale from no effect to death and use some criteria to say that normal\r\nor even minimal growth and reproduction are occurring. The effects of\r\nenvironmental factors are dependent on (1) the specific factor, times,\r\n(2) the concentration or energy, times, (3) the time of exposure or\r\napplication of the factor. Many reports, especially older ones, do not\r\ngive all of the necessary data to permit proper evaluation. A\r\ncomplicating factor is that the effect of each factor depends on the\r\nother factors before, during, and after its application. The condition\r\nof the organism itself is a great variable. Proper evaluation requires\r\nthe critical review by a variety of biological specialists, physicists,\r\nand chemists.\r\n\r\nTo determine the potential of Earth organisms to survive or grow under\r\nother planetary environmental conditions, a number of experiments have\r\nbeen carried out attempting to simulate planetary environments,\r\nespecially of Mars, as reviewed previously. While the results are of\r\nreal interest, they do not provide much basic information. Further, as\r\nthe Martian environment is more accurately defined, the experimental\r\nconditions are changed. In addition, some experimenters have altered\r\ncertain factors, such as water content, to allow for potential\r\nmicrohabitats or for areas which might contain more water at certain\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Table III.—_Extreme Physical Environmental Factors_\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Physical

launching of the\r\nsecond Earth satellite Sputnik II, the first vehicle to carry life into\r\norbit around the Earth. This accomplishment was preceded by the\r\npioneering work of Henry et al. ([ref.77]), in which animals were\r\nexposed briefly to low-gravity states in Aerobee rockets. A\r\nmotion-picture camera photographed the behavior of two white mice in\r\nrotating drums during this series of flights, which marked the first\r\ntime that simple psychological tests were made on animals in the\r\nweightless condition. While this behavioral experiment was relatively\r\nsimple, it provided the basic concepts for recent studies which involved\r\nrotation of animals during the weightless state. Subsequent flights such\r\nas Project MIA (Mouse-in-Able) reflected a preoccupation with\r\nphysiologic measures (refs. [ref.78] and [ref.79]), although the flights\r\nof Baker and Able included preflight and postflight performance studies\r\n([ref.80]). Able’s behavior was recorded in detail on in-flight film,\r\nbut none of the behavior was programed or under experimental control.\r\n\r\nThe first flights in which behavior or performance was explicitly\r\nprogramed were those of Sam and Miss Sam in flights of the Little Joe\r\nrocket with the Mercury capsule, launched from Wallops Island in 1959\r\nand 1960 ([ref.81]). The first major space achievement in the behavioral\r\nsciences was the successful in-flight measurement of the behavior of the\r\nchimpanzee Ham in early 1961, in which the pretrained animal performed\r\nthroughout the flight. The second achievement along these lines was in\r\n1962 when the chimpanzee Enos made several orbits around Earth and\r\nperformed continuously on a complex behavioral task. The tasks which the\r\nanimals performed during these flights have been described in detail by\r\nBelleville et al. ([ref.82]), and the results of the in-flight\r\nperformance have been presented by Henry and Mosely ([ref.83]). These\r\nearly flights provided much of the technological framework on which\r\ncurrent biological experiments on organisms during flights of extended\r\nduration are based. Due largely to the efforts of Grunzke (refs.\r\n[ref.84] and [ref.85]), the apparatus needed to sustain animals during\r\nspace flight, such as zero-g watering and feeding devices, are now\r\ncommonplace ([ref.86]). Advanced systems of programing stimulus\r\npresentations and recording responses, developed for Project Mercury,\r\nmay now be seen in many basic research laboratories throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSeveral other noteworthy advances have been made as an outgrowth of the\r\nMercury animal flights. Immediately before the orbital flight MA-5, in\r\nwhich the chimpanzee Enos was employed, it was unexpectedly found that\r\nthis 5-year-old animal was hypertensive. Subsequent centrifuge studies\r\nshowed that its vascular responses exceeded those of a control group.\r\nConsideration of the animal’s preflight experience led to speculation\r\nconcerning the origin of this hypertension. An explanation of the\r\nhigh-blood-pressure responses detected in Enos has been pursued by\r\nMeehan et al. ([ref.87]). Persistent hypertension has been produced in\r\nother laboratory chimpanzees restrained in the same manner as those\r\nparticipating in space flight and exposed to demanding performance\r\ntasks, a demonstration which has important implications for prolonged\r\nmanned space flight and for cardiovascular medicine in general.\r\n\r\nStudies more directly concerned with behavior and performance have been\r\nextended from those of Project Mercury. These extensions have been in\r\nthe following directions: (1) the establishment and maintenance of\r\ncomplex behavioral repertoires under conditions of full environmental\r\ncontrol, (2) the refinement of behavioral techniques for assessing\r\nsensory and motor processes, and (3) the maintenance of sustained\r\nperformance under conditions of long-term isolation and confinement and\r\npreliminary extension of such experimental analysis to man.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies with primate subjects, including several at Ames\r\nResearch Center, have been devoted to developing methods for maintaining\r\noptimum performance in environments with limited sources of stimulation.\r\nMonkeys, baboons, and chimpanzees, for example, have been isolated for\r\nperiods of longer than 2 years with no decrement in performance on\r\ncomplicated behavioral tasks ([ref.88]). The behavioral techniques used\r\nin these studies are closely related to those employed on human subjects\r\nunder NASA sponsorship at the University of Maryland ([ref.89]). The\r\nessence of these techniques is in the proper programing of environmental\r\nstimuli ([ref.90]). It is not sufficient to provide the subject with his\r\nphysiological requirements for survival, but he must be given the\r\npsychological motivation for using these provisions. This statement, of\r\ncourse, is an oversimplification of the problem, but it serves to\r\nillustrate the essence of these experimental programs.\r\n\r\nGravity has long been known as one of the major factors influencing\r\nvarious life processes and the orientation of both plants and animals.\r\nOne of the most challenging problems of space research has been to\r\ndefine this influence more precisely. Related to the effect of gravity\r\non living processes is the problem of the effects of weightlessness. Of\r\nparticular interest to psychologists are the possible modifications an\r\naltered gravitational environment might produce in behavioral patterns\r\nbasic to the animal’s maintenance and survival, such as eating, sensory\r\nand discriminative processes, development and maturation, and learning\r\ncapacity ([ref.91]).\r\n\r\nOne prominent method of studying gravitational effects is to simulate an\r\nincrease in gravity by centrifugation. Smith et al. ([ref.92]) and\r\nWinget et al. ([ref.93]) have investigated the effects of long-term\r\nacceleration on birds, primarily chickens, while Wunder (refs. [ref.94]\r\nand [ref.95]) and his coworkers (refs. [ref.96]-[ref.99]) have used\r\nfruit flies, mice, rats, hamsters, and turtles. The general findings are\r\nthat, when animals are subjected to a prolonged period of acceleration\r\nof moderate intensity, they exhibit decreased growth, delayed\r\nmaturation, and an increase in the size of certain muscles and organs,\r\ndependent on the species. With regard to the decreased growth effect,\r\nthe data of these investigators show some exceptions. When the\r\ngravitational increase is kept below a certain limit, growth was greater\r\nthan that of controls in the fruit fly, turtle, mouse, and chicken. The\r\nlimit below which enhancement of growth was observed varied with the\r\nspecies studied.\r\n\r\nThe data on food intake do not present a consistent picture. Wunder\r\n([ref.94]) found that food intake in accelerated mice was markedly\r\nreduced from that of nonaccelerated control animals. Smith, however,\r\nfound that in chickens, food intake increased up to 36 percent over\r\ncontrols and has derived an exponential relation between food intake and\r\nacceleration. After six generations of selective breeding, Smith has\r\nproduced a strain of chickens better adapted to prolonged exposure to\r\nhigh g.\r\n\r\nA very relevant finding of their research with birds was that exposure\r\nto chronic acceleration in some way appears to interfere with\r\nhabituation to rotatory stimulation. Chickens who were being subjected\r\nto chronic acceleration were given repeated rotatory stimulation tests\r\nto estimate their labyrinthine sensitivity. This study revealed that\r\ncentrifuged animals showed a marked reduction in labyrinthine\r\nsensitivity. This result appeared to persist after the acceleration was\r\nterminated. In animals who developed gait or postural difficulties as a\r\nresult of acceleration, there was no evidence of a postnystagmus in\r\nresponse to the rotatory stimulation test, which the investigators point\r\nout may be evidence of a lesion in the labyrinth or its neural pathways.\r\n\r\nSmith has implicated social factors as interfering with acceleration\r\neffects. His subjects were typically accelerated four or six to a cage.\r\nWhen groups were mixed midway through the experiment, they exhibited a\r\nhigher mortality rate and incidence of acceleration symptoms than did\r\ngroups whose constituency remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nAt the U.S. Naval School of Aerospace Medicine, numerous studies have\r\nbeen conducted on the effects of slow rotation on the behavior and\r\nphysiology of humans and animals ([ref.100]). Rotation initially\r\nproduces decrements in performance, but adaptation to a rotating\r\nenvironment ensues quite rapidly (refs. [ref.101]-[ref.103]). Perceptual\r\ndistortion, nystagmus, nausea, and other signs of discomfort are common\r\nresponses to slow rotation. These symptoms are generally reduced with\r\ncontinued exposure (adaptation). Interestingly, however, adaptation is\r\ndelayed when the subjects are exposed to a fixed reference outside their\r\nrotating environment.\r\n\r\nAt NASA-Ames, rodents have been used in experiments by Weissman and\r\nSeldeen to delimit the stimulus effects of rotation. In these\r\nexperiments the subjects must discriminate between different speeds of\r\nrotation in order to obtain food reinforcement. The results thus far\r\nprovide evidence that these animals are capable of discriminating\r\nbetween the different speeds at which they are being rotated. The range\r\nof speeds studied was 0-25 rpm, with tests of discrimination being made\r\nat intervals of less than 5 rpm. Experiments such as these will lead to\r\nthe development of techniques for measuring rotational sensitivity in\r\nmany species, including man.\r\n\r\nThe optimum configuration of manned spacecraft will depend, in part,\r\nupon biomedical considerations. A voluminous literature now exists on\r\nthe possible hazards to man of prolonged exposure to zero-g conditions.\r\nShould prolonged weightlessness prove to be a serious detriment to\r\nhealth, consideration must be given to design concepts which provide\r\nartificial gravity.\r\n\r\nNo data exist on the minimum gravity requirements necessary to sustain\r\nbasic biological functions for extended periods. A limit of 0.2 g has\r\nbeen given as the lower level at which man can walk unaided ([ref.104]).\r\nIt has also been recommended that angular velocity be maintained\r\nat the lowest possible level in order to minimize the occurrence of\r\nvestibular disturbances. These recommendations are based on human-factor\r\nrequirements, rather than upon biological considerations, which may\r\nsignificantly modify these values. In recent studies, a technique has\r\nbeen devised which promises to provide reliable criteria for biological\r\nacceptability, since it is based on fundamental biological and\r\nbehavioral principles.\r\n\r\nAs animals progress up the evolutionary stale, their survival depends\r\nless and less upon stereotyped physiological reactions which occur in\r\nreflex fashion, in response to environmental stimulation. In higher\r\norganisms, survival depends more upon the capacity of organisms to\r\nmodify their behavior. At the highest levels of functional efficiency,\r\nthe ultimate form of adaptation is seen—the manipulation of the\r\nenvironment by the organism. Developments in behavioral science now\r\npermit us to utilize the adaptive behavior of animals to investigate\r\nmany problems of biological interest. Recent studies on the\r\nself-selection of gravity levels represent a further attempt to exploit\r\nthe adaptive capacities of animals, in order to provide information\r\nrelevant to problems of space exploration.\r\n\r\nOne such project allows animals to select their own gravity environment\r\nin an apparatus designed to create g-forces through centrifugal action\r\nby rotation at 60 rpm ([ref.105]). The surface of this centrifuge is\r\nparabolic, so that the resultant of the centrifugal g and the Earth’s\r\ngravity is always normal to the surface. When the animal moves away from\r\nthe center, increasing the radius of rotation, it is exposed to\r\nincreasing gravity. Motion toward the center reduces the gravity level.\r\nBy this means, an animal is free to select its own gravity environment.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal moves toward or away from the center, he is moving from\r\none tangential velocity to another. He is therefore acted upon by a\r\nthird force—due to Coriolis acceleration. The effects of Coriolis forces\r\nare a major problem difficult to eliminate in studies such as these, but\r\nthey must be taken into account in the design of spacecraft which\r\nproduce artificial gravity by rotation. Motion of the head in any\r\ndirection not parallel to the centrifugal force vector would result in\r\nbizarre stimulation of the semicircular canals and consequent motion\r\nsickness. This effect is likely to become even more pronounced if the\r\nsensitivity of these organs is increased by prolonged exposure to\r\nreduced gravity. Methods such as these are currently being developed for\r\nconducting a refined psychophysical analysis of gravity, including\r\nstudies by Lange and Broderson on the perception of angular, linear, and\r\nCoriolis acceleration.\r\n\r\nThe results of animal studies such as these will be of great value in\r\narriving at a decisive judgment concerning the need for artificial\r\ngravity in a manned orbiting space station, or other vehicles designed\r\nfor long-term occupancy.\r\n\r\nTo aid in the interpretation of in-flight data, other studies are\r\nunderway to determine the functions of the vestibular system, as a\r\nprincipal brain center related to orientation in space and to the\r\nphysiology of posture and movement, as well as with the influences of\r\nacceleration, rotation, and weightlessness. Experiments are presently\r\nbeing conducted on monkeys and cats in order to trace these complex\r\nneurological connections and to determine their functional organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nThe nature of memory has been the subject of considerable speculation in\r\nthe past. It has long been felt intuitively that retention of\r\ninformation in the central nervous system involves either an alteration\r\nof preexisting material or structure, or, alternatively, synthesis of\r\nmaterials not present previously. The cellular site of operational\r\nalteration was unknown but, again intuitively, was felt to be closely\r\nassociated with the synapses. The problems faced by early investigators\r\nwere great; but nevertheless much information relevant to the question\r\nof biological information storage was obtained. With the relatively\r\nrecent advent of more refined tools and methodologies, there has been\r\nrapid progress.\r\n\r\nA significant amount of the work which has been conducted in the area of\r\nbiological information and communication systems is easily classified as\r\n\"basic research\" (refs. [ref.106]-[ref.109]). This discussion will be\r\nlimited to those aspects closely related to the fields of molecular\r\nbiology and experimental psychology, which seem to have universal\r\napplication to all known animal life forms. Studies involving the basic\r\nprinciples of acquisition, processing, storage, and retrieval of\r\ninformation in living systems are emphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Work\r\n\r\nEarly speculations on the operational nature of memory have been based\r\nupon relatively little experimental evidence. Charles Darwin observed\r\nthat domestic rabbits had smaller brains than their wild counterparts,\r\nand attributed this to lack of exercise of their intellect, senses, and\r\nvoluntary movements. Unfortunately, subsequent studies of the brains of\r\nmen with greatly differing intellectual capability did not substantiate\r\nthe hypothesis. Idiots sometimes had larger brains than geniuses. Later,\r\nan idea proposed by Ramon y Cajal came into favor. Since brain cells did\r\nnot increase in number after birth, he proposed that memory involved the\r\nestablishment of new and more extended intercortical connections.\r\nUnfortunately, methods were not available to test this hypothesis\r\nadequately and it has remained until quite recently in the realm of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nAnother major hypothesis was that there were two or more stages in the\r\ninformation storage process. The final form the information took in the\r\nbrain was called a brain engram, or memory trace. However, prior to the\r\nformation of the engram, a transitory process denoted as\r\n\"reverberational memory\" was postulated to exist for a relatively short\r\ntime (minutes to hours) (refs. [ref.106] and [ref.107]). This hypothesis\r\nwas used by Pauling to explain why an elderly chairman of a board could\r\nbrilliantly summarize a complex 8-hour meeting and yet, after its\r\nconclusion and his return to his office, not even remember having\r\nattended the meeting. Thus, this individual’s reverberational memory\r\nfunctioned well, but advanced years had seriously impaired his brain’s\r\nability to form a permanent engram. Similar, although less dramatic,\r\nobservations in other situations are not uncommon. A wide variety of\r\nexperiments have been conducted to study this aspect of memory and to\r\nrelate it to the process whereby the information is transformed to a\r\nmore stable form (refs. [ref.110]-[ref.112]).\r\n\r\nMore recently, the concept of a specific biochemical activity during the\r\nprocess of long-term storage of information has gained considerable\r\nfavor. Initially, neither the site nor the nature of the change was well\r\ndefined. Quite recent studies by Krech et al. (refs. [ref.113] and\r\n[ref.114]), Bennett et al. ([ref.115]), Rosenzweig et al. (refs.\r\n[ref.116] and [ref.117]) support the view that alteration of the levels\r\nof acetylcholinesterase at cortical synapses play an important role in\r\ninformation storage. These studies will be discussed in a later section.\r\nHowever, these authors do not claim that the changes observed are\r\nunambiguously related to the storage of memory. It may well be that the\r\nalterations observed are in some way related to this process but are\r\nstill secondary to some other, more basic, process.\r\n\r\nAn alternative hypothesis is that the information resides in its\r\nultimate form in some more central structure of the neurone than the\r\nsynapse. (It has even been postulated that the basic information is\r\nstored in nonneuronocortical material.) Perhaps Halstead was the first\r\nto postulate the involvement of nucleoprotein in this process\r\n([ref.107]). From the biochemist’s point of view, this is an extremely\r\nattractive hypothesis. Both proteins and nucleic acids possess\r\nsufficient possible permutations of structure to permit storage of a\r\nlifetime’s accumulation of information in an organ the size of the\r\nbrain. From the previously known ability of the nucleic acids to code\r\ngenetic information, they are the prime suspects. However, from the\r\nknown regulatory ability of nucleic acids in specific protein synthesis,\r\nit is possible that the final repository is protein.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Biochemical Studies\r\n\r\nAmong the foremost investigators of the chemistry and biochemistry of\r\nthe central nervous system is Holger Hyden at the University of\r\nGöteborg, Sweden. He and others (refs. [ref.118]-[ref.120]) have for\r\nmany years performed elegant microanalytical studies of single nerve\r\ncells. The evidence which Hyden has obtained is consistent with the\r\nhypothesis that the initial electrical reverberations in the brain\r\ninduce a change in the molecular structure of the ribonucleic acid (RNA)\r\nof the neurones which, in turn, leads to a subsequent deposition of\r\nspecific proteins. It is well known from other investigations that a\r\nmajor role of RNA in any type of cell is to specify and mediate\r\nsynthesis of the protein enzymes of the cells. Thus, in this hypothesis,\r\nit is only necessary to postulate the modification of brain RNA by the\r\nactivities associated with reverberational memory. Particularly\r\npertinent to this hypothesis are observations that—\r\n\r\n  (1) Large nerve cells have a very high rate of metabolism of RNA and\r\n      proteins, and, of the somatic cells, are the largest producers of\r\n      RNA.\r\n  (2) Vestibular stimulation by passive means leads to an increase in\r\n      the RNA content of the Deiters nerve cells of rabbits ([ref.121]).\r\n      The protein content of these cells is also increased.\r\n  (3) Changes in the RNA composition of neurones and glia of the\r\n      brainstem occur during a learning situation. Animals were trained\r\n      over a period of 4 to 5 days to climb a steeply inclined wire to\r\n      obtain food. The big nerve cells and the glia of their lateral\r\n      vestibular apparatus were analyzed, since the Deiters neurones\r\n      present in this structure are directly connected to the middle\r\n      ear. The amount of RNA was found to be increased in the nerve\r\n      cells; and, more significantly, the adenine-to-uracil ratio of\r\n      both the nuclear RNA of nerve cells and glia cells became\r\n      significantly increased ([ref.119]). A variety of control\r\n      experiments were conducted. Although there was an increase in RNA\r\n      content of these cells in animals exposed to passive stimulation,\r\n      there was no change in the ratio of adenine to uracil. Nerve cells\r\n      from the reticular formation, another portion of the brain, had\r\n      only an increased content of RNA with no base-ratio change.\r\n      Animals subjected to a stress experiment involving the vestibular\r\n      nucleus showed only an increase in content of RNA. Littermates\r\n      living in cages on the same diet as learning animals showed no\r\n      change in content of RNA. Thus, it would appear that the change in\r\n      the base ratio of the RNA synthesized is not due to increased\r\n      neurone function per se, but is more directly related to the\r\n      learning process. The fact that this was nuclear RNA implies that\r\n      it was immediately related to chromosomal DNA.\r\n  (4) Neuronal RNA with changed cytosine-guanine ratios synthesized\r\n      during a short period of induced protein synthesis could be\r\n      blocked by actinomycin D. It was concluded, therefore, that the\r\n      RNA was immediately DNA dependent and directly related to the\r\n      genetic apparatus.\r\n\r\nRats which were normally right handed were forced to modify their\r\nhandedness in order to obtain food. The RNA of nerve cells in that part\r\nof the cortex, whose destruction destroys the ability to transfer\r\nhandedness, was analyzed. A significant increase in RNA of nerve cells\r\nof the fifth to sixth cortical layers on the right side of the brain was\r\nobserved. The corresponding nerve cells on the opposite side of the same\r\nbrain served as controls. There was an increase in RNA and a significant\r\nincrease in the purine bases relative to the pyrimidine bases in the\r\nlearning side of the cortex. When the animals were not forced to learn a\r\nnew procedure, only an increase of RNA was observed, with no change in\r\nbase ratio.\r\n\r\nFrank Morrell, head of the Neurology Department at Stanford Medical\r\nSchool, has also been active in this field during the past 6 years. He\r\nhas found that if a primary epileptic lesion is induced on one side of\r\nthe cortex, a secondary mirror lesion eventually develops in the\r\ncontralateral homologous cortex. This secondary lesion, which showed\r\nself-sustaining epileptiform discharge, could be isolated, whereupon the\r\nepileptiform discharge disappeared. This was interpreted as learned\r\nbehavior of the secondary lesion. From changes in the staining\r\nproperties of the secondary lesion, Morrell concluded that changes in\r\nRNA had occurred in the cell. Changes in the composition of the RNA\r\ncould not be shown by these techniques.\r\n\r\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, Drs. Rosenzweig, Bennett,\r\nand Krech have conducted extensive studies related to this topic. These\r\ninvestigators have directed their efforts toward demonstrating\r\nalterations in the cerebral cortex of animals exposed to continuing\r\nlearning situations or continuously deprived of sensory stimulation. In\r\na recent publication ([ref.116]), which also summarizes a considerable\r\namount of previous work, they report studies which demonstrate the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  (1) Rats given enriched experience develop, in comparison with their\r\n      restricted littermates, greater weight and thickness of cortical\r\n      tissue and an associated proportional increase in total\r\n      acetylcholinesterase activity of the cortex.\r\n  (2) The gain in weight of cortical tissue is relatively larger than\r\n      the increase in enzymatic activity. Acetylcholinesterase activity\r\n      increases in other portions of the brain even though tissue weight\r\n      decreases.\r\n  (3) The changes appear in a variety of lines of rats, although\r\n      differing in amount between strains.\r\n  (4) The changes are observed in both the young and adult animals.\r\n\r\nThe previous studies were comparisons between experience-enriched\r\nanimals and animals maintained in isolation. Animals which were housed\r\nin colonies, but given no special treatment, showed intermediate effects\r\nin those situations studied.\r\n\r\nThe Berkeley group emphasized that the finding of changes in the brain\r\nsubsequent to experience does not prove that the changes have anything\r\nto do with memory storage, but do establish the fact that the brain can\r\nrespond to environmental pressure. However, the results are compatible\r\nwith the hypothesis that long-term memory storage involves the formation\r\nof new somatic connections among neurones. Calculations of the amount of\r\nadditional material required to permit this to exist are compatible with\r\nthe increases observed.\r\n\r\nA number of investigators have studied the effects of antimetabolites\r\nand drugs on the learning process. Since their specific metabolic\r\neffects are known in other tissues, the rationale is that if these\r\nmaterials do interfere with memory, then specific types of metabolic\r\nactivities may be implicated in the deposition of the engram.\r\n\r\nOne of the initial studies of this type was conducted by Dingman and\r\nSporn ([ref.122]), presently at the National Institute of Mental Health.\r\nThey showed that 8-azaguanine, a purine antagonist, injected\r\nintra-cisternally was incorporated into the RNA of the brains of rats.\r\nAssociated with this incorporation was an impairment of the\r\nmaze-learning ability of the animals. These findings have been\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nFlexner and his associates injected puromycin, an inhibitor of protein\r\nsynthesis, into the brains of mice, which were then trained to perform\r\nin a maze. Losses of short-term or long-term memory were obtained,\r\ndepending upon the site of the injection. The results indicate that the\r\nhippocampal region is the site of recent memory.\r\n\r\nThe hippocampal region is of interest in connection with memory\r\nprocesses for a number of other reasons. Adey et al. ([ref.123]) and his\r\ngroup observed a transient fall in electrical impedance in this region\r\nwhen cats learned to perform in a T-maze in response to a visual cue. It\r\nwas supposed that the electrodes were situated within glial cells of the\r\ndendritic zone of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer. Extinction of\r\nthe learned habit abolished the briefly evoked impedance changes, which\r\nsubsequently reappeared with retraining.\r\n\r\nA number of other studies more or less indirectly implicate RNA in the\r\nlearning processes. For instance, in retinal cells of rabbits raised in\r\ndarkness, there was virtually no ribonucleoprotein as compared with\r\nnormal amounts in the cells of animals raised in light ([ref.124]).\r\nFurther, maintenance of normal electrical activity of isolated perfused\r\ncat brains is highly dependent upon the presence of the ribonucleic acid\r\nprecursors, uridine and cytidine, in the perfusate ([ref.125]), and\r\nsevere derangements occur if any of a variety of pyrimidine antagonists\r\nare added ([ref.126]). Brief electrical stimulation of cat cortical\r\ntissue causes an increase in nucleic acid cytidine and adenine, thus\r\nindicating a synthesis of altered polynucleotides. Finally, injections\r\nof RNA in animals have shown interesting effects. When given at a dose\r\nof 116 mg/kg daily for 1 month, rats showed an enhanced response and\r\ngreater resistance to extinction in a shock-motivated behavioral\r\nresponse. It has been shown by another group that injections of RNA\r\nenhance the ability of young animals to learn various tasks.\r\n\r\nPlanaria have been used in a variety of studies which seem to bear on\r\nthe problem of memory. Quite recent evidence by Bennett, Calvin, and\r\ntheir associates has cast somewhat of a pall over the studies;\r\nnevertheless, the work may have some validity. Interest in the use of\r\nflatworms, particularly planaria, for study of memory began with a\r\ndemonstration by McConnell that these simple animals could undergo\r\nconditioning ([ref.127]). Subsequently, it was found that some\r\nconditioning was retained when the animal was transected and allowed to\r\nregenerate. The retention of training was found in both new animals,\r\nalthough the very simple brain, really only two ganglia, was in the head\r\nsection ([ref.128]).\r\n\r\nApparently, some diffusely distributed component of the animal was\r\nresponsible for retention of learning. Evidence has accumulated to\r\nindicate that this material is RNA. Among this evidence is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  (1) The two halves of a trained planaria were allowed to regenerate in\r\n      a solution containing RNA-destroying enzymes. Whereas the head\r\n      ends retained some training, no retention was observed in the\r\n      animals derived from the tail end ([ref.129]).\r\n  (2) When pieces of trained planaria were fed to untrained animals, the\r\n      untrained cannibal required a shorter time to become trained to a\r\n      criterion. It would appear that the digestive system of planaria\r\n      is so simple that the material responsible for the transfer of the\r\n      information was not broken down.\r\n  (3) When RNA, obtained from trained planaria, is injected into the\r\n      digestive tract of untrained animals, there is a transfer of\r\n      information.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NEUROPHYSIOLOGY²\r\n\r\n   ² Excerpt from [ref.130].\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurophysiological studies concern the functions of the nervous\r\nsystem—in particular the central nervous system (CNS)—under normal,\r\nsimulated, and actual flight conditions. Of paramount importance is the\r\nmaintenance of equilibrium and orientation in three-dimensional space.\r\nThe ability of man and his close relatives among the vertebrates to\r\nmaintain these functions depends on an integrated sensory input from the\r\nvestibular organ; the eyes; the interoceptors of the muscles, tendons,\r\njoints, and viscera; and the exteroceptors of the skin.\r\n\r\nCertain parameters of the environmental and space-flight conditions\r\ndrastically affect man’s ability to maintain equilibrium and spatial\r\norientation. Centrifugal forces modify or reverse the directional vector\r\nof gravity. Linear acceleration may increase enormously, as may angular\r\nstimulation. The sensory organs listed above are unreliable under such\r\nconditions. The very organ which is designed specifically to furnish\r\ninformation on spatial orientation may malfunction in man while he is in\r\nflight. Thus, with respect to sensory orientation, these labyrinthine\r\norgans are by no means precision instruments.\r\n\r\nThe use of classical histological methods and the observation of\r\nequilibrium disturbances resulting from operative interference with the\r\ninternal ear have in the past been the two principal sources of\r\nknowledge concerning the structure and function of the labyrinth, but\r\nthe answers given to various questions vary considerably in their value.\r\nThe development of electrophysiological techniques and the refinement in\r\nrecent years of the ultrastructural analysis by means of the electron\r\nmicroscope may allow more precise experimental studies of the\r\ncorrelation of function and structure.\r\n\r\nBefore considering vestibular impulses in their bulbar and descending\r\nspinal pathways, a recent study concerning the generation of impulses in\r\nthe labyrinth must be mentioned. Von Bekesy’s finding ([ref.131]) of the\r\ndirect current potentials in the cochlea aroused speculation about the\r\nexistence of similar labyrinthine potentials. Such dc potentials were\r\nalso detected in the semicircular canal of the guinea pig by Trincker\r\n([ref.132]), who measured the potential changes in the endolymph,\r\nsurface of the cupula, or side of the crista during cupular deflection.\r\nIt seems likely, however, that the effects do not represent the\r\nphysicochemical changes in the cupula but the electrical potentials in\r\nthe nerve and nerve endings of the crista. Attempts at differentiating\r\nthese effects have failed so far. Great expectations are brought by the\r\nadvances of microchemistry, microphysiology, and physical chemistry with\r\nregard to the excitatory processes, the generation of the nerve impulse.\r\nQuite apart from a need to understand vestibular nerve discharges and\r\npatterns more adequately in such terms, the analysis of the vestibular\r\nsystem has in the past revealed general biological principles which were\r\nnot readily discernible through the examination of other tissues\r\n([ref.133]).\r\n\r\nThe neural connections of the vestibular organ consist of numerous\r\nchains of neurons, reciprocally linked in many ways and having their\r\nsynapses in various anatomical nuclei. All the chains work in intimate\r\ncollaboration, and the final pattern of reflex responses is attributable\r\nlargely to the highly complex integrating activity of the center. The\r\nlabyrinthine function is automatic, carried out in a reflex fashion: in\r\nother words, mostly below the level of consciousness. The brain centers\r\nthrough which the labyrinth elicits the various appropriate muscular\r\nreactions of the head, body, limbs, and eyes—the righting, the postural,\r\nand the ocular reflexes—represent an intricate mechanism. Before we can\r\nhope for a satisfactory understanding of their functional organization,\r\nwe will have to know their anatomy in more detail. Thus, we are\r\nconfronted with a fruitful field for the exploration of basic mechanisms\r\nof neuronal activity. Major advances dining the last years have provided\r\nus with new information about the neuroanatomy of the vestibular system\r\n(refs. [ref.134]-[ref.137]).\r\n\r\nVestibular impulses entering the brainstem ascend and descend the\r\nneuroaxis and cross the midline. It was previously believed that the\r\nvestibular apparatus had only subcortical projections. Recently,\r\nhowever, it has been established by means of electrophysiological\r\nmethods that the organ is represented by a projection area in the\r\ncerebral cortex of some animals (refs. [ref.138]-[ref.141]). The use of\r\nbrief electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve in order to elicit\r\na cortical response has been of great value for the mapping of these\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nAmong a great variety of sensory receptors, the vestibular ones are\r\ncapable of evoking the most widespread somatovisceral effects throughout\r\nthe body. Moreover, vestibular effects seem to be imperious and less\r\ndependent upon the state of readiness of the nervous system. As a\r\nconsequence of the extensive distribution of vestibular effects, there\r\nare many opportunities for central integration. Proprioceptive and\r\nvestibular systems are both known to be active in posture and\r\nlocomotion; streams of impulses arising from the receptors in each of\r\nthese systems must converge to influence the activity of the final\r\ncommon path. The state of the motor centers of the spinal cord, as\r\naffected by vestibular stimulation, has been tested by dorsal root and\r\nother sensory input interventions. These experiments have provided us\r\nwith insight into the mechanisms concerned with the vestibular control\r\nof spinal reflexes (refs. [ref.142]-[ref.146]).\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the vestibular apparatus is essential for\r\nthe development of motion sickness. Commonplace subjective experience of\r\nnausea relates to visceral changes mediated through autonomic efferent\r\npathways and may ultimately involve rhythmic somatic nerve discharges to\r\nskeletal muscles responsible for retching and vomiting. However, very\r\nlittle is known about the central nervous mechanisms responsible for\r\nelaboration of the whole syndrome. Since the maintenance of vestibular\r\nbombardment for some length of time seems essential for the development\r\nof motion sickness, one would presume this to be an instance of slow\r\ntemporal summation. Experimental findings demonstrate a powerful effect\r\nof temporal summation upon somatic motor outflow during vestibular\r\nstimulation ([ref.147]), and not upon parasympathetic outflow.\r\n\r\nThe practical implication of these studies is closely related to\r\nphysiological effects of weightlessness. Based on experimental evidence\r\nfrom short weightless periods obtained in aircraft, it was concluded\r\nthat \"when the exposure becomes longer, there may develop minor\r\nphysiologic disturbances which, if cumulative or irritating, may cause\r\nor enhance psychiatric symptoms\" ([ref.148]). Although the zero-g\r\ncondition, per se, does not cause spatial disorientation if visual cues\r\nare provided, the astronauts reported a temporary loss of orientation\r\nduring the orbital flight while they were engaged in activities which\r\ndiverted their attention. However, no disturbing sensory inputs were\r\nobserved during the weightless period. Violent head maneuvers within the\r\nlimited mobility of the helmet were performed in every direction without\r\nillusions or vertigo. The subjective sensations of \"tumbling forward\"\r\nafter sustainer engine cutoff reported by the Mercury astronauts, and\r\nTitov’s motion sickness attacks, which were particularly dismaying\r\nduring head movements, were well within the entire range of\r\npsychosomatic experiences already obtained during aerodynamic\r\ntrajectories ([ref.149]). Interestingly enough it now appears that the\r\notolithic output in mammals including man is the differential of linear\r\nacceleration, and therefore unaffected by zero g.\r\n\r\nOf interest in this connection are the problems which may be encountered\r\nduring and following long-term exposure to weightlessness. Although\r\nthere is no evidence of adverse effects on operative behavior, the\r\npossibility of biological disturbances on a cellular or subcellular\r\nlevel, which may cause a deterioration of the somatic basis, has been\r\nrepeatedly stressed. Whether effects of this sort will occur or whether\r\nthe organism will be able to adapt is still an open question. Since\r\nmotion sensitivity based on vestibular stimulation differs widely among\r\nindividuals, the selection of astronauts may solve the problem of zero-g\r\nvestibular disturbance. Reports from the MA-8 (Sigma 7) and Vostok III\r\nand IV flights seem to support this assumption. Moreover, experiments\r\nare being made in the slow rotation room at the Naval School of Aviation\r\nMedicine to study the Coriolis effects which arise when \"artificial\r\ngravity\" is produced by angular acceleration. Since man can adapt to\r\nwave motion on shipboard within a few days, a similar process may be\r\nexpected to occur in the case of long-term weightlessness ([ref.150]).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 5\r\n\r\n_Molecular Biology and Bioinstrumentation_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo support biological investigations in space and to accumulate baseline\r\ndata needed for manned space flight, NASA has conducted a program in\r\nlaboratory research and theory. A multidisciplinary approach has\r\nincluded such fields as ecology, physiology, organic and biological\r\nchemistry, engineering, electronics, and optics. Emphasis in this\r\nprogram has been placed on qualitative and theoretical rather than\r\npurely descriptive research, and the investigation of fundamental\r\nbiological phenomena at all levels, from the molecular to the total life\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\r\n\r\nResearch in molecular biology has included chemical, physical,\r\nbiological, and theoretical investigations of prebiological conditions\r\non Earth and, possibly, on other planets; studies of cellular\r\ninclusions; genetic material (DNA and RNA) and coding; as well as energy\r\ntransfer in biological systems.\r\n\r\nThe understanding of prebiological conditions on Earth, and possible\r\nconditions on other planets, depends upon the nature of the complex\r\nchemical species which might be encountered. Scientists have shown that\r\nbiologically important compounds, such as amino acids, can be generated\r\nby applying an electrical discharge, ultraviolet radiation, or heat to a\r\ngaseous mixture. Biologically interesting compounds can be removed from\r\nsuch a system by condensation or absorption; however, in the limited\r\ntime and space available in such experiments, many compounds are not\r\nproduced in sufficient quantity to be measured.\r\n\r\nThe National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) and the National\r\nBureau of Standards (NBS) are conducting an investigation on equilibria\r\nin multielement systems. The distribution of molecular species at\r\nequilibrium is independent of the way equilibrium was reached and is\r\ndependent only on pressure, temperature, and elemental composition. Many\r\nof the conditions which might have arisen naturally can be approximated\r\nby thermodynamic equilibrium. Compounds which can be formed at\r\nequilibrium need no special mechanism to explain their presence.\r\nHowever, special mechanisms have to be sought for those compounds which\r\ncould not be so produced and which would have been required for the\r\nstructure and nutrition of the first living organisms.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of precise knowledge of the composition of the primitive\r\nplanetary atmospheres, equilibrium concentrations with a wide range of\r\ntemperatures, pressures, and elemental compositions are being\r\ninvestigated by NBRF and NBS. These investigators have postulated that\r\nthe maximum atmospheric pressure may have approached 100 atm if the\r\nprimitive Earth was sufficiently hot and if an appreciable portion of\r\nthe water on Earth’s surface today was present on primitive Earth. (If\r\nthe present oceans were to evaporate, the surface pressure would be\r\napproximately 300 atm.) Low pressures of 10⁻⁶ atm and temperatures\r\nbetween 500° and 1000° K are being used.\r\n\r\nA large range of N, O, C, and H compositions are being investigated for\r\ninteresting and plausible combinations of factors. In these calculations\r\nan IBM 7090 computer is being used to obtain data on a very large number\r\nof combinations of chemicals. Other chemical species will be added as\r\nthe research continues. Some results of this study give an insight into\r\nthe variety of biologically significant chemicals which might have\r\nexisted during Earth’s primitive prebiological condition or may now\r\nexist on the surfaces and in the atmospheres of other planets (refs.\r\n[ref.151]-[ref.153]). The general method described by White et al.\r\n([ref.152]), minimizing the free energy of the system, was used. The\r\nsolution was approached by an iterative process, starting with an\r\ninitial guess of concentrations of the compounds. At each step, _M_+1\r\nlinear equations are solved where _M_ is the number of elements in the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn addition to listing of the concentrations of all compounds included\r\nin each problem, the results of three-element problems have been\r\nexpressed on a triangular composition diagram for convenience. A coarse\r\ngrid of 60 points is used to survey all elemental compositions, with\r\nfiner grids being used in regions of particular interest. The calculated\r\nconcentrations of the compounds at each composition are stored, and\r\nfinally a series of triangular diagrams is printed out, each showing the\r\nconcentrations of as many as four compounds at the grid points.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows the results obtained in the C, H, and O systems. Organic\r\ncompounds in concentrations greater than 10⁻²⁰ mole fraction are found\r\neverywhere except where free O₂, is present. Solid carbon theoretically\r\nbecomes stable along the lower dashed line at 500° K. However, reactions\r\nproducing it are very slow. The supersaturated region beyond the line of\r\npotential carbon formation was also investigated. A threshold was found\r\nwhere polynuclear aromatic compounds are sufficiently concentrated to\r\nform a liquid phase. These conditions may have been involved in the\r\nprimordial formation of asphaltic petroleum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.—_Equilibrium diagram for the system C-H-O._]\r\n\r\nJukes and associates ([ref.154]) at the University of California at\r\nBerkeley have been investigating the code for amino acids in protein\r\nsynthesis, the key for translating the sequence of bases in DNA into the\r\nsequence of amino acids in proteins. The amino acid code was solely a\r\nmatter of theory until Nirenberg and Matthaei ([ref.155]) at the\r\nNational Institutes of Health carried out a crucial experiment. This\r\nexperiment bridged the last remaining gap separating theoretical\r\ngenetics and test-tube biochemistry. It now became experimentally\r\npossible to search for codes for all 20 amino acids concerned in the\r\nsynthesis of proteins.\r\n\r\nThe amino acid bases of DNA are: A, adenine; C, cytosine; G, guanine; T,\r\nthymine; and U, uracil, which replaces thymine in RNA. There are only 16\r\nways of arranging A, C, G, and T in pairs. For this and other reasons it\r\nis thought that a triplet of three consecutive bases is needed to code\r\nfor each amino acid. The sequences of bases in a strand of DNA are known\r\nto be unrestricted with respect to the order in which they occur;\r\napparently any one of the four bases can be next to any of the other\r\nfour, although, of course, each base must be paired with the\r\ncorresponding complementary base in the adjacent strand. Since the same\r\nfreedom is true of the amino acid sequences in the polypeptide chains of\r\nproteins, any one of the 20 amino acids can occur next to any other.\r\nMoreover, the sequences in DNA are subject to mutational changes in\r\nwhich one base replaces another, or bases are added to or deleted from\r\nthe DNA. Such rearrangements plus the possibility of lengthening of DNA\r\nmolecules are numerous enough to account for all the genetics of living\r\nforms since the first appearance of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge is based on experiments with synthetic RNA carried\r\nout with extracts of _E. coli_. The majority of the work has been at\r\nNirenberg’s laboratory at the National Institutes of Health and at\r\nOchoa’s laboratory at New York University ([ref.155]). Various\r\ncombinations of A, C, G, and U were used in preparing the synthetic RNA\r\nmolecules that are used in experiments to explore the code. These\r\nmolecules are made by incubating a mixture of ribonucleoside\r\ndiphosphates with a specific enzyme, polynucleotide phosphorylase. An\r\nimportant property of this enzyme is that it condenses the nucleoside\r\ndiphosphates into polynucleotide strands containing random sequences\r\ndepending on the proportion of each base. For example, if the enzyme\r\nwere furnished with a mixture of 5 parts of A and 1 part of C, it would\r\nmake strands containing, on the average, 25 sequences of AAA, 5 of AAC,\r\n5 of ACA, 5 of CAA, and 1 each of ACC, CAC, and CCA. The proportion of\r\ntriplets within the strands of a polynucleotide is reflected in the\r\nproportion of amino acids in polypeptides that are obtained in the\r\ncell-free system. Most of the present knowledge of the amino acid code\r\nis based on this concept. All the proposed codes have been discovered by\r\nthis experimental approach where synthetic RNA molecules are used as\r\n\"artificial\" messenger RNA.\r\n\r\nRepresentative of another class of activities in molecular biology is\r\nthe examination of passive ion flux across axon membranes. This work is\r\nbeing done by Goldman at the National Naval Medical Center. The question\r\nof stimulus transmission by nerve tissue is far from simple, and the ion\r\nconcentrations associated with nerve membranes is a significant part of\r\nthe answer. Because the space environment may very well produce\r\nalterations in these ion potentials, an investigation of their natures\r\nand significance becomes extremely important. A working theory is now\r\nbeing developed as a result of this study.\r\n\r\nVital cell processes, chemical transformations, and mechanisms that\r\nprovide energy for cell maintenance and activity have been studied by\r\nKiesow (refs. [ref.157] and [ref.158]) at the Naval Medical Research\r\nInstitute. The common objective of all phases of this project is the\r\nelucidation of reaction steps in which energy and matter are transformed\r\nin living systems. Compared with _photo_synthetic organisms,\r\n_chemo_synthetic bacteria offer distinct advantages for the study of\r\nenergy assimilation. These studies have led to the following\r\nexperimental findings.\r\n\r\nWith the energy from oxidation of nitrite, NO₂— to nitrate, NO₃— as an\r\n_inorganic_ source, and with added _organic_ chemical energy from the\r\nhydrolysis of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) to adenosinediphosphate (ADP)\r\nand inorganic phosphate, chemosynthetic bacteria are capable of reducing\r\ndiphosphopyridinenucleotide (DPN⁺) to DPNH, in a coupled\r\noxidoreduction-dephosphorylation. Thus, in the crucial step of\r\nchemosynthesis, _ATP is consumed, not produced_. However, in\r\nsimultaneously proceeding cell respiration, the energy donor, DPNH, is\r\noxidized and generates more ATP than is required for DPN⁺ reduction.\r\nThis \"breeder cycle\" for DPNH—with different ratios of cell respiration\r\nand biosynthesis—results in a net production of either DPNH, or ATP, or\r\nboth. Production of DPNH in the cycle leads immediately to the\r\nassimilation of C¹⁴ from HC¹⁴O₃—. These observations explain the\r\nbacteria’s energy source without the classical hypotheses of either\r\ndirect phosphorylation or direct CO₂ reduction by inorganic chemical or\r\nelectromagnetic energy. The cycle transforms the free energy of nitrite\r\noxidation into the free energy of the organic compounds. Cell\r\nrespiration and elementary biosynthesis proceed through structure-bound\r\nenzyme systems in the same fraction of subcellular particles. Three\r\ncomponents, two cytochromes and one flavoprotein, have been identified.\r\nA thermodynamic analysis of the DPNH \"breeder cycle\" appears to be\r\nattainable by measurements of redox potentials and calorimetric\r\ndeterminations of heats of reaction.\r\n\r\nStudies are also being conducted by Pollard and associates at\r\nPennsylvania State University in an attempt to formulate a theoretical\r\nbasis for the description of the processes of synthesis, growth,\r\ndivision, and differentiation of the living cell. Such a theory would be\r\nbasic to an understanding of very primitive life forms or prebiological\r\nmaterial which might be found elsewhere in the universe. For these\r\npurposes, studies are being undertaken in macromolecular reproduction\r\nwhich differ from the studies involving cellular genetic material.\r\nTheories concerning the problem of replication of cellular structures\r\nand information storage in two-dimensional systems are being developed.\r\nTheories are also being developed about the mechanisms which control and\r\nregulate receptor and enzymatic activities within the cell.\r\n\r\nOne study involved the rate of mutation in cells and disposed of the\r\nsuggestion that the process of mutation consists of a \"tunneling\" of\r\nproton from one base to another in DNA. Such a suggestion can no longer\r\nbe advanced as a major explanation of mutations.\r\n\r\nWork is also being conducted on the centrifugation of cells of _E.\r\ncoli_. It has been shown that cells exposed to as little as 100 g have a\r\nmodification in their function. This has been looked at from the point\r\nof view of thymine uptake, which would be concerned with the formation\r\nof DNA, and also from the point of view of the induction of an enzyme,\r\nwhich would correspond to the transcription of the DNA. Preliminary\r\nexperiments in the latter case indicate considerable centrifugation\r\neffect. The thymine uptake is affected, but not nearly as much as\r\nformerly thought. Further work is in progress in this area.\r\n\r\nImportant work has been completed on the cells of _E. coli_ grown on\r\nmaltose, which can be induced to produce betagalactosidase by the\r\naddition of thiomethyl galactoside. If cells are irradiated shortly\r\nafter induction, the transcription of the DNA ceases and the enzyme\r\nproduced by the messenger RNA is observed to reach a maximum. This\r\nenables the calculation of the half-life of unstable messenger RNA. The\r\nhalf-life for this decay is readily measurable, and values are given\r\nover a temperature range of 17° C (5.2 minimum) to 45° C (0.56 minimum).\r\nThese agree very well with half-lives measured by others by inducing for\r\nshort times and measuring the course of enzyme formation. The rate of\r\ntranscription is involved in the kinetics of cessation of enzyme\r\ninduction, and the rate of transcription can be measured. Arrhenius\r\nplots for this rate and the rate of decay are given, and the activation\r\nenergies measured are about 16 000 cal/mole. The cessation of\r\ntranscription is linked to the degradation, possibly of only one strand,\r\nof DNA.\r\n\r\nPollard has suggested that one important action of ionizing radiation is\r\nconcerned with the transcription of the genetic message into RNA.\r\nClayton and Adler ([ref.159]) showed that induced catalase synthesis in\r\n_Rhodopseudomonas spheroides_ is inhibited by low doses of X-rays,\r\ngiving experimental support to the idea. Pollard and Vogler ([ref.160]),\r\nusing cells in which the process of induction involved permease, showed\r\nthat there is some sensitivity to gamma radiation. Novelli et al.\r\n([ref.161]) found a reduced sensitivity as compared with colony\r\nformation, but it is still a considerable sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThe process of induction of an enzyme indicates that the transcription\r\nof the genetic message is repressed by something which can be acted on\r\nby a small molecule, the inducer, to remove repression and permit the\r\nformation of messenger RNA, which then acts to make the enzyme. The\r\nmessenger RNA undergoes decay through a process which is still not\r\nclear. Very elegant measurements by Kepes ([ref.162]) show that for the\r\nmessenger RNA for betagalactosidase, the half-life is 1.02 min at 37° C\r\nand 2.05 min at 25° C. The time of onset of enzyme formation after\r\ninduction was found to be about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf the process of transcription is indeed sensitive to ionizing\r\nradiation, then the irradiation of cells which have just been induced\r\nshould show formation of the enzyme to the extent of formation of new\r\nmessenger RNA within a few minutes, plus the formation of the enzyme\r\nwhile the messenger RNA is decaying. This pattern was found by Clayton\r\nand Adler. The experiments conducted by Pollard and associates amplify\r\nand extend their work and also agree with the work of Kepes ([ref.162]).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BIOINSTRUMENTATION\r\n\r\nFernandez-Moran (refs. [ref.163]-[ref.165]), at the University of\r\nChicago, has devised a new multielectrode electrostatic lens which he\r\nhas incorporated into an electron microscope. This necessitated the\r\ndevelopment of a novel high-voltage power source and voltage regulator\r\nof extreme stability and accuracy. Some promising work has now been done\r\non superconducting lenses. In a series of experiments with a simple\r\nelectron microscope without pole pieces, using high-field\r\nsuperconducting niobium-zirconium solenoid lenses in an open air core,\r\nliquid helium Dewar, electron microscopic images of test specimens have\r\nbeen recorded while operating at 32 200 gauss in a persistent current\r\nmode, with regulated accelerating potentials of 4 to 8 kilovolts. These\r\npreliminary experiments have demonstrated the exceptional stability of\r\nthe images (both short term and long term) over a period of 4 to 8 hours\r\nand the relatively high quality of the images.\r\n\r\nProgress has been made on the viscosimeter for high intrinsic\r\nviscosities. This is now working, and the viscosity of DNA preparations\r\nhas been measured. It is hoped to use the viscosimeter to study the\r\nvariation in DNA viscosity as a function of the cell cycle.\r\n\r\nAn instrument is under development by Wald at the University of\r\nPittsburgh to automatically analyze cytogenetic material and, thus,\r\nextend cytogenetic methodology both for research and as a biological\r\nmonitoring procedure, using automatic electronic scanning and computer\r\nanalysis of chromosomes. Chromosomal aberrations can thus be monitored\r\nunder unusual and abnormal conditions such as weightlessness and\r\nradiation, since chromosomes are very sensitive to stress situations. In\r\nthis device a sample will be prepared and automatically inserted under a\r\nmicroscope lens. The device will then scan, identify, and photograph on\r\n35-mm film a predetermined number of mitotic cells and process the film.\r\nThe data will be recorded under the direct control of a digital\r\ncomputer. The computer will perform a detailed quantitative analysis of\r\nthe pictorial data.\r\n\r\nSignificant effort has been expended in the development of\r\ninstrumentation for measuring and recording electrophysiological\r\ninformation. One such instrument, developed by the Franklin Institute,\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., is a temperature-sensing microprobe. This microprobe\r\nis an implantable and remote broadcasting instrument. These developments\r\nare associated, in part, with training programs so that competent\r\nindividuals may be trained not only in electronics but also in the\r\nbiological uses of the devices they construct.\r\n\r\nA project of interest, conducted at the Stanford Research Institute, is\r\nthe investigation of the uses of an extremely sensitive method for\r\nmeasuring magnetic susceptibility having the possibility of detecting\r\nmacroscopic quantum effects in macromolecules of biological interest.\r\nGood progress has been made in the first 15 months of a project devoted\r\nto the development and initial use of equipment specifically designed\r\nfor this purpose. A new superconducting circuit, together with\r\nsuperconducting magnetic shields, has been constructed. This apparatus\r\ncan measure the magnetic susceptibility of small organic samples at\r\ntemperatures between 1° and 300° K in fields up to 40 000 gauss. It can\r\ndetect flux changes of 10⁷ gauss-cm², which is equivalent to detecting a\r\nchange in specific susceptibility of 1 in 10⁹ in a 100-mg sample under\r\nan applied field of 10 000 gauss.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred preliminary measurements were made on samples of\r\ncoronene. The most reliable of these were in agreement with published\r\nvalues of the magnetic susceptibility of coronene. Experience during\r\nthese measurements led to changes which have resulted in an apparatus\r\nwell suited to the measurements on macromolecules. An improved version\r\nof the superconducting circuit now available shows promise of a further\r\nimprovement in sensitivity by a factor of more than a thousand\r\n([ref.166]).\r\n\r\nLiving organisms possess many unique processes and systems which are\r\ncomplex and poorly understood. The new theoretical approaches, combined\r\nwith laboratory studies, are expected to result in advances which will\r\nexpand both our scientific and technological horizons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 6\r\n\r\n_Flight Programs_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BALLOONS\r\n\r\nBiological and medical experiments carried out on balloon flights, both\r\nmanned and unmanned, antedate the establishment of NASA. Aside from the\r\nearly use of balloons in flights that could be called simply\r\nflight-survival studies, balloons have made important contributions to\r\nour present knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation and to various\r\naspects of space travel.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the Strato-Lab and Man High series by the U.S. Navy\r\nand Air Force include a wealth of information on balloon travel and on\r\nthe survival of man at altitudes close to and above 100 000 feet.\r\nGenerally, balloon launches of animals, which reached a maximum in 1953\r\nwhen 23 balloons were released, have established the feasibility of a\r\nprogram of extended manned balloon flights to high altitudes.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric life studies outside the area of cosmic radiation effects\r\nhave been comparatively few. Results from two manned flights, Strato-Lab\r\nI and II, indicate that the flights did produce pronounced changes in\r\nwhite blood cell count; however, the data suggest that these changes\r\nwere due to psychological rather than physical stress. Exposure to\r\naltitudes above 90 000 feet for a total of 62 hours did not produce any\r\ngeneral behavioral change in two Java monkeys, according to other\r\nballoon flights. Many of these flights were effective in testing\r\nequipment, telemetering devices, and in pointing the way for other\r\nflights.\r\n\r\nStratoscope I and II, originally undertaken by the Office of Naval\r\nResearch (ONR), are projects involving various astronomical observations\r\nwith the aid of a balloon-borne telescope and television and camera\r\nsystems. NASA cooperated with ONR on Stratoscope II (36-inch telescope\r\ncompared with Stratoscope I’s 12-inch telescope) which has already\r\nresulted in significant discoveries about the nature of the planets and\r\nstars. Water vapor has been identified in the atmosphere of cool red\r\nstars and an analysis of the Martian spectra showed a greater abundance\r\nof carbon dioxide than had previously been believed. Since the\r\nballoon-borne telescope was carried beyond Earth’s obscuring atmosphere,\r\nthe Stratoscope projects have yielded valuable photographs of the Sun,\r\nstars, and various planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ROCKETS AND SATELLITES\r\n\r\nHistorically, biological experiments aboard rockets and satellites have\r\nbeen limited to a \"piggyback\" and \"noninterference\" basis on military\r\nrockets. For the past few years, however, as the effort toward manned\r\nspace flight leading to lunar and Martian landings increased, more\r\nattention was devoted to experiments designed to show the effects of the\r\nspace environment on living systems. As in the balloon flight programs,\r\nthe U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force played an important role, reaching\r\nwhat might be considered a high point with the successful launch and\r\nrecovery of a ballistic rocket experiment with monkeys Able and Baker.\r\nAerobee rockets as well as Thor IRBM’s carried biological payloads\r\nconsisting of mice and monkeys on six launches, contributing to our\r\nknowledge of the effects of weightlessness and radiation on higher\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nVan der Wal and Young ([ref.78]) used Thor-Able combinations to serve as\r\nboosters for lifting a 20-pound biocapsule to a peak altitude of 1400\r\nmiles and over a distance of about 5300 miles from Cape Canaveral to the\r\nwest coast of Africa. Weightlessness was attained for a period of almost\r\n40 minutes. During reentry into the atmosphere, a peak deceleration of\r\nabout 60 g was reached. Each of the three capsules flown carried one\r\nmouse (Mouse-in-Able); two of the mice were instrumented for heart-rate\r\ntelemetry. Although all three mice were lost, the two experiments with\r\nLaska and Benji yielded physiological results.\r\n\r\nThe experimenters designed effective instrumentation for registering the\r\nelectrical activity of the mouse’s heart through a single commutated\r\ntelemetry channel. Records were obtained for both animals during various\r\nportions of the flight. The results indicate that both animals were\r\nalive when the nose cones hit the water.\r\n\r\nTwo South American squirrel monkeys (Gordo and Baker) and a rhesus\r\nmonkey (Able) were launched into space from Cape Canaveral in 1958 and\r\n1959 by U.S. Army Jupiter missiles. The vehicles reached speeds of\r\napproximately 10 000 mph and altitudes of 300 miles on flights which\r\nlasted about 15 min.\r\n\r\nTime courses of cardiac and respiratory rates ([ref.80]) of the two\r\nsquirrel monkeys showed that the noise of the engine at liftoff\r\nimmediately produced an increase in their heart rates. Respiration also\r\nincreased temporarily, but slowed later with increasing acceleration.\r\nHeart rates fluctuated considerably during launch acceleration, which\r\nreached about 15 g at cutoff.\r\n\r\nThe period of free flight and weightlessness was characterized by\r\npronounced fluctuations of heart activity in the postacceleration phase.\r\nThereafter, the heart rate of Baker remained relatively constant,\r\nwhereas the cardiac activity of Gordo fluctuated markedly and decreased\r\nslowly almost to the end of his flight. Slight changes, which were\r\ntransient and not pathological in nature, were also noted in the\r\nelectrocardiogram. Gordo’s respiration was very shallow during maximum\r\nlaunch acceleration, when Baker’s reached its highest value, only to be\r\napproximated again during reentry when forces of about 35 g were\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nAble’s cardiac and respiratory rates indicated that, after an initial\r\nstartle reaction, the heart rate dropped transiently and then increased\r\nsteeply, reaching a maximum of 259 during the 10-second interval at peak\r\nacceleration. Respiration increased only slightly throughout the\r\nlaunching phase. There was a period of tachycardia during\r\npostacceleration weightlessness, after which the heart rate declined\r\nsteadily and was disturbed only by several startling missile events. At\r\nthe end of the subgravity phase, Able’s cardiac rate was slightly below\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the periods of high g force and free flight were short, the\r\nextremes were considerable, and the changes from one state to the next\r\nwere rapid. In spite of this, the cardiovascular, hemodynamic, and\r\nelectrocardiographic phenomena were remarkably well maintained.\r\nApparently the animals were not in serious plight at any time. That\r\npsychological factors entered into the observed phenomena is clearly\r\nevident from the increase in cardiac rate associated with the noise of\r\nthe engine prior to liftoff and also from the cinematographic record of\r\nfacial expressions. Nevertheless, the integrated responses indicated\r\nthat the animals’ physiological states remained sufficiently normal to\r\ninsure a safe flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LITTLE JOE FLIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe first step in an attempt at animal verification of the adequacy of\r\nthe Mercury flight program was the development of two tests by NASA in\r\ncollaboration with the U.S. Air Force School of Aviation Medicine in\r\nwhich there would be a biomedical evaluation of the accelerations\r\nexperienced during the abort of a Mercury flight at and shortly after\r\nliftoff. These flights were launched at the NASA Wallops Station with a\r\nLittle Joe solid-fuel launch vehicle.\r\n\r\nTwo Little Joe launches were made with activation of the escape rockets\r\nduring the boost phase to secure maximum acceleration; only a brief\r\nperiod of weightlessness was attained. The first launch was on December\r\n4, 1959, and the other on January 21, 1960. A 36 by 18-inch sealed,\r\n125-pound, cylindrical capsule containing the subject, an 8-pound\r\n_Macaca mulatta_, the necessary life-support system, and associated\r\ninstrumentation was flown in a \"boilerplate\" model of the Mercury\r\nspacecraft. The rhesus monkeys were named \"Sam\" and \"Miss Sam.\"\r\n\r\nThe flight profile included maximum accelerations of about 10 to 12 g\r\nand periods of about 3 minutes at 0±0.02 g. The peak altitude obtained\r\nin the last ballistic flight was about 280 000 feet. The experimental\r\ncapsule was pressurized at 1 atmosphere with 100 percent oxygen at the\r\nstart of the experiment and fell to just below a half atmosphere of\r\noxygen due to breathing during flight. The capsule temperature was kept\r\nbetween 10° and 20° C in both flights.\r\n\r\nThe measurements taken from the rhesus monkeys were the\r\nelectrocardiogram, respiration, body temperature, eye movements, and bar\r\npressing, but only partial results were obtained in the first flight.\r\nOxygen tension, total pressure, capsule temperature, and relative\r\nhumidity were recorded. Both animals were recovered alive and did not\r\nshow pathologic alterations in their physiologic and psychological\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MERCURY ANIMAL TEST FLIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn the Mercury animal test program a Redstone missile carried the\r\nchimpanzee Ham on a ballistic flight to a height of 155 miles to provide\r\nanimal verification of the success with which the Mercury system could\r\nbe applied to manned flight. The male chimpanzee was trained to perform\r\na two-phased reaction task during the 16 minutes of flight. The\r\nchimpanzee Enos was put into orbit for 3 hours and 20 minutes. Results\r\nof the two flights gave the following information:\r\n\r\n  (1) Pulse and respiration rates during both the ballistic (MR-2) and\r\n      the orbital (MA-5) flights remained within normal limits\r\n      throughout the weightless state. Effectiveness of heart action, as\r\n      evaluated from the electrocardiograms and pressure records, was\r\n      also unaffected by the flights.\r\n  (2) Blood pressures, both arterial and venous, were not significantly\r\n      changed from preflight values during 3 hours of the weightless\r\n      state.\r\n  (3) The performance of a series of tasks involving continuous and\r\n      discrete avoidance, fixed ratio responses for food reward, delayed\r\n      response for a fluid reward, and solution of a simple oddity\r\n      problem was unaffected by the weightless state.\r\n  (4) Animals trained in the laboratory to perform during simulated\r\n      acceleration, noise, and vibration of launch and reentry were able\r\n      to maintain performance throughout an actual flight.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of the MR-2 and MA-5 flights, the following conclusions\r\nwere drawn:\r\n\r\n  (1) The numerous objectives of the Mercury animal test program were\r\n      met. The MR-2 and MA-5 tests preceded the first ballistic and\r\n      orbital manned flights, respectively, and provided valuable\r\n      training in countdown procedures and range monitoring and recovery\r\n      techniques. The bioinstrumentation was effectively tested and the\r\n      adequacy of the environmental control system was demonstrated.\r\n  (2) A 7-minute (MR-2) and a 3-hour (MA-5) exposure to the weightless\r\n      state were experienced by the subjects in an experimental design\r\n      which left visual and tactile references unimpaired. There was no\r\n      significant change in the physiological state or performance of\r\n      the animals as measured during a series of tasks of graded\r\n      motivation and difficulty.\r\n  (3) Questions were answered concerning the physical and mental demands\r\n      that the astronauts would encounter during space flight, and it\r\n      was shown that these demands would not be excessive.\r\n  (4) It was also demonstrated that the young chimpanzee can be trained\r\n      to be a highly reliable subject for space-flight studies.\r\n\r\nThe suborbital ballistic flight of Ham on January 31, 1961, was the\r\nprelude to Alan R. Shepard’s suborbital space flight, while the orbital\r\nflight of Enos on November 29, 1961, preceded the orbital flight of John\r\nH. Glenn.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we now categorize these events as belonging to the rather\r\ndistant past, although they occurred only about 4 years ago, serves to\r\nemphasize the pace of development in the exploration of space. While the\r\nchimpanzee program may pale in the light of subsequent successes, its\r\nscientific and technological contribution should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this project can be fully appreciated, and its\r\ncontribution judged, only by considering the lack of knowledge existing\r\nat the time of its conception. In addition to its essential training\r\nfunction, this project verified the feasibility of manned space flight\r\nthrough operational tests of the Mercury life-support system. It\r\ndemonstrated that complex behavioral processes and basic physiological\r\nfunctions remained essentially unperturbed during brief exposures to\r\nspace flight. The Mercury chimpanzee program marked the first time that\r\nphysiological and behavioral assessment techniques were combined for\r\nevaluating the functional efficiency of the total organism in space.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ultimate contribution of this program was in providing the\r\nframework of knowledge upon which future scientific experiments on\r\nbiological organisms, exposed to flights of extended durations, must be\r\nbased. Biosatellite experiments designed to seek more subtle and elusive\r\neffects of prolonged space flight on biological functioning will require\r\neven more refined and difficult techniques, but will depend heavily on\r\nthe groundwork laid in these early steps of Project Mercury.\r\n\r\nA summary of the more important animal suborbital and orbital flights\r\nduring the period 1957 to 1964 is presented in table VII.\r\n\r\nIn another NASA-supported flight, _NERV_ 1, various experiments were\r\ncarried in a suborbital flight of 20 minutes. _Neurospora_ molds showed\r\na surprisingly high level of mutation, but the control molds also had\r\nhigh rates.\r\n\r\nThe Discoverer XVII and XVIII flights, to which the Air Force\r\ncontributed, resulted in many interesting findings relative to the\r\nresponses of living systems to space flight. On the Discoverer XVII\r\nflight, samples of human gamma globulin and rabbit antiserum specific\r\nfor human gamma globulin showed an increase in reactivity, and samples\r\nof synovial and conjunctival cells showed no changes in their\r\ncytological characteristics.\r\n\r\nDiscoverer XVIII was launched during a massive solar flare which lasted\r\nfor the first 13 hours of the 48-orbit, 3-day flight. _Neurospora\r\nconidia_, nerve tissue, algae, human bone marrow, eyelid tissue, gamma\r\nglobulin, and cancer cells were put in orbit. The results indicated that\r\nbiological specimens may be able to withstand radiation from solar\r\nflares with a minimum of shielding and that aluminum shielding may be\r\nbetter than lead.\r\n\r\nIn 1949, the U.S.S.R. began a systematic, uninterrupted research program\r\nin biological space experimentation. They have studied the effects of\r\nphysical stress, immune reactions, psychobiology and behavior, genetics,\r\nand responses to environmental factors such as spacecraft dynamics and\r\nambient radiation. The organisms and biological materials included\r\ntobacco mosaic and influenza viruses; T2 and T4 bacteriophage; _Bacillus\r\naerogenes_; lysogenic bacteria; _Clostridium butyricum_; _Escherichia\r\ncoli_; actinomycetes; yeasts; _Chlorella pyrenoidosa_; seeds of fir,\r\npine, onion, corn, lettuce, wheat, cabbage, carrot, buckwheat, cucumber,\r\nbeet, _Euonymus_, fennel, mustard, pea, broad bean, tomato, and nutmeg;\r\n_Tradescantia paludosa_; _Ascaris_ eggs; snail spawn; _Drosophila\r\nmelanogaster_; loach roe; frog eggs and sperm; guinea pigs; mice; rats;\r\nhamsters; rabbits; dogs; monkeys; human and rabbit skin; HeLa tissue\r\ncultures and other tissues (refs.

Unique components of the space environment of biological\r\nimportance are weightlessness or greatly decreased gravity, the\r\nimposition of an environment disconnected from Earth’s 24-hour rotation\r\n(particularly its effect on biorhythms), and cosmic radiation with\r\nenergies and particle sizes unmatched by anything produced artificially\r\non Earth ([ref.169]).\r\n\r\nAs progress is made in the manned exploration of space, the biological\r\neffects of its unique environmental factors become of greater\r\nimportance. It is essential to determine the effects of space\r\nenvironment on man’s ability to perform physical and mental tasks. In\r\naddition, it is necessary to develop those systems required for his\r\nsurvival and for his physiological and psychological well-being, both in\r\nspace and in his subsequent resumption of normal life patterns. Despite\r\nnearly a century of research and development in environmental\r\nphysiology, a number of phenomena will be encountered in long-term space\r\nflight with which we have had neither the experience that would enable\r\nus to predict the effects nor to develop the necessary protective or\r\nremedial measures ([ref.170]). Many of the experimental programs in\r\nbioscience are being carried out or planned so that the deleterious\r\neffects of these phenomena may be determined, predicted, or avoided\r\nbefore they are encountered in manned flight.\r\n\r\nBiological experimentation has been carried out in orbiting spacecraft\r\nby Soviet and American scientists preparatory to manned space flight.\r\nThese first-generation exploratory experiments had the following\r\nobjectives:\r\n\r\n  (1) To discover whether complex organisms could survive space\r\n      conditions and to test life-support systems\r\n  (2) To determine whether complex organisms (dogs and primates) could\r\n      survive launch, orbital space flight, reentry, and recovery\r\n  (3) To determine the effects of space radiation and any obvious\r\n      effects of weightlessness on biological organisms\r\n\r\nThese biological studies indicate that manned space flight was\r\npracticable, and the various cosmonaut and astronaut flights have proven\r\nthe validity of the results.\r\n\r\nThe National Academy of Sciences’ Space Science Board summer study\r\n([ref.171]) recommended that—\r\n\r\n    NASA should exploit special features of the space environment as\r\n    unique situations for the general analysis of the\r\n    organism-environment relationships including, especially, the\r\n    role environmental inputs play in the establishment and\r\n    maintenance of normal organization in the living system. NASA\r\n    should support studies in ground-based and in orbiting\r\n    laboratories [biosatellites] on the biological effects of\r\n    gravity fields both above and below normal. This should be\r\n    considered a major responsibility of NASA in the area of\r\n    environmental opportunities. NASA should support studies of\r\n    biological rhythms in plants and animals including man as part\r\n    of its effort in environmental biology. Investigate by\r\n    observation of rhythms in organisms in space in (_a_) polar and\r\n    equatorial low orbits; (_b_) orbits less than, equal to and\r\n    greater than 22,000 miles. Properly designed experiments should\r\n    be conducted to explore the effects of different environmental\r\n    factors when these impinge simultaneously on test organisms.\r\n\r\nThe Panel on Gravity of the Space Science Board ([ref.67]) stated that\r\nthe major effects of low gravity would be expected in heterocellular\r\norganisms that develop in more or less fixed orientation with respect to\r\nterrestrial gravity and which respond to changes in orientation with\r\nrelatively long induction periods, including the higher plants. On the\r\nother extreme are the complex primates which respond rapidly, but whose\r\nmultiplicity of organs and correlative mechanisms make the occurrence of\r\nmalfunction and disorganization probable, but not certain. The Panel\r\nrecommended emphasis on early embryogenesis and histogenesis,\r\nparticularly of plants during exposure to low gravity, and anatomical\r\nstudies after low gravity. They stated that perturbations of the\r\nenvironment to which the experimental organism is exposed must be\r\nlimited or controlled to reduce uncertainties in interpretation of\r\nresults. At the same time, the introduction of known perturbations may\r\nassist in isolating the effects due solely to gravity. Ground-based\r\nclinostats and centrifuges should be used in conjunction with the\r\nexperiments, and an attempt should be made to extrapolate effects of low\r\ngravity with the clinostat.\r\n\r\nThe study of the effects of unique or unknown space environmental\r\nfactors will probably yield unexpected results which may drastically\r\nmodify future technical approaches. The results from these biosatellite\r\nstudies will have broad application to longer term, manned space flight,\r\nincluding manned space stations and lunar and planetary exploration.\r\n\r\nThe biosatellite program is a second-generation series of carefully\r\nplanned and selected experiments, including some highly sophisticated\r\nexperiments which have required several years of baseline study and\r\nequipment development. These orbiting recoverable biosatellites will\r\nprovide opportunities for critical testing of major biological\r\nhypotheses in the areas of genetics, evolution, and physiology.\r\n\r\nThe scientific community showed great interest in the biosatellite\r\nprogram, and scientists from universities, industry, and Government have\r\nsubmitted 185 flight experiments involving primates and other mammals,\r\nvertebrate and invertebrate animals, micro-organisms, and plants.\r\n\r\nThe selected biosatellite experiments include studies at the cellular,\r\ntissue, and organism levels, including embryological development and\r\ngrowth experiments at the tissue level and physiological, behavioral,\r\nreproductive, and genetic studies at the organism level. The experiments\r\nare divided into six categories:\r\n\r\n  (1) Primates\r\n  (2) Mammals (nonprimate)\r\n  (3) Animal, cellular, and egg\r\n  (4) Plant morphogenesis, photosynthesis, and growth\r\n  (5) Biorhythm\r\n  (6) Radiation\r\n\r\nTwenty experiments have been selected for flight to study the effects of\r\nweightlessness and decreased gravity during 3- to 30-day orbital\r\nperiods. The experiments include a wide variety of plants and animals\r\nfrom single-celled organisms to higher plants and animals. The effects\r\nof weightlessness on the primate will be studied, especially the central\r\nnervous, the cardiovascular, and the skeletal systems during 30-day\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been selected to study the genetic and somatic effects\r\nof weightlessness combined with a known source of radiation (Sr⁸⁵) to\r\ndetermine if there are any antagonistic or synergistic effects\r\n([ref.172]). Experiments are also included for studying the effects of\r\nthe unique environment of the Earth-orbiting satellite and removal from\r\nthe Earth’s rotation in relation to biological rhythms of plants and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSix biosatellites are included in the presently approved program, with\r\nthe first flight in 1966. They will be launched from Cape Kennedy by the\r\nimproved two-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta into a nearly equatorial\r\ncircular orbit at an altitude of 180-200 miles for periods up to 30\r\ndays. Recovery will be by Air Force airplane during capsule/parachute\r\ndescent. The spacecraft weigh 1000-1200 pounds, have a 280-pound\r\nrecoverable capsule and, while in orbit, will not experience greater\r\nthan 1/10 000 g of acceleration. The life-support system will provide an\r\nenvironment at sea-level pressure of 80 percent nitrogen, 20 percent\r\noxygen, and no more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide with a temperature\r\nof 75° F ±5° F.\r\n\r\nAll experiments are in various stages of development or testing and\r\nflight test hardware has been and is being constructed. The experiments\r\nand hardware are being subjected to preflight tests simulating launch\r\nand recovery stresses. Rhesus, pigtail, and squirrel monkeys have been\r\nsubjected to the dynamic forces of the simulated flight under conditions\r\nof complete, partial, and no restraint. Three types of centrifuges have\r\nbeen used to simulate the flight profile. Primates were fully\r\ninstrumented with deep brain electrode implants, implanted catheters,\r\nand other implanted sensors. During centrifugation, motion pictures were\r\ntaken. These primates were semirestrained in form-fitted couches which\r\nallowed movement of the body while facing the accelerative force in a\r\nventrodorsal position (eyeballs in). In this series of tests, all\r\nprimates were normal following the tests and exhibited no unusual\r\nbehavior or effects. X-rays showed that implanted catheters and\r\nelectrodes remained in place, and there were no movements causing tissue\r\ndamage. However, when the primates were placed with their backs toward\r\nthe accelerative force, dorsoventral (eyeballs out), the animals\r\nsuffered visible damage. At 6 g there was no visible stress, but at 8 g\r\nswelling of the lower eyelids was noticeable. At 11 g both eyelids were\r\nswollen shut. In the biosatellite program, primates will be placed in\r\nthe semirestraint couches in a position facing accelerative forces,\r\nventrodorsal (eyeballs in), to prevent these effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 7\r\n\r\n_Manned Space Flight_\r\n\r\n\r\n                  BIOREGENERATIVE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nPlacing a man in space requires a complete life-support system capable\r\nof supplying sufficient oxygen, food, and water and removing excess\r\ncarbon dioxide, water vapor, and human body wastes. In addition, the\r\noxygen, carbon dioxide, and pressure must be maintained at a suitable\r\nlevel. Any accumulated toxic products and noxious odors must be removed.\r\n\r\nIn the spacecraft the human is confined in a restricted environment in\r\nwhich it is necessary to establish a balanced microcosm or closed\r\necological system. This is an enormous biological and bioengineering\r\nproblem. Weight, size, simplicity of operation, and reliability\r\nparticularly are important factors.\r\n\r\nFor relatively short missions involving one or several astronauts, food,\r\noxygen, and water can be stored and made available as required, and the\r\nvarious waste products can be stored. On longer missions, particularly\r\nthose involving more than one astronaut, efficient chemical or\r\nbiological regenerative systems will be required. Any regenerative\r\nsystem introduces a fixed cost in weight of processing equipment and\r\nenergy requirements.\r\n\r\nChemical, or partially regenerative, methods for providing breathing\r\noxygen by the regeneration of metabolic products such as water vapor and\r\ncarbon dioxide include the thermal decomposition of water and CO₂,\r\nphotolysis and radiolysis of water, electrolysis of fused carbonates and\r\naqueous solutions, and the chemical reduction of CO₂ with H₂, followed\r\nby electrolysis of the water formed. Chemical regenerative systems have\r\nbeen developed to remove excess carbon dioxide and water vapor from the\r\natmosphere. Nonbiological regenerative systems are time limited by the\r\namount of food, water, and oxygen that can be carried or recovered.\r\nThese physical-chemical processes show great potential, but they also\r\npresent many difficulties, including requirements for extremely high\r\ntemperatures and considerable amounts of power, the formation of highly\r\ntoxic materials, and high susceptibility to inactivation. None of the\r\npresently studied nonbiological processes can function as completely as\r\na bioregenerative system. All these nonbiological systems have\r\nunrealistic supply requirements and produce unusable wastes.\r\nConsequently, for long planetary missions the bioregenerative systems,\r\nthough also beset with problems, are potentially far superior to their\r\nphysical and chemical counterparts.\r\n\r\nTable VIII shows average daily metabolic data for a 70-kg astronaut. A\r\nman breathes about 10 cubic feet of air per minute, or 400 000 liters,\r\ndaily. The expired air contains about 4 percent carbon dioxide. Man\r\nnormally breathes air containing 0.03 percent CO₂, but can withstand\r\ncomfortably about 1.5 percent CO₂. Anything in excess of 1.5 percent\r\nwill produce labored breathing, headaches, and, if greatly exceeded,\r\ndeath. A man exhales about 1.1 pounds of water per day and this, in\r\naddition to water from perspiration and other sources, must be removed\r\nfrom the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Table VIII.—_Average Daily Metabolic Data for a 70-kg,\r\n       25-Year-Old Astronaut With Normal Spacecrew Activity_\r\n                        [From [ref.173]]\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  O₂ input, kg                                               0.862\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  CO₂ output, kg                                             1.056\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Drinking water, liters                                       2.5\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Food rehydrating water, liters                                 1\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Caloric value of food, kcal                                 3000\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Water output:\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Urine, liters                                           1.6\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Respiration and perspiration, liters                   2.13\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Feces, kg                                              0.09\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total heat output, Btu                                    11 100\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo types of biological regenerative systems have been proposed. The\r\nphotosynthetic closed ecological system was proposed as early as 1951.\r\nThis involves the use of single-celled algae or higher plants, including\r\nfloating aquatic and terrestrial plants, and requires the interaction of\r\nlight energy with CO₂ and H₂O to produce O₂ and plant cells. Another\r\nsystem, proposed in 1961, involves electrolysis of water into oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, and the concurrent use of _Hydrogenomonas_ bacteria which take\r\nup hydrogen, some oxygen, carbon dioxide, and urine yielding water and\r\nbacterial cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Table IX.—_Requirements for Regenerative Life-Support Systems_\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                   Requirements /      Requirements /\r\n                                       1 man⁴        3 men (270 man-day\r\n            System                                        mission)⁵\r\n                                ---------------------------------------\r\n                                  Weight,   Power,     Weight,   Power,\r\n                                  kg        kW         kg        kW\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Partial chemoregenerative                            ⁷ 332      1.75\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       LiOH                         125      1.40\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       NaOH                         155      7.68\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       CO₂-H₂                        34       .36\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Full bioregenerative—algae:\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Artificial illumination      116   ⁶ 10.40        591     25.00\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       Solar illumination           103      1.70        356       .60\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Electrolysis-_hydrogenomonas_      55       .25        129      2.60\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n   ⁴ From [ref.174].\r\n\r\n   ⁵ From [ref.175].\r\n\r\n   ⁶ From [ref.176].\r\n\r\n   ⁷ Includes instrumentation and food storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe values given in table IX indicate relative weights and powers\r\nrequired by various systems to provide the gaseous environment for\r\nmanned space cabins. If one considers operating temperatures and\r\nhazards, other systems may offer advantages which offset the weight and\r\npower advantages of the hydrogen reduction of LiOH systems.\r\n\r\nResearch is being conducted by NASA on life-support-system technology\r\napplicable to missions planned for 20 years in the future. Life-support\r\nsystems include the requirements for supplying breathing gases, control\r\nof contaminants in the cabin atmosphere, water reclamation, food supply,\r\nand personal hygiene. The disciplines involved in such systems include\r\nbiology and microbiology, cryogenic fluid handling at zero g, heat\r\ntransfer, and thermal integration with other systems, such as power. The\r\nphysiological, psychological, and sociological problems of the crew are\r\nalso being considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotosynthetic System\r\n\r\nGreen plants contain chlorophyll which captures light energy\r\nthermodynamically required to convert carbon dioxide and water into\r\ncarbohydrate which can subsequently be transformed into other foods such\r\nas protein and fat. During this process, carbon dioxide is consumed, and\r\nan approximately equal amount of oxygen gas is liberated. As a first\r\napproximation, photosynthesis is the reverse of the oxidative metabolism\r\nof animal life:\r\n\r\n                 Oxidation\r\n    C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂  ———————>  6CO₂ + 6H₂O + heat\r\n\r\n                       Photosynthesis\r\n    6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light  ———————>  C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\r\n\r\nThe photosynthetic process in plants and respiration during\r\nphotosynthesis have been studied intensively, and several metabolic\r\npathways have been elucidated. Mechanisms are being studied to explain\r\nthe inhibitory effect of strong visible light on this process. This\r\nprogram may lead to the use of chloroplasts or chlorophyll without cells\r\nin future photosynthetic bioregenerative systems for long-term space\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nOne of the prime considerations of a closed ecological system is that\r\nthe environmental gases shall remain physiologically tolerable to all of\r\nthe ecologic components. Ideally, a photosynthetic gas exchange organism\r\nshould possess a high ratio of gas exchange to total mass (considering\r\nall equipment and material incidental to growth, harvesting, processing,\r\nand utilization); and a controllable assimilation rate to maintain\r\nsteady-state gas composition. It should also be (1) amenable to\r\nconfining quarters which may be imposed by inflexibility of rocket or\r\nspace station design; (2) genetically and physiologically stable and\r\nhighly resistant to anticipated stresses; (3) edible and capable of\r\nsupplying most or all human nutritional requirements; (4) capable of\r\nutilizing raw or appropriately treated organic wastes; and (5) amenable\r\nto water recycling as demanded by other components of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigher Plants\r\n\r\nEfforts to utilize multicellular plants as photosynthetic gas exchangers\r\nhave been somewhat neglected, since it has been assumed by many that\r\nalgae would be more efficient. The family _Lemnaceae_ (duckweeds) are\r\nsmall primitive aquatic plants with a minimum of tissue differentiation.\r\nPractically all of the cells of the plant contain chlorophyll and are\r\ncapable of photosynthetic activity. They reproduce principally by\r\nasexual budding of parent leaflike fronds. They can be grown readily on\r\nmoist surfaces ([ref.177]) on almost any medium suitable for the growth\r\nof autotrophic plants. With duckweeds the problems of gaseous exchange\r\nand harvesting are simplified and the volume of medium can be greatly\r\ndecreased as compared with algae.\r\n\r\nNey ([ref.177]) obtained a very high gas exchange rate with duckweeds.\r\nUsing small cultures under controlled optimal conditions of temperature,\r\nlight (600-1000 ft-c), and CO₂, concentration, he estimated that 2.3 m²\r\nof frondal surface of duckweed, at a gas exchange rate of 10.8 liters\r\nm²/hr would provide sufficient gas exchange for one man. This would\r\nproduce about 25 grams of dry plant material per hour.\r\n\r\nA few nutritional studies have been carried out with duckweeds. Nakamura\r\n([ref.178]) considered _Wolffia_ as a possible source of food for space\r\ntravel and found that it contained carbohydrate 25-60 percent, protein\r\n8-10 percent, fat 18-20 percent, minerals 6-8 percent (all dry weights),\r\nand vitamins B₂, B₆, and C, with C the most abundant.\r\n\r\nOne of the desirable features of a duckweed system is that the gas\r\nexchange is direct between the atmosphere and the plant and does not\r\nrequire dissolving the respiratory gases in a bulky fluid system which\r\nintroduces special engineering difficulties in zero- or low-gravity\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn the design of equipment for photosynthetic studies, careful\r\nconsideration should be given to the material used in the construction\r\nof the unit. Most plastic materials are subject to photo-oxidative\r\ndegradation, with CO as one of the products. When air is recirculated\r\nthrough plastic tubing and transparent rigid plastics in the presence of\r\nlight, considerable quantities of CO are given off. With high-intensity\r\nillumination such as sunlight, a CO buildup of several hundred parts per\r\nmillion is not uncommon. Also, plant pigments such as the carotenoids\r\nand chlorophylls will react similarly when exposed to light of high\r\nintensity. If the plants die, then CO is released quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt Colorado State University the responses of plants to high-intensity\r\nradiation (ultraviolet to infrared) are being studied. Plants from high\r\nmountaintops that are exposed to greater ultraviolet light are being\r\nstudied for specialized adaptations. The effect of temperature on\r\nphotosynthesis is being explored. Various plants are also being studied\r\nunder germ-free conditions.\r\n\r\nScreening of higher plants for possible use in bioregenerative systems\r\nat Connecticut Agriculture Experiment Station resulted in the selection\r\nof corn, sugarcane, and sunflower. Under optimal conditions it has been\r\nshown that 100 to 130 ft² of leaf surface are required to support an\r\nastronaut.\r\n\r\nPlants considered as possible food sources include soybeans, peanuts,\r\nrice, and tomatoes, which can be combined with algae to give a\r\nwell-balanced and reasonably varied diet. Hydroponic systems use large\r\nquantities of water, but progress is being made in reducing this.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of using animals in the closed ecological system is open\r\nto question, particularly in the absence of gravity, and much work\r\nremains to be done on using plant materials as animal food and on the\r\ndisposal of wastes. Animals which have been considered are crustaceans,\r\nfish, chickens, rabbits, and goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgae\r\n\r\nAlgae have the fastest growth rate and are among the most efficient\r\nplants for oxygen and food production. It has been amply demonstrated by\r\nMyers ([ref.179]) and other workers that _Chlorella_ can be used in a\r\nclosed ecological system to maintain animals such as mice and a monkey.\r\nThe use of algae for supplying O₂ and food, and for removing CO₂ and\r\nodors has been considered by many authors for use in spacecraft, space\r\nplatforms, and for establishing bases on the Moon or Mars.\r\n\r\nEstimates of total efficiency are based on extrapolated laboratory data\r\nand vary widely, since many different types of data have been used as a\r\nbasis for these estimates.\r\n\r\nThe respired air containing about 4-5 percent CO₂ is bubbled into the\r\n_Chlorella_ culture, at either atmospheric or increased pressure. Air\r\ncontaining a high percentage of oxygen and saturated with moisture is\r\nreleased from the algal system.\r\n\r\nThe use of algae for several purposes might require from one to three\r\nseparate algal systems. For food production, _Chlorella_ produces 50\r\npercent protein and 50 percent lipids in high-nitrogen media. In\r\nlow-nitrogen media, it produces 85 percent lipids. Proper choice of\r\n_Chlorella_ strains and media will produce not only the necessary\r\ncalories but also the necessary specific nutrients required. Certain\r\nstrains are more effective in O₂ production, and others in the use of\r\nurine and other wastes.\r\n\r\nSome of the early estimates, using _Chlorella_ grown at 25° C, for\r\nsupplying these requirements for a single man in space include the\r\nfollowing: 168 kg of algal suspension ([ref.179]), 200 kg of algal\r\nsuspension and 50 kg of equipment including pumps (refs. [ref.180] and\r\n[ref.181]), and 100 kg of algal suspension and 50 cubic feet for\r\nequipment and gas exchange ([ref.182]). Using the blue-green alga\r\n_Synechocystis_, 600 kg of algal suspension would be required, according\r\nto Gafford and Craft. These estimates are based on preliminary studies,\r\nare quite high, and are not of real practical value.\r\n\r\nOther studies have indicated an extremely efficient algal system which\r\noffers a real potential for a practical and effective gas exchanger\r\n([ref.183]). A thermophilic strain of _Chlorella_ with an optimum growth\r\ntemperature of 39° C and an optimum temperature for photosynthesis of\r\nabout 40° C can increase its cell mass 10 000-fold per day. When\r\noperating at one-half maximum efficiency, this alga produces 100 times\r\nits cell volume of oxygen per hour. Burk et al. ([ref.183]) state:\r\n\"Future engineering development should lead to a space requirement, per\r\nadult person, of no more than 3 to 5 cubic feet of algal culture,\r\nequipment, and instrumentation for adequate purification of air.\" The\r\nrequirements of this system would require additional energy in the form\r\nof light and of small amounts of nitrogenous and mineral material for\r\nthe algae. The light source used by Burk et al. ([ref.183]) is a\r\ntungsten filament quartz lamp the size of a pencil, which has a long\r\nlife, produces a luminous flux 5-10 times greater than sunlight on\r\nEarth, and operates at a 10-12 percent light efficiency.\r\n\r\nResearch is being carried out on algal regenerative systems by about 40\r\nor 50 laboratories in the United States. NASA is supporting several\r\nbasic studies on photosynthesis, the physiology of algae, and\r\nengineering pilot-plant development. Much of the research on algae is\r\nbeing supported by the Air Force.\r\n\r\nMost algal studies have been carried out in small units and the data\r\nobtained have been used as a basis for extrapolating logistic values for\r\nthe use of these organisms in manned space vehicles. Myers ([ref.179])\r\nhas shown that the quantity of algae necessary to support a man (with an\r\nassumed O₂ requirement of 625 liters per day) would yield about 600-700\r\ngrams dry weight of new cells per day. If algal growth in mass cultures\r\ncould be maintained in a steady-state concentration of 2.5 gram dry\r\nweight per liter with such a growth rate as to yield 10 grams weight per\r\nliter per day, the volume of algal culture would be 60-70 liters and the\r\ntotal mass of the system would approximate 200-250 pounds.\r\n\r\nUsing an 8-liter system, Ward et al. ([ref.176]) have produced algal\r\nconcentrations of 5-7 grams of dry algae per liter with a\r\nhigh-temperature algal strain. The maximum growth rate observed with the\r\nculture was 0.375 gram dry weight per liter per hour, or 9 grams dry\r\nweight per liter per day. This was accomplished by using 1-centimeter\r\nlayers of culture and a light intensity of 8000 foot-candles. The\r\nculture system consisted of a rectangular plastic chamber having an area\r\nof 0.5 square meter and illuminated on each side to an intensity of 4000\r\nfoot-candles (cool-white). To produce 25 liters of oxygen per hour, an\r\narea of 8.3 square meters (85 square feet) would be required.\r\n\r\nThe major problem in large-scale production of algae is that of\r\nillumination. Conversion of electricity to light has an efficiency of\r\nonly 10 to 20 percent. In addition, the maximum efficiency of light\r\nutilization by _Chlorella_ algae lies in the range of 18-22 percent.\r\nThis results in a maximum efficiency of only 4 percent for\r\nphotosynthetic systems. Another problem involved in conversion of\r\nelectricity to light is the production of heat which has to be removed\r\neven with thermophilic algae. With a human demand of 600 liters of\r\noxygen per day, the minimum electrical requirement becomes 4 kW. No\r\nlarge-scale culture has yet been managed at anything close to this\r\nminimum figure.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is the poor penetration of light into concentrated\r\ncultures of algae. This necessitates construction of large tanks of only\r\nabout ¼-inch thickness. This results frequently in fouling of the\r\nsurfaces of the tank by algae and makes the removal of the excess algae\r\ndifficult. Production of 1 liter of oxygen results in the production of\r\n1 gram dry weight of algae. Although a small amount of CO is produced by\r\nsome algae, it can probably be removed by catalytic oxidation. Other\r\nproblems include mutation and genetic drift of the algae and the\r\nnecessity for maintaining bacteria-free cultures. There are also\r\ndifficulties in maintaining a sterile culture if urine is to be used as\r\na nitrogen source. While there is a potential for using algae as food,\r\nmore research is required before it can be determined what quantity and\r\nmethods of processing can be used. Research and development on algae is\r\nmuch greater than on both the higher plants and the\r\nelectrolysis-_Hydrogenomonas_ systems together.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the photosynthetic and\r\nelectrolysis-chemosynthetic systems is the way electrical energy is made\r\navailable to the organisms. In the photosynthetic system, electrical\r\nenergy is converted to light which the algae or plants transform into\r\nchemical energy. In the chemosynthetic process, electrical energy is\r\ntransformed into the chemical energy of hydrogen gas which is used by\r\nthe bacteria. Both organisms use the chemical energy available to them\r\nto synthesize cell material with similar degrees of efficiency. The\r\nproblem is to make the conversion of electricity to available chemical\r\nenergy as efficient as possible.\r\n\r\nIn photosynthetic systems much energy is lost in the conversion of\r\nelectricity to light, a process only 10-20 percent efficient at best.\r\nWhen this is combined with the loss from the inefficient use of light by\r\nplants, an overall efficiency of about 4 percent is obtained. In the\r\nelectrolysis-_Hydrogenomonas_ system, the two steps are very efficient.\r\nElectrolysis cells can operate at up to 85 percent efficiency and the\r\noverall efficiency can be up to seven times that of a photosynthetic\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ELECTROLYSIS-_HYDROGENOMONAS_ SYSTEM\r\n\r\nElectrolysis is carried out in a closed unit containing an electrolyte\r\n(KOH solution) with an anode and a cathode. These cells produce a\r\nmaximum yield (60-80 percent or more) in gas production per unit of\r\npower consumption. According to Dole and Tamplin ([ref.184]), a unit\r\ncapable of producing enough oxygen to sustain one man would be highly\r\nreliable, weigh approximately 18 kg, and require a power input of 0.25\r\nkW.\r\n\r\nOne approach to zero-gravity operation is to rotate the electrolysis\r\ncell as described by Clifford and McCallum ([ref.185]) and Clifford and\r\nFaust ([ref.186]). The smallest known electrolysis cell under\r\ndevelopment uses this artificial gravity to separate oxygen from the\r\nanode and electrolyte, while the dry hydrogen gas permeates through the\r\nfoil cathode, fabricated from palladium-silver alloy. This electrolysis\r\ncell, which would provide breathing oxygen for three men, has a volume\r\nof 1.4 liters, weighs 4.5 kg, and requires 0.67 kW, excluding auxiliary\r\nequipment, and has an efficiency of 84 percent.\r\n\r\nThe chemosynthetic conversion is carried out by the hydrogen bacteria.\r\nBy the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, supplied from the electrolysis\r\nof water, energy is made available for biosynthesis. The generation of\r\nthis \"biological energy\" is mediated by the stable enzyme hydrogenase\r\nwhich is present in the bacteria. On the average, the oxidation of 4\r\nmoles of H₂ is required for the conversion of 1 mole of CO₂ (the hourly\r\nproduction of a man). The removal of this amount of CO₂ would thus\r\nrequire the cleavage of 4 moles of water. In addition, to supply oxygen\r\nfor human respiration (at a rate of 1 mole of O₂ per hour) the cleavage\r\nof two additional moles of water is required. Therefore, the\r\nchemosynthetic regeneration and human respiration together would\r\nrequire, on the average, the splitting of 6 moles of water per hour.\r\n\r\nThe material balance for electrolysis, biosynthesis, and human\r\nmetabolism, with gram molecular weights in parentheses, are shown in\r\nequations (1) to (3), respectively:\r\n\r\n     6H₂O ———————>  3O₂ + 6H₂\r\n    (108) ———————> (96) + (12)                    (1)\r\n\r\nThe bacterial synthesis requires 6 moles of H₂, 2 moles of O₂, and 1\r\nmole of CO₂ (from the astronaut), as shown in equation 2:\r\n\r\n      6H₂ + 2O₂ + CO₂  ———————> CH₂O + 5H₂O\r\n    (12) + (64) + (44) ———————> (30) + (90)       (2)\r\n\r\nThe respiration of the astronaut requires 1 \"food\" mole (CH₂O)\r\nrepresenting about 120 kcal, and 1 mole of O₂, as shown in equation 3:\r\n\r\n     CH₂O +  O₂  ———————> CO₂  + H₂O\r\n     (30) + (32) ———————> (44) + (18)             (3)\r\n\r\nThe metabolic data in table VIII show that the CO₂ of the astronaut and\r\nthe bacteria must balance at about 1.056 kg per day.\r\n\r\nThe water relations are not completely balanced, but are fairly close.\r\nAbout 2.6 liters per day of water are split by electrolysis. The\r\nastronaut has an intake of 3.5 liters of water per day, 2.5 liters for\r\ndrinking and 1 liter for preparing dehydrated food. The output is about\r\n1.6 liters of urine and 2.1 liters of water of respiration and\r\nperspiration per day, or a total output of 3.7 liters, with the\r\n0.2-liter excess due mainly to water of metabolism. The\r\nbacteria-produced water, amounting to 2.2 liters per day, and the excess\r\nfrom the astronaut would supply 2.4 liters toward balancing the 2.6\r\nliters of water electrolyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacterial Culture\r\n\r\nHydrogen bacteria are characterized by their ability to metabolize and\r\nmultiply in a strictly inorganic medium, when supplied with H₂, CO₂ and\r\nO₂ in required amounts. They can be grown in batch culture or in\r\ncontinuous culture using different methods of supplying entire medium or\r\ncomponents on a demand feed system.\r\n\r\nA medium was developed for batch culture of _Hydrogenomonas eutropha_ by\r\nRepaske ([ref.187]) with quantitation of a number of components\r\nincluding trace minerals. Experiments by Bongers ([ref.188]) showed that\r\na simplified medium, using laboratory-grade chemicals, could be used. A\r\ndefinite requirement was found for magnesium and ferrous iron (Fe⁺⁺).\r\nThe optimal growth requirements observed for _Hydrogenomonas eutropha_\r\nare shown in table X.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Table X.—_Optimum Growth Requirements of_\r\n                   Hydrogenomonas eutropha\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n         Culture parameter                   Optimum value\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cell density, g (dry weight)/liter              10\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature, °C                                 35\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Pressure, atm                                    1\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  pH (phosphate buffer)                       6.8 (6.4-8.0)\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  H₂, percent                                     75\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  O₂, percent                                     15\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  CO₂, percent                                    10\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Urea CO(NH₂)₂, g/liter                           1\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  MgSO₄·7H₂O, g/liter                              0.1\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Fe(NH₄)₂(SO₄)₂, g/liter                          0.008\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of temperatures ranging from 20° to 42.5° C on the growth\r\nrates of _Hydrogenomonas eutropha_ were studied by Bongers ([ref.189]),\r\nand the optimal temperature was found to be about 35° C. Experiments at\r\n25° and 35° C indicated that the efficiency of energy conversion was\r\nessentially identical at both temperatures. _Hydrogenomonas_ requires,\r\nas part of its substrate, a mixture of three gases: hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nand carbon dioxide. Experiments were performed by Bongers ([ref.189]) to\r\ndetermine the toleration limits of the three gases. Growth rates were\r\nfound to be identical when hydrogen varied from 5 to 80 percent. Nearly\r\nidentical growth was obtained when CO₂ partial pressures were 5 to 60\r\npercent, being slightly lower at higher partial pressures. The organism\r\nwas highly sensitive to oxygen concentration. Dissolved oxygen\r\nconcentrations above 0.13 mM were found to inhibit cell division; energy\r\nutilization was also affected by oxygen concentration. At 0.2 mM oxygen\r\nconcentration, the efficiency of energy conversion was approximately\r\nhalf the value observed with 0.05 mM.\r\n\r\nAnother parameter of importance is the total volume of suspension which\r\nwould be required to balance the metabolic needs of one man. The volume\r\nof suspension is determined by the conversion capacity of a unit volume.\r\nThis capacity is a function of the cell concentration; hence, the more\r\ncells that can be packed in a unit volume of suspension (and adequately\r\nprovided with H₂, O₂, and CO₂), the less the volume of suspension\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nResults of experiments by Bongers (refs. [ref.190] and [ref.191]) on\r\nconversion capacity-density relationships show that the rate of CO₂\r\nconversion obtained with suspensions up to approximately 10 grams (dry\r\nweight) per liter is linear with relation to density. This indicates\r\nthat the supply of H₂, O₂, and CO₂ is adequate. Upon a further increase\r\nin cell concentration, the conversion rate still increases but not\r\nlinearly. The highest amount of CO₂ taken up per liter of suspension was\r\napproximately 2 liters per hour. At these very high cell concentrations,\r\nthe relationship between rate of conversion and density is no longer\r\nlinear. This is demonstrated when the conversion rate is calculated per\r\nunit cell weight instead of per unit suspension volume. The rate per\r\ngram dry weight per liter decreases from 146 to 68 ml of CO₂ per hour.\r\nWith a suspension at a density of approximately 10 grams, the conversion\r\nof 1.1 liters of CO₂ per liter per hour is obtained. At a CO₂ output of\r\n22 liters per man per hour, 20 liters of suspension would be sufficient\r\nto balance the gas exchange needs of one man.\r\n\r\nAt higher cell concentrations, less volume of suspension would suffice\r\nif gas equilibration could be maintained at the higher consumption rates\r\nto avoid anaerobic conditions which could lead to a shift in metabolism.\r\nIn the final analysis, the technical problem of gas transfer from the\r\ngas to the liquid phase determines the optimal cell concentration and,\r\ntherefore, the required suspension volume.\r\n\r\nFrom data presently available, it can be concluded that, using the\r\nslow-growing _H. facilis_, the volume of suspension required to support\r\none man is about 500 liters. Using _H. eutropha_, Schlegel ([ref.192])\r\ncalculated a suspension volume of 66 liters with 1 gram dry weight of\r\nbacteria per liter.\r\n\r\nIn recent NASA-supported research, the amount of culture medium has been\r\nestimated using improved cultivation methods and conditions. For batch\r\nculture, the data show that from 10 to 66 liters would be required per\r\nman, with a best practical estimate of 20 liters at 9 to 10 grams dry\r\nweight of bacteria per liter ([ref.191]). For continuous culture using\r\nthe turbidostat, the present data indicate a demand for some 30 liters\r\nof suspension, and a volume of 20 liters (at approximately 10 grams dry\r\nweight of bacteria per liter) as a realistic goal.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing section, the material balance for gases and water was\r\ndiscussed. It was shown that a close match could be obtained with these\r\ncomponents of the closed environment.\r\n\r\nLess abundant, though no less important, are the nonwater components of\r\nurine and feces. The urine is important for the content of fixed\r\nnitrogen and other products of man’s metabolism and serves as a very\r\neffective substrate for cultivation of hydrogen bacteria. Maximum\r\nclosure of the system necessitates utilization of the urea in urine as a\r\nnitrogen source.\r\n\r\nThe average man produces 1.2 to 1.6 liters of urine per 24-hour period.\r\nThis contains about 0.00005 gram per liter of iron, 0.113 gram per liter\r\nof magnesium, and 24.5 grams per liter of urea ([ref.193]). As shown in\r\ntable X, each liter of bacterial medium requires 0.008 gram per liter of\r\nFe(NH₄)₂(SO₄)₂, about 0.1 gram of MgSO₄·7H₂O, and 1.0 gram per liter of\r\nurea. In comparing the daily urine output with the estimated required\r\ningredients of a bacterial medium, a relatively close balance is\r\nobserved, with the exception of iron.\r\n\r\nFor the fixation of 24 moles of CO₂ (288 grams of C) produced per man\r\nper day, the production of about 640 grams dry bacterial mass is\r\nrequired. At an average N-content of 12 percent, the nitrogen\r\nrequirement would be some 100 grams. A comparison of daily output\r\n(urine) and daily requirement by the bacterial suspension reveals that\r\nonly 10 to 33 percent of this amount could be recovered from average\r\nurine. To obtain a material balance, either the man must be fed a\r\nprotein-rich diet or the bacterial suspension must be grown under\r\nconditions which lead to the production of a cell mass relatively low in\r\nprotein content. Experiments have indicated that nitrogen starvation of\r\nthe bacterial culture might be a promising solution. Culture \"staging\"\r\n(cultivation under nitrogen-rich conditions, followed by cultivation in\r\nthe absence of substrate nitrogen and subsequent harvesting for food\r\nprocessing) will probably be the most promising means of nitrogen\r\neconomy in the closed environment. As discussed in a following section,\r\na biomass of relatively high lipid content can be obtained under\r\nconditions of nitrogen starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuous Culture of _Hydrogenomonas_ Bacteria\r\n\r\nGrowth of hydrogen bacteria in a batch culture, after an initial period\r\nof adjustment, becomes steady and rapid during the exponential growth\r\nphase. This steady state of growth is temporary and ceases when nutrient\r\nsubstrate or gas concentrations drop to limiting values. For long\r\nperiods a continual supply of nutrients must be provided. Growth then\r\noccurs under steady-state conditions for prolonged periods, and such\r\nfactors as pH, concentration of nutrient, oxygen, and metabolic products\r\n(which change during batch culture) are all maintained constant in\r\ncontinuous culture.\r\n\r\nTwo methods can be used for control of continuous cultures: the\r\nturbidostat and the chemostat. In the turbidostat, regulation of medium\r\ninput and cell concentration is controlled by optically sensing the\r\nturbidity of the culture.\r\n\r\nThe dilution rate varies with the population density of the culture and\r\nmaintains the density within a narrow range. Organisms grow at the\r\nmaximum rate characteristic of the organism and the conditions. The\r\ngrowth rate can be changed by modifying the nutrient medium, gas\r\nconcentration, or incubation temperature. A disadvantage of the\r\nturbidostat is that all nutrient concentrations in the culture chamber\r\nare necessarily higher than the minimum, resulting in inefficient\r\nutilization of nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe turbidostat system for continuous culture of _Hydrogenomonas_\r\nbacteria, developed by Battelle Memorial Institute ([ref.194]), includes\r\nelectrolysis of water in a separate unit. Hydrogen and oxygen are fed\r\nseparately up to the point of injection into the culture vessel, and the\r\nmixed volume is kept very small to minimize am possibility of explosion.\r\nHowever, the two gases may be injected simultaneously if there is a\r\ndemand for both.\r\n\r\nIn the chemostat, growth of the organisms is limited by maintaining one\r\nessential nutrient concentration below optimum. A constant feed of\r\nmedium, with one nutrient in limiting concentration and with constant\r\nremoval of culture at the same rate, is used to achieve the steady\r\nstate. The dilution rate is set at an arbitrary value, and the microbial\r\npopulation is allowed to find its own level. By appropriate setting of\r\nthe dilution rate, the growth rate may be held at any desired value from\r\nslightly below the maximum possible to nearly zero. This constitutes a\r\nself-regulating system and allows selection of a desired growth rate.\r\n\r\nA combined electrolysis-chemostat method, developed by Magna Corp.,\r\nmaintained the hydrogen-producing electrode of an electrolysis cell in\r\nthe bacterial culture. Resting cells of _Hydrogenomonas eutropha_\r\nconsumed hydrogen produced at the cathode of an electrolysis cell built\r\ninto a specially constructed Warburg flask. Attempts to immobilize\r\n_Hydrogenomonas_ cells on a porous conductor were partially successful.\r\nThis system could lower the volume requirements compared with those for\r\nthe isolated subsystems. Disadvantages of this integrated system include\r\nelectrolysis of the bacterial medium, possibly resulting in toxic\r\nbreakdown products, and the possible effects of electric power and the\r\nKOH electrolyte on the bacteria. The main disadvantage of an integrated\r\nsystem would be the disparity between optimal conditions for efficient\r\nelectrolysis and efficient bacterial conversion, particularly\r\ntemperature and pH, with the combination possibly resulting in\r\nconsiderably higher power and weight demands.\r\n\r\nBoth continuous-culture approaches are being studied with NASA support.\r\nThe turbidostat offers the greatest potential efficiency in weight and\r\nvolume, but uses nutrient materials less efficiently and is more\r\ncomplex. The chemostat is less efficient in weight and volume, but has\r\ngreater simplicity and reliability.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogenomonas eutropha_ has been grown in 15-liter batch cultures and\r\nin 2.1-liter continuous cultures. A 20-liter continuous culture,\r\nsufficient to balance the requirements of a man, is under development.\r\n\r\nThe potential problem areas in large-scale continuous production of the\r\nbacteria include assuring genetic stability, preventing or controlling\r\nbacteriophage and foreign bacterial contamination, and preventing\r\nheterotrophic growth caused by exposure to organic material from the\r\nurine. Genetics of hydrogen bacteria and phage infection have been\r\nstudied by DeCicco. Research on these problems indicates that they are\r\nnot of major importance, but cause significant effects and must be\r\neliminated or controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacterial Composition and Nutrition\r\n\r\n_Hydrogenomonas_ bacteria can be used for at least part of the\r\nastronauts’ diet. The washed bacteria have a mild taste and are being\r\nstudied for their total energy content, protein and lipid digestibility,\r\nand vitamin content. Carbon and nitrogen balances, and respiratory\r\nquotient are to be determined in animals fed the bacteria as their sole\r\nfood source. No toxic constituents have been discovered. Sonicated and\r\ncooked bacteria, when fed to white rats as 12 percent of the solids of a\r\nnutritionally balanced diet, were eaten readily and produced no ill\r\neffects. Net utilization of the protein appears to be somewhat lower\r\nthan casein and about the same as legume proteins.\r\n\r\nThe composition of _Hydrogenomonas eutropha_ is shown in table XI. The\r\ncomposition of the bacteria varies with the age and growth phase of the\r\ncells and with the medium and gas available. It is possible to modify\r\nthe growth conditions to grow the type of bacteria desired for nutritive\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogenomonas_ cells contain about 75 percent water. Of the dry\r\nweight, about 74 percent is protein, calculated as 6.25 times the\r\nnitrogen content.

The most important lipid\r\nis poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which is stored under the growing\r\nconditions of insufficient nitrogen or oxygen supply (refs. [ref.187]\r\nand [ref.191]). Under these conditions, this unusual polymer constitutes\r\nup to 80 percent of the dry weight. While the monomer itself,\r\nbeta-hydroxybutyric acid, is rapidly and efficiently used in cell\r\nmetabolism, the nutritive value of the polymer is yet to be determined.\r\nThe fatty acids found include lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic,\r\nheptadecaenoic, C17 saturated(?), stearic, linoleic, and linolenic(?)\r\n([ref.195]).\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication to Spacecraft System\r\n\r\nA bioregenerative life-support system will be required in long manned\r\nspace flight, especially with several astronauts such as would be\r\nrequired for a manned mission to Mars in the 1980 time period. While\r\nalmost 15 years is a long leadtime, the biological research and\r\nengineering problems are formidable, and a system would have to be\r\ndeveloped at least 5 years before the mission.\r\n\r\nThe power and weight requirements for both chemical and biological\r\nregenerative life-support systems were presented in table VIII. These\r\nshould be considered tentative best estimates based on present data.\r\n\r\nThe use of bioregenerative systems in spacecraft systems has been\r\nstudied by Bongers and Kok ([ref.175]) who put the\r\nelectrolysis-_Hydrogenomonas_ system in proper perspective with the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n    The bioregenerative systems are more or less in a transitory\r\n    phase between research and development. The power data can be\r\n    considered fairly accurate, at least within ±20 percent. The\r\n    postulated weight data, however, represent approximations,\r\n    particularly with respect to auxiliary equipment and\r\n    construction materials. Also omitted are the weight penalties\r\n    most probably involved in the processing of the solid output of\r\n    the exchangers, elegantly defined as potential food. Further\r\n    research is required in this area to evaluate the regenerative\r\n    systems, especially the bacteria, with respect to this\r\n    potential. Furthermore, as yet there is no experimental proof\r\n    that the growth rates of the heavy bacterial suspensions can be\r\n    realized in a large design, determined on a relatively small\r\n    scale with fairly precise control of physiological conditions\r\n    and gas exchange. This aspect may affect considerably the weight\r\n    involved in a chemosynthetic balanced system. Nevertheless, at\r\n    present, this approach still seems most promising.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CABIN ATMOSPHERES⁹\r\n\r\n   ⁹ Includes part of [ref.196].\r\n\r\nIn the first U.S. manned space flight program, Project Mercury, and in\r\nthe face of very severe weight limitations, a cabin atmosphere of pure\r\noxygen at one-third atmospheric pressure was adopted. This choice\r\nprobably represented the greatest simplification which could be achieved\r\nreadily and, at the same time, provide protection against some of the\r\nrisks of rapid decompression. Although breathing pure oxygen at higher\r\npressures was known to be attended by some undesirable physiological\r\neffects, the short duration of the flights to be undertaken, and the low\r\npressure employed, suggested that no harmful results would result in\r\nthis case. That these expectations were generally borne out is now\r\nhistory. Preparations for space flights of longer duration—many weeks or\r\nmonths—present similar problems and require special attention to\r\nphenomena which may be either undetectable or of trivial significance on\r\na time scale of a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiological Criteria in the Choice of Cabin Atmosphere\r\n\r\nIf maintenance of normal respiratory function were the only\r\nconsideration, a cabin atmosphere of about sea-level composition and\r\npressure might be an ideal and straightforward choice for manned\r\nspacecraft. In fact, this atmosphere has been used in the manned space\r\nflights conducted by the U.S.S.R. No other atmosphere has been shown to\r\nbe more satisfactory from the physiological point of view, and the\r\ntedious respiratory studies which should accompany the use of other\r\natmospheres can be avoided. Nevertheless, the formidable problems of\r\nspacecraft design and the necessary precautions for safeguarding the\r\ncrew from accident require that other atmospheric compositions and\r\npressures be considered. For example, if a cabin at 1-atm pressure were\r\ndecompressed to space suit pressure (0.3 atm), the occupants would\r\ndevelop decompression sickness; i.e., \"bends.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral engineering considerations argue for low cabin pressures and\r\npure oxygen composition. Among these are structural design, weight of\r\natmospheric gas storage and control equipment, and the difficulty of\r\ncontriving pressure suits which allow operation at pressures near one\r\natmosphere. Such departures from the normal human gaseous environment,\r\nhowever, require the demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and\r\nphysiological performance.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the composition and pressure of acceptable cabin\r\natmospheres are then set by—\r\n\r\n  (1) A pure oxygen atmosphere at a pressure which will provide an\r\n      alveolar oxygen partial pressure equal to that provided by air at\r\n      sea level\r\n  (2) A mixed gas (oxygen and inert gas) atmosphere having a pressure\r\n      and composition that will allow decompression to the highest\r\n      acceptable suit pressure without the risk of bends\r\n\r\nA numerical value for the lower limit (1) is approximately 0.2 atm of\r\npure oxygen. The upper limit (2) is determined by the operating pressure\r\nand composition of the space-suit atmosphere and may be of the order of\r\n0.5 atm for a cabin atmosphere of 50 percent oxygen. It is necessary to\r\ndetermine the astronaut’s ability to survive and perform his duties in\r\nany atmosphere selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtelectasis and Pulmonary Edema\r\n\r\nLocalized or diffuse collapse of alveoli in the lungs may, if the\r\ncondition persists, lead to arterial hypoxia which may be extremely\r\nundesirable under the stresses of space flight. The alveoli are probably\r\nunstable when pure oxygen is breathed; they tend to collapse if there is\r\nblockage of the airways, especially at low pressures. This collapse\r\noccurs because each of the gases present in the alveoli (oxygen, water\r\nvapor, and carbon dioxide) is subject to prompt and complete absorption\r\nfrom the alveoli by the blood.\r\n\r\nThe alveoli are normally stabilized against collapse by the presence of\r\ninert and relatively insoluble gas (nitrogen) and an internal coating of\r\nlipoprotein substances with low surface tension.\r\n\r\nTheoretical and experimental results strongly suggest the desirability\r\nof using oxygen-inert gas atmospheres for long missions to avoid\r\natelectasis and other gas absorption phenomena, such as retraction of\r\nthe eardrum. However, further experimental evidence is required both to\r\nconfirm this point and to establish its upper limit of suitability of\r\npure oxygen atmospheres.\r\n\r\nAt Ohio State University in 1962, scientists studied the effect on young\r\nrats exposed for 27 days to 100 percent oxygen (with no nitrogen), at a\r\nreduced barometric pressure equivalent to 33 000 feet altitude. The rats\r\nshowed no difference in growth rate, oxygen consumption, food and water\r\nintake, or behavior from control rats in air at 1 atm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen Toxicity\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that breathing pure oxygen at normal atmospheric\r\npressure often produces pulmonary irritation and other toxic effects\r\nboth in man and animals. This knowledge has occasioned concern over the\r\nuse of pure oxygen atmospheres in spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThe effect of 100 percent oxygen at a simulated altitude of 26 000 feet\r\nfor 6 weeks was studied using white rats at Oklahoma City University\r\nunder a NASA grant. Radioactive carbon techniques revealed a 15-percent\r\nreduction of metabolism in the 100-percent oxygen-exposed rats, compared\r\nwith rats in air at 1 atmosphere. There was a 20-percent decrease in\r\nlipid metabolism in the liver compared with controls, but no decrease in\r\nheart metabolism. There was no gross change in body weight.\r\n\r\nThe White Leghorn chick between 2 and 7 weeks old is markedly resistant\r\nto the toxic effects of 1 atm of O₂. Continuous exposure (Ohio State\r\nUniversity) for as long as 4 weeks did not cause deaths, obvious\r\nmorbidity, or any signs of pulmonary damage on gross autopsy.\r\nNevertheless, the hyperoxia had some adverse effects, primarily reducing\r\nthe growth rate to between three-fourths to one-fourth of normal;\r\nreducing feed intake per unit body weight to three-fourths of normal;\r\nslowing respiratory rate by 30 percent; decreasing erythrocytes,\r\nhemoglobin, and hematocrit by 9 to 12 percent; and causing reversible\r\nhistological changes in the lungs. Arterial O₂ tensions were elevated\r\nover 300-mm Hg, but arterial pCO₂ and blood pH were unaffected. No\r\nresidual effects were noted upon return to air breathing. It is possible\r\nthat the anatomical peculiarities of the avian lung play some role in\r\nthe chicks’ resistance to hyperoxia, but it is also possible that this\r\nresistance is a function of age, similar to the tolerance shown by the\r\nyoung rat but not the adult.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon Dioxide Tolerance\r\n\r\nStudies of CO₂ tolerance in submarine crews indicate that no loss of\r\nperformance is involved if the concentration in air at normal pressure\r\ndoes not exceed 1.5 percent with exposures of 30 to 40 days. However,\r\nbiochemical adaptive changes were observed at this concentration.\r\n\r\n\r\nInert-Gas Components\r\n\r\nIf other investigations establish the need for an inert gas in manned\r\nspacecraft atmospheres, gases other than nitrogen may be considered.\r\nCompared with nitrogen, the physical properties or helium and neon offer\r\nadvantages with respect to solubility in body fluids, storage weight,\r\nand thermal properties.\r\n\r\nStudies at Ohio State University in 1964, under a NASA grant, showed\r\nthat helium substituted for nitrogen in a closed container causes humans\r\nto feel \"cold\" at a normally comfortable temperature. Studies with\r\nanimals have shown that in a helium atmosphere there is greater heat\r\nloss due to the increased conducting capacity and probably greater\r\nevaporative capacity. In 6 days at 21 percent oxygen and 79 percent\r\nhelium at 1-atmosphere pressure, young rats grew at the same rate as\r\ncontrols, but drank more water, excreted more urine, and had a higher\r\nrate of food and oxygen consumption than controls in air at 1\r\natmosphere. Men are being tested on a bicycle ergometer in saturated and\r\nlow relative humidity helium atmospheres to study heat balance.\r\n\r\nMice were exposed to 80 percent argon and 20 percent oxygen continuously\r\nat 1-atmosphere pressure for 35 days at Oklahoma City University. Carbon\r\n14 studies of metabolism showed a slight slowing and a twofold to\r\nthreefold increase in fat deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBends\r\n\r\nDecompression, whether accidental (due to damage of the spacecraft) or\r\nintentional (as in the use of the pressure suit outside the capsule),\r\ncarries the risk of bends if the inert gases dissolved in the tissues\r\nand body fluids come out of solution. The magnitude of this risk is\r\ndetermined to a very considerable extent by—\r\n\r\n  (1) Individual susceptibility\r\n  (2) The extent to which the nitrogen (or other inert gas)\r\n      concentrations of tissues and body fluids have been reduced\r\n  (3) The magnitude and rate of the inert-gas, partial pressure change\r\n      on decompression\r\n\r\nThe probability of getting bends is reduced by—\r\n\r\n  (1) Selection of bends-resistant individuals\r\n  (2) Thorough denitrogenation before flight\r\n  (3) Limitation of decompressive pressure changes by appropriate choice\r\n      of cabin atmosphere pressure and composition\r\n  (4) Space-suit pressure setting\r\n\r\nIn some cases, further improvements might be obtained by using, in the\r\ncabin atmosphere, an inert-gas component which has a lower solubility in\r\ntissue and body fluids or less tendency than nitrogen to form bubbles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFire Hazard\r\n\r\nExperience indicates that fires in pure oxygen atmospheres, even at low\r\npressures (e.g., 1/3 atm), are extremely difficult to extinguish. While\r\nthis phenomenon has nothing to do with respiratory physiology, the risk\r\non flights of long duration may be so serious as to demand special\r\nmeasures. Unless effective countermeasures can be devised, this risk may\r\nargue very strongly against the use of such atmospheres in the future.\r\nFurther experimental investigation is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcceleration Effects on the Lungs and Pulmonary Circulation\r\n\r\nForces produced by high acceleration overdistend one part and compress\r\nanother part of the lungs. Blood flow diminishes in some parts of the\r\nlungs and increases in others. Fluid leaks from the blood into the\r\ntissues and into the air sacs in parts of the lungs. These effects cause\r\ndifficulty in breathing, low arterial oxygen saturation, and impaired\r\nconsciousness during high sustained acceleration and, to a lesser\r\nextent, after its cessation. They must be considered when selecting the\r\nbest gas to be breathed, since a high partial pressure of oxygen is\r\nfavorable for consciousness, but a low inert-gas concentration during\r\nacceleration is unfavorable for rapid lung recovery afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nA study of the manned space flights and laboratory observations to date\r\nsuggests that during long periods of weightlessness, some physiological\r\ndifficulties may arise which may produce serious effects on human\r\nperformance. Although recent experience gives no grounds for expecting\r\ninsuperable difficulties, neither the quantity nor quality of the\r\navailable observations permits the conclusion that long-term exposure to\r\nweightlessness will _not_ have serious consequences. The critical role\r\nto be played by the astronaut demands that every effort be made to\r\nidentify in advance those phenomena which may affect performance, and to\r\nstudy their qualitative and quantitative relationships so that proper\r\nprecautions can be taken.\r\n\r\nLawton ([ref.197]), in reviewing the literature on prolonged\r\nweightlessness, found few instances in which physiological function was\r\ntruly gravity dependent. He stated that the physiological systems likely\r\nto be most affected by weightlessness were the musculoskeletal system,\r\nthe cardiovascular system, and the equilibrium senses. Subsequent\r\nexperience proved this to be the case. McCally and Lawton ([ref.198])\r\nanalyzed the data from experiments since 1961 and concluded that much\r\nmore basic laboratory work is necessary. Studies using immobilization,\r\nimmersion, and cabin-confinement techniques were recommended approaches\r\ntoward simulating weightlessness.\r\n\r\nMuch of the difficulty in obtaining precise information of anticipated\r\nproblems arises from a lack of knowledge of normal mammalian physiology.\r\nMany of these deficiencies can be remedied in the laboratory. In\r\nspace-flight development, however, two distinct investigational\r\napproaches can be adopted. The first of these may be characterized as\r\nempirical and incremental; that is, the capabilities of the astronaut\r\nare explored in successive flights involving relatively modest increases\r\nin difficulty or severity of the environmental conditions. In this way\r\nit is hoped to ascertain the human limitations without running too great\r\na risk. The second approach can be described as fundamental: determining\r\nby a series of controlled experiments the effects of exposure to\r\nspace-flight conditions upon comparative mammalian physiology, with\r\nemphasis on man. A fundamental understanding of the observed effects\r\nwould be sought so that predictions for new situations and possible ways\r\nto control them could be made with confidence.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible now to predict for flights of 30 days or more—\r\n\r\n  (1) The effects of sudden reimposition of reentry accelerations and\r\n      terrestrial gravity\r\n  (2) Changes in body fluid distribution and composition\r\n  (3) The effects of violent physical effort on respiratory and\r\n      cardiovascular systems in prolonged weightlessness\r\n  (4) Central nervous system functions, especially coordination, skilled\r\n      motor performance, judgment, and sleep-wakefulness cycles\r\n\r\nNASA has emphasized that planning for manned space programs involves a\r\nsystematic extension from physiological observations in animals to man,\r\nand finally the establishment of man as part of the man-vehicle system\r\ndesign. Moreover, these studies require the evaluation of central\r\nnervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other\r\nsystems as a matrix in mutual interdependence. There is particular\r\ninterest in the effects of weightlessness on flights exceeding 30 days.\r\n\r\nMammalian flights of about 30 days also merit attention, including the\r\ndevelopment of the life-support systems which must precede such a\r\nprogram. Development of facilities for biological experiments may well\r\nbe an important requirement for studies in anticipation of manned\r\nflights of longer duration than Apollo. Unless the biological satellite\r\nprograms of the type mentioned above are successful in providing the\r\nnecessary data, a manned orbiting laboratory may also be important in\r\nstudies of shorter range.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Studies of Biological Rhythmicity\r\n\r\nThe effects of weightlessness on the organism as a whole may be\r\nmanifested by important changes in certain integrated behavioral\r\npatterns having an inherently rhythmic character. Modifications in basic\r\nbehavioral patterns and performance may occur as disruptions of rhythmic\r\nphysiological phenomena, which are themselves the end product of\r\ninterrelated functional activity in a number of physiological systems,\r\nsuch as the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of interdependent components of biological rhythmicity are\r\nbeginning to be analyzed by methods well established in\r\nphysics—including correlation and spectral analyses, and phase\r\nmodulation and variance in rhythmic processes. A wide variety of\r\nphysiological functions can be treated as periodic variables in the\r\nanalysis, including rhythmicities in cardiac output and blood pressure,\r\nrespiration, brain waves, and the slower tides of appetite, and\r\nsleep-wakefulness. The importance of such investigations argues for\r\ntheir inclusion in forthcoming flight programs. Their experimental\r\nsimplicity is an additional advantage. Biorhythms have been discussed in\r\nmore detail in the section on \"Environmental Biology.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Weightlessness on the Cardiovascular System\r\n\r\nEarlobe oximetry, indirect measurements of blood flow and of blood\r\npressure by finger plethysmography or impedance plethysmography, and\r\nballistocardiographic techniques have potential application to manned\r\nspace flight.\r\n\r\nAdaptation to prolonged exposure to weightlessness or to lunar gravity\r\nmay cause difficulties when the astronaut is exposed again to reentry\r\nforces and terrestrial gravity. It is possible that these adaptive\r\nchanges may thus produce unacceptable effects on performance or cause\r\nrisk to life. It is important to obtain experimental evidence on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that following a stay in bed, dizziness,\r\nfaintness, and weakness characterize arising, and that a feeling of\r\ngeneral weakness may persist for several days. The phenomenon has been\r\ninvestigated in a number of laboratories. One approach has been to put\r\nhealthy young subjects to bed, and even in extensive casts for periods\r\nof 2 or 3 weeks or more. Two major findings have emerged from these\r\nstudies. First, a substantial adjustment in the blood circulatory system\r\noccurs, which is termed the \"hypodynamic state.\" Second, there is a\r\nlarge decrease in the skeletal and muscle mass of the body.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of evidence for the hypodynamic state: measurement\r\nof parameters of circulatory function, and measurement of the response\r\nof the individuals to a quantitatively imposed mild gravitational load.\r\nAfter 3 weeks in bed, otherwise healthy persons exhibit an increase of\r\nmore than 20 percent in heart rate; a reduction of 10 to 20 percent in\r\ntotal blood volume, primarily as a result of reduction of plasma volume;\r\nand a decrease in heart size of about 8 percent. Coupled with these\r\ncardiovascular changes is a reduction of 10 percent in the basal\r\nmetabolic rate. It appears as though the circulation and metabolism are\r\nreset to a lower functional level commensurate with the reduced demands\r\nplaced on the whole organism.\r\n\r\nAfter 3 weeks of bed rest, all of the subjects tested showed pronounced\r\northostatic hypotension. After tilting, the average heart rate increased\r\nby 37 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure fell some 12-mm Hg,\r\nand some of the subjects fainted. The measurements were continued for 16\r\ndays after the bed-rest period, and it was round that recovery was not\r\nquite complete when the experiment was terminated.\r\n\r\nThere is little question that in prolonged exposures to the weightless\r\nstate, there is a fair probability of extensive circulatory adjustments,\r\nthe seriousness of which cannot yet be foretold. While it is likely that\r\nthe astronauts will adapt successfully to long periods of weightlessness\r\nat some new circulatory functional level, the remote possibility exists\r\nthat the circulatory changes may be progressive to the point of ultimate\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetabolic Effects of Weightlessness\r\n\r\nWithout metabolic information, accurate planning of environmental\r\nsystems for long flights is difficult. Importance is also attached to\r\nearly evaluation of weightlessness effects on body-fluid equilibria. The\r\nresults of Earth orbital flights and of terrestrial water-immersion\r\nexperiments suggest the occurrence of undesirable changes, although no\r\neffects leading to operational incapacity have yet arisen.\r\n\r\nIn both recumbency and immersion, a similar redistribution of body\r\nfluids occurs. It has been suggested that recumbency may affect an\r\nextracellular fluid-volume receptor mechanism which by decreasing\r\naldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, would decrease sodium\r\nreabsorption by the renal tubules. Aldosterone excretion decreases\r\nduring recumbency and during standing in water, but increases while\r\nstanding in air. There is also evidence for cardiac atrial volume\r\nreceptor mechanisms which respond to increased filling of the left\r\natrium with reflex inhibition of release of pituitary antidiuretic\r\nhormone (ADH), resulting in diuresis (Henry-Gauer reflex).\r\n\r\nAltered fluid equilibrium in buoyant states is accompanied by shifts in\r\nintracellular and extracellular electrolyte distribution, especially\r\nsodium and potassium. Evidence from recumbency studies indicates a\r\nstrong correlation between loss of erect posture or weight bearing and\r\nexcretion of calcium stores in bone.\r\n\r\nA bone X-ray densitometry method has been developed by Mack, at Texas\r\nWoman’s University, for accurately determining the loss of bone mineral\r\n(±2 percent accuracy) in humans and animals. The heel bone and spine are\r\nX-rayed using a calibrated aluminum wedge as a standard. This technique\r\nwill be used for preflight and postflight analysis of the primate being\r\nflown in the 30-day biosatellite. Comparative appraisal of bone mineral\r\nbehavior in astronauts participating in the Gemini and Apollo programs\r\nwill be invaluable for future flight missions.\r\n\r\nBed rest and immobilization studies by Mack have shown loss of skeletal\r\nmineral and increased calcium in the urine and excreta. Four bed-rest\r\nstudies, each extending for 2 weeks, compared different levels of\r\ncalcium intake. Four men were used in each study and served as their own\r\ncontrols during extended ambulatory periods. During 2-week periods, up\r\nto 10 percent of calcium mineral was lost from the heel bone. Calcium\r\nwas also determined in the urine and feces. In other studies, isometric\r\nexercises reduced loss of bone mineral during bed rest.\r\n\r\nExcretion of calcium in the urine is accompanied by risk of its\r\ndeposition as calculi or \"kidney stones\" in the urinary tract.\r\nCurrently, changes in calcium metabolism resulting from weightlessness\r\nover periods up to 2 weeks is not considered a hazard requiring\r\nprecautionary measures.\r\n\r\nFlights in excess of 2 weeks, however, constitute a problem serious\r\nenough to warrant study on the 11-day orbital flights and the 30-day\r\nbiosatellite primate mission. Therapeutic immobilization,\r\npost-poliomyelitis immobility, and experimental restraint in normal\r\nsubjects lead to a negative calcium balance, with hypercalciuria.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Nervous System Functions in Weightlessness\r\n\r\nThe wide range of individual tolerances to the disturbing effects of\r\nvestibular stimulation has emphasized the importance of this factor in\r\nastronaut selection. At the same time, vestibular functions must be\r\nconsidered jointly with visual task performance, since both have special\r\nsignificance for such maneuvers as vehicle docking. Vestibular function\r\nin the weightless state remains almost completely unknown. Limited\r\nevidence from animal and manned space flights suggests that head\r\nturning, resulting from vestibular stimulation, may seriously interfere\r\nwith visuomotor performance, but that susceptibility to these\r\ndisturbances is significantly different between individuals and that\r\npartial adaptation occurs relatively quickly.\r\n\r\nNASA is currently collecting extensive baseline electroencephalogram\r\ndata under controlled conditions in a form suitable for mathematical\r\nanalysis. Data are being taken from about 200 subjects in major national\r\nand overseas centers. It is intended that this study will assist in\r\nastronaut selection and monitoring in space.\r\n\r\nStudies on many effects of weightlessness on nervous functions require\r\nmonitoring of the autonomic nervous system, including such autonomic\r\neffects as gastrointestinal activity, secretion, lacrimation,\r\nsalivation, sweating, and the central control of respiration. Urinary\r\nestimations of catecholamines and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid would\r\nprovide important data on autonomic system activity if collected in\r\nflight and compared with preflight and postflight controls.\r\n\r\nMajor areas have been outlined in which prolonged weightlessness may be\r\nexpected to interfere with performance, judgment, and, ultimately,\r\nchances of survival. These include cardiovascular, metabolic, central\r\nnervous, psychophysiological, and biorhythmic effects. They have been\r\ndealt with separately and in sequence, but have not been intended to be\r\nviewed as hierarchic. The relative scarcity of data necessarily\r\nprecludes such an evaluation.\r\n\r\nSoviet experience with zero gravity and weightlessness has increased\r\ntheir emphasis on this space-flight factor and was an important topic at\r\nthe May 1964 COSPAR meeting. Discussion of the postflight medical status\r\nof Bykovsky (5-day flight) and Tereshkova (3-day flight) revealed a\r\nconcern for the significance of prolonged weightlessness and the\r\npresence of postflight physical debility and fatigue following Vostok\r\nflights 3 through 6. These changes persisted for several days. Among the\r\nphysiological conditions singled out for mention were—\r\n\r\n  (1) _Body fluids_— Cosmonauts have shown a postflight weight loss of\r\n      1.9 to 2.4 kg apparently resulting from a redistribution of body\r\n      fluid in response to elimination of the hydrostatic pressure\r\n      gradients caused by Earth gravity. There is the suggestion that\r\n      this redistribution is complete within the first 24 hours of\r\n      flight. Titov is reported to have been dehydrated alter his flight\r\n      with early hemoconcentration. These findings directly support\r\n      predictions made from ground-based research.\r\n  (2) _Cardiovascular_— Postflight orthostatic tachycardia is reported\r\n      for Titov as long as 23 hours after landing; at 48 hours there was\r\n      significant residual intolerance to the upright posture.\r\n      Cosmonauts have demonstrated a 20- to 35-percent increase in\r\n      oxygen consumption during the standard postflight exercise test.\r\n\r\nIn both of these areas there was a return to normal within the\r\npostflight period of study. The Soviets have continued their biological\r\nexperiments in space with the Vostok/Voshkod series. Fixing of\r\nhistologic specimens in flight by Bykovsky demonstrated a critical role\r\nfor man and made possible an expanded experimental program. Biopackages\r\nhave become more complex with each succeeding flight.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of postflight orthostatic intolerance after the third\r\nand fourth Mercury flights, changes as a result of exposure to a\r\nzero-gravity environment have not been noted by U.S. investigations in\r\nspace. Ground-based research proceeds here at an advanced pace and is\r\nsupported in large measure by both the USAF and NASA. A study of the\r\nrelationships among renal and systemic hemodynamics, neurohumoral\r\ncardiovascular regulation, and renal excretory function in differently\r\npositioned subjects is underway, as are studies of acceleration\r\ntolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DEPRESSED METABOLISM\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of prolonged manned space flights, NASA has sponsored\r\nresearch related to metabolism depression. The daily food requirements,\r\nfor example, of astronauts during a voyage of several months can\r\nconstitute a major portion of the weight and storage capacity of the\r\nspacecraft. A somewhat promising and fundamental approach to this\r\nproblem is the reduction of the astronauts’ daily metabolic\r\nrequirements. It has been suggested that astronauts on prolonged space\r\nmissions be put in a state of suspended animation until their\r\ndestination is reached. Though this sounds fantastic, 10 years ago no\r\ncell had been frozen to cryogenic temperatures and survived. Today it is\r\ncommonplace for tissues to be frozen, stored at low temperatures, and\r\nthawed and then to maintain their viability and function.\r\n\r\nAnimal metabolism may be depressed by reducing body temperature, as in\r\nhibernation and hypothermia. Other means by which metabolism can be\r\nlowered include drugs and electronarcosis. Hibernation is a nonstressful\r\nstate and results in a great decrease in metabolism. However, human\r\nbeings are not hibernators, and much research is needed before the\r\nmechanism of hibernation is understood, and the possibility of inducing\r\nit in humans evaluated. Hypothermia is the direct cooling of the body to\r\ntemperatures where metabolism is substantially depressed. Extracorporeal\r\ncirculation systems combined with cooling are in routine use in most\r\nmedical centers throughout the world. Hypothermia is not an ideal\r\nsolution, however, since general body hypothermia is a stressful\r\ncondition. Pharmacologic induction of hypothermia can be accomplished by\r\nsuch drugs as chlorpromazine and harbamil. Other drugs can be used to\r\ndepress metabolism, but all have some disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been a growing interest in electronarcosis,\r\nthe induction of sleep by an electric current. Although potentially\r\nvaluable, this method is far from routine application.\r\n\r\nOutstanding advances have been made in metabolism suppression. Recent\r\nprogress in the biochemistry and physiology of hibernation and\r\nhypothermia have shown that the oxygen requirements of individual\r\nmammals, organs, and tissues can be reduced. When the chemical\r\ncomposition of the blood and the cardiac output are sufficient to meet\r\ncellular requirements, regulatory mechanisms remain effective and animal\r\nsurvival is assured. In contrast, when oxygen transport is interrupted,\r\na reduction in cellular activity occurs and regulation is impaired. In\r\ninduced hypothermia, the low temperature slows the rates of all\r\nprocesses and modifies the action of metabolites and other substances.\r\nThis in itself is not harmful, as shown by the true hibernating animal\r\n(e.g., ground squirrel), but will become disastrous as soon as anoxia\r\nand chemical imbalance begin to develop.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of natural hibernation is being investigated in the\r\nlaboratory in the hope that the unusual tolerance of hibernating animals\r\nto reduced metabolism and low body temperature may some day be produced\r\nartificially in ordinary laboratory animals and man. Experiments with\r\nthe ground squirrel, a typical hibernator, show that the artificially\r\ncooled ground squirrel does not tolerate such long periods of low body\r\ntemperature as does a naturally hibernating animal.\r\n\r\nOther studies of the brown adipose tissue (fat), which is present in\r\nmost hibernating mammals, show it to be essential to hibernation.\r\nIndications that brown fat has a thermogenic role in rats exposed to low\r\ntemperatures suggest that this may be the case in true hibernators\r\n([ref.199]). Arousal of the hibernating animal by cold is triggered by\r\nsympathetically activated thermogenesis in areas of brown fat so\r\nlocated, relative to the vasculature, that the heat is transferred to\r\nareas of the body concerned with normal metabolic and nervous activity.\r\n\r\nSoviet work comparing various depressed metabolic states and resistances\r\nto acceleration shows deep winter hibernation to be most effective,\r\nfollowed by deep hypothermia, and drug narcosis as the least effective.\r\n\r\nExperimental evidence is being accumulated to show that hibernation and\r\nhypothermia somewhat protect animals against radiation. Clinical studies\r\non irradiation of cancer patients indicate that lowering the body\r\ntemperature reduces cellular metabolism and thus decreases tissue\r\nsensitivity to gamma radiation ([ref.200]).\r\n\r\nThe use of prolonged hypothermia, hibernation, drugs, and\r\nelectronarcosis appears to hold some potential for reducing astronauts’\r\nmetabolic requirements. If one or mote of these methods become\r\npractical, human requirements for food and oxygen could be drastically\r\nreduced. Simultaneously, these methods may afford radiation protection\r\nand acceleration tolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NUTRITION IN SPACE¹⁰\r\n\r\n  ¹⁰ Includes part of [ref.201]. See also [ref.202].\r\n\r\nThe human body can use food stores so that the nutritional requirements\r\ncan be reduced for a short time. This will vary widely among individuals\r\nand each individual may exhibit characteristic patterns of nutritional\r\nbehavior. During reduced food intake, muscular efficiency may not change\r\nsignificantly over a period of 4 to 6 days; unfortunately, however,\r\nmental activity begins to decline after 24 hours. Feeding requirements\r\ncan be divided into two categories: short term (for missions of less\r\nthan 21 days) and long term. Since dehydration can occur in a matter of\r\nhours under adverse conditions, water requirements must be considered as\r\na special case.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Requirements\r\n\r\nWater requirements are extremely critical and the amount supplied should\r\nnot under any circumstances be kept to a minimum. Rather, a large margin\r\nof safety should be allowed.\r\n\r\nPresent data on water requirements show a very strong dependence upon\r\nsuit inlet temperatures. In the absence of an accurately controlled suit\r\ntemperature, water requirements can easily double. If this should occur,\r\nthe mission would probably have to be aborted, since it is doubtful if\r\nelectrolyte balance would be maintained at such high rates of water\r\nloss. Normal or even extreme conditions of the terrestrial environment\r\nusually include diurnal variation in temperature which may modify water\r\nneeds. These conditions will not be obtained in the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nIn addition to ground-based experiments, measurements of water intake\r\nshould be made under actual flight conditions. Data from short-term\r\nflights should be used for extrapolation to longer missions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormula Diets\r\n\r\nThe tacit assumption which now prevails, \"Astronauts even on short-term\r\nmissions require a diet of great variety,\" is apparently not well\r\nsupported. In many parts of the world, people live on a monotonous diet\r\nconsisting of only a few types of food with no apparent ill effects,\r\nprovided their nutritional requirements are satisfied. Experimental\r\nevidence from many sources (e.g., the Army Medical Research and\r\nNutrition Laboratory) shows that individuals can be kept on a single\r\ndisagreeable formula diet for as long as 60 to 90 days without harm.\r\nSince highly motivated individuals are chosen for space flights, it is\r\nunlikely that they would object to the monotony of a formula diet and\r\nwould probably prefer its simplicity. Also, there are definite\r\npossibilities of developing a much more acceptable formula than present\r\ntypes. There is no reason to anticipate adverse effects from the use of\r\nformula diets in short-term flights.\r\n\r\nFormula diets would be extremely desirable for short-term flights. A\r\nformula diet (a rehydrated liquid formula could be used) would\r\nconsiderably reduce the number of manipulations and the time required\r\nfor in-flight preparation, compared to a varied diet. These two\r\nimprovements could contribute materially to the safety of a flight,\r\nsince the astronauts would not be preoccupied with food preparation for\r\nso long a period, and the food could be dispensed without removing suit\r\ncomponents, such as gloves. Storage requirements could be simplified\r\nwith this type of diet. Weight, however, would not be lowered without\r\nthe development of more refined formulas than those now available.\r\nFormula diets could readily be adapted to the determined metabolic\r\nrequirements of the individual astronaut. Packaging problems will be\r\nsimplified by using formula diets, which can easily be given a variety\r\nof flavors and colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaste\r\n\r\nThe problem of waste production is intimately related to nutrition and\r\ncan be solved or simplified by dietary changes. Any diet should be\r\nadjusted for the minimum production of feces, before and during even\r\nshort flights. Water will be sequestered by accumulation in the feces,\r\nand the net loss, under normal conditions, would be approximately 40 to\r\n60 grams per man per day. Flatus can be a serious problem, since\r\nconsiderable concentrations of toxic gases may accumulate. The\r\npurification system for the recirculated atmosphere must be able to\r\nremove these, although the diet should be planned to minimize the\r\nproblem. The collection of urine and its storage is of importance,\r\nparticularly on short-term flights, and individual packaging and\r\nlabeling of urine specimens will be necessary for the analyses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetabolism\r\n\r\nAn accurately measured intake of nutrients, calories, and water is\r\nnecessary for determining metabolic demands imposed in any space flight.\r\nThere is insufficient knowledge to predict total metabolic requirements\r\nunder the numerous stresses which can be anticipated. Simulator studies\r\nare of great importance even for short-duration flights.\r\n\r\nThe two most important variables to be considered in establishing the\r\nminimal diet are protein and energy requirements. NASA is supporting\r\nresearch at the University of California (Berkeley) to determine these\r\nrequirements and to estimate individual variation in healthy young men.\r\nThe possibility of minimizing need through biological adaptation is\r\nbeing explored.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the minimum protein requirement of an adult\r\nman. The generally accepted criterion of minimum adequate protein\r\nnutrition in the adult is the maintenance of nitrogen balance at minimum\r\nintake. The minimum protein requirements depend on endogenous nitrogen\r\nloss. Analysis of the little data available indicates a best estimate of\r\n2 mg of nitrogen per kilocalorie of basal energy expenditure. However,\r\nthis figure is higher than that noted in experiments in some human\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nAfter minimum nitrogen requirements and minimum amino acid requirements\r\nhave been established, studies will be directed toward investigating\r\ncaloric restriction and adaptation to restriction of calories. It has\r\nbeen suggested that caloric restriction in animals and man results in\r\napparent decreased energy need for the same activity. This apparent\r\nparadox has never been explained. It has been shown that there is\r\nadaptation to repeated episodes of caloric restriction both in animals\r\nand man, so that subsequent periods of caloric restriction result in\r\ndecreased rate of weight loss, nitrogen loss, and longer survival.\r\n\r\nAdditional experiments are urgently required to determine the metabolic\r\ndemands for minerals—in particular, the metabolic balance of calcium,\r\npotassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Under conditions of high water\r\nconsumption, large mineral losses are to be expected. Failure to replace\r\nthese can cause an imbalance which could impair the efficiency of the\r\nindividual to the extent of endangering the flight.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of samples taken in flight, both of urine and feces, should be\r\nmade. Respiratory quotients can be determined in flight, blood samples\r\nshould be taken before and immediately after flight for analyzing\r\nselected components (in simulator studies these could be taken\r\nperiodically), and nutritional intakes (which would be facilitated by\r\nformula diets) must be measured and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort-Range Technology\r\n\r\nThere are many practical difficulties in providing for food storage and\r\naccessibility in spacecraft. The packaging of food materials, both\r\ndehydrated and liquid, has proceeded satisfactorily under the\r\nsupervision of the Food and Container Institute. If packaging materials\r\nare to be made to withstand very high relative humidities and large\r\nvariations in temperature, additional investigations are required, since\r\nsuch containers are not yet available. In packaging, serious\r\nconsideration must be given to the ease with which the food may be\r\nreached and eaten.\r\n\r\nIf dehydrated formula foods are to be fed on short-term missions,\r\nadditional work is required on the rehydration of such formulas. Present\r\nmethods of water measurement under weightless conditions are not\r\nsatisfactory, and better methods will have to be contrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-Term Nutritional Problems\r\n\r\nThere is a dearth of metabolic information, even for short-duration\r\nflights, without which changes in metabolic patterns to longer flights\r\ncannot be extrapolated. However, using scattered information, certain\r\nchanges which may be encountered can be hypothesized. Decalcification of\r\nbone and changes in water-holding capacity of the body may be\r\nanticipated. It is also possible that changes in proportion of fat to\r\nlean body mass could be experienced and should be considered in\r\nnutritional planning. Nutritional requirements depend on size,\r\nparticularly lean body mass, sex, physiological state, and individual\r\nmetabolic rates. Therefore, individuals for space flight should be\r\nscreened with these factors in mind if it is desirable to minimize food\r\nintake in long flights. The factors which influence the total\r\nnutritional requirements of the individual also influence his mental and\r\nphysical responses to stress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynthetic Foods\r\n\r\nThe development of food materials other than those derived directly from\r\nanimal or vegetable origin is of interest. Advantages of such diets may\r\nbe low residue, ease of storage, rehydration, and manipulation.\r\nExperiments with chemically defined synthetic diet for humans have been\r\ncarried out by Medical Sciences Research Foundation, San Mateo, Calif.\r\nThe complete liquid diet is composed of required amino acids, fat,\r\ncarbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals. A cubic foot of the diet (50\r\npercent solids in H₂O) supplies 2500 calories per day for 1 month, and\r\nhas been given a variety of artificial flavors.\r\n\r\nThis synthetic diet has been fed to human volunteers for 6 months in a\r\npilot study at the California Medical Facility, Vacaville, Calif., and\r\nthe results are being reviewed. Schwarz Bioresearch, Inc., is studying\r\nthe storage, stability, and packaging of chemically defined synthetic\r\ndiets for human and animal flights.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood Production in Space\r\n\r\nLong-term feeding in space depends upon a payload of stored food unless\r\nfood is produced during flight. If sufficient propulsive energy is\r\navailable, the duration of missions using stored food may be quite long.\r\nHowever, in emergencies in which a mission lasts longer than planned,\r\nsurvival may depend on the ability to produce food extraterrestrially.\r\nEventually it will be desirable or necessary to produce food beyond the\r\nconfines of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe nutritional requirements of the crew will be influenced by such\r\nfactors as activity, physical and psychological stress, individual size\r\nof the members, and individual metabolic rates. The food intake will\r\nhave to be adjusted to meet these requirements. It is necessary to know\r\nthe nutritional requirements of each astronaut and the way in which\r\nthese are altered by the conditions of space flight in order to estimate\r\nneeds on long missions. Without this information, the food supplies for\r\nthe longer flights may be too much, too little, or improperly balanced.\r\nWhere dependence would not be on stored food alone, but on food produced\r\nen route, more exact information on requirements is needed to determine\r\nthe capacity of food production units.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of bioregenerative systems, it was suggested that food\r\nmaterials could be produced by photosynthetic organisms (e.g., algae,\r\nduckweed, and other higher plants) or by nonphotosynthetic organisms\r\n(e.g., _Hydrogenomonas_). In contrast to the use of living organisms,\r\nreprocessing waste materials by chemical treatment or the actual\r\nsynthesis of high-energy compounds has been suggested. No chemical\r\nsystem has yet been demonstrated as workable for the economical\r\nproduction of food in space, and the systems considered produce\r\nmaterials which may be converted to food, but are not food as such.\r\n\r\nAlgal cultures have had the most extensive investigation as food in\r\nspace, but the technical problems of using this material as a food\r\nsource have not yet been solved. It is apparent from the investigations\r\nto date that algae will require treatment before they can be used as\r\nfood. In limited trials, difficulties have been experienced with amino\r\nacid deficiencies, digestibility, high residues, and gastric distress.\r\nProcessing methods which would be applicable in space travel and the\r\npossibility of secondary conversion by other animals or plants should be\r\nsystematically investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               chapter 8\r\n\r\n_Significance of the Achievements_\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SIGNIFICANCE TO SCIENCE\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical research areas of the space program is\r\nbioscience. Of both practical and philosophical significance in\r\nexploring the origins of life and the possibilities of life on other\r\nplanets, bioscience also promises much in medical aspects. Space offers\r\nbiologists completely new environmental factors, such as the effects of\r\nzero gravity and of removal from Earth’s rotation. These effects have\r\nbeen studied in attempts to advance understanding of basic mechanisms of\r\nphysiology and biological rhythms. These studies can be of great value\r\nin dealing with problems of disease and metabolic disorders.\r\n\r\nBiological research is fundamental to the problem of successfully\r\nprotecting and sustaining man in the peculiar and hostile space\r\nenvironment. Understanding human requirements and variations in their\r\nresponse to various environmental factors offers value in medical\r\nresearch for human survival and comfort. The many technological\r\ndiscoveries and advancements in electronic and engineering equipment\r\ngreatly enhance medical diagnosis, treatment of disease, and the\r\nextension of human life.\r\n\r\nThe life sciences, biology and medicine, are fundamental to the success\r\nof manned exploration of space, which marks a unique and significant\r\ndevelopment in the long history of man’s conquest of new frontiers.\r\nThose who pioneered other frontiers on land and sea and in the air were\r\nnot forced to await biological and medical research. Even the pioneers\r\nof aerial flight began their efforts without first seeking biomedical\r\ndata. The search for such data followed flight experience and, indeed,\r\nwas made only after problems arose.\r\n\r\nProject Mercury, NASA’s first program for manned space flight,\r\nstimulated immediate and extensive studies in the life sciences to\r\nsustain man in space. Before a vehicle could be designed to carry an\r\nastronaut into space, anticipated biomedical problems associated with\r\nspace flight were studied. Life-support systems were designed to offer\r\nadequate protection from environmental stresses peculiar to space, such\r\nas zero gravity, removal from Earth’s rotation, and high-energy cosmic\r\nradiation. These life-support systems used knowledge already gained from\r\nresearch for manned space flight by the U.S. Air Force.\r\n\r\nOur entry into space has put us at the threshold of fundamental and\r\nfar-reaching discoveries in the biological realm which have profound\r\nimplications for other areas of human thought and endeavor. As man goes\r\nfarther into space, the hazards increase; but past accomplishments\r\nindicate that the road ahead holds more promise than peril and that the\r\nvistas of knowledge that may be foreseen are as vast as space itself.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything which now can be said about the effects of\r\nextraterrestrial environments and about life on the Moon or the planets\r\nlies in the realm of pure speculation. There is one prediction, however,\r\nthat can be made with considerable certainty by reason of historical\r\nprecedent—the opportunity to investigate a totally new area, such as is\r\noffered by space exploration, is certain to produce a burst of\r\nscientific interest as soon as the path is charted by a few pioneers.\r\nOver the next few decades a progressively larger proportion of\r\nbiological interest will turn to space. We may well expect that the\r\ndiscoveries made here will revolutionize some of our concepts of\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nIt should be fully realized that the accumulation and dissemination of\r\nbiological and other scientific information is not only of great value\r\nto science and humanity but is of tremendous import to the prestige of\r\nthe Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SIGNIFICANCE FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nIt can be predicted as confidently for space biology as for other space\r\nsciences that the economic costs will be amply repaid in the long run by\r\napplications of space-oriented biotechnology to other fields of biology\r\nand medicine. There are inevitable substantial, though indirect,\r\ncontributions of NASA’s continuing efforts in space biology.\r\n\r\nNASA-supported biological research has many practical applications and\r\n\"spinoffs\" which contribute to the fields of health and medicine, food\r\nand agriculture, and industry and manufacturing. Some of these are\r\npresented to show the range and value of applications which have\r\nresulted from basic and applied biological research. In addition to\r\nthose listed are many others from the biosatellite program, particularly\r\nin the fields of bioengineering and miniaturization.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth and Medicine\r\n\r\nSolar cells, which have powered space systems, are now being used as a\r\npower source in studies on brain function. A miniaturized solar cell\r\ndeveloped by General Electric provides enough power, under ordinary\r\nhouse lights, to stimulate an animal’s brain and to telemeter\r\nrespiratory, cardiovascular, and brain-wave data while the animal is\r\nallowed to move about freely. Such a system is now used by the National\r\nInstitute of Mental Health Laboratory at Rethesda, Md.\r\n\r\nScientists at the Ames Research Center have devised a new technique for\r\nstudying organic compounds, whether synthesized in the laboratory or\r\nproduced by a living system. This technique is based on a property of\r\nmatter called optical activity. Previous methods of measuring optical\r\nactivity have been plagued by low sensitivity. The new method is many\r\ntunes more sensitive and represents a real contribution to modern\r\nanalytical instrumentation.\r\n\r\nStudies on calcium metabolism and bed rest simulating weightlessness are\r\nadding knowledge on the prevention of demineralization of the skeleton;\r\ntreatment of Paget’s disease and osteoporosis prevention of muscular\r\natrophy; the cause and treatment of renal calculi (kidney stones);\r\noptimal calcium for the human diet; and the factors influencing calcium\r\nabsorption, metabolism, and excretion. The results will have great\r\nimportance in bone healing and repair, care and treatment of fracture\r\ncases, treatment of paraplegics, and treatment of polio patients and\r\nsimilar cases. These grant studies at Texas Woman’s University have also\r\nproven that the X-ray bone densitometry method can accurately detect\r\nchanges in the skeleton.\r\n\r\nA primary objective of the planetary exploration program is the\r\ndetection of possible extraterrestrial life. The study of the\r\nfundamental properties of living things on Earth is restricted to the\r\ntype of life which has evolved and survived here. Life which has been\r\nexposed to totally different environmental conditions may have markedly\r\ndifferent physiological characteristics. The impact of the new\r\ninformation obtainable from the study of extraterrestrial life upon the\r\nsciences of medicine and biology will unquestionably be of fundamental\r\nand far-reaching importance. Advancement in the treatment of disease and\r\nthe problems of aging are among the many possible consequences.\r\n\r\nNew developments in such techniques as ultraviolet spectrophotometry,\r\npolarimetry, and gas chromatography will find use in the detection of\r\nbiochemicals and other compounds in hospitals and in toxicology and\r\npathology laboratories. They will also be useful in studies of\r\natmospheric pollutants such as smog.\r\n\r\nStudies of the chemistry of living systems, molecular biology, and\r\nbiophysics of cellular processes will create a better understanding of\r\nthe basic mechanisms of life, leading to an understanding of both\r\ninherited and acquired disease, especially neoplastic conditions and\r\nchemical disturbances incident to mental disease.\r\n\r\nThe University of Pittsburgh is conducting a study to increase the\r\navailability of cytological technique in research and as a monitoring\r\nprocedure by developing an automatic electronic scanning device using\r\ncomputer analysis for recording, counting, and sorting chromosomes.\r\nStructural changes in blood cell chromosomes can indicate the degree of\r\nradiation damage as well as damage resulting from various environmental\r\nstresses. Accordingly, this instrument, when developed, can be used as a\r\nradiation dosimeter in civil defense by swiftly detecting the degree and\r\ntype of chromosomal aberrations in blood cells. Thus, casualties in\r\nnuclear attack could be quickly detected and treated. This system would\r\nalso be useful for nuclear industrial plants and for military maneuvers.\r\nIn medicine, various disease trends could be monitored. (Chromosomes\r\nexhibit anomalies in leukemia and mental retardation as well as in other\r\nstates.) In space exploration and experimentation, the device can spot\r\nmonitor radiation dose levels as well as changes resulting from any of\r\nthe environmental stresses experienced in space. This apparatus can be\r\nmodified for use as an extraterrestrial-life-detecting instrument by\r\nscanning the growth of cells (or cellular inclusions), computing rates,\r\nand telemetering changes to the researcher.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of rhythmic phenomena of various physiological systems\r\ncan result in knowledge of the utmost importance to medicine. Rhythmic\r\nphenomena are found in the cardiovascular system of normal humans.\r\nChanges in these rhythms have the potential of foretelling abnormalities\r\n(heart disease, arteriosclerosis) before outward signs are manifested,\r\nallowing for earlier diagnosis, treatment, and control or cure.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft sterilization program requires the use of rooms having\r\nthe lowest attainable level of bacterial contamination. The rate of\r\ndissemination of bacteria from the humans in the room is basic to the\r\nproblem. Data on this matter are being obtained through support of the\r\nCommunicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service. The\r\nfindings are affecting the measures used in surgical practice to lower\r\ninfection rates.\r\n\r\nStudies on the physiology of hibernation in mammals are important to\r\nunderstand temperature regulation and the mechanism of survival at low\r\nbody temperatures. The purpose of this type of research is to understand\r\nand use reduced metabolic activity in astronauts on future extended\r\nspace flight. Other applications involve studies of the mechanisms of\r\ninjury and freezing biological organisms, for improving techniques in\r\nhypothermic surgery, pathology, and preservation of tissue for human\r\ngrafting.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood and Agriculture\r\n\r\nGathering agricultural information by remote sensing of Earth’s surface\r\nfrom aircraft, balloons, and satellites has a potential application in\r\nresearch and development. Current needs for data gathered in this way\r\ninclude crop and livestock surveys for marketing planning; soil mapping;\r\ncrop disease, insect, and weed surveys; soil conservation management and\r\nresearch; and crop acreage control programs. As population and world\r\ntrade increase, the needs will become even more intense for regularly\r\nscheduled synoptic surveys of the world’s agricultural lands for crop\r\nplantings and harvests; determining the condition of crops as affected\r\nby drought, disease, or insect outbreaks; and studies of the lands\r\nsuitable for agricultural development in underdeveloped countries. The\r\nonly way that worldwide synoptic surveys can be made is by using\r\norbiting platforms.\r\n\r\nThe NASA nutrition program for developing diets for prolonged manned and\r\nanimal space flight lends itself to civil defense purposes; military\r\nmaneuvers where space and weight are prime considerations; polar and\r\ndesert exploration; reducing hunger in underdeveloped countries; and\r\ndetecting metabolic diseases as well as diseases of infancy and old age.\r\nFor space research such a diet can be used on prolonged manned space\r\nflights, animal experiments in space, manned orbiting laboratories, and\r\nspace and planetary stations. Studies on the packaging and stability of\r\nfoods under various conditions of humidity, temperature, and radiation\r\nwill lead to better processing and storage.\r\n\r\nLearning how microbial spores are transported by air is important to\r\nbiology, agriculture, and medicine. Besides spreading crop destruction,\r\nmicrobial spores produce allergic responses in some human beings. To\r\nobtain the facts, not only the biology of micro-organisms but also the\r\nweather factors that induce the flight of mature spores must be known.\r\nThus, both biological and meteorological problems are involved. Data\r\nobtained under a NASA contract with the General Mills Electronic\r\nDivision (now part of Litton Industries, Inc.) indicate that spores of\r\nfungi are present in low numbers in the stratosphere. A reservoir of\r\nspores exists which cannot be brought down by the normal scrubbing\r\nmechanisms of rainfall and other meteorological disturbances in the\r\ntroposphere. This finding has important implications for reducing the\r\nspread of agricultural crop diseases and for protecting persons\r\nsuffering from allergies. This project has indicated the necessity for\r\ndesigning novel biological samplers for use in the stratosphere. Such\r\nsamplers will aid in determining various pollutants of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe NASA program for developing sterile spacecraft for the biological\r\nexploration of Mars will contribute improved methods of sterilization\r\nthat can be applied to the canning industry. Studies on sterilization at\r\nlow temperatures for long periods of time are being supported by NASA at\r\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Communicable Disease\r\nCenter and the Sanitary Engineering Center of the Public Health Service.\r\nThe developing capability is making possible the heat sterilization of\r\nproducts that never before could be thoroughly sterilized.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for missions to search for extraterrestrial life, research\r\non the psychrophilic or cold bacteria, on halophytic or salt bacteria,\r\nand on specialized bacteria and other organisms growing in extreme\r\nenvironments is defining the extremes under which life can exist.\r\nIncreased knowledge about organisms that can grow in or on refrigerated,\r\ndried, or salted foods and other materials should have practical\r\napplications for food storage and preservation. Research on\r\npsychrophilic bacteria is being conducted by Whirlpool Corp. and the\r\nNASA Ames Research Center.\r\n\r\nTheoretical studies of Martian life involve investigations of plant and\r\nbacterial spores. Many of these forms are spoilage organisms and some\r\nproduce lethal toxins. This work has potential importance for food\r\nprocessing and for obtaining more precise knowledge of how wounds become\r\ninfected. The program for investigating possible forms of life on Mars\r\nincludes a thorough study of anaerobic micro-organisms. This research\r\nhas led to the discovery of new types of nitrogen-fixing bacteria other\r\nthan the familiar types found in the root nodules of leguminous plants.\r\nThus, it may be possible to use these microorganisms, or the principles\r\ninvolved, in the incorporation of vital atmospheric nitrogen into\r\nterrestrial soils which are now unproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry and Manufacturing\r\n\r\nBatteries that have been developed in the space program to endure high\r\nsterilization temperatures for extended times will have greatly\r\nincreased shelf life at normal storage temperatures and will be\r\nserviceable after many hours of baking at high temperatures.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the highest quality tape recorders are subject to imperfect\r\nreproduction because the tapes are heat labile; i.e., they soften and\r\nstretch when warm. The development of high-quality magnetic tapes for\r\nspace-data recorders is an outgrowth of the materials developed to meet\r\nspacecraft sterilization requirements. These improved tapes will be\r\nuseful for all types of recording—industry, automation controls, home,\r\nand studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 OUTLOOK FOR BIOSCIENCE—MAJOR PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nThe problems undertaken are among the most challenging, if not _the_\r\nmost challenging, man faces on the space frontier. These include the\r\nquest for the origin of life, the explanation of life and life\r\nprocesses, the elucidation of the environment’s role in establishing and\r\nmaintaining normal organization in living organisms, the possibility of\r\nextraterrestrial life on other planets—the concern of exobiology. The\r\ngreatest promise for their solution lies in advances in biological\r\ntheory rather than other avenues of research; therefore, it is fortunate\r\nthat the need to solve them has come at a time when developments in\r\nexperimental biology are at a high level. In addition, technological\r\ndevelopments in electronics and engineering are providing new and\r\nwonderful instruments for this great exploration into the sources of\r\nlife. Many of these have had practical application that has made\r\npossible important advances in medical diagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\nThe broad national space goals initially charted by NASA have gone\r\nbeyond space flight in near-Earth orbit to lunar and interplanetary\r\nexploration by man and machine. For such missions, more intensive and\r\ncomprehensive research in the life sciences is needed. Before manned\r\nvoyages for extended periods into deep space will be possible, solutions\r\nmust be found for problems such as the development of bioregenerative\r\nlife-support systems, communication with nonhuman species, and the\r\ndevelopment of new methods for transferring knowledge to the human\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThe problems are all of the type that could perhaps be solved by truly\r\ngreat advances in biological theory, and probably not by any other\r\navenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            _References_\r\n\r\n\r\n   [ref.1] _Rea, D.
