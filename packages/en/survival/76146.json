Though nearly seven years have elapsed since the publication\r\nof the second volume it may fairly be said that the delay is not\r\nentirely due to causes which it was in my power to control. The subject\r\nof geographical distribution receives no connected treatment in Volumes\r\nIII and IV for the simple reason that I underestimated the space\r\nrequired for the description of the Gymnosperms. The alternatives were\r\neither to insert a greatly compressed survey of the successive floras\r\nof the world at the end of Volume IV or to attempt a fuller and less\r\ntechnical treatment of the subject in a separate book. In choosing the\r\nlatter course I am conscious that a further obligation is undertaken\r\nwhich it may not be possible to fulfil; but the risk is deliberately\r\ntaken. Volume IV is in the press and will, it is hoped, be published\r\nbefore the end of 1917.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant duty to repeat my thanks to many friends who have\r\nhelped me in various ways. Dr Kidston generously and without reserve\r\nallowed me access to his splendid collection of Palaeozoic plants,\r\nand the frequent occurrence of his name in the list of illustrations\r\nshows how freely I have availed myself of his kindness. He has read\r\nsome of the chapters and greatly assisted me by his friendly criticism\r\nand encouragement. By reading the proofs of this volume Dr Scott has\r\nfurther increased my already large debt to him. It is impossible to\r\nthank him adequately; he not only corrected many careless mistakes but\r\nby wise counsel and advice he rendered me a service which I greatly\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of views with Prof. Zeiller has been a constant source of\r\nprofit and enjoyment, and it is hard to realise that the completed book\r\nwill not receive his kindly criticism. He was a singularly unselfish\r\nand generous colleague, always ready to help fellow workers, and he\r\nhad the faculty in an unusual degree of influencing those who had the\r\nprivilege of his friendship by his sound advice and lovable personality.\r\n\r\nThe death of Count Solms-Laubach has deprived Palaeobotany of one of\r\nits most learned and strongest supporters. In common with all students\r\nof fossil plants I owe much to the critical treatment of the subject\r\nin the _Einleitung in die Paläophytologie_. Prof. Jeffrey has very\r\nkindly given me several photographs and sections which have been of\r\ngreat service, and I am similarly indebted to Prof. Zalessky. To Prof.\r\nNathorst my thanks are due for the great interest he has taken in my\r\nwork and for his generosity in providing drawings and showing to me\r\nmany of the treasures in the famous Stockholm Museum. Prof. Bertrand\r\nand Prof. Lignier freely supplied photographs and drawings of specimens\r\nin their possession, and I am particularly grateful to them for the\r\nwillingness with which they always responded to my requests.\r\n\r\nThrough the death of Prof. Lignier in March 1916 Palaeobotany has\r\nbeen deprived of another original thinker who devoted himself with\r\nwhole-hearted enthusiasm to botanical research and for many years\r\nfaithfully served the University of Caen: he was a generous friend to\r\nwhom one never appealed in vain for assistance. Through the kindness\r\nof the Director of the Indian Geological Survey I have been able to\r\nexamine several fossils from the Calcutta Museum described by Oldham\r\nand Morris and by Feistmantel. With the Director’s permission several\r\nphotographs and drawings made for a forthcoming paper to be published\r\nby the Indian Survey are reproduced in this volume. I take this\r\nopportunity of thanking friends in Australia who recently afforded me\r\nfacilities for examining fossil plants in their charge, and I would\r\nespecially thank Mr A. B. Walkom of the University of Brisbane, who\r\nhas recently undertaken an investigation of the rich plant-beds in the\r\nIpswich district, for all that he did to enable me to make the most of\r\na very short time available for palaeobotanical work.\r\n\r\nFor the loan of specimens and for other help I am indebted to Prof.\r\nBayly Balfour, Prof. Bower, Prof. Margaret Benson, Prof. Oliver, Sir\r\nDavid Prain, Dr Smith Woodward, Prof. Weiss, the Director of the\r\nGeological Survey, Dr A. H. Church, Dr Arber, and other friends. I\r\nwould also acknowledge a debt, by no means inconsiderable, to my\r\nColleague Mr Hamshaw Thomas. Among younger friends in the Cambridge\r\nBotany School to whom I am indebted I wish particularly to thank Miss\r\nRuth Holden, Miss Bancroft, Mr Sayers, Mr Dutt and others who have\r\nrendered me willing help.\r\n\r\nIn the List of Illustrations mention is made of Corporate Bodies and\r\nindividuals from whom blocks have been obtained, and I am grateful to\r\nthem for readily responding to my applications.\r\n\r\nMy Wife, though prevented by more urgent calls in the later stages of\r\nmy task from giving as much time to the illustrations as in the two\r\nformer volumes, has contributed several drawings, and my daughter\r\nPhyllis Seward has also given me much help in preparing drawings from\r\npreviously published figures.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the vigilance and wise counsel of many friends numerous\r\nblemishes remain and for these the author is alone responsible.\r\n\r\n                                                       A.

In the case of _Taeniopteris_, one of the genera already\r\ndescribed, there is reason to believe that at least one species is a\r\nmember of the Cycadales and not a true Fern as formerly supposed.\r\n\r\nThe Pteridosperms so far described are represented for the most part\r\nby sterile leaves preserved as impressions, the genera founded on\r\nmore satisfactory material having been reserved for treatment in this\r\nvolume. As these genera are founded to a large extent on anatomical\r\ncharacters oscillating in their essential features between recent Ferns\r\nand Cycads, it is important that the student should be in possession of\r\nthe anatomical characteristics of both of these classes; and for this\r\nreason a general account of recent Cycads is intercalated between the\r\nPteridosperms already described and those reserved for treatment in\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe section of the Gymnosperms known as the Cycadales, represented\r\nby nine recent genera and less than 100 species, is of exceptional\r\nimportance phylogenetically and demands special attention from\r\npalaeobotanical students. Familiarity with the morphology of recent\r\nforms is essential not only in relation to extinct cycadean plants\r\nbut also to types which, though not sufficiently close to surviving\r\nspecies to be included with them in one class, exhibit features\r\nregarded by many botanists as indications of an affinity either to true\r\nCycads or to some generalised stock of which they are an offshoot.\r\nThe Cycads of to-day may fairly be spoken of as anachronisms, plants\r\nappropriate to a former age but out of harmony with the present. They\r\nare confined to tropical and sub-tropical regions in both the old\r\nand new world. In habit many of them resemble tree-ferns, but the\r\ncolumnar stem, which may live to a great age and attain a height of\r\n20 metres, differs from that of ferns in its gradually tapered form\r\nconsequent on the presence of one or more cambial cylinders. Though\r\noften unbranched (fig. 377) branching of the main trunk is by no means\r\nunusual (fig. 378; fig. 381, B). Many Cycads are geophilous and\r\nhave short tuberous stems (figs. 383, 395, 1_a_; 396, E): the genus\r\n_Zamia_ includes a few epiphytic forms[1]. The typical cycadean stem\r\nis covered with persistent petiole-bases with or without an admixture\r\nof smaller scale-leaf bases (figs. 379, 380), while in several species\r\na transversely wrinkled or irregularly fissured periderm forms the\r\nsuperficial tissue (figs. 381, B; 383). The foliage-leaves are\r\nrelatively large and, with the exception of the bipinnate fronds of\r\n_Bowenia_ (fig. 391), they are always pinnate. The fronds usually form\r\na terminal crown (figs. 377, 379) and as many as 100 may be produced\r\nfrom one bud. In _Zamia pygmaea_[2] the fronds are only 10–12 cm. long,\r\nbut in some cycads they reach a length of several metres. On both\r\nyoung foliage-leaves and scale-leaves long and very rarely branched[3]\r\nunicellular hairs (fig. 396, N) form a characteristic feature and take\r\nthe place of the ramental scales of the majority of ferns. The apex of\r\nthe stem shown in fig. 386, A is covered with a mass of woolly hairs\r\nand several scale-leaves are seen on the lower part of the bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377. _Cycas circinalis._ From a photograph taken\r\nby Mr A. Malins Smith at Teldeniya (Ceylon).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378. _Cycas revoluta_, as grown by Japanese\r\nhorticulturalists. (After Wieland.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379. _Encephalartos horridus._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380. _Cycas circinalis._ Stem showing alternate\r\nzones of leaf-bases (F) and scale-leaf bases (S). (From the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381. A. _Cycas revoluta_, megasporophylls. B.\r\n_Zamia Loddigesii_, branched stem.]\r\n\r\nAll recent Cycads are dioecious. The reproductive shoots, except the\r\nmegasporophylls of _Cycas_—which have departed to a less extent than\r\nthose of other genera from the foliage-leaf plan (fig. 381, A; fig.\r\n392, A–C) and are borne in a terminal cluster through which the stem\r\nsubsequently pushes its way—consist of a varying number of micro-\r\nor mega-sporophylls in dense spirals on the axis of an elongated or\r\noval strobilus (figs. 386, B, 393, 394). The microsporophylls are\r\noccasionally verticillate[4]. The strobili are sometimes though rarely\r\nbranched[5] and generally but by no means invariably[6] terminal on\r\nthe main stem which branches sympodially[7]. A striking example of\r\nlateral strobili has recently been described by Chamberlain[8] who\r\nfigures a stem of _Macrozamia Moorei_ with fertile shoots wedged among\r\nthe persistent petiole-bases, a condition very similar to that in\r\nthe Mesozoic Bennettitales. Pearson has also described clear cases\r\nof laterally-borne cones in _Encephalartos._ _Cycas_ exhibits two\r\nkinds of branching, the female plants being monopodial while in the\r\nmale the branching is sympodial. The microspores are produced in\r\nsporangia grouped in more or less well defined sori (figs. 389, A; 392,\r\nE–G). There is no definite annulus, but in the occurrence of groups\r\nof thick-walled cells some microsporangia recall those of certain\r\nferns[9]. The ovules vary considerably in size, sometimes exceeding\r\n5 cm. in diameter: there are usually two on each megasporophyll\r\n(figs. 393, C; 394; 395, 1_d_) but in most species of _Cycas_ (fig.\r\n392, B) and occasionally in other genera the number is larger[10]. A\r\nthick integument encloses the nucellus with which it is fused except\r\nin the apical region (fig. 396, A, B). Below the comparatively long\r\nmicropylar tube is a well-developed pollen-chamber (fig. 396, B′, _p_),\r\na striking feature of Cycadean ovules, immediately above the megaspore;\r\nthe latter is filled with prothallus-tissue and bears a small apical\r\ngroup of archegonia on the floor of a depression (fig. 396, A–B′).\r\nIn _Microcycas_[11] as many as 200 archegonia are recorded—a very\r\nexceptional case—and these are not confined to the apical region,\r\nthough only the apical archegonia are functional. Each archegonium\r\nis characterised by a very large oval egg-cell and a much reduced\r\nneck[12]. The microspores usually produce a single prothallus-cell, a\r\nstalk-cell, and body-cell, and from the body-cell are developed two\r\nspirally ciliated spermatozoids (fig. 396, M). In this respect also\r\nthe monotypic genus _Microcycas_ is peculiar: it may have as many as\r\n8 body-cells and 16 male gametes in a single pollen-tube (fig. 396,\r\nG), while in _Ceratozamia_[13] 4 gametes have been seen in one tube.\r\nThe pollen-tube grows like a fungal mycelium into the nucellar tissue\r\nand the male gametes are formed in the distended proximal end which\r\non bursting liberates the motile sperms with the watery cell-sap.\r\nFertilisation is succeeded by the development of a homogeneous\r\nproembryo partially or completely filling the zygote (fertilised\r\negg): by the formation of long suspensors the embryo is brought into\r\ncontact with the food-store of the prothallus. In some Cycads, _e.g._\r\n_Encephalartos_, the embryogeny exhibits a close resemblance to that of\r\n_Ginkgo_[14]. The embryo is dicotyledonous[15].\r\n\r\nThe single stele of the stem is characterised by a large pith which\r\nin some genera (_e.g._ _Encephalartos_, _Macrozamia_) contains an\r\nanastomosing system of collateral bundles. The vascular tissue of a\r\ncycadean stem forms a cylinder of secondary xylem and phloem, the\r\nprimary xylem being represented only by a few, usually crushed,\r\nprotoxylem elements on the inner margin of the reticulately pitted\r\nor scalariform tracheids. Both xylem and phloem are traversed by\r\nnumerous broad and deep medullary rays[16]. The looser texture and\r\nmore parenchymatous structure of Cycadean wood afford a ready means\r\nof distinguishing it from the wood of Conifers: for the Cycadean\r\ntype the term _manoxylic_ is proposed and _pycnoxylic_ for the more\r\ncompact coniferous wood[17]. Rims (or ‘bars’) of Sanio, of which\r\nmuch has been said in discussions on the phylogeny of Conifers, have\r\nrecently been described in the petiolar xylem of _Cycas revoluta_:\r\nthe rims are short and ‘cling closely to the borders of the pits,’\r\nfeatures which also characterise the rims found in the cones of the\r\nAraucarineae and in the root- and cone-wood of certain Pines[18]. In\r\nsome Cycads the secondary xylem and phloem form a single cylinder,\r\nbut in others (_Cycas_, _Encephalartos_, _Macrozamia_, _Bowenia_) the\r\ncambium is succeeded by one or several concentric cylinders of meristem\r\nwhich have their origin in the pericycle. The spasmodic occurrence\r\nof separate arcs of inversely orientated secondary xylem and phloem\r\nbetween the normal cylinders is a feature of importance from the\r\npoint of view of comparison with the Palaeozoic Medulloseae[19]. The\r\noccurrence of concentric cauline strands in the cortex of _Cycas_ is\r\nalso a peculiarity worthy of notice. Successive bands of periderm, and\r\noccasionally a considerable amount of phelloderm[20], are formed in the\r\nperipheral region of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-traces in an adult stem exhibit a striking feature in their\r\nindirect or girdle-like course to the leaves (fig. 396, H, _g_) and\r\nin the gradual change from an endarch (fig. 396, O) to an apparently\r\nmesarch structure (fig. 400) as they pass from the perimedullary zone\r\nto the petiole: except at the base of the petiole the vascular bundles\r\nof the frond-axis consist of (i) centripetally developed xylem with a\r\nmedian protoxylem and a much smaller amount of centrifugal xylem (fig.\r\n400) separated by a few parenchymatous elements from the centripetal\r\nxylem, (ii) an external arc of protophloem and within this metaphloem\r\nand parenchyma[21]. In the slender petiole of _Bowenia_ there are a few\r\ncollateral bundles arranged in the form of a circle or ellipse[22];\r\nin _Cycas_ and some other genera the more numerous bundles form a\r\npattern like an inverted U, and in some species of _Encephalartos_ the\r\nnumber is greater and the strands more irregularly scattered[23]. In\r\nthe vegetative stems there is no centripetal xylem in the stele, but\r\nscattered centripetal tracheids occasionally occur internal to the\r\nprotoxylem in the steles of the peduncles[24].\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Cycadeae.= Megasporophylls each bearing 2–8 ovules, borne separately\r\nlike foliage-leaves and not in strobili. Pinnae have a midrib but no\r\nlateral veins (figs. 384, 387, A). _Cycas_ (fig. 377).\r\n\r\n=Zamieae.= Both kinds of sporophylls form strobili. Pinnae have\r\nseveral dichotomously branched, more or less parallel veins. _Zamia_\r\n(figs. 388–390), _Macrozamia_, _Encephalartos_ (figs. 379, 386, C),\r\n_Ceratozamia_, _Dioon_ (fig. 386, B), _Microcycas_.\r\n\r\n=Stangerieae.= Strobili as in Zamieae. Pinnae fern-like, numerous\r\ndichotomously branched lateral veins given off from a midrib.\r\n_Stangeria._\r\n\r\n=Bowenieae.= Leaves bipinnate (fig. 391), strobili as in Zamieae.\r\n_Bowenia._\r\n\r\n_Distribution._ The most widely spread genus, _Cycas_, occurs in Siam,\r\nIndia, the Nicobar Islands, Ceylon, Madagascar, and Australia, in\r\nmany of the islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans, in New Guinea,\r\nBorneo, New Caledonia, New Britain, China and Japan[25]. _Zamia_, the\r\nmost northerly genus, extends from North Mexico and Florida through\r\nCentral America and some of the West Indian islands to Ecuador,\r\nBolivia, Chile, and Peru. _Dioon_ and _Ceratozamia_ are confined to\r\nSouth Mexico, and _Microcycas_ flourishes on the Cuban mountains. The\r\ncontinent of Africa possesses two endemic genera _Encephalartos_ and\r\n_Stangeria._ _Encephalartos_ extends from Cape Colony through Natal and\r\nZululand to Zanzibar and Mombasa[26]: a specimen in the Kew Herbarium\r\n(probably _E. Hildebrandti_) is said to have been collected as far\r\nnorth as the Soudan. Two species are recorded from the Congo[27] and\r\n_E. Barteri_, discovered by Barter in Central Africa, is recorded from\r\nthe Gold Coast[28]. _Stangeria_ has a much more limited range in S.E.\r\nAfrica[29]; Australia possesses _Macrozamia_, represented by several\r\nspecies in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, _Cycas_\r\nin Queensland and the Northern territory and the Queensland genus\r\n_Bowenia_. There are no Cycads in New Zealand. As a whole Cycads have\r\na limited range and with the exception of _Cycas_ and _Zamia_ none of\r\nthem extend beyond the limits of a single continent. They are as a rule\r\nnot gregarious plants and play a subordinate part in the facies of the\r\nvegetation. _Macrozamia_ forms dense thickets[30] in some districts\r\nand occurs both in exposed situations and in association with Palms\r\nin damp Queensland forests. Chamberlain[31] speaks of 100 plants\r\nof _Dioon edule_ as visible in one view in South Mexico where the\r\nspecies forms a mountain forest. In Florida _Zamia pumila_[32] grows\r\nin dense moist woods, a habitat in contrast to that of many Cycads.\r\nThe Mexican _Ceratozamia_ is associated with luxuriant vegetation,\r\nwhile its compatriot _Dioon_[33] lives in blazing sunshine. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker[34] speaks of _Cycas_ living in the deepest and hottest\r\nvalleys in Sikkim. _Encephalartos_ is essentially a xerophilous genus.\r\n_Stangeria paradoxa_ is said to be confined to forests in Cape Colony,\r\nand another species grows among the grass of the Park-lands in open\r\ncountry[35]. While it is true that many Cycads are characteristic of\r\ndry regions some species flourish in places where shade and moisture\r\nare abundant.\r\n\r\nThough it is impossible in many cases to form an estimate of the age\r\nof individual plants, there are clear indications that some specimens\r\nafford notable instances of longevity. Chamberlain estimates the age of\r\nsome plants of _Dioon spinulosum_ as exceeding 400 years and mentions\r\nan example of _D. edule_ that is probably 1000 years old. An unusually\r\ntall plant of _Encephalartos_ in the Botanic Garden of Amsterdam\r\nis believed by Prof. de Vries to have reached the venerable age of\r\n2000 years[36]. The restricted range and in many cases the solitary\r\nexistence of recent Cycads, with their tall stems clothed with the\r\npersistent cork-covered stumps of thousands of fronds, deepens the\r\nimpression of antiquity derived from a study of the geological history\r\nof this dwindling race.\r\n\r\n_Stems._ The tall columnar stems of some species of _Cycas_, often\r\nbranched or bearing numerous ovoid buds like enlarged bulbils[37],\r\nare characterised by the regular alternation of large and small\r\nleaf-bases as seen in the stem of _C. circinalis_ reproduced in fig.\r\n380. In older stems of this species the leaf-bases are exfoliated and\r\nthe stem is covered with wrinkled and fissured cork; but in _Cycas\r\nrevoluta_ the leaf-bases are even more persistent. The columnar but\r\nrelatively stout stems of _Encephalartos_ (figs. 379, 382, 386, A) and\r\n_Ceratozamia_ are similarly encased in a covering of petiole-bases, but\r\nin these genera the differences between foliage-leaves and bud-scales\r\nis much less obvious and there is no zonal alternation. On the stems\r\nof _Macrozamia_ the rhomboidal leaf-bases are more uniform in size\r\nand there are no scale-leaves. The tall and often palm-like stems of\r\n_Microcycas_ sometimes show transverse rings on the bark marking\r\nthe position of former terminal buds, and in older trunks these may\r\ndisappear, leaving a fissured bark[38]. In _Cycas siamensis_ the\r\ntuberous stem is similarly covered with a rough bark (fig. 383) and the\r\nstems of _Zamia_ are also characterised by an absence of persistent\r\nleaf-bases (figs. 381, B; 395, I_a_, _a_). It is pertinent to remind\r\nthe palaeobotanical student of the occurrence of flowering plants\r\nwith stems closely simulating those of some Cycads. Prof. Bower[39] in\r\ndescribing _Rhynchopetalum montanum_, an Abyssinian Lobeliaceous plant,\r\ndrew attention to the similarity in surface-features and to some extent\r\nin anatomical structure to cycadean stems. The resemblances are further\r\nemphasised in a more recently published account of the same species\r\nunder a different name, _Lobelia Rhynchopetalum_[40].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382. _Encephalartos Ghellinckii._ (¹⁄₁₁ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383. _Cycas siamensis._ (From the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_.)]\r\n\r\n_Fronds._ A general acquaintance with the various types of fronds\r\nillustrated by recent Cycads is important to the student of fossils\r\nnot only to enable him to compare existing and extinct forms but\r\nas affording safeguards against possible sources of error in the\r\ndescription and identification of impressions[41]. The vernation\r\nexhibits less uniformity than in Ferns: in _Cycas_ the rachis is\r\nstraight and the pinnae circinately coiled (fig. 220, B, vol. +ii.+\r\np. 283); in _Zamia_ and _Stangeria_ the rachis is bent and the pinnae\r\nstraight, while in _Ceratozamia_ and other genera both the axis and\r\nleaflets are straight. As Braun pointed out, there is as a rule no\r\nterminal leaflet, or it may be pushed to one side giving a forked\r\nappearance to the frond apex[42].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384. _Cycas circinalis_, abnormal frond. (From a\r\nspecimen in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n_Cycas._ The presence of a strong midrib and the absence of lateral\r\nveins are distinguishing features: the lower margin of the lamina is\r\nfrequently decurrent (fig. 387, A). In _C. circinalis_ the pinnae\r\nmay reach 40 cm. in length with a fairly uniform breadth of 2 cm. A\r\nfrond of this species in the British Museum, not quite complete, has\r\na length of 112 cm.: on the lower part of the rachis strong spines\r\nreplace the leaflets and near the apex of the leaf concrescent pinnae\r\nform a continuous lamina traversed by seven ribs and dissected at the\r\nmargin into acuminate teeth (fig. 384): some of the pinnae are forked\r\nas in _Cycas Micholitzii_[43] (fig. 385). Several years ago I noticed\r\na similar instance of concrescence in a small plant of _C. circinalis_\r\nin the Royal Gardens, Kew (fig. 387, I). In _Cycas Micholitzii_\r\nthe pinnae, reaching a length of 20 cm., are repeatedly and deeply\r\nforked (fig. 385, A, B; fig. 400): the pinnae of _C. Rumphii_ var.\r\n_bifida_[44] are also deeply dissected. _Cycas Beddomei_ has very\r\nnarrow pinnae (15 cm. × 2 mm.) similar to those of the Wealden species\r\n_Cycadites Saportae_, and it is noteworthy that narrow leaflets with\r\na strongly revolute lamina would produce casts with two parallel ribs\r\n(the grooves between the midrib and the edge of the lamina) simulating\r\nthe double midrib of the fossil genus _Pseudocycas_. In some fronds,\r\n_e.g._ _C. Cairnsiana_, the midrib is hardly visible on the upper\r\nface of a dried pinna which shows a longitudinal wrinkling simulating\r\nparallel venation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385.

C, _Zamia angustifolia._]\r\n\r\n_Encephalartos._ The fronds of this genus, in _Encephalartos\r\nLaurentianus_[45] reaching the exceptional length of 7 metres, bear\r\nalternate pinnae exhibiting a considerable range in form and breadth.\r\nIn _E. longifolius_, _E. Altensteinii_ (fig. 386, C), _E. Lehmanni_,\r\netc., the pinnae are for the most part linear, reaching a length of\r\n20 cm. and a breadth of 2 cm.: in _E. caffer_ (fig. 387, D), _E.\r\nlatifolius_, and others the pinnae are broader and shorter and often\r\nspinous. A frond of _E. longifolius_ or _E. Altensteinii_ may bear both\r\nentire and lobed, spinous pinnae. In _E. Frederici-Guilielmi_ (fig.\r\n387, G) and _E. Ghellinckii_[46] (fig. 382) the pinnae are very narrow\r\nand almost filiform, with revolute edges. The thick and leathery pinnae\r\nof some species are attached obliquely to the edge or to the upper\r\nsloping sides of the rachis which forms a prominent ridge between the\r\nrows of leaflets, and characteristic oval scars are left on the fall\r\nof the pinnae (fig. 387, D, G′). The lamina in most species contains\r\nseveral veins more or less parallel to the margins and often much more\r\nprominent on the lower than on the upper surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.\r\n  A. _Encephalartos Altensteinii_, apex of stem.\r\n  B. _Dioon edule_,megastrobilus.

Wallisii_[47] (fig. 388) with broad ovate segments reaching a\r\nlength of nearly ·5 metre and attached to the rachis by a short stalk;\r\nthe veins are prominent and dichotomously branched. Other forms of\r\npinnae are represented by _Z. integrifolia_, _Z. floridana_, and _Z.\r\nLoddigesii_ (figs. 389, 390, 395). The broad and short pinnae of\r\n_Z. furfuracea_[48] bear a close resemblance, except in the absence\r\nof an auriculate base, to those of some species of the fossil genus\r\n_Otozamites_. The broadly linear pinnae of _Z. pseudoparasitica_ (45\r\ncm. × 3 cm.) often show longitudinal wrinklings on drying which suggest\r\ncomparison with the corrugated lamina of the fossil species _Nilssonia\r\nbrevis_. A basal pad or callosity on the slender bases of the pinnae is\r\ncharacteristic of many _Zamia_ fronds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388. Pinna of _Zamia Wallisii_. From a drawing\r\nafter A. Braun in the Kew Herbarium. (⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389. _Zamia integrifolia_ bearing a megastrobilus\r\nand showing foliage-leaves and scale-leaves. A, microsporophyll; B,\r\nmegasporophyll. (After Rendle, from Jacquin.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390. Small frond of _Zamia Loddigesii_. (⅔ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n_Ceratozamia._ The fronds bear a fairly close resemblance to those\r\nof _Macrozamia_: in _Ceratozamia mexicana_ the linear pinnae reach a\r\nlength of over 30 cm. and a breadth of 2–3 cm.; the lamina tapers to a\r\nnarrow apex and is more abruptly contracted at the base (fig. 387, H).\r\nThe veins in _Ceratozamia_ are sub-parallel and dichotomy occurs up to\r\nthe middle of the lamina[49]. A striking feature is the occurrence of\r\ntwo opposite stipule-like projections a short distance above the base\r\nof the petiole.\r\n\r\n_Macrozamia._ A noteworthy feature in some species is the attachment of\r\nthe linear pinnae along the middle line of the rachis (fig. 387, C); in\r\nothers (fig. 387, B) the leaflets are attached laterally and may have\r\na basal callosity. The parallel veins, which branch dichotomously near\r\nthe base of the lamina, are often much more prominent on the lower than\r\non the upper face. In _M. heteromera_[50] (fig. 396, F, F′) the narrow\r\npinnae are deeply forked and strongly revolute. The spirally twisted\r\nrachis of _M. spiralis_, _M. heteromera_, etc., is a striking feature\r\nrecalling the Rhaetic fern _Camptopteris spiralis_ Nath[51].\r\n\r\n_Dioon._ The arrangement of the linear pinnae of _D. edule_ (fig. 386,\r\nB), _D. spinulosum_, and _D. Purpusii_[52] forms a ready means of\r\ndistinguishing the fronds of this genus: the pinnae, often contiguous\r\nand at right-angles to the rachis, are attached in a lateral groove\r\nby an expanded and slightly decurrent base. The difference between\r\nthe lower and upper face of a frond (fig. 387, E, F) affords a good\r\nillustration of a common source of error in the identification of\r\nfossil specimens. The leaflets of _D. spinulosum_, which except in\r\ntheir spinous margin are very similar to those of _D. edule_, may\r\nreach a length of 15 cm. and a breadth of 8 mm. The parallel veins are\r\nunbranched[53].\r\n\r\n_Microcycas[54]._ The pinnae of this genus, very like those of the\r\nWealden species _Zamites Buchianus_, reach a length of 20 cm. and a\r\nbreadth of 8 mm.: on falling they leave oblong scars resembling those\r\non the rachis of _Encephalartos_.\r\n\r\n_Stangeria._ This genus is particularly interesting because of its\r\nfern-like habit and venation. The large fronds of _S. paradoxa_[55]\r\nbear broadly linear acuminate pinnae with entire, unevenly lobed,\r\nserrate, or pinnatifid margins. Some leaflets are so deeply dissected\r\nas almost to justify the appellation pinnate. Both entire and dissected\r\nleaflets may occur on one frond and the lower ones may be stalked while\r\nthe upper pinnae are sessile. The venation agrees closely with that of\r\nthe genus _Taeniopteris_[56].\r\n\r\n_Bowenia._ The large fronds of this genus (fig. 391) are peculiar in\r\nbeing bipinnate; they may reach a length of 2 metres and have a long\r\nslender petiole: the asymmetrical lamina of the segments, entire or\r\ndeeply serrate, is attached by a very short stalk; the veins branch\r\ndichotomously[57] and diverge slightly. Both entire and serrate pinnae\r\nmay occur on the same plant, but Chamberlain has revived André’s\r\nspecific term _serrulata_ in preference to the generally adopted\r\ndesignation for the serrate forms, _B. spectabilis_ var. _serrata_[58].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391. _Bowenia spectabilis_, frond. (From the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_.)]\r\n\r\n_Reproductive shoots_[59]. In _Cycas circinalis_, _C. Rumphii_, and\r\nother species the megasporophylls reach a considerable length and bear\r\nseveral lateral ovules each of which may be as large as a goose’s\r\negg: the sterile distal end has the form of a spear-point with an\r\nirregularly serrate edge. In _C. revoluta_, _C. pectinata_, etc., the\r\nsterile part is deeply dissected and may break off (fig. 392, A) from\r\nthe fertile portion of the sporophyll. The megasporophylls of _C.\r\nRiuminiana_ exhibit a striking variation in form (fig. 392, B, C);\r\nsome are 15 cm. long with several ovules, while others, reduced to 8\r\ncm., bear only two ovules and resemble the sporophylls of _Dioon_.\r\nIn all other genera the megasporophylls are aggregated into cones,\r\nbut in _Dioon_ the strobili are characterised by their more ovoid\r\nform and by the looser arrangement of the sporophylls (fig. 386, B),\r\neach of which consists of a horizontal stalk expanded distally into\r\na broadly lanceolate upturned end covered with a thick felt of hairs\r\nand bearing at its base usually 2, rarely 5–6, ovules on cushion-like\r\nswellings. In _Dioon spinulosum_ the cones may be 50 cm. long. Between\r\nthe cones of _Microcycas_, over 90 cm. long, and those of some Zamias,\r\na few centimetres long, there are many intermediate forms. The large\r\nstrobilus of an _Encephalartos_ reproduced in fig. 393, D, shows the\r\nconvex ends of the sporophylls with a jagged edge, and in monstrous\r\ncones the marginal lobes may be abnormally developed and assume the\r\nappearance of pinnae[60]. Each megasporophyll bears two large ovules\r\n(fig. 393, B). In certain species of _Encephalartos_ the swollen ends\r\nof the sporophylls have a truncate centre like the flattened umbo of\r\nsome Pines (fig. 392, D). The presence of two divergent spines is a\r\npeculiarity of the megasporophylls of _Ceratozamia_ (fig. 393, C):\r\nin _Macrozamia_ (fig. 394) the distal ends are prolonged as tapered\r\nprocesses. The surface of the strobilus of _Stangeria_ is formed by\r\nimbricate and rounded ends of sporophylls (fig. 392, H) not unlike the\r\ncone-scales of _Pinus excelsa_ or _P. cembra_. The megasporophylls of\r\n_Zamia_ are expanded into regular cushion-like hexagons with a flat\r\ncentral area (figs. 389, B; 395, I_b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.\r\n\r\n  A. _Cycas pectinata_, apex of megasporophyll.

After\r\nWieland.)]\r\n\r\nThe microsporophylls (figs. 389, A; 392, E) are in all genera\r\naggregated into strobili which often bear a close resemblance to\r\nseed-cones (fig. 393, A). On a single sporophyll of _Cycas circinalis_\r\nthere may be as many as 700 sporangia while in _Zamia floridana_ there\r\nare only two microsporangia. The spore-output is large and in extreme\r\ncases, _e.g._ in _Dioon spinulosum_, the average number of spores in a\r\nsporangium is said to be 30,000[61].\r\n\r\n_Seeds._ In the great majority of recent species the seeds may be\r\ndescribed as large and afford a striking contrast to the small seeds\r\nof the Mesozoic Bennettitales. A feature of interest from the point\r\nof view of comparison with Palaeozoic seeds is the absence of a\r\nresting stage, germination in some cases following seed-fall without\r\nan interval. As Warming pointed out, the embryo is often undeveloped\r\nwhen the seeds are shed. An interesting fact is recorded by Capt.\r\nDorrien-Smith[62] with regard to seed-dispersal: he describes the\r\nheavy pebble-like seeds of a _Macrozamia_ as being hurled from the\r\nripe cones a distance of 12 ft. The seeds of _Cycas_ are platyspermic;\r\nthe woody shell exposed on removal of the outer flesh is slightly\r\nflattened and has two prominent angles, but three-angled seeds may\r\noccur as in _Ginkgo biloba_ (fig. 631, C). In other genera the seeds\r\nare radiospermic. The seed of _Encephalartos Altensteinii_[63] (fig.\r\n396, D) has a square-cut distal end with a small papilla at the\r\nsummit of the unusually long micropylar canal (17 mm.). The stone of\r\nthis seed (fig. 396, C) shows parallel curved ridges which mark the\r\nposition of vascular strands in the inner region of the outer flesh.\r\nThe large ovules of _Cycas circinalis_[64] have an integument 1 cm.\r\nthick consisting of an outer and inner flesh and an intervening stony\r\nlayer which reaches its greatest development at the base and apex.\r\nThree vascular strands enter the base of the seed, the concentric\r\nstrand breaks up in the broad inner flesh into a group of bundles which\r\nembrace but do not penetrate the lower end of the nucellus. Each of\r\nthe two lateral strands branches in the outer flesh near its entrance\r\ninto the seed; the outer and larger collateral and mesarch bundle\r\npasses up close to the surface of the shell to the seed-apex, while the\r\ninner branch penetrates the shell and, occasionally branching, passes\r\nup the inner region of the inner flesh as far as the micropyle.\r\nIn other seeds the tracheal supply of the outer flesh consists of\r\nseveral bundles and not two as in _Cycas_. The inner flesh abuts on\r\nthe nucellus and is connected with it except at the apex (fig. 396,\r\nB). In ripe seeds the nucellus is reduced to a thin membrane enclosing\r\nthe large megaspore at the upper end of which is a depression (fig.\r\n396, B′) or sometimes two depressions (fig. 396, I) in the prothallus\r\ncontaining the archegonia. In the seed of _Dioon edule_[65] (fig. 396,\r\nA) the position of the absciss-layer (_s_) is indicated by a slight\r\ntransverse constriction. In the seeds of _Bowenia_, constructed on the\r\nsame plan, the inner series of vascular strands appears to be nucellar\r\nin position, thus differing from the strands in _Dioon_, _Cycas_, and\r\nother genera which are confined to the integument. Miss Kershaw[66] in\r\ndescribing _Bowenia_ speaks of an upper and a lower pollen-chamber; the\r\nformer serves as a storage-place for the microspores prior to their\r\nfurther development in the lower chamber. Dr Stopes[67] regards the\r\nintegument as double in origin, a view suggested by Griffith[68] in\r\n1835, and as homologous with the single integument _plus_ the cupule\r\nof _Lagenostoma_. This view is supported by Mrs Thoday[69]: on the\r\nother hand Miss Kershaw’s investigation of _Bowenia_ seeds leads her\r\nto regard the integument as single. Although there would seem to be a\r\n_prima facie_ case in favour of the dual nature of the integument, the\r\narguments on the other side have greater weight[70].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.\r\n\r\n  A.

(After Mettenius.)]\r\n\r\nRecent observations point to the probability that insects play a part\r\nin the pollination of cycadean ovules. Kraus[71] drew attention to the\r\nstrong smell emitted by the microstrobili of _Dioon edule_ and noticed\r\nthat small bees were attracted to the ripe strobili of _Macrozamia_,\r\nwhile odourless cones of a neighbouring _Ceratozamia_ received no\r\nattention. Pearson[72] and Rattray[73] have obtained evidence that\r\nbeetles and weevils act as pollinators to species of _Encephalartos_.\r\n\r\n_Anatomical features._ Allusion has already been made to some of the\r\nmore striking anatomical features; the large pith, the occasional\r\noccurrence of medullary vascular bundles, the presence of one or more\r\ncambiums, the large size of the medullary rays, etc. It is worthy of\r\nremark that the occurrence of an anastomosing system of medullary\r\nbundles is not a constant feature within a genus; in _Macrozamia\r\nFraseri_ such a system is present, but absent in _M. Denisoni_[74]. In\r\nthe pith of stems with no medullary bundles cylinders of collateral\r\nbundles may occur in connexion with a fertile shoot. These bundles\r\narise from the inner face of the main cylinder and pass upwards as\r\na domical system into the base of the terminal strobilus which is\r\neventually pushed to one side by the growth of a lateral bud[75].\r\nThe secondary xylem tracheids are usually provided with several\r\nrows of bordered pits on the radial walls and resemble those of the\r\nAraucarieae[76], but in Cycads the pits are often not contiguous\r\nand less compact in their distribution. The wood of _Stangeria_\r\nis peculiar in consisting of scalariform tracheids[77] (fig. 397).\r\nChamberlain describes growth-rings in the wood of _Dioon_; but this is\r\nexceptional. In tangential sections of the stele leaf-trace bundles\r\nare constantly seen passing horizontally through the broad and deep\r\nmedullary rays. The pith-cast of a cycadean stem reproduced in fig. 398\r\nshows the wide meshes in the reticulum of tracheal tissue originally\r\noccupied by parenchyma, which on decay left lenticular depressions\r\nrepresented on the cast by tapered convex areas occasionally bearing\r\nthe impress of an outgoing trace in the form of a narrow groove.\r\nThe secondary phloem often rivals the xylem in breadth and is not\r\nalways easily distinguishable from it; it consists of sieve-tubes,\r\nparenchyma, and fibres. The secondary cambial cylinders characteristic\r\nof _Cycas_, _Encephalartos_, _Macrozamia_, and _Bowenia_, to which\r\nreference was made in the summary of anatomical features, arise in the\r\npericycle, and a few layers of pericyclic parenchyma occur between\r\nadjacent extrafascicular cylinders of xylem and phloem. In a stem of\r\n_Cycas media_ 35 cm. in diameter examined by Worsdell there were 12\r\nconcentric cylinders. Matte[78] and Miss Dorety[79] have described\r\npartially flattened arcs of extrafascicular xylem and phloem in the\r\nhypocotyl of _Ceratozamia mexicana_. Worsdell[80] first drew attention\r\nto the occasional occurrence of short tracheids on the inner edge of\r\nthe secondary wood and to the spasmodic development of cambial arcs in\r\nthe tissue between the extrafascicular cylinders forming strands of\r\ninversely orientated xylem and phloem. More recent work by Matte gives\r\nsupport to Worsdell’s comparison between Medullosan stems and those of\r\nrecent Cycads with inversely orientated arcs or concentric vascular\r\ncylinders. The French author draws attention to the close resemblance\r\nbetween the seedling stems of such species as _Encephalartos Barteri_\r\n(fig. 396, K) and _Cycas siamensis_ (fig. 396, L) with their polystelic\r\ntype of structure and the adult stems of _Medullosa_[81]. In the stems\r\nof _Dioon_, _Microcycas_, _Stangeria_, and _Zamia_ no extrafascicular\r\ncylinders are recorded. Two main vascular bundles enter the cortex\r\nfrom each leaf-base and in most stems these diverge right and left\r\nand more or less completely encircle the stele before passing through\r\nthe medullary rays and joining the inner portion of the xylem of\r\nthe stele either as double or single bundles. These girdle-bundles\r\n(fig. 396, H) first described by Karsten and Mettenius form a very\r\ncharacteristic cycadean feature[82]. Adjacent girdles are joined\r\nby connecting cortical bundles and, in addition, there are cauline\r\ncollateral bundles in the cortex which form an anastomosing system.\r\nIn some cases, _e.g._ species of _Macrozamia_ and occasionally in\r\n_Stangeria_, the female peduncle of a _Ceratozamia_, and in seedlings\r\nof _Bowenia_ and _Cycas revoluta_[83], the leaf-traces pursue a direct\r\ncourse from petiole to stele as in stems of Bennettitales. It is\r\nnoteworthy that in seedlings of _Microcycas_[84], a genus characterised\r\nby a large number of male gametes—presumably a primitive feature—the\r\nleaf-traces are of the girdle-type. The two bundles at the base of a\r\npetiole by repeated subdivision give rise to the numerous collateral\r\nstrands of the rachis. A leaf-trace in its passage to the leaf is like\r\nthat of a Conifer in having the protoxylem on its inner edge, whereas\r\nin the petiole and elsewhere in the frond it is characterised by an\r\narrangement of the xylem that has usually been described as mesarch. A\r\ntypical vascular bundle from a cycadean frond is seen in fig. 399, C;\r\nby far the greater part of the xylem is centripetal, the centrifugal\r\nxylem being confined to an arc of scattered tracheids or a small strand\r\nseparated by a few parenchymatous cells from the protoxylem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397. Tracheids from the stem of _Stangeria\r\nparadoxa_. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398. Pith-cast of a _Macrozamia_ stem, (⅖ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399. Sketches illustrating the changes in the\r\nstructure of Cycadean vascular bundles in their course from stem to\r\nleaf: _cp_, _cf_, centripetal and centrifugal xylem; _p_, phloem; _px_,\r\nprotoxylem. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nAs considerable stress has been laid on the anatomical features of the\r\ncycadean foliar bundles in discussions on the affinities and phylogeny\r\nof certain Palaeozoic genera, it is important to consider the facts\r\nmore closely[85]. French anatomists described the cycadean bundle as\r\ndiploxylic on the ground that the centripetal and centrifugal xylems\r\nare distinctly different things, the centripetal xylem being primary—a\r\nrelic of a former organisation—and the centrifugal xylem secondary\r\nand homologous with the normal wood of the cauline bundle. The term\r\nmesarch has in recent years been applied to the cycadean type of\r\nbundle. A mesarch bundle is, however, one in which centripetal and\r\ncentrifugal xylem are alike in origin, both being primary structures\r\nderived from a desmogen strand. Typical mesarch bundles occur in\r\nseveral recent ferns; in the stele of the Osmundaceae, _Gleichenia_,\r\nand other genera; but in these plants the xylem is all produced\r\ndirectly from one primary desmogen region and there is no question of\r\n‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ as in the two portions of the xylem of a\r\ncycadean bundle. Recent researches into the development of cycadean\r\nfoliar bundles show that they do not conform to the mesarch type as\r\ngenerally understood. A leaf-trace at the base of a petiole (fig. 399,\r\nA) comprises centrifugal xylem only, and this consists of regular rows\r\nof tracheids separated by medullary rays: in the lower part of the\r\npetiole the structure is gradually modified, the centrifugal xylem\r\nis reduced and the formation of centripetal xylem is initiated. At a\r\nhigher level (fig. 399, B) the centripetal xylem is in excess of the\r\ncentrifugal and the latter, for a time connected with the former,\r\neventually becomes separated by a few parenchymatous cells from the\r\nprotoxylem and persists as a small strand or arc of tracheids. Fig.\r\n399 illustrates stages in the transformation of a typical collateral\r\nbundle, at the base of a _Stangeria_ petiole, into one in which the\r\nxylem is almost wholly centripetal at a higher level in the axis of\r\nthe frond. A cambium is present in all: in B the centrifugal xylem\r\nis more or less clearly differentiated into two portions, loosely\r\narranged tracheids near the phloem, and the more compact groups\r\nabutting on the centripetal xylem: figs. C–E show a further reduction\r\nin the centrifugal tracheids. The conclusion drawn from developmental\r\nstudy is that the two xylem portions of the bundle are independent\r\nin origin[86]. Marsh has, however, shown that in _Stangeria_ bundles\r\nnear the base of the petiole the centrifugal xylem consists of rows of\r\nsecondary tracheids and an inner portion not in rows which connects the\r\ncentrifugal with the centripetal elements; this connecting portion, he\r\nadds, is ‘probably primary and connects up the Cycadean foliar bundle\r\nwith the truly mesarch bundle of the Cycadofilices.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400. _Cycas Micholitzii_. Vascular bundles in\r\na forked pinna; _px_, protoxylem; _s_, sheath of thick-walled cells;\r\n_cf_, _cp_, centrifugal and centripetal xylem.]\r\n\r\nIn the xylem portion of the bundle from the midrib of a forked pinna\r\nof _Cycas Micholitzii_ shown in fig. 400 the centrifugal xylem\r\nelements are unusually numerous: the space between the two xylems\r\nis occupied by parenchyma and the whole strand is enclosed by a\r\nsheath of crystal-containing cells, _s_, with thick inner walls.\r\nFig. 400, 1–4, illustrates the gradual change in the form of the\r\nbundle in the region of dichotomy[87]. The ground-tissue of the\r\npetiole is abundantly supplied with secretory canals and in the\r\nhypodermal region is a cylinder of stereome. In some petioles, _e.g._\r\n_Macrozamia heteromera_[88], the ground-tissue cells are lignified\r\nand reticulately pitted, a feature met with in some Mesozoic cycadean\r\nleaves[89]. In _Cycas media_ Worsdell noticed a tendency of the\r\nleaf-trace bundles towards a concentric arrangement and similar\r\nvascular strands are recorded in the peduncle of _Dioon edule_, in\r\nvarious sporophylls[90] and in other cases. It is possible, as Worsdell\r\nbelieves, that the fairly frequent occurrence of concentric bundles\r\nin plants characterised by collateral bundles may have a phylogenetic\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe pinnae are dorsiventral and the veins exarch or pseudomesarch:\r\nsecretory canals occur between (_Encephalartos_), above, or below the\r\nveins. The mesophyll of _Cycas_ is characterised by the presence of\r\nisolated xylem-elements passing from the midrib to the edge of the\r\nlamina and, as Lignier[91] suggests, these may be regarded as a reduced\r\nsystem of lateral conducting strands.\r\n\r\nThe epidermal cells of the leaflets have straight or slightly curved\r\nwalls except in _Stangeria_ where they are undulate and fern-like[92].\r\nThe stomata, with few exceptions confined to the lower epidermis, are\r\nlarger than in other gymnosperms (on the average ·075 × ·034 mm.) and\r\nare more or less depressed below the surface; the guard-cells are\r\nusually surrounded by 4–6 subsidiary cells.\r\n\r\nThe roots exhibit no feature to which attention need be called: the\r\npericycle is several cells broad and as in the stem there may be\r\nextrafascicular cylinders of xylem and phloem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n                           PTERIDOSPERMEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LYGINOPTERIDEAE.\r\n\r\n  LYGINOPTERIS.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lyginopteris_ is selected for the first place in this\r\nchapter simply on the ground that we have a fuller knowledge of its\r\nmorphology than in the case of other types. It is not regarded as the\r\nmost primitive member of its class. _Lyginopteris_ may be described\r\nin a few words as a plant having the habit and to a large extent the\r\nanatomical features of a Fern, but differing from existing ferns in the\r\npossession of integumented megasporangia or seeds and in the power of\r\nsecondary growth in thickness by means of a cambium in both stem and\r\nroot. The seed (_Lagenostoma_) agrees with those of recent Cycads and\r\nGnetales more closely than with the corresponding organs in Conifers\r\nor any other group, while the structure of the secondary wood is\r\npractically identical with that of Cycads. The microsporangia occur\r\nas groups of small bilocular sporangia, or synangia, at the tips of\r\nfertile pinnae of highly compound fronds.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature and Historical Summary._ In 1866 E. W. Binney[93] of\r\nManchester published a short description of a small petrified stem\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire and named it _Dadoxylon\r\noldhamium_, employing Endlicher’s term _Dadoxylon_ which that author\r\nsubstituted for _Pinites_ as previously used by Witham[94]. Three\r\nyears later Williamson[95] drew attention to certain features in which\r\nBinney’s type differs from the genus _Dadoxylon_ and substituted a new\r\nname _Dictyoxylon_, suggested by the reticulate pitting on the walls\r\nof the tracheids. In a subsequent paper Williamson[96] gave a fuller\r\ndescription of Binney’s species and spoke of it as ‘one of the most\r\ncommon plants in the calcareous nodules of the Lower Coal Measures’ of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire. He connected certain casts of arborescent\r\ndimensions with Binney’s type on the ground that the surface-features\r\nof the casts are such as would be produced by partially decorticated\r\nstems having a hypodermal reticulum of mechanical tissue like that\r\npreserved in the small petrified specimen described by Binney (fig.\r\n402). Mr Carruthers called Williamson’s attention to a paper by Mr\r\nGourlie[97] in which the generic name _Lyginodendron_ is instituted\r\nfor stem-casts identical in surface-features with the fossils figured\r\nby Williamson. In spite of the much larger dimensions of the reticulum\r\non the casts described by Gourlie as compared with that in the outer\r\ncortex of Binney’s stem, Williamson concluded that _Lyginodendron_ is\r\n‘undoubtedly an inorganic cast of the prosenchymatous layer of the\r\nbark of _Dictyoxylon_.’ It is but fair to add that Williamson was\r\ninfluenced in coming to this conclusion by a discovery by Mr Nield of\r\na piece of a large petrified stem believed to be generically identical\r\nwith Binney’s type, but subsequently referred to a distinct genus[98],\r\nwhich was comparable in size with the stems responsible for Gourlie’s\r\n_Lyginodendron_ casts. The type-specimen of Gourlie’s _Lyginodendron\r\nLandsburgii_[99], from Carboniferous rocks at Stevenston in Ayrshire,\r\nScotland, is represented in fig. 401. The convex areas represent casts\r\nof depressions in a reticulum of cortical tissue, originally occupied\r\nby comparatively delicate cells, which decayed or shrunk more quickly\r\nthan the enclosing framework of stronger fibrous elements that remained\r\nas a prominent reticulum and produced the depressions bounding the\r\nraised portions of the cast. Such a cast would undoubtedly be formed\r\nby the stem on which Binney founded his species: the radially disposed\r\nbands of thick-walled cells seen in the outer part of the section (fig.\r\n402) are portions of an irregular anastomosing mechanical system, the\r\nreticulate arrangement of which is seen in the impression of a rachis\r\nof a _Lyginopteris_ frond shown in fig. 405, E, and indicated in the\r\nmore slender axis reproduced in fig. 404, A, _b_. This reticulate\r\nform of cortical stereome on which Brongniart founded the genus\r\n_Dictyoxylon_[100], a term since applied by Solms-Laubach and other\r\nauthors to a certain type of cortex not confined to a single genus of\r\nplants, occurs also in some Palaeozoic lycopodiaceous stems[101] and in\r\nitself cannot be regarded as a safe criterion of botanical affinity.\r\nThe largest example of Gourlie’s _Lyginodendron_ that has come under my\r\nnotice is an incomplete sandstone cast from Upper Carboniferous strata\r\nnear Harrogate reaching a length of 100 cm. and with convex areas 13\r\ncm. long. A similar cast, 36 cm. broad, has recently been figured by\r\nNathorst[102] from the Culm of Spitzbergen, and from the Upper Devonian\r\nof Ellesmere Land the same author has described impressions of a\r\ncortical reticulum under the name _Lyginodendron Sverdrupi_[103]. These\r\nspecimens are interesting as pointing to the former occurrence in the\r\nArctic regions of stems—probably Lepidodendroid—reaching the dimensions\r\nof a fairly large tree. As Potonié[104] pointed out, Gourlie’s generic\r\nname serves a useful purpose for casts of stems of the type shown in\r\nfig. 401 that cannot be assigned to a definite systematic position.\r\nThe genus was first used for a specimen which has nothing to do with\r\nthe plant usually spoken of as _Lyginodendron oldhamium_ (Binney).\r\nThough loath to give up a name by which Binney’s type has long been\r\nknown, in spite of its retention in the second volume of this work I\r\nfeel compelled so far to conform to the recognised principles governing\r\nnomenclature as to adopt Potonié’s generic term _Lyginopteris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401. _Lyginodendron Landsburgii_.

(After Arber.)]\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Stem_.\r\n\r\nThe petrified stem on which Binney founded the species was first\r\nfigured by Dr Arber[105] from a section in the Binney collection in\r\nthe Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge: this section (13 mm. in diameter)\r\nis reproduced in fig. 402. The most striking features are: (i) the\r\npith consisting of an unusually large and irregular group of dark\r\nthick-walled parenchyma, (ii) the broad cylinder of manoxylic secondary\r\nxylem characterised by multiseriate medullary rays, (iii) the outer\r\ncortex composed of dark radially disposed and oblique bands of\r\nmechanical tissue separated from one another by partially destroyed\r\nand tangentially elongated parenchymatous elements. It is this outer\r\ncortex that Williamson aptly compared with the Roman numerals on a\r\nclock-face. In the perimedullary region and in contact with the inner\r\nedge of the secondary-xylem cylinder are six strands of primary xylem\r\nrepresenting the xylem halves of collateral bundles separated from the\r\nprimary phloem strands by the intervening cylinder of secondary wood.\r\nTwo of the primary xylem strands in lateral contact are seen in fig.\r\n404, C; the other four occur as separate bundles. Each primary xylem\r\nstrand contains a small group of spirally thickened protoxylem elements\r\n(_px_) associated with a few parenchymatous cells. The large primary\r\ntracheids internal to the protoxylem are characterised by multiseriate\r\nbordered pits on their walls, while those external to the protoxylem,\r\nwhich are in contact with the innermost secondary tracheids, have\r\nscalariform pitting. The dark patch _s_ (fig. 404, C) is a portion of\r\nthe large group of sclerenchymatous cells, shown in figs. 402, 403.\r\nThe perimedullary xylem strands of mesarch structure are the lower\r\nportions of leaf-traces and, as Scott points out, ‘each of the bundles\r\nsurrounding the pith is, in fact, a sympodium, composed of the united\r\nlower ends of successive adjacent leaf-traces.’ The larger of the two\r\nbundles shown in fig. 404, C, is on the point of passing out to a leaf,\r\nwhile the smaller strand is on its way to a higher level before bending\r\noutwards through the secondary wood. Slightly beyond the middle of the\r\nsecondary xylem there is an arc of narrower tracheids comparable with\r\nan incomplete annual ring. Although zones or arcs of narrow tracheids\r\nare not uncommon in the wood of _Lyginopteris_ there is no satisfactory\r\nevidence of regularly recurring seasonal changes. On the outer face of\r\nthe secondary wood are a few leaf-trace strands pursuing a vertical\r\ncourse in the pericycle region; but the structure and behaviour of\r\nthese bundles are more clearly illustrated in the stem reproduced in\r\nfig. 403. The tissue between the crushed phloem and pericycle and the\r\nouter cortex (fig. 402) consists of radially compressed parenchyma with\r\nscattered secretory cells separated from the more internal tissue by a\r\nnarrow band of periderm formed by a phellogen in the outer part of the\r\npericycle.\r\n\r\nA larger and better preserved stem, 3·7 cm. in diameter, is seen\r\nin fig. 403. In this stem the pith of parenchyma and scattered\r\nsclerenchymatous nests is larger in proportion to the stele than\r\nin Binney’s type-specimen. From the inner edge of the secondary\r\nxylem several primary xylem-strands project as rounded wedges\r\nor tangentially elongated groups where two traces are laterally\r\nunited in the perimedullary zone. The cylinder of secondary wood\r\nis partially interrupted at _r_ by the bending outwards of the stele\r\nof an adventitious root cut across transversely as it bends down\r\nafter emerging from the outer cortical region. In more or less close\r\nassociation with the outer surface of the secondary xylem are four\r\npairs of leaf-trace bundles and one larger trace at _d_ containing\r\ntwo widely separated protoxylem strands and faced externally with\r\nan arc of secondary xylem: this is a leaf-trace which shows by the\r\nslight constriction on the outer edge of its primary xylem that it is\r\nbeginning to divide into a pair of equal strands. A precisely similar\r\nstrand is shown on a larger scale in fig. 404, D. The twin bundles\r\nseen at _b_, fig. 403, represent a divided leaf-trace at a slightly\r\nhigher level than the partially severed trace at _d_, and the arcs of\r\nsecondary xylem are narrower. The appearance of the double leaf-trace\r\nat a still higher level is shown at _c_: the two strands are farther\r\napart and the secondary xylem has almost disappeared, while those at\r\n_e_, nearer their entrance into the leaf-stalk, consist exclusively of\r\nprimary xylem and phloem. At _a_ the two strands of a leaf-trace, still\r\nnearer to the petiole, are inclined towards one another preparatory\r\nto reunion after reaching the leaf-stalk. A slender root is seen in\r\ntransverse section at _r′_ immediately outside the two leaf-bundles.\r\nAs Williamson and Scott[106] have pointed out, there are always five\r\nleaf-traces beyond the xylem cylinder of a _Lyginopteris_ stem as seen\r\nin transverse section, and these traces in the pericycle, separated\r\nfrom one another by ⅔ of the circumference, alternate in position with\r\nthe lower portions of leaf-traces in the perimedullary region of the\r\nsame stem. The phyllotaxis is thus seen to be ⅖.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403. _Lyginopteris oldhamia._ _a–e_, foliar\r\nbundles; _f_, decurrent base of petiole; _r_, _r′_, roots; _s_, seed\r\n(_Lagenostoma_). (× 3. Kidston Coll. 592, B.)]\r\n\r\nThe secondary wood is succeeded by a cambium of normal structure\r\npassing gradually into a narrow band of secondary phloem which in\r\nwell-preserved stems is seen to consist of sieve-tubes and parenchyma\r\nwith medullary rays rather broader than those in the xylem. Beyond the\r\nphloem is the comparatively broad pericycle consisting of parenchyma\r\nwith nests of sclerenchyma like those in the pith and scattered\r\nsecretory cells. In the outer layers of the pericycle a phellogen\r\nwas formed at an early stage in the growth of the plant, producing\r\nseveral layers of secondary tissue, which is regarded as periderm and\r\nforms a conspicuous feature in _Lyginopteris_ stems; it appears as a\r\ncomparatively dark sinuous band where it bends outwards to wrap round\r\nthe leaf-traces in their almost vertical course through the pericyclic\r\nregion (fig. 403). The periderm is clearly seen at _p_ close to the\r\ncrushed secondary phloem of the dividing leaf-trace in fig. 404, D. All\r\nthe leaf-traces seen in fig. 403 beyond the secondary wood are still\r\nwithin the deep-seated periderm and, as Williamson and Scott showed,\r\neach leaf-trace after emerging from the secondary wood remains in the\r\npericycle-zone for a length of five internodes as it very gradually\r\ninclines outwards. Once free from this region the twin bundles bend\r\nmore sharply towards the petiole. Stated briefly, the history of\r\neach leaf-trace from the perimedullary region to the leaf-base is as\r\nfollows: at the outer edge of the pith a single trace consists of a\r\nmesarch xylem bundle with one protoxylem strand; it passes vertically\r\nthrough five internodes and then bends out through a foliar gap in\r\nthe xylem-cylinder, and the primary tracheids receive additions from\r\nthe cambium of the stele on their outer face. As the trace leaves the\r\nsecondary xylem it bends upwards and, as seen at _d_, fig. 403, begins\r\nto divide into twin bundles. As the trace passes higher the bisection\r\nof the protoxylem and metaxylem is completed and the secondary\r\nxylem-arcs are gradually lost until the separate strands of each pair\r\nare reduced to single mesarch bundles composed wholly of primary\r\ntracheids. As the trace bends outwards through the cortex the phloem\r\ngradually encircles each xylem-strand until a concentric structure is\r\nsubstituted for the collateral disposition of the conducting tissue.\r\nAt the same time the protoxylem strands divide and occupy a position\r\nnear the inner edge of the metaxylem. On reaching the petiole or after\r\npassing some distance up the axis of the frond, the twin bundles unite\r\nand usually form a V-shaped vascular strand (figs. 404, E; 405, A).\r\nThe single meristele subsequently divides into two equal portions\r\npreparatory to the bifurcation of the petiole (fig. 406).\r\n\r\nThe inner cortex, consisting of parenchymatous tissue and many\r\nsecretory cells with an occasional group of sclerenchymatous elements\r\nin place of the abundant nests of this tissue in the pericycle, has\r\nbeen invaded in the stem shown in fig. 403 by numerous rootlets of\r\n_Stigmaria_ and _Lyginopteris_, some of which are seen interrupting\r\nthe continuity of the outer cortex. The greater width of the cortical\r\nregion at _f_, fig. 403, is due to the decurrent base of a petiole\r\nthe meristele of which is not included in the section. The lighter\r\nand broader bands between the cross-sections of the stereome-network\r\nin the outer cortex are occupied by remains of tangentially stretched\r\nparenchymatous cells, and beyond this zone in a younger stem there are\r\na few layers of parenchyma forming the superficial tissue, but there\r\nappears to be no well-defined epidermal layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404. _Lyginopteris oldhamia._\r\n\r\n  A, B.

Botany School, 93, 159.)]\r\n\r\nYoung stems have been recognised in which there is very little\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem: in these the stereome bands in the outer\r\ncortex are closer together than in the stretched hypodermal tissue\r\nof older shoots and the scattered sclerous nests are represented by\r\nunthickened cells. In addition to young stems Williamson and Scott\r\ndescribed a distinct type of small stem in which the primary xylem\r\nforms an almost complete ring[107] comparable with the primary xylem of\r\nsome adult Sigillarian stems (vol. +ii.+ p. 220) but distinguished by\r\nits mesarch structure and by the reticulate pitting of the centripetal\r\nxylem.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of the stem is the occurrence of emergences\r\nfrom the outer cortex which have the structure either of spinous\r\nprocesses, broadly linear or flask-shaped, or of stalked glands[108]. A\r\nportion of a glandular emergence is shown in fig. 405, B: the group of\r\nsmall cells immediately below the blunt apex is in this instance still\r\nintact though showing signs of disorganisation in the centre; but in\r\nmany cases the secretory tissue has not been preserved and the head of\r\nthe emergence is occupied by a space. A single stoma is seen at _s_ in\r\nlongitudinal section. Further reference to the emergences is made in\r\nthe description of the leaf.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that a meristematic layer is formed in the\r\nparenchymatous tissue immediately internal to some of the perimedullary\r\nxylem strands of a _Lyginopteris_ stem from which either secondary\r\nparenchyma is produced or a zone of secondary xylem and phloem, the\r\nphloem facing the centre of the pith. An example of such internal\r\nxylem was figured by Williamson[109] and similar occurrences are\r\nmore fully dealt with by Williamson and Scott[110] who consider that\r\nthe perimedullary cambium may represent an internal extension through\r\na leaf-gap of the normal cambial cylinder. In the stem represented\r\nin fig. 403 there are two perimedullary xylem strands to the left\r\nof the bottom of the V-shaped gap in the secondary xylem-cylinder,\r\n_r_, and on the inner face of one of these, as shown in fig. 405, C,\r\nthere is a narrow arc of internal secondary xylem, _c_, between the\r\nxylem-strand and the outer edge of one of the sclerous nests. The\r\nsporadic occurrence of arcs of inversely orientated secondary vascular\r\ntissue affords an interesting parallel with a similar morphological\r\nfeature in some recent Dicotyledonous genera such as _Tecoma_ and\r\n_Iodes_. As Williamson and Scott point out, this similarity affords ‘a\r\nstriking warning against the _indiscriminate_ use of even conspicuous\r\nanatomical characters[111].’ While admitting the necessity of guarding\r\nagainst the danger of attaching importance to occasional and abnormal\r\ncharacters they may have some significance as collateral evidence in\r\ncomparisons of different types of stems. It is conceivable that these\r\nanomalous arcs of secondary tissue on the inner side of the primary\r\nxylem strands may, as Worsdell[112] maintains, be reversions to an\r\nancestral character and in this sense comparable with the strands of\r\ninverted vascular tissue in some recent Cycadean stems. The question of\r\nrelationship of _Lyginopteris_ and allied types to recent Cycads and\r\nthe Palaeozoic Medulloseae is considered in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Lomax[113] described two branching specimens of _Lyginopteris_,\r\nand more recently two others have been discovered at a locality\r\nnear Bacup in Lancashire which have been thoroughly investigated by\r\nMiss Brenchley[114] who constructed models from drawings of serial\r\nsections[115]. One specimen shows six leaf-bases in a length of 4¾\r\ninches and branches spring from the axils of five of them: some of\r\nthe branches show secondary ramifications. The phyllotaxis of the\r\nleaf-bases on a branch is always the reverse of that on the main stem,\r\na divergence to which no parallel was found in a selection of trees\r\nand shrubs examined by Miss Brenchley. The secondary wood of the stem\r\nswells below the point of exit of a branch and frequently a fairly\r\nlarge amount of wood occurs in the pith when a branch is given off:\r\nthis anomalous wood may help to close the branch-gap.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Leaf_.\r\n\r\nIn his account of _Lyginopteris_ stems published in 1873\r\nWilliamson[116] suggested that the vascular bundles met with outside\r\nthe xylem-cylinder might be the leaf-traces of large fronds and\r\nexpressed the opinion that the ‘stems or petioles’ previously\r\ndescribed by him under the generic name _Edraxylon_ might belong to\r\n_Lyginopteris_. A year later he substituted the name _Rachiopteris\r\naspera_ for the petioles previously referred to _Edraxylon_ and\r\ninclined to the view that this type of _Rachiopteris_ may be\r\nthe petiole of the Carboniferous fronds known as _Sphenopteris\r\nHoeninghausi_ Brongn., an inference based to a large extent on the\r\noccurrence of emergences on _Rachiopteris aspera_ (fig. 404, E)\r\npreserved as petrifactions like those on impressions of _Sphenopteris\r\nHoeninghausi_ as figured by Brongniart (figs. 404, A; 405, D, D’). In\r\n1890 Williamson was able to demonstrate the truth of the surmise that\r\n_Rachiopteris aspera_ and _Lyginopteris oldhamia_ are respectively\r\nthe petiole and stem of the same plant, which he believed to be an\r\narborescent fern[117]. The petioles of _Lyginopteris_ fronds, which\r\nmay reach a diameter of 1 cm., are attached by a broad base to the\r\nstem, and as already suggested by the number of internodes traversed by\r\neach leaf-trace, the leaves are comparatively far apart. A transverse\r\nsection of a petiole is shown diagrammatically in fig. 405 A. The\r\nhypodermal stereome is a prominent feature, but the narrow radial\r\nplates of the stem-cortex tend to be replaced in the rachis by broader\r\nand confluent masses of strengthening elements: the upper surface of\r\nthe petiole is slightly grooved. Glandular and spinous emergences\r\nare often very abundant, as in the section reproduced in fig. 404,\r\nE. A glandular emergence is seen at _a_ in fig. 405, A. The spinous\r\nemergences may be compared with those of _Davallia_ (_Odontosoria_)\r\n_aculeata_[118], a West Indian fern of climbing habit and with the\r\nprickles on _Hemitelia_ and other recent Cyatheaceous fronds[119],\r\nwhile capitate glands, though simpler than those of _Lyginopteris_,\r\noccur on the leaf-stalks of some recent Polypodiaceous species[120].\r\nThe concentric meristele may consist in the lower part of the petiole\r\nof two separate and slightly curved strands like those seen in fig.\r\n404, E, _m_: sooner or later the two strands unite to form a wide-open\r\nV or a W-shaped bundle with several slightly internal protoxylem\r\ngroups close to the lower edge. The two sections represented in fig.\r\n406, A and B show the gradual divergence of the two meristeles of a\r\npetiole as they approach the level where it divides into two equal\r\nbranches, a characteristic feature of _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_ and\r\nallied fronds. At a lower level than that represented in fig. 406 the\r\nvascular strand of the petiole would have the form of a W as figured\r\nby Williamson in one of his earlier memoirs[121]. The phloem with\r\nscattered secretory sacs and the adjacent tissue of the leaf-stalk are\r\noccasionally preserved in wonderful perfection[122]. No endodermis has\r\nbeen recognised. Sclerous nests are scattered in the ground-tissue as\r\nare also secretory sacs (figs. 404, E; 405, A). A small root _r_ has\r\npenetrated the parenchyma of the rachis shown in fig. 405, A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405. _Lyginopteris oldhamia_.

(From a drawing supplied by\r\nProf. Oliver.)]\r\n\r\n_Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_ Brongn.[123], founded on material from\r\nEnglish Coal Measures, was regarded by Williamson as the foliage of\r\n_Lyginopteris_ chiefly on the ground of the occurrence of emergences on\r\nthe axes (figs. 404, A, B) and laminae of the impressions like those\r\non the petrified stems, and this comparison received support from the\r\nresemblance of the fragments of pinnules associated with _Lyginopteris_\r\nand its petioles in the calcareous nodules to the leaflets of\r\nBrongniart’s type. This identification is supported by subsequent work.\r\nThe quadripinnate fronds, which attain a considerable size, resemble\r\nthose of recent species of _Davallia_ and other ferns, but the forking\r\nof the rachis and branches of the frond is a striking feature: the\r\npinnae may reach a length of 15 cm.[124] The portion of carbonised\r\nrachis shown in fig. 405, E, reveals the existence of a hypodermal\r\nreticulum like that in the outer cortex of a _Lyginopteris_ stem and\r\nthe same feature is seen in the more slender axis represented in fig.\r\n404, A, at _b_.[125] The pinnules are usually deeply lobed and the\r\nsegments may be comparatively broad and blunt or narrow[126] (fig. 290,\r\nC, vol. +ii.+ p. 399; fig. 404, A, _a_, B; fig. 405, D’). The lamina\r\nhas a well marked dorsiventral structure: the palisade-tissue next\r\nthe upper surface is separated from the epidermis by small hypodermal\r\ncells, possibly functioning as a water-storage layer, and the central\r\npart of the mesophyll consists of loose aerenchyma: the veins are\r\ncollateral as in recent ferns and stomata occur in the lower epidermis.\r\nEmergences are seen both on impressions (fig. 405, D’) and on petrified\r\nspecimens. A striking feature of the pinnules is the rounded surface\r\ncaused by the revolute edge of the lamina as seen in the section\r\nreproduced in fig. 404, B. This character coupled with the occasional\r\noccurrence of groups of short tracheal elements at the termination of\r\nthe veins denotes a tendency to a xerophilous habit.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of a very close resemblance between _Sphenopteris\r\nHoeninghausi_ and _Calymmatotheca Stangeri_ (fig. 408, E,\r\nF)—characterised by fertile pinnules bearing stellate groups\r\nof small linear valves, regarded by Stur as the open lobes of\r\nan indusium—Zeiller included Brongniart’s type in the genus\r\n_Calymmatotheca_. The resemblance in general habit between the two\r\nspecies extends to the presence in their rachises of the _Dictyoxylon_\r\nform of cortex[127]. The view formerly held by some authors that the\r\nvalve-like appendages to the fertile segments of _Calymmatotheca_ are\r\nsporangia is incorrect: a re-examination of Stur’s specimen (fig.\r\n408, E, F) has confirmed the original description[128]. The stellate\r\nlobes are now regarded as portions of a cupular investment of a seed\r\nsimilar to _Lagenostoma Lomaxi_, the female reproductive apparatus of\r\n_Lyginopteris oldhamia_. The axes of the fertile pinnae bear small\r\nthorn-like emergences probably identical with those on the cupule of\r\n_Lagenostoma_ and on the petioles of _Lyginopteris oldhamia_. It was\r\nstated in vol. +ii+ that the fronds known as _Sphenopteris Linkii_\r\n(Goepp.) represent, with other closely allied forms, leaves belonging\r\nto _Heterangium_ stems. This statement was based on a misconception:\r\nthe rachis of _Sphenopteris Linkii_, as I have satisfied myself by\r\nan examination of impressions shown to me by Dr Kidston, exhibits\r\nthe reticulate pattern characteristic of _Lyginopteris_ and not the\r\ntransverse ribs characteristic of _Heterangium_.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy task even for those most familiar with Carboniferous\r\nfronds to distinguish clearly between species agreeing generally with\r\n_Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_, a species regarded by some authors as the\r\ntype of a group of very similar and closely allied forms all of which\r\nwere probably borne on stems referable to the genus _Lyginopteris_.\r\nThe species _Lyginopteris oldhamia_ as generally understood probably\r\nincludes more than one specific type, and it is safe to assert that\r\nin the Carboniferous period _Lyginopteris_ was represented by several\r\nforms characterised by highly compound fronds with forked rachises like\r\n_Sphenopteris Linkii_, _S. Hoeninghausi_, and others. The features\r\ncharacteristic of fronds included in the _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_\r\ngroup have recently been described by Gothan[129]. Stur’s generic name\r\n_Calymmatotheca_ originally applied to the species _C. Stangeri_ was\r\napplied to _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_ by Zeiller, and although the\r\nfronds of the latter type have not been found with fertile appendages\r\nof the _Calymmatotheca_ type there can be no doubt as to the generic\r\nidentity of these, barely distinguishable, species both of which belong\r\nto stems of _Lyginopteris_. Prof. Johnson[130] has recently described\r\nsome impressions from the Coal Measures of Ireland, which he refers\r\nto _S. Hoeninghausi_, bearing stellate groups of lobes like those of\r\n_Calymmatotheca_, and in one case he describes a seed in the middle of\r\nthe carbonised remains of a stellate group of cupular segments. An\r\nexamination of the specimen in Dublin convinced me that there is no\r\nsatisfactory evidence of the seed-nature of the appearance on the rock\r\nbelieved by Johnson to be an elliptical _Lagenostoma_-like seed. The\r\nactual attachment of the stellate lobes to the pinnae of the frond is\r\nnot clearly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Microsporangia._\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Kidston[131] announced the discovery of microsporangia on\r\nfronds of _Lyginopteris_: he described specimens from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Dudley identified by him with _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_\r\nshowing sterile and fertile pinnae in organic connexion. The fertile\r\npinnules (fig. 407, B) are slightly expanded distally into an oval\r\nlimb about 2 mm. long bearing 6 to 7 bilocular fusiform microsporangia\r\n3 mm. long and 1·5 mm. broad: in the immature condition the sorus is\r\nhemispherical, the summit being formed of the incurved apices of the\r\nsporangia. At maturity the sporangia spread out, the sorus assuming\r\nthe form of an epaulet. Fig. 408, H, shows a sorus in transverse\r\nsection and in fig. 408, G, the limb and two pendulous sporangia are\r\nshown. The microspores, 50–70 µ in diameter, are studded with numerous\r\nblunt spines and each spore shows a triradiate ridge. The section\r\nreproduced in fig. 407, A, from the Coal Measures of Oldham is probably\r\na bilocular sporangium of the same type as those described by Kidston\r\nfrom Dudley. Dr Kidston[132] describes a second type of microsporangial\r\nsorus as _Crossotheca Hughesiana_ which agrees closely with _C.\r\nHoeninghausi_, but the fertile segments are not associated with any\r\nsterile pinnae. The generic name _Crossotheca_, founded by Zeiller[133]\r\nin 1883, was substituted for _Sphenopteris_ on the ground that\r\nBrongniart’s species _S. Hoeninghausi_ is shown to possess sporangia\r\nof the _Crossotheca_ type. If Kidston’s specific determination is\r\ncorrect, his discovery demonstrates that _Lyginopteris_ fronds\r\nbore microsporangia having the characters of _Crossotheca_, a type\r\ncharacteristic of several Carboniferous species belonging both to the\r\nform-genera _Sphenopteris_ and _Pecopteris_. Reference has already\r\nbeen made to the difficulty of distinguishing between impressions\r\nof fronds of the _Sphenopteris_ _Hoeninghausi_ group, a difficulty\r\nthat is illustrated by Dr Gothan’s statement[134] that the Dudley\r\nspecimens of _Crossotheca_ are not identical in the character of the\r\nsterile pinnules with _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_. An examination of Dr\r\nKidston’s specimens led me to agree with his determination; but, it may\r\nbe asked, have we any evidence of the association with _Lyginopteris_\r\nfronds of sporangia other than those of the _Crossotheca_ type? Prof.\r\nChodat[135] believes that certain petrified fragments of pinnules\r\noccasionally met with in the calcareous nodules bearing sessile\r\nand apparently annulate sporangia belong to _Lyginopteris_ fronds.\r\nThese sporangia appear to be identical with those named by Scott\r\n_Pteridotheca Butterworthi_[136] and regarded by him as filicean\r\nsporangia that cannot be referred to any known Carboniferous genus. The\r\npiece of lamina bearing an empty sporangium, which may or may not have\r\npossessed an annulus, reproduced in fig. 407, C, occurs in association\r\nwith the larger specimen shown in fig. 404, B, and it would seem not\r\nunreasonable to regard both as parts of the same frond, namely a\r\nfrond of _Lyginopteris_. As Prof. Weiss[137] points out, the accurate\r\ndetermination of small pieces of petrified pinnules is exceedingly\r\ndifficult and without more decisive evidence we are hardly justified in\r\nasserting that the sporangia figured by Chodat and Scott and that shown\r\nin fig. 407 belong to the genus _Lyginopteris_. Although the available\r\ndata appear to favour the view generally held that Kidston’s conclusion\r\nis correct additional evidence would be welcome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407. A, B. _Crossotheca Hoeninghausi._ C. Pinnule\r\nwith a sporangium, _s_. (A, Kidston Coll. 1277; B, after Kidston; C,\r\nCamb. Botany School, 508.)]\r\n\r\n_Telangium._ Reference was made in vol. +ii.+[138] to the genus\r\n_Telangium_ instituted by Dr Benson for some petrified sporangia\r\nfrom the Coal Measures regarded by her as the microsporangia of a\r\nPteridosperm, probably _Lyginopteris_. The sporangia of _Telangium_\r\nare similar to those of _Crossotheca_. Scott points out that they\r\nare borne on a flat disc or lamina ‘quite comparable to a fertile\r\npinna of _Crossotheca_[139],’ and he concludes that these sporangia\r\nare not generically distinct from the impressions on which the genus\r\n_Crossotheca_ was founded. Kidston[140] regards _Telangium Scotti_,\r\nBenson, as the microsporangium of a Pteridosperm though not of\r\n_Lyginopteris_, on the ground that the microsporangia described by\r\nMiss Benson are not attached to a limb and that they have a single\r\nloculus in place of the double loculus (fig. 407, A) of _Crossotheca_.\r\nThe presence of a limb in _Telangium_ recognised by Scott removes one\r\nof these distinguishing features. There are, however, no adequate\r\nreasons for regarding _Telangium Scotti_ as specifically identical with\r\n_Crossotheca Hoeninghausi_. The synangium of _Telangium Scotti_, 5 mm.\r\nin length, consists of 6–12 sporangia united basally and opening when\r\nripe by longitudinal dehiscence. Fig. 493, E, shows eight sporangia\r\nof a synangium in transverse section: the two sporangia at the lower\r\nend of the section are less distinct than the others, some are full\r\nof spores and others have shed their contents by the splitting of\r\nthe thin inner walls of the loculi. The sporangial walls are composed\r\nof an outer layer of large cells with dark contents succeeded by 2–3\r\nlayers of smaller and crushed cells. The spores, 5–6 µ × 3·5–4 µ in\r\ndiameter, have a reticulately sculptured exine: Dr Benson[141] states\r\nthat they agree closely with pollen-grains found in the pollen-chamber\r\nof _Lagenostoma ovoides_ except in their slightly smaller size; she\r\nnotes the association of _Telangium_ with fragments of the vegetative\r\norgans of _Lyginopteris_ and draws attention to resemblances in the\r\nstructure of the tissues; but the most interesting comparison, at least\r\nin an academic sense, is with the seed _Lagenostoma_, the integumented\r\nmegasporangium of _Lyginopteris_. Dr Benson points out that a\r\ntransverse section of a _Lagenostoma_ in the plane of the canopy,\r\nshowing the nucellar apex surrounded by radially disposed chambers\r\n(fig. 409), presents a certain resemblance to a synangium of _Telangium\r\nScotti_; and it is suggested that the chambers encircling the nucellus\r\nmay represent sterilised sister-sporangia[142]. ‘The seed in fact is\r\nassumed to be a synangium in which all but one of the sporangia are\r\nsterile, and form an integument to the one fertile sporangium which\r\nhas become a megasporangium with one large megaspore.’ This view,\r\nthough clearly incapable of confirmation in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, is not merely an ingenious hypothesis but a stimulating\r\nsuggestion as to possible homologies: as an argument in favour of\r\nassociating _Lagenostoma_ and _Telangium_ as the spore-bearing organs\r\nof the same plant it has but little weight.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. _The Seed._ =Lagenostoma= Williamson.\r\n\r\n_Lagenostoma Lomaxi_, Oliver and Scott ex Williamson, +MS.+\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Williamson[143] proposed the generic name _Lagenostoma_ for\r\nsome petrified seeds from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire and\r\ndescribed two species, _Lagenostoma ovoides_ and _L. physoides_: in his\r\n+MS.+ Catalogue a third type is referred to as _Lagenostoma Lomaxi_. It\r\nis this third type that Prof. Oliver was the first to recognise as the\r\nmegaspore-bearing organ of _Lyginopteris oldhamia_. Its structure has\r\nbeen thoroughly described by Oliver and Scott[144] and these authors\r\ncontribute a judicial summary of the evidence on which _Lagenostoma_\r\nand _Lyginopteris_ are believed to stand for one and the same plant.\r\nThe evidence is based chiefly on the following considerations: an\r\nagreement in the structure of the vascular bundles in the investments\r\nof the seed with those in the leaves of _Lyginopteris_; the presence\r\nin the outer envelope of the seed of stalked glands identical with\r\nthose on the stems and petioles. The evidence does not as yet amount\r\nto absolute proof, as the seeds, which occur either with or without\r\na stalk, have not been found attached to a _Lyginopteris_ frond.\r\nBut ‘where vegetative and reproductive organs presenting identical\r\nstructural features, not known to occur in other plants, are thus found\r\nin close and constant association, the inference that the one belonged\r\nto the other appears irresistible.’ While most botanists believe that\r\na satisfactory case is established there are a few[145] who refuse to\r\nbelieve in a connexion between _Lagenostoma_ and _Lyginopteris_ until\r\nan actual union has been demonstrated. The discovery by Kidston[146]\r\nof seeds attached to pinnae bearing _Neuropteris_ pinnules and the\r\ndemonstration of organic continuity between seeds and the pinnules of\r\nother Palaeozoic fern-like fronds supply abundant confirmatory evidence\r\nthat leaves no doubt as to the occurrence of seeds on modified pinnae\r\nof _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_ and of other closely allied fronds which\r\nrepresent the foliage of different forms of _Lyginopteris_. In this\r\nconnexion it is pertinent to add that Grand’Eury[147] has found seeds\r\nof the _Lagenostoma_ type in close association with impressions of\r\n_Sphenopteris Dubuissonis_ and other leaves of similar habit.\r\n\r\nA seed of _Lagenostoma Lomaxi_ reaches a length of 5·5 mm. with a\r\nmaximum diameter of 4·4 mm.; it is broadly oval or barrel-like (fig.\r\n408, C) and when immature was invested by a loose irregularly lobed\r\nglandular envelope (fig. 408, B) from which the seed eventually\r\nfreed itself by a natural process of abscission. The central body or\r\nnucellus, except in the apical region, is concrescent with a fairly\r\nstout integument or testa (fig. 408, C, _f_) the outer portion of\r\nwhich is characterised by regular longitudinal rows of palisade-like\r\ncells comparable with the broad palisade-layer in the sporocarp of\r\n_Pilularia_. On the exposed surface of this palisade-tissue are small\r\ndark structureless pegs[148], possibly the remains of a mucilaginous\r\nlayer such as occurs on the seed-coats of some recent Flowering\r\nplants. At the base of the nucellus the chalazal region, fig. 408, C,\r\n_ch_, is provided with sclerous elements and forms a hard investment\r\nto the axial vascular strand from the pedicel. It is at the base\r\nof this chalazal region that the seed is eventually cut off by an\r\nabsciss-layer. The integument is supplied throughout its length by nine\r\nvascular bundles of endarch, or approximately endarch, structure. The\r\nfree portion of the integument seen from the outside (fig. 408, B) has\r\nthe form of a fluted cone with a circular opening at its summit. The\r\ngreater part of this domical apex, as seen in longitudinal section in\r\nfig. 408, C, appears to be hollow, but in the living state the dome, or\r\ncanopy as Williamson called it, was filled with parenchyma in which the\r\nvascular bundles were embedded and, as shown in the transverse section\r\nin fig. 409, the canopy is divided into compartments by radial septa\r\nwhich in its basal region are replaced by regular and deep furrows\r\non the inner face. Enclosed by the canopy, with its outer surface\r\nfluted as the result of the partial collapse of the outer wall of each\r\ncompartment due to the decay of the filling tissue, is the flask-shaped\r\napex of the nucellus; between the apical cone of nucellar parenchyma\r\nand the superficial layer is an annular cavity which Williamson[149]\r\ncalled the lagenostome. The parenchymatous core tapers to a narrow\r\nsummit which slightly overtops the integument and is constricted at the\r\nbroad base (fig. 493, A, B; page 311). The bottle-shaped apical tissue\r\nis separated by an annular space, _c_, fig. 493, B, from the limiting\r\nlayer of the nucellus: this space is the pollen-chamber formed in the\r\nliving seed by the disorganisation of the subepidermal cells of the\r\nnucellar apex. The pollen-chamber is a feature characteristic of recent\r\ncycadean ovules (see p. 6). In _Lagenostoma_ the annular form of the\r\npollen-chamber is a peculiarity distinguishing this type of seed from\r\nthose of recent Gymnosperms and most other Palaeozoic seeds. As Oliver\r\nsays, it marks an ‘advance in precision’[150] over other forms as the\r\nmicrospores which fall into the chamber are brought direct to the\r\nsurface of the underlying megaspore and presumably to the archegonia\r\nwhich, it is reasonable to believe, were disposed in a circle at the\r\nbase of the annular crevice. Microspores frequently occur in the\r\npollen-chamber and some have been discovered apparently in the act of\r\nliberating male gametes[151].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.

(After Oliver.)]\r\n\r\nThe outer wall of the nucellus is bounded externally by a similar\r\ncircular space (_d_, figs. 408, C; 493, B) which separates it from the\r\ndomical canopy. In the great majority of specimens the central tissue\r\nof the seed is not preserved and an empty sac supported from the base\r\nof the nucellus-apex occupies nearly the whole of the interior: the\r\nshrunken wall of the sac is all that remains of the large megaspore.\r\nIt would seem, then, that the nucellus was almost completely destroyed\r\nas a consequence of the growth of the megaspore or embryo-sac, which\r\neventually occupied nearly the whole of the seed-body.\r\n\r\nIn an exceptionally well preserved specimen recently described and\r\nadmirably illustrated by Mr McLean[152] part of the parenchymatous\r\ntissue of the prothallus which originally filled the megaspore is\r\nclearly seen: its surface-layer consists of small cells succeeded by\r\na broad band of radially elongated elements closely resembling the\r\nalveoli in the prothalli of some recent Gymnosperms, particularly\r\ncertain Conifers. No archegonia have been discovered. The cupular\r\nenvelope of immature seeds, compared by Oliver and Scott with the\r\nlobed and glandular husk of _Corylus colurna_ L.[153], receives\r\nseveral vascular bundles of collateral and mesarch structure from the\r\naxial strand, and these subdivide as they ascend. The glands which\r\noccur on all parts of the cupule are sessile or stalked and identical\r\nwith those on the vegetative organs of _Lyginopteris_. Assuming that\r\npollination occurred at a comparatively early stage in the development\r\nof the seed when the cupule was still intact, it is conceivable, as\r\nSir Joseph Hooker suggested, that the glandular secretion may have\r\nattracted insects and so aided in the transport of pollen which were\r\nperhaps drawn down the narrow pollen-chamber by exuded mucilage as in\r\nrecent Conifers. The evidence obtained in recent years in favour of\r\ninsect-pollination in certain Cycads and in _Welwitschia_ lends support\r\nto this view: the dragon flies hovering over a fertile _Lyginopteris_\r\nfrond in a recent restoration[154] may be a legitimate addition.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of _Lagenostoma_ as of other Palaeozoic seeds is\r\nthe absence of an embryo: this and other considerations have led\r\ncertain authors, notably Chodat[155], to question the justification\r\nfor the use of the term seed. Various suggestions have been offered in\r\nexplanation of this fact. In recent Cycads, as already pointed out, the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo does not always occur before seed-fall. It\r\nmay be that these older seeds had no resting-period or there may have\r\nbeen a period of rest after fertilisation and not as now at a stage\r\nsubsequent to the formation of the embryo[156]; it is also suggested\r\nby Scott that ‘the nursing of the embryo had not yet come to be one of\r\nthe functions of the seed, and that the whole embryonic development was\r\nrelegated to the germination stage[157].’ In this connexion reference\r\nmay be made to a statement by Miss Gibbs[158] who speaks of seeds of\r\na _Podocarpus_ picked up from the ground in apparently a mature state\r\nand with the associated bracts coloured and swollen as though ready\r\nto aid in dispersal but with no embryo: the seeds had matured before\r\nfertilisation and fell from the tree after pollination. Whatever\r\nmay be the true explanation of the absence of embryos this negative\r\ncharacter should not be allowed to outweigh the evidence furnished\r\nby morphological features as to the applicability of the term seed.\r\nAs Prof. Oliver says, ‘there is a long chapter in evolution to be\r\ndeciphered before we can connect ... the seed of _Lyginodendron_ with\r\nthe sporangium of any fern at present known to us’[159].\r\n\r\nThe cupule of _Lagenostoma_ has been homologised with the outer\r\npart of the integument of a recent cycadean seed[160] which, it is\r\nsuggested, consists of an inner and an outer envelope that have become\r\nconcrescent, and this hypothesis is supported by another author by a\r\ncomparison between _Lagenostoma_ and Gnetalean seeds[161]. A comparison\r\nhas also been made between the collar of a _Ginkgo_ seed and the much\r\nmore conspicuous cupule of _Lagenostoma_[162]. Dr Benson and Miss\r\nWelsford[163] institute a comparison between the vascular supply of the\r\nouter integument of the ovules of _Carpinus_ and _Morus_ and that of\r\nthe cupule of _Lagenostoma_, a comparison suggested by Miss Kershaw’s\r\nremarks[164] on the similarity between the vascular system of the\r\novules of _Myrica Gale_ and _Trigonocarpus_. In 1908 Dr Benson[165]\r\ndescribed some germinating microspores in the pollen-chamber of another\r\nspecies of _Lagenostoma_, _L. ovoides_, and recognised what she\r\nbelieved to be antherozoids. I am indebted to this author for allowing\r\nme to make a drawing from her section (fig. 408, D). Two microspores\r\nare seen with thick outer walls showing irregular holes probably of\r\nsecondary origin and not part of a regular reticulum as Dr Benson\r\nsuggests. Close to the upper microspore is a hemispherical body, _s_,\r\ndescribed as a male gamete, and a similar body is seen still enclosed\r\nby the lower microspore. It is by no means improbable that these are\r\nantherozoids: they were presumably ciliate like those of _Ginkgo_ and\r\nrecent Cycads (fig. 396, M). The microspores are approximately 70μ in\r\nlength and the supposed antherozoids have a maximum diameter of 45μ,\r\nthe latter being about ⅔ the size of the sperms of _Microcycas_ and ⅙\r\nthe diameter of those of _Zamia_. The smaller and more delicate cells\r\nnear the lower microspore (fig. 408, D) are no doubt fungal cells as\r\nMiss Benson suggests. With reference to the difficulty of determining\r\nthe nature of Miss Benson’s supposed gametes it is worth calling\r\nattention to some figures given by Zopf[166] of vesicular cells and\r\nsporangia of the Phycomycetous genera _Rhizophidium_ and _Lagenidium_\r\nin the pollen of Flowering plants and Pines. It has been suggested by\r\nBurlingame[167] that the ‘gametes’ may be prothallial cells; but this\r\nis very improbable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lagenostoma ovoides_ Williamson.\r\n\r\nIn the memoir in which the genus was founded Williamson described\r\ntwo species from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire, _Lagenostoma\r\novoides_ and _L. physoides_[168]. The seeds described under the\r\nlatter name had previously been assigned by him to another new genus,\r\n_Physostoma_, and named _P. elegans_[169]. _Lagenostoma physoides_\r\nwas afterwards figured by Butterworth[170] who recognised some new\r\nfeatures. For this species Prof. Oliver[171] has adopted Williamson’s\r\nearlier name, _Physostoma elegans_. The former species, which has\r\nrecently received exhaustive treatment by Miss Prankerd[172], agrees\r\ngenerally in its morphological characters with _L. Lomaxi_, but\r\ndiffers in the structure of the surface-tissue of the integument and\r\nin some anatomical features. Moreover no cupules have been found and\r\nthere is ‘very little trace of a layer of separation’ such as occurs\r\nin _L. Lomaxi_. Over the surface of the integument is a layer of\r\nprismatic cells, much shorter and less palisade-like than those in _L.\r\nLomaxi_, and there are none of the pegs which are a constant feature\r\nin that species. There are, however, indications that mucilage was\r\npoured out by the rupture of the distended cells. Some microspores\r\nwere found in the pollen-chamber with an average size of 72 × 53μ;\r\nthey may be as much as 90μ long. None were observed with sperm-like\r\ncontents like those described by Dr Benson. Miss Prankerd discusses\r\nthe morphology of the integument in relation to that of cycadean seeds\r\nand makes an instructive comparison between the lagenostome (that\r\nis the modified nucellar apex) and such fern sporangia as those of\r\n_Angiopteris_, _Osmunda_, and _Schizaea_, but especially the sporangia\r\nof _Senftenbergia_[173] with their multiseriate annulus.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature is shown in the longitudinal section reproduced\r\nin fig. 493, A (p. 311). The apex of the nucellar cone appears to be\r\ncomposed of thick-walled, dark cells and it is suggested that this\r\nmay have served as a stopper blocking up the circular orifice of the\r\npollen-chamber (seen below the apex between the nucellar cone and the\r\nthick surface-layer of the nucellus) and serving as a protection to the\r\nembryo. A comparable closing-up of the micropyle occurs in the seeds of\r\n_Gnetum Gnemon_[174] and in the beak of cycadean seeds. At the time of\r\npollination, when the pollen-chamber must have extended to the apex of\r\nthe lagenostome, the tip of the nucellar cone may have secreted some\r\nsticky substance to which the microspores would adhere.\r\n\r\nProf. Lignier[175] has recently described some large megasporangia\r\nfrom the Westphalian Coalfield of Ostrau in Austrian Silesia which he\r\nmade the type of a new genus _Mittagia_, after Herr Mittag, Director\r\nof Mines. Two sporangia, between 2 and 3 mm. in diameter, were found\r\nin close association as though belonging to a single sorus; one was\r\nempty and the other contained four megaspores. The structure of the\r\nthick wall of the sporangia is very similar to that of the testa\r\nof _Lagenostoma Lomaxi_, but it apparently split into two valves.\r\nLignier refers the new type, _Mittagia seminiformis_, to some\r\nunknown Palaeozoic group of heterosporous Filicineae, possibly the\r\nancestral stock of the Pteridosperms, and he thinks it probable that\r\nthe sporangia resembled seeds in their facilities for dispersal. In\r\nthe structure of the sporangial wall _Mittagia_ also resembles the\r\nsporocarp of _Pilularia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Seeds presented as impressions, without internal structure,\r\n                superficially resembling Lagenostoma._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lagenospermum_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis generic name is adopted for seeds represented by casts or\r\nimpressions agreeing in external features with _Lagenostoma_ but\r\nwhich on the available evidence cannot be confidently assigned to\r\nthat genus[176]. Two types of seed were described by Arber[177]\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Scotland as _Lagenostoma Kidstoni_\r\nand _L. Sinclairi_: the former has been removed by Oliver[178] to\r\n_Physostoma_ and both are included by Arber[179] in a recent paper in\r\nthe genus _Radiospermum_. This new generic term is proposed by Arber\r\nfor a number of small sub-cylindrical seeds founded on impressions\r\nincluding ‘small seeds which, when the structure is preserved,\r\nare known as _Lagenostoma_, _Physostoma_, and _Conostoma_.’ The\r\nquestion of nomenclature is invariably raised by cases in which\r\nimpressions resemble in their superficial characters genera founded on\r\nanatomical characters: the seeds originally referred to _Lagenostoma\r\nSinclairi_ afford a good example of this difficulty. Nathorst has\r\nrecently proposed the generic name _Lagenospermum_ as preferable\r\nto _Lagenostoma_ and _Radiospermum_ in the case of _Lagenostoma\r\nSinclairi_ and similar seeds which afford no proof of the possession\r\nof such morphological characters as would justify their inclusion in\r\nthe genus _Lagenostoma_ but which may be examples of that genus. As\r\nNathorst points out, the adoption of _Radiospermum_ for _L. Sinclairi_\r\nis inadvisable on the ground that it is also applied to seeds of a\r\ndifferent type. The type-species of _Lagenospermum_ is _L. Sinclairi_\r\nand Nathorst describes additional species from Lower Carboniferous\r\nrocks in Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lagenospermum Sinclairi_ (Arber ex Kidston +MS.+).\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not certain that these seeds are morphologically\r\nidentical with the genus _Lagenostoma_, a brief description is\r\nintercalated here as the habit of the seed-bearing axes supplies a\r\nprobable key to the habit of the fertile fronds of _Lyginopteris_.\r\nThe type-specimens were collected by Mr Sinclair from the Lower\r\nCoal Measures of Ayrshire, Scotland, and recorded by Kidston as\r\n_Lagenostoma_ sp.: they were afterwards named by him in manuscript\r\n_L. Sinclairi_ and handed to Dr Arber for description. The seeds are\r\nelliptical-oblong, 4–5·5 × 1·5–3 mm., radially symmetrical and enclosed\r\nby a loose envelope which is longitudinally ribbed and divided distally\r\ninto several linear-lanceolate lobes (fig. 408, A, A′). This covering,\r\nthough much longer than the cupule of _Lagenostoma Lomaxi_, is probably\r\na homologous structure. The most interesting point is the attachment\r\nof the seeds to slender branches of a compound axis (fig. 408, A). It\r\nis probable that the seeds were borne on a frond characterised by the\r\nreduction or complete abortion of the sterile lamina or perhaps, as\r\nin the recent Fern _Thyrsopteris elegans_[180], some of the pinnae of\r\na large compound frond were fertile. It is worthy of note that Arber\r\nrecognised pinnules of _Sphenopteris obtusiloba_[181] in association\r\nwith _L. Sinclairi_, a fact, as he says, in itself of no value but\r\nwhich acquires significance in view of the discovery by Carpentier[182]\r\nof cupules in close proximity to the same species of frond. Specimens\r\ndescribed by Dr Stopes from Westphalian rocks of New Brunswick as\r\n_Pterispermostrobus bifurcatus_[183] bear a close resemblance to _L.\r\nSinclairi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lagenospermum oblongum_ (Kidston).\r\n\r\nThe species recently described by Dr Kidston[184] as _Lagenostoma\r\noblonga_ from the South Staffordshire coal-field appears to be closely\r\nallied to Arber’s _L. Sinclairi_: it is represented by pairs of seeds\r\nborne at the ends of forked branchlets: the seed is 2·5 mm. long by 1·5\r\nmm. broad and is surrounded by a longer oblong cupule divided distally\r\ninto 6 free lobes.\r\n\r\nA larger type of seed, 3 cm. long and 2·5 cm. broad, is described by\r\nKidston[185] from the same coal-field as _Lagenostoma? urceolaris_. A\r\ncharacteristic feature is the truncate apex surrounded by a prominent\r\ncanopy formed of the expanded apical free portion of the integument.\r\nThe lack of anatomical data in both these seeds is a reason for the\r\nsubstitution of some less committal term than _Lagenostoma_.\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[186] and Carpentier[187] have published accounts of\r\nimpressions of seeds from the Coal Measures of France compared by them\r\nwith species of _Lagenostoma_ though not assigned to new species.\r\nThese and similar seeds should be referred to Nathorst’s genus\r\n_Lagenospermum_.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of recognising the true nature of seed-like impressions\r\nis illustrated by some specimens in the Goldenberg collection in\r\nStockholm described by Arber[188] as _Carpolithus Nathorsti_: these\r\nconsist of pieces of _Sphenopteris_ pinnae probably, as Zeiller\r\nsuggested, _Sphenopteris Schaumburg-Lippeana_ (Stur) bearing at\r\nthe ends of the segments of deeply divided pinnules what appeared\r\nto be seeds 1 mm. long, oval and longitudinally ribbed, and\r\npossibly enclosed in a cupule. Arber considered the ‘seeds’ to be\r\nrelated to _Lagenostoma_, probably belonging to some member of the\r\nLyginopterideae. An examination of the specimens by Nathorst[189]\r\nshowed that the supposed seeds are collections of spores; but whether\r\nthe spores of a true Fern or the microspores of a Pteridosperm cannot\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterispermostrobus_ Stopes.\r\n\r\n_Pterispermostrobus bifurcatus_ Stopes.\r\n\r\nDr Stopes[190] has recently called attention to a resemblance between\r\nspecimens from the Westphalian of New Brunswick, described by her as\r\n_Pterispermostrobus bifurcatus_, and _Lagenospermum Sinclairi_. The New\r\nBrunswick fossil is made the type of a new genus _Pterispermostrobus_,\r\nwhich is employed for fructifications of Pteridosperms that cannot\r\nbe associated with a known species of parent and may be either seeds\r\nor complex male organs borne on a definitely branched rachis. The\r\ntype-species is represented by a slender axis bearing lateral branches\r\ndivided into two widely divergent arms each of which bears a terminal\r\nbody, 4 × 3 mm., characterised by 3–5 apical lobes extending 2 mm.\r\nbeyond the distal end of the seed-like organ and resembling a cupule.\r\nIn this as in many other cases it is impossible to determine the\r\ntrue nature of the reproductive bodies, whether they are small seeds\r\nor groups of microsporangia: the new generic name serves a useful\r\npurpose though it is not always possible definitely to refer doubtful\r\nfructifications of this kind to a Pteridosperm. The organs in question\r\nmay also be compared with _Codonotheca_[191].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterispermostrobus pusillus_ (Nathorst).\r\n\r\nThe name, _Codonotheca pusilla_, is given by Nathorst[192] to some\r\ndoubtful specimens from the Culm of Spitzbergen representing short\r\nstalks bearing linear-lanceolate scale-like bodies, 9–10 mm. long\r\nby 1 mm. broad, coalescent at the base. Nathorst compares them\r\nwith Sellard’s species, _Codonotheca caduca_, but adds that they\r\nmay be cupules of some Pteridosperm and calls attention to their\r\nresemblance to some fossils figured by Carpentier as _Calymmatotheca\r\nacuta_. Both Nathorst’s species and the French specimens described\r\nby Carpentier[193] as cupules may be referred to Dr Stopes’ genus\r\n_Pterispermostrobus_ as their morphological nature cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n+v.+ _Roots._\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Williamson[194] described some petrified vegetative organs\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire under the name _Kaloxylon\r\nHookeri_ characterised by a division of the secondary xylem into\r\ncuneate masses (fig. 415, C) like those in some recent Bignoniaceous\r\nstems. Williamson at first believed _Kaloxylon_ to be a stem, but in a\r\nlater memoir he expressed the opinion that ‘it is difficult to believe\r\nthat these organs have been other than roots’[195]. Felix[196] had\r\nmeanwhile described a specimen from the Coal Measures of Westphalia as\r\n_Kaloxylon cf. Hookeri_ and suggested that it might be a waterplant. In\r\n1894 Williamson and Scott[197] demonstrated that _Kaloxylon Hookeri_\r\nis the root of _Lyginopteris_, a conclusion independently reached by\r\nHick[198].\r\n\r\nThe roots of _Lyginopteris_ arise on all sides of the radially\r\nsymmetrical stem in the pericycle region; they are copiously\r\nbranched as is shown by the abundance of roots of various sizes in\r\nclose association. No roots have been discovered exceeding 1 cm. in\r\ndiameter nor have any been recorded with secondary periderm-tissue.\r\nThe absence of root-hairs and the more or less lacunar structure of\r\nthe cortex are indicative of swampy ground. It is seldom that the\r\npalaeobotanist has an opportunity of investigating the growing-points\r\nof Palaeozoic plants, and for this reason some well-preserved apices\r\nof _Lyginopteris_ roots, attributed to that genus on the ground\r\nof constant association with fragments of stems in the calcareous\r\nnodules of Dulesgate, are of special interest. One of these specimens\r\nwas figured by Dr Stopes and Mr Watson[199] in their account of\r\nplant-bearing nodules, and a description of that and other examples has\r\nsince been published by Prof. Weiss[200]. A longitudinal section of a\r\nroot-tip, ·21 mm. in diameter at its broadest part, shows a root-cap\r\nwhich suggests an origin from a single cell, but an examination of\r\nthe plerome-cylinder in a slightly tangential section does not afford\r\nconclusive evidence of the occurrence of a single initial cell. Weiss\r\non the whole inclines to the view that _Lyginopteris_ possessed a\r\nsingle apical cell like the roots of Leptosporangiate Ferns, though he\r\nprefers to leave the decision open. Attention is drawn to the fact that\r\nthe plate of tracheidal tissue in emerging lateral rootlets is vertical\r\nas in Phanerogams and not horizontal as in recent Pteridophyta.\r\n\r\nThe vascular tissue of a _Lyginopteris_ root (fig. 410) consists of\r\nfrom three to eight alternate strands of centripetal xylem and phloem,\r\nand with the metaxylem is associated a small amount of conjunctive\r\nparenchyma which does not form a central pith. The pericycle, one to\r\nseveral layers broad, is succeeded by an endodermis which occasionally\r\nshows the characteristic thickenings on the radial walls. A broad\r\ncortex of thin-walled lacunar tissue with numerous secretory cells is\r\nbounded externally by a superficial cylinder of two or more layers\r\nof comparatively large and thin cells, the outermost of which are\r\nradially elongated. This superficial tissue forms a striking feature\r\nby which a _Lyginopteris_ root may often be recognised at a glance.\r\nThe root represented in fig. 410, approximately 2 mm. in diameter, has\r\na heptarch stele divided into seven xylem-groups by crushed bands of\r\nparenchyma and a protoxylem strand occupies the apex of each projecting\r\nangle (fig. 410, _px_). The superficial cylinder of clear cells is seen\r\nat _a_. A very small root is seen at _r_ in fig. 410.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410. _Lyginopteris oldhamia_, young root. × 30.\r\n(Kidston Coll. 403.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 415, C, represents part of an older root in which the pentarch\r\nprimary xylem is enclosed by broad wedge-like groups of secondary\r\nxylem and phloem separated by conspicuous medullary rays opposite the\r\nprotoxylem strands (_px_). Crushed primary phloem arcs, _p_, are often\r\nclearly recognisable beyond the cambium. The secondary thickening,\r\nas Williamson and Scott state, ‘takes place exactly in the manner\r\ntypical of roots of Dicotyledons, so that this fossil might very well\r\nbe used for purposes of demonstration as illustrating the secondary\r\ngrowth of a root with diagrammatic clearness’[201]. The young roots\r\nof _Lyginopteris_ resemble in many respects those of Marattiaceous\r\nFerns, though the presence of a single apical cell, if such occurs, is\r\na distinguishing feature; but in the presence of secondary conducting\r\ntissue they agree with those of Phanerogams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Lyginopteris._\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which petrified fragments of _Lyginopteris_\r\nstems occur in the calcareous nodules of the English coal seams\r\nshows that the genus must have been plentifully represented in the\r\nUpper Carboniferous vegetation, and the occurrence in both North\r\nAmerican[202] and European localities of fronds identical with or\r\nclosely resembling _Sphenopteris Hoeninghausi_ affords evidence of wide\r\ngeographical range. Petrified specimens were recorded by Felix[203]\r\nfrom Westphalia in 1886, and Zalessky[204] has recently discovered\r\n_Lyginopteris_ in the Donetz coal-basin of Russia. An investigation\r\nby Kubart[205] of the calcareous nodules, to which attention was\r\nfirst drawn by Stur, in the Ostrau Coal Measures led to the discovery\r\nof several examples of _Lyginopteris_ stems. The descriptions and\r\nfigures so far published are hardly sufficient to enable us to\r\nestimate the degree of relationship to the English type, but some of\r\nthe stems appear to be new species and Kubart considers them all to\r\nbe specifically distinct from _Lyginopteris oldhamia_. _Lyginopteris\r\nheterangioides_ contains scattered tracheids in the pith and thus\r\naffords an interesting transitional type between _Lyginopteris_ and\r\n_Heterangium_. In _L. lacunosum_ the inner cortex is lacunar and\r\nthe primary xylem bundles pursue an independent course in the stele\r\nin contrast to the anastomosing arrangement in _L. oldhamia_ and in\r\nanother Hungarian species _L. tristichum_. The species recorded by\r\nKubart occur in the Millstone grit and the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe geological range of _Lyginopteris_ as represented by petrified\r\nstems does not extend beyond the limits of the Carboniferous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HETERANGIUM.=\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Heterangium_ was first used by Corda[206] for a\r\npiece of stem from the Coal Measures of Radnitz, Bohemia, represented\r\nby part of the vascular axis of a stem consisting of strands of\r\nlarge reticulately pitted tracheids intermixed with parenchyma and\r\nexhibiting structural features differing apparently from those of any\r\nknown type. Corda’s material has been re-examined by Kubart[207] who\r\nfigures a section from it. _Heterangium_ is a genus closely allied to\r\n_Lyginopteris_ both in habit and in general anatomical characters. The\r\nstem is monostelic; the vascular cylinder prior to secondary thickening\r\nresembles the protostele of certain recent species of _Gleichenia_ and\r\nmay be compared also with _Trichomanes scandens_[208]. It agrees with\r\nthat of _Lyginopteris_ in the possession of primary mesarch bundles\r\nbut differs in the substitution of a cauline axial mass of metaxylem\r\nfor the pith of _Lyginopteris_. The secondary vascular tissue agrees\r\nclosely with that of recent Cycads and _Lyginopteris_. A characteristic\r\nfeature is the occurrence of numerous horizontal bands of sclerous\r\ncells in the cortex (fig. 412) of the stem and in the ground-tissue of\r\nthe rachis and larger branches of the fronds. The stem was erect and\r\nrarely branched ‘giving off large foliar appendages at somewhat distant\r\nintervals and from its entire circumference’[209]. Our knowledge of the\r\nreproductive organs is less precise than in the case of _Lyginopteris_;\r\nbut we are justified in asserting that _Heterangium_ is a Pteridosperm\r\nwhich in all probability bore fern-like microsporangia and seeds\r\nsimilar in general plan to _Lagenostoma_.\r\n\r\nThe association of some seeds included in Williamson’s genus\r\n_Conostoma_ with _Heterangium Grievii_ in the Pettycur beds and their\r\nresemblance to _Lagenostoma_, the seed of _Lyginopteris_, suggested\r\nthe possibility of actual connexion: further evidence in support of\r\nthis view has recently been brought forward by Dr Benson[210] in the\r\ncase of a species of _Conostoma_ which she transfers to a new genus\r\n_Sphaerostoma_.\r\n\r\nThe two species _Heterangium Grievii_ and _H. tiliaeoides_ are\r\ndescribed in illustration of the genus and reference is made to a few\r\nother types.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heterangium Grievii_ Williamson.\r\n\r\n  (_Stem_.)\r\n\r\n1872. _Dictyoxylon Grievii_, Williamson, Brit.

One of these was named _D.\r\nGrievii_ after Mr Grieve the discoverer of the specimens. In a later\r\nand more complete description Williamson adopted Corda’s generic name\r\non the ground of the close resemblance of the Scotch stem to the\r\nBohemian fragment _Heterangium paradoxum_. In 1873[212] Williamson\r\nadded new facts in regard to _H. Grievii_ and in 1890[213] he described\r\na very closely allied type from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire.\r\nFive years later his descriptions were considerably extended and\r\nmodified in the joint memoir with Dr Scott[214].\r\n\r\nThe great difference in age between the English Upper Carboniferous\r\nstem and the Scotch specimens from the Lower Carboniferous beds of\r\nBurntisland suggests a probable specific difference. Dr Scott has\r\nrecently adopted the name _Heterangium Lomaxi_, proposed but not\r\npublished by Williamson, for the English type. Though in the following\r\naccount the species _Heterangium Grievii_ is treated in the broader\r\nsense it should be recognised that the geologically younger stem\r\nis worthy of specific recognition; it is characterised, to quote\r\nScott[215], by ‘the great distinctness of the primary xylem strands,\r\nby their nearly exarch structure, with little primary centrifugal\r\nwood, by the abundant secretory sacs of the stele, and by the rather\r\nscattered leaves.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411. _Heterangium Grievii_. _lt_, _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\nleaf-traces; _p_, pericycle with periderm; _ph_, phloem; _x_¹, _x_²,\r\nprimary and secondary xylem; _px_, protoxylem; _r_, root; _s_, sclerous\r\ntissue.]\r\n\r\n_Heterangium Grievii_ has a radially symmetrical stem bearing compound\r\nleaves with decurrent petioles which give to the otherwise cylindrical\r\naxis an angular outline as seen in transverse section (fig. 411, A).\r\nThe phyllotaxis appears to be ⅜. The stem rarely exceeds 1·5 cm. in\r\ndiameter: in the centre is a comparatively large stele consisting in\r\nyoung stems of primary xylem and phloem, but in older stems these\r\nare separated by a cylinder of secondary vascular tissue which in\r\nthis species is always narrower than in _Lyginopteris oldhamia_ and,\r\nas Williamson pointed out, often of unequal thickness on different\r\nradii. The medullated stele of _Lyginopteris_ is replaced by a solid\r\nxylem-cylinder consisting mainly of groups of large tracheids, reaching\r\n·3 mm. in diameter, with multiseriate bordered pits (fig. 411, D)\r\nembedded in an anastomosing parenchymatous tissue-system. In the stele\r\nreproduced in fig. 411, B, which with the exception of a very narrow\r\nzone of secondary xylem, _x_², consists entirely of primary xylem,\r\n_x_¹, the parenchyma is represented by a darker reticulum (_cf._ fig.\r\n415, B) dividing the metaxylem into islands as in _Gleichenia_. In\r\nthe peripheral portion of the xylem the tracheids are rather narrower\r\nand arranged in more definite groups in many of which is a single\r\nstrand of narrow spiral elements (fig. 411, A′, _px_) close to the\r\nouter margin. These peripheral primary bundles in which protoxylem\r\nis recognisable may be described as leaf-traces of mesarch structure\r\nconsisting of centripetal xylem and, to a much less extent, of smaller\r\ncentrifugal elements for the most part with dense spiral bands in place\r\nof the multiseriate pits of the rest of the metaxylem. The structure\r\nof these leaf-traces is practically identical with that of the primary\r\nbundles of _Lyginopteris_. There is, however, a difference to which\r\nattention is drawn by Williamson and Scott. While in _Lyginopteris_ in\r\nany transverse section the primary bundles in the stele are equal in\r\nnumber to the leaf-traces in the pericycle and cortex, in _Heterangium_\r\nthe peripheral groups in the stele may be as many as twenty, a number\r\nconsiderably in excess of the leaf-traces beyond the limits of the\r\nprimary xylem of the stele. It may be that the leaf-trace of each\r\nleaf, which joins the stele at a distance of 6–10 internodes below\r\nits entrance into the cortex from the leaf-stalk, may branch in its\r\ndescent in the axial region, or some of the primary groups of xylem may\r\nbe confined to the axial region and independent of the leaf-traces.\r\nPortions of the peripheral region of the stele may be occupied by\r\nmetaxylem groups without protoxylem and identical with those which make\r\nup the bulk of the metaxylem.\r\n\r\nScott[216] has recently published a note in which he states that most\r\nof the British Coal Measures Heterangiums were polydesmic. Two bundles,\r\nand not a single strand as in the Scotch _H. Grievii_, leave the stele\r\nfor each leaf, and these divide into four, in some cases at least,\r\nbefore entering the petiole.\r\n\r\nThe secondary xylem is continuous at its inner edge with the outermost\r\nprimary tracheids (fig. 411, A′) and consists of rows of tracheids,\r\n1–3 elements broad, alternating with numerous broad medullary rays\r\nof radially elongated parenchyma. Beyond a typical cambium-zone the\r\nsecondary phloem consists of parenchyma and sieve-tubes bounded by\r\ncrushed arcs of primary phloem. Abutting on the phloem is a pericycle\r\ncomposed of several layers of small parenchymatous cells (fig. 411,\r\nA, _p_) and in the outer layers of this tissue a phellogen (fig. 411,\r\nC, _p_) and some periderm are usually present though, as Williamson\r\nand Scott point out, the periderm is less regular and narrower than\r\nin _Lyginopteris_. The inner cortex, composed of short parenchymatous\r\ncells, is traversed by numerous narrow bands of dark, thick-walled\r\ncells similar in the structure of the elements, though peculiar in\r\nthe horizontal elongation of the groups, to the sclerous nests in the\r\npericycle and pith of _Lyginopteris_. These characteristic bands are\r\nchiefly seen in the oblique longitudinal section of a stem represented\r\nin fig. 412. In this section, 25 mm. in length, the lighter band, _p_,\r\nis the pericycle and in it a few obliquely cut leaf-traces are shown as\r\ndark patches. The horizontal bands are similar in structure and shape\r\nto the diaphragms of thick cells in the pith of _Abies magnifica_[217],\r\nand in both plants they probably serve as supports to the softer\r\nparenchyma. There may be as many as 46 bands in a vertical length of\r\ncortex of 1 inch (about 19 per centimetre). It was the occurrence of\r\nprecisely similar transverse lines on the carbonised impressions of the\r\nrachis of _Sphenopteris elegans_ that led Kidston[218] to suggest a\r\nconnexion between that species and the stem of _Heterangium Grievii_.\r\n\r\nThe outer cortex, consisting of alternate strands of parenchyma and\r\nstereome similar to that of _Lyginopteris_, is much narrower and a less\r\nconspicuous feature than in _Heterangium_; the stereome bands do not\r\nform so regular a hypodermal network and extend much further vertically\r\nwithout anastomosing. The epidermis has been described as a layer of\r\nfairly thick cells showing in one case an appearance of a depressed\r\nstoma[219]. There are no secretory canals like those of Cycads but,\r\nas in _Lyginopteris_, scattered cells with dark contents in the\r\nstem-tissues probably represent secretory sacs.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-traces on leaving the stele pursue a very gradually ascending\r\ncourse to the petiole; they retain their collateral structure in the\r\npericycle and cortex and have no secondary xylem, but become concentric\r\nas they enter the base of a leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412. _Heterangium Grievii_. Oblique longitudinal\r\nsection of stele and part of cortex; _p_, pericycle. × 3. (Kidston\r\nColl. 529.)]\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the description of the leaves, the more striking\r\nfeatures in the stem may be summarised with reference to the\r\ndiagrammatic sketches shown in fig. 411. Fig. 411, A, represents a\r\nsection of _Heterangium Grievii_ approximately 2 cm. in its maximum\r\ndiameter; at the periphery of the primary xylem, _x_¹, and close to its\r\nouter margin are several protoxylem groups, not shown in the drawing,\r\neach of which marks the position of a mesarch trace. The zone of\r\nsecondary xylem, _x_², is interrupted by the exit of leaf-traces and\r\none of these is seen at _a_ in fig. 415, A, separated from the central\r\nprimary xylem by a foliar gap filled with parenchyma. The pericycle\r\nis shown at _p_ in fig. 412 and its outer boundary at _p_ in fig.\r\n411, A. Beyond the pericycle is the broad parenchymatous cortex with\r\nleaf-traces, _lt_, and some sclerenchymatous patches, _s_. The vascular\r\nstrand _a_ is passing into the base of a leaf-stalk. In the stem shown\r\nin fig. 411, B, 1·4 cm. × 7 mm., a decurrent petiole is seen at the\r\nupper end with its single vascular strand, _a_, and two sclerous nests;\r\na similar though detached leaf-base occurs at the opposite end of the\r\nlong diameter. Other leaf-traces are seen at _b_ and _c_. From the\r\nleft-hand side of the stele a curved strand of tracheids is passing out\r\nto supply a root, _r_.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Root_.\r\n\r\nAdventitious roots of endogenous origin are occasionally met with in\r\n_Heterangium_ stems, but we have less information as to their anatomy\r\nthan in the case of _Lyginopteris_. In a specimen of _Heterangium\r\nLomaxi_ figured by Williamson and Scott[220] three roots are seen in\r\na vertical series growing outwards through the cortex of a stem. The\r\nroots agree generally with those of _Lyginopteris_ but the outermost\r\ncortical layers possess no special features.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Leaf_.\r\n\r\nThe large compound fronds long known as _Sphenopteris elegans_\r\nwere recognised by Kidston as the leaves of _Heterangium_ by the\r\nclosely arranged transverse striae or narrow ribs on the rachis and\r\npinnae which are the expression on the carbonised impressions of\r\nthe horizontal plates of sclerous tissue in the petrified stems and\r\npetioles of _Heterangium_. The dichotomously branched fronds are\r\nincluded by Stur in his genus _Diplotmema_ and that author figures\r\nseveral typical examples in his ‘Culm Flora’[221]. Fig. 413, A,\r\nshows a forked axis with the bases of more slender branches and the\r\ncharacteristic transverse bands and in fig. 413, B, part of a pinna\r\nis reproduced. In general appearance, except in the bifurcating\r\npinnae, the fronds resemble those of _Davallia tenuifolia_ with which\r\nBrongniart compared the Palaeozoic species. There is little doubt\r\nthat _Sphenopteris dissecta_ and some other species were also borne\r\non _Heterangium_ stems. The rachis and petioles differ from those of\r\n_Lyginopteris_ fronds in the absence of emergences (_cf._ fig. 404,\r\nE). The petioles (fig. 411, B, _a_) have a single concentric vascular\r\nbundle with internal protoxylem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413. _Sphenopteris_ (_Diplotmema_) _elegans_.

There is a\r\nstrong _prima facie_ case for assigning the seed _Sphaerostoma_ to\r\n_Heterangium_: absolute proof of organic connexion is still lacking\r\nthough Dr Benson’s recent account of the seeds associated with\r\n_Heterangium Grievii_ almost amounts to demonstration of continuity\r\nbetween vegetative organs and seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sphaerostoma ovale_ (Williamson).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414. _Sphaerostoma ovale_. A. Longitudinal\r\nsection showing the cupule, _c_, integument, _e_, _f_, with vascular\r\nbundle, _v_, the upper part of the nucellus, _n_, and megaspore,\r\n_m_; _a_, archegonia. B. Transverse section through the roof of the\r\npollen-chamber, _pc_, and the summit of the nucellus, _n_. (After\r\nBenson.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Williamson described some detached petrified seeds from the\r\nLower Carboniferous rocks of Fifeshire, Scotland, as _Conostoma ovale_\r\nand _C. intermedium_. Dr Benson’s investigation[222] of these two\r\nforms leads her to confirm Williamson’s doubts as to the validity of a\r\nspecific separation and she assigns the single type to the new genus\r\n_Sphaerostoma_. The seeds are always associated with the vegetative\r\norgans of _Heterangium Grievii_. In 1909 Oliver[223] expressed the\r\nopinion that the Burntisland species of _Conostoma_ (= _Sphaerostoma_)\r\nis probably the seed of _Heterangium_. The seed consists of a central\r\nbody representing the nucellus, an inner integument, and an enveloping\r\ncupule or outer integument: most specimens have lost the cupule and in\r\nthis condition they are 3·5 mm. long with a maximum breadth of 2·2 mm.\r\nIn the middle the seed is circular in transverse section and octagonal\r\nnear the base and apex. The free apical part of the integument forms\r\na frill (canopy) round the micropyle and extends beyond the nucellar\r\napex which consists of a relatively flat plinth surmounted by a central\r\ndome or lagenostome (fig. 414). The lagenostome is surrounded by an\r\nannular pollen-chamber on to the lower surface of which abuts the\r\nlarge embryo-sac, and remains of archegonia were noticed below the\r\npollen-chamber. The roof of the chamber in the young state consists of\r\na layer of thin-walled cells extending across the flattened apex of\r\nthe nucellus, _n_, but as the pollen-chamber becomes differentiated\r\nfrom the nucellar tissue by the disorganisation of the zone of cells\r\nits roof-cells thicken their vertical walls and assume the structure\r\nof a multiseriate annulus, which acts as a mechanism for opening the\r\npollen-chamber by a circular dehiscence in such a way that the edge of\r\nthe ruptured roof of the pollen-chamber slightly overlaps the periphery\r\nof the central column of nucellar tissue after it has returned to its\r\noriginal position subsequent to the entrance of the microspores. The\r\nmicropylar region is surrounded by eight lobes of the integument and\r\neach is characterised by a crest of radially elongated cells, fig. 414,\r\n_f_, especially prominent on the outer side. External to this is the\r\nslightly longer cupular sheath (fig. 414, _c_) which may also have been\r\nlobed. The surface of the integument below the terminal crests consists\r\nof a layer of cells with small papillae which eventually ruptured and\r\ndischarged mucilage. Both integuments have a vascular supply, that of\r\nthe inner integument being represented by eight vascular bundles, some\r\nof which were found to have mesarch xylem, given off from the single\r\nstrand in the pedicel. Fig. 414 shows the apical region of a seed\r\nof _Sphaerostoma_: the flat-topped nucellar cap, _n_, is surrounded\r\nby the annular pollen-chamber, _pc_, below which are indicated the\r\narchegonia: the wall of the megaspore (embryo-sac) is seen at _m_ and\r\nexternal to this vascular bundles, _v_, run up the inner portion of\r\nthe integument accompanied by some large cells (aqueous tissue). The\r\nelongated epidermal cells at the apices of the lobes of the integument\r\nform the frill, _f_, and at a lower level the cells of the same layer\r\nare much smaller and papillate (_e_): the outer integument, _c_, forms\r\nthe so-called cupule. The transverse section shown in fig. 414, B,\r\nis taken at the level of the roof of the pollen-chamber and of the\r\nnucellar cap; it illustrates the contrast between the ‘multiseriate\r\nannulus’ and the central column of small parenchyma.\r\n\r\n_Sphaerostoma_ differs from _Lagenostoma_ in the whorl of crests around\r\nthe micropyle, in the nearly hemispherical form of the lagenostome\r\nand in the relatively wider pollen-chamber with its peculiar form of\r\ndehiscence. Miss Benson, while regarding _Sphaerostoma_ as similar to\r\n_Lagenostoma_ in general plan, believes the distinguishing features of\r\nthe former to be such as are consistent with a more primitive form.\r\n\r\nAn important argument in support of connecting this seed with\r\n_Heterangium_ is derived from the juxtaposition of some seeds and\r\nportions of _Heterangium_ petioles, a juxtaposition that is believed to\r\ndemonstrate original continuity.\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[224] has recorded the association of two species of leaves,\r\n_Sphenopteris elegans_ and _S. dissecta_, with small seeds compared by\r\nhim with _Lagenostoma_. In the absence of petrified specimens it would\r\nbe practically impossible to distinguish between _Lagenostoma_ and\r\n_Conostoma_ or _Sphaerostoma_.\r\n\r\nCarpentier[225] has described some impressions from French Westphalian\r\nbeds as _Conostoma_ and he records cupules without seeds on fronds of\r\n_Sphenopteris obtusifolia_ which he speaks of as having transverse\r\nstriations like those of _Heterangium_. Dr Kidston pointed out to me\r\nthat the surface-features of the _Sphenopteris_ rachis are probably\r\ndue to ramental scales and not to the presence of horizontal sclerous\r\nbands. Carpentier’s seeds may be compared with _Lagenospermum\r\nSinclairi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heterangium tiliaeoides_ Williamson, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Vol. 178, p.\r\n289.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded by Williamson on material from the Lower Coal\r\nMeasures of Halifax, Yorkshire, while agreeing in the structure of\r\nthe primary stele and in the general features of the cortex with the\r\nolder _Heterangium Grievii_, is clearly distinguished by certain\r\nwell-marked characters. Sclerous groups occur in the inner cortex as\r\nin _H. Grievii_ but they are present also in the pericycle. The\r\nperipheral leaf-traces in the stele show the mesarch structure rather\r\nmore distinctly than in _H. Grievii_, and the secondary xylem, which\r\nforms a much broader cylinder than in the Scotch type, is divided by\r\nbroad medullary rays into characteristic cuneate masses each of which\r\nrests at its base on the centrifugal tracheids of a leaf-trace strand\r\nof xylem (fig. 415, B). The most striking distinctive feature is\r\nafforded by the secondary phloem, which is often preserved in wonderful\r\nperfection; this is unusually thick and owing to the tangential\r\nexpansion of the principal medullary rays the secondary phloem is\r\ndivided into separate masses which decrease in breadth towards the\r\nexternal arcs of primary phloem. The triangular form of the phloem\r\nrays, composed of tangentially stretched parenchyma, suggested the\r\nspecific name _tiliaeoides_ on account of their striking resemblance\r\nto the rays of _Tilia_. The leaf-traces are nearly always in pairs as\r\nthey pass out through the cortex; they subsequently divide and appear\r\nas four vascular strands in the petiole. The portion of stem reproduced\r\nin fig. 415, _B_, 8 mm. broad, shows clearly the separation of the\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem into wedge-shaped groups: in each group\r\nthere are several narrow medullary rays. The extrastelar tissues are\r\nrepresented by a few fragments only. Several layers of crushed periderm\r\noccur in the pericyclic region but the more external tissues have been\r\nalmost completely exfoliated[226].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415. A, B, _Heterangium_. A, _H. Grievii_, _a_,\r\nleaf-traces. B, _H. tiliaeoides_. C, root of _Lyginopteris_.\r\n\r\n(A, B, Kidston Coll., 529, 294; C, Williamson Coll., 1631.)]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to _Heterangium Lomaxi_, the English\r\ntype originally included by Williamson in _Heterangium Grievii_. The\r\nprovisional species _Heterangium cylindricum_ Williamson and Scott[227]\r\ndiffers, as Scott says, in no important respect from _H. Lomaxi_ and\r\nshould not be retained. A new species, _H. minimum_ Scott[228], has\r\nbeen founded on a very small stem from the Coal Measures of Dulesgate\r\nin which the leaf-traces leave the stele as single bundles as in the\r\nScotch _H. Grievii_.\r\n\r\nThe French species _Heterangium Duchartrei_[229] Ren. from Permian\r\nrocks was originally referred by Renault to the genus _Poroxylon_: it\r\nis represented by little more than the xylem of the stele and bears\r\na close resemblance to _H. tiliaeoides_. _Heterangium punctatum_ Ren.\r\nand _H. Renaulti_[230] (Brongn.) also from the Permian of France were\r\noriginally placed in the genus _Lycopodium_ and afterwards recognised\r\nas stems of _Heterangium_. A fourth French Permian species, _H.\r\nbibractense_[231], is peculiar in the possession of a very small\r\nprimary stele encircled by deep wedges of secondary xylem, but without\r\nmore information it is impossible to speak with confidence as to\r\nits systematic position. Kubart[232] has recently published brief\r\ndescriptions of some stems from the Ostrauer coal-basin in Moravia all\r\nof which he regards as specifically distinct from the English types.\r\nIn _Heterangium Sturi_ the primary xylem is almost exarch and the\r\nperipheral xylem groups are not very clearly defined: in _H. alatum_,\r\nso called from the presence of lateral wings on the petioles, the\r\nleaf-trace strands are more sharply differentiated from the rest of\r\nthe stele. _H. polystichum_ is a similar type, and _H. Andrei_, with a\r\nrelatively larger amount of parenchyma in the stele and thicker stems\r\nforms an additional link between _Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_[233].\r\nProf. Johnson[234] has described a species of _Heterangium_, _H.\r\nhibernicum_, from Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous beds in Co.\r\nCork, Ireland, based on some impressions of frond fragments without any\r\npinnules. The occurrence of numerous transverse striae on the rachis\r\nand lateral branches suggests comparison with _Heterangium_ fronds,\r\nbut an examination of the specimens led me to suspect that some at\r\nleast of the striae are cracks and not original features. The presence\r\nof spur-like appendages from the lower surface of the pinnae near\r\ntheir origin from the rachis is recorded as a peculiar character, and\r\nsome obscure oval bodies, the nature of which is extremely doubtful,\r\nare considered to be seeds. The imperfection of the material hardly\r\njustifies the institution of a new species of _Heterangium_.\r\n\r\n_Heterangium_ ranges from the Lower Carboniferous to the Permian strata\r\nand is thus older than _Lyginopteris_ which in the form of petrified\r\nstems is not recorded from the Lower beds of the Carboniferous system.\r\n_Heterangium_ has been described as having a ‘great preponderance\r\nof fern-like characters,’ but having regard to the resemblance of\r\nthe primary xylem of the latter to that of the Osmundaceae it would\r\nseem doubtful whether in their relation to the Ferns there is any\r\nimportant difference. _Heterangium_ may safely be spoken of as the\r\nmore primitive genus. The polydesmic character of the petioles of most\r\nspecies is particularly interesting as it brings the genus nearer to\r\nthe Medulloseae and to _Rhetinangium_[235].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                           II. MEDULLOSEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Medulloseae was first employed by Goeppert and Stenzel[236]\r\nfor a family of Palaeozoic plants that appears to have reached its\r\nmaximum development in the Permian period: the oldest representatives\r\nso far discovered are of Upper Carboniferous age. Our knowledge of the\r\nfamily is chiefly derived from a study of the anatomical characters\r\nof stems, and it is therefore on this basis that any grouping of\r\ngenera or species should be attempted. Although there is little\r\ninformation with regard to the reproductive organs of _Medullosa_,\r\nthe type-genus, it is certain that the Medulloseae are Pteridosperms\r\ndiffering from members of that group included in the Lyginopterideae in\r\nthe presence of more than one stele in the stem, in the habit of the\r\nfronds, and in the structure of the rachis, as also in the structure\r\nof the seeds, though these organs bear a fairly close resemblance\r\nto the seeds of _Lyginopteris_ and _Heterangium_. The fronds of the\r\nLyginopterideae are of the _Sphenopteris_ type while in the case of\r\nsuch species of _Medullosa_ as afford evidence of connexion between\r\nstems and leaves the latter have the characters of _Neuropteris_,\r\n_Alethopteris_, _Odontopteris_, _Linopteris_, and other form-genera\r\nusually included in the Neuropterideae. Dr Lotsy[237] speaks of\r\n_Lyginopteris_ and _Heterangium_ as members of the Sphenopteridophylla\r\nand assigns species of _Medullosa_ either to the Neuropteridophylla\r\nor to the Pecopteridophylla, the latter subdivision including species\r\nwith fronds of the _Alethopteris_ type. There is, however, little\r\ndoubt that other forms of leaves, such as _Odontopteris_ and possibly\r\n_Taeniopteris_, were borne on Medullosan stems. It is undesirable\r\nexcept in the absence of more trustworthy criteria to make use of\r\nso protean a feature as leaf-form as a basis of classification. The\r\nname Neuropterideae has been frequently employed for Pteridosperms\r\nother than the Lyginopterideae on the ground that the foliage of\r\n_Medullosa_ is represented by species assigned to form-genera included\r\nin the Neuropterideae. It is, however, preferable to restrict the\r\nfamily-name Neuropterideae to fronds and to speak of the second family\r\nof Pteridosperms as the Medulloseae, including the genera _Medullosa_,\r\n_Sutcliffia_, and _Rhexoxylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MEDULLOSA.=\r\n\r\nSome species of _Medullosa_ probably resembled in habit _Angiopteris\r\nevecta_ and the larger Marattias; they had short and relatively thick\r\nstems clothed with the large decurrent bases of long compound fronds\r\nsuperficially like those of some recent Ferns and the leaves of the\r\nCycad _Bowenia_. It is probable that, as Zeiller[238] has pointed out,\r\nthe fronds of _Medullosa_ and of other Pteridosperms had a greater\r\ntendency than those of true Ferns to a dichotomy of the rachis. In\r\nother types the stems reached a considerable length and leaves and\r\nbranches were separated by several feet of bare stem. The large size\r\nof the leaf-stalks in proportion to the diameter of the stem as shown\r\nby such species as _Medullosa anglica_ and _M. Leuckarti_ (fig. 416)\r\nsuggests either a short and thick main axis or, in the case of long\r\nstems bearing scattered leaves, a plant that supported itself partially\r\nat least by a habit of growth comparable with that of tropical Aroids\r\nor other lianes. While _Medullosa anglica_ with its contiguous\r\nleaf-bases affords an example of the first type, the occurrence of\r\nstems of a Permian species, _M. stellata_, 3½ metres long without\r\nbranches or leaf-scars, suggests the habit of a liane; similarly a\r\nspecimen of _Medullosa Leuckarti_ in the Chemnitz Museum bearing a few\r\nspreading petioles but little narrower than the stem and given off at\r\na wide angle would seem to favour the view that some species were ill\r\nadapted to be mechanically self-supporting plants. The longest piece of\r\nstem that has come under my notice is a specimen of _M. stellata_ in\r\nthe Chemnitz Museum reaching a length of nearly 8 metres: some species\r\nattained a diameter of about 50 centimetres.\r\n\r\n_Medullosa_ is always polystelic: the plan of the vascular system\r\nvaries considerably as regards both the number and form of the steles,\r\nbut there is a uniform type of structure within the limits of each\r\nstele that recalls the single stele of _Heterangium_. The steles\r\nconsist of a central region composed of primary xylem, originally\r\nsurrounded by phloem, which in its mesarch or exarch structure agrees\r\nwith the vascular tissue of some species of _Gleichenia_ or _Lygodium_.\r\nTo this central region a cambium added secondary xylem and phloem\r\neither in the form of a cylinder of uniform breadth, or more frequently\r\nthe centrifugally developed xylem exceeded in amount the secondary\r\nconducting tissue added to the inner side of the primary region. Apart\r\nfrom anatomical details a Medullosan stem with its several steles,\r\neach with secondary tissue, embedded in parenchymatous ground-tissue\r\nresembles the stems of some Dicotyledonous climbers such as _Thinouia\r\nscandens_, species of _Serjania_ and _Paullinia_[239].\r\n\r\nAnatomically the main features of the stelar system of _Medullosa_,\r\nneglecting the secondary xylem and phloem, are in closer agreement\r\nwith the stems of Ferns than with those of any other plants. It has\r\nbeen shown that the genus _Heterangium_ bears a close resemblance to\r\n_Gleichenia_ in the structure of the primary stele (fig. 418, C): one\r\nof the oldest types of _Medullosa_, _M. anglica_, may be described\r\nas a _Heterangium_ with three steles and may be compared with a\r\ndictyostelic Fern in which the irregular vascular framework is made\r\nup of three main strands. In certain types of _Medullosa_ (fig. 416)\r\nthe ground-plan of the vascular system recalls that of a solenostelic\r\nFern, while in others the greater complexity suggests comparison with\r\nsuch Ferns as _Matonia_, _Angiopteris_, _Psaronius_, or _Cyathea_; ‘it\r\nis as though Nature were at the Carboniferous moment in the midst of a\r\nseries of amazing engineering experiments, most of which were either\r\nburied deep in Palaeozoic oblivion, or permitted to survive only as\r\nvestigial relics and atavistic ghosts’[240]. Though many Medullosae\r\nresemble Ferns there is an important difference between the two groups\r\nin the origin of the various plans of Medullosan stelar systems: in\r\nFerns the leaf is the determining factor in the evolution of stelar\r\narrangement, while in _Medullosa_ the occasional interruption of a\r\nsolenostele or the development of an apparently complex dictyostele are\r\nfeatures independent of the leaf and leaf-traces. In the structure of\r\nthe secondary xylem and phloem and in root-structure _Medullosa_ agrees\r\nwith recent Cycads. The genus is in short a generalised type with\r\nfilicinean and cycadean affinities. In the possession of seeds borne on\r\nmodified pinnae of compound fronds, _Medullosa_ resembles both _Cycas_\r\nand the Lyginopterideae. The seeds exhibit a fairly close agreement\r\nwith those of _Lyginopteris_, _Heterangium_ and recent Cycads, but\r\nthey appear to have advanced further towards the cycadean type than is\r\nthe case with the closely related seeds of the Lyginopterideae. The\r\nmicrosporophylls are very imperfectly known but they were undoubtedly\r\nmuch less advanced and more fern-like than the megasporophylls.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Medullosa_ is recorded from the Permian strata of Saxony,\r\nFrance, and Bohemia[241]; also from the Coal Measures of England, and\r\nthe discovery of petrified petioles of _Myeloxylon_, the type borne\r\non Medullosan stems in European species, may be taken as evidence of\r\nthe existence of the genus in North America during the Carboniferous\r\nperiod[242].\r\n\r\nThe name _Medullosa_ was applied by Cotta[243] to three types,\r\n_Medullosa elegans_, _M. stellata_, and _M. porosa_, from the\r\nRothliegende of the Chemnitz district. The first of these was\r\nrecognised by Brongniart[244] as a distinct genus for which he proposed\r\nthe designation _Myeloxylon_ and this was afterwards identified by\r\nRenault, Williamson, and other palaeobotanists as a petiole and not\r\na stem. Further reference is made to _Myeloxylon_ on a later page.\r\nCotta spoke of _Medullosa_ as the most puzzling of the genera dealt\r\nwith in his ‘Dendrolithen,’ and in spite of the many additions to our\r\nknowledge the position of this Palaeozoic genus is still a fertile\r\nsource of speculation. The generic designation _Medullosa_ is applied\r\nto stems, with or without petioles; petioles or rachises of fronds\r\nthat frequently occur apart from stems are referred to the genus\r\n_Myeloxylon_. The leaves of _Medullosa_ include several well-known\r\nspecies of Carboniferous and Permian genera such as _Alethopteris_,\r\n_Neuropteris_ and others that have in recent years been transferred\r\nfrom the Filicales to the Pteridosperms. In a few instances seeds\r\nhave been found in organic connexion with Medullosan foliage, and\r\nthere can be no reasonable doubt that _Trigonocarpus_, some forms\r\nof _Rhabdocarpus_, _Pachytesta_, and other seeds represent the\r\nintegumented megasporangia of _Medullosa_ or some closely allied genus.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to summarise the salient features of _Medullosa_ a\r\ndescription of a few selected types will serve to place us in a better\r\nposition to consider the genus as a whole. The British species are\r\nplaced first on the ground that they are both geologically the oldest\r\nthough, historically, the most recently described, representatives of\r\nthe genus; and in the organisation of the stem they are simpler than\r\nthe continental species. Their resemblance to _Heterangium_ serves\r\nto some extent to bridge the gap between the majority of species of\r\n_Medullosa_ and the simpler types of Pteridosperms represented by\r\n_Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa anglica_ Scott[245].\r\n\r\nPrior to the discovery of this species the genus _Medullosa_ had not\r\nbeen recorded from Britain. A section in the Williamson collection\r\nrecognised by Scott as that of a _Medullosa_ had been identified by\r\nWilliamson as a large _Heterangium_ stem. An undescribed specimen\r\nwas found by Arber[246] in the Binney collection at Cambridge which\r\nafforded some additional information as to the structure of the roots.\r\n\r\nThe specimens on which Scott’s thorough description is based were\r\nobtained by Messrs Wilde and Lomax from the Lower Coal Measures\r\nof Lancashire. The stem of this oldest species has the habit of a\r\ntree-fern and is almost completely invested by the stout decurrent\r\nbases of the petioles of large spirally disposed compound fronds with\r\na phyllotaxis of ⅖, the leaves of the same orthostichy being separated\r\nfrom one another by a vertical distance of approximately 10 cm.\r\n\r\nA transverse section of a slightly flattened stem is shown in fig.\r\n416, A, the bases of three petioles give to it an angular form. Its\r\ndimensions are approximately 10 × 4 cm. The ground-tissue of two of\r\nthe petioles is continuous with that of the stem, while that of the\r\nthird leaf-stalk is cut through near its separation from the stem and\r\nits adaxial face is already defined by a hypodermal band of stereome,\r\n_d_. The surface of the stem is characterised by fine longitudinal\r\nribs caused by the slightly projecting stereome in the outer cortex,\r\nand from the narrow furrows between the leaf-bases adventitious roots\r\nemerge in vertical series. The position of an interfoliar furrow is\r\nshown by a small arrow in fig. 416, A. There are three steles, 2–3\r\ncm. × 6–10 mm. in diameter: each agrees very closely in structure\r\nwith the single stele of _Heterangium_. _Medullosa anglica_ may be\r\ndescribed as a polystelic _Heterangium_ and as having the same relation\r\nto _Heterangium_ as regards the stelar system as _Primula auricula_\r\nbears to the monostelic _Primula_. The central core of the stele (the\r\nblack patches in the diagram, fig. 416, A) consists of an anastomosing\r\nsystem of tracheal groups embedded in an irregular parenchymatous\r\nreticulum. The large primary tracheids reach a diameter of 150μ and\r\nhave multiseriate pitting: at the periphery of the primary xylem there\r\nis a more definite grouping of tracheids as in _Heterangium_, and the\r\nslightly internal (mesarch) protoxylem elements are associated with\r\nscalariform and densely spiral tracheids (fig. 416, B, C) narrower than\r\nthe more internal reticulate elements. The secondary xylem is manoxylic\r\nas in Cycads, tracheids in 2–4 radial series alternating with medullary\r\nrays 1–3 cells broad and usually of considerable depth (fig. 416, B).\r\nThe principal rays are continuous with the parenchymatous matrix of the\r\ncentral core. Thick-walled tubular elements, no doubt of the nature of\r\nsieve-tubes, form a conspicuous feature in the phloem.\r\n\r\nThe three steles occasionally divide and fuse with one another. The\r\ntissue between the steles is crushed and disorganised and in the living\r\nplant was probably small in amount. In the imperfectly preserved\r\ninner cortical region there is a sinuous band of secondary parenchyma\r\n(periderm; fig. 416, A, _c_) developed from a deep-seated phellogen; in\r\nolder stems this formed the superficial tissue after the fall of the\r\nleaves. There is no definite boundary between the cortex of the stem\r\nand the petiole-bases except when the hypoderm cuts across the cortex\r\npreparatory to the separation of a leaf-stalk. The stem-cortex and\r\nthe ground-tissue of the petioles consist of parenchyma with numerous\r\nsecretory canals, not sacs only as in _Heterangium_, and are abundantly\r\nsupplied with scattered vascular bundles of collateral and exarch\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416. _Medullosa_ stems.

L,\r\n_Medullosa Solmsi_ var. _lignosa_. M, _Medullosa porosa_. (L, M, after\r\nWeber and Sterzel.)]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-traces are furnished by the peripheral tracheal groups at\r\nthe free surface of the primary portion of each stele: each trace\r\nis at first concentric and consists of primary xylem with one or\r\nmore protoxylem strands near the outer surface and is completely or\r\npartially enclosed by secondary xylem and phloem. In the course of its\r\npassage to the leaf a leaf-trace loses its secondary tissues, which\r\nwere added by the cambium during the traverse of the zone of secondary\r\nwood, and divides into small collateral bundles consisting mainly of\r\nspiral and scalariform tracheids. The collateral bundles accompanied\r\nby some narrow fibres are of the _Myeloxylon_ type (fig. 420), the\r\nxylem being wholly centripetal. In the behaviour of the leaf-traces\r\nand in the vascular system of the petioles _Medullosa_ differs from\r\n_Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_. Each leaf-base is supplied by sets\r\nof vascular strands which pass into it from the stem at different\r\nlevels; a large leaf-base reaching 4 cm. in diameter receives as many\r\nas 70–80 bundles. The hypoderm is like that first described in the\r\nFrench species _Myeloxylon Landriotii_[247] and often spoken of as the\r\n_Sparganum_ type of hypoderm. The branching of the rachises points\r\nto a compound frond, and the occurrence of numerous linear pinnules\r\nwith revolute margins (fig. 420, D) in association with the stem\r\nsuggests that the ultimate segments were of the _Alethopteris_ form.\r\nThis inference receives confirmation from the occurrence of petrified\r\nspecimens of undoubted _Alethopteris_ rachises with the structure of\r\n_Myeloxylon_. It is practically certain that the leaves borne on the\r\nstems of _Medullosa anglica_ are those long known as _Alethopteris\r\nlonchitica_ (Vol. +ii.+ A, p. 553, fig. 364).\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in the stems is the occurrence of cortical\r\nvascular strands (fig. 416, A, _a_, _b_), reaching a diameter of 7 mm.,\r\ncontaining scattered tracheids in a parenchymatous core surrounded by\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem. These cauline bundles are almost identical\r\nboth in structure and distribution with the accessory steles in the\r\nstem of a recent _Cycas_, and the agreement is emphasised by the\r\npresence of short square-ended tracheids in the primary xylem.\r\n\r\nThe roots branch freely and may attain a diameter of more than 1\r\ncm.: they are generally triarch and the triangular primary xylem is\r\nenclosed by secondary xylem except opposite the protoxylem. The cortex\r\nis like that of _Lyginopteris_ roots and a conspicuous double layer of\r\nsuperficial tissue is another feature common to both (_cf._ fig. 410).\r\nThe exceptionally well preserved specimens described by Arber[248]\r\nshow very clearly the thick zone of periderm which forms the covering\r\nof older roots, and in some of the sieve-tubes groups of dark brown\r\npatches show the form and arrangement of the sieve-plates.\r\n\r\n_Reproductive organs._ We have as yet no precise information in\r\nregard to the reproductive organs of _Medullosa anglica_, but there\r\ncan be little or no doubt that the fronds bore seeds that have long\r\nbeen known under the generic name of _Trigonocarpus_. Many years ago\r\nMr Hemingway noticed the almost constant association of the fronds\r\nof _Alethopteris lonchitica_ with _Trigonocarpus_, and Dr Kidston’s\r\ndiscovery[249] of seed-bearing _Neuropteris_ pinnae considerably\r\nstrengthened the evidence derived from mere association. The structure\r\nof _Trigonocarpus_ is described later (p. 117) in a section devoted to\r\nreproductive organs attributed to _Medullosa_. Nothing is known as to\r\nthe microspore-bearing organs.\r\n\r\nWhile in the structure of each of the steles _Medullosa anglica_ agrees\r\nvery closely with _Heterangium_, it differs from that genus in the\r\npresence of three steles and in the structure of the petioles which\r\nare much less fern-like than the simpler petioles of _Heterangium_ and\r\n_Lyginopteris_. From the continental species the British species is\r\ndistinguished by its simpler stelar system, though there is a close\r\ncorrespondence as regards individual steles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa pusilla_ Scott.\r\n\r\nThis species, briefly referred to by Scott in 1909[250] and fully\r\ndescribed in a recent paper[251], is founded on material from the\r\nLower Coal Measures of Colne, Lancashire. It agrees in essential\r\nfeatures with _Medullosa anglica_, but differs in the following\r\nparticulars: the linear dimensions of the stem are about one quarter\r\nthose of a typical stem of the older species; the leaf-traces possess\r\nlittle or no secondary xylem and the relatively large decurrent\r\nleaf-bases have a narrower and simpler hypoderm. The stem has a\r\ntri-stelar vascular system enclosed in a ring of internal periderm, and\r\neach stele (3 mm. in diameter) consists of a roughly triangular strand\r\nof reticulate tracheids and a small amount of scattered parenchyma. The\r\nprotoxylem is either exarch or, as in _M. anglica_, mesarch, the exact\r\nposition being difficult to determine in the available material. The\r\nsecondary xylem closely resembles that of _M. anglica_.\r\n\r\nScott suggests the possibility that _Alethopteris decurrens_ may be\r\nthe foliage of _Medullosa pusilla_. It is possible that there is no\r\nspecific difference between _M. pusilla_ and _M. anglica_, but on the\r\npresent evidence the employment of a distinctive name is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa centrofilis_ de Fraine.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded by Miss de Fraine[252] on a petrified stem\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire. The maximum diameter of\r\nthe flattened stem including four decurrent leaf-bases is 5 cm. The\r\nvascular system consists of an outer group of four steles, reduced\r\nto three by fusion in the upper part of the specimen, enclosing a\r\ncentral smaller stele or star-ring (fig. 417). It is the presence\r\nof the star-ring that distinguishes this type from the other two\r\nBritish species and forms a connecting link with certain continental\r\nMedullosae. The peripheral steles agree with the steles of _M. anglica_\r\nbut, as in _M. pusilla_, there is some doubt as to the exarch or\r\nmesarch position of the protoxylem. In the structure of the xylem the\r\ncentral stele conforms to the rest of the vascular system and a strand\r\nof protoxylem is preserved that is almost certainly exarch. There is\r\nevidence that the peripheral steles occasionally anastomose, but the\r\ncentral stele follows an independent course at least in the piece of\r\nstem examined. Leaf-traces are furnished by the primary xylem of the\r\nouter steles, and they appear to be without secondary tracheids as in\r\n_M. pusilla_. A zone of secondary cortex encloses the vascular system\r\nas in the other British stems: it is pointed out by Miss de Fraine[253]\r\nthat this tissue, usually described as a deep-seated periderm, must\r\nhave differed from cork in that there is no sign of drying up or\r\ndecay in the tissues external to it. The leaf-bases are of the usual\r\n_Myeloxylon_ type. In size this species is intermediate between\r\n_Medullosa anglica_ and _M. pusilla_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417. _Medullosa centrofilis._ Transverse section\r\nshowing the deep-seated ‘periderm’ (broken line) surrounding four\r\nsteles. (After de Fraine.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa stellata_ Cotta.\r\n\r\nCotta[254] described _Medullosa stellata_ as a stem characterised by\r\nthe occurrence of several many-rayed stellate columns (‘vielstrahlige\r\nSternsäule’) in a pith enclosed by a double cylinder of secondary\r\nxylem. The so-called pith is the central ground-tissue of the stem and\r\nthe double ‘striated ring’ of Cotta is a cylindrical stele identical\r\nin structure with each of the steles of _Medullosa anglica_ but having\r\na tubular form instead of forming a relatively broad and short band\r\n(_cf._ fig. 416, D and A). Goeppert[255] in his _Permian Flora_ gave a\r\ndetailed account of the species, some of his sections being cut from\r\nCotta’s material, and by the employment of varietal epithets emphasised\r\nthe range of variation within the limits of the type. Goeppert and\r\nStenzel[256] and, several years later, Weber and Sterzel[257]\r\nadopted the same plan as a convenient method of drawing attention to\r\ndifferences in anatomical characters. As Schenk[258] pointed out,\r\nthere is a considerable risk in the case of small pieces of stems of\r\nattaching excessive importance to structural variations, and it is\r\nby no means improbable, as he said, that differences which are the\r\nexpression of states of preservation or stages in development have been\r\nincorrectly regarded as distinguishing marks of individual plants.\r\nIt is, however, convenient to recognise some of the more striking\r\ndeviations from the type-species by speaking of the different forms as\r\nvarieties though, as Weber and Sterzel fully admit, such varieties and\r\neven some of the species must be looked upon as provisional. Weber and\r\nSterzel give expression to the provisional nature of their grouping by\r\nclassifying the species with their varieties into form-cycles. Under\r\nthe form-cycle _Medullosa stellata_ five more or less well defined\r\nforms are recognised, the type-species being _Medullosa stellata_ var.\r\n_typica_[259].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa stellata_ var. _typica_.\r\n\r\nPart of a transverse section of a cylindrical stem is represented\r\ndiagrammatically in fig. 416, D. Very little of the cortex is\r\npreserved: a parenchymatous axial region with scattered secretory\r\ncanals contains four oval or cylindrical vascular steles, the stellate\r\ncolumns of Cotta or star-rings of later authors. These are of the\r\nsame nature as the small central stele in the English _Medullosa\r\ncentrofilis_. The central region of the stem in this specimen is\r\ncompletely surrounded by a narrow cylinder of inversely orientated\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem (fig. 416, D), the phloem being on the\r\ninner side of the xylem. Beyond the xylem is a parenchymatous band\r\ncontaining scattered groups of primary xylem tracheids with spiral,\r\nscalariform, and reticulate pitting, and this zone, which is usually\r\ndesignated the ‘partial pith,’ is succeeded by a second and broader,\r\nnormally orientated, cylinder of secondary xylem and phloem. In this\r\nsection the two concentric cylinders separated by the partial pith\r\nform a solenostele like that of several recent Ferns except in the\r\npresence of secondary tissue. The term ‘partial pith’ applied to the\r\ntissue between the two cylinders of secondary tissue is misleading:\r\nthis tissue (fig. 416, D, _p_) is the primary xylem of the stele and\r\nis homologous with the primary portion of the stele of _Heterangium_\r\nand of the steles of _M. anglica_. In many sections the continuity of\r\nthe tubular stele is broken. In a section in the British Museum cut\r\nfrom one of Cotta’s specimens[260], 6 × 3·5 cm. in diameter to the\r\nouter edge of the vascular tissue, the cylindrical stele is interrupted\r\nat two places. An example of the interrupted type of stele is shown\r\nin fig. 416, F, and in fig. 416, H: the latter belongs to a distinct\r\nspecies. The complete type of cylindrical stele is exceptional and\r\noccurs occasionally at different levels in the stem. An important point\r\nis that the frequent breaks in the cylinder are not connected with the\r\nexit of leaf-traces and do not, therefore, correspond to the foliar\r\ngaps in the solenostele or dictyostele of a Fern.\r\n\r\nThe secondary xylem is of the cycadean type (fig. 418, B, D) like that\r\nof _Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_ and several other stems. Each of\r\nthe star-rings in the axial region consists of a parenchymatous core\r\nwith scattered primary tracheids enclosed by secondary vascular tissue\r\n(fig. 418, B). The star-ring shown in fig. 418, B, from a Chemnitz stem\r\nillustrates the characteristic cycadean character of the secondary\r\nxylem with broad medullary rays: some of the innermost elements are in\r\ncontact with the primary tracheids. The phloem is rendered conspicuous\r\nby the black contents in some of the elements. Both the star-rings and\r\nthe larger peripheral steles are constructed on the same plan and agree\r\nwith the steles of _M. anglica_. The star-rings occasionally branch\r\nand anastomose with one another and with the encircling stele. The\r\nstar-ring in fig. 416, D at _a_ is about to give off a small strand.\r\n\r\nLeaf-traces are furnished by the primary xylem at the edge of the\r\n‘partial pith’ of the outer stele: as a leaf-trace passes outwards\r\nthrough the outer cylinder of secondary xylem the cambium invests it\r\nwith secondary xylem and phloem, but as it passes through the cortex of\r\nthe stem it becomes reduced to its primary elements, and by successive\r\nbranching gives rise to small collateral bundles which enter the\r\npetioles. The piece of stem shown in fig. 416, G, illustrates the\r\nexit of leaf-traces from the stele and their subsequent division into\r\nseveral small bundles, _v_, which are scattered in the cortex with\r\nstrands of sclerenchyma. In a specimen identified with _Medullosa\r\nstellata_, Schenk[261] found part of a leaf-base attached to the stem:\r\nits vascular system was of the _Myeloxylon_ type, the bundles being\r\nidentical with those in the cortex of the stem seen in fig. 416, G.\r\n\r\nIn some stems of _M. stellata_ the outer, centrifugally developed,\r\nportion of the main stele is very much broader than in the example\r\nrepresented in fig. 416, D. The diagrammatic sketch reproduced in fig.\r\n416, F, represents a section of a Chemnitz specimen in the British\r\nMuseum[262] in which the axial region containing several star-rings\r\nis almost enclosed by an inner zone of secondary xylem, and beyond\r\nthe narrow primary xylem (black in the sketch) the rest of the block\r\nconsists exclusively of secondary xylem 5·5 cm. broad. This example\r\nillustrates a common tendency in _Medullosa_ towards a large excess\r\nof centrifugal over centripetal secondary vascular tissue. A similar\r\nspecimen of _Medullosa stellata_ is figured by Mougeot[263] from\r\nthe Vosges showing a considerable development of centrifugal xylem\r\ncomparable with that in the British Museum stem. Weber and Sterzel[264]\r\ndescribe stems of _Medullosa stellata_ showing slight periodic\r\nswellings which it is suggested, though there is no evidence in support\r\nof the opinion, may be connected with reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Medullosa stellata_ var. _corticata_[265]. The specimen referred to\r\nthis variety, represented in fig. 416, G, has already been quoted\r\nas affording data with regard to the origin and behaviour of the\r\nleaf-traces. In this type of stem the outer portion of the main stele\r\nis narrower than in _M. stellata_ var. _typica_ and the stele never\r\nforms a complete tube. The star-rings in the centre of the stem are\r\nmore numerous than in the type-species of the genus. In the axial\r\nregion of some stems included in the form-cycle to which _M. stellata_\r\nbelongs there may be flatter and tangentially elongated vascular\r\nstrands in addition to the cylindrical star-rings; these are termed\r\nplate-rings.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Medullosa stellata_ var. _lignosa_[266] the outer xylem reaches a\r\nbreadth of 4 cm. and the star-rings are reduced to one. The form _M.\r\nstellata_ var. _gigantea_[267] (fig. 416, K) is of special interest as\r\nan example of a stem reaching a diameter of nearly 50 cm. and having\r\nas many as 43 large and small star-rings in the axial region. A large\r\ntubular stele like that of the type-species (fig. 416, D) surrounds the\r\ncentral region, but in this form the cylindrical stele _a_ is succeeded\r\nby concentric cylinders of normally orientated xylem and phloem (fig.\r\n416, K, _bb_) produced by successive cambiums either cortical or\r\npericyclic in origin. This type of stem presents a striking resemblance\r\nto stems of _Cycas_ and _Macrozamia_ except in the possession of a\r\ndouble cylindrical stele consisting of both centripetal and centrifugal\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem separated by a zone of primary xylem\r\n(partial pith).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa gigas_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on a piece of stem from the Permian of\r\nAutun[268], consisting almost entirely of secondary xylem, which\r\nBrongniart had previously placed in his genus _Palaeoxylon_[269]. The\r\nsecondary xylem reaches a diameter of 45–50 cm. and in the portion of\r\nthe central region preserved there are a few vascular strands like the\r\nstar-rings of other species. The considerable development of secondary\r\nxylem indicates a form of stem similar to some forms of _M. stellata_\r\n(_e.g._ fig. 416, F), but as the available data are insufficient for\r\naccurate determination Renault’s specific name is retained. Renault\r\ndescribes the internal xylem cylinder (_i.e._ the centripetal xylem) as\r\nvery slightly developed or as hardly visible, a feature in which the\r\nFrench specimen shows a nearer approach to the structure of a recent\r\nCycad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa porosa_ Cotta.\r\n\r\nThe second of Cotta’s species[270], which has been fully investigated\r\nby Weber and Sterzel, is constructed on the same plan as that of _M.\r\nstellata_, but the stem is distinguished by the greater number of\r\nstar-rings and, more especially, by the presence of an outer system\r\nof vascular strands in the axial region (fig. 416, M): these form a\r\nfrequently interrupted cylinder of anastomosing strands characterised\r\nby the feeble development of secondary xylem and phloem or by the\r\nabsence of this tissue on the outer face of the strands. The component\r\nparts of this outer series occasionally fuse with the internal\r\nstar-rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa Solmsi_ Schenk[271] var. _typica_ Web. and Ster.[272]\r\n\r\nThis type has a large axial region containing several very small\r\nstar-rings enclosed by two concentric zones of separate plate-rings\r\n(fig. 416, E) each consisting of a complete flattened cylinder of\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem enclosing primary xylem. As the complete\r\ncylindrical stele of the stem of _Medullosa stellata_ shown in fig.\r\n416, D, was compared with the solenostele of a Fern, so in this\r\nstem (fig. 416, E) the vascular cylinder may be compared at least\r\nsuperficially with a dictyostele. From the inner circle of plate-rings\r\nstrands are given off in the form of star-rings and these pass through\r\nthe gaps in the outer system, eventually breaking up in the cortex into\r\nnumerous collateral bundles. In another form of this species, var.\r\n_lignosa_ (fig. 416, L), the axial region is enclosed by a circle of\r\nplate-rings like those in the type-form, but these are succeeded by a\r\ncircle of very asymmetrically developed and large steles with the outer\r\nxylem and phloem much broader than the inner. Moreover in this form\r\nadditional cylinders of normally orientated vascular tissue are added\r\nas in _M. stellata_ var. _gigantea_ and in some recent Cycads. It is\r\nnoteworthy that the secondary wood of _Medullosa Solmsi_ is rather more\r\ncompact than in other species, a feature in which it to some extent\r\nagrees with the South African genus _Rhexoxylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medullosa Leuckarti_ Goeppert and Stenzel.\r\n\r\nIn this species[273], also from the Permian of Saxony, the central\r\nregion including some star-rings is surrounded by sinuous flattened\r\nconcentric steles (snake-rings) agreeing anatomically with the steles\r\nof other species and characterised by the comparatively small breadth\r\nof the secondary xylem and phloem (fig. 416, H). Leaf-traces are given\r\noff, as in _M. anglica_ and other species, from the outer edge of the\r\nprimary xylem. In some forms there is a single set of snake-rings;\r\nin others there is a double series. Fig. 418, D, shows part of the\r\nsecondary xylem of a stele of this species from Chemnitz: the tracheids\r\nare in some places continuous with the primary xylem, and on the outer\r\nedge of the secondary wood is a cylinder of phloem. A section of\r\n_Medullosa Leuckarti_ figured by Goeppert and Stenzel[274] shows some\r\nradial rows of very thick-walled elements in the secondary phloem which\r\nthey describe as bast sclerenchyma, but Solms-Laubach[275] believes\r\nthem to be sieve-tubes. Precisely similar elements are figured by\r\nScott[276] in _M. anglica_ and as this author suggests the thick walls\r\nare probably not an original feature. The structure of the primary\r\nxylem is more clearly seen in fig. 418, C, and the relation between\r\nprimary and secondary xylem is shown in fig. 416, I, where the position\r\nof the protoxylem may be either exarch or mesarch. The protoxylem is\r\nonly occasionally recognisable but some of the peripheral primary\r\ntracheal groups are undoubtedly mesarch. External to the stele, a\r\npart of which is reproduced in fig. 418, D, are strands of stereome\r\nelements and beyond them a band of radially elongated cells that may\r\nbe ‘periderm’: still farther out there are some imperfectly preserved\r\nvascular bundles that are leaf-traces. This species is important as\r\naffording a complete demonstration of the organic connexion between the\r\nstem and petioles of the _Myeloxylon Landrioti_ type which indicate\r\nthat the fronds were probably Alethopteroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418.

The figure is a slightly simplified version of\r\nthat given by Weber and Sterzel; it represents the stem of _Medullosa\r\nLeuckarti_ as a transparent object, the two lower transverse sections,\r\nB and C, being seen in perspective through the longitudinal faces. The\r\nsteles are shaded obliquely in the longitudinal sections, and in the\r\nthree transverse sections, A, B, C, the primary xylem (partial pith)\r\nis black and the enclosing secondary vascular tissue radially shaded.\r\nThe whole block is 9 cm. in length and 6 cm. broad. Only a part of\r\nthe axial region is shown internal to the peripheral snake-rings and\r\nin it are the star-rings _S_, _S_, _b_, and _c_. Outside the main\r\nsteles is the narrow cortex _R_ and portions of leaf-bases _I–IV_.\r\nThe lowest section, C, shows part of a peripheral snake-ring with a\r\nslight swelling at _f_ on its inner side which, as seen in sections\r\nB and A, foreshadows the separation of the star-ring _S_ and the\r\nconsequent break in the continuity of the snake-ring (_d_, _e_, sect.\r\nB). In section A the gap is closed: in the longitudinal section\r\nbetween B and A the star-ring _S_ is seen to form two branches, _a_\r\nand _b_, the branch _a_ closing the gap between _d_ and _e_ in section\r\nB. These sections demonstrate the formation of a star-ring from the\r\nmain peripheral stele and the formation of additional star-rings by\r\nbranching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419. _Medullosa Leuckarti._ Diagrammatic sketch\r\nof stem showing longitudinal and transverse sections: for explanation\r\nsee text. (After Weber and Sterzel.)]\r\n\r\nNumerous vascular bundles destined for the leaves are scattered in\r\nthe cortex. The course of the decurrent leaf-base _I_ is shown on the\r\nlongitudinal faces, its boundary being marked by crowded stereome\r\nstrands (of the _Myeloxylon Landrioti_ type); other leaf-bases are\r\nrepresented by _II_, _III_, and _IV_.\r\n\r\nIn habit _Medullosa Leuckarti_ differs from such a type as _M.\r\nstellata_ in its relatively shorter and stouter stem and in the shorter\r\ninternodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Leaves and Reproductive Organs.+\r\n\r\ni. _Leaves._ It has already been stated that in some cases petioles\r\noccur in organic connexion with Medullosan stems, notably in _M.\r\nanglica_ and _M. Leuckarti_: in the exceptionally rich collection in\r\nthe Chemnitz Museum, which forms a fitting memorial of the work of\r\nthe late Prof. Sterzel, there is a stem of _M. Leuckarti_ bearing\r\nlarge petioles of the type known as _Myeloxylon radiatum_. The\r\noccurrence of vascular bundles in the cortex of other species of stem\r\nidentical with those in the attached petioles points to a uniform\r\ntype of leaf-structure so far as regards the petioles and rachises\r\nof _Medullosa_. While it is clearly unnecessary to distinguish by a\r\nspecial generic title the petrified portions of fronds known to belong\r\nto certain species of stems, the frequent occurrence of detached\r\npetioles necessitates some distinctive term. The name employed is\r\n_Myeloxylon_: the genus was instituted by Brongniart in 1849 for\r\nCotta’s species _Medullosa elegans_ the petiolar nature of which was\r\nsuspected by Binney in 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myeloxylon_ (Medullosan leaf-stalks).\r\n\r\n  1832. _Medullosa elegans_ Cotta. 1865. _Stenzelia_ Goeppert. 1876.\r\n        _Myelopteris_ Renault[279]; 1877, _Aulacopteris_\r\n        Grand’Eury[280].\r\n\r\nThere is a very close agreement in general anatomical structure\r\nbetween the numerous specimens of _Myeloxylon_ from the Permian strata\r\nof Saxony and France and the Coal Measures and Millstone Grit of\r\nEngland[281]; the genus is also recorded from the Upper Carboniferous\r\nof Kansas[282]. Two well-defined types instituted by Renault are,\r\nhowever, readily distinguished by the form of the hypodermal stereome\r\nstrands. _Myeloxylon_ may be defined as follows: Oval or cylindrical\r\nbranched axes, reaching a diameter of 15 cm., bearing pinnae having\r\nthe characters of _Alethopteris_, _Neuropteris_, _Odontopteris_,\r\nand some other genera that were formerly classed as Ferns. Below a\r\nsingle-layered epidermis, in which stomata have been recognised,\r\noccur a few layers of parenchyma: this superficial tissue, which is\r\nrarely preserved, is succeeded by a hypodermal region consisting\r\nof parenchymatous tissue and numerous vertical groups of narrow\r\nthick-walled fibres arranged as radial plates or circular, oval, or\r\nreniform strands (the _Sparganum_ type of cortex). In the hypoderm as\r\nin the ground-tissue generally secretory canals, often accompanied\r\nby stereome, are a characteristic feature. The vascular system is\r\nrepresented by a considerable number of collateral bundles scattered\r\nthrough the ground-tissue and especially abundant in the outer region:\r\nthe bundles sometimes assume a more or less regular disposition in\r\nconcentric circles. Each bundle consists of a small group of xylem\r\ntracheids, for the most part spiral or scalariform, though reticulately\r\npitted elements are by no means rare, with a single protoxylem group on\r\nthe outer face next the phloem (fig. 420, B, C). As a rule the xylem\r\nis wholly centripetal, but occasionally the exarch structure becomes\r\nmesarch by the occurrence of a few centrifugal tracheids. The phloem,\r\nrarely preserved (fig. 420, B), consists of narrow sieve-tubes with\r\nparenchyma, and the bundle as a whole is often partially enclosed by a\r\nsheath of fibres.\r\n\r\nSuperficially the anatomical structure is similar to that of the\r\npetioles of _Angiopteris_ or _Marattia_, and both Williamson[283] and\r\nRenault placed _Myeloxylon_ in the Ferns; but the collateral form\r\nof the vascular bundles, the position of the protoxylem, and the\r\narrangement of the hypoderm tissues, are cycadean features.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myeloxylon radiatum_ (Renault).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420. A, B, _Myeloxylon radiatum_; A, petiole ⅔\r\nnat. size; B, vascular bundle. C, _Myeloxylon_ sp. vascular bundle;\r\n_px_, protoxylem. D, _Medullosa anglica_; section of pinnule. (A, B,\r\nafter Zeiller; D, after Scott.)]\r\n\r\nThis type is characterised by the radially elongated stereome of the\r\nhypoderm. Prof. Zeiller[284], who has given a very clear and concise\r\ndescription of _Myeloxylon_, is disposed to regard Cotta’s _Medullosa\r\nelegans_ as a specifically distinct form on the ground that there are\r\ntwo concentric zones of stereome in the hypoderm; but this feature is\r\nshown only in one of Cotta’s figures, and Weber and Sterzel[285] point\r\nout that a doubting of the hypoderm zone may be caused by accidental\r\njuxtaposition of two faulted pieces of peripheral tissue. The drawing\r\nreproduced in fig. 420, A, shows the structural plan of an unusually\r\nlarge petiole from the Permian of Autun: a portion of the outer\r\ntissue is seen in fig. 418, A. The vascular bundle, fig. 420, C, from\r\na Millstone Grit specimen[286], shows the centripetal nature of the\r\nxylem and fragments of phloem in the outer half of the bundle, with\r\nimperfectly preserved fibres abutting on the xylem. The characteristic\r\nhypoderm is shown also in fig. 418, A; the double xylem strand on the\r\nleft illustrates a common feature caused by the branching of vascular\r\nbundles. Several secretory canals are scattered in the ground-tissue.\r\nThe pinnules of _Myeloxylon radiatum_, or at least of some specimens,\r\nhave been shown by Renault to be of the _Neuropteris_ type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myeloxylon Landrioti_ (Renault)[287].\r\n\r\nIn this species the distinguishing feature is the occurrence of the\r\nhypodermal stereome in the form of circular, oval, or reniform strands\r\nin place of the radial plates of _M. radiatum_. It is this form of\r\npetiole that was borne by the stems of _Medullosa anglica_ and _M.\r\nLeuckarti_. In _M. anglica_ the pinnules (fig. 420, D) are of the\r\n_Alethopteris_ type, almost certainly _A. lonchitica_. Renault and\r\nZeiller have described French specimens of _Myeloxylon Landrioti_\r\nbearing pinnules like those of _Alethopteris aquilina_ and _A.\r\nGrandini_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myeloxylon topekense_ (Penhallow).\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of _Myeloxylon_ petioles in the New World was recorded\r\nby the late Prof. Penhallow[288] who founded this species on some\r\nimperfectly petrified specimens from Upper Carboniferous strata at\r\nTopeka, Kansas. Enough material was available to show the _Myeloxylon_\r\ncharacters, but the preservation is too imperfect to admit of a\r\ncomplete diagnosis. The hypodermal stereome shows a tendency to form\r\ntangentially extended strands in place of the more circular or radially\r\nelongated groups in the European species.\r\n\r\nIn addition to _Alethopteris_, _Neuropteris_ (including _Cyclopteris_)\r\nand _Odontopteris_ fronds, which are known to possess rachises with\r\nthe _Myeloxylon_ features, there is reason to believe that the Permian\r\n_Callipteris_ fronds and possibly some of the older _Taeniopteris_\r\nleaves may also belong to _Medullosa_[289]. It is, however, unsafe to\r\nassume that the occurrence of _Myeloxylon_ petioles necessarily denotes\r\nthe existence of _Medullosa_. The French stem _Colpoxylon aeduense_\r\nBrongn.[290] bore leaves with the same general anatomical features as\r\nthose of a typical _Myeloxylon_, and there can be little doubt that\r\nother genera of the Medulloseae also possessed fronds constructed\r\non the same plan as those known to have been borne by _Medullosa_.\r\nAn interesting illustration of an injured organ that had produced a\r\nwound-cambium is afforded by a _Myeloxylon_ petiole from the Coal\r\nMeasures described by Mr Holden[291].\r\n\r\n\r\n+Reproductive Organs.+\r\n\r\nReference was made in volume +ii.+ to the reasons which led to the\r\nremoval of several genera of Carboniferous and Permian fronds from\r\nthe Filicales to the Pteridosperms, and in Chapter +xxix.+ of the\r\npresent volume certain species of _Sphenopteris_ are described as the\r\nfoliage of _Lyginopteris_ and _Heterangium_. It is with such genera\r\nas _Neuropteris_, _Alethopteris_, _Linopteris_ and others that we are\r\nnow more especially concerned, as they represent some of the types of\r\nleaves borne by _Medullosa_ and other members of the Medulloseae. The\r\nabsence of any specimens among the large number of these common genera\r\nbearing undoubted sporangia aroused suspicion as to the correctness\r\nof the generally accepted view that these fern-like fossils were\r\nthe leaves of Palaeozoic Ferns. Subsequently the suspicion based on\r\nnegative evidence was confirmed by researches into the anatomical\r\nstructure of the leaf-bases, petioles, and fragments of pinnae attached\r\nto and associated with stems of _Medullosa_. It is only in a few\r\ncases that actual organic connexion between reproductive organs and\r\nMedullosan leaves has been demonstrated, but from such facts as are\r\nestablished it is safe to make the general statement that stems of\r\n_Medullosa_—a generic term that undoubtedly includes plants which,\r\nhad we a fuller knowledge of them as complete individuals, would be\r\nassigned to more than one generic type—possessed fronds simulating in\r\nhabit those of certain Ferns with some of the pinnae bearing seeds\r\noften of considerable size and in all cases of complex structure,\r\nagreeing in many respects with those of existing Cycads, while other\r\nfronds, or in some cases it may be other pinnae, bore microsporangia\r\nsimilar in form to the sporangia of Ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Microsporangia._\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris._ A. _Neuropteris heterophylla[292]._\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of supposed fertile specimens of _Neuropteris_\r\nare recorded in palaeobotanical literature, but it was not until\r\n1887 that any satisfactory specimen was discovered. In that year\r\nKidston[293] described a specimen of _Neuropteris heterophylla_\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Scotland in which slender forked\r\nbranchlets bear small bodies at their tips some of which appear to\r\nrepresent four-valved organs (fig. 421, D), though the imperfect\r\nstate of preservation renders impossible any definite pronouncement\r\nas to their structure. To the specimen are attached a few sterile\r\npinnules, showing that it is a portion of a frond of _N. heterophylla_\r\ncharacterised by the substitution of reproductive organs for pinnules.\r\nThe subsequent discovery of seeds attached to pinnae of the same\r\nspecies afforded strong presumptive evidence, almost amounting to\r\nproof, of the microsporangial nature of the Scotch specimen. For\r\nthis specimen, although no precise diagnosis is possible, Dr P.\r\nBertrand[294] has proposed the generic name _Neurotheca_. In 1911\r\nthe Abbé Carpentier[295] described some small ovoid bodies, 1–1·5\r\nmm. long, from the Coal Measures of France arranged in groups of 4\r\nto 6 and in some cases said to be borne on a slender pedicel which\r\nhe found in association with _N. heterophylla_ and compared with\r\nsporangia described by Lesquereux from the Coal Measures of Arkansas as\r\n_Sorocladus stellata_[296]. These supposed microsporangia have recently\r\nbeen assigned by Bertrand[297] to _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421.\r\n  A. _Potoniea adiantiformis_ Zeill. (very slightly enlarged).\r\n  B. Microsporangia of _Potoniea_ (enlarged).\r\n  C. _Linopteris obliqua_; side-view of microsporophyll.\r\n  D. _Neuropteris heterophylla_, pinnules and microsporangia (?).\r\n  E. _Linopteris obliqua_, surface-view of microsporophyll.\r\n  (A, C, E, after P. Bertrand; B, after Carpentier; D, after Kidston.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Neuropteris gigantea_, etc. _Potoniea_, Zeiller.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Zeiller[298] instituted the name _Potoniea_ for some peculiar\r\nfertile leaves found in the Coal Measures of Heraclea consisting\r\nof a branched axis with cuneate segments, 7–10 × 6–8 mm., bearing\r\nnumerous fusiform bodies, 1–1·5 mm. long, at the upper edge (fig.\r\n421, A). These marginal bodies he regarded as sporangia and expressed\r\nthe opinion that _Potoniea_ may be the fructification of some form\r\nof _Neuropteris_, _Mariopteris_ or _Alethopteris_. Carpentier[299]\r\nafterwards described similar though rather larger examples from\r\nthe Pas-de-Calais coal-field as microsporophyll fragments of some\r\nPteridosperm: he stated that similar specimens had been found by\r\nKidston in England. In a later work Carpentier[300] described the\r\nsporangia as crowded in groups (fig. 421, B) in the substance of the\r\nthick lamina of _Potoniea_, and he connected the fertile segments\r\nwith _Neuropteris gigantea_, _N. pseudogigantea_ Pot. and _Linopteris\r\nobliqua_ (Bunb.). Similar specimens are said to have been found in\r\nHolland and Silesia. Bertrand[301] also records the association of\r\n_Potoniea_ with _Neuropteris gigantea_ and _N. pseudogigantea_: he\r\ndescribes some specimens as belonging to _N. gigantea_ Sternb. while\r\nothers, distinguished only by small differences, he attributes to _N.\r\npseudogigantea_. Kidston[302] has recently drawn attention to the\r\ninconstancy of the characters mentioned by Potonié as distinguishing\r\nfeatures of _N. pseudogigantea_, and he shows good cause for referring\r\nthe examples so named to _N. gigantea_. The fertile lamina is almost\r\norbicular in surface-view and attached to a slightly excentric pedicel;\r\nthe microsporangia are borne on the lower surface and probably in\r\ngroups as described by Carpentier.\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris Carpentieri_ Kidston. Kidston[303] has recently described\r\nsome fertile leaflets under this name from the Westphalian series of\r\nSouth Staffordshire which he identifies with French examples referred\r\nby Carpentier[304] to _Potoniea adiantiformis_ Zeill. The fertile\r\npinnules are thick and sub-cyclopteroid in form; the upper surface\r\nbears densely packed, narrow and long, microsporangia, 4 × 0·5 mm.,\r\ncontaining more or less spherical microspores 45–60μ in diameter;\r\nthe ventral face of the lamina on the removal of the spores shows\r\nseveral strong veins. With these are associated sterile pinnules of\r\nthe Neuropteroid type, and examples are described intermediate between\r\nthe sterile and fertile leaflets. Kidston believes the specimens to be\r\nmicrosporophylls of some species of _Neuropteris_, but as the material\r\ndoes not suffice for identification with any known species a new name\r\nis proposed. It is pointed out that in some states of preservation\r\nthe leaflets resemble Goeppert’s Permian species _Dictyothalamus\r\nSchrollianus_[305].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alethopteris. Linopteris._\r\n\r\nNo specimens of _Alethopteris_ fronds have so far been described that\r\nafford any information as to the nature of the microsporangia, and we\r\nhave no means of knowing whether they were borne on naked pedicels\r\nas in _Neuropteris heterophylla_, or on modified pinnules as in _N.\r\ngigantea_.\r\n\r\nZeiller in 1888[306] described some fertile pinnules of _Dictyopteris\r\nSchützii_ Roem. from Commentry bearing two rows of long sporangia: he\r\nsubsequently transferred this species to the genus _Linopteris_[307]\r\nand expressed the opinion that the sporangia occur singly and not\r\nin groups as he originally believed. Zeiller compares the fertile\r\npinnules with the type _Crossotheca_. Bertrand[308], as the result\r\nof examining similar specimens, has suggested that the fringe of\r\npendulous bodies regarded by Zeiller as sporangia may be tooth-like\r\nlobes of modified pinnules which served to protect microsporangia\r\nborne on the lower surface of the lamina. The nature of the\r\nimpressions is not clear, though there is little doubt that they are\r\nmicrosporophylls. The fertile pinnae of _Linopteris obliqua_ (Bunb.)\r\ndescribed by Carpentier[309] and Bertrand[310] closely resemble the\r\nmicrospore-bearing organs which have been referred to _Neuropteris\r\ngigantea_; they have the characters of _Potoniea_ and consist of oval\r\nlaminae similar to the sterile pinnules but about half their size: the\r\nlamina was attached excentrically to a slender stalk (fig. 421, C, E)\r\nand traversed by numerous occasionally anastomosing veins. No actual\r\nmicrosporangia have been discovered in organic connexion with the\r\nlamina.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Megasporangia._\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris._\r\n\r\nKidston’s discovery of undoubted seeds attached to pinnae of\r\n_Neuropteris_[311] marked an important step in our more exact\r\nknowledge of the morphology of Medullosan sporophylls. Specimens from\r\nthe ironstone balls (Coal Measures) of Coseley near Dudley showed\r\nseeds attached to portions of pinnae bearing pinnules of _Neuropteris\r\nheterophylla_. The seeds are approximately 3 cm. long and from 1·10\r\nto 1·40 cm. broad; oblong and gradually tapering from the middle to a\r\nslightly curved and obtuse apical snout (fig. 422). The outer surface\r\nshows numerous longitudinal ribs which no doubt represent hypodermal\r\nfibres. The preservation of the seeds, which appear to be circular in\r\nsection, is not such as to render possible a description of structural\r\nfeatures. In their asymmetrical form the seeds agree with the genus\r\n_Platyspermum_ as recently defined by Arber, but Kidston’s specimens\r\nare in all probability radiospermic. Kidston compares the _Neuropteris_\r\nseeds with _Rhabdocarpus tunicatus_ as figured from the Commentry\r\ncoalfield[312] and with specimens from Gard named by Grand’Eury _R.\r\nsubtunicatus_[313].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422. _Neuropterocarpus Kidstoni_ (Arber). (After\r\nKidston; × 3.)]\r\n\r\nAdditional proof of the occurrence of seeds on _Neuropteris_ fronds is\r\nfurnished by examples from the Coal Measures of Holland described by\r\nKidston and Jongmans[314]: these seeds are of the same general type as\r\nthose from Coseley but nearly twice as large, and they were borne at\r\nthe tips of a dichotomously branched pedicel of _Neuropteris obliqua_.\r\nGrand’Eury in 1904[315] recorded the association of radiospermic\r\nseeds with _Neuropteris_ fronds though no case of actual attachment\r\nwas found. It is, however, noteworthy that he speaks of the frequent\r\nassociation with _Neuropteris_ of seeds characterised by six or\r\nrarely twelve longitudinal keels, a feature recalling the sclerotesta\r\nof _Trigonocarpus_ and allied seeds. Until petrified specimens are\r\navailable it is impossible to refer the seeds of _Neuropteris_ to a\r\ngeneric type founded on structural features: the seeds described by\r\nKidston are, as he says, very similar in external characters to species\r\nassigned to _Rhabdocarpus_, and there can be little doubt as to the\r\ngeneric identity of the _Neuropteris_ seeds and some of the impressions\r\nreferred to _Rhabdocarpus_ which are characterised by a similarity in\r\nform, an apical snout that gives an asymmetrical appearance to the\r\nspecimens and the presence of numerous longitudinal striations[316].\r\nIt is, however, by no means certain that these seeds possessed the\r\nmorphological features of _Rhabdocarpus_ as described by Brongniart in\r\npetrified examples from St Étienne[317].\r\n\r\nThe seeds of _Neuropteris_ may, as Kidston suggests, agree anatomically\r\nmore closely with _Pachytesta_[318], a type that Grand’Eury associates\r\nwith _Alethopteris_ fronds. With a view to avoid the danger of\r\nincorrectly identifying petrified specimens and impressions that\r\ncannot be proved to belong to the same generic type, I have suggested\r\nthe restriction of the name _Rhabdocarpus_[319] to seeds that do\r\nnot furnish evidence as to internal structure, and the employment\r\nof the designation _Rhabdospermum_ for seeds that conform to those\r\ndescribed by Brongniart as _Rhabdocarpus_. The seeds of _Neuropteris_\r\nmay be of the _Rhabdospermum_ type or they may agree anatomically more\r\nclosely with _Trigonocarpus_ or _Pachytesta_; they are members of\r\neither the Trigonocarpales or the Cardiocarpales, probably the former\r\ngroup. Dr P. Bertrand[320] assigns to _Neuropteris gigantea_ some\r\nseeds of the _Hexapterospermum_ (= _Hexagonocarpus_[321]) type which\r\noccur in association with cupule-like organs. These supposed cupules\r\nresemble the _Potoniea_ leaflets with microsporangia also referred\r\nto the same species of _Neuropteris_; they are characterised by a\r\nlaciniate edge and may be compared with the Indian fossil described\r\nby Zeiller as _Ottokaria bengalensis_[322] (fig. 433). Dr Arber[323]\r\nand Dr P. Bertrand[324] have independently proposed the generic name\r\n_Neurospermum_ for the seeds of _Neuropteris heterophylla_ and _N.\r\nobliqua_ in preference to _Rhabdocarpus_: the former author speaks\r\nof the seeds of _N. heterophylla_ as _Neurospermum Kidstoni_. The\r\ngeneric term _Neuropterocarpus_ used by Grand’Eury in 1904[325],\r\nthough not defined by him, has priority and avoids the adoption of a\r\nnew designation for seeds attached to _Neuropteris_ fronds. In his\r\ndefinition of _Neurospermum_ Arber makes no reference to the obliquity\r\nof the apical snout that is clearly shown in fig. 422. There is no\r\nevidence that _Neuropterocarpus_ possessed a cupular investment\r\ncomparable with that of _Lagenostoma_. Additional instances of the\r\nassociation of seeds with _Neuropteris_ fronds are recorded by Renier\r\nfrom the Belgian Coal Measures, also by Bertrand and Chodat from\r\nFrance: Renier found seeds associated with _N. Schlehani_ Stur and with\r\nthe same species of frond Bertrand found impressions of oval ribbed\r\nseeds. Prof. Chodat[326] has figured some fragments of _Neuropteris_\r\npinnules referred to _N. auriculata_ Brongn. from the Stephanian\r\nof France which show small seed-like bodies apparently in organic\r\nconnexion with the lamina; but the specimens are too imperfect to\r\nafford any satisfactory evidence as to the nature of the reproductive\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nLotsy[327] has expressed the opinion that the bodies attached to\r\n_Neuropteris_ pinnae described by Kidston and other authors as seeds\r\nmay possibly be vegetative buds, but if this were the case one would\r\nexpect to find some evidence of the bud-nature in some at least of the\r\nspecimens that have already been found.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the microsporophylls of _Neuropteris_ were\r\nconstructed on different plans, some being of the type described by\r\nZeiller and other observers as _Potoniea_, while others bore sporangia\r\non pinnae without any accompanying laminae; but our knowledge of\r\nthe latter form represented by Kidston’s specimen of _Neuropteris\r\nheterophylla_ (fig. 421, D) is very incomplete. On the other hand the\r\nseeds appear to have been characterised by features suggesting a close\r\naffinity to _Trigonocarpus_ and pointing to membership of the same\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alethopteris._\r\n\r\nAlthough no specimens have been discovered showing actual connexion\r\nbetween fronds and seeds, it is practically certain that _Alethopteris_\r\nleaves, or at least some species of the genus, bore seeds of the\r\n_Trigonocarpus_ type. The association of _Trigonocarpus Parkinsoni_\r\nwith _Alethopteris lonchitica_ is too frequent to be fortuitous and\r\nthere is further evidence afforded by certain anatomical resemblances.\r\nIn France other species of _Alethopteris_, _e.g._ _Alethopteris Serlii_\r\nand _A. Grandini_, occur in association with _Pachytesta_[328], a large\r\nseed similar to _Trigonocarpus_, and _Trigonocarpus_ is found in the\r\nPas-de-Calais coal-field with _Alethopteris Serlii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=TRIGONOCARPUS.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Trigonocarpum_ was instituted by Brongniart in\r\n1828[329] for ovoid longitudinally ribbed ‘fruits’ from Upper\r\nCarboniferous strata, the type-species being named _T. Parkinsoni_. The\r\ngeneric name is often altered to _Trigonocarpon_: Williamson[330], who\r\nadopted this form, states that Brongniart substituted _Trigonocarpon_\r\nfor _Trigonocarpum_ in his _Tableau_[331], but in that work the\r\noriginal termination is used, the form _Trigonocarpon_, probably the\r\nresult of a slip, appearing only in the index. In his later work on\r\nseeds Brongniart adopted the name _Trigonocarpus_, and in recent years\r\nthis has been widely employed. Among other species named by Brongniart\r\nare two previously referred by Sternberg to _Palmacites_. Several\r\nexamples of Brongniart’s genus were described by Lindley and Hutton,\r\nand in their description of _T. Noeggerathii_ the statement is made\r\nthat a fractured specimen demonstrated that ‘the fossil in its ordinary\r\nstate is an interior part divested of fleshy covering’[332]; this\r\nsuspicion of the true nature of the nut-like fossils was afterwards\r\nproved correct by the investigations of Hooker and Binney[333] and by\r\nthe later work of Williamson. The specimens on which the genus was\r\nfounded are casts of seed-cavities and it is in this state that the\r\nseeds are usually preserved, often in large numbers, in the sandstones\r\nof the Coal Measures, as in the block shown in fig. 423 from the famous\r\nquarry at Peel near Bolton, Lancashire. Another type of preservation is\r\nrepresented by the seeds figured by Lindley and Hutton as _Carpolithes\r\nalata_[334], but the generic identity of the two states was not\r\nrecognised until the discovery of petrified material afforded the clue.\r\nFigs. 424, 1, 425 illustrate the appearance of _Trigonocarpus_ when\r\npreserved as a carbonised impression showing a thick fleshy envelope\r\nenclosing an oval kernel with a hard wall prolonged upwards as a longer\r\nor shorter micropyle. Casts of the seed-cavity are represented in figs.\r\n423; 424, 2, 3. The surface of these casts occasionally shows one or\r\nmore short cylindrical projections which are probably extensions of the\r\nsand or mud into holes formed in the testa by boring insects. The view\r\nthat _Trigonocarpus_ seeds are ‘obviously Palm fruits’ was not accepted\r\nby Hooker and Binney who inclined to regard them as the seeds of\r\nConifers and compared them especially with the similar nuts of _Ginkgo_\r\nseeds (_cf._ fig. 631, C). It was Mr Wild[335] who was first struck\r\nby the association of _Trigonocarpus_ and the petioles of _Medullosa_\r\n(_Myeloxylon_) and by some resemblances in structure between the testa\r\nand the hypoderm of the petioles; though, as Scott and Maslen[336]\r\npoint out, the agreement is not so close as Wild believed, his view of\r\na possible connexion between the reproductive and vegetative organs\r\nhas been confirmed. Williamson extended our knowledge of the genus by\r\nhis account of _Trigonocarpus olivaeformis_ Lind. and Hutt., a form\r\nthat is specifically identical with _T. Parkinsoni_ Brongn. This author\r\nalso drew attention to the close resemblance between Brongniart’s three\r\ngenera _Trigonocarpus_, _Hexapterospermum_, _Tripterospermum_ and\r\nexpressed doubts as to the possibility of founding specific differences\r\non casts of the _Trigonocarpus_ type without the evidence of anatomy.\r\nOur knowledge of the structure of _Trigonocarpus_ has in recent years\r\nbeen considerably extended by the researches of Oliver, Scott and\r\nMaslen, and Salisbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423. Casts of the seed-cavity of _Trigonocarpus\r\nParkinsoni_.\r\n\r\n(Manchester Museum. ½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trigonocarpus Parkinsoni_[337] Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this species like all examples of the genus are\r\nradiospermic, that is radially symmetrical in contrast to the flattened\r\nor platyspermic seeds. The complete seed is elongate oval in form when\r\npreserved as an impression (fig. 425, A) and reaches a length of 4–5\r\ncm.: the casts of the seed-cavity are ovoid and provided with three\r\nprominent ridges (fig. 424, 2, 3). The testa forms a thick covering\r\ndifferentiated into three regions, an outer flesh or sarcotesta,\r\na sclerous shell or sclerotesta, and an inner flesh. Transverse\r\nsections show that the sclerotesta has three sharp longitudinal keels\r\nwith corresponding furrows on the inner face, and between each pair\r\nof main ribs are 2–3 less prominent ridges, usually 12 in all (fig.\r\n426). The sarcotesta consists of thin-walled parenchyma passing\r\nexternally into a more lacunar tissue with a palisade-like hypoderm:\r\nthe sclerotesta consists of thick cells which interlace and form an\r\nefficient protective shell. Both the sarcotesta and sclerotesta are\r\ncontinued into the apical region as the wall of the long micropyle,\r\nthe sarcotesta being prolonged beyond the sclerotesta at the apex of\r\nthe integument[338]. The micropyle is triangular in section and may\r\nexceed in length the whole seed (figs. 425; 426, A). Its form as seen\r\nin transverse section (fig. 426, B) suggests the presence of wings:\r\nthis appearance may be deceptive and due to pressure or, more probably,\r\nit represents an original feature. The seed-body, that is the portion\r\nenclosed by the integument, consists of the nucellus, represented by a\r\nfew crushed layers of cells, bounded by a well-defined epidermis; the\r\nnucellus is separated from the integument from the base of the seed\r\nupwards, an important feature in which this and some other Palaeozoic\r\nseeds differ from _Lagenostoma_ and the seeds of recent Cycads which\r\nare characterised by an integument adnate to the nucellus up to\r\nthe level of the shoulder; the seeds of the Conifer _Phyllocladus_\r\nafford an example of separation of integument and nucellus as in\r\n_Trigonocarpus_. The innermost layer of the nucellus consists mainly\r\nof tracheal tissue investing the large megaspore (fig. 426, A, C,\r\n_m_) which is preserved as a contracted membrane detached from the\r\nnucellus after the death of the seed. At the summit of the nucellus is\r\na relatively small pollen-chamber (fig. 426, A, _Pc_) like a broad and\r\nlow cupola bearing a terminal beak which extended some distance into\r\nthe micropylar tube. No microspores have been found in this species,\r\nbut Oliver[339] records the occurrence of multicellular microspores in\r\n_Trigonocarpus pusillus_. The pedicel of the seed had a central strand\r\nof sclerous tissue penetrated by a concentric vascular bundle which\r\ngives off six strands to supply the sarcotesta (fig. 426, C, _v_) and\r\nthen passes into the nucellus where it forms a tracheal sheath (fig.\r\n426, A, _nt_) surrounding the lower part of the megaspore and at a\r\nhigher level breaks up into anastomosing strands of tracheids which\r\nreach up to the plane of insertion of the pollen-chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424. _Trigonocarpus._ 1.

Moyseyi_[341], from the Nottingham Coal-field\r\n(Middle Coal Measures), similar to _T. Parkinsoni_ but much broader\r\nin proportion to its length: this species is founded on an impression\r\nwithout structure.\r\n\r\nThe species _Trigonocarpus Dawesi_ Lind. and Hutt.[342], from the\r\nMiddle Coal Measures of Lancashire, was founded on casts differing\r\nin their large dimensions from those of _T. Parkinsoni_: specimens\r\nreferred to this species were described by Fiedler[343] from Saxony\r\nin 1857 and Lesquereux[344] figures similar casts from the Upper\r\nCarboniferous and Permian rocks of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trigonocarpus shorensis_ Salisbury.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on specimens from the Lower Coal Measures of\r\nShore, Lancashire[345], may exceed 4 cm. in length and has a breadth\r\nof 2·5 cm. In general plan it agrees with _T. Parkinsoni_ but there\r\nare certain well-marked differences: the micropyle is much shorter;\r\nthe thick sarcotesta, attaining a breadth of 6 mm. at the base of the\r\nmicropyle, is characterised by the presence of six peripherally placed\r\nvascular bundles (fig. 426, D, _v_) in contrast to the deeply embedded\r\nbundles of _T. Parkinsoni_. Below the epidermis of the sarcotesta\r\nis a hypoderm formed of radially disposed plates of sclerous tissue\r\nsimilar to that of _Myeloxylon_ and different from the palisade-like\r\nhypoderm of the type-species. Within the sarcotesta is a hard shell,\r\nthe sclerotesta, characterised by three prominent ribs extending from\r\nbase to apex and three shorter ribs which reach from the chalaza to\r\nabout a third of the length of the seed. The fact that the sarcotesta\r\nand sclerotesta pass gradually into one another is a point in favour of\r\nthe view that the integument is a single structure. There appears to be\r\ngood evidence of the restriction of an inner flesh to the micropylar\r\nregion, whereas this tissue in _T. Parkinsoni_ was probably continuous\r\nover the whole inner face of the sclerotesta. The sarcotesta is\r\nlacunar in its outer part as in some other types of Palaeozoic seeds,\r\na feature probably connected with floating efficiency. _Trigonocarpus\r\nshorensis_ occurs in association with _Myeloxylon_ petioles, and there\r\nis a resemblance between the seed and the vegetative organs in the\r\nstructure of the hypoderm as also in the structure of the secretory\r\nsacs which are particularly numerous in this species. Salisbury draws\r\nattention to the close resemblance between the form of _T. shorensis_\r\nand the seeds found in organic connexion with pinnae of _Neuropteris\r\nobliqua_[346].\r\n\r\nThe species _T. corrugatus_ described by Renault[347] bears a close\r\nresemblance to _T. shorensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Other Genera founded in part on Reproductive Organs which may belong\r\n    to the Medulloseae.+\r\n\r\n=Codonotheca=, =Schützia=, =Whittleseya=, =Dolerophyllum=, =Ottokaria=,\r\n    =Strobilites=.\r\n\r\n=CODONOTHECA.= Sellards.\r\n\r\n_Codonotheca caduca_ Sellards. This genus was founded on some\r\nspore-bearing bodies from the Coal Measures of Illinois[348]:\r\nnothing is known as to the plant which bore them, but Sellards is\r\ninclined to associate them with _Neuropteris decipiens_ Lesq.[349], a\r\nspecies abundant in the same coal-field. Whatever may have been the\r\nparent-plant it is probable, as the author of the genus believes, that\r\n_Codonotheca_ is the microspore-bearing organ of a Pteridosperm. As\r\nshown in fig. 427, 5, the form is that of a stalked cup consisting in\r\nthe basal portion of a stout axis, the peripheral tissue of which is\r\nbelieved to have been fleshy, containing an axial rod of conducting\r\ntissue running up to the floor of the cup, _c_, and then dividing into\r\nsix vascular strands, each of which forks into two branches. The upper\r\npart is composed of six linear segments united basally to form the\r\nsloping surface of the cup. On the inner face of each segment is a more\r\nor less well-defined depression covered with large elliptical spores\r\n·29–·31 mm. long by ·18–·19 mm. broad (fig. 427, 6, 8). The presence of\r\na median ridge (fig. 427, 8) indicates a bilateral origin. ‘There is\r\nno grouping of the spores or other indication of the location of the\r\nsporangia, which were doubtless more or less completely immersed in the\r\ntissue, the dividing wall disappearing at maturity.’ The spores are\r\nseen in fig. 427, 2, 3, on the inner face of the lobes. Some of the\r\nspecimens have a fairly long pedicel: in the example shown in fig. 427,\r\n1, the fleshy part of the basal portion is not preserved, only the more\r\nresistant vascular core. In a later account of these organs Sellards\r\nspeaks of several lying by the side of a central stalk to which he\r\nthinks they were originally attached by slender pedicels. In view of\r\nDr Benson’s interpretation of the morphology of _Telangium_ it is\r\npermissible to suggest that if a central sporangium in such a synangium\r\nas that of _Codonotheca_ developed a megaspore and the peripheral\r\nsporogenous lobes were sterilised, the result would be an arrangement\r\nnot unlike the apical region of the seed _Physostoma_, the tentacles\r\nof which have been homologised with the canopy of _Lagenostoma_.\r\nThere are obvious difficulties in the way of this, perhaps strained,\r\ncomparison: the larger size of the spore-bearing linear segments of\r\n_Codonotheca_ led Sellards to regard each as a synangium rather than\r\na single sporangium. But precise information as to the structure of\r\nthe American fossils is not as yet available. If the association of\r\n_Codonotheca_ with _Neuropteris_ fronds has any significance it would\r\nfavour a reference of these organs to the Medulloseae. In the absence\r\nof anatomical data it is impossible in some cases to distinguish\r\nmicrospore-bearing organs of the _Codonotheca_ type from small seeds\r\nenclosed in a lobed cupule or even seeds with a lobed integument:\r\na case in point is the New Brunswick species _Pterispermostrobus\r\nbifurcatus_ Stopes[350].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427. _Codonotheca caduca_. 1.

(After Sellards.)]\r\n\r\nA Spitzbergen, Culm, fossil recently described by Nathorst[351] as\r\n_Codonotheca (?) pusilla_ is briefly referred to under the genus\r\n_Pterispermostrobus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SCHÜTZIA.= Geinitz.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Geinitz[352] for some Permian\r\nfossils obtained by Bergmeister Schütz and regarded by the author of\r\nthe genus as probably fertile branches of some Conifer. A more complete\r\naccount was published by Goeppert[353] in his ‘Permian Flora,’ where\r\nthe name _Anthodiopsis Beinertiana_ occurs on the Plates, printed\r\nbefore the publication of Geinitz’s description, but in the text the\r\nspecimens are referred to _Schützia anomala_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schützia anomala_ Geinitz.\r\n\r\nThe type-species, recorded from Bohemia and Silesia, is represented\r\nby fertile shoots consisting of a thick main axis bearing apparently\r\ntwo-ranked though probably spirally disposed short lateral branches,\r\neach of which terminates in a receptacle with numerous crowded\r\nlinear-lanceolate bracts superficially resembling a partially expanded\r\ninflorescence of a Composite. Goeppert believed that the branches\r\nbore seeds and he refers to this species a number of detached,\r\nlongitudinally striated and bluntly terminated, seeds. The same author\r\ndescribes other specimens from the same localities associated with\r\n_Schützia anomala_, which he names _Dictyothalamus Schrollianus_[354]:\r\nin habit these agree closely with _Schützia_ but the receptacles,\r\nthe reticulate appearance of which suggested the generic name\r\n_Dictyothalamus_, bear a large number of small bodies regarded as\r\nseeds. The preservation of the fossils is not such as to enable us to\r\ndetermine their true nature but it is probable that _Schützia_ and\r\n_Dictyothalamus_ are not generically distinct. In his description of\r\n_Dictyothalamus_ Goeppert suggests that the two associated types may\r\nbe the male and female shoots of one plant, but he speaks of seeds in\r\nboth cases. Schimper[355], who unites _Dictyothalamus_ with _Schützia_,\r\nregards the latter as female and the former as male.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schützia Bennieana_ Kidston.\r\n\r\nThis species, described by Kidston[356] from the Calciferous series of\r\nScotland, differs from _S. anomala_ in its much more slender axis and\r\nin the relatively narrower and less globular clusters of bract-like\r\nappendages. The principal axis bears three lateral branches with\r\nterminal clusters of acute and narrow linear scale-leaves. No seeds\r\nwere found in association with the specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schützia permiensis_ (Renault).\r\n\r\nRenault founded this Permian species as _Antholithus permiensis_[357]\r\non a specimen from Lodève; it consists of an incomplete inflorescence\r\n6·4 cm. long bearing four lateral branches with stalks 1·5 to 2 cm.\r\nlong terminated by clusters of small oval bracts 5 mm. long. Renault\r\ncompares the fossil with the recent Conifers _Glyptostrobus_ and\r\n_Tsuga_, but it exhibits a much closer resemblance to _Schützia\r\nanomala_.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Schützia_, originally described from Permian strata, is\r\nrecorded also from Westphalian strata in North Africa[358] as well\r\nas from Lower Carboniferous rocks in Scotland. The data at present\r\navailable are insufficient to determine the morphological nature of the\r\nfertile branches: the evidence adduced by Goeppert in support of the\r\noccurrence of seeds is not convincing and the interpretation of the\r\nbract-like appendages is still an open question; they may have formed\r\na cupular investment to seeds, but in the Scotch species the general\r\nappearance rather suggests that they may be microspore-bearing organs\r\ncomparable with those of _Codonotheca_[359]. There are no adequate\r\ngrounds for supposing _Schützia_ to belong to the Coniferales, a view\r\nadvanced by some authors; it is much more likely to represent the\r\nfertile shoots of a Pteridosperm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WHITTLESEYA=. Newberry.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Whittleseya_, referred by many authors to the _Ginkgoales_,\r\nhas no substantial claim to be regarded as allied to that group: its\r\nposition is still uncertain, but the recent discovery of fertile\r\nspecimens suggests the probability of a relationship to _Potoniea_ and\r\nan identification of Whittleseya as another form of microsporophyll of\r\na Pteridosperm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 428.\r\n\r\n  A, C. _Whittleseya elegans_.

C, diagrammatic sketch of part\r\n        of a leaflet showing the teeth, the striated texture of the\r\n        carbonised layer, and the vein-like markings on a lower\r\n        surface. (After Thomas; enlarged.)\r\n  B. _Whittleseya brevifolia_. (After White; the smaller figure ⅚ nat.\r\n        size.)]\r\n\r\nThe generic name was given by Newberry[360] to some leaves, or possibly\r\nleaflets, originally described by C. Whittlesey from the Coal Measures\r\nof Ohio. Whittleseya is represented by species from several North\r\nAmerican localities[361] in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Nova Scotia,\r\nand New Brunswick[362]; it occurs in Silesia and has recently been\r\nfound in the English Coal Measures[363]. The genus is confined to Upper\r\nCarboniferous strata.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are fairly thick; the lamina is oblong, cuneate, broadly\r\ntriangular or linear, usually rounded and truncate (fig. 428, A,\r\nC), generally dentate at the distal end, the proximal portion being\r\ngradually or abruptly contracted and occasionally prolonged into a\r\nshort pedicel. The veins or ribs are parallel to the sides of the\r\nlamina and except near the base unbranched.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whittleseya elegans_ Newberry.\r\n\r\nThe type-species, from North America and Europe, is characterised\r\nby its shovel-like lamina from 3 to 6 cm. long closely resembling\r\nin shape some lepidopterous scales; the surface is ribbed, each rib\r\ncorresponding to a tooth on the distal margin; on each of the parallel\r\nridges are 4–5 longitudinal lines indicating either veins or stereome\r\nstrands (fig. 428, A, C). The examination of preparations made by\r\nDr Kidston from a leaflet of this species enables me to add a few\r\nfacts with regard to the microspores. The spores, which cover almost\r\nthe whole surface of the lamina, show a tendency to a more or less\r\ndefinite arrangement in longitudinal rows. Two types of cuticularised\r\nmembrane are represented among the associated fragments: in some\r\npieces of cuticle the cells are short and have straight walls while\r\nin others the preservation is inferior and the cells appear to be\r\nlonger and narrower. One or both of these membranes probably belong\r\nto the sporangia. The oval slit, which is a striking feature on\r\nseveral of the spores (fig. 429), points to their bilateral nature\r\nand dehiscence along the major axis. A comparison of these spores\r\nwith those obtained by Kidston from the English species _Whittleseya\r\nfertilis_ reveals a very close agreement both in size and shape and\r\nconfirms the identification of the Staffordshire specimens as leaflets\r\nof _Whittleseya_. The large size of the microspores and the gaping oval\r\naperture in some of them are features in which they agree closely with\r\nthe spores of _Dolerophyllum fertile_ described by Renault[364]. In\r\nboth cases the spores tend to be arranged in long groups and they are\r\npractically identical in form and in the nature of the exine; those\r\nof _Dolerophyllum_ are 280μ long while those of _W. fertilis_ reach\r\na length of 220μ. In some of the _Whittleseya_ spores the exine has\r\nsplit as in the specimen shown in fig. 429, but in others there are two\r\ncurved lines along which dehiscence has begun, a character in which the\r\nspores appear to be identical with those of _Dolerophyllum_ described\r\nby Renault who speaks of dehiscence by means of an operculum. There\r\nis, I venture to think, little doubt as to the very close affinity\r\nof the two types. The systematic position of _Dolerophyllum_ is not\r\ncertainly established; if the generic identity of the leaves described\r\nas _D. Berthieri_ Ren. and the petrified specimens named _D. fertile_\r\nis assumed, it is a legitimate inference that the genus is founded on\r\nfertile pinnules of a Pteridosperm with foliage of the _Neuropteris_\r\nor _Cyclopteris_ form. It would seem probable that both _Whittleseya_\r\nand _Dolerophyllum_ _fertile_ are microspore-bearing leaflets of\r\nPteridosperms, possibly of some Medullosan plants. The leaflets of\r\n_Whittleseya_ agree in form fairly closely with those of _Potoniea\r\nadiantiformis_ Zeill. described on a previous page[365] as the male\r\norgans of a Pteridosperm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429. Microspores of _Whittleseya elegans_. A, a\r\ngroup of spores; B, a single spore. (Preparations made from an American\r\nspecimen, No. 2314, in Dr Kidston’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe specimens described by Lesquereux from Pennsylvania as _W.\r\nintegrifolia_ and _W. undulata_ are less satisfactory than _W.\r\nelegans_. The Arkansas species _W. microphylla_[366], characterised\r\nby the obcuneate form of the lamina, is said to occur not only as\r\ndetached leaflets but in loose bunches at the ends of slender axes,\r\na circumstance favourable to the suggestion, based on the recently\r\ndescribed English specimens, that the _Whittleseya_ leaves may\r\nbe fertile pinnules of a Pteridosperm frond. Among other species\r\nattributed to Newberry’s genus is _W. brevifolia_ Wh. from Nova\r\nScotia[367] with much smaller broadly triangular leaves 7 mm. long\r\nexclusive of the petiole and 8 mm. broad at the distal end (fig.\r\n428, B). Dr Matthew[368] has also described a Canadian species _W.\r\nconcinna_ from New Brunswick in beds assigned by Dr Stopes[369] to the\r\nWestphalian series.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whittleseya fertilis_ Kidston.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of _Whittleseya elegans_ in the Coal Measures\r\nof Staffordshire recorded by Mr Thomas, Dr Kidston has published\r\nan account of some specimens from the same district under the name\r\n_Whittleseya (?) fertilis_[370]: these consist of smaller cuneate\r\nscale-leaves or leaflets 1·4–2·4 cm. long and 8–9 mm. broad; the\r\nlamina has a dentate upper margin and is longitudinally ribbed. The\r\nscales occur in superposed pairs, closely fitting but not organically\r\nconnected, at least in the state in which they are preserved; each\r\npair forms a sporangium-like case enclosing numerous spores but the\r\nactual sporangia or synangia have not been preserved. Kidston describes\r\nthe spores as 210–222μ in length, elliptical, and characterised in\r\nmany cases by an oval slit; they are practically identical with the\r\nmicrospores of _W. elegans_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DOLEROPHYLLUM=. Saporta.\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed[371] primarily for a large ovoid petrified\r\nbud composed of rolled Cyclopteroid leaves from Permian rocks in the\r\nUral Mountains, which had been previously described by more than one\r\nwriter under different names and regarded as a young shoot of a Palm\r\nor other Monocotyledon. Eichwald[372], who published good drawings,\r\ncalled the fossil _Noeggerathia Goepperti_. Saporta connected with this\r\nspecies some leaf-impressions from the Permian of Bohemia described\r\nby Goeppert[373] as _Noeggerathia cyclopteroides_: in his family\r\nDolerophylleae[374] the French author included other leaves which\r\nare probably not closely related to the type-species, _Dolerophyllum\r\nGoepperti_. The Dolerophylleae are spoken of by Saporta and Marion[375]\r\nas Progymnosperms. Before the publication of Saporta’s note Grand’Eury\r\nhad instituted the genus _Doleropteris_[376] and the family\r\nDoleropteroideae; in the former he included several forms of leaves\r\nagreeing generally with Goeppert’s _Noeggerathia cyclopteroides_.\r\nZeiller[377] adopts Grand’Eury’s designation for the Russian fossil in\r\npreference to _Dolerophyllum_, a choice justified by considerations of\r\npriority; but the latter name is retained in this account as it was\r\nassigned by Saporta to the specimen of greatest botanical interest,\r\nnamely _Dolerophyllum Goepperti_, and because it does not suggest\r\naffinity to Ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dolerophyllum Goepperti_ (Eichwald).\r\n\r\nThe type-species is from the Zechstein of Orenburg in the Urals and\r\nno specimens having precisely the same structure have been found\r\nelsewhere. Eichwald assigned it, with leaf-impressions of various\r\nkinds, to the Noeggerathieae and named it _Noeggerathia Goepperti_: it\r\nhad previously been described by Kutorga[378] as _Aroides crassispatha_\r\nand Unger[379] included it among the Palms as _Palaeospathe aroidea_.\r\nThe species has been described also by Saporta and Marion and by\r\nRenault[380]. The following account is based on sections cut from a\r\nspecimen in the British Museum[381] which, though assigned on the label\r\n(within a query) to France and named _Dolerophyllum Berthieri_, is\r\nundoubtedly Eichwald’s species from East Russia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430. _Dolerophyllum Goepperti_. Bud in\r\nsurface-view, A; in longitudinal section, B, C; in transverse section,\r\nD. (British Museum; A, ⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe specimen (fig. 430) is 9 cm. long and 4·2 cm. broad: at the\r\nslightly contracted and broken base is a piece of immature axis (fig.\r\n430, B, _a_) 12 mm. in diameter overtopped by a mass of closely packed\r\nleaves encircling one another like the bulb-scales of an Onion (fig.\r\n430 A, C)[382]. Most of the leaves included in the bud were attached\r\nto the axis below the broken base. The curved, dichotomously branched,\r\nveins are seen on some of the pieces of lamina on the surface of\r\nthe bud (fig. 430, A). The considerable breadth of the leaves is\r\ndemonstrated by the longitudinal and transverse sections. In fig. C\r\nmost of the laminae can be traced through the whole height of each\r\nof the steep-sided arches: a few overlapping margins are seen in\r\nfig. D. The veins are for the most part imperfectly preserved and\r\nappear as clear spaces at regular intervals in the brown mesophyll.\r\nThe axis of the shoot consists of homogeneous parenchyma except near\r\nthe sloping sides where narrow dark bands (fig. 430, B, _a_) mark\r\nthe position of desmogen-strands of thin-walled elongated elements\r\nrepresenting an early stage in the development of vascular bundles\r\nsome of which have already produced spiral tracheids. Short secretory\r\ncells accompany the immature conducting elements. The lamina slightly\r\nexceeds 2 mm. in thickness in the broadest part: the mesophyll is\r\ncomposed of large parenchymatous cells of elliptical or spherical\r\nform often loosely attached owing to the well-developed system of\r\nintercellular spaces. The lower epidermis, assuming that the outer\r\nface of the rolled leaves is the morphologically lower surface, forms\r\na uniform layer of palisade cells characterised by their free conical\r\nends (fig. 431, A, B, _e_) which in some oblique sections appear as\r\nsharply pointed papillae with almost filiform apices; but while the\r\ncells were doubtless papillose like those of the epidermis of a velvety\r\npetal, the pointed form is due in part to the greater distinctness of\r\nthe dark contents as compared with the lighter cell-walls. The upper\r\nepidermis is much less distinct; it consists of smaller flattened\r\ncells with occasional stomata. Renault[383] figures a specimen with\r\nstomata in a better state of preservation. The vascular bundles are\r\nrendered conspicuous by large secretory cells on the lower side, in\r\nthe larger veins in the form of an arc or irregular group (fig. 432,\r\nA), but in the finer veins as single cells (fig. 431, A, B). These\r\nsacs resemble the tannin cells accompanying the veins in a leaf of\r\n_Ginkgo_ (_cf._ fig. 631, G). The xylem-elements are of two kinds,\r\n(i) elongated spiral and scalariform conducting elements, forming a\r\nvertical plate of a few rows in the larger veins (figs. 431, 432) or a\r\nsmall compact group in the more slender veins (fig. 413, A, B); (ii)\r\nmuch larger isodiametric cells with reticulate or spiral thickening\r\nresembling the transfusion-tracheids of Conifers or, perhaps more\r\nclosely, similar elements in the leaves of _Lepidodendron_. These short\r\ntracheids are especially abundant on the flanks of the conducting\r\ntracheids (figs. 431, _t_; 432, A, _t_), but they sometimes form a\r\ncomplete investment. In the obliquely cut vein reproduced in fig. 431,\r\nD, the transfusion-tracheids are abundant: a few are enlarged in fig.\r\n431, E. In the smaller veins (fig. 431, A, B) they are represented by\r\nthe larger elements, _t_, on the sides of the conducting strands. The\r\nprotoxylem lies close to the upper edge in the middle line (_px_, figs.\r\n431, A; 432, A); it is difficult to determine its precise position,\r\nbut it would seem to be slightly internal, the bundle being not quite\r\nendarch. No phloem was recognised in the British Museum specimen, but\r\nit presumably occurred, if present, where the black patch is shown\r\nin fig. 432, A. Renault describes some phloem in sections which he\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431. _Dolerophyllum Goepperti_. Transverse\r\nsections of leaves. _e_, epidermis; _s_, secretory cells; _t_,\r\ntransfusion-tracheids; _px_, protoxylem. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe mesophyll next the upper surface is in most cases represented\r\nby spaces between the veins which give a crenulated outline to the\r\nparenchyma (fig. 430, C, D); in some places the spaces contain remains\r\nof very loose and crowded cells suggesting the original presence of\r\nvery lacunar tissue or possibly of thin-walled storage-cells. The\r\nconfinement of stomata to what is assumed to be the upper surface may,\r\nas Renault and others have suggested, indicate leaves which floated on\r\nwater, an inference opposed to the view that the gaps in the mesophyll\r\nmark the position of water-tissue.\r\n\r\nNo specimens have been described which enable us to correlate with\r\ncertainty mature leaves or foliage-shoots with the petrified bud.\r\nIt is, however, not improbable that the impression from Mount Pelé\r\nnear Epinac named by Renault _Dolerophyllum Berthieri_[384] may be\r\ncorrectly referred to the same genus. The type-specimen consists of\r\nan axis, whether a rachis of a compound leaf or a shoot with simple\r\nleaves cannot be determined, bearing partially overlapping more or less\r\norbicular leaves 18–20 cm. in diameter, with a _Cyclopteris_ venation.\r\nAmong other leaves of unknown affinity referred to the same genus\r\nattention is drawn to _Dolerophyllum pseudopeltatum_ (Grand’Eury)[385]\r\nwith an orbicular lamina reaching in some specimens 22 × 19 cm.\r\nSpecimens of _Dolerophyllum pseudopeltatum_ are figured by Renault\r\nfrom the Commentry coal-field[386], some of which reach a diameter\r\nof 12 cm. The only British specimen of a leaflet of this type which\r\nI have seen is one in Dr Kidston’s collection from the Stephanian\r\nseries, Glamorganshire. It is probable that some at least of the\r\nimpressions assigned to _Dolerophyllum_ or _Doleropteris_ would be more\r\nappropriately included in _Cyclopteris_ or _Cardiopteris_ and may have\r\nbeen borne on the axis of large Pteridosperm fronds. Grand’Eury[387]\r\nhas also called attention to the difficulty of distinguishing the\r\nlarger _Cyclopteris_ leaflets from _Dolerophyllum_. Some of the\r\nCyclopteroid leaflets figured by Roehl[388] on _Neuropteris_ fronds\r\ndiffer but slightly from those of _D. pseudopeltatum_. The shoot\r\nshowing large leaf-scars figured by Saporta and Marion[389] as probably\r\nthe axis of a _Dolerophyllum_ may well be a piece of _Cordaites_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432. A. _Dolerophyllum Goepperti_, section of\r\nvein. B. _Dolerophyllum Berthieri_; _s_, microspores. C. _Dolerophyllum\r\nfertile_. D. _Dolerophyllum fertile_, microspores. (After Renault.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Microsporophylls assigned to_ Dolerophyllum.\r\n\r\nCertain problematical fossils found in association with the sterile\r\nleaves of _Dolerophyllum Berthieri_ have been described by Renault as\r\nthe male organs of that species. These are elliptical discs, 6 × 5 cm.,\r\nwith an excentrically placed stalk: embedded in a carbonised lamina are\r\nnumerous rows of elliptical bodies, 410μ × 280μ, characterised by two\r\ncurved longitudinal grooves on the surface and regarded by Renault as\r\npollen-grains. The chains of these microspores radiate outwards from\r\nthe neighbourhood of the stalk and cover most of the surface of the\r\ndisc (fig. 432, B). Some silicified pieces of similar spore-bearing\r\ndiscs from Grand’ Croix named _Dolerophyllum fertile_[390] afford\r\nadditional information as to these remarkable reproductive organs.\r\nThe earlier account of this species by Renault is confirmed by\r\nSolms-Laubach[391] who examined the original sections. The peltate\r\nfleshy discs preserved as incomplete specimens consist of lacunar\r\nparenchyma 15–18 mm. thick traversed at right angles to the surface\r\nby numerous loculi (fig. 432, C), circular or oval in transverse\r\nsection, containing large numbers of microspores, _s_, similar in size\r\nand form to those on the carbonised discs of the Mt Pelé specimen.\r\nVascular strands occur between and parallel to the spore-chambers.\r\nThe spores contain 8–10 cells (fig. 432, D) and Renault believes that\r\ndehiscence of the exine occurred along the two deep grooves which mark\r\nthe limits of an operculum. He emphasises the peculiar structure of\r\nthe microspores by speaking of them as prepollinia: in size and in\r\nthe presence of internal cells (? male prothallus) they resemble the\r\nspores found in the pollen-chamber of a seed described by Renault as\r\n_Aetheotesta elliptica_[392] which he thinks may belong to a member of\r\nthe Dolerophylleae. It has also been suggested that _Codonospermum_ may\r\nbe a seed of _Dolerophyllum_[393]. An unconvincing specimen described\r\nby Saporta and Marion[394] as a seed-bearing bract is regarded by them\r\nas referable to _Dolerophyllum_, but the evidence for any connexion is\r\nfar from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing definite to be said with regard to the affinity of\r\n_Dolerophyllum Goepperti_ or the microsporophylls represented by _D.\r\nfertile_ and the specimens associated with _D. Berthieri_. Renault\r\nconsiders that both sterile and fertile specimens belong to the same\r\ngenus, which he assigns to a position between Pteridophytes and\r\nCycads. As Solms-Laubach says, the evidence supplied by the structure\r\nof the veins of _D. Goepperti_ in favour of a cycadean alliance is\r\nnot convincing. The type of vernation is unlike that of any known\r\nCycad or indeed of any Gymnosperm: the large size of the leaves is\r\nanother though weaker objection to this comparison, as the pinnae of\r\n_Bowenia_ (fig. 391) and especially those of some species of _Zamia_\r\n(fig. 388), are of equal or larger dimensions. If, as seems probable,\r\nthe xylem-strands are mesarch that is a point of contact with recent\r\nCycads, but the bundle as a whole bears but a remote resemblance to\r\nthat of a cycadean leaf and is much more like the veins of _Ginkgo_.\r\nThe bud shown in fig. 430, A, is probably a young shoot and not merely\r\na large compound leaf. If it were an unexpanded frond of _Neuropteris_\r\nbearing _Cyclopteris_ pinnules we should expect to find indications\r\nof scattered desmogen-strands such as would occur in the _Myeloxylon_\r\ntype of rachis. The resemblance to most forms of _Cordaites_ is by no\r\nmeans close though a few leaves referred to that genus (_e.g._ _C.\r\ncircularis_, fig. 468, B) are similar to those of _Dolerophyllum_[395].\r\n\r\nThe male organs are unlike those of any other plant: they may be\r\ndescribed as sporophylls with microsporangia or perhaps synangia\r\nembedded in the mesophyll and containing microspores similar to those\r\nof some Pteridosperms or true Gymnosperms. Attention has been called to\r\nthe close resemblance of the spores shown in fig. 432, C, D to those\r\nrecently discovered by Kidston and referred to the genus _Whittleseya_\r\n(fig. 429), and it is very probable that the striking similarity is an\r\nindex of affinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ottokaria.= Zeiller.\r\n\r\n_Ottokaria bengalensis_ Zeiller. A specimen of doubtful affinity\r\nfrom the Lower Gondwana (Karharbari beds) of Passerabhia, India, was\r\noriginally described by Zeiller[396] as _Feistmantelia bengalensis_,\r\nbut in a postscript he substituted the name _Ottokaria_ on the ground\r\nthat _Feistmantelia_ had previously been employed by Lester Ward.\r\nFig. 433 is drawn from the original specimen: it consists of a stalk\r\nattached in a slightly excentric position to an almost orbicular\r\nlamina, 2·5 cm. in diameter, with subacute marginal teeth and traversed\r\nby numerous radially disposed striations. Zeiller compares the fossil\r\nwith _Whittleseya elegans_ and _Rhipidopsis ginkgoides_ and assigns\r\nit with some hesitation to the Salisburieae. An examination of the\r\ntype-specimen led me to form the opinion that it may be a cupular organ\r\nof a Pteridosperm that enclosed a seed. The lamina is slightly concave\r\nand has the form of a shallow cup; moreover the surface-features\r\nresemble those of a bract rather than the regularly veined lamina of\r\na foliage-leaf. The specimen bears a very close resemblance to one\r\nfigured by Bertrand[397] as the cupule of _Hexapterospermum modestae_\r\nwhich he connects with fronds of _Neuropteris gigantea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433. _Ottokaria bengalensis._ (Nat. size; drawn\r\nfrom the type-specimen.)]\r\n\r\n_Ottokaria_ occurs in association with fronds of _Glossopteris indica_\r\nand with the large seeds described by Zeiller[398] as _Cardiocarpus\r\nindicus_. I have lately obtained some evidence in favour of\r\nassigning Feistmantel’s seeds _Carpolithes Milleri_[399] to the genus\r\n_Glossopteris_: among several specimens from the Lower Gondwana rocks\r\nof India I found an example showing a seed partially covered by a\r\nscale-leaf in its natural position which appears to be identical with\r\nscale-leaves of _Glossopteris_. It may be that the specimen represented\r\nin fig. 433 belongs to _Cardiocarpus indicus_, though this is a mere\r\nguess: my belief is that _Ottokaria_ is a cupular organ that enclosed\r\nthe base of a seed borne on a Pteridosperm. There is little doubt that\r\nas additional data are obtained it will be found that Pteridosperms\r\nplayed no inconsiderable part in the vegetation of Gondwana Land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 434. _Strobilites Milleryensis._ (Natural size;\r\nafter Renault.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strobilites.= Schimper and Mougeot.\r\n\r\n_Strobilites Milleryensis_ (Renault).\r\n\r\nThis species, from the Permian of France, was placed by Renault in\r\n_Cycadospadix_[400], but having regard to the fact that it differs\r\nessentially in habit from Mesozoic examples of that genus the\r\nprovisional name _Strobilites_[401] is suggested. The type-specimens\r\nare long and narrow spikes or loose strobili, 8–16 cm. long and 2–2·6\r\ncm. broad; a stout axis bears spirally disposed bracts 8–10 mm. long\r\nattached by a slender decurrent pedicel expanded distally into a\r\nfan-shaped laciniate lamina with a convex upper face, and there are\r\nsaid to be two seeds attached to the sides of each pedicel (fig. 434).\r\nThe oval seeds appear to be platyspermic and resemble _Samaropsis\r\nfluitans_ Daws. Two of the strobili figured by Renault are attached\r\nat right angles to a second axis, a habit suggesting comparison with\r\nthat of a large compound frond. Renault is inclined to regard these\r\nfertile shoots as cycadean and suggests a possible connexion with the\r\nPermian stems _Ptychoxylon_ or _Poroxylon_, both of which are known\r\nto have produced fairly numerous branches. In habit the spikes are\r\nsimilar to some of the longer examples of _Cordaianthus_, but their\r\npreservation is not sufficiently good to afford accurate information as\r\nto the relation of seed to sporophyll. _Strobilites Milleryensis_ is,\r\nperhaps, more likely to be the fertile branch of a compound frond of a\r\nPteridosperm, and it is significant that the seeds have been found in\r\nassociation with _Callipteris_ leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COLPOXYLON=. Brongniart.\r\n\r\n_Colpoxylon aeduense_ Brongniart. The genus was founded by\r\nBrongniart[402] on a piece of stem 15 cm. in diameter from the\r\nPermian of the Autun district and regarded by him as a distinct\r\ntype, with certain resemblances to recent Cycads. A thick section in\r\nthe British Museum, 13 cm. in diameter (fig. 435, A), illustrates\r\nthe main anatomical features described by Renault[403], to whom our\r\nknowledge of the genus is chiefly due. There are two large steles of\r\nirregular outline closely resembling those of _Medullosa Leuckarti_\r\n(_cf._ fig. 416, H); each consists of a band of secondary xylem with\r\nbroad medullary rays and a narrow zone of phloem enclosing a central\r\nregion composed of parenchyma, in which strands of primary tracheids,\r\nboth reticulate and spiral, pursue a more or less horizontal course,\r\nassociated with a few small groups of vertical xylem-strands at the\r\ninner edge of the secondary wood. The manoxylic nature of the wood is\r\nclearly shown in fig. 436; the continuous ink-line marks the position\r\nof the cambium and the dots show the internal protoxylem. Homogeneous\r\nparenchyma surrounds the steles and beyond this is crushed tissue\r\ncontaining large secretory canals and nests of stereome fibres either\r\nas separate groups or in contact with the canals (fig. 435, C). In the\r\nsame peripheral tissue occur scattered collateral vascular bundles\r\n(fig. 435, D) identical with those of _Myeloxylon_. The outer cortex\r\nof the stem is marked off from the more homogeneous inner region by\r\na fairly distinct line where there is some indication of periderm.\r\nThe anatomical features are clearly shown in fig. 436, a photograph\r\nfrom a section in Dr Kidston’s collection. At _a_ is an imperfectly\r\npreserved vascular bundle with a crescentic group of secondary xylem\r\nwhich is probably a leaf-trace that has just emerged from the secondary\r\ncylinder. Renault speaks of these more or less circular strands as\r\npossibly connected with reproductive shoots, but it is more probable\r\nthat they are homologous with the strands in the pericycle and inner\r\ncortex of _Medullosa_ and represent leaf-traces before division into\r\nsmaller collateral strands. Renault describes the stem as possessing\r\nseven vascular cylinders in the apical region and suggests branching\r\nof the main axis as the cause of the increase in number: there is,\r\nhowever, no evidence to support such correlation. The two steles seen\r\nin fig. 435, A, become merged at a lower level into a single stele of\r\nsinuous form (fig. 435, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435. _Colpoxylon aeduense_. A.

Transverse section\r\nof half of the stem; _a_, stele of branch. Slightly enlarged. (Kidston\r\nColl., 1946.)]\r\n\r\nBeyond the facts furnished by the leaf-trace bundles in the outer\r\ncortex and the occurrence of two large scars about 5 cm. in breadth on\r\na stem figured by Renault, we have no positive information as to the\r\nform of the leaves or the structure of the reproductive organs. There\r\nis little doubt that the fronds were large and compound like those of\r\nmost species of _Medullosa_. There is, however, some slight evidence\r\nthat _Alethopteris Grandini_ Brongn. and seeds of the _Pachytesta_ type\r\n(fig. 497) were borne on _Colpoxylon_ stems; this rests solely on the\r\nassociation in the Loire coal-basin[404] of _Alethopteris_ fronds with\r\nstems presenting structural resemblances to _Colpoxylon aeduense_.\r\n\r\nThe striking resemblance between _Colpoxylon_ and _Medullosa\r\nLeuckarti_ has led certain authors[405] to propose the substitution of\r\n_Medullosa_ for _Colpoxylon_. The resemblances though close are hardly\r\nsufficient to warrant this course. In _Colpoxylon_ the stelar system\r\nis simpler; there is no central region with star- or plate-rings as\r\nin _Medullosa Leuckarti_ but, as in _Medullosa anglica_, the vascular\r\ntissue consists only of large steles without a medullary system.\r\n_Colpoxylon_ differs from _M. anglica_ in the reduction in some parts\r\nof the stem of the vascular system to a single stele and, moreover, the\r\nprimary portion of the steles is much more parenchymatous in structure\r\nand contains more irregularly anastomosing tracheal strands than is the\r\ncase in _M. anglica_.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in the pattern formed by the vascular system at\r\ndifferent levels in some Medullosan stems, especially in _Colpoxylon_,\r\nmay be compared with the varying disposition of the vascular strands\r\nin the thick dorsiventral rhizomes of _Polypodium heracleum_ Kunz. and\r\n_P. quercifolium_ L. In the rhizome of _P. heracleum_ there are two\r\nvascular systems, an outer, cortical, system in the form of a hollow\r\ncylinder composed of a lattice-work with polygonal meshes from which\r\nbranches are given off to the roots, and a more complex medullary\r\nsystem that is concerned with the emission of leaf-traces. As shown\r\nby a series of drawings reproduced in an account by Klein[406] of the\r\nanatomy of these species of _Polypodium_, the inner system of steles\r\nconsists of two cylinders connected towards the upper surface of the\r\nstem by a rounded arch of vascular strands; nearer the leaf-base the\r\ntwo cylinders meet and eventually a larger cylinder is produced partly\r\nfrom the upper halves of the two cylinders of the previous section\r\nand in part from the connecting arch: the remains of the two smaller\r\ncylinders become connected with the outer vascular system. These and\r\nother changes suggest comparison with _Colpoxylon_ as also with the\r\nstelar changes in the stem of _Ptychoxylon_. The comparison cannot\r\nbe carried beyond the grosser features and is chiefly interesting as\r\naffording a further illustration of a similarity in plan between some\r\nrecent Ferns and extinct Pteridosperms and other Palaeozoic genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437. _Rhexoxylon africanum_. Transverse section\r\nof stem showing peripheral steles and central (_c_) stele. (After\r\nBancroft; × 2.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=RHEXOXYLON=. Bancroft.\r\n\r\n_Rhexoxylon africanum_ Bancroft. The genus _Rhexoxylon_ was instituted\r\nfor a new type of stem represented by a single incomplete specimen\r\nfrom the Karroo series of South Africa: its precise geological\r\nhorizon is not known but it may be referred provisionally to the\r\nlower or Palaeozoic portion of the series. Though our knowledge of\r\nthe morphological features of the type-species is far from complete\r\nowing in part to the method of preservation of the specimen and in\r\npart to the destruction of the outer portion of the vascular tissue\r\nand the whole of the cortex, Miss Bancroft’s careful description[407]\r\ndemonstrates the existence of characters which justify the employment\r\nof a new generic name. _Rhexoxylon_ is more nearly related to the\r\nMedulloseae than to any other group and is particularly interesting as\r\nthe first recorded example of this group from the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nFig. 437 shows a transverse section (7 × 5 cm.) of the stem. The\r\nground-tissue consists of fairly large-celled parenchyma with sclerous\r\nnests and a few bands of periderm. At the periphery of the stem are\r\nradially disposed groups of vascular tissue varying in size and to\r\nsome extent in shape. Unfortunately the stem is incomplete and it is\r\nimpossible to say how much vascular or other tissue originally existed\r\nbeyond the present corroded edge. The vascular groups, or steles as\r\nthey may legitimately be called, follow a vertical course through\r\nthe length of the block (6·5 cm.) and afford only slight evidence of\r\nbranching or anastomosing. A close examination of the steles shows that\r\nthey consist of portions of two series, an inner and outer set; there\r\nis also a curved vascular band in the central ground-tissue (fig. 437,\r\n_c_) and some isolated and scattered patches of vascular elements.\r\nEach stele of the inner series is made up of two parts, an outer\r\nsmaller and normally orientated group of secondary xylem and a larger\r\ninversely orientated inner group of identical structure. A single\r\nstele of the inner series is shown in fig. 438, B, C; the larger inner\r\nportion consists of slightly divergent rows of tracheids and uniseriate\r\nmedullary rays and is separated from the smaller portion by a narrow\r\nspace, _a_, occupied by crushed tissue which may correspond to the\r\n‘partial pith’ or primary xylem of a Medullosan stele. The two groups\r\nof xylem are no doubt the products of two cambium arcs, the protoxylem\r\nof each group being situated on the flat inner face. The cambium and\r\nphloem are represented only by crushed brown cells on the curved outer\r\nedge of the xylem. The separate individuality of the two portions of\r\neach stele is indicated not only by the presence of the ‘partial pith’\r\nbut by the discontinuity of the tissue at the ends of the narrow space.\r\nThe tracheids seen at _b_, fig. C, are in oblique longitudinal section\r\nand are probably being detached to form a leaf-trace. This type of\r\nstele may be compared with the steles of _Medullosa Solmsi_ (fig.\r\n416, L) but those of _Rhexoxylon_ differ in the lack of continuity of\r\nthe secondary xylem round the narrow band of crushed primary xylem.\r\nThe other steles of the inner ring exhibit the same dual nature though\r\nwith local modifications. In the stele seen in fig. 438, B, there is a\r\nclose approach to a continuous cylinder of secondary xylem especially\r\non the right-hand side. External to the inner series are several\r\nportions of normally orientated secondary xylem-groups (fig. 437):\r\nthese probably represent a second series of steles separated from the\r\ninner series by a narrow crushed arc of tissue on which the protoxylem\r\nstrands of the outer groups abut. The xylem of the outer steles agrees\r\nin its normal orientation with the outer and smaller part of the inner\r\nsteles and, as there is no accompanying group of inversely orientated\r\nxylem corresponding to the larger mass of secondary xylem of the inner\r\nseries, the outer strands are designated partial steles. The central\r\nstele consists of two curved irregular bands composed of vertically and\r\nobliquely running tracheids: the central part of this stele consists of\r\ncrushed tissue that probably represents primary xylem like that between\r\nthe two parts of each of the peripheral steles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438. _Rhexoxylon africanum_. A, radial wall of\r\ntracheid; B, C, peripheral steles; _a_, primary portion of stele; _b_,\r\nlateral strand. (After Bancroft.)]\r\n\r\n_Rhexoxylon_ differs from the usual Medullosan type in the structure\r\nof the secondary xylem which is composed of tracheids with an\r\nAraucarian form of pitting: there are usually two alternate rows of\r\ncontiguous pits (fig. 438, A) and occasionally one or three rows.\r\nThe medullary rays are uniseriate and 3 to 15 cells in depth, a\r\nfeature characteristic of coniferous wood and not of the wood of the\r\nMedulloseae.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of more complete information as to the anatomical\r\nstructure of this stem and of all information as to the leaves\r\nor reproductive organs it is impossible to fix with precision\r\nthe systematic position of the genus. It is, however, clear that\r\n_Rhexoxylon_ is closely connected with _Medullosa_ in certain\r\nfeatures though in the structure of the wood it exhibits important\r\npeculiarities. The imperfectly known stem _Cladoxylon Kidstoni_[408]\r\nshows a fairly close agreement with the African plant in the form of\r\nthe steles (fig. 460) but the pitting is scalariform.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUTCLIFFIA.= Scott.\r\n\r\n_Sutcliffia insignis_ Scott.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Sutcliffia_ was given by Dr Scott[409] to a peculiar\r\ntype of stem from the Lower Coal Measures of Shore, Lancashire, in\r\nrecognition of the valuable services rendered to Palaeobotany by the\r\nlate Mr W. H. Sutcliffe, the owner of the colliery from which several\r\nnew types of plants have been obtained. Two stems are recorded, the\r\ntype-specimen and a more recently discovered stem, also from Shore,\r\ndescribed by Miss de Fraine[410], which differs in several particulars\r\nfrom Dr Scott’s species. In view of the well-marked peculiarities of\r\nthe second stem it is convenient to speak of it as _forma β_ instead of\r\nincluding it without a distinctive epithet in _Sutcliffia insignis_. We\r\nknow nothing of the reproductive organs of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Sutcliffia insignis, forma α._\r\n\r\nThis consists of a piece of stem approximately 12 × 7 cm. in diameter\r\ncharacterised by a broad cortex of parenchyma with secretory sacs\r\nand ducts and strands of mechanical tissue (fig. 439, A). Decurrent\r\nand massive leaf-bases form a prominent feature as in the stem of\r\n_Medullosa anglica_. The stele, though compressed before petrifaction,\r\nwas probably not quite cylindrical but more or less polygonal or\r\nbroadly triangular in section; it consists of groups of large primary\r\ntracheids (350μ in diameter) with numerous bordered pits (fig. 439,\r\nB, and fig. 440) embedded in an anastomosing system of parenchyma\r\ncontaining scattered secretory sacs, a type of protostele like that\r\nof _Heterangium_ and _Medullosa_ _anglica_ except in the possession\r\nof exarch protoxylem strands. The metaxylem tracheids contiguous to\r\nthe external protoxylem elements have a dense spiral or scalariform\r\ntype of pitting. In the lower part of the stem the primary xylem is\r\nenclosed by a cambium which has added a few secondary tracheids (120μ\r\nin diameter), but in the upper part of the specimen the cambium is only\r\npartially developed and the addition of secondary xylem has hardly\r\nbegun (fig. 440). A narrow band of secondary phloem was recognised in\r\nplaces consisting of small-celled parenchyma with some sieve-tubes and\r\nmedullary rays continuous internally with the parenchyma of the primary\r\nstele. In close association and occasionally in organic connexion with\r\nthe surface of the stele are several tangentially elongated and large\r\ngroups of vascular tissue associated with smaller oval strands varying\r\nconsiderably in size. These groups, designated meristeles (Fig. 439,\r\nA), are identical in structure with the main stele and are occasionally\r\ninvested by a feebly developed zone of secondary xylem and phloem. The\r\nmeristeles are detached at intervals from the parent stele around which\r\nthey form by anastomoses an irregular network: the larger meristeles\r\ngive off smaller strands and from these the actual leaf-traces are\r\nproduced by subdivision. It appears, however, that in this type\r\nthe meristeles are not completely used up in the production of the\r\nleaf-traces, portions of them behaving as cauline vascular strands.\r\nA protoxylem of a meristele still attached to the central protostele\r\noccupies an internal position, and at a higher level, as separation\r\nof the meristele is effected, the spiral tracheids occur on the inner\r\nface. New meristeles are given off at intervals from the main stele\r\n‘to compensate for those parts of the reticulum which were used up in\r\nthe formation of leaf-trace strands[411].’ The meristeles form the\r\nstarting-point for the leaf-traces, an intermediate system between the\r\nmain stele and the actual leaf-traces; they differ, therefore, from the\r\nparent leaf-traces of _Medullosa anglica_, which are completely used up\r\nby repeated subdivision. Moreover in _Sutcliffia_ the leaf-bundles are\r\nconcentric and not collateral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439. _Sutcliffia insignia_ Scott. A, B, E, forma α.\r\n  (After Scott.) C, D, forma β.

These are interpreted by Scott as downward continuations\r\nin the stem of the inner surface of leaf-bases. The outer cortex of the\r\nstem and leaf-bases has hypodermal strands of stereome which remain\r\nseparate or rarely anastomose, and form a superficial zone exactly\r\nlike that of some species of _Medullosa_. The leaf-trace bundles may\r\nbe radially symmetrical or unilateral in the arrangement of the xylem\r\nwhich is in all cases completely surrounded by phloem. Fig. 439, B,\r\nshows part of a longitudinal section of a large leaf-trace bundle:\r\nspiral protoxylem elements (_px_) abut on the phloem (_ph_) and are\r\nsucceeded to the left by narrow scalariform and large reticulately\r\npitted tracheids. In the larger and radially constructed traces there\r\nare several protoxylem-strands distributed over the surface of the\r\nxylem, while in the smaller unilateral traces there may be one or\r\ntwo protoxylem strands. A characteristic feature of the xylem of the\r\nleaf-traces is the admixture of parenchyma with the tracheids (fig.\r\n439, B, E) and another noteworthy character is the occurrence of large\r\nthin-walled tubes in the phloem described by Scott as sieve-tubes and\r\ncompared with the large sieve-tubes in Marattiaceous leaf-bundles.\r\nImmediately internal to the hypoderm is a row of leaf-bundles (fig.\r\n439, A) each of which is accompanied by stereome strands.\r\n\r\nThe petioles, which reach a diameter of 12 cm., contain numerous,\r\noccasionally anastomosing, concentric bundles. Nothing is known of the\r\nfronds as a whole beyond the fact that they are spirally disposed and\r\nhad decurrent bases of large dimensions in proportion to the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sutcliffia insignis, forma β._\r\n\r\nThis form, described by Miss de Fraine as _Sutcliffia insignis_[412],\r\nis represented by a stem rather smaller than the type-specimen\r\ndescribed by Scott, though it is probably an older example of the same\r\nspecies. It is distinguished by a greater development of secondary\r\nxylem and phloem both on the main stele and the meristeles; it differs\r\nalso in the absence of the greater part of the cortex and leaf-bases\r\nwhich have been cut off as the result of the formation of a deep-seated\r\nperiderm (fig. 439, D, C). The meristeles are smaller and fewer than in\r\nthe larger form and are distinguished by some other peculiarities. At\r\n_m′_ in fig. 439, D, a meristele is seen attached to the main stele.\r\nIn _Sutcliffia insignis forma α_ the main stele is enclosed by an\r\nirregular network of subsidiary steles or meristeles and these form\r\nthe points of departure of the leaf-traces, but the meristeles are not\r\ncompletely used up in the process of conversion into leaf-traces. In\r\n_Sutcliffia insignis forma β_ the meristeles agree in structure with\r\nthe main stele except in the smaller amount of secondary tissue: they\r\ndo not, however, form a network as in _forma α_ but occur as strands\r\nparallel to the central stele, ‘giving off leaf-traces and ultimately\r\ndividing up into smaller strands, often unequal in size, the primary\r\nwood of the meristeles being entirely used up in the production of\r\nradially symmetrical or unilateral bundles.’ In this respect, as Miss\r\nde Fraine points out, _forma β_ agrees more closely than _forma α_ with\r\n_Medullosa anglica_ and supports Scott’s view that _Sutcliffia_ is a\r\nprimitive type of Medullosan stem. The leaves were given off at fairly\r\nlong intervals as in some species of _Medullosa_: the leaf-traces are\r\nexarch and similar to those of the type-species. The most striking\r\nfeature of the new stem is the presence of a vascular network (fig.\r\n439, D, _e_) which encloses both the main steles and the meristeles;\r\nit consists of extrafascicular strands composed of normally orientated\r\nbands of secondary xylem and phloem often assuming a fan-like\r\narrangement and occasionally almost concentric or inversely orientated.\r\nThese strands are always accompanied by short, usually reticulate,\r\ntracheids on the inner margin of the xylem: similar isodiametric\r\ntracheids also occur in the pericyclic region. The extrafascicular\r\nstrands are believed to be secondary structures phylogenetically\r\nindependent of the meristeles and main stele, comparable with the\r\nsuccessive cylinders or arcs of secondary xylem and phloem in some\r\nrecent Cycads and in some species of _Medullosa_[413].\r\n\r\nThe stele is exarch and roughly triangular; except in the broader\r\nzone of secondary tissue it agrees with the protostele of _forma α_.\r\nThe secondary xylem (fig. 439, C) possesses numerous medullary rays\r\n3–4 cells broad and of considerable depth: the secondary phloem is\r\ncharacterised by the presence of thick-walled elements, presumably\r\nsieve-tubes, like those of _Medullosa Leuckarti_ and _M. anglica_.\r\n\r\nThe ground-tissue is rich in secretory tissue and the stem-surface,\r\nfrom which the leaf-bases have been detached, is limited by a wide zone\r\nof secondary tissue produced by a phellogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sutcliffia Williamsoni_ (Seward).\r\n\r\n1876. _Myelopteris_ (_pars_) Williamson, Phil.

Vol. +vii.+\r\n      pt +iv.+ p. 62.\r\n\r\nIn an account of _Myelopteris_ (= _Myeloxylon_) published in 1876\r\nWilliamson included some sections of petioles from the Lower Coal\r\nMeasures which I afterwards with his concurrence transferred to the\r\ngenus _Rachiopteris_ as _R. Williamsoni_. In _Rachiopteris Williamsoni_\r\nthe vascular bundles are concentric and not collateral, and are\r\nfurther distinguished from those of _Myeloxylon_ by the association of\r\nparenchyma with the tracheids. In the arrangement of the bundles and\r\nin the structure of the ground-tissue the petioles of _Rachiopteris\r\nWilliamsoni_ agree with those of _Myeloxylon_. An outstanding feature\r\nof the vascular strands of the former is the occurrence at fairly\r\nregular intervals in the peripheral part of the phloem of comparatively\r\nlarge tubes described by me as secretory canals on the ground that\r\nevidence was furnished of their development by the schizogenous\r\nseparation of cells to form a central canal. The canals were compared\r\nwith the large sieve-tubes of the Marattiaceae, but with the\r\nqualification that ‘their mature form and their manner of development\r\nare strongly suggestive of small secretory canals.’ Nothing was known\r\nas to the stem which bore these petioles until Scott’s discovery of\r\n_Sutcliffia_ with vascular bundles in the cortex and leaf-bases of the\r\nsame type as those of _Rachiopteris Williamsoni_. As Scott says, there\r\nare a few distinguishing features which suggest that _R. Williamsoni_\r\nis not specifically identical with the petioles of _Sutcliffia\r\ninsignis_, though the agreement is such as to justify the substitution\r\nof _Sutcliffia_ for _Rachiopteris_. The tubular elements in the phloem\r\nwhich I considered to be secretory canals are regarded by Scott and\r\nMiss de Fraine as sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\nMiss de Fraine gives an excellent summary of our knowledge of the genus\r\nand discusses, in the light of the additional facts furnished by the\r\nsecond stem, the position of _Sutcliffia_ in a phylogenetic series.\r\nThe new form strengthens the comparison instituted by Scott between\r\n_Sutcliffia_ and _Medullosa_ and gives support to a close connexion\r\nbetween the Medulloseae and the Cycadaceae. Scott lays stress on the\r\nfact that the Medulloseae, except _Sutcliffia_, are polystelic, while\r\nthe Cycads, at least the adult stems, are monostelic. The views of\r\nWorsdell and other botanists who believe that the Medulloseae and\r\nthe Cycads are intimately related are discussed on another page: in\r\nreference to these views Miss de Fraine adds a caveat as to the danger\r\nof attaching excessive importance to evidence based on seedling anatomy\r\nwhen we are concerned with broad phylogenetic questions. The stele of\r\na cycadean stem may be derived from a protostelic type such as that of\r\n_Sutcliffia_ by the gradual disappearance of the internal tracheids:\r\nin _Sutcliffia_, as in some Cycads and species of _Medullosa_,\r\nextrafascicular strands and cylinders are a characteristic feature\r\nand these may well have arisen independently of the central stele\r\nin response to physiological requirements. From such a type as\r\n_Sutcliffia_ evolution may have proceeded along two lines; in one\r\ndirection new types were produced in which increasing complexity,\r\nas represented by a multiplication of steles, was an outstanding\r\nfeature. These forms, illustrated by _Medullosa anglica_ and other more\r\nelaborate species, proved inefficient and were unproductive. Along\r\nanother line the protostelic condition was maintained though in some\r\ncases extrafascicular strands or cylinders and cortical steles were\r\nsuperadded: it was this line that led to the recent Cycads.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _General considerations suggested by the anatomical features\r\n                            of_ Medullosa.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the stems described under the generic name _Medullosa_\r\nreveals a considerable range in the grosser anatomical features\r\nsuperadded to certain fundamental characters denoting a common\r\norigin[414]. If additional data were available giving us a fuller\r\nknowledge of individual plants differences between species would\r\nbe more clearly defined and would provide adequate grounds for the\r\ninstitution of new genera for some of the types now included in\r\nthe comprehensive genus _Medullosa_. A proposal by Dr Lotsy[415]\r\nto adopt the names _Pecopteromedullosa_ and _Neuropteromedullosa_\r\nrests primarily on the relatively unimportant difference between the\r\nfronds associated with certain Medullosan stems and, as Scott[416]\r\npoints out, this two-fold division if applied to such a species as\r\n_Medullosa Leuckarti_ would result in its separation from species\r\nwhich anatomically are clearly of the same generic type. In _Medullosa\r\nanglica_, one of the oldest and simplest types, there are three\r\nsteles of equal importance, and each of them is practically identical\r\nwith the single stele of _Heterangium_. Each stele—as indeed all\r\nMedullosan steles—consists of a strand of primary xylem enclosed by\r\nsecondary xylem and phloem, and it is obvious that the development\r\nof a constantly increasing cylinder of secondary conducting tissue\r\nabout three centres would lead to serious mechanical difficulty: a\r\nstem constructed on the plan of _Medullosa anglica_ or the smaller _M.\r\npusilla_ could not increase the thickness of its secondary vascular\r\ntissue beyond a certain point without detriment to its efficiency. In\r\nsome types this difficulty is partially overcome by the production of\r\ncomplete concentric cylinders of centrifugally developed conducting\r\ntissue external to an inner system of concentric steles agreeing\r\nindividually with those of _Heterangium_ (fig. 415, B). _Medullosa\r\nanglica_, regarded from the point of view of the architectural\r\nefficiency of its vascular system, affords a much less promising _point\r\nd’appui_ for further evolution than some of the forms described under\r\n_Medullosa stellata_ in which the mechanical impasse is avoided by the\r\nadoption of the cycadean plan as represented by such genera as _Cycas_\r\nand _Macrozamia_. The English species _Medullosa centrofilis_ (fig.\r\n417) affords the first example of a characteristic Medullosan feature,\r\nnamely the presence of a small concentric stele in the central region\r\nof the stem: this so-called star-ring differs not only in its smaller\r\ndimensions but in its more cylindrical form from the larger peripheral\r\nsteles. In the later Permian species, _e.g._ _Medullosa porosa_ and\r\n_M. Solmsi_, the single star-ring of the older _M. centrofilis_ is\r\nreplaced by a large number of precisely similar conducting strands.\r\nThese star-rings are structurally comparable with the cortical steles\r\nof _Cycas_ and, in position, with the medullary system of bundles in\r\na _Macrozamia_; they are essentially cauline and take no part in the\r\nemission of leaf-traces. _Medullosa Leuckarti_ (fig. 416, H) resembles\r\nin its vascular plan _M. centrofilis_, but in this larger stem there\r\nare several star-rings and the enlarged peripheral steles are more or\r\nless sinuous. In _Medullosa Solmsi_ (fig. 416, E) the star-rings are\r\nstill more numerous and the main vascular system consists of a double\r\nseries of concentric steles, each agreeing with the larger peripheral\r\nsteles of _M. Leuckarti_.\r\n\r\nSome of the forms included in _Medullosa stellata_ appear to be very\r\ndifferent from _M. anglica_ and _M. Leuckarti_ (_cf._ fig. 416, F, A,\r\nH), but their similarity is apparent if we imagine _Medullosa anglica_\r\nwith only one main stele (with the addition of star-rings) which is\r\nstretched tangentially until it becomes a long and narrow plate-ring\r\nand is then rolled into a hollow cylinder like that in fig. 416, D.\r\nA modification of the tubular type of stele is seen in _Medullosa\r\nstellata_ var. _corticata_ (fig. 416, G) in which the vascular\r\ncylinder is broken up into two or more curved plate-rings, a change\r\nsuperficially similar to that by which a dictyostele is produced from a\r\nsolenostele, but in _Medullosa_ it is not the overlapping of leaf-gaps\r\nthat is the cause of the change. A striking feature in the stem of\r\n_Medullosa stellata_ represented in fig. 416, D and F (especially\r\nF), is the inequality in breadth of the centrifugal and centripetal\r\nxylem: this inequality is an expression of the difficulty caused by the\r\npresence of an internal as well as an external addition of secondary\r\nconducting tissue. A limit is set to the production of secondary\r\ncentripetal xylem by the space available for extension, whereas there\r\nis unlimited room for increase in the case of the centrifugal tissue.\r\nThis tendency to a greater development of xylem and phloem on the\r\nouter side of the primary portion of the steles is illustrated also in\r\n_M. Solmsi_ var. _lignosa_ (fig. 416, L) where the outer of the two\r\nseries of peripheral steles has a much larger proportion of centrifugal\r\nxylem. In _M. anglica_ the secondary xylem on the inner side of the\r\nsteles is not infrequently broader than the corresponding tissue on\r\nthe abaxial side[417]; but this is exceptional in the genus. A further\r\ndevelopment of centrifugal conducting tissue without any corresponding\r\ndevelopment of centripetal tissue is effected in certain cases (fig.\r\n416, K, L) by the addition of concentric cylinders of centrifugal\r\nxylem and phloem beyond the original concentric steles. The type\r\nillustrated by _Medullosa Solmsi_ var. _lignosa_ and _M. stellata_ var.\r\n_gigantea_ (fig. 416, L, K) at once suggests comparison with stems of\r\n_Cycas_, _Macrozamia_, and _Encephalartos_, the chief difference being\r\nthe presence in _Medullosa_ of an inner series of concentric steles\r\nand a central ground-tissue containing star-rings, though the latter\r\nmay be regarded as corresponding to the medullary system of bundles\r\nin _Macrozamia_. In _Macrozamia_ the central region of the stem is\r\nconsidered to be the pith of a monostelic stem, whereas in _Medullosa_\r\nthe stem is polystelic. In recent cycadean stems it is not uncommon\r\nto find patches of inversely orientated xylem and phloem internal to\r\none or more of the cylinders of centrifugal vascular tissue. These\r\nabnormal developments are considered by Worsdell[418] to be relics of\r\nthe inner portions of concentric steles possessed by the Medullosan\r\nancestors of recent Cycads. This interpretation affords a means of\r\nbringing into closer relationship the polystelic Medulloseae and the\r\nmonostelic Cycadaceae, the apparent simplicity of the latter being\r\nthe result of the progressive loss of centripetal xylem and phloem,\r\nthe normal cycadean cylinder being therefore regarded as a one-sided\r\nremnant of a concentric Medullosan stele. In other words, the Cycads\r\nare descended from polystelic ancestors. As further evidence in support\r\nof this view Worsdell points to the occurrence of concentric steles\r\nin the cortex of _Cycas_ and their occasional presence in the pith\r\nof other genera. Matte[419] has shown that in the seedling stem of\r\n_Encephalartos Barteri_ (fig. 396, K) there are three concentric steles\r\neach similar to a normal Medullosan stele: at a higher level in the\r\naxis the steles become ‘unrolled’ and assume the form of one-sided\r\ncylinders of centrifugal xylem and phloem.\r\n\r\nIn the peduncles of some recent Cycads, _e.g._ _Stangeria_, there is\r\na tendency towards a somewhat irregular orientation of the collateral\r\nbundles that constitute the vascular cylinder, and tracheids\r\noccasionally occur internal to the protoxylem of the individual\r\nbundles[420]. Worsdell regards these features as evidence of a\r\nMedullosan ancestry. If the sinuous plate-rings of a stem of _Medullosa\r\nLeuckarti_ (fig. 416, H) were broken up into separate portions and\r\nwholly or in part deprived of the centripetal xylem, the result would\r\nbe an arrangement of bundles comparable with that in a _Stangeria_\r\npeduncle[421]. The scattered centripetal tracheids discovered by Scott\r\nin _Stangeria_ and other cycadean peduncles are interpreted by Scott\r\nand by Worsdell as relics of some ancestral centripetal xylem, but\r\nwith this important difference in the point of view; Scott believes\r\nthat they represent the almost completely aborted centripetal xylem\r\nof a single stele like that of _Lyginopteris_, while Worsdell sees\r\nin them fragmentary vestiges of the central primary xylem of two or\r\nmore Medullosan steles. An abnormal seedling of _Araucaria Bidwillii_\r\ndescribed by Shaw[422] exhibits features analogous to those in some\r\ncycadean seedlings: within the normal stele a cambium forms an\r\ninversely orientated vascular cylinder which at a lower level becomes\r\ncontinuous with the outer centrifugal tissue, the whole vascular system\r\nbeing eventually represented by two concentric steles. The polystelic\r\nstage is a development of a monostelic condition, and the inner or\r\ninverted portion of each of the two concentric steles is derived from\r\nan inversely orientated cylinder in the central region of the root.\r\nThis abnormal root does not, however, supply an argument in favour\r\nof the derivation of a monostelic type of stem from one that was\r\npolystelic, but it shows a close relation between the two plans in\r\none organ. The seedling is not altogether normal in form apart from\r\nstructure and it is not improbable that the anatomical abnormality is\r\nconnected with some pathological cause.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested[423] that Worsdell attaches too much phylogenetic\r\nsignificance to the irregularities in the disposition and form of the\r\nvascular bundles in the peduncle of _Stangeria_, and the criticism that\r\ninsufficient allowance is made for the possible reaction on structure\r\nof the special physiological requirements of reproductive shoots is\r\nwell founded. Granting an overestimate of the arguments drawn from the\r\noccasional occurrence of concentric vascular strands, a considerable\r\nbody of evidence remains in favour of Worsdell’s main contention.\r\n\r\nMrs Thoday[424] has drawn attention to certain features exhibited by\r\nthe inflorescence-axes of _Welwitschia_, particularly the occurrence\r\nof concentric and inversely orientated bundles, similar to those\r\ncharacteristic of the seedling of _Cycas siamensis_[425] described\r\nby Matte, and to anatomical characters occasionally present in adult\r\ncycadean stems and normally represented in _Medullosa_. She is of\r\nopinion that the occurrence in _Welwitschia_ of certain Medullosan\r\nfeatures has a phylogenetic significance. The differences between the\r\nGnetales, Medulloseae, and Cycadales are considerable, and it would\r\nseem unlikely that the anatomical resemblances described by Mrs Thoday\r\nare of great value as criteria of close relationship. The comparison\r\nof _Lagenostoma_ with gnetalean seeds is alluded to elsewhere. To the\r\nstatement that the presence of concentric and inversely orientated\r\nsteles in _Welwitschia_ are reminiscent of the polystelic Medulloseae,\r\nMrs Thoday adds the qualifying remark that the occurrence of four\r\nconcentric groups of vascular tissue in the hypocotyl of _Welwitschia_\r\nis not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the ancestral type was\r\npolystelic. This reservation accords with the contention of Scott and\r\nother botanists, that the occasional occurrence in cycadean seedlings\r\nand adult stems of anatomical features suggestive of polystely does\r\nnot in itself furnish an adequate reason for doubting that the\r\napparent monostely of Cycads is phylogenetically what it seems to\r\nbe, namely, an indication of monostelic ancestry. This brings us to\r\nthe question of a possible monostelic ancestor. It may be that the\r\nUpper Carboniferous genus _Sutcliffia_ affords a clue to the problem\r\nof the origin of the polystelic type illustrated in various forms by\r\n_Medullosa_. The protostele of _Sutcliffia_ bears a close resemblance\r\nto each of the three steles of _Medullosa anglica_; the fact that\r\n_Sutcliffia_ is exarch and that _Medullosa anglica_ has mesarch xylem\r\nis of secondary importance, particularly as exarchy is represented\r\nwithin the genus _Medullosa_. The extrafascicular strands of xylem\r\nand phloem and the accessory strands are points in which _Sutcliffia_\r\nand _Medullosa anglica_ agree and, as Miss de Fraine[426] adds, the\r\nmeristeles of _Sutcliffia_ may be homologous with the leaf-trace\r\nstrands of _Medullosa_. Scott[427] gave expression to the characters\r\nshared by these two types by describing _Sutcliffia_ as the most\r\nprimitive of the Medulloseae. It is suggested that the protostelic\r\naxis of _Sutcliffia_ may be regarded as the starting-point of the\r\nmonostelic Cycads, the central mass of tracheal tissue being replaced\r\nby a parenchymatous pith, while the extrafascicular and accessory\r\nstrands arose independently of the central stele in response to\r\nincreased physiological demands consequent on the increase in size of\r\nthe stem. From the same starting-point evolution may have progressed\r\nalong another line through such a type as _Medullosa anglica_ leading\r\nto the more complex Permian species of _Medullosa_. Chodat’s view[428]\r\nthat the Medulloseae are Protocycadaceae, if we include _Sutcliffia_\r\nas well as _Medullosa_ in the Medulloseae, is probably correct. There\r\nis clear evidence of a close bond of union between recent Cycads and\r\nthe Medulloseae, and _Sutcliffia_ offers a possible means of deriving\r\ncomplex polystelic types from a monostelic ancestor.\r\n\r\nWorsdell’s opinion[429] that the stele of _Lyginopteris_ affords\r\nevidence of derivation from a polystelic ancestor and is not\r\nhomologous with the true monostele of _Heterangium_ is opposed to\r\nthe undoubted signs of intimate connexion exhibited by these genera.\r\nThe Lyginopterideae are, as Scott[430] says, a less advanced group\r\nthan the Medulloseae and, it may be added, they are more remote from\r\nthe modern representatives of the Cycadales. The Lyginopterideae and\r\nthe Medulloseae are probably offshoots of a common stock, but the\r\nMedulloseae occupy a position farther removed from the filicinean\r\nancestry than _Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_[431].\r\n\r\nThe relative meagreness of our knowledge of the reproductive organs of\r\nthe Medulloseae gives precedence to anatomical data in phylogenetic\r\nconsiderations, but the evidence furnished by _Trigonocarpus_ and other\r\nseeds that may fairly be assigned to Medullosan plants is in harmony\r\nwith the conclusions based on vegetative characters with regard to a\r\nclose affinity between the Medulloseae and Cycads.\r\n\r\nThe comparative examination of recent Cycads naturally suggested by any\r\nattempt to compare the group as a whole with Palaeozoic types leads to\r\nsome apparently contradictory results. The habit of the megasporophyll\r\nof _Cycas_ is usually quoted as a primitive attribute: the close\r\nresemblance in plan and in manner of occurrence on the stem between\r\nmegasporophylls and foliage leaves recalls both Ferns and Medullosan\r\nfronds. On the other hand the production of eight body-cells in the\r\npollen-tube of _Microcycas_[432] in place of the usual single cell may\r\nalso be regarded as a primitive character. It is perhaps possible, as\r\nMiss Dorety[433] says, that the polyspermy may be a case of recurrence\r\nand not a direct inheritance. _Microcycas_ differs from _Cycas_ in\r\nhaving only one vascular cylinder, and if the presence of several\r\nconcentric cylinders in _Cycas_ be interpreted as an indication of\r\na closer connexion with a Medullosan ancestry, the _Microcycas_ type\r\nwould represent a more advanced stage in evolution. Attempts to arrange\r\nplants according to a natural sequence are frequently frustrated by\r\ninstances of unequal progress in the development of vegetative and\r\nreproductive organs; one or other set of members lags behind; some\r\ncharacters point to the retention of primitive traits while others\r\nindicate a marked progressive tendency. It is noteworthy that the\r\nMesozoic Bennettitales are characterised by a greater simplicity of\r\nstem-structure than is the rule in recent Cycads, and both in their\r\nvegetative features and in the structure of the seeds they are further\r\nremoved from the Medullosan type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441. _Steloxylon Ludwigii._ A, surface-view\r\n(longitudinal) of stem showing leaf-bases.

A. =STELOXYLEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Steloxylon.= Solms-Laubach.\r\n\r\n_Steloxylon Ludwigii_ (Goeppert and Stenzel). The genus is founded\r\non a piece of stem from Siberia, possibly of Permian age though\r\nnot improbably older, which was originally described as _Medullosa\r\nLudwigii_[434]. It is characterised by numerous cylindrical and\r\nband-like vascular strands forming an irregular anastomosing system\r\n(fig. 441, B) and by crowded spiral leaf-scars on the exposed face.\r\nThe appearance presented by the transverse section figured by these\r\nauthors, while suggesting comparison with _Medullosa_, reveals a\r\ndistinctive character, namely the absence of a definite peripheral\r\nsystem of vascular rings such as forms a striking feature of the\r\ncontinental Medulloseae. A more complete description was afterwards\r\npublished by Schenk[435] who recognised more fully the peculiar\r\nfeatures and hinted at the possibility that the species might\r\nmore appropriately be regarded as a member of a distinct group.\r\nSolms-Laubach[436] went a step further and instituted the generic name\r\n_Steloxylon_, and in a later publication gave a fuller account of the\r\nanatomical characters. The complete stem must have reached a diameter\r\nof approximately 13 cm. The homogeneous ground-tissue forms a matrix\r\nenclosing an anastomosing vascular system of cylindrical or oval steles\r\n(fig. 441, C). Each strand consists of a band of secondary xylem\r\ntracheids with one or several rows of circular or oval bordered pits\r\non the radial walls and narrow medullary rays usually 1–2 cells broad\r\nand 1–4 cells deep, though occasionally deeper. No phloem is preserved.\r\nThe tissue in the centre of each stele is very imperfectly preserved,\r\nbut it is clear that the secondary xylem enclosed a central region\r\n(‘partial pith’) like that in the steles of a _Medullosa_, doubtless\r\nconsisting of primary xylem and conjunctive parenchyma.\r\n\r\nThe stem is covered with leaf-bases of oval or circular section and\r\nbetween them are small organs, probably multicellular hairs (fig. 441,\r\nA). A leaf-base consists of an outer zone of strengthening tissue\r\nand a parenchymatous ground-tissue traversed by two or more small\r\nvascular strands which assume various forms. These petiolar strands\r\nare simply portions of the main vascular system which bend outwards\r\nat the periphery of the anastomosing network. The more noteworthy\r\nfeatures in which _Steloxylon_ differs from _Medullosa_, particularly\r\nsuch species as _M. stellata_ and _M. Leuckarti_, are (i) the crowded\r\nand comparatively small leaf-bases in place of the massive decurrent\r\npetioles of _Medullosa_; (ii) the supply of the leaves by compact\r\nbranches of the stelar network instead of the bundles detached\r\nas leaf-traces from a stem-stele of _Medullosa_ (the origin of a\r\nleaf-trace in _Steloxylon_ is shown in fig. 441, C); (iii) the absence\r\nof a peripheral system of vascular plate-rings and the irregular\r\ndistribution of cylindrical and plate-steles in the ground-tissue.\r\nNothing is known of the reproductive organs or leaves beyond the\r\nstructure of the attached leaf-bases. The opinion expressed by P.\r\nBertrand[437] that the fossil described by Stenzel as _Asterochlaena_\r\n(_Clepsydropsis_) _kirgisica_ is the petiole of _Steloxylon_ was\r\nabandoned after the additional facts published by Solms-Laubach.\r\n\r\nAs regards the affinities of _Steloxylon_: the structure of the steles\r\nagrees closely with that of the star- and plate-rings of a _Medullosa_,\r\nwhile the pitting of the tracheids is more like that in _Medullosa_\r\nthan _Cladoxylon_. In the tendency to a more radial than tangential\r\ndisposition of the band-like steles _Steloxylon_ recalls _Cladoxylon_\r\nrather than _Medullosa_, but in _Cladoxylon_ the vascular system does\r\nnot form an irregular network as in _Steloxylon_. The information as\r\nto the structure of the primary xylem is very meagre, but it points\r\nto a closer connexion with _Medullosa_ than with _Cladoxylon_. On the\r\nwhole _Steloxylon_ may perhaps be defined as a genus allied to the\r\nMedulloseae in the anatomical features of the stem more closely than\r\nto other genera, but sufficiently distinct to be excluded from the\r\nMedulloseae as at present understood[438].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n  PTERIDOSPERMS REPRESENTED BY SEED-BEARING LEAVES ONLY OR LEAVES IN\r\n      CONSTANT ASSOCIATION WITH SEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore describing other genera represented by petrified vegetative\r\norgans exhibiting in their anatomical features points of contact with\r\nthe Medulloseae, a short account is intercalated of some imperfectly\r\nknown seed-bearing fronds and seeds belonging to the Pteridosperms but\r\nwhich do not afford sufficient data to admit of their reference to a\r\nmore precise position in a natural classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pecopteris Pluckeneti_ (Schlotheim).\r\n\r\nIn the section in Volume +ii.+ devoted to the genus _Pecopteris_\r\nreference was made to the species _P. Pluckeneti_[439], further\r\ntreatment being deferred until other Pteridosperms had been described.\r\nThe fern-like fronds originally described by Schlotheim as _Filicites\r\nPluckeneti_[440] and afterwards transferred by Brongniart and other\r\nauthors to _Pecopteris_[441] are now recognised as the leaves of a\r\nPteridosperm. Some doubt has been expressed as to the specific identity\r\nof the specimens figured by Schlotheim and Brongniart respectively,\r\nbut Potonié’s examination of the type-specimen of the earlier author\r\nconvinced him that Brongniart’s leaves were correctly named. The\r\nlarge fronds of _Pecopteris Pluckeneti_ are characterised by the\r\nbifurcation of the principal axis which bears opposite pairs of bi-\r\nor tri-pinnate branches and in the angles of the bifurcations of the\r\nrachis undeveloped buds occur on prolongations of the axis, a habit\r\nrecalling recent species of _Gleichenia_[442] (figs. 225 and 226, vol.\r\n+ii.+). The variation in the form of the pinnules is shown in fig.\r\n442, A, which represents both the apical portion and parts of pinnae\r\n10 cm. lower on the rachis of a large leaf from the Coal Measures of\r\nRadstock. The species is characteristic of the Upper Coal Measures and\r\nis recorded also from Permian strata. In 1883 Sterzel adopted for this\r\nspecies the generic name _Dicksonites_ because of the occurrence of\r\nshallow circular cups at the end of the lowest lateral vein on some of\r\nthe pinnules which he believed to be sori of the Cyatheaceous type.\r\nThe cups have an involute margin and occasionally a small scar in the\r\ncentre (fig. 442, B). Stur[443] declined to accept Sterzel’s evidence\r\nas satisfactory and suggested a fungal origin for the sorus-like\r\nimpressions, a view, as Sterzel objected, that is rendered improbable\r\nby the constant position of the single cups on several pinnules. The\r\nnature of Sterzel’s ‘sori’ has not been demonstrated: it is suggested\r\nby Grand’Eury[444] that they mark the position of microsporangia.\r\nSome seed-bearing specimens in Dr Kidston’s collection show cups,\r\nlike those figured by Sterzel, on pinnules from which the seeds have\r\nfallen, and it is not improbable that they are the scars of seeds. In\r\n1905 Grand’Eury published a description and photographs of specimens\r\nof _P. Pluckeneti_ from the St Étienne coal-field showing hundreds of\r\nwell-preserved seeds, many of them attached to pinnules characterised\r\nby a very slightly reduced lamina. Some fronds were found to be\r\nentirely fertile, while others bore both sterile and fertile pinnae.\r\nThe smallest seeds, 5 mm. long and 3 mm. broad, were found at the tips\r\nof unexpanded leaves: the mature seeds, only slightly larger, agree in\r\ntheir broadly oval form and narrow marginal ‘wing’ with small examples\r\nof _Samaropsis_[445]. The seeds were figured by Grand’Eury[446] in\r\nan earlier work as _Carpolithes granulatus_. They are believed to\r\nhave hung free from the lamina, a conclusion based on the position\r\nof the seeds relative to the plane of the pinnule in well-preserved\r\nexamples. Prof. Zeiller informs me that he is by no means certain\r\nthat Grand’Eury’s seed-bearing fronds should not be referred to\r\n_Pecopteris Sterzeli_; but as that species and _P. Pluckeneti_ are\r\nvery closely allied forms and may well have borne the same general\r\ntype of fructification, the question of specific difference does not\r\naffect the significance of Grand’Eury’s discovery. A statement was made\r\nin vol. +ii.+[447], quoted from Grand’Eury, that the fronds of _P.\r\nSterzeli_ were borne on a _Psaronius_ stem, but Prof. Zeiller told me\r\nthat in his opinion the fronds and stem are merely in association and\r\nnot in organic contact. It is probable that the _Psaronius_ stem bore\r\nfronds of some species of _Pecopteris_ with sori of the _Asterotheca_\r\nor _Scolecopteris_ type and not seeds. _Pecopteris Pluckeneti_ and _P.\r\nSterzeli_ are no doubt the fronds of a Pteridosperm[448], but apart\r\nfrom the seed-impressions there is no evidence as to the nature of\r\nthe reproductive organs or stem. The form of the seeds with a fairly\r\nthick sarcotesta, which gives them a winged appearance, suggests a\r\nmember of the Medulloseae rather than a plant with seeds like those of\r\n_Lyginopteris_ and _Heterangium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 442. _Pecopteris Pluckeneti._ A, apex and lower\r\npinnae (Kidston Coll., 234); B, pinnule with supposed sorus (after\r\nSterzel); C, pinnule with seeds (after Zeiller).]\r\n\r\n_Eremopteris artemisaefolia_ Steinberg with _Samaropsis acuta_ Lindley\r\nand Hutton.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Eremopteris_ was instituted by Schimper for a type\r\nof frond from the Coal Measures of Newcastle described by Sternberg as\r\n_Sphenopteris artemisaefolia_. He included also a second species, _E.\r\nNeesii_, from the Permian of Bohemia: this was removed by Zeiller to\r\n_Callipteris_. The type-species of _Eremopteris_ is included in this\r\nchapter on the ground that the almost constant association with the\r\nfronds of seeds comparable with those described by White as _Aneimites_\r\n(_Wardia_) _fertilis_ affords a strong argument in favour of assigning\r\n_Eremopteris artemisaefolia_ to the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n1826. _Sphenopteris artemisaefolia_ Steinberg, Flor.

Vol. +l.+ Pt\r\n      +i.+ p. 156.\r\n\r\nThe large compound fronds of this species[449] are characterised by\r\nthe regular dichotomy of the main branches, a feature frequently met\r\nwith in Palaeozoic fern-like leaves: the cuneate or oval-cuneiform\r\npinnules (fig. 443, A, C) vary considerably in breadth from the typical\r\ncuneate type of segment as figured by Brongniart[450] to narrow,\r\nalmost linear, leaflets like those of _Sphenopteris crithmifolia_.\r\nSeveral spreading veins traverse the lamina. Lindley and Hutton, while\r\nadmitting a very close resemblance between their species and _S.\r\nartemisaefolia_, adopted a distinctive name. The only evidence so far\r\nobtained as to the stem of the plant is furnished by some specimens\r\nin the Hutton collection (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) one of which shows a\r\npiece of rhizome bearing several petioles (fig. 443, B): there are no\r\npinnules attached to the rachises but some occur in close association.\r\nBrongniart noticed the frequent association of _Eremopteris_ fronds\r\nwith small seeds, but he regarded it as accidental. Dr Kidston[451]\r\nhas recently drawn attention to a note by Prof. Duns published in\r\n1872 on the juxtaposition of seeds and fronds, and Mr Howse[452] in\r\nhis Catalogue of the Hutton plants considers that the seeds were borne\r\non the _Eremopteris_ leaves; in his synonymy of _E. artemisaefolia_\r\nhe includes _Cardiocarpon acutum_ Lind. and Hutt. as the ‘spore-cases\r\nor sporangia.’ The _Eremopteris_ seeds are of the platyspermic\r\n(_Samaropsis_) type, broadly oval and about 7 mm. long with an obtuse\r\nbase and two slightly divergent acute processes at the apex (fig. 444).\r\nSome specimens in Dr Kidston’s collection from the Lower Coal Measures\r\nof Midlothian, which were associated with _Eremopteris_ fronds, are\r\npreserved as mummified cuticular membranes and on microscopical\r\nexamination they show clearly the presence of a pollen-chamber.\r\nThe seeds are of the _Samaropsis_ type. The drawings reproduced in\r\nfig. 444 were made for me by Dr Kidston from two specimens, in his\r\ncollection, of exceptionally well-preserved seeds from Midlothian:\r\nthe seeds of this species vary considerably in size and form; some are\r\nalmost orbicular and show no distinction between nucule and border\r\n(fig. 444, A) while in others (B) the impression of the flattened\r\nand longitudinally striated sarcotesta is clearly distinguished.\r\nKidston is of opinion that in younger seeds there is a single apical\r\npoint replaced in a later stage of development by two cusps, as seen\r\nin figs. A and B, formed by the opening of the micropylar tube. A\r\nridge in the middle of the flattened surface indicates the position\r\nof the vascular bundles in the principal plane as in _Cardiocarpus_.\r\nThe fully developed seeds are 8–9 mm. long. The correlation of the\r\nseeds represented in figs. 443 and 444 with _Eremopteris_ fronds\r\nfurnishes an additional illustration of the impossibility of trusting\r\nto external form as a criterion of affinity, for it is known that\r\nseeds of the _Samaropsis_ type were produced by Pteridosperms with\r\nfoliage represented by _Eremopteris artemisaefolia_ and _Pecopteris\r\nPluckeneti_, also by some members of the Cordaitales (_e.g._ fig. 480).\r\nDr Arber[453] has recently proposed a new generic name _Cornucarpus_\r\nfor _Cardiocarpon acutum_, but the drawings that he gives of seeds from\r\nthe Kent coal-field referred to this species suggest a type distinct\r\nfrom that of Lindley and Hutton. In the absence of specimens showing\r\nactual attachment it is impossible to say how the seeds were borne,\r\nbut the analogy of _Wardia fertilis_ and _Pecopteris Pluckeneti_ lends\r\nsupport to the view that the seeds were attached to pinnules with a\r\nreduced lamina. _Eremopteris artemisaefolia_ occurs in the Lower and\r\nMiddle Coal Measures of England: a species recorded by Kidston from\r\nthe Calciferous sandstone of Scotland as _E. Macconochii_[454] is now\r\nbelieved by that author to be generically distinct[455]. With the\r\nexception of the unsatisfactory specimen reproduced in fig. 443, B, we\r\nhave no information with regard to the habit of the stem to which the\r\n_Eremopteris_ leaves were attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443. _Eremopteris artemisaefolia._ A, part\r\nof a frond with associated seeds of _Samaropsis acuta_; B, rhizome\r\nwith fragments of fronds; C, pinnule.

Another example of a fern-like frond bearing\r\nseeds is afforded by specimens from the Lower Pottsville series of\r\nVirginia (correlated with the Millstone grit of British geologists)\r\ndescribed by Mr David White[456] as _Aneimites_ (_Wardia_) _fertilis_.\r\nThe compound fronds usually referred to the genus _Adiantides_ or\r\n_Adiantites_[457] are characterised by cuneate pinnules with a thin\r\nlamina and forked, slightly divergent veins (fig. 445, A, D). White\r\ndiscards the name _Adiantides_ in favour of Dawson’s genus _Aneimites_\r\non the ground that Goeppert[458], who instituted the former term,\r\napplied it in the first instance to leaves of _Ginkgo_ which he\r\nidentified as simple Fern fronds. In spite of this misapplication of\r\nthe name it has been constantly used and is well established. The\r\ndiscovery of seeds is, however, a reason for the adoption of a new\r\ngeneric name, and as White proposed _Wardia_ for the seeds it may\r\nappropriately be extended to the fronds in place of the provisional\r\nterm _Aneimites_. The seeds which occur at the apices of slender\r\npedicels on pinnae bearing relatively small pinnules with a reduced\r\nlamina (fig. 445, B, C) are rhomboidal in shape, 4·5 mm. long and 2·5\r\nmm. broad. The bilaterally symmetrical seeds were probably enclosed,\r\nas White suggests, in a fleshy integument which on pressure became\r\nlaterally extended as a wing-like border. In some of the seeds there\r\nis an indication of a ‘slight collapse within the apex of the nutlet,’\r\nwhich may mean the presence of a pollen-chamber; but while the\r\npreservation is too imperfect to afford any decisive evidence as to\r\nanatomical features, there is no reason to doubt the conclusion as to\r\nthe seed-nature of the organs described by White. Nothing is known of\r\nthe stem, though the opinion may be hazarded that _Wardia_ is a member\r\nof the Medulloseae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adiantites bellidulus_ Heer and _Lagenospermum Arberi_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nReference is made to the genus _Lagenospermum_ in the account of\r\n_Lagenostoma_[459]. The species _Lagenospermum Arberi_ has recently\r\nbeen founded by Dr Nathorst[460] on some seeds obtained from Lower\r\nCarboniferous rocks in Spitzbergen: a brief description is intercalated\r\nhere because it is probable that they were borne on fronds of the\r\n_Adiantites_ type similar to those on which White found the seeds\r\ndescribed by him as _Wardia_. The seeds of _L. Arberi_, 14–18 ×\r\n5 mm., are spindle-shaped with an obtuse apex and longitudinally\r\nribbed with a stalk at least 7 mm. long. Nathorst considers that\r\na cupule was probably present: the specimens do not convey the\r\nimpression of naked seeds and in some examples there are indications\r\nof an investing envelope, though this may be the result of tearing\r\nof the testa. Nathorst regards the Spitzbergen seeds as probably\r\nspecifically identical with a specimen described by Schmalhausen[461]\r\nfrom Carboniferous rocks in the Urals as _Rhabdocarpus orientalis_\r\nEich., a species which agrees closely with _Lagenospermum nitidulum_\r\nas described by Heer[462] (under the name _Carpolithes nitidulus_) and\r\nNathorst[463] from Spitzbergen. It is also possible that Kidston’s\r\n_Rhabdocarpus elongatus_[464], from the Lanarkshire coal-field and\r\nelsewhere, recently transferred by Arber[465] to _Platyspermum_, is\r\nan example of the same species. The chief interest of _Lagenospermum_\r\nlies in the fact, assuming Nathorst’s correlation of the seeds with\r\n_Adiantites bellidulus_ Heer to be correct, that it is a typical\r\nradiospermic seed, while _Wardia_, borne on foliage of the same general\r\ntype, is an equally typical platyspermic seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                            CYCADOFILICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter are included several types represented by stems,\r\nbut which in the absence of definite information with regard to the\r\nreproductive organs cannot be assigned to the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MEGALOXYLEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Megaloxylon.= Seward.\r\n\r\nThis genus is represented by a single species founded on a piece of\r\nstem from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire discovered in the\r\nBinney Collection in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge[466]. Nothing\r\nis known as to the leaves, reproductive organs, or roots. The\r\ntype-specimen consists exclusively of primary and secondary xylem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Megaloxylon Scotti_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen, reproduced natural size in fig. 446, A, B, consists\r\nof a fragment of stem which at first sight bears a close resemblance\r\nto _Cordaites_, but the apparent pith, 1·9 cm. in diameter, is the\r\nprimary xylem of the stele and is enclosed by an incomplete cylinder\r\nof secondary xylem 2 cm. broad. The distinction between the lighter\r\nprimary xylem and the darker secondary cylinder is especially well\r\nmarked in the longitudinal section (fig. 446, B). The central region,\r\nshown on a larger scale in fig. 447, is occupied by groups of tracheids\r\nvarying in size and shape associated with thin-walled parenchyma: the\r\nlatter is represented by lighter patches in the section. The majority\r\nof the tracheids are characterised by their great breadth—in some\r\ncases ·4 mm.—and their isodiametric or even horizontally elongated\r\nand flattened form. Some of these large metaxylem elements are seen in\r\nlongitudinal section at _m_ in fig. 448 where the shrinkage and partial\r\ndecay of the parenchymatous tissue have resulted in the separation of\r\ntransverse bands of xylem simulating the discoid pith of a _Cordaites_.\r\nThe walls of these tracheal cells are covered with multiseriate pits.\r\nWith the short and sometimes flattened xylem elements occur others of\r\ngreater length, but these are chiefly met with in the more peripheral\r\npart of the central region where some of the tracheids are much\r\nnarrower and have the form of ordinary water-conducting elements. On\r\none side of the primary xylem in fig. 447 an oval and more compact\r\ngroup of narrow and longer tracheids is seen at _lt¹_; this is a\r\nleaf-trace about to enter the secondary-xylem cylinder on its outward\r\ncourse. The same leaf-trace is shown at _lt_ in fig. 446, B; as it\r\ndescends the trace becomes less distinct and its elongated elements\r\ngradually merge into the general mass of metaxylem. A portion of this\r\nleaf-trace is seen in fig. 448, B, _lt_, close to the inner edge of\r\nthe secondary xylem, _x²_, and abutting internally on the contracted\r\ntissue, _m_, which consists mainly of large and short tracheae with\r\nremains of associated parenchyma. The trace includes some conjunctive\r\nparenchyma interspersed with the tracheids: on its outer surface, that\r\nis on the abaxial edge of the ovate xylem strand as shown at _lt¹_ in\r\nfig. 447, there are six external protoxylem strands. In the peripheral\r\nregion of the primary xylem of the section reproduced in fig. 447\r\nthere are several more or less well-defined leaf-traces, _e.g._ _lt²_,\r\n_lt³_; these differ from that seen at _lt¹_ in their greater tangential\r\nbreadth and in the less compact arrangement of the tracheids. As each\r\ntrace is followed downwards in the primary region of the stele it tends\r\nto become broader, especially in a tangential direction; the spiral\r\nprotoxylem strands are more widely separated (fig. 448, A, _px_) and\r\nthe elongated and comparatively narrow tracheids as they spread out\r\nfan-wise are reduced in length, finally passing over into the broad\r\nand short reticulately pitted cells. Each leaf-trace can be followed\r\nthrough approximately four internodes before its individuality is lost\r\nin the general mass of metaxylem. The disposition of the peripheral\r\ntraces is such as to justify the conclusion that the phyllotaxis of the\r\nstem is ⅖.[467]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446. _Megaloxylon Scotti._ A, B.

The medullary\r\nrays are numerous and vary in breadth from 1 to 5 cells, while the\r\ntracheids, with multiseriate bordered pits on their radial walls, form\r\nbands 1 to 8 elements in breadth. There are no regular rings of growth\r\nbut occasional arcs of narrow tracheids interfere slightly with the\r\notherwise uniform structure of the wood. A leaf-trace in its oblique\r\noutward course through the wood becomes completely enclosed by a\r\ncylinder of secondary xylem and thus appears to be concentric. Owing\r\nto the absence of any tissue external to the secondary xylem of the\r\nstem, statements as to the subsequent behaviour of the leaf-traces on\r\nemerging from the stele are purely hypothetical. It is, however, not\r\nimprobable that each concentric trace lost its secondary tissue and\r\nbroke up into several collateral strands, a suggestion based on the\r\nbehaviour of the leaf-traces in _Medullosa anglica_.\r\n\r\nThe most striking characteristics of _Megaloxylon_ are: (i) the\r\nstructure of the primary xylem, particularly the unusual form of the\r\nmajority of the metaxylem tracheids, a form obviously correlated\r\nwith storage rather than with conduction of water; (ii) the gradual\r\nspreading of the leaf-traces and their absorption as they descend into\r\nthe main mass of the xylem; (iii) the exarch structure of the primary\r\nxylem. Confining our attention to the primary region of the stele; a\r\ncomparison is at once suggested with _Heterangium_. In _Megaloxylon_\r\nthe peculiarities are the substitution of the large storage-tracheids\r\nfor the normal xylem-elements; the greater irregularity in the groups\r\nof metaxylem; and an exarch instead of a mesarch structure. In these\r\nlast features the primary xylem agrees with that of recent species of\r\nthe Schizaeaceous Fern _Lygodium_ and the external protoxylem is a\r\ncharacter shared with _Rhetinangium_. The occurrence of short tracheids\r\nsimilar to those of _Megaloxylon_ in the inner portion of the stele of\r\nthe Osmundaceous Fern _Zalesskya gracilis_ (Eich.)[468] may be quoted\r\nas an example of parallel modification but, as Scott[469] points out,\r\nthe resemblance has no phylogenetic significance. The secondary xylem\r\nthough less parenchymatous than in recent Cycads agrees more closely\r\nwith the manoxylic than with the pycnoxylic type.\r\n\r\n_Megaloxylon_ affords an interesting example of a combination of\r\nprimary stelar anatomical features, comparable in the exarch position\r\nof the protoxylem with the stele of _Lygodium_, and secondary wood\r\nsimilar to that of _Lyginopteris_ and _Heterangium_. The large\r\nmetaxylem tracheids may be regarded as derivatives of elements which\r\nin some ancestral type were structurally fitted for the rôle of\r\nwater-transport and made up the xylem of a _Lygodium_-like stele with\r\nlittle or no secondary xylem. As the cambial activity increased and\r\ncentrifugal xylem became a prominent feature, usurping the function of\r\nthe centripetal xylem, the latter became modified and fitted for a new\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=RHETINANGIEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Rhetinangium.= Gordon.\r\n\r\n_Rhetinangium Arberi_ Gordon.\r\n\r\nThe stem on which this genus is founded was discovered by Dr\r\nGordon[470] in the Calciferous Sandstone series of Pettycur: a\r\nspecimen collected by Dr Kidston in Berwickshire may be specifically\r\nidentical with the Pettycur plant. We know nothing of the leaves or\r\nreproductive organs of _Rhetinangium_. The stem, approximately 2 cm.\r\nin diameter, was probably cylindrical; it possesses a single stele\r\nconsisting mainly of a central primary region occupied by anastomosing\r\ngroups of tracheids, 130–150μ in diameter, embedded in parenchyma\r\ncontaining numerous secretory sacs and ducts. In the peripheral region\r\nof the stele the groups of tracheids consist of narrower elements\r\ncharacterised by exarch protoxylem. Each peripheral group forms the\r\nbase of a wedge of secondary xylem (fig. 450, _x²_), the primary\r\nmedullary rays being in direct connexion with some of the parenchyma of\r\nthe primary xylem. The secondary tracheids, 45–85μ in diameter, have\r\nmultiseriate bordered pits on their radial walls and the rays are broad\r\nand deep as in _Heterangium_ and _Lyginopteris_. With the exception of\r\nthe external position of the protoxylem, the stele of _Rhetinangium_\r\nis practically identical with that of _Heterangium_, though in\r\n_Rhetinangium_ the primary tracheids form larger and fewer groups. The\r\ninner cortex is composed of thin-walled cells with many secretory sacs:\r\nthere are no stereome elements. In the outer cortex (fig. 449, _cr_)\r\nradially disposed bands of stereome form a reticulum with narrow and\r\nvery long meshes like that of Medullosan petioles.\r\n\r\nThe recently recorded occurrence of polydesmic petioles[471] in\r\n_Heterangium_ is of special interest from the point of view of the\r\ncomparison of that genus with _Rhetinangium_ and the Medulloseae.\r\n\r\nThe very broad decurrent petiole-bases are a striking feature, the\r\nmajor diameter of the pulvinus-like base of the leaf-stalk exceeding\r\nthat of the stem (fig. 449, _p_). Several xylem-strands from the\r\nperipheral region of the primary xylem go to form a single leaf-trace:\r\nthese U-shaped strands of xylem destined for a leaf are connected\r\nlaterally by parenchyma and form an irregularly corrugated band. Fig.\r\n450 shows a petiole-trace still enclosed on each side by the secondary\r\nxylem cylinder _x²_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 449. _Rhetinangium Arberi_ Gord. Transverse\r\nsection of stem with large leaf-base; _cr_, outer cortex of stem; _p_,\r\npetiole. (After Gordon; × 1¾.)]\r\n\r\nThere are several protoxylem groups in a leaf-trace, one on the outer\r\nface of each xylem-strand. In the petiole the xylem groups are more\r\nintimately connected and the trace has the form of a flat band with\r\nabaxial protoxylem. There is no indication that a leaf-trace undergoes\r\ndivision into separate strands. The roots are described as tetrarch\r\nwith well-developed secondary xylem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 450. Transverse section of leaf-trace of\r\n_Rhetinangium Arberi_ showing the exarch structure; _x²_, secondary\r\nxylem. (After Gordon.)]\r\n\r\nThe primary xylem of _Rhetinangium_ agrees in its exarch structure with\r\nthe Palaeozoic genera _Sutcliffia_, _Megaloxylon_ and _Stenomyelon_,\r\nalso with _Lygodium_ and some other recent Ferns: the secondary wood\r\nis of the manoxylic type like that of _Lyginopteris_, _Heterangium_\r\nand other genera. In the general structure of the stele _Rhetinangium_\r\nagrees with _Sutcliffia_ and, except in the exarch structure of\r\nthe primary xylem, with the steles of _Heterangium_ and _Medullosa\r\nanglica_[472]; but the structure and origin of the leaf-traces are\r\ncharacters which mark it off from _Sutcliffia_. The sclerenchymatous\r\nbands in the inner cortex of _Heterangium_ are unrepresented in\r\n_Rhetinangium_, and in the latter genus the abundance of secretory sacs\r\nand ducts is a characteristic feature, moreover in _Rhetinangium_,\r\nthe leaf-trace consists of several groups of primary xylem-elements.\r\nDr Gordon regards _Megaloxylon_ as the type which comes nearest to\r\n_Rhetinangium_; but the differences in the structure of the secondary\r\nwood and the marked contrast between the leaf-traces are too pronounced\r\nto justify a preference for _Megaloxylon_ over _Heterangium_ in the\r\norder of affinity. Gordon considers that the undivided leaf-trace of\r\n_Rhetinangium_ may represent a form transitional between the simple\r\nleaf-trace of _Lyginopteris_ and the much divided type in _Medullosa_.\r\nThe external position of the protoxylem is a character to which too\r\nmuch weight may easily be attached: the difference in position between\r\nthe protoxylem of _Rhetinangium_ and _Heterangium_ is in some examples\r\nof the latter genus hardly perceptible. Kubart[473] speaks of the\r\nstele of his species _Heterangium Sturi_ as being almost exarch.\r\nThe inconstancy in the position of the protoxylem in the xylem of\r\nOsmundaceous stems and in the primary bundles of _Eristophyton_ and\r\nother Palaeozoic genera is worthy of consideration in this connexion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 451. _Stenomyelon tuedianum_ Kidst. Transverse\r\nsection of stem. The black patches represent leaf-traces. (After\r\nKidston; × 1½.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=STENOMYELEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Stenomyelon.= Kidston.\r\n\r\n_Stenomyelon tuedianum_ Kidston. The specimens on which this monotypic\r\ngenus is founded[474] were obtained from the Lower Carboniferous\r\nrocks (Calciferous Sandstone series) at Norham Bridge, Berwickshire,\r\nScotland. They consist of petrified pieces of a flattened stem, a\r\nfragment of a rachis and portions of laminae: there is no evidence as\r\nto the nature of the reproductive organs. The original form of the stem\r\nis obscured by the destruction of a considerable part of the cortex and\r\nthe consequent flattening of the whole with the production of wing-like\r\nextensions of the imperfectly preserved tissues enclosing the almost\r\ncylindrical stele (figs. 451, 452).\r\n\r\nThe stele consists of a bluntly triangular core of primary xylem,\r\n3–4 mm. in diameter, composed almost entirely of reticulately pitted\r\ntracheids reaching a diameter of 160μ: a few parenchymatous cells\r\noccur in the peripheral region and a band of parenchyma extends from\r\nthe middle of each of the three sides of the xylem to the centre of\r\nthe stele, thus dividing the primary conducting tissue into three\r\ngroups which are the expression of a phyllotaxis of ⅓. The tracheids\r\nnear the outer face of each xylem-group are narrower than the others\r\nand have scalariform pitting. The secondary xylem first appears along\r\nthe slightly concave sides of the primary stele, eventually enclosing\r\nthe whole: it consists of tracheids with multiseriate pits on the\r\nradial walls and numerous deep medullary rays 1–6 cells broad. No\r\nphloem is preserved though it is probable that a narrow band was\r\noriginally present. A characteristic feature is afforded by a zone of\r\nthick-walled cells, regarded as periderm, encircling the stele and\r\nformed by a deep-seated phellogen. On the outer face of this band there\r\nare projecting bosses, and similar sclerous nests are scattered in the\r\ncortex. The outer cortex has a _Sparganum_[475] type of hypoderm, that\r\nis long vertical strands of fibres alternating with parenchyma. The\r\nleaf-traces are formed from the blunt angles of the primary xylem; an\r\nangle becomes nipped off as a more or less cylindrical strand enclosed\r\nby a zone of secondary tracheids which is very narrow on the adaxial\r\nside (fig. 452). Protoxylem was recognised only in the leaf-traces and\r\nnot in the rest of the stele. A pair of protoxylem strands occurs on\r\nthe outer edge of a prominent angle of xylem before it becomes detached\r\nfrom the stele, and these form a single strand at a lower level. As a\r\nleaf-trace passes outwards, the exarch xylem strand becomes mesarch\r\nand there is a single protoxylem group except at a point near the\r\nbifurcation of a trace. In its passage through the cortex a leaf-trace\r\ndivides repeatedly, the secondary xylem on the outer face of each\r\nstrand being retained for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nOur meagre knowledge of the nature of the leaves is based on incomplete\r\nfragments found in association with the stem. The leaf is believed to\r\nhave been simple and characterised by a thick lamina with a hypodermal\r\nzone of sclerous strands and several vascular bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 452. _Stenomyelon tuedianum_. Transverse section\r\nof stele. (After Kidston; × 7.)]\r\n\r\nAs Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan[476] remark, _Stenomyelon_ is a very\r\ndistinct type; while resembling _Sutcliffia_ in some respects it\r\ndiffers from that genus not only in the structure of the primary\r\nstele but in the absence of the system of meristeles which form so\r\ncharacteristic a feature of the latter genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CYCADOXYLEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Cycadoxylon.= Renault.\r\n\r\nThis generic term[477] is applied to a few types of Permian and Upper\r\nCarboniferous stems possessing a vascular cylinder, which may reach a\r\nconsiderable breadth, of secondary centrifugally developed xylem and\r\nphloem enclosing a large pith containing either a narrow, peripherally\r\nplaced, and more or less continuous cylinder of inversely orientated\r\nconducting tissue or scattered bands of centripetal xylem and phloem.\r\nThe secondary xylem is manoxylic, while the internal vascular tissue\r\nrecalls that of _Ptychoxylon_ and to a less extent the inverted arcs\r\nthat are rarely met with in _Lyginopteris_ stems. A brief diagnosis\r\nof two species may serve to illustrate the genus: a third species is\r\nincluded in _Cycadoxylon_, but it is founded on material too incomplete\r\nto admit of satisfactory diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadoxylon Fremyi_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThis Permian species[478] is represented by a piece of stem 2–2·5\r\ncm. in diameter (fig. 453, B) characterised by (i) a fairly broad\r\nparenchymatous cortex with secretory canals and several hypodermal\r\nnests of sclerous tissue, (ii) a cylinder of secondary xylem and phloem\r\nnearly the whole of which is centrifugal, (iii) a large pith containing\r\nseveral scattered narrower bands or arcs of centripetally developed\r\nxylem and phloem. The tracheids, with 4–6 series of hexagonal pits,\r\nform radially disposed rows, 1–4 elements broad, separated by broad and\r\ndeep medullary rays. Renault does not mention the occurrence of any\r\nprimary xylem as distinct from the secondary centrifugal xylem, but\r\nin a section which I examined some years ago in his laboratory there\r\nappeared to be a group of primary tracheids. There are no anastomoses\r\nbetween the main cylinder and the internal bands of inversely\r\norientated tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadoxylon robustum_ (Seward).\r\n\r\nThis species[479] is based on a piece of stem from the Lower Coal\r\nMeasures of Lancashire first described by Williamson and identified\r\nas an unusually large example of _Lyginopteris_. Williamson and\r\nScott, while recognising certain features in addition to the large\r\nsize of the stem, which must have reached 14 cm. in diameter,\r\nexpressed the view that ‘there is a presumption that it really\r\nbelonged to a _Lyginodendron_, or to some plant of the same type\r\nof structure.’ The examination of additional material led me to\r\nadopt the name _Lyginodendron robustum_, though I suggested\r\nthat possibly _Cycadoxylon_ might be the more appropriate genus.\r\nSubsequently Scott[480] proposed the substitution of _Cycadoxylon_ for\r\n_Lyginodendron_.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen consists of secondary xylem agreeing closely in\r\nstructure with _Lyginopteris_ and recent Cycads: the pith, 2·9 cm.\r\nin breadth, is incompletely preserved; there is a narrow band of\r\ncentripetal xylem[481] at the periphery of the perimedullary region\r\nand close to the inner face of the main mass of wood (fig. 453, C;\r\nthe black line marks the position of the centripetal xylem). Nests of\r\nsclerous tissue and secretory canals are scattered in the medullary\r\nparenchyma and deeper in this region are arcs of secondary parenchyma,\r\npossibly periderm. In places the centripetal and centrifugal xylem\r\nare in contact and occasionally the tapered ends of the rows of\r\ncentrifugal tracheids merge into groups of primary xylem elements. The\r\npreservation in the central region is far from complete, and although\r\nthe occurrence of primary xylem groups is probable it cannot be said to\r\nbe positively established. At the inner edge of the centrifugal xylem\r\nand in tangential longitudinal sections a few leaf-traces are seen, but\r\nnothing is known as to the nature of the leaf-traces in their course\r\nbeyond the stele nor have we any data with regard to the leaves or\r\nreproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThis older species differs from _Cycadoxylon Fremyi_ in the limitation\r\nof the centripetal xylem to the outer portion of the pith and in\r\nthe presence of sclerous nests in the medullary region, though the\r\nlatter character is probably of no great taxonomic value. _Cycadoxylon\r\nrobustum_ approaches more closely to _Lyginopteris_, and although the\r\ndifferences are sufficient to justify a distinctive generic name, there\r\ncan be little doubt as to a fairly intimate relationship between this\r\ntype of _Cycadoxylon_ and _Lyginopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ptychoxylon.= Renault.\r\n\r\n_Ptychoxylon_[482] _Levyi_ Renault. Like many Palaeozoic genera founded\r\non anatomical features, _Ptychoxylon_[483] is represented only by\r\nstems, our knowledge of the leaves being confined to the leaf-traces\r\nin the stem which appears to have a phyllotaxis of ⅜. The stem of\r\nthis Permian species has a diameter of 5–6 cm.: the comparatively\r\nbroad cortex contains numerous secretory canals, but in place of\r\nhypodermal strands of stereome there is a superficial periderm. The\r\nvascular tissue, consisting of secondary xylem and phloem, assumes\r\ndifferent patterns at different levels. There is an outer vascular\r\ncylinder of centrifugally developed xylem and phloem; the xylem is\r\nmanoxylic and the tracheids have 3–5 rows of bordered pits on the\r\nradial walls. At intervals the continuity of the main stele is broken\r\nby the formation of leaf-gaps and before one gap is repaired a second\r\nmay be produced, thus converting the cylinder into two crescentic and\r\ninfolded bands (fig. 453, A). A striking character is the occurrence\r\nin the large parenchymatous central region of internal vascular bands\r\nor arcs varying in size and number at different levels and composed\r\nof centripetally developed secondary xylem and phloem. These internal\r\nbands differ from the outer and broader cylinder both in their inverse\r\norientation and their limited vertical range. The connexion between\r\nthe inner and outer vascular tissue and the alteration in plan of the\r\nconducting tissue at different levels are illustrated by fig. 453,\r\n1–4, simplified from some of Renault’s figures of successive sections\r\nthrough a vertical distance of 4–5 cm. In section 1 the main cylinder\r\nis continuous except for a small gap where a leaf-trace is about to be\r\ngiven off: there are three internal vascular bands similar in structure\r\nto the outer stele but inversely orientated. At a higher level (section\r\n2) the leaf-gap is larger and in it is a double leaf-trace of two\r\ncollateral strands consisting of primary centripetal xylem and a\r\nfan-like group of secondary xylem and phloem. The free edges of the\r\nouter stele of section 1 have curved inwards and united with the two\r\nlateral medullary bands, while the lower internal band of section 1\r\nhas increased in extent and forms a discontinuous arc with the upper\r\nportions enclosed by the loops formed by the infolded ends of the outer\r\nvascular tissue. In section 3 a second leaf-gap has been formed in\r\nthe outer stele and its invaginated ends have fused with the internal\r\nbands. In section 4 the first leaf-gap is closed and the invaginated\r\nbands of section 3 have broken up into an irregular circle of shorter\r\nbands. The section reproduced in fig. 453, A, shows the main cylinder\r\nin the form of two curved and flattened loops, each composed partly\r\nof the centrifugally developed xylem and phloem of the main stele\r\nand in part of the inversely orientated tissue of the inner bands.\r\nAt a lower level the two bands _b_, _b_, will become detached as the\r\nupper leaf-gap is closed and form part of an inner cylinder like the\r\ndiscontinuous ellipse formed by the two bands _c_. The section of a\r\nbranch-stele is seen at _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453.\r\n  A. _Ptychoxylon Levyi_; transverse section of stem; _a_, stele of\r\n     branch.

(Simplified from Renault.)]\r\n\r\n_Ptychoxylon_ differs considerably from _Medullosa_, which Renault\r\nincluded in the _Cycadoxyleae_, in the plan of the vascular system:\r\nthere is nothing corresponding to the ‘partial pith’ or primary region\r\nwhich forms the central portion of the plate- and snake-rings in\r\n_Medullosa_. The double leaf-trace and the absence of the _Medullosa_\r\ntype of hypoderm are other distinguishing features. The paired\r\nleaf-bundles suggest comparison with _Lyginopteris_ among other\r\ngenera and, as Scott[484] points out, the internal arcs of inversely\r\norientated tissue which sometimes occur in the peripheral region of\r\nthe pith of _Lyginopteris_ (fig. 405, C, _c_) behave like the internal\r\nbands of _Ptychoxylon_ in occasionally joining the main cylinder at a\r\nleaf-gap; but the differences outweigh the resemblances. As regards the\r\ngeneral arrangement of the vascular tissue in two irregular concentric\r\ncircles and their connexions with one another, but not in the structure\r\nof the xylem and phloem, there is a similarity between this genus\r\nand such a Fern as _Matonia_. In the varying patterns formed by the\r\nvascular system at different levels in the stem _Ptychoxylon_ resembles\r\nthe Ferns _Polypodium quercifolium_ and _P. heracleum_[485].\r\n\r\n\r\n=CALAMOPITYEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Calamopitys.= Unger.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Unger[486] described several fragmentary petrifactions from\r\nThuringian strata of Upper Devonian age, the majority of which he\r\nreferred to the Calamarieae and the Rhachiopterideae. In an earlier\r\npublication[487] he gave a list of species including two families,\r\nthe Haplocalameae and the Calamoxyleae, assigned by him to the\r\ngroup Calamarieae: in the Haplocalameae he placed the new genera\r\n_Kalymma_, _Calamosyrix_, _Calamopteris_, and _Haplocalamus_. These\r\nwere subsequently examined by Graf Solms-Laubach and identified as\r\nportions of petioles, for the most part belonging to unknown stems.\r\nIn his second family, the Calamoxyleae, Unger included the single\r\ngenus _Calamopitys_ represented by the type-species _C. Saturni_. The\r\ntype-specimens have been thoroughly investigated by Solms-Laubach[488]\r\nwho instituted the family-name Calamopityeae and recognised a close\r\nanatomical affinity between _Calamopitys_ and _Lyginopteris_, a\r\nconclusion which led to the incorporation of Unger’s genus in the\r\nPteridosperms. Further data have been supplied by Zalessky[489]\r\nand, more recently, by Scott and Jeffrey[490] who have recognised\r\n_Calamopitys_ in Lower Carboniferous beds in Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calamopitys Saturni_ Unger.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of this and other species is confined to stems and\r\npetioles. One of the largest examples of the species is a piece of\r\nstem with a diameter of 1·5 cm.: the single stele consists of a\r\nparenchymatous pith enclosed by secondary xylem made up of tracheids\r\nwith 4–8 rows of bordered pits and medullary rays more than one cell\r\nbroad and of considerable depth. Between the inner edge of the wood\r\nand the pith are groups of primary xylem (fig. 454, B, _x_) which,\r\nlike those in _Lyginopteris_, constitute the leaf-traces: each has a\r\nsingle internal protoxylem strand (fig. 455, B). The comparatively\r\nwide cortex consists of parenchyma with a hypoderm of the _Sparganum_\r\ntype. Each primary xylem-strand passes out as a single leaf-trace\r\nthrough the secondary xylem and on emerging divides into two as in\r\n_Lyginopteris_: these branch in the cortex and the two are replaced by\r\nsix in the leaf-base (fig. 454, B–D). As seen in figs. 454, C, 455, A,\r\nthe boundary between the stem proper and the decurrent leaf-base is\r\nmarked by a line of stereome strands. The petioles of _Calamopitys\r\nSaturni_ agree generally in structure with the imperfect specimens on\r\nwhich Unger founded his genus _Kalymma_[491], so named in reference\r\nto the structure of the hypodermal zone. A specimen described by\r\nSolms-Laubach as a _Kalymma_ petiole occurs in organic connexion with\r\na stem of _Calamopitys_ (fig. 454, C: a detached petiole is shown in\r\nfig. 454, D). The identification by White[492] of this attached petiole\r\nwith Unger’s _K. grandis_ has been confirmed by Scott and Jeffrey. A\r\nfuller account of _Kalymma_ (fig. 456) is given on a later page, as the\r\npetioles so named belong to more than one species of stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 454. _Calamopitys Saturni._ B, stem with\r\nleaf-base; _x_, primary xylem and pith; black patches represent\r\nleaf-traces; C, stem with two leaf-bases; D, section of petiole.

(After Zalessky.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Calamopitys Saturni_ we have a plant agreeing with _Lyginopteris_\r\nin the possession of secondary xylem of the manoxylic type and in the\r\nstructure of the common primary bundles, while it is distinguished\r\nfrom _Lyginopteris_ by the greater number and by the structure of the\r\nbundles in the axis of the leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calamopitys annularis_ (Unger)[493].\r\n\r\nThis species, originally assigned to the genus _Stigmaria_, has\r\na more strongly developed primary vascular system and there is a\r\nmore decided tendency towards the formation of a continuous zone of\r\nprimary xylem on the inner edge of the secondary wood; but where\r\nthe protoxylem tracheids occur the metaxylem elements form definite\r\nstrands, like those of _C. Saturni_. It has been pointed out by\r\nScott and Jeffrey that there is some evidence of the occurrence of\r\ntracheids in the parenchymatous pith of this species, an important\r\nfeature distinguishing it from _C. Saturni_ and connecting it with _C.\r\namericana_. Information with regard to the behaviour of the leaf-traces\r\nis far from complete, but there are indications that each trace divides\r\ninto two before emerging from the secondary xylem[494]. The leaf-traces\r\nin the cortex are concentric as in _C. Saturni_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calamopitys americana_ Scott and Jeffrey.\r\n\r\nThis Lower Carboniferous species[495] from the Waverley shales\r\nof Kentucky is represented by portions of stems and leaf-bases\r\nand detached petioles. The secondary wood consists of tracheids,\r\n30–60μ in diameter, with deep and broad rays; the small pits on the\r\ntracheids form 5–6 alternating series. Phloem and cambium are very\r\nimperfectly preserved. The outer cortex is of the same type as in other\r\nspecies. At the inner edge of the secondary xylem there is a ring of\r\nprimary xylem strands of mesarch structure composed of rather larger\r\ntracheids, 80–120μ in diameter, separated from one another by narrow\r\nstrips of parenchyma. So far the vascular tissue agrees with that of\r\n_C. annularis_. In the American species the axial region is not a\r\nparenchymatous pith but a protostele, consisting of parenchyma and a\r\nlarger or smaller number of tracheal groups, the number being less in\r\nstems with a larger central region. The peripheral strands alone are\r\nconcerned with the emission of leaf-traces, as in _Heterangium_. Each\r\nprimary xylem strand divides into two as it leaves the perimedullary\r\nzone and passes through the secondary xylem as two bundles, each being\r\naccompanied by an arc of secondary tracheids which, in the cortical\r\nregion, completely surrounds the primary elements. At a later stage the\r\nsingle protoxylem of each trace divides into two and before entering\r\nthe leaf-base there is a further division. In some specimens leaf-bases\r\nof the _Kalymma_ type were found attached to the stem. The occurrence\r\nof tracheids in the axial region is a distinguishing feature and\r\nsuggests a comparison with _Heterangium_, while _C. Saturni_ agrees\r\nmore closely with _Lyginopteris_; the species _C. annularis_ would\r\nappear, from the recent observations of Scott and Jeffrey, to occupy an\r\nintermediate position.\r\n\r\n_Calamopitys_, as the generic designation is here employed, is confined\r\nto central Germany and Kentucky and occurs in Upper Devonian and\r\nLower Carboniferous strata. There is, however, some doubt as to the\r\nexact geological horizon of the rocks in both countries though in\r\nneither case is there any question of an horizon higher than Lower\r\nCarboniferous. Certain specimens from the Lower Carboniferous of\r\nScotland described by Scott[496] as species of _Calamopitys_ have been\r\nmade by Zalessky the type of a new genus, _Eristophyton_, and are dealt\r\nwith under that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kalymma._ Unger.\r\n\r\n_Kalymma grandis_ (petiole of _Calamopitys_). Under the generic name\r\n_Kalymma_ Unger described specimens from Thuringia of Upper Devonian\r\nage which he assigned to two species, _K. grandis_ and _K. striatum_.\r\nSolms-Laubach has shown that _Kalymma_ is not an independent stem\r\nas Unger believed but a petiole of _Calamopitys_, and this has been\r\nconfirmed by Scott and Jeffrey who found a leaf-base with the _Kalymma_\r\ntype of structure in connexion with a piece of _Calamopitys_ stem,\r\nprobably _C. americana_. An examination of a section (2·3 cm. broad)\r\nof Unger’s _K. grandis_ in the collection of the Geological Survey\r\nenables me to confirm the conclusions recently published by Scott and\r\nJeffrey. The best specimens of _Kalymma_, which appear to be identical\r\nin essential features with Unger’s type-species, are from Kentucky,\r\nsome from the Genessee shales of Upper Devonian age and others from\r\nbeds (Waverley shales) believed to be Lower Carboniferous. Through\r\nthe kindness of Prof. Bower I have had an opportunity of examining\r\nsections from the older horizon in his possession. The transverse\r\nsection reproduced in fig. 456 has a diameter of 3·8 × 2·2 cm.[497]: on\r\none side the radially placed plates of stereome are clearly shown, and\r\nin the outer portion of the ground-tissue is a ring of vascular bundles\r\nvarying in size and shape but with a general tendency to a radially\r\nelongated form. The ground-tissue consists of homogeneous parenchyma:\r\nin one place I noticed what appeared to be a large secretory canal,\r\nbut secretory tissue, generally at least, is unrepresented. The xylem\r\nis composed of imperfectly preserved elements, which appear to have\r\nscalariform pits; spiral protoxylem strands, embedded in the metaxylem\r\nas two or four groups, occur near the ends of the long axis of the\r\nbundle and in some cases also near the centre. The phloem probably\r\nsurrounded the xylem, though it is not certain whether the arrangement\r\nwas collateral or concentric: there are no secondary-xylem tracheids,\r\nthough in some places I noticed a tendency to a radial disposition\r\nof cells at the periphery of the vascular tissue simulating an early\r\nstage of secondary growth. Unger’s second species _Kalymma striata_ is\r\ncharacterised by an arrangement of the bundles similar to that in a\r\npetiole described by Scott and Jeffrey as _Calamopteris Hippocrepis_\r\nwhich differs from _Kalymma_ in the partial substitution of bands\r\nof vascular tissue for separate bundles and to some extent in the\r\ndisposition of the bundles. The two types of petiole _Kalymma_ and\r\n_Calamopteris_, as Scott and Jeffrey state, are very closely allied.\r\nDawson and Penhallow[498] have also described _Kalymma grandis_ from\r\nKentucky but they, like Unger, mistook the hypodermal stereome for an\r\nouter zone of vascular bundles. The petioles from Germany and North\r\nAmerica included under the name _Kalymma grandis_, though too similar\r\nto be referred to different species, no doubt represent petioles of\r\nstems which are unquestionably distinct types: as in the case of\r\n_Myeloxylon_ in its relation to the genus _Medullosa_, _Kalymma_ stands\r\nfor several closely allied forms of petioles belonging to several\r\nspecies of _Calamopitys_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 456. _Kalymma grandis._ (From a section in the\r\npossession of Prof. Bower; × 4.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eristophyton.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\n_Eristophyton fasciculare_ (Scott). The generic name\r\n_Eristophyton_[499] was proposed by Zalessky[500] for two incomplete\r\nstems of Lower Carboniferous age provisionally[501] referred by Scott\r\nto _Araucarioxylon_ and subsequently to _Calamopitys_[502]. The species\r\n_E. fasciculare_ was founded on material obtained by Dr Kidston from\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous of Dumbarton, Scotland, and on a specimen in\r\nthe Williamson collection from Northumberland. There is a small pith of\r\nparenchyma, 2–3 mm. in diameter, with eight strands of primary xylem\r\nof varying diameter (fig. 457) and in each a single protoxylem-group.\r\nThe primary xylem elements are considerably larger than the secondary\r\ntracheids. These xylem-bundles are leaf-traces and their disposition\r\npoints to a phyllotaxis of ⅖. The traces attain their maximum size\r\nwhen about to pass out through the secondary xylem. The tracheids are\r\nreticulate and scalariform while some have an intermediate type of\r\npitting. A leaf-trace on reaching the pith gradually moves further\r\nfrom the xylem-cylinder and may be separated from it by 2–6 layers\r\nof parenchyma: as it passes down the pith the protoxylem strand\r\nassumes an almost endarch position consequent on the reduction of the\r\ncentripetal xylem. In Scott’s words, ‘each circummedullary strand\r\nbranches at regular intervals; the one branch, that on the anodic\r\nside [turned towards the course of the genetic spiral], becomes the\r\nleaf-trace and passes out, while the other continues its course\r\nup the stem as a reparatory strand, until the next leaf of the\r\northostichy has to be supplied[503].’ The secondary xylem consists\r\nalmost entirely of tracheids with 3–4 rows of pits on the radial walls\r\nand medullary rays usually one cell broad varying in depth from 1\r\nor 2 to 16 or more cells. A characteristic feature of the secondary\r\nxylem is the occurrence on its inner face of numerous short and broad\r\ntracheae similar to the still larger tracheae in the primary stele\r\nof _Megaloxylon_[504]. Nothing is known as to the behaviour of the\r\nleaf-trace in the extrastelar region, but the fact that an outgoing\r\ntrace was found to have two protoxylems points to a subdivision similar\r\nto that of the foliar bundles of _Calamopitys Saturni_. A well-marked\r\ndifference between _Eristophyton fasciculare_ and _Calamopitys_ and\r\n_Lyginopteris_ is the more compact structure of the secondary wood;\r\nit is pycnoxylic and not manoxylic. Prof. Zalessky in criticising the\r\nuse of the generic title _Calamopitys_ puts forward several arguments\r\nin support of his institution of a new designation: (i) the primary\r\nxylem strands of _Eristophyton_ are not confined to the periphery of\r\nthe pith as is the case in _Calamopitys Saturni_, though he speaks of\r\none leaf-trace in the latter species separated by several layers of\r\ncells from the xylem-cylinder; (ii) some of the pith-cells have thick\r\nwalls and dark contents in distinction to the homogeneous parenchyma\r\nof _Calamopitys_, a feature of little importance; (iii) the difference\r\nin the structure of the secondary wood already alluded to, though this\r\nloses some of its significance by the occurrence of narrower rays,\r\nmore like those of _Eristophyton_, in _C. annularis_; (iv) the more\r\nelliptical and broader pits in the secondary tracheids in place of the\r\nmore regular hexagonal form in _Calamopitys_. While admitting a certain\r\ndegree of relationship between the two types, Zalessky asserts that\r\nas yet we have insufficient evidence to justify their generic union.\r\nScott[505] maintains that Zalessky does not attach sufficient weight\r\nto the form and mesarch structure of the primary xylem bundles as a\r\nfeature common to both genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 457. _Eristophyton fasciculare._ Transverse\r\nsection showing the relation of primary (black) to secondary xylem.\r\n(After Scott.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eristophyton Beinertianum_ (Goeppert).\r\n\r\n1850. _Araucarites Beinertianus_ Goeppert, Mon.

The primary\r\nxylem strands are more numerous and smaller than in _E. fasciculare_\r\nand these increase in diameter as they approach the secondary wood. In\r\nplaces the primary xylem elements form a more or less continuous band\r\nas in _Calamopitys annularis_. The largest leaf-trace bundles at the\r\nperiphery of the pith are mesarch (fig. 458), but as each trace passes\r\ndown the pith the reduction in the centripetal xylem is carried further\r\nthan in _E. fasciculare_ until the xylem-strand becomes endarch in the\r\nlower part of its course. The secondary tracheids have usually two\r\ncontiguous rows of pits and the medullary rays are one cell broad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 458. _Eristophyton Beinertianum._ A strand of\r\nprimary xylem, showing the protoxylem, _px_, abutting on the secondary\r\nxylem. (× 35. After Zalessky.)]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the generic identity of the two species\r\nreferred to _Eristophyton_, but the question as to the degree of\r\naffinity to _Calamopitys_ is more difficult to settle. There is force\r\nin Zalessky’s contention that these two stems should not be retained in\r\n_Calamopitys_: the recently described American species, _C. americana_\r\nScott and Jeffrey, gives emphasis to the view that the restriction\r\nof _Calamopitys_ to the German (and American) types is the safer\r\ncourse. While _Calamopitys_ as thus restricted is almost certainly a\r\nPteridosperm, the inclusion of the types referred to _Eristophyton_ in\r\nthe same category rests on a more slender basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CLADOXYLEAE.=\r\n\r\nThis order was founded by Unger[507] for some imperfectly preserved\r\nstems from Palaeozoic strata in Thuringia and in it he included the two\r\ngenera _Cladoxylon_ and _Schizoxylon_. There is some doubt as to the\r\nprecise age of the Thuringian beds; they were assigned by Richter to\r\nthe Devonian system and subsequently placed in the Culm: Solms-Laubach\r\nin his later reference to Unger’s plants favours a Devonian\r\nhorizon[508]. Unger included the Cladoxyleae in the Lycopodiales,\r\nand though this conclusion is not accepted the position of the order\r\nis still uncertain. His genus _Schizoxylon_ has no claim to generic\r\nseparation from _Cladoxylon_. An inspection of the illustrations in\r\nthe memoir by Richter and Unger reveals a striking resemblance in the\r\nmain anatomical features between several types assigned to different\r\ngenera and distributed among the Cladoxyleae and Rhachiopterideae\r\n(a term first used by Corda for petrified rachises or petioles of\r\nferns) and other orders. Solms-Laubach[509], to whom our more accurate\r\ninformation as to Unger’s plants is chiefly due, is inclined to regard\r\nthe specimens referred by Unger to the genus _Arctopodium_ as young\r\nstems of _Cladoxylon_, and he draws attention to a close similarity\r\nbetween _Hierogramma_, another of Unger’s genera, and _Cladoxylon_.\r\nPaul Bertrand[510] goes further in considering that the following\r\ngenera represent one generic type, namely _Syncardia_ (fig. 459, F),\r\n_Hierogramma_, _Arctopodium_, _Cladoxylon_, and _Schizoxylon_. The same\r\nauthor interprets the fossils so named by Unger as stems and does\r\nnot agree with the inclusion of any of them in the Rhachiopterideae.\r\nWithout losing sight of the fact that Bertrand’s conclusion is\r\nnot based on proof but is the expression of a view suggested by a\r\nclose agreement in general anatomical plan, I venture to adopt the\r\ndesignation _Cladoxylon_ in a wide sense primarily on the ground\r\nthat Bertrand’s view is probably correct and in part for the sake of\r\nconvenience of description. As Unger’s species of _Cladoxylon_ differ\r\nfrom one another in features which may fairly be regarded as of minor\r\nimportance, they are included under one specific name.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cladoxylon=. Unger.\r\n\r\n_Cladoxylon mirabile_ Unger[511]. The following are regarded as\r\nspecifically identical with or closely allied to _Cladoxylon mirabile_:\r\n_C. dubium_, _Schizoxylon taeniatum_, _Hierogramma mysticum_,\r\n_Syncardia pusilla_, _Arctopodium insigne_ and _A. radiatum_[512].\r\n\r\n_i. Stems._ The stems assigned to _Cladoxylon_ are characterised by a\r\ncomplex system of steles, either simple or branched and occasionally\r\nanastomosing, presenting in transverse section the form of oval or\r\ncylindrical strands or narrow, straight or curved bands arranged on\r\na more or less clearly marked radial plan (fig. 459, A, B, D). In\r\nsome stems the primary vascular tissue is enclosed by secondary xylem\r\nand phloem (fig. 460, B), while in others (Unger’s _Arctopodium_,\r\n_Hierogramma_[513], _Syncardia_) there is no evidence of secondary\r\nthickening. The diagrammatic drawing represented in fig. 459, F, shows\r\na section of a small axis, regarded by Unger and Solms as a petiole (3\r\nmm. in diameter), containing four vascular strands composed exclusively\r\nof primary xylem, each with one or, in the case of a double strand,\r\ntwo protoxylem groups. This type may be a slender stem or branch\r\nor possibly a petiole. The other extreme, as regards complexity of\r\nvascular structure, is represented by such stems as those shown in\r\nfig. 459, A, B, D. In Unger’s _Cladoxylon mirabile_ (fig. 459, A;\r\nfig. 460, B) the stem reaches a diameter of 3 cm. and consists of\r\nseveral radially disposed plates of vascular tissue with an occasional\r\nsmaller oval or cylindrical stele embedded in a ground-tissue composed\r\nof thick-walled cells. The plates are curved like a UU or sinuous\r\nand not infrequently anastomosing. In a section of this type figured\r\nby Unger the vascular plates appear to form a complex anastomosing\r\nsystem, but Solms[514] states that the drawing exaggerates the amount\r\nof fusion between the strands, and an examination of a section in the\r\ncollection of the English Geological Survey cut from Unger’s specimen\r\nenables me to confirm this statement. Each vascular plate consists of a\r\nnarrow median region composed of primary tracheids with a scalariform\r\ntype of pitting surrounded by secondary tracheids with interspersed\r\nmedullary rays one cell broad. The thickness of the secondary xylem\r\nvaries considerably in the same specimen and in places this tissue\r\nis hardly represented, a fact of importance in view of the very\r\nstriking resemblance between _Arctopodium_ and _Cladoxylon_, the\r\nsections referred by Unger to the former genus having steles without\r\nany secondary xylem. The occurrence of one or two elongated spaces\r\n(shown in black in fig. 459, A) near the distal end of each plate mark\r\nthe position of the protoxylem tracheids. Fig. 459, C, represents a\r\nstele of a stem referred by Unger and by Solms to _Cladoxylon dubium_\r\nwhich shows the typical _Cladoxylon_ structure, namely the central\r\nprimary xylem with distally placed protoxylem and the enclosing sheath\r\nof secondary xylem. In the stem shown in fig. 459, D (_C. dubium_)\r\nthere are 12 steles, each constructed on the plan already described,\r\ndiffering in their relatively broader and shorter form and in the\r\ngreater breadth of the secondary xylem from those seen in fig. 459,\r\nA (_C. mirabile_). The black areas in fig. 459, A, show the primary\r\nxylem, and the protoxylem is seen in fig. 459, C. A stem described by\r\nDawson[515] as _Asteropteris noveboracensis_ from Devonian beds is\r\ncompared by him with Unger’s _Cladoxylon mirabile_ and regarded as\r\npossibly allied to it. The radial plates of xylem in Dawson’s plant\r\nmeet in the centre like those of _Asterochlaena_ and the leaf-traces\r\nare of the Clepsydropsoid type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 459. A, _Cladoxylon mirabile_, section of stem;\r\nB, _Cladoxylon taeniatum_, section of stem; C, _Cladoxylon dubium_,\r\nsection of stele; D, _C. dubium_, section of stem; E, _Cladoxylon (?)\r\nmirabile_, section of petiole; F, _Syncardia pusilla_; G, development\r\nof leaf-trace in _Cladoxylon taeniatum_. (A–E, after Solms-Laubach; F,\r\nafter Unger; G. after P. Bertrand.)]\r\n\r\nThe type of stem for which Unger founded his genus _Schizoxylon_ is\r\nrepresented in fig. 459, B; there are five small steles in the centre\r\nand external to these eleven radially arranged plates, with oval steles\r\nbetween them, in the peripheral region of the stem. Each stele consists\r\nof primary (black in the figure) and secondary xylem and agrees with\r\nthe steles in the other stems.\r\n\r\nFrom the type of stem illustrated by _Cladoxylon mirabile_ to that on\r\nwhich the genera _Arctopodium_[516] and _Hierogramma_[517] were founded\r\nis a very small step: the vascular tissue has the same characters\r\nboth as regards gross and minute anatomy, but there is no evidence of\r\ncambial activity in the stems referred to the two latter genera, a\r\ndifference in itself hardly worthy of generic recognition.\r\n\r\nii. _Leaves._ Before describing a second type of stem referred to\r\n_Cladoxylon_ it is important to consider briefly such evidence as we\r\nhave as to the vascular supply of the leaves. Nothing is known of the\r\nreproductive organs and there is no satisfactory information with\r\nregard to the form of the fronds. Solms-Laubach has described the only\r\nknown example of a lateral branch of a _Cladoxylon_ stem (fig. 459,\r\nE): this has a single concentric vascular strand of plate-like form\r\nwith two blunt projections and there are four protoxylem-groups, two\r\nin the angle of the plate and two at the base of the projections. The\r\nstructure is essentially fern-like; the xylem is wholly primary. This\r\ntype of vascular strand agrees fairly closely with that of a petiole\r\ndescribed by Unger as _Megalorhachis elliptica_, a section of which\r\nis in the Museum of the Geological Survey[518]. The petiole is oval\r\nin section and laterally winged, and the meristele is tangentially\r\nelongated and has two blunt projections almost identical with those in\r\nfig. 459, F. There is no evidence as to the nature of the supporting\r\nstem, but there can be little doubt as to the close connexion with\r\n_Megalorhachis_ and the section shown in fig. 459, F. In a note\r\npublished in 1908 P. Bertrand stated that he had identified several\r\nof Unger’s genera as stems which bore leaf-traces having the form and\r\nstructure of _Clepsydropsis_, one of the types referred by Unger to the\r\nRhachiopterideae and described in the second volume of this work[519]\r\nas a Coenopteridean petiole. Bertrand points out that in the oval or\r\nplate-like steles of _Cladoxylon_, _Arctopodium_, _Hierogramma_, etc.,\r\nthere is a single protoxylem group near the distal end of the primary\r\nxylem, and he adds that the leaf-traces were formed of strands cut\r\noff from the distal portions of the vascular plates. Similarly the\r\nhour-glass-like leaf-trace in the primary rachis of _Clepsydropsis_\r\ngives off from each end a ring of xylem to supply a secondary rachis.\r\nThese laterally detached annular strands are, he believes, similar to\r\nthe leaf-trace cut off from the steles in a _Cladoxylon_ stem. The\r\nconclusion is that _Cladoxylon_ is a fern stem and its leaf-trace\r\nrepresents the simplest form of the _Clepsydropsis_ type, namely an\r\noval bundle of xylem with a central protoxylem, which is also the form\r\nof the trace given off from the stem of _Asterochlaena_. Solms[520],\r\nwhile admitting that Bertrand may be correct in uniting under one\r\ngenus _Cladoxylon_ and such types as _Syncardia_, _Hierogramma_, and\r\n_Arctopodium_, disagrees with the view that they are _Clepsydropsis_\r\nstems. A Clepsydropsoid leaf-trace has never been found in direct\r\nassociation with any of the stems of the _Cladoxylon_ type and such\r\nevidence as there is indicates a leaf-trace of an entirely different\r\nform (fig. 459, E). In his more recent memoir on _Asterochlaena_\r\nBertrand[521] draws attention to Solms’ figures of a stele of\r\n_Cladoxylon_ (fig. 459, C) in which the distal portion is on the point\r\nof being separated as a small annular strand. This, Bertrand considers,\r\nwould gradually become converted into a _Clepsydropsis_ form of stele\r\nas it passed to the petiole. Bertrand’s drawings made from a section\r\nof _Cladoxylon taeniatum_ (Ung.) (fig. 459, G) illustrate successive\r\nstages in the departure of a leaf-trace from one of the plate-like\r\nsteles of the stem (fig. 459, B). In fig. 459, G, 1, a piece of the\r\nstele is detached and near its extremity is a group of thin-walled\r\ncells with protoxylem: a later stage is seen in fig. 2, and in fig. 3\r\na small ring of xylem is being detached which, Bertrand assumes, would\r\nlater in its course be converted into the Clepsydropsoid strand (fig.\r\n4), which consists of primary tissue. The weak point in Bertrand’s\r\ncontention[522] is the absence of any proof of a true Clepsydropsoid\r\ntrace in connexion with a _Cladoxylon_ stem, and there is a strong\r\nprobability that the leaf-trace of _Cladoxylon_ has the form shown in\r\nfig. 459, E.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cladoxylon Kidstoni_ Solms-Laubach[523].\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on imperfectly preserved material in Dr Kidston’s\r\ncollection from Lower Carboniferous rocks in Berwickshire, is referred\r\nto _Cladoxylon_ on evidence that cannot be regarded as convincing.\r\nThe type-specimen consists of a small piece of stem about 3 cm. in\r\nbreadth showing three complete oval steles and portions of two others\r\nwhich seem to be in their original position and probably formed part\r\nof a series of peripheral steles such as those shown in fig. 459, D.\r\nEach stele consists mainly of secondary xylem (fig. 460, A) with some\r\ncrushed tissue, presumably phloem, on its outer face. The secondary\r\nxylem is narrower on the inner side of each stele where a wedge-shaped\r\npiece is partially detached. In the centre there is a narrow area\r\nparallel to the long axis of the stele containing crushed tissue which\r\nprobably consists of parenchyma and primary xylem, but the preservation\r\nis very imperfect. The secondary xylem has a fairly compact structure\r\nand the rays are narrow, 1–10 cells in depth. The pits of the tracheids\r\nare described by Solms as scalariform with occasionally two rows\r\nof elliptical pits on the radial walls. A careful examination of\r\nthe type-specimen leads me to describe the pits as uniseriate and\r\ntransversely elongated, very like those of _Protopitys_, or biseriate\r\nand almost circular like those of Conifers, the pits of the two rows\r\nbeing alternate or sometimes opposite (fig. 460, C): in places three\r\nrows of bordered pits are present. There is a certain degree of\r\nresemblance between the steles of this species and those of the South\r\nAfrican stem _Rhexoxylon_[524], but the data are inadequate for a\r\nsatisfactory comparison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460.\r\n  A, C. A single stele and tracheids of _Cladoxylon Kidstoni_. (Kidston\r\n        Coll. 630 B, 630 C.)\r\n  B. _Cladoxylon mirabile_, part of a stele. (Museum of Practical\r\n        Geology, 15872.)]\r\n\r\nThere is a close similarity between the vascular systems of\r\n_Cladoxylon_ and _Medullosa_, but an obvious difference is the\r\nsubstitution of the oval, transversely elongated, pits on the xylem\r\nelements for the multiseriate pitting of _Medullosa_. In _Cladoxylon\r\nKidstoni_ the pitting shows transitional forms between a narrow\r\nscalariform uniseriate type and a biseriate or triseriate arrangement\r\nsimilar to that in the Araucarineae and Cordaitales. In _Cladoxylon_,\r\nas limited by Unger, the presence of secondary wood is a generic\r\nfeature, but by the inclusion of _Arctopodium_ and other forms this\r\ncharacter no longer holds good. The inclusion of these more fern-like\r\nstems without secondary xylem brings _Cladoxylon_ (in the wider sense)\r\ninto closer contact with _Asterochlaena_, a comparison previously\r\nsuggested by more than one author. In _Medullosa_ the development\r\nof secondary xylem is on a larger scale than in _Cladoxylon_, and\r\nthe vascular system of the former genus assumes a more complex form.\r\nMoreover the _Myeloxylon_ type of petiole, which is a distinctive\r\nfeature of _Medullosa_, differs widely from any form of leaf-trace\r\nassociated with _Cladoxylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Völkelia.= Solms-Laubach.\r\n\r\n_Völkelia refracta_ (Goeppert). The generic name _Völkelia_[525] was\r\nproposed by Solms-Laubach[526] as a substitute for _Sphenopteris_[527]\r\nin the case of some petrified stems or petioles associated with\r\nfragmentary impressions of fronds from Lower Carboniferous rocks in\r\nSilesia. Both leaf-impressions and petrifactions were included in the\r\ngenus _Sphenopteris_: Solms, while retaining Goeppert’s designation for\r\nthe leaf fragments, proposed a new generic name for the petrifactions\r\non the ground that there is insufficient evidence of their connexion\r\nwith the leaves. The short account of Goeppert’s petrified specimen\r\ngiven by Graf Solms-Laubach in his ‘Fossil Botany[528]’ is supplemented\r\nby a fuller description in a later paper. The fragments of highly\r\ncompound fronds are characterised by very small filiform ultimate\r\nsegments, but the specimens are too imperfect to afford a clear idea of\r\nthe habit of the leaf. The ‘stem’ bears a close superficial resemblance\r\nto that described by Unger as _Cladoxylon dubium_ (fig. 459, C, D) and\r\nwas regarded by him as an example of that species: it contains several\r\nradially placed steles represented by fairly well-preserved xylem,\r\nbut no phloem has been recognised. The steles vary in size and shape:\r\nfive reach almost to the centre (fig. 461, A) and smaller xylem groups\r\noccupy a peripheral position. Each stele is excentric in structure and\r\nconsists of (i) an outer zone of secondary tracheids of horse-shoe\r\nform in transverse section, but the apparent gap in the secondary\r\nxylem on the outer edge of each stele is due to the crushing of the\r\ntracheal tissue and to its smaller breadth in the distal part of each\r\ngroup; this is shown in fig. 461, B, where the apparent gap is seen to\r\nbe occupied by distorted and crushed tracheids, _a_, identical with\r\nthose which form the rest of the outer zone (fig. 461, B, _b_); (ii)\r\na zone of tracheal tissue continuous with and originally identical\r\nin appearance—except that the elements are rather narrower—with the\r\nouter secondary xylem; (iii) an excentrically situated island composed\r\nof tracheids enclosing a small central area occupied by thin-walled\r\nparenchyma. This third region, represented by black patches in fig.\r\n461, A, in all probability represents the primary part of each stele\r\nto which the rest of the tissue has been added by the cambium. A\r\nstriking feature of the secondary xylem is the absence of medullary\r\nrays: the tracheids resemble those of _Cladoxylon_ and _Protopitys_\r\nin the transverse elongation of the pits (fig. 461, D) which form\r\neither a single row or several irregularly distributed rows. The\r\nprimary xylem consists in the peripheral region of tracheids with very\r\nnarrow scalariform pitting which at first sight suggest close spiral\r\nbands (fig. 461, C), while the inner tracheids are either annular or\r\nreticulate and associated with elongated parenchyma. The imperfectly\r\npreserved ground-tissue appears to consist of homogeneous parenchyma\r\nwith radially disposed bands of stereome in the outer cortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 461. _Völkelia refracta._ A.

Longitudinal\r\nsection showing the median protoxylem. D. Tracheid from the secondary\r\nxylem. (After Solms-Laubach.)]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of _Völkelia_, though far from complete, justifies its\r\ngeneric separation from _Cladoxylon_ from which it differs in the\r\nlack of medullary rays and in the structure of the primary portion\r\nof each stele. In the form and arrangement of the pits in the\r\nsecondary tracheids _Völkelia_ differs from _Medullosa_ and resembles\r\n_Cladoxylon_. The opinion expressed by P. Bertrand[529] that _Völkelia_\r\nis probably the stem of one of the Zygopterideae is based on the older\r\naccounts of the genus and not on the fuller description of 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PROTOPITYEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Protopitys.= Goeppert.\r\n\r\nThe only species so far described is that for which Goeppert founded\r\nthe genus in 1850, substituting _Protopitys_[530] for the name\r\n_Araucarites_, adopted in an earlier paper, on the ground that\r\nthe structure of the xylem denoted a distinct generic type. The\r\ntype-species is from the Upper Devonian rocks of Falkenberg in Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protopitys Buchiana_ Goeppert.\r\n\r\n1845. _Araucarites Buchianus_ Goeppert, in Wimmer’s Flor.

He recognised the narrow, transversely\r\nelongated, pits on the radial walls of the tracheids as a feature of\r\nspecial interest indicating a type of pitting transitional between that\r\nof Ferns and Conifers. A further description was given by Kraus[531]\r\nwho included under Goeppert’s name both the Falkenberg stem and a\r\nsecond specimen from Basel though the latter is Triassic in age and\r\na distinct plant; he suggested a comparison of _Protopitys_ with\r\n_Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_ rather than with Conifers. It is, however,\r\nto Graf Solms-Laubach[532] that we owe the most thorough account of\r\nthis species. Nothing is known of the leaves or reproductive organs.\r\nThe largest piece of stem is nearly 1 ft in diameter and consists\r\nmainly of secondary xylem resembling that of Conifers and _Cordaites_\r\nexcept in the form of the bordered pits on the radial walls of the\r\ntracheids (fig. 462, D). The centre of the stem is occupied by a\r\nparenchymatous pith, elliptical in transverse section, enclosed by\r\na band of primary xylem composed of large polygonal tracheids (fig.\r\n462, C, _x_¹) characterised by a delicate scalariform pitting on all\r\ntheir walls (fig. 462, E). The primary xylem forms a narrow layer on\r\nthe sides of the ellipse, 1–3 elements broad (fig. 462, A, B), but it\r\nincreases in breadth at the ends of the long axis where the tracheids\r\nare intermixed with parenchyma. The primary xylem and pith-tissue at\r\nthe ends of the major axis of the central region assume different\r\nforms at different levels, owing to the detachment of leaf-traces and\r\nthe consequent formation of foliar gaps as portions of the primary\r\nxylem pass obliquely outwards into the secondary xylem on the way to\r\nthe distichously arranged alternate leaves. The diagram, fig. 462, A,\r\nshows the inner part of the secondary xylem (see also fig. 462, C, x²)\r\nwhich at one end, _lt_, has formed an oval group about to pass out as\r\na leaf-trace: at the opposite end the strand is detached and divided\r\ninto two equal branches. The two swellings of the primary xylem ellipse\r\nshown at _a_ in figs. 462, A and B, are a characteristic feature:\r\nthese are clearly seen after the leaf-trace has become detached;\r\nat the inner edge of each of them there appears to be a protoxylem\r\nstrand. After the formation of a foliar gap these swellings of the\r\nxylem gradually meet and so re-establish continuity below the outgoing\r\nleaf-trace. No protoxylem has been detected in the actual trace, which\r\nis believed to be concentric. The formation of the leaf-gap and the\r\nshoulders bordering it constitute interesting filicinean features,\r\nrecalling corresponding characters in solenostelic Ferns. At the\r\nupper end of the diagram, fig. 462, B, the outgoing leaf-trace is\r\nundergoing dichotomy while at the opposite end the trace has passed\r\nout of view. The secondary xylem shows incomplete rings or arcs of\r\nnarrower elements, which at first sight give the impression of annual\r\nrings: the occurrence of similar incomplete or pseudo-rings is a common\r\nfeature in _Lepidodendron_ and other Palaeozoic stems. The secondary\r\ntracheids (54·4μ in tangential diameter, 68·5μ in radial diameter) have\r\nusually a single series of broadly oval bordered pits on the radial\r\nwalls with here and there two rows (fig. 462, D). In one case only were\r\nthe pits of the medullary rays recognised (fig. 462, F). The rays are\r\nuniseriate, generally 1–2 cells deep, but occasionally 3 cells in depth\r\nand very rarely deeper. The cambium is of the normal type, and in some\r\nspecimens secondary phloem was found consisting of bands, 4–5 layers\r\nbroad, of stone-cells alternating with tubular thin-walled elements,\r\npresumably sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462. _Protopitys Buchiana_. A, B. Central region\r\nof the stem showing the pith, the primary xylem (black in fig. A) and\r\n(A) the inner part of the secondary xylem; _a_, shoulders of xylem\r\nat the leaf-gaps; _lt_ leaf-trace; _px_ protoxylem. C. Secondary,\r\n_x_², and primary xylem, _x_¹. D. Radial longitudinal section of the\r\nsecondary xylem. E. Scalariform tracheid of the primary xylem. F. Pits\r\non the medullary-ray cells. (After Solms-Laubach.)]\r\n\r\nAs Solms-Laubach says, it is highly probable that each leaf-trace,\r\nwhich forks close to its exit from the primary xylem, became further\r\nsubdivided before reaching the leaf. Morphologically, _Protopitys_ is\r\nof special importance as a type possessing characters that indicate a\r\nconnexion with Conifers or Cordaitean genera, notably the structure\r\nof the secondary wood, while the presence of foliar gaps is a feature\r\nreminiscent of Ferns. The primary xylem resembles that of some of\r\nthe Palaeozoic arborescent Lycopodiales, but in _Protopitys_ the\r\ninterruptions in this tissue are due to the emission of leaf-bundles,\r\nwhereas in the discontinuous primary xylem of some Sigillarias[533]\r\nthe gaps have no connexion with leaf-traces. Moreover the distichous\r\nleaves of _Protopitys_ and the larger, branched, leaf-traces are other\r\ndistinguishing features. The pitting of the primary xylem is like\r\nthat in the Lycopodiales and Filicales, while that of the secondary\r\nwood shows a closer approach to the coniferous type. A comparison\r\nmay also be made with the transversely elongated pits of _Cladoxylon\r\nKidstoni_[534].\r\n\r\nA piece of wood agreeing anatomically with the Silesian species of\r\n_Protopitys_ has been found in the Yoredale rocks of England[535].\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the genus have been emphasised by Solms-Laubach\r\nby the institution of a family-name Protopityeae: the genus is\r\nessentially a generalised type exhibiting in the structure of its stem\r\nboth Filicean and Coniferous features. The bordered pits differ from\r\nthose in recent Conifers in their flatter form, but in this respect\r\nthey exhibit a closer agreement with the transversely stretched pits of\r\n_Xenoxylon phyllocladoides_ Goth.[536], a Mesozoic species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n                             CORDAITALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. =POROXYLEAE=.\r\n\r\n=Poroxylon=. Renault.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Renault[537] briefly summarised the anatomical features of\r\nsome silicified vegetative shoots from the Permian of Autun for which\r\nhe instituted a new family, the Poroxyleae. The more complete account\r\ncontains a description of two species, _Poroxylon Boysseti_ and\r\n_P. Duchartrei_: the latter was afterwards recognised as a stem of\r\n_Heterangium_. Renault considered this new genus to be closely allied\r\nto _Sigillaria_ and _Sigillariopsis_ and pointed out its resemblance\r\nto _Cordaites_. Additional species have since been described but as\r\nyet the genus has not been found outside France in Permo-Carboniferous\r\nstrata of Autun and the St Étienne district. The results of a more\r\ndetailed investigation of the anatomy of the genus were published by\r\nBertrand and Renault in 1882 and since then[538] Bertrand, Renault,\r\nand Scott have added to our knowledge of this interesting type. In\r\nseveral respects _Poroxylon_ stems present a striking resemblance to\r\n_Lyginopteris_, but the recent discovery of the genus _Mesoxylon_ has\r\ngiven greater significance to the characters in which _Poroxylon_\r\nagrees with representatives of the Cordaitales. Our knowledge of\r\nthe genus, though exceptionally full with regard to the anatomy of\r\nvegetative shoots, does not include any precise information as to the\r\nreproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThe slender cylindrical stems, not exceeding 2–3 cm. in diameter in\r\nspecimens so far recorded, bore large broadly linear leaves similar\r\nin form and venation to those of some species of _Cordaites_ which\r\nwere attached singly to slightly swollen nodes separated from one\r\nanother by internodes several centimetres long. The base of the\r\nrather fleshy lamina passes imperceptibly from the narrow lower\r\nportion into a tangentially expanded petiole which forms a decurrent\r\nridge on the stem. Axillary buds frequently occur. Little is known\r\nof the leaf-impressions, but if Grand’Eury[539] is correct in his\r\nidentification of certain specimens from French Stephanian beds as the\r\nleaves of _Poroxylon_, the lamina reached a length of 1 met. and a\r\nbreadth of 15–20 cm. In habit the stems probably resembled some of the\r\nlarger-leaved Bamboos. The only evidence bearing on the nature of the\r\nreproductive organs is furnished by Grand’Eury who believes that some\r\n_Rhabdocarpus_ seeds and bractless inflorescences associated with the\r\nleaves assigned to _Poroxylon_ belong to that genus.\r\n\r\nThe single cylindrical stele has a relatively large solid pith, the\r\nperimedullary region being characterised by the occurrence of a row\r\nof primary crescentic strands of centripetal xylem of exarch type,\r\nthough not improbably in some cases slightly mesarch, varying in\r\nsize and shape and forming single or paired bundles. These strands\r\nrepresent the xylem of collateral leaf-traces similar to those of\r\n_Lyginopteris_ but differing in the absence of well-defined centrifugal\r\nelements: the curved form of some of the xylem strands gives them an\r\nappearance similar to that of the leaf-traces of _Lyginopteris_. The\r\nleaf-traces, except in the lower part of their course through the pith,\r\nare double and pass through several internodes before the centripetal\r\ntracheids die out. The secondary xylem (fig. 463) is manoxylic and very\r\nsimilar to that of _Lyginopteris_ though rather less parenchymatous.\r\nThe secondary phloem and cambium are often very well preserved. No\r\nendodermis and no distinct pericycle has been recognised. The cortex\r\nis parenchymatous and, like the pith and to some extent the phloem,\r\ncontains numerous secretory sacs; in the outer cortex the presence of\r\nhypodermal strands is a prominent feature. At an early stage in the\r\ngrowth of the stem a deep-seated phellogen forms secondary tissue both\r\nexternally and internally and decortication ensues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 463. _Poroxylon Edwardsii_. A. Transverse section\r\nof stem. B. The central region of another stem of the same species. (A,\r\n× 9; University College Collection; B, from a photograph supplied by\r\nProf. Bertrand of a specimen in the Renault Collection, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nThe bundle of each leaf-trace is accompanied by an arc of secondary\r\ncentrifugal xylem as it passes through the secondary wood and this is\r\nretained in the leaf except in the finer veins. After entering the\r\npetiole the leaf-trace branches and an arc of bundles is produced, the\r\nconcave side facing the upper surface of the thick lamina (fig. 464,\r\nA). Further reference is made to the structure of the leaves in the\r\ndescription of _Poroxylon stephanense_. The specimens of roots so far\r\ndescribed are characterised by a diarch plate of primary xylem and two\r\nmasses of secondary vascular tissue separated by two medullary rays\r\nopposite the protoxylems. Bertrand mentions the occurrence of roots of\r\n_P. stephanense_ with more than two protoxylem strands. The phellogen\r\nwas produced in the pericycle as in the roots of recent Gymnosperms. It\r\nis suggested by Lignier[540] that some silicified rootlets from Grand’\r\nCroix (Loire) described by him as _Radiculites reticulatus_ and at\r\nfirst compared with roots of _Sequoia_ may belong to some Cordaitalean\r\nplant, possibly _Poroxylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poroxylon Edwardsii_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThis species[541] affords a good illustration of the generic\r\ncharacters already summarised. The strap-like leaves are fleshy\r\nand the occasionally forked, parallel or slightly divergent, veins\r\nare embedded in a homogeneous mesophyll with hypodermal strands of\r\nmechanical tissue. The pith consists of parenchyma in vertical series\r\nwith scattered secretory sacs and differs from that of _Cordaites_\r\nand _Mesoxylon_ in the absence of transverse discs. There are 13\r\nprimary-xylem strands close to the inner edge of the secondary wood:\r\nthe centripetal tracheids are scalariform or have multiseriate pitting\r\nlike that in the secondary xylem. The structure of the leaf-traces is\r\nclearly shown in fig. 464: the double trace seen in fig. 464, C, has\r\ntwo protoxylem-strands accompanied by some parenchyma, and these are\r\nalmost enveloped by the metaxylem tracheids which abut on the secondary\r\nwood. At this stage in its course, that is just before bending\r\noutwards, the centripetal xylem reaches its maximum development and the\r\ntrace forms a prominent and broad twin-strand in striking contrast to\r\nthe two narrower and tangentially extended strands shown in fig. 464,\r\nE, D. Each of these strands with a single protoxylem-group would at a\r\nhigher level assume the broader and more compact form and contain two\r\nprotoxylems as in fig. 464, C. The tracheids of the secondary xylem\r\nhave 4–7 alternate rows of contiguous alternate pits on the radial\r\nwalls: the medullary rays are 2–3 cells broad and may be 60 cells deep.\r\nAccording to Renault[542] several small oblique pits occur on the\r\nradial walls of the ray cells. The secondary phloem, separated by a\r\nnormal cambium from the xylem, forms a broad band of sieve-tubes with\r\nlateral sieve-plates like those in _Medullosa anglica_ alternating\r\nwith tangential rows of parenchyma. The cortex is relatively narrow\r\nand in older stems is chiefly occupied by secondary tissue formed from\r\ndeep-seated phellogens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464. _Poroxylon_.

(From\r\nphotographs supplied by Prof. Bertrand.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poroxylon Boysseti_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThe stems of this species agree closely with those of _P. Edwardsii_,\r\nthe chief difference being in the structure of the secondary phloem\r\nwhich does not show the regular concentric alternation of sieve-tubes\r\nand parenchyma.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poroxylon stephanense_ Bertrand and Renault.\r\n\r\nThis the oldest species, from Stephanian beds at Grand’ Croix,\r\ndiffers in no essential features from the other representatives\r\nof the genus. It is from a study of the leaves of this type that\r\nBertrand and Renault have obtained most of the facts with regard to\r\nthe anatomy of _Poroxylon_ foliage. In the median region of the fleshy\r\nleaf the bundles are characterised by a comparatively large amount\r\nof centripetal xylem accompanied by a considerable development of\r\nsecondary centrifugal tracheids: the bundles are connected laterally\r\nby both centripetal and centrifugal xylem and thus at certain levels\r\nin the lamina the vascular tissue has the form of a continuous plate\r\n(fig. 464, A, B). The veins become independent on branching and near\r\nthe edge of the lamina they consist only of primary elements. Secretory\r\nsacs of elongated form are scattered in the homogeneous mesophyll, and\r\nthick stereome-strands underlie the epidermis. The epidermal cells are\r\nrectangular and rows of stomata occur on both surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. =CORDAITEAE=.\r\n\r\n=Cordaites=. Unger.\r\n\r\nA preliminary statement with regard to nomenclature may serve to\r\nremove possible misconceptions in connexion with the application\r\nof the generic name _Cordaites_. It has been the general practice\r\nto apply this name to certain forms of linear leaves which are\r\nparticularly abundant in Carboniferous and Permian strata in Europe\r\nand North America, and in recent years a few palaeobotanists have\r\nsubstituted _Cordaites_ for _Noeggerathiopsis_ as the more suitable\r\ndesignation for Permo-Carboniferous specimens abundant in the rocks of\r\nGondwana Land. It has been customary to assign to _Cordaites_ certain\r\nreproductive shoots, seeds, and stems described under the generic\r\nnames _Cordaianthus_, _Cordaicarpus_, _Cordaicladus_, _Cordaioxylon_,\r\netc. Stems agreeing anatomically in their main features with those of\r\nrecent Araucarineae have long been attributed to _Cordaites_, but a\r\nfew years ago a new type of stem was discovered which, though almost\r\nidentical with that of _Cordaites_, is distinguished by the character\r\nof the primary xylem. For this new type the name _Mesoxylon_[543]\r\nwas proposed. Nothing is known as to the reproductive organs borne\r\non _Mesoxylon_ stems, but the leaves are externally at least\r\nindistinguishable from those referred to _Cordaites_. It is therefore\r\nobvious that when we apply the name _Cordaites_ to leaves or other\r\nplant-organs, under that designation are undoubtedly included specimens\r\nbelonging both to _Mesoxylon_ stems and to stems with the characters\r\nof _Cordaites_ (_Cordaioxylon_). Further research may enable us to\r\nsubdivide _Cordaites_ into more precisely defined types distinguished\r\nby well-marked morphological characters, but at present the only course\r\nwould seem to be to restrict the term _Mesoxylon_ to petrified stems\r\nexhibiting the features of that genus and to retain _Cordaites_ as a\r\ncomprehensive designation in accordance with the general account of the\r\ngenus given in the following pages. This widely distributed and mainly\r\nPalaeozoic genus is especially well represented in the coalfields of\r\nFrance where in some localities it contributed largely to the formation\r\nof seams of coal[544], and it is chiefly from the researches of French\r\nPalaeobotanists that our knowledge of its morphology is derived.\r\n_Cordaites_ has shared the fate of most other abundant fossil plants\r\nin the distribution of its _disjuncta membra_ among several genera\r\nand classes, but on the whole the information that is now available\r\nenables us to reconstruct the complete plant with a greater degree of\r\nconfidence than is usually attainable.\r\n\r\n_Cordaites_ may be described as a forest-tree closely resembling\r\nin habit and probably in size the recent Conifer _Agathis_, more\r\nespecially such species as _A. macrophyllus_, _A. vitiensis_ and others\r\nwith leaves considerably longer than those of the Kauri Pine (_A.\r\naustralis_)[545]. The main stem reached a considerable height before\r\ngiving off scattered branches bearing spirally disposed, sessile, and\r\noften crowded leaves[546] like the foliage of _Agathis_. The absence of\r\nany evidence of a two-ranked arrangement of leaves on lateral branches\r\nsuggests a general tendency towards a vertical rather than a horizontal\r\ndirection of growth. The sessile and closely set leaves for the most\r\npart of leathery texture vary considerably in length and breadth in\r\ndifferent types (figs. 466–472): in some the broadly linear lamina with\r\nits parallel veins and perfectly constructed I-shaped girders (fig.\r\n465) reached a length of nearly 100 cm., in shape like the blade of\r\na straight broad-sword or the leaves of a _Yucca_, torn by the wind\r\ninto strips; in other forms the lamina is shorter and more obovate,\r\nwhile in some the leafy shoots must have looked like slender stems of\r\nthe smaller-leaved Bamboos. There is no proof that young vegetative\r\nbranches with their spirally rolled leaves[547] were protected by\r\nbud-scales, but some oval triangular scales (fig. 468, C), occasionally\r\nfound in association with larger foliage-leaves, may have served that\r\npurpose. The branches from which leaves had recently fallen at the\r\ntime of fossilisation are characterised by transversely elongated\r\noval scars, occasionally showing a slightly curved row of pits like\r\nthe marks of leaf-traces on the scars of a Horse Chestnut, sometimes\r\nterminating a feebly projecting decurrent leaf-cushion (fig. 466, C).\r\nThe leaves persisted for a comparatively long period as in _Araucaria\r\nimbricata_, and on older leafless branches the scars are transversely\r\nstretched; the leaf-cushion loses its individuality and eventually the\r\ndevelopment of secondary cortical tissue causes the exfoliation of the\r\nsuperficial bark.\r\n\r\nIn the form and structure of the fertile shoots _Cordaites_ parts\r\ncompany with _Agathis_; the trees bore no cones in the ordinary sense,\r\nbut unisexual inflorescences—whether on one plant or on different\r\nindividuals is uncertain—were produced in the axils or from a\r\nsupra-axillary position as compound spikes or compact racemes. Both the\r\nlonger female shoots and the shorter and more compact male branches are\r\nconstructed on a similar plan. The ovulate inflorescence may exceed 30\r\ncm. in length (fig. 479); a stout axis bears two-ranked linear bracts\r\nsubtending short lateral bud-like shoots with one or several sessile\r\nor stalked ovules (fig. 480) between the sterile scales. The seeds\r\nare platyspermic and agree much more closely with those of Cycads\r\nand _Gingko_ than with the seeds of Conifers. The male inflorescence\r\nis on a smaller scale, in habit not unlike the elongated male shoot\r\nof _Cephalotaxus pedunculata_ and some other Conifers; each bract\r\nsubtends a small oval bud composed of imbricate scales and highly\r\nmodified microsporophylls borne singly or in clusters (figs. 481,\r\nF; 482). A microsporophyll consists of a comparatively long pedicel\r\nbearing at its apex a few long microsporangia. The term microsporophyll\r\nimplies a morphological interpretation which is not accepted by all\r\npalaeobotanists, some of whom prefer to regard the microsporangia as\r\nstamens or microsporophylls reduced to their simplest terms and sessile\r\non an elongated flower-stalk.\r\n\r\nThe stem agrees very closely in its more important features with that\r\nof an _Araucaria_ or an _Agathis_: the primary xylem forms the inner\r\nsurface of the thick cylinder of secondary wood, merging gradually into\r\nit as in recent Conifers; there are no separate bundles of primary\r\ncentripetal xylem. The medullary rays are narrow: in other words\r\nthe secondary xylem is of the pycnoxylic type. The pitting of the\r\ntracheids is Araucarian and, as in _Agathis_, the leaf-traces arise\r\nas twin-bundles. The pith is larger than in the Araucarineae and more\r\nhomogeneous in structure; it shares with the pith of _Juglans_ and some\r\nother recent plants an almost constant tendency to assume a discoid\r\nstructure. Anatomically the leaves agree more closely in the structure\r\nof the vascular bundles with Cycads than with Conifers though there are\r\npoints of contact with both of these classes. The roots branch freely\r\nand their horizontally extended arms (figs. 468, A; 478) suggest growth\r\nin swampy ground; anatomically they conform to the recent Gymnospermous\r\ntype and there is good evidence that in some cases fungal mycelia lived\r\nsymbiotically in the cortex of coralline rootlets.\r\n\r\nSternberg[548] figured some leaves of _Cordaites_ from Carboniferous\r\nrocks in Bohemia under the generic name _Flabellaria_ in the belief\r\nthat they belonged to a Palm. Brongniart substituted a new name\r\n_Pycnophyllum_[549] on the ground that Corda had disproved the\r\nsupposed relationship with Monocotyledons. The name _Cordaites_ was\r\ninstituted by Unger[550], his definition being based on leaf-form as\r\nwell as on stem-anatomy. It has recently been proposed to revive the\r\nforgotten designation _Pycnophyllum_[551], but the reasons given are\r\nhardly likely to induce botanists to discard the familiar generic\r\nname which perpetuates the memory of Corda. As already pointed out,\r\nthe name _Cordaites_, even though employed in what has always been\r\nregarded a legitimate sense, is no doubt often given to specimens\r\nof some other allied member of the Cordaitales which can only be\r\nrecognised as such in the case of more completely preserved material.\r\nThe naming of wood of the Cordaitean type, but which may equally well\r\nbelong to another genus, raises a difficult question: if there is\r\nsatisfactory evidence from collateral sources that the wood is that\r\nof a _Cordaites_ Grand’Eury’s name _Cordaixylon_[552] or Schenk’s\r\nform _Cordaioxylon_[553] may be used, though there seems to be no\r\nadequate reason against the use of the name _Cordaites_. If there is no\r\nconfirmatory evidence available and it is impossible to say whether the\r\nwood is that of a Conifer or a _Cordaites_, or some other plant with\r\nthe same type of secondary xylem, Endlicher’s term _Dadoxylon_[554] is\r\nmost conveniently employed. The confusion liable to follow from the\r\nuse of the two generic names _Dadoxylon_ and _Araucarioxylon_ for\r\nwood of the same type differing only in geological age is an argument\r\nin favour of extending _Dadoxylon_ to all specimens having certain\r\nanatomical characters, which cannot be certainly assigned either\r\nto the Araucarineae or the Cordaitales, irrespective of geological\r\nage. The term _Cordaicladus_ sometimes applied to branches is hardly\r\nnecessary, but the subgeneric names _Eu-Cordaites_, _Dory-Cordaites_,\r\nand _Poa-Cordaites_, instituted by Grand’Eury for different forms of\r\nleaf, are frequently employed and serve a useful purpose as descriptive\r\nterms though the characters which they connote are of small importance\r\nand by no means always well defined or constant. For inflorescences it\r\nis customary to adopt the name _Cordaianthus_ suggested by Grand’Eury\r\nas a substitute for _Antholithus_ and some other terms. The same author\r\nuses _Rhizo-Cordaites_ for roots.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of seeds is more difficult: in a few instances seeds\r\noccur in organic connexion with Cordaitean shoots, but there is no\r\ndoubt that many platyspermic Palaeozoic seeds preserved as detached\r\nfossils belong to _Cordaites_ or some other member of the group.\r\nThe difficulty is that in the present state of knowledge we cannot\r\ndefinitely determine in many cases whether a seed is Cordaitean or\r\nwhether it belonged to a genus of Pteridosperms. For this reason the\r\naccount of several seeds that were probably borne on _Cordaites_ or\r\nsome allied genus is given in a later chapter devoted to Gymnospermous\r\nseeds. There is no doubt that under the generic names _Cardiocarpus_,\r\n_Cordaicarpus_, and _Samaropsis_ are included true Cordaitean seeds,\r\nthough it would be incorrect to say that all the seeds so named belong\r\nto members of the Cordaitales.\r\n\r\n_Cordaites_ reached its maximum development in the Carboniferous and\r\nPermian periods; the genus or some closely allied types persisted into\r\nthe Triassic and Rhaetic periods, and there is reason to believe that\r\nthe group was represented in some post-Rhaetic floras. The genus is\r\none of many remarkable examples of the high degree of specialisation\r\nattained by Palaeozoic plants. The complex mechanisms represented by\r\n_Cordaites_ and similar types give force to the conviction that we\r\ncannot hope to penetrate below the higher branches of the genealogical\r\ntree which had its roots in a period of the earth’s history\r\ninaccessible to botanical investigation. The plants of the present\r\nage are to a large extent the result of evolutionary tendencies more\r\ncorrectly described as the result of degeneration or simplification\r\nthan as the latest phase in a series composed of a succession of\r\ntypes gradually growing in complexity. _Cordaites_ is essentially a\r\ngeneralised type, a composite product of an age characterised by an\r\nactivity in the elaboration of the complex from the simple. Botanical\r\nrecords furnished by the geological series available for investigation\r\nfurnish evidence of the sorting of characters among gradually\r\ndiverging races and of changes in plant-organisation tending towards\r\nsimplification and increased efficiency.\r\n\r\n_Cordaites_, using the generic designation in a wide sense, occurs\r\nin Carboniferous and Permian strata in Europe, North America, and\r\nChina; it is recorded from several localities in Russia and Siberia\r\nfor the most part from Permian rocks, from Permo-Carboniferous (Lower\r\nGondwana) beds in India, Australia, South Africa, and South America.\r\nWood agreeing generally in the structure of its secondary tracheids\r\nwith that of _Cordaites_ is represented in Devonian rocks, and\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the existence of Cordaitalean plants in\r\npre-Carboniferous floras. It is represented in the Rhaetic flora of\r\nTonkin and has recently been discovered in strata probably of Rhaetic\r\nage in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Leaves.+\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognise the fact that leaves included under\r\nthe generic name _Cordaites_ were in many cases not borne on stems\r\nor branches with the anatomical characters of _Cordaites_. Scott in\r\nhis account of the genus _Mesoxylon_ says, ‘I feel no doubt that\r\nmost of the British specimens of Cordaitean leaves really belong to\r\n_Mesoxylon_, which is a much commoner type of stem in the Coal Measure\r\npetrifications than that of _Cordaites_ itself[555].’ Some of the\r\nCordaitean leaves were probably attached to stems of the _Poroxylon_\r\ntype[556] and it is not improbable that, as investigations are\r\nextended, additional genera of vegetative shoots will be discovered\r\nprovided with leaves similar at least in external characters to those\r\nwhich it is customary to refer to _Cordaites_. In the present state of\r\nour knowledge we cannot make use of anatomical characters as criteria\r\nby which to distribute the foliage of the _Cordaites_ form among the\r\ngenera _Cordaites_, _Mesoxylon_, and _Poroxylon_, using these names as\r\ndesignations of certain types of anatomical structure. The specimen\r\nreproduced in fig. 465 is in all probability a piece of a leaf of\r\n_Cordaites principalis_, but on anatomical grounds Miss Benson[557]\r\nhas made it the type of a new species, _C. Felicis_, and more recently\r\nScott[558] has brought forward evidence supporting the view that it\r\nis a leaf of _Mesoxylon_. As, therefore, neither impressions nor\r\npetrifications of Cordaitean leaves can in the great majority of cases\r\nbe referred with confidence to their respective genera of stems,\r\npending fuller information the only course would seem to be to use\r\nthe name _Cordaites_ in a comprehensive sense indicating in special\r\ncases where evidence is available the more precise systematic position\r\nof the specimen. The classification of Cordaitean leaves proposed by\r\nGrand’Eury[559] is based partly on the form of the lamina and in part\r\non the equality or inequality of the ‘veins.’ The actual veins, which\r\nare embedded in the fairly thick mesophyll, do not directly affect the\r\nsuperficial ribbing on the carbonised impression of the leaves and, as\r\nseen in fig. 465, the most prominent hypodermal strands of supporting\r\ntissue which would appear as the main veins or primary ribs on an\r\nimpression do not correspond in position with the vascular bundles.\r\nAlthough in some cases the largest stereome-strands coincide with the\r\nveins, forming the upper and lower parts of I-shaped girders the centre\r\nof which is occupied by the veins, this is by no means always the case.\r\nGrand’Eury has drawn attention to the difference between the upper and\r\nlower surface of some carbonised leaves: in _C. crassifolius_ (fig.\r\n468, D)[560] there are five to seven finer ribs between each pair of\r\nprimary ribs on one face while the other shows ridges and grooves with\r\na rib corresponding to each. Attention is called on a later page to the\r\nvariable character of the ribbing even on different parts of the same\r\nlamina. The lower surface of the leaf, seen in section in fig. 465,\r\nwould show a number of approximately equal ribs, or possibly primary\r\nribs (midway between the veins) separated by two interstitial ribs,\r\nwhile on the upper face there would be three rather smaller secondary\r\nribs. In a section of a leaf called by Renault _C. crassus_[561], a\r\nspecific name used also by Lesquereux[562] for an impression of a\r\nleaf originally described by Goeppert as _Noeggerathia crassa_, there\r\nare deep stereome-strands between the veins next the lower epidermis\r\nalternating with single smaller strands, while on the upper surface\r\nthe hypodermal strands occur only immediately above the veins. In a\r\nsection figured by Felix[563] from North Germany as _C. robustus_,\r\nthe hypodermal stereome forms continuous bands; on the upper face the\r\nbands are uniform in thickness but next the lower epidermis they form a\r\nseries of ribs.\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury’s subgeneric terms _Cordaites_, _Dory-Cordaites_, and\r\n_Poa-Cordaites_ have therefore very little value as regards differences\r\nin the ribbing of leaf-impressions: the large size of leaves included\r\nin _Dory-Cordaites_ and the more acute apex of the lamina as compared\r\nwith the obtuse apex of smaller leaves of _Cordaites_ are features of\r\nlimited application and of minor importance as diagnostic characters.\r\nThe name _Poa-Cordaites_ is, however, usefully employed for the\r\nnarrower linear leaves with an obtuse apex.\r\n\r\nThe structure of a _Cordaites_ leaf is clearly shown in fig. 465; the\r\nlamina is approximately 1 mm. thick and there are about 30 veins in a\r\nbreadth of 2 cm. Strong I-shaped girders with the webbing composed of\r\nthick-walled cells divide the mesophyll into rectangular compartments:\r\nthe intervening hypodermal strands differ in number and size on the two\r\nfaces. The epidermis is not preserved: specimens of other leaves show\r\nthat the stomata[564] occur in rows on the lower surface. The mesophyll\r\nshows no differentiation into palisade and spongy parenchyma, and in\r\nthis respect the leaf agrees with many other forms; but in some leaves\r\nthe palisade-tissue is well developed, as in _C. lingulatus_ Ren.[565]\r\nThe central region of the lamina consisted of lacunar tissue, portions\r\nof which are preserved, with a more compact sheath of parenchyma\r\nenclosing each vein. In some leaves there is a narrower sheath of\r\nthick-walled cells more sharply contrasted with the mesophyll. The\r\nvascular bundles agree in structure with those in the rachis of a\r\nCycadean frond more closely than with the veins of an Araucarian\r\nor other Coniferous leaf. The xylem consists mainly of centripetal\r\nelements which form a deltoid strand with the protoxylem at the apex,\r\nand in close association with this is a larger or smaller amount of\r\nnarrower centrifugal tracheids: in the section shown in fig. 465 the\r\ncentrifugal xylem may extend all round the centripetal tracheids,\r\nbut it usually forms an irregular arch with its base attached to the\r\nsides of the larger tracheal strand, _cp_, separated, except at the\r\nbase of the arch, by a small amount of conjunctive parenchyma from the\r\ncentripetal xylem. The phloem is not preserved and is represented only\r\nby a few patches, _ph_, below the centrifugal tracheids. Dr Benson[566]\r\nin her account of this type of leaf gives additional details and\r\ncompares the anatomical features with those in other species. The\r\ndual nature of the xylem like that characteristic of recent Cycads\r\nhas usually been regarded as a definite feature of Cordaites leaves;\r\nDr Stopes, on the other hand, interprets the narrower tracheids\r\n(occupying a position similar to those in fig. 465) in some sections\r\nof a leaf identified with _C. principalis_ from Grand’ Croix, as an\r\ninner sheath of transfusion elements (‘primitive transfusion tissue’)\r\npossibly derived from the centripetal xylem with which it is clearly\r\nconnected at the sides precisely as in fig. 465; but in the Grand’\r\nCroix leaf the phloem is enclosed within the sheath of narrower\r\ntracheids and not external to it as it is in the section shown in fig.\r\n465 and in a section of _C. lingulatus_ figured by Dr Stopes. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult to recognise any fundamental difference between the\r\n‘inner transfusion tissue’ and centripetal xylem. The cells of the\r\nouter sheath in Dr Stopes’s specimens of _C. principalis_ have bordered\r\npits on their walls and this character is mentioned also by Renault in\r\nother specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 465. _Cordaites_ leaf (_Cordaites Felicis_\r\nBens.), probably borne on a _Mesoxylon_ stem. _cp_, centripetal xylem;\r\n_ph_, phloem; _px_, protoxylem. (Kidston Coll. No. 2194.)]\r\n\r\nProf. Lignier[567] has described the structure of fragments of adult\r\nleaves from the Stephanian of Grand’ Croix (Loire) which he refers\r\nto _Cordaites lingulatus_, and the same author gives an interesting\r\naccount of the anatomical features of a bud of the same species. The\r\nbud, which resembles in general appearance that of _Dolerophyllum_\r\n(fig. 430, p. 133) is 3 cm. long, oval in transverse section—as the\r\nresult of compression—and consists of four convolute leaves and a piece\r\nof a fifth. The outer leaves have 75 to 80 veins: the inner laminae are\r\nsinistral in their curvature while the three outer leaves are dextral.\r\nIn the second, the first in which the tissues are recognisable, the\r\nsmall desmogen-strands afford some evidence that the phloem preceded\r\nthe xylem in the order of differentiation as is often the case in\r\nrecent plants. The first tracheids occur almost in the centre of\r\nthe desmogen-strand and to these are added the other tracheids of\r\nthe centripetal xylem, the oldest elements being spiral, the next\r\nscalariform and the later tracheids reticulate. The centrifugal\r\nxylem is formed at a later stage, and at about the same time are\r\ndifferentiated the elements called by Dr Stopes the inner sheath and\r\nby Lignier the ‘bois diaphragmatique.’ Lignier also describes the\r\ndevelopment and structural features of the other tissues of the young\r\nleaves and compares the anatomical features of the French leaves with\r\nthose of _Cordaites Felicis_ described by Prof. Benson.\r\n\r\nThe main features of _Cordaites_ leaves are (i) the presence of two\r\nkinds of xylem in the veins, the larger centripetal tracheids, or chief\r\nwater-conducting elements, and the narrower tracheids, in some cases\r\nattached to the sides of the centripetal xylem, in others forming free\r\ngroups, usually between the protoxylem and the phloem, but sometimes\r\nenclosing the phloem; (ii) the frequent presence of a well-defined\r\nsheath of cells round each vein composed of comparatively thick-walled\r\nelements comparable with the transfusion-tracheids in Conifers; (iii)\r\nthe presence of lacunar tissue in the centre of the mesophyll and in\r\nsome cases of transversely extended tracheids similar to those in some\r\nPodocarp leaves; (iv) a well-developed system of stereome-strands\r\nand I-shaped girders. The structural features on the whole suggest a\r\nxerophilous type, and the frequent absence or feeble development of\r\npalisade tissue points to diffused rather than to brilliant sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe considerable range in size and form among Cordaitean leaves as well\r\nas the obvious dependence on conditions of preservation or growth of\r\nsuch a relatively unimportant feature as the presence or absence of\r\nthe so-called false or interstitial veins—the variability of which has\r\nbeen demonstrated in several instances—renders specific determination\r\nexceedingly difficult. The following species are briefly described\r\nrather with a view to illustrate the nature of the characters employed\r\nby authors than as implying the existence of so many well-defined types.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites principalis_ (Germar).\r\n\r\nThis species was founded[568] on a large specimen from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Wettin showing a fan-like cluster of longitudinally torn\r\nand partially overlapping leaves spread out in the position that\r\nwould be assumed on the compression of a shoot with a close spiral\r\nphyllotaxis. This form of _Cordaites_ is the most abundant in the\r\nBritish Coal Measures. The broadly linear lamina is characterised by an\r\nobtuse apex (fig. 466, A), a tendency to split into strips, close-set\r\nparallel ribs, the stouter ribs or veins separated from one another\r\nby 2–3 or it may be as many as 5 finer ribs or interstitial ‘veins.’\r\nA statement by Weiss that in Germar’s type-specimen the longitudinal\r\nribbing of the lamina is very imperfectly preserved confirms the\r\nscepticism that is justly felt as to the validity of this character as\r\na satisfactory specific criterion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 466. A. _Cordaites principalis_, part of leaf.\r\n_B. Artisia_ _transversa_, pith-cast. C. _Cordaites principalis_,\r\nbranch with leaf-scars. (A, ⅖ nat. size; B, C, nat. size; Kidston\r\nColl.)]\r\n\r\nThe incomplete example shown in fig. 466, A, is 19·5 cm. long and has\r\na maximum breadth of 3·5 cm., but the complete leaf was much larger\r\nand tapered gradually to the comparatively broad and slightly concave\r\nor amplexicaul base. The narrow elliptical proximal end of a specimen\r\nfigured by Kidston[569] from the Middle Coal Measures of Yorkshire is\r\n2·8 cm. broad indicating that the tangentially expanded leaf-scars on\r\na branch recently deprived of its foliage must have been a conspicuous\r\nfeature. In his synonymy of this species Kidston[570] includes _Knorria\r\ntaxina_, a species founded by Lindley and Hutton[571] on a piece of\r\nstem from the Coal Measures of Newcastle. The type-specimen, as Mr\r\nHowse[572] states, is much larger than the published drawing and\r\nclosely resembles in the decurrent leaf-bases with broad apices the\r\npiece of stem represented in fig. 466, C, which Kidston identifies as\r\n_C. principalis_. Geinitz[573] refers to this species the seeds named\r\n_Cordaicarpus Cordai_ (Gein.), but there is no evidence of connexion.\r\nKidston[574] points out that this seed is rare in Britain: he believes\r\nthat _Cordaianthus Pitcairniae_ (Lind. and Hutt.) is probably the\r\ninflorescence of _C. principalis_.\r\n\r\n_Cordaites principalis_ occurs in both Carboniferous and Permian\r\nstrata. The leaves described by Lesquereux[575] from Pennsylvania as\r\n_C. Mansfieldi_ agree closely with _C. principalis_. Another similar or\r\npossibly identical form is represented by _C. Ottonis_ Gein.[576]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites borassifolius_ (Sternberg).\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this species, originally referred to _Flabellaria_[577],\r\nresemble those of _C. principalis_ but differ in the ovate-lanceolate\r\nand less obtuse apex and in the presence of only one or rarely two\r\nfiner striations between the stronger ribs. Corda’s drawing[578]\r\naffords a good illustration of the crowded spiral disposition of the\r\nfoliage comparable with that on an _Agathis_ shoot. The lamina is\r\nusually 4–8 cm. broad but in exceptional cases may reach a breadth\r\nof 12 cm. The species occurs in the Coal Measures, especially in the\r\nWestphalian series and in Permian rocks. Feistmantel[579] unites with\r\nthis type _Cordaianthus Pitcairniae_ (fig. 480, A), but as in other\r\ncases there may be a confusion between _C. borassifolius_ and _C.\r\nprincipalis_. Leaves described by Lesquereux as _C. communis_[580]\r\nare, as White says, not distinguished by any well-marked characters\r\nfrom this species. White[581] figures some good examples of _C.\r\nborassifolius_ from Missouri, reaching in one case a length of 40 cm.,\r\nshowing on the lamina the fructifications of a fungus, _Hysterites\r\ncordaitis_[582] Grand’Eury. The leaves described from Canada and the\r\nUnited States as _C. Robbii_[583] Daws. are closely allied to if not\r\nidentical with Sternberg’s type. Among other species differing in\r\nno definite character from _C. borassifolius_ is _C. lancifolius_\r\ndescribed by Schmalhausen[584] from the Permian of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites lingulatus_ Grand’Eury.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this species[585] are characterised by the obovate\r\nlamina and bluntly rounded or almost truncate apex; it affords a\r\ngood illustration of the uncertainty of the ribbing as a diagnostic\r\ncharacter. The lamina of a well-preserved specimen from the Blanzy\r\ncoalfield described by Zeiller[586] reaches a length of 35 cm. and a\r\nbreadth of 10–11 cm. decreasing to 4 cm. at the base (fig. 467). In the\r\nlower part of the lamina Zeiller describes the ribs as unequal in\r\nprominence, the stronger ones being separated by 1–3 finer ribs, while\r\nin the middle and upper portions the ribs appear to be of equal size.\r\nSome of the finer ribs are due to folding of the lamina and are not\r\nrepresented, as are the ribs due to the presence of stereome-strands,\r\nby dark streaks in the detached cuticle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 467. _Cordaites lingulatus._ (After Zeiller; ⅚\r\nnat. size.)]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the anatomical features of leaves of\r\nthis species described by Lignier[587] and other authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites grandifolius_ Lesquereux.\r\n\r\nThe leaves so named by Lesquereux[588], from the Coal Measures of\r\nPennsylvania, are distinguished by the elongate cuneate lamina, which\r\nreaches a length of 38 cm. with a narrow base and a slightly rounded\r\ntruncate distal end, 16 cm. broad, characterised by a few broad and\r\nshallow crenulations. By contrast with some American specimens in Dr\r\nKidston’s collection Lesquereux’s figures convey an imperfect idea of\r\nthe size of the leaf. A large leaf from the Coal Measures of Belgium\r\ndescribed by Cambier and Renier as a new species of _Psygmophyllum_,\r\n_P. Delvali_[589], is perhaps identical with the American type; the\r\nlamina of sub-triangular form has approximately the same dimensions;\r\nthe veins are numerous and repeatedly forked. The leaf is much longer\r\nthan any known _Psygmophyllum_ and the veins are much more numerous\r\nthan in _P. majus_ Arb.[590], the largest representative of that genus.\r\nPalaeobotanists who have seen the type-specimen inform me that they\r\nhave no doubt as to the Cordaitean nature of the Belgian specimens,\r\nwhich may be designated _Cordaites Delvali_. It is, however, not\r\nimpossible that _Psygmophyllum_ and _Cordaites_ are allied genera: our\r\nknowledge of the former is limited to unimportant characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites_ (_Dory-Cordaites_) _palmaeformis_ (Goeppert).\r\n\r\nThis Permian type, originally described by Goeppert[591] as\r\n_Noeggerathia palmaeformis_, is characterised by numerous slender\r\nveins: according to Weiss[592] there may be as many as 3–5 in 1 mm.\r\nThe leaf is broadly lanceolate; it tapers gradually to an acute\r\napex reaching a length of 80 cm. and a breadth of 10 cm. In habit\r\nthe young foliage-shoots[593] resemble those of _C. principalis_ and\r\n_C. borassifolius_. Grand’Eury records the frequent association of\r\n_Samaropsis_ seeds with this species; it occurs in Upper Carboniferous\r\nand in Permian strata and is recorded from a few British localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites_ (_Poa-Cordaites_) _microstachys_ Goldenberg.\r\n\r\nWeiss[594] first figured this species from drawings supplied by\r\nGoldenberg at whose suggestion the name _C. microstachys_ was adopted.\r\nThe type-specimen consists of a slender axis bearing numerous narrow\r\nlinear leaves and a few imperfect fertile axillary shoots. A specimen\r\nis figured by Kidston[595] from the Upper Coal Measures of Radstock: it\r\nis a rare type in Britain. The species is readily distinguished from\r\n_C. principalis_ and similar forms by the narrow lamina which varies\r\nconsiderably in length, rarely as long as 30 cm. and not exceeding 1\r\ncm. in breadth. The apex is obtuse and the ribs are either equal in\r\nstrength or 1–2 finer striae may alternate with the stronger ribs. The\r\nbase of the lamina is 3–4 mm. wide and the leaf-scars have a slightly\r\narched upper margin and an almost straight lower edge[596]. The foliage\r\nof this species, generally regarded as identical with _C. linearis_\r\nGrand’Eury, bears a close resemblance to that of the Mesozoic genus\r\n_Phoenicopsis_ from which it is distinguished by the occurrence of the\r\nleaves in bunches.\r\n\r\n_C. gracilis_ Lesq.[597] is a similar type. The shoot on which\r\nLesquereux founded his genus _Desmiophyllum_[598] may perhaps be an\r\nexample of _Poa-Cordaites_. _Poa-Cordaites tenuifolius_ Schmal.[599]\r\nfrom the Permian of Russia may be identical with _C. microstachys_.\r\n\r\nAs examples of other forms of leaf referred to _Cordaites_, though as\r\nin other cases without any proof of connexion with branches having the\r\nanatomical features of the genus, reference may be made to _Cordaites\r\ncircularis_ Grand’Eury[600] from Gard (fig. 468, B) and a smaller leaf\r\nfrom the same locality compared with _C. Lacoei_ (fig. 468, C) Lesq.\r\n_Cordaites circularis_ is characterised by the almost orbicular lamina\r\ntraversed by slightly spreading veins; it recalls some of the larger\r\n_Cyclopteris_ pinnules of Pteridosperm fronds and is indistinguishable\r\nfrom some leaves assigned to the genus _Dolerophyllum_[601].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 468. A, _Cordaites_ root-system\r\n(_Rhizo-Cordaites_); B, _Cordaites circularis_ leaf; C, _Cordaites_\r\nsp., cf. _Cordaites Lacoei_; D, _Cordaites crassifolius_, upper and\r\nlower surface of leaf. (After Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\nThe species _C. Lacoei_ was founded by Lesquereux[602] on some detached\r\nspecimens 3–12 cm. long and 1·5–5 cm. broad; it is by no means certain\r\nthat a specimen referred by Grand’Eury[603] with some hesitation to\r\nthis species is Cordaitean.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Scuto-Cordaites_ was proposed by Renault[604] for\r\na specimen from Commentry consisting of a flattened branch bearing\r\na few imperfectly preserved leaves. The surface of the branch shows\r\nsemicircular leaf-scars on decurrent, spirally disposed leaf-cushions\r\nand bears a certain resemblance to a slender stem of a Clathrarian\r\n_Sigillaria_. The leaves of the type-specimen of _Scuto-Cordaites\r\nGrand’Euryi_ appear to be broadly linear, 13 cm. long, the breadth\r\ngradually increasing from the base: a short distance from the proximal\r\nend the lamina is broken up into narrow segments; the veins are ·5 mm.\r\napart with finer striations between them.\r\n\r\nSome specimens from Pennsylvania made by Dawson[605] the type of\r\na new sub-genus and named _Dictyo-Cordaites Lecoi_ agree in shape\r\nand arrangement with some species of _Cordaites_, but differ in an\r\noccasional anastomosis of the veins as in _Psygmophyllum flabellatum_.\r\nIt is, however, impossible to determine the true nature of the fossils\r\nfrom the published figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cordaitean leaves from India, the Southern Hemisphere, and Siberia.\r\n    _Noeggerathiopsis_, Feistmantel; _Rhiptozamites_, Schmalhausen;\r\n    _Euryphyllum_, Feistmantel.+\r\n\r\n{_Cordaites aequalis_ Goeppert.\r\n{_Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_) _Hislopi_ (Bunbury).\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Goeppert[606] instituted the species _Noeggerathia aequalis_\r\n(fig. 469) and _N. distans_ for incomplete broadly linear and\r\nobovate leaves, from Siberian Permian strata, having a contracted\r\nbase and equal parallel veins. The specimens so named are no doubt\r\nspecifically identical. Goeppert’s species _N. aequalis_ has recently\r\nbeen carefully investigated by Zalessky[607] who agrees with\r\nKosmovsky[608] in identifying it with _Noeggerathiopsis Hislopi_\r\n(Bunb.) and _Rhiptozamites Goepperti_ Schmal. Schmalhausen[609] had\r\npreviously pointed out the probable identity of his species with\r\n_Noeggerathia palmaeformis_ Goepp. (= _Cordaites_). The question of\r\nspecific identity of these leaves from different localities and of\r\nother hardly distinguishable forms is of secondary importance; the main\r\npoint is that they are all examples of Cordaitean leaves, _Cordaites_\r\nor some allied genus, and point to the existence of this group of\r\nGymnosperms during Permo-Carboniferous times in Siberia, China, India,\r\nAustralia, South Africa, and S. America, also in the Rhaetic floras\r\nof Tonkin[610] and Mexico[611]. The fragments from Devonian strata at\r\nIguana Creek, Australia, named by McCoy[612] _Cordaites australis_ are\r\nprobably pieces of the rachis of some large frond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 469. A–C, E, _Cordaites aequalis_; D, _Cordaites\r\nClerci_. (After Zalessky; ⅚ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nWieland[613] recently discovered Cordaitean leaves exhibiting a wide\r\nrange in size and shape in the Mixteca flora of Mexico in the lower\r\nmembers of a series which extends from the ‘upper borders of the\r\nRhaetic’ through the Liassic to the lower beds of the Inferior Oolite.\r\nThese leaves are referred to _Noeggerathiopsis Hislopi_, and it is\r\nclear from an examination of photographs received from Dr Wieland,\r\none of which is reproduced in fig. 470, that the Mexican _Cordaites_\r\ncannot be specifically distinguished from Bunbury’s type as represented\r\nby specimens described from India, South Africa, Siberia, Tonkin, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of _Noeggerathiopsis_ is also recorded by Newberry from\r\nthe Rhaetic series of Honduras[614].\r\n\r\n_Noeggerathiopsis._ This genus was founded by Feistmantel[615] for\r\nsome leaves from Lower Gondwana rocks in India originally described\r\nby Bunbury[616] as _Noeggerathia (Cyclopteris?) Hislopi_ (figs.\r\n470–472) and regarded by him as probably Cycadean. Several authors\r\nhave added to our knowledge of this widely spread southern type and\r\nin many localities the leaves occur in association with platyspermic\r\nseeds of the _Samaropsis_ or _Cordaicarpus_ type, pieces of stems with\r\nCordaitean leaf-scars, and petrified wood agreeing in the structure\r\nof the secondary xylem with that of European species of _Cordaites_.\r\nIn some Permo-Carboniferous sandstones at Vereeniging, South Africa,\r\nstumps and spreading roots (fig. 478) resembling those described from\r\nFrance by Grand’Eury (cf. fig. 468, A) have also been discovered. A\r\nremarkable occurrence of roots and prostrate stems of some forest-tree\r\nwas recorded some years ago in the bed of the Vaal river near\r\nVereeniging where the surface of a seam of coal was exposed over an\r\narea of more than two acres[617]. Large branched roots (fig. 478)\r\nspreading over the coal for a distance of several feet and thick stems\r\n40–50 ft in length with very few branches and but little decrease in\r\ndiameter afford a striking picture of a forest-floor. The frequent\r\noccurrence of _Cordaites (Noeggerathiopsis) Hislopi_ in the associated\r\nstrata suggests a reference of the stems and roots to that species.\r\nMoreover the structure of the secondary xylem of some petrified pieces\r\nof stem sent to me by Mr Leslie from Vereeniging agrees closely with\r\nthat of a European Cordaitean stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 470. _Cordaites (Noeggerathiopsis) Hislopi_. From\r\nMexico. (After Wieland; ⅚ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471. _Cordaites (Noeggerathiopsis) Hislopi_. From\r\nVereeniging. (A, _ca_, ⅕ nat. size; B, _ca_, ⅙ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 472. _Cordaites (Noeggerathiopsis) Hislopi_. From\r\nIndia. (Calcutta Museum; ⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _Cordaites (Noeggerathiopsis) Hislopi_ vary considerably\r\nin size, in some cases reaching a length of 80 cm. (fig. 471); the\r\nlamina tapers gradually from a short distance behind the obtuse apex\r\nto a relatively narrow base: in venation and form the leaves are\r\nvery similar to those of _C. principalis_ and other European and\r\nNorth American species. The specimen from India represented in fig.\r\n472 shows several spathulate leaves attached in a close spiral to\r\na branch. As White[618] and Zalessky have shown, the stronger ribs\r\nare separated by less prominent striations indicating the presence\r\nof two sizes of hypodermal strands. The obvious resemblance between\r\n_Noeggerathiopsis Hislopi_ and species of _Cordaites_ has long been\r\nrecognised and many authors have included Feistmantel’s genus in the\r\nCordaitales[619]. Prof. Zeiller[620] preferred to retain the name\r\n_Noeggerathiopsis_ as a precautionary measure, chiefly on the ground\r\nthat the stomata appeared to be less definitely arranged in rows\r\nand more scattered than in the European leaves of _Cordaites_, and\r\nbecause of the absence of interstitial veins. We have as yet little\r\ninformation as to the arrangement of the stomata, but in view of the\r\nirregularity in stomatal grouping in recent leaves this feature is,\r\nperhaps, of minor importance. The presence of interstitial ‘veins’ has\r\nnow been established in Indian[621] and South American[622] leaves. In\r\na paper published in 1908[623] the name _Cordaites_ was substituted for\r\n_Noeggerathiopsis_ and Zalessky’s recent work supports this step. The\r\ndescription by Zalessky of the ribbing in Goeppert’s species _Cordaites\r\naequalis_ from Siberia shows how uncertain and variable a character the\r\nvenation is even in different parts of the same leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaites Clerci_ Zalessky.\r\n\r\nThis species (fig. 469, D) was instituted for some small lanceolate\r\nor spathulate leaves from the Petschora basin (Adzva River)[624]\r\nreaching a length of 6 cm. and a breadth of 1 cm. It is separated from\r\n_Cordaites aequalis_ on the ground that the veins are more numerous, as\r\nmany as 44 in a breadth of 1 cm.\r\n\r\nA recent investigation by Miss Holden[625] of the carbonised\r\ncuticles of some Indian specimens, sent to Cambridge by the Director\r\nof the Indian Geological Survey, and a comparison of them with\r\npreparations made from European _Cordaites_ leaves, have revealed\r\ncertain distinguishing features which support Zeiller’s view that\r\nthe Gondwana-Land leaves, though similar superficially to those of\r\n_Cordaites_, are probably distinct. It is, however, impossible in many\r\ncases to obtain any information with regard to epidermal characters,\r\nand though it would seem probable that had we a fuller knowledge of\r\nthe Indian and southern hemisphere plants represented for the most\r\npart by leaf-impressions well-defined distinguishing features would\r\nbe recognised, the comprehensive name _Cordaites_ may conveniently\r\nbe retained on the ground that in the absence of well-preserved\r\ncuticles no satisfactory distinguishing features are exhibited by the\r\nimpressions of _Noeggerathiopsis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Phylladoderma.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\n_Phylladoderma Arberi_ Zalessky.\r\n\r\nZalessky[626] founded this genus on some Permian leaves from the\r\nPetschora basin (Adzva River) which closely resemble those of\r\n_Cordaites_ but are characterised by a coarser venation. The lanceolate\r\nlamina reaches a length of 18 cm. and a breadth of 4·2 cm.; the veins\r\nare 2 mm. apart and occasionally forked near the base of the leaf. The\r\nepidermal cells have straight walls and stomata are abundant on the\r\nlower surface. As Zalessky says, the systematic position of the leaves\r\nis uncertain though they are probably Cordaitean. The coarseness of the\r\nvenation is a feature of minor importance and hardly worthy of generic\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhiptozamites_ Schmalhausen.\r\n\r\nThis genus was instituted by Schmalhausen[627] for leaves from beds\r\nin the Kusnezk basin regarded by him as Jurassic. These strata are\r\nnow recognised as Permian[628] and homotaxial with those from which\r\nSchmalhausen[629] subsequently recorded the same species. The leaves,\r\nthough smaller than many of the Indian and South African specimens\r\nof _Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_) _Hislopi_, may belong to that\r\nspecies. Zeiller and others definitely assigned the Russian leaves to\r\n_Cordaites_.\r\n\r\n_Euryphyllum._ The Indian leaves for which Feistmantel[630] proposed\r\nthis name are, as several writers have pointed out, in all probability\r\nreferable to _Cordaites_.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion to be drawn from this imperfect summary of\r\nan extensive literature is that the employment of the generic names\r\n_Noeggerathiopsis_, _Rhiptozamites_, _Euryphyllum_, and others has\r\ntended to exaggerate the difference between the European and Southern\r\nbotanical provinces during the Permo-Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scale-leaves, seeds, and stems._\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of small scale-like leaves of the type represented in\r\nfig. 468, C, in association with _Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_)\r\n_Hislopi_[631] in India, Brazil, Siberia, and elsewhere may mean that\r\nthese organs are scales of large foliar buds. The occurrence of several\r\nforms of platyspermic seeds, in some cases apparently identical with\r\nEuropean forms and sometimes distinct types, in close association with\r\n_Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_) _Hislopi_ has already been mentioned.\r\nExamples of such seeds are described in Chapter +xxxv.+ under the genus\r\n_Samaropsis_.\r\n\r\nThere are very few satisfactory examples of Cordaitean branches from\r\nthe southern hemisphere. Schmalhausen[632] figures good specimens from\r\nSiberian rocks from which his _Rhiptozamites_ leaves were obtained.\r\nBranches with spirally disposed leaf-scars figured by Zeiller[633] from\r\nthe Rhaetic of Tonkin closely resemble _Cordaicladus_. Feistmantel’s\r\ndrawing of a fossil from the Karharbari series, compared by him\r\nwith a Fern rhizome[634], may be a Cordaitean branch, and the same\r\nauthor describes a stem[635] from New South Wales as _Caulopteris\r\nAdamsi_ which bears a close resemblance to a branch of _Cordaites_.\r\nSimilarly a leafy shoot described from India by Zeiller as _Araucarites\r\nOldhami_[636] may be compared with branches of the _Poa-Cordaites_ type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 473. _Cordaites_ (or _Mesoxylon_?) stem showing\r\nthe discoid pith partially enclosed by wood. (½ nat. size.) M. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Stems.+ i. _Pith-casts._\r\n\r\n=Artisia.= Sternberg.\r\n\r\nA character to which authors tend to attach excessive importance\r\nas a diagnostic feature is the almost invariable tendency of the\r\nparenchymatous pith of _Cordaites_ to break up on contraction into\r\ntransverse diaphragms, thus producing what is known as a discoid pith.\r\nIn the stem shown in fig. 473 the pith is represented by a more or\r\nless cylindrical cast characterised by fairly regular transverse ribs\r\nand narrow grooves; in the upper part of the fossil the peripheral\r\ntissue of the pith is preserved in the form of narrow plates projecting\r\nfrom the inner face of the wood. As Renault[637] pointed out, this\r\ntype of pith is the expression of certain conditions of growth and is\r\nnot a satisfactory distinguishing feature of any particular genus or\r\nfamily. The same tendency to form a discoid pith is characteristic\r\nof _Mesoxylon_, and it occurs also in some other Palaeozoic genera.\r\nCorda long ago figured a stem attributed by him to _Lomatofloyos_ with\r\na typical discoid pith, and a similar pith is recorded in a stem of\r\n_Dicranophyllum_[638]. Among recent plants _Juglans regia_ affords\r\nperhaps the most familiar instance of an identical form of pith: the\r\nsame type occurs in the white Jasmine, in _Ceropegia peltata_, and\r\nsome other flowering plants. An interesting case is that of the tree\r\nGroundsel, _Senecio praecox_ D.C.[639], of Mexico: in this plant,\r\nwhich grows in arid districts, the pith serves as a water-store and as\r\nthe water is drawn off the thick turgescent discs contract and form\r\nthin transverse diaphragms separated by wide spaces, as is also the\r\ncase on drying in some succulent _Euphorbia_ stems. It may be that in\r\n_Cordaites_ the medullary region also served as a water-reservoir and\r\nthe depth of the medullary discs would vary according to the state of\r\ntheir contents.\r\n\r\nThe earlier writers regarded the pith-casts as stems with scars of\r\namplexicaul leaves: Artis[640] described specimens from the English\r\nCoal Measures as _Sternbergia_, one of which he stated to be 6 ft\r\nlong; a few years later Sternberg[641] proposed the name _Artisia_ and\r\nthis has been generally used on the ground that _Sternbergia_ is the\r\nname of a recent flowering plant. A specimen of _Artisia transversa_\r\n(Art.) from the Coal Measures of Yorkshire is shown in fig. 466, B, and\r\nsimilar specimens varying considerably in diameter up to about 10 cm.\r\nare abundant in European and American Coal Measures. The prominence and\r\ndepth of the transverse ridges, the presence or absence of anastomoses\r\nbetween adjacent discs are, as Zeiller[642] says, of very doubtful\r\nvalue as specific characters. Dawson in 1846[643] spoke of _Artisia_ as\r\nprobably the pith of a tree, a view suggested to him by Mr Dawes. In\r\n1851 Williamson[644] published a description of some specimens in which\r\na pith-cast, _Artisia approximata_ Lind. and Hutt., was enclosed by\r\nwood showing very clearly Cordaitean characters. Further demonstration\r\nof the true nature of _Artisia_ was supplied by Grand’Eury from St\r\nÉtienne material. If the generic name _Artisia_ is applied to all\r\npith-casts showing the transverse ridges and grooves like those seen\r\nin fig. 466, B, it must be remembered that it is not safe to assume a\r\nconnexion with _Cordaites_ or _Mesoxylon_. A Liassic species described\r\nby Lignier[645] from France as _Artisia alternans_ is quoted by\r\nauthors as evidence of the persistence of _Cordaites_ into the Jurassic\r\nperiod; but in view of the fact that the discoid type of pith is not\r\nby any means confined to _Cordaites_ or even to the Cordaitales the\r\noccurrence of _Artisia_ is in itself of no great botanical significance.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that a discoid pith is not an invariable attribute\r\nof stems closely allied to the genus _Cordaites_; but if these\r\nreservations are made the use of the generic term _Artisia_ serves a\r\nuseful purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Petrified stems._\r\n\r\n=Dadoxylon.= Endlicher.\r\n\r\nPalaeobotanical literature contains numerous descriptions of Palaeozoic\r\npetrified wood occasionally enclosing an _Artisia_ pith-cast described\r\nunder such names as _Dadoxylon_, _Cordaioxylon_, _Araucarioxylon_,\r\netc., and regarded as portions of Cordaitean stems. It is, however,\r\ncertain that much of this material belonged to stems other than those\r\nof _Cordaites_. Recent research has demonstrated the insufficiency of\r\nthe secondary xylem alone, however well preserved, as a safe guide to\r\ngeneric position: stems identical in the structure of the secondary\r\nxylem differ in that of the primary portion of the stele, and it is on\r\nthe characters of the latter tissues that several genera have recently\r\nbeen founded. _Mesoxylon_ affords a striking example of the importance\r\nof the primary xylem as a distinctive feature. As Gothan[646] points\r\nout, the species of _Calamopitys_ recently made the type of a new\r\ngenus _Eristophyton_[647] would, in the absence of the primary xylem,\r\nprobably be regarded as Cordaitean. It is important to recognise the\r\nlimitations imposed by the imperfection of the material; we cannot\r\nin most cases determine whether a specimen should be referred to\r\n_Cordaites_ or _Mesoxylon_, and while it may be described as probably\r\nCordaitean in affinity there remains the possibility that some of the\r\nPalaeozoic plants with secondary wood like that of _Cordaites_, if\r\ntheir reproductive organs were known, would not be included in the\r\nCordaitales. Goeppert’s species _Araucarites Tchihatcheffi_, which\r\nRenault[648] quotes as _Cordaites_, has recently been assigned to a\r\nnew genus _Mesopitys_[649] because of certain distinctive features of\r\nthe primary xylem. Additional examples might be quoted pointing to the\r\ntendency of recent and more thorough investigation to establish the\r\nfact that the occurrence of Permo-Carboniferous wood of the Araucarian\r\ntype does not necessarily denote the existence of _Cordaites_. The\r\nquestion of nomenclature is necessarily raised in this connexion.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has been customary to assign Palaeozoic wood with\r\nAraucarian pitting to the genus _Dadoxylon_, while wood of the same\r\ngeneral type from more recent strata is by many authors referred to\r\n_Araucarioxylon_[650]. This arbitrary distinction based on a difference\r\nin age is open to serious objection. Fossil wood of the Araucarian type\r\nis widely scattered in strata ranging from Carboniferous to Jurassic\r\nperiods; it also occurs in later formations. The fact that on the one\r\nhand Araucarian plants, as recognised by cones and foliage-shoots, are\r\nespecially characteristic of Jurassic floras and occur more rarely in\r\nRhaetic and Triassic floras, and on the other hand that _Cordaites_ and\r\nits allies reached their greatest development in Permo-Carboniferous\r\ntimes, renders it probable that in the majority of cases a distinctive\r\nname based on geological age would be in accordance with botanical\r\ndifferences. But we have no satisfactory data as to the upper limits\r\nof the Cordaiteae or the lower limits of the Araucarineae: in all\r\nprobability the two families overlapped and co-existed for more than\r\none geological period. It is, moreover, the plants from formations\r\nwhere overlapping occurred that are the most critical from a botanical\r\nstandpoint. The age-distinction is therefore at best an artificial\r\none and may be seriously misleading. Potonié[651] and Gothan[652]\r\nhave emphasised the desirability of adopting the name _Dadoxylon_ for\r\nall wood of the Araucarian type irrespective of age. If a particular\r\nspecimen can be correlated definitely with _Cordaites_ or some other\r\ngenus it should be so designated, but the fragmentary nature of the\r\nrecords usually precludes this simple course. The most logical plan is\r\nto use the name _Dadoxylon_ for all woods with Araucarian characters if\r\nthere is no sufficient reason for employing a less provisional term.\r\nIf the evidence clearly points to the Araucarineae the generic name\r\n_Araucarioxylon_ should be added in parentheses after _Dadoxylon_,\r\nbut whether or not this is done, a statement as to the geological\r\nage of the fossil will in itself be some assistance in enabling the\r\nstudent to form an opinion on the balance of probability in favour\r\nof a Cordaitean or an Araucarian affinity. The course suggested\r\nby Gothan[653], namely to add _Cordaites_ after _Dadoxylon_ if an\r\n_Artisia_ pith is present, is rendered inoperative now that we know\r\nthat a discoid pith occurs in more than one genus. In this chapter we\r\nare concerned primarily with _Cordaites_ and with such stems as may\r\nfairly be regarded as Cordaitean: examples of fossil wood from later\r\nformations are dealt with in another place. A distinction between\r\n_Araucarioxylon_ and _Cordaioxylon_ stems has been based by Felix on\r\nthe nature of the pith-casts; those of the _Artisia_ type he refers to\r\n_Cordaioxylon_, while Palaeozoic stems with _Tylodendron_ pith-casts\r\nare assigned to _Araucarioxylon_[654]. This distinction can, however,\r\nonly be made in the comparatively few cases in which the pith-cast is\r\npreserved. Its validity is, moreover, open to question. A _Tylodendron_\r\n(= _Schizodendron_) cast shows on its surface the characters of the\r\ninner face of the secondary xylem, projecting spindle-shaped areas\r\nrepresenting the inner ends of medullary rays and a reticulum of\r\ngrooves formed by the more resistant and prominent inner edges of\r\nthe rows of tracheids (fig. 746). A pith-cast of a stem in which the\r\ndestruction by decay of the medullary parenchyma had not extended to\r\nthe edge of the xylem-cylinder might show transverse diaphragms. The\r\noccurrence of _Tylodendron_ casts means that decay had extended to the\r\nsurface of the wood. But in view of the occurrence of _Tylodendron_\r\ncasts in stems that are not those of _Cordaites_ a short account of the\r\ngenus is given on another page[655].\r\n\r\nThe main features of the stem of _Cordaites_ have already been\r\nenumerated. The stele agrees with that of _Araucaria_ and _Agathis_\r\nand especially with _Agathis_ in the double nature of the leaf-trace.\r\nWilliamson[656] in 1877 described pieces of wood from the English\r\nCoal Measures and the Lower Carboniferous of Scotland which he\r\nreferred to _Dadoxylon_ but without any specific name. These include\r\nthe Coalbrookdale stem in which he had previously demonstrated the\r\nconnexion between _Artisia_ and _Dadoxylon_. The structure of the\r\nxylem is like that in _D. Brandlingii_ and the specimens may belong\r\nto that species. The most interesting fact recorded by Williamson\r\nis the occurrence of double leaf-traces, a feature which led him to\r\nsuspect a remote generic affinity to _Ginkgo_. This double trace may\r\nbe an important diagnostic feature but unfortunately the majority of\r\ndescriptions of species of _Dadoxylon_ throw no light on the character\r\nof the foliar bundles.\r\n\r\nThomson and Allin[657] have recently pointed out that a double\r\nleaf-trace occurs in a stem from the Permian of Kansas described by\r\nPenhallow[658] as _Pityoxylon chasense_ and referred to that genus\r\nbecause of the supposed occurrence of resin-canals in some of the\r\nmedullary rays: the canals are apparently leaf-traces traversing broad\r\nrays in the secondary wood.\r\n\r\nThe primary xylem of _Cordaites_ is in direct continuity with\r\nthe secondary tracheids and does not form mesarch strands as in\r\n_Mesoxylon_. The pith is usually discoid. The pitting on the tracheids\r\nis a character of special importance: while it is true to say\r\nthat as a rule the number of pits on the radial walls of a single\r\ntracheid is larger than in the Araucarineae, this is not always the\r\ncase. In _Araucaria_ there are occasionally as many as five rows\r\nof alternate polygonal pits (fig. 691, A) and in some Palaeozoic\r\nDadoxylons there are only one[659] or two rows. The very broad zone\r\nof transitional elements at the inner edge of the xylem-cylinder\r\nis a characteristic feature shared by the Araucarineae[660]; the\r\nspiral protoxylem-tracheids are succeeded by scalariform elements and\r\nthese, by the gradual anastomosing of the transverse bars, pass into\r\ntracheids with multiseriate pitting. In this broad zone we probably\r\nhave a primitive feature, an epitome in a single stem of the course\r\nof development of multiseriate from scalariform pitting. In some\r\nPalaeozoic species with wood of the pycnoxylic type and agreeing\r\ngenerally with typical _Cordaites_ the bordered pits are sometimes\r\nseparate and circular, and opposite pits occasionally replace the\r\nusual alternate arrangement. Another feature on which stress has been\r\nlaid is that in _Cordaites_ the pits occupy the whole breadth of the\r\ntracheal wall; but this, though frequently the case, is by no means a\r\nconstant feature. In _Dadoxylon Newberryi_[661] the pits tend to form\r\ngroups, leaving unpitted areas, as in the genus _Coenoxylon_[662].\r\nIn the stem of _Dadoxylon materiarum_ Daws. represented in fig. 475\r\nthe pits do not always cover the whole of the tracheid-walls: this\r\nstem is also instructive as an example of the different appearance\r\npresented by pitted tracheids according to the state of preservation.\r\nIn some places an oblique pore is well shown while in others only the\r\nouter border of the pit is seen. Gothan[663] has described a specimen\r\nin which some of the pits are circular and occupy only the central\r\narea of the xylem elements: separate circular pits occur also in _D.\r\nPedroi_ Zeill.[664] (fig. 476). Similar departures from the normal\r\nare illustrated by recent species of Araucarineae. The absence of a\r\ntorus is another feature shared by _Dadoxylon_ and true Araucarian\r\nwood. Annual rings other than incomplete and spasmodically formed rows\r\nof narrower tracheids are not as a rule present, and in this respect\r\nalso _Araucaria_ affords a close analogy. Thomson[665] has figured\r\na transverse section of a root from English Coal Measures in which\r\nrings of growth are well defined; and other instances are recorded.\r\nIn an Australian species named by Arber _D. australe_[666], there are\r\nwell-marked rings of growth, and this is equally the case in some\r\nIndian wood[667] of Permo-Carboniferous age, more nearly allied to\r\n_Mesoxylon_ than to _Cordaites_, and in a _Dadoxylon_ of similar age\r\nfrom South Africa. On the other hand the statement that annual rings\r\noccur in Palaeozoic wood is often incorrect, partial rings having been\r\nconfused with regular concentric cylinders of summer elements. Dawson\r\nand Matthew[668] described rings in _D. ouangondianum_, and Goeppert\r\nand Stenzel[669], who examined the Canadian material, refer to circles\r\nlike annual rings; but Penhallow[670] states that there is no evidence\r\nof true growth-rings.\r\n\r\nThe medullary rays are uniseriate and consist of thin parenchymatous\r\ncells with unpitted walls; they vary considerably in depth, usually\r\ncomparatively shallow but in some cases 40 or 50 cells deep. In recent\r\nAraucarineae the rays are generally shallower. The absence of special\r\nreceptacles, other than occasional resiniferous tracheids, for products\r\nof secretion is a feature common to _Dadoxylon_ and the Araucarineae.\r\nThe phloem presents no features of special interest, but our knowledge\r\nof this tissue is comparatively meagre.\r\n\r\nAmong other examples of large _Dadoxylon_ stems some of which no\r\ndoubt bore Cordaitean foliage—though as a rule we have insufficient\r\ninformation as regards anatomical characters to enable a decision\r\nto be made between _Cordaites_ and _Mesoxylon_—reference should be\r\nmade to the imposing array of silicified trunks in the grounds of the\r\nChemnitz Museum[671]. These were obtained from Lower Permian strata\r\nat Hilbersdorf near Chemnitz from beds overlain by porphyry tuff and\r\nresting on quartz porphyry, the volcanic material which furnished\r\nthe siliceous solutions. Several large pieces of wood were found in\r\nassociation with stems of _Medullosa_ and _Psaronius_, leaves of\r\n_Cordaites_, _Artisia_ pith-casts, and _Cardiocarpus_ seeds with\r\nspecimens of _Walchia_, _Gomphostrobus_ and other plants. Sterzel\r\ndescribes a stem 16·5 met. long and 1·5 met. in diameter; on the main\r\ntrunk the branch-scars are scattered but on some branches there is\r\na tendency to a whorled arrangement. This and many other stems are\r\nreferred to _Araucarioxylon_ (or _Dadoxylon_) _saxonicum_, a species\r\nfirst described by Reichenbach as _Megadendron saxonicum_. In one\r\nspecimen Sterzel states that the bordered pits are generally in 1–2\r\nrows, though rarely in 3–4 rows, on the radial walls of the tracheids\r\nwhich they do not completely cover: the medullary rays reach a depth of\r\nbetween 20 and 30 cells. It is noteworthy that the stem 16·5 met. long\r\nhas a pith-cast of the _Tylodendron_ type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon_ (_Cordaites_) _Brandlingii_ (Lindley and Hutton).\r\n\r\n1831. _Pinites Brandlingii_ Lindley and Hutton, Foss.

The stem, 72 ft long and far from complete,\r\nshowed an irregular and not a whorled distribution of branch-scars. It\r\nis noteworthy that in _D. medullaris_ (Goepp.)[672], a Permian species\r\nfrom Saxony, the branch-scars, while for the most part irregularly\r\nscattered, in one case showed an approach to a whorled disposition\r\nas in recent Araucarias. Witham[673] gave a fuller account of the\r\nstructure of the stem than is included in the original description,\r\nand the species has been described by many later authors from both\r\nPermian and Carboniferous localities. The pith is discoid and the broad\r\ntransitional region at the inner edge of the wood is a characteristic\r\nfeature[674]. Thomson[675] points out that there is a tendency to a\r\nretention of the scalariform type of pitting in the region of the\r\nmedullary rays. There are 1–5 rows of pits on the radial walls of the\r\ntracheids. The rays may reach a depth of 40 cells; they are usually one\r\ncell broad. It has recently been shown that as many as six vascular\r\nstrands[676] may form one leaf-trace instead of the customary pair,\r\na feature suggesting comparison with _Metacordaites Rigolloti_ Ren.\r\nwith its five foliar bundles. Other species agree very closely with\r\n_D. Brandlingii_ and it is impossible to determine with accuracy the\r\nprecise specific limits of stems agreeing generally with this type; but\r\nfor the sake of emphasising the variation in anatomical structure it\r\nis worth while to draw attention to a few more or less divergent forms\r\nfrom different geographical areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon protopityoides_ Felix.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in this Westphalian type from Germany is the\r\noccurrence of transversely elongated pits on the tracheids[677]\r\nassociated with those of normal form closely simulating the pits in the\r\nxylem elements of _Protopitys_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon nummularium_ White.\r\n\r\nIn this Brazilian wood[678] from Permo-Carboniferous beds the medullary\r\nrays are very numerous, mostly uniseriate and 1–30 cells in depth.\r\nThe pits on the tracheids are in 1–2 rows and are often contiguous.\r\nIn another type, _D. meridionale_, described by the same author[679],\r\nthe pits are strictly uniseriate and generally contiguous. As White\r\nsays, the absence of the pith and cortex and of any evidence as to\r\nthe structure of the primary xylem renders impossible any definite\r\nexpression of opinion as to the affinity of these and many other\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon Nicoli_ Seward.\r\n\r\nDr Arber[680] in naming this species, from the Newcastle\r\n(Permo-Carboniferous) Series of New South Wales, _Dadoxylon australe_,\r\ndoes not mention Crié’s earlier account of some wood from New Caledonia\r\nunder the name _Araucarioxylon australe_[681]. The latter generic name\r\naccording to the usage adopted in this volume should be superseded by\r\n_Dadoxylon_, and this necessitates a fresh specific name for Arber’s\r\nspecimens. The name _Nicoli_ is suggested in place of _australe_, as\r\nthe sections on which Arber founded his species form part of the Nicol\r\ncollection in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe xylem shows distinct rings of growth, a feature also seen in\r\nIndian stems of approximately the same geological age and recorded\r\nby Shirley[682] in wood from Queensland which needs more careful\r\nexamination. The bordered pits, usually multiseriate and contiguous,\r\nare not infrequently in 1–2 rows and separate. The uniseriate\r\nmedullary rays are very numerous as in White’s Brazilian species _D.\r\nnummularium_, and as a rule 6–12 cells deep. Some well-preserved\r\nspecimens from Permo-Carboniferous strata in Natal and Zululand have\r\nbeen described by Warren[683] as _Dadoxylon australe_ Arb., showing\r\ninteresting anatomical features, but the material almost certainly\r\nincludes more than one specific type and would repay more detailed\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon materiarum_ Dawson.\r\n\r\nThis species was described by Dawson[684] from Carboniferous strata\r\nin Nova Scotia and afterwards referred by Penhallow[685] to the genus\r\n_Cordaites_. In the transverse section reproduced in fig. 474, A, the\r\ntracheid-walls have been reduced in thickness by partial decay, but\r\nsome of the bordered pits are clearly shown on the radial walls; the\r\npits usually form 2–4 contiguous rows (fig. 475) in some cases with an\r\noblique pore while others are represented either by the outer border of\r\nthe pit or by the pore only. The narrow medullary rays are as a rule\r\nuniseriate and may be 60 cells deep (fig. 474, B). Dawson states that\r\nsome specimens have large _Artisia_ pith-casts, a fact that formerly\r\nwould have been regarded as proof of the _Cordaites_ nature of the\r\nwood, but in the absence of evidence with regard to the nature of the\r\nprimary xylem it is impossible to say whether the stem is _Cordaites_\r\nor _Mesoxylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon_ sp.\r\n\r\nSome wood received from Mr Leslie, collected at Vereeniging, South\r\nAfrica, in Permo-Carboniferous rocks, shows well-defined rings of\r\ngrowth. The pits form either a single row, a double, alternate and\r\ncontiguous row, or rarely three series on the tracheid walls. The\r\nmedullary rays are usually uniseriate and 1–30 cells deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon Kayi_ Arber.\r\n\r\nThis species is represented by some large trunks, in some cases with\r\na diameter of 40 cm., discovered by Mr Kay in the Coal Measures of\r\nWorcestershire[686]. The pith is very small and shows no indication of\r\na discoid structure, but owing to its poor preservation no sections\r\ncould be obtained of this region. The secondary wood is characterised\r\nby the large number of uniseriate medullary rays 1–27 cells in depth;\r\nthe tracheids have usually two or sometimes three rows of alternate and\r\ncontiguous bordered pits on the radial walls. Arber regards the absence\r\nof a discoid pith as a fatal objection to a reference of the stems to\r\n_Cordaites_ and speaks of them as affording further evidence of the\r\noccurrence of Coniferae in the higher Coal Measures of the Midlands. It\r\nis, however, impossible to determine the position of the species in the\r\nabsence of any data with regard to the structure of the perimedullary\r\nregion, and without such information we are hardly justified in\r\nregarding _Dadoxylon Kayi_ as a member of the Coniferales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474. _Dadoxylon materiarum._ Transverse (A) and\r\ntangential (B) sections of the secondary xylem. (Kidston Coll. 222,\r\n224.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475. _Dadoxylon materiarum._ A–C radial\r\nlongitudinal sections of the secondary xylem. (Kidston Coll. 225.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon Pedroi_ Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis species from Upper Carboniferous or possibly Lower Permian strata\r\nin Brazil[687] has a pith 3·8 cm. in diameter composed of parenchyma\r\nwith scattered secretory sacs and characterised by the occurrence of\r\nthree equidistant bays projecting into the cylinder of wood (fig. 476,\r\nA) which extend through the length of the specimen (6 cm.): these, as\r\nZeiller suggests, may be connected with the departure of leaf-traces\r\nor branches. The xylem is entirely composed of centrifugal elements\r\nand shows a broad transitional zone (fig. 476, B) including spiral,\r\nscalariform, and reticulate tracheids, but the bordered pits are less\r\nnumerous and less crowded than in many species of _Dadoxylon_. The rays\r\nare 1–2 cells broad and reach a depth of 50 cells. The most striking\r\nfeatures are the solid and not discoid pith with its three rounded\r\nbays and secretory canals, also the smaller number and frequently\r\ncircular form of the pits on the tracheids. Zeiller considers that\r\nthe stem is that of some Cordaitean plant though probably not a true\r\n_Cordaites_. White[688] questions the advisability of adopting the\r\ngeneric name _Dadoxylon_ and suggests the possibility, though without\r\nany satisfactory evidence, that it is the stem of a _Gangamopteris_.\r\nFailing further information, there would seem to be no sufficient\r\nreason for the institution of a distinctive generic name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 476. _Dadoxylon Pedroi._ A, transverse section\r\nshowing the pith and part of the secondary wood. B, longitudinal\r\nsection of part of the secondary wood. (After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon permiense_ (Renault).\r\n\r\nThis Permian species from Autun[689] differs from typical examples of\r\nthe genus in the differentiation of the pith into a central thin-walled\r\nregion contracted into transverse diaphragms surrounded by a cylinder\r\nof stouter tissue and in the greater breadth of the medullary rays. The\r\ntracheids have 3–4 rows of pits of the usual type. Spirally disposed,\r\ndecurrent, leaf-bases occur on the surface of the stem, and the cortex\r\nincludes secretory canals and strands of hypodermal stereome. A small\r\nnumber of veins pass up the median part of the lamina which in this\r\nrespect and in its greater thickness differs from that of _Cordaites_\r\nleaves. Renault speaks of the rays as a cycadean feature, but they are\r\nonly two cells in width and shorter than in recent Cycads.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon spetsbergense_ Gothan.\r\n\r\nIn this species[690] from Spitzbergen, of doubtful age though probably\r\nPalaeozoic, there is no xylem-parenchyma and the medullary rays are\r\nfrom 2 to 5 cells deep; the bordered pits occur in 1–2 or rarely 3\r\nrows on the radial walls of the tracheids; they are alternate but not\r\nflattened and characterised by their small size (7μ high); they do not\r\ncover the whole face of the tracheids. It is pointed out that in many\r\nPalaeozoic and Mesozoic Dadoxylons the pits are larger than in recent\r\nspecies (16–17·5μ as compared with 9–12μ) while in _D. spetsbergense_\r\nthey are still smaller. The large size of the medullary-ray cells\r\nis another noteworthy feature, also the absence of annual rings, a\r\ncharacter possibly connected with conditions of growth in northern\r\nregions. It is, however, pointed out by Nathorst[691] that the fossil\r\nwas not found _in situ_ and, as he says, it may have been carried by\r\ncurrents from a more southern locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Metacordaites.= Renault.\r\n\r\n_Metacordaites Rigolloti_ Renault.\r\n\r\nRenault founded this species[692] and genus on a stem from Autun which,\r\nlike _D. Pedroi_, differs in certain respects from stems usually\r\nattributed to _Cordaites_. The pith is solid and contains secretory\r\nducts and cells; the tracheids have often a single row of pits, and\r\nmultiseriate pitting is much less common than in _Dadoxylon_. The\r\nmedullary rays are generally 1–6 cells deep. A striking feature is\r\nthe occurrence of groups of five vascular bundles penetrating the\r\nsecondary wood in V-shaped groups, each group being regarded as a\r\nmultiple leaf-trace, a type recently recognised by Thomson in _D.\r\nBrandlingii_. In one of Renault’s figures a larger scar, presumably a\r\nbranch-scar, is shown immediately above a group of foliar bundles. The\r\ngenus _Metacordaites_ is considered by its author to be intermediate\r\nbetween Conifers and the Cordaitales, but nearer to the former. This\r\nconclusion is, however, based on insufficient evidence, as nothing is\r\nknown of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Roots.+\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Williamson[693] gave an account of a petrified plant from\r\nthe Lancashire Coal Measures which he named _Dictyoxylon radicans_,\r\nbut he afterwards came to the conclusion that the specimens so named\r\nwere portions of the subterranean axis of some other plant, possibly\r\n_Asterophyllites_, and proposed a new generic term _Amyelon_[694].\r\nIn 1874 he brought forward fresh evidence in support of connecting\r\n_Amyelon radicans_ with _Asterophyllites_ or _Sphenophyllum_, genera\r\nwhich Williamson believed to be very closely related. It has since\r\nbeen recognised that _Amyelon_ is the root of _Cordaites_ or of some\r\nclosely allied member of the Cordaitales. Our knowledge of Cordaitean\r\nroots is based chiefly on the work of Williamson and Renault[695],\r\nand more recently Osborne[696] has added new facts of considerable\r\ninterest. In the larger roots the primary xylem may be diarch or\r\nthere may be as many as four or five protoxylem groups (fig. 477).\r\nThe primary tracheids are spiral or scalariform and the space, _s_,\r\nseparating them from the surrounding secondary xylem seen in fig. 477,\r\nB, was no doubt originally occupied by conjunctive parenchyma. The\r\nsecondary wood is composed of tracheids, with contiguous bordered pits\r\nidentical with those in the xylem of the stem, and narrow medullary\r\nrays. The section, 4 mm. in diameter, represented in fig. 477, A, shows\r\na tetrarch primary xylem strand enclosed by secondary wood composed of\r\nrather thin-walled elements succeeded by a zone of phloem including\r\nsome secretory sacs, and beyond this is a cylinder of periderm, _p_.\r\nIn a section of a root figured by Renault from Autun the periderm is\r\nseparated from the stele by a broad band of parenchyma which appears\r\nto be cortical, but in the British specimens the deep-seated origin\r\nof the periderm is clearly shown: Osborne states that it arises in\r\na layer immediately outside the endodermis. In one of the specimens\r\nfigured by Williamson[697] the secondary wood shows clearly marked\r\nirregular concentric lines simulating rings of growth, but there is\r\nno evidence of any regularly recurring variation in the diameter of\r\nthe xylem-elements. From the descriptions of Williamson and Osborne it\r\nis evident that the roots of _Cordaites_ were profusely branched and,\r\nas the latter author has shown, the method of branching points to the\r\nformation of coralline roots like those of recent Cycads, some Conifers\r\nand Dicotyledons. Osborne found that the cortex of small rootlets\r\nis composed of two zones, an outer parenchyma without cell-contents\r\nand an inner parenchymatous tissue characterised by the occurrence in\r\nsome of the cells of tangled masses of fungal hyphae almost always\r\nunseptate. In some cases the hyphae bear terminal vesicles similar to\r\nthose observed on fungal hyphae in the cortex of _Podocarpus_ roots.\r\nOsborne makes out a good case for regarding the fungus as symbiotically\r\nrelated to the tissues of the lateral roots, a relationship identical\r\nwith that in many existing trees, particularly _Myrica_ and _Alnus_.\r\nIt is suggested that the formation of the coralline root-tubercles is\r\na feature consistent with the view that _Cordaites_ lived in saline\r\nmarshes, a physiologically dry habitat favourable to the occurrence of\r\nmycorhiza.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 477. A, root of _Cordaites_. B, centre of the\r\nroot enlarged; _p_, periderm; _s_, space. (Kidston Coll. 1906.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478. Root (_Cordaites_?) exposed in the bed of\r\nthe Vaal river. (After Mellor and Leslie.)]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the habit of Cordaitean roots in the\r\ngeneral account of the genus (figs. 468, A, 478). The specimen shown in\r\nfig. 478 may be a root of _Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_) _Hislopi_,\r\nbut nothing is known as to its structure[698].\r\n\r\n\r\n+Reproductive Organs.+\r\n\r\n=Cordaianthus.= Grand’Eury.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet no definite knowledge of the nature of the reproductive\r\norgans of _Mesoxylon_ and _Poroxylon_, but having regard to their\r\nclose resemblance in other respects to _Cordaites_, particularly in\r\nthe case of _Mesoxylon_, the presumption is that some of the seeds and\r\nfertile shoots attributed to _Cordaites_ may belong to other members\r\nof the Cordaitales. Despite the abundance of _Cordaites_, or at least\r\nof material assigned to that genus, and the comparative frequency of\r\nfertile shoots in actual connexion with foliage-shoots, the practical\r\nidentity of _Mesoxylon_ and _Cordaites_ leaves precludes any confident\r\nuse of the latter name in a strict sense.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Brongniart[699] described a small bud-like fossil of Tertiary\r\nage as _Antholithes liliacea_, and this generic name in the form\r\n_Antholithus_ became widely used for fertile shoots or flowers from\r\ndifferent geological horizons. As knowledge became more precise other\r\nnames replaced _Antholithus_, though Renault[700] retained it for some\r\ninflorescences from Commentry which could not definitely be included\r\nin _Cordaites_. Lindley and Hutton[701] employed the genus for a\r\nspecimen, now recognised as a Cordaitean fertile shoot, from the Coal\r\nMeasures which they called _Antholithus Pitcairniae_, the specific\r\nname being chosen to indicate a possible affinity to the Bromeliaceous\r\ngenus _Pitcairnia_. A few years later Morris[702] described a similar\r\ninflorescence as _A. anomalus_. In 1872 Carruthers[703] substituted\r\nBrongniart’s term _Cardiocarpon_ for _Antholithus_ and called _A.\r\nPitcairniae Cardiocarpon Lindleyi_ and Morris’s species _C. anomalum_.\r\nThe specific name _Lindleyi_ has been widely adopted, but there would\r\nseem to be no adequate reason for disregarding the priority-rule.\r\nIt is, however, customary to use Grand’Eury’s term _Cordaianthus_\r\nfor all Cordaitean inflorescences. Goeppert[704] suggested the name\r\n_Botryoconus_ for an inflorescence similar to _C. Pitcairniae_ and for\r\nthis C. E. Weiss[705] substituted _Noeggerathianthus_ on the ground\r\nthat he considered Goeppert’s specimen to be the male inflorescence of\r\n_Noeggerathia_. Grand’Eury resuscitated _Botryoconus_[706] for some\r\nspikes from the Gard coalfield connected by him with _Dory-Cordaites_.\r\nThe nature of the seeds borne by the inflorescences has largely\r\ninfluenced authors in the choice of a generic name: Carruthers used\r\n_Cardiocarpon_ while Zeiller[707] speaks of _Samaropsis Pitcairniae_.\r\nThe genus _Cardiocarpon_ was founded by Brongniart for compressed\r\ncordiform seeds, but it was not until later that their gymnospermous\r\nnature was recognised. Further reference to the nomenclature of\r\nseeds of the _Cardiocarpon_ type will be found in Chapter +xxxv.+\r\nThe correlation by Grand’Eury and other authors of different species\r\nof inflorescences and species of _Cordaites_ is frequently based on\r\nassociation, and in the absence of more satisfactory evidence the safer\r\ncourse is to deal with Cordaitean fertile shoots in a general sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479. _Cordaianthus._ From the Middle Coal\r\nMeasures of Lancashire. (Manchester Museum; ⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Ovulate shoots._ These are represented by a considerable number\r\nof forms in both European and American localities. In rare cases the\r\ncompound shoot reaches a length of 30 cm. (fig. 479), but it is usually\r\nmuch shorter; the lateral compact buds may be more or less widely\r\nseparated: the seeds have long pedicels (fig. 480, A) or appear to\r\nbe sessile (fig. 480, B) and there may be one or several seeds on a\r\nsingle lateral shoot. The seeds are platyspermic and, as seen in fig.\r\n480, A, in some inflorescences they show very clearly the _Samaropsis_\r\nfeatures. It would, however, be unsafe to assume that all _Samaropsis_\r\nseeds were borne on Cordaitean plants. Among other types of seed\r\nreferred by authors to _Cordaites_ are _Cardiocarpus_, _Cordaicarpus_,\r\n_Sarcotaxus_, _Taxospermum_, _Diplotesta_, and _Leptocaryon_. But in\r\nmost cases there is no evidence of actual connexion between seeds and\r\nvegetative organs, and while it is possible to state with confidence\r\nthat many of the seeds represented by impressions described as species\r\nof _Samaropsis_ and _Cordaicarpus_ are undoubtedly Cordaitean, it is\r\ncertain that not all seeds referable to these genera were borne by\r\nCordaitalean plants. Cordaitean seeds are characterised by certain\r\nmorphological features recalling those found in recent Cycads and in\r\nthe seeds of _Ginkgo_ as illustrated by species of _Cardiocarpus_ and\r\nsome allied types. As most of the Palaeozoic seeds known in a petrified\r\nstate cannot be assigned to their parent-plants they are dealt with in\r\na separate chapter[708].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaianthus Pitcairniae_ (Lindley and Hutton).\r\n\r\nThis type of inflorescence[709] is considered by Kidston to belong to\r\nthe tree which bore leaves known as _Cordaites principalis_, but if\r\nthis is the case it is probable that the stem possessed the anatomical\r\ncharacters of _Mesoxylon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480. A, _Cordaianthus Pitcairniae_ with\r\n_Samaropsis_ seeds. B, _Cordaianthus Volkmanni_. B′, portion of B\r\nenlarged. (A, B, nat. size; Kidston Coll. 2374, 1174.)]\r\n\r\nThe portion of an inflorescence shown in fig. 480, A, from the Middle\r\nCoal Measures of Yorkshire, illustrates the occurrence of the bud-like\r\nfertile shoots and the stalked _Samaropsis_ seeds. A species described\r\nby Renault[710] from Commentry as _Cordaianthus acicularis_ may be\r\nidentical with the British species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordaianthus Volkmanni_ Ettingshausen.\r\n\r\nThe example of this species[711] seen in fig. 480, B, shows the\r\nrelatively small size of the lateral buds, presumably unexpanded,\r\ncompared with the large subtending bracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Petrified specimens of Cordaianthus.=\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the structure of _Cordaianthus_ is based on\r\nthe researches of Renault[712], supplemented by those of Prof.\r\nBertrand[713] to whose kindness I owe the photographs reproduced in\r\nfig. 481. The inflorescences described by Renault are referred by\r\nhim to different species, but in the following brief account these\r\nare treated from a generic standpoint. The tangential section of\r\n_Cordaianthus Williamsoni_ Ren. shown in fig. 481, D, was originally\r\nfigured by Renault and more recently by Bertrand; it shows the spirally\r\ndisposed leaf-traces in the lower part of a stout axis, and at the\r\nsides some vascular bundles are seen passing up into the bracts. A very\r\nsmall proportion of the bracts subtend ovules; two are seen at _a_ and\r\n_b_, and at _c_ is the tangentially cut micropylar canal of a third\r\nborne near the apex and covered by the terminal cluster of bracts. The\r\novule _a_, separated by a narrow space from its short stalk, consists\r\nof a thick single integument—not two as stated by Renault—extended\r\nat the apex as a micropylar canal: the apical extension is more\r\ncompletely shown in the tangentially cut ovule _b_. The central body is\r\nmuch contracted and the two spaces, _s_, at the base are regarded by\r\nBertrand as cavities in the integument separated from one another by a\r\ncentral strand of conducting tissue which gives off two bundles to the\r\nintegument, one at each end of the long axis of the seed (fig. 481, A,\r\n_v_). The dark patch, _n_ (fig. D), is the upper and broader end of\r\nthe shrunken nucellus the apex of which extends upwards as a slender\r\nbeak, and this originally no doubt fitted into the micropyle. Fig. 481,\r\nC, shows a female inflorescence in transverse section; the stele\r\nconsists of a ring of bundles separated by broad medullary rays and\r\nenclosing a comparatively large pith: the leaf-traces are seen in the\r\ncortex and one is cut through as it bends out into a bract which is not\r\nyet free from the axis. Two ovules, seen in section at _a_ and _b_, are\r\nrepresented by the bilaterally symmetrical and compressed integument\r\nenclosing small pieces of nucellar tissue. Fig. 481, E, is a transverse\r\nsection of an inflorescence at a higher level and above the apex of the\r\naxis: there are four large ovules and one aborted ovule, _a_. Bertrand\r\ndescribes two vascular bundles in the integument of the ovule _a_, one\r\nat each end of the long axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481.

From the centre of its\r\nbroad upper surface the nucellus projects upwards as a beak, _b_,\r\nand this originally engaged with the micropylar canal formed by the\r\nintegument: the lighter patch below the beak is the pollen-chamber\r\n(fig. 481, B, _pc_) containing two microspores, and two more, _p_, are\r\nseen above the nucellar beak. In another species described by Renault,\r\n_C. Lacattii_, the nucellus fills the space bounded by the integument.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Staminate inflorescences._ The male inflorescence, though\r\nsmaller, is similar in habit to the ovulate shoot: the secondary branch\r\nconsists of a short axis bearing crowded, spirally disposed, bracts,\r\nand the actual flowers are represented by single stamens or groups of\r\n2–3 highly specialised microsporophylls. Each microsporophyll consists\r\nof a long filament with a central vascular strand bearing at its apex\r\n3–4 long microsporangia (fig. 481, F, _m_) which open longitudinally\r\nas seen in fig. 482, A. The microsporangia are 2·5–3 mm. long covered\r\nby dark palisade cells and thin-walled parenchyma, shown as indistinct\r\npatches in the photograph. Some of the elliptical and comparatively\r\nlarge microspores are seen in fig. 482, B; the exine is finely punctate\r\nand inside are the remains of a few thin cells in which presumably\r\nspermatozoids were developed. The microspores shown in fig. 482,\r\nB, have a maximum length of 0·1 mm.: Renault describes some as 0·9\r\nmm. long while others are much smaller. Fig. 481, F, is a transverse\r\nsection of a staminate inflorescence showing near the centre five\r\ngroups of microsporangia, each sporangium having the form of a curved\r\nincomplete dark band indicating that dehiscence has occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482. _Cordaianthus._ Microsporangia, A, and\r\nMicrospores, B. (University College Collection, London.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mesoxylon.= Scott and Maslen.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted for stems obtained by Messrs Lomax\r\nfrom the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire[714] previously referred by\r\nScott[715] to _Cordaites_ and _Poroxylon_. Further investigation showed\r\nthat while agreeing closely with those genera they possessed certain\r\ndistinctive features demanding recognition. The name chosen suggests\r\nthe intermediate nature of the stems. The more striking features may\r\nbe summarised as follows: In the largest specimens so far described\r\nthe stem, including leaf-bases, reaches a diameter of 5 or 6 cm.; the\r\nlarge pith consists in the central region of diaphragms of parenchyma\r\nseparated by horizontal spaces produced by splitting and shrinkage\r\nconsequent on the failure of the tissue to keep pace with the general\r\ngrowth of the stem. The secondary xylem is of the Araucarian type and\r\nhas narrow medullary rays varying in depth from 1 to 25 cells. The\r\nleaf-traces are represented by twin-bundles which fuse in the downward\r\ndirection, the level at which fusion occurs being regarded as a\r\nspecific character. The presence of centripetal xylem is an essential\r\nfeature of the traces: the occurrence of single or double traces\r\nconsisting of centripetal elements and, externally, a large amount\r\nof centrifugal xylem is an important feature in which _Mesoxylon_\r\ndiffers from _Cordaites_. The double leaf-traces divide after\r\nemerging from the secondary wood and each strap-like leaf receives\r\nseveral collateral bundles (fig. 483, C). An axillary bud may occur\r\nat the base of each leaf (fig. 483, A, _b_). The phloem, including\r\nsieve-tubes and secretory sacs, is succeeded by a broad pericycle,\r\nand the comparatively narrow cortex is traversed by successive bands\r\nof periderm. In the outer region of the cortex the presence of radial\r\nbands of fibres is a characteristic feature. The reproductive organs\r\nare unknown. The anatomical features are well illustrated by _M.\r\nSutcliffii_ first described by Scott, who provisionally placed it in\r\n_Poroxylon_, and afterwards more fully investigated by Maslen[716].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mesoxylon Sutcliffii_ Scott.\r\n\r\nThe average diameter of the stem is 3 cm.: the section reproduced in\r\nfig. 483, A, has a maximum breadth of 3·5 cm.; the leaf-bases cut at\r\ndifferent levels give an irregular contour to the surface like that of\r\na _Lepidodendron_. An axillary bud, either reproductive or vegetative,\r\nis seen at _b_ consisting of a short axis bearing crowded bud-scales.\r\nThe leaves are crowded and according to Maslen have a phyllotaxis of\r\n⁸⁄₂₁: the lamina is linear like that of _Cordaites_ with 16 collateral\r\nbundles in the petiole. The presence of a meristematic band at the\r\nbase of the lamina affords evidence of a deciduous habit. The large\r\nsize of the pith is a striking feature with its central tissues in\r\nthe form of transverse diaphragms and a narrower peripheral zone\r\nof solid parenchyma (fig. 483, A, _a_). The secondary wood of the\r\nstele is composed of tracheids with 2–3 contiguous alternate rows of\r\nbordered pits on the radial walls, but none on the tangential walls.\r\nIn the stem shown in fig. 483, A, the secondary wood is preserved\r\nonly in patches. Numerous blunt teeth varying in prominence project\r\ninto the pith; these consist chiefly of serially disposed centrifugal\r\ntracheids distinguished by their spiral and scalariform structure and\r\nby the medullary rays which are broader than those in the more external\r\nxylem. Further reference is made to these perimedullary strands in the\r\ndescription of the leaf-traces. The medullary rays are uniseriate and\r\nusually 1–6 cells in depth: beyond the secondary wood is a cambium\r\nand a cylinder of secondary phloem (fig. 483, D, _ph_²) consisting of\r\ntubular elements, presumably sieve-tubes, and elongated secretory sacs.\r\nThe pericycle is composed of several rows of rather large and short\r\ncells and has an ill-defined outer boundary. A succession of arcs of\r\nperiderm-like tissue and phellogen, which may invade the pericycle\r\nand phloem, forms a prominent feature in the cortex; radially placed\r\nbands of fibres similar to those in _Lyginopteris_ and other genera\r\noccur in the outer cortex. At the edge of the pith the more prominent\r\nprojections of xylem are arranged in pairs (fig. 483, B) and as each\r\npair travels downwards the component strands gradually fuse[717]. Each\r\nbundle of a double trace consists internally of an arc of centripetal\r\nxylem, the elements of which are arranged in rows (fig. 483, B, _cp_),\r\nwith a single protoxylem group in the middle of the inner face, _px_.\r\nIt is not clear whether any primary centrifugal tracheids are present,\r\nbut there are indications that such are occasionally represented.\r\nIn most cases the primary xylem of the leaf-traces is exarch, but\r\nthe existence of mesarch bundles is not improbable. The bulk of each\r\nfoliar bundle is formed of a fan-shaped mass of secondary centrifugal\r\nxylem (fig. 483, B, _cf_) and an island of parenchyma occurs next\r\nthe protoxylem. There is no clearly defined boundary between the\r\nouter or centrifugal xylem of the leaf-traces and the tracheids of\r\nthe stem-wood; the latter may consist exclusively of tracheids with\r\nbordered pits or the inner rows of the xylem-cylinder may be of the\r\nscalariform or spiral type. Differences shown in transverse sections\r\nof the inner portion of the xylem are due to the circumstance that in\r\ncertain parts of the inner face of the secondary wood leaf-traces are\r\nunrepresented, while in other places the dwindled remains of the outer,\r\ncentrifugal, portions of a trace are still recognisable. As each double\r\nleaf-trace passes down the pith the bundles fuse and the single strand\r\nretains for a time some centripetal xylem; this gradually disappears\r\nand at a lower level the centripetal xylem also dies out. The space\r\nenclosing the obtuse apices of the bundles shown in fig. 483, B, was\r\noriginally occupied by thin-walled tissue which accompanied the trace\r\nin its outward course. In _Mesoxylon Sutcliffii_ the leaf-strands pass\r\nalmost horizontally through the secondary wood, bend outwards in the\r\nphloem and follow a steeply ascending course to the leaves. In fig.\r\n483, B, a double leaf-trace is seen at the inner edge of the secondary\r\nwood with the centrifugal xylem, _cf_, continuous with that of the\r\nstele: fig. 483, D, _lt_, shows a leaf-trace in the pericycle where one\r\nof the bundles has divided and the other is tangentially extended and\r\npartially divided. The branching is carried further in the cortex, as\r\nseen in fig. 483, C, where the trace is represented by a curved row of\r\nsix bundles, _lt_, and at a higher level further subdivision may occur.\r\nThe leaf-bundles are collateral and in the leaf retain both centripetal\r\nand centrifugal tracheids. In the section shown in fig. 483, C, the\r\noval stele of an axillary shoot is seen at _s_ subtended by the row of\r\ncollateral bundles: the stele has a fairly large pith surrounded by a\r\nzone of secondary xylem with broad medullary rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483. _Mesoxylon Sutcliffii_.

Lomaxi_\r\nand _M. poroxyloides_. _M. Lomaxi_ Scott and Maslen[718] generally\r\nresembles _M. Sutcliffii_ but shows the following distinctive features:\r\nthe leaves are more scattered and less crowded; the twin-bundles of the\r\nleaf-traces fuse immediately on entering the pith, thus appearing for\r\nthe most part as single and not double strands in the perimedullary\r\nzone; the centripetal xylem is well developed, the medullary rays are\r\ndeeper and the outer cortex has shorter bands of mechanical tissue.\r\n\r\nIn _Mesoxylon poroxyloides_ Scott and Maslen[719], the twin-bundles\r\nof the traces unite soon after reaching the pith as in _M. Lomaxi_,\r\nthe secondary tracheids have only two rows, or sometimes a single row,\r\nof bordered pits and the tracheids are rather smaller than in _M.\r\nLomaxi_ (20–40μ as compared with 30–60μ) and the medullary rays are\r\nshallower. There is a particularly broad zone of spiral and reticulate\r\ntransitional tracheids at the inner edge of the wood as in _Cordaites_\r\nand in _Dadoxylon Pedroi_ (fig. 476). The leaves of this species are\r\nbelieved to be represented by the type described by Dr Benson as\r\n_Cordaites Felicis_ (fig. 465)[720], but, as already suggested, it is\r\nvery probable that many or possibly nearly all the leaves from British\r\nCoal Measures described as _Cordaites_ may belong to _Mesoxylon_.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the genus _Mesoxylon_ is its close resemblance\r\nin certain characters to _Cordaites_ and _Poroxylon_: the presence\r\nof strands of centripetal xylem in the perimedullary region is an\r\nimportant feature in which _Mesoxylon_ differs from stems assigned\r\n(under the generic name _Dadoxylon_) to _Cordaites_. _Mesoxylon_\r\ndiffers from _Poroxylon_ in having a discoid pith like that of\r\n_Cordaites_, but a more important difference is the absence in the\r\nleaf-trace xylem of _Mesoxylon_ of bordered pits of the Araucarian\r\ntype, whereas in _Poroxylon_ Araucarian pits occur in both the\r\ncentripetal and centrifugal tracheids. In _Poroxylon_ the secondary\r\nxylem is manoxylic; in _Mesoxylon_, as in _Cordaites_, it is pycnoxylic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The range of Cordaites and a consideration of other imperfectly known\r\n    genera.=\r\n\r\nAn increased precision in knowledge derived from anatomical\r\ninvestigation often tends to demonstrate the untrustworthiness\r\nof criteria based on external features previously employed with\r\nconfidence. This inevitable though, from the point of view of the\r\nsystematist, inconvenient result of intensive study is well illustrated\r\nby the recent discovery of the stems named by Scott and Maslen\r\n_Mesoxylon_[721]. A separation of _Cordaites_ from _Mesoxylon_, which\r\nno doubt extended far beyond the British area, is possible only\r\nif well-preserved petrified material is available. The leaves of\r\n_Mesoxylon_, so far as our imperfect knowledge of them enables us to\r\nexpress an opinion, are constructed on a plan almost identical with\r\nthose of _Cordaites_ and, as already stated, it is almost certain\r\nthat many of the impressions referred to _Cordaites_ were borne on\r\n_Mesoxylon_ stems. An additional source of confusion is supplied by\r\nthe _Cordaites_-like leaves of _Poroxylon_. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat even within the limits of the Carboniferous and Permian formations\r\nthe recognition of true _Cordaites_ leaves must often be attended with\r\nconsiderable risk of error. Apart from the possible confusion between\r\nthe foliage of _Cordaites_ and _Mesoxylon_ there are other difficulties\r\nas regards detached leaves which depart more or less widely from\r\nthe typical Cordaitean form. Leaves such as _C. circularis_ (fig.\r\n468, B) and _C. grandifolius_ emphasise the lack of any thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory dividing line separating single pinnules of _Cardiopteris_\r\nor _Cyclopteris_ on the one hand and leaves of _Psygmophyllum_\r\non the other from _Cordaites_. The petrified buds described as\r\n_Dolerophyllum_[722] have been quoted by several authors as examples of\r\nunexpanded shoots of _Cordaites_ though anatomical evidence warrants a\r\ngeneric separation. In the case of species founded on leaves described\r\nin this chapter as _Cordaites_ it should be remembered that further\r\nresearch may necessitate an alteration in nomenclature.\r\n\r\nAmong the species included in _Cordaites_ is _Noeggerathiopsis\r\nHislopi_[723] (figs. 470–472), a type widely spread in India and in\r\nother parts of Gondwana-Land: if the change of generic name is accepted\r\nit involves the extension of the geographical range of _Cordaites_ from\r\nNorthern Europe and North America to the southern botanical province.\r\nWe have as yet no proof of the existence of _Cordaites_ in the Arctic\r\nregions. The range in time of _Cordaites_ or of the Cordaitales has\r\ngenerally been stated to be from the Upper Devonian to the Permian.\r\nIt is, however, by no means certain that the genus flourished before\r\nthe Carboniferous period, though it is clear that closely allied\r\ntypes must have lived in pre-Carboniferous floras. The strata in New\r\nBrunswick from which Dawson recorded his supposed Devonian _Cordaites_\r\nhave been shown to be Upper Carboniferous in age[724]. As regards the\r\nlength of time during which the Cordaitales existed we have no decisive\r\nevidence. In recent years the tendency has been to extend their range\r\ninto the Mesozoic era, and there are several pieces of evidence in\r\nfavour of this. There is no doubt that considerations of age based on\r\nthe arbitrary divisions of the geological scale sometimes insinuate\r\nthemselves too thoroughly into questions connected with the duration\r\nof plant-types whether represented by families or genera. We have been\r\naccustomed to regard _Cordaites_ as a genus confined to the Palaeozoic\r\nperiod, a type which with many others carried on the tradition of\r\nUpper Carboniferous forests to the Permian floras and then made way\r\nfor the precursors of Mesozoic types. There is, however, no valid\r\nreason for supposing that _Cordaites_ and other Palaeozoic genera did\r\nnot survive as less prominent members in succeeding floras. It must be\r\nadmitted that evidence in support of Mesozoic Cordaitales is not above\r\nsuspicion, though the probability is that _Cordaites_ or some allied\r\ngenera still flourished in the earlier stages of the Mesozoic era.\r\nThe data on which this opinion is based cannot be fully discussed in\r\na general treatise, but a few of the facts may be briefly considered.\r\nZeiller[725] and other authors have expressed the view that the\r\nCordaitales were not exclusively Palaeozoic. In addition to _Cordaites_\r\n(_Noeggerathiopsis_) _Hislopi_ recorded from Rhaetic floras, other\r\npossible representatives of the group are illustrated by specimens\r\nincluded in such genera as _Yuccites_, _Bambusium_ and _Krammera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pelourdea= gen. nov.\r\n\r\nThe name _Yuccites_[726] was given to some detached, broad, linear\r\nleaves from the Bunter sandstone of the Vosges which were compared with\r\nthe foliage of _Yucca_ and classed among Monocotyledons. The authors\r\nof the genus also described a cylindrical cast as a _Yuccites_ stem,\r\nincluding both stem and leaves in _Yuccites vogesiacus_. The supposed\r\nstem, as Fliche[727] has shown, is a pith-cast and is appropriately\r\nnamed by him _Endolepis vogesiacus_. The Vosges leaves are assigned\r\nby this author to the genus _Cordaites_, a change of name which may\r\neventually be justified though as yet based on insufficient evidence.\r\nThere are objections to the institution of a new name in place of\r\n_Yuccites_, but it is undesirable to retain a designation suggesting\r\nfalse ideas with regard to affinity. A new name _Pelourdea_ (after\r\nM. Pelourde of Paris, whose recent death deprives Palaeobotany of an\r\nable and promising investigator) is therefore proposed for leaves of\r\nthe _Yuccites_ type which in form, venation, and spiral phyllotaxis\r\nagree with those of _Cordaites_ but cannot confidently be assigned to\r\nthat genus or even to the Cordaitales. For linear leaves, especially\r\nfrom Jurassic strata, resembling those of _Phoenicopsis_ the name\r\n_Desmiophyllum_[728] is employed: these are very similar to those of\r\n_Pelourdea_; they are characterised by their fairly uniform breadth and\r\nafford no indication of their arrangement on the supporting axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea vogesiaca_ (Schimper and Mougeot).\r\n\r\nThe linear-lanceolate leaves described by Schimper and Mougeot as\r\n_Yuccites vogesiacus_ and transferred by Fliche to _Cordaites_ are\r\nprobably specifically identical with specimens described by Mr\r\nWills[729] from Lower Keuper rocks in Worcestershire. The English\r\nleaves were described by Arber[730] as _Zamites grandis_,—the name\r\n_Zamites vogesiacus_ having been previously used by Schimper and\r\nMougeot,—on the ground that the supposed leaves were probably pinnae\r\nof a cycadean frond, a view in agreement with an opinion previously\r\nexpressed with regard to similar leaves from Stonesfield[731]. A later\r\ndiscovery by Wills of specimens, on which the drawing reproduced in\r\nfig. 484 is based, of the same type of leaf showing the foliar nature\r\nof the fossils necessitated the abandonment of the pinna-hypothesis,\r\nand the original name _Yuccites vogesiacus_ was resuscitated[732]. The\r\nleaves reach a length of 50 cm. and a maximum breadth of 6·5 cm.; the\r\nlamina is entire, lanceolate or linear-lanceolate, the apex acuminate,\r\nand the lower part rather abruptly contracted and attached by a broad\r\ncrescentic base; veins numerous, parallel, and occasionally forked.\r\nFliche records the occurrence of a small _Artisia_-like pith-cast and\r\npieces of stem with leaf-scars (4 × 3 mm.) in association with leaves\r\nof _Pelourdea vogesiaca_ in Triassic strata in Lorraine. An imperfectly\r\npreserved specimen described by Fliche as _Cordaianthus Minieri_[733]\r\nresembles an inflorescence of _Cordaites_. It consists of an axis 15\r\ncm. long, the lower part forming a peduncle, and on the upper portion\r\nare linear bracts subtending oblong bodies which may be lateral fertile\r\nshoots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484. _Pelourdea vogesiaca_. Reconstruction of a\r\nfoliage-shoot. (After Wills.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea hadroclada_ (Halle).\r\n\r\nDr Halle[734] recently published an account of some imperfect\r\nleaves and stem-fragments from the Rhaetic of Scania which he named\r\n_Phyllotenia_ (_?_) _hadroclada_, the generic name provisionally\r\nadopted having been proposed by Salfeld[735] for some rather obscure\r\nremains from the Corallian of Germany. It appears to have escaped\r\nthe notice of both authors that Saporta[736] in 1894 had adopted the\r\ndesignation _Phyllotenia_ for some examples of broad parallel-veined\r\nleaves from Lower Cretaceous rocks in Portugal very similar to\r\nVelenovský’s _Krammera mirabilis_[737]. Some other generic name must\r\ntherefore be used. For the Rhaetic species the name _Pelourdea_ would\r\nseem appropriate. The type-specimen consists of an axis 10–12 mm. in\r\ndiameter with spirally disposed transversely elongated leaf-scars\r\nbearing sessile linear leaves similar to _Poa-Cordaites_; none of\r\nthem are complete, the largest is 6 cm. long and 5–7 mm. broad with\r\n8–12 parallel veins. An examination of the original specimens in the\r\nStockholm Museum satisfied me that Dr Halle is justified in the opinion\r\nthat they may be fragments of some Cordaitalean plant and that he\r\nwas well advised to avoid the use of the name _Cordaites_. Salfeld’s\r\nspecies, _Phyllotenia longifolia_, may be an imperfectly preserved\r\nexample of _Phoenicopsis_[738], but the material is too incomplete to\r\nbe identified with any degree of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea Imhofi_ (Heer).\r\n\r\nThe Triassic leaves from Switzerland described by Heer[739], and more\r\nrecently by Leuthardt[740], as _Bambusium Imhofi_, were referred by\r\nFliche[741] to the genus _Cordaites_. The lamina is ensiform, 25 cm.\r\nlong with a maximum breadth of 2·4 cm. Leuthardt’s photograph of\r\naerial stems and rhizomes of this supposed Monocotyledon are far from\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea keuperiana_ (Compter).\r\n\r\nThe leaves from the Lower Keuper of Thuringia assigned by Compter[742]\r\nto _Cordaites_ without adequate evidence resemble those of _P.\r\nvogesiaca_, but there is no evidence as to their manner of attachment;\r\nthey are 30–40 cm. long and from 1·5 to 2 cm. broad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea megaphylla_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nThis species was first described by Phillips[743] from the Middle\r\nJurassic Stonesfield Slate and afterwards referred to _Zamites_[744]:\r\nthe leaves bear a striking resemblance to foliage of the type\r\n_Cordaites borassifolius_; the lamina is 30 cm. long and attains a\r\nbreadth of 3 cm., the apex is acuminate and slightly contracted towards\r\nthe broad concave base. My former comparison of these Stonesfield\r\nleaves with the long pinnae of _Ceratozamia mexicana_ seemed to be\r\nsupported by Phillips’s type-specimen of _Palaeozamia longifolia_.\r\nIt may be that the supposed pinnae in Phillips’s type are spirally\r\ndisposed leaves: if this is the case the specimen may be a fragment\r\nof a _Podozamites_; its specific identity with the larger detached\r\nspecimens, though probable, cannot be demonstrated. Some leaves figured\r\nby Zigno[745] from Jurassic rocks of Italy as _Yuccites Schimperianus_\r\nmay be identical with _P. megaphylla_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pelourdea mirabilis_ (Velenovský ex Corda +MS.+).\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Krammera_, suggested by Corda, was employed by\r\nVelenovský[746] for large _Cordaites_-like leaves from the Lower\r\nCretaceous of Bohemia, for casts of cones regarded by him as stems, and\r\nfor fruit-like bodies. The leaves, previously described as _Flabellaria\r\nchamaeropifolia_ Goepp., _Dammara albens_ Presl, etc., bear a close\r\nresemblance to the large broadly linear leaves of _Cordaites_; the\r\nlamina reaches a length of 40 cm. and between the veins occur 1–4 finer\r\nstriations. The fossils identified by Velenovský as stems bearing\r\ncrowded imbricate scales, which he regarded as the persistent bases\r\nof _Krammera_ leaves, are probably cones; they agree very closely in\r\nsize and shape, also in the form of the scales, with cones of _Agathis_\r\nand some other recent Conifers. As the designation _Krammera_ was\r\ninstituted primarily for cones and not leaves the name _Pelourdea_ is\r\nsubstituted for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Niponophyllum.= Stopes and Fujii.\r\n\r\n_Niponophyllum cordaitiforme_ Stopes and Fujii.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Niponophyllum_[747] was proposed for some petrified\r\nspecimens of leaves or possibly leaflets from Upper Cretaceous beds\r\nin Japan which, though not definitely assigned to a group or family,\r\nare considered by the authors of the genus ‘to lie [anatomically]\r\nsomewhere between _Cordaites_ and _Cycadeoidea_’ ‘with a closer\r\nsimilarity to the former than to the latter if we compare the whole\r\n_Cordaites_ leaf with our blade.’ The data on which this conclusion\r\nis based are, however, insufficient to justify a reference of\r\n_Niponophyllum_ to the Cordaitales or indeed to lend any substantial\r\nsupport to the opinion that the Japanese specimens are anatomically\r\nmore akin to _Cordaites_ than to other plants. The type-species is\r\nrepresented by two specimens of leaf-fragments about 0·4 mm. thick and\r\nfrom 6 to 9 mm. broad containing from 21 to 33 vascular bundles; the\r\nupper part of the mesophyll is composed of palisade tissue and the\r\nstomata appear to be confined to the lower epidermis. Each bundle is\r\naccompanied by an =I=-shaped girder, and small patches of sclerenchyma\r\noccur next the upper epidermis between the girders; there are no\r\nresin-canals: the vascular bundles are collateral, the xylem is said\r\nto be almost entirely centripetal and exarch, but in the absence of\r\nevidence afforded by longitudinal sections the details of structure\r\ncannot be definitely determined. A comparison is made with Cycadean\r\nleaves and with leaves of Araucarineae and Podocarpeae, also with\r\n_Cordaites_; another type with which _Niponophyllum_ may be compared is\r\n_Desmiophyllum Solmsi_[748].\r\n\r\nThe genus is interesting as an example of a petrified gymnospermous\r\ntype of leaf characterised by the absence of resin-ducts and\r\ntransfusion-tracheids, the possession of collateral, apparently\r\nexarch, bundles enclosed in a double sheath; but the data supplied\r\nare insufficient to enable us to allocate the specimens to a position\r\nwithin the class.\r\n\r\nA specimen described by Schenk[749] as _Eolirion primigenium_ from\r\nLower Cretaceous beds in the Carpathian mountains closely resembles in\r\nhabit a foliage-shoot of _Poa-Cordaites_; the leaves are narrow and\r\nlinear with obtuse apices and attached, apparently, in a close spiral.\r\nSchenk assigns the plant to the Monocotyledons, but its systematic\r\nposition must be left unsettled.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe list of Mesozoic specimens resembling _Cordaites_ leaves might\r\nbe extended. Apart from some Triassic and Rhaetic examples which may\r\nwell be Cordaitalean, there are many others which, though similar in\r\nform and venation to _Cordaites_, are in all probability more closely\r\nrelated to _Agathis_ and other genera; the species _Dammarites Bayeri_\r\nrecently described by Zeiller[750] from the Upper Cretaceous of\r\nBulgaria is a case in point. The Araucarian character of the wood of\r\n_Cordaites_ precludes any satisfactory discrimination between Mesozoic\r\nAraucarian stems and those of Cordaitalean species, at least in the\r\ncase of such material as is usually available.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Titanophyllum.= Renault.\r\n\r\n_Titanophyllum Grand’Euryi_ Renault. The remarkable leaves on which\r\nthis genus and species are founded[751] were discovered in the\r\nCommentry coalfield; they occur as detached specimens and cannot be\r\ncorrelated with any known stem. Renault suggests that the Autun stems\r\nreferred to _Colpoxylon_ may have borne the _Titanophyllum_ leaves,\r\nbut this correlation rests only on the dimensions of the stems and\r\nthe occurrence of transversely elongated scars on the surface. The\r\nlamina is thick and coriaceous, 70–75 cm. long and 20–25 cm. in\r\nbreadth; the veins are parallel but not branched; numerous longitudinal\r\nstriations on the upper surface indicate the presence of hypodermal\r\nstereome-strands; stomata are abundant on the lower surface and the\r\nmore or less rectangular cells in the neighbourhood of the stomata\r\nappear to be papillose (fig. 485, A, B). The distal region of the\r\nlamina is often torn into strips (fig. 485, A); the approximately\r\nrectangular leaf has a broad elliptical base 9–10 × 3–4 cm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485. _Titanophyllum Grand’Euryi._ A, leaves\r\n¹⁄₃₀ nat. size; B, stomata on the lower surface of the lamina. (After\r\nRenault and Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\nDr White[752] describes a specimen from the Lower Coal Measures of\r\nMissouri as ? _Titanophyllum Brittsii_ which he speaks of as the thick\r\nbase of a leaf similar to that described by Renault but, as White says,\r\nno formal diagnosis is possible without more satisfactory material.\r\nSuch evidence as is available suggests that _Titanophyllum_ is a type\r\nof Cordaitalean leaf probably closely allied to _Cordaites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n                             CORDAITALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. =PITYEAE.=\r\n\r\n=Pitys=. Witham.\r\n\r\nThis generic name in the form _Pitus_ was first used by Witham[753]\r\nfor some petrified pieces of large stems from Lower Carboniferous\r\nstrata in the south of Scotland (Berwickshire). In an earlier paper\r\nWitham[754] gives an account of the beds on the banks of the Tweed from\r\nwhich the specimens of _Pitys_ and other plants were obtained. The name\r\nwas revived by Goeppert[755] as a substitute for _Pissadendron_[756]\r\nadopted by Endlicher and Unger: Scott[757] employed the older name in\r\nthe account of his investigations, which have added greatly to our\r\nknowledge of Witham’s types. The distinguishing characters of _Pitys_\r\nare: the Araucarian pitting of the secondary xylem, the large pith, the\r\noccurrence of numerous small primary xylem strands of mesarch structure\r\nin the peripheral region of the pith, and the simple nature of the\r\nleaf-traces. Nothing is known of the extrastelar tissues, and beyond\r\nthe fact that the species were arborescent we have no information with\r\nregard to the foliar[758] or reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 486. _Pitys antiqua._ Central region of stem,\r\nshowing primary xylem strands as black dots. (Kidston Collection, 598\r\nA.)]\r\n\r\n_Pitys antiqua_ Witham.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Scott[759] published a preliminary description of some sections\r\nin the possession of Dr Kidston from Lennel Braes (Berwickshire:\r\nCalciferous series) under the name _Araucarioxylon antiquum_, but\r\nin the more complete account the name _Pitys_[760] is adopted. The\r\nfollowing description is based on Scott’s paper and on the examination\r\nof the sections. Fig. 486 represents a diagrammatic sketch of a section\r\n(2·7 × 2·7 cm.) of the central region of a stem which had lost most\r\nof its secondary wood. In some cases the pith reaches a diameter of\r\n3 cm.; it consists of large parenchymatous cells broader than deep,\r\nseveral of which contain a black substance and are probably secretory\r\nelements: the intercellular spaces are fairly large. Horizontally\r\nextended gaps, due to shrinkage and collapse, occur in the pith and\r\ngive to it an appearance not unlike that of _Cordaites_. Numerous small\r\nelliptical strands of primary xylem, 0·15–0·3 mm. in diameter, are\r\nscattered in the peripheral region (fig. 486) at varying distances from\r\nthe inner edge of the secondary wood and occasionally, when about to\r\nbend outwards as a leaf-trace, a primary xylem-strand abuts directly\r\non the secondary xylem. The protoxylem occupies a more or less central\r\nposition in each mesarch strand (fig. 487, B, _px_): the centrifugal\r\ntracheids have the Araucarian pitting while the centripetal elements\r\nare spiral. A few parenchymatous cells are associated with the more\r\ncentral tracheids. A leaf-trace about to bend outwards into the zone of\r\nsecondary wood is double, but at a slightly higher level in its course\r\nit assumes the form of a single strand. The foliar bundles are thus\r\nsingle and not true double traces. Scott recognised, at the extreme\r\nedge of the pith, an association with outgoing leaf-traces of a single\r\nreparatory strand deeper in the medullary tissue. In this species there\r\nis no evidence that an outgoing trace is accompanied by an arc of\r\nsecondary xylem, but that such was the case is rendered highly probable\r\nby the discovery of an arc of wood added by the cambium to a leaf-trace\r\nin _Pitys Withami_[761]. The radial disposition of the pith-cells, many\r\nof which appear to be secretory, around each primary xylem-strand (fig.\r\n487, B) is a characteristic feature. A difficult problem, namely the\r\nrelation of primary xylem and phloem, is raised by the fact that the\r\nprimary strands are composed exclusively of xylem and are in most cases\r\nseparated from the secondary wood by several parenchymatous cells.\r\nScott favours the view that the primary phloem was originally at some\r\ndistance from the primary xylem, the cambium being formed nearer to the\r\nphloem, an arrangement foreign to recent Gymnosperms. It is perhaps\r\nconceivable that the primary conducting strands included no true phloem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 487. _Pitys antiqua._ A, radial section of\r\nsecondary xylem; B, transverse section showing the inner edge of the\r\nsecondary wood and two primary-xylem strands with protoxylem, _px_.\r\n(Kidston Coll.)]\r\n\r\nThe secondary xylem consists of tracheids with 4–5 alternate rows of\r\nhexagonal pits on the radial walls (fig. 487, A) and not infrequently\r\non the tangential faces. Near the ends of the tracheids the pits are\r\noccasionally more scattered and separate and may be reduced to a single\r\nrow[762], but on the whole the pitting is essentially Araucarian. The\r\nmedullary rays are generally 4 cells in breadth, but may be 7 cells\r\nbroad. In depth the rays extend to 70 cells. As seen in fig. 487, B,\r\nthe inner ends of the rays are especially broad owing to the tangential\r\ndilatation of the cells. The innermost secondary tracheids are\r\ncharacterised by pitting intermediate between spiral and reticulate.\r\nThere are no regular rings of growth in the wood.\r\n\r\n_Pitys primaeva_ Witham. This species[763], also founded on material\r\nfrom the Calciferous sandstone of Berwickshire, differs from _P.\r\nantiqua_ in the broader and shorter form and greater breadth of the\r\nmedullary rays (fig. 488, A, B), also in the larger tracheids and\r\nin the less crowded arrangement of the bordered pits in which the\r\ncircular form sometimes replaces the hexagonal type. The structure\r\nof the pith is not known, but Scott was able to recognise in the\r\npartially preserved pith of a branch indications of primary-xylem\r\ngroups and other features pointing to a close resemblance to _P.\r\nantiqua_[764]. A piece of stem originally described by Williamson[765]\r\nas _Lyginodendron_ (?) _anomalum_ from the Lower Carboniferous volcanic\r\nash of the Isle of Arran would appear to be closely related to, if\r\nnot specifically identical with, _P. primaeva_ and, as Scott says, it\r\nshould at least be included in the same genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 488. _Pitys primaeva._ A, transverse section of\r\nthe secondary xylem; B, tangential section of the secondary xylem.\r\n(From sections of the type-specimen in the Edinburgh University\r\nBotanical Department.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pitys Withami_ (Lindley and Hutton).

Vol. +xl.+ p. 354,\r\n      Pl. +ii.+ fig. 10: Pl. +vi.+ fig. 21.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on some sections cut from an incomplete stem\r\n36 feet long obtained in 1826 from the Calciferous sandstone of the\r\nCraigleith quarry near Edinburgh. The specimen named by Lindley and\r\nHutton _Pinites medullaris_ is no doubt specifically identical with\r\nthe larger stem. In the same year (1831) Witham[766] published an\r\naccount of a still larger stem from the same locality, 47 ft long and\r\n5 ft in diameter in the lower part, and in his book the name _Pinites\r\nWithami_ is adopted. A large specimen of this tree is erected in the\r\ngrounds of the Natural History Museum, London, and other specimens\r\nare preserved in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden. Goeppert in 1850\r\nreferred the species to _Dadoxylon_ and later to _Pitys_[767], while\r\nBrongniart[768] assigned it to his genus _Palaeoxylon_. Scott[769], who\r\nexamined Witham’s sections placed it in _Pitys_. The pitting of the\r\nsecondary tracheids is often multiseriate, but the medullary rays are\r\nnarrower than in _Pitys antiqua_ and _P. primaeva_, rarely exceeding\r\n4 cells in breadth, though still of the manoxylic type. Primary-xylem\r\nstrands occur in the peripheral region of the pith agreeing closely\r\nwith those of _P. antiqua_. There are no regular and continuous annual\r\nrings though as Witham stated there are concentric markings on the wood\r\nwhich superficially resemble true rings. The leaf-traces are single\r\nand in their passage through the cylinder of wood an arc of secondary\r\ntracheids is added to the primary elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Archaeopitys.= Scott and Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n_Archaeopitys Eastmanii_ Scott and Jeffrey. The genus\r\n_Archaeopitys_[770] has recently been instituted for a specimen of a\r\nstem from the Lower Carboniferous rocks of Kentucky which differs from\r\n_Pitys antiqua_, the type with which it is most closely allied, in the\r\nposition and behaviour of the primary vascular strands in the pith. The\r\ntype-specimen is a piece of stem 2·7 cm. in diameter including a solid\r\nparenchymatous pith 5·5 mm. broad and a cylinder of secondary wood. The\r\nwood is similar to that of _Cordaites_; the tracheids have 2–3 rows of\r\npits but for the most part the details of structure are not preserved;\r\nthe medullary rays are both uniseriate and multiseriate and not very\r\ndeep; the structure is more Cordaitean than Cycadean. A characteristic\r\nfeature is the occurrence of about 30 vascular bundles in the medullary\r\nregion: these mesarch strands, with the protoxylem near the centre,\r\nare scattered through the pith and several lie on the outer edge in\r\ncontact with the secondary xylem or are partially embedded in the\r\nxylem-cylinder. The examination of a series of sections demonstrated\r\nthe fusion of perimedullary with medullary strands and the occasional\r\nunion of the strands of both regions with one another. It appears that\r\nthe perimedullary strands are the leaf-traces while the strands deeper\r\nin the pith are merely branches from the peripheral leaf-trace strands.\r\n\r\nIn _Pitys antiqua_ the medullary xylem strands are confined to\r\nthe outer zone of the pith and constitute the leaf-traces: in\r\n_Archaeopitys_, on the other hand, the medullary strands are\r\nscattered through the pith and the leaf-traces are restricted to the\r\ncircummedullary region in actual contact with the secondary xylem. In\r\nthe Devonian genus _Callixylon_ there are similar strands but they are\r\nconfined to the edge of the pith and are usually in contact with the\r\nwood as are the circummedullary strands in _Archaeopitys_. The grouping\r\nof the secondary xylem of _Callixylon_ into wedge-shaped masses at the\r\ninner edge of the cylinder is a characteristic feature; this feature is\r\nless definite in _Archaeopitys_ and absent from _Pitys_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Callixylon.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\n_Callixylon Trifilievi_ Zalessky. This genus is represented by a\r\nsingle species[771], originally referred to _Dadoxylon_, founded on\r\nmaterial from Upper Devonian rocks in the Donetz basin, Russia, and\r\nbased solely on the anatomical characters of the secondary wood and\r\ncentral region of an arborescent stem. The wood is pycnoxylic and\r\nof the Araucarian type; the inner portion of the xylem-cylinder is\r\ndivided into groups, similar to the regular wedges in a Calamite stem,\r\nconsisting of tracheids converging towards an obtuse apex occupied by\r\na primary xylem strand, fig. 489, A, _a_, _b_. On the radial walls of\r\nthe tracheids the bordered pits not infrequently form a single row of\r\nflattened ovals, but more usually there are two or sometimes three\r\nrows of alternate contiguous pits (fig. 489, B): circular and separate\r\npits also occur. As Zalessky states, the pits do not always occupy the\r\nwhole radial face; unpitted patches sometimes interrupt the continuity\r\nof the pitted areas[772]. Similar circular and more scattered pits\r\nare unusually abundant on the tangential walls. There are no complete\r\nrings of growth. The medullary rays are narrow and, except at their\r\ndilated inner ends, uniseriate; usually one or a few cells deep, they\r\nmay reach a depth of 12 or more cells. The pits on the radial walls\r\nof the ray-cells are said to be 4–7 in the field. The pith consists\r\nof thin-walled flattened parenchyma frequently elongated in a radial\r\ndirection. At the inner edge of the secondary xylem and generally in\r\ncontact with it are several anastomosing strands of primary xylem,\r\nmesarch in structure but with the protoxylem nearer the inner edge.\r\nThese bundles may be single (fig. 489, A, _a_) or double (fig. 489, A,\r\n_b_, and C) and closely resemble those of _Pitys antiqua_ except in\r\ntheir closer relation to the secondary wood. The leaf-traces have not\r\nbeen described, but the occurrence of twin-bundles like those in fig.\r\n489, C, suggests that they were double. The primary-xylem elements\r\nshow particularly well transitional forms of pitting connecting the\r\nmultiseriate and scalariform types.\r\n\r\n_Callixylon_, though conveniently and justly regarded as a distinct\r\ngenus, exhibits in its primary xylem a fairly close agreement with\r\n_Pitys_[773]. The above account is based in part on Zalessky’s\r\ndescription and partly on specimens in Dr Kidston’s possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489. _Callixylon Trifilievi._ A, C, the inner\r\nmargin of the secondary xylem showing strands of primary xylem,\r\n_a_, _b_, and C. B, tracheids of the secondary xylem. (A, C, from\r\nphotographs supplied by Prof. Zalessky; B, Cambridge Botany School.)]\r\n\r\nMiss Elkins and W. Wieland[774] have recently described some Upper\r\nDevonian wood from Indiana characterised by a grouping of the circular\r\nor elliptical bordered pits in the radial walls of the tracheids\r\nsimilar to those in _Callixylon Trifilievi_ which they include\r\ntogether with the Middle Devonian species _Cordaites Newberryi_[775]\r\nin Zalessky’s genus. Though these two American species are comparable\r\nin the discontinuous arrangement of the tracheal pits with the\r\nRussian type the latter is characterised by the presence of primary\r\nxylem-strands, a feature that has not been recognised in the American\r\nstems: it would seem, then, undesirable to adopt the designation\r\n_Callixylon_ in preference to _Dadoxylon_ unless there is evidence as\r\nto similar characters in the primary region of the xylem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coenoxylon.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\n_Coenoxylon Scotti_ Zalessky. Prof. Zalessky[776] gave the name\r\n_Coenoxylon_ to a small and incomplete piece of stem of doubtful\r\nprovenance but possibly from the Ural Permian beds. The pith, 2 cm.\r\nbroad, consists of parenchyma associated in the central region with\r\nnumerous large sclerous cells. In one section a sinuous band of\r\nmeristematic tissue was observed near the periphery of the pith: the\r\nappearance of this tissue in a photograph given to me by Prof. Zalessky\r\nsuggests comparison with occasional strips of similar dividing cells\r\nin the pith of _Lyginopteris_. The secondary wood is composed of\r\ntracheids with 1–2 rows of flattened or hexagonal pits on the radial\r\nwalls and narrow uniseriate medullary rays reaching a depth of 15 cells\r\nand with 2–7 oval pits in the field. As in the wood of _Mesopitys\r\nTchihatcheffi_[777] there are distinct and apparently complete rings of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIt is on the ground of the arrangement and structure of the primary\r\nxylem that Zalessky instituted a new generic name. The primary xylem\r\nforms teeth of variable size which project into the pith from the edge\r\nof the secondary xylem: the prominent portions of the main mass of\r\nprimary xylem give off branches, differing considerably in size and\r\nshape, some of which become separated by a comparatively broad band\r\nof parenchyma from the parent xylem-tissue. These bundles anastomose\r\nin their course through the pith and in doing so incorporate between\r\nthem patches of parenchyma. The bundles of primary xylem are endarch.\r\nFrom the centrifugal strands at the periphery of the pith double\r\nleaf-traces are produced which pass almost horizontally through the\r\nsecondary wood. As Zalessky points out, the leaf-traces in their dual\r\nnature and in the elongated and narrow form of the tracheal groups,\r\nas seen in tangential section of the secondary wood, bear a close\r\nresemblance to those of _Ginkgo biloba_.\r\n\r\nThis Russian genus agrees in its double leaf-trace with _Mesoxylon_,\r\n_Mesopitys_, and _Antarcticoxylon_: among recent plants _Ginkgo_ would\r\nseem to be the most closely allied type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parapitys.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\nThe designation _Parapitys_[778] has been proposed for a single Upper\r\nCarboniferous species characterised by the possession of secondary wood\r\nlike that of _Cordaites_, double leaf-traces, and small mesarch primary\r\nxylem-strands. Nothing is known of the leaves or reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parapitys Spenceri_ (Scott).\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Williamson[779] published a short account of a transverse\r\nsection of a specimen found by Mr J. Spencer in Upper Carboniferous\r\nstrata near Halifax in Yorkshire which afforded evidence of the\r\noccurrence of double leaf-traces. The following description is taken\r\nfrom Scott’s account[780] of the species, which he named _Dadoxylon\r\nSpenceri_. The parenchymatous pith, 5–6 mm. in diameter, is obtusely\r\npentagonal, the prominent angles corresponding to the points of exit\r\nof paired leaf-traces like those of _Mesoxylon_, _Ginkgo_, and other\r\ngenera. The secondary xylem consists of narrow tracheids with crowded\r\nmultiseriate pits on the radial walls and narrow medullary rays\r\none-cell broad and 1–8 cells deep. In contact with the inner margin\r\nof the secondary wood are a few small mesarch strands of primary\r\nxylem, the protoxylem and some parenchyma occupying a more or less\r\ncentral position. A leaf-trace about to enter the secondary xylem is\r\nrepresented by twin-bundles which retain their double nature as they\r\ntraverse the stele, but at a lower level the two components fuse and\r\nappear as single bundles at the outer edge of the pith. The division\r\nof a leaf-trace into two before passing out, as in _Poroxylon_,\r\nconstitutes a difference from _Lyginopteris_ in which the division\r\noccurs later.\r\n\r\nZalessky’s generic name _Parapitys_ is an appropriate substitute for\r\n_Dadoxylon_ in view of the presence of separate primary xylem strands,\r\na feature foreign to typical Dadoxylons which agree with recent\r\nConifers and Cycads in the absence of vascular strands distinct from\r\nthe endarch centrifugal wood. As Scott[781] says, _Parapitys_ ‘is best\r\nregarded as a near ally of _Mesoxylon_.’\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mesopitys.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\n_Mesopitys Tchihatcheffi_ (Goeppert). The genus _Mesopitys_ was\r\ninstituted by Zalessky for a Permian species founded by Goeppert[782]\r\non a piece of decorticated stem from the Kousnetzk basin in Siberia\r\nand afterwards more fully described by Goeppert and Stenzel[783].\r\nThe structure of the secondary wood led Goeppert to adopt the name\r\n_Araucarites_ for which Kraus[784] substituted _Araucarioxylon_.\r\nA recent investigation of additional material by Zalessky brought\r\nto light the existence of groups of primary xylem abutting on the\r\nsecondary xylem and projecting into the pith, characterised by the\r\noccurrence of spiral protoxylem elements on the inner edge. The\r\nrecognition of this important feature justified Zalessky in the\r\nadoption of a new generic term. In general anatomical characters\r\n_Mesopitys_ agrees with _Eristophyton Beinertianum_ (Goepp.) but is\r\ndistinguished by the more feebly developed primary-xylem groups and by\r\ntheir endarch structure.\r\n\r\nThe examination of sections from some of Prof. Zalessky’s material\r\nlent to me by Dr Kidston enables me to confirm Zalessky’s description,\r\nthough I am not convinced that the primary xylem-strands are\r\nexclusively endarch: in most of the primary groups the protoxylem is\r\nclearly on the inner edge, but in a few cases there may be a small\r\namount of centripetal xylem present. The characters of _Mesopitys\r\nTchihatcheffi_ may be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\nAnnual rings well defined, varying considerably in breadth; the summer\r\nwood is represented by several rows of narrower tracheids (fig. 490,\r\nA). In the piece of stem shown in the figure the breadth of the wood\r\nfrom the flattened and crushed pith to the broken outer edge is 6 cm.\r\nThe medullary rays are numerous, uniseriate, rarely 2 cells in breadth;\r\nthe pits on the radial walls of the ray-cells, 7–10 in the field, are\r\napparently simple, oval, and oblique: the rays are generally 3–4 cells\r\nin depth but may be deeper. There are 1–3 rows of hexagonal alternate\r\nrows of pits on the radial walls of the tracheids. The primary xylem\r\nconsists of groups, varying in size and sometimes reduced to a very\r\nfew elements, in contact with the secondary xylem, usually though\r\nprobably not invariably endarch. In the two narrow radially elongated\r\nand partially destroyed primary strands shown in fig. 490, B, the\r\nprotoxylem, _px_, is on the inner edge. The leaf-trace passes through\r\nthe secondary wood as a single strand. In the section reproduced in\r\nfig. 490, A, the crushed and flattened pith measures 9 by 2 mm.; it\r\nconsists of thin-walled parenchyma with a few scattered thicker-walled\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 490. _Mesopitys Tchihatcheffi._ A, transverse\r\nsection showing rings of growth in the wood.

The specimen on which this\r\ngenus was founded was discovered by Mr Raymond Priestley[785] in a\r\nboulder, probably derived from the Upper Beacon sandstone, on the\r\nPriestley Glacier south of 74° S. lat. in the course of the journey\r\nof the Northern Party of Capt. Scott’s second Antarctic Expedition.\r\nThe type-specimen is a piece of silicified stem 1 ft long and 3\r\nins. in diameter; there were no tissues preserved external to the\r\nsecondary wood and it is impossible to say what proportion of the\r\noriginal thickness is represented. Annual rings are clearly marked\r\nat least macroscopically (fig. 491, C) though there is very little\r\ndifference between the spring and summer tracheids: the centre of the\r\ncompressed stem is occupied by a lighter coloured elliptical area 7\r\n× 2 mm. which superficially resembles a pith, but in the peripheral\r\nregion it consists of portions of a cylinder of spiral and scalariform\r\ntracheids, the actual pith being not more than 2–3 mm. in breadth.\r\nThe pith consists of lacunar parenchyma separated by horizontal bands\r\nof dark cells containing some secreted substance (fig. 491, F): the\r\npreservation is, however, not sufficiently good to enable one to\r\ndescribe it in detail. The secondary xylem is of the pycnoxylic type;\r\nthe tracheids have either a single row of contiguous and partially\r\nflattened pits on their radial walls or a double row of alternate\r\npolygonal pits; the medullary rays are nearly always uniseriate\r\n(fig. 491, E) and from 1 to 24 cells in depth. At the inner edge of\r\nthe secondary wood there was a fairly broad zone of more delicate\r\ntracheids (fig. 491, A, _x_) characterised by spiral or scalariform\r\nbands and by their relatively small diameter. This innermost zone,\r\nwhich supplies the leaf-traces, is spoken of as the primary xylem; it\r\nappears to be endarch though this cannot be definitely determined.\r\nA characteristic feature of the primary xylem in the perimedullary\r\nregion, as also in the leaf-traces on their way through the secondary\r\nwood, is the presence of short and broad tracheids (fig. 491, D, _t_)\r\nwith reticulate thickening bands: these short elements may represent\r\ncentripetal xylem and are similar to the short tracheids described\r\nby Scott[786] in the sheath of _Mesoxylon Lomaxi_ and to the larger\r\nelements in the stem of _Megaloxylon_[787].\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature seen in transverse sections of the secondary\r\nwood is the occurrence of light bands concentric with the rings of\r\ngrowth which are broadest near the long axis of the stem (fig. 491, C).\r\nIn their narrower parts these bands are clearly due to the partial\r\ndestruction of the secondary tracheids, but in other places crushed\r\nparenchymatous tissue occurs which may be a traumatic phenomenon or\r\npossibly comparable with Nördlinger’s ‘medullary spots[788]’ formed\r\nby local hypertrophy of medullary tissue. Although the structure of\r\nthe leaf-traces cannot be definitely determined, it would seem that\r\neach trace passed into the perimedullary region as a single bundle of\r\nrelatively large size composed of spiral and scalariform tracheids\r\nnarrower than the secondary elements. The traces during their outward\r\ncourse were accompanied by some parenchymatous tissue continuous with\r\nthat in the pith, and the inner spiral tracheids of the trace were\r\nconnected with isodiametric reticulate elements. The dimensions of the\r\nleaf-traces point to leaves of fairly large size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 491.

There\r\nis no evidence of the occurrence of double leaf-traces such as\r\ncharacterise certain Cordaitalean genera and some existing members of\r\nthe Araucarineae. In the single nature of the leaf-traces the Antarctic\r\nstem resembles _Mesopitys Tchihatcheffi_ also in the presence of rings\r\nof growth[789], but in _Antarcticoxylon_ the preservation of the\r\nprimary xylem is too imperfect to admit of any satisfactory comparison\r\nas regards this important tissue with other types.\r\n\r\nThe precise age of the Beacon sandstone has not been determined,\r\nbut the probability is that the upper beds from which the boulder\r\ncontaining _Antarcticoxylon_ was derived are not older than the Rhaetic\r\nperiod. The chief interest of this imperfectly preserved stem with\r\nundoubted Araucarian affinities is its occurrence in the rocks of\r\nAntarctica in association with other remains of comparatively large\r\nstems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n                    PALAEOZOIC GYMNOSPERMOUS SEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeds are abundantly represented as fossils from Carboniferous to\r\nPost-Tertiary deposits. The importance of fossil and sub-fossil\r\nspecies in the later geological series has been demonstrated by the\r\ninvestigations of Mr and Mrs Clement Reid and a few other workers in\r\nthis neglected field. In cases where it is possible to assign seeds\r\nto their parent-plants the descriptions of casts, impressions, or\r\npetrifactions are added to the account of vegetative organs; but\r\nit frequently happens that seeds are preserved only as detached\r\nspecimens many of which have little or no value as botanical records,\r\nwhile others that afford striking examples of the possibilities of\r\npetrifaction as a means of preserving the most delicate structures,\r\nare of great importance. In Volume +ii.+ an account was given of such\r\nPalaeozoic seed-bearing organs as _Lepidocarpon_ and _Miadesmia_, and\r\nthe genera _Lagenostoma_, _Sphaerostoma_, and _Trigonocarpus_ are\r\ndealt with in this volume under _Lyginopteris_, _Heterangium_, and\r\n_Medullosa_. Certain seeds afford some evidence as to the systematic\r\nposition of the parent-plants though insufficient to warrant more than\r\na surmise as to the nature of the vegetative organs: in several cases\r\nit is only from the resemblance of detached seeds to types that on the\r\nstrength of more or less convincing evidence are referred to definite\r\nparent-plants that any conclusions can be drawn with regard to precise\r\nsystematic position. In view of the occurrence of several different\r\ntypes of seeds that retain their morphological features, but cannot be\r\nassigned with any degree of certainty to genera founded on vegetative\r\norgans, a special chapter is devoted to a comparative study of selected\r\nexamples with the object of directing attention to data bearing on\r\nevolutionary problems. The chief interest of Palaeozoic seeds to the\r\nbotanist lies in the facts they contribute towards the elucidation\r\nof questions connected with the promotion of the megasporangium and\r\nmegaspore of the Pteridophyta to the higher stage represented by the\r\nintegumented megasporangium (nucellus) and single megaspore that in\r\nthe main fulfil the definition of a seed[790]. ‘With the evolution\r\nof the seed,’ as Oliver says, ‘the plant rose at a bound to a higher\r\nplane, and this structure in its perfected form has become the very\r\ncentre of the plant’s existence[791].’ We can as yet form a very\r\npartial conception of the successive stages in the adoption of the\r\nseed-habit, but since 1855, the year in which Hooker and Binney[792]\r\npublished their paper on the structure of _Trigonocarpus_, ample\r\nproof has been furnished of the importance of Palaeozoic seeds from\r\nthe standpoint of affinity between recent Gymnosperms and extinct\r\nseed-bearing plants, and of the _modus operandi_ of evolutionary\r\ntendencies. A cursory examination of Palaeozoic seeds suffices to\r\ndemonstrate their resemblance to those of recent Cycads and the seed\r\nof _Ginkgo biloba_; but while it is clearly with these Gymnosperms\r\nthat the majority of the seeds described in the following pages are\r\nmost closely allied, the extinct types possess many distinguishing\r\nfeatures that throw light on some at least of the factors concerned in\r\nthe production of the modern type. In many of the Palaeozoic seeds the\r\nnucellus stands free within the integument, to which it is attached\r\nonly in the chalazal region, in contrast to the lateral union between\r\nintegument and nucellus in the ovules of recent Cycads. It has been\r\nsuggested by Oliver[793] that the seed of the Conifer _Torreya_ affords\r\na clue to the interpretation of this difference and that the lower part\r\nof the seed in Cycads and _Torreya_ represents a later intercalation\r\nin the basal portion of the ovule, the ancient type having a free\r\nnucellus in contrast to the nucellus of modern seeds which is free\r\nonly at the apex. It has been objected[794] that there are no adequate\r\ngrounds for assuming the addition of an intercalated zone or of the\r\nelongation of the ovule that this implies, the more probable view\r\nbeing that the lateral union of nucellus and integument represents\r\ncongenital fusion in the ancestral type, a fusion comparable with that\r\nof the coherent petals of a gamopetalous corolla. In the presence of a\r\npollen-chamber most of the Palaeozoic seeds agree with those of recent\r\nCycads, but in the extinct forms it is usually a more highly developed\r\nstructure. The name pollen-chamber was given by Brongniart[795] to\r\nthe pollen-containing cavity in the free region of the nucellus in\r\nthe petrified seeds from St Étienne in ignorance of the use of the\r\nsame term by Griffith[796] in a posthumous work published in 1852 for\r\nthe nucellar chamber in _Cycas_[797]. The genus _Stephanospermum_\r\n(fig. 494, A) illustrates the means by which the pollen-chamber was\r\nliberally supplied with water and thus adapted to the requirements of\r\nfertilisation by motile gametes. The pollen-chamber and its vascular\r\nsupply paved the way for siphonogamy, that is the development of a\r\npollen-tube for the more direct transmission of the male sperms. The\r\nhighly developed mantle of tracheal tissue at the periphery of the\r\nnucellus in _Stephanospermum_, represented on a reduced scale by the\r\nseparate vascular strands of other seeds, may be compared with the\r\ntracheal investment to the nucellus in the recent Dicotyledonous genus\r\n_Cassytha_[798]. The presence of a nucellar vascular system in several\r\nPalaeozoic seeds is a feature in which they differ from those of recent\r\nCycads with the exception of _Bowenia_. The retreat of the vascular\r\nsupply from the immediate neighbourhood of the pollen-chamber in recent\r\nCycads may, as Oliver points out, be correlated with the evolution of\r\nthe pollen-tube—the substitution of siphonogamy for zoidiogamy. The\r\ndiagram reproduced in fig. 492 represents a synthetic type based on\r\nsuch seeds as _Stephanospermum_ and _Cardiocarpus_ which illustrate an\r\narrangement of conducting tissue frequently found in Palaeozoic seeds:\r\nthe main strand gives off a pair of bundles in the sarcotesta in the\r\nprincipal plane, as in _Cardiocarpus_[799]; from the tracheal mass in\r\nthe chalazal region numerous bundles pass up the nucellus as far as the\r\nfloor of the pollen-chamber. The nature of the vascular supply in this\r\ngeneralised type and in individual genera should be compared with that\r\nin the seeds of recent Cycads[800] described in Chapter +xxviii.+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492. ‘A conjectural synthetic type of seed\r\nembodying the characters of such a seed as _Stephanospermum_ with those\r\nof a _Cardiocarpus’_; _n_, nucellus; _pc_, pollen-chamber. (After\r\nOliver.)]\r\n\r\nRecent research has revealed the not unexpected fact that in such\r\nUpper Carboniferous petrified seeds as have been investigated—a\r\nsmall proportion of the large number produced in the Palaeozoic\r\nforests—there was a remarkable range in the mechanism connected with\r\npollination and the maturation of the microspores. A comparison of\r\nthe genera _Physostoma_, _Lagenostoma_, _Conostoma_, _Trigonocarpus_,\r\n_Stephanospermum_ and others reveals the occurrence of very different\r\nthough not unrelated structural features especially in the apical\r\nregion of the seed. These seeds, including _Physostoma_, probably the\r\nmost archaic type, represent a stage in evolution already far removed\r\nfrom the starting-point: the diversity of plan recalls the variety in\r\nthe form of the chloroplasts in the Green Algae, and in both cases\r\nwe are in touch with an experimental phase representing a tentative\r\nadvance towards greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn its differentiation into an outer fleshy region, the sarcotesta, a\r\nstony layer, the sclerotesta, and in many cases an inner flesh, the\r\nPalaeozoic seeds resemble recent Cycads: in both extinct and modern\r\nseeds the balance of evidence would seem to be in favour of attributing\r\na single rather than a double origin to the integument.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous types of Palaeozoic seeds are several which\r\ninvite comparison with the fruits or carpels, apart from the seeds,\r\nof Angiosperms. Impressions of _Samaropsis_ seeds (figs. 502, B–K;\r\n503; 504) bear a close resemblance to the laterally expanded fruits\r\nof the common Crucifer _Thlaspi arvense_; the ribbed testa of\r\n_Hexagonocarpus_ (fig. 506, H) and other genera recalls the fruit-wall\r\nof _Alstroemeria_; the recently described Lower Carboniferous seed\r\n_Thysanotesta sagittula_ Nath. (fig. 506, F) simulates a carpel of\r\n_Erodium_. These and similar instances of a close parallelism in\r\nexternal features between organs that are not homologous, though in\r\nthemselves of no morphological significance, are at least interesting\r\nas illustrating the plasticity displayed by reproductive structures,\r\nwhich in the Palaeozoic period marked a morphological achievement\r\ncomparable in its importance with the still greater achievement\r\nrepresented by the highly specialised fruits of the modern Flowering\r\nplants. The range in form and surface-features of Angiospermous\r\nfruits was foreshadowed by Palaeozoic seeds. Structural types and\r\nin some cases, superadded to these, features which may reasonably\r\nbe supposed to have facilitated dispersal had been acquired by the\r\nseeds of Palaeozoic plants in forms that in a much later period were\r\nadopted by fruits even to a greater degree than by seeds. Characters\r\nuseful in seed-dispersal, that are now shared by fruits and seeds,\r\nare illustrated by the fleshy and possibly edible seeds of extinct\r\nGymnosperms, the plumes and hairy beak of _Gnetopsis_ (fig. 494,\r\nE) and _Thysanotesta_ (fig. 506, F) suggestive of feathery stigmas\r\nand other appendages. The lacunar sarcotesta of _Aetheotesta_, the\r\nthick endotesta of _Pachytesta_ (fig. 497), and the air-chamber of\r\n_Codonospermum_ (fig. 498), are strictly comparable with aids to\r\nbuoyancy in fruits of existing Flowering plants. The mucilage-hairs and\r\nsuperficial cells in _Physostoma_ (fig. 494, I) and _Stephanospermum_\r\nmay be compared with the thick mucilaginous investment of the\r\nmegaspores of recent water-ferns and with similar tissues of some\r\nAngiospermous seeds.\r\n\r\nThe bionomics of Palaeozoic plants is a subject worthy of more\r\nserious attention than it has so far received. The search for\r\nmorphological characters that may have facilitated the wanderings\r\nof widely distributed genera and species and a closer investigation\r\nof physiological-anatomical problems presented by the vegetative\r\norgans of petrified plants would not only extend our knowledge of the\r\nmorphology of ancient types but would stimulate comparative study\r\nand, incidentally, relieve the dullness of pure description. It may\r\nbe argued that we should first establish a more solid foundation\r\nby further observations on living plants; but even at the risk of\r\nallowing speculation too free a hand the attempt is worth making, and\r\nit may be urged that, as in phylogenetic enquiries so in other branches\r\nof botany, facts obtained from plants of other ages may serve to\r\nsupply deficiencies in knowledge based only on existing forms. One of\r\nthe difficulties inseparable from the study of fossil plants, namely\r\nthe identification of impressions and casts with specimens exhibiting\r\nanatomical characters, is particularly well illustrated by seeds. The\r\ndescription of a genus based on mere external form may sometimes be\r\nextended without great risk of error to include species founded on\r\nanatomical characters, but on the other hand, there are many instances\r\nin which—despite a general resemblance in form and size between\r\npetrifactions and impressions—lack of evidence of generic identity\r\nrequires the employment of distinctive names. The determination of\r\nimpressions is, as Lesquereux recognised, ‘subject to a great deal of\r\nuncertainty,’ and many of the genera founded on external features are\r\npurely artificial and include species that have no essential features\r\nin common. Moreover in the case of petrified specimens the apparent\r\nabsence of an external fleshy layer is often due to destruction before\r\npreservation: as Solms-Laubach[801] points out, it is obviously\r\nimpossible to be certain as to the number of integumental layers\r\nin seeds that are not well preserved in all their parts. Goeppert\r\nfounded a new genus, _Acanthocarpus_, on a Permian seed described as\r\n_A. xanthioides_[802], because of the occurrence of spinous processes\r\nattached to an obcordate kernel: these apparent spines are in all\r\nprobability the remains of a very imperfectly preserved sarcotesta. The\r\npreservation of the central portion of a seed, that is the seed-cavity\r\nwith the enclosing shell, conveniently called the nucule, has often led\r\nto an unnecessary multiplication of generic terms. Other examples of\r\nconfusion resulting from different states of preservation are quoted in\r\nthe accounts of some of the selected types.\r\n\r\nWilliamson in 1877 pointed out that we learn from the large number\r\nof different kinds of Palaeozoic seeds that ‘there were in the\r\nCarboniferous forests many gymnospermous stems clothed with foliage\r\nof which we have not yet discovered any traces, probably because\r\nthese Gymnosperms did not flourish upon the low swampy grounds which\r\nwere the homes of the great mass of the coal-producing plants[803].’\r\nProf. Zeiller[804] has also drawn attention to the numerical excess of\r\nseeds over vegetative organs. This discrepancy has to a large extent\r\nbeen explained by the discovery that many of the supposed Ferns were\r\nseed-bearing plants, and a further explanation is suggested by the\r\nsuperiority of seeds over stems and leaves in their adaptation to\r\ndispersal by water.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Brongniart[805] described several petrified seeds from material\r\ndiscovered by Grand’Eury in the St Étienne coal-field, and seven years\r\nlater his descriptions were republished[806], with the addition of\r\nseveral beautifully executed drawings, as a posthumous volume edited by\r\nhis distinguished pupil Renault. Williamson’s researches supplied much\r\nadditional information, and in recent years the more detailed study of\r\nFrench and English seeds by Bertrand and particularly by Oliver and\r\nhis pupils has further emphasised the interest and importance of this\r\nfield of work. Brongniart proposed a two-fold classification of French\r\nseeds: (i) bilaterally symmetrical seeds, more or less flattened in\r\nsection, which he believed to be Cordaitean; (ii) radially symmetrical\r\nseeds, circular in transverse section: the latter group he considered\r\nto be less closely allied to recent types. The employment of the\r\nterms Platyspermeae and Radiospermeae, proposed by Oliver[807] for\r\nBrongniart’s divisions, serves a useful purpose if due regard is paid\r\nto the adequacy of the evidence as to symmetry and if it is recognised\r\nthat this classification cannot be rigidly employed in all cases.\r\nIt was pointed out by Brongniart that the occasional occurrence of\r\ntricarinate seeds of _Ginkgo_ (fig. 631) and _Taxus_ is an exception\r\nto the general rule of bilateral symmetry: seeds of _Cycas_ are\r\nnormally bilateral, but radially symmetrical forms also occur[808].\r\nThe genus _Conostoma_ (fig. 494, B) represents an intermediate\r\ntype which, though almost radially symmetrical, exhibits a slight\r\ntendency towards platyspermy. Evidence recently brought forward by\r\nNathorst[809] renders probable a connexion of a presumably radiospermic\r\nseed _Lagenospermum Arberi_[810] with the Lower Carboniferous fronds\r\n_Adiantites bellidulus_ Heer, and this furnishes an interesting\r\nillustration of the association of both platyspermic and radiospermic\r\nseeds with the same generic type of foliage. While retaining Radiosperm\r\nand Platysperm as convenient descriptive terms, I have not adopted them\r\nas group-designations on the ground that they do not in themselves\r\nserve as trustworthy criteria of relationship. Attention is called\r\nby Salisbury[811] to the occurrence of bilaterally and radially\r\nsymmetrical fruits among British Carices and to a similar mixture in\r\nthe family Polygonaceae.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of more detailed and accurate knowledge of Palaeozoic\r\nseeds led to an extension of the two-fold division of Brongniart\r\nand Oliver which is based on such characters as the position of the\r\nvascular tissue in relation to the integument and nucellus, the form of\r\nthe pollen-chamber, and other features. The division Lagenostomales has\r\nbeen instituted for _Lagenostoma_ and some other Radiosperms connected\r\nby certain important characters: these seeds may be referred to the\r\nPteridospermeae though it is only in the case of _Lagenostoma_, and to\r\na less extent _Sphaerostoma_, that a correlation between vegetative\r\norgans and seeds has been rendered sufficiently probable to justify\r\nan assumption of generic identity. The name Trigonocarpeae[812]\r\nhas recently been used for a section of Radiosperms represented by\r\n_Trigonocarpus_, _Stephanospermum_, and other genera. Although the\r\ngenus _Stephanospermum_, as Oliver[813] says, may be regarded as\r\nthe type-genus of a group of seeds, it is more fitting, as the same\r\nauthor[814] insists, to adopt a divisional term based on the generic\r\nname of the much more widely spread and more familiar _Trigonocarpus_.\r\nFor the sake of uniformity in nomenclature it is proposed to adopt\r\nthe name Trigonocarpales instead of Trigonocarpeae to rank with\r\nLagenostomales.\r\n\r\nThe Platyspermeae comprise such seeds as _Cardiocarpus_,\r\n_Mitrospermum_, and _Rhabdospermum_, genera characterised by\r\nwell-marked anatomical features and probably Cordaitean; it has,\r\nhowever, been shown that typical Platysperms were also borne on leaves\r\nof Pteridosperms and, as Mrs Arber[815] says, the notion that every\r\nmember of the Platyspermeae was necessarily a Cordaitean seed has been\r\ndiscredited by the discovery of the seeds of _Aneimites_ (_Wardia_)\r\nand _Pecopteris Pluckeneti_[816]. For general purposes it is hardly\r\nnecessary to adopt the subdivisions of the Lagenostomales used by\r\nOliver and Salisbury[817], though as facts accumulate we shall no\r\ndoubt be able to make further advances towards a natural system of\r\nclassification. The following three divisions of Permo-Carboniferous\r\nseeds include genera founded on petrified specimens and thus\r\nafford valuable morphological data. The groups Lagenostomales and\r\nTrigonocarpales include types belonging to closely related plants, a\r\nrelationship clearly expressed in the seed-characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. +Lagenostomales.+\r\n\r\nThe seeds included in this group are for the most part Radiosperms, but\r\nin its slightly developed bilateral symmetry _Conostoma oblongum_ is a\r\ntype transitional between Radiosperms and Platysperms. The testa may\r\nbe ribbed and the ribs vary in number. The nucellus (megasporangium)\r\nis united to the integument not only at the base but laterally as\r\nfar as the shoulder of the seed up to a level corresponding to the\r\nbase of the pollen-chamber (lagenostome) as in all recent Cycads\r\nand in the majority of Conifers. The seeds proper apart from the\r\ncupule are supplied with a single set of vascular bundles; there is\r\nno vascular tissue in the nucellus, a feature no doubt correlated\r\nwith the fusion of nucellus and integument[818]. The free portion of\r\nthe integument is more or less deeply lobed or, in _Lagenostoma_, it\r\nforms a pyramidal canopy of fused lobes enclosing the lagenostome. The\r\npresence of a tapetal zone surrounding the megaspore is believed to\r\nbe a feature characteristic of the group[819]. The testa, wholly or\r\npartially ribbed, is relatively thinner than in the Trigonocarpales and\r\nCardiocarpales, and in its differentiation agrees less closely with\r\nthe testa of recent Cycadean seeds. In _Lagenostoma_ and possibly in\r\nother genera a loose sheath or cupule surrounded the ovule, while in\r\n_Gnetopsis_ a similar envelope enclosed two to four seeds.\r\n\r\nThe microspores are multicellular and smaller than those of\r\nTrigonocarpales, the average dimensions (_Conostoma_, _Physostoma_,\r\n_Lagenostoma_) being 67μ × 52μ.\r\n\r\nGenera. _Physostoma_; _Conostoma_; _Sphaerostoma_; _Lagenostoma_;\r\n_Gnetopsis_.\r\n\r\n_Lagenostoma_ may safely be referred to _Lyginopteris_, and\r\n_Sphaerostoma_ with but little risk of error to _Heterangium_: the\r\nparent-plants of the other genera are unknown, but all may be regarded\r\nas the seeds of Pteridosperms and probably of genera more nearly\r\nallied to the Lyginopterideae than to the Medulloseae. The genus\r\n_Lagenospermum_, recently instituted by Nathorst[820], is dealt with in\r\nChapter +xxxi.+\r\n\r\n\r\n=Physostoma.= Williamson.\r\n\r\n_Physostoma elegans_ Williamson.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Physostoma_[821] was applied by Williamson[822] to\r\na seed from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire which he named _P.\r\nelegans_; he afterwards described it as _Lagenostoma physoides_, but\r\nthe original name has been revived by Oliver[823] to whom our knowledge\r\nof this type is chiefly due. The specimens figured by Williamson[824]\r\nas _Sporocarpon ornatum_ also belong to _Physostoma elegans_. The\r\nseeds are circular in section, approximately 6 mm. long with a maximum\r\ndiameter of 2 mm. The testa has about 10 longitudinal ribs passing in\r\nthe apical region into a ring of free lobes or tentacles surrounding\r\nand considerably overtopping the nucellar apex: these tentacles take\r\nthe place of a micropylar tube (fig. 494, I; fig. 493, D) and are a\r\nfeature ‘in which this seed differs from all other known seeds, fossil\r\nor recent[825].’ A single vascular strand passes through the chalazal\r\nregion and divides into 10 bundles, one to each rib and tentacle.\r\nThe single integument consists of a few layers of cells, those of\r\nthe epidermis being prolonged into clavate mucilaginous hairs, fig.\r\n494, I, _h_, that may reach a length of ·5 mm. and in the living seed\r\nalmost covered the whole surface of the testa, being especially long\r\non the ribs and tentacles. There is no special development of sclerous\r\ntissue, the vascular bundles, _v_, being embedded in parenchyma in\r\nthe inner portion of the integument. The nucellus is represented by\r\na zone rich in secretory cells, and internal to this is a tapetum.\r\nIntegument and nucellus are coalescent up to the apical region where\r\nthe former splits into 10 tentacles. The nucellar apex has the form of\r\na tall dome surrounded by a bell-shaped pollen-chamber (fig. 494, I,\r\n_pc_; fig. 493, C, D, _c_) into which it projects like the base of a\r\nwine-bottle. The circular opening of the pollen-chamber overtops the\r\nroof of the dome formed of the secretory tissue of the nucellus and the\r\ncarbonised remains of the tapetum: this dark band surrounds the large\r\nmegaspore-cavity (fig. 494, I). _Physostoma_ is the only member of the\r\nLagenostomales in which the megaspore projects into the free nucellar\r\napex: in other genera intercalary growth has produced a more or less\r\nprominent plinth, the name given to the free portion of the nucellus\r\nbetween the megaspore and the pollen-chamber. Williamson[826] described\r\nthe mammillated apex of the nucellus as pushed up into the base of the\r\nlagenostome which ‘looks like a bladder half full of fluid resting\r\nupon and overhanging the end of a soda-water bottle’: it was this\r\nappearance that suggested the name _Physostoma_. The section reproduced\r\nin fig. 493, D, shows in the centre the limiting tissue of the nucellus\r\nsurrounded by the pollen-chamber, _c_, and external to this are the\r\ntentacles with their groups of long hairs: the vascular bundles are\r\nrepresented by spaces in the more internal small-celled tissue (see\r\nalso fig. 494, I). A characteristic feature is the presence of a\r\ntapetum or megaspore-jacket[827] in the nucellus: immediately internal\r\nto the vascular bundles stretching from the chalaza to the apex of the\r\nmegaspore-cavity is a layer of delicate cells with secretory sacs,\r\nand this is succeeded by a broad black layer of rather larger cells,\r\na tissue which was probably in full activity in a younger stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493.

No archegonia have\r\nbeen found, but in a few cases some of the delicate prothallus-tissue\r\noccurs in the interior of the seed. Microspores are often abundant\r\nin the pollen-chamber (fig. 493, C, _c_); in one seed 80 are\r\nrecorded. The occurrence of so many microspores suggested to Oliver\r\nthat insect-agency may have been responsible for the precision in\r\npollination that is greater than one would expect in anemophilous\r\nplants. The spores are smaller than those of _Lagenostoma_ (55μ × 45μ)\r\nand in several of them the remains of a cellular tissue are preserved\r\n(fig. 494, N), also some sub-reniform bodies (fig. 494, M) similar to\r\nthose described as spermatozoids by Dr Benson in _Lagenostoma_ (fig.\r\n408, D).\r\n\r\nThe most interesting features of _Physostoma_ are: the absence of\r\na continuous micropylar tube and its replacement by a circle of\r\nintegumental lobes; the apical prolongation of the nucellar apex into\r\nthe pollen-chamber, and the presence of long mucilaginous hairs on the\r\nintegument. The large pollen-chamber is a character which distinguishes\r\n_Physostoma_ from _Conostoma_ and its form is very different from that\r\nin _Lagenostoma_.\r\n\r\nThe tentacles of the integument and the form of the nucellar apex are\r\nfeatures consistent with Oliver’s view that _Physostoma_ is the most\r\nprimitive of Palaeozoic seeds though, as Burlingame[829] says, the\r\nelaborate form of the encasing envelope marks a considerable advance\r\nbeyond the earliest type of megasporangium integument.\r\n\r\nA new type of _Physostoma_ has been briefly described by Gordon[830],\r\nwithout a specific designation, from the Lower Carboniferous beds of\r\nPettycur (Fife): it was found in association with _Heterangium_ and\r\n_Sphaerostoma ovale_.\r\n\r\nWe have no knowledge of the plant to which _Physostoma_ belonged,\r\nbut the general plan of organisation of the seed points to a near\r\nrelationship to _Lagenostoma_ and presumably, as regards the\r\nparent-plant, to a genus related to _Lyginopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Conostoma.= Williamson.\r\n\r\nThis name[831], suggested by the funnel-like pollen-chamber or\r\nlagenostome, was applied by Williamson[832] to some seeds from the\r\nLower Coal Measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire and from the Lower\r\nCarboniferous beds of Burntisland. The Burntisland seeds, referred by\r\nWilliamson to two species, have recently been united and described\r\nby Miss Benson as _Sphaerostoma ovale_[833]. The English species has\r\nbeen thoroughly investigated by Oliver and Salisbury[834] who have\r\nalso described a second species, _C. anglo-germanicum_, from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Lancashire and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conostoma oblongum_ Williamson.\r\n\r\nThis rare type is represented by approximately cylindrical seeds with\r\nan average length of 5 mm. and a maximum breadth of 2·3 mm. borne on\r\na relatively stout stalk and tapering to a blunt apex characterised\r\nby a canopy of six short lobes (fig. 494, B, C) in marked contrast to\r\nthe long tentacles of _Physostoma_. In the basal region the integument\r\nhas six prominent ribs which soon die out when traced upwards: a\r\ntransverse section through the body of the seed is hexagonal (fig.\r\n494, D), the angles corresponding to the basal ribs, and there is a\r\nslight tendency to platyspermy. The testa has an epidermal mucilaginous\r\nlayer which becomes exfoliated through the lifting-up of the cuticle\r\nby the underlying mucilage: below this, at the apex of the seed, is\r\na cap of fleshy tissue (fig. 494, B, _sa_) which, it is suggested,\r\nmay have had a secretory function in connexion with a drop-mechanism\r\nin pollination like that in recent Conifers. No microspores have\r\nbeen found in the pollen-chamber. The epidermis, called by Oliver\r\nand Salisbury the blow-off layer (fig. 494, B, _m_), together with\r\nthe cap of soft tissue constitute a feebly developed sarcotesta. A\r\nsclerotesta consisting of a palisade-layer and a fibrous hypoderm\r\nextends over the main body of the seed below the epidermis; it forms\r\nthe basal ribs and increases considerably in breadth at the apical\r\nregion to form a sclerous cone penetrated by six strands of parenchyma\r\nenclosing vascular bundles (fig. 494, D) which pass up from the\r\nconducting tissue immediately external to the nucellus. The nucellus\r\nis coalescent with the integument, as in _Physostoma_, as far as the\r\nlevel of the domical free apex of the nucellus where the tapetal tissue\r\nthat lines the seed-cavity passes across the almost flat top of the\r\ncentral region originally occupied by the megaspore. In some sections\r\nprothallus-tissue was found with an apical ‘tent-pole’ protuberance.\r\nA striking feature of _Conostoma_ is the mechanism for the reception\r\nof the microspores. The free part of the nucellus consists of the\r\nplinth, a broad tapering region originally filled with parenchyma but\r\nin most cases represented only by its epidermis: the plinth, _p_, is\r\nseen in fig. 494, B, to be two-storeyed, the upper and narrower storey\r\nbeing a space formerly filled by a pad of tissue suspended from the\r\nfloor of the superposed lagenostome (pollen-chamber)[835]. The greater\r\ndevelopment of the domical plinth is a feature in which _Conostoma_\r\ndiffers from _Physostoma_. At the apex of the plinth and resting on\r\na slight depression is a small lagenostome, bowl-shaped in section,\r\nand like the pollen-chamber of _Lagenostoma_, formed as the result of\r\nenzyme-action on the apical papilla of the nucellus (fig. 494, B, B′,\r\n_l′_). The mouth of the lagenostome engages with the micropylar tube by\r\na projecting flange (fig. 494, B′, _f_) of tissue lining the micropylar\r\ncanal and by a second flange (_f′_) at the base of the lagenostome\r\nwhere the roof of the plinth (fig. 494, B′, _p_) bends downwards and\r\ninwards. The walls of the lagenostome are formed by strong cells with\r\nthickening bands giving them the appearance of tracheids (_l′_),\r\nbut the floor of the lagenostome is made of thinner cells which\r\nbecome disorganised, allowing the microspores to fall into the large\r\nplinth-cavity below (_p_, fig. 494, B), an arrangement comparable\r\nwith the two-storeyed pollen-chamber of _Bowenia_[836] and, to a less\r\nextent, with the micropyle of the Conifer _Tsuga_. The microspores are\r\nmulticellular and ellipsoidal measuring 75μ × 65μ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 494.

In _Conostoma_ the tracheid-like elements of the\r\nlateral wall of the lagenostome are a characteristic feature, and no\r\nevidence has been found of the existence of a central core of tissue\r\nsuch as occupies the centre of the seed-apex in _Lagenostoma_. The\r\nlong hairs of _Physostoma_ are represented in _Conostoma_ by the much\r\nsmaller mucilaginous cells of the epidermis and in _Lagenostoma_ by\r\nthe less closely united mucilage-cells of the superficial layer of the\r\ntesta.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sphaerostoma.= Benson.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out in Chapter +xxix.+ where this genus is described\r\nas probably the seed of _Heterangium_, there is a fairly close general\r\nresemblance between _Sphaerostoma_ and _Lagenostoma_. In the presence\r\nof free apical lobes the former genus resembles _Conostoma_, and\r\nwhile agreeing with _Lagenostoma_ in its annular pollen-chamber it\r\nis peculiar in the retention of an epidermis over the roof of the\r\npollen-chamber: as in _Lagenostoma_ the seed is enclosed by an outer\r\nintegument or cupule.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lagenostoma.= Williamson.\r\n\r\nAn account of this type of seed is included in the description of\r\n_Lyginopteris_[837]. The more striking peculiarities are exhibited by\r\nthe pollen-chamber and the free region of the integument: the annular\r\npollen-chamber (fig. 493, D, _c_; fig. 409) surrounds a central\r\nnucellar cone and is prolonged upwards as a tube engaging with the\r\nmicropyle in contrast to the form of the pollen-chamber and the absence\r\nof a tubular prolongation in _Conostoma_. The tentacles of _Physostoma_\r\nand the short apical lobes of _Conostoma_ are replaced by an apical\r\ncone formed by the coalescence of the integument containing nine\r\ncavities originally filled with parenchyma (figs. 409; 493, B). The\r\npresence of a cupule is a characteristic feature of young seeds, but\r\nfrom negative evidence in the case of most other seeds it is unsafe\r\nto assume that the cupule of _Lagenostoma_ is an exceptional feature.\r\nThe nucellus and testa are united as far as the shoulders of the seed\r\nas in the seeds of recent Cycads and in contrast to their lateral\r\nindependence in _Trigonocarpus_, _Stephanospermum_, and other genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gnetopsis.= Renault.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was given by Renault[838] to some small petrified\r\nseeds from the Stephanian of Grand’ Croix and to impressions from the\r\nCommentry coal-field which he believed to belong to some Gnetaceous\r\nplant. Saporta and Marion[839] and other authors have accepted\r\nthese seeds as evidence of the existence of Palaeozoic Gnetales: it\r\nhas, however, been shown[840] that _Gnetopsis_ has no claim to such\r\nrelationship and is a type of seed closely allied to _Conostoma_.\r\nRenault described three species, afterwards adding three from another\r\nlocality[841]; the genus is recorded also from Commentry[842] and\r\nGard[843]. More recently Depape and Carpentier[844] have described\r\nexamples from the Westphalian of Valenciennes which they place in\r\nthe Pteridosperms in accordance with the conclusion of Oliver and\r\nSalisbury. _Gnetopsis_ has also been discovered by Mr Hemingway in the\r\nMiddle Coal Measures of England[845] (fig. 494, H).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gnetopsis elliptica_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this species, slightly oval in section, occur in groups of\r\n2–4 in a cupular investment (fig. 506, E, p. 359) described by Renault\r\nas an ovary but correlated by Oliver and Salisbury with the cupule\r\nwhich surrounds the single ovule of _Lagenostoma_. The cupule is lined\r\nwith hairs similar to those on the wall of the cupule of _Lagenostoma_.\r\nA characteristic feature of the French seeds is the presence of three\r\nor four long plumes of hairs at the apex (fig. 494, E, F). As seen in\r\nfig. 494, E, a small lagenostome (pollen-chamber) rests on the roof of\r\na broad plinth precisely as in _Conostoma_, and four vascular bundles,\r\ncorresponding to the six bundles in _Conostoma_, pass into the apical\r\ncap of sclerous tissue enclosed by a sarcotesta, _sa_ (fig. 494, E,\r\nG). A ‘tent-pole’ prolongation (fig. 494, E, _t_) occurs at the apex\r\nof the prothallus. Renault described a portion of the integument as\r\nconsisting of lacunar tissue which Oliver and Salisbury homologise with\r\nthe superficial mucilaginous layer of _Conostoma_: this is seen above\r\nthe sclerotesta in the apical region of fig. 494, E, _sa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gnetopsis anglica_ Kidston +MS.+\r\n\r\nThis species (fig. 494, H) is represented by seeds from the Middle Coal\r\nMeasures near Barnsley, Yorkshire, 4 mm. long with apical appendages\r\nat least 2·2 cm. in length and probably four in number. The appendages\r\ndo not show the hairs which form a prominent feature in the French\r\nspecimens, but this is probably the result of imperfect preservation:\r\nthere are indications of hairs on other specimens in Dr Kidston’s\r\nCollection. The type-specimen, in Dr Kidston’s Collection, was\r\ngenerously lent to me for examination.\r\n\r\n_Gnetopsis_, while agreeing with _Conostoma_ in the more important\r\nfeatures, is distinguished by the apical plumes, the very slight\r\ndevelopment of a tent-pole prolongation of the nucellar apex (fig. 494,\r\nE, _t_), the smaller number of vascular bundles, and by the presence of\r\nan enclosing cupule (fig. 506, E). In its slight departure from radial\r\nsymmetry _Gnetopsis_ forms a transition between the Radiospermeae and\r\nthe Platyspermeae. It is undoubtedly the seed of a Pteridosperm, but\r\nnothing is known as to the nature of the vegetative organs of the\r\nparent-plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. +Trigonocarpales.+\r\n\r\nIn this group are included radially symmetrical seeds for the most\r\npart belonging to members of the Medulloseae. The peripheral zone of\r\nthe nucellus is supplied with vascular tissue and the nucellus is\r\nfree within the integument except at the base; it is superior and not\r\nsemi-inferior[846] as in recent Cycads and in Lagenostomales. The ovule\r\nof _Myrica Gale_, in which the nucellus stands free within the single\r\nintegument, affords an interesting parallel to seeds of this class in\r\ncontrast to the usual Angiospermous type with a laterally coalescent\r\nnucellus. In _Myrica Gale_[847] the vascular supply is confined to\r\nthe integument. There is a comparatively broad pollen-chamber and in\r\nsome types the lateral tissue of the nucellus is prolonged as a tube\r\nwithin the micropyle. The usually ribbed testa is differentiated into\r\nan outer flesh (sarcotesta), a sclerotesta, and probably in most cases\r\nan endotesta or inner flesh. The ribs of the sclerotesta are in the\r\nmajority of genera in multiples of three and in position correspond to\r\nthe outer ring of vascular bundles. The presence of lacunar tissue in\r\nthe sarcotesta of several genera may be correlated with dispersal by\r\nwater. The apical region of the integument is not lobed but extends as\r\na longer or shorter micropylar tube above the summit of the nucellus.\r\nIn the differentiation of the testa, the form of the pollen-chamber,\r\nand in some other features, the seeds of this group present a general\r\nagreement with those of recent Cycads.\r\n\r\nThe microspores are multicellular and larger than those of the\r\nLagenostomales: in _Stephanospermum akenioides_ they measure 160μ ×\r\n100μ[848] while in _Aetheotesta_[849] they reach 360μ × 290μ.\r\n\r\nGenera. _Trigonocarpus_; _Tripterospermum_; _Ptychotesta_;\r\n_Hexapterospermum_; _Polypterospermum_; _Pachytesta_;\r\n_Stephanospermum_; _Polylophospermum_; _Codonospermum_; _Aetheotesta_;\r\n_Eriotesta_; _Gaudrya_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trigonocarpus.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nA description of the morphological features of _Trigonocarpus\r\nParkinsoni_ and _T. shorensis_ is given in the chapter on _Medullosa_\r\n(p. 117), as there is good evidence that they are the seeds of that\r\ngenus. There is considerable difference in size and to some extent\r\nin the form of casts included in _Trigonocarpus_ and, in the absence\r\nof anatomical data, it is hardly possible to determine the actual\r\nsystematic position of many of the specimens so named. Dr Arber[850]\r\nhas recently proposed a new generic name _Schizospermum_ for casts\r\nvery like those of _T. Parkinsoni_, but distinguished by the splitting\r\nof the shell into three valves, a character which leads him to\r\nconclude that it is the external surface which is preserved and not\r\na mere cast of the seed-cavity. It is, however, more probable that\r\nthe specimens are casts of a split sclerotesta. In _Trigonocarpus\r\npusillus_[851] the shell is divided into three valves, the dividing\r\nlines being marked by greatly reduced ribs, and in _T. schizocarpoides_\r\nGrand’Eury[852], a species that may not be a true _Trigonocarpus_,\r\nthere is also evidence of splitting. Arber points out that the species\r\n_Rhabdocarpus Boschianus_ Berg. is founded on a _Trigonocarpus_\r\nfrom which the outer flesh has disappeared leaving the shell as the\r\nexternal covering. _Trigonocarpus_ seeds are widely distributed in\r\nCarboniferous and Permian rocks in Europe and North America: from the\r\nlatter continent Newberry[853] has described several different forms\r\nthat afford good examples of the abundance and variety of the genus.\r\nSome of the specimens included by Newberry[854] in _Trigonocarpus_\r\nare probably distinct generic types: his species _T. multicarinatus_\r\nmay be identical with the ribbed cast shown in fig. 506, A. The\r\ncasts described by Lindley and Hutton and by other authors as _T.\r\nDawesi_[855] are nearly 5 cm. long, and if these are correctly included\r\nin the genus they point to the occurrence of seeds much larger than\r\nthe type-species. The French species _Trigonocarpus pusillus_[856]\r\nBrongn., one of the smallest Palaeozoic seeds, from 6·5 to 15 mm. long,\r\ndiffers from _Trigonocarpus Parkinsoni_ and _T. shorensis_ in the\r\nabsence of prominent ribs and in the much feebler development of the\r\nsarcotesta. Specimens of the German type _T. sporites_ Weiss, believed\r\nby some authors to be megaspores, were described by Zeiller[857] from\r\nValenciennes as seeds: these are from 2·5 to 3·5 mm. long and have\r\nthree small ribs. Zeiller quotes the presence of cell-outlines on the\r\nsurface as evidence of their seed-nature, but it may be that this\r\nfeature represents a sculpturing of the exine of a spore. Typical\r\n_Trigonocarpus_ seeds agree in several morphological characters with\r\nthose of recent Cycads. They differ in the lack of a lateral union\r\nbetween nucellus and integument; the presence of nucellar tracheids,\r\nthough a feature shared with _Bowenia_, distinguishes them from the\r\nmajority of recent Cycadean seeds. In the comparatively long and fleshy\r\nmicropylar tube a seed of _Encephalartos Lehmanni_ presents a fairly\r\nclose resemblance to a _Trigonocarpus_. Salisbury has pointed out that\r\nthe three species _T. Parkinsoni_, _T. shorensis_, _T. pusillus_ form\r\na consecutive series illustrating the gradual disappearance of the\r\nsecondary ribs that form a prominent feature in _T. Parkinsoni_; but\r\nfor a comparison of these with other types of fossil and recent seeds\r\nthe reader is referred to Salisbury’s summary[858].\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tripterospermum.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe seed on which this genus was founded by Brongniart[859] is clearly\r\nvery closely related to _Trigonocarpus_ and, as Oliver[860] says,\r\nthe distinguishing character described by the author of the genus is\r\nunimportant. Brongniart describes the type species, _T. rostratum_,\r\nas characterised by the presence of three prominent wings composed of\r\na testa differentiated into an inner hard tissue and an outer lacunar\r\ntissue. It is, however, hardly possible to say whether the outer soft\r\ntissue was originally flattened in the form of ‘wings’ or pressed down\r\non to the harder shell. Renault[861] notes the association of seeds\r\nthat he refers to this genus with the leaves of _Dorycordaites_, but\r\napart from the improbability of any connexion between _Tripterospermum_\r\nand _Cordaites_, Renault’s seeds are too imperfect to demonstrate\r\ntheir identity with Brongniart’s genus. Kidston[862] has described an\r\nimpression of a three-winged seed from the coal-field of Staffordshire\r\nas _Tripterospermum ellipticum_, a form described on page 357 as\r\n_Polypterocarpus anglicus_ (fig. 496, B).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ptychotesta.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe type-species of this genus[863], _Ptychotesta tenuis_[864], about\r\n3 cm. long, is characterised by six very prominent flanges or wings\r\nformed by the fissured or folded sclerotesta (fig. 495, B). There is no\r\ninformation as to the vascular supply or other anatomical details. It\r\nis not at all improbable that there is no real distinction between this\r\ngenus and Brongniart’s genus _Hexapterospermum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hexapterospermum.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nIn this genus Brongniart[865] included two species, _Hexapterospermum\r\nstenopterum_ and _H. pachypterum_: the shell is hexagonal in\r\ntransverse section, each angle being prolonged as a narrow flange.\r\nIn one of the sections figured by Brongniart (fig. 495, E) the\r\nribs are not fissured: this is said to be a feature distinguishing\r\n_Hexapterospermum_ from _Ptychotesta_, but the occurrence of a\r\nfissured rib in another section suggests that in the structure of\r\nthe ribs there is no essential difference between the two genera.\r\nIn _Ptychotesta pachypterum_ the testa is prolonged at the chalazal\r\nend as in _Polylophospermum_, and it is possible that there is\r\nno generic difference. Williamson described a cast from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Lancashire as _Hexapterospermum_ [= _Hexagonocarpus_]\r\n_Noegerrathi_[866] (fig. 506, H), but in the absence of anatomical\r\ncharacters it is preferable to avoid the use of Brongniart’s term and\r\nto assign them to Renault’s genus _Hexagonocarpus_[867]. Similarly\r\nthe seeds referred by Dr P. Bertrand[868] to _Hexapterospermum_ may\r\nappropriately be included in the genus _Hexagonocarpus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 495.

Without further anatomical details it\r\nis hardly possible to say whether or not the species represents a\r\nwell-defined generic type, but it is not improbable that a fuller\r\nknowledge would confirm Brongniart’s institution of a new generic\r\ndesignation. The seeds described by Arber[870] and Kidston[871]\r\nrespectively as _Radiospermum ornatum_ and _Polypterospermum ornatum_\r\nare transferred to _Polygonocarpus_ on the ground that they afford no\r\nevidence of anatomical characters of the _Polypterospermum_ type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pachytesta.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[872] established this genus for some unusually large seeds\r\n(fig. 496, A) from the Coal Measures of France reaching a length of\r\n11–12 cm. and resembling in form and size a hen’s egg. Petrified\r\nexamples have been described by Brongniart and Renault[873], and\r\nOliver[874] has given a lucid statement of the more interesting\r\nfeatures of this Permo-Carboniferous genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pachytesta gigantea_ (Grand’Eury).\r\n\r\nIn the separation of nucellus and integument _Pachytesta_ agrees with\r\n_Stephanospermum_ and _Trigonocarpus_. There is a double series of\r\nvascular bundles in the outer part of the testa or exotesta (fig. 497,\r\n_ex_) consisting of a spongy tissue bounded externally and internally\r\nby sclerotic layers: the exotesta is succeeded by a broader endotesta\r\nof spongy consistency which Renault suggested may have served as\r\na floating mechanism, and this is intimately associated with the\r\nnucellus by means of grooves engaging with short ridges (fig. 497,\r\n_nr_) on the surface of the nucellar tissue. The exotesta is divided\r\ninto three valves by radial extensions of the sclerotic tissue (_b_,\r\n_c_, fig. 497; at _a_ the exotesta is shown in an unsplit condition).\r\nIn connexion with each radial plate are two curved plates of fibrous\r\ntissue which extend towards the grooves in the endotesta (fig. 497,\r\n_t_): as Oliver suggests, these plates may have served a mechanical\r\npurpose for the support of the bulky nucellus. The peripheral region\r\nof the nucellus is supplied by several vascular bundles (fig. 497,\r\n_n_) from the tracheal chalazal disc. The exotesta is regarded by\r\nOliver as corresponding to the sarcotesta and sclerotesta of other\r\nseeds, and the grooves in the endotesta interlocking with the nucellar\r\nridges are compared with the interlocking of nucellus and canopy in\r\n_Lagenostoma_, as also with the ruminated endosperm of _Torreya_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 496. A, _Pachytesta incrassata_. B,\r\n_Polypterocarpus anglicus_. (A, after Renault; B, after Kidston.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 497. _Pachytesta_. Transverse section of a seed\r\nshowing the exotesta, _ex_, with sclerous layers and vascular strands\r\n(black), the endotesta (dotted), the nucellus with its ring of vascular\r\nbundles, _n_, and the prothallus, _p_. The three radial plates in the\r\nexotesta are seen at _a_, _b_, _c_, with the trabeculae, _t_, and\r\ninternal to these are the grooves in the endotesta engaging with ribs\r\non the nucellus, _nr_. (After Oliver.)]\r\n\r\nWe have no definite information as to the plants which bore\r\n_Pachytesta_, but it is probable that they were members of the\r\nMedulloseae. Grand’Eury[875] believes _Pachytesta_ to be the seed of\r\n_Alethopteris Grandini_, though this view requires confirmation. This\r\nauthor figures several _Pachytesta_ seeds attached in two oblique rows\r\nto a comparatively slender axis which may be the rachis of a large\r\ncompound frond[876]. Renault and Zeiller[877] have figured specimens\r\nof _P. gigantea_ and _P. incrassata_ from Commentry which afford a\r\ngood idea of the form of these large seeds; the genus is recorded also\r\nfrom Gard, Blanzy[878], and other localities. Kidston[879] described a\r\nlarge oval seed, blunt at each end, from the Middle Coal Measures of\r\nLancashire as _Carpolithus Wildii_ which he thinks may be allied to\r\n_Pachytesta_, but adds, ‘I do not think we are justified in placing\r\nmere impressions of plants in genera, whose distinctive characters are\r\nderived from their internal organisation, unless there is conclusive\r\nevidence to show their identity.’ On this specimen Arber[880] has\r\nfounded a new genus _Megalospermum_, but as the type-specimen shows\r\nno distinctive features other than large dimensions it would seem\r\npreferable to retain the more general designation _Carpolithus_[881].\r\n\r\nAnother example of a seed that may be generically identical with\r\n_Pachytesta_ is that described by Lesquereux from North American Coal\r\nMeasures as _Rhabdocarpus Mansfieldi_ and more recently recorded by\r\nWhite from Missouri as _Rhabdocarpus (Pachytesta) Mansfieldi_[882].\r\nThere is little doubt that this and other species of seeds preserved\r\nas impressions are examples of _Pachytesta_ but, as Kidston says, it\r\nis preferable to reserve the name for specimens showing anatomical\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stephanospermum.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Stephanospermum_, founded by Brongniart[883] on petrified\r\nspecimens from French Stephanian beds, affords a good example of\r\na radiospermic seed without ribs differing in certain well-marked\r\ncharacters from such seeds as _Lagenostoma_, _Physostoma_, and\r\n_Conostoma_, notably in the complete separation of the nucellus from\r\nthe integument and in the possession of a nucellar vascular system. The\r\ndescriptions by Brongniart and Renault[884] have been extended by the\r\nthorough investigations of Oliver[885].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stephanospermum akenioides_ Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThis species is represented by ellipsoidal seeds, 10 mm. long with\r\na maximum breadth of 4–4·5 mm., circular in transverse section.\r\nThe integument consists of a thick sclerotesta lined internally by\r\na thinner soft layer, the endotesta (fig. 494, A, _sc_, _e_), and\r\nin all probability covered by an outer flesh or sarcotesta as in\r\n_Trigonocarpus_, though this tissue is not preserved and is omitted\r\nfrom the section shown in fig. 494, A. The sclerotesta is composed\r\nof a broad outer band of thick-walled palisade cells—the contracted\r\ncontents of which are a striking feature in the silicified seeds (fig.\r\n493, F); these are succeeded by an inner zone of longitudinal fibres.\r\nIn the structure of the palisade-layer _Stephanospermum_ bears a close\r\nresemblance to the sporocarp wall of _Pilularia_[886]. In the apical\r\nregion the shell forms a circular ridge surrounding a peri-micropylar\r\ntrough, a character expressed by the term ‘crown-seed[887]’ employed\r\nby Grand’Eury: the trough sometimes contains partially destroyed\r\ntissue that may be a remnant of a sarcotesta. A _Stephanospermum_\r\nseed, with its apical core and surrounding depression with remnants\r\nof some partially destroyed tissue, may be compared with a fruit of\r\n_Attolia speciosa_ (Palmae) in which a tuft of fibrous tissue picked\r\nout by decay from the mesocarp surmounts the conically pointed apex\r\nof the harder interior of the fruit-wall. The base of the sclerotesta\r\nis perforated by a vascular strand which expands into a tracheal\r\ndisc, _td_, fig. 494, A, at the base of the megaspore from which a\r\ncontinuous mantle 2–3 cells broad, of short spiral and scalariform\r\ntracheids (fig. 493, G), spreads over the whole of the nucellus\r\nimmediately below the nucellar epidermis as far as the lower part of\r\nthe sides of the pollen-chamber: this mantle forms the floor of the\r\nlarge domical pollen-chamber excavated out of the nucellar cone (fig.\r\n494, A, _pc_). The fact that in sections of older seeds the tracheal\r\nfloor shows signs of splitting and disorganisation led Oliver to\r\nconclude that in the living seed the tracheids underwent a gradual\r\ndisintegration prior to fertilisation, thus allowing the passage of\r\nthe antherozoids to the egg-cells (fig. 494, A, _a_). The presence of\r\na continuous tracheal sheath instead of separate vascular bundles is a\r\nspecial feature in which _Stephanospermum_ differs from _Trigonocarpus_\r\nand other Palaeozoic seeds as well as from those of recent Cycads;\r\nas Oliver suggests, ‘the apparent perfection of the vascular\r\nmantle in _Stephanospermum_ may have proved an obstacle to further\r\ndevelopment[888]’ and was not retained by the more successful types. In\r\nits tracheal sheath _Stephanospermum_ resembles the seeds of _Ginkgo_.\r\nThe nucellar cone is prolonged as a beak into the micropyle formed by\r\nthe tubular integument. The megaspore occupies the central portion\r\nof the seed and in the course of its development it compressed the\r\nmegasporangium (nucellus) to such an extent that little more than the\r\nepidermis remains: there is a definite megaspore-membrane surrounding\r\nthe prothallus-tissue in which there were probably two archegonia (fig.\r\n494, A, _a_)[889]. The nucellus stands free within the integument from\r\nwhich it is separated by a space (_s_, fig. 494, A). Microspores are\r\nfrequently met with in the pollen-chamber in which they matured after\r\ntheir introduction through the micropyle, probably with the aid of a\r\ndrop of mucilage: they are large oval bodies with an average size of\r\n160μ × 100μ, some reaching over 200μ, in length and, as Renault was\r\nthe first to point out, within a finely granulate exospore there are\r\nseveral thin-walled cells: this statement was not accepted by some\r\nauthors but Prof. Oliver’s researches have amply confirmed it, and an\r\nexamination of the original preparations convinced me that Renault had\r\ncorrectly described the structural features. Oliver shows that there\r\nare about 20 cells within each microspore regularly arranged as rows\r\nof five wedge-shaped elements with their pointed ends directed towards\r\nthe centre, and he thinks that these cells may have undergone further\r\ndivision to produce sperm-mother-cells, though there is not such good\r\nevidence of this as in the differently constituted microspores of\r\n_Stephanospermum caryoides_. No trace of pollen-tubes was found and it\r\nis probable that the antherozoids were liberated by the rupture of the\r\ndelicate prothallus-tissue. The tracheal sheath afforded an adequate\r\nmeans of water-supply to the pollen-chamber and this enabled the motile\r\nantherozoids to reach the archegonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stephanospermum caryoides_ Oliver[890].\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on a specimen from ., is a larger seed (15·5 ×\r\n12·5 mm.) and more globular than _S. akenioides_; there is a shorter\r\nmicropylar beak and a less developed peri-micropylar trough. As in _S.\r\nakenioides_ the nucellus is free from the base and the two species\r\nconform to the same general type of construction. The microspores are\r\ndistinguished by the presence of only two internal cells which do not\r\noccupy the whole of the spore-cavity but are surrounded by a large\r\nperipheral cell comparable with the tube-cell in recent microspores,\r\nthough there is no proof that a tube was formed: in the case of _S.\r\nakenioides_ Oliver considers that fertilisation was not assisted by\r\nthe production of a pollen-tube. The two cells by further division\r\ngave rise to a secondary cell-complex consisting of at least eight\r\nantherozoid-mother-cells. No antherozoids have been found in the\r\nmicrospores but it is possible that two small bodies, 17μ × 15μ, met\r\nwith in a pollen-chamber may represent the nuclei of sperms. Their\r\nsmall size differentiates them from the much larger male gametes of\r\nCycads and from the supposed sperms of _Physostoma_ and _Lagenostoma_.\r\n\r\nWe have no proof as to the nature of the plant which bore seeds of the\r\n_Stephanospermum_ type, but it is significant that the specimens occur\r\nin close association with fragments of _Alethopteris_ and _Myeloxylon_,\r\na circumstance that favours the view, based on the resemblance of these\r\nseeds to _Trigonocarpus_, that _Stephanospermum_ is the seed of a\r\nmember of the Medulloseae.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polylophospermum[891].= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe type-species _Polylophospermum stephanense_ Brongn.[892],\r\nfounded on partially preserved material from Grand’ Croix, is a\r\nnarrow hexagonal seed 15 mm. long. Additional facts as to the\r\nstructural features have been contributed by Oliver[893]. The testa\r\nis differentiated into an inner shell (sclerotesta) and an outer\r\nflesh (_sa_, fig. 495, C, D): the sclerotesta has six prominent,\r\nfissured, ribs, one at each angle, and between these are six solid and\r\nless prominent secondary ribs. Oliver states that there is an outer\r\nseries of vascular bundles in the sarcotesta, one bundle immediately\r\nexternal to each secondary rib (fig. 495, C, _v_). In the presence\r\nof two kinds of ribs and in the relation of ribs to tracheal strands\r\n_Polylophospermum_ agrees with _Trigonocarpus Parkinsoni_. Strands of\r\nshort tracheids supply the peripheral region of the nucellus and, as in\r\n_Stephanospermum_, reticulate elements extend as far as the floor of\r\nthe large pollen-chamber. There was probably no lateral union between\r\nnucellus and integument. A striking feature is the prolongation of the\r\ntesta at each end of the seed to form an open chamber surrounding the\r\nmicropylar beak and the seed-base (fig. 495, D, _s_, _s_): the apical\r\nchamber, though relatively more prominent, is comparable with that in\r\n_Stephanospermum_, while the basal chamber recalls that in the seed\r\nnamed by Scott and Maslen _Trigonocarpus Oliveri_[894] but subsequently\r\nremoved by Salisbury[895] from that genus. There is no evidence as to\r\nthe parent-plant of _Polylophospermum_, but it may be assumed to have\r\nbeen a Pteridosperm, probably one of the Medulloseae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 498.

(After Renault.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Codonospermum[896].= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of this peculiar genus is derived from Brongniart’s\r\ndescription of the type-species _Codonospermum anomalum_[897]\r\n(fig. 506, B, C) from St Étienne and from Renault’s account of _C.\r\nolivaeforme_[898]. The seeds are globular or ellipsoidal and reach a\r\nlength of 2 cm.: the testa is differentiated into an outer flesh and a\r\nsclerotesta and has usually eight ribs. The most striking feature is\r\nthe division of the seed into two regions, an upper portion containing\r\nthe nucellus and megaspore and a lower portion in the form of an\r\nempty chamber that probably served as a float (fig. 498, A, _s_).\r\nExternally the upper half or seed-proper forms a depressed cupola with\r\neight slightly developed ribs, separated by a circular transverse\r\nconstriction from the basal chamber (fig. 498, B). There is a fairly\r\nlarge pollen-chamber, _pc_, in which Renault found multicellular\r\nmicrospores in _C. olivaeforme_. In _C. anomalum_ 16 vascular bundles\r\n(fig. 498, B, _v_) surround the central region of the seed probably\r\nin the peripheral tissue of the nucellus; these bundles unite in the\r\nchalazal region to form a strand that passes up the centre of the empty\r\nchamber. In _C. anomalum_ the testa of the lower half has eight ribs\r\nand corresponding with each rib is a strand of fibrous tissue (fig.\r\n498, B, _f_). In _C. olivaeforme_ the testa is thicker than in _C.\r\nanomalum_ and the lower region of the seed is smooth and circular in\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nImpressions of _Codonospermum_ are described[899] from Commentry, from\r\nthe Loire—the Gard district[900], and by Zeiller[901] from Blanzy.\r\nThere is no decisive evidence as to the parent-plant, but some French\r\nauthors[902] regard the frequent association of _Codonospermum_ with\r\nleaves of _Dolerophyllum_ as significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aetheotesta.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\n_Aetheotesta elliptica_ Renault.\r\n\r\nBrongniart instituted the genus _Aetheotesta_[903] for an incomplete\r\nseed (_A. subglobosa_) from Grand’ Croix, and Renault[904] subsequently\r\nfounded the species _A. elliptica_ on much better material. The testa\r\nof the elliptical seed, 3 cm. long, consists of an outer region\r\nvery thin on the flanks but highly developed at the apex and base\r\nwhich forms a sarcotesta characterised in the apical region by large\r\nradially disposed spaces, fig. 498, C, _s_; the sclerotesta, composed\r\nof harder tissue, is prolonged as an apical beak. There is a large\r\npollen-chamber, _pc_, in which Renault found multicellular microspores\r\n(320μ–400μ). In the chalazal region the main vascular supply forms\r\na cup-like investment, _v_, in the basal portion of the nucellus,\r\nand at a higher level this breaks up into several nucellar strands.\r\nRenault thinks that _Aetheotesta_ is the seed of _Dolerophyllum_, but\r\nthere is no proof of any connexion. The presence of large spaces in\r\nthe sarcotesta may be interpreted, as Renault suggests, as evidence of\r\nadaptation to dispersal by water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eriotesta.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[905] instituted this genus[906] on an incomplete transverse\r\nsection of a seed from Grand’ Croix, 8 mm. in diameter, which he called\r\n_Eriotesta velutina_, characterised by a ribbed and probably octagonal\r\ntesta bearing numerous elongated hairs over the whole surface. The\r\nmaterial is, however, too meagre to throw any light on the important\r\nfeatures of the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gaudrya.= Grand’Eury.\r\n\r\n_Gaudrya trivalvis_ Grand’Eury.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Gaudrya_[907] was proposed for two petrified seeds\r\nfrom the Gard coal-field briefly described as _G. trivalvis_, the\r\ntype-species, and _G. lagenaria_. The testa of the former species\r\nshows signs of splitting along three equidistant lines; it consists\r\nof a sarcotesta enclosing an endotesta with six longitudinal ribs:\r\nGrand’Eury speaks of lacunae between the endotesta and nucellus which\r\nhe regards as spaces in a tissue which made the seed buoyant and\r\nfacilitated dispersal by water. It is not clear whether the nucellus\r\nand integument were originally connected or laterally free: the lacunae\r\nmay be the remains of an inner flesh and not spaces in a spongy tissue.\r\nThe genus is radiospermic and characterised by a long micropyle and\r\na broad pollen-chamber. On the available evidence it is difficult to\r\nassign the specimens to their systematic position, but the genus is\r\nprobably a member of the Trigonocarpales.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. +Cardiocarpales.+\r\n\r\nPlatyspermic seeds for the most part belonging to Cordaitalean plants\r\nand agreeing in their plan of organisation, even more closely than\r\nthe seeds of the Trigonocarpales, with those of recent Cycads. The\r\nnucellus is free laterally from the integument and there is a series of\r\nvascular bundles in the nucellus. The testa consists of an outer flesh,\r\nthe sarcotesta, which may reach a considerable thickness, a shell\r\nor sclerotesta, and in some genera an endotesta. In seeds preserved\r\nas impressions the sarcotesta often gives them a winged appearance\r\n(_Samaropsis_). The pollen-chamber is relatively small, resembling in\r\nthis respect the chamber in recent Cycads. A central prolongation of\r\nthe prothallus-tissue in the form of a blunt column or ‘tent-pole’\r\nis a characteristic feature; the same feature occurs in seeds of the\r\nLagenostomales, but in the Cordaitales it resembles more nearly the\r\n‘tent-pole,’ as it was called by Hirase, in recent Cycadean seeds and\r\nin _Ginkgo_. The presence of two vascular strands in the sarcotesta\r\nin the principal plane of the seeds is a character shared with the\r\nseeds of _Cycas_: the position and course of these bundles are useful\r\ncharacters for distinguishing different types within the group. The\r\nmicrospores are multicellular.\r\n\r\nGenera. _Cardiocarpus_; _Cyclospermum_; _Cycadinocarpus_;\r\n_Rhabdospermum_; _Mitrospermum_; _Diplotesta_; _Leptocaryon_;\r\n_Taxospermum_; _Compsotesta_. These generic names are all used in the\r\nfollowing pages for seeds known to possess certain anatomical features;\r\nthere are also included in the Cardiocarpales the genera _Samaropsis_,\r\n_Cordaicarpus_, and _Rhabdocarpus_, but it is proposed to limit their\r\nuse to specimens which furnish no anatomical data and cannot therefore\r\nbe assigned with equal confidence to a section of seeds based on\r\ndefinite morphological characters. It is certain that some at least of\r\nthe seeds described under these names would, if preserved as petrified\r\nspecimens, be included in one or other of the genera named above.\r\n\r\nThere is ample proof that some of these seeds were borne on Cordaitean\r\nplants and that the group as a whole represents the seeds of the\r\nCordaitales[908]. It is, however, certain that some Platyspermic\r\nseeds were produced by Pteridosperms. No little confusion has been\r\ncaused by the employment of the same generic names for petrified\r\nseeds and for casts and impressions affording no evidence as to\r\nsimilarity in anatomical characters. With a view to avoid the risks\r\nnecessarily entailed by following this practice it is suggested that\r\na clearer distinction should be drawn between genera based primarily\r\non structural features and form-genera. The following notes on the\r\ngenera _Cardiocarpus_, _Cordaicarpus_, _Cyclocarpon_, _Cycadinocarpus_,\r\n_Jordania_, and _Samaropsis_, may serve to illustrate some of the\r\ndifficulties connected with the terminology of Palaeozoic seeds.\r\n\r\n_Cardiocarpus_. Brongniart[909] proposed the name _Cardiocarpon_ in\r\n1828 for Upper Carboniferous seeds described as compressed lenticular,\r\ncordiform or reniform ‘fruits’ with an acute apex: in his later\r\nwork[910] he recognised their true morphological nature and gave an\r\naccount of some exceptionally well-preserved examples from Grand’\r\nCroix. Brongniart in common with other authors believed _Cardiocarpus_\r\nseeds to belong to Cordaitean plants, a view that in several cases is\r\nbased on conclusive evidence. The specimen represented in fig. 501,\r\nD, illustrates the characteristic form of a cast of a _Cardiocarpus_\r\nseed, and the sections shown in fig. 501, A and B, are from an\r\nidentical or a very closely allied species. The generic characters\r\nare: (i) the presence of a narrow flattened border or wing surrounding\r\na platyspermic nucule, (ii) the cordiform base and more or less\r\npointed apex, (iii) the differentiation of the testa into a sarcotesta\r\nand sclerotesta free from the nucellus except at the base, (iv) the\r\n‘tent-pole’ prolongation of the prothallus (fig. 510, A, _b_) and the\r\npresence of a fairly large pollen-chamber, _pc_, (v) the occurrence of\r\ntwo sets of vascular bundles, an inner nucellar series and two double\r\nvascular strands (fig. 500, A, _v_, B) which are given off from the\r\nmain supply before it reaches the sclerotesta. The term _Cardiocarpus_\r\nas used by Brongniart signifies a type of seed possessing both certain\r\nanatomical and external characters. The proposal is to restrict the\r\ngeneric appellation to seeds exhibiting definite structural features\r\nagreeing in essentials with _Cardiocarpus sclerotesta_ and _C.\r\ndrupaceus_.\r\n\r\n_Cordaicarpus_. This name was first employed by Geinitz[911] in the\r\nform _Cordaicarpon_, the type-species being _C. Cordai_ (fig. 502, C)\r\nfrom the Coal Measures of Germany, a seed referred by the author of\r\nthe genus to _Cordaites principalis_ but, as Kidston has pointed out,\r\nthere is evidence that this correlation may be incorrect: there is,\r\nhowever, no doubt as to its Cordaitean parentage. Specimens included\r\nin this genus agree closely with species of _Cardiocarpus_, but they\r\nare usually described as being distinguished by the absence of a flat\r\nborder and by a more rounded and less cordate base. In the example\r\nof _Cordaicarpus Cordai_ shown in fig. 502, C, and in other species\r\nassigned by authors to this genus there is a narrow border and the\r\nform of the base is an inconstant character. As Kidston[912] and other\r\nauthors point out, there are no definite and constant characters by\r\nwhich to distinguish _Cardiocarpus_ from _Cordaicarpus_ as regards the\r\nform of the seeds preserved as casts or impressions. A further account\r\nof _Cordaicarpus_ is given on a later page.\r\n\r\n_Cordaispermum_. This designation was formerly adopted by Renault[913]\r\nfor seeds having the form and anatomical features of _Cardiocarpus_\r\nwhich there is good reason for attributing to _Cordaites_ or to some\r\nallied genus. In view of the fact that the majority of the seeds under\r\nconsideration are undoubtedly Cordaitean there is no need to employ\r\nthis additional generic name.\r\n\r\n_Cyclocarpon_. Fiedler[914] instituted this term for seeds previously\r\ndescribed by Berger as _Cardiocarpon emarginatum_ (fig. 502, B,\r\nnow included in _Samaropsis_) and added a new species _Cyclocarpon\r\nnummularium_. Brongniart[915] subsequently described the structure\r\nof two species, _C. tenue_ and _C. nummulare_, which he referred to\r\nFiedler’s genus, and Bertrand[916] has shown that these differ from\r\nthe genus _Cardiocarpus_ in the recurrent course of the bundles given\r\noff from the chalazal strand as in the genus _Rhabdospermum_ (cf.\r\nfig. 501, E). There are no good grounds for retaining the designation\r\n_Cyclocarpon_ for casts and impressions, as the specimens so named are\r\nindistinguishable from impressions referred to _Cordaicarpus_. The\r\ngeneric name _Cyclocarpus_, retained by Bertrand only for _C. tenuis_\r\nand _C. nummularis_ simply for anatomical reasons, is now altered to\r\n_Cyclospermum_ on the ground that the designation _Cyclocarpon_ has\r\nbeen used for impressions affording no information with regard to\r\nanatomical features.\r\n\r\n_Cycadinocarpus_. Renault[917] transferred to this genus Brongniart’s\r\nspecies _Cardiocarpus augustodunensis_ on the ground that the vascular\r\nsystem exhibits in a greater degree than the other types included\r\nby Brongniart in _Cardiocarpus_ a resemblance to that in recent\r\ncycadean seeds. Bertrand[918] confirms Renault’s account and retains\r\n_Cycadinocarpus augustodunensis_ as a species worthy of generic\r\ndistinction. A short account of this seed is given on a later page.\r\n\r\n_Jordania_. This name was given by Fiedler[919] to compressed\r\novate-cordate seeds characterised by a broad membranous border bearing\r\na superficial resemblance to the seeds of _Bignonia_. The type-species,\r\n_J. bignoniodes_ (fig. 502, I), from the Coal Measures of Saarbrücken\r\nhas the form usually associated with the designation _Samaropsis_,\r\nand as the latter term is generally adopted there are no adequate\r\nreasons for the retention of _Jordania_. The name _Jordania_ has also\r\nbeen applied, by Schenk[920], to fossil Dicotyledonous wood and was\r\npreviously used by Boissier[921].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 499. _Samaropsis emarginata_, from the\r\nWestphalian series, Yorkshire. (Kidston Coll., 4227; × 2.)]\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis_. Goeppert[922] defined _Samaropsis_ as ‘Fructus\r\nsamaroideus membranaceus, compressus, margine alatus, monospermus.’ The\r\ntype-species, _S. ulmiformis_, from the Permian of Brenau, is a small\r\nseed with a broad wing or border, but a better example of _Samaropsis_\r\nis figured by Goeppert as the wing of an insect[923]. Examples of\r\nthe genus are shown in figs. 502, A–H; 503; 504. Seeds included in\r\n_Samaropsis_ differ from those referred to _Cordaicarpus_ in the\r\npresence of a broader and more clearly defined border which in some\r\ncases, as in the genus _Mitrospermum_ (fig. 494, K, L), undoubtedly\r\nrepresents a lateral wing-like extension of the sarcotesta. In some\r\ninstances the wing may be a tangentially expanded integument comparable\r\nwith the perianth of _Welwitschia_, and in some Jurassic seeds referred\r\nby Heer[924] to _Samaropsis_ the lateral appendages are probably true\r\nwings. It is advisable to restrict the designation _Samaropsis_\r\nto Palaeozoic seeds. Nucules deprived of the broad border would be\r\nreferred to _Cordaicarpus_ as usually employed for impressions. The\r\ngeneric name _Samaropsis_ serves a useful purpose as a distinctive term\r\nfor platyspermic seeds preserved as casts or impressions characterised\r\nby the possession of a wide border or wing broader than in typical\r\nexamples of _Cordaicarpus_. The specimen represented in fig. 499\r\naffords a good illustration of the difference between _Samaropsis_ and\r\n_Cordaicarpus_. In this specimen the border clearly consists of two\r\nportions, an inner narrower border (black in the drawing) and an outer\r\nmore delicate portion; the former is the impression of the sclerotesta\r\nand the outer represents the fleshy sarcotesta which in the living seed\r\nmay have formed a wing. If, as often happens, the seed were preserved\r\nwith the narrow border only it would be assigned to _Cordaicarpus_,\r\nmany species of which are undoubtedly incomplete _Samaropsis_ seeds.\r\n\r\nThe seeds described by Lindley and Hutton as _Cardiocarpon acutum_\r\n(fig. 444, p. 171) have been made by Arber[925] the type of a new genus\r\n_Cornucarpus_, the distinguishing feature being the triangular form\r\nand the apical horns of the wing. The seeds figured by Arber[926] from\r\nthe Kent coalfield as _Cornucarpus acutus_ are, however, not identical\r\nwith the type of Lindley and Hutton, which has the characters of\r\n_Samaropsis_. _Samaropsis_ is widely distributed in Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks in Europe and North America and is recorded also from India[927]\r\n(fig. 504), China[928], South Africa[929] (fig. 503), South\r\nAmerica[930] (fig. 502, F, G) and Australia[931]. Some seeds of this\r\nform were certainly borne on Cordaitean plants (cf. fig. 480, A), but\r\nseeds of similar type have been found in organic connexion with the\r\nfoliage of Pteridosperms (figs. 442, 445, pp. 167, 172). The Permian\r\n‘cone-scales’ bearing seeds described by Geinitz as _Cardiocarpon\r\ntriangulare_[932], represented by well preserved impressions in the\r\nDresden Museum, appear to be of the _Samaropsis_ type: the same\r\nauthor referred some _Samaropsis_ seeds to the Conifer _Walchia_, but\r\nWeiss[933] dissents from this correlation as the seeds often occur\r\nin beds in which _Walchia_ is not represented. Renault states that\r\nthe seeds of the fertile shoot described by him as _Cycadospadix\r\nMilleryensis_[934] from Autun [= _Strobilites Milleryensis_ (Ren.)]\r\nclosely resemble _Samaropsis fluitans_ Daws. as figured by Weiss. The\r\nsuggestion by White[935] that _Samaropsis_ seeds were borne on fertile\r\nleaves of _Gangamopteris_ adds a further difficulty to the use of the\r\ngeneric characters of _Samaropsis_ as criteria of systematic position.\r\nThe Permian seeds figured by Goeppert[936] as _Oreodoxites Martianus_\r\nare possibly specimens of _Samaropsis_.\r\n\r\nThe designation _Samaropsis_, though usually restricted to Palaeozoic\r\nspecies, is applied by some authors to ‘winged’ seeds from Mesozoic\r\nstrata; but as some of the Jurassic seeds[937] so named appear to have\r\ntrue wings like those of some recent Conifers it is advisable to adhere\r\nto the more limited use of the name.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assert that many _Samaropsis_ seeds agreed generally\r\nin structure with Cordaitean seeds such as the petrified examples\r\ndescribed by Brongniart as _Cardiocarpus_. The species _Mitrospermum\r\ncompressum_[938] is an example of a petrified seed having the external\r\nfeatures of _Samaropsis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cardiocarpus.=\r\n\r\nThis generic title I propose to restrict to petrified seeds exhibiting\r\nthe characters described by Brongniart[939] and more recently by\r\nBertrand[940] in _C. sclerotesta_ and _C. drupaceus_. In general\r\norganisation seeds of this generic type agree with those of recent\r\nCycads and with the seed of _Ginkgo biloba_, but there are certain\r\ndistinguishing features. An important character is afforded by the\r\ncourse and place of origin of the lower vascular strands from the main\r\nsupply at the base of the seed. The outer vascular system consists\r\nof two bundles given off from the main strand, before it reaches\r\nthe sclerotesta, which pass up the sarcotesta (fig. 500, B). In\r\n_Rhabdospermum_, on the other hand, the corresponding bundles arise\r\nat a higher level and form recurrent strands which penetrate the\r\nsclerotesta before passing up the fleshy part of the integument (cf.\r\nfig. 501, E).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 500. _Cardiocarpus drupaceus_ var. _expansus_.\r\nA, transverse section of the testa approximately in the middle of the\r\nseed; _v_, vascular bundles. B, diagrammatic sketch, adapted from\r\nBrongniart’s drawing of the base of the seed showing the sarcotesta,\r\n_sa_, the sclerotesta, _sc_, and the pad of vascular tissue, _d_, at\r\nthe base of the nucellus. (After Brongniart.)]\r\n\r\n_Cardiocarpus sclerotesta_ Brongniart. The testa is differentiated into\r\nan inner shell and an outer sarcotesta (fig. 501, A; the sclerotesta\r\nis shown in black); there is a well developed pollen-chamber (_pc_)\r\nand below this the prothallus-tissue is prolonged as a blunt and short\r\ntent-pole, _b_, as in _Gingko_ and in several fossil seeds. On each\r\nside of the apical tent-pole the slightly shrunken prothallus shows two\r\nsmall archegonia, _a_, which in the relatively small size and spherical\r\nform of the egg-cells resemble those of _Ginkgo_. In transverse section\r\n(fig. 501, B) the seed is bi-convex and at each end of the major axis\r\nthe sclerotesta forms a small keel. There are two sets of vascular\r\nbundles concerned in the supply of material to the ovule; a lower pair\r\nof bundles given off from the central strand in the sarcotesta (fig.\r\n500, B) which pass to the apical region in the inner tissues of the\r\nsarcotesta in the principal plane (fig. 500, A, _v_), and an inner set\r\nof bundles that pass up the peripheral tissue of the nucellus.\r\n\r\nThe species described by Brongniart as _Cardiocarpus (Cyclocarpus)\r\ntenuis_ and _C. nummularis_ have been removed by Bertrand[941] from\r\n_Cardiocarpus_ on the ground that the integumental bundles pursue a\r\ncourse like that in _Rhabdospermum_; it is now referred to the new\r\ngenus _Cyclospermum_[942].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 501.

(= _Cyclocarpus_ Bertrand).\r\n\r\nAs stated on a previous page Bertrand[943] re-establishes the\r\ngeneric name _Cyclocarpus_, founded on impressions without reference\r\nto anatomical characters, for two petrified seeds from St Étienne\r\ndescribed by Brongniart as _Cardiocarpus tenuis_ and _Cyclocarpus\r\nnummularis_[944]. These types differ from _Rhabdospermum_ in the\r\nabsence of an apical snout but agree with that genus in the steeply\r\ndescending course of the vascular strands in the basal region of the\r\nseed. As stated on a previous page, the name _Cyclospermum_ is proposed\r\nas a substitute for _Cyclocarpus_ because of the employment of the\r\nlatter term for impressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cycadinocarpus.= Schimper[945].\r\n\r\n_Cycadinocarpus augustudunensis_ (Brongniart[946]). In the possession\r\nof two sets of vascular bundles this type agrees with _Cardiocarpus_,\r\nbut the more internal strands pass up on the inner face of the\r\nsclerotesta without penetrating into the nucellus, a feature in which\r\n_Cycadinocarpus_ agrees with the majority of recent cycadean seeds: the\r\nouter bundles are given off from the main supply after it has entered\r\nthe sclerotesta and not before as in _Cardiocarpus_; they follow an\r\noblique course in the sclerotesta and emerge into the sarcotesta at\r\nthe shoulders of the basal curve of the seed. As in _Cardiocarpus_ and\r\n_Rhabdospermum_ the two outer bundles lie in the principal plane of\r\nthe seed. There is a pollen-chamber at the apex of the nucellus and\r\nthe latter tissue is prolonged as a tent-pole which engages with the\r\nmicropyle. In the absence of data as to the course of the vascular\r\nbundles in the chalazal region it would not be possible to distinguish\r\nbetween this genus and _Cardiocarpus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhabdocarpus= Berger and =Rhabdospermum= gen. nov.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to restrict the name _Rhabdocarpus_[947] to impressions\r\nand casts of seeds of the type represented by _R. tunicatus_ as figured\r\nby Berger[948] and reproduced in fig. 506, K, the term _Rhabdospermum_\r\nbeing applied to seeds of similar form in which are shown certain\r\ndistinguishing anatomical features. _Rhabdocarpus tunicatus_ Berger\r\nis a species founded on a specimen from the Coal Measures of Silesia\r\ncharacterised by an outer carbonised testa prolonged apically as a\r\nblunt snout and, as seen in fig. 506, K, covering an apparently ribbed\r\nnucule, but the ‘ribs’ are due to the presence of fibrous strands and\r\nare not ribs in the ordinary sense. The outer tissue shows numerous\r\nlongitudinal striations due presumably to the presence of fibrous\r\nelements in the sarcotesta like those shown in the petrified seed\r\nrepresented in fig. 501, C. The genus is defined by Berger as follows:\r\n‘Semina ovata vel elliptico-oblonga secundum longitudinem parallele\r\nnervosa vel tenuissime striata, putamine (interdum deficiente)\r\ninstructa.’ As used by Berger and many other authors _Rhabdocarpus_\r\nincludes a miscellaneous collection of seeds often differing widely\r\nfrom the type-species. Many of the examples correctly referred to\r\nBerger’s genus are platyspermic though a bilateral symmetry is by no\r\nmeans always clear. Renault and Zeiller[949] in their definition of\r\n_Rhabdocarpus_ include bilateral symmetry as a characteristic feature\r\nand speak of the seeds as oblong or oval with a pointed or truncate\r\napex and a rounded base. Impressions of _Rhabdocarpus_ differ from\r\nthose of _Cardiocarpus_ or _Cordaicarpus_ in their more elongate\r\nform, always longer than broad, and in the absence of a basal sinus.\r\nThe seeds found attached to _Neuropteris_ pinnae and, in external\r\nfeatures, agreeing with many specimens included in Berger’s genus, have\r\nbeen transferred by P. Bertrand[950] and Arber[951] to a new genus\r\n_Neurospermum_[952]. Arber[953] in his recent revision of British seeds\r\nproposes to restrict the name _Rhabdocarpus_ to platyspermic seeds\r\nhaving a ‘large unsymmetrical nucule enclosed in a large unsymmetrical\r\nwing or sarcotesta,’ that is to forms symmetrical in one plane. In\r\nthis category he includes _Rhabdocarpus tunicatus_ Berg. (fig. 506,\r\nK) and _R. subtunicatus_[954] Grand’Eury, but it is not clear on what\r\ngrounds Berger’s species is spoken of as symmetrical in only one\r\nplane: in the species _R. Lilleanus_ Arb.[955] the symmetry is hardly\r\nsufficiently well defined to rank as a generic character. In the case\r\nof the _Neuropteris_ seeds the apical snout is slightly curved, thus\r\ngiving them an unsymmetrical appearance (cf. fig. 422, p. 114). The\r\nCarboniferous and Permian seeds usually referred to _Rhabdocarpus_\r\nare transferred by Arber to his genus _Platyspermum_[956], a\r\ndesignation for which it is proposed to substitute Nathorst’s genus\r\n_Holcospermum_[957]. In seeds preserved as more or less flattened\r\nimpressions it is practically impossible in many cases accurately to\r\ndetermine the symmetry: as fig. 506, A, shows, casts indistinguishable\r\nfrom some examples of _Platyspermum_ are radially symmetrical.\r\nBrongniart[958] extended the original definition of _Rhabdocarpus_ to\r\ninclude certain anatomical characters, and these have been more fully\r\ndefined by Bertrand[959]. It is for seeds showing these anatomical\r\nfeatures that the name _Rhabdospermum_ is now proposed. This course is\r\nfollowed on the ground that it is advisable to avoid confusion between\r\npetrified specimens and impressions which in spite of superficial\r\nresemblance may not be closely related. In some cases it is practically\r\ncertain that an impression of the _Rhabdocarpus_ type is generically\r\nidentical with a seed of similar form showing the anatomical structure\r\nof _Rhabdospermum_, but unless identity is established a distinct\r\nterminology is preferable. The use of the generic name _Rhabdospermum_\r\ncarries with it an implication of platyspermy, but under _Rhabdocarpus_\r\nmay be included seeds which are radiospermic and platyspermic. Some\r\nseeds agreeing with _Rhabdospermum_ are referred by Grand’Eury[960]\r\nto _Poroxylon_, and it is probable that _Rhabdospermum_ like\r\n_Cardiocarpus_ is a Cordaitean seed. On the other hand _Rhabdocarpus_\r\nmay well include species, apart from those transferred to\r\n_Neurospermum_, that belong to Pteridosperms. A species, _Rhabdocarpus\r\nOliveri_, recently described by Kidston[961] from the Staffordshire\r\ncoalfield is an example of a radiospermic seed which may be assigned\r\nto a Pteridosperm. The type-specimen is an ovate seed 4 cm. long and 2\r\ncm. broad agreeing in form and surface-features with _Rhabdocarpus_ as\r\nalready defined, but the evidence it affords of internal structure is\r\ninsufficient to determine its position with regard to genera founded on\r\nanatomical characters. Other examples of _Rhabdocarpus_ are described\r\nby Lesquereux[962] and White[963] from American Coal Measures, by\r\nGrand’Eury[964] from the Loire, by Renault[965] from Autun, and by many\r\nother authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhabdospermum.= Gen. nov.\r\n\r\nThe platyspermic seeds included in this genus agree in size and form\r\nwith impressions assigned to _Rhabdocarpus_ and as regards the main\r\nfeatures conform anatomically to _Cardiocarpus_; they were probably\r\nborne on Cordaitean plants. Fig. 501, C, represents a longitudinal\r\nsection of the species _Rhabdospermum cyclocaryon_ described\r\nby Brongniart as _Rhabdocarpus cyclocaryon_: the sarcotesta is\r\nparticularly well developed in the apical region; at the apex a portion\r\nof the micropyle is seen at _m_ and near the nucellus are pieces of\r\nthe sclerotesta shown in black. The presence of anastomosing fibres\r\nnear the surface is a characteristic feature: these, as Bertrand points\r\nout, do not form a hypodermal tissue in the strict sense as they may\r\nbe separated by some of the thin-walled parenchyma of the sarcotesta\r\nfrom the epidermis. The sclerotesta is only partially preserved but the\r\ninner portion forms a dark line enclosing the nucellus, the superficial\r\ntissue of which is separated from the shrunken prothallus represented\r\nby the almost spherical dotted region: the remains of an archegonium\r\nare seen at _a_ (fig. 501, C) and the characteristic tent-pole apex\r\nof the prothallus is shown at _b_. While in shape and in the general\r\nplan of organisation _Rhabdospermum_ agrees with _Cardiocarpus_, the\r\nvascular system in the chalazal region constitutes a distinguishing\r\nfeature. In _Rhabdospermum_ the main vascular strand passes through\r\nthe sclerotesta, _e_, _e′_, fig. 501, E, before giving off two bundles\r\nwhich bend back (‘faisceaux récurrents’), traverse the shell, and then\r\npass up the sarcotesta in correspondence with the feebly developed\r\nlateral keels as far as the micropyle, while in _Cardiocarpus_ (fig.\r\n500, B) the bundles are given off before the main strand reaches the\r\nsclerotesta. Similar recurrent bundles occur also in _Mitrospermum_\r\n(fig. 494, K)[967].\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mitrospermum.= A. Arber.\r\n\r\n_Mitrospermum compressum_ (Williamson). Mrs Arber[968] proposed the\r\nname _Mitrospermum_[969], suggested by the peculiar form of the\r\nseed-base, as a substitute for _Cardiocarpon_ for Williamson’s species\r\n_C. compressum_[970] from the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire. The\r\nseed is platyspermic and there is some evidence that it split into two\r\nvalves along the principal plane (the longer axis of the section, fig.\r\n494, L). The diagrammatic and partially restored longitudinal section\r\nreproduced in fig. 494, K, shows the main features: a sarcotesta, _sa_,\r\ncovers the surface of the testa as a thin layer except at the edges\r\nof the flattened sides where it forms a wing-like border; preserved\r\nas an impression the seed would be assigned to _Samaropsis_. The\r\nsclerotesta, _sc_, has a pointed apex which surrounds the lower third\r\nof the micropyle and a broad base perforated by the chalazal vascular\r\nstrand. There was probably a narrow inner flesh as in _Trigonocarpus_\r\nand recent Cycadean seeds (fig. 494, K, _cf_). The nucellus was free\r\nfrom the integument except at the base, as in _Trigonocarpus_ and\r\n_Stephanospermum_ (fig. 494, K, _n_): internal to the shrivelled\r\nremains of the inner flesh there was a nucellar tapetum surrounding the\r\nmegaspore. Details as to the pollen-chamber are lacking though there\r\nare indications that it resembled that of some species of Cordaitean\r\nseeds. The main vascular supply passes through the sclerotesta and then\r\nforms a low cushion of short reticulate elements below the base of the\r\nnucellus from which two bundles are given off (fig. 494, K, _v_) in the\r\nprincipal plane. The course of the bundles which pierce the sclerotesta\r\nled Mrs Arber to remove this seed from _Cardiocarpus_, as recently\r\ndefined by Bertrand[971], since in that genus the integumental bundles\r\nhave their origin below the sclerotesta. In the course of the vascular\r\nbundles _Mitrospermum_ is intermediate between _Rhabdospermum_ and\r\n_Taxospermum_.\r\n\r\nThis genus is founded on a detached seed, but its resemblance to\r\nundoubted Cordaitean species favours its attribution to that group\r\nthough, as Mrs Arber points out, some markedly platyspermic seeds are\r\nknown to have been borne on fern-like fronds and _Mitrospermum_ may\r\nbelong to some genus of Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diplotesta.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\n_Diplotesta Grand’Euryana_ Brongniart. The generic name _Diplotesta_,\r\nsuggested by Grand’Eury, was given by Brongniart[972] to a Grand’ Croix\r\nseed which he compared with that of the Conifer _Cephalotaxus_. The\r\ntype-specimen is elliptical and platyspermic (fig. 495, H, p. 322),\r\nand differs from _Taxospermum_ in the cordate form of the seed-cavity,\r\nalso in the more restricted union of nucellus and testa. The testa\r\nis differentiated into a sarcotesta (_sa_) and sclerotesta, and the\r\nlatter forms two feebly developed keels in the principal plane: a\r\ncharacteristic feature shared with _Mitrospermum_ is the splitting\r\nof the shell into two equal valves (fig. 495, F). Fig. 495, H, shows\r\nthe contracted cylindrical nucellus and the pollen-chamber: the\r\nsarcotesta (_sa_) is only partially preserved. _Diplotesta_ differs\r\nfrom _Cardiocarpus_ in the course of the integumental vascular bundles\r\nwhich are of the type illustrated by _Rhabdospermum_, _Taxospermum_,\r\nand _Cyclocarpus_, but from these genera it is distinguished by the\r\ndehiscence of the shell, also by its form and certain anatomical\r\nfeatures as described by Brongniart and Bertrand[973].\r\n\r\nIn this genus Bertrand includes Brongniart’s species _Sarcotaxus\r\navellana_ (fig. 495, F), a correlation suggested by the latter author.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leptocaryon.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[974] founded this genus for a single species, _Leptocaryon\r\navellana_, represented by a Grand’ Croix specimen 12 × 10 mm., which\r\nhe believed to be related to _Taxus_. _Leptocaryon_ differs from\r\n_Taxospermum_ in the structure of the testa, but resembles it in\r\nexternal features. Bertrand[975] in his revision and extension of\r\nBrongniart’s account says that the sections throw no light on the\r\nnature of the vascular supply, and it is therefore impossible to form a\r\nsatisfactory opinion as to the relationships of the genus. Renault[976]\r\nreferred this genus to the Cordaitales, but we have no evidence as to\r\nthe parent-plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Taxospermum.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[977] gave this name to a small elliptical seed, 15×9 mm.,\r\nrecalling in external features the seed of _Taxus_, a genus to which\r\nhe believed the Grand’ Croix species to be related. The type-species\r\n_Taxospermum Grüneri_ (fig. 495, G) has a comparatively thin testa\r\ncharacterised by the absence of a sub-chalazal pad formed by the\r\nswelling of the sclerotesta. The nucellus is attached by a broad\r\nbase to the testa and the two regions appear to be connected for\r\na short distance on the flanks[978]; in this feature the seed is\r\ncomparable with that of the Conifer _Torreya_ and differs from the\r\nother platysperms, _Diplotesta_, _Rhabdospermum_, etc. Bertrand[979]\r\nstates that the main vascular strand extends from the hilum to the\r\nchalaza before giving off the two opposite bundles which ‘follow the\r\nfloor of the shell-cavity, and on reaching the flanks traverse the\r\nshell obliquely from below upwards[980].’ In the course and position\r\nof the integumental bundles _Taxospermum_ differs from _Cardiocarpus_,\r\n_Cycadinocarpus_, and _Rhabdospermum_. In this genus Bertrand includes\r\n_Sarcotaxus angulosus_ Brongn. and _S. olivaeformis_ Brongn.[981]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compsotesta.= Bertrand ex Brongniart +MS.+\r\n\r\n_Compsotesta Brongniarti_ Bertrand. The generic name\r\n_Compsotesta_[982], though adopted by Brongniart for some incomplete\r\nspecimens from Grand’ Croix, was not published either by him or\r\nRenault: it has recently been revived by Bertrand[983] in his account\r\nof the anatomical details of Brongniart’s sections. This seed appears\r\nto be closely allied to the polypterous forms _Ptychotesta_ and\r\n_Hexapterospermum_: the testa consists of a sarcotesta differentiated\r\ninto two zones the outer of which contains vascular bundles in\r\ncorrespondence with the ribs, and an inner shell. There is a nucellar\r\nvascular supply and the nucellus is free on the flanks as in\r\n_Stephanospermum_ and _Trigonocarpus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Samaropsis.= Goeppert.\r\n\r\nThe characters of this Permian and Carboniferous genus have already\r\nbeen described: the name has reference only to superficial features\r\nespecially the samara-like ‘wing,’ and connotes no special anatomical\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis fluitans_ (Dawson). The species described by Dawson[984]\r\nas _Cardiocarpum fluitans_ from Carboniferous strata in Nova Scotia,\r\nis represented by oval seeds with a fairly broad border usually\r\nshowing an apical notch. Fig. 502, A, is a copy of Dawson’s figure:\r\nthe apparent absence of an apical sinus in the ‘wing’ is probably\r\ndue either to an error in interpretation or to some imperfection in\r\nthe specimen. As fig. 502, A, shows, the type-specimens are far from\r\nsatisfactory, and it may be that they are not specifically identical\r\nwith the more complete specimens from European strata referred to\r\nDawson’s species. Zeiller[985] points out that seeds of this species\r\nvary considerably in size, but there is always in well-preserved\r\nexamples a bifid beak at the apex. Seeds of similar form though not\r\nspecifically identical are described from the Coal Measures of Missouri\r\nas _Cardiocarpon (Samaropsis) Branneri_ Fairch. and White[986]. Good\r\nexamples of _S. fluitans_ are figured by Weiss[987] from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Saarbrücken and the species is widely distributed in Upper\r\nCarboniferous beds generally.\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis bicaudata_ Kidston. This species (fig. 502, E) originally\r\ndescribed[988] from Lower Carboniferous rocks in Scotland as\r\n_Cardiocarpus bicaudata_ and subsequently assigned to _Samaropsis_, is\r\ncharacterised by a greater development of the flat wing-like border\r\nwhich is divided into two long tapering basal lobes. Seeds of similar\r\nform are figured by Lesquereux[989] from Pennsylvania as _Cardiocarpus_\r\n(_Ptilocarpus_) _bicornutus_.\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis_ (_Samarospermum_) _moravica_ (Helmhacher). This type[990]\r\n(fig. 502, H) is characterised by the great length of the wing-like\r\nborder and on that account it was transferred by Arber to a new genus.\r\nIt was originally described by Helmhacher from the Permian of Moravia\r\nas _Jordania moravica_ and the type-specimen has been refigured by\r\nZeiller[991] who records the species from Upper Carboniferous and\r\nPermian rocks in France: it is recorded also from several localities\r\nin Germany[992]. Seeds figured by Potonié[993] from the Permian of\r\nThuringia as _Samaropsis Crampii_ (Hartt) are undoubtedly examples of\r\n_S. moravica_: the true _S. Crampii_ has recently been well illustrated\r\nby Dr Stopes[994] from the Westphalian of New Brunswick. The species is\r\nrecorded by Arber[995] from the Kent coalfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis emarginata_ (Goeppert and Barger).\r\n\r\nThe seed represented in fig. 502, B, from the Lower Coal Measures\r\nof Kilmarnock, Scotland[996], affords a good example of the genus:\r\nthe species was originally described by Berger as _Cardiocarpon\r\nemarginatum_ and it was on this type that Fiedler founded the\r\ngenus _Cyclocarpon_[997]. It has been referred by many authors to\r\n_Cardiocarpon_ and might be regarded as a type intermediate between\r\n_Cordaicarpus_, as used in this chapter, and _Samaropsis_, though the\r\nbreadth of the border is more in keeping with the latter designation.\r\nThe figured specimen is 1·6 cm. long and 1·4 cm. broad; the nucule has\r\na slightly cordate base and shows several faint converging ribs which\r\nare too inconspicuous to be represented in a natural-size drawing.\r\nA narrow median groove in the apical region shows the position of a\r\nvascular strand. The species is recorded from several countries:\r\nsimilar though specifically distinct seeds, described by Dawson\r\nas _Cardiocarpon cornutum_, have recently been re-described by Dr\r\nStopes[998] from the Westphalian of New Brunswick where they occur in\r\nassociation with the leaves of _Cordaites Robbii_ Daws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 502.

All nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis Newberryi_ Andrews.\r\n\r\nThis species was originally described by Andrews[999] from the Coal\r\nMeasures of Ohio: the specimen shown in fig. 502, K, was sent to Dr\r\nKidston by Mr Claypole. The whole seed is 5 cm. wide and 3·5 cm. in\r\ndepth; it is characterised by a short and relatively broad nucule\r\nsurrounded by a very broad and flat border showing faintly marked\r\nradially disposed lines and in places some irregularly distributed\r\npits. The apex is emarginate and there is a broad and deep sinus in\r\nthe sarcotesta in the chalazal region. The seed resembles _Samaropsis\r\nalata_ Kidst.[1000] and _S. Baileyi_ (Daws.)[1001] but it differs from\r\nthese in the greater breadth of the ‘wing’ and in the form of the\r\nnucule.\r\n\r\nThe seed described by Fiedler[1002] as _Jordania bignonioides_\r\n(fig. 502, I) agrees closely with _S. alata_ Kidst. but is probably\r\nspecifically distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis barcellosa_ (White).\r\n\r\nWhite[1003] described this species (fig. 502, G) from\r\nPermo-Carboniferous rocks in Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul) as\r\n_Cardiocarpon barcellosum_. The nucule is said to be cordate but, as\r\nseen in the figure, there is no clear indication of a basal sinus: the\r\npresence of a relatively broad ‘wing,’ as White says, entitles the seed\r\n‘to a place in the _Samaropsis_ section of the genus.’ The author of\r\nthe species compares it with seeds described from Westphalian rocks in\r\nOhio[1004] and Pennsylvania[1005]. It is interesting to find a type\r\nwhich is common in both Europe and North America in the western portion\r\nof Gondwana Land. Seeds of similar form are recorded also from India,\r\nSouth Africa, and Australia[1006].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis Seixasi_ (White).\r\n\r\nThis Brazilian species from the same beds is described by White as\r\n_Gangamopteris_ (_Samaropsis_) _Seixasi_[1007]: it is characterised by\r\na small ovate nucule 8–10 mm. long and 5 mm. broad, in some specimens\r\nsurrounded by a complete ‘wing’ extending above the apex and below the\r\nbase, giving the seed an appearance similar to that of _Samaropsis_\r\n(_Samarospermum_) _moravica_ while sometimes, as in the example shown\r\nin fig. 502, F, the broad border is preserved only at the sides.\r\nThese seeds are abundant in the Santa Catharina beds, where they were\r\ndiscovered by Dr Esdras do Prado Seixas, in association with leaves of\r\n_Gangamopteris_, and White thinks that they were borne on the fertile\r\nleaves of that genus which he has named _Arberia_[1008]. Although\r\nthere is as yet no proof of a connexion between _Gangamopteris_ and\r\nseeds of this or any other type it is almost certain that it was a\r\nseed-producing plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis Leslii_ sp. nov.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 503. _Samaropsis Leslii_. From Vereeniging, S.\r\nAfrica. (Mr Leslie’s Collection; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe seed on which this species is founded was discovered by Mr T. N.\r\nLeslie in the Ecca beds (Permo-Carboniferous) of Vereeniging, South\r\nAfrica, a locality from which the same geologist has obtained leaves of\r\n_Cordaites_, _Psygmophyllum_, _Glossopteris_ and other genera[1009].\r\nIn the slightly cordate base and tapered apex (fig. 503) the nucule\r\nagrees closely with those of European examples, but the Vereeniging\r\ntype is distinguished by its larger dimensions and by the wider border\r\nindicating a thick sarcotesta continued basally into a stout stalk. The\r\napex is emarginate and a median rib marks the position of a vascular\r\nstrand. There is no evidence as to the nature of the parent-plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis indica_ (Zeiller).\r\n\r\nProf. Zeiller[1010] described this species as _Cardiocarpus indicus_\r\nfrom the Karharbari (Lower Gondwana) beds of India. An examination of\r\nthe type-specimens enables me to confirm the accuracy of the original\r\naccount. The platyspermic seed is 5·5 cm. long and 4·5 cm. broad;\r\na cordate nucule is enclosed by a flat border similar to that of\r\n_Samaropsis Leslii_ but narrower especially on the sides of the nucule.\r\nAt the apex there is a deep sinus extending to the nucule, and at the\r\nbase a fairly broad band of carbonaceous matter shows the position of\r\nthe chalazal vascular strand. The seed is characterised by its large\r\nsize and by its almost orbicular form: it occurs as a detached specimen\r\nin beds containing _Cordaites_ (_Noeggerathiopsis_) and _Glossopteris_.\r\n\r\nA species from Arkansas described by Lesquereux[1011] as _Cardiocarpus\r\ningens_ [= _Cordaicarpus ingens_ (Lesq.)] affords another example of a\r\nlarge seed similar to _C. indicus_ and, except in its more orbicular\r\nform, to _Samaropsis Leslii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samaropsis Milleri_ (Feistmantel).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 504. _Samaropsis Milleri._ (Indian Geological\r\nSurvey, Calcutta; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the type-specimen from the Calcutta Museum enables\r\nme to amplify the original description in an important particular. The\r\nspecies was found in Lower Gondwana (Katharbari) beds in India and\r\nreferred by Feistmantel[1012] to the genus _Carpolithes_. Arber[1013],\r\nwho tentatively employed the generic name _Cardiocarpus_ in place\r\nof _Carpolithes_, suggests that the seeds may be radiospermic, as\r\nFeistmantel’s drawings show only a very narrow border to the nucule.\r\nThe specimen reproduced in fig. 504 was figured by Feistmantel without\r\nany indication of a definite sarcotesta or wing, but as seen in the\r\ndrawing the ovate cordate sclerotesta is surrounded on one side and at\r\nthe base by an outer envelope: this is clearly seen at the apex where\r\nit shows a rounded termination sloping downwards towards the micropyle\r\nprecisely as in _Samaropsis indica_ (Zeill.). The border is narrow at\r\nthe sides and broader at the base as in _S. Leslii_. The seed is 4·5\r\ncm. long and 2·3 cm. broad, differing from _S. indica_ in its rather\r\nsmaller size and in the slightly narrower nucule. Though there is no\r\ndecisive evidence as to the parent-plant the occurrence of a specimen\r\nof this species partially covered by a scale-leaf of a type[1014]\r\nvery similar to that which is generally recognised as belonging to\r\n_Glossopteris_ suggests the possibility that the seeds may belong to\r\nthat genus. Scale-leaves of _Glossopteris_ are described in Volume\r\n+ii.+, but it may be added here that leaves similar in form to those\r\nfrom India, Australia, and elsewhere are figured by Geinitz[1015]\r\nfrom the Altai Mountains as _Trigonocarpus_? _actaeonelloides_: the\r\nspecimens are represented with the basal scar at the apex.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cordaicarpus.= Geinitz.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the generic names _Cardiocarpus_,\r\n_Cordaicarpus_, and other designations have been applied to casts\r\nand impressions which cannot be distinguished by any constant or\r\nimportant feature it is proposed to adopt the name _Cordaicarpus_\r\nfor platyspermic seeds, preserved as casts or impressions, having\r\na comparatively narrow border enclosing an ovate or cordate-ovate\r\nnucule; the base is either rounded or cordate. The choice between\r\n_Cordaicarpus_ and _Samaropsis_ depends on the breadth of the border.\r\n_Cordaicarpus_, though more suggestive of a Cordaitean alliance, may in\r\nsome cases be a Pteridosperm seed.\r\n\r\n_Cordaicarpus Cordai_ (Geinitz). Lenticular seeds more or less\r\norbicular or broadly ovate (fig. 502, C, D), often slightly cordate at\r\nthe base of the nucule and with a broadly acute apex: the border is\r\nnarrow or sometimes hardly represented as in the seeds described by\r\nBerger as _Rhabdocarpus ovoides_, a species similar to but more oval\r\nthan _Cordaicarpus Cordai_. The latter species[1016] occurs in several\r\ncoalfields in Britain, France, Germany, and elsewhere. Fig. 502, C,\r\nshows a good example from the Middle Coal Measures of Yorkshire, 9 mm.\r\nlong by 8 mm. broad; on the very slightly cordate nucule are several\r\nfaint ribs converging towards the base and apex and between them\r\nfine striations, characters too indistinct to be reproduced in the\r\nnatural-size drawing. The flat border represents the sclerotesta. The\r\nseed shown in fig. 502, D, from the Westphalian series of Warwickshire\r\nbelongs to the same species or is a closely allied type: the faint\r\nsuggestion of reticulation on its surface might be regarded as a reason\r\nfor referring it to _C. areolatus_ Boul.[1017], a form characterised\r\nby a reticulation on the testa, described by Zeiller[1018] and other\r\nauthors. This reticulation is, however, in some cases at least, formed\r\nby crumpling and splitting of the superficial carbonised film into more\r\nor less regular meshes: the figured specimen occurs with several other\r\nseeds of the same type, most of which have a smooth surface. Dr Kidston\r\ntells me that a recent critical examination of seeds in his collection\r\nleads him to regard some specimens (_e.g._ fig. 502, D) previously\r\nreferred by him to _C. Cordai_ as identical with _Carpolithes\r\nmembranaceus_ Goepp.[1019]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 505. _Cordaicarpus Cordai._ Cuticle of the testa.\r\n(Kidston Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe photograph reproduced in fig. 505 shows the result of chemically\r\ntreating the carbonised cuticle of a seed of _Cordaicarpus Cordai_, a\r\nmethod little used as yet in the case of Palaeozoic plants but which\r\nmay be useful in distinguishing seeds which cannot be satisfactorily\r\nseparated by microscopic features. The superficial cells have very\r\nthick walls and present an appearance similar to that of the sclerous\r\ncells in the testas of some petrified specimens.\r\n\r\nThe larger seed shown in fig. 501, D, from Commentry, described by\r\nRenault and Zeiller[1020] as _Cardiocarpus sclerotesta_, is another\r\nexample of _Cordaicarpus_ as now defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. +Miscellaneous Seeds.+\r\n\r\nIn this section are included genera based on characters of\r\ncomparatively little morphological importance; their claim to treatment\r\nunder a common heading is that we know little or nothing of their\r\nanatomical features or of the parent-plants.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Ribbed seeds._\r\n\r\nThe seeds represented by the following genera possess ribs or\r\nflanges usually in multiples of three; the transverse section may be\r\ntriangular, hexagonal, or polygonal. The symmetry is generally radial,\r\nbut it is difficult to determine whether a slight departure from the\r\nradiospermic form is an original feature or the result of pressure.\r\nSome of the ribbed seeds with which we are now concerned are no doubt\r\nclosely allied to _Trigonocarpus_ and should be included in the\r\nTrigonocarpales, but others may well be distinct forms.\r\n\r\nGenera: _Hexagonocarpus_, _Decagonocarpus_, _Polypterocarpus_,\r\n_Rhynchogonium_, _Boroviczia_, _Diplopterotesta_, _Musocarpus_,\r\n_Holcospermum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hexagonocarpus.= Renault.\r\n\r\nThis generic name is adopted by Renault[1021] for casts from Commentry\r\nwhich, while probably identical with Brongniart’s _Hexapterospermum_,\r\nafford no confirmatory anatomical evidence. The species _Hexagonocarpus\r\ncrassus_[1022] is represented by casts or nucules characterised\r\nby six well-defined ribs and grooves with a length of nearly 3\r\ncm. In this genus may be included the cast from the Coal Measures\r\nof Lancashire described by Williamson[1023] as _Hexapterospermum\r\nNoeggerathi_ (fig. 506, H), and another British example is afforded\r\nby _Hexagonocarpus Hookeri_ Kidst.[1024], a rare fossil in the South\r\nStaffordshire coalfield. It is impossible confidently to assign these\r\nribbed casts to genera founded on petrified specimens as they almost\r\ncertainly belong to different types, but the employment of the name\r\n_Hexagonocarpus_ may conveniently be used for casts or impressions of\r\nseeds with six longitudinal ribs differing in their relatively broader\r\nand less prominent form from the wing-like flanges of _Polypterocarpus_\r\n(cf. fig. 496, B). The seeds described by Dr P. Bertrand[1025] as\r\n_Hexapterospermum modestae_, and believed by him to belong to a plant\r\nwith _Neuropteris_ fronds, should be included in _Hexagonocarpus_ as we\r\nhave no definite knowledge of their anatomical features.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Decagonocarpus.= Renault.\r\n\r\nThis name, proposed by Renault[1026], is applied to seeds without\r\npetrified tissues characterised by ten ribs; an example is afforded\r\nby _Decagonocarpus olivaeformis_ from the Commentry coalfield, an\r\nelliptical seed which bears a close resemblance to _Holcospermum\r\nsulcatum_ (fig. 506, A) except in the smaller number of ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polypterocarpus.= Grand’Eury.\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[1027] adopted this generic name for seeds from St Étienne\r\ncharacterised by the presence of three, six, or more deep wings\r\nor flanges. The term _Pterospermum_ has recently been proposed by\r\nArber[1028] for a seed from the Coal Measures of Staffordshire, which\r\nhe names _P. anglicum_: the type-species of the genus has three deep\r\nwings, one from each angle. For the same seed Kidston[1029] proposed\r\nthe name _Tripterospermum ellipticum_, but as Arber’s account was\r\npublished first his specific name has priority. _Pterospermum_ had,\r\nhowever, been previously used for a genus of Sterculiaceae, and partly\r\non this account but mainly because Grand’Eury’s genus _Polypterocarpus_\r\nis available the latter designation is adopted. In _Polypterocarpus\r\nanglicus_ (fig. 496, B) the flanges project slightly beyond the apex\r\nof the seed and there is a small notch at the base; the nucule is 5\r\ncm. long and 1 cm. broad. While it is not improbable that this seed\r\nis generically identical with Brongniart’s _Tripterospermum_[1030],\r\nit is safer, in the absence of structural details, to employ the less\r\ncommittal term. There is no information with regard to the nature of\r\nthe parent-plants of species of _Polypterocarpus_. The English seed\r\nfrom the Middle Coal Measures of Derbyshire and the Staffordshire\r\ncoalfield described by Arber[1031] as _Radiospermum ornatum_ and by\r\nKidston[1032] as _Polypterospermum ornatum_ affords another example of\r\n_Polypterocarpus_ as the generic name is here employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhynchogonium.= Heer.\r\n\r\nHeer[1033] proposed this generic name for some globose, ovate, or\r\noblong ‘fruits’ from Lower Carboniferous strata in Spitzbergen,\r\nincluding also fragments of ‘leaves’ which without satisfactory\r\nevidence he believed to belong to the same plant. The supposed\r\nfruits are clearly seeds, and Nathorst regards the ‘leaves’ as\r\nportions of a Fern rachis. Heer described four species, but these\r\nhave since been reduced to two, and indeed it is probable that only\r\none type, _Rhynchogonium costatum_, is represented. Nathorst[1034]\r\ncompares Heer’s seeds with a Lower Carboniferous species described\r\nby Young[1035] as _Trigonocarpum gloagianum_, the resemblance of\r\nwhich to the Spitzbergen seeds was pointed out by Kidston. A seed of\r\n_Rhynchogonium costatum_ is about the size of a hazel-nut and may\r\nreach a length of 21 mm.; it is ovate, with a broad rounded base,\r\nand in the upper third is tapered and conical, the sides of the\r\ncharacteristic snout being distinguished from the smooth surface of\r\nthe rest of the seed by the presence of eight ribs converging towards\r\nthe apex (506, G). Zalessky[1036] recorded closely allied seeds from\r\nLower Carboniferous beds in Northern Russia, assigning them to a new\r\ngenus _Boroviczia_, the type-species being _B. Karpinskii_; he adduced\r\narguments in favour of Heer’s interpretation of the fossils as fruits\r\nbut, according to Nathorst, this view has been abandoned. In his recent\r\nmemoir on the Culm flora of Spitzbergen Nathorst[1037] discusses the\r\nmorphological nature of _Rhynchogonium_ seeds and describes additional\r\nspecimens. Without the aid of petrified examples it is hardly possible\r\nto determine the true nature of the fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 506. A, _Holcospermum sulcatum_.

This species was originally\r\ndescribed by Lindley and Hutton as _Carpolithes sulcata[1038]_ from\r\nLower Carboniferous rocks at Newhaven in Scotland and has recently been\r\nfigured by Zalessky[1039] from specimens in the Kidston collection\r\nfrom the Lower Calciferous sandstone of Midlothian. Nothing definite\r\ncan be said as to the parent-plant, but it is significant that in\r\nMidlothian _Rhynchogonium sulcatum_ occurs in a bed full of isolated\r\npinnules of a _Cardiopteris_ almost to the exclusion of any other\r\nfossils[1040].\r\n\r\nThe seed figured by Nathorst[1041] from the Culm of Spitzbergen as\r\n_Lagenospermum? glandiforme_ agrees closely with _Rhynchogonium_\r\nand _Boroviczia_, and it is impossible to decide whether the lobed\r\nappearance is due to the presence of a cupule or to the divisions of an\r\nintegument.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boroviczia.= Zalessky.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from Lower Carboniferous beds in Russia[1042] on which\r\nthis genus was founded are perhaps unnecessarily separated from\r\n_Rhynchogonium_; they are ovate and beaked, 10 mm. long with a maximum\r\nbreadth of 6 mm. The type-species, _Boroviczia Karpinskii_ (fig. 506,\r\nI), is represented both by specimens in which the cast is complete\r\nand by others in which the apical snout of the integument is split\r\ninto separate lobes identical in form and apparently in number with\r\nthose of _Rhynchogonium_. Nathorst[1043], who retains the generic name\r\nand describes two additional species from Spitzbergen, points out\r\nthat in Boroviczia the tapered apex is more sharply differentiated\r\nfrom the broader basal portion, a difference hardly worthy of generic\r\nrecognition. If _Boroviczia_ is retained as a genus distinct from\r\n_Rhynchogonium_ it should include the seeds described by Young as\r\n_Trigonocarpum gloagianum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diplopterotesta.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\n_Diplopterotesta spitzbergensis_ (Heer). Heer[1044] included in\r\n_Samaropsis_ some seeds, described as _Samaropsis spitzbergensis_, from\r\nLower Carboniferous strata in Spitzbergen which differ considerably\r\nfrom typical examples of the genus. These have recently been made the\r\ntype of a new genus _Diplopterotesta_[1045]: they are platyspermic\r\nseeds nearly twice as long as broad, 6–9 × 3·5–5 mm., characterised\r\nby a thin sclerotesta expanded throughout the length of the seed into\r\ntwo prominent transversely striated wing-like ribs or flanges (fig.\r\n506, D). At the apex, which is broad in contrast to the pointed basal\r\nend of the seed, the sclerotesta forms a crown of eight lobes about\r\nthe flat summit of the seed-body. As Nathorst points out, this species\r\nclosely resembles the Carboniferous seeds figured by Grand’Eury[1046]\r\nas _Polypterocarpus_, but in the latter type there are more than two\r\nwings. Nathorst’s figures, one of which is reproduced in fig. 506, D,\r\nsuggest a difficulty in determining the number of the flanges, which\r\nwould seem to be more than two, but this appearance is regarded by\r\nNathorst as misleading and he believes that except at the apex there\r\nare only two wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Musocarpus.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[1047] proposed this name for two species, _M. prismaticus_\r\nand _M. difformis_, from French Coal Measures, but gave no description\r\nof the specimens. The type-species, described from the Loire by\r\nGrand’Eury as _Musocarpus prismaticus_[1048], is an ovate seed nearly\r\n3 cm. long with six longitudinal ribs, three being more prominent\r\nthan the others, and characterised by a ribbed prolongation of\r\nthe base of uniform diameter spoken of as a carpophore, which was\r\napparently articulated to the lower part of the seed-proper from which\r\nit was easily detached by a natural absciss-layer. Nothing is known\r\nof the structure or of the affinity of the genus. Some specimens\r\nin Dr Kidston’s collection from Westphalian beds in Lanarkshire\r\nare closely allied to or perhaps identical with _M. prismaticus_.\r\nIn the presence of a distinct basal region _Musocarpus_ resembles\r\n_Codonospermum_[1049], though without any knowledge of the anatomy of\r\nthe former type it is impossible to say whether or not this resemblance\r\nhas any morphological importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Holcospermum.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\n_Holcospermum sulcatum_ (Sternberg). The cast reproduced in fig. 506,\r\nA, affords a good example of a form of seed recorded under several\r\ngeneric names and not uncommon in Upper Palaeozoic rocks in Europe\r\nand North America, which in most cases cannot be assigned to a genus\r\nimplying the possession of certain anatomical characters. This type\r\nwas figured by Sternberg[1050] from the Coal Measures of Radnitz as\r\n_Carpolites sulcatus_. Some ‘fruits’ collected on the beach near\r\nNewhaven, Midlothian, from the Calciferous Sandstone series, are\r\nfigured by Lindley and Hutton[1051] as _Carpolithes sulcata_, but\r\nas already stated these have been transferred[1052] to the genus\r\n_Rhynchogonium_. Several authors have referred specimens of the type\r\nnow included in _Holcospermum_ to _Rhabdocarpus_, but that genus, as\r\nstated on a previous page, is restricted to seeds agreeing in form\r\nwith _R. tunicatus_. Renault[1053] instituted the genus _Colpospermum_\r\nfor a partially petrified seed from Commentry agreeing externally with\r\n_Carpolites sulcatus_ Sternb. and regarded by him as specifically\r\nidentical, characterised by longitudinal ribs which represent folds\r\nof the testa, the intervening grooves being occupied by an irregular\r\nreticulum formed by occasionally anastomosing smaller ribs. The generic\r\nname _Colpospermum_ should therefore be reserved for ribbed seeds\r\nshowing the anatomical features described by Renault and Zeiller:\r\nits application to Sternberg’s species is inadvisable on the ground\r\nthat we have no information with regard to the morphological nature\r\nof the ribbing. More recently Arber[1054] has proposed the name\r\n_Platyspermum_, a name previously applied to a Cruciferous plant,\r\nfor Stephanian and Permian seeds formerly assigned to Berger’s genus\r\n_Rhabdocarpus_, which are symmetrical in two planes. In this genus\r\nhe includes _Platyspermum sulcatum_ and among other species _P.\r\nKidstoni_ founded on a seed originally identified by Kidston[1055] as\r\n_Rhabdocarpus multistriatus_ Sternb. which, though probably a distinct\r\nspecies, is of the same general type as _C. sulcatus_ Sternb.\r\n\r\nThe cast represented in fig. 506, A, from the Middle Coal Measures of\r\nYorkshire is 3·5 cm. long and has 18 regular longitudinal ribs: it is\r\nradially symmetrical and does not conform in this respect to Arber’s\r\ndefinition of _Platyspermum_. In many cases, _e.g._ the flattened seed\r\nfigured by Kidston as _Rhabdocarpus multistriatus_, it is impossible to\r\ndetermine the symmetry of the seed. The old generic name _Carpolites_,\r\n_Carpolithes_ or _Carpolithus_ has been used in a very wide sense and\r\ndoes not connote any well-defined features; it should be reserved,\r\nin the form _Carpolithus_ as used by Linnaeus, for seeds that cannot\r\nbe assigned to a systematic position or which do not exhibit any\r\ndistinctive characters worthy of emphasis by the institution of a\r\nspecial name. The generic term _Holcospermum_, recently proposed\r\nby Nathorst[1056], is a suitable name for this type of seed; as\r\ndefined by the author, it includes seeds that may be radiospermic or\r\nplatyspermic. Specimens of the type-species, _H. dubium_[1057],from\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous beds of Spitzbergen, agree closely in size\r\nand shape with some examples of _Rhynchogonium_ and _Boroviczia_, but\r\nthey are distinguished by prominent ribs extending the whole length\r\nof the cast. In some seeds similar to _H. sulcatum_ the ribs form\r\nsharp ridges, but the difference between rounded and sharp ridges is\r\noften determined by the method of preservation: a specimen deprived of\r\nits outer flesh would form a cast more sharply ribbed than a seed in\r\nwhich the sarcotesta had been moulded on to the ribbed sclerotesta.\r\nOn the other hand some ribs are formed by blunt sclerotestal folds as\r\nin _Colpospermum_: both types of ribbing are included in the genus\r\n_Holcospermum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Other Genera._\r\n\r\n=Malacotesta.= Williamson.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Williamson[1058] for a petrified\r\nseed from the Coal Measures of Lancashire which he named _Malacotesta\r\noblonga_: the type-specimen is a small seed 6–7 mm. long characterised\r\nby a thick fleshy integument. The structure is however insufficiently\r\nknown to admit of a satisfactory comparison of the imperfectly\r\npreserved specimen figured by Williamson with other types.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thysanotesta.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\nNathorst[1059] founded this genus on a single seed from the Lower\r\nCarboniferous plant-beds of Spitzbergen which exhibits features\r\nsufficiently distinctive to justify its recognition as the type of a\r\nseparate genus.\r\n\r\n_Thysanotesta sagittula_ Nathorst. The type-specimen is a long and\r\nnarrow seed, 20 mm. long, ovate below and prolonged apically into a\r\nslender beak, 8 mm. in length, which probably represents a micropylar\r\ntube; the beak bears numerous stiff hairs (fig. 506, F). The seed\r\nclosely resembles a carpel of _Erodium_ without the horizontal part\r\nof the awn. There is no evidence as to the nature of the parent-plant\r\nbut the species affords an interesting example of a Palaeozoic seed\r\napparently adapted for wind-dispersal, or possibly the bristles may\r\nhave served the same purpose as in the fruits of _Erodium_. Attention\r\nis called elsewhere[1060] to the frequent resemblance of Palaeozoic\r\nseeds such as _Thysanotesta_ to fruits of recent flowering plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carpolithus.= Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nNathorst[1061] has pointed out that this generic name was employed by\r\nLinnaeus for fossil fruits: in the form _Carpolites_ (Sternberg) or\r\n_Carpolithes_[1062] it has been widely used and differently defined\r\nby authors, usually in a comprehensive sense including fossil seeds\r\nfrom both Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata which cannot be assigned to\r\na definite position in the plant-kingdom. It is desirable to adopt\r\nsome designation for seeds from strata of different ages which do not\r\nexhibit any features sufficiently distinctive to justify the creation\r\nof a special genus. By employing such a name as _Carpolithus_, without\r\nattempting to define its characters within prescribed limits, for casts\r\nor impressions of seeds which are not distinguished by any striking\r\ncharacters and cannot be allocated to any particular section of\r\nseed-bearing plants the unnecessary multiplication of generic titles\r\nis avoided: when any additional data are obtained differentiating\r\nparticular types from other forms of _Carpolithus_ the provisional\r\nterm should be superseded by some distinctive generic name. Among\r\nseeds from the Coal Measures there are several examples of both large\r\nand small types without any regular ribs or lacking such features\r\nas serve to distinguish the genera already described, which are\r\nappropriately included in _Carpolithus_. The two species _Carpolithus\r\nWildii_ Kidst.[1063] and _C. bivalvis_ Goepp.[1064] are two examples\r\nof seeds from Upper Carboniferous rocks which it is desirable to refer\r\nto this comprehensive genus pending further discoveries as to their\r\nmorphological features. The Jurassic species _C. conicus_ Lind. and\r\nHutt.[1065] is another type which it has been customary to include in\r\n_Carpolithus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Microspermum._ Arber.)\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Microspermum_ has recently been proposed by\r\nArber[1066] for some Westphalian seeds described by Carpentier[1067]\r\nfrom the North of France as _Carpolithes? samaroides_ and for similar\r\nfossils from the Middle Coal Measures of Nottingham. The supposed seeds\r\nare small, ovate or pyriform bodies, 5–12 mm. long and 2·5–6 mm. broad,\r\nwith one extremity broadly rounded and the other acute: one side is\r\nkeeled, the other grooved, and a large foramen occurs near the broader\r\nend and on the grooved surface. Arber emphasises the fact that the\r\nspecimens are symmetrical in one plane only. As the author of the genus\r\npoints out the morphological nature of the fossils is not thoroughly\r\nestablished, nor is the parent-plant known. In view of the ill-defined\r\ncharacters of the specimens so far discovered it is hardly desirable\r\nto institute a new generic name implying their seed-nature; moreover\r\n_Microspermum_ has previously been employed for a genus of Compositae.\r\nAn examination of specimens leads me to doubt their seed-nature and it\r\nwould seem more likely that they are foliar organs, possibly bracts\r\nwhich originally bore seeds or sporangia.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn examination of some of the specimens of supposed Permian seeds for\r\nwhich Geinitz[1068] proposed the generic name _Guilelmites_ convinced\r\nme that they are inorganic structures, probably nodules in shale\r\nsmoothed and rounded by slickensiding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n                             CYCADOPHYTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Cycadophyta, suggested by Nathorst[1069], is used in a\r\ncomprehensive sense to include both recent Cycads and the much\r\nlarger number of extinct types which it is customary to speak of\r\nas Cycadean plants or fossil Cycads. The designation ‘Cycads’ in\r\nthe case of the majority of the fossil forms is, however, open to\r\ncriticism on the ground that they differ too widely from existing\r\ngenera to be associated with them in one class. It would be pedantic\r\nand inconvenient to give up the almost universal practice of extending\r\nthe term Cycad beyond the limits defined by the characters of\r\nrecent species. The important point is to adopt some classification\r\nwhich gives expression to our views as to the degree of affinity\r\nbetween recent and extinct types. In a considerable number of cases,\r\nespecially impressions of presumably Cycadean fronds and stems that\r\noccur without any fertile shoots, it is impossible to determine the\r\ndegree of relationship to modern types. It was with a view to a\r\nrational group-designation for such fossils that Nathorst proposed\r\nthe term Cycadophyta, including in it the two classes Cycadales and\r\nBennettitales. The Cycadales comprise the recent genera and such\r\nextinct types as may legitimately be included in the same class, but\r\nas we shall see later there are hardly any fossil species that can be\r\nassigned to this section on thoroughly satisfactory grounds. The term\r\nBennettitales is used by Engler, Nathorst, and several other authors as\r\na class-designation for a large number of Mesozoic Cycads agreeing in\r\ntheir more important morphological characters with the Lower Cretaceous\r\nstems on which Carruthers[1070] founded the genus _Bennettites_,\r\nplacing it in a new tribe, the Bennettiteae. Some authors have followed\r\nCarruthers in the use of the family-name Bennettiteae for a subdivision\r\nof the Cycadales equal in rank to the Cycadaceae, while others, wishing\r\nto give greater emphasis to the difference between the extinct and\r\nrecent plants, prefer to adopt the class-name Bennettitales. Carruthers\r\nregarded _Bennettites_ as occupying the same position in relation to\r\nother Cycads as _Taxus_ holds with regard to the cone-bearing members\r\nof the Coniferae. The adoption of Bennettitales is intended to convey\r\nthe impression that the class is more distantly related to the recent\r\nCycads than is implied by the analogy of _Taxus_. Nathorst[1071], as\r\nthe result of his discovery of certain reproductive organs associated\r\nwith some Rhaetic fronds described as _Dioonites spectabilis_, proposed\r\na third subdivision, the Dioonitales, but he subsequently[1072]\r\nrestored the fronds to their original designation _Nilssonia\r\npterophylloides_, and on further examination found that the supposed\r\nmicrospore-bearing organs were seeds. _Nilssonia pterophylloides_\r\nwould therefore find a more natural place in the class Nilssoniales\r\ninstituted by Thomas[1073].\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNETTITALES.\r\n\r\n=Cycadeoidea.= Buckland.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Buckland[1074] proposed the generic name _Cycadeoidea_ for\r\nsome petrified stems from the Purbeck beds in the Isle of Portland and\r\npublished a description of two species, _Cycadeoidea megalophylla_\r\nand _C. microphylla_. Brongniart[1075] considered Buckland’s term\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ inappropriate and proposed in its place _Mantellia_, the\r\ntype-species being _Mantellia nidiformis_ Brongn., the Portland stem\r\nwhich Buckland a month or two later called independently _Cycadeoidea\r\nmegalophylla_. Subsequently Brongniart[1076] withdrew _Mantellia_ as\r\nit had been previously used by Parkinson for a sponge and substituted\r\n_Cycadites_. Some years later Carruthers[1077] revived _Mantellia_\r\nfor a type of Cycadean stem from Portland though one species,\r\napparently indistinguishable from those referred to _Mantellia_, he\r\nnamed _Bennettites portlandicus_. There is no adequate reason for the\r\nretention of the generic name _Mantellia_. The close resemblance of the\r\nshort and thick stems (12–30 cm. in height) described by Buckland to\r\nthose of some recent Cycads was recognised by Robert Brown and Loddiges\r\nand the former suggested to Buckland the inclusion of the fossils in\r\na new family Cycadeoideae. It was this suggestion that led Buckland\r\nto adopt _Cycadeoidea_ as a generic name. In a later account of the\r\nPortland stems Buckland[1078], in deference to Brongniart’s opinion,\r\nsubstituted Brongniart’s name _Cycadites_ for _Cycadeoidea_. It is\r\nnoteworthy that no reference is made in the original description to\r\nthe occurrence of lateral shoots among the persistent petiole-bases\r\nthat encase the Portland stems, but in a later account such shoots\r\nare represented in one of the figured stems and are compared with the\r\nbuds occasionally produced on stems of _Cycas_[1079]. The subsequent\r\nresearches of Carruthers[1080] demonstrated the reproductive nature\r\nof precisely similar lateral shoots in the stem on which he founded\r\nthe genus _Bennettites_. The generic name _Echinostipes_ given by\r\nPomel[1081], who had a passion for instituting new nomenclature, to\r\nBuckland’s Portland stems has not been adopted: his genus _Crossozamia_\r\nproposed for certain stems and fronds was revived by Carruthers[1082]\r\nbut has not been generally used. A further complication in the\r\nnomenclature of Cycadean stems was introduced by Saporta’s\r\ninstitution[1083] of _Bulbopodium_ and _Cylindropodium_: in the former\r\ngenus he included the small ovoid stem figured by Lindley and Hutton\r\nas _Cycadeoidea pygmaea_[1084] and two French Jurassic species which\r\nmight reasonably be assigned to _Cycadeoidea_. To _Cylindropodium_ were\r\nreferred some large French stems from Jurassic strata: an examination\r\nof the type-specimens in Paris convinced me that they are typical\r\nforms of _Cycadeoidea_. As Ward[1085] has pointed out, both Saporta’s\r\ngenera may be merged in _Cycadeoidea_. Fliche and Zeiller[1086] also\r\ninclude the small globular stems named by Saporta _Bulbopodium_ in\r\nthe older genus _Cycadeoidea_: one such type from the Portlandian of\r\nBoulogne is described by these authors as _Cycadeoidea pumila_. Saporta\r\nalso proposed the name _Platylepis_[1087], the type-species being\r\n_Cycadeoidea micromyela_ Mor., from the Lias of Calvados, which has\r\nrecently been investigated by Lignier[1088] who wisely adopts Morière’s\r\ndesignation. Another unnecessary generic name is _Schizopodium_ given\r\nby Morière to a stem, _S. Renaulti_[1089], regarded by Lignier as\r\nindistinguishable specifically from _C. micromyela_.\r\n\r\nThe two names _Cycadeoidea_ and _Bennettites_ have been used by\r\nauthors for stems which are unquestionably generically identical\r\nand as is often the case much confusion has been caused through the\r\nfailure of palaeobotanists to arrive at an agreement. Lester Ward, a\r\nstaunch advocate of the rule of priority, repeatedly pointed out that\r\nBuckland’s name _Cycadeoidea_ should take precedence of _Bennettites_\r\non the ground that stems for which these genera were instituted are\r\nclearly of the same type, and he added that the older genus, though\r\nabandoned by its author, cannot be given up without violating the\r\ninexorable rules of priority. On the other hand it has been urged that\r\nthe genus _Bennettites_ as defined by Carruthers is characterised\r\nby the possession of (i) fertile shoots bearing strobili and (ii)\r\nvegetative organs exhibiting certain anatomical characters. Buckland’s\r\nspecies of _Cycadeoidea_, though bearing lateral shoots, are not well\r\nenough preserved to afford definite information as to the morphological\r\nfeatures of the strobili, nor have we satisfactory data with regard\r\nto the degree of resemblance between the vegetative features of\r\n_Bennettites_ and the Portland stems. Carruthers laid stress on the\r\nelliptical section of the stele in _Bennettites_ in contrast to the\r\ncylindrical cylinder of Buckland’s _Cycadeoidea_ trunks. Subsequent\r\nresearch has shown that this difference is not in itself a valid\r\ncriterion either of generic or specific rank but, as Wieland says, it\r\nis an open question to what extent the stem structure of _Cycadeoidea_\r\nand _Bennettites_ agrees. The probability is that were our knowledge\r\nof the Portland stems less incomplete, they would be found to possess\r\nno anatomical features inconsistent with this generic union. Granting\r\nthe correctness of this view, the adoption of the later generic term\r\nwould be a reasonable course to follow on the ground that it stands\r\nfor stems showing well preserved structure, while _Cycadeoidea_ was in\r\nthe first instance applied to stems showing only partially preserved\r\nstumps of strobili, and the name was not retained by its author. Graf\r\nSolms-Laubach[1090] and some other authors have used _Bennettites_ for\r\nCycadean stems possessing strobili of known structure such as those of\r\n_Bennettites Gibsonianus_, reserving _Cycadeoidea_ for similar stems\r\nbut without strobili sufficiently well preserved to afford evidence of\r\nmorphological characters. This practice I followed in 1895[1091], but\r\nmy usage of the two generic names has not been consistent, the name\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ being afterwards employed[1092] in a more comprehensive\r\nsense. The investigation of the reproductive shoots of American Lower\r\nCretaceous and Upper Jurassic Cycadean stems[1093] has demonstrated the\r\npractical identity of their ovulate strobili with those of the English\r\n_Bennettites_. It is clear that the American stems as well as numerous\r\nspecimens from Italy and other European localities are generically\r\ninseparable from _Bennettites_. The adoption of _Cycadeoidea_ by\r\nWieland, following Ward, has naturally strengthened the claim of\r\nBuckland’s genus at least so far as wide usage is concerned, and with\r\nsome reluctance I propose to fall in with this terminology and for\r\nthe sake of convenience to give up the use of _Bennettites_. Among\r\nMesozoic Cycadean stems agreeing with those of recent genera in habit\r\nand in the presence of an armour of persistent leaf-bases are several\r\nwhich afford no evidence either of the occurrence of fertile shoots\r\nor of lateral shoots with terminal flowers. To such stems the name\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ has been applied, the designation _Bennettites_ being\r\nrestricted to stems with lateral fertile shoots: this practice of\r\ntreating the absence of reproductive shoots as a characteristic feature\r\nof _Cycadeoidea_ is regarded by Wieland as illogical and artificial;\r\nand if, as seems probable, he is correct in believing that the majority\r\nof the Mesozoic Cycadean plants culminated their vegetative period by\r\nprolific development of flowers, the absence of flowering branches\r\nwould be contingent on a certain stage of development and not a generic\r\ncharacter. Dr Stopes[1094] has recently published facts with regard\r\nto the anatomical features of Cycadean stems which have a bearing\r\non the vexed question of nomenclature, but are more important from\r\na morphological point of view as they indicate a closer agreement\r\nbetween certain types of Lower Cretaceous stems and those of _Cycas_\r\nand other recent genera, in which successive rings of vascular tissue\r\nare developed, than has previously been recognised. In her diagnosis of\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ she includes the following statement: ‘In its internal\r\nanatomy the trunk shows two or more (up to eight are recorded) zones\r\nof secondary wood, the zones composed of distinct series of tracheids\r\neach more or less regularly arranged in radial sequence.’ It is\r\nclaimed that the addition of this character constitutes for the first\r\ntime a clear distinction between _Cycadeoidea_ and _Bennettites_. Dr\r\nStopes states that the two stems on which Buckland founded the genus\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ are lost and adds that Buckland’s type has certain\r\nanatomical features which are not found in _Bennettites_. Buckland\r\nin his description of _C. microphylla_ states that there are ‘two\r\nlaminated circles’ in the stem instead of the usual single cylinder,\r\na character suggestive of _Cycas_. In the original figure of this\r\nspecies there are no indications of any lateral fertile shoots though,\r\nas Dr Stopes says, many of the Portland stems undoubtedly possessed\r\nsuch flowers. This author makes no reference to Buckland’s later\r\ndescription of _C. microphylla_: in this it is stated that the stem\r\nbears numerous buds rising from the axillae of petioles, and these\r\nare shown in the illustration[1095]. Without access to the actual\r\nspecimen it is impossible to say whether or not the two ‘laminated\r\ncircles’ described and figured by Buckland[1096] are two distinct\r\ncylinders or parts of one cylinder separated by the infiltration of\r\nsome inorganic substance. In his description of _Cycadeoidea Yatesii_\r\nCarruthers spoke of the occurrence of two cylinders of wood, and this\r\nwas confirmed in a subsequent account of the type-specimen[1097]. Dr\r\nStopes gives a fuller account of Carruthers’ type and re-confirm a\r\nthe existence of two vascular cylinders; she also describes a new\r\nspecies, _C. buzzardensis_[1098] (fig. 578), in which there are 3–8\r\nor more cylinders. Neither of these stems affords any evidence of the\r\npossession of fertile shoots; they agree closely with stems of the\r\n_Bucklandia_ type in their comparatively slender habit and differ in\r\nthis respect from Buckland’s Portland species. The occurrence of more\r\nthan one vascular cylinder in the stems _Cycadeoidea_ (= _Bucklandia_)\r\n_Yatesii_ and _C._ (= _Bucklandia_) _buzzardensis_ suggests the\r\npossibility that this feature was characteristic of other species\r\nincluded in _Bucklandia_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that some at least of the stems referred to the genus\r\n_Bucklandia_ bore flowers of the _Williamsonia_ type[1099], and it is\r\nnot improbable that the stems described by Dr Stopes as _Cycadeoidea\r\nYatesii_ and _C. buzzardensis_ (fig. 578) possessed fertile shoots\r\ncomparable with those of the Middle Jurassic species _W. gigas_.\r\nDr Stopes’s contribution, while establishing a close agreement in\r\nanatomical features between some Lower Cretaceous stems and those of\r\n_Cycas_, does not warrant the further conclusion that these stems\r\nwere in other morphological characters closely allied to modern\r\nCycads. The main features of _Cycadeoidea_ may be summarised as\r\nfollows: The principal trunk is generally unbranched (fig. 507)\r\nand identical in habit with some species of _Macrozamia_, _Dioon_,\r\nand _Encephalartos_ (cf. figs. 379, 382); in some species, _e.g._\r\n_Cycadeoidea Marshiana_, _C. superba_[1100], _C. nana_[1101], the\r\nplant is represented by several approximately equal, thick, tuberous\r\nstems, in some cases easily separated from one another: a similar\r\nclustered habit is exhibited by certain forms of _Encephalartos_. The\r\nsize of a _Cycadeoidea_ trunk varies from a few centimetres in length\r\nwith a diameter of similar dimensions, as in _C. pumila_, to over a\r\nmetre long as in _C. gigantea_ (fig. 535), or as much as 3–4 metres in\r\n_C. Jenneyana_ with a diameter of about half a metre. The surface is\r\ncovered with persistent leaf-bases, exactly as in many recent Cycads,\r\nembedded in a thick mass of ramental scales which often stand out as\r\na prominent reticulum, the petioles having partially decayed before\r\nthe penetration of the mineralising solution through their harder\r\ntissues (fig. 507). On the conical terminal bud preserved in some\r\nstems (fig. 536) the foliage-leaves are replaced by linear scales.\r\nThe leaf-bases often show the vascular bundles which form a simpler\r\nsystem than in the majority of recent species, their arrangement being,\r\nas Wieland says, more Fern-like; they form a series of collateral\r\nstrands following the outline of the petiole-base[1102] with a U-shaped\r\ninvagination in the middle of the upper face (fig. 517, A). Beyond the\r\nstructure of the bundles at the base of the fronds and in the cortex\r\nof the stem our knowledge of the anatomy of the vascular supply of\r\nthe rachises is very meagre. At the petiole-base each bundle consists\r\neither entirely of radial rows of centrifugal scalariform tracheids and\r\nmedullary rays usually one-cell broad (fig. 519, B) or of centrifugal\r\nand centripetal xylem in varying proportions. The ground-tissue is\r\nwell supplied with large secretory canals and in the larger leaf-bases\r\nthere is a considerable development of periderm at the surface (fig.\r\n517, B) as in recent Cycads. The ramenta formed from the epidermal\r\ncells consist in most species of fairly broad scales one-cell thick\r\nat the edges and broader in the middle; in _Cycadeoidea nigra_[1103]\r\nthey are generally one-cell thick throughout and similar ramenta are\r\ncommon in _C. Gibsoniana_ (fig. 517, B). In _C. micromyela_ unicellular\r\nhairs replace the scaly ramenta, but transitional forms occur between\r\nhairs and scales. In _Williamsonia scotica_ (fig. 562) and in an Indian\r\nspecies of that genus the ramenta are exclusively long hairs as in\r\nrecent Cycads, the scale-form of the ramenta in _Cycadeoidea_ being a\r\nFern-character. The degree of development of the ramental tissue varies\r\nin different species; in _C. Stilwelli_ and _C. excelsa_ it is feebly\r\ndeveloped while in _Cycadeoidea micromyela_ the ramenta almost cover\r\nthe exposed leaf-base armour. The exceptional abundance of the ramental\r\nscales is a striking characteristic of some American stems referred\r\nto a separate genus, _Cycadella_[1104]. In the abundance of the\r\nramental tissue, in the compact structure of the well protected cones,\r\nand in the thickly cuticularised epidermis of the bracts and leaves\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ exhibits xerophilous characters in a very high degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 507. _Cycadeoidea marylandica._ The first\r\nAmerican stem to be described. On the side of the stem shown in the\r\nphotograph there are about 30 young strobili scattered among the\r\nleaf-bases. (After Wieland; ¼ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 508. _Cycadeoidea Wielandi._ Transverse sections\r\nof the secondary xylem of the stem. A, the middle region; B, the inner\r\nedge of the xylem. (After Wieland; × 100.)]\r\n\r\nWith very few exceptions the stems of _Cycadeoidea_ so far described\r\nafford no satisfactory evidence of the presence of more than one\r\nvascular cylinder in the main stem: in this respect _Cycadeoidea_\r\nagrees with such recent Cycads as _Dioon_, _Ceratozamia_, and\r\n_Stangeria_. In the stem of C. _Jenneyana_ the secondary vascular\r\ntissue reaches a considerable thickness and shows signs of ‘rings’\r\nin the xylem, but these are probably the result of some periodic\r\ninterference with the uniform growth and not an indication of more\r\nthan one xylem-cylinder. The secondary xylem (figs. 508, 509) consists\r\nonly of centrifugal tracheids with some spiral elements on the inner\r\nedge; though manoxylic, _Cycadeoidea_ has more compact wood than that\r\nof recent Cycads; the medullary rays are 1–2 cells broad except near\r\nthe perimedullary region where they are broader and the individual\r\ncells are tangentially stretched (fig. 508, B). The tracheids are\r\nscalariform, but in _C. micromyela_, an exceptional type, some of the\r\nxylem-elements have 1–2 rows of separate bordered pits (fig. 538). The\r\nphloem (fig. 518, B) is characterised by an alternation of thick-walled\r\nelements and thinner cells[1105]. From the main stele branches are\r\ngiven off to supply the flowering shoots in the form of a cylindrical\r\nstele like that of the primary axis, and each leaf-trace arises as\r\na single bundle which, in the form of a U-shaped strand (fig. 519,\r\nA), pursues a straight course to the leaf-base (fig. 510) where it\r\nbreaks up into several branches (fig. 538, B). Both leaf-trace and\r\npeduncle stele are given off from the lower edge of a medullary ray.\r\nIn the parenchymatous cortex large secretory canals (fig. 518, B) are\r\na conspicuous feature, and accessory cortical steles similar to those\r\nin _Cycas_ occasionally occur (fig. 511). The large pith consists of\r\nparenchyma and secretory canals, and internal periderm[1106] may be\r\npresent; no medullary bundles have been discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 509. _Cycadeoidea Wielandi._ Tangential section\r\nof secondary xylem of the stem.

(After Wieland; × 4.)]\r\n\r\nThe correlation of the numerous fronds[1107] preserved in Mesozoic\r\nstrata with their parent-stems is seldom possible. It is known that\r\nleaves of the _Zamites_ type were borne on stems (_Bucklandia_)\r\nagreeing with _Cycadeoidea_ in certain features but differing in the\r\nhabit of the fertile shoots (fig. 542), and there is evidence that\r\nsimilar stems bore _Ptilophyllum_ and _Dictyozamites_ fronds[1108];\r\nbut only unexpanded leaves have been found in actual connexion with\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ stems. Wieland[1109] discovered young pinnate fronds,\r\nagreeing in the form of the pinnae with _Zamites_ and with some forms\r\nof _Encephalartos_, embedded in a thick mass of ramental scales in the\r\nterminal bud of a stem: the rachises were erect and the two-ranked\r\npinnae imbricate and folded inwards (fig. 512), the vernation being\r\nlike that of _Dioon_ and not circinate as in _Cycas_ and Ferns. The\r\nmesophyll of the leathery pinnae is differentiated into palisade\r\nand lacunar parenchyma, and the bundles are said to be ‘mesarch’\r\nthough on this point more information is desirable. Each bundle is\r\nsurrounded by a sheath of thick-walled cells and the same tissue\r\nforms =I=-shaped girders as in similar recent leaves. In one species,\r\n_Cycadella ramentosa_[1110], the rachis of a young frond found among\r\nthe leaf-bases had a broad U-shaped vascular strand.\r\n\r\nIn most _Cycadeoidea_ stems a characteristic feature is the occurrence\r\nof reduced leaves, or bracts, arranged spirally about a cone which\r\nsometimes projects slightly beyond the general level of the persistent\r\nleaf-bases, or the cones may be fully developed yet still more or less\r\nhidden within the armour of petiole-bases (fig. 517, C). These cones,\r\nor flowers, are borne at the apex of lateral axillary shoots, and it\r\nis characteristic of the genus that they never project more than a\r\nvery short distance beyond the truncate stumps of the old leaf-bases.\r\nThe axis of a flowering branch bears numerous linear, hairy, bracts\r\n(figs. 513; 514, _b_) which with their thick felt of ramenta constitute\r\nan efficient protective investment. The summit of a fertile shoot\r\nforms a rounded hemispherical cushion (fig. 514), or the receptacle\r\nmay be more elongate and conical (fig. 513) and in some species\r\npyriform[1111]. The flowers are generally bisporangiate, but the fact\r\nthat in flowers with mature microsporophylls the ovules are small and\r\napparently immature (fig. 513) makes it difficult to determine whether\r\nthe megasporophylls are merely immature or functionless as in the\r\nmale flower of _Welwitschia_ (cf. fig. 818). It would seem, however,\r\nthat in most cases the flowers were bisexual[1112] (fig. 513). A\r\nremarkable feature is the enormous number of flowers on a single stem;\r\nin _Cycadeoidea Dartoni_[1113], 54 cm. long and 35 cm. broad, 500–600\r\nflowers were counted on one side. On the other hand the large stem of\r\n_C. gigantea_ (fig. 536) shows no flowers. All the flowers on a single\r\ntrunk are approximately in the same stage of development: it would\r\nseem, as Wieland points out, that after a vegetative period of some\r\nconsiderable duration the plant produced a large crop of flowers, and\r\nit is conceivable that as in _Corypha_ and some other recent Flowering\r\nplants this supreme effort set a limit to the plant’s existence. In\r\nthe development of flowers from the old stem _Cycadeoidea_ affords a\r\nstriking example of cauliflory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 513. _Cycadeoidea._ Restoration of an unexpanded\r\nbisporangiate strobilus with some of the hairy bracts removed. Compare\r\n_Cycadeoidea dacotensis_, figs. 529, 530. (After Wieland; _ca_ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 514. Ovulate strobilus of _Cycadeoidea_.\r\nLongitudinal section showing the pith, _m_, stele, _x_, _p_, and\r\ncortex, _c_, of the stem, the ovulate strobilus with bracts, _b_,\r\nseeds, _s_, etc., enclosed by foliage-leaves, _l_; _a_, insertion of\r\nleaves on the stem; _d_, insertion of disc of microsporophylls. (After\r\nWieland.)]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the flowers is one of the most obvious differences\r\nbetween _Cycadeoidea_ and recent Cycads (_cf._ figs. 393, 394).\r\nThe bisexual flowers of the fossil stems are comparatively small,\r\nnot exceeding a few centimetres in length, like a hen’s egg or a\r\nmedium-sized pear and in marked contrast to the male and female\r\ncones of modern Cycads (_cf._ figs. 393, 394). A verticil of pinnate\r\nmicrosporophylls is attached by a circular collar formed of the\r\nconcrescent bases of the sporophylls to the lower portion of the\r\nreceptacle; each pinnule bears several shortly-stalked synangia\r\ndivided into loculi containing microspores usually with smooth walls\r\nand similar, except in their larger size, to those of modern Cycads\r\n(fig. 532). Sections of some microspores figured by Wieland[1114]\r\nshow what appear to be cells in the spore-cavity, but they are larger\r\nthan ordinary prothallial cells and their true nature is doubtful. We\r\nlack information both as regards the nature of the male gametes and\r\nthe tissue formed on the germination of the spores. The free portions\r\nof the microsporophyll-whorl may consist of as many as 20 pinnate\r\nsporophylls, but the number is generally smaller; these are much longer\r\nthan the ovulate part of the flower and in an immature state the ends\r\nof the sporophylls are bent inwards and downwards (fig. 513) between\r\nthe bracts and the receptacle. After expanding and shedding the spores\r\nthe whole male disc is thrown off leaving a narrow rim below the\r\nhemispherical or conical receptacle (fig. 514, _d_). The sterile distal\r\nend of a microsporophyll is generally slightly expanded and spathulate;\r\nin _C. colossalis_[1115] it bears a pair of wing-like appendages (fig.\r\n533).\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the receptacle is covered with two kinds of organs\r\nwhich together form a layer of uniform depth; these are believed to be\r\nhomologous, foliar structures; the majority are sterile and have the\r\nform of slender long and narrow appendages (fig. 514) each normally\r\nwith a single axial vascular strand. These so-called interseminal\r\nscales increase in breadth in the apical region and form polygonal\r\nsummits less than a millimetre in breadth or exceeding 2 mm. The\r\nlow pyramidal apices of the interseminal scales give a mosaic-like\r\nappearance to the surface of the ovulate receptacle (fig. 515). In\r\nthe lower part of the receptacle these sterile sporophylls are the\r\nonly appendages, but over the greater part of the receptacle they\r\nare intermixed with a smaller number of similar appendages which\r\nbear a single terminal orthotropous ovule (fig. 514, _s_). Each\r\novule-bearing organ or megasporophyll (seed-stalk) is surrounded by\r\n5—6 interseminal scales, and the narrow cylindrical micropylar tubes\r\nare readily distinguished from the sterile sporophylls in surface-view\r\n(figs. 516, 564). The seeds appear to be exalbuminous and the embryo\r\nis dicotyledonous (figs. 516, 521, 523)[1116]. The seeds are very\r\nsmall in comparison with those of living Cycads. The structure of\r\nthe megasporophylls, both sterile and fertile, is described in more\r\ndetail in the account of _Cycadeoidea Morierei_ and other forms. Fig.\r\n516 represents a longitudinal section of one of the smallest seeds\r\nof _Cycadeoidea_, between 3 and 4 mm. long; an embryo occupies the\r\ngreater part of the seed-cavity: the micropylar tube is formed of\r\nthree layers, a strong inner palisade-layer, a thin middle layer, and\r\nan outer palisade-tissue, the interior of the tube being filled with\r\nparenchyma; at the shoulder of the seed above the root-end of the\r\nembryo the surface of the testa is characterised by 5–6 wings formed\r\nby the radial extension of palisade-cells. After the shedding of the\r\nspores and the abscission of the microsporophylls the flowering shoot\r\nprobably increased slightly in length, thus pushing the ripening seeds\r\nbeyond the ends of the surrounding leaf-bases. The ripe flowers were\r\neventually cut off by an absciss-layer immediately below the receptacle\r\n(figs. 521, C, _a_; 522, _a_), large cup-like depressions being left\r\non the surface of the stem (fig. 534). The ovulate cone on which the\r\nspecies _Cycadeoidea Morierei_ is founded probably represents the\r\ncondition of a naturally detached flower of a _Cycadeoidea_. It is\r\npossible that the detached flowers freed from their encircling bracts\r\nmay have been edible, the small seeds being dispersed by animal agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 515. _Cycadeoidea_ sp. Surface-view of a young\r\novulate strobilus showing the swollen ends of interseminal scales\r\ngrouped about the circular micropyles. (After Wieland; × 10.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 516. _Cycadeoidea Dartoni._ Longitudinal section\r\nof seed with embryo. (After Wieland; × 19.)]\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe splendid petrified stem, _Cycadeoidea etrusca_ Cap.[1117], one\r\nof the treasures of the Bologna Museum, was found on a tomb 20 miles\r\nwest of that city where it was doubtless placed by the Etruscans\r\nwho obtained it from the Upper Jurassic scaly clays in the Apennine\r\nHills. It was in an imperfectly preserved flower of this fossil\r\nthat Graf Solms-Laubach discovered some microspores, but it was not\r\nuntil Wieland’s examination of the more complete American stems that\r\ninformation was obtained as to the spore-bearing organs. Another\r\nItalian stem, _Cycadeoidea montiana_ Cap., was described in 1753 as\r\na ‘congeries of barnacles[1118].’ The specimen named by Goeppert\r\n_Raumeria Reichenbachiana_[1119] was described in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century as a mass of _Hippurites_ or coral cups: this\r\nwas found in a swamp in Galicia and is now one of the most striking\r\nobjects in the Dresden Museum; a brief account of it is given on page\r\n409. In 1859 Tyson discovered two large trunks in the Potomac beds of\r\nMaryland for which Fontaine subsequently proposed the name _Tysonia\r\nmarylandica_[1120], but as Ward pointed out the species is clearly a\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ (fig. 507). In 1894 Lester Ward[1121] recorded several\r\nadditional stems from Tyson’s locality. It is, however, from the Black\r\nHills of Dakota, an isolated spur of the Rocky Mountains, formed of\r\nolder rocks encircled by Lower Cretaceous strata[1122], that the\r\ngreatest number of Cycadean trunks have been obtained: the magnificent\r\ncollection now in the Yale Museum is largely due to the energy and\r\nmunificence of the late Prof. Marsh. From the Upper Jurassic beds in\r\nCarbon Co., Wyoming[1123], several stems have been collected, and a\r\npreliminary study of their external features led Ward to institute 20\r\nspecies of a new genus _Cycadella_. Stems have also been discovered\r\nin the Freezout Hills of Wyoming and additional specimens have been\r\nfound in the Potomac formation of Maryland. The discovery of over\r\n1000 specimens of Cycadean stems in the Lower Cretaceous and Upper\r\nJurassic beds of a few localities in the United States bears striking\r\ntestimony to the abundance of these extinct Gymnosperms during the\r\nlatter part of the Mesozoic era. It is perhaps true that, as Lester\r\nWard wrote, ‘Cycads are to the vegetable kingdom what Dinosaurs are\r\nto the animal, each representing the culmination in Mesozoic times of\r\nthe ruling Dynasties in the life of their age[1124].’ Although the\r\nnumber of stems obtained from European countries is relatively small,\r\nthe abundance of specimens in the Upper Jurassic strata of the Isle\r\nof Portland and Northern Italy and their occurrence in Belgium[1125],\r\nFrance, Germany, Austria, Poland, India and elsewhere, together with\r\nan abundance of Cycadean fronds in practically all Jurassic and Lower\r\nCretaceous plant-bearing beds, demonstrate the dominant position of\r\nthe Bennettitales. The occurrence of the genus _Williamsonia_ in\r\nmany European localities as well as in India, Afghanistan, and other\r\ncountries, and the not infrequent occurrence of stems assigned to\r\n_Bucklandia_, _Yatesia_, _Cylindropodium_, and other genera furnish\r\nevidence of the rich development of the Bennettitales in later Jurassic\r\nand Lower Cretaceous floras. Wieland’s recent discovery[1126] of\r\nnumerous Cycadean fronds, _Williamsonia_ flowers, and stems in Liassic\r\nrocks in Mexico shows that the group had already assumed an important\r\nposition in the early part of the Jurassic period.\r\n\r\nThe memoir by Carruthers[1127] on British Cycadean stems contains the\r\nfirst account of the morphological features of Bennettitalean flowers\r\nbased on petrified material. In 1891 Solms-Laubach contributed an\r\nimportant paper on the Bennettitean flower and several years later\r\nLignier[1128] contributed additional data derived from a careful\r\nstudy of a well preserved strobilus[1129] from the Gault of Normandy.\r\nWieland’s researches[1130] added very greatly to our knowledge,\r\nparticularly with regard to the morphology of the microsporophylls.\r\nAmong the earlier descriptions of the reproductive organs of the\r\nBennettitales is Buckland’s account[1131] of a specimen from the\r\nInferior Oolite of Charmouth, Dorset (fig. 560), which he referred to\r\nthe genus _Podocarya_ (= _Williamsonia Bucklandi_[1132]): a thorough\r\nexamination of the type-specimen, which unfortunately cannot be found,\r\nwould probably furnish many important facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n{ _Cycadeoidea_ (_Bennettites_) _Gibsoniana_ (_Carruthers_).\r\n{ _Cycadeoidea_ (_Bennettites_) _Saxbyana_ (_Brown_).\r\n\r\nThese two species serve to illustrate the type of stem for which\r\nCarruthers instituted the tribe Bennettiteae and the genus\r\n_Bennettites_. _Bennettites Gibsonianus_ is the most important of the\r\nfive species described by Carruthers[1133], as it was from its fertile\r\nshoots that information was first obtained as to the nature of the\r\novulate strobili of the Bennettitales. _B. Saxbyanus_[1134], originally\r\ndescribed as _Cycadites Saxbyanus_ from a specimen found by Mr Saxby\r\nat Bonchurch in the Isle of Wight and represented by Wealden examples\r\nfrom Brook Point, is chiefly interesting for the clear preservation\r\nof the anatomical features of the stem. Three other species were also\r\ndescribed by Carruthers; they are: _Bennettites maximus_ Carr., a large\r\nstem similar to _B. Saxbyanus_, in the Museum of the Geological Survey;\r\n_B. portlandicus_ from the Lower Purbeck of the Isle of Portland, in\r\nthe collection of the Geological Society; and _B. Peachianus_, a piece\r\nof a compressed stem, in the British Museum, from the Upper Jurassic of\r\nHelmsdale in N.E. Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 517. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ A, transverse\r\nsection of petiole showing vascular bundles and ramenta; B, portion of\r\nA enlarged showing periderm and ramenta. C, tangential section of stem\r\nwith leaf-bases, ramenta (black) and two flowers, 1, 2. (A, slightly\r\nenlarged, Manchester Collection, R, 1069; C, after Carruthers.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Gibsoniana._\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on a petrified portion of a large stem of\r\nLower Greensand age discovered by Mr Gibson in Luccomb Chine in the\r\nIsle of Wight: the type-specimen is represented by pieces of the\r\noriginal block in the British Museum and in one of the Museums at the\r\nRoyal Gardens, Kew. The following description is based partly on the\r\npublished accounts and in part on an examination of sections in the\r\nBritish Museum, the Manchester University Museum, and in Dr Scott’s\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe elliptical form of the stem and vascular cylinder as seen in\r\ntransverse section, regarded by Carruthers[1135] as a feature\r\ncharacteristic of the genus, has no morphological significance and is\r\nin part at least due to compression. In the large pith, the armour of\r\npersistent petiole-bases separated by dense ramental scales (fig. 517,\r\nA, B), and in habit, _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ agrees generally with\r\nthe stems of many recent Cycads, but the resemblance of the vegetative\r\norgans is in marked contrast to the differences exhibited by the\r\nreproductive shoots. The pith consists of parenchyma with scattered\r\nsecretory ducts but no medullary vascular bundles. In the pith of\r\n_Cycadeoidea Peachiana_ there are patches of tissue superficially\r\nresembling vascular strands, but these are probably bands of internal\r\nphloem like those described by Solms-Laubach[1136] in some Italian\r\nstems. In none of the English stems are there any clear indications of\r\nthe occurrence of more than one cambium in the stele. The secondary\r\nxylem is entirely centrifugal with some smaller crushed elements,\r\npresumably protoxylem, at the inner edge where the medullary rays are\r\nespecially broad. The xylem is of the manoxylic type (fig. 518, A)\r\nas in recent Cycads; though the medullary rays, 1–2 cells broad, are\r\nrather smaller than in recent species. The tracheids are scalariform\r\nas in _Stangeria_ (fig. 397). As in recent Cycads there is a broad\r\ncylinder of secondary phloem (fig. 518, B)[1137] composed of alternate\r\nlayers of thick-walled and thinner elements—sieve-tubes and parenchyma:\r\ntraces of lateral sieve-plates occur on some of the elongated elements.\r\nEach leaf-trace arises as a single strand from the lower edge of a mesh\r\nformed by the large inner end of a medullary ray: on emerging into\r\nthe inner cortex the trace has the form of a U-shaped strand (fig.\r\n519, A, _lt_) which passes direct to the petiole, following a steeply\r\nascending course in _Cycadeoidea Saxbyana_ and almost horizontal in _C.\r\nGibsoniana_. Before entering the base of a leaf the trace breaks up\r\ninto several collateral strands and these form a simple pattern as\r\nseen in a tangential section of the leaf-bases (fig. 517, A, C), the\r\ncentral bundles on the upper side forming a U-shaped involution. There\r\nis no indication of any girdling of the foliar bundles. The arrangement\r\nof the petiolar bundles is simpler and more Fern-like than in the\r\nmajority of existing Cycads. Each vascular bundle consists in the\r\npetiole-base mainly of centrifugal secondary xylem and medullary-ray\r\ntissue (fig. 519, B); a group of centripetal tracheids is usually\r\nrecognisable internal to the protoxylem: the structure is of the\r\nmesarch type with a variable amount of centripetal xylem, and agrees\r\ngenerally with that in recent Cycads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 518. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ A, secondary xylem\r\nof stem; B, secondary phloem and part of the cortex with secretory\r\nducts, _s_. (A, B, British Museum, 13206.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 519. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ A, transverse\r\nsection of the vascular cylinder of stem, with leaf-trace, _lt_; _c_,\r\ncambium, _px_, protoxylem. B, vascular bundle of petiole. (British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\nThe comparatively narrow cortex is composed of parenchyma with\r\nscattered secretory sacs (fig. 518, B, _s_), and occasionally an\r\nelliptical vascular strand (fig. 511) is present which is probably\r\ncauline as are the similar strands in _Cycas_. The persistent\r\npetiole-bases are covered with ramental scales which form a dense\r\ninterfoliar packing: these frequently consist of a single layer of\r\nfairly thick-walled cells or, as seen in transverse section, of\r\nspindle-like scales one-cell thick at the edges and 2–3 cells broad in\r\nthe middle (fig. 517, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 520. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ Ground-tissue of\r\nbract. (British Museum. 41388.)]\r\n\r\nThe presence of fertile shoots, presumably axillary, is one of the most\r\nstriking features of Bennettitean stems. The branching is monopodial\r\nand not sympodial as in most recent Cycads. The nearest approach to\r\nthe method of branching in _Cycadeoidea_ is afforded by some stems\r\nof _Macrozamia_ recently described by Chamberlain[1138]. It is not\r\nimprobable that some of the flowering branches of _Cycadeoidea_\r\nwere branched. Solms-Laubach[1139] states that he observed certain\r\ncharacters in the secondary axes of _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ which led\r\nhim to suspect that there may have been fascicled systems of fertile\r\nshoots emerging in a body or in close proximity to one another between\r\nthe leaf-bases of the stem. An example of a branched flowering shoot\r\nis described in _Williamsonia scotica_[1140]. A fertile shoot agrees\r\nin structure with the main axis and Scott[1141] states that the phloem\r\nis particularly well developed, a feature by no means unusual in\r\nfertile branches. These lateral shoots (fig. 514) bear numerous linear\r\nbracts each with three collateral vascular bundles, and ground-tissue\r\ncomposed of thick-walled cells characterised by scalariform pitting\r\n(fig. 520): secretory sacs are abundant. The hypodermal stereome is\r\nespecially developed on the inner face of the bracts. The apex of a\r\nlateral shoot has the form of a rounded cushion (figs. 514; 521, A, C)\r\nsimilar to the receptacle of many Composites, and on this are borne the\r\nsporophylls. It is characteristic of _Cycadeoidea_ that the flowers\r\nproject very slightly beyond the surface of the stem and the peduncles\r\nare not exposed except in tangential sections through the leaf-base\r\narmour (fig. 517, C, 1, 2). On the fall of the flower or ripe ‘fruit,’\r\nwhich is effected by an absciss-layer (figs. 521, C, _a_; 522, _a_),\r\na cup-like scar is left on the stem (_cf._ fig. 534). This method of\r\nflower-production suggests comparison, _mutatis mutandis_, with the\r\nphenomenon of cauliflory in certain recent Flowering plants; it is one\r\nof the distinguishing features between _Cycadeoidea_ and stems bearing\r\nlonger fertile shoots with flowers of the _Williamsonia_ type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 521. _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Gibsoniana._\r\nA, C, longitudinal sections; _a_, absciss-layer; _b_, bracts; _pr_,\r\n‘pericarp’; _s_, scales, sterile and fertile.

These\r\norgans are believed to be homologous foliar structures, the seed-stalks\r\nbeing megasporophylls and the interseminal scales abortive or potential\r\nsporophylls (see also figs. 562, 563). Fig. 514 shows the form of a\r\nsingle flower from an American stem closely allied to _Cycadeoidea\r\nGibsoniana_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 522. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ Longitudinal\r\nsection of flower showing half the receptacle with part of the\r\nabsciss-layer, _a_. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 523. _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana._ Seed with embryo.\r\n(British Museum, 41388.)]\r\n\r\nThe megasporophylls are more or less polygonal in transverse section:\r\nthere is a central concentric vascular strand surrounded by a thick\r\ncortex (fig. 527): at its upper end the sporophyll bears a single\r\northotropous seed containing a dicotyledonous embryo (figs. 521, D, E;\r\n523). The vascular strand pierces the base of the testa and expands\r\nto form a shallow cup of tracheal tissue in the chalaza; there are no\r\nbundles in the single integument. The testa (fig. 521, D, _t_) consists\r\nof three regions, a median layer of rather large rectangular or\r\npalisade-cells with an inner and outer tissue composed of much smaller\r\ncells. The testa is prolonged distally as a slender cylindrical column\r\nor micropylar tube at the base of which it becomes broader owing to\r\nthe increase in breadth of the middle or palisade layer. A nucellar\r\nbeak projects as a cone into the base of the micropylar tube. No\r\npollen-chamber has been found. It is noteworthy that the micropyle is\r\nclosed in the ripe seeds. Internal to the testa there is a crushed\r\nmembrane separated from the embryo by a space (fig. 521, D, _sp_): this\r\nis the remains of the nucellus and, as Solms-Laubach points out, there\r\nis no proof that any endosperm was present in the ripe seeds[1142].\r\nThe embryo consists of a short axis, the conical radicle and the very\r\nshort apex of the epicotyl, also two equal cotyledons each with a\r\nfew vascular bundles (fig. 521, D). The long interseminal scales, as\r\nseen in transverse section in the lower part of a flower between the\r\nsporophylls, appear as compressed polygonal organs (fig. 521, B, _i_)\r\nwith an axial vascular strand surrounded by parenchyma and limited by\r\na strong epidermis; they pass up between the seed-stalks, _m_, and in\r\nthe distal end become considerably enlarged (figs. 514, 515), gradually\r\nexpanding to form a truncate or slightly pyramidal apex (figs. 553,\r\n563). The swollen peltate apices of adjacent scales form a continuous\r\ncovering to the flower interrupted, except in the lower sterile part\r\nof the flower, by symmetrically disposed cylindrical micropylar tubes\r\n(fig. 515). The peripheral interseminal scales form a homogeneous\r\nparenchymatous tissue which springs from below the edge of the\r\nreceptacle (fig. 521, A, B, _pr_) and the individuality of the scales\r\ncomposing this ‘pericarp’ is indicated by occasional invaginations of\r\nthe epidermal layer which marks the boundary of the polygonal areas.\r\nThe structure of the megasporophylls and scales is more fully described\r\nin the case of _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Morierei_[1143].\r\n\r\nThe flowers of _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ appear to be unisexual and\r\novulate: in view of the discovery by Wieland of numerous bisexual\r\nfertile shoots on American species of _Cycadeoidea_ it would be\r\nreasonable to regard the apparently unisexual flowers of the English\r\nspecies as originally bisexual but preserved at a stage subsequent to\r\nthe loss, by abscission, of the disc of microsporophylls. Fig. 514\r\nshows a flower of an American _Cycadeoidea_ practically identical with\r\nthose of _C. Gibsoniana_, but the remains of the staminate disc are\r\nclearly seen at _d_ below the swollen apex of the flowering axis. In\r\nthe photograph of half of the same region in _C. Gibsoniana_ reproduced\r\nin fig. 522 there is no indication of any similar trace of a whorl of\r\nmicrosporophylls. Admitting the fact that a shrivelled remnant of the\r\npersistent base of a whorl of microsporophylls might easily escape\r\nobservation, it is difficult to believe that any fertile leaves ever\r\nexisted in the flower represented in figs. 521, 522. It is equally\r\ndifficult to regard the specimen represented in fig. 561 as other than\r\na true unisexual (ovulate) flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Morierei_ (Saporta and Marion).\r\n\r\nThe name _Bennettites_ was adopted by Lignier for this species which\r\nwas founded on a detached flower from the Gault[1144] of Vaches-Noires,\r\nNormandy. It was first described by Morière[1145], then by Saporta and\r\nMarion[1146], who named it _Williamsonia Morierei_, and it has since\r\nbeen thoroughly investigated by Lignier[1147]. There is no evidence as\r\nto the nature of the parent-stem though Morière suggested a possible\r\nconnexion with _Zamia Brongniarti_ Mor. (figured by Saporta[1148]\r\nas _Fittonia Brongniarti_) from the same locality. There can be no\r\nreasonable doubt that _Bennettites Morierei_ was borne on a lateral\r\nbranch of a stem of the _Cycadeoidea_ type: it is constructed on\r\nessentially the same plan as the flowers of _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites)\r\nGibsoniana_, and in both cases there is no indication of the presence\r\nof microsporophylls. The type-specimen is 5·5 cm. long and 3·5\r\ncm. broad, ovoid, and characterised by a depressed cushion-like\r\nreceptacle as in _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_. The enveloping bracts\r\nwith their ramental scales agree generally in structure with those\r\nof the English species and, except as regards the ramenta, with\r\n_Williamsonia scotica_: numerous stomata occur on the lower surface;\r\nthe ground-tissue consists of thick-walled parenchyma and the narrow\r\npit-canals simulate the scalariform bands in _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_\r\n(_cf._ fig. 520). The pitted sclerous cells in the bracts of _W.\r\nscotica_ are of the same type. There is an anastomosing system of\r\nsecretory canals, also several vascular bundles like those in _C.\r\nGibsoniana_ but more numerous; the latter are composed of a group of\r\nphloem-elements abutting externally on fibres, a well-defined cambium,\r\nand radially disposed scalariform tracheids: internal to the protoxylem\r\nis a group of elements considered by Lignier to be centripetal xylem.\r\nFrom the branching and slightly divergent course of the bundles in the\r\nupper part of the bracts Lignier concluded that these organs represent\r\nthe basal portions of leaves originally provided with a terminal limb.\r\nIt may be that the small lateral appendages to some of the bracts of\r\n_Williamsonia scotica_ (fig. 561, _l_) afford support to this view.\r\n\r\n_Megasporophylls_ (seed-stalks and seeds). These organs, 3–4·5 cm. long\r\nand approximately 1·5 mm. in diameter, are in most cases imperfectly\r\npreserved. In transverse section and at a level of 1 cm. above the\r\nreceptacle a stalk bearing an atrophied seed shows the following\r\nfeatures: an epidermis with very thick internal walls encloses a\r\nparenchymatous ground-tissue with an axial conducting strand. At a\r\nhigher level the epidermal cells have walls of uniform thickness, and\r\na hypodermal layer of cells with coloured contents is differentiated\r\nfrom the ground-tissue (fig. 524, D, _ac_). As the seed-base is\r\napproached the epidermal cells tend to separate from one another and\r\ndivide longitudinally, the compact epidermal layer being replaced\r\nby an envelope of tubular, dissociated, cells (fig. 524, D, _Et_).\r\nSimilar tubular elements occur in the seed-stalks of _Cycadeoidea\r\nGibsoniana_. A fully developed seed-stalk bearing a complete seed cut\r\nacross in the middle region shows the following features: a concentric\r\nvascular strand surrounded by thin-walled parenchyma and the coloured\r\nhypodermal layer (fig. 524, D, _ac_), the whole being enclosed in the\r\ntubular envelope of epidermal origin (_Et_) which is more strongly\r\ndeveloped than in the stalks of imperfect seeds: there may be as many\r\nas 10–12 tubular cells on one radius. When traced downwards towards\r\nthe receptacle the tubular envelope decreases in breadth, though\r\nthe cells become more numerous and smaller, until in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the receptacle the tubular tissue is transformed into\r\na compact parenchyma of large cells each of which corresponds to a\r\ngroup of tubes formed by the septation of the cells. Traced upwards\r\nthis thin-walled parenchyma gradually passes into thick-walled tubes,\r\nand near the seed-base the tubular envelope is reduced to two layers,\r\nan inner consisting of relatively small cells with sinuous radial walls\r\n(the folded layer of Lignier) and an outer tubular layer. Lignier\r\ndescribes an interesting abnormality, a bifid seed-stalk enclosed in a\r\ncommon epidermis which he compares with the occasional branching of the\r\nseed-stalks of _Ginkgo biloba_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 524. _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Morierei._\r\n\r\n  A.

(From Prof.\r\n     Lignier’s drawings; A, B, D, × 118; C, × 90.)]\r\n\r\n_Seeds._ The seeds (figs. 525, 526), 6–7 × 2·5–3 mm., are tetragonal or\r\npentagonal in the upper half (fig. 527, 1, 2), the angles being formed\r\nby thick but not very prominent wings of tissue (fig. 524, C, _cf_);\r\nthey are orthotropous and have a single integument (figs. 525, 526).\r\nThe tubular layer forming the outer portion of a seed-stalk near the\r\nseed-base is prolonged over the surface of the testa as a discontinuous\r\ncovering in the form of isolated or small groups of tubes, giving a\r\nstriated appearance to the seeds. This layer though apparently a part\r\nof the seed is derived from the neighbouring interseminal scales of\r\nwhich it is the epidermal layer; it consists of elongated cells and\r\nscattered stomata[1149]. The folded layer persists only in the lower\r\npart of the seed, being replaced by a layer of radially extended cells\r\n(radial layer; _ar_, figs. 524, C; 525, _ar_; 527, _c_) in the upper\r\nregion of the seed. In the micropylar region both the tubular and\r\nfolded layers undergo further change; the external, tubular, layer\r\nforms a kind of epidermis (_at_, figs. 524, 525), the subepidermal\r\nlayer, consisting of the radially elongated cells (figs. 524, 525,\r\n_ar_; 527, _c_). The superficial layer assumes a different aspect in\r\nthe micropylar region, its cells being thicker walled, as are also\r\nthose of the subepidermal layer (fig. 524, A and B). The micropylar\r\ncanal (figs. 524, 525, _cm_) is cylindrical in the lower part but at\r\nthe apex is reduced to a long and narrow slit bounded by an internal\r\nepidermis of radially stretched cells which in the lower portion of\r\nthe tube are thinner walled and isodiametric. The rest of the testa is\r\ndifferentiated into two regions; an outer fleshy region immediately\r\ninternal to the folded (or radial) layer and an inner fibrous region\r\nnext the nucellus, which is one-layer broad between the wings but\r\nopposite the wings it extends radially outwards across the fleshy\r\ntissue to the radial layer (figs. 524, C; 525; 527): in the winged\r\nportion of the seed this tissue forms the inner fibrous portion of the\r\nwings but in the lower part of the seed below the wings it forms a\r\nsingle layer of uniform breadth finally spreading out as a basal cup\r\nin the chalazal region where it is pierced by the vascular strand. The\r\nfleshy portion of the testa forms one layer in the proximal part of\r\nthe seed and becomes several layers wide between the fibrous wings\r\nin the upper part. This fleshy tissue appears to be derived from the\r\ncoloured, subepidermal, layer of the seed-stalk, while the internal\r\nparenchyma is regarded by Lignier as the equivalent of the fibrous\r\nlayer of the testa. In the micropylar tube the fibrous layers are\r\nreplaced by 2–3 layers of sclerous cells (fig. 524, A, B). The testa\r\nhas no vascular supply: the concentric strand of the seed-stalk passes\r\nthrough the fibrous tissue at the base of the seed and reaches the\r\nbase of the nucellus (fig. 525). The nucellar apex extends into the\r\nlower part of the micropyle (fig. 525, _n_), and in some cases Lignier\r\nnoticed an axial canal formed by the breaking-down of the cells which\r\nabutted below on a cavity above the embryo, probably the remains of\r\na pollen-chamber (figs. 525, 527). No microspores have been found.\r\nTwo dark spots shown at _co_, fig. 525, may represent archegonia but\r\nthis is doubtful, especially as the seed contains a well-developed\r\nembryo. The nucellus is free from the testa only in the apical region\r\nand a dicotyledonous embryo occupies the interior without any trace of\r\nendosperm. Lignier points out that in some seeds containing embryos the\r\nnucellar beak is not completely perforated: in this fact and in the\r\nabsence of microspores in the micropylar canals he is inclined to see\r\nevidence of parthenogenesis[1150].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 525. _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Morierei._\r\nSection of a seed and adjacent interseminal scales. _tm_, micropylar\r\ntube; _n_, nucellar beak in the micropylar canal, _cm_; _cp_,\r\npollen-chamber; _co_, archegonia (?); _em_, position of the embryo;\r\n_ch_, chalaza; _dn_, remains of the nucellus; _af_, fibrous layer\r\npassing below into the shell, _cq_, and the peduncle, _Tf_; _tch_,\r\nfleshy layer; _ar_, radial and tubular layers represented in the\r\npeduncle by the tubular envelope _at_; _Ec_, swollen ends of the\r\ninterseminal scales.

(From a\r\nphotograph supplied by Prof. Lignier.)]\r\n\r\nIn several respects the seeds of _Cycadeoidea_ agree with those of\r\n_Gnetum_: reference should be made to the account of the seed of\r\n_Gnetum africanum_ in Chapter +lii.+ and to the papers referred to in\r\nthe footnote[1151].\r\n\r\n_Interseminal scales._ The young seed-stalks agree very closely\r\nwith the interseminal scales: each seed-stalk is surrounded by 5–6\r\nscales (fig. 527) as in other Bennettitean flowers (fig. 564).\r\nFor the greater part of their length the interseminal scales are\r\ncompressed, but above the seeds, where they are free from pressure\r\n(fig. 526), they become much thicker and form a covering (‘pericarp’)\r\nas in _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_. In its upper region an interseminal\r\nscale consists of an epidermis with strongly thickened inner walls,\r\nhypodermal thick-walled cells and parenchymatous ground-tissue with\r\na single axial bundle. In the lower part the scale is more flattened\r\nand the thick-walled hypoderm is replaced by thin-walled parenchyma.\r\nSome of the scales at the periphery of the receptacle where there are\r\nno seed-stalks are broader and may have six vascular bundles; this,\r\nLignier suggested, might be regarded as evidence of the reduction of\r\nthe interseminal scales from leaves possessing a terminal limb; but a\r\nfurther examination of scales at the periphery of the flower led him\r\nto the conclusion that the distal swelling of the scales is solely due\r\nto the hypertrophy of conjunctive tissue and is not the result of the\r\nmodification of a reduced limb[1152]. The morphological value of the\r\ninterseminal scales and seed-stalks has not been definitely settled,\r\nthough the probability is that they are homologous organs and foliar.\r\nSolms-Laubach[1153] suggested that both may be axial, the seed-stalks\r\nrepresenting axes ending in a flower reduced to a single ovule; or,\r\nhe adds, the seed-stalks may just as well be carpels, though in that\r\ncase we should have the unusual phenomenon of terminal seeds. The\r\ninterseminal scales may be aborted seed-stalks crushed between the\r\nlatter; or if the seed-stalks are axes, the scales may be foliar. He is\r\ninclined to see in the scales the bracts and prophylls of seed-stalks\r\nto which must be added such bracteoles, preceding the seed or flower,\r\nas may happen to spring from the seed-stalks. Pearson[1154], on the\r\nassumption that the seed-stalks are axial structures, institutes a\r\ncomparison between _Welwitschia_ and _Bennettites_ and regards each\r\nflower of _Welwitschia_ as a much reduced Bennettitean strobilus.\r\nLignier believes the interseminal scales to be leaves borne on the\r\nswollen apex (receptacle) of an axis of the second order, while the\r\nseed-stalks are fertile leaves of a unifoliar bud of the third order\r\npossibly axillary though not necessarily so to the interseminal scales.\r\nMy own view, influenced by the examination of the immature flower of\r\n_Williamsonia scotica_, is that the seed-stalks (megasporophylls) and\r\nscales are homologous, the former being sporophylls and the latter\r\nsterile foliage leaves, the whole flower, as Wettstein[1155] says,\r\nconsisting of a conical axis bearing numerous fertile and sterile\r\ncarpels enclosed by a perianth of bracts. Worsdell[1156], who shares\r\nČelakovsky’s opinion that sporophylls were originally radially\r\nsymmetrical organs bearing a terminal sporangium, regards the flowers\r\nof _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ and other species as more primitive\r\nthan those of recent Cycads: he does not see any justification for\r\nthe view that the Bennettitalean flowers are in advance of those of\r\nexisting Cycadean plants as regards a supposed tendency towards the\r\nAngiospermous type. He maintains that _Bennettites_ ‘shows absolutely\r\nno indication of such an advanced structure in its essential organs,\r\nthe sporophylls, which remain primitively radial in structure, bearing\r\nthe ovules in a terminal position.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 527. _Cycadeoidea Morierei._ Transverse section\r\nof interseminal scales and seeds near the apex of the latter; seeds 1\r\nand 2 show the pollen-chamber, _a_; the fibrous layer, _b_, forming\r\nwings and extending across the fleshy tissue; _c_, the radial layer;\r\nseeds 3 and 4 are aborted. (After Lignier.)\r\n\r\nThe letters _a_, _b_, _c_, in this figure correspond to _cp_, _cf_, and\r\n_ar_ in figs. 525, 526.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea dacotensis_ (McBride).\r\n\r\nMcBride[1157] first described this Lower Cretaceous species from the\r\nBlack Hills of South Dakota as _Bennettites dacotensis_, the generic\r\nname _Cycadeoidea_ being adopted by Ward[1158] who distinguished\r\nsome of McBride’s specimens as _Cycadeoidea McBridei_. The stem is\r\nelliptical in section, 32 cm. long and 45 cm. in girth: owing to the\r\npartial decay of the petiole-bases the ramental reticulum forms a\r\nprominent feature. Numerous flowers, all of which are approximately\r\nat the same stage of development, project like conical buttons above\r\nthe general level of the stem-surface[1159]. The bisporangiate flowers\r\nconsist of a conical receptacle bearing interseminal scales and\r\nmegasporophylls, the whole being surrounded by spirally disposed\r\nbracts (fig. 529). A whorl of 18 or 19 nearly mature microsporophylls\r\nis attached to the base of the receptacle (figs. 528, 530); each\r\nmicrosporophyll has a strong rachis extending beyond the apex of the\r\nflower-axis and bent inwards and downwards with the distal end tucked\r\nbetween the ascending rachis and the receptacle. The slender pinnules,\r\nin two alternate series, are bent downwards and bear synangia in rows.\r\nA transverse section just below the ovulate portion of the cone shows\r\na continuous ring of tissue encircling the receptacle with vascular\r\nbundles parallel to the surface (fig. 530, _A_, _m_); at a higher level\r\nthe bundles fall into groups preparatory to the breaking up of the\r\ndisc into separate microsporophylls. Immediately above the apex of the\r\ncentral cone the coherent basal portion of the verticil of sporophylls\r\nis replaced by the separate rachises which in section have the form\r\nof isosceles triangles (fig. 530, _B_). Each microsporophyll is\r\napproximately 10 cm. long; the longest pinnule being 1·5 cm. in length\r\nand bearing two lateral series of synangia, 10 in each row. At maturity\r\nthe microsporophylls probably spread out and the whole whorl was thrown\r\noff leaving an annular rim (fig. 514, _d_) such as is often seen at the\r\nbase of older ovulate strobili. The immaturity of the ovules in this\r\n(fig. 528) and other specimens led to the suggestion that the strobili\r\nof _Cycadeoidea_ were protandrous. The synangia (fig. 531) are several\r\ntimes broader than long and similar in size to those of the Fern\r\n_Marattia_. In each synangium are two rows of elongated loculi (fig.\r\n532) containing oval microspores usually with a smooth exine and rather\r\nlarger than those of recent Cycads. The synangium-wall is composed of a\r\npalisade-layer of thick-walled cells and a layer of smaller and thinner\r\ncells: the palisade-layer is narrowest at the apex where dehiscence\r\noccurs and broadest at the base where the hypodermal tissue is more\r\nabundant and forms a short thick pedicel. The two rows of loculi are\r\nbounded by flattened cells and there are 10–20 loculi in each of the\r\ntwo rows: dehiscence of the individual loculi occurs in the middle of\r\nthe inner wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 528. _Cycadeoidea dacotensis._ Longitudinal\r\nsection through a bisporangiate strobilus; _s_, folded microsporophylls\r\nwith synangia; _o_, receptacle bearing short megasporophylls and\r\ninterseminal scales; _a_, eroded surface of bracts; _r_, ramenta\r\nbetween the bracts and leaf-bases; _l_, leaf-base; _c_, cortex of stem;\r\n_t_, vascular cylinder of peduncle.

(After Wieland; × 40.)]\r\n\r\nThis Lower Cretaceous Black Hills species[1160] affords an admirable\r\nexample of a method of branching exhibited by some stems: as shown in\r\nWieland’s photographs[1161] there may be five or six large and massive\r\ntrunks all in the same stage of fructification, differing but little\r\nin size and forming a cluster resembling independent plants growing in\r\nclose proximity to one another. There is apparently no central or major\r\naxis and the habit is therefore very different from that of a branching\r\n_Bucklandia_. _Cycadeoidea Marshiana_ bore large ovulate pyriform\r\nstrobili projecting slightly beyond the leaf-bases; they are 5 cm. long\r\nwith a maximum diameter of 3·5 cm. and have an elongated receptacle\r\nbearing short scales and sporophylls. The apical bud of one of the\r\ntrunks shows particularly well in transverse section the dense ramental\r\npacking between the bud-scales[1162]. Similar clusters of short and\r\nthick trunks occur in _Cycadeoidea superba_ and other American species.\r\n\r\nIn the small bisporangiate flowers of this species[1163] the\r\nmicrosporophylls, 11 or 12 in the verticil, are characterised by\r\nthe presence of a ventral furrow which, as Wieland suggests, may be\r\ncomparable on a much simpler scale with the winged sporophylls of\r\n_Cycadeoidea colossalis_ (fig. 533). The disc splits up at a distance\r\nof 1 cm. above the apex of the receptacle into the microsporophylls,\r\neach of which is 5·5 cm. long and bears two rows of pinnules which\r\nin the middle region have a length of 1 cm.; a microsporophyll is\r\nelongate, elliptical, and acuminate. In this species as in some others\r\nthere is a brush of sterile scales at the apex of the receptacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea colossalis_ Ward.\r\n\r\nWieland[1164] has recently described some interesting features in the\r\nmicrosporophylls of a bisporangiate flower assigned to this Lower\r\nCretaceous species from the Black Hills illustrating a departure from\r\nthe usual type. The hairy bracts extend considerably above the apex\r\nof the flower-proper; in fig. 533, A, a transverse section above\r\nthe receptacle, they are shown grouped about a circle of V-shaped\r\nstructures, converging towards a central point, which are the sterile\r\nprolongations of the ten rachises of the free portions of the staminate\r\ndisc. Each rachis is divided by a deep ventral furrow into a pair\r\nof wings (fig. 533, B, C), and it is these pairs of wings that form\r\nthe V-shaped structures in fig. 533, A. The wings form a dome-like\r\ngroup above the flower-apex (fig. 533, D, E). The synangia are borne\r\nin two rows on the concrescent disc and on the free sporophylls,\r\nwhich in this type are much simpler than in other species and agree\r\nin the absence of pinnules with some forms of _Williamsonia_ (_cf._\r\nfig. 556). The receptacle is pyriform and bears very short scales and\r\nseed-stalks; from its apex several interseminal scales are prolonged\r\nas a terminal brush, a feature of interest in connexion with flowers\r\nof _Williamsonia_. Wieland compares the wings of the microsporophylls\r\nto the two horns on the distal surface of the corresponding organs of\r\n_Ceratozamia_ and draws a comparison between them and the canopy of\r\nsome Palaeozoic seeds, but it is doubtful whether homologies can be\r\nestablished between these elaborate sporophylls and the integuments of\r\nPteridosperm seeds[1165].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea Reichenbachiana_ (Goeppert).\r\n\r\nGoeppert referred this species to his genus _Raumeria_[1166], a generic\r\nname retained by Carruthers though, as Solms-Laubach[1167] points\r\nout, the abundance of lateral fertile shoots among the leaf-bases\r\nshows it to be essentially similar to _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_.\r\nThe type-specimen in the Dresden Museum is a splendid example of\r\na fossil cycadean stem; it is probably of Lower Cretaceous age,\r\nbut was found in Galicia as an isolated specimen. It consists of a\r\nportion of a cylindrical trunk similar in habit to _C. gigantea_,\r\n·5 met. high and about the same in diameter. The pith, according to\r\nSchuster[1168], is 13 cm. in diameter and the xylem 8 cm. broad. There\r\nare many flowering shoots some of which are represented by cup-like\r\ndepressions, the base of the cup consisting of the cylindrical axis\r\nand the sides bearing the impress of the encircling bracts (fig.\r\n534). Goeppert compared these lateral shoots with the buds frequently\r\nproduced on the stems of _Cycas_. It is interesting to find that some\r\nof the cups correspond very closely in size with _Williamsonia_\r\nflowers, another indication of the very close agreement between the\r\n_Williamsonia_ and _Bennettites_ types of strobili. Some flowers\r\nstill in place show 16 bipinnate microsporophylls that were petrified\r\nbefore the synangium-bearing fronds unfolded[1169]. The ramental\r\nscales and other tissues figured by Schuster are of the usual type. A\r\nsecond specimen found as a boulder in Silesia and named by Goeppert\r\n_Raumeria Schulziana_ may, as he suggests, be a younger example of _C.\r\nReichenbachiana_. Another Galician stem, probably also Lower Cretaceous\r\nin age, is described by Raciborski[1170] as _Cycadeoidea Niedźwiedzkii_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 533. _Cycadeoidea colossalis._ Diagrammatic\r\nrestorations of the bisporangiate flower.

(After Schuster, from a block kindly supplied by Prof.\r\nRothpletz.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea gigantea_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThis species is founded on a large stem from the Upper Purbeck series\r\nof the Isle of Portland[1171] where it was discovered in a shaly clay\r\n17 ft above the great Dirt bed which yielded the trunks described\r\nby Buckland and other authors (fig. 535). The stem (fig. 554) is 1\r\nmet. 18 cm. high and has a maximum diameter of 1 met. 7 cm. It is the\r\ntallest fossil Cycadean stem so far found in a single piece though\r\n_Cycadeoidea Jenneyana_ probably reached a greater height. The stem\r\nis elliptical in section (fig. 537), a form due in part at least\r\nto compression. The only tissues preserved are in the superficial\r\nregion of the persistent leaf-bases. As the result of decay before\r\nmineralisation many of the petiole-bases are represented by cavities or\r\nmeshes in a prominent reticulum of silicified ramental scales. Towards\r\nthe apex the leaf-bases are smaller and a conical bud surrounded by\r\nlinear scale-leaves occupies the summit: an irregular cap of ramental\r\nscales forms the apex of the terminal bud. In section the bud would no\r\ndoubt present an appearance like that shown in Wieland’s photograph\r\nof the terminal cone of _C. Marshiana_[1172]. There is a striking\r\nresemblance both in the ramental cap and in the form of the protective\r\nscales between the fossil stem and such a Cycad as _Encephalartos\r\nAltensteinii_[1173]. A remarkable feature of _C. gigantea_ is the\r\nabsence of any fertile shoots among the leaf-bases. In one tangential\r\nsection a small bud was found, but it affords no evidence of the\r\npresence of any reproductive organs. A similar bud is described by\r\nLignier[1174] in the stem of _C. micromyela_. The absence of lateral\r\nflowers is, however, hardly a sufficient reason for separating this\r\nstem generically from other species of _Cycadeoidea_: negative evidence\r\nin this case is of doubtful value. While it is possible that the\r\nstrobili were terminal as in most recent Cycads, it is more probable\r\nthat they were lateral. The surface-features, though not perfect,\r\nare for the most part sufficiently well preserved to enable one to\r\nrecognise the bract-encircled axes of strobili were any present. If as\r\nWieland believes, and he is probably correct, the production of flowers\r\nwas the culminating event in the life of these Cycadean plants, the\r\nabsence of fertile shoots is merely an expression of immaturity. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult to understand how lateral branches could find their\r\nway to the surface among the crowded and cork-covered leaf-bases of the\r\nstem. The absence of flowers may be due to some unfavourable external\r\nconditions. The petioles consist of parenchymatous ground-tissue with\r\nmany secretory sacs and in some cases twelve partially preserved\r\nvascular bundles: the xylem consists of radial rows of centrifugal\r\ntracheids and medullary rays, but it is not possible to say whether\r\nany centripetal xylem was present. A fairly thick band of phelloderm\r\nand periderm, apparently subepidermal in origin, forms the peripheral\r\ntissue, and in places epidermal cells with attached ramenta are\r\nclearly preserved. The ramenta are of the type characteristic of the\r\nmajority of fossil Cycadean stems. Stomata were found showing a pair of\r\nguard-cells and apparently two subsidiary cells: the epidermal cells\r\nhave straight walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 535.

(After Lignier.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea micromyela_ Morière.\r\n\r\nThis Liassic species from Normandy has been fully investigated by\r\nLignier[1175]; originally referred to the Conifers, it was afterwards\r\ndescribed by Morière[1176] as _Cycadeoidea micromyela_. As regards\r\nexternal features the stem is of the usual _Cycadeoidea_ type:\r\nSaporta[1177] assigned it to the genus _Platylepis_. The secondary\r\nxylem consists of tracheids with bordered pits on the radial walls\r\narranged as single contiguous rows, resembling scalariform pitting, or\r\nas 1–2 rows of separate circular pits (fig. 538, A), a type different\r\nfrom that of the great majority of Mesozoic species. The uniseriate\r\nmedullary rays are 7–20 cells deep, a character recalling the compact\r\nwood of Indian _Williamsonia_ stems. Ramental scales are for the most\r\npart replaced by long unicellular hairs like those of _Williamsonia\r\nscotica_ and some Indian stems. Lignier states that true ramenta\r\noccur on the young leaves and in older fronds become transformed by\r\nseparation of the cells into long tubes. Each leaf-trace arises as a\r\nsingle bundle dividing into three as it leaves the stele and eventually\r\nsplits up into several collateral bundles (fig. 538, B, C). The stele\r\nis elliptical. No fertile shoots are preserved: a single axillary\r\nbud is described which agrees very closely with that in _Cycadeoidea\r\ngigantea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 539. _Cycadeoidea Jenneyana_ (?).

Reichenbachiana_ in\r\ntheir thick columnar form but differ from the former in the presence\r\nof bisporangiate flowers associated with the leaf-bases. This species\r\nprobably reached a length of 3–4 met. A striking feature[1179] is the\r\nunusual thickness of the xylem-cylinder, which shows clear indications\r\nof concentric rings, probably the expression of seasonal changes during\r\nthe production of secondary conducting tissue by a single cambium.\r\nSimilar concentric rings have been described in the stems of the\r\nrecent Cycad _Dioon spinulosum_[1180]. Fig. 539 represents an ovulate\r\nstrobilus referred to this species by Wieland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadeoidea pumila_ Fliche and Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis French Portlandian species[1181] affords a good example of a very\r\nsmall bulbiform trunk, 3·5–4 by 2·5–3 cm., superficially resembling\r\na Pine-cone: the leaf-bases are, however, less uniform in size and\r\nshape than Abietineous cone-scales; there are also indications of\r\ninterpetiolar ramenta and a small lateral, presumably fertile, branch.\r\nA stem of similar form is described by Saporta[1182] from Corallian\r\nbeds in France as _Bulbopodium micromerum_, and _Cycadeoidea nana_\r\nWard[1183] from Dakota is another example of a small Zamia-like\r\nMesozoic stem. A small tuberous stem, 8 × 7·5 cm., was described by\r\nLindley and Button from Lyme Regis as _Cycadeoidea pygmaea_[1184]; no\r\nflowers are shown in the drawing, but occasional irregularities in the\r\narrangement of the leaf-bases may be due to the presence of lateral\r\nfertile shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cycadella.= Ward.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Lester Ward[1185] for some\r\npetrified stems from Jurassic beds in Wyoming of relatively small size,\r\nbulbous or more or less spherical, and characterised by the presence\r\nof a thick layer (5–15 mm.) of dense ramental tissue. The unusually\r\nvigorous development of the ramental scales is an interesting feature,\r\nthough it is perhaps questionable whether it is worthy of generic\r\nrecognition. The flowers of _Cycadella_, though less than those of most\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ stems, are of the same type. In a later account of the\r\ngenus Ward[1186] describes a few additional species and in _Cycadella\r\nramentosa_ he notes the preservation of young fronds. The fronds are\r\nsmall and bear a few pinnae: the xylem is said by Wieland[1187] to\r\nbe mesarch, but in the absence of more details the foliar bundles\r\ncannot be fully described. In some Cycadellas young flowers, less than\r\n1 cm. in diameter, are preserved, those of _Cycadella wyomingensis_\r\n(7 mm. in diameter) being the smallest bisporangiate strobili so far\r\nrecorded. The French species, _Cycadeoidea micromyela_ Mor., resembles\r\n_Cycadella_ in the profuse development of ramental tissue which may\r\ncover the surface of the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Amphibennettites.= Fliche.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted[1188] for two species founded on very\r\nimperfectly preserved ‘fruits’ of Lower Cretaceous (Albian) age from\r\nthe Argonne which, though in close agreement with _Bennettites_ as\r\nrepresented by _B. Gibsonianus_ and _B. Morierei_, are referred to a\r\nseparate genus on the ground that the preservation is not such as to\r\nestablish their generic identity with those species and because of\r\ncertain distinctive features.\r\n\r\n_Amphibennettites Bleicheri_ Fliche. The ovulate strobili are\r\nsub-elliptical, 3·5 × 3 cm., with several elliptical pits close to\r\nthe surface originally occupied by seeds borne on short stalks and\r\nlarger than the seeds of other species of _Cycadeoidea (Bennettites)_.\r\nInterseminal scales occur between the seeds. The second species,\r\n_Amphibennettites Renaulti_, is rather larger and more conical: the\r\nseeds reach a length of 11 mm. greater than that of any of the American\r\nseeds described by Wieland. In neither species is there any indication\r\nof an involucre of bracts. The preservation of the specimens leaves\r\nmuch to be desired, but it would seem that the Argonne fossils agree\r\nin their main characters with Bennettitean strobili and it is doubtful\r\nwhether a distinctive generic name is necessary. The occurrence of\r\nseeds over the whole surface, a feature that suggested the name\r\n_Amphibennettites_, may be only apparent and the result of cutting\r\nthe cone transversely. It is worthy of note that one of Fliche’s\r\nsections[1189] bears a close resemblance to an Araucarian cone, and in\r\nthe absence of structure the two types of cone might easily be confused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 540. _Vectia luccombensis._ Transverse section\r\nshowing the alternation of fibres, _s_¹, _s_², and radial pairs\r\nof pitted elements, _v_¹ and _v_²; _m_, medullary-ray cells; _a_,\r\nparenchyma cell between four thin-walled elements; _sp_, pits between\r\nadjacent fibres; _l_, much reduced lumen of fibre. (After Stopes.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vectia.= Stopes. Genus _incertae sedis_.\r\n\r\n_Vectia luccombensis_ Stopes.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Vectia_ has been given by Dr Stopes[1190] to some\r\npetrified secondary phloem discovered by her at Luccomb Chine in the\r\nIsle of Wight: the fossil is from Aptian beds. The mass of phloem\r\nis 26 mm. in breadth and consists of regularly alternating bands\r\nof thin-walled sieve-tubes and very thick fibres associated with a\r\nlittle parenchyma (fig. 540). To the naked eye the specimen presents\r\nan appearance suggestive of rings of growth but this is due to the\r\npresence of bands of 2–3 narrow cells which are probably cork. The\r\nwhole is penetrated by uniseriate medullary rays. A striking feature\r\nis the regular alternation of single rows of fibres with two bands\r\nof sieve-tubes; in places the two bands of sieve-tubes are separated\r\nby 2–4 rows of very flat, presumably, cork-cells, and similar bands\r\nmay be adjacent to or pass obliquely across the fibres. The elongated\r\nelements described as sieve-tubes, though thin in comparison with the\r\nfibres, have thickened walls and on their radial faces are single\r\nrows of circular pits, often in pairs; these are almost certainly\r\nsieve-areas which have lost the finer pitting of the sieve-plates.\r\nThe fibres are more or less square in transverse section and have\r\nexcessively thick walls, the lumen being reduced to a small hole.\r\nParenchymatous cells (fig. 540, _a_) occupy the angles between the\r\nsieve-tubes and occasionally stretch tangentially between a pair of\r\ntubes: these are compared by Dr Stopes to companion-cells, but their\r\nmanner of occurrence hardly justifies the interesting suggestion that\r\nthey may be precursors of the Angiosperm companion-cells. The medullary\r\nrays may be as wide as the elements which they traverse; they are\r\ncharacterised by their wavy walls, as seen in radial longitudinal\r\nsections; no pitting was noticed. A remarkable feature of the specimen\r\nis its considerable breadth: it is pointed out that in a giant stem\r\nof _Sequoia_ with a girth of over 40 ft the secondary phloem does not\r\nexceed 3–4 mm. in breadth. The great thickness of the phloem in the\r\nfossil suggests comparison with the corresponding tissue in recent and\r\nfossil Cycadean stems, and the alternation of hard and soft phloem is\r\na feature exhibited also by _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ (fig. 518, B). Dr\r\nStopes concludes that the phloem is in the main similar to that in some\r\nCupressineae, Taxineae, and Taxodineae. It is noteworthy that similar\r\nphloem with sieve-tubes and fibres associated with cork is described by\r\nGraf Solms-Laubach[1191] from Upper Jurassic beds in Franz Josef Land.\r\nThe systematic position of _Vectia_ cannot be definitely determined,\r\nbut I believe that it is more closely allied to Cycadean than to\r\nConiferous phloem.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+Note.+ It is unfortunate that Mr Wieland’s second volume dealing\r\nwith American Cycads [Wieland (16)] did not come into my hands until\r\nnearly the whole of this volume was in type. Students will find in it\r\nmany additions to our knowledge of _Cycadeoidea_ and _Williamsonia_,\r\nmuch theoretical discussion that is suggestive and interesting, useful\r\nsummaries of our knowledge of fossil Cycads, and many beautiful\r\nphotographic plates illustrating the morphology of American species of\r\n_Cycadeoidea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n                     BENNETTITALES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n=WILLIAMSONIA.= Carruthers.\r\n\r\nThis genus was first figured by Young and Bird[1192] from specimens\r\nobtained from Lower Estuarine beds near Whitby: these authors compared\r\nthe fossils to the head of an Artichoke (_Cynara integrifolia_), ‘the\r\ncovering or calyx consisting of numerous lanceolate and striated\r\nleaves’ (fig. 544). In 1840 Williamson[1193] noticed the association\r\nwith fronds of _Zamia gigas_ Lind. and Hutt. of ‘a remarkable fossil,\r\napparently connected with the fructification of a _Cycas_,’ and some\r\nyears later Yates[1194] expressed the opinion that the fructifications\r\nfigured by Young and Bird probably belonged to the plants which\r\nbore the fronds known as _Zamites gigas_. Leckenby[1195] figured\r\nsome leaves of _Palaeozamia pecten_ (= _Ptilophyllum pecten_) in\r\nclose association with a small flower of _Williamsonia_ which was\r\nsubsequently recognised as a whorl of microsporophylls. In 1870 two\r\npapers of exceptional interest were published, one by Williamson[1196]\r\nwho was the first to attempt an exhaustive account of the genus, and\r\nthe other by Carruthers[1197] who proposed the name _Williamsonia_,\r\nthus associating ‘with a group of the most characteristic Yorkshire\r\nfossils two men (father and son) who have largely contributed to the\r\nexposition of Yorkshire geology.’ Carruthers instituted a new tribe\r\nWilliamsonieae for the genus _Williamsonia_, the type-species being\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_: the specific name had been previously given by\r\nLindley and Hutton to the fronds (_Zamia gigas_) of the plant which\r\nwas believed to have borne the flowers for which the new designation\r\nwas proposed. Two other species, _Williamsonia hastula_ and _W.\r\npecten_, were assigned to the new genus. The conclusion arrived at by\r\nWilliamson as to a connexion between _Zamites gigas_ and _Williamsonia_\r\nflowers was, however, not accepted by Saporta[1198], who figured and\r\ndescribed several exceptionally good specimens from the Yorkshire coast\r\nwhich formed part of the Yates collection in the Paris Natural History\r\nMuseum. In 1897 a short account was published[1199] of the Yates\r\nspecimens, an examination of which convinced me of the correctness of\r\nWilliamson’s views as to an organic connexion between stems, peduncles,\r\nflowers, and fronds. During a visit to Paris several photographs were\r\ntaken, but these were not published: similar photographs have since\r\nbeen reproduced by Wieland[1200] and reduced copies from two negatives\r\nin my possession are shown in figs. 541, 542. The restoration by\r\nWilliamson in his well-known memoir is probably correct so far as the\r\ngeneral habit of the plant is concerned, though the flowers which\r\nhe speaks of as male are now known to be ovulate. The position of\r\nthe male organs, whether borne separately or on the same axis as the\r\nmegasporophylls, has not been definitely settled.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Marquis of Saporta thus introduced his discussion on\r\nWilliamsonia,—‘avec les _Williamsonia_ nous abordons un des problèmes\r\nles plus difficiles, un des sujets des plus controversés, mais\r\naussi les plus curieux, peut-être même le plus remarquable de tous\r\nceux que nous offre l’ensemble des plantes jurassiques.’ Wieland’s\r\ninvestigations have placed us in possession of many important\r\nfacts with regard to the closely allied flowers of _Cycadeoidea_\r\nand have enabled us considerably to extend our knowledge beyond\r\nthe stage represented by the work of Carruthers, Williamson, and\r\nother authors; and more recently Nathorst’s important discoveries\r\nhave demonstrated the close agreement between _Williamsonia_ and\r\n_Bennettites (Cycadeoidea)_. Several problems still remain unsolved.\r\nHaving regard to the deficiency of the data concerning the morphology\r\nof the _Williamsonia_ type of flower and the wider question as to\r\na phylogenetic relationship that some botanists believe to exist\r\nbetween the Bennettitales and the Angiosperms, Saporta’s words\r\nare still pertinent. Wieland’s discoveries in Mexico[1201] have\r\nfurnished additional evidence of the wide geographical distribution\r\nof the _Williamsonia_ type of flower in the Jurassic period, and it\r\nmay be confidently asserted that the Bennettitales, including both\r\n_Williamsonia_ and _Cycadeoidea_, occupied a dominant position in the\r\nfloras of the world during the stage of plant-development immediately\r\npreceding the evolution and rapid spread of the Angiosperms, the\r\npresent dominant class.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable uncertainty among authors with regard to\r\nthe application of the name _Williamsonia_. In former accounts of the\r\ngenus the name was employed by me both for leaves and flowers on the\r\nground that Williamson was correct in his opinion as to the connexion\r\nbetween _Williamsonia gigas_ and _Zamites gigas_. The type of frond to\r\nwhich the latter term is applied is by no means uncommon in Jurassic\r\nstrata though it is not always associated with flowers, and the\r\nuse of the generic term _Williamsonia_ is therefore not invariably\r\njustifiable. Nathorst[1202] has recently reiterated his opinion that it\r\nis inadvisable to employ the name _Williamsonia_ except for the flowers\r\nor the complete plant and strongly urges palaeobotanists to retain\r\nthe provisional genus _Zamites_ when the fronds only are in question.\r\nWhile agreeing with the contention that the greatest care should be\r\nexercised to avoid the use of generic names implying a correlation of\r\nvegetative and reproductive organs that rests on any evidence short of\r\ndemonstration, it may be suggested that the better plan is to add the\r\nname _Williamsonia_ in parentheses after _Zamites_ or _Ptilophyllum_\r\nin cases where there is no reason to doubt that the fronds belong to a\r\n_Williamsonia_ plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_ (Williamson).\r\n\r\nThe species selected for a rather detailed description is still\r\nimperfectly known, but it is particularly interesting as the type on\r\nwhich the first scientific account of the genus was based. The name\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_ is now generally employed for the flowers which\r\nbore megasporophylls as the essential organs: they may have been\r\nbisporangiate,—a view that seems to me the more probable,—but this\r\nhas not been demonstrated. There are very few cases in which fronds of\r\n_Zamites gigas_ occur in organic connexion with stems, and we cannot\r\nwith safety employ other than a provisional generic term for fossil\r\nstems which it is believed bore flowers of the _Williamsonia_ type.\r\nFor the imperfectly preserved piece of stem shown in fig. 541 the\r\nname _Williamsonia (Bucklandia) gigas_ is employed, as there is no\r\nreasonable doubt that in addition to the fronds of _Zamites gigas_ it\r\nbore peduncles (fig. 541, _a_), with _Williamsonia_ flowers. This and\r\nother stems found in close association with _Williamsonia_ flowers in\r\nEngland, India, and Mexico are of the type known as _Bucklandia_[1203];\r\nbut it would in most instances be unwise to add _Williamsonia_ even as\r\na subordinate title. Casts of stems in close association with fronds\r\nand flowers are not uncommon in\r\n\r\ncollections of plants from the Yorkshire coast; the surface-features\r\nare of the type shown in fig. 576, rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped bases\r\nof petioles as described under the genus _Bucklandia_[1204]. The stem\r\nreproduced in fig. 541, about 5 cm. broad, is imperfectly preserved and\r\nthe leaf-bases are not clearly seen. Saporta’s figure[1205] conveys\r\nbut a poor idea of the actual specimen. To one side of the stem, 5 cm.\r\nfrom the lower, broken, end, are attached the petioles of two clearly\r\npreserved fronds of _Zamites gigas_, and above these is part of a third\r\nfrond apparently in its original position. The main axis is prolonged\r\nobliquely upwards to the left as a branch, _a_, 3 cm. broad and 14 cm.\r\nlong, covered with hairy bracts and bearing distally several narrow,\r\nlinear-lanceolate, scale-leaves. This branch is undoubtedly a fertile\r\nshoot or peduncle. A specimen figured (from a drawing) by Saporta[1206]\r\nas a peduncle of a _Williamsonia_ flower and reproduced in fig. 542 is,\r\nin surface-features, identical with the branch _a_ shown in fig. 541,\r\nbut at the apex it bears a bud covered with linear bracts identical\r\nwith those of _Williamsonia gigas_. This bud is almost certainly a\r\nyoung flower. Similar peduncles are described by Williamson, and he\r\nspeaks of one which is bifurcated: this specimen is probably that\r\nreproduced in fig. 543 and now in the Leeds Museum: at the base the\r\naxis is 3·5 cm. in diameter; the two divergent arms bear numerous\r\nbracts identical with those of _Williamsonia gigas_ and in addition\r\nare a few shorter ovate scales recalling those figured by Nathorst as\r\nprobably belonging to _Williamsonia pecten_. The Leeds specimen is\r\nfrom the Lower sandstone and shale near Scarborough. Similar branched\r\npeduncles are represented in the Whitby Museum and in the National\r\nCollection. Wieland[1207] has also figured a peduncle bearing a\r\n‘typical fruit bud’ of _Williamsonia gigas_ similar to that reproduced\r\nin fig. 542. These specimens fully justify Williamson’s restoration\r\npublished in his paper of 1870.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 541. _Williamsonia gigas._ Fronds (_Zamites\r\ngigas_) and flowering shoot, _a_, attached to a stem (_Bucklandia_).\r\n(Yates Collection, Paris; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 542. _Williamsonia gigas._ Flowering shoot and\r\nflower-bud. (Yates Collection, Paris.)]\r\n\r\nIn a former account of this species[1208] the opinion was expressed\r\nthat the flowers described by Williamson as male were ovulate and\r\nconstructed on the plan of those of _Bennettites Gibsonianus_\r\nCarr. This conclusion has since been confirmed by Nathorst[1209]\r\nwho succeeded in obtaining excellent preparations of the cuticular\r\nmembranes of interseminal scales and micropylar tubes (fig. 545),\r\ndemonstrating their very close agreement with those of the flowers of\r\n_Cycadeoidea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 543. _Williamsonia gigas._ Two peduncles, B and\r\nC, with imperfectly preserved bracts.

My own view is that both are\r\nof the same nature and consist of microsporophylls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 544. _Williamsonia gigas._ Portion of a flower\r\nshowing the protective bracts, the annular zone formed by numerous\r\nsterile sporophylls and interseminal scales, and the large central\r\ncavity originally occupied by the receptacle.

The base\r\nof the fossil is characterised by an annular zone formed of crowded,\r\nradially disposed, narrow ridges now known to be casts of interseminal\r\nscales. At the outer edge of this annular area impressions of the\r\npeltate ends of interseminal scales are not infrequently preserved.\r\nFig. 545 is a photograph of one of Nathorst’s preparations showing\r\nthe very great similarity between a micropylar tube of _W. gigas_ and\r\nthe corresponding structures in _Cycadeoidea_. The small micropylar\r\ntubes are surrounded by 5–6 polygonal expanded apices of interseminal\r\nscales as in _Cycadeoidea_ (fig. 515; _cf._ also fig. 563), and the\r\napex of each peltate distal end projects slightly as a central papilla\r\ncomposed of more strongly cuticularised cells. In most specimens the\r\nmegasporophylls and interseminal scales (sterile megasporophylls) are\r\npreserved only as an annular zone at the base of the receptacle (fig.\r\n548, _as_), but it is clear from some specimens of _W. gigas_ and other\r\nspecies figured by Saporta[1211], Nathorst[1212], and Krasser[1213]\r\nthat originally the whole surface of the pyriform axis was beset with\r\nthese organs which fell off, presumably, when the seeds had reached\r\nmaturity. No satisfactory examples of seeds have been found in English\r\nspecimens. Krasser has described some specimens of _Williamsonia_\r\nfrom Jurassic rocks in Sardinia to which he assigns some associated\r\nseeds, but, as he admits, there is no proof of any connexion. In some\r\ncases a funnel-like depression is seen at the upper end of a strobilus\r\nof _W. gigas_ (fig. 546, B, C, _a_) identical in the occurrence of\r\nradially disposed ridges with the annular zone at the base and due to\r\nthe preservation of interseminal scales and aborted megasporophylls in\r\nthe upper part of the receptacle: in this region also the impressions\r\nof polygonal apices of the scales are sometimes found. The probability\r\nis that while the greater part of the armour of scales and seeds was\r\nthrown off, at the upper and lower end of the receptacle some sterile\r\nmegasporophylls and scales remained (fig. 548, _as_, _dl_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 546. _Williamsonia gigas._ A, apical portion\r\nof flower. B, cast of A; _a_, persistent interseminal scales. C,\r\nflower in longitudinal section. C′, interseminal scales from the base.\r\n(Williamson Collection, Botany School, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nWilliamson regarded the funnel-shaped depression as the impression of\r\nthe lower surface of a laterally expanded portion of the axis of the\r\nflower, and to this expansion he gave the name lenticular disc (figs.\r\n546, 547, _a_). It is, however, much more likely that the apparent\r\nextension of the axis is due to the preservation of the sterile\r\nzone of armour which formed a cluster of appendages, the impressions\r\nof which are seen on the sides of the funnel-like depression, the\r\nreceptacle being prolonged as a slender axis (fig. 547, C). The next\r\npoint to consider is the form of the axis beyond the level of the\r\ncollar of sterile armour. Williamson described the axis as spreading\r\nout to form the lenticular disc and then prolonged as a narrow conical\r\npyramidal axis which is slightly extended horizontally immediately\r\nbelow a terminal mammilla: the apical mammilla he designated the\r\ncorona (fig. 547, C, _r_). As already stated, the lenticular disc\r\nis probably not an expanded part of the axis but the result of the\r\npreservation of a spreading mop-like cluster of interseminal scales.\r\nThis is the view expressed by Lignier[1214] who kindly furnished\r\nthe block from which fig. 548 is reproduced. The lower face of\r\nWilliamson’s lenticular disc is characterised by a series of spoke-like\r\nradiating ridges (fig. 547, A′) between which are less distinct\r\nradially disposed lines, and at the periphery there are impressions\r\n(fig. 547, A′′), continuous with some of the radiating ridges, of the\r\nterminal shields of interseminal scales. In fig. 547, drawn from one\r\nof the original specimens described by Williamson, these features are\r\nshown at A′ and B: fig. A′ represents the circular area, which is\r\nat right-angles to the axis of the flower, in surface-view. In the\r\ncentre of this circular area is a depression ending in a short papilla\r\nsurrounded by a narrow basal rim: this feature is shown on a cast of\r\nthe specimen represented in fig. 547, B. In this case Williamson’s\r\ncorona is seated on a very short axis whereas in fig. 547, C, also from\r\none of Williamson’s specimens, the corona forms the apex of a longer\r\npyramidal axis. Wieland[1215] regarded the circular area seen in fig.\r\n547, A, as the impression of the apical portion of a bisporangiate\r\nstrobilus, the ridges marking the edges of the incurved distal portions\r\nof microsporophylls bent over the apex of the ovulate cone (_cf._ fig.\r\n513), and he interpreted the polygonal depressions at the periphery\r\n(fig. 547, A′′) as those of sori, an interpretation entirely different\r\nfrom that of Lignier. The latter author[1216] in part reasserted his\r\nopinion but modified it as regards the meaning of the ridges on the\r\ncircular area, agreeing so far with Wieland as to consider them as\r\nhaving been formed by the folded-over rachises of microsporophylls\r\nattached as a concrescent collar to the base of the ovulate cone. This\r\ninterpretation does not, however, explain the relation between the\r\nradial striations on the circular area and the polygonal impressions\r\nat its periphery. Wieland still dissents from Lignier’s opinion and\r\nsuggests that the circular area has not been demonstrated to belong\r\nto the apical end of a flower. Fig. 547 shows that its position is\r\napical. Fig. 548 represents Lignier’s view as to the nature of the rim\r\nsurrounding the apical mammilla: he suggested that several interseminal\r\nscales borne at the apical region of the receptacle were concrescent\r\nand formed linear bracts the edges of which are represented by the main\r\nridges in fig. 547, A′. These concrescent scales bent upwards and were\r\nclosely applied to or perhaps concrescent with the pyramidal axis and\r\nwere then prolonged as a wide infundibuliform apparatus (Williamson’s\r\ncarpellary disc). This organ was, however, easily detached, and the rim\r\nseen at _r_ in fig. 547, C, represents its narrow broken base. With\r\nthis view I am in general agreement; but while Lignier regards the\r\nfunnel-like appendage as sterile and considers that similar organs,\r\nbut with a large central cavity at the base of the funnel, may have\r\nbeen microsporophyll-discs which were borne below the ovulate strobilus\r\nin the position occupied by the microsporophylls in _Cycadeoidea_\r\n(fig. 528)—my inclination is to see in the terminal appendage a\r\nwhorl of concrescent microsporophylls. This view lacks the support\r\nof demonstration. It is obvious from Williamson’s specimens and from\r\nothers described by Saporta, Nathorst, and Lignier that the receptacle\r\nof _Williamsonia gigas_ was not so simple in its termination as that\r\nof the flowers of _Cycadeoidea_. In _Cycadeoidea dacotensis_ Wieland\r\nshowed that the apex of the receptacle bore a tuft of long interseminal\r\nscales, and it is readily conceivable that these apical appendages\r\nwere still further developed in some _Williamsonia_ flowers to form a\r\nwhorl of concrescent leaves borne on the prolonged apex of the axis.\r\nThere is little doubt as to the homology of interseminal scales and\r\nmicrosporophylls, and there is no difficulty in supposing that while in\r\nsome flowers the foliar organs assumed the form of interseminal scales\r\nof unusual length, in other species they became microsporophylls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 547. _Williamsonia gigas._ A, flower in\r\nlongitudinal section, showing, especially on the left side,\r\ninterseminal scales and megasporophylls and a pyriform cavity\r\nrepresenting the central axis (nat. size).

(Diagrammatic drawing,\r\nafter Thomas; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIn the course of an examination of the _Williamsonia_ specimens (from\r\nYorkshire) in Paris in July of last year (1914) Mr Thomas[1219]\r\nfound a specimen previously overlooked, which is undoubtedly either\r\na male flower or, as I am inclined to think, the staminate disc of a\r\nbisporangiate flower of _Williamsonia gigas_. The nature of the matrix\r\nshows that it came from the neighbourhood of Whitby. It consists\r\nof an urn-shaped organ formed of the concrescent bases of 18–20\r\nmicrosporophylls each 7–8 mm. wide; the cup is 5–6 cm. broad, the\r\nbase being torn but tapered (fig. 549) as though originally prolonged\r\ndownwards into a stalk as in _W. spectabilis_. Along the middle line\r\nof each sporophyll is a series of depressions, probably the same in\r\nnature as those on _W. whitbiensis_ described by Nathorst, though it\r\nis not clear whether, in this case at least, they represent aborted\r\nsynangia. Some reniform synangia (fig. 549, B) occur in the rock just\r\nabove the cup. The sporophylls spread outwards from the base and then\r\ncurve inwards, bending outwards again as they become free. A portion\r\nof a microsporophyll is shown in fig. 550 bearing segments projecting\r\ninwards as in _W. spectabilis_ (fig. 551). This specimen, which occurs\r\nin association with female flowers, is regarded by Mr Thomas as part\r\nof a unisexual flower. He discusses the possibility of its connexion\r\nwith an ovulate receptacle and expresses the opinion that if it were\r\nborne at the upper end of a bisporangiate flower the whole would be\r\ntop-heavy and the arrangement uneconomical. On the other hand if, as\r\nsuggested on page 434, the flowers were bisexual the staminate disc,\r\nwhich reached maturity before the ovules, may have been thrown off,\r\nas in _Cycadeoidea_, before the seeds were ripe. The form of the disc\r\nresembles that of the Indian specimen described on another page as\r\n_Williamsonia_ sp., _cf._ _W. setosa_ Nath.; it does not, I venture to\r\nthink, afford an argument against the view that the microsporophyll-cup\r\nof some _Williamsonia_ flowers was attached near the apex of the\r\nreceptacle and was formed of modified foliar organs homologous with\r\nthose which, in the ovulate portion of the flower, constitute the\r\ninterseminal scales and megasporophylls.\r\n\r\nA further consideration of the microsporophylls of _Williamsonia_ will\r\nbe found in a later section of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia spectabilis_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis species[1220], the first example of undoubted microspore-bearing\r\norgans referred to _Williamsonia_, was founded on material discovered\r\nby Prof. Nathorst in the Lower Estuarine series of Whitby; it has also\r\nbeen obtained from beds of the same age at Marske in the Cleveland\r\ndistrict of Yorkshire[1221]. _Williamsonia spectabilis_, though\r\nindubitably a male organ, has not been found attached to a stem, and\r\nthere is no decisive evidence as to its connexion with a particular\r\nspecies of frond. Nathorst believes that it belongs to the plant which\r\nbore the leaves known as _Ptilophyllum pecten_, an opinion based\r\nchiefly on association. The more complete specimens consist of a broad\r\nfunnel-shaped organ prolonged below into a slender stalk and divided at\r\nthe margin into several linear-lanceolate segments (microsporophylls)\r\nthe apices of which were rolled inwards like young fern-fronds (figs.\r\n551, 552). The synangia agree closely in form and in such structural\r\nfeatures as can be made out from cuticular preparations with those\r\ndescribed by Wieland in American species of _Cycadeoidea_; they are\r\nslightly reniform, 5–6 mm. long and 2 mm. broad and divided into\r\nseveral loculi by transverse partitions (fig. 552). The microspores,\r\n58–65_µ_ in length, are rather narrow, ovate and very similar to those\r\ndescribed by Solms-Laubach[1222] in _Cycadeoidea etrusca_. The synangia\r\nare attached in two rows to slender lateral segments which appear to\r\nbe given off from the upper face near the median line of the broad\r\nlinear sporophylls (fig. 565, A). Nathorst points out that the position\r\nof the fertile pinnae brings the sporophylls into close relation with\r\nthe vegetative fronds of _Ptilophyllum pecten_ and other Cycadean\r\nfronds in which the pinnae are attached to the upper face of the\r\nrachis. While the longer pinnae in the middle portion of a sporophyll\r\nbear several synangia, those near the base and apex are shorter and,\r\nin the proximal region nearer the broad cup formed by the coherent\r\nbases of the sporophylls, occur singly, thus approaching the condition\r\ncharacteristic of _W. whitbiensis_ (fig. 565, B) in which they are\r\nsessile on the simple microsporophylls. It is noteworthy that in some\r\nspecimens figured by Nathorst there is a tendency of the lower part\r\nof the cup to break away from the coherent bases of the sporophylls\r\n(fig. 551)[1223], and it is not unlikely that some of the impressions\r\ndescribed as infundibuliform appendages are incomplete examples of\r\n_Williamsonia spectabilis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 551. _Williamsonia spectabilis_ and leaves of\r\n_Ptilophyllum pecten_. (After Nathorst; ⅚ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 552. _Williamsonia spectabilis._ Restoration of\r\nan almost mature male flower. (After Thomas; approximately nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 553. _Williamsonia Leckenbyi._ Surface-view and\r\nin section.\r\n\r\n(Restoration after Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Leckenbyi_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on specimens from the Middle Estuarine\r\nbeds exposed on the Yorkshire coast at Cloughton Wyke[1224], is\r\ncharacterised by the almost spherical form of the strobilus, 4·5–5 cm.\r\nin diameter. The relatively small receptacle is covered by a thick\r\nmass of megasporophylls and interseminal scales except in the lower\r\npart which bears only sterile scales. Nathorst believes that the seeds\r\nwere very small, but no undoubted examples have been found. A specimen\r\nin the British Museum, figured in 1900[1225], shows the surface-view\r\nof an impression of the base of the flower; a small circular raised\r\nboss occupies the centre—the scar of the receptacle—and surrounding\r\nthis is a reticulum formed by the impression of the distal ends of the\r\ninterseminal scales. The uniform nature of the reticulum, the meshes\r\nof which are all of the same type, shows that in the basal region of\r\nthe flower the organs borne on the receptacle were all sterile as in\r\n_Cycadeoidea (Bennettites) Morierei_. Except in the smaller diameter\r\nof the receptacle this specimen is practically identical with that of\r\n_Williamsonia Carruthersi_ Sew. reproduced in fig. 559. The form of\r\nthe strobilus is shown in Nathorst’s restoration[1226] represented\r\nin fig. 553. The interseminal scales have broad peltate distal ends\r\ncharacterised by a patch of lighter and thinner-walled cells at the\r\napex (fig. 554); the micropylar tubes are slightly expanded at the\r\nsummit and their epidermal cells are papillose as in _Williamsonia\r\nscotica_ (_cf._ fig. 563, B). Nathorst in 1909 adopted the name\r\n_Williamsonia pecten_ Carr.[1227] for the specimens originally referred\r\nto _W. Leckenbyi_ as well as for microsporophylls that he believed\r\nto belong to the same plant as the ovulate strobili: but in a later\r\npaper[1228] he restricts the name _Williamsonia pecten_ to the male\r\nstrobili, reserving _W. Leckenbyi_ for the ovulate forms, as there is\r\nno proof that both were borne on the same plant. From the evidence\r\nat present available it is reasonable to regard _W. Leckenbyi_ as a\r\nunisexual flower. In all probability the fronds known as _Ptilophyllum\r\npecten_ are the foliage of the parent-plant of _W. Leckenbyi_, though\r\nin the absence of proof it is advisable to retain both names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 554. _Williamsonia Leckenbyi._ Micropyle and\r\ninterseminal scale.\r\n\r\n(After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia whitbiensis_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nUnder this name Nathorst[1229] described some interesting specimens of\r\nmicrosporophylls formerly attributed by him to _Williamsonia pecten_,\r\nbut the discovery of additional material led him to distinguish the\r\nWhitby (Lower Estuarine) fossils as _W. whitbiensis_, retaining the\r\nname _W. pecten_ for the type originally figured by Leckenby[1230]\r\nfrom the Middle Estuarine series at Cloughton Wyke on the Yorkshire\r\ncoast. In the type-specimen, 8–10 cm. in diameter, there are 15\r\nlinear segments coalescent basally into a thick cup differing from\r\nthat of _W. spectabilis_ in the absence of a stalk (figs. 555, 556).\r\nA more important distinctive feature is the production of synangia\r\non the simple sporophylls (figs. 556, B; 565, B) and not on special\r\nfertile segments as in _W. spectabilis_ (fig. 552). The inner face of\r\neach sporophyll, as seen in impressions, shows two regular rows of\r\nsmall depressions, one on each side of the median line; these become\r\ngradually smaller towards the base of the cup-like disc (figs. 555,\r\n556). On the actual carbonised surface of the inner face of the cup\r\nsmall and transversely elongated projections take the place of the\r\ndepressions and these show the same decrease in size when traced from\r\nthe free segments to the cupular organ. Nathorst obtained microspores\r\nonly from the larger projections and none from the smaller, a\r\ncircumstance which may indicate that only the upper and larger synangia\r\nwere fully developed[1231].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 555. _Williamsonia whitbiensis._ (After Nathorst;\r\n⅚ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 556. _Williamsonia whitbiensis._ A, male flower.\r\nB, sporophyll with synangia. (After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\nThis species is especially interesting as throwing light on the nature\r\nof one of the specimens (from the Whitby Museum) figured by Williamson\r\nas a ‘carpellary disc[1232]’: the ‘seeds’ of Williamson are no doubt,\r\nas Nathorst believes, synangia, while the smaller pairs of markings\r\nfigured by Williamson represent rudimentary synangia and not ‘abortive\r\novules.’ Though the specific identity of Williamson’s specimen and\r\n_Williamsonia whitbiensis_ is not certain, the latter is undoubtedly a\r\nclosely allied form of a microsporophyll-verticil. A specimen figured\r\nin 1900 as a flower of _Williamsonia pecten_[1233], designated by\r\nNathorst _Williamsonia_ sp., is a very similar if not an identical\r\ntype; it consists of a fairly deep basal cup the surface of which is\r\ncharacterised by the presence of several regular ridges between which\r\nare pairs of small depressions containing carbonaceous matter. In the\r\nlight of Nathorst’s researches it is clear that this is an incomplete\r\nexample of a whorl of microsporophylls. The base of the disc is\r\nincomplete, but it is certain from the small size of the basal hole\r\nwith torn edges that the cup could not have been attached to the base\r\nof a receptacle as are the microsporophylls in Wieland’s bisporangiate\r\nflowers of _Cycadeoidea_. The specimens referred by Nathorst to\r\n_Williamsonia pecten_[1234] (Leck. _ex parte_) are similar to those\r\ndescribed as _W. whitbiensis_, but differ in the texture of the cup and\r\nin the degree of cuticularisation of the synangial walls. The synangia\r\nof _W. pecten_ are of the usual reniform type and multicellular as in\r\n_W. spectabilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia setosa_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features of this species[1235], founded on material\r\ncollected by Dr Halle from Lower Estuarine beds at Whitby, are (i)\r\nthe greater number of linear sporophylls which bear numerous bristles\r\nor stout hairs, (ii) the loose coherence of the contracted proximal\r\nportion of the linear segments, and (iii) a narrower basal disc in\r\nplace of the deeper cup of other species. One of the specimens referred\r\nto this species, formerly regarded by Nathorst as an infundibuliform\r\norgan of an ovulate strobilus of _W. gigas_[1236], bears a striking\r\nresemblance to an Indian fossil described by Feistmantel from\r\nIndia[1237].\r\n\r\n\r\n+Indian species of Williamsonia (Flowers).+\r\n\r\nSeveral specimens of _Williamsonia_ have been described from the\r\nRajmahal and other Jurassic series in India, some of which exhibit a\r\nclose agreement with _Williamsonia gigas_. It is, however, noteworthy\r\nthat no fronds of the _Zamites gigas_ type have been discovered in\r\nIndian beds; on the other hand the association of fronds of the\r\nsame type as _Ptilophyllum pecten_ with Williamsonian strobili is\r\nsignificant, as also the occurrence of stems apparently identical in\r\nsurface-features with English and Mexican species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ sp.\r\n\r\nOldham and Morris[1238] figured a specimen from the Rajmahal Hills\r\nconsisting of a circular disc enclosed by a zone of ‘closely packed\r\ntubes,’ the basal portion of an ovulate Williamsonia strobilus,\r\nwhich they regarded as a pressed mass of young leaves ‘probably\r\nrelated to _Palaeozamia_’ [_Ptilophyllum_]. The figured specimen\r\nshows that the radially disposed ‘tubes’ surrounding the circular\r\narea are interseminal scales some of which are seen at the periphery\r\nin surface-view as small polygonal areas as in English specimens.\r\nFeistmantel[1239] refigured this specimen and referred it to\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_ though on insufficient grounds. To the same\r\nspecies Feistmantel[1240] assigns two other specimens from the\r\nRajmahal series, one of which consists of several narrow linear\r\nbracts partially enclosing a strobilus with a portion of the annular\r\nzone at the base in which the seminiferous scales are shown in\r\nlongitudinal-view and a few in apical-view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ sp. _cf._ _Williamsonia setosa_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 557. _Williamsonia_ sp. A, whorl of\r\nmicrosporophylls; _s_, synangia (?). C, side-view of the basal portion\r\nof A. B, part of a microsporophyll enlarged. (Indian Geological Survey;\r\nA, nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nA third example from the same locality (fig. 557) is described\r\nby Feistmantel[1241] as part of one of Williamson’s ‘carpellary\r\ndiscs[1242],’ a comparison that is fully justified. The accompanying\r\ndrawing has been carefully made from the actual specimen: portions of\r\n10 very hairy bracts radiate in a horizontal plane from a continuous\r\nlamina with a wrinkled and ridged surface bent sharply back at\r\nright-angles to the bracts and forming a double curve as seen in the\r\nsectional view (fig. 557, C). The form assumed by the vertical part\r\nof the disc is, I believe, the result of compression. Wieland[1243]\r\nregards this fossil as a whorl of microsporophylls originally attached\r\nto the lower portion of the receptacle of a bisexual flower. Close to\r\nthe edge of one of the bracts is an imperfectly preserved structure\r\n(fig. 557, B, _s_) which may represent two alternately arranged rows of\r\nsynangia belonging to one of the hairy bracts; but we have no evidence\r\nas to the position of the microsporophylls on the flower-axis. The\r\ncentral space enclosed by the crushed concrescent portion of the disc\r\nis large enough to have embraced a receptacle but, on the other hand,\r\nthe portion preserved may have broken off from a proximal cup like\r\nthat of _W. spectabilis_[1244], which, as Nathorst’s specimens show,\r\nis sometimes broken across near the upper edge of the basal funnel.\r\nThis specimen is spoken of by Feistmantel as _Williamsonia gigas_. It\r\nis impossible to say whether these Rajmahal specimens belong to one\r\nspecies, and they are therefore provisionally designated _Williamsonia_\r\nsp. and _Williamsonia_ sp. _cf._ _W. setosa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia microps_ Feistmantel.\r\n\r\nThis species is based on a compressed ovate strobilus surrounded by\r\nlinear bracts and a portion of the cylindrical axis[1245]. It is\r\npossible that this smaller, bud-like, specimen may be a younger example\r\nof the species referred by Feistmantel to _Williamsonia gigas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Blandfordi_ Feistmantel.\r\n\r\nFounded on a small strobilus enclosed by linear bracts, from the\r\nJurassic rocks of Cutch[1246], very similar to _Williamsonia pecten_;\r\nas seen in fig. 558, drawn from the original specimen, the flower is\r\nassociated with a _Ptilophyllum_ frond indistinguishable from some\r\nexamples of _Ptilophyllum pecten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia indica_, sp. nov.\r\n\r\nThis name is proposed for some imperfect specimens described by\r\nFeistmantel from the Godaveri district and named by him _Williamsonia_\r\nsp. _cf._ _Williamsonia gigas_[1247]. They differ from _Williamsonia\r\ngigas_ in the larger size of the bracts which reach a length of 13 cm.\r\nand may be compared with those of a large specimen recorded from Mexico\r\nas _Williamsonia Cuauhtemoc_[1248].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 558. _Williamsonia Blandfordi_ and _Ptilophyllum_\r\nfrond.\r\n\r\n(Geological Survey of India; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that some at least of the Indian flowers were\r\nborne on stems with the foliage known as _Ptilophyllum acutifolium_, an\r\ninference based not only on the almost constant association of flowers\r\nand fronds but also on the juxtaposition of both kinds of organs with\r\nstems precisely similar to those described from England and Mexico.\r\nThough none of the specimens are sufficiently well preserved to afford\r\nmuch information as to structural features, Miss Bancroft[1249] has\r\nshown that the bracts of one of the examples assigned by Feistmantel\r\nto _W. gigas_ are similar anatomically to those of _Williamsonia\r\nscotica_ and are clothed with simple hairs. The important point is\r\nthe very close correspondence between the Indian and English types of\r\n_Williamsonia_, as regards flowers, fronds, and stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n+British Specimens.+\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Carruthersi_ Seward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 559. _Williamsonia Carruthersi._ A, unexpanded\r\nflower. A′, the reticulate lamellae projecting from the face of a\r\nbract. B, the basal portion of a larger and expanded flower showing the\r\nimpressions of the interseminal scales and the base of the receptacle.\r\n(British Museum, A, V. 3177; B, V. 3201.)]\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on several specimens from Wealden beds on\r\nthe Sussex coast none of which afford information as to anatomical\r\nstructure[1250]. It is not improbable that more than one species is\r\nrepresented. The ovulate cone, 6 cm. long, is surrounded by several\r\nlinear bracts (fig. 559, A) and in shape resembles _Bennettites\r\nMorierei_ Lign.; the bracts are broken across near the base, as is\r\nfrequently the case in _Williamsonia gigas_, exposing an annular zone\r\nformed by persistent interseminal scales. From the inner face of some\r\nof the bracts project slender radiating plates (fig. 559, A′) which\r\nno doubt mark the boundary of the superficial and relatively large\r\ninterseminal scales, like those forming the so-called pericarp in\r\n_Bennettites Gibsonianus_. The receptacle appears to have been conical,\r\na feature recalling _Bennettites_ rather than _Williamsonia_. The\r\nsaucer-like impression shown in fig. 559, B, is practically identical\r\nwith the corresponding portion of _Williamsonia Leckenbyi_: the centre\r\nis occupied by a raised area, the basal part of the receptacle, on\r\nwhich a series of peripheral prominences represents the vascular\r\nstrands; the sides of the saucer show very clearly the reticulum formed\r\nby the distal ends of interseminal scales. One reason for assigning\r\nthis species to _Williamsonia_ rather than to _Bennettites_ (or\r\n_Cycadeoidea_) is the occurrence in the same bed of a peduncle 12 cm.\r\nlong and 3 cm. broad which probably belonged to the parent-plant of\r\nthe cone. The surface of the peduncle shows spirally disposed scars of\r\nbracts crowded at the distal end and more widely separated in the lower\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Bucklandi_ (Unger).\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Buckland[1251] gave an account of a ‘unique and beautiful\r\nfossil fruit’ from Inferior Oolite beds at Charmouth in Dorsetshire\r\nand stated that the type-specimen was in the Oxford Museum. Professor\r\nSollas kindly searched for the specimen some years ago but without\r\nsuccess. Buckland considered that the fruit was related to the\r\nPandanaceae and described it as follows: ‘The size of this fruit is\r\nthat of a large orange, its surface is occupied by a stellated covering\r\nor epicarpium, composed of hexagonal tubercles, forming the summits\r\nof cells, which occupy the entire circumference of the fruit. Within\r\neach cell is contained a single seed, resembling a small grain of rice\r\nmore or less compressed, and usually hexagonal. When the epicarpium\r\nis removed, the points of the seeds are seen, thickly studded over\r\nthe surface of the fruit. The bases of the cells are separated from\r\nthe receptacle by a congeries of foot-stalks formed of a dense mass\r\nof fibres, resembling the fibres beneath the base of the seeds of the\r\nmodern _Pandanus_.’ At the suggestion of Robert Brown he called the\r\n‘fruit’ _Podocarya_, the specific name _Bucklandi_ being afterwards\r\ngiven by Unger[1252]. Brongniart[1253] called attention to the\r\nresemblance of Buckland’s specimen to _Williamsonia_, and that name\r\nhas been adopted by Saporta[1254], Nathorst, and other authors[1255].\r\nSowerby’s drawings illustrating the original description, one of which\r\nis reproduced in fig. 560, show that this unusually fine specimen is\r\nan ovulate Bennettitean strobilus very similar in its thick conical\r\nreceptacle to some of Wieland’s species of _Cycadeoidea_, _e.g._ _C.\r\ndacotensis_ (fig. 528): the armour of scales and megasporophylls agrees\r\nexactly with that of some species of _Williamsonia_ from Yorkshire\r\nand with the flowers of _Cycadeoidea_. Though included in the genus\r\n_Williamsonia_ it would not be out of place in _Cycadeoidea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 560. _Williamsonia Bucklandi._ (After Buckland; ⅚\r\nnat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia scotica_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen was found by Hugh Miller near Cromarty (N.E.\r\nScotland) and figured as a cone of peculiar form[1256]; it was obtained\r\nfrom a limestone nodule probably derived from Upper Jurassic rocks.\r\nThe fossil is 11 cm. long and has a maximum breadth of 6 cm. (fig.\r\n561): numerous linear bracts cover the surface and in the lower portion\r\nmany of them are broken. A noteworthy feature is the absence of any\r\nclean-cut base, a fact pointing to fracture rather than a natural\r\nabscission of the fertile axis. The following description may serve\r\nto give a general idea of the salient characters. Flowering shoot\r\novoid, covered with linear bracts some of which are prolonged above\r\nthe conical apex as slender tapered organs and two of them bear a few\r\nshort lateral appendages (fig. 561, _l_), probably reduced leaflets,\r\nnear their distal ends. The cylindrical axis, completely hidden by\r\nbracts, 1·5 cm. in its widest part, bears in the lower or sterile\r\nregion bracts and long hairs and in the upper part interseminal scales\r\nand immature megasporophylls which together form a narrow band (fig.\r\n562, _S_) 2 mm. broad extending over the incompletely preserved and\r\nconical apex, as in some of the American examples of _Cycadeoidea_.\r\nThe strobilus was probably borne at the apex of a lateral branch given\r\noff from a stem covered with persistent petiole-bases: there is no\r\nevidence that this was the case, but the appearance of the ovoid cone\r\nsuggests comparison with those of _Williamsonia gigas_ which were\r\nterminal on fairly long branches and not partially hidden among the\r\nbases of fronds as in _Cycadeoidea_. It is, however, possible that the\r\ncone of _Williamsonia scotica_ is a lateral structure: this suggestion\r\nis based on the occurrence of a small branch or bud, which may be the\r\napex of the whole fertile shoot, given off from the cone-axis but only\r\nrevealed in transverse sections. The interseminal scales, 2 mm. long\r\nand 0·23 mm. broad at the truncate distal end (fig. 563), are polygonal\r\nin section and arranged as rosettes of 5–6 around each megasporophyll\r\n(fig. 564, a section tangential to the peripheral layer of scales and\r\nsporophylls). The megasporophylls, equal in length to the scales,\r\nconsist of a cylindrical axis bearing a terminal megasporangium, an\r\nundifferentiated nucellus, enclosed in a single integument prolonged\r\nas a micropylar tube above the conical end of the nucellus (fig. 563,\r\nB, C, _a_). Fig. 562 represents a transverse section through the cone\r\nshowing the cylindrical axis with its compact covering layer (fig. 563,\r\nA, _s_) of sterile and fertile appendages, and beyond this sections\r\nof the enveloping bracts embedded in a dense felt of long hairs. The\r\ntissue of the axis, though very imperfectly preserved, shows occasional\r\ngroups of secretory sacs and a few patches of scalariform tracheids:\r\nthere is evidence of the occurrence of peripheral conducting tissue\r\nin the lower portion of the axis such as occurs in the peduncles of\r\nAmerican species of _Cycadeoidea_ described by Wieland. The bracts\r\nnearer the axis are more shrivelled than those farther away, the\r\nresult of the feebler development of hypodermal stereome in the more\r\ninternal bracts. Sunken stomata occur on the lower surface of some of\r\nthe bracts: several collateral bundles are present in each and large\r\nsecretory ducts are abundant. The numerous hairs on the bracts and the\r\nsterile region of the cone are outgrowths of epidermal cells; most of\r\nthem consist of a short basal cell and a very long thick-walled tubular\r\nhair reaching a length of several centimetres. In some cases the basal\r\ncell bears a group of short cells each of which is the starting-point\r\nof a long hair: this is worthy of notice from the point of view of\r\ncomparison with the ramenta of other Bennettitalean flowers. The short\r\nproximal cell of a hair is surrounded by a cuticular ring like a\r\nrounded base-moulding where it rests on the epidermis: this has been\r\naptly compared to the dark rings that form a striking feature of the\r\ncuticular membrane of _Ptilophyllum_ leaflets[1257].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 561. _Williamsonia scotica._ Strobilus in\r\nsurface-view; _l_, bract with short lateral appendages.

(_ca._ × 100.)]\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the type-specimen the first section cut was\r\ntransverse to the axis (fig. 562), and this happened to traverse the\r\nlowest part of the fertile region of the receptacle, as was shown by\r\nthe fact that in the next lower section the axis bore only bracts\r\nand hairs. It is clear that the sterile portion of the receptacle\r\npassed abruptly upwards into the fertile region, and it is extremely\r\nunlikely that any microsporophylls were borne at the base of that\r\nportion of the cone-axis which produced the scales and megasporophylls.\r\nThe cone was, in all probability, unisexual. On the analogy of the\r\ncones shown in figs. 513, 514, one would expect to find between the\r\nsterile and fertile regions either a verticil of microsporophylls or\r\nthe remains of an annular disc from which the effete sporophylls had\r\nbeen detached. There is no trace of any such disc, and the fact of\r\nthe immaturity of the megasporophylls renders it unlikely that were\r\nthe cone bisexual the microsporophylls would have been detached. As\r\nprevious records show, there is nothing improbable in the occurrence\r\nof a unisexual Bennettitean flower. These remarks are made in view\r\nof an opinion expressed by Dr Wieland that the bracts with lateral\r\nappendages (fig. 561, _l_), to which allusion has been made, are\r\nmicrosporophylls and that if the cone had been sliced longitudinally\r\nthe presence of a microsporophyll-disc would have been discovered.\r\nThe latter possibility has already been considered, and as regards\r\nthe former there is nothing in the structure of the small lateral\r\nappendages of the longest bracts to indicate that they were connected\r\nwith spore-production. It is not unlikely that the bracts with small\r\noutgrowths (fig. 561, _l_) correspond to the more leaf-like bracts of\r\n_Wielandiella_ and _Williamsoniella_. The two sets of organs spoken of\r\nas interseminal scales and megasporophylls are probably homologous,\r\nfoliar, structures; in the one case leaves transformed into cylindrical\r\norgans bearing terminal integumented and undifferentiated megasporangia\r\nand, in the other, sterile or sterilised sporophylls. The polygonal\r\ntruncate distal end of an interseminal scale is flat or slightly\r\nconcave and covered by a thick epidermis, and on the sides of the\r\nscale many of the surface-cells are strongly papillose (figs. 563,\r\n564). The rest of the interseminal scale consists mainly of elongated\r\ncells, which in the lower portion of the axis of the scale assume a\r\ntubular form, presumably immature conducting elements: in one scale\r\nonly was any tracheal tissue found and that was represented by 2–3\r\nscalariform tracheids. The scales appear to arise from the axis like\r\nthe bracts as superficial outgrowths, and probably in a later stage of\r\ndevelopment the centre of each scale would be occupied by a vascular\r\nstrand. The megasporophylls bear a close resemblance to the scales,\r\nbut in transverse section they appear as smaller and circular organs\r\neach the centre of a group of polygonal interseminal scales precisely\r\nas in other Bennettitean flowers (fig. 564; _cf._ fig. 515). The\r\nproximal part of a megasporophyll consists of a column of parenchyma\r\n(fig. 563, A, _s_) extending through half of the length; from this\r\ncolumn is detached a narrow cylinder of small crushed cells which\r\nmost likely represents the remains of tissue that originally occupied\r\nthe space surrounding the axial column. At a higher level the axial\r\ncolumn becomes broader and its short cells more elongated and slightly\r\ndivergent towards the sloping sides of the conical nucellus. The loose\r\ncylinder of tissue is attached to the nucellar cone and prolonged\r\nbeyond its apex as a broad integument enclosing a very small micropyle\r\n(fig. 563, C). The apex of the integument has the form of a shallow\r\nfunnel: its epidermal cells are papillose (fig. 563, B, C) and the\r\npresence of short transversely elongated cells is a characteristic\r\nfeature of the tissue lining the micropylar canal. The bracts agree\r\ngenerally with those of _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_, _Cycadeoidea\r\nMorierei_, and the American species. The ground tissue is composed of\r\nsclerenchyma comparable with the scalariform elements in the bracts\r\nof _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ (_cf._ fig. 520). It is in the possession\r\nof long hairs like those on the leaves of _Dioon_ and other recent\r\nCycads that _Williamsonia scotica_ differs from previously described\r\nflowers in all of which the fern-like ramental scales are a conspicuous\r\nfeature. It is interesting to find that similar hairs are substituted\r\nfor scales in some Indian stems described by Miss Bancroft[1258].\r\nLignier[1259] mentions the occurrence of long unicellular hairs on\r\n_Cycadeoidea micromyela_ (p. 415), a Jurassic French species, but\r\nthe ramenta are in part multicellular lamellae and the presence of\r\ntransitional forms suggests a possible derivation of hairs from scales\r\nboth in fossil species and in recent Cycads. The megasporophylls and\r\ninterseminal scales are much shorter than in _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_\r\nand other species in which the axis of the cone forms a depressed\r\nreceptacle (_cf._ fig. 521, A, C), but they correspond closely with\r\nthose of several American species. In _Cycadeoidea Gibsoniana_ and _C.\r\nMorierei_ the distal ends of the interseminal scales are much broader\r\nand their diameter greatly exceeds that of the micropylar tubes, 2·8\r\nmm. as compared with 0·25 mm., whereas in _Williamsonia scotica_\r\nthe scales are 0·23 mm. broad and the micropylar tubes 0·15 mm. The\r\nmummified micropylar tubes of _W. pecten_ bear a striking resemblance\r\nin form and in the papillose epidermal cells to those of the Scotch\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThere are two additional points suggested by the structure of the\r\nfertile region, namely the possibility that the megasporophylls are\r\narrested rather than immature organs and, secondly, the method of\r\npollination. In regard to the first there would seem to be no adequate\r\nreason for doubting the correctness of the view that the sporophylls\r\nare potentially perfect ovules which were petrified at a comparatively\r\nearly stage in development. The dense woolly covering investing the\r\nsurface of the scales and megasporophylls recalls an inflorescence\r\nof _Aesculus hippocastanum_ in its winter-fur and hardly suggests a\r\ncollection of ovules accessible to microspores. In all probability at a\r\nlater stage the protecting bracts with their felt of hairs would bend\r\noutwards leaving exposed the receptive micropyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Microsporophylls.+\r\n\r\nIn view of the association of microsporophylls and ovulate strobili\r\nin the flowers of _Cycadeoidea_ described by Wieland, most of which\r\nare bisexual, it is reasonable to expect a similar association in the\r\nflowers of _Williamsonia_ which agree closely in the essential features\r\nof both micro- and mega-sporophylls with those of _Cycadeoidea_. It is,\r\ntherefore, surprising that in no single case have the microsporophylls\r\nattributed to _Williamsonia_ been found in actual connexion with a\r\nreceptacle bearing interseminal scales and megasporophylls. The same\r\nstatement holds good with regard to the Williamsonias discovered\r\nin Mexico. Nathorst believes that the microsporophylls on which he\r\nhas founded several species are unisexual flowers with the possible\r\nexception of _W. pyramidalis_[1260]. This species, found by Dr Halle\r\nat Cloughton Wyke, is represented by a small ovulate strobilus\r\ncharacterised by a conical receptacle with a blunt mucronate apex: with\r\nit is associated a microsporophyll bearing synangia. The orientation\r\nof the two specimens is such as to suggest an original connexion.\r\nAs Nathorst says, there is, however, no proof that the two belong\r\nto one flower. Wieland[1261], though believing that the existence\r\nof bisporangiate Williamsonia flowers is ‘reasonably certain,’\r\nagrees with Nathorst’s conclusion as to the unisexual character of\r\n_W. spectabilis_ and _W. pecten_. On the other hand, he regards the\r\nmicrosporophyll-verticil which was first described by Williamson as\r\na carpellary disc, then named by Nathorst[1262] _W. bituberculata_\r\nand afterwards identified as a microsporophyll-disc closely allied\r\nto _W. whitbiensis_, as the staminate part of _W. gigas_. This view\r\nis, in my opinion, impossible to reconcile with the nature of the\r\nspecimen. If, as Wieland suggests, it is the staminal collar split\r\noff from the base of a large ovulate cone like that of _Williamsonia\r\ngigas_, one would expect to find a central space in the middle of the\r\ncupular base large enough to embrace the receptacle. Neither in this\r\nspecimen nor in several other forms of microsporophyll-verticils is\r\nthere such a central space. It is clear that the discs described as\r\n_W. spectabilis_, _W. whitbiensis_, and other species were not borne\r\nas concrescent collars on a stout axis as are the corresponding organs\r\nin _Cycadeoidea_. The Indian specimen reproduced in fig. 557 and the\r\nvery closely allied type _W. setosa_ are incomplete at the centre and\r\nmay possibly have been borne at the base of an ovulate bisporangiate\r\nstrobilus, but there is no definite evidence that this was the case.\r\nMoreover, in _W. spectabilis_ the lower part of the cup (fig. 551)\r\neasily splits away from the rest of the staminate disc, and this may\r\nexplain the central space in the specimen shown in fig. 549, A. If _W.\r\nspectabilis_, to take one example, is a complete flower there are\r\ncertain difficulties which are not easily explained: as Nathorst has\r\nshown, in this type there is a short stalk, but in _W. whitbiensis_\r\nthe base of the funnel has no stalk and there is no interruption of\r\nthe stout lamina at the centre or any indication of a scar. Nathorst\r\ncompares the funnel-like region of _W. whitbiensis_ to a kind of\r\ncupule which became detached after flowering[1263]. But a cupule is\r\nsupported on an axis and, though no scar is apparent on some of the\r\nmore complete specimens, it is obvious that the verticil must have been\r\nsupplied with vascular tissue from some axial organ. This brings us to\r\nthe consideration of a morphological point which cannot be definitely\r\nanswered. Nathorst has previously raised the question—is it possible\r\nthat the microsporophylls were attached to the upper part of an ovulate\r\nstrobilus; were the flowers bisexual and epigynous? He believes the\r\nanswer to be in the negative. Reference has already been made to the\r\nprobable occurrence at the apex of the receptacle of _Williamsonia\r\ngigas_ of a funnel-like organ of the type described by Williamson as\r\n‘carpellary disc[1264],’ a term under which Nathorst[1265] believes\r\nthat Williamson included two different things,—staminate discs\r\nborne on separate, unisexual, flowers, and sterile organs called\r\nby Lignier[1266] the infundibuliform apparatus. The latter, it is\r\nbelieved, were attached to the apex of an ovulate strobilus as shown\r\nin fig. 548, comparable in position with the leaves at the summit of\r\nan inflorescence of _Ananas_. A comparison of the fossils regarded as\r\ninfundibuliform appendages with some of the microsporophyll-verticils\r\nshows that they are identical in form, the only difference being\r\nthat on the former there are no synangia. This fact can hardly be\r\nregarded as negative evidence fatal to the morphological identity of\r\nthese sterile and fertile organs. The available evidence, though far\r\nfrom complete, is favourable to the view that in some _Williamsonia_\r\nflowers, _e.g._ _W. gigas_, the microsporophylls were produced at the\r\napex of the axis in the position shown in fig. 548. To cite a rough\r\nanalogy,—in _Cycadeoidea_ the flower was hypogynous as in _Erica_; in\r\n_Williamsonia_ epigynous as in _Vaccinium_. This view does not exclude\r\nthe possibility of the existence of unisexual flowers in some species,\r\nbut the evidence in favour of a separation of the sexes is by no means\r\ndecisive. Another difficulty is the absence of protective bracts in the\r\ncase of the microsporophylls, a striking contrast to the bract-enclosed\r\novulate strobili of _Williamsonia_ or to the bract-covered flowers\r\nof _Cycadeoidea_. Were the microsporophylls borne on a separate axis\r\ngeneral considerations would lead us to expect the association of\r\nbracts with the essential organs. The fact that no such association has\r\nbeen recorded is a fact favourable to the view that the flowers were\r\nbisporangiate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 565.

(A, B, after Nathorst; C, after Wieland.)]\r\n\r\nThe student is warned that the opinion expressed with regard to the\r\nposition of the microsporophylls is contrary to that which is held by\r\nseveral palaeobotanists[1267].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia mexicana_ Wieland.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of the numerous types discovered by Wieland in\r\nMexico[1268]. It is distinguished by the deep campanulate concrescent\r\nportion of the whorl of microsporophylls and by the ten short free\r\nlobes which bear two rows of lateral synangia (fig. 565, C). Among\r\nthe British forms _Williamsonia whitbiensis_ would appear to be the\r\nmost closely allied type. _W. mexicana_ occurs in association with\r\n_Otozamites_ fronds, as is the case with an Italian specimen figured by\r\nZigno[1269], but in the Mexican species there is no conclusive evidence\r\nof organic connexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Other species of Williamsonia.+\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Haydeni_ Seward.\r\n\r\nA Jurassic species from Afghanistan[1270] founded on a single specimen\r\nof a flattened broadly-oval flower similar to _W. gigas_ but smaller\r\nand enclosed by narrow linear bracts. An interesting feature is the\r\noccurrence of a funnel-shaped depression at the apex showing radiating\r\nlines on its surface as in the _Williamsonia_ represented in fig. 546,\r\nA. In all probability these lines denote the persistence of a collar\r\nof interseminal scales on the upper part of the elongated conical\r\nreceptacle. An examination of the carbonaceous material revealed\r\nthe presence of some short rods agreeing in size and shape with the\r\ninterseminal scales of other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Otozamitis_ (Zigno).\r\n\r\nZigno[1271] instituted the generic name _Blastolepis_ for some\r\nspecimens from the Jurassic rocks of north Italy which he referred to\r\nthree species, _B. falcata_, _B. acuminata_, and _B. Otozamitis_. These\r\nare true Williamsonias closely allied to _W. gigas_. An examination of\r\nthe type-specimen of _B. Otozamitis_ in the Padua collection led me\r\nto the conclusion that Zigno was correct in representing the ovulate\r\nstrobilus, which shows an annular area like that in specimens of _W.\r\ngigas_, as being in organic connexion with an _Otozamites_ frond.\r\nWieland has recently discovered species of _Williamsonia_ in Mexico\r\nthat he correlates with _Otozamites_ leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ sp.

The form suggests a _Williamsonia_,\r\nbut the evidence is hardly decisive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Forchammeri_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nA Bornholm species[1274] from Lower Jurassic strata represented by\r\nan annular zone surrounding a central area, probably a portion of an\r\novulate strobilus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia minima_ Saporta.\r\n\r\nThis Upper Jurassic species from Portugal[1275] consists of a number of\r\nsmall bracts or leaves attached to a central axis and is of no value as\r\nevidence of the occurrence of _Williamsonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia problematica_ (Newberry).\r\n\r\nThis species was first described from the Amboy clays as _Palaeanthus_\r\n(_Williamsonia_) _problematica_[1276] and compared to a Composite\r\ninflorescence with long ray-florets. More recently Hollick[1277] has\r\nreferred to this species specimens from the Cretaceous of Long Island\r\nand Martha’s Vineyard, but none of them afford conclusive evidence of\r\nWilliamsonian affinity. Some of the examples, as suggested by Hollick,\r\nagree fairly closely with _Williamsonia cretacea_ Heer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Smockii_ Newberry.\r\n\r\nThe curious urn-like bodies from the Amboy clays[1278] on which this\r\nspecies is based are not unlike the capsules of a _Papaver_ but bear no\r\nreal resemblance to a _Williamsonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia Riesii_ Hollick.\r\n\r\nA species from the Cretaceous rocks of Martha’s Vineyard[1279] referred\r\nto _Williamsonia_ on rather slender grounds and represented by\r\nimperfect material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ (?) _phoenicopsoides_ Ward.\r\n\r\nThis fossil from the Cretaceous of the Black Hills, Dakota[1280], is\r\nmuch too imperfect to be accepted as a record of _Williamsonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia elongata_ Lesquereux.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on part of a conical receptacle with some\r\nappendages superficially resembling those of _Williamsonia_[1281], is\r\ntoo incomplete to be determined with any confidence. The type-specimen\r\nis from Cenomanian beds in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia virginiensis_ Fontaine.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly a true member of the genus; it is characterised by\r\nnarrow ovate bracts bearing conspicuous hairs surrounding the base of\r\na receptacle which shows a portion of an annular zone of interseminal\r\nscales[1282].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ (?) _gallinacea_ Ward.\r\n\r\nThis species from the Potomac beds[1283] is of no value as a record of\r\n_Williamsonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia_ (?) _Bibbinsi_ Ward.\r\n\r\nThe imperfectly preserved specimen from the Potomac series so named\r\nby Ward[1284] is probably part of an Abietineous cone as stated by\r\nBerry[1285] who includes Ward’s type with other specimens referred to\r\n_Abietites macrocarpus_ Font.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia cretacea_ Heer.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens, figured by Heer[1286] from the Lower Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland, on which this species is founded, consist of an axis covered\r\nwith small scale-leaves and at the broad apex bearing numerous narrow\r\nlinear bracts forming a more or less spherical cluster 3·8 cm. in\r\nbreadth. The species resembles _W. problematica_ (Newb.).\r\n\r\n_Williamsonia recentior_ Dawson.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from the Middle Cretaceous of Canada figured by\r\nDawson[1287] under this name are very imperfect and of no botanical\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 566. _Wielandiella angustifolia._ (After\r\nNathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=WIELANDIELLA.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThe specimens on which this genus is founded were originally described\r\nby Nathorst from Höör in Scania as _Williamsonia angustifolia_[1288]:\r\nin a second paper[1289] a restoration of the plant was published (fig.\r\n566). The examination of additional specimens from the Rhaetic of\r\nBjuf and of cuticular preparations led to the establishment of a new\r\ngenus _Wielandia_[1290] for which _Wielandiella_[1291] was afterwards\r\nsubstituted, _Wielandia_ having been previously employed for an\r\nexisting plant. _Wielandiella_ agrees in the general morphology of\r\nits bisporangiate flowers with _Cycadeoidea_, but differs widely from\r\nnearly all other members of the Bennettitales in the repeatedly forked\r\nslender stem which is in marked contrast to the vegetative axis of any\r\nrecent Cycad. Among recent Cycads with terminal strobili an indication\r\nof a primitive dichasium is afforded by the occurrence of an aborted\r\nbud in a stem of _Dioon edule_ described by South and Compton[1292];\r\nbut in the habit of the stem _Wielandiella_ is far removed from any\r\nrecent Cycadean type. The microsporophylls are smaller and simpler than\r\nin _Williamsonia_ or _Cycadeoidea_ and the foliage-leaves are of the\r\n_Anomozamites_ type (_cf._ fig. 615).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 567. _Wielandiella angustifolia._ Branched stem\r\nand receptacle. (After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wielandiella angustifolia_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nIn an account of this species in 1902 Nathorst described two types of\r\nstrobilus, male and female, but a re-investigation of the material led\r\nto a modification of the earlier conclusions. The stem is slender,\r\nrarely exceeding 1·5 cm. in breadth, repeatedly branched as a dichasial\r\nsystem with a fertile shoot in the forks formed by the equal and\r\nwidely divergent branches. Nathorst’s restoration, as he points out,\r\nmay exaggerate the regularity of the branching, but an examination of\r\nthe original specimens in the Stockholm Museum convinced me that the\r\nhabit represented in fig. 566 is substantially correct. The method of\r\nbranching is similar to that in the inflorescences of Gnetalean plants\r\nand recalls some _Gleichenia_ fronds. The surface of the thicker pieces\r\nof stem shows fine longitudinal striae, while transverse striations\r\nlike those on the axis of a _Heterangium_ frond characterise the\r\nmore slender specimens. Closely set polygonal leaf-scars cover the\r\nstem for a short distance below each bifurcation and the surface of\r\nthe short and relatively stout peduncles of the strobili (fig. 567).\r\nThough for the most part confined to the region of false dichotomy,\r\nleaf-scars occasionally occur on other parts of the stem. Small\r\nfronds, 7–8 cm. long, agreeing closely with _Anomozamites minor_\r\nBrongn., occur in the same beds at Bjuf, and the striking resemblance\r\nbetween their long linear and winged petioles and the transversely\r\nstriated bracts enclosing the strobili of _Wielandiella_ amply\r\njustifies Nathorst’s conclusion that _Wielandiella_ bore fronds of the\r\n_Anomozamites_ form[1293]. Small scars marking the position of bracts\r\noccur immediately below each strobilus and occasionally form narrow\r\nzones between the larger foliage leaf-scars. The strobili are met with\r\nin two forms representing two states of preservation and, probably,\r\ndifferent ages. In one form the strobilus consists of a small pyriform\r\naxis separated from the peduncle by an annular swelling characterised\r\nby parallel striations (fig. 567), the so-called palisade-ring. From\r\nthis ring Nathorst obtained many microspores scattered and in groups\r\non the surface of short sporophylls, 2·5–3 mm. in length. It is these\r\nsporophylls which form the parallel striations; they occur as a circle\r\nof rather broad linear organs with irregularly toothed distal ends and\r\nan epidermis of papillose cells. The oval microspores, 32–42μ long,\r\nvary in size and, as Nathorst says, this may indicate immaturity. The\r\nprecise mode of occurrence of the spores has not been ascertained, but\r\nthey were probably produced in sporangia on the surface of the small\r\nmicrosporophylls. These strobili have in all probability lost the\r\nfemale organs which were borne on the pyriform axis, and the inference\r\nis that the strobili were protogynous. Thomas[1294] compares the ring\r\nat the base of the flower-axis from which spores were obtained by\r\nNathorst to the whorl of microsporophylls of _Williamsoniella_, but\r\nin _Wielandiella_ the sporophylls are greatly reduced and possibly\r\nfunctionless. _Wielandiella_ may be intermediate between the bisexual\r\n_Williamsoniella_ and the unisexual _Williamsonia scotica_. In the\r\nsecond form of strobilus the pyriform axis is hidden and the specimens\r\nconsist of a central ovate body, approximately 3 cm. long, surrounded\r\nby several linear bracts (fig. 568, A). The carbonised surface of the\r\ncentral region revealed on chemical treatment a fairly regular pattern\r\nformed by the contiguous polygonal ends of interseminal scales arranged\r\nround smaller cylindrical micropylar tubes which project beyond the\r\nlevel of the scales (fig. 568, B). This arrangement agrees closely with\r\nthat of the corresponding organs in _Williamsonia_ and _Cycadeoidea_\r\n(_cf._ figs. 515, 564). In _Wielandiella_ the micropylar tubes are of\r\nuniform diameter and the cells of the epidermis have smooth walls in\r\ncontrast to the micropylar tubes of _Williamsonia_ (fig. 563). The\r\nstrobilus in this state, before the scales and ovules have become\r\ndetached from the axis, may be described as a small _Williamsonia_, but\r\nthe habit of the stem is in itself a sufficient reason for the use of a\r\ndistinctive generic name[1295].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 568. _Wielandiella angustifolia._ A, conical\r\nreceptacle with bracts. B, surface-view of scales and micropylar tubes.\r\n(After Nathorst; A, ¾ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nA second species, _Wielandiella punctata_, described by Nathorst[1296]\r\nfrom Scania is founded on pieces of forked stems associated\r\nwith fragments of a palisade-ring formed of contiguous segments\r\n(microsporophylls) with microspores 58μ in length. Fronds of\r\n_Anomozamites minor_ occur in the same beds.\r\n\r\nMr Hamshaw Thomas[1297] described some specimens from the Middle\r\nJurassic beds of Marske in Yorkshire which he suggested might be pieces\r\nof a _Wielandiella_ stem. Additional material was subsequently found\r\nand this enabled Thomas to produce evidence in favour of connecting the\r\nbranched vegetative axis with bisporangiate strobili and the fronds of\r\n_Taeniopteris vittata_. For the stems and flowers the new designation\r\n_Williamsoniella_ has been proposed. Further research will no doubt\r\nshow that the _Wielandiella_ type of stem was not exceptional in\r\nRhaetic and Jurassic floras.\r\n\r\nNathorst[1298] suggests the possibility that some specimens from the\r\nSolenhofen Slates described by Thiselton-Dyer[1299] as _Condylites\r\nsquamatus_ may be allied to _Wielandiella_. The generic name\r\n_Condylites_ was suggested by the elbow-like branching of stems which\r\nbore imperfectly preserved and apparently terminal cones; the surface\r\nof the branches is covered with the scars of leaves. The resemblance to\r\n_Wielandiella_ is, however, slight and it would seem more probable that\r\nthe Solenhofen fossils are Coniferous, though, as Nathorst says, the\r\nsupposed scale-like ‘leaves’ may be scars of Cycadean fronds.\r\n\r\nWieland[1300] records the occurrence in Mexico of stems similar to\r\nthose of _Wielandiella_ associated with some _Otozamites_ fronds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WILLIAMSONIELLA.= Thomas.\r\n\r\nThis genus was instituted for specimens discovered by Mr Hamshaw\r\nThomas[1301] in the Middle Estuarine series of the Middle Jurassic\r\nplant-bed at Gristhorpe on the Yorkshire coast, and the genus is\r\nrecorded also from the Cleveland district in the same county.\r\n_Williamsoniella_ occurs in those parts of the Gristhorpe bed where\r\nfronds of _Taeniopteris vittata_ are abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsoniella coronata_ Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe type-species is represented by fertile shoots consisting of a\r\ncentral axis bearing both megasporophylls and microsporophylls (figs.\r\n569, 571, A). Below its crown-like sterile apex the pyriform peduncle\r\nis covered with small interseminal scales and ovules similar to those\r\nof _Williamsonia_: this portion is 6 mm. in diameter and 1 cm. long.\r\nA whorl of separate cuneate microsporophylls forms a hypogynous ring\r\nbelow the basal interseminal scales: each sporophyll is attached by\r\na narrow base (fig. 570) and bears 5–6 reniform synangia containing\r\nmicrospores. The flower is thus bisexual: it affords no conclusive\r\nevidence of the occurrence of any covering bracts like those of most\r\nBennettitalean flowers. In young specimens the microsporophylls are\r\nclosely packed round the axis (fig. 571, B). The flower-stalks reach\r\na length of 3·5 cm. and are 3 mm. in diameter. Fig. 571, C, shows a\r\nreceptacle from which the sporophylls have fallen: the microsporophylls\r\nhaving been no doubt attached to the collar-like swelling at the base.\r\nTowards the apex the axis becomes broader and at _s_ a few interseminal\r\nscales are left: above these is the apical disc (corona) characterised\r\nby longitudinal ribs. An apical disc is reproduced in fig. 572; it\r\nhas the form of a royal crown 1–2 mm. high with 12–16 vertical ridges\r\nseparating flat surfaces formed by the pressure of microsporophyll\r\napices in the unexpanded flower. The corona is surmounted by a small\r\nconical elevation which represents the apex of the fertile axis. An\r\napical view of an unexpanded flower is shown in fig. 571, B; the\r\ntips of 12 sporophylls are closely pressed against the corona which\r\nprobably consists in part at least of fused interseminal scales. The\r\nmicrosporophylls were shed after the dehiscence of the synangia. Each\r\nsporophyll is flattened on the sides and thicker on the curved outer\r\nedge; the synangia, usually in two rows of three, are borne on the\r\nsloping sides (figs. 569, 570). The surface of a microsporophyll is\r\ncovered with small rounded projections which produce a characteristic\r\nappearance. The form of a microsporophyll in section is shown in fig.\r\n570: the synangia are similar in shape to those of _Cycadeoidea_ and\r\n_Williamsonia_ (_cf._ figs. 531, 549, etc.) but there are no external\r\nindications of septa like those seen in some other types. On macerating\r\nsome specimens it was found that the spores occur in about 20 groups.\r\nThe circular or elliptical spores are 0·02 mm. in diameter. The walls\r\nof the epidermal cells of the microsporophylls are straight: the\r\nstomata, which show the features characteristic of the Bennettitales,\r\nagree closely with those of _Taenopteris vittata_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 569. _Williamsoniella coronata._ Vertical section\r\nof the flower showing the pyriform axis with small megasporophylls and\r\ninterseminal scales and the microsporophylls with synangia.

(After Thomas; ×\r\n3.)]\r\n\r\nThe interseminal scales associated with the ovules and covering the\r\npyriform axis above the microsporophylls are more or less flattened\r\nand hexagonal and the micropylar tubes often project far beyond\r\nthe scales. Each micropyle-tube is surrounded by 5–6 interseminal\r\nscales (_cf._ fig. 564). The ovules differ from those of _Cycadeoidea\r\nGibsoniana_ in the absence of a distinct pedicel and agree with the\r\ncorresponding organs of _Williamsonia scotica_[1302]. In the absence of\r\nepidermal papillae the micropylar tubes resemble those of _Wielandiella\r\nangustifolia_. As already stated, the flowers appear to be without\r\nprotective bracts, but in the shale from which the specimens were\r\nobtained a few bract-like organs were discovered consisting of a\r\nlanceolate lamina 1·5 cm. long, and 2–3 mm. broad near the base,\r\nand some showed a small oval lamina at the apex with a midrib and\r\ndichotomously branched lateral veins. These bracts with the terminal\r\nlamina are regarded by Thomas as almost certainly reduced leaves of the\r\n_Taeniopteris vittata_ type: they are represented in the restoration\r\n(fig. 573) as occurring at the base of the flower-peduncle. Stomata\r\nwere found on the bracts exactly like those on the microsporophylls,\r\nand this affords a strong argument in support of the view that\r\n_Williamsoniella_ belongs to the plant which bore _Taeniopteris_\r\nfronds. There is a close parallelism between the bracts accompanying\r\n_Williamsoniella_ flowers and those described by Nathorst in connexion\r\nwith _Wielandiella_[1303]. It seems reasonable to regard the bracts as\r\nserving the purpose of bud-scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 573. _Williamsoniella coronata._ Restoration\r\nof part of a plant: the upper leaves are represented only by the\r\npetiole-bases. (After Thomas; _ca._ ⅜ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAn important point is the constant association with the flowers of\r\n_Taeniopteris vittata_ fronds, a species described in Vol. +ii.+ and by\r\nmost palaeobotanists regarded as a Fern frond. _Taeniopteris_ leaves\r\noccasionally show a clean-cut base[1304] and in specimens described\r\nby Thomas there are two small humps on the surface of the proximal\r\nend of the petiole which represent vascular bundles. Humps of similar\r\nsize occur on the leaf-scars of stems which are believed to have borne\r\nboth _Taeniopteris_ leaves and _Williamsoniella_ flowers. Fragments\r\nof the stems were found in association with flowers: they are 7 mm.–2\r\ncm. in diameter and frequently forked and there is evidence that the\r\nflowers were borne at the forks, the shoot forming a dichasial system.\r\nThe habit of the plant is represented in fig. 573 reproduced from Mr\r\nThomas’s paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Williamsoniella Lignieri_ (Nathorst).\r\n\r\nThis species described by Nathorst as _Williamsonia_? _Lignieri_ from\r\nWhitby is regarded by Thomas as a _Williamsoniella_. The stomata on\r\nthe microsporophylls agree with those of _Taeniopteris_ and the spores\r\nobtained from Nathorst’s flower-buds are like those of _Williamsoniella\r\ncoronata_. Evidence is adduced by Thomas in favour of regarding _W.\r\nLignieri_ as bisexual and not unisexual as Nathorst supposed.\r\n\r\nIn habit _Williamsoniella_ resembles _Wielandiella_: in the latter\r\ngenus the foliage-leaves were confined to portions of the stem near\r\nthe forks, while in _Williamsoniella_ they were more uniformly\r\nscattered: _Wielandiella_ bore leaves of the _Anomozamites_ form while\r\n_Williamsoniella_ flowers are always associated with _Taeniopteris_\r\nfronds. The much greater spore-output of _Williamsonia_ may, it is\r\nsuggested by Thomas, be correlated with the unisexual nature of the\r\nflowers of that species. The microsporophylls of _Williamsoniella_\r\ndiffer in their more reduced form from the pinnate microsporophylls of\r\n_Williamsonia_, _e.g._ _W. spectabilis_, and agree more closely with\r\nthose of _Wielandiella_. The microsporophylls of _Williamsoniella_\r\nare free and not connate at the base as in _Cycadeoidea_ and\r\n_Williamsonia_. In its pyriform axis _Williamsoniella_ resembles\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_ and differs from _Williamsonia Leckenbyi_ in\r\nthe possession of a sterile apical corona: _Williamsoniella_ has\r\nmegasporophylls and microsporophylls both of which appear to be\r\nfunctional, while in _Cycadeoidea_ fully developed microsporophylls\r\noccur in association with megasporophylls which are immature and must\r\nhave matured much later than the microsporophylls. The new genus\r\nagrees with _Williamsonia_ in its general features, but the flowers\r\nare smaller and are characterised by the considerable reduction and\r\nsimplification of the male organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CYCADOCEPHALUS.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis genus was founded[1305] on a specimen from the Lower Rhaetic\r\nof Scania, at first regarded as a megastrobilus and on further\r\nexamination[1306] found to be a collection of microsporophylls\r\nresembling those of _Williamsonia_ and _Cycadeoidea_. The type-species\r\nis _Cycadocephalus Sewardi_, and a second species, _C. minor_, was\r\nsubsequently discovered by Dr Halle at a slightly higher horizon in\r\nthe Rhaetic series. Prof. Nathorst’s most recent account of the genus\r\naffords a striking illustration of the possibilities of the method,\r\nwhich he has employed with conspicuous success, of investigating\r\ncarbonised fossils by means of cuticular preparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 574. _Cycadocephalus Sewardi._ A, surface-view;\r\n_a_, appendages. B, the same specimen, after the removal of some\r\nof the microsporophylls, showing the appendages. C, section of a\r\nmicrosporophyll showing the attachment of appendages. D, section of an\r\nappendage. (After Nathorst. A, B, ¾ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadocephalus Sewardi_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen consists of an oval cluster of 16–18 linear\r\nmicrosporophylls, 9 cm. long, springing from a small circular disc\r\nformed of their concrescent and narrow bases. The whole flower (fig.\r\n574) exclusive of the peduncle is 10 cm. long and 7 cm. broad. The\r\nportion of the comparatively slender peduncle that is preserved shows\r\nno trace of leaf-scars. In the middle of each linear microsporophyll\r\nis a keel-like midrib and on either side of this is a series of linear\r\nappendages (fig. 574) 2–3 cm. long lying in a radial direction towards\r\nthe centre of the flower. These appendages were originally thought to\r\nbe seeds (fig. 574, _a_), but it was suggested by Wieland that they\r\nmight be synangia, the circle of leaves being the male portion of a\r\nbisexual flower of the _Cycadeoidea_ type. Nathorst’s more complete\r\ninvestigation of the specimen confirmed the first of these suggestions,\r\nbut there is no evidence that there was an ovulate receptacle in the\r\ncentre of the flower. The appendages are attached by a rather broad and\r\nslightly cordate base and are represented by a thin carbonised cuticle\r\nof rectangular cells showing in one case a row of imperfectly preserved\r\nstomata: on this are numerous groups of tetrahedral microspores, about\r\n55μ in diameter, which show a more or less well marked arrangement in\r\nrows transverse to the long axis of the thin laminae. It is clear from\r\nNathorst’s researches that the groups were enclosed in loculi bounded\r\nby thin-walled cells[1307], the loculi being in transverse rows on\r\neach side of a midrib. Nathorst speaks of the appendages as synangia\r\ncharacterised by the large number of the sporogenous compartments,\r\nand he compares them especially to the fertile leaflets of _Danaea\r\nelliptica_ as described by Bower[1308], each appendage being comparable\r\nwith a revolute _Danaea_ pinnule in which the edges of the lamina\r\nare united. This is illustrated by the section of an appendage (fig.\r\n574, D) reproduced from Nathorst’s restoration of a _Cycadocephalus_\r\nmicrosporophyll. From a morphological point of view it would seem more\r\nappropriate to speak of the appendages as highly modified pinnules\r\nrather than synangia. The second species, _C. minor_, agrees closely\r\nexcept in its smaller size with the type-species. Nathorst regards\r\n_Cycadocephalus_ as a unisexual flower differing from those of\r\n_Williamsonia_ and from the microsporophyll-verticils of _Cycadeoidea_\r\nin the structure of the synangia and in the tetrahedral form of the\r\nspores, though the latter feature he considers to be of secondary\r\nimportance, as both bilateral and radial spores occur in recent\r\nMarattiaceae. He includes the genus in the Bennettitales but suggests\r\nthat it should be referred to a separate family as an indication of\r\nthe possession of characters which mark it off from _Williamsonia_,\r\n_Weltrichia_, _Wielandiella_, and _Cycadeoidea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WELTRICHIA.= Braun.\r\n\r\nThe name _Weltrichia_ was given by Braun[1309] to some Rhaetic fossils\r\ndiscovered by Weltrich near Culmbach in Franconia which represent\r\nfunnel-shaped structures, the lower part having the form of an\r\nincomplete cup made of the concrescent bases of about 20 broadly\r\nlinear segments which in the upper part are separate lanceolate\r\nlobes each with a midrib and slightly curved inwards at the apex.\r\nThe whole, nearly 10 cm. long and 9 cm. in diameter at the upper\r\nedge, is very similar to the specimen of _Williamsonia spectabilis_\r\nreproduced in fig. 551. Braun described three species, but he realised\r\nthe possibility that the different forms may be different stages in\r\nthe development of a single type _Weltrichia mirabilis_. He assigned\r\nthe genus to the Rhinantheae. Saporta[1310] drew attention to the\r\nresemblance of Braun’s species to some examples of _Williamsonia_ from\r\nYorkshire which he considered to be portions of a sterile appendage\r\nborne at the apex of the flower. Some account is given of two types\r\nof funnel-like structures connected with _Williamsonia_ flowers on a\r\nprevious page[1311]: one of these has been shown by Nathorst to be\r\na whorl of microsporophylls, and it is with this that _Weltrichia_\r\nagrees. An important feature of _Weltrichia_ is the occurrence of short\r\nlinear segments, 5–8 mm. long, attached to the inner face of each of\r\nthe free portions of the linear lobes: the lobes, or more correctly\r\nthe free apical portions of the fertile leaves, and their slender\r\nappendages are compared by Nathorst[1312] to the microsporophylls and\r\nrelatively long synangia-bearing appendages of _Cycadocephalus_. These,\r\npresumably fertile, segments of _Weltrichia_ project in the flattened\r\nimpressions beyond the edges of the free lobes of the campanulate\r\nflower and look like marginal teeth, though they are actually\r\nattached on each side of the midrib and originally extended, as in\r\n_Cycadocephalus_, towards the centre of the funnel-shaped flower. The\r\nexamination of one of the type-specimens acquired by Nathorst[1313] for\r\nthe Stockholm Museum enabled him to confirm his earlier conclusion that\r\n_Weltrichia_ represents the male portion of a flower, whether unisexual\r\nor bisexual cannot be definitely determined, of a Bennettitalean\r\nplant. There is, as Nathorst states, a close agreement in plan between\r\n_Weltrichia_, _Cycadocephalus_, and _Williamsonia_, and indeed it is\r\nnot clear in what respects _Weltrichia_ is sufficiently distinct from\r\n_Cycadocephalus_ to be retained as a separate genus. Our knowledge\r\nof _Weltrichia_ is, however, less complete than in the case of\r\n_Cycadocephalus_ and _Williamsonia_. It is noteworthy that Braun’s\r\nspecimens and those on which _Cycadocephalus_ was founded were obtained\r\nfrom Rhaetic rocks. An account of _Weltrichia_ has also been published\r\nby Schuster[1314] who differs from Nathorst in his interpretation of\r\nthe type-specimens: he considers that another fossil described by\r\nBraun and named by him _Palaeoxyris microrhombea_ is the central,\r\nfemale, portion of a _Weltrichia_ flower, a view that is not supported\r\nby any substantial evidence. The specimens referred by Braun to\r\n_Palaeoxyris_ and afterwards transferred by Schimper[1315] to the genus\r\n_Lepidanthium_ are too obscurely preserved to be determined with any\r\ndegree of confidence, and their connexion with _Weltrichia_ is purely\r\nhypothetical. With _Weltrichia_ Schuster also connects the fronds\r\nknown as _Otozamites brevifolius_ Braun and some impressions of stems,\r\ncombining all in a restoration of a complete _Weltrichia_ plant which\r\nrests more on imagination than on fact. Attention has elsewhere[1316]\r\nbeen called to some wholly misleading and incorrect statements made by\r\nSchuster which vitiate the value of his descriptions.\r\n\r\nSaporta[1317] described a species of _Weltrichia_, _W. Fabrei_. from\r\nFrench Rhaetic strata at Mende (Lozère) which bears at least a close\r\nsuperficial resemblance to _Williamsonia spectabilis_, and the same\r\nauthor founded another species, _Weltrichia oolithica_, on a drawing by\r\nZigno of a specimen from Jurassic rocks in Italy; but this appears to\r\nbe too imperfect for accurate identification.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said as to the nature of _Weltrichia_, as illustrated\r\nby the type-species, is that it represents a Rhaetic example of a\r\nverticil of microsporophylls very similar to those of _Williamsonia_\r\nand _Cycadocephalus_, if not generically identical with the latter form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                             CYCADOPHYTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n              +I. Cycadean Stems other than Cycadeoidea.+\r\n\r\nMost of the stems now under consideration are represented by casts\r\nor impressions and afford no information with regard to anatomical\r\ncharacters. They are in many cases more slender and less tuberous than\r\ntypical Cycadeoideas, and a few are characterised by an irregular\r\nform of branching, as is shown in some specimens of pith-casts from\r\nWealden strata in Tilgate Forest figured by Mantell[1318] and now in\r\nthe British Museum. The genus _Wielandiella_[1319] (fig. 566) is an\r\naltogether distinct type represented by flowers as well as vegetative\r\norgans. Several generic names have been proposed for Cycadean stems\r\nagreeing with those of many recent Cycads in the possession of an\r\narmour of persistent leaf-bases, but distinguished from _Cycadeoidea_\r\nin the absence of any fertile lateral shoots intercalated among the\r\npetiole-bases. It is, however, impossible in most cases to give any\r\nsatisfactory definition by which these genera can be distinguished\r\nfrom one another; the characters employed by Carruthers[1320],\r\nSaporta[1321], and other authors are of comparatively little\r\nimportance as trustworthy criteria and to a large extent are merely\r\nthe expression of different states of preservation or of differences\r\nin age. Attention has elsewhere been called to the absence of any\r\nclear dividing line between stems referred to _Bucklandia_, _Yatesia_,\r\n_Fittonia_ and _Cylindropodium_. The species _Cycadeoidea gigantea_\r\ndescribed on a previous page affords an instructive example of the\r\ndifficulty of drawing a generic distinction between certain types of\r\nCycadean stems: in habit, in the form and structure of the leaf-bases,\r\nand in the ramenta this species is identical with other species of\r\n_Cycadeoidea_, but it differs in the absence of lateral fertile shoots,\r\na feature that may have no morphological significance. It has already\r\nbeen pointed out that the absence of flowers intercalated among the\r\nleaf-bases may simply mean that the plant had not reached the stage of\r\nflower-production, or their absence may be due to some unfavourable\r\nconditions. Similarly the stems for which Saporta proposed the generic\r\nname _Clathropodium_ agree in every respect with _Cycadeoidea_ except\r\nin the absence, apparent or real, of lateral flowering branches.\r\nSuch types as _Clathropodium foratum_ Sap. and _C. sarlatense_\r\nSap.[1322], the latter probably from Upper Jurassic beds and the\r\nformer from an unknown locality, should be included in the genus\r\n_Cycadeoidea_. The stem referred by Saporta to his genus _Platylepis_\r\nas _P. micromyela_[1323] was originally assigned to _Cycadeoidea_ and\r\nmore recently Lignier has wisely adopted the original generic name.\r\nThe generic term _Bolpopodium_, also instituted by Saporta[1324], is\r\napplied to small tuberous stems which appear to be identical with the\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ type.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the meagre data supplied by casts of stems preserved\r\nin various stages of defoliation, and in view of the impossibility\r\nof drawing other than purely arbitrary generic distinctions, it is\r\npreferable to employ one generic name in a liberal sense for stems\r\nthat there is good reason to regard as plants that cannot reasonably\r\nbe referred to _Cycadeoidea_. The name _Bucklandia_ is thus employed,\r\nand a few examples are described in illustration of the external\r\nfeatures of stems that are undoubtedly Cycadean but in most cases\r\nreadily distinguished from _Cycadeoidea_. There are substantial grounds\r\nfor stating that plants which bore flowers of the _Williamsonia_\r\ntype possessed stems having the characters of _Bucklandia_. It\r\nshould, however, be remembered that we cannot always draw a clearly\r\ndefined distinction between flowers included in _Williamsonia_ and\r\n_Bennettites_, or _Cycadeoidea_, particularly when they are represented\r\nonly by detached ovulate strobili as in _Cycadeoidea_ (_Bennettites_)\r\n_Morierei_ and _Williamsonia scotica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BUCKLANDIA.= Presl.\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia_ was proposed by Presl[1325] for a plant described by\r\nMantell[1326] from the Wealden of Tilgate Forest and compared by him\r\nto the Euphorbiaceae and arborescent Ferns; the same generic name was\r\ngiven by Robert Brown in 1832 to a recent member of the Hamamelidaceae.\r\nStokes and Webb[1327] referred the same fossil to _Clathraria_, a name\r\napplied by Brongniart[1328] to certain types of Sigillarian stems and\r\nafterwards adopted by him for the Tilgate Forest species, _C. Lyelli_.\r\nPresl ‘with remarkable discrimination’ recognised the Cycadean nature\r\nof the specimen. Carruthers[1329] in his definition of _Bucklandia_\r\nincludes a statement as to the nature of the carpellary leaves and\r\nsuggests that a cone associated with the stems may be a staminate\r\nstrobilus: the cone is undoubtedly a megastrobilus of an Araucarian\r\nplant and there is no evidence with regard to the nature of either the\r\nmale or female reproductive organs in the material that he describes\r\nthough, as already pointed out, there are reasons for believing\r\nthat _Williamsonia_ flowers were borne on branches of _Bucklandia_\r\nstems. The flowering shoots were not short and intercalated among\r\nthe petiole-bases as in _Cycadeoidea_ with the strobili barely\r\nprojecting beyond the surface of the leaf-base armour, but they formed\r\ncomparatively long branches, sometimes forked, at the apex of the main\r\nstem (_cf._ figs. 541–543).\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia_ is usually represented by casts, from Rhaetic to Lower\r\nCretaceous strata, differing from _Cycadeoidea_ in the absence of\r\nnumerous axillary short fertile shoots, in the more slender form and\r\ngreater length of the stems, and in the less uniform size of the\r\npersistent leaf-bases which assume various forms. Some of the specimens\r\nreach a length of 4 feet and afford evidence of occasional branching:\r\nthe surface is covered with leaf-bases preserved as imbricate, broad,\r\nand obtuse or truncate scales (fig. 575), or as slightly convex\r\npolygonal areas in some cases showing a tendency towards an irregular\r\nzonal arrangement of larger and smaller leaf-bases (fig. 576). Within\r\nthe armour of leaf-bases there may be a cast of the large pith the\r\nsurface-features of which are practically identical with the cast of\r\na recent pith reproduced in fig. 398. Casts of the pith preserved as\r\nseparate fossils are included in the genus _Cycadeomyelon_.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of the occurrence of more than one zone of vascular\r\ntissue in a stem from Lower Greensand beds of Bedfordshire described by\r\nCarruthers as _Yatesia Morrisii_[1330] (= _Bucklandia Yatesii_), and\r\nDr Stopes[1331] has recently described a species, _B. buzzardensis_\r\n(fig. 578), with several zones of conducting tissue. This feature has\r\nnot so far been satisfactorily demonstrated in _Cycadeoidea_. An Indian\r\nspecies, _Bucklandia indica_, shows that the secondary xylem is more\r\ncompact than in typical _Cycadeoidea_ stems, and the tracheids have\r\nmultiseriate pitting.\r\n\r\nTwo long and narrow stems figured by Nathorst from the Rhaetic of\r\nScania as _Bucklandia Saportana_[1332] differ from other species in\r\nthe irregular arrangement of the leaf-bases which in certain regions\r\nare crowded as in the typical example of the genus shown in fig. 576,\r\nbut in the intervening portions of the stem they are few in number\r\nand widely separated by the finely striated bark. This type, though\r\nsimilar to some specimens of English, Mexican, and Indian Bucklandias\r\nin the zonal differences in the leaf-bases, represents an extreme case\r\nof the alternation of smaller and crowded and larger and scattered\r\nleaf-scars. It is by no means unlikely that _Bucklandia Saportana_\r\nforms a transition between _Bucklandia_ and the stem of _Wielandiella_\r\ndescribed by Nathorst from the same region: in _Wielandiella_ the\r\nleaf-scars are concentrated at the region of forking but a few occur\r\nelsewhere: in _B. Saportana_ there is no evidence of branching and in\r\nthis respect it differs from _Wielandiella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia anomala_ (Stokes and Webb).\r\n\r\nThis species, from Wealden beds in Sussex, was first described by\r\nStokes and Webb[1333] as _Clathraria anomala_, and the same type was\r\nfigured by Mantell and other authors as _Clathraria Lyelli_. The\r\nspecimens referred by Carruthers to _Bucklandia anomala_ and _B.\r\nMantelli_[1334] do not exhibit any well defined specific differences,\r\nand there would seem to be no reason for retaining both specific\r\nnames. The petiole-bases are usually sub-rhomboidal in form and convex\r\nor flat, but in some stems more of each petiole is preserved and the\r\nsurface is covered with broad imbricate scales (fig. 575) similar\r\nto some of the detached scales described under the generic name\r\n_Cycadolepis_. Pith-casts occur both in connexion with the _Bucklandia_\r\nstems and as detached specimens. The leaf-bases often show an irregular\r\nzonation of smaller and larger rhomboidal areas. The pith-cast in the\r\nlower part of the specimen from the Wealden of Cuckfield in Sussex\r\nshown in fig. 575 is 5 × 3·5 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 575. _Bucklandia anomala._ (British Museum, No.\r\nV. 3690; rather less than natural size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia Ruffordi_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThis species, from the Wealden beds on the Sussex coast[1335], was\r\noriginally described as _Fittonia Ruffordi_, but in the absence of\r\nany well defined distinctive features that can be regarded as of\r\nmorphological significance it is better to include it in _Bucklandia_.\r\nThe species affords a good example of a long and narrow type of stem,\r\none specimen reaching a length of nearly 80 cm. with a breadth of\r\nabout 10 cm.; the surface is covered with persistent leaf-bases 1·7\r\ncm. in depth with a scar agreeing in size and shape with the base of\r\na frond of _Otozamites Goeppertianus_ (Dunk.)[1336] found in the same\r\nbeds. There is no indication of any alternation of large and small\r\nleaf-bases, and the species is characterised by the uniform size and\r\nrelatively greater depth in a vertical direction of the leaf-base\r\nareas. In all probability the stem bore fertile branches similar to\r\nthose of _Williamsonia gigas_ with flowers of the _Williamsonia_ type:\r\nthe fronds may have been those known as _Otozamites Goeppertianus_, but\r\nthis has not been demonstrated. A stem described by Carruthers from the\r\nLias of Lyme Regis as _Yatesia gracilis_[1337] and afterwards included\r\nby me in _Cycadeoidea_[1338] is very similar to _B. Ruffordi_ in its\r\nlong and narrow form and in the shape of the leaf-bases; it should be\r\ntransferred to _Bucklandia_ as _B. gracilis_ (Carr.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia Milleriana_ Carruthers.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on a cast from Lower Oolite beds at Brora\r\nin Sutherlandshire[1339] characterised by leaf-bases very similar to\r\nthose of _B. anomala_ but smaller. Casts from the same locality were\r\nnamed by Carruthers _Yatesia crassa_ and _Y. Joassiana_[1340], but an\r\nexamination of specimens in the Dunrobin Museum leads me to regard\r\nthese forms as indistinguishable from _B. Milleriana_. The specimen\r\nreproduced in fig. 576 from the Great Oolite of Brora illustrates the\r\nexternal characters of a typical stem and shows the variation in the\r\nsize of the leaf-bases. A portion of the pith-cast is exposed in the\r\nlower part of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 576. _Bucklandia Milleriana._ Brora, Scotland.\r\n(Manchester Museum, L. 7229. _ca._ ½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia Yatesii_ (Carruthers).\r\n\r\nThis type from the Lower Greensand of Bedfordshire (fig. 577) was\r\ndescribed by Carruthers as _Cycadeoidea Yatesii_ and subsequently\r\nnamed _Yatesia Morrisii_[1341]. Ward expressed the opinion that the\r\nname should be _Yatesia Yatesii_, but as _Bucklandia_ is now used\r\nto include _Yatesia_ this combination is fortunately avoided. The\r\nstem is cylindrical, 20–30 cm. long and 12 cm. in diameter, covered\r\nwith rhomboidal leaf-bases separated from one another by a ramental\r\nreticulum. There are two concentric vascular cylinders as stated by\r\nCarruthers. In a recent account of this species Dr Stopes[1342] adds\r\nfurther details: the xylem-cylinders are 5–8 mm. wide and the tracheids\r\noccur in single rows or there may be bands 4–5 elements broad; the\r\ncircular bordered pits are uniseriate or in two alternate series.\r\nThe medullary rays are broad but the cells are not preserved. The\r\npith-cast is of the usual Cycadean type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 577. _Bucklandia Yatesii._ Type-specimen in the\r\nBritish Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen was presented by the Cirencester College to the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia buzzardensis_ (Stopes).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 578. _Bucklandia buzzardensis._ Rough sketch of a\r\nblock of wood showing parts of at least eight concentrically arranged\r\nrings of secondary wood. (After Stopes; × ⅔.)]\r\n\r\nThis species, from Lower Greensand beds at Leighton Buzzard and\r\nbelieved to be derived from Wealden strata, is described by Dr\r\nStopes[1343] as _Cycadeoidea buzzardensis_. Though agreeing generally\r\nwith _B. Yatesii_, the stem is specifically separated on the ground\r\nthat the petiole-bases are more expanded laterally and because of the\r\noccurrence of several vascular cylinders (fig. 578), sometimes as many\r\nas eight, each with a maximum diameter of 1 cm. Dr Stopes thinks it\r\npossible that _B. buzzardensis_ is an older form of _B. Yatesii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia squamosa_ (Brongniart).\r\n\r\nSternberg first described this species as _Conites Bucklandi_[1344] and\r\nregarded it as a cone bearing large imbricate cone-scales; it was named\r\nby Brongniart _Bucklandia squamosa_[1345] and Carruthers[1346] retained\r\nthis designation. The type-specimen, in the Oxford Museum, from the\r\nStonesfield Slate is 18 cm. long, showing in the lower part a cast\r\nof the pith. The surface of the stem is covered with thick imbricate\r\npetiole-bases very like those on the stem of a recent _Encephalartos_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia_ (_Fittonia_) _squamata_ (Carruthers).\r\n\r\nCarruthers[1347] founded the genus _Fittonia_ on a single specimen from\r\nthe Wealden beds of the Isle of Wight, separating it from _Bucklandia_\r\non the ground of the occurrence on a portion of the stem of large\r\nimbricate leaf-bases which are at first reflexed and then ascending;\r\nthe stem is also broader and more tuberous than most species of\r\n_Bucklandia_. The type-specimen, in the Museum of the Geological Survey\r\n(Jermyn street), bears a close resemblance to a trunk of a recent\r\n_Encephalartos_, but the part of the stem from which the imbricate\r\nstumps have fallen is practically identical with a _Bucklandia_.\r\nAs in certain recent Cycads the surface-features probably changed\r\nwith the age of the plant; when the foliage-leaves were first shed\r\na portion of the ascending petiole remained on the stem, and at a\r\nlater stage this was cut off leaving a clean-cut rhomboidal scar like\r\nthose on the _Bucklandia_ shown in fig. 576. The difference between\r\n_Fittonia_ and _Bucklandia_ may, therefore, be a question of age. While\r\nsubstituting _Bucklandia_ for _Fittonia_ as the generic name the latter\r\ndesignation is added in parentheses to denote the possession of certain\r\nfeatures which, though possibly of generic value, are not regarded as\r\nsufficiently important morphologically to warrant generic recognition.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen of Saporta’s species _Fittonia insignis_[1348],\r\nin the Paris Museum, from the Oxfordian of Poitiers, appears hardly\r\ndistinguishable from _F. squamata_ Carr. Another type with broader\r\nimbricate petiole stumps is described by Saporta from the Portlandian\r\nnear Boulogne as _Fittonia Rigauxi_[1349].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 579. _Bucklandia indica._ A, side-view showing\r\nthe leaf-bases and attached petioles of _Ptilophyllum_, also (to the\r\nleft) a fragment of a detached _Ptilophyllum_ leaf. B, transverse\r\nsection showing the pith, xylem cylinder, cortex, and sections of\r\npetioles. (British Museum; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bucklandia indica_ sp. nov.\r\n\r\nOldham and Morris[1350] and subsequently Feistmantel[1351] described\r\nsome specimens of Cycadean stems from the Rajmahal Hills of India\r\nof Lower Jurassic age: the latter author regarded them as stems of\r\n_Williamsonia_ because of their association with flowers of that\r\ntype, a conclusion fully justified by the evidence. Feistmantel also\r\ncalled attention to the resemblance of the Indian stems to specimens\r\ndescribed from British strata as _Bucklandia_ and _Yatesia_. Although\r\nthe Indian examples are very similar to stems from Mexico discovered\r\nby Wieland[1352] and to some of the English types, it seems desirable\r\nto refer to them under a specific name and I therefore suggest the\r\ninstitution of the specific name _indica_, the type-specimen being that\r\nrepresented in fig. 579. This specimen is particularly interesting\r\nbecause it affords some information as to anatomical features and\r\nis one of the few fossil stems preserved in organic connexion\r\nwith leaves (fig. 579, B). A short account of it was published in\r\n1900[1353] and more recently Miss Bancroft[1354] has made a fuller\r\ninvestigation of this and other Indian specimens. The stem shown in\r\nfig. 579 from the Rajmahal Hills, and now in the British Museum, bears\r\nfronds of _Ptilophyllum cutchense_ Morr., a type that appears to be\r\nindistinguishable from _P. pecten_; and with similar stems from the\r\nsame beds are associated flowers of _Williamsonia_. Miss Bancroft\r\ndescribes a bract-covered shoot which agrees very closely with those of\r\nEnglish stems reproduced in figs. 541, 542. In addition to the evidence\r\nbased on close association, there is the more important argument\r\nfurnished by the discovery of ramental hairs like those on the bracts\r\nof _Williamsonia scotica_ and of anatomical characters in the bracts\r\nsimilar to those in the Scotch strobilus. The persistent leaf-bases\r\nare far from uniform in size; in this respect and in their form they\r\nagree closely with those on _Bucklandia_ stems from English and Mexican\r\nlocalities. The secondary wood is more compact than in recent Cycads or\r\nin _Cycadeoidea_, though it resembles that of _Cycadeoidea micromyela_;\r\nthe medullary rays are uniseriate and the tracheids have multiseriate\r\nbordered pits on their radial walls instead of the scalariform pitting\r\nin the majority of _Cycadeoidea_ stems. Secretory canals are abundant\r\nin the parenchymatous ground-tissue; the cambium and phloem are not\r\npreserved[1355].\r\n\r\nThe transparent nature of the silicified material rendered very\r\ndifficult the examination of the tissues, but enough was discovered\r\nto show that these Indian stems are characterised by certain\r\nfeatures, the more compact nature of the secondary xylem and the\r\npresence of multiseriate pitting, which distinguish them from the\r\n_Cycadeoidea_ type. Further knowledge of the anatomical features of the\r\n_Williamsonia_ (_Bucklandia_) stems from other localities might enable\r\nus to recognise these or other peculiarities as constant distinguishing\r\ncharacters of _Bucklandia_ in contrast to the Cycadeoidea stems which\r\nbore the _Bennettites_ type of flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cycadeomyelon.= Saporta.\r\n\r\nCasts of the pith-cavity of Cycadean stems, like that shown in fig. 575\r\nprojecting beyond the armour of leaf-bases, are occasionally found as\r\nseparate fossils and cannot always be referred to a particular species\r\nof stem. For such detached casts Saporta[1356] instituted the name\r\n_Cycadeomyelon_: they are characterised by their comparatively large\r\ndiameter and by the possession of surface-features similar to those\r\non the corresponding cast from a recent Cycadean stem shown in fig.\r\n398, namely spirally disposed, more or less prominent, lozenge-shaped\r\nareas formed by the sand or mud filling the cavities left on the decay\r\nof the parenchyma of the broad medullary rays of a manoxylic stem.\r\nOccasionally a slit at the lower end of a medullary ray area marks the\r\nposition of the leaf-trace bending outwards from the lower angle of the\r\nmesh in the xylem-lattice[1357]. Lignier figures part of a pith-cast of\r\n_Cycadeomyelon Apperti_[1358] in which each medullary-ray area has a\r\ncircular depression and not a slit extending from the lower angle: this\r\nmay indicate that the surface shown on the cast is slightly external to\r\nthe inner edge of the stele and in a plane where the leaf-traces were\r\nembedded in the parenchyma of the rays and free from the xylem-cylinder.\r\n\r\nLarge and branched examples of _Cycadeomyelon_ were figured by some\r\nof the earlier authors from English Wealden beds as species of\r\n_Clathraria_[1359] and in many cases these are undoubtedly pith-casts\r\nof _Bucklandia_ stems: a similar cast is figured under this name by\r\nSchenk from the Wealden of North Germany. From Liassic beds in Normandy\r\nLignier figures two species of _Cycadeomyelon_, _C. Apperti_ and _C.\r\ndensecristatum_. The surface-features of _Cycadeomyelon_ resemble\r\nthose of the Palaeozoic genus _Tylodendron_ (see Vol. +iv.+), but in\r\nthe latter genus the nodal swellings are a characteristic peculiarity.\r\nThough medullary casts of this type are of no great botanical\r\nimportance and their specific distinctions are of little value, it is\r\nsafe to assume that broad medullary casts with comparatively large\r\nlozenge-shaped areas belong to Cycadean stems, while narrower specimens\r\nwith smaller lozenges are more likely to be pith-casts of Coniferous\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nLester Ward[1360] instituted the genus _Feistmantelia_ for some Lower\r\nCretaceous casts from the Black Hills which he compared with an\r\nIndian fossil from Cutch described by Feistmantel as ‘the stem of a\r\nConiferous plant[1361],’ and with pith-casts figured by Stokes and Webb\r\nas _Clathraria anomala_. It is impossible to determine the systematic\r\nposition of such imperfect specimens as that on which Ward founded his\r\nspecies _F. oblonga_: they may, as Hollick and Jeffrey[1362] suggest,\r\nbe casts of the bark of some Conifer; there is certainly no good reason\r\nfor connecting them with Cycads.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COLYMBETES.= Stopes.\r\n\r\n_Colymbetes Edwardsi_ Stopes. This genus[1363] is founded on the\r\ninner portion of a petrified trunk which was probably cylindrical\r\nand more than 12 cm. in diameter, consisting of a pith, 7·5 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and part of a vascular cylinder of remarkable structure.\r\nThe type-specimen is of Aptian age and may have come from Leighton\r\nBuzzard (Bedfordshire). The pith (fig. 580, _p_) consists of large\r\nparenchymatous cells and numerous secretory canals: the perimedullary\r\nzone, _pm_, is characterised by the occurrence of loosely disposed\r\ntracheids in groups and radial rows pursuing a sinuous longitudinal\r\ncourse in the accompanying parenchyma. The tracheids in this region\r\nare small in diameter and have oval, scalariform, or circular pits.\r\nAbutting on the perimedullary zone is the secondary xylem the inner\r\nedge of which forms bays, and this is composed of alternating zones of\r\nvertical and horizontal tracheids (fig. 580, _y₁_–_x₅_; fig. 581) with\r\nbordered, scalariform, pits on their walls traversed by medullary rays\r\ngenerally biseriate and from 4 to 30 cells deep. The disposition of\r\nthe tracheids is such as to render transverse and radial longitudinal\r\nsections practically identical in appearance; the first zone of\r\nsecondary xylem with its bayed inner edge consists of vertically\r\nrunning elements; this is succeeded by a zone in which the tracheids\r\npursue a horizontal course, and beyond this second zone is another\r\nband of vertical elements (fig. 581). ‘Where the one zone passes\r\ninto the next, a curving of the elements is frequently evident, and\r\nin a few cases it is quite possible to trace a single radial series\r\nof tracheids through an angle of 90° running in the same section,\r\nfirst as a transverse and then as a vertical series. One and the same\r\nmedullary ray also can sometimes be followed, first in transverse and\r\nthen in radial longitudinal section, which later again turns to true\r\ntransverse. The inference is therefore drawn that there was but a\r\nsingle cambium, which had periodic changes of direction.’ Leaf-traces\r\n(fig. 580, _lt_) are large and numerous; they are spirally disposed\r\nand pass nearly straight through successive xylem-zones: each trace\r\nconsists of a small-celled ground-tissue including stone-cells and\r\npatches of tracheids in more or less regular radial rows. Tangential\r\nsections of the wood show that the tracheids follow a sinuous course\r\nforming loops enclosing numerous medullary rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 580. _Colymbetes Edwardsi_. Transverse section\r\nshowing ten alternating zones of wood outside the perimedullary zone,\r\n_pm_; _y₁_, _y₂_, etc., vertically running xylem series; _x₁_, _x₂_,\r\netc., horizontally running xylem series; _p_, pith; _lt_, leaf-traces.\r\n(After Stopes; × 2.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 581. _Colymbetes Edwardsi._ Diagram of stem in\r\ntransverse (A) and radial longitudinal (B) section. _p_, pith; _pm_,\r\nperimedullary xylem; _b_, bays of first, vertically running, secondary\r\nxylem; _x₁_, _x₂_, etc., zones of horizontally running secondary\r\nxylem cut transversely in the radial and radially in the transverse\r\nsection of the stem; _y₁_, _y₂_, etc., longitudinally running xylem\r\ncut transversely in the transverse and longitudinally in the radial\r\nsection. (After Stopes.)]\r\n\r\nAs the pith and xylem are the only tissues preserved it is on their\r\nstructure that any speculation as to affinity must be based. The close\r\narrangement of the leaf-traces (about 1 cm. apart), as Dr Stopes says,\r\nindicates small leaf-bases, assuming that each leaf received a single\r\ntrace. In some respects the xylem and medullary rays resemble those of\r\nCycads, and the author of the genus includes it in the Cycadophyta; but\r\nas she points out there are many peculiar features, and it is clearly\r\nimpossible to assign the new type to a more precisely defined position.\r\nThe possibility of any purely mechanical explanation of the course of\r\nthe tracheids in the alternating zones is ruled out by the straight\r\ncourse of the outgoing leaf-traces, and it would seem that the cambium\r\nmust have turned over at right-angles at regular intervals during the\r\ngrowth of the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cycadolepis.= Saporta.\r\n\r\nThis name was used by Saporta[1364] for linear-lanceolate scales from\r\nUpper Jurassic rocks in France which he compared with bud-scales of\r\nrecent Cycads. The imperfect scale described as _Cycadolepis villosa_\r\nbears a striking resemblance to the hairy bracts of _Williamsonia_\r\nand may well belong to that genus. Saporta’s term may be usefully\r\nemployed in a more extended sense, including not only lanceolate\r\nscales but larger and much broader scales resembling the flattened\r\npetiole-bases on stems of _Macrozamia_, _Encephalartos_, and some\r\nother recent genera, as well as detached carpellary scales, other\r\nthan _Cycadospadix_, and microsporophylls which cannot be assigned\r\nto a particular stem. Two qualifying subgeneric terms have been\r\nproposed[1365]:\r\n\r\ni. _Cycadolepis_ (_Dory-Cycadolepis_). Scales more or less\r\nlinear-lanceolate like those described by Saporta and a specimen\r\nfrom Jurassic rocks of India named by Feistmantel[1366] _Cycadolepis\r\npilosa_. This type of _Cycadolepis_ may be identical with the bracts of\r\n_Williamsonia_ flowers, though in the absence of any definite evidence\r\nof such affinity the provisional generic name is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nii. _Cycadolepis_ (_Eury-Cycadolepis_). Broadly oval or orbicular thick\r\nscales (figs. 582, 583), the broadest part being frequently nearer the\r\ndistal than the proximal end. These larger scales though usually found\r\nas detached fossils have in one instance been obtained attached to an\r\nimperfectly preserved stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 582. _Cycadolepis_ (_Eury-Cycadolepis_) sp. From\r\nthe Wealden beds of Sussex. (Brit. Mus. No. V. 2799.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 583. _Cycadolepis_ (_Eury-Cycadolepis_) sp. Scale\r\nfrom the Wealden beds of Sussex. (British Museum, No. V. 2131_a_; nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eury-Cycadolepis_ sp.\r\n\r\nThis type of scale, represented by specimens from the Wealden of\r\nSussex[1367] (figs. 582, 583), reaches a length of 13 cm. and a breadth\r\nof 7 cm. and is sometimes almost orbicular. The lamina is convex\r\nbut shows no definite venation and bears a close resemblance to the\r\nscale-like petiole-stumps on an old stem of _Macrozamia_. On some of\r\nthe smaller specimens (fig. 583) several forked veins extend vertically\r\nfrom the broad base. Since these specimens were first described\r\nadditional examples have been discovered in the Wealden beds of Sussex,\r\nsome of which are attached to a piece of stem[1368] in such a manner\r\nas to give support to the view that they are leaf-bases very similar\r\nto those on such fossil stems as _Bucklandia_ (_Fittonia_) _Rigauxi_\r\n(Sap.)[1369] and _B._ (_Fittonia_) _squamata_ (Carr.)[1370]. One\r\npartially carbonised scale yielded pieces of cuticle showing numerous\r\nstomata similar to those of recent Cycads and the outlines of very\r\nthick-walled epidermal cells[1371].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eury-Cycadolepis Jenkinsiana_ (Tate).\r\n\r\nThe large and approximately orbicular or broadly ovate scales\r\nso named are believed to be identical with Tate’s _Cyclopteris\r\nJenkinsiana_[1372] from the Uitenhage series of Cape Colony (Wealden).\r\nThe scales reach a length of 12 cm. and were attached by a broad base;\r\nthe lamina, which may be strongly bent as though folded over some\r\nimmature organ as a protective bract, shows numerous repeatedly forked\r\nveins of the _Cyclopteris_ type and several anastomosing and irregular\r\nlines between the veins suggesting that the scales were tomentose.\r\n\r\n\r\n           +II. Reproductive Organs of Cycadean Plants other\r\n                   than those of the Bennettitales.+\r\n\r\nThe fact that practically all known Cycadean stems bore flowers\r\neither of the _Bennettites_ or _Williamsonia_ type prepares us for\r\nthe scarcity of reproductive organs like those of recent Cycads. No\r\nspecimens have been discovered in a petrified state affording any\r\nevidence of their close affinity to the cones, sporophylls, or seeds\r\nof the Cycadales. Such genera as _Cycadospadix_, _Androstrobus_,\r\nand _Zamiostrobus_, as the following descriptions show, are founded\r\non material that is too imperfect to throw much light on their true\r\nmorphological nature. The probability is that some at least of the\r\nspecimens included in these genera are the reproductive organs of\r\nCycadean plants more closely allied to the existing Cycads than to\r\nthe Bennettitales. Among the numerous fossil seeds referred to such\r\ngenera as _Cycadeospermum_ and _Cycadinocarpus_ there are but few\r\nthat can confidently be assigned to the Cycadales rather than to the\r\nGinkgoales or Coniferales. While the seeds of the Bennettitales are\r\nclearly distinguished by their much smaller size from those of modern\r\nCycads, many of the latter agree in size and form with those of some\r\nother Gymnosperms and in the absence of anatomical details could\r\nnot easily be identified as fossils. Some of the examples included\r\nin the miscellaneous collection described by authors as species of\r\n_Carpolithus_ or _Carpolithes_ agree closely in external features with\r\nthe seeds of modern Cycads, but it is seldom possible to accept them as\r\nundoubted records of Cycadalean plants.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion is that such meagre evidence as we possess\r\naffords strong confirmation of the conclusion based on stems and\r\nfoliage from Jurassic and Cretaceous strata, namely that the present\r\nrepresentatives of the Cycadophyta are a relatively late product of\r\nevolution, though retaining in their anatomical features many survivals\r\nfrom a remote antiquity. The occurrence of Cycadean characteristics in\r\nthe vegetative organs of the Medulloseae and the recurrence of what may\r\nbe called the Cycadean seed-plan, with certain more or less striking\r\npeculiarities reminiscent of earlier stages of evolution, in several\r\ntypes of Palaeozoic seeds such as _Cycadinocarpus_, _Stephanospermum_,\r\n_Lagenostoma_ and others bear testimony to the antiquity of the\r\nCycadean stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CARPOLITHUS[1373].= Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nThis generic name, as Nathorst[1374] has recently pointed out, was\r\nused by Linnaeus in 1768 for ‘Phytolithus fructus’ and has therefore\r\npriority over Sternberg’s genus _Carpolites_ employed in 1825. Lester\r\nWard[1375] attributes _Carpolithus_ to Stokes and Webb (1824) and\r\nstates that in the plural form the name was used by Walch in 1771.\r\n_Carpolithus_ is a convenient term to apply to fossil seeds that cannot\r\nbe assigned to a particular group of plants and which do not exhibit\r\nany peculiarities of form sufficiently striking to deserve generic\r\nrecognition. Pomel[1376] proposed the genus _Ulospermum_ but it never\r\ncame into general use. Schimper’s genus _Cycadinocarpus_ and Saporta’s\r\n_Cycadeospermum_ (preferable in its morphological implication),\r\nthough useful in the case of detached seeds of undoubted Cycadean\r\naffinity, can seldom be employed without an admission that they may\r\nimply a relationship that cannot be absolutely established. In the\r\ngreat majority of cases the better plan is to be content with the more\r\nnon-committal term _Carpolithus_ with the addition of a family-name\r\nwhen there are reasonably good grounds for a more definite reference.\r\nNo useful purpose would be served by attempting a complete survey of\r\nthe numerous casts and impressions of supposed Cycadean seeds recorded\r\nin palaeobotanical literature, but a few types are briefly described as\r\nexamples of specimens with fairly well defined characters, which are in\r\nall probability Cycadean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carpolithus conicus_ (Cycadales?) Lindley and Hutton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 584. _Carpolithus conicus._ The type-specimens in\r\nthe Manchester Museum; nat. size. (_a_, No. 361; _b_, _c_, No. 360.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 585. _Carpolithus conicus._ From a specimen in\r\nthe Malton Museum; nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe original specimen figured by Lindley and Hutton[1377] from the\r\nCoralline Oolite of Malton, Yorkshire, as _Carpolithes conica_\r\nand now in the Manchester Museum, is represented in fig. 584. A\r\nsecond ‘species,’ _Carpolithus Bucklandi_ Lind. and Hutt. ex Will.\r\n+MS.+[1378], from the same locality is no doubt specifically identical\r\nwith _C. conicus_. The seeds are conical, broadly truncate at one\r\nend, presumably the base, and tapered to a blunt apex; the broad end\r\nis characterised by the presence of three ridges or in some specimens\r\nby a single median ridge illustrating an oscillation between the\r\nradiospermic and platyspermic form similar to that in _Ginkgo biloba_.\r\nAs usually obtained the seeds are probably nucules or casts showing the\r\nsurface-features of the inner wall of the sclerotesta, the sarcotesta\r\nhaving been destroyed before fossilisation: the irregular marginal\r\nteeth at the truncate end suggest casts of vascular bundles in the\r\nintegument. The scattered tubercles on the sides of some of the seeds\r\n(fig. 584, _a_) are probably casts of holes in the shell bored by\r\ninsects and comparable with those occasionally preserved on the casts\r\nof _Trigonocarpus_. A specimen in the Malton Museum shown in fig. 585\r\nwhich may be an example of this species illustrates the occurrence\r\nof an internal cast enclosed by the remains of a thick testa. These\r\nJurassic casts resemble the seeds of _Macrozamia Fraseri_, but it is\r\nimpossible to determine their systematic position with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carpolithus_ sp. (Cycadales?) Seward.\r\n\r\nAn unusually well preserved specimen from the Wealden beds of the\r\nSussex coast described under this name in 1895[1379] consists of a\r\nkernel and mould, 1·8 × 1·1 cm. The mould from which the kernel is\r\nreadily removed is lined with a thin structure representing part of the\r\ntesta and between this and the surrounding rock is a layer of coal.\r\nOn the surface of the kernel, probably the cast of the seed-cavity,\r\na reticulum of narrow grooves indicates the course of the vascular\r\nbundles over the surface of the nucellus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carpolithus_ (Cycadales?) _Pomelii_ (Saporta).\r\n\r\nThe specimen from the Upper Corallian of Châteauroux (Indre) on\r\nwhich this species was founded by Saporta[1380] under the name\r\n_Cycadeospermum Pomelii_ is a large ovate cast, 5·5 cm. long and 3·5\r\ncm. broad, closely resembling some of the larger recent Cycadean seeds:\r\nit cannot be accepted as a true record of the group without reservation.\r\n\r\nSaporta describes other species of _Cycadeospermum_ but none of them\r\nare of any real importance from a botanical point of view: the same\r\nremark applies to the seeds referred by Fontaine[1381] from Potomac\r\nbeds to the same genus, also to many other recorded examples of seeds\r\nthat afford no decisive evidence of affinity.\r\n\r\nSome specimens described by Compter[1382] from the Lettenkohle of\r\nApolda (Thuringia) as Cycadean fruits—too imperfect to be determined\r\nwith accuracy—furnish an additional illustration of the slender\r\nfoundation on which many of the records of supposed Cycadean\r\nreproductive organs are based.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CYCADOSPADIX.= Schimper.\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed by Schimper[1383] for some French Jurassic\r\nfossils, described by Pomel[1384] as _Crossozamia Hennocquei_ and\r\n_C. Moraeana_, on the ground that they bear a close resemblance to\r\nthe megasporophylls of _Cycas_. Their occasional association with\r\n_Otozamites_ fronds suggested a reference to the same parent-plant, but\r\nsuch data as we have point to _Otozamites_ fronds having been borne\r\nby plants with the _Williamsonia_ type of flower. Schenk[1385], who\r\nfigured a specimen of _Cycadospadix_ from France as the inflorescence\r\nof a Cycad, expresses the more probable opinion that it belonged\r\nto a plant with _Cycadites_ fronds. A Permian species described by\r\nRenault as _Cycadospadix Milleryensis_ is now transferred to the genus\r\n_Strobilites_[1386].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadospadix Pasinianus_ Zigno.\r\n\r\nThis species, first described from Jurassic strata in Northern\r\nItaly[1387], is recorded also from the Kimmeridgian of France[1388] and\r\nScotland[1389]. Zigno’s figures give a fairly accurate representation\r\nof the type-specimens in the Padua Museum. The megasporophylls, almost\r\nidentical in shape with those of some recent species of _Cycas_ (figs.\r\n381; 392, A–C), consist of a broadly lanceolate or triangular limb\r\nwith deeply laciniate sides terminating a pedicel, or the distal\r\nexpansion may be preserved without the stalk from which it was no\r\ndoubt easily detached as in certain recent Cycads (_cf._ fig. 392, A).\r\nIn the specimen from Scotland there are no clear indications of veins\r\nin the lamina, which may have been woolly as in _Cycas_. In some of\r\nthe specimens figured by Saporta[1390] and now in the École des Mines,\r\nParis, the stalk is absent, but in pedicellate examples scars occur\r\non the sides of the narrow axis and casts of seeds are found in the\r\nsame beds. A good example of _Cycadospadix Hennocquei_ is figured by\r\nSaporta from a drawing supplied by Schimper showing two seed-scars\r\nnear the base of the lamina: the same specimen, as figured by Saporta\r\nand Marion[1391], bears a seed, but this is presumably a partial\r\nrestoration. The occurrence of _Cycadites rectangularis_ Brauns at\r\nHettange in association with _Cycadospadix_ strengthens the conclusion,\r\nbased on the form of the megasporophylls, that some of the Jurassic\r\nCycads bore megasporophylls very similar to those of existing species\r\nof _Cycas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadospadix integer_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis Rhaetic species from the south of Sweden[1392] was instituted\r\nfor an imperfect broadly lanceolate lamina recalling the distal end\r\nof the megasporophyll of a _Cycas_: the discovery of a more complete\r\nexample[1393] justifies Nathorst’s use of the name _Cycadospadix_,\r\nthough without further evidence one hesitates to regard the species as\r\na thoroughly trustworthy record of a Cycadean fertile leaf. The species\r\nis characterised by the entire margin of the broad and relatively short\r\nand thick terminal limb borne on a broad stalk with alternate lateral\r\nprojections presumably marking the position of the seeds.\r\n\r\nThese species of _Cycadospadix_ are particularly interesting as\r\nevidence—though not amounting to demonstration—of the production\r\nby some Jurassic and Rhaetic plants of fertile leaves agreeing\r\nclosely with those of _Cycas_. It would seem from the abundance of\r\nBennettitalean flowers and the very scanty remains of fertile leaves\r\nor cones like those of modern Cycads that the existing type was\r\nexceptional in Mesozoic floras.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BEANIA.= Carruthers.\r\n\r\n_Beania gracilis_ Carruthers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 586. _Beania gracilis._ (After Carruthers; ½ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Beania_[1394] was given to a branched fertile shoot\r\n(fig. 586) from the Middle Jurassic beds at Gristhorpe, Yorkshire,\r\ncharacterised by loosely disposed sporophylls bearing two sessile\r\nseeds: each sporophyll is given off at a wide angle from a fairly stout\r\naxis and the seeds are borne on the adaxial side of a peltate distal\r\nexpansion. Carruthers compared the type-species with a cone of _Zamia_\r\nwith which it agrees in the general plan of construction but differs\r\nin the more open habit and in the longer and more slender seed-bearing\r\npedicels. The same type of shoot was figured by Lindley and\r\nHutton[1395] as _Sphaereda paradoxa_. _Beania_ is generally regarded as\r\na Cycadean reproductive shoot, but there is no doubt that the majority\r\nof Jurassic Cycadophyta possessed flowers of the _Bennettites_ types,\r\nand it is clear that _Beania_ differs considerably from _Bennettites_\r\nand _Williamsonia_. Another suggestion is that _Beania_ may belong to\r\nsome member of the Ginkgoales[1396]: though very different from the\r\nnormal ovuliferous shoot of a _Ginkgo_, it resembles some abnormal\r\nforms (_e.g._ fig. 631, D) in which the ovules occur on elongated\r\npedicels, but they are borne singly and the micropyle is directed\r\noutwards, while in _Beania_ the ovules are attached in pairs to the\r\ninner face of a distal expansion. There is no conclusive evidence in\r\nsupport of either interpretation, though the general agreement between\r\nthe Jurassic type and the cones of recent Cycads would seem to favour\r\nthe inclusion of _Beania_ among the Cycadophyta.\r\n\r\nA specimen described by Nathorst[1397] from Upper Jurassic rocks in\r\nthe North of Scotland as _Beania Carruthersi_ closely resembles the\r\ntype-species, differing chiefly in its smaller size and in the rather\r\ncloser arrangement of the sporophylls. The seed-like bodies borne\r\nin pairs on the adaxial side of the terminally expanded pedicels\r\nare covered with small granulations which Nathorst thinks may be\r\nclusters of microspores, the apparent seeds being ‘antherangia.’ The\r\ngranulations are, however, very similar to those on the larger detached\r\nseed-like bodies originally described by Nathorst from Rhaetic beds\r\nin Sweden as _Antherangiopsis rediviva_[1398]: subsequent examination\r\nof that species demonstrated that the granulations are due to the\r\npresence of resinous bodies in the tissues of true seeds[1399], and\r\nit is not improbable that a similar interpretation may hold for the\r\nsurface-features in the supposed male organs of _Beania Carruthersi_.\r\nPending further evidence it may be suggested that _Beania Carruthersi_\r\nis like _B. gracilis_ a seed-bearing shoot. The Rhaetic specimens\r\ndescribed by Nathorst as _Stenorrachis scanicus_[1400] are similar in\r\nhabit to _Beania_ but differ in the forking of the sporophylls (fig.\r\n656) and in the absence of any terminal swelling on which the seeds are\r\nborne: Nathorst considers that _Stenorrachis_ may be the female organ\r\nof a _Nilssonia_ and it is not improbable that that genus and _Beania_\r\nare closely allied types. We have no definite information with regard\r\nto the reproductive organs of the Nilssoniales: the closer resemblance\r\nwhich their fronds bear in the structure of the epidermal cells to\r\nthose of recent Cycads is consistent with the view that their fertile\r\nshoots were also more like those of existing types. It is, however,\r\nstill an unsettled point whether _Beania_ is more closely allied to\r\nthe Cycadophyta or to the Ginkgoales, but the balance of opinion is in\r\nfavour of the former alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zamiostrobus.= Endlicher.\r\n\r\n=Cycadeostrobus.= Carruthers.\r\n\r\nThough instituted by Endlicher[1401] for a cone figured by Lindley\r\nand Hutton as _Zamia macrocephala_[1402] which is almost certainly\r\nAbietineous and has no claim to be included in the Cycadales, the genus\r\n_Zamiostrobus_ has been adopted by many authors for Cycadean ovulate\r\ncones, not only such as are believed to be closely allied to those of\r\n_Zamia_ but for Cycadean cones generally. Carruthers[1403] suggested\r\n_Cycadeostrobus_ as a more suitable name on the ground that it is less\r\nlimited in its implication of affinity; but, as Fliche points out,\r\nEndlicher’s generic name has been widely adopted in a comprehensive\r\nsense as standing for Cycadean megastrobili, excluding the supposed\r\n_Cycas_-like megasporophylls, included under _Cycadospadix_.\r\n\r\nMany of the specimens described as species of _Zamiostrobus_ are of\r\nlittle or no value as records of Cycadean plants, _e.g._ _Zamiostrobus\r\norientalis_ Heer[1404] from the Jurassic beds of Amurland. A\r\nLower Cretaceous (Albian) species described by Fliche[1405] as\r\n_Zamiostrobus Loppineti_, though not entirely satisfactory, is more\r\nlikely to belong to the Cycadales. The type-specimen is an elliptical\r\nstrobilus, 5·5 cm. × 3·2 cm., consisting of an axis bearing at\r\nright-angles numerous small, contiguous, peltate megasporophylls\r\neach with two small seeds on the lower surface. The figures given\r\nby Fliche are, however, not convincing. An examination of specimens\r\nin the British Museum, from Wealden and Jurassic rocks, described\r\nby Carruthers as species of _Cycadeostrobus_, convinced me that\r\nseveral are undoubtedly Araucarian cones[1406]. Solms-Laubach[1407]\r\ncalled attention to the Araucarian appearance of _Cycadeostrobus\r\nBrunonis_, a cone from an unknown locality, and this with other\r\nspecies, _e.g._ _C. elegans_, _C. sphaericus_, _C. truncatus_, etc.,\r\nmay safely be referred to _Araucarites_. The specimen figured by\r\nLindley and Hutton[1408] as _Zamia crassa_ from the Inferior Oolite\r\nof Towcester (Northamptonshire) affords no satisfactory evidence of\r\nCycadean affinity. The Lower Cretaceous Bohemian specimens described\r\nby Corda[1409] and Velenovský[1410] as _Microzamia gibba_ should not\r\nbe included in a genus implying Cycadean affinity: though Velenovský\r\nstates that the megasporophylls bear a pair of seeds his illustrations\r\ndo not afford any satisfactory evidence of this Cycadean character.\r\nSimilarly the fossil regarded by Carruthers[1411] as probably a male\r\nflower of _Bucklandia_ is almost certainly an Araucarian cone. A small\r\ncone from the Lower Miocene of Armissan (Aude) named by Schimper\r\n_Zamiostrobus Saportana_ and figured by Saporta and Marion[1412] may,\r\nas Solms-Laubach says, be Cycadean, but we have no information with\r\nregard to the internal structure or as to the presence or position of\r\nthe seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Androstrobus.= Schimper.\r\n\r\nSchimper[1413] instituted this genus for ‘amenta, cycadeacea\r\nantherifera, cylindrica, e squamis imbricatis, latere postico antheras\r\nsessiles ferentibus efformata.’ It may conveniently be applied to\r\nfossils which resemble the male cones of recent Cycads sufficiently\r\nto justify the use of a name implying relationship. As so defined,\r\n_Androstrobus_ is used in a more restricted sense than the word\r\nsuggests, just as _Masculostrobus_[1414] has been employed for fossils\r\nthat are believed to be the corresponding organs of Conifers. Among\r\nthe few species assigned to Schimper’s genus reference may be made to\r\n_A. Balduini_ Sap., originally named by Schimper _A. zamioides_, from\r\nthe Upper Bathonian of Etrochy, and _A. Guerangeri_ (Brongn.), another\r\nFrench type[1415]. Heer’s species _A. sibirica_[1416] of Jurassic age\r\nis represented by a slender axis bearing numerous appendages which in\r\nsurface-view have the form of polygonal discs: there are no indications\r\nof microsporangia and the evidence of Cycadean affinity is far from\r\nconvincing. Nathorst’s Rhaetic species _A. borealis_[1417] is no more\r\nsatisfactory as a record of a Cycadean strobilus. A fossil from the\r\nLower Cretaceous of Bohemia described as _Zamites familiaris_ and\r\nregarded by Corda[1418] and Carruthers[1419] as a male flower of a\r\nCycad though not above suspicion may be included in _Androstrobus_.\r\n\r\nUnder the name _Fričia nobilis_ Velenovský[1420] described some cones\r\nfrom the Lower Cretaceous plant-beds of Bohemia which he regards\r\nas male strobili of some Cycadean plant: the cone, as shown in\r\nVelenovský’s restoration, is 10 cm. long and 5 cm. in diameter; it\r\nbears a close superficial resemblance to a large cone of _Zamia_ and\r\nconsists of a stout axis bearing contiguous peltate, hexagonal, scales\r\ngradually contracted towards the proximal end, similar to those of\r\n_Androstrobus_. The evidence on which this species is identified as a\r\nmale cone rests on the occurrence of numerous pits on the surface of\r\nthe scales; but no spores or sporangia were found and the pits as shown\r\nin the published figures do not present the appearance of scars of\r\nsporangia.\r\n\r\nThe Rhaetic specimen originally named by Nathorst _Androstrobus Scotti_\r\nand afterwards transferred to the genus _Lycostrobus_ was described in\r\nVolume +ii.+[1421]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Androstrobus Nathorsti_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimens were obtained from the Wealden beds of Sussex: they\r\nwere referred to the genus _Androstrobus_ on evidence which cannot\r\nbe regarded as decisive[1422]. A fairly stout axis, 6·5 cm. long,\r\nbearing spirally disposed sub-triangular scales hexagonal in section\r\nand attached to the axis by a broad base; the scales, or sporophylls,\r\nare 1–1·5 cm. long and gradually tapered towards a pointed or slightly\r\nrounded apex. Near the proximal end of some of the sporophylls there\r\nare regularly arranged polygonal depressions which may be impressions\r\nof microsporangia. The regular disposition of the depressions is a\r\nstriking feature and in contrast to the less regular reticulum exposed\r\nafter the removal of the sporangia from the microsporophyll of a recent\r\nCycad. An examination of the cuticular membrane of the microsporophylls\r\nshows that the epidermal cells have thick and straight walls[1423],\r\ncharacters consistent with the supposed Cycadean affinity of the\r\nstrobilus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n                         CYCADOPHYTAN FRONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccasional reference is made to Cycadean fronds in the account of\r\nflowers and stems but it is seldom that genera or species founded\r\non leaves can be definitely correlated with particular types of\r\nreproductive organs or stems. As in the case of Ferns and Pteridosperms\r\nso also with detached leaves believed to be Cycadean, a large number\r\nof generic names have been employed for impressions which afford no\r\ninformation with regard to anatomical characters except, in some\r\nof the more favourably preserved specimens, a few facts as to the\r\nepidermal cells. Though association often suggests original connexion\r\nit is inadvisable except in well established cases to extend to fronds\r\ngeneric terms based on reproductive shoots. The designation _Zamites_\r\nhas long been used for fronds that are clearly not closely related to\r\nrecent species of _Zamia_, and were it not an old established genus\r\nthe significance of which is not likely to be misunderstood, it would\r\nbe wiser to substitute for it some name implying no affinity with\r\nany existing type. On the other hand the employment by some authors\r\nof such generic names as _Encephalartos_ and _Ceratozamia_ is not\r\nwarranted by the evidence furnished by the imperfect material. Prof.\r\nNewberry[1424] described as _Encephalartos_? _denticulatus_ a piece\r\nof a frond from Rhaetic beds in Honduras characterised by lanceolate\r\npinnae (30 × 6 mm.) gradually narrowed towards the acute apex and\r\nabruptly contracted at the base: the method of attachment of the pinnae\r\nappears to agree with that in the genus _Zamites_. In this case there\r\nis no valid reason for assuming a relationship with _Encephalartos_\r\nor with any recent type. An impression from Lower Cretaceous, Dakota,\r\nbeds in Kansas described as _Encephalartos cretaceus_ Knowlt. ex Lesq.\r\nms.[1425] consists of a piece of lamina, 9 × 4 cm., obovate-oblong and\r\nwith a cuneate base, a serrate margin and thick diverging veins: the\r\nspecimen is too incomplete to serve as a record of any Cycadean genus.\r\nThe generic name _Encephalartopsis_ was applied by Fontaine[1426]\r\nto some imperfect pinnae from the Potomac beds characterised by a\r\nlinear-elliptical lamina with a spinous margin and slightly diverging\r\nand occasionally anastomosing veins. The figured examples of the\r\ntype-species, _E. nervosa_, suggest pinnae like those of _Ctenis_; but\r\nin the absence of a rachis the method of attachment of the segments\r\ncannot be ascertained. Saporta[1427] named a specimen from the Miocene\r\nflora of Koumi, Greece, _Encephalartos Gorceixianus_ because of its\r\nresemblance in habit to some species of the recent genus; but the\r\ndesignation _Zamites_ would be more appropriate. Ettingshausen recorded\r\nan imperfect impression of a pinna from Tertiary rocks in Styria as\r\n_Ceratozamia Hofmanni_[1428] although it is by no means certain that\r\nthe fragment is even Cycadean. The genus _Taeniopteris_ was described\r\nin the second volume of this book as probably a Pteridophyte, though\r\nof uncertain systematic position: it has, however, been shown by\r\nMr Thomas[1429] that the Jurassic species _T. vittata_ was almost\r\ncertainly borne on a stem with reproductive organs constructed on the\r\nBennettitalean plan. Further research may enable us to fix the position\r\nof other species but as yet _T. vittata_ is the only representative of\r\nthe genus which there is good reason for assigning to the Bennettitales.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that Cycadean plants, using the term in a wide\r\nsense to include the Bennettitales as well as the Cycadales, bulked\r\nlargely in Upper Triassic, Rhaetic, Jurassic-Wealden floras; the\r\nBennettitales probably reached their maximum development as regards\r\nwealth of form and geographical range in the latter part of the\r\nJurassic period and in the earliest phase of the Cretaceous epoch. In\r\nTriassic floras Cycadean plants are represented almost solely by fronds\r\nbut the very close resemblance between Keuper species and forms that\r\nin Jurassic rocks are found in association with fertile shoots leaves\r\nlittle doubt as to the affinity of Keuper and Rhaetic species.\r\n\r\nThe evidence obtained from Permo-Carboniferous strata is much more\r\nmeagre, at least as regards Cycadean leaves: the occurrence of certain\r\nmorphological Cycadean features is revealed by petrified vegetative\r\norgans of Palaeozoic plants, and the Cycadean plan of organisation is\r\nconspicuous in many Carboniferous and Permian seeds. The discovery\r\nof frond-impressions identical in external characters with Mesozoic\r\ngenera may be accepted as a substantial indication that genera already\r\nexisted possessing foliage of the Cycadean type, though we have no\r\ncertain information with regard to the nature of the other organs of\r\nthe parent-plants. A few examples of Palaeozoic species are included\r\namong those selected in illustration of the different genera, namely\r\n_Plagiozamites Planchardi_, _Sphenozamites Rochei_, _Pterophyllum\r\nFayoli_, _P. Cambryi_: among other recorded instances of Palaeozoic\r\nspecies are _Pterophyllum Cottaeanum_ Gutb.[1430], a Permian type\r\nsimilar in habit to _Ctenis_ but without anastomosing veins, a\r\nfeature in which it resembles _Pseudoctenis_; the Carboniferous\r\nspecies _Pterophyllum inflexum_ Eich.[1431] from the Altai mountains,\r\ntransferred by Zeiller to _Dioonites_; _P. blechnoides_ Sand.[1432]\r\nfrom the Stephanian of Oppenau; _Pterophyllum Grand’Euryanum_[1433]\r\nfrom Upper Carboniferous beds in France, and _P. gonorrachis_\r\nGoepp.[1434] from Silesia. An examination of the type-specimens of the\r\nCarboniferous species _Cycadites gyrosus_ Goepp. and _C. taxodinus_\r\nGoepp.[1435] in the Breslau Museum led me to regard the material as too\r\nimperfect to determine.\r\n\r\nA conclusion that is forced upon us by a consideration of the\r\ngeological range of Cycadean fronds is that at the close of the\r\nWealden period, a period very closely linked in the character of\r\nthe vegetation with the preceding Jurassic floras, there appears\r\nto have been a relatively sudden decrease in the number of members\r\nof the Cycadophyta: the decline in the fortunes of Cycadean plants\r\nis coincident with the rise and remarkably rapid extension of the\r\nAngiosperms. From Middle and Upper Cretaceous and from Tertiary beds\r\nvery few Cycadean remains have been obtained and many of them are\r\nrepresented by fragmentary fossils that afford no definite evidence\r\nof affinity to recent genera. The antiquity of the Cycadales, that\r\nis the section represented by existing Cycads, cannot be determined;\r\nbut it would seem probable that if the Cycads apart from the\r\nBennettitales existed in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous floras they\r\noccupied a very subordinate position in comparison with the extinct\r\nBennettitales. There are no data pointing to any widespread occurrence\r\nof the Cycadales in the Northern Hemisphere in Tertiary times at all\r\ncomparable with the geographical range of Tertiary ancestors of the\r\nsolitary survivor of the Ginkgoales.\r\n\r\nThe following records of Tertiary Cycadean fronds illustrate\r\nthe paucity of the records. Reference has already been made to\r\n_Encephalartos Gorceixianus_ Sap. of Miocene age, a species that has\r\nno claim to be regarded as an example of the recent South African\r\ngenus. The specimen described by Saporta and Marion as ? _Zamites\r\npalaeocenicus_[1436] from the Eocene of Gelinden is too imperfect to\r\nserve as a trustworthy record. A more satisfactory species, similar in\r\nhabit to _Zamites gigas_, is that on which Saporta founded the species\r\n_Zamites epibius_[1437] from Lower Miocene beds at Bonnieux (Vaucluse),\r\nFrance. Another Tertiary species is mentioned by Krasser[1438] from\r\nPliocene strata in Brazil as _Zamia praecedens_ Krass. ex Ett.\r\n+MS.+ Ettingshausen has described a Tertiary species from New South\r\nWales, either Lower Miocene or Upper Eocene in age, as _Anomozamites\r\nMuelleri_[1439], characterised by truncate segments with simple veins\r\nand set obliquely to the rachis.\r\n\r\nWhile certain form-genera of fronds can only be referred to the\r\nCycadophyta, in other cases it is possible to assign fronds to a\r\nsection of this comprehensive group characterised by a particular type\r\nof fertile shoot and by certain well defined epidermal features.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the cuticular structure of various Cycadean fronds\r\nby Nathorst[1440] and especially by Mr Thomas[1441] has supplied a\r\nbasis of classification which affords the best criterion of affinity so\r\nfar available. The majority of fronds are placed in the Bennettitales\r\nwhile the three genera _Ctenis_, _Nilssonia_, and _Ctenopteris_ (or\r\n_Ptilozamites_[1442]) are placed in the Nilssoniales.\r\n\r\nI. =Bennettitales.= Epidermal cells characterised by sinuous walls and\r\ngenerally rectangular; the cuticle is thin; the stomata, confined to\r\nthe lower surface of the pinnae, tend to be arranged at right-angles\r\nto the veins and are on a level with the epidermis or very slightly\r\ndepressed; two large laterally placed subsidiary cells more or less\r\nsurround the guard-cells and these are provided with thickenings of a\r\ndefinite shape (figs. 594, 609).\r\n\r\nGenera: _Ptilophyllum_, _Zamites_, _Otozamites_, _Dictyozamites_,\r\n_Pterophyllum_ and _Anomozamites_, _Taeniopteris_, _Pseudocycas_.\r\n\r\nII. =Nilssoniales.= Epidermal cells with straight walls, not sinuous,\r\nirregular in form, rounded, hexagonal, or rectangular; the stomata are\r\nbelow the level of the epidermis; the cuticle may be thin or thick.\r\nThere is no regular arrangement of the stomata; the guard-cells are\r\nsurrounded by 6–8 subsidiary cells (fig. 625) which often form an\r\noverarching canopy; thickening lamellae like those on the guard-cells\r\nof the Bennettitales are seldom present.\r\n\r\nGenera: _Nilssonia_, _Ctenis_, _Ctenopteris_.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the representatives of the smaller group,\r\nthe Nilssoniales, in their cuticular features, are more akin than the\r\nBennettitales to modern Cycads. Until definite evidence is obtained as\r\nto the nature of the reproductive organs of _Nilssonia_, _Ctenis_, and\r\n_Ctenopteris_ it is impossible to say how closely these genera agree\r\nin essential characters with existing members of the Cycadales. If, as\r\nhas been suggested, the fertile shoots known as _Beania_[1444] belong\r\nto _Nilssonia_ their resemblance in plan of construction to the cones\r\nof recent genera, much greater than in the case of the flowers of the\r\nBennettitales, is in accordance with the evidence of the epidermal\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nReference was made in the second Volume of this book to several genera\r\nfounded on fronds which through lack of evidence as to the nature of\r\nthe reproductive organs cannot be assigned with certainty either to\r\nFerns or Cycads: it was stated that the genera _Ptilozamites_ and\r\n_Ctenopteris_ are probably Cycadean, and the structure of the epidermal\r\ncells in the latter genus lends support to this view[1445]. Among other\r\ngenera of doubtful position not included in the following descriptions\r\nof fronds is _Zamiopsis_ of Fontaine[1446] founded on large compound\r\nfronds from the Potomac formation: the venation and form of the pinnae\r\nare more Fern-like than in _Ctenopteris_, but in general habit the\r\ntwo genera are not very dissimilar. The generic name Zamiopsis is\r\nmisleading as the species bear no resemblance to _Zamia_ or _Zamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+I. Bennettitales.+\r\n\r\n=PTILOPHYLLUM.= Morris.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Ptilophyllum_ was instituted in 1840 for some\r\nspecimens of pinnate fronds from Cutch: in this genus Morris[1447]\r\nincluded with the Indian leaves the English Jurassic species\r\n_Pterophyllum pecten_ Lind. and Hutt.[1448] (figs. 587, etc.) and\r\nsome other forms. He defined _Ptilophyllum_ as follows: ‘Fronds\r\npinnate; pinnae closely approximated, linear, lanceolate, more or\r\nless elongate, imbricate at the base, attached obliquely; base\r\nsemicircular or rounded; veins equal, slender, parallel.’ Morris adds\r\nthat he instituted a new genus in preference to _Zamites_ because\r\nof the ‘oblique insertion of the pinnae and their overlapping each\r\nother at the base.’ In a later paper Morris[1449] states that the\r\npinnae of _Ptilophyllum_ fronds are ‘sometimes auriculed in the upper\r\nand sometimes in the lower part’ of the base of the lamina. In his\r\ncatalogue[1450] he adopted Endlicher’s genus _Palaeozamia_ instead of\r\n_Ptilophyllum_. Without discussing the generic nomenclature adopted\r\nby various authors for the Indian types and similar fronds it is\r\nimportant to refer briefly to the treatment of Morris’s species by\r\nOldham and Morris and by Feistmantel. In the first of the series of\r\nMemoirs on Gondwana floras[1451] _Ptilophyllum_ is retained for a\r\nsection of _Palaeozamia_ together with _Otozamites_ and _Sphenozamites_\r\nas other sectional subdivisions: in the subgenus _Ptilophyllum_ are\r\nincluded _Palaeozamia acutifolia_ and _P. cutchensis_ (fig. 588, A,\r\nC), also _P. affinis_, _P. rigida_, and _P. bengalensis_. The last\r\nspecies is in all probability an _Otozamites_: _P. affinis_ and _P.\r\nrigida_ are almost certainly indistinguishable from _P. cutchensis_.\r\nFeistmantel[1452] dealt in detail with the genus _Ptilophyllum_: he\r\nwrote, ‘with Schimper and Schenk I therefore look upon this genus\r\nas an Indian type especially characterised by its ... more or less\r\nslender leaves, angustate towards the apex and base, and petiolate,\r\nwith regularly adfixed leaflets.... The leaflets are equal to each\r\nother, for the most part elongate linear, and _auriculate and free\r\nat the upper angle at the base_, but adfixed at the lower angle, and\r\neach is decurrent behind the upper angle of the leaflet next below it,\r\nthus the leaflets are almost imbricate. The veins are rather numerous,\r\nsimple, and forked, and more or less divergent[1453].’ Feistmantel\r\ndistinguishes certain varieties of _P. cutchense_ (fig. 588, A, C),\r\nnone of which appear to be well defined. A specimen from the Rajmahal\r\nHills with unusually long pinnae, the frond having a breadth of 8 cm.,\r\nis described as _Ptilophyllum acutifolium_ var. _maximum_[1454], but\r\nit differs in no important feature from the smaller and commoner form.\r\nThe next point to be considered is the variability of certain species\r\nreferred by Feistmantel to _Otozamites_. He figures specimens from the\r\nJabalpur group as _O. Hislopi_ Feist. ex Old. +MS.+, _O. gracilis_\r\n(Kurr), _O. angustatus_ Feist. (fig. 588, B) and _O. distans_[1455]. An\r\nexamination of the figured specimens leads me to regard _O. Hislopi_\r\nand _O. gracilis_ as identical with the _Ptilophyllum_ fronds: the\r\npinnae exhibit no distinguishing features and there is no reason for\r\na specific, still less a generic, separation. _Otozamites angustatus_\r\nis indistinguishable from _Otozamites_ sp. as figured from the\r\nMadras coast and from _Ptilophyllum cutchense_, _P. cutchense_ var.\r\n_curvifolium_ and var. _minimum_. The drawings reproduced in fig. 6_a_,\r\nPl. +x.+ of the Madras flora[1456] and in fig. 8_a_, Pl. +vi.+ of the\r\nJabalpur flora[1457] showing auriculate bases are inaccurate: in all\r\nthe fronds named the pinnae are straight with rounded edges precisely\r\nas in _Ptilophyllum_. The conclusion forced upon me by a comparison\r\nof the actual specimens is that the Indian fronds are not separable\r\ninto well-defined species and should all be included in _Ptilophyllum\r\ncutchense_. Moreover in this comprehensive species should be included\r\nthe specimens described by Feistmantel as _Otozamites Hislopi_ (fig.\r\n589), _O. angustatus_, and _O. gracilis_. It may well be that a more\r\ndetailed investigation of the numerous forms comprised in this protean\r\nspecies, particularly if specimens are obtained from which cuticular\r\npreparations can be made, may lead to the recognition of additional\r\nspecies or well-defined varieties. The resemblance between the various\r\nforms of _P. pecten_ from the Jurassic strata of Yorkshire and those\r\nof _P. cutchense_ from India is very striking, and at least in many\r\ncases no specific separation is possible so far at least as the form of\r\nthe fronds and pinnae is concerned. The occasional close association\r\nof _Ptilophyllum_ fronds and _Williamsonia_ flowers is an important\r\nagreement between the English and Indian fronds (fig. 590).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 587. _Ptilophyllum pecten._ (British Museum, V.\r\n3795; ¼ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 588. _Ptilophyllum pecten._ A, C, specimens\r\nfigured by Feistmantel as _Ptilophyllum cutchense_.

A, ⅚ nat. size; B, enlarged\r\n(Calcutta Museum).]\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the Catalogue of Jurassic plants from Yorkshire\r\nthe opinion was expressed[1458], based on an examination of Morris’s\r\ntype-specimen of _Ptilophyllum cutchense_ and of a large number\r\nof English and other fronds identical with or closely allied to\r\n_Pterophyllum pecten_ Lind. and Hutt., that the Indian and European\r\nfronds belong to the same genus. In a later paper[1459] it was\r\nmaintained that _P. cutchense_ and _P. acutifolium_ are probably\r\nidentical with the English type, and a drawing was published—reproduced\r\nin fig. 591—of Morris’s type-specimen. Dr Halle[1460] has discussed\r\nthe genus _Ptilophyllum_ and his investigations lead him to a\r\ndifferent conclusion; he, like Zeiller and some other authors, employs\r\n_Ptilophyllum_ in Feistmantel’s sense. The pinna-base is said to agree\r\nin its asymmetrical form with that in _Otozamites_, while it differs\r\nfrom the symmetrical base of _Zamites_ pinnae. In _Ptilophyllum_ both\r\nedges of the pinna-base are said to bend down in joining the rachis; at\r\nthe upper corner the base thus becomes rounded and for some distance\r\nfree from the rachis; it is also sometimes a little auriculate; at the\r\nlower edge the pinna is decurrent on the upper surface of the rachis.\r\nIn a subsequent paper Halle[1461] repeats the view that the decurrence\r\nof the pinnae by their lower edges is an important distinguishing\r\nfeature of _Ptilophyllum_, thus agreeing with Feistmantel whose\r\nillustrations appear to be confirmatory. The drawings in Feistmantel’s\r\nmemoirs are, however, misleading and in some cases incorrect. An\r\nexamination of a photograph of Morris’s type-specimen of _P. cutchense_\r\nled Halle to conclude that the two edges of the pinna-base bend\r\ndownwards on joining the rachis as described by Feistmantel. This\r\nfeature is not shown in the drawing reproduced in fig. 591: it is\r\nclear that either the drawing is incorrect or that there has been some\r\nmistake in the interpretation of the photograph. Through the courtesy\r\nof Dr Halle I have been able to examine the actual print: when viewed\r\nin its correct position the two edges of the pinnae appear to bend\r\ndown as described by Halle, but if it is examined in the reverse\r\nposition the lower angle of the pinnae is seen to be slightly rounded\r\nas in fig. 591, the apparent decurrence being due to a confusion\r\nbetween the appressed lower edge of one pinna, which is faintly shown,\r\nand the stronger downward trend of the upper edge of the pinna next\r\nbelow. The upper edges of the pinnae are more prominent because they\r\nare less appressed to the rachis while the lower half of the base\r\nis closer to the rachis and is frequently, though not in Morris’s\r\nspecimen, overlapped by the upper edge of the next lower pinna. A\r\nre-examination of the type-specimen in the British Museum confirms this\r\ninterpretation. The pinnae of _Ptilophyllum_ are characterised by their\r\nattachment to the upper face of the rachis which they almost completely\r\ncover; the upper angle is rounded and in a few cases auriculate\r\n(fig. 592); the lower angle of the base is slightly rounded and not\r\ninfrequently hidden by the imbrication of the adjacent pinna; it is\r\noccasionally auriculate (fig. 593). The pinnae are attached by nearly\r\nthe whole base, but the upper angle is free. The veins are parallel,\r\nsub-parallel or, especially in the proximal portion of the lamina,\r\noblique. The pinnae are linear, varying considerably in relation of\r\nlength to breadth and in the form of the apex; they are straight or\r\nmore or less falcate. The epidermal cells of such _Ptilophyllum_\r\nfronds as have been examined are characterised by strongly looped or\r\nsinuous walls; the stomata, confined to the lower surface, are roughly\r\ncircular and the guard-cells are at right-angles to the veins and not\r\nappreciably sunk. Fig. 594 represents the appearance of a stoma in\r\nsurface-view: ‘on either side of the central slit-like pore are two\r\nelliptical or hemispherical structures; they are somewhat flattened\r\nwhen they abut on the pore, and have rounded ends.... Between these\r\nand the subsidiary cells lie two other thickened patches, more or\r\nless hemispherical in shape, and apparently overlying the central\r\nstructures.’ On the analogy of similar appearances in recent Cycads Mr\r\nThomas[1462] interprets the two pairs of thickened patches as belonging\r\nto the upper and lower sides of the highly inclined guard-cells. This\r\nauthor calls special attention to the abundance on some of the fronds\r\nincluded in the aggregate species _P. pecten_ of regular rows of\r\ncircular hair-scars preserved as small annulate projections, ·03–·04\r\nmm. in diameter. A comparison of the cuticles of different forms of\r\n_Ptilophyllum pecten_ enabled Thomas to recognise more than one type:\r\nfor one of these the name _Ptilophyllum hirsutum_ is proposed. It is\r\nby such work as this that we may hope to discover differentiating\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 590. _Ptilophyllum pecten_ (_P. cutchense_) and\r\n_Williamsonia Blanfordi_.

(After Thomas; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 594. _Ptilophyllum pecten_; stoma. (After Thomas\r\nand Bancroft.)]\r\n\r\nThe different forms of _Williamsonia_ flowers found in association\r\nwith fronds of the _Ptilophyllum_ habit also point to the inclusion\r\nof more than a single species under the group-species _P. pecten_. As\r\nadditional evidence is obtained further analysis will be possible,\r\nbut in dealing with impressions which include specimens transitional\r\nfrom one form of frond to another, the most convenient and to my\r\nmind the most logical course is to treat a species as an aggregate-\r\nor group-species. Some authors believe that the two fronds described\r\nby Phillips as _Cycadites pecten_ and _C. pectinoides_ are distinct\r\nspecies[1463], but there would seem to be no adequate reason for this\r\nview. The fronds described by Heer[1464] from the Lower Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland as species of _Zamites_ and similar leaves from Graham Land\r\nincluded in that genus by Halle[1465] are in my opinion inseparable\r\nfrom _Ptilophyllum_, and this applies equally to _Otozamites Hislopi_\r\n(Old.) (fig. 589) and _O. abbreviatus_ as figured by Feistmantel\r\nand by Halle. The nomenclature of Cycadean fronds having the habit\r\nof _Ptilophyllum pecten_ is a great difficulty: after carefully\r\nreconsidering the whole question and comparing Feistmantel’s figured\r\nspecimens with the large series of English fronds the conclusion\r\nreached is that the characters exhibited by ordinary impressions do not\r\nadmit of any satisfactory grouping under well-defined specific types.\r\nIn the first place, as already indicated, the use by some authors of\r\nthe generic names _Ptilophyllum_, _Otozamites_, and _Zamites_ creates\r\na false impression of the degree of difference between the numerous\r\nforms of frond agreeing more or less closely with the specimens\r\non which were founded the species _Ptilophyllum acutifolium_, _P.\r\ncutchense_, _P. pecten_, and _P. pectinoides_ (figs. 587, 591, 595,\r\netc.). In his important memoir on the Jurassic flora of Graham Land\r\nHalle[1466] discusses the limitation of _Ptilophyllum_, _Zamites_,\r\nand _Otozamites_. He employs _Zamites_ for fronds with linear pinnae\r\nattached to the upper face of the rachis by a base which is more\r\nor less, but often very little, rounded and always asymmetrical,\r\nwith or without a basal callosity: fronds of the type _Z. gigas_ he\r\nincludes in the section _Euzamites_, while _Z. borealis_ and similar\r\nforms (fig. 597) are referred to a second section, _Subzamites_. It\r\nis in the sense of Halle’s section _Euzamites_ that the generic name\r\n_Zamites_ is employed in this chapter. On the other hand the fronds\r\ngrouped by Halle as _Subzamites_ have pinnae with the basal angles of\r\nthe lamina very slightly rounded precisely as in _Ptilophyllum_ as\r\nseen in fig. 596 (_cf._ fig. 598 which represents fronds referred by\r\nHalle to _Zamites_); and they are not distinguished by any feature of\r\ngeneric importance from _Ptilophyllum_ as defined on page 519. The\r\nspecies _Zamites pusillus_, _Z. Anderssoni_, and _Z. antarcticus_ (fig.\r\n598) described by Halle from Graham Land as well as Heer’s Arctic\r\nforms[1467] _Z. borealis_ (fig. 597), _Z. speciosus_, _Z. brevipennis_,\r\nand others are transferred to _Ptilophyllum_ as types agreeing very\r\nclosely with _P. pecten_ and in some cases not clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom it even specifically.\r\n\r\n_Otozamites_ is the name employed by Halle for fronds with pinnae\r\nhaving contracted, asymmetrical and auriculate, bases, the anterior\r\nlobe being more developed than the posterior. The asymmetry of the\r\npinna-base is considered an essential feature. As Halle states it\r\nis very difficult in some instances to draw a distinction between\r\n_Otozamites_ and _Ptilophyllum_. As used in this chapter _Otozamites_\r\nsignifies fronds with pinnae characterised by an auriculate base, a\r\nlamina usually broader than in _Ptilophyllum_, and by more spreading\r\nveins (fig. 604). The not infrequent occurrence of auriculate pinnae on\r\nfronds (fig. 603, A) which cannot be separated from typical examples of\r\n_P. pecten_ illustrates the narrow dividing line as regards the form\r\nof the pinna-base between _Ptilophyllum_ and _Otozamites_. The Indian\r\nspecies _O. Hislopi_ (fig. 589) and _O. abbreviatus_, to which Halle\r\nrefers some Antarctic fronds, cannot be distinguished from the English\r\n_P. pecten_ or Feistmantel’s and Morris’s Indian fronds described as\r\n_P. cutchense_ and _P. acutifolium_: these forms are therefore included\r\nin _Ptilophyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyllum_ (_Williamsonia_) _pecten_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nThis designation is employed in a wide sense for a group of fronds\r\nexhibiting a considerable range in size, in the relative breadth and\r\nlength of the linear pinnae, and in other features. Under _P. pecten_\r\nare included (i) the English fronds from Yorkshire first described\r\nby Phillips[1468] as _Cycadites pecten_ and _C. pectinoides_, the\r\nformer from the Middle shale, the latter from the Lower shale of the\r\nYorkshire coast, together with the Stonesfield slate specimens named\r\nby Sternberg[1469] _Polypodiolites pectiniformis_ (fig. 595) and by\r\nBrongniart[1470] and Lindley and Hutton[1471] _Zamia pectinata_; (ii)\r\nthe Indian specimens already considered and (iii) numerous examples\r\nrecorded under different names from Jurassic strata in many countries.\r\nFronds from the Yorkshire coast named by Brongniart[1472] _Zamia\r\nGoldiei_, though regarded by some authors as examples of _Otozamites_,\r\nare probably referable to _P. pecten_. Andrae’s _Pterophyllum\r\nrigidum_[1473] (fig. 596) from Steierdorf is almost certainly a form\r\nof _Ptilophyllum pecten_. The specimen shown in fig. 587 is one of the\r\nfew examples of fronds apparently preserved in their original position\r\nattached in a cluster to a _Williamsonia_ (_Bucklandia_) type of stem.\r\nThe range in size and form of the pinnae is illustrated in figs. 588,\r\n592, 593.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 595. _Ptilophyllum pecten._ The specimen figured\r\nby Sternberg as _Polypodiolites pectiniformis_. (Oxford Museum; ⅚ nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 596. _Ptilophyllum pecten._ Andrae’s\r\n_Pterophyllum rigidum_ from Steierdorf, Banat. (British Museum, No.\r\n41438; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nFronds linear, tapering gradually towards the base and apex, often\r\ncharacterised by a marked uniformity in breadth. The pinnae, short or\r\ncomparatively broad or long and narrow, are straight or more or less\r\nfalcate; the apex is obtuse or acute or the upper margin of the lamina\r\nmay be almost straight and the lower edge curved abruptly upwards\r\nat the apex; the pinnae are usually attached obliquely to the rachis\r\nbut may be almost at right-angles; with the exception of the upper\r\nangle, the whole of the base is attached to the frond-axis; the base\r\nof the lamina may be symmetrical, both angles being slightly rounded,\r\nor asymmetrical, the upper or less frequently the lower corner being\r\nauriculate (figs. 592, 593). There is no basal callosity on the lamina\r\nnor is there a median sinus. The veins are more or less spreading at\r\nthe base but for the most part parallel. The features of the epidermal\r\ncells and stomata are mentioned in the general account of the genus.\r\nFertile shoots of plants with this type of frond are described\r\nunder _Williamsonia_. Very little is known of the stems which bore\r\n_Ptilophyllum_ fronds, but as stated on page 488 Indian specimens show\r\nleaves of _Ptilophyllum cutchense_ attached to a piece of stem (fig.\r\n579) having the characters of _Bucklandia_ and characterised by a\r\nxylem-cylinder denser than in recent Cycads; the structure of the wood\r\nat least in the Indian stem is rather pycnoxylic than manoxylic.\r\n\r\nThe fronds grouped under _Ptilophyllum pecten_ are very widely\r\ndistributed in Jurassic floras; they are recorded from many\r\nlocalities in Europe, from Turkestan[1474], India, Graham Land[1475],\r\nPatagonia[1476], and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs thus defined this ‘species,’ or more correctly this group of forms,\r\nundoubtedly includes more than one species in the strict sense, but\r\nwithout additional data it is maintained that the recognition of\r\nclearly defined specific types or varieties is beyond our power.\r\nIt may be urged that in view of the wide geographical range of the\r\n_Ptilophyllum pecten_ type of frond and the admitted probability that\r\nseveral species in the narrower sense are represented, distinctive\r\nspecific names should be retained even though under such designations\r\nare included forms that, so far as can be seen from impressions,\r\nexhibit no constant distinguishing features. My purpose is to emphasise\r\nthe futility of attempting to found well-marked species on the\r\navailable material. The student must decide for himself what course\r\nto pursue, whether to retain such a specific name as _cutchense_ for\r\nthe Indian fronds or to employ that and other specific names as\r\ndesignations of geographical types differing in no clearly defined\r\nor constant characters from examples of the English _Ptilophyllum\r\npecten_. A comparative examination of the cuticular membranes in the\r\ncomparatively few cases where that is possible would probably furnish a\r\nbasis for a satisfactory subdivision of the group-species.\r\n\r\nThe names _Ptilophyllum Anderssoni_, _P. boreale_, and _P. antarcticum_\r\nare retained for certain forms selected from a number of closely allied\r\ntypes partly on the ground that these fronds exhibit some more or less\r\nwell-marked distinctive characters and in part as a recognition of the\r\nexistence of geographical forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyllum boreale_ (Heer).\r\n\r\nHeer[1477] described numerous well-preserved impressions of pinnate\r\nfronds from the Lower Cretaceous plant-beds of Kome, Greenland, which\r\nhe referred to several species of _Zamites_ though the differences\r\nbetween them are hardly of specific rank. An inspection of several\r\nof the figured specimens in the Stockholm Museum showed that Heer’s\r\ndrawings are in the main accurate. _Zamites borealis_ (fig. 597) is\r\ncharacterised by small linear pinnae attached to the upper face of\r\nthe rachis, the stoutness of which is a noteworthy feature; the veins\r\nare parallel and simple. In the shape of the pinnae, including the\r\nbase-characters, this species agrees closely with _P. pecten_. The\r\nslightly falcate or straight pinnae are 1·7–2 mm. broad and reach\r\na length of 15 mm.; in _Z. speciosum_ Heer, probably specifically\r\nidentical with _P. boreale_, the pinnae are relatively longer, and in\r\n_Z. brevipennis_ Heer they resemble the shorter pinnae of some of the\r\nnarrow fronds of _P. pecten_.\r\n\r\nA preparation of the cuticle of a pinna of _P. boreale_ made by\r\nMr Thomas from a specimen in the Stockholm Museum shows a marked\r\ndifference between the upper and lower epidermis: the cells on the\r\nupper surface of the lamina have very thick and sinuous walls precisely\r\nas in _P. pecten_, but the cells are often broader than long and not\r\nelongated parallel to the long axis of the pinna; those of the lower\r\nepidermis are thinner and less clearly preserved: the stomata, which\r\nappear to be like those of _P. pecten_, are scattered and not in rows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 597. _Ptilophyllum boreale_ (Heer). Drawn from\r\none of the specimens from the Lower Cretaceous beds at Ekkorfat,\r\nGreenland, figured by Heer. (Stockholm Museum; nat. size and a few\r\npinnae enlarged.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyllum antarcticum_ (Halle).\r\n\r\nThe fronds from the Jurassic rocks of Graham Land, described by Halle\r\nas _Zamites antarcticus_[1478], are very similar to some forms of _P.\r\npecten_ and to _P. boreale_ and other Greenland forms; the linear\r\nsubacute pinnae are attached to the upper face of the rachis at a wide\r\nangle and the base of the lamina is truncate and may be very slightly\r\nconstricted. The veins are dense, as many as 5 in 1 mm., and they are\r\noccasionally forked near the base (fig. 598, A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 598. A, A′, _Ptilophyllum antarcticum_. B, _P.\r\nAnderssoni_. (After Halle.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyllum Anderssoni_ (Halle).\r\n\r\nThis Graham Land species (fig. 598, B), referred by Halle to\r\n_Zamites_[1479], is of the same general type as _P. pecten_, but\r\nis characterised by a coarser venation and by the wider angle of\r\nattachment of the pinnae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyllum Dunkerianum_ (Goeppert).\r\n\r\nGoeppert[1480] proposed the name _Pterophyllum Dunkerianum_ for some\r\nspecimens from the Wealden of North Germany which were afterwards\r\nfigured by Dunker[1481]. Miquel[1482] included the species in his genus\r\n_Dioonites_ and this name has been adopted by other authors. Attention\r\nhas been drawn to the inconsistent use of the title _Dioonites_[1483],\r\nand I have previously employed the name in a sense similar to that in\r\nwhich it has been adopted by Nathorst, that is for fronds with long\r\nand narrow pinnae without any basal constriction and not auriculate,\r\nattached more or less at right-angles to the upper face of the\r\nrachis; but so defined _Dioonites_ differs in no essential particular\r\nfrom forms of _Ptilophyllum_ or from fronds referred by authors\r\nto Schimper’s genus _Ctenophyllum_. The name _Ctenophyllum_[1484]\r\nwas instituted for certain fronds differing in some points from\r\n_Otozamites_ and _Dioonites_. One such type is _Ctenophyllum_\r\n(_Ptilophyllum_) _pecten_ (Lind. and Hutt.): this is quoted in Zittel’s\r\n_Handbuch_ as a typical representative of the genus. Schimper followed\r\nFeistmantel in his definition of _Ptilophyllum_, a definition which\r\nis not in accordance with the characters of the fronds on which it\r\nwas founded by Morris. Fontaine, on the other hand, has applied\r\n_Ctenophyllum_ to fronds of a different type which are now included in\r\nthe genus _Pseudoctenis_. There would seem to be no adequate ground for\r\nthe retention of _Ctenophyllum_ as a generic designation.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden species _P. Dunkerianum_ is characterised by the following\r\nfeatures: rachis fairly stout, pinnae approximate, linear 2–3 mm. broad\r\nand reaching a length of 11 cm. or more, gradually narrowed towards the\r\napex, attached in two almost contiguous rows to the upper face of the\r\nfrond-axis: the lower margin of the lamina may be slightly decurrent,\r\n_e.g._ in the apical part of the frond or very slightly broadened and\r\nbluntly rounded. The pinnae are attached at right-angles or, near the\r\napex, obliquely; veins 5–6, parallel. The epidermal cells as figured\r\nby Schenk[1485] have very sinuous walls and are identical with those\r\nof the English and Indian forms of the group-species _P. pecten_; the\r\nstomata are confined to the lower surface. If Schenk’s drawings of the\r\nstomata are correct they differ from those of other species of the\r\ngenus in their simpler structure; there are no subsidiary cells and\r\nthe guard-cells show no cuticularised bands. In habit this species\r\nresembles _Encephalartos Ghellinckii_ Lehm. (fig. 382). The superficial\r\nresemblance of the narrow linear pinnae to those of _Cycadites_ led\r\nDunker and Schenk to refer to that genus some specimens which have\r\nsince been described as identical with _P. Dunkerianum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ZAMITES.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the generic name _Zamites_ was used in addition\r\nto _Zamia_ for certain pinnate fronds including species[1486],\r\nsuch as _Z. Bechei_, which are now regarded as typical examples of\r\n_Otozamites_. Subsequently Brongniart gave up _Zamia_ for fossil fronds\r\nand applied _Zamites_ to fronds with entire pinnae, not truncate at the\r\napex and not decurrent but slightly constricted at the base. Braun’s\r\ntwo genera _Podozamites_ and _Pterozamites_ were relegated to the\r\nposition of subgenera. The name _Podozamites_ has been employed by\r\nSchenk[1487] for specimens now included in _Zamites_, and _Zamites_ is\r\nused by him[1488] for some fossils which are examples of _Podozamites_\r\nas generally understood. Goeppert’s definition[1489] of _Zamites_\r\nincludes fronds with pinnae of the _Otozamites_ type, and this author\r\npertinently compares _Zamites_ with recent _Encephalartos_ leaves.\r\nPomel[1490] proposed the name _Crossozamia_ for certain fronds of the\r\n_Zamites_ type, but this genus with several others instituted by the\r\nsame author has not been adopted. Bornemann[1491] described _Zamites_\r\nas comprising species with a greater or less resemblance to the fronds\r\nof recent Zamias.\r\n\r\nAs defined below, _Zamites_ fronds may be compared with those of\r\nsome species of _Encephalartos_, _Ceratozamia_, and _Macrozamia_.\r\nThere has been considerable difference of opinion with regard to\r\nthe range of form in the pinnae that it is advisable to include in\r\n_Zamites_. The name _Zamiophyllum_ was proposed by Nathorst[1492]\r\nfor a Wealden species, described by Ettingshausen as _Pterophyllum\r\nBuchianum_ (fig. 601, A–C), characterised by a decrease in the breadth\r\nof the linear pinnae towards the point of attachment and, according\r\nto Nathorst’s description, by the lateral attachment of the pinnae.\r\nAn examination of specimens of this type from English rocks[1493]\r\nenabled me to show that the pinnae are attached to the upper face\r\nof the rachis. Zeiller[1494] has also included _Zamiophyllum_ in\r\n_Zamites_, but Halle’s recent definition[1495] of the latter genus\r\nexcludes fronds of the _Zamiophyllum_ type. Schimper instituted the\r\nname _Glossozamites_[1496] for fronds bearing pinnae with rounded and\r\nslightly contracted bases and borne on grooves on the upper surface\r\nof the rachis (fig. 601, F). In venation the pinnae agree with those\r\nof _Otozamites_ but the base is not auriculate. Kurr’s Liassic\r\nspecies _Pterophyllum oblongifolium_[1497] included by Schimper in\r\n_Glossozamites_ is probably an _Otozamites_. Another species referred\r\nto this genus is Schenk’s _Podozamites Zitteli_[1498] from the Urgonian\r\nof Austria (fig. 601, F): in this species the slightly falcate pinnae\r\nwith obtuse apices have rounded and not auriculate bases and there is\r\nsome evidence of a basal callosity. This species agrees so closely\r\nwith such a typical _Zamites_ as _Z. gigas_ that it is difficult to\r\nsee on what grounds the retention of _Glossozamites_ is desirable.\r\nA Portuguese specimen referred by Saporta[1499] to _Glossozamites_,\r\n_G. brevis_, is founded on a single specimen very like a leaflet of\r\n_Otozamites Klipsteinii_ (Dunk.); and _G. parvifolia_ Yok.[1500] from\r\nChina has no claim to be included among Cycadean fronds. Feistmantel’s\r\n_Glossozamites Stoliczkanus_[1501] is almost certainly a leaf of\r\n_Cordaites_. For certain fronds originally described as _Zamites_\r\nZeiller[1502] has instituted the genus _Plagiozamites_. An important\r\nquestion as to the type of frond which may conveniently be included\r\nin the genus _Zamites_ was raised by the application of this name by\r\nHeer to some Lower Cretaceous fronds from Greenland, _Z. borealis_ (=\r\n_Ptilophyllum boreale_, fig. 597), and others which differ in the form\r\nof the pinnae from species usually regarded as typical of the genus.\r\nHalle[1503] accepts the Greenland species as examples of _Zamites_\r\nthough he distinguishes them by a sectional name _Sub-Zamites_; he\r\ndefines _Zamites_ as including fronds with pinnae attached to the\r\nupper face of the rachis with a contracted and always symmetrical base\r\nthough in some cases the basal contraction is exceedingly small; there\r\nis a more or less distinct basal callosity. He recognises two types,\r\n(i) _Eu-Zamites_, _e.g._ _Zamites gigas_ (fig. 599), in which the\r\npinnae are strongly contracted basally and have a callosity, and (ii)\r\n_Sub-Zamites_, _e.g._ _Z. borealis_[1504], etc., in which the pinnae\r\nare not so broadly rounded at the base and retain the same breadth to\r\nthe point of insertion where they are ‘very rapidly and very little\r\ncontracted,’ with or without a basal callosity. The basal callosity\r\nin these forms is not shown in many of the pinnae and is at most but\r\na slight rounding of the angles of the truncate base. The specimens\r\nreferred by Halle to _Sub-Zamites_ do not appear to differ in any\r\nfeature worthy of generic rank from _Ptilophyllum_.\r\n\r\nIn the following definition _Zamites_ is employed in a sense more or\r\nless in accordance with Brongniart’s usage but with the inclusion of\r\nsuch forms as _Z. Buchianus_, the type of Nathorst’s _Zamiophyllum_,\r\nand the exclusion of Heer’s Arctic and Halle’s Antarctic fronds\r\nreferred by them to _Zamites_.\r\n\r\nFronds broadly lanceolate reaching a length of over 60 cm.; pinnae\r\nmore or less oblique or at right-angles to the rachis (fig. 599),\r\nattached to the upper surface but not completely covering it, linear\r\nor linear-lanceolate, acuminate or obtuse, usually abruptly contracted\r\nat the rounded base and more rarely _(e.g._ _Z. Buchianus_, fig. 601)\r\ngradually tapering to the proximal end, with or without a callosity\r\nat the symmetrical base; veins divergent at the base, simple or\r\ndichotomously branched, for the most part parallel to the edges of the\r\nlamina and slightly divergent in the apical region. The presence of a\r\nbasal callosity, such as is best seen in the pinnae of recent species\r\nof _Macrozamia_, is not a feature of great importance and cannot be\r\neasily recognised in many impressions. In the process of fossilisation\r\nthe pinnae are often flattened against the surface of the rachis and\r\nthis may produce transverse wrinklings of the lamina suggestive of a\r\nbasal thickening. In some cases stems of the _Bucklandia_ type occur\r\nin connexion with _Zamites_ fronds (fig. 541). An account of these\r\nstems, and of inflorescences of _Williamsonia_ which were borne by\r\nsome at least of the plants with _Zamites_ leaves is given in Chapter\r\n+xxviii.+ In such examples of _Zamites_ as have been examined the\r\nepidermal cells have sinuous walls and the stomata[1505], confined to\r\nthe lower face of the lamina, occur in rows with their long axis at\r\nright-angles to that of the pinnae.\r\n\r\n_Zamites_ ranges from Rhaetic to Lower Cretaceous strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zamites truncatus_ Zeiller.\r\n\r\nA Rhaetic species from Tonkin[1506] characterised by oval linear pinnae\r\ngiven off at a wide angle, alternate and not contiguous; apex obtusely\r\ntruncate, gradually narrowed to a cuneate base which is rounded or\r\nelliptical and has a more or less definite callosity. The pinnae vary\r\nfrom 3 to 5 cm. in length and from 5 to 13 mm. in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zamites gigas_ (Lindley and Hutton).\r\n\r\nThe specific name _gigas_ is retained in preference to that of\r\n_Mantelli_ employed by Brongniart[1507] on the ground that he\r\nafterwards discarded it in favour of the designation proposed by\r\nLindley and Hutton[1508], and because their name has been generally\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nFronds large, exceeding 60 cm.; broadly linear lanceolate; the\r\ncomparatively slender rachis bears alternate linear lanceolate pinnae\r\nwith a rounded and usually slightly swollen base and an acuminate apex.\r\nAt the apex of the frond the pinnae are narrow and linear (fig. 599)\r\nand almost parallel to the rachis; in the lower part they are shorter\r\nand relatively broader and attached approximately at right-angles. The\r\nnumerous veins diverge from the centre of the base but for the most\r\npart are parallel to the edge of the lamina. The form of the epidermal\r\ncells and the structure of the stomata have recently been described by\r\nMr Thomas. The external features of the stem (fig. 541) are described\r\nunder the genus _Williamsonia_. In the case of fronds of this type\r\nfrom English Jurassic rocks it would be legitimate to speak of them as\r\n_Williamsonia gigas_, but in view of the fact that such fronds usually\r\noccur as detached specimens and without any associated flowers it is\r\nadvisable, as Nathorst maintains, to retain the non-committal genus\r\n_Zamites_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 599. _Zamites gigas_. (British Museum, V.\r\n2723_a_; ½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThis type of frond is widely distributed in Jurassic strata. The\r\noccurrence of many forms agreeing generally with the type-specimen\r\nbut differing from it in features that are not constant or of real\r\nmorphological importance renders accurate specific delimitation very\r\ndifficult. Species that appear to be indistinguishable from _Zamites\r\ngigas_ by any well-marked characters are, _Zamites Feneonis_[1509]\r\nBrongn., _Z. Moreaui_[1510] Brongn., _Z. Renevieri_[1511] Heer, and\r\n_Z. claravallensis_[1512] Sap.; similarly _Z. Schmiedelii_ And.[1513]\r\nis probably identical with _Z. gigas_. The Lower Cretaceous species\r\n_Zamites bohemicus_[1514] Vel. and _Z. iburgensis_[1515] Hos. and von\r\nd. Marck represent very similar forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zamites recta_ (Tate).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 600. _Zamites recta_. (Uitenhage series, S.\r\nAfrica.)]\r\n\r\nThis species was originally described by Tate[1516] as _Palaeozamia_\r\n(_Otozamites_) _recta_ from Wealden strata in South Africa and\r\nsubsequently transferred to _Zamites_[1517]; it bears a very close\r\nresemblance to _Z. gigas_. The fronds bear alternate linear pinnae\r\nattached to the upper face of the rachis by a slightly contracted\r\nand swollen base. The lamina has an acuminate asymmetrical apex and\r\nthe upper edge is slightly falcate; the larger pinnae are over 6\r\ncm. long and nearly 1 cm. broad; the veins are frequently forked as\r\nthey converge towards the base of the lamina. No clear evidence of\r\nassociation of these fronds in the Uitenhage series of South Africa\r\nwith _Williamsonia_ flowers has been discovered, but a specimen[1518]\r\nin the Tate collection in the British Museum may be a badly preserved\r\ncluster of bracts belonging to a _Williamsonia_. The rachis of this\r\nspecies shows some peculiar features in the form of two rows of\r\nalternate cushions in some partially decayed specimens. One of these is\r\nshown in fig. 600; the cushions are raised oval projections with a flat\r\ntop, and pieces of the rachis without pinnae might easily be mistaken\r\nfor a Coniferous stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zamites Carruthersi_ Seward.\r\n\r\nA species founded on specimens from the Wealden of Sussex[1519] and\r\nrecorded from Kimmeridge beds in Scotland[1520], characterised by\r\nlinear or linear-elliptical pinnae attached obliquely to the outer\r\npart of the upper surface of the rachis, somewhat abruptly narrowed\r\nat the proximal end but slightly broadened at the actual base (fig.\r\n601, D, E). The pinnae appear to have been caducous and, as in fig.\r\n601, D, the position of an absciss-layer is occasionally visible. In\r\nhabit the fronds bear a close resemblance to those of _Encephalartos\r\nlongifolius_ Lehm. The veins diverge from the base and are for the most\r\npart parallel, though divergent at the bluntly rounded apex. If, as\r\nmay be the case, a specimen figured by Hugh Miller[1521] from Scotland\r\nas _Zamites_ and subsequently named by Richards[1522] _Podozamites\r\nMilleri_ is identical with _Z. Carruthersi_, the specific name\r\n_Milleri_ has priority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 601. A–C, _Zamites Buchianus_. D, E, _Zamites\r\nCarruthersi_. F, _Zamites Zitteli_.

The rachis has a fairly broad median groove on the upper\r\nsurface; pinnae alternate, opposite or sub-opposite, from 3 to 20 cm.\r\nlong and from 1·5 to 2 cm. broad, linear, generally narrowed towards\r\nthe base, but in the more slender segments the reduction in breadth\r\nis less obvious; attached obliquely to the rachis, slightly thickened\r\nand broadened at the base (fig. 601, C), separated from the rachis\r\nby a distinct absciss-layer and leaving an elliptical scar; usually\r\ninclined at about 45° but the angle varies considerably in different\r\nparts of a frond (fig. 602); apices generally tapering to a point, or\r\nmore or less obtusely rounded; veins numerous, parallel, and not as\r\na rule prominent. It is by no means unlikely that specimens figured\r\nby Goeppert[1524] and some other authors as _Pterophyllum saxonicum_\r\nor _Dioonites saxonicus_ are examples of this species. Fontaine[1525]\r\nspeaks of _Dioonites Buchianus_ as one of the most widely distributed\r\nand characteristic members of the Potomac flora and it is described\r\nfrom Japan by Yokoyama[1526] and Nathorst[1527]. This type appears to\r\nbe especially characteristic of Wealden strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n=OTOZAMITES.= Braun.\r\n\r\nBraun[1528] proposed the name _Otozamites_ for certain Mesozoic fronds\r\nformerly included in _Zamites_, one of his types being _Otozamites\r\nobtusus_ (Lind. and Hutt.) (fig. 603, B) originally regarded by\r\nBrongniart as a Fern and named _Filicites Bucklandi_[1529]. The\r\nauriculate form of the base of the pinnae and the spreading veins were\r\nemphasised in the definition of the genus. As in the case of many other\r\nCycadean fronds the limits of the genus are not always easy to define,\r\nbut as described below the genus is on the whole fairly distinctive.\r\nIt is a very widely spread Jurassic type and extends from Triassic to\r\nLower Cretaceous rocks. The supposed Cretaceous species from Greenland,\r\n_O. groenlandica_ Heer[1530], is probably not a plant-impression but a\r\npolished groove in the rock.\r\n\r\nFronds pinnate, reaching a length of 50 cm. or more in some species;\r\npinnae alternate, separate or contiguous and imbricate, attached by\r\na portion of the base to the upper surface of the rachis, long and\r\nnarrow (fig. 603, A), broadly oval or almost orbicular, apex acute\r\nor obtuse, base auriculate and asymmetrical[1531], the anterior lobe\r\nbeing more prominent than the posterior edge of the lamina which is\r\nusually rounded. The veins radiate from the base and pass obliquely\r\nwith occasional branching to the edge of the pinna; in the more\r\nlinear pinnae the veins may be parallel or nearly so. Zigno[1532]\r\nfigured a piece of an _Otozamites_ frond from Jurassic Italian strata\r\nin connexion with a _Williamsonia_ and the actual specimen in the\r\nPadua Museum amply justifies the impression produced by the published\r\ndrawing. Wieland’s investigations[1533] in Mexico have brought to light\r\nmany cases of association of _Otozamites_ fronds and _Williamsonia_\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 603. A, _Otozamites Goeppertianus_. B,\r\n_Otozamites obtusus_ (= _O. Bechei_); type-specimen. (A, British\r\nMuseum, V. 2360; B, Oxford Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the epidermis is partially described by Schenk[1534]\r\nand more fully by Thomas[1535]: the epidermal cells have sinuous\r\nwalls and the stomata, apparently confined to the lower surface,\r\nhave guard-cells with hemispherical or spindle-shaped thickened\r\npatches like those of some _Zamites_ fronds. In one species, _O.\r\nFeistmanteli_ Zig., Thomas found about 100 stomata in 1 sq. mm. of\r\nlamina forming almost contiguous lines between the veins. In the\r\naccount of the genus _Ptilophyllum_ reference is made to the occurrence\r\nof pinnae with asymmetrical and auriculate bases, and it is only by\r\nthe comparison of a large number of specimens that a distinction can\r\nbe drawn between fronds that should be assigned to _Otozamites_ and\r\nforms of _Ptilophyllum_ which exhibit a well-marked tendency towards\r\nthe _Otozamites_ type of pinna (_cf._ figs. 592, 593). The variation\r\nin the form of the apices of pinnae and the relative position of the\r\npinnae in different parts of the same frond are features worthy of\r\nnotice in the determination of species[1536]. The different appearance\r\npresented by an _Otozamites_ frond as viewed from the upper and lower\r\nface is illustrated in fig. 604. There are no recent Cycads in which\r\nthe segments have auriculate bases, but in this feature as in the\r\nsinuous epidermal walls _Otozamites_ agrees with some species of the\r\nFern _Aneimia_, _e.g._ _A. rotundifolia_ Schrad. (fig. 223, Vol. +ii.+\r\np. 288).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 604. _Otozamites Bechei._ A specimen in the Bristol\r\nMuseum seen from below (A) and above (B). M. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites Bechei_ Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable confusion in the nomenclature of this species\r\ndescribed by Brongniart[1537] from Jurassic strata as _Filicites_\r\n_Bechei_: in it Brongniart included a specimen from the Lias of\r\nAxminster (Dorsetshire) previously figured by De la Beche as a fossil\r\nFern. It was on the Axminster specimen that Lindley and Hutton founded\r\nthe species _Otopteris obtusa_[1538], and as there is no doubt as to\r\nthe specific identity of their type-specimen (fig. 603, B) and De\r\nla Beche’s fossil, Brongniart’s designation has prior claim[1539].\r\n_Otozamites Bechei_ is, perhaps, best regarded as a comprehensive type\r\nor a group-species in which numerous _Otozamites_ fronds described\r\nby authors, on inadequate grounds, as distinct species may well be\r\nincluded. Fronds agreeing generally with _O. Bechei_ were very widely\r\nspread in Rhaetic and Jurassic floras.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from the Middle Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire have been\r\ndescribed as _Otozamites obtusus_ var. _ooliticus_[1540] to denote\r\na slight difference in the form of the pinnae from the Liassic\r\nfronds from Dorsetshire; but the distinctive features of the variety\r\n_ooliticus_ are unimportant and hardly worthy of consideration in a\r\ngeneral account of the species interpreted in a wide sense.\r\n\r\nFronds pinnate; pinnae usually more or less falcate, occasionally\r\nstraight and with parallel sides, attached obliquely to the upper side\r\nof the rachis; imbricate or separate, the upper edge of the base of the\r\nlamina strongly auriculate, the lower edge rounded; apex obtuse; veins\r\nstrongly divergent especially in the lobed base and extending obliquely\r\nto the upper and lower edge of the lamina.\r\n\r\nThe specimen, from the Lias of Lyme Regis, drawn in outline in fig.\r\n605, is an almost perfect frond: the pinnae are obtusely pointed,\r\nslightly falcate, and there is a prominent lobe on the upper edge of\r\nthe base of the laminae.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic species _Otozamites graphicus_[1541] (Leck. ex Bean\r\n+MS.+), _O. vicetinus_ Zig.[1542], _O. Hennocquei_[1543] (Pom.),\r\n_O. recurrens_ Sap., _O. Terquemi_[1544] Sap., _O. linearis_[1545]\r\nHalle, are some of many examples of fronds agreeing closely with\r\n_O. Bechei_, or in the case of _O. Terquemi_ with _O. graphicus_.\r\nThe fronds described by Halle from Graham Land as _O. linearis_\r\nafford a good illustration of the range of variation in the pinnae: a\r\ncharacteristic feature is the considerable length, exceeding 20 cm., of\r\nthe narrow linear fronds. The impressions from the Kome (Cretaceous)\r\nbeds of Greenland described by Heer as _Glossozamites Schenkii_[1546]\r\nare probably closely allied to _O. Bechei_. The Rhaetic species _O.\r\nBucklandi_ Schenk[1547], _O. indosinensis_ Zeill.[1548], and _O.\r\nPolakii_ Krass[1549], illustrate older examples of closely allied\r\ntypes. Zeiller records _Otozamites_ pinnae similar to those of _O.\r\nindosinensis_ from Rhaetic beds in Persia[1550].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites Beani_ (Lindley and Hutton).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 605. _Otozamites Bechei._ (British Museum, 40672;\r\n⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nFounded on a specimen in the Scarborough Museum from the Middle\r\nJurassic of Yorkshire[1551] which is indistinguishable from Leckenby’s\r\ntype-specimen of _Otopteris mediana_[1552] in the Sedgwick Museum,\r\nCambridge. Long and narrow fronds exceeding 20 cm. in length,\r\ncharacterised by the broadly oval, deltoid or sub-orbicular pinnae,\r\nseparate or partially imbricate and attached by a broad auriculate\r\nbase; apex bluntly rounded; veins numerous and spreading from the base\r\nof the lamina. The pinnae, which may be 3·5 cm. long and nearly 2 cm.\r\nbroad, are narrower and longer in the distal part of the frond (fig.\r\n606).\r\n\r\nThe Italian Jurassic species _Otozamites molianus_ Zig.[1553],\r\nrecorded also from Bornholm, is a very similar type. The generic name\r\n_Cyclozamia_ suggested by Pomel for this form of frond has not been\r\nadopted though it is applied by Schimper to _O. Bunburyanus_ Zig.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites Bunburyanus_ Zigno.\r\n\r\nA Jurassic species[1554] similar in the long and narrow form of the\r\nfrond to _O. Beani_ but distinguished by the much smaller segments\r\nand by their more orbicular lamina (fig. 606, B). In habit the\r\nfronds agree closely with the Fern _Nephrolepis Duffi_. Leckenby’s\r\nspecies, _Otopteris tenuata_[1555], is probably the same as Zigno’s _O.\r\nBunburyanus_, the type-specimen of which in the Padua Museum consists\r\nof a long and narrow frond with leaflets not exceeding 8 cm. in length;\r\nthe rachis is hidden by the imbricate auriculate bases of the leaflets.\r\nFeistmantel[1556] refers to this species some pieces of very narrow\r\nfronds with overlapping pinnae from Upper Gondwana beds in India. A\r\nstill smaller form is described by Möller[1557] from Bornholm as _O.\r\ntenuissimus_, and _O. Bunburyanus_ is recorded from the same flora. _O.\r\nFeistmanteli_ Zig.[1558] agrees in the form of the frond and in its\r\nshort and broad pinnae with _O. Bunburyanus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 606. A, _Otozamites Beani_. B, _Otozamites\r\nBunburyanus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 607. _Otozamites bengalensis_. (Indian Geological\r\nSurvey, Calcutta; ⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites bengalensis_ (Oldham and Morris).\r\n\r\nThis Indian species from the Rajmahal Hills[1559] and specimens of\r\nthe same type from the Cutch flora described as _O. contiguus_ Feist.\r\nafford another illustration of long and narrow fronds with short and\r\nrelatively broad pinnae. The drawings published by Oldham and Morris\r\naccurately represent the specimens: the longest frond is 21 cm. long\r\nand neither end is complete (fig. 607); it is 9 mm. broad at the\r\nnarrower end and 1·5 cm. at the broader end. The rachis is represented\r\nby a deep and broad groove; the actual bases of the leaflets are\r\nnot preserved, but their position shows that they were attached to\r\nthe upper face: this is clearly seen in the specimen described by\r\nFeistmantel as _O. contiguus_ which shows also that the lamina is\r\nauriculate at the upper edge of the base. The pinnae vary in shape;\r\nthe smaller ones are characterised by a strongly curved lower margin\r\nand the upper edge is slightly curved or straight, while the larger\r\nleaflets have more parallel edges and blunter rounded apices: the\r\nlatter form is well shown in the specimens unnecessarily distinguished\r\nby Oldham and Morris as var. _obtusa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites Klipsteinii_ (Dunker).\r\n\r\nThis Wealden species, first described by Dunker as _Cyclopteris\r\nKlipsteinii_[1560], is remarkable for the large pinnae. The rachis is\r\nfairly stout; the broadly oval or oblong pinnae vary considerably in\r\nsize and in the relation of breadth to length, in rare cases reaching\r\na length of over 8 cm. and a breadth of 2·4 cm.; apex obtuse, base\r\nslightly auriculate and asymmetrical; veins numerous, radiating from\r\nthe point of attachment to the margin of the lamina. The occurrence\r\nof finer lines between the more prominent veins may indicate the\r\npresence of hypodermal stereome strands. Fig. 608 illustrates the\r\nstriking variation in the size of the pinnae on a single frond and\r\ntheir attachment to the upper face of the rachis. In the breadth of\r\nthe segments _O. Klipsteinii_ resembles _O. Beani_ (Lind. and Hutt.),\r\n_O. decorus_ Sap.[1561], _O. lagotis_ Brongn.[1562] and two species\r\nfrom South Russia described by Thomas[1563] as _O. Izuimensis_ and\r\n_O. giganteus_. The pinnae of _O. giganteus_ exceed 10 cm. in length\r\nand 3 cm. in breadth, thus surpassing the largest segments of _O.\r\nKlipsteinii_. Some pinnae from the Jurassic flora of Oregon made by\r\nFontaine the type of a new species, _O. oregonensis_[1564], may be\r\nfragments of _O. Klipsteinii_. Nathorst[1565] records the occurrence in\r\nLower Cretaceous or Wealden beds in Spitzbergen of Cycadean leaflets\r\nvery like those of _O. Klipsteinii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otozamites Goeppertianus_ (Dunker).\r\n\r\nThis Wealden species, named by Dunker[1566] _Pterophyllum\r\nGoeppertianum_, agrees in habit with some of those to which\r\nreference is made under _O. Bechei, e.g. O. linearis_ Halle, and\r\nrepresents a type of the genus with unusually narrow pinnae (fig.\r\n603, A). The auriculate form of the lamina is feebly developed; the\r\nlinear-lanceolate pinnae are occasionally falcate and have acute\r\napices; as in many other species they were apparently deciduous. It is\r\nby no means easy to distinguish some of these fronds from specimens\r\nincluded in _Ptilophyllum pecten_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 608. _Otozamites Kliptsteini_. (British Museum,\r\nV. 3709; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=DICTYOZAMITES.= Oldham.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted[1567] for pinnate fronds from the\r\nRajmahal series of India, assigned by Feistmantel to a Lower Jurassic\r\nhorizon, but probably nearer in age to the Middle Jurassic series.\r\nMorris, joint author with Oldham of the Memoir on the Rajmahal plants,\r\nadopted the name _Dictyopteris_. _Dictyozamites_ agrees very closely\r\nwith _Otozamites_ but is readily distinguished by the anastomosing\r\nveins (fig. 609), while the absence of a midrib differentiates it\r\nfrom the Palaeozoic genus _Dictyopteris_. The genus is recorded also\r\nfrom Jurassic strata in England, Bornholm, Japan[1568], Korea[1569],\r\nand from a locality 60 nautical miles N.W. of Cape Horn in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego[1570]: the specimens from these localities differ only in\r\nunimportant details from the Indian type. _Dictyozamites_ is confined\r\nto Jurassic floras and appears to be especially characteristic\r\nof Middle Jurassic floras. In India[1571] fronds occur in close\r\nassociation with stems of the _Bucklandia_ type and, although there\r\nis no proof of any connexion with stems or flowers, it is probable\r\nthat the fronds of this generic type were borne on stems similar to\r\nthose of _Bucklandia_ and that the flowers were constructed on the\r\n_Williamsonia_ plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyozamites falcatus_ (Morris).\r\n\r\nMorris[1572] described this Rajmahal species under the names\r\n_Dictyopteris falcata_ and _D. falcata_ var. _obtusa_; the specimens\r\nwere included by Feistmantel under the designation _Dictyozamites\r\nindicus_, the original term _falcata_ being discarded without adequate\r\nreason. An examination of several of the figured fronds enables me\r\nto confirm the accuracy of the published drawings and to extend the\r\ndescription in a few particulars. Fronds pinnate of the habit of\r\n_Otozamites_; pinnae comparatively thick, broadly linear, alternate,\r\nvarying considerably in size and in the form of the apex which may\r\nbe obtuse or acute. The pinnae are attached by the middle part of\r\nthe lamina only; the upper edge of the base is slightly rounded or\r\nauriculate; the lower angle is generally more definitely lobed. The\r\nimbricate bases completely cover the upper face of the comparatively\r\nslender rachis. The longest pinna seen on an Indian frond is 6 cm. with\r\na breadth of 2 cm. Some of the pinnae on magnification exhibit a finely\r\ntuberculate appearance, due no doubt to the presence of papillae on\r\nthe epidermal cells like those on the pinnae of English and Bornholm\r\nspecimens. This species is recorded by Yokoyama[1573] from Japan as\r\n_D. falcatus_ var. _distans_, and a similar form, referred by him to a\r\ndistinct species, _D. grossinervis_, may be more appropriately named\r\n_D. falcatus_ var. _grossinervis_[1574]. The Indian type occurs also in\r\nJurassic rocks of Korea, and Halle has discovered some _Dictyozamites_\r\nleaves in Tierra del Fuego[1575] which he describes as _Dictyozamites_\r\nsp. _cf._ _D. falcatus_: this record is of special interest from a\r\nphytogeographical point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyozamites Johnstrupi_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis species[1576], from rocks usually spoken of as Liassic but not\r\nimprobably Middle Jurassic in age, differs from _D. falcatus_ in the\r\nslightly more falcate form of the pinnae and in the more strongly\r\nauriculate upper angle of the base of the lamina. The stomata[1577]\r\nare confined to the lower epidermis and the strongly cuticularised\r\nguard-cells frequently lie at right-angles to the course of the veins.\r\nThe epidermal cells have very sinuous walls (fig. 609, C) and in the\r\nmiddle of each is a prominent papilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyozamites Hawelli_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThis Middle Jurassic type from Marske[1578], Yorkshire, differs from\r\n_D. falcatus_ in the relatively broader segments, their straighter form\r\n(fig. 609, B), and in the attachment to the rachis being slightly below\r\nthe middle of the pinna base. Fig. 609, A, shows the base of a pinna\r\nand an oval scar similar to those on the rachis of some recent Cycads\r\n(_cf._ fig. 387). The epidermis is like that in _D. Johnstrupi_ and as\r\nin that species the stomata are confined to the lower surface. There\r\nare approximately 120 stomata per square millimetre; each with two\r\nsubsidiary cells (fig. 609, C) of elongated form, and the guard-cells\r\nhave small thickened outgrowths or papillae as in _D. Johnstrupi_.\r\n\r\nThe epidermal features are described under _D. Johnstrupi_ and _D.\r\nHawelli_ (fig. 609, C): a fuller account of those in the latter species\r\nwill be found in the paper by Mr Thomas and Miss Bancroft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 609. _Dictyozamites Hawelli._ (A, B, British\r\nMuseum; C, after Thomas and Bancroft.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=PTEROPHYLLUM.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe name _Pterophyllum_ was first applied by Brongniart[1579] to some\r\nfronds from the Lias of Höör, which he named _P. majus_ and _P. minus_,\r\nspecies subsequently removed by Nathorst[1580] to Schimper’s genus\r\n_Anomozamites_. Brongniart[1581] defined _Pterophyllum_ fronds, _e.g._\r\n_P. Jaegeri_ (fig. 610), as pinnate, bearing pinnules of almost equal\r\nbreadth attached by the whole width of the base and with a truncate\r\napex; veins slender, equal, simple and slightly arched. There has been\r\nconsiderable confusion and laxity in regard to the application of the\r\nname _Pterophyllum_ and in many cases no clear distinction has been\r\nrecognised between this genus and _Nilssonia_. In _Nilssonia_ the\r\ndistinctive feature is the complete absence of any rachis uncovered\r\nby the lamina on the upper face of well-preserved specimens, while\r\nin _Pterophyllum_ the continuity of the lamina is broken by a greater\r\nor less breadth of rachis in the middle line of the frond; the lamina\r\ndoes not cover the rachis but is attached laterally, or at least the\r\ntwo laminae of the frond, whether entire or deeply dissected, do not\r\nmeet in the middle of the rachis. A specimen from the Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland described by Heer as _Pterophyllum concinnum_[1582] and now\r\nin the Stockholm Museum is probably a piece of a _Nilssonia_; the\r\nrachis is not exposed on the surface of the frond. In _Nilssonia_ the\r\nveins are with few exceptions simple; in _Pterophyllum_ they are often\r\nbranched especially near their origin from the rachis: in _Nilssonia_\r\nthe segments are of unequal breadth; in _Pterophyllum_ they are\r\nusually equal. It has been the practice of several authors to follow\r\nSchimper[1583] in the employment of the generic name _Anomozamites_\r\nfor fronds with a more or less entire or irregularly pinnatisect\r\nlamina which bear a very close resemblance to _Nilssonia_ except that\r\na portion of the rachis is exposed on the upper face. Potonié[1584]\r\nused _Pterophyllum_ in a wider sense including both fronds with equal\r\npinnae and those of the _Anomozamites_ type: this more extended use\r\nof _Pterophyllum_ is adopted by Zeiller[1585] who prefers to retain\r\n_Anomozamites_ only as a sub-genus. It is in this sense that the\r\nfollowing definition is framed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 610. _Pterophyllum Jaegeri._ From the Keuper of\r\nLunz; part of a frond 23·5 cm. long and incomplete. (British Museum, V.\r\n1044; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nFronds pinnate; pinnae linear, attached by the whole base, which may be\r\nenlarged; the apex is truncate, rounded, or occasionally pointed; the\r\nveins are simple or dichotomously branched and parallel to the edge of\r\nthe lamina. In some fronds (sub-genus _Anomozamites_) the segments are\r\nunequal (fig. 615), short, broad and truncate, and the lamina may be\r\nentire or divided into a few very unequal segments. The surface of the\r\nrachis is never completely covered by the lamina on the upper face of\r\nthe frond and is often characterised by transverse wrinklings, possibly\r\ndue to the presence of ramental scales.\r\n\r\nSome interesting xerophilous features have recently been described by\r\nHalle[1586] in the lamina of _Pterophyllum (Anomozamites) marginatum_,\r\na Rhaetic species figured by Schenk and Nathorst from Franconia and\r\nScania. The pinnae were thick and succulent. Stomata are confined\r\nto the lower surface and the edges of the upper face of the lamina\r\nform a rounded curve causing the thick upper cuticle to abut on the\r\nthinner stomatiferous lower cuticle, thus producing in impressions the\r\nappearance of thickened margins.\r\n\r\nThere is no satisfactory evidence as to the nature of the reproductive\r\norgans or stems of the plants which bore fronds of the type represented\r\nby _P. Jaegeri_ (fig. 610) and other forms with equal segments. A\r\nstem referred by Heer[1587] and by Leuthardt[1588] to _Pterophyllum_\r\nwas not found in connexion with leaves, and there is the same absence\r\nof any convincing evidence in the case of the imperfect specimens\r\nfrom the Keuper of Basel believed by Leuthardt to be male and female\r\ninflorescences. On the other hand leaves of _Anomozamites_ are known\r\nto have been borne on comparatively slender stems with dichasial\r\nbranching, and the reproductive shoots are of the same general type\r\nas those known as _Bennettites_. This discovery is due to Nathorst\r\nwho founded the genus _Wielandiella_[1589] on fertile stems with\r\n_Anomozamites_ fronds. Mr Thomas[1590] has recently obtained evidence\r\nfrom Yorkshire Jurassic material pointing to a similar connexion\r\nbetween _Anomozamites_ fronds and _Wielandiella_ stems. _Pterophyllum_\r\nis further distinguished from _Nilssonia_ by the folded walls of the\r\nepidermal cells and by the presence of two crescentic subsidiary\r\ncells (fig. 611, A) instead of the ring of cells which surrounds the\r\nguard-cells in _Nilssonia_ (fig. 611, B). Schenk[1591] figured a few\r\npieces of cuticle from fronds referred to _Pterophyllum_ in which\r\nthe walls are more or less sinuous, but the cells of _Pterophyllum\r\ncrassinerve_ Goepp.[1592] appear to have straight walls: this species\r\nis, however, probably a _Nilssonia_. The stoma represented in fig.\r\n611, A, is from the lower epidermis of _Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_)\r\n_Nilssoni_ (Phill.)[1593].\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum_ extends from Upper Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous\r\nstrata and is especially characteristic of Keuper and Rhaetic floras.\r\nA possible representative of the sub-genus _Anomozamites_ is described\r\nby Ettingshausen from Tertiary beds in New South Wales as _Anomozamites\r\nMuelleri_[1594].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 611. A, _Pterophyllum Nilssoni_; B, _Nilssonia\r\nmediana_. (After Thomas and Bancroft.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Fayoli_ Renault and Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis species[1595] was founded on a large frond from the Commentry\r\ncoalfield with a stout rachis bearing linear pinnae, attached along\r\na narrow groove on its outer edge, reaching a length of 12 cm. and a\r\nbreadth of 1 cm.; adjacent pinnae are united at the base. The apices\r\nare pointed and there are 10–12 unbranched veins in the lamina. Fig.\r\n612 shows a small piece of the large specimen in the Natural History\r\nMuseum, Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum_ sp. Arber.\r\n\r\nThe only representative of a Carboniferous frond of Cycadean habit\r\ndiscovered in Britain is that recorded by Arber[1596] from Westphalian\r\nstrata at a depth of 1834 ft at Barfreston in Kent. A fairly stout\r\nrachis bears incomplete pinnae the longest of which is slightly more\r\nthan 1 cm. in length and 1–1·5 cm. broad; each segment, very slightly\r\ncontracted at the base, has 3–4 occasionally forked veins. Arber\r\ncompares the fragments with _Pterophyllum blechnoides_ Sand. from\r\nGermany[1597].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Cambryi_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThis Permian species from Autun[1598] is similar to _P. Fayoli_, but\r\ndiffers in the more slender rachis and in the finer venation of the\r\nlinear, acute, pinnae. The pinnae in Renault’s specimen reach a length\r\nof 4·8 cm. and are from 3·5–4 mm. broad; they are slightly confluent at\r\nthe base and the veins occasionally fork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 612. _Pterophyllum Fayoli_. (From the\r\ntype-specimen, Paris; ⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAmong other Palaeozoic species are _Pterophyllum Grand’Euryanum_ Sap.\r\nand Mar.[1599] discovered by Grand’Eury in the Coal Measures of France,\r\n_P. blechnoides_ Sand.[1600] from the Upper Coal Measures of Oppenau\r\nand recorded by Geinitz[1601] from the Middle Permian of Germany, _P.\r\nCottaeanum_ Gutb.[1602], a similar type, also from Permian rocks,\r\nbut with coarser venation. The specimens figured by Geinitz as _P.\r\nblechnoides_ and _P. Cottaeanum_ are in the Dresden Museum: the former\r\nspecies is represented by a good impression on shale which shows the\r\ngeneric characters very clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Jaegeri_ Brongniart.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[1603] founded this species (fig. 610) on material from the\r\nKeuper of Stuttgart. The fronds are characterised by the relatively\r\nnarrow parallel-sided pinnae with rounded or truncate apices and little\r\nor no basal contraction; the pinnae may be contiguous or separate.\r\nThere are 14–16 veins in each pinna. Leuthardt[1604], who figures\r\nseveral examples of this species from Keuper strata at Basel, speaks\r\nof the breadth-index of the pinnae as 12, a term employed to denote\r\nthe relation of the breadth to the length of a segment. _Pterophyllum\r\nlongifolium_[1605] is a very similar Keuper type: in this species\r\nthe pinnae are rather shorter and broader than in _P. Jaegeri_ and\r\ncontracted at the base; the apex is truncate or obtuse. The differences\r\nbetween these species is, however, very trifling. The imperfectly\r\npreserved fossils figured by Leuthardt[1606] as the inflorescences\r\nof _Pterophyllum_ have not been found in connexion with fronds and\r\ntheir nature is problematical. This and other species are recorded by\r\nKrasser[1607] from the Lunz beds in Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Bronni_ Schenk.\r\n\r\nA Keuper species[1608] from Raibl in Carinthia distinguished by its\r\nlarge pinnae, 15 cm. or more in length and 0·5 cm. broad, and by their\r\nalmost digitate disposition on the rachis. The fronds appear to be\r\nrelatively short: the upper pinnae are highly inclined while the lower\r\nare given off at an obtuse angle; they are obcuneate or more or less\r\noblanceolate, with a truncate asymmetrical apex and rounded angles; the\r\nbase is slightly contracted. Arber[1609] has figured some specimens\r\nfrom the Munich Museum in one of which there are five spreading pinnae\r\nand a portion of the rachis; one pinna is undoubtedly attached and\r\nthe others, though probably in place, are not in actual connexion\r\nwith the axis. There is a close resemblance between this species\r\nand _Sphenozamites Rogersianus_ Font.[1610]: in the American type\r\nthe fronds must have been 1 met. long; the leaflets, 19 × 9 cm., are\r\nelliptical, broadest near the apex and attached by the middle of the\r\nrounded base. Between the divergent and forked veins there is a fine\r\ngranulation probably due to the presence of papillae. _Pterophyllum\r\nBronni_ and _P. Rogersianum_ might be placed in Schimper’s genus\r\n_Macropterygium_[1611], though another Raibl species, originally\r\ndescribed by Schenk as _Pterophyllum giganteum_[1612] and referred by\r\nSchimper to _Macropterygium_, has much longer and relatively narrow\r\npinnae and agrees more closely with _Pterophyllum_ as the genus is\r\nusually defined. In order to emphasise the distinctive features of\r\n_Pterophyllum Bronni_ and Fontaine’s Virginian species they may\r\nconveniently be spoken of as _Pterophyllum (Macropterygium) Bronni_ and\r\n_Pterophyllum (Macropterygium) Rogersianum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 613. _Pterophyllum Braunianum._ (A, nat. size; B,\r\nenlarged; after Schenk.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Braunianum_ Goeppert.\r\n\r\nIn this Rhaetic species[1613] (fig. 613) the narrow linear pinnae,\r\ncontiguous or more or less distant, are 1–2 mm. broad and may exceed 5\r\ncm. in length though they are usually shorter; they are attached more\r\nor less at right-angles to the sides of a transversely wrinkled rachis.\r\nThe base of the lamina is broadened and the veins are parallel, simple\r\nor forked. The epidermal cells have sinuous walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Tietzei_ Schenk.\r\n\r\nA Rhaetic species founded[1614] on specimens from Persia and described\r\nalso by Zeiller[1615] from Tonkin represented by fronds 1 met. long\r\nand at least 15 cm. broad. The segments, 3–7 cm. long and 8–18 mm.\r\nbroad, are often set at right-angles to the rachis; the edges are\r\nparallel but the lower edge bends upwards at the apex. The veins are\r\nsimple or forked and approximately 0·3 mm. apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Bavieri_ Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis Rhaetic species from Tonkin[1616] and Persia[1617] is interesting\r\nas affording an example of a frond with exceptionally narrow and\r\ncontiguous pinnae. The frond is narrow and lanceolate, 15–20 cm. long\r\nwith pinnae normal to the rachis, ·5–1 mm. broad and 7–25 mm. long\r\nattached by the whole base which is sometimes slightly enlarged. The\r\nveins are simple or forked, ·15–·25 mm. apart: the apices of the\r\nsegments are rounded or truncate and the form of the whole is similar\r\nto that of _Pterophyllum aequale_ but narrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_) _inconstans_ Braun.\r\n\r\nIn habit this Rhaetic species[1618] resembles _Nilssonia compta_.\r\nThe linear-lanceolate fronds, as described by Zeiller[1619] in his\r\nTonkin memoir, attain a length of 20 cm. and a breadth of 4 cm. The\r\nrachis, characterised by numerous transverse ridges, bears alternate\r\nor sub-opposite leaflets often at right-angles; they are almost\r\nrectangular and hardly longer than broad, attached by the whole of the\r\nbase, which may be broadened, to the upper face of the rachis, but\r\nthe lamina does not cover the whole of the rachis as in _Nilssonia_.\r\nThe pinnae vary in breadth on the same frond and occasionally the\r\nlamina is continuous as in some forms of _Nilssonia_. Schenk[1620]\r\nfigures examples from the Rhaetic of Franconia in which the lamina\r\nis very irregularly dissected and may be entire for a considerable\r\ndistance. The epidermal cells have slightly sinuous walls. A similar\r\ntype is represented by _Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_) _Schenki_\r\nZeill.[1621], but the segments are contracted basally and become\r\nwider towards the apex where, as in _P. inconstans_, the edges are\r\nparallel. Feistmantel’s species _Platypterygium_ _Balli_[1622], though\r\nsuperficially similar to _Pterophyllum_, appears to agree more closely\r\nwith _Pseudoctenis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 614. A, B, _Pterophyllum Nathorsti_; A from below;\r\nB from above. C, _Nilssonia tenuicaulis_. (A, B, Gunn Collection,\r\nBritish Museum; C, Arber Coll. Sedgwick Museum, 539; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum Nathorsti_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on a specimen in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge,\r\nfrom the Middle Jurassic beds of Yorkshire, was formerly referred to\r\nthe genus _Dioonites_[1623], but since the Yorkshire specimens were\r\nsupplemented by material from Kimmeridge strata in Scotland[1624]\r\naffording more definite information with regard to the attachment of\r\nthe pinnae it has been transferred to _Pterophyllum_. Pinnae laterally\r\nattached to the rachis which in some specimens shows a transverse\r\nwrinkling, narrow, linear, 3–4 mm. wide and reaching a length of 9 cm.\r\nThe base of the segments is slightly expanded; the apex is acuminate\r\nor bluntly pointed: there are approximately three veins in 1 mm. of\r\nlamina. This type (fig. 614, A, B) is similar to _Pterophyllum aequale_\r\nBrongn. as figured by Zeiller[1625] from the Rhaetic of Tonkin and\r\nagrees closely with some of the large Rhaetic specimens referred by\r\nSchenk to _P. Braunianum_. The Jurassic fronds from Oregon described\r\nby Fontaine[1626] as _Ctenophyllum angustifolium_ are similar forms\r\nand a specimen from the Wealden of Germany included by Schenk in\r\n_P. Dunkerianum_[1627] should probably be included in this species.\r\nOther closely allied forms are represented by _P. distans_ Old. and\r\nMorr.[1628] and _P. Footeanum_ from India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 615. _Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_) _Nilssoni_.\r\n(British Museum, 39,306; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 616. _Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_)\r\n_Lyellianum_. (Geological Survey Museum, 6396; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_) _Nilssoni_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen, from the Jurassic beds on the Yorkshire coast\r\nand now in the York Museum, was described by Phillips[1629] as\r\n_Aspleniopteris Nilssoni_ and placed in _Pterophyllum_ by Lindley and\r\nHutton and many other authors[1630]. The fronds are linear; the lamina\r\nmay be almost entire or divided into unequal deep truncate segments;\r\nthe veins are simple or dichotomously branched (fig. 615). The leaves\r\nare very similar to those of _Nilssonia_; they were probably borne\r\non stems similar to those described by Nathorst as _Wielandiella_.\r\nReference is made to the structure of the epidermal cells in the\r\naccount of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterophyllum_ (_Anomozamites_) _Lyellianum_ (Dunker).\r\n\r\nThis Wealden species, originally referred by Dunker[1631] to\r\n_Pterophyllum_, was afterwards transferred to _Anomozamites_[1632]. The\r\nfronds, in habit resembling the larger Rhaetic species _P. Braunianum_\r\nGoepp., are characterised by the narrow linear pinnae of almost equal\r\nbreadth attached approximately at right angles; there is a narrow line\r\nof rachis separating the two rows of segments (fig. 616).\r\n\r\n\r\n{=CYCADITES.= Sternberg.\r\n{=PSEUDOCYCAS.= Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Cycadites_ was first used by Sternberg[1633] though\r\nit has since been shown that the specimens for which he proposed it\r\nbelong to other genera. As employed by Brongniart[1634] and other\r\nauthors _Cycadites_ stands for fossil fronds agreeing in habit with\r\nthe pinnate leaves of recent species of _Cycas_ (fig. 387, A); the\r\npresence of a single median in the linear pinnae is generally regarded\r\nas an essential feature. _Cycadites_ may be defined as follows: Fronds\r\npinnate; pinnae alternate or opposite, linear entire, with a midrib\r\nand no lateral veins, attached to the rachis by the entire base, the\r\nlower margin of which may be slightly decurrent or narrowed near the\r\npoint of attachment. Epidermal cells with straight walls and stomata\r\nagreeing in structure with those of the recent genus. As thus defined,\r\nincluding the characters of the epidermal cells, the genus has no\r\nrepresentatives; but the generic name should also be applied, as\r\nMiss Holden[1635] has recently suggested, to fronds of the _Cycas_\r\nform which afford no information with regard to the structure of the\r\nepidermis. The resemblance of _Cycadites_ fronds to those of _Cycas_,\r\ncoupled with the fact that impressions superficially resembling\r\nmegasporophylls of the recent genus are recorded from Mesozoic strata,\r\nwas considered sufficient justification for the employment of a name\r\nimplying close affinity to or even generic identity with _Cycas_. A\r\nfuller knowledge of the epidermal characters of some of the fronds\r\nhitherto included in _Cycadites_ has necessitated the substitution of a\r\nnew genus for _Cycadites_. An examination by Nathorst[1636] of Heer’s\r\nLower Cretaceous Greenland species _Cycadites Steenstrupi_ and of\r\nother fronds showed that the epidermal cell-walls are sinuous and the\r\nstomata arranged differently from those of _Cycas_. For these and other\r\nreasons Nathorst proposed a new name _Pseudocycas_. He also pointed out\r\nthat the pinnae in the fossil fronds have as a rule a double ‘midrib.’\r\nNathorst’s discovery raised the question whether other fronds described\r\nas _Cycadites_ should be transferred to _Pseudocycas_. Miss Holden’s\r\ninvestigation of other supposed Mesozoic representatives of _Cycas_\r\nleads to the conclusion that ‘it is not impossible that all Mesozoic\r\nspecimens of _Cycadites_ will turn out to be _Pseudocycas_.’ This\r\nobserver shows that _Cycadites Saportae_ Sew. and _C. Roemeri_ Schk.\r\nagree in the sinuous walls of the epidermal cells with _Pseudocycas_;\r\nand so far no species of _Cycadites_, in which it was possible to\r\nexamine the cuticular membrane, has been found that does not conform\r\nto Nathorst’s definition of _Pseudocycas_ at least as regards the\r\nstructure of the epidermal cells. Nathorst defined _Pseudocycas_ in the\r\nfollowing sense: Fronds similar to those of _Cycadites_ and _Cycas_\r\nbut with pinnae characterised by a double ‘midrib,’ the stomata being\r\nconfined or almost confined to the groove between the two ‘midribs.’\r\nNathorst also notes that in _Pseudocycas_ the bases of the pinnae are\r\nnot contracted as is often the case in _Cycadites_ and _Cycas_, but\r\nthis is a feature of secondary importance. Miss Holden has, however,\r\nexpressed the opinion that the double ‘midrib’ is an untrustworthy\r\ncharacter and that the stomata are not always arranged as in the fronds\r\nexamined by Nathorst. Nathorst states that in _Pseudocycas Steenstrupi_\r\nand _P. insignis_ the midrib though usually double may be single: the\r\nsame variation occurs in _P. Saportae_. Miss Holden found that an\r\nimpression made from a pinna of _Cycas siamensis_ showed a double line\r\non the upper face and a single rib on the lower; that is _Pseudocycas_\r\nand _Cycas_ characters occur on a single pinna. On drying, the ridge on\r\nthe lower face of the lamina collapses and a groove is formed bounded\r\nby two ridges.\r\n\r\nIn a recently published and interesting paper on ‘Some Xerophytic\r\nLeaf-structures in Mesozoic Plants,’ Dr Halle[1637] makes some\r\nimportant additions to our knowledge of _Pseudocycas_. He agrees\r\nwith Miss Holden’s views with regard to the use of the generic names\r\n_Pseudocycas_ and _Cycadites_, but dissents from her interpretation\r\nof the median groove as the result of shrinkage of a midrib. Part\r\nof the evidence presented by Halle is based on the structure of the\r\nleaf-cuticle as shown in microtome sections[1638]. He found that a\r\ndistinct median groove is always present on the pinnae of _Pseudocycas\r\ninsignis_ and other species. If the groove were due to collapse of\r\nthe tissue of a true median rib the presence of stomata—which in _P.\r\ninsignis_ are confined to the middle line of the lamina—below the vein\r\nwould be an unusual feature. He found no indication of a median vein\r\nor of any vascular tissue. All that is revealed by an examination\r\nof the cuticle is that the lamina has a well-defined groove bounded\r\nby prominent ridges, and in _Pseudocycas Roemeri_ the groove is\r\ndeeper and is formed by the bending-back of the lamina. The stomata\r\nare practically confined to the groove and in _P. insignis_ and _P.\r\nSteenstrupi_ an additional protection against excessive transpiration\r\nwas afforded by elongated papillae.\r\n\r\nIn the sinuous walls of the epidermal cells and in the structure of the\r\nstomata _Pseudocycas_ agrees with the Bennettitalean type as defined\r\nby Thomas and Bancroft[1639]. The ‘midrib’ of the pinnae marks the\r\nposition of a pronounced groove and we have no information with regard\r\nto the venation. As Halle says, protection against drought is afforded\r\nby ‘other means than those usual among existing Cycads,’ which provide\r\nagainst excessive transpiration by the sinking of the individual\r\nstomata below the surface. The epidermal features of _Pseudocycas_\r\nafford a striking example of the danger of basing conclusions on mere\r\nimpressions and they further emphasise the great difference between\r\nMesozoic Cycadean fronds and those of recent genera.\r\n\r\nWe have no knowledge of the nature of the reproductive organs of the\r\nplants which bore _Pseudocycas_ fronds, but the agreement of the\r\nstomata and epidermal cells with those in some Bennettitalean types\r\nfavours the inclusion of the genus in that class. It has previously\r\nbeen pointed out that the impression figured by Heer[1640] in close\r\nassociation with the Greenland specimens of _Pseudocycas Steenstrupi_\r\nas a carpellary leaf of the _Cycas_ type is much too imperfect to\r\nbe identified and has no claim, as an examination of the actual\r\nspecimen in the Copenhagen Museum convinced me, to be compared with a\r\nmegasporophyll of _Cycas_. This view is shared by Nathorst.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the name _Cycadites_ has been applied to fragments\r\nthat might equally well belong to Conifers or other plants, and not\r\ninfrequently a careful examination of fossils referred to _Cycadites_\r\nshows that the pinnae afford no evidence of a true midrib. Casts\r\nof revolute pinnae like those of the recent species _Encephalartos\r\nGhellinckii_ (fig. 382) would present an appearance closely resembling\r\na strong midrib. Heer’s Siberian Jurassic species _Cycadites\r\nsibiricus_[1641] is probably a piece of a _Taeniopteris_ or _Nilssonia_\r\nfrond, and _C. gramineus_ Heer[1642] should be referred to _Taxites_.\r\nAn examination of the Indian fronds described by Oldham and Morris and\r\nFeistmantel as species of _Cycadites_ leads me to discard all of them\r\nas trustworthy records of the genus: in _Cycadites confertus_[1643]\r\nand _C. Blandfordianus_[1644] there appear to be several veins in\r\nthe pinnae and not a single midrib. _Cycadites constrictus_[1645]\r\nis almost certainly a Conifer as Nathorst has also suggested. No\r\nsatisfactory example of _Cycadites_ has been described from Palaeozoic\r\nstrata; Goeppert’s _Cycadites gyrosus_[1646] is founded on material\r\ntoo imperfect to determine, and an examination of his Culm species _C.\r\ntaxodinus_ in the Breslau Museum led me to refer it to a Conifer. The\r\nspecimens figured[1647] by Zeiller from Lower Gondwana rocks in India\r\nas _Cycadites_? sp. are portions of linear leaves or leaflets 5 mm.\r\nbroad with a median rib but they can hardly be accepted as evidence of\r\nthe presence of a Cycadean plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 617. _Pseudocycas insignis._ From the Lias of\r\nHöör. A, ⅚ nat. size; B, _ca._ × 2. (After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudocycas insignis_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThe fronds of this Cenomanian species from the West of Greenland reach\r\na breadth of 16 cm.; the rachis, 1 cm. broad, has two parallel ridges\r\non the upper surface and to these are attached at a wide angle the\r\nbroad bases of narrow linear pinnae reaching a length of 9 cm. and a\r\nbreadth of 2–3 mm. (fig. 617). The pinnae are thick and separate and\r\neach has a double ‘midrib’ consisting of two parallel lines (fig.\r\n617, B) which are occasionally replaced by one. The so-called double\r\n‘midrib’ represents the two prominent ridges bordering the groove. The\r\nstomata, confined to the median groove, are approximately circular and\r\nthe short epidermal cells have sinuous walls[1648].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudocycas Steenstrupi_ (Heer).\r\n\r\nNathorst refers this species, described by Heer as _Cycadites_, from\r\nthe Cenomanian of Greenland, to _Pseudocycas_ on the ground that the\r\nepidermal cells are like those of _P. Steenstrupi_ and the stomata\r\nare confined to a median groove. Heer figures an impression in close\r\nassociation with the frond of this species which he identifies, without\r\nany adequate reason, as a carpellary leaf like that of a _Cycas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudocycas Saportae_ (Seward).\r\n\r\nIt has recently been shown by Miss Holden that this Wealden English\r\nspecies[1649] has the epidermal characters of _Pseudocycas_. In\r\nexternal form it agrees closely with _Cycadites tenuisectus_ Sap.[1650]\r\nfrom Lower Cretaceous rocks in Portugal, but nothing is known of\r\nthe epidermal features of the latter type. The rachis is broad and\r\nflattened and bears alternate or sub-opposite pinnae of uniform breadth\r\nattached at right-angles or obliquely to its upper surface (fig. 618).\r\nThe pinnae are 6–7 cm. long and about 1 mm. broad; their bases are\r\nslightly expanded and the apices sharply pointed. Miss Holden[1651]\r\nfinds that the median rib is sometimes double and that the middle\r\nregion of the lamina is covered with stomata; the epidermal cells have\r\nsinuous walls and stomata occasionally occur on each side of the main\r\nmedian stomatal area. Dr. Halle[1652] of Stockholm, who has examined\r\ncuticular preparations made from English specimens, confirms Miss\r\nHolden’s observations as regards the stomata, but he shows that there\r\nis no evidence of the existence of a midrib in the strict sense, the\r\nappearance of a single or double median vein being due to the presence\r\nof a dorsal stomatiferous groove, the edges of which would produce an\r\nimpression on the matrix of a double vein or, if the groove became\r\nnarrower, the impression would suggest a single midrib.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 618. _Pseudocycas Saportae._ From the Wealden,\r\nnear Hastings. (British Museum, V. 2777; ⅕ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudocycas Roemeri_ (Schenk).\r\n\r\nThis Wealden species recorded from North Germany[1653] and the Sussex\r\ncoast[1654] has broader pinnae laterally attached to the rachis. Miss\r\nHolden describes the stomata as covering the whole lower surface of the\r\npinnae except over the midrib. This description must be revised in the\r\nlight of Halle’s results obtained from an examination of the cuticle of\r\nthe type-specimen of the species in the Berlin Museum. He finds that\r\nthe edges of the pinnae are strongly revolute and thus form a deep\r\ndorsal canal which is almost closed[1655], a form of lamina, as seen in\r\nsection, very similar to that of an _Empetrum_ leaf. The stomata are\r\nconfined to the groove. It may be that the specimen examined by Miss\r\nHolden is specifically distinct or, as Halle also suggests, the cuticle\r\nobtained from the English fossil may not represent the whole surface\r\nbut only the walls of the canal with possibly a portion of the cuticle\r\nof the outer dorsal surface. This type of leaf described by Halle\r\nis similar to that of _P. insignis_ with the xerophilous character\r\nintensified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadites Saladini_ Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded by Zeiller[1656] on fronds from the Rhaetic of\r\nTonkin reaching a length of 40 cm. and 2–8·5 cm. broad with a rachis\r\n3–4 mm. wide bearing contiguous linear pinnae 1·5–4·5 cm. long and\r\n1·5–3 mm. broad with a more or less contracted base and a rounded or\r\nobtusely pointed apex. The pinnae are attached almost at right-angles\r\nor at an angle of 60°–80°. There is a clearly defined midrib.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that were the structure of the epidermal\r\ncells known this species would be found to be another example of\r\n_Pseudocycas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadites rectangularis_ Brauns.\r\n\r\nThis species[1657], first recorded from Rhaetic strata in Germany,\r\ndiffers in the narrower and more acutely pointed pinnae from _C.\r\nSaladini_. Miss Holden describes the midrib as double, but until\r\nspecimens are found which admit of an examination of the cuticles it is\r\nimpossible to decide whether it should be transferred to _Pseudocycas_.\r\nThe species is widely distributed in Rhaetic and Jurassic strata and\r\nspecimens are recorded from the Lias of Lyme Regis on the south coast\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycadites Renaulti_ Lignier.\r\n\r\nThis species, from the Middle Lias of Normandy[1658], is founded\r\non fronds 2·2–2·6 cm. broad with a rachis 3 mm. in breadth bearing\r\nlaterally-inserted pinnae almost at right-angles 11–12 mm. long and\r\n1·25–1·50 mm. broad; it is very similar to _C. rectangularis_ which\r\noccurs in the same beds.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. +Nilssoniales.+\r\n\r\n=NILSSONIA.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThis genus[1659] was named after the Swedish naturalist Nilsson who\r\nhad figured certain plants from the Lias of Höör referred by Fries to\r\nthe Ferns: these were named by Brongniart _Nilssonia brevis_ and _N.\r\nelongata_ and classed with the Cycads. The type-specimens of the latter\r\nspecies are regarded by Nathorst as a form of _N. brevis_. The history\r\nof the genus is fully discussed in Nathorst’s able monograph[1660].\r\n_Nilssonia_, founded on fronds which with one exception are known only\r\nas casts or impressions, may be thus defined: Fronds with circinate\r\nvernation, at least in the type-species _Nilssonia brevis_ (fig. 619,\r\nC, D), similar in shape to the leaves of _Scolopendrium vulgare_ and\r\n_Polypodium irioides_ and to such unusual forms of _Cycas_ fronds as\r\nthose reproduced in figs. 384, 387, I[1661], in which the laminae of\r\nthe pinnae are concrescent and form a continuous or deeply cut lamina.\r\nThey may reach a length of 60 cm. and a breadth of 10 cm. and some\r\nspecimens are known in which the leaf is less than 1 cm. in width. The\r\nlamina is occasionally entire, but in the great majority of cases it\r\nis more or less deeply cut into segments of unequal breadth varying\r\nconsiderably in size and shape even in the same species, usually deep\r\nand truncate and sometimes long and narrow (_e.g. N. pterophylloides_,\r\nfig. 619, B). An important distinguishing feature is the attachment\r\nof the lamina to the upper face of the rachis which it covers: the\r\nextension of the lamina over the surface of the frond axis and the\r\nrare occurrence of branching of the veins are characters in which\r\n_Nilssonia_ differs from _Taeniopteris_. The veins are given off at\r\nright-angles or obliquely from a very narrow groove occupying the\r\nmedian line of the rachis; they are nearly always simple and in some\r\nof the more fleshy leaves, _e.g. N. brevis_, they are seldom visible.\r\nThe surface of the lamina may be smooth or transversely corrugated. The\r\nrachis forms a prominent rib on the under surface of the frond (fig.\r\n620, A) and may be continued beyond the lamina as a short petiole.\r\nEpidermal cells polygonal or rectangular, with straight walls in\r\ncontrast to the sinuous walls of _Taeniopteris_; some of the cells bear\r\nstrongly cuticularised papillae, possibly the bases of hairs (compare\r\nthe hairs on the fronds of _Acrostichum crinitum_, a Fern with leaves\r\nsimilar in shape to some of the large entire fronds of _N. orientalis_\r\nthough relatively broader and with anastomosing veins). Stomata usually\r\nconfined to the lower epidermis and not very numerous; guard-cells\r\nof rounded contour and without any special thickening surrounded by\r\n6–8 accessory cells with thickened walls (fig. 611, B) forming a\r\nchimney slightly raised over the stomatal pore[1662]. In _Nilssonia_\r\nthe guard-cells do not exhibit that regularity of orientation which\r\ncharacterises the stomata of _Ptilophyllum_, _Otozamites_, and other\r\nBennettitalean fronds. Little is known of the anatomy of the leaves: in\r\na petrified leaf of _N. orientalis_[1663] from Upper Cretaceous rocks\r\nin Japan there is no palisade-tissue and small groups of sclerenchyma\r\noccur above and below the veins. The xylem appears to be centripetal,\r\nbut the preservation is far from satisfactory. A few secretory canals\r\nwere found near the edge of the leaf. We have no certain knowledge of\r\nthe reproductive organs. The small circular projections figured by\r\nSchenk[1664] on some leaves of _Nilssonia polymorpha_ as sporangia\r\nhave no claim to be so regarded. In the description of _N. brevis_\r\nreference is made to some seeds discovered by Nathorst which may belong\r\nto that species. Nathorst suggests the possibility that the Rhaetic\r\nfossil _Stenorrachis scanicus_ Nath. may be the seed-bearing shoot of a\r\n_Nilssonia_, either _N. brevis_ or _N. polymorpha_, and if this surmise\r\nis correct it almost necessarily involves the genus _Beania_[1665]\r\nwhich has been tentatively referred to the Ginkgoales though without\r\nany convincing evidence to support such connexion. Nothing is known of\r\nthe stems: the occasional occurrence of leaves converging towards a\r\ncommon support points to a Cycadean habit. It is possible, as Nathorst\r\nsuggests, that the Rhaetic species _Bucklandia Saportana_[1666] may be\r\nthe stem of a _Nilssonia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 619. A, seed (_Nilssonia_?); B, _Nilssonia\r\npterophylloides_; C, D, _Nilssonia brevis_; E, _N. polymorpha_. (A–D ⅚\r\nnat. size; E, slightly enlarged; after Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia_ is especially characteristic of Jurassic and Rhaetic\r\nfloras; it occurs also in Triassic beds and extends into Cretaceous\r\nfloras.\r\n\r\nNathorst instituted the genus _Nilssoniopteris_[1667] for some\r\nspecimens from the Yorkshire coast which he believed to be examples of\r\n_Nilssonia tenuinervis_ on the ground that the veins are dichotomously\r\nbranched and the epidermal cells have sinuous walls. Mr Hamshaw\r\nThomas[1668] has, however, shown by an examination of the specimens in\r\nthe Stockholm Museum that they belong to _Taeniopteris vittata_, and\r\nProf. Nathorst agrees with this conclusion. The name _Nilssoniopteris_\r\nmust therefore be abandoned. Miquel[1669] proposed the name _Hisingera_\r\nfor some _Nilssonia_ fronds, but it has not been adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia polymorpha_ Schenk.\r\n\r\nLinear fronds varying considerably in breadth and in the degree\r\nof dissection of the lamina, which may be entire; the margin may\r\nshow broad and shallow crenulations or there may be a few narrow\r\nand deep sinuses cutting the otherwise entire lamina into long and\r\nnarrow segments. More usually the lamina is divided to the rachis\r\ninto numerous truncate segments traversed by parallel, simple, veins\r\nextending from a narrow groove in the middle of the rachis on the\r\nupper surface of the frond (fig. 619, E). The veins run in very narrow\r\ngrooves in the generally flat but occasionally corrugated lamina[1670].\r\n\r\nThis species agrees very closely in habit with _N. compta_ and _N.\r\nbrevis_ and, as Nathorst points out, it is in some cases almost\r\nimpossible to distinguish _Nilssonia polymorpha_ from _N. brevis_.\r\nSome of the fronds from the Rhaetic of Franconia described by Schenk\r\nas _N. polymorpha_ are examples of _N. brevis_. In _N. polymorpha_ the\r\ndistal ends of the segments are blunter, the lamina is much less folded\r\nand when folds or corrugations occur they are less regular than in _N.\r\nbrevis_. The epidermal cells are polygonal and have thick, straight,\r\nwalls: oval or circular papillae occur both on the lamina and rachis.\r\nThe stomata, confined to the lower surface, are between the veins and\r\neach is accompanied by a ring of subsidiary cells (_cf._ fig. 611, B).\r\n_N. polymorpha_ is a member of Rhaetic floras and is recorded also from\r\nLiassic rocks at Höör[1671].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 620. A, B, _Nilssonia brevis_; A, section of\r\nthe frond; B, section of the lamina parallel to the rachis. C, _N.\r\nsaighensis_. (A, B, after Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia brevis_ Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThis species[1672] (fig. 619, C, D), one of those from Höör on\r\nwhich the genus was founded, has been very fully investigated by\r\nNathorst[1673] whose researches have cleared up many obscure features.\r\nThe young fronds are circinate like those of Ferns and _Cycas_. The\r\nlinear fronds agree generally in habit with those of _N. polymorpha_\r\nand _N. compta_, but the lamina is thicker and is characterised by\r\nregular transverse corrugations; the veins are very rarely visible\r\nexcept in young leaves which have not reached their full thickness.\r\nThe fronds may be 50 cm. long and vary in breadth from 1·5 to 12 cm.;\r\nthe petiole is very short or the frond may be sessile. Between the\r\nregular grooves on the upper surface the lamina is more or less convex;\r\nseen from below the grooves are represented by ridges and between each\r\npair of ridges there are parallel folds, sometimes three (fig. 620,\r\nB) or as many as six; and where the segments are narrow, that is the\r\nstrips of lamina between two grooves (or ridges), there may be only\r\na single fold which gives the appearance of linear segments with a\r\nsingle midrib as in _Cycadites_, a misleading resemblance of special\r\ninterest in reference to the _Nilssonia_ fronds described by Oldham and\r\nMorris[1674] and by Feistmantel[1675] as _Cycadites rajmahalensis_.\r\nOwing to the fleshy nature of the leaf the difference between the\r\nupper and lower side is particularly well marked in this species. The\r\nlamina may be more or less entire, but is usually divided by deep\r\nsinuses extending to the rachis into truncate or distally tapered\r\nsegments varying in breadth (fig. 619, C, D), the narrow segments being\r\ncharacterised by a more pointed apex than in _N. polymorpha_. The\r\nstructure of the stomata and epidermal cells is of the type described\r\nin the definition of the genus. Strongly cuticularised papillae,\r\nincorrectly described by Schenk[1676] in _N. polymorpha_ as stomata,\r\noccur on some of the epidermal cells: these may be the bases of hairs.\r\nIn some preparations Nathorst found patches of a resinous substance,\r\nan interesting discovery in view of the occurrence of secretory canals\r\nin the petrified leaf of _Nilssonia orientalis_ described by Dr\r\nStopes[1677].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 621. _Nilssonia rajmahalensis_ (= _Cycadites\r\nrajmahalensis_). (Indian Geological Survey, Calcutta; nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia brevis_ occurs in Upper Rhaetic and Lower Liassic strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia pterophylloides_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nA Rhaetic Scanian species originally referred by Nathorst[1678] to\r\n_Nilssonia_ but later removed by him to _Dioonites_[1679] and in\r\n1909 reinstated in _Nilssonia_[1680] on the ground that the lamina\r\ncovers the upper face of the rachis. The segments are fairly uniform\r\nin breadth and linear; they reach 10 cm. in length and are usually\r\n5–7 mm. broad; the lamina is slightly tapered towards the apex (fig.\r\n619, B). There are 3–10 parallel grooves on the upper face of the\r\nsegments and between each pair is a single unbranched vein. In close\r\nassociation with portions of three fronds of this species Nathorst\r\nfound several oval bodies, 1 cm. × 7 mm., which he at first regarded\r\nas ‘antherangia’ comparable with the sporocarps of the Hydropterideae,\r\nbut an examination of the carbonised tissue demonstrated that the small\r\nrounded bodies contained in each of the ‘antherangia,’ originally\r\nbelieved to be pollen-sacs, are grains of resin internal to a cuticle\r\nof thick-walled cells and probably formed by secretory sacs in a fleshy\r\ntissue. Internal to the resin-bodies is a second cuticle which may be\r\nthe remains of a nucellus, the outer cuticle and the resin belonging\r\nto the sarcotesta. Nathorst’s careful examination of these fossils\r\nshows that they are seeds (fig. 619, A) and were probably borne on\r\nplants of _N. pterophylloides_, though an accidental association is not\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia compta_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nBroadly linear fronds varying considerably in size and in the breadth\r\nand number of the truncate segments. In some cases the fronds exceeded\r\n40 cm. in length and had a breadth of 9 cm. (fig. 622). The veins are\r\nsimple, parallel, and fairly prominent and the lamina shows clearly\r\nthe attachment to the upper surface of the rachis which is covered\r\nby it as in all species of the genus[1681]. The structure of the\r\nepidermis and stomata has recently been described by Thomas[1682].\r\nBrongniart mentioned in the _Prodrome_ a species from the Lower Oolite\r\nof Yorkshire under the name _Pterophyllum Williamsonis_[1683], but in\r\na later work this is given as a synonym of _N. compta_. _Nilssonia\r\ncompta_ bears a close resemblance in habit to _N. polymorpha_; it\r\nagrees also with the large fronds described from the Upper Gondwana\r\nof India as _Pterophyllum princeps_[1684]. Since attention was first\r\ncalled to this similarity an examination of several of the figured\r\nspecimens has convinced me that the Indian fronds are either identical\r\nwith or at least closely allied to the European leaves. The apparent\r\nlateral attachment of the lamina in the drawings published by Oldham\r\nand Morris and Feistmantel is due to imperfect preservation; the\r\nlamina ends in two raised ridges, and the discovery of a specimen\r\nin which the lamina completely covers the rachis confirmed the\r\nimpression made by the other specimens. The Amurland Jurassic species\r\n_Nilssonia Schmidtii_[1685] Heer though probably not identical with\r\n_N. compta_ is a very similar type; it was originally described by\r\nHeer as _Anomozamites Schmidtii_ and transferred by Nathorst[1686] to\r\n_Nilssonia_: the veins are occasionally forked near the rachis and are\r\nrather farther apart (·5 mm.) than in _N. compta_ and the segments are\r\nbroader and deeper than in the English species. _Nilssonia nipponensis_\r\nYok.[1687] a Jurassic species recorded from Japan and North America is\r\nanother similar type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 622. _Nilssonia compta._ (Whitby Museum; nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia orientalis_ Heer.\r\n\r\nIn this Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous species, founded on material from\r\nJurassic rocks in Siberia[1688], the lamina is generally entire. The\r\nfronds exhibit a wide range in size and shape; they may have the form\r\nof very narrow linear leaves barely 1 cm. across or may reach a breadth\r\nof nearly 10 cm. The leaves from Middle Jurassic British strata named\r\nby Nathorst _N. tenuinervis_[1689] are probably identical with Heer’s\r\ntype, and _N. Johnstrupi_[1690] Heer from the Lower Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland may also be referred to _N. orientalis_.\r\n\r\nThe veins are at right-angles or oblique to the rachis and are very\r\nnumerous, three or more in a breadth of 1 mm.[1691] A species recently\r\ndescribed by Halle[1692] from Graham Land as _N. taeniopteroides_\r\nagrees closely in habit with _N. orientalis_: in the southern form\r\nthe frond may have a length of 40–50 cm. and a breadth of 3 cm. The\r\nentire lamina of _N. taeniopteroides_ tapers gradually towards the\r\nbase and is more rapidly narrowed in the distal region; the petiole is\r\nat least 6–7 cm. long: the simple or branched veins, 15–20 in 1 cm.,\r\nare given off from the axis at a wide angle. The more crowded veins in\r\n_N. orientalis_ constitute one of the few features in which it differs\r\nfrom Halle’s species, but the fact that the degree of closeness of the\r\nveins is inconstant within the same species renders this distinction of\r\ndoubtful value. Halle compares his species also with _N. densinervis_\r\n(Font.) originally described as _Platypterigium densinerve_ from\r\nthe Potomac beds[1693] and afterwards transferred by Berry[1694] to\r\n_Nilssonia_ and considered by him to be identical with Fontaine’s\r\n_Platypterigium Rogersianum_. An examination of some of Fontaine’s\r\nspecimens in the Washington Museum led me to refer the fronds to\r\n_Nilssonia_[1695].\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak with confidence as to the absolute\r\nspecific identity of _N. orientalis_ Heer, _N. Johnstrupi_ Heer,\r\n_N. taeniopteroides_ Halle, and some similar forms; but it is clear\r\nthat the linear fronds of this type characterised by an entire or\r\noccasionally pinnatisect lamina were widely distributed in Jurassic\r\nand Lower Cretaceous strata and persisted to the Upper Cretaceous\r\nseries in Japan. This form of frond is recorded from England, Scotland,\r\nNorth America, Greenland, Spitzbergen[1696], Siberia, Russia,\r\nAfghanistan[1697], Japan[1698], Graham Land, and elsewhere. Reference\r\nhas already been made to a petrified specimen of _N. orientalis_\r\ndescribed by Dr Stopes from Japan[1699].\r\n\r\nSpecimens described by Salfeld[1700] from the Corallian of Germany as\r\n_Taeniopteris_ sp. may be _N. orientalis_; Bartholin’s _N. polymorpha_\r\nfrom Bornholm, Velenovský’s Lower Cretaceous _N. bohemica_ and\r\nYokoyama’s _N. ozvana_ from Japan are other examples of fronds which\r\nmay be identical with _N. orientalis_[1701].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia tenuicaulis_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nThis Jurassic species, while agreeing generally in habit with _N.\r\ncompta_, is characterised by the narrow and numerous linear segments\r\nwith a more acuminate apex. The fronds reached a length of more than\r\n20 cm.[1702] Leckenby’s name _Pterophyllum medianum_[1703] was given\r\nto a specimen from the Yorkshire coast and now in the Sedgwick Museum,\r\nCambridge, which, with _Pterophyllum angustifolium_, is clearly\r\nidentical with _Cycadites tenuicaulis_ Phillips. The specific name\r\n_mediana_ frequently used[1704] for this type should be given up in\r\nfavour of the older term _tenuicaulis_. A species of similar habit is\r\ndescribed but not figured by Krasser[1705] as _N. Sturii_ from the Lunz\r\nbeds. _N. tenuicaulis_ is fairly common in the Middle Jurassic beds\r\nnear Scarborough and is recorded from the Kimmeridgian of Scotland\r\nunder the name _N. mediana_ (fig. 614, C)[1706].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia princeps_ (Oldham and Morris).\r\n\r\nOldham and Morris speak of _Pterophyllum princeps_[1707] as one of\r\nthe commonest plants in the Rajmahal beds in India. The fronds are\r\ncharacterised by their large size and by the very broad oblong and\r\ndistally truncate pinnae with parallel and occasionally branched\r\nveins. In the specimens figured by Oldham and Morris and Feistmantel\r\nthe pinnae are cut off at their bases (fig. 623), which form ridges\r\nparallel to the rachis: this feature is not clearly shown in the\r\npublished drawings. By breaking some pieces of rock from a slab\r\ncontaining figured specimens other pieces were found in which the\r\nlaminae of the bases of segments meet in the middle of the upper face\r\nof the rachis. The pinnae vary in breadth from 1 cm. to 3·5 cm. and\r\nreach a length of 8 cm.; the distal end is truncate, the lower edge\r\nbeing strongly curved: the segments are slightly broadened at the base.\r\nThe veins are prominent and parallel, from 0·5 to 0·8 mm. apart. The\r\nRajmahal fronds described as _Pterophyllum Morrisianum_[1708] appear\r\nto be indistinguishable from this species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 623. _Nilssonia princeps._ (Slightly reduced;\r\nIndian Geological Survey, Calcutta.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nilssonia Schaumburgensis_ (Dunker).\r\n\r\nThis species, first described as _Pterophyllum Schaumburgense_[1709]\r\nfrom the Wealden of Germany, affords a good illustration of a small\r\ntype of frond closely resembling the much larger species _N. compta_.\r\nExamples from English Wealden rocks seldom exceed 1 cm. in breadth and\r\nare often much narrower; the linear lamina is almost entire or divided\r\ninto short and broad truncate segments of unequal breadth: the veins\r\nare parallel and simple. For figures of this species, recorded from\r\ndifferent European localities and from Japan, reference should be made\r\nto the accounts by Schenk[1710], Nathorst, Yokoyama, Yabe, and Fontaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CTENIS.= Lindley and Hutton.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ctenis_[1711] was founded on a piece of pinnate frond\r\nfrom the Middle Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire coast previously\r\nfigured by Phillips as _Cycadites sulcicaulis_. Lindley and Hutton\r\nregarded the plant as probably Cycadean and proposed to apply the name\r\n_Ctenis_ to all leaves having the general characters of Cycadeae, but\r\nwith ‘the veins connected by forks or transverse bars.’ While many\r\nauthors have accepted _Ctenis_ as a Cycadean genus, by others[1712]\r\nit has been placed among the Ferns, on the ground that some small\r\ncircular elevations on the lamina of the segments of certain species\r\nare believed to be sori or sporangia. Since Ettingshausen[1713]\r\nand Schenk[1714] first noticed this feature Raciborski[1715] has\r\nfigured several examples from Poland and Staub[1716] records similar\r\ncircular bodies on a Liassic Hungarian species. In no single instance\r\nhave sporangia been found. Nathorst[1717] proposed the designation\r\n_Anthrophyopsis_ (because of the resemblance of the lamina in form\r\nand venation to the leaves of the Fern _Anthrophyum_) for some\r\nRhaetic specimens from Scania, but as they were subsequently found\r\nto be segments of a pinnate frond he adopted the name _Ctenis_. An\r\nexample in the Manchester Museum[1718] (fig. 624) from Yorkshire,\r\nmentioned by Nathorst in an early paper as probably a new species of\r\n_Anthrophyopsis_, afforded good preparations of the cuticle (fig.\r\n625) which revealed the existence of circular elevations on the outer\r\nwalls of the epidermal cells: these may explain the nature of some at\r\nleast of the supposed sporangia. The walls of the epidermal cells\r\nare straight. The name _Ctenis_ is applied to pinnate fronds which\r\nare probably Cycadean though we have no evidence as to the nature of\r\nthe stem or the reproductive organs. _Ctenis_ fronds are among the\r\nlargest Cycadean leaves from Mesozoic floras; in _Ctenis hungarica_\r\nStaub the frond is said to have reached a length of 2 met. and in other\r\nspecies the dimensions exceed those of most pinnate leaves. The stout\r\nrachis bears linear or broad-oblong pinnae attached at a wide angle\r\nand varying considerably in size and shape; the pinnae are attached\r\nby the whole base which is usually broadened and decurrent but in a\r\nfew cases slightly contracted (_e.g._ _C. Zeyschneri_ Rac.[1719]). For\r\nsome fronds bearing broad and basally narrowed segments Raciborski\r\nproposed the name _Ctenidiopsis_ in distinction from _Euctenis_ which\r\nhe applies to the typical forms. The pinnae may be long and narrow\r\nreaching a length of over 12 cm., or short and broad: in some cases the\r\nfrond would be more correctly described as deeply pinnatisect; the apex\r\nof the segments is acute, bluntly rounded or truncate. Several veins\r\npass into the base of each pinna and pursue a course approximately\r\nparallel to the edge of the lamina; a characteristic feature is the\r\noccasional occurrence of oblique cross-connexions between the veins.\r\nIt is possible that in some species the pinnae had spinous margins\r\nas in the pinnae of uncertain affinity figured by Fontaine[1720] as\r\n_Encephalartopsis nervosa_ from the Potomac series. Our knowledge of\r\nthe epidermal cells is very meagre: in the specimen represented in fig.\r\n625 the epidermal cells have straight walls and a central papilla. The\r\ngenus extends from Triassic to Upper Jurassic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 624. _Ctenis_ sp. Single pinna. (Manchester\r\nMuseum, No. 53.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 625. _Ctenis_ sp.

(Manchester Museum, No. 53.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis lunzensis_ Stur.\r\n\r\nThis species, first recorded by Stur from the Lunz Upper Triassic\r\nflora, has recently been examined by Krasser[1721] and compared with\r\nthe Jurassic species _Ctenis sulcicaulis_ (Phill.) (= _C. falcata_\r\nLind. and Hutt.) and _C. Potocki_ Rac. No figures or detailed\r\ndescriptions have been published.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis fallax_ Nathorst.\r\n\r\nThis Scanian Rhaetic type[1722], including _Anthrophyopsis\r\ncrassinervis_, _A. Nilssoni_, and probably _A. obovata_ Nath., is\r\ncharacterised by very large obtusely pointed pinnae reaching at least\r\n20 cm. in length and over 3 cm. in breadth. The veins are often 2 mm.\r\napart and form long polygonal meshes. Nathorst figures small circular\r\npatches on the surface of the lamina. Raciborski[1723], on slender\r\nevidence, refers a fragment from the Jurassic of Cracow to this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis hungarica_ Staub.\r\n\r\nA species[1724] characterised by very large fronds reaching 2 met.,\r\nbearing broad linear pinnae almost at right-angles and attached to the\r\nrachis by decurrent bases, attaining a length of 21 cm. and a breadth\r\nat the base of the lamina of 3·5 cm. and 4 cm. a short distance from\r\nthe acute apex. The veins are parallel to the edge of the lamina, but\r\nStaub does not appear to have seen distinct anastomoses. It is not\r\nimprobable that Staub’s species may be identical with _C. asplenioides_\r\n(Ett.) from the Lias of Hungary, specimens of which are preserved in\r\nthe École des Mines, Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis asplenioides_ (Ettingshausen).\r\n\r\nThis species was first described by Ettingshausen[1725] from Liassic\r\nstrata in Austria as _Taeniopteris asplenioides_ and compared by him to\r\nlarge simple fronds of _Asplenium nidus_ but distinguished by a deeply\r\ndissected lamina. Schenk[1726] found that the veins anastomose and\r\nadopted the name _Ctenis_. In habit very similar to _C. sulcicaulis_,\r\nbut the pinnae are much broader, exceeding 4 cm., and the veins are\r\n3–5 mm. apart. Only the basal part of the segments is figured by\r\nEttingshausen. Specimens in the École des Mines, Paris, from Hungary\r\nhave pinnae nearly 40 cm. long and 2·5 cm. in breadth, the parallel\r\nveins being connected by a few oblique branches. Both Ettingshausen\r\nand Schenk speak of small circular sori on the lower epidermis,\r\nthough these are not figured nor were any sporangia obtained. This\r\nspecies and other examples of large _Ctenis_ fronds are described by\r\nRaciborski from Lower Jurassic rocks in Poland. He figures part of a\r\nleaf of _C. Zeyschneri_[1727] 40 cm. long bearing alternate pinnae\r\napproximately 10 cm. long and nearly 4 cm. broad, characterised by\r\nobtuse apices, a decurrent lamina, and anastomosing veins closer\r\ntogether (16–24 per 1 cm.) than those of _C. asplenioides_. In one\r\nPolish specimen, _C. remotinervis_[1728], with pinnae 5 cm. broad the\r\nlamina is represented in the upper part of the frond as continuous over\r\nthe face of the rachis, and—if the drawing is accurate—the frond in\r\nthis respect differs from typical examples of _Ctenis_ and agrees with\r\n_Nilssonia_. A species of _Ctenis_ with broad pinnae is described by\r\nYokoyama[1729] from the Jurassic of China as _C. Kaneharai_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis sulcicaulis_ (Phillips).\r\n\r\nThis type[1730] is more familiar under the name _Ctenis falcata_\r\ngiven to it by Lindley[1731], but if we follow Lester Ward[1732] in\r\nstrict observance of the rule of priority, a course from which I have\r\nfrequently deviated on the ground of long usage, the less familiar\r\ndesignation must be adopted. Fronds pinnate; long and tapered linear\r\npinnae sometimes exceeding 12 cm. in length and 1 cm. in breadth\r\nattached obliquely or almost at right-angles to a fairly broad rachis\r\n(fig. 626). The lamina is broadest at the base and the lower margin is\r\nstrongly decurrent, tapering distally to an acute apex. The parallel\r\nand frequently anastomosing veins diverge slightly in the basal region\r\nof the pinnae. Though usually separate to the base, the laminae of\r\nadjacent pinnae may be continuous as in a pinnatisect leaf[1733]. This\r\nspecies is recorded also from North America, and fronds of similar\r\nhabit are figured by Fontaine[1734] from the Jurassic of Oregon as\r\n_Ctenis orovillensis_: a fragment recorded from Jurassic rocks in\r\nAfghanistan as _Ctenis_ sp. may belong to _C. sulcicaulis_[1735].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis latifolia_ (Brongniart).\r\n\r\nThis species[1736], originally referred to _Taeniopteris_, was\r\ntransferred to _Ctenis_ as the result of the discovery of anastomosing\r\nveins in the type-specimen in the Oxford Museum. The segments are\r\nshorter and broader than in _C. sulcicaulis_ and very similar to those\r\nof _C. orovillensis_ Font.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 626. _Ctenis sulcicaulis._ (British Museum, V.\r\n9012.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenis_ sp.\r\n\r\nThe pinna shown in fig. 624 from the Jurassic beds in Yorkshire[1737]\r\nis interesting as one of the few examples of the preservation of the\r\ncuticular membrane. The straight or curved walls of the epidermal\r\ncells agree with those of recent Cycads except _Stangeria_, and each\r\ncell bears a large central papilla that gives to the lamina the finely\r\npunctate appearance which has been regarded as evidence of sporangia.\r\nThe gaps in the cuticle probably mark the position of sunken stomata.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PSEUDOCTENIS.= Seward.\r\n\r\nThis genus[1738] was established for certain pinnate fronds agreeing\r\nin habit with _Ctenis sulcicaulis_ but distinguished by the almost\r\ncomplete absence of any cross-connexions between the veins. Some of\r\nthe forms with narrow pinnae closely resemble species of _Zamites_,\r\nthe distinguishing feature being the decurrent lower margin of the\r\nleaflets. Though such fronds might not unreasonably be included in\r\n_Ctenis_, it is more convenient on the analogy of the occasional\r\noccurrence of _Glossopteris_ fronds with very few anastomoses to employ\r\na distinctive designation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 627. _Pseudoctenis eathiensis._ (British Museum,\r\nNo. V. 2744; ½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudoctenis eathiensis_ (Richards).\r\n\r\nSome of the specimens on which this species[1739] is founded were\r\noriginally figured by Miller[1740] from Upper Jurassic strata in\r\nScotland and afterwards named by Richards[1741] _Zamites eathiensis_.\r\nThe general appearance of the fronds is very like that of _Ctenis\r\nsulcicaulis_; the pinnae vary in breadth from about 3 mm. to 1·5 cm.;\r\nthey are attached at right-angles or, in the apical region, may be\r\nalmost parallel to the rachis. The longest pinna recorded is 17 cm.\r\nand the lamina tapers to a slender apex; the veins are parallel and\r\noccasionally forked, but cross-connexions are rare. The partially\r\npetrified rachis of one specimen showed hypodermal stereome and some\r\nsecretory canals as in recent Cycads. The specimen from Wealden rocks\r\nnear Hastings (fig. 627), originally described as _Zamites_ sp.[1742],\r\nis probably specifically identical with _Pseudoctenis eathiensis_.\r\nThe South African Wealden species, originally described by Tate as\r\n_Palaeozamia Rubidgei_[1743], agrees closely with _Pseudoctenis_ and is\r\nprobably an example of that genus. This type bears a close resemblance\r\nin the form of the frond to _Ctenophyllum grandifolium_ Font.[1744]\r\nand _C. Wardi_[1745] Font. from American Trias and Jurassic rocks\r\nrespectively. _Pseudoctenis crassinervis_ Sew.[1746] is another Scotch\r\nform with coarser veins.\r\n\r\nA frond very similar in habit to _P. eathiensis_ is represented by\r\n_Pseudoctenis ensiformis_ Halle[1747] from the Jurassic strata of\r\nGraham Land originally referred by Nathorst to _Pterophyllum_. An\r\nexamination of the type-specimen in the Stockholm Museum revealed its\r\nresemblance to the Scotch species _P. eathiensis_: a single anastomosis\r\nwas noticed in one of the pinnae. The broadly ensiform obtuse pinnae,\r\nreaching a length of 7 cm. with a maximum breadth of 3 cm. at their\r\nexpanded bases, vary in breadth and are attached at right-angles to a\r\nslender rachis. The veins, 1–1·5 mm. apart, are parallel and strong.\r\nThe varying breadth of the pinnae irrespective of their position on the\r\nrachis is a distinctive feature. Halle draws attention to a resemblance\r\nof this Antarctic species to _Ctenophyllum latifolium_ Font. a Potomac\r\ntype referred by Berry[1748] to the genus _Ctenopsis_ on the rather\r\nslender ground that the veins are arranged in pairs. Berry in a\r\nfootnote expresses the opinion that _Ctenopsis_ is very closely related\r\nto or possibly identical with _Pseudoctenis_.\r\n\r\nIf the bases of the pinnae in the specimen of _P. ensiformis_ figured\r\nby Halle are complete, as they appear to be, the frond agrees very\r\nclosely with _Pterophyllum Carterianum_ Old. and Morr.[1749] from\r\nIndia. A comparison of the Rajmahal specimen with Halle’s figure\r\nleads me to regard the two fronds as probably identical. The veins in\r\nthe Indian species, which should also be referred to _Pseudoctenis_,\r\nare prominent and from ·5 to 1 mm. apart; the base of the lamina is\r\nslightly broadened and the veins curve downwards towards the rachis\r\nin the lower decurrent portion. The other Indian type, _Pterophyllum\r\nMorrisianum_[1750], with which Halle compares his species is, however,\r\nnot a _Pseudoctenis_ but should be included in _Nilssonia_ and is\r\nprobably identical with _Pterophyllum princeps_ Old. and Morr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudoctenis Lanei_ Thomas.\r\n\r\nThis species[1751], recently described from Middle Jurassic beds at\r\nMarske, Yorkshire, has narrower linear lanceolate pinnae. The linear\r\npinnae reach a length of 10 cm. and a breadth of 9 mm. The veins\r\nare numerous, 10 in a breadth of 6 mm., and only one cross-vein was\r\nnoticed. In the decurrent lower edge of the laminae the fronds are\r\nidentical with _Ctenis sulcicaulis_. A very good example of this\r\nspecies[1752] in the York Museum is reproduced by Mr Thomas in his\r\naccount of Cleveland Jurassic plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudoctenis Balli_ (Feistmantel).\r\n\r\nA species described originally by Feistmantel[1753] as _Anomozamites\r\nBalli_ from the Barakar group of the Damuda series and afterwards\r\ntransferred to the genus _Platypterygium_, characterised by broadly\r\nlinear segments of unequal breadth attached obliquely or at\r\nright-angles to a slender rachis. The apices of the segments though\r\nusually imperfect appear to be truncate; the bases of the pinnae\r\nare decurrent by their lower edge. The veins are approximately 3\r\nper millimetre; they are generally forked at the base and in one or\r\ntwo places show cross-connexions. In the middle of the frond the\r\nnarrow rachis is exposed but in the apical region it is covered by\r\nthe laminae. The occurrence of two divergent pinnae at the apex of\r\nthe frond is a feature met with also in _Ctenis sulcicaulis_. This\r\ndescription is based on an examination of the specimens figured by\r\nFeistmantel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. +Cycadean Fronds which cannot be assigned to a family-position.+\r\n\r\n=SPHENOZAMITES.= Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed by Brongniart[1754] as a subgenus of\r\n_Otozamites_ denoting pinnate fronds bearing leaflets without an\r\nauriculate base: he suggested that the subgenus might eventually be\r\nraised to generic rank and this was done by Zigno[1755] though in too\r\nwide a sense. In the case of _Otozamites Beani_ (Lind. and Hutt.),\r\nquoted by Brongniart in illustration of _Sphenozamites_, the latter\r\ndesignation is inapplicable as the pinnae are auriculate. Another\r\nspecies, _Zamites undulatus_ Sternb., to which Brongniart applied his\r\nnew subgeneric term, is probably identical with _Otozamites acuminatus_\r\n(L. and H.)[1756].\r\n\r\nAlthough the distinction between _Sphenozamites_ and _Otozamites_ is\r\noften ill defined the former name may be conveniently adopted for\r\npinnate fronds similar to those of _Zamia Skinneri_ and some species\r\nof _Encephalartos_ characterised by leaflets of an asymmetrical,\r\nobovate, or rhomboidal form with a contracted or cuneate base and\r\nnumerous branched divergent veins. Nothing is known of the structure or\r\nreproductive organs of _Sphenozamites_, and the genus, though serving\r\na useful descriptive purpose, is founded solely on form, and in the\r\nabsence of other data it would be rash to assume that its use implies\r\nclose natural affinity. In the case of many other genera of Cycadean\r\nfronds there is additional evidence of relationship, but this is not\r\nthe case with _Sphenozamites_. The pinnae resemble those of such recent\r\nCycadean fronds as _Zamia Skinneri_ and _Z. muricata_. The genus ranges\r\nfrom Lower Permian to Jurassic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sphenozamites Rochei_ Renault.\r\n\r\nThis species[1757], from the Lower Permian of the Autun district, is\r\nfounded on a pinnate frond bearing alternate pinnae, 2·5 × 1 cm., with\r\nan asymmetrical oblong lamina attached obliquely near the edge of\r\nthe rachis with a cuneate base slightly decurrent below and a broadly\r\nrounded apex; the veins dichotomise once or twice as they diverge\r\nfrom the narrow base (fig. 628). The pinnae resemble the leaflets of\r\n_Noeggerathia foliosa_ Sternb. and are similar in shape to those of the\r\nJurassic species _Sphenozamites Geylerianus_ Zig.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 628. _Sphenozamites Rochei._ (After Renault; nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 629. _Sphenozamites Belli._ (Oxford Museum; nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sphenozamites Belli_ Seward.\r\n\r\nThis Middle Jurassic species from Stonesfield[1758] is founded on\r\ndetached pinnae possibly identical with a specimen figured by Buckman\r\nas _?Naiadea obtusa_[1759]. The pinnae are wedge-shaped, tapering\r\ngradually to an acute apex and attached by a narrow base: the leaflet\r\nshown in fig. 629 is 9 cm. long; the veins are numerous and more\r\ndivergent than in some leaves of similar form referred to the genus\r\n_Podozamites_. With this species may be compared several Italian\r\nJurassic specimens described by Zigno[1760] as four distinct species\r\nbut more appropriately assigned to a single type _S. Geylerianus_.\r\nAn examination of Zigno’s fronds in the Padua Museum, which he named\r\n_S. Rossii_, leads me to regard the irregularly serrate edge of the\r\npinnae as the result of tearing of an originally entire lamina and\r\nto compare the specimens with _Otozamites Beani_ (L. and H.). An\r\nimperfect ovoid pinna recalling _S. Belli_ is figured by Newberry\r\nfrom the Rhaetic of Honduras as _Sphenozamites robustus_[1761]. A\r\nFrench Upper Jurassic species figured by Saporta as _Sphenozamites\r\nlatifolius_ bears a very close resemblance in the form of the leaflets\r\nto the Wealden plant _Sewardia latifolia_[1762]. Kurtz records the\r\noccurrence of _Sphenozamites_, _S. Geinitzianus_, from Rhaetic strata\r\nin Argentina[1763], but I have not seen any figures of this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PLAGIOZAMITES=. Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThe name _Plagiozamites_ was proposed by Zeiller[1764] for some pinnate\r\nfronds and detached leaflets from the Stephanian of Commentry and the\r\nLower Permian of the Vosges. The better preservation of the Vosges\r\nmaterial enabled him to recognise certain features which led to the\r\nsubstitution of _Plagiozamites_ for _Zamites_, the name originally\r\nemployed by Renault for the Commentry specimens. _Plagiozamites_ bears\r\na superficial resemblance to _Zamites_ and _Otozamites_ and differs\r\nbut little from _Sphenozamites_ and _Noeggerathia_; it stands for\r\npinnate fronds bearing ovate pinnae with a sub-amplexicaul oblique\r\nattachment to the rachis as is clearly shown in the species _P.\r\nPlanchardi_ (Ren.)[1765]. In the case of Palaeozoic fronds assigned to\r\nthe Cycadophyta on the ground of the resemblance of their pinnae to\r\nthose of undoubted Cycadean species, it is particularly important to\r\nrecognise the fact that decisive evidence as to systematic position is\r\nlacking. We know nothing of the stem, the reproductive organs, or the\r\nepidermal and stomatal characters of _Plagiozamites_, and it is by no\r\nmeans certain that the genus is a true representative of the group in\r\nwhich it is provisionally included.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plagiozamites Planchardi_ (Renault).\r\n\r\nFronds pinnate; pinnae ovate-lanceolate reaching 5 cm. in length and\r\n1·6 cm. in breadth, inserted obliquely on the rachis, but not along\r\na line parallel to the long axis of the rachis as in _Zamites_, and\r\npartially embracing it: the edge of the lamina is finely denticulate;\r\nveins slightly divergent and occasionally branched. The leaflets are\r\nnarrow and more acute than those of _Noeggerathia_ and _Sphenozamites\r\nRochei_ Ren. _Plagiozamites_ is recorded from the Stephanian of\r\nCommentry, the Coal Measures of Manchuria[1766], and the Lower Permian\r\nof the Vosges. Renault described six species of _Zamites_ from\r\nCommentry all, except _Z. carbonarius_, based on detached pinnae.\r\nThe type-specimen of _Z. carbonarius_ consists of a piece of stout\r\nrachis bearing ovate acute pinnae, 2·2 × 1 cm. Potonié[1767], who\r\nrefers a piece of pinnate frond from the Permian of Thuringia to\r\n_Z. carbonarius_, includes the other species of Renault under that\r\nname. Whether or not the differences in the venation and form of the\r\npinnae are of specific significance cannot be definitely settled\r\nwithout better material, but the important point is that these\r\nPermo-Carboniferous fronds are sufficiently distinct from _Zamites_\r\nto be placed in a separate genus. _Plagiozamites carbonarius_ is\r\nrecorded also by Zalessky[1768] from the Permian of Manchuria though\r\nthe examples figured do not afford satisfactory evidence of the\r\nmode of insertion of the segments on the rachis. _P. Planchardi_\r\nhas recently been recorded from the Coal Measures of Maryland; the\r\ndiscovery is interesting both on phytogeographical grounds and as\r\nthe first satisfactory record of a Palaeozoic Cycadophyte from North\r\nAmerica[1769].\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cycadorachis.= Saporta.\r\n\r\nThe employment of this generic name may serve a useful purpose if used\r\nfor specimens, whether preserved as petrifactions or impressions,\r\nbelieved to be portions of Cycadean frond-axes, but which in the\r\nabsence of pinnae cannot be assigned to one of the recognised genera\r\nof fronds. Saporta[1770] describes two species from Kimmeridgian beds\r\nin France, _Cycadorachis abscissa_ and _C. armata_: the first may be\r\nthe winged base of a Cycadean petiole, but it agrees equally well with\r\nthe broad base of an Osmundaceous leaf and should not be referred to\r\na genus implying affinity with a particular class. The other species,\r\n_C. armata_, is probably a piece of a spinous axis like that of the\r\nWealden plant _Sewardia latifolia_ (Sap.). A fragment figured by Fliche\r\nand Bleicher[1771] from the Jurassic of Nancy as _C. tuberculata_ is\r\nanother example of a fossil which cannot be referred with any certainty\r\nto the Cycads.\r\n\r\nDr Stopes[1772], inadvertently overlooking the previous institution\r\nof _Cycadorachis_, has recently proposed the name _Cycadeorachis_ for\r\npinnately branched rachises of Cycadean fronds which, ‘while indicating\r\nthe general character of the frond, do not show the shape of the pinnae\r\nwell enough to be associated with any of the many foliage-genera.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LIST OF WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT\r\n\r\n                        (+Volumes III. and IV.+)\r\n\r\n   [_With a few exceptions this list does not include books and papers\r\n           given in the Bibliographies in volumes I. and II._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the Bibliographies which students will\r\nfind useful for additional references:—Geological Literature added\r\nto the Geological Society’s Library, published from time to time\r\nby the Society; Prof. Zeiller’s lists in the ‘Revue Générale de\r\nBotanique’ (Paris); lists given by Arber in the ‘Progressus Rei\r\nBotanicae’ (Leiden), vol. +i.+ Heft i. p. 218, 1907; Jongman’s ‘Die\r\nPalaeobotanische Literatur’ (Jena), 1910–13; also the International\r\nCatalogue of Scientific Literature (Botany and Geology).

He finds that _Hierogramma_ and _Syncardia_ are probably\r\ndifferent states of the _petiole_ of _Cladoxylon_ and while agreeing\r\nwith Solms-Laubach’s conclusions he has been able to add important\r\nnew facts. Bertrand has now given up the opinion that _Clepsydropsis_\r\nis the petiole of _Cladoxylon_. For further details students should\r\nconsult the preliminary note which it is hoped will be followed by a\r\nfully illustrated memoir [Bertrand, P.

Gordon has kindly\r\nsupplied the following summary of his unpublished work on the genus\r\n_Pitys_.\r\n\r\n‘The re-examination of _Pitys primaeva_ and _P. antiqua_ in the light\r\nof the structure exhibited by numerous specimens of a new species\r\nrecently discovered in Haddingtonshire has shown that all three types\r\nare similar as regards the structure of the primary wood. In each\r\ncase the primary cylinder is comparable with that in _Archaeopitys\r\nEastmanii_ [see p. 290], _i.e._, there are medullary as well as\r\ncircummedullary xylem-strands. In certain specimens of the new species,\r\n_Pitys Dayii_, the bark and leaves are preserved and thus the details\r\nof leaf-trace emission from the stem have been determined. The leaves\r\nare short and stout and taper gradually to a point, quite distinct from\r\nthe long, thin, spatulate Cordaitean foliage. The internal structure of\r\nthe leaf renders it easily distinguishable from the _Cordaites_ type\r\nwhile it tends to accentuate the possible relationship of _Pitys_ with\r\nthe Lyginodendreae.’\r\n\r\n[765] Williamson (78) A. p. 352, Pl. +xxv.+ figs. 90–92; Williamson and\r\nScott (95) p. 770; Seward (97²) p. 80.\r\n\r\n[766] Witham (31) A.\r\n\r\n[767] Goeppert (50) p. 251; (81).\r\n\r\n[768] Brongniart (49) A. 77.\r\n\r\n[769] Scott (02) p. 354.\r\n\r\n[770] Scott and Jeffrey (14) p. 345, Pl. +xxxi.+ figs. 31–36;\r\ntext-figs. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n[771] Zalessky (09); (11) p. 29, Pl. +iv.+\r\n\r\n[772] Zalessky (11) Pl. +iv.+ fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[773] Scott (12) p. 1024.\r\n\r\n[774] Elkins and Wieland (14).\r\n\r\n[775] Penhallow (00) pp. 64, Pl. +xii.+\r\n\r\n[776] Zalessky (11²) p. 13, figs. 1–4.\r\n\r\n[777] See page 295.\r\n\r\n[778] Zalessky (11) p. 28.\r\n\r\n[779] Williamson (80) A. p. 516, Pl. +xx.+ fig. 60.\r\n\r\n[780] Scott (02) p. 357, Pls. +ii.+, +vi.+\r\n\r\n[781] Scott (12) p. 1028.\r\n\r\n[782] Goeppert (45²) p. 11, Pls. +xxix.–xxxv.+; Zalessky (11).\r\n\r\n[783] Goeppert and Stenzel (88) p. 33, Pls. +v.+, +vi.+\r\n\r\n[784] Kraus in Schimper (72) A. p. 381.\r\n\r\n[785] Seward (14) p. 17, Pls. +iv.–viii.+\r\n\r\n[786] Scott (12).\r\n\r\n[787] See page 175.\r\n\r\n[788] De Bary (84) A. p. 492; Grossenbacher (15).\r\n\r\n[789] See Scott, _Nature_, August 26, 1915.\r\n\r\n[790] See Vol. +ii.+ p. 56.\r\n\r\n[791] Oliver (06) p. 726.\r\n\r\n[792] Hooker and Binney (55).\r\n\r\n[793] Oliver (03).\r\n\r\n[794] Worsdell (05) p. 58; Salisbury (14) p. 67.\r\n\r\n[795] Brongniart (81) p. 31.\r\n\r\n[796] For an account of the work of this author see Lang in Oliver (13)\r\np. 178.\r\n\r\n[797] See Scott (09) B. p. 543.\r\n\r\n[798] Mirande (05).\r\n\r\n[799] For definition of _Cardiocarpus_, see page 338.\r\n\r\n[800] See page 25.\r\n\r\n[801] Solms-Laubach (91) A. p. 118.\r\n\r\n[802] Goeppert (65) p. 177, Pl. +xxvi.+ figs. 27, 28.\r\n\r\n[803] Williamson (77) B. p. 262.\r\n\r\n[804] Zeiller (88) A. p. 642.\r\n\r\n[805] Brongniart (74).\r\n\r\n[806] Brongniart (81).\r\n\r\n[807] Oliver (04) B. p. 389.\r\n\r\n[808] Affourtit and La Rivière (15).\r\n\r\n[809] Nathorst (14) p. 32.\r\n\r\n[810] See page 173.\r\n\r\n[811] Salisbury (14) p. 71.\r\n\r\n[812] Salisbury (14).\r\n\r\n[813] Oliver (04) B. p. 392.\r\n\r\n[814] Oliver (07).\r\n\r\n[815] Arber, A.

It is clearly\r\nin accordance with the Rules adopted by the International Botanical\r\nCongress and with general convenience to avoid the employment of the\r\nsame name for two different generic types even if one is known only\r\nin a fossil state. My attention has been called by Mr W. N. Edwards\r\nof the British Museum to the fact that the names _Platyspermum_,\r\n_Microspermum_, and _Pterospermum_ recently proposed by Dr Arber for\r\nPalaeozoic seeds have previously been given to recent flowering plants.\r\nThough I have often neglected to consult the _Index Kewensis_ and the\r\n_Genera Siphonogamarum_ before proposing a ‘new’ generic term, I fully\r\nrecognise the importance of avoiding the employment of names in current\r\nuse or names which have ‘lapsed into synonymy[966].’\r\n\r\n[957] See page 361.\r\n\r\n[958] Brongniart (74) p. 246; (81) p. 21, Pls. +ix.–xi.+\r\n\r\n[959] Bertrand, C.

He thinks that the genus is intermediate between _Anomozamites_\r\nand _Ctenopteris_; its systematic position has not been definitely\r\nestablished but, as Antevs says, there seems to be no reason why it\r\nshould not be a member of the Cycadophyta. In some species, _e.g._\r\n_Ptilozamites fallax_ Nath. and _P. Nilssoni_ Nath., the rachis is\r\nforked, while in _P. Heeri_ Nath. with linear fronds reaching a length\r\nof 53 cm. the rachis is undivided.\r\n\r\n[1443] Antevs (14²).\r\n\r\n[1444] See page 502.\r\n\r\n[1445] Nathorst (08) Pl. +i.+ figs. 3–5; Thomas and Bancroft (13) p.\r\n194, Pl. +xx.+ fig. 12.\r\n\r\n[1446] Fontaine (89) B. p. 160, Pls. +lxi.–lxvi.+; Berry (11) p. 354.\r\n\r\n[1447] Morris (40) Pl. +xxi.+ figs. 1–4.\r\n\r\n[1448] Lindley and Hutton (34) A.
