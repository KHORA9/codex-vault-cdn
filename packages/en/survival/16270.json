This is due to\r\nthe fact that the arrangement of the motors of this class that have\r\nhitherto been constructed has been such as to render them but slightly\r\npractical. In the Benier hot air engine (illustrated herewith),\r\nhowever, obstacles that were once considered insurmountable have been\r\novercome, and the motor presents many advantages over all the types\r\nthat have preceded it. Among such advantages we shall cite the\r\npossibility of utilizing air at a high temperature (1,200 or 1,500\r\ndegrees), while the rubbing surfaces remain at a moderate temperature\r\n(60 or 80 degrees). The fire grate is placed in the interior of the\r\ncylinder, and is traversed by the cold air forced by a pump. The\r\nexpanded hot gases fill the cylinder and act against the piston\r\ndirectly above the grate.\r\n\r\nThe type herewith illustrated is of 6 horse power. The motive\r\ncylinder, CC', is bolted to the extremity of the frame, A. Upon this\r\nlatter is fixed a column, B, which carries a working beam, E. This\r\nlatter transmits the motion of the piston, P, to the shaft, D. A pump,\r\nG, placed within the frame, forces a certain quantity of cold air at\r\nevery revolution into the driving cylinder. The piston of this pump is\r\nactuated by the connecting rod, G', jointed to the lever, F', which\r\nreceives its motion from the rod, F. A slide valve, _b'_, actuated by\r\na cam, regulates the entrance of the cold air into the pump during\r\nsuction, as well as its introduction into the cylinder. There is a\r\nthrust upon the piston during its upward travel, and an escape of hot\r\ngas through the eduction valve, _h_, during the downward travel.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is in two parts, C and C'. The piston, which is very\r\nlong, rubs at its upper end against the sides of the cylinder, C. The\r\nlower end is of smaller diameter, and leaves an annular space between\r\nit and the cylinder. The grate is at the bottom of the cylinder, C'.\r\nThe sides of the cylinder at the level of the fire box are protected\r\nwith a lining of plumbago. When the piston is at the bottom of its\r\ntravel, the eduction valve closes. The slide valve, _b'_, establishes\r\na communication between the pump chamber and the cylinder. The air\r\ncontained in the pump is already compressed in the latter to a\r\npressure of nearly a kilogramme at the moment of the communication.\r\nThis air enters the cylinder, and the communication between the latter\r\nand the pump continues until all the air is forced into the driving\r\ncylinder, the piston of the pump being at the bottom of its travel,\r\nand that of the cylinder about midway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENIER'S HOT AIR ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe air forced by the pump piston enters the cylinder through two\r\nconduits, one of which leads a portion of it toward the top of the\r\ncylinder, and the other toward the bottom. The lower conduit debouches\r\nunder the grate, and the air that passes through it traverses the fire\r\nbox, and the hot gas fills the cylinder. The conduit that runs to the\r\ntop debouches in the cylinder, C, at the lower limit of the surface\r\nrubbed by the piston. The air that traverses this conduit is\r\ndistributed through the annular space between the piston and cylinder.\r\nThe hot gas derived from combustion can therefore never introduce\r\nitself into this annular space, and consequently cannot come into\r\ncontact with the rubbing surfaces of the cylinder and piston.\r\n\r\nAs the quantity of air introduced at every stroke is constant, the\r\nwork developed at every stroke is varied by regulating the temperature\r\nof the gas that fills the cylinder. When the temperature falls, the\r\npressure, and consequently the work developed, diminishes. This result\r\nis obtained by varying the respective quantities of air that pass\r\nthrough the fire box and around the piston. In measure as less air\r\npasses through the fire box, the quantity that passes around the\r\npiston augments by just so much, and the pressure diminishes. A valve,\r\n_n'_, in the conduit that runs to the fire box is controlled by the\r\nregulator, L', in the interior of the column. When the work to be\r\ntransmitted diminishes, the regulator closes the valve more or less,\r\nand the work developed diminishes.\r\n\r\nThe coke is put by shovelfuls into a hopper, I. Four buckets mounted\r\nupon the periphery of a wheel, I', traverse the coke, and, taking up a\r\npiece of it, let it fall upon the cover, J, of the slide valve, _j_,\r\nwhence it falls into the cavity of the latter when it is uncovered,\r\nand from thence into the conduit, _c'_, of the box, _j'_, when the\r\ncavity of the valve is opposite the conduit. From the conduit, _c'_,\r\nthe coke falls upon the grate.\r\n\r\nA small sight hole covered with glass, in the cover, J, permits the\r\ngrate to be seen when the cavity of the valve is opposite _c'_.\r\n\r\nAs in gas engines, a current of water is made to flow around the\r\ncylinder, C', in order to keep the sides from getting too hot.\r\n\r\nIn order to set the engine in motion, we begin by opening the bottom,\r\nC, of the cylinder, C', to clean the grate. This done, we close C and\r\nintroduce lighted charcoal through the conduit, _c'_ (the valve being\r\nopen). The valve is put in place, two or three revolutions are given\r\nto the fly wheel, and the motor starts. The feeding is afterward done\r\nwith coke.\r\n\r\nThe parts that transmit motion operate under conditions analogous to\r\nthose under which the same parts of a steam engine do. The air pump\r\nsucks and forces nothing but cold air, and nothing but cold air passes\r\nthrough the distributing slide valve. The pump and valve are therefore\r\nrendered very durable. The piston and cylinder, at the points where\r\nfriction exists, are at a temperature of 60 or 80 degrees. These\r\nsurfaces are protected against hot gas charged with dust.\r\n\r\nThe hot gas, which escapes from the cylinder through a valve, has\r\npreviously been cooled by contact with the sides of the cylinder and\r\nby expansion. The eduction valve just mentioned works about like that\r\nof a steam engine, and it is only necessary to polish it now and then\r\nin order to keep it in good condition.--_Annales Industrielles._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR FUTURE PROBLEMS.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: An address to the graduating class, Stevens\r\n  Institute, Hoboken, N.J., 1887.]\r\n\r\nBy CHARLES E. EMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President and Ladies and Gentlemen:_ It has not been considered\r\nthe duty of the speaker, in addressing the graduating class, to dwell\r\non the triumphs of science or the advantage of a liberal education.\r\nThese subjects have already been discussed, in connection with the\r\nregular courses of study, better, and more at length, than he could\r\ndo. We propose rather to try and prepare the minds of the graduates\r\nfor the practical problems before them.\r\n\r\nAll young men are impressed with the consciousness of higher powers as\r\nthey increase their stores of knowledge, and this feeling perhaps\r\nreaches its maximum with those who have made a specialty of the\r\ninvestigation and application of physical laws. Young men who have\r\nlearned how to harness the powers of nature and guide them to do their\r\nwill are apt to belittle the difficulties they have yet to overcome,\r\nand have a false impression of the problems of life. This feeling is\r\nshown to a minimum extent by graduates of the Stevens Institute, on\r\naccount of their careful practical training, in connection with the\r\nthorough study of principles; but it has been thought best for one\r\nfrom the outside world to supplement such teaching by calling to mind\r\ninstances which may have a useful counteracting effect, and, like\r\nparables, serve the purpose of illustrative instruction.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Class of '87_: It was the pleasure of the speaker to\r\naddress the class of '79, under the title of \"How to Succeed,\" some\r\nwords of counsel and warning, which, if they left an impression of\r\nseverity at the time, were apparently so well received afterward that\r\nhe has been tempted to continue the general subject, with the title of\r\n\"Your Future Problems.\" The notation of your future problems will not\r\nbe found at once among the known quantities, but with _x_, _y_, and\r\n_z_, at the other end of the alphabet. Often word symbols will be\r\napplicable, expressing at times disappointment and pain, at other\r\ntimes renewed effort, and finally the active phases of individual\r\nthought and exertion.\r\n\r\nThe first serious problem with many of you will be to secure\r\nsatisfactory engagements. This problem cannot be illustrated by\r\nparables. It needs, in general, patient, unremitting, and frequently\r\nlong continued effort. It may be that the fame of some of you, that\r\nhave already acquired the happy faculty of making yourselves\r\nimmediately useful, has already gone abroad and the coveted positions\r\nbeen already assured. To be frank, we cannot promise you even a bed of\r\nroses. We have in mind an instance where a superior authority in a\r\nlarge business enterprise who had great respect, as he should have,\r\nfor the attainments of young gentlemen who have had the opportunities\r\nof a technical education, deliberately ordered out a competent\r\nmechanical engineer, familiar with the designs required in a large\r\nrepair shop, and sent in his place a young gentleman fresh from school\r\nand flushed with hope, but who from the very nature of the case could\r\nknow little or nothing of his duties at that particular place. He was\r\npractically alone in the drawing room, and did not know where to find\r\nsuch drawings as were required, and candor requires it to be said that\r\nhe desired to ask many questions about those he did find. The\r\nsuperintendent unfortunately had nothing to do with his appointment,\r\nand rather resented it. So he did not trust any of his work, and the\r\nnew comer was obliged to learn his practical experience at that\r\nestablishment, where he was known as the mechanical engineer, by\r\nhaving all his work done over by the pattern maker or others, under\r\nthe eye of the superintendent or master mechanic, and be subjected all\r\nthe time to the jealousies and annoyances incident to such a method of\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nHis practical experience was certainly learned under difficulties\r\nwhich I trust none of you may experience. This statement is made that\r\nthose of you who have not yet obtained positions may not envy those\r\nwho have, and that each and all of you may be careful not to take a\r\nposition so far above your experience, if not your capacity, as to\r\nbecome unpleasantly situated in the beginning. The educational\r\nfacilities you have enjoyed are of such great value in some\r\nexceptional cases that the parties thus benefited may do you an injury\r\nby leading others to expect that you will be equally valuable in\r\nperforming duties which require much more practical experience and\r\nknowledge of detail than it is possible that you could have obtained\r\nin the time you have been here.\r\n\r\nThe incident is ripe with suggestions. No matter how humble a position\r\nyou may take in the beginning, you will be embarrassed in much the\r\nsame way as the young gentleman in question, though it is hoped in a\r\nless degree. Your course of action should be first to learn to do as\r\nyou are told, no matter what you think of it. And above everything\r\nkeep your eyes and ears open to obtain practical knowledge of all that\r\nis going on about you. Let nothing escape you of an engineering\r\nnature, though it has connection with the business in hand. It may be\r\nyour business the next day, and if you have taken advantage of the\r\nvarious opportunities to know all about that particular matter in\r\nevery detail, you can intelligently act in relation to it, without\r\nembarrassment to yourself and with satisfaction to your superior.\r\n\r\nAbove all, avoid conflict with the practical force of the\r\nestablishment into which you are introduced. It is better, as we have\r\nat another time advised, to establish friendly relations with the\r\nworkmen and practical men with whom you have to do.\r\n\r\nYou are to be spared this evening any direct references to the\r\n\"conceit of learning,\" but you are asked and advised to bear with the\r\n_conceit of ignorance_. You will find that practical men will be\r\njealous of you on account of your opportunities, and at the same time\r\njealous of their own practical information and experience, and that\r\nthey may take some pains to hinder rather than aid you in your\r\nattempts to actively learn the practical details of the business. The\r\nmost disagreeable man about the establishment to persons like you, who\r\nperhaps goes out of his way to insult you, and yet should be respected\r\nfor his age, may be one who can be of greatest use to you. Cultivate\r\nhis acquaintance. A kind word will generally be the best response to\r\nan offensive remark, though gentlemanly words of resentment may be\r\nnecessary when others are present. Sometimes it will be sufficient to\r\nsay, \"I wish a little talk with you by yourself,\" which will put the\r\nbystanders at a distance and enable you to mature your plans.\r\nAscertain as soon as possible that man's tastes; what he reads and\r\nwhat he delights in. Approach him as if you had no resentment and talk\r\non his favorite topic. If rebuffed, tell a pleasant story, and persist\r\nfrom time to time in the attempt to please, until his hardened nature\r\nrelaxes and he begins to feel and perhaps speaks to others favorably\r\nof you. St. Paul has said: \"For though I be free from all men, yet\r\nhave I made myself servant of all that I might gain the more.\" This is\r\nthe keynote of policy, and though in humbling yourself you control and\r\nhide your true feelings, recollect that all your faculties are given\r\nyou for proper use.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to some who have acquired the happy faculty of making\r\nthemselves immediately useful. This is a much more difficult matter\r\nthan the words imply. If one of you should be so fortunate as to be\r\nordered to make certain tests almost like those you have already\r\nconducted here, or to tabulate the results of tests as you have done\r\nit here, or to make inspections akin to those which have been fully\r\nexplained here, there is every probability the work would be done\r\nsatisfactorily in the first instance. But let a much _simpler_ case\r\narise, for instance, if a superior hand one of you a letter with the\r\nsimple instructions, \"Get me the facts on that,\" you may be very much\r\npuzzled to know what is to be done and how to do it. It may be that\r\nthe letter is a request for information in regard to certain work that\r\nwas carried on in the past, in which case it will be necessary for you\r\nto hunt through old records, copy books, engineering notes, drawings,\r\nand the like, and get a list of all referring to the subject; to make\r\nan abstract of the letters and notes if they are at all complicated;\r\nand finally to lay the whole before the overworked superior in a\r\nbusiness manner, that he largely from recollection, aided by the\r\nreferences and notes, can write an intelligent answer in a very brief\r\nperiod. The way not to do it would be to say, \"Yes, sir,\" very\r\npromptly, go off and not more than half read the letter, do something\r\nand be back in five minutes with some question or ill-digested answer;\r\nthen upon receiving a polite hint as to the method to be employed, go\r\noff and repeat the operation the next five minutes; then on receiving\r\na short reply, in what appeared to be an unnecessary tone of voice,\r\nget a little flurried perhaps, do worse next time, and in the end feel\r\nvery unpleasant without having accomplished much, and make the\r\ngentleman seeking assistance lament the difficulty in teaching young\r\nmen practical work.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, on the contrary, for a young man to exceed his\r\ninstructions and volunteer advice that has not been asked. If he has\r\nunfortunately gone too far for some time and been sharply spoken to,\r\nhe may fail the next in not fully doing the work intended. Simply\r\nputting down a column of figures would not necessarily mean tabulating\r\nfacts. The arrangement and rearrangement of the columns aid in\r\nclassifying such facts, so that the results shown by them will be\r\nreadily seen and a great deal of labor saved in examination. A good\r\nrule in a case of this kind is to try and find some work done by other\r\nparties of a similar nature, and thereby ascertain what is needed and\r\nexpected. Reasonable questions to ascertain, where records are to be\r\nfound and the kind of records accessible, are always proper if made at\r\nthe proper time without interrupting an immediate train of thought;\r\nand with such information as a start, if a young man will endeavor to\r\nimagine himself in a place like that of the one who has finally to\r\ndecide, and try to ascertain just what information will probably be\r\nrequired, then patiently go to work to find and present it in\r\ncondensed shape, he from that moment really begins to be useful and\r\nhis services will be rapidly appreciated. It is a good rule always to\r\nkeep the memoranda obtained in accomplishing a result of this kind; so\r\nthat if further information is required, the whole investigation need\r\nnot be made over.\r\n\r\nThis remark suggests another line of thought. Some young men with\r\nquick perceptions get in the way at school of trusting their memories,\r\nand omit making complete notes of lectures or of the various tests\r\nillustrating their studies. This carelessness follows them into after\r\nlife, and there are instances where young men, who can make certain\r\nkinds of investigations much better than their fellows, and promptly\r\ngive a statement of the general nature of the results, have, when\r\ncalled on afterward for the details, forgotten then entirely, and\r\ntheir notes and memoranda, if preserved, being of little use, the\r\nlabor is entirely lost. Such men necessarily have to learn more\r\ncareful ways in after life. It is a good rule in this, as in the\r\nprevious case, to make and copy complete records of everything in such\r\nshape that they may be convenient for reference and criticism\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nOne of the important problems with which you will have to deal in the\r\nfuture is the labor question, and it is probable that your very first\r\nexperience with it may be in direct antagonism with the opinions of\r\nmany with whom you have heretofore been associated. It is an honor to\r\nthe feelings of those who stand outside and witness this so-called\r\nstruggle now in progress between capital and labor, that they believe\r\nthe whole question can be settled by kindly treatment and reasonable\r\nargument. There are some cases that will yield to such treatment, and\r\none's whole duty is not performed till all possible, reasonable, and\r\nhumanitarian methods are adopted. There has been an excuse for the\r\norganization of labor, and it, to some small extent, still exists.\r\n\r\nTime was that the surplus of unskilled labor was used on a mercantile\r\nbasis to reduce wages to such an extent that it was almost impossible\r\nto rear a well nurtured, much less a well educated and well dressed\r\nfamily, and, moreover, the hours of labor in some branches of business\r\nwere so long as to shorten the lives of operatives and make\r\nself-improvement impossible. The natural progress of civilizing\r\ninfluence did much to abate many of these evils, but the organization\r\nof labor removed sores that had not and perhaps could not have been\r\nreached in other ways. Having then an excuse for organization, and\r\nsupported by the success made in directions where public sympathy was\r\nwith them, is it to be wondered that they have gone too far in very\r\nmany cases, and that the leadership of such organization has in many\r\ninstances been captured by designing men, who control the masses to\r\naccomplish selfish ends? Whatever may have been the method of\r\nevolution, it is certain that the manufacturing operations of the\r\npresent day have to meet with elements entirely antagonistic to their\r\ninterests, and in very many ways antagonistic to the interests of the\r\nworkingman. The members of many organizations, even of intelligent\r\nmen, are blindly led by chiefs of various titles, of which perhaps the\r\nwalking delegate is the most offensive one to reasonable people. This\r\nclass of men claim the right to intrude themselves into the\r\nestablishments owned by others, and on the most trivial grounds make\r\ndemands more or less unreasonable, and order strikes and otherwise\r\ninterfere with the work of manufacturers, much in the way that we have\r\nan idea that the agents of the barbarbous chieftains, feudal lords,\r\nand semi-civilized rulers collected taxes and laid burdens in earlier\r\nhistorical times. Necessarily these men must use their power so as to\r\ninsure its permanency. If strikes are popular, strikes must be\r\nordered. If funds run low, excuses for strikes, it is believed, in\r\nmany cases are sought, so as to stir the pulses of those who\r\nsympathize with the labor cause.\r\n\r\nCo-operation has been suggested as a cure for the evil, and there are\r\ncases where it has apparently succeeded, in connection with the\r\nearlier forms of labor organization. The ambition of later labor\r\nleaders almost prevents this remedy being of effect. It may be\r\npossible still with very intelligent workmen, isolated from the large\r\nmass of workmen in the country towns, to feel an interest in\r\nco-operation; but such inducements, or the higher ones of personal\r\nkindness to employes or their families, are not of much effect in\r\nlarge manufacturing centers. As soon as dissatisfaction exists in one\r\nmill or manufactory, all similar employes are ordered out. The final\r\nresult will be that combinations of employers must follow the\r\ncombination of employes, and those who have always been strong in the\r\npast will be stronger in the future, as has appeared to be the case in\r\nmany contests that have already taken place. If there are any real\r\nabuses of power by the employers, such as requiring work for unusual\r\nhours or at less than living rates, the first thing to do is to\r\ncorrect these abuses, so that complaints will not be upon a sound\r\nfoundation. Some men, when the labor epidemic strikes their places,\r\nhave sufficient force of character and influence with their men to\r\navert the blow for some time. Others find it is policy to compromise\r\nwith the representatives until a plan of action, conciliatory,\r\noffensive, or defensive, can be determined upon. The whole matter must\r\nbe considered one of policy rather than of principles. The class of\r\nmen to be dealt with do not talk principles except as an excuse to\r\nsecure their ends.\r\n\r\nIn spite of everything, there will be times when no compromise is\r\npossible and you will be called upon to take part in defending your\r\nemployers' interests against what is called a \"strike.\" You can do so\r\nwith heart when you know the employes are all well paid, and\r\nparticularly, as is frequently the case, when the labor organizers and\r\nwalking delegates claim that some old, tried foreman shall be\r\ndismissed because they do like him, really because he has not been a\r\ntool in carrying out their plans, and they defiantly acknowledge that\r\ntheir war is against non-union labor, and that they have organized\r\nyour men and forced a strike to require your establishment to become\r\nas it is called a \"union shop.\" If your deluded employes were\r\npermitted simply to go away and let you alone, and you were permitted\r\nto employ others at the reasonable wages you were paying, the problem\r\nwould be a simple one. The principal labor organizations claim that\r\neverything they do is by peaceable methods, but this, like many things\r\nsaid, is simply to deceive, for if you attempt to employ other\r\nassistants and carry on your business independently, you will surely\r\nfind that well known roughs are assembled who never do anything\r\nwithout they are paid for it by somebody, that your men are assaulted\r\nby such persons, and while the labor organizers talk about peaceable\r\nmethods and urge them aloud in public, in case one of the roughs is\r\narrested, the loud talkers are the first to go bail for the defender,\r\nand you will feel morally sure that the sympathizing crowd with the\r\nroughs who make the assaults are all part of or tools of the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nAt such times, you will find your old employes standing around the\r\nstreet corners, persuading other men not to go to work and thus\r\ninterfere with what are called the true interests of labor. Any new\r\nemploye who has to go in the street will be first met with inducements\r\nof other employment, with offers of money, afterward with threats,\r\nand, if opportunity occurs, with direct assault. All the features of\r\npersuasion, intimidation, and violence will be carried out as\r\ndemanded, and strangers to everybody in the vicinity, but well known\r\nas experienced leaders in this kind of work in other places, be\r\nbrought in to endeavor to make the strike a success. Then, young men,\r\nis the time to show your pluck, and our experience is that educated\r\nyoung men will do so every time. They can be depended upon to go\r\nstraight ahead with duty through every danger, bearing patiently\r\neverything that may be said, defending themselves with nature's\r\nweapons as long as possible, and without fear using reserve weapons in\r\ncase real danger of life is imminent.\r\n\r\nIn carrying through a very important strike against a mere desire to\r\ncontrol and not to correct abuses, your speaker desires to pay the\r\nhighest tribute to a number of educated young men, mostly from the\r\ntechnical schools, who fearlessly faced every danger, and by their\r\nexample stimulated others to do their duty, and all participated in\r\nthe results obtained by a great success.\r\n\r\nWe would not by such references fire your hearts to a desire to\r\nparticipate in such an unpleasant contest. It is the duty of all to\r\nstudy this problem intelligently and earnestly, with a view of\r\novercoming the difficulties and permitting the prosperity of the\r\ncountry to go on. While conciliation may be best at some times, policy\r\nat another, and resistance at another, we must also be thinking of the\r\nbest means to prevent further outbreaks. It would seem to be true\r\npolicy not to interfere with organization, but to try and direct it\r\ninto higher channels. Those of the humanitarians who claim that the\r\ndisease will be rooted out eventually by a more general and better\r\neducation are undoubtedly largely in the right, notwithstanding that\r\nsome fairly educated men have acted against their best interests in\r\naffiliating with the labor organizations. It seems to the speaker that\r\nenough instances can be collected to show the utter folly of the\r\npresent selfish system, based, as it is, entirely on getting all that\r\nis possible, independent of right in the matter, and by demanding\r\nequal wages for all men, tending to lower all to one common\r\ndegradation, instead of rewarding industry and ability and advancing\r\nthe cause of civilization.\r\n\r\nLabor should not be organized for selfish ends, but for its own good,\r\n_so as to secure steady and permanent employment_, rather than prevent\r\nit by impracticable schemes and unwise methods, which will cripple\r\nmanufacturers and all kinds of industry. The men should organize under\r\nthe general laws of the State, so that their leaders will be\r\nresponsible to the laws and can be indicted, tried, and punished in\r\ncase they misappropriate funds or commit any breach of trust; and such\r\nlaws should be amended if necessary, so that wise, responsible leaders\r\nof the organizations can contract to furnish labor for a certain time\r\nat a fixed price, when manufacturers can make calculations ahead as to\r\nthe cost of labor the same as for the cost of material, and have such\r\nconfidence that they will use all their energies to do a larger amount\r\nof business and benefit the workingman as well as themselves by\r\nfurnishing steady employment. Such a plan as is here outlined can\r\nreadily be carried into effect by selecting better men as leaders. It\r\nis well known how well the organization known as the locomotive\r\nbrotherhood is conducted, and it should be an example to others. It\r\nhas had its day of dissensions, when the best counsels did not\r\nprevail, which shows that any organization of the kind, no matter how\r\nwell conducted, may be diverted by its leaders into improper channels.\r\n\r\nWhen organized under the laws of the State and under by-laws designed\r\nto secure steady employment, rather than any artificial condition of\r\nthings in regard to pay hours, and continuance of labor, the true\r\ninterests of the workman will be advanced. It may be that some one of\r\nyou will develop a talent in the direction of organization and be the\r\nmeans of aiding in the solution of this great problem. Please think of\r\nthe matter seriously, watch the law of evolution while you are\r\nadvancing your professional knowledge, and if the opportunity offers,\r\ndo all you can to aid in a cause so important and beneficent.\r\n\r\nOne writer has criticised the technical schools because they do not\r\nteach mechanical intuition. The schools have enough to do in the time\r\navailable if they teach principles and sufficient practice to enable\r\nthe principles to be understood. The aptitude to design, which must be\r\nwhat is meant by mechanical intuition, requires very considerable\r\npractical experience, which you will readily learn if you do not keep\r\nyourself above it. If you have used your leisure hours to study why a\r\ncertain piece of mechanism was made in a certain way rather than in\r\nanother; if you have wondered why one part is thick in one place\r\nrather than in another, apparently in defiance of all rules of the\r\nstrength of material; if you have endeavored to ascertain why a\r\nparticular device is used rather than another more evident one; if you\r\nhave thought and studied why a boss is thrown in here and there in\r\ndesigns to receive bolts or to lengthen a journal, and if you have in\r\nyour mind, by repeated observation, a fair idea of how work is\r\ndesigned by other people, the so-called _mechanical intuition_ will be\r\nlearned and found to be the _combination of common sense and good\r\npractice_.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that some details have been copied for years and\r\nyears, although thoughtful men would say they are not the best, simply\r\nbecause they are adapted to a large amount of work already done. This\r\nis particularly true of the rolling stock on railroads. The cost of a\r\nchange in starting in a new country might be warranted, but it\r\npractically cannot be done when the parts must interchange with so\r\nmuch work done in other parts of the country. You will find in other\r\ncases that the direct strain to which a piece of mechanism is\r\nsubjected is only one of the strains which occur in practice. A piece\r\nof metal may have been thickened where it customarily broke, and you\r\nmay possibly surmise that certain jars took place that caused such\r\nbreakages, or that particular point was where the abuse of the\r\nattendant was customarily applied.\r\n\r\nWherever you go you will find matters of this kind affecting designs\r\nstaring you in the face, and you will soon see why a man who has\r\nlearned his trade in the shop, and from there worked into the drawing\r\nroom with much less technical information than you have, can get along\r\nas well as he does. Reserve your strength, however. Your time will\r\ncome. Whenever there is a new departure to be taken, and matters to be\r\nworked out from the solid which require close computation of strains\r\nor the application of any principles, your education will put you far\r\nahead, and if you have, during the period of what may be called your\r\npost-graduate course, which occurs during your early introduction into\r\npractical life, been careful to keep your eyes and ears open so as to\r\nlearn all that a man in practical life has done, you will soon stand\r\nfar ahead.\r\n\r\nReference was made to the use of leisure hours. Leisure hours can be\r\nspent in various ways. For instance, in studying the composition and\r\nresolution of forces and the laws of elasticity in a billiard room,\r\nthe poetry of motion, etc., in a ball room, and the chemical\r\nproperties of various malt and vinous extracts in another room; but\r\nthe philosophical reason why certain engineering work is done in the\r\nway it is, and the proper way in which new work shall be done of a\r\nsimilar character and original work of any kind carried on, can only\r\nbe learned by cultivating your powers of observation and ruminating on\r\nthe facts collected in the privacy of one's own room, away from the\r\nallurements provided for those who have nothing to do. No one would\r\nrecommend you to so separate yourself from the world as to sacrifice\r\nhealth and strength, or to become a recluse, even if you did learn all\r\nabout a certain thing.\r\n\r\nRemember, however, that the men who have accomplished most in this\r\nworld worked the longest hours, and any one with a regular occupation\r\nmust utilize his leisure hours to obtain prestige. The difference\r\nbetween one man and another of the same natural ability lies entirely\r\nin the amount of his information and the facility with which he can\r\nuse it. Life is short, and you must realize that now is your\r\nopportunity. If any diversion in the way of pleasure or even certain\r\nkinds of congenial work is offered, consider it in connection with the\r\nquestion, \"Will this be conducive to my higher aim?\" This implies that\r\nyou have a higher aim; and if you have it, and weigh everything in\r\nthis way, you will find that every moment of exertion adds something\r\nto your storehouse of information and brings you nearer to the\r\naccomplishment of that higher aim.\r\n\r\nIn closing, we thank the ladies and gentlemen present for their close\r\nattention to details of special interest only to those engaged in\r\ntechnical study or practice.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate you, young gentlemen of the class of '87, for the\r\nsuccess you have thus far obtained, and trust that you will persevere\r\nin well doing and win greater success in the future.

It was a question of testing a new\r\nvaporizer or burner for liquid fuel. The experiment was a repetition\r\nof the one that the inventor, Mr. G. Dietrich, recently performed with\r\nsuccess in the presence of Admirals Cloue and Miot.\r\n\r\nThe Flamboyante is 58 ft. in length, 9 ft. in width, draws 5 ft. of\r\nwater, and has a displacement of 10 tons. She is provided with a\r\ndouble vertical engine supplied by a Belleville boiler that develops\r\n28 horse power. The screw makes 200 revolutions per minute, and gives\r\nthe yacht a speed of 6½ knots.\r\n\r\nMr. Dietrich's vaporizer appears to be very simple, and has given so\r\ngood results that we have thought it of interest to give our readers a\r\nsuccinct description of it. In this apparatus, the inventor has\r\nendeavored to obtain an easy regulation of the two essential\r\nelements--naphtha and steam.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the apparatus in section. The steam enters through\r\nthe tubulure, A, and finds its way around the periphery of a tuyere,\r\nD. It escapes with great velocity, carries along the petroleum that\r\nruns from two lateral tubulures, B (Fig. 2), and throws it in a fine\r\nspray into the fireplace, through the nozzle, C (Fig. 1), which is\r\nflattened into the shape of a fan opened out horizontally. The mixture\r\nat once ignites in contact with the hot gases, and gives a beautiful,\r\nlong, clear flame. The air necessary for the combustion is sucked\r\nthrough the interior of the nozzle, H, which is in front of the\r\ntuyere. It will be seen that the current of steam can be regulated by\r\nmoving the tuyere, D, from or toward the eduction orifice. This is\r\neffected through a maneuver of the hand wheel, F. In the second place,\r\nthe flow of the petroleum is made regular by revolving the hand wheel,\r\nG, which gives the piston, O, a to and fro motion in the tuyere, D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--THE DIETRICH PETROLEUM BURNER.]\r\n\r\nThe regulation may be performed with the greatest ease. It is possible\r\nto instantly vary, together or separately, the steam and the\r\npetroleum. Under such circumstances, choking is not to be feared at\r\nthe petroleum orifice, where, according to experiment, the thickness\r\nof the substance to be vaporized should not be less than 0.04 of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum might evidently be made to enter at A and the steam at\r\nB; but one of the conclusions of the experiments cited is that the\r\nperformance is better when the jet of steam surrounds the petroleum.\r\nIt will be understood, in fact, that by this means not a particle of\r\nthe liquid can escape vaporization and, consequently, combustion.\r\nMoreover, as the jet of petroleum is completely surrounded by steam\r\nits flow can be increased within the widest limits, and this, in\r\ncertain cases, may prevent an obstruction without much diminishing the\r\nuseful effect of the burner.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is easily and rapidly taken apart. It it is only\r\nnecessary to remove the nozzle, C, in order to partially clean it. It\r\nwould even seem that the cleaning might be done automatically by\r\noccasionally reversing the flow of the steam and petroleum. However\r\nefficacious such a method might prove, the apparatus as we have\r\ndescribed it can be very easily applied to any generator. Fig. 2\r\nrepresents it as applied to the front of a furnace provided with two\r\ndoors. A metallic box, with two compartments, is placed on one side of\r\nthe furnace, and is provided with two stuffing boxes that are capable\r\nof revolving around the steam and petroleum pipes. The latter thus\r\nform the pivots of the hinge that allows of the play of the vaporizers\r\nand piping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--THE BURNER APPLIED TO THE FURNACE OF A BOILER.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Mr. Dietrich arranged his apparatus in an\r\nexperiment made upon a stationary boiler belonging to a Mr. Corpet.\r\nThe experiment was satisfactory and led to the adoption of the\r\narrangement shown in Fig. 3. The fire bridge is constructed of\r\nrefractory bricks, and the majority of the grate bars are filled in\r\nwith brick. The few free bars permit of the firing of the boiler and\r\nof access of air to the interior of the fire box. Under such\r\ncircumstances, the combustion is very regular, the furnace does not\r\nroar, and the smoke-consuming qualities are perfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--APPLICATION OF THE BURNER TO A RETURN FLAME\r\nBOILER.]\r\n\r\nIn the experiment on the Flamboyante, the boiler was provided with but\r\none apparatus, and the grate remained covered with a layer of ignited\r\ncoal that had been used for firing up in order to obtain the necessary\r\npressure of steam to set the vaporizer in operation. This ignited coal\r\nappeared to very advantageously replace the refractory bricks, the\r\nrole of which it exactly fulfilled. It has been found well, moreover,\r\nto break the flames by a few piles of bricks in the furnace, in order\r\nto obtain as intimate a mixture as possible of the inflammable gases.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that firing up in order to obtain the necessary\r\nsteam at first is a drawback that might be surmounted by using at the\r\nbeginning of the operation a very small auxiliary boiler. The main\r\nfurnace would then be fired by means of say a wad of cotton. But, in\r\ncurrent practice, if a grate and fire be retained, the firing will\r\nperhaps be simpler.\r\n\r\nWith but one apparatus, the pressure in the Flamboyante's boiler rose\r\nin a few minutes from 6 to 25 pounds, and about a quarter of an hour\r\nafter leaving the wharf the apparatus had been so regulated that there\r\nwas no sign of smoke. This property of the Dietrich burner proceeds\r\nnaturally from the use of a jet of steam to carry along the petroleum\r\nand air necessary for combustion. It is, in fact, an Orvis smoke\r\nconsumer transformed, and applied in a special way.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that the regulating requires a certain amount of\r\npractice and even a certain amount of time at every change in the\r\nboat's running. So it is well to use two, and even three, apparatus,\r\nof a size adapted to that of the boiler. The regulation of the furnace\r\ntemperature is then effected by extinguishing one or two, or even\r\nthree, of the apparatus, according as it is desired to slow up more or\r\nless or to come to a standstill.\r\n\r\nThe oil used by Mr. De Dosme on his yacht comes from Comaille, near\r\nAntun. The price of it is quite low, and, seeing the feeble\r\nconsumption (from 33 to 45 lb. for the yacht's boiler), it competes\r\nadvantageously with the coal that Mr. De Dosme was formerly obliged to\r\nuse.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 622, page 9935.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE OF GAUGE OF SOUTHERN RAILROADS IN 1886.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: A paper read before the Western Society of Engineers,\r\n  June 7, 1887.]\r\n\r\nBy C.H. HUDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the wheels that were still in use with the long hub were put\r\ninto a lathe, and a groove was cut an inch and a half back from the\r\nface, leaving our cast collar, which was easily split off as before.\r\n(Fig. 24.)\r\n\r\nWith tender wheels, as with our car wheels, the case was different.\r\nOriginally, the axle for the 5 ft. gauge was longer than for the 4 ft.\r\n9 in.; but latterly the 5 ft. roads had used a great many master car\r\nbuilders' axles for the 4 ft. 9 in. gauge, namely, 6 ft. 11¼ in. over\r\nall, thus making the width of the truck the same as for 4 ft. 9 in.\r\ngauge. To do this a dished wheel, or rather a wheel with a greater\r\ndish by 1½ in. than previously used, was needed, so that the tread of\r\nthe wheel could be at its proper place. (See Fig. 25.) There were, of\r\ncourse, many of the wheels with small dish and long axles still in\r\nuse. Their treatment, however, when the day of change came, did not\r\nvary from that of the short axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24 and FIG. 25]\r\n\r\nIt had been the rule for some years that all axles should be turned\r\nback 1½ in. further than needed; but unfortunately the rule had not\r\nbeen closely followed, and many were found not to be so turned. To\r\nmake the matter worse, quite a number of the wheels were found to have\r\nbeen counterbored about ½ in. deep at the back end, and the axle\r\nturned up to fit this counterbore; a good idea to prevent the running\r\nin, in case the wheel worked loose, but bad from the standpoint of a\r\nchange of gauge. In such cases the wheels had to be started off before\r\nthe axle could be turned back, so that the wheels could be pushed on\r\nin their proper position. (Fig. 26.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26]\r\n\r\nIf the work was done where they had a lathe large enough to swing a\r\npair of wheels, they were pressed off but half an inch, the wheels\r\nswung in the lathe, the axles turned back 1½ in., and the wheels then\r\npressed on 2 in. or 1½ in. inside of their first position.\r\n\r\nWhere no large lathe was in use, the wheels came entirely off before\r\nthe axles could be turned back. The work in the former case was both\r\nthe quicker and the cheaper. Where the large lathes were used they\r\nwere either set down into the floor, so a pair of wheels would easily\r\nroll into place, or a raised platform was put before the lathe, with\r\nan incline up which the wheels were rolled and then taken to the\r\nlathe. These arrangements were found much quicker and cheaper than to\r\nhoist the wheels up, as is usually done.\r\n\r\nIn pressing the wheels on, where the axles had previously been turned\r\nback, much trouble was at first experienced because of the rust that\r\nhad gathered upon the turned part behind the wheel, forming a ridge\r\nover or upon which the wheel must be pushed. Some of the roads, at the\r\nstart, burst 10 or 15 per cent. of the wheels so pressed on. By\r\nsaturating this surface with coal oil, however, it was found that the\r\nrust was easily removed and little trouble was had. It was found,\r\nsometimes, that upon axles newly turned back a careless workman would\r\nleave a ridge at the starting point of the turning. Frequently also\r\nthe axles were a little sprung, so that the new turning would be a\r\nlittle scant upon one side when compared with the old surface, and\r\nupon the opposite side a little full. As an indication that these\r\ndifficulties were overcome as they appeared, I will say that upon our\r\nline only 202 wheels burst out of nearly 27,000 pressed on--an\r\nexceedingly small percentage.\r\n\r\nAfter the change upon the early roads they were troubled for weeks\r\nwith hot boxes, caused, as we believed, by the changing of brasses. A\r\nbrass once fitted to a journal will work upon it without trouble, but\r\nwhen placed upon some other journal will probably not fit. If the\r\njournal had been worn hollow (and it was surprising to see how many\r\nwere so worn), the brass would be found worn down to fit it. (See Fig.\r\n27. Exaggerated, of course.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27 and FIG. 28]\r\n\r\nThe next wheel may have an axle worn little or none. (See Fig. 28)\r\n\r\nNow, if these brasses are exchanged, we have the conditions as shown\r\nin Figs. 29 and 30, and we must expect they will heat. The remedy was\r\nsimply to keep each brass upon its own journal. To do this the brasses\r\nwere fastened to the axle by a piece of small wire, and went with it\r\nto the lathe and press. When its truck was reached, the brass was\r\nthere with its journal. Worn-out brasses, of course, could not be put\r\nin, and new ones were substituted. The little trouble from that source\r\nthat followed the change showed the efficacy of the remedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29 and FIG. 30]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the tires of engines were to be changed, when the\r\nfinal day came, was a serious question. The old-fashioned fire upon\r\nthe ground could not be thought of. The M. & O. had used a fire of\r\npine under the wheel, which was covered by a box of sheet iron, so\r\narranged that the flame and heat would be conveyed around the tire,\r\nand out at an aperture at the top. (Fig. 31.) Many thought this\r\nperfect, while others were not satisfied, and began experiments for\r\nsomething better. A device for using gas had been patented, but it was\r\nsomewhat complicated, as well as expensive, and did not meet with\r\ngeneral favor. A very simple device was soon hit upon. A two inch pipe\r\nwas bent around in a circle a little larger than the outer rim of the\r\nwheel. Holes 1/10 in. in diameter and 3 or 4 in. apart were drilled\r\nthrough the pipe on the inside of the circle. To this pipe was\r\nfastened another with a branch or fork upon it. To one branch or fork\r\nwas connected a gas pipe from the meter, while to the other was\r\nconnected a pipe from an air pump. With the ordinary pressure of city\r\ngas upon this pipe it was found that the air pump must keep an air\r\npressure of 40 pounds, that the air and gas might mix properly at the\r\nbranch or fork, so we could get the best combustion and most heat from\r\nour \"blowpipe,\" for such it was. (Fig. 32.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31 and FIG. 32]\r\n\r\nWe were able to heat a tire so it could be moved in ten to twenty\r\nminutes, and the machine may be said to have been satisfactory.\r\n\r\nGas, however, was not to be had at all places where it would be\r\nnecessary to change tires, and the item of cost was considerable.\r\n\r\nTo reach a result as good, if possible, experiments were begun with\r\ncoal oil (headlight oil). They were crude and unsatisfactory at first,\r\nbut soon success was reached.\r\n\r\nA pipe was bent to fit the lower half of a wheel pretty closely and\r\nthen turned back under itself about the diameter of the pipe distant\r\nfrom it. This under part had holes 1/10 in. diameter and 3 or 4 in.\r\napart drilled upon its upper side or under the upper pipe. Connected\r\nwith the upper pipe at its center was a pipe which ran to one side and\r\nup to the can containing the kerosene. Between the can and the pipe\r\nunder the wheel was a stop cock, by which the flow of oil could be\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33]\r\n\r\nTo use the device, open the cock and let a small amount of oil flow;\r\napply fire to the pipe under the wheel, and the oil in the upper pipe\r\nis converted into gas, which flows out of the small holes in the lower\r\npipe, takes fire, and heats not only the tire, but the upper pipe,\r\nthus converting more oil into gas. We had here a lot of blue flame\r\njets and the same result as with gas, but at less cost. We had also a\r\nmachine that was inexpensive and easily handled anywhere. Boxes were\r\nplaced over the upper parts of the wheels, that the heat might pass\r\nclosely to the tire. This device was extensively used by our people,\r\nand with great satisfaction. In one way care had to be taken, viz.:\r\nThat in starting the fire it did not smoke and cover the tire with\r\ncarbon or \"lampblack,\" which is a non-conductor of heat.\r\n\r\nExperiments were made with air forced through gasoline, and with oil\r\nheated in a can to form gas. There was more danger in either of these\r\nthan with our blowpipe device, and no better results were obtained,\r\nthough the cost was greater.\r\n\r\nWith the change of the wheels, the brakes had to be changed the same\r\namount, that is, each one set in 1½ in. This it was thought would\r\neither require new hangers or a change in the head or shoe in some\r\nway. We found that the hangers could easily be bent without removal.\r\nFig. 34 shows three hangers after passing through the bending process.\r\nA short lever arranged to clasp the hanger just below the point, A,\r\nwas the instrument; a forked \"shore\" is now placed, with the fork,\r\nagainst the point, A, and the other end against the car sill; press\r\ndown on the lever and you bend the hanger at A; lower the lever to a\r\npoint just below B, reverse the process, and you have the bend at B;\r\nthe whole thing taking less than two minutes per hanger. A new bolt\r\nhole, of course, has been bored in the brake beam 1½ in. inside the\r\nold hole. It takes but a short time after this to change the position\r\nof the head and shoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34]\r\n\r\nBefore the day of change, a portion of the spikes were drawn from the\r\ninside of the rail to be moved, and spike set 3 in. inside of the\r\nrail. As a rule two spikes were drawn and the third left. At least\r\nevery third spike was set for the new gauge, and in some cases every\r\nother one.\r\n\r\nThere were several devices with which to set the spike. A small piece\r\nof iron 3 in. wide was common, and answered the purpose well. This had\r\na handle, sometimes small, just large enough for the hand to clasp,\r\nwhile others had a handle long enough for a man to use it without\r\nstooping down. (See Figs. 35 and 36.) Another device is shown in Fig.\r\n37, so arranged that the measurements were made from the head of the\r\nother rail. This was liked best, and, it is thought, gave the best\r\nresults, as the moved rail was more likely to be in good line than\r\nwhen the measurements were taken from the flange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35, FIG. 36 and FIG. 37]\r\n\r\nIt was intended that great care should be taken in driving the spikes,\r\nthat they were in the proper place, square with the rail, and left\r\nsticking up about an inch.\r\n\r\nThe ties, of course, were all adzed down before the day of change.\r\n\r\n\"Handspikes\" were originally used to throw the rails, as were lining\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nWe found, however, that small \"cant hooks\" were more easily handled\r\nand did better work. The first were made like Fig. 38, with a spike in\r\nthe end of a stick, while the hook was fastened with a bolt about 10\r\nor 12 inches above the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38 and FIG. 39]\r\n\r\nWe afterward made them of a 1¼ in. rod, 3½ ft. long, pointed at one\r\nend, with a ring shrunk on 1 ft. from the bottom. Then the hook was\r\nmade with an eye, as shown in Fig. 39, which slipped down over the top\r\nof the main rod. This was simple and cheap, and the iron was to be\r\nused for repair purposes when this work was done.\r\n\r\nUpon the system with which the writer was connected we had some\r\nbranches where we could experiment upon the moving of the rail.\r\nBetween Selma and Lauderdale the traffic was light, and at Lauderdale\r\nit connected with the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, which was narrow, and to\r\nwhich all freight had to be transferred, either by hoisting the cars\r\nor by handling through the house. By changing our gauge we would\r\nsimply change the point of transfer to Selma. Here was a chance to\r\nexperiment upon one hundred miles and cause little trouble to traffic.\r\nWe could see the practical workings of our plans, and, at the same\r\ntime, leave less to do on the final day. Upon the 20th of April we did\r\nthis work. It had been our plan to do it somewhat earlier, but floods\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nMost of the rail was old chair iron, short, and consequently more time\r\nwas used in making the change than would have been required had our\r\nwork been on fishplate rail. Our sections here were about eight miles\r\nlong, and we arranged our men on the basis blocked out by the\r\ncommittee, viz., 24 to 26 men to the section, consisting of 6 spike\r\npullers, 4 throwing rails, 12 spikers, 2 to push the cars and carry\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe soon found 5 ft. cars useless, and threw them into the ditch to be\r\npicked up at some future time.\r\n\r\nThe men were spread out so as not to be in each other's way, and when\r\nthe organization was understood and conformed to, it worked well. One\r\ngang changed 5 miles in 5 hours and 10 minutes, including a number of\r\nswitches. We found, however, and it was demonstrated still more\r\nstrongly on later work, that after 5 or 6 miles the men began to lag.\r\n\r\nWe believed we had the best results when we had sections of about that\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that two sections, alternately, commenced work\r\ntogether at one point, working from each other and continuing until\r\nthe force of another section was met, working from the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe foreman in charge was expected to examine the work and know that\r\nall was right. The push car which followed was a good test as to\r\ngauge.\r\n\r\nA work train was started from each end with a small force (20 or 25\r\nmen) to run over the changed track. This train, of course, had been\r\nchanged on a previous day to be ready for this work.\r\n\r\nIf a force was overtaken by this train with its work not done, the men\r\non the train were at once spread out to aid in its completion. This\r\ndone, the train ran on.\r\n\r\nNot until this was done was a traffic train allowed to pass over the\r\ntrack. The same rule was followed upon all the work.\r\n\r\nUpon the final day it was required that upon all high trestles and in\r\ntunnels the track should be full-spiked before being left or a train\r\nlet over. This took extra time and labor, and possibly was not\r\nnecessary; but it was a precaution on the side of safety.\r\n\r\nUpon the day of the change of the Alabama Central Division (Selma to\r\nLauderdale), superintendents of other divisions, with their road\r\nmasters, supervisors, master mechanics and many section foremen, were\r\nsent over to see the organization and work and the preparations that\r\nhad been made. Many of them lent a helping hand in the work. They saw\r\nhere in practice what had only been theory before.\r\n\r\nAbout a week before the general change that portion of the road\r\nbetween Rome, Ga., and Selma, Ala., about 200 miles, was changed, and\r\nagain men from other divisions were sent to see and aid in the work.\r\nSo when the final day came, the largest possible number of men were\r\nable to work understandingly.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of May the Memphis & Charleston, Knoxville & Ohio, and\r\nNorth Carolina branch were changed, and on June 1 the line from\r\nBristol to Chattanooga and Brunswick.\r\n\r\nOther roads changed their branch lines a day or two before the 1st of\r\nJune; but the main lines, as a rule, were changed on that day.\r\n\r\nIt was a small matter to take care of the cars and arrange the train\r\nservice so there should be no hitches. It was not expected that\r\nconnections would move freight during the 48 hours prior to the\r\nchange, and these days were spent in clearing the road of everything,\r\nand taking the cars to the points of rendezvous. All scheduled freight\r\ntrains were abandoned on the day prior to the change, and only trains\r\nrun _to_ such points.\r\n\r\nUpon the East Tennessee system these points were Knoxville, Rome,\r\nAtlanta, Macon, Huntsville, and Memphis, and to these points all cars\r\nmust go, loaded or empty, and there they were parked upon the tracks\r\nprepared for the purpose. Passenger trains were run to points where it\r\nhad been arranged to change them, generally to the general changing\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMost of the Southern roads have double daily passenger service. Upon\r\nall roads one of these trains, upon the day of change, was abandoned,\r\nand upon some all. Some, even, did not run till next day.\r\n\r\nWe were able to start the day trains out by 10 or 11 o'clock A.M., and\r\nput them through in fair time. Of course, no freights were run that\r\nday, and the next day was used in getting the cars which had been\r\nchanged out of the parks and into line. So our freight traffic over\r\nthe entire South was suspended practically three days.\r\n\r\nThe work of changing was to commence at 3:30 A.M., but many of the men\r\nwere in position at an earlier hour, and did commence work as soon as\r\nthe last train was over, or an hour or so before the fixed time.\r\nHalf-past three A.M., however, can be set down as the general hour of\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\nFor five or six hours in the cool morning the work went on briskly,\r\nthe men working with much more than ordinary enthusiasm. But the day\r\nwas warm, and after 9 or 10 A.M. it began to lag. All was done,\r\nhowever, before the day was over, and safe, so that trains could pass\r\nat full speed.\r\n\r\nThe men all received $1.50 for the work, whether it was finished early\r\nor late in the day, and were paid that afternoon as soon as the work\r\nwas done. Tickets were given the men, which the nearest agent paid,\r\nremitting as cash to the treasurer.\r\n\r\nOn some lines it was deemed best to offer prizes to those who got\r\nthrough first.\r\n\r\nReports showed some very early finishes. But the facts seem to have\r\nbeen that under such encouragement the men were apt to pull _too many_\r\nspikes before the change and put _too few_ in while changing. They\r\nwere thus reported through early, but their work was not done, and\r\nthey took great chances.\r\n\r\nIt was by most considered unwise to offer such prizes, preferring to\r\nhave a little more time taken and be sure that all was safe. Such\r\nlines seemed to get their trains in motion with as much promptness as\r\nothers. This, with freedom from accident, was the end sought.\r\n\r\nIt was found after the work had been done that there had been little\r\ninaccuracies in driving the gauge spike, to which the rail was thrown,\r\nprobably from various causes. The rail to be moved may not always have\r\nbeen exactly in its proper place, and then the template in the hurry\r\nmay not have been accurately placed, or the spike may have turned or\r\ntwisted.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the cause, it was found that frequently the line on the\r\nmoved side was not perfect, and, of course, many spikes had to be\r\ndrawn and the rail lined up and respiked. The more careful the work\r\nhad been done, the less of this there was to do afterward. With rough\r\ntrack this was least seen. The nearer perfect, the more noticeable it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nOf course, we all planned to get foreign cars home and have ours sent\r\nto us. But when the interchange stopped, we found we had many foreign\r\ncars, which, of course, had to be changed. This subject had come up in\r\nconvention and it had been voted to charge three dollars per car when\r\naxles did not need turning, and five dollars where they did. By\r\ncomparison with the cost of changing, as shown in this paper, it will\r\nbe seen that to our company, at least, there was no loss at these\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe following tables will explain the work done upon the Louisville &\r\nNashville and East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia systems.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the writer has not at hand information\r\nregarding other roads, that fuller statements and comparisons might be\r\nmade and the showings be of greater value.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the Mobile & Ohio are added, having been compiled from\r\nthe annual report of that road.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MOBILE & OHIO RAILROAD.\r\n                   (_Compiled from Annual Report._)\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n                      |        |          |          |          |       |\r\n                      | Number | Cost of  | Cost of  |  Total   |Average|\r\n                      |Changed.|  Labor.  | Material |  Cost.   | Cost. |\r\n                      |________|__________|__________|__________|_______|\r\n                      |        |          |          |          |       |\r\nEngines and tenders.  |   47   |$ 8,031.42|$ 7,276.86|$15,308.28|$325.70|\r\nPass., bag., ex. cars.|   55   |    439.37|    104.25|    542.62|   9.87|\r\nFreight cars, 1,361. }|1,468½  |  5,719.03|    739.57|  6,458.60|   4.40|\r\nFreight trucks, 107½.}|        |          |          |          |       |\r\nLever and push cars.  |  143   |  1,427.55|    476.93|  1,904.48|  13.32|\r\n                      |        |          |          |          |       |\r\n                      | Miles. |          |          |          |       |\r\nTrack (inc. sidings). |  583.5 | 17,109.53|  7,275.14| 24,384.87|  41.79|\r\nBridges.              |  583.5 |  1,896.60|    190.00|  2,086.60|   3.58|\r\nTrack tools.          |  583.5 |    170.72|  1,405.74|  1,576.46|   2.70|\r\nShop tools.           |  583.5 |    419.70|  2,982.90|  3,402.60|   5.83|\r\nTemp. side tracks.    |   12.09|  1,958.94|    372.37|  2,331.31| 192.83|\r\nSwitching cars.       |        |  1,398.18|     16.50|  1,414.68|       |\r\nCar hoists.           |        |  2,499.38|  4,419.34|  6,918.72|       |\r\n                      |________|__________|__________|__________|_______|\r\n                      |        |          |          |          |       |\r\n  Total cost.         |        |$41,069.42|$25,259.60|$66,329.02|       |\r\n  Total average cost  |        |          |          |          |       |\r\n   per mile.          |        |          |          |          |$113.68|\r\n______________________|________|__________|__________|__________|_______|\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILROAD.\r\n                 (_Compiled from Annual Report._)\r\n\r\n\r\nMiles of track--Main line              1,893.7\r\n              --Side track               196.3\r\n                                       -------     2,090.0\r\n                                                              Cost\r\n             Track.

RAILWAYS.\r\n\r\n  The mileage changed of the L&N. and E.T., V.& G.\r\n    systems combined aggregates                         3,622 miles.\r\n  The total cost of these two roads.                     $331,492.59\r\n  Or an average per mile of                                    91.52\r\n  Total miles changed was about                        14,500 miles.\r\n  Which would give total cost, at same rate.              $1,327,040\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should really add to this a large sum for the great number of new\r\nlocomotives which were purchased to replace old ones, that could not\r\nbe changed, except at large cost, and which, when done, would have\r\nbeen light and undesirable.\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of the work done upon the L. & N. and E.T., V. & G.\r\nsystems, which, combined, cover about one-fourth the mileage changed,\r\nwe have made the following estimates, which will, perhaps, convey a\r\nbetter idea of the extent of the work than can be obtained in any\r\nother way:\r\n\r\n  Miles of track changed, about                               14,500\r\n  Locomotives changed, about                                   1,800\r\n  Cars (pass, and freight) changed, about                     45,000\r\n  New axles used, about                                        9,000\r\n  New wheels used, about                                      20,000\r\n  Axles turned back, about                                    75,000\r\n  Wheels pressed on without turning axles, about             220,000\r\n  New brasses used, about                                     90,000\r\n  Kegs of spikes used, about                                  50,000\r\n  Cost of material used, about                              $600,000\r\n  Cost of labor, about                                       730,000\r\n  Total cost of work, about                                1,330,000\r\n  Amount expended on equipment, about                        650,000\r\n  Amount expended on track, about                            680,000\r\n  Amount expended on track on day of change in labor, about  140,000\r\n\r\nThe work was done economically, and so quietly that the public hardly\r\nrealized it was in progress. To the casual observer it was an every\r\nday transaction. It was, however, a work of great magnitude, requiring\r\nmuch thought and mechanical ability.\r\n\r\nThat it was ably handled is evidenced by the uniform success attained,\r\nthe prompt changing at the agreed time, and the trifling inconvenience\r\nto the public.--_Jour.

They\r\nare 135 ft. in length by 14 ft. beam, being of the same dimensions as\r\nNo. 80 torpedo boat, lately completed by the above firm for the\r\nAdmiralty, which is the largest and fastest torpedo-boat in the\r\nBritish navy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORPEDO BOATS FOR THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of these torpedo boats is sufficiently clear\r\nfrom the illustrations to need but little description. Suffice it to\r\nsay that the engines are of the triple compound type, capable of\r\nindicating 1,550 horse power, steam being supplied by one large\r\nlocomotive boiler, which our readers are already aware is in\r\naccordance with the usual practice of the makers, as, by using a\r\nsingle boiler, great simplification of the machinery takes place, and\r\nconsiderably less room is occupied than if two boilers were adopted.\r\nIt is worthy of record that although in some torpedo boats, and indeed\r\nin a great number of them, trouble has been found with the locomotive\r\ntype of boiler, still we have no hesitation in saying that this is due\r\neither to defective design or bad workmanship, and that, if properly\r\ndesigned and constructed, such difficulty does not occur. And it is a\r\nfact that Messrs. Yarrow & Co. have already constructed a great number\r\nof locomotive boilers of the exceptional size adopted in these two\r\nSpanish boats, and they have turned out in every respect, after actual\r\nservice, perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe forward part of the boat is provided with two torpedo-ejecting\r\ntubes, as usual, and near the stern, on deck, it is proposed to place\r\nturntables, with two torpedo guns for firing over the sides, as\r\nalready adopted by several governments. The trials of the Azor took\r\nplace about two months since, giving a speed during a run of two hours\r\nand three quarters, carrying a load of 17 tons, of 24 knots (over 27½\r\nmiles) per hour. Since her trial she has steamed out to Spain, having\r\nencountered, during a portion of the voyage very bad weather, when her\r\nsea going qualities were found to be admirable.\r\n\r\nThe Halcon, whose official trials took place lately, obtained a speed\r\nof 23.5 knots, carrying a load of 17 tons. It may be remarked that a\r\nspeed of 24 knots, in a boat only 135 ft in length, under the Spanish\r\nconditions of trial, is by far the best result that has ever been\r\nobtained in a vessel of these dimensions There is, however, no doubt\r\nthat had the length of the boat been greater, a still higher speed\r\nwould have been obtained But it was desired by the authorities to keep\r\nwithin the smallest possible dimensions, so as to expose as little\r\narea as practicable to the fire of the enemy, it being clearly evident\r\nthat this is a consideration of the first importance in an unprotected\r\nwar vessel.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would add that the hulls of these two Spanish boats\r\nare of much greater strength of construction than is usually adopted\r\nin torpedo boats, it having been found that for the sake of obtaining\r\nexceptional speeds, strength sufficient for actual service has often\r\nbeen injudiciously sacrificed And, judging from the numerous accidents\r\nwhich took place at the recent trials off Portland, we have no doubt\r\nthat in the future naval authorities will be quite ready and willing\r\nto sacrifice a little speed so as to obtain vessels which are more\r\ntrustworthy. The necessity for this, we feel convinced, will be\r\nconclusively shown if ever torpedo boats are engaged in actual\r\nwarfare, and this not only as regards strength of hull, but also as\r\nregards the machinery, which at present is only capable of being\r\nhandled successfully by men of exceptional training, who in times of\r\nwar would not be readily procured--_The Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH CRUISER REINA REGENTE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our SUPPLEMENT, No. 620 we gave an illustration of this ship, with\r\nsome particulars. The interest expressed in naval circles for further\r\ninformation induces us to give still further engravings of this\r\nremarkable vessel, with additional information, for which we are\r\nindebted to the _Engineer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW SPANISH WAR SHIP REINA REGENTE.]\r\n\r\nWe gave recently a short account of two of the trials of this vessel,\r\nand we are, by the courtesy of the builders--Messrs. Thomson, of\r\nClydebank--enabled to lay further particulars before our readers this\r\nweek. We give herewith engravings of the vessel, which will illustrate\r\nher salient points. The principal dimensions are as follows.\r\n\r\nLength on water line, 317 ft., breadth, 50 ft. 7 in., depth moulded,\r\n32 ft. 6 in., normal displacement, 4,800 tons, deep load displacement,\r\n5,600 tons. We have before informed our readers that this vessel was\r\ndesigned by Messrs. Thomson, in competition with several other\r\nshipbuilding firms of this and other countries, in reply to an\r\ninvitation of the Spanish government for a cruiser of the first class.\r\nThe design submitted by the builders of the Reina Regente was\r\naccepted, and the vessel was contracted to be built in June of last\r\nyear. The principal conditions of the contract were as follows.\r\n\r\nThe ship to steam at a speed of 20½ knots for four runs on the mile\r\nand for two hours continuously afterward. She was further to be\r\ncapable of steaming for six hours continuously at a speed of 18½\r\nknots, without any artificial means of producing draught. She was also\r\nto be capable of steaming a distance of at least 5,700 knots for 500\r\ntons of coal, at some speed over 10 knots, to be chosen by the\r\nbuilders. Over the length of her machinery and magazine spaces she was\r\nto have a sloping deck extending to 6 ft. below the water line at the\r\nside, and formed of plates 4¾ in. thick. This deck was to extend to\r\nabout 1 ft. above the water line, and the flat part to be 3-1/8 in.\r\nthick. Beyond the machinery and magazine spaces, the deck was to be\r\ngradually reduced to 3 in. thick at the ends. This deck is intended to\r\nprotect the vitals of the ship, such as boilers, engines, powder\r\nmagazines, steering gear, etc., from the effects of shot and shell,\r\nbut the floating and stability maintaining power of the ship was to be\r\ndependent upon a similar structure raised above this protective deck\r\nto a height of about 5 ft. above the water.\r\n\r\nThis structure is covered by a water tight deck known as the main deck\r\nof the ship, on which the cabins and living spaces are arranged. The\r\nspace between the main and protective deck is divided, as may be seen\r\nby reference to the protective deck plan, into many strong, water\r\ntight spaces, most of which are not more than about 500 cubic feet\r\ncapacity. The spaces next to the ship's side are principally coal\r\nbunkers, and may, therefore, exclude largely any water that should\r\nenter. The first line of defense is formed inside these coal bunkers\r\nby a complete girdle of coffer dams, which can be worked from the main\r\ndeck. These it is intended to fill with water and cellulose material,\r\nand as they are also minutely subdivided, the effects of damage by\r\nshot and consequent flooding may be localized to a considerable\r\nextent. The guns of the ship are to consist of four 20 centimeter\r\nHontorio breech loading guns on Vavasseur carriages, six 12 centimeter\r\nguns, eight 6 pounder rapid firing, and eight or ten small guns for\r\nboats and mitrailleuse purposes, four of which are in the crow's nests\r\nat the top of the two masts of the ship. We may remark in passing that\r\nthe builders saw their way at an early period of the construction to\r\nsuggest an addition to the weight of the large sized guns, and there\r\nwill actually be on the ship four 24 centimeter guns, instead of four\r\n20 centimeter. The vessel was to carry five torpedo tubes, two forward\r\nin the bow, one in each broadside, and one aft. All these tubes to be\r\nfixed. To fulfill the speed condition, four boilers were necessary and\r\ntwo sets of triple expansion engines, capable of developing in all\r\n12,000 horse power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROTECTIVE DECK PLAN.]\r\n\r\nNow that the vessel has been completely tried, the promises by the\r\nbuilders may be compared with the results determined by the commission\r\nof Spanish officers appointed by the government of Spain to say\r\nwhether the vessel fulfilled in all respects the conditions laid down\r\nin the contract. The mean speed attained for the two hours' run was\r\n20.6 knots, as compared with 20.5 guaranteed, but this speed was\r\nobtained with 11,500 horse power instead of the 12,000 which the\r\nmachinery is capable of developing. The officers of the Spanish\r\ncommission were anxious not to have the vessel's machinery pressed\r\nbeyond what was necessary to fulfill the speed conditions of the\r\ncontract; but they saw enough to warrant them in expressing their\r\nbelief that the vessel can easily do twenty-one knots when required,\r\nand she actually did this for some time during the trial.\r\n\r\nDuring the natural draught trial the vessel obtained a mean speed of\r\n18.68 knots, on an average of 94¾ revolutions--the forced draught\r\nhaving been done on an average of 105½ revolutions. The consumption\r\ntrial, which lasted twelve hours, was made to determine the radius of\r\naction, when the ship showed that at a speed of 11.6 knots she could\r\nsteam a distance of 5,900 knots. Further trials took place to test the\r\nevolutionary powers of the vessel, though these trials were not\r\nspecified in the contract.\r\n\r\nThe vessel, as may be seen from the engravings, is fitted with a\r\nrudder of a new type, known as Thomson & Biles' rudder, with which it\r\nis claimed that all the advantage of a balanced rudder is obtained,\r\nwhile the ship loses the length due to the adoption of such a rudder.\r\nIt is formed in the shape of the hull of the vessel, and as the\r\npartial balance of the lower foreside gradually reduces the strains,\r\nthe rudder head may be made of very great service. As a matter of\r\nfact, this rudder is 230 ft. in area, and is probably the largest\r\nrudder fitted to a warship. The efficiency of it was shown in the\r\nturning trials, by its being able to bring the vessel round, when\r\ngoing at about nineteen knots, in half a circle in one minute\r\ntwenty-three seconds, and a complete circle in two minutes fifty-eight\r\nseconds, the diameter of the circle being 350 yards. This result, we\r\nbelieve, is unrivaled, and makes this vessel equal in turning\r\ncapabilities to many recent warships not much more than half her\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILM NEGATIVES.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: A communication to the Birmingham Photographic\r\n  Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had a certain measure of success with Eastman stripping films,\r\nI have been requested by your council to give a paper this evening\r\ndealing with the subject, and particularly with the method of working\r\nwhich my experience has found most successful. In according to their\r\nrequest, I feel I have imposed upon myself a somewhat difficult task.\r\n\r\nThere is, undoubtedly, a strong prejudice in the minds of most\r\nphotographers, both amateur and professional, against a negative in\r\nwhich paper is used as a permanent support, on account of the\r\ninseparable \"grain\" and lack of brilliancy in the resulting prints;\r\nand the idea of the paper being used only as a temporary support does\r\nnot seem to convey to their mind a correct impression of the true\r\nposition of the matter.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well before entering into the technical details of the\r\nmanipulation to consider briefly the advantages to be derived--which\r\nwill be better appreciated after an actual trial.\r\n\r\nMy experience (which is at present limited) is that they are far\r\nsuperior to glass for all purposes except portraiture of the human\r\nform or instantaneous pictures where extreme rapidity is necessary,\r\nbut for all ordinary cases of rapid exposure they are sufficiently\r\nquick. The first advantage, which I soon discovered, is their entire\r\nfreedom from halation. This, with glass plates, is inseparable, and\r\neven when much labor has been bestowed on backing them, the halation\r\nis painfully apparent.\r\n\r\nThese films never frill, being made of emulsion which has been made\r\ninsoluble. Compare the respective weights of the two substances--one\r\nplate weighing more than a dozen films of the same size.\r\n\r\nAgain, on comparing a stripping film negative with one on glass of the\r\nsame exposure and subject, it will be found there is a greater\r\nsharpness or clearness in the detail, owing, I am of opinion, to the\r\npaper absorbing the light immediately it has penetrated the emulsion,\r\nthe result being a brilliant negative. Landscapes on stripped films\r\ncan be retouched or printed from on either side, and the advantage in\r\nthis respect for carbon or mechanical printing is enormous. Now,\r\nimagine the tourist working with glass, and compare him to another\r\nworking with films. The one works in harness, tugging, probably, a\r\nhalf hundredweight of glass with him from place to place, paying extra\r\ncarriage, extra tips, and in a continual state of anxiety as to\r\npossible breakage, difficulty of packing, and having to be continually\r\non the lookout for a dark place to change the plates, and, perhaps, on\r\nhis return finds numbers of his plates damaged owing to friction on\r\nthe surface; while the disciple of _films_, lightly burdened with only\r\ncamera and slide, and his (say two hundred) films in his pockets, for\r\nthey lie so compact together. Then the advantages to the tourists\r\nabroad, their name is \"legion,\" not the least being the ease of\r\nguarding your exposed pictures from the custom house officials, who\r\nalmost always seek to make matters disagreeable in this respect, and\r\nlastly, though not least, the ease with which the negatives can be\r\nstowed away in envelopes or albums, etc., when reference to them is\r\neasy in the extreme.\r\n\r\nNow, having come (rightly, I think, you will admit) to the conclusion\r\nthat films have these advantages, you naturally ask, What are their\r\ndisadvantages? Remembering, then, that I am only advocating stripping\r\nfilms, I consider they have but two disadvantages: First, they entail\r\nsome additional outlay in the way of apparatus, etc. Second, they are\r\na little more trouble to finish than the glass negatives, which sink\r\ninto insignificance when the manifold advantages are considered.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal effectively with the second objection I mentioned,\r\nviz., the extra trouble and perseverance, I propose, with your\r\npermission, to carry a negative through the different stages from\r\nexposure to completion, and in so doing I shall endeavor to make the\r\nprocess clear to you, and hope to enlist your attention.\r\n\r\nThe developer I use is slightly different to that of the Eastman\r\ncompany, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n                           A.\r\n    Sulphite of soda.           4 ounces.\r\n\r\nTo be dissolved in 8 ounces of hot distilled water, then rendered\r\nslightly acid with citric acid, then add--\r\n\r\n    Pyrogallic acid.            1 ounce.\r\n    Water to make up to 10 ounces.\r\n\r\n                           B.\r\n    Pure carbonate of soda.     1 ounce.\r\n    Water to make up in all to 10 ounces.\r\n\r\n                           C.\r\n    Pure carbonate of potash.   1 ounce.\r\n    Water to make up to 10 ounces.\r\n\r\n                           D.\r\n    Bromide of potassium.       1 ounce.\r\n    Water to make up to 10 ounces.\r\n\r\nI have here two half-plate films exposed at 8:30 A.M. to-day, one with\r\nfive and one with six seconds' exposure, subject chiefly middle\r\ndistance. I take 90 minims A, 10 minims D, and 90 minims B, and make\r\nup to 2 ounces water. I do not soak the films in water. There is no\r\nneed for it. In fact, it is prejudicial to do so. I place the films\r\nface uppermost in the dish, and pour on the developer on the center of\r\nthe films. You will observe they lie perfectly flat, and are free from\r\nair bubbles. Rock the dish continually during development, and when\r\nthe high lights are out add from 10 to 90 minims C, and finish\r\ndevelopment and fix. The negatives being complete, I ask you to\r\nobserve that both are of equal quality, proving the latitude of\r\nexposure permissible.\r\n\r\nI now coat a piece of glass half an inch larger all round than the\r\nnegative with India rubber solution (see Eastman formula), and\r\nsqueegee the negative face downward upon the rubber, interposing a\r\nsheet of blotting paper and oilskin between the negative and squeegee\r\nto prevent injury to the exposed rubber surface, and then place the\r\nnegative under pressure with blotting paper interposed until\r\nmoderately dry only.\r\n\r\nI then pour hot water upon it, and, gently rocking the dish, you see\r\nthe paper floats from the film without the necessity for pulling it\r\nwith a pin, leaving the film negative on the glass. Now, the\r\ninstructions say remove the remaining soluble gelatine with camel's\r\nhair brush, but, unless it requires intensifying, which no properly\r\ndeveloped negative should require, you need not do so, but simply pour\r\non the gelatine solution (see Eastman formula), well covering the\r\nedges of the film, and put on a level shelf to dry.\r\n\r\nI will now take up a negative in this state on the glass, but dry, and\r\ncarefully cut round the edges of the film, and you see I can readily\r\npull off the film with its gelatine support. Having now passed through\r\nthe whole of the process, it behooves us to consider for a few minutes\r\nthe causes of failure in the hands of beginners and their remedies: 1.\r\nThe rubber will not flow over glass? Solution too thick, glass greasy.\r\n2. Rubber peels off on drying? Dirty glass. 3. Negative not dense\r\nenough? Use more bromide and longer development. 4. Gelatine cracks on\r\nbeing pulled off? Add more glycerine. 5. Gelatine not thick enough?\r\nGelatine varnish too thin, not strong enough. 6. Does not dry\r\nsufficiently hard? Too much glycerine.--_E.H.

The coal\r\nconsumed for the nine generators varies between 860 and 1,200 pounds\r\nper hour and per 10 square feet of section.\r\n\r\nThe ground that was to support this chimney consisted of very\r\naquiferous, cracked beds of marl, disintegrated by infiltrations of\r\nwater from the distillery, and alternating with strata of clay. It\r\nbecame necessary, therefore, to build as light a chimney as possible.\r\nThe problem was solved as follows, by Mr. Guendt, who was then\r\nsuperintendent of the Rocourt establishment.\r\n\r\nUpon a wide concrete foundation a pedestal was built, in which were\r\nunited the various smoke conduits, and upon this pedestal were erected\r\nfour lattice girders, C, connected with each other by St. Andrew's\r\ncrosses. The internal surface of these girders is vertical and the\r\nexternal is inclined. Within the framework there was built a five-inch\r\nthick masonry wall of bricks, made especially for the purpose. The\r\nmasonry was then strengthened and its contact with the girders assured\r\nby numerous hoops, especially at the lower part; some of them\r\ninternal, others external, to the surface of the girders, and others\r\nof angle irons, all in four parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--HORIZONTAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe anchors rest upon a cast iron foundation plate connected, through\r\nstrong bolts embedded in the pedestal, with a second plate resting\r\nupon the concrete.\r\n\r\nAs the metallic framework was calculated for resisting the wind, the\r\nbrick lining does not rest against it permanently above. The weight of\r\nthe chimney is 1,112,200 pounds, and the foundation is about 515\r\nsquare feet in area; and, consequently, the pressure upon the ground\r\nis about 900 pounds to the square inch. The cost was $3,840.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--VERTICAL SECTION OF THE CHIMNEY.]\r\n\r\nThe chimney was built six years ago, and has withstood the most\r\nviolent hurricanes.\r\n\r\nThe mounting of the iron framework was effected by means of a motor\r\nand two men, and took a month. The brick lining was built up in eight\r\ndays by a mason and his assistant.\r\n\r\nA chimney of the same size, all of brick, erected on the same\r\nfoundation, would have weighed 2,459,600 pounds (say a load of 3,070\r\npounds to the square inch), and would have cost about $2,860.\r\n\r\nThe chimney of the Rocourt distillery is, therefore, lighter by half,\r\nand cost about a third more, than one of brick; but, at the present\r\nprice of metal, the difference would be slight.--_Annales\r\nIndustrielles._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN BY BRIN'S PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderable interest has been aroused lately in scientific and\r\nindustrial circles by a report that separation of the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen of the air was being effected on a large scale in London by a\r\nprocess which promises to render the gases available for general\r\napplication in the arts. The cheap manufacture of the compounds of\r\nnitrogen from the gas itself is still a dream of chemical enthusiasts;\r\nand though the pure gas is now available, the methods of making its\r\ncompounds have yet to be devised. But the industrial processes which\r\nalready depend directly or indirectly on the chemical union of bodies\r\nwith atmospheric oxygen are innumerable.\r\n\r\nIn all these processes the action of the gas is impeded by the bulky\r\npresence of its fellow constituent of air, nitrogen. We may say, for\r\ninstance, in homely phrase, that whenever a fire burns there are four\r\nvolumes of nitrogen tending to extinguish it for every volume of\r\noxygen supporting its combustion, and to the same degree the nitrogen\r\ninterferes with all other processes of atmospheric oxidation, of which\r\nmost metallurgical operations may be given as instances. If, then, it\r\nhas become possible to remove this diluent gas simply and cheaply in\r\norder to give the oxygen free play in its various applications, we are\r\ndoubtless on the eve of a revolution among some of the most extensive\r\nand familiar of the world's industries.\r\n\r\nA series of chemical reactions has long been known by means of which\r\noxygen could be separated out of air in the laboratory, and at various\r\ntimes processes based on these reactions have been patented for the\r\nproduction of oxygen on a large scale. Until recently, however, none\r\nof these methods gave sufficiently satisfactory results. The simplest\r\nand perhaps the best of them was based on the fact first noticed by\r\nBoussingault, that when baryta (BaO) is heated to low redness in a\r\ncurrent of air, it takes up oxygen and becomes barium dioxide\r\n(BaO_{2}), and that this dioxide at a higher temperature is\r\nreconverted into free oxygen and baryta, the latter being ready for\r\nuse again. For many years it was assumed, however, by chemists that\r\nthis ideally simple reaction was inapplicable on a commercial scale,\r\nowing to the gradual loss of power to absorb oxygen which was always\r\nfound to take place in the baryta after a certain number of\r\noperations. About eight years ago Messrs. A. & L. Brin, who had\r\nstudied chemistry under Boussingault, undertook experiments with the\r\nview of determining why the baryta lost its power of absorbing oxygen.\r\n\r\nThey found that it was owing to molecular and physical changes caused\r\nin it by impurities in the air used and by the high temperature\r\nemployed for decomposing the dioxide. They discovered that by heating\r\nthe dioxide in a partial vacuum the temperature necessary to drive off\r\nits oxygen was much reduced. They also found that by supplying the air\r\nto the baryta under a moderate pressure, its absorption of oxygen was\r\ngreatly assisted. Under these conditions, and by carefully purifying\r\nthe air before use, they found that it became possible to use the\r\nbaryta an indefinite number of times. Thus the process became\r\npractically, as it was theoretically, continuous.\r\n\r\nAfter securing patent protection for their process, Messrs. Brin\r\nerected a small producer in Paris, and successfully worked it for\r\nnearly three years without finding a renewal of the original charge of\r\nbaryta once necessary. This producer was exhibited at the Inventions\r\nExhibition in London, in 1885. Subsequently an English company was\r\nformed, and in the autumn of last year Brin's Oxygen Company began\r\noperations in Horseferry Road, Westminster, where a large and complete\r\ndemonstration plant was erected, and the work commenced of developing\r\nthe production and application of oxygen in the industrial world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR MAKING OXYGEN.]\r\n\r\nWe give herewith details of the plant now working at Westminster. It\r\nis exceedingly simple. On the left of the side elevation and plan are\r\nshown the retorts, on the right is an arrangement of pumps for\r\nalternately supplying air under pressure and exhausting the oxygen\r\nfrom the retorts. As is shown in the plan, two sets of apparatus are\r\nworked side by side at Westminster, the seventy-two retorts shown in\r\nthe drawings being divided into two systems of thirty-six. Each system\r\nis fed by the two pumps on the corresponding side of the boiler. Each\r\nset of retorts consists of six rows of six retorts each, one row above\r\nthe other. They are heated by a small Wilson's producer, so that the\r\nattendant can easily regulate the supply of heat and obtain complete\r\ncontrol over the temperature of the retorts. The retorts, A, are made\r\nof wrought iron and are about 10 ft long and 8 in. diameter.\r\nExperience, however, goes to prove that there is a limit to the\r\ndiameter of the retorts beyond which the results become less\r\nsatisfactory. This limit is probably somewhat under 8 in. Each retort\r\nis closely packed with baryta in lumps about the size of a walnut. The\r\nbaryta is a heavy grayish porous substance prepared by carefully\r\nigniting the nitrate of barium; and of this each retort having the\r\nabove dimensions holds about 125 lb. The retorts so charged are closed\r\nat each end by a gun metal lid riveted on so as to be air tight. From\r\nthe center of each lid a bent gun metal pipe, B, connects each retort\r\nwith the next of its series, so that air introduced into the end\r\nretort of any row may pass through the whole series of six retorts.\r\nSuppose now that the operations are to commence.\r\n\r\nThe retorts are first heated to a temperature of about 600° C. or\r\nfaint redness, then the air pumps, C C, are started. Air is drawn by\r\nthem through the purifier, D, where it is freed from carbon dioxide\r\nand moisture by the layers of quicklime and caustic soda with which\r\nthe purifier is charged. The air is then forced along the pipe, E,\r\ninto the small air vessel, F, which acts as a sort of cushion to\r\nprevent the baryta in the retorts being disturbed by the pulsation of\r\nthe pumps. From this vessel the air passes by the pipe, G, and is\r\ndistributed in the retorts as rapidly as possible at such a pressure\r\nthat the nitrogen which passes out unabsorbed at the outlet registers\r\nabout 15 lb. to the square inch. With the baryta so disposed in the\r\nretorts as to present as large a superficies as possible to the action\r\nof the air, it is found that in 1½ to 2 hours--during which time about\r\n12,000 cub. ft of air have been passed through the retorts--the gas at\r\nthe outlet fails to extinguish a glowing chip, indicating that oxygen\r\nis no longer being absorbed. The pumping now ceases, and the\r\ntemperature of the retorts is raised to about 800° C. The workman is\r\nable to judge the temperature with sufficient accuracy by means of the\r\nsmall inspection holes, H, fitted with panes of mica, through which\r\nthe color of the heat in the furnace can be distinguished. The pumps\r\nare now reversed and the process of exhaustion begins. At Westminster\r\nthe pressure in the retorts is reduced to about 1½ in. of mercury. In\r\nthis partial vacuum the oxygen is given off rapidly, and if forced by\r\nthe pumps through another pipe and away into an ordinary gas holder,\r\nwhere it is stored for use. With powerful pumps such as are used in\r\nthe plant under notice the whole of the oxygen can be drawn off in an\r\nhour, and from one charge a yield of about 2,000 cub. ft. is obtained.\r\nWith a less perfect vacuum the time is longer--even as much as four\r\nhours. The whole operation of charging and exhausting the retorts can\r\nbe completed in from three to four hours. As soon as the evolution of\r\noxygen is finished, the doors, K, and ventilators, L, may be opened\r\nand the retorts cooled for recharging.\r\n\r\nThe cost of producing oxygen at Westminster, under specially expensive\r\nconditions, is high--about 12s. per 1,000 cub. ft. When we consider,\r\nhowever, that the cost should only embrace attendance, fuel, wear and\r\ntear, and a little lime and soda for the purifiers, that the\r\nconsumption of fuel is small, the wear and tear light, and that the\r\nraw material--air--is obtained for nothing, it ought to be possible to\r\nproduce the gas for a third or fourth of this amount in most of our\r\ngreat manufacturing centers, where the price of fuel is but a third of\r\nthat demanded in London, and where provision could be made for\r\neconomizing the waste heat, which is entirely lost in the Westminster\r\ninstallation. Moreover, in estimating this cost all the charges are\r\nthrown on the oxygen; were there any means of utilizing the 4,000 cub.\r\nft. of nitrogen at present blown away as waste for every thousand\r\ncubic feet of oxygen produced, the nitrogen would of course bear its\r\nshare of the cost.\r\n\r\nThe question of the application of the oxygen is one which must be\r\ndetermined in its manifold bearings mainly by the experiments of\r\nchemists and scientific men engaged in industrial work. Having\r\nascertained the method by which and the limit of cost within which it\r\nis possible to use oxygen in their work, it can be seen whether by\r\nBrin's process the gas can be obtained within that limit.\r\n\r\nMr. S.R. Ogden, the manager of the corporation gasworks at Blackburn,\r\nhas already made interesting experiments on the application of oxygen\r\nin the manufacture of illuminating gas. In order to purify coal gas\r\nfrom compounds of sulphur, it is passed through purifiers charged with\r\nlayers of oxide of iron. When the oxide of iron has absorbed as much\r\nsulphur as it can combine with, it is described as \"foul.\" It is then\r\ndischarged and spread out in the open air, when, under the influence\r\nof the atmospheric oxygen, it is rapidly decomposed, the sulphur is\r\nseparated out in the free state, and oxide of iron is reformed ready\r\nfor use again in the purifiers. This process is called revivification,\r\nand it is repeated until the accumulation of sulphur in the oxide is\r\nso great (45 to 55 per cent.) that it can be profitably sold to the\r\nvitriol maker. Hawkins discovered that by introducing about 3 per\r\ncent. of air into the gas before passing it through the purifiers, the\r\noxygen of the air introduced set free the sulphur from the iron as\r\nfast as it was absorbed. Thus the process of revivification could be\r\ncarried on in the purifiers themselves simultaneously with the\r\nabsorption of the sulphur impurities in the gas.\r\n\r\nA great saving of labor was thus effected, and also an economy in the\r\nuse of the iron oxide, which in this way could be left in the\r\npurifiers until charged with 75 per cent. of sulphur. Unfortunately it\r\nwas found that this introduction of air for the sake of its oxygen\r\nmeant also the introduction of much useless nitrogen, which materially\r\nreduced the illuminating power of the gas. To restore this\r\nilluminating power the gas had to be recarbureted, and this again\r\nmeant cost in labor and material. Now, Mr. Ogden has found by a series\r\nof conclusive experiments made during a period of seventy-eight days\r\nupon a quantity of about 4,000,000 cub. ft. of gas, that by\r\nintroducing 1 per cent. of oxygen into the gas instead of 3 per cent.\r\nof air, not only is the revivification _in situ_ effected more\r\nsatisfactorily than with air, but at the same time the illuminating\r\npower of the gas, so far from being decreased, is actually increased\r\nby one candle unit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN BY BRIN'S PROCESS.]\r\n\r\nSo satisfied is he with his results that he has recommended the\r\ncorporation to erect a plant for the production of oxygen at the\r\nBlackburn gas works, by which he estimates that the saving to the town\r\non the year's make of gas will be something like £2,500. The practical\r\nobservations of Mr. Ogden are being followed up by a series of\r\nexhaustive experiments by Mr. Valon, A.M. Inst. C.E., also a gas\r\nengineer. The make of an entire works at Westgate is being treated by\r\nhim with oxygen. Mr. Valon has not yet published his report, as the\r\nexperiments are not quite complete; but we understand that his results\r\nare even more satisfactory than those obtained at Blackburn.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we may indicate a few other of the numerous possible\r\napplications of cheap oxygen which might be realized in the near\r\nfuture. The greatest illuminating effect from a given bulk of gas is\r\nobtained by mixing it with the requisite proportion of oxygen, and\r\nholding in the flame of the burning mixture a piece of some solid\r\ninfusible and non-volatile substance, such as lime. This becomes\r\nheated to whiteness, and emits an intense light know as the Drummond\r\nlight, used already for special purposes of illumination. By supplying\r\noxygen in pipes laid by the side of the ordinary gas mains, it would\r\nbe possible to fix small Drummond lights in place of the gas burners\r\nnow used in houses; this would greatly reduce the consumption of gas\r\nand increase the light obtained, or even render possible the\r\nemployment of cheap non-illuminating combustible gases other than coal\r\ngas for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo obstacles at present lie in the way of this consummation--the cost\r\nof the oxygen and the want of a convenient and completely refractory\r\nmaterial to take the place of the lime. Messrs. Brin believe they have\r\novercome the first obstacle, and are addressing themselves, we\r\nbelieve, to the removal of the second. Again, the intense heat which\r\nthe combustion of carbon in cheap oxygen will place at the disposal of\r\nthe metallurgist cannot fail to play an important part in his\r\noperations. There are many processes, too, of metal refining which\r\nought to be facilitated by the use of the gas. Then the production of\r\npure metallic oxides for the manufacture of paints, the bleaching of\r\noils and fats, the reduction of refractory ores of the precious metals\r\non a large scale, the conversion of iron into steel, and numberless\r\nother processes familiar to the specialists whose walk is in the\r\nbyways of applied chemistry, should all profit by the employment of\r\nthis energetic agent. Doubtless, too, the investigation into methods\r\nof producing the compounds of nitrogen so indispensable as plant\r\nfoods, and for which we are now dependent on the supplies of the\r\nmineral world, may be stimulated by the fact that there is available\r\nby Brin's process a cheap and inexhaustible supply of pure\r\nnitrogen.--_Industries._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH DISINFECTING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED DISINFECTING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nWe represent herewith a sanitary train that was very successfully used\r\nduring the prevalence of an epidemic of _sudor Anglicus_ in Poitou\r\nthis year. It consisted of a movable stove and a boiler. In reality,\r\nto save time, such agricultural locomotives as could be found were\r\nutilized; but hereafter, apparatus like those shown in the engraving,\r\nand which are specially constructed to accompany the stoves, will be\r\nemployed. We shall quote from a communication made by Prof. Brouardel\r\nto the Academy of Medicine on this subject, at its session of\r\nSeptember 13:\r\n\r\nIn the country we can never think of disinfecting houses with\r\nsulphurous acid, as the peasants often have but a single room, in\r\nwhich the beds of the entire family are congregated. Every one knows\r\nthat the agglomerations that compose the same department are often\r\ndistant from each other and the chief town by from two to three miles\r\nor more. This is usually the case in the departments of Vienne, Haute\r\nVienne, Indre, etc. To find a disinfecting place in the chief town of\r\nthe department is still difficult, and to find one in each of the\r\nhamlets is absolutely impossible. Families in which there are invalids\r\nare obliged to carry clothing and bedding to the chief town to be\r\ndisinfected, and to go after them after the expiration of twenty-four\r\nhours. This is not an easy thing to do.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand what difficulties must be met with in many\r\ncases, and so one has to be content to prescribe merely washing, and\r\nbleaching with lime--something that is simple and everywhere accepted,\r\nbut insufficient. So, then, disinfection with sulphurous acid, which\r\nis easy in large cities, as was taught by the cholera epidemics of\r\nlast year, is often difficult in the country. The objection has always\r\nbe made to it, too, that it is of doubtful efficacy. It is not for us\r\nto examine this question here, but there is no doubt that damp steam\r\nalone, under pressure, effects a perfect disinfection, and that if\r\nthis mode of disinfection could be applied in the rural districts (as\r\nit can be easily done in cities), the public health would be better\r\nprotected in case of an epidemic.\r\n\r\nIn cities one or more stationary steam stoves can always be arranged;\r\nbut in the country movable ones are necessary. From instructions given\r\nby Prof. Brouardel, Messrs. Geneste & Herscher have solved the problem\r\nof constructing such stoves in a few days, and four have been put at\r\nthe disposal of the mission.\r\n\r\nDr. Thoinot, who directed this mission, in order to make an experiment\r\nwith these apparatus, selected two points in which cases of _sudor_\r\nwere still numerous, and in which the conditions were entirely\r\ndifferent, and permitted of studying the working of the service and\r\napparatus under various phases. One of these points was Dorat, chief\r\ntown of Haute Vienne, a locality with a crowded population and\r\npresenting every desirable resource; and the other was the commune of\r\nMauvieres, in Indre, where the population was scattered through\r\nseveral hamlets.\r\n\r\nThe first stove was operated at Dorat, on the 29th of June, and the\r\nsecond at Mauvieres, on the 1st of July. A gendarme accompanied the\r\nstove in all its movements and remained with it during the\r\ndisinfecting experiments. The Dorat stove was operated on the 29th of\r\nJune and the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July. On the 30th of June it proceeded\r\nto disinfect the commune of Darnac. The Mauvieres stove, in the first\r\nplace, disinfected the chief town of this commune on the 1st of July,\r\nand on the next day it was taken to Poulets, a small hamlet, and a\r\ndependent of the commune of Mauvieres. All the linen and all the\r\nclothing of the sick of this locality, which had been the seat of\r\n_sudor_, especially infantile, was disinfected. On the 4th of July,\r\nthe stove went to Concremiers, a commune about three miles distant,\r\nand there finished up the disinfection that until then had been\r\nperformed in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic was almost everywhere on the wane at this epoch; but we\r\njudge that the test of the stoves was sufficient.\r\n\r\nWe are able to advance the following statement boldly: For the\r\napplication of disinfection in the rural districts, the movable stove\r\nis the most practical thing that we know of. It is easily used, can be\r\ntaken to the smallest hamlets, and can be transported over the\r\nroughest roads. It inspires peasants with no distrust. The first\r\nrepugnance is easily overcome, and every one, upon seeing that objects\r\ncome from the stove unharmed, soon hastens to bring to it all the\r\ncontaminated linen, etc., that he has in the house.\r\n\r\nFurther, we may add that the disinfection is accomplished in a quarter\r\nof an hour, and that it therefore keeps the peasant but a very short\r\ntime from his work--an advantage that is greatly appreciated. Finally,\r\na day well employed suffices to disinfect a small settlement\r\ncompletely. Upon the whole, disinfection by the stove under\r\nconsideration is the only method that can always and everywhere be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it is called upon to render the greatest services in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe movable stove, regarding which Prof. Brouardel expresses himself\r\nin the above terms, consists of a cylindrical chamber, 3½ feet in\r\ninternal diameter and 5 feet in length, closed in front by a\r\nhermetically jointed door. This cylinder, which constitutes the\r\ndisinfection chamber, is mounted upon wheels and is provided with\r\nshafts, so that it can easily be hauled by a horse or mule. The\r\ncylinder is of riveted iron plate, and is covered with a wooden\r\njacket. The door is provided with a flange that enters a rubber lined\r\ngroove in the cylinder, and to it are riveted wrought iron forks that\r\nreceive the nuts of hinged bolts fixed upon the cylinder. The nuts are\r\nscrewed up tight, and the flange of the door, compressing the rubber\r\nlining, renders the joint hermetical. The door, which is hinged, is\r\nprovided with a handle, which, when the stove is closed, slides over\r\nan inclined plane fixed to the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe steam enters a cast iron box in the stove through a rubber tube\r\nprovided with a threaded coupling. The entrance of the steam is\r\nregulated by a cock. The box is provided with a safety and pressure\r\ngauge and a small pinge cock. In the interior of the stove the\r\nentrance of the steam is masked by a large tinned copper screen, which\r\nis situated at the upper part and preserves the objects under\r\ntreatment from drops of water of condensation. These latter fall here\r\nand there from the screen, follow the sides of the cylinder, and\r\ncollect at the bottom, from whence they are drawn off through a cock\r\nplaced in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe sides are lined internally with wood, which prevents the objects\r\nto be infected from coming into contact with the metal. The objects to\r\nbe treated are placed upon wire cloth shelves. The pinge cock likewise\r\nserves for drawing off the air or steam contained in the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe stove is supported upon an axle through the intermedium of two\r\nangle irons riveted longitudinally upon the cylinder. The axle is\r\ncranked, and its wheels, which are of wood, are 4½ feet in diameter.\r\nThe shafts are fixed to the angle irons. The apparatus is, in\r\naddition, provided with a seat, a brake, and prop rods before and\r\nbehind to keep it horizontal when in operation.\r\n\r\nThe boiler that supplies this stove is vertical and is mounted upon\r\nfour wheels. It is jacketed with wood, and is provided with a water\r\nlevel, two gauge cocks, a pressure gauge, two spring safety valves, a\r\nsteam cock provided with a rubber tube that connects with that of the\r\nstove, an ash pan, and a smoke stack. In the rear there are two\r\ncylindrical water reservoirs that communicate with each other, and are\r\ndesigned to feed the boiler through an injector. Beneath these\r\nreservoirs there is a fuel box. In front there is a seat whose box\r\nserves to hold tools and various other objects.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRICAL GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe abstract the following from a paper on electric lighting by Prof.\r\nJ.A. Fleeming, read before the Iron and Steel Institute, Manchester.\r\nThe illustration is from _Engineering_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRICAL GOVERNOR.]\r\n\r\nOne of the questions which most frequently occurs in reference to mill\r\nand factory lighting is whether the factory engines can be used to run\r\nthe dynamo. As a broad, general rule, there can be no question that\r\nthe best results are obtained by using a separate dynamo engine,\r\ncontrolled by a good governor, set apart for that purpose. With an\r\nordinary shunt dynamo, the speed ought not to vary more than 2 or 3\r\nper cent. of its normal value on either side of that value. Hence, if\r\na dynamo has a normal speed of 1,000, it should certainly not vary\r\nover a greater range than from 970 to 980 to 1,020 to 1,030. In many\r\ncases there may be shafting from which the necessary power can be\r\ntaken, and of which the speed is variable only within these limits.\r\nThere are several devices by which it has been found possible to\r\nenable a dynamo to maintain a constant electromotive force, even if\r\nthe speed of rotation varies over considerable limits. One of these is\r\nthat (see illustration) due to Messrs. Trotter & Ravenshaw, and\r\napplicable to shunt or series machines.\r\n\r\nIn the circuit of the field magnet is placed a variable resistance.\r\nThis resistance is thrown in or out by means of a motor device\r\nactuated by an electromotive force indicator. A plunger of soft iron\r\nis suspended from a spring, and hangs within a solenoid of wire, which\r\nsolenoid is in connection with the terminals of the dynamo. Any\r\nincrease or diminution of the electromotive force causes this iron to\r\nmove in or out of the core, and its movement is made to connect or\r\ndisconnect the gearing which throws in the field magnet resistance\r\nwith a shaft driven by the engine itself. The principle of the\r\napparatus is therefore that small variations of electromotive force\r\nare made to vary inversely the strength of the magnetic field through\r\nthe intervention of a relay mechanism in which the power required to\r\neffect the movement is tapped from the engine.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of such a governor it is possible to drive a dynamo from\r\na mill shaft providing the requisite power, but of which the speed of\r\nrotation is not sufficiently uniform to secure alone efficient\r\nregulation of electromotive force. Another device, patented by Mr.\r\nCrompton, is a modification of that method of field magnet winding\r\ncommonly known as compound winding. The field magnets are wound over\r\nwith two wires, one of which has a high resistance and is arranged as\r\na shunt, and the other of which has a low resistance and is arranged\r\nin series. Instead, however, of the magnetizing powers of these coils\r\nbeing united in the same direction as an ordinary compound winding,\r\nthey are opposed to one another. That is to say, the current in the\r\nshunt wire tends to magnetize the iron of the field magnets in an\r\nopposite direction to that of the series wire. It results from this\r\nthat any slight increase of speed diminishes the strength of the\r\nmagnetic field, and _vice versa_. Accordingly, within certain limits,\r\nthe electromotive force of the dynamo is independent of the speed of\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC CURRENT AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE TRACTIVE ADHESION OF\r\nRAILWAY MOTORS AND OTHER ROLLING CONTACTS.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Read before the American Association for the\r\n  Advancement of Science. New York meeting, 1887.]\r\n\r\nBy ELIAS E. RIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is to lay before you the results of some\r\nrecent experiments in a comparatively new field of operation, but one\r\nthat, judging from the results already attained, is destined to become\r\nof great importance and value in its practical application to various\r\nbranches of industry.\r\n\r\nI say \"comparatively new\" because the underlying principles involved\r\nin the experiments referred to have, to a certain extent, been\r\nemployed (in, however, a somewhat restricted sense) for purposes\r\nanalogous to those that form the basis of this communication.\r\n\r\nAs indicated by the title, the subject that will now occupy our\r\nattention is the use of the electric current as a means of increasing\r\nand varying the frictional adhesion of rolling contacts and other\r\nrubbing surfaces, and it is proposed to show how this effect may be\r\nproduced, both by means of the direct action of the current itself and\r\nby its indirect action through the agency of electro-magnetism.\r\n\r\nProbably the first instance in which the electric current was directly\r\nemployed to vary the amount of friction between two rubbing surfaces\r\nwas exemplified in Edison's electro-motograph, in which the variations\r\nin the strength of a telephonic current caused corresponding\r\nvariations in friction between a revolving cylinder of moistened chalk\r\nand the free end of an adjustable contact arm whose opposite extremity\r\nwas attached to the diaphragm of the receiving telephone. This device\r\nwas extremely sensitive to the least changes in current strength, and\r\nif it were not for the complication introduced by the revolving\r\ncylinder, it is very likely that it would to-day be more generally\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIt has also been discovered more recently that in the operation of\r\nelectric railways in which the track rails form part of the circuit, a\r\nconsiderable increase in the tractive adhesion of the driving wheels\r\nis manifested, due to the passage of the return current from the\r\nwheels into the track. In the Baltimore and Hampden electric railway,\r\nusing the Daft \"third rail\" system, this increased tractive adhesion\r\nenables the motors to ascend without slipping a long grade of 350 feet\r\nto the mile, drawing two heavily loaded cars, which result, it is\r\nclaimed, is not attainable by steam or other self-propelling motors of\r\nsimilar weight. In the two instances just cited the conditions are\r\nwidely different, as regards the nature of the current employed, the\r\nmechanical properties of the surfaces in contact, and the electrical\r\nresistance and the working conditions of the respective circuits. In\r\nboth, however, as clearly demonstrated by the experiments hereinafter\r\nreferred to, the cause of the increased friction is substantially the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the practical value of the electric current as a\r\nmeans of increasing mechanical friction, and, if possible, render it\r\ncommercially and practically useful wherever such additional friction\r\nmight be desirable, as for example in the transmission of power, etc.,\r\na series of experiments were entered into by the author, which, though\r\nnot yet fully completed, are sufficiently advanced to show that an\r\nelectric current, when properly applied, is capable of very materially\r\nincreasing the mechanical friction of rotating bodies, in some cases\r\nas much as from 50 to 100 per cent., with a very economical\r\nexpenditure of current; this increase depending upon the nature of the\r\nsubstances in contact and being capable of being raised by an\r\nincreased flow of current.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into a description of the means by which this result\r\nis produced, and how it is proposed to apply this method practically\r\nto railway and other purposes, it may be well to give a general\r\noutline of what has so far been determined. These experiments have\r\nshown that the coefficient of friction between two conducting surfaces\r\nis very much increased by the passage therethrough of an electric\r\ncurrent of _low electromotive force and large volume_, and this is\r\nespecially noticeable between two rolling surfaces in peripheral\r\ncontact with each other, or between a rolling and a stationary\r\nsurface, as in the case of a driving wheel running upon a railway\r\nrail. This effect increases with the number of amperes of current\r\nflowing through the circuit, of which the two surfaces form part, and\r\nis not materially affected by the electromotive force, so long as the\r\nlatter is sufficient to overcome the electrical resistance of the\r\ncircuit. This increase in frictional adhesion is principally\r\nnoticeable in iron, steel, and other metallic bodies, and is due to a\r\nmolecular change in the conducting substances at their point of\r\ncontact (which is also the point of greatest resistance in the\r\ncircuit), caused by the heat developed at that point. This heat is\r\nordinarily imperceptible, and becomes apparent only when the current\r\nstrength is largely augmented. It is therefore probable that a portion\r\nof this increased tractive adhesion is due directly to the current\r\nitself aside from its heating effect, although I have not as yet been\r\nable to ascertain this definitely. The most economical and efficient\r\nresults have been obtained by the employment of a transformed current\r\nof extremely low electromotive force (between ½ and 1 volt), but of\r\nvery large volume or quantity, this latter being variable at will, so\r\nas to obtain different degrees of frictional resistance in the\r\nsubstances under observation.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were originally directed mainly toward an endeavor\r\nto increase the tractive adhesion of the driving wheels of locomotives\r\nand other vehicles, and to utilize the electric current for this\r\npurpose in such a manner as to render it entirely safe, practical, and\r\neconomical. It will be apparent at once that a method of increasing\r\nthe tractive power of the present steam locomotives by more than 50\r\nper cent. without adding to their weight and without injury to the\r\nroadbed and wheel tires, such as is caused by the sand now commonly\r\nused, would prove of considerable value, and the same holds true with\r\nrespect to electrically propelled street cars, especially as it has\r\nbeen found exceedingly difficult to secure sufficient tractive\r\nadhesion on street railways during the winter season, as well as at\r\nother times, on roads having grades of more than ordinary steepness.\r\nAs this, therefore, is probably the most important use for this\r\napplication of the electric current, it has been selected for\r\nillustrating this paper.\r\n\r\nI have here a model car and track arranged to show the equipment and\r\noperation of the system as applied to railway motors. The current in\r\nthe present instance is one of alternating polarity which is converted\r\nby this transformer into one having the required volume. The\r\nelectromotive force of this secondary current is somewhat higher than\r\nis necessary. In practice it would be about half a volt. You will\r\nnotice upon a closer inspection that one of the forward driving wheels\r\nis insulated from its axle, and the transformed current, after passing\r\nto a regulating switch under the control of the engineer or driver,\r\ngoes to this insulated wheel, from which it enters the track rail,\r\nthen through the rear pair of driving wheels and axles to the opposite\r\nrail, and then flows up through the forward uninsulated wheel, from\r\nthe axle of which it returns by way of a contact brush to the opposite\r\nterminal of the secondary coil of the transformer. Thus the current is\r\nmade to flow _seriatim_ through all four of the driving wheels,\r\ncompleting its circuit through that portion of the rails lying between\r\nthe two axles, and generating a sufficient amount of heat at each\r\npoint of contact to produce the molecular change before referred to.\r\nBy means of the regulating switch the engineer can control the amount\r\nof current flowing at any time, and can even increase its strength to\r\nsuch an extent, in wet or slippery weather, as to _evaporate any\r\nmoisture_ that may adhere to the surface of the rails at the point of\r\ncontact with the wheels while the locomotive or motor car is under\r\nfull speed.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent that inasmuch as the \"traction circuit\" moves\r\nalong with the locomotive, and is complete through its driving wheel\r\nbase, the track rails in front and rear of the same are at all times\r\nentirely free from current, _and no danger whatever can occur by\r\ncoming in contact with the rails between successive motors_. Moreover,\r\nthe potential used in the present arrangement, while sufficient to\r\novercome the extremely low resistance of the moving circuit, is too\r\nsmall to cause an appreciable loss of current from that portion of the\r\nrails in circuit, even under the most unfavorable conditions of the\r\nweather. In practice the primary current necessary is preferably\r\ngenerated by a small high speed alternating dynamo on the locomotive,\r\nthe current being converted by means of an inductional transformer. To\r\navoid the necessity for electrically bridging the rail joints, a\r\nmodified arrangement may be employed, in which the electrical\r\nconnection is made directly with a fixed collar on the forward and\r\nrear driving axles, the current dividing itself in parallel between\r\nthe two rails in such a manner that, if a defective joint exists in\r\nthe rail at one side, the circuit is still complete through the rail\r\non the other; and as the rails usually break joints on opposite sides,\r\nthis arrangement is found very effective. The insulation of the\r\ndriving wheels is very easily effected in either case.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of additional tractive adhesion produced depends upon\r\nthe _quantity_ of current flowing rather than upon its pressure, the\r\nreason for transforming the current as described will be apparent, and\r\nits advantages over a direct current of higher tension and less\r\nquantity, both from an economical and practical standpoint, will for\r\nthis reason be clear. The amount of heat produced at the point of\r\ncontact between the wheels and rails is never large enough to injure\r\nor otherwise affect them, although it may be quite possible to\r\nincrease the current sufficiently to produce a very considerable\r\nheating effect. The amount of current sent through the traction\r\ncircuit will of course vary with the requirements, and as the extent\r\nto which the resistance to slipping may be increased is very great,\r\nthis method is likely to prove of considerable value. While in some\r\ncases the use of such a method of increasing the tractive power of\r\nlocomotives would be confined to ascending gradients and the movement\r\nof exceptionally heavy loads, in others it would prove useful as a\r\n_constant_ factor in the work of transportation. In cases like that of\r\nthe New York elevated railway system, where the traffic during certain\r\nhours is much beyond the capacity of the trains, and the structure\r\nunable to support the weight of heavier engines, a system like that\r\njust described would prove of very great benefit, as it would easily\r\nenable the present engines to draw two or three additional cars with\r\nfar less slipping and lost motion than is the case with mechanical\r\nfriction alone, at a cost for tractive current that is insignificant\r\ncompared to the advantages gained. Other cases may be cited in which\r\nthis method of increasing friction will probably be found useful,\r\naside from its application to railway purposes, but these will\r\nnaturally suggest themselves and need not be further dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the experiments above described, another and somewhat\r\ndifferent method of increasing the traction of railway motors has been\r\ndevised, which is more particularly adapted to electric motors for\r\nstreet railways, and is intended to be used in connection with a\r\nsystem of electric street railways now being developed by the author.\r\nIn this system _electro-magnetism_ provides the means whereby the\r\nincrease in tractive adhesion is produced, and this result is attained\r\nin an entirely novel manner. Several attempts have heretofore been\r\nmade to utilize magnetism for this purpose, but apparently without\r\nsuccess, chiefly because of the crude and imperfect manner in which\r\nmost of these attempts have been carried out.\r\n\r\nThe present system owes its efficiency to the formation of _a complete\r\nand constantly closed magnetic circuit_, moving with the vehicle and\r\ncompleted through the two driving axles, wheels, and that portion of\r\nthe track rails lying between the two pairs of wheels, in a manner\r\nsimilar to that employed in the electrical method before shown. We\r\nhave here a model of a second motor car equipped with the apparatus,\r\nmounted on a section of track and provided with means for measuring\r\nthe amount of tractive force exerted both with and without the passage\r\nof the current.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that each axle of the motor car is wound with a helix\r\nof insulated wire, the helices in the present instance being divided\r\nto permit the attachment to the axles of the motor connections. The\r\nhelices on both axles are so connected that, when energized, they\r\ninduce magnetic lines of force that flow in the same direction through\r\nthe magnetic circuit. There are, therefore, four points at which the\r\ncircuit is maintained closed by the rolling wheels, and as the\r\nresistance to the flow of the lines of force is greatest at these\r\npoints, the magnetic saturation there is more intense, and produces\r\nthe most effective result just where it is most required. Now, when\r\nthe battery circuit is closed through the helices, it will be observed\r\nthat the torque, or pull, exerted by the motor car is fully twice that\r\nexerted by the motor with the traction circuit open, and, by\r\nincreasing the battery current until the saturation point of the iron\r\nis reached, the tractive force is _increased nearly 200 per cent._, as\r\nshown by the dynamometer. A large portion of this resistance to the\r\nslipping or skidding of the driving wheels is undoubtedly due to\r\ndirect magnetic attraction between the wheels and track, this\r\nattraction depending upon the degree of magnetic saturation and the\r\nrelative mass of metal involved.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greatest proportion of the increased friction is purely\r\nthe result of the change in position of the iron molecules due to the\r\nwell known action of magnetism, which causes a direct and close\r\n_interlocking action_, so to speak, between the molecules of the two\r\nsurfaces in contact. This may be illustrated by drawing a very thin\r\nknife blade over the poles of an ordinary electro-magnet, first with\r\nthe current on and then off.\r\n\r\nIn the model before you, the helices are fixed firmly to, and revolve\r\nwith, the axles, the connections being maintained by brushes bearing\r\nupon contact rings at each end of the helices. If desired, however,\r\nthe axles may revolve loosely within the helices, and instead of the\r\nlatter being connected for cumulative effects, they may be arranged in\r\nother ways so as to produce either subsequent or opposing magnetic\r\nforces, leaving certain portions of the circuit neutral and\r\nconcentrating the lines of force wherever they maybe most desirable.\r\nSuch a disposition will prove of advantage in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe amount of current required to obtain this increased adhesion in\r\npractice is extremely small, and may be entirely neglected when\r\ncompared to the great benefits derived. The system is very simple and\r\ninexpensive, and the amount of traction secured is entirely within the\r\ncontrol of the motor man, as in the electric system. It will be seen\r\nthat the car here will not, with the traction circuit open, propel\r\nitself up hill when one end of the track is raised more than 5 inches\r\nabove the table; but with the circuit energized it will readily ascend\r\nthe track as you now see it, with one end about 13½, inches above the\r\nother in a length of three feet, _or the equivalent of a 40 per cent.\r\ngrade_; and this could be increased still further if the motor had\r\npower enough to propel itself against the force of gravity on a\r\nsteeper incline. As you will notice, the motor adheres very firmly to\r\nthe track and requires a considerable push to force it down this 40\r\nper cent. grade, whereas with the traction circuit open it slips down\r\nin very short order, notwithstanding the efforts of the driving\r\nmechanism to propel it up.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the helices on this model is less than two ohms, and\r\nthis will scarcely be exceeded when applied to a full sized car, the\r\ncurrent from two or three cells of secondary batteries being probably\r\nsufficient to energize them.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of the driving axles and wheels is not interfered with\r\nin the slightest, because in the former the axle boxes are outside the\r\npath of the lines of force, and in the case of the latter because each\r\nwheel practically forms a single pole piece, and in revolving presents\r\ncontinuously a new point of contact, of the same polarity, to the\r\nrail; the flow of the lines of force being most intense through the\r\nlower half of the wheels, and on a perpendicular line connecting the\r\ncenter of the axle with the rail. In winter all that is necessary is\r\nto provide each motor car with a suitable brush for cleaning the track\r\nrails sufficiently to enable the wheels to make good contact\r\ntherewith, and any tendency to slipping or skidding may be effectually\r\nchecked. By this means it is easily possible to increase the tractive\r\nadhesion of an ordinary railway motor from 50 to 100 per cent.,\r\nwithout any increase in the load or weight upon the track; for it must\r\nbe remembered that even that portion of the increased friction due to\r\ndirect attraction does not increase the weight upon the roadbed, as\r\nthis attraction is mutual between the wheels and track rails; and if\r\nthis car and track were placed upon a scale and the circuit closed, it\r\nwould not weigh a single ounce more than with the circuit open.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this increase in friction between two moving\r\nsurfaces can also be applied to _check_, as well as augment, the\r\ntractive power of a car or train of cars, and I have shown in\r\nconnection with this model a system of braking that is intended to be\r\nused in conjunction with the electro-magnetic traction system just\r\ndescribed. You will have noticed that in the experiments with the\r\ntraction circuit the brake shoes here have remained idle; that is to\r\nsay, they have not been attracted to the magnetized wheels. This is\r\nbecause a portion of the traction current has been circulating around\r\nthis coil on the iron brake beam, inducing in the brake shoes\r\nmagnetism of like polarity to that in the wheels to which they apply.\r\nThey have therefore been _repelled_ from the wheel tires instead of\r\nbeing attracted to them. Suppose now that it is desired to stop the\r\nmotor car; instead of opening the traction circuit, the current\r\nflowing through the helices is simply reversed by means of this pole\r\nchanging switch, whereupon the axles are magnetized in the opposite\r\ndirection and the brake shoes are instantly drawn to the wheels with a\r\nvery great pressure, as the current in the helices and brake coil now\r\nassist each other in setting up a very strong magnetic flow,\r\nsufficient to bring the motor car almost to an instant stop, if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe same tractive force that has previously been applied to increase\r\nthe tractive adhesion now exercises its influence upon the brake shoes\r\nand wheels, with the result of not only causing a very powerful\r\npressure between the two surfaces due to the magnetic attraction, but\r\noffering an extremely large frictional resistance in virtue of the\r\nmolecular interlocking action before referred to. As shown in the\r\npresent instance, a portion of the current still flows through the\r\ntraction circuit and prevents the skidding of the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe method thus described is equally applicable to increase the\r\ncoefficient of friction in apparatus for the transmission of power,\r\nits chief advantage for this purpose being the ease and facility with\r\nwhich the amount of friction between the wheels can be varied to suit\r\ndifferent requirements, or increased and diminished (either\r\nautomatically or manually) according to the nature of the work being\r\ndone. With soft iron contact surfaces the variation in friction is\r\nvery rapid and sensitive to slight changes in current strength, and\r\nthis fact may prove of value in connection with its application to\r\nregulating and measuring apparatus. In all cases the point to be\r\nobserved is to maintain a closed magnetic circuit of low resistance\r\nthrough the two or more surfaces the friction of which it is desired\r\nto increase, and the same rule holds good with respect to the electric\r\nsystem, except that in the latter case the best effects are obtained\r\nwhen the area of surface in contact is smallest.\r\n\r\nFor large contact areas the magnetic system is found to be most\r\neconomical, and this system might possibly be used to advantage to\r\nprevent slipping of short wire ropes and belts upon their driving\r\npulleys, in cases where longer belts are inapplicable as in the\r\ndriving of dynamos and other machinery. Experiments have also been,\r\nand are still being, made with the object of increasing friction by\r\nmeans of permanent magnetism, and also with a view to _diminishing_\r\nthe friction of revolving and other moving surfaces, the results of\r\nwhich will probably form the subject matter of a subsequent paper.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to indicate that the development of these two\r\nmethods of increasing mechanical friction opens up a new and extensive\r\nfield of operation, and enables electricity to score another important\r\npoint in the present age of progress. The great range and flexibility\r\nof this method peculiarly adapt it to the purposes we have considered\r\nand to numerous others that will doubtless suggest themselves to you.\r\nIts application to the increase of the tractive adhesion of railway\r\nmotors is probably its most prominent and valuable feature at present,\r\nand is calculated to act as an important stimulus to the practical\r\nintroduction of electric railways on our city streets, inasmuch as the\r\nclaims heretofore made for cable traction in this respect are now no\r\nlonger exclusively its own. On trunk line railways the use of sand and\r\nother objectionable traction-increasing appliances will be entirely\r\ndispensed with, and locomotives will be enabled to run at greater\r\nspeed with less slipping of the wheels and less danger of derailment.\r\nTheir tractive power can be nearly doubled without any increase in\r\nweight, enabling them to draw heavier trains and surmount steeper\r\ngrades without imposing additional weight or strain upon bridges and\r\nother parts of the roadbed. Inertia of heavy trains can be more\r\nreadily overcome, loss of time due to slippery tracks obviated, and\r\nthe momentum of the train at full speed almost instantly checked by\r\n_one and the same means_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LAUNCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrials have been made at Havre with an electric launch built to the\r\norder of the French government by the Forges et Chantiers de la\r\nMediterranée. The vessel, which has rather full lines, measures 28 ft.\r\nbetween perpendiculars and 9 ft. beam, and is 5 tons register.\r\n\r\nThe electromotor is the invention of Captain Krebs, who is already\r\nwell known on account of his experiments in connection with navigable\r\nballoons, and of M. De Zédé, naval architect. The propeller shaft is\r\nnot directly coupled with the spindle of the motor, but is geared to\r\nit by spur wheels in the ratio of 1 to 3, in order to allow of the\r\nemployment of a light high-speed motor. The latter makes 850\r\nrevolutions per minute, and develops 12 horse power when driving the\r\nscrew at 280 revolutions. Current is supplied by a new type of\r\naccumulators made by Messrs. Commelin & Desmazures. One hundred and\r\nthirty two of these accumulators are fitted in the bottom of the boat,\r\nthe total weight being about 2 tons.\r\n\r\nIn ordering this boat the French government stipulated a speed of 6\r\nknots to be maintained during three hours with an expenditure of 10\r\nhorse power. The result of the trials gave a speed of 6½ knots during\r\nfive hours with 12 horse power, and sufficient charge was left in the\r\naccumulators to allow the boat to travel on the following day for four\r\nhours. This performance is exceedingly good, since it shows that one\r\nhorse power hour has been obtained with less than 60 lb. of total\r\nweight of battery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE, PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeveling the ground, pulling down old buildings, and distributing\r\nlight and air through her wide streets, Paris is slowly and\r\ncontinuously pursuing her transformation. At this moment it is an\r\nentire district, and not one of the least curious ones, that is\r\ndisappearing, leaving no other trace of its existence than the\r\ncircular walls that once inclosed the wheat market.\r\n\r\nIt is this building that, metamorphosed, is to become the Commercial\r\nExchange that has been so earnestly demanded since 1880 by the\r\ncommerce of Paris. The question, which was simple in the first place,\r\nand consisted in the conversion of the wheat market into a commercial\r\nexchange, became complicated by a project of enlarging the markets. It\r\ntherefore became necessary to take possession, on the one hand, of\r\nsixty seven estates, of a total area of 116,715 square feet, to clear\r\nthe exchange, and, on the other, of 49,965 square feet to clear the\r\ncentral markets. In other words, out of $5,000,000 voted by the common\r\ncouncil for this work, $2,800,000 are devoted to the dispossessions\r\nnecessitated by the new exchange, $1,800,000 to those necessitated by\r\nthe markets, and $400,000 are appropriated to the wheat market.\r\n\r\nThe work of demolition began last spring, and the odd number side of\r\nOrleans street, Deux-Ecus street, from this latter to J.J. Rousseau\r\nstreet, Babille street, Mercier street, and Sortine street, now no\r\nlonger exist. All this part is to-day but a desert, in whose center\r\nstands the iron trussing of the wheat market cupola. It is on these\r\ngrounds that will be laid out the prolongation of Louvre street in a\r\nstraight line to Coquilliere street.\r\n\r\nOur engraving shows the present state of the work. What is seen of the\r\nwheat market will be preserved and utilized by Mr. Blondeau, the\r\narchitect, who has obtained a grant from the commercial exchange to\r\nconstruct two edifices on two plots of an area of 32,220 square feet,\r\nfronting on Louvre street, and which will bring the city an annual\r\nrent of $60,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nAround the rotunda that still exists there was a circular wall 6½ feet\r\nin thickness. Mr. Blondeau has torn this down, and is now building\r\nanother one appropriate to the new destination of the acquired\r\nestates. As for the trussing of the cupola, that is considered as a\r\nwork of art, and care has been taken not to touch it. It was\r\nconstructed at the beginning of this century, at an epoch when nothing\r\nbut rudimentary tools were to be had for working iron, and it was, so\r\nto speak, forged. All the pieces were made with the hammer and were\r\nadded one to the other in succession. This cupola will be glazed at\r\nthe upper part, while the lower part will be covered with zinc. In the\r\ninterior this part will be decorated with allegorical paintings\r\nrepresenting the five divisions of the globe, with their commercial\r\nand industrial attributes. It was feared at one time that the hall, to\r\nwhich admission will be free, would not afford sufficient space, and\r\nthe halls of the Bordeaux and Havre exchanges were cited. It is true\r\nthat the hall of the wheat market has an area of but 11,825 square\r\nfeet, but on utilizing the 5,000 feet of the circular gallery, which\r\nwill not be occupied, it will reach 16,825 feet.\r\n\r\nAs for the tower which stands at one side of the edifice, that was\r\nbuilt by Marie de Medici for the astrologer whom she brought with her\r\nto Paris from Florence. On account of its historic interest, this\r\nstructure will be preserved. On either side of this tower, overlooking\r\nthe roofs of the neighboring dwellings, are perceived the summit of a\r\ntower of St. Eustache church and a campanile of a pavilion of the\r\nmarkets.--_L'Illustration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF COCAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCocaine is manufactured from the dry leaves of the _Erythroxylon\r\ncoca_, which grows in the valleys of the East Cordilleras of South\r\nAmerica--i.e., in the interior of Peru and Bolivia. The fresh leaves\r\ncontain 0.003 to 0.006 per cent of cocaine, which percentage decreases\r\nconsiderably if the leaves are stored any length of time before being\r\nworked up. On the other hand, the alkaloid can be transported and kept\r\nwithout decomposition. This circumstance caused the author to devise a\r\nsimple process for the manufacture of crude cocaine on the spot,\r\nneither Peru nor Bolivia being suitable countries for complicated\r\nchemical operations. After many experiments, he hit upon the following\r\nplan: The disintegrated coca leaves are digested at 70° C. in closed\r\nvessels for two hours, with a very weak solution of sodium hydrate and\r\npetroleum (boiling between 200° and 250° C). The mass is filtered,\r\npressed while still tepid, and the filtrate allowed to stand until the\r\noil has completely separated from the aqueous solution. The oil is\r\ndrawn off and carefully neutralized with very weak hydrochloric acid.\r\nA white bulky precipitate of cocaine hydrochloride is obtained,\r\ntogether with an aqueous solution of the same compound, while the\r\npetroleum is free from the alkaloid and may be used for the extraction\r\nof a fresh batch of leaves. The precipitate is dried, and by\r\nconcentrating the aqueous solution a further quantity of the\r\nhydrochloride is obtained. Both can be shipped without risk of\r\ndecomposition. The product is not quite pure, but contains some\r\nhygrine, traces of gum and other matters. Its percentage of alkaloid\r\nis 75 per cent., while chemically pure cocaine hydrochloride\r\n(C_{17}H_{21}NO_{4}.2HCl) contains 80.6 per cent. of the alkaloid. The\r\nsodium hydrate solution cannot be replaced by milk of lime, nor can\r\nany other acid be used for neutralization. Alcohol or ether are not\r\nsuitable for extraction. A repetition of the process with\r\nonce-extracted coca leaves gave no further quantity of cocaine,\r\nproving that all the cocaine goes into solution by one treatment. The\r\nsame process serves on the small scale for the valuation of coca\r\nleaves. 100 grms. of coca leaves are digested in a flask with 400 c.c.\r\nof water, 50 c.c. of 1/10 NaOH (10 grms. of NaOH in 100 c.c.) and 250\r\nc.c. of petroleum. The flask is loosely covered and warmed on the\r\nwater bath for two hours, shaking it from to time. The mass is then\r\nfiltered, the residue pressed, and the filtrate allowed to separate in\r\ntwo layers. The oil layer is run into a bottle and titrated back with\r\n1/100 HCl (1 grm. of HCl in 100 c.c.) until exactly neutral. The\r\nnumber of c.c. of hydrochloric acid required for titrating back\r\nmultiplied by 0.42 gives the percentage of cocaine in the sample. The\r\nfollowing are some of the results with different samples of coca\r\nleaves of various age:\r\n\r\n                                            Contained per cent.\r\n                                                 of Cocaine.\r\n  Coca leaves from Mapiri, 1 month old             0.5% \\\r\n  \"       \"    \"   Yungas    \"     \"               0.5%  |\r\n  \"       \"    \"   Mapiri and Yungas                     |\r\n                          6 months old             0.4%  |    Of the\r\n  \"       \"    \"   Cuzco (Peru)                          |_ weight of\r\n                          6 months old             0.3%  |   the dry\r\n  \"       \"    \"   Mapiri and Yungas                     |   leaves.\r\n                          1 year old               0.3%  |\r\n  \"      \"     \"   Cuzco  \" \"    \"                 0.2%  |\r\n  \"      \"     \"   Mapiri and Yungas                     |\r\n                          2 years old              0.15%/\r\n\r\nCoca leaves from Yungas and Cuzco, three years old, contained no trace\r\nof the alkaloid, whereas fresh green leaves from Yungas contained 0.7\r\nper cent. of the weight of the dry leaves.

ABBOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe succession of plants from the lower to the higher forms will be\r\nreviewed superficially, and chemical compounds noted where they\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nWhen the germinating spores of the fungi, _myxomycetes_, rupture their\r\nwalls and become masses of naked protoplasm, they are known as\r\nplasmodia. The plasmodium _Æthalium septicum_ occurs in moist places,\r\non heaps of tan or decaying barks. It is a soft, gelatinous mass of\r\nyellowish color, sometimes measuring several inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe plasmodium[2] has been chemically analyzed, though not in a state\r\nof absolute purity. The table of Reinke and Rodewold gives an idea of\r\nits proximate constitution.\r\n\r\nMany of the constituents given are always present in the living cells\r\nof higher plants. It cannot be too emphatically stated that where\r\n\"biotic\" force is manifested, these colloidal or albuminous compounds\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of plant life is an undifferentiated individual, all\r\nof its functions being performed indifferently by all parts of its\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe chemical basis of plasmodium is almost entirely composed of\r\ncomplex albuminous substances, and correlated with this structureless\r\nbody are other compounds derived from them. Aside from the chemical\r\nsubstances which are always present in living matter, and are\r\nessential properties of protoplasm, we find no other compounds. In the\r\nhigher organisms, where these functions are not performed\r\nindifferently, specialization of tissues is accompanied by many other\r\nkinds of bodies.\r\n\r\nThe algæ are a stage higher in the evolutionary scale than the\r\nundifferentiated noncellular plasmodium. The simple _Alga\r\nprotococcus_[3] may be regarded as a simple cell. All higher plants\r\nare masses of cells, varying in form, function, and chemical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA typical living cell may be described as composed of a cell wall and\r\ncontents. The cell wall is a firm, elastic membrane closed on all\r\nsides, and consists mainly of cellulose, water, and inorganic\r\nconstituents. The contents consist of a semi-fluid colloidal\r\nsubstance, lying in contact with the inner surface of the membrane,\r\nand, like it, closed on all sides. This always is composed of\r\nalbuminous substances. In the higher plants, at least, a nucleus\r\noccurs embedded in it; a watery liquid holding salts and saccharine\r\nsubstances in solution fills the space called the vacuole, inclosed by\r\nthe protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThese simple plants may be seen as actively moving cells or as\r\nnon-motile cells. The former consist of a minute mass of protoplasm,\r\ngranular and mostly colored green, but clear and colorless at the more\r\npointed end, and where it is prolonged into two delicate filaments\r\ncalled cilia. After moving actively for a time they come to rest,\r\nacquire a spherical form, and invest themselves with a firm membrane\r\nof cellulose. This firm, outer membrane of the _Protococcus_\r\naccompanies a higher differentiation of tissue and localization of\r\nfunction than is found in the plasmodium.\r\n\r\n_Hæatococcus_ and plasmodium come under the classes algæ and fungi of\r\nthe Thallothyta group. The division[4] of this group into two classes\r\nis based upon the presence of chlorophyl in algæ and its absence in\r\nfungi. Gelatinous starch is found in the algæ; the fungi contain a\r\nstarchy substance called glycogen, which also occurs in the liver and\r\nmuscles of animals. Structureless bodies, as _æthalium_, contain no\r\ntrue sugar. Stratified starch[5] first appears in the phanerogams.\r\nAlkaloids have been found in fungi, and owe their presence doubtless\r\nto the richness of these plants in nitrogenous bodies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the green coloring matter in algæ are found other\r\ncoloring matters.[6] The nature[7] of these coloring matters is\r\nusually the same through whole families, which also resemble each\r\nother in their modes of reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn form, the algæ differ greatly from filaments or masses of cells;\r\nthey live in the water and cover damp surfaces of rocks and wood. In\r\nthese they are remarkable for their ramifications and colors and grow\r\nto a gigantic size.\r\n\r\nThe physiological functions of algæ and fungi depend upon their\r\nchemical differences.\r\n\r\nThese facts have been offered, simple as they are, as striking\r\nexamples of chemical and structural opposition.\r\n\r\nThe fungi include very simple organisms, as well as others of\r\ntolerably high development, of most varied form, from the simple\r\nbacillus and yeast to the truffle, lichens, and mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe cell membrane of this class contains no pure cellulose, but a\r\nmodification called fungus cellulose. The membrane also contains an\r\namyloid substance, amylomycin.[8] Many of the chemical constituents\r\nfound in the entire class are given in _Die Pflanzenstoffe_.[9]\r\n\r\nUnder the _Schizomycetes_ to which the _Micrococcus_ and\r\n_Bacterium_[10] belong are found minute organisms differing much in\r\nform and in the coloring[11] matters they produce, as that causing the\r\nred color of mouldy bread.\r\n\r\nThe class of lichens[12] contains a number of different coloring\r\nsubstances, whose chemical composition has been examined. These\r\nsubstances are found separately in individuals differing in form. In\r\nthe _Polyporus_[13] an acid has been found peculiar to it, as in many\r\nplants special compounds are found. In the agariceæ the different\r\nkinds of vellum distinguish between species, and the color of the\r\nconidia is also of differential importance. In all cases of distinct\r\ncharacteristic habits of reproduction and form, one or more different\r\nchemical compounds is found.\r\n\r\nIn the next group of the musiceæ, or mosses, is an absence of some\r\nchemical compounds that were characteristic of the classes just\r\ndescribed. Many of the albuminous substances are present. Starch[14]\r\nis found often in large quantities, and also oily fats, which are\r\ncontained in the oil bodies of the liverworts; wax,[15] organic acids,\r\nincluding aconitic acid, and tannin, which is found for the first time\r\nat this evolutionary stage of the plant kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe vascular cryptogams are especially characterized by their mineral\r\ncomposition.[16] The ash is extraordinarily rich in silicic acid and\r\nalumina.\r\n\r\n  Equisetum[17]..........silicic acid     60 per cent.\r\n  Aspidium...............  \"     \"        13\r\n  Asplenium..............  \"     \"        35\r\n  Osmunda................  \"     \"        53\r\n  Lycopodium[18].........  \"     \"        14\r\n       \"         ........ alumina   26 to 27\r\n       \"         ........ manganese 2 to 2.5\r\n\r\nThese various plants contain acids and compounds peculiar to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend in the plant scale, we reach the phanerogams. These\r\nplants are characterized by the production of true seeds, and many\r\nchemical compounds not found in lower plants.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient in speaking of these higher groups to follow M.\r\nHeckel's[19] scheme of plant evolution. All these plants are grouped\r\nunder three main divisions: apetalous, monocotyledonous, and\r\ndicotyledonous; and these main divisions are further subdivided.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these three main parallel columns are divided\r\ninto three general horizontal planes.\r\n\r\nOn plane 1 are all plants of simplicity of floral elements, or parts;\r\nfor example, the black walnut, with the simple flower contained in a\r\ncatkin.\r\n\r\nOn plane 2 plants which have a multiplicity of floral elements, as the\r\nmany petals and stamens of the rose; and finally, the higher plants,\r\nthe orchids among the monocotyledons and the composite among the\r\ndicotyledonous plants, come under the third division of condensation\r\nof floral elements.\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to take up in order for chemical consideration\r\nall these groups, and I shall restrict myself to pointing out the\r\noccurrence of certain constituents.\r\n\r\nI desire now to call attention to chemical groups under the apetalous\r\nplants having simplicity of floral elements.\r\n\r\n_Cassuarina equisetifolia_[20] possibly contains tannin, since it is\r\nused for curing hides. The bark contains a dye. It is said to resemble\r\n_Equisetum_[21] in appearance, and in this latter plant a yellow dye\r\nis found.\r\n\r\nThe _Myrica_[22] contains ethereal oil, wax, resin, balsam, in all\r\nparts of the plant. The root contains in addition fats, tannin, and\r\nstarch, also myricinic acid.\r\n\r\nIn the willow and poplar,[23] a crystalline, bitter substance, salicin\r\nor populin, is found. This may be considered as the first appearance\r\nof a real glucoside, if tannin be excluded from the list.\r\n\r\nThe oak, walnut, beech, alder, and birch contain tannin in large\r\nquantities; in the case of the oak, ten to twelve per cent. Oak galls\r\nyield as much as seventy per cent.[24]\r\n\r\nThe numerous genera of pine and fir trees are remarkable for ethereal\r\noil, resin, and camphor.\r\n\r\nThe plane[25] trees contain caoutchouc and gum; peppers,[26] ethereal\r\noils, alkaloids, piperin, white resin, and malic acid. _Datisca\r\ncannabina_[27] contains a coloring matter and another substance\r\npeculiar to itself, datiscin, a kind of starch, or allied to the\r\nglucosides.\r\n\r\nUpon the same evolutionary plane among the monocotyledons, the dates\r\nand palms[28] contain in large quantities special starches, and this\r\nis in harmony with the principles of the theory. Alkaloids and\r\nglucosides have not yet been discovered in them.\r\n\r\nOther monocotyledonous groups with simplicity of floral elements, such\r\nas the typhaceæ, contain large quantities of starch; in the case of\r\n_Typha latifolia_[29] 12.5 per cent., and 1.5 per cent. gum. In the\r\npollen of this same plant, 2.08 per cent. starch has been found.\r\n\r\nUnder the dicotyledonous groups, there are no plants with simplicity\r\nof floral elements.\r\n\r\nReturning, now, to apetalous plants of multiplicity and simplification\r\nof floral elements, we find that the urticaceæ[30] contain free formic\r\nacid; the hemp[31] contains alkaloids; the hop,[32] ethereal oil and\r\nresin; the rhubarb,[33] crysophonic acid; and the begonias,[34]\r\nchicarin and lapacho dyes. The highest apetalous plants contain\r\ncamphors and oils; the highest of the monocotyledons contain a\r\nmucilage and oils; and the highest dicotyledons contain oils and\r\nspecial acids.\r\n\r\nThe trees yielding common camphor and borneol are from genera of the\r\nlauraceæ family; also sassafras camphor is from the same family. Small\r\nquantities of stereoptenes are widely distributed through the plant\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe gramineæ, or grasses, are especially characterized by the large\r\nquantities of sugar and silica they contain. The ash of the rice hull,\r\nfor example, contains ninety eight per cent. silica.\r\n\r\nThe ranunculaceæ contain many plants which yield alkaloids, as\r\n_Hydrastia canadensis_, or Indian hemp, _Helleborus_, _Delphinum_,\r\n_Aconitum_, and the alkaloid berberine has been obtained from genera\r\nof this family.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid[35] furnishing families belong, with few exceptions, to\r\nthe dicotyledons. The colchiceæ, from which is obtained veratrine,\r\nform an exception among the monocotyledons. The alkaloids of the\r\nfungus have already been noted.\r\n\r\n[36]Among the greater number of plant families, no alkaloids have been\r\nfound. In the labiatæ none has been discovered, nor in the compositæ\r\namong the highest plants.\r\n\r\nOne alkaloid is found in many genera of the loganiaceæ; berberine in\r\ngenera of the berberidaceæ, ranunculaceæ, menispermaceæ, rutaceæ,\r\npapaveraceæ, anonaceæ.\r\n\r\nWaxes are widely distributed in plants. They occur in quantities in\r\nsome closely related families.\r\n\r\nEthereal oils occur in many families, in the bark, root, wood, leaf,\r\nflower, and fruit; particularly in myrtaceæ, laurineæ, cyperaceæ,\r\ncrucifereæ, aurantiaceæ, labiatæ, and umbelliferæ.\r\n\r\nResins are found in most of the higher plants. Tropical plants are\r\nricher in resins than those of cold climates.\r\n\r\nChemical resemblance between groups, as indicating morphological\r\nrelations, has been well shown. For example: the similarity[37] of the\r\nviscid juices, and a like taste and smell, among cactaceæ and\r\nportulaceæ, indicate a closer relationship between these two orders\r\nthan botanical classification would perhaps allow. This fact was\r\ncorroborated by the discovery of irritable stamens in _Portulaca_ and\r\n_Opuntia_, and other genera of cactaceæ.\r\n\r\nDarwin[38] states that in the compositæ the ray florets are more\r\npoisonous than the disk florets, in the ratio of about 3 to 2.\r\n\r\nComparing the cycadeæ and palmæ, the former are differently placed by\r\ndifferent botanists, but the general resemblance is remarkable, and\r\nthey both yield sago.\r\n\r\nChemical constituents of plants are found in varying quantities during\r\nstated periods of the year. Certain compounds present at one stage of\r\ngrowth are absent at another. Many facts could be brought forward to\r\nshow the different chemical composition of plants in different stages\r\nof growth. The _Thuja occidentalis_[39] in the juvenescent and adult\r\nform, offers an example where morphological and chemical differences\r\ngo hand in hand. Analyses of this plant under both conditions show a\r\nstriking difference.\r\n\r\nDifferent parts of plants may contain distinct chemical compounds, and\r\nthe comparative chemical study of plant orders comprises the analysis\r\nof all parts of plants of different species.\r\n\r\nFor example; four portions of the _Yucca angustifolia_[40] were\r\nexamined chemically; the bark and wood of the root and the base and\r\nblades of the leaves. Fixed oils were separated from each part. These\r\nwere not identical; two were fluid at ordinary temperature, and two\r\nwere solid. Their melting and solidifying points were not the same.\r\n\r\nThis difference in the physical character and chemical reaction of\r\nthese fixed oils may be due to the presence of free fatty acid and\r\nglycerides in varying proportions in the four parts of the plants. It\r\nis of interest to note that, in the subterranean part of the _Yucca_,\r\nthe oil extracted from the bark is solid at the ordinary temperature;\r\nfrom the wood it was of a less solid consistency; while the yellow\r\nbase of the leaf contained an oil quite soft, and in the green leaf\r\nthe oil is almost fluid.\r\n\r\nTwo new resins were extracted from the yellow and green parts of the\r\nleaf. It was proposed to name them _yuccal_ and _pyrophæal_ An\r\nexamination of the contents of each extract showed a different\r\nquantitative and qualitative result.\r\n\r\nSaponin was found in all parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nMany of the above facts have been collected from the investigations of\r\nothers. I have introduced these statements, selected from a mass of\r\nmaterial, as evidences in favor of the view stated at the beginning of\r\nthis paper.[41] My own study has been directed toward the discovery of\r\nsaponin in those plants where it was presumably to be found. The\r\npractical use of this theory in plant analysis will lead the chemists\r\nat once to a search for those compounds which morphology shows are\r\nprobably present.\r\n\r\nI have discovered saponin in all parts of the _Yucca angustifolia_, in\r\nthe _Y. filimentosa_ and _Y. gloriosa_, in several species of agavæ,\r\nand in plants belonging to the leguminosæ family.\r\n\r\nThe list[42] of plants in which saponin has been discovered is given\r\nin the note. All these plants are contained in the middle plane of\r\nHeckel's scheme. No plants containing saponin have been found among\r\napetalous groups. No plants have been found containing saponin among\r\nthe lower monocotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe plane of saponin passes from the liliaceæ and allied groups to the\r\nrosales and higher dicotyledons.\r\n\r\nSaponin belongs to a class of substances called glucosides. Under the\r\naction of dilute acids, it is split up into two substances, glucose\r\nand sopogenin. The chemical nature of this substance is not thoroughly\r\nunderstood. The commercial[43] product is probably a mixture of\r\nseveral substances.\r\n\r\nThis complexity of chemical composition of saponin is admirably\r\nadapted for the nutrition of the plant, and it is associated with the\r\ncorresponding complexity of the morphological elements of the plant's\r\norgans. According to M. Perrey,[44] it seems that the power of a plant\r\nto direct the distribution of its carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to form\r\ncomplex glucosides is indicative of its higher functions and\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThe solvent action of saponin on resins has been already discussed.\r\nSaponin likewise acts as a solvent upon barium[45] sulphate and\r\ncalcium[46] oxalate, and as a solvent of insoluble or slightly soluble\r\nsalts would assist the plant in obtaining food, otherwise difficult of\r\naccess.\r\n\r\nThe botanical classifications based upon morphology are so frequently\r\nSaponin is found in endogens and exogens. The line dividing these two\r\ngroups is not always clearly defined. Statements pointing to this are\r\nfound in the works of Haeckel, Bentham, and others.\r\n\r\nSmilax belongs to a transition class, partaking somewhat of the nature\r\nof endogen and of exogen. It is worthy of note that this intermediate\r\ngroup of the sarsaparillas should contain saponin.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that all the groups above named containing\r\nsaponin belong to Heckel's middle division.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that saponin is thus a constructive element in\r\ndeveloping the plant from the multiplicity of floral elements to the\r\ncephalization of those organs.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the composite occurs where the materials for\r\ngrowth are supplied in greatest abundance, and the more simple forms\r\narise where sources of nutrition are remote. We may gather from this\r\nfact that the simpler organs of plants low in the evolutionary scale\r\ncontain simpler non-nitrogenous chemical compounds for their\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nThe presence of saponin seems essential to the life of the plant where\r\nit is found, and it is an indispensable principle in the progression\r\nof certain lines of plants, passing from their lower to their higher\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nSaponin is invariably absent where the floral elements are simple; it\r\nis invariably absent where the floral elements are condensed to their\r\ngreatest extent. Its position is plainly that of a factor in the great\r\nmiddle realm of vegetable life, where the elements of the individual\r\nare striving to condense, and thus increase their physiological action\r\nand the economy of parts.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested as a line of research to study what are the\r\nconditions which control the synthesis and gradual formation of\r\nsaponin in plants. The simpler compounds of which this complex\r\nsubstance is built up, if located as compounds of lower plants, would\r\nindicate the lines of progression from the lower to the saponin\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nIn my paper[47] read in Buffalo at the last meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, various suggestions were\r\noffered why chemical compounds should be used as a means of botanical\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe botanical classifications based upon morphology are so frequently\r\nunsatisfactory, that efforts in some directions have been made to\r\nintroduce other methods.[48]\r\n\r\nThere has been comparatively little study of the chemical principles\r\nof plants from a purely botanical view. It promises to become a new\r\nfield of research.\r\n\r\nThe leguminosæ are conspicuous as furnishing us with important dyes,\r\ne.g., indigo, logwood, catechin. The former is obtained principally\r\nfrom different species of the genus _Indigofera_, and logwood from the\r\n_Hæmatoxylon_ and _Saraca indica_.\r\n\r\nThe discovery[49] of hæmatoxylin in the _Saraca indica_ illustrates\r\nvery well how this plant in its chemical, as well as botanical,\r\ncharacter is related to the _Hæmatoxylon campechianum_; also, I found\r\na substance like catechin in the _Saraca_. This compound is found in\r\nthe _acacias_, to which class _Saraca_ is related by its chemical\r\nposition, as well as botanically. Saponin is found in both of these\r\nplants, as well as in many other plants of the leguminosæ. The\r\nleguminosæ come under the middle plane or multiplicity of floral\r\nelements, and the presence of saponin in these plants was to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nFrom many of the facts above stated, it may be inferred that the\r\nchemical compounds of plants do not occur at random. Each stage of\r\ngrowth and development has its own particular chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt is said that many of the constituents found in plants are the\r\nresult of destructive metabolism, and are of no further use in the\r\nplant's economy. This subject is by no means settled, and even should\r\nwe be forced to accept that ground, it is a significant fact that\r\ncertain cells, tissues, or organs peculiar to a plant secrete or\r\nexcrete chemical compounds peculiar to them, which are to be found in\r\none family, or in species closely allied to it.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the chemical compounds are there, no matter why or\r\nwhence they came. They will serve our purposes of study and\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe result of experiment shows that the presence of certain compounds\r\nis essential to the vigor and development of all plants and particular\r\ncompounds to the development of certain plants. Plant chemistry and\r\nmorphology are related. Future investigations will demonstrate this\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, we may say that amides and carbohydrates are\r\nutilized in the manufacture of proteids. Organic acids cause a\r\nturgescence of cells. Glucosides may be a form of reserve food\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nResins and waxes may serve only as protection to the surfaces of\r\nplants; coloring matters, as screens to shut off or admit certain of\r\nthe sun's rays; but we are still far from penetrating the mystery of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nA simple plant does what animals more highly endowed cannot do. From\r\nsimplest substances they manufacture the most complex. We owe our\r\nexistence to plants, as they do theirs to the air and soil.\r\n\r\nThe elements carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen pass through a\r\ncycle of changes from simple inorganic substances to the complex\r\ncompounds of the living cell. Upon the decomposition of these bodies\r\nthe elements return to their original state. During this transition\r\nthose properties of protoplasm which were mentioned at the beginning,\r\nin turn, follow their path. From germination to death this course\r\nappears like a crescent, the other half of the circle closed from\r\nview. Where chemistry begins and ends it is difficult to say.--_Jour.\r\nFr.

ASBOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author maintains that unsatisfactory results are obtained in\r\ndeterminations of starch when the method employed is based upon the\r\ninversion of sugar, formed as an intermediate product, since maltose,\r\ndextrose, and levulose are partly decomposed by boiling with dilute\r\nacids. He proposes to replace the methods hitherto employed by one\r\nwhich depends upon the formation of a barium salt of starch, to which\r\nhe assigns the formula BaO.C_{24}H_{40}O_{20}. This salt is sparingly\r\nsoluble in water and insoluble in dilute alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn making a determination a weighed quantity of starch is saccharified\r\nwith water, then mixed with an excess of normal baryta solution,\r\ndilute alcohol added to make up to a certain volume, and, after the\r\nprecipitate has settled, the excess of baryta is titrated back with\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Titrating apparatus]\r\n\r\nThe author also describes the apparatus he employs for storing and\r\ntitrating with baryta solution. The latter is contained in the bottle,\r\nA, and the drying tube attached to the neck of the same is filled with\r\nquicklime. The burette, B, which is in direct connection with the\r\nbottle, may be filled with the solution by opening the stop cock, and\r\nthe small drying tube, _n_, is filled with dry KOH, thus preventing\r\nthe entrance of any CO_{2}. Numbers are appended which seem to testify\r\nto the excellence of the method employed. The author finally gives a\r\ndetailed account of the entire analysis of various cereals.--_A.R. in\r\nJour.

Most of our knowledge, as we now have it, regarding such\r\nalkaloids as muscarine and choline has been acquired during the past\r\ndozen years. This is not exactly the case with the higher groups of\r\nalkaloids--the derivatives of pyridine and quinoline. It so happens\r\nthat the oldest alkaloids are in these groups. They have, almost\r\nnecessarily, been subjected to a longer period of attack, but the\r\nextreme complexity of their molecules, and the infinite number of\r\ndiffering parts or substances into which these molecules split up when\r\nattacked, are the main cause of the small progress which has been made\r\nin this department. All, however, yield one or more bodies or bases in\r\ncommon, while each has its distinctive and peculiar decomposition\r\nproduct. For example, cinchonine and quinine both afford the basic\r\nquinoline under certain conditions, but on oxidation of cinchonine, an\r\nacid--cinchoninic acid (C_{10}H_{7}NO_{2})--is the principal body\r\nformed, while in the case of quinine, quininic acid (C_{10}H_{9}NO_{3})\r\nis the principal product. The acquirement through experiment of such\r\nknowledge as that is, however, so much gained. We find, indeed, that\r\nobstacles are gradually being cleared away, and the actual synthetic\r\nformation of such alkaloids as piperidine and coniine is a proof that\r\nthe chemist is on the right track in studying the decomposition\r\nproducts, and building up from them, theoretically, bodies of similar\r\nconstitution. It is noteworthy that the synthesis of the alkaloids has\r\nled to some of the most brilliant discoveries of the present day,\r\nespecially in the discovery of dye stuffs. Many of our quinine\r\nsubstitutes, such as thalline, for example, are the result of\r\nendeavors to make quinine artificially. If there is romance in\r\nchemistry at all, it is to be found certainly in this branch of it,\r\nwhich is generally considered the most uninteresting and unfathomable.\r\nWe may take piperidine and coniine as examples of the methods followed\r\nin alkaloidal synthesis; these are pyridine bases. Pyridine has the\r\nformula C_{5}H_{5}N, that is, it is benzene with CH replaced by N. The\r\nrelationship between these and piperidine is seen in the following\r\nformulæ:\r\n\r\n       CH            N                NH\r\n      /  \\          /  \\             /  \\\r\n    HC    CH      HC    CH     H_{2}C    CH_{2}\r\n     |    |        |    |           |    |\r\n    HC    CH      HC    CH     H_{2}C    CH_{2}\r\n      \\  /          \\  /             \\  /\r\n       CH            CH               CH_{2}\r\n\r\n    (Benzene,)    (Pyridine,)    (Piperidine,)\r\n    (C_{6}H_{6})  (C_{5}H_{5}N)  (C_{5}H_{11}N)\r\n\r\nIf we introduce six hydrogen atoms into pyridine, we convert it into\r\npiperidine. Ladenburg succeeded in so hydrogenizing pyridine by acting\r\nupon an alcoholic solution with sodium, and from the base which was\r\nformed he obtained a platinochloride which agreed with the similar\r\ndouble salt of piperidine. He has also prepared it from trimethyline\r\ncyanide by the action of sodium. Pentamethylinediamine is the\r\nprincipal intermediary product, and this gives piperidine when\r\ndistilled with superheated steam. He has proved that the alkaloid so\r\nobtained is identical with that prepared from piperine. Another\r\ncurious point which Ladenburg has lately proved is that cadaverine\r\n(one of the products of flesh decomposition) is identical with\r\npentamethylinediamine, and that its imine is the same as piperidine.\r\nThe synthesis of coniine by Ladenburg is one of the most notable\r\nachievements of modern chemistry. He at first supposed that this\r\nalkaloid was piperidine in which two hydrogen atoms were replaced by\r\nthe isopropyl radical (C_{3}H_{7}), its formula being taken as\r\nC_{5}H_{9}(C_{3}H_{7})NH. But he has since changed his view, as will\r\nbe seen from what follows. In its synthesis 1,000 grammes of picoline\r\nwere first converted into alphapicoline, 380 grammes being obtained.\r\nThis was heated with paraldehyde, whereby it was converted into\r\nallylpyridine (48 grammes), and this by reduction with sodium yielded\r\nalpha-propylpyridine, a body in almost every respect identical with\r\nconiine. The more important difference was its optical inactivity, but\r\nhe succeeded in splitting up a solution of the acid tartrate of the\r\nbase by means of _Penicillium glaucum_. Crystals separated which had a\r\ndextro-rotatory power of [_a_]_{D} = 31° 87' as compared with the\r\n[_a_]_{D} = 13° 79' of natural coniine. This brief account conveys but\r\na faint idea of the difficulties which were encountered in these\r\nresearches. Optical methods of examination have proved of great value,\r\nand are destined to play an important part in such work.\r\n\r\nAmong the most complex alkaloids are those of the quinine group. As\r\nyet chemists have got no further with these than the oxidation\r\nproducts; but the study has afforded us several new antipyretics and\r\nmany interesting facts. It has been found, for example, that\r\nartificial quinine-like bodies, which fluoresce and give the green\r\ncolor with chlorine water and ammonia, have antipyretic properties\r\nlike quinine, but their secondary effects are so pernicious as to\r\nprevent their use. If, however, such bodies are hydrogenized or\r\nmethylated they lose their fluorescing property, do not give the green\r\ncolor, and their secondary effects are removed. Knowledge of these\r\nfacts led to the discovery of thalline. It is prepared from\r\nparaquinanisol, one of the objectionable bodies, by reduction with tin\r\nand hydrochloric acid. The following formulæ show the constitutional\r\nrelationship of these compounds:\r\n\r\n               CH   CH                  CH   CH_{2}\r\n              /  \\ /  \\                /  \\ /  \\\r\n    (CH_{3}O)C    C    CH    (CH_{3}O)C    C    CH_{2}\r\n             |    |    |              |    |    |\r\n            HC    C    CH            HC    C    CH_{2}\r\n              \\  / \\  /                \\  / \\  /\r\n               CH   N                   CH   NH\r\n\r\n            Paraquinanisol              Thalline\r\n          C_{9}H_{6}.CH_{3}.NO.

From time immemorial the\r\nSouth Downs had dark brown or black legs, matured early, produced the\r\nbest of mutton and a fine quality of medium wool. The original\r\nHampshire was larger, coarser, but hardier, slower to mature, with\r\ninferior flesh, and a longer but coarser wool. The South Down has\r\nalways been remarkable for its power of transmitting its special\r\ncharacteristics to its progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it\r\nsoon impressed its own characteristics on its progeny by the\r\nHampshire. The horns of the original breed have disappeared; the face\r\nand legs have become dark, the frame has become more compact, the\r\nbones smaller, the back broader and straighter, the legs shorter, and\r\nthe flesh and wool of better quality, while the superior hardiness and\r\ngreater size, as well as the large head and Roman nose of the old\r\nbreed, still remain. The Hampshires of to-day mature early and fatten\r\nreadily. They clip from six to seven pounds of wool, suitable for\r\ncombing, which is longer than South Down wool, but less fine. The\r\nmutton has a desirable proportion of fat and lean, and is juicy and\r\nfine flavored. The lambs are of large size and are usually dropped\r\nearly and fed for market. Indeed, the Hampshire may be considered a\r\nlarger and trifle coarser and hardier South Down. The breed is\r\noccasionally crossed with Cotswolds, when it produces a wool more\r\nvaluable for worsted manufacturers than the pure Cotswold. Indeed,\r\nthere is little doubt that in addition to South Down, the Hampshire\r\nhas a dash of Cotswold blood in its composition. Considerable\r\nimportations of the breed have been made into this country, but it has\r\nnot become so popular as the South Down and some other English breeds.\r\nThe excellent group shown is owned by Mr. James Wood, of Mount Kisco,\r\nNew York.--_Rural New-Yorker._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YALE COLLEGE MEASUREMENT OF THE PLEIADES.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: \"Determination of the Relative Positions of the\r\n  Principal Stars in the Group of the Pleiades.\" By William L.\r\n  Elkin. Transactions of the Astronomical Observatory of Yale\r\n  University, Vol. I., Part I. (New Haven: 1887.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Repsold have established, and for the present seem likely\r\nto maintain, a practical monopoly in the construction of heliometers.\r\nThat completed by them for the observatory of Yale College in 1882\r\nleaves so little to be desired as to show excellence not to be the\r\nexclusive result of competition. In mere size it does not indeed take\r\nthe highest rank. Its aperture is of only six inches, while that of\r\nthe Oxford heliometer is of seven and a half; but the perfection of\r\nthe arrangements adapting it to the twofold function of equatorial and\r\nmicrometer stamps it as a model not easy to be surpassed. Steel has\r\nbeen almost exclusively used in the mounting. Recommended as the\r\nmaterial for the objective cell by its quality of changing volume\r\nunder variations of temperature nearly _paripassu_ with glass, its\r\nemployment was extended to the telescope tube and other portions of\r\nthe mechanism. The optical part of the work was done by Merz, Alvan\r\nClark having declined the responsibility of dividing the object lens.\r\nIts segments are separable to the extent of 2°, and through the\r\ncontrivance of cylindrical slides (originally suggested by Bessel)\r\nperfect definition is preserved in all positions, giving a range of\r\naccurate measurement just six times that with a filar micrometer.\r\n(Gill, \"Encyc. Brit.,\" vol. xvi., p. 253; Fischer, _Sirius_, vol.\r\nxvii., p. 145.)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful engine of research was in 1883 placed in the already\r\npracticed and skillful hands of Dr. Elkin. He lost no time in fixing\r\nupon a task suited both to test the powers of the new instrument and\r\nto employ them to the highest advantage.\r\n\r\nThe stars of the Pleiades have, from the earliest times, attracted the\r\nspecial notice of observers, whether savage or civilized. Hence, on\r\nthe one hand, their prominence in stellar mythology all over the\r\nworld; on the other, their unique interest for purposes of scientific\r\nstudy and comparison. They constitute an undoubted cluster; that is to\r\nsay, they are really, and not simply in appearance, grouped together\r\nin space, so as to fall under the sway of prevailing mutual\r\ninfluences. And since there is, perhaps, no other stellar cluster so\r\nnear the sun, the chance of perceptible displacements among them in a\r\nmoderate lapse of time is greater than in any other similar case.\r\nAuthentic data regarding them, besides, have now been so long garnered\r\nthat their fruit may confidently be expected at least to begin to\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nDr. Elkin determined, accordingly, to repeat the survey of the\r\nPleiades executed by Bessel at Konigsberg during about twelve years\r\nprevious to 1841. Wolf and Pritchard had, it is true, been beforehand\r\nwith him; but the wide scattering of the grouped stars puts the filar\r\nmicrometer at a disadvantage in measuring them, producing minute\r\nerrors which the arduous conditions of the problem render of serious\r\naccount. The heliometer, there can be no doubt, is the special\r\ninstrument for the purpose, and it was, moreover, that employed by\r\nBessel; so that the Konigsberg and Yale results are comparable in a\r\nstricter sense than any others so far obtained.\r\n\r\nOne of Bessel's fifty-three stars was omitted by Dr. Elkin as too\r\nfaint for accurate determination. He added, however, seventeen stars\r\nfrom the Bonn _Durchmusterung_, so that his list comprised sixty-nine,\r\ndown to 9.2 magnitude. Two independent triangulations were executed by\r\nhim in 1884-85. For the first, four stars situated near the outskirts\r\nof the group, and marking the angles of quadrilateral by which it was\r\ninclosed, were chosen as reference points. The second rested upon\r\nmeasures of distance and position angle outward from Alcyone ([eta]\r\nTauri). Thus, two wholly unconnected sets of positions were secured,\r\nthe close accordance of which testified strongly to the high quality\r\nof the entire work. They were combined, with nearly equal weights, in\r\nthe final results. A fresh reduction of the Konigsberg observations,\r\nnecessitated by recent improvements in the value of some of the\r\ncorrections employed, was the preliminary to their comparison with\r\nthose made, after an interval of forty-five years, at Yale College.\r\nThe conclusions thus laboriously arrived at are not devoid of\r\nsignificance, and appear perfectly secure, so far as they go.\r\n\r\nIt has been known for some time that the stars of the Pleiades possess\r\na small identical proper motion. Its direction, as ascertained by\r\nNewcomb in 1878, is about south-southeast; its amount is somewhat less\r\nthan six seconds of arc in a century. The double star 61 Cygni, in\r\nfact, is displaced very nearly as much in one year as Alcyone with its\r\ntrain in one hundred. Nor is there much probability that this slow\r\nsecular shifting is other than apparent; since it pretty accurately\r\nreverses the course of the sun's translation through space, it may be\r\npresumed that the _backward_ current of movement in which the Pleiades\r\nseem to float is purely an effect of our own _onward_ traveling.\r\n\r\nNow the curious fact emerges from Dr. Elkin's inquiries that six of\r\nBessel's stars are exempt from the general drift of the group. They\r\nare being progressively left behind. The inference is obvious that\r\nthey do not in reality belong to, but are merely accidentally\r\nprojected upon, it; or, rather, that it is projected upon them; for\r\ntheir apparent immobility (which, in two of the six, may be called\r\nabsolute) shows them with tolerable certainty to be indefinitely more\r\nremote--so remote that the path, moderately estimated at\r\n21,000,000,000 miles in length, traversed by the solar system during\r\nthe forty-five years elapsed since the Konigsberg measures dwindles\r\ninto visual insensibility when beheld from them. The brightest of\r\nthese six far-off stars is just above the eighth (7.9) magnitude; the\r\nothers range from 8.5 down to below the ninth.\r\n\r\nA chart of the relative displacements indicated for Bessel's stars by\r\nthe differences in their inter-mutual positions as determined at\r\nKonigsberg and Yale accompanies the paper before us. Divergences\r\nexceeding 0.40\" (taken as the limit of probable error) are regarded as\r\ndue to real motion; and this is the case with twenty-six stars besides\r\nthe half dozen already mentioned as destined deserters from the group.\r\nWith these last may be associated two stars surmised, for an opposite\r\nreason, to stand aloof from it. Instead of tarrying behind, they are\r\nhurrying on in front.\r\n\r\nAn excess of the proper movement of their companions belongs to them;\r\nand since that movement is presumably an effect of secular parallax,\r\nwe are justified in inferring their possession of an extra share of it\r\nto signify their greater proximity to the sun. Hence, of all the stars\r\nin the Pleiades these are the most likely to have a measurable annual\r\nparallax. One is a star a little above the seventh magnitude,\r\ndistinguished as _s_ Pleiadum; the other, of about the eighth, is\r\nnumbered 25 in Bessel's list. Dr. Elkin has not omitted to remark that\r\nthe conjecture of their disconnection from the cluster is confirmed by\r\nthe circumstance that its typical spectrum (as shown on Prof.\r\nPickering's plates) is varied in _s_ by the marked character of the K\r\nline. The spectrum of its fellow traveler (No. 25) is still\r\nundetermined.\r\n\r\nIt is improbable, however, that even these nearer stars are\r\npracticable subjects for the direct determination of annual parallax.\r\nBy indirect means, however, we can obtain some idea of their distance.\r\nAll that we want to know for the purpose is the _rate_ of the sun's\r\nmotion; its _direction_ we may consider as given with approximate\r\naccuracy by Airy's investigation. Now, spectroscopic measurements of\r\nstellar movements of approach and recession will eventually afford\r\nample materials from which to deduce the solar, velocity; though they\r\nare as yet not accurate or numerous enough to found any definitive\r\nconclusion upon. Nevertheless, M. Homann's preliminary result of\r\nfifteen miles a second as the speed with which our system travels in\r\nits vast orbit inspires confidence both from the trustworthiness of\r\nthe determinations (Mr. Seabroke's) serving as its basis and from its\r\nintrinsic probability. Accepting it provisionally, we find the\r\nparallax of Alcyone = about 0.02', implying a distance of\r\n954,000,000,000,000 miles and a light journey of 163 years. It is\r\nassumed that the whole of its proper motion of 2.61' in forty-five\r\nyears is the visual projection of oar own movement toward a point in\r\nR.A. 261°, Decl. +25°.\r\n\r\nThus the parallax of the two stars which we suspect to lie between us\r\nand the stars forming the genuine group of the Pleiades, at perhaps\r\ntwo-thirds of their distance, can hardly exceed 0.03'. This is just\r\nhalf that found by Dr. Gill for [xi] Toucani, which may be regarded\r\nas, up to this, the smallest annual displacement at all satisfactorily\r\ndetermined. And the error of the present estimate is more likely to be\r\non the side of excess than of defect. That is, the stars in question\r\ncan hardly be much nearer to us than is implied by an annual parallax\r\nof 0.03\", and they may be considerably more remote.\r\n\r\nDr. Elkin concludes, from the minuteness of the detected changes of\r\nposition among the Pleiades, that \"the hopes of obtaining any clew to\r\nthe internal mechanism of this cluster seem not likely to be realized\r\nin an immediate future;\" remarking further: \"The bright stars in\r\nespecial seem to form an almost rigid system, as for only one is there\r\nreally much evidence of motion, and in this case the total amount is\r\nbarely 1 per century.\" This one mobile member of the naked eye group\r\nis Electra; and it is noticeable that the apparent direction of its\r\ndisplacement favors the hypothesis of leisurely orbital circulation\r\nround the leading star. The larger movements, however, ascribed to\r\nsome of the fainter associated stars are far from harmonizing with\r\nthis preconceived notion of what they ought to be.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, so far as they are known at present, they force upon\r\nour minds the idea that the cluster may be undergoing some slow\r\nprocess of disintegration. M. Wolf's impression of incipient\r\ncentrifugal tendencies among its components certainly derives some\r\nconfirmation from Dr. Elkin's chart. Divergent movements are the most\r\nstrongly marked; and the region round Alcyone suggests, at the first\r\nglance, rather a very confused area of radiation for a flight of\r\nmeteors than the central seat of attraction of a revolving throng of\r\nsuns.\r\n\r\nThere are many signs, however, that adjacent stars in the cluster do\r\nnot pursue independent courses. \"Community of drift\" is visible in\r\nmany distinct sets; while there is as yet no perceptible evidence,\r\nfrom orbital motion, of association into subordinate systems. The\r\nthree eighth-magnitude stars, for instance, arranged in a small\r\nisosceles triangle near Alcyone, do not, as might have been expected\r\n_a priori_, constitute a real ternary group. They are all apparently\r\ntraveling directly away from the large star close by them, in straight\r\nlines which may, of course, be the projections of closed curves; but\r\ntheir rates of travel are so different as to involve certain\r\nprogressive separation. Obviously, the order and method of such\r\nmovements as are just beginning to develop to our apprehension among\r\nthe Pleiades will not prove easy to divine.--_A.M.

BRUCE WARREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe Prof. Ehrenberg was one of the first to examine,\r\nmicroscopically, deep sea dredgings, some of which were undertaken for\r\nthe Atlantic cable expedition, 1857.\r\n\r\nI propose to deal with the bottoms brought up from tropical waters of\r\nthe Atlantic, a few years ago, during certain telegraph cable\r\noperations. These soundings were made for survey purposes, and not for\r\nany biological or chemical investigations. Still I think that this\r\nimperfect record may be a useful contribution to chemical science,\r\nbearing especially on marine operations.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is little to be added to the chemistry of this subject,\r\nstill I think there are few chemists who could successfully make an\r\nanalysis of a deep sea \"bottom\" without some sacrifice of time and\r\npatience, to say nothing of the risk of wasting a valuable specimen.\r\n\r\nThe muds, clays, oozes, etc., from deep water are so very fine that\r\nthey pass readily through the best kinds of filters, and it is\r\nnecessary to wash out all traces of sea water as a preliminary. The\r\nspecimen must be _repeatedly_ washed by decantation, until the\r\nwashings are perfectly free from chlorine, when the whole may be\r\nthrown onto a filter _merely_ to drain. The turbid water which passes\r\nthrough is allowed to stand so that the suspended matter may settle,\r\nand after decanting the clear supernatant water, the residuum is again\r\nthrown on to the filter.\r\n\r\nThe washing and getting ready for the drying oven will, in some cases,\r\nrequire days to carry out, if we wish to avoid losing anything.\r\n\r\nSo far the proceeding is exactly the same, except draining on a\r\nfilter, which would be adopted for preparing for the microscope. On no\r\naccount should the opportunity be missed of mounting several slides\r\npermanently for microscopic examination. Drawings or photographic\r\nenlargements will render us independent of direct microscopic appeal,\r\nwhich is not at all times convenient.\r\n\r\nThe substance, if drained and allowed to dry on the filter, will\r\nadhere most tenaciously to it, so that it is better to complete the\r\ndrying in a porcelain or platinum capsule, either by swilling the\r\nfilter with a jet of water or by carefully removing with a spatula.\r\nThe most strenuous care must be used not to contaminate the specimen\r\nwith loose fibers from the filter.\r\n\r\nThe perfectly dried matter is best treated in exactly the same way as a\r\nresiduum in water analysis. It is a common thing to ignite the residuum,\r\nand to put the loss down, if any, to water. This ought not to satisfy an\r\naccurate observer, since organic matter, carbonates--especially in\r\npresence of silica--will easily add to the loss. The best plan is to\r\nheat a small portion very cautiously, and note if any smell or\r\nalteration in color, due to carbon, etc., is perceptible, and to proceed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nI have seen some very satisfactory analyses made on board ship by a\r\nskillful use of the blowpipe, where liquid reagents would be very\r\ninconvenient to employ.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to say a few words as to the way in which\r\nsoundings are made at sea. When the bottom consists of sand, mud, or\r\nother loose matter, it is easy enough to bring specimens to the\r\nsurface, and, of course, we know in such a case that the bottom has\r\nbeen reached, but, in the event of the bottom being hard and rocky, it\r\nis not easy to say that our sounding has been successful: and here we\r\nmeet with a difficulty which unfortunately is most unsatisfactorily\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nThe lead is \"cast,\" as the saying goes, \"armed\" for this emergency. An\r\niron sinker is made with a hollow recess in the bottom; this is filled\r\nin with tallow, and on striking the bottom any loose matter may adhere\r\nby being pressed into the tallow. If the bottom is rocky or hard we\r\nget simply an imprint in the arming, and when such a result is\r\nobtained the usual construction is that \"the bottom is rocky\" or hard.\r\n\r\nNow, this seems to me a point on which chemistry may give some very\r\nvaluable help, for I am convinced that no sounding should be accepted\r\nunless evidence of the bottom itself is obtained. A few considerations\r\nwill show that when we are working in very deep water, where there is\r\na difficulty of knowing for certain that we have an \"up and down\"\r\nsounding, and the hardening of the \"arming\" by the cold and pressure,\r\nunless we bring up something we cannot be sure that we have touched\r\nthe bottom; leaving the doubt on this point on one side, unless we use\r\na very heavy sinker, so as to get an indication of the released strain\r\nwhen it touches the bottom, we encounter another complication.\r\n\r\nSir William Thomson's sounding wire has added the element of\r\nreliability to our soundings in this latter case. The note given out\r\nby the wire when the bottom is reached is perceptibly different when\r\nunder strain, even if the dynamometer should give an unreliable\r\nindication.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that when a \"bottom\" has been recovered by the\r\narming with tallow, the adherent grease seriously detracts from the\r\nvalue of the specimen for scientific purposes. Washing with perfectly\r\npure bisulphide carbon will save the sounding, but of course any\r\nliving organism is destroyed. As we have plenty of contrivances for\r\nbringing up loose \"bottoms\" without arming, we have nothing to fear on\r\nthis score.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difficulty to explain the vast accumulations of clay\r\ndeposits on the ocean bed, and it has been suggested that some minute\r\norganisms may produce these deposits, as others give us carbonate of\r\nlime. Is there not a very great probability of some of the apparently\r\ninsoluble rocky formations being answerable for these accumulations?\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the peculiar changes which such an apparently\r\nstable substance as feldspar undergoes when disintegrated and exposed\r\nto the chemical action of sea water. As these deposits contain both\r\nsodium and potassium, our chemical operations must provide for the\r\nanalytical results; in other respects the analysis can be proceeded\r\nwith according to the operator's analytical knowledge.\r\n\r\nFew operators are aware of the usefulness of an ordinary deep sea\r\ngrapnel rope, as used for cable work, in recovering specimens of the\r\nfauna of any locality. The grapnel rope should be left down for a few\r\nmonths, so that the denizens of the deep may get used to it and make\r\nit their place of residence and _attachment_. The stench caused by\r\ntheir decomposition, unless the rope be kept in water, when hauled up\r\nwill be in a few days intolerable, even to an individual with a\r\nsea-going stomach. I tried several chemical solutions for preserving\r\nspecimens thus recovered, but nothing answered so well as the water\r\nitself drawn up from the same depth as the rope was recovered\r\nfrom.--_Chem.
