What can be more refreshing or\r\ninvigorating than the showers of spring?  When the snows of February have\r\ndisappeared, and the blustering winds of March have performed their\r\noffice of drying up the excess of moisture, and preparing the earth for\r\nfruitfulness, and when the young buds and blossoms of April are peeping\r\nforth beneath the influence of the sun, and the trees and hedges are\r\nattired in their new robes of tender green, how soon would all this\r\nbeauty languish but for the showers of spring!  Several dry days,\r\nperhaps, have passed, and the wreaths of dust which are raised by the\r\nwind show that the earth wants moisture; but before a drop falls there is\r\na general lull throughout all nature; not a leaf is heard to rustle; the\r\nbirds are mute and the cattle stand in expectation of the refreshing\r\nfall.  At last the pools and rivulets are \"dimpled\" by a few soft drops,\r\nthe forerunners of the general shower.  And this shower, unlike the\r\nheavier rains of summer, comes stealing on so gently, that the tinkling\r\nsound of its fall is heard among the branches of the bursting trees long\r\nbefore it is felt by those who walk beneath their slight shelter.\r\nRapidly does the landscape brighten under the influence of the welcome\r\nshower; and as it becomes more rich and extensive, all nature seems to\r\nrise up and rejoice.  The birds chirp merrily among the foliage; the\r\nflowers raise their drooping heads, and the thirsty ground drinks in with\r\neager haste the mellowing rains.  All day long, perhaps, does the rain\r\ncontinue to fall, until the earth is fully moistened and \"enriched with\r\nvegetable life.\"  At length, towards evening, the sun peeps out from\r\namong the broken clouds, and lights up, by his sudden radiance, the\r\nlovely scene.  Myriads of rain-drops sparkle like gems beneath his beams;\r\na soft mist that seems to mingle earth and sky gradually rolls away, and\r\n\"moist, and bright, and green, the landscape laughs around.\"  Now pours\r\nforth the evening concert from the woods, while warbling brooks, and\r\nlowing herds, appear to answer to the sound.  Such are some of the\r\ndelightful effects of spring-showers.\r\n\r\nIn summer, when the heat has been very great, the rain is often ushered\r\nin by a thunder-storm, and falls in torrents, which at an earlier season\r\nwould do harm to the young buds and blossoms of spring; but now the\r\nvegetation is strong enough to resist the floods so necessary to maintain\r\nmoisture in the parched earth.  But when the summer has been moderately\r\nwarm some gentle rains generally fall about midsummer, which, from the\r\nfrequency of their occurrence about this time, have obtained the name of\r\n\"Midsummer rains.\"  These rains are popularly associated with St.\r\nSwithin's Day, as will be noticed in another chapter; but when they fall\r\nearly, mildly, and in moderate quantity, they operate to a certain extent\r\nas a second spring.  \"Many of the birds come into song and have second\r\nbroods; and it is probable that there is a fresh production of\r\ncaterpillars for their food, or, at all events, a larger production of\r\nthe late ones than when the rains are more violent and protracted.  Many\r\nof the herbaceous plants also bloom anew, and the autumn is long and\r\npleasant, and has very many of the charms of a summer, though without any\r\nvery powerful operation on the productions of nature, further than a very\r\nexcellent preparation for the coming year, whether in buds, in roots, or\r\nin the labours of man.  Such a season is also one of plenty, or at all\r\nevents of excellent quality in all the productions of the soil.  The wild\r\nanimals partake in the general abundance, as that food which is left for\r\nthem in the fields, after man has gathered in his share, is both more\r\nabundant and more nourishing.  When there is much moisture from the\r\nprotracted time and great quantity of the rains, many of those seeds\r\ngerminate, while in mild seasons they are left as food for the wild\r\nanimals, chiefly the field-mice and the birds, which again form part of\r\nthe food of the predatory ones.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something melancholy and depressing in the rains of autumn and\r\nwinter, for they bear away the last traces of summer by stripping the\r\ntrees of the many-coloured leaves, which in mild seasons will continue to\r\nadorn the landscape even late in November.  The rains of this month, and\r\ntheir effects, have been skilfully sketched by an accurate observer of\r\nnature.  He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now cold rains come deluging down, till the drenched ground, the\r\n    dripping trees, the pouring eaves, and the torn, ragged-skirted\r\n    clouds, seemingly dragged downward slantwise by the threads of dusky\r\n    rain that descend from them, are all mingled together in one blind\r\n    confusion; while the few cattle that are left in open pastures,\r\n    forgetful of their till now interminable business of feeding, turn\r\n    their backs upon the besieging storm, and, hanging down their heads\r\n    till their noses almost touch the ground, stand out in the middle of\r\n    the fields motionless, like dead images.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, too, a single rain-storm, like the above, breaks up all the\r\n    paths and ways at once, and makes home no longer 'home' to those who\r\n    are not obliged to leave it; while it becomes doubly endeared to\r\n    those who are.  What sight, for instance, is so pleasant to the\r\n    wearied woodman, who has been out all day long in the drenching rains\r\n    of this month, as his own distant cottage window seen through the\r\n    thickening dusk, lighted up by the blazing fagot that is to greet his\r\n    sure return at the accustomed minute?\"\r\n\r\nWhile we watch the effects of the various rains, and their beneficial\r\ninfluence on the earth, there is also much to excite our gratitude and\r\nadmiration; for among the many beautiful contrivances in creation, none\r\nis more remarkable than the means by which the earth is watered and\r\nrefreshed by rain.  The oceans, seas, lakes, and other waters of the\r\nearth supply the air with moisture, which, rendered elastic and invisible\r\nby the heat of the sun and of the earth, rises to various heights in the\r\natmosphere, where it forms clouds in all their wonderful beauty and\r\nvariety.  These are borne by the winds to places far inland, to which\r\nwater in sufficient quantity could not come by any other means, and where\r\nmoisture is most required; and here the water is poured down, not in\r\ncataracts and water-spouts, but in the form of drops of various sizes.\r\nIf the rain-clouds threw down, at once and suddenly, all the water\r\ncontained in them, not only would vegetation be destroyed by the force of\r\nthe fall, but we should be constantly liable to floods and other\r\ninconveniences.  Clouds also serve to screen the earth from the fierce\r\nheat of the sun by day; and, by night, they serve to maintain the heat\r\nwhich would otherwise escape by radiation, and produce great cold even in\r\nsummer.  Clouds thus have great influence in regulating the extremes of\r\nheat and cold, and in forming what is called the \"climate\" of a country.\r\nClouds also supply the hidden stores of fountains and the fresh water of\r\nrivers; and, as a pious old divine well remarks, \"So abundant is this\r\ngreat blessing, which the most indulgent Creator hath afforded us by\r\nmeans of this distribution of the waters I am speaking of, that there is\r\nmore than a scanty, bare provision, a mere sufficiency; even a plenty, a\r\nsurplusage of this useful creature of God, the fresh waters afforded to\r\nthe world; and they so well ordered, as not to drown the nations of the\r\nearth, nor to stagnate, stink, and poison, or annoy them; but to be\r\ngently carried through convenient channels back again to their grand\r\nfountain the sea; and many of them through such large tracts of land and\r\nto such prodigious distances, that it is a great wonder the fountains\r\nshould be high enough, or the seas low enough, ever to afford so long a\r\nconveyance.\" {18}\r\n\r\nIf rain is not at all seasons pleasant and delightful, neither are\r\nrain-clouds among the most beautiful which diversify the landscape of the\r\nsky; for it has been well remarked, that \"all the fine-weather clouds are\r\nbeautiful, and those connected with rain and wind mostly the reverse.\"\r\nWhat, indeed, can be more striking than the aerial landscapes of fine\r\nweather, in which, by an easy fancy, we can trace trees and towers,\r\nmagnificent ruins and glaciers, natural bridges and palaces, all dashed\r\nwith torrents of light or frowning in shadow, glowing like burnished\r\nsilver, glittering in a golden light, or melting into the most enchanting\r\nhues?  But with all this beauty the eye is seldom capable of judging\r\ncorrectly of the proper size and forms and motions of clouds.  The same\r\ncloud which to one observer may be glowing with light, to another may be\r\nenveloped in shadow.  That which appears to be its summit may be only a\r\nportion of its outer edge, while that which seems to be its lower bed may\r\nreally be a portion of its further border.  A spectator, on the summit of\r\na tall cliff, may observe what he takes to be a single cloud; while a\r\nsecond spectator, on lower ground, will perceive that there are two\r\nclouds.  The motions of clouds are so deceptive, that they often seem to\r\nbe moving in a curve over the great concave of heaven, while they are in\r\nfact advancing in nearly a right line.  Suppose, for example that a cloud\r\nis moving from the distant horizon towards the place where we stand, in a\r\nuniform horizontal line without changing either in size or form.  Such a\r\ncloud, when first seen, will appear to be in contact with the distant\r\nhorizon, and consequently much nearer to us than it really is.  As it\r\nadvances towards us, it will seem to rise into the sky, and to become\r\ngradually larger till it is almost directly overhead.  Continuing its\r\nprogress, it will then seem again to descend and to lessen in size as\r\ngradually as it had before increased; till at length it disappears in the\r\ndistant horizon at a point exactly opposite to that at which it was first\r\nseen.  Thus the same cloud, without varying its motion in the least from\r\na straight line, and remaining throughout of the same size and form,\r\nwould seem to be continually varying in magnitude; and the line of its\r\nmotion, instead of being straight, would appear to be curved.  This is\r\none of the most simple cases that can be supposed: but the clouds as they\r\nexist in nature do not remain of the same magnitude, but are constantly\r\nchanging in form, in size, in direction, and in velocity; so that it is\r\nquite impossible to form an accurate idea of their shape and size, or to\r\nexplain their motions.  Clouds, at different elevations, may often be\r\nseen to move in different directions under the influence of different\r\ncurrents of wind.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Different appearance of the same clouds to different observers]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of light and shade in clouds is most striking.  The\r\nwatery particles of which they are composed, yielding constantly to\r\nchanges in temperature and moisture, are always changing; so that a most\r\nbeautiful cloud may alter in figure and appearance in an instant of time;\r\nthe light parts may suddenly become dark, and those that were shaded may\r\nall at once glow in the rays of the sun.  Again, the appearance of a\r\ncloud, with respect to the sun, may entirely alter its character.  The\r\nsame cloud, to one observer, may appear entirely in shade, to another\r\ntipped with silver; to a third it may present brilliant points and\r\nvarious degrees of shade, or one of its edges only may appear\r\nilluminated; sometimes the middle parts may appear in shadow, while the\r\nmargin may be partially luminous, rendering the middle parts all the more\r\nobscure by the contrast.\r\n\r\nA wonderful variety may also be produced by the shadow of one cloud\r\nfalling upon another.  The accompanying sketch furnishes an example of\r\nthis.  Sometimes the whole of a cloud projects a shadow through the air\r\nupon some other far distant cloud, and this again upon another, until at\r\nlength it reaches the ground.  The shadows of moving clouds may often be\r\ntraced upon the ground, and they contribute greatly to modify the\r\nappearance of the landscape.  A large number of small flickering clouds\r\nproduce broken lights and shades which have an unpleasant jarring effect;\r\nbut when the clouds are massive, or properly distributed, the shadows\r\noften produce a high degree of repose.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Shadows of clouds]\r\n\r\nClouds are often seen to advantage in mountainous countries.  Here the\r\naspect of the heavens may be entirely different at different elevations.\r\nA single cloud in the valley may conceal the whole of the upper sky from\r\nan observer; but as he ascends he may gradually get above this and other\r\nlayers or bands of cloud, and see a beautifully variegated sky above him,\r\nwhile the clouds which conceal the valley may be rolling at his feet.\r\nEvelyn, in his Memoirs, notices a scene of this kind.  He says,--\"Next\r\nmorning we rode by Monte Pientio, or, as vulgarly called, Monte\r\nMantumiato, which is of an excessive height, ever and anon peeping above\r\nairy clouds with its snowy head, till we had climbed to the inn at\r\nRadicofany, built by Ferdinand the greate Duke for the necessary\r\nrefreshment of travellers in so inhospitable a place.  As we ascended we\r\nentered a very thick, solid, and dark body of cloudes, which looked like\r\nrocks at a little distance, which lasted neare a mile in going up; they\r\nwere dry, misty vapours, hanging undissolved for a vast thicknesse, and\r\nobscuring both sun and earth, so that we seemed to be in the sea rather\r\nthan in the cloudes, till, having pierced through it, we came into a most\r\nserene heaven, as if we had been above all human conversation, the\r\nmountain appearing more like a great island than joyn'd to any other\r\nhills, for we could perceive nothing but a sea of very thick cloudes\r\nrowling under our feete like huge waves, every now and then suffering the\r\ntop of some other mountain to peepe through, which we could discover many\r\nmiles off: and betweene some breaches of the cloudes we could see\r\nlandskips and villages of the subjacent country.  This was one of the\r\nmost pleasant, newe, and altogether surprising objects that I had ever\r\nbeheld.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following interesting account of the ascent of the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe by Captain Basil Hall, it will be seen that heavy rain clouds\r\nmay skirt the mountain, while its summit is in a pure and dry air.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 24th of August,\" he says, \"we left Oratava to ascend the\r\n    Peak.  The day was the worst possible for our purpose, as it rained\r\n    hard; and was so very foggy that we could not see the Peak, or indeed\r\n    any object beyond one hundred yards distant.\r\n\r\n    \"After riding slowly up a rugged path for four hours, it became\r\n    extremely cold, and, as the rain never ceased for an instant, we were\r\n    by this time drenched to the skin, and looked with no very agreeable\r\n    feelings to the prospect of passing the night in wet clothes.  At\r\n    length the night began to close in, and the guides talked of the\r\n    improbability of reaching the English station before night.  It was\r\n    still raining hard; but we dismounted, and took our dinner as\r\n    cheerfully as possible, and hoping for clearer weather the next day.\r\n    On remounting, we soon discovered that the road was no longer so\r\n    steep as it had been heretofore, and the surface was comparatively\r\n    smooth: we discovered, in short, that we had reached a sort of\r\n    table-land, along which we rode with ease.  Presently we thought the\r\n    fog less dense, and the drops of rain not so large, and the air less\r\n    chilling.  In about half an hour we got an occasional glimpse of the\r\n    blue sky; and as we ascended, (for our road, though comparatively\r\n    level, was still upon the rise,) these symptoms became more manifest.\r\n    The moon was at the full, and her light now became distinct, and we\r\n    could see the stars in the zenith.  By this time we had reached the\r\n    Llano de los Remenos, or Retamos Plain, which is many thousand feet\r\n    above the sea; and we could distinctly see that during the day we had\r\n    merely been in a cloud, above which having now ascended, the upper\r\n    surface lay beneath us like a country covered with snow.  It was\r\n    evident, on looking round, that no rain had fallen on the pumice\r\n    gravel over which we were travelling.  The mules were much fatigued,\r\n    and we got off to walk.  In a few minutes our stockings and shoes\r\n    were completely dried, and in less than half an hour all our clothes\r\n    were thoroughly dried.  The air was sharp and clear, like that of a\r\n    cold frosty morning in England; and though the extreme dryness, and\r\n    the consequent rapid evaporation, caused considerable cold, we were\r\n    enabled by quick exercise to keep ourselves comfortable.  I had\r\n    various instruments with me, but no regular hygrometer: accident,\r\n    however, furnished me with one sufficiently indicative of the dry\r\n    state of the air.  My gloves, which I kept on while mounted, were\r\n    completely soaked with the rain; and I took them off during this\r\n    walk, and, without considering what was likely to happen, rolled them\r\n    up, and carried them in my hand.  When, at the end of an hour, or\r\n    somewhat less, we came to remount our mules, I found the gloves as\r\n    thoroughly dried and shrivelled up as if they had been placed in an\r\n    oven.  During all the time we were at the Peak itself, on the 26th,\r\n    the sky was clear, the air quite dry, and we could distinguish,\r\n    several thousand feet below us, the upper and level surface of the\r\n    stratum of clouds through which we had passed the day before, and\r\n    into which we again entered on going down, and found precisely in the\r\n    same state as when we started.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to observe an effect quite contrary to the one given\r\nin the last two examples, the high summits of mountains being frequently\r\nconcealed by heavy clouds of mist, while at a very short distance below\r\nthem the air is clear and pure.  In ascending to the Port of Venasque,\r\none of the mountain passes of the Pyrenees, Mr. Murray found the mists so\r\ndense that he despaired of getting above them, or of their clearing away.\r\nBut fortunately the wind freshened, and the mist, broken by it, \"came\r\nsweeping,\" he says, \"over our heads, sometimes enveloping us in darkness,\r\nsometimes exposing the blue sky, and a part of the mountains.  Section\r\nafter section of the bald and towering masses which rose above the path\r\nwere displayed to us, one after another, as if the whole had been a sight\r\ntoo great for us to look upon.  Sometimes the clouds opened, and the\r\nsnows, sparkling in the sun-beams, were before us; at others, an enormous\r\npeak of the mountain would shoot its dark head through the mist, and,\r\nwithout visible support, seem as if it were about to fall upon us.\r\nAgain, when we imagined ourselves hemmed in on all sides by the\r\nmountains, and within a few feet of their rugged sides, a passing breeze\r\nwould disclose the dark waters of the lakes hundreds of feet beneath us.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the effect of light and darkness, of sunshine and of mist, working\r\nupon materials of such grandeur as those near the Port of Venasque, was a\r\nsight well worthy of admiration, and one which is rarely to be seen. * *\r\n* * Excepting the intervals of light which the gusts of wind, by\r\ndispersing the mists, had bestowed upon us, we had hitherto,\r\ncomparatively speaking, been shrouded in darkness, particularly for the\r\nten minutes preceding our arrival at the Port: my astonishment may\r\ntherefore be imagined when, the instant that I stepped beyond the limits\r\nof the Port, I stood in the purest atmosphere--not a particle of mist,\r\nnot even a cloud, was perceptible.  The phenomenon was curious, and its\r\ninterest greatly heightened from the situation in which it took place.\r\nThe mist rolling up the valley through which we had passed, was, the\r\nmoment that it could be said to reach the Spanish frontier,--the moment\r\nit encircled the edges of the high ridges which separated the countries,\r\nthrown back, as it were, indignantly, by a counter current from the\r\nSpanish side.  The conflicting currents of air, seemingly of equal\r\nstrength, and unable to overcome each other, carried the mist\r\nperpendicularly from the summits of the ridge, and filling up the\r\ncrevices and fissures in its uneven surface, formed a wall many thousand\r\nfeet above it, of dark and (from the appearance of solidity which its\r\nmassive and perpendicular character bestowed upon it) apparently\r\nimpenetrable matter.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the various phenomena of clouds may be seen to great\r\nadvantage in mountain regions; and there is only one other method of\r\nseeing them to greater perfection, and that is from the car of a balloon.\r\nThe following description of an aerial voyage, by Mr. M. Mason, in\r\nOctober 1836, will convey a better idea of the magnificence of a cloudy\r\nsky than any terrestrial prospect could do.  He says,--\r\n\r\n    \"Scarcely had we quitted the earth before the clouds, which had\r\n    previously overhung us, began to envelop us on all sides, and\r\n    gradually to exclude the fading prospect from our sight.  It is\r\n    scarcely possible to convey an adequate idea of the effect produced\r\n    by this apparently trivial occurrence.  Unconscious of our own motion\r\n    from any direct impression upon our own feelings, the whole world\r\n    appeared to be in the act of receding from us in the dim vista of\r\n    infinite space; while the vapoury curtain seemed to congregate on all\r\n    sides and cover the retreating masses from our view.  The trees and\r\n    buildings, the spectators and their crowded equipages, and finally,\r\n    the earth itself, at first distinctly seen, gradually became obscured\r\n    by the thickening mist, and growing whiter in their forms, and\r\n    fainter in their outlines, soon faded away 'like the baseless fabric\r\n    of a vision,' leaving us, to all appearance, stationary in the cloud\r\n    that still continued to involve us in its watery folds.  To heighten\r\n    the interest and maintain the illusion of the scene, the shouts and\r\n    voices of the multitude whom we had left behind us, cheering the\r\n    ascent, continued to assail us, (long after the interposing clouds\r\n    had effectually concealed them from our eyes,) in accents which every\r\n    moment became fainter and fainter till they were finally lost in the\r\n    increasing distance.\r\n\r\n    \"Through this dense body of vapour, which may be said to have\r\n    commenced at an altitude of about 1000 feet, we were borne upwards to\r\n    perhaps an equal distance, when the increasing light warned us of our\r\n    approach to its superior limits, and shortly after, the sun and we\r\n    rising together, a scene of splendour and magnificence suddenly burst\r\n    upon our view, which it would be vain to expect to render\r\n    intelligible by any mode of description within our power.  Pursuing\r\n    the illusion, which the previous events had been so strongly\r\n    calculated to create, the impression upon our senses was that of\r\n    entering upon a new world to which we had hitherto been strangers,\r\n    and in which not a vestige could be perceived to remind us of that we\r\n    had left, except the last faint echo of the voices which still dimly\r\n    reached us, as if out of some interminable abyss into which they were\r\n    fast retreating.\r\n\r\n    \"Above us not a single cloud appeared to disfigure the clear blue\r\n    sky, in which the sun on one side, and the moon in her first quarter\r\n    on the other, reigned in undisturbed tranquillity.  Beneath us, in\r\n    every direction, as far as the eye could trace, and doubtless much\r\n    further, the whole plane of vision was one extended ocean of foam,\r\n    broken into a thousand fantastic forms; here swelling into mountains,\r\n    there sinking into lengthened fosses, or exhibiting the appearance of\r\n    vast whirlpools; with such a perfect mimicry of the real forms of\r\n    nature, that, were it not for a previous acquaintance with the\r\n    general character of the country below us, we should frequently have\r\n    been tempted to assert, without hesitation, the existence of\r\n    mountainous islands penetrating through the clouds, and stretching in\r\n    protracted ranges along the distant verge of our horizon.\r\n\r\n    \"In the centre of this hemisphere, and at an elevation of about 3000\r\n    feet above the surface of the clouds, we continued to float in\r\n    solitary magnificence; attended only at first by our counterpart--a\r\n    vast image of the balloon itself with all its paraphernalia\r\n    distinctly thrown by the sun upon the opposite masses of vapour,\r\n    until we had risen so high that even that, outreaching the material\r\n    basis of its support, at length deserted us; nor did we again\r\n    perceive it until, preparatory to our final descent, we had sunk to a\r\n    proper elevation to admit of its re-appearance.\r\n\r\n    \"Not the least striking feature of our, and similar situations, is\r\n    the total absence of all perceptible motion, as well as of the sound\r\n    which, in ordinary cases, is ever found to accompany it.  Silence and\r\n    tranquillity appear to hold equal and undisputed sway throughout\r\n    these airy regions.  No matter what may be the convulsions to which\r\n    the atmosphere is subjected, nor how violent its effects in sound and\r\n    motion upon the agitated surface of the earth, not the slightest\r\n    sensation of either can be detected by the individual who is floating\r\n    in its currents.  The most violent storm, the most outrageous\r\n    hurricane, pass equally unheeded and unfelt; and it is only by\r\n    observing the retreating forms of the stable world beneath, that any\r\n    certain indication can be obtained as to the amount or violence of\r\n    the motion to which the individual is actually subjected.  This,\r\n    however; was a resource of which we were unable to avail ourselves,\r\n    totally excluded as we were from all view of the earth, or any fixed\r\n    point connected with it.\r\n\r\n    \"Once, and only once, for a few moments preparatory to our final\r\n    descent, did we obtain a transitory glimpse of the world beneath us.\r\n    Upon approaching the upper surface of the vapoury strata, which we\r\n    have described as extending in every direction around, a partial\r\n    opening in the clouds discovered to us for an instant a portion of\r\n    the earth, appearing as if dimly seen through a vast pictorial tube,\r\n    rapidly receding behind us, variegated with furrows, and intersected\r\n    with roads running in all directions; the whole reduced to a scale of\r\n    almost graphic minuteness, and from the fleecy vapour that still\r\n    partially obscured it, impressing the beholder with the idea of a\r\n    vision of enchantment, which some kindly genius had, for an instant,\r\n    consented to disclose.  Scarcely had we time to snatch a hasty\r\n    glance, ere we had passed over the spot, and the clouds uniting\r\n    gradually concealed it from our view.\r\n\r\n    \"After continuing for a short space further, in the vain hope of\r\n    being again favoured with a similar prospect, the approach of night\r\n    made it desirable that we should prepare for our return to earth,\r\n    which we proceeded to accomplish accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n        [Picture: Kerr and his family in the middle of the flood]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF RAIN IN MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICTS--THE DISTRICT OF MORAY--THE\r\nGREAT FLOODS OF 1829--COMMENCEMENT OF THE RAIN--THE SWOLLEN\r\nRIVERS--DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF THE FLOOD--MEANS ADOPTED FOR THE RESCUE OF\r\nCOTTAGERS--KERR AND HIS BRAVE DELIVERERS--RESCUE OF FUNNS AND HIS\r\nFAMILY--FLOODS OF THE RHONE IN 1840--OVERFLOWING OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that some years are wetter than others; but to persons\r\nliving in tolerably flat countries an unusually wet season causes no\r\ngreat inconvenience.  It interferes, it is true, with outdoor\r\nemployments, but people seldom apprehend any danger from the long\r\ncontinuance of rain.  It is not so, however, in hilly or mountainous\r\nregions; an unusual fall of rain swells the rivers to such an extent,\r\nthat they often overflow their banks, and occasion much damage to the\r\nsurrounding districts; or, where the river's banks are defended on both\r\nsides by perpendicular rocks, the waters sometimes rise so fast as to\r\nattain a height of forty or fifty feet above their natural level, and\r\nfrom this height they pour with destructive violence over the face of the\r\ncountry.  Such was the case in the great floods of Moray, which happened\r\nin the year 1829, of which the following is a brief abstract, derived\r\nchiefly from Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's interesting volume on this subject,\r\npublished soon after the calamity for the benefit of the sufferers.\r\n\r\nThe province of Moray, or Murray, is a large district in the north-east\r\nof Scotland, bounded by the Moray Frith on the north-east and north.  The\r\neastern half of the province is lower than the western; in which the\r\nmountains render the whole country characteristically highland.  On the\r\nnorth is a long belt of lowlands, about 240 square miles in extent: this\r\nis greatly diversified with ridgy swells and low hilly ranges, lying\r\nparallel to the frith, and intersected by the rivers Ness, Nairn,\r\nFindhorn, Lossie, and Spey running across it to the sea.  The grounds\r\nbehind the lowlands appear, as seen from the coast, to be only a narrow\r\nridge of bold alpine heights, rising like a rampart to guard the\r\norchards, and woods, and fields: but these really form long and broad\r\nmountain masses, receding, in all the wildness and intricacy of highland\r\narrangement, to a distant summit line.  Some of the broad clifts and long\r\nnarrow vales of these mountains form beautiful and romantic pictures;\r\nwhile many of their declivities are practicable to the plough or other\r\ninstruments of cultivation; so that the bottoms and the reclaimed or\r\nreclaimable sides of the valleys are estimated to comprehend about\r\none-third of the entire area.  The lowlands of Moray have long been\r\ncelebrated for mildness and luxuriousness of climate, and also for a\r\ncertain dryness of atmosphere, which seems to have some intimate\r\nconnexion with the mournful calamity about to be described.  The high\r\nbroad range of mountains on the south-west shelter the lowlands from the\r\nprevailing winds of the country, and exhaust many light vapours and\r\nthinly-charged clouds, which might otherwise produce gentle rains; but,\r\nfor just the same reason, they powerfully attract whatever long broad\r\nstreams of heavy clouds are sailing through the sky, and, among the\r\ngullies and the upland glens, amass their discharged contents with\r\namazing rapidity, and in singular largeness of volume.  The rivers of the\r\ncountry are, in consequence, peculiarly liable to become flooded.  One\r\ngeneral and tremendous outbreak, in 1829, \"afforded an awful exhibition\r\nof the peculiarities of the climate, and will long be remembered, in\r\nconnexion with the boasted luxuriousness of Moray, as an illustration of\r\nhow chastisement and comfort are blended in a state of things which is\r\nbenignly adjusted for the moral discipline of man, and the correction of\r\nmoral evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe heat in the province of Moray during the summer of 1829 was unusually\r\ngreat.  In May the drought was so excessive, as to kill many of the\r\nrecently planted shrubs and trees.  As the season advanced, the\r\nvariations in the barometer became so remarkable, that observers began to\r\nlose all confidence in this instrument.\r\n\r\nThe deluge of rain, which produced the flood of the 3d and 4th of August,\r\nfell chiefly on the Monadhlradh mountains, rising between the south-east\r\npart of Lochness and Kingussie, in Badenoch, and on that part of the\r\nGrampian range forming the somewhat independent groups of the\r\nCairngorums.  The westerly winds, which prevailed for some time\r\npreviously, seem to have produced a gradual accumulation of vapour to the\r\nnorth of our island, and the column, being suddenly impelled by a strong\r\nnorth-easterly blast, was driven towards the south-west, its right flank\r\nalmost sweeping the Caithness and Sutherland coasts, until rushing up and\r\nacross the Moray Frith it was attracted by the lofty mountains just\r\nmentioned, and discharged in fearful torrents.  There fell at a great\r\ndistance from the mountains, within twenty-four hours, about one-sixth of\r\nthe annual allowance of rain; on the mountains themselves the deluge that\r\ndescended, must have been so enormous as to occasion surprise that a\r\nflood, even yet more tremendous in its magnitude and consequences, did\r\nnot result from it.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Findhorn is described as the most important scene of\r\naction.  The banks of this river are well defended by rocks on either\r\nside, and its whole course is distinguished by the most romantic scenery.\r\nAt the part where it is crossed by the old military bridge of Dulsie, the\r\nscenery is of the wildest character.  The flood was most tremendous at\r\nthis bridge, for the water was so confined that it filled the smaller\r\narch altogether, and rose in the great arch to within three feet of the\r\nkey-stone, that is to say, forty feet above the usual level.  This fine\r\nold bridge sustained but little damage, while many of the modern\r\nbuildings were entirely swept away.  At another part of the river, it is\r\nstated, as a curious illustration of the height to which the stream had\r\nrisen, that a gardener waded into the water as it had begun to ebb on the\r\nhaugh, and with his umbrella drove ashore and captured a fine salmon, at\r\nan elevation of fifty feet above the ordinary level of the Findhorn.\r\n\r\nAt Randolph's bridge the opening expands as the rocks rise upwards, till\r\nthe width is about seventy or eighty feet; yet, from the sudden turn of\r\nthe river, as it enters this passage, the stream was so checked in its\r\nprogress that the flood actually rose over the very top of the rocks,\r\nforty-six feet above the usual height, and inundated the level part that\r\nlies over them to the depth of four feet, making a total perpendicular\r\nrise at this point of not less than fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the deluge of the 3d and 4th of August, remain on the\r\nDorbach, in a bank one hundred feet high, which rose with slopes and\r\nterraces covered with birch and alder wood.  The soil being naturally\r\nspongy imbibed so much rain, that it became overloaded, and a mass of\r\nabout an acre in extent, with all its trees on it, gave way at once,\r\nthrew itself headlong down, and bounded across the bed of the Dorbach,\r\nblocking up the waters, flooded and wide as they were at the time.  A\r\nfarmer, who witnessed this phenomenon, told Sir Thomas Dick Lauder that\r\nit fell \"wi' a sort o' a dumb sound,\" while astonished and confounded he\r\nremained gazing at it.  The bottom of the valley is here some two hundred\r\nyards or more wide, and the flood nearly filled it.  The stoppage was not\r\nso great, therefore, as altogether to arrest the progress of the stream;\r\nbut this sudden obstacle created an accumulation of water behind it,\r\nwhich went on increasing for nearly an hour, till, becoming too powerful\r\nto be longer resisted, the enormous dam began to yield, and was swept off\r\nat once, and hurled onwards like a floating island.  While the farmer\r\nstood lost in wonder to behold his farm thus sailing off to the ocean by\r\nacres at a time, another half acre, or more, was suddenly rent from its\r\nnative hill, and descended at once, with a whole grove of trees on it, to\r\nthe river, where it rested on its natural base.  The flood immediately\r\nassailed this, and carried off the greater part of it piecemeal.  At the\r\ntime when Sir Thomas was writing, part of it remained with the trees\r\ngrowing on it in the upright position, after having travelled through a\r\nhorizontal distance of sixty or seventy yards, with a perpendicular\r\ndescent of not less than sixty feet.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: The flood like--Brig of Bannock.  (The dotted line shows the\r\n     height gained by the flood above the usual level of the stream)]\r\n\r\nAt Dunphail, the residence of Mr. Bruce was threatened by the flood, and\r\nthat gentleman prevailed on his wife and daughter to quit the house and\r\nseek refuge on higher ground.  Before quitting the place, their anxiety\r\nhad been extremely excited for the fate of a favourite old pony, then at\r\npasture in a broad green, and partially-wooded island, of some acres in\r\nextent.  As the spot had never been flooded in the memory of man, no one\r\nthought of removing the pony until the wooden bridges having been washed\r\naway rendered it impossible to do so.  When the embankment gave way, and\r\nthe patches of green gradually diminished, Dobbin, now in his 27th year,\r\nand in shape something like a 74-gun ship cut down to a frigate, was seen\r\ngalloping about in great alarm as the wreck of roots and trees floated\r\npast him, and as the last spot of grass disappeared he was given up for\r\nlost.  At this moment he made a desperate effort to cross the stream\r\nunder the house; the force of the current turned him head over heels, but\r\nhe rose again with his head up the river; he made boldly up against it,\r\nbut was again borne down and turned over: every one believed him lost,\r\nwhen rising once more and setting down the waste of water, he crossed\r\nboth torrents, and landed safely on the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nAt night Mr. Bruce says there was something inexpressibly fearful and\r\nsublime in the roar of the torrent, which by this time filled the valley,\r\nthe ceaseless plash of the rain, and the frequent and fitful gusts of the\r\nnorth wind that groaned among the woods.  The river had now undermined\r\nthe bank the house stood on, and this bank had already been carried away\r\nto within four paces of the foundation of the kitchen tower, and, as mass\r\nafter mass fell with a thundering noise, some fine trees, which had stood\r\nfor more than a century on the terrace above it, disappeared in the\r\nstream.  The operations of the flood were only dimly discovered by\r\nthrowing the faint light of lanterns over its waters, and its progress\r\nwas judged of by marking certain intervals of what remained of the\r\nterrace.  One by one these fell in, and at about eleven o'clock the river\r\nwas still rising, and only a space of three yards remained about the\r\nhouse, which was now considered as lost.  The furniture was ordered to be\r\nremoved, and by means of carts and lanterns this was done without any\r\nloss.  About one o'clock in the morning, the partial subsidence of the\r\nflood awakened a slight hope, but in an hour it rose again higher than\r\nbefore.  The banks which supported the house were washed away, and the\r\nhouse itself seemed to be doomed, and the people were therefore sent out\r\nof it.  But Providence ordered otherwise; about four o'clock the clouds\r\nappeared higher, the river began again to subside; by degrees a little\r\nsloping beach became visible towards the foot of the precipice; the flood\r\nceased to undermine, and the house was saved.\r\n\r\nBut the ruin and devastation of the place were frightful to behold.  The\r\nshrubbery, all along the river side, with its little hill and moss-house,\r\nhad vanished; two stone and three wooden buildings were carried off; the\r\nbeautiful fringe of wood on both sides of the river, with the ground it\r\ngrew on, were washed to the ocean, together with all those sweet and\r\npastoral projections of the fields which gave so peaceful and fertile a\r\ncharacter to the valley; whilst the once green island, robbed of its\r\ngroups of trees and furrowed by a dozen channels, was covered with large\r\nstones, gravel, and torn-up roots.\r\n\r\nAt another part of the same river (the Divie) Sir Thomas describes, from\r\nhis own observations, the progress of the flood.  The noise was a\r\ndistinct combination of two kinds of sound: one, an uniform continued\r\nroar; the other, like rapidly repeated discharges of cannon.  The first\r\nof these proceeded from the violence of the water; the other, which was\r\nheard through it, and as it were muffled by it, came from the numerous\r\nstones which the stream was hurling over its uneven bed of rock.  Above\r\nall this was heard the shrieking of the wind.  The leaves were stripped\r\noff the trees and whirled into the air, and their thick boughs and stems\r\nwere bending and cracking beneath the tempest.  The rain was descending\r\nin sheets, not in drops: and a peculiar lurid, bronze-like hue pervaded\r\nthe whole face of nature.  And now the magnificent trees were overthrown\r\nfaster and faster, offering no more resistance than reeds before the\r\nmower's scythe.  Numerous as they were, they were all, individually,\r\nwell-known friends.  Each, as it fell, gave one enormous plash on the\r\nsurface, then a plunge, the root upwards above water for a moment; again\r\nall was submerged--and then up rose the stem disbranched and peeled;\r\nafter which, they either toiled round in the cauldron, or darted, like\r\narrows, down the stream.  \"A chill ran through our hearts as we beheld\r\nhow rapidly the ruin of our favourite and long-cherished spot was going\r\non.  But we remembered that the calamity came from the hand of God; and\r\nseeing that no human power could avail, we prepared ourselves to watch\r\nevery circumstance of the spectacle.\"  In the morning the place was seen\r\ncleared completely of shrubs, trees, and soil; and the space so lately\r\nfilled with a wilderness of verdure was now one vast and powerful\r\nred-coloured river.\r\n\r\nOn the left bank of the Findhorn the discharge of water, wreck, and\r\nstones that burst over the extensive plain of Forres, spreading\r\ndevastation abroad on a rich and beautiful country, was truly terrific.\r\nOn the 3d of August, Dr. Brands, of Forres, having occasion to go to the\r\nwestern side of the river, forded it on horseback, but ere he crossed the\r\nsecond branch of the stream, he saw the flood coming thundering down.\r\nHis horse was caught by it; he was compelled to swim; and he had not long\r\ntouched dry land ere the river had risen six feet.  By the time he had\r\nreached Moy the river had branched out into numerous streams, and soon\r\ncame rolling on in awful grandeur; the effect being greatly heightened by\r\nthe contrary direction of the northerly wind, then blowing a gale.  Many\r\nof the cottages occupied a low level, and the inhabitants were urged to\r\nquit them.  Most of them did so; but some, trusting to their apparent\r\ndistance from the river, refused to move.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock the river had risen and washed away several of the\r\ncottages; and on every side were heard reports of suffering cottagers,\r\nwhose houses were surrounded by water.  One of them was Sandy Smith, an\r\nactive boatman, commonly called _Whins_, (or _Funns_, as it is\r\npronounced,) from his residence on a piece of furzy pasture, at no great\r\ndistance from the river.  From the situation of his dwelling he was given\r\nup for lost; but for a long time the far-distant gleam of light that\r\nissued from his window showed that he yet lived.\r\n\r\nThe barns on the higher grounds accommodated many people; and large\r\nquantities of brose (broth) were made for the dripping and shivering\r\nwretches.  Candles were placed in all the windows of the principal house\r\n(that of Mr. Suter) that poor Funns might see he was not forgotten.  But,\r\nalas! his light no longer burns, and in the midst of the tempest and\r\ndarkness, it was utterly vain to attempt to assist the distressed.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the wide waste of waters was only bounded by the rising\r\ngrounds on the south and west: whilst, towards the north and east, the\r\nwatery world swept off, uninterruptedly, into the expanding Frith and the\r\nGerman Ocean.  The embankments appeared to have everywhere given way; and\r\nthe water that covered the fields, lately so beautiful with yellow wheat,\r\ngreen turnips, and other crops, rushed with so great impetuosity in\r\ncertain directions, as to form numerous currents, setting furiously\r\nthrough the quieter parts of the inundation, and elevated several feet\r\nabove it.  As far as the eye could reach the brownish-yellow moving mass\r\nof water was covered with trees and wreck of every description, whirled\r\nalong with a force that shivered many of them against unseen obstacles.\r\nThere was a sublimity in the mighty power and deafening roar of waters,\r\nheightened by the livid hue of the clouds, the sheeting rain, the howling\r\nof the wind, the lowing of the cattle, and the screaming and wailing of\r\nthe assembled people, that riveted the attention.  In the distance could\r\ndimly be descried the far-off dwelling of poor Funns, its roof rising\r\nlike a speck above the flood, that had evidently made a breach in one of\r\nits ends.\r\n\r\nA family named Kerr, who had refused to quit their dwelling, were the\r\nobjects of great anxiety.  Their son, Alexander Kerr, had been watching\r\nall night, and in the morning was still gazing towards the spot in an\r\nagony of mind, and weeping for the apparently inevitable destruction of\r\nhis parents.  His master tried to comfort him; but even whilst he spoke,\r\nthe whole gable of Kerr's dwelling, which was the uppermost of three\r\nhouses composing the row, gave way, and fell into the raging current.\r\nDr. Brands, who was looking on intently at the time, with a telescope,\r\nobserved a hand thrust through the thatch of the central house.  It\r\nworked busily, as if in despair of life; a head soon appeared; and at\r\nlast Kerr's whole frame emerged on the roof, and he began to exert\r\nhimself in drawing out his wife and niece.  Clinging to one another, they\r\ncrawled along the roof towards the northern chimney.  The sight was\r\ntorturing.  Kerr, a little a-head of the others, was seen tearing off the\r\nthatch, as if trying to force an entrance through the roof, whilst the\r\nmiserable women clung to the house-top, the blankets which they had used\r\nto shelter them almost torn from them by the violence of the hurricane;\r\nand the roof they had left yielding and tottering, fell into the sweeping\r\nflood.  The thatch resisted all Kerr's efforts; and he was now seen to\r\nlet himself drop from the eaves on a small speck of ground higher than\r\nthe rest, close to the foundation of the back wall of the buildings,\r\nwhich was next the spectators.  There he finally succeeded in bringing\r\ndown the women; and there he and they stood, without even room to move.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: Perilous situation of Kerr and his family]\r\n\r\nSome people went on horseback to try to procure boats.  They managed to\r\nget on some way by keeping the line of road.  The water was so deep that\r\nthe horses were frequently swimming; but at length the current became so\r\nstrong that they were compelled to seek the rising grounds.  Dr. Brands\r\nattempted to reach the bridge of Findhorn, in hopes of getting one of the\r\nfishermen's cobbles.  As he was approaching the bridge he learned that\r\nthe last of the three arches had fallen the instant before; and when he\r\ngot to the brink, the waters were sweeping on as if it had never been,\r\nmaking the rocks and houses vibrate with a distinct and tremulous motion.\r\nThe current was playing principally against the southern approach of the\r\nbridge, and soon the usually dry arch, at its further end, burst with a\r\nloud report; its fragments, mixed with water, being blown into the air as\r\nif by gunpowder.  The boats had all been swept away, and the fishermen's\r\nhouses were already one mass of ruin.  The centre of the main stream was\r\nhurried on at an elevation many feet higher than the rest of the\r\nsurrounding sea of waters; the mighty rush of which displayed its power\r\nin the ruin it occasioned.  Magnificent trees, with all their branches,\r\nwere dashing and rending against the rock, and the roaring and crashing\r\nsound that prevailed was absolutely deafening.\r\n\r\nAs there was no chance of getting a boat the Doctor returned with\r\ndifficulty to the house, his mare swimming a great part of the way.  On\r\nagain looking through the telescope at poor Kerr and his family, they\r\nwere seen huddled together on a spot of ground a few feet square, some\r\nforty or fifty yards below their inundated dwelling. {55}  He was\r\nsometimes standing and sometimes sitting on a small cask, and, as the\r\nbeholders fancied, watching with intense anxiety the progress of the\r\nflood, and trembling for every large tree that it brought sweeping past\r\nthem.  His wife, covered with a blanket, sat shivering on a bit of a log,\r\none child in her lap, and a girl of about seventeen, and a boy of about\r\ntwelve years of age, leaning against her side.  A bottle and a glass on\r\nthe ground near the man gave the spectators, as it had doubtless given\r\nhim, some degree of comfort.  Above a score of sheep were standing\r\naround, or wading, or swimming in the shallows.  Three cows and a small\r\nhorse picking at a broken rick of straw that seemed to be half afloat,\r\nwere also grouped with the family.  Dreading that they must all be swept\r\noff, if not soon relieved, the gentlemen hastened to the offices, and\r\nlooked anxiously out from the top of the tower for a boat.  At last they\r\nhad the satisfaction to see one launched from the garden at Earnhill,\r\nabout a mile below.  The boat had been conveyed by a pair of horses, and\r\nhad only just arrived.  It was nobly manned by three volunteers, and they\r\nproceeded at once to the rescue of a family who were in a most perilous\r\nsituation in the island opposite to Earnhill.  The gentlemen on the tower\r\nwatched the motions of this boat with the liveliest interest.  They saw\r\nit tugging up till it was hid from them by the wood.  Again it was seen\r\nbeyond, and soon it dashed into the main stream and disappeared again\r\nbehind the wood, with a velocity so fearful that they concluded it was\r\nlost.  But in a moment it again showed itself, and the brave fellows were\r\nseen plying their oars across the submerged island of Earnhill, making\r\nfor John Smith's cottage; the thatch and a small part of the side walls\r\nof which were visible above the water.  The poor inmates were dragged out\r\nof the windows from under the water, having been obliged to duck within\r\nere they could effect their escape.  The boat then swept down the stream\r\ntowards a place called 'The Lakes,' where John Smith, his wife, and her\r\nmother were safely landed.\r\n\r\nThe boat was next conveyed by the horses to a point from which it was\r\nlaunched for the rescue of the Kerrs.  Having pulled up as far as they\r\ncould in the still water, they approached the desperate current, and\r\nfearlessly dashed into its tumultuous waves.  For a moment the spectators\r\nwere in the most anxious doubt as to the result; for, though none could\r\npull a stronger oar, yet the boat in crossing a distance equal to its own\r\nlength was swept down 200 yards.  Ten yards more would have dashed them\r\nto atoms on the lower stone wall.  But they were now in comparatively\r\nquiet water; and availing themselves of this, they pulled up again to the\r\npark, in the space between two currents, and passed, with a little less\r\ndifficulty, though in the same manner, the second and third streams, and\r\nat length reached the houses.  The spectators gave them three hearty\r\ncheers.  By this time the Kerrs had been left scarcely three feet of\r\nground to stand on, under the back wall of the houses.  A pleasing sight\r\nit was to see the boat touch that tiny strand, and the despairing family\r\ntaken on board.  How anxiously did the spectators watch every motion of\r\nthe little boat, that was now so crowded as very much to impede the\r\nrowers.  They crossed the first two streams, and finally drew up for the\r\nlast and dreadful trial.  There the frail bark was again whirled down;\r\nand notwithstanding all their exertions, the stern just touched the wall.\r\nThe prow however was in stiller water; one desperate pull,--she sprang\r\nforward in safety, and a few more strokes of the oar landed the poor\r\npeople amongst fifty or sixty of their assembled friends.  After mutual\r\ngreetings and embraces, and many tears of gratitude, old Kerr related his\r\nsimple story.  \"Seeing their retreat cut off by the flood, they attempted\r\nto wade ashore.  But the nearer the shore, the deeper and more powerful\r\nwas the current.  The moment was awful.  The torrent increased on all\r\nsides, and night, dark night, was spread over them.  The stream began to\r\nbe too deep for the niece, a girl of twelve years of age,--she lost heart\r\nand began to sink.  At this alarming crisis Kerr seized the trembling\r\ngirl, and placed her on his back, and shoulder to shoulder with his wife,\r\nhe providentially, but with the greatest difficulty, regained his own\r\nhouse.  Between eight and nine o'clock he groped his way, and led his\r\nwife and niece up into the garret.  He could not tell how long they\r\nremained there, but supposed it might be till about two o'clock next\r\nmorning, when the roof began to fail.  To avoid being crushed to death,\r\nhe worked anxiously till he drove down the partition separating them from\r\nthe adjoining house.  Fortunately for him it was composed of wood and\r\nclay, and a partial failure he found in it very much facilitated his\r\noperations.  Having made their way good, they remained there till about\r\neight o'clock in the morning, when the strength of the water without\r\nbecame so great that it bent inwards the bolt of the lock of the\r\nhouse-door, till it had no greater hold of the staple than the\r\neighth-part of an inch.  Aware, that if the door should give way the back\r\nwall of the house would be swept down by the rush of the water inwards,\r\nand that they would be crushed to atoms, he rummaged the garret and\r\nfortunately found a bit of board and a few nails; and standing on the\r\nstairs, he placed one end of it against the door and the other on the\r\nhatch, forming the entrance to the garret, and so nailed it firmly down.\r\nAt last the roof of the second house began to crack over their heads, and\r\nKerr forced a way for himself and his companions through the thatch as\r\nhas been already told.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Funns and his family were not yet rescued from their little island;\r\nand the boat was declared to be too small and weak for so desperate a\r\nvoyage.  It was therefore determined to row to a spot where a larger boat\r\nwas moored.  To effect this, they were compelled to act precisely as they\r\nhad done in proceeding to rescue the Kerrs.  But unfortunately, on\r\nentering the third stream, they permitted the boat to glide down with it,\r\nin the hope that it would carry them in safety through the gate of the\r\nfield, and across the road into that beyond it.  In this, however, they\r\nwere mistaken, and the boat was swamped.  Fortunately for them, they were\r\ncarried into smooth water, and by wading shoulder deep they reached the\r\nlarge boat.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the small boat, they attempted to drag the large one\r\nthrough the gateway against the stream; but it soon filled with water and\r\nswamped, and, in spite of all their exertions, they found it impossible\r\nto get it up.  The small boat was now all they had to trust to, and this\r\nwas next caught by the strong stream and overwhelmed in a moment; and had\r\nnot the men, most providentially, caught and clung to a haycock that\r\nhappened to be floating past, they must have been lost.  They were\r\ncarried along till it stuck on some young alder trees, when each of them\r\ngrasped a bough, and the haycock sailed away, leaving them among the weak\r\nand brittle branches.  They had been here about two hours, when one of\r\nthe men being unable to hold on longer by the boughs, let himself gently\r\ndown into the water with the hope of finding bottom; when, to his\r\nsurprise, he found that the small boat had actually drifted to the root\r\nof the very tree to which they had been carried.  Some salmon nets and\r\nropes had also, by the strangest accident, been lodged there.  The man\r\ncontrived to pull up one of these with his foot, and making a noose, and\r\nslipping it on his great toe, he descended once more, and managed to fix\r\nthe rope round the stern of the boat, which was then safely hauled up,\r\nthe oars, being fixed to the side, being also saved.  The boat was\r\nreturned to Mr. Suter's and fresh manned, when it proceeded to a house\r\noccupied by a family of the name of Cumin, consisting of an old couple,\r\ntheir daughter, and grandson.  By the time they reached the cottage, its\r\nwestern side was entirely gone, and the boat was pushed in at the gap.\r\nNot a sound was heard within, and they suspected that all were drowned;\r\nbut, on looking through a hole in a partition, they discovered the\r\nunhappy inmates roosted, like fowls, on the beams of the roof.  They\r\nwere, one by one, transferred safely to the boat, half dead with cold;\r\nand melancholy to relate, the old man's mind, being too much enfeebled to\r\nwithstand the agonizing apprehensions he had suffered, was now utterly\r\nderanged.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Rescuing cottagers]\r\n\r\nThe poor Funns' were still the last to be relieved.  They and their\r\ncattle were clustered on their little speck of land; and the poor\r\nquadrupeds, being chilled by standing so long in the water, were\r\ncontinually pressing inwards on them.  It was between six and seven\r\no'clock, the weather was clearer, and the waters were subsiding.  The\r\ntask being the most difficult of all, none but the most skilful rowers\r\nwere allowed to undertake it.  One wide inundation stretched from Monro's\r\nhouse to the tiny spot where Funns and his family were; and five\r\ntremendously tumultuous streams raged through it with elevated waves.\r\nThe moment they dashed into the first of them they were whirled down for\r\na great way; but having once got through it, they pulled up in the\r\nquieter water beyond, to prepare for the next; and in doing so, Sergeant\r\nGrant stood in the prow, and with a long rope, the end of which was fixed\r\nto the boat, and wherever he thought he had footing, he sprang out and\r\ndragged them up.  The rest followed his example, and in this way they\r\nwere enabled to start afresh with a sufficient advantage, and they\r\ncrossed all the outer streams in the same manner.  The last they\r\nencountered, being towards the middle of the flood, was fearful, and\r\ncarried them very far down.  But Funns himself, overjoyed to behold them,\r\nwaded towards them, and gave them his best help to drag up the boat\r\nagain.  Glad was he to see his wife and children safely set in the boat.\r\nThe perils of their return were not few; but they were at length happily\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\nThese examples will suffice to show the nature and extent of the great\r\nfloods of Moray.  The inundation covered a space of something more than\r\ntwenty miles in the Plain of Forres, and, as it was expressively remarked\r\nby one of the sufferers, \"Before these floods was the Garden of Eden and\r\nbehind them a desolate wilderness.\"  And how often did the beautiful\r\nexpression of the Psalmist occur to them: \"The floods have lifted up, O\r\nLord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their\r\nwaves.  The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; yea,\r\nthan the mighty waves of the sea.\"  Ps. xciii. 3, 4.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in Scotland alone that the terrors of the floods are\r\nexperienced.  All rivers which rise in high and cold regions, and pass\r\ninto warm lowlands, are naturally very liable to overflow their bounds.\r\nA remarkable example is afforded by the river Rhone, which rises in the\r\nglaciers of Switzerland; and, after passing through the lake of Geneva,\r\ndescends into the south-eastern departments of France,--a very level\r\ndistrict, where the climate is mild and genial.  Rapid meltings of the\r\nice in Switzerland, or heavy falls of rain or snow in that country,\r\ngreatly affect this river; and never, perhaps, were the effects more\r\ndreadful than in the inundations of 1840.  At Lyons, where the Rhone\r\njoins the Saone, the most lamentable scenes took place.  Not only were\r\nthe whole of the low-lying lands in the vicinity of the city completely\r\ndesolated, hundreds of houses overturned, and many cattle swept away, but\r\nthe waters reached the city itself, bursting into the gas conduits, and\r\nthus leaving the people in darkness, and rising to a great height in the\r\nstreets.  The destruction of property, both in-doors and out-of-doors,\r\nwas immense, and the loss of life appalling.  Charitable people and\r\npublic servants went about in boats laden with provisions, which were\r\nsent, at the expense of the magistrates and clergy, to the starving\r\nfamilies pent up in their several abodes, where many of them remained in\r\ntotal darkness by night, and under hourly expectation that the\r\nfoundations of their houses would give way beneath the rushing waters.\r\nIn fact, numbers of houses, and even whole streets, were in this way\r\nsapped and overturned.  Some of the people had fled to the heights near\r\nthe city, at the first rising of the waters, but there they were reduced\r\nto the greatest extremities for want of food, and signal shots were heard\r\nfrom them continually.  This miserable state of things lasted from the\r\nbeginning of November until the 20th or 21st of the same month.  At the\r\nsame time the Rhone appeared like a succession of immense lakes from\r\nLyons to Avignon, and from Avignon to the sea.  A letter from Nismes, a\r\nlittle to the west of Avignon, thus described the scene:--\r\n\r\n    \"As far as the view extends we perceive but one sheet of water, in\r\n    the midst of which appear the tops of trees and houses, with the\r\n    miserable inhabitants perched upon them.  At Valabregue, an island on\r\n    the Rhone, they have hung out a black banner from the church-yard,\r\n    nearly two thousand persons being assembled in that spot, which is on\r\n    an elevation.  Steam-boats are attempting to carry bread to\r\n    Valabregue, and other similarly situated places, but can scarcely\r\n    effect it from the inequality of the ground.  For ten days the rains\r\n    have never ceased.  The space covered by the waters near Avignon is\r\n    calculated at about thirty-six leagues in length and sixty leagues in\r\n    breadth.  Human bodies are seen passing continually on the waters.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the 10th to the 20th of November the Rhone fell several inches each\r\nday, but always rose again somewhat during the night.  It began\r\npermanently to decline on the 20th, and in a few days the streets were\r\nexposed to view, with about a foot of mud on them.  The loss of life and\r\nproperty, through this calamity, are almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nA still grander display of the power and extent of inundations is\r\nafforded by the American rivers.  The mighty waters of the Mississippi,\r\n(a river, whose course extends for several thousand miles,) when swelled,\r\nand overflowing their banks, present a wonderful spectacle.  Unlike the\r\nmountain-torrents, and small rivers, of other parts of the world, the\r\nMississippi rises slowly, continuing for several weeks to increase at the\r\nrate of about an inch in a day.  When at its height, it undergoes little\r\nchange for some days, and after this subsides as slowly as it rose.  A\r\nflood generally lasts from four to six weeks, though it sometimes extends\r\nto two months.  The American naturalist, Audubon, has given a striking\r\naccount of the rush of waters overspreading the land when once this\r\nmighty river has begun to overflow its banks:--\r\n\r\n    \"No sooner has the water reached the upper part of the banks, than it\r\n    rushes out, and overspreads the whole of the neighbouring swamps,\r\n    presenting an ocean overgrown with stupendous forest trees.  So\r\n    sudden is the calamity that every individual, whether man or beast,\r\n    has to exert his utmost ingenuity to enable him to escape from the\r\n    dreaded element.  The Indian quickly removes to the hills of the\r\n    interior, the cattle and game swim to the different strips of land\r\n    that remain uncovered in the midst of the flood, or attempt to force\r\n    their way through the waters until they perish from fatigue.  Along\r\n    the banks of the river the inhabitants have rafts ready-made, on\r\n    which they remove themselves, their cattle, and their provisions, and\r\n    which they then fasten with ropes or grape-vines to the larger trees,\r\n    while they contemplate the melancholy spectacle presented by the\r\n    current, as it carries off their houses and wood-yards piece by\r\n    piece.  Some, who have nothing to lose, and are usually known by the\r\n    name of Squatters, take this opportunity of traversing the woods in\r\n    canoes, for the purpose of procuring game, and particularly the skins\r\n    of animals, such as the deer and bear, which may be converted into\r\n    money.  They resort to the low ridges surrounded by the waters, and\r\n    destroy thousands of deer, merely for their skins, leaving the flesh\r\n    to putrify.\r\n\r\n    \"The river itself, rolling its swollen waters along, presents a\r\n    spectacle of the most imposing nature.  Although no large vessel,\r\n    unless propelled by steam, can now make its way against the current,\r\n    it is seen covered by boats laden with produce, which, running out\r\n    from all the smaller streams, float silently towards the city of New\r\n    Orleans, their owners, meanwhile, not very well assured of finding a\r\n    landing-place even there.  The water is covered with yellow foam and\r\n    pumice, the latter having floated from the rocky mountains of the\r\n    north-west.  The eddies are larger and more powerful than ever.  Here\r\n    and there tracts of forest are observed undermined, the trees\r\n    gradually giving way, and falling into the stream.  Cattle, horses,\r\n    bears, and deer are seen at times attempting to swim across the\r\n    impetuous mass of foaming and boiling water; whilst, here and there,\r\n    a vulture or an eagle is observed perched on a bloated carcass,\r\n    tearing it up in pieces, as regardless of the flood, as on former\r\n    occasions it would have been of the numerous sawyers and planters\r\n    with which the surface of the river is covered when the water is low.\r\n    Even the steamer is frequently distressed.  The numberless trees and\r\n    logs that float along, break its paddles, and retard its progress.\r\n    Besides it is on such occasions difficult to procure fuel to maintain\r\n    its fires.\"\r\n\r\nIn certain parts, the shores of the Mississippi are protected by\r\nartificial barriers called Levees.  In such places, during a flood, the\r\nwhole population of the district is engaged in strengthening these\r\nbarriers, each proprietor being in great alarm lest a crevasse should\r\nopen and let in the waters upon his fields.  In spite of all exertions\r\nthis disaster generally happens: the torrent rushes impetuously over the\r\nplantations, and lays waste the most luxuriant crops.\r\n\r\nThe mighty changes effected by the inundations of the Mississippi are\r\nlittle known until the waters begin to subside.  Large streams are then\r\nfound to exist where none had formerly been.  These are called by\r\nnavigators _short cuts_, and some of them are so considerable as to\r\ninterfere with the navigation of the Mississippi.  Large sand-banks are\r\nalso completely removed by the impetuous whirl of the waters, and are\r\ndeposited in other places.  Some appear quite new to the navigator, who\r\nhas to mark their situation and bearings in his log-book.  Trees on the\r\nmargin of the river have either disappeared, or are tottering and bending\r\nover the stream preparatory to their fall.  The earth is everywhere\r\ncovered by a deep deposit of muddy loam, which, in drying, splits into\r\ndeep and narrow chasms, forming a sort of network, from which, in warm\r\nweather, noxious exhalations rise, filling the atmosphere with a dense\r\nfog.  The Squatter, shouldering his rifle, makes his way through the\r\nmorass in search of his lost stock, to drive the survivors home and save\r\nthe skins of the drowned.  New fences have everywhere to be formed, and\r\nnew houses erected; to save which from a like disaster, the settler\r\nplaces them on a raised platform, supported by pillars made of the trunks\r\nof trees.  \"The lands must be ploughed anew; and if the season is not too\r\nfar advanced, a crop of corn and potatoes may yet be raised.  But the\r\nrich prospects of the planter are blasted.  The traveller is impeded in\r\nhis journey, the creeks and smaller streams having broken up their banks\r\nin a degree proportionate to their size.  A bank of sand, which seems\r\nfirm and secure, suddenly gives way beneath the traveller's horse, and\r\nthe next moment the animal has sunk in the quicksand, either to the chest\r\nin front, or to the crupper behind, leaving its master in a situation not\r\nto be envied.\"\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Mists in the Valley]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS FORMS OP CLOUDS--THE CIRRUS, OR CURL-CLOUD--THE CUMULUS, OR\r\nSTACKEN-CLOUD--THE STRATUS, OR FALL-CLOUD--THE CIRRO-CUMULUS, OR\r\nSONDER-CLOUD--THE CIRRO-STRATUS, OR WANE-CLOUD--THE CUMULO-STRATUS, OR\r\nTWAIN-CLOUD--THE NIMBUS, OR RAIN-CLOUD--ARRANGEMENT OF\r\nRAIN-CLOUDS--APPEARANCES OF A DISTANT SHOWER--SCUD--CAUSE OF\r\nRAIN--FORMATION OF CLOUDS--MISTS--HEIGHTS OF CLOUDS--APPEARANCE OF THE\r\nSKY ABOVE THE CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nMany persons are apt to suppose that the clouds are among the most fitful\r\nand irregular appearances in the world; fleeting and unstable in their\r\nnature, uncertain in their forms, apparently subject to no fixed laws,\r\nand obedient neither to times nor seasons.  Attentive observers, however,\r\nhave proved that the beauty and harmony which are everywhere found to\r\nprevail in nature when rightly understood, can also be traced, even in\r\nthe clouds.  Although very much still remains to be discovered respecting\r\nthem, yet it is found that, like all the other natural productions, they\r\nadmit of being arranged and classified.  So obvious was this to persons\r\nwhose interest it is to observe the weather, that, long before scientific\r\nmen had studied the subject, country people had noticed the different\r\nforms of clouds, and had learned to distinguish them by different names.\r\n\r\nThe first scientific man who made the clouds the object of his particular\r\nstudy, was Luke Howard, who, from an attentive consideration of their\r\nforms and appearances, found that they might all be arranged under three\r\nsimple or primary forms, namely:--\r\n\r\n1.  The _Cirrus_--so called from its resemblance to a _curled lock of\r\nhair_.  (Figures, 1, 2; page 77.)\r\n\r\n2.  The _Cumulus_, from the _heaped_ appearance presented by the convex\r\nmasses which form this cloud.  (Figure 7.)\r\n\r\n3.  The _Stratus_, from its spreading out horizontally in a continuous\r\nlayer, and increasing from below.  (Figure 10.)\r\n\r\nThese three primary forms are subject to four modifications:--\r\n\r\nThe first is the _Cirro-cumulus_, consisting of small roundish and\r\nwell-defined masses, in close horizontal arrangement.  (Figure 3.)\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Various forms of clouds]\r\n\r\nThe second is the _Cirro-Stratus_, and the masses which compose it are\r\nsmall and rounded, but thinned off towards a part, or towards the whole\r\nof their circumference.  They are sometimes separate, and sometimes in\r\ngroups.  (Figures 4, 5, 6.)\r\n\r\nThe third is the _Cumulo-Stratus_, which is made up of the cirro-stratus\r\nblended with the cumulus.  (Figure 8.)\r\n\r\nThe fourth is the _Cumulo-Cirro-Stratus_, or _Nimbus_.  This is the true\r\n_rain-cloud_, or system of clouds from which rain is falling.  (Figure\r\n9.)\r\n\r\nThe term _modification_ applies to the structure or manner in which a\r\ngiven mass of cloud is made up, and not to its precise form or size,\r\nwhich in most clouds varies every instant.  Mr. Howard remarks, that it\r\nmay be at first difficult to distinguish one modification from another,\r\nor to trace the narrow limits which sometimes separate the different\r\nmodifications; but a moderate acquaintance with the subject will soon\r\nenable any one to point out the various forms, and to a great extent to\r\njudge of the state of the weather by them.  In order, therefore, to\r\nassist the reader in gaining a certain amount of knowledge on this\r\ninteresting subject, it may be useful to state more fully the various\r\nphenomena of the different forms of clouds already enumerated.\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: The Cirrus, or curl-cloud]\r\n\r\nThe Cirrus occurs in very great variety, and in some states of the air is\r\nconstantly changing.  It is the first cloud that appears in serene\r\nweather, and is always at a great height.  The first traces of the cirrus\r\nare some fine whitish threads, delicately-pencilled on a clear blue sky;\r\nand as they increase in length others frequently appear at the sides,\r\nuntil numerous branches are formed, extending in all directions.\r\nSometimes these lines cross each other and form a sort of delicate\r\nnet-work.  In dry weather the cirrus is sharp, defined, and fibrous in\r\ntexture, the lines vanishing off in fine points.  When the air is damp\r\nthis cloud may be seen in the intervals of rain, but is not well defined,\r\nand the lines are much less fibrous.  Such cirri as these often grow into\r\nother varieties of cloud, and are frequently followed by rain.\r\n\r\nThe cirrus may last a few minutes only, or continue for hours.  Its\r\nduration is shortest when near other clouds.  Although it appears to be\r\nstationary, it has some connexion with the motions of the atmosphere; for\r\nwhenever, in fair weather, light variable breezes prevail, cirri are\r\ngenerally present.  When they appear in wet weather, they quickly pass\r\ninto the cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dalton, these clouds are from three to five miles above the\r\nearth's surface.  When viewed from the summits of the highest mountains\r\nthey appear as distant as from the plains.  Another proof of their great\r\nheight is, their continuing to be tinged by the sun's rays in the evening\r\ntwilight with the most vivid colours, while the denser clouds are in the\r\ndeepest shade.\r\n\r\nThe cirrus appears to be stationary; but, on comparison with a fixed\r\nobject, it will sometimes be found to make considerable progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUMULUS, OR STACKEN-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And now the mists from earth are clouds in heaven:\r\n    Clouds, slowly castellating in a calm\r\n    Sublimer than a storm; while brighter breathes\r\n    O'er the whole firmament the breadth of blue,\r\n    Because of that excessive purity\r\n    Of all those hanging snow-white palaces,\r\n    A gentle contrast, but with power divine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cumulus is a day cloud; it usually has a dense, compact appearance,\r\nand moves with the wind.  In the latter part of a clear morning a small\r\nirregular spot appears suddenly at a moderate elevation.  This is the\r\nnucleus or commencement of the cloud, the upper part of which soon\r\nbecomes rounded and well defined, while the lower forms an irregular\r\nstraight line.  The cloud evidently increases in size on the convex\r\nsurface, one heap succeeding another, until a pile of cloud is raised or\r\n_stacked_ into one large and elevated mass, or _stacken-cloud_, of\r\nstupendous magnitude and beauty, disclosing mountain summits tipped with\r\nthe brightest silver; the whole floating along with its point to the sky,\r\nwhile the lower surface continues parallel with the horizon.\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: The Cumulus, or stacken-cloud]\r\n\r\nWhen several cumuli are present, they are separated by distances\r\nproportioned to their size: the smaller cumuli crowding the sky, while\r\nthe larger ones are further apart.  But the bases always range in the\r\nsame line; and the increase of each cloud keeps pace with that of its\r\nneighbour, the intervening spaces remaining clear.\r\n\r\nThe cumulus often attains its greatest size early in the afternoon, when\r\nthe heat of the day is most felt.  As the sun declines, this cloud\r\ngradually decreases, retaining, however, its characteristic form till\r\ntowards sunset, when it is, more or less, hastily broken up and\r\ndisappears, leaving the sky clear as in the early part of the morning.\r\nIts tints are often vivid, and pass one into the other in a most pleasing\r\nmanner, during this last hour of its existence.\r\n\r\nThis cloud accompanies and foretells fine weather.  In changeable weather\r\nit sometimes evaporates almost as soon as it is formed; or it appears\r\nsuddenly, and then soon passes off to some other modification.\r\n\r\nIn fair weather this cloud has a moderate elevation and extent, and a\r\nwell-defined rounded surface.  Before rain it increases more rapidly than\r\nat other times, and appears lower in the atmosphere, with its surface\r\nfull of loose fleeces.\r\n\r\nThe formation of large cumuli to leeward, in a strong wind, indicates the\r\napproach of a calm with rain.  When they do not disappear or subside\r\nabout sun-set, but continue to rise, thunder is to be expected in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the beauty and magnificence which this description of\r\ncloud adds to the face of nature, it serves to screen the earth from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun; by its multiplied reflections to diffuse and, as\r\nit were, economise the light; and also to convey immense stores of vapour\r\nfrom the place of its origin to a region in which moisture may be wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRATUS, OR FALL-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Cumulus belongs to the day, so does the Stratus to the night.  It\r\nis the lowest of all the clouds, and actually rests upon the earth, or\r\nthe surface of water.  It is of variable extent and thickness, and is\r\ncalled _Stratus_, _a bed_ or _covering_.  It is generally formed by the\r\n_sinking_ of vapour in the atmosphere, and on this account has been\r\ncalled _Fall-cloud_.  It comprehends all those level, creeping mists,\r\nwhich, in calm evenings, spread like an inundation from the valleys,\r\nlakes, and rivers, to the higher ground. {85}  But on the return of the\r\nsun the beautiful level surface of this cloud begins to put on the\r\nappearance of cumulus, the whole, at the same time, rising from the\r\nground like a magnificent curtain.  As the cloud ascends, it is broken up\r\nand evaporates or passes off with the morning breeze.  The stratus has\r\nlong been regarded as the harbinger of fine weather; and, indeed, there\r\nare few days in the year more serene than those whose morning breaks out\r\nthrough a stratus.\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: The Stratus, or fall-cloud]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRRO-CUMULUS, OR SONDER-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cirrus having continued for some time increasing or stationary,\r\nusually passes either to the cirro-cumulus or to the cirro-stratus, at\r\nthe same time descending to a lower station in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Cirro-cumulus is formed from a cirrus, or a number of small separate\r\ncirri, passing into roundish masses, in which the extent of the cirrus is\r\nno longer to be seen.  This change takes place either throughout the\r\nwhole mass at once, or progressively from one extremity to the other.  In\r\neither case the same effect is produced on a number of neighbouring cirri\r\nat the same time, and in the same order.  It appears, in some instances,\r\nto be hastened by the approach of other clouds.\r\n\r\n              [Picture: The Cirro-Cumulus, or sonder-cloud]\r\n\r\nThe cirro-cumulus forms a very beautiful sky, exhibiting sometimes\r\nnumerous distinct beds of small connected clouds floating at different\r\nheights.  It is frequent in summer, and accompanies warm, dry weather.\r\nOn a fine summer's evening the small masses which compose this cloud, are\r\noften well defined, and lying quite _asunder_, or separate from one\r\nanother; and on this account the term _sonder-cloud_ has been applied to\r\nthis modification.  The whole sky is sometimes covered with these small\r\nmasses.  They are occasionally, and more sparingly, seen in the intervals\r\nof showers, and in winter.\r\n\r\nBloomfield, in the following beautiful lines, has noticed the appearance\r\nof the sonder-cloud:--\r\n\r\n    \"For yet above these wafted clouds are seen\r\n    (In a remoter sky still more serene)\r\n    Others, detach'd in ranges through the air,\r\n    Spotless as snow, and countless as they're fair;\r\n    Scatter'd immensely wide from east to west,\r\n    The beauteous semblance of a flock at rest:\r\n    These, to the raptur'd mind, aloud proclaim\r\n    The mighty Shepherd's everlasting name.\"\r\n\r\nThis cloud may either evaporate or disappear, or it may pass to the\r\ncirrus, or sink lower and become a cirro-stratus.  In stormy weather,\r\nbefore thunder, a cirro-cumulus often appears, composed of very dense and\r\ncompact round bodies, in very close arrangement.  When accompanied by the\r\ncumulo-stratus, it is a sure indication of a coming storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRRO-STRATUS, OR WANE-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cloud appears to be formed from the fibres of the cirrus sinking\r\ninto a horizontal position, at the same time that they approach each\r\nother sideways.  This cloud is to be distinguished by its flatness and\r\ngreat horizontal extension, in proportion to its height; a character\r\nwhich it always retains, under all its various forms.  As this cloud is\r\ngenerally changing its figure, and slowly sinking, it has been called the\r\n_wane-cloud_.  A collection of these clouds, when seen in the distance,\r\nfrequently give the idea of shoals of fish.  Sometimes the whole sky is\r\nso mottled with them, as to obtain for it the name of the _mackerel-back\r\nsky_, from its great resemblance to the back of that fish.  Sometimes\r\nthey assume an arrangement like discs piled obliquely on each other.  But\r\nin this, as in other instances, the structure must be attended to rather\r\nthan the form, for this varies much, presenting, at times, the appearance\r\nof parallel bars or interwoven streaks, like the grain of polished wood.\r\nIt is thick in the middle and thinned off towards the edge.\r\n\r\n               [Picture: The Cirro-Stratus, or wane-cloud]\r\n\r\nThese clouds precede wind and rain.  The near or distant approach of a\r\nstorm may often be judged of from their greater or less abundance and\r\nduration.  They are almost always to be seen in the intervals of storms.\r\nSometimes the cirro-stratus, and the cirro-cumulus, appear together in\r\nthe sky, and even alternate with each other in the same cloud, presenting\r\nmany curious changes; and a judgment may be formed of the weather likely\r\nto ensue, by observing which prevails at last.\r\n\r\nThe cirro-stratus most frequently forms the solar and lunar halo.  Hence\r\nthe reason of the prognostics of bad weather commonly drawn from the\r\nappearance of halos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUMULO-STRATUS, OR TWAIN-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n              [Picture: The Cumulo-Stratus, or twain-cloud]\r\n\r\nThis is a blending of two kinds of cloud (hence the name of\r\n_twain-cloud_,) and it often presents a grand and beautiful appearance,\r\nbeing a collection of large fleecy clouds overhanging a flat stratum or\r\nbase.  When a cumulus increases rapidly a cumulo-stratus frequently forms\r\naround its summit, resting thereon as on a mountain, while the former\r\ncloud continues to be seen, in some degree, through it.  This state of\r\nthings does not continue long.  The cumulo-stratus speedily becomes\r\ndenser and spreads, while the upper part of the cumulus extends likewise,\r\nand passes into it, the base continuing as it was.  A large, lofty, dense\r\ncloud is thus formed which may be compared to a mushroom with a very\r\nthick, short stem.  The cumulo-stratus, when well formed and seen singly,\r\nand in profile, is quite as beautiful an object as the cumulus.  Mr.\r\nHoward has occasionally seen specimens constructed almost as finely as a\r\nCorinthian capital; the summit throwing a well-defined shadow upon the\r\nparts beneath.  It is sometimes built up to a great height.  The finest\r\nexamples occur between the first appearance of the fleecy cumuli and the\r\ncommencement of rain, while the lower atmosphere is comparatively dry,\r\nand during the approach of thunder storms.  The appearance of the\r\ncumulo-stratus, among ranges of hills, presents some interesting\r\nphenomena.  It appears like a curtain dropping among them and enveloping\r\ntheir summits; the hills reminding the spectator of the massy Egyptian\r\ncolumns which support the flat-roofed temples of Thebes.  But when a\r\nwhole sky is crowded with these clouds, and the cumulus rises behind\r\nthem, and is seen through the interstices, the whole, as it passes off in\r\nthe distant horizon, presents to the fancy mountains covered with snow,\r\nintersected with darker ridges, lakes of water, rocks and towers.\r\nShakspeare seems to have referred to this modification in the well-known\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;\r\n    A vapour, sometimes, like a bear or lion,\r\n    A towered citadel, a pendent rock,\r\n    A forked mountain, a blue promontory,\r\n    With trees upon 't that nod unto the world,\r\n    And mock our eyes with air.--\r\n    That which is now a horse, even with a thought\r\n    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct\r\n    As water is in water.\r\n\r\nThe _distinct_ cumulo-stratus is formed in the interval between the first\r\nappearance of the fleecy _cumulus_ and the commencement of rain, while\r\nthe lower atmosphere is yet dry; also during the approach of thunder\r\nstorms when it has frequently a reddish appearance.  Its _indistinct_\r\nappearance is chiefly in the longer or shorter intervals of showers of\r\nrain, snow, or hail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUMULO-CIRRO-STRATUS; NIMBUS OR RAIN-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nClouds, in any one of the preceding forms, at the same degree of\r\nelevation, or two or more of these forms at different elevations, may\r\nincrease and become so dense as completely to obscure the sky; this, to\r\nan inexperienced observer, would seem to indicate the speedy commencement\r\nof rain.  But Mr. Howard is of opinion that clouds, while in any of the\r\nstates above described, never let fall rain.\r\n\r\nBefore rain the clouds always undergo a change of appearance,\r\nsufficiently remarkable to give them a distinct character.  This\r\nappearance, when the rain happens overhead, is but imperfectly seen; but\r\nfrom the observations of aeronauts, it appears that whenever a fall of\r\nrain occurs, and the sky is at the same time entirely overcast with\r\nclouds, there will be found to exist another stratum of clouds at a\r\ncertain elevation above the former.  So, also, when the sky is entirely\r\novercast and rain is altogether or generally absent, the aeronaut, upon\r\ntraversing the canopy immediately above him, is sure to enter upon an\r\nupper hemisphere either perfectly cloudless or nearly so.  These remarks\r\nwere, we believe, first made by Mr. M. Mason, and he states that they\r\nhave been verified during many hundred ascents.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1837, two ascents were made by Mr. Mason, which well\r\nillustrate what has been said.  On the 12th, \"the sky was completely\r\noverspread with clouds, and torrents of rain fell incessantly during the\r\nwhole of the day.  Upon quitting the earth, the balloon was almost\r\nimmediately enveloped in the clouds, through which it continued to work\r\nits way upwards for a few seconds.  Upon emerging at the other side of\r\nthis dense canopy, a vacant space, of some thousand feet in breadth,\r\nintervened, above which lay another stratum of a similar form and\r\nobserving a similar character.  As the rain, however, still continued to\r\npour from this second layer of clouds, to preserve the correctness of the\r\nobservation, a third layer should, by right, have existed at a still\r\nfurther elevation; which, accordingly, proved to be the case.  On the\r\nsubsequent occasion of the ascent of the same balloon, (October 17th,) an\r\nexactly similar condition of the atmosphere, with respect to clouds,\r\nprevailed; unaccompanied, however, with the slightest appearance of rain.\r\nNo sooner had the balloon passed the layer of clouds immediately above\r\nthe surface of the earth, than, as was anticipated, not a single cloud\r\nwas to be found in the firmament beyond; an unbroken expanse of clear\r\nblue sky everywhere embracing the frothy plain that completely\r\nintercepted all view of the world beneath.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howard had not the advantages of a balloon to assist his\r\nobservations.  He has noticed that during rain and before the arrival of\r\nthe denser and lower clouds, or through their interstices, there exists,\r\nat a greater height, a thin light veil or a hazy appearance.  When this\r\nhas considerably increased, the lower clouds are seen to spread till they\r\nunite in all points and form one uniform sheet.  The rain then commences,\r\nand the lower clouds arriving from the windward, move under this sheet\r\nand are successively lost in it.  When the latter cease to arrive, or\r\nwhen the sheet breaks, letting through the sun-beams, every one's\r\nexperience teaches him to expect that the rain will abate or leave off.\r\n\r\nBut there often follows an immediate and great addition to the quantity\r\nof cloud.  At the same time the darkness becomes less, because the\r\narrangement, which now returns, gives free passage to the rays of light;\r\nthe lower broken clouds rise into cumuli, and the upper sheets put on the\r\nvarious forms of the cumulo-stratus, sometimes passing to the\r\ncirro-cumulus.\r\n\r\nThe various phenomena of the rain-cloud are best seen in a distant\r\nshower.  If the cumulus be the only cloud at first visible, its upper\r\npart is seen to become tufted with cirri.  Several adjacent clouds also\r\napproach and unite at its side.  The cirri increase, extending upwards\r\nand sideways, after which the shower is seen to commence.  At other\r\ntimes, the cirro-stratus is first formed above the cumulus, and their\r\nsudden union is attended with the production of cirri and rain.  In\r\neither case the cirri spring up in proportion to the quantity of rain\r\nfalling, and give the cloud a character by which it is easily known at\r\ngreat distances, and which has long been called by the name of _nimbus_.\r\n\r\nWhen one of these arrives hastily with the wind, it brings but little\r\nrain, and frequently some hail or driven snow.\r\n\r\nSince rain may be produced and continue to fall from the slightest\r\nobscuration of the sky by the nimbus, while a cumulus or a\r\ncumulo-stratus, of a very dark and threatening aspect, passes on without\r\ndischarging any until some change of state takes place; it would seem as\r\nif nature had destined the latter as reservoirs, in which water is\r\ncollected from extensive regions of the air for occasionally irrigating\r\nparticular spots in dry seasons; and by means of which it is arrested, at\r\ntimes, in its descent in wet ones.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nimbus is one of the least beautiful of clouds, it is,\r\nnevertheless, now and then adorned by the splendid colouring of the\r\nrainbow, which can only be seen in perfection when the dark surface of\r\nthis cloud forms for it a background.\r\n\r\nThe small ragged clouds which are sometimes seen sailing rapidly through\r\nthe air, are called _scud_.  They consist of portions of a rain-cloud,\r\nprobably broken up by the wind, and are dark or light according as the\r\nsun shines upon them.  They are the usual harbingers of rain, and, as\r\nsuch, are called by various names, such as _messengers_, _carriers_, and\r\n_water-waggons_.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn attempting to explain the production of clouds and rain, it is\r\nnecessary to observe that the subject is beset with difficulties--the\r\ndiscussion of which does not belong to this little volume; but the\r\nfollowing notice of Dr. Hutton's theory may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that the air supplies itself with moisture\r\nfrom the surface of the waters of the earth.  This it continues to do at\r\nall temperatures, until it is so charged with vapour that it cannot\r\ncontain any more.  The air is then said to be _saturated_.  Now, the\r\nquantity of moisture which a given bulk of air can contain, depends\r\nentirely upon the temperature of the air for the time being.  The higher\r\nthe temperature of the air the greater will be the quantity of vapour\r\ncontained in it; and, although it may be perfectly invisible to the eye,\r\non account of the elasticity which the heat imparts to it, yet it can\r\neasily be made visible by subtracting a portion of the heat.  If, for\r\nexample, a glass of cold water be suddenly brought into a warm room,\r\nmoisture from the air will be condensed upon the outside of the glass in\r\nthe form of dew.  A similar change is supposed to take place when two\r\ncurrents of air having different temperatures, but both saturated with\r\nvapour, are mingled together; an excess of vapour is set free, which\r\nforms a cloud or falls down as rain.  If the currents continue to mingle\r\nuniformly, \"the clouds soon spread in all directions, so as to occupy the\r\nwhole horizon; while the additional moisture, incessantly brought by the\r\nwarmer current, keeps up a constant supply for condensation, and produces\r\na great and continued deposition of moisture in the form of rain.  By\r\ndegrees, the currents completely intermingle, and acquire a uniform\r\ntemperature; condensation then ceases; the clouds are re-dissolved; and\r\nthe whole face of nature, after being cooled and refreshed by the\r\nnecessary rain, is again enlivened by the sunshine, thus rendered still\r\nmore agreeable by its contrast with the previous gloom.\"\r\n\r\nIf the cloud, produced by the mingling of two differently heated currents\r\nof moist air, happen to form in the upper regions of the sky, it may be\r\nheavier than its own bulk of air, and will consequently begin to sink.\r\nShould the atmosphere near the earth be less dense than the cloud, the\r\nlatter will continue to descend till it touches the ground, where it\r\nforms a mist.  If the vapour has been condensed rapidly and abundantly,\r\nthe watery particles will form rain, hail, or snow, according to the\r\ntemperature of the air through which they pass.  But it may happen that\r\nthe cloud, in descending, arrives in a warmer region than that in which\r\nit was formed: in this case, the condensed moisture may again become\r\nvapour, and ascend again to a region where condensation may again take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniell's explanation of the formation of rain differs from the above\r\nin some of its particulars, which are not sufficiently elementary to be\r\ngiven here; but it may be instructive to give a few of Mr. Howard's\r\nillustrations respecting the formation of the various clouds.  If hot\r\nwater be exposed to cool air, it _steams_--that is, the vapour given off\r\nfrom the surface is condensed in mixing with the air; and the water thus\r\nproduced appears in visible particles, the heat of the vapour passing\r\ninto the air.  This effect may be seen about sunrise, in summer, on the\r\nsurface of ponds warmed by the sun of the previous day, and also with\r\nwater newly pumped from a well.  But the small cloud formed in these\r\ninstances usually disappears almost as soon as formed, the air being too\r\ndry to allow it to remain.  But in the wide regions of the atmosphere the\r\ncase is different, on account of the vast supply of vapour, and the\r\nascent and descent of the cloud to regions which allow it to remain\r\ntolerably permanent.  In the fine evenings of autumn, and occasionally at\r\nother seasons, mists appear suddenly in the valleys, gradually filling\r\nthese low places, and even rising to a certain height, forming a foggy\r\natmosphere for the following day.  These collections of visible vapour\r\nresting on the earth, and often cut off so as to form a level surface\r\nabove, so nearly resemble a sheet of water, as to have been occasionally\r\nmistaken for an inundation, the occurrence of the previous night.  Such\r\nis the origin and appearance of the _stratus_: it constitutes the fog of\r\nthe morning, and sometimes, as at the approach of a long frost, occupies\r\nthe lower atmosphere for several days.  But the sun, we will suppose, has\r\nbroken through and dissipated this obscurity, and cleared the lower air.\r\nOn looking up to the blue sky, we see some few spots showing the first\r\nformation of a cloud there: these little collections increase in number,\r\nand become clouds, heaped, as it were, on a level base, and presenting\r\ntheir rounded forms upwards; in which state they are carried along in the\r\nbreeze, remaining distinct from each other in the sky.  This is the\r\n_cumulus_, or _heap_.\r\n\r\nBy and by, if the clouds continue to form, and enough vapour is supplied\r\nfrom above, these heaps are seen to grow over their base like a mushroom\r\nor cauliflower.  Perhaps a flat top is seen forming separately, and this\r\nafterwards joins the simple heap of cloud; or the flat forms and the\r\nheaps become mixed irregularly among each other, occupying the spaces\r\neverywhere, till the sky becomes overcast, and presents the usual\r\nappearance of dense clouds.  This is the _cumulo-stratus_, or _heaped and\r\nflat cloud_.  It is not productive of rain, and it forms, both in summer\r\nand in winter, the common scenery of a full sky.\r\n\r\nOn examining minutely the higher regions of the air, especially after the\r\nsky has been clear for some time, the spectator will probably see the\r\ncirrus descending from above in the form of _threads_ or _locks_ and\r\n_feathers_, which go on increasing until they fill the sky.  They are\r\nmore commonly seen above the two former kinds, which float upon the clear\r\nair below.  On continuing to watch the cirri, they will be seen to pass\r\nto the intermediate form of cirro-cumulus, consisting of smaller rounded\r\nclouds attached to each other, or simply collected together in a flat\r\naggregate, and forming the mottled or dappled sky.\r\n\r\nThe cumulo-stratus is more dense and continuous in its structure; thick\r\nin the middle, and thinned off towards the edges.  Over-head it is a mere\r\nbed of haze, more or less dense.  In the horizon, when seen sideways, it\r\noften resembles shoals of fish, as already noticed; but it is liable to\r\nput on the most ragged and patchy appearances, making a very ugly sky.\r\n\r\nThe nimbus, or rain cloud, is seen to the greatest advantage in profile,\r\nin the horizon, and at a great distance, when it often resembles a lofty\r\ntower raised by its greater height to a conspicuous place among the dark\r\nthreatening clouds, and catching the sun's last rays upon its broad\r\nsummit and sides.  In its nearer approach, it may always be known by\r\nbeing connected below with an obscurity caused by the rain it lets fall,\r\nand which reaches down to the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn ascending from the lower valleys to the tops of lofty mountains,\r\nclouds may be traced through six modifications, the cirrus being seen\r\nfrom the loftiest summits, while the other forms are only skirting the\r\nsides of the mountains.  Mr. Mason remarks, that clouds occasionally lie\r\nso low, that before the balloon seems to have entirely quitted the earth,\r\nit has been received between their limits, and entirely enveloped within\r\ntheir watery folds.  Clouds, on the contrary, are sometimes at such a\r\nheight, that the balloon either never comes into contact with them at\r\nall, or, if it passes through one layer, the aeronaut continues to behold\r\nanother occupying a still remoter region of the skies above.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it is stated that the natural region of clouds is a\r\nstratum of the atmosphere lying between the level of the first thousand\r\nfeet, and that of one removed about ten thousand feet above it.  Of\r\ncourse it is not supposed but that clouds are occasionally found on both\r\nsides of the bounds here assigned to them; the mist occupies the lowest\r\nvalleys, while, on the other hand, long after the aeronaut has attained\r\nthe height of ten thousand feet, some faint indications of clouds may\r\nstill be seen partially obscuring the dark blue vault above him.  As he\r\ncontinues to ascend, the blue of the sky increases in intensity; and\r\nshould a layer of clouds shut out all view of the earth, \"above and all\r\naround him extends a firmament dyed in purple of the intensest hue; and\r\nfrom the apparent regularity of the horizontal plane on which it rests,\r\nbearing the resemblance of a large inverted bowl of dark blue porcelain\r\nstanding upon a rich Mosaic floor or tesselated pavement.  Ascending\r\nstill higher, the colour of the sky, especially about the zenith, is to\r\nbe compared with the deepest shade of Prussian blue.\"\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: Various forms of hail-stones]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nON HAIL--THE HAIL-STORMS OF FRANCE--DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF HAIL--THE\r\nHAIL-STORMS OF SOUTH AMERICA--THEIR SURPRISING EFFECTS--ORIGIN AND NATURE\r\nOF HAIL--PERIODICAL FALLS OF HAIL--HAIL CLOUDS--HAILSTONES--THEIR VARIOUS\r\nFORMS--EXTRAORDINARY SIZE OF HAILSTONES.\r\n\r\nAs hail seems to be nothing more than frozen rain, it is necessary to\r\ncollect a few particulars respecting it in this place.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is essentially a rain country; but there are some parts of\r\nthe world which have obtained the unhappy distinction of being _hail_\r\ncountries: such, for example, as some of the most beautiful provinces of\r\nFrance, which are frequently devastated by hail-storms.  One of the most\r\ntremendous hail-storms on record is that which occurred in that country\r\nin July 1788.  This fearful storm was ushered in by a dreadful and almost\r\ntotal darkness which suddenly overspread the whole country.  In a single\r\nhour the whole face of nature was so entirely changed, that no person who\r\nhad slept during the tempest could have believed himself in the same part\r\nof the world when he awoke.  Instead of the smiling bloom of summer, and\r\nthe rich prospects of a forward autumn, which were just before spread\r\nover the face of that fertile and beautiful country, it now presented the\r\ndreary aspect of an arctic winter.  The soil was changed into a morass;\r\nthe standing corn beaten into a quagmire; the vines were broken to\r\npieces, and their branches bruised in the same manner; the fruit-trees of\r\nevery kind were demolished, and the hail lay unmelted in heaps like rocks\r\nof solid ice.  Even the robust forest trees were incapable of\r\nwithstanding the fury of the tempest; and a large wood of chesnut trees,\r\nin particular, was so much damaged, that it presented, after the storm,\r\nlittle more than bare and naked trunks.  The vines were so miserably\r\nhacked and battered, that four years were estimated as the shortest\r\nperiod in which they could become again in any degree productive.  Of the\r\nsixty-six parishes included in the district of Pontoise, forty-three were\r\nentirely desolated; while, of the remaining twenty-three, some lost\r\ntwo-thirds, and others above half their harvest.\r\n\r\nThis storm began in the south, and proceeded in two parallel bands from\r\nthe south-west to the north-east; the extent of one of them being 175\r\nleagues, and of the other 200; thus traversing nearly the whole length of\r\nthat great kingdom, and even a portion of the Low countries.  The mean\r\nbreadth of the eastern portion was four leagues, and of the western two:\r\nand, what is very remarkable, the interval between the two bands,\r\namounting to five leagues, was deluged with heavy rain.  The largest of\r\nthe hail-stones weighed half a pound each.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this storm, which was from south to north, was at the\r\nrate of 16.5 leagues an hour; and the velocity of the two bands was\r\nprecisely the same.  The continuance of the hail was limited to seven or\r\neight minutes, at each of the principal stations marked.\r\n\r\nThere are instances, however, on record, in which hail has produced even\r\nmore tremendous results than those above recorded.  In some parts of\r\nSouth America hail-stones are sometimes so large and so hard, and fall\r\nwith such violence, that large animals are killed by them.  Mr. Darwin,\r\nencamping at the foot of the Sierra Tapalguen, says:--\"One of the men had\r\nalready found thirteen deer lying dead, and I saw their fresh hides.\r\nAnother of the party, a few minutes after my arrival, brought in seven\r\nmore.  Now I well know that one man without dogs could hardly have killed\r\nseven deer in a week.  The men believed they had seen about fifteen dead\r\nostriches, (part of one of which we had for dinner;) and they said that\r\nseveral were running about evidently blind in one eye.  Numbers of small\r\nbirds, as ducks, hawks, and partridges, were killed.  I saw one of the\r\nlatter with a black mark on its back, as if it had been struck with a\r\npaving-stone.  A fence of thistle-stalks round the hovel was nearly\r\nbroken down; and my informer, putting his head out to see what was the\r\nmatter, received a severe cut, and now wears a bandage.  The storm was\r\nsaid to have been of limited extent: we certainly saw, from our last\r\nnight's bivouac, a dense cloud and lightning in this direction.  It is\r\nmarvellous how such strong animals as deer could thus have been killed;\r\nbut, I have no doubt, from the evidence I have given, that the story is\r\nnot in the least exaggerated.\"  Dr. Malcolmson informed Mr. Darwin, that\r\nhe witnessed, in 1831, in India, a hail-storm, which killed numbers of\r\nlarge birds, and much injured the cattle.  These hail-stones were flat;\r\none was ten inches in circumference; and another weighed two ounces.\r\nThey ploughed up a gravel-walk like musket-balls, and passed through\r\nglass windows, making round holes, but not cracking them.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the origin and formation of hail that cannot well be\r\nexplained.  Volta regarded the formation of small flakes of ice, the\r\nkernels of future hail-stones, in the month of July, during the hottest\r\nhours of the day, as one of the most difficult phenomena in nature to\r\nexplain.  It is difficult to account for the comparative scarcity of\r\nhail-showers in winter; as also, for the great size which hailstones are\r\noften known to attain.\r\n\r\nIt appears from certain resemblances in the descents of rain, snow, and\r\nhail, that they have a common origin, their different formations being\r\nexplained by difference of temperature.  Howard has observed a huge\r\nnimbus affording hard snowballs and distinct flakes of snow at the same\r\ntime.  Hail and rain are by no means uncommon from the same cloud.  The\r\nsize of a cloud may be such, or clouds may exist in different elevations,\r\nwhich in an upper region produce hail, in a lower region snow, and at a\r\nstill lower elevation rain.  Rain may also form in an upper region of the\r\nsky, and descend into a colder stratum of the atmosphere, and be frozen\r\ninto hail.  Hail generally precedes storms of rain.\r\n\r\nChange of wind and the action of opposite currents, so necessary for the\r\nproduction of rain, are also frequent during hail-storms.  While clouds\r\nare agitated with the most rapid motions, rain generally falls in\r\ngreatest abundance; and if the agitation be very great it generally\r\nhails.  Before the descent of hail a noise is heard, a particular kind of\r\ncrackling, which has been compared to the emptying of a bag of walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe descent of hail in some countries appears to occur at particular\r\nperiods.  In the central parts of France, Italy, and Spain, it usually\r\nhails most abundantly during the warmest hours of the day in spring and\r\nsummer, and in Europe generally it falls principally during the day; but\r\nthere are examples recorded of great hail-storms which have taken place\r\nduring the night.  Near the equator, it seldom hails in places situated\r\nat a lower level than 350 fathoms, for, although the hail may be formed,\r\nthe warmth of the regions prevents it from falling in that state.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of hail clouds seems to be distinguished from other stormy\r\nclouds by a very remarkable shadowing.  Their edges present a multitude\r\nof indentations, and their surfaces disclose here and there immense\r\nirregular projections.  Arago has seen hail-clouds cover with a thick\r\nveil the whole extent of a valley, at a time when the neighbouring hills\r\nenjoyed a fine sky and an agreeable temperature.\r\n\r\nHailstones of similar forms are produced at similar levels.  They are\r\nsmaller on the tops of mountains than in the neighbouring plains.  If the\r\ntemperature or the wind alter, the figures of the hailstones become\r\nimmediately changed.  Hailstones of the form of a six-sided pyramid have\r\nbeen known to change, on the wind changing to the north-east, to convex\r\nlenses, so transparent and nicely formed, that they magnified objects\r\nwithout distorting them.  Some hailstones are globular, others elongated,\r\nand others armed with different points.\r\n\r\nIn the centres of hailstones small flakes of spungy snow are frequently\r\nfound, and this usually is the only opaque point in them.  Sometimes the\r\nsurface is covered with dust, like fine flour, and is something between\r\nhail and snow.  This never falls during summer in southerly countries.\r\nIn the Andes hailstones from five to seven lines in diameter are\r\nsometimes formed of layers of different degrees of transparency, so as to\r\npermit rings of ice to be separated from them with a very slight blow.\r\nIn Orkney, hailstones have fallen as finely polished as marbles, of a\r\ngreyish white colour, not unlike fragments of light-coloured marble.\r\nHailstones are often so hard and elastic, that those which fall on the\r\nstones rebound without breaking to the height of several yards; and they\r\nhave been known to be projected from a cloud almost horizontally, and\r\nwith such velocity as to pierce glass windows with a clear round hole.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th May, 1822, some remarkable hailstones fell at Bonn, on the\r\nRhine.  Their general size was about an inch and a half in diameter, and\r\ntheir weight 300 grains.  When picked up whole, which was not always the\r\ncase, their general outline was elliptical, with a white, or nearly\r\nopaque spot in the centre, about which were arranged concentric layers,\r\nincreasing in transparency to the outside.  Some of them exhibited a\r\nbeautiful star-like and fibrous arrangement, the result of rows of air\r\nbubbles dispersed in different radii.  The figures at the head of this\r\nchapter show the external and internal appearances of these hailstones.\r\n\r\nThe smaller figures represent pyramidal hail, common in France, and\r\noccasionally in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBrown hailstones have been noticed.  Humboldt saw hail fall of the colour\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th July, 1808, Howard noticed, in Gloucestershire, hailstones\r\nfrom three to nine inches in circumference; appearing like fragments of a\r\nvast plate of ice which had been broken in its descent to the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th June, 1814, Dr. Crookshank noticed, in North America,\r\nhailstones of from thirteen to fifteen inches in circumference.  They\r\nseemed to consist of numerous smaller stones fused together.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th July, 1818, during a storm in Orkney, Mr. Neill picked up\r\nhailstones weighing from four ounces to nearly half a pound.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: Rain gauges]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MEASURING THE QUANTITY OF RAIN THAT FALLS--THE RAIN\r\nGAUGE--METHODS OF OBSERVING FOR RAIN AND SNOW--EFFECTS OF ELEVATION ON\r\nTHE QUANTITY OF RAIN--DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOP OF A TALL BUILDING AND\r\nTHE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN--SIZE OF DROPS OF RAIN--VELOCITY OF THEIR\r\nFALL--QUANTITY OF RAIN IN DIFFERENT LATITUDES--EXTRAORDINARY FALLS OF\r\nRAIN--REMARKS ON THE RAIN OF THIS COUNTRY--INFLUENCE OF THE MOON--ABSENCE\r\nOF RAIN--REMARKABLE DROUGHT IN SOUTH AMERICA--ITS TERRIBLE EFFECTS AND\r\nCONSEQUENCES--ARTIFICIAL RAINS.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain which falls at different parts of the earth's\r\nsurface is very variable; and for the purpose of measuring it instruments\r\ncalled _Rain-gauges_ have been contrived.  The simplest form is a funnel\r\nthree or four inches high, and having an area of one hundred square\r\ninches.  This may be placed in the mouth of a large bottle, and, after\r\neach fall of rain, the quantity may be measured by a glass jar divided\r\ninto inches and parts.  This simple gauge being placed on the ground in\r\nan open spot, will evidently represent a portion of the ground, and will\r\nshow the depth of rain which would cover it at and about that spot,\r\nsupposing the ground to be horizontal, and that the water could neither\r\nflow off nor sink into the soil.  Thus, by taking notice of the quantity\r\nof rain which falls day by day, and year by year, and taking the average\r\nof many years, we get the mean annual quantity of rain for the particular\r\nspot in question.  By an extension of these observations, it is evident\r\nthat the mean annual fall of rain may be known for a district or a\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nA more convenient form of rain-gauge than the one just noticed, is made\r\nby placing the funnel at the top of a brass or copper cylinder, connected\r\nwith which at the lower point, is a glass tube with a scale, measuring\r\ninches and tenths of an inch.  The water stands at the same height in the\r\nglass tube as it does in the cylinder, and being visible in the tube the\r\nheight can be immediately read on the scale.  The cylinder and the tube\r\nare so constructed, that the sum of the areas of their sections is a\r\ngiven part, such as a tenth of the area of the mouth of the funnel; so\r\nthat each inch of water in the tube is equal to the tenth of an inch of\r\nwater which enters the mouth of the funnel.  A stop-cock is added for\r\ndrawing off the water from the cylinder after each observation is noted\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSome rain-gauges are constructed for showing the quantity of rain which\r\nfalls from each of the four principal quarters.  Others are made so as to\r\nregister, themselves, the quantity of rain fallen.  One of this kind, by\r\nMr. Crosley, consists of a funnel through which the rain passes to a\r\nvibrating trough; when, after a sufficient quantity has fallen into its\r\nhigher side, it sinks down and discharges the rain which escapes by a\r\ntube.  The vibrating action of this trough moves a train of wheel-work\r\nand indices, which register upon a dial plate the quantity of rain\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nWhatever form of rain-gauge is adopted, it must be placed in an exposed\r\nsituation, at a distance from all buildings, and trees, and other objects\r\nlikely to interfere with the free descent of rain into the funnel.  It is\r\nusual, in rainy weather, to observe the quantity of water in the gauge\r\nevery morning; but this does not seem to be often enough, considering how\r\nfreely water evaporates in an exposed situation.  An error may also arise\r\nfrom some of the water adhering to the sides of the vessel, unless an\r\nallowance is made for the quantity thus lost by a contrivance such as the\r\nfollowing:--Let a sponge be made damp, yet so that no water can be\r\nsqueezed from it, and with this collect all the water which adheres to\r\nthe funnel and cylinder, after as much as possible has been drawn off;\r\nthen, if the sponge be squeezed, and the water from it be received in a\r\nvessel which admits of measuring its quantity, an estimate may be made of\r\nthe depth due to it; and this being added to the depth given by the\r\ninstrument, would probably show correctly the required depth of rain.\r\n\r\nWhen snow has fallen the rain-gauge may not give a correct quantity, as a\r\nportion of it may be blown out, or a greater quantity may have fallen\r\nthan the mouth will contain.  In such cases, it is recommended to take a\r\ncylindrical tube and press it perpendicularly into the snow, and it will\r\nbring out with it a cylinder equal to the depth.  This, when melted, will\r\ngive the quantity of water which can be measured as before.  The\r\nproportion of snow to water is about seventeen to one; and hail to water,\r\nabout eight to one.  These quantities, however, may vary according to the\r\ncircumstances under which the snow or hail has fallen, and the time they\r\nhave been upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe rain-gauge should be placed as near the surface of the ground as\r\npossible; for it is a perplexing circumstance, that the rain-gauge\r\nindicates very different quantities of rain as falling upon the very same\r\nspot, according to the different heights at which it is placed.  Thus it\r\nhas been found, that the annual depth of rain at the top of Westminster\r\nAbbey was 12.1 inches nearly, while, on the top of a house sixteen feet\r\nlower, it was rather more than 18.1 inches, and on the ground, in the\r\ngarden of the house, it was 22.6 inches.  M. Arago has also found from\r\nobservations made during twelve years, that on the terrace of the\r\nObservatory at Paris the annual depth was about 2.25 inches less than in\r\nthe court thirty yards below.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be expected from these observations, that less rain\r\nfalls on high ground than at the level of the sea.  Such however is not\r\nthe case, except on abrupt elevations; where the elevation is made by the\r\nnatural and gradual slope of the earth's surface, the quantity of rain is\r\ngreater on the mountain than in the plain.  Thus, on the coast of\r\nLancashire, there is an annual fall of 39 inches; while at Easthwaite,\r\namong the mountains in the same county, the annual depth of rain amounts\r\nto 86 inches.  By comparing the registers at Geneva and the convent of\r\nthe Great St. Bernard, it appears that at the former place, by a mean of\r\nthirty-two years, the annual fall of rain is about 30.75 inches; while at\r\nthe latter, by a mean of twelve years, it is a little over 60 inches.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain these remarkable differences, it must not be supposed\r\nthat the clouds extend down to the ground, so as to cause more rain at\r\nthe foot of Westminster Abbey than on its roof.  There is no doubt that\r\nin moist weather the air contains more water near the ground than a few\r\nhundred feet above it; and probably, the same cause which determined a\r\nfall from the cloud, would also throw down the moisture floating at a low\r\nelevation.  Much rain also proceeds from drifting showers, of short\r\nduration, and the current moves more slowly along the surface, and allows\r\nthe drops to fall as fast as they are formed.  In hilly countries, on the\r\ncontrary, clouds and vapours rest on the summits without descending into\r\nthe plains, and, according to some, the hills attract electricity from\r\nthe clouds, and thus occasion rain to fall.  Mr. Phillips supposes that\r\neach drop of rain continues to increase in size from the commencement to\r\nthe end of its descent, and as it passes successively through the moist\r\nstrata of the air, obtains its increase from them; while the rain which\r\nfalls on the mountain may leave these moist strata untouched, so that\r\nthey may, in fact, not form rain at all.\r\n\r\nThe drops of rain are of unequal size, as may be seen from the marks made\r\nby the first drops of a shower upon any smooth surface.  They vary in\r\nsize from perhaps the twenty-fifth to a quarter of an inch in diameter.\r\nIt is supposed that in parting from the clouds they fall with increasing\r\nspeed, until the increasing resistance of the air becomes equal to their\r\nweight, when they continue to fall with an uniform velocity.  A\r\nthunder-shower pours down much faster than a drizzling rain.  A flake of\r\nsnow, being perhaps nine times more expanded than water, descends thrice\r\nas slow.  But hailstones are often several inches in length, and fall\r\nwith a velocity of seventy feet in a second, or at the rate of about\r\nfifty miles an hour, and hence the destructive power of these missiles in\r\nstripping and tearing off fruit and foliage.\r\n\r\nThe annual quantity of rain decreases from the equator to the poles, as\r\nappears from the following table, which gives the name of the station,\r\nits latitude, and the average annual number of inches of rain:--\r\n\r\nCoast of Malabar            lat. 11 degrees 30'     135.5 inches.\r\n                            N.\r\nAt Grenada, Antilles        12 degrees              126\r\nAt Cape Francois, St.       19 degrees 46'          120\r\nDomingo\r\nAt Calcutta                 22 degrees 23'          81\r\nAt Rome                     41 degrees 54'          39\r\nIn England                  50 to 55 degrees        31\r\nAt St. Petersburgh          59 degrees 16'          16\r\nAt Uleaborg                 65 degrees 30'          13.5\r\n\r\nThe number of rainy days, on the contrary, increases from the equator to\r\nthe poles.\r\n\r\nFrom 12 to 43 degrees N. lat.--the number of rainy days in    78\r\nthe year amounts to\r\nFrom 43 to 46 degrees                                         103\r\nFrom 46 to 50 degrees                                         134\r\nFrom 50 to 60 degrees                                         161\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth of rain which falls in the Indian ocean is during the\r\ntime when the periodical winds, called the _monsoons_, change their\r\ndirection.  When the winds blow directly in-shore the rains are very\r\nabundant, so much so that, after a continuance of twenty-four hours, the\r\nsurface of the sea has been covered with a stratum of fresh water, good\r\nenough for drinking, and ships have actually filled their casks from it.\r\nColonel Sykes observes, that the deluge-like character of a monsoon in\r\nthe Ghats of Western India, is attested by the annual amount of 302.25\r\ninches, at Malcolmpait, on the Mahabuleshwar Hills.\r\n\r\nA great depth of rain in a short time has occasionally been witnessed in\r\nEurope.  At Genoa, on the 25th of October, 1822, a depth of thirty inches\r\nof rain fell in one day.  At Joyeuse, on the 9th of October, 1827,\r\nthirty-one inches of rain fell in twenty-two hours.  Previous to the\r\ngreat floods of Moray, in 1829, the rain is described as being so thick\r\nthat the very air itself seemed to be descending in one mass of water\r\nupon the earth.  Nothing could withstand it.  The best finished windows\r\nwere ineffectual against it, and every room exposed to the north-east was\r\ndeluged.  The smaller animals, the birds, and especially game, of all\r\nkinds, were destroyed in great numbers by the rain alone, and the mother\r\npartridge, with her brood and her mate, were found chilled to death\r\namidst the drenching wet.  It was also noticed, that, as soon as the\r\nflood touched the foundation of a dry stone wall, the sods on the top of\r\nit became as it were alive with mice, all forcing their way out to escape\r\nfrom the inundation which threatened their citadel; and in the stables,\r\nwhere the water was three feet deep, rats and moles were swimming about\r\namong the buildings.\r\n\r\nAmong the Andes it is said to rain perpetually; but in Peru it never\r\nrains, moisture being supplied during a part of the year by thick fogs,\r\ncalled _garuas_.  In Egypt, and some parts of Arabia, it seldom rains at\r\nall, but the dews are heavy, and supply with moisture the few plants of\r\nthe sandy regions.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variation in the quantity of rain that falls in the same\r\nlatitude, on the different sides of the same continent, and particularly\r\nof the same island.  The mean fall of rain at Edinburgh, on the eastern\r\ncoast, is 26 inches; while at Glasgow, on the western coast, in nearly\r\nthe same latitude, it is 40 inches.  At North Shields, on the eastern\r\ncoast, it is 25 inches; while at Coniston, in Lancashire, in nearly the\r\nsame latitude, on the western coast, it is 85 inches.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rain in a district may be changed by destroying or forming\r\nforests, and by the inclosure and drainage of land.  By thinning off the\r\nwood in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, there has been a striking\r\ndecrease of rain in fifty years.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Howard's observations on the climate of this country, he has\r\nfound, on an average of years, that it rains every other day; that more\r\nrain falls in the night than in the day; that the greatest quantity of\r\nrain falls in autumn, and the least in winter; that the quantity which\r\nfalls in autumn is nearly double that in spring; that most rain falls in\r\nOctober and least in February, and that May comes nearest to the mean:\r\nthat one year in every five, in this country, may be expected to be\r\nextremely dry, and one in ten extremely wet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dalton, the mean annual amount of rain and dew for England\r\nand Wales is 36 inches.  The mean all over the globe is stated to be 34\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some real connexion between the changes of the moon and\r\nthe weather.  Mr. Daniell says, \"No observation is more general; and on\r\nno occasion, perhaps, is the almanac so frequently consulted as in\r\nforming conjectures upon the state of the weather.  The common remark,\r\nhowever, goes no further than that changes from wet to dry, and from dry\r\nto wet, generally happen at the changes of the moon.  When to this result\r\nof universal experience we add the philosophical reasons for the\r\nexistence of tides in the aerial ocean, we cannot doubt that such a\r\nconnexion exists.  The subject, however, is involved in much obscurity.\"\r\nAt Viviers, it was observed that the number of rainy days was greatest at\r\nthe first quarter, and least at the last.  Mr. Howard has observed that,\r\nin this country, when the moon has south declination, there falls but a\r\nmoderate quantity of rain, and that the quantity increases till she has\r\nattained the greatest northern declination.  He thinks there is \"evidence\r\nof a great _tidal wave_, or swell in the atmosphere, caused by the moon's\r\nattraction, preceding her in her approach to us, and following slowly as\r\nshe departs from these latitudes.\"\r\n\r\nMost dry climates are subject to periodical droughts.  In Australia, they\r\nreturn after every ten or twelve years, and are then followed by\r\nexcessive rains, which gradually become less and less till another\r\ndrought is the consequence.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Darwin was in South America, he passed through a district which\r\nhad long been suffering from dry weather.  The first rain that had fallen\r\nduring that year was on the 17th of May, when it rained lightly for about\r\nfive hours.  \"With this shower,\" he says, \"the farmers, who plant corn\r\nnear the sea-coast, where the atmosphere is more humid, would break up\r\nthe ground; with a second, put the seed in; and, if a third should fall,\r\nthey would reap in the spring a good harvest.  It was interesting to\r\nwatch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture.  Twelve hours\r\nafterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever; yet, after an interval of\r\nten days, all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches; the grass\r\nbeing sparingly scattered in hair-like fibres a full inch in length.\r\nBefore this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a high road.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this shower had fallen, Mr. Darwin took an excursion to\r\na part of the country to which the shower had not extended.  \"We had,\r\ntherefore,\" he says, \"in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge\r\nof green, which soon faded away.  Even where brightest, it was scarcely\r\nsufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers during the\r\nspring of other countries.  While travelling through these deserts, one\r\nfeels like a prisoner, shut up in a gloomy courtyard, longing to see\r\nsomething green, and to smell a moist atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe effects of a great drought in the Pampas are thus described.  \"The\r\nperiod included between the years 1827 and 1830 is called the 'gran seco'\r\nor the great drought.  During this time so little rain fell, that the\r\nvegetation, even to the thistles, failed; the brooks were dried up, and\r\nthe whole country assumed the appearance of a dusty high road.  This was\r\nespecially the case in the northern part of the province of Buenos Ayres,\r\nand the southern part of St. Fe.  Very great numbers of birds, wild\r\nanimals, cattle, and horses, perished from the want of food and water.  A\r\nman told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well\r\nwhich he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water; and\r\nthat the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued.  The\r\nlowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of Buenos Ayres\r\nalone, was taken at one million head.  A proprietor at San Pedro had\r\npreviously to these years 20,000 cattle; at the end not one remained.\r\nSan Pedro is situated in the midst of the finest country, and even now\r\nagain abounds with animals; yet, during the latter part of the 'gran\r\nseco' live cattle were brought in vessels for the consumption of the\r\ninhabitants.  The animals roamed from their _estancias_, and wandering\r\nfar to the southward, were mingled together in such multitudes that a\r\ngovernment commission was sent from Buenos Ayres to settle the disputes\r\nof the owners.  Sir Woodbine Parish informed me of another and very\r\ncurious source of dispute; the ground being so long dry, such quantities\r\nof dust were blown about, that in this open country the landmarks became\r\nobliterated, and people could not tell the limits of their estates.\r\n\r\n\"I was informed by an eye-witness, that the cattle in herds of thousands\r\nrushed into the river Parana, and being exhausted by hunger they were\r\nunable to crawl up the muddy banks, and thus were drowned.  The arm which\r\nruns by San Pedro was so full of putrid carcasses, that the master of a\r\nvessel told me, that the smell rendered it quite impossible to pass that\r\nway.  Without doubt, several hundred thousand animals thus perished in\r\nthe river.  Their bodies, when putrid, floated down the stream, and many\r\nin all probability were deposited in the estuary of the Plata.  All the\r\nsmall rivers became highly saline, and this caused the death of vast\r\nnumbers in particular spots, for when an animal drinks of such water it\r\ndoes not recover.  I noticed, but probably it was the effect of a gradual\r\nincrease, rather than of any one period, that the smaller streams in the\r\nPampas were paved with bones.  Subsequently to this unusual drought, a\r\nvery rainy season commenced, which caused great floods.  Hence it is\r\nalmost certain, that some thousands of these skeletons were buried by the\r\ndeposits of the very next year.  What would be the opinion of a geologist\r\nviewing such an enormous collection of bones, of all kinds of animals and\r\nof all ages, thus embedded in one thick earthy mass?  Would he not\r\nattribute it to a flood having crept over the surface of the land, rather\r\nthan to the common order of things?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Owen mentions a curious effect of a drought on the elephants at\r\nBenguela on the western coast of Africa:--\"A number of these animals had\r\nsome time since entered the town in a body to possess themselves of the\r\nwells, not being able to procure any water in the country.  The\r\ninhabitants mustered, when a desperate conflict ensued, which terminated\r\nin the ultimate discomfiture of the invaders, but not until they had\r\nkilled one man, and wounded several others.\"  The town is said to have a\r\npopulation of nearly three thousand.  Dr. Malcolmson states, that during\r\na great drought in India the wild animals entered the tents of some\r\ntroops at Ellore, and that a hare drank out of a vessel held by the\r\nadjutant of the regiment.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with droughts may be mentioned a plan {133} proposed by Mr.\r\nEspy of the United States of America, for remedying them by means of\r\n_artificial rains_.  That gentleman says, that if a large body of heated\r\nair be made to ascend in a column, a large cloud will be generated, and\r\nthat such cloud will contain in itself a self-sustaining power, which may\r\nmove from the place over which it was formed, and cause the air over\r\nwhich it passes to rise up into it and thus form more cloud and rain,\r\nuntil the rain may become general.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to form this ascending column of air by kindling large\r\nfires which, Mr. Espy says, are known to produce rain.  Humboldt speaks\r\nof a mysterious connexion between volcanoes and rain, and says that when\r\na volcano bursts out in South America in a dry season, it sometimes\r\nchanges it to a rainy one.  The Indians of Paraguay, when their crops are\r\nthreatened by drought, set fire to the vast plains with the intention of\r\nproducing rain.  In Louisiana, heavy rains have been known from time\r\nimmemorial to succeed the conflagration of the prairies; and the\r\ninhabitants of Nova Scotia bear testimony to a similar result from the\r\nburning of their forests.  Great battles are said to produce rain, and it\r\nis even stated that the spread of manufactures in a particular district\r\ndeteriorates the climate of such district, the ascending current\r\noccasioned by the tall chimney of every manufactory tending to produce\r\nrain.  In Manchester, for example, it is said to rain six days out of\r\nseven.\r\n\r\n             [Picture: Decorative picture of person by pool]\r\n\r\n       [Picture: Decorative picture of pastoral scene with rainbow]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAINBOW--DECOMPOSITION OF WHITE LIGHT BY THE PRISM--FORMATION OF\r\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY BOWS--RAINBOWS IN MOUNTAIN REGIONS--THE RAINBOW A\r\nSACRED EMBLEM--LUNAR RAINBOW--LIGHT DECOMPOSED BY CLOUDS--THEIR BEAUTIFUL\r\nCOLOURS--EXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nBy means of rain and rain clouds we get that beautiful appearance so well\r\nknown as the rainbow.  In order to form some idea of the manner in which\r\nthe rainbow is produced, it is necessary to know something of the manner\r\nin which light is composed.  Sir Isaac Newton was the first philosopher\r\nwho clearly explained the composition of light, as derived from the sun.\r\nHe admitted a ray of the sun into a darkened room through a small hole in\r\nthe window shutters; in front of this hole he placed a glass prism, and\r\nat a considerable distance behind the prism he placed a white screen.  If\r\nthere had been no prism between the hole and the screen, the ray of light\r\nwould have proceeded in the direction of the dotted lines, and a bright\r\nspot would have fallen upon the floor of the room, as shown in the\r\nfigure.  But the effect of the prism is to refract or bend the ray out of\r\nits ordinary course, and in doing so it does not produce a white spot\r\nupon the screen, but a long streak of beautiful colours, in the order\r\nmarked in the figure, red being at the bottom, then orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, indigo, and violet at the top.\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: Decomposition of white light]\r\n\r\nIn order to account for the production of these colours from a ray of\r\nlight, Newton supposed that such a ray is actually made up of seven\r\ndistinct colours, which being mixed in proper proportions neutralize or\r\ndestroy each other.  In order to account for the decomposition of the ray\r\nof white light by the prism, and for the lengthened form of the\r\n_spectrum_, as it is called, he supposed that each of the seven coloured\r\nrays was capable of being bent by the prism in a different manner from\r\nthe rest.  Thus, in the figure, the red appears to be less bent out of\r\nthe direction of the original ray than the orange--the orange less than\r\nthe yellow, and so on until we arrive at the violet, which is bent most\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark, that these views were found to be\r\ncorrect, except as regards the number of colours in the solar spectrum;\r\nfor it is now ascertained, with tolerable certainty, that there are only\r\nthree primitive or pure colours in nature, and these are _red_, _yellow_,\r\nand _blue_; and it is supposed that by mingling two or more of these\r\ncolours in various proportions, all the colours in nature are produced.\r\n\r\nNow, to apply this explanation to the production of the rainbow, which is\r\nusually seen under the following circumstances:--The observer is placed\r\nwith his back to the sun, and at some distance before him rain is\r\nfalling,--the air between the sun and the rain being tolerably clear.  He\r\nthen often sees two circular arcs or bows immediately in front of him.\r\nThe colours of the inner bow are the more striking and vivid of the two.\r\nEach exhibits the same series of colours as in the spectrum formed by the\r\nprism; namely, _red_, _orange_, _yellow_, _green_, _blue_, _indigo_, and\r\n_violet_; but the arrangement of these colours is different in the two\r\nbows, for while in the inner bow the lower edge is violet and the upper\r\nred, in the outer bow the lower edge is red and the upper violet.  The\r\nproduction of both bows is due to the refraction and reflexion of light,\r\nthe drops of rain forming, in fact, the prism which decomposes the white\r\nlight of the sun.  The colours in the rainbow have the same proportional\r\nbreadth as the spaces in the prismatic spectrum.  \"The bow is,\r\ntherefore,\" as Sir D. Brewster remarks, \"only an infinite number of\r\nprismatic spectra, arranged in the circumference of a circle; and it\r\nwould be easy, by a circular arrangement of prisms, or by covering up all\r\nthe central part of a large lens, to produce a small arch of exactly the\r\nsame colours.  All we require, therefore, to form a rainbow, is a great\r\nnumber of transparent bodies capable of forming a great number of\r\nprismatic spectra from the light of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the drops of rain act as prisms, may, perhaps, be\r\nbetter understood with the assistance of the following diagram.  Suppose\r\nthe two lower circles to represent drops of rain which assist in forming\r\nthe primary bow, and the two upper circles similar drops which help to\r\nproduce the secondary bow; and let S represent rays of the sun falling\r\nupon them.  The rays of the sun fall upon every part of the drop; but, as\r\nthose which pass through or near the centre come out on the opposite side\r\nand form a focus, they need not be taken into account.  Those rays,\r\nhowever, which fall on the upper side of the drops, will be bent or\r\nrefracted, the red rays least, and the violet most; and will fall upon\r\nthe back of the drop in such a manner as to be reflected to the under\r\npart of the drop; on quitting which they will be again refracted, so as\r\nto be seen at E, where there will appear to the observer a prismatic\r\nspectrum with the red uppermost, and the violet undermost.  These remarks\r\napply to those drops only which form the upper part of the bow, but it is\r\nobvious that a similar reasoning applied to the drops to the right and\r\nleft of the observer, will complete the bow.  The inclination of the red\r\nray and the violet ray to the sun's rays, is 42 degrees 2' for the red,\r\nand 40 degrees 17' for the violet, so that the breadth of the primary bow\r\nis 1 degrees 45'.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, that the primary bow is produced by two\r\nrefractions, and one intermediate reflection of the rays that fall on the\r\nupper sides of the drops of rain.  It is different with the rays which\r\nenter the drops below.  The red and violet rays will be bent or refracted\r\nin different directions; and, after being twice reflected, will be again\r\nbent towards the eye of the observer at E; but in this case the violet\r\nforms the upper part, and the red the under part of the spectrum.  The\r\ninclination of these rays to the sun's rays at S, is 50 degrees 58' for\r\nthe red ray, and 54 degrees 10' for the violet ray; so that the breadth\r\nof the bow is 3 degrees 10', and the distance between the primary and\r\nsecondary bows is 8 degrees 15'.  Hence the secondary is formed in the\r\noutside of the primary bow, with its colours reversed, in consequence of\r\ntheir being produced by two reflexions and two refractions.  The colours\r\nof the secondary bow are much fainter than those of the primary, because\r\nthey undergo two reflexions instead of one.\r\n\r\nThere is something very wonderful in the rapidity and perfection with\r\nwhich these natural prisms, the falling drops of rain, produce these\r\neffects.  In the inconceivably short space of time occupied by a drop\r\nfalling through those parts of the sky which form the proper angles with\r\nthe sun's rays and the eye of the observer, the light enters the surface\r\nof the drop, undergoes within it one or two reflexions, two refractions\r\nand decompositions, and has reached the eye; and all this is done in a\r\nportion of time too small for the drop to have fallen through a space\r\nwhich we have the means of measuring.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood, that since the eyes of different observers cannot\r\nbe in precisely the same place at the same time, no two observers can see\r\nthe _same_ rainbow; that is to say, the bow produced by one set of drops\r\nto the eye of one observer is produced by another set of drops to the eye\r\nof another observer.\r\n\r\nA rainbow can never be greater than a semicircle, unless the spectator is\r\non elevated ground; for if it were greater than a semicircle the centre\r\nof the bow would be above the horizon, while the sun, which must be in a\r\nline drawn through that centre and the eye of the observer, would be\r\nbelow the horizon: but in such a case, the sun could not shine on the\r\ndrops of rain, and consequently there could be no rainbow.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain cloud is of small extent only a portion of a bow is\r\nvisible; when the cloud overspreads a large part of the sky a perfect bow\r\nappears.  Sometimes the bow may be traced across a portion of blue sky,\r\nor it may appear to rest on the ground.  In the former case, there are\r\nvapours in the air too thin to be seen, but sufficient to refract and\r\nreflect the rays of light; in the latter, the drops of rain, adhering to\r\nthe grass and foliage, produce the same effect.  A coloured bow, similar\r\nto that produced by rain, is sometimes seen in the spray of a fountain or\r\nof a water-fall, and also in mists that lie low upon the ground.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous and stormy regions rainbows are often seen to great\r\nadvantage.  In the islands off the Irish coast the author of \"Letters\r\nfrom the Irish Islands,\" describes the rainbow of winter \"as gradually\r\nadvancing before the lowering clouds, sweeping with majestic stride\r\nacross the troubled ocean, then, as it gained the beach, and seemed\r\nalmost within one's grasp, vanishing amid the storm of which it had been\r\nthe lovely but treacherous forerunner.  It is, I suppose, a consequence\r\nof our situation, and the close connexion between sea and mountain, that\r\nthe rainbows here are so frequent and so peculiarly beautiful.  Of an\r\namazing breadth, and of colours vivid beyond description, I know not\r\nwhether most to admire this aerial phenomenon, when suspended in the\r\nwestern sky, one end of the bow sinks behind the Island of Boffin, while\r\nat the distance of several leagues the other rests upon the misty hills\r\nof Ennis Turc; or when, at a later hour of the day, it has appeared\r\nstretched across the ample sides of Mulbrea, penetrating far into the\r\ndeep blue waters that flow at its base.  With feelings of grateful\r\nrecollection, too, we may hail the repeated visits of this heavenly\r\nmessenger, occasionally as often as five or six times in the course of\r\nthe same day, in a country exposed to such astonishing, and, at times,\r\nalmost incessant floods of rain.\"\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the rainbow is not the only reason why we should regard it\r\nwith interest.  The rainbow was appointed by God himself as a sign of the\r\ncovenant of mercy, made with Noah and with all mankind, after the flood.\r\nThe words in which this declaration was made to mankind, are recorded in\r\nthe Book of Genesis, chap. ix. ver. 11 to 16.\r\n\r\nBurnet, in his \"Sacred Theory of the Earth,\" has some remarks on the\r\nfirst appearance of the rainbow to the inhabitants of the earth after the\r\ndeluge.  He says, \"How proper and how apposite a sign would this be for\r\nProvidence to pitch upon, to confirm the promise made to Noah and his\r\nposterity, that the world should be no more destroyed by water!  It had a\r\nsecret connexion with the effect itself, and was so far a natural sign;\r\nbut, however, appearing first after the deluge, and in a watery cloud,\r\nthere was, methinks, a great easiness and propriety of application for\r\nsuch a purpose.  And if we suppose, that while God Almighty was declaring\r\nhis promise to Noah, and the sign of it, there appeared at the same time\r\nin the clouds a fair rainbow, that marvellous and beautiful meteor which\r\nNoah had never seen before; it could not but make a most lively\r\nimpression upon him, quickening his faith, and giving him comfort and\r\nassurance that God would be stedfast to his promise.\"\r\n\r\nA rainbow is sometimes formed by the rays of the moon falling upon drops\r\nof rain, in the same manner as the solar rays, and refracted and\r\nreflected by the drops; but the colours are faint in consequence of the\r\nfeeble light of the moon compared with that of the sun.  A lunar rainbow\r\nhas been thus described by an observer:--\"The moon was truly 'walking in\r\nbrightness,' brilliant as she could be, not a cloud was to be seen near\r\nher; and over against her, toward the north-west, or perhaps rather more\r\nto the north, was a rainbow, a vast arch, perfect in all its parts, not\r\ninterrupted or broken as rainbows frequently are, but unremittedly\r\nvisible from one horizon to the other.  In order to give some idea of its\r\nextent, it is necessary to say, that, as I stood toward the western\r\nextremity of the parish of Stoke Newington, it seemed to take its rise\r\nfrom the west of Hampstead, and to end perhaps in the river Lea, the\r\neastern boundary of Tottenham.  Its colour was white, cloudy, or greyish,\r\nbut a part of its western limb seemed to exhibit tints of a faint sickly\r\ngreen.  After some time the moon became darkened by clouds, and the\r\nrainbow of course vanished.\"\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: Lunar Rainbow]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant colours of the solar rainbow are frequently produced by the\r\nclouds without any prismatic arrangement.  The light of the sun is\r\ndecomposed by a process called absorption: for example, white light is\r\ncomposed of red, yellow, and blue rays, in certain proportions; now, if\r\nin passing through, or falling upon any substance whatever, the red rays\r\nare stifled or absorbed, while the yellow and blue are allowed to pass or\r\nto be reflected, it is obvious that such a substance cannot appear white,\r\nbecause one of the elements of white light, namely, the red, is wanting;\r\nit must therefore appear of such a colour as results from the combination\r\nof yellow and blue; the substance will therefore appear green.  So, also,\r\nwhen white light falls upon what we call a _red_ surface, the yellow and\r\nblue rays are stifled or absorbed, leaving the red only to be reflected.\r\nNow, when we consider the various ways in which this absorption may take\r\nplace; one or two, or all of the coloured rays being absorbed in every\r\npossible proportion, it is easy to form some idea of the manner by which\r\nthe innumerable tints of the sky are produced.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated, that, of the horizontal sunbeams which pass\r\nthrough two hundred miles of air, scarcely a two thousandth part reaches\r\nthe earth.  A densely formed cloud must therefore detain a much larger\r\nshare; and those dark and sombre forms, which sometimes make the sky so\r\ngloomy, can only result from the abundant absorption of the solar light.\r\nThe brilliant whiteness which their edges occasionally exhibit, must\r\nresult from the more copious transmission of light, so that the depths of\r\nshade in a cloud may be regarded as comparative measures of the varied\r\nthickness of its mass.\r\n\r\nSometimes the clouds absorb equally all the solar rays, in which case the\r\nsun and moon appear through them perfectly white.  Instances are recorded\r\nin which the sun appeared of a pale blue.  It has also been observed to\r\nbe orange at its upper part, while the lower was of a brilliant red.\r\n\r\nThe position from which clouds are seen, has much to do with their\r\ncolours; and it seems difficult sometimes to believe that the clouds,\r\nwhich in the evening are seen drenched with crimson and gold, are the\r\nsame we beheld absolutely colourless in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the sun the most brilliant colours may\r\nbe disclosed; and their vividness and intensity diminish, and at last\r\ndisappear at some distance from it.  Parry noticed some white fleecy\r\nclouds, which, at the distance of fifteen or twenty degrees from the sun,\r\nreflected from their edges the most soft and tender tints of yellow,\r\nbluish green, and lake; and as the clouds advanced the colours increased\r\ngradually, until they reached a sort of limit two degrees below the solar\r\norb.  As the current continued to transport them, the vividness of colour\r\nbecame weakened by almost insensible degrees until the whole assemblage\r\nof tints vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Who can venture to imitate, by the pencil, the endless varieties of red\r\nand orange and yellow which the setting sun discloses, and the magical\r\nillusions which all the day diversify the vast and varied space the eye\r\ntravels over in rising gradually from the horizon to the upper sky?\r\nThose who have paid any attention to colours, must be aware of the\r\ndifficulty of describing the various tints and shades that appear, and\r\nwhich are known to amount to many thousands.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapid changes of colour which the clouds undergo, seem to depend on\r\nsomething more than change of position either in the cloud or in the sun.\r\nForster mentions an instance of some detached cirro-cumuli being of a\r\nfine golden yellow, but in a single minute becoming deep red.  On another\r\noccasion he saw the exact counterpart in a cirro-stratus, by its\r\ninstantly changing from a beautiful red to a bright golden yellow.\r\n\"What, indeed, can be more interesting, than when by the breaking out of\r\nthe sun in gleams, a cloud which a moment before seemed only an\r\nunshapened mass devoid of all interest and beauty, is suddenly pierced by\r\ncataracts of light, and imbued with the most splendid colours, varying\r\nevery instant in intensity?  Numerous examples occur of this beautiful\r\nplay of colour, which cannot but remind us of the phenomena displayed by\r\nthe pigeon's neck and the peacock's tail, by opal and pearl.\r\n\r\n\"After the sun is set, the mild glow of his rays is still diffused over\r\nevery part; and it has been remarked, that the clouds assume their\r\nbrightest and most splendid colours a few minutes after it is below the\r\nhorizon.  It is in the finest weather that the colouring of the sky\r\npresents the most perfect examples of harmony, in tempestuous weather it\r\nbeing almost always inharmonious.  At the time of a warm sun-setting, the\r\nwhole hemisphere is influenced by the prevailing colour of the light.\r\nThe snowy summits of the Alps appear about sunset of a most beautiful\r\nviolet colour, approaching to light crimson or pink.  It is remarkable,\r\nalso, as an example of that general harmony which prevails in the\r\nmaterial world, that the most glowing and magnificent skies occur when\r\nterrestrial objects put on their deepest and most splendid hues.  It has\r\nalso been observed, that it is not the change of vegetation only, which\r\ngives to the decaying charms of autumn their finest and most golden hues,\r\nbut also the atmosphere and the peculiar lights and shadows which then\r\nprevail; and there can be no doubt, on the other hand, that our\r\nperception of beauty in the sky is very much influenced by the\r\nsurrounding scenery.  In autumn all is matured; and the rich hues of the\r\nripened fruits and the changing foliage are rendered still more lovely by\r\nthe warm haze which a fine day at that season presents.  So, also, the\r\nearlier hues of spring have a transparency, and a thousand quivering\r\nlights, which in their turn harmonize with the light and flitting clouds\r\nand uncertain shadows which then prevail.\" {155}\r\n\r\n              [Picture: Decorative picture of lady by river]\r\n\r\n [Picture: Foot-print of a bird, and impression of rain-drops sand-stone]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE SHOWERS--SHOWERS OF SAND--OF MUD--SHOWERS OF SULPHUR, OR\r\nYELLOW RAIN--LUMINOUS RAIN--RED RAIN, OR SHOWERS OF BLOOD--SUPERSTITIONS\r\nCONNECTED THEREWITH--EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE--SHOWERS OF FISH--SHOWERS\r\nOF RATS--SHOWERS OF FROGS--INSECT SHOWER--SHOWERS OF VEGETABLE\r\nSUBSTANCES--MANNA--WHEAT--SHOWERS OF STONES--METEORIC STONES, OR\r\nAEROLITES--METEORIC IRON--SUPPOSITIONS RESPECTING THEM--FOSSIL RAIN.\r\n\r\nWater, in the state of rain, hail, snow, or dew, is generally the only\r\nsubstance which falls from the atmosphere upon the earth.  There are,\r\nhowever, many well authenticated instances of various substances being\r\nshowered down upon the land, to the great alarm of persons who were\r\nignorant that the powerful action of the wind was, perhaps, the chief\r\ncause of the strange visitations to which we allude.\r\n\r\nWe read of showers of sand, mud, sulphur, blood, fishes, frogs, insects,\r\nand stones; and it may be useful, as well as interesting, to quote a few\r\nexamples of each description of shower.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of Africa, between Cape Bojador and Cape Verd, and\r\nthence outwards, the land, during the dry season, consists of little else\r\nbut dust or sand, which, on account of its extreme fineness, is raised\r\ninto the atmosphere by the slightest current of air; while a moderate\r\nwind will convey it to so considerable a distance as even to annoy ships\r\ncrossing the Atlantic.  On the 14th and 15th January, 1839, the Prussian\r\nship, _Princess Louisa_, being in N. lat. 24 degrees 20', and W. long. 26\r\ndegrees 42', had her sails made quite yellow by the fine sand which\r\ncovered them.  This effect was produced when the distance from land was\r\nas much as from 12 to 20 degrees.  About a fortnight after the time when\r\nthis ship crossed these parts of the Atlantic, a similar effect was\r\nproduced on board the English ship _Roxburgh_.  One of the passengers,\r\nthe Rev. W. B. Clarke, says:--\"The sky was overcast, and the weather\r\nthick and insufferably oppressive, though the thermometer was only 72\r\ndegrees.  At 3 P.M. Feb. 4, the wind suddenly lulled into a calm; then\r\nrose from the SW. accompanied by rain, and the air appeared to be filled\r\nwith dust, which affected the eyes of the passengers and crew.  The\r\nweather was clear and fine, and the powder which covered the sails was of\r\na reddish-brown colour, resembling the ashes ejected from Vesuvius; and\r\nMr. Clarke thinks that this dust may have proceeded from the volcanic\r\nisland of Fogo, one of the Cape de Verds, about forty-five miles from the\r\nplace where the ship then was.\r\n\r\nIn countries which are subject to long-continued droughts the soil is\r\nfrequently converted into dust, which, being carried away by the winds,\r\nleaves the land barren.  The climate of Buenos Ayres, in South America,\r\nhas of late years been subject to such droughts, as to disappoint the\r\nhopes of the husbandman and the breeder of cattle.  In the early part of\r\n1832, the drought had reached to such a height as to convert the whole\r\nprovince into one continued bleak and dreary desert.  The clouds of dust\r\nraised by the winds were so dense as completely to obscure the sun at\r\nmid-day, and envelope the inhabitants in almost total darkness.  When the\r\nrains at length commenced, in March, the water, in its passage through\r\nthe air, intermingled so completely with the dust suspended in it, as to\r\ndescend in the form of showers of mud; and, on some occasions, gave to\r\nthe whole exterior of the houses the appearance of having been plastered\r\nover with earth.  Many flocks of sheep were smothered on these occasions,\r\nin a similar manner as in the snow-storms which occur in the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Scotland.\r\n\r\nShowers of sulphur, or yellow rain, have fallen at different times in\r\nvarious parts of Europe; and sometimes, when falling by night, they have\r\nappeared luminous, to the great alarm of the observers.  Yellow rain has\r\nbeen accounted for in the following way:--The pollen, or impregnating\r\nseed-dust of the flowers of the fir, birch, juniper, and other trees, is\r\nof a yellow colour, and this pollen, by the action of the wind, is\r\ncarried to a considerable distance, and descends with falling rain.  This\r\nyellow rain has also been found impregnated with sulphur; and during a\r\nshower of this kind which once fell in Germany, matches were made by\r\nbeing dipped in it.\r\n\r\nMany examples of luminous rain are recorded on good authority.  One of\r\nthe latest instances is mentioned by Dr. Morel Deville, of Paris, who on\r\nthe 1st of November, 1844, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening,\r\nduring a heavy fall of rain, noticed, as he was crossing the court of the\r\nCollege Louis-le-Grand, that the drops, on coming in contact with the\r\nground, emitted sparks and tufts (_aigrettes_) of light, accompanied by a\r\nrustling and crackling noise; a smell of phosphorus having been\r\nimmediately after perceptible.  The phenomenon was seen three times.  At\r\nthe same hour a remarkable brightness was seen in the northern sky.\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Algerian army states, that during a violent storm on\r\nthe 20th September, 1840, the drops of rain that fell on the beards and\r\nmustachios of the men were luminous.  When the hair was wiped the\r\nappearance ceased; but was renewed the moment any fresh drops fell on it.\r\n\r\nBut of all these remarkable showers, the greatest alarm has been\r\noccasioned by _red rain_, or showers of blood as they have been\r\nignorantly called.  In the year 1608, considerable alarm was excited in\r\nthe city of Aix and its vicinity by the appearance of large red drops\r\nupon the walls of the cemetery of the greater church, which is near the\r\nwalls of the city, upon the walls of the city itself, and also upon the\r\nwalls of villas, hamlets, and towns, for some miles round the city.  The\r\nhusbandmen are said to have been so alarmed, that they left their labour\r\nin the fields and fled for safety into the neighbouring houses; and a\r\nreport was set on foot, that the appearance was produced by demons or\r\nwitches shedding the blood of innocent babes.  M. Peiresc, thinking this\r\nstory of a bloody shower to be scarcely reconcileable with the goodness\r\nand providence of God, accidentally discovered, as he thought, the true\r\ncause of the phenomenon.  He had found, some months before, a chrysalis\r\nof remarkable size and form, which he had enclosed in a box; he thought\r\nno more of it, until hearing a buzz within the box, he opened it, and\r\nperceived that the chrysalis had been changed into a beautiful butterfly,\r\nwhich immediately flew away, leaving at the bottom of the box a red drop\r\nof the size of a shilling.  As this happened about the time when the\r\nshower was supposed to have fallen, and when multitudes of those insects\r\nwere observed fluttering through the air in every direction, he concluded\r\nthat the drops in question were emitted by them when they alighted upon\r\nthe walls.  He, therefore, examined the drops again, and remarked that\r\nthey were not upon the upper surfaces of stones and buildings, as they\r\nwould have been if a shower of blood had fallen from the sky, but rather\r\nin cavities and holes where insects might nestle.  He also noticed that\r\nthey were to be seen upon the walls of those houses only which were near\r\nthe fields; and not upon the more elevated parts of them, but only up to\r\nthe same moderate height at which butterflies were accustomed to flutter.\r\nThis was, no doubt, the correct explanation of the phenomenon in\r\nquestion; for it is a curious and well-ascertained fact, that when\r\ninsects are evolved from the pupa state, they always discharge some\r\nsubstance, which, in many butterflies, is of a red colour, resembling\r\nblood, while in several moths it is orange or whitish.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from the researches of M. Ehrenberg, a distinguished\r\nmicroscopic observer, that the appearances of blood which have at\r\ndifferent times been observed in Arabia, Siberia, and other places, are\r\nnot to be attributed to one, but to various causes.  From his account, it\r\nappears that rivers have flowed suddenly with red or bloody water,\r\nwithout any previous rain of that colour having fallen; that lakes or\r\nstagnant-waters were suddenly or gradually coloured without previous\r\nblood-rain; that dew, rain, snow, hail, and shot-stars, occasionally fall\r\nfrom the air red-coloured, as blood-dew, blood-rain, and clotted blood;\r\nand, lastly, that the atmosphere is occasionally loaded with red dust, by\r\nwhich the rain accidentally assumes the appearance of blood-rain, in\r\nconsequence of which rivers and stagnant waters assume a red colour.\r\n\r\nThe blood-red colour sometimes exhibited by pools, was first\r\nsatisfactorily explained at the close of the last century.  Girod\r\nChantran, observing the water of a pond to be of a brilliant red colour,\r\nexamined it with the microscope, and found that the sanguine hue resulted\r\nfrom the presence of innumerable animalculae, not visible to the naked\r\neye.  But, before this investigation, Linnaeus and other naturalists had\r\nshown that red infusoria were capable of giving that colour to water\r\nwhich, in early times, and still, we fear, in remote districts, was\r\nsupposed to forebode great calamities.  In the year 1815 an instance of\r\nthis superstitious dread occurred in the south of Prussia.  A number of\r\nred, violet, or grass-green spots were observed in a lake near Lubotin,\r\nabout the end of harvest.  In winter the ice was coloured in the same\r\nmanner at the surface, while beneath it was colourless.  The inhabitants,\r\nin great dismay, anticipated a variety of disasters from the appearance;\r\nbut it fortunately happened that the celebrated chemist Klaproth, hearing\r\nof the circumstance, undertook an examination of the waters of the lake.\r\nHe found them to contain an albuminous vegetable matter, with a\r\nparticular colouring matter similar to indigo, produced, probably, by the\r\ndecomposition of vegetables in harvest; while the change of colour from\r\ngreen to violet and red, he explained by the absorption of more or less\r\noxygen.  A few years ago the blood-red waters of a Siberian lake were\r\ncarefully examined by M. Ehrenberg, and found to contain multitudes of\r\ninfusoria, by the presence of which this remarkable appearance was\r\naccounted for.  Thus it appears that both animals and vegetables are\r\nconcerned in giving a peculiar tint to water.  It has also been\r\nascertained that red snow is chiefly occasioned by the presence of red\r\nanimalculae.\r\n\r\nShowers of fish and frogs are by no means uncommon, especially in India.\r\nOne of these showers, which fell about twenty miles south of Calcutta, is\r\nthus noticed by an observer:--\"About two o'clock, P.M., of the 20th\r\ninst., (Sept. 1839,) we had a very smart shower of rain, and with it\r\ndescended a quantity of live fish, about three inches in length, and all\r\nof one kind only.  They fell in a straight line on the road from my house\r\nto the tank which is about forty or fifty yards distant.  Those which\r\nfell on the hard ground were, as a matter of course, killed from the\r\nfall, but those which fell where there was grass sustained no injury; and\r\nI picked up a large quantity of them, 'alive and kicking,' and let them\r\ngo into my tank.  The most strange thing that ever struck me in connexion\r\nwith this event, was, that the fish did not fall helter skelter,\r\neverywhere, or 'here and there;' but they fell in a straight line, not\r\nmore than a cubit in breadth.\"  Another shower is said to have taken\r\nplace at a village near Allahabad, in the month of May.  About noon, the\r\nwind being in the west, and a few distant clouds visible, a blast of high\r\nwind came on, accompanied with so much dust as to change the tint of the\r\natmosphere to a reddish hue.  The blast appeared to extend in breadth\r\nfour hundred yards, and was so violent that many large trees were blown\r\ndown.  When the storm had passed over, the ground, south of the village,\r\nwas found to be covered with fish, not less than three or four thousand\r\nin number.  They all belonged to a species well known in India, and were\r\nabout a span in length.  They were all dead and dry.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply these examples to almost any extent,\r\nalthough they are not so frequent in Great Britain.  It is related in\r\nHasted's History of Kent, that about Easter, 1666, in the parish of\r\nStanstead, which is a considerable distance from the sea, and a place\r\nwhere there are no fishponds, and rather a scarcity of water, a pasture\r\nfield was scattered all over with small fish, supposed to have been\r\nrained down during a thunder-storm.  Several of these fish were sold\r\npublicly at Maidstone and Dartford.  In the year 1830, the inhabitants of\r\nthe island of Ula, in Argyleshire, after a day of very hard rain, which\r\noccurred on the 9th March, were surprised to find numbers of small\r\nherrings strewed over the fields, perfectly fresh and some of them alive.\r\nSome years ago, during a strong gale, herrings and other fish were\r\ncarried from the Frith of Forth so far as Loch-Leven.\r\n\r\nIn some countries rats migrate in vast numbers from the high to the low\r\ncountries; and it is recorded in the history of Norway, that a shower of\r\nthese, transported by the wind, fell in an adjacent valley.\r\n\r\nSeveral notices have, from time to time, been brought before the French\r\nAcademy, of showers of frogs having fallen in different parts of France.\r\nProfessor Pontus, of Cahors, states, that in August, 1804, while distant\r\nthree leagues from Toulouse, the sky being clear, suddenly a very thick\r\ncloud covered the horizon, and thunder and lightning came on.  The cloud\r\nburst over the road about sixty toises (383 feet) from the place where M.\r\nPontus was.  Two gentlemen, returning from Toulouse, were surprised by\r\nbeing exposed not only to a storm, but to a shower of frogs.  Pontus\r\nstates that he saw the young frogs on their cloaks.  When the diligence\r\nin which he was travelling, arrived at the place where the storm burst,\r\nthe road, and the fields alongside of it, were observed full of frogs, in\r\nthree or four layers placed one above the other.  The feet of the horses\r\nand the wheels of the carriage killed thousands.  The diligence travelled\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, at least, along this living road, the horses\r\nbeing at a trot.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Journal de St. Petersburg,\" is given an account of the fall of a\r\nshower of insects during a snow-storm in Russia.  \"On the 17th October,\r\n1827, there fell in the district of Rjev, in the government of Tver, a\r\nheavy shower of snow, in the space of about ten versts (nearly seven\r\nEnglish miles), which contained the village of Pakroff and its environs.\r\nIt was accompanied in its fall by a prodigious quantity of worms of a\r\nblack colour, ringed, and in length about an inch and a quarter.  The\r\nhead of these insects was flat and shining, furnished with antennae, and\r\nthe hair in the form of whiskers; while the body, from the head to about\r\none-third of their length, resembled a band of black velvet.  They had on\r\neach side three feet, by means of which they appeared to crawl very fast\r\nupon the snow, and assembled in groups about the plants and the holes in\r\ntrees and buildings.  Several having been exposed to the air in a vessel\r\nfilled with snow, lived there till the 26th October; although, in that\r\ninterval, the thermometer had fallen to eight degrees below zero.  Some\r\nothers which had been frozen continued alive equally long; for they were\r\nnot found exactly encrusted with the ice, but they had formed round their\r\nbodies a space similar to the hollow of a tree.  When they were plunged\r\ninto water they swam about as if they had received no injury; but those\r\nwhich were carried into a warm place perished in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAll these remarkable showers may be accounted for, when we consider the\r\nmighty power of the wind; especially that form of it which is popularly\r\ncalled the whirlwind.  It is now pretty well ascertained, that in all, or\r\nmost of the great storms which agitate the atmosphere, the wind has a\r\ncircular or rotatory movement; and the same is probably the case in many\r\nof the lesser storms, in which the air is whirled upwards in a spiral\r\ncurve with great velocity, carrying up any small bodies which may come\r\nwithin the circuit.  When such a storm happens at sea, the water-spout is\r\nproduced.  In the deserts of Arabia, pillars of sand are formed; and, in\r\nother places various light bodies are caught up; fishponds have been\r\nentirely emptied in an instant, and the moving column, whether of water,\r\nsand, or air, travels with the wind with great swiftness.  When, however,\r\nthe storm has subsided, the various substances thus caught up and\r\nsustained in the air, are deposited at great distances from the place\r\nwhere they were first found, and thus produce these remarkable showers.\r\nIn some cases, however, the direct force of the wind has actually blown\r\nsmall fish out of the water, and conveyed them several miles inland.\r\n\r\nShowers of nutritious substances have been recorded on good authority.\r\nWe do not here refer to the manna which fell in such abundance about the\r\nHebrew camp, for that was a miracle specially wrought by the Almighty for\r\nthe preservation of his chosen people; but, it may be noticed here, that\r\nin Arabia, a substance, called \"manna,\" is found in great abundance on\r\nthe leaves of many trees and herbs, and may be gathered and removed by\r\nthe wind to a distance.  A shower of this kind occurred in 1824.  In\r\n1828, a substance was exhibited at the French Academy, which fell in the\r\nplains of Persia.  It was eaten, and afforded nourishment to cattle, and\r\nmany other animals; and, on examination, proved to be a vegetable,--the\r\n_Lichen esculentus_,--which had been conveyed thither by the winds.\r\n\r\nIn the Minutes of the proceedings of the Royal Society, 26th June, 1661,\r\nwe find the following curious narration:--\r\n\r\n    \"Col. Tuke brought, in writing, the following _brief account of the\r\n    supposed rain of wheat_, which was registered:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the 30th of May, 1661, Mr. Henry Puckering, son to Sir Henry\r\n    Puckering, of Warwick, brought some papers of seeds, resembling\r\n    wheat, to the king, with a letter written by Mr. William Halyburton,\r\n    dated the 27th May, from Warwick; out of which letter I have made\r\n    this extract:\r\n\r\n    \"'Instead of news I send you some papers of wonders.  On Saturday\r\n    last, it was rumoured in this town, that it rained wheat at\r\n    Tuchbrooke, a village about two miles from Warwick.  Whereupon some\r\n    of the inhabitants of this town went thither; where they saw great\r\n    quantities on the way, in the fields, and on the leads of the church,\r\n    castle, and priory, and upon the hearths of the chimneys in the\r\n    chambers.  And Arthur Mason, coming out of Shropshire, reports, that\r\n    it hath rained the like in many places of that county.  God make us\r\n    thankful for this miraculous blessing, &.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"I brought some papers of these seeds, with this letter, to the\r\n    Society of Gresham College; who would not enter into any\r\n    consideration of it, till they were better informed of the matter of\r\n    fact.  Hereupon, I entreated Mr. Henry Puckering to write to the\r\n    bailiff of the town of Warwick, to the ministers and physicians, to\r\n    send us an account of the matter of fact, and their opinions of it.\r\n    In the bailiff's letter, dated the 3rd of June, I find this report\r\n    verified; affirming that himself, with the inhabitants of the town,\r\n    were in a great astonishment at this wonder.  But, before the next\r\n    day of our meeting, I sent for some ivy-berries, and brought them to\r\n    Gresham College with some of these seeds resembling wheat; and taking\r\n    off the outward pulp of the ivy-berries, we found in each of the\r\n    berries four seeds; which were generally concluded by the Society to\r\n    be the same with those that were supposed and believed by the common\r\n    people to have been wheat that had been rained; and, that they were\r\n    brought to those places, where they were found, by starlings; who, of\r\n    all the birds that we know, do assemble in the greatest numbers; and\r\n    do, at this time of the year, feed upon these berries; and digesting\r\n    the outward pulp, they render these seeds by casting, as hawks do\r\n    feathers and bones.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarkable showers already noticed, have excited much interest and\r\ninquiry among learned men, and many superstitious fears among the\r\nignorant; but, there is another description of shower which affords a\r\nsingular instance of popular observation, being greatly in advance of\r\nscientific knowledge.  We allude to the showers of stones, called\r\n\"aerolites,\" (from two Greek words, signifying the _atmosphere_, and a\r\n_stone_); they are also called _Meteorolites_, or _Meteoric stones_.\r\n\r\nWriters in all ages have mentioned instances of stony bodies having been\r\nseen to fall from the sky.  The Chinese and Japanese carefully note down\r\nthe most striking and remarkable phenomena of nature, believing them to\r\nhave some connexion with public affairs; and the chronicles of these\r\npeople are said to contain many notices of the fall of stony bodies from\r\nthe sky.  Until within the last fifty years, however, these accounts have\r\nbeen treated in Europe as idle superstitions; scientific men denying even\r\nthe probability of such an occurrence.  The first scientific man who was\r\nbold enough to support the popular opinion, that stones actually do fall\r\nfrom the sky, was Chladni, a German philosopher, who published a pamphlet\r\non the subject in 1794.  This did not excite much attention, until, two\r\nyears afterwards, a stone weighing fifty-six pounds was exhibited in\r\nLondon, which was said to have fallen in Yorkshire in the December of the\r\npreceding year; but, although the fact was attested by several\r\nrespectable persons, the possibility of such an occurrence was still\r\ndoubted.  It was remarked, however, by Sir Joseph Banks, that this stone\r\nwas very similar in appearance to one which had been sent to him from\r\nItaly, with an account of its having fallen from the clouds.  In the year\r\n1799, a number of stones were received by the Royal Society, from\r\nBenares, in the East Indies, which were also said to have fallen from the\r\natmosphere, with a minute account of the circumstances attending the\r\nfall, which will be presently noticed; and, as these stones appeared to\r\nbe precisely similar to the Yorkshire stone already noticed, attention\r\nwas fairly drawn to the subject.  In 1802, Mr. Howard published an\r\nanalysis of a variety of these stones collected from different places;\r\nand his researches led to the important conclusion, that they are all\r\ncomposed of the same substances, and in nearly the same proportions.  In\r\n1803, a notice was received at Paris, of a shower of stones at L'Aigle in\r\nNormandy; and the Institute of France deputed M. Biot, a well-known and\r\nexcellent natural philosopher, to examine, on the spot, all the\r\ncircumstances attending this remarkable event.  His account will be\r\nnoticed presently; but it may here be stated, that the stones he\r\ncollected, on being analysed, gave results similar to those obtained by\r\nMr. Howard.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the fall of stones at Krakhut, a village\r\nabout fourteen miles from the city of Benares, are briefly as follow:--On\r\nthe 19th December, 1798, a very luminous meteor was observed in the\r\nheavens, about eight o'clock in the evening, in the form of a large ball\r\nof fire; it was accompanied by a loud noise, resembling that of thunder,\r\nwhich was immediately followed by the sound of the fall of heavy bodies.\r\nOn examining the ground, it was observed to have been newly torn up in\r\nmany places; and in these were found stones of a peculiar appearance,\r\nmost of which had buried themselves to the depth of six inches.  At the\r\ntime the meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly serene, not the smallest\r\nvestige of a cloud had been seen since the 11th of the month; nor were\r\nany observed for many days after.  It was seen in the western part of the\r\nhemisphere, and was visible only a short time.  The light from it was so\r\ngreat, as to cast a strong shadow from the bars of a window upon a dark\r\ncarpet.  Mr. Davis, the judge and magistrate of the district, affirmed,\r\nthat in brilliancy it equalled the brightest moonlight.  Both he and Mr.\r\nErskine were induced to send persons in whom they could confide to the\r\nspot where this shower of stones is reported to have taken place, and\r\nthus obtained additional evidence of the phenomena, together with several\r\nof the stones which had penetrated about six inches into fields recently\r\nwatered.  Mr. Maclane, a gentleman who resided near Krakhut, presented\r\nMr. Howard with a portion of a stone which had been brought to him the\r\nmorning after its fall by the person who was on duty at his house, and\r\nthrough the roof of whose hut it had passed, and buried itself several\r\ninches in the floor, which was of consolidated earth.  Before it was\r\nbroken it must have weighed upwards of two pounds.\r\n\r\nM. Biot's summary of the evidence collected by him respecting the great\r\nshower of stones which fell at Aigle, in Normandy, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"On Tuesday, 26th April, 1803, about one o'clock, P.M., the weather\r\n    being serene, there was observed from Caen, Pont d'Audemer, and the\r\n    environs of Alencon, Falaise, and Verneuil, a fiery globe, of a very\r\n    brilliant splendour, and which moved in the atmosphere with great\r\n    rapidity.  Some moments after, there was heard at Aigle, and in the\r\n    environs of that town, in the extent of more than thirty leagues in\r\n    every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted five or six\r\n    minutes.  At first there were three or four reports like those of a\r\n    cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled the firing of\r\n    musketry; after which, there was heard a dreadful rumbling, like the\r\n    beating of a drum.  The air was calm and the sky serene, except a few\r\n    clouds, such as are frequently observed.  This noise proceeded from a\r\n    small cloud which had a rectangular form; the largest side being in a\r\n    direction from east to west.  It appeared motionless all the time\r\n    that the phenomenon lasted; but the vapours of which it was composed,\r\n    were projected momentarily from different sides, by the effect of\r\n    successive explosions.  This cloud was about half a league to the\r\n    north-north-west of the town of Aigle.  It was at a great elevation\r\n    in the atmosphere; for, the inhabitants of two hamlets, a league\r\n    distant from each other, saw it at the same time above their heads.\r\n    In the whole canton over which this cloud was suspended, there was a\r\n    hissing noise, like that of a stone discharged from a sling; and a\r\n    great many mineral masses, exactly similar to those distinguished by\r\n    the name of 'meteor-stones,' were seen to fall.  The district in\r\n    which these masses were projected, forms an elliptical extent of\r\n    about two leagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth,\r\n    the greatest dimension being in a direction from south-east to\r\n    north-west; forming a declination of about 22 degrees.  This\r\n    direction, which the meteor must have followed, is exactly that of\r\n    the magnetic meridian, which is a remarkable result.  The greatest of\r\n    these stones fell at the south-eastern extremity of the large axis of\r\n    the ellipse, the middle-sized in the centre, and the smaller at the\r\n    other extremity.  Hence it appears, that the largest fell first, as\r\n    might naturally be supposed.  The largest of all those that fell,\r\n    weighs seventeen pounds and a half.  The smallest which I have seen,\r\n    weighs about two _gros_, (a thousandth part of the last.)  The number\r\n    of all those which fell, is certainly above two or three thousand.\"\r\n\r\nMeteoric stones have been known to commit great injury in their fall.  In\r\nJuly, 1790, a very bright fire-ball, luminous as the sun, of the size of\r\nan ordinary balloon, appeared near Bourdeaux, which, after filling the\r\ninhabitants with alarm, burst, and disappeared.  A few days after, some\r\npeasants brought stones into the town, which they said had fallen from\r\nthe meteor; but, the philosophers to whom they offered them laughed at\r\ntheir statements.  One of these stones, fifteen inches in diameter, broke\r\nthrough the roof of a cottage, and killed a herdsman and a bullock.  In\r\n1810, a great stone fell at Shahabad, in India.  It burnt a village, and\r\nkilled several people.\r\n\r\nThe fall of meteoric stones is more frequent than would be supposed.\r\nChaldni has compiled a Catalogue of all recorded instances from the\r\nearliest times.  Of these, twenty-seven are previous to the Christian\r\nera; thirty-five from the beginning of the first to the end of the\r\nfourteenth century; eighty-nine from the beginning of the fifteenth to\r\nthe beginning of the present century; from which time, since the\r\nattention of scientific men has been directed to the subject, above sixty\r\ncases have been recorded.  These are, doubtless, but a small proportion\r\nof the whole amount of meteoric showers which have fallen, when the small\r\nextent of surface occupied by those capable of recording the event is\r\ncompared with the wide expanse of the ocean, the vast uninhabited\r\ndeserts, mountains, and forests, and the countries occupied by savage\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMeteoric stones have generally a broken, irregular surface, coated with a\r\nthin black crust, like varnish.  When broken, they appear to have been\r\nmade up of a number of small spherical bodies of a grey colour, imbedded\r\nin a gritty substance, and often interspersed with yellow spots.  A\r\nconsiderable proportion of iron is found in all of them, partly in a\r\nmalleable state, partly in that of an oxide, and always in combination\r\nwith a rather scarce metal called nickel; {181} the earths silica, and\r\nmagnesia, and sulphur, form the other chief ingredients; but, the earths\r\nalumina and lime, the metals manganese, chrome, and cobalt, together with\r\ncarbon, soda, and water, have also been found in small quantities, but\r\nnot in the same specimens.  No substance with which chemists were\r\npreviously unacquainted, has ever been found in them; but no combination,\r\nsimilar to that in meteoric stones, has ever been met with in geological\r\nformations, or among the products of any volcano.  They are sometimes\r\nvery friable, sometimes very hard; and some that are friable when they\r\nfirst fall, become hard afterwards.  When taken up soon after their fall\r\nthey are extremely hot.  They vary in weight from two drams to several\r\nhundred pounds.  Meteoric stones have fallen in all climates, in every\r\npart of the earth, at all seasons, in the night and in the day.\r\n\r\nThe meteoric stones already noticed, are not the only metallic bodies\r\nwhich are supposed to fall from the sky.  In many parts of the earth\r\nmasses of malleable iron, often of vast size, have been found.  An\r\nimmense mass seen by Pallas, in Siberia, was discovered at a great height\r\non a mountain of slate, near the river Jenesei.  The Tartars held it in\r\ngreat veneration, as having fallen from heaven.  It was removed in the\r\nyear 1749, to the town of Krasnojarsk, by the inspector of iron mines.\r\nThe mass, which weighed about 1,400 pounds, was irregular in form, and\r\ncellular, like a sponge.  The iron was tough and malleable, and was found\r\nto contain nickel, silica, magnesia, sulphur, and chrome.  Another\r\nenormous mass of meteoric iron was found in South America, about the year\r\n1788.  It lay in a vast plain, half sunk in the ground, and was supposed,\r\nfrom its size and the known weight of iron, to contain upwards of\r\nthirteen tons.  Specimens of this mass are now in the British Museum, and\r\nhave been found to contain 90 per cent. of iron and 10 of nickel.  Many\r\nother masses of iron might be mentioned, which, from the places in which\r\nthey are found, and from their composition, leave no doubt as to their\r\nbeing of meteoric origin.  The only instance, on record, of iron having\r\nbeen actually seen to fall from the atmosphere, is that which took place\r\nat Agram in Croatia, on the 26th May, 1751.  About six o'clock in the\r\nevening, the sky being quite clear, a ball of fire was seen, which shot\r\nalong, with a hollow noise, from west to east, and, after a loud\r\nexplosion accompanied by a great smoke, two masses of iron fell from it\r\nin the form of chains welded together.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to\r\naccount for the origin of these remarkable bodies.  Some have supposed\r\nthem to have been shot out from volcanoes belonging to our earth; but\r\nthis theory is opposed by the fact that no substance, resembling\r\naerolites, has ever been found in or near any volcano; and they fall from\r\na height to which no volcano can be supposed to have projected them, and\r\nstill less to have given them the horizontal direction in which they\r\nusually move.  Another supposition is, that these masses are formed in\r\nthe atmosphere; but it is almost ridiculous to imagine a body, weighing\r\nmany tons, to be produced by any chemical or electrical forces in the\r\nupper regions of the air.  A third explanation is, that they are bodies\r\nthrown out by the volcanoes, which are known to exist in the moon, with\r\nsuch force as to bring them within the sphere of the earth's attraction.\r\nThis notion was supported by the celebrated astronomer and mathematician\r\nLa Place.  He calculated that a body projected from the moon with the\r\nvelocity of 7771 feet in the first second, would reach our earth in about\r\ntwo days and a half.  But other astronomers are of opinion, that the\r\nknown velocity of some meteors is too great to admit of the possibility\r\nof their having come from the moon.  The theory which agrees best with\r\nknown facts and the laws of nature, is that proposed by Chladni, namely,\r\nthat the meteors are bodies moving in space, either masses of matter as\r\noriginally created, or fragments separated from a larger mass of a\r\nsimilar nature.  This view has also been supported by Sir Humphrey Davy,\r\nwho says, \"The luminous appearances of shooting-stars and meteors cannot\r\nbe owing to any inflammation of elastic fluids, but must depend upon the\r\nignition of solid bodies.  Dr. Halley calculated the height of a meteor\r\nat ninety miles; and the great American meteor, which threw down showers\r\nof stones, was estimated at seventeen miles high.  The velocity of motion\r\nof these bodies must, in all cases, be immensely great, and the heat\r\nproduced by the compression of the most rarefied air from the velocity of\r\nmotion, must be, probably, sufficient to ignite the mass; and all the\r\nphenomena may be explained, if _falling stars_ be supposed to be small\r\nbodies moving round the earth in very eccentric orbits, which become\r\nignited only when they pass with immense velocity through the upper\r\nregion of the atmosphere; and if the meteoric bodies which throw down\r\nstones with explosions, be supposed to be similar bodies which contain\r\neither combustible or elastic matter.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter ought not to be concluded without a short notice of that\r\nremarkable rain known to geologists as \"fossil rain.\"  In the new\r\nred-sandstone of the Storeton quarries, impressions of the foot-prints of\r\nancient animals have been discovered; and in examining some of the slabs\r\nof stone extracted at the depth of above thirty feet, Mr. Cunningham\r\nobserved \"that their under surface was thickly covered with minute\r\nhemispherical projections, or casts in relief of circular pits, in the\r\nimmediately subjacent layers of clay.  The origin of these marks, he is\r\nof opinion, must be ascribed to showers of rain which fell upon an\r\nargillaceous beach exposed by the retiring tide, and their preservation\r\nto the filling up of the indentations by sand.  On the same slabs are\r\nimpressions of the feet of small reptiles, which appear to have passed\r\nover the clay previously to the shower, since the foot-marks are also\r\nindented with circular pits, but to a less degree; and the difference Mr.\r\nCunningham explains by the pressure of the animal having rendered these\r\nportions less easily acted upon.\"  The preservation of these marks has\r\nbeen explained by supposing dry sand, drifted by the wind, to have swept\r\nover and filled up the footprints, rain-pits, and hollows of every kind,\r\nwhich the soft argillaceous surface had received.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece to the present chapter (p. 156), represents a slab of\r\nsandstone containing impressions of the foot of a bird and of rain drops.\r\nThis slab is from a sandstone basin near Turner's Falls, a fine cataract\r\nof the Connecticut river in the State of Massachusetts, and is described\r\nby Dr. Deane in a recent number of the American Journal of Science.  \"It\r\nis rare,\" says that gentleman, to \"find a stratum containing these\r\nfootprints exactly as they were made by the animal, without having\r\nsuffered change.  They are usually more or less disturbed or obliterated\r\nby the too soft nature of the mud, the coarseness of the materials, and\r\nby many other circumstances which we may easily see would deface them, so\r\nthat although the general form of the foot may be apparent, the minute\r\ntraces of its appendages are almost invariably lost.  In general, except\r\nin thick-toed species, we cannot discover the distinct evidences of the\r\nstructure of the toes, each toe appearing to be formed of a single joint,\r\nand seldom terminated by a claw.  But, a few specimens hitherto\r\ndiscovered at this locality completely developed the true characters of\r\nthe foot, its ranks of joints, its claws and integuments.  So far as I\r\nhave seen, the faultless impressions are upon shales of the finest\r\ntexture with a smooth glossy surface, such as would retain the beautiful\r\nimpressions of rain drops.  This kind of surface containing footmarks is\r\nexceedingly rare: I have seen but few detached examples; recently it has\r\nbeen my good fortune to recover a stratum, containing in all more than\r\none hundred most beautiful impressions of the feet of four or five\r\nvarieties of birds, the entire surface being also pitted by a shower of\r\nfossil rain-drops.  The slabs are perfectly smooth on the inferior\r\nsurface, and are about two inches in thickness.\r\n\r\n\"The impression of a medallion is not more sharp and clear than are most\r\nof these imprints, and it may be proper to observe, that this remarkable\r\npreservation may be ascribed to the circumstance, that the entire surface\r\nof the stratum was incrusted with a layer of micaceous sandstone,\r\nadhering so firmly that it would not cleave off, thereby requiring the\r\nlaborious and skilful application of the chisel.  The appearance of this\r\nshining layer which is of a gray colour, while the fossil slab is a dark\r\nred, seems to carry the probability that it was washed or blown over the\r\nlatter while in a state of loose sand, thus filling up the foot-prints\r\nand rain-drops, and preserving them unchanged until the present\r\nday--unchanged in the smallest particular, so far as relates merely to\r\nconfiguration, nothing being obliterated; the precise form of the nails,\r\nor claws, and joints, and in the deep impressions of the heel bone, being\r\nexquisitely preserved.\"\r\n\r\nThe small slab figured at p. 156 is described as being an incomparable\r\nspecimen.  \"For purity of impression it is unsurpassed, and the living\r\nreality of the rain-drops, the beautiful colour of the stone, its sound\r\ntexture and lightness, renders it a fit member for any collection of\r\norganic remains.\"\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Mandan rain-makers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON SAYINGS RESPECTING THE WEATHER--SAINT SWITHIN'S-DAY--SIGNS OF RAIN\r\nOR OF FAIR WEATHER DERIVED FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN--FROM THAT OF\r\nTHE MOON--FROM THE STARS--FROM THE SKY--FROM THE DISTINCTNESS OF\r\nSOUNDS--FROM THE RISING OF SMOKE--FROM THE PECULIAR ACTIONS OF PLANTS AND\r\nANIMALS--PROGNOSTICS NOTICED BY SIR HUMPHREY DAVY--SIGNS OF RAIN\r\nCOLLECTED BY DR.

Some of these\r\nprognostics are of a general character applying to all seasons, and there\r\nare others which apply only to a particular season; but they may all be\r\nderived from appearances of the heavenly bodies and of the sky, the state\r\nof meteorological instruments, and the notions and habits of certain\r\nplants and animals.  The author of the \"Journal of a Naturalist\" has some\r\ngood observations on this subject.  He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Old simplicities, tokens of winds and weather, and the plain\r\n    observances of human life, are everywhere waning fast to decay.  Some\r\n    of them may have been fond conceits; but they accorded with the\r\n    ordinary manners of the common people, and marked times, seasons, and\r\n    things, with sufficient truth for those who had faith in them.\r\n    Little as we retain of these obsolete fancies, we have not quite\r\n    abandoned them all; and there are yet found among our peasants a few,\r\n    who mark the blooming of the large water-lily (_lilium candidum_),\r\n    and think that the number of its blossoms on a stem will indicate the\r\n    price of wheat by the bushel for the ensuing year, each blossom\r\n    equivalent to a shilling.  We expect a sunny day too, when the\r\n    pimpernel (_anagallis arvensis_) fully expands its blossoms; a\r\n    dubious, or a moist one, when they are closed.  In this belief,\r\n    however, we have the sanction of some antiquity to support us.  Sir\r\n    F. Bacon records it; Gerarde notes it as a common opinion entertained\r\n    by country people above two centuries ago; and I must not withhold my\r\n    own faith in its veracity, but say that I believe this pretty little\r\n    flower to afford more certain indication of dryness or moisture in\r\n    the air than any of our hygrometers do.  But if these be fallible\r\n    criterions, we will notice another that seldom deceives us.  The\r\n    approach of a sleety snow-storm, following a deceitful gleam in\r\n    spring, is always announced to us by the loud untuneful voice of the\r\n    missel-thrush (_turdus viscivorus_) as it takes its stand on some\r\n    tall tree, like an enchanter calling up the gale.  It seems to have\r\n    no song, no voice, but this harsh predictive note; and it in great\r\n    measure ceases with the storms of spring.  We hear it occasionally in\r\n    autumn, but its voice is not then prognostic of any change of\r\n    weather.  The missel-thrush is a wild and wary bird, keeping\r\n    generally in open fields and commons, heaths and unfrequented places,\r\n    feeding upon worms and insects.  In severe weather it approaches our\r\n    plantations and shrubberies, to feed on the berry of the mistletoe,\r\n    the ivy, or the scarlet fruit of the holly or the yew; and, should\r\n    the redwing or the fieldfare presume to partake of these with it, we\r\n    are sure to hear its voice in clattering and contention with the\r\n    intruders, until it drives them from the place, though it watches and\r\n    attends, notwithstanding, to its own safety.\"\r\n\r\nBut before we notice more in detail the natural prognostics of the\r\nweather, it is desirable to speak of a superstition which is widely\r\nspread among all classes, in the town as well as in the country.  The\r\nsuperstition referred to, is that connected with St. Swithin's-day, and\r\nis well expressed in a Scotch proverb:--\r\n\r\n   \"Saint Swithin's-day, gif ye do rain,\r\n   For forty days it will remain;\r\n   Saint Swithin's-day, an ye be fair,\r\n   For forty days 'twill rain nae mair.\"\r\n\r\nThis superstition originated with Swithin, or Swithum, bishop of\r\nWinchester, who died in the year 868.  He desired that he might be buried\r\nin the open churchyard, \"where the drops of rain might wet his grave;\"\r\n\"thinking,\" says Bishop Hall, \"that no vault was so good to cover his\r\ngrave as that of heaven.\"  But when Swithin was canonized the monks\r\nresolved to remove his body into the choir of the church.  According to\r\ntradition, this was to have been done on the 15th of July; but it rained\r\nso violently for forty days that the design was abandoned.  Mr. Howard\r\nremarks, that the tradition is so far valuable, as it proves that the\r\nsummers in the southern part of our island were subject, a thousand years\r\nago, to occasional heavy rains, in the same way as at present.  This\r\naccurate observer has endeavoured to ascertain how far the popular notion\r\nis borne out by the fact.  In 1807 and 1808, it rained on St.\r\nSwithin's-day, and a dry season followed.  In 1818 and 1819, it was dry\r\non the 15th, and a very dry season followed.  The other summers,\r\noccurring between 1807 and 1819, seem to show, \"that in a majority of our\r\nsummers, a showery period which, with some latitude as to time and local\r\ncircumstances, may be admitted to constitute daily rain for forty days,\r\ndoes come on about the time indicated by the tradition of St. Swithin.\"\r\n\r\nBut in these calculations, it is necessary to bear in mind that the\r\nchange of style has very much interfered with St. Swithin.  With the day\r\nallowed in the closing year of the last century, St. Swithin's day is how\r\nthirteen days earlier in the calendar than it would have been by the old\r\nstyle.  Thus the true St. Swithin's-day, according to the tradition, is\r\nabout the 28th of July, and not the 15th, as set down in the present\r\ncalendar.  There must, therefore, be a considerable difference as to the\r\nrains and this day.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to collect a number of prognostics connected with the\r\nappearances of the heavenly bodies and of the sky; they are the result of\r\nlong experience, but at the same time it is necessary to caution our\r\nreaders against attaching much importance to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rises red, wind and rain may be expected during the day; but\r\nwhen he rises unclouded, attended by a scorching heat, cloudiness and\r\nperhaps rain will ensue before mid-day.  When he rises clouded, with a\r\nfew grey clouds, they will soon dissipate, and a fine day will follow.\r\nWhen his light is dim, vapour exists in the upper regions of the air, and\r\nmay be expected to descend shortly after in the form of dense clouds.\r\nWhen his light, after rain, is of a transparent watery hue, rain will\r\nsoon fall again.  When his direct rays have a scorching and weakening\r\neffect on the body throughout the greater part of the day, the next day\r\nwill be cloudy, and perhaps rainy.  When the sun is more or less obscured\r\nby a thicker or thinner cirro-stratus cloud, and when he is said to be\r\n_wading_ in the cloud, rain may come--if the cloud indicates rain it will\r\ncome.  A halo surrounding the disc of the sun is almost always sure to\r\nprecede rain.  A red sunset without clouds indicates a doubt of fair\r\nweather; but a fine day may be expected after a red sunset in clouds.  A\r\nwatery sunset, diverging rays of light, either direct from the sun or\r\nfrom behind a cloud, is indicative of rain.  After a dull black sunset\r\nrain may be expected.\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying among country people,--\r\n\r\n   \"An evening red, or a morning grey,\r\n   Doth betoken a bonnie day;\r\n   In an evening grey and a morning red,\r\n   Put on your hat, or yell weet your head.\"\r\n\r\nThere are not many prognostics connected with the appearances of the\r\nmoon.  The changes of the moon produce greater effects than at any other\r\nperiod.  With a clear silvery aspect fair weather may be expected.  A\r\npale moon always indicates rain, and a red one wind.  Seeing the \"old\r\nmoon in the new one's arms,\" is a sign of stormy weather.  Seeing the new\r\nmoon very young, \"like the paring of a nail,\" also indicates wet; but\r\nwhen the horns of the new moon are blunt, they indicate rain, and fair\r\nweather when sharp.  It is truly said:\r\n\r\n   \"In the wane of the moon,\r\n   A cloudy morning bodes a fair afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd also\r\n\r\n   'New moon's mist\r\n   Never dies of thirst.'\r\n\r\nHalos and coronae are oftener seen about the moon than the sun, and they\r\nindicate rain.\r\n\r\nThe stars appearing dim indicate rain.  Very few stars seen at one time,\r\nwhen there is no frost, indicate a similar result.\r\n\r\nWhen the sky is of deeply-coloured blue, it indicates rain.  If distant\r\nobjects appear very distinct and near through the air, it indicates rain.\r\nWhen the air feels oppressive to walk in, rain will follow; when it feels\r\nlight and pleasant, fair weather will continue.\r\n\r\nWhen distant sounds are distinctly heard through the air in a calm day,\r\nsuch as the tolling of bells, barking of dogs, talking of people,\r\nwaterfalls, or rapids over mill-dams, the air is loaded with vapour, and\r\nrain may be expected.  The sea is often heard to roar, and loudest at\r\nnight, as also the noise of a city, when a cloud is seen suspended a very\r\nshort way above head.\r\n\r\nIf smoke rise perpendicularly upwards from chimneys in calm weather, fair\r\nweather may be expected to continue; but if it fall toward and roll along\r\nthe ground, not being easily dispersed, rain will ensue.\r\n\r\nMany of the above prognostics, as well as some of those relating to\r\nanimals, are thus noticed by Sir Humphrey Davy, in his \"Salmonia, or Days\r\nof Fly-fishing.\"  The conversation is between Halieus, a fly-fisher;\r\nPoietes, a poet; Physicus, a man of science; and Ornither, a sportsman.\r\n\r\n    \"_Poiet_.  I hope we shall have another good day to-morrow, for the\r\n    clouds are red in the west.\r\n\r\n    _Phys_.  I have no doubt of it; for the red has a tint of purple.\r\n\r\n    _Hal_.  Do you know why this tint portends fine weather?\r\n\r\n    _Phys_.  The air, when dry, I believe, refracts more red or heating\r\n    rays; and as dry air is not perfectly transparent, they are again\r\n    reflected in the horizon.  I have generally observed a coppery or\r\n    yellow sun-set to foretell rain; but, as an indication of wet weather\r\n    approaching, nothing is more certain than a halo round the moon,\r\n    which is produced by the precipitated water; and the larger the\r\n    circle, the nearer the clouds, and consequently the more ready to\r\n    fall.\r\n\r\n    _Hal_.  I have often observed that the old proverb is correct--\r\n\r\n    'A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd's warning;\r\n    A rainbow at night is the shepherd's delight'\r\n\r\n    Can you explain this omen?\r\n\r\n    _Phys_.  A rainbow can only occur when the clouds containing or\r\n    depositing the rain are opposite the sun,--and in the evening the\r\n    rainbow is in the east, and in the morning in the west.  As,\r\n    therefore, our heavy rains in this climate are usually brought by the\r\n    westerly wind, a rainbow in the west indicates that the bad weather\r\n    is on the road, by the wind, to us; whereas, the rainbow in the east\r\n    proves that the rain in these clouds is passing from us.\r\n\r\n    _Poiet_.  I have often observed that when the swallows fly high, fine\r\n    weather is to be expected or continued; but when they fly low, and\r\n    close to the ground, rain is almost surely approaching.  Can you\r\n    account for this?\r\n\r\n    _Hal_.  Swallows follow the flies and gnats, and flies and gnats\r\n    usually delight in warm strata of air; and as warm air is lighter,\r\n    and usually moister than cold air, when the warm strata of air are\r\n    high, there is less chance of moisture being thrown down from them by\r\n    the mixture with cold air; but when the warm and moist air is close\r\n    to the surface, it is almost certain that, as the cold air flows down\r\n    into it, a deposition of water will take place.\r\n\r\n    _Poiet_.  I have often seen sea-gulls assemble on the land, and have\r\n    almost always observed that very stormy and rainy weather was\r\n    approaching.  I conclude that these animals, sensible of a current of\r\n    air approaching from the ocean, retire to the land to shelter\r\n    themselves from the storm.\r\n\r\n    _Orn_.  No such thing.  The storm is their element, and the little\r\n    petrel enjoys the heaviest gale; because, living on the smaller\r\n    sea-insects, he is sure to find his food in the spray of a heavy\r\n    wave; and you may see him flitting above the edge of the highest\r\n    surge.  I believe that the reason of this migration of sea-gulls, and\r\n    other sea-birds, to the land, is their security of finding food; and\r\n    they may be observed, at this time, feeding greedily on the\r\n    earth-worms and larvae driven out of the ground by severe floods; and\r\n    the fish on which they prey in fine weather in the sea, leave the\r\n    surface, and go deeper in storms.  The search after food, as we have\r\n    agreed on a former occasion, is the principal cause why animals\r\n    change their places.  The different tribes of the wading birds always\r\n    migrate when rain is about to take place; and I remember once, in\r\n    Italy, having been long waiting, in the end of March, for the arrival\r\n    of the double snipe in the Campagna of Rome, a great flight appeared\r\n    on the 3rd of April, and the day after heavy rain set in, which\r\n    greatly interfered with my sport.  The vulture, upon the same\r\n    principle, follows armies; and I have no doubt that the augury of the\r\n    ancients was a good deal founded upon the observation of the\r\n    instincts of birds.  There are many superstitions of the vulgar owing\r\n    to the same source.  For anglers, in spring, it is always unlucky to\r\n    see single magpies,--but _two_ may always be regarded as a favourable\r\n    omen; and the reason is, that in cold and stormy weather one magpie\r\n    alone leaves the nest in search of food, the other remaining sitting\r\n    upon the eggs or the young ones; but when two go out together, it is\r\n    only when the weather is warm and mild, and favourable for fishing.\r\n\r\n    _Poiet_.  The singular connexions of causes and effects to which you\r\n    have just referred, makes superstition less to be wondered at,\r\n    particularly amongst the vulgar; and when two facts, naturally\r\n    unconnected, have been accidentally coincident, it is not singular\r\n    that this coincidence should have been observed and registered, and\r\n    that omens of the most absurd kind should be trusted in.  In the west\r\n    of England, half a century ago, a particular hollow noise on the\r\n    sea-coast was referred to a spirit or goblin, called Bucca, and was\r\n    supposed to foretell a shipwreck.  The philosopher knows that sound\r\n    travels much faster than currents in the air; and the sound always\r\n    foretold the approach of a very heavy storm, which seldom takes place\r\n    on that wild and rocky coast without a shipwreck on some part of its\r\n    extensive shores, surrounded by the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner has collected in the following amusing lines a large number of\r\nthe natural prognostics of rain.  They are said to have been addressed to\r\na lady, who asked the Doctor if he thought it would rain to-morrow.\r\n\r\n   \"The hollow winds begin to blow,\r\n   The clouds look black, the glass is low;\r\n   The soot falls down, the spaniels sleep,\r\n   And spiders from their cobwebs peep:\r\n   Last night the sun went pale to bed,\r\n   The moon in halos hid her head:\r\n   The boding shepherd heaves a sigh,\r\n   For, see! a rainbow spans the sky:\r\n   The walls are damp, the ditches smell,\r\n   Closed is the pink-eyed pimpernel;\r\n   Hark! how the chairs and tables crack;\r\n   Old Betty's joints are on the rack;\r\n   Loud quack the ducks, the peacocks cry,\r\n   The distant hills are seeming nigh.\r\n   How restless are the snorting swine,--\r\n   The busy flies disturb the kine.\r\n   Low o'er the grass the swallow wings;\r\n   The cricket, too, how loud it sings:\r\n   Puss on the hearth with velvet paws,\r\n   Sits smoothing o'er her whisker'd jaws.\r\n   Through the clear stream the fishes rise,\r\n   And nimbly catch the incautious flies:\r\n   The sheep were seen at early light\r\n   Cropping the meads with eager bite.\r\n   Though June, the air is cold and chill;\r\n   The mellow blackbird's voice is still.\r\n   The glow-worms, numerous and bright,\r\n   Illum'd the dewy dell last night.\r\n   At dusk the squalid toad was seen,\r\n   Hopping, and crawling o'er the green.\r\n   The frog has lost his yellow vest,\r\n   And in a dingy suit is dressed.\r\n   The leech, disturb'd, is newly risen,\r\n   Quite to the summit of his prison.\r\n   The whirling winds the dust obeys,\r\n   And in the rapid eddy plays;\r\n   My dog, so alter'd in his taste,\r\n   Quits mutton-bones on grass to feast;\r\n   And see yon rooks, how odd their flight!\r\n   They imitate the gliding kite,\r\n   Or seem precipitate to fall,\r\n   As if they felt the piercing ball:--\r\n   'Twill surely rain,--I see with sorrow,\r\n   Our jaunt must be put off to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nUncivilized nations often entertain the absurd notion that certain\r\nindividuals can command the rain whenever they please.  Much honour is\r\nshown to persons supposed to possess this power, for they are considered\r\nas having some mysterious intercourse with heaven.  Catlin gives a\r\nstriking instance of this superstition as it exists among the Mandans of\r\nNorth America.  These people raise a great deal of corn; but their\r\nharvests are sometimes destroyed by long-continued drought.  When\r\nthreatened with this calamity, the women (who have the care of the\r\npatches of corn) implore their lords to intercede for rain; and\r\naccordingly the chiefs and doctors assemble to deliberate on the case.\r\nWhen they have decided that it is necessary to produce rain, they wisely\r\ndelay the matter for as many days as possible; and it is not until\r\nfurther urged by the complaints and entreaties of the women, that they\r\nbegin to take the usual steps for accomplishing their purpose.  At length\r\nthey assemble in the council-house with all their apparatus about\r\nthem--with abundance of wild sage and aromatic herbs, to burn before the\r\n\"Great Spirit.\"  On these occasions the lodge is closed to all except the\r\ndoctors and some ten or fifteen young men, the latter being the persons\r\nto whom the honour of making it rain, or the disgrace of having failed in\r\nthe attempt, is to belong.\r\n\r\nAfter having witnessed the conjurations of the doctors inside the lodge,\r\nthese young men are called up by lot, one at a time, to spend a day on\r\nthe top of the lodge, and to see how far their efforts will avail in\r\nproducing rain; at the same time the smoke of the burning herbs ascends\r\nthrough a hole in the roof.  On one of these occasions, when all the\r\ncharms were in operation, and when three young men had spent each his day\r\non the lodge in ineffectual efforts to bring rain, and the fourth was\r\nengaged alternately addressing the crowd of villagers and the spirits of\r\nthe air, but in vain, it so happened that the steam-boat \"Yellow Stone,\"\r\nmade her first trip up the Missouri river, and about noon approached the\r\nvillage of the Mandans.  Catlin was a passenger on this boat; and helped\r\nto fire a salute of twenty guns of twelve pounds calibre, when they first\r\ncame in sight of the village, which was at some three or four miles\r\ndistance.  These guns introduced a new sound into the country, which the\r\nMandans naturally enough supposed to be thunder.  \"The young man upon the\r\nlodge, who turned it to good account, was gathering fame in rounds of\r\napplause, which were repeated and echoed through the whole village; all\r\neyes were centred upon him--chiefs envied him--mothers' hearts were\r\nbeating high, whilst they were decorating and leading up their fair\r\ndaughters to offer him in marriage on his signal success.  The\r\nmedicine-men had left the lodge, and came out to bestow upon him the\r\nenvied title of 'medicine-man,' or 'doctor,' which he had so deservedly\r\nwon--wreaths were prepared to decorate his brows, and eagle's plumes and\r\ncalumets were in readiness for him--his enemies wore on their faces a\r\nsilent gloom and hatred; and his old sweethearts who had cast him off,\r\ngazed intensely upon him, as they glowed with the burning fever of\r\nrepentance.  During all this excitement, Wak-a-dah-ha-hee (or the white\r\nbuffalo's hair) kept his position, assuming the most commanding and\r\nthreatening attitudes; brandishing his shield in the direction of the\r\nthunder, although there was not a cloud to be seen, until he (poor\r\nfellow) being elevated above the rest of the village, espied, to his\r\ninexpressible amazement, the steamboat ploughing its way up the windings\r\nof the river below, puffing her steam from her pipes, and sending forth\r\nthe thunder from a twelve-pounder on her deck.  'The white Buffalo's\r\nhair' stood motionless, and turned pale; he looked awhile, and turned to\r\nthe chief and to the multitude, and addressed them with a trembling\r\nlip--'My friends, we will get no rain!--there are, you see, no clouds;\r\nbut my medicine is great--I have brought a _thunder-boat_! look and see\r\nit! the thunder you hear is out of her mouth, and the lightning which you\r\nsee is on the waters!'\r\n\r\n\"At this intelligence, the whole village flew to the tops of their\r\nwigwams, or to the bank of the river, from whence the steamer was in full\r\nview, and ploughing along to their utter dismay and confusion.  In this\r\npromiscuous throng, chiefs, doctors, women, children, and dogs, were\r\nmingled, Wak-a-dah-ha-hee having descended from his high place to mingle\r\nwith the frightened throng.  Dismayed at the approach of so strange and\r\nunaccountable an object, the Mandans stood their ground but a few\r\nmoments; when, by an order of the chiefs, all hands were ensconced within\r\nthe piquets of their village, and all the warriors armed for desperate\r\nself-defence.  A few moments brought the boat in front of the village,\r\nand all was still and quiet as death; not a Mandan was to be seen upon\r\nthe banks.  The steamer was moored, and three or four of the chiefs soon\r\nafter walked boldly down the bank, and on to her deck, with a spear in\r\none hand, and a calumet, or pipe of peace in the other.  The moment they\r\nstepped on board, they met (to their great surprise and joy) their old\r\nfriend Major Sanford, their agent, which circumstance put an instant end\r\nto all their fears.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long, however, before the rain-maker could be persuaded to come\r\nforward, or to listen to the assurance that his medicine had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the arrival of the ship.  Unwilling to lose the fame\r\nof having produced such a phenomenon, he continued to assert that he knew\r\nof its coming, and by his magic had caused it to approach.  But he was\r\nlittle regarded in the universal bustle and gossip which was going on\r\nrespecting the mysteries of the \"thunder-boat.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the day passed on, and towards evening a cloud began to rise\r\nabove the horizon.  Wak-a-dah-ha-hee no sooner observed this, than, with\r\nshield on his arm and bow in hand, he was again upon the lodge.\r\n\"Stiffened and braced to the last sinew, he stood with his face and his\r\nshield presented to the cloud, and his bow drawn.  He drew the eyes of\r\nthe whole village upon him, as he vaunted forth his superhuman powers;\r\nand at the same time commanded the cloud to come nearer, that he might\r\ndraw down its contents upon their heads and the corn-fields of the\r\nMandans.  In this wise he stood, waving his shield over his head,\r\nstamping his foot, and frowning as he drew his bow and threatened the\r\nheavens, commanding it to rain--his bow was bent, and the arrow drawn to\r\nits head, was sent to the cloud, {210} and he exclaimed, 'My friends, it\r\nis done!  Wak-a-dah-ha-hee's arrow has entered that black cloud, and the\r\nMandans will be wet with the water of the skies!'  His predictions were\r\ntrue--in a few moments the cloud was over the village, and the rain fell\r\nin torrents.  He stood for some time wielding his weapons, and boasting\r\nof the efficacy of his _medicine_ to those who had been about him, but\r\nwere now driven to the shelter of their wigwams; and descended from his\r\nhigh place (in which he had been perfectly drenched) prepared to receive\r\nthe honours and homage that were due to one so potent in his mysteries;\r\nand to receive the style and title of _medicine-man_.\"  Catlin further\r\ninforms us, that when the Mandans undertake to make it rain, they always\r\nsucceed, for their ceremonies never stop until rain begins to fall: and\r\nalso, that he who has once made it rain never attempts it again; his\r\nmedicine is undoubted--and on future occasions of the kind he stands\r\naloof, giving an opportunity to other young men who are ambitious to\r\nsignalize themselves in the same way.\r\n\r\nA superstition similar to that of the Mandans prevails also among the\r\nCaffers of Southern Africa, and among the natives of Ceylon.  The Caffer\r\nchiefs, attended by their warriors, proceed with much ceremony, and laden\r\nwith presents, to the dwelling of the rain-doctor, where a grand feast is\r\nheld while certain charms are in process.  The impostor at length\r\ndismisses his guests with a variety of instructions, on the due\r\nobservance of which the success of their application is to depend.  These\r\ninstructions are generally of the most trifling kind: they are to travel\r\nhome in perfect silence; or they are not to look back; or they are to\r\ncompel every one they meet to turn back and go home with them.  Should\r\nrain happen to fall, the credit is given to the rain-doctor; but should\r\nthe drought continue, the fault is laid upon the failure of the\r\napplicants to fulfil these instructions with sufficient exactness.\r\n\r\nMajor Forbes gives an account of an old rain-doctor in Ceylon, who had\r\nplied a lucrative trade for many years, and at length wished to retire\r\nfrom business.  But the people were highly incensed at the idea of losing\r\nhis services, especially as a most distressing drought was at that time\r\nthe scourge of the land.  So persuaded were they of his powers, that they\r\nall agreed, that when required to do so by a whole village, he should be\r\ncompelled to furnish rain in sufficient quantities; and that if he was\r\ninsensible to rewards, he should be tormented with thorns or beaten into\r\ncompliance.  In vain did the poor old impostor at length declare the\r\ntruth, and assure the people that he had no power whatever to make it\r\nrain.  They treated his words with disdain, and dragged their victim from\r\nvillage to village, inflicting stripes at every halt.  Even the chief of\r\nthe district had determined on having rain by force, if fair means should\r\nfail, and ordered the rain-doctor to be taken to the village where rain\r\nwas most required.  On his way thither he was so fortunate as to meet\r\nwith Major Forbes, who took him under his protection, and probably saved\r\nhis life, though not without some difficulty, for it so happened that a\r\nfew slight showers fell near his own village, while all the rest of the\r\nneighbourhood was suffering the extremity of drought.\r\n\r\nMelancholy indeed is the condition of these poor people; in utter\r\nignorance of the source of all the providential mercies bestowed upon\r\nthem, and, therefore, made the dupes and credulous followers of knaves\r\nand impostors of every kind!\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, the missionaries have happily succeeded in\r\nopening the eyes of the deluded people to the cheat which is practised on\r\nthem.  One of the most intelligent of the Caffers of Southern Africa,\r\nhaving been led to suspect the integrity of the rain-maker, visited Mr.\r\nShaw, and told him of his determination to have the question set at rest,\r\nwhether or no the rain-maker could produce rain.  He had summoned the\r\nrain-maker to meet Mr. Shaw in an open plain, when all the Caffers of the\r\nsurrounding kraals were to be present to decide the affair.  Accordingly,\r\nat the appointed time and place, thousands of Caffers from the\r\nneighbouring country assembled in their war-dresses.  Mr. Shaw, being\r\nconfronted with a celebrated rain-maker, declared publicly that God alone\r\ngave rain; and then offered to present the rain-maker with a team of oxen\r\nif he should succeed in making it rain within a certain specified time.\r\nThis was agreed to; the rain-maker began his ceremonies, which are said\r\nto have been well calculated to impose upon an ignorant and superstitious\r\npeople.  The time having expired without any signs of rain, the chief who\r\nhad called together the meeting asked the rain-maker why he had so long\r\nimposed upon them?  The rain-maker complained that he had not been paid\r\nwell enough for his rain; and appealed to all present, whether rain had\r\nnot always been produced when he had been properly paid.  Mr. Shaw then\r\npointed out some half-famished cattle belonging to the rain-maker, which\r\nwere seen on a neighbouring hill starving for want of pasturage, and\r\nremarked, that if he really possessed his boasted skill, he would not\r\nhave neglected his own interests.  To this the rain-maker cleverly\r\nreplied, \"I never found a difficulty in making rain until _he_ (pointing\r\nto Mr. Shaw) came among us; but now, no sooner do I collect the clouds,\r\nand the rain is about to fall, than immediately there begins a sound of\r\n_ting_, _ting_, _ting_, (alluding to the chapel-bell,) which puts the\r\nclouds to flight, and prevents the rain from descending on your land.\"\r\nMr. Shaw was not able to tell what effect this ingenious excuse had upon\r\nthe majority of the Caffers, but he had the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nthe intelligent chief, who consulted him on the subject, never _bought_\r\nany more rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready Published in this Series.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE SNOW STORM.\r\nII.--THE FROZEN STREAM.\r\nIII.--THE RAIN CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly will be Published.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--THE DEW DROP.\r\nV.--THE THUNDER STORM.\r\nVI.--THE TEMPEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{18}  Physico-Theology by the Rev.
