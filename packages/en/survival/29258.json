When it began, the\r\narable fields of a community lay divided in a multitude of strips\r\nseparated from each other only by borders of unplowed turf. Each\r\nlandholder was in possession of a number of these strips, widely\r\nseparated from each other, and scattered all over the open fields, so\r\nthat he had a share in each of the various grades of land.[1] But his\r\nprivate use of the land was restricted to the period when it was being\r\nprepared for crop or was under crop. After harvest the land was grazed\r\nin common by the village flocks; and each year a half or a third of\r\nthe land was not plowed at all, but lay fallow and formed part of the\r\ncommon pasture. Under this system there was no opportunity for\r\nindividual initiative in varying the rotation of crops or the dates of\r\nplowing and seed time; the use of the land in common for a part of the\r\ntime restricted its use even during the time when it was not in\r\ncommon. The process by which this system was replaced by modern\r\nprivate ownership with unrestricted individual use is called the\r\nenclosure movement, because it involved the rearrangement of holdings\r\ninto separate, compact plots, divided from each other by enclosing\r\nhedges and ditches. The most notable feature of this process is the\r\nconversion of the open fields into sheep pasture. This involved the\r\neviction of the tenants who had been engaged in cultivating these\r\nfields and the amalgamation of many holdings of arable to form a few\r\nlarge enclosures for sheep. The enclosure movement was not merely the\r\ndisplacement of one system of tillage by another system of tillage; it\r\ninvolved the temporary displacement of tillage itself in favor of\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\nIn this monograph two things are undertaken: first, an analysis of the\r\nusually accepted version of the enclosure movement in the light of\r\ncontemporary evidence; and, secondly, the presentation of another\r\naccount of the nature and causes of the movement, consistent with\r\nitself and with the available evidence. The popular account of the\r\nenclosure movement turns upon a supposed advance in the price of wool,\r\ndue to the expansion of the woollen industry in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. Landlords at this period (we are told) were\r\nincreasingly eager for pecuniary gain and, because of the greater\r\nprofit to be made from grazing, were willing to evict the tenants on\r\ntheir land and convert the arable fields to sheep pasture. About the\r\nend of the sixteenth century, it is said, this first enclosure\r\nmovement came to an end, for there are evidences of the reconversion\r\nof pastures formerly laid to grass. An inquiry into the evidence shows\r\nthat the price of wool fell during the fifteenth century and failed to\r\nrise as rapidly as that of wheat during the sixteenth century.\r\nMoreover, the conversion of arable land to pasture did not cease when\r\nthe contrary process set in, but continued throughout the seventeenth\r\ncentury with apparently unabated vigor. These facts make it impossible\r\nto accept the current theory of the enclosure movement. There is, on\r\nthe other hand, abundant evidence that the fertility of much of the\r\ncommon-field land had been exhausted by centuries of cultivation. Some\r\nof it was allowed to run to waste; some was laid to grass, enclosed,\r\nand used as pasture. Productivity was gradually restored after some\r\nyears of rest, and it became possible to resume cultivation. The\r\nenclosure movement is explained not by a change in the price of wool,\r\nbut by the gradual loss of productivity of common-field land.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is not made here for the first time. It is advanced\r\nin Denton's _England in the Fifteenth Century_[2] and Gardiner, in\r\nhis _Student's History of England_,[3] accepts it. Prothero[4] and\r\nGonner[5] give it some place in their works. Dr. Simkhovitch, at whose\r\nsuggestion this inquiry was undertaken, has for some time been of the\r\nopinion that deterioration of the soil was the fundamental cause of\r\nthe displacement of arable farming by grazing.[6] This explanation,\r\nhowever, stands at the present time as an unverified hypothesis, which\r\nhas been specifically rejected by Gibbins, in his widely used\r\ntext-book,[7] and by Hasbach,[8] who objects that Denton does not\r\nprove his case. In this respect the theory is no more to be criticised\r\nthan the theory which these authorities accept, for that does not rest\r\nupon proof, but upon the prestige gained through frequent repetition.\r\nBut the matter need not rest here. It is unnecessary to accept any\r\nhypothetical account of events which are, after all, comparatively\r\nrecent, and for which the evidence is available.\r\n\r\nOf the various sources accessible for the study of the English\r\nenclosure movement, one type only has been extensively used by\r\nhistorians. The whole story of this movement as it is usually told is\r\nbased upon tracts, sermons, verses, proclamations, etc. of the\r\nsixteenth century--upon the literature of protest called forth by the\r\nsocial distress caused by enclosure. Until very recently the similar\r\nliterature of the seventeenth century has been neglected, although it\r\ndestroys the basis of assumptions which are fundamental to the\r\northodox account of the movement. Much of significance even in the\r\nliterature of the sixteenth century has been passed over--notably\r\ncertain striking passages in statutes of the latter half of the\r\ncentury, and in books on husbandry of the first half. Details of\r\nmanorial history derived from the account rolls of the manors\r\nthemselves, and contemporary manorial maps and surveys, as well as the\r\nrecords of the actual market prices of grain and wool, have been\r\nignored in the construction of an hypothetical account of the movement\r\nwhich breaks down whenever verification by contemporary evidence is\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is in many respects imperfect. It would be of great\r\nvalue, for instance, to have access to records of grain production\r\nover an area extensive enough, and for a long enough period, to\r\nfurnish reliable statistical indications of the trend of productivity.\r\nIt would be helpful to have exact information about the amount of land\r\nconverted from arable to pasture in each decade of the period under\r\nconsideration, and to know to what extent and at what dates land was\r\nreconverted to tillage after having been laid to grass. There are no\r\nrecords to supply most of this information. It is possible that the\r\nmaterials for a statistical study of soil productivity are in\r\nexistence, but up to the present time they have not been published,\r\nand it is doubtful if this deficiency will be supplied. It is even\r\nmore doubtful whether more can be learned about the rate of conversion\r\nof arable land to pasture than is now known, and this is little.\r\nProfessor Gay has made a careful study of the evidence on this\r\nquestion, and has analysed the reports of the government commissions\r\nfor enforcing the husbandry statutes before 1600,[9] and Miss Leonard\r\nhas made the returns of the commission of 1630 for Leicestershire\r\navailable.[10] The conditions under which these commissions worked\r\nmake the returns somewhat unreliable even for the years covered by\r\ntheir reports, and much interpolation is necessary, as there are\r\nserious gaps in the series of years for which returns are made. For\r\ndates outside of the period 1485-1630 we must rely entirely on\r\nliterary references. Unsatisfactory as our statistical information is\r\non this important question, it is far more complete than the evidence\r\non the subject of the reconversion to tillage of arable land which had\r\nbeen turned into pasture.\r\n\r\nIt is to the unfortunate social consequences of enclosure that we owe\r\nthe abundance of historical material on this subject. Undoubtedly much\r\nland was converted to pasture in a piece-meal fashion, as small\r\nholders saw the possibility of making the change quietly, and without\r\ndisturbing the rest of the community. If enclosure had taken no other\r\nform than this, no storm of public protest would have risen, to\r\nexpress itself in pamphlets, sermons, statutes and government reports.\r\nEnclosure on a large scale involved dispossession of the inhabitants,\r\nand a complete break with traditional usage. For this reason the\r\nliterature of the subject is abundant. When, however, the process was\r\nreversed, and the land again brought under cultivation, there was\r\ninvolved no interference with the rights of common holders. It was to\r\nthe interest of no one to oppose this change, and no protest was made\r\nto call the attention of the historian to what was being done.\r\nReferences to the process are numerous enough only to prove that\r\nreconversion of land formerly laid to grass took place during the\r\nfifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries--to an extent of which\r\nnot even an approximate estimate can be made.\r\n\r\nImperfect as the evidence is from some points of view, it is\r\nnevertheless complete for the purposes of this monograph. It would be\r\nimpossible, with the material at hand, to reconstruct the progress of\r\nthe enclosure movement, decade by decade, and county by county,\r\nthroughout England. My intention, however, is not so much to describe\r\nthe movement in detail as it is to give a consistent account of its\r\nnature and causes. Even a few sixteenth-century instances of the\r\nplowing up of pasture land should be enough to arrest the attention of\r\nhistorians who believe that the conversion of arable land to pasture\r\nduring this period is sufficiently explained by an assertion that the\r\nprice of wool was high. What especial circumstances made it\r\nadvantageous to cultivate land which had been under grass, while other\r\nland was being withdrawn from cultivation? Contemporary writers speak\r\nof the need of worn land for rest for a long period of years, and\r\nremark that it will bear well again at the end of the period. Evidence\r\nsuch as this is significant without the further information which\r\nwould enable us to estimate the amount of land affected. For our\r\npurposes, also, the notice of enclosure of arable land for pasture on\r\none group of manors in the early thirteenth century is important as an\r\nindication that the fundamental cause of the enclosure movement was at\r\nwork long before the Black Death, which is usually taken as the event\r\nin which the movement had its beginning. Low rents, pauperism, and\r\nabandonment of land are facts which indicate declining productivity of\r\nthe soil, and statistical records of the harvests reaped are not\r\nneeded when statutes, proclamations, and books of husbandry describe\r\nthe exhausted condition of the common fields. The fact that the\r\nenclosure movement continued vigorously in the seventeenth century is\r\nconclusively established, and when this fact is known the\r\nimpossibility of estimating the comparative rate of progress of the\r\nmovement in the preceding century is of no importance. Upon one point\r\nat least, the evidence is almost all that could be desired. The\r\nmaterial for a comparison of the prices of wheat and wool throughout\r\nthe most critical portion of the period has been made accessible by\r\nThorold Rogers.[11] It is to this material that the defenders of the\r\ntheory that enclosures are explained by the price of wool should turn,\r\nfor they will find a fall of price where they assume that a rise took\r\nplace. Instead of an increase in the supply of wool due to a rise in\r\nits price, there is indicated a fall in the price of wool due to an\r\nincrease in the supply. The cause of the increase of the supply of\r\nwool must be sought outside of the price conditions.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment should here be made of my indebtedness to Dr. V. G.\r\nSimkhovitch of Columbia University, without whose generous help this\r\nstudy would not have been planned, and whose criticism and advice have\r\nbeen invaluable in bringing it to completion. Professor Seager also\r\nhas given helpful criticism. Professor Seligman has allowed me the use\r\nof books from his library which I should otherwise have been unable to\r\nobtain. For material which could not be found in American libraries I\r\nam indebted to my mother and father, who obtained it for me in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] V. G.

The\r\nconversion of arable land to pasture in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies is accounted for by the hypothesis that the price of wool\r\nwas rising more rapidly than that of grain. The beginning of the\r\nenclosure movement, according to this theory, dates from the time when\r\na rise in the price of wool became marked, and the movement ended when\r\nthere was a relative rise in the price of agricultural products.\r\nBefore the price of wool began to rise, it is supposed that tillage\r\nwas profitable enough, and that nothing but the higher profits to be\r\nmade from grazing induced landholders to abandon agriculture. The\r\nagrarian readjustments of the fourteenth century are regarded as due\r\nsimply to the temporary shortage of labor caused by the Black Death.\r\nHigh wages at this time caused the conversion of some land to pasture,\r\naccording to the orthodox theory, and from time to time during the\r\nnext two centuries high wages were a contributing factor influencing\r\nthe withdrawal of land from tillage; but the great and effective cause\r\nof the enclosure movement, the one fundamental fact which is insisted\r\nupon, is that constant advances in the price of wool made grazing\r\nrelatively profitable. It is usually accepted without debate that the\r\nwithdrawal of arable land from tillage did not begin until after the\r\nBlack Death, that the enclosures of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies were caused by a rise in the price of wool, and that the\r\nconversion of arable land to pasture ceased when this cause ceased to\r\noperate.\r\n\r\nAgainst this general explanation of the enclosure movement, it is\r\nurged, first, that the withdrawal of land from cultivation began long\r\nbefore the date at which the enclosure movement, caused by an alleged\r\nrise in the price of wool, is ordinarily said to have begun. The\r\nfourteenth century was marked by agrarian readjustments which have a\r\ndirect relation to the enclosure movement, and which cannot be\r\nexplained by the Black Death or the price of wool. Even in the\r\nthirteenth century the causes leading to the enclosure movement were\r\nwell marked. Secondly, the cause of the substitution of sheep-farming\r\nfor agriculture in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries cannot have\r\nbeen a rise in the price of wool relatively to that of grain, because\r\nstatistics show that the price of wool fell during the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and failed to rise as rapidly as that of wheat in the\r\nsixteenth century. Thirdly, a mere comparison of the relative prices\r\nof grazing and agricultural products cannot explain the fact that\r\nconversion of open-field land to pasture continued throughout the\r\nseventeenth century in spite of prices which made it profitable for\r\nlandowners at the same time to convert a large amount of grass-land to\r\ntillage, including enclosures which had formerly been taken from the\r\ncommon fields. If these facts are accepted the explanation of the\r\nenclosure movement which is based upon a comparison of the prices of\r\nwheat and wool must be rejected, and the story must be told from a\r\ndifferent point of view.\r\n\r\nTaking up these points in order, we shall inquire first into the\r\ncauses of the agrarian readjustments of the fourteenth century. A\r\ngeneration after the Black Death, the commutation of villain services\r\nand the introduction of the leasehold system had made notable\r\nprogress. The leasing of the demesne has been attributed to the\r\ndirect influence of the pestilence, which by reducing the serf\r\npopulation made it impossible to secure enough villain labor to\r\ncultivate the lord's land. The substitution of money rents in place of\r\nthe labor services owed by the villains has been explained on the\r\nsupposition that the serfs who had survived the pestilence took\r\nadvantage of the opportunity afforded by their reduction in numbers to\r\nfree themselves from servile labor and thus improve their social\r\nstatus. The connection between the Black Death and the changes in\r\nmanorial management which are usually attributed to it could be more\r\nconvincingly established had not several decades elapsed after the\r\nBlack Death before these changes became marked. A recent intensive\r\nstudy of the manors of the Bishopric of Winchester during this period\r\nconfirms the view of those who have protested against assigning to the\r\nBlack Death the revolutionary importance which is given it by many\r\nhistorians. On these estates the Black Death \"produced severe\r\nevanescent effects and temporary changes, with a rapid return to the\r\n_status quo_ of 1348.\"[12] The great changes which are usually\r\nattributed to the plague of 1348-1350 were under way before 1348, and\r\nwere not greatly accelerated until 1360, possibly not before 1370, and\r\ncannot, therefore, have been due to the Black Death.\r\n\r\nLevett and Ballard devote especial attention to the effect of the\r\nBlack Death upon the substitution of money payments for labor services\r\nand rents in kind, but their study also brings out the fact that the\r\ndifficulty in persuading tenants to take up land on the old terms\r\n(usually ascribed to the Black Death) began before the pestilence, and\r\ncontinued long after its effects had ceased to exert any influence.\r\nBefore the Black Death landowners were unable to secure holders for\r\nbond land without the use of force. A generation after the Black Death\r\nthey were still contending with this problem, and it had become more\r\nserious than at any previous time. Whatever the significance of the\r\nBlack Death, it must not be advanced as the explanation of a condition\r\nwhich arose before its occurrence, nor of events which took place long\r\nafter its effects were forgotten. One result of the pestilence was,\r\nindeed, to place villains in a stronger position than before, but the\r\nchanges which took place on this account must not be allowed to\r\nobscure the fact that landowners were already facing serious\r\ndifficulties before 1348. Holders of land were already deserting, and\r\nthe tenements of those who died or deserted could frequently be filled\r\nonly by compulsion. Villains were refusing to perform their services\r\n_on account of poverty_, and they were already securing reductions in\r\ntheir rents and services. The temporary reduction of the population by\r\nthe Black Death has been advanced as the reason for the ability of the\r\nvillains of the decade 1350-1360 to enforce their demands; but without\r\nthe help of any such cause, villains of an earlier period were\r\nobtaining concessions from their lords, and after the natural growth\r\nof the population had had ample time to replace those who had died of\r\nthe pestilence, the villains were in a stronger position than ever\r\nbefore, if we are to estimate their strength by their success in\r\nlightening their economic burdens. The Black Death at the most did no\r\nmore than accelerate changes in the tenure of land which were already\r\nunder way. Villain services were being reduced, and the size of\r\nvillain holdings increased. The strength of the position of the serfs\r\nlay not so much in the absence of competition due to a temporary\r\nreduction in their numbers as in their poverty. Tenants could not be\r\nheld at the accustomed rents and services because it was impossible to\r\nmake a living from their holdings. The absence of competition for\r\nholdings was no temporary thing, due to the high mortality of the\r\nyears 1348-1350, but was chronic, and was based upon the worthlessness\r\nof the land. The vacant tenements of the fourteenth century, the\r\nreduction in the area of demesne land planted, the complaints that no\r\nprofit could be made from tillage, the reduction of rents on account\r\nof the poverty of whole villages, all point in the same direction.\r\nThese matters will be taken up more fully in a later chapter. Here it\r\nneed only be pointed out that the withdrawal of land from cultivation\r\nwas under way because tillage was unprofitable.\r\n\r\nIf tillage was unprofitable in the fourteenth century, so unprofitable\r\nthat heirs were anxious to buy themselves free of the obligation to\r\nenter upon their inheritance, while established landholders deserted\r\ntheir tenements, the enclosure of arable land for pasture in the\r\nfifteenth century is seen in a new light. When there was no question\r\nof desiring the land for sheep pasture, it was voluntarily abandoned\r\nby cultivators. Displacement of tillage due to an internal cause\r\nprecedes displacement of tillage for sheep pasture. The process of\r\nwithdrawing land from cultivation began independently of the scarcity\r\nof labor caused by the Black Death and independently of any change in\r\nthe price of wool; the continuation of this process in the fifteenth\r\ncentury is not likely to depend entirely upon a rise in the price of\r\nwool. That the enclosures of the fifteenth century were in reality\r\nmerely a further step in the readjustments under way in the fourteenth\r\ncentury cannot be doubted. And that the whole process was independent\r\nof the especial external influence upon agriculture exerted in the\r\nfourteenth century by the Black Death and in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries by the growth of the woollen industry is shown in\r\nthe case of a group of manors where the essential features of the\r\nenclosure movement appeared in the thirteenth century. More than a\r\nhundred years before the Black Death the Lord of Berkeley found it\r\nimpossible to obtain tenants for bond land at the accustomed rents.\r\nVillains were giving up their holdings because they could not pay the\r\nrent and perform the services. The land which had in earlier times\r\nbeen sufficient for the maintenance of a villain and his family and\r\nhad produced a surplus for rent had lost its fertility, and the\r\nholdings fell vacant. The land which reverted to the lord on this\r\naccount was split up and leased at nominal rents, when leaseholders\r\ncould be found, just as so much land was leased at reduced rents by\r\nlandowners generally in the fourteenth century. Moreover, some of the\r\nland was unfit for cultivation at all and was converted to pasture\r\nunder the direction of the lord.[13]\r\n\r\nIf the disintegration of manorial organization observed in the\r\nfourteenth century and earlier was not due to the Black Death; if this\r\ndisintegration was under way before the pestilence reduced the\r\npopulation, and was not checked when the ravages of the plague had\r\nbeen made good; if tillage was already unprofitable before the\r\nfifteenth century with its growth of the woollen industry; and if land\r\nwas being converted to pasture at a time when neither the price of\r\nwool nor the Black Death can be offered as the explanation of this\r\nconversion; then there is suggested the possibility that the whole\r\nenclosure movement can be sufficiently accounted for without especial\r\nreference to the prices of wool and grain. If the enclosure movement\r\nbegan before the fifteenth century and originated in causes other than\r\nthe Black Death, the discovery of these original causes may also\r\nfurnish the explanation of the continuance of the movement in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The amount of land under\r\ncultivation was being reduced before the date at which the price of\r\nwool is supposed to have risen sufficiently to displace agriculture\r\nfor the sake of wool growing, and this early reduction in the arable\r\ncannot, clearly, be accounted for by reference to the prices of wool\r\nand grain. But it also happens that, in the very period when an\r\nincrease in the demand for wool is usually alleged as the cause of the\r\nenclosures, the price of wool fell relatively to that of grain. The\r\nincrease in sheep-farming in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\r\ntogether with the fact that the domestic cloth manufacture was being\r\nimproved at this time, has been the basis of the assumption that the\r\nprice of wool was rising. The causal sequence has been supposed to be:\r\n(1) an increase in the manufacture of woollens; (2) an increase in the\r\ndemand for wool; (3) an increase in the price of wool; (4) an increase\r\nin wool-growing at the expense of tillage, and the enclosure of common\r\nlands. If, as a matter of fact, the price of wool fell during this\r\nperiod, the causal sequence is reversed. If the price of wool fell,\r\nthe increase in the manufacture of woollens has no relation to the\r\nenclosure movement, unless it is its result, and we are forced to look\r\nelsewhere for the cause of the increase of sheep-farming.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying tables and chart, showing the changes in the price of\r\nwool and of wheat from the middle of the thirteenth century through\r\nthe first quarter of the sixteenth century, have been prepared from\r\nthe materials given by Thorold Rogers in his _History of Agriculture\r\nand Prices in England_.[14] The averages given in his tables are based\r\nupon records of actual sales. They furnish, therefore, the exact\r\ninformation needed in connection with the theory that a rise in the\r\nprice of wool relatively to that of wheat was the cause of the\r\nenclosure movement in England. In the century and a half before 1400,\r\nthere were wide fluctuations in the prices of both commodities, but\r\nthe price of wool rose and fell with that of wheat. The first quarter\r\nof the fourteenth century was a period of falling prices. The fall\r\ncontinued in the case of wool until about the middle of the century,\r\nwhen a recovery began, culminating about 1380. A rise in the price of\r\nwheat occurred sooner than that of wool and reached its climax about\r\n1375. In the last quarter of the century the prices of both wool and\r\nwheat fell, with a slight recovery in the last decade of the century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE I\r\n\r\n    PRICES OF WHEAT AND WOOL, 1261-1582.

It is in this period that the woollen\r\nindustry entered upon the period of expansion which is supposed to\r\nhave been the cause of the enclosure movement, but there was no rise\r\nin the price of wool. Instead, there was a decided fall.[15] The\r\naverage price for the decade 1451-1460 was just about one-half of the\r\naverage price for the period 1261-1400. (The average price of wool in\r\nthe last fifty years of the fourteenth century happens to be the same\r\nas the average for the period 1261-1400. Either the longer or the\r\nshorter period may be used indifferently as the basis for comparison).\r\nThe average price for the period 1401-1460 was 25 per cent lower than\r\nthe average for the preceding half-century. A comparatively slight\r\ndepression in the price of wheat in the same period is shown in the\r\ntables. The average for 1401-1461 is only three per cent lower than\r\nthat for 1265-1400 (seven per cent lower than the average for\r\n1351-1400). Before 1460, then, there was nothing in market conditions\r\nto favor the extension of sheep farming, but there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the withdrawal of land from tillage had already begun.\r\nLeaving aside the enclosure and conversion of common-field land by the\r\nBerkeleys in the thirteenth century, we may yet note that \"An early\r\ncomplaint of illegal enclosure occurs in 1414 where the inhabitants of\r\nParleton and Ragenell in Notts petition against Richard Stanhope, who\r\nhad inclosed the lands there by force of arms.\" Miss Leonard, who is\r\nauthority for this statement, also refers to the statute of 1402 in\r\nwhich \"depopulatores agrorum\" are mentioned.[16] In a grant of Edward\r\nV the complaint is made that \"this body falleth daily to decay by\r\nclosures and emparking, by driving away of tenants and letting down of\r\ntenantries.\"[17] It is strange, if these enclosures are to be\r\nexplained by increasing demand for wool, that this heightened demand\r\nwas not already reflected in rising prices.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be urged, the true enclosure movement did not begin until\r\nafter 1460. If a marked rise in the price of wool occurred after 1460,\r\nit might be argued that enclosures spread and the price of wool rose\r\ntogether, and that the latter was the cause of the former. Turning\r\nagain to the record of prices, we see that although the low level of\r\nthe decade 1451-1460 marks the end of the period of falling prices, no\r\nrise took place for several decades after 1460. Rous gives a list of\r\n54 places \"which, within a circuit of thirteen miles about Warwick\r\nhad been wholly or partially depopulated before about 1486.\"[18] Two\r\nor three years later acts were passed against depopulation in whose\r\npreambles the agrarian situation is described: The Isle of Wight \"is\r\nlate decayed of people, by reason that many townes and vilages been\r\nlete downe and the feldes dyked and made pastures for bestis and\r\ncattalles.\" In other parts of England there is \"desolacion and pulling\r\ndowne and wylfull wast of houses and towns ... and leying to pasture\r\nlondes whiche custumably haue ben used in tylthe, wherby ydlenesse is\r\ngrowde and begynnyng of all myschevous dayly doth encrease. For where\r\nin some townes ii hundred persones were occupied and lived by their\r\nlawfull labours, now ben there occupied ii or iii herdemen, and the\r\nresidue falle in ydlenes.\"[19] It may be remarked that while the price\r\nrecords show conclusively that no rise in the profits of wool-growing\r\ncaused these enclosures, the language of the statutes shows also that\r\nscarcity of labor was not their cause, since one of the chief\r\nobjections to the increase of pasture is the unemployment caused.\r\n\r\nIt would seem hardly necessary to push the comparison of the prices of\r\nwool and wheat beyond 1490. In order to establish the contention that\r\nthe enclosure movement was caused by an advance in the price of wool,\r\nit would be necessary to show that this advance took place before the\r\ndate at which the enclosure problem had become so serious as to be the\r\nsubject of legislation. By 1490 statesmen were already alarmed at the\r\nprogress made by enclosure. The movement was well under way. Yet it\r\nhas been shown that the price of wool had been falling for over a\r\ncentury, instead of rising, and that the price of wheat held its own.\r\nEven if it could be established that the price of wheat fell as\r\ncompared with that of wool after this date, the usually accepted\r\nversion of the enclosure movement would still be inadequate. But as a\r\nmatter of fact the price of wheat rose steadily after 1490, reaching a\r\nhigher average in each succeeding decade, while the price of wool\r\nwavered about an average which rose very slowly until 1535. The\r\nentries on which these wool averages are based are few, and greater\r\nuncertainty therefore attaches to their representativeness than in the\r\ncase of the prices of earlier decades, but the evidence, such as it\r\nis, points to a more rapid rise in the price of wheat than in the\r\nprice of wool. Between 1500 and 1540 the average price of wheat was\r\nnearly 24 per cent above that of the previous forty years, but the\r\naverage price of wool rose only ten per cent. There are only nine\r\nentries of wool prices for the forty-six years after 1536, but these\r\nare enough to show that the price of wool, like that of wheat and all\r\nother commodities, was rising rapidly at this time. The lack of\r\nmaterial upon which to base a comparison of the actual rate of\r\nincrease of price for the two commodities makes further statistical\r\nanalysis impossible, but a knowledge of prices after the date at which\r\nthe material ceases would add nothing to the evidence on the subject\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More's _Utopia_ was written in 1516, with its well-known\r\npassage describing contemporary enclosures in terms similar to those\r\nused in the statutes of thirty years before, and complaining that the\r\nsheep\r\n\r\n     that were wont to be so meke and tame, and so smal eaters, now,\r\n     as I heare saye, be become so great devowerers and so wylde, that\r\n     they eate up, and swallow downe the very men them selfes. They\r\n     consume, destroye, and devoure whole fields, howses, and cities.\r\n     For looke in what partes of the realme doth growe the fynest, and\r\n     therfore dearest woll, there noblemen, and gentlemen: yea and\r\n     certeyn Abbottes ... leave no grounde for tillage, thei inclose\r\n     al into pastures: thei throw doune houses: they plucke downe\r\n     townes, and leave nothing standynge, but only the churche to be\r\n     made a shepe-howse.[20]\r\n\r\nThese enclosures were not caused by an advance in the price of wool\r\nrelatively to that of wheat, as the rise in the price of wool in the\r\ndecade 1510-1520 was no greater than that of corn. Nor does sheep\r\nfarming seem to have been especially profitable at this time, as More\r\nhimself attributes the high price of wool in part to a \"pestiferous\r\nmorrein.\" Again, the complaint is also made that unemployment was\r\ncaused, showing that scarcity of labor was not the reason for the\r\nconversion of arable to pasture:\r\n\r\n     The husbandmen be thrust owte of their owne, ... whom no man wyl\r\n     set a worke, though thei never so willyngly profre themselves\r\n     therto. For one Shephearde or Heardman is ynoughe to eate up that\r\n     grounde with cattel, to the occupiyng wherof aboute husbandrye\r\n     manye handes were requisite.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1514 a new husbandry statute was passed, penalising the conversion\r\nof tillage to pasture, and requiring the restoration of the land to\r\ntillage. It was repeated and made perpetual in the following year. In\r\n1517 a commission was ordered to enquire into the destruction of\r\nhouses since 1488 and the conversion of arable to pasture. In 1518 a\r\nfresh commission was issued and the prosecution of offenders was\r\nbegun. These facts are cited as a further reminder of the fact that\r\nthe period for which the prices of wool and wheat are both known is\r\nthe critical period in the enclosure movement. It is the enclosures\r\ncovered by these acts and those referred to by Sir Thomas More which\r\nhistorians have explained by alleging that the price of wool was\r\nhigh. As a matter of record, the course of prices was such as to\r\nencourage the extension of tillage rather than of pasture.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination of these price statistics it hardly seems\r\nnecessary to advance further objections to the accepted account of the\r\nenclosure movement, based as it is upon the assumption that price\r\nmovements in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were exactly\r\nopposite to those which have been shown to take place. There is no\r\nreason to doubt the accuracy of Rogers' figures within the limits\r\nrequired for our purpose, and the evidence based on these figures is\r\nin itself conclusive. Even without this evidence, however, there is\r\nsufficient reason for rejecting the theory that changes in the prices\r\nof grain and wool account for the facts of the enclosure movement. For\r\none thing, if the price of wool actually did rise (in spite of the\r\nstatistical evidence to the contrary) and if this is actually the\r\ncause of the enclosure movement, the movement should have come to an\r\nend when sufficient time had elapsed for an adjustment of the wool\r\nsupply to the increasing demand. If the movement did not come to an\r\nend within a reasonable period, there would be reason for suspecting\r\nthe adequacy of the explanation advanced. As a matter of fact, it is\r\nusually thought that the enclosure movement did end about 1600. Much\r\nland which had not been affected by the changes of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries (it is usually asserted) escaped enclosure\r\naltogether until the need for better agriculture in the eighteenth\r\ncentury ushered in the so-called second enclosure movement, which did\r\nnot involve the conversion of tilled land to pasture. This alleged\r\ncheck in the progress of the enclosure movement is inferred from the\r\nfact that new land, and even some of the land formerly withdrawn from\r\nthe common-fields to be converted to pasture, was being tilled. This\r\nis interpreted by economic historians as evidence that arable land\r\nwas no longer being converted to pasture. We are told by Meredith, for\r\ninstance, that \"Moneyed men at the end of Elizabeth's reign were\r\nbeginning to find it profitable to sink money in arable farming, a\r\nfact which points to the conclusion that there was no longer any\r\ndifferential advantage in sheep-raising.\"[22] Cunningham is also of\r\nthe opinion that \"So far as such a movement can be definitely dated,\r\nit may be said that enclosure for the sake of increasing sheep-farming\r\nalmost entirely ceased with the reign of Elizabeth.\"[23] Innes gives\r\nas the cause of this supposed check in the reduction of arable land to\r\npasture that \"The expansion of pasturage appears to have reached the\r\nlimit beyond which it would have ceased to be profitable.\"[24] It is\r\nindeed reasonable that the high prices which are supposed to have been\r\nthe cause of the sudden increase in wool production should be\r\ngradually lowered as the supply increased, and that thus the\r\ninducement to the conversion of arable to pasture would in time\r\ndisappear. The theory that the enclosure movement was due to an\r\nincrease in the price of wool would be seriously weakened if the\r\nmovement continued for a time longer than that required to bring about\r\nan adjustment of the supply to the increased demand.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of consistency, then, this point in the account of the\r\nenclosure movement is necessary. It would follow naturally from the\r\noriginal explanation of the movement as the response to an increased\r\ndemand for wool, as reflected in high prices. With the decrease in\r\nprices to be expected as the supply increased, the incentive for\r\nconverting arable to pasture would be removed. Historians sometimes\r\nspeak of other considerations which might have contributed to the\r\ncessation of the enclosure movement. Ashley, for instance, suggests\r\nthat landowners found that to \"devote their lands continuously to\r\nsheep-breeding did not turn out quite so profitable as was at first\r\nexpected.\"[25] Others refer to the contemporary complaints of the bad\r\neffect of enclosure upon the quality of wool. The breed of sheep which\r\ncould be kept in enclosed pastures was said to produce coarser wool\r\nthan those grazing on the hilly pastures, and this deterioration in\r\nthe quality of wool so cut down the profits from enclosures that men\r\nnow preferred to plow them up again, and resume tillage. The extent to\r\nwhich the plowing up of pasture can be attributed to this cause must\r\nbe very slight, however, as even contemporaries disagreed as to the\r\nexistence of any deterioration in the quality of the wool. Some\r\nauthorities even state that the quality was improved by the use of\r\nenclosed pasture: when Cornwall,\r\n\r\n     through want of good manurance lay waste and open, the sheep had\r\n     generally little bodies and coarse fleeces, so as their wool bare\r\n     no better name than Cornish hair ... but since the grounds began\r\n     to receive enclosure and dressing for tillage, the nature of the\r\n     soil hath altered to a better grain and yieldeth nourishment in\r\n     greater abundance to the beasts that pasture thereupon; so as, by\r\n     this means ... Cornish sheep come but little behind the eastern\r\n     flocks for bigness of mould, _fineness of wool, etc._[26]\r\n\r\nThe plowing up of pasture land for tillage cannot, then, be explained\r\nby the effect of enclosure upon the quality of wool. It has been\r\nordinarily taken as an indication that the price of grain was now\r\nrising more rapidly than that of wool, partly because a relaxation of\r\nthe corn-laws permitted greater freedom of export, and partly because\r\nthe home demand was increasing on account of the growth of the\r\npopulation. Graziers were as willing to convert pastures to\r\ncorn-fields for the sake of greater profits as their predecessors had\r\nbeen to carry out the contrary process. The deciding factor in the\r\nsituation, according to the orthodox account, was the relative price\r\nof wool and grain. When the price of wool rose more rapidly than that\r\nof grain, arable land was enclosed and used for grazing. When the\r\nprice of grain rose more rapidly than that of wool, pastures were\r\nplowed up and cultivated.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, the account is consistent. If the price of wool was\r\nrising more rapidly than that of grain during the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries (in spite of the statistical evidence to the\r\ncontrary) it is reasonable that the differential advantage in grazing\r\nshould finally come to an end when a new balance between tillage and\r\ngrazing was established. It is not even surprising that the conversion\r\nof arable to pasture should have continued beyond the proper point,\r\nand that a contrary movement should set in. Bacon, in 1592, remarked\r\nthat men had of late been enticed by the good yield of corn and the\r\nincreased freedom of export to \"break up more ground and convert it to\r\ntillage than all the penal laws for that purpose made and enacted\r\ncould ever by compulsion effect.\"[27] In 1650 Lord Monson plowed up\r\n100 acres of Grafton Park, which had formerly been pasture, and there\r\nare many other records showing a tendency to convert pasture to arable\r\nin the seventeenth century.[28] It is true that men were able to make\r\na profit from agriculture by the end of the sixteenth century. But\r\nthere is one difficulty which has been overlooked: the withdrawal\r\nfrom agriculture of common-field land did _not_ cease. The protests\r\nagainst depopulating enclosure continue, and government reports and\r\nsurveys show that enclosure for pasture was proceeding at as rapid a\r\nrate as in the sixteenth century. Miss Leonard's article on \"Inclosure\r\nof Common Fields in the Seventeenth Century\"[29] contains a mass of\r\nevidence which is conclusive. A few quotations will indicate its\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n    \"In Leicestershire the enclosures of Cottesbach in 1602, of Enderby\r\n    about 1605, of Thornby about 1616, were all accomplished by a\r\n    lessening of the land under the plough. Moore, writing in 1656,\r\n    says: 'Surely they may make men as soon believe there is no sun in\r\n    the firmament as that usually depopulation and decay of tillage will\r\n    not follow inclosure in our inland countyes.'\" (p. 117). Letters\r\n    from the Council were written in 1630 complaining of \"'enclosures\r\n    and convercons tending as they generallie doe unto depopulation....\r\n    There appeares many great inclosures ... all wch are or are lyke to\r\n    turne to the conversion of much ground from errable to pasture and\r\n    be very hurtfull to the commonwealth.... We well know wth all what\r\n    ye consequence will be, and in conclusion all turne to\r\n    depopulation!'\" (p. 128). Forster, writing in 1664, says, \"there\r\n    hath been of late years divers whole lordships and towns enclosed\r\n    and their earable land converted into pasture!\" (p. 142).\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently the same proprietor in the same year plowed up pasture land\r\nfor corn and laid arable to pasture. Tawney cites a case in which\r\nninety-five acres of ancient pasture were brought under cultivation\r\nwhile thirty-five acres of arable were laid to grass.[30] In 1630 the\r\nCountess of Westmoreland enclosed and converted arable, but tilled\r\nother land instead.[31] The enclosure movement, then, did not end at\r\nthe time when it is usually thought to have ended. Since it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that the price of wool could have been advancing\r\nconstantly throughout two centuries, without causing such a\r\nreadjustment in the use of land that no further withdrawal of land\r\nfrom tillage for pasture would be necessary, the continuance of the\r\nconversion of arable to pasture in the seventeenth century throws\r\nsuspicion upon the whole explanation of the enclosure movement as due\r\nto the increased demand for wool.\r\n\r\nMiss Leonard, indeed, advances the hypothesis that the price of wool\r\nceased to be the cause of enclosure during the seventeenth century,\r\nbut that other price changes had the same effect:\r\n\r\n     The increase in pasture in the sixteenth century was rendered\r\n     profitable by the rapid increase in the price of wool, but, in\r\n     the seventeenth century, this cause ceases to operate. The change\r\n     to pasture, however, continued, partly owing to a great rise in\r\n     the price of cattle, and partly because the increase in wages\r\n     made it less profitable to employ the greater number of men\r\n     necessary for tilling the fields.[32]\r\n\r\nThe assumption that wages and the price of cattle advanced\r\nsufficiently in the seventeenth century to account for the change to\r\npasture are no better justified than the assumption of the rapid rise\r\nin the price of wool in the sixteenth century. If the price of meat\r\nand dairy products rose in the seventeenth century, so did the price\r\nof grain and other foods. The relative rate of increase is the only\r\npoint significant for the present discussion. No statistics are\r\navailable to show whether the price of cattle rose more rapidly than\r\nthat of grain, and the evidence afforded by the reduction of arable\r\nland to pasture is counterbalanced by the equally well-established\r\nfact that much pasture land was plowed and planted in this period. It\r\nis equally probable on the basis of this evidence that the prices of\r\nwheat and barley advanced more rapidly than those of meat and butter\r\nand cheese. The same difficulty is met in the suggestion that the\r\nincrease in pasturage was due partly to higher wages for farm labor.\r\nThe extension of tillage over much land formerly laid to pasture as\r\nwell as that which had never been plowed at all is sufficient cause\r\nfor doubting a prohibitive increase in wages. Moreover, in modern\r\ntimes, wages lag in general rise of prices. Unless conclusive evidence\r\nis presented to show that this was not the case in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, it must be assumed to be inherently probable that the\r\nincreased wages of the time were more than offset by the rapidly\r\nadvancing prices.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century, then, when it is admitted that the\r\nhigh price of wool was not the cause which induced landowners to\r\nconvert arable to pasture, it cannot be shown that the high price of\r\ncattle or exorbitant wages will account for the withdrawal of land\r\nfrom cultivation. This is an important point, for historians\r\nfrequently support their main contention with regard to the enclosure\r\nmovement (_i. e._, that it was caused by an increase in the price of\r\nwool), by the statement that increasing wages made landlords abandon\r\ntillage for sheep-farming, with its smaller labor charges. It has been\r\nshown that the conversion of arable to pasture in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries cannot be explained by the price of wool, but it\r\nmay still be urged that agriculture was rendered unprofitable by high\r\nwages. Indeed, it is usually stated that the withdrawal of land from\r\ncultivation which took place in the fourteenth century was due to the\r\nscarcity of labor caused by the Black Death. In the fifteenth century\r\npopulation was reduced by the Wars of the Roses; and throughout the\r\nperiod under consideration, agriculture had to meet the competition of\r\nthe growing town industries for labor. Is it not possible that these\r\ninfluences caused an exorbitant rise in wages which would alone\r\naccount for the substitution of sheep-farming for tillage?\r\n\r\nThe obvious character of the enclosure movement makes it impossible to\r\naccept this hypothesis. The conversion of arable land to pasture was\r\ncaused by no demand for higher wages, which made tillage unprofitable.\r\nThe unemployment and pauperism caused by the enclosure of the open\r\nfields are notorious, and it is to these features of the enclosure\r\nmovement that we owe the mass of literature on the subject. Enclosures\r\ncalled forth a storm of protest, because they took away the living of\r\npoor husbandry families. The acute distress undergone by those who\r\nwere evicted from their holdings is sufficient indication of the\r\ndifficulty of finding employment, and it is impossible that wages\r\ncould remain at an exorbitant level when the enclosure of the lands of\r\none open-field township made enough men homeless to supply any\r\nexisting dearth of labor in all of the surrounding villages. If\r\nagriculture was unprofitable, it was not because laborers demanded\r\nexcessive wages, but because of the low productivity of the land. The\r\nsignificance of contemporary complaints of high wages is missed if\r\nthey are interpreted as an indication of an exorbitant increase in\r\nwages. The facts are, rather, that land was so unproductive that\r\nfarmers could not afford to pay even a low wage.\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary to argue the point further, it could be pointed\r\nout that wages even in industry were not subject to that steady rise\r\nwhich would have to be assumed, if high wages are to furnish the\r\nexplanation of the substitution of pasture for tillage from the\r\nthirteenth century to the eighteenth. The statistical data on this\r\nsubject are fragmentary, but Thorold Rogers' calculations for the\r\nperiod 1540-1582 are significant. In this period wages rose 60 per\r\ncent above the average of the previous century and a half; but the\r\nmarket prices of farm produce rose 170 per cent.[33] The rise in wages\r\nwas far from keeping pace with the rise in selling prices, and the\r\ndisplacement of agriculture for grazing at this time must be due to\r\nsome cause other than the greater number of laborers needed in\r\nagriculture. If, during certain periods within the four centuries\r\nunder consideration wages advanced more rapidly than the prices of\r\nproduce (statistical information on this subject is lacking) the\r\ncontinuous withdrawal of land from tillage during periods when wages\r\nfell remains to be explained by some cause other than high wages. Nor\r\ncan high wages account for the conversion of tilled land to pasture\r\nsimultaneously with the conversion of pasture land to tillage in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIf wages were exorbitantly high in the seventeenth century, and if\r\nthis is the reason for the laying to pasture of so much arable, how\r\ncould farmers afford to cultivate the large amount of fresh land which\r\nthey were bringing under the plow? Is this accounted for not by any\r\nexpectation of profit from this land but by the statutory requirement\r\nthat no arable should be laid to pasture unless an equal amount of\r\ngrass land were plowed in its stead? Pasture in excess of the legal\r\nrequirements was plowed up, and persons who did not wish to convert\r\nany arable to pasture are found increasing their tilled land by\r\nbringing grass land under cultivation. The movement cannot be\r\nexplained, therefore, merely on the basis of the husbandry statutes.\r\nNor is the law itself to be dismissed without further examination, for\r\nin it we find the explicit statement that fresh land could be\r\nsubstituted for that then under cultivation, because common-field land\r\nwas in many cases exhausted; it was therefore better to allow this to\r\nbe laid to grass while better land was cultivated in its place.[34]\r\nHere then, is the simple explanation of the whole problem. The land\r\nwhich was converted from arable to pasture was worn out; but there was\r\nfresh land available for tillage, and some of this was brought under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nNo alternative explanation can be worked out on the basis of\r\nhypothetical wage or price movements. The historian is indeed at\r\nliberty to form his own theories as to the trend of prices in the\r\nseventeenth century, for he is unhampered by the existence of known\r\nrecords such as those for the sixteenth century; but it is impossible\r\nto construct any theory of prices which will explain why the\r\nconversion of arable land to pasture continued at a time when much\r\npasture land was being plowed up. It is necessary to choose a theory\r\nof prices which will explain either the extension of tillage or the\r\nextension of pasture; both cannot be explained by the same prices. If,\r\nas some historians assume, the increase of population or some such\r\nfactor was causing a comparatively rapid increase in the price of\r\ngrain in this period, the continued conversion of arable to pasture\r\nrequires explanation. If, as Miss Leonard supposes, the contrary\r\nassumption is true, and the products of arable land could be sold to\r\nless advantage than those of pasture, then the cause of the conversion\r\nof pasture to arable must be sought.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the seventeenth century that this double conversion\r\nmovement took place. In the second half of the fourteenth century\r\npastures were being plowed up. At Holway, 1376-1377, three plots of\r\nland which had been pasture were converted to arable.[35] In this\r\nperiod much land was withdrawn from cultivation. The explanation\r\nusually advanced by historians for the conversion of arable to pasture\r\nat this time is that the scarcity of labor since the Black Death (a\r\nquarter of a century before) made it impossible to cultivate the land\r\nas extensively as when wages were low, or when serf labor was\r\navailable. If this is the whole case, it is difficult to account for\r\nthe conversion to arable of land already pasture. Other factors than\r\nthe supposed scarcity of labor were involved; land in good condition,\r\nsuch as the plots of pasture at Holway, repaid cultivation, but the\r\nyield was too low on land exhausted by centuries of cultivation to\r\nmake tillage profitable.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, also, the restoration of cultivation on land\r\nwhich had formerly been converted from arable to pasture was going on.\r\nFitzherbert devotes several chapters of his treatise on surveying to a\r\ndiscussion of the methods of amending \"ley grounde, the whiche hath\r\nben errable lande of late,\" (ch. 27) and \"bushy ground and mossy that\r\nhath ben errable lande of olde time\" (ch. 28). This land should be\r\nplowed and sown, and it will produce much grain, \"with littell\r\ndongynge, and sow it no lengar tha it will beare plentye of corne,\r\nwithoute donge\", and then lay it down to grass again. Tusser also\r\ndescribes this use of land alternately as pasture and arable.[36] A\r\nfarmer on one of the manors of William, First Earl of Pembroke, had an\r\nenclosed field in 1567, which afforded pasture for 900 sheep as well\r\nas an unspecified number of cattle, \"_qui aliquando seminatur,\r\naliquando iacet ad pasturam_.\"[37] The motives of this alternating use\r\nof the land would be clear enough, even though they were not\r\nexplicitly stated by contemporaries; arable land which would produce\r\nonly scant crops unless heavily manured made good pasture, and after a\r\nlonger or shorter period under grass, was so improved by the manure of\r\nthe sheep pasturing on it and by the heavy sod which formed that it\r\ncould be tilled profitably, and was therefore restored to tillage.\r\n\r\nThe fact of two opposite but simultaneous conversion movements is\r\nunaccountable under the accepted hypothesis of the causes of the\r\nenclosure movement, which turns upon assumptions as to the relative\r\nprices of grain and wool or cattle or wages. The authorities for this\r\ntheory have necessarily neglected the evidence that pasture land was\r\nconverted to arable in the sixteenth century and that arable land was\r\nconverted to pasture in the seventeenth, and have separated in time\r\ntwo tendencies which were simultaneous. They have described the\r\nincrease in pasturage at the expense of arable in the early period,\r\nand the increase of arable at the expense of pasture in the later\r\nperiod, and have explained a difference between the two periods which\r\ndid not exist by a change in the ratio between the prices of wool and\r\ngrain for which no proof is given.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in this chapter that the conversion of arable to\r\npasture in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries cannot have been\r\ncaused by increased demand for wool, since the price of wool\r\nrelatively to that of grain fell, and the extension of tillage rather\r\nthan of pasture would have taken place had price movements been the\r\nchief factor influencing the conversion of land from one use to the\r\nother. It has also been shown that the conversion of arable to\r\npasture did not cease at the beginning of the seventeenth century. If\r\nthe principal cause of the enclosure movement had been the increasing\r\ndemand for wool, this cause would have ceased to operate when time had\r\nelapsed for the shifting of enough land from tillage to pasture to\r\nincrease the supply of wool. That the conversion of arable to pasture\r\ndid not cease after a reasonable time had passed is an indication that\r\nits cause was not the demand for wool. When it is found that pasture\r\nwas being converted to arable at the same time that other land was\r\nwithdrawn from cultivation and laid to grass, the insufficiency of the\r\naccepted explanation of the enclosure movement is made even more\r\napparent. A change in the price of wool could at best explain the\r\nconversion in one direction only. The theory that the cause of the\r\nenclosure movement was the high price of wool must be rejected, and a\r\nmore critical study must be made of the readjustments in the use of\r\nland which became conspicuous in the fourteenth century, but which are\r\noverlooked in the orthodox account of the enclosure movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[12] Levett and Ballard, _The Black Death on the Estates of the See of\r\nWinchester_ (Oxford, 1916), p. 142.\r\n\r\n[13] Smyth, _Lives of the Berkeleys_ (Gloucester, 1883), vol. i, pp.\r\n113-160.\r\n\r\n[14] (Oxford, 1866-1902), vols. i, iv.\r\n\r\n[15] Increase in manufacture of woollen cloth constituted no increase\r\nin the demand for wool in so far as exports of raw wool were reduced.\r\n\r\n[16] _Royal Historical Soc.

It is now necessary to consider\r\nmore closely the true cause of the conversion of arable land to\r\npasture--the declining productivity of the soil--and the cause of the\r\nrestoration of this land to cultivation--the restoration of its\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nThe connection between soil fertility and the system of husbandry has\r\nbeen explained by Dr. Russell, of the Rothamsted Experiment Station:\r\n\r\n     Virgin land covered with its native vegetation appears to alter\r\n     very little and very slowly in composition. Plants spring up,\r\n     assimilate the soil nitrates, phosphates, potassium salts, etc.,\r\n     and make considerable quantities of nitrogenous and other organic\r\n     compounds: then they die and all this material is added to the\r\n     soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria also add to the stores of nitrogen\r\n     compounds. But, on the other hand, there are losses: some of the\r\n     added substances are dissipated as gas by the decomposition\r\n     bacteria, others are washed away in the drainage water. These\r\n     losses are small in poor soils, but they become greater in rich\r\n     soils, and they set a limit beyond which accumulation of material\r\n     cannot go. Thus a virgin soil does not become indefinitely rich\r\n     in nitrogenous and other organic compounds, but reaches an\r\n     equilibrium level where the annual gains are offset by the\r\n     annual losses so that no net change results. This equilibrium\r\n     level depends on the composition of the soil, its position, the\r\n     climate, etc, and it undergoes a change if any of these factors\r\n     alter. But for practical purposes it may be regarded as fairly\r\n     stationary.\r\n\r\n     When, however, the virgin soil is broken up by the plough and\r\n     brought into cultivation the native vegetation and the crop are\r\n     alike removed, and therefore the sources of gain are considerably\r\n     reduced. The losses, on the other hand, are much intensified.\r\n     Rain water more readily penetrates, carrying dissolved substances\r\n     with it: biochemical decompositions also proceed. In consequence\r\n     the soil becomes poorer, and finally it is reduced to the same\r\n     level as the rate of gain of nitrogenous matter. A new and lower\r\n     equilibrium level is now reached about which the composition of\r\n     the soil remains fairly constant; this is determined by the same\r\n     factors as the first, _i. e._ the composition of the soil,\r\n     climate, etc.\r\n\r\n     Thus each soil may vary in composition and therefore in fertility\r\n     between two limits: a higher limit if it is kept permanently\r\n     covered with vegetation such as grass, and a lower limit if it is\r\n     kept permanently under the plough. These limits are set by the\r\n     nature of the soil and the climate, but the cultivator can attain\r\n     any level he likes between them simply by changing his mode of\r\n     husbandry. The lower equilibrium level is spoken of as the\r\n     inherent fertility of the soil because it represents the part of\r\n     the fertility due to the soil and its surroundings, whilst the\r\n     level actually reached in any particular case is called its\r\n     condition or \"heart\", the land being in \"good heart \"or \"bad\r\n     heart\", according as the cultivator has pushed the actual level\r\n     up or not; this part of the fertility is due to the cultivator's\r\n     efforts.\r\n\r\n     The difference between the higher and lower fertility level is\r\n     not wholly a question of percentage of nitrogen, carbon, etc. At\r\n     its highest level the soil possesses a good physical texture\r\n     owing to the flocculation of the clay and the arrangement of the\r\n     particles: it can readily be got into the fine tilth needed for a\r\n     seed bed. But when it has run down the texture becomes very\r\n     unsatisfactory. Much calcium carbonate is also lost during the\r\n     process: and when this constituent falls too low, the soil\r\n     becomes \"sour\" and unsuited for crops.\r\n\r\n     The simplest system of husbandry is that of continuous wheat\r\n     cultivation, practiced under modern conditions in new countries.\r\n     When the virgin land is first broken up its fertility is high; so\r\n     long as it remains under cultivation this level can no longer be\r\n     maintained, but rapidly runs down. During this degradation\r\n     process considerable quantities of plant food become available\r\n     and a succession of crops can be raised without any substitution\r\n     of manure ... After a time the unstable period is over and the\r\n     new equilibrium level is reached at which the soil will stop if\r\n     the old husbandry continues. In this final state the soil is\r\n     often not fertile enough to allow of the profitable raising of\r\n     crops; it is now starving for want of those very nutrients that\r\n     were so prodigally dissipated in the first days of its\r\n     cultivation, and the cultivator starves with it or moves on.\r\n\r\n     Fortunately recovery is by no means impossible, though it may be\r\n     prolonged. It is only necessary to leave the land covered with\r\n     vegetation for a period of years when it will once again regain\r\n     much of the nitrogenous organic matter it has lost.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Russell adds that soil-exhaustion is essentially a modern\r\nphenomenon, however, and gives the following reasons for supposing\r\nthat the medieval system conserved the fertility of the soil. First,\r\nthe cattle grazed over a wide area and the arable land all received\r\nsome dung. Thus elements of fertility were transferred from the\r\npasture land to the smaller area of tilled land. This process, he\r\nadmits, involved the impoverishment of the pasture land, but only very\r\nslowly, and the fertility of the arable was in the meanwhile\r\nmaintained. Secondly, the processes of liming and marling the soil\r\nwere known, and by these means the necessary calcium carbonate was\r\nsupplied. Thirdly, although there was insufficient replacement of the\r\nphosphates taken from the soil, the yield of wheat was so low that the\r\namount of phosphoric acid removed was small, and the system was\r\npermanent for all practical purposes. One of the facts given in\r\nsubstantiation of this view is that the yield after enclosure\r\nincreased considerably.[40]\r\n\r\nIn discussing these points, it will be well to begin with the evidence\r\nas to exhaustion afforded by the increased yield under enclosure. The\r\nimprovement in yield took place because of the long period of fallow\r\nobtained when the land was used as pasture; or, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, with the increase in nitrogenous organic matter made possible\r\nwhen hay and turnips were introduced as field forage crops. That is,\r\nthe increase in yield depended either upon that prolonged period of\r\nrecuperation which will _restore fertility_, or upon an actual\r\nincrease in the amount of manure used. Apparently, then, open-field\r\nland had become exhausted, since an increase in yield could be\r\nobtained by giving it a rest, without improving the methods of\r\ncultivation, etc., or by adding more manure.\r\n\r\nThere was not, as Dr. Russell supposes, enough manure under the\r\nmedieval system of husbandry to maintain the fertility of the soil. It\r\nis true that the husbandman understood the value of manure, and took\r\ncare that the land should receive as much as possible, and that he\r\nknew also of the value of lime and marl. But, as Dr. Simkhovitch says:\r\n\r\n     It is not within our province to go into agrotechnical details\r\n     and describe what the medieval farmer knew, but seldom practiced\r\n     for lack of time and poor means of communication, in the way of\r\n     liming sour clay ground, etc. Plant production is determined by\r\n     the one of the necessary elements that is available in the least\r\n     quantity. It is a matter of record that the medieval farmer had\r\n     not enough and could not have quite enough manure, to maintain\r\n     the productivity of the soil.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the means of maintaining and increasing the\r\nproductivity of the soil is one thing, but the ability to use this\r\nknowledge is another. The very origin and persistence of the\r\ncumbersome common-field system in so many parts of the world is\r\nsufficient testimony as to the impossibility of improving the quality\r\nof the soil in the Middle Ages. The only way in which these men could\r\ndivide the land into portions of equal value was to divide it first\r\ninto plots of different qualities and then to give a share in each of\r\nthese plots to each member of the community. They never dreamed of\r\nbeing able to bring the poor plots up to a high level of productivity\r\nby the use of plentiful manuring, etc., but had to accept the\r\ndifferences in quality as they found them. The inconvenience and\r\nconfusion of the common-field system were endured because, under the\r\ncircumstances, it was the only possible system.\r\n\r\nVery few cattle were kept. No more were kept because there was no way\r\nof keeping them. In the fields wheat, rye, oats, barley and beans were\r\nraised, but no hay and no turnips. Field grasses and clover which\r\ncould be introduced in the course of field crops were unknown. What\r\nhay they had came entirely from the permanent meadows, the low-lying\r\nland bordering the banks of streams. \"Meadow grass,\" writes Dr.\r\nSimkhovitch, \"could grow only in very definite places on low and moist\r\nland that followed as a rule the course of a stream. This gave the\r\nmeadow a monopolistic value, which it lost after the introduction of\r\ngrass and clover in the rotation of crops.\"[42] The number of cattle\r\nand sheep kept by the community was limited by the amount of forage\r\navailable for winter feeding. Often no limitation upon the number\r\npastured in summer in the common pastures was necessary other than\r\nthat no man should exceed the number which he was able to keep during\r\nthe winter. The meadow hay was supplemented by such poor fodder as\r\nstraw and the loppings of trees, and the cattle were got through the\r\nwinter with the smallest amount of forage which would keep them alive,\r\nbut even with this economy it was impossible to keep a sufficient\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe amount of stall manure produced in the winter was of course small,\r\non account of the scant feed, and even the more plentiful manure of\r\nthe summer months was the property of the lord, so that the villain\r\nholdings received practically no dung. The villains were required to\r\nsend their cattle and sheep at night to a fold which was moved at\r\nfrequent intervals over the demesne land, and their own land received\r\nordinarily no dressing of manure excepting the scant amount produced\r\nwhen the village flocks pastured on the fallow fields.\r\n\r\nThe supply of manure, insufficient in any case to maintain the\r\nfertility of the arable land, was diminishing rather than increasing.\r\nAs Dr. Russell suggested in the passage referred to above, the\r\ncontinuous use of pastures and meadows causes a deterioration in their\r\nquality. The quantity of fodder was decreasing for this reason, almost\r\nimperceptibly, but none the less seriously. Fewer cattle could be kept\r\nas the grass land deteriorated, and the small quantity of manure which\r\nwas available for restoring the productivity of the open fields was\r\ngradually decreasing for this reason.\r\n\r\nSoil exhaustion went on during the Middle Ages not because the\r\ncultivators were careless or ignorant of the fact that manure is\r\nneeded to maintain fertility, but because this means of improving the\r\nsoil was not within their reach. They used what manure they had and\r\nmarled the soil when they had the time and could afford it, but, as\r\nthe centuries passed, the virgin richness of the soil was exhausted\r\nand crops diminished.\r\n\r\nThe only crops which are a matter of statistical record are those\r\nraised on the demesne land of those manors managed for their owners by\r\nbailiffs who made reports of the number of acres sown and the size of\r\nthe harvest. These crops were probably greater than those reaped from\r\naverage land, as it is reasonable to suppose that the demesne land was\r\nsuperior to that held by villains in the first place, and as it\r\nreceived better care, having the benefit of the sheep fold and of such\r\nstall manure as could be collected. Even if it were possible to form\r\nan accurate estimate of the average yield of demesne land, then, we\r\nshould have an over-estimate for the average yield of ordinary\r\ncommon-field land. No accurate estimate of the average yield even of\r\ndemesne land can be made, however, on the basis of the few entries\r\nregarding the yield of land which have been printed. Variations in\r\nyield from season to season and from manor to manor in the same season\r\nare so great that nothing can be inferred as to the general average in\r\nany one season, nor as to the comparative productivity in different\r\nperiods, from the materials at hand. For instance, at Downton, one of\r\nthe Winchester manors, the average yield of wheat between 1346 and\r\n1353 was 6.5 bushels per acre, but this average includes a yield of\r\n3.5 bushels in 1347 and one of 14 bushels in 1352,[43] showing that no\r\nsingle year gives a fair indication of the average yield of the\r\nperiod. For the most part the data available apply to areas too small\r\nand to periods too brief to give more than the general impression that\r\nthe yield of land was very low.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century Walter of Henley and the writer of the\r\nanonymous _Husbandry_ are authorities for the opinion that the average\r\nyield of wheat land should be about ten bushels per acre.[44] At\r\nCombe, Oxfordshire, about the middle of the century, the average yield\r\nduring several seasons was only 5 bushels.[45] About 1300, the fifty\r\nacres of demesne planted with wheat at Forncett yielded about\r\nfive-fold or 10 bushels an acre (five seasons).[46] Between 1330 and\r\n1340, the average yield (500 acres for three seasons), at ten manors\r\nof the Merton College estates was also 10 bushels.[47] At Hawsted,\r\nwhere about 60 acres annually were sown with wheat, the average yield\r\nfor three seasons at the end of the fourteenth century was a little\r\nmore than 7-1/2 bushels an acre.[48]\r\n\r\nStatistical data so scattered as this cannot be used as the basis of\r\nan inquiry into the rate of soil exhaustion. Where the normal\r\nvariation from place to place and from season to season is as great as\r\nit is in agriculture, the material from which averages are constructed\r\nmust be unusually extensive. So far as I know, no material in this\r\nfield entirely satisfactory for statistical purposes is accessible at\r\nthe present time. There is, however, one manor, Witney, for which\r\nimportant data for as many as eighteen seasons between 1200 and 1400\r\nhave been printed. A second suggestive source of information is Gras's\r\ntable of harvest statistics for the whole Winchester group of manors,\r\ncovering three different seasons, separated from each other by\r\nintervals of about a century. The acreage reported for the Winchester\r\nmanors is so extensive that the average yield of the group can be\r\nfairly taken to be the average for all of that part of England.\r\nMoreover, Witney seems to be representative of the Winchester group,\r\nif the fact that the yield at Witney is close to the group average in\r\nthe years when this is known can be relied upon as an indication of\r\nits representativeness in the years when the group average is not\r\nknown. The average yield for all the manors in 1208-1209 was 4-1/3\r\nbushels per acre; for Witney alone, 3-2/3. In 1396-1397 the yield of\r\nthe group and the yield at Witney are, respectively, 6 and 6-1/4\r\nbushels per acre.[49]\r\n\r\nTable III shows the yield of wheat on the manors of the Bishopric of\r\nWinchester in the years 1209, 1300 and 1397. If it could be shown that\r\nthese were representative years, we should have a means of measuring\r\nthe increase or decrease in productivity in these two centuries. Some\r\nindication of the representativeness of the years 1300 and 1397 is\r\ngiven by a comparison of prices for these years with the average\r\nprices of the period in which they lie. The price in 1300 was about 17\r\nper cent below the average for the period 1291-1310,[50] an indication\r\nthat the crop of nine bushels per acre reaped in 1299-1300 was above\r\nthe normal. The price of wheat in 1397 was very slightly above the\r\naverage for the period;[51] six bushels an acre or more, then, was\r\nprobably a normal crop at the end of the fourteenth century. This\r\nconclusion is supported also by the fact that the yield in that year\r\nat Witney was approximately the same as the average of the eleven\r\nseasons between 1340 and 1354 noted in Table V. The price of wheat in\r\nthe year 1209-1210 is not ascertainable. Walter of Henley's statement\r\nthat the price of corn must be higher than the average to prevent loss\r\nwhen the return for seed sown was only three-fold[52] is an\r\nindication that the normal yield must have been at this time at least\r\nthree-fold, or six bushels, so that the extremely low yield of the\r\nyear 1208-1209 can hardly be considered typical. This examination of\r\nthe yield in the three seasons shown in the table gives these results:\r\nat the beginning of the thirteenth century the average yield was\r\nprobably about six bushels and certainly not more than ten; at the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century the average was less than nine\r\nbushels--how much less, whether more or less than six bushels, is not\r\nknown--at the end of the fourteenth century the yield was about six\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE III\r\n\r\n    YIELD OF WHEAT ON THE MANORS OF THE BISHIPRIC OF WINCHESTER[53]\r\n\r\n                  _Area sown_         _Produce_          _Ratio produce_\r\n    _Date_          _Acres_       _Bushels per acre_        _to seed_\r\n\r\n    1208-1209        6838               4-1/3                 2-1/3\r\n    1299-1300        3353               9[54]                 4\r\n    1396-1397        2366-1/2           6                     3\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE IV\r\n\r\n    ACERAGE PLANTED WITH GRAINS ON THE MANOR OF THE BISHOPRIC OF\r\n                      WINCHESTER[55]\r\n\r\n               _Wheat_       _Mancorn and Rye_        _Barley_\r\n    1208-1209    5108               492                 1500\r\n    1299-1300    2410               175                  800\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE V\r\n\r\n    YIELD OF WHEAT AT WITNEY[56]\r\n\r\n    _Date_       _Bushels per acre_         _Acres sown_\r\n    1209               3-2/3                     417\r\n    1277               8-1/2                     180\r\n    1278               ...                       191\r\n    1283               8-1/2                     ...\r\n    1284              10-1/2                     ...\r\n    1285               7-1/4                     ...\r\n    1300              (7-10)                     ...\r\n    1340               5-1/2                     126\r\n    1341               7-1/2                     138\r\n    1342               6                         132\r\n    1344               ...                       129\r\n    1346               5-1/2                     127\r\n    1347               6-1/2                     128\r\n    1348               6-3/4                     138\r\n    1349               4-3/4                     128\r\n    1350               5-1/4                     ...\r\n    1351               6-1/2                     ...\r\n    1352               8-1/2                     ...\r\n    1353               5                         ...\r\n    1397               6-1/4                      51-1/2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yield of the soil in single seasons at widely separated intervals\r\nis a piece of information of little value for our purpose. These\r\ntables reveal other facts of greater significance. The yield for the\r\nyear gives almost no information about the normal yield over a series\r\nof years, but the area planted depends very largely upon that yield.\r\nThe farmer knows that it will pay, on the average, to sow a certain\r\nnumber of acres, and the area under cultivation is not subject to\r\nviolent fluctuations, as is the crop reaped. The area sown in any\r\nseason is representative of the period; the crop reaped may or may\r\nnot be representative. Land which, over a series of years, fails to\r\nproduce enough to pay for cultivation is no longer planted. If the\r\nfertility of the soil is declining, this is shown by the gradual\r\nwithdrawal from cultivation of the less productive land, as it is\r\nrealized that it produces so little that it no longer pays to till it.\r\nTable IV shows that in fact this withdrawal of worn out land from\r\ncultivation was actually taking place. The area sown with wheat on the\r\ntwenty-five manors for which the statistics for both periods are\r\navailable was reduced by more than fifty per cent between the\r\nbeginning and the end of the thirteenth century. A similar reduction\r\nin the area planted with all of the other crops, mancorn, rye, barley\r\nand oats, took place. A process of selection was going on which\r\neliminated the less fertile land from cultivation. If six bushels an\r\nacre was necessary to pay the costs of tillage, land which returned\r\nless than six bushels could not be kept under the plow. The six bushel\r\ncrop which seems to be normal in the fourteenth century is not the\r\naverage yield of all of that land which had been under cultivation at\r\nan earlier time, but only of the better grades of land. Plots which\r\nhad formerly yielded their five or six bushels an acre had become too\r\nbarren to produce the bare minimum which made tillage profitable, and\r\ntheir produce no longer appeared in the average. Even with the\r\nelimination of the worst grades of land the average yield fell,\r\nbecause the better land, too, was becoming less fertile. At Witney\r\n(Table V) the area planted with wheat fell from about 180 acres in\r\n1277 to less than 140 acres in 1340; but, in spite of this reduction\r\nin the amount of land cultivated, the average annual yield after 1340\r\nwas less than 6-1/2 bushels, while it had been about 8-1/2 bushels per\r\nacre in the period 1277-1285. This withdrawal of land from cultivation\r\ntook place without the occurrence of any such calamity as the Black\r\nDeath, which is ordinarily mentioned as the cause of the reduction of\r\narable land to pasture in so far as this took place before 1400. It\r\naffords an indirect proof of the fact that much land was becoming\r\nbarren.\r\n\r\nThese statistical indications of declining productivity of the soil\r\nare supported by the overwhelming evidence of the poverty of the\r\nfourteenth century peasantry--poverty which can be explained only by\r\nthe barrenness of their land. Many of the features of the agrarian\r\nchanges of this period are familiar--the substitution of money\r\npayments for villain services, the frequency of desertion, the\r\namalgamation and leasing of bond-holdings, the subdividing and\r\nleasing of the demesne. A point which has not been dwelt upon is the\r\nfavorable pecuniary terms upon which the villains commuted their\r\nservices. Where customary relations were replaced by a new bargain,\r\nthe bargain was always in favor of the tenant. What was the source of\r\nthis strategic advantage of the villain? The great number of holdings\r\nmade vacant by the Black Death and the scarcity of eligible holders\r\nplaced the landowner at a disadvantage, but this situation was\r\ntemporary. How can the difficulty of filling vacant tenements before\r\nthe Black Death be accounted for, and why were villains still able to\r\nsecure reductions in their rents a generation after its effects had\r\nceased to be felt?\r\n\r\nEven before the Black Death, it was frequently the case that villain\r\nholdings could be filled only by compulsion. The difficulty in finding\r\ntenants did not originate in the decrease in the population caused by\r\nthe pestilence. There is little evidence that there was a lack of men\r\nqualified to hold land even after the Black Death, but it is certain\r\nthat they sought in every way possible to avoid land-holding. The\r\nvillains who were eligible in many cases fled, so that it became\r\nexceedingly difficult to fill a tenement when once it became vacant.\r\nLand whose holders died of the pestilence was still without tenants\r\ntwenty-five and thirty years later, although persistent attempts had\r\nbeen made to force men to take it up. When compulsion succeeded only\r\nin driving men away from the manor, numerous concessions were made in\r\nthe attempt to make land-holding more attractive. It is important to\r\nnotice that these concessions were economic, not social. The force\r\nwhich was driving men away was not the desire to escape the incidents\r\nof serfdom, but the impossibility of making a living from holdings\r\nburdened with heavy rents. These burdens were eased, grudgingly,\r\nlittle by little, by landlords who had exhausted other methods of\r\nkeeping their land from being deserted. It was necessary to reduce\r\nthe rent in some way in order to permit the villains to live. The\r\nproduce of a customary holding was no longer sufficient to maintain\r\nlife and to allow the holder to render the services and pay the rent\r\nwhich had been fixed in an earlier century when the soil was more\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nNotices of vacated holdings date from before 1220 on the estates of\r\nthe Berkeleys. Thomas the First was lord of Berkeley between 1220 and\r\n1243, and\r\n\r\n     Such were the tymes for the most part whilest this Lord Thomas\r\n     sate Lord, That many of his Tenants in divers of his manors ...\r\n     surrendred up and least their lands into his hands because they\r\n     were not able to pay the rent and doe the services, which also\r\n     often happened in the tyme of his elder brother the Lord\r\n     Robert.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis entry in the chronicle is significant, for it is typical of\r\nconditions on many other manors at a later date. The tenants were not\r\nable to pay the rent and do the services, and therefore gave up the\r\nland. It was leased, when men could be found to take it at all, at a\r\nrent lower than that which its former holders had found so oppressive.\r\nIt is interesting to note that much of this land was soon after\r\nenclosed and converted to pasture, more than a century before the\r\nevent which is supposed to mark the beginning of the enclosure\r\nmovement. The productivity of the land had declined; its holders were\r\nno longer able to pay the customary rent, and the lord had to content\r\nhimself with lower rents; the productivity was so low in some cases\r\nthat the land was fit only for sheep pasture.\r\n\r\nLand holding was regarded as a misfortune in the fourteenth century.\r\nThe decline in fertility had made it impossible for a villain to\r\nsupport himself and his family and perform the accustomed services and\r\npay the rent for his land. Sometimes heirs were excused on account of\r\ntheir poverty. Page has made note of the prevailing custom of fining\r\nthese heirs for the privilege of refusing the land:\r\n\r\n     In 1340 J. F., who held a messuage and half a virgate, had to pay\r\n     two shillings for permission to give up the land, because he was\r\n     unable to render the services due from it. Three other men at the\r\n     same time paid six pence each not to be compelled to take up\r\n     customary land ... at Woolston, 1340, R. G. gave up his messuage\r\n     and half virgate because he could not render the necessary\r\n     services; whereupon T. S. had to pay three shillings three pence\r\n     that he might not be forced to take the holding, and another\r\n     villain paid six shillings eight pence for the same thing.[58]\r\n\r\nMiss Levett mentions the fact that cases were fairly frequent at the\r\nWinchester manors in the fourteenth century where a widow or next of\r\nkin refused to take up land on account of poverty or impotence;[59]\r\nand three villains of Forncett gave up their holdings before 1350 on\r\naccount of their poverty.[60]\r\n\r\nIn case no one could be found who would willingly take up the land,\r\nthe method of compulsion was tried. The responsibility for providing a\r\ntenant in these cases seems to have been shifted to the whole\r\ncommunity. A villain chosen by the whole homage had to take up the\r\nland. At Crawley in 1315 there were two such cases. A fine was paid by\r\none villain for a cottage and ten acres \"_que devenerunt in manus\r\ndomini tanquam escheata pro defectu tenentium & ad que eligebatur per\r\ntotam decenuam_.\" At Twyford in 13433-1344, J. paid a fine for a\r\nmessuage and a half virgate of land, \"_ad que idem Johannes electus\r\nest per totum homagium_.\"[61] In other entries cited by Page, the\r\nelement of compulsion is unmistakable: the new holder of land is\r\ndescribed as \"_electus per totum homagium ad hoc compulsus_,\" a phrase\r\nwhich is frequently found also in the entries of fines paid on some of\r\nthe Winchester manors after the Black Death.[62]\r\n\r\nThis method of compulsion was useful to some extent, but there were\r\nlimits beyond which it could not be pushed. Five men of Therfield in\r\n1351 were ordered to take up customary land, and several of them left\r\nthe manor rather than obey. \"_Vendiderunt quod habuerunt et\r\nrecesserunt nocitante._\"[63] At Nailesbourne, in the same year,\r\n\"_Robertus le Semenour compulsus finivit et clam recessit et ea tenere\r\nrecusavit_.\"[64] The problem which confronted landowners during the\r\nBlack Death was not so much an absolute lack of men on the manors, as\r\na stubborn unwillingness on the part of these men to hold land. There\r\nwere enough men left by the pestilence, but they were determined to\r\navoid taking up the tenements whose holders had died. The pressure\r\nwhich was brought upon the villains to induce them to take up land and\r\nto prevent them from leaving the manor could not prevent the\r\ndesertions, which had begun before the pestilence, and which took away\r\nthe men who would naturally have supplied the places of those who\r\ndied. The whole village must have been anxious to prevent the\r\ndesertion of these men, for the community was held responsible for the\r\nservices from vacant tenements, when they failed to provide a tenant.\r\nAt Meon, for instance, each of twenty-six tenants paid 1 _d._ in\r\nplace of works due from a vacant holding, according to an arrangement\r\nwhich had been made before the Black Death,[65] and at Burwell, in\r\n1350, when three villains left the manor, their land was \"_tradita\r\ntoto homagio ad faciendum servicia et consuetudines_.\"[66] In spite of\r\nthe deterring force which must have been exerted by public opinion\r\nunder these conditions, and in spite of the aggressive measures taken\r\nby bailiffs to prevent desertion and to recapture those who had fled,\r\nthe records are full of the names of those who had been successful in\r\nmaking their escape. Throughout the latter half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury and the first part of the fifteenth there was a gradual\r\nleakage from the Winchester manors. \"Villeins were apt 'to go away\r\nsecretly' and to be no more found.\"[67] Page describes a similar\r\ntendency on the part of villains of the manors whose records he has\r\nexamined. At Weston, three villains deserted in 1354. At Woolston in\r\n1357 a serf \"_recessit a dominio et dereliquit terram suam_.\" At\r\nChilton, between 1356 and 1359, eleven men and two women fled, some of\r\nwhom were recaptured. At Therfield in 1369 a man who held twenty-three\r\nacres of land fled with his whole family. In the same year at Abbot's\r\nRipton a man escaped with his horses, and three years later another\r\nvillain left Weston by night.[68] At Forncett, \"Before 1378 from 60 to\r\n70 tenements had fallen into the lord's hands. It was the serfs\r\nespecially who were relinquishing their land; for a larger proportion\r\nof the tenements charged with week-work were abandoned than of the\r\nmore lightly burdened tenements.\"[69] This, of course, is what we should\r\nexpect, as the lighter burdens of these holdings caused their tenants to\r\nfeel less severely than the ordinary serfs the declining productivity of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe method of compulsion failed to keep the tenants on the land. They\r\nran off, and the holdings remained vacant. It was necessary to make\r\nconcessions of a material nature in order to persuade men to take up\r\nland or to keep what they had. They were excused of a part of their\r\nservices in some cases, and in others all of the services were\r\ndefinitely commuted for small sums of money. When no tenants for\r\nvacant land could be secured who would perform the customary services\r\ndue from it, the bailiff was forced to commute them. \"'So and so holds\r\nsuch land for rent, because no one would hold it for works,' is a\r\nfairly frequent entry both before and after 1349,\" on the records of\r\nthe Bishopric of Winchester. The important point to be noticed here is\r\nthat the money rent paid in these cases was always less than the value\r\nof the services which had formerly been exacted from the land; not\r\nonly that, it was less than the money equivalent for which those\r\nservices had sometimes been commuted, an amount far less than the\r\nmarket value of the services in the fourteenth century at the\r\nprevailing rates of wages. For instance, when Roger Haywood took up\r\nthree virgates and a cotland at a money rent instead of for the\r\ntraditional services, \"_quia nullus tenere voluit_,\" he contracted to\r\npay rents whose total sum amounted to less than twenty-five shillings\r\nand included the church scot for one virgate and the cotland. On this\r\nmanor, Sutton, the total services of _one_ virgate valued at the rate\r\nat which they were ordinarily \"sold\" must have amounted to at least\r\neighteen or twenty shillings. At Wargrave the services of thirty-two\r\nvirgates were all commuted at three shillings each, and the same sum\r\nwas paid by each of twenty-three virgates at Waltham.[70]\r\n\r\nAt Forncett and on the manors of the Berkeley estates commutation had\r\nlittle part in the disappearance of labor dues. The vacated land was\r\nleased in larger or smaller parcels at the best rents which could be\r\nobtained. This rent bore no relation to the value of the services\r\nformerly due from the land. The customary tenements which had been the\r\nunits upon which labor dues were assessed were broken up, and the\r\nacres leased separately, or in new combinations, to other men.[71] At\r\nForncett, as in the case of the Winchester manors where the services\r\nwere commuted, the terms of the new arrangement can be compared with\r\nthose of the old, and it is seen that the money rent obtained was less\r\nthan the value of the services formerly due. The customary services\r\nwere here valued at over two shillings per acre; the average rent\r\nobtained was less than one shilling an acre. The net pecuniary result\r\nof the change, then, was the same as though the services had been\r\ncommuted for money at less than their value.\r\n\r\nAnother method of reducing rents in this period was the remission of a\r\npart of the services due. Miss Levett notes the extent to which this\r\ntook place on the Winchester manors, and suggests that the Bishop\r\nwished to avoid the wastefulness and inefficiency of serf labor.[72]\r\nShe overlooks the fact that he failed to exact the money payment in\r\nplace of the services for which manorial custom provided. It was a\r\nwell established custom that in case work owed by the tenants was not\r\nused they should pay money instead. The amount of work needed each\r\nyear on the demesne varied according to the size of the harvest, etc.,\r\nbut the number of days' works for which the tenants was liable was\r\nfixed. The surplus of works owed above those needed were \"sold\" each\r\nyear to the villains. Frequently the number of works sold exceeded the\r\nnumber performed, although formal commutation of dues had not taken\r\nplace. At Nailesbourne (1348-1349), 4755 works were due from the\r\nvillains, but nearly 4000 of these were sold.[73] If the Bishop had\r\nmerely wished to avoid waste, then, in ceasing to require the\r\nperformance of villain services on his manors, he would have required\r\nthe payment of the money equivalent of these services. When the\r\nservices were excused, and the customary alternative of a money\r\npayment also, the change was clearly an intentional reduction in the\r\nburden of villain tenure. This fact makes emphasis upon the payment of\r\nmoney as the distinguishing feature of the changed relations between\r\nlandlord and tenant in this period misleading. There was every\r\nprecedent for requiring a money payment in the place of services not\r\nwanted. When, therefore, a great many services were simply allowed to\r\nlapse, it is an indication that it was impossible to exact the\r\npayment. It makes little difference whether the services were commuted\r\nat a lower rate than that at which they had formerly been \"sold\" or\r\nwhether the villain was simply held accountable for a smaller number\r\nof services at the old rate; in either case the rent was reduced, and\r\nthe burden of the tenant was less.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of rent is thus the characteristic and fundamental\r\nfeature of all of the changes of land tenure during this period. This\r\nfact is ignored by historians who suppose the chief factor in the\r\ncommutation movement to have been the desire of prosperous villains to\r\nrid themselves of the degrading marks of serfdom. Vinogradoff, for\r\ninstance, in his preface to the monograph from which most of the\r\nforegoing illustrations have been drawn, has nothing at all to say of\r\nthe reduction of rent and the poverty of the tenants when he is\r\nspeaking of the various circumstances attending the introduction of\r\nmoney payments.\r\n\r\n     In the particular case under discussion the cultural policy of\r\n     William of Wykeham may have suggested arrangements in commutation\r\n     of labour services and rents in kind. In other cases similar\r\n     results were connected with war expenditures and town life. In so\r\n     far the initiative in selling services came from the class of\r\n     landowners. But there were powerful tendencies at work in the\r\n     life of the peasants which made for the same result. The most\r\n     comprehensive of these tendencies was connected, it seems to me,\r\n     with the accumulation of capital in the hands of the villains\r\n     under a system of customary dues. When rents and services became\r\n     settled and lost their elasticity, roughly speaking, in the\r\n     course of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, the\r\n     surplus of profits from agriculture was bound to collect in the\r\n     hands of those who received them directly from the soil, and it\r\n     was natural for these first receivers to turn the proceeds\r\n     primarily towards an improvement of their social condition; the\r\n     redemption of irksome services was a conspicuous manifestation of\r\n     this policy.[74]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paragraph contains several suggestions which are shown to be\r\nmisleading by a study of the extracts from the original sources\r\nembodied in the essay of whose preface it forms a part. It is true\r\nthat the cultural policy of William of Wykeham was an extravagant one,\r\nand that he was in need of money when the system of tenure was being\r\nrevolutionized on his estates; but it is misleading to interpret the\r\nchanges which took place as measures for the prompt conversion into\r\ncash of the episcopal revenues. No radical changes in the system of\r\npayment were necessary in order to secure cash, for the system of\r\nselling surplus services to the villains had become established\r\ndecades before the time of this bishop, and no formal commutation of\r\nservices was necessary in order to convert the labor dues of the\r\nvillains into payments in money. The bulk of the services were not\r\nperformed, even before commutation, and the lord received money for\r\nthe services not used on the demesne. The essential feature of the\r\nchanges which took place was a reduction in the amount paid--a\r\nreduction which the bishop must have resisted so far as he dared, just\r\nas other landowners must have resisted the reductions which their\r\ntenants forced them to make at a time when they were in need of money.\r\nThe commutation of services was incidental, and was only a slight\r\nmodification of the system formerly in use, but, whether services were\r\ncommuted or were in part excused, the result was a lessening of the\r\nburden borne by the tenant, and the reduction of the rent received by\r\nthe lord.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as Professor Vinogradoff states, that there were powerful\r\ntendencies in the life of the peasants which made for this result. In\r\nfact no initiative in selling services--at these rates--could have\r\ncome from the side of the landowners. The change was forced upon them.\r\nUnless they compromised with their tenants and reduced their rents\r\nthey soon found vacant tenements on their hands which no one could be\r\ncompelled to take. The amount of land which was finally leased at low\r\nrents because the former holders had died or run away and no one could\r\nbe forced to take it at the old rents is evidence of the reluctance\r\nwith which landowners accepted the situation and of their inability to\r\nresist the change in the end.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true that the most comprehensive of these tendencies was\r\nthe accumulation of capital in the hands of the villains, and their\r\ndesire to improve their social condition. The immediate affect of the\r\ncommutation of services and similar changes at this time was to leave\r\ntheir social condition untouched, whatever the final result may have\r\nbeen. These villains did not buy themselves free of the marks of\r\nservitude. Their gradual emancipation came for other reasons. At\r\nWitney, for example, where the works of all the native tenants had\r\nbeen commuted by 1376, they were still required to perform duties of a\r\nservile character:\r\n\r\n     they were all to join in haymaking and in washing and shearing\r\n     the lord's sheep, to pay pannage for their pigs, to take their\r\n     turn of service as reeve and tithingman, and to carry the lord's\r\n     victuals and baggage on his departure from Witney as the natives\r\n     were formerly wont to do.[75]\r\n\r\nThis example, taken at random, is typical of the continuance of\r\nconditions which should make the historian hesitate before adopting\r\nthe view that the social condition of the peasants was improved by the\r\nnew arrangements made as to the bulk of their services and rents. But\r\nmore than that, the terms of the new arrangements are not those which\r\nwould be offered by well-to-do cultivators in whose hands the profits\r\nfrom the soil had accumulated. In all of these cases the new terms\r\nwere advantageous to the tenants, not to the lord, and advantageous in\r\na strictly pecuniary way. The lord had to grant these terms because\r\nthe tenants were in the most miserable poverty, and could no longer\r\npay their accustomed rent.\r\n\r\nNeither the Black Death, whose effects were evanescent, nor the desire\r\nof prosperous villains to free themselves of the degrading marks of\r\nserfdom was an important cause in the sequence of agrarian changes\r\nwhich took place in the fourteenth century. Serfdom as a status was\r\nhardly affected, but a thousand entries record the poverty and\r\ndestitution which made it necessary to lighten the economic burdens of\r\nthe serfs. At Brightwell, for example, the works of three\r\nhalf-virgaters were relaxed, the record reads, because of their\r\npoverty (1349-1350).[76] Some villains had no oxen, and were excused\r\ntheir plowing on this account, or were allowed to substitute manual\r\nlabor for carting services.[77] At Weston, in 1370, a tenant \"_non\r\narat terram domini causa paupertate_.\"[78] At Downton, in 13766-1377,\r\nno money could be collected from the villains in place of the services\r\nthey owed in haymaking.[79] Frequently when services were commuted for\r\nmoney, the record of the fact is accompanied by the statement that the\r\nchange was made on account of the poverty of the tenants. At Witney,\r\nfor instance, the\r\n\r\n     works and services of all the native tenants were commuted at\r\n     fixed payments (_ad certos denarios_) by favour of the lord as\r\n     long as the lord pleases, on account of the poverty of the\r\n     homage.[80]\r\n\r\nThe reduction in rent in this case was at least a third of the total.\r\nThe value of the customary services commuted was at least ten\r\nshillings six pence per acre, and they were commuted at six shillings\r\neight pence. Other explicit references to the poverty of the tenants\r\nas the cause of commutation are quoted by Page:\r\n\r\n     At Hinton, Berks, the Bailiff reports in 1377, that the former\r\n     lord before his death had commuted the services of the villains\r\n     for money, \"eo quod customarii impotentes ad facienda dicta opera\r\n     et pro eorum paupertate\" ... At Stevenage, 1354, S. G. \"tenuit\r\n     unam vergatam reddendo inde per annum in serviciis et\r\n     consuetudinibus xxii solidos. Et dictus S. G. pauper et impotens\r\n     dictam virgatam tenere. Ideo concessum est per dominum quod S. G.\r\n     habeat et teneat predictam terram reddendo inde xiii solidos iv\r\n     denarios pro omnibus serviciis et consuetudinibus.\"[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the matter of heriots, also, evidences of extreme\r\npoverty are frequent. Frequently when a tenant died there was no beast\r\nfor the lord to seize.\r\n\r\n     The heriot of a virgate was generally an ox, or money payment of\r\n     its value. But the amount as often reduced \"propter paupertatem,\"\r\n     and sometimes when a succeeding tenant could not pay, a half acre\r\n     was deducted from the virgate and held by the lord instead of the\r\n     heriot.[82]\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the value of these holdings declined when their\r\ntenants possessed too few cattle was rapid. Land without stock is\r\nworthless. The temptation to sell an ox in order to meet the rent was\r\ngreat, but when the deficiency was due to declining productivity of\r\nthe soil, there was no probability that it would be made up the\r\nfollowing year even with all the stock, and with fewer cattle the\r\nsituation was hopeless. After this process had gone on for a few years\r\nnothing was left, not even a yoke of oxen for plowing. Whatever means\r\nhad been taken to keep up the fertility of the land, attend to the\r\ndrainage, _etc._, were of necessity neglected, and finally the hope of\r\nkeeping up the struggle was abandoned. The spirit which prompted the\r\nreply of the Chatteris tenant when he was ordered by the manorial\r\ncourt to put his holding in repair can be understood: \"_Non reparavit\r\ntenementum, et dicit quod non vult reparare sed potius dimittere et\r\nabire._\"[83] If he left the manor and joined the other men who under\r\nthe same circumstances were giving up their land and becoming\r\nfugitives, it was not with the hope of greatly improving his\r\ncondition. Some of the fugitives found employment in the towns, but\r\nthis was by no means certain, and the records frequently state that\r\nthe absent villains had become beggars.[84]\r\n\r\nThe declining productivity of the soil not only affected the villains,\r\nbut reduced the profits of demesne cultivation. It has already been\r\nseen that the acreage under crop was steadily decreasing, as more and\r\nmore land reached a stage of barrenness in which it no longer repaid\r\ncultivation. This process is seen from another angle in the frequent\r\ncomplaints that the customary meals supplied by the lord to serfs\r\nworking on the demesne cost more than the labor was worth. According\r\nto Miss Levett:\r\n\r\n     This complaint was made on many manors belonging to the Bishop of\r\n     Winchester in spite of the fact that if one may judge from the\r\n     cost of the \"Autumn Works\" the meals were not very lavish, the\r\n     average cost being 1 _d._ or 1-1/4 _d._ per head for each\r\n     _Precaria_.... The complaint that the system was working at a\r\n     loss comes also from Brightwaltham (Berkshire), Hutton (Essex),\r\n     and from Banstead (Surrey), as early as 1325, and is reflected in\r\n     contemporary literature. \"The work is not worth the breakfast\"\r\n     (or the _reprisa_) occurs several times in the Winchester Pipe\r\n     Rolls.... By 1376 the entry is considerably more frequent, and\r\n     applies to ploughing as well as to harvest-work.[85] At Meon 64\r\n     acres of ploughing were excused _quia non fecerunt huiusmodi\r\n     arrura causa reprisae_. A similar note occurs at Hambledon\r\n     (_Ecclesia_) and at Fareham with the further information that the\r\n     ploughing was there performed _ad cibum domini_. At Overton four\r\n     virgates were excused their ploughing _quia reprisa excedit\r\n     valorem_.[86]\r\n\r\nMiss Levett quotes these entries as an explanation for the tendency to\r\nexcuse services, forgetting that the lord could usually demand a money\r\nequivalent for services not required for any reason. We have here the\r\nreason why so few services are demanded, but no explanation of the\r\nfailure to require money instead. The fundamental cause of the\r\nworthlessness of the labor on the demesne is the fact which accounts\r\nfor the absence of a money payment for the work not performed. The\r\ndemesne land was worn out, and did not repay costs of cultivation; the\r\nbond land was worn out, and the villains were too poor to \"buy\" their\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe profits of cultivating this unproductive land were so small that a\r\ndeficit arose when it was necessary to meet the cost of maintaining\r\nfor a few days the men employed on it. It is not surprising that men\r\nwho had families to support and were trying to make a living from the\r\nsoil abandoned their worthless holdings and left the manor. The lord\r\nhad only to meet the expense of food for the laborers during the few\r\ndays when they were actually at work plowing the demesne or harvesting\r\nthe crop. How could the villain support his whole family during the\r\nentire year on the produce of worse land more scantily manured? In\r\nthis low productivity of the land is to be found the reason for the\r\nconversion of much of the demesne into pasture land, as soon as the\r\nsupply of servile labor failed. It was, of course, impossible to pay\r\nthe wages of free men from the produce of soil too exhausted to repay\r\neven the slight cost incidental to cultivating it with serf labor.\r\nThe bailiffs complained of the exorbitant wages demanded by servants\r\nin husbandry; these wages were exorbitant only because the produce of\r\nthe land was so small that it was not worth the pains of tillage.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the many causes which were at work to undermine\r\nthe manorial system in the fourteenth century is, therefore, plain.\r\nThe productivity of the soil had declined to a point where villain\r\nholdings would no longer support the families which cultivated them\r\nand where demesne land was sometimes not worth cultivation even by\r\nserf labor. Under these conditions, the very basis of the manor was\r\ndestroyed. The poverty of the peasants, the difficulty with which\r\ntenants could be found for vacant holdings, even though the greatest\r\npressure was brought to bear upon eligible villains, and even though\r\nthe servile burdens were considerably reduced, and the frequency with\r\nwhich these serfs preferred the uncertainty and risk of deserting to\r\nthe certain destitution and misery of land-holding, are facts which\r\nare intimately connected, and which are all due to the same cause. It\r\nhad been impossible to maintain the productive capacity of the land at\r\na level high enough to provide a living for the tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[39] E. J.

The acreage planted is\r\nobviously understated, and it is possible to make only a rough\r\nestimate of the correct acreage. The acceptance of the area given by\r\nGras (82 acres) results in the conclusion that 22 bushels per acre was\r\nreaped. The suspicion that this result must be incorrect is confirmed\r\nwhen it is found, also, that 68-1/4 quarters of seed were sown--an\r\namount sufficient for 270 acres at the average rate of 2 bushels per\r\nacre, or for 220 acres at the rate of 2-1/2 bushels per acre, which\r\nBallard gives as the rate usual at Witney. (Levett and Ballard, _op.\r\ncit._, p. 192.) In 1277 the acreage sown with wheat at Witney was 180\r\nacres, and in 1278, 191. (_Ibid._, p. 190.) If 3 bushels per acre were\r\nsown in 1299, the area in this year also was 180 acres. If these\r\nestimates are used instead of the figure 82, as indicating the correct\r\nacreage, the yield for the year is found to be between 7 and 10\r\nbushels per acre, in a season in which the average yield for the whole\r\ngroup of manors was 9 bushels per acre. The figures at Witney in the\r\nthree seasons where a comparison with the general average for the\r\ngroup is possible deviate from it within limits narrow enough to\r\nindicate that conditions at Witney were roughly typical.\r\n\r\n[50] Rogers, _History of Agriculture and Prices_, vol. i, p. 228.\r\n\r\n[51] _Ibid._, vol. i, p. 234; vol. iv, p. 282.\r\n\r\n[52] _Op. cit._, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[53] Gras, _Evol. of the Eng.

This figure is incorrect, as it is derived by dividing the\r\ntotal produce of 42 manors by the total acreage planted on only 38\r\nmanors. The produce of the four manors on which the acreage planted is\r\nunknown amounts to nearly 750 quarters, a large item in a total of\r\nonly 4527 quarters for the whole group of manors. The ratio of produce\r\nto seed, however, is independent of the number of acres planted, and\r\nthese four manors are included in the computation of this figure.\r\n\r\n[55] Gras, _op. cit._, appendix A.

The economic basis of\r\nserfdom was destroyed; a servile tenement could no longer be depended\r\nupon to supply an able-bodied man to do work on the demesne for\r\nseveral days a week throughout the year, with extra helpers from his\r\nfamily at harvest time. The money received in commutation of customary\r\nlabor, or as rent from land which had formerly been held for services\r\nwas far less than the value of the services, and would not pay the\r\nwages of free men hired in place of the serfs who had formerly\r\nperformed the labor. Moreover, the demesne land itself was for the\r\nmost part so unproductive that it had hardly paid to cultivate it even\r\nat the slight expense incurred in furnishing food for the serfs\r\nemployed; it was all the more a waste of money to hire men to plow it\r\nand sow it.\r\n\r\nThe text books on economic history usually give a careful account of\r\nthe various forms of leases which were used as bailiff-farming was\r\nabandoned. We are told how the demesne was leased either as a whole or\r\nin larger or smaller pieces to different tenants and sets of tenants,\r\nfor lives, for longer or shorter periods of years, with or without the\r\nstock which was on it, and, in some cases, with the servile labor of\r\nsome of the villains, when this had not all been excused or commuted\r\ninto money payments. Arrangements necessarily differed on the\r\ndifferent manors, and the exact terms of these first experimental\r\nleases do not concern us here.\r\n\r\nThe fact which does interest us is that with the cessation of bailiff\r\nfarming the last attempt at keeping the land distributed in fairly\r\nequal shares among a large number of tenants was abandoned. Bond land\r\nhad been divided into portions which were each supposed to be\r\nsufficient for the maintenance of a laborer and his family. As long as\r\nthe demesne was cultivated for the lord, it was to his interest to\r\nprevent the concentration of holdings in a few hands, unless some\r\ncertain provision could be made to insure the performance of the labor\r\ndue from all of them. But even when the demesne was still being\r\nmanaged for the lord, it had already become necessary in some cases to\r\nallow one man to hold two or more of these portions, for the\r\nproductivity had so declined that one was no longer enough. Now, with\r\nthe leasing of the demesne, the lord no longer had an interest in\r\nmaintaining the working population of the manor at a certain level,\r\nbut was concerned with the problem of getting as much rent as\r\npossible. When the demesne and the vacant bond tenements began to be\r\nleased, the land was given to the highest bidder, and the competitive\r\nsystem was introduced at the start. This led to the gradual\r\naccumulation of large holdings by some tenants, while other men were\r\nstill working very small portions, and others occupied holdings of\r\nevery intermediate size. The uniformity of size characteristic of the\r\nearly virgates disappeared. In this chapter these points will be\r\nconsidered briefly, and a study will also be made of the way in which\r\nthese new holders managed their lands.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as the more destitute villains were giving up\r\ntheir holdings and leaving the manor, and as no one could be found to\r\ntake their places on the old terms, the landlords gave up the policy\r\nof holding the land until someone should be willing to pay the\r\naccustomed services and let the vacant lands at the best rents\r\nobtainable. Freeholders, and villains whose land was but lightly\r\nburdened, and those who by superior management had been able to make\r\nboth ends meet, were now able to increase their holdings by adding a\r\nfew acres of land which had been a part of the demesne or of a vacated\r\nholding. The case of the man at Sutton, who took up three virgates and\r\na cotland, has already been mentioned. Another case of \"engrossing,\"\r\nas it was called, dated from 1347-1348 at Meon, where John Blackman\r\npaid fines for one messuage with ten acres of land, two other\r\nmessuages with a virgate of land each, one parcel of four acres, and\r\nanother holding whose nature is not specified.[87]\r\n\r\nLegislators who observed this tendency issued edicts against it. No\r\nattempt was made to discover the underlying cause of which it was\r\nmerely a symptom. The first agrarian statutes were of a\r\ncharacteristically restrictive nature, and no constructive policy was\r\nattempted by the government until after a century of futile attempts\r\nto deal with the separate evils of engrossing, enclosure, conversion\r\nto pasture, destruction of houses and rural depopulation. The first\r\nremedy these evils suggested was limitation of the amount of land\r\nwhich one man should be allowed to hold.[88] In 1489 the statutes\r\nbegin to prohibit the occupation of more than one farm by the same\r\nman, or to regulate the use of the land so occupied. The statute of\r\n1489 refers to the Isle of Wight, where \"Many dwelling places, fermes,\r\nand fermeholdes have of late tyme ben used to be taken in to oon manys\r\nhold and handes, that of old tyme were wont to be in severall persons\r\nholdes and handes.\"[89] The proclamation of 1514 regulated the use of\r\nland held by all persons who were tenants of more than _one_ farm.[90]\r\nA law of 1533 provides that no person should occupy more than _two_\r\nfarms.[91]\r\n\r\nThe old villain holdings did not necessarily pass intact into the\r\nhands of one holder, but were sometimes divided up and taken by\r\ndifferent men, a few acres at a time. One Richard Grene in 1582 held\r\nlands of which ten and a half acres had been gradually acquired\r\nthrough as many as ten grants. This land had formed part of six other\r\nholdings, and much of the rest of the land belonging to these holdings\r\nhad also been alienated.[92] The Inquisition of 1517 reported numerous\r\ncases of engrossing, and Professor Gay notes some of the entries in\r\nthe returns of the Inquisition of 1607 which are also interesting in\r\nthis connection: W. S. separated six yardlands from a manor house and\r\nput a widow in the house, a laborer in the kitchen and a weaver in the\r\nbarn. The land was divided between two tenants who already had houses,\r\nand presumably, other land, and were taking this opportunity to\r\nenlarge their holdings of land. G. K. took from a farmhouse the land\r\nwhich formed part of the same tenement and leased the house to a\r\nlaborer who had \"but one acre of land in every field.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe growing irregularity of holdings, combined with the decrease in\r\nthe number of holders whose interests had to be consulted, made it\r\neasier than it had formerly been to modify the traditional routine of\r\nhusbandry. Even though the new land acquired by tenants from the\r\ndemesne or from old bond-holdings did not happen to be adjacent to\r\nstrips already in their possession, exchange could accomplish the\r\ndesired result. At Gorleston, Suffolk, a tenant sublet about half of\r\nhis holding to eight persons, and at the same time acquired plots of\r\nland for himself from another eight holdings.[94] Before 1350\r\nexchanges, sales and subletting of land by tenants had become general\r\non the manors of the Bishopric of Winchester. It is unusual to find\r\nmore than two cases of exchanges in any one year, even on a large\r\nmanor; but Miss Levett adds: \"On the other hand, one can hardly look\r\nthrough the fines on any one of the episcopal manors for a period of\r\nten years without finding one or two. From the close correspondence of\r\nthe areas exchanged, together with exact details as to position, it is\r\nfairly clear that the object of the exchange was to obtain more\r\ncompact holdings.\"[95]\r\n\r\nFitzherbert writes that \"By the assente of the Lordes and tenauntes,\r\neuery neyghbour may exchange lands with other.\"[96] This practice was\r\nespecially sanctioned by law in 1597 \"for the more comodious\r\noccupyinge or husbandrie of anye Land, Meadows, or Pastures,\"[97] but\r\nit was common in the open-field villages before the legal permission\r\nwas given. Tawney reproduces several maps belonging to All Souls'\r\nMuniment Room, which show the ownership of certain open-field\r\nholdings of about 1590. Here consolidation of plots had proceeded\r\nnoticeably. There are several plots of considerable size held by a\r\nsingle tenant.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of consolidated holdings are considerable. In the first\r\nplace, the turf boundaries between the strips could be plowed up, or\r\nthe direction of the plowing itself could be changed, if enough strips\r\nwere thrown together. Fitzherbert advises the farmer who has a number\r\nof strips lying side by side and who\r\n\r\n     hath no dung nor shepe to compost nor dung his land withall. Then\r\n     let the husband take his ploughe, and cast al such landes three\r\n     or four tymes togider, and make theyr rigge theyr as ye raine was\r\n     before.... And so shel he finde new moulde, that was not sene in\r\n     an hundred yeres before, the which must nedes gyue more corne\r\n     than the other dydde before.[98]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two Elizabethan surveys examined by Corbett, we have evidence that\r\nthe theoretical advantages urged by Fitzherbert were not unknown in\r\npractice. It is now and then stated that the _metae_ between strips\r\nhave been plowed up. But sometimes, even though all of the strips in a\r\nfurlong had been acquired by the same owner, and enclosed, the land\r\nwas left in strips. Some of the pieces were freehold, others copyhold,\r\nand the lord may have objected to having the boundaries\r\nobliterated.[99] Cross plowing is also occasionally referred to in\r\nthese surveys, but it was apparently rare.[99]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of improvement in this direction, although not to be\r\nignored, was, however, comparatively slight. The important changes\r\nwhich resulted from the increased size of the holdings were not so\r\nmuch in the direction of superior management of the land, as in that\r\nof making a selection between the different qualities of land, and\r\ncultivating only the land in comparatively good condition. Tenants\r\ntaking up additional land cultivated only a part of their enlarged\r\nholdings. The least productive strips were allowed to become overgrown\r\nwith grass. The better strips were kept under crop.\r\n\r\nIf we are to accept the testimony of Fitzherbert and Tusser, strips of\r\ngrass in the common fields, or lea land, as it was called, were a\r\nfeature of every open-field township, by the sixteenth century.\r\nAccording to Fitzherbert, \"in euery towneshyppe that standeth in\r\ntillage in the playne countrye, there be ... leyse to tye or tedder\r\ntheyr horses and mares vpon.\"[100] According to Tusser, the process of\r\nlaying to grass unproductive land was still going on.\r\n\r\n  Land arable driuen or worne to the proofe,\r\n    and craveth some rest for thy profits behoof,\r\n  With otes ye may sowe it the sooner to grasse\r\n    more sooner to pasture to bring it to passe.[101]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later surveys give additional evidence of the extent to which the\r\nnew tenantry had restricted the area of cultivation in the old fields\r\nwhich had once been entirely arable land. The most noteworthy feature\r\nof the survey of East Brandon, Durham (1606), was, according to Gray,\r\n\r\n    the appearance in certain fields of meadow along-side the arable.\r\n    Lowe field was almost transformed by such procedure, for seldom\r\n    did the tenants retain any arable there. Instead they had large\r\n    parcels of meadow, sometimes as many as twenty acres; nor does\r\n    anything indicate that these parcels were enclosed. They seem,\r\n    rather to have remained open and to point to a gradual abandonment\r\n    of arable tillage. Such an abandonment is more clearly indicated\r\n    by another survey of this series, that of Eggleston.... Presumably\r\n    the fields had once been largely arable. When, however, the survey\r\n    was made, change had begun, though not in the direction of\r\n    enclosure, of which there was still little. Conversion to meadow\r\n    had proceeded without it: nearly all the parcels of the various\r\n    tenants in East field and West field are said to have been meadow;\r\n    arable still predominated only in Middle field, and even there it\r\n    had begun to yield.[102]\r\n\r\nAt Westwick, Whorlton, Bolam and Willington in Durham, and at Welford,\r\nNorthamptonshire, a similar transformation had taken place.[103]\r\n\r\nThis land was obviously withdrawn from cultivation not because the\r\ntenants preferred grass land, or because grass land was more valuable\r\nthan arable, but because it could be plowed only at a loss. Where, as\r\nat Greens Norton, arable and leas are valued separately in the survey,\r\nthe grass land is shown to be of less value than the land still under\r\ncultivation.[104] The land craved rest, (to use Tusser's phrase), and\r\nthe grass which grew on it was of but little value. Here we have no\r\ncapitalist systematically buying up land for grazing, but a withdrawal\r\nof land from cultivation by the tenants themselves, even though they\r\nwere in no position to prepare it properly for grazing purposes. The\r\nimportance of this fact cannot be over-emphasized. It is true that\r\npasture, properly enclosed and stocked, was profitable, and that men\r\nwho were able to carry out this process became notorious among their\r\ncontemporaries on account of their gains. But it is also true that the\r\nland which was converted to pasture by these enclosers was fit for\r\nnothing else. Husbandmen had had to withdraw much of their open-field\r\nground from tillage simply because it was so unproductive that they\r\ncould not count on a bare return of seed if they planted it. The\r\npasturage for an additional horse or cow which these plots furnished\r\nwas pure gain, and was not the object of the conversion to grass. The\r\nunproductive strips would have been left untilled even though no\r\nalternative use had been possible. They were unfit for cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of holding this lea land did not end, however, with the\r\nfact that a few additional horses or cows could be kept on the grass\r\nwhich sprang up. This was undoubtedly of some value, but the greatest\r\nadvantage lay in the fact that this land gradually recovered its\r\nstrength. When the strips which were kept under cultivation finally\r\nproduced in their turn so little that they had to be abandoned, the\r\ntenant who had access to land which had been laid to grass years\r\nbefore could plow this instead, for it had regained its fertility and\r\nhad improved in physical quality. Fitzherbert recommends a regular\r\ninterchange between \"Reyst\" ground and arable land which had become\r\nexhausted. When the grass strips become mossy and make poor pasture,\r\nplow them up and plant them; when arable strips fail to produce good\r\ncrops, lay them to grass. Lea ground, \"the whiche hath ben errable\r\nland of late\" should be plowed up.\r\n\r\n     And if a man haue plentie of suche pasture, that wil be mossie\r\n     euery thyrd yere, lette hym breake vp a newe piece of gronde, and\r\n     plowe it and sowe it (as I haue seyde before), and he shal haue\r\n     plentye of corne, with littell dongynge, and sow it no lengar\r\n     thu it will beare plentye of corne, without donge, and it will\r\n     beare much better grasse, x or xii yere after.... Reyst grounde\r\n     if it be dry, will bringe much corne, for the mosse will rotte,\r\n     and the moll hillockes will amende the ground wel.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\nTusser's references to the practice of plowing up lea ground and\r\nlaying other land to grass are so incidental as to be good evidence of\r\nthe fact that this was not merely the recommendation of a theorist,\r\nbut a common practice, the details of which were familiar to those for\r\nwhom he intended his book. A passage in which he refers to the laying\r\nto grass of land in need of rest has already been quoted.[106] In\r\ndiscussing the date at which plowing should take place he mentions the\r\nplowing up of lea land as well as of fallow.[107]\r\n\r\nThe superior value of enclosed pasture to open-field leas, and of\r\nenclosed arable to open-field arable, is not only asserted by\r\nFitzherbert and others who are urging husbandmen to enclose their\r\nland, but appears also when manorial surveys are examined. It would\r\nseem, therefore, that the tenants would have been anxious to carry the\r\nprocess to an end and enclose their land. Undoubtedly the larger\r\nholders were desirous of making the change, but as long as the rights\r\nof the lesser men were respected, it was almost impossible to carry it\r\nout. The adjustment of conflicting and obscure claims was generally\r\nheld to be an insuperable obstacle, even by those who urged the change\r\nmost strongly, while those who on principle opposed anything in the\r\nway of enclosure took comfort in the fact that holdings were so\r\nintermixed that there was little prospect of accomplishing the change:\r\n\r\n     Wheare (men) are intercominers in comon feildes and also haue\r\n     theare portions so intermingled with an other that, thoughe they\r\n     would, they could not inclose anie parte of the saide feldes so\r\n     long as it is so.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as the services of a promoter are needed in the formation of a\r\nmodern industrial combination, pressure from above was usually\r\nnecessary in order to overcome the difficulties of the situation. The\r\nLord of Berkeley (1281-1321)\r\n\r\n     drewe much profitt to his Tenants and increase of fines to\r\n     himselfe ... by makeing and procuringe to bee made exchanges of\r\n     land mutually one with an other, thereby casting convenient\r\n     Parcells togeather, fitting it for an inclosure and conversion.\r\n     And by freeinge such inclosures from all comonage of others.[109]\r\n\r\nA landlord of this sort would do much to override the opposition of\r\nthose who, through conservatism, fear of personal loss, or insistence\r\nupon more than their share of the benefits of the readjustment, made\r\nit impossible for tenants to carry out these changes unassisted.\r\n\r\nWhere tenants with or without the assistance of the lord had managed\r\nto enclose some of their land and free it from right of common, they\r\nwere in a position to devote it to sheep-farming if they chose to do\r\nso. Ordinarily they did not do this. If, as has been claimed, the\r\nlarge-scale enclosures which shall be considered later were made\r\nbecause of an increasing demand for wool, it is surprising that these\r\nhusbandmen were willing to keep enclosed land under cultivation, and\r\neven to plow up enclosed pasture. The land had to be kept under grass\r\nfor a part of the time, whether it was open or enclosed, because if\r\nkept continuously under the plow it became unproductive; and it was\r\nbetter to have this land enclosed so that it could be used\r\nadvantageously as pasture during the period when it was recovering its\r\nstrength. But the profits of pasturage were not high enough to prevent\r\nmen from plowing up the land when it was again in fit condition.\r\n\r\nAt Forncett, the tenants had begun sheep-farming by the end of the\r\nfourteenth century, and had also begun to enclose land in the\r\nopen-fields; the situation was one, therefore, in which agriculture\r\nwas likely to be permanently displaced by grazing, according to the\r\ncommonly accepted theory of the enclosure movement. This change failed\r\nto take place; not because enclosures ceased to be made--nearly half\r\nof the acreage of the fields was in enclosures by 1565--but because\r\nthe tenants preferred to cultivate this enclosed land.[110] If the\r\nenclosures had been pasture when they were first made, they did not\r\nremain permanently under grass. Like the land still in the open\r\nfields, and like the small enclosures in Cheshire reported by the\r\ncommission of 1517, they were sometimes plowed and sometimes laid to\r\ngrass, according to the condition of the soil. In a Cheshire village,\r\ntwo tenants had small enclosures in the same field, which were treated\r\nin this way. At the time the commission visited the place, one of\r\nthese closes was being used as pasture, and the other was in\r\ncultivation. John Monkesfield's close, which had been made six years\r\nbefore,\r\n\r\n     _continet in se duas acras & diversis temporibus fuit in cultura\r\n     & aliis temporibus in pastura & nunc occupata est in\r\n     pastura._[111]\r\n\r\nJohn Molynes' close of one acre had been made the year before and\r\n\r\n     _fuit antea in pastura & nunc occupata est in cultura._\r\n\r\nIt had evidently been a strip of lea land which had been so improved\r\nby being kept under grass that it was in fit condition for\r\ncultivation, while John Monkesfield's close had been plowed long\r\nenough and was just at this time in need of rest. These men were\r\napparently unaffected by any increasing demand for wool, but were\r\nmanaging their land according to its needs.\r\n\r\nBy the sixteenth century, then, some enclosures had appeared in the\r\nopen fields, and the old common-field system was disintegrating. The\r\nold customary holdings had been so altered that they were hardly\r\nrecognizable. Some tenants held a great number of acres, and had\r\nmanaged by purchase or exchange to get possession of a number of\r\nadjacent strips, which they might, under certain conditions, be able\r\nto enclose. Much of the land, however, was withdrawn from cultivation,\r\nand for years was allowed to remain almost in the condition of waste.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, however, there had been no revolutionary change in\r\nthe system of husbandry. The framework remained. The whole community\r\nstill possessed claims extending over most of the land. The village\r\nflocks pastured on the stubble and the fallows of the open fields. The\r\nadvantages which could in theory be derived from the control of\r\nseveral adjacent strips of land were reduced to a minimum by the\r\nnecessity of maintaining old boundaries to mark off from each other\r\nlands of differing status. Even where the consolidation of holdings\r\nhad proceeded to some extent, the tenants who had acquired the most\r\ncompact holdings in comparison with the majority still possessed\r\nscattered plots of land separated from each other by the holdings of\r\nother men, and some of the smaller holders had no two strips which\r\ntouched each other. When the tenants had been left to themselves, all\r\nof the changes which took place before the eighteenth century,\r\nnumerous as they were, usually left the fields in a state resembling\r\nmore their condition in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries than that\r\nof the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] Levett and Ballard, _op. cit._, p. 49, note.\r\n\r\n[88] A speech on enclosures commending bills proposed in 1597\r\ncontrasts the constructive character of that legislation with the\r\nearlier laws: \"Where the gentleman that framed this bill hath dealt\r\nlike a most skilful chirugien, not clapping on a plaster to cover the\r\nsore that it spread no further, but searching into the very depths of\r\nthe wound that the life and strength which hath so long been in decay\r\nby the wasting of towns and countries may at length again be quickened\r\nand repaired.\" Bland, Brown & Tawney, _Eng.

No diminution of the area under tillage\r\nbeyond that which had already of necessity taken place occurred, and\r\nthe grass land already present in the fields was made available for\r\nmore profitable use. The Doctor in Hales' dialogue carefully excepts\r\nthis sort of enclosure from condemnation:\r\n\r\n     I meane not all Inclosures, nor yet all commons, but only of such\r\n     Inclosures as turneth commonly arable feildes into pastures; and\r\n     violent Inclosures, without Recompense of them that haue the\r\n     right to comen therein: for if the land weare seuerallie inclosed\r\n     to the intent to continue husbandrie theron, and euerie man, that\r\n     had Right to commen, had for his portion a pece of the same to\r\n     him selfe Inclosed, I thincke no harm but rather good should come\r\n     therof, yf euerie man did agre theirto.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this passage Hales recognizes the theoretical possibility of a\r\nbeneficial sort of enclosure, but the conditional form in which his\r\nremarks are thrown indicates that, so far as he knew, there was little\r\nsystematic division of the land among the tenants by common consent.\r\n\r\nOrderly rearrangement of holdings into compact plots suitable for\r\nenclosure was difficult unless the small holders had all disappeared,\r\nleaving in the community only men of some means, who were able to\r\nundertake the expenses of the readjustment. In most villages,\r\nhowever, holdings of all sizes were the rule. Some tenants had almost\r\nno land under cultivation, but picked up a living by working for\r\nothers, and by keeping a few sheep on the commons and on the fallow\r\nlands of the town. There was thus always a fringe of peasant families\r\non the verge of destitution. They were being gradually eliminated, but\r\nthe process was extremely slow. A few of them in each generation,\r\nfeeling as a realized fact the increasing misery which has been\r\npredicted for the modern industrial laborer, were forced to give up\r\nthe struggle. Their land passed into the hands of the more prosperous\r\nmen, who were thus gradually accumulating most of the land. In some\r\ncases, no doubt, all of the poorer tenantry were drained off in this\r\nfashion, making it possible for those who remained to consolidate\r\ntheir holdings and enclose them in the fashion advocated by\r\nFitzherbert, keeping a part under tillage until it needed a rest, and\r\npasturing sheep and cattle in the closes which were under grass.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the number of these cases. What we do\r\nknow is that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries no such stage\r\nhad been reached in hundreds of English townships. The enclosures\r\nwhich had been made by the tenants were of a few acres here and there.\r\nThe fields for the most part were still open and subject to common,\r\nand consisted in part of poor pasture land. We do know also that many\r\nlandlords took matters into their own hands, dispossessed the tenants,\r\nand enclosed a part or all of the land for sheep pastures. The date at\r\nwhich this step was made, and the thoroughness with which it was\r\ncarried out, depended very much upon the character and needs of the\r\nlandlord, as well as upon local circumstances affecting the condition\r\nof the soil and the degree of poverty suffered by the tenants. The\r\ntendency for landlords to lose patience with the process which was\r\ngradually eliminating the poorer men and concentrating their land in\r\nthe hands of the more prosperous is not characteristic of any one\r\ncentury. It began as early as the middle of the fourteenth century,\r\nand it extended well into the seventeenth. By 1402 clergy were being\r\nindicted as _depopulatores agrorum_.[113] In the fifteenth century\r\nstatutes against enclosure and depopulation were beginning to be\r\npassed, and Rous gives a list of fifty-four places near Warwick which\r\nhad been wholly or partially depopulated before about 1486.[114] For\r\nthe sixteenth century, we have the evidence of numerous statutes, the\r\nreturns of the commissions, doggerel verse, popular insurrections,\r\nsermons, _etc._ Miss Leonard's study of the seventeenth-century\r\nenclosures is confirmed by additional evidence presented by Gonner\r\nthat the movement was unchecked in this period. In 1692, for instance,\r\nHoughton was attacking the \"common notion that enclosure always leads\r\nto grass,\" by pointing out a few exceptions.[115] In 1695 Gibson spoke\r\nof the change from tillage to pasture, which had been largely within\r\nliving memory.[116]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the landowners who carried out this\r\nprocess were unusually mercenary and heartless. The need for putting\r\ntheir land to some remunerative use was imperative, and it is\r\nsurprising that the enclosure movement was of such a piece-meal\r\ncharacter and extended over so many years, rather than that it took\r\nplace at all.\r\n\r\nThere was little rent to be had from land which lay for the most part\r\nin open fields, tilled by men who had no capital at their command for\r\nimproving the condition of the soil, or for utilizing profitably the\r\nportion of the land which was so impoverished that it could not be\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nPoor tenants are unprofitable tenants; it is difficult to collect rent\r\nfrom them and impossible to raise their rent, and they attempt to save\r\nby exploiting the land, leaving it in worse condition than when they\r\nreceived it. Contemporary references to the poverty of these\r\nopen-field tenants all confirm the impression given by Hales:\r\n\r\n     They that be husbandmen now haue but a scant lyvinge therby.[117]\r\n     I that haue enclosed litle or nothinge of my grond could (never\r\n     be able) to make vp my lordes rent weare it not for a little\r\n     brede of neate, shepe, swine, gese and hens that I doe rere vpon\r\n     my ground: whereof, because the price is sumwhat round, I make\r\n     more cleare proffitt than I doe of all my corne and yet I haue\r\n     but a bare liuinge.[118]\r\n\r\nHarrison, at the end of the century, writes of the open-field tenants:\r\n\r\n     They were scarce able to liue and paie their rents at their daies\r\n     without selling of a cow or an horsse, or more, although they\r\n     paid but foure poundes at the vttermost by the yeare.[119]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenant who could not pay this rent without selling stock was, of\r\ncourse, one of those who would soon have to give up his land\r\naltogether, if the landlord continued to demand rent. If he sold his\r\nhorses and oxen to raise the rent one year, he was less able to work\r\nhis land properly the next year, and the crop, too small in the first\r\nplace to enable him to cover expenses, diminished still more. When\r\nthe current income was ordinarily too small to cover current expenses,\r\nno relief was to be found by reducing the capital. A time came when\r\nthese men must be either turned away, and their land leased to others,\r\nor else allowed to stay and make what poor living they could from the\r\nsoil, without paying even the nominal rent which was to be expected of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLord North's comment on the enclosure movement as he saw it in the\r\nseventeenth century is suggestive of the state of affairs which led to\r\nthe eviction of these husbandmen:\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of late years have taken up an humor of destroying\r\n     their tenements and cottages, whereby they make it impossible\r\n     that mankind should inhabit their estates. This is done sometimes\r\n     barefaced because they harbour poor that are a charge to the\r\n     parish, and sometimes because the charge of repairing is great,\r\n     and if an house be ruinous they will not be at the cost of\r\n     rebuilding and repairing it, and cast their lands into very great\r\n     farms which are managed with less housing: and oftimes for\r\n     improvement as it is called which is done by buying in all\r\n     freeholds, copyholds, and tenements that have common and which\r\n     harboured very many husbandry and labouring families and then\r\n     enclosing the commons and fields, turning the managry from\r\n     tillage to grasing.[120]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only were these men able to pay little rent for the land they\r\nheld, but, as has been suggested, they were unable to maintain the\r\nland in proper condition by the use of manure and marl. These expenses\r\nwere beyond the means of the farmer who was falling behind; they\r\nneglected the soil because they were poor, and they were poor because\r\nthe yield of the land was so low; but their neglect caused it to\r\ndecline even more. Fitzherbert, who deplores the fact that marl is no\r\nlonger used in his time, points out that not only the leaseholder, who\r\nis averse to making improvements on account of the insecurity of his\r\ntenure, but the freeholder, also, is neglecting his land; although\r\n\r\n     He knoweth well, he shall take the profits while he liueth, & his\r\n     heyres after him, a corrage to improw his owne, the which is as\r\n     good as and he purchased as much as the improwment cometh\r\n     to.[121]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if he spent money on marling the soil, he would have nothing to\r\nlive on while waiting for the crop. The very poverty of the small\r\nholders made it necessary for them to sink in still greater poverty,\r\nuntil the lord deprived them of the land, or until they became so\r\ndiscouraged that they gave it up of their own volition. They might\r\neasily understand the force of Fitzherbert's arguments without being\r\nable to follow his advice. \"Marle mendeth all manor of grounde, but it\r\nis costly.\"[122] The same thing is true of manure. According to\r\nDenton, the expense of composting land was almost equivalent to the\r\nvalue of the fee simple of the ground. He refers to a record of the\r\nearly fourteenth century of the payment of more than twice the\r\nordinary rent for composted land.[123] With manure at high prices, the\r\nman in difficulty might be tempted to sell what he had; it was\r\ncertainly out of the question for him to buy more. Or, what amounted\r\nto the same thing, he might sell hay or straw, and so reduce the\r\nforage for his cattle, and return less to the soil by means of their\r\ndung.\r\n\r\nDr. Simkhovitch points out the difference between the farmer who is\r\nunable to meet expenses in a particular year because of an\r\nexceptionally bad season, and one who is suffering because of\r\nprogressive deterioration of his farm. The first may borrow and make\r\ngood the difference the following year; the latter will be unable to\r\nextricate himself. He neither has means to increase his holding by\r\nrenting or buying more land, nor to improve the land which he has\r\nalready. His distress is cumulative:\r\n\r\n     Only one with sufficient resources can improve his land. By\r\n     improving land we add to our capital, while by robbing land we\r\n     immediately add to our income; in doing so, however, we diminish\r\n     out of all proportion our capital as farmers, the productive\r\n     value of our farm land. The individual farmer can therefore\r\n     improve his land only when in an economically strong position. A\r\n     farmer who is failing to make a living on his farm is more likely\r\n     to exploit his farm to the utmost; and when there is no room for\r\n     further exploitation he is likely to meet the deficit by\r\n     borrowing, and thus pledging the future productivity of his\r\n     farm.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile small holders in the open fields were in no position to pay\r\nhigher rents, the land owners were suffering. Prices were rising, and\r\nwhile the higher price of farm produce in the market was of little\r\nhelp to the tenant whose own family used nearly everything he could\r\nraise, the landlords felt the pressure of an increasing cost of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n     Many of us [says the Gentleman, in Hales' dialogue] haue bene\r\n     driuen to giue over oure houshold, and to kepe either a chambere\r\n     in london, or to waight on the courte Vncalled, with a man and a\r\n     lacky after him, wheare he was wonte to kepe halfe a score cleane\r\n     men in his house, and xxtie or xxxtie other persons besides,\r\n     everie day in the weke.... We are forced either to minyshe the\r\n     thirde parte of our houshold, or to raise the thirde parte of our\r\n     Revenues.[125]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for the landowners to make economic use of even those\r\nportions of the land which were not in the hands of customary tenants.\r\nIf they were willing to invest capital in enclosing demesne land and\r\nstocking it with sheep, without disturbing their small tenants, they\r\nfound it impossible to do so. Not only did the poorer tenants have to\r\ncultivate land which was barely productive of more than the seed used,\r\nbecause they could not afford to allow it to lie idle as long as it\r\nwould produce anything; not only did they allow the land which was\r\nunder grass to remain practically waste, because they could not afford\r\nto enclose it and stock it with sheep; not only did they neglect\r\nmanuring and marling the land because these improvements were beyond\r\ntheir means, so that the land was constantly growing poorer in their\r\nhands, and so that they could pay very little rent; but they were also\r\ntenacious of their rights of common over the rest of the land, and\r\nresisted all attempts at enclosure of the holdings of the more\r\nprosperous tenants, because they had to depend for their living\r\nlargely upon the \"little brede of neate, shepe, swine, gese and hens\"\r\nwhich were maintained partly by the gleanings from other men's land\r\nwhen it lay common.\r\n\r\nThey undoubtedly suffered when the lord himself or one of the large\r\nleaseholders insisted on enclosing some of the land. If the commonable\r\narea was reduced, or if the land enclosed was converted from arable to\r\npasture (as it usually was), the means by which they made their living\r\nwas diminished. The occasional day's wages for labor spent on the land\r\nconverted was now withdrawn, and the pasturage for the little flock\r\nwas cut down. The practical effect of even the most innocent-looking\r\nenclosures, then, must have been to deprive the poorer families of the\r\nmeans of livelihood, even though they were not evicted from their\r\nworthless holdings. Enclosures and depopulation were inseparably\r\nlinked in the minds of contemporaries, even when the greatest care was\r\ntaken by the enclosing authorities to safeguard the rights of the\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\nThese rights, however, seriously interfered with the most advantageous\r\nuse of land, and often were disregarded. Not only did the small\r\nholders have rights of common over the rest of the land, but their own\r\nstrips were intermingled with those of the lord and the large holders.\r\nThe typical problem confronting the enclosing landlord is shown below:\r\n\r\n    HOLDINGS IN OPEN FIELD, WEST LEXHAM, NORFOLK, 1575[126]\r\n\r\n       _Strips in Furlong A_             _Strips in Furlong B_\r\n     1.

Demesne.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as was probably the case, the product from these demesne strips\r\nwas so small that the land was fit only for conversion to pasture, the\r\npecuniary interest of the lord was to be served best by enclosing it\r\nand converting it. But should he make three enclosures in furlong A,\r\nand two in furlong B, besides taking pains to leave a way clear for\r\nWill Yelverton and Lee and Gell to reach their land? Or should he be\r\ncontent merely with enclosing the larger plots of land, because of the\r\nexpense of hedging and ditching the smaller plots separately from the\r\nrest? If he did this, the unenclosed portions would be of little\r\nvalue, as the grass which grew on them could not be properly utilized\r\nfor pasture. The final alternative was to get possession of the strips\r\nwhich did not form part of the demesne, so that the whole could be\r\nmade into one compact enclosure. In order to do this it might be\r\nnecessary to dispossess Will Lee, Will Gell, _etc._ The intermingling\r\nof holdings, in such a way that small holders (whose own land was in\r\nsuch bad condition that they could not pay their rents) blocked the\r\nway for improvements on the rest of the land, was probably responsible\r\nfor many evictions which would not otherwise have taken place.\r\n\r\nBut not all evictions were due to this cause alone. The income to the\r\nowner from land which was left in the hands of customary tenants was\r\nmuch lower than if it was managed by large holders with sufficient\r\ncapital to carry out necessary changes. Where it is possible to\r\ncompare the rents paid by large and small holders on the same manor,\r\nthis fact is apparent:\r\n\r\n    AVERAGE RENT PER ACRE OF LAND ON FIVE MANORS IN WILTSHIRE, 1568[127]\r\n\r\n                                         I            II          III\r\n\r\n                                      s.   d.      s.   d.      s.    d.\r\n\r\n    Lands held by farmers             1    6            7 3/4   1     5 3/4\r\n\r\n    Lands held by customary tenants        7 1/2        5       1     0 3/4\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          IV            V\r\n\r\n                                        s.  d.        s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Lands held by farmers               1   1 3/4     1   5 1/2\r\n\r\n    Lands held by customary tenants         5 3/4         5 3/4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe differences in these rents are sufficient to be tempting to the\r\nlord who was seeking his own interest. The large holders were able to\r\nexpend the capital necessary for enclosing and converting the part of\r\nthe land which could not be profitably cultivated because of its bad\r\ncondition. The capital necessary for this process itself was\r\nconsiderable, and besides, it was necessary to wait several years\r\nbefore there was a return on the investment, while the sod was\r\nforming, to say nothing of the large expenditure necessary for the\r\npurchase of the sheep. The land when so treated, however, enabled the\r\ninvestor to pay higher rents than the open-field husbandmen who\r\n\"rubbed forth their estate in the poorest plight.\"[128]\r\n\r\nA lord who was willing to consider only pecuniary advantage had\r\neverything to gain by clearing the land entirely of small holders, and\r\nputting it in the hands of men with capital. It is, therefore, to the\r\ncredit of these landowners that there are so few authentic cases of\r\nthe depopulation of entire villages and the conversion of all of the\r\narable land into sheep runs. These cases made the lords who were\r\nresponsible notorious and were, no doubt, exceptional. Nearly fifteen\r\nhundred places were covered by the reports of the commissions of 1517\r\nand 1607, and Professor Gay has found among these \"but a round dozen\r\nvillages or hamlets which were all enclosed and emptied of their\r\ninhabitants, the full half of them in Northamptonshire.\"[129] For the\r\nmost part, the enclosures reported under the inquisitions as well as\r\nthose indicated on the maps and surveys of the period involved only\r\nsmall areas, and point to a process of piece-meal enclosure. The\r\nlandowners seem to have been reluctant to cause hardship and to have\r\nleft the open-field tenants undisturbed as far as possible, contenting\r\nthemselves with the enclosure and conversion of small plots of land.\r\n\r\nThe social consequences of so-called depopulating enclosure were\r\nserious, but they are not seen in their proper perspective when one\r\nimagines the condition of the evicted tenants to have been fairly good\r\nbefore they were dispossessed. The cause lying back of the enclosure\r\nmovement was bringing about the gradual sinking of family after\r\nfamily, even when no evictions were made. To attribute the poverty and\r\nmisery of the rural population to the enclosure movement is to\r\noverlook the unhappy condition of the peasants, even where no\r\nenclosures had been made. Enclosures had been forbidden in the fields\r\nof royal manors in Northamptonshire, but this did not protect the\r\npeasantry from destitution. The manor of Grafton, for instance, was\r\nsurveyed in 1526 and a note was made at the end of the survey that the\r\nrevenue drawn from the lordship had lately been increased, but \"there\r\ncan no ferther enprovemente there be made and to kepe the tenantries\r\nstandyng. Item the tenauntriez there be in sore decaye.\" The surveyor\r\nof Hartwell also notes that the \"tenements there be in decay.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe economic basis of the unfortunate social changes which were\r\nassociated with the process of enclosure came gradually to be\r\nrecognized. It was evidently futile to enact laws requiring the\r\ncultivation of land \"wasted and worn with continual plowing and\r\nthereby made bare, barren and very unfruitfull.\"[131] Merely\r\nrestrictive and prohibitory legislation was followed by the suggestion\r\nof constructive measures. Until the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nlaws were made in the attempt to put a stop to the conversion of\r\narable land to pasture under any conditions, and required that land\r\nwhich had been under cultivation should be plowed in the future. In\r\nthe act of 1552, however, an attitude somewhat more reasonable is to\r\nbe seen. It was provided that land which had been under cultivation\r\nwithin a certain number of years preceding the act should be tilled,\r\n\"_or so much in quantity_.\"[132] Public men were also urging that less\r\ntime be devoted to the futile attempt to force men to cultivate land\r\nunfit for tillage, and that encouragement be given instead to measures\r\nfor improving the waste, and bringing fresh land under the plow.[133]\r\n\r\nAfter a time, moreover, another fact became apparent: there was a\r\nmarked tendency to break up and again cultivate the land which in\r\nformer generations had been converted to pasture. The statute of 1597\r\nnot only contained a proviso permitting the conversion of arable\r\nfields to pasture on condition that other land be tilled instead,[134]\r\nthus tacitly admitting that the reason for withdrawing land from\r\ncultivation was not the low price of grain, but the barrenness of the\r\nland, but also explicitly referred to this fact in another proviso\r\npermitting the conversion of arable land to pasture temporarily, _for\r\nthe purpose of recovering its strength_:\r\n\r\n     Provided, nevertheless, That if anie _P_son or Body Pollitique or\r\n     Corporate hath ... laide or hereafter shall lay anie grownde to\r\n     graze, or hathe used or shall use the same grownde with shepe or\r\n     anie other cattell, which Grownde hath bene or shall be dryven or\r\n     worne owte with Tillage, onely upon good Husbandrie, and with\r\n     intente bona fide withowt Fraude or Covyne the same Grownde shall\r\n     recover Harte and Strengthe, an not with intent to continue the\r\n     same otherwise in shepe Pasture or for fattinge or grazinge of\r\n     Cattell, that no such _P_son or Body Politike or Corporate shall\r\n     be intended for that Grownde a Converter within the meaning of\r\n     this Lawe.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\nA speaker in the House of Commons commends these provisions:\r\n\r\n     For it fareth with the earth as with other creatures that through\r\n     continual labour grow faint and feeble-hearted, and therefore, if\r\n     it be so far driven as to be out of breath, we may now by this\r\n     law resort to a more lusty and proud piece of ground while the\r\n     first gathers strength, which will be a means that the earth\r\n     yearly shall be surcharged with burden of her own excess. And\r\n     this did the former lawmakers overslip, tyeing the land once\r\n     tilled to a perpetual bondage and servitude of being ever\r\n     tilled.[136]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years before the passage of this statute, Bacon had remarked\r\nthat men were breaking up pasture land and planting it voluntarily.[137]\r\nIn 1619, a commission was appointed to consider the granting of licenses\r\n\"for arable lands converted from tillage to pasture.\" The proclamation\r\ncreating this commission, after referring to the laws formerly made\r\nagainst such conversions, continues:\r\n\r\n     As there is much arable land of that nature become pasture, so is\r\n     there by reason thereof, much more other lands of old pasture and\r\n     waste, and wood lands where the plough neuer entred, as well as\r\n     of the same pasture lands so heretofore conuerted, become\r\n     errable, and by husbandrie made fruitfull with corne ... the\r\n     quantitie and qualitie of errable and Corne lands at this day\r\n     doth much exceed the quantitie that was at the making of the\r\n     saide Lawe.... As the want thereof [of corn] shall appeare, or\r\n     the price thereof increase, all or a great part of those lands\r\n     which were heretofore converted from errable to pasture and have\r\n     sithence gotten heart, strength and fruitfulness, will be reduced\r\n     to Corne lands againe, to the great increase of graine to the\r\n     Commonwealth and profite to each man in his private.[138]\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hales had protested against depopulating enclosures, in 1549, by\r\nappealing to the public spirit of landowners. They increased their\r\nprofits by converting arable land to pasture, but, he argued,\r\n\r\n     It may not be liefull for euery man to vse his owne as hym\r\n     lysteth, but eueyre man must vse that he hath to the most\r\n     benefyte of his countrie. Ther must be somethynge deuysed to\r\n     quenche this insatiable thirst of greedynes of men.[139]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now it was no longer necessary to persuade the owners of this same\r\nland to forgo their own interests for the sake of the public good.\r\nThose whose land had been used as pasture for a great number of years\r\nwere finding it valuable arable, because of its long period of rest\r\nand regeneration. Land which had been converted to pasture was being\r\nput under the plow because of the greater profit of tillage.\r\n\r\nSo great was the profit of cultivating these pastures that landlords\r\nwho were opposed to having pastures broken up by leaseholders had\r\ndifficulty in preventing it. Towards the end of the sixteenth century\r\nat Hawsted, and in the beginning of the seventeenth, a number of\r\nleases contained the express provision that no pastures were to be\r\nbroken up. In 1620 and the years following, some of the leases\r\npermitted cultivation of pasture, on the condition that the land was\r\nto be laid to grass again five years before the expiration of the\r\nlease.[140]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt of the fact that much land was being converted from\r\npasture to arable in this period. Evidence of this tendency multiplies\r\nas the century advances. In 1656 Joseph Lee gave a list of fifteen\r\ntowns where arable land hitherto converted to pasture had been plowed\r\nup again within thirty years.[141]\r\n\r\nBarren and insufficiently manured land did not produce good crops\r\nmerely because other land had been given an opportunity to recover its\r\nstrength. The conversion of open-field arable to pasture went on\r\nunchecked in the seventeenth century because it had not yet had the\r\nbenefit of the prolonged rest which made agriculture profitable, and\r\nwithout which it had become impossible to make a living from the soil.\r\nThe lands which have been \"heretofore converted from errable to\r\npasture.... have sithence gotten heart, strength and fruitfulnesse,\"\r\nand are therefore being plowed again; but the land which has escaped\r\nconversion, and has been tied to the \"perpetual bondage and servitude\r\nof being ever tilled,\" is \"faint and feeble-hearted,\" and is being\r\nlaid to grass, for pasture is the only use for which it is suited. The\r\ncause of the conversion of arable fields to pasture is the same as\r\nthat which caused the same change on other lands at an earlier\r\ndate--so low a level of productivity that the land was not worth\r\ncultivating. Lands whose fertility had been restored were put under\r\ncultivation and plowed until they were again in need of rest.\r\n\r\nThus the final result was about the same whether an enclosing landlord\r\ncut across the gradual process of readjustment of land-holding among\r\nthe tenants, and converted the whole into pasture, or whether the\r\nprocess was allowed to go on until none but large holders remained in\r\nthe village. In both cases the tendency was towards a system of\r\nhusbandry in which the fertility of the soil was maintained by\r\nperiodically withdrawing portions of it from cultivation and laying\r\nit to grass. In the one case, cultivation was completely suspended for\r\na number of years, but was gradually reintroduced as it became evident\r\nthat the land had recovered its strength while used as pasture. In the\r\nother, the grazing of sheep and cattle was introduced as a\r\nby-industry, for the sake of utilizing the land which had been set\r\naside to recover its strength, while the better land was kept under\r\nthe plow. Whether enclosures were made for better agriculture, then,\r\nas Mr. Leadam contends, or for pasture, as is argued by Professor\r\nGay,[142] the arable enclosures were used as pasture for a part of the\r\ntime and the enclosed pastures came later to be used for tillage part\r\nof the time, and the two things amount to the same thing in the end.\r\n\r\nThis end, however, had still not been reached in a great number of\r\nopen-field villages by the beginning of the eighteenth century, and we\r\nshould expect to find that the history of the land in this century was\r\nbut a repetition of what had gone before, in so far as the fields\r\nwhich had not hitherto been enclosed are concerned.\r\n\r\nBut, during the seventeenth century, an agricultural revolution was\r\ntaking place. Experiments were being made with new forage crops. For\r\none thing, it was found that turnips could be grown in the fields and\r\nthat they made excellent winter forage; and grass seeding was\r\nintroduced. The grasses and clovers which were brought from Holland\r\nnot only made excellent hay, but improved the soil rapidly. The\r\npossibility of increasing the amount of hay at will put an end to the\r\nabsolute scarcity of manure--the limiting factor in English\r\nagriculture from the beginning. And the comparative ease with which\r\nthe artificial grasses could be made to grow did away with the need\r\nof waiting ten or fifteen years, or perhaps half a century, for\r\nnatural grass to cover the fields and restore their productiveness.\r\n\r\n     Only with the introduction of grass seeding did it become\r\n     possible to keep a sufficient amount of stock, not only to\r\n     maintain the fertility of the soil, but to improve it steadily.\r\n     The soil instead of being taxed year after year under the heavy\r\n     strain of grain crops was being renovated by the legumes that\r\n     gathered nitrogen from the air and stored it on tubercles\r\n     attached to their roots. The deep roots of the clover penetrated\r\n     the soil, that no plow ever touched. Legumes like alfalfa,\r\n     producing pound by pound more nutritious fodder than meadow\r\n     grass, produced acre by acre two and three times the amount, and\r\n     when such a field was turned under to make place for a grain\r\n     crop, the deep and heavy sod, the mass of decaying roots, offered\r\n     the farmer \"virgin\" soil, where previously even five bushels of\r\n     wheat could not be gathered.[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the value of these new crops became generally recognized, some\r\neffort was made to introduce them into the regular rotation of crops\r\nin the fields which were still held in common, but, for the most part,\r\nthese efforts were unsuccessful, and new vigor was given to the\r\nenclosure movement. Frequently persons having no arable land of their\r\nown had right of common over the stubble and fallow which could not be\r\nexercised when turnips and clover were planted; for reasons of this\r\nsort, it was difficult to change the ancient course of crops in the\r\nopen fields. For example, late in the eighteenth century (1793) at\r\nStiffkey and Morston, the improvements due to enclosure are said to\r\nhave been great, for:\r\n\r\n     being half-year land before, they could raise no turnips except\r\n     by agreement, nor cultivate their land to the best\r\n     advantage.[144]\r\n\r\nAt Heacham the common fields were enclosed by act in 1780, and Young\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\n     Before the enclosure they were in no regular shifts and the field\r\n     badly managed; now in regular five-shift Norfolk management.[145]\r\n\r\nAt Northwald, about 3,000 acres of open-field land were enclosed in\r\n1796 and clover was introduced. The comment made is that \"the crops\r\nbear quite a new face.\" The common field of Brancaster before\r\nenclosure in 1755 \"was in an open, rude bad state; now in five or six\r\nregular shifts.\"[146]\r\n\r\nHitherto there had been only one way of restoring fertility to land;\r\nconverting it to pasture and leaving it under grass for a prolonged\r\nperiod. Now it could be speedily improved and used intensively. Arthur\r\nYoung describes the modern method of improvement in his account of the\r\nchanges made in Norfolk husbandry before 1771:\r\n\r\n     From forty to fifty years ago, all the northern and western and a\r\n     great part of the eastern tracts of the county were sheep walks,\r\n     let so low as from 6 _d._ to 1_s._ 6 _d._ and 2 _s._ an acre.\r\n     Much of it was in this condition only thirty years ago. The\r\n     improvements have been made by the following circumstances.\r\n\r\n     First. By enclosing without the assistance of Parliament.\r\n\r\n     Second. By a spirited use of marl and clay.\r\n\r\n     Third. By the introduction of an excellent course of crops.\r\n\r\n     Fourth. By the introduction of turnips well hand-hoed.\r\n\r\n     Fifth. By the culture of clover and ray-grass.\r\n\r\n     Sixth. By the lords granting long leases.\r\n\r\n     Seventh. By the country being divided chiefly into large farms.[147]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence which has been examined in this monograph reveals the\r\nfar-reaching influence of soil exhaustion in English agrarian history\r\nin the centuries before the introduction of these new crops. As the\r\nyield of the soil declined, the ancient arable holdings proved\r\nincapable of supporting their cultivators, and a readjustment had to\r\nbe made. The pressure upon subsistence was felt while villainage was\r\nstill in force, and the terms upon which serfdom dissolved were\r\ninfluenced by this fact to an extent which has hitherto not been\r\nrecognized. The economic crisis involved in the spread of the money\r\neconomy threw into relief the destitution of the villains; and the\r\neasy terms of the cash payments which were substituted for services\r\nformerly due, the difficulty with which holders for land could be\r\nobtained on any terms, the explicit references to the poverty of whole\r\ncommunities at the time of the commutation of their customary\r\nservices, necessitate the abandonment of the commonly accepted view\r\nthat growing prosperity and the desire for better social status\r\nexplain the substitution of money payments for labor services in the\r\nfourteenth century. The spread of the money economy was due to the\r\ngradual integration of the economic system, the establishment of local\r\nmarkets where small land holders could sell their produce for money.\r\nUntil this condition was present, it was impossible to offer money\r\ninstead of labor in payment of the customary dues; as soon as this\r\ncondition was present, the greater convenience of the use of money\r\nmade the commutation of services inevitable. In practise money\r\npayments came gradually to replace the performance of services through\r\nthe system of \"selling\" works long before any formal commutation of\r\nthe services took place. But, whatever the explanation of the spread\r\nof the money economy in England during this period, it is not the\r\nprosperity of the villains, for, at the moment when the formal change\r\nfrom payments in labor to money payments was made, the poverty and\r\ndestitution of the landholders were conspicuous. That this poverty was\r\ndue to declining fertility of the soil cannot be doubted. Land in\r\ndemesne as well as virgate land was showing the effects of centuries\r\nof cultivation with insufficient manure, and returned so scant a crop\r\nthat much of it was withdrawn from cultivation, even when serf labor\r\nwith which to cultivate it was available. Exhaustion of the soil was\r\nthe cause of the pauperism of the fourteenth century, as it was also\r\nof the enclosure and conversion to pasture of arable land in the\r\nfifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Systematic enclosure\r\nfor the purpose of sheep-farming on a large scale was but the final\r\nstep in a process of progressively less intense cultivation which had\r\nbeen going on for centuries. The attention of some historians has been\r\ndevoted too exclusively to the covetous sheep-master, against whom\r\ncontemporary invective was directed, and the process which was going\r\non in fields where no encloser was at work has escaped their notice.\r\nThe three-field system was breaking down as it became necessary to\r\nwithdraw this or that exhausted plot from cultivation entirely for a\r\nnumber of years. The periodic fallow had proved incapable of keeping\r\nthe land in proper condition for bearing crops even two years out of\r\nthree, and everywhere strips of uncultivated land began to appear in\r\nthe common fields. This lea land--waste land in the midst of the\r\narable--was a common feature of sixteenth and seventeenth century\r\nhusbandry. The strips kept under cultivation gave a bare return for\r\nseed, and the profit of sheep-raising need not have been\r\nextraordinarily high to induce landowners to abandon cultivation\r\nentirely under these conditions. A great part of the arable fields lay\r\nwaste, and could be put to no profitable use unless the whole was\r\nenclosed and stocked with sheep. The high profit made from\r\nsheep-raising cannot be explained by fluctuations in the price of\r\nwool. The price of wool fell in the fifteenth century. Sheep-farming\r\nwas comparatively profitable because the soil of the ancient fields\r\nwas too barren to repay the costs of tillage. Land which was in part\r\nalready abandoned, was turned into pasture. The barrenness and low\r\nproductivity of the common fields is explicitly recognised by\r\ncontemporaries, and is given as the reason for the conversion of\r\narable to pasture. Its use as pasture for a long period of years gave\r\nit the needed rest and restored its fertility, and pasture land which\r\ncould bear crops was being brought again under cultivation during the\r\ncenturies in which the enclosure movement was most marked.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[112] Lamond, _op. cit._, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[113] 4 H. 4, c. 2.

It is based on lectures delivered in\r\nthe Johns Hopkins University in 1912, and later revised for\r\npublication. The subject involves one of the most intricate problems\r\nin American history, and Professor Cox has spared no pains in\r\nsearching for new sources of information. He has not only availed\r\nhimself of the collections in Washington and of the material in the\r\nDepartment of Archives and History at Jackson, Mississippi, but he has\r\npersonally searched the archives at Seville and Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe volume deals with the secret intrigues of statesmen and diplomats\r\nin the capitals of America and Europe on the one hand, and with the\r\naggressive, irresponsible movements of impatient frontiersmen on the\r\nother. Professor Cox thinks that the sturdy pioneers of the Southwest\r\noutstripped the diplomats, and that their deeds were the decisive\r\nfactors in the settlement of the long and bitter controversy that was\r\nwaged over West Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS PRESS\r\nBaltimore, Maryland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColombia University Press Publications\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CITY PROGRESS AND THE LAW.
