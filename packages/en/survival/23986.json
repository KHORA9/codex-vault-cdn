Three bright children\r\nwere descending by a winding path towards the little village; a bright\r\nold man was coming up from the little village by the same path, meeting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe three children were named William Earnest, Fred Frazer, and Alice.\r\nAlice was William Earnest's sister, while Fred Frazer was his cousin.\r\nWilliam Earnest was the eldest, and he was something more than eleven\r\nand something less than twelve years old. His cousin Fred Frazer was\r\nnearly a year younger, while his sister Alice was a little more than two\r\nyears younger still. Fred Frazer was on a holiday visit to his\r\nrelatives, it being vacation time from school; and the three children\r\nwere ready for any kind of adventure, and for every sort of fun.\r\n\r\nThe children saw the old man before the old man saw the children; for\r\nthe children were looking down the hill, while the old man, coming up\r\nthe hill, was looking at his footsteps.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the children saw the old man, the eldest recognized him as a\r\nfriend; and no sooner had his eyes lighted on him than, much excited, he\r\nshouted loudly, \"Hurrah, there comes the ancient mariner!\"\r\n\r\nHis cousin, much surprised, asked quickly, \"Who's the ancient mariner?\"\r\nAnd his sister, more surprised, asked timidly, \"What's the ancient\r\nmariner?\"\r\n\r\nThen the eldest, much elated, asked derisively, \"Why, don't you know?\"\r\nAnd then he said, instructively: \"He's been about here for ever so long\r\na time; but he went away last year, and I haven't seen him for a great\r\nwhile. He's the most wonderful man you ever saw,--tells such splendid\r\nstories,--all about shipwrecks, pirates, savages, Chinamen, bear-hunts,\r\nbull-fights, and everything else that you can think of. I call him the\r\n'Ancient Mariner,' but that isn't his right name. He's Captain Hardy;\r\nbut he looks like an ancient mariner, as he is, and I got the name out\r\nof a book. Some of the fellows call him 'Old Father Neptune.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What a funny name!\" cried Fred.\r\n\r\n\"What do they call him Father Neptune for?\" inquired Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" answered William, looking very wise,--\"because, you know,\r\nNeptune, he's god of the sea, and Captain Hardy looks just like the\r\npictures of him in the story-books. That's why they call him Old Father\r\nNeptune.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the old man had come quite near, and William, suddenly\r\nleaving his companions, dashed ahead to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"O Captain Hardy, I'm so glad to see you!\" exclaimed the little fellow,\r\nas he rushed upon him. \"Where did you come from? Where have you been so\r\nlong? How are you? Quite well, I hope,\"--and he grasped the old man's\r\nhand with both his own, and shook it heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lad,\" replied the old man, kindly, \"I'm right glad to see you,\r\nand will be right glad to answer all your questions, if you'll let them\r\noff easy like, and not all in a broadside\"; and as they walked on up the\r\npath together, William's questions were answered to his entire\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThen they came presently to Fred and Alice, who were introduced by\r\nWilliam, very much to the delight of Fred; but Alice was inclined to be\r\na little frightened, until the strange old man spoke to her in such a\r\ngentle way that it banished all timidity; and then, taking the hand\r\nwhich he held out to her, she trudged on beside him, happy and pleased\r\nas she could be.\r\n\r\nThe party were not long in reaching the gate leading up to the house of\r\nWilliam's father. A large old-fashioned country-house it was, standing\r\namong great tall trees, a good way up from the high-road; and William\r\nasked his friend to come up with them and see his father, \"he will be so\r\ndelighted\"; but the old man said he \"would call and see Mr. Earnest some\r\nother time; now he must be hurrying home.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this isn't your way home, Captain Hardy,--is it?\" exclaimed\r\nWilliam, much surprised. \"Why, I thought you lived away down below the\r\nvillage.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did once,\" replied the old man; \"that is, when I lived anywhere\r\nat all; but you see I've got a new home now, and a snug one too. Look\r\ndown there where the smoke curls up among the trees,--that's from my\r\nkitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said William, \"that's Mother Podger's house where the smoke is.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was once, my lad,\" answered the old man; \"but it's mine now; for\r\nI've bought it, and paid for it too; and now I mean to quit roaming\r\nabout the world, and to settle down there for the remainder of my days.\r\nYou must all come down and see me; and, if you do, I'll give you a sail\r\nin my boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, won't that be grand!\" exclaimed William; and Fred and Alice both\r\nsaid it would be \"grand\"; and then they all put a bold front on, and\r\nasked the old man if he wouldn't take them to see the boat now, they\r\nwould like _so_ much to see it.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will,\" answered the old man. \"Come along,\"--and he led the\r\nway over the slope down to the little bay where the boat was lying.\r\n\r\n\"There she is!\" exclaimed he, when the boat came in view. \"Isn't she a\r\nsnug craft? She rides the water just like a duck,\"--whereupon the\r\nchildren all declared that they had never, in all their lives, seen\r\nanything so pretty, and that \"a duck could not ride the water half so\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a very beautiful little boat, or rather yacht, with a\r\ncosey little cabin in the centre, and space enough behind and outside of\r\nit for four persons to sit quite comfortably. The yacht had but one\r\nmast, and was painted white, both inside and out, with only the faintest\r\nred streak running all the way around its sides, just a little way above\r\nthe water-line.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hardy (for that was the old man's proper name and title, and\r\ntherefore we will give it to him) now drew his little yacht close in to\r\na little wharf that he had made, and the children stepped into it, and\r\nran through the cosey cabin, which was but very little higher than their\r\nheads, and had crimson cushions all along its sides to sit down upon.\r\nThese crimson cushions were the lids of what the Captain called his\r\n\"lockers,\"--boxes where he kept his little \"traps.\" In this little cabin\r\nthere was the daintiest little stove, on which the Captain said they\r\nmight cook something when they went out sailing.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished looking at the yacht, they jumped ashore again,\r\nand then, after securing the craft of which he was so proud, the Captain\r\ntook the children to his house. It was a cunning little house, this\r\nhouse of the Captain's. It was only one story high, and it was as white\r\nand clean as a new table-cloth, while the window-shutters were as green\r\nas the grass that grew around it. Tall trees surrounded it on every\r\nside, making shade for the Captain when the sun shone, and music for the\r\nCaptain when the wind blew. In front there was a quaint porch, all\r\ncovered over with honeysuckles, smelling sweet, and near by, in a\r\ncluster of trees, there was a rustic arbor, completely covered up with\r\nvines and flowers. Starting from the front of the house, a path wound\r\namong the trees down to the little bay where lay the yacht; and on the\r\nleft-hand side of this path, as you went down, a spring of pure water\r\ngurgled up into the bright air, underneath a rich canopy of ferns and\r\nwild-flowers.\r\n\r\nWilliam was much surprised to find that this house, which everybody knew\r\nas \"Mother Podger's house,\" should now really belong to Captain Hardy;\r\nand he said so.\r\n\r\n\"You'd hardly know it, would you, since I've fixed it up, and made it\r\nship-shape like?\" said the Captain. \"I've done it nearly all myself too.\r\nAnd now what do you think I've called it?\"\r\n\r\nThe children said they could never guess,--to save their lives, they\r\nnever could.\r\n\r\n\"I call it 'Mariner's Rest,'\" said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"O, how beautiful! and so appropriate!\" exclaimed William; and Fred and\r\nAlice chimed in and said the same.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" went on the Captain, \"You must steer your course for the\r\n'Mariner's Rest' again,--right soon, too, and the old man will be glad\r\nto see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Captain Hardy,\" answered William, with a bow. \"If we get our\r\nparents' leave, we'll come to-morrow, if that will not too much trouble\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not trouble me at all,\" replied the Captain. \"Let it be four\r\no'clock, then,--come at four o'clock. That will suit me perfectly; and\r\nit may be that I'll have,\" continued he, \"a bit of a story or two to\r\ntell you. Besides, I think I promised something of the kind before to\r\nWilliam, when I came home this time twelvemonth ago. Do you remember it,\r\nmy lad?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam said he remembered it well, and his eyes opened wide with\r\npleasure and surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now what is it?\" inquired the Captain, thoughtfully. \"Was it a story\r\nabout the hot regions, or the cold regions? for you see things don't\r\nstick in my memory now as they used to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was about the cold regions, that I'm sure of,\" replied William; \"for\r\nyou said you would tell me the story you told Bob Benton and Dick\r\nSavery,--something, you know, about your being _'cast away in the\r\ncold,'_ as Dick Savery said you called it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, that's it, that's it,\" exclaimed the old man, as if recalling\r\nthe occasion when he had made the promise with much pleasure. \"I\r\nremember it very well. I promised to tell you how I first came to go to\r\nsea, and what happened to me when I got there. Eh? That was it, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was exactly it, only you said you were 'cast away in the cold,'\"\r\nsaid William.\r\n\r\n\"No matter for that, my lad,\" replied the Captain, with a knowing\r\nlook,--\"no matter for that. If you know how a story's going to end, it\r\nspoils the telling of it, don't you see? Consider that I didn't get cast\r\naway, in short, that you know nothing of what happened to me, only that\r\nI went to sea, and leave the rest to turn up as we go along. And now,\r\ngood-day to all of you, my dears. Come down to-morrow, and we'll have\r\nthe story, and maybe a sail, if the wind's fair and weather fine,--at\r\nany rate, the story.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were probably the happiest children that were ever seen, as\r\nthey turned about for home, showering thanks upon the Captain with such\r\ntremendous earnestness that he was forced in self-defence to cry,\r\n\"Enough, enough! run home, and say no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Hardy, Otherwise Ancient Mariner,\r\nOtherwise Old Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN HARDY, or Captain John Hardy, or Captain Jack Hardy, or plain\r\nCaptain Jack, or simple Captain, as his neighbors pleased to name him,\r\nwas a famous character in the village. Everybody knew the captain, and\r\neverybody liked him. He was a mysterious sort of person,--here to-day\r\nand there to-morrow,--coming and going all the time, until he fairly\r\ntired out the public curiosity and people's patience altogether, so that\r\neven the greatest gossips in the town had to confess at length that\r\nthere was no use trying to make anything of Captain Jack, and they\r\nprudently gave up inquiring and bothering their heads about him; but\r\nthey were glad to see him always, none the less.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was known as a great talker, and was always, in former\r\nyears, brimful of stories of adventure to tell to any one he met during\r\nhis short visits to the village,--any one, indeed, who would listen to\r\nhim; and, in truth, everybody was glad to listen, he talked so well.\r\nMany and many a summer evening he spent seated on an old bench in front\r\nof the village inn, reciting tales of shipwrecks, and stories of the sea\r\nand land, to the wondering people. Of late years, however, he was not\r\ndisposed to talk so much, and was not so often seen at his favorite\r\nhaunt. \"I'm getting too old,\" he would say, \"to tarry from home after\r\nnightfall.\"\r\n\r\nHe had now grown to be fifty-nine years old, although he really looked\r\nmuch more aged, for he bore about him the marks of much hardship and\r\nprivation. His hair was quite white, and fell in long silvery locks over\r\nhis shoulders, while a heavy snow-white beard covered his breast. There\r\nwas always something in his appearance denoting the sailor. Perhaps it\r\nwas that he always wore loose pantaloons,--white in summer, and blue in\r\nwinter,--and a sort of tarpaulin hat, with long blue ribbons tied around\r\nit, the ends flowing off behind like the pennant of a man-of-war.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hardy was known to everybody as a generous, warm-hearted, and\r\nharmless man; but he was thought to be equally improvident. The poor had\r\na constant friend in him. No beggar ever asked the Captain for a\r\nshilling without getting it, if the Captain had a shilling anywhere\r\nabout him. Sometimes he had plenty of money, yet when at home he always\r\nlived in a frugal, homely way. Great was the rejoicing therefore, among\r\nhis friends (and they were many), when it was known that he had fallen\r\nin with a streak of good fortune. Having been instrumental in saving the\r\nBritish bark _Dauntless_ from shipwreck, the insurance companies had\r\nawarded him a liberal salvage, and it was to secure this that he had\r\ngone away on his last voyage. As soon as he came home he went right off\r\nand bought the house which we have before described, with the money he\r\nbrought back; and for once got the credit of doing a prudent thing.\r\n\r\nThe old man's happiness seemed now complete. \"Here,\" exclaimed he,\r\n\"Heaven willing, I will bring the old craft to an anchor, and end my\r\ndays in peace.\" But after the excitement of fitting up his house and\r\ngrounds, and getting his little yacht in order, had passed over, he\r\nbegan to feel a little lonely. He was so far away from the village that\r\nhe could not meet his old friends as often as he wished to. We have seen\r\nthat he was a great talker; and he liked so much to talk, and thus to\r\n\"fight his battles over again,\" as it were, and he had so much to talk\r\nabout, that an audience was quite necessary to him. It is not\r\nimprobable, therefore, that he looked upon his meeting with William and\r\nFred and Alice as a fortunate event for him; and if the children were\r\ndelighted, so was he. He was very fond of children, and these were\r\nchildren after his own heart. To them the coming story was a great\r\nevent,--how great the reader could scarcely understand, unless he knew\r\nhow much every boy in Rockdale was envied by all the other boys, big and\r\nlittle, when he was known to have been especially picked out by Captain\r\nHardy to be the listener to some tale of adventure on the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWhich Shows the Old Man To Be a Man of His Word.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we may well suppose, the Captain's little friends did not tarry at\r\nhome next day beyond the appointed time; but true as the hands of the\r\nclock to mark the hour and minute on the dial-plate, they set out for\r\nCaptain Hardy's house as fast as they could go,--as if their very lives\r\ndepended on their speed. They found the Captain seated in the shady\r\narbor, smoking a long clay pipe. \"I'm glad to see you, children,\" was\r\nhis greeting to them; and glad enough he was too,--much more glad,\r\nmaybe, than he would care to own,--as glad, perhaps, as the children\r\nwere themselves.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dears,\" continued he, \"shall we have the story? There is no\r\nwind, you see, so we cannot have a sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, the story! yes, yes, the story,\" cried the children, all at once.\r\n\r\n\"Then the story it shall be,\" replied the old man; \"but first you must\r\nsit down,\"--and the children sat down upon the rustic seat, and closed\r\ntheir mouths, and opened wide their ears, prepared to listen; while the\r\nCaptain knocked the ashes from his long clay pipe, and stuck it in the\r\nrafter overhead, and clearing up his throat, prepared to talk.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must know,\" began the Captain, \"that I cannot finish the story\r\nI'm going to tell you all in one day,--indeed, I can only just begin it.\r\nIt's a very long one, so you must come down to-morrow, and next day,\r\nand every bright day after that until we've done. Does that please you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" was the ready answer, and little Alice laughed loud with\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be sure to remember the name of the place you come to? Will\r\nyou remember that its name is 'Mariner's Rest'? Will you remember that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed we will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now for the boat we're to have a sail in by and by; what do you\r\nthink I've called that?\" asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Sea-Gull?\" guessed William.\r\n\r\n\"Water-Witch?\" guessed Fred.\r\n\r\n\"White Dove?\" guessed Alice.\r\n\r\n\"All wrong,\" said the Captain, smiling a smile of the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. \"I've painted the name on her in bright golden letters,\r\nand when you go down again to look at her, you'll see _Alice_ there, and\r\nthe letters are just the color of some little girl's hair I know of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that really her name?\" shouted both the boys at once, glad as they\r\ncould be; \"how jolly!\" But little Alice said never a word, but crept\r\nclose to the old man's side, and the old man put his great, big arm\r\naround the child's small body, and as the soft sunlight came stealing in\r\nthrough the openings in the foliage of the trees, flinging patches of\r\nbrightness here and there upon the grass around, the Captain began his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my little listeners,\" spoke the Captain, \"you must know that what\r\nI am going to tell you occurred to me at a very early period of my life,\r\nwhen I was a mere boy; in fact, the adventures which I shall now relate\r\nto you were the first I ever had.\r\n\r\n\"To begin, then, at the very beginning, I must tell you that I was born\r\nquite near Rockdale. So you see I have good reason for always liking to\r\ncome back here. It is like coming home, you know. The place of my birth\r\nis only eleven miles from Rockdale by the public road, which runs off\r\nthere in a west-nor'westerly direction.\r\n\r\n\"My mother died when I was six years old, but I remember her as a good\r\nand gentle woman. She was taken away, however, too early to have left\r\nany distinct impression upon my mind or character. I was thus left to\r\ngrow up with three brothers and two sisters, all but one of whom were\r\nolder than myself, without a mother's kindly care and instruction; and I\r\nmust here own, that I grew to be a self-willed and obstinate boy; and\r\nthis disposition led me into a course of disobedience which, but for the\r\nprotecting care of a merciful Providence, would have brought my life to\r\na speedy end.\r\n\r\n\"My father being poor, neither myself nor my brothers and sisters\r\nreceived any other education than what was afforded by the common\r\ncountry school. It was, indeed, as much as my father could do at any\r\ntime to support so large a family, and, at the end of the year, make\r\nboth ends meet.\r\n\r\n\"As for myself, I was altogether a very ungrateful fellow, and\r\nappreciated neither the goodness of my father nor any of the other\r\nblessings which I had. Of the advantages of a moderate education which\r\nwere offered to me I did not avail myself,--preferring mischief and\r\nidleness to my studies; and I manifested so little desire to learn, and\r\nwas so troublesome to the master, that I was at length sent home, and\r\nforbidden to come back any more; whereupon my father, very naturally,\r\ngrew angry with me, and no doubt thinking it hopeless to try further to\r\nmake anything of me, he regularly bound me over, or hired me out, for a\r\nperiod of years, to a neighboring farmer, who compelled me to work very\r\nhard; so I thought myself ill used, whereas, in truth, I did not receive\r\nhalf my deserts.\r\n\r\n\"With this farmer I lived three years and a half before he made the\r\ndiscovery that I was wholly useless to him, and that I did not do work\r\nenough to pay for the food I ate; so the farmer complained to my father,\r\nand threatened to send me home. This made me very indignant, as I\r\nfoolishly thought myself a greatly abused and injured person, and, in an\r\nevil hour, I resolved to stand it no longer. I would spite the old\r\nfarmer, and punish my father for listening to him, by running away.\r\n\r\n\"I was now in my eighteenth year,--old enough, as one would have\r\nthought, to have more manliness and self-respect; but about this I had\r\nnot reflected much.\r\n\r\n\"I set out on my ridiculous journey without one pang of regret,--so\r\nhardened was I in heart and conscience,--carrying with me only a change\r\nof clothing, and having in my pocket only one small piece of bread, and\r\ntwo small pieces of silver. It was rather a bold adventure, but I\r\nthought I should have no difficulty in reaching New Bedford, where I was\r\nfully resolved to take ship and go to sea.\r\n\r\n\"The journey to New Bedford was a much more difficult undertaking than I\r\nhad counted upon, and, I believe, but for the wound which it would have\r\ncaused to my pride, I should have gone back at the end of the first five\r\nmiles. I held on, however, and reached my destination on the second day,\r\nhaving stopped overnight at a public house or inn, where my two pieces\r\nof silver disappeared in paying for my supper and lodging and\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\"I arrived at New Bedford near the middle of the afternoon of the second\r\nday, very hot and dusty, for I had walked all the way through the\r\nbroiling sun along the high-road; and I was very tired and hungry, too,\r\nfor I had tasted no food since morning, having no more money to buy any\r\nwith, and not liking to beg. So I wandered on through the town towards\r\nthe place where the masts of ships were to be seen as I looked down the\r\nstreet,--feeling miserable enough, I can assure you.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this period of my life, I had never been ten miles from home, and\r\nhad never seen a city, so of course everything was new to me. By this\r\ntime, however, I had come to reflect seriously on my folly, and this,\r\ncoupled with hunger and fatigue, so far banished curiosity from my mind\r\nthat I was not in the least impressed by what I saw. In truth, I very\r\nheartily wished myself back on the farm; for if the labor there was not\r\nto my liking, it was at least not so hard as what I had performed these\r\npast two days, in walking along the dusty road,--and then I was, when on\r\nthe farm, never without the means to satisfy my hunger.\r\n\r\n\"What I should have done at this critical stage, had not some one come\r\nto my assistance, I cannot imagine. I was afraid to ask any questions of\r\nthe passers-by, for I did not really know what to ask them, or how to\r\nexplain my situation; and, seeing that everybody was gaping at me with\r\nwonder and curiosity (and many of them were clearly laughing at my\r\nabsurd appearance), I hurried on, not having the least idea of where I\r\nshould go or what I should do.\r\n\r\n\"At length I saw a man with a very red face approaching on the opposite\r\nside of the street, and from his general appearance I guessed him to be\r\na sailor; so, driven almost to desperation, I crossed over to him,\r\nlooking, I am sure, the very picture of despair, and I thus accosted\r\nhim: 'If you please, sir, can you tell me where I can go and ship for a\r\nvoyage?'\r\n\r\n\"'A voyage!' shouted he, in reply, 'a voyage! A pretty looking fellow\r\nyou for a voyage!'--which observation very much confused me. Then he\r\nasked me a great many questions, using a great many hard names, the\r\nmeaning of which I did not at all understand, and the necessity for\r\nwhich I could not exactly see. I noticed that he called me 'landlubber'\r\nvery frequently, but I had no idea whether he meant to compliment or\r\nabuse me, though it seemed more likely to me that it was the latter.\r\nAfter a while, however, he seemed to have grown tired of talking, or had\r\nexhausted all his strange words, for he turned short round and bade me\r\nfollow him, which I did, with very much the feelings a culprit must have\r\nwhen he is going to prison.\r\n\r\n\"We went down a steep hill, and arrived presently at a low, dingy place,\r\nthe only peculiar feature of which was that it smelled of tar and had a\r\ngreat many people lounging about in it. It was, as I soon found out, a\r\n'shipping office,'--that is, a place where sailors engage themselves for\r\na voyage. No sooner had we entered than my conductor led me up to a tall\r\ndesk, and then, addressing himself to a sharp-faced man on the other\r\nside of it, he said something which I did not clearly comprehend. Then I\r\nwas told to sign a paper, which I did without even reading a word of it,\r\nand then the red-faced man cried out in a very loud and startling tone\r\nof voice, 'Bill!' when somebody at once rolled off a bench, and\r\nscrambled to his feet. This was evidently the 'Bill' alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"When Bill had got upon his feet, he surveyed me for an instant, as I\r\nthought, with a very needlessly firm expression of countenance, and then\r\nstarted towards the door, saying to me as he set off, 'This way, you\r\nlubber.' I followed after him with much the same feelings which I had\r\nbefore when I followed the man with the red face, until we came down to\r\nwhere the ships were, and then we descended a sort of ladder, or stairs,\r\nat the foot of which I stumbled into a boat, and had like to have gone\r\noverboard into the water. At this, the people in the boat set up a great\r\nlaugh at my clumsiness,--just as if I had ever been in a boat before,\r\nand could help being clumsy. To make the matter worse, I sat down in the\r\nwrong place, where one of the men was to pull an oar; and when, after\r\nbeing told to 'get out of that,' with no end of hard names, I asked what\r\nbench I should sit on, they all laughed louder than before, which still\r\nfurther overwhelmed me with confusion. I did not then know that what I\r\ncalled a 'bench,' they called a 'thwart,' or more commonly 'thawt.'\r\n\r\n\"At length, after much abuse and more laughter, I managed to get into\r\nthe forward part of the boat, which was called, as I found out, 'the\r\nbows,' where there was barely room to coil myself up, and the boat being\r\nsoon pushed off from the wharf, the oars were put out, and then I heard\r\nan order to 'give way,' and then the oars splashed in the water, and I\r\nfelt the boat moving; and now, as I realized that I was in truth leaving\r\nmy home and native land, perhaps to see them no more forever, my heart\r\nsank heavy in my breast; and it was as much as I could do to keep the\r\ntears from pouring out of my eyes, as we glided on over the harbor.\r\nIndeed, my eyes were so bedimmed that I scarcely saw anything at all\r\nuntil we came around under the stern of a ship, when I heard the order\r\n'lay in your oars.' Then one of the men caught hold of the end of a\r\nrope, which was thrown from the ship; and, the boat being made fast, we\r\nall scrambled up the ship's side; and then I was hustled along to a hole\r\nin the forward part of the deck (having what looked like a box turned\r\nupside down over it), through which, now utterly bewildered, I\r\ndescended, by means of a ladder, to a dark, damp, mouldy place, which\r\nwas filled with the foul smells of tar and bilge-water, and thick with\r\ntobacco-smoke. This, they told me, was the 'fo'casle,' that is,\r\nforecastle, where lived the 'crew,' of which I became now painfully\r\nconscious that I was one. If there had been the slightest chance, I\r\nshould have run away; but running away from a ship is a very different\r\nthing from running away from a farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Romance of the Sea.]\r\n\r\n\"If I had wished myself back on the farm before, how much more did I\r\nwish it now! But too late, too late, for we were all ordered up out of\r\nthe forecastle even before I had tasted a mouthful of food. In truth,\r\nhowever, it is very likely that I was too sick with the foul odors,\r\ntobacco-smoke, and heart-burnings to have eaten anything, even had it\r\nbeen set before me.\r\n\r\n\"Upon reaching the deck, I was immediately ordered to lay hold of a\r\nwooden shaft, about six feet long, which ran through the end of an iron\r\nlever; and being joined by some more of the crew, we pushed down and\r\nlifted up this lever, just like firemen working an old-fashioned\r\nfire-engine. Opposite to us was another party pushing down when we were\r\nlifting up, and lifting up when we were pushing down. I soon found out\r\nthat by this operation we were turning over and over what seemed to be a\r\ngreat log of wood, with iron bands at the ends of it, and having a great\r\nchain winding up around it. The chain came in through a round hole in\r\nthe ship's side, with a loud 'click, click,' and I learned that they\r\ncalled it a 'cable,' while the machine we were working was called a\r\n'windlass.' The cable was of course fast to the anchor, and it was very\r\nevident to me that we were going to put to sea immediately. The idea of\r\nit was now as dreadful to me as it had before been agreeable, when I had\r\ncontemplated it from the stand-point of a quiet farm, a good many miles\r\naway from the sea. But I could not help myself. No matter what might\r\nhappen, my fate was sealed, so far as concerned this ship.\r\n\r\n\"We had not been long engaged at this work of turning the windlass,\r\nbefore my companions set up a song, keeping time with the lever which we\r\nwere pushing up and down, one of them leading off by reciting a single\r\nline, in which something was said about Sallie coming, or having come,\r\nor going to come to 'New York town'; after which they all united in a\r\ndismal chorus, that had not a particle of sense in it, so far as I could\r\nsee, from beginning to end. When they had finished off with the chorus,\r\nthe leader set to screaming again about 'Sallie' and 'New York town,'\r\nand then as before came the chorus. Having completely exhausted himself\r\non the subject of Sallie, he began to invent, and his inventive genius\r\nwas rewarded with a laugh which interfered with the chorus through about\r\ntwo turns of the windlass. What he invented I will recite, that you may\r\nsee how senseless it was; and I will drawl it out very slow to imitate\r\nthem. But first let me say, when they were through with this chorus, the\r\nleader put in his tongue again, inventing a sentiment to rhyme with the\r\nfirst, howling it out as if he would split his throat in the endeavor.\r\nThis is what it all was:--\r\n\r\n'We've picked up a lubber in New Bedford town,--\r\nCome away, away, sto-r-m along, John,\r\nGet a-long, storm a-long, storm's g-one along,'\r\n\r\n'Our lubber's lugger-rigged, and we'll do him brown,--\r\nCome away, away, sto-r-m along, John,\r\nGet a-long, storm a-long, storm's g-one along.'\r\n\r\n\"The last sentiment about lugger-rigged lubber being done brown made them\r\nall laugh even more than the other, and caused an interruption of the\r\nchorus to the extent of at least four revolutions of the windlass; but\r\nwhen the laugh was over, they went at the dismal chorus with double the\r\nenergy they had shown before, repeating all they had then said about\r\n'John's getting along,' and 'storming along,' as if they rather liked\r\nJohn for doing these things. Thus they went on without much variety,\r\nuntil I was sick and tired enough of it. The 'lubber' part of it was too\r\nclearly aimed at me to be mistaken; but I could not discover in it\r\nanything but nonsense all the way through to the end.\r\n\r\n\"After a while I heard some one cry out, 'The anchor's away,' which as I\r\nafterwards learned, meant the anchor had been lifted from the bottom;\r\nand then the sailors all scattered to obey an order to do something,\r\nwhich I had not the least idea of, with a sail, and with some ropes,\r\nwhich appeared to me to be so mixed up that nobody could tell one from\r\nthe other, nor make head nor tail of them. In the twinkling of an eye,\r\nhowever, in spite of the mixed-up ropes, there was a great flapping of\r\nwhite canvas, and a creaking and rattling of pulleys. Then the huge\r\nwhite sail was fully spread, the wind was bulging it out in the middle\r\nlike a balloon, the ship's head was turned away from the town, and we\r\nwere moving off. Next came an order to 'lay aloft and shake out the\r\ntopsail'; but happily in this order I was not included, but was,\r\ninstead, directed to 'lend a hand to get the anchor aboard,' which\r\noperation was quickly accomplished, and the heavy mass of crooked iron\r\nwhich had held the ship firmly in the harbor was soon fastened in its\r\nproper place on the bow, to what is called a 'cat-head.' By the time\r\nthis was done, every sail was set, and we were flying before the wind\r\nout into the great ocean.\r\n\r\n\"And now you see my wish was gratified. I was in a ship and off on the\r\n'world of waters,' with the career of a sailor before me,--a career to\r\nmy imagination when on the farm full of romance, and presenting\r\neverything that was desirable in life. But was it so in reality when I\r\nwas brought face to face with it,--when I had exchanged the farm for the\r\nforecastle? By no means. Indeed, I was filled with nothing but disgust\r\nfirst, and terror afterwards. The first sight which I had of the ocean\r\nwas much less satisfactory to me than would have been my father's\r\nduck-pond. I soon got miserably sick; night came on, dark and fearful;\r\nthe winds rose; the waves dashed with great force against the ship's\r\nsides, often breaking over the deck, and wetting me to the skin. I was\r\nshivering with cold; I was afraid that I should be washed overboard; I\r\nwas afraid that I should be killed by something tumbling on me from\r\naloft, for there was such a great rattling up there in the darkness that\r\nI thought everything was broken loose. I could not stand on the deck\r\nwithout support, and was knocked about when I attempted to move; every\r\ntime the ship went down into the trough of a sea I thought all my\r\ninsides were coming up. So, altogether, you see I was in a very bad way.\r\nHow, indeed, should it be otherwise? for can you imagine any ills so\r\ngreat as these?\r\n\r\n    1st, To have all your clothes wet;\r\n    2d, To have a sick stomach; and,\r\n    3d, To be in a dreadful fright.\r\n\r\n\"Now that was precisely my condition; and I was already reaping the\r\nfruits of my folly in running away from home and exchanging a farm for a\r\nforecastle.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Captain here paused and laughed heartily at the picture he had drawn\r\nof himself in his ridiculous _rôle_ of \"the young sailor-boy,\" and,\r\nafter clearing his throat again, was about to proceed with the story,\r\nwhen he perceived that the shades of evening had already begun to fall\r\nupon the arbor. Looking out among the trees, he saw the leaves and\r\nbranches standing sharply out against the golden sky, which showed him\r\nthat the day was ended and the sun was set. So he told his little\r\nfriends to hasten home before the dews began to fall upon the grass, and\r\ncome again next day. This they promised thankfully, and told the Captain\r\nthat they \"never, never, never would forget it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the head of William was filled with a bright idea, and he was bound\r\nto discharge it before he left the place. \"O Captain Hardy,\" cried the\r\nlittle fellow, \"do you know what I was thinking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I, before you tell me?\" was the Captain's very natural\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I was thinking how nice it would be to write all this down on\r\npaper. It would read just like a printed book.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain said he \"liked the idea,\" but he doubted if William could\r\nremember it. But William thought he could remember every word of it, and\r\ndeclared that it was splendid; and Fred and Alice, following after, said\r\nthat it was splendid too. But whether the story that the Captain told\r\nwas splendid, or the idea of writing it down was splendid, or exactly\r\nwhat was splendid, was not then and there settled; yet it was fully\r\nsettled that William was to write the story down the best he could, and\r\nask his father to correct the worst mistakes. And now, when this was\r\ndone, the happy children said \"Good evening\" to the Captain, and set out\r\nmerrily for home, little Alice holding to her brother's hand, as she\r\ntripped lightly over the green field, turning every dozen steps to throw\r\nback through the tender evening air, from her dainty little fingertips,\r\na laughing kiss to the ancient mariner, whose face beamed kindly on her\r\nfrom the arbor door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe Old Man, having related to the Little People how\r\nthe Young Man went to Sea, now proceeds to tell\r\nwhat the Young Man did there.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two days which the old man and his young friends had passed together\r\nhad so completely broken down all restraint between them, that the\r\nchildren almost felt as if they had known the old man all their lives.\r\nIt was therefore quite natural, that, when they went down next day, they\r\nshould feel inclined to give him a surprise. So they concerted a plan of\r\nsneaking quietly around the house that they might come upon him\r\nsuddenly, for they saw him working in his garden, hoeing up the weeds.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's astonish him,\" said William.\r\n\r\n\"That's a jolly idea,\" said Fred, while Alice said nothing at all, but\r\nwas as pleased as she could be.\r\n\r\nThe little party crawled noiselessly along the fence, through the open\r\ngate, and sprang upon the Captain with a yell, like a parcel of wild\r\nIndians; and sure enough they did surprise him, for he jumped behind his\r\nhoe, as if preparing to defend himself against an attack of enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Heyday, my hearties!\" exclaimed the Captain, when he saw who was there.\r\n\"Ain't you ashamed of yourselves to scare the old man that way?\" and he\r\njoined the laugh that the children raised at his own expense,--enjoying\r\nit as much as they did.\r\n\r\n\"That's a trick of William's, I'll be bound,\" said he; \"but no matter,\r\nI'll forgive you; and I'm right glad you've come, too, for it's precious\r\nhot, and I'm tired hoeing up the weeds; so now, let us get out of the\r\nsun, into the crow's nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crow's nest!\" cried William. \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the arbor, to be sure,\" said the Captain. \"Don't you like the\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" answered William. \"It's such a cunning name.\"\r\n\r\nIt was but a few steps to the \"crow's nest,\" and the happy party once\r\nseated, the Captain was ready in an instant to pick up the thread where\r\nhe had broken it short off when they had parted in the golden evening of\r\nthe day before, and then to spin on the yarn.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my lively trickster and genius of the quill,\" said he to\r\nWilliam, \"how is it about writing down the story? What does your father\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" answered William, \"I've written down almost every word of what you\r\nsaid, and papa has examined it, and says he likes it. There it is\";--and\r\nhe pulled a roll of paper from his pocket and handed it to the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe old man took it from William's hand, looking all the while much\r\ngratified; and after pulling out a pair of curious-looking,\r\nold-fashioned spectacles from a curious-looking, old-fashioned\r\nred-morocco case, which was much the worse for wear, he fixed them on\r\nhis nose very carefully, and then, after unfolding the sheets of paper,\r\nhe glanced knowingly over them.\r\n\r\n\"That's good,\" said he; \"that's ship-shape, and as it ought to be. Why,\r\nlad, you're a regular genius, and sure to turn out a second Scott, or\r\nCooper, or some such writing chap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you like it, Captain Hardy,\" said William, pleased that he\r\nhad pleased his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Like it!\" exclaimed the Captain. \"Like it!! that's just _what_ I do;\r\nand now, since I'm to be made famous in this way, I'll be more careful\r\nwith my speech. And no bad spelling either,\" ran on the Captain, while\r\nhe kept turning back the leaves, \"as there would have been if you had\r\nput it down just as I spoke it. But never mind that now; take back the\r\npapers, lad, and keep them safe; we'll go on now, if we can only find\r\nwhere the yarn was broken yesterday. Do any of you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said William, laughing. \"You had just got out into the great\r\nocean, and were frightened half to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, that's it,\" went on the Captain,--\"frightened half to death;\r\nthat's sure enough, and no mistake; and so would you have been, my lad,\r\nif you had been in my place. But I don't think I'll tell you anything\r\nmore about my miserable life on board that ship. Hadn't we better skip\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, no!\" cried the children all together, \"don't skip anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the obliging Captain, glad enough to see how much his\r\nyoung friends were interested, \"if you _will_ know what sort of a\r\nmiserable time young sailors have of it, I'll tell you; and let me tell\r\nyou, too, there's many a one of them has just as bad a time as I had.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, you see, they gave me such wretched food to eat,\r\nall out of a rusty old tin plate, and I was all the time so sick from\r\nthe motion of the vessel as we went tossing up and down on the rough\r\nsea, and from the tobacco-smoke of the forecastle, and all the other bad\r\nsmells, that I could hardly eat a mouthful, so that I was half ready to\r\ndie of starvation; and, as if this was not misery enough, the sailors\r\nwere all the time, when in the forecastle, quarrelling like so many wild\r\nbeasts in a cage; and as two of them had pistols, and all of them had\r\nknives, I was every minute in dread lest they should take it into their\r\nheads to murder each other, and kill me by mistake. So, I can tell you,\r\nbeing a young sailor-boy isn't what it's cracked up to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, wasn't it dreadful!\" said Alice, \"to be sick all the time, and\r\nnobody there to take care of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wasn't so sick, maybe, after all,\" answered the Captain,\r\nsmiling,--\"only _sea-sick_, you know; and then, for the credit of the\r\nship, I'll say that, if you had nice plum-pudding every day for dinner,\r\nyou would think it horrid stuff if you were sea-sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't people die when they are sea-sick?\" inquired Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Not often, child,\" answered the Captain, playfully; \"but they feel all\r\nthe time as if they were going to, and when they don't feel that way,\r\nthey feel as if they'd like to.\r\n\r\n\"However, I was miserable enough in more ways than one; for to these\r\ntroubles was added a great distress of mind, caused by the sport the\r\nsailors made of me, and also by remorse of conscience for having run\r\naway from home, and thus got myself into this great scrape. Then, to\r\nmake the matter worse,--as if it was not bad enough already,--a violent\r\nstorm set upon us in the dark night. You could never imagine how the\r\nship rolled about over the waves. Sometimes they swept clear across the\r\nship, as if threatening our lives; and all the time the creaking of the\r\nmasts, the roaring of the wind through the rigging, and the lashing of\r\nthe seas, filled my ears with such awful sounds that I was in the\r\ngreatest terror, and I thought that every moment would certainly be my\r\nlast. Then, as if still further to add to my fears, one of the sailors\r\ntold me, right in the midst of the storm, that we were bound for the\r\nNorthern seas, to catch whales and seals. So now, what little scrap of\r\ncourage I had left took instant flight, and I fell at once to praying\r\n(which I am ashamed to say I had never in my life done before), fully\r\nsatisfied as I was that, if this course did not save me, nothing would.\r\nIn truth, I believe I should actually have died of fright had not the\r\nstorm come soon to an end; and indeed it was many days before I got over\r\nthinking that I should, in one way or another, have a speedy passage\r\ninto the next world, and therefore I did not much concern myself with\r\nwhere we were going in this. Hence I grew to be very unpopular with the\r\npeople in the ship, and learned next to nothing. I was always in\r\nsomebody's way, was always getting hold of the wrong rope, and was in\r\ntruth all the time doing mischief rather than good. So I was set down as\r\na hopeless idiot, and was considered proper game for everybody. The\r\nsailors tormented me in every possible way.\r\n\r\n\"One day (knowing how green I was) they set to talking about fixing up a\r\ntable in the forecastle, and one of them said, 'What a fine thing it\r\nwould be if the mate (who turned out to be the red-faced man I had met\r\nin the street, and who took me to the shipping-office) would only let us\r\nhave the keelson.' So this being agreed to in a very serious manner\r\n(which I hadn't wit enough to see was all put on), I was sent to carry\r\ntheir petition. Seeing the mate on the quarter-deck, I approached, and\r\nin a very respectful manner thus addressed him: 'If you please, sir, I\r\ncome to ask if you will let us have the keelson for a table?' Whereupon\r\nthe mate turned fiercely upon me, and, to my great astonishment, roared\r\nout at the very top of his voice, 'What! what's that you say? Say that\r\nagain, will you?' So I repeated the question as he had told me\r\nto,--feeling all the while as if I should like the deck to open and\r\nswallow me up. I had scarcely finished before I perceived that the mate\r\nwas growing more and more angry; if, indeed, anything could possibly\r\nexceed the passion he was in already. His face was many shades redder\r\nthan it was before,--and, indeed, it was so very red that it looked as\r\nif it might shine in the dark. His hat fell off, as it seemed to me, in\r\nconsequence of his stiff red hair rising up on end, and he raised his\r\nvoice so loud that it sounded more like the howl of a wild beast than\r\nanything I could compare it to. 'You lubber!' he shouted. 'You villain!'\r\nhe shrieked; 'you, you!'--and here it seemed as if he was choking with\r\nhard words which he couldn't get rid of,--'you come here to play tricks\r\non me! You try to fool me! I'll teach you!'--and, seizing hold of the\r\nfirst thing he could lay his hands on (I did not stop to see what it\r\nwas, but wheeled about greatly terrified), he let fly at me with such\r\nviolence that I am sure I must have been finished off for certain had I\r\nnot quickly dodged my head. When I returned to the forecastle, the\r\nsailors had a great laugh at me, and they called me ever afterwards\r\n'Jack Keelson.' The keelson, you must know, is a great mass of wood\r\ndown in the very bottom of the ship, running the whole length of it; but\r\nhow should I have learned that?\r\n\r\n\"At another time I was told to go and 'grease the saddle.' Not knowing\r\nthat this was a block of wood spiked to the mainmast to support the main\r\nboom, and thinking this a trick too, I refused to go, and came again\r\nnear getting my head broken by the red-faced mate. I did not believe\r\nthere was anything like a 'saddle' in the ship.\r\n\r\n\"And thus the sailors continued to worry me. Once, when I was very weak\r\nwith sea-sickness and wanted to keep down a dinner which I had just\r\neaten, they insisted upon it, that, if I would only put into my mouth a\r\npiece of fat pork, and _keep it there_, my dinner would stay in its\r\nplace. The sailors were right enough, for as soon as my dinner began to\r\nstart up, of course away went the fat pork out ahead of it.\r\n\r\n\"But by and by I came to my senses, and, upon discovering that the bad\r\nusage I received was partly my own fault, I stopped lamenting over my\r\nunhappy condition, and began to show more spirit. Would you believe it?\r\nI had actually been in the vessel five days before I had curiosity\r\nenough to inquire her name. They told me that it was called the\r\n_Blackbird_; but what ever possessed anybody to give it such a\r\nridiculous name I never could imagine. If they had called it Black Duck,\r\nor Black Diver, there would have been some sense in it, for the ship was\r\ndriving head foremost into the water pretty much all the time. But I\r\nfound out that the vessel was not exactly a ship after all, but a sort\r\nof half schooner, half brig,--what they call a brigantine, having two\r\nmasts, a mainmast and a foremast. On the former there was a sail running\r\nfore and aft, just like the sail of the little yacht _Alice_, and on\r\nthe latter there was a foresail, a foretop-sail, a foretop-gallant-sail,\r\nand a fore-royal-sail,--all of course square sails, that is, running\r\nacross the vessel, and fastened to what are called yards. The vessel was\r\npainted jet-black on the outside, but inside the bulwarks the color was\r\na dirty sort of green.\r\n\r\n\"Such, as nearly I can remember, was the brigantine _Blackbird_, three\r\nhundred and forty-two tons register. Brigantine is, however, too large a\r\nword; so when we pay the _Blackbird_ the compliment of mentioning her,\r\nwe will call her a ship.\r\n\r\n\"Having picked up the name of the ship, I was tempted to pursue my\r\ninquiries further, and it was not long before I had got quite a\r\nrespectable stock of seaman's knowledge, and hence I grew in favor. I\r\nlearned to distinguish between a 'halyard,' which is rope for pulling\r\nthe yards up and letting them down, from a 'brace,' which is used to\r\npull them around so as to 'trim the sails,' and a 'sheet,' which is a\r\nrope for keeping the sails in their proper places. I found out that what\r\nI called a floor the sailors called a 'deck'; a kitchen they called a\r\n'galley'; a pot, a 'copper'; a pulley was a 'block'; a post was a\r\n'stancheon'; to fall down was to 'heel over'; to climb up was to 'go\r\naloft'; and to walk straight, and keep one's balance when the ship was\r\npitching over the waves, was to 'get your sea legs on.' I found out,\r\ntoo, that everything behind you was 'abaft,' and everything ahead was\r\n'forwards,' or for'ad as the sailors say; that a large rope was a\r\n'hawser,' and that every other rope was a 'line'; to make anything\r\ntemporarily secure was to 'belay' it; to make one thing fast to another\r\nwas to 'bend it on'; and when two things were close together, they were\r\n'chock-a-block.' I learned, also, that the right-hand side of the vessel\r\nwas the 'starboard' side, while the left-hand side was the 'port' or\r\n'larboard' side; that the lever which moves the rudder that steers the\r\nship was called the 'helm,' and that to steer the ship was to take 'a\r\ntrick at the wheel'; that to 'put the helm up' was to turn it in the\r\ndirection from which the wind was coming (windward), and to 'put the\r\nhelm down' was to turn it in the direction the wind was going (leeward).\r\nI found out still further, that a ship has a 'waist,' like a woman, a\r\n'forefoot,' like a beast, besides 'bull's eyes' (which are small holes\r\nwith glass in them to admit light), and 'cat-heads,' and 'monkey-rails,'\r\nand 'cross-trees,' as well as 'saddles' and 'bridles' and 'harness,' and\r\nmany other things which I thought I should never hear anything more of\r\nafter I left the farm. I might go on and tell you a great many more\r\nthings that I learned, but I should only tire your patience without\r\ndoing any good. I only want to show you how John Hardy began his marine\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\"When it was discovered how much I had improved, they proposed\r\nimmediately to turn it to their own account; for I was at once sent to\r\ntake 'a trick at the wheel,' from which I came away, after two hours'\r\nhard work, with my hands dreadfully blistered, and my legs bruised, and\r\nwith the recollection of much abusive language from the red-faced mate,\r\nwho could never see anything right in what I did. I gave him, however,\r\nsome good reason this time to abuse me, and I was glad of it afterwards,\r\nthough I was badly enough scared at the time. I steered the ship so\r\nbadly that a wave which I ought to have avoided by a skilful turn of the\r\nwheel, came breaking in right over the quarter-deck, wetting the mate\r\nfrom head to foot. He thought I did it on purpose (which you may be sure\r\nI did not do). Again his face grew red enough to shine of a dark night,\r\nand his mind invented hard words faster than his tongue would let them\r\nout of his ugly throat.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you all this, that you may have some idea of what a ship is, and\r\nhow sailors live, and what they have to do. You can easily see that they\r\nhave no easy time of it, and, let me tell you, there isn't a bit of\r\nromance about it, except the stories that are cut out of whole cloth to\r\nmake books and songs of. However, I never could have much sympathy for\r\nmy shipmates in the _Blackbird_; for if they did treat me a little\r\nbetter when they found that I could do something, especially when I\r\ncould take a trick at the wheel, I still continued to look upon them as\r\nlittle better than a set of pirates, and I felt satisfied that, if they\r\nwere not born to be hanged, they would certainly drown.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll be a sailor,\" said Fred.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I either,\" said William. \"But, Captain,\" continued the cunning\r\nfellow, \"if a sailor's life is so miserable, what do you go to sea so\r\nmuch for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, my lad,\" replied the Captain, evidently at first a little\r\npuzzled, \"that's a question that would require more time to explain than\r\nwe have to devote to it to-day. Besides\" (he was fully recovered now),\r\n\"you know that going to sea in the cabin is as different from going to\r\nsea in the forecastle as you are from a Yahoo Indian. But never mind\r\nthat, I must get on with my story, or it will never come to an end. I've\r\nhardly begun it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIn which the Ancient Mariner, continuing his Story,\r\nborrows an Illustration from the \"Ancient Mariner\"\r\nof Song, and then proceeds to tell how they\r\nwent into the Cold, and were cast away there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'And now there came both mist and snow,\r\nAnd it grew wondrous cold:\r\nAnd ice mast-high came floating by,\r\nAs green as emerald.'\r\n\r\n\"I recite this from a famous poem because it suits so well what came of\r\nus, for you must understand that, while all I have been telling you was\r\ngoing on, we were approaching the northern regions, and were getting\r\ninto the sea where ice was to be expected. A man was accordingly kept\r\naloft all the time to look out for it: for you will remember that we\r\nwere going after seals, and it is on the ice that the seals are found.\r\nThe weather now became very cold, it being the month of April.\r\n\r\n\"At length the man aloft cried out that he saw ice. 'Where away?'\r\nshouted the red-faced mate. 'Off the larboard bow,' was the answer. So\r\nthe course of the ship was changed, and we bore right down upon the ice,\r\nand very soon it was in sight from the deck, and gradually became more\r\nand more distinct. It was a very imposing sight. The sea was covered all\r\nover with it, as far as the eye could reach,--a great plain of\r\nwhiteness, against the edge of which the waves were breaking and sending\r\nthe spray flying high in the air and sending to our ears that same\r\ndull, heavy roar which the breakers make when beating on the land.\r\n\r\n\"As we neared this novel scene, I observed that it consisted mostly of\r\nflat masses of ice, of various sizes (called by the sealers 'floes');\r\nsome were miles in extent, and others only a few feet. The surface of\r\nthese ice floes or fields rose only about a foot or so above the surface\r\nof the water. Between them there were in many places very broad\r\nopenings, and when I went aloft and looked ahead, these ice-fields\r\nappeared like a great collection of large and small flat white islands,\r\ndotted about in the midst of the ocean. Through these openings between\r\nthe fields the ship was immediately steered, and we were soon surrounded\r\nby ice on every side. To the south, whence we had come, there was in an\r\nhour or so apparently just as much ice as there was before us to the\r\nnorth, or to the right and left of us,--a vast immeasurable waste of ice\r\nit was, looking dreary and frightful enough, I can assure you.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that the pieces of ice now about us were called 'floes,' or\r\nice-fields; the whole together was called 'the pack.' We were now in\r\nperfectly smooth water, for you will easily understand that the ice\r\nwhich we had passed broke the swell of the sea. But the crew of the ship\r\ndid not give themselves much concern about the ice itself; for it was\r\nsoon discovered that the floes were covered in many places with seals.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must understand that seals are not fish, but are air-breathing,\r\nwarm-blooded animals, like horses and cows, and therefore they must\r\nalways have their heads, or at least their noses, out of water when they\r\nbreathe. When the weather is cold, they remain in the water all the\r\ntime, merely putting up their noses now and then (for they can remain a\r\nlong time under water without breathing) to sniff a little fresh air,\r\nand then going quickly down again. In the warm weather, however, they\r\ncome up bodily out of the sea, and bask and go to sleep in the sun,\r\neither on the land or on the ice. Many thousands of them are often seen\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"As we came farther and farther into the 'pack,' the seals on the ice\r\nwere observed to be more and more numerous. Most of them appeared to be\r\nsound asleep; some of them were wriggling about, or rolling themselves\r\nover and over, while none of them seemed to have the least idea that we\r\nhad come all the way from New Bedford to rob them of their sleek coats\r\nand their nice fat blubber.\r\n\r\n\"We were now fairly into our 'harvest-field,' and when a suitable place\r\nwas discovered the ship was brought up into the wind, that is, the helm\r\nwas so turned as to bring the ship's head towards the wind, when of\r\ncourse the sails got 'aback,' and the ship stopped. Then a boat was\r\nlowered, and a crew, of which I was one, got into it, with the end of a\r\nvery long rope, and we pulled away towards the edge of a large\r\nice-field, hauling out the rope after us, of course, from the coil on\r\nshipboard. As we approached the ice, the seals near by all became\r\nfrightened, and floundered into the sea as quickly as they could, with a\r\ntremendous splash. In a few minutes they all came up again, putting\r\ntheir cunning-looking heads out of the water, all around the boat, no\r\ndoubt as curious to see what these singular-looking beings were that had\r\ncome amongst them, as the Indians were about Columbus and his Spaniards,\r\nwhen they first came to America.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we had reached the ice, we sprang out of the boat on to it,\r\nand, after digging a hole into it with a long, sharp bar of iron, called\r\nan ice-chisel, we put therein one end of a large, heavy, crooked hook,\r\ncalled an ice-anchor, and then to a ring in the other end of this\r\nice-anchor we made fast the end of the rope that we had brought with us.\r\nThis done, we signalled to the people on board to 'haul in,' which they\r\ndid on their end of the rope, and in a little while the ship was drawn\r\nclose up to the ice. Then another rope was run out over the stern of the\r\nship, and, this being made fast to an ice-anchor in the same way as the\r\nother, the ship was soon drawn up with her whole broadside close to the\r\nice, as snug as if she were lying alongside of a dock in New Bedford.\r\n\r\n\"And now began the seal-hunt. It would not interest you to hear all\r\nabout the preparations we made, first to catch the seals, and then to\r\npreserve the skins and try out the oil from the blubber, and put it away\r\nin barrels. For this latter duty some of the crew were selected, while\r\nothers were sent off to kill and bring in the seals. These latter were\r\nchosen with a view to their activity, and I, being supposed to be of\r\nthat sort, was one of the party. I was glad enough, I can assure you, to\r\nget off the vessel for once on to something firm and solid, even if it\r\nwas only ice, and at least for a little while to have done with rocking\r\nand rolling about over the waves.\r\n\r\n\"Each one of the seal-catchers was armed with a short club for killing\r\nthe seals, and a rope to drag them over the ice to the ship. We\r\nscattered in every direction, our object being each by himself to\r\napproach a group of seals, and, coming upon them as noiselessly as\r\npossible, to kill as many of them as we could before they should all\r\ntake fright and rush into the sea. In order to do this, we were obliged\r\nto steal up between the seals and the water as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\"My first essay at this novel business was ridiculous enough, and,\r\nbesides nearly causing my death, overwhelmed me with mortification. It\r\nhappened thus. I made at a large herd of seals, nearly all of which\r\nwere lying some distance from the edge of the ice, and before they could\r\nget into the water I had managed to intercept about a dozen of them.\r\nThus far I thought myself very lucky; but, as the poet Burns says,\r\n\r\n    'The best laid schemes o' mice and men\r\n      Gang aft a-gley,\r\n    And leave us naught but grief and pain\r\n      For promised joy,'--\r\n\r\nso it fell out with me. The seals, of course, all rushed towards the\r\nwater as fast as they could go, the moment they saw me coming. But I got\r\nup with them in time, and struck one on the nose, killing it, and was in\r\nthe act of striking another, when a huge fellow that was big enough to\r\nhave been the father of the whole flock, too badly frightened to mind\r\nwhere he was going, ran his head between my legs, and, whipping up my\r\nheels in an instant, landed me on his back, in which absurd position I\r\nwas carried into the sea before I could recover myself. Of course I sunk\r\nimmediately, and dreadfully cold was the water; but, rising to the\r\nsurface in a moment, I was preparing to make a vigorous effort to swim\r\nback to the ice, when another badly frightened and ill-mannered seal, as\r\nI am sure you will all think, plunged into the sea without once looking\r\nto see what he was doing, and hit me with the point of his nose fairly\r\nin the stomach.\r\n\r\n\"I thought now for certain that my misfortunes were all over, and that\r\nmy end was surely come. However, I got my head above the surface once\r\nmore, and did my best to keep it there; but my hopes vanished when I\r\nperceived that I was at least twenty feet from the edge of the ice. It\r\nwas as much as I could do to keep my head above water, without swimming\r\nforward, so much embarrassed was I by my heavy clothing, the great\r\ncold, and the terrible pains (worse than those of colic) caused by the\r\nseal hitting me in the stomach. I am quite certain that this would have\r\nbeen the last of John Hardy's adventures, had not one of my companions,\r\nseeing me going overboard on the back of the seal, rushed to my rescue.\r\nHe threw me his line for dragging seals (the end of which I had barely\r\nstrength to catch and hold on to), and then he drew me out as one would\r\nhaul up a large fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Hardy takes a Ride without meaning it.]\r\n\r\n\"I came from the sea in a most sorry condition, as you can well imagine.\r\nMy mouth was full of salt water. I was so prostrated with the cold that\r\nI could scarcely stand, and my pains were so great that I should\r\ncertainly have screamed had I not been so full of water that I could\r\nnot utter a single word. But I managed, after a while, to get all the\r\nwater spit out, and then, after drawing into my lungs a few good long\r\nbreaths of air, I felt greatly refreshed. I could still, however, hardly\r\nstand, and was shivering with the cold. But I found that I had strength\r\nenough to stagger back to the ship, where I was greeted in a manner far\r\nfrom pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"The sailors looked upon my adventure as a great joke, never once\r\nseeming to think how near I was to death's door, and the mate simply\r\ncried out 'Overboard, eh? Pity the sharks didn't catch him!' It was\r\nclear enough that this red-faced tyrant would show me no mercy; and\r\nwhen, pale and cold and panting for breath, I asked him for leave to go\r\nbelow for a while, he cried out, 'Yes, for just five minutes. Be lively,\r\nor I'll warm your back for you with a rope's end.'\r\n\r\n\"The prospect of a 'back warming' of this description had the effect to\r\nmake me lively, sure enough, although I was shivering as if I would\r\nshake all my teeth out, and tumble all my bones down into a heap. As\r\nsoon as I reached the deck, the mate cried out again for me to 'be\r\nlively,' and when he set after me with an uplifted rope's end, his face\r\nglaring at me all the while like a red-hot furnace, you may be sure I\r\nwas quite as lively as it was possible for me to be, and was over the\r\nship's side in next to no time at all, and off after seals again. After\r\na while I got warmed up with exercise, and this time, being more\r\ncautious, I met with no similar misadventure, and soon came in dragging\r\nthree seals after me. The mate now complimented me by exclaiming, 'Why,\r\nlook at the lubber!'\r\n\r\n\"We continued at this seal-hunting for a good many days, during which we\r\nshifted our position frequently, and made what the sealers called a good\r\n'catch.' But still the barrels in the hold of the ship were not much\r\nmore than half of them filled with oil, when a great storm set in, and,\r\nthe ice threatening to close in upon us, we were forced to get\r\neverything aboard, to cast loose from the ice-field, and work our way\r\nsouth into clear water again, which we were fortunate enough to do\r\nwithout accident. But some other vessels which had come up while we were\r\nfishing, and were very near to us, were not so lucky. Two of them were\r\ncaught by the moving ice-fields before they could make their escape, and\r\nwere crushed all to pieces. The crews, however, saved themselves by\r\njumping out on the ice, and were all successful in reaching other\r\nvessels, having managed to save their boats before their ships actually\r\nwent down. It was a very fearful sight, the crushing up of these\r\nvessels,--as if they were nothing more than eggshells in the hand.\r\n\r\n\"This storm lasted, with occasional interruptions, thirteen days, but\r\nthe breaks in it were of such short duration that we had little\r\nopportunity to 'fish' (as seal-catching is called) any more. We\r\napproached the ice several times, only to be driven off again before we\r\nhad fairly succeeded in getting to work, and hence we caught very few\r\nseals.\r\n\r\n\"By the time the storm was over the season for seal-fishing was nearly\r\nover too; so we had no alternative, if we would get a good cargo of oil,\r\nbut to go in search of whales, which would take us still farther north,\r\nand into much heavier ice, and therefore, necessarily, into even greater\r\ndanger than we had hitherto encountered. Accordingly, the course of the\r\nvessel was changed, and I found that we were steering almost due north,\r\navoiding the ice as much as possible, but passing a great deal of it\r\nevery day. The wind being mostly fair, and the ice not thick enough at\r\nany time to obstruct our passage, we hauled in our latitude very fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Captain Hardy,\" here interrupted William, \"what is hauling\r\nin latitude?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's for going farther north,\" answered the Captain. \"Latitude is\r\ndistance from the equator, either north or south, and what a sailor\r\nmakes in northing or southing he calls 'hauling in his latitude,' just\r\nas making easting or westing is 'hauling in his longitude.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Captain,\" said William, politely, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Is it all clear now?\" inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said William, \"clear as mud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear as mud, eh! Well, that isn't as clear as the pea-soup was they\r\nused to give us on board the _Blackbird_, for that was so clear that, if\r\nthe ocean had been made of it, you might have seen through it all the\r\nway down to the bottom; indeed, one of the old sailors said that it\r\nwasn't soup at all. 'If dat is soup,' growled he, 'den I's sailed forty\r\ntousand mile trough soup,'--which is the number of miles he was supposed\r\nto have sailed in his various voyages.\r\n\r\n\"But no matter for the soup. The days wore on none the less that the\r\nsoup was thin, and still we kept going on and on,--getting farther and\r\nfarther north, and into more and more ice. Sometimes our course was much\r\ninterrupted, and we had to wait several days for the ice to open; then\r\nwe would get under way again, and push on. At length it seemed to me\r\nthat we must be very near the North Pole. It was a strange world we had\r\ncome into. The sun was shining all the time. There was no night at\r\nall,--broad daylight constantly. This, of course, favored us; indeed,\r\nhad there been any darkness, we could not have sailed among the ice at\r\nall. As it was, we were obliged to be very cautious, for the ice often\r\nclosed upon us without giving us a chance to escape, obliging us to get\r\nout great long saws, and cut out and float away great blocks of the ice,\r\nuntil we had made a dock for the ship, where she could ride with safety.\r\nWe had many narrow escapes from being crushed.\r\n\r\n\"At first, when we concluded to go after whales, there were several\r\nvessels in company with us. At one time I counted nine, all in sight at\r\none time; but we had become separated in thick weather; and whether they\r\nhad gone ahead of us, or had fallen behind, we could not tell. However,\r\nwe kept on and on and on; where we were, or where we were going, I, of\r\ncourse, had not the least idea; but I became aware, from day to day,\r\nthat greater dangers were threatening us, for _icebergs_ came in great\r\nnumbers to add their terrors to those which we had already in the\r\nice-fields. They became at length (and suddenly too) very numerous, and\r\nnot being able to go around them on account of the field-ice, which was\r\non either side, we entered right amongst them. The atmosphere was\r\nsomewhat foggy at the time, and it seemed as if the icebergs chilled the\r\nvery air we breathed. I fairly shuddered as we passed the first opening.\r\nThe ice was now at least three times as high as our masts, and very\r\nlikely more than that, and it appeared to cover the sea in every\r\ndirection. It seemed to me that we were going to certain destruction,\r\nand indeed I thought I read a warning written as it were on the bergs\r\nthemselves. Upon the corner of an iceberg to the left of us there stood\r\na white figure, as plain as anything could possibly be. One hand of this\r\nstrange, weird-looking figure was resting on the ice beside it, while\r\nthe other was pointing partly upwards toward heaven, and backwards\r\ntoward the south whence we had come. I thought I saw the figure move,\r\nand, much excited, I called the attention of one of the sailors to it.\r\n'Why, you lubber,' said he, 'don't you know that the sun melts the ice\r\ninto all sorts of shapes. Look overhead, if there isn't a man's face!' I\r\nlooked up as the sailor had directed me, and, sure enough, there was a\r\nman's face plainly to be seen in the lines of an immense tongue of ice\r\nwhich was projecting from the side of a berg on the right, and under\r\nwhich we were about to pass.\r\n\r\n\"I became now really terrified. In addition to these strange spectral\r\nobjects, the air was filled with loud reports, and deep, rumbling\r\nnoises, caused by the icebergs breaking to pieces, or masses splitting\r\noff from their sides and falling into the sea. These noises came at\r\nfirst from the icebergs in front of us; but when we had got fairly into\r\nthe wilderness of ice which covered the sea, they came from every side.\r\nIt struck me that we had passed deliberately into the very jaws of\r\ndeath, and that from the frightful situation there was no escape.\r\n\r\n\"I merely mention this as the feeling which oppressed me, and which I\r\ncould not shake off. Indeed, the feeling grew upon me rather than\r\ndecreased. The fog came on very thick, settling over us as if it were\r\nour funeral shroud. Some snow also fell, which made the air still more\r\ngloomy. The noises were multiplying, and we could no longer tell whence\r\nthey came, so thick was the air. We were groping about like a traveller\r\nwho has lost his way in a vast forest, and has been overtaken by the\r\ndark night.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me now that our doom was sealed,--that all our hope was\r\nleft behind us when we passed the opening to this vast wilderness of\r\nicebergs; and the more I thought of it, the more it seemed to me that\r\nthe figure standing on the corner of the iceberg where we entered,\r\nwhether it was ice or whatever it was, had been put there as a warning.\r\nHow far my fears were right you shall see presently.\r\n\r\n\"The fog, as I have said, kept on thickening more and more, until we\r\ncould scarcely see anything at all. I have never, I think, seen so thick\r\na fog, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the ship was kept\r\nfrom striking the icebergs. Then, after a while, the wind fell away\r\nsteadily, and finally grew entirely calm. The current was moving us\r\nabout upon the dead waters; and in order to prevent this current from\r\nsetting us against the ice, we had to lower the boats, and, making lines\r\nfast to the ship and to the boats, pull away with our oars to keep\r\nheadway on the ship, that she might be steered clear of the dangerous\r\nplaces. Thus was made a slow progress, but it was very hard work. At\r\nlength the second mate, who was steering the foremost boat, which I was\r\nin, cried out, 'Fast ice ahead.' Now 'fast ice' is a belt of ice which\r\nis attached firmly to the land, not yet having been broken up or\r\ndissolved by the warmth of the summer. This announcement created great\r\njoy to everybody in the boats, as we knew that land must be near, and we\r\nall supposed that we would be ordered to make a line fast to the ice,\r\nthat we might hold on there until the fog cleared up and the wind came\r\nagain. But instead of this we were ordered by the mate to pull away from\r\nit. And then, after having got the vessel, as was supposed, into a good,\r\nclear, open space of water,--at least, there was not a particle of ice\r\nin sight,--we were all ordered, very imprudently, as it appeared to\r\nevery one of us, to come on board to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"We had just finished our breakfast, and were preparing to go on deck,\r\nand then into the boats again, when there was a loud cry raised. 'Ice\r\nclose aboard! Hurry up! Man the boats!' were the orders which I heard\r\namong a great many other confusing sounds; and when I got on deck, I\r\nsaw, standing away up in the fog, its top completely obscured in the\r\nthick cloud, an enormous iceberg. The side nearest to us hung over from\r\na perpendicular, as the projecting tongue on which I had before seen the\r\nman's face. It was very evident that we were slowly drifting upon this\r\nfrightful object,--directly under this overhanging tongue. It was a\r\nfearful sight to behold, for it looked as if it was just ready to\r\ncrumble to pieces; and indeed, at every instant, small fragments were\r\nbreaking off from it, with loud reports, and falling into the sea.\r\n\r\n\"We were but a moment getting into the boats. The boat which I was in\r\nhad something the start of the other two. Just as we were pulling away,\r\nthe master of the ship came on deck, and ordered us to do what, had the\r\nred-faced mate done an hour before, would have made it impossible that\r\nthis danger should have come upon us. 'Carry your line out to the fast\r\nice,' was the order we received from the master; and every one of us,\r\nrealizing the great danger, pulled as hard as he could. The 'fast ice'\r\nwas dimly in sight when we started, for we had drifted while at\r\nbreakfast towards it, as well as towards the berg. Only a few minutes\r\nwere needed to reach it. We jumped out and dug a hole, and planted the\r\nice-anchor. The ship was out of sight, buried in the fog. A faint voice\r\ncame from the ship. It was, 'Hurry up! we have struck.' They evidently\r\ncould not see us. The line was fastened to the anchor in an instant, and\r\nthe second mate shouted, 'Haul in! haul in!' There was no answer but\r\n'Hurry up! we have struck.' 'Haul in! haul in!' shouted the second mate,\r\nbut still there was no answer. 'They can't hear nor see,' said he,\r\nhurriedly; and then, turning to me, said, 'Hardy, you watch the anchor\r\nthat it don't give way. Boys, jump in the boat, and we'll go nearer the\r\nship so they can hear.' The boat was gone quickly into the fog, and I\r\nwas then alone on the ice by the anchor,--how much and truly alone you\r\nshall hear.\r\n\r\n\"Quick as the lightning flash, sudden as the change of one second to\r\nanother, there broke upon me a sound that will never leave my ears. It\r\nwas as if a volcano had burst forth, or an earthquake had instantly\r\ntumbled a whole city into ruins. A fearful shock, like a sudden\r\nexplosion, filled the air. I saw faintly through the thick mists the\r\nmasts of the ship reeling over, and I saw no more;--vessel and iceberg\r\nand the disappearing boat were buried in chaos. The whole side of the\r\nberg nearest the vessel had split off, hurling thousands and hundreds of\r\nthousands of tons of ice, and thousands of fragments, crashing down upon\r\nthe doomed ship. Escape the vessel could not, nor her crew, the shock\r\ncame so suddenly. The spray thrown up into the air completely hid\r\neverything from view; but the noise which came from out the gloom told\r\nthe tale.\r\n\r\n\"Presently there was a loud rush. Great waves, set in motion by the\r\ncrumbling iceberg, with white crests that were frightful to look upon,\r\ncame tearing out of the obscurity, and, perceiving the danger of my\r\nsituation, I ran from it as fast as I could run. And I was just in time;\r\nfor the waves broke up the ice where I had been standing into a hundred\r\nfragments, and crack after crack opened close behind me.\r\n\r\n\"I had not, however, far to run before I had reached a place of safety,\r\nfor the force of the waves was soon spent. And when I saw what had\r\nhappened, I fell down flat upon the ice, crying, 'Saved, but for what?\r\nto freeze or starve! O that I had perished with the rest of them!'\r\n\r\n\"So now you see that I was really and truly _cast away in the cold_. In\r\nalmost a single instant the ship which had borne me through what had\r\nseemed great perils was, so far as appeared to me, swallowed up in the\r\nsea,--crushed and broken into fragments by the falling ice, and every\r\none of my companions was swallowed up with it. And there I was on an\r\nice-raft, in the middle of the Arctic Sea, without food or shelter,\r\nwrapped in a great black, impenetrable fog, with the prospect of a\r\nlingering death staring me in the face.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Captain here paused as if to take breath, for he had been talking\r\nvery fast, and had grown somewhat excited as he recalled this terrible\r\nscene. The eyes of the children were riveted upon him, so deeply were\r\nthey interested in the tale of the shipwreck; and it was some time\r\nbefore any one spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" exclaimed William at last, \"that was being cast away in the cold\r\nfor certain, Captain Hardy. I had no idea it was so frightful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Fred, evidently doubting if Captain Hardy was really the\r\nshipwrecked boy; but Alice said not a word, for she was lost in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"I should not have believed it was you, Captain Hardy,\" continued\r\nWilliam, \"if you had not been telling the story yourself, this very\r\nminute; for I cannot see how you should ever have got out of that\r\nscrape. It's ever so much worse than going into the sea on the seal's\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain smiled at these observations of the boys, and said: \"It was\r\na pretty bad scrape to get into, and no mistake; but through the mercy\r\nof Providence I got out of it in the end, as you see; otherwise I\r\nshouldn't have been here to tell the tale; but how I saved myself, and\r\nwhat became of the rest of the crew, you shall hear to-morrow, for it is\r\nnow too late to begin the story. The evening is coming on, and your\r\nparents will be looking for you home; so good by, my dears. To-morrow\r\nyou must come down earlier,--the earlier the better, and if there's any\r\nwind we'll have a sail.\" And now the children once more took leave of\r\nthe ancient mariner, with hearts filled with thanks, which they could\r\nnever get done speaking, and with heads filled with astonishment that\r\nthe Captain should be alive to tell the tale which they had heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Old Man meets the Little People under Peculiar\r\nCircumstances, and relates to them how the Young Man,\r\nbeing cast away in the Cold, rescued a Shipmate, and\r\nalso other Matters, which, if put into this Title, would\r\nspoil the Story altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis time Captain Hardy was not to be caught napping, as on the previous\r\nday. Indeed, he was out looking for his young friends even before the\r\ntime. \"If they don't come soon,\" said he to himself, \"I'll go after\r\nthem\";--and they did not come soon, at least the Captain thought they\r\nwere a long time in coming, and he started off, if not after them, at\r\nleast to look after them. When he had reached the brow of the hill from\r\nwhich both the Captain's and Mr. Earnest's houses could be seen, the old\r\nman discovered the children coming down one of the winding paths which\r\nled through Mr. Earnest's grounds. It was some moments before they saw\r\nthe Captain, and when they did see him there was much wondering what had\r\nhappened to bring him up so far on the hill.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter with him?\" exclaimed William. \"Look, he's\r\nflinging up his hat!\"--and the little people set off upon a rapid run.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Captain stood on the brow of the hill, whirling round his\r\ntarpaulin hat with the long blue ribbons flying wildly in the wind. When\r\nthe children came nearer, they heard the old man calling loudly to them,\r\n\"Come, my hearties, you are slow to-day. Be lively, or we'll lose the\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What chance?\" asked William, when they had come up with him.\r\n\r\n\"The wind, the wind,--why, don't you see there's a spankin' breeze? I\r\nwas afraid we'd lose our sail, so I came to hurry you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted both the boys together; and without further\r\nado the Captain hurried the little people along with him down through\r\nthe woods to the water.\r\n\r\nThe old man had been down there before, and had everything in readiness.\r\nThe little yacht was lying close beside the little wharf. \"Look sharp\r\nnow, and be lively,\" exclaimed the Captain as he helped them one by one\r\naboard; and then he got in himself, and shoved the yacht off from the\r\nlanding, and with the assistance of a singular-looking boy, whom the\r\nCaptain called \"Main Brace,\" he spread the sails, and the lively craft\r\nwas soon skimming over the waters, carrying as lively a party as ever\r\nset out on an afternoon frolic. \"Jolly\" was the only word which seemed\r\nat all to express the children's pleasure, and if the boys said \"it's\r\njolly\" once, they must have said it fifty times at least; while little\r\nAlice exhibited her excitement by jumping from one side of the boat to\r\nthe other, stopping now and then to lean over the side and watch the\r\nlittle waves gurgling past them, sometimes dipping her delicate hands\r\ninto the water, and screaming with delight when the spray flew over her.\r\n\r\nThe party were seated (when seated at all) in what is called the \"stern\r\nsheets,\" that is, on the seat in the open space behind the cabin\r\nheretofore described,--the good-natured and kindly Captain in the midst\r\nof them, firmly holding the helm or tiller of his boat, and guiding it\r\nwith steady hand wherever he wished it to go, cracking a pleasant joke\r\nnow and then, and enjoying in all the fulness of his big, warm heart the\r\njoyous delight of his young guests. And he was in no hurry to stop the\r\nsport, for he ran on clear across the harbor, and then said he would\r\n\"'bout ship,\" and put back again.\r\n\r\n\"What's 'bout ship?\" inquired William.\r\n\r\n\"That's going about on the other tack,\" replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"What's going about on the other tack?\" asked William, as wise as he was\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you,\" said the Captain. \"Now see here: first I give the\r\nproper order, as if somebody else was giving it to me, and I was the man\r\nat the wheel: 'Hard-a-lee,' do you observe;--now look, I put the helm\r\ndown as far as I can jam it,--there;--look now, how that turns the boat\r\nand brings her up into the wind,--you see the sails begin to\r\nshiver,--the wind is blowing right in your faces now;--now we have\r\nturned nearly round; the boat, you see, has come up on an even\r\nkeel,--level, you know;--now look out sharp for your heads there,--the\r\nboom is going to jibe over to the other side;--there, don't you see\r\nwe've turned round,--that house over there near the beach that was\r\nalmost ahead of us is now behind us. There goes the boom,--bang! There\r\nfills the sail, see it bulging out,--the jib, you see, shakes a little\r\nyet,--but there she goes now filled out like the other; and now you see\r\nI've got the helm back where I had it before, in the middle, 'steady,'\r\nyou know, and there goes the _Alice_ off on the starboard tack, and an\r\neasy bowline back towards the Mariner's Rest again. Wasn't that nicely\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid! splendid!\" cried William; \"I wish I could do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll teach you,--it's easy learned,\" answered the Captain; \"but look\r\nout there, or you'll go overboard; get up to windward, and trim the\r\nboat; you see we are leaning over to the other side now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Captain kept on \"tacking\" across the harbor, going to and\r\nfro, for more than an hour, enjoying every minute of it just as much as\r\nthe children did. When at length, however, the children began to quiet\r\ndown a little (the sharp edge of novelty being worn off), the Captain\r\nran into shoal water, and brought his boat's head once more up into the\r\nwind; but this time, instead of letting her head \"pay\" off to starboard,\r\nhe steered her right into the wind's eye, with the sails shivering all\r\nthe time, until the boat stopped, when he cried out to Main Brace to\r\n\"let go the anchor,\" which Main Brace did promptly, with an \"Ay, ay,\r\nsir!\" and then he \"clewed\" up the sails, and spread a white and red\r\nstriped and red-fringed awning over the place where they were seated,\r\nand said he was now going on with the story. \"Isn't this a tip-top\r\nplace,\" said he, \"for story-telling?\" And the children all said it was\r\n\"tip-top,\" and \"jolly,\" and \"grand,\" and made many little speeches about\r\nit, which to put down here would make this account so long that\r\neverybody would get tired before getting to the end of it.\r\n\r\n\"Now I call this a much better place than the 'Crow's Nest,'\" went on\r\nthe Captain; \"for, don't you see, when we knocked off yesterday I was\r\nstanding in the middle of the sea, on a great ice-raft. To be sure we\r\nare not exactly in the middle of the sea here, nor on an ice-raft\r\neither, but we are on salt water, and that's where I like to be. The air\r\nis better for the wits, and the tongue too, for that matter, than on the\r\nland there, which is a good enough place to be when there is no wind;\r\nbut I like to be on the water, and have plenty of sea-room, when the\r\nwind blows, especially when it blows a gale,--for on land, at such\r\ntimes, I'm always afraid that the trees will blow over on me, or the\r\nhouse will blow down on my head, or some dreadful accident will happen,\r\nwhereas on the sea one has no fears at all; and besides, at sea one is\r\nalways at home,--come rain or shine, he's always his house with him, and\r\nnever has to go groping about for shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only you mustn't be in the forecastle,\" put in cunning William, who\r\nremembered the Captain's fright when he first found himself at sea in\r\nthe _Blackbird_.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that, lad,\" replied the Captain, \"I was only a boy then, and\r\nhadn't come to years of discretion. I've made better friends with the\r\nsea since that day. But let us go on, or we'll never get through with\r\nthis story, any more than the Flying Dutchman will get into port, though\r\nhe keeps on beating up and down forever; and as for to-day, why, we'll\r\nleave off just where we began, like thieves in a treadmill, if we don't\r\nget started pretty soon.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, as I was saying, you left me standing on an ice-raft in\r\nthe middle of the Arctic Sea, cast away in a cold and forbidding place,\r\nand all alone. My shipmates were all either drowned or killed outright\r\nby the falling ice, so far at least as I knew. The prospect ahead was\r\nnot a pleasing one, for of course, as I think I have said before, the\r\nfirst thought which crossed my mind was, that I should starve or freeze\r\nto death very soon. I was greatly astonished by what had happened, and\r\nindeed it was hard for me to believe my senses, so suddenly had this\r\ngreat disaster come upon me. I stood staring into the mist, and\r\nlistening to the terrible sounds which came out of it, as one petrified;\r\nyet after a little time I recovered myself sufficiently to realize my\r\nsituation. The instinct of life is strong in every living thing, and\r\nyoung sailor-boys are no exception to the rule; so, after I had stood in\r\nthe presence of this frightful chaos for I have not the least idea how\r\nlong, I began to think what I should do to save myself.\r\n\r\n\"The waves which had been raised after a while began steadily to\r\nsubside, and, as the sea became more calm, I found that I could approach\r\nnearer to where the wreck had happened by jumping over some of the\r\ncracks which had been made in the ice, and walking across piece after\r\npiece of it. These pieces were all in motion, rolling on the swell of\r\nthe sea, and, the farther I went, of course the greater the motion\r\nbecame. I had to proceed cautiously, and when I jumped from one fragment\r\nof ice to another, I was obliged to look carefully what I was about, for\r\nif I missed my footing I should fall into the sea, and be either drowned\r\nor ground up by the moving ice.\r\n\r\n\"Had the iceberg all gone to pieces at once, the sea would soon have\r\nbecome quiet; but it was evident from the noises which reached me that a\r\nconsiderable part of the berg was still holding together, and was\r\nwallowing in the sea in consequence of its equilibrium being disturbed\r\nby the first crash, and was still keeping the waters moving. I could\r\nindeed vaguely see this remaining fragment, swaying to right and left,\r\nand I could also perceive that, with every roll, fresh masses were\r\nbreaking off, with loud reports, like the crash of artillery. I could,\r\nhowever, discover nothing of the ship nor either of the boats. I was\r\nable to detect, even at a considerable distance, some fragments of ice\r\nfloating and rolling about, when the fog would clear up a little; and,\r\nas I peered into the gloom, I thought at one time that I saw a man\r\nstanding upon one of them. It was but a moment, for the fog closed upon\r\nthe object, whatever it may have been, and it vanished as a spectral\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\"My eyes were strained to catch a further glimpse of this object, but\r\nnothing more was to be seen of it. From this my attention was soon\r\nattracted by a dark mass which had drifted upon the edge of the broken\r\nice, not far to the right of the place where I had been standing when\r\nthe boat left me. I soon made this out to be some part of the wreck of\r\nthe ship. In a few moments I could clearly see that it was a piece of a\r\nmast; then I could plainly distinguish the 'foretop.' Each succeeding\r\nwave was forcing it higher and higher out of the water, and I\r\ndiscovered, after a few moments, that other timbers were attached to it,\r\nand that beside these were sails and ropes, making of the whole a\r\nconsiderable mass.\r\n\r\n\"After observing this fragment of the wreck attentively for some time, I\r\nthought I perceived a man moving among the tangled collection of timbers\r\nand ropes and sails, endeavoring to extricate himself. Whatever it might\r\nbe, it was some distance above the sea,--so high, indeed, that the waves\r\nno longer washed it fairly,--only the spray.\r\n\r\n\"It soon became clear to me that my suspicions that this was a man were\r\ncorrect; and being more convinced that one of my shipmates at least was\r\nyet alive, I rushed forward to rescue him if possible, without once\r\nstopping to give a thought to the risks I would encounter. It was clear\r\nthat he could not liberate himself.\r\n\r\n\"You will remember that I was now standing on a fragment of ice which\r\nhad been broken off from the solid ice-field by the waves. It was one of\r\na number of similar fragments, all lying more or less close together,\r\nand between me and the place where I had been standing when the waves\r\nbegan to subside, and the ice ceased to break up. Before me the ice was\r\nin the same broken condition as behind me, only, being nearer the open\r\nwater, the pieces were rolling more, so that there was much greater\r\ndanger in springing from piece to piece. Without, however, pausing to\r\nreflect upon this circumstance, I rushed forward as fast as I could go,\r\njumping with ease over every obstacle in my way, until I was on the\r\npiece of ice that held up the end of the tangled wreck. I had evidently\r\narrived in the very nick of time, for the wreck was, instead of coming\r\nfarther up, now beginning to sink back into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rescued from the Wreck.]\r\n\r\n\"What I had taken for a man proved to be one, or, as I soon found out, a\r\nboy,--the cabin-boy of the ship, a light, pale-faced lad, and only\r\nfourteen years old. The boy was evidently fast in some way among the\r\nrigging, and had been trying to free himself. As I came closer, I\r\nobserved that he was entirely quiet, and had sunk out of view. Quick as\r\nthought I mounted up into the wreck, and then I saw the boy with a rope\r\ntangled round his leg, and lying quite insensible. Underneath him\r\nanother man was lying, much mutilated, and evidently quite dead. As I\r\nwas mounting up, a wave washed in under the wreck, but I escaped with\r\nonly a little spray flying over me, which, however, did not wet me\r\nmuch. It was but the work of a moment to whip out my knife, which I\r\ncarried in a belt, like every other sailor, and cut the rope which bound\r\nthe boy down, and which he had tried in vain to loosen. After this I had\r\nno further difficulty, and, seizing the boy around the waist with one\r\narm (he was very light even for his years), I clambered out of the wreck\r\nto the ice without getting much more water upon me, and, hurrying off,\r\ndid not stop until I had jumped with my burden across several cracks,\r\nand ran across several pieces of ice, reaching a place of present safety\r\non the unbroken or fast ice. Here I laid down my insensible burden, all\r\ndripping with the cold water, and in a state of great anxiety I bent\r\nover the boy. At first I thought that he was dead, but it was soon clear\r\nthat this was not the case, for he was breathing, although slowly, yet\r\nfreely. Out from his wet hair a little blood was oozing, and upon\r\nexamining the spot I found that there was a bad bruise there, and that\r\nthe skin was broken, though there was not a serious cut. This was\r\nclearly the cause of his present unconsciousness, as his breathing\r\nseemed conclusively to show that he had managed to keep his head above\r\nwater, and had not been brought to his present state by drowning. It\r\noccurred to me that the blow had simply stunned him, and that it had\r\ncome almost at the moment I arrived to rescue him. I could not perceive\r\nthat the skull was fractured, and I felt convinced that, if the boy\r\ncould be warmed and allowed to lie at rest, he would after a while come\r\nto his senses. To this conclusion I arrived while leaning over the poor\r\nfellow, examining his hurt, while he lay on the chilly ice, never once\r\nthinking where I was, and all the while calling frantically to him; but\r\nI might as well have called to a stone. When I rose up, fully impressed\r\nwith the necessity of securing for the lad rest and warmth, and fully\r\nrealized, for the first time, my powerless situation (that I was even\r\napparently unable to save myself, still less the boy), my heart seemed\r\nto give way entirely, and I sank down once more beside him. A prayer to\r\nHeaven for succor, which I had no thought could ever come to me, rose to\r\nmy lips, and at that very moment a ray of hope dawned upon me. The great\r\nfog was breaking away, the bright sun was scattering the mists, and land\r\nwas bursting through it near at hand. Light, fleecy clouds were rolling\r\nup above the sea, and, as they floated off before a gentle wind, a blaze\r\nof sunshine burst through an opening in them and fell upon myself and\r\nthe boy whose life I had, at least for the present, saved.\r\n\r\n\"I could now look out over the sea for a considerable distance. Although\r\nthere was still much confusion, yet the ice was steadily quieting down,\r\nand the waves caused by it were subsiding rapidly. But a change not less\r\nmarked had taken place in the space between where I stood and the open\r\nwater. The wreck from which I had rescued the boy had settled back into\r\nthe sea, and the fragments of ice were separating and floating off. Had\r\nI delayed a few minutes longer, I should never have reached the fast\r\nice, but should have drifted off upon the dark waters, as the man had\r\ndone whom I saw standing in the fog that I have told you of before.\r\n\r\n\"As the fog cleared up more and more, the land which first appeared\r\nstood out boldly, and the sea was visible over a range of many miles. It\r\nwas dotted all over with fragments of ice and numerous icebergs, many of\r\nwhich reached up into the disappearing mists, looking like white\r\nmountains in miniature, with clouds drifting across their summits. The\r\nland did not appear to be more than a mile distant from me, and it was\r\nevident that I stood upon ice which was fast to it. Indeed, when I was\r\nfirst cast upon this ice, I might have known, had I paused to reflect,\r\nthat land must be very near, as the name 'fast ice' indicates clearly of\r\nitself that simple fact.\r\n\r\n\"With this lighting up of the air, various thoughts came into my mind.\r\nFirst, could I get to the land and save the boy as well as myself;\r\nsecondly, could I aid anybody else; and thirdly, could I save anything\r\nof the wreck out of the sea. These last two reflections were quickly\r\ndisposed of, for although I could see many fragments of the wreck, none\r\nwere within reach, and no other person was in sight,--ship and boats and\r\nmen were all gone down before the crushing avalanche, and nothing was\r\nleft but myself and a senseless boy.\r\n\r\n\"I must here pause to tell you that, although we were in the Arctic\r\nregions, and on the ice, the weather was not cold, the time being the\r\nmiddle of the summer. Of course the dense fog made the air damp and\r\nchilly, but, as I have said, not exactly cold. My shipmates, before the\r\nwreck happened, never dressed in anything warmer than the usual woollen\r\nclothing, and seldom wore coats. For some reason, I do not exactly\r\nremember why, I had, upon going on deck from breakfast that fatal\r\nmorning, in addition to my ordinary coat, put on a heavy pilot-cloth\r\novercoat, which had been furnished me by the master of the ship,--the\r\nprice of it to be deducted from my wages. And it was most fortunate that\r\nI had put this coat on, for it now served a good purpose in wrapping up\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that there was now nothing to be gained by longer delay on the\r\nice, I picked up the boy in my arms and started for the land. It may\r\nstrike you as somewhat strange that I should have gone about it so\r\ncalmly, or indeed that I did not fall down in despair, and at once give\r\nup the hope of saving myself when there was so little, or rather no,\r\napparent prospect of it before me. But for this there were some very\r\nnatural reasons. In the first place, the thought of saving the boy's\r\nlife kept my mind from dwelling too much upon my own misfortunes; and\r\nthen, the hope of finding the land which had come in sight out of the\r\nfog inhabited, stimulated my courage, and inspired exertion.\r\n\r\n\"Although the boy was not heavy, yet I found that in the distance I had\r\nto carry him I grew much fatigued; but the necessity for haste made me\r\nstrong, and to save the boy's life seemed now much more desirable than\r\nto save my own, inasmuch as if the boy died, and I survived him, and\r\ncould in any way manage to live on, I should be in a worse condition\r\nthan if dead, as it appeared to me,--being all alone.\r\n\r\n\"As I approached very near the land, I became much alarmed by\r\ndiscovering that a considerable space of water, partly filled with\r\nfragments of ice, intervened between me and the shore; but, after\r\nholding to the right for a little distance, I came at length to a spot\r\nwhere the ice was firmly in contact with the land, and, after climbing\r\nover some very rough masses which had been squeezed up along the shore,\r\nI got at last upon the rocks, and then on a patch of green grass, where\r\nI laid down the insensible boy in the blazing sun.\r\n\r\n\"What was I now to do? The boy was yet in very much the same condition\r\nthat he was when I set out with him for the shore. Meanwhile more than\r\nhalf an hour must have elapsed, during which time the boy was wrapped in\r\nhis wet clothes, which, to a man in the full possession of his senses,\r\nwould have been prostrating enough. It seemed to me that he was sinking\r\nunder the effects of the blow which he had received, and the wet clothes\r\nwhich were on his body. I had, however, the gratification of knowing\r\nthat I was on firm land, and away from the cold ice. The grass was warm,\r\nand the air, as I have said, was scarcely chilly. Under these improved\r\nconditions it was clearly better to expose the boy's body wholly to the\r\nair than to allow him to remain in his wet clothes. The first thing,\r\ntherefore, which I did was to divest myself of my own clothing, in order\r\nthat I might give my warm underclothing to the boy. This left for\r\nmyself only my pantaloons and my coat. After buttoning the coat tightly\r\nround me, I undressed the boy, and rubbed his body with such parts of\r\nthe tail of my overcoat as his clothes had not wetted while carrying\r\nhim, and, this done, I drew on to him my shirt and drawers, and then,\r\npulling up the grass, I heaped that about him, and over this threw my\r\ndamp overcoat,--the grass preventing it from touching him. All this\r\noccupied but a few minutes, for I worked with the energy of despair. I\r\nthen set to rubbing and pounding his feet and hands which were very\r\ncold, to get some circulation back into them.\r\n\r\n\"I had now done all that it was possible for me to do for the present\r\ntowards the restoration of my poor companion, who still remained in\r\nprecisely the same insensible state as before, and I now determined to\r\nlook about me and ascertain if there were any evidences of human beings\r\nliving near at hand.\r\n\r\n\"The scene around me was dreary enough to strike terror into a stouter\r\nheart than mine; and, when I had fully viewed it, I had to confess that\r\nit did not seem probable that any living thing, not to mention human\r\nbeings, could possibly be there. The first thought I had was to shout\r\nand halloo again and again at the very top of my voice; but no answer\r\nreached me except the echo of my own words in a deep and dark gorge\r\nclose by. This echo startled me and made me afraid, though I never could\r\ntell why. My loud calling had failed to produce any impression upon the\r\nboy whatever, and I felt sure that he was going to die. Without exactly\r\nknowing what I did, or what I was doing it for, I now ran to the right\r\nover the green grass, and then over rough stones up to a considerable\r\nelevation, and commenced hallooing again, when, much to my astonishment,\r\nI heard a great fluttering and loud sounds right below and within\r\nthirty feet of me. I sprang back as if some terrible enemy had attacked\r\nme; but I recovered myself in an instant, when I observed that the\r\nfluttering came from a number of birds which rose from among the rocks.\r\nThe birds were brown and quite large, and I knew at once that they were\r\neider-ducks, for I had seen them frequently before, while in the ship,\r\nand the sailors had told me their name.\r\n\r\n\"Without having any distinct motive in doing so, I went down to where\r\nthe birds had risen, when still others rose before me in great numbers.\r\nThe rapidity of their flight, and the loud noise which they made,\r\nstartled others still farther away, and thus flock after flock kept on\r\nrising from among the rocks, screaming, and flapping their wings in a\r\nvery loud manner. Several hundreds, perhaps thousands of them, must have\r\nthus got upon their wings and commenced sailing overhead.\r\n\r\n\"You must know that the eider-duck, in order to protect its eggs from\r\nthe air when it goes off to get for food the little fish that it catches\r\nin the sea, plucks from its breast the fine feathers called _down_, in\r\nwhich it buries its eggs very carefully. In each of the nests I found\r\nthere was a good handful of this down, and the thought at once occurred\r\nto me to gather a quantity of it, and cover the boy with it. I went to\r\nwork immediately, and collected a great armful of it, and, hastening to\r\nwhere the boy was, I deposited it, and then hurried back for more. In a\r\nvery short time I had accumulated a great pile, and, spreading a thick\r\nlayer of it out close beside the boy, I drew him over upon it, and then\r\ncovered him completely, and spread my overcoat as I had done before.\r\n\r\n\"The value of putting this discovery to prompt use was soon seen. The\r\nboy, from being cold almost as a corpse, began to show some symptoms of\r\nreturning warmth. His breathing seemed to be more rapid and free, and\r\nhis eyelids began to move a little, though they did not fully open for\r\nsome time; but it was then only for an instant, and I was not certain\r\nwhether he recognized me or not. I called to him loudly by name, I\r\nrubbed his forehead, I pounded his hands, but he gave no further\r\nrecognition; yet he was getting more and more warm, and in this\r\ncircumstance I rested my hope.\r\n\r\n\"Having accomplished this much, and feeling pretty sure that the boy\r\nwould recover in the end, my mind very naturally fell back upon the\r\ncontemplation of my own unhappy condition. I moved a few steps from the\r\nboy, and sat down upon a rock overlooking the sea. There was nothing\r\nthere to inspire me with courage, when this question came uppermost in\r\nmy mind: 'Suppose the boy does recover from his present stupor, how are\r\nwe going to live?' Could anybody indeed be in a more sorry state? Let me\r\nenumerate:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. I had been shipwrecked,--a fortune usually considered bad enough\r\nunder any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"2d. I had lost all of my companions except a feeble boy whom I had\r\nrescued from death, and who was now helpless on my hands.\r\n\r\n\"3d. I was cast away on a desert land, I knew not where, but very far\r\ntowards the North Pole, as was clear enough from the immense quantities\r\nof ice which whitened the sea before me.\r\n\r\n\"4th. I was chilly, and had no fire nor means of making any. Nor had I\r\nsufficient clothing to cover me.\r\n\r\n\"5th. I was hungry, and had no food nor means of obtaining any.\r\n\r\n\"6th. I was thirsty, and had nothing to drink, nor could I discover\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"7th. I was without house or hut to shelter me.\r\n\r\n\"8th. I was without weapons to defend myself against the attacks of wild\r\nbeasts, if any there should be to molest me.\r\n\r\n\"To counteract these evils I had four things, namely:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. Life.\r\n\r\n\"2d. The clothes on my back.\r\n\r\n\"3d. A jack-knife.\r\n\r\n\"4th. The mercy of Providence.\r\n\r\n\"And this was all! What chance was there for me?\r\n\r\n\"Little enough, one would think. And, in truth, there did not seem to be\r\nany at all. When I thought of all this, I buried my face in my hands,\r\nand moaned aloud, and the big tears began to gather in my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"O, wasn't it awful!\" exclaimed William.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what you _could_ do, Captain Hardy,\" exclaimed Fred.\r\n\r\n\"The poor boy,\" exclaimed Alice,--\"I hope he didn't die. Did he, Captain\r\nHardy?\"--and the child began to imitate the example set by John Hardy,\r\nwhen he rested on the rock and looked out upon the icy sea and\r\nspeculated upon the chances of his ever seeing again the home from which\r\nhe had so foolishly run away.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you about that some other time,\" answered the Captain.\r\n\"You may be sure I didn't die, at any rate, whatever may have happened\r\nto the boy; but just now I can tell you no more, for look there at that\r\ncloud coming up out of the sea, appearing, for all the world, as if it\r\nmeant to pipe a squall after us, by and by; and now, with your leave,\r\nwe'll slip home while the play's good. So here goes. Up anchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered William, as he jumped forward very unnecessarily\r\nto help Main Brace, to whom the order to \"up anchor\" was given.\r\n\r\n\"Halloo!\" cried the Captain. \"Turned sailor already, eh?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Main Brace and William were getting in the anchor, the Captain was\r\nstowing away the awning, and then, the yacht being free, he spread the\r\nsails, and with his helm brought her to the wind; and there being now a\r\nlively breeze, the party were not long in crossing over to the Captain's\r\nanchoring-ground, where he turned so as to stop her as he had done\r\nbefore, and then cried out, \"Stand by to let go the anchor,\" to which\r\nWilliam answered, \"Ay, ay, sir!\" and when the boat had stopped, the\r\nCaptain cried out again, \"Let go,\" and William answered, \"Ay, ay!\"\r\nagain, and let it go. Then, as soon as the Captain had secured his yacht\r\nand stowed away the sails, the whole party hurried ashore, and up the\r\npath to the Captain's cottage, for already great drops of rain were\r\nbeginning to patter on the leaves, and the roaring wind was heard among\r\nthe forest trees, giving the first warning cry of a coming shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIn which the Reader will discover, as the Little People\r\ndid, how a Life was saved, and a Life was Begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captain and his little friends had barely reached the cottage when\r\nthe storm came down in earnest. The tall trees bowed their heads beneath\r\nthe heavy blasts of wind, which shook them to their very roots, and the\r\nmusic of the rustling and sighing leaves was heard until the sounds were\r\ndrowned by the fierce, dashing rain.\r\n\r\n\"Now this is a regular blow-hard, and no mistake,\" exclaimed the\r\nCaptain, as the party stood in the doorway watching the bending trees\r\nand the clouds that rushed so wildly overhead. \"Good thing we picked up\r\nour anchor when we did, or just as like as not we should have had to lie\r\nthere all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we couldn't have stayed there in such a storm, could we, Captain\r\nHardy?\" said Fred, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure we could,\" replied the Captain, \"and snug enough too. Yes,\r\nindeed, the little _Alice_ would have ridden out the gale handsomely.\r\nThen we might have stowed ourselves away in the cabin as nice as could\r\nbe, and have been just as dry as we are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And gone without supper,\" put in William, with a practical eye to the\r\ncreature comforts.\r\n\r\n\"Easy there, my lad,\" answered the Captain. \"Do you think you catch an\r\nancient mariner on the water without 'a shot in his locker'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it have been jolly,--eating supper in the cabin,\" exclaimed\r\nWilliam; \"and then, Captain Hardy, would you have gone on with the\r\nstory?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I would,\" answered the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm sorry we didn't stay there,\" replied William.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said the Captain. \"But what says little Alice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather hear the story where we are,\" was the reply. And as the\r\nlightning flashed and the thunder rattled more and more, the little girl\r\ncrept closer to the old man's side.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm glad we came away,\" replied the captain; \"and we'll go right\r\non too, for I see you don't like listening to the storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm dreadfully afraid!\" said Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on! Captain Hardy,\" exclaimed both the boys together.\r\n\r\n\"But where was I when we left off to run away, in such a lubberly\r\nmanner, from the storm?\" inquired the Captain. \"Let me see,\" and he put\r\nhis finger to his nose, looking thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"You were just beginning to cry,\" put in William.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I was, that's it; and so would you cry, too, my boy, if you\r\nhad an empty stomach under your belt, and nothing but a jack-knife in\r\nit,\" answered the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"That I would,\" exclaimed William, \"I should have cried my eyes out.\r\nBut, Captain Hardy,--if you'll excuse me,--was the jack-knife in the\r\nempty stomach or in the belt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you little rogue! I'll not mind _you_ any more,\" said the Captain,\r\nlaughing; \"what would Fred have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I should have broke my heart,\" said Fred, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"That's not so easy done as crying,\" exclaimed the Captain. \"But what\r\nsays little Alice; what would she have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Alice, gently; \"but I think I should have gone\r\nand tried to get the poor boy to speak to me, and then I would have\r\ntried to comfort him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, my charming little girl; that's just exactly what I did. But\r\nit wasn't so easy either, I can tell you; for the boy was still as dull\r\nas ever. I tried to rouse him in every way I could think of; but he\r\nwould not arouse. I spoke to him, I called to him, I shouted to him; but\r\nhe would not answer me a single word.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was his name, Captain Hardy? Won't you tell us his name?\" asked\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that I should have done before; but I forgot it. His name was\r\nRichard Dean. The sailors always called him 'the Dean.' He was a bright,\r\nlively boy, and everybody liked him. To see him in such a state made my\r\nvery heart ache. But he was growing warm under his great load of\r\neider-down, and that I was glad to see; and at last he showed some\r\nfeeble signs of consciousness. His eyes opened wide, his lips moved. I\r\nthought he was saying something, though I could not understand for some\r\ntime what it was. Then I could make out, after a while, that he was\r\nmurmuring, 'Mother, mother!' Then he looked at me, wildly like, and then\r\nhe turned his head away, and then he turned it back and looked at me\r\nagain. 'Hardy,' said he, in a very low voice, 'is that you?' 'Yes,' I\r\nsaid; 'and I'm glad you know me,'--which you may be very sure I was.\r\n\r\n\"But the poor fellow's mind soon wandered away from me again; and I\r\ncould see that it was disturbed by visions of something dreadful.\r\n'There! there!' he cried, 'it's tumbling on me!--the ice! the ice! it's\r\ntumbling on me!' and he tried to spring up from where he lay. 'There's\r\nnothing there at all, Dean,' said I, as I pressed him down. 'Come, look\r\nup; don't you see me?' He was quiet in an instant; and then, looking up\r\ninto my face, he said, 'Yes, it's Hardy, I know; but what has happened\r\nto us,--anything?' Without pausing to give me time to answer, he closed\r\nhis eyes and went on,--'O, I've had an awful dream! I thought an iceberg\r\nwas falling on the ship. I saw it coming, and sprang away! As it fell,\r\nthe ship went down, and I went down with it,--down, down, down; then I\r\ncame up, clinging to some pieces of the wreck. Another man was with me;\r\nwe were drifted with the waves to the land. I kept above the water until\r\nI saw somebody running towards me. When he had nearly reached me, I\r\ndrowned. O, it was an awful dream!--Did you come to call me,\r\nHardy?'--and he opened wide his eyes. 'Is it four bells? Did you come to\r\ncall me?'--'No, no, I haven't come to call you, it isn't four bells\r\nyet,' I answered, scarcely knowing what I said; 'sleep on, Dean.'--'I'm\r\nglad you didn't come to call me, Hardy. I want to sleep. The dream\r\nhaunts me. I dreamed that I was fast to something that hurt me, when I\r\ntried to get away. It was an awful dream,--awful, awful, awful!'--and\r\nhis voice died away into the faintest whisper, and then it ceased\r\nentirely. 'Sleep, sleep on, poor Dean!' murmured I; and I prayed with\r\nall my heart that his reason might not be gone.\r\n\r\n\"'What could I do?' 'What should I do?' were the questions which soon\r\ncrossed my mind respecting the Dean. There was, however, one very\r\nobvious answer,--'Let him alone'; so I rose up from his side, and saw,\r\nas I did so, that he was now sleeping soundly,--a genuine, quiet sleep.\r\nHe had become quite warm; and, after some minutes' watching, it appeared\r\nto me very likely that he would, after a while, wake up all right,--a\r\nconclusion which made me very happy; that is, as happy as one so\r\nsituated could be.\r\n\r\n\"After leaving the Dean I once more considered my condition. It seemed\r\nto me that I had grown many years older in these few hours, and I\r\ncommenced reasoning with myself. Instead of sitting down on the rock,\r\nand beginning to cry, as I had done before, I sat down to reflect. And\r\nthis is the way I reflected:--\r\n\r\n\"'1st,' I said, 'while there is life there is hope'; and,\r\n\r\n\"'2d. So long as the land remains unexplored, I have a right to conclude\r\nthat it is inhabited'; and,\r\n\r\n\"'3d. Being inhabited, there is a good chance of our being saved; for\r\neven the worst savages cannot refuse two such helpless creatures food\r\nand clothing.'\r\n\r\n\"Having thus reflected, I arrived at these conclusions respecting what I\r\nshould do; namely,--\r\n\r\n\"'1st. I will go at once in search of these inhabitants, and when I find\r\nthem, I will beg them to come and help me with a sick companion.'\r\n\r\n\"'2d. On my way I will make my dinner off raw eggs, of which there are\r\nso many hereabout, for I am so frightfully hungry that I can no longer\r\nresist the repulsive food.'\r\n\r\n\"'3d. I will also hunt on my way for some water, as I am so thirsty that\r\nI scarcely know what to do.'\r\n\r\n\"'4th. For the rest I will trust to Providence.'\r\n\r\n\"Having thus resolved, I immediately set out, and in a very few minutes\r\nI had eaten a whole dozen raw eggs,--and that, too, without any disgust\r\nat all. Then, as I walked on a little farther, I discovered that there\r\nwere a multitude of small streams dashing over the rocks, the water\r\nbeing quite pure and clear,--coming from great snow-banks on the\r\nhill-tops, which were melting away before the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Being thus refreshed with meat and drink, it occurred to me to climb up\r\nto an elevation, and see what more I could discover. The ice was very\r\nthick and closely packed together all along the shore; but beyond where\r\nthe wreck had happened the sea was quite open, only a few straggling\r\nbits of field-ice mixed up with a great many icebergs,--indeed, the\r\nicebergs were too thick to be counted. I thought I saw a boat turned\r\nupside down; but it was so far away that I could not make out distinctly\r\nwhat it was. It was clear enough to me that nobody had been saved from\r\nthe wreck except the Dean and myself.\r\n\r\n\"As I looked around, it appeared very evident to me that the land on\r\nwhich I stood was an island.\r\n\r\n\"After hallooing several times, without any other result than to startle\r\na great number of birds, as I had done before, I set out again, briskly\r\njumping from rock to rock, the birds all the while springing up before\r\nme and fluttering away in great flocks. There seemed to be no end to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"As I went along, I soon found that I was turning rapidly to the left,\r\nand that I was not only on an island, but on a very small one at that. I\r\ncould not have been more than two hours in going all the way around it,\r\nalthough I had to clamber most of the way over very stony places,\r\nstopping frequently to shout at the top of my voice, with the hope of\r\nbeing heard by some human beings; but not a soul was there to answer me,\r\nnor could I discover the least sign of anybody ever having been there.\r\n\r\n\"This failure greatly discouraged me, but still I was not so much cast\r\ndown as you might think. Perhaps it was because I had eaten so many\r\neggs, and was no longer hungry; for, let me tell you, when one's stomach\r\ngets empty, the courage has pretty much all gone out of him.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this, I had made some discoveries which seemed in some way to\r\nforebode good, though I could not exactly say why. I found the birds\r\nthicker and thicker as I proceeded. Their nests were in some places so\r\nclose together that I could hardly walk without treading on their eggs.\r\nI also saw several foxes, some of which were white and others were dark\r\ngray. As I walked on, they scampered away over the stones ahead of me,\r\nand then perched themselves on a tall rock near by, apparently very much\r\nastonished to see me. They seemed to look upon me as an intruder, and I\r\nthought they would ask, 'What business have you coming here?' They had\r\nlittle idea how glad I should have been to be almost anywhere else,--on\r\nthe farm from which I had run away, for instance,--and leave them in\r\nundisputed possession of their miserable island. They seemed to be very\r\nsleek and well-contented foxes; for they were gorging themselves with\r\nraw eggs, just as I had been doing, and they were evidently the terror\r\nof the birds. I saw one who had managed in some way to capture a duck\r\nnearly as large as himself, and was bouncing up the hill--to his den, no\r\ndoubt--with the poor thing's neck in his mouth, and its body across his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Then, too, I discovered, from the east side of the island, where the\r\nice was solid, a great number of seals lying in the sun, as if asleep,\r\non the ice; and when I came around on the west side, where the sea was\r\nopen, great schools of walruses, with their long tusks and ugly heads,\r\nwere sporting about in the water as if at play, and an equally large\r\nnumber of the narwhal, with their long horns, were also playing there.\r\nOnly that they are larger, and have these hideous-looking tusks,\r\nwalruses are much like seals. The narwhal is a small species of whale,\r\nbeing about twenty feet long, and spotted something like an iron-gray\r\nhorse. Its great peculiarity is the horn, which grows, like that of a\r\nsword-fish, straight out of the nose, and is nearly half as long as the\r\nbody. Like all the other whales, it must come up to the surface of the\r\nwater to breathe; and its breathing is done through a hole in the top of\r\nthe head, like any other whale's. You know the breathing of a whale is\r\ncalled 'spouting,' or 'blowing,'--that is, when he breathes out it is so\r\ncalled, and when he does this he makes the spray fly up into the air.\r\n\r\n\"This breathing of the largest whales can be seen several miles; that\r\nis, I should say, the spray thrown up by their breath. So you see the\r\ncommon expression of the whale-fishers, 'There she blows!' is a very\r\ngood one; for sometimes, when the whale is very large, the spray looks\r\nlike a small waterspout in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the narwhal, which I have told you about, I saw another kind of\r\nwhale, even smaller still. This is called the white whale, though it\r\nisn't exactly white, but a sort of cream-color. They had no horns,\r\nhowever, like the narwhal; and they skimmed along through the water in\r\ngreat numbers, and very close together, and when they come to the\r\nsurface they breathe so quickly that the noise they make is like a sharp\r\nhiss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Hardy making Discoveries.]\r\n\r\n\"Considering the numbers of these animals,--the seals and walruses and\r\nnarwhals and white whales,--I was not surprised, when I went close down\r\nto the beach, to find a great quantity of their bones there, evidently\r\nof animals that had died in the sea and been washed ashore. Indeed, as\r\nI went along a little farther, and had reached nearly to the place where\r\nI had left the Dean, I found the whole carcass of a narwhal lying among\r\nthe rocks, where it had been thrown by the waves, and very near it I\r\ndiscovered also a dead seal. About these there were several foxes, which\r\nwent scampering away as soon as they saw me. They had evidently come\r\nthere to get their dinner; for they had torn a great hole in the side of\r\nthe dead narwhal, and two of them had begun on the seal. I thought if I\r\ncould get some of the skins of these pretty foxes, they would be nice\r\nwarm things to wrap the Dean's hands and feet in, so I began flinging\r\nstones at them as hard as I could; but the cunning beasts dodged every\r\none of them, and, running away up the hillside, chattered in such a\r\nlively manner that it seemed as if they were laughing at me, which\r\nprovoked me so much that I went on vowing to get the better of them in\r\none way or another.\r\n\r\n\"All this time, you must remember, I had left the poor Dean by himself,\r\nand you may be sure I was very anxious to get back to him; but before I\r\ntell you anything more about him, I must stop a minute longer to\r\ndescribe more particularly this island on which I had been cast away.\r\nYou must understand there were no trees on it at all; and, indeed, there\r\nwere scarcely any signs of vegetation whatever. On the south side, where\r\nwe landed after the wreck, the hillside was covered for a short distance\r\nwith thick grass, and above this green slope there were great tall\r\ncliffs like the palisades of the Hudson River,--which you must all see\r\nsome time; but all the rest of the way around the island I saw scarcely\r\nanything but rough rocks, very sharp and hard to walk over. In some\r\nplaces, however, where the streams of melted snow had spread out in the\r\nlevel places, patches of moss had grown, making a sort of marsh. Here I\r\ndiscovered some flowers in full bloom, and among them were the buttercup\r\nand dandelion, just like what we find in the meadows here, only not a\r\nquarter so large; but my head was too much filled with more serious\r\nthoughts at that time to care about flowers.\r\n\r\n\"You can hardly imagine anything so dreary as this island was. Indeed,\r\nnothing could be worse except the prospect of living on it all alone,\r\nwithout any shelter, or fire, or proper clothing, and without any\r\napparent chance of ever escaping from it.\r\n\r\n\"I found, however, a sort of apology for a tree growing among the moss\r\nbeds. I have learned since that it is called a 'dwarf willow.' The stem\r\nof the tree, if such it might be called, was not larger than my little\r\nfinger; and its branches, which lay flat on the ground, were in no case\r\nmore than a foot long.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these willows, I discovered also, growing about the rocks, a\r\ntrailing plant, with very small stem, and thick, dry leaves. It had a\r\npretty little purple blossom on it, and was the only thing I saw that\r\nlooked as if it would burn. I can assure you that I wished hard enough\r\nthat I had some way of proving whether it would burn or not. However,\r\nsince I had discovered so many other things on this my first journey\r\naround the island, I was not without hope that I should light upon some\r\nway of starting a fire. So I named the plant at once 'the fire plant;'\r\nbut I have since been told by a wise doctor that I met down in Boston,\r\nthat its right name is 'Andromeda.' It is a sort of heather, like the\r\nScotch heather that you have all heard about, only it is as much smaller\r\nthan the Scotch heather as the dwarf willow I told you of is smaller\r\nthan the tall willow-tree that grows out there in front of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Although I had not, as I have said, discovered any natives living on\r\nthe island, yet I came back from my journey feeling less disappointed\r\nthan I would have thought. No doubt my anxiety to see how the Dean was\r\nso occupied my mind that I did not dwell as much upon my own unhappy\r\ncondition as I otherwise would have done. In truth, I think the Dean\r\nmust have saved me from despair and death; for, if I had not felt\r\nobliged to exert myself in his behalf, I must have sunk under the heavy\r\nload of my misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\"When I came back to the Dean, I found that the poor boy was still\r\nsleeping soundly,--a sort of dead, heavy sleep. At first, I thought to\r\narouse him; but then, again, since I found he was quite warm, I\r\nconcluded the best thing was not to disturb him. Some color had come\r\ninto his face; indeed, there was quite a flush there, and he seemed to\r\nbe a little feverish. The only thing I now feared was that his reason\r\nmight have left him; and this thought filled me with a kind of dread of\r\nseeing him rouse up, just as every one, when he fears some great\r\ncalamity, tries to postpone the realization of it as long as possible.\r\nSo I suffered him to remain sleeping, and satisfied myself with watching\r\nhis now somewhat heavy breathing for a little while, when, growing\r\nchilly (for the sun had by this time gone behind the island, thus\r\nleaving us in the shadow of the tall cliffs), I began to move about\r\nagain. I set to work collecting more of the eider-down, so that, when I\r\nshould be freed from my anxiety about the Dean, I might roll myself up\r\nunder this warm covering and get some sleep; for, although my mind was\r\nmuch excited, yet I was growing sleepy, besides being chilly. I also\r\ncollected a number of eggs, and ate some more of them; and, using\r\nseveral of the shells for cups, I brought some water, setting the cups\r\nup carefully in the grass, knowing that when the Dean opened his eyes he\r\nmust needs be thirsty as well as hungry.\r\n\r\n\"All this being done, I fell to reflecting again, and, as was most\r\nnatural, my thoughts first ran upon what I should do to make a fire. I\r\nhad found--or at least I thought I had found--something that would burn,\r\nas I have said before; but what should I do for _the first spark_? True,\r\nwith my jack-knife for a steel, and a flint-stone, of which there were\r\nplenty, I could strike a spark without any difficulty; but what was\r\nthere to strike it into, so that it would catch and make a blaze? I knew\r\nthat in some countries people make a blaze by rubbing two pieces of dry\r\nwood together; but this I could not do, as I had not a particle of wood.\r\nIn other countries, I knew, they have punk, into which they strike a\r\nspark, and the spark will not go out until the punk is all burned up, so\r\nthat they have only to blow it on some inflammable substance until a\r\nblaze comes; but where was I to get the punk from? I had also heard that\r\nfire had been made with lenses of glass, which, being held up to the\r\nsun, concentrate the rays and make a great heat, sufficient to set wood\r\nand like combustible things on fire; but I had no lens. Of course, I\r\nhave no need to tell you that I had no matches, such as we have\r\nnow-a-days here.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the night wore on. I say _night_, but you must bear in mind, as I\r\ntold you before, that there was really no night at all,--the sun being\r\nabove the horizon all the time; and the only difference now in the\r\ndifferent periods of the day was, that when the sun was in the south it\r\nshone upon us, while when it was at the north we were under the shadow\r\nof the cliffs. The sun, you must observe, in the Arctic regions, circles\r\naround during the summer, only a little way above the horizon, never\r\nrising overhead, as it does here, but being always quite low down; and\r\nhence it never gives a very strong heat, although the air is sometimes\r\nwarm enough to be very comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"I was glad when the shadow of the cliff passed from over me, and the\r\nsun was once more in view.\r\n\r\n\"I now grew quite warm, though my great fatigue did not vanish; but I\r\nwas so anxious about the Dean that I would not sleep, and kept myself\r\nawake by moving about all the time, staying always near the Dean. At\r\nlength, soon after the sun appeared, the boy began to show some\r\nrestlessness; and as I approached him, I found that his eyes were wide\r\nopen. He raised himself a little on one arm, and turned towards me as I\r\ncame up to him, and looked straight at me, so calmly and intelligently\r\nthat I saw at once he had come to his senses entirely; and so rejoiced\r\nwas I, that, without thinking at all about what I was doing, I fell down\r\nbeside him, and clasped him in my arms, and cried out, 'O Dean, Dean!'\r\nover and over a great many times. You cannot imagine how glad I was!\r\n\r\n\"'Why, Hardy,' said he, in a very feeble voice, 'where are we? What's\r\nthe matter? What has happened to us?' Seeing that it was useless for me\r\nto attempt to evade the question, I told him all the circumstances of\r\nthe shipwreck, and how I had carried him there, and what I had been\r\ndoing. I thought at first this would disturb him, but it did not seem to\r\nin the least. After I had finished, he simply said: 'I thought it was\r\nall a dream. It comes back to me now. I remember a frightful crash, of\r\nbeing in the water on the wreck, of seeing some one approaching me, of\r\nbeing held down first by a drowning man and then by a rope, of trying to\r\nfree myself, and then I must have swooned, for I remember nothing more.\r\nI have now a vague remembrance of some one talking to me about a dream I\r\nhad, but nothing distinct.'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' said I, 'Dean, don't talk any more about it just now, it will\r\nfatigue you; tell me how you feel.' 'No,' answered he, 'it does not\r\nfatigue me, and I want to collect myself. Things are getting clearer to\r\nme. My memory returns to me gradually. I see the terrified crew. It was\r\nbut an instant. I heard the crash. The great body of the ice fell right\r\namidships,--right upon the galley. Poor cook! he must have been killed\r\ninstantly. Some of the crew jumped overboard; I tried to, but got no\r\nfarther than the bulwarks, and then was in the water; I don't know how I\r\ngot there. When I came up there was a man under me, and I was tangled\r\namong some rigging, but was lifted up out of the water on some large\r\nmass of wreck. The man I told you of tried to get up too; but his feet\r\nwere caught, and I saw him drowning. I saw another man holding on to the\r\nwreck, but a piece of ice struck him, and he must have fallen off\r\nimmediately.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dean, Dean!' said I, 'do stop! you are feverish; quiet yourself, and\r\nwe'll talk of these things by and by';--and the boy fell back quite\r\nexhausted. His skin was very hot, and his face flushed. 'O my head, my\r\nhead!' exclaimed he; 'it pains me dreadfully! Am I hurt?' and he put his\r\nhand to the side of his head where he had been struck, and, finding that\r\nhe was wounded, said: 'I remember it now perfectly. A heavy wave came,\r\nand was tossing a piece of timber over me, and I tried to avoid being\r\nstruck by it. After that I remember nothing. It must have struck me. I'm\r\nnot much hurt,--am I?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, Dean,' I answered, 'not much hurt, only a little bruised.'\r\n\r\n\"'Have you any water, Hardy?' he asked, 'I am so thirsty!'\r\n\r\n\"It was fortunate that I had brought some in the eggshells, and in a\r\nmoment I had given him a drink. It did me good to see him smile, as I\r\nhanded him the water, and ask where I got such odd cups from. 'Thanks,\r\nthanks!' said he; 'I'm better now.' Then after a moment's pause he\r\nadded, 'I want to get up and see where we are. I'm very weak; won't you\r\nhelp me?' But I told him that I would not do it now, for the present he\r\nmust lie quiet. 'Then raise me up and let me look about.' So I raised\r\nhim up, and he took first a look at the strange pile of eider-down that\r\nwas upon him, and then at the ice-covered sea, but he spoke not a word.\r\nThen he lay down, and after a short time said calmly: 'I see it all now.\r\nHard,--isn't it? But we must do the best we can. I feel that I'll soon\r\nbe well, and will not be a trouble to you long. Do you know that until\r\nthis moment I could hardly get it out of my head that I had been\r\ndreaming? We must trust in Heaven, Hardy, and do the best we can.'\r\n\r\n\"Being now fully satisfied as to the complete recovery of the Dean, I\r\ngave myself no further concern about watching him; but at once, after he\r\nhad, in his quiet way, asked me if I was not very tired, I buried myself\r\nup in the heap of eider-down close beside him, and was soon as deeply\r\nburied in a sound sleep.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Captain, evidently thinking that he had gone far enough for one day,\r\nnow broke off suddenly. The children had listened to the recital more\r\neagerly than on any previous occasion,--so much so, indeed, that they\r\nhad wholly disregarded the storm; and little Alice was so absorbed in\r\nlearning the fate of the poor shipwrecked Dean, that her fears about the\r\nthunder and lightning had been quite forgotten. When the Captain paused,\r\nthe storm had passed over, the sun had burst through the scattering\r\nclouds, and in the last lingering drops his silver rays were melted into\r\ngorgeous hues; for\r\n\r\n    \"A rainbow--thrown brightly\r\n        Across the dark sky--\r\n    (Soft curving, proud arching\r\n        In beauty on high)\r\n\r\n    \"Had circled the even,--\r\n        A bridal ring, given\r\n    To wed earth with heaven,\r\n        As it smiled 'neath the veil of the glittering rain.\"\r\n\r\nThe little birds had come out of their hiding-places, and were merrily\r\nsinging,\r\n\r\n\"Farewell to the rain, the beautiful rain\";\r\n\r\nand the party of little folks that had been hidden away in the\r\n\"Mariner's Rest,\" following their example, were soon gayly hastening\r\nacross the fresh fields,--the old man carrying laughing Alice in his\r\narms, to keep her tender feet from the wet grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIn which the Mariner's Rest and the Ancient Mariner\r\nhimself receive particular Attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next day being Sunday, the Captain's little friends did not go down\r\nto see him, and the day after being stormy, they could not. So, when\r\nTuesday came, they were all the more eager for the visit that it had\r\nbeen delayed; and accordingly they hurried off at a very early hour.\r\nIndeed, the old man was only too glad to have them come down at any\r\ntime, for he had during these past few days become so used to their\r\nbeing with him, and he had taken such a fancy to them, that he felt\r\nhimself quite lost and lonely when a day passed by without seeing them.\r\nHe was, as we have already seen, rather afraid they might disturb him if\r\nhe said, \"Come at any hour you please,\" instead of \"Come at four\r\no'clock, or three, or two o'clock,\" as the case might be; but he had\r\ndiscovered them to be such well-behaved and gentle children, that he\r\nmade up his mind they could never trouble or annoy him. So when last\r\nthey parted, he said to them, \"Come in the morning, if you like, and\r\nplay all day about the grounds, and if I have work to do you must not\r\nmind. Nobody will disturb you\";--and, in truth, there was nobody there\r\nto disturb them, for besides the old man and his boy, Main Brace, there\r\nwas no living thing about the house, if we except two fine old\r\nNewfoundland dogs which the Captain had brought home with him from his\r\nlast voyage, and which he called \"Port\" and \"Starboard.\" He had also a\r\nflock of handsome chickens, and some foreign ducks. \"And now,\" said he,\r\n\"when you have seen all these, and Main Brace, and me, you have seen my\r\nfamily, for this is all the family that I have, unless I count the\r\npretty little birds that hop and skip and sing among the trees.\"\r\n\r\nMain Brace did all the work about the house, except what the Captain did\r\nhimself. He cooked, and set the Captain's table, and kept the Captain's\r\nhouse in order generally. As for the house itself, there was not much of\r\nit to keep in order. We have already seen that it was very small and but\r\none story high. There was no hall in it, and only five rooms upon the\r\nfloor. Let us look into it more particularly.\r\n\r\nEntering it from the front through the little porch covered over with\r\nhoneysuckle vines that are smelling sweet all the summer through, we\r\ncome at once into the largest of the rooms, where the Captain takes his\r\nmeals and does many other things. But he never calls it his dining-room.\r\nNothing can induce him to call it anything but his \"quarter-deck.\" On\r\nthe right-hand side there are two doors, and there are two more on the\r\nleft-hand side, and directly before us there are two windows, looking\r\nout into the Captain's garden, where there are fruits and vegetables of\r\nevery kind growing in abundance. The first door on the right opens into\r\na little room where Main Brace sleeps. This the Captain calls the\r\n\"forecastle.\" The other door on the right opens into the kitchen, which\r\nthe Captain calls his \"galley.\" The first door on the left is closed,\r\nbut the second opens into what the Captain calls his \"cabin,\" and this\r\nconnects with a little room behind the door that is closed, which he\r\ncalls his \"state-room,\"--and, in truth, it looks more like a state-room\r\nof a ship than a chamber. It has no bed in it, but a narrow berth on one\r\nside, just like a state-room berth. All sorts of odd-fashioned clothes\r\nare hanging on the walls, which the Captain says he has worn in the\r\ndifferent countries where he has travelled. Odd though this state-room\r\nis, it is not half so odd as the Captain's cabin.\r\n\r\nLet us examine this cabin of the Captain. There is an old table in the\r\ncentre of it. There are a few old books in an old-fashioned bookcase.\r\nThere is no carpet to be seen, but the floor is almost covered over with\r\nskins of different kinds of animals, among which are a Bengal tiger, a\r\nPolar bear, a South American ocelot, a Rocky Mountain wolf, and a\r\nSiberian fox. In a great glass case, standing against the wall, there is\r\na variety of stuffed birds. On the very top of this case there is a huge\r\nwhite-headed eagle, with his large wings spread out, and at the bottom\r\nof it there is a pelican with no wings at all. On the right-hand side\r\nthere is an enormous albatross, and on the left-hand side there is a\r\ntall red flamingo; while in the very centre a snowy owl stands straight\r\nup and looks straight at you out of his great glass eyes. And then there\r\nare still other birds,--birds little and birds big, birds bright and\r\nbirds dingy, all scattered about wherever there is room, each sitting or\r\nstanding on its separate perch, and looking, for all the world, as if\r\nit were alive and would fly away only for the glass.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of this singular room are hanging all sorts of singular\r\nweapons, and many other things which the Captain has picked up in his\r\ntravels. There is a Turkish scimitar, a Moorish gun, an Italian\r\nstiletto, a Japanese \"happy despatch,\" a Norman battle-axe, besides\r\nspears and lances and swords of shapes and kinds too numerous to\r\nmention. In one corner, on a bracket, there is a model of a ship, in\r\nanother a Chinese junk, in a third an old Dutch clock, and in the fourth\r\nthere is a stone idol of the Incas, while above the door there is the\r\nfigure-head of a small vessel, probably a schooner.\r\n\r\nWhen the children came down, running all the way at a very lively rate,\r\nthe Captain was in his cabin overhauling all these treasures, and\r\ndusting and placing them so that they would show to the very best\r\nadvantage. Indeed, there were so many \"traps,\" as he called them,\r\nhanging and lying about, that the place might well have been called a\r\n\"curiosity shop\" rather than a cabin. In truth, it had nothing of the\r\nlook of a cabin about it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Captain heard the children coming, he said to himself, \"I'll\r\ngive them a surprise to-day,\" and he looked out through the open window,\r\nand called to them. They answered with a merry laugh, and, running\r\naround to the door, rushed into the \"quarter-deck,\" and were with the\r\nCaptain in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\"O, what a jolly place!\" exclaimed William; \"such a jolly lot of things!\r\nWhy didn't you show them to us before, Captain Hardy?\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing at a time, my lad; I can't show you everything at once,\"\r\nanswered the old man.\r\n\r\n\"But where did you get them all, Captain Hardy?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that, I picked them up all about the world, and I could tell a\r\nstory about every one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, isn't that splendid?--won't you tell us now?\" inquired William.\r\n\r\n\"And knock off telling you what the Dean and I were doing up there by\r\nthe North Pole, on that island without a name?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam was a little puzzled to know what reply he should make to that,\r\nfor he thought the Captain looked as if he did not half like what he had\r\nsaid; so he satisfied himself with exclaiming, \"No, no, no,\" a great\r\nnumber of times, and then asked, \"But won't you tell us all about them\r\nwhen you get out of the North Pole scrape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe so, my lad, maybe so; we'll see about that; one thing at a time\r\nis a good rule in story-telling as well as in other matters. And now you\r\nmay look at all these things, and when you are satisfied, and I have got\r\ndone putting them to rights, we'll go on with the story again.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were greatly delighted with everything they saw, and they\r\npassed a very happy hour, helping the Captain to put his cabin in\r\n\"ship-shape order,\" as he said. Then they all crowded up into one\r\ncorner, and the Captain, seated on an old camp-stool, which had\r\nevidently seen much service in a great number of places, did as he had\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nWhat he said, however, deserves a chapter by itself; and so we'll turn\r\nanother leaf and start fresh again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nContains a Recovery, a Discovery, and a Disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said the Captain, \"what was the young man doing, when we\r\nknocked off the other day, after the storm?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam, whose memory was always as good as his words were ready, said\r\nhe was \"just going to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, that's the thing; and I went to sleep and slept soundly, I can\r\ntell you. And this you may well enough believe when you bear in mind how\r\nmuch I had passed through since the last sleep I had on board the\r\nship,--for since then had come the shipwreck, the saving of the Dean and\r\ncarrying him ashore, the walk around the island, besides all the anxiety\r\nand worriment of mind in consequence of my own unhappy situation and the\r\nDean's uncertain fate.\r\n\r\n\"More than twenty-four hours had elapsed since the shipwreck, and if I\r\ntell you that I slept full twelve hours, without once waking up, you\r\nmust not be at all surprised.\r\n\r\n\"When I opened my eyes again, we were in the shadow of the cliffs once\r\nmore; that is, the sun had gone around to the north again. The Dean was\r\nalready wide awake. When I asked him how he was, he said he felt much\r\nbetter, only his head still pained him greatly, and he was very thirsty\r\nand hungry.\r\n\r\n\"I got up immediately, and assisted the Dean to rise. He was a little\r\ndizzy at first, but after sitting down for a few minutes on a rock he\r\nrecovered himself. Then I brought him some water in an egg-shell to\r\ndrink. And then I gave him a raw egg, which he swallowed as if it had\r\nbeen the daintiest morsel in the world. 'It's lucky, isn't it,' said he,\r\n'that there are so many eggs about?' After a moment I observed that he\r\nwas laughing, which very much surprised me, as that would have been\r\nabout the last thing that ever would have entered into my head to do.\r\n'Do you know,' he asked, 'what a very ridiculous figure we are cutting?\r\nLook, we are all covered over with feathers. I have heard of people\r\nbeing tarred and feathered, but never heard of anything like this. Let's\r\npick each other.'\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough we were literally covered over with the down in which we\r\nhad been sleeping, and when I saw what a jest the poor Dean, with his\r\nsore head, made of the plight we were in, I forgot all my own troubles\r\nand joined in the laugh with him.\r\n\r\n\"We now fell to work picking each other, as the Dean had suggested, and\r\nwere soon as clean of feathers as any other well-plucked geese.\r\n\r\n\"By this time the Dean's clothes had become entirely dry; so each\r\ndressed himself in the clothes that belonged to him, and then we started\r\nover to the nearest brook, where we bathed our hands and faces, drying\r\nthem on an old bandanna handkerchief which I was lucky enough to have in\r\nmy pocket. I had to support the Dean a little as we went along, for he\r\nwas very weak; but in spite of this his spirits were excellent, and when\r\nhe saw, for the first time, the ducks fly up, he said, 'What a great\r\npair of silly dunces they must take us for,--coming into such a place as\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n\"After we had refreshed ourselves at the brook, and eaten some more\r\neggs, we very naturally began to talk. I related to the Dean, more\r\nparticularly than I had done before, the events of the shipwreck and our\r\nescape, and what I had discovered on the island, and then made some\r\nallusion to the prospect ahead of us. To my great surprise, the Dean was\r\nnot apparently in the least cast down about it. In truth, he took it\r\nmuch more resignedly, and had a more hopeful eye to the future, than I\r\nhad. 'If,' said he, 'it is God's will that we shall live, he will\r\nfurnish us the means; if not, we can but die. I wouldn't mind it half so\r\nmuch, if my poor mother only knew what was become of me.' This\r\nreflection seemed to sadden him for a moment, and I thought I saw a tear\r\nin his eye; but he brightened up instantly as a great flock of ducks\r\nwent whizzing overhead. 'Well,' exclaimed he, 'there seems to be no lack\r\nof something to eat here anyway, and we ought to manage to catch it\r\nsomehow, and live until a ship comes along and takes us off.'\r\n\r\n\"The Dean took such a hopeful view of the future that we were soon\r\nchatting in a very lively way about everything that concerned our\r\nescape, and here I must have dwelt largely upon the satisfaction which I\r\ntook in rescuing the Dean, for the little fellow said: 'Well, I suppose\r\nI ought to thank you very much for saving me; but the truth is, all the\r\nagony of death being over with me when you pulled me out, the chief\r\nbenefit falls on you, as you seem so much rejoiced about it; but I'll be\r\ngrateful as I can, and show it by not troubling you any more. See, I'm\r\nalmost well. I feel better and better every minute,--only I'm sore here\r\non the head where I got the crack.'\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, in thinking of other things, I had neglected, or\r\nrather quite forgotten, the Dean's wounded head; so now, my attention\r\nbeing called to it, I examined it very carefully, and found that it was\r\nnothing more than a bad bruise, with a cut near the centre of it about\r\nhalf an inch long. Having washed it carefully, I bound my bandanna\r\nhandkerchief about it, and we once more came back to consider what we\r\nshould do.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, the first thing we thought of and talked about was how we\r\nshould go about starting a fire; next in importance to this was that we\r\nshould have a place to shelter us. So far as concerned our food and\r\ndrink, our immediate necessities were provided for, as we had the little\r\nrivulet close at hand, and any quantity of eggs to be had for the\r\ngathering, and we set about collecting a great number of them at once;\r\nfor in a few days we thought it very likely that most of them would have\r\nlittle ducks in them, as, indeed, many of them had already. Another\r\nthing we settled upon was, that we would never both go to sleep at the\r\nsame time, nor quit our present side of the island together; but one of\r\nus would be always on the lookout for a ship, as we both thought that,\r\nsince our ship had come that way, others would be very likely to, though\r\nneither of us had the remotest idea in the world as to where we were,\r\nany more than that we were on an island somewhere in the northern sea.\r\n\r\n\"But the fire which we wanted so much to warm ourselves and cook our\r\nfood,--what should we do for that? Here was the great question; and\r\nfire, fire, fire, was the one leading idea running through both our\r\nheads;--we thought of fire when we were gathering eggs, we talked of\r\nfire when, later in the day, we sat upon the rocks, resting ourselves,\r\nand we dreamed of fire when we fell asleep again,--not this time,\r\nhowever, under the eider-down where we had slept before, but on the\r\ngreen grass of the hillside, in the warm sunshine, under my overcoat,\r\nfor we had turned night into day, and were determined to sleep when the\r\nsun was shining on us at the south, and do what work we had to do when\r\nwe were in the shade.\r\n\r\n\"Every method that either of us had ever heard of for making a fire was\r\nremembered and talked over; but there was nothing that appeared to suit\r\nour case. I found a hard flint, and by striking it on the back of my\r\nknife-blade I saw that there was no difficulty in getting any number of\r\nsparks, but we had nothing that would catch the sparks when struck; so\r\nthat we did not seem to be any better off than we were before; and, as I\r\nhave stated already, we fell asleep again, each in his turn,--'watch and\r\nwatch,' as the Dean playfully called it, and as they have it on\r\nshipboard,--without having arrived at any other result than that of\r\nbeing much discouraged.\r\n\r\n\"When we had been again refreshed with sleep, we determined to make a\r\nstill further exploration of the island; so, after once more eating our\r\nfill of raw eggs, we set out. The Dean, being still weak and his head\r\nstill paining him very much from the hurt, remained at the lookout. He\r\ncould, however, walk up and down for a few hundred yards without losing\r\nsight of the only part of the sea that was free enough of ice to allow a\r\nship to approach the island. After a while he came to where I had\r\ndiscovered the dead seal and narwhal lying on the beach, when upon my\r\nfirst journey round the island. I had told him about them, as indeed I\r\nhad of everything I had seen, and he was curious to try if he could not\r\ncatch a fox; but his fortune in that particular was not better than\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I had a very profitable journey, as I found a place among\r\nthe rocks which might, with some labor in fixing it up, give us shelter.\r\nI was searching for a cave, but nothing of the sort could I come across;\r\nbut at the head of a little valley, very near to where I left the Dean,\r\nI discovered a place that would, in some measure at least, answer the\r\nsame purpose. Its situation gave it the still further advantage, that we\r\ncommanded a perfect view of the sea from the front of it.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that it was not exactly a cave. It was rather a natural\r\ntent, as it were, of solid rocks. At the foot of a very steep slope\r\nthere were several large masses of rough rocks heaped together,\r\nevidently having one day slid down from the cliffs above, and afterwards\r\nsmaller rocks, being broken off, had piled up behind them. Two of these\r\nlarge rocks had come together in such a manner as to leave an open space\r\nbetween them. I should say this space was ten or twelve feet across at\r\nthe bottom, and, rising up about ten feet high, joined at the top like\r\nthe roof of a house. The rocks were pressed against them behind, so as\r\ncompletely to close the outlet in that direction. I climbed into this\r\nplace, and was convinced that if we had strength to close up the front\r\nentrance with a wall, we should have a complete protection from the\r\nweather. But then, when I reflected how, if we did seek shelter there,\r\nwe should keep ourselves warm, I had great misgivings; for then came up\r\nthe question of all questions, 'What should we do for a fire?'\r\n\r\n\"Although this place was not a cave, yet I spoke to the Dean about it as\r\nsuch, and by that name we came to know it; so I will now use the term,\r\ninappropriate though it is. I also told the Dean about some other birds\r\nthat I had discovered in great numbers. They were very small, and seemed\r\nto have their nests among the rocks all along the opposite side of the\r\nisland, where they were swarming on the hillside, and flying overhead in\r\neven greater flocks than the ducks. I knew they were called 'little\r\nauks,' from descriptions the sailors had given me of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dean makes provision for a change of diet.]\r\n\r\n\"'But look here what I've got,' exclaimed the Dean, with an air of\r\ntriumph, as soon as I came up with him. 'See this big duck!'\r\n\r\n\"The fellow had actually caught a duck, and in a most ingenious manner.\r\nSeeing the ducks fly off their nests, the happy idea struck him that, if\r\nhe could only contrive a trap, or 'dead-fall,' he might catch them when\r\nthey came back. So he selected a nest favorable to his purpose, and\r\nthen piled up some stones about it, making a solid wall on one side of\r\nit; then he put a thin narrow stone on the other side, and on this he\r\nsupported still another stone that was very heavy. Then he took from his\r\npocket a piece of twine which he was fortunate enough to have, and tied\r\none end of it to the thin narrow stone, and, holding on to the other\r\nend, hid himself behind some rocks near by. When the duck came back to\r\nher nest, he jerked the thin narrow stone away by a strong pull on the\r\ntwine string, and down came the heavy stone upon the duck's back. 'You\r\nshould have heard the old thing quacking,' said he, evidently forgetting\r\neverything else but the sport of catching the bird: 'but I soon gave her\r\nneck a twist, and here we are ready for a dinner, when we only find a\r\nway to cook it. Have you discovered any way to make a fire yet?'\r\n\r\n\"I had to confess that on the subject of fire I was yet as ignorant as\r\never.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know,' continued he, 'that I have got an idea?'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' replied he, 'you told me something about people making fire with\r\na lens made of glass. Now, as I was down on the beach and looked at the\r\nice there, I thought, why not make a lens out of ice,--it is as clear as\r\nglass?'\r\n\r\n\"'How ridiculous!' said I; 'but suppose you could, what will you set on\r\nfire with it?'\r\n\r\n\"'In the first place,' he answered, 'the pockets of my coat are made of\r\nsome sort of cotton stuff, and if we could only set fire to that,\r\ncouldn't we blow a blaze into the fire plant, as you call it? See, I've\r\ngathered a great heap of it.' And sure enough he had, for there was a\r\npile of it nearly as high as his head, looking like a great heap of dry\r\nand green leaves.\r\n\r\n\"The idea did not seem to me to be worth much, but still, as it was the\r\nonly one that had been suggested by either of us, it was at least worthy\r\nof trial; so we went down to the beach, and, finding a lump of ice about\r\ntwice as big as my two fists, we began chipping it with my knife into\r\nthe shape we wanted it, and then we ground it off with a stone, and then\r\nrubbed it over with our warm hands until we had worn it down perfectly\r\nsmooth, and into the shape of a lens. This done, we held it up to the\r\nsun, relieving each other as our hands grew cold; but without any\r\nsuccess whatever. We tried for a long time, and with much patience,\r\nuntil the ice became so much melted, that we could do nothing more with\r\nit, when we threw it away, and the experiment was abandoned as hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Our disappointment at this failure was as great as the Dean's hopes had\r\nbeen high. The Dean felt it most, for he was, at the very outset,\r\nperfectly confident of success. Neither of us, however, wished to own\r\nhow much we felt the failure, so we spoke very little more together, but\r\nmade, almost in silence, another meal off the raw eggs, and, being now\r\nquite worn out and weary with the labors and anxieties of the day, we\r\npassed the next twelve hours in watching and sleeping alternately in the\r\nbright sunshine, lying as before on the green grass, covered with the\r\novercoat. We did not even dare hope for better fortune on the morrow. We\r\nhad, however, made up our minds to struggle in the best manner we could\r\nagainst the difficulties which surrounded us, and mutually to sustain\r\neach other in the hard battle before us. Whether we should live or die\r\nwas known but to God alone, and to his gracious protection we once more\r\ncommended ourselves; the Dean repeating a prayer which he had learned\r\nfrom a pious and careful mother, who had brought him up in the fear of\r\nHeaven, and taught him, at a very early age, to have faith in God's\r\nendless watchfulness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my children,\" concluded the Captain, \"I have some work to do\r\nin my garden, to-day, so we must cut our story short this time. When you\r\ncome to-morrow, I will tell you what next we did towards raising a fire,\r\nbesides many other things for our safety and comfort.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the party scattered from the \"cabin,\"--the Captain to his work, and\r\nthe children to play for a while with the Captain's dogs, Port and\r\nStarboard, out among the trees; and to talk with Main Brace, whom they\r\nfound to be the most singular boy they had ever seen; after which they\r\nwent to the Captain to say \"Good evening\" to him, and then ran briskly\r\nhome,--William eager to write down what he had heard, while it was yet\r\nfresh upon his memory, and all of them to relate to their parents, over\r\nand over again, what this wonderful old man had been telling them, and\r\nwhat a dear old soul he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nShows how Some Things may be done as well as Others,\r\nwith God's Help and with much Perseverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the children next went to the \"Mariner's Rest,\" it was unanimously\r\nagreed that they should go back again to the Captain's \"cabin,\"--there\r\nwere so many things that they had not seen, and which they wished to\r\nlook at. Alice wanted to see the birds,--the owl with the great, big\r\neyes, and the pelican that had no wings, at least only little stumps\r\nthat were hardly an apology for wings. Fred wanted to see the Chinese\r\njunks and the little ship, while William was bent on having the Moorish\r\ngun, the Turkish sword, the Japanese \"happy despatch,\" and all the other\r\nweapons, offensive and defensive, taken down, that he might have a\r\nbetter view of them. The old man, at all times very ready and willing to\r\ngratify his little friends, was never more so than when he found them so\r\nmuch interested in the contents of his cabin; for every little curiosity\r\nor treasure there had an association with some period of his eventful\r\nlife, and he was never happier than when any one admired what he admired\r\nso much, and thus gave him a chance to talk about it.\r\n\r\n\"Heyday!\" said he, when all the children had spoken and made known their\r\nwishes, \"I'm glad you take so kindly to the old man's den; you shall\r\ncome down there and look at it whenever you like, only you mustn't toss\r\nthe things about too much. Run in now, and make yourselves at home.\r\nI'll be with you in a little while.\"\r\n\r\nSo the children set off without another word, and were quickly diving\r\namong the old man's treasures, while the Captain went back to his garden\r\nto finish the hoeing of his cabbages.\r\n\r\nWhen the Captain had completed what he was about, he rejoined the\r\nchildren; and after a great deal of conversation which there is no need\r\nthat we should here repeat, the party at length sobered down as if they\r\nwere bent on business, and the Captain, once more drawing his little\r\nfriends about him by the open window, again took up the tale.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Now I told you yesterday,\" said he, \"that the Dean and I had gone\r\nasleep again after all our work and trouble and anxiety, without having\r\ncome any nearer to getting up a fire. You have seen that we had enough\r\nto eat and drink, and that I had found a place to shelter us if a storm\r\ncame on; but nothing could either of us think of to catch a spark. As\r\nsoon as the Dean had opened his eyes, he said: 'Why, this is too bad!\r\nindeed it is,--I thought I had been making a fire.'\r\n\r\n\"'What with?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'With matches, to be sure,' answered the Dean. 'I thought I had a great\r\nload of them in my pocket.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said I, 'I'm sure I pity you, to wake up out of such a pleasant\r\ndream; for you'll find no matches here, nor any fire either, nor do I\r\nthink we shall ever have any.'\r\n\r\n\"'O, don't say that, Hardy,' replied the Dean, sadly, 'I don't think we\r\nare so bad off as to say we never will have any fire. Do you really\r\nthink we are?'\r\n\r\n\"'I can't say,' I replied; 'but what can we do?'\r\n\r\n\"'Try again,' answered the Dean;--and we were soon once more upon our\r\nfeet, both very determined to do something, but neither of us knowing\r\nexactly what it should be.\r\n\r\n\"So we set off to inspect the cave which I told you of yesterday. The\r\nDean was much pleased with it, and, seeing nothing better to do, we both\r\nwent to work at once to build up a wall in front of it, feeling very sad\r\nand sorrowful as we worked in silence. But in spite of our gloomy\r\nthoughts we made good progress, and had soon a solid foundation laid;\r\nbut as we went on, it was plain enough to see that our wall was likely\r\nto be of very little account, since we had no way of filling up the\r\ncracks between the stones.\r\n\r\n\"This set us once more to thinking. Down below us in the valley there\r\nwas plenty of moss, or rather turf; but when we tried to pull it up with\r\nour hands, we discovered that we could do nothing with it, and we wished\r\nfor something to dig with. Then I remembered the bones I had found on\r\nthe beach; so I told the Dean about them, and we both agreed that they\r\nmight be of use to us. The thing which I first thought of was the dead\r\nnarwhal with the great long horn; and I imagined that, if we could only\r\nget that out of his head, we should have all we wanted.\r\n\r\n\"When the Dean and I went down to the narwhal, we foresaw that our task\r\nwould be even greater than we had supposed; for the horn which we were\r\nafter was so firmly embedded in the skull and flesh that it promised to\r\nbe a very serious work to get it out.\r\n\r\n\"First, we had to cut away the flesh and fat from the thick nose, until\r\nwe exposed the skull, and then we had to break the horn loose by\r\ndropping heavy stones upon the socket. At length we were successful. But\r\nwe had consumed almost the whole day about it, and we found ourselves\r\nvery much fatigued; so we sat down upon the green grass, and rested and\r\ntalked for a while, before going back to work upon the wall again. The\r\nhorn was very heavy, but it answered our purpose; and we were soon\r\ndigging up the moss with it, and then we carried the moss up to help\r\nmake out the wall. This moss was very soft, being full of water; and it\r\nfitted with the stones as nicely as any mason's mortar, so that we had\r\nno more trouble in making the wall perfectly tight and solid. Nor did we\r\nhave any trouble in building up a little fireplace and chimney along\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\"We had some discussion as to what use there was in taking all this\r\npains, since we had no fire to put in our fireplace. But then, if we\r\nshould in the end find that we could make a fire, we saw that we would\r\nhave to tear the wall down again if we did not build the fireplace and\r\nchimney up at once; therefore it was clearly better to take a little\r\nextra trouble now, and save it possibly in the end,--an observation that\r\nmight apply to people who were never cast away in the cold, and did not\r\nhave to build chimneys without knowing what use to put them to.\r\n\r\n\"We labored very hard, and were well satisfied with the progress we had\r\nmade, when we found it necessary to knock off, and eat some more raw\r\neggs, and sleep away our fatigue again.\r\n\r\n\"By this time we had grown tired enough of these raw eggs, and, in\r\ntruth, were very sick of them. But we had nothing else to eat unless we\r\nshould devour the duck which the Dean had caught; and this we could\r\nnever, as we thought, bring ourselves to do, uncooked as it was.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean had by this time grown pretty strong again, but still he was\r\nso weak that I should not have allowed him to work had he not insisted\r\nupon it; so, when his turn came to go to sleep, I was glad to be at work\r\nby myself, and I much surprised the Dean, when he got up again, with\r\nwhat I had done.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know what I was thinking of?' said the Dean, as we paused to\r\nrest, after we had again worked awhile together.\r\n\r\n\"'What's that?' said I; 'for I dare say it's something clever, as you\r\nhave a wise head on your young shoulders, Dean.'\r\n\r\n\"'Thank you,' said the Dean; 'being cast away in the cold don't stop us\r\nfrom paying compliments, anyway; but I was thinking that we ought to\r\nsave all the blubber of that old narwhal down there; we'll want the oil\r\nby and by.'\r\n\r\n\"'What for?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'To burn,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'Nonsense!' said I; 'how are you going to burn it?'\r\n\r\n\"'That's just what we're going to find out,' said the Dean; 'we'll get a\r\nfire somehow, of that I'm sure.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should like to know how,' said I. 'Perhaps you have another bright\r\nidea.'\r\n\r\n\"'To be sure I have,' answered the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"'What is it this time?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I don't know,' said he, 'as there's much in it, but I'm going to\r\ntry the lens again.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's of no use,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm not so sure,' said he; 'you know we made a great deal of heat with\r\nour lens the other time,--so much that it almost burned my hand. I think\r\nthe trouble was in my old pocket, which, having once been in salt water,\r\nwouldn't burn; now I think I've found out something that is better.'\r\n\r\n\"'What's that?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, some cotton stuff,' said he, 'that I found blowing about among\r\nthe stones.'\r\n\r\n\"'Cotton!' I exclaimed, in great surprise; 'there's no cotton growing\r\nhere.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, it looks like cotton for all that,' answered the Dean, 'and I'm\r\nsure it will burn. Let me get some of it, and I'll try it.'\r\n\r\n\"So the Dean ran off, and soon came back again with a little wad of\r\nwhite stuff, that looked very much like cotton, only much finer in its\r\ntexture. I remembered it perfectly, for I had seen it, everywhere I\r\nwent, about the little willow-bushes; and I had even plucked a\r\nwillow-blossom to find it covered all over with this tender cotton-like\r\nsubstance, which I blew from it with my breath. But the idea had never\r\nonce come into my head that it would be of any use.\r\n\r\n\"'What are you going to do with this?' said I to the Dean, when he had\r\nshowed it to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' said he, with much confidence, 'I'm going to make another lens\r\nof ice, and set fire to it.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Striking fire under difficulties.\"]\r\n\r\n\"To set fire to it was something easier said than done, yet the idea\r\nseemed to take root in my mind; and how or why it ever came about I can\r\nno more tell than I can fly, but somehow or other, it matters not what\r\nwas my impulse or idea or expectation, the truth is, without saying a\r\nsingle word, I pulled out my knife and the bit of flint which I had\r\nfound and carefully preserved the day before, and then struck one upon\r\nthe other (as if it were quite mechanical) above the Dean's little bit\r\nof cotton stuff, which lay upon the grass. A great shower of sparks was\r\nthrown off with each fresh stroke, and these told of the fineness of the\r\nsteel and the hardness of the flint. I went on pounding and pounding\r\naway, as if resolved on something. And if I was resolved, my resolution\r\nwas rewarded; for at length the Dean threw up his hands as suddenly as\r\nif a shot had struck him in the heart, and he shouted out, 'A spark, a\r\nspark!'\r\n\r\n\"The Dean's little bit of cotton stuff had taken fire, and the\r\ndaintiest little streak of smoke was curling upward from it.\r\n\r\n\"Without pausing an instant, quick as the hawk to swoop down upon its\r\nprey, quick as the lightning-flash, quick as thought itself, I threw\r\naway my knife and flint, and caught up the spark. The Dean drew\r\ninstantly from his pocket the bit of cotton cloth which we had tried to\r\nlight with the lens the day before, and thrust it in my hand. I put the\r\nspark upon it, and then blew.\r\n\r\n\"The first breath drove all the Dean's light cotton stuff away, and the\r\nspark was gone.\r\n\r\n\"But we were now no longer where we were before. The Spark had been made\r\nonce, and it could be made again; and our hearts were bounding with\r\ndelight. 'Hurrah! hurrah!' shouted the Dean, 'we're all right now!'\r\n\r\n\"But our troubles about the fire were very far from ended. We had no\r\ndifficulty in getting another spark to catch in another piece of this\r\nstrange sort of tinder, of which we found great plenty near at hand. But\r\nit would not blaze. With the slightest breath it vanished almost as a\r\nflash of powder; and it was long before we hit upon anything that would\r\ndo us any further good. We tried all the pieces of cotton cloth that we\r\nhad about our clothes, picking it into shreds, and, putting the lighted\r\ntinder among these shreds, tried to make them blaze. But no blaze could\r\nwe get. Once only did we raise a little flash, but it was gone in a\r\nsingle instant. We tried the dry leaves of the fire-plant (Andromeda),\r\nthe dry grass,--everything, indeed, we could think of that was within\r\nour reach,--but still no blaze, no blaze.\r\n\r\n\"With sore fingers and wearied patience, and with wits as well as bodies\r\nquite exhausted, we fell once more asleep, with mingling thoughts of\r\ntriumph and disappointment, and with prayerful hopes for what the morrow\r\nmight bring forth running through our minds.\r\n\r\n\"When the morrow came, a chance seemed to open for us; and we resolved\r\nto go about our work with caution, determined, since we had gone thus\r\nfar, that we would in the end succeed. I don't know whether it was the\r\nDean or I that first suggested it, but we made up our minds that the\r\nmoss which we had turned up with the narwhal horn, when we were\r\nbuilding at the hut, some of which had dried, would burn. We picked to\r\npieces some of the long fibres of this moss, and laid upon them,\r\nloosely, some fragments of the tinder. A spark was struck as before, and\r\nupon blowing this a bright blaze flashed up, and then died out again as\r\nquickly as it had come.\r\n\r\n\"'I have it now!' shouted the Dean, 'we're sure of it next time!' and\r\nwithout saying another word he darted off towards the beach. When he\r\ncame back again, he held in one hand a chunk of blubber from the\r\nnarwhal, out of which we squeezed some drops of oil, and soaked in them\r\nsome fibres of the moss.\r\n\r\n\"Another piece of tinder and another piece of moss were placed as they\r\nhad been before; another spark was struck, another blaze was blown, and\r\nwhen this came, the Dean was holding in it his fibres of oil-soaked\r\nmoss, and we soon had a lighted torch. 'Hurrah, hurrah!' we might well\r\nshout now, for the thing was done. 'Praised be Heaven! we have got a\r\nfire at last!'\r\n\r\n\"Then we added fresh moss to the flaming torch, which was scarcely\r\nlarger than a match, and then a few more drops of oil were added, and so\r\non, oil and moss, and moss and oil, little by little, gently, gently all\r\nthe time, until we had secured at length a good and solid flame.\r\n\r\n\"Then we laid the burning moss upon a flat stone, and then, as before,\r\nmoss and oil, and oil and moss, were added, each time in larger and\r\nlarger quantities,--no longer gently, gently, but with a careless hand,\r\nand in less, perhaps, than half an hour we had a great, smoking,\r\nfluttering blaze; and then we threw on some of the driest leaves and\r\ntwigs of the Andromeda, and some dead willow-stems and dry grass, and\r\nthen we had a roaring, sputtering, red-hot fire.\r\n\r\n\"And how we danced, and skipped, and shouted round the fire, like happy\r\nchildren round some new-found toy!\r\n\r\n\"The next thing was, of course, to turn the fire to some account. On two\r\nsides of the blaze we placed large square stones, and over these we put\r\nanother that was thin and flat; and then we skinned the duck which the\r\nDean had caught, and cut the rich flesh into little pieces and placed\r\nthem on the flat stone above the blaze; and then, to keep the smoke and\r\nashes from the cooking food, we put another light, thin stone upon the\r\nflesh, and then we watched and waited for the coming meal. To help the\r\nfire along, and make it burn more quickly, we threw into it some little\r\nchunks of blubber, and then, in a little while, the duck was cooked.\r\n\r\n\"O what a royal meal we had!--we half-famished, shipwrecked boys,--the\r\nfirst hot food we had tasted during all these long, weary, dreary days;\r\nand, not satisfied with the duck, we next broiled some eggs upon the\r\nheated stone, and ate and ate away until we were as full as we could\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\"All this had consumed many hours, and all the time we had been so much\r\nexcited that we found ourselves quite exhausted when the meal was over,\r\nand we could do no more work that day; so we lay down again upon the\r\ngrass, to talk and rest and sleep. When we came to sleep, however, we\r\nhad now another motive, besides watching for a ship, to make us sleep\r\none only at a time; for we must keep this fire going, which we had got\r\nwith so much trouble. This was easily done, since we only had to add,\r\nfrom time to time, some branches of the Andromeda, and these kept up a\r\nsmouldering fire.\r\n\r\n\"Before either of us went to sleep, we had seen that the first thing now\r\nwas to catch more ducks; and this we could either of us do, besides\r\nwatching the sea for ships, and the fire that it did not go out.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the Dean had fallen asleep, I went about this\r\nwork, fully resolved upon a plan as to how I should proceed. The\r\nknowledge of seals which I had acquired when in the _Blackbird_ had\r\nperhaps something to do with it.\r\n\r\n\"I knew, from the thickness of the seal's skin, that lines could be made\r\nout of it very well. You will remember the dead seal that I told you of\r\nthe other day, lying down on the beach, where it had been thrown up out\r\nof the sea by the waves. I forgot to mention, in addition, that we found\r\nseveral other seals, or rather, I should say, parts of them, for most of\r\nthem had been eaten up by the foxes, or had gone to pieces by decay. So\r\nI at once went down, as I was going to say, to the seal that I had first\r\ndiscovered, and, taking out my knife, I made a cut around his neck,\r\nclose behind the ears. It was a very large seal, and I found it not an\r\neasy matter to lift him up so that I could get my knife all the way\r\naround him; but I managed to do it notwithstanding, and made not only\r\none cut but a great many of them,--or rather, I should say, one\r\ncontinuous cut around and around the body of the dead animal; so you\r\nwill easily understand that, in this way, by keeping my knife about an\r\neighth of an inch from where it had gone before when it passed around,\r\nI obtained at last a long string, or rather one might say a thong, very\r\nstrong and very pliable. It must have been at least a hundred feet in\r\nlength when I stopped cutting it, and I divided it into three parts.\r\nHaving done this, I next went back to where the ducks were thickest,\r\nwhen, of course, the birds flew off their nests. Then I fixed four\r\ntraps, just as the Dean had done, tying to three of them the seal-skin\r\nstrings which I had made, and to the fourth I tied the Dean's bit of\r\ntwine; then I hid myself among the rocks, and waited for the birds to\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\n\"I had not long to wait, for in a few minutes two of them returned, and,\r\nwithout appearing to mind at all the trap that I had set for them,\r\ncrawled upon their nests so quickly that it seemed as if they were\r\nmightily afraid their eggs would get cold. Seeing a third one coming, I\r\nwaited for her too, and the fourth one came soon afterwards; and indeed,\r\nby this time, nearly all the birds that had their nests near by had come\r\nback to them. As soon as all was quiet, I pulled my strings one after\r\nanother as quickly as I could, and three of the birds were caught; but\r\nthe last one was too smart for me, as the noise made by the others had\r\nstartled her, and the heavy stone only struck her tail as she went\r\nsqualling and fluttering away, frightening off all the other ducks that\r\nwere anywhere near.\r\n\r\n\"I was not long, as you may be sure, in securing my three prizes; and I\r\ncarried them at once up to the fire near which the Dean was lying under\r\nmy overcoat in the sun. Soon after this the Dean awoke, and, when he saw\r\nwhat I had done, seemed to be much amused, as he declared that I had\r\nstolen his patent; but when he saw what kind of a line I had made, he\r\nwas filled with admiration, saying: 'Well, who would ever have thought\r\nof that? I'm sure I never should.'\r\n\r\n\"Being now very tired, I lay down while the Dean took his 'turn'; and by\r\nthe time my eyes were opened again he had caught seven birds, so that we\r\nhad now in all ten,--enough, probably, to last us as many days. This, of\r\ncourse, gave us a great deal of satisfaction, especially as we soon had\r\none of them nicely cooked, and thus got a good breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"We had now been, you see, several days on the island, and we felt that\r\nwe had done pretty well already towards providing for ourselves. The\r\nDean, as I ought to have mentioned before, had grown in strength very\r\nrapidly during the last forty-eight hours; and except that his head was\r\nstill sore from the cut and bruise, he was entirely well.\r\n\r\n\"We felt now that, whatever else might happen to us, we could not want\r\nfor food, as, besides the eggs, we could have as many ducks as we\r\npleased to catch. We had succeeded in making a fire, and had abundant\r\nmeans to keep it burning. There were only two things that seriously\r\ntroubled us. One was our lack of shelter, if a storm should come; and\r\nthe other, our lack of proper clothing, if the weather should grow cold.\r\nBut, having succeeded so well thus far, we were very hopeful for the\r\nfuture. Heaven had kindly favored us. The temperature had been very mild\r\nall the time. There had been no wind, and scarcely a cloud to obscure\r\nthe sky. As for shelter, we felt that we could manage in two days to\r\nenclose the cave; and as to the other trouble, although we were not very\r\nclear in our minds about it, yet we did not lose confidence that a ship\r\nwould come along and take us off before winter should set in. So we\r\nresolved not to abandon our vigilance, but to keep up a constant watch,\r\nas we had done before. Now that we had made a fire, we knew the smoke\r\nwould be a great help to us in drawing the attention of the people on\r\nboard any ship that might come near.\r\n\r\n\"With these agreeable reflections we went to work much more cheerfully\r\nthan we had done before.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe captain here \"hove to,\" as he said, observing, that, the day being\r\nfar spent, he would drop the story for the present. \"To-morrow, when you\r\ncome, I will tell you how we fixed up the cave, and made ourselves more\r\ncomfortable in many ways. Meanwhile you can reflect upon what I have\r\ntold you, and you can answer me then whether you think John Hardy and\r\nRichard Dean were an enviable pair of boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can answer that now,\" said William.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is the answer?\" asked the Captain, in great good-humor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, their pluck and courage everybody would envy, or at least they\r\nought to; but, for the rest, I would rather stay at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the Captain, smiling pleasantly, \"each to his taste.\r\nI rather think I should prefer being in the 'Mariner's Rest'\r\nmyself\";--saying which he led the way into the grounds in front of the\r\ncottage which he loved so well, where he took leave of his little\r\nfriends once more, making them promise over and over again (for which\r\nthere was no need at all) that they would come next day and hear about\r\nthe cave, and how they there built themselves a shelter from the Arctic\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nIn which the little People are convinced of the Goodness\r\nof Providence, as the Reader ought to be,--seeing that\r\nto be cast away is not to be forsaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have now for some time followed the old man through the recital of\r\nthe wonderful adventures which befell himself and the Dean on the lonely\r\nlittle island in the Arctic Sea; and we have watched the children going\r\nand coming from day to day. And we have seen, too, how happy the\r\nchildren were when listening to the story, and how delighted they were\r\nwith every little scrap they got of it, and how they remembered every\r\nword of it, and how William wrote it down in black and white, and had it\r\nsafe and sound for future use,--little dreaming, at the time of doing\r\nit, that the record he was keeping would find its way at last into a\r\nbook, and thus give other children than himself and Fred and Alice a\r\nchance to make the acquaintance of the good old Captain and the brave\r\nand handsome little Dean.\r\n\r\nAnd William Earnest kept his record regularly, and he kept it well, as\r\nwe have seen before; and up to this point of time everything was set\r\ndown with day and date. But now a change had clearly come over the\r\nhabits of our little party. At first, as has been hitherto related, the\r\nold Captain was a little shy of the children, though he so much liked\r\nthem; but now all formality was gone between them, and so down the\r\nchildren came to the Captain's cottage whenever they had a mind. The\r\nCaptain was always glad to see them, be it morning, noon, or evening;\r\nand never were the children, in all their lives before, so happy as when\r\nromping through the Captain's grounds, or cooling themselves upon the\r\ngrass beneath the Captain's trees, or looking at the Captain's \"traps\"\r\nor joking with that oddest boy that was ever seen, Main Brace, or\r\nplaying with the Captain's dogs,--the biggest dogs that ever bore the\r\nodd names of Port and Starboard.\r\n\r\nThe Captain now said, \"Make yourselves at home, my dears,--quite at\r\nhome\"; and the children did it; and the Captain always went about\r\nwhatever he had to do until he was ready once more to begin his\r\nstory-telling; and then they would all rush off to the yacht, or to the\r\n\"Crow's Nest,\" or the \"cabin,\" or the \"quarter-deck,\" or some other\r\npleasant place; and as the Captain related something more and more\r\nextraordinary, as it seemed to them, each time,\r\n\r\n\"the wonder grew\r\nThat one small head should carry all he knew\";\r\n\r\nwhile, as for the old man himself, he might well exclaim, with the lover\r\nin the play, \"I were but little happy if I could say how much.\"\r\n\r\nThus it came about, as we have good reason to suppose, that days and\r\ndates were lost in William's journal; and thus it was that the young\r\nand truthful chronicler of this veritable history simply wrote down,\r\nfrom time to time, what the Captain said, without mentioning much about\r\nwhen it was that the Captain said it. Sometimes he wrote with lead\r\npencil, sometimes with pen and ink, and often, as is plain to see from\r\nthe manuscript itself, at considerable intervals of time; but always, as\r\nthere is no doubt, with accuracy; for William's mind, touching the\r\nCaptain's adventures, was like the susceptible heart of the Count in the\r\nVenetian story, \"wax to receive and marble to retain.\"\r\n\r\nSo now, after this long explanation, the reader will perceive that we\r\ncan do nothing else than report the Captain's story, without always\r\nsaying where the little party were seated at the time the Captain told\r\nit. And, in truth, it matters little; at least so William thought, for\r\nhe wrote one day upon the page,--\r\n\r\n\"Where's the use, I'd like to know, putting in what Fred and me and\r\nAlice did, and where we went with the 'ancient mariner'; I haven't time\r\nto write so much, and I'll only write what the Captain said\"; and so\r\nright away he set down what follows.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Now you see,\" resumed the Captain, \"when we had done all I told you of\r\nbefore,--having slept, you know, and got well rested,--we went about our\r\nwork very hopefully. But as we were going along, meditating on our\r\nplans, the Dean stopped suddenly, and said he to me: 'Hardy, do you know\r\nwhat day it is?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said I, 'upon my word I don't, and never once thought about it!'\r\n\r\n\"The Dean looked very sad all at once, and, not being able to see why\r\nthat should be, I asked what difference it made to us what day it was.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, a great deal of difference,' said the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"'How?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' said the Dean, 'when shall we know when Sunday comes?'\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, how should we know when Sunday came! I had not thought of\r\nthat before; but the Dean was differently brought up from me; for, while\r\nI had not been taught to care much about such matters, the Dean had, and\r\nhe looked upon Sunday as a day when nobody should do any sort of work. I\r\nbelieve the Dean had an idea in his head, that, if it was Sunday, and he\r\nwas frozen half to death already, or starved about as badly, and should\r\nrefuse to work to save himself from death outright, he would do a\r\nvirtuous thing in sacrificing himself, and would go straight up to\r\nheaven for certain. So I became anxious too, and for the Dean's sake, if\r\nnot for my own, I tried hard to recall what day it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very queer,\" said William, \"to forget what day it was! How did it\r\nhappen? Won't you tell us that, Captain Hardy?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the obliging Captain,--\"as well as I can, that is.\r\nNow, do you remember what I told you the other day about the sun shining\r\nall the time,--do you remember that, my lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered William, \"of course I do. Goes round and round, that\r\nway,\" and he whirled his hat about his head.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" went on the Captain,--\"just so, exactly. Goes round and\r\nround, and never sets until the winter comes, and then it goes down, and\r\nthere it stays all the winter through, and there is constant darkness\r\nwhere the daylight always was before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, all the time?\" asked William.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Captain; \"dark all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dark?\" asked Fred.\r\n\r\n\"Dark as dark can be. Dark at morning and at evening. Dark at noon, and\r\ndark at midnight. Dark all the time, as I have said. Dark all the winter\r\nthrough. Dark for months and months.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Fred.\r\n\r\n\"Dreadful enough, as I can assure you, with no light, all the whole\r\nwinter-time, except the moon and stars. A dreadful thing to live along\r\nfor days and days, and weeks and weeks, and months and months, without\r\nthe blessed light of day,--without once seeing the sun come up and\r\nbrighten everything and make us glad, and the pretty flowers to unfold\r\nthemselves, and all the living world praise the Lord for remembering it.\r\nThat's what you never see in all the Arctic winter,--no sunshine ever\r\nstreaming up above the hills and making all the rainbow colors in the\r\nclouds. That's what you never see at all, no more than if you were blind\r\nand couldn't see.\r\n\r\n\"But never mind just now about the winter. We haven't done with the\r\nsummer yet, nor with Sunday either, for that matter.\r\n\r\n\"As I have said before, the loss of Sunday much grieved the Dean. So,\r\nyou see, we had nothing else to do but make one on our own account.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, make a Sunday!\" exclaimed William. \"I've heard of people making\r\nalmost everything, even building castles in the air; but I never heard\r\nbefore of anybody putting up a Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, we did the best we could. It is not at all surprising\r\nthat we should have lost our reckoning in this way, seeing that the sun\r\nwas shining, as I have told you, all the time; and we worked and slept\r\nwithout much regard to whether the hours of night or day were on us. So\r\nwe had good reason for a little mixing up of dates. In fact we could\r\nneither of us very well recall the day of the month that we were cast\r\naway. It was somewhere near the end of June, that we knew; but the exact\r\nday we could not tell for certain. We remembered the day of the week\r\nwell enough, and it was Tuesday; but more than this we could not get\r\ninto our heads; and so it seemed that there was nothing for us but to\r\nsink all days into the one long day of the Arctic summer, and nevermore\r\nknow whether it was Sunday, or Monday, or Friday, or what day it was of\r\nany month; and if it should be Heaven's will that we should live on upon\r\nthe island until the New Year came round, and still other years should\r\ncome and go, we should never know New Year's day.\r\n\r\n\"But, as I was saying, about making a Sunday for ourselves. I did\r\neverything I could to refresh my memory about it. I counted up the\r\nnumber of times we had slept, and the number of times we had worked, and\r\nrecalled the day when I first walked around the island; and I tried my\r\nbest to connect all those events together in such a way as to prove how\r\noften the sun had passed behind the cliffs, and how often it had shone\r\nupon us; and thus I made out that the very day I am telling you about\r\nproved to be Sunday,--at least I so convinced the Dean, and he was\r\nsatisfied. And that's the way we made a Sunday for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"So we resolved to do no work that day; and this was well, for we were\r\nvery weary and needed rest.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you that we passed the time in talking over our plans\r\nfor the future, and in discussing the prospects ahead of us, and\r\narranging what we should do. You see we had settled about Sunday, so\r\nthat was off our minds; and after recalling many things which had\r\nhappened to us, and things which had been done on the _Blackbird_, we\r\nfinally concluded that we had found out the day of the month, and so we\r\ncalled the day 'Sunday, the second of July,' and this we marked, as I\r\nwill show you, thus: On the top of a large flat rock near by I placed a\r\nsmall white stone, and this we called our 'Sunday stone'; and then, in a\r\nrow with this stone, we placed six other stones, which we called by the\r\nother days of the week. Then I moved the white stone out of line a\r\nlittle, which was to show that Sunday had passed, and afterwards, when\r\nthe next day had gone, we did the same with the Monday stone, and so on\r\nuntil the stones were all on a line again, when we knew that it was once\r\nmore Sunday. Of course we knew when the day was gone, by the sun being\r\naround on the north side of the island, throwing the shadow of the\r\ncliffs upon us.\r\n\r\n\"For noting the days of the month we made a similar arrangement to that\r\nwhich we had made for the days of the week; and thus you see we had now\r\ngot an almanac among other things.\r\n\r\n\"'And now,' said the Dean, 'let us put all this down for fear we forget\r\nit.' So away the little fellow ran and gathered a great quantity of\r\nsmall pebbles, and these we arranged on the top of the rock so as to\r\nform letters; and the letters that we thus made spelled out\r\n\r\n                  'JOHN HARDY AND RICHARD DEAN,\r\n                     CAST AWAY IN THE COLD,\r\n                    TUESDAY, JUNE 27, 1824.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, when we came to look ahead, and to speculate upon what was likely\r\nto befall us, we saw that we had two months of summer still remaining;\r\nand, as midsummer had hardly come yet, we knew that we were likely to\r\nhave it warmer than before, and we had now no further fears about being\r\nable to live through that period. In these two months it was plain that\r\none of two things must happen,--a ship must come along and take us off,\r\nor we must be prepared for the dark time that must follow after the sun\r\nshould go down for the winter; otherwise a third thing would certainly\r\nhappen, that is, we should both die,--an event which did not, in any\r\ncase, seem at all unlikely; so we pledged ourselves to stand by each\r\nother through every fortune, each helping the other all he could. At any\r\nrate, we would not lose hope, and never despair of being saved, through\r\nthe mercy of Providence, somehow or other.\r\n\r\n\"Having reached this resigned state of mind, we were ready to consider\r\nrationally what we had to do. It was clear enough that, if we only\r\nlooked out for a ship to save us, and that chance should in the end\r\nfail, we would be ill prepared for the winter if we were left on the\r\nisland to encounter its perils. Therefore it was necessary to be ready\r\nfor the worst, and accordingly, after a little deliberation, we\r\nconcluded to proceed as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. We would construct a place to shelter ourselves from the cold and\r\nstorms. (In this we had made some satisfactory progress already.)\r\n\r\n\"2d. We would collect all the food we could while there was opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"3d. We would gather fuel, of which, as had been already proved, there\r\nwas Andromeda (or fire-plant) and moss and blubber to depend upon. Of\r\nthis latter the dead narwhal and seal would furnish us a moderate\r\nsupply; but for the rest we must rely upon our own skill to capture some\r\nother animals from the sea; though, as to how this was to be done, we\r\nhad to own ourselves completely at fault.\r\n\r\n\"4th. We would in some manner secure for ourselves warmer clothing,\r\notherwise we would certainly freeze; and here we were completely at\r\nfault too.\r\n\r\n\"5th. We would contrive in some way to make for ourselves a lamp, as we\r\ncould never live in our cave in darkness; and here was a difficulty\r\napparently even more insurmountable than the others,--as much so as\r\nappeared the making of a fire in the first instance,--for while we had a\r\ngeneral idea that we might capture some seals, and get thus a good\r\nsupply of oil, and that we might also get plenty of fox-skins for\r\nclothing, yet neither of us could think of any way to make a lamp.\r\n\r\n\"When we came thus to bring ourselves to view the situation, the\r\nprospect might have caused stouter hearts than ours to fear; but, as we\r\nhad seen before, nothing was to be gained by lamentation, so we put a\r\nbold front on, firmly resolved to make the best fight we could.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A poor chance for you, I should think,\" said Fred, \"and I don't see how\r\nyou ever lived through so many troubles,\"--while little Alice declared\r\nher opinion that \"the poor Dean must have died anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very bad prospect, indeed, my dears,\" continued the Captain,--\"very\r\nbad, I can assure you; but as it is a poor rule to read the last page of\r\na book before you read the rest of it, so we will go right on to the end\r\nwith our story, and then you will find out what became of the Dean, as\r\nwell as what happened to myself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I was going to say, when Monday came, we set about our work,\r\nnot exactly in the order which I have named, but as we found most\r\nconvenient; and as day after day followed each other through the week,\r\nand as one week followed after another week, we found ourselves at one\r\ntime building up the wall in front of the cave, then catching ducks and\r\ngathering eggs, then collecting the fire-plant, and then throwing moss\r\nup on the rocks to dry, and then cutting off the blubber and skins of\r\nthe dead seal and narwhal.\r\n\r\n\"All of these things were carefully secured; and in a sort of cave, much\r\nlike the one we were preparing for our abode, only larger, we stowed\r\naway all the fire-plant and dried moss that we could get. Then we looked\r\nabout us to see what we should do for a place to put our blubber\r\nin,--that is, you know, the fat we got off the dead narwhal and the\r\nseal, and also any other blubber that we might get afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"When we had cut all the blubber off the seal and narwhal, we found that\r\nwe had an enormous heap of it,--as much, at least, in quantity, as five\r\ngood barrels full,--and, since the sun was very warm, there was great\r\ndanger, not only that it would spoil, but that much of it would melt and\r\nrun away. Fortunately, very near our hut there was a small glacier\r\nhanging on the hillside, coming down a narrow valley from a greater mass\r\nof ice which lay above. From the face of this glacier a great many lumps\r\nof ice had broken off, and there were also deep banks of snow which the\r\nsummer's sun had not melted.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of this accumulation of ice and snow we had little\r\ndifficulty in making, partly by excavating and partly by building up, a\r\nsort of cave, large enough to hold twice as much blubber as we had to\r\nput into it. Here we deposited our treasure, which was our only reliance\r\nfor light in case we invented a lamp, and our chief reliance for fire\r\nif the winter should come and find us still upon the island.\r\n\r\n\"After we had thus secured, in this snow-and-ice cave, our stock of\r\nblubber, we constructed another much like it near by for our food, and\r\ninto this we had soon gathered a pretty large stock of ducks and eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Hardy and the Dean provide for the Future.]\r\n\r\n\"When we contemplated all that we had done in this particular, you may\r\nbe sure our spirits rose very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Odd, wasn't it?\" said Fred, \"having a storehouse made of ice and snow.\r\nBut, Captain Hardy, if you'll excuse me for interrupting you, what did\r\nthis glacier that you spoke about look like? and what was it anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"A glacier is nothing more,\" replied the Captain, \"than a stream of ice\r\nmade out of snow partly melted and then frozen again, and which,\r\nforming, as I have said before, high up on the tops of the hills, runs\r\ndown a valley and breaks off at its end and melts away. Sometimes it is\r\nvery large,--miles across,--and goes all the way down to the sea; and\r\nthe pieces that break off from it are of immense size, and are called\r\n_icebergs_. Sometimes the glaciers are very small, especially on small\r\nislands such as ours was. This little glacier I tell you of lay in a\r\nnarrow valley, as I said before; and, as the cliffs were very high on\r\neither side, it was almost always in shadow, and the air was very cold\r\nthere; so you see how fortunate it was that we thought of fixing upon\r\nthat place for our storehouses. Then another great advantage to us was,\r\nthat it was so near our hut,--being within sight, and only a few steps\r\nacross some rough rocks; but among these rocks we contrived, in course\r\nof time, to make, by filling in with small stones, a pretty smooth walk.\r\n\r\n\"As we caught and put away the ducks in our storehouse, we began at\r\nlength to preserve their skins. At first we could see no value in them,\r\nand threw them away; but we imagined at length that, in case we could\r\nnot catch the foxes, they would serve to make us some sort of clothing,\r\nwhile out of the seal-skin which I mentioned before we could make boots,\r\nif we only had anything to sew with.\r\n\r\n\"Thus one difficulty after another continued to beset us; but this last\r\none was soon partly overcome, for the Dean, on the very first day of\r\nour landing, discovered that he had in his pocket his palm and needle,\r\ncarrying it always about him when on shipboard, like any other good\r\nsailor; but we lacked thread.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a palm and needle, Captain Hardy?\" inquired William.\r\n\r\n\"A palm,\" answered the Captain, \"is a band of leather going around the\r\nhand, with a thimble fitted into it where it comes across the root of\r\nthe thumb. The sailor's needle differs only from the common one in being\r\nlonger and three-cornered, instead of round. It is used for sewing sails\r\nand other coarse work on shipboard. The needle is held between the thumb\r\nand forefinger, and is pushed through with the thimble in the palm of\r\nthe hand, and hence the name.\r\n\r\n\"To come back to our story (having, as I hope, made the palm and needle\r\nquestion clear to you), let me ask you to remember that I told you, when\r\nI landed on the island, I had four things,--that is:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. My life;\r\n\r\n\"2d. The clothes on my back;\r\n\r\n\"3d. A jack-knife; and\r\n\r\n\"4th. The mercy of Providence.\r\n\r\n\"But now, you see, I had added a fifth article to that list, in the\r\nDean's needle; and I might also say that I had a sixth one, too, in the\r\nDean himself, which I did not dare enumerate in the list at first, as I\r\nfelt pretty sure that the Dean was going to die, or at least wake up\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\n\"But you see a sailor's palm and needle could be of very little use\r\nunless we had some thread, of which we did not possess a single\r\nparticle, except the small piece that was in the needle, and by which it\r\nwas tied to the palm. It was a good while before we obtained anything\r\nto make thread of, so we will pass that subject by for the present, and\r\ncome back to what we had more immediately in hand. This was the\r\npreparation of our cave, or rather, as we had better say, hut,--that\r\nbeing more nearly what it was.\r\n\r\n\"The building of our hut, then, was indeed a very difficult task, as the\r\nsolid wall we had to construct in front was much higher than our heads,\r\nand in this wall we had, of course, to leave a doorway and a window,\r\nbesides a sort of chimney, or outlet, for the smoke from the fireplace,\r\nwhich was beside the door.\r\n\r\n\"We must have been at least two weeks making this wall, for we had not\r\nonly to construct the wall itself, but when it got so high that we could\r\nno longer reach up to the top, we had to build steps, that we might\r\nclimb there. We left a window above the doorway, not thinking, of\r\ncourse, to find any glass to put in it, but leaving it rather as a\r\nventilator than a window. It was very small, not more than a foot\r\nsquare, and was easily shut up at any time, if we should not need it.\r\nFor a door, we used a piece of the narwhal skin. This skin was fastened\r\nabove the doorway with pegs, which we made of bones, driving them into\r\nthe cracks between the stones, thus letting the skin fall down over the\r\ndoorway like a curtain.\r\n\r\n\"In making the wall, we were greatly helped by the bones which I had\r\nfound down on the beach, as they were much lighter than the stones, and\r\naided in holding the moss in its place, so that we were able to use much\r\nmore of that material than we otherwise should have been. When the wall\r\nwas completed, we were gratified to see how tight it was, and how\r\nperfectly we had made it fit the rocks by means of the moss.\r\n\r\n\"Having completed the wall, our next concern was to arrange the\r\ninterior; but about this we had no need to be in so great a hurry as\r\nwith the wall, for we had now a place to shelter us from any storm that\r\nmight come, and we could hope to make ourselves somewhat comfortable\r\nthere, even although the inside was not well fitted up; for we had a\r\nfireplace, and could do our cooking without going outside. When we found\r\nhow perfect was the draft through the outlet, or chimney, you may be\r\nvery sure we were greatly delighted.\r\n\r\n\"As it fell out, we had secured this shelter in the very nick of time,\r\nfor in two days afterwards a violent storm arose,--a heavy wind with\r\nhail and gusts of snow,--a strange kind of weather, you will think, for\r\nthe middle of July. This storm made havoc with the ice on the east side\r\nof the island, breaking it up, and driving it out over the sea to the\r\nwestward, filling the sea up so much in that direction, that there was\r\nno use, for the present at least, in looking for ships, as none could\r\ncome near us. The storm made a very wild and fearful spectacle of the\r\nsea, as the waves went dashing over the pieces of ice and against the\r\nicebergs. When I looked out upon this scene, and listened to the noises\r\nmade by the waves and the crushing ice, and heard the roaring wind, I\r\nwondered more than ever what could possess anybody to go to such a sea\r\nin a ship, for it seemed to me that the largest possible gains would not\r\nbe a sufficient reward for the dangers to be encountered.\r\n\r\n\"But so it always was, and always will be, I suppose. Whenever there is\r\na little money to be made, men will encounter any kind of hazard in\r\norder to get it. Thus the risks in going after whales and seals for\r\ntheir blubber, which is very valuable, are great; but then, if the ship\r\nmakes a good voyage, the profits are very large, and when the sailors\r\nreceive their 'lay,' that is, their share of the profits on the oil and\r\nwhalebone which have been taken, it sometimes amounts to quite a\r\nhandsome sum of money to each, and they consider themselves well\r\nrewarded for all their privations and hardships. And it must be owned\r\nthat the whalers and sealers are a very brave sort of men, especially\r\nthe whalers who go among the ice; for besides the dangers to the vessel,\r\nand the danger always encountered in approaching a whale to harpoon him\r\n(for, as you must know, he sometimes knocks the boat to pieces with his\r\nmonstrous tail, and spills all the crew out in the water), he may, while\r\nswimming off with the harpoon in him, and dragging the boat by the line\r\nwhich is fast to it, take it into his head to rush beneath the ice, and\r\nthus destroy the boat and drown the people.\r\n\r\n\"But this is too long a falling to 'leeward' of our story, as the\r\nsailors would call it; so we will come right back into the wind again.\r\n\r\n\"When the weather cleared off after the storm, we went to work as\r\nbefore. But everything about looked gloomy enough. The cliffs were\r\nbesprinkled with snow, and about the rocks the snow had drifted, and it\r\nlay in streaks where it had been carried by the wind. The sea was still\r\nvery rough, and, as there were many immense pieces of ice upon the\r\nwater, when the waves rose and fell, the pounding of it on the rocks\r\nmade a most fearful sound.\r\n\r\n\"The sun coming out warm, however, soon melted the snow, and, getting\r\nheated up with work, we got on bravely. Indeed, we soon became not less\r\nsurprised at the rapid progress we were making than at the facility with\r\nwhich we accommodated ourselves to our strange condition of life, and\r\neven grew cheerful under what would seem a state of the greatest\r\npossible distress. Thus you observe how perfectly we may reconcile\r\nourselves to any fate, if we have but a resolute will, and the fear of\r\nGod in our hearts. I do not mean to boast about the Dean and myself: but\r\nI think it must be owned that we kept up our courage pretty well, all\r\nthings considered,--now, don't _you_ think so, my dears?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure we do,\" replied William. \"And if anybody dares to doubt it,\r\nI will go, like Count Robert, to the crossroad, and give battle for a\r\nweek to all comers, just as he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poking fun at the ancient mariner again,--are you?\" said the Captain,\r\ntrying hard to look serious. \"And so I'll punish you, my boy, by\r\nknocking off just where we are, and saying not another word this blessed\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nRelates how a Desert Island became a Rock of Good Hope,\r\nand other Hopeful Matters which to be understood\r\nmust be read of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You now see,\" went on the Captain, when the story was again resumed,\r\n\"that the Dean and myself had by this time fallen into a regular course\r\nof life. 'What cannot be helped,' said the Dean, 'we must make the best\r\nof.'\r\n\r\n\"Being thus obliged to make the best of it, we became resigned; and here\r\nlet me say that even now I feel much surprised at the ease with which we\r\ndropped into ways suitable to our new life. You have seen already how\r\none difficulty after another vanished before our patient efforts; and\r\nnow that we had a fire to warm us, and a hut to shelter us, we felt as\r\nif we could overcome almost anything. So we gained great courage, and\r\nwere fast settling down to business, like any other people, feeling that\r\nour lives were at least in no present danger.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean and I had a conversation about this time, which I will try to\r\nrepeat as nearly as I can. We were seated on the hillside overlooking\r\nthe sea to the west, attracted by what we at first took for a ship under\r\nfull sail, steering right in towards the island; but you can imagine how\r\ngreat was our disappointment when we found that what we had taken for a\r\nship was nothing more than an iceberg looming up above the sea in a\r\nmisty atmosphere. This was the third time we had been deceived in that\r\nmanner. Once the Dean had come rushing towards me, shouting at the top\r\nof his voice, 'The fleet! the fleet!' meaning the whale-ships; but he\r\nmight just as well have saved himself all that trouble, for 'the fleet'\r\nproved to be only a great group of icebergs; but when I told him so he\r\nwould hardly believe it, until he became at last convinced that they\r\nwere not moving.\r\n\r\n\"You must know that these icebergs assume all sorts of shapes, and it\r\nwas very natural, since we were always on the lookout for ships, that\r\nour imaginations should be excited and disturbed, and ready to see at\r\nany time what we most wanted to see; nor were we at all peculiar in\r\nthis, as many people might tell you who were never cast away in the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"So it is not surprising that we should cry out very frequently 'A sail,\r\na sail!' when there was not a sail perhaps within many hundred miles of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I was going to say, the Dean and I sat upon the hillside\r\noverlooking the sea, thinking the icebergs were ships, or hoping so at\r\nleast, until hope died away, and then it was that we fell to talking.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think, Hardy,' asked the Dean, 'that any other ship than ours\r\never did come this way or ever will?'\r\n\r\n\"'I'm afraid not,' said I; and I must have looked very despondent about\r\nit, as in truth I was,--much more so than I would have liked to own.\r\n\r\n\"I had not considered what the Dean was about, for he was despondent\r\nenough himself, and no doubt wished very hard that I might say something\r\nto cheer him up a bit; but, instead of doing that, I only made him\r\nworse, whereupon he seemed to grow angry, and in a rather snappish way\r\nhe inquired of me if I knew what I was.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said I, quite taken aback. 'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n\"'Mean!' exclaimed the Dean. 'Why, I mean to say,'--and he spoke in a\r\npositive way that was not usual with him,--'I mean to say,' said he,\r\n'that you are a regular Job's comforter, and no mistake.'\r\n\r\n\"I had not the least idea at that period of my life as to what kind of a\r\nthing a Job's comforter was. I had a vague notion that it was something\r\nto go round the neck, and I protested that I was nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, you are, and you know you are,' went on the Dean,--'a regular\r\nJob's comforter,--croaking all the time, and never seeing any way out of\r\nour troubles at all.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should like to know,' said I,--and I thought I had him there,--'how\r\nI can see any way out of our troubles when there isn't any!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, you can think there is, if there isn't,--can't you?' and the\r\nDean was ten times more snappish than he was before; and, having thus\r\ndelivered himself, he snapped himself up and snapped himself off in a\r\ngreat hurry; but, as the little fellow turned to go away, I thought I\r\nsaw great big tears stealing down his cheeks. I thought that his voice\r\ntrembled over the last words; and when he went behind a rock and hid\r\nhimself, I knew that he had gone away to cry, and that he had been\r\nashamed to cry where I could see him.\r\n\r\n\"After a while I went to him. He was lying on his side, with his head\r\nupon his arm. His cap had fallen off, and the light wind was playing\r\ngently with his curly hair. The sun was shining brightly in his face,\r\nand, sunburnt and weather-beaten though it was, his rosy cheeks were the\r\nsame as ever. But bitter, scalding tears had left their traces there,\r\nfor the poor boy had cried himself to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"His sleep was troubled, for he was calling out, and his hands and feet\r\nwere twitching now and then, and cruel dreams were weighing on his\r\nsleeping, even more heavily, perhaps, than they had been upon his waking\r\nthoughts. So I awoke him. He sprang up instantly, looking very wild, and\r\nsat upon the rock. 'Where am I? What's the matter? Is that you, Hardy?'\r\nwere the questions with which he greeted me so quickly that I could not\r\nanswer one of them. Then he smiled in his natural way, and said, 'After\r\nall, it was only a dream.'\r\n\r\n\"'What was it?' I asked. 'Tell me, Dean, what it was.'\r\n\r\n\"'O, it was not much, but you see it put me in a dreadful fright. I\r\nthought a ship was steering close in by the land; I thought I saw you\r\nspring upon the deck and sail away; and as you sailed away upon the\r\nsilvery sea, I thought you turned and mocked me, and I cursed you as I\r\nstood upon the beach, until some foul fiend, in punishment for my wicked\r\nwords, caught me by the neck, and dragged me through the sea, and tied\r\nme fast to the vessel's keel, and there I was with his last words\r\nringing in my ears, with the gurgling waters, \"Follow him to your doom,\"\r\nwhen you awoke me. \"Follow him to your doom!\" I seem to hear the demon\r\nshrieking even now, though I'm wide enough awake.'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't wonder at your fright, and I'm glad I woke you!' said I, not\r\nknowing what else to say.\r\n\r\n\"'It all comes,' went on the little fellow, 'of my being angry with you,\r\nHardy'; and so he asked me to forgive him, and not think badly of him,\r\nand said he would not be so ungrateful any more, and many such things,\r\nwhich it pained me very much to have him say; and so I made him stop,\r\nand then somehow or other we got our arms around each other's neck, and\r\nwe kissed each other's cheeks, and great cataracts of tears came tearing\r\nfrom each other's eyes; and the first and last unkindness that had come\r\nbetween us was passed and gone forever.\r\n\r\n\"'But do you really think,' said the Dean, when he got his voice\r\nagain,--'do you really think that, if a ship don't come along and take\r\nus off, we can live here on this wretched little island,--that is, when\r\nthe summer goes, and all the birds have flown away, and the darkness and\r\nthe cold are on us all the time?'\"\r\n\r\n\"'To be sure we can,' I answered; but, to tell the truth, I had very\r\ngreat doubts about it, only I thought that this would strengthen up the\r\nDean; and as I had, by this time, made for myself a better definition to\r\nJob's comforter than a something to go around the neck, I had no idea of\r\nbeing called by that name any more.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm glad to hear you say that!' exclaimed the Dean. 'Indeed I am!'\r\n\r\n\"There was no need to give me such very strong assurance that he was\r\n'glad to hear it,' for his face showed as plain as could be that he was\r\nglad to hear me say anything that had the least hope in it.\r\n\r\n\"After this the Dean grew quite cheerful. Suddenly he asked, 'Do you\r\nknow, Hardy, if this island has a name?'\r\n\r\n\"Of course I did not know, and told him so.\r\n\r\n\"'Then I'll give it one right off,' said he; 'I'll call it from this\r\nminute the Rock of Good Hope, and here we'll make our start in life.\r\nIt's as good a place, perhaps, to make a start in life as any other; for\r\nnobody is likely to dispute our title to our lands, or molest us in our\r\nfortune-making, which is more than could be said if our lot were cast in\r\nany other place.'\r\n\r\n\"This vein of conversation brightened me up a little. Indeed, it was\r\nhard to be very long despondent in the presence of the Dean's hopeful\r\ndisposition. There was much more said of the same nature, which it is\r\nnot necessary to repeat. It is enough for me to tell you that the upshot\r\nof the whole matter was that we came in the end to regard ourselves as\r\nsettled on the island, if not for the remainder of our lives, at least\r\nfor an indefinite time, and we made up our minds that there was no use\r\nin being gloomy and cast down about it. So from that time forward we\r\nwere mostly cheerful, and, though you may think it very strange, were\r\ngenerally contented.\r\n\r\n\"This was a great step gained, and when we now came to make an inventory\r\nof our possessions, we did it just as a farmer or merchant would do.\r\nBeing the undisputed owners of this Rock of Good Hope, we considered\r\nourselves none the less owners of all the foxes, ducks, eggs,\r\neider-down, dead beasts, dry bones, and whatsoever else there might be\r\nupon it; and, besides this, we had a lien upon all the seals and\r\nwalruses and whales of every kind that lived in the sea,--that is, if we\r\ncould catch them.\r\n\r\n\"We now worked with even a better spirit than we had done before, for\r\nthe idea of being settled on the island for life seemed to imply that we\r\nhad need to look ahead farther than when our hopes of rescue had been\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\"And first we finished the hut in which we were to live,--doing it not\r\nas if we were putting up a tent for temporary use, but as a man who has\r\njust come into possession of a large property puts up a fine house on\r\nit, that he may be comfortable for the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you our hut was about twelve feet square, and that we had,\r\nafter much hard labor, succeeded in closing it up perfectly, and in\r\nmaking it tight. Along the peak of it, where the two rocks came\r\ntogether, there was a crack which gave us much trouble; but at length\r\nwe succeeded in pounding down into it, with the but-end of our narwhal\r\nhorn, a great quantity of moss or turf, and thus closed it tight.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you here, while we are on the subject of moss, and since I\r\nhave spoken about it so often, that the moss grew on our island, as it\r\ndoes in all Arctic countries, with a richness that you never see\r\nhere,--moss being, in truth, the characteristic vegetation of the Arctic\r\nregions. In the valley fronting us there was a bed of it several feet\r\nthick. Its fibres were very long,--as much, in some places, as four\r\ninches,--all of a single year's growth; and as it had gone on growing\r\nyear after year, you will understand that there was layer after layer of\r\nit. In one place, at the side of the valley to the right as we went down\r\ntowards the beach, it seemed to have died out after growing for many\r\nyears; and when we discovered this, we were more rejoiced than we had\r\nbeen at any time since starting the fire; for the moss, being dead, had\r\nbecome dry and hard, and burned almost like peat, as we found when we\r\ncame to try it in our fireplace; and when we added to it a little of our\r\nblubber, it made such a heat that we could not have desired anything\r\nbetter. Indeed, it made our hut so warm that we could leave the door and\r\nwindow both open until the weather became colder.\r\n\r\n\"One thing which gave us great satisfaction was the immense quantity of\r\nthe dead moss which was in this bed,--so much, indeed, that, no matter\r\nhow long we should live there, we could never burn up the hundredth part\r\nof it. At first there had not appeared to be much of it, but it\r\ndeveloped more and more, like a coal mine, as we dug farther and farther\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\"Our fireplace was therefore, as you see, a great success; but we were,\r\nafter a few days, most unexpectedly troubled with it. Thus far the wind\r\nhad been blowing only in one direction; but afterwards it shifted to the\r\nopposite quarter, driving the smoke all down into the hut, and\r\nsmothering us out. Neither of us being a skilful mason, we could not\r\nimagine what was the matter; but finally it occurred to us, after much\r\nuseless labor had been spent in tearing part of it down and building it\r\nup again, that it was too low, being just on a level with the top of the\r\nhut; so we ran it up as much higher as we could lift the stones, which\r\nwas about four feet, and after that we had no more trouble with it.\r\n\r\n\"Having succeeded so well with our arrangements towards keeping up a\r\nfire, we next fitted up a bed, as the storms now began to trouble us,\r\nand we found, when we were driven away from the grass, and were obliged\r\nto sleep inside of the hut, that it was a very hard place to sleep,\r\nbeing nothing but rough stones, which made us very sore, and made our\r\nbones ache.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing we did now was to build a wall about as high as our\r\nknees right across the middle of the hut, from side to side; then,\r\nacross the space thus enclosed in the back part of the hut, we built up\r\nanother wall about three feet high,--thus, you see, making two divisions\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"One of these divisions we used as a sort of store-room or closet,\r\nlevelling the bottom of it with flat stone, of which we had no\r\ndifficulty in getting all we wanted. We also covered the front part of\r\nthe hut with stones of the same description, thus making quite a smooth\r\nfloor. It was not large enough, as you will see, to give us much trouble\r\nin keeping it clean. Of the second division, in the back part, we made\r\nour bed, by first filling it up with moss, then covering the moss over\r\nwith dry grass.\r\n\r\n\"Having given up all hope of a ship coming after us, we now gave up\r\nwatching for one; and we went to sleep together on our new bed, lying on\r\nthe dry grass, and, as before, covering ourselves over with my large\r\novercoat. We found it to be more comfortable than you would think, and\r\naltogether better than anything we had yet had to sleep on. But we came\r\nnear losing our fire by it, as the last embers were just dying out when\r\nwe awoke from this our first sleep in the hut.\r\n\r\n\"But this bed did not exactly suit our fancy, and, seeing the necessity\r\nfor some better kind of bedclothes, our wits were once more set to\r\nworking, in order to discover something with which to fasten together\r\nthe duck-skins that we had been saving and drying, and of which we had\r\nnow almost a hundred. We had spread them out upon the rocks, and dried\r\nthem in the sun; for we had seen that, if we could only find something\r\nwith which to sew them together, we might make all the clothing that we\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\"The eider-duck skin is very warm, having, besides its thick coat of\r\nfeathers, a heavy underlayer of soft warm down, which, as I told you\r\nbefore, the ducks pick off to line their nests with. The skins are also\r\nvery strong, as well as warm.\r\n\r\n\"Now, however, as at other times since we had been cast away, good\r\nfortune came to us; and we had scarcely begun seriously to feel the need\r\nof sewing materials before they were thrown in our way, as if\r\nprovidentially. It happened thus:--\r\n\r\n\"In cutting the blubber from the dead narwhal, we had quite exposed the\r\nstrong sinews of the tail, without, however, for a moment imagining that\r\nwe were preparing the way to a most important and useful discovery.\r\nAfter a while this sinew had become partially dried in the sun, and one\r\nday, while busy with some one of our now quite numerous occupations, I\r\nwas much surprised to see the Dean running towards me from the beach,\r\nand was still more surprised when I heard him crying out, 'I have it, I\r\nhave it!'\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me that the Dean was always having something, and I was\r\nmore than ever curious to know what it was this time.\r\n\r\n\"He had been down to the beach, and, observing some of the dried sinew,\r\nhad begun to tear it to pieces; and in this way he found out that he\r\ncould make threads of it, and he immediately set off to tell me about\r\nit. We at once went together down to the beach, and, cutting off all\r\nthat we could get of this strong sinew, we spread it upon the rocks,\r\nthat it might dry more thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"In a few days the sun had completely dried and hardened a great\r\nquantity of this stuff; and we found that, when we came to pick it to\r\npieces, we could make, if we chose, very fine threads of it,--as fine\r\nand as strong as ordinary silk. This was a great discovery truly, as it\r\nwas the only thing now wanting, except some cooking utensils, to\r\ncomplete our domestic furniture. As for the latter, it was some time\r\nbefore we invented anything; but thus far we had been occupied with what\r\nseemed to be more important concerns. Over on the opposite side of the\r\nisland I found some stones of very soft texture; and, upon trying them\r\nwith my knife, I discovered that they were precisely the same kind of\r\nstones that I had often found at home, and which we there called\r\nsoapstone. Upon making further search there proved to be quite an\r\nextensive vein of it; and since I knew that in civilized countries\r\ngriddles are made out of soapstone, I concluded at once that other kinds\r\nof cooking utensils might be made as well. Accordingly I carried to our\r\nhut several pieces of it, and there they lay for a good while, until I\r\ncould find leisure to carve some pots and other things out of them.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see we were getting along very well, steadily collecting those\r\nthings which were necessary as well for our comfort as our safety. If\r\nthe island on which we had been cast away was barren and inhospitable,\r\nit was none the less capable, like almost every other land, in whatever\r\nregion of the earth, of furnishing subsistence to men.\r\n\r\n\"When we saw what we could do with the sinew of the narwhal, we\r\nimmediately set about preparing some bedclothes for ourselves. This we\r\ndid by squaring off the duck-skins with my knife, and then sewing them\r\ntightly together. Thus we obtained, not only a soft bed to lie upon, but\r\na good warm quilt to cover us.\r\n\r\n\"This done, we went back to the cooking utensils, which you may be sure\r\nwe were very much in need of. Out of a good large block of soapstone, by\r\ncareful digging with the knife, we soon made quite a good-sized pot,\r\nwhich was found to answer perfectly. We could now change our diet a\r\nlittle,--at least, I should say, the manner of cooking it; for while we\r\ncould before only fry our ducks and eggs on flat stones, when we got the\r\npot we could boil them. This gave us great pleasure, as we were getting\r\nvery tired of having but one style of food; still I cannot say that\r\nthere was so very much occasion for being over-glad, as at best it was\r\nonly ducks and eggs, and eggs and ducks, like the boy you have heard of\r\nin the story, who had first mush and milk, and then, for variety, milk\r\nand mush.\r\n\r\n\"So one day the Dean said to me, 'Hardy, can't we catch some of these\r\nlittle birds,--auks you call them?' 'How?' said I. 'I don't know,' said\r\nhe; so we were just as well off as we had been before. But this set us\r\nto thinking again; and the birds being very tame, and flying low, it\r\noccurred to us that we might make a net, and fasten it to the end of our\r\nnarwhal horn, which we had thus far only used while making our hut.\r\nLuckily for us, the Dean--who, I need hardly say, was a very clever boy\r\nin every sense--had learned from one of the sailors the art of\r\nnet-making; and out of some of the narwhal sinew he contrived, in two\r\ndays, to construct quite a good-sized net. And now the difficulty was to\r\nstretch it; but by this time our inventive faculties had been pretty\r\nwell sharpened, and we were not long in finding that we could make a\r\nperfect hoop by lashing together three seal ribs which we picked up on\r\nthe beach; and, having fastened this hoop securely to the narwhal horn,\r\nwe sallied forth to the north side of the island, where the auks were\r\nmost abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Changing the Diet again.]\r\n\r\n\"Hiding ourselves away among the rocks, we waited until a flock of the\r\nbirds flew over us. They flew very low,--not more than five feet above\r\nour heads. When they were least expecting it, I threw up the net, and\r\nthree of them flew bang into it. They were so much stunned by the blow,\r\nthat only one of them could flutter out before I had drawn in the net;\r\nand the Dean was quick enough to seize the remaining two before they\r\ncould escape. This, being the first experiment, gave us great\r\nencouragement, as it was more successful than we had ventured to hope.\r\nWe went on with the work, without pausing, for several hours, looking\r\nupon it as great sport, as indeed it was; and since it was the first\r\nthing we had done on the island that seemed like sport, the day was\r\nalways remembered by us with delight.\r\n\r\n\"So now you see we had begun to mingle a little pleasure with our life;\r\nand this was a very important matter, for you know the old saying, 'All\r\nwork and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Mariner takes the Little People on a Little\r\nVoyage; and the Little People become convinced that an\r\nArctic Winter, an Aurora Borealis, and an Ancient\r\nMariner, are very Wonderful Things.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lively breeze was blowing over the little village of Rockdale, and in\r\na lively way the tall trees were bending down their heads, and swinging\r\nto and fro as if they liked it; for the leaves were beating time, and\r\nwere singing joyously, and appeared to be saying all the while how glad\r\nthey would be to keep beating time and singing on forever, if the wind\r\nwould only please to be so good as to help them on in the joyous\r\nbusiness; and the tall grass and grain were shining in the sun, and\r\nrolling round in a very reckless manner, as if they meant to show off\r\ntheir great billows of green and gold, and make the staid and sober\r\nlittle waves that were ruffling up the surface of the bright blue waters\r\nof the bay quite ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed our ancient friend, the Captain, when he saw what a\r\nday it was. \"Ha, ha! what a day indeed!\" and right away he began to call\r\nloudly for his boy, Main Brace,--\r\n\r\n\"Main Brace, Main Brace, come here! Come, bear a hand, and be lively\r\nthere, you plum-duff, chuckle-headed young landlubber, and waddle along\r\naft here on your sausage legs.\"\r\n\r\nA feeble voice is heard to answer from the galley,--\"Ay, ay, sir;\r\ncomin', sir, comin'\"; and the plum-duff head and the sausage legs follow\r\nfeebly in after the voice, looking surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Main Brace,\"--begins the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" responds Main Brace; and the plum-duff head lets fall its\r\nlower jaw, and looks amazed, the Captain is so much in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Some bait, Main Brace! Do you hear, my lad? Be lively, boy, and get\r\nsome bait; and then overhaul the _Alice_, and stand by to be ready when\r\nI come down. We'll go a-fishing to-day,--do you hear, my boy? And we'll\r\nhave a jolly time,--do you hear that? So be lively now, and be off with\r\nyour plum-duff head and your sausage legs. I tell you, away, away! for\r\nwe'll go a-sailin'. Away, away! for we'll go a-sailin', a-sailin',\r\na-sailin'. Away, away! for we'll go a-sailin',--a-sailin' on the sea.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word the sausage legs made off with the plum-duff head,\r\nwhich had no sooner got outside the door than it began to let out in\r\ndislocated fragments, from a mouth that gradually expanded until it\r\nreached from ear to ear, \"Away, away! we'll go a-fishin', a-fishin',\r\na-fishin'; away, away! we'll go a-sailin', a-sailin', a-sailin'; away,\r\naway! we'll all be jolly, jolly, jolly,--we'll all be jolly\"; and so on\r\nuntil the sausage legs had carried the plum-duff head and the refrain\r\ntogether so far down among the trees, towards the water, that all the\r\nother \"jollys\" and the sailin's and the \"fishin's,\" and the rest of it,\r\nwere blown clean away by the wind.\r\n\r\nAnd off went the Captain, too, hurrying up to the top of the hill behind\r\nthe cottage, as if the cosey little thing was all afire, and the dear\r\nold soul was running up for help; and when he reached the top of the\r\nhill, he began swinging round his old tarpaulin hat, making the long\r\nblue ribbons fairly whistle and speak, as if they would say, \"Old man,\r\nold man, stop a bit, and take breath!--can't you now? and say, what's\r\nthis all about, for goodness' sake!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ancient Mariner becomes excited, and Main Brace makes\r\nan effort.]\r\n\r\nBut the old man knew well enough himself what it was all about; for he\r\nwas signalling his little friends; and every circle of his big arm, and\r\nevery shake of his long gray beard, and every swing of his old tarpaulin\r\nhat, seemed to sing out, \"Hurrah, hurrah, for a jolly day! hurrah,\r\nhurrah, my children gay! hurrah, hurrah, let's up and away, upon the\r\nbright blue waters!\"\r\n\r\nBy and by the children caught sight of the old tarpaulin hat and the\r\nblue ribbons and the Captain himself, all in this state of violent\r\nexcitement; and down they bore at once upon the ancient mariner, as if\r\nhe were a regular bluff-bowed old East Indiaman, full of golden ingots,\r\nand they were clipper-built, copper-fastened, rakish fore-and-afters of\r\nthe piratical pattern.\r\n\r\n\"Heyday!\" (the old man never thought he had begun until he had thrown\r\noff a heyday or so), \"heyday, my hearties!\" said the ancient mariner, as\r\nthe children came up to him,--\"heyday, my dears! keep on that same\r\ncourse before the wind, and you'll fetch up in the right port\"; and so,\r\nwithout further ado, he hurried \"my hearties\" down to the beach, and\r\naboard the yacht; and then very soon Main Brace (whose mouth had never\r\nleft off expanding at the prospect of \"a fishin'\" and \"a sailin'\" and \"a\r\njolly day\" generally) had the anchor away; and then the Captain spread\r\nthe white sails to the lively breeze; and there never was, since the\r\nworld began, a merrier little party, in a merrier little craft, afloat\r\nupon blue water on a merrier day. Indeed, the day was so merry, and the\r\ncraft was so merry, and the waves were so merry as they came leaping\r\nround the yacht, and the wind was so merry as it bulged out the sail and\r\nwent whistling through the rigging, and the little party in the yacht\r\nwere so merry, and everything and everybody was so merry, that it would\r\nbe strange indeed if the fish were not merry too; and the finny\r\ncreatures played round the pretty hooks, too merry by half to touch\r\nthem; and then they came merrily up, and poked their heads out close to\r\nthe top of the water, and stared at the merry-makers in the yacht, and\r\nthey seemed to be whispering to one another, \"O, what a jolly lot of\r\ncoves they are, to be sure! O, don't they wish they may catch\r\nus?--don't they though?\" and then they dropped down again to look at the\r\npretty hooks; but only the sober-sided ones that had no idea of being\r\nmerry went near enough to bite, and these were surely bitten in return;\r\nfor, if the hook once got into their red gills, they found themselves\r\njerked up before they could say Lobster, and heard merry voices shouting\r\nround them, to their great astonishment.\r\n\r\nAnd of these sober-sided fishes who were so unfortunate as to have no\r\nidea of being merry, the Captain and his little friends caught as many\r\nas they wanted; and then the Captain said to his little friends, \"Put\r\naway your fishing-tackle now, and come down below into the little cabin,\r\nand I'll surprise you.\" And, sure enough, he did surprise them,--quite\r\nas much, perhaps, as if some fairy queen had come, and called them to a\r\nfairy banquet; as much indeed, perhaps, as if they had themselves\r\nsuddenly been turned to fairies, and were doing something that was never\r\neven dreamed of by mortal child before; for, while they had been\r\nfishing, Main Brace had, by direction of the Captain, been building up a\r\nfire in the little stove, and in the very centre of the cabin he had set\r\nout a little table, and upon the little table there was spread the\r\nwhitest little cloth, and on the cloth were set all round the daintiest\r\nlittle plates and knives and forks, and the neatest little napkins, and\r\nthe cunningest little cups, that were ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" spoke up the Captain, laughing all the while to see his\r\nlittle friends so much surprised, \"fall to, fall to! for we're going to\r\nhave a jolly feast, or my name isn't Ancient Mariner, nor John Hardy\r\neither.\" And the Captain poured out some fresh foaming milk into the\r\ncunning little cups, from a big stone jug; and he brought some fresh\r\nwhite rolls and some golden butter from a little locker; and soon\r\nafterward he drew from the little stove some dainty little fish, and\r\ndropped one, all crisp and hissing hot, upon each dainty little plate;\r\nand now for half an hour there was busy work enough for the dainty\r\nlittle knives and forks. The Captain's little stove proved to be\r\neverything that one could wish for in that line; and the Captain's style\r\nof cooking showed plainly enough, as William said, that \"the Captain had\r\nnot travelled round the world, and been an ancient mariner, for\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, and everything was cleared away, and the little\r\ncabin was once more in ship-shape order, William proposed the Captain's\r\nhealth,--tossing back his head, and drinking a great quantity of\r\nimaginary wine from an imaginary glass. \"Here's to the health of Captain\r\nHardy, ancient mariner, and other things too numerous to mention,--the\r\njolliest Jack Tar that ever reefed a sail, or walked on the windward\r\nside of a quarter-deck! May Davy Jones be a long while waiting for him;\r\nand when he does go into Davy's locker, may he go an Admiral!\" And then\r\nthe children all together \"Hip, hip, hurrahed\" the Captain, until the\r\nold man had nearly split himself with laughing at their childish\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And now for the story,\" said the Captain, when the laugh was ended.\r\n\"What do you say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The story,--yes, yes, the story,\" shouted all the children, merrier\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\"Down here, or up on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down here, just where we are; it's such a splendid place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then down here it shall be,\" went on the Captain, right well pleased.\r\n\"Down here it shall be, my dears, if I can only pick up the yarn again\r\nwhere I broke it off. Let me see\"; and the old man put a finger to his\r\nnose, as he always did when he was thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" cried he, at length, \"I've got my bearings now, as neat as a\r\nlight-house in a fog. You know, my dears, when we left off last time, we\r\nhad gone so far along with the story that you could see the Dean and I\r\nhad got ourselves in soundings, as it were. We had seen the light-ship\r\noff the harbor, and were steering for it, so to speak. We had, by\r\nworking very hard, and by persevering very much, and by using our wits\r\nas best we could, gathered about us everything that was needed to insure\r\nour present safety, and some things to make us comfortable. We had a hut\r\nto shelter us, and clothes to keep us warm, and fire to cook our food.\r\n\r\n\"But the winter was now coming on very fast, and we knew well enough\r\nwhat that was likely to be. The grass and moss and flowers were dead or\r\ndying; the ice was forming on the little pools, and here and there upon\r\nthe sea; little spurts of snow were coming now and then; the winds were\r\ngetting to be more fierce and angry, and every day was growing colder\r\nand more dark. We knew that the long winter was close upon us, and that\r\nthe shadow of the night would soon be resting on us all the time. The\r\nbirds had hatched their young, and quitted their nests, and were flying\r\noff to the sunny south, where we so longed to go, and so longed to send\r\na message by them to the loved ones far away. It made us sad--O, how\r\nvery, very sad!--to see the birds so happy on the wing, and sailing off\r\nand leaving us upon the island all alone. Alone,--all, all alone! Alone\r\nupon a desert island in the Frozen Sea! Alone in cold and darkness! All,\r\nall alone!\r\n\r\n\"We made ourselves warm coats and stockings out of the skins of the\r\nbirds that we had caught; and we made caps, too, out of them,--plucking\r\noff the feathers, and leaving only the soft, warm, mouse-colored down\r\nupon the skin. And out of the seal's skin we made mittens and nice soft\r\nboots, or rather, as I might call them, moccasins.\r\n\r\n\"The birds began to go away about the middle of August, as nearly as we\r\ncould tell, but it was more than a month after that before they had all\r\nleft the island. Meanwhile we had caught a great number of them,--two\r\nhundred and sixty-six in all; and we had collected, besides, ninety\r\ndozen of their eggs. These birds and eggs were all carefully stowed away\r\nin our storehouses of ice and rocks near the glacier.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of food, we had, therefore, done very well; but we felt\r\nthe need of some more blubber for our fire, and some warmer clothing\r\nthan the birds' skins. To supply this latter want, we tried very hard to\r\ncatch some foxes; but it was a long time before we were successful; for\r\nnot until all the ducks had gone away would the foxes trouble themselves\r\nto go inside our traps. These traps were made of stones, and in building\r\nthem I had derived the only benefit which had ever resulted to me from\r\nmy indolent life on the farm. I was always fond of shirking away from my\r\nduties, and going into the woods to set rabbit-traps; and, remembering\r\nhow I made them of wood, I easily contrived a stone one of the same\r\npattern, and it was found afterwards to answer perfectly; for when there\r\nwere no longer eggs and ducks for them to eat, the foxes went into our\r\ntraps, which we baited with flesh from the dead narwhal. The pelts of\r\nthese foxes were thick and warm; and, by the time the weather got very\r\ncold, we had obtained a good number, and of them we made suits of\r\nclothes at our leisure. There were two kinds of foxes; one was a sort\r\nof blue gray, and the other was quite white.\r\n\r\n\"As the weather grew colder, the little streams which had thus far\r\nsupplied us with water all froze up; and we had now nothing to depend\r\nupon but the freshly fallen snow, which we had, of course, to melt. Thus\r\nyou see how important it was that I should have found the soapstone in\r\nseason, and made a pot of it, else we should not only have been obliged\r\nto go without boiled food, but likewise without water. As for fuel, we\r\nwere for the present relieved from all anxiety by a dead walrus and a\r\nsmall white whale which drifted in upon the beach during a westerly\r\ngale. The waves being very strong, they were landed so high up on the\r\nbeach that there was little fear of their being washed away again.\r\n\r\n\"It was no easy matter to cut these animals up with our one jack-knife,\r\nsince, before we could get it done, they had frozen quite hard. The\r\ntemperature had gone down until it was already below freezing all the\r\ntime; and very soon a great deal of snow fell, and was drifted into\r\nheaps by the wind. The sea, soon after this, became frozen over quite\r\nsolid all about the island, although we could still see plenty of clear,\r\nopen water in the distance. There was one satisfaction, at least, in\r\nthis freezing up of the sea: we could walk out upon it, and go all\r\naround the island without having to clamber over the rough rocks.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You have now seen pretty much what our life was on the island, and how\r\nwe were prepared for the winter. Well, the winter came by and by in good\r\nearnest, I can tell you. The sunlight all went away, and then, soon\r\nafterward, the autumn twilight went away; and then came the darkness\r\nthat I told you is constant, in the winter, up towards the North Pole,\r\nfor the winter there is but one long night, you know.\"\r\n\r\nHere William, who was, as we have seen, of an inquiring turn of mind,\r\ninterrupted the Captain to ask if he would not be so good as to mention\r\nagain how dark it was in this polar winter.\r\n\r\n\"Dark as midnight,\" replied the Captain, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Dark all the time, did you say, Captain Hardy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dark all the time, my lad,--dark in the morning, dark in the\r\nevening, dark at midnight, dark at noon, dark, all the time, as any\r\nnight you ever saw; only, everything being white with snow, of course\r\nmakes the night lighter than it does here, where the trees and the\r\nhouses, and other dark objects, help along the blackness and make it\r\nmore gloomy,--absorbing the light, you see, while the snow reflects it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what,\" asked William, \"did you do for light in this dark time,\r\nsince you did not have a lamp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy there, my lad,\" replied the Captain; \"I'm just coming to that, you\r\nsee. Somebody has said that 'necessity is the mother of invention,' or\r\nwords to that effect; and darkness, I think, may be considered a\r\n'mother' of that description. First we made an open dish of soapstone,\r\nand put some oil in it; and then we made a wick out of the dry moss, and\r\nset fire to it; but this was found to make so much smoke that it drove\r\nus out of the hut, and it was given up. But we did not throw away the\r\ndish, and after a while it occurred to us to powder the dry moss by\r\nrubbing it between the hands, and with this powdered moss we lined our\r\nsoapstone dish all over on the inside with a layer a quarter of an inch\r\nthick. After smoothing this down all around the edge (this dish, which\r\nwe called a lamp, was much like a saucer, only rougher and much\r\nlarger), we filled it half full of oil, and again set fire to it all\r\naround the edge; and this time it worked beautifully,--smoking very\r\nlittle, and giving us plenty of light.\"\r\n\r\n\"How cunning!\" exclaimed the children, all at once.\r\n\r\n\"Rather so,\" replied the Captain, \"but hardly more so than the two\r\nlittle drinking-cups we carved out of the same kind of soapstone that we\r\nmade the lamp and pot of.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have felt very queer, Captain Hardy,\" said Fred, inquiringly,\r\n\"to be in darkness all the time. I can't imagine such a thing as the\r\nwinter being all the time dark,--can you, Will?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't,\" replied William,--\"can you, Sister Alice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I can,\" said Alice, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how's that, my little dear?\" asked the Captain, greatly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said Alice, in her gentle way, \"I've only to think of poor blind Jo\r\ngoing round with his little dog, begging from door to door, and never\r\nseeing anything in all the world,--no sun, no moon, no stars, no any\r\nlight to him at all. Poor Jo's bright summer went out long ago; and both\r\nlight and warmth were gone, never to come back again, when old Martha\r\ndied! and all's night to Jo,--and that's how I know what it is to be in\r\ndarkness all the time\"; and as little Alice made this little speech\r\nabout poor blind Jo, the beggar-man, her lovely face looked thoughtful\r\nbeyond its years; and, as she finished, the Captain saw a tear stealing\r\nfrom her soft blue eye for poor Jo's sake; and he caught her in his arms\r\nright off, without stopping to think at all what he was doing, and he\r\nkissed away the tear; and, as he did it, a much bigger one came tearing\r\nout of his own great hazel eye, and hurried down into his shaggy beard\r\nto hide, as if it were quite frightened at what it had been doing with\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like the little lady that you are, my dear,\" broke out the\r\nCaptain; \"always thinking of the unfortunate. And you are very right, my\r\nchild. Poor blind Jo's darkness is much worse than ours ever was, up in\r\nthe Frozen Sea, upon the lonely island,--far worse indeed, poor man! for\r\nyou must know that the stars were shining brightly there upon us all the\r\ntime; and then the moon came every month; and when it came, it came for\r\ngood and all, and never set for several days; and then sometimes the\r\naurora borealis would flash across the heavens, and clear away the\r\ndarkness for a little while, as if it were a huge broom sweeping cobwebs\r\nfrom the skies, and letting in the light of day beneath the stars. O,\r\nwhat a splendid sight it was!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, tell us all about it, Captain Hardy, won't you?\" asked all the\r\nchildren, with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I will,\" replied the Captain, \"only I can do no sort of\r\njustice to that species of natural scenery, don't you see? That's a\r\ntouch beyond John Hardy's powers of description, as I can well assure\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe children all declared that they never could think anything beyond\r\nJohn Hardy's powers, and they believed it too.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! Now let me see, my dears, what I can do for you. First, you\r\nknow the scientific chaps, especially my friend the Doctor, down in\r\nBoston, say that the aurora borealis is electricity broke loose, and\r\ntearing through the air, from pole to pole, for some purpose of its own.\r\nIt can't be caught, nor bottled up, as Franklin bottled up the\r\nlightning, nor analyzed;--in short, nothing can be done with it; and so\r\nit goes tearing through the skies, as I have said before, from pole to\r\npole, just where it likes.\r\n\r\n\"Now this is what it is, so far as one can see. When you go away beyond\r\nthe Arctic Circle, you see great fiery streams start up from a fiery\r\narch that stretches right across the sky before you; and from this fiery\r\narch the fiery streams of light shoot up, and then fall back\r\nagain,--sometimes lasting for a little while, and waving in the sky, to\r\nand fro, like a silken curtain of many colors fluttering in the wind;\r\nand then again seeming to be phantom things playing hide-and-seek among\r\nthe stars; sometimes like wicked spirits of the night, bent on mischief;\r\nsometimes like tongues of flame from some great fire in some great world\r\nbeyond the earth, making one almost afraid that the heavens will break\r\nout presently in a roaring blaze, and rain a shower of living coals and\r\nashes on his head.\r\n\r\n\"And O, how grand the colors are sometimes! The great arch of light that\r\nspans the sky is often bright with all the colors of the\r\nrainbow,--changing every instant. And from these flickering belts of\r\nlight the fiery streams fly up with lightning speed,--green, and orange,\r\nand blue, and purple, and bright crimson,--all mingling here and there\r\nand everywhere above, while down beneath comes out in bold relief before\r\nthe eye the broad, white plain of ice and snow upon the ocean, the great\r\nicebergs that lie here and there upon it, the tall white mountains of\r\nthe land, and the dark islands in the sea; and then the flood of light\r\ndies away, and the dark islands in the sea, and the tall white\r\nmountains, and the icebergs, and the white plain around, all vanish from\r\nthe sight, and the mind retains only an impression that the icebergs,\r\nwith all these bright hues reflected on them from above, had come from\r\nspace and darkness, like the meteors, then to vanish, and leave the\r\ndarkness more profound.\r\n\r\n\"And thus the auroral light and color keep pulsating in the air, up and\r\ndown, up and down; and thus the icebergs seem to come and go; and the\r\nvery stars above seem to be rushing out with a bold bright glare, and\r\ngoing back again as quickly, singed and withered, as it were, into puny\r\nsparks, and, utterly disheartened with the effort to keep their places\r\nin the face of such a flood of brightness, are at length resolved no\r\nmore to try to twinkle, twinkle through the night.\r\n\r\n\"And that is all I can tell you about the aurora borealis, for that is\r\nall I know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, isn't he a great one?\" whispered William to Fred, who sat close\r\nbeside him on the locker,--\"isn't he, indeed?--to say he can't describe\r\nan aurora borealis, when he has blood, thunder, fire, and all creation\r\non his tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" went on the Captain, \"in spite of this auroral light and the\r\nmoonlight, the winter was dreary enough. At first we wanted to sleep all\r\nthe time; and we had much trouble to keep ourselves from giving way to\r\nthis desire. If we had done so, it would have made us very unhealthy and\r\naltogether miserable. We had to keep up our spirits, whatever else we\r\ndid; and after a while, to help us with this, we got into regular\r\nhabits; and we set a great clock up in the sky to tell us the time of\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"A clock up in the sky!\" exclaimed both the boys; \"why, Captain Hardy,\r\nhow was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see, my lads, the 'Great Bear' and all the other\r\nconstellations of the north go round and round the Pole-star, which is\r\nright above your head; and it so happened that I knew the 'Great Bear,'\r\nand the two stars in its side called 'the Pointers' because they point\r\nto the Pole-star. Now these two 'Pointers,' going around once in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, pointed up from the south at one time, and up\r\nfrom the north at another time, and up from the east and from the west\r\nin the same way; and thus you see we had a clock up in the sky to tell\r\nus the time of day, for we had an iceberg picked out all around for\r\nevery hour, and when 'the Pointers' stood over that particular berg we\r\nknew what time it was.\r\n\r\n\"We should have got along through the winter much more comfortably if we\r\nhad had some books, or some paper to write on, and pen and ink to write\r\nwith; but these things were quite beyond the reach of our ingenuity. So\r\nour life was very monotonous; doing our daily duties,--that is, whatever\r\nwe might find to do,--and, after wading through the deep snow in doing\r\nit, we came back again to our little hut to get warm, and to eat and\r\ntalk and sleep.\r\n\r\n\"And much talking we did, as I can assure you, about each other, and\r\neach other's life, and what great things we would do when we got away\r\nfrom the island, hopeless though that seemed. Thus we came gradually to\r\nknow each other's history, and thus there came to be greater sympathy\r\nbetween us, and more indulgence of each other's whims and fancies, as we\r\ngot better and better acquainted.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean had quite a story to relate of himself. He told me that he was\r\nborn in the great city of New York. His father died before he could\r\nremember, and his mother was very poor; but so long as she kept her\r\nhealth she managed, in one way or another, to live along from day to day\r\nby sewing; and she managed, too, to send the Dean to school. She loved\r\nher bright-haired little boy so very, very much that she would have\r\nspent the last cent she could ever earn, could she only give her darling\r\nDean a little knowledge that might help him on in the world when he grew\r\nto be a man. And so she stinted herself and saved, all unknown to her\r\ndarling Dean; and she had not clothing or fire enough to keep her warm\r\nin the bleak winter, when the Dean was out, though she had a fine fire\r\nwhen the Dean came back. All would have been well enough if the poor\r\nwoman had not, with her hard work and her efforts to save, become thin\r\nand weak, and then grown sick with fever; and now there was nothing for\r\nher but the hospital, for there was no money to pay for medicines, or\r\ndoctor's bills, to say nothing of rent and fire and clothes.\r\n\r\n\"And now for the first time the Dean began to realize the situation; and\r\na vague impression crossed his mind, that the poor, pale woman, now\r\nrestless with pain on a narrow bed in a great long ward of a dreary\r\nhospital,--his own dear mother, suffering here with strange hands only\r\nto comfort her,--had been brought to this for his sake; and when she\r\ngrew better, after a long, long time, but was still far from well, he\r\nthought and thought, and cried and cried, and prayed and prayed, and\r\nwished that he might do something to show his gratitude, and make\r\namends.\r\n\r\n\"By and by he got into a factory, and worked there early and late, until\r\nhe too grew sick, and was carried to the hospital, and was laid beside\r\nhis poor sick mother, on a narrow bed. But he soon got well again,\r\nthough his mother did not, and then (he could do nothing else) he went\r\nto sea as cabin-boy of a ship sailing to Havana; and he came back too;\r\nand, with a proud heart beating in his little breast, he carried a\r\nlittle purse of gold and silver coins that the captain gave him to his\r\npoor sick mother; and then he went away again on the same ship, and came\r\nback once more with another purse of money, twice as big as the first;\r\nbut the good captain that had been so kind to him, and rewarded him so\r\nwell, fell sick, and died of yellow fever on the passage home, and the\r\nmate, who got command of the ship, being a different sort of man,\r\ndisliked the Dean, and told him not to come back any more. And so the\r\npoor Dean didn't know what to do; until one of his old shipmates met him\r\nin the street, and took him off to New Bedford, and shipped him as\r\ncabin-boy of the _Blackbird_. 'And now here I am,' said the poor little\r\nDean, 'and all the rest you know,--cast away in the cold, in this awful\r\nplace, while my poor sick mother has no money and no friends in all the\r\nworld, and is thinking all the time what a wretch I am to run away and\r\ndesert her, when, God knows, I meant to do nothing of the sort!' and so\r\nthe Dean burst out crying, and, to tell you the truth, I could not help\r\ncrying a little too.\r\n\r\n\"But the Dean was a right plucky little fellow, I can tell you; and so\r\nfull of hope and ambition was he, that nothing could keep him down very\r\nlong; and nothing, I believe, could ever make him despond for a single\r\nminute but thinking of his mother, sick and far away, without friends or\r\nmoney, lying on a narrow bed, all through the weary, dreary days and\r\nnights, in the dreary ward of a crowded hospital. Poor Dean! he had\r\nsomething to make him cry, and something always to make him sad, if he\r\nhad a mind to be; but what had I in comparison?--I who had gone away\r\nfrom home with no good motive like the Dean's.\r\n\r\n\"After the recital of this story of the Dean's, we were both very sad,\r\nuntil the Dean suddenly roused himself, and said, 'Let's go and look at\r\nour traps, Hardy'; and so we sallied out into the moonlight, and waded\r\nthrough the snow, to see if there were any foxes for us. To get outside\r\nour hut was not so easy a matter now as it was when we first built it;\r\nfor, in order to keep the cold winds away, we had made a long, low,\r\nnarrow passage, with a crook in it, through which we crawled on our\r\nhands and knees, before we reached the door.\r\n\r\n\"We walked all the way around the island, and visited all our traps, of\r\nwhich we had seventeen, but only two of them had foxes in them; the\r\nothers were either filled with snow, or were completely covered over\r\nwith it, for the wind had been blowing very hard the day before.\r\n\r\n\"As we got farther and farther into the winter, we met with some very\r\nstrange adventures,--altogether different from anything I have told you\r\nof before; but you see the sun will soon be going down behind the trees,\r\nand we are a good long way from the 'Mariner's Rest,' so 'up anchor' 's\r\nthe word now, my dears, and 'under way' again.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe merry little yacht was not long in carrying the merry little party\r\nover to the Captain's favorite anchorage; and then they were all soon\r\nashore, and after many merry and many pleasant speeches, our little\r\nfriends parted from the ancient mariner once more, leaving him standing\r\nin the shadow of the great tall trees, with a string of fish in one\r\nhand; while Fred and William, with Main Brace to help them, and with\r\nmerry Alice running on ahead, each carried off a string for their next\r\nday's breakfast,--a trophy to be proud of, as they thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nProves the Ingenuity of Seals, and Shows That the Great\r\nPolar Bear Is No Respecter of Persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When we were last time cruising in the _Alice_, I think I told you all\r\nabout the Arctic winter,--did I not?\" said the ancient mariner to his\r\nlittle friends, when they were met once more.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered William (who was always ready to act as spokesman for\r\nthe party),--\"yes, Captain Hardy, all about the Arctic winter, and the\r\naurora borealis, and the wonderful moonlight, and the darkness, and how\r\nyou and the handsome little Dean lived through it, and what you talked\r\nabout, and how you passed the time, and what a doleful life you led, and\r\nwhat a dreadful thing it was, and how it made you shiver now to think of\r\nit; and--all that, and a great deal more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Captain, \"certainly, that's it,--all told off\r\nnicely, my lad, just as if you were boxing the compass or repeating the\r\nmultiplication table;--all about how we protected ourselves from cold,\r\nand kept ourselves from hunger, and prepared a home for ourselves on the\r\nRock of Good Hope. And this seemed likely to be our home for life\r\ntoo,--so far, at least, as we could see; for it appeared clear enough to\r\nus that our condition would never change except with death, which we,\r\nlike everybody else, whether they have ever been cast away or not,\r\nwanted to put off as long as possible, having no wish at all to die, and\r\nnot liking either to freeze or starve: so you see we had good motives\r\nfor energy and patience.\"\r\n\r\nHere little Alice, in her quiet way, interrupted the Captain to say that\r\nthe aurora borealis had troubled her dreams all night, and that she\r\nwould like to know, if the Captain pleased, why anything should have\r\nsuch a strange name.\r\n\r\n\"That I will tell you with pleasure, my dear,\" answered the Captain;\r\n\"I'll tell you all about it,--of course I will. Aurora borealis,--that\r\nmeans northern light; and the name comes from a pagan goddess called\r\nAurora, who was supposed to have rosy fingers, and to ride in a rosy\r\nchariot, and who opened the gates of the East every morning, and brought\r\nin the light of day; and thus, in course of time, any great flush of\r\nlight in the heavens got to be called Aurora. And then there was a pagan\r\ngod called Boreas, who was the North Wind, and had long wings and white\r\nhair, and made himself generally disagreeable. So you see Boreas, from\r\nbeing the pagan name for north wind, got to mean the north; and\r\nBorealis, from that, became Northern, and Aurora Borealis became\r\nNorthern Light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Captain Hardy,\" said little Alice; and Fred and William said\r\n\"Thank you\" too; while, as for the Captain, he looked very wise and\r\nsolemn, like other great philosophers, appearing as if he would say,\r\n\"Don't be surprised, for that's nothing to what I could do if I had a\r\nmind,\" every word of which the children would have believed, you may\r\nwell be sure. However, the Captain hastened on with the story (which is\r\nmore to our present purpose) without giving any further proof of his\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n\"When the winter had fairly set in,\" said he, \"our field of operations\r\nwas much enlarged; and, although the birds had all flown away, we were\r\nhardly worse off than before, as you shall see; for all through the\r\nsummer we had been kept close prisoners on the island; but now, when\r\nthe ice was solid all over the sea, we could walk out upon it, and this\r\nwe did as soon as it would bear. Once the Dean broke through, being a\r\nlittle careless of where he was stepping; but I got him out, with no\r\nmore harm coming to him than a cold bath and a fright.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after this we made a valuable discovery. Some of the seals have a\r\nhabit, when the sea is frozen over, of cutting holes through the ice\r\nwith their sharp claws, in order that they may get their heads above the\r\nwater to breathe,--the seals not being able, as I have told you before,\r\nto breathe under water, like fish. They can keep their heads under water\r\nabout an hour, by closing up their nostrils, so that not a drop can get\r\nin; and, during that time, they do not breathe at all; but at last they\r\nmust find the open sea, or a crack in the ice, or else dig a hole\r\nthrough the ice from below, and thus get their heads to the surface in\r\nsome way, or they would drown.\r\n\r\n\"As we did not then know anything about the habits of the seals in this\r\nrespect, I was very much surprised one day, while walking over ice that\r\nwas everywhere apparently very solid, to find one of my feet suddenly\r\nbreak through. I was carrying, at the time, our great narwhal horn,\r\nwhich had already been used for so many purposes; and when I had got my\r\nfoot, as quickly as possible, out of the water, I pounded with the heavy\r\nhorn all about the place, and found that there was a large round hole\r\nthere that had evidently been made by some animal; and I could think of\r\nnothing else as likely to have made it but a seal. The reason why I had\r\nnot seen it was because the snow had drifted over it in a hard crust,\r\nand through this crust the seal kept open with his nose a small orifice\r\nfor breathing, that was not larger round than a silver dollar.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery made us very glad and very curious,--for, having\r\nconcluded what it was, we concluded also that there must be more like\r\nit, and we went in search of them immediately. Our search was soon\r\nrewarded, for these seal-holes were very numerous.\r\n\r\n\"How to catch a seal was the question which now most occupied our\r\nthoughts. The difficulty was very great, for we had no weapons of any\r\nsort for such a purpose. Once more, however, we fell back upon our\r\nnarwhal horn. To this horn we had already become much attached, and, as\r\nif to express our gratitude, we had bestowed upon it several names,--as,\r\nfor instance, 'Life-preserver,' 'Crumply Crowbar,' 'The Castaway's\r\nFriend,' and the like of that; but the title which finally stuck to it\r\nwas 'Old Crumply,'--not that it was exactly a crumply horn, like the one\r\nthat grew on the head of the cow that tossed the dog, that worried the\r\ncat, that killed the rat, that ate the malt, that lay in the house that\r\nJack built,--for it was not crumply at all in that sense, but, on the\r\ncontrary, was as straight as an arrow, and was no further crumply than\r\ncrumply means wrinkled and twisted; and, indeed, the old horn looked as\r\nif it might have been once red-hot, and had been twisted several times\r\naround before it had cooled off.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this 'Old Crumply,' we made another weapon, in quite an\r\ningenious way, as we thought, though at a great expense of time and\r\nlabor. This was called by several names, like the other; but generally I\r\ncalled it the 'Dean's Delight,' for it was made after the Dean's idea,\r\nand he used to flourish it about at a great rate, and was very proud of\r\nit. It was simply a kind of spear made by lashing together (after\r\ncarefully cutting with our knife, and fitting and overlapping) a great\r\nmany pieces of bones. The lashing was the same string or thong we had\r\nbefore used for the duck-traps. It was very strong, though not half so\r\nheavy as 'Old Crumply.'\r\n\r\n\"But though we had 'Old Crumply,' and the 'Dean's Delight,' we were\r\napparently just as far off as ever from catching a seal. The 'Delight'\r\nwas tipped with hard ivory (a piece of walrus tusk carved into proper\r\nshape with the jack-knife), and 'Crumply' was of the very best kind of\r\nivory throughout, yet we could not sharpen either of them so as to be of\r\nmuch use. But, remembering the general shape of the harpoon-heads used\r\nin whale-ships, I managed to cut one of that pattern out of walrus\r\nivory, and this I set on the end of the 'Dean's Delight,' and then,\r\nmaking a hole in the centre of it, I fastened it to the end of one of\r\nour long lines. And thus I had obtained all that was needed, in name at\r\nleast, for catching a seal; but only in name, as was soon proved; for\r\nthe Dean and I set out at once to try our fortunes in this new line of\r\nadventure, and, discovering a seal-hole, we stood near it (on the\r\nleeward side, that the seal might not scent us) until the animal\r\nappeared, which was not for a long time, and not until we had grown very\r\ncold. The seal had evidently been off breathing in another hole. When he\r\ndid come up, we knew it by a little puff he gave, which threw some spray\r\nup through the little orifice in the snow-crust. Quick as thought I\r\nplunged the 'Dean's Delight' down into the very centre of the hole, and\r\nstruck the animal; but the ivory harpoon-head that was on the end of it\r\nonly glanced off, without penetrating the skin; and the seal, no doubt\r\nvery much astonished, got off as quickly as he could, more frightened,\r\nprobably, than hurt; at least, we heard of him no more. He never came\r\nback to the hole, for it was all frozen over next day, and so it\r\nremained. We afterwards discovered that when a seal-hole has been once\r\ntouched, the seal will never go back to it.\r\n\r\n\"I was now more puzzled than ever to know what to do; but I did not give\r\nup trying, determined to succeed, one way or another. Presently it\r\noccurred to me that almost anything that was hard would answer to\r\nsharpen the edge and point of the ivory harpoon-head, and, since I could\r\nnot get any kind of metal to make a whole harpoon-head out of, I had to\r\ntry some other plan. As good luck would have it, I now thought of the\r\nbrass buttons on my coat. Some of these I quickly tore off. Then I\r\nhacked my knife with a sharp flint stone until I had made a saw of it,\r\nand with this saw I cut a little groove along the tapering point of the\r\nivory harpoon-head; and into this groove, which was about a quarter of\r\nan inch deep, I set the buttons, which I had squared with the knife, and\r\nthen wedged them firmly. I had now only to grind all these bits of brass\r\ndown even, and to sharpen the whole with a stone, and my work was done.\r\nAnd a most tedious work it had been too. The next thing was to put it to\r\nthe test, which we quickly did. A seal-hole being soon found, we had not\r\nlong to wait before the seal came into it, with a little puff, as\r\nbefore; and, as soon as the noise was heard, I let fly with my harpoon,\r\nand, striking through the snow-crust, hit the seal fairly in the neck,\r\nand drove the harpoon into him.\r\n\r\n\"Down sank the seal through the hole, taking the harpoon along with him,\r\nand spinning out the line which was attached to it at a furious rate.\r\nBefore the seal was struck, and while I was watching for him, the Dean\r\nhad quietly tied the end of the line that was not fast to the harpoon\r\naround the middle of 'Old Crumply,' and when the seal descended into\r\nthe sea, 'Old Crumply' was whipped along over the snow until it lodged\r\nright across the hole, and there the seal was,--'brought up with a round\r\nturn,' as the sailors say.\r\n\r\n\"And now was anybody ever so rejoiced as we? The Dean fairly shouted\r\nwith delight, and danced around the hole as if he were crazy, crying\r\n'Bravo, bravo!' and 'Hurrah for Crumply' and 'Hurrah for Old Crumply!'\r\nand hurrah for this, and hurrah for that, until he was fairly hoarse.\r\nMeanwhile the seal was trying his best to get away. He darted from side\r\nto side, and up and down, without any other result than to tire himself\r\nout; for the harpoon held firmly in his body, and the line held firmly\r\nto 'Old Crumply,' and 'Old Crumply' lay squarely across the hole.\r\n\r\n\"By and by the seal was forced to come up to breathe; and, since there\r\nwas no other place for him, he had to return to the hole where he had\r\nbeen struck. But he did not stay more than a second or so, going down as\r\nquickly as he had done before. As soon as the line was loosened,\r\nhowever, we drew in the slack, and wound it around 'Old Crumply,' so\r\nthat the seal did not have so much of it now to play with. Nor did he\r\nremain under so long the second time. When he came up again, we got in\r\nall the slack of the line that we could, as before.\r\n\r\n\"It was now clear enough that we should be sure of the seal, if we could\r\nonly get something to kill him with; and so the quick-witted Dean ran\r\noff at once to the hut, and brought a walrus tusk that we had saved.\r\nThis was driven into the hard snow not far from the hole, and, while the\r\nDean held it there firmly, I got the line made fast around it. As soon\r\nas I saw that this was secure, and that the Dean was holding on\r\nbravely, I unfastened the line from 'Old Crumply,' and, when the seal\r\ncame next time, I gave him a heavy thrust with the sharp end of it. But\r\nthis did not kill him by any means, nor did he give me another chance\r\nfor some time. Then, however, he was almost dead with bleeding, and\r\nfright, and hard struggling to get away, to say nothing of holding his\r\nbreath so long; but I wanted him too badly to have any mercy on him, so\r\nI worked away as hard as I could to get in all the line, so that the\r\nseal could not sink down through the hole any more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ingenuity is rewarded, and \"Old Crumply\" distinguished.]\r\n\r\n\"At last I was successful, and the seal was fast in the hole, and with\r\nall his struggling he could not get away. With the aid of 'Old Crumply,'\r\nI now quickly made an end of him. As soon as he was dead, we drew him\r\nout on the ice, and rejoiced over him. Such shouting never was before\r\nknown, at least in that part of the world. If anybody could have heard\r\nand seen us, we should have surely been taken up for insane people,\r\nespecially the Dean, whose joy knew no bounds.\r\n\r\n\"Having no sledge, we had to drag the dead seal over the ice and snow,\r\nfor which purpose we made the line fast through his nose. It was no easy\r\ntask to get him to the hut; and, when we did at last succeed, we found\r\nthat the seal was partly frozen, so that we were obliged to draw it\r\ninside the hut, and then thaw it, before we could get the skin off,\r\nwhich made the hut very disagreeable. After the skin and blubber were\r\nremoved, we cut off some of the flesh, and made for ourselves a good hot\r\nsupper,--first cooking a stew in our soapstone pot, and then frying some\r\nsteaks on a flat stone; and if anything was before wanting to make us\r\nperfectly happy over the capture of so great a prize, we had it now,\r\nwhen we discovered what excellent food it was, and what a quantity there\r\nwas of it.\r\n\r\n\"When we had finished butchering the seal, we prepared the skin for\r\nmaking boots; and we put the blubber and flesh away in our storehouses\r\nfor future use,--the flesh for food, and the blubber for our fire and\r\nlamp. Then we slept, and the very next day we set out to catch more\r\nseals, without, however, the same success, for we were unfortunate in\r\nevery attempt; and it was, indeed, almost a week, I think, before we\r\nmade a second capture. Some time afterward we caught a third, and then a\r\nfourth, and by great good fortune on the very same day a fifth; and not\r\nlong after that we caught another, which made the sixth.\r\n\r\n\"But it would have been well had we been content with five, without\r\ncoveting a sixth, as this last had like to have been the ruin of us; for\r\nas we were going slowly back to the hut, dragging the seal after us, and\r\nall unsuspicious of harm, we were set upon by a great white beast, the\r\nlike of which we had never seen before, but which we knew must be one of\r\nthose savage animals called polar bears. He was not coming rapidly, but\r\nwas rather crawling along cautiously, with mouth wide open, looking very\r\nfierce. As soon as we discovered him, we dropped the line with which we\r\nwere dragging the seal, and ran as fast as our legs would carry us,\r\nnever stopping until we had reached the hut and crawled into it,--not\r\nonce having had the courage to look back, for at every step we expected\r\nthat the bear would be atop of us.\r\n\r\n\"We had left 'Old Crumply' and 'Dean's Delight' where we captured the\r\nseal, intending to go for them the next day; and, having no weapon of\r\nany kind, we were in the greatest terror, expecting every moment to hear\r\nthe bear coming to tear the hut down, and drag us out, and eat us up.\r\n\r\n\"But, finding that we were not disturbed, we at length fell asleep. Upon\r\nawaking the next day, and finding that we had been suffered to go\r\nundisturbed thus long, we began to wonder whether we had not been\r\nneedlessly alarmed, and finally we set to wondering whether we had\r\nreally seen a bear after all, and at length we grew to feel quite\r\nashamed of ourselves. So we put on a little bravado, like the boy that\r\nwhistled in the dark to keep his courage up, and went out, cautiously\r\napproaching the spot where we had left the seal. Arriving there, we had\r\npositive proof enough, if any were wanting, that we had certainly seen a\r\nbear. The bones of the seal were all strewn about over the snow, picked\r\nas clean as could be. Some foxes were gnawing at them, as we came up;\r\nbut they all scampered off when they saw us coming.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrying on, we picked up 'Old Crumply' and 'Dean's Delight,' and then\r\nhastened back to the hut, which we reached without any further\r\nadventure; but on the day following, upon going out to visit our\r\nfox-traps, we came across the bear's tracks, from which it was evident\r\nto us that the wild beast was prowling round the island, where he had\r\nalready obtained one good meal, and was in hopes, no doubt, of getting\r\nanother; and, as we did not know how soon he might feel disposed to\r\nbegin upon us, we ran back to the hut with all speed, imagining, as we\r\nwent along, that every rock and snow-drift that we passed was a bear.\r\n\r\n\"We had now even greater fears than before that we should be attacked\r\nand eaten up by the wild beast. It did not once occur to us that the\r\nbear would be much more likely to prefer the contents of our storehouses\r\nto ourselves, if he came that way, but we thought only of our own\r\nsafety; and this was perhaps not unnatural, for boys and men alike are\r\neverywhere liable to magnify their own importance, even in the eyes of a\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n\"We had not been in the hut more than a couple of hours, I should say,\r\nbefore we heard the tramp of our enemy. We knew it must be the footsteps\r\nof the bear, because it could be nothing else. Our fears were now even\r\ngreater than ever.\r\n\r\n\"The bear appeared from the sound of his footsteps, crunching in the\r\nsnow, to be making directly for us, sniffing the air as he came along,\r\napparently enjoying in advance a supper that he felt quite sure of. He\r\nseemed to halt at every step or so, as if greatly relishing the\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\n\"At last he came very near, and we expected at every instant to see his\r\nhead appear at the window. Resolved to sell our lives as dearly as\r\npossible, we grasped our weapons firmly, the Dean his 'Delight' and I\r\n'Old Crumply,' to the end of which I had firmly lashed the jack-knife,\r\nafter grinding it very sharp on a stone, and giving it a good point. As\r\nthe knife-blade was quite long, I had strong hopes of giving the bear\r\nsuch a wound, when he appeared at the window, as might be the death of\r\nhim, or, at any rate, frighten him so badly that he would be glad to run\r\naway, and not come back any more.\r\n\r\n\"Nearer and nearer came the bear, and greater grew our alarm. Our hearts\r\nbeat violently in our breasts; our faces were pale as death; we held our\r\nbreath, as if fearful of making the least noise to give the bear\r\nencouragement. At length our enemy gave a sudden start. It seemed to us\r\nas if he had now made a dash at the window, so we both rose to our feet,\r\nwith our weapons ready to meet him; but, to our great joy and relief,\r\nthe sound of his footsteps showed that the beast was retreating, rather\r\nthan advancing, and was moving more rapidly. A moment afterward we heard\r\nthe rattle of stones, and now, from fear for ourselves, we passed\r\ninstantly to fear for our stores; for we knew that it was our stores,\r\nand not us, that he was after, and that he must be tearing down one of\r\nour principal storehouses. And now, what if he should tear them all\r\ndown, and eat up all our food and fuel? It was a fearful thought.\r\n\r\n\"How often do we pass almost insensibly from the greatest terror to the\r\ngreatest courage! Relieved now from all immediate personal\r\napprehension, we felt at once inspired to protect our property, on the\r\nsafety of which our lives depended. We ceased at once to feel like\r\nstanding passively on the defensive, but immediately crawled out of the\r\nhut to do something,--exactly what, we did not know. Our thoughts had,\r\nindeed, hardly time to take shape in our minds, so quickly had the\r\nchange come in the situation and in our feelings.\r\n\r\n\"The bear was plainly in sight as soon as we got outside, tearing down\r\nour storehouse; but he appeared not to be thinking of us at all. Without\r\nreflecting in the least what I was about, but filled only with alarm at\r\nthe prospect of losing our food and fuel, I set up a loud shout, in\r\nwhich the Dean joined; and, to our great surprise, the huge beast, that\r\nhad caused us so much terror, took fright himself, and without looking\r\nround, or stopping a moment, he made a great bound, and tore away over\r\nthe rocks, plunging through the snowdrifts, and rolling down the hill\r\ninto the valley, where we had dug the turf, in a most ridiculous manner.\r\n\r\n\"We passed now from a state of terror to a feeling of perfect safety,\r\nand in such an unexpected manner, too, that we laughed outright, and we\r\nthought that we had been very foolish to be so frightened, and looked\r\nupon our enemy as a great coward. So we concluded that an animal who was\r\nso easily scared as that would never attack us, and therefore, getting\r\nour weapons, we followed after him, hoping to drive him from the island.\r\nThe jumps that he had made were quite immense, showing clearly the state\r\nof his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Following the tracks of the bear, we came very soon in full view of the\r\nbeach where the carcass of the narwhal was lying, half buried in ice and\r\nsnow. The tracks led in that direction, and finally pointed straight to\r\nthe spot. He had in his flight evidently smelled the old narwhal, and,\r\nremembering only that he was hungry, had stopped there; for presently we\r\ncaught sight of him, tearing away at the narwhal with as much energy as\r\nhe had before wasted upon our storehouse.\r\n\r\n\"We had come quite near to the bear before we saw him; and now our\r\nspirits underwent another sudden change, and our minds were once more\r\nfilled with such feelings of respect for the bear, that we turned about\r\nimmediately, and beat a hasty retreat; and, when once more under the\r\nshelter of the hut, prepared again to stand on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\"All we could now do was to watch the bear closely. So long as the old\r\nnarwhal lasted, we felt that we were safe enough, even after he had\r\napparently satisfied himself with a good meal, and had gone away, as\r\nseemed likely, to sleep. He would certainly, however, come back to the\r\nnarwhal again when he got hungry; but now, worse than ever, when he did\r\ncome back, there were two other bears with him, and all three of them\r\nwere making a meal off the carcass of the dead narwhal. These last two\r\nwere quite small ones,--the smaller not being larger than a big\r\nNewfoundland dog.\r\n\r\n\"With this discovery all our newly found courage took rapid flight, and\r\nwe were overtaken with even greater alarm than before. That the narwhal\r\nwould soon all be gone seemed plain enough, with three bears feeding\r\nupon it; and then, when this feeding was over, this first bear, knowing\r\nwhere our storehouse was, and forgetting his fright, and having two\r\nbears, and perhaps by that time even more, to help him, we were sure he\r\nwould soon come back again. It seemed as if a great crisis had now come\r\nin our fortunes, and what to do we did not know, and what was to become\r\nof us we could not imagine. We were in great trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder,\" exclaimed William,--\"the horrid brutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been scared to death,\" cried Fred; while little Alice\r\nthought it was too dreadful to think of; but, \"The poor bears, how cold\r\nand hungry they must have been!\" said she.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nShows, Among Other Curious Matters, That Two Boys Are\r\nBetter Than One, and That Pluck Is a Good Thing,\r\nEspecially When Polar Bears Are Around.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next record we have of the doings of the ancient mariner and his\r\nlittle friends reads thus:--\r\n\r\n\"You will tell us to-day what you did with the bears,--won't you,\r\nCaptain Hardy?\" inquired William.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the Captain, laughing in his free-and-easy way, like a\r\njolly old sailor as he was, taking his long pipe out of his mouth that\r\nhe might do it all the better, \"I think it was pretty near being what\r\nthe bears did with us, my hearties! yes, that would be quite as near the\r\nmark, I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter, then,\" said William,--\"no matter, Captain Hardy; we ain't\r\nparticular,--any way you like. I'll put the question t' other way,\r\nthen,--what did the bears do with you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain was in great good-humor to-day, and he kept on laughing till\r\nhis pipe went out; and, while he laughed, he said, \"Why, to be sure,\r\nthey frightened us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tit for tat,\" exclaimed William; \"you frightened them,--that's fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" replied the Captain,--\"that's so, sure enough; only they\r\nwouldn't stay frightened, while we did, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! did they find you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"That they did, my lad, just as soon as they had finished the old\r\nnarwhal. We were sound asleep when they came; and they soon woke us up\r\nwith the great noise they made close to the hut.\r\n\r\n\"But stop a bit!\" exclaimed the Captain, reflectively; \"my story's got\r\nahead of me, or I've got ahead of the story,--one or the other; so I\r\nmust go back a little,\"--and he paused, not with his finger to his nose\r\nthis time, as usual, but to his forehead, as if feeling in his brain for\r\nthe end of the \"yarn,\" as he always called the story.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the old man appeared to have quite satisfied himself about\r\nthe matter, for he started off as fast as he could go:--\r\n\r\n\"I didn't tell you anything about the fort we built, nor the time we had\r\nprovisioning it,--did I?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered William, \"nothing about a fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there's the broken end of the yarn at last,\" and the old man took\r\nhis finger from his forehead and stopped feeling for it.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was a good long time,\" continued the Captain, \"before the\r\nbears finished the old narwhal; but, finding how much they were occupied\r\nin that quarter, we went to our storehouses, and brought all our stores\r\naway, and stowed them close to the mouth of the hut, thinking that, if\r\nthey were discovered, we should there be better able to protect them.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, however, we built up two solid snow-walls, about three\r\nfeet apart, and as high as our heads, directly on a line with the\r\nentrance to our hut, so that when we went outside we walked right\r\nbetween them. Then, behind these walls, we piled all the birds,\r\nseal-flesh and eggs that we had for food, and all the blubber (now\r\nfrozen quite hard) that we had for fuel,--the former on the right-hand\r\nside (going out), and the latter on the left. Having done this, we\r\ncovered the whole over with snow several feet deep; and, as a still\r\nfurther protection against our enemies the bears, we built up a great\r\nwall all around in front of the hut where there were no high rocks.\r\nThrough this wall we left only one small hole to crawl through when we\r\nwent out; and, when we came inside, we carefully closed it up with some\r\nlarge blocks of snow. But we did not go outside much, being afraid; and\r\nat length, when one of the bears was discovered prowling about very near\r\nthe hut, we drew within our fortification, closed the opening in the\r\nwall as tightly as possible, and were prepared for a siege.\r\n\r\n\"At first we did not sleep much, being all the time fearful of attack;\r\nbut gaining courage as we found, day after day, that the bears did not\r\ncome to molest us, we at length fell asleep both together; and it was\r\nwhile we were thus asleep that the bears discovered us. Before either of\r\nus awoke, they had actually scaled the wall of our snow-fort, and\r\nadvanced to where our food and fuel were stowed, close to the mouth of\r\nthe hut, and were tearing through the snow to get at it.\r\n\r\n\"We were, naturally enough, much alarmed, not so much on our own\r\nimmediate account, as on account of our stores, for the bears would, we\r\nknew very well, not be likely to trouble us so long as there was\r\nanything else to eat; but then they might just as well eat us first, and\r\nthe stores afterward, as to eat the stores first; for then we must\r\nsurely starve and freeze, which would be quite as bad.\r\n\r\n\"Fully sensible of our unhappy condition, and the first feeling of alarm\r\nhaving passed over, we began seriously to speculate upon what we should\r\ndo; for something had to be done, and that very quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I looked out through the window, and there were the bears all crowded\r\ntogether in the narrow passage; and one of them had already got among\r\nthe frozen ducks, which were tumbling in the snow about his feet, and he\r\nhad one in his mouth, crunching away at it in such a manner as to leave\r\nno doubt that he was either very hungry or was in a violent hurry;\r\ngrowling all the while,--'Ung, ung, ung,'--with each crunch he gave, to\r\nkeep away the other two bears. This bear was much the largest of the\r\nthree; the smallest one was not, as I said before, larger than a\r\nNewfoundland dog,--not larger than Port or Starboard. Thus you see not\r\nonly what a destructive, but what a selfish, beast he was.\r\n\r\n\"From alarm we now got to be angry, as we observed the liberties these\r\nbears were taking with our food, and the little ceremony they made of\r\neating up, in this wholesale manner, what had cost us so much hard labor\r\nto get, and upon which our very lives now depended.\r\n\r\n\"I seized 'Old Crumply' in very desperation, and asked the Dean if he\r\nwould follow me. 'What!' exclaimed he, 'you don't mean to attack them?'\r\n'That's just what I am going to do,' said I; 'and, if you can do\r\nanything with \"The Delight,\" now's your chance.' 'I'll stand by you,'\r\nsaid the Dean, grasping his weapon; 'better to be killed outright by the\r\nbears than to let them starve us to death, and then very likely kill us\r\nafterwards.'\r\n\r\n\"Desperate as was our condition, I could not help being amused by the\r\nDean's way of putting the matter,--'first starved to death, and then\r\nkilled'; and I think this little speech, turned in that happy way, did a\r\ngreat deal to stiffen up my courage.\r\n\r\n\"I crawled out through the doorway of the hut (which I have told you\r\nwas not high enough for us to stand upright in), and, upon coming near\r\nthe end of it, there was the bear within three feet of me. His head was\r\nturned away, and his nose was all buried up in the snow; for he had just\r\nswallowed a duck, and was getting a fresh one, so that he did not see\r\nme. My heart seemed to be in my mouth,--so close to the dreadful\r\nmonster,--so ferocious and fearful did he appear as I looked up at him.\r\nHad I been alone, I think I should have retreated; but here was the Dean\r\nbehind me, and I was ashamed to back out, having gone thus far.\r\nSummoning all my courage, therefore, I brought forward my spear, grasped\r\nit with both hands, and plunged it with all my force into the animal's\r\nneck, just behind the lower jaw and below the ear.\r\n\r\n\"It was a fortunate stroke. I had evidently, by chance, cut some great\r\nblood-vessel, for the blood spouted from the wound in a regular stream.\r\nThe bear dropped his duck very quickly, I can tell you. He was probably\r\nnever so much astonished in all his life before. I had come upon him so\r\nstealthily, and he was so absorbed in what he was about, that he had\r\nnever once suspected the presence of an enemy, but thought himself, no\r\ndoubt, a very lucky bear to find such a dinner ready caught for him, and\r\nwas quite as little concerned about who the owner might be as most\r\npeople would be if they found a bag of gold.\r\n\r\n\"But I caused him to sing another tune than to be constantly going 'Ung,\r\nung, ung,' to frighten off the little bears, for he roared with terror,\r\nso that you might have heard him half a mile; and, finding that he could\r\nnot wheel around as quickly as he wanted to, he roared again, louder\r\nthan before, which sounded so dreadful that I drew back into the hut\r\nquite instinctively, and thus lost the opportunity to give him another\r\nthrust, which I might very well have done, in the side. When he had got\r\nwheeled round, he rolled over the other two bears, and the three\r\ntogether, all roaring in a dreadful way, rolled against the snow-wall of\r\nour fort, and broke it down; and now, as soon as they could scramble to\r\ntheir legs again, they hurried away through the snow down into the\r\nvalley,--the smallest one trying hard to keep up, and whining piteously\r\nall the while, as if he were afraid something terrible was coming to\r\ncatch him; and now, just as we had done before, when we had, with our\r\nshouts, frightened the bears away when they had first come to disturb\r\nus, we ran after them, little thinking of danger, in the excitement of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\"We found that the bear I had wounded held straight down the valley, as\r\nwas easily told by the red streak he left behind him on the snow. The\r\nother two turned to the right, and ran over in the direction of the old\r\nnarwhal.\r\n\r\n\"Following the red streak, we came soon down to the beach; and then\r\nclimbing over the rough ice which the tide had piled up, we were quickly\r\nupon the frozen sea, hurrying on as fast as we could go. Indeed, no\r\nfeeling of fear ever crossed our minds; for the great quantity of blood\r\nthat the bear left behind him somehow or other went to convince us,\r\nwithout much reflection, that the bear must be dead, and that we should\r\npresently come upon him.\r\n\r\n\"While hurrying on at this rate, our spirits received as sudden a check\r\nas they had on a previous occasion; for we did at length come upon the\r\nbear, sure enough, and, forgetting all our courage immediately, we\r\nwheeled about in great alarm, and ran back towards the hut as fast as we\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\n\"Finding, however, that we were not pursued, we turned about again; and,\r\nproceeding more cautiously this time, we came, in a little while, in\r\nsight of the bear again, very near where he was before; but now he was\r\nclearly by no means a formidable enemy; for he was going along very\r\nslowly, and making a crooked track, as if he was drunk. Directly he fell\r\nover; and, in a little while afterwards, we went up to him, and found\r\nhim dead,--having bled to death from the wound I had given him.\r\n\r\n\"You may easily imagine how rejoiced we were; for now we had an enormous\r\nsupply of food, and a fine bear-skin besides; so I lost no time in\r\nunlashing the knife-blade from the end of 'Old Crumply,' and with this\r\nwe began to butcher him. It was a very cold and tedious operation; but\r\nwe got through with it at last, and then, burying all of the flesh in\r\nthe snow except a small piece that we wanted for supper, we returned to\r\nthe hut, dragging the skin after us, the Dean whistling, all the way,\r\n'Bonaparte crossing the Alps,' which he had picked up, as he told me,\r\nfrom a Frenchman in Havana.\r\n\r\n\"While we were coming up the valley towards the hut, in this lively\r\nstate of mind, the Dean stopped suddenly, and said: 'Suppose, Hardy, the\r\nother two bears have taken a notion to come back'; and he was right; for\r\nwe came presently in sight of one of them, very near the hut, and making\r\ndirectly for it. As soon as he saw us, however, he ran away. So we took\r\na good laugh at his expense, and, thinking the other one must be near\r\nhim, though not in sight, we proceeded on our way. Fortunately, however,\r\nbefore seeing the bear, we halted long enough to secure the knife-blade\r\nagain on the end of 'Old Crumply'; and it was well that we did this,\r\nfor, when we arrived at the broken wall where the bears had made their\r\nway out, much to our surprise, we came right upon the other bear, close\r\nup to the mouth of the hut, busy swallowing a duck. This was the\r\nsmallest of the three bears, and he could not have been more than a\r\nyear or so old. No sooner did he hear us than he, like the other one,\r\nbecame alarmed; but, seeing us in the road by which he had entered, he\r\ndid not try to escape in that way, nor did he appear to have the least\r\nidea that he had only to charge upon us to see how quickly he would\r\nclear the passage; for, instead of doing this, he instantly rushed\r\nforward, and plunged into our hut, no doubt thinking that would lead to\r\na place of safety.\r\n\r\n\"I do not exactly know by what motive I was impelled, but I suppose the\r\nsame that governed me on several other occasions; that is, a general one\r\nbelonging to almost all human beings, and, indeed, to most animals, that\r\nis, to chase whatever runs away, and to run away from whatever chases.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I rushed up to the doorway of the hut, I believe without\r\nany idea at all in my head, and without giving much thought about it,\r\nand had like to have got into a great scrape; for the bear, having found\r\nthat the hut gave him no chance of escape, had turned about, and was\r\ncoming out again. I was wholly unprepared for him, so hasty had I been.\r\nI could not run, and therefore, quite mechanically, I hit him in the\r\nface with the sharp point of 'Old Crumply,' which sent him back into the\r\nhut again, and made him roar in an awful manner, as if he were half\r\nkilled. I knew I must have hit him on some tender spot,--the eye, it\r\nproved to be afterwards, so he was half blind as well as half dead.\r\n\r\n\"It was very unfortunate that I had not let him go, or killed him\r\noutright; for we could now hear him tearing everything to pieces in our\r\nhut, trying to find a place of escape. The wall between our\r\nsleeping-place and our closet was first knocked over, as he scrambled\r\nabout; and there was no doubt that our pots and lamps were all broken to\r\npieces. It was like a great roaring bull in a china shop, and we wished\r\nmany times that he was only out and off; and, if he had only known, our\r\nminds upon the subject, a compromise would have been speedily made, and\r\nthe beast might have gone scot-free on condition of his doing no further\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\n\"The bear was not long in discovering the window. Now, the window being\r\nvery small, it was evident that, if he attempted it, he would do us a\r\ngreat damage, for he could only pass through by knocking down some part\r\nof the wall. No sooner, therefore, had his head appeared in that\r\nquarter, than the Dean charged him most gallantly with the 'Delight,'\r\nand gave him such a tremendous blow on the nose that he was glad enough\r\nto draw his head in again, which he did with a great cry. Then he became\r\nquiet for a while, as if meditating what course it was best for him now\r\nto pursue.\r\n\r\n\"Availing myself of this little pause, I exchanged weapons with the\r\nDean, and, fixing the harpoon-head on the end of the 'Delight,' I tied\r\nthe other end of the line which was fast to it around a large stone that\r\nlay across the doorway of the hut. This I did because I thought there\r\nmight be a possible chance of catching the bear; and that, if we could\r\nonly get him to run out, I might harpoon him as he passed, and the stone\r\nwould hold him until we could find some way of despatching him.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner had these preparations been made than the bear was again in\r\nmotion; and now he gave a roar that seemed loud enough to have rattled\r\nthe whole hut down about his ears. This time he had clearly tried the\r\nchimney, and had not only scattered the burning moss and fat all about\r\nthe hut, but had set himself on fire into the bargain; for a great\r\nvolume of smoke came out through the window, which smelled of burning\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\"The screams of the bear were now pitiful to hear, and in very\r\ndesperation he once more tried the window, when the Dean quickly gave\r\nhim a crack with 'Old Crumply,' which sent him back again.\r\n\r\n\"Grown now utterly reckless, he bolted right through the door. I was\r\nready for him, standing on the top of the passageway and on the stone to\r\nwhich the harpoon line was made fast. As the bear came under me, I let\r\ndrive with the harpoon, and stuck him in the back. And then away he\r\ndashed like a fiery demon, plunging through the snow, smoking and\r\nblazing all over. He had evidently rolled all about in our burning fat\r\nand moss, as bits of burning moss were sticking to him, setting his hair\r\nall on fire, and no doubt scorching his skin to a degree that must have\r\nmade a dive into the snow very comfortable indeed.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he had run out all the line, the stone under my feet,\r\ninstead of holding fast, gave way, pitching me after the bear, and\r\nturning me quite upside down. I landed head-foremost in a snow-bank. The\r\nburning bear went rushing and roaring away, dragging the big stone after\r\nhim; but not far, however, for he fell over and died directly,--no doubt\r\npartly from fright, but chiefly, perhaps, from his wounds and his severe\r\nburns.\r\n\r\n\"Having got rid of the bear, we gave him no further thought for the\r\npresent, but rushed into the hut to see what mischief he had done there.\r\nThe smoke was at first so thick that we were almost smothered by it. Our\r\ncloth coats and part of our fur bedding were all mixed up with the\r\nburning moss upon the floor, and were being rapidly destroyed. As we had\r\nfeared, the pots and lamps were all broken; and, in short, the inside of\r\nthe hut was in a most sorry state.\r\n\r\n\"It was a long time before we fully repaired all the damage the bear had\r\ndone, and we suffered much inconvenience and discomfort before we\r\nreplaced our pots, cups, and lamps. When we had, however, at last done\r\nall this, we were not sorry that the bears had come to disturb us, but\r\non the other hand were rather rejoiced; for we were now in all respects\r\njust as comfortable as ever, and had besides a great warm bear-skin to\r\nsleep on, and one more variety of food added to our list, and that, too,\r\nin such large quantity that there was no fear of our coming to want very\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeeing that the ancient mariner showed signs of breaking off at this\r\nstage of the story, Fred spoke up, and wanted to know more about the\r\nbear that had set fire to himself.\r\n\r\n\"O, it don't much matter about him,\" replied the Captain. \"When we had\r\nlooked after the hut, and had got the fire put out, and found leisure\r\nthen to go after the bear, he was dead enough, as I said before; but\r\nmuch of the hair was singed off him as nicely almost, in some places, as\r\nif he had been shaved, so that the skin was of little use to us, and we\r\nonly used the flesh, which we soon grew very fond of; for this bear, as\r\nI have said before, was a young one, and his flesh was tender.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of the other bear?\" asked William, curious to reach the end\r\nof the bear story.\r\n\r\n\"We never saw anything more of him, nor heard anything more of him\r\neither,\" answered the Captain; \"and indeed we were never troubled any\r\nmore with bears at all in that way, but thereafter lived in peace.\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, we lived in peace so far as the bears were concerned;\r\nbut the cold and the darkness were now at their greatest, and the winds\r\nblew sometimes with such violence that we were often greatly terrified.\r\nIndeed, the storms at one time were so constant and so fearful that we\r\ncould scarcely stir out of doors. Up to this period the weather had been\r\nmostly calm and very favorable to our course of life; but, as the winter\r\nbegan to turn towards the spring, all this was changed.\r\n\r\n\"Yet we could not but feel thankful for the great privilege of good\r\nweather with which Providence had so far blessed us. Had the storms\r\nraged in the autumn and early winter as they did now, we should have\r\nbeen quite unable to provide for our wants, and we must have starved.\r\nBut now our needs were abundantly supplied, and we had little occasion\r\nfor going abroad unless we wanted to and the weather was favorable. Once\r\nonly did we experience any serious danger from the weather; and this,\r\nlike most evils that befall all human beings, was due to our own\r\nimprudence.\r\n\r\n\"There being a bright moon, and the air being nearly calm and not\r\nunusually cold, we were tempted to take a long walk; and, attracted by\r\none object after another that was upon the frozen sea over which we were\r\nwalking,--here an iceberg of peculiar formation or remarkable size,\r\nthere a snow-drift of singular form,--we found ourselves at last several\r\nmiles away from our hut.\r\n\r\n\"When we turned about at length to retrace our steps, we discovered that\r\nthe northern sky, which we now faced (for we had walked out in a\r\nsoutherly direction), showed stormy symptoms, and very quickly afterward\r\na severe gale of wind broke over the island and the desolate sea, and we\r\nfound ourselves overwhelmed with drifting snow.\r\n\r\n\"The sky was for the most part cloudless, and no snow fell from the\r\nheavens, but the light snow that lay upon the ice was picked up, as it\r\nwere, by the wind, and whirled through the air in a manner as beautiful\r\nas it was terrible; for the drift coming in streams, with the rushing\r\nwind, lashed our faces, torturing us in a terrible manner, chilling us\r\nthrough and through, and almost overpowering us. Then an aurora borealis\r\nburst out before us, as if the heavens were on fire,--and from the top\r\nof our little island the snow came whirling above our heads in constant\r\nstreams, that went circling about in a most fantastic way.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot imagine how grand this storm scene was,--the wind howling\r\naround us, the snowdrifts whirling about and spinning over the icy\r\nplain, the moon gleaming brightly upon the snow and the icebergs and the\r\nisland, and every now and then a great blaze of many colors that were\r\nreflected on everything about us, would start up from the auroral arch,\r\nuntil the light became almost as great for a few moments as if it were\r\nbroad day. It was very fearful, and you may be sure that we hastened on\r\nto the hut as fast as we could, though we were not in such a great hurry\r\nas to be wholly insensible to the magnificence of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"After we had reached the hut, the Dean repeated some verses which he\r\nhad picked up somewhere; and when I recite them for you, you will see\r\nhow appropriate they were to what I have been describing, and how\r\nstrange seemed to us our situation when we found ourselves in the very\r\nplace where the poet had imagined the Northwest wind to have a\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n    \"The Nor'west wind is a spirit brave,\r\n      And he cometh from afar;\r\n    He is cradled far down in the depths that yawn\r\n      Beneath the polar star.\r\n\r\n    \"Where no mortal foot hath been, he maketh\r\n      His track o'er the snowy plain;\r\n    And listens the tread of phantoms dread,\r\n      With banner and spear and flame.\r\n\r\n    \"Where the billows are booming on frozen shore,\r\n      O there right kingly is he!\r\n    His pinnacled throne the iceberg lone,\r\n      His empire the boundless sea.\r\n\r\n    \"He rideth aloft on the mountain-tops,--\r\n      Rare sport doth he meet with there;\r\n    He spinneth the snow in lightning flow,\r\n      Till it gleams like a witch's hair.\"\r\n\r\n    \"O the Nor'west wind is a spirit brave,\r\n      A conquering hero is he;\r\n    And his fierce battle song, as he marcheth along,\r\n      Is the shout of victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, how beautiful and appropriate!\" exclaimed the children.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said William, \"how did you get to the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without any other accident,\" replied the Captain, \"than with two frozen\r\nnoses, which were sore for a long time afterwards. But, after it was all\r\nover, we would not have missed the sight for anything, it was so grand;\r\nyet, had we been caught out on the sea a little farther from the hut, we\r\nshould never have got back, but both of us must have perished.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see how Providence continued to watch over the two poor\r\ncastaways.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCovers a Long Period of Time, and shows, among other\r\nThings, how a Race may be lost at Both Ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I must now tell you,\" continued the Captain, \"that, while all these\r\nadventures were happening, the winter was passing steadily away; and,\r\nfrom what I have before told you about the Arctic seasons, you will know\r\nthat when the winter came finally to an end the darkness came to an end\r\ntoo,--that is, to be more particular, first there was a little flush of\r\nlight at noon, to see which made us very glad, you may be sure; after\r\nthis, from day to day, the light grew brighter and brighter, until it\r\nwas almost broad daylight, as it is here just before the sun has risen\r\nin the morning; then the sun came up a few days afterward only a little\r\nway above the horizon (of course right in the south); and then, next\r\nday, it was a little higher, and the next day a little higher still; and\r\nthen, by and by, it was (as it had been in the summer-time before)\r\ncircling round and round us, shining all the while; and now our hut was\r\nat midnight in the shadow of the cliff; at noon the sun was blazing down\r\nupon us, softening the snow, and making our hearts, O, how happy and\r\nthankful!--more so than I can tell you.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that never in all my life had I seen anything so splendid as\r\nthe sun's bright face when he appeared for the first time after this\r\nlong dark winter. For you must know we were about one hundred and twenty\r\ndays without once setting eyes upon the sun at all; and now, when he did\r\nrise, after this long interval, what could we do but take off our caps\r\nand whirl them round and round our heads, in very joy and gladness? and\r\nthis I can assure you we did with many a good round cheer.\r\n\r\n\"The summer now came on steadily, and the temperature became warmer\r\nevery day. The spring glided into summer, and early in the month of June\r\nthe snow began to melt in good earnest, and by July great streams were\r\ndashing and roaring over the cliffs, and through the gorges, to the sea.\r\nThen the sea soon began to show the influence of the summer heat. The\r\nice grew rotten, and, from being white, it got to be quite dark; and we\r\ncould no longer go out upon it with any safety, except in one particular\r\ndirection, towards the east, where it was much thicker than in any other\r\nplace. Then strong winds came, and the rotten ice was broken up, and\r\nafter that it went drifting here and there to right and left, up and\r\ndown upon the sea, whichever way the winds were blowing.\r\n\r\n\"And now once more we kept a sharp lookout for ships, hoping all the\r\ntime that 'this day will be the day of our deliverance.' But we lived on\r\nas we had done before,--every day adding one more disappointment to the\r\nlist,--for no ship came. Thus watching, waiting, hoping on, we grew\r\nrestless with anxiety, and were more unhappy than we had ever been in\r\nthe gloomy winter that had passed away.\r\n\r\n\"But the summer brought some pleasure to us. As soon as the snow had\r\ngone, the grass grew green upon the hillside, and the tiny little plants\r\nput out their leaves, and then the tiny little flowers were blooming\r\nbrightly, and turning up their pleasant faces to the ever-smiling sun.\r\n\r\n\"And then the birds came back,--the eider-ducks, and the little auks,\r\nthat I have told you of, and great flocks of geese and gulls, all\r\nlooking out for places in which to make their nests; and they fairly\r\nkept the air alive with the flutter of their wings, and their 'quack,\r\nquack, quack,' and their gladsome screams, as they hurried to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"And then bright yellow butterflies and little bees came fluttering and\r\nbuzzing about the little flowers, and all was life and happiness and\r\nbrightness in the air about us; but there was no one there to look at us\r\nand see how heavy were our hearts at times,--no one but God.\r\n\r\n\"But not on our desert island alone was nature full of life and gayety.\r\nThe seals, as if glad that summer had once more returned, crawled out\r\nupon the ice, and lay there on it, where it floated in the water,\r\nbasking in the sun. There were hundreds and hundreds of them to be seen\r\nalmost every day; and, besides the seals, the walruses, with their great\r\nlong hideous-looking tusks and ugly and ungraceful bodies, came up too;\r\nand the narwhals, also, with their long ivory horns, and the white\r\nwhales, were to be seen at almost any time, 'spouting' round about us in\r\nthe sea. And besides all this life in the sea, and in the air, and on\r\nthe land, we now and then saw a great white bear prowling about upon the\r\nfloating ice-fields, seeking seals to feed upon; and, when tired of one\r\nice-field, he would jump into the water, and swim away and crawl up on\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you observe that, if we were upon a desert island in the Arctic\r\nSea, it was not so barren as one would think who had never seen anything\r\nof such a place.\r\n\r\n\"It is not worth while for me to tell you how we lived through this\r\nsecond summer. Of course we had a much easier time of it than we had had\r\nthe summer previous, for there was no hut to build, and we had now\r\nleisure to make ourselves more comfortable; and indeed we used our time\r\nso well that we accumulated, in good season, everything we needed in the\r\nway of food and fuel,--catching the birds and other animals as before,\r\nwhich we stowed away in so many different places that we felt quite sure\r\nthe bears would not be likely to discover all of them; and then we made\r\nfresh suits of fine fur clothes, and fresh fur bedding, and carved new\r\nlamps and pots and cups out of soapstone, that we might be safe against\r\nall accidents.\r\n\r\n\"While we were thus working, and watching all the time for ships,\r\nwithout the hoped-for ship ever coming, the summer passed away, the\r\nbirds flew off once more with the setting sun, the sea froze up all\r\naround the island, and we were left again alone,--all, all alone, in the\r\ncold and snow and darkness of another winter.\r\n\r\n\"O how heavy were our hearts now! Bright had been our hopes of rescue;\r\ngreat was our disappointment, and unhappy the prospect before us. For a\r\ntime we were very despondent; but the darkest hour, you know, is just\r\nbefore the break of day, and we were experiencing now only one more of\r\nour many periods of gloom with daybreak following; for when the winter\r\nfairly sealed up the sea around us, and covered everything with snow, we\r\nfelt the same spirit of resignation in our lives that had before carried\r\nus through so many trials and difficulties. And in this we were a great\r\nsupport to each other. If our hearts were more than commonly heavy at\r\nany time, we tried all we could to disguise it from each other, and\r\ntried always to be as cheerful as possible. If we had each always\r\ncarried a gloomy face about with him, I am sure both of us must have\r\ndied. Thus you see how important is the spirit of cheerfulness; and, to\r\ntell the truth, I haven't much opinion of long-faced people anyway,\r\nwhether they live on rocky islands or in big houses or in little\r\nhuts,--whether they are old or young, rich or poor, civilized or savage,\r\nChristian or pagan. That's my opinion.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, this winter passed over just as the other had done;--the same\r\nroutine of work and hunting, the same cold and darkness, the same\r\nconstant bearing up against our unhappy fortunes. It did not in any\r\nparticular differ from the other in a manner worthy of mention, except\r\nthat no bears came this time to disturb us. But there was the same\r\naurora borealis, the same bright starlight and brighter moonlight, the\r\nsame fierce snows and howling gales. We caught foxes and seals as we had\r\ndone before, and wanted not for food or fuel. Our health was still\r\nalways good.\r\n\r\n\"So you see there is no occasion for our halting over this period. I can\r\ntell you nothing new about it. The winter came to an end, as everything\r\nmust, in time; the sun came back; the summer followed the winter; and\r\nthis, our third summer on the Rock of Good Hope, passed away like the\r\nothers, with its bright sunshine, and its pretty butterflies and\r\nflowers, and myriads of birds, but still no ship, and still no rescue.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the Captain had thus spoken, he paused as if to consider whether\r\nhe had omitted anything, in connection with the long period they had\r\npassed on the island, that would make it worth his while to dwell\r\nlonger upon any portion of his story up to this time. Satisfied always\r\nof the deep interest and close attention of his young auditors, he\r\nthought only of selecting such points of the narrative as seemed to him\r\nlikely to convey most pleasure and instruction to the little people,\r\nwho, ever eager to listen, were yet always curious to have something\r\ncleared up which the Captain had hastily passed over, thinking little of\r\nit. But still they had the good sense to see (to say nothing of the\r\nrequirements of politeness) that they were not likely to be much\r\nbenefited by interrupting the Captain; for if they asked questions in\r\nthe midst of his story he would, in all probability, be put out, and\r\nlose the even thread of his narration. But a question, or perhaps a\r\nvolley of them, was always sure to come if the Captain made a pause, or\r\nas he, in mariner phrase, expressed it, lay \"hove to,\" for a little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nSo it was now. No sooner had the Captain stopped his speech, and got\r\ninto the reflective mood, than William's tongue was loosened.\r\n\r\n\"O Captain Hardy!\" said he, \"don't go on until you have told us\r\nsomething more about those curious little flowers you have been speaking\r\nof. It is so odd to think of flowers growing in such a desert place!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, do!\" exclaimed little Alice, \"O, do, do, Captain Hardy! they must be\r\nsuch pretty little things! But I don't see how they ever get any chance\r\nto grow, when it is so cold and dreary. How do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty they are indeed, my dear,\" replied the kind-hearted Captain,\r\npleased to have the question asked, as was evident, \"and very wonderful.\r\nHow they managed to grow is more than I can tell, and is just as\r\nastonishing to me as to yourselves. The snow, however, in the spring\r\nwent pretty quickly; and as soon as the earth was free in any place,\r\nthen we saw the tiniest flowers you ever saw coming up, seemingly right\r\nout of the frozen earth, and almost underneath the very snow,--at least\r\nwithin a few inches of it. The Dean and I one day came across one of\r\nthese little flowers, looking just like a buttercup, only the whole\r\nplant was--well, the littlest thing you ever did see. Why, it was so\r\nlittle that little Alice's little thimble, with which she is learning to\r\nsew so prettily, would have been quite large enough for a flower-pot to\r\nput the whole of it in! and it would have grown there, too,--and glad\r\nenough, no doubt. There was a great snow-bank hanging right over it, and\r\nthere was ice all around it. But still it looked spunky, and happy, and\r\nwell contented, and seemed quite able to take care of itself.\r\n\r\n\"As we walked on towards the hut, I noticed that the Dean grew very\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the matter, Dean?' said I; 'what are you thinking about?'\r\n\r\n\"'About that little flower,' replied the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"At this I laughed, asking the Dean what there was in the little flower\r\nto think about.\r\n\r\n\"'A great deal,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"I laughed again, and asked him what it was.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' said he, very soberly, 'it is a lesson to us not to get the\r\nblues any more. If that poor flower can live and fight its way against\r\nsuch odds, I think we ought to!'\r\n\r\n\"Now there was more in that observation of the thoughtful little Dean\r\nthan you would think for; and we talked a great deal about the little\r\nflower,--indeed, it came up between us very often; we went back many\r\ntimes to it, and watched it closely. Once there came a snow-storm and\r\nburied it up; but next day the snow was all melted, and the leaves came\r\nout as green, and the flower as yellow, and the whole plant as plucky,\r\nas ever. I should say the flower was about as large round as a very\r\nsmall pea, and it was just as yellow as gold; and the whole wee thing\r\nwas not taller than a common-sized pin.\r\n\r\n\"We talked so much about this little flower that we got to making rhymes\r\nabout it; and, every time we made a new rhyme, we were much delighted,\r\nyou may be sure. How we wished we had some way to write down what we\r\nthought! It would have been much easier, and a great satisfaction. But,\r\nfor all that, we finally got quite a song of it, which I have not\r\nforgotten, even to this time. To be sure we did not know much about\r\nmaking verses, and nothing at all about what they call 'feet' in poetry;\r\nyet we got some pretty good rhymes for all, though they might be called\r\na little worm-fency, or like as if they hadn't got their sea-legs on,\r\nyou know. Now, would you like to hear this little song that the Dean and\r\nI made about the little Arctic flower?\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, yes, dear Captain Hardy!--yes, yes, indeed!\" said the children,\r\nin such a loud and universal chorus that nobody could have told who\r\n\"deared\" the Captain, or who said \"O,\" or who, \"indeed\"; but you may be\r\nsure they all said \"yes!\" and so the Captain, being thus encouraged,\r\ncleared his throat, and said he would repeat it.\r\n\r\n\"My impression is,\" he continued, \"that it isn't exactly a song; in\r\nfact, I don't know what it is. I should hardly venture on calling it a\r\n'poem,' you see; but still, for all that, we must give it a name, you\r\nknow, and 'song,' 'poem,' or what not, its right title anyhow is:--\r\n\r\n           THE ARCTIC FLOWER.\r\n\r\n    O tiny, tiny Arctic flower\r\n      Where have you kept yourself so long?\r\n    Deep buried in a snowy bower?\r\n      And did the winter treat you wrong?\r\n      You little, smiling, gladsome thing!\r\n      You pretty, pretty flower of spring!\r\n      You little, little, wee, wee thing!\r\n    So bright, so cheery in the sun,\r\n    So everything that every one\r\n      Would wish a flower to bring.\r\n      You tiny, tiny little thing!\r\n    I'm so afraid the frosts will nip\r\n      Your little feet, you tenderling,\r\n      You crazy, crazy little thing!\r\n    What e'er possessed you to come up\r\n      And nestle there beside the snow,\r\n      As if you'd warm it with a glow\r\n    Of golden light from your bright face,\r\n    On which there is no single trace\r\n      Of anything like sorrow?\r\n    Cheery, cheery, always cheery,\r\n    Always cheery, never weary,\r\n      E'en with frozen sod close bound,\r\n      E'en with snow all piled around,\r\n      E'en with the frosts upon the ground,\r\n    Your little tender roots to chill!\r\n    O, what a royal little will\r\n      You have, you little gladsome thing,\r\n      You pretty, pretty flower of spring,\r\n    You little, little weesome mite,\r\n    You tiny, tiny little sprite!\r\n      E'en now the snows are at your feet,\r\n    And piled a hundred times your height,\r\n      Close, close beside your face so sweet!\r\n    And yet you smile, you pretty thing,\r\n    You pretty, pretty flower of spring,\r\n    You little, little, wee, wee thing!\r\n      And do not seem to care a bit,\r\n      And look as happy, every whit,\r\n    As any other flower of spring.\r\n    And what a lesson, too, you bring\r\n    To all of us, you little thing!\r\n      You show us how to persevere,\r\n      You show us how a happy cheer\r\n      May always on the face appear,\r\n      If God we trust and God we fear;\r\n      For God is every, every where,\r\n      And this the flower doth declare,--\r\n    The tiny, tiny little flower,\r\n    The weesome, weesome little flower,\r\n      The little, smiling, gladsome thing,\r\n      The pretty, pretty flower of spring,\r\n      The little, little, wee, wee thing.\r\n\r\n\"There, now you have it!\" exclaimed the Captain, drawing a very long\r\nbreath, and looking around, no doubt to see the impression he had\r\nproduced,--\"there you have it, my dears!\"\r\n\r\nThe children all expressed themselves highly delighted with this effort\r\nof the Captain's in the poetical way, and they all declared if that\r\nwasn't a song they \"would like to see one.\"\r\n\r\nThus greatly flattered by the pleasure the children received from his\r\nrecitation of what had become old to him, and deeply rooted in his\r\nmemory, the Captain resumed once more the thread of his narrative, or,\r\nrather, \"once more picked up the broken yarn, and spun away,\" as he\r\nwould have more graphically expressed it.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" continued the Captain, \"you see our little flower died\r\nafter a while, and all the other little flowers died; and this brought\r\nus to the end of our third summer on the island and into the third\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\"This winter passed away as the previous ones had done, and we felt\r\nstill greater resignation.\r\n\r\n\"'Here we are forever,' said the Dean, 'and that we must make up our\r\nminds to. It is God's will, and we must bow before it and be\r\nreconciled.'\r\n\r\n\"'I fear, Dean, that is so,' I answered, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"This was in the month of February, and the sunlight was coming back,\r\nand, to see if we could not catch a glimpse of the god of day, we had\r\ngone out together, wading through the snow.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean felt it when he said 'we must be reconciled'; but he had\r\nhardly spoken when our attention was quickly called away from such\r\nreflections (and from the sun too) by seeing something dark upon the\r\nfrozen sea, not far away from us. It was moving.\r\n\r\n\"We were not long in doubt as to what it was, for we had seen too many\r\npolar bears to be cheated this time,--a bear, without any doubt at all.\r\n\r\n\"He was running very fast, and was making directly towards the island.\r\nHe soon ran behind a large iceberg, and for a little while was out of\r\nsight; but he appeared again soon afterwards, and held on in the same\r\ncourse. Then we lost him once more among rough ice, and then again he\r\ncame in view. He appeared so dark at first, that less-experienced\r\npersons might have been uncertain about what it was; for although the\r\npolar bear is usually called the white bear, yet in truth he has a\r\nyellowish hue, and is quite dark, at least in comparison with the pure\r\nwhite snow.\r\n\r\n\"'It's another bear, I do believe!' exclaimed the Dean, and at once we\r\nmade for the hut. But the bear was running much faster than we were, and\r\nwas moreover coming in right towards the place for which we were bound.\r\nSo we grew much alarmed, and quickened our speed, not however without\r\ndifficulty; for the snow was, in places, very deep.\r\n\r\n\"By and by the bear, which proved to be a very large one, caught sight\r\nof us; and, as you know already that the polar bear is rather a cowardly\r\nbeast than otherwise, you will not be much surprised to learn that, when\r\nhe saw us, he altered his course, and turned off from the island as fast\r\nas he could go. Seeing him do this (as you may be sure to our great\r\ndelight), we halted to watch him; and now we perceived, for the first\r\ntime, that the animal was pursued. By what we could not imagine, but,\r\nclearly enough, by something; for in the distance, and from the quarter\r\nwhence the bear had come, there was plainly to be seen, winding among\r\nthe bergs and rough masses of ice, something dark following on the very\r\ntrack which the bear had taken, sometimes lost to sight and sometimes in\r\nfull view, and growing larger every moment, just as the bear had done.\r\n\r\n\"Nearer and nearer came this object, and our wonder increased. Presently\r\nwe heard a cry.\r\n\r\n\"'Hark!' said the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"The cry was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"'A dog!' exclaimed the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"'A dog!' said I, in answer, for I heard it distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"'Hark!' said the Dean again, for there was another sound.\r\n\r\n\"'A man,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'A man!' repeated the Dean, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"And a man it was.\r\n\r\n\"Dogs and men! what could they be doing there? was the question that ran\r\nthrough both our minds at once.\r\n\r\n\"But dogs and a man (not men) there were, and whatever they might be\r\ndoing there, or whence they might have come, it was certain that dogs\r\nand a man made the dark spot which we saw upon the white sea; and it\r\nwas, moreover, clear that they were pursuing the bear which had passed\r\nus and was now pretty far away.\r\n\r\n\"Nearer and nearer came the dogs and man, and the sounds became more and\r\nmore distinct; the dogs were upon the bear's tracks, the man was upon a\r\nsledge to which the dogs were fastened. At length they came so near that\r\nthe dogs could be easily counted. They were seven, and all of different\r\ncolors, and were fastened with long lines to the sledge, so that they\r\nwere a great way in front of it, and they were running all abreast. They\r\nwere straining and pressing into their collars, all the while crying\r\nimpatiently, as they bounded over the snow at a rapid gallop. The man\r\nwas encouraging them along all he could with a long whip, which he threw\r\nout with a lively snap, exclaiming, 'Ka-ka! ka-ka!' over and over again;\r\nand then, 'Nen-ook, nen-ook, nen-ook!'--many times repeated; for he was\r\nnow so near that we could distinguish every word he said.\r\n\r\n\"It was a wild chase, and the Dean and I became much excited over it,\r\nrunning all the time to get nearer to the passing sledge and man and\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n\"Very soon we should have met, but suddenly the bear came in full view\r\nof the dogs, evidently for the first time. Up to this moment the dogs\r\nhad only been following the track.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs, now leaving the track, gave a wild, concerted howl, and\r\ndashed off after the bear in a straight line. Man, sledge, dogs, and all\r\npassed us quickly by,--the man shouting more excitedly than ever to his\r\ndogs, sometimes calling them by name, as it seemed to us, and sometimes\r\ncrying 'Nen-ook, nen-ook!' and sometimes, 'Ka-ka! ka-ka!' and so away\r\nthey went, rushing like the wind,--the whole scene more strange than\r\nstrangest dream,--the dogs and man like spectral things, so quickly had\r\nthey come and so unexpectedly; or, at the least, the dogs seemed like\r\nhowling wolves, and the man a wild man of the frozen ocean, clothed in\r\nwild beasts' skins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Race for Life.]\r\n\r\n\"We called to the man to stop; we shouted, 'Come here, come here!' and\r\nthen again, 'Come back, come back!' as loud as we could shout, waving\r\nour caps, and throwing up our arms, and running in a frantic way; but\r\nnot the slightest notice would he take of us, not one instant would he\r\nstop, but upon his course and purpose he kept right on, pushing after\r\nthe running bear, without appearing to give us even a single thought. We\r\ncould not doubt that he had seen us, we were so near to him.\r\n\r\n\"On went the bear, on after him went the dogs and sledge and man. More\r\nimpatient grew the dogs, louder called the man to his excited team, and\r\nthe Dean and I ran after, shouting still, as we had done in the\r\nbeginning. We came soon upon the sledge track, and followed it at our\r\ngreatest speed.\r\n\r\n\"At length the cries of the dogs grew indistinct, and then died away at\r\nlast entirely, and the man's voice was no longer heard; and that which\r\nhad come so suddenly soon became but a dark moving speck upon the great\r\nwhite frozen sea, as it had first appeared; but after it we still\r\nfollowed on.\r\n\r\n\"Then the moving speck faded out of sight, and everything around was\r\nstill and cold and solemn and desolate as before. Yet still we ran and\r\nran.\r\n\r\n\"I said as desolate as before. But O, it was a thousand times more\r\ndesolate now than ever,--as the night is darker for the lightning flash\r\nthat has died away, or a cloudy noon is colder for a single ray of\r\nsunshine that has broken through the vapors.\r\n\r\n\"Yet on and on we ran and ran, until we could run no more.\r\n\r\n\"And then we laid us down upon the snow and wept, and bemoaned our hard,\r\nhard fate; but no word was spoken. The disappointment was too great for\r\nwords; and, after a short rest in the chilly air upon the frozen sea, we\r\nwandered slowly back to our poor hut; and after many weary hours we\r\nreached it, not so much alive as dead,--for through miles and miles of\r\nheavy snow we had run after the sledge, and through these same miles we\r\nhad trudged back again, with the cruel disappointment rankling in our\r\nhearts, and with no hope to buoy us up.\r\n\r\n\"Strange--was it not?--that at no period of our life upon the desert\r\nisland were we so unhappy as we were that day,--never so utterly cast\r\ndown, never so broken-spirited, never looking on the future with such\r\nhopelessness.\r\n\r\n\"And in this state of mind we crawled beneath our furs, feeling too\r\nlonely and forsaken to have a thought to cook a meal, and so very, very\r\nweary with the labor we had done, in running and wading through the\r\nheavy snow, that we did not care for food; and in deep sleep we buried\r\nup the heaviest sorrow that we had ever known,--the grievous sorrow of a\r\ndead, dead hope,--the hope of rescue that had come and gone from us, as\r\nthe cloud-shadow flies across the summer field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nA very Peculiar Person appears and disappears, and the\r\nCastaways are filled alternately with Hope and Fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How long we slept I have not the least idea. It may have been a whole\r\nday, or it may have been two days. It was not a twenty years' sleep,\r\n(how we wished it was!) like that of Rip Van Winkle, yet it was a very\r\nlong sleep; and, indeed, neither of us cared how long it lasted, we were\r\nso heartbroken about what seemed to be the greatest misfortune that had\r\nyet happened to us. If we woke up at any time, we went to sleep again as\r\nquickly as possible, not caring at all to come back any sooner than was\r\nnecessary to the contemplation of our miserable situation,--never\r\nreflecting for a moment that the situation had not been changed in the\r\nleast by the unknown man who had appeared and disappeared in such a\r\nmysterious way. But the sight of him had brought our thoughts freshly\r\nback to the world from which we had been cut off,--a world with human\r\nbeings in it like ourselves; and it was not unnatural, therefore, that\r\nwe should be made miserable by the event. And so we slept on and on, and\r\nthus we drowned everything but our dreams, which are everywhere very apt\r\nto be most bright and cheering in the most gloomy and despondent times.\r\nSuch, at least, was the case with me; and if I could have kept dreaming\r\nand dreaming on forever, about pleasant things to eat, and pleasant\r\npeople talking to me, I should have been quite well satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see what a great number of ups and downs we had,--sometimes\r\nbeing cheerful and fully resigned, then again buried in the very depths\r\nof despair. Sometimes we felt real pleasure in the life to which we had\r\nbecome so well accustomed; and it seemed to us, as we chatted together\r\nin our warm and well-lighted hut, that, since every necessary want was\r\nwell supplied, and we were entirely free from care, we should be well\r\nsatisfied to continue in that situation all our lives. We had, in truth,\r\nfew troubles and few anxieties. Food, fuel, and clothing we possessed in\r\nabundance, and no fears crossed our minds that they would ever fail us.\r\n\r\n\"But this satisfactory state of mind, so natural at times, was apt to be\r\nbroken up by a very slight occurrence,--unusual fatigue, a restless\r\nsleep, a severe storm confining us to the hut for many days together, or\r\nby the disappointment we so often experienced when an object which we\r\nhad confidently believed to be a ship proved to be but an iceberg. Nor\r\nwas this more unnatural than that we should at times be perfectly happy\r\nand well contented. Thus are we all made, and thus are we all, at times,\r\ninconsistent; being often unhappy when there is no assignable cause, and\r\noften experiencing the sense of great happiness, under circumstances\r\napparently the most distressing.\r\n\r\n\"You will see, therefore, that there is but one way for any of us to\r\npreserve an even temper and uniform disposition; that is, I mean, always\r\nto be cheerful, never despondent, ever hopeful; and this can only be\r\nattained by always feeling the real presence of God with us; when we\r\nmeet with disappointment, to say in our hearts, 'Well, it was not the\r\nwill of God,' or, if we meet with what seems great good fortune, 'It is\r\nthe will of God that we do some good work, and therefore he has thus\r\nblessed us.' Thus only can we be truly happy. With this feeling there is\r\nalways consolation in distress. It begets charity, and love, and\r\nconfidence, and gentleness; it makes the heart light and the face\r\ncheerful, and the life like a sunbeam gladdening where it goes. That's\r\nwhat the love of God does.\r\n\r\n\"These thoughts are suggested to me by the experiences that the Dean and\r\nI were having at the time I speak of. How much more happy we should have\r\nbeen, had we felt always as I have last described! we should then never\r\nhave been cast down, but should have been always hopeful,--never wishing\r\nto sleep on and on, and thus drown sorrow. We should not have felt as we\r\ndid now when the strange man had come from the frozen sea and\r\ndisappeared again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to come back to the story, we were not allowed to sleep as long\r\nas we wanted to. Our sleep was indeed brought to an end very suddenly. I\r\nwas first startled by a great noise, and then, springing up, much\r\nalarmed, I aroused the Dean, who was a sounder sleeper even than myself.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the matter?' cried he.\r\n\r\n\"'Didn't you hear a noise?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'No!' answered the Dean; 'nothing more, at least, than a church-bell,\r\nand that was in my sleep,'--which was clear enough.\r\n\r\n\"Presently I heard the noise again, and this time it seemed to proceed\r\nfrom something not far off. It was now the Dean's turn to be amazed.\r\n\r\n\"'Did you hear?' I asked again.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said the Dean, holding his breath to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Again the strange sound was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"'Is it the wind?'\r\n\r\n\"'How can it be? the wind does not make a noise like that!'\r\n\r\n\"'Can it be a bear?'\r\n\r\n\"'No! it cannot be a bear!'\r\n\r\n\"'A fox? perhaps it is a fox!'\r\n\r\n\"'No, listen! there it is again.'\r\n\r\n\"The sound was louder now, and nearer to the hut. Again and again it was\r\nrepeated,--nearer now and more constant; then a footfall on the crusted\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"'It is a man! the bear-hunter has come back again!' spoke the Dean,\r\nthrowing up his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Again the noise was heard; again the footfall creaked upon the snow.\r\n\r\n\"'The bear-hunter, it must be!' cried the Dean, again.\r\n\r\n\"'O, I pray that it is so!' I added, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Again the voice was heard. I answered it. The answer was returned, and\r\nwith the answer came a heavier and more rapid creaking of the footfalls\r\non the snow.\r\n\r\n\"We rushed from the hut into the open air without another moment's loss\r\nof time, and without saying another word; and there, not ten yards away,\r\nstood the very man who had passed us on the sledge,--the bear-hunter of\r\nthe frozen sea.\r\n\r\n\"And a strange-looking creature he was, to be sure. There was not the\r\nleast sign of alarm or fear about him; but, on the contrary, he was\r\nlooking mightily pleased, and was talking very fast in a language of\r\nwhich the Dean and I could neither of us understand a single word. When\r\nhe was not talking he was laughing, and his enormous mouth was stretched\r\nalmost from ear to ear. '_Yeh, yeh!_' he went, and I went that way too,\r\nby way of answer, which seemed greatly to delight him. He was dressed\r\nall over in furs, and looked very wild; but, as he kept _yeh-yeh_-ing\r\nall the time, we were not afraid. As he came up to us, we greeted him\r\nvery cordially; but he could no more understand what we said than we\r\ncould understand him. He talked very much, and gesticulated a great\r\ndeal, pointing very often in one particular direction with his right\r\nhand. Then he cried, 'Mick-ee, mick-ee!' and pointed to the beach below,\r\ntowards which we followed him. There we found a sledge and seven dogs;\r\nand now we understood very certainly, if we had any doubts before, that\r\nthis was the man and these were the dogs that had passed us, following\r\nthe bear.\r\n\r\n\"The man tried his best to explain to us the whole affair, talking very\r\nrapidly; but we could not gather from what he said more than our eyes\r\ntold us already, for on the sledge we soon discovered a large bear-skin,\r\nall bloody and folded up, and some large pieces of bear's meat. The dogs\r\nwere tied some distance from the sledge, and were securely fastened by\r\ntheir traces to a heavy stone, which I was very glad of, for the\r\nwolfish-looking beasts were snarling at each other, and fighting, and\r\nhowling at us continually,--seeming all the while to wish themselves\r\nloose, that they might fly upon us, and tear us to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"If we could not understand the hunter's words, we made out by his\r\nsigns, after a while, that he had seen us when he passed in pursuit of\r\nthe bear. After overtaking and capturing the animal, he turned about\r\nupon his track to look for us, and, finding our footmarks at last, he\r\nhad followed us to the hut, calling loudly, as he neared us, to attract\r\nour attention, for he could not find us easily,--our hut was so buried\r\nup in snow.\r\n\r\n\"After being fully satisfied with the inspection of the dogs and sledge,\r\nand what there was upon it, we all three went up to the hut.\r\n\r\n\"It would be difficult to describe our visitor. I have said that he was\r\nwholly dressed in furs. His pantaloons were made of bear-skins reaching\r\nto the knees, where they met the boots, which were made of the same\r\nmaterials. His underclothing was made of birds' skins, like our own, and\r\nhe wore a coat of fox-skins, with a heavy hood covering up the head\r\ncompletely. On his hands he wore mittens made of seal-skins, with warm\r\ndog-skin for an inside lining, and his stockings were of the same. So\r\nyou see no part of him was exposed but his face, which was quite dark,\r\nor, rather, copper-colored (something darker than a North American\r\nIndian), and it was very broad and very round. The nose was very small\r\nand very flat, and the eyes were small and narrow. His hair was jet\r\nblack, long and tangled, and was cut straight across the forehead. He\r\nhad but little beard,--only a few black, wiry-looking bristles growing\r\non his upper lip and on the tip of his chin. You would hardly suppose\r\nthat such a creature could be anything but savage and repulsive; yet\r\nthis he did not seem to be at all; on the contrary he appeared like the\r\nmost amiable fellow that ever was seen.\r\n\r\n\"He sat down before the fire on one of the big stones we used for\r\nstools, and the Dean and I sat one on either side of him; and I can\r\nnever tell you how strange it seemed to be sitting there with another\r\nhuman being besides ourselves, after all that time spent without ever\r\nseeing anybody but each other. It was like a dream. We could hardly\r\nrealize that it was true, as there we sat, staring at the strange man in\r\nwonder and astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"And all this time we were speculating about him,--where he came from,\r\nwhere he was going to, what relation did he hold to the world from which\r\nwe had come in the _Blackbird_, could he tell us where we were, would he\r\ntake us from the island, would he rescue us from this dreary life.\r\n\r\n\"O, how much we would have given for a few words from him that we could\r\nunderstand! How rejoiced we would have been to have these questions\r\nanswered! Answering them, however, he might be even then, for anything\r\nwe knew to the contrary; for he scarcely left off talking a single\r\ninstant, but away he rattled as lively as a magpie and just as\r\nintelligibly. We could make nothing at all out of what he said, any more\r\nthan I could of the hieroglyphics I have since seen on the stones of\r\nEgypt, until he put his hand to his mouth, at the same time throwing his\r\nhead back a little, and repeating, several times, '_Me drinkum, Me\r\ndrinkum._'\r\n\r\n\"This very much surprised us, as we knew that he was asking for water,\r\nwhich having been given him, he then said, '_Me eatum_', signifying that\r\nhe was hungry. We lost no time, therefore, in preparing him a hearty\r\nmeal of ducks and bear's meat, which he appeared to think very fine.\r\nThen he had a great deal to tell us about something that he called\r\n'_Oomeaksuak_', the meaning of which we could not make out; but, as he\r\npointed in a particular direction, we thought he meant the place where\r\nhe lived. We could not understand from him what his name was; so, as we\r\nhad to speak of him to each other constantly, we called him at once\r\n'Eatum,' as that was the word he used most. He amused us very much with\r\nhis frequent repetition of it, and with the enormous quantities of food\r\nhe took into his stomach after he did repeat it; for he only had to say,\r\n'_Me eatum_' to get as much food as he wanted. It soon got to be quite a\r\njoke with us, and when he said, '_Me eatum_' we all three fell, not only\r\nto feeding, but to laughing besides.\r\n\r\n\"Finding himself in such good quarters, Eatum manifested no disposition\r\nto leave them; but, after he had taken a sound sleep, he had a great\r\ndeal to say about '_mickee_', as before; and since he made a great many\r\nmotions, as if using a whip (pointing all the while towards the beach),\r\nwe concluded that he must mean something about his dogs, which we found\r\nto be true, for '_mickee_' in his language means dog, as we afterwards\r\ndiscovered. As soon as we had settled this, we all went out of the hut\r\nagain, and went down and brought the bear's meat and skin on the sledge\r\nup to the hut, and then we fastened the dogs near by. After being fed,\r\nthey all lay down and went to sleep on the snow. These dogs were very\r\nlarge and strong animals; and the seven could draw a very heavy load,--I\r\nshould think that the whole seven could draw as much as a small horse.\r\n\r\n\"Eatum seemed to have been quite exhausted with long hunting when he\r\ncame to us, and he did very little but eat and sleep for several days.\r\nHis nose had been a little touched by the frost, but he scorched some\r\noil, and rubbed it on as we would ointment, and cured it very quickly.\r\n\r\n\"After he had eaten and slept to his entire satisfaction, he appeared to\r\ngrow more lively, and showed a great deal of curiosity about our hut and\r\nfurniture, and hunting implements, being highly pleased with every new\r\nthing he saw. It was very surprising to see how nearly like his own many\r\nof our things were,--our lamp and pot and cups, for instance, and also\r\nour clothing. Our harpoon (the 'Dean's Delight') was almost exactly a\r\nmatch for his.\r\n\r\n\"It was a great drawback to our satisfaction that we could not\r\nunderstand him or he us, but little by little we got over part of this\r\ndifficulty; for, upon discovering that he used one particular word very\r\noften, I guessed that he must be asking a question. The word was\r\n'_Kina_'; so once when he used it he was pointing to our lamp, and I\r\nsaid 'lamp' at a venture, whereupon, after repeating it several times,\r\nhe appeared to be much gratified, and then said, '_Kolipsut_', and this\r\nI repeated after him, which pleased him again. Then I knew that\r\n'_Kina?_' meant 'What is it?' or 'What's this?' so after that we\r\n_kina_-ed everything, and got on finely. We, of course, learned more\r\nrapidly than Eatum, picking up a great many words from him; and, having\r\nboth of us good memories, we got to be able to make him understand us a\r\nlittle in the course of time; and as fast as we learned we taught him,\r\nand he got to know some of our language, in which we encouraged him. 'Me\r\nspeakum much bad,' he would say sometimes, which was very true; but so\r\nlong as we understood him it made little matter.\r\n\r\n\"And now it was that we got to find out how he had picked up the few\r\nwords such as _me drinkum_, _me eatum_, and so on, that he had used at\r\nfirst; for he gave us to know that we were not a long way from where\r\nships came every year, and that some of his people saw the ships when\r\nthey passed, and sometimes went aboard of them. 'Ship' was what he meant\r\nby '_Oomeaksuak_', which word he had at first used so often. He had\r\nfrequently been aboard of an _Oomeaksuak_, he said.\r\n\r\n\"Now this was great news for us, and we began at once to devise means of\r\nescape from the island. We made Eatum understand as much of what we\r\nwanted as possible. All this time I must not neglect to mention,\r\nhowever, that Eatum was of the greatest service to us; for when the\r\nweather was good he would fasten his dogs to the sledge, and all three\r\nof us would go out together on the sea to hunt,--Eatum driving. It was\r\nvery lively sport; and sometimes, when the ice was very smooth and the\r\nsnow hard, we went very fast, almost as fast as a horse would run, even\r\nwith the three of us upon the sledge. The sledge, by the way, I must\r\ntell you, was made out of bits of bones, all cunningly lashed together\r\nwith seal-skin thongs. Once we were caught in a severe gale a good way\r\nfrom home, and had to make a little house to shelter ourselves from it\r\nout of snow; and in this, with our furs on, we managed to sleep quite\r\ncomfortably, and remained there about twenty-four hours before the\r\nweather would permit us to go on again.\r\n\r\n\"While in the snow hut we had a lamp to give us light and warmth; and\r\nthis lamp (which was Eatum's) was made like ours, and Eatum made a\r\nspark, and started a flame, and kept it burning just as we had\r\ndone,--the tinder being the down of the willow blossom (which he carried\r\nwrapped up in several layers of seal-skin), with moss for wick and the\r\nblubber for fuel. The pot in which he melted snow for water, and cooked\r\nour supper, was made, like ours, of soapstone.\r\n\r\n\"When the storm broke, we left the snow hut, and set out for the island;\r\ncatching two seals by the way, and in the very same manner, too, that\r\nthe Dean and I had done long before we ever knew there was such a person\r\nas Eatum in the world. We were much disappointed at not discovering any\r\nbears, and so were the dogs.\r\n\r\n\"But not many days afterward, the weather being fine, we went out upon\r\nthe sea a great way, and were rejoiced to come across a bear's track,\r\nwhich Eatum said was very fresh. No sooner had the dogs seen it than\r\naway they started upon it; and over the ice and snow--rough and smooth,\r\nright upon the track--they ran as fast as they could go.\r\n\r\n\"The bear had been sleeping behind an iceberg, and we had come upon him\r\nso suddenly that he had not time even to get out of sight, and we saw\r\nhim almost as soon as we had discovered the track. '_Nen-ook,\r\nnen-ook!_' cried Eatum, pointing towards the bear; and there he was,\r\nsure enough, running as fast as he could. But, no matter how fast he\r\nran, we went still faster; and it could not have been an hour before we\r\novertook him. Then Eatum leaned forward and untied his dogs, letting\r\nthem run ahead while the sledge stopped. In a few minutes the dogs had\r\nbrought the bear to bay,--surrounding the huge wild beast, and flying at\r\nhis sides, and tormenting him in a very fierce manner. But I always\r\nobserved that they took good care to keep away from his head, for if he\r\nshould get a chance at one of them, and hit him with his huge paws, he\r\nwould mash him flat enough, or knock him all into little bits.\r\n\r\n\"While the dogs were worrying the bear we got out our weapons,--the Dean\r\nhis 'Delight,' I 'Old Crumply,' and Eatum a spear made of a narwhal\r\nhorn, and looking, for all the world, just like 'Old Crumply's' twin\r\nbrother. Then we rushed up to the bear, Eatum leading; and fierce though\r\nthe animal looked, and awfully as he roared, we closed right in upon\r\nhim, and quickly made an end of him. Then we drove off the dogs, and\r\ntied them to a hummock of ice, while we butchered the dead animal and\r\nsecured the skin and what meat we wanted, after which we allowed the\r\ndogs to gorge themselves. Being now too full to haul, we had to let them\r\nlie down and sleep, while we built a snow hut, and, crawling into it,\r\ngot a good rest. Then we returned to the island, mighty well satisfied\r\nwith ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"After this we fell again into conversation about the _Oomeaksuaks_, or\r\nships, as I have explained before; and, having learned more and more of\r\nthe language which Eatum spoke, we got to comprehend him better, so we\r\nfixed clearly in our minds where the place was that the ships came to,\r\nand were fully satisfied that Eatum told the truth about it. We now\r\noffered to give him everything we had if he would take us there, and\r\nstay with us until the ships should come along and take us off his\r\nhands. About this we had several conversations; but just when we thought\r\nthe treaty was complete, and Eatum was going to carry out the plan we\r\nhad fixed upon, this singular savage disappeared very suddenly,--dogs,\r\nsledge, and all,--without saying a single word to us about it.\r\n\r\n\"When we made the discovery that he was gone, we were filled with\r\nastonishment and dismay. We hoped, at first, that he had gone off\r\nhunting; but, finding that he did not return, we tried to follow the\r\ntracks of his sledge, but the wind had drifted snow over them, and we\r\ncould not.\r\n\r\n\"We now made up our minds that Eatum was nothing more than a treacherous\r\nsavage; and we were afraid that he would come back with more savages and\r\nmurder us, in order that he might get the furs and other things that we\r\nhad; so for a while we were much alarmed, and were more heartbroken I\r\nbelieve, than ever before, for our hopes of rescue had been raised very\r\nhigh by hearing of Eatum's people and the ships. The suddenness with\r\nwhich all our expectations were thus dashed to the ground quite overcame\r\nus, and we passed the next five days very miserably, hardly stirring out\r\nof the hut during all that time. But at length we saw the folly of\r\ngiving way to despair.\r\n\r\n\"One thing we quickly determined upon, and that was to leave the island,\r\none way or another; for now we were so afraid of the savages coming to\r\nmurder us, that we would suffer any risk and hardship rather than remain\r\nthere longer. So once more we began to devise means for our safety.\r\n\r\n\"It was no longer what we should do for food and fuel, or clothing, but\r\nhow we should escape. The ships we had given up long ago, and with the\r\nships had vanished every hope of rescue. But now a wild man had come to\r\nus out of the ice-desert, and had told us that ships came in the summer\r\nnot far from where we were, and through this intelligence we had\r\nobtained a glimpse of home and our native country, as it were; and this\r\ntoo at the very time when we had become most reconciled to our\r\ncondition, and had made up our minds to live as best we could on the\r\nRock of Good Hope for the remainder of our days.\r\n\r\n\"But now our minds were wholly changed. 'We are worse off than ever,'\r\nsaid the Dean, 'for this little hope the savage gave us, and the fear,\r\nbesides, that he has put into us,'--which was true enough.\r\n\r\n\"Stimulated now by the memory of that hope and the presence of that\r\nfear, we prepared to undertake the bold task of rescuing ourselves. The\r\nsavage had pointed out to us the direction of the place where the ships\r\npassed, 'And now,' we thought, 'if we can only reach the land there\r\nbefore the summer comes we shall be all right.' But if we should not get\r\nto the proper place, or if the ships did not come along, then the\r\nchances were that we might starve or freeze to death. Nothing daunted,\r\nhowever, by the contemplation of that gloomy side of the picture, we\r\nwent earnestly to work, and very soon had contrived a plan.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we must have a sledge, as we were obliged to travel a long\r\ndistance, and must carry not only food to eat by the way, but blubber\r\nfor a lamp with which to melt water from the snow, and furs to keep us\r\nwarm while we slept. Eatum had taught us how to construct a snow hut, so\r\nthat we felt sure of being able to shelter ourselves from the storms.\r\n\r\n\"But the sledge was the great difficulty. How should we make a sledge?\r\nwas the question which most occupied our thoughts, and taxed our\r\ningenuity. Apparently we had nothing to make it of, nor tools to make it\r\nwith. To fasten together pieces of bone in the manner that Eatum had\r\ndone, and thus construct a runner, was not possible, as we had no drill\r\nto make holes with,--and besides, if we had, the work would have\r\nrequired too long a time for our present necessities. Our purpose was to\r\nget away from the island with all possible haste.\r\n\r\n\"We made a sledge, however, at last, and in a very ingenious way as we\r\nthought, though not a particularly good way as we afterwards discovered.\r\nFirst we cut two strips of seal-skin, and sewed them into tubes. Then we\r\nfilled the tubes with hair, and pieces of meat chopped very fine, and\r\nalso bits of moss. Then we poured water into the tubes, and flattened\r\nthem down by stamping upon them. Very soon the whole froze together,\r\nsolid as a board, and these we soon fashioned into the proper shape for\r\nrunners. We found no difficulty in fastening the two together with\r\ncross-ties of bone, which we lashed firmly to the runners. Thus, in\r\nseven days from the time of beginning to work upon it, our sledge was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\"Very much rejoiced over this triumph, we put a load on the sledge, and\r\nset out to give it a trial. But one runner gave way before we had gone a\r\ndozen fathoms, and we were in a state of great perplexity. We resolved\r\nnow to bundle up everything we needed in a bear-skin, and drag that over\r\nthe snow after us, so great was our haste to get away. We would drag the\r\nbear-skin head-foremost, so that the fur would slip more easily over the\r\nsnow. But when we had done this, we discovered that, to say nothing of\r\ndragging the load, we could not even start it. Our united efforts were\r\nwholly unequal to the task of moving it even so much as an inch; and,\r\nlike Robinson Crusoe with his boat, we had wholly miscalculated the\r\nmeans, thinking only of the end. And so it is sometimes, even with wiser\r\nheads than ours.\r\n\r\n\"We were now in even greater trouble than ever; but being at length\r\nfully satisfied of the utter hopelessness of proceeding in this manner,\r\nwe went back next day to the sledge, and began to work upon it again;\r\nall the while looking out for the savages, and expecting them every\r\nminute to come and murder us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA Number of Peculiar People appear, and the Castaways\r\ndisappear from the Rock of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We worked away at the sledge as fast as possible, being bent upon\r\nhaving it finished and getting off from the island as quickly as we\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"At last it was completed, and we dragged it down to the beach and out\r\nupon the ice. Finding that it went better than we had dared to expect,\r\nwe returned to our hut, and, bundling together such of our furs and\r\nother things as we thought we should require on the long journey before\r\nus, carried them down and stowed them on the sledge. Among them were\r\nincluded one lamp, one pot, and one cup. We could not drag a very heavy\r\nload, even if the sledge would bear up under it, so we had to limit\r\nourselves to the least possible allowance of everything. Food was, of\r\ncourse, more important to us than anything else, and of this we\r\ndetermined to take all that we could put upon the sledge with safety.\r\n\r\n\"All this time we felt very sad, and we worked in a very gloomy spirit.\r\nEverything appeared so uncertain before us; the journey we were about to\r\nundertake, at first seeming to promise so hopefully, had become a very\r\ndoubtful undertaking; and, since day after day passed by without\r\nbringing the savages upon us, we got to be less afraid of them, and in\r\nthis same proportion was reduced our confidence in the propriety of\r\nleaving the island in this manner for an unknown place, and in utter\r\nignorance as to whether the savage had told us truth about the ships.\r\n\r\n\"However, as you have seen before, when the Dean and I got an idea in\r\nour heads we did not easily abandon it. Once determined to make the\r\ntrial, we had persevered until we had obtained a sledge; and now, as I\r\nhave told you, it was already half loaded.\r\n\r\n\"But we might have saved ourselves all this trouble, as you will soon\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\"While in the very midst of our packing, we were suddenly startled by a\r\nloud noise. Looking up from our work, and turning in the direction\r\nwhence the sound proceeded, there, to our horror and dismay, were the\r\nvery savages we had been for so long a time expecting. They were just\r\nrounding a point of the island, and were nearing us at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\n\"We soon discovered them to be five in number, each riding upon a\r\nsledge, drawn by wild and fierce-looking dogs, that made a great outcry\r\nas soon as they saw us, as did also the savages on the sledges.\r\n\r\n\"'At last,' thought I, 'our time has come. We shall be murdered now for\r\ncertain, and then be given to the dogs for food.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' exclaimed the Dean, 'if our poor mothers only knew where we\r\nwere!'\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous as appeared to be our situation, I could still not help\r\nasking the Dean whether he did not think it would be quite as much to\r\nthe purpose if we only knew where we were ourselves,--to which, however,\r\nhe made no reply, for the savages were almost upon us. Seizing our\r\nweapons, we prepared to defend ourselves, since there was no use trying\r\nto run away, as the dogs would be atop of us before we could reach the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n\"But there was not the least use of our being so much alarmed, for the\r\nsavages soon convinced us that they meant no harm. They would not let\r\ntheir dogs come near us, but kept them off, and, stopping, tied them\r\nfast. Then, without any weapons in their hands, they came up to us in a\r\nmost friendly manner, all _yeh-yeh_-ing at a wonderful rate. So we took\r\nthe five of them right off up to the hut, and now our fears were turned\r\ninto rejoicing and our sorrow into joy. One of them was Eatum, and they\r\nall proved to be just as singular-looking people, and were as curious\r\nabout us and about everything we had as Eatum had been. Their faces were\r\non a broad grin all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Having learned something of their language from Eatum, as I told you\r\nbefore, we contrived to make them understand, with the aid of a great\r\nmany signs, how the ship had been wrecked, and how we got first to the\r\nice and then to the land,--for this they were most curious about,--and\r\nthey were greatly puzzled to know how we came to be there at all. After\r\nthis they treated us quite affectionately, patting us on the back, and\r\nexclaiming, _Tyma, tyma_, which we knew to mean 'Good, good,' as Eatum\r\nhad told us. Then Eatum wanted to show himself off in our language, and,\r\npointing to us, he said, 'Hunter plenty good, plenty eat get. All same,'\r\n(pointing to himself by way of illustration, and thus finishing it,)\r\n'_tyma? yeh-yeh, yeh!_' which was the way he had of laughing, as I told\r\nyou before, and all the rest _yeh, yeh_-ed just like him. One of them we\r\ncalled at once 'Old Grim,' because he _yeh-yeh_-ed with his insides;\r\nbut no laugh ever showed itself in his face.\r\n\r\n\"After their curiosity was satisfied, they imitated Eatum, and began to\r\ncall loudly, _drinkum_ and then _eatum_,--_yeh-yeh_-ing as before in a\r\nvery lively manner; so that, what with their _yeh-yeh_-ing and _eatum_\r\nand _drinkum_, there was quite a merry time of it. Meanwhile, however,\r\nwe were busying ourselves to satisfy their wants, and it was not long\r\nbefore the savages were as full as they could hold. It was a curious\r\nsight to see them eat. They would put one end of a great chunk of meat\r\nin the mouth, and, holding tight to the other end, they would cut it off\r\nclose up to the lips. Our seal-blubber they treated in the same way. To\r\nthis blubber they seemed to be very partial; and, indeed, all people\r\nliving in cold climates soon grow fond of fat of every kind. It is such\r\nstrong food, which people require there as much as they do warm\r\nclothing, and in great quantities too. The people living in the Arctic\r\nregions have little desire for vegetable food; and the savages there eat\r\nnothing but meat, fish, and fat.\r\n\r\n\"Our guests did not leave off eating until each had consumed a quantity\r\nof food equal at least to the size of his head; and then they grew\r\ndrowsy, and wanted to _singikpok_, which we knew from Eatum meant sleep;\r\nand in _singikpok_ we were glad enough to indulge them, although greatly\r\nto our inconvenience, for they nearly filled our hut.\r\n\r\n\"But before this we went down to the sledge and brought up the furs and\r\nother things we had stowed upon it for our journey, as we needed them\r\nfor the accommodation of our visitors. The savages went with us, and\r\nwhen they saw what a sledge we had made, and understood what sort of\r\njourney we were going upon, they laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You must understand, however, that we did not give up the journey; but,\r\non the contrary, were more than ever disposed to make it. For, although\r\nwe could see no harm in the savages, yet we put no trust in them,--they\r\nappeared to have no serious side to them at all, but treated everything\r\nwith such levity that we could not tell what to make of them. Sometimes\r\nwe wished they would go away; and then again we wished they would stay;\r\nand then we wished they would take us with them, and then again we were\r\nafraid to trust them. Thus did our hopes and fears alternately get the\r\nbetter of us.\r\n\r\n\"The savages slept very soundly for a while; but one by one they woke\r\nup, and, as soon as their eyes were open, they fell to eating again\r\nuntil they were satisfied, and then in a minute afterwards they were\r\nfast asleep. This they kept up for about two days, and you may be sure\r\nthey made way with a great deal of our provisions before they had\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\"When they had thoroughly gorged themselves, and slept all they could,\r\nthey were ready to start off again; and now we found that they had come\r\nto take us away,--a discovery which was both agreeable and disagreeable;\r\nfor we could not tell what to make of the savages at all, we could\r\nunderstand so little of what they meant, or of what they said, or of\r\nwhat their designs might be respecting us.\r\n\r\n\"'However,' we thought, 'after all here is a possible chance of escape\r\nand rescue,' and, like a drowning man catching at a straw, we could not\r\nseriously think of allowing the opportunity to slip; besides, there\r\nproved in the end to be little chance of our having our own will in the\r\nmatter, since the savages never once asked us if we would go with them,\r\nbut began to bundle up our furs, food, and blubber, and everything else\r\nwe had, as if resolved to take us whether or no.\r\n\r\n\"At first we felt a little alarm,--without expressing it, however; but,\r\nseeing how good-natured they were about it, and how considerate they\r\nappeared to be for us, we had no further fear, but trusted them\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\"The savages went to work with a hearty good-will to get us off. Not a\r\nthing escaped them,--not a piece of fur of any kind; fox-skins,\r\nbird-skins, bear-skins, pots, lamps, and everything else, were picked up\r\nand carried off just as if we had no right to them at all; and although\r\nthere were, as I have said, five sledges, yet these were all quite\r\nheavily laden.\r\n\r\n\"As we passed down by our sledge, the savages set up another laugh at\r\nit. It seemed to amuse them very much, but they showed no disposition to\r\ntake it along.\r\n\r\n\"At last we were all ready. The sledges were all stowed, everything was\r\ntightly lashed down, and off we started,--I riding on the sledge with\r\nEatum, while the Dean was on the sledge of 'Old Grim.'\r\n\r\n\"The Dean carried his 'Delight,' of course, while I held on to 'Old\r\nCrumply.' Nor were our 'palm and needle,' and jack-knife, that had done\r\nsuch good service, forgotten. Indeed, we brought away everything.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we were very much rejoiced to get away from the Rock of Good\r\nHope, even although our fortunes were yet very uncertain; still, it had\r\nbeen our rock of refuge and safety, and, in our thankfulness, we could\r\nnot fail to cast upon it a look of tender regret at parting from it.\r\nTogether there the Dean and I had achieved many triumphs which were to\r\nus a source of great pride, and would always continue to be as long as\r\nwe lived; while, on the other hand, if we had suffered many discomforts\r\nand sorrows, these would not, we knew, linger long in the memory.\r\nBesides, on the Rock of Good Hope, and in the hut we were leaving, we\r\nhad learned to know each other, and to love each other, and to be bound\r\ntogether by a strong bond of friendship, which, as it was formed in\r\nadversity, was not likely to be broken.\r\n\r\n\"But then, on the other hand, the prospect that loomed up ahead of us\r\nwas not of a very encouraging description. 'Where were the savages\r\ntaking us? what would they do with us?' were questions which kept\r\nhaunting us all the time. We could see nothing clearly; and no matter\r\nwhat might happen in the end for our advantage, we must, in any case,\r\nlive among these wild people for an indefinite time, subject to their\r\nsavage caprices and savage and lawless ways of life.\r\n\r\n\"But we soon had to give up speculating about the prospect ahead, and\r\nhad to let the Rock of Good Hope, and the hut, and the life we had led\r\nthere, with its struggles and trials and triumphs, pass away as some\r\nvaguely remembered dream; for on we sped, with our caravan of sledges,\r\nover the frozen sea,--the dogs all lively, and galloping away with their\r\nbushy tails curled over their backs, and their heads up; their savage\r\ndrivers crying to them, now and then, '_Ka-ka! ka-ka!_' and snapping\r\ntheir whips to keep them at a brisker run, and all the while talking to\r\neach other in a loud voice,--sometimes, as we could clearly understand,\r\nabout ourselves, sometimes whether they should go off on a bear-hunt.\r\nOccasionally one of the teams would scent a seal-hole, and away the dogs\r\nwould rush towards it as hard as they could go, all the other teams\r\nfollowing after, pell-mell; and, when they reached the hole, it was all\r\nthe hunters could do, by whipping and shouting and scolding, to keep the\r\nteams from coming atop of each other, and getting into a snarl. Once\r\nthis happened with two of the teams. The dogs all became tangled in each\r\nother's traces, the sledges got locked together, and the animals fell to\r\nfighting, one team against the other, in a most vicious manner.\r\n\r\n\"This was such a novel mode of travelling that we enjoyed it immensely,\r\neven although it was pretty cold and the journey was very long. It\r\nseemed strange to us to be thus wandering, without chart or compass,\r\nover the great ice-desert on the sea; for all around us was nothing but\r\na great plain of whiteness, only broken here and there by an iceberg,\r\nwhich glittered like a great diamond in the bright sunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Children of the Frozen Sea.]\r\n\r\n\"We must have gone at least sixty or seventy miles before we made a\r\nsingle halt; and then we came to the village where these savages lived.\r\nIt was not on the land, but out on the frozen sea over which we had\r\ntravelled. As we approached, the dogs ran very fast. '_Igloo, igloo!_'\r\nexclaimed the savages, pointing, when we neared the village. As we had\r\nalready learned that _igloo_ meant hut, in their language, we were much\r\nrejoiced; for we were very tired with the long journey, and cold\r\nbesides. But still we fell to wondering what sort of place this was we\r\nwere coming to, and what strange sight we were next going to see.\r\n\r\n\"Old Grim drove his sledge close up along side of Eatum's, trying to\r\npass; and we went into the village with a perfect rush,--the men\r\nshouting, the dogs barking, and everything in an uproar generally.\r\n\r\n\"While this race between Old Grim and Eatum was going on, the Dean and I\r\nwere for a few moments side by side, and near together. The Dean called\r\nout to me, 'Hardy, this don't seem real, does it? These ain't dogs, they\r\nare wolves; these ain't men, they're devils'; and, as I looked over at\r\nOld Grim, and saw him throwing his long whip to right and left, and\r\nheard him calling out to his dogs in a language which seemed like\r\nnothing human, and all the while preserving the same immovable\r\nexpression of countenance, I must confess that there seemed to be a\r\ngreat deal of truth in what the Dean said.\r\n\r\n\"Thus it was we went rushing into the village. And a strange village,\r\nindeed, it proved to be,--nothing but a collection of huts made of\r\nfrost-hardened snow. There were in all six of them.\r\n\r\n\"Many more savages were there, who came out to meet us; and their dogs\r\nrushed out too, making a great noise; and when we had halted, a number\r\nof women joined them, all dressed in furs just like the men, and also\r\nchildren dressed in the same way, and all very curious about us, and all\r\n_yeh-yeh_-ing a great deal. Indeed, we made such a commotion in the\r\nvillage as never was seen before.\r\n\r\n\"But everybody appeared to be kindly disposed towards us, and into one\r\nof the huts we were both taken immediately, and down we sat on the floor\r\nof the hut, which was covered all over with bear-skins. There were two\r\nlamps in it, almost exactly like ours, and two pots were hanging over\r\nthem. We had soon a good meal, and very quickly after that were sound\r\nasleep; and even although it was a snow hut, and among savages, we were\r\nthankful in our very heart of hearts. And our thankfulness was because\r\nwe were among human beings once more, and felt no longer as if we were\r\nwholly cast away from the world; and we now felt hopeful that through\r\nthese savages would come means of escape to our homes. We felt thankful,\r\ntoo, that they treated us so kindly,--the women especially; for, savages\r\nthough they were, they were possessed of much feeling and sympathy. One\r\nof the women made the Dean go to sleep with his head in her lap, which\r\nit was easy to see he did not like a bit; and, before this, she had fed\r\nhim with her own fingers, and, while he was sleeping, she stroked his\r\nbright hair away from his handsome face. Another of the women treated me\r\nvery much in the same way; but being older, and not handsome, like the\r\nDean, I did not come in for so many favors.\r\n\r\n\"Then, besides that, the women took off our damp fur stockings, and gave\r\nus dry ones before we went to sleep; and they seemed to want to do\r\neverything they could for us, so that we soon became convinced they\r\nmeant us no harm. The woman who was particularly kind to me was the wife\r\nof Eatum; and the Dean and I at once called her Mrs. Eatum, which made\r\nthem all _yeh-yeh_ very much; and they got to calling her that too,--as\r\nnear, at least, as they could pronounce it which was, _Impsuseatum_. Her\r\nright name was _Serkut_, which means 'little nose'; Eatum's right name\r\nwas _Tuk-tuk_, that is, reindeer, because he could run very fast. There\r\nwere two young Eatums; and when I began to play with them, I grew in\r\ngreat favor with the Eatum family.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean was quite as well off for patrons as I, being specially taken\r\ncare of by a woman whose husband had been one of our party. Her name I\r\nforget now, but it meant 'big toes.' So what with nursing by 'Mrs.\r\nLittle-nose' and 'Mrs. Big-toes,' and with plenty of seal meat to eat,\r\nthe Dean and I got on famously. The name of Mrs. Big-toes' husband was\r\n_Awak_, which means walrus. He was a fine hunter, and had plenty of\r\ndogs. These dogs, I should mention, were always allowed to run loose\r\nabout the village; and, no matter how cold it was, they slept on the\r\nsnow. But their harness had to be taken off, else they would eat it; and\r\neverything eatable was buried out of sight in the snow, or brought\r\ninside the hut.\r\n\r\n\"After we had been eating, and sleeping, and enjoying the hospitality of\r\nthese savages about three days, a young hunter whose name was _Kossuit_,\r\nwhich meant that he was a little dark-skinned fellow, came driving into\r\nthe village (he had been out prospecting for a hunt), proclaiming, in a\r\nvery loud voice, that there was a great crack in the ice, and that it\r\nwas alive with walrus and seal. There was immediately a great stir, and\r\na great harnessing of dogs, and hunting up of whips, and getting\r\ntogether of harpoons and spears and lines. Everybody was going on the\r\nhunt, that is, all the men and boys. When all was ready, Eatum came to\r\nme, and said, 'Ketchum _awak_, ketchum _pussay_, you go?' meaning, would\r\nwe go with them, and catch walrus and seals. Of course we said 'yes,'\r\nand off we started at a wild pace; the Dean riding with Kossuit, while I\r\nrode with Eatum. We had to go I should think four miles before we came\r\nto the crack; and, when we reached it, we found it to be as Kossuit had\r\ndescribed it. As soon as the savages saw the crack, they stopped their\r\ndogs, which was done by crying, _Eigh, eigh, eigh!_ to them, and\r\nwhipping then:, fiercely if they did not mind soon enough. The dogs\r\nbeing now fastened by running the points of the runners into the snow,\r\nthe hunters went forward with their lines and spears and harpoons; and,\r\nby approaching the side of the crack very cautiously, they managed at\r\nlength to get near enough to throw their harpoons into the animals when\r\nthey came up to the surface to breathe. Their mode of capturing them was\r\nalmost the same as that which we employed in catching seals, after\r\nfinding it out for ourselves. Thus you see how all people in the same\r\nconditions of life will naturally be led to the same way of providing\r\nfor their wants,--our senses being given to us all, whether savage or\r\ncivilized, for the same purpose. I have showed you already how, in our\r\nmode of starting a fire, in our lamp, pot, and other domestic\r\nimplements; our clothing, harpoon, and the like,--we had imitated these\r\nsavages unconsciously; and the more I was with them, the more I saw how\r\nmuch we were like them.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing how we killed the seals, it is not necessary to tell you how\r\nthe savages managed; and catching the walrus was just the same, only\r\nmore difficult, for a walrus is several times larger than a seal. You\r\nknow the walrus are those huge marine animals, living in the Arctic\r\nseas, that have long white tusks, and look so fierce. They make a very\r\nloud and very hideous noise; and in the summer, like the seals, they\r\ncome up on the ice, or on the rocks along the shore, in great numbers,\r\nto bask and sleep in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough to say there was a great deal of sport, and a great deal\r\nof excitement, not unmixed with danger. One of the hunters got a line\r\ntangled about his legs, and was whipped over into the water, where he\r\nwas not noticed, except to be laughed at, while all the hunters went on\r\nwith what they were about, letting him shift for himself,--little\r\ncaring, as it appeared, whether he drowned or not; and I really believe\r\nhe would have drowned, had it not been for the assistance of the Dean\r\nand myself. This was the first time I had observed how reckless these\r\npeople were of their lives.\r\n\r\n\"There were in the party altogether nine sledges, with one good hunter\r\nto each sledge. Five of them were old men and four were young men,\r\nbesides which there were six boys of various ages; and these, with the\r\nDean and myself, made seventeen. By helping each other all round, we\r\ncaught seven seals and three walruses,--all of which we skinned and\r\nquartered, and put on the sledges; and then we returned to the\r\nvillage,--walking back, however, as the load on the sledges was too\r\nheavy to allow us to ride.\r\n\r\n\"When we reached the village, the women came out to meet us, talking\r\nvery much, and _yeh, yeh_-ing louder than ever; and now I observed that\r\nthey took all the game we had captured, and butchered it, the men doing\r\nnothing at all but look after their dogs. It was thought to be a\r\ndisgrace for a man to do any work about his hut.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean and I had taken our full share in the hunt, and won much\r\nadmiration. Before, they had treated us with a kind of pity, but now\r\nthey had great respect for us. Eatum said, 'Much good hunter you.'\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that we were good hunters, they were now going to marry us right\r\noff, that we might have wives to cut up our seals when we brought them\r\nhome, which proposition put us in a great embarrassment. If we refused,\r\nthey might be offended, as was very natural; so I accepted their offer\r\nat once without a moment's hesitation, appearing as if I was very glad,\r\nand thought it a great compliment indeed; but at the same time I told\r\nthem, with a very grave face, that all our relations lived in a far-off\r\ncountry, to which we were obliged to go as soon as a ship came that way;\r\nand, of course, when we did go, the wives they gave us would go along.\r\nAs none of the young women were willing to take us on these conditions,\r\nalthough not very flattering to us, we got out of the difficulty without\r\noffending anybody. At first the Dean was quite indignant, but afterwards\r\nhe laughed, and said, 'Why, just think of it! Mrs. Hardy and Mrs. Dean\r\nin seal-skin breeches and long boots,--a jolly idea indeed!' But one of\r\nthe girls was fond enough of the Dean for all, only she mustn't show it;\r\nfor these people are mighty particular about that. When all is arranged\r\nby the parents, the girl is obliged, even then, to say she won't have\r\nher lover. So the lover has to steal up, and take her unawares, and run\r\noff with her bodily. Of coarse, if she really likes the fellow, and\r\nwants to get married to him, he has an easy time enough of it; but if,\r\non the other hand, she dislikes him, she can readily get away from him.\r\n\r\n\"Old Grim (whose right name was Metak, meaning eider-duck) had an\r\nadventure of this sort, as they told me, which resulted very differently\r\nfrom what usually happens. He was then quite a young man, but, having\r\ncaught a seal, he thought it was time he had a wife. Meanwhile a wife\r\nhad been provided for him by his father, who had made the bargain with\r\nthe girl's father. The girl was told who her husband was to be, but it\r\nwould have been against all rules to tell her when he was coming after\r\nher. Well, as I have said, having caught his first seal, Metak made up\r\nhis mind to have a wife to butcher it for him; so he set out for the\r\nsnow hut of his lady-love's father, where the dusky-faced girl was lying\r\nfast asleep, all rolled up in furs.\r\n\r\n\"As it was contrary to custom for any girl to be captured in a hut, but\r\nmust be taken on the wing, as it were, Metak had to wait for her to come\r\nout, which she finally did, and passed very near a deep bank of snow,\r\nbehind which her lover was lying, shivering with cold, and crying with\r\nimpatience. Quick as a fox to pounce upon an unsuspecting rabbit was\r\nMetak to pounce upon the unsuspecting girl. He seized her, and started\r\nfor his sledge. She screamed, she pulled his hair, she tore his fur, she\r\nbit his fingers; but the valiant Metak held manfully to his purpose, and\r\nwould not let her go. He reached the sledge, and put her on it; he tied\r\nher there, and, springing on himself, he whipped up his dogs, and\r\nstarted for his home. But the refractory damsel would not stay tied. She\r\ncut the lashings with her teeth, she seized the whip out of Metak's\r\nhands, she pushed Metak off the sledge, and sent him sprawling on the\r\nsnow; and then she wheeled the dogs around, and fairly made them fly\r\nagain on the backward track to her father's hut, where she crawled once\r\nmore into her nest of furs, and where the luckless Metak was ever\r\nafterwards content to let her stay, satisfied that he was no match for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"This story was told by Eatum one evening in the snow hut, while Old\r\nGrim was present, and it was evidently a standing joke against him. He\r\ndid not seem to relish it at all, for he went out of the hut as if\r\ndriven away by their shouts of laughter. I could not understand the\r\nlanguage well enough to fully appreciate the story at the time, but\r\nafterward I got Eatum to repeat it to me.\r\n\r\n\"It proved that the name Old Grim, that the Dean and I had given Metak,\r\nwas even more appropriate than we thought; for it seemed that he was\r\ngenerally known as the man who laughed with his insides without the help\r\nof his face.\r\n\r\n\"Altogether these savages were a most singular people. They seemed to be\r\nhappy and cheerful all the time, never caring for anything, so long as\r\nthey had enough to eat, and plenty of time to tell stories about each\r\nother and make each other laugh. But what struck the Dean and I most\r\nstrangely was that they should be living in this happy state away out\r\nthere on the sea, a long distance from land, really burrowing in the\r\nsnow for shelter, and roaming about for food like beasts of prey, and\r\nyet enjoying themselves and amusing themselves after the fashion of\r\ncivilized human beings, so far as their relations to one another were\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I do declare,' said the Dean, 'this is an odd party, to be sure.\r\nI'm going to christen them, Hardy.'\r\n\r\n\"'Christen them, or Christian them'? I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Both, perhaps,' answered the Dean; 'but for the present I mean\r\nchristen,--that is, give them a name.'\r\n\r\n\"'That I understand; but what's the name?'\r\n\r\n\"'The Children of the Frozen Sea.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very good,' I said, 'capital! Children of the frozen sea! Sounds good,\r\nat any rate; and all the world is agreed that whatever sounds good must\r\nbe good.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nThe Peculiar People proving to be Savages, the Castaways\r\nseize the First Opportunity to leave them, not relishing\r\ntheir Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have not latterly said much about the Dean; but you may be very sure\r\nthat such a fine fellow could not fail to be greatly delighted with the\r\nchange that had come about, as it not only led us away from our desolate\r\nlife on the desert island, but gave us a promise at least of the rescue\r\nwhich we had so earnestly prayed for. 'We ought to be very thankful,'\r\nsaid the Dean to me one day, 'very thankful indeed for this\r\ndeliverance.' But as I did not much relish the habits and customs of the\r\nsavages, I did not find myself of the same thankful disposition; so I\r\nreplied to the Dean, that the change looked much like that of the fish\r\nwho fell out of the frying-pan into the fire. 'You should not say so,'\r\nreplied the Dean. 'I see the hand of God in it; and he who has\r\nmercifully preserved us through so many trials and dangers will not\r\ndesert us now.'\r\n\r\n\"The Dean said no more at that time, but he became very thoughtful,\r\nwhile, as for myself, I felt quite ashamed that I had spoken so\r\nslightingly of the savages, and had shown so much impatience with their\r\nrather disagreeable company; for, to tell the truth, their ways were\r\nsomewhat offensive, as they never washed their faces, and were\r\naltogether rather a filthy set.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean, however, did not stop with preaching about them, but, on the\r\ncontrary, did everything he could for them. One of the hunters had gone\r\nto catch seals, and, the ice breaking up, he was drifted out to sea,\r\nwhere he took refuge on an iceberg, upon which he managed to drag his\r\ndogs and sledge. Here he lived through terrible storms and cold for a\r\nwhole moon (that being the way they reckon time), and he only escaped\r\nfinally by the iceberg drifting in near the land, when the sea froze\r\naround it. After great trouble he got ashore, with both of his feet\r\ndreadfully frozen, which is easily accounted for when you know that the\r\npoor fellow had no shelter at all while on the iceberg, and had nothing\r\nto eat but his dogs, all of which died of starvation. This savage had no\r\nwife, and the Dean took care of him, and dressed his frost-bites, and\r\nwas so good to him that the savages all called him '_Paw-weit_', which\r\nmeans 'Little Good-heart.' So the Dean got on famously; but the poor\r\nfrozen savage that he had been so kind to died at last, and was buried\r\nin the snow.\r\n\r\n\"A child fell on the ice, and broke its arm, and the Dean set it, and\r\nmade it all right; and to other people he did many things to show his\r\nsympathy for them; but, when he began to tell them about our religion,\r\nthey did not understand him, and had no mind to listen. This very much\r\ngrieved the Dean; for he wanted to convert the whole of them, and\r\nthought, if he only knew their language better, he could persuade them\r\nall to be Christians,--which I think very likely, for nobody could\r\nresist him.\r\n\r\n\"We remained at the snow village three weeks, but we did not do much\r\nmore hunting, as the savages seemed to think they had enough for their\r\npresent wants; and since they are almost constantly moving about from\r\nplace to place in search of food, they never store up much for the\r\nfuture. Having enough to eat for the present, they let the future take\r\ncare of itself; and, sure of a good meal, they amuse themselves mostly\r\nwith telling stories, usually about each other,--that is, when they are\r\nnot eating or sleeping, which I must say occupies most of their time.\r\n\r\n\"They had a singular custom in their story-telling which I have never\r\nseen among any other people. One person recites the story, and the\r\nlisteners break in, every now and then, with a laughing chorus that is\r\nnothing more than a repetition of the meaningless words, '_amna aya_',\r\nwhich are sung over and over to any extent. The women generally enjoy it\r\nthe most, and sing the loudest, especially when a man is concerned. I\r\nwill give you a specimen of this kind of song,--translated, of course,\r\nas I have long ago forgotten how to speak their language.\r\n\r\n\"Eatum is telling the story of a bear-hunt, and as you will see that it\r\nis a kind of song, I will sing it for you, and you can join in the\r\nchorus just as well as if you were all little savages yourselves. We\r\nwill call it\r\n\r\n       \"THE SONG OF KARSUK'S BEAR-HUNT.\r\n\r\n    \"A bear is seen upon the ice,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    Karsuk goes out to hunt the bear,\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_,\r\n\r\n    \"The dogs get quick upon the trail,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    The dogs are pulling all they can,\r\n      _Amna, amna, aya_.\r\n\r\n    \"The bear is running all he can,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    The bear gets tired and cannot run,\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_.\r\n\r\n    \"He turns around to charge Karsuk,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    Karsuk jumps off and runs away,\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_,\r\n\r\n    \"He runs away all full of fright,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    So full of fright he tumbles down,\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_,\r\n\r\n    \"Bear kills the dogs and breaks the sledge,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n    What girl will marry such a man?\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_.\"\r\n\r\nand so on, after that, they keep _aya_-ing, _aya_-ing, and\r\n_amna-aya_-ing uproariously, until they are entirely broken down with\r\nshouting and laughing, in the midst of which Karsuk is pretty sure to\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\n\"In the same manner I have heard the story of Metak's love adventure\r\nsung, or rather recited, or _amna-aya_-ed as one might say.\r\n\r\n\"They use the same _amna-aya_ chorus when they sing over the dead, or\r\nsing praises of the dead, only instead of being lively, then it is sung\r\nin a solemn tone. I will repeat one called\r\n\r\n       \"THE GRAVE-SONG OF MERAKUT.\r\n\r\n    \"Merakut, Merakut, Merakut dead!\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n\r\n    Merakut dead, her lamp is smoking,\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_.\r\n\r\n    Her children are crying, her baby is freezing,\r\n      _Amna aya_;\r\n\r\n    O, her hut and our hearts are all cold!\r\n      _Amna, amna aya_.\"\r\n\r\nand after that, as in the other song, they keep on _amna-aya_-ing for a\r\nlong while, but with a very doleful voice and manner. Indeed, it is\r\nquite as distressing to hear them _amna-aya_ the dead as it is amusing\r\nto hear them _amna-aya_ the living.\r\n\r\n\"The Dean and I very much wanted to go on another bear-hunt, but the\r\nsavages said it was too late in the season for that, as the ice had many\r\ncracks in it, and there was no use chasing a bear, as he would jump into\r\nthe first crack he came to, and swim over it to the other side, and\r\nthere he would be safe enough. And, indeed, when I climbed one day to\r\nthe top of a tall iceberg, and looked out in the direction of our\r\nsolitary island, I could see several cracks from a yard to a hundred\r\nyards wide, so that it was very fortunate we escaped from the island\r\nwhen we did.\r\n\r\n\"The savages now said it was time to be moving, or a crack might come\r\nbetween us and the shore. Indeed, the season was getting well advanced;\r\nthe snow was melting a little, and in places it was quite sloppy; so\r\neverything in and about the snow huts was packed upon the sledges, and\r\nwe went then to the main-land, which was not more than ten miles\r\ndistant. Here we came upon a village of three huts, built in the\r\nhillside very near the sea, and were in many respects fitted up as our\r\nown had been; only they had regularly constructed walls of stones and\r\nturf, which, tapering in from either side, joined at the top, making a\r\nspace large enough to accommodate two or three families in each hut.\r\nInto these three huts were crowded all the men, women, and children that\r\nhad been in the snow village.\r\n\r\n\"There we lived five days, after which we took up our march again,\r\nkeeping along near the shore, where the ice was most solid and safe.\r\nThen we came to a deep, broad bay where the hillside, which was exposed\r\nto the south, was quite free of snow,--the snow having melted and run\r\ndown to the sea. Here we halted, and the savages went to some great\r\npiles of stones, and brought out from under them a number of seal-skins,\r\nwhich were spread over some narwhal horns that were just like 'Old\r\nCrumply,' and in a few hours they had pitched two tents, under which we\r\nall slept soundly, being very tired. The next day they got more\r\nseal-skins, and pitched three more tents, and a few days afterward other\r\npeople came along, and put up two other tents, making in all\r\nseven,--quite a little seal-skin village, and a much more comfortable\r\nlooking one than the snow village had been.\r\n\r\n\"Here it seemed to be the intention of the savages to remain for some\r\ntime, as they went regularly to work to prepare for hunting various\r\nkinds of game, chiefly walruses and seals, and besides these, among\r\nothers, an animal I had not seen before,--a beautiful rabbit, or hare\r\nrather, very large, and pure white. These were quite numerous, and fed\r\nupon the buds and bark of the willow-bushes, and were caught by\r\nstretching a very long line across the tops of a great number of stones,\r\nor piles of stones rather, which were placed about six feet apart, the\r\nline itself being about a foot from the ground. To this line they tied a\r\ngreat number of loops, and then all the people, going out, surrounded\r\nthe rabbits and drove them under the line, and several of them found\r\nthemselves noosed when they least expected it. I saw there also a\r\nbeautiful white bird called a ptarmigan, which is a grouse, but it could\r\nnot be caught.\r\n\r\n\"By this time we had become quite domesticated among the savages. They\r\ncalled me _Annorak_, which meant that I resembled the wind when I\r\ntalked,--that is, I talked when I liked and where I liked, and nothing\r\ncould stop me, while the Dean was much more sober. Him they finally\r\ncalled _Aupadleit_, which means 'Little Red-head,' though the Dean's\r\nhair was not exactly red, but very bright, and the savages admired it\r\nvery much; so the Dean, to humor them, cut off great locks of it, and\r\ngave it to them all round.\r\n\r\n\"I took a great interest in Eatum's children, and this further inclined\r\nMr. and Mrs. Eatum to have a good opinion of me. As they were people of\r\nmuch consequence in their tribe, this was a matter of great importance;\r\nand, in truth, the juvenile Eatums were quite an interesting pair of\r\nsavages, and were fond of play like any other children. One was a boy\r\nand the other a girl. I cannot remember their right names, but the Dean\r\nand I christened the boy _Mop-head_, because of the great quantity of\r\ndirty black hair he had, and the girl we called _Gimlet-eyes_. Mop-head\r\nhad a little sledge made of bones, just like his father's; and with this\r\nthe two children used to play at travelling and other games. Gimlet-eyes\r\nhad little dolls carved out of bones, which she used to dress up in furs\r\nand put on the sledge for Mop-head to drag when they went on their\r\njourneys; and he had little spears, and she had little pots and lamps,\r\nand they used to make excursions over the snow that you could hardly\r\nthrow a stone to the end of; and then they would build little snow\r\nhouses and put the dolls in them, and, while Mop-head went off to hunt,\r\nGimlet-eyes would _amna-aya_ them to sleep. Thus you see little children\r\nare much alike all the world over.\r\n\r\n\"In these playful exercises we used to amuse ourselves with the\r\nchildren; and when we were travelling about in earnest, the Dean and I\r\nsometimes pulled Mop-head's little sledge for him, when we were going\r\nslow: and he thought it great fun to have the white-faced strangers\r\ndrag his sister's lamps and pots and dolls along.\r\n\r\n\"And now the summer was fairly come. The snow was melting very rapidly,\r\nand first in small and then in large streams the water came rushing and\r\nroaring down into the sea. The birds soon afterward came back from the\r\nsouth,--the eider-ducks and the little auks, which we had caught in the\r\nsummer time when upon the island; and then, as soon as the snow was all\r\ngone, the moss and stunted grass grew green, and plants sprouted up here\r\nand there, and the butterflies with bright yellow wings went gathering\r\nthe honey from flower to flower, and you cannot imagine how glad we were\r\nonce more to come out of the dreary winter into this bright sunshine and\r\nthis pleasant summer.\r\n\r\n\"It was apparent now why the savages had gone to this place. The little\r\nauks came in great numbers, and these birds I was told formed their\r\nprincipal subsistence in the summer season; indeed sometimes this is\r\ntheir only kind of food. There must have been millions on millions of\r\nthem, swarming there like bees, and they made their nests among the\r\nstones on the hillside. The savages caught them as we had done, in nets.\r\nThere were some reindeer, but these were not often caught. The reindeer\r\nhere run wild, and are not as in Lapland tamed and taught to draw\r\nsledges. When the savages went on this kind of hunting, two always went\r\ntogether, walking so close, one behind the other, as to appear like one\r\nman. As soon as the deer saw the hunters, the latter would turn round\r\nand go back the other way, and the deer, being very curious, would\r\nfollow them. Thus a deer may sometimes be enticed a long distance, and\r\nif through a narrow defile, there is then a chance of catching him; for\r\none of the hunters drops down suddenly behind a rock, while the other\r\ngoes on as if nothing had happened. The deer, thus cheated, keeps\r\nfollowing the single hunter, where he had before followed a double one\r\nall unknown to himself, and at length approaches very near to the hunter\r\nlying behind the rock. As soon as the deer comes within a few yards of\r\nhim, this concealed hunter rises, and throws his harpoon, the line of\r\nwhich he has previously made fast to a heavy stone. If fortunate enough\r\nto hit the deer, and the harpoon to hold, the animal is easily killed by\r\nthe two hunters, who attack it with their spears.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the birds that I have told you of, there came a great many\r\nsnipes, and different varieties of sea-gulls, and ducks of various\r\nspecies, and gerfalcons, and ravens,--also some little sparrows.\r\n\r\n\"I was very desirous to know how they managed to make their harpoon and\r\nspear heads, as I observed that they were all tipped with iron. So one\r\nday they took us over to a place they call _Savisavick_, which means\r\n'The Iron Place,'--the name being derived from a large block of meteoric\r\niron, from which the savages chipped small scales; and these were set in\r\nthe edges and tips of their harpoon and spear heads, just as I had done\r\nwith my brass buttons. They also made knives in the same way. Many of\r\ntheir spear-handles were nothing more than narwhal horns, just like 'Old\r\nCrumply'; and so you see how the Lord provides for all his creatures,\r\nendowing them all, whether white or black or copper-colored, with the\r\nsame instinct of self-preservation, which leads them to seek and obtain\r\nfor the security of their lives the materials that He places within\r\ntheir reach. How beautiful are all His works! and how constantly He\r\nwatches over the rich and the poor, the savage and the Christian, the\r\njust and the unjust alike!\r\n\r\n\"Thus occupied, we drifted on into the final week of July. There was\r\nscarcely any snow left on the hillsides by this time; the air was filled\r\nwith the incessant cry of birds and the constant plash of falling\r\nwaters. We could sleep well enough once more on the green grass in the\r\nopen air; and another period of watching now began, for here it was that\r\nthe vessels passed every year, as the savages told us. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, they did not stop; but, when the ships appeared, the savages\r\nalways went to a valley facing the sea, from one side of which the snow\r\nnever melted, and, running to and fro over the white snow, endeavored to\r\nattract the attention of the people on the ships.\r\n\r\n\"We were much alarmed to find the ice holding firmly along the shore;\r\nand, as far away as the eye could reach, there was not much water to be\r\nseen. At last, however, a strong wind came, and started the ice. Some\r\ncracks were soon opened, and then a long lead or lane of water was seen\r\nstretching away to the south, and running close in by the land.\r\n\r\n\"The savages said that the _Oomeaksuaks_ (big ships) would come very\r\nsoon now, if at all; so we watched very carefully for them. The Dean and\r\nI did not hunt any more, as the savages, seeing how anxious we were, and\r\nhow our hearts yearned for our own homes and kindred, provided us with\r\nfood in abundance; and, besides this, they sent some of their women and\r\nyoung lads to aid us in looking out for the ships.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the time wore on, and we were becoming very fearful that the ships\r\nwould not come at all. This was a dreadful thought to us, for, although\r\nthe savages were very obliging, yet we looked forward with great dread\r\nto living long with them. Besides this and our longing to get home, we\r\nhad had quite enough of this cold, desolate part of the world, where the\r\nsun never sets in summer nor rises in winter.\r\n\r\n\"While reflecting in this way, we heard one of the savages cry out\r\n'_Oomeaksuak, Oomeaksuak!_' several times; and, running a little higher\r\nup the hillside whence the cry proceeded, our eyes were gladdened by\r\nseeing far off, with the hull yet hidden below the horizon, a ship under\r\nfull sail, steering northward. At first the Dean, who had been so often\r\ncheated, thought it might be an iceberg; but it was clearly a ship that\r\nwe saw this time. From fear that it might be an iceberg, we passed now\r\nto fear that it might hold off from the land, and not discover us, which\r\nwould be even harder to bear.\r\n\r\n\"By and by the hull of the ship was plainly to be seen, and after a\r\nwhile we discovered that the ship was not alone, but that another was\r\nfollowing only a few miles behind it; and directly two more were seen,\r\nmaking four, and then a fifth hove in sight some hours afterward. We\r\nknew this must be part of a whaling fleet that annually visits the\r\nArctic seas, and we rejoiced greatly at the prospect of our deliverance.\r\n\r\n\"You will see how fortunate it was for us that there were so many of\r\nthese ships; for, as we had feared, the first ship held so far away from\r\nthe land that it was hopeless to think of being seen from her. But the\r\nlead through which this first ship had sailed off from the land was\r\nclosed up before the others could enter it; and now these other ships\r\nwere forced to come nearer to us. Seeing this, we hastened to the white\r\nhillside I have spoken of before, all the savages accompanying us, and\r\nwe all began running up and down; but the next ship was still too far\r\naway to discover us. And the same with another and still another. Thus\r\nhad four ships gone by without any soul on board being aware that two\r\npoor shipwrecked boys were so near, calling to them, and praying with\r\nall their might that they might see or hear.\r\n\r\n\"But there was yet a fifth ship, a long way behind all the others, and\r\nwe still had hope. If this failed us, all was over, and we must be\r\ncontent to live with the savages. We had observed one thing which gave\r\nus great encouragement. Each ship that had passed us came a little\r\nnearer to the land; and this we saw was in consequence of the ice\r\ndrifting steadily in before the wind. Indeed, by the time the last ship\r\ncame along, the ice had pushed in ahead of her, and had touched the\r\nland, while the other ships had run through just in time.\r\n\r\n\"When the people on board saw what was ahead of them, and that they\r\ncould not pass, they tacked ship, and stood away from us; but we saw\r\nclearly enough, from our elevated position on the hill, that they were\r\nnot likely to get through in that direction,--which was, no doubt, a\r\nmuch more pleasant thing for us than for the people on board. This\r\nproved true; for presently they tacked again, and stood straight in\r\ntowards where we were standing. Coming very near the shore, we did\r\neverything we could to attract their attention. We shouted as loud as we\r\ncould, we threw up our caps and waved them round our heads, and we ran\r\nto and fro, all the savages doing the same.\r\n\r\n\"O how excited we became! almost frantic, indeed. A ship so near and yet\r\nso far away! Four ships gone by and out of sight! Those on board the\r\nfifth and last unconscious of our presence on the desolate shore; and\r\nhow could we make the people see us? I cannot tell you what anxious\r\nmoments these were during which we watched the ship as she came nearer\r\nand nearer to where we stood.\r\n\r\n\"At length she is so near that we can see the people on the deck; why\r\ncan they not see us?\r\n\r\n\"The sails are shivering; the ship is coming to the wind! Have they\r\nseen us? are they heaving the vessel to? will they send a boat ashore to\r\nfetch us off?\r\n\r\n\"We hear the creaking of the blocks; the yards are swinging round; the\r\nbraces are hauled taut; the other tack is aboard; they are _not_ heaving\r\nto!\r\n\r\n\"The vessel fills away again; the sails are bulging out; the vessel\r\ndrives ahead; they have not seen us!\r\n\r\n\"Shout again! Up and down, up and down, once more across the\r\nsnow,--shout! shout all in chorus! but it is of no use.\r\n\r\n\"The bows fall off; the vessel turns back upon her course. Where is she\r\ngoing now? is she homeward bound?\r\n\r\n\"O no! she steers for the land; she nears it; she passes beyond a point\r\nbelow us, and is out of sight! Where has she gone?\r\n\r\n\"We follow after her, hurrying all we can. Miles of rough travelling\r\nover rocks and through deep gorges,--climbing down one side and up the\r\nother. The savages are with us.\r\n\r\n\"What is our hope? It is that the vessel, failing to get through the\r\nice, has sought the land for shelter, and will find an anchorage and\r\nthere remain until the ice opens ahead, and gives the ship once more a\r\nchance to go upon her course.\r\n\r\n\"Soon we round a lofty cliff that rises almost squarely from the sea,\r\nwith only a narrow, rugged track between it and the water, and we come\r\nupon a narrow bay. A little farther, and there the vessel lies before\r\nus,--quietly at anchor, with her sails all furled.\r\n\r\n\"Again we see the men upon the deck,--faintly, but still we see them.\r\n\r\n\"Again we shout.\r\n\r\n\"We see a man halting by the bulwarks; something glitters in his hand.\r\nIs it a spyglass?\r\n\r\n\"No; he moves away.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a man mounting to the mizen cross-trees?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a man.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a spyglass glittering in his hand? Yes, surely it must be.\r\n\r\n\"He waves his cap; he shouts to the people on deck; he descends; all is\r\nbustle in the ship; a boat is lowered to the water; men spring into it;\r\nthe oars are dipped; the men give way; the boat heads for the spot where\r\nwe are standing; we are discovered! O, God be praised! at last, at last!\r\n\r\n\"The boat cuts through the water quickly; it nears us; again we see\r\nwhite human faces; again we hear human speech in a familiar tongue.\r\n\r\n\"'In oars!'--the boat touches the rocks, and we are there to take the\r\npainter, and to make her fast.\r\n\r\n\"Two of the men spring out; a man rises in the stern; he shades his eyes\r\nwith his hands, as if to protect them from the glaring sun, and stares\r\nat us, and then at the savages, who--of both sexes, and of every age and\r\nsize--surround us. Then he calls out, 'Is there a white man in that\r\ncrowd?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir; two of them.'\r\n\r\n\"'I thought so from the motions,' says the man. Then he stared at me\r\nagain, and cried: 'Is that the lubber Hardy, of the _Blackbird_?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir; it is,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'Is that other chap the cabin-boy?--him they called the Dean?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir,' spoke up the Dean.\r\n\r\n\"In an instant the man was out upon the rocks, and he grasped us warmly\r\nby the hands. He had recognized us, now we recognized _him_. He was the\r\nmaster of a ship that lay alongside the _Blackbird_ when we first went\r\namong the ice, catching seals. His ship was the _Rob Roy_, of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n\"This much he said to quiet us, for he saw the state of agitation we\r\nwere in. Then he went on to tell us that the _Blackbird_, not having\r\nbeen heard from in all this time, it was thought that she must have gone\r\ndown somewhere among the ice, with all on board; and he told us further,\r\nthat he was on a whaling voyage now, and then he said, 'The _Rob Roy_\r\nwill give you a bonny welcome, lads.'\r\n\r\n\"Afterward he told us that the vessels were, as we had supposed, a part\r\nof the whaling fleet, and he said it was fortunate that he had\r\ndiscovered us, as this was our only chance, for all the other vessels\r\nthat were following him would be very likely, on account of the state of\r\nthe ice, to hold to the westward, and not come near the land.\r\n\r\n\"All this time the savages were _yeh-yeh_-ing round us, greatly to the\r\namusement of the captain of the _Rob Roy_ and his boat's crew. Then,\r\nwhen I told the captain how good they had been to us, he sent his boat\r\nback to the ship, and had fetched for them wood and knives and iron and\r\nneedles, in such great abundance that they set up a _yeh, yeh_, in\r\nconsequence, which, for anything I know to the contrary, may be going on\r\neven to this present time.\r\n\r\n\"But what was the happiness of the savages compared to ours? Our\r\nfeelings cannot be described. It seemed almost as if we had come from\r\ndeath to life. We could hardly believe our eyes,--that this was the ship\r\nwe had so long hoped for, this the rescue we had so often despaired of.\r\nWe cried with very joy, and behaved like two crazy people. The captain\r\nof the _Rob Roy_ laughed good-naturedly at us, and proposed at once to\r\nhurry us off aboard his ship.\r\n\r\n\"We kept our promise to give Eatum all our property; but the captain of\r\nthe _Rob Roy_ wanted 'Old Crumply' and 'The Dean's Delight,' and our pot\r\nand lamp, and some other things; so he gave Eatum other valuables in\r\nplace of them. Then we took leave of our savage friends, which we of\r\ncourse did not do without some feelings of sorrow and regret at parting\r\nfrom them, remembering as we did how kind they had been to us, and how\r\nthey had rescued us from our unhappy situation; and the savages seemed a\r\nlittle sorry too. First came Eatum and Mrs. Eatum, and then the two\r\nlittle Eatums (Mop-head and Gimlet-eyes) that I had so often played\r\nwith; then Old Grim and Big-toes and Little-nose; and Awak, the walrus,\r\nand Kossuit; and the two young ladies who might have been our wives: and\r\nthen all the rest of them, big and little, old and young.\r\n\r\n\"Then off we went to the _Rob Roy_; and a fair wind coming soon, the ice\r\nbegan to move away from the land, the Rob Roy's sails were unfurled to\r\nthe fresh breeze, and now, with hearts turned thankfully to Heaven for\r\nour deliverance, we were again afloat upon the blue water,--whither\r\nbound we did not know, but _homeward_ in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, how glad you must have been!\" said Fred.\r\n\r\n\"How splendidly the rescue and all that comes round,\" said William;\r\n\"just like it does in all the printed books. Why, Captain Hardy, it\r\ncouldn't have been better if you'd made the story up, it looks so\r\n_real_!\"\r\n\r\nWhile, as for little Alice, she never said a word, but only looked upon\r\nthe old man wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBrings the Holidays of the Little People and the Story\r\nof the Old Man to an End.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the Mariner's Rest receives the little people; again the Ancient\r\nMariner is there to welcome them. But a shade of sadness is upon the old\r\nman's face, and the children are not so gay as is their wont; for all\r\nthings must have an end, and holidays are no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it too bad,\" said William, looking very sober,--\"isn't it too bad\r\nthat this is to be the last of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad for you as for me,\" replied the Ancient Mariner; and the old\r\nman looked as gloomy and forsaken as if he had been cast away in the\r\ncold again. But he soon cheered up, and in a much livelier way he said,\r\n\"Well now, my hearties, since this is to be the last of it, suppose we\r\nclose the story in the 'Crow's Nest,' where we first began it; for you\r\nsee, if the Dean and I were rescued from the desolate island and the\r\nsavages, we were not home yet. Now, what do you say to that, my dears?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Crow's Nest! Yes, yes, the Crow's Nest!\" cried the children all at\r\nonce; and away they scampered to it, as light and merry as if they had\r\nnever for an instant been sad at thought of the parting that was so soon\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nAnd now once more our little party are together in the dear old rustic\r\nvine-clad arbor, and, as on the first day of meeting there, the old man\r\ntakes his long clay pipe out of his mouth, and sticks it in a rafter\r\noverhead; then around little Alice he puts his great, big arm, and he\r\ndraws the fair-haired, bright-eyed child close to his side, and thus\r\n\"ballasted,\" as he says, he \"bears away for port.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Now, to bring our story to an end,\" ran on the Captain, \"I must say\r\nfirst that the _Rob Roy_ was a good, stout ship; the master a bluff,\r\ngood-hearted Scotchman; the mate a kindly man, and altogether different\r\nfrom the red-faced mate that was on the _Blackbird_; and the people were\r\nall just as good and kind to us as the savages had been. But they gave\r\nus right away so much coffee and ship's biscuit and other things to eat\r\nand drink (none of which had we tasted for three years and more), that\r\nwe got a dreadful colic, and had like to have died. But the next day we\r\nwere quite well again, and then we related to the Captain and everybody\r\non board the story of our adventures. The worst was, they would make us\r\ntell our story over and over again, as I have been telling it to you,\r\nuntil we almost wished we had never been rescued at all. It is, indeed,\r\na fearful thing in anybody's life ever to have met with any adventure\r\nthat is at all peculiar; for to the end of his days people will never\r\nget done asking him about it; and most likely their questions are of the\r\nmost ridiculous kind, like, 'Hardy, wasn't it cold there?' just as if\r\nanybody could be cast away in the cold, and find it anything else; or,\r\n'How did you feel, Hardy?' as if _feeling_ has anything at all to do\r\nwith you when you are trying to save your life.\r\n\r\n\"The captain of the _Rob Roy_ took a great fancy to our odd-looking fur\r\nclothes, especially our underclothing, which was made of birds' skins;\r\nand he gave us civilized garments out of the ship's stores. You may be\r\nsure that we were glad enough to get these nasty fur clothes off, and\r\nbe rid of them forever. The captain offered to keep them for us, but we\r\nsaid 'No, no,' for we had had quite enough of them.\r\n\r\n\"So we went after whales, and made a 'good catch,' as the whale-fishers\r\ncall a good shipload of oil, and then we bore away for Aberdeen, only\r\nstopping on the way at two or three half-savage places.\r\n\r\n\"When we reached Aberdeen, which occurred on the 29th of October, there\r\nwas a great talk made about us, and, when we walked through the streets,\r\npeople stuck out their fingers, and said, 'There they go! look!' so we\r\nwere great lions there, and had to tell our story so often that we found\r\nout what they liked most to hear, and this we repeated over and over\r\nagain; and by this method we saved much time and talk.\r\n\r\n\"The very first thing the Dean did, after landing, was to write a letter\r\nto his mother, sending it off right away by post. It was just like the\r\nlittle fellow to do it, and what he wrote was like him too. It began\r\nthus: 'Through the mercy of Providence I have been saved, and am coming\r\nback to you, mother dear.'\r\n\r\n\"Then we were shipped on board an American vessel, by the American\r\nConsul, for New York, where we arrived after a prosperous voyage, in\r\ngood health, and without anything happening to us worth mentioning. This\r\nwas on the 22d day of December, which made just three years, nine\r\nmonths, and nineteen days since we sailed from New Bedford.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we had landed, we set out for the hospital to find the\r\nDean's mother. The Dean had directed his letter there, thinking that if\r\nshe had got well and gone away, they would know where; and this they\r\ndid, so we took down the address and hurried on. It was in a little\r\nby-street, and we had much trouble to find it; but by and by we came\r\nupon a tumble-down old house, and were shown into a little tumble-down\r\nold room, with a tumble-down old bed in it, and a tumble-down box for a\r\nchair, and a small tumble-down table, and right in the middle of the\r\nfloor stood a little woman that was more tumble-down than all. It was\r\nthe Dean's poor mother. She stood beside a tub in which she had been\r\nwashing clothes, and she held a scrap of paper in both her hands, which,\r\nbony and hard with work, work, work, and scrub, scrub, scrub, were\r\ntrembling violently, while she tried to puzzle out the contents of the\r\nDean's letter (for this it was), that she held up before a face the deep\r\nwrinkles on which told of many sorrows and much suffering. The letter\r\nhad arrived only a few minutes before we did, and she had only just made\r\nout that it was from the Dean, and we could see that this had started\r\ngreat tears rolling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dean's Mother.]\r\n\r\n\"But there was no use to puzzle more now. There was her darling,\r\nbright-haired boy, whom she 'always felt sure,' she said, 'would come\r\nback again,'--never losing hope; and now you can imagine how she was not\r\nlong in recognizing him, and how she greeted him, and cried over him,\r\nand called him pretty names, and all that,--or, rather, I mean to say,\r\nyou can't imagine it at all, for I never saw the like of it. It seemed\r\nto me as if she would never let him go out of her arms again, for fear\r\nshe should lose him; and, seeing how matters stood, I went outside,\r\nwhere after a while the Dean joined me, and having some money in our\r\npockets, that we had earned on board the _Rob Roy_ and the American\r\npacket-ship, we went right off and bought the best supper we could get,\r\nand had it brought into the tumble-down room and spread out upon the\r\ntumble-down table; and never was any poor woman so glad in all the world\r\nas the Dean's mother, and never were any two boys so happy as the Dean\r\nand I. The Dean's mother would sometimes laugh for joy, and sometimes\r\ncry for the same excellent reason; and, when neither of these would do,\r\nnor both together even, she would fly at the Dean with open arms, and\r\nhug and kiss him until she was quite exhausted, and temporarily quieted\r\ndown. Meanwhile the Dean, besides eating his supper, was trying to tell\r\nhis mother what he had been doing all the time,--to neither of which\r\npurposes were these maternal interruptions peculiarly favorable.\r\n\r\n\"So now you see we were at home at last, safe in body and thankful in\r\nspirit. Transported with delight, we could hardly believe our senses.\r\nAfter so many years' absence, and such hardships and dangers as we had\r\npassed through, New York seemed like another world. So accustomed had we\r\nbeen to exposure that we could hardly sleep in-doors. The confined air\r\nof the house greatly troubled us. Everything we saw seemed new, and we\r\nwere in a constant state of wonder. We did not, however, forget the\r\nobligation we owed to our Heavenly Father for our deliverance; and we\r\nlost no time in going to a church, and there, in secret, we poured out\r\nour hearts to Him who rules the winds and the waves, and never forgets\r\nany of the creatures he has made.\r\n\r\n\"'And now,' said the Dean, 'I am going to further show my gratitude by\r\nmaking my mother comfortable for the rest of her days,'--which he did by\r\ngetting her into a better house, where she did not have to work any\r\nmore,--the Dean declaring that he would hereafter make all the money\r\nthat was necessary for her support; and he kept his word, too.\r\n\r\n\"As for the money the Dean had when we came home, that was soon all\r\ngone, and mine too, for that matter, since I helped the Dean, of course.\r\nThen we looked about us for a good ship to go to sea in, as we felt that\r\nwe should make better sailors now than anything else; indeed, neither of\r\nus knew what else to do.\r\n\r\n\"The story of our remarkable adventures getting abroad, we found many\r\nfriends, so you may be sure, when we shipped again, it was not in such a\r\ncrazy old hulk as the _Blackbird_, nor did we go any more whale or seal\r\nfishing, having got enough of that to last us during the remainder of\r\nour lives. Still, I have been back to the Arctic regions once since\r\nthen; but it was not with a red-faced mate to torment me.\r\n\r\n\"I did not feel like coming up to Rockdale yet, being very much ashamed,\r\nnot having made anything, as I could see, by running away. Besides, I\r\nlearned that my father had given me up for dead long ago, and had moved\r\nwith all my brothers and sisters to Ohio, where I wrote to him, telling\r\nall about my voyage and shipwreck,--the best I could, that is; for,\r\nhaving neglected my studies when at school, I could not write very well.\r\n\r\n\"So now I came to be a regular sailor, going away first with the Dean on\r\na voyage to the Mediterranean in a fine bark, where we got moderately\r\ngood wages, and, being both rather ambitious, we grew in favor and saved\r\nour money. When we returned, I proposed to the Dean that we should make\r\na common stock of our earnings, and get ourselves a nice little home,\r\nwhich we did; and remembering the Rock of Good Hope, we called it Good\r\nHope Cottage, of which the Dean's mother took possession, of course,\r\nwhile off we went to sea again, this time to Rio de Janeiro, in the same\r\nbark; then afterwards we went to the Mediterranean twice more, and on\r\nthe last voyage I got to be mate; and, afterward, when we stopped at\r\nBarcelona, the Dean was made second mate. Then, in course of time, the\r\nDean got to be a Captain, and prospered greatly, while his mother lived\r\nat Good Hope Cottage, and the Dean and I were always happy to come back\r\nand have a home like that to go to. After a while we were separated, for\r\nI was a Captain as well as the Dean, and we could no longer be together\r\nin the same ship; but still we both had a home together, and a place\r\nalways to hail from, you see.\r\n\r\n\"But I go too fast and too far. I must stop now, for I have given you\r\nthe story that I promised, of how I was _cast away in the cold_,--and it\r\nis high time too; for, as you have said, the holidays are at an end, and\r\nsee there! the sun is sinking down behind the trees, and once more, as\r\non the first day we met and parted in this pleasant little arbor, the\r\nshadows trail their ghostly length across the fields. But to me the\r\nshadows have another meaning now. They will lie there heavy on the\r\nground until you come to lift them, and I shall be very, very sad and\r\nlonely now without my little friends. The night is closing in, my dears,\r\nas if it were a curtain dropped purposely to hide what we would gladly\r\nsee again; and the dew is falling heavy on the grass, my dears, and so\r\n'good by' is the word.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Captain paused and bent his eyes upon the golden light that lay\r\nfar-off behind the trees, as if he would divine something of the future\r\nthat was before himself and the little children by his side, and which\r\nhe thought the golden sunlight held; but, while he looked, it seemed as\r\nif some tender chord within his gentle heart had snapped asunder and had\r\nbeen badly tied again, for he said quite hurriedly, \"Well, well, my\r\nhearties, we must pass the word, and get it over. Good by,--there it is!\r\nGod bless you, and good by!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good by, dear Captain Hardy,\" said William, putting out his hand,--a\r\nhand that promised to be a very manly one indeed some day,--\"good by,\r\nand thank you for all your goodness to us,\" and the little fellow could\r\nnot keep a tear from coming out upon his plump and rosy cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Good by,\" said Fred, and, as he said it, there were two tears at the\r\nvery least on his.\r\n\r\n\"Good by,\" dear little Alice would have said, though she didn't; but\r\ninstead she threw her arms about the old man's neck and kissed his\r\nsunburnt cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Good by,\" the Captain was about to say again, but (he was always good\r\nat getting out of scrapes) at that very moment he contracted a suspicion\r\nthat something moist was getting up into his own big hazel eyes; and so\r\nhe began to whistle briskly, and then to cry out, loud enough to call\r\nall hands to close reef the topsails in a gale of wind: \"Port and\r\nStarboard! Port and Starboard! come here, old curs and landlubbers that\r\nyou are,--come, bear a hand and be lively there, and say 'good by.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd along Port and Starboard came, bounding at a tremendous rate,\r\nbarking \"good by\" at every bound, and with their great bushy tails\r\nwagging \"good by\" besides.\r\n\r\nThe foreign ducks stopped shovelling and spattering mud, and quacked\r\n\"good by.\"\r\n\r\nThe chickens stopped stuffing themselves with grasshoppers, and, while\r\nthe hens cackled \"good by,\" the roosters crowed it.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, Main Brace came waddling along on his sausage legs, and\r\nfrom his plum-duff head let off \"good by\" at intervals, as a revolving\r\ngun lets off its balls, without appearing to have any more idea of what\r\nit was all about than the gun itself, until he reached the arbor, when\r\nhe broke out into a loud \"boo-hoo,\" which was the only \"good by\" he was\r\nnow equal to; and as the first \"boo-hoo\" let loose a second, and the\r\nsecond a third, and the third a deluge and an earthquake all in one,\r\nthere is no knowing what might have happened, had not the children\r\nscampered off and stopped the outburst,--Fred running on ahead, and\r\nWilliam following after, leading his sister Alice by the hand, while\r\nthe gentle little girl turned every dozen steps to throw back through\r\nthe tender evening air, from her dainty little fingertips, a loving\r\nkiss (there was no laughing now) to the Ancient Mariner, whose face\r\nbeamed brightly on her from the arbor door, and whose lips were saying\r\nplainly, \"Good by, and God bless you till you come again!\"",
