It\r\nis no more complicated than this.\r\n\r\nThat light, knowledge, good, and constructive men have had a small edge\r\nin this struggle is attested to by our slow rise over the long millennia\r\nof time. In taking stock of our successes, however, it is easy to assume\r\nthe victory has been won. Nothing could be further from the truth. This\r\nis a contest that is never ended, nor can it be, as long as men are upon\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nWhile man has free choice, the elements of darkness, ignorance, evil and\r\ndestruction are available for him to choose, and there are times when\r\nthese seem the best alternatives.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 18th century one of the greatest minds of all time was\r\ndestroyed by one stroke of a guillotine blade. The judge who presided at\r\nthe trial of the great French chemist Lavoisier is reported to have\r\nsaid, \"The Republic has no need of men of science.\"\r\n\r\nChoices like this have often been made by the society of man. A turnoff\r\nto darkness has been deliberately taken, superstition has been embraced\r\nwhile knowledge has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen times are placid we assume such choices could result only from some\r\ngreat insanity; that the men who made them had themselves known more\r\npleasant days. The truth is that there are extremes of circumstance\r\nwhich could force almost any man to abandon that which he has always\r\nheld to be right and good, and only the very giants could stand up and\r\nprove themselves unmoved.\r\n\r\nSuch giants may seem, in ordinary life, rather obscure. Illustrating\r\nthis are the people in this story: a somewhat pompous little mayor; a\r\nprofessor of chemistry in a small-town college in the mountain west; a\r\nminister of the gospel, who would be lost with a big-city congregation;\r\na sheriff who doesn't care what happens to him personally as long as he\r\nsticks to the kind of rightness that has always worked; and a\r\nhigh-school boy who learns what it means to do a man's work.\r\n\r\nSuch people are important, the most important people alive today. They\r\nare the ones whose hands hold all that our culture has achieved when\r\ncatastrophe overtakes us.\r\n\r\nThe illusion of security is a vicious one. With physical comforts around\r\nus, the abyss that is just beyond our walls is forgotten: the abyss of\r\nouter space, beyond the paper-thin atmosphere shielding us; of the fires\r\nin the earth beneath; of the hurricane winds beyond the horizon; of the\r\nevil and insanity in the minds of many men.\r\n\r\nThe caveman dared not forget these abysses, nor the frontiersman, nor\r\nthe scientist who fought the witch hunters to bring forth a new truth of\r\nNature. But when we believe we are secure we do forget them.\r\n\r\nIn catastrophe, the most recent achievements of the race are the first\r\nto go. When war comes, or mobs attack, or hurricanes strike, our science\r\nand our arts are abandoned first. Necessity of survival seems to insist\r\nthat we cannot fool with things of the mind and of the soul when\r\ndestruction threatens the body. And so, \"The Republic has no need of men\r\nof science.\"\r\n\r\nEmergency can take any form. Here is a story in which the mechanical\r\nfoundation of our culture is threatened. Whether the means of this\r\nthreat, as I have pictured it, could possibly occur, I do not know. I\r\nknow of no reason why it could not, if circumstances were right.\r\n\r\nBut more important, this is what happens to a small, college town caught\r\nup in such disaster. How quickly do its people dispense with their men\r\nof science and turn to superstition and mob rule for hope of survival?\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not so apparent to those of us who have grown up with it,\r\nbut we have witnessed in our own time, under threat of calamity, the\r\ndecline of science before a blight of crash-priority engineering\r\ntechnology. Today, we hear it faintly whispered, \"The Republic has no\r\nneed of men of science.\"\r\n\r\nInsofar as he represents the achievements of our race over the great\r\nreaches of time, the scientist will always be needed if we are to retain\r\nthe foothold we have gained over Nature. The witch doctors and the\r\nfortunetellers clamor for his niche and will gladly extend their\r\nservices if we wish to change our allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe story of THE YEAR WHEN STARDUST FELL is not a story of the distant\r\nfuture or of the remote past. It is not a story of a never-never land\r\nwhere fantastic happenings take place daily. It is a story of my town\r\nand yours, of people like you and me and the mayor in townhall, his\r\nsheriff on the corner, and the professor in the university--a story that\r\nhappens no later than tomorrow.\r\n\r\nR. F. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1. _The Comet_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comet was the only thing in the whole sky. All the stars were\r\nsmothered by the light of its copper-yellow flame, and, although the sun\r\nhad set two hours ago, the Earth was lit as with the glow of a\r\nthunderous dawn.\r\n\r\nIn Mayfield, Ken Maddox walked slowly along Main Street, avoiding\r\ncollisions with other people whose eyes were fixed on the object in the\r\nsky. Ken had spent scores of hours observing the comet carefully, both\r\nby naked eye and with his 12-inch reflecting telescope. Still he could\r\nnot keep from watching it as he picked his way along the street toward\r\nthe post office.\r\n\r\nThe comet had been approaching Earth for months, growing steadily to\r\nbigger proportions in the sky, but tonight was a very special night, and\r\nMayfield was watching with increased awe and half-dread--as were\r\nhundreds of thousands of other communities around the world.\r\n\r\nTonight, the Earth entered the comet's tail, and during the coming\r\nwinter would be swept continuously by its million-mile spread.\r\n\r\nThere was no visible change. The astronomers had cautioned that none was\r\nto be expected. The Earth had passed through the tails of comets\r\nbefore, although briefly, and none of the inhabitants had been\r\nphysically aware of the event.\r\n\r\nThis time there was a difference. As intangible as a mere suspicion, it\r\ncould yet be felt, and there was the expectancy of the unknown in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nKen prided himself on a scientific attitude, but it was hard not to\r\nshare the feelings of those around him that something momentous and\r\nmysterious was taking place this night. There would be no quick passage\r\nthis time. Earth would lie within the tail for a period of over four\r\nmonths as they both made their way about the sun.\r\n\r\nSuch close-lying orbits had never occurred before in the known history\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\"It's frightening, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nKen was aware that he had stopped at the edge of a crowd in front of\r\nBillings Drugstore, and beside him Maria Larsen was staring intently\r\nupward as she spoke.\r\n\r\nShe was a small, blonde girl with intense blue eyes. Ken smiled\r\nconfidently and looked down at her. \"No,\" he said. \"It's a beautiful\r\nthing. It's a kind of miracle that we should be alive when it happened.\r\nNo human beings have ever seen such a sight before.\"\r\n\r\nMaria shivered faintly. \"I wish I could feel that way. Do you think it\r\nwill get any bigger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It will not reach its closest approach for over three months, yet.\r\nIts approach is very slow so we won't notice much change.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is beautiful,\" Maria agreed slowly, \"but, still, it's frightening.\r\nI'll be glad when it's gone.\"\r\n\r\nKen laughed and tucked the girl's arm in his. There was something so\r\ndisturbingly serious about the Swedish girl, who was spending a year in\r\nMayfield with her parents. Her father, Dr. Larsen, was a visiting\r\nprofessor of chemistry, engaged to teach this season at the State\r\nAgricultural College in Mayfield. Ken's own father was head of the\r\nchemistry department there.\r\n\r\n\"Come down to the post office with me to get some stamps,\" Ken said.\r\n\"Then I'll drive you home.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's closed. You can't get any stamps tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe the boys in gray haven't been too busy watching the comet to\r\nstock the stamp machine. Look out!\" He pulled her back quickly as she\r\nstepped from the curb. A wheezy car moved past, its driver completely\r\nintent on his observation of the comet.\r\n\r\n\"Old Dad Martin's been trying to wrap that thing around a pole for 25\r\nyears,\" Ken said unhappily. \"It looks like he's going to make it\r\ntonight!\"\r\n\r\nAlong the street, bystanders whistled at the aged driver, and\r\npedestrians yelled at one another to get out of the way. The car's\r\nprogress broke, for a moment, the sense of ominous concern that spread\r\nover Main Street.\r\n\r\nAt the post office, Ken found Maria's prediction was right. The stamp\r\nmachine was empty.\r\n\r\n\"I have some at home,\" the girl said. \"You're welcome to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need a lot. Mother's sending out some invitations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I have enough. Papa says I'm supporting the postal department\r\nwith all the letters I write to everyone at home in Sweden.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll take you up on it. I'll get skinned if I don't get\r\nthem. I was supposed to pick them up this afternoon and I forgot all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I learned good English in the schools in Sweden,\" said Maria\r\nwistfully, \"but I don't seem to understand half what you say. This\r\n'skinned'--what does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing you need to worry about,\" Ken laughed. \"If you would teach me\r\nEnglish the way you learned it, Miss Rymer would give me a lot better\r\nmarks in her class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I think you're making fun of me,\" said Maria.\r\n\r\n\"Not me. Believe me, I'm not! Hey, look what's coming down the street!\r\nThat's old Granny Wicks. I thought she had died a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn front of the post office, an ancient white horse drew a light,\r\nramshackle wagon to a halt. From the seat, a small, wizened, old woman\r\nlooked at the crowd on the street. She dropped the reins in front of\r\nher. Her eyes, set deeply in her wrinkled face, were bright and sharp as\r\na bird's, and moved with the same snapping motions.\r\n\r\nFrom both sides of the street the bystanders watched her. Granny Wicks\r\nwas known to everyone in Mayfield. She was said to have been the first\r\nwhite child born in the valley, almost a hundred years ago. At one time,\r\nher horse and wagon were familiar, everyday sights on the streets, but\r\nshe seldom came to town any more.\r\n\r\nMany people, like Ken, had had the vague impression that she was dead.\r\n\r\nShe appeared lively enough now as she scrambled down from the wagon seat\r\nand moved across the sidewalk to the post office steps. She climbed\r\nthese and stood in front of the doors. Curiously, the crowd watched her.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, you!\" she exclaimed suddenly. Her voice was high and\r\nshrill, reminding Ken of an angry bird's. Maria looked at him\r\nwonderingly, and he shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me what she's up to. She's pulled some corkers in her time.\"\r\n\r\nGranny Wicks looked over the gathering crowd. Then she pointed a bony\r\narm at the glowing comet. \"You know what it means,\" she exclaimed\r\nshrilly. \"You feel it in your bones, and your hearts quiver with fear.\r\nThere's death in the sky, and an omen to all the inhabitants of the\r\nEarth that destruction awaits men.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped and glared. The laughter that had first greeted her gave\r\nway to uneasiness as people glanced at their neighbors, then hastily at\r\nthe comet, and back to Granny Wicks. Some began moving away in\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\"You're scared to listen, eh?\" Granny shrilled at them. \"You're afraid\r\nto know what's in store! Turn your backs then! Close your ears! You\r\ncan't change the signs in the heavens!\"\r\n\r\nA movement in the crowd caught Ken's eye. He saw the stout figure of\r\nSheriff Johnson moving toward the steps. The law officer stepped out in\r\nfront and approached Granny Wicks.\r\n\r\n\"Come on now, Granny,\" said Sheriff Johnson. \"You wouldn't want to scare\r\nfolks out of a good night's sleep, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You let me alone, Sam Johnson! I'm saying what I have to say, and\r\nnobody's going to stop me. Listen to me, all of you! There's death in\r\nMayfield in the winter that's coming, and spring won't see one man in\r\nten left alive. Remember what I say. The stars have sent their\r\nmessenger....\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Granny, let's go,\" said the Sheriff. \"You've said your piece and\r\nscared the daylights out of everybody. You'd better be getting on out to\r\nyour place before it gets dark. The comet won't light things up all\r\nnight. How's your supply of wood and coal for the winter, Granny? The\r\nboys been getting it in for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got plenty, Sam Johnson. More'n I'll need for this winter. Come\r\nspring, I won't be around to be needing anything else from anybody.\r\nNeither will you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff watched as the old woman climbed to her wagon seat again.\r\nThose standing nearby helped her gently. She took the reins and snapped\r\nthem at the weary horse.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, Granny!\" someone called.\r\n\r\nSheriff Johnson stood silently on the steps until the wagon passed out\r\nof sight around the corner of the block. Then he moved slowly by Ken and\r\nMaria. He smiled grimly at Ken.\r\n\r\n\"It's bad enough to have that thing hanging up there in the sky without\r\nthat kind of talk.\" He glanced up for a moment. \"It gives you the\r\nwillies. Sometimes I wonder, myself, if Granny isn't half-right.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stillness in the street as the people slowly dispersed ahead\r\nof the Sheriff. Voices were low, and the banter was gone. The yellow\r\nlight from the sky cast weird, bobbing shadows on the pavement and\r\nagainst the buildings.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go?\" Maria asked. \"This is giving me--what do you say?--the\r\ncreeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's crazy!\" Ken exclaimed with a burst of feeling. \"It shows what\r\nignorance of something new and strange can do. One feebleminded, old\r\nwoman can infect a whole crowd with her crazy superstitions, just\r\nbecause they don't know any more about this thing than she does!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's more than that,\" said Maria quietly. \"It's the feeling that people\r\nhave always had about the world they find themselves in. It doesn't\r\nmatter how much you know about the ocean and the winds and the tides,\r\nthere is always a feeling of wonder and fear when you stand on the shore\r\nand watch enormous waves pounding the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Even if you know what makes the thunder and the lightning, you can't\r\nwatch a great storm without feeling very small and puny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" Ken said. \"Astronomers feel all that when they look a\r\ncouple of billion light-years into space. Physicists know it when they\r\ndiscover a new particle of matter. But _they_ don't go around muttering\r\nabout omens and signs. You can feel the strength of natural forces\r\nwithout being scared to death.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe that's what marks the only real difference between witches and\r\nscientists, after all! The first scientist was the guy who saw fire come\r\ndown from the sky and decided that was the answer to some of his\r\nproblems. The witch doctor was too scared of both the problem and the\r\nanswer to believe the problem could ever have a solution. So he\r\nmanufactured delusions to make himself and others think the problem\r\nwould just quietly go away. There are a lot of witch doctors still\r\noperating and they're not all as easy to recognize as Granny Wicks!\"\r\n\r\nThey reached Ken's car, and he held the door open for Maria. As he\r\nclimbed in his own side he said, \"How about coming over to my place and\r\nhaving a look at the comet through my telescope? You'll see something\r\nreally awe-inspiring then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd love to. Right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\" Ken started the car and swung away from the curb, keeping a\r\ncareful eye on the road, watching for any others like Dad Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I think there will be a great many things I'll miss when we\r\ngo back to Sweden,\" Maria said thoughtfully, as she settled back in the\r\nseat, enjoying the smooth, powerful ride of Ken's souped-up car.\r\n\r\nKen shot a quick glance at her. He felt a sudden sense of loss, as if he\r\nhad not realized before that their acquaintance was strictly temporary.\r\n\"I guess a lot of people here will miss the Larsens, too,\" he said\r\nquietly. \"What will you miss most of all?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bigness of everything,\" said Maria. \"The hundreds and hundreds of\r\nmiles of open country. The schoolboys with cars to cover the distance.\r\nAt home, a grown man is fortunate to have one. Papa had a very hard time\r\nowning one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you persuade him to stay here? Mayfield's a darn good place\r\nto live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've tried already, but he says that when a man is grown he has too\r\nmany things to hold him to the place he's always known. He has promised,\r\nhowever, to let me come back if I want to, after I finish the university\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be nice.\" Ken turned away, keeping his eyes intently on the\r\nroad. There was nothing else he could say.\r\n\r\nHe drove slowly up the long grade of College Avenue. His family lived in\r\nan older house a block below the brow of College Hill. It gave a\r\npleasant view of the entire expanse of the valley in which Mayfield was\r\nsituated. The houses of the town ranged themselves in neat, orderly rows\r\nbelow, and spread out on the other side of the business section. In the\r\ndistance, north and south, were the small farms where hay and dairy\r\nstock and truck crops had been raised since pioneer times.\r\n\r\n\"I'll miss this, too,\" said Maria. \"It's beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nKen wasn't listening to her, however. The car had begun to sputter\r\npainfully as it took the curve leading off the avenue to Linwood Street\r\nwhere Ken lived. He glanced at the heat indicator. The needle was almost\r\nat the boiling point.\r\n\r\n\"For Pete's sake! The water must have leaked out of the radiator.\"\r\n\r\nKen pulled the car to the curb in front of the house and got out,\r\nleaving the engine idling. He raised the hood and cautiously turned the\r\nradiator cap with his handkerchief. A cloud of steam shot out, but when\r\nhe lifted the cap the water was not quite boiling, and there was plenty\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMaria came up beside him. \"Is something wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got me there. The radiator's clean. The pump isn't more than two\r\nmonths old. I checked the timing last Saturday. Something's gone sour to\r\nmake her heat up like that.\"\r\n\r\nFrom across the street, his neighbor, Mr. Wilkins, approached with a\r\ngrin. \"Looks like the same thing hit us both. Mine started boiling as I\r\ncame up the hill tonight. It's got me stumped.\"\r\n\r\n\"The circulation must be clogged,\" said Ken. \"Either that or the timing\r\nhas slipped off. That's all it could be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those were my ideas, too. Both wrong in my case. Let me know if you get\r\nany other bright ones.\" He moved off with a pleasant wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"It will cool,\" said Ken to Maria. \"By the time you're ready to leave\r\nI'll be able to drive you home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want you to damage your car. I can walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see.\"\r\n\r\nHe led her around the house. In the center of the backyard loomed the\r\nhigh, round dome of his amateur observatory. It was Ken's personal\r\npride, as well as that of the members of the Mayfield High Science Club,\r\nwho had helped build the shell and the mountings. The club used it every\r\nThursday night when the seeing was good.\r\n\r\nKen had ground the precision mirror alone. He had ground his first one,\r\na 4-inch glass, when he was a Boy Scout. Three years later he had\r\ntackled the tremendous job of producing a 12-inch one. Professor Douglas\r\nof the physics department at the college had pronounced it perfect.\r\n\r\nKen opened the door and switched on the light inside the dome. \"Don't\r\nmind the mess,\" he said. \"I've been taking photographs of the comet for\r\nthe last month.\"\r\n\r\nTo Maria, who was used to the clutter of a laboratory, there was no\r\nmess. She admired the beauty of the instrument Ken and his friends had\r\nbuilt. \"Our university telescope isn't any better,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You can't tell by the plumbing,\" Ken laughed. \"Better take a look at\r\nthe image before you pass judgment.\"\r\n\r\nSkilfully, he swung the long tube around to the direction of the comet.\r\nWith the fine controls he centered the cross hairs of the eyepiece on\r\nthe blazing object in the sky.\r\n\r\n\"It's moving too fast to stay in range very long,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMaria stepped to the observer's position. She gasped suddenly at the\r\nimage of the fiery monster hovering in the sky. Viewing the comet along\r\nthe axis of the tail, as the Earth lay at the edge of it, an observer's\r\nvision was like that of a miniature, flaming sun with an offcenter halo\r\nof pulsing, golden light.\r\n\r\nTo Maria, the comet seemed like something living. Slow, almost\r\nimperceptible ripples in the glowing scarves of light made them sway as\r\nif before some mighty, cosmic wind in space.\r\n\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" Maria murmured, \"but it's terrible, too. No wonder the\r\nancients believed comets brought evil and death upon the Earth. I could\r\nalmost believe it, myself!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2. _Breakdown_\r\n\r\n\r\nKen Maddox could not remember a time when he had not wanted to become a\r\nscientist. Maybe it started when his father first invited him to look\r\nthrough a microscope. That was when he was a very small boy, but he\r\ncould still remember the revelation of that experience. He remembered\r\nhow it had seemed, on looking away from the lens, that the whole world\r\nof normal vision was only a fragment of that which was hidden behind\r\ncurtains and shrouds and locked doors. Only men, like his father, with\r\nspecial instruments and wisdom and knowledge, could ever hope to\r\nunderstand the world of the unknown, which the ordinary person did not\r\neven suspect.\r\n\r\nNow, at sixteen, Ken was tall, with black hair that had an annoying curl\r\nto it. He was husky enough to be the main asset of the football squad of\r\nMayfield High School in his senior year. He knew exactly where he was\r\ngoing and what he was going to do. He would be one of those men who\r\nlived beyond the mere surface of the world, and who would seek to\r\nunderstand its deep and hidden meanings.\r\n\r\nKen thought of this as he watched Maria at the telescope. What a\r\ndifference between knowing the comet as this instrument showed it, and\r\nwith the knowledge revealed by modern astronomy, and knowing it as the\r\naverage person in Mayfield did.\r\n\r\nKen and Maria stayed in the observatory until the comet had almost\r\ndisappeared below the horizon. Mrs. Maddox brought a snack of sandwiches\r\nand punch.\r\n\r\n\"I always do this when I see the observatory dome open,\" she said,\r\nsmiling. \"I never know when Ken's going to quit his stargazing and come\r\nin for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're about through, Mom. I'll drive Maria over to her place and be\r\nback in a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to loan him the stamps,\" Maria said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maddox looked at Ken in mock severity. \"You mean you forgot\r\n_again_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I remembered,\" Ken said lamely. \"After the post office closed, that\r\nis. Anyhow, Maria has plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Maddox, \"I know who's going to have to mail my\r\ninvitations if they're ever to get out in time for the party!\"\r\n\r\nAfter he and Maria had finished the snack, Ken started his car again.\r\nThe engine had cooled to normal temperature, but he watched the\r\nindicator closely as he drove. Nothing seemed right about the action of\r\nthe car. The engine had turned over sluggishly when he pressed the\r\nstarter button, as if the battery were almost dead. Now it lugged\r\nheavily, even when going downhill.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing's haywire,\" Ken said irritably. \"It acts like the\r\ncrankcase is full of sand or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me walk the rest of the way,\" said Maria. \"You take the car back,\r\nand I'll bring the stamps over on my way to school in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we're almost there. Nothing much more could go wrong than already\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Maria's place they found Professor and Mrs. Larsen\r\nsitting on the porch.\r\n\r\n\"We've been watching the comet,\" Maria said excitedly. \"Ken let me look\r\nat it through his telescope.\"\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable event,\" said Professor Larsen. \"I feel very fortunate to\r\nbe alive to witness it. My generation hasn't had this kind of privilege\r\nbefore. I was a child when Halley's comet appeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been trying to tell Maria what a lucky break this is, but she\r\nagrees with Granny Wicks,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not!\" Maria snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Granny Wicks?\" Professor Larsen inquired. \"Your grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Ken tried to cover the professor's lack of familiarity with\r\nAmerican idioms. \"She's just the town's oldest citizen. Everybody likes\r\nher and calls her Granny, but her mind belongs to the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear that, Papa?\" cried Maria. \"Her mind belongs to the Middle\r\nAges, and he says I'm like Granny Wicks!\"\r\n\r\nMaria's mother laughed gently. \"I'm sure Ken didn't mean your mind is of\r\nthe Middle Ages, too, dear.\"\r\n\r\nKen flushed. \"Of course not. What I mean is that Granny Wicks thinks the\r\ncomet is something mysterious and full of omens, and Maria says she sort\r\nof thinks the same about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything about omens and signs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, except for that....\"\r\n\r\n\"Except for that, I suppose we are all in agreement,\" said Professor\r\nLarsen slowly. He drew on his pipe and it glowed brightly in the\r\ndarkness. \"The whole universe is a terrible place that barely tolerates\r\nliving organisms. Almost without exception it is filled with great suns\r\nthat are flaming, atomic furnaces, or dead cinders of planets to which a\r\nscrap of poisonous atmosphere may cling. Yes, it is indeed a great\r\nmiracle that here in this corner of the universe conditions exist where\r\nliving things have found a foothold. We may be glad that this is so, but\r\nit does not pay man to ever forget the fierceness of the home in which\r\nhe lives. Earth is merely one room of that home, on the pleasant, sunny\r\nside of the house. But the whole universe is his home.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the thing I've been trying to say,\" Ken answered. \"We can know\r\nthis without being afraid.\"\r\n\r\nMaria's father nodded. \"Yes. Fear is of no use to anyone. Awe, respect,\r\nadmiration, wonder, humility--these are all necessary. But not fear.\"\r\n\r\nMaria turned from the group. \"I'll bring the stamps, Ken,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come in and have some cake?\" Mrs. Larsen asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks. Mother fed us before we left my place. I'm afraid I\r\ncouldn't eat any more.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Maria was back. \"Here are two whole sheets,\" she said. \"I\r\nhope that will be enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty. I'll see you get repaid tomorrow. Good night, everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Ken.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved down the walk toward his car and got in. When he pressed die\r\nstarter button the engine groaned for a few seconds and came to a\r\ncomplete stop. He tried again; there was only a momentary, protesting\r\ngrind.\r\n\r\nKen got out and raised the hood and leaned over the engine in disgusted\r\ncontemplation. There was no visible clue to the cause of the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Is your battery dead?\" Professor Larsen called.\r\n\r\n\"No. It's something else.\" Ken slammed the hood harder than he had\r\nintended. \"I'll have to leave it here overnight and pick it up in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can push you home with my car, or at least give you a ride.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, please don't bother,\" Ken said. \"I'll tow it home with Dad's car\r\ntomorrow. I'd just as soon walk, now. It's only a few blocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you wish. Good night, Ken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Professor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKen's clock radio woke him the next morning. He reached over to shut off\r\nthe newscast it carried. There was only one item any commentator talked\r\nabout now, the comet. Ken wondered how they could get away with a\r\nrepetition of the same thing, over and over, but they seemed able to get\r\nan audience as long as they kept the proper tone of semi-hysteria in\r\ntheir voices.\r\n\r\nAs his hand touched the dial to switch it off, something new caught\r\nKen's attention. \"A curious story is coming in from all parts of the\r\ncountry this morning,\" the announcer said. \"Auto mechanics are reporting\r\na sudden, unusually brisk business. No one knows the reason, but there\r\nseems to be a virtual epidemic of car breakdowns. Some garagemen are\r\nsaid to be blaming new additives in gasoline and lubricating oil. It is\r\nreported that one major oil company is undertaking an investigation of\r\nthese charges, but, in the meantime, no one really seems to have a good\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"In connection with the comet, however, from widely scattered areas\r\ncomes the report that people are even blaming these engine failures on\r\nour poor, old comet. In the Middle Ages they blamed comets for\r\neverything from soured cream to fallen kingdoms. Maybe this modern age\r\nisn't so different, after all. At any rate, this comet will no doubt be\r\nhappy to get back into open space, where there are no Earthmen to blame\r\nit for all their accidents and shortcomings!\"\r\n\r\nKen switched off the radio and lay back on the pillow. That was a real\r\nchoice one--blaming the comet for car breakdowns! Page Granny Wicks!\r\n\r\nThe breakdowns were curious, however. There was no good reason why there\r\nshould be a sudden rash of them. He wondered if they had actually\r\noccurred, or if the story was just the work of some reporter trying to\r\nmake something out of his own inability to get into a couple of garages\r\nthat were swamped by the usual weekend rush. This was most likely the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nHowever it didn't explain why his own car had suddenly conked out, Ken\r\nthought irritably. He'd have to get it over to Art Matthews' garage as\r\nsoon as school was out.\r\n\r\nAt school that morning there was little talk of anything but the comet.\r\nAfter physics class, Ken was met by Joe Walton and three other members\r\nof the science club, of which Ken was president.\r\n\r\n\"We want a special meeting,\" said Joe. \"We've just had the most\r\nbrilliant brainstorm of our brief careers.\"\r\n\r\n\"It had better be more brilliant than the last one,\" said Ken. \"That\r\ndrained the club treasury of its last peso.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was watching the comet last night, and I began to smell the dust of\r\nits tail as the Earth moved into it....\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have been smelling something a lot more powerful than comet\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said to myself--why don't we collect some of that stuff and bottle it\r\nand see what it's made of? What do you think?\" Joe asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nKen scowled. \"Just how many molecules of material from the comet's tail\r\ndo you think there are in the atmosphere over Mayfield right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know? Six--maybe eight.\"\r\n\r\nKen laughed. \"You're crazy, anyway. What have you got in mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Joe answered seriously. \"We know the comet's tail is so\r\nrarefied that it resembles a pretty fair vacuum, but it _is_ composed of\r\nsomething. As it mixes with the atmosphere we ought to be able to\r\ndetermine the changing makeup of the air and get a pretty good idea of\r\nthe composition of the comet's tail. This is a chance nobody's ever had\r\nbefore--and maybe never will again, until we go right out there in\r\nspaceships--being right inside a comet's tail long enough to analyze\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like a terrific project,\" Ken admitted. \"The universities\r\nwill all be doing it, of course, but it would still be a neat trick if\r\nwe could bring it off. Maybe Dad and Professor Larsen will have ideas on\r\nhow we could do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be able to make most of the equipment,\" said Joe, \"so it\r\nshouldn't be too expensive. Anyway, we'll have a meeting then, right\r\nafter school?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--no, wait. The engine in my car conked out. I've got to go over to\r\nArt's with it this afternoon. You go ahead without me. Kick the idea\r\naround and let me know what's decided. I'll go along with anything short\r\nof mortgaging the football field.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" said Joe. \"I don't see why you don't just sell that hunk of junk\r\nand get a real automobile. You've got a good excuse now. This breakdown\r\nis a good omen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk to me about omens!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArt Matthews had the best equipped garage in town, and was a sort of\r\nunofficial godfather to all the hot-rodders in the county. He helped\r\nthem plane the heads of their cars. He got their special cams and\r\ncarburetor and manifold assemblies wholesale, and he gave them fatherly\r\nadvice about using their heads when they were behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nKen called him at noon. \"I've got troubles, Art,\" he said. \"Can I bring\r\nthe car over after school?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do a thing for you today,\" Art Matthews said. \"I\r\ndon't know what's happened, but I've had tow calls all day. Right now\r\nthe shop is full and they're stacked four-high outside. I'm going to do\r\na couple of highway patrol cars and Doc Adams'. I figured they ought to\r\nhave priority.\"\r\n\r\nKen felt a sudden, uneasy sense of recognition. This was the same kind\r\nof thing he had heard about on the radio that morning! A rash of car\r\nbreakdowns all over the country. Now, the same thing in Mayfield!\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with them?\" he asked the mechanic. \"Why is everybody\r\ncoming in with trouble at the same time?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're not coming in,\" said Art. \"I'm having to go out after them. I\r\ndon't know yet what's wrong. They heat up and stall. It's the craziest\r\nthing I've run into in 30 years of garage work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine acted the same way,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah? Well, you're in good company. Listen, why don't you and maybe Joe\r\nand Al come down and give me a hand after school? I'll never get on top\r\nhere without some help. After we get these police and other priority\r\ncars out of the way, maybe we can get a quick look at what's wrong with\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a deal.\"\r\n\r\nJoe Walton wasn't much in favor of spending that afternoon and an\r\nunknown number of others in Art's garage; he was too overwhelmed by the\r\nidea of analyzing the material of the comet's tail. However Art had done\r\nall of them too many favors in the past to ignore his call for help.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble with this town,\" Joe said, \"is that three-fourths of the\r\nso-called automobiles running around the streets belong down at\r\nThompson's Auto Wrecking.\"\r\n\r\nAl Miner agreed to come, too. When they reached the garage after school\r\nthey saw Art had not been exaggerating. His place was surrounded by\r\nstalled cars, and the street outside was lined with them in both\r\ndirections. Ken borrowed the tow truck and brought his own car back from\r\nthe Larsens'. By that time the other two boys were at work.\r\n\r\n\"Batteries are all okay,\" Art told him. \"Some of these engines will turn\r\nover, but most of them won't budge. I've jerked a couple of heads, but\r\nI can't see anything. I want you to take the pans off and take down the\r\nbearings to see if they're frozen. That's what they act like. When\r\nthat's done, we'll take it from there.\"\r\n\r\nKen hoisted the front end of one of the police cars and slid under it on\r\na creeper. Art's electric impact wrenches were all in use, so he began\r\nthe laborious removal of the pan bolts by hand. He had scarcely started\r\nwhen he heard a yell from Joe who was beneath the other police car.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Art called.\r\n\r\n\"Come here! Look at this!\"\r\n\r\nThe others crowded around, peering under the car. Joe banged and pried\r\nat one of the bearings, still clinging to the crankshaft after the cap\r\nhad been removed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that!\" Art shouted at him. \"You'll jimmy up the crankshaft!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Matthews,\" Joe said solemnly, \"this here crankshaft has been\r\njimmied up just as much as it's ever going to get jimmied. These\r\nbearings are welded solid. They'll have to be machined off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could freeze them to the shaft that hard,\" Art exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJoe moved out of the way. Art crawled under and tapped the bearing. He\r\npried at it with a chisel. Then he applied a cold chisel and pounded.\r\nThe bearing metal came away chip by chip, but the bulk of it clung to\r\nthe shaft as if welded.\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen anything like that before in my life!\" Art came out\r\nfrom beneath the car.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think could cause it?\" Joe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Gas!\" said Art vehemently. \"The awful gas they're putting out these\r\ndays. They put everything into it except sulphur and molasses, and they\r\nexpect an engine to run. Additives, they call 'em! Detergents! Why can't\r\nthey sell us plain old gasoline?\"\r\n\r\nKen watched from a distance behind the group. He looked at the silent,\r\nmotionless cars in uneasy speculation. He recalled again the radio\r\nannouncement of that morning. Maybe it _could_ be something they were\r\nadding to the gas or oil, as Art said. It couldn't, however, happen so\r\nsuddenly--not all over the country. Not in New York, Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, San Francisco, and Mayfield. Not all at the same time.\r\n\r\nArt turned up the shop lights. Outside, as the sun lowered in the sky,\r\nthe glow of the comet began turning the landscape a copper-yellow hue.\r\nIts light came through the broad doors of the garage and spread over the\r\nhalf-dismantled cars.\r\n\r\n\"All right, let's go,\" said Art. His voice held a kind of false\r\ncheeriness, as if something far beyond his comprehension had passed\r\nbefore him and he was at a loss to meet it or even understand it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" he said again. \"Loosen all those connecting rods and get the\r\nshafts out. We'll see what happens when we try to pull the pistons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3. _Power Failure_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news broadcasts the following morning were less hysterical than\r\npreviously. Because the news itself was far more serious, the announcers\r\nfound it unnecessary to inject artificial notes of urgency.\r\n\r\nKen listened to his bedside radio as he watched the first tint of dawn\r\nabove the hills east of the valley. \"The flurry of mechanical failures,\r\nwhich was reported yesterday, has reached alarming proportions,\" the\r\nannouncer said. \"During the past 24 hours garages in every section of\r\nthe nation have been flooded with calls. From the other side of the\r\nAtlantic reports indicate the existence of a similar situation in Europe\r\nand in the British Isles.\r\n\r\n\"Automobile breakdowns are not the most serious accidents that are\r\ntaking place. Other forms of machinery are also being affected. A crack\r\ntrain of the Southern Pacific came to a halt last night in the Arizona\r\ndesert. All efforts of the crew to repair the stalled engine were\r\nfruitless. A new one had to be brought up in order for the passengers to\r\ncontinue on their way early this morning.\r\n\r\n\"From Las Vegas comes word that one of the huge generators at Hoover Dam\r\nhas been taken out of service because of mechanical failure. Three other\r\nlarge municipalities have had similar service interruptions. These are\r\nRochester, New York, Clinton, Missouri, and Bakersfield, California.\r\n\r\n\"Attempts have been made to find some authoritative comment on the\r\nsituation from scientists and Government officials. So far, no one has\r\nbeen willing to commit himself to an opinion as to the cause of this\r\nunexplained and dangerously growing phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday it was jokingly whispered that the comet was responsible.\r\nToday, although no authority can be found to verify it, the rumor\r\npersists that leading scientists are seriously considering the\r\npossibility that the comet may actually have something to do with the\r\nbreakdowns.\"\r\n\r\nKen turned off the radio and lay back with his hands beneath his head,\r\nstaring at the ceiling. His first impulse was to ridicule again this\r\nfantastic idea about the comet. Yet, there had to be _some_ explanation.\r\n\r\nHe had seen enough of the engines in Art's garage last night to know\r\nthey had suffered no ordinary mechanical disorder. Something had\r\nhappened to them that had never happened to engines before, as far as he\r\nknew. The crankshafts were immovable in their bearings. The pistons had\r\nbeen frozen tight in the cylinders when they tried to remove some of\r\nthem. Every moving part was welded to its mating piece as solidly as if\r\nthe whole engine had been heated to the very edge of melting and then\r\nallowed to cool.\r\n\r\nApparently something similar was happening to engines in every part of\r\nthe world. It could only mean that some common factor was at work in\r\nLondon, and Paris, and Cairo, and Mayfield. The only such factor newly\r\ninvading the environment of every city on the globe was the comet.\r\n\r\nIt would almost require a belief in witchcraft to admit the comet might\r\nbe responsible!\r\n\r\nKen arose and dressed slowly. By the time he was finished he heard his\r\nfather's call to breakfast from downstairs.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox was already seated when Ken entered the dining room. He\r\nwas a tall, spare man with an appearance of intense absorption in\r\neverything about him.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and nodded a pleasant good morning as Ken approached. \"I\r\nhear you worked overtime as an auto mechanic last night,\" he said.\r\n\"Isn't that a bit rough, along with the load you're carrying at school?\"\r\n\r\n\"Art asked us to do him a favor. Haven't you seen what's been happening\r\naround town?\"\r\n\r\n\"I noticed an unusual number of cars around the garage, and I wondered\r\nabout it. Has everyone decided to take care of their winter repairs at\r\nthe same time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you heard the radio, either, Dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I've been working on my new paper for the _Chemical Journal_ until\r\nmidnight for the last week. What has the radio got to do with your work\r\nas a mechanic?\"\r\n\r\nQuickly, Ken outlined to his father the events he had heard reported the\r\npast two days. \"It's not only automobiles, but trains, power plants,\r\nships, everything--\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox looked as if he could scarcely believe Ken was not\r\njoking. \"That would certainly be a strange set of coincidences,\" he said\r\nfinally, \"provided the reports are true, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true, all right,\" said Ken. \"It's not a matter of coincidence.\r\nSomething is causing it to happen!\"\r\n\r\n\"What could that possibly be?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's talk about the comet having something to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox almost choked on his spoonful of cereal. \"Ken,\" he\r\nlaughed finally, \"I thought you were such a stickler for rigid,\r\nscientific methods and hypotheses! What's happened to all your rigor?\"\r\n\r\nKen looked down at the tablecloth. \"I know it sounds ridiculous, like\r\nsomething out of the dim past, when they blamed comets for corns, and\r\nbroken legs, and lost battles. Maybe this time it isn't so crazy when\r\nyou stop to think about it, and it's absolutely the only new factor\r\nwhich could have some worldwide effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could it have any effect at all--worldwide or otherwise?\" Professor\r\nMaddox demanded.\r\n\r\n\"The whole world is immersed in its tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that tail is so tenuous that our senses do not even detect the\r\nfact!\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't mean it couldn't have some kind of effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as stopping engines? Well, you're a pretty good mechanic. Just\r\nwhat did the comet do to all these stalled pieces of machinery?\"\r\n\r\nKen felt his father was being unfair, yet he could scarcely blame him\r\nfor not taking the hypothesis seriously. \"I don't know what the comet\r\ndid--or could do--\" he said in a low voice. \"I just know I've never seen\r\nany engines like those we took apart last night.\"\r\n\r\nIn detail, he described to his father the appearance of the engine parts\r\nthey had dismantled. \"I brought home some samples of metal we cut from\r\nthe engine blocks with a torch. Would you take them up to the laboratory\r\nat the college and have them examined under the electron microscope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have time to run any such tests for several days. If you are\r\nintent on pursuing this thing, however, I'll tell you what I'll do. You\r\nand your science club friends can come up and use the equipment\r\nyourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know how!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll arrange for one of the teaching fellows to show you how to prepare\r\nmetallic samples and operate the electron microscope.\"\r\n\r\nKen's eyes lighted. \"Gee, that would be great if you would do that, Dad!\r\nWill you, really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come around after school today. I'll see that someone is there to help\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nArt Matthews was disappointed when Ken called and said none of the\r\nscience club members would be around that afternoon. He couldn't keep\r\nfrom showing in his voice that he felt they were letting him down.\r\n\r\n\"It's not any use trying to get those engines running,\" Ken said. \"The\r\npistons would never come out of most of them without being drilled out.\r\nWe're not equipped for that. Even if we got things loosened up and\r\nrunning again, what would keep the same thing from happening again?\r\nThat's what we've got to find out.\"\r\n\r\nArt was unable to accept this point of view. He held a bewildered but\r\ninsistent belief that something ought to be done about the mounting pile\r\nof disabled cars outside his garage. \"We can get some of them going,\r\nKen. You fellows have got to lend a hand. I can't tackle it without\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Ken said. \"We're convinced there's got to be another way to\r\nget at the problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. You guys do whatever you figure you've got to do. I can\r\nprobably round up some other help.\"\r\n\r\nKen hung up, wishing he had been able to make Art understand, but the\r\nmechanic would probably be the last person in Mayfield to accept that\r\nthe comet could have any possible connection with the frozen engines.\r\n\r\nAs Ken walked to school that morning he estimated that at least 25\r\npercent of the cars in Mayfield must be out of commission. Some of the\r\nmen in his neighborhood were in their driveways futilely punching their\r\nstarters while their engines moaned protestingly or refused to turn over\r\nat all. Others were peering under the hoods, shaking their heads, and\r\ncalling across the yards to their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn the street, some cars were lugging with great difficulty, but others\r\nmoved swiftly along without any evidence of trouble. Ken wondered how\r\nthere could be such a difference, and if some might prove immune, so to\r\nspeak, to the effect.\r\n\r\nHe had called a meeting of the club in the chemistry laboratory for an\r\nhour before the first class. All of the members were there when he\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nKen called the meeting to order at once. \"I guess you've all heard the\r\nnews broadcasts, and you know what's happening here in town,\" he said.\r\n\"Yesterday you talked about the possibility of collecting samples and\r\nanalyzing the material of the comet's tail. I don't know what you\r\ndecided. You can fill me in later on that. The problem is a lot more\r\nimportant now than it was yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"It's beginning to seem as if the presence of the comet may actually be\r\nresponsible for the wave of mechanical failures. Finding out how and why\r\nis just about the biggest problem in the whole world right now.\"\r\n\r\nA babble of exclamations and protests arose immediately from the other\r\nmembers of the group. Al Miner and Dave Whitaker were on their feet. Ted\r\nWatkins waved a hand and shouted, \"Don't tell us you're swallowing that\r\nsuperstitious junk!\"\r\n\r\nKen held up a hand. \"One at a time. We haven't got all day, and there's\r\na lot of ground to cover. Ted, what's your comment?\"\r\n\r\n\"My comment is that anybody's got a screw loose if he believes the\r\ncomet's got anything to do with all those cars being in Art's garage.\r\nThat stuff went out of fashion after the days of old Salem.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the others nodded vigorously as Ted spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we do need to bring some of you up to date on the background\r\nmaterial,\" said Ken. \"Joe, tell them what we found last night.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly, Joe Walton described the engines they had dismantled.\r\n\"Something had happened to them,\" he said, \"which had never happened to\r\nan engine since Ford drove his first horseless carriage down Main\r\nStreet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't mean anything!\" exclaimed Ted. \"No matter what it is, we\r\nhaven't any basis for tying it to the comet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you name any other universal factor that could account for it?\" Ken\r\nasked. \"We have an effect that appears suddenly in Mayfield, Chicago,\r\nParis, and Cairo. Some people say it's the additives in gasoline, but\r\nyou don't get them showing up simultaneously in all parts of the world.\r\nThere is no other factor common to every locality where the mechanical\r\nfailures have occurred, except the comet.\r\n\r\n\"So I called this meeting to suggest that we expand our project beyond\r\nanything we previously had in mind. I suggest we try to determine the\r\nexact relationship between the breakdowns and the appearance of the\r\ncomet.\"\r\n\r\nBig Dave Whitaker, sitting at the edge of the room, rose slowly in his\r\nseat. \"You've got the cart before the horse,\" he said. \"You've got a\r\nnice theory all set up and you want us to beat our brains out trying to\r\nprove it. Now, take me. I've got a theory that little green men from\r\nMars have landed and are being sucked into the air intake of the\r\nengines. Prove my theory first, why don't you?\"\r\n\r\nKen grinned good-naturedly. \"I stand corrected, but I won't back down\r\nvery far. I won't suggest we try to prove the connection with the comet,\r\nbut I do propose to set up some experiments to discover if there is any\r\nrelationship. If there is, then what it is. Does that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go along with that. How do you propose to go about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's find out where the rest stand,\" said Ken. \"How about it, you\r\nguys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go for it,\" said Ted, \"as long as we aren't out to prove a\r\nmedieval superstition.\"\r\n\r\nOne by one, the others nodded agreement. Joe Walton said intensely,\r\n\"We'll find out whether it's superstition or not! There's no other\r\npossible cause, and we'll prove it before we're through.\"\r\n\r\nKen smiled and waved him down. \"We're working on a hypothesis only.\r\nAnyway, here's what I have to suggest by way of procedure: Since the\r\ntail of the comet is so rarefied, there aren't many molecules of it in\r\nthe atmosphere of this entire valley. I don't know just what the\r\nmathematical chances of getting a measurable sample are. Maybe you can\r\nwork out some figures on it, Dave. We'll have to handle an enormous\r\nvolume of air, so let's get a blower as large as we can get our hands on\r\nand funnel the air through some electrically charged filters. We can\r\nwash down these filters with a solvent of some kind periodically and\r\ndistill whatever has collected on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't get enough to fill the left eye of a virus suffering from\r\narrested development,\" said Ted.\r\n\r\n\"We'll find out when we get set up,\" said Ken. \"My father has agreed to\r\ngive us access to the electron microscope at the college. Maybe we can\r\nuse their new mass spectrograph to help analyze whatever we collect.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we knew how to use a mass spectrograph,\" said Ted.\r\n\r\n\"He's offered to let one of the teaching fellows help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will all this prove, even if we do find something?\" Dave asked.\r\n\"You'll get all kinds of lines from a spectrogram of atmospheric dust.\r\nSo what?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we should get some lines that we can't identify, and if we should\r\nget those same lines from metallic specimens taken from the disabled\r\nengines, we would have evidence of the presence of a new factor. Then we\r\ncould proceed with a determination of what effect, if any, this factor\r\nhas on the engines.\"\r\n\r\nKen looked around the group once more. \"Any comments, suggestions,\r\narguments? There being none, we'll consider the project approved, and\r\nget to work this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAs they left to go to their first classes, Ted shook his head gloomily.\r\n\"Man, you don't know what you're biting off! All we've done so far is\r\nbuild a few ham radios, a telescope, and some Geiger counters. You're\r\ntalking about precision work now, and I mean _pree_-cision!\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the day Ken, too, felt increasing doubts about their ability\r\nto carry off the project. It would be a task of tremendous delicacy to\r\nanalyze such microscopic samples as they might succeed in obtaining.\r\nMicrochemical methods would be necessary, and none of them had had any\r\nexperience in that field. His father was an expert with these methods\r\nand though he might scold them for tackling such a difficult project,\r\nhe'd help them, Ken thought. He always had.\r\n\r\nThis was no ordinary project, however. Ken had no idea how seriously\r\nscientists in general were considering the comet as the offender, but\r\ncertainly they must be working frantically on the problem of the\r\nmechanical disorder. Unless they found another cause very soon, they\r\nwere certain to turn to an analysis of the comet's tail. It would be\r\nvery satisfying if Ken's group could actually be in the vanguard of such\r\na development.\r\n\r\nHe tried to ridicule his own conviction that the comet held the key. He\r\nhad no reason whatever for such a belief, except the fact of the comet's\r\nuniversal presence. How it could stop an automobile engine or a railroad\r\ntrain was beyond his wildest imaginings.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing else. Nothing at all.\r\n\r\nOn the way home after school, there seemed to Ken to be a subtle change\r\nthat had come over the valley since morning. Along the streets, cars\r\nwere parked in front of houses to which they did not belong. Little\r\nknots of people were standing about, talking in hushed tones. The comet\r\nwas aflame in the sky.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be not merely an awe and an uneasiness in the people,\r\nbut a genuine fear that Ken could not help absorbing as he moved past\r\nthem on the sidewalks. Their faces were yellow and flat under the glare\r\nof the comet, and they looked at him and at each other as if they were\r\nstrangers in an alien land.\r\n\r\nAlmost without being aware of it, Ken found himself running the last\r\nhalf-block before he reached his own home. He burst in the door and\r\ncalled out with forced cheeriness, \"Hi, Mom, what's cooking? I'm\r\nstarved. The whole gang's coming over in a few minutes. I hope you've\r\ngot something for them.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother came out of the kitchen, her face gray with uncertainty.\r\n\"You'll have to do with sandwiches this afternoon,\" she said. \"I haven't\r\nbeen able to use the electric stove since noon.\"\r\n\r\nKen stared at her.\r\n\r\n\"There's something about the power,\" she went on. \"We haven't any\r\nlights, either. They say the power station at Collin's Dam went out of\r\ncommission this morning. They don't know when they'll be able to get it\r\nback on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4. _Disaster Spreads_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he stood, shocked by his mother's statement, Ken heard the phone\r\nringing in the next room. On battery power at the telephone central\r\noffice, he thought.\r\n\r\nHis mother answered, and there was a pause. \"Professor Maddox is at the\r\ncollege,\" she said. \"You can probably reach him there, or I can give him\r\nyour message when he comes home.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned to the doorway. \"That was the power company. They want your\r\nfather and Dr. Douglas to have a look at their generators.\r\n\r\n\"Ken, what do you think this means?\" she asked worriedly. \"What will\r\nhappen if all our power goes off and doesn't come back on? Do you think\r\nyour father has any idea what's causing the trouble?\"\r\n\r\nKen shook his head. \"I don't know, Mom. So far, nobody seems to know\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than 15 minutes, Professor Maddox hurried into the house.\r\n\"Couldn't get my car going,\" he said. \"It's stalled on the campus\r\nparking lot. The power company wants me to go to Collin's Dam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Mrs. Maddox. \"They called here.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, staring out the window, a look of bewilderment on\r\nhis face. \"This thing seems to be more serious than I would have\r\nbelieved possible. There's just no explanation for it, none at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Any chance of my going along, Dad?\" Ken said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not. We're going in Dr. Larsen's car, and it's half loaded\r\nwith instruments. I hope we make it there and back without breaking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"I'll probably be back early this evening, but don't hold dinner on my\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be only sandwiches,\" said Ken's mother. \"I can't cook\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Just leave me some of whatever you have.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the doorway Ken watched his father and the other two scientists. He\r\nthought he detected a loginess in the engine as Professor Larsen drove\r\naway from the curb.\r\n\r\nWhat they hoped to accomplish, Ken didn't know, but he felt certain they\r\nwould find the same thing in the generators that had been found in the\r\nautomobile engines. The bearings were probably frozen so tight that they\r\nand the shaft had become one solid piece of metal. He hoped the\r\nscientists would bring back some samples of the metal.\r\n\r\nBy 4 o'clock all the members of the science club had arrived. They met\r\nin what Ken called his \"science shack,\" a small building next to the\r\nobservatory. Here he kept the amateur radio equipment belonging to the\r\nclub, and his own personal collections in the several different fields\r\nin which he had been interested since his Boy Scout days.\r\n\r\nIn each of his companions, Ken could see the effect of the feeling that\r\nnow pervaded the town. Their usual horseplay was almost forgotten, and\r\ntheir faces were sober to the point of fear.\r\n\r\n\"We aren't going to be able to run our blower by electricity,\" said Joe\r\nWalton. \"We can't even get power for the precipitating filters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's scrounge anything we can find that runs on gasoline or coal oil,\"\r\nsaid Al Miner. \"If we act fast we ought to be able to pick up some old\r\nmotorcycle engines or some power lawn mowers from the dump. Thompson's\r\nhave probably got some. We can try people's basements, too. Let's get as\r\nmany as possible, because we don't know how long any one will last, and\r\nwe may have to run the blower for weeks, in order to get any kind of\r\nsample.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Ken. \"Here's something else: Who's got a car left to\r\ngather this stuff in?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Ours was still running this morning,\" Frank Abrams said, \"but I won't\r\nguarantee how long we can count on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty soon there won't be any we can count on. We've got to get a\r\nhorse and wagon before they start selling for as much as a new Cadillac\r\nused to.\"\r\n\r\n\"My uncle's got one on his farm,\" said Dave Whitaker. \"He would probably\r\nloan it to me, but he's five miles out of town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take my bike,\" said Ken. \"See if he'll let you borrow it and a wagon\r\nfor at least a couple of weeks or longer. Bring some bales of hay, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dave had gone, Al said, \"What about the blower? Anybody know where\r\nwe can get one of those?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there's one at Thompson's,\" said Ted. \"They pulled it out of\r\nPete and Mary's restaurant when they remodeled.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be just a little kitchen blower. Not big enough--we need a\r\nman-sized one.\"\r\n\r\nKen said, after a long pause, \"There isn't one in town. The chances of\r\ngetting one from somewhere else are practically zero. Frederick is 50\r\nmiles away and by tomorrow there may not be a car in town that would go\r\nthat far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Al, \"how about the air-conditioning systems in town? There\r\nisn't one that's any good where it is, now. Both the high school and the\r\ncollege have big ones. I'll bet we could get permission at either place\r\nto revamp the intake and outlet ducts so we could put in our filters and\r\nprecipitators. Your father and his friends could swing it for us at the\r\ncollege.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might be right! It's worth trying. For precipitators we can rig a\r\nbattery-powered system that will put a few thousand volts on the\r\nscreens. Art will let us have enough car batteries for that. I think\r\nwe're set!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDave Whitaker did not return until dusk, but he had succeeded in getting\r\nthe horse and wagon, and a load of hay. He deposited this in his own\r\nyard before driving back to Ken's place.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two or three hours the boys found two old motorcycle\r\nengines, a power lawn-mower motor, and one old gasoline-powered washing\r\nmachine. All of these they took down to Art Matthews' place and begged\r\nhim for space and tools to overhaul the equipment.\r\n\r\n\"You can have the whole joint,\" Art said dejectedly. \"This pile of junk\r\nwill never move!\" He waved a hand at the cars lined up and down both\r\nsides of the streets near his place.\r\n\r\nBy 9 o'clock they had succeeded in getting all of the small engines\r\nrunning, but they dared not test them too long, hoping to conserve all\r\npossible life that might be left. When they were through, they returned\r\nto Ken's house. Mrs. Maddox had sandwiches ready for them.\r\n\r\nNo word had been heard from the three scientists who had gone to the\r\npower plant. Maria called, anxious about her father.\r\n\r\n\"I'm worried, Ken,\" she said. \"What would happen to them out there if\r\nthe car breaks down and they have no place to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll be all right,\" Ken reassured her. \"They probably found\r\nsomething bigger than they expected at the dam. If they should have\r\ntrouble with the car they can find a phone along the road at some\r\nfarmhouse and let us know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help worrying,\" said Maria. \"Everything feels so strange\r\ntonight, just the way it does before a big thunderstorm, as if something\r\nterrible were going to happen!\"\r\n\r\nKen sensed the way she felt. It was all he could do to hold back the\r\nsame reaction within himself, but he knew it must be far more difficult\r\nfor Maria, being in a foreign country among strangers with customs she\r\ndidn't understand.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you and your mother come over here until they get back?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they don't come back at all? Tonight, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can sleep here. Mom's got plenty of room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask Mamma. If it's all right with her, we'll be right over.\"\r\n\r\nKen hoped they would come. He found himself concerned beyond all reason\r\nthat Maria and her mother should be made comfortable and relieved of\r\ntheir worries.\r\n\r\nHe went out to the backyard again, where all the other members of the\r\nclub were still lounging on the grass, watching the sky. The comet was\r\ntwenty degrees above the horizon, although the sun had long since set\r\nbelow the western mountains. No one seemed to feel this was a night for\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Let's try your battery portable for a few minutes,\" said Joe Walton.\r\n\"I'd like to know what's going on in the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nKen brought it out and turned it on. The local station was off the air,\r\nof course, and so was the one in Frederick. Half the power there came\r\nfrom the Collin's Dam. More than one-third of the usual stations were\r\nmissing, but Ken finally picked up one coming in clearly from the\r\nnorthern tip of the state.\r\n\r\nThe announcer didn't sound like an announcer. He sounded like an\r\nordinary man in the midst of a great and personal tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Over three-fourths of the cars in the United States,\" he was saying,\r\n\"are now estimated to be out of commission. The truck transportation\r\nsystem of the country has all but broken down. The railroads have\r\nlikewise suffered from this unbelievable phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"All machinery which involves rolling or sliding contact between metal\r\nparts has been more or less affected. Those equipped with roller\r\nbearings are holding up longer than those equipped with bushings, but\r\nall are gradually failing.\r\n\r\n\"In New York City half the power capacity has gone out of commission.\r\nSome emergency units have been thrown into operation, but these cannot\r\ncarry the load, and even some of them have failed. Elsewhere, across the\r\nnation, the story is similar. In Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis,\r\nWashington, San Francisco--the power systems are breaking down along\r\nwith motor and rail transportation.\r\n\r\n\"For some hours now, the President and his Cabinet have been in session\r\nwith dozens of scientific leaders trying to find an explanation and a\r\ncure for this disastrous failure of machinery. Rumors which were\r\nbroadcast widely this morning concerning possible effects of the comet\r\nhave been thoroughly discredited by these scientists, who call them\r\nsuperstitions belonging back in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\"One final report has just come over the air by shortwave. In the\r\nAtlantic Ocean the Italian steamer _White Bird_ has radioed frantically\r\nthat her engines are dead. Over eight hundred passengers and crew are\r\naboard.\r\n\r\n\"All ship sailings have been canceled since noon today. Vessels at sea\r\nare returning to nearest port. There is no ship available which can take\r\noff the stranded passengers and crew of the _White Bird_. She floats\r\nhelpless and alone tonight in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\"As a power-conservation measure, broadcasting on this network will\r\ncease until midnight, eastern standard time. Turn your radios off. Keep\r\nall unnecessary lights off. Avoid consumption of power in every possible\r\nway. Be with us again at midnight for the latest news and information.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a restlessness in all of Mayfield. None of the townspeople\r\nfelt like sleeping that night. Ken's group watched the comet until it\r\ndisappeared below the horizon. Some of them observed it through the\r\ntelescope. On either side of the Maddoxes' yard the voices of neighbors\r\ncould be heard under the night sky, speaking in hushed tones of the\r\nthing that had happened.\r\n\r\nMaria and Mrs. Larsen arrived, and Maria joined Ken and his friends in\r\nthe backyard. He told her what they had heard on the radio.\r\n\r\n\"That ship ...\" Maria said slowly. \"The _White Bird_, out there alone in\r\nthe ocean--what will become of all those people?\"\r\n\r\nKen shook his head slowly. \"There's no way to get to them. There's not a\r\nthing that can be done. Nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nThey remained quiet for a long time, as if each were thinking his own\r\nthoughts about the mystery and loneliness and death riding the forsaken\r\nship in the middle of the ocean, and how soon it might be that the same\r\ndark shadow settled over the cities and towns.\r\n\r\nMaria thought of her far-off homeland, and the people she knew, suddenly\r\nfrightened and helpless in their inability to get power and food.\r\n\r\nKen thought of the scenes that must be occurring in the big cities of\r\nthe United States. People everywhere would not be sleeping tonight. They\r\nwere all citizens of a civilization that was dependent for its life on\r\nturning wheels and on power surging through bright wires across hundreds\r\nof miles of open country. Without those turning wheels, and the power in\r\nthose wires there was no food, there was no warmth, there was no life.\r\n\r\nThey listened to the radio again at midnight. There was little that was\r\nnew. The President's council had found no solution, nor had they come to\r\nany decisions. Scattered riots and public disorders were springing up,\r\nboth in Europe and America. On the high seas, the captain of the _White\r\nBird_ was begging for assistance, demanding to know what had happened\r\nthat no ship could be sent to his aid.\r\n\r\nWord finally came from Ken's father and his companions that their car\r\nhad failed after leaving the dam to return home. They had reached a\r\nfarmhouse where they would spend the rest of the night. They would try\r\nto find some kind of transportation in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the early-morning hours Ken's friends drifted away, one by one, to\r\ntheir own homes, and as dawn approached, Ken finally went up to his own\r\nroom and slept. Maria and her mother, with Ken's mother, had retired\r\nonly a short time earlier.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke at 9 o'clock Ken had no idea whether or not the school\r\nofficials planned to hold classes that day, but he felt that for himself\r\nand the other members of the science club there would be no return to\r\nnormal activity for a long time. Since his father would not return for\r\nan indefinite time Ken determined to approach President Lewis of the\r\ncollege regarding the use of the idle blower and ventilation ducts in\r\nthe Science Hall.\r\n\r\nHe had met President Lewis a number of times and believed the president\r\nwould listen to him.\r\n\r\nAnother matter had disturbed Ken since last night. As soon as he was\r\nawake he called the office of Mayor Hilliard. The Mayor's secretary\r\nanswered and said, \"Mayor Hilliard is in conference. He will not be\r\navailable today.\"\r\n\r\nKen hesitated. \"Tell him it is the Maddox residence calling. I think\r\nMayor Hilliard will answer.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment the Mayor's voice boomed on the phone. Normally hearty, it\r\nwas now weighted with overtones of uncertainty and fear. \"Professor\r\nMaddox, I was just about to call you. Would you....\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not Professor Maddox,\" said Ken. \"I'm his son, Kenneth.\"\r\n\r\n\"My secretary said....\" The Mayor sounded angry now, although he knew\r\nKen well.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say my father was calling,\" said Ken. \"I've got something to\r\nsay that I think you will want to hear, and it will take only a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a day or two the entire town is going to be without power,\r\ntransportation, or communication with the outside world. The science\r\nclub of the high school has a 1000-watt amateur transmitter that can\r\nreach any point in the United States and most foreign countries. It\r\nrequires power. We can operate from batteries, and I would like to ask\r\nyou to authorize that all automobile batteries and those belonging to\r\nthe telephone company be immediately seized by the city and placed in\r\nofficial custody, to be used for emergency communication purposes only.\r\nThey should be drained of electrolyte and properly stored.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate that suggestion,\" the Mayor said. \"I think it's a good\r\none. Would you boys be able to take care of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd be glad to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your assignment, then. We are calling a town meeting tonight in\r\nthe college auditorium. We especially want your father to be there if he\r\ncan, and we'll issue orders for the battery conservation program at that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nBy noon Ken had gained an interview with President Lewis and had\r\nreceived permission for his group to make use of the largest blower on\r\nthe campus for their air-sampling project. They loaded their tools and\r\nthemselves into the ancient wagon belonging to Dave Whitaker's uncle and\r\nspent the rest of the day working at Science Hall.\r\n\r\nKen's father called again to report they had succeeded in renting a\r\nhorse and buggy at an exorbitant price from a farmer. When told of the\r\ntown meeting that evening, he promised to try to reach Mayfield in time.\r\n\r\nTen minutes before the 8 o'clock deadline, Professor Maddox drew up in\r\nfront of the house. He called to Ken without even getting down from the\r\nseat of the wagon. \"Get your mother, and let's go!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Maddox appeared, worried and concerned. \"You've had nothing to\r\neat,\" she protested. \"At least come in and have a sandwich and a glass\r\nof milk. It's not cold, but it's fresh.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Professor Maddox shook his head. \"We don't want to miss any of the\r\nmeeting. Get a coat and come along. It will be chilly later.\"\r\n\r\nMaria and her mother came also. The small wagon was loaded to capacity\r\nas it moved slowly up the hill toward the campus. People were streaming\r\ntoward the auditorium from all directions. Most of them were afoot. A\r\nfew others had found a horse and wagon. A dozen or two cars chugged\r\nprotestingly up the hill, but it appeared that most of these would not\r\nbe operating another 24 hours.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the hall, Professor Maddox chuckled and pointed a\r\nfinger ahead of them. \"Look there. I'm sure that every citizen of\r\nMayfield is present or accounted for, now.\"\r\n\r\nKen glanced in the direction of his father's gesture. The creaky wagon\r\nof Granny Wicks was drawn slowly along by her emaciated horse. Granny's\r\nstick-thin body jounced harshly on the rough seat. Ken fought against a\r\nridiculous uneasiness as he recognized her.\r\n\r\nHe knew his father had not heard Granny's speech on the post office\r\nsteps, but he was little surprised when his father said, \"I'm afraid\r\nGranny Wicks, with her profound knowledge of omens and signs, is about\r\nas much an authority on this matter as any of the rest of us here\r\ntonight!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5. _Thief_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hall was already filled. Several scores of chairs had been placed in\r\nthe corridors, and these were occupied also. People were being ushered\r\nto nearby classrooms where they would hear the proceedings over the\r\nschool's public-address system.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if we'll have to get it by remote pickup,\" said Ken. At\r\nthat moment Sally Teasdale, the Mayor's secretary, spotted their group\r\nand hurried over.\r\n\r\n\"Mayor Hilliard told me to watch for you,\" she said. \"He wants you to\r\nsit on the platform, Professor Maddox, and also Dr. Douglas and Dr.\r\nLarsen. The others of your party can sit in the wings.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox agreed and they followed Sally to the stage entrance.\r\nThe platform was already occupied by the Mayor and the town councilmen,\r\nthe college department heads, and leading citizens of Mayfield. The\r\nprofessors took their places, while Ken and the others found chairs in\r\nthe wings. It was the best seat in the house, Ken decided. They could\r\nsee both the platform and the audience below.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly the largest group that had ever gathered in one place\r\nin Mayfield. In spite of the enormous number present it was a solemn\r\ngroup. There was almost no talking or jostling. To Ken, it seemed the\r\nfaces about him had a uniform appearance of bewildered searching for\r\nreassurance that nothing could really destroy the way of life they had\r\nalways known.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard arose and called the meeting to order. \"I think everyone\r\nknows why we've been called here,\" he said. \"Because of the nature of\r\nthe circumstances I think it appropriate that we ask Dr. Aylesworth,\r\npastor of the Community Church, to offer prayer.\"\r\n\r\nHeads were bowed in reverent silence as Dr. Aylesworth stood before the\r\nassembly and offered a solemn invocation that their deliberations might\r\nreceive divine guidance, and their minds be filled with wisdom to combat\r\nthe evil that had come upon them.\r\n\r\nThe minister was a big, ruddy-faced man with a lion's mane of white\r\nhair. The unwavering authority of his voice filled the audience with the\r\nconviction that they were better prepared to face their problems when he\r\nhad resumed his seat.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard outlined the worldwide situation as he had obtained it\r\nthrough news reports up to an hour ago. He described the desperate\r\nsituation of the nation's larger cities. Their food supplies were\r\nsufficient for only a few days without any replenishment by rail and\r\ntruck transportation. Ninety percent of automobile traffic had ceased.\r\nThe railroads were attempting to conserve their rolling stock, but 70\r\npercent of it was out of commission, and the remainder could not be\r\nexpected to operate longer than a few days. Air traffic had stopped\r\nentirely. On the oceans, only sailing vessels continued to move.\r\n\r\n\"Mayfield is already cut off,\" the Mayor went on. \"Our last train went\r\nthrough here 30 hours ago. The trucking companies out of Frederick have\r\nsuspended operations. We have no cars or trucks of our own here in town,\r\non which we can depend. We're on our own.\r\n\r\n\"So far, the scientists have found no solution. Tomorrow, they may find\r\none. Or it may be 10 years before they do. In the meantime, we have to\r\nfigure out how we, here in Mayfield, are going to carry on.\r\n\r\n\"Our first consideration is, of course, food supplies. The Council met\r\nthis morning, and we have appointed a committee to take immediate\r\npossession of all foodstuffs and every facility for food production\r\nwithin the entire valley. Beginning tomorrow morning, this committee\r\nwill begin to accumulate all food supplies into one or more central\r\nwarehouses where they will be inventoried for rationing.\r\n\r\n\"All stocks of fresh meat will be salted and cured. Home supplies will\r\nbe limited to no more than a week's needs of any one item. Hoarders who\r\npersist in their unfair activities will be ordered to leave the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\"My fellow citizens, these are stringent and severe regulations, but we\r\nare not facing a time of mild inconvenience. It may well be that in this\r\ncoming winter we shall be literally fighting for our very lives. We, as\r\nyour leaders, would like a vote of confidence from you, the citizens of\r\nMayfield, as an assurance that you will co-operate with our efforts to\r\nthe best of your ability.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly, nearly everyone in the auditorium was on his feet shouting\r\nhis approval of the Mayor's program.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard had known he was taking a long chance in presenting so\r\nbluntly such a severe program, but long experience had taught him the\r\nbest way into a tough situation was a headlong plunge that ignored\r\nconsequences. The ovation surprised him. He had expected substantial\r\nopposition. Visibly moved, he held up his hand for quiet once more.\r\n\r\n\"Our farms and our livestock will be our only means of salvation after\r\npresent food stocks are gone,\" he said. \"A separate subcommittee will\r\ninventory all farmland and cattle and dairy herds and plan for their\r\nmost efficient use in the coming season. Crops will be assigned as the\r\ncommittee sees fit. Farm labor will be taken care of by all of us, on a\r\ncommunity basis.\r\n\r\n\"A third program that must begin immediately is the stockpiling of fuel\r\nfor the coming winter. Wood will be our only means of heating and\r\ncooking because the nearest mines are too far away for us to haul coal\r\nfrom them by teams. The same is true of fuel oil stocks.\r\n\r\n\"Heating will be at a minimum. Most of you do not have wood stoves. What\r\nyou have must be converted to use of wood. An additional committee will\r\nbe appointed to supervise this conversion and the construction, where\r\nnecessary, of makeshift stoves out of sheet metal, old oil barrels, and\r\nanything else of which we can make use.\"\r\n\r\nItem by item, he continued down the list of problems the Council had\r\nconsidered that day. He mentioned Ken's suggestion for conservation of\r\nbatteries. He spoke of the problems of medical care without adequate\r\nhospital facilities, of police activities that might be required in a\r\nperiod of stress such as they could expect that winter.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, members of the Council detailed plans of the\r\nseparate programs over which they had charge. President Lewis spoke to\r\npledge support of the college staff. He pointed out the fortunate fact\r\nthat they had some of the best minds in the entire country in their\r\nscientific departments, and also had Professor Larsen visiting with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe floor was turned over then to members of the audience for comment\r\nand questions. Most of them were favorable, but Sam Cluff, who owned a\r\nhundred and sixty of the best acres in the valley, stood up red-faced\r\nand belligerent.\r\n\r\n\"It's all a pack of nonsense!\" he declared. \"This is just an excuse for\r\ncertain people in this town to get their hands in somebody else's\r\npockets, and to tell other people what to do and how to live.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to have anything to do with it. Anybody who sets foot on\r\nmy land to tell me what to raise or to take my goods away is going to\r\nhave to reckon with a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any real problem, which I doubt, them Government scientists\r\nwill be on the job and get things straightened out so that trains and\r\nautomobiles will be running by next week. My advice is for everybody to\r\ngo home and let them take care of it.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard smiled tolerantly. \"I shouldn't have to remind you, Sam,\r\nthat some of the best scientists in the world are right here in our own\r\ntown, and they say the situation is serious enough for emergency\r\nmeasures. I hope you won't be foolish with that shotgun, but we're\r\ncoming out to see you, tomorrow, Sam.\"\r\n\r\nGranny Wicks seemed to erupt from her place to which she had crowded in\r\nthe center of the hall. All eyes turned at the sound of her scratchy,\r\nbirdlike voice. \"I told you,\" she shrieked. \"I told you what was coming,\r\nand now maybe you'll believe me. There's nothing you can do about it,\r\nBill Hilliard. Nothing at all. There's death in the air. The stars have\r\nspoken it. The signs are in the sky.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard interrupted her. \"Perhaps you're right, Granny,\" he said\r\ngently. \"I don't think any of us are going to argue with you tonight.\r\nWe're here to do what we can, and to make plans to stay alive just as\r\nlong as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close, Dr. Aylesworth took the stand. His commanding presence\r\nseemed to draw an aura of peace once more around the troubled group. \"We\r\nare civilized men and women,\" he said. \"Let us see that we act as such\r\nduring the months that are ahead of us. Let us remember that we may see\r\na time very soon when there will not be enough food, fuel and clothing\r\nfor all of us. When and if that time comes, let us prove that we are\r\nable to be our brother's keeper, that we are able to do unto others as\r\nwe would have others do unto us. Above all, may we be able to continue\r\nto call on divine assistance to bring a speedy end to this disaster, so\r\nthat when it is over we can look back and be proud that we conducted\r\nourselves as men and women worthy to be called civilized, and worthy of\r\nthe divine approval and aid which we now seek.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to keep classes going in the various schools as long as\r\npossible, releasing those students who were needed to take assignments\r\nin the emergency program. Ken and the rest of the science club members\r\nobtained immediate permission to devote their full time to the research\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the town meeting, Ken dressed early and rode his\r\nbicycle toward Art's garage to arrange with the mechanic the details of\r\nthe gathering and storage of automobile batteries. On the way he passed\r\nby Frank Meggs Independent Grocery Market, the largest in Mayfield.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was only a little after 7 o'clock, an enormous crowd had\r\ncollected outside and inside the store. Curious and half-alarmed, Ken\r\nparked his bicycle and made his way through the crowd. Inside, he found\r\nFrank Meggs ringing up sales of large lots of food.\r\n\r\nA red-faced woman was arguing with him at the check-out stand. \"A dollar\r\na pound for white beans! That's ridiculous, Frank Meggs, and you know\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I know it,\" the storekeeper said calmly. \"Next winter you'll be\r\nglad I let you have them for even that price. If you don't want them,\r\nMrs. Watkins, please move along. Others will be glad to have them.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated, then angrily flung two bills on the counter and\r\nstalked out with her groceries. Ken shoved his way up to the stand. \"Mr.\r\nMeggs,\" he exclaimed. \"You can't do this! All foodstuffs are being\r\ncalled in by the Mayor's committee.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to the people. \"Private hoards of food will be confiscated\r\nand placed in the community warehouse. This isn't going to do you any\r\ngood!\"\r\n\r\nMost of the shoppers looked shamefaced, at his challenge, but Meggs\r\nbristled angrily. \"You keep out of this, Maddox! Nobody asked you to\r\ncome in here! These people know what they're doing, and so do I. How\r\nmuch do you think any of us will eat if townhall gets its hands on every\r\nscrap of food in the valley? If you aren't buying, get moving!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, and I'll be back just as soon as I can find the Sheriff!\"\r\n\r\nWith telephone service now cut off to conserve battery power, Ken\r\nhesitated between seeking Sheriff Johnson at his office or at home. He\r\nchecked his watch again and decided on the Sheriff's home.\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate in arriving just before the Sheriff left. He explained\r\nquickly what was happening at Meggs' store. Johnson had been assigned\r\none of the few remaining cars that would run. With Ken, he drove\r\nimmediately to the store. They strode in, the shoppers fanning out\r\nbefore the Sheriff's approach.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, that's all,\" he said. \"You folks leave your groceries right where\r\nthey are. Tell the others they had better bring theirs back and get\r\ntheir money while Meggs still has it. Not that anybody is going to have\r\nmuch use for money, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no right to do this!\" Meggs cried. \"This is my private property\r\nand I'm entitled to do with it as I choose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any longer it isn't,\" said Sheriff Johnson. \"There isn't such a\r\nthing as private property in Mayfield, any more. Except maybe the shirt\r\non your back, and I'm not sure of that. At any rate, you're not selling\r\nthese groceries. Accounts will be kept, and when and if we get back to\r\nnormal you'll be reimbursed, but for now we're all one, big, happy\r\nfamily!\"\r\n\r\nMost of the crowd had dispersed. The armloads and pushcarts full of\r\ngroceries had been abandoned. Ken and the Sheriff moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Another trick like that and you'll spend the time of the emergency as a\r\nguest of the city. Incidentally, we don't intend to heat the jail this\r\nwinter!\"\r\n\r\nMeggs turned the blaze of his anger upon Ken. \"This is your fault!\" he\r\nsnarled. \"You and that bunch of politicians know there's not going to be\r\nany shortage this winter just as well as I do. In a week this whole\r\nthing will be straightened out. I had a chance to make a good thing of\r\nit. I'm going to get even with you if it's the last thing I ever do!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough of that!\" said Sheriff Johnson sharply. \"Come along,\r\nKen.\"\r\n\r\nKen was not disturbed by Meggs' threat of personal retaliation, but he\r\nwas frightened by the realization that Meggs wasn't the only one of his\r\nkind in Mayfield. His patrons were only a shade less unstable. What\r\nwould such people do when things really got tough? How much could they\r\nbe depended on to pull their own weight?\r\n\r\nAfter he had seen Art Matthews about collecting and storing the\r\nbatteries, Ken went up to Science Hall where the rest of the club\r\nmembers were already at work. Under the direction of Al Miner, who was\r\nthe best qualified to plan the alterations of the ventilation ducts,\r\nthey made the necessary changes and installed one of the motorcycle\r\nengines to drive the blower. At the same time, three of them built up a\r\nhigh-voltage, battery-operated power supply to charge the filter\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nBy evening the assembly was operating. The motorcycle engine chugged\r\npleasantly. \"I wonder how long before that one freezes up,\" Al said\r\npessimistically.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to get more,\" said Joe. \"The way the cars have gone we'll be\r\nlucky to get more than 2 days out of each one of these.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the day, Ken's father had directed the preparation of metallic\r\nspecimens from samples the boys had brought from Art's garage and from\r\nthose the men brought back from the power plant. With the high-powered\r\nelectron microscope, photographs were taken.\r\n\r\nAs they finished their work the boys went with Ken to the laboratory.\r\nProfessor Maddox looked up. \"Hello, Fellows,\" he said. \"Have you got\r\nyour piece of machinery running?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purring like a top,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Expected to run about as long,\" said Al.\r\n\r\n\"Have you finished any photomicrographs?\" Ken asked. \"Do they show\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\nHis father passed over a wet print. The boys gathered around it.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't mean much to me,\" said Dave Whitaker. \"Can you tell us what\r\nit shows?\"\r\n\r\nKen's father took a pencil from his pocket and touched it lightly to a\r\nbarely perceptible line across the center of the picture. \"That is the\r\nboundary,\" he said, \"between the cylinder wall and the piston taken from\r\none of the samples you brought in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see anything that looks like a line between two pieces of\r\nmetal,\" said Ted Watkins. \"It looks like one solid chunk to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is substantially what it is,\" said Professor Maddox. \"There is no\r\nlonger any real boundary as there would be between two ordinary pieces\r\nof metal. Molecules from each piece have flowed into the other, mixing\r\njust as two very viscous liquids would do. They have actually become one\r\npiece of metal.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up another photograph. \"Here you can see that the same thing has\r\nhappened in the case of the shaft and bearing samples we obtained from\r\nthe Collin's Dam power plant. Molecules of the two separate pieces of\r\nmetal have intermingled, becoming one single piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could they do that?\" Ken exclaimed. \"Metals can't flow like\r\nliquids.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can if the conditions are right. When steel is heated to a\r\nsufficiently high temperature, it flows like water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's not the case here!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't, of course. At lower temperatures the molecules of a solid\r\ndo not possess the energy of motion which they have in a liquid state.\r\nThe metallic surface of a piece of cold steel has a certain surface\r\ntension which prevents the escape of the relatively low-energy\r\nmolecules; thus it has the characteristics we ascribe to a solid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what has happened in this case?\" Joe asked. \"Are you able to\r\ntell?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox nodded. \"The photographs show us what has happened, but\r\nthey reveal nothing about how or why. We can see the surface tension of\r\nthe two pieces of metal has obviously broken down so that the small\r\nenergy of motion possessed by the molecules has permitted them to move\r\ntoward each other, with a consequent mixing of the two metals. It has\r\nturned them quite literally into a single piece, the most effective kind\r\nof weld you can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would cause the surface tension to break down like that?\" Ken\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"That is what remains for us to find out. We don't have the faintest\r\nidea what has caused it. It becomes especially baffling when we recall\r\nthat it has happened, not in a single isolated instance, but all over\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would think the metals would have become soft, like putty, or\r\nsomething, for a thing like that to happen to them,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"It would be expected that the hardness would be affected. This is not\r\ntrue, however. The metals seem just as hard as before. The effect of\r\nmixing seems to take place only when the metals are in sliding motion\r\nagainst one another, as in the case of a piston and cylinder, or a shaft\r\nand a bearing. The effect is comparatively slow, taking place over a\r\nnumber of days. The two surfaces must break down gradually, increasing\r\nthe friction to a point where motion must cease. Then the mixing\r\ncontinues until they are welded solidly to each other.\"\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the dusk of evening would have fallen over the landscape,\r\nbut the blaze of the comet now lit the countryside with an unnatural\r\ngold that reflected like a flame through the windows and onto the faces\r\nof the men and boys in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"As to the cause of this phenomenon,\" Professor Maddox said with an\r\nobviously weary deliberation in his voice, \"we can only hope to find an\r\nexplanation and a cure before it is too late to do the world any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"There can't be any question of that!\" said Ken intensely. \"The\r\nresources of the whole scientific world will be turned on this one\r\nproblem. Every industrial, university, and governmental laboratory will\r\nbe working on it. Modern science can certainly lick a thing like this!\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox turned from the window, which he had been facing. A\r\nfaint, grim smile touched the corners of his lips and died as he\r\nregarded the boys, especially Ken. His face took on a depth of soberness\r\nKen seldom saw in his father.\r\n\r\n\"You think nothing is immune to an attack by so-called modern science?\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" Ken went on enthusiastically, not understanding the expression\r\non his father's face. \"Look at the problems that have been licked as\r\nsoon as people were determined enough and willing to pay the cost. Giant\r\ncomputers, radar eyes, atomic energy. Everybody knows we could have made\r\nit to Mars by now if governments had been willing to put up the\r\nnecessary money.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still have to learn, all of you do,\" Professor Maddox said slowly,\r\n\"that the thing we call science is only a myth. The only reality\r\nconsists of human beings trying to solve difficult problems. Their\r\nresults, which seem to be solutions to some of those problems, we call\r\nscience. Science has no life of its own. It does not deserve to be\r\nspoken of as an entity in its own right. There are only people, whom we\r\ncall scientists, and their accomplishments are severely limited by their\r\nquite meager abilities. Meager, when viewed in comparison with the\r\nmagnitude of the problems they attack.\"\r\n\r\nKen felt bewildered. He had never heard his father speak this way\r\nbefore. \"Don't you believe there are scientists enough--scientists who\r\nknow enough--to lick a thing like this in time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I'm quite sure no one knows. We became conscious long ago\r\nof the fallacy of assuming that the concentration of men enough and\r\nunlimited funds would solve any problem in the world. For every great\r\naccomplishment like atomic energy, to which we point with pride, there\r\nare a thousand other problems, equally important, that remain unsolved.\r\nWho knows whether or not this problem of weakened surface tension in\r\nmetals is one of the insoluble ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to find an answer,\" said Ken doggedly. He could not understand\r\nhis father's words. \"There's nothing science can't accomplish if it sets\r\nabout it with enough determination. Nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6. _The Scientist_\r\n\r\n\r\nKen spent an almost sleepless night. He tossed for long hours and dozed\r\nfinally, but he awoke again before there was even a trace of dawn in the\r\nsky. Although the night was cool he was sweating as if it were\r\nmid-summer.\r\n\r\nThere was a queasiness in his stomach, too, a slow undefinable pressure\r\non some hidden nerve he had never known he possessed. The feeling pulsed\r\nand throbbed slowly and painfully. He sat up and looked out at the dark\r\nlandscape, and he knew what was the matter.\r\n\r\nScared, he thought, I'm scared sick.\r\n\r\nHe'd never known anything like it before in his life, except maybe the\r\ntime when he was 6 years old and he had climbed to the top of a very\r\nhigh tree when the wind was blowing, and he had been afraid to come\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIt was hitting him, he thought. He was just beginning to understand what\r\nthis stoppage of machinery really meant, and he wondered if there was\r\nsomething wrong with him that he had not felt it earlier. Was he alone?\r\nHad everyone else understood it before he had? Or would it hit them,\r\none by one, just as it was hitting him now, bringing him face to face\r\nwith what lay ahead.\r\n\r\nHe knew what had done it. It was his father's expression and his words\r\nin the laboratory the night before.\r\n\r\nKen recognized that he had never doubted for an instant that scientists\r\nand their tools were wholly adequate to solve this problem in a\r\nreasonable time. He had been aware there would be great hardships, but\r\nhe had never doubted there would be an end to that time. He had believed\r\nhis father, as a scientist, had the same faith.\r\n\r\nIt was a staggering shock to learn that his father had no faith in\r\nscience; a shock to be told that science was not a thing that warranted\r\na man's faith. Ken had planned his whole life around an avid faith in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nHe tried to imagine what the world would be like if no engine should\r\never run again. The standards of civilized existence would be shattered.\r\nOnly those areas of the world, where people had never learned to depend\r\non motor transportation or electric power, would be unaffected; those\r\nareas of China, India and Africa, where men still scratched the ground\r\nwith a forked stick and asked only for a cup of rice or grain each day.\r\n\r\nThis would become the level of the whole world. Until last night, Ken\r\nhad never believed it remotely possible. Now, his father's words had\r\nshaken him out of the certainty that science would avert such\r\nconsequences. It _could_ happen.\r\n\r\nHe thought of his own plans and ambitions. There would be no need for\r\nscientists, nor the opportunity to become one, in a world of men who\r\ngrubbed the land with forked sticks. He felt a sudden blind and bitter\r\nanger. Even if the disaster were overcome in a matter of years, his\r\nopportunity would be gone.\r\n\r\nHe knew at once that such anger was selfish and futile. His own personal\r\ncalamities would be the least of the troubles ahead, but, for the\r\nmoment, he could not help it. In a way, it felt good because it\r\novershadowed the dark fear that still throbbed in his body.\r\n\r\nBut something else was gone, too. The opportunity for him and his\r\nscience club friends to investigate the properties of the altered metal\r\nwas over. His father and the other scientists had taken over those\r\nstudies, and there would be no place for high-school boys who did not\r\nknow even enough to prepare a slide for an electron microscope.\r\n\r\nIt had always been that way, as long as he could remember. He had always\r\nbeen too young and too ignorant to be intrusted with work that mattered.\r\n\r\nHe supposed they would turn the operation of the air filter over to one\r\nof the teaching fellows, even though that was something the club could\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness and the fear seemed more than he could endure. He dressed\r\nquietly and went downstairs. Without lighting a lamp, he found something\r\nto eat. The first light of dawn was showing when he left the house.\r\n\r\nFor an hour he walked the silent streets without meeting anyone.\r\nNormally, there would have been the sound of milk trucks, and the cars\r\nof early-rising workers. Now there was nothing. The comet had risen just\r\nabove the eastern hills, and in its light the city was like some\r\nfabulous, golden ruin that belonged in an ancient fairytale.\r\n\r\nKen didn't know where he was going or what he was going to do. There\r\nought to be something useful he could do, he thought fiercely.\r\n\r\nAs he looked down the street, he saw a half-dozen wagons with two teams\r\neach, stopped in front of Sims Hardware and Lumber. In the wagons were\r\nseveral dozen men. Ken recognized Andrew Norton, of the Mayor's Council,\r\nand Henry Atkins, the Sheriff's chief deputy.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men were emerging from the hardware store with new axes\r\nand saws. Then Ken understood. This was the first wood detail headed\r\nfor the mountains to begin gathering and stockpiling fuel for the\r\nwinter. He broke into a run.\r\n\r\nDeputy Atkins appeared to be in charge of the group. Ken hailed him. \"I\r\nwant to go along, Mr. Atkins. May I go?\"\r\n\r\nThe deputy glanced down at him and frowned. He consulted a sheet of\r\npaper he drew from his pocket. \"Your name isn't on the list for this\r\nmorning, Ken. Were you assigned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess not, but I haven't got anything else to do today. Is there any\r\nobjection to my going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose so,\" said Atkins dubiously. \"It's just that your name\r\nmay be on some other list. We don't want to get these things fouled up\r\nright off the bat. There's enough trouble as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure my name's not on any other list. I'd have been told about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Climb on.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ken climbed into the nearest wagon he was startled to find himself\r\nstaring into the face of Frank Meggs. The storekeeper grinned\r\nunpleasantly as he nodded his head in Ken's direction and spoke to his\r\nneighbor. \"Now what do you know about that? Old Man Maddox, letting his\r\nown little boy out alone this early in the morning. I'll bet he didn't\r\nlet you, did he? I'll bet you had to run away to try to prove you're a\r\nbig boy now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it out, Meggs,\" said Atkins sharply. \"We heard all about what went\r\non in your store yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nThe man next to Meggs drew away, but it didn't seem to bother him. He\r\ncontinued to grin crookedly at Ken. \"Aren't you afraid you might get\r\nhurt trying to do a man's work?\"\r\n\r\nKen ignored the jibes and faced away from the storekeeper. The slow,\r\nrhythmic jogging of the wagon, and the frosty air as they came into the\r\nmountains took some of the bitterness out of Ken. It made him feel\r\nfreshly alive. He had come often to hunt here and felt a familiarity\r\nwith every tree and rock around him.\r\n\r\nThe wagon train came to a halt in a grove of 10-year-old saplings that\r\nneeded thinning.\r\n\r\n\"No use taking our best timber until we have to,\" said Atkins. \"We'll\r\nstart here. I'll take a crew and go on ahead and mark the ones to be\r\ncut. You drivers unhitch your teams and drag the logs out to the wagons\r\nafter they're cut.\"\r\n\r\nThere was none of the kidding and horseplay that would have been normal\r\nin such a group. Each man seemed intent on the purpose for which he had\r\ncome, and was absorbed with his own thoughts. Ken took a double-bitted\r\nax and followed Atkins along the trail. He moved away from the others\r\nand began cutting one of the young trees Atkins had marked.\r\n\r\nBy noon he was bathed in sweat, and his arms and back ached. He had\r\nthought he was in good condition from his football and track work, but\r\nhe seemed to have found new muscles that had never come into play\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAtkins noticed the amount he had cut and complimented him. \"Better take\r\nit easy. You're way ahead of everybody else, and we don't have to get it\r\nall out today.\"\r\n\r\nKen grinned, enjoying the aches of his muscles. \"If it has to be done we\r\nmight as well do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not surprised to find that Frank Meggs had cut almost nothing but\r\nhad spent his time complaining to his companions about the unnecessary\r\nwork they were doing.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, which Ken had reluctantly accepted from the others, there\r\nwas a stir at the arrival of a newcomer on horseback. Ken recognized him\r\nas Mike Travis, one of the carpenters and caretakers at the college.\r\n\r\nMike tied his horse to the tailboard of a wagon and approached the\r\nwoodcutters. \"There you are, Ken Maddox,\" he said accusingly. \"Why\r\ndidn't you let somebody know where you were going? Your father's been\r\nchewing up everyone in sight, trying to find out where you'd gone. He\r\nfinally decided you might be up here, and sent me after you. Take the\r\nhorse on back. I'll finish up the day on the wood detail.\"\r\n\r\nKen felt suddenly awkward and uncomfortable. \"I didn't mean to worry\r\nhim, but I guess I did forget to say where I was going. Don't you think\r\nit would be okay if I stayed and you told Dad you had found me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life! He'd chew me down to the ankles if I went back\r\nwithout you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I'll go,\" Ken said. Although he knew he should have left word it\r\nstill seemed strange that his father should be so concerned as to send a\r\nman up here looking for him. It seemed like more of the unfamiliar\r\nfacets of his father's personality that Ken had glimpsed last night.\r\n\r\nFrank Meggs was watching from across the clearing. \"I guess Papa Maddox\r\ncouldn't stand the thought of his little boy doing a man's work for a\r\nwhole day,\" he said loudly and maliciously. No one paid any attention to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKen tied the mare to a tree on the campus where she could graze. He\r\nglanced over the valley below. Not a single car was in sight on the\r\nroads. Somehow, it was beginning to seem that this was the way it had\r\nalways been. His own car seemed like something he had possessed a\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\nHe found his father in the laboratory working with the electron\r\nmicroscope. Professor Maddox looked up and gestured toward the office.\r\nAs Ken sat down, he shut the door behind them and took a seat behind his\r\nold oak desk that was still cluttered with unmarked examination papers.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't say anything about where you were going this morning,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" Ken answered. \"I got up early and took a walk\r\nthrough town. All of a sudden--well, I guess I got panicky when it\r\nfinally hit me as to what all this really means. I saw the wood detail\r\ngoing out and joined them. It felt good out there, with nothing to think\r\nabout except getting a tree to fall right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ran away. You were needed here.\"\r\n\r\nKen stammered. \"I didn't think you wanted any of us kids around since\r\nyou and the other men had taken over what we had started to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were angry that it wasn't your own show any longer, weren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's part of it,\" Ken admitted, his face reddening. He didn't\r\nknow what was happening. His father had never spoken to him like this\r\nbefore. He seemed suddenly critical and disapproving of everything about\r\nKen.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time his father spoke again, more gently this time. \"It's\r\nbeen your ambition for a long time to be a scientist, hasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been very pleased, too. I've watched you and encouraged your\r\ninterests and, as far as I can see, you've been developing in the right\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you think so,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\n\"But you've wanted to be a _great_ scientist. You've had an ambition to\r\nemulate men like Newton, Faraday, Davy, and the modern giants such as\r\nEinstein, Planck, de Broglie, Oppenheimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I haven't got the brains, but I can try.\"\r\n\r\nHis father snorted impatiently. \"Do you think any one of them tried\r\ndeliberately to be great, or to copy anyone else?\"\r\n\r\nKen understood his meaning now. \"I guess they didn't. You can't really\r\ndo a thing like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't. You take the brains God has given you and apply them to\r\nthe universe as you see it. The results take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Some of us have enough insight to achieve greatness. Most of us lack\r\nthe cleverness to cope effectively with such a wily opponent as the\r\nnatural universe. Greatness and mediocrity have no meaning to a man who\r\nis absorbed in his study. You do what you have to do. You do what the\r\nbest and highest impulses of your brain tell you to do. Expect nothing\r\nmore than this of yourself. Nothing more is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I see what you mean,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it. Most of the men I know have never learned it. They struggle\r\nto write more papers, to get their names in more journals than their\r\ncolleagues. They go out of their way to be patted on the back.\r\n\r\n\"They are the failures as scientists. For an example of success I\r\nrecommend that you observe Dr. Larsen closely. He is a man who has done\r\na great deal to advance our knowledge of physical chemistry.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox paused. Then he said finally, \"There is just one other\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" Ken asked.\r\n\r\n\"Up to now, you and all your friends have only played at science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Played!\" Ken cried. \"We've built our observatory, a 1000-watt radio\r\ntransmitter--\"\r\n\r\n\"Play; these things are toys. Educational toys, it is true, but toys,\r\nnevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toys are fine for children. You and your friends, however, are no\r\nlonger children. You haven't got a chance now to grow up and gain an\r\neducation in a normal manner. You can't finish your childhood, playing\r\nwith your toys. You can't take all the time you need to find out what\r\nyour capacities and aptitudes are. You will never know a world that will\r\nallow you that luxury.\r\n\r\n\"Every available brain is needed on this problem. You've got to make a\r\ndecision today, this very minute, whether you want to give a hand to its\r\nsolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I want to be in on it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you? Then you've got to decide that you are no longer concerned\r\nabout being a scientist. Forget the word. What you are does not matter.\r\nYou are simply a man with a problem to solve.\r\n\r\n\"You have to decide whether or not you can abandon your compassion for\r\nthe millions who are going to die; whether you can reject all pressure\r\nfrom personal danger, and from the threat to everything and everyone\r\nthat is of any importance to you.\r\n\r\n\"You've got to decide whether or not this problem of the destruction of\r\nsurface tension of metals is the most absorbing thing in the whole\r\nworld. It needs solving, not because the fate of the world hinges on it,\r\nbut because it's a problem that consumes you utterly. This is what\r\ndrives you, not fear, not danger, not the opinion of anyone else.\r\n\r\n\"When he can function this way, the scientist is capable of solving\r\nimportant problems. By outward heartlessness he can achieve works of\r\ncompassion greater than any of his critics. He knows that the greatest\r\npleasure a man can know lies in taking a stand against those forces that\r\nbend ordinary men.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Ken suddenly felt that he knew his\r\nfather. \"I wish you had talked to me like this a long time ago,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox shook his head. \"It would have been far better for you\r\nto find out these things for yourself. My telling you does not convince\r\nyou they are true. That conviction must still come from within.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to become a scientist?\" Ken asked.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't make any difference what I want,\" his father answered almost\r\nroughly. He was looking away from Ken and then his eyes found his son's\r\nand his glance softened. He reached across the desk and grasped Ken's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I want it more than anything else in the world,\" he said\r\nearnestly. \"But it's got to be what you want, too, or it's no good at\r\nall. Don't try to be anything for my sake. Determine your own goals\r\nclearly, and take as straight a path as you can to reach them. Just\r\nremember, if you do choose science the standards are severe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what I want,\" said Ken evenly. \"You said you needed me here. What\r\ndo you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Empty trash cans if we ask it,\" Professor Maddox said. \"Forget about\r\nwhose show it is. Professor Larsen and I will be directing the research,\r\nand we'll need every pair of hands and every brain that's got an ounce\r\nof intelligence in this field. You do whatever you are asked to do and\r\nthink of every possible answer to the questions that come before you. Is\r\nthat good enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than enough.\" Ken felt a sudden stinging sensation behind his eyes\r\nand turned to rub their corners roughly. \"What about the other fellows\r\nin the club? Can you use them, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"As many as have the ounce of intelligence I spoke of. The rest of them\r\ndon't need to know the things I have told you, but with you it was\r\ndifferent. I had to know you understood just a little of what it means\r\nto be a scientist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be one. I'll show you I can be one!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7. _Dust from the Stars_\r\n\r\n\r\nKen felt he had grown 3 inches taller after his father's discussion. As\r\nif he had passed some ancient ritual, he could be admitted to the\r\ncompany of adults and his opinions would be heard.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be true. His father rapidly organized the facilities of\r\nthe college laboratories and recruited every possible science student in\r\nthe chemistry and physics departments, as well as many from the high\r\nschool. As these plans were outlined, Ken made a proposal of his own.\r\n\r\n\"I believe our first move,\" he said, \"should be to set up a network of\r\namateur radio stations operating in cities where there are other\r\nlaboratories. If you could be in touch with them, ideas could be\r\nexchanged and duplication of work avoided.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent idea,\" said Professor Maddox. \"You can work it out as we\r\ngo along.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It ought to be done immediately,\" Ken said. \"If not, it may be\r\nalmost impossible to find anyone on the air later. There may not be many\r\namateurs who will bother to convert their rigs to battery operation.\r\nThere may not be many who can get the batteries together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough!\" his father said. \"Let that have priority over everything\r\nelse until you get it organized. Probably you should find at least two\r\ncontacts in each of the university centers. Put at the top of your list\r\nBerkeley, Pasadena, Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\"See if you can get relay contacts that will put us in touch with\r\nStockholm, Paris, London, Berlin, and Tokyo. If so, we can have contact\r\nwith the majority of the workers capable of contributing most to this\r\nproblem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" Ken promised.\r\n\r\nSomeone would be needed to operate the station and spend a good many\r\nhours a week listening and recording. He didn't want to spend the time\r\nnecessary doing that, and he knew none of the other club members would,\r\neither. At once he thought of Maria Larsen. She would undoubtedly be\r\nhappy to take over the job and feel she was doing something useful. On\r\nthe way home he stopped at her house and told her what he had in mind.\r\nShe readily agreed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about radio,\" she said. \"You'll have to show me\r\nwhat to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't expect you to learn code, of course,\" he said. \"When we do\r\nhandle anything coming in by code one of us will have to take it. We'll\r\ntry to contact phone stations wherever possible for this program we have\r\nin mind. Most of the stuff will be put on tape, and Dad will probably\r\nwant you to prepare typed copies, too. You can do enough to take a big\r\nload off the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be happy to try.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent the rest of the day in the radio room of the science shack.\r\nKen taught Maria the simple operations of turning on the transmitter and\r\nreceiver, of handling the tuning controls, and the proper procedure for\r\nmaking and receiving calls. He supposed there would be some technical\r\nobjection to her operation of the station without an operator's license,\r\nbut he was quite sure that such things were not important right now.\r\n\r\nIt was a new kind of experience for Maria. Her face was alive with\r\nexcitement as Ken checked several bands to see where amateurs were still\r\noperating. The babble of high-frequency code whistles alternated in the\r\nroom with faint, sometimes muffled voices on the phone band.\r\n\r\n\"There are more stations than I expected,\" Ken said. \"With luck, we may\r\nbe able to establish a few of the contacts we need, tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAfter many tries, he succeeded in raising an operator, W6YRE, in San\r\nFrancisco. They traded news, and it sounded as if the west coast city\r\nwas crumbling swiftly. Ken explained what he wanted. W6YRE promised to\r\ntry to raise someone with a high-powered phone rig in Berkeley, near the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nThey listened to him calling, but could not hear the station he finally\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\"What good will that do?\" Maria asked. \"If we can't hear the station in\r\nBerkeley....\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be working on a relay deal through the small rig. It's better\r\nthan nothing, but I'd prefer a station we can contact directly.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, the San Francisco operator called them back. \"W6WGU\r\nknows a ham with a 1000-watt phone near the university,\" he said. \"He\r\nthinks he'll go for your deal, but he's not set up for battery. In fact,\r\nhe's about ready to evacuate. Maybe he can be persuaded to stay. I'm\r\ntold he's a guy who will do the noble thing if he sees a reason for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's plenty of reason for this,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Let's set a schedule for 9 p.m. I ought to have word on it by then.\"\r\n\r\nThey agreed and cut off. In another hour they had managed a contact with\r\na Chicago operator, and explained what they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"You're out of luck here,\" the ham replied. \"This town is falling apart\r\nat the seams right now. The whole Loop area has been burned out.\r\nThere's been rioting for 18 hours straight. The militia have been trying\r\nto hold things together, but I don't think they even know whether\r\nanybody is still on top giving the orders.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to find out what the eggheads at the university are doing, but\r\nif they've got any kind of research running in this mess, it'll surprise\r\nme. If they are still there, I'll hang on and report to you. Otherwise,\r\nI'm heading north. There's not much sense to it, but when something like\r\nthis happens a guy's got to run or have a good reason for staying put.\r\nIf he doesn't he'll go nuts.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago operator agreed to a schedule for the following morning.\r\n\r\nMaria and Ken sat in silence, not looking at each other, after they cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"It will be that way in all the big cities, won't it?\" Maria asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so. We're luckier than they are,\" Ken said, \"but I wonder\r\nhow long we'll stay lucky.\" He was thinking of Frank Meggs, and the\r\npeople who had swamped his store.\r\n\r\nAt 9 p.m., W6YRE came back on. The Berkeley 1000-watt phone was\r\nenthusiastic about being a contact post with the university people. He\r\nhad promised to make arrangements with them and to round up enough\r\nbatteries to convert his transmitter and receiver.\r\n\r\nThey had no further success that night.\r\n\r\nKen's father shook his head sadly when told of the situation in Chicago.\r\n\"I had counted on them,\" he said. \"Their people are among the best in\r\nthe world, and they have the finest equipment. I hope things are not\r\nlike that everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nMembers of the science club took turns at the transmitter the following\r\ndays for 20-hour stretches, until everything possible had been done to\r\nestablish the contacts requested by Professor Maddox.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago there appeared to have been a complete collapse. The operator\r\nthere reported he was unable to reach any of the scientific personnel at\r\nthe university. He promised a further contact, but when the time came he\r\ncould not be reached. There was no voice at all in the Chicago area. Ken\r\nwondered what had become of the man whose voice they had heard briefly.\r\nHe was certain he would never know.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was much disorder on the west coast, the situation was in\r\nsomewhat better control. The rioting had not yet threatened the\r\nuniversities, and both Berkeley and Pasadena were working frantically on\r\nthe problem with round-the-clock shifts in their laboratories. They had\r\nwelcomed wholeheartedly the communication network initiated by the\r\nMayfield group.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, D.C. tight military control was keeping things somewhat\r\nin order. In Stockholm, where contact had been established through a\r\nWashington relay after 2 days of steady effort, there was no rioting\r\nwhatever. Paris and London had suffered, but their leading universities\r\nwere at work on the problem. Tokyo reported similar conditions.\r\n\r\nKen grinned at Maria as they received the Stockholm report. \"Those\r\nSwedes,\" he said. \"They're pretty good at keeping their heads.\"\r\n\r\nMaria answered with a faint smile of her own. \"Everybody should be\r\nSwedes. No?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fall winds and the black frost came early that year, as if in fair\r\nwarning that the winter intended a brutal assault upon the stricken\r\nworld. The pile of logs in the community woodlot grew steadily. A large\r\ncrew of men worked to reduce the logs to stove lengths.\r\n\r\nThey had made a crude attempt to set up a circular saw, using animal\r\npower to drive it. The shaft was mounted in hardwood blocks, driven by a\r\ncomplicated arrangement of wooden pulleys and leather belts. The horses\r\nworked it through a treadmill.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus worked part of the time, but it scarcely paid for itself\r\nwhen measured against the efforts of the men who had to keep it in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\nThe food storage program was well underway. Two central warehouses had\r\nbeen prepared from the converted Empire Movie Theater, and the Rainbow\r\nSkating Rink.\r\n\r\nKen wished their efforts at the college laboratory were going half as\r\nwell. As the days passed, it seemed they were getting nowhere. The first\r\neffort to identify any foreign substance in the atmospheric dust was a\r\nfailure. Calculations showed they had probably not allowed sufficient\r\ntime to sample a large enough volume of air.\r\n\r\nIt was getting increasingly difficult to keep the blower system going.\r\nAll of their original supply of small engines had broken down. The town\r\nhad been scoured for replacements. These, too, were failing.\r\n\r\nIn the metallurgical department hundreds of tests had been run on\r\nsamples taken from frozen engines. The photomicrographs all showed a\r\nuniform peculiarity, which the scientists could not explain. Embedded in\r\nthe crystalline structure of the metal were what appeared to be some\r\nkind of foreign, amorphous particles which were concentrated near the\r\nline of union of the two parts.\r\n\r\nBerkeley and Pasadena confirmed these results with their own tests.\r\nThere was almost unanimous belief that it was in no way connected with\r\nthe comet. Ken stood almost alone in his dogged conviction that the\r\nEarth's presence in the tail of the comet could be responsible for the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nAnother theory that was gaining increasing acceptance was that this\r\nforeign substance was an unexpected by-product of the hydrogen and\r\natomic bomb testing that had been going on for so many years. Ken was\r\nforced to admit the possibility of this, inasmuch as radiation products\r\nwere scattered heavily now throughout the Earth's atmosphere. Both\r\nRussia and Britain had conducted extensive tests just before the\r\nbreakdowns began occurring.\r\n\r\nThe members of the science club had been allowed to retain complete\r\ncontrol of the air-sampling program. They washed the filters carefully\r\nat intervals and distilled the solvent to recover the precious residue\r\nof dust.\r\n\r\nAs the small quantity of this grew after another week of collecting, it\r\nwas treated to remove the ordinary carbon particles and accumulated\r\npollens. When this was done there was very little remaining, but that\r\nlittle something might be ordinary dust carried into the atmosphere from\r\nthe surface of the Earth. Or it might be out of the tail of the comet.\r\nDust from the stars.\r\n\r\nBy now, Ken and his companions had learned the use of the electron\r\nmicroscope and how to prepare specimens for it. When their samples of\r\ndust had become sufficient they prepared a dozen slides for\r\nphotographing with the instrument.\r\n\r\nAs these were at last developed in the darkroom, Ken scanned them\r\neagerly. Actually, he did not know what he was looking for. None of them\r\ndid. The prints seemed to show little more than shapeless patches. In\r\nthe light of the laboratory he called Joe Walton's attention to one\r\npicture. \"Look,\" he said. \"Ever see anything like that before?\"\r\n\r\nJoe started to shake his head. Then he gave an exclamation. \"Hey, they\r\nlook like the same particles found in the metals, which nobody has been\r\nable to identify yet!\"\r\n\r\nKen nodded. \"It could be. Maybe this will get us only a horselaugh for\r\nour trouble, but let's see what they think.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the next laboratory and laid the prints before Ken's\r\nfather and his associates. Ken knew at once, from the expressions on the\r\nmen's faces, that they were not going to be laughed at.\r\n\r\n\"I think there may be something here,\" said Professor Maddox, trying to\r\nsuppress his excitement. \"It is very difficult to tell in a picture like\r\nthis whether one particle is similar to any other, but their size and\r\nconfiguration are very much alike.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Douglas grunted disdainfully. \"Impossible!\" With that\r\ndismissal, he moved away.\r\n\r\nProfessor Larsen looked more carefully. \"You could scrape dust from a\r\nthousand different sources and get pictures like this from half of them\r\nperhaps. Only the chemical tests will show us the nature of this\r\nmaterial. I am certain it is very worthwhile following up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel certain that whatever contaminating agent we are dealing with is\r\nairborne,\" said Professor Maddox. \"If this is the same substance it will\r\nnot tell us its origin, of course, nor will it even prove it is\r\nresponsible for these effects. However it is a step in the right\r\ndirection. We can certainly stand that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we tell by spectroscopic analysis?\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"That would be difficult to say. The commonness of the elements involved\r\nmight mask what you are looking for. Get John Vickers to help you set up\r\nequipment for making some comparisons.\"\r\n\r\nVickers was the teaching fellow in the chemistry department whom\r\nProfessor Maddox had planned to assign to help the boys when they first\r\nsuggested atmospheric analysis. He had become indispensable in the\r\nresearch since then. But he liked helping the boys; it was not too long\r\nsince he had been at the same stage in his own career. He understood\r\ntheir longing to do something worthwhile, and their embarrassment at\r\ntheir ineptness.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Guys,\" he said, when Professor Maddox called him in. \"Let's see\r\nif we can find out what this stuff is. Who knows? Maybe we've got a bear\r\nby the tail.\"\r\n\r\nIt was delicate precision work, preparing specimens and obtaining\r\nspectrographs of the lines that represented the elements contained in\r\nthem. Time after time, their efforts failed. Something went wrong either\r\nwith their sample preparation, or with their manipulation of the\r\ninstruments. Ken began to feel as if their hands possessed nothing but\r\nthumbs.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way it goes,\" John Vickers consoled them. \"Half of this\r\nbusiness of being a scientist is knowing how to screw a nut on a\r\nleft-handed bolt in the dark. Unless you're one of these guys who do it\r\nall in their heads, like Einstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're wasting our samples,\" Ken said. \"It's taken two weeks to collect\r\nthis much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this is the one that does it,\" said Vickers. \"Try it now.\"\r\n\r\nKen turned the switch that illuminated the spectrum and exposed the\r\nphotographic plate. After a moment, he cut it off. \"That had better do\r\nit!\" he said.\r\n\r\nAfter the plates were developed, they had two successful spectrographs\r\nfor comparison. One was taken from the metal of a failed-engine part.\r\nThe other was from the atmospheric dust. In the comparator Vickers\r\nbrought the corresponding standard comparison lines together. For a long\r\ntime he peered through the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of lines match up,\" he said. \"I can throw out most of them,\r\nthough--carbon, oxygen, a faint sodium.\"\r\n\r\n\"The stuff that's giving us trouble might be a compound of one of\r\nthese,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"That's right. If so, we ought to find matching lines of other possible\r\nelements in the compounds concerned. I don't see any reasonable\r\ncombination at all.\" He paused. \"Hey, here's something I hadn't\r\nnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nHe shifted the picture to the heavy end of the spectrum. There, a very\r\nsharp line matched on both pictures. The boys took a look at it through\r\nthe viewer. \"What is that one?\" Ken asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I used a carbon standard. I should have used one farther\r\ntoward the heavy end. This one looks like it would have to be a\r\ntransuranic element, something entirely new, like plutonium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it could be from the hydrogen bomb tests,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"It could be,\" said Vickers, \"but somehow I've got a feeling it isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there a quick way to find out?\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we took a spectrograph of the comet and found this same line\r\nstrongly present, we would have a good case for proving the comet was\r\nthe source of this substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a try,\" said Vickers. \"I don't know how successfully we can\r\nget a spectrograph of the comet, but it's worth an attempt.\"\r\n\r\nTheir time was short, before the comet vanished below the horizon for\r\nthe night. They called for help from the other boys and moved the\r\nequipment to the roof, using the small, portable 6-inch telescope\r\nbelonging to the physics department.\r\n\r\nThere was time for only one exposure. After the sun had set, and the\r\ncomet had dropped below the horizon, they came out of the darkroom and\r\nplaced the prints in the viewing instrument.\r\n\r\nVickers moved the adjustments gently. After a time he looked up at the\r\ncircle of boys. \"You were right, Ken,\" he said. \"Your hunch was right.\r\nThe comet is responsible. Our engines have been stopped by dust from the\r\nstars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8. _Attack_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are people who feed upon disaster and grow in their own particular\r\ndirection as they would never have grown without it, as does the queen\r\nbee who becomes queen only because of the special food prepared by the\r\nworkers for her private use.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was Henry Maddox. He would not have admitted it, nor was he\r\never able to realize it, for it violated the very principles he had laid\r\ndown for Ken. But for him, the comet was like a sudden burst of purpose\r\nin his life. He had taught well in his career as professor of chemistry\r\nat the State Agricultural College at Mayfield, but it had become fairly\r\nmechanical. He was vaguely aware of straining at the chains of routine\r\nfrom time to time, but he had always forced himself through sheer\r\nexercise of will to attend to his duties. There was never time, however,\r\nfor any of the research he used to tell himself, in his younger days, he\r\nwas going to do.\r\n\r\nWith the sudden thrusting aside of all customary duties, and with the\r\nimpact of catastrophe demanding a solution to a research problem, he\r\ncame alive without knowing what was happening. Yet without the imminence\r\nof disaster he would not have found the strength to drive himself so.\r\nThis was what he could not admit to himself.\r\n\r\nAnother who was nourished was Granny Wicks. She should have been dead\r\nyears ago. She had admitted this to herself and to anyone else who would\r\nlisten, but now she knew why she had been kept alive so long past her\r\ntime. She had been waiting for the comet.\r\n\r\nIts energy seemed to flow from the sky into her withered, bony frame,\r\nand she drank of its substance until time seemed to reverse itself in\r\nher obsolete body. All her life she had been waiting for this time. She\r\nknew it now. She was spared to tell the people why the comet had come.\r\nAlthough her purpose was diametrically opposed to that of Henry Maddox,\r\nshe also fed and grew to her full stature after almost a century of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nFrank Meggs was surely another. He was born in Mayfield and had lived\r\nthere all his life and he hated every minute of time and every person\r\nand every event that told of his wasted life here. He hated College\r\nHill, for he had never been able to go there. His family had been too\r\npoor, and he had been forced to take over his father's store when his\r\nfather died.\r\n\r\nHe had once dreamed of becoming a great businessman and owning a chain\r\nof stores that would stretch from coast to coast, but circumstances, for\r\nwhich he blamed the whole of Mayfield, had never permitted him to leave\r\nthe town. His panic sale had been his final, explosive hope that he\r\nmight be able to make it. Now, he, too, found himself growing in his own\r\nspecial direction as he fed upon the disaster. He did not know just what\r\nthat direction was or to where it led, but he felt the growth. He felt\r\nthe secret pleasure of contemplating the discomfort and the privation\r\nthat lay ahead for his fellow citizens in the coming months.\r\n\r\nWhile personal fear forced him to the conclusion that the disaster would\r\nbe of short duration, the pleasure was nevertheless real. It was\r\nespecially intense when he thought of College Hill and its inhabitants\r\nin scenes of dark dismay as they wrestled in vain to understand what had\r\nhappened to the world.\r\n\r\nThere were others who fed upon the disaster. For the most part they\r\nfound it an interruption to be met with courage, with faith, with\r\nwhatever strength was inherent in them.\r\n\r\nIt was not a time of growth, however, for Reverend Aylesworth. It was\r\nthe kind of thing for which he had been preparing all his life. Now he\r\nwould test and verify the stature he had already gained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the night they verified the presence of the comet dust in the\r\ndisabled engines, Ken was the last to leave the laboratory. It was near\r\nmidnight when he got away.\r\n\r\nHis father had left much earlier, urging him to come along, but Ken had\r\nbeen unable to pull himself away from the examination and measurement of\r\nthe spectrum of lines that bared the comet's secret. He had begun to\r\nunderstand the pleasure his father had spoken of, the pleasure of being\r\nconsumed utterly by a problem important in its own right.\r\n\r\nAs he left the campus there was no moon in the sky. The comet was gone,\r\nand the stars seemed new in a glory he had not seen for many nights. He\r\nfelt that he wouldn't be able to sleep even when he got home, and he\r\ncontinued walking for several blocks, in the direction of town.\r\n\r\nHe came abreast, finally, of the former Rainbow Skating Rink, which had\r\nbeen converted into a food warehouse. In the darkness, he saw a sudden,\r\nswift movement against the wall of the building. His night vision was\r\nsharp after the long walk; he saw what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe broad doors of the rink had been broken open. There were three or\r\nfour men lifting sacks and boxes and barrels stealthily into a wagon.\r\n\r\nEven as he started toward them he realized his own foolishness and\r\npulled back. A horse whinnied softly. He turned to run in the direction\r\nof Sheriff Johnson's house, and behind him came a sudden, hoarse cry of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nHorses' hoofs rattled frighteningly loud on the cement. Ken realized he\r\nstood no chance of escaping if he were seen. He dodged for an instant\r\ninto a narrow space between two buildings with the thought of reaching\r\nan alley at the back. However, it was boarded at the end and he saw that\r\nhe would have to scale the fence. A desperate horseman would ride him\r\ndown in the narrow space.\r\n\r\nHe fled on and reached the shadows in front of the drugstore. He pressed\r\nhimself as flat as possible in the recess of the doorway, hoping his\r\npursuer would race by. But his fleeing shadow had been seen.\r\n\r\nThe rider whirled and reined the horse to a furious stop. The animal's\r\nfront legs pawed the air in front of Ken's face. Then Ken saw there was\r\nsomething familiar about the figure. He peered closer as the horseman\r\nwhirled again.\r\n\r\n\"Jed,\" he called softly. \"Jed Tucker--\"\r\n\r\nThe figure answered harshly, \"Yeah. Yeah, that's me, and you're--you're\r\nKen. I'm sorry it had to be you. Why did you have to come by here at\r\nthis time of night?\"\r\n\r\nKen heard the sound of running feet in the distance as others came to\r\njoin Jed Tucker. Jed had not dismounted, but held Ken prisoner in the\r\nrecess with the rearing, impatient horse.\r\n\r\nKen wondered how Jed Tucker could be mixed up in a thing like this. His\r\nfather was president of the bank and owned one of the best homes in\r\nMayfield. Jed and Ken had played football on the first team together\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\"Jed,\" Ken said quickly, \"give it up! Don't go through with this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" Jed snarled. He reined the horse nearer, threatening Ken with\r\nthe thrashing front legs.\r\n\r\nWhen Jed's companions arrived, Jed dismounted from the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" a panting voice asked.\r\n\r\nA cold panic shot through Ken. He recognized the voice. It was that of\r\nMr. Tucker himself. The bank official was taking part in the looting of\r\nthe warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe third man, Ken recognized in rising horror, was Mr. Allen, a\r\nnext-door neighbor of the Tuckers. He was the town's foremost attorney,\r\nand one of its most prominent citizens.\r\n\r\n\"We can't let him go,\" Allen was saying. \"Whoever he is, we've got to\r\nget him out of the way.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker came closer. He gasped in dismay. \"It's young Maddox,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You! What are you doing out this time of night?\"\r\n\r\nUnder any other conditions, the question would have seemed humorous,\r\ncoming from whom it did now. But Ken felt no humor; he sensed the\r\ndesperate fury in these men.\r\n\r\n\"Give it up,\" he repeated quietly. \"The lives of fifteen thousand people\r\ndepend on this food supply. You have no right to steal an ounce that\r\ndoesn't belong to you. I'll never tell what I've seen.\"\r\n\r\nTucker shook his head in a dazed, uncomprehending manner, as if the\r\nproposition were too fantastic to be considered. \"We can't do that,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"We can't let him go!\" Allen repeated.\r\n\r\n\"You can't expect us to risk murder!\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be plenty of that before this winter's over!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our lives depend on this food, you know that,\" Tucker said desperately\r\nto Ken. \"You take your share, and we'll all be in this together. Then we\r\nknow we'll be safe.\"\r\n\r\nKen considered, his panic increasing. To refuse might mean his life. If\r\nhe could pretend to fall in with them....\r\n\r\n\"You can't trust him!\" Allen raged. \"No one is going to be in on this\r\nexcept us.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lawyer stepped near, his hand raised high in the air.\r\nBefore Ken sensed his intention, a heavy club smashed against his head.\r\nHis body fell in a crumpled heap on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was after 2 a.m. when Professor Maddox awoke with the sensation that\r\nsomething was vaguely wrong. He sat up in bed and looked out the window\r\nat the starlit sky. He remembered he had left Ken at the university and\r\nhad not yet heard him come in.\r\n\r\nQuietly he arose from the bed and tiptoed along the hallway to Ken's\r\nroom. He used the beam of a precious flashlight for a moment to scan the\r\nundisturbed bed. Panic started inside him and was fought down.\r\n\r\nProbably Ken had found something interesting to keep him from noticing\r\nthe alarm clock on a shelf in the laboratory. Perhaps someone had even\r\nforgotten to wind the clock and it had run down.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, even, the bearings of its balance wheel had finally become\r\nfrozen and had brought it to a stop!\r\n\r\nMrs. Maddox was behind him as he turned from the door. \"What's wrong?\"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\nHe flashed the light on the bed again. \"I'd better go up to the\r\nlaboratory and have a look,\" he said.\r\n\r\nKen's mother nodded. She sensed her husband's worry, and wanted not to\r\nadd to it. \"Take Ken's bicycle,\" she said. \"It will be quicker, even if\r\nyou have to walk it uphill. I'll have some hot chocolate for you when\r\nyou come back.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox dressed hurriedly and took the bicycle from the garage.\r\nHe did have to wheel it most of the way up the hill, but it would be\r\neasier coming down anyway, he thought. He wondered how much longer the\r\nbearings in it would hold up without freezing.\r\n\r\nAs he came within view of the laboratory building he saw that the\r\nwindows were utterly dark. He knew that even with the shades down he\r\nwould have been able to see some glow of the oil lamps which they used,\r\nprovided Ken were still there.\r\n\r\nHe waited a full 10 minutes against the chance that Ken had put out the\r\nlamps and was on his way out. Then he knew Ken had gone long ago. He\r\nought to call the Sheriff and have the police cars search for him, but\r\nthere were no phones and no cars.\r\n\r\nHe mounted the bicycle in fresh panic and rode recklessly down the hill\r\nto town. At Sheriff Johnson's house he pounded frantically on the door\r\nuntil the Sheriff shouted angrily through an open window, \"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Dr. Maddox. You've got to help me, Johnson. Ken's disappeared.\" He\r\nwent into details, and the Sheriff grunted, holding back his irritation\r\nat being disturbed, because of his long friendship with Henry Maddox.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I should have gone down to the station,\" said Professor Maddox,\r\nrealizing what he had done. \"I had forgotten there would be men on\r\nduty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right. I'll come with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff's car had broken down days before. He kept a horse for his\r\nown official use. \"You can ride behind me,\" he said. \"Sally's a pretty\r\ndecent gal. You get up there on the porch railing and climb on right\r\nbehind me.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox maneuvered himself behind the Sheriff on the horse,\r\nbalancing unsteadily as Sally shied away. \"Where do you think Ken could\r\nhave gone?\" asked Johnson. \"Don't you suppose he's over at one of his\r\nfriend's?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't do a thing like that without letting us know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He went up the canyon with the wood detail 2 or 3 weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know--but that was different. Aren't there any policemen on the\r\nstreets now? What happened to the ones who used to patrol in the radio\r\ncars?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're walking their beats, most of them. Two are mounted in each\r\ndistrict. We'll stop by the station, and then try to find the mounted\r\nofficers. It's the only thing we can do.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved down the dark, empty streets. It seemed as if there never had\r\nbeen any life flowing along them, and never would be again. They passed\r\nthe station, lit by a smoking oil lamp, and left word of Ken's\r\ndisappearance, and moved on. They came to the edge of the business\r\nsection, where street lamps used to shine. This area was even more\r\nghostly than the rest, but policemen patrolled it, perhaps out of habit\r\nand a conviction that failure to do so would admit the end of all that\r\nwas familiar and right.\r\n\r\nAs they rode on, the clatter of other hoofbeats on the cement sounded\r\nbehind them. Johnson turned and halted. A flashlight shone in their\r\nfaces. It was Officer Dan Morris, who identified himself by turning the\r\nlight on his own face.\r\n\r\n\"The warehouse has been broken into,\" he said. \"Over at the skating\r\nrink. Somebody has busted in and made off with a lot of food.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff seemed stunned by the news. \"What idiots!\" he muttered\r\nself-accusingly. \"What complete, pinheaded idiots we turned out to be.\r\nWe didn't even think to put a special guard around the warehouse! Do any\r\nof the other patrolmen know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Clark and Dudly are over there now. I was trying to round up\r\nsomeone else while they look for clues.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to get over there,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"But Ken ...\" Professor Maddox said. \"I've got to keep looking.\"\r\n\r\n\"You come with us. I've got to look into the robbery. Ken can't have\r\ncome to any harm. I'll pass the word along and we'll all keep watch for\r\nhim. I promise you we will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep on,\" said Professor Maddox. He slid from the horse. \"I'll\r\nkeep moving along the street here. If you find anything, I'll be\r\nsomewhere between here and home.\"\r\n\r\nUnwillingly, Sheriff Johnson turned and left him. The sounds of the two\r\nhorses echoed loudly in the deserted street. Professor Maddox felt a\r\nburst of anger at their abandonment of him, but he supposed the Sheriff\r\nwas doing what he had to do.\r\n\r\nHe recognized that it was foolhardy to be afoot in the deserted town\r\nthis time of night. Without a single clue to Ken's whereabouts, what\r\ncould he hope to accomplish? He strode on along the sidewalk in the\r\ndirection the policeman had disappeared. It was as good a direction as\r\nany.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone a block he stumbled in the darkness. Some soft,\r\nresilient object lay across the sidewalk before Billings Drugstore. In\r\nanger at the obstacle, Professor Maddox caught himself and moved on. A\r\nsound stopped him. A groan of agony came from the object upon which he\r\nhad stumbled. He turned and bent down and knew it was a human being.\r\nFaintly, under the starlight, he glimpsed the dark pool of blood on the\r\nsidewalk. He turned the body gently until he could see the face. It was\r\nKen.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know how long he knelt there inspecting the motionless\r\nfeatures of his son. He was aware only of running frantically in the\r\ndirection of the warehouse. He found Johnson. He clutched the Sheriff's\r\narm. \"They've killed him!\" he cried. \"I found Ken and they've killed\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nJohnson turned to the nearest officer. \"Ride for Dr. Adams. Dudly, get\r\nthat horse and wagon that's at Whitaker's place. Where did you say you\r\nfound Ken, Professor?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Billings. Lying on the sidewalk with his head smashed in.\"\r\n\r\n\"You others meet us there,\" he called.\r\n\r\nClumsily, they mounted the Sheriff's horse together again. It seemed to\r\ntake hours to ride the short distance.\r\n\r\nThey dismounted and Johnson knelt and touched the boy tenderly.\r\n\r\nThen Professor Maddox heard, barely audible, the sound he would remember\r\nall his life as the most wonderful sound in the world.\r\n\r\n\"Dad....\" Ken's lips moved with the word. \"Dad....\" His voice was a plea\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9. _Judgment_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was snow. It covered the whole world beyond the hospital window.\r\nIts depth was frightening, and the walls seemed no barrier. It was as\r\nmuch inside as out, filling the room to the ceiling with a fluffy white\r\nthat swirled and pulsed in waves before his eyes.\r\n\r\nMuch later, when the pain softened and his vision cleared, he saw the\r\nonly real snow was that piled outside almost to the level of the\r\nfirst-story windows. Within the room, the outline of familiar objects\r\nshowed clearly.\r\n\r\nIn half-recovered consciousness he wondered impersonally about the dying\r\npain in his head and how he came to be where he was. He could remember\r\nonly about a strange thing in the sky, and a great fear.\r\n\r\nThen it burst upon him in full recollection--the comet, the dust, the\r\nlaboratory. They had proved the dust that was in the comet's tail had\r\naccumulated in the metal surfaces of the failed engines. What more did\r\nthey need to prove the comet's responsibility?\r\n\r\nHe slept, and when he awoke his father was there. \"Hi, Son,\" Professor\r\nMaddox said.\r\n\r\nKen smiled weakly. \"Hi, Dad.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Adams wouldn't let them talk much, and he didn't want Ken's father\r\nto tell him why he was there. He wanted Ken to dredge out of his own\r\nmemories the circumstances of the attack.\r\n\r\nKen said, \"I've got to get out of here. Things must be getting behind at\r\nthe lab. Have you found anything new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy,\" his father said. \"We've got a little better picture of\r\nwhat we're up against. The dust is quite definitely from the comet's\r\ntail. It has a very large molecule, and is suspended in our atmosphere\r\nin colloidal form. Its basis is a transuranic element, which is,\r\nhowever, only slightly radioactive. By volume, it is present in the\r\namount of about one part in ten million, which is fairly heavy\r\nconcentration for an alien substance of that kind.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most important thing we've found is that it has a strong\r\naffinity for metals, so that its accumulation on metallic surfaces is\r\nmuch higher than in the general atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would!\" Ken said, with a vague attempt at humor. \"Why couldn't it\r\nhave had an affinity for old rubber tires, or secondhand galoshes?\r\n\r\n\"How late is it? Can I get up to the lab this afternoon?\" Ken struggled\r\nto a sitting position. A gigantic pain shot through his head and down\r\nhis spinal column. He felt as if his head were encased in a cement\r\nblock. He fell back with a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Don't try that again for a few days!\" his father said severely. \"You're\r\nnot going anywhere for quite a while. I have to go now, but your mother\r\nwill be in tonight. Maria will come, too. You do what the doctors and\r\nnurses tell you to!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad--why am I here?\" He moaned in agony of both spirit and body.\r\n\r\n\"You had an accident,\" said Dr. Adams smoothly. \"It will all come back\r\nto you and you'll soon be fine.\"\r\n\r\nKen watched his father disappear through the doorway. He felt the sting\r\nof a needle in his arm and was aware the nurse was standing near. He\r\nwanted to talk some more, but suddenly he was too tired to do anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt came to him in the middle of the night, like a dark, wild dream that\r\ncould be only the utmost fantasy. He remembered the silent, shapeless\r\nfigures against the black wall of the old skating rink, and then he knew\r\nit wasn't a dream because he could remember clearly the words of Jed\r\nTucker and his father. He could also remember Mr. Allen saying, \"We\r\ncan't let him go. Whoever he is, we've got to get him out of the way.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered the instant of crashing pain. Mr. Allen had struck with\r\nthe intent to kill him. Again, he wondered for a moment if it were not\r\njust a nightmare. Mr. Allen, the town's leading attorney, and Mr.\r\nTucker, the banker--what would they be doing, plotting robbery and\r\nkilling?\r\n\r\nIn the morning he told his father about it. Professor Maddox could not\r\nbelieve it, either. \"You must be mistaken, Ken,\" he protested. \"These\r\nmen are two of our leading citizens. They're both on the Mayor's food\r\ncommittee. You suffered a pretty terrible shock, and you'll have to\r\nrealize the effects of it may be with you, and may upset your thinking,\r\nfor quite a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not about this! I know who it was. I recognized their voices in the\r\ndark. Jed Tucker admitted his identity when I called his name. If\r\nthere's anything gone from the warehouse, Sheriff Johnson will find it\r\nin their possession.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff had to wait for permission from Dr. Adams, but he came\r\naround that afternoon, and was equally unbelieving. He advanced the same\r\narguments Professor Maddox had used about the character of those Ken\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n\"These men will do something far worse, if you don't stop them,\" said\r\nKen.\r\n\r\n\"He's right, there,\" said Professor Maddox. \"Those who did this, menace\r\nthe whole community. They've got to be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll make fools of ourselves,\" said the Sheriff, \"if we go to Tucker's\r\nand Allen's, and demand to search the premises. We've got to have more\r\nthan your word, Ken; some evidence of their positive connection with the\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just know I saw and heard them. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" the Sheriff said suddenly, \"there's one man in this town\r\nthat's really out to get you: Frank Meggs. Don't you think it could be\r\nMeggs and some of his friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It wasn't Frank Meggs.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArt Matthews came around later that same day. \"You look worse than one\r\nof these engines that's got itself full of stardust,\" he said. \"You must\r\nhave been off your rocker, prowling around back alleys in the middle of\r\nthe night!\"\r\n\r\nKen grinned. \"Hi, Art. I knew you'd be full of sympathy. What's going on\r\noutside while I've been laid up? Say--I don't even know how long I've\r\nbeen here! What day is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday. Not that it makes any difference any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday--and it was Saturday when I was working with the spectroscope.\r\nI've been here three days!\"\r\n\r\n\"A week and three days,\" said Art Matthews. \"You were out cold for three\r\ndays straight, and they wondered if your bearings were ever going to\r\nturn again.\"\r\n\r\nKen lay back in astonishment. \"Nobody's told me anything. What's\r\nhappening outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a rough winter,\" Art Matthews said, grimly. \"Snow's\r\nstarted heavy, two weeks earlier than usual. I understand Professor\r\nDouglas thinks it's got something to do with the comet dust in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"That figures. What about the fuel supply?\"\r\n\r\n\"In pretty sad shape, too. So far, the stockpile is big enough for about\r\na week and a half of real cold. They laid off woodcutting for three days\r\nto spend all the time converting oil burners, and making new heaters out\r\nof 50-gallon barrels and anything else they could find. It's going to be\r\na mighty cold winter--and a hungry one.\"\r\n\r\nKen nodded, but he seemed to be thinking of something else.\r\n\r\n\"I've had an idea,\" he said. \"How's your stock of spare parts in the\r\ngarage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I always was a fool about stocking up on things I could never\r\nsell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any blocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a dozen, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you make a brand-new engine out of spare parts?\"\r\n\r\nThe mechanic considered, then nodded. \"I think I could put together a\r\nFord or Chevy engine. What good would that do? It would run down in a\r\nfew days, just like all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it would, if you put it in a sealed room, and supplied\r\nonly filtered air to it?\"\r\n\r\nArt's eyes lighted. \"Why the dickens didn't we think of that before? If\r\nwe could keep the stardust from getting to the engine, there's no reason\r\nat all why it shouldn't run as long as we wanted it to, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"If a generator could be assembled in the same way, we could stir up a\r\nlittle power on an experimental basis, enough to charge our radio\r\nbatteries. I wonder how much power could be generated in the whole\r\ncountry by such means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know we could get a couple of dozen engines going here in Mayfield,\r\nat least!\" said Art.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you get started right away? Get some of the club guys to\r\nhelp. If that filter idea works there may be a lot of things we can do.\"\r\n\r\nArt started for the door. \"Sheer genius,\" he said admiringly. \"That's\r\nsheer genius, Boy!\"\r\n\r\nKen smiled to himself. He wondered why they hadn't tried that when they\r\nfirst had the hunch that comet dust could be responsible. Maybe they\r\ncould have saved some of the cars if they had rigged more efficient\r\nfilters on the air intakes.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts went back to the attack. He was still thinking about it\r\nwhen his father and Sheriff Johnson returned.\r\n\r\n\"We took your word, Son,\" the Sheriff said, chagrined. \"We got a warrant\r\nand searched the Tucker and Allen premises from top to bottom. We went\r\nout to Tucker's farm and went through the barns and the house. They've\r\ngot a 2-day supply of rations just like everybody else.\r\n\r\n\"They screamed their heads off and threatened suit for slander and false\r\narrest and everything else in the books.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get hold of Jed Tucker when I get out of here,\" said Ken. \"He'll\r\ntalk when I get through with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get yourself in a worse jam than you've stirred up already.\r\nUnless you can prove what you say, you'll just have to forget it and\r\nkeep quiet.\"\r\n\r\nKen smiled suddenly. \"It just occurred to me--when a banker wants to\r\nkeep something safe, where does he put it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the bank, of course,\" said the Sheriff. \"Wait a minute, you don't\r\nthink....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? The bank isn't doing business any more. Tucker is the only\r\none, probably, who has any excuse to go down there. As long as things\r\nare the way they are, nobody else is going to get inside the vault--or\r\neven inside the building.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox and the Sheriff looked at each other. \"It's a logical\r\nidea,\" said Ken's father.\r\n\r\n\"It's as crazy as the rest of it! We've made fools of ourselves already\r\nso we might as well finish the job!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was served the next morning, Ken found out his hunch had\r\nbeen right. He heard it from Miss Haskins the nurse and knew, therefore,\r\nthat it must be all over town.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was wide-eyed. \"What do you think?\" she said, as she set out\r\nthe bowl of oatmeal. \"The Sheriff found that Mr. Tucker had filled his\r\nbank vault with food. He'd stolen it from the warehouse. The Sheriff's\r\nmen obtained a warrant and forced Tucker to open the vault, and there\r\nwere cases of canned goods stacked clear to the ceiling!\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have been afraid of getting hungry,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"To think a man like Mr. Tucker would do something like that!\" She went\r\nout, clucking her tongue in exaggerated dismay.\r\n\r\nKen leaned back with satisfaction. He quite agreed with Miss Haskins. It\r\nwas a pretty awful thing for a man like Mr. Tucker to have done.\r\n\r\nHow many others would do far worse before the winter was over?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sun came out bright and clear after the series of heavy snowstorms.\r\nThe comet added its overwhelming, golden light and tinted the world of\r\nsnow. Some of the snow was melted by the tantalizing warmth, but water\r\nthat had melted in the daytime froze immediately at night, and the\r\nunequal contest between the elements could have only one outcome in a\r\nprematurely cold and miserable winter.\r\n\r\nAs the pain in his head dwindled, and he was able to get about in the\r\nhospital, Ken grew more and more impatient to be released. He wondered\r\nabout the heating and other facilities in the hospital and learned the\r\nMayor's committee had ordered one wing kept open at all times, with heat\r\nand food available to care for any emergency cases.\r\n\r\nThree days after he was allowed on his feet, Ken was told by Dr. Adams\r\nthat he could be released for the hearing of the Tuckers and Mr. Allen.\r\n\r\nKen stared at him. \"I don't want to go to any hearing! I'm going back to\r\nthe laboratory!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can go home,\" said Dr. Adams. \"I want you to rest a few more days,\r\nand then I would prefer seeing you get out in the open, working with\r\nthe wood crew, instead of going right back to the lab.\r\n\r\n\"As for the trial and hearing, I'm afraid you have no choice. Judge\r\nRankin has postponed the hearing so that you could appear, and he'll\r\nissue a subpoena if necessary to insure your presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"They caught Tucker redhanded with his bank vault stuffed to the ceiling\r\nwith stolen goods. They don't need me!\"\r\n\r\n\"They tried to kill you,\" Dr. Adams reminded him. \"That's quite\r\ndifferent from robbing a warehouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not interested in their punishment. It's more important to work on\r\nthe analysis of the comet dust.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no way out of it. Judge Rankin ordered Ken to appear. In\r\nspite of the fact that the building was unheated, and mushy snow was\r\nfalling from a heavy sky once more, the courtroom was jammed on the day\r\nof the hearing.\r\n\r\nKen raged inwardly at the enormous waste of human resources. Men who\r\nshould have been in the hills gathering wood, women who should have been\r\nat work on clothing and food projects were there to feed on the\r\ncarcasses of the reputations presently to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nKen had little difficulty feeling sorry for Jed. His former teammate had\r\nbeen a good sport in all Ken's experience of playing with him. He could\r\nalmost feel pity for Jed's father, too. On the stand, the banker looked\r\nsteadfastly at the floor as he answered questions in a dull, monotone\r\nvoice. He admitted the theft of the warehouse goods.\r\n\r\nJudge Rankin asked severely, \"Why, Mr. Tucker? Why did you think you had\r\nany more right to hoard supplies than the rest of us?\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time the banker looked up, and he met the judge's eyes.\r\n\"We were scared,\" he said simply. \"We were scared of what is going to\r\nhappen this winter.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge's eyes flashed. \"So you were scared?\" he cried. \"Don't you\r\nthink we're all scared?\"\r\n\r\nThe banker shook his head and looked at the floor. \"I don't know,\" he\r\nsaid, as if in a daze. \"We were just scared.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer, Allen, was more belligerent when he took the stand. \"We\r\nmerely did what anyone else in this courtroom would do if he had the\r\nchance, and thought of it first,\" he said. \"Do with me what you like,\r\nbut before this winter is over, I'll see you self-righteous citizens of\r\nMayfield at each other's throats for a scrap of food.\"\r\n\r\nHe admitted the attack on Ken, but denied the intent to kill.\r\n\r\nWhen Ken's turn came, he told his story as simply and as quickly as\r\npossible, and when he had finished he said, \"I'd like to add one more\r\nword, if I may.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge nodded. \"Go ahead, Ken.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked over the faces of the audience. \"We've got troubles enough,\"\r\nhe said slowly. \"As much as we hate to admit it, the picture Mr. Allen\r\ngives us may be right--unless we do what we can to stop it.\r\n\r\n\"We're wasting time and resources today. My father and I should be at\r\nthe laboratory. Every man and woman here is neglecting a job. We waste\r\ntime, deliberating about punishment for some of our neighbors who are\r\nperhaps weaker, but certainly no more frightened than the rest of us. If\r\nwe lock them up in prison somebody has to watch out for them, and the\r\nwhole community is deprived of their useful labor.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't we just let them go?\"\r\n\r\nA gasp of surprise came from the spectators, but a slow illumination\r\nseemed to light the face of Judge Rankin. His eyes moved from Ken to the\r\naccused men and then to the audience.\r\n\r\n\"This court has just heard what it considers some very sound advice,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Jed, Mr. Tucker, Mr. Allen....\"\r\n\r\nThe three stood before him.\r\n\r\n\"I am taking it upon myself, because of the emergency conditions that\r\nconfront us, to declare that the penalty for your crime is continued and\r\nincessant labor at any task the community may see fit to assign you. You\r\nare marked men. Your crime is known to every member of this community.\r\nThere will be no escape from the surveillance of your neighbors and\r\nfriends. I sentence you to so conduct yourselves in the eyes of these\r\npeople that, if we do come through this time of crisis, you may stand\r\nredeemed for all time of the crime which you have committed.\r\n\r\n\"If you fail to do this, the punishment which will be automatically\r\nimposed is banishment from this community for the duration of the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n\"Court stands adjourned!\"\r\n\r\nA burst of cheers broke out in the room. The Tuckers and Mr. Allen\r\nlooked as if they could not believe what they had heard. Then Jed turned\r\nsuddenly and rushed toward Ken.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good saying I've been a fool, but let me say thanks for your\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker took Ken's other hand. \"You'll never regret it, young man.\r\nI'll see to it that you never regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's okay,\" said Ken, almost gruffly. \"We've all got a lot of work to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned as a figure brushed by them. Mr. Allen pushed through the\r\ncrowd to the doorway. He looked at no one.\r\n\r\n\"We were fools,\" said Mr. Tucker bitterly. \"Brainless, scared fools.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, Dr. Aylesworth put his hand on Ken's shoulder.\r\n\"That was a mighty fine thing you did. I hope it sets a pattern for all\r\nof us in times to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do it for them,\" said Ken. \"I did it for myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe minister smiled and clapped the boy's shoulder again. \"Nevertheless,\r\nyou did it. That's what counts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10. _Victory of the Dust_\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time Ken was through with the ordeal in court, Art Matthews had\r\nsucceeded in building an engine from entirely new parts. He had it\r\ninstalled in an airtight room into which only filtered air could pass.\r\n\r\nThis room, and another air filter, had been major projects in\r\nthemselves. The science club members had done most of the work after\r\ntheir daily stint at the laboratory, while Art had scoured the town for\r\nparts that would fit together.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hearing Ken went to the garage. The engine had been\r\nrunning for 5 hours then. Art was grinning like a schoolboy who had just\r\nwon a spelling bee. \"She sure sounds sweet,\" he said. \"I'll bet we can\r\nkeep her going as long as we have gasoline.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" Ken said. \"It's just a waste of power to let it run that\r\nway, though.\"\r\n\r\nArt scratched his head. \"Yeah. It's funny, power is what we've been\r\nwanting, and now we've got a little we don't know what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see if we can find a generator,\" said Ken. \"Charge some batteries\r\nwith it. Do you think there's one in town?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best deal I can think of would be to scrounge a big motor, say an\r\nelevator motor, and convert it. The one belonging to the 5-story\r\nelevator in the Norton Building is our best bet. I don't imagine it\r\nfroze up before the power went out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get it then,\" said Ken. \"Shut this off until we're ready to use\r\nit. To be on the safe side, could you cast some new bearings for the\r\ngenerator?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why not.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned home Ken told his father for the first time about the\r\nproject Art was working on.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds interesting,\" Professor Maddox said. \"I'm not sure exactly\r\nwhat it will prove.\"\r\n\r\nKen slumped in the large chair in the living room, weak after his\r\nexertions of the day. \"It would mean that if we could find enough\r\nunfrozen engines, or could assemble them from spare parts, we could get\r\nsome power equipment in operation again.\r\n\r\n\"However, as Art said about this one engine, what good is it? Dad--even\r\nif we lick this problem, how are things ever going to get started up\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got one automobile engine going. Pretty soon we'll run out of gas\r\nhere in Mayfield. Where do we get more? We can't until the railroad can\r\nhaul it, or the pipelines can pump it. What happens when the stock at\r\nthe refineries is all used up? How can they get into operation again?\r\nThey need power for their own plant, electricity for their pumps and\r\nengines. All of their frozen equipment has to be replaced. Maybe some of\r\nit will have to be manufactured. How do the factories and plants get\r\nstarted again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the answers to all that,\" Ken's father said. \"Licking the\r\ncomet dust _is_ only half the problem--and perhaps the smallest half, at\r\nthat. Our economy and industry will have to start almost from scratch in\r\ngetting underway. How that will come about, if it ever does, I do not\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nTo conserve their ration of firewood, only a small blaze burned in the\r\nfireplace. The kitchen and living room were being heated by it alone.\r\nThe rest of the house was closed off.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to rig up something else,\" Ken said tiredly. \"That wastes too\r\nmuch heat. What's Mom cooking on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mayor Hilliard found a little wood burner and gave it to me. I haven't\r\nhad time to try converting our oil furnace.\"\r\n\r\nKen felt unable to stay awake longer. He went upstairs to bed for a few\r\nhours. Later, his mother brought a dinner tray. \"Do you want it here, or\r\nwould you rather come down where it's warm?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come down. I want to get up for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maria is out in the shack. She has a scheduled contact with Berkeley,\r\nbut she says the transmitter won't function. It looks like a burned-out\r\ntube to her. She wanted to call Joe.\"\r\n\r\nKen scrambled out of bed and grabbed for his clothes. \"I'll take care of\r\nit. Save dinner for me. We've got to keep the station on the air, no\r\nmatter what happens!\"\r\n\r\nHe found Maria seated by the desk, listening to the Berkeley operator's\r\nrepeated call, to which she could not reply. The girl wore a heavy\r\ncardigan sweater, which was scarcely sufficient for the cold in the\r\nroom. The small, tin-can heater was hardly noticeable.\r\n\r\nMaria looked up as Ken burst through the doorway. \"I didn't want you to\r\ncome,\" she said. \"They could have called Joe.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't risk disturbing our schedule. They might think we've gone\r\nunder and we'd lose our contact completely.\"\r\n\r\nHastily he examined the tube layout and breathed a sigh of relief when\r\nhe saw it was merely one of the 801's that had burned a filament. They\r\nhad a good stock of spares. He replaced the tube and closed the\r\ntransmitter cage. After the tubes had warmed up, and the Berkeley\r\noperator paused to listen for their call, Ken picked up the microphone\r\nand threw in the antenna switch.\r\n\r\n\"Mayfield calling Berkeley.\" He repeated this several times. \"Our\r\ntransmitter's been out with a bum bottle. Let us know if you read us\r\nnow.\" He repeated again and switched back to the receiver.\r\n\r\nThe Berkeley operator's voice indicated his relief. \"I read you,\r\nMayfield. I hoped you hadn't gone out of commission. The eggheads here\r\nseem to think your Maddox-Larsen combination is coming up with more dope\r\non comet dust than anybody else in the country.\"\r\n\r\nKen grinned and patted himself and Maria on the back. \"That's us,\" he\r\nsaid. She grimaced at him.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a big report here from Dr. French. Confirm if you're ready to\r\ntape it, and I'll let it roll.\"\r\n\r\nMaria cut in to confirm that they were receiving and ready to record.\r\nThe Berkeley operator chuckled as he came back. \"That's the one I like\r\nto hear,\" he said. \"That 'Scandahoovian' accent is real cute. Just as\r\nsoon as things get rolling again I'm coming out there to see what else\r\ngoes with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's an idiot,\" Maria said.\r\n\r\n\"But probably a pretty nice guy,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\nThey listened carefully as the Berkeley operator read a number of pages\r\nof reports by Dr. French and his associates, concerning experiments run\r\nin the university laboratories. These gave Ken a picture of the present\r\nstage of the work on the comet dust. He felt disheartened. Although the\r\nmaterial had been identified as a colloidal compound of a new,\r\ntransuranic metal, no one had yet been able to determine its exact\r\nchemical structure nor involve it in any reaction that would break it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Ken that one of the biggest drawbacks was lack of\r\nsufficient sample material to work with. Everything they were doing was\r\nby micromethods. He supposed it was his own lack of experience and his\r\nclumsiness in the techniques that made him feel he was always working in\r\nthe dark when trying to analyze chemical specimens that were barely\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWhen the contact was completed and the stations signed off, Maria told\r\nKen what she had heard over the air during the time he was in the\r\nhospital. Several other amateur operators in various parts of the\r\ncountry had heard them with their own battery-powered sets. They had\r\nasked to join in an expanded news net.\r\n\r\nJoe and Al had agreed to this, and Ken approved as he heard of it. \"It's\r\na good idea. I was hoping to reach some other areas. Maybe we can add\r\nsome industrial laboratories to our net if any are still operating.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got three,\" said Maria. \"General Electric in Schenectady, General\r\nMotors in Detroit, and Hughes in California. Amateurs working for these\r\ncompanies called in. They're all working on the dust.\"\r\n\r\nThrough these new amateur contacts Maria had learned that Chicago had\r\nbeen completely leveled by fire. Thousands had died in the fire and in\r\nthe rioting that preceded it.\r\n\r\nNew York City had suffered almost as much, although no general fire had\r\nbroken out. Mob riots over the existing, scanty food supplies had taken\r\nthousands of lives. Other thousands had been lost in a panicky exodus\r\nfrom the city. The highways leading into the farming areas in upstate\r\nNew York and New England areas were clogged with starving refugees.\r\nThousands of huddled bodies lay under the snow.\r\n\r\nWestward into Pennsylvania and south into Delaware it was the same. Here\r\nthe refugees were met with other streams of desperate humanity moving\r\nout of the thickly populated cities. Epidemics of disease had broken\r\nout where the starving population was thickest and the sanitary\r\nfacilities poorest.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast the situation was somewhat better. The population of\r\nthe Bay Area was streaming north and south toward Red Bluff and\r\nSacramento, and into the Salinas and San Joaquin valleys. From southern\r\nCalifornia they were moving east to the reclaimed desert farming areas.\r\nThere were suffering and death among them, but the rioting and mob\r\nviolence were less.\r\n\r\nFrom all over the country there were increasing reports of groups of\r\nwanderers moving like nomadic tribesmen, looting, killing, and\r\ndestroying. There was no longer any evidence of a central government\r\ncapable of sufficient communication to control these elements of the\r\npopulation on even a local basis.\r\n\r\nMaria played the tapes of these reports for Ken. She seemed stolid and\r\nbeyond panic as she heard them again. To Ken, hearing them for the first\r\ntime, it seemed utterly beyond belief. It was simply some\r\nscience-fiction horror story played on the radio or television, and when\r\nit was over he would find the world was completely normal.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and saw Maria watching him. He saw the little tin-can stove\r\nwith a few sticks of green wood burning ineffectively. He saw the large\r\nrack of batteries behind the transmitter. Unexpectedly, for the first\r\ntime in many days, he thought of the Italian steamship alone in the\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"The _White Bird_,\" he said to Maria. \"Did you hear anything more of\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the amateurs told me he'd picked up a report from the ship about\r\na week ago. The radio operator said he was barricaded in the radio room.\r\nRioting had broken out all over the ship. Dozens of passengers had been\r\nkilled; the ones who were left were turning cannibalistic. That was the\r\nlast report anyone has heard from the ship.\"\r\n\r\nKen shuddered. He glanced through the window and caught a vision of\r\nScience Hall on College Hill. A fortress, he thought. There were maybe a\r\ndozen other such fortresses scattered throughout the world; in them lay\r\nthe only hope against the enemy that rampaged across the Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the sky, he could see the comet's light faintly, even through the\r\nlead-gray clouds from which snow was falling.\r\n\r\n\"You should get back to bed,\" said Maria. \"You look as if you had been\r\nhit two hours ago instead of two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I'd better.\" Ken arose, feeling weak and dizzy. \"Can you\r\nget that report typed for Dad tonight? It would be good for him to be\r\nable to take it to the lab with him in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it done,\" said Maria. \"You get off to bed.\"\r\n\r\nAs much as he rebelled against it, Ken was forced to spend the next two\r\ndays in bed. Dr. Adams allowed him to be up no more than a few hours on\r\nthe third day. \"I'm afraid you took a worse beating than any of us\r\nthought,\" the doctor said. \"You'll just have to coast for a while.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as he was finally getting out of bed again that he heard Art\r\nMatthews, when the mechanic came to the door and spoke with Ken's\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"This is awfully important,\" Art said. \"I wish you'd ask him if he\r\ndoesn't feel like seeing me for just a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's had a bad relapse, and the doctor says he has to be kept very\r\nquiet for a day or two longer.\"\r\n\r\nDressed, except for his shoes, Ken went to the hall and leaned over the\r\nstair railing. \"I'll be down in just a minute, Art. It's okay, Mom. I'm\r\nfeeling good today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ken! You shouldn't!\" his mother protested.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had his shoes on and was racing down the stairs. \"What's\r\nhappened, Art? Anything gone wrong?\"\r\n\r\nThe mechanic looked downcast. \"Everything! We got the Norton elevator\r\nmotor and hooked it up with the gas engine. It ran fine for a couple of\r\ndays, and we got a lot of batteries charged up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it quit,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--how did you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been afraid we had missed one bet. It just isn't enough to supply\r\nfiltered air to the engines built of new parts. The parts themselves are\r\nalready contaminated with the dust. As soon as they go into operation,\r\nwe have the same old business, all over again.\r\n\r\n\"Unless some means of decontamination can be found these new parts are\r\nno better than the old ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of these parts were wrapped in tissue paper and sealed in\r\ncardboard boxes!\" Art protested. \"How could enough dust get to them to\r\nruin them?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dust has a way of getting into almost any corner it wants to,\" said\r\nKen. \"Dad and the others have found it has a tremendous affinity for\r\nmetals, so it seeps through cracks and sticks. It never moves off once\r\nit hits a piece of metal. What parts of the engine froze?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pistons, bearings--just like all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The generator shaft, too?\"\r\n\r\nArt nodded. \"It might have gone a few more revolutions. It seemed loose\r\nwhen we started work, but as soon as we broke the bearings apart they\r\nseemed to fasten onto the shaft like they were alive. How do you account\r\nfor that? The bearings were new; I just cast them yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were contaminated by dust between casting and installation in the\r\nprotected room. We've got to dig a lot deeper before we've got the right\r\nanswer. It might be worthwhile setting up another rig just like the one\r\nwe have in order to get some more juice in our batteries. Do you think\r\nyou could do it again, or even several times? That engine lasted about\r\n90 hours, didn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighty-eight, altogether. I suppose I could do it again if you think\r\nit's worth it. The trouble is getting generators. Maybe we could machine\r\nthe shaft of this one and cast a new set of bearings to fit. I'll try if\r\nyou think it's worth it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get it ready to run,\" said Ken. \"The battery power for our radio isn't\r\ngoing to last forever. We'll be in a real jam if we lose touch with the\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11. _The Animals Are Sick_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night, Ken reported to his father the fate of the engine assembled\r\nby Art.\r\n\r\n\"It did seem too good to be true,\" said Professor Maddox. He stretched\r\nwearily in the large chair by the feeble heat of the fireplace. \"It\r\nbears out our observation of the affinity of the dust for metals.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It attaches itself almost like a horde of microscopic magnets. It\r\nliterally burrows into the surface of the metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. Its presence breaks down the surface tension, as we had supposed.\r\nThe substance actually then works its way into the interstices of the\r\nmolecules. As the colloid increases in quantity, its molecules loosen\r\nthe bond between the molecules of the metal, giving them increased\r\nfreedom of motion.\r\n\r\n\"This can be aggravated by frictional contacts, and finally we have the\r\nmolecular interchange that binds the two pieces into one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only metal that would be clean would be that which had been\r\nhermetically sealed since before the appearance of the comet,\" said Ken.\r\n\"Look--wouldn't this affinity of the dust for metal provide a means of\r\npurifying the atmosphere? If we could run the air through large filters\r\nof metal wool, the dust would be removed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm very sure we could do it that way. It would merely require\r\nthat we run the atmosphere of the whole Earth through such a filter. Do\r\nyou have any idea how that could be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would work in the laboratory, but would be wholly impractical on a\r\nworldwide scale,\" Ken admitted. \"How will we ever rid the atmosphere of\r\nthe dust! A colloid will float forever in the air, even after the comet\r\nis gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Professor Maddox said, \"and, as far as we are concerned, the\r\nwhole atmosphere of the Earth is permanently poisoned. Our problem is to\r\nprocess it in some manner to remove that poison.\r\n\r\n\"During the past few days we have come to the conclusion that there are\r\nonly two alternatives: One is to process the whole atmosphere by passing\r\nit through some device, such as the filter you have suggested. The\r\nsecond is to put some substance into the air which will counteract and\r\ndestroy the dust, precipitate it out of the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the first method is impractical what can be used in carrying out\r\nthe second?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've set ourselves the goal of discovering that. We're hoping to\r\nsynthesize the necessary chemical compound to accomplish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have to be a colloid, too, capable of suspension in the\r\natmosphere,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we do find such a substance we still have the problem of\r\ndecontaminating existing metals. We couldn't build a moving piece of\r\nmachinery out of any metal now in existence without first cleaning the\r\ndust out of its surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's part of the problem, too,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKen resumed his duties in the laboratory the following morning. Dr.\r\nAdams had warned him not to walk up College Hill, so he had borrowed the\r\nhorse Dave Whitaker still had on loan from his uncle. He felt\r\nself-conscious about being the only one enjoying such luxury, but he\r\npromised himself he would go back to walking as soon as Dr. Adams gave\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, the horse slipped and fell as it picked its way\r\ncarefully down the hill. Ken was thrown clear, into the deep snow, but\r\nthe horse lay where it had fallen, as if unable to move. Ken feared the\r\nanimal had broken a leg. He felt cautiously but could find no evidence\r\nof injury.\r\n\r\nGently, he tugged at the reins and urged the horse to its feet. The\r\nanimal finally rose, but it stood uncertainly and trembled when it tried\r\nto walk again.\r\n\r\nKen walked rather than rode the rest of the way home. He took the horse\r\nto the improvised stable beside the science shack. There he got out the\r\nration of hay and water, and put a small amount of oats in the trough.\r\nThe animal ignored the food and drink.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Ken went out again to check. The horse was lying down in\r\nthe stall and the food remained untouched.\r\n\r\nKen returned to the house and said to his father, \"Dave's horse slipped\r\ntoday, and I'm afraid something serious is wrong with him. He doesn't\r\nseem to have any broken bones, but he won't eat or get up. I think I\r\nshould go for the vet.\"\r\n\r\nHis father agreed. \"We can't afford to risk a single horse, considering\r\nhow precious they are now. You stay in the house and I'll go to Dr.\r\nSmithers' place myself.\"\r\n\r\nKen protested. He hated to see his father go out again on such a cold\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nDr. Smithers grumbled when Professor Maddox reached his house and\r\nexplained what he wanted. As one of the town's two veterinarians, he had\r\nbeen heavily overworked since the disaster struck. The slightest sign\r\nof injury or illness in an animal caused the Mayor's livestock committee\r\nto call for help.\r\n\r\n\"Probably nothing but a strained ligament,\" Smithers said. \"You could\r\nhave taken care of it by wrapping it yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"We think you ought to come.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the veterinarian finally reached the side of the animal, he\r\ninspected him carefully by the light of a gasoline lantern. The horse\r\nwas lying on his side in a bed of hay; he was breathing heavily and his\r\neyes were bright and glassy.\r\n\r\nDr. Smithers sucked his breath in sharply and bent closer. Finally, he\r\ngot to his feet and stared out over the expanse of snow. \"It couldn't\r\nbe,\" he muttered. \"We just don't deserve that. We don't deserve it at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Ken asked anxiously. \"Is it something very serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know for sure. It looks like--it could be anthrax. I'm just\r\nafraid that it is.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Smithers' eyes met and held Professor Maddox's. Ken did not\r\nunderstand. \"I've heard that name, but I don't know what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the most deadly diseases of warm-blooded animals. Spreads like\r\nwildfire when it gets a start. It can infect human beings, too. How\r\ncould it happen here? There hasn't been a case of anthrax in the valley\r\nfor years!\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember Dave Whitaker saying his uncle got two new horses from a\r\nfarmer near Britton just a week before the comet,\" said Ken. \"Maybe it\r\ncould have come from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Smithers.\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\" asked Professor Maddox. \"Can't we start a program of\r\nvaccination to keep it from spreading?\"\r\n\r\n\"How much anthrax vaccine do you suppose there is in the whole town?\r\nBefore we decide anything I want to get Hart and make some tests. If he\r\nagrees with me we've got to get hold of the Mayor and the Council and\r\ndecide on a course of action tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHart was the other veterinarian, a younger man, inclined to look askance\r\nat Dr. Smithers' older techniques.\r\n\r\n\"I'd just as soon take your word,\" said Professor Maddox. \"If you think\r\nwe ought to take action, let's do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want Hart here first,\" said Smithers. \"He's a know-it-all, but he's\r\ngot a good head and good training in spite of it. Someday he'll be a\r\ngood man, and you'll need one after I'm gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go,\" said Ken. \"You've already been out, Dad. It's only 4 or 5\r\nblocks, and I feel fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you feel strong enough,\" said his father hesitantly. Fatigue\r\nwas obvious in his face.\r\n\r\nDr. Hart was asleep when Ken pounded on his door. He persisted until the\r\nveterinarian came, sleepily and rebelliously. Ken told his story\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nHart grunted in a surly voice. \"Anthrax! That fool Smithers probably\r\nwouldn't know a case of anthrax if it stared him in the face. Tell him\r\nto give your horse a shot of terramycin, and I'll come around in the\r\nmorning. If I went out on every scare, I'd never get any sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hart,\" Ken said quietly. \"You know what it means if it is anthrax.\"\r\n\r\nThe veterinarian blinked under Ken's accusing stare. \"All right,\" he\r\nsaid finally. \"But if Smithers is getting me out on a wild-goose chase\r\nI'll run him out of town!\"\r\n\r\nSmithers and Professor Maddox were still beside the ailing horse when\r\nKen returned with Dr. Hart. No one spoke a word as they came up. Hart\r\nwent to work on his examination, Ken holding the lantern for him.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a carbuncle, right back of the ear!\" he said accusingly. \"Didn't\r\nanybody notice this earlier?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Ken admitted. \"I guess I haven't taken very good care\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ken's been in the hospital,\" Professor Maddox said.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Hart answered irritably, \"but I think anybody would have\r\nnoticed this carbuncle; these infections are characteristic. There's not\r\nmuch question about what it is, but we ought to get a smear and make a\r\nmicroscope slide check of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a 1500-power instrument,\" said Ken. \"If that's good enough you\r\ncan use it.\"\r\n\r\nHart nodded. \"Get some sterile slides.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfterward, Smithers said, \"We've got to get Jack Nelson first and find\r\nout how much anthrax vaccine he's got in his store. Nobody else in town\r\nwill have any, except maybe some of his customers who may have bought\r\nsome lately. What about the college laboratories? Do they have any?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Professor Maddox. \"We'll have to contact Dr. Bintz\r\nfor that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get at it,\" said Hart. \"We've got to wake up the Mayor and the\r\nCouncil. The cattle committee will have to be there. Nelson and Bintz,\r\ntoo. We'll find out how much vaccine we've got and decide what to do\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the men met in the Council chambers of City Hall.\r\nBecause of the lack of heat, they retained their overcoats and sheepskin\r\njackets. The incrusted snow on their boots did not even soften. In\r\nsoberness and shock they listened to Dr. Smithers.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody grows up in a farming community without knowing what anthrax\r\nmeans,\" he said. \"We've got a total of twenty-eight hundred head of beef\r\nand dairy cattle in the valley, plus a couple of thousand sheep, and\r\nabout a hundred horses.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Nelson's stock of vaccine, plus what he thinks may be in the hands\r\nof his customers, plus some at the college is enough to treat about a\r\nthousand animals altogether. Those that aren't treated will have to be\r\nslaughtered. If they prove to be uninfected they can be processed for\r\nmeat storage.\r\n\r\n\"Some vaccine will have to be held in reserve, but if we don't clean up\r\nthe valley before next year's calf crop we won't stand a chance of\r\nincreasing our herds. That's the situation we're up against, Gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard arose. \"The only question seems to me to be which animals\r\nare of most worth to us. I say we should let all the sheep go. A cow or\r\na horse is worth more than a sheep to us now.\r\n\r\n\"That leaves the question of the horses. Which is worth more to us: a\r\nhorse or a cow? We can't haul logs without horses, but we won't need to\r\nworry about staying warm if we haven't got food enough.\"\r\n\r\nHarry Mason of the fuel committee stood up immediately. \"I say we've got\r\nto keep every horse we've got. It would be crazy to give any of them up.\r\nThere aren't enough now to haul the fuel we need.\"\r\n\r\n\"A horse is a poor trade for a cow in these times,\" protested the food\r\ncommittee's chief, Paul Remington. \"Every cow you let go means milk for\r\ntwo or three families. It means a calf for next year's meat supply. We\r\ncan freeze and still stay alive. We can't starve and do the same thing.\r\nI say, let every horse in the valley go. Keep the cows and beef cattle.\"\r\n\r\nAn instant hubbub arose, loudly protesting or approving these two\r\nextreme views. Mayor Hilliard pounded on the desk for order. \"We've got\r\nto look at both sides of the question,\" he said, when the confusion had\r\ndied down. \"I know there are some horses we can lose without much\r\nregret; they don't haul as much as they eat. What Paul says, however, is\r\ntrue: Every horse we keep means trading it for a cow and the food a cow\r\ncan provide.\r\n\r\n\"I think we need to keep some horses, but it ought to be the bare\r\nminimum. I've got an idea about this log hauling. Right now, and for a\r\nlong time to come, we don't need horses once the logs are on the road.\r\nIt's a downgrade all the way to town. When the road freezes hard we can\r\ncoast a sled all the way if we rig a way to steer and brake it properly.\r\nThere are only two bad curves coming out of the canyon, and I think we\r\ncan figure a way to take care of them. Maybe a team at each one.\r\n\r\n\"This would leave most of the horses free to snake the logs out of the\r\nhills to the road. I'm for cutting the horses to twenty-five, selecting\r\nthe best breeding stock we've got, and including the ones needed for\r\nemergency riding, such as the Sheriff has.\"\r\n\r\nFor another hour it was argued back and forth, but in the end the\r\nMayor's plan was adopted. Then Dr. Aylesworth, who had not previously\r\nspoken during the whole meeting, arose quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I think there's something we're forgetting, Gentlemen,\" he said.\r\n\"Something we've forgotten all along. Now that we are faced with our\r\nmost serious crisis yet, I suggest that you members of our city\r\ngovernment pass a resolution setting aside the next Sabbath as a special\r\nday of prayer. Ask the ministers of all our denominations to co-operate\r\nin offering special prayer services for the safety of our animals, which\r\nwe need so badly, and for the success of those who are working on\r\nCollege Hill and elsewhere to find a solution to this grave problem.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard nodded approvingly. \"We should have done it long ago,\" he\r\nagreed. \"If no one has any objections I will so declare as Dr.\r\nAylesworth has suggested.\" There were nods of approval from everyone in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBy dawn the next morning the crews were ready to begin the vaccination\r\nprogram. One by one, they examined the animals to make sure the best\r\nwere saved. The rest were slaughtered, examined for signs of anthrax,\r\nand most were prepared for storage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, while the cattle crews still worked, Ken and his parents\r\nattended services in Dr. Aylesworth's congregation. A solemnity was over\r\nthe whole valley, and the only sound anywhere seemed to be the tolling\r\nof the bells in the churches.\r\n\r\nThe anthrax outbreak had seemed to the people of Mayfield one more, and\r\nperhaps a final, proof that their hope of survival was beyond all\r\nrealization. Before, with severe rationing, it had seemed that they\r\nwould need a miracle to get them through the winter. Now, with the\r\nbrutally lessened supply of milk and breeding cattle, it seemed beyond\r\nthe power of any miracle.\r\n\r\nDr. Aylesworth's white mane behind the pulpit was like a symbol\r\ntestifying that they never need give up hope as long as any desire for\r\nlife was in them. In himself there seemed no doubt of their eventual\r\nsalvation, and in his sermon he pleaded with them to maintain their\r\nstrength and hope and faith.\r\n\r\nIn his prayer he asked, \"Father, bless our cattle and our beasts of\r\nburden that this illness that has stricken them may be healed. Bless us\r\nthat our hearts may not fail us in this time of trial, but teach us to\r\nbear our burdens that we may give thanks unto Thee when the day of our\r\nsalvation doth come. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12. _Decontamination_\r\n\r\n\r\nBy late November some drifts of snow on the flats were 3 feet deep. The\r\ntemperature dropped regularly to ten or more below zero at night and\r\nseldom went above freezing in the daytime. The level of the log pile in\r\nthe woodyard dropped steadily in spite of the concentrated efforts of\r\nnearly every available able-bodied man in the community to add to it.\r\nCrews cut all night long by the light of gasoline lanterns. The fuel\r\nration had to be lowered to meet their rate of cutting.\r\n\r\nThe deep snow hampered Mayor Hilliard's plan to sled the logs downhill\r\nwithout use of teams. Criticisms and grumblings at his decision to\r\nsacrifice the horses grew swiftly.\r\n\r\nThere had been no more signs of anthrax, and some were saying the whole\r\nprogram of vaccination and slaughter had been a stupid mistake. In spite\r\nof the assurance of the veterinarians that it was the only thing that\r\ncould have been done, the grumbling went on like a rolling wave as the\r\nseverity of the winter increased.\r\n\r\nThe Council was finally forced to issue a conservation order requiring\r\nfamilies to double up, two to a house, on the theory that it would be\r\nmore efficient to heat one house than parts of two. Selection of family\r\npairings was optional. Close friends and relatives moved together\r\nwherever possible. Where no selection was made the committee assigned\r\nfamilies to live together.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the order was issued, Ken's mother suggested they invite the\r\nLarsens to move in with them. The Swedish family was happy to accept.\r\n\r\nThanksgiving, when it came, was observed in spirit, but scarcely in\r\nfact. There were some suggestions that Mayor Hilliard should order\r\nspecial rations for that day and for Christmas, at least, but he stuck\r\nto his ironhard determination that every speck of food would be\r\nstretched to the limit. No special allowance would be made for\r\nThanksgiving or any other occasion until the danger was over.\r\n\r\nKen and his father and their friends had done their share of criticizing\r\nthe Mayor in the past, but they now had only increasing admiration for\r\nhis determination to take a stand for the principles he knew to be\r\nright, no matter how stern. Previously, most of the townspeople had\r\nconsidered him very good at giving highly patriotic Fourth of July\r\nspeeches, and not much good at anything else. Now, Ken realized, the\r\nbombastic little man seemed to have come alive, fully and miraculously\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day after Thanksgiving Ken and Professor Maddox were greeted by Mrs.\r\nMaddox upon coming home. \"Maria wants you to come to the radio shack\r\nright away,\" she said. \"There's something important coming in from\r\nBerkeley.\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the shack, and Maria looked up in relief as they\r\nentered. \"I'm so glad you're here!\" she cried. \"Dr. French is on the\r\nradio personally. I've been recording him, but he wants to talk to you.\r\nHe's breaking in every 10 minutes to give me a chance to let him know if\r\nyou're here. It's almost time, now.\"\r\n\r\nKen and his father caught a fragment of a sentence spoken by the\r\nBerkeley scientist, and then the operator came on. \"Berkeley requesting\r\nacknowledgment, Mayfield.\"\r\n\r\nKen picked up the microphone and answered. \"This is Mayfield, Ken Maddox\r\ntalking. My father is here and will speak with Dr. French.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox sat down at the desk. \"This is Professor Maddox,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I came in time to hear your last sentence, Dr. French. They tell\r\nme you have something important to discuss. Please go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nKen switched over to receive, and in a moment the calm, persuasive voice\r\nof Dr. French was heard in the speaker. \"I'm glad you came in, Dr.\r\nMaddox,\" he said. \"On the tape you have my report of some experiments we\r\nhave run the last few days. They are not finished, and if circumstances\r\nwere normal I would certainly not report a piece of work in this stage.\r\n\r\n\"I feel optimistic, however, that we are on the verge of a substantial\r\nbreakthrough in regard to the precipitant we are looking for. I would\r\nlike you to repeat the work I have reported and go on from there, using\r\nyour own ideas. I wanted you to have it, along with the people in\r\nPasadena, in case anything should happen here. In my opinion it could be\r\nonly a matter of days until we have a solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly hope you are right,\" said Professor Maddox. \"Why do you\r\nspeak of the possibility of something happening. Is there trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Rioting has broken out repeatedly in the entire Bay Area during\r\nthe past 3 days. Food supplies are almost non-existent. At the\r\nuniversity here, those of us remaining have our families housed in\r\nclassrooms. We have some small stock of food, but it's not enough for an\r\nindefinite stay. The rioting may sweep over us. The lack of food may\r\ndrive us out before we can finish. You are in a better position there\r\nfor survival purposes. I hope nothing happens to interrupt your work.\r\n\r\n\"Our local government is crumbling fast. They have attempted to supply\r\nthe community with seafood, but there are not enough sailing vessels.\r\nPerhaps two-thirds of the population have migrated. Some have returned.\r\nThousands have died. I feel our time is limited. Give my report your\r\ncareful attention and let me know your opinion tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThey broke contact, uneasiness filling the hearts of Dr. French's\r\nlisteners in Mayfield. Up to now, the Berkeley scientist had seemed\r\nimpassive and utterly objective. Now, to hear him speak of his own\r\npersonal disaster, induced in them some of his own premonition of\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nWhen Maria had typed the report Professor Maddox stayed up until the\r\nearly-morning hours, studying it, developing equations, and making\r\ncalculations of his own. Ken stayed with him, trying to follow the\r\nabstruse work, and follow his father's too-brief explanations.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, Professor Maddox was enthusiastic. \"I believe he's on\r\nthe right track,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, he hasn't told all he knows\r\nin this report. He must have been too excited about the work.\r\nOrdinarily, he leaves nothing out, but he's omitted three or four\r\nimportant steps near the end. I'll have to ask him to fill them in\r\nbefore we can do very much with his processes.\"\r\n\r\nThe report was read and discussed at the college laboratory the next\r\nday, and the scientists began preliminary work to duplicate Dr. French's\r\nresults. Ken and his father hurried home early in order to meet the\r\nafternoon schedule with Berkeley and get Dr. French to the microphone to\r\nanswer the questions he had neglected to consider.\r\n\r\nAs they arrived at the radio shack and opened the door they found Maria\r\ninside, with her head upon the desk. Deep sobs shook her body. The\r\nreceiver was on, but only the crackle of static came from it. The\r\nfilaments of the transmitter tubes were lit, but the antenna switch was\r\nopen. The tape recorder was still running.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox grasped Maria by the shoulders and drew her back in the\r\nchair. \"What is the matter?\" he exclaimed. \"Why are you crying, Maria?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all over,\" she said. \"There's nothing more down there. Just\r\nnothing...\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ken cried.\r\n\r\n\"It's on the tape. You can hear it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nKen quickly reversed the tape and turned it to play. In a moment the\r\nfamiliar voice of their Berkeley friend was heard. \"I'm glad you're\r\nearly,\" it said. \"There isn't much time today. The thing Dr. French\r\nfeared has happened.\r\n\r\n\"Half the Bay Area is in flames. On the campus here, the administration\r\nbuilding is gone. They tried to blow up the science building. It's\r\nburning pretty fast in the other wing. I'm on the third floor. Did I\r\never tell you I moved my stuff over here to be close to the lab?\r\n\r\n\"There must be a mob of a hundred thousand out there in the streets. Or\r\nrather, several hundred mobs that add up to that many. None of them know\r\nwhere they're going. It's like a monster with a thousand separate heads\r\ncut loose to thrash about before it dies. I see groups of fifty or a\r\nhundred running through the streets burning and smashing things.\r\nSometimes they meet another group coming from the opposite direction.\r\nThen they fight until the majority of one group is dead, and the others\r\nhave run away.\r\n\r\n\"The scientists were having a meeting here until an hour ago. They\r\ngathered what papers and notes they could and agreed that each would try\r\nto make his own way, with his family, out of the city. They agreed to\r\ntry to meet in Salinas 6 weeks from now, if possible. I don't think any\r\nof them will ever meet again.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden tenseness surged into the operator's voice. \"I can see him down\r\nthere!\" he cried in despair. \"Dr. French--he's running across the campus\r\nwith a load of books and a case of his papers and they're trying to get\r\nhim. He's on the brow of a little hill and the mob is down below.\r\nThey're laughing at him and shooting. They almost look like college\r\nstudents. He's down--they got him.\"\r\n\r\nA choking sob caught the operator's voice. \"That's all there is,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I hope you can do something with the information Dr. French gave\r\nyou yesterday. Berkeley is finished. I'm going to try to get out of here\r\nmyself now. I don't think I stand much of a chance. The mobs are\r\nswarming all over the campus. I can hear the fire on the other side of\r\nthe building. Maybe I won't even make it outside. Tell the Professor and\r\nKen so long. I sure wish I could have made it to Mayfield to see what\r\ngoes with that Swedish accent. 73 YL.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Professor Maddox announced his intention of going back to\r\nthe laboratory. Mrs. Maddox protested vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't sleep even if I went to bed,\" he said, \"thinking about\r\nwhat's happened today in Berkeley.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if a thing like that happened here?\" Mrs. Larsen asked with\r\nconcern. \"_Could_ it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're in a much better position than the metropolitan areas,\" said\r\nProfessor Maddox. \"I think we'll manage if we can keep our people from\r\ngetting panicky. It's easier, too, because there aren't so many of us.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Larsen went back to the laboratory with the Maddoxes.\r\nThroughout the night they reviewed the work of Dr. French. To Ken it\r\nseemed that they were using material out of the past, since all of those\r\nresponsible for it were probably dead.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to fill in these missing steps,\" said Professor Maddox. \"We\r\nknow what he started with and we know the end results at which he was\r\naiming. I think we can fill the gaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" said Professor Larsen. \"I think we should not neglect to\r\npass this to our people in Stockholm. You will see that is done?\" he\r\nasked Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Our next schedule in that area is day after tomorrow. Or I could get it\r\nto them on the emergency watch tomorrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Use emergency measures. I think it is of utmost importance that they\r\nhave this quickly.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the days passed, strangers were appearing more and more frequently in\r\nMayfield. Ken saw them on the streets as he went to the warehouse for\r\nhis family's food ration. He did not know everyone who lived in the\r\nvalley, of course, but he was sure some of the people he was meeting now\r\nwere total strangers, and there seemed so many of them.\r\n\r\nHe had heard stories of how some of them had come, one by one, or in\r\nsmall groups of a family or two. They had made their way from cities to\r\nthe north or the south, along the highway that passed through the\r\nvalley. They had come in rags, half-starved, out of the blizzards to the\r\nunexpected sanctuary of a town that still retained a vestige of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, Ken found this very subject was being discussed in the\r\nration lines when he reached the warehouse. People had in their hands\r\ncopies of the twice-weekly mimeographed newssheet put out by the\r\nCouncil. Across the top in capital letters was the word: PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nKen borrowed a sheet and read, \"According to the latest count we've made\r\nthrough the ration roll, there are now present in Mayfield almost three\r\nthousand people who are refugees from other areas and have come in since\r\nthe beginning of the disaster.\r\n\r\n\"As great as our humanitarian feelings are, and although we should like\r\nto be able to relieve the suffering of the whole world, if it were in\r\nour power to do so, it is obviously impossible. Our food supplies are at\r\nmere subsistence level now. Before next season's crops are in, it may be\r\nnecessary to reduce them still further.\r\n\r\n\"In view of this fact, the Mayor and the City Council have determined to\r\nissue a proclamation as of this date that every citizen of Mayfield will\r\nbe registered and numbered and no rations will be issued except by\r\nproper identification and number. It is hereby ordered that no one\r\nhereafter shall permit the entrance of any stranger who was not a\r\nresident of Mayfield prior to this date.\r\n\r\n\"A barbed-wire inclosure is to be constructed around the entire\r\nresidential and business district, and armed guards will be posted\r\nagainst all refugees who may attempt to enter. Crews will be assigned to\r\nthe erection of the fence, and guard duty will be rotated among the male\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nKen passed the sheet back to his neighbor. His mind felt numb as he\r\nthought of some of those he had seen shuffling through the deep snow in\r\ntown. He knew now how he had known they were strangers. Their pinched,\r\nhaunted faces showed the evidence of more privation and hardship than\r\nany in Mayfield had yet known. These were the ones who would be turned\r\naway from now on.\r\n\r\nKen heard the angry buzz of comments all around him. \"Should have done\r\nit long ago,\" a plump woman somewhere behind him was saying. \"What right\r\nhave they got to come in and eat our food?\"\r\n\r\nA man at the head of the line was saying, \"They ought to round them all\r\nup and make them move on. Three thousand--that would keep the people\r\nwho've got a right here going a long time.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone else, not quite so angry, said, \"They're people just like us.\r\nYou know what the Bible says about that. We ought to share as long as we\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, and pretty soon there won't be anything for anybody to share!\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be true, but it's what we're supposed to do. It's what we've\r\n_got_ to do if we're going to stay human. I'll take anybody into my\r\nhouse who knocks on my door.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you see your kids crying for food you can't give them you'll\r\nchange your tune!\"\r\n\r\nJust ahead of him in line Ken saw a small, silent woman who looked about\r\nwith darting glances of fear. She was trembling with fright as much as\r\nwith the cold that penetrated her thin, ragged, cloth coat.\r\n\r\nShe was one of them, Ken thought. She was one who had come from the\r\noutside. He wondered which of the loud-mouthed ones beside him would be\r\nwilling to be the first to take her beyond the bounds of Mayfield and\r\nforce her to move on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night, at dinner, he spoke of it to his parents and the Larsens.\r\n\r\n\"It's a problem that has to be faced,\" said Professor Maddox, \"and\r\nHilliard is choosing the solution he thinks is right. He's no more\r\nheartless than Dr. Aylesworth, for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a horrible thing,\" said Mrs. Larsen. \"What will happen to\r\nthose who are turned away?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will die,\" said Dr. Larsen. \"They will go away and wander in the\r\nsnow until they die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we have any more right to live than they?\" asked Mrs.\r\nMaddox. \"How can we go on eating and being comfortable while they are\r\nout there?\"\r\n\r\n\"_They_ are out there in the whole world,\" said Dr. Larsen as if\r\nmeditating. \"There must be thirty million who have died in the United\r\nStates alone since this began. Another hundred million will die this\r\nwinter. The proportion will be the same in the rest of the world. Should\r\nwe be thankful for our preservation so far, or should we voluntarily\r\njoin them in death?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is different,\" said Mrs. Maddox. \"It's those who come and beg for\r\nour help who will be on our consciences if we do this thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world would come if it knew we had stores of food here--if it\r\ncould come. As brutal as it is, the Mayor has taken the only feasible\r\ncourse open to him.\"\r\n\r\nKen and Maria remained silent, both feeling the horror of the proposal\r\nand its inevitability.\r\n\r\nIn the following days Ken was especially glad to be able to bury himself\r\nin the problems at the laboratory. His father, too, seemed to work with\r\nincreasing fury as they got further into an investigation of the\r\nmaterial originated by Dr. French. As if seized by some fanatic\r\ncompulsion, unable to stop, Professor Maddox spent from 18 to 20 hours\r\nof every day at his desk and laboratory bench.\r\n\r\nKen stayed with him although he could not match his father's great\r\nenergy. He often caught snatches of sleep while his father worked on.\r\nThen, one morning, as an especially long series of complex tests came to\r\nan end at 3 a.m., he said to Ken in quiet exultation, \"We can\r\ndecontaminate now, if nothing else. That's the thing that French had\r\nfound. Whether we can ever put it into the atmosphere is another matter,\r\nbut at least we can get our metals clean.\"\r\n\r\nExcited, Ken leaned over the notebook while his father described the\r\nresults of the reaction. He studied the photographs, taken with the\r\nelectron microscope, of a piece of steel before and after treatment with\r\na compound developed by his father.\r\n\r\nKen said slowly, in a voice full of emotion. \"French didn't do this,\r\nDad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of it. I finished it up from where he left off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He wasn't even on the same track. You've gone in an entirely\r\ndifferent direction from the one his research led to. _You_ are the one\r\nwho has developed a means of cleaning the dust out of metals.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox looked away. \"You give me too much credit, Son.\"\r\n\r\nKen continued to look at his father, at the thick notebook whose\r\nscrawled symbols told the story. So this is the way it happens, he\r\nthought. You don't set out to be a great scientist at all. If you can\r\nput all other things out of your mind, if you can be absorbed with your\r\nwhole mind and soul in a problem that seems important enough, even\r\nthough the world is collapsing about your head; then, if you are clever\r\nenough and persevering enough, you may find yourself a great scientist\r\nwithout ever having tried.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever be what the world calls a great scientist,\"\r\nProfessor Maddox had said on that day that seemed so long ago. \"I'm not\r\nclever enough; I don't think fast enough. I can teach the fundamentals\r\nof chemistry, and maybe some of those I teach will be great someday.\"\r\n\r\nSo he had gone along, Ken thought, and by applying his own rules he had\r\nachieved greatness. \"I think you give me far too much credit, Son,\" he\r\nsaid in a tired voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13. _Stay Out of Town!_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took a surprisingly short time to ring Mayfield with a barbed-wire\r\nbarricade. A large stock of steel fence posts was on hand in the local\r\nfarm supply stores, and these could be driven rapidly even in the frozen\r\nground. There was plenty of wire. What more was needed, both of wire and\r\nposts, was taken from adjacent farmland fences, and by the end of the\r\nweek following the Mayor's pronouncement the task was completed and the\r\nguards were at their posts.\r\n\r\nIn all that time there had been no occasion to turn anyone away, but\r\nsentiment both for and against the program was heavy and bitter within\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after completion of the fence, Dr. Aylesworth chose to\r\nspeak of it in his sermon. He had advertised that he would do so. The\r\nchurch was not only packed, but large numbers of people stood outside in\r\nthe freezing weather listening through the doors. Even greater\r\nexcitement was stirred by the whispered information that Mayor Hilliard\r\nwas sitting in the center of the congregation.\r\n\r\nThe minister had titled his sermon, \"My Brother's Keeper.\" He opened by\r\nsaying, \"Am I my brother's keeper? We know the answer to that question,\r\nmy friends. For all the thousands of years that man has been struggling\r\nupward he has been developing the answer to that question. We know it,\r\neven though we may not always abide by it.\r\n\r\n\"We know who our brothers are--all mankind, whether in Asia or in Europe\r\nor next door to our own home. These are our brothers.\"\r\n\r\nAs he elaborated on the theme, Ken thought that this was his mother's\r\nbelief which she had expressed when the fence was first mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot help those in distant lands,\" said Dr. Aylesworth. \"As much\r\nas our hearts go out to them and are touched with compassion at their\r\nplight, we can do nothing for them. For those on our own doorstep,\r\nhowever, it is a different matter.\r\n\r\n\"We are being told now by our civil authorities in this community that\r\nwe must drive away at the point of a gun any who come holding out their\r\nhands for succor and shelter. We are told we must drive them away to\r\ncertain death.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you if we do this thing, no matter what the outcome of our\r\npresent condition, we shall never be able to look one another in the\r\neye. We shall never be able to look at our own image without remembering\r\nthose whom we turned away when they came to us for help. I call upon you\r\nto petition our civil authorities to remove this brutal and inhumane\r\nrestriction in order that we may be able to behave as the civilized men\r\nand women we think we have become. Although faced with disaster, we are\r\nnot yet without a voice in our own actions, and those who have made this\r\nunholy ruling can be persuaded to relent if the voices of the people are\r\nloud enough!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down amid a buzz of whispered comment. Then all eyes turned\r\nsuddenly at the sound of a new voice in the hall. Mayor Hilliard was on\r\nhis feet and striding purposefully toward the pulpit.\r\n\r\n\"Reverend, you've had your say, and now I think I've got a right to have\r\nmine. I know this is your bailiwick and you can ask me to leave if you\r\nwant to. However, these are my people six days a week to your one. Will\r\nyou let me say my piece?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Aylesworth rose again, a smile of welcome on his face. \"I think we\r\nshare the people, or, rather, they share us on all 7 days of the week,\"\r\nhe said. \"I will be happy to have you use this pulpit to deliver any\r\nmessage you may care to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Mayor Hilliard as he mounted the platform and stood\r\nbehind the pulpit. \"Dr. Aylesworth and I,\" he began, \"have been good\r\nfriends for a long time. We usually see eye to eye on most things, but\r\nin this we are dead opposite.\r\n\r\n\"What he says is true enough. If enough of you want to protest what I've\r\ndone you can have a change, but that change will have to include a new\r\nmayor and a new set of councilmen. I was elected, and the Council was\r\nelected to make rules and regulations for the welfare of this community\r\nas long as we were in office.\r\n\r\n\"We've made this rule about allowing no more refugees in Mayfield and\r\nit's going to stand as long as we're in office. By next summer, if the\r\nharvest is even a few days late, your children are going to be standing\r\naround crying for food you can't give them, and you are going to have to\r\ncut your supplies to one-fifth their normal size. That's the way it adds\r\nup after we count all the people in the valley, and all the cases and\r\nsacks of food in the warehouses.\r\n\r\n\"It's just plain arithmetic. If we keep adding more people we're all\r\ngoing to get closer and closer to starvation, and finally wake up one\r\nmorning and find we've gone over the edge of it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if that's what you want, just go ahead and get some city officers\r\nwho will arrange it for you. If anybody in this town, including you, Dr.\r\nAylesworth, can think of a more workable answer or one that makes\r\nbetter sense than the one we've got I'd like to know about it.\"\r\n\r\nIt snowed heavily that afternoon out of a bitter, leaden sky. It started\r\nin the midst of the morning service, and by the time the congregation\r\ndispersed it was difficult to see a block away.\r\n\r\nThere was little comment about what they had heard, among the people\r\nleaving the church. They walked with heads bowed against the snow toward\r\ntheir cold homes and sparsely filled pantries.\r\n\r\nThe community chapel was near the edge of town. One of the boundary\r\nfences lay only two blocks away. From that direction, as the crowd\r\ndispersed, there came the sudden sound of a shot. It was muffled under\r\nthe heavy skies and the dense snow, but there was no mistaking the\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nKen jerked his head sharply. \"That must have been one of the guards!\" he\r\nsaid. His father nodded. Together, they raced in the direction of the\r\nsound. Others began running, too, their hearts pounding in anticipation\r\nof some crisis that might settle the unanswered questions.\r\n\r\nKen noticed ahead of them, through the veil of snow, the chunky figure\r\nof Mayor Hilliard running as rapidly as he could. As they came to the\r\nfence they saw the guard standing on one side, his rifle lowered and\r\nready. On the other side of the barbed-wire enclosure was a stout,\r\nmiddle-aged man. He wore an overcoat, but there was no hat on his head.\r\nHis face was drawn with agony and uncomprehending despair.\r\n\r\nHe staggered on his feet as he pleaded in a tired voice. \"You've got to\r\nlet me come in. I've walked all the way in this blizzard. I haven't had\r\nany food for two days.\"\r\n\r\nA group of churchgoers lined the fence now, additional ones coming up\r\nslowly, almost reluctantly, but knowing they had to witness what was\r\nabout to take place. Ken exclaimed hoarsely to his father, \"That's Sam\r\nBaker! He runs the drugstore and newsstand in Frederick. Everybody in\r\nMayfield knows Sam Baker!\"\r\n\r\nSam Baker turned in bewildered, helpless pleading to the crowd lined on\r\nthe other side of the fence. Mayor Hilliard stood back a dozen yards\r\nfrom the wire.\r\n\r\n\"You've got to help me,\" Sam Baker begged. \"You can't make me go back\r\nall that way. It's 50 miles. There's nothing there. They're all dead or\r\nlost in the snow. Give me something to eat, please...\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to move on,\" the guard said mechanically. \"Nobody gets in.\r\nThat's the law here.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the fence, people pressed close, and one or two men started\r\nhesitantly to climb. Mayor Hilliard's voice rang out, \"Anybody who goes\r\non the other side of that fence _stays_ on the other side!\"\r\n\r\nThe men climbed down. No one said anything. Sam Baker scanned them with\r\nhis helpless glance once more. Then he turned slowly. Fifty feet from\r\nthe fence he fell in the snow, face down.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard spoke slowly and clearly once more. \"If anyone so much as\r\nthrows a crust of bread over that fence the guard has orders to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nAs if frozen, the onlookers remained immobile. The guard held his fixed\r\nstance. Mayor Hilliard stood, feet apart, his hands in his pockets,\r\nstaring defiantly. On the other side of the fence, the thick flakes of\r\nsnow were rapidly covering the inert form of Sam Baker. In only a few\r\nmoments he would be obliterated from their sight. That would be the\r\nsignal for them all to turn and go home, Ken thought.\r\n\r\nImpulsively, he took a step forward. He looked at his father's face.\r\n\"Dad...\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox touched Ken's arm with a restraining hand. His face was\r\ngrim and churned by conflicting desires.\r\n\r\nThe utter stillness was broken then by the crunching sound of boots in\r\nthe snow. All eyes turned to the powerful, white-maned figure that\r\napproached. Dr. Aylesworth was hatless and the snow was thick in his\r\nhair. He paused a moment, comprehending the situation. Then he strode\r\nforward to the fence.\r\n\r\nHe put a foot on the wire, and climbed. His coat caught on the barbs as\r\nhe jumped to the other side. He ripped it free, ignoring the tear of the\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard watched as if hypnotized. He jerked himself, finally, out\r\nof his immobility. \"Parson!\" he cried. \"Come back here!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Aylesworth ignored the command. He strode forward with unwavering\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\"It's no different with you than it is with any other man,\" Hilliard\r\nshouted. He took the gun from the guard. \"You're breaking the law. If\r\nyou don't stop I'll shoot!\"\r\n\r\nThe majestic figure of the minister turned. He faced Hilliard without\r\nhesitation. \"Shoot,\" he said. He turned back and moved once more to the\r\nfallen druggist.\r\n\r\nThere was sweat on Mayor Hilliard's face now. He brushed it with a\r\ngloved hand. His hat fell unnoticed to the ground. He raised the gun no\r\nhigher. \"Aylesworth,\" he called, and his voice was pleading now, \"we've\r\ngot to do what's right!\"\r\n\r\nThe minister's voice came back to him, hollowly, as if from an immense\r\ndistance. \"Yes, we've got to do what's right.\" Dr. Aylesworth could be\r\nseen faintly through the veil of snow as he bent down, raising the\r\ndruggist's heavy form to his own back in a fireman's carry, then turning\r\nto retrace his steps.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard let the gun sag in his hands. At the fence Dr. Aylesworth\r\npaused. \"Separate those wires,\" he ordered those standing near.\r\n\r\nThey hastily obeyed, pressing their feet on the lower wire, raising the\r\ncenter one. \"Take him!\" the minister commanded. He rolled the figure of\r\nSam Baker gently through the opening and crawled through himself.\r\n\"Bring him to my house,\" he said. Without a glance at the Mayor, he\r\nstrode off through the parted crowd and disappeared.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the onlookers followed, slowly, never glancing at the\r\nimmobile figure of the Mayor. Hilliard watched the last of them fade\r\ninto the snow curtain, and he stood there alone, still holding the gun\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nThe guard came up at last. \"Do you want me to keep on here, Mr.\r\nHilliard?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I still say it was the only thing to do,\" said Mrs. Maddox at the\r\ndinner table. \"How could anyone claim to be human and think of leaving\r\npoor Mr. Baker lying there in the snow?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the only thing Dr. Aylesworth could do,\" said Professor Maddox.\r\n\"Mayor Hilliard did the only thing _he_ could do. Which was right, and\r\nwhich was wrong--I don't think any of us are really sure any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose may come of this?\" asked Professor Larsen.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Ken's father admitted. \"There's a lot of excitement in\r\ntown. A fellow named Meggs is stirring up talk against Hilliard. He's\r\nthe storekeeper who tried to hold a profiteering sale, you remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard there were some fights in town after church,\" said Maria.\r\n\r\nKen nodded. \"Yes, I heard about them, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It mustn't start here!\" exclaimed Mrs. Larsen. \"That must be the way it\r\nbegan in Chicago and Berkeley. We can't let it happen here!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days a kind of unspoken truce seemed to reign over\r\nthe town. It was rumored that both Mayor Hilliard and Dr. Aylesworth\r\nwere waiting for the other to come for a talk, but that neither was\r\nwilling to go first under the circumstances. Orders had been given that\r\nSam Baker was to get no special ration. He would get only what others\r\nshared with him out of their own meager allotment.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory on College Hill it was confirmed that Professor Maddox\r\nhad indeed discovered a completely effective means of cleansing metals\r\nof the destroying dust. Art Matthews and the science club boys were once\r\nagain scouring the town for engine parts that could be cleaned and used\r\nin assembling new and, this time, workable engines.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning Professor Douglas came in late, after all the others\r\nhad been there for a couple of hours. He was panting from his rapid walk\r\nup the hill. \"Have you heard the news?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe others looked up. \"What news?\" Professor Maddox asked.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of farmers and ranchers from the south end of the valley rode\r\nin about 3 o'clock this morning. They were half-dead. They said their\r\nplaces and several others had been attacked last night. Everything in\r\nthe whole southern part of the valley, beyond the point, has been looted\r\nand burned. Six families, still living on their own places were wiped\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did it?\" Professor Larsen exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Nomads! The ranchers say there's a band of over three thousand camped\r\ndown by Turnerville, about 20 miles from here. They've been moving\r\nacross the country, killing and looting everything that's in their way.\r\nNow they're headed for Mayfield. They've heard about us having a big\r\ncache of supplies.\"\r\n\r\nAll work in the laboratory ceased as the men gathered around Professor\r\nDouglas. They stared into the distance, but their thoughts were alike.\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand,\" said Professor Maddox slowly. \"We could put twice\r\nthat many good men against them. We ought to be able to stand them off,\r\nif they attack. What's Hilliard doing about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants us all down there this morning. There doesn't seem to be much\r\nquestion about him staying on as Mayor since this came up.\"\r\n\r\nIn a group the men left the half-completed experiments and made their\r\nway down the hill to the City Hall. When they arrived they found the\r\nCouncil chamber already filled. The Mayor and the councilmen were at\r\ntheir conference table on the platform in front of the room.\r\n\r\nAt one side, facing both the leaders and the audience, were three\r\nragged, unshaven strangers in heavy boots and ill-fitting coats. They\r\nhad not bothered to remove the fur-lined caps from their heads.\r\n\r\nNomads, Ken thought. It was apparent what was going on.\r\n\r\n\"We're coming in,\" the center man was saying. His massive size and\r\nstrength showed even under the thick covering of clothes. \"I say we're\r\ncoming in, and we either come peaceable and you treat us right or we\r\ncome in our own way. It doesn't make much difference to us how we do it.\r\nYou just call the shots, Mister, and we'll play it your way. We've got\r\ntwo thousand armed men who know how to shoot fast and straight because\r\nthey've done a lot of it the last two months. They're the ones that shot\r\nfaster and straighter than the guys they were shooting at.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to live here peaceably with us, is that it?\" questioned Mayor\r\nHilliard.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed harshly. \"Why sure! We're peaceful people, aren't we,\r\nMen?\" He took reassurance from his grinning companions. \"Just as\r\npeaceful as them around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about those ranch families you murdered last night?\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker laughed again. \"They didn't want peace, did they, Men? All\r\nwe asked for was a little something to eat and they started an argument\r\nwith us. We just don't like arguments.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard glanced beyond the table to the first row of listeners.\r\nHis glance fell upon Dr. Aylesworth. \"Before giving my consent to your\r\ncoming in,\" he said slowly, \"I'd like to hear from one of our more\r\nprominent citizens. This is Dr. Aylesworth, one of our ministers. Would\r\nyou like to tell these people how we feel about their proposal,\r\nReverend?\"\r\n\r\nThe minister rose slowly, his eyes never leaving the three nomads. \"It\r\nwill be a pleasure to tell them.\" Then to the three he said, \"You can go\r\nright back where you came from. That's our answer to your proposal.\"\r\n\r\nThe big man snarled. \"So that's the way you want it, is it? Well then,\r\nwe'll be back, and when we come you'll wish you'd sung a different\r\ntune!\"\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard smiled a wry smile. \"I didn't expect our minister to be\r\nquite so unfeeling of your plight. Since I am in agreement with his\r\nviews, however, I must say that you will not be back, because you are\r\nnot going anywhere. Sheriff, arrest these men!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly, the big man dropped his hand to his pocket. Before his gun\r\nwas halfway out, a shot rang from the rear doorway of the crowded room.\r\nThe stranger dropped to the platform like a crumpled bull.\r\n\r\n\"You're covered,\" said Hilliard to the other two. \"You came here with a\r\nwhite flag, but it had our people's blood all over it. We are not\r\nviolating any truce because this is not an affair of honor among\r\ngentlemen. It's going to be only an extermination of wild beasts!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14. _Mobilization_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two nomads stood glaring and snarling before the drawn revolvers\r\nthat pointed at them from the doorways of the room. For an instant it\r\nlooked as if they were going to draw their own weapons and make a\r\npitched battle of it right there in the Council chamber. Then their\r\nglances fell on their comrade, writhing in pain on the floor. They\r\nraised their hands in slow surrender.\r\n\r\n\"If we're not back by sundown, you'll be wiped out!\"\r\n\r\n\"When will the attack begin if you do go back?\" asked Hilliard bitterly.\r\n\"Two hours before sundown? We thank you for the information about your\r\ntimetable, at least. We have 3 hours to prepare a defense of the town.\"\r\nHe nodded to the policeman. \"Take them away. Put them in cells and tie\r\nthem up until this is over.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had been removed he turned back to the group. \"I've had\r\nnightmares,\" he said, \"and this has been one of them. I guess if I had\r\nbeen the Mayor some people think I ought to have been, we would have\r\nbeen drilling and rehearsing our defenses for weeks. I had planned to do\r\nso soon. I thought we'd have more time; that's my only excuse.\r\n\r\n\"The Sheriff and I have done a little preliminary planning and thinking.\r\nWe've made an estimate of weapons available. From what Jack Nelson and\r\nDan Sims report on hunting licenses issued locally a year ago, there\r\nmust be about two thousand deer rifles in town. They also guess about\r\nfour or five hundred 22's. We're lucky to live in hunting country.\r\n\r\n\"Dan and Jack have about two hundred guns of all kinds and sizes in\r\ntheir rental and selling stock, and they've got nearly all the\r\nammunition in the valley. They had stocked up for the hunting season,\r\nwhich we never had this year, so their supply sounds as if it would be\r\npretty good. You've got to remember the difference in requirements for\r\nbagging a deer and carrying on a war. We have very little ammunition\r\nwhen you consider it from that angle.\r\n\r\n\"The police, of course, have a few guns and some rounds. I'm placing\r\nSheriff Johnson in full charge of defense. The police officers will act\r\nas his lieutenants.\" The Mayor stepped to a wall chart that showed the\r\ndetailed topography of Mayfield and its environs. \"This is your battle\r\nmap right here, Sheriff. Come up and start marking off your sectors of\r\nthe defense perimeter and name your officers to take charge of each. I\r\nhope somebody is going to say it's a good thing we've got the\r\nbarbed-wire defense line before this meeting is over!\r\n\r\n\"I want a rider to leave at once to bring back the wood detail. All\r\ntheir horses will be turned over to the police officers for use in their\r\ncommands. I want fifty runners to go through town and notify one man in\r\neach block to mobilize his neighbors, with all weapons available, and\r\nlead them to the sectors which the Sheriff will designate. Each man will\r\nbring all the ammunition he owns. Additional stores will be distributed\r\nby wagon to the sectors. Above everything else, each man must be warned\r\nto make each shot count.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent, and there was no protest or disagreement. Mayor\r\nHilliard, the man who had made fancy speeches, seemed to have vanished.\r\nHilliard, the dynamic, down-to-earth leader had taken his place. For a\r\nmoment no one in the room was more surprised than Hilliard himself.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing I want to make absolutely clear,\" he said after a\r\npause. \"You people who are working at the laboratory on College Hill are\r\nto keep away from the front-lines and away from all possible danger.\r\nThat's an order, you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Professor Maddox abruptly. \"It's our duty as much as anyone\r\nelse's to share in the defenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your duty to keep your skins whole and get back into the\r\nlaboratories as quickly as you can and get things running again! We\r\nhaven't any special desire to save your necks in preference to our own,\r\nbut in the long run you're the only hope any of us has got. Remember\r\nthat, and stay out of trouble!\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff made his appointments in rapid-fire sequence, naming many\r\nwho were not present, ordering messengers sent to them. Ken volunteered\r\nto ride after the wood detail.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it's safe enough to let you do that,\" the Mayor said. \"Make it\r\nfast, but don't break your neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it easy,\" Ken promised.\r\n\r\nOutside, he selected the best of the three police horses and headed up\r\nout of town, over the brittle snow with its glare ever-reminding of the\r\ncomet. When he was on higher ground, he glanced back over the length of\r\nthe valley. The nomads were not in sight. Not in force, anyway. He\r\nthought he glimpsed a small movement a mile or two away from the\r\nbarrier, at the south end of the valley before it turned out of sight at\r\nthe point, but he wasn't sure. Once he thought he heard a rifle shot,\r\nbut he wasn't sure of that, either.\r\n\r\nAs he appeared at the edge of the forest clearing, Mark Wilson, foreman\r\nof the detail, frowned irritably and paused in his task of snaking a log\r\nout to the road.\r\n\r\n\"You'll ruin that horse, besides breaking your neck, riding like that in\r\nthis snow. You're not on detail, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get all your men and horses up here right away,\" Ken said. \"Mayor's\r\norders to get back to town at once.\" He told briefly the story of what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nMark Wilson did not hesitate. He raised a whistle to his lips and\r\nsignaled for the men to cease work and assemble. One by one they began\r\nto appear from among the trees. The horses were led along, their\r\ndragging harnesses clanking in the frozen air. \"We could cut for 2 more\r\nhours,\" they protested. \"No use wasting this daylight and having to cut\r\nby lantern.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Wilson. \"There's something else to do. Wait for the\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all had assembled he jerked his head toward Ken. \"Go ahead,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You tell them.\"\r\n\r\nKen repeated in detail everything that had happened. He outlined the\r\nMayor's plan of defense and passed on the order for them to take all\r\nmounts to City Hall, to go by their own homes on the way and pick up\r\nsuch weapons as they owned. \"You'll get your further orders there,\" he\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThe group was silent, as if they could not believe it was actually\r\nhappening. Mark Wilson broke the spell that seemed to be over them.\r\n\"Come on!\" he cried. \"Get the lead out of your shoes and let's get down\r\nthere! Sunset's the deadline!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a rush of motion then. They hitched up the necessary teams and\r\nclimbed aboard the half-filled sleds. There was no excitement or\r\nswearing against fate and their enemies. Rather, a solemn stillness\r\nseemed to fill each man as the sleds moved off down the hard, frozen\r\nroadway.\r\n\r\nAlmost, but not quite the same pervading stillness was present in the\r\ntown when Ken returned. There was a stirring of frantic activity like\r\nthat of a disturbed anthill, but it was just as silent. The runners\r\nmoved from block to block. In their wake the alarmed block leaders\r\nraced, weapons in hand, from house to house, arousing their neighbors.\r\nMany, who had already completed the block mobilization, were moving in\r\nragged formations to the sector ordered by the block runner according to\r\nSheriff Johnson's plan.\r\n\r\nKen did not know what was planned for the many weaponless men who were\r\nbeing assembled. They would be useless at the frontline. There was need\r\nfor some at the rear. He supposed Johnson would take care of that later\r\nwhen every weapon was manned at the defense barrier.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at his own house. His mother greeted him anxiously. He could\r\nsee she had been crying, but she had dried her tears now and was\r\nreconciled to the inevitable struggle that was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your father came in a few minutes ago, and left again,\" she said. \"He's\r\nbeen placed in charge of distribution of medical supplies under Dr.\r\nAdams. He wants you and the other boys of the club to help in arranging\r\nlocations for medical care. Meet him at Dr. Adams' office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Mom. How about packing a load of sandwiches? I may not be back\r\nfor a long time. I don't know what arrangements they are making for\r\nfeeding the people on duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. I'll make them right away.\" She hurried to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nMaria said, \"There must be something I can do. They'll need nurses and\r\naides. I want to go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what they've planned in that department, either. They\r\nought to have plenty of room for women in the food and nursing details.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother came with the sandwiches and placed them in his hands. \"Be\r\ncareful, Ken.\" Her voice shook. \"Do be careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Mom.\"\r\n\r\nMaria got her coat. Mrs. Larsen let her go without protest, but the two\r\nwomen watched anxiously as the young people rode toward town on the\r\npolice horse.\r\n\r\nAt the doctor's office, Ken found his father surrounded by an orderly\r\nwhirl of activity. \"Ken! I was hoping you'd get back soon. You can help\r\nwith arrangements for hospital care, in assigned homes. The rest of your\r\nfriends are out on their streets. Take this set of instructions Dr.\r\nAdams has prepared and see that arrangements are made in exact\r\naccordance with them at each house on the list.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can help, too,\" said Maria.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Dr. Adams has prepared a list of women and girls he wants to\r\nassign as nurses and aides. You can help contact them. Get the ones on\r\nthis list to meet here as quickly as possible and they'll be assigned to\r\nthe houses which the boys are lining up.\"\r\n\r\nThe comet was setting earlier now, so that its unnatural light\r\ndisappeared almost as soon as the sun set below the horizon. In the\r\nshort period of twilight, tension grew in the city. Everything possible\r\nhad been done to mount defenses. An attack had been promised if the\r\nnomad emissaries did not return. Now the time had come.\r\n\r\nDarkness fell with no sign of activity in any direction. It seemed\r\nunreasonable that any kind of night attack would be launched, but\r\nHilliard and Johnson warned their men not to relax their vigilance.\r\n\r\nThe pace of preparatory activity continued. Blankets, clothing and food\r\nwere brought to the men who waited along the defense perimeter. Medical\r\narrangements were perfected as much as possible.\r\n\r\nKen and his father made their quarters in another room of the building\r\nwhere Dr. Adams' office was. There was no heat, of course, but they had\r\nbrought sleeping bags which were unrolled on the floor. After the\r\nsandwiches were gone their rations were canned soup, to be eaten\r\ndirectly from the can without being heated.\r\n\r\nMaria was quartered elsewhere in the building with some of the women who\r\nwere directing the nurses' activities.\r\n\r\nThrough the windows could be seen the campfires which Johnson had\r\npermitted to be built at the guard posts. Each had a wall of snow ready\r\nto be pushed upon it in case of any sign of attack.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better get some sleep,\" Professor Maddox said finally to Ken.\r\n\"They'll take care of anything that's going to happen out there tonight.\r\nWe may have a rough day tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nKen agreed, although he did not feel like sleeping. After hours, it\r\nseemed, of thrashing restlessly he dozed off. He thought it was dawn\r\nwhen he opened his eyes again to the faint, red glow reflected on the\r\nwalls of the room. He was unaware for a moment of where he was. Then he\r\nsaw the glow was flickering.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled to his feet and ran to the window. In the distance the glow\r\nof burning houses lit the landscape. The rapid crack of rifle fire came\r\nfaintly to his ears.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox was beside him. \"How could they do it?\" Ken exclaimed.\r\n\"How could they get through our lines and set fire to the houses?\"\r\n\r\nOn the southern sector of the defense line Sheriff Johnson's men\r\ncrouched behind their improvised defenses. The glow of the fire blinded\r\nthem as they attempted to pierce the darkness from which the attack was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nFrom a half-dozen different points fireballs were being lobbed out of\r\nthe darkness. Ineffective on the snow-laden roofs, many others crashed\r\nthrough the windows and rolled on the floors inside. Such targets became\r\nflaming infernos within minutes.\r\n\r\nThey were all unoccupied because the inhabitants had been moved closer\r\nto the center of town for protection.\r\n\r\nA fusillade of shots poured out of the darkness upon the well-lighted\r\ndefenders. They answered the fire, shooting at the pinpoints of light\r\nthat betrayed the enemy's position, and at the spots in the darkness\r\nfrom which the flaming fireballs came. It was obvious that the attackers\r\nwere continuously moving. It was difficult to know where the launching\r\ncrews of the fireball catapults were actually located in that\r\noverwhelming darkness.\r\n\r\nSheriff Johnson was on the scene almost at once. He had once been an\r\ninfantry lieutenant with combat experience. His presence boosted the\r\nmorale of the defenders immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your fire,\" he ordered the men. \"Keep under cover and wait until\r\nyou can see something worth shooting at. Try to keep the fire from\r\nspreading, and watch for a rush attack. Don't waste ammunition! You'll\r\nfind yourselves without any if you keep that up.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly, they ceased firing and fell back to the protection of their\r\nbarricades. Patrolman John Sykes, who was lieutenant of the sector, had\r\nbeen in the National Guard, but he had never seen anything like this.\r\n\"Do you think they'll rush us?\" he asked. \"Tonight, I mean, in the\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? They may be crazy enough to try anything. Keep your eyes\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\nThe flames quickly burned out the interiors of the houses that had been\r\nhit. As the roofs crashed in, their burden of snow assisted in putting\r\nout the fires, and there was no spreading to nearby houses.\r\n\r\nIn his room, Ken dressed impatiently. It was useless to try to sleep any\r\nmore. \"I wish they'd let us go out there,\" he said. \"We've got as much\r\nright as Johnson or any of the rest.\"\r\n\r\nHis father remained a motionless silhouette against the distant\r\nfirelight. \"As much right, perhaps,\" he said, \"but more and different\r\nresponsibilities. Hilliard is right. If we were knocked down out there\r\nwho would take over the work in the laboratory? Johnson? Adams?\r\n\r\n\"In Berkeley there are thousands fighting each other, but with French\r\nand his group gone, no one is fighting the comet. I don't think it is\r\nselfish to say we are of infinitely more value in the laboratory than we\r\ncould ever be out there with guns in our hands.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and smiled in the half-darkness. \"That's in spite of the fact\r\nthat you have the merit badge for marksmanship and won the hunting club\r\ntrophy last year.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an hour the attack ceased, apparently because the defenders\r\nrefused to waste their fire on the impossible targets. Sheriff Johnson\r\nsent word around for his men to resume rotation of watch and get all the\r\nsleep possible before the day that was ahead of them.\r\n\r\nThe fires burned themselves out shortly before dawn. Their light was\r\nfollowed soon by the glow of the comet rising in the southeast. Ken\r\nwatched it and thought of Granny Wicks. It wouldn't be hard, he thought,\r\nto understand how a belief in omens could arise. It wouldn't be hard at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe sky had cleared so that the light of the comet bathed the entire\r\ncountryside in its full, bitter glory. At sunrise the faint trickles of\r\nsmoke rose from hundreds of wood fires, started with the difficult green\r\nfuel, and stringent breakfasts were prepared. A thought went through\r\nKen's mind and he wondered if anybody was taking note of the supply of\r\nmatches in town. When they ran low, coals of one fire would have to be\r\nkept to light another.\r\n\r\nIt was 9 o'clock, on a day when ordinarily school bells would have been\r\nsounding throughout the valley. The first war shouts of the attacking\r\nnomads were heard on the plain to the south. About thirty men on\r\nhorseback raced single file along the highway that bore the hard, frozen\r\ntracks of horses and sleds that had moved to and from the farms down\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nPatrolman Sykes watched them through his glasses. His command rang out\r\nto his company. \"Hold fire.\" He knew the nomads would not hope to break\r\nthrough the barbed wire on such a rush. It looked as if they planned an\r\nIndian-style attack as the line began breaking in a slow curve something\r\nless than 100 yards away.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" Sykes commanded. Volleys of shots rang out on both sides almost\r\nsimultaneously. The lead rider of the nomads went down, his horse\r\ngalloping in riderless panic at the head of the line. The hard-riding\r\ncolumn paralleled the barrier for 200 yards, drawing the fire of\r\nadjacent guard posts before they broke and turned south again. It was,\r\nevidently, a test of the strength of the defenses.\r\n\r\n\"Every shot counts!\" Sykes cried out to his men. As the attackers rode\r\nout of effective range he sighted four riderless horses. Beside him, in\r\nthe barricade, one of his own men was hit and bleeding badly. A\r\ntourniquet was prepared until two men of the medical detail arrived with\r\nan improvised stretcher.\r\n\r\nSykes sat down and rested his head on his arms for a moment. The air was\r\nwell below freezing, but his face was bathed with sweat. How long? he\r\nasked himself silently. How long can it go on? First the comet, then\r\nthis. He roused at a sudden cry beside him.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming back,\" a man shouted. Sykes stood up and raised his\r\nfieldglasses to his eyes. From around the point a fresh group of riders\r\nwas pouring toward the town. At least three times as many as before.\r\n\r\nIn a flash, he understood their intent. \"They're going to come through!\"\r\nhe cried. \"They're going to come right through the barrier, no matter\r\nwhat it costs them!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15. _Battle_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hard-riding nomad cavalry bore down on the defense line. They did\r\nnot break into a circling column as before, but began forming an\r\nadvancing line. When they were 75 yards away, Sykes ordered his men to\r\nbegin firing.\r\n\r\nThe nomads were already shooting, and what their emissary had said was\r\ntrue: these men were expert shots, even from horseback. Sykes heard the\r\nbullets careening off the sloping face of the barricade. Two of his men\r\nwere down already.\r\n\r\nHe leveled his police pistol and fired steadily into the oncoming ranks.\r\nHe thought they were going to try to jump the fence this time, and he\r\nbraced for the shock. To his dismay, he now saw that a perfectly clear\r\nspace for their landing had been left between his own position and the\r\nadjacent barricade.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the line of attackers swerved to the left just a few feet from\r\nthe wire. The defending fire was furious, and for a moment Sykes thought\r\nthey were going to turn the line back. Then several of the nomads raised\r\ntheir arms and hurled dark, small objects toward the barrier. Sykes\r\nrecognized them even while they were in the air. Grenades.\r\n\r\nHe shouted to his men and they flattened behind the barricade. Six\r\nexplosions thundered almost simultaneously. Mud and rocks sprayed into\r\nthe air and fell back in a furious rain upon the defenders.\r\n\r\nCautiously, Sykes lifted himself from the ground and got a glimpse of\r\nthe scene once more. A hundred feet of barbed-wire fence had disappeared\r\nin a tangle of shattered posts and hanging coils. Through the opening,\r\nthe nomads poured over the barricades in the midst of Sykes' men.\r\nSmashing hoofs landed almost upon him but for his frantic rolling and\r\ntwisting out of their path. Gunfire was a continuous blasting wave.\r\nSykes thought he heard above it the sound of Johnson's voice roaring\r\ncommands to the retreating men.\r\n\r\nIt sounded like he was saying, \"Close up! Close up!\" but Sykes never\r\nknew for sure. An enormous explosion seemed to come from nowhere and\r\nthunder directly in front of him. The day darkened suddenly and he felt\r\nhimself losing all control of his own being. He wondered if a cloud had\r\ncrossed the sun, but almost at the same time he ceased to be concerned\r\nabout the question at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of the wounded came in slowly, borne by stretcher bearers on\r\nfoot who had literally dragged their charges through the lines of\r\ninvading horsemen. Ken directed their assignment to the hospital-houses.\r\nHe had always believed he could take a scene like this in his stride,\r\nbut now he felt he must keep moving constantly to keep from becoming\r\nviolently sick.\r\n\r\nOverhead, a pall of smoke surged again, blotting out, partly, the\r\ncomet's light. More houses had been fired by the invaders. The sound of\r\ncrackling flames mingled with the thunder of hoofs and the roll of rifle\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nSurely it wouldn't be possible, Ken thought, for such a charge to\r\nsucceed unless it were backed by strong infantry. He moved into one of\r\nthe houses and directed the placement of the severely wounded man\r\nbrought up now by the bearers. As they left, he looked down at the\r\nstained and bloody face. A nurse was already at work cutting away the\r\nmatted clothing from the wound.\r\n\r\nKen exclaimed loudly before he realized what he was saying. \"Mr. Harris!\r\nMr. Harris--you shouldn't have been out there!\"\r\n\r\nThe man opened his eyes slowly against the terrible pain. He smiled in\r\nrecognition. It was Mr. Harris, the principal of Mayfield High School;\r\nthe one Ken had attended. He was an old man--at least fifty--much too\r\nold to have been at the barricade with a rifle.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have been out there,\" Ken repeated. Mr. Harris seemed to\r\nhave difficulty in seeing him.\r\n\r\n\"Ken,\" he said slowly. \"It's Ken Maddox, isn't it? Everybody has to do\r\nsomething. It seemed like this was the best thing I could do. No school\r\nto teach. No school for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice wavered as he began to ramble. \"I guess that makes all the\r\nstudents happy. No school all winter long. I always dreamed of Mayfield\r\nbeing a school where they would be glad to come, whose opening in the\r\nfall would be welcomed and closing in the spring would be regretted. I\r\nnever got that far, I guess.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do a really bad job, did I, Ken? Mayfield is a pretty good\r\nschool, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mayfield is a swell school, Mr. Harris,\" said Ken. \"It'll be the best\r\nday ever when Mayfield opens up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes ... when school opens again,\" Mr. Harris said, and then he was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe nurse felt his pulse and regretfully drew the sheet up to cover his\r\nface. \"I'm sorry,\" she said to Ken.\r\n\r\nBlindly, he turned and went out to the porch. Mr. Harris, he thought,\r\nthe little bald-headed man they'd laughed at so often with schoolboy\r\ncruelty. He had wanted to make Mayfield a good school, so students would\r\nbe glad to attend.\r\n\r\nHe'd done that--almost. Mayfield _was_ a good school.\r\n\r\nKen looked at the rolling clouds of black smoke in the sky. The gunfire\r\nseemed less steady now. Suddenly he was running furiously and with all\r\nhis strength. He turned down Main Street and headed south. He ran until\r\nhe caught sight of the first nomad he had seen since the events in the\r\nMayor's Council chamber.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had stopped his horse, rearing high, while he hurled some kind\r\nof incendiary through the window of a house. It exploded inside and\r\nbillows of flame and smoke poured out. A heart-tight pain gripped Ken.\r\nHe looked wildly about and saw a fragment of brick lying beside a\r\ndemolished house nearby.\r\n\r\nHe snatched up the missile and wound up as if pitching one straight over\r\nthe corner of the plate. The horseman saw the motion of his arm and\r\ntried to whirl, but he was too late. The brickbat caught him at the side\r\nof the head and he dropped to the snow without a sound. Ken ran forward\r\nand caught up the nomad's rifle and ammunition belt. The horse had fled\r\nin panic.\r\n\r\nWithout a backward glance Ken raced on down the street toward the\r\ndwindling sound of battle. The invaders were retreating, streaming from\r\nall directions toward the break in the barrier, firing steadily as they\r\ncame. The defenders were trying to block the escape.\r\n\r\nKen dropped behind a barricade next to an older man he didn't know. He\r\nsearched for an opening and waited for a rider to cross his sights; then\r\nhe squeezed the trigger and the man fell. When he looked up again the\r\nlast of the invaders were gone. Only half of those who had come up to\r\nthe attack were leaving it.\r\n\r\nThe men around Ken slowly relaxed their terrible tension. From some\r\nlying prone there were cries of pain. Those who could stand did so and\r\nrevealed their drawn faces to one another.\r\n\r\nTeams of the medical group began moving again. A horse-drawn wagon was\r\nbrought up that had been fitted with boards across the sides so that two\r\nlayers of wounded men could be carried at once.\r\n\r\nKen heard sudden hoofbeats behind and turned. Sheriff Johnson rode up\r\nand surveyed the scene. His eye caught Ken's figure standing in the\r\nmidst of it, rifle in hand, the captured ammunition belt draped over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" White anger was on Johnson's face. \"You were ordered to stay out\r\nof the frontline!\" he thundered. \"Any other man would be court-martialed\r\nfor such disobedience. Get back where you belong and don't show your\r\nface in this area again. I'll jail you for the rest of the fighting if\r\nyou disobey again!\"\r\n\r\nHalf-ashamed, but half only, for his impulsive action, Ken turned and\r\nmoved down the street.\r\n\r\n\"Leave that gun here!\" the Sheriff commanded harshly.\r\n\r\nKen gave it to the nearest soldier. He took off the ammunition belt and\r\nhanded it over too, then resumed his course. He should not have done it,\r\nhe told himself, but he felt better for it. He felt he had paid a little\r\nof his debt to Mr. Harris.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the hospital center he told his father.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't a good thing,\" said Professor Maddox gently, \"but maybe it\r\nwas something that had to be done.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the day they continued to bring in the wounded and the dead.\r\nThere seemed to be an incredible number, but the invaders had suffered\r\nheavily, too. Half their force had been lost. A dozen fine horses had\r\nbeen captured, which were a considerable prize.\r\n\r\nThere was speculation as to why the nomads chose to attack in this\r\nmanner. They had done great damage, it was true, yet the attack had not\r\nhad a chance of being decisive in spite of their insane persistence.\r\n\r\nHilliard and Johnson held a staff meeting that afternoon while a sharp\r\nwatch was kept for further attack. They considered that they had done\r\nvery well so far. The chief worries were the grenades and incendiaries,\r\nwhich the nomads seemed to have in large quantity.\r\n\r\nToward evening, Johnson asked for two volunteers to go out as scouts to\r\ntry to reach the top of Lincoln's Peak, west of town, to spot the camp\r\nof the nomads and scout their activities. A pair of volunteers was\r\nchosen from the many who offered. On two of the best of the nomads'\r\nhorses, they made their way across the frozen plain and up the small\r\nravine leading to the ridge. Observers watched until they were out of\r\nsight in the ravine.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed the two would return by 6 o'clock. At 5 there was the\r\nfaint sound of gunfire from somewhere in the hills. The scouts did not\r\nreturn at the appointed time. They did not return at all.\r\n\r\nNight came, and word spread among the townspeople of the disappearance\r\nof the two scouts. Anxiety increased as it became apparent they were\r\nunder close surveillance by the enemy. Perhaps it was the intention of\r\nthe nomads to wear them down with a winter-long siege of attack after\r\nattack, until they no longer had the ability or strength to fight.\r\n\r\nHilliard and Johnson doubted this. The nomads were far less equipped for\r\nsuch a siege than Mayfield was.\r\n\r\nMaria continued to return to the radio shack in the evening to maintain\r\nthe schedule with the network. She reported the plight of Mayfield to\r\nthe other stations. From across the country came the fervent best wishes\r\nof those who heard her. Wishes were all they could offer.\r\n\r\nThe scientists were particularly anguished because they considered the\r\nMaddox-Larsen group among the most likely to crack the barrier that kept\r\nthem from conquest of the comet dust. \"Our prayers are with you,\" the\r\nPasadena group said.\r\n\r\nThey sent a new report and Maria typed it and showed it to Professor\r\nMaddox that evening. He scanned it and put the pages in his coat pocket\r\nas he glanced out the window toward College Hill.\r\n\r\n\"It seems like ages,\" he said. \"I wonder if we'll ever get back up\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThe next attack came well before dawn. Sheriff Johnson was among the\r\nfirst to be aware of it. The thunder of seemingly countless horses'\r\nhoofs was heard faintly out of the south and he put his glasses to his\r\neyes. The nomads were a black patch against the snow.\r\n\r\n\"How many horses have they got?\" he exclaimed to the patrolman beside\r\nhim. This was Ernest Parkin, one of his best officers.\r\n\r\n\"I'd say there must be at least a hundred of them,\" said Parkin in awe.\r\n\"They must have been gathering horses for weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feed,\" said Johnson, \"for themselves and the animals--they may be\r\nrabble and savages, but they've had genius of leadership.\"\r\n\r\nBehind shelter, they waited for the blow. All orders had already been\r\ngiven. Only the general alarm was sounded now. It had been expected that\r\nthe previous pattern of attack would be repeated. The defenders had been\r\nmoved back from the barbed wire. They fired slowly and methodically with\r\na splendidly efficient barrage as the nomads swung out of the night to\r\nblast with their grenades at the reconstructed fence.\r\n\r\nThe way opened and they plunged in, the defenders closing behind and\r\nretreating to the other side of their barricades.\r\n\r\nKen paced restlessly as he heard the shooting. \"I'm going up on the\r\nroof,\" he told his father. \"There can't be any objection to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess not. I'll call you when we need you.\"\r\n\r\nKen climbed the stairs of the 6-story building, which was the highest in\r\nMayfield. He came out on the frozen surface of the roof and looked into\r\nthe distance. The mounted invaders were circling like Indians about\r\nseveral blocks of houses, firing steadily at the defenders and hurling\r\nincendiaries at the houses.\r\n\r\nThen, as Ken turned his eyes to the northern end of the valley, he felt\r\nas if the whole world had suddenly fallen to pieces in the dim, morning\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOn foot, a vast host of the invaders moved toward the northern defenses\r\nof the town. Instantly, he understood their strategy. While their small\r\nparties of mounted attackers had pressed the southern defenses, giving\r\nthe impression they intended to make their major approach there, the\r\nbulk of their forces had marched entirely around Lincoln's Peak and come\r\nupon the northern boundary at night. That was why the peak had been so\r\nheavily guarded against the scouts.\r\n\r\nIt had been a march of over 40 miles to by-pass the valley. Now,\r\nhowever, the nomads were in a position to achieve their goal. The bulk\r\nof the town's defense was concentrated in the south. Little stood in the\r\nway of the horde advancing from the north.\r\n\r\nHis heart sickened as he saw them rip through the barbed-wire enclosure.\r\nThe poorly manned defense posts seemed almost non-existent. Only a\r\nscattering of shots was thrown at the invaders.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere, a warning siren sounded, the agreed-upon signal to\r\nindicate invasion in that sector. It was far too late for that, Ken\r\nthought. The horde was already in the streets, fanning out, dispersing\r\nin the deserted streets.\r\n\r\nKen started for the doorway leading from the roof. His responsibility to\r\nCollege Hill was gone now. Every man in the valley was fighting for his\r\nown life. If that battle were lost, College Hill would be only an empty\r\nsymbol, where ghosts were housed, as in Berkeley, as in Chicago, as in\r\na thousand centers of learning the world around.\r\n\r\nWith his hand on the latch of the door he paused at a new sound that\r\nbroke upon the air. An incredible barrage of firing was occurring along\r\nnorthern Main Street near 12th Avenue. He put the fieldglasses to his\r\neyes again and watched the scattering nomads seeking cover. Dozens of\r\nthem lay where they fell headlong in the streets.\r\n\r\nKen strained his eyes to see where the defense had come from. It was\r\ncentered in the houses and buildings that lined the streets, and on\r\ntheir rooftops. He could see the ant-sized outlines of figures on those\r\nroofs. For a moment he failed to understand. Then he felt a choking\r\nsensation in his throat.\r\n\r\nIn a desperate gamble, Johnson and Hilliard had anticipated this move\r\nand prepared for it as best they could. They had allowed the main body\r\nof the attackers to enter the town itself and had deployed the majority\r\nof their guns to ring them about, while offering only token defense on\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nThis was it. The battle would be fought here and now, in the streets of\r\nMayfield, and before the day was over it would be known whether the city\r\nwould continue its struggle to live or whether it would become another\r\nBerkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16. _Black Victory_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spearhead of the nomad infantry attack broke through between two\r\nlightly manned guard posts whose garrisons fled in retreat with a few\r\nineffective shots. The column came through in a widening wedge. As it\r\nmet more defenders it fell back, but it appeared to the nomads that the\r\nwhole defense line had crumbled or had been diverted to the south, as\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThey poured along Main Street in the faint dawnlight until they reached\r\n12th Avenue. There, they split and fanned along 12th, east and west. It\r\nwas their strategy, obviously, to occupy and seal off this large\r\nnorthern sector of the town, which amounted to one-quarter of its total\r\narea and cut across a large portion of the business section. They would\r\nsolidify their position here, destroy all opposition, then move to still\r\nanother sector until they were in command of the entire town.\r\n\r\nIt was a strategy that would work, unless everything Mayfield possessed\r\nwere thrown against it, Ken thought. He saw now why 12th Avenue had been\r\nchosen as the line of attack: the defenders were intrenched there and\r\nwere offering forceful opposition.\r\n\r\nHe looked for a moment to the south again. The defenses there were\r\nlight, yet the charge of the mounted nomads had to be contained or they\r\nwould drive all the way to the center of town, burning and killing as\r\nthey went. If they succeeded in joining with the infantry they would\r\nhave split Mayfield's defenses in two.\r\n\r\nJohnson had mounted his best men, using the captured nomad horses as\r\nwell as the town's own. Desperately, this small force was trying to\r\ncontain and exterminate the fierce-riding enemy. Picked sharpshooters\r\nhad been carefully stationed with the best rifles available. Although\r\nthe gunfire was not heavy, Ken could see Johnson's men were taking a\r\nheavy toll of the invader.\r\n\r\nIn the north, the lines of fixed battle had now been established. The\r\nnomads had drawn back to positions of cover in the empty houses facing\r\n12th. Their flanks were more mobile, fighting for advantage along\r\nstreets parallel to Main but some blocks away on either side, and\r\nextending all the way back to the point of breakthrough. While he\r\nsurveyed the scene from the roof, Ken watched the stealthy movement of\r\ndefenders moving behind the main line to try to surround the enemy. That\r\nwas the strategy of the defense, and the gamble on which their entire\r\nfate hung.\r\n\r\nIf they succeeded they would have the breach closed, leaving no retreat\r\nfor the surrounded invader.\r\n\r\nThe comet slowly appeared, illuminating the scene of battle as if it lay\r\nupon some other planet. The day was clear so far, but a band of stratus\r\nhung low over the western hills. It would probably be snowing by\r\nnightfall, Ken thought.\r\n\r\nThrough the glasses he recognized the leader of a small patrol that was\r\nmoving east on 18th Avenue. It was Tom Wiley, the barber. His men were\r\nmostly students from the college. They were trying to gain a house\r\nfarther up the block to provide a covering point from which a general\r\nadvance of the line on both sides of them could hinge. Tom could not\r\nsee that an opposing patrol had him under observation.\r\n\r\nHe led his men into the open to cross the street. Ken wanted to shout\r\nfor him to go back, but it was impossible to be heard at such distance.\r\nThe enemy patrol moved out slightly. They centered Tom and his men in a\r\nmurderous burst of rifle fire. The barber fell. Two of the others were\r\nhit, but they managed to reach cover with the rest of their companions.\r\n\r\nThe body of Tom Wiley lay motionless where it fell in the snow-covered\r\nstreet. Ken could see the sign, just a block away, that read, \"Wiley's\r\nBarber and Beauty Shop.\" From where Ken stood, the sign, which jutted\r\nout over the sidewalk, seemed to project just above the body of the\r\nfallen barber.\r\n\r\nKen hesitated in his resolve to go down there in the midst of the\r\nfighting. He thought of Johnson's words and Hilliard's orders. Would the\r\ndefense strategy succeed? The nomads were trained and toughened by their\r\nweeks of fight for survival, but Mayfield's men were only weakened by\r\ntheir strained effort to keep the town alive.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the encirclement a burst of smoke with a core of\r\norange flame at its center spurted upward from a house. This was\r\nfollowed by a second and a third and a fourth. Defending fighters ran\r\nfrom the rear of the burning houses to the row beyond. Behind the screen\r\nof billowing smoke the nomads crept forward to repeat their tactics and\r\nfire the houses where the defenders now had cover. It was obvious they\r\nrecognized the danger of encirclement by forces stronger than any they\r\nhad anticipated. They were making a desperate effort to straighten their\r\nlines parallel to the barbed wire, with their flanks and rear clear of\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\nKen watched the success of their second incendiary thrust. They could go\r\non indefinitely unless the defenders succeeded in flanking them. That\r\nwas being attempted now. The defenders moved under the cover of the\r\nsmokescreen to fire on the advancing nomads. The latter recognized their\r\ndanger and held to solid cover of houses adjacent to those they had\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nNorth of this bulge, however, another column was forming, and Ken saw in\r\nsudden horror that it was headed directly toward the warehouse! A house\r\nonly a half-block from the warehouse burst into flame.\r\n\r\nThere was a flurry of activity from the defenders as they, too,\r\nrecognized the fresh danger and brought up reinforcements before the\r\nthreatened warehouse.\r\n\r\nThis added resistance seemed to inflame the determination of the nomads.\r\nThey answered the increased fire sharply. Another incendiary ignited a\r\nwooden building a step nearer the warehouse. The defenders tried to\r\nflank the threatening column but the latter ran between a row of burning\r\nhouses along an alleyway, firing additional incendiaries as they went.\r\n\r\nThen sudden flame burst against the wooden walls of the old skating rink\r\nand licked with red fury along its painted surface. In moments the\r\nwarehouse was bathed on all sides in seething flame, and the nomad\r\ncolumn spread beyond it, unaware of the mortal damage they had done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKen turned away. He walked slowly and decisively down the stairs. He\r\ntold his father what had just happened. \"I'm going out there, Dad,\" he\r\nsaid. \"They're going to wipe us out, or destroy every chance we'll have\r\nto survive even if we drive them off. Half of our food supply is gone\r\nnow. What chance have we got even if we kill every nomad in the valley?\"\r\n\r\nKen's father turned to a closet and drew out a .30-06. From a hook he\r\ntook down a hunter's jacket. Its pockets were loaded with shells, and\r\nhe had an extra box he gave to Ken.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson left this here,\" he said. \"He intended it for our use if the\r\nnomads reached this far. I think maybe it had better be used before the\r\nmedical center needs defending.\"\r\n\r\nKen's eyes lighted with gratefulness. \"Thanks, Dad,\" he said. \"I'm glad\r\nyou're willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know if I'm willing or not. However, I think I agree with you\r\nthat there's nothing else to be done.\"\r\n\r\nKen ran from the building, clutching the solid, reassuring weight of the\r\nrifle in his hand. His coat pockets and the hunting jacket were weighted\r\nheavily with the supply of ammunition. There was a feeling of security\r\nin the weapon and the shells, but he knew it was a short-lived,\r\ndeceptive security.\r\n\r\nHe went to Eighth Street and turned north, which would bring him close\r\nto the burned warehouse. He could see the immense, rolling column of\r\nblack smoke and hear the bursting crackle of its flames. The whole town\r\ncould go, he thought, if the fire became hot enough. It would spread\r\nfrom building to building regardless of the snow cover. He glanced at\r\nthe sky and hoped the snow might soon resume.\r\n\r\nFrom the rooftop, it had seemed to Ken that the small units of the\r\ndefenders were almost leaderless, and there was lack of co-ordination\r\nbetween them. He came up in their rear ranks and confirmed this\r\nsuspicion. They seemed to be depending as best they could on unanimous\r\nand intuitive agreement about a course of action. What had happened to\r\ntheir sergeants and lieutenants, Ken did not know. Perhaps in their\r\nhaste of organization there never had been any.\r\n\r\nThere was top-level command, of course, as appointed by Sheriff Johnson\r\nfor the entire sector, but it did not extend to the lower levels in any\r\ndegree Ken could see.\r\n\r\nThe men paid no attention as Ken joined them. He knew a few of the dozen\r\nnearby, but they seemed to regard him as a total stranger. The shock of\r\nbattle was in their eyes, and they seemed wholly unaware of anything in\r\nthe world except the desperate necessity to find cover and to destroy\r\nthe invader.\r\n\r\nKen followed them into the shelter of a house flanking the\r\nstill-advancing incendiaries. He crouched at a window with an older man\r\nwhom he did not know and leveled his rifle through an opening. A pair of\r\nfigures appeared momentarily at the edge of the smoking cloud. The older\r\nman jerked his gun and fired frantically and ineffectively.\r\n\r\n\"Slow!\" Ken cried. \"Aim before you shoot!\"\r\n\r\nThe man glanced at him in a kind of daze. Ken sighted patiently and\r\ncarefully. The smoke cloud parted once again and he squeezed the\r\ntrigger. One of the figures dropped and the smoke cloud closed down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nKen's calmness seemed to penetrate his companion who leaned back for a\r\nmoment to wipe a shaking hand across his sweat-stained face.\r\n\r\n\"I've never done anything like this before,\" he murmured helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"None of us have,\" said Ken; \"but we've got to do it now. Watch it!\r\nWe're drawing their fire!\"\r\n\r\nBullets shattered the window casing above and beside them. Across the\r\nroom a man crumpled. Ken risked a glance through the window. \"We've got\r\nto get out!\" he exclaimed. \"They're going to rush the house!\"\r\n\r\nIt might have been possible to hold if he knew what cover and\r\nreinforcements they had in the adjacent houses, but as far as he could\r\ntell the small, 12-man patrol might be entirely alone in the area.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, it all seemed utterly hopeless without communication, without\r\nleadership--how could they hope to withstand?\r\n\r\n\"Let's go!\" he cried. The others seemed willing to follow him. As they\r\nwent through the back he saw that the next house had indeed been\r\noccupied, but they, too, were retreating, not knowing what strength was\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nA new line of defenders was moving up from halfway down the block. Ken\r\nheld back to shout to the other patrol and to those coming, \"Let's stand\r\nin the next street!\"\r\n\r\nThere were shouts of assent from down the line and they moved to the\r\nshelter of the empty houses.\r\n\r\nThey were close to the edge of town, near the barbed-wire barricade, and\r\nthe nomads would obviously make their biggest effort here to wipe out\r\nthe forces that threatened to close them off. His own group, Ken saw,\r\nwould also have to make their stand here or risk being pocketed by the\r\nuncoiling line of nomads.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let them get close enough to fire the buildings!\" he shouted down\r\nthe line. The word was passed along with agreement. They broke into\r\nsmall patrols and occupied the houses, Ken joining one that took over\r\nthe top floor of a 2-story house. This gave them the advantage of good\r\nobservation, but the added danger of difficult escape in case the house\r\nwas set on fire. Its walls were brick, however, and offered a good\r\nchance of being held.\r\n\r\nWithin minutes, the nomads had occupied the houses just abandoned. Ken\r\nfired rapidly and carefully as he saw them exposed momentarily in their\r\nmove to new positions. His marksmanship had a telling effect on the\r\nenemy, and encouraged his companions. As soon as the nomads had obtained\r\ncover however, it was a stalemate.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-morning already, and Ken wondered how it had grown so late.\r\nFor an hour or two they exchanged shots with the enemy. Twice, attempts\r\nwere made to hurl firebombs. Both were driven back.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, however, the nomads seemed in no mood to make further\r\nattack. They were waiting for darkness, Ken thought, and then they\r\nwould advance with their firebombs and grenades and have free choice of\r\nbattle setting. If that happened, Mayfield might be a huge inferno by\r\nmidnight. They had to seize the initiative from the invaders.\r\n\r\nHe called his companions and told them how it looked. They agreed. \"What\r\ncan we do?\" a tired, middle-aged man asked.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to take the initiative before they come at us again.\" Ken\r\nglanced at the sky. \"Within an hour it may be snowing hard. That will\r\nmake it more difficult to hit a target. When daylight is almost gone\r\nwe'll attack them instead of waiting for them to come after us. It can\r\nbe done if we hit hard and fast enough. We'll lose some men, but not as\r\nmany as if we wait and let them pick us off with their grenades and\r\nincendiaries as they feel like it.\"\r\n\r\nThe men considered it dubiously. \"We've got a better chance to hit them\r\nas they break from cover,\" someone suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Not after dark, and that's what they're waiting for. They'll burn our\r\nhouses and drive us back all night long if we give them the chance. We\r\nmust not give it to them!\"\r\n\r\nReluctant nods of agreement came from his group. \"The way you put it, I\r\nguess it's the only chance we've got,\" the former objector agreed.\r\n\r\n\"I'll talk with the other groups,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\nHe moved down the stairs and out the back door of the house. The space\r\nbetween the two houses was entirely open. He flung himself down and\r\ncrawled. Twice, he heard the whine of bullets above his head.\r\n\r\nAfter heated argument, the group in the next house agreed to the plan to\r\nrush the invaders. He moved on down the block, regretting his own lack\r\nof authority that made it necessary for him to have to plead for\r\nco-operation. He wondered what was happening in the rest of the town.\r\nThere had been gunfire all day, but it seemed incredible there had been\r\nno communication from any other sector or any evidence of command. No\r\none he talked to had any idea what had happened to their command. There\r\nhad been some in the beginning, but it had simply seemed to vanish.\r\nKen's pleading for co-operation in an attack was the nearest thing to\r\nleadership they had seen for hours.\r\n\r\nThe snow was swirling hard and the sun was almost beyond the hills, what\r\nlittle of it was visible in the clouds. It was getting as dark as he\r\ndared allow before giving the signal for attack, but there was one more\r\ngroup to contact. He debated and decided to go to them.\r\n\r\nThen, as he entered the rear of the house, he heard the cries of alarm\r\nfrom those houses he had been to. The invaders were breaking out for an\r\nincendiary attack.\r\n\r\nHe seized his gun and fired the signal for their own advance. He ran\r\ninto the street shouting for the others to follow. The nomads were\r\nconcentrating their fire charge at the other end of the row of houses,\r\nand there the defenders fell back without an attempt to advance.\r\n\r\nLike watching a wave turned back by a rocky shore, Ken saw his\r\ncompanions fleeing in disorderly retreat through the rear of the houses\r\nto the block beyond. A bullet whizzed by his head. He dropped to the\r\nground and crawled on his stomach to the safety of cover behind a brick\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay in the snow, unmoving. He could not hold back the\r\nsobbing despair that shook him. He had never before known what it was\r\nlike to be utterly alone. Mayfield was dying and taking away everything\r\nthat was his own personal world. He had listened to news of the\r\ndestruction of Chicago and of Berkeley without knowing what it really\r\nmeant. Now he knew.\r\n\r\nFor all he knew, the nomads might even now be in control of the major\r\npart of the town. He could not know what had happened to his father, to\r\nMaria, to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe crackling of flames in the next house aroused him. He crawled\r\ninside the brick house, which was still safe, for a moment of rest. He\r\nknew he should be fleeing with the others, but he had to rest.\r\n\r\nHe heard sporadic shooting. A few nomads were straggling after their\r\ncompanions at the other end of the street. It was too far to shoot.\r\nHowever, one nomad stopped and swung cautiously under the very windows\r\nof the burning house next door. Ken leveled his rifle and fired. The\r\nbullet caught the man in the shoulder and flung him violently against\r\nthe wall. Ken saw that he would be buried by the imminent, flaming\r\ncollapse of that wall.\r\n\r\nThe man saw it, too. He struggled frantically to move out of the way,\r\nbut he seemed injured beyond the power to get away.\r\n\r\nKen regarded him in a kind of stupor for a moment. The man out there was\r\nresponsible for all this, he thought, for the burning and for the\r\nkilling....\r\n\r\nHe swung his rifle over his shoulder and went out. Brands were falling\r\nupon the wounded enemy. Ken hoisted the man under the arms and dragged\r\nhim to the opposite side of the adjacent house. The nomad looked at Ken\r\nwith a strange fury in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy!\" he said painfully. \"You're the one who shot me?\"\r\n\r\nKen nodded.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be cut off. Well, it won't matter much anyway. By tomorrow your\r\ntown will be burned and dead. Soon, we'll all be dead.\"\r\n\r\nKen kneeled on the ground beside him, as if before some strange object\r\nfrom a foreign land. \"What were you?\" he asked. \"Before, I mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe man coughed heavily and blood covered his mouth and thick growth of\r\nbeard. The bullet must be in his lungs, Ken thought. He helped wipe away\r\nthe blood and brushed the man's mouth with a handful of snow.\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy,\" the nomad said again. \"I guess we're all crazy. You're\r\njust a kid, aren't you? You want to know what I was a million years ago,\r\nbefore all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Ken said.\r\n\r\nThe man attempted a smile. \"Gas station. Wasn't that a crazy thing? No\r\nneed of gas when all the cars quit. I owned one on the best little\r\ncorner in Marysvale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you with them?\" Ken nodded in the darkness toward the distant\r\nattackers.\r\n\r\nThe man glared, twisting with the pain. Then his glance softened. \"You'd\r\nhave done it, too. What else was there? I had a wife, two kids. No food\r\nwithin a hundred miles after we used what was in our own pantry and\r\nrobbed what we could from the supermarket downtown.\r\n\r\n\"We all got together and went after some. We got bigger as we went\r\nalong. We needed men who were good with rifles. We found some. We kept\r\ngoing. People who had food fought to keep it; we fought to take it.\r\nThat's the way it had to be.\r\n\r\n\"We heard about your town with its big hoard of food. We decided to get\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know you burned half of it this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. That's tough. That's tough all the way around. Don't look at me\r\nthat way, kid. You would have done the same. We're all the same as you,\r\nonly we didn't live where there was plenty of food on hand. We were all\r\ndecent guys before. Me, those guys out in the street that you knocked\r\noff. I guess you're decent, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's your family now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty miles down the valley, waiting with the rest of the women and\r\nchildren for us to bring them food.\"\r\n\r\nKen rose slowly to his feet. The man was bleeding heavily from the\r\nmouth. His words were growing muffled. \"What are you going to do?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Get on with what has to be done,\" said Ken wearily. He felt sure he\r\nmust be walking in a nightmare and in just a little while he would\r\nawaken. \"If there's a chance, I'll try to send somebody after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me!\" the nomad said with sudden fierceness. \"I'm done for.\r\nYou've finished me. If our outfit should be unlucky enough to lose, see\r\nmy wife and try to do something for my kids. Get some food to them. Tom\r\nDoyle's the name,\" the man said.\r\n\r\nA fit of coughing seized him again and blood poured from his mouth. His\r\neyes were closed when he lay back again. \"Tom Doyle's the name,\" his\r\nbloody lips murmured. \"Don't forget that, kid. Tom Doyle's Service,\r\ncorner of First and Green in Marysvale. We were all good guys once.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe snow was so heavy it seemed like a solid substance through which Ken\r\nwalked. In spite of it, row upon row of houses burned with a fury that\r\nlit the whole scene with a glow that was like the comet's own. Above\r\nthis, the blanket of black smoke lay as if ready to smother the valley\r\nas soon as the light was gone.\r\n\r\nKen didn't know for sure where he was going. A kind of aimlessness crept\r\nover him and there no longer seemed any rational objective toward which\r\nto move. He crept on from house to house in the direction his group had\r\ngone, but he could not find any of them. Somewhere he touched the edge\r\nof combat again. He had a nightmare of going into a thousand houses,\r\nsmashing their windows out, thrusting his rifle through for a desperate\r\nshot at some fleeing enemy.\r\n\r\nThe night was held back by a hundred terrible fires. He shot at shadows\r\nand ghosts that moved against the flames. He sought the companionship of\r\nothers who fought, like himself, in a lonely vastness where only the\r\nsound of fire and gunshots prevailed.\r\n\r\nLater, he moved through the streets stricken with cold that he could not\r\nlose even when he passed and stood close to a mass of burning rubble.\r\nHe had stopped shooting quite a long time ago, and he guessed he was out\r\nof bullets. The next time he met someone, he thought, he would ask them\r\nto look in his pockets and see if any were left.\r\n\r\nHe kept walking. He passed streets where the black, charcoal arms of the\r\nskeletons of houses raised to the sky. He passed the hot columns of\r\nsmoke and continued to shiver with cold as they steamed upward to the\r\nclouds. He passed others but no one spoke. After a while he threw his\r\ngun away because it was too heavy to carry and he was too tired to walk\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nThe falling snow was covering the ruins with a blanket of kind\r\nobscurity. Ken kneeled down and was surprised to observe that he wasn't\r\ncold any more. He lay full length in the whiteness, cradling his head on\r\nhis arms, and peace and stillness such as he had never known before\r\nclosed over him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed an eternity later that there was a voice capable of rousing\r\nhim, a familiar voice calling out in anguish, \"Ken, Ken--this is your\r\ndad.\"\r\n\r\nHe responded, although it was like answering in a dream. \"Take care of\r\nthem, Dad,\" he said. \"Don't let anything happen to them. A woman and two\r\nchildren. Tom Doyle's the name--don't forget that, Tom Doyle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17. _Balance of Nature_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lay between white sheets, and the stench of burning things was\r\neverywhere, in the air that he breathed, in the clean white covers that\r\nwere over him. His own flesh seemed to smell of it.\r\n\r\nHe was not quite sure if he were still in a world of dreams or if this\r\nwere real. It was a golden world; the snow-covered ground beyond the\r\nwindow was gilded with rich, yellow light. He remembered something about\r\nsuch light that was not pleasant. He had forgotten just what it was.\r\n\r\nMaria Larsen stood at the foot of his bed. She smiled as his eyes\r\nopened. \"Hello, Ken,\" she said. \"I've been waiting so long. I've been\r\nafraid you'd never wake up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Doyle,\" he said. \"Did you find Tom Doyle?\"\r\n\r\nMaria frowned. \"I don't know who you mean!\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't found his family yet?\" Ken cried, struggling to rise in the\r\nbed. \"Go and find them right now. I promised Tom Doyle I'd do it.\"\r\n\r\nMaria approached and pushed him gently back upon the pillow, drawing the\r\ncovers over him once more. \"Tell me about Tom Doyle,\" she said. \"You've\r\nnever told me who he is.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed utterly stupid for her not to know, but Ken patiently told\r\nher about Doyle's Service, the best little station in the world, at the\r\ncorner of First and Green. \"I told Tom I'd take care of them,\" he said.\r\n\"Now go and bring them here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ken,\" Maria said, \"all the nomads who escaped, and there weren't many,\r\nretreated around the south end of town and picked up the women and\r\nchildren they'd left there. They moved on south. That was 3 days ago.\r\nWe've no idea where they've gone.\"\r\n\r\nKen tried to rise again against her struggles to hold him down. \"They\r\ncouldn't have gone so far that a man on horseback couldn't find them!\r\nWhy won't you help me? I promised I'd see to it!\"\r\n\r\nHe lay back weakly, covering his face with his arm. \"Go and find Tom\r\nDoyle,\" he said. In detail he described where he had left the man. \"You\r\ndon't believe what I'm saying. Get Tom Doyle and he'll tell you it's the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't be there now. All the wounded, including the nomads, have\r\nbeen moved to homes where they are being cared for. The dead, both\r\ntheirs and ours, have been burned and their ashes buried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what I tell you!\" Ken implored.\r\n\r\nWith bewilderment and fear on her face, Maria stood back from the bed\r\nand looked at Ken's troubled face. Then quietly she stole from the room\r\nand shut the door behind her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had been overworking himself for weeks, Dr. Adams was saying, and had\r\nbeen living on a poor diet that would scarcely keep a medium-sized pup\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\"Then you had a shock, the kind of shock that shakes a man to his very\r\nroots. Now you're on your way up again.\"\r\n\r\nKen glanced about the room. It seemed normal now and there was only a\r\ngreat emptiness within him to replace the frantic urgency he\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n\"What you're trying to say, Doc, is that I went off my rocker for a\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Adams smiled. \"If you want to put it that way. However, you're fine\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nKen stared at the ceiling for a few moments. \"Will you still say so if I\r\nask again about Tom Doyle?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he found?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Maria actually tried to find him for you. I'm afraid your Tom Doyle\r\nwas among the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We killed a lot of them--and they killed a lot of our people.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it end?\" asked Ken. \"I remember the darkness and just wandering\r\naround the streets shooting, but I don't know what I hit or where I\r\nwent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way it ended,\" said Dr. Adams. \"House-to-house street\r\nfighting, and we won. Don't ask me how. You were in a sector that was\r\ncut off almost as soon as you entered it. Even where communication was\r\nmaintained things were nearly as chaotic.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson says it was just plain, dumb luck. Hilliard says he doesn't\r\nthink it really happened. Dr. Aylesworth calls it a miracle, a gift and\r\na blessing that shows we're meant to survive. Most of the rest of us are\r\nwilling to look at it his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could do something for Tom Doyle,\" Ken said finally. \"He was a decent\r\nguy. They all were, once. I could find his wife and children.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. \"All who are left of that group of nomads are\r\ngoing to die. We've got to let them die, just as we let the people in\r\nChicago and Berkeley and ten thousand other towns die. We have no more\r\npower to save Tom Doyle's family than we had to save them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're taking care of the nomad wounded! We could do as much for just\r\none woman and two kids!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're helping the wounded until they get on their feet,\" Dr. Adams said\r\nquietly. \"Then they'll be sent on--to wherever they came from.\"\r\n\r\nKen stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing we could never forgive ourselves for,\" the\r\ndoctor continued. \"That one thing would be letting the Earth itself die.\r\nAs long as there are people alive who can fight the comet, we still have\r\na chance. Nothing else in the whole world matters now. Don't you see\r\nthere is no other purpose in keeping Mayfield alive except to support\r\nthe few people who understand the dust and can fight it? Beyond that,\r\nMayfield has no more right to live than any other town that has already\r\ndied. But Mayfield has to stay alive to keep you and your father and the\r\nothers like you fighting the dust.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Adams gave permission for Ken to be out of bed for a short time. He\r\ntried, after the doctor had left, and almost fell on his face. The whole\r\nworld seemed to spin in enormous cart wheels. He persisted though, and 2\r\nhours later he was making his way slowly up College Hill with the help\r\nof Maria who walked beside him and lent her arm for support.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hill they stopped and turned for a look at the valley\r\nbelow them. The ruin was plain to see in spite of the snow cover. A\r\nthird of the town had been completely burned. At the old skating rink,\r\nworkmen were clawing through the debris for usable remains of food. A\r\nmiserably small pile of items showed the extent of their success.\r\n\r\nCurls of smoke still rose from the ashes, and the nauseating smell of\r\ndeath and burning floated over the whole valley.\r\n\r\nOf his own experience Ken felt only a numbing confusion as yet. He\r\nthought he should feel like a fool for his collapse at the height of the\r\nbattle, but he did not. He felt as if he had marched to the absolute\r\nedge of human endurance and had looked to the dark pit below.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Maria. \"I'll be okay now. It's time for you to get back to\r\nthe radio station. Tell them what has happened and get their reports.\r\nI'll see you tonight.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long time since he had last been in the laboratory. The\r\nworkers were once more in the midst of their thousands of trials and\r\nfailures to produce a colloidal, non-poisonous form of the\r\ndecontaminant, which could be infused in the atmosphere of the world to\r\ndestroy the comet dust.\r\n\r\nHe stayed until his father left at 7 o'clock, and they went home\r\ntogether. He still had to depend on someone else for assistance on the\r\nsteep and slippery hill.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home Maria had a lengthy report ready from the\r\nPasadena people, and one from Schenectady.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox read the reports at the dinner table. He passed the\r\nsheets to Professor Larsen as he finished them. Ken saw he was not\r\nreading with his usual thorough analysis. When he had finished he\r\nreturned to his eating with perfunctory motions.\r\n\r\n\"Anything new?\" Ken asked.\r\n\r\n\"The same old story. A thousand hours of experiments, and no success. I\r\nfeel we're all on the wrong track, trying to perfect a chemical colloid,\r\nbased on the decontaminant, which will destroy the dust. I feel that\r\nnothing's going to come of it.\"\r\n\r\nKen said, \"I had a crazy dream the other day while Dr. Adams had me\r\nunder drugs. I had almost forgotten it. I dreamed I was walking along\r\nthe street and had a special kind of flashlight in my hand. When I came\r\nto a car that wouldn't run, standing by the curb, I turned the beam of\r\nthe flashlight on it. Then whoever owned it could step in and drive\r\naway. After I had done that to all the cars in Mayfield I turned it on\r\nthe sky and just kept flashing it back and forth and the comet dust\r\nfell down like ashes and the air was clean.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox smiled. \"A nice dream! I wish we could make it come\r\ntrue. I'm afraid that idea will have to go back to the pages of your\r\nscience fiction, where it probably came from in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad, I'm serious!\" Ken said earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"About making a magic flashlight?\" His father was almost sarcastic,\r\nwhich revealed the extent of his exhaustion, Ken thought. He was never\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is that there are other ways to precipitate\r\ncolloids. We haven't even given any thought to them. Colloids can be\r\nprecipitated by heat, by pressure, by vibration. Maybe a dozen other\r\nways that I don't know anything about.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe some kind of physical means, rather than chemical, is the answer\r\nto our problem. Why don't we let Pasadena and the other labs go on with\r\nthe chemical approach but let us do some work on possible physical\r\nmeans?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox sat very still. His glance passed from Ken to Professor\r\nLarsen. The latter nodded. \"I think we have indeed been foolish in\r\nignoring this possibility up to now. I wonder if Ken hasn't got a very\r\ngood thought there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you anything specific to suggest?\" Ken's father asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been wondering about supersonic methods. I know that a\r\nsupersonic beam can be used for coagulation and precipitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would depend on the size of the colloidal particles, and on the\r\nfrequency of the wave, wouldn't it? Perhaps we _could_ find a frequency\r\nthat would precipitate the dust, but I wonder if we wouldn't have the\r\nsame problem as with mechanical treatment of the Earth's atmosphere.\r\nEven if we succeeded on a laboratory scale, how could it be applied on a\r\npractical, worldwide scale?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Ken. \"It may not work out, but I think it's worth\r\ntrying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I agree. I don't think we'll give up the chemical research, but a\r\ngroup of you can begin work on this supersonic approach tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe losses of food at the warehouse were enormous. Less than 5 percent\r\nof the contents could be removed in usable form. Most of the canned\r\ngoods had burst from internal pressure. Grain and other dried products\r\nwere burned, for the most part. The food supply of the community was now\r\nreduced to six-tenths of what it had been.\r\n\r\nThe population had been reduced by one-tenth, in men killed by the\r\nnomads.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard and his councilmen struggled to work out a reasonable\r\nration plan, based upon the ratio of supplies to number of consumers.\r\nThere was no arithmetical magic by which they could stretch the food\r\nsupply to satisfy minimum needs until next harvest.\r\n\r\nThere was going to be death by starvation in Mayfield before spring.\r\n\r\nHilliard fought through an agreement in the Council that the researchers\r\non College Hill, and all their families, were to have first priority,\r\nand that they were to get full rations at all times in order to keep on\r\nwith their work.\r\n\r\nThere were grumblings among the councilmen, but they finally agreed to\r\nthe wisdom of this. They agreed there were babies and small children who\r\nneeded a somewhat normal ration, at least. There were over four hundred\r\nwounded who had to be cared for as a result of the battle. There were\r\nalso the aged, like Granny Wicks, and her companions.\r\n\r\n\"Well try to give the little ones a chance,\" said Mayor Hilliard, \"but\r\nthe old ones don't need it. Perhaps we can spare a little extra for the\r\nwounded who have a chance of survival, but not much. We're going to see\r\nthat College Hill survives.\"\r\n\r\nBefore spring, however, a choice would still have to be made--who was to\r\nhave the remaining share of food, and who was not?\r\n\r\nPrivately, Hilliard wondered if any of them had a chance to see another\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe decision to support the scientists at the expense of the other\r\ninhabitants of Mayfield could not be kept secret. When it became known,\r\na tide of fury swept the community. The general public no longer had any\r\ncapacity to accept the larger view in preference to relief of their own\r\nsuffering. One of the college students who worked in the laboratory was\r\nbeaten by a crowd as he walked through town. He died the same evening.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the scientists felt themselves standing apart, pariahs among\r\ntheir own people. They debated whether to take the allotment. They asked\r\nthemselves over and over if they were tempted to take it because they\r\nshared the same animal greed that gripped the whole town, or if genuine\r\naltruism prodded them to accept.\r\n\r\nDr. Adams met their arguments. \"You accept,\" he said, \"or everything we\r\nfought for is worthless. You can stand the hate of the townspeople.\r\nScientists have done it before, and it's a small sacrifice so long as\r\nyou can continue your work. Those of us who are supporting you believe\r\nin that work. Now get on with it, and let's not have any more of these\r\nridiculous arguments!\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of physical means of precipitating the dust came like a\r\nburst of light to the entire group as they began to examine the\r\npossibilities. Within a week, they had determined there was indeed a\r\nbroad range of supersonic frequencies capable of precipitating the dust.\r\n\r\nThe night Professor Maddox and his companions came home to announce\r\ntheir success they were met with the news that Mrs. Larsen was ill.\r\nDuring the day, she had developed a high temperature with severe pains\r\nin her body.\r\n\r\nProfessor Larsen was deeply worried. \"She's never been ill like this\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nKen was sent for Dr. Adams, but the latter did not come for almost 2\r\nhours. When he did arrive, they were shocked by his appearance. His face\r\nwas lined and hollow with exhaustion, beyond anything they had seen as\r\nlong as they had known him. He looked as if he were on the verge of\r\nillness himself.\r\n\r\nHe brushed away their personal questions and examined Mrs. Larsen,\r\nrather perfunctorily, they thought. However there was no hesitation as\r\nhe announced his diagnosis. \"It's the sixteenth case I've seen today.\r\nOver a hundred and fifty this week. We've got an epidemic of flu on our\r\nhands. It's no mild, patty-caking kind, either. It's as virulent as any\r\nthat's ever been experienced!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Maddox uttered a low cry of despair. \"How much more must we be\r\ncalled upon to endure?\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered. Dr. Adams rummaged in his bag. \"I have vaccine for all\r\nof you. I don't know how much good it will do against this brand of bug\r\nthat's loose now, but we can give it a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is everyone in town getting it?\" Professor Maddox asked.\r\n\r\nDr. Adams snorted. \"Do you think we keep supplies of everything in\r\nemergency proportions? College Hill gets it. Nobody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't go on taking from everyone else like this!\" protested Mrs.\r\nMaddox. \"They have as much right to it as we. There should be a lottery\r\nor something to determine who gets the vaccine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hilliard's orders,\" said Dr. Adams. \"Besides, we've settled all this.\r\nYou first, Ken.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few days after the battle with the nomads, it had seemed as if the\r\ncommon terror had welded all of Mayfield into an impregnable unit.\r\nThere was a sense of having stood against all that man and nature could\r\noffer, and of having won out against it. However, the penetrating\r\nreality of impending competition among themselves for the necessities of\r\nlife, for the very right to live, had begun to shatter the bonds that\r\nheld the townspeople as one.\r\n\r\nThe killing of the college student in protest against the partiality to\r\nCollege Hill was the first blast that ripped their unity. Some protested\r\nopenly against the viciousness of it, but most seemed beyond caring.\r\n\r\nThere were two events of note in the days following. The first was a\r\nspontaneous, almost valley-wide resurgence of memory of Granny Wicks and\r\nher warnings. Everything she had said had come true. The feeling swept\r\nMayfield that here in their very midst was an oracle of truth who had\r\nbeen almost wholly ignored. There was nothing they needed to know so\r\nmuch as the outcome of events with respect to themselves and to the town\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nAlmost overnight, streams of visitors began to pour toward the home for\r\nthe aged where Granny lived. When they came, she smiled knowingly and\r\ncontentedly, as if she had been expecting them, waiting for them.\r\nObligingly, and with the peaceful aura of omniscience, she took them\r\ninto her parlor and told them of things to come.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Frank Meggs felt new stirrings within him. He sensed\r\nthat he had been utterly and completely right in all his years of\r\ncriticism of those who managed the affairs of Mayfield. The present\r\ncondition of things proved it. The town was in utter chaos, its means of\r\nsurvival all but destroyed. Incompetently, its leaders bumbled along,\r\nnot caring for the mass of the people, bestowing the people's goods on\r\nthe leaders' favorites. He began saying these things on the streets. He\r\ngot a box, and used it for a platform, and he shouted from the street\r\ncorners that the leaders were corrupt, and none of them were safe\r\nunless College Hill and City Hall were wiped out. He said that he would\r\nbe a better mayor than anyone else in Mayfield.\r\n\r\nHe had listeners. They gathered on the corners in the daytime, and they\r\nlistened at night by the light of flaming torches. Many people began to\r\nbelieve that he was right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA week after Mrs. Larsen's illness, it was evident beyond all doubt that\r\nMayfield was the victim of a killer epidemic. Mayor Hilliard himself was\r\nstricken, and he sent word that he wanted Professor Maddox, Ken, and Dr.\r\nLarsen to come to his bedside.\r\n\r\nHe was like a feeble old man when they arrived. All the fire and the\r\nlife had gone from his eyes, but he brightened a little as they came\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\"At least you are still alive,\" he said gruffly. \"I just wanted to make\r\nsure of that fact, and I wanted to have a final understanding that it's\r\nsoaked into your thick heads that nothing is to interfere with your own\r\nsurvival.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hope you're not overestimating our worth,\" said Professor Maddox.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether I am or not! All I know is that if you're not\r\nworth saving then nobody is. So, if this town is going to die, you are\r\ngoing to be the last ones left alive, and if you don't give me your word\r\non this right now I'll come back and haunt you every minute you do\r\nsurvive!\"\r\n\r\n\"In order to haunt, you have to be in the proper realm,\" said Professor\r\nMaddox, attempting a joke.\r\n\r\nMayor Hilliard sighed. \"I think I can take care of that, too. I'm beat.\r\nYou're close to it, but you've got to hang on. Carry on with your work\r\non the hill. One thing more: This fellow Meggs has got to be crushed\r\nlike a worm. When I go, there won't be any election. Johnson is taking\r\nover and he'll look out for you, the same as I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to be all right!\" said Professor Maddox. \"You'll be up on\r\nyour feet in another week!\"\r\n\r\nThe Mayor seemed not to have heard him. He was staring at the ceiling,\r\nand there was an amused smile at the corners of his lips. \"Ain't Mother\r\nNature a funny old gal, though?\" he said. \"She's planned this to work\r\nout just right, and I think it's another of old Doc Aylesworth's signs\r\nthat Mayfield and College Hill are going to live, so that the rest of\r\nthe world will, too. It may get knocked pretty flat, but it's going to\r\nget up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"The invasion of the nomads, and then this flu. Don't you see it? First\r\nwe get our food supply knocked out, and now old Mamma Nature is going to\r\ncut the population down to match it. We tried to figure out who was\r\ngoing to eat and who was going to starve, and now it's going to be all\r\nfigured out for us.\r\n\r\n\"Balance of nature, or something, you scientists call it, don't you?\" He\r\nglanced up at the professors and Ken. \"It's a wonderful thing,\" he said,\r\n\"just absolutely wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18. _Witchcraft_\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later, Mayor Hilliard died. It was on the same day that\r\nMaria's mother was buried.\r\n\r\nMaria had watched her mother day and night, losing strength and finally\r\nlapsing into a coma from which she never emerged.\r\n\r\nMaria and her father did their best to control their grief, to see it as\r\nonly another part of the immense reservoir of grief all about them. When\r\nthey were alone in their section of the house they gave way to the loss\r\nand the loneliness they felt.\r\n\r\nThere were no burial services. The deaths had mounted to at least a\r\nscore daily. No coffins were available. Each family dug its own shallow\r\ngraves in the frozen ground of the cemetery. Sheriff Johnson posted men\r\nto help, and to see that graves were at least deep enough to cover the\r\nbodies. Beyond this, nothing more could be done. Only Dr. Aylesworth\r\ncame daily to hold prayer services. It was little enough to do, but it\r\nwas all there was left for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the death of Mayor Hilliard became known, Sheriff Johnson called an\r\nimmediate session of the councilmen and announced himself as Hilliard's\r\nsuccessor. Visitors were invited, and Professor Maddox thought it of\r\nsufficient importance to attend.\r\n\r\nThe tension in the air was heavy as the group sat in thick coats in the\r\nunheated hall. Johnson spoke without preliminaries. \"There are some of\r\nyou who won't like this,\" he said. \"Our town charter calls for an\r\nemergency election in case of the Mayor's death, and some of you think\r\nwe should have one now.\r\n\r\n\"So do those out there.\" He waved a hand toward the window and the town\r\nbeyond. \"However, we're not going to have an election, and I'll tell you\r\nwhy. I know the man who would win it and you do, too. Frank Meggs.\r\n\r\n\"He hated Hilliard, he hates us, and he hates this town, and he'll do\r\neverything in his power to destroy it. Today he would win an election if\r\nit were held. He's used the discomfort of the people to stir them to a\r\nfrenzy against Hilliard's policy of protection for College Hill. He'll\r\nstir them up against anything that means a sacrifice of present safety\r\nfor long-range survival. Meggs is a dangerous man.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe this isn't the way it ought to be done, but I don't know any\r\nother way. When this is all over there will be time enough for\r\nelections, and if I don't step down you can shoot me or run me out of\r\nthe country or anything else you like. For the time being, though, this\r\nis the way things are going to be. It's what Hilliard wanted, and I've\r\ngot his written word if any of you care to see it.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked about challengingly. There was a scuffling of feet. Some\r\ncouncilmen looked at their neighbors and back again to the Sheriff. None\r\nstood up to speak, nor did any of the visitors voice objections,\r\nalthough several of Frank Meggs' lieutenants were in the group.\r\n\r\n\"We'll carry on, then,\" Sheriff Johnson said, \"just as before. Food\r\nrations will remain as they are. We don't know how many of us there will\r\nbe after this epidemic is over. Maybe none of us will be here by\r\nspring; we can only wait and see.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough his assumption of power was accepted docilely by the Council,\r\nit sparked a furor among the populace of Mayfield. Frank Meggs fanned it\r\nwith all the strength of his hatred for the town and all it stood for.\r\n\r\nGranny Wicks' fortunetelling business continued to grow. Considerations\r\nhad been given to the desirability of putting a stop to it, but this\r\nwould have meant literally imprisoning her, and, it was reasoned, this\r\nwould stir up more fire than it would put out.\r\n\r\nHer glory was supreme as she sat in an old rocker in the cottage where\r\nshe lived. Lines of visitors waited all day at her door. Inside, she was\r\nwrapped in a blanket and wore an ancient shawl on her head against the\r\ncold of the faintly heated room. She cackled in her high-pitched voice\r\nwith hysterical glee.\r\n\r\nTo those who came, her words were solemn pronouncements of eternal\r\ntruth. To anyone else it would have been sheer mumbo jumbo, but her\r\nbelievers went away in ecstasy after carefully copying her words. They\r\nspent hours at home trying to read great meanings into her senile\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a time before Frank Meggs realized the power that lay in\r\nthe old woman, and he berated himself for not recognizing it earlier.\r\nWhen he finally did go to see her, he was not disappointed. It was easy\r\nto understand how she, with her ancient, wrinkled face and deep-black\r\neyes, could be confused with a source of prophecy and wisdom in these\r\ntimes of death and terror.\r\n\r\n\"I want to lead this people, Granny,\" he said, after she had bade him\r\nsit down. \"Tell me what to do.\"\r\n\r\nShe snorted and eyed him sharply. \"What makes you think you can lead\r\nthis people?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Because I see they have been led into disaster by selfish, ignorant\r\nfools,\" said Frank Meggs; \"men who believe that in the laboratories on\r\nthe hill there can be found a way to dispel the power of the great\r\ncomet. Because they believe this, they have persecuted the people. They\r\nhave taken their food and have given it to the scientists. They have\r\nprotected them, and them alone, from the disease that sickens us.\r\n\r\n\"You do not believe these men can overcome the power of the comet, do\r\nyou, Granny?\"\r\n\r\nWild flame leaped in the old woman's eyes. \"Nothing can overwhelm the\r\npower of this heavenly messenger! Death shall come to all who attempt\r\nsuch blasphemy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will give your blessing to my struggle to release the people\r\nfrom this bondage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Granny Wicks spoke with quivering intensity. \"You are the man I\r\nhave been waiting for. I can see it now! You are appointed by the stars\r\nthemselves!\r\n\r\n\"I prophesy that you shall succeed and drive out those who dare trifle\r\nwith the heavens. Go with my blessings, Frank Meggs, and do your great\r\nwork!\"\r\n\r\nElation filled him as he left the house. It was certain that Granny\r\nWicks would pass the word of his \"appointment\" to all who came to her\r\naudience chamber. The way things were going, it looked as if that would\r\nbe nine-tenths of the people in Mayfield.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the Mayor's chair by Sheriff Johnson gave Frank Meggs\r\na further opening that he wanted. The crowds grew at his torchlight\r\nharangues. Even though one-third of the population lay ill with the flu,\r\nthe night meetings went on.\r\n\r\n\"Sheriff Johnson has no right to the office he holds,\" he screamed. His\r\nappreciative audience huddled in their miserable coldness and howled\r\ntheir agreement.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the way things should be done. Our charter calls for an\r\nelection but when will there be an election? My friends, our good\r\nSheriff is not the real villain in this matter. He is but the tool and\r\nthe dupe of a clever and crafty group who, through him, are the real\r\nholders of power and privilege in this town.\r\n\r\n\"While we have starved, they have been fed in plenty; while we have been\r\ncold, they have sat before their warm fires; while we sicken and die of\r\ndisease, they are immune because the only supply of vaccine in this\r\nwhole valley was used by them.\r\n\r\n\"You know who I am talking about! The scientists who would like to rule\r\nus, like kings, from the top of College Hill!\r\n\r\n\"They tell us the comet is responsible for this trouble. But we know\r\ndifferent. Who has been responsible for all the trouble the world has\r\nknown for ages? Science and scientists! The world was once a clean,\r\ndecent place to live. They have all but destroyed it with their unholy\r\nexperiments and twistings of nature.\r\n\r\n\"They've always admitted their atom experiments would make monsters of\r\nfuture generations of men, but they didn't care about that! Now they're\r\nfrightened because they didn't know these experiments would also destroy\r\nthe machines on which they had forced us to be dependent. They try to\r\nsay it is the comet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the world would have been better off without their machines in\r\nthe first place. It would have been better off without them. Now we've\r\ngot a chance to be free of them at last! Are we going to endure their\r\ntyranny from College Hill any longer?\"\r\n\r\nNight after night, he repeated his words, and the crowds howled their\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOn College Hill, morale and optimism were at their highest peak since\r\nthe appearance of the comet. On the roof of Science Hall there was being\r\nerected a massive, 30-foot, hyperbolic reflector whose metal surface had\r\nbeen beaten out of aluminum chicken-shed roofs. At its center, and at\r\nintervals about the bowl, there projected a series of supersonic\r\ngenerating units, spaced for proper phasing with one another in beaming\r\na concentrated wave of supersonic energy skyward.\r\n\r\nPower to this unit was supplied by a motor generator set constructed of\r\ndecontaminated parts, which had been operating for a full week without\r\nsign of breakdown.\r\n\r\nKen and his companions had worked day and night on the rough\r\nconstruction, while the scientists had designed and built the critical\r\nsupersonic generating equipment. In a solid, 24-hour shift of\r\nuninterrupted work they had mounted and tested the units. It was\r\ncompleted on their second day of work. Tomorrow it would be turned on\r\nfor a full week's run to test the practicability of such a method of\r\nprecipitating the comet dust.\r\n\r\nLaboratory tests had shown it could be done on a small scale. This\r\nprojector was a pilot model to determine whether it would be worthwhile\r\nbuilding a full-size machine with a reflector 250 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nKen's father looked completely exhausted, but his smile was broader than\r\nit had been for many weeks. \"I'm confident we will prove the\r\npracticability of this machine,\" he said. \"After that, we will build a\r\nreally big one, and we'll tell the rest of the world how to do it. I\r\ndon't know how long it will take, but this will do the job. We'll get\r\nthem to build big ones in Tokyo and Pasadena and Stockholm, wherever\r\nthere's civilization enough to know how to do it; they can decontaminate\r\ntheir own metals and build new engines that will run as long as\r\nnecessary. We've got the comet on the run!\"\r\n\r\nHe hadn't meant to give a speech, but he couldn't help it. They were\r\nright, and their staggering labors were nearly over, in this phase, at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey slept from exhaustion that night. Ken was awakened in the\r\nearly-morning hours by the glare in his bedroom window. He sat up and\r\nlooked out. It seemed to be a very long time before he could let his\r\nmind admit what his eyes saw.\r\n\r\nScience Hall was in flames, the entire structure a mass of leaping,\r\nboiling fire.\r\n\r\nKen ran from his room, crying the alarm.\r\n\r\nIn their separate rooms, his father and Dr. Larsen stared stupidly at\r\nthe flickering light as if also unable to comprehend the vastness of the\r\nruin. In frenzy of haste, they donned their clothes and ran from their\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nMaria was awake as was Mrs. Maddox. \"What is it?\" they called. Then\r\nthey, too, saw the flames through the windows.\r\n\r\nThe men ran from the house, hatless, their tousled hair flying in the\r\nnight. Halfway up the hill, Ken called to his father, \"You've got to\r\nstop, Dad! Don't run like that!\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox came to a halt, his breath bursting from him in great\r\ngasps. Ken said, \"There's nothing we can do, Dad.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Larsen stopped beside them. \"Nothing except watch,\" he agreed.\r\n\r\nSlowly, they resumed their way. Behind, they heard the sounds of others\r\nattracted by the fire. As they came at last to the brow of the hill, Ken\r\npointed in astonishment. \"There's a crowd of people over there! Near the\r\nburning building!\"\r\n\r\nHe started forward. A shot burst in the night, and a bullet clipped the\r\ntree over his head. He dropped to the ground. \"Get down! They're firing\r\nat us!\"\r\n\r\nAs they lay prone, sickness crept through them simultaneously. \"I know\r\nwho it is,\" Ken cried. \"Frank Meggs. That crazy Frank Meggs! He's got a\r\nmob together and fired the college buildings!\"\r\n\r\nIn agony of spirit they crawled to the safety of the slope below the\r\nbrow of the hill. \"We've got to go after Sheriff Johnson,\" said Ken.\r\n\"We've got to fight again; we've got to fight all over again!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Larsen watched the fire in hypnotic fascination. \"All gone,\" he\r\nwhispered. \"Everything we've done; everything we've built. Our records,\r\nour notes. There's nothing left at all.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved down the hill, cautioning others about the mob. Sheriff\r\nJohnson was already starting up as they reached the bottom. Quickly,\r\nthey told him what they'd found at the top. \"We shouldn't let the mob\r\nget off the hill,\" said Ken. \"If we do, we'll never know which ones took\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are as many down here who would like to be up there,\" said\r\nJohnson. \"You can be sure of that. We don't know who we can trust any\r\nmore. Get your science club boys together and find as many patrolmen as\r\npossible. Ask each one to get fifteen men he thinks he can trust and\r\nmeet here an hour from now. If we can do it in that time we may stand a\r\nchance of corralling them. Otherwise, we'll never have a chance at\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can try,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\nBy now, others had been fired upon and driven back, so that the\r\nsituation was apparent to everyone. A great many townspeople, most of\r\nthose well enough to leave their houses, were streaming toward College\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nIt would be futile to try to find the patrolmen at their own homes, Ken\r\nknew. They'd be coming this way, too. He soon found Joe Walton and Al\r\nMiner. They mingled in the crowd, calling out for other members of the\r\nclub. Within minutes, all but two had been found. Word was passed to\r\nthem to carry out the Sheriff's instructions.\r\n\r\nIt was easier than they anticipated. Within 20 minutes a dozen officers\r\nhad been given the word to find their men. At the end of the hour they\r\nwere gathered and ready for the advance.\r\n\r\nThe spectators had been driven back. The armed men fanned out to cover\r\nthe entire hill in a slowly advancing line. They dwindled and became\r\nsilhouettes against the flames.\r\n\r\nAt the top, Sheriff Johnson called out to the mob through an improvised\r\nmegaphone. \"Give up your arms and come forward with your hands up!\" he\r\ncried. \"In 10 seconds we start shooting!\"\r\n\r\nHis command was answered by howls of derision. It was like the cries of\r\nmaniacs, and their drifted words sounded like, \"Kill the scientists!\"\r\n\r\nBullets accompanied the shouts and howls. The Sheriff's men took cover\r\nand began a slow and painful advance.\r\n\r\nThere could be a thousand mobbers on top of the hill, Ken thought. The\r\nSheriff's men might be outnumbered several times over. He wondered if\r\nthey ought to try to get reinforcements, and decided against it unless\r\nword should be sent down from the top.\r\n\r\nThere was no way of telling how the battle was going. Gunfire was\r\ncontinuous. A freezing wind had come up and swept over the length of the\r\nvalley and over those who waited and those who fought. It fanned the\r\nflames to volcanic fury.\r\n\r\nKen touched his father's arm. \"There's no use for you to stay in this\r\ncold,\" he said. \"You ought to go back to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to know how it comes out up there, who wins.\"\r\n\r\nThe cold starlight of the clear sky began to fade. As dawn approached,\r\nthe flames in the college buildings had burned themselves out. But the\r\ngunfire continued almost without letup. Then, almost as quickly as it\r\nhad started, it died.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, figures appeared on the brow of the hill and came down in\r\na weary procession. Sheriff Johnson led them. He stopped at the bottom\r\nof the hill.\r\n\r\n\"Was it Meggs?\" Ken asked. \"Did you get Frank Meggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"He fell in the first 10 minutes,\" said Johnson. \"It wasn't really\r\nMeggs keeping them going at all. They had a witch up there. As long as\r\nshe was alive nothing would stop them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granny Wicks! Was she up there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sitting on a kind of throne they'd made for her out of an old rocking\r\nchair. Right in the middle of the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she finally get shot?\"\r\n\r\nSheriff Johnson shook his head. \"She was a witch, a real, live witch.\r\nBullets wouldn't touch her. The west wall of Science Hall collapsed and\r\nburied her. That's when they gave up.\r\n\r\n\"So maybe you can say you won, after all,\" he said to Professor Maddox.\r\n\"It's a kind of symbol, anyway, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19. _Conquest of the Comet_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the coming of the comet, Ken sensed defeat in\r\nhis father. Professor Maddox seemed to believe at last that they were\r\npowerless before the invader out of space. He seemed like a runner who\r\nhas used his last reserve of strength to reach a goal on which his eye\r\nhas been fixed, only to discover the true goal is yet an immeasurable\r\ndistance ahead.\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox had believed with all his heart and mind that they had\r\nhurdled the last obstacle with the construction of the pilot projector.\r\nWith it gone, and all their tools and instruments and notes, there was\r\nsimply nothing.\r\n\r\nAs Ken considered the problem, it seemed to him the situation was not as\r\nbad as first appeared. The most important thing had not been lost. This\r\nwas the knowledge, locked in their own minds, of what means could\r\nprevail against the dust. Beyond this, the truly essential mechanical\r\nelements for starting over again were also available.\r\n\r\nArt Matthews had been very busy, and he had parts enough for six more\r\nmotor-generator sets. These were decontaminated and sealed in protective\r\npacking. It would be only a matter of hours to assemble one of them, and\r\nthat would power any supersonic projector they might choose to build.\r\n\r\nAnd they _could_ still choose to build one. In the radio supply stores\r\nof the town, and in the junk boxes of the members of the science club,\r\nthere were surely enough components to build several times over the\r\nnecessary number of generator elements. In the barns and chicken sheds\r\nof the valley there was plenty of aluminum sheeting to build reflectors.\r\n\r\nThe more he considered it, the more possible it seemed to take up from\r\nwhere they had left off the night before the fire. There was one\r\nimportant question Ken asked himself, however: Why stop with a replica\r\nof the small pilot model they had built on the roof of Science Hall?\r\n\r\nAs long as they were committed to building a projector to test for\r\neffectiveness, they might as well build a full-scale instrument, one\r\nthat could take its place as an actual weapon against the dust. If there\r\nwere errors of design, these could be changed during or after\r\nconstruction. He could see no reason at all for building a mere 30-foot\r\ninstrument again.\r\n\r\nThe greatest loss suffered in the fire was that of the chemistry\r\nlaboratory and its supplies and reagents. Materials for running tests on\r\nthe dust could not be replaced, nor could much of their microchemical\r\napparatus. The electron microscope, too, was gone. These losses would\r\nhave to be made up, where necessary, by having such work done by\r\nPasadena, Schenectady or Detroit. If the projector were as successful as\r\nall preliminary work indicated, there would be little need for further\r\ntesting except as a matter of routine check on the concentration of dust\r\nin the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBefore approaching his father, Ken talked it over with his fellow\r\nmembers of the science club. He wanted to be sure there was no loophole\r\nhe was overlooking.\r\n\r\n\"Labor to build the reflector is what we haven't got,\" said Joe Walton.\r\n\"It would take months, maybe a whole year, for us to set up only the\r\nframework for a 250-foot bowl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting the lumber alone would be a community project,\" said Al.\r\n\r\n\"That's what it's going to be,\" Ken answered. \"Johnson is behind us.\r\nHe'll give us anything we want, if he knows where to get it. I don't\r\nthink there's any question of his authorizing the construction by the\r\nmen here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else they could think of to stand in the way of the\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nIt had been two days since the fire, but Ken's father still seemed\r\nstunned by it. After dinner, he sat in his old chair where he used to\r\nread, but he did not read now. He sat for hours, staring at the opposite\r\ncorner of the room.\r\n\r\nProfessor Larsen seemed locked in a similar state of shock. In addition\r\nto his wife's death, this destruction of their entire scientific\r\nfacilities seemed a final blow from which he could not recover.\r\n\r\nKen recognized, too, that there was a burden these men had carried that\r\nno one else knew. That was the burden of top-level responsibility for a\r\nmajor portion of the world's effort against the \"invader.\" It was an\r\nAtlas-like burden that men could not carry without suffering its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nKen approached them that evening, after he and Maria had helped his\r\nmother with her chores and had gathered snow to melt overnight for their\r\nnext day's water supply.\r\n\r\n\"Dad,\" Ken said, \"I've been wondering when we could get started on the\r\nproject again. The fellows in the club are all ready to go. I guess most\r\neveryone else is, too.\"\r\n\r\nHis father looked as if Ken had just uttered something absolutely\r\nunintelligible. \"Start!\" he cried. \"Start what? How can we start\r\nanything? There's nothing left to work with, absolutely nothing!\"\r\n\r\nKen hesitated, an ache in his heart at the defeat he saw in his father's\r\neyes. He held out his hands. \"We've got these,\" he said. He tapped the\r\nside of his head. \"And this.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Maddox's face seemed to relax a trifle. He looked at his son\r\nwith a faint suggestion of a smile on his lips. \"Yes? What do you\r\npropose to do with them?\"\r\n\r\nCarefully, then, Ken outlined the results of his inventory. \"Art can\r\nbuild up to six engines, if we need them. We've got plenty of electronic\r\nparts, and tubes big enough to put 60 or 70 kilowatts of supersonic\r\nenergy in a beam. We don't want to build a little reflector again; we\r\nwant to put up a full-scale instrument. When that's done, build another\r\none, and still another, until we've used every scrap of material\r\navailable in the valley. By that time maybe we'll have some cars running\r\nand can go to Frederick and other towns for more parts.\"\r\n\r\nKen's father leaned back in his chair, his eyes closed. \"If enthusiasm\r\ncould do it, we could look forward to such a structure the day after\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe enthusiasm _can_ do it,\" said Professor Larsen quietly. \"I\r\nbelieve the boy is right. We've let ourselves despair too much because\r\nof the fire. We still have the necessary principles in our heads. If Ken\r\nis right, we've got the materials. The only problem is that you and I\r\nare a pair of old, exhausted men, without the necessary enthusiasm and\r\nenergy. Perhaps we can borrow enough of that from these boys. I'm in\r\nfavor of undertaking it!\"\r\n\r\nBy the light of oil lamps they planned and talked until far past\r\nmidnight. There were still no objections to be found outside the labor\r\nproblem. When they were through, rough drawings and calculations for the\r\nfirst projector were finished.\r\n\r\n\"Such a projector could surely reach well into the stratosphere,\" said\r\nProfessor Larsen. \"With the tremendous velocities of the air masses at\r\nthose heights, one projector should be able to process hundreds of tons\r\nof atmosphere per day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am wondering,\" said Professor Maddox, \"if we should not make the\r\nreflector parabolic instead of hyperbolic. We may disperse our energy\r\ntoo widely to be effective at high levels.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. The parabola would narrow the beam to little more than its\r\ninitial diameter and would concentrate the energy more than is required.\r\nWith the power Ken speaks of, I believe the hyperbolic form could carry\r\nan effective wave into the stratosphere. We'll make some calculations\r\nfor comparison tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey authorized Ken to speak with the Sheriff the following day.\r\n\r\n\"I've been wondering when I'd see some of you people,\" Johnson said\r\nbluntly. \"What are you doing about the mess on the hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father thought maybe you'd drop in,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff shook his head. \"It's your move. I just wondered if you had\r\nany ideas, or if this fire had knocked the props out from under you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It did, but now we're ready to go, and we need help.\" Briefly, Ken gave\r\na description of the projector they planned to build. \"Labor is the\r\nproblem for us. If we could have all the carpenters in town, and all who\r\ncould be spared from woodcutting and every other activity for 2 or 3\r\nweeks I think we could get it done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know how many men are left,\" said Johnson. \"Between the war with\r\nthe nomads and the epidemic of flu, one-third of those we had when this\r\nstarted are dead. A third of the ones left are sick, and quite a few of\r\nthose on their feet have to take care of the ones that aren't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Ken.\r\n\r\n\"You know how the people feel about you scientists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff stared at him a long time before continuing. \"It won't be\r\neasy, but we'll do it. When do you want to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow morning. In Jenkin's pasture, north of town.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many men?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the carpenters you can get and a hundred others to rustle materials\r\nand tear down old buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meet with the Council this afternoon to go over work assignments.\r\nYou'll have your men in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day, Ken and his fellow club members chose the exact\r\nspot to erect the projector and staked it out. They spotted the nearest\r\nbuildings that could be dismantled for materials, and made estimates of\r\nhow much they needed.\r\n\r\nThe following morning they met again on the site, and there were ten men\r\nfrom town, in addition to the college students and others who had taken\r\npart in the research on College Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all Johnson could spare?\" Ken asked the group.\r\n\r\nThe nearest man shook his head. \"They were assigned. No one else would\r\ncome. They think you are wasting your time; they think you can't do\r\nanything about the comet. A lot of them are like Meggs and Granny Wicks:\r\nthey think you shouldn't _try_ to do anything about it.\"\r\n\r\nKen felt a blaze of anger. \"Sometimes, I think they're right!\" he said\r\nbitterly. \"Maybe it would be better if we just let the whole thing go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't get me wrong,\" the man said. \"We're on your side. We're here,\r\naren't we? I'm just telling you what they say and think in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know and I'm sorry. These other fellows will tell you what we need\r\ndone. I'm going to ride in to see Johnson.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff was not in his office. Ken was told he had gone over to the\r\nfood warehouse where rations were being distributed. There was some\r\nrumor of a disturbance.\r\n\r\nKen remounted his horse and rode to the warehouse. As he approached, he\r\nsaw the lineup before the distribution counter was motionless. In front\r\nof the counter, Sheriff Johnson stood with a pair of revolvers in his\r\nhands, holding back the crowd.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Ken and said, \"Don't tell me! I know you haven't any\r\nworkers out there today. They're here in line, trying to collect\r\ngroceries without working!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not going to work so those scientists on the hill can have the\r\nfat of everything!\" a man near the head of the line shouted. Others\r\nechoed him with cries of hysteria.\r\n\r\nKen felt his disgust and disappointment vanish before a wave of genuine\r\nfear. These people had ceased to be anything but frightened, hungry\r\nanimals. Their capacity for rational action had all but disappeared\r\nunder the strains they had suffered. They were ready to lash out at\r\nanything that appeared a suitable target for their own hysterical anger\r\nand panic.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to expect them to help with the projector. The crew of\r\nscientists and students would have to do it alone, no matter how many\r\nweeks it took.\r\n\r\nSheriff Johnson, however, had no such thought. He fired a bullet over\r\nthe heads of the crowd and brought them to silence. \"Listen to me,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I know you're sick and hungry and scared. There's not a man or\r\nwoman in this valley who isn't, and that includes me and the members of\r\nthe Council, and those you tried to burn off College Hill.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know how good you've got it! You don't deserve it as good as\r\nyou've got. You people should have been with those in Chicago or in San\r\nFrancisco. You should have known what it was really like to be suddenly\r\ncut off from every ounce of food beyond that which was in your own\r\ncupboards. You should have known what it was like to fight day after day\r\nin the streets of a burning city without knowing why you were fighting,\r\nor having any hope of victory.\r\n\r\n\"You've gone through your battle, and you've won, and you're still here,\r\nand there's food left. A lot of us are still going to die before the\r\nepidemic is over. We haven't the medical means to save us all. But some\r\nof us will come out of it, and every one has just as good a chance as\r\nhis neighbor.\r\n\r\n\"That's not important. It doesn't make much difference whether any one\r\nof us stays alive now, or dies in 50 years. What is important is trying\r\nto keep the world alive, and that's what these scientists are doing.\r\n\r\n\"While you accuse them of every crime in the book, they are the only\r\nchance the world has got for survival!\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't do anything about it!\" a woman shouted. \"They're just making\r\nit up to get more than the rest of us!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd started to take up its cry again.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" the Sheriff thundered at them. \"I repeat: you don't deserve\r\nto be as lucky as you are! But you aren't going to get out of taking\r\nyour part in pulling things back together again. Help is needed out\r\nthere north of town, and you're going to help.\r\n\r\n\"You help or you don't eat!\"\r\n\r\nA roar of rage thundered from the group. One man stepped forward. \"You\r\ncan't pull a thing like this, Johnson. We've got guns, too. We've used\r\nthem before, and we can use them again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you had better go home and get them right now,\" said Johnson. \"My\r\nmen and I will be waiting for you. I suppose there could be a lot more\r\nof you than there are of us, so you can probably shoot us down. Then you\r\ncan eat all you want for a month, and die. Go get your gun, Hank, and\r\ncome after your rations!\"\r\n\r\nThe man turned to the crowd. \"Okay, you heard what he said! Let's go and\r\nget 'em!\"\r\n\r\nHe strode away, then turned back to beckon his followers. In the empty\r\nstreet before the converted theater, he stood alone. \"Come on!\" he\r\ncried. \"Who's coming with me?\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd avoided his eyes. They shifted uneasily and looked at Johnson\r\nagain. \"What do you mean?\" another man asked. \"About, we work or we\r\ndon't eat--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you guys!\" Hank shouted.\r\n\r\n\"The assignments on the projector will be rotated,\" said Johnson. \"We'll\r\nspare as many men as we can from everything else. Those of you who have\r\nbeen given assignment slips will get 3 days' rations. When you bring\r\nback the slips with a verification that you did your job on the\r\nprojector you'll get an assignment somewhere else until it's your turn\r\nagain. The ones without verification on the slips don't get the next 3\r\ndays' rations. That's the way it's going to be. If there's no more\r\nargument, we'll get on with the distribution.\r\n\r\n\"Hank, get down at the end of the line!\"\r\n\r\nBy mid-afternoon, the scientists had their full crew of sullen and\r\nunwilling helpers. The Sheriff had sent along a half-dozen of his own\r\nmen, fully armed, to see there was no disturbance, but the objectors\r\nseemed to have had their say.\r\n\r\nWith a gradual increase of co-operativeness, they did the tasks they\r\nwere assigned, bringing up materials, laying out the first members of\r\nthe great, skeletal structure that would rise in the pasture. Johnson\r\ncame at the end of the day to see how it was going. He breathed a sigh\r\nof relief at the lack of disturbance. \"It looks like we've got it made,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" Ken agreed. \"All we have to do now is see how many more of\r\nthese we can get built in other parts of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThey spoke that night to all the stations on the radio net, describing\r\nin detail what they had begun, what they were confident it would do.\r\nProfessor Larsen's words were relayed to his colleagues in Stockholm.\r\nThey estimated they could begin work almost immediately on six\r\nprojectors. Others, elsewhere in the country, were quite probable.\r\n\r\nIn his conversation with Pasadena, Professor Maddox warned, \"We have not\r\nyet been able to make tests with the big projector. Our only work so far\r\nhas been with the laboratory models, but they were highly successful.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good enough for us,\" said Dr. Whitehead, director of the\r\nPasadena work. \"Everything we've done here has failed so far. A direct\r\nchemical approach seems out of the question. We'll start with one, but I\r\nthink a dozen projectors, at least, are possible for this area.\"\r\n\r\nPasadena also reported a new radio contact with Calcutta, and promised\r\nto pass the word on to them and to Tokyo. When they closed down the\r\ntransmitter after midnight, Ken totaled the number of projectors\r\npromised with reasonable certainty of having the promises fulfilled.\r\nThere were eighty.\r\n\r\n\"It may take a year,\" his father said, \"or it may take 10 years, but now\r\nwe know, without a doubt, that we can someday get our atmosphere back as\r\nit was before the comet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20. _Reconstruction_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of January the comet reached its closest approach to\r\nEarth. It was then less than three million miles away. In the realm of\r\nthe stars, this was virtually a collision, and if the head of the comet\r\nhad been composed of anything more than highly rarefied gases it would\r\nhave caused tremendous upheavals and tidal waves.\r\n\r\nThere were none of these. Only the dust.\r\n\r\nKen arose at dawn that day and went into the yard to watch the rising of\r\nthe golden enemy a little before the sun came over the eastern hills. He\r\ndoubted whether anyone else was aware it was closer today than it had\r\nbeen before, or ever would be again. He doubted there would be much\r\nscientific interest in the event, anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the observatory, he opened the dome and adjusted the telescope to\r\ntake a few pictures and spectrograms. He remembered when he had done\r\nthis, a long time ago, with high excitement and curiosity, and he\r\nremembered later times when he had looked up with a bitter hate in his\r\nheart for the impersonal object in the sky.\r\n\r\nNow, he felt nothing. He was aware only of a kind of deadness in his\r\nemotions with respect to the comet.\r\n\r\nThere was no excitement he could find in today's event of close\r\napproach, which was probably the only one of its kind that would be\r\nrecorded in the history of mankind. He wondered if he had lost all his\r\nscientific spirit that so momentous an occurrence could inspire him so\r\nlittle now.\r\n\r\nYet, he no longer hated the comet, either. It was not a thing that could\r\nbe hated, any more than the wind when it leveled a city, or the waters\r\nwhen they drowned the land and the people on it.\r\n\r\nThese things were beyond hate. You could fight them, but you never had\r\nthe privilege of hating them. That was reserved only for other human\r\nbeings. It was because of the great, impersonal nature of their common\r\nenemy, he thought, that people had finally turned to fighting each\r\nother. It was for this reason that the people of Mayfield had turned\r\ntheir hate upon the scientists. The questions of food and privileges\r\nwere only superficial excuses.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's work, Ken left the observatory. The gassy tail of the\r\ncomet was a full halo of lighter yellow hue, as seen directly along its\r\ncentral axis. The darker yellow of the core seemed to Ken like a living\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe light spread to the dust motes in the air and curtained the whole\r\nsky with shimmering haze. It bathed the snow cover of the Earth, and\r\nreflected its golden image against the trees and the walls of the\r\nbuildings, and penetrated the windows. It gilded the stark, charcoal\r\nskeletons of the ruins it had created. It spread over the whole Earth\r\nand penetrated every pore. Ken had a momentary illusion that there was\r\nnot a particle of substance in the world not permeated and illumined by\r\nthe comet's light. He felt as if it were inside his own being, through\r\nhis vitals, and shining in the corridors of his brain.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the old hate returned. He wanted to shut his eyes against\r\nthat omnipresent light and to run with all his strength to some secret\r\nplace where it could never penetrate.\r\n\r\nHe recalled the words of Dr. Larsen that seemed to have been uttered so\r\nlong ago that they were scarcely within memory: \"The universe is a\r\nterrible place that barely tolerates living organisms. It is a great\r\nmiracle that here in this corner of the universe living things have\r\nfound a foothold. It does not pay ever to forget the fierceness of the\r\nhome in which we live.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no closing the eyes against this. He looked again at the\r\ncomet, the representative to Earthmen of all the fierceness and terror\r\nthat lay in outer space, beyond the thin tissue of atmosphere that\r\nprotected man and his fragile life. He would remember all the days of\r\nhis life that the universe might be beautiful and exciting and terrible,\r\nbut whatever it was, it held no friendliness toward man. It could\r\ndestroy him with a mere whim of chance occurrence. Man had gained a\r\nfoothold, but there was a long way to go to an enduring security.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the day of the official beginning of operation of the giant projector\r\nin Jenkin's pasture, there was a little ceremony. Sheriff Johnson stood\r\non an improvised platform and with an impressive gesture threw the\r\nswitch that officially turned the power into the great instrument. It\r\nhad been successfully tested previously, but now it was launched in an\r\noperation that would not cease until the last trace of comet dust had\r\nfallen from the sky and was mingled with the dust of the Earth.\r\n\r\nMost of the townspeople who were well enough to do so turned out for the\r\nceremony. During the construction, a guard had been kept to prevent\r\nsabotage of the projector, but there had been no attempts made on it.\r\nNow the people stood in the trampled snow and ice of the pasture,\r\nstaring up at the giant structure, with a quality of near-friendliness\r\nin their eyes and in the expressions of their faces.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff made a little speech after throwing the switch. He thanked\r\nthem for their co-operation and thousands of man-hours of labor, not\r\nmentioning that it had been obtained, initially, at the point of his\r\nguns. He praised the scientists and noted that conquest of the comet\r\nmight never have been achieved without the genius of their men of\r\nCollege Hill. He did not mention the attempts to destroy that genius.\r\n\r\n\"I think we should all like to hear,\" he said, \"from the man who has led\r\nthis vast and noble effort from its inception. He will speak for all\r\nthose who have worked so steadfastly to bring this effort to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. Professor Maddox!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a flurry of applause. Then it grew, and a shout went up. They\r\ncalled his name and cheered as he stood, a figure dwarfed against the\r\nbackground of the great projector bowl.\r\n\r\nKen knew what he must be thinking as he waited for the cheers to\r\nsubside. He must be thinking: they have forgotten already, forgotten the\r\nangers and the jealousies and the fears, their attempts to destroy the\r\nsmall kernel of scientific hope in their midst. They had forgotten\r\neverything but the warming belief that perhaps the worst of the terror\r\nwas over and they had lived through it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm grateful,\" Professor Maddox was saying, \"for the assistance you\r\nhave given this project, although you had no personal knowledge of what\r\nit was meant to do. We asked for your faith and we asked for your\r\nconfidence that we knew what we were about, at a time when we did not\r\nknow it even for ourselves. We were nourished and cared for at your\r\nexpense in order that our work might go on. It would not have succeeded\r\nwithout you.\"\r\n\r\nKen realized his father was not speaking ironically but meant just what\r\nhe said. And it was true.\r\n\r\nThe vengeful Meggs and the psychotic Granny Wicks had fought them and\r\nincited others who were frightened beyond reason. Yet there had been\r\nHilliard and Johnson, the Council, and many others who had supported\r\nthem. There were those who had built the projector, even though at the\r\npoint of a gun, and at the threat of starvation. All of them together\r\nhad made the project possible.\r\n\r\nIt was a miniature of the rise of the whole human race, Ken supposed.\r\nMore like a single individual with a multitude of psychoses, hopes, and\r\ngeniuses, than a group of separate entities, they had come to this\r\npoint. In the same way, they would go on, trying to destroy the\r\nweaknesses and multiply their strength.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February the flu epidemic was over. Its toll had\r\nleveled the population to a reasonable balance with the food supply.\r\nWhether Mayor Hilliard's ironic suggestion reflected any real principle\r\nor not, the situation had worked out in accord with his macabre\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nKen had explained the comet's daily infinitesimal retreat and there was\r\na kind of steady excitement in estimating how much it diminished each\r\nday. Actually, a week's decrease was too small for the naked eye to\r\ndetect, but this did not matter.\r\n\r\nRadio reports continued to tell of increased construction of projectors\r\nthroughout the world. Tests were showing they were effective beyond all\r\nprevious hopes.\r\n\r\nThe populace of Mayfield was enthusiastic about the construction of\r\nadditional units. Two more had been built, and three others were\r\nplanned. Serious attention had to be given now to the coming planting\r\nseason. Every square foot of available ground would have to be\r\ncultivated to try to build up stores for all possible emergencies of the\r\nfollowing winter.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for making the first work assignments on the farms,\r\nProfessor Maddox and Professor Larsen appeared to receive theirs.\r\nSheriff Johnson was in the office at the time. \"What are you two doing\r\nhere? You can get back to your regular business,\" he stormed. \"We aren't\r\nthat hard up for farmers!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no regular business,\" said Professor Maddox. \"The projector\r\nwork is being taken care of. Mayfield will probably not be the site of a\r\nuniversity again during our lifetimes. We want to be assigned some acres\r\nto plow. By the way, did you hear Art Matthews has got three more\r\ntractors in operation this week? If we can find enough gasoline we may\r\nbe able to do the whole season's plowing by machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure you want to do this?\" said Sheriff Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure. Just put our names down as plain dirt farmers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKen clung to the radio for reports of the outside world. The batteries\r\nwere all but exhausted, but a motor generator could be allotted to the\r\nstation as soon as other work was out of the way.\r\n\r\nIn Pasadena, they told him a diesel railway engine had been successfully\r\ndecontaminated and put into operation. Airtight packing boxes had been\r\ndesigned for the wheels to keep them from being freshly affected by the\r\ndust remaining in the air. It was planned to operate a train from the\r\nmetropolitan area to the great farming sections to the east and north. A\r\nfew essential manufactures had also been revived, mostly in the form of\r\nmachine shops to decontaminate engine parts.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were under way to try to move the great wheat and other\r\ngrain stocks of the Midwest down the Mississippi River to New Orleans\r\nand through the Panama Canal to the Pacific Coast cities. Oldtime\r\nsailing vessels, rotting from years of disuse, were being rebuilt for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nKen found it hard to envision the Earth stirring with this much life\r\nafter the destruction that had passed over it. In the civilized areas,\r\nit was estimated that fully two-thirds of the population had perished.\r\nOnly in the most primitive areas had the comet's effect been lightly\r\nfelt. Yet, around the world, the cities were stirring again. Food for\r\nthe surviving was being found. The hates and the terrors were being put\r\naway and men were pulling together again to restore their civilization.\r\n\r\nMaria came to the radio shack to tell him dinner was ready. He invited\r\nher to join him for a moment. \"It may be possible for you and your\r\nfather to return to Sweden much sooner that we thought,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMaria shook her head. \"We aren't going back, now. We've talked about it\r\nand decided to stay. It's as Papa always said: Where so much happens to\r\nyou, that's the place you always call home. More has happened to us in a\r\nyear here than in a lifetime back there.\"\r\n\r\nKen laughed. \"That's a funny way to look at it, especially after the\r\nkind of things that have happened to you here. Maybe your father is\r\nright, at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"All our friends are here now,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"All I can say is that it's wonderful,\" Ken said with a rising surge of\r\nhappiness in him. \"I mean,\" he added in sudden confusion, \"I'm glad\r\nyou've decided this is the best place to live.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed the subject quickly. \"Dad's even talking of trying to start\r\nup a kind of college here again. We wouldn't have the buildings, of\r\ncourse, but it could be done in houses or somewhere else. He says he's\r\nbeen thinking a lot about it and considers it would be our greatest\r\nmistake to neglect the continuance of our education. So I guess you can\r\nfinish school right here.\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I think all the professors out there trying to be dirt\r\nfarmers just got tired after a couple of days of plowing and decided\r\nsomething would have to be done about _that_ situation!\"\r\n\r\nMaria laughed. \"Don't be too hard on them. Papa told me about the plan,\r\ntoo. He says Sheriff Johnson has agreed to guarantee their pay in food\r\nand other necessities. He's stepping down now, so there can be an\r\nelection, but he's demanding approval of that program before he leaves\r\noffice. I don't think they ought to let him go.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be re-elected,\" said Ken. \"He's on top of the heap now. I even\r\nheard old Hank Moss chewing out some guys in town for criticizing\r\nJohnson!\"\r\n\r\nKen closed down the transmitter and receiver for the night. Together, he\r\nand Maria walked to the house. They stopped on the back porch and\r\nglanced toward the distant projector bowls reflecting the light of the\r\ncomet and of the sun.\r\n\r\nSoon there would be only the sun to shine in the sky. The Earth was\r\nalive. Man was on his way up again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\n\r\nAt various times, Raymond F. Jones has lived in Utah, Nevada, Arizona,\r\nNew Mexico and Texas, thereby enabling him to describe the mountain-west\r\ncommunity, which is the scene of his newest science fiction book, with\r\nsureness and insight. He also has a rich scientific background, which\r\nincludes training in the fields of radio operating, and electronic\r\nengineering, followed by meteorological work with the United States\r\nWeather Bureau. To this kaleidoscope of places and things, Mr. Jones has\r\nadded another facet, that of \"a spare-time writer\" and has managed to\r\nproduce eight books, something over one hundred magazine stories,\r\narticles and novelettes. This is his third Winston book.\r\n\r\nThe author was born in Salt Lake City where he is presently living, and\r\nattended the University of Utah. He is now working as a researcher with\r\na historical society which possesses the world's largest collection of\r\nmicrofilm copies of ancient documents and records. These documents have\r\nbeen gathered from all parts of Europe and the United States, and Mr.\r\nJones is enjoying this new environment.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones describes the theme of THE YEAR WHEN STARDUST FELL in this\r\nway: \"It is the portrayal of the unending conflict between ignorance and\r\nsuperstition on one hand, and knowledge and cultural enlightenment on\r\nthe other as they come into conflict with each other during an\r\nunprecedented disaster brought on by the forces of nature.\"\r\n\r\nCoinciding with the surge of interest in all of science, this book will\r\ngive the reader a real appreciation of the role of the scientist.\r\n\r\nOther Winston Science Fiction Books\r\n\r\n    PLANET OF LIGHT\r\n    SON OF THE STARS\r\n\r\nOther Published Books\r\n\r\n    THE TOYMAKER RENAISSANCE\r\n    THIS ISLAND EARTH\r\n    THE ALIEN\r\n    THE SECRET PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Editors_\r\n\r\n\r\nCecile Matschat, editor of the Winston Science Fiction series, is\r\nrecognized as one of this country's most skilful writers and editors.\r\nShe has sixteen books to her credit, including the highly praised\r\n_Suwannee River_ in the \"Rivers of America\" series. Nationally known as\r\na lecturer, an artist of great ability, Cecile Matschat is also an\r\nexpert historian. With this varied background, she is perfectly suited\r\nto select top science fiction authors and books to make this a balanced\r\nand well-rounded series.\r\n\r\nCarl Carmer, consulting editor, holds an outstanding position in the\r\nliterary world.

JONES--A Mysterious\r\n\"Fall-Out\" Paralyzes Civilization\r\n\r\nMayfield was the typical college town. Nothing too unusual ever happened\r\nthere until a mysterious comet was suddenly observed by the scientists\r\non College Hill.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day the modified engine on Ken Maddox's car began\r\noverheating mysteriously. By morning it didn't run at all.\r\n\r\nArt's Garage, local headquarters for hot-rodders, was soon so full of\r\ncars that wouldn't run, that Ken's science club began working in the\r\ngarage after school. It didn't take long for the club to discover that\r\nall the moving parts on these stalled cars had fused together. Soon all\r\nmachinery had stopped in Mayfield. There was no longer any light or\r\npower anywhere. This mysterious creeping paralysis was spreading.\r\n\r\nThe copper-yellow glow of the comet seemed to have brought the whole\r\nworld to a grinding halt. Airplanes, trains, generators and heavy\r\nmachinery were immobilized. Finally man was left with only a few\r\nprimitive tools and communication became possible only by means of\r\namateur radio. In the resulting chaos parts of Mayfield were burned and\r\nlooted by hunger-crazed mobs that stole and killed as they advanced.\r\n\r\nHere is science fiction at its thrilling best. A startling and\r\nthought-provoking book that shows how human nature might react to\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Year When Stardust Fell, by Raymond F.
