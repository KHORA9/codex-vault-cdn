There clouds form, thunder and\r\nlightning also; it is the region of tempests and of whirlwinds; from\r\nthere fall rains, hail, and hoar frost; from there come all those\r\nphenomena, astonishing and often disastrous, which follow the combat\r\nof Nature with herself.... The sun's rays strike the earth on all\r\nsides, warming and strengthening it; they are reflected and detach\r\nall the particles they can carry away; vapours descend and rise again;\r\nthe winds come empty and return laden with spoil; animals breathe in\r\nfrom above this vital fluid which animates them, and the earth sends\r\nit back to its source as if she would fill the void by this means. So,\r\nby Nature acting everywhere and in all directions there results an\r\napparent discord from which is born the harmony of the Universe; it is\r\nthis general movement which puts all things in their places; some are\r\npreserved by the destruction of others; all move, all act, the\r\nstruggle is continual, if it ceased an instant everything would fall\r\ninto chaos....\"\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times, as far back as history extends, we find\r\nmankind interested in meteorological phenomena. This appears natural\r\nif we consider the importance of the weather to the ancient pastoral\r\nnations, which, from the open-air life and keen perceptive faculties\r\nof their people, were well fitted to study natural phenomena. The\r\nbeauty and grandeur of many of the phenomena occurring in the\r\natmosphere, and the curiosity excited concerning their causes,\r\nprobably contributed to interest people in them. Meteorology appears\r\nto have been first treated systematically, as distinct from astronomy\r\nand astrology, by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, more than 2000\r\nyears ago. The word \"meteor,\" derived from the Greek \"elevated,\" was\r\napplied to certain phenomena having their origin in the atmosphere.\r\nThese were classified into aÎrial, aqueous, and luminous meteors, and\r\nwere all included in the term Meteorology. In his treatise by this\r\nname Aristotle gave a more detailed account of them than any preceding\r\nor contemporary writer, and Theophrastus, his pupil, wrote two books\r\non the winds and on the signs of rain, which have been translated into\r\nLatin and English. About the same period Aratus incorporated the\r\ncurrent weather proverbs in his poem, _Diosemeia_. The Greek\r\nhistorians and poets frequently alluded to atmospheric phenomena, and\r\ntheir example was followed by the Romans, of whom Pliny has been\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the desire to ascend into the air always possessed man, but\r\nowing to the awe with which mountains seem to have inspired the\r\nancients, there is rarely mention in their writings of climbing\r\nmountains, or of the physiological effects which could hardly have\r\nfailed to be apparent upon high summits. Citing one of the few\r\nexisting narratives, Aristotle relates: \"Those which ascend to the top\r\nof the mountain Olympus could not keep themselves alive without\r\ncarrying with them wet sponges, by whose assistance they could respire\r\nin that air otherwise too thin for respiration.\" This mountain of\r\nless than 10,000 feet was said to be so high that it never rained on\r\nits summit, where, it was supposed, the air was always still. A still\r\nhigher mountain, easily accessible to the ancient world, and which we\r\nknow was ascended, is Etna.\r\n\r\nConcerning the progress of meteorology, from the time of the ancient\r\nRomans to the revival of knowledge in Europe, there is little to say\r\nexcept that during the middle ages meteorology, like other learning,\r\nwas confined to the monasteries. Speculations were current as to the\r\nextent of the atmosphere until, in the middle of the eleventh century,\r\nAlhazen, a learned Arab, computed from the duration of twilight that\r\nthe atmosphere extended nineteen leagues above the earth. The same\r\nmethod was applied with more precision by Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and\r\nother astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The\r\nearliest weather chronicles were probably noted by monks from time to\r\ntime in almanacks or missals, although when this was done first we do\r\nnot know. The oldest daily chronicles of the weather extant are those\r\nkept by William Merle in Oxford from 1337 to 1344. We owe it to the\r\nlate Mr. Symons, the English meteorologist and bibliophile, that this\r\nMS. and many other old records have been brought to light and\r\npublished. Dr. Hellmann has done even more in Germany, and this\r\nhistorical research is evidence of the growing importance of the\r\nscience of meteorology.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the age of geographical discovery it was seen that\r\nthe climatic features of our globe depend chiefly upon distance from\r\nthe equator, proximity to the ocean, and height above it. In the\r\ntropics especially, the luxuriant vegetation, which diminishes on\r\nmountain slopes and higher up gives place to snow, must have been\r\nvisible proof of the decrease of temperature with altitude, for, as\r\nProfessor Daniell remarked, mountains are a gigantic registering\r\nthermometer having for the freezing-point the line of perpetual snow.\r\nThe invention of instruments for measuring temperature and barometric\r\npressure made possible the quantitative observations that have\r\nsupplied the data for deducing the laws governing the atmosphere. The\r\noldest meteorological instrument is, no doubt, the weather or\r\nwind-vane, which had its origin before the Christian era. The next\r\noldest is the hygrometer, or instrument for measuring moisture in the\r\nair, the form which acts by absorption dating from the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, and the condensation hygrometer being a century\r\nyounger. Next in chronological order comes the rain-gauge, which\r\nappears to have been used by Castelli, a friend of Galileo, in the\r\nyear 1639. The history of that important instrument, the thermometer,\r\nis obscure, but it is certain that Galileo in Padua used an\r\nair-thermometer in the latter part of the sixteenth century, which\r\nRey, a French physician, filled with liquid in 1631. This thermometer,\r\nas well as other physical instruments, was perfected by members of the\r\nAccademia del Cimento at Florence. These instruments are described in\r\n_Saggi di Naturali Esperienza_, written in 1666, and translated into\r\nLatin and English. The Florentine thermometers had one fixed point,\r\nthat of freezing water, and contained either spirits or mercury. In\r\n1724 Fahrenheit, in Danzig, fixed three points on the scale of the\r\nmercurial thermometer, viz. the cold produced by ice and sal-ammoniac\r\nwhich he called 0∞, freezing water or 32∞, and the heat of the human\r\nblood which he assumed to be 96∞. This thermometric scale, having 180∞\r\nbetween freezing and boiling water, and that of Celsius, with 100∞,\r\nare the only ones in scientific use to-day. It is a remarkable fact in\r\nthe history of thermometers that neither of these thermometers\r\nremained in the country where it was invented; thus the thermometer of\r\nFahrenheit, a German, came into use exclusively in England and her\r\ncolonies, while that of Celsius, a Swede, is now used on the continent\r\nof Europe except in Germany, where the thermometer of RÈaumur, a\r\nFrenchman, is still in popular use. Of the four fundamental\r\nmeteorological instruments, the barometer was the last invented.\r\nAristotle had suspected that air had weight, but it was not\r\ndemonstrated until the middle of the seventeenth century, when the old\r\naxiom \"that Nature abhors a vacuum\" was replaced by the rational\r\nexplanation, given by Galileo and Torricelli, his pupil, why water\r\nwill not rise in a suction pump more than thirty-two feet. In 1643\r\nTorricelli executed this famous experiment: he took a glass tube,\r\nsealed at one end, and filled it with mercury, then, closing the open\r\nend with his finger, he inverted it in a basin of mercury. The mercury\r\nfell to about thirty inches, which was recognized to be the weight of\r\na column having the area of the tube and of the height of the\r\natmosphere. The application of the barometer was due to Blaise Pascal,\r\nwho repeated at Rouen Torricelli's experiment with a much longer tube\r\nfilled with water, which being thirteen times lighter than mercury,\r\nstood thirteen times higher, or thirty-two feet, in the tube. Pascal,\r\nbeing himself at Paris in 1648, got his brother-in-law Perier to carry\r\na barometric tube filled with mercury to the top of the Puy de DÙme, a\r\nmountain in Auvergne rising about 3500 feet above the city of\r\nClermont. The mercury fell in the tube with the ascent, and at the top\r\nof the mountain it stood some three inches lower than at the base,\r\nshowing that the lower layers of the atmosphere are denser than the\r\nupper. Pascal repeated the experiment on the Tower of St. Jacques in\r\nParis, and it is interesting to note that more than two hundred years\r\nafterwards, meteorological stations were established both there and on\r\nthe Puy de DÙme. It was soon perceived that not only did the level of\r\nthe mercury in the tube change with height, but that it oscillated\r\ncontinually at the same place, and from its observed relation to the\r\nstate of the weather its name \"weather-glass\" is derived. In 1650 the\r\nweight of the air was demonstrated in another manner by Otto von\r\nGuericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg, who by means of an air-pump of his\r\ninvention performed the experiment, which Aristotle had tried\r\nunsuccessfully, of weighing a vessel full of air and the same vessel\r\nexhausted of air. He also showed the pressure of the air in all\r\ndirections by the famous experiment of the Magdeburg hemispheres,\r\nwhich, being hollow, were placed together, and after the air was\r\nexhausted from the sphere so formed sixteen horses were unable to pull\r\nthem apart. Soon afterwards Robert Boyle experimented further upon the\r\nweight and \"spring of the air,\" as he called it, and gave the name to\r\nthe barometer. Both Boyle in England and Mariotte in France discovered\r\nthe law, bearing indifferently their names, that the pressure of gases\r\nis proportional to their density. Halley, a few years later, showed\r\nthat the rate of decrease in pressure differed from the rate of\r\nincrease in height, and developed formulÊ for measuring heights by the\r\nbarometer, which were afterwards perfected by Laplace. Knowing the\r\nheights of the barometer at a high and at a low-level station, and the\r\nmean temperature of the air lying between them, it is possible to\r\ncompute accurately the difference of height of the two stations, or,\r\nconversely, given this height, the difference in barometric pressure\r\ncan be calculated. By the middle of the seventeenth century the most\r\nimportant meteorological instruments had been invented, and not only\r\ncan Italy claim to be their birthplace, but the Grand Duke Ferdinand\r\nII., whose brother Leopold founded the Accademia del Cimento,\r\ndistributed the new instruments in Italy and even beyond the Alps, so\r\nthat in 1654 observations several times a day were begun at a dozen\r\nstations. The observations in Florence from 1650 to 1670 were\r\npreserved and constitute the commencement of instrumental meteorology.\r\n\r\nIt was the conquest of Peru which, by leading men over the high passes\r\nof the Andes, first brought them to great heights, but although we\r\nfind mention in the history of the expeditions of the so-called\r\nmountain sickness, caused by fatigue as well as by cold and rarefied\r\nair, it does not appear that scientific observations were made.\r\nTherefore, while it must be assumed that the atmospheric conditions at\r\nconsiderable altitudes were familiar to travellers, yet not until the\r\nmiddle of the last century did Bouguer, one of three French\r\nAcademicians sent to Peru on a geodetic mission, fix the height of the\r\nfreezing point in various latitudes, after observing that the\r\ntemperature fell below freezing at night upon the mountains near the\r\nequator. During the latter part of the century, Kirwan, an English\r\nchemist, calculated the temperature for various parallels of latitude,\r\nand in 1817 Alexander von Humboldt, after a voyage around the world,\r\npublished his isothermal lines, or lines of equal temperature on the\r\nsurface of the globe, by which he showed that the deviation from the\r\nnormal, or calculated, temperature arose from the distribution of land\r\nand water, and from the geographical relief of the former. This work\r\nof von Humboldt formed the basis of all subsequent studies in\r\ncomparative climatology. Meanwhile chemistry had kept pace with\r\nphysics, and in 1774 the old theory, that air was one of the four\r\nelements from which all things originated, was rendered untenable by\r\nPriestley, who proved that oxygen gas, which he discovered, was a\r\nconstituent part of air. The other constituent, nitrogen, formerly\r\ncalled azote from its destructiveness to life, was discovered soon\r\nafterwards, and its proportion in the air determined by the French\r\nchemist, Lavoisier.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 man became possessed of the long-sought-for means of rising\r\nfreely in the air, and he speedily availed himself of it. The first\r\nballoons, filled with heated air, were called _MontgolfiËres_ from the\r\ninventors, the brothers Montgolfier, living in Annonay, France. After\r\nanimals had been sent up attached to one, Pil‚tre de Rozier ventured\r\nto ascend in the aerostatic machine, first tethered captive but then\r\nset free, and before the close of the year a balloon, filled with\r\nhydrogen gas, or \"inflammable air\" as it was called, carried M.\r\nCharles 9000 feet above Paris. During more than a century the balloon\r\nhas been the most important agent for the exploration of the\r\natmosphere, and yet, notwithstanding the courage and devotion to\r\nscience of the early aeronauts, their ascents with unsuitable\r\ninstruments furnished much discordant and erroneous data. Some of the\r\nmost remarkable balloon voyages and the modern methods of sounding and\r\ndredging the atmosphere, to borrow terms from the exploration of the\r\nocean, will be described in two future chapters.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief reason for the slow progress of meteorology to the\r\nstatus of a science is the variable character of its phenomena with\r\nthe place of observation. In this respect it differs from astronomy,\r\nwhich was more easily cultivated in the restricted ancient world. Only\r\nafter many years of observation at different places had contributed a\r\nfoundation for climatology was it realized that man, in his relation\r\nto the atmosphere, resembled marine organisms confined to the bottom\r\nof the ocean, and that in order to discover the true conditions of the\r\natmosphere it was necessary to observe them at considerable heights.\r\nIn the last century the highest point at which physical observations\r\nhad been made was the summit of Mont Blanc, less than 16,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. The ascent of this mountain was first accomplished in\r\n1787 by H. B. De Saussure and his guides with much difficulty and\r\nsuffering, and the observations, abridged and rendered less accurate\r\nby the fatigue and sickness of De Saussure, were also influenced by\r\nthe proximity of the mountain itself. In 1802 von Humboldt and\r\nBonpland reached a height of about 18,000 feet in the Andes, where\r\nthey made important observations. The ascent of man was rapid during\r\nthe first years of the nineteenth century, for in 1804 Gay-Lussac rose\r\nin a balloon, without exertion or discomfort, to the height of 23,000\r\nfeet, and there made observations which were assumed to give the true\r\natmospheric conditions. After an active campaign the conquest of the\r\nair by balloons was temporarily abandoned, and the field was left free\r\nto the mountaineer. But to-day supremacy rests with the aeronaut, for\r\nno one has succeeded in getting higher than 24,000 feet on a mountain,\r\nwhile the aeronaut has exceeded this altitude by a mile without great\r\nhardship, and lately has sent his unmanned balloons twice as high as\r\nthe loftiest mountains.\r\n\r\nPlate I., headed The Exploration of the Atmosphere, represents a\r\nvertical section of the lower portion of our atmosphere. On the right\r\nis a scale of miles above the sea, and on the left is a scale of\r\nbarometric pressures corresponding to the height. The right-hand half\r\nof the diagram shows the eastern hemisphere with the Himalaya\r\nmountains, the left-hand half the western hemisphere with the Andes.\r\nThere are seen the heights of the different kinds of clouds, measured\r\nat Blue Hill, as described in the next chapter; the highest\r\nmeteorological stations, those on Mont Blanc and El Misti in Peru; the\r\nhighest permanently inhabited place, which is a monastery in Thibet;\r\nand the greatest height to which man has climbed, namely, in the\r\nAndes. The heights at which observations have been made in balloons,\r\ncarrying observers, or only recording instruments, may be compared\r\nwith the height attained by the Blue Hill kites, to be described\r\nhereafter. Other altitudes can be noted, such as the height of the\r\nsnow-line on various mountains, and as a thousand-foot measure, the\r\nEiffel Tower in Paris, the tallest structure erected by man, may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE I.--COMPARATIVE ALTITUDES.]\r\n\r\nThe development of meteorological knowledge to the commencement of the\r\npresent century has now been traced, but before beginning the\r\nconsideration of the methods of exploring the atmosphere that form the\r\nsubject of the book, let us, in order to understand this work better,\r\nreview the general knowledge which we possess of our atmosphere as\r\nregards its origin, composition, extent, and conditions of heat and\r\nmoisture. First, then, regarding the =Origin of the Atmosphere=, or\r\nvapour envelope which the name means. According to the nebular\r\nhypothesis of Laplace, our earth, like all existing suns and planets,\r\nwas condensed from clouds of nebulous matter and became a\r\nhighly-heated globular mass rotating, like every celestial body, from\r\nwest to east. As the earth cooled, a crust was formed, and many of the\r\nsubstances that now exist in the earth were suspended as clouds in the\r\ncooler atmosphere surrounding it. Eventually, these substances were\r\ncondensed upon the crust; the oxygen, especially, must have been\r\ndiminished by combining with the rocks, while the lighter gases, such\r\nas hydrogen, may have escaped from the earth's atmosphere. No doubt,\r\nwhen vegetable and animal life began, the earth's atmosphere was\r\ndenser than now and much richer in carbonic acid, which, during the\r\ncarboniferous period, was absorbed by plants, and is now imprisoned in\r\ncoal and limestone. Within historic times, however, there is no\r\nevidence of any change in the composition of our atmosphere, or the\r\nclimatic conditions as a whole.\r\n\r\nM. Jourdanet, a distinguished French physiologist, maintained that man\r\nappeared on the earth at the close of the tertiary period, when the\r\nbarometric pressure at sea-level was, he supposed, about forty-three\r\ninches, or nearly a half more than it is to-day, and owing to the\r\ngreater density of the air its temperature was also considerably\r\nhigher. Under these circumstances he believed that man first occupied\r\nthe high regions of Central Asia, and only emigrated to lower levels\r\nwhen the climatic conditions became ameliorated. In other words, M.\r\nJourdanet believed in a literal \"descent of man,\" but if this be true,\r\nmany of the race have returned to their birthplace, for to-day\r\nmillions of people dwell on the great Asiatic plateau, and on the\r\nSouth American Cordillera, at an average altitude of 10,000 feet,\r\nwhile a few live throughout the year at extreme heights of 15,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Atmosphere.=--Dry air is a mixture of about\r\none-fifth of a volume of oxygen to four-fifths of a volume of\r\nnitrogen, besides a very small quantity (3/10,000) of carbonic acid,\r\ntraces of ammonia, ozone, argon, and other recently discovered gases.\r\nThe oxygen consumed, and the carbonic acid given off by animal life\r\nand by combustion, are maintained in this fixed proportion in the free\r\nair by the absorption of the carbonic acid, and the setting free of\r\noxygen by vegetation. By diffusion and the mobility of the air, a\r\nthorough mixture is effected, with the result that the fundamental\r\ncomposition of our atmosphere is everywhere nearly the same. In the\r\nlower atmosphere the vapour of water is present in a varying quantity,\r\nin the average about one per cent. in weight, with a volume depending\r\non the temperature. Dust is always suspended in the atmosphere; the\r\ncoarser particles settle, but the finer ones, that come from\r\nvolcanoes, may float for a long time in the high atmosphere. Dust is\r\nan important factor in the production of clouds and rain, and\r\noccasions many optical phenomena.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE II.--OPTICAL PHENOMENA SHOWING THE HEIGHT\r\n   OF THE ATMOSPHERE. ]\r\n\r\n=Extent of the Atmosphere.=--If the atmosphere were incompressible and\r\nhad throughout the density that it has at the earth, its height would\r\nbe about five miles only, but actually it is composed of gases that\r\nfollow Boyle's law and vary in volume inversely as the pressure upon\r\nthem. Since the pressure decreases with height in a geometrical\r\nprogression, it would be halved for each three and a half miles of\r\nascent were the temperature constant, but as the temperature also\r\ndecreases with height, the successive intervals, beginning with three\r\nand a half miles, become shorter because the volume of a gas depends\r\non its temperature as well as on the pressure upon it. The decrease of\r\npressure with increasing height above the earth is shown by the\r\nleft-hand scale of Plate I., already described, and the subsequent\r\ndiminution of density to the limits of our measurable atmosphere is\r\nindicated on the right of Plate II., Optical Phenomena showing the\r\nHeight of the Atmosphere. The gases composing the atmosphere probably\r\nextend to heights proportional to their density; viz. oxygen to about\r\nthirty miles and nitrogen to thirty-five miles, although water-vapour\r\nnearly disappears at twelve miles. From these considerations it is\r\nsupposed that the atmosphere, as measurable by the barometer, vanishes\r\nat about thirty-eight miles, and this is about the height indicated by\r\ntwilight, which is the reflected light of the sun when 18∞ below the\r\nhorizon. After the great eruption of the volcano Krakatoa in the South\r\nSeas in 1883, the brilliant sunset glows and the longer twilight\r\nshowed that the dust emitted by the eruption remained for more than a\r\nyear suspended at a height of at least sixty miles. The so-called\r\n\"luminous clouds\" seen at night during the same period, and which were\r\nprobably these same dust particles still illumined by the sun, were\r\nfound by trigonometrical measurements to have about the same altitude.\r\nAlthough it is computed that at a height of seventy miles the air has\r\nless than one-millionth of its density at sea-level--which is about\r\nthe density of the air remaining in the exhausted bulb of an\r\nincandescent electric lamp--it is there sufficiently dense to render\r\nmeteors luminous by friction after they with great velocity enter our\r\natmosphere. The height of these meteors has been found, from\r\nsimultaneous trigonometrical measures at two stations, sometimes to\r\nexceed one hundred miles, and if we suppose the aurora borealis to be\r\nan electrical discharge in highly rarefied air, measures made in the\r\nsame way indicate as great a height for our atmosphere. The height of\r\nthe aurora varies enormously, but the average altitude of it and of\r\nthe other phenomena described, with the corresponding computed density\r\nof the air, are shown in the preceding diagram, in which the depth of\r\nthe ocean of air may be compared with the deepest seas and the highest\r\nmountains. While, as Professor Young says, it cannot be asserted that\r\nthe atmosphere has any defined upper limit, yet the kinetic theory of\r\ngases seems to afford evidence that the molecules of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen do not escape from the earth's attraction, and therefore the\r\nhypothesis of Professor Fˆrster is unwarranted, that interplanetary\r\nspace is filled with _Himmelsluft_, or very thin air.\r\n\r\n=Temperature of the Atmosphere.=--The warmth of the atmosphere is\r\nderived chiefly from the sun's rays which, arrested by the earth's\r\nsurface, are partly reflected and partly radiated back through the\r\natmosphere. Not more than seventy-five per cent.--Professor Langley\r\nsays only sixty per cent.--of the heat of the sun, which is received\r\nvertically on the upper surface of the atmosphere, penetrates to the\r\nearth, and very much less than this when the angle of the sun is low.\r\nThe reason why temperature diminishes as we ascend, is partly owing to\r\nthe greater loss of heat by radiation through the thinner envelope of\r\nthe upper strata, and partly owing to the greater absorption of the\r\nheat given off from the earth by the lower and denser strata. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that there is a diminution of 1∞ Fahrenheit\r\nfor each three hundred and thirty feet that we rise vertically, but,\r\nthis rate varies greatly at different heights, places, and times. For\r\ninstance, the decrease is not the same on mountains as it is in the\r\nfree air, and in the northern hemisphere it is greater on the south\r\nthan on the north sides of mountains; it is usually greatest near the\r\nground, and is faster in summer than in winter. But in the average,\r\nthe temperature falls as much for three hundred and thirty feet of\r\nelevation as it does for a change of seventy miles on the earth's\r\nsurface north or south of the equator. When dry air rises, because it\r\nis heated and thereby is made lighter, the laws of thermo-dynamics\r\nshow that, by reason of its expansion, its temperature is decreased 1∞\r\nFahrenheit for each one hundred and eighty-three feet that it ascends,\r\nand, by compression, its temperature is increased as much if it is\r\nmade to descend the same distance. This is called the \"adiabatic rate\r\nof change of temperature,\" because it is produced by an alteration in\r\nthe density of the air, due to variation in pressure, without the\r\naddition or loss of heat. In the course of this book there will be\r\noccasion frequently to refer to this law of heating and cooling. The\r\nadiabatic rate of change is seldom observed on mountains because of\r\ntheir influence upon the currents of air in contact with their flanks,\r\nor even in balloons, on account of imperfect measurements, but, as\r\nwill be explained in the closing chapter, the adiabatic change of\r\ntemperature is confirmed by the observations with kites, which furnish\r\nthe best method of obtaining the temperature of the free air up to\r\nmoderate heights. The adiabatic cooling of rising currents of air is\r\nanother reason for the rapid decrease of temperature with height up to\r\na mile or more. The upper air alters its temperature from diurnal and\r\nseasonal causes much more slowly than the lower air, and a mile above\r\nthe earth the daily change of temperature, apart from the passage of\r\n\"warm and cold waves,\" is less than one degree. At a height of six\r\nmiles above the earth a temperature much below zero constantly\r\nprevails, while, at ten miles, 80∞ below zero has been recorded in a\r\nballoon--this is approximately the temperature prevailing winter and\r\nsummer above pole and equator. These facts are expressed graphically\r\nin Plate III., Temperature at Different Latitudes and Altitudes,\r\nwhich represents half of a section of the earth, from the north pole\r\nto the equator, with the superincumbent atmosphere.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE III.--TEMPERATURE AT DIFFERENT LATITUDES\r\n   AND ALTITUDES.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it should be explained, that whereas the curvature of the\r\nearth with respect to the height of the atmosphere in the previous\r\ndiagram was not exaggerated, in the present diagram the height of the\r\natmosphere over the radius of the earth is enormously increased. At\r\nthe north pole the mean annual temperature is about 0∞ Fahrenheit, and\r\nat the equator it is about 80∞. It is seen that the atmospheric layer\r\nhaving a temperature of 50∞ (here represented in section by a line)\r\ntouches the earth at 45∞ latitude, but is about two miles above the\r\nequator. In the same way the line of freezing (32∞) leaves the earth's\r\nsurface at 58∞ latitude and rises to about three and a half miles over\r\nthe equator; the line of 0∞ rises from the pole to about seven miles\r\nat the equator. This is familiarly illustrated by the fact that only\r\nthe highest mountains in the tropics are snow-capped, while within the\r\nArctic circle the snow-line descends nearly to sea-level. The lines in\r\nthe diagram show the mean annual temperatures, but the isothermal\r\nsurfaces rise in summer and sink in winter, the change of altitude\r\nbeing greatest in northern regions and near the ground. Frequently\r\nthere is an inversion of temperature, that is to say, it is warmer\r\nabove than below. Notably, in Siberia, where the winter temperature is\r\n60∞ below zero, there can be no immediate decrease of temperature with\r\nheight, and it is probable that there is a warmer layer of air\r\ninterposed between the very cold earth and the still colder upper air,\r\nso that the temperature first rises rapidly with elevation and then\r\nfalls slowly to the limits of the atmosphere. In temperate latitudes\r\nit often happens, with a high barometric pressure, in winter that the\r\nmountain stations enjoy a long period of still and relatively warm\r\nweather, as compared to that experienced in the valleys. But the\r\nsubject of inversions of temperature will be discussed at length in\r\nconsidering the results of the balloon and kite observations.\r\n\r\nThe observations from balloons at great heights are neither\r\nsufficiently numerous nor accurate to enable us to form an opinion as\r\nto what is the temperature of interplanetary space, which the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases places at 460∞ Fahrenheit below zero. This temperature\r\nis called \"the absolute zero,\" and is calculated from the fact that\r\nair under a constant pressure contracts 1/490 of its volume for each\r\ndegree Fahrenheit it is cooled below the temperature of freezing\r\nwater, and consequently under no pressure it should have an infinite\r\nvolume and a temperature of about 490∞ below freezing, or 458∞ below\r\nzero. There are other hypotheses regarding the temperature of space,\r\nbut since it can never be measured directly, it will probably remain a\r\nmatter of speculation. It is certain, however, that if the earth were\r\ndeprived of its atmosphere, the temperature would fall very low, and\r\neven with our atmosphere as a blanket our earth would be\r\nuninhabitable were it not for the aqueous vapour which controls the\r\nselective absorption of the solar rays, transforming them into obscure\r\nrays so that they cannot escape from the atmosphere. Water-vapour,\r\nthen, is a very important factor in the physics of the atmosphere, but\r\nit can only be considered briefly here.\r\n\r\n=Moisture of the Atmosphere.=--The air is constantly absorbing\r\nmoisture from the water on the earth, but the tension of this aqueous\r\nvapour decreases with elevation much faster than does the atmospheric\r\npressure. At the height of about a mile and a quarter half the\r\nquantity of water-vapour is below, while we must rise about three and\r\na half miles to reduce the quantity of air one-half, as may be seen in\r\nPlate I. The relative humidity, or the percentage of moisture in the\r\nair, as compared to the amount which it could contain at that\r\ntemperature, is nearly the reverse at low and at high levels. It is\r\nfound from the kite-observations at Blue Hill, that up to the height\r\nof a mile or two the air is drier during winter and at night, and\r\ndamper during summer and in the day-time than it is near the ground.\r\nAt great heights probably the air is always very dry. The condensation\r\nof the invisible vapour into a visible form is considered in the next\r\nchapter on clouds.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that our observational knowledge of the atmosphere is\r\ngained by two general methods of exploring it, viz. observations made\r\nfrom the earth upon clouds and optical phenomena at a distance, and\r\nobservations made directly in the air itself. Although it was realized\r\nat the beginning of this century that meteorological observations were\r\nalmost all conducted at the very bottom of our atmosphere--\"in the\r\nshoals and shallows of the ocean of air,\" von Humboldt said--yet only\r\nwithin the past thirty years was it thought necessary to replace the\r\noccasional observations on mountains by systematic and long-continued\r\nones, comparable to those so generally carried on at low levels. It is\r\nan evidence of the zeal in America to advance the young science of\r\nmeteorology, that the first mountain-top station in the world was\r\nestablished in 1871 upon Mount Washington, and that both this exposed\r\npost of observation, 6300 feet above the sea, and the one more than\r\ntwice as high on Pike's Peak, which was for a long time the highest in\r\nthe world, were maintained for many years by the United States Signal\r\nService. The present highest station in the world is maintained by the\r\nHarvard Observatory upon El Misti in Peru, where, at a height\r\nexceeding 19,000 feet, a combination of self-recording instruments was\r\nconstructed by my assistant, Mr. Fergusson, to operate during three\r\nmonths without attention. It must be admitted, however, that the\r\naddition to our knowledge of the physics of the atmosphere afforded by\r\nthe American stations has been slight and incommensurate with the\r\nexpense incurred. More has been gained from the mountain stations in\r\nEurope, notably from those in the Austrian Alps, which have furnished\r\ndata for Dr. Hann's splendid discussions of the thermo-dynamics of the\r\natmosphere. While mountain stations present the only means of\r\nobtaining continuous observations at a considerable and constant\r\nheight, still they have serious drawbacks. Not only is the\r\ndistribution of mountains over our globe irregular, but since they\r\nform part of the earth's crust, terrestrial influences affect all\r\nobservations made upon them. In the case of plateaux this was at once\r\nadmitted, but by placing the stations on the summits of high and\r\nisolated peaks, it was hoped to approximate to the conditions of the\r\nfree air. It is now recognized that the equilibrium of the atmosphere\r\nis so delicate that for its dynamical study exact and minute\r\nmeasurements of temperature, moisture, and currents are required, and\r\nthe methods which will be described are intended to give the values of\r\nthese elements free from terrestrial disturbances.\r\n\r\nClouds, balloons, and kites naturally supplement one another. While\r\nclouds indicate the direction and velocity of the air at different\r\nheights, yet the lower clouds often conceal the upper strata, or there\r\nmay be no clouds at all, in which case balloons or kites will aid us\r\nto determine the drift of the currents. When there is little wind at\r\nthe ground, or to reach heights of several miles, we must employ\r\nballoons, but otherwise kites are preferable in most cases. The\r\nthermal and hygrometric conditions of the free air can be ascertained\r\nonly by personal observations in balloons, or by raising\r\nself-recording instruments with balloons and kites, and this latter\r\nmethod it is predicted will be the path of greatest progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n   CLOUDS--FORMATION AND CLASSIFICATION--MEASUREMENTS AT BLUE\r\n   HILL--THE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nClouds must have been among the earliest observed natural phenomena,\r\nand they were used from time immemorial as weather signs. Yet their\r\nevery-day occurrence was very likely the reason why their origin was\r\nnot studied until about a century ago. Father Cotte, in his classic\r\nwork on meteorology, published in 1774, devotes only a couple of\r\nparagraphs to clouds, but AbbÈ Richard, in his contemporary _Histoire\r\nNaturelle de l'Air_, discusses the appearance and theories of clouds\r\nin ten chapters. The cause of evaporation was unknown in the last\r\ncentury, and it was not until its close that Dalton, the English\r\nchemist, proved that water-vapour exists independently in the air, and\r\nHutton explained that precipitation was produced by the contact of a\r\ncurrent of saturated air with a colder one. Although there remains\r\nmuch to be learned about cloud formation, yet it is now pretty well\r\nestablished that its most effective cause is the ascent, and\r\nconsequent cooling by expansion of the air, rather than the mixture of\r\nmasses of air having different temperatures. The ascent of the air may\r\nresult from its being forced up a mountain slope by its horizontal\r\nmovement, or from its being drawn up in a vortex, but most commonly\r\nthe air rises from its lessened specific gravity when warmed. If the\r\ntemperature of the quiescent air decreases faster than 1∞ for each 183\r\nfeet of height, which is the adiabatic rate of cooling for dry air, as\r\nexplained in the last chapter, air warmed locally will rise and cool\r\nat this rate until the dew-point is reached. Then the vapour in the\r\nair will be condensed upon particles of dust, which Aitken found to be\r\nmore numerous in clouds than outside them. The most conspicuous of the\r\nclouds formed by rising currents is the cumulus, or rounded summer\r\ncloud, which has been aptly termed \"the visible capital of an\r\ninvisible column of air.\" Saturated air cools as it rises more slowly\r\nthan dry air, consequently the upward motion is maintained through the\r\ncloud mass, causing the swelling up of the tops of the cumulus clouds,\r\nwhich reach their highest development in the thunder clouds, or\r\ncumulo-nimbus, as they are called. The lower limit of the cloud region\r\nis determined therefore by the height at which the rising currents\r\nreach their dew-point, and the altitude of the cloud formation depends\r\nupon the humidity of the ascending current, the drier it is, so much\r\nthe higher must it rise to have its vapour condensed. In storms the\r\nrising current mingles with the stronger horizontal current above,\r\nwhich carries with it the upper portion of the cloud, and covers the\r\nwhole sky with a uniform sheet. The wave, or ripple cloud, has been\r\nexplained by von Helmholtz and von Bezold to be due to the undulations\r\nin a horizontal current producing alternate rarefaction and\r\ncondensation of its water-vapour through changes of temperature. Still\r\nanother cause of low-lying clouds is the cooling of the air to its\r\ndew-point by contact with a cold surface, such as the earth when\r\ncooled by radiation during a clear night, or the polar currents of the\r\nocean. Fog is often formed in this way, which we call stratus cloud\r\nwhen it rises above us. The highest clouds consist of ice crystals,\r\nbecause the temperature of the air where they are is much below that\r\nof freezing water. Although it is possible to cool drops of water\r\nconsiderably below 32∞ Fahrenheit without congelation, yet it can be\r\ntold with certainty that the clouds are composed of ice if the sun and\r\nmoon when seen through them are surrounded by the large rings or\r\nhalos, which the theory of optics shows can only result from\r\nrefraction of light by ice crystals, whereas water drops in the clouds\r\nproduce the smaller coloured rings, which are called coronÊ. The old\r\nquestion, why clouds float unless their particles are hollow, is\r\neasily answered, for they do not float, and always tend to sink if\r\nthey are not supported by the currents of air. In sinking into warmer\r\nair the particles are vapourized and become invisible, but others\r\nrising are condensed and take their places, so that the cloud\r\npersists, although its particles change. This is illustrated by the\r\n\"cloud banners,\" which frequently stream from mountain peaks, and are\r\ncaused by the rise of air up the mountain side. Even in a strong wind\r\nthe cloud remains attached to the peak, showing that its particles are\r\nbeing renewed continually; but if, as is often the case, the wind\r\ndescends on the leeward side of the mountain, the cloud particles\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nLamarck, the celebrated naturalist, in the opening year of the present\r\ncentury, first proposed a classification of cloud forms. Two years\r\nlater Luke Howard, a London merchant, published his epoch-making essay\r\non _The Modifications of Clouds_. The theories there advanced and the\r\nnomenclature proposed have been accepted generally to our day,\r\nnotwithstanding the more complete classifications devised by PoÎy,\r\nLey, and others. Howard believed that clouds are formed by the aqueous\r\nvapour which rises from the earth, and that the globules which compose\r\nthem are solid, and are not filled with hydrogen gas as had been\r\nmaintained by Deluc and De Saussure. Howard classified the clouds as\r\nwe do to-day, according to their appearance, into three principal\r\ntypes, viz. stratus, cumulus, and cirrus, which represented also low,\r\nmiddle, and high clouds. Stratus is the sheet of low-lying cloud which\r\nforms at night, and commonly rests on the earth; cumulus is the\r\nheaped-up cloud of the day-time; and cirrus is the curl cloud of the\r\nhigh atmosphere. These three types were further divided into four\r\nintermediate types, viz. nimbus, cumulo-stratus, cirro-stratus, and\r\ncirro-cumulus. Howard's nomenclature was used almost exclusively,\r\nuntil in 1889 the International Meteorological Conference that met at\r\nParis recommended the adoption of another classification, based on\r\nHoward's, but modified by two experts, Abercromby of England and\r\nHildebrandsson of Sweden. This classification also disregarded the\r\norigin of clouds, and was based only on their appearance. The next\r\nyear an atlas, with coloured pictures of the clouds, separated\r\naccording to the new nomenclature, with descriptive text, was prepared\r\nby Dr. Hildebrandsson, assisted by Drs. Neumayer and Kˆppen of the\r\nDeutsche Seewarte, or German National Meteorological Observatory. This\r\natlas was adopted by the principal meteorological institutions on the\r\ncontinent of Europe for their observers. The preface contained the\r\nfollowing statement: \"The study of the forms of clouds is daily\r\nincreasing in importance, both from the standpoints of theory and of\r\nweather prediction. Observations taken at the bottom of the\r\natmospheric ocean are plainly insufficient to determine its\r\ncirculation. The clouds, however, furnish information about the\r\ncondition and motion of the air at various levels. But, a comparison\r\nof the observations of different observers is only possible when the\r\nsame ideas are connected with the same expressions. It is hardly\r\npossible to give a sufficient verbal description of such indeterminate\r\nand changeable forms as those of the clouds; graphical representations\r\nare therefore necessary, with the help of a short description, in\r\norder to enable an observer to connect what he sees in the sky with\r\nwhat he finds in the instructions. In order that a cloud picture may\r\nbe intelligible to non-specialists, the clouds and the blue sky must,\r\nat least, be plainly distinguishable from each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the directors of the meteorological institutions in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, which was held at Munich in 1891,\r\ndecided to adopt the classification of Abercromby and Hildebrandsson,\r\nand a committee was appointed to prepare an Atlas of Clouds, which\r\nshould be cheaper than the preceding one. This committee, of which the\r\nwriter has the honour to be the American member, met at Upsala in\r\n1894. It defined the various forms of clouds, selected typical\r\npictures to illustrate them, and drew up instructions for observing.\r\nThis atlas, which was published in 1896, is the recognized authority\r\non cloud forms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the United States Weather Bureau had issued a plate of\r\nclouds, printed in one colour, to familiarize its observers with the\r\nnew system. The Navy Department has also an interest in clouds, for\r\nseveral thousand seamen in various parts of the world send their\r\nspecial logs to the United States Hydrographic Office. The\r\nHydrographer, a few years ago, was Captain Sigsbee, who, long before\r\nhe became known to the public as commander of the ill-fated _Maine_,\r\nhad achieved scientific reputation from his investigations upon the\r\ndepths and the currents of the ocean. Captain Sigsbee desired to\r\nrender comparable the observations of clouds which were being made all\r\nover the world, and to this end he resolved to publish a coloured\r\natlas of the international cloud types which should be intelligible to\r\nseamen, and yet not too costly for his office to supply. After two\r\nyears of experimenting, during which the writer and his assistant, Mr.\r\nClayton, were frequently consulted, the _Illustrative Cloud Forms_,\r\nwith and without descriptive text, were issued in 1897 by the\r\nHydrographic Office, and in several respects this atlas is the best.\r\nStill, it is impossible for anything but a photograph from the cloud\r\nitself to show the extreme delicacy of certain forms. Perhaps it\r\nshould be explained, however, that as the blue sky and the white\r\nclouds act with almost equal actinic effect upon the sensitized plate,\r\nin order to obtain the proper contrast between sky and cloud it is\r\nnecessary either to polarize the light from the sky, or, as is most\r\ncommonly done, to separate the coloured rays by allowing them to pass\r\nthrough a yellow screen, and to fall upon autochromatic plates.\r\n\r\nBefore defining the ten principal types of cloud it should be\r\nexplained that two general classes of clouds are distinguished,\r\nseparate or globular masses, which are most frequently seen in dry\r\nweather, and forms which are widely extended or completely cover the\r\nsky, which are typical of wet weather. Both these classes of clouds\r\nare found at all heights.\r\n\r\n=Cirrus= are thin, fibrous, detached, and feather-like clouds formed\r\nof ice-crystals. They are the highest of all the clouds, and move\r\nwith the greatest velocity.\r\n\r\n=Cirro-stratus= form a thin whitish veil, more or less fibrous, which\r\noften produces halos around the sun and moon and other optical\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n=Cirro-cumulus= are flocks of small detached fleecy clouds, generally\r\nwhite and without shadows.\r\n\r\n=Alto-stratus= is a grey or bluish veil through which the sun and moon\r\nare faintly visible, occasionally giving rise to coronÊ. Its altitude\r\nis only about half that of Cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\n=Alto-cumulus= are flocks of larger, more or less rounded, white or\r\npartially shaded masses, often touching one another, and frequently\r\narranged in lines in one or more directions.\r\n\r\n=Strato-cumulus= are large globular masses or rolls of dark cloud,\r\nfrequently covering the whole sky, especially in winter.\r\n\r\n=Cumulus= are piled clouds with conical or hemispherical tops and flat\r\nbases. They are formed by rising currents of heated air, and are\r\ntherefore most common in summer and in tropical regions. When broken\r\nup by strong winds the detached portions are called Fracto-cumulus.\r\n\r\n=Cumulo-nimbus= is the massive thunder shower cloud rising in the form\r\nof mountains or turrets, and generally having above a screen of\r\nfibrous appearance (False Cirrus), and underneath a mass of cloud\r\nsimilar to Nimbus from which rain falls.\r\n\r\n=Nimbus= is a dense, dark sheet of ragged cloud from which continued\r\nrain or snow generally falls. Broken clouds underneath, forming the\r\nscud of the sailors, are called Fracto-nimbus.\r\n\r\n=Stratus= is a thin uniform layer of cloud at a very low level. When\r\nthe sheet is broken up into irregular shreds it is called\r\nFracto-stratus.\r\n\r\nHaving described the origin and appearance of the different clouds, an\r\naccount will now be given of the measurements made at Blue Hill\r\nObservatory and the information which they give about the circulation\r\nof the atmosphere. The work there was taken up in 1887 in consequence\r\nof the interest of the meteorologist, Mr. Clayton, in the study of\r\nclouds; his discussion of the cloud observations, published two years\r\nago with the Blue Hill observations, has been termed by far the most\r\nthorough study of the kind ever undertaken in America if not in the\r\nworld. Most of the conclusions which are stated popularly here have\r\ntheir scientific expression in his work.\r\n\r\nThe first investigation related to the amount of cloud at different\r\nhours of the day, and during the various seasons. It is customary to\r\nnote the degree of cloudiness on a scale of from 0, when there are no\r\nclouds, to 10, when the whole sky is covered. For twelve years the\r\namount of cloud at each hour of the day has been recorded at Blue\r\nHill. The personal observations have been supplemented during the\r\nday-time by an automatic instrument called a sunshine-recorder, for it\r\nhas been proved that the cloudiness is very nearly the inverse of the\r\nbright sunshine. Consequently, if, as is usual there, the sun shines\r\nforty-six per cent. of the time when it is above the horizon, the\r\ncloudiness is very nearly fifty-four per cent., which is the average\r\nfor the year. The instrument generally used for this purpose is a\r\nglass sphere which acts as a burning-glass, and chars a strip of\r\ncardboard placed concentrically around the lower part of the sphere.\r\nAs the sun moves, the image on the card moves in the opposite\r\ndirection over the card, burning a line as long as it shines, but\r\nleaving the card untouched when it is cloudy. In a similar way a\r\nrecord may be obtained on sensitized \"blue paper\" by allowing the\r\nsun's rays to enter a dark chamber containing the paper. The\r\nmaintenance of personal observations at each hour of the night is\r\narduous, and, therefore, during ten years an automatic instrument has\r\nbeen used at Blue Hill which deserves to be better known. It is called\r\nthe pole-star recorder, and was devised by Professor Pickering,\r\ndirector of the Harvard College Observatory. The instrument is very\r\nsimple, and consists of a telescopic camera focussed on Polaris. This\r\nstar is not at the north pole of the heavens but a little more than a\r\ndegree distant, and, consequently, it describes a small circle in the\r\nheavens during twenty-four hours. When the sky is clear around Polaris\r\nits trail upon the photographic plate is continuous, but when the sky\r\nis partly or entirely covered with clouds the trail is broken or\r\nobscured. Of course the plate is not exposed until after dark, and a\r\nshutter is closed by a clock before dawn. The only hourly records of\r\ncloudiness at night in the United States are obtained by this\r\ninstrument on Blue Hill and at Cambridge. It will be objected,\r\nperhaps, that the cloudiness derived from observations of the sun or\r\nthe pole-star is not the amount over the whole sky, but only that in\r\nthe region of the luminary. This is true, but it is found that the\r\naverage of the records for a month or a year agrees very closely with\r\nthe average of estimates of cloudiness over the whole sky during these\r\nperiods. The use of the pole-star is preferable to that of the sun,\r\nbecause in our latitude it gives values at a point about half-way\r\nbetween the horizon and the zenith; while since the sun travels at a\r\nvariable height across the sky, when its altitude is low the same mass\r\nof cloud may intercept more sunlight than when it shines vertically.\r\nFrom ten years' observations the following deductions have been made\r\nconcerning the variation in the amount of cloud at Blue Hill. For all\r\nthe months the diurnal amount of cloud is greatest about one o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, on account of the frequency of cumulus clouds near\r\nthe warmest part of the day, while the next greatest amount, due to\r\nthe frequency of stratus clouds, occurs near sunrise, or at the\r\ncoldest time of day. All over the world the least cloudiness is in the\r\nevening, when the sum of the combined effects of radiation and\r\ninsolation is least. The annual period in the cloudiness is complex,\r\nbecause the amount of cloud is connected with changes of humidity at\r\nmany different levels in the atmosphere, but in the northern\r\nhemisphere there is most cloud during the first half of the year and\r\nleast during the latter half, probably because the increasing warmth\r\nat the earth's surface produces increased ascending currents until\r\nsummer, while the chilling of the earth's surface in the autumn\r\nbecomes unfavourable for ascending currents. The distribution of cloud\r\nover the globe is intimately connected with the general atmospheric\r\ncirculation, being greater where there are rising currents and less\r\nwhere there are downward currents. The reason, naturally, is that as\r\ndescending air becomes warmer and therefore relatively drier, the\r\nclouds in it evaporate and disappear. A cloudy belt encircles the\r\nearth at the equator, and on either side are two belts of less cloud,\r\nbut in higher latitudes the cloudiness increases. If we could see our\r\nearth from outside its atmosphere, the light reflected from the upper\r\nsurfaces of the cloud-belts would probably make them appear bright.\r\nFrom the markings on a planet that are known to be caused by\r\ncondensation, a French meteorologist, M. Teisserenc de Bort, believes\r\nthat the circulation of its atmosphere can be inferred, for wherever\r\non the surface of the planet bright spots are seen, there the vapour\r\nof rising currents should be condensed. If this be true, there is a\r\nresemblance between Jupiter, as we see it, and the earth as it would\r\nappear from another planet, the bright bands being cloud surfaces, and\r\nthe dark patches glimpses of the surface of the planet beneath.\r\n\r\nObservations of the direction of motion, and apparent velocity of\r\nclouds at different heights, have been made at Blue Hill several times\r\na day since 1886. To measure the motion of clouds the nephoscope (Fig.\r\n1) is used. It consists of a horizontal circular mirror with a\r\nconcentric circle of azimuths and an eye-piece _C_, movable in a plane\r\n_BD_ at right angles to the mirror and also around it, through which\r\nthe image of the cloud is brought to the centre of the mirror _A_. It\r\ncan be proved by geometry that the motion of the cloud-image is\r\nproportional to the movement of the cloud itself, so by noting in what\r\ndirection and how far the image is displaced in a given time, we have\r\nthe true direction of motion of the cloud itself and also its relative\r\nvelocity, comparable with the velocity of all clouds having the same\r\nheight. If the height is known, then the relative velocity can be\r\neasily converted into absolute velocity, and thus the velocity of\r\ncurrents at different heights in the atmosphere is accurately\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Nephoscope at Blue Hill Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe height of clouds seems to have been measured trigonometrically\r\nfrom two stations as early as 1644 by Riccioli and Grimaldi, two\r\nJesuits of Bologna, but notwithstanding these measurements and some\r\nconclusions derived from observations on mountains, and in balloons,\r\nthe altitudes of the different clouds were not known with any accuracy\r\nuntil in 1884 Ekholm and Hagstrˆm made a series of trigonometrical\r\nmeasurements upon the different kinds of clouds at Upsala, Sweden.\r\nAbout the same time attempts were made at Kew Observatory to measure\r\nclouds by photography, and in 1885 probably the first trigonometrical\r\nmeasurements in America were made at Cambridge, Mass., by Professor W.\r\nM. Davis and Mr. A. McAdie. In 1890-91 the Swedish methods were\r\nemployed at Blue Hill by Messrs. Clayton and Fergusson of the\r\nObservatory staff, and until recently the measurements there and at\r\nUpsala comprised all that was known accurately about the heights and\r\nvelocities of the various species of clouds.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Cloud Theodolite at Blue Hill\r\n   Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe trigonometrical measurements at Blue Hill were made as follows: at\r\ntwo stations, one at the Observatory, the other at the base of the\r\nhill about a mile distant, two observers determined simultaneously the\r\nangular altitude and azimuth of some point on the cloud which was\r\nagreed upon by telephonic conversation. If, as is generally the case,\r\nthe lines of sight did not meet, the trigonometrical formulÊ gave the\r\nheight of a point midway between the crossing of these lines. Such was\r\nthe accuracy of these measurements that the probable error of the\r\ncalculated heights of the highest clouds is only a few hundred feet.\r\nSuccessive observations at the two stations of the position of the\r\ncloud enabled its velocity to be calculated, or, as already explained,\r\nthis may be got from the relative velocity measured at one station, if\r\nthe height of the cloud be known. Fig. 2 shows the theodolite on the\r\ntower of the Observatory. Five other methods of measuring clouds have\r\nbeen employed at Blue Hill: (1) The only method of finding the height\r\nof lofty and uniform cloud strata is by means of the light thrown on\r\nthem from below, and on Blue Hill the electrical illumination of the\r\nsurrounding towns is utilized. The angle which the centre of the\r\nillumination makes with the horizon is measured, and knowing the\r\ndistance of the town, the right-angled triangle may be solved. (2) An\r\naccurate method for low and uniform clouds is to send kites into them,\r\nas will be explained in the closing chapter. (3) When the clouds are\r\nlow enough to cast shadows on the ground, the angles of the cloud and\r\nsun as seen from the Observatory are measured, and with the distance\r\nof the shadow from the hill-top, ascertained by a map, this triangle\r\ncan be solved. The times of passage of the shadow over known points on\r\nthe landscape afford another means of calculating its velocity. (4) A\r\nmethod that was suggested by Espy, the pioneer American meteorologist,\r\nfor getting the altitude of the bases of clouds lying within a mile of\r\nthe earth, is to find the difference in temperature between the air\r\nand the dew-point at the ground, and to compute the height at which\r\nthis difference should disappear. When the temperature of the rising\r\ncurrents increases, as on warm days, and the level of the dew-point\r\nrises higher, the cloud can be seen to ascend, and, in fact, the\r\nmeasurements at Blue Hill show that the clouds of moderate altitude\r\nare highest during the warmest part of the day. (5) Finally, very low\r\nstratus or nimbus may be measured by noting the heights of their bases\r\non the sides of the hill.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\nThe identity of cloud-forms all over the world has been established,\r\nand as a result of the measurements at Blue Hill, the heights and\r\nspeed of all clouds observed there are known. The averages have been\r\nplotted in the five levels into which we separate the clouds in Plate\r\nIV., Heights and Velocities of Clouds, where ordinates represent\r\nheights and abscissÊ velocities, and, consequently, the distances of\r\nthe various forms of clouds above the horizontal base indicate their\r\nheights, and the distances from the left-hand vertical line their\r\nvelocities. For comparison, the velocity of the wind on Blue Hill, a\r\nfew hundred feet above the general level of the country, is\r\nrepresented. The mean height of the cirrus is about 29,000 feet, but\r\nthis cloud sometimes reaches 49,000 feet. The mean height of the\r\ncumulus is about a mile, but the tops of the cumulo-nimbus, or\r\nthunder-shower cloud, sometimes penetrate into the cirrus level.\r\nGenerally the base of the nimbus, or rain cloud, is only 2300 feet\r\nabove the ground, and it frequently sinks below the top of Blue Hill,\r\nwhich is only 630 feet above the sea. The poetic saying, that \"Earth\r\nwraps her garment closer about her in winter,\" has a scientific\r\nbasis, for the average height of all the clouds is greatest in summer\r\nand least in winter. But the reverse is true of their velocity, for\r\nthe entire atmosphere moves twice as fast in winter as it does in\r\nsummer, and at the lower levels the seasonal change is even greater.\r\nThe average velocity of cirriform clouds is ninety miles an hour in\r\nwinter, and sixty miles in summer, but occasionally in winter cirrus\r\nhave been found to have the enormous velocity of two hundred and\r\nthirty miles an hour. In the average, the velocity of the currents\r\nincreases, from the lowest to the highest clouds, at the rate of about\r\nthree miles an hour for each 1000 feet of height, but near the ground\r\nthe increase with height is faster. It has been found that the\r\nvelocity of the lower clouds is less than the velocity of the wind on\r\na mountain of the same height, which may, perhaps, be explained on the\r\nsupposition that the mountain acts like a dam to accelerate the flow\r\nof air over it. The measurements in Sweden showed that the middle and\r\nupper levels of clouds are higher than in America, but that they move\r\nless rapidly. This may be because the surfaces of equal temperature in\r\nthe air are higher in the United States than in Sweden, on account of\r\nthe direction of the upper currents, while the greater velocity of our\r\nhigh clouds corresponds with the more rapid movement of areas of low\r\nand high barometric pressure over the United States.\r\n\r\nThese results are suggestive. For instance, the energy of the upper\r\nhalf of the mass of the atmosphere, or that portion which lies above\r\n18,000 feet, has been calculated to possess six times the energy of\r\nthe lower half in which we live, and as yet, none of this enormous\r\nstore of energy is applied to the use of man. While it appears certain\r\nthat no navigable balloon or flying machine will ever be able to stem\r\nthe enormous velocity of the upper atmosphere, rarified though it is,\r\nperhaps in the future aÎrial machines will take advantage of the\r\nprevailing currents of the high atmosphere, as our sailing ships do of\r\nthe trade winds. The observations of cirrus clouds in various parts of\r\nthe world show that they always move from a general westerly\r\ndirection, while below this primary drift toward the east occur the\r\nrelatively permanent or transient differences of pressure which cause\r\nthe deviations from the normal circulation of the atmosphere, and give\r\nrise to the local circulation in storms. In the familiar daily weather\r\nmap it will be noticed that there is usually some portion marked\r\n\"low,\" and another portion marked \"high.\" The former is an area of low\r\nbarometric pressure, into which the winds at the ground blow spirally\r\ninward in the opposite direction that the clock hands turn; the latter\r\nis an area of high barometer, out of which the winds at the ground\r\nblow in the contrary way. The former when well developed are called\r\n\"cyclones,\" and are usually accompanied by stormy weather, and the\r\nlatter, called \"anti-cyclones,\" bring fair weather. From the\r\nobservations of the directions from which the clouds move in cyclones\r\nand anti-cyclones, we have found that above the cumulus level (at the\r\nheight of about a mile) the inward inclination of the wind in a\r\ncyclone, and the outward inclination in an anti-cyclone, both\r\ndisappear, and the general drift from the west prevails. The results\r\nof the observations are shown in Plate V., Atmospheric Circulation in\r\nCyclones and Anti-cyclones, representing sections of the atmosphere,\r\nconcentric to the earth's surface, in the five cloud-levels seen from\r\nabove. The arrows fly with the wind and are proportional in length to\r\nits velocity, the dotted arrows indicating the probable flow of the\r\nair through the cyclones and anti-cyclones that are indicated by the\r\ncircles, their axes being assumed to be nearly perpendicular to the\r\nearth's surface. Above the cumulus it will be observed that the wind\r\nin the cyclone tends to come from the south-west in front and from the\r\nnorth-west in the rear, while in the anti-cyclone the contrary is the\r\ncase, indicating a deflection of the westerly upper current to the\r\nright in cyclones and to the left in anti-cyclones. This sustains the\r\ntheory that the cyclonic circulation is struggling against a general\r\natmospheric drift from the west which increases with altitude, and\r\nabove the height of a mile becomes greater than the cyclonic\r\ninfluence. Higher than this, the atmospheric circulation is\r\ncontrolled primarily by the permanent temperature gradient between\r\nequator and pole, by the seasonal temperature gradient between ocean\r\nand continent, and, in the United States, by the passage of \"warm and\r\ncold waves.\" Mr. Clayton's investigations indicate that the motion of\r\nthe upper clouds is nearly parallel to the lines of equal temperature\r\nat the earth's surface. A high temperature, by expanding the air\r\nupward, causes in the upper air a high pressure; and a low\r\ntemperature, by contracting the air towards the ground, causes in the\r\nupper air a low pressure, so that the lines of equal pressure in the\r\nupper air are parallel to the lower lines of equal temperature, and\r\nsince there is little friction in the upper air the motion of the wind\r\nis nearly parallel to the lines of equal pressure. Below the cumulus\r\nlevel the winds follow the normal cyclonic and anti-cyclonic\r\ncirculation. There are two theories of the origin of these areas of\r\nhigh and low pressure, the \"driven theory\" which supposes that they\r\nderive their energy and drift from the general atmospheric movement\r\nfrom west to east, and the \"convectional theory\" which attributes\r\ntheir formation and progression to the difference of temperature\r\nbetween them and the adjacent air. While the observations on mountains\r\nhave favoured the driven theory, yet the inward spiral motion of the\r\ncirrus clouds above the anti-cyclone, indicating a lower pressure\r\nthan in the surrounding air, contradicts the hypothesis, and the\r\nrecent observations with kites at Blue Hill strongly support the\r\nconvectional theory of cyclones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS IN\r\n   CYCLONES ANTI-CYCLONES\r\n   PLATE V.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the clouds to weather forecasting has been\r\ninvestigated at Blue Hill. For instance, it is found, in this region\r\nat least, and contrary to the general opinion, that cirrus clouds do\r\nnot indicate rain, but do foretell a change of temperature that is\r\nproportional to the rapidity of motion of the clouds. Alto-cumulus is\r\nfollowed by rain within twenty-four hours three times in four. Rain\r\nfollows the appearance of all high and intermediate clouds most\r\nfrequently when the cloud banks are densest toward some westerly point\r\nand when they come from the west. Mr. Sweetland, an assistant, has\r\nstudied special forms of cloud in their relation to the succeeding\r\nweather. He concludes that cirrus plumes precede fair weather, while\r\ndense clots of cirro-cumulus are followed by rain. Rounded pendants,\r\nor mammillated clouds, in the lower levels indicate rain, but in the\r\nupper levels fair weather. Of all the forms, the dark sheet of\r\nstratus, and clouds of lenticular shape, are most frequently followed\r\nby rain. Of clouds presaging changes in temperature, the turreted\r\ncumulus, which is connected with thunder-storms, precedes the\r\ngreatest fall in temperature, and next in order come lenticular\r\nclouds, flaky cirrus, and alto-cumulus. In general, flat and flaky\r\nclouds, clouds forming and disappearing rapidly, and clouds changing\r\nto forms at a higher level precede dry and cooler weather.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this modern study of clouds as prognostics simply\r\nadds to the weather proverbs that have come down to us from the time\r\nof Theophrastus. It does not appear, however, that cloud forms alone\r\ncan usually serve to predict rain for more than twenty-four hours, but\r\nfor a few hours in advance the appearance of certain cloud forms\r\nfrequently furnishes the observer more trustworthy signs of coming\r\nrain than does the synoptic weather map. To a forecaster in possession\r\nof telegraphic data, the prevalence of rapidly-moving cirrus over a\r\nwide area indicates a rapid storm movement, with sudden and marked\r\nchanges of weather and of temperature, while slowly-moving cirrus\r\nindicate slight changes of temperature and dry weather. The direction\r\nof the cirrus movements in front and around a storm centre will\r\nusually point out the future movement of the storm, which tends to\r\nadvance in the same general direction.\r\n\r\nThe work done at Blue Hill shows the importance of cloud observations\r\nto elucidate the general movements of the atmosphere, as well as the\r\ncirculation of the air above barometric maxima and minima, which can\r\nresult practically in making accurate weather forecasts possible a day\r\nor two in advance. The systematic observation of the upper currents\r\nwas brought to the attention of the International Meteorological\r\nCommittee by Dr. Hildebrandsson in 1885, and at the meeting of the\r\nInternational Cloud Committee in 1894, besides the adoption of the\r\nnomenclature of clouds and instructions for observing them, it was\r\ndecided that observations of their motion, as well as measurements of\r\ntheir height, should be made in various parts of the world.\r\nAccordingly, the year commencing May 1, 1896, was designated as the\r\n\"International Cloud-Year,\" and observations with nephoscopes of the\r\ndirection of motion and relative velocity of clouds were begun at many\r\nstations in Europe and Asia, and at fifteen stations in the United\r\nStates. Trigonometrical measures of the heights of clouds were\r\nundertaken at stations in Norway and Sweden, Russia, Finland, Prussia,\r\nand France, as well as at Toronto, Manila, and Batavia; in the United\r\nStates the measurements already described were recommenced at Blue\r\nHill, and the Weather Bureau equipped a similar station in Washington.\r\nIn Europe it is thought that the determination of heights by\r\nphotogrammeters, as the theodolites with attached photographic\r\ncameras are called, possesses advantages over the visual theodolites,\r\nand it is true that not only is the kind of cloud recorded on the\r\nplates, but there are available for calculation as many points on the\r\ncloud as can be identified on the two plates exposed simultaneously at\r\nboth stations. On the other hand, in the case of nearly uniform or\r\ndark cloud-strata, it is easier to see points for measurement on the\r\ncloud than to fix them on the photographic plates. For this reason,\r\nand from the difficulty of manipulating the photogrammeter, visual\r\ninstruments were adopted both at Blue Hill and at Washington. The work\r\nwas successfully carried on until May 1, 1897, and the observations\r\nand measurements were reduced at Blue Hill according to the plan\r\nprescribed by the Committee. Already the observations and measurements\r\nmade at Upsala, Manila, and Blue Hill are published, and the others\r\nwill follow. The discussion of the correlated data from the various\r\ncountries will probably increase our knowledge of the circulation of\r\nthe atmosphere, which is certainly one of the most interesting and\r\nimportant questions in the physics of the globe. The result will have\r\nbeen reached by international co-operation, of which the benefits to\r\nscience are everywhere manifest to-day. But for the whole problem to\r\nbe solved, it is necessary, not only to know the movement of the air,\r\nbut, as far as possible, to ascertain its conditions of heat and\r\nmoisture. This may be accomplished by the use of balloons and kites,\r\nto be described in the remaining chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n   BALLOONS--NOTABLE ASCENTS AND RESULTS OBTAINED--CAPTIVE BALLOONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter the invention of the hot-air and the hydrogen\r\nballoon was chronicled, and it was stated that on December 1, 1783,\r\nCharles rose from Paris to a height of 9000 feet. Public interest in\r\nFrance was greatly excited by this wonderful extension of the realm of\r\nman, and numerous ascensions with _MontgolfiËres_ and _CharliËres_, as\r\nthe hot-air and hydrogen balloons were respectively called, took place\r\nin Paris and the provinces. The uses of the balloon seemed\r\ninnumerable, and Lavoisier was instructed by the Academy of Sciences\r\nto draw up a report on the value of the new discovery. After having\r\ndescribed in detail the ascensions which he had witnessed, the great\r\nchemist stopped, appalled at the multitude of problems which the\r\nballoon could solve. History has shown, however, that no commercial\r\napplication of the balloon was possible, and that aside from its\r\nspectacular attractions, its chief use has been for scientific\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe first persons in England who devoted themselves to aÎrial\r\nnavigation were foreigners. Two of them were Italians, the philosopher\r\nTiberius Cavallo, who already in 1782 had showed to a London assembly\r\nthat soap-bubbles filled with hydrogen will rise, and therefore had\r\nalmost anticipated the invention of the hydrogen balloon, and the\r\ndiplomatist Vincent Lunardi, who made some daring balloon ascents in\r\n1784. But the honour of making the first scientific balloon voyage is\r\ndue to a Bostonian, Dr. John Jeffries. Dr. Jeffries graduated at\r\nHarvard College in 1763 and then practised medicine in England, where\r\nhe became a loyalist, and during the Revolution was with the British\r\ntroops. In London he interested himself in aerostation, and, aided by\r\nthe Royal Society, ascended in a balloon because, he said, \"I wished\r\nto see the following points more clearly determined: first, the power\r\nof ascending or descending at pleasure, while suspended and floating\r\nin the air; secondly, the effect which oars or wings might be made to\r\nproduce towards the purpose and in directing the course of the\r\nballoon; thirdly, the state and temperature of the atmosphere at\r\ndifferent heights from the earth; and fourthly, by observing the\r\nvarying course of the currents of air, or winds, at certain\r\nelevations, to throw some new light on the theory of winds in\r\ngeneral.\" A French professional aeronaut named Blanchard had made\r\nthree ascents in France and one in England, and Dr. Jeffries paid one\r\nhundred guineas to accompany Blanchard on his fifth ascent, which was\r\nmade from London November 30, 1784. He took with him a thermometer, a\r\nbarometer, a hygrometer, an electrometer, and a mariner's compass,\r\nalso several numbered bottles, filled with water and provided with\r\nglass stoppers, which were to be emptied and corked up at different\r\nheights in the atmosphere. It was arranged to record the observations\r\non ruled paper with a silver pen, because the doctor would not trust a\r\ncommon pen or pencil as liable to accident. He also had a map of\r\nEngland to determine the direction which the balloon took. Jeffries'\r\nEnglish sentiments are shown by this quotation from his narrative: \"I\r\nhad provided a handsome British flag, invidiously represented the next\r\nday in one of the public papers to have been the flag of the American\r\nStates.\" The barometer and thermometer were observed every few\r\nminutes, and the hygrometer occasionally. The electrometer did not\r\nchange its indications. Samples of air were obtained and sent to the\r\nRoyal Society, but it does not appear that they were ever analyzed.\r\nThe balloon rose nearly two miles, and descended safely in Kent after\r\nan hour and a half. Jeffries' observations compare favourably with\r\nthose made until recently; indeed, for nearly a century there was\r\nlittle improvement in the apparatus. The decrease of temperature which\r\nJeffries found, viz. 1∞ for 360 feet rise, and the decreasing humidity\r\nwith height agree very well with later observations.\r\n\r\nJeffries and Blanchard undertook a more perilous voyage on January 7,\r\n1785, from Dover across the Channel, landing in the province of\r\nArtois, after, so runs the announcement, \"we were suspended and\r\nfloating in the atmosphere two hours over the sea and forty-seven\r\nminutes over the land of France.\" The voyagers were cordially\r\nwelcomed, and were entertained lavishly in Paris as being, Jeffries\r\nsays, \"the first who passed across the sea from England into France by\r\nthe route of the air.\" No instruments but a barometer and a compass\r\nwere carried, and the only scientific result worthy of notice was that\r\nthe balloon seemed to lose buoyancy over the sea, due to what Jeffries\r\nthought might be \"the power of attraction over the water.\" The height\r\nof the balloon was measured trigonometrically by French officers in\r\nCalais, who found by angular measures, when the balloon was midway\r\nacross the Channel, that its height was 4500 feet. Jeffries' voyages\r\nhave been described somewhat at length because the first scientific\r\nballoon voyage is generally attributed to the Belgian physicist,\r\nRobertson, who ascended from Hamburg in 1803 to the improbable height\r\nof 24,000 feet. Robertson made his third ascent the next year from St.\r\nPetersburg, accompanied by the Academician Sacharoff. This was a\r\nscientific voyage, instituted at the request of the Russian Academy,\r\nto ascertain the physical state of the atmosphere and the component\r\nparts of it at different heights, also the difference between the\r\nresults of vertical ascents and the observations of Deluc, De\r\nSaussure, von Humboldt and others on mountains, which it was rightly\r\nconcluded could not be so free from terrestrial influences as those\r\nmade in the open air. Among the experiments which the Academy proposed\r\nwere the following: change of rate of evaporation of fluids, decrease\r\nor increase in the magnetic force, inclination of the magnetic needle,\r\nincrease of heat of the solar rays, fainter colours in the spectrum,\r\ninfluence of rarefaction of the air on the human body, as well as some\r\nother chemical and philosophical experiments. A height of about two\r\nmiles was reached, and many interesting observations were made, but\r\nsince the instruments were not easily used in the basket of the\r\nballoon, the results were unsatisfactory and required repetition to be\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences of Paris now took up the investigation with\r\nthe special object of proving whether the magnetic force decreased as\r\nRobertson in a balloon and De Saussure in the Alps had supposed. Two\r\nyoung physicists, Biot and Gay-Lussac, were chosen to carry out the\r\ninvestigations. They ascended from Paris on August 24, 1804, provided\r\nwith all necessary instruments, but the balloon was too small to rise\r\nhigher than 13,000 feet. Gay-Lussac ascended alone to a height of\r\n23,000 feet on September 16, 1804, in a balloon filled with hydrogen.\r\nHis observations confirmed those which he had made with Biot, that\r\nthere was no change in the magnetic force, and from samples of air\r\ncollected he proved that the chemical constitution of the air is\r\ninvariable. His observations of temperature seemed to confirm the\r\ntheory of a decline of temperature of 1∞ in 300 feet of elevation. The\r\nair was found to be very dry, and Gay-Lussac noticed that at the\r\nhighest altitude the clouds were still far above him.\r\n\r\nPassing over several notable ascents in other countries, it was not\r\nuntil 1850 that scientific ballooning was begun again in the land\r\nwhere the balloon originated. Then MM. Barral and Bixio made two\r\nascents from Paris in rainy weather to the heights of 19,000 and\r\n23,000 feet respectively, although they had expected to attain twice\r\nthese altitudes. Their most interesting observations were the great\r\nthickness of the cloud mass, which in one case amounted to 15,000\r\nfeet, and the sudden fall of temperature in it from +15∞ to -39∞. Some\r\ncurious optical phenomena were connected with the floating ice\r\ncrystals, and although the light of the sky was found to be strongly\r\npolarized, the light reflected from the clouds was not polarized.\r\n\r\nThe field of operations was now transferred to England, where, under\r\nthe auspices of the British Association, four ascents were made by\r\nJohn Welsh of the Kew Observatory in the great _Nassau_ balloon\r\nmanaged by Green, the veteran aeronaut. The special object of these\r\ninvestigations, like those in France, was the determination of the\r\ntemperature and hygrometric condition of the air at different\r\nelevations. Besides this, samples of air at different heights were\r\ncollected for analysis and the light reflected from clouds was\r\nexamined for polarization. Recognizing that on account of the calm\r\nprevailing in the car of the balloon and the great solar radiation,\r\nthe readings of the thermometer would be affected, Welsh enclosed the\r\nthermometers in polished tubes through which air was forced by\r\nbellows. This was the first aspirated thermometer, which alone gives\r\nthe true temperature of the air with the conditions prevailing in a\r\nballoon. The instrument fell into oblivion until a few years ago, and\r\nto this fact is due the fictitious temperatures generally obtained by\r\naeronauts. Welsh reached heights of from 12,500 to 23,000 feet, and\r\nhis observations showed that the temperature of the air decreased\r\nuniformly with height until at a certain elevation, varying on\r\ndifferent days, the decrease is arrested, and for a space of 2000 or\r\n3000 feet the temperature remains nearly constant, or even increases\r\nslightly; the regular diminution being afterwards resumed and\r\ngenerally maintained at a less rapid rate than in the lower air, and\r\ncommencing from a higher temperature than would have existed but for\r\nthe interruption. The variation of the decrease with the seasons was\r\nalso demonstrated. The humidity did not change much with height, and\r\nit was nowhere very dry. Finally, the light of the clouds was proved\r\nnot to be polarized, and the permanent composition of the atmosphere\r\nwas confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 another grant of money was made by the British Association for\r\nballoon experiments to be performed, under the direction of a\r\nCommittee, by Mr. James Glaisher, then engaged in geodetic and\r\nmeteorological work in England. Between 1862 and 1868 Glaisher,\r\naccompanied by the aeronaut Coxwell, made thirty ascents. They\r\nattained three times a height exceeding 23,000 feet, and once more\r\nthan 29,000 feet, when they believed that the balloon rose to 37,000\r\nfeet. The primary objects of Glaisher's experiments were as follows:\r\ndetermination of the temperature of the air and its hygrometrical\r\nconditions up to five miles, comparisons of an aneroid barometer with\r\na mercurial one, determination of the electrical state of the air and\r\nof its oxygenic state by means of ozone papers, time of vibration of a\r\nmagnet at different distances from the earth. Secondary objects of\r\nstudy were the composition of the air, the form and thickness of\r\nclouds, the atmospheric currents, acoustical phenomena, etc. In order\r\nto obtain many observations frequent ascents were necessary, as the\r\ninsular position of England precluded long voyages. During 1869\r\nascents in a captive balloon up to 1700 feet supplemented the\r\nemployment of the free balloon, which from its rapid rise and fall\r\nmade observations in it near the earth impossible. Glaisher was a good\r\nobserver; his instruments were excellent, and had been previously\r\ntested, but their exposure in the basket of the balloon was bad, and\r\nalthough the thermometer was provided with an aspirator similar to\r\nWelsh's, Glaisher, noticing that the readings agreed with those of a\r\nfreely exposed thermometer, hastily concluded that the use of the\r\naspirator was unnecessary, and so discarded it.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently Glaisher's results were accepted as representing\r\nthe conditions of the free air up to the greatest height which it was\r\npossible to reach. These results showed that the temperature did not\r\nfall uniformly with height, but that it fell most rapidly near the\r\nearth and much less rapidly at great heights. In cloudy weather up to\r\nthe height of a mile the mean decrease of temperature in the day-time\r\ndiffered little from the theory of 1∞ per 300 feet, but in clear or\r\npartly clear weather the decrease was more rapid, commencing with 1∞\r\nfor 160 feet near the ground and diminishing to 1∞ for 1000 feet at an\r\nelevation exceeding six miles. The observations in the captive balloon\r\nup to a third of a mile indicated a daily range in the vertical\r\ndecrease of temperature. The observations of relative humidity agreed\r\nwith Welsh's in showing a slight increase up to about half-a-mile,\r\nthen a decrease up to above five miles, where there seemed to be an\r\nalmost entire absence of water. The other observations were\r\ninconclusive, except that the time of vibration of a magnet was found\r\nto be somewhat longer than on the earth, which was contrary to\r\nGay-Lussac's experience. The most remarkable of Glaisher's ascents was\r\nmade from Wolverhampton on September 5, 1862, when in less than one\r\nhour he had passed the altitude of five miles, exceeding the greatest\r\nheight hitherto reached. To quote from Glaisher's narrative: \"Up to\r\nthis time I had taken observations with comfort and experienced no\r\ndifficulty in breathing, whilst Mr. Coxwell, in consequence of the\r\nexertion he had to make, had breathed with difficulty for some time.\r\nHaving discharged sand, we ascended still higher; the aspirator became\r\ntroublesome to work, and I also found a difficulty in seeing\r\nclearly.... About 1 hour 52 min., or later, I read the dry-bulb\r\nthermometer as minus 5∞; after this I could not see the column of\r\nmercury in the wet-bulb thermometer, nor the hands of the watch, nor\r\nthe fine divisions of any instrument. I asked Mr. Coxwell to help me\r\nto read the instruments. In consequence, however, of the rotatory\r\nmotion of the balloon, which had continued without ceasing since\r\nleaving the earth, the valve-line had become entangled, and he had to\r\nleave the car and mount into the ring to readjust it. I then looked at\r\nthe barometer, and found its reading to be 9-3/4 inches, still\r\ndecreasing fast, and implying a height exceeding 29,000 feet. Shortly\r\nafter, I laid my arm upon the table, possessed of its full vigour, but\r\non being desirous of using it, I found it powerless.... Trying to move\r\nthe other arm, I found it powerless also. Then I tried to shake myself\r\nand succeeded, but I seemed to have no limbs.... I dimly saw Mr.\r\nCoxwell, and endeavoured to speak, but could not. In an instant\r\nintense darkness overcame me, so that the optic nerve lost power\r\nsuddenly, but I was still conscious, with as active a brain as at the\r\npresent moment whilst writing this. I thought I had been seized with\r\nasphyxia, and believed I should experience nothing more, as death\r\nwould come unless we speedily descended; other thoughts were entering\r\nmy mind, when I suddenly became unconscious.... I cannot tell anything\r\nof the sense of hearing, as no sound reaches the air to break the\r\nperfect stillness and silence of the regions between six and seven\r\nmiles above the earth. My last observation was made at 1 hour 54 min.,\r\nabove 29,000 feet.... Whilst powerless I heard the words,\r\n'temperature' and 'observation,' and I knew Mr. Coxwell was in the car\r\nspeaking to and endeavouring to rouse me.... I then heard him speak\r\nmore emphatically, but could not see, speak, or move. I heard him\r\nagain say, 'Do try; now do!' Then the instruments became dimly\r\nvisible, then Mr. Coxwell, and very shortly I saw clearly.... Mr.\r\nCoxwell told me that while in the ring he felt it piercingly cold,\r\nthat hoarfrost was all round the neck of the balloon, and that on\r\nattempting to leave the ring he found his hands frozen. He had,\r\ntherefore, to place his arms on the ring and drop down.... He wished\r\nto approach me, but could not; and when he felt insensibility coming\r\nover him too, he became anxious to open the valve. But in consequence\r\nof having lost the use of his hands he could not do this; ultimately\r\nhe succeeded, by seizing the cord with his teeth, and dipping his head\r\ntwo or three times, until the balloon took a decided turn downwards.\r\nNo inconvenience followed my insensibility; and when we dropped, it\r\nwas in a country where no conveyance of any kind could be obtained, so\r\nI had to walk between seven and eight miles.... I have already said\r\nthat my last observation was made at a height of 29,000 feet; at this\r\ntime (1 hour 54 min.) we were ascending at the rate of 1000 feet per\r\nminute; and when I resumed observations we were descending at the rate\r\nof 2000 feet per minute. These two positions must be connected, taking\r\ninto account the interval of time between, viz. 13 minutes, and on\r\nthese considerations the balloon must have attained the altitude of\r\n36,000 or 37,000 feet. Again, a very delicate minimum thermometer read\r\nminus 11∞.9, and this would give a height of 37,000 feet. Mr. Coxwell,\r\non coming from the ring, noticed that the centre of the aneroid\r\nbarometer, its blue hand, and a rope attached to the car were all in\r\nthe same straight line, and this gave a reading of seven inches and\r\nleads to the same result. Therefore, these independent means all lead\r\nto about the same elevation, viz. fully seven miles.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Glaisher's circumstantial evidence of the height he reached has\r\nbeen assailed lately, partly from his assumption that the velocity of\r\nthe balloon while rising and falling during the thirteen minutes was\r\nuniform, but principally from the supposition that men could have\r\nsurvived in that region of death, without at least artificial means of\r\nrespiration. While it is certain that Berson's observations, which are\r\ndescribed later, were made at a greater height than Glaisher's, yet\r\nall credit must be given to this Nestor of aeronautical and\r\nmeteorological science in Great Britain, who is still living at the\r\nadvanced age of ninety.\r\n\r\nThe example of Glaisher was not followed in England, but it stimulated\r\ninterest in the balloon again in France, where MM. Flammarion, de\r\nFonvielle, and Tissandier have made many ascents for scientific\r\npurposes, and have presented the results in a popular form to the\r\npublic. Photography in a balloon is generally a failure on account of\r\nthe intense reflection from the upper cloud surfaces and the haze\r\nwhich masks the earth. Consequently, for scenic effects we must rely\r\nupon sketches, of which those in that interesting, but now rather rare\r\nbook, _Travels in the Air_, may be referred to. The high atmosphere is\r\noften filled with fine ice crystals which, though invisible from\r\nbelow, occasion curious optical phenomena, and some of these have\r\nbeen sketched by M. Albert Tissandier, who has the advantage of being\r\nan artist as well as an aeronaut.\r\n\r\nOf the many narratives of balloon voyages, one of the most thrilling\r\nis the tragedy of the _Zenith_. In 1875, through the co-operation of\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences and other scientific bodies, it was\r\narranged to make two voyages, one of long duration, the other to a\r\ngreat height, in the balloon _Zenith_. The long voyage from Paris to\r\nBordeaux was successfully accomplished in twenty-four hours, and on\r\nApril 15 the _Zenith_ again rose from Paris, carrying MM. Gaston\r\nTissandier and CrocÈ-Spinelli, with Sivel as aeronaut. By the advice\r\nof M. Paul Bert, the distinguished physiologist, three small balloons\r\nof oxygen were provided to assist respiration. The scientific\r\napparatus was as follows: a pump was arranged to draw air through\r\ntubes filled with potash in which to store the carbonic acid at\r\ndifferent heights in the atmosphere, in order that analysis might\r\ndetermine if its proportion diminished at great heights; a\r\nspectroscope was employed to examine the line of water-vapour in the\r\natmosphere, and two aneroid barometers were provided, one giving the\r\npressure corresponding to heights up to 13,000 feet, the other the\r\npressure between 13,000 and 30,000 feet. There were also two\r\nbarometric tubes registering the lowest pressure, as well as\r\nthermometers and other scientific instruments. At 15,000 feet the\r\nvoyagers began to breathe oxygen, which had been used beneficially by\r\nSivel and CrocÈ-Spinelli in a high ascent the previous year. At 24,000\r\nfeet Tissandier wrote in his notes: \"My hands are freezing. I am well.\r\nWe are all right. Haze on horizon with small rounded cirrus. We are\r\nrising. CrocÈ pants. We breathe oxygen. Sivel shuts his eyes, CrocÈ\r\ndoes the same.\" Five minutes later: \"Sivel throws out ballast,\r\ntemperature -11∞ Cent., barometer 300 millimeters.\" After this,\r\nTissandier became so weak that he could not turn his head to look at\r\nhis companions. He tried to seize the oxygen tube, but was unable to\r\nmove his arms. His mind was clear, and he saw the barometer sink below\r\n280 millimeters, indicating a height of 27,000 feet. Then he fainted.\r\nAfter a half-hour of unconsciousness he revived and wrote: \"We are\r\nfalling, temperature -8∞, barometer 315 millimeters. I discharge\r\nballast. CrocÈ and Sivel unconscious in bottom of basket. We fall\r\nrapidly.\" Again he fell into a stupor, from which he was roused by\r\nCrocÈ shaking his arm, saying, \"Throw out ballast!\" which he did,\r\ntogether with the pump, wraps, etc. What happened after this is\r\nunknown, but probably the balloon, thus lightened and the gas in it\r\nbeing warm, rose again nearly as high as before. When Tissandier came\r\nto his senses the balloon was falling with frightful speed, and in the\r\nbottom of the basket, which was oscillating violently from side to\r\nside, were crouched his two companions with black faces and bloody\r\nmouths. The shock of striking the ground was terrific, but the anchor\r\nheld, and the balloon soon emptied. From the barometric data it\r\nappears probable that the _Zenith_ attained twice a height of about\r\n28,000 feet, and that asphyxiation from the long deprivation of\r\nsufficient oxygen killed the two companions of Tissandier and nearly\r\nproved fatal to him.\r\n\r\nThis disaster discouraged further attempts to reach high altitudes,\r\nand with the exception of the ascent to 23,000 feet in France by MM.\r\nJovis and Mallet, no more were made until the past decade. The results\r\nof the meteorological observations were seen to be strangely\r\ndiscordant; for example, the temperature of 40∞ below zero, observed\r\nby Barral and Bixio at a height of 23,000 feet, and 80∞ above zero,\r\nnoted by the American aeronaut Wise, at 6000 feet. The prophecy \"that\r\nthe balloon-basket would be the cradle of the young science of\r\nmeteorology\" seemed unlikely to be realized, but, nevertheless,\r\nobservations in balloons continued to be made in France, Italy, and\r\nRussia. In the United States a series of balloon ascents was\r\nconducted by the Signal Service, which then included the Weather\r\nBureau, and the height of 15,500 feet reached by Professor Hazen in\r\n1887 is probably the greatest at which observations in the free air\r\nhave been made in America.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining the true temperature of the air from a\r\nballoon is great, and without special precautions the observations\r\ngive the conditions of the free air even less well than do\r\nobservations on mountain summits. During a rapid ascent the air is\r\ncarried up in the balloon basket like water in a well-bucket, and\r\nsince the balloon drifts with the wind it is relatively in a calm, so\r\nthat there is no circulation of air; the thermometers, even when\r\nscreened from direct sunshine, are affected by radiation from the\r\nheated gas-bag above, and moreover they are not sufficiently sensitive\r\nto follow the changing temperature of the air strata so quickly\r\ntraversed by the balloon. The aneroid barometer, from which the height\r\nof the balloon is calculated, cannot respond to rapid changes of\r\npressure; consequently there is a double source of error in\r\ndetermining the height at which the temperature is measured.\r\nOrdinarily, the temperature of the air may be obtained quite\r\naccurately by slinging in a circle a thermometer attached to a cord,\r\neven though this is done in sunshine. During two balloon ascents by\r\nthe writer, a sling thermometer was found in extreme cases to read 14∞\r\nlower than was recorded by automatic instruments, hung in their usual\r\nposition from the ring of the balloon. The sling thermometer, however,\r\nis influenced by intense insolation, and moreover cannot be swung far\r\nenough outside the basket of a balloon to insure good results. The\r\nstandard instrument for obtaining the temperature of the air under all\r\nconditions, adopted for international use in 1898, is a modification\r\nof that used by Welsh forty-five years before. This instrument, which\r\nis the invention of Dr. Assmann of Berlin, is called the aspiration\r\nthermometer, and is designed to prevent the casing surrounding the\r\nthermometer from being heated by insolation or conduction, and to\r\ninsure a flow of air past the thermometer bulbs.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 3.--German Balloon equipped for\r\n   Meteorological Observations.]\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of balloon observations was accomplished by the\r\nGerman Society for the Promotion of AÎrial Navigation, which has been\r\nassisted by the Prussian Meteorological Institute, and by officers of\r\nthe German Army Balloon Corps. The German Emperor takes a personal\r\ninterest in the work, and has aided it by the gift of a considerable\r\nsum of money. The first voyage under the direction of the Society was\r\nmade in 1888, and many notable ones followed. In 1891, through the\r\ncourtesy of the president, Dr. Assmann, the writer made an ascent\r\nfrom Berlin in a balloon equipped for accurate observations, with the\r\nspecial purpose of comparing the sling with the aspiration\r\nthermometer. The car of the balloon is shown in Fig. 3. A companion\r\nwas the now famous Dr. Berson, who then made his second ascent, but\r\nwho has now become an expert aeronaut by reason of more than fifty\r\nascensions, some of them to great heights. On December 4, 1894, he\r\nascended alone from Stassfurt, Prussia, in the _Phoenix_, to\r\nprobably the greatest height ever reached by man, at least in a\r\nconscious state. By breathing oxygen he was able to keep his senses\r\nand to read the barometer at 9∑1 inches, indicating approximately an\r\naltitude of 30,000 feet, and the aspirated thermometer at 54∞ below\r\nzero. An ordinary thermometer read 11∞ below zero in the sun, showing\r\nits heat was much diminished in consequence of the haze that prevailed\r\neven at this enormous height. The cirriform clouds which surrounded\r\nthe balloon were found to have the structure of snow-flakes rather\r\nthan that of ice-crystals. The chief result of this record-breaking\r\nascent was the extraordinarily low temperatures recorded at great\r\nheights, as compared with those observed by Glaisher, Tissandier, and\r\nothers. An inversion of temperature--that is an increase of\r\ntemperature with height--prevailed up to a mile, but above that the\r\ntemperature fell at a rapid and accelerated rate which approached the\r\nadiabatic fall above 26,000 feet. The wind, which was almost calm at\r\nthe earth's surface, increased to a gale in the high atmosphere, and\r\ncarried the balloon along at an average speed of thirty-six miles an\r\nhour. Wishing to demonstrate conclusively whether the insular position\r\nof England influenced the temperature of the high atmosphere, as had\r\nbeen suggested, Dr. Berson determined to execute a high ascension in\r\nEngland during the prevalence of a barometric maximum in summer, when\r\nthe air column would be abnormally warmed and the upper isothermal\r\nsurfaces elevated. An opportunity was afforded Berson to follow in\r\nGlaisher's footsteps on September 14, 1898, when abnormal heat\r\nprevailed in Europe. Berson, with the aeronaut Spencer, in the balloon\r\n_Excelsior_, rose from the Crystal Palace in London to the height of\r\n27,300 feet, where he observed a temperature of -29∞. The oxygen\r\ninhaled prevented harmful physiological effects except for the\r\ndiscomfort caused by the enormous reduction of temperature from 80∞ at\r\nthe ground only thirty-five minutes before. The temperature decreased\r\nrapidly at first, then moderately up to three miles, and above that it\r\nfell almost at the adiabatic rate. Even in this hot summer maximum of\r\npressure and notwithstanding the maritime climate and south-westerly\r\ncurrents, a temperature about 29∞ below zero reigned at 27,000 feet,\r\nbeing only a few degrees warmer than Berson had observed in winter at\r\nthe same height above Germany. Yet Glaisher, in all his ascents, two\r\nof which exceeded 26,000 feet, never recorded a temperature of less\r\nthan 5∞ below zero. These relatively high temperatures, obtained also\r\nby Welsh, Tissandier, and Gay-Lussac, must be attributed to the\r\ninsufficient protection of the thermometers against insolation, to the\r\nproximity of the instruments to the heated basket and its occupants,\r\nand lastly, to the sluggishness of the thermometers themselves, from\r\nlack of ventilation, during the rapid passage through air-strata of\r\ndifferent temperatures. Plate VI. indicates the change of temperature\r\nwith height observed during the four highest balloon ascents in Europe\r\nand in the United States. Dots indicate the observations while\r\nascending, and crosses the observations while descending; these are\r\nconnected by full and broken lines respectively, an inclination upward\r\nto the left showing a decrease of temperature with height and _vice\r\nvers‚_. The adiabatic lines, representing a fall of temperature of 1∞\r\nFahrenheit per 183 feet of ascent, serve for comparison.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE VI.--Temperatures observed in Four High\r\n   Balloon Ascents.]\r\n\r\nThis account of notable balloon ascents should not be closed without\r\nmentioning the most daring and unique of all, the voyage of Mr. S. A.\r\nAndrÈe towards the north pole in 1897. Although his was a voyage of\r\ngeographical discovery, and not one for the exploration of the air,\r\nyet meteorological and other observations were to be made, and AndrÈe\r\nhad familiarized himself with the instruments and the management of a\r\nballoon during several voyages in Sweden. The success of the polar\r\nvoyage depended primarily upon the prevalence of southerly winds, and\r\nthe ability of the balloon to keep afloat long enough to profit by\r\nthem, even should they be light and variable at times. Therefore the\r\nimpermeability of the balloon to hydrogen gas was of vital\r\nimportance, and it was the conviction that the _Eagle_, of 140,000\r\ncubic feet, was neither sufficiently large nor staunch to sustain\r\nitself for thirty days, the time which might be required to reach\r\nBehring Straits, that led Dr. Nils Ekholm, the meteorologist and\r\nphysicist, to withdraw from the expedition. Unfortunately, his fears\r\nseem to have been well founded, and it is probable that we must now\r\nabandon hope of the safety of the brave AndrÈe and his two companions.\r\n\r\nA less perilous voyage northward across the Alps was attempted in 1898\r\nby Professor Heim, the Swiss geologist, and two associates, conducted\r\nby the Italian aeronaut, Spelterini. With an automatic photographic\r\ncamera, similar to one described in the next chapter, it was hoped to\r\nget views of the high Alps from above, which would be alike valuable\r\nfor geologic and topographic study. Extensive meteorological\r\nobservations were made in connection with the sixth international\r\nballoon ascent, but only the Jura was crossed, at an altitude of\r\n13,000 feet, because the balloon travelled in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, instead of north-east as was expected.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Wise and Donaldson, the American aeronauts, proposed to\r\ncross the Atlantic Ocean in a balloon. The difficulties which present\r\nthemselves in such an undertaking are purely technical, and given a\r\nballoon which loses its gas so slowly that its buoyancy can be\r\nmaintained for several days, there seems to be no reason why such a\r\nballoon, at a height of four or five miles, could not pass from San\r\nFrancisco to New York, or from the United States to Europe, since the\r\nmotion of the upper clouds proves that the high atmosphere moves\r\nalmost constantly with great velocity from the west to the east. The\r\ndirigible balloon has not been realized except in nearly calm weather,\r\nbut the aeronaut can often reverse his direction by ascending or\r\ndescending into a contrary wind to that in which he has been\r\ntravelling. Frequently no clouds separate these opposing currents,\r\nwhich become apparent only when a balloon enters them.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that in 1869 Glaisher made observations in a\r\ncaptive balloon in England up to the height of 1700 feet in order to\r\nstudy the conditions of the air within this distance of the earth,\r\nwhich could not be done in a free and rapidly moving balloon. Although\r\ncaptive balloons are frequently used in the European cities to lift\r\npeople who wish to enjoy the view from a height of 500 or 1000 feet,\r\nthey appear to have been little used by scientific observers since the\r\ntime of Glaisher. In 1890-91 the aeronautical society at Berlin\r\nemployed a captive balloon in connection with the observations in free\r\nballoons which have been described. This captive balloon had a\r\ncapacity of only 5000 cubic feet, but it sufficed to lift an apparatus\r\nweighing sixteen pounds, designed by Dr. Assmann to record atmospheric\r\npressure, as well as the temperature and relative humidity of the air.\r\nThe balloon, attached to a cable 2600 feet long, was drawn down by a\r\nsteam engine. It was possible in this way to have simultaneous\r\nobservations at three levels, viz. near the ground, in the free air at\r\na height of about half-a-mile, and at the highest level attained by a\r\nfree balloon. But the captive balloon is often at a disadvantage, for\r\nthe wind drives it down, and although the meteorograph mentioned had\r\ningenious devices to neutralize the violent shocks caused by this and\r\nby the rebound of the balloon after the gust of wind, yet these\r\nimpaired the automatic record. The height to which the balloon rose\r\nwas so much diminished by the wind that instead of 2600 feet, which\r\nthe balloon attained in calm weather when the cable was vertical, the\r\naverage height of the twenty-four ascents was but half this, and in\r\nvery windy weather the balloon could not rise at all.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 4.--German Kite-balloon.]\r\n\r\nTo obviate these difficulties, a few years ago there was invented by\r\ntwo officers of the German army, Lieutenants von Siegsfeld and von\r\nParseval, a captive balloon capable of resisting strong winds, called,\r\nfrom its action as a kite, the _Drachen-Ballon_ or kite-balloon, and\r\nwhich at the present time is being successfully used in the German\r\nArmy and Navy for reconnoitring in all kinds of weather. A smaller\r\nkite-balloon, of 7700 cubic feet capacity, filled either with\r\nhydrogen or with illuminating gas, was first used to lift\r\nmeteorological instruments at Strassburg in 1898, where it remained at\r\na height of several hundred feet during twenty-four hours. As is seen\r\nfrom Fig. 4, the balloon is cylindrical, with hemispherical ends, and\r\nis attached to its cable like a kite, so that the wind acts to lift\r\nand not to depress it. The cylinder is divided by a diaphragm near its\r\nlower end into two chambers, the upper and larger one being filled\r\nwith gas, while the lower chamber, by means of a valve opening\r\ninwards, receives the pressure of the wind which presses against the\r\ndiaphragm, and preserves the sausage-like form of the balloon in spite\r\nof leakage of gas. Another wind-bag encircling the bottom of the\r\nair-chamber serves as a rudder, and lateral fins or wings give\r\nstability to the balloon about its longer axis. The instruments are\r\nplaced in a basket hung far below the balloon. In cases where there is\r\nlittle or no wind at the ground, captive balloons can render valuable\r\nservice for meteorological observations, but in all other cases kites\r\nare preferable. The reasons for this assertion will be given when we\r\nconsider kites.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be perceived how much the Germans did\r\nto advance scientific ballooning, yet their constant rivals, the\r\nFrench, found a way to surpass them in the exploration of the\r\natmosphere. For several years the struggle for supremacy in the\r\nattainment of the greatest heights was keen between the scientific men\r\nof both countries, but a truce was declared at Paris in 1896, and\r\nsince then both nations have worked together harmoniously. The\r\nfriendly meeting of French and German physicists at Strassburg in 1898\r\nto agree upon the details of co-operation, typified the union of\r\nnations through science, and while it is true that the atmosphere has\r\nno boundaries and cannot be pre-empted, let us hope that the common\r\naims of science will ultimately obliterate even political boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n   _BALLONS-SONDES_ FOR GREAT ALTITUDES--THE INTERNATIONAL ASCENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the ascent of human beings to heights of six miles\r\nis attended with difficulty and danger, and even with apparatus for\r\nsupplying the life-sustaining oxygen, man can hardly hope to reach\r\nmuch greater altitudes. Consequently, to obtain information about the\r\natmospheric strata lying above six miles, that is to say, those facts\r\nwhich require to be ascertained in the medium itself, we must employ\r\nthe so-called _ballons-sondes_, carrying self-recording instruments\r\nbut no observers. This method, which was proposed in Copenhagen as\r\nlong ago as 1809, was first put into execution by the French\r\naeronauts, Hermite and BesanÁon, who, it may be remarked, suggested\r\nattempting to reach the North Pole by balloon some time before AndrÈe\r\nannounced his scheme.\r\n\r\nA balloon is the best of anemometers, since it takes the direction\r\nand speed of the currents in which it floats, and hence it is\r\ncustomary, before a manned balloon starts, to dispatch several small\r\npilot-balloons in order to judge of the direction and strength of the\r\nupper winds. Even if we do not know the height of the currents in\r\nwhich they float, though this can be ascertained by measuring the\r\nheight of the balloon trigonometrically or micrometrically, we still\r\nobtain a general knowledge of the direction and speed of the currents.\r\nWith this idea, M. Bonvallet in 1891 dispatched from Amiens, France,\r\nninety-seven paper balloons, each provided with a postal card asking\r\nfor the time and place of descent. Sixty of these cards were returned,\r\nalmost all the balloons having been carried east by the upper current,\r\nten going beyond one hundred and thirty miles, and one travelling at a\r\nspeed of almost one hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe next year the experiment was continued by MM. Hermite and BesanÁon\r\nwith balloons of thirty-five cubic feet contents, and about half of\r\nthose dispatched from Paris were recovered within a radius of one\r\nhundred miles. The height to which the balloons could rise is\r\ndetermined by the following considerations: to ascend 18,000 feet,\r\nwhere the atmospheric pressure is one-half that at the earth (see\r\nPlate I.), the balloon when half full of gas must lift itself from the\r\nground; to rise 35,000 feet, where the pressure is reduced to\r\none-quarter, it must be able to start upward when one-quarter filled,\r\nand so on. In practice the ascensional force usually diminishes at\r\nfirst from various causes, such as the escape of gas, its cooling, and\r\nthe deposit of moisture on the outside of the balloon. To penetrate\r\nthe clouds, therefore, it is necessary to have a considerable excess\r\nof ascensional force, but above the clouds, since the heating effect\r\nof the sun increases greatly with altitude, the gas in the balloon is\r\nwarmed much above the surrounding air, and so the theoretical\r\naltitudes are exceeded.\r\n\r\nHaving determined that balloons inflated with one hundred and fifty\r\ncubic feet of coal-gas would rise to great heights, simple and light\r\nregistering instruments, as well as the postal cards, were attached to\r\nthem. As the pressure diminished, an aneroid barometer traced a line\r\non a smoked glass, and after the descent was placed under the receiver\r\nof an air-pump, and the pressure required to reproduce the trace was\r\nmeasured by a manometer. From this the height could be computed\r\napproximately. The maximum and minimum thermometer was of the\r\nwell-known U-form, and instructions appended asked that it be read as\r\nsoon as found. A slow-match was arranged to detach postal cards\r\nsuccessively, so that if they were found and mailed, the track of the\r\nballoon could be determined. These balloons at first were called\r\n_ballons perdus_, or lost balloons, but when it was known that most of\r\nthe fourteen balloons liberated from Paris were recovered, the name\r\n_ballons explorateurs_ was given, which was afterwards changed to\r\n_ballons-sondes_, or sounding balloons. The Germans call them,\r\n_Registrir-Ballons_, and in English they have been designated unmanned\r\nballoons also. One of these paper balloons having reached a height of\r\nnearly 30,000 feet, MM. Hermite and BesanÁon proceeded to construct a\r\nballoon of gold-beater's skin, having a capacity of 3960 cubic feet,\r\nin order to carry a better instrumental equipment. The self-recording\r\ninstruments made by the French firm of Richard Brothers were well\r\nadapted for this purpose, and a combined barometer and thermometer,\r\nregistering in ink on an upright drum that is turned by clockwork\r\ninside, is shown in Fig. 5. The exhausted pair of boxes B of the\r\nbarometer actuates the lower pen, while the curved tube C, which is\r\nfilled with alcohol, by its change of shape moves the upper pen and\r\nrecords the temperature. From the indications of the barometer and the\r\ntemperature of the mass of air, it is possible by Laplace's formula to\r\ncalculate the height at any hour of the registration. The balloon\r\nmentioned was the first of the so-called _AÈrophiles_, and when\r\ninflated with coal-gas it could lift seventy-seven pounds besides its\r\nown weight of forty pounds. It carried two of the baro-thermographs\r\ndescribed, and a package of information cards arranged to be detached\r\nby a slow-match. To mitigate the shock of striking the ground one of\r\nthe instruments was hung by rubber cords inside a wicker basket that\r\nin the first ascent was not screened from the sun. It was decided to\r\nliberate these balloons entirely filled with gas (instead of partly\r\nfull, to allow for its expansion), and to utilize all possible\r\nascensional force at first rather than to weight the balloon with an\r\nautomatic discharger of ballast (Fig. 6). The trial of the _AÈrophile_\r\noccurred March 21, 1893, and the next day one of the cards was\r\nreturned announcing its fall in the department of the Yonne, where the\r\nballoon and the instruments were recovered injured. From the blurred\r\ntraces of the latter it was computed that at an altitude of about\r\n49,000 feet a temperature of -60∞ Fahrenheit had been met with, both\r\npressure and temperature being the lowest measured in a balloon up to\r\nthat time. Although the data secured by this ascent were somewhat\r\ndoubtful, yet the feasibility of exploring the atmosphere by\r\n_ballons-sondes_ was proved. It was seen that the enormous velocity of\r\nascent overcame the wind and permitted the path of the balloon to the\r\nsummit of its trajectory to be followed, the balloon appearing like a\r\nmeteor visible in daylight, and so its height could be calculated by\r\ntrigonometrical measurements; while the descent, caused by the escape\r\nand cooling of the gas, was gentle and regular, permitting the\r\ndelicate instruments to be recovered uninjured.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Baro-thermograph of Richard.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 6.--The _AÈrophile_ rising. The left-hand\r\n   picture shows the deformation caused by the resistance of the\r\n   air to its rapid ascent, and the right-hand one the violent\r\n   oscillations when first liberated.]\r\n\r\nThe second ascent of this _AÈrophile_ was its last, for, after falling\r\nin the Black Forest, it was burned by children. However, M. BesanÁon,\r\nnot discouraged, constructed the _AÈrophile II._ of 6300 cubic feet,\r\nand improved the instruments as experience suggested. The records had\r\noften been interrupted by freezing of the ink, so the pen was replaced\r\nby a needle marking with less friction on smoked paper surrounding the\r\nrecord drum. To avoid heating of the thermometers by the sun, they\r\nwere placed in a wicker cylinder open at both ends and covered with\r\nbright metallic paper. This was hung below the balloon with its axis\r\nvertical, in order that the draught through the cylinder when the\r\nballoon was rising or falling should counteract the insolation, and in\r\nthe next ascent, at about the same altitude, a temperature lower by\r\n36∞ Fahrenheit indicated the effect of the protection. To secure an\r\nindependent record of the lowest temperature an ingenious device was\r\nused, consisting of a thermometer tube filled with alcohol and having\r\nblack divisions. The lowest point to which the alcohol sank was\r\nrecorded on photographic paper placed behind the tube, the whole being\r\nenclosed in a metallic box that was automatically closed on striking\r\nthe ground, and so was preserved against the meddling of curious\r\npersons. Up to the middle of 1898 ten voyages had been made by the\r\n_AÈrophiles_, which were now constructed of varnished silk to hold\r\n16,000 cubic feet of gas.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects sought was the collection of samples of air at\r\ngreat heights, but this was not accomplished until recently. In the\r\nfirst apparatus for this purpose, an aneroid barometer at a\r\npredetermined pressure turned the cock communicating with an exhausted\r\nreceiver that filled with air and was then closed. The cock leaked, so\r\nnext the ingenious device of generating heat chemically to seal the\r\nglass tube was tried. This, too, failed, but finally, an apparatus of\r\nM. Cailletet solved the problem. It is advisable to control the height\r\ndeduced from the barometric records by direct observations so long as\r\nthe balloon remains visible, and for this purpose micrometric measures\r\nwere made with a telescope as soon as the balloon left the ground.\r\nThere was also used a species of registering theodolite which, when\r\nkept pointed at the balloon, automatically traced on paper its azimuth\r\nand angular altitude. These records, when combined with the barometric\r\nheight at a known hour, permitted the horizontal distance traversed,\r\nand hence the velocity, to be calculated, or, with two such\r\ninstruments at ends of a base line, the height of the balloon could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments with _ballons-sondes_ in France were soon\r\nrepeated in Germany, where a balloon of rubber-fabric holding 8700\r\ncubic feet was obtained by the German Society for the Promotion of\r\nAÎrial Navigation. When inflated with coal-gas it had a lifting force\r\nof about two hundred and ninety pounds, in excess of its envelope,\r\netc., weighing ninety-three pounds, and the meteorological apparatus\r\nweighing six pounds. The _Cirrus_, as it was called, burst on its\r\nfirst trial, but in July 1894 it made a remarkable voyage from Berlin\r\nto the boundary of Bosnia, a distance of seven hundred miles, at an\r\naverage speed of sixty-two miles an hour. A maximum height of 54,000\r\nfeet and a minimum temperature of -63∞ Fahrenheit were recorded. The\r\n_Cirrus_ on its third voyage was accompanied by manned balloons in\r\norder to have simultaneous observations at different levels, and this\r\ntime it travelled eighty-three miles an hour and rose 61,000 feet. The\r\nlowest temperature of -88∞ Fahrenheit was supposed to be too high, for\r\nthe reason that whereas the ventilation of the thermometers in a\r\nrapidly ascending or descending balloon might be sufficient to\r\ncounteract solar radiation, this would not be the case when the\r\nballoon was approaching its culminating point with a diminishing\r\nspeed. Therefore, Dr. Assmann, under whose supervision the German\r\nexperiments were conducted, employed the thermometer, which in the\r\ncaptive balloon was aspirated electrically, but now was driven by a\r\nweight, and later, because the ink froze, the registration was made\r\nphotographic. The efficacy of the aspirator was seen in the ascent\r\nreferred to, for, when its action stopped, a higher temperature was\r\nrecorded though the balloon continued to ascend. In April 1895 the\r\n_Cirrus_ rose to the extraordinary height of 72,000 feet, or more than\r\nthirteen and a quarter miles, where the barometric pressure was\r\nreduced to one and a half inches of mercury. (In Plate I. this extreme\r\nand possibly excessive height is not shown as the height of the\r\n_ballon-sonde_, but the average of the three highest ascents of the\r\n_Cirrus_ is indicated.) The comparative warmth (-50∞ Fahrenheit)\r\nrecorded has led Dr. Assmann himself to doubt the accuracy of the\r\nusual methods of registering temperature at such extremely low\r\npressures. Plate VII. shows the heights in metres, and the\r\ntemperatures in degrees Centigrade, during eight voyages from Berlin\r\nprior to June 1897.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rivalry and difference of opinion between the\r\nGermans and French as to the methods of exploring the high atmosphere,\r\nthere was also a sincere desire to co-operate, and the International\r\nMeteorological Conference which was held at Paris in September 1896\r\nfurnished an opportunity to make the arrangements. Resolutions were\r\nadopted favouring ascents with manned balloons, as well as\r\nsimultaneous ascents of _ballons-sondes_ in the different countries.\r\nThe successful use of kites at Blue Hill to lift self-recording\r\ninstruments more than a mile into the air led to the wish that similar\r\nexperiments should be tried elsewhere. An International Committee was\r\nappointed to carry out these resolutions, of which Professor Hergesell\r\nof Strassburg is president, and the veteran Parisian aeronaut and\r\njournalist, Wilfrid de Fonvielle, is secretary.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE VII.--HEIGHTS AND TEMPERATURES RECORDED IN\r\n   EIGHT ASCENTS OF THE _CIRRUS_.]\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to make a night ascent and to use identical instruments,\r\nin order that the observations might be made everywhere under the same\r\nconditions. Accordingly, on the early morning of November 14, 1896,\r\nfive balloons manned by observers, and three _ballons-sondes_ with\r\nrecording instruments, were liberated in France, Germany, and Russia.\r\nBy means of the automatic diagrams from the _ballons-sondes_, and the\r\ndirect observations in the manned balloons, it was sought to determine\r\nthe decrease of temperature with height in vertical sections of the\r\natmosphere connecting the various centres from which the balloons\r\nstarted. Seven such sections were available by connecting Paris and\r\nStrassburg, Berlin and St. Petersburg, Warsaw and Munich, etc., but,\r\nunfortunately, observations in the highest strata were generally\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nThree more international ascents were made during the year 1897, which\r\nwere participated in less extensively. At this time it was necessary\r\nto decide questions that had arisen, and to make plans for the future,\r\nconsequently a meeting of the International Committee was held at\r\nStrassburg in 1898. Many technical questions were settled, but the\r\nchief result accomplished was the dissipation of misunderstandings and\r\nprejudices, not only between French and Germans, but between the\r\nGerman representatives themselves, for no doubt personal intercourse\r\nis the greatest good of such conferences. Although it was not a\r\nsurprise, nevertheless it was regretted that no one came from Great\r\nBritain, where, since Glaisher's epoch-making balloon ascensions,\r\nlittle has been done to explore the air. The beneficial results of the\r\nConference were apparent at the fifth international ascent, which\r\noccurred in the early morning of June 8, 1898. Austria and Belgium\r\njoined Germany, France, and Russia, and the field of atmospheric\r\nsurvey was extended over a good part of Europe. A veritable aeronautic\r\nfleet was launched from Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Warsaw, St.\r\nPetersburg, Strassburg, Munich, and Vienna, consisting of twenty-one\r\nballoons, of which thirteen carried observers, who all used the\r\naspiration thermometers, and eight were equipped only with\r\nself-recording instruments. Some of the latter balloons reached\r\naltitudes of 50,000 feet, and the former attained extreme heights of\r\none-third this. On the day selected the atmosphere was in a state of\r\nrepose, with light variable winds, except high up, where they blew, as\r\nis usual, from the west or south-west. These observations were\r\nsufficiently numerous to form a synoptic chart at a considerable\r\nheight above Europe for comparison with the usual chart drawn from the\r\nsurface observations.\r\n\r\nBesides the general work of the International Committee, special\r\ninvestigations have been undertaken by the French, who formed an\r\nAerostatic Commission in Paris. The services of the eminent\r\nphysicists, MM. Cailletet and Violle, have been enlisted, while a\r\ngenerous patron has been found in Prince Roland Bonaparte. The\r\napparatus of M. Cailletet to bring down samples of air from the high\r\nregions may now be described. When the balloon has reached its\r\ngreatest height a cock of special construction, turned by clockwork,\r\nopens and allows the air to enter a reservoir in which a vacuum\r\nexists, and then the cock is automatically and hermetically closed. As\r\nit is known that the balloon reaches its extreme height in about an\r\nhour and a quarter, the time of opening the cock is so regulated, the\r\nclosing taking place a little later by its further rotation. In order\r\nto protect the moving parts from the extreme cold, a receptacle filled\r\nwith fused acetate of soda is placed in the box containing the motor,\r\nso that, notwithstanding the intense cold of the high regions, this\r\nsalt in assuming a crystalline state gives out enough heat during\r\nseveral hours at least. During the ascent of an _AÈrophile_ air was\r\ncollected at 50,000 feet, which when analyzed by M. M¸ntz showed what\r\nwas supposed, viz. that at this altitude the composition of the air\r\ndoes not differ much from that of the lower air. The slight excess of\r\ncarbonic acid found in the upper air might be due to the oxidation of\r\nthe grease used on the cock, and the smaller quantity of oxygen, as\r\ncompared with normal air, might be caused by the absorption of this\r\ngas by the grease or even the absorption by the tinned sides of the\r\ncopper reservoir. By eliminating all possible sources of error in\r\nfuture ascensions, M. M¸ntz thinks that it can be proved whether there\r\nare real differences in the air at different heights, for the methods\r\nof analysis are to-day accurate enough to show such differences if\r\nthey exist. But since it is probable that in the regions which can be\r\nexplored by the _ballons-sondes_, the air undergoes the same mixing\r\nthat renders the lower air nearly uniform, only the smallest\r\nvariations in its composition would naturally be found, requiring\r\nminute precautions against errors. This is no doubt why previous\r\nmeasures agreed in showing the invariable composition of the air at\r\nlower altitudes.\r\n\r\nAnother important contribution of M. Cailletet is an apparatus for\r\nmeasuring the height of the balloon by photography in order to verify\r\nLaplace's formula connecting the barometric pressure with the\r\naltitude. The idea was to replace the observers on the ground, who\r\nsometimes made the trigonometrical measurements of the balloon\r\ndescribed, by a photographic apparatus carried by the balloon itself,\r\nand which at frequent intervals should photograph automatically the\r\nground over which it passed, at the same time that an aneroid\r\nbarometer was photographed on the same sheet. The apparatus is hung\r\nvertically below the balloon; in the lower portion of the box is an\r\nobjective which photographs the ground, and in the upper portion is a\r\nsecond objective which photographs the face of an aneroid barometer\r\nplaced at the proper distance above. A clock-movement makes exposures\r\nevery two minutes, and a sensitive film unrolled between the\r\nobjectives receives the images on each side. If there are known, the\r\nfocal length of the objective, the distance of two points on the\r\nground, and the distance of two points on the photograph, a simple\r\nproportion permits the height of the balloon to be determined at that\r\ntime, and consequently, from the barometric record, the law connecting\r\nthe pressure with height can be deduced. The apparatus was\r\nsuccessfully used in the voyage of a large balloon with observers, and\r\nthe accuracy of the determination of height was found to be within\r\n1/250. If the apparatus is to be used at great heights it would be\r\nnecessary to protect the barometer and the camera from the very low\r\ntemperatures. Besides the use for which it was designed, this\r\napparatus may serve to trace the route of a balloon and to determine\r\nthe horizontal velocity at the different points of its path.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the high atmosphere by _ballons-sondes_, which can\r\naid so many investigations, has been utilized by M. Violle to obtain\r\nactinometric measures, that is, to determine the amount of heat given\r\nby the sun, or what is called the \"solar constant.\" This has been done\r\non mountains with varying results, due to the changing amount of\r\natmospheric absorption. In regions traversed by the balloon where the\r\npressure of the air is reduced to a few inches of mercury, where there\r\nis a complete absence of water-vapour, and at heights to which\r\nterrestrial dust does not extend, the measure of the quantity of heat\r\nsent by the sun towards the earth is freed from almost all the errors\r\nwhich we encounter on its surface. The actinometer of M. Violle is, in\r\nprinciple, a sphere of copper, blackened externally, and having inside\r\na thermometric apparatus which registers some distance away. Under the\r\naction of the solar rays the sphere is heated, and assumes equilibrium\r\nwhen the loss by radiation and by contact with the air compensates for\r\nthe gain by the absorption of the direct heat. While at low levels the\r\natmosphere also contributes to heat the sphere, at great heights the\r\nsun shines from an almost black sky and alone heats the sphere. Since\r\nthe balloon follows the wind the apparatus is protected from air\r\ncurrents which would otherwise introduce errors. Each twenty minutes a\r\nscreen cuts off the solar rays from the sphere so that it cools to\r\nthe temperature of the air, which is also recorded. On account of its\r\nweight this apparatus has not yet been carried by a _ballon-sonde_,\r\nbut it has operated successfully in a balloon with observers.\r\n\r\nM. Teisserenc de Bort, who is actively engaged in exploring the air\r\nfrom a meteorological standpoint, has constructed a very sensitive\r\nthermometer made of a blade of German silver set in a frame of\r\nnickel-steel that does not expand with heat. This may be ventilated by\r\na fan, and, while extremely sensitive to changes of temperature, it is\r\nnot affected by shocks, and consequently is well adapted for use in\r\n_ballons-sondes_ that pass rapidly through air-strata of varying\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the development of the _ballons-sondes_ it is\r\nevident that they offer possibilities of obtaining data in the high\r\natmosphere, perhaps up to fifteen miles or more, which, though subject\r\nto inaccuracies, are of great interest to the physicist and\r\nastronomer. The meteorologist is chiefly concerned with that portion\r\nof the atmosphere which lies within two or three miles of the earth,\r\nand he requires, moreover, accurate measurements for his conclusions.\r\nThe new and most satisfactory way of obtaining these data is by kites,\r\nand the remaining chapters will treat of this method of exploring the\r\natmosphere and the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n   KITES--HISTORY AND APPLICATION TO METEOROLOGICAL PURPOSES AT\r\n   BLUE HILL AND ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nKites are supposed to have been invented four hundred years before the\r\nChristian era by Archytas, and at Smyrna the flying of kites remains a\r\nnational sport to this day. We are told that two hundred years later,\r\na Chinese general, Han Sin, employed kites as a means of communication\r\nwith the garrison of a besieged town, and there is a legend about\r\ntheir use in Japan to dislodge and carry away a golden ornament from a\r\ntower. Whatever may be the truth of these stories, we know that\r\nkite-flying in the Malay Archipelago, in China, and in Japan, has been\r\na pastime for all classes during centuries, and that the Asiatic\r\npeople have always been the expert kite-fliers of the world.\r\n\r\nKites with tails seem to have been introduced into England about two\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, and Isaac Newton when a school-boy made\r\nsome improvements in them. Notwithstanding the fact that generations\r\nof boys have flown kites and so eminent a mathematician as Euler\r\ninvestigated their theory, until recently kites remained toys unsuited\r\nfor practical purposes. Since the tailless kite has become a familiar\r\nobject, it has been said facetiously that kites lost their tails by\r\nthe same process of evolution which deprived man of his caudal\r\nappendage; but as kites without tails have been flown in Asia for\r\ncenturies, the truth is that the tailed kites were the ones first\r\nbrought to Europe as playthings. To-day in Holland we see boys flying\r\nthe English bow-kite and the common kite with crossed sticks, both of\r\nwhich require tails, and by the side of them tailless kites imported\r\nfrom the Dutch colonies in Java. Fig. 7 represents a kite from the\r\neast coast of Java, drawn from a model in a museum at Amsterdam, and\r\nalso a drawing of a Chinese bird-kite in the National Museum at\r\nWashington. Like most of the oriental kites, they are made flat, but\r\nwhen exposed to the wind the extremities of the wings, which have a\r\nframe of split bamboo, bend backward, securing in this way the\r\nstability which in our common flat kite is gained by the action of the\r\ntail in lowering the centre of gravity and in maintaining the\r\ninclination to the wind.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Oriental tailless Kites.]\r\n\r\nFrom historical researches that have been stimulated by the recent\r\npractical applications of kites, it appears that their first use for\r\nscientific purposes was in 1749, when Dr. Alexander Wilson of Glasgow,\r\nand his pupil, Thomas Melvill, used kites to lift thermometers. Their\r\nkites, from four to seven feet in height, and covered with paper, were\r\nfastened behind one another, each kite taking up as much line as could\r\nbe supported, thereby allowing its companion to soar to an elevation\r\nproportionally higher. It is related that \"the uppermost one ascended\r\nto an amazing height, disappearing at times among the white summer\r\nclouds, whilst all the rest, in a series, formed with it in the air\r\nbelow such a lofty scale, and that too affected by such regular and\r\nconspiring motions, as at once changed a boyish pastime into a\r\nspectacle which greatly interested every beholder.... To obtain the\r\ninformation they wanted they contrived that thermometers, properly\r\nsecured, and having bushy tassels of paper tied to them, should be let\r\nfall at stated periods from some of the higher kites, which was\r\naccomplished by the gradual singeing of a match-line.\" How the\r\nthermometers were prevented from changing their readings while falling\r\nto the ground is not explained. The account concludes: \"When engaged\r\nin these experiments, though now and then they communicated\r\nimmediately with the clouds, yet, as this happened always in fine\r\nweather, no symptoms whatever of an electrical nature came under their\r\nobservation. The sublime analysis of the thunderbolt, and of the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere, lay yet entirely undiscovered, and was\r\nreserved two years longer for the sagacity of the celebrated Dr.\r\nFranklin.\" Hence it seems that Franklin's famous experiment of\r\ncollecting the electricity of a thunder-cloud by means of a kite,\r\nperformed at Philadelphia in 1752, was not its first scientific\r\napplication, and therefore America can claim only the later and most\r\nremarkable development of this means of exploring the air.\r\n\r\nAbout 1837 there existed in Philadelphia an organization called the\r\nFranklin Kite Club that flew kites for recreation. Espy, the eminent\r\nmeteorologist, was a member, and he states \"that on those days when\r\ncolumnar clouds form rapidly and numerously the kite was frequently\r\ncarried upward nearly perpendicularly by columns of ascending air,\" a\r\nphenomenon which is often observed to-day. Espy calculated the height\r\nat which clouds should form by the cooling of the air to its\r\ndew-point, and then employed kites to verify his calculations of the\r\nheights of the clouds. It will be remembered that both these methods\r\nare utilized in the measurements of cloud-heights at Blue Hill. Kites\r\nwere employed to get temperatures a hundred or more feet above the\r\nArctic ocean early in the present century, and in 1847 W. R. Birt flew\r\na kite at Kew Observatory, with which he hoped to obtain measures of\r\ntemperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc. This kite, hexagonal in\r\nshape, required three divergent strings attached to the ground to keep\r\nit steady, and the instruments were to be hoisted up to the kite by a\r\npulley.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first person to soar aloft on a kite was a lady, who, more\r\nthan fifty years ago, was lifted some hundred feet by a great kite\r\nconstructed by George Pocock, an Englishman, to serve as an aÎrial\r\nobservatory in warfare, and also to drag carriages along the ground.\r\nIt was proposed afterwards to make use of kites in shipwrecks to take\r\npersons or life-lines ashore, and in 1865 Sir George Nares invented a\r\nstorm-kite, so called, with a tail made up of hollow cones. This form\r\nof tail, subsequently used for both kites and balloons, is very\r\nefficient, since it offers increasing resistance as the wind becomes\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Mr. Douglas Archibald in England revived the use of kites for\r\nmeteorological observations, and outlined a comprehensive scheme of\r\nexploring the air with kites which included almost all that has been\r\ndone since, but his actual work, performed during the next three\r\nyears, was limited to ascertaining the increase of wind velocity with\r\nheight. To do this, he attached registering anemometers at four\r\ndifferent points on the kite-wire, but since the total wind movements\r\nonly were registered from the time the anemometers left the ground\r\nuntil they returned, it was impossible to obtain simultaneous records\r\nnear the ground and at the kite, as is done to-day. Still, Archibald\r\ngot differential measurements of the velocity of the wind up to the\r\nheight of 1200 feet. The kites he employed were diamond-shaped,\r\ncovered with silk, and were flown tandem, with the hollow cones,\r\nalready mentioned, attached to the tails. Although copper and iron\r\nwire had been used for flying kites many years before, yet Archibald\r\nwas the first to substitute steel pianoforte wire for the string,\r\nthereby increasing the strength while diminishing the weight, size,\r\nand cost of the line. Mr. Archibald in 1887 took the first photograph\r\nfrom a kite, a method which MM. Batut and Wenz developed in France,\r\nand Messrs. Eddy and Woglom in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent progress of kite-flying for meteorological purposes has\r\ntaken place in the last-named country, and may be chronologically\r\nstated as follows: in 1885 Mr. Alexander McAdie (later of the U. S.\r\nWeather Bureau) repeated Franklin's kite experiment on Blue Hill, with\r\nthe addition of an electrometer; in 1891, and again in 1892, he\r\nmeasured simultaneously the electric potential at the base of Blue\r\nHill, on the hill, and with kites as collectors several hundred feet\r\nabove the hill-top, about the same time that Dr. Weber, in Breslau,\r\nGermany, was making a more extensive use of kites for the same\r\npurpose. It was no doubt William A. Eddy of Bayonne, N. J., who turned\r\nthe attention of American scientific men to kite-flying, and created\r\nthe widespread interest in kites which exists to-day. About 1890 Mr.\r\nEddy lifted thermometers with an ordinary kite, but soon afterwards\r\ndevised a tailless kite, resembling the Java kite except that the\r\nhorizontal cross-piece is nearer the top of the vertical stick, and\r\nits ends are bent backward in a bow and connected by a cord. This kite\r\nstarts upward on being held in the wind at the end of a taut line, and\r\ncontinues to rise until the increasing wind-pressure on the portion\r\nabove the cross-stick balances the pressure on the larger lower\r\nportion. The kite is kept from falling to one side by the looseness of\r\nthe covering on either side of the backbone, and if there is more\r\nmaterial on one side than on the other, or if the covering is too\r\ntight to form pockets in the wind, the kite requires a tail.[1]\r\n\r\n   [1] A tail will prevent any kite from turning over, or \"diving,\"\r\n       because its weight keeps the lower end down while the\r\n       pressure of the wind on the tail also pulls the lower end\r\n       backward and maintains the necessary angle of the kite to the\r\n       wind, the most efficient angle being about 22 degrees. Bending\r\n       back the ends of the cross-stick gives stability to a kite\r\n       because, when, on account of the eddies in the wind, a stronger\r\n       pressure is exerted on one side of the kite, this side is\r\n       driven backward, thereby presenting less effective surface to\r\n       the wind, while as the other side comes forward more nearly at\r\n       right angles to the wind, it receives greater pressure than\r\n       before. In this way the equilibrium about the central stick is\r\n       automatically maintained, the required inclination to the wind\r\n       being secured by the greater surface presented to the wind\r\n       below the point of attachment of the bridle.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Mr. Eddy lifted a minimum thermometer by several of these\r\nkites flown tandem, and proposed to obtain in this way data to\r\nforecast the weather. In the _Proceedings of the Aeronautical\r\nConference_, held in connection with the Chicago Exposition, Prof. M.\r\nW. Harrington, then Chief of the U. S. Weather Bureau, quoted Mr.\r\nEddy's estimate of the cost of exploring the air by means of kites\r\nflown in series, and advocated their use.\r\n\r\nUp to this time it does not appear that self-recording\r\ninstruments--that is to say, those which make continuous graphic\r\nrecords--had been raised by kites. In the days of the early\r\nexperimenters such instruments were too heavy and cumbersome to be\r\nlifted by the more or less unmanageable kites, but within the past few\r\nyears M. Richard of Paris has made the simple and light recording\r\ninstruments described in connection with balloons, which can be\r\nattached to kites. In this way it is possible to obtain simultaneous\r\nrecords at the kite and at a station on the ground, and from them to\r\nstudy the differences of temperature and humidity, and this seems to\r\nhave been done first at Blue Hill Observatory. In August 1894 Mr. Eddy\r\nbrought his kites to Blue Hill and with them lifted a Richard\r\nthermograph, which had been partly reconstructed of aluminium by Mr.\r\nFergusson so that it weighed but 1-1/4 lbs., to the height of 1500\r\nfeet, and so the earliest automatic record of temperature was obtained\r\nby a kite. During the next summer, Mr. Eddy assisted again in the\r\nexperiments at Blue Hill, and secured photographs of the Observatory\r\nand the hill by a camera carried between his kites to the height of a\r\nhundred feet or more.\r\n\r\nNow that the possibility of lifting self-recording meteorological\r\ninstruments to considerable heights had been demonstrated, an\r\ninvestigation of the thermal and hygrometric conditions of the free\r\nair was undertaken by the staff of the Blue Hill Observatory, who had\r\nalready made an investigation of the movements of the clouds by the\r\nmethods described in the second chapter.\r\n\r\nThe development of the kite and its accessory apparatus, and the\r\nacquisition of the knowledge how to use them, required much time, and\r\nresulted in the damage or loss of many kites. Two meteorographs, as\r\nthe combination of two or more self-recording instruments is called,\r\nwere dropped from a great height and no trace of them was found. When,\r\nhowever, by the breaking of the line both kites and instrument are\r\ncarried away, the kites act as a parachute and bear the instrument\r\ngently to the ground, where both are usually recovered uninjured; to\r\nfacilitate their return should they fall at a distance, the name and\r\naddress are marked on each. It would be tedious to relate the ups and\r\ndowns of scientific kite-flying at Blue Hill before the wind was\r\nsuccessfully harnessed to the service of science, and the kites were\r\nprevented from kicking over the traces, or from breaking away, so only\r\na brief account of the progress of the work will be given, and then\r\nthe methods at present used will be described. At first the Eddy, or\r\nMalay kites, as they are also called, covered with paper or with\r\nvarnished cloth, were coupled tandem to secure greater safety and\r\nlifting power. The principle of attaching kites at several points on\r\nthe line was early adopted at Blue Hill, for although it can be\r\ndemonstrated theoretically that a greater height is possible by\r\nconcentrating all the pull at the end of the line, yet in the case of\r\na line which is not infinitely strong the best results are got by\r\ndistributing the pull, and in this way, too, kites can be added as the\r\nwind conditions aloft warrant. To obviate the frequent breaking of the\r\nbowed cross-piece, Mr. Fergusson made it in two pieces, each being\r\nheld in a metal socket on the central stick, the two pieces forming a\r\ndihedral angle towards the wind. It had the advantage also of being\r\nreadily taken apart for transportation. This kite, shown in Fig. 8,\r\nflew at a high angle above the horizon and through a considerable\r\nrange of wind velocity, but it could not be kept permanently in\r\nbalance, or made to adjust itself to great variations in wind\r\nvelocity, and therefore it was discarded.\r\n\r\nThe first meteorograph, a combined recording thermometer and barometer\r\n(from which the height can be calculated), was constructed by Mr.\r\nFergusson in August 1895, and three months later he united a recording\r\nanemometer to the thermometer, which was probably the first apparatus\r\nof this kind to be attached to kites. A meteorograph, recording the\r\natmospheric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity, was\r\nordered from M. Richard of Paris in 1895, like one already carried by\r\nFrench aeronauts, except that, since for kites lightness is\r\nall-essential, M. Richard constructed this triple-recorder for the\r\nfirst time of aluminium, and hereby reduced its weight to 2-4/5 lbs.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Eddy tailless Kite.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Hargrave Kite.]\r\n\r\nOne of these meteorographs was hung to a ring at the point of\r\nattachment of the two kite-lines to the main line, a method which was\r\nused until recently. In August 1895, besides the Eddy kites, there was\r\nfirst used the cellular or box kite, invented by Lawrence Hargrave of\r\nSydney, Australia, which bears no resemblance to the conventional\r\nforms of kites and which it would not be supposed could fly. As seen\r\nfrom Fig. 9 its appearance is that of two light boxes without tops or\r\nbottoms, fastened some distance above each other. The wind exerts its\r\nlifting force chiefly upon the front and rear sides of the top box,\r\nthe lower box, which inclines to the rear, and so receives less\r\npressure, preserving the balance. The ends of the boxes, being in line\r\nwith the wind, keep the kite steady and serve the purpose of the\r\ndihedral angle in the Malay kite. The Japanese are said to fly a\r\nsingle box, which is the prototype of the Hargrave double cell.\r\n\r\nAt the present time some form of the Hargrave kite is generally\r\nemployed for scientific purposes. On account of the weight of the\r\nlarge cord necessary to control these kites, and the surface which it\r\npresented to the wind, a height of 2000 feet could not be reached, so,\r\nduring the winter of 1895-6, following Archibald's example and the\r\nmethods of deep-sea sounding employed by Captain Sigsbee, U. S. N.,\r\nsteel pianoforte wire was substituted for the cord. This wire is less\r\nthan half as heavy, and less than one-fourth the size of cord having\r\nthe same strength, and, moreover, its surface is polished, which\r\nreduces the friction of the wind blowing past it. With the wire the\r\nheight of a mile was reached in July, and a mile and two-thirds above\r\nBlue Hill in October 1896.\r\n\r\nUp to this time a reel turned by two men sufficed to draw down the\r\nkites, but the increasing pull and length of wire made recourse to\r\nsteam-power necessary. In January 1897 a grant of money was allotted\r\nfrom the Hodgkins Fund of the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose\r\nof obtaining meteorological records at heights exceeding ten thousand\r\nfeet, and no doubt the first application of steam to kite-flying was\r\nthe winch built by Mr. Fergusson with ingenious devices for\r\ndistributing, oiling, and measuring the length of wire. The cumulative\r\npressure of the successive coils of wire finally crushed the drum, and\r\nthe next apparatus applied the principle of Sir William Thomson's\r\ndeep-sea sounding apparatus, in which there is no accumulation of\r\npressure. In October 1897 records were brought down from eleven\r\nthousand feet, or a thousand feet above the prescribed height.\r\n\r\nThe kites and apparatus at present employed at Blue Hill will now be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe kites are all of the multiplane type, and mostly of Hargrave's\r\nconstruction with two rectangular cells. These cells are covered with\r\ncloth or silk, except at their tops and bottoms, and one is secured\r\nabove the other by four or more sticks. The wooden frames are as light\r\nas possible, but are made rigid by guys of steel wire that bind them\r\nin all directions. The average weight is about two ounces a square\r\nfoot of lifting surface, which is about the same weight a square foot\r\nas the Eddy kites when all the surface is included in the estimate.\r\nThe largest of the Hargrave kites stands nine feet high, weighs eleven\r\npounds, and contains ninety square feet of lifting surface, which in\r\nthe recent kites is arched, resembling the curvature of a bird's\r\nwings, a construction that was proposed many years ago by Phillips\r\n(Fig. 10). These curved surfaces increase the lift, or upward pull,\r\nmore than the drift, or motion to leeward, and so the angular\r\nelevation is augmented without materially adding to the total pull on\r\nthe wire, which should not exceed one-half its breaking strength.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Modified Hargrave Kite at\r\n   Blue Hill.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important factor in the success of the Blue Hill work\r\nwas the invention by Mr. Clayton of the regulating bridle which is\r\napplied to every kite. An elastic cord is inserted in the lower part\r\nof the bridle, to which the flying-line is attached, and when the\r\nwind-pressure increases this cord stretches, and causes the kite to\r\ndiminish its angle of incidence to the wind until the gust subsides. A\r\nkite can be set to pull only a fixed amount in the strongest wind,\r\nwhen the kite will fly nearly horizontal. We are therefore able to\r\ncalculate the greatest pull which can be exerted on the wire by all\r\nthe kites. With this device the kites have flown through gales of\r\nfifty or sixty miles an hour without breaking loose or injuring\r\nthemselves. Another efficient kite which has been used at Blue Hill is\r\nthe so-called \"aero-curve kite\" made by Mr. C. H. Lamson of Portland,\r\nMaine. As is seen from Fig. 11, this kite resembles a soaring bird,\r\nand it can be taken apart and folded up for storage or transportation.\r\n\r\nIn general, the angle of the flying lines of the Blue Hill kites is\r\n50∞ or 60∞ above the horizon, and in winds of twenty miles an hour the\r\npull on the line is about one pound for each square foot of lifting\r\nsurface in the kite. Kites can be raised in a wind that blows more\r\nthan twelve miles an hour at the ground, and as the average velocity\r\nof the wind for the year on Blue Hill is eighteen miles an hour, the\r\ndays are few when kites will not fly there.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Lamson's Aero-curve Kite.]\r\n\r\nThe wire to which the kites are attached is steel music-wire, 32/1000\r\nof an inch in diameter, weighing fifteen pounds a mile, and capable of\r\nwithstanding a pull of three hundred pounds. The wire is spliced in\r\nlengths of more than a mile with the greatest care, special pains\r\nbeing taken that no sharp bends or rust-spots occur which would cause\r\nit to break. To lift the increasing weight of wire, kites are\r\nattached at intervals of a few thousand feet, so that the angle may be\r\nmaintained as high as is consistent with a safe pull, and this is done\r\nby screwing on the wire aluminium clamps, to which the kite-lines are\r\nfastened. On account of the greater stability and strength of the new\r\nkites, the meteorograph is suspended directly from the top kite. The\r\nRichard meteorograph, contained in an aluminium cage of about a foot\r\ncube, weighs less than three pounds, and it is only necessary to\r\nscreen the thermometer from the sun's rays to obtain the true\r\ntemperature of the air, since the wind insures a circulation of air\r\naround the thermometer. Another meteorograph, constructed by Mr.\r\nFergusson, records the velocity of the wind in addition to the three\r\nother elements, and it weighs no more than the French instrument.\r\n\r\nThe reeling apparatus is an example of how the same apparatus may\r\nserve diametrically opposite purposes. In sounding the deep sea the\r\nwire must be pulled upwards, whereas in sounding the heights of the\r\natmosphere the wire must be pulled in the reverse direction. Therefore\r\nthe deep-sea sounding apparatus has been altered by Mr. Fergusson to\r\npull obliquely downwards, the wire passing over a swivelling pulley\r\nwhich follows its direction and registers on a dial the exact length\r\nunreeled. Next the wire bears against a pulley carried by a strong\r\nspiral spring, by which the pull upon it at all times is recorded on a\r\npaper-covered drum turned by clockwork. The wire passes now several\r\ntimes around a strain-pulley, and finally is coiled under slight\r\ntension upon a large storage-drum. When the kites are to be pulled\r\ndown, the strain-pulley is connected with a two-horse-power\r\nsteam-engine, and the wire is drawn in at a speed of from three to six\r\nmiles an hour; but when the kites are rising the belt is removed, and\r\nthe pull of the kites unreels the wire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Meteorograph lifted by Kites\r\n   at Blue Hill.]\r\n\r\nThe method of making a kite-flight for meteorological purposes at Blue\r\nHill is as follows: a kite, fastened by a long wire to the ring in the\r\nmain wire, being in the air, and the meteorograph suspended, another\r\nkite is attached to the ring by a shorter cord (Fig. 12). They are\r\nthen allowed to rise, and to unreel the wire, until its angle with the\r\nhorizon becomes low, when, by means of the clamps described, other\r\nkites are added, the number depending on the size of the kites and the\r\nstrength of the wind. After a pause at the highest attainable\r\naltitude, the winch is connected with the steam-engine and the kites\r\nare drawn down. The pauses at the highest point, and when kites are\r\nattached or detached, are necessary to allow the recording instruments\r\nto acquire the conditions of the surrounding air; and because at\r\nthese times the meteorograph is nearly stationary, measurements of its\r\nangular elevation are made with a surveyor's transit, while\r\nobservations of azimuth give the direction of the wind at the\r\ndifferent heights. The time of making each angular measurement is\r\nnoted, so that the corresponding point on the trace of the\r\nmeteorograph may be found. From the length of the wire and its\r\nvertical angle, the height of the meteorograph can be calculated, it\r\nhaving been found that the sag of the wire, or its deviation either in\r\na vertical or a horizontal plane from the straight line joining the\r\nkite and the reel, does not cause an error exceeding three per cent.\r\nin the height so computed. When the meteorograph is hidden by clouds,\r\nthe height above the last point trigonometrically determined is\r\ncomputed from the barometer record by Laplace's formula. At night\r\nthere is only the barometer from which to determine the height; for\r\nalthough an attempt was made to use a lantern to sight upon, yet it\r\nsoon became invisible, or, when seen, was confounded with the stars.\r\nBefore and after the flight the meteorograph is hung upon a tripod in\r\nthe free air, in order that its thermometer and hygrometer may be\r\ncompared with the standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIGHTS ABOVE SEA-LEVEL OF KITE-FLIGHTS.\r\n\r\n(_Blue Hill is 630 feet above the sea_)\r\n\r\n ----+----+----------------++-------------------------------------------\r\n     | No.|Heights in Feet ||        Percentages of Records above\r\n Year| of +-------+--------++-------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n     |Rec-|Mean of|Absolute|| 500 m.| 1000 m.| 1500 m.| 2000 m.| 3000 m.\r\n     |ords|Maximum|Maximum || (1640 |  (3280 |  (4920 |  (6560 |  (9840\r\n     |    |       |        ||  ft.) |   ft.) |   ft.) |   ft.) |   ft.)\r\n ----+----+-------+--------++-------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n 1894|  2 | 1,860 |  2,070 ||   50  |    0   |     0  |     0  |    0\r\n 1895| 28 | 1,673 |  2,490 ||   59  |    0   |     0  |     0  |    0\r\n 1896| 86 | 2,772 |  9,327 ||   78  |   28   |     9  |     4  |    0\r\n 1897| 38 | 4,557 | 11,716 ||   95  |   68   |    45  |    21  |    5\r\n 1898| 35 | 7,350 | 12,070 ||  100  |   92   |    80  |    66  |   20\r\n ----+----+-------+--------++-------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the use of wire and more efficient kites, the heights have been\r\ngreatly increased. Thus the average height above the hill attained by\r\nthe meteorograph in thirty-five flights made during 1898 was more than\r\na mile and a quarter, whereas the average height of all the ascents\r\nprior to 1897 was about a quarter of a mile (see Table). The average\r\nheight of the meteorograph above the hill, in all the flights during\r\nAugust 1898, was nearly a mile and a half, and on August 26 the\r\nmeteorograph was raised 360 feet higher than ever before, its\r\naltitude, determined trigonometrically, being 11,440 feet above Blue\r\nHill, or 12,070 feet above the neighbouring ocean. The meteorograph\r\nwas suspended from the topmost kite, one of the Lamson pattern, having\r\n71 square feet of lifting surface, and this was increased to a total\r\nof 149 square feet by four kites of the modified Hargrave type, that\r\nwere attached at intervals to the wire. The five miles of wire in the\r\nair weighed 75 lbs., and the total weight including kites and\r\napparatus was 112 lbs. The meteorograph left the ground at 10:40 a.m.,\r\nattained its greatest height at 4:15 p.m., and returned to the ground\r\nat 8:40 p.m., a feat which it would be difficult for a man to equal on\r\na mountain. The cumulus clouds were traversed three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the earth, and above them the air was found to be very dry. On\r\nthe hill the air temperature was 72∞, when it was 38∞ in the free air\r\n11,440 feet above, and the wind velocity increased from twenty-two to\r\nforty miles an hour. These figures give an idea of the change of\r\natmospheric conditions which occurs, but the conclusions deduced from\r\nthe Blue Hill kite-flights will be discussed in the next chapter.\r\nHowever, the phenomena of atmospheric electricity, which have become\r\nnoticeable since the use of wire, may be described here. Generally,\r\nwhenever the kites rise above seventeen hundred feet, the wire becomes\r\nstrongly charged with electricity, and when the great heights are\r\nreached the electricity is discharged in long and brilliant sparks at\r\nthe reel, often to the inconvenience of the attendants. Usually, the\r\nelectrical potential increases with altitude, and it is greatest\r\nduring snow-storms or when the conditions favour thunder-storms.\r\nNotwithstanding its intensity, the quantity of electricity in the\r\natmosphere is probably insufficient to make its collection and\r\nstorage for practical purposes worth while.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that kite-flying for meteorological purposes\r\nis a sinecure. At Blue Hill about two hundred flights have been made\r\nin all seasons and in all weathers, with temperatures varying from\r\n-5∞ to +90∞, in gales, in rain, and in snow-storms, though not in\r\nthunder-storms. Sometimes the kites are invisible from almost the time\r\nthey leave the earth until their return, but when the upper kites are\r\nvisible it is necessary to observe them with theodolites every few\r\nminutes. Remembering that a high flight occupies ten or twelve hours,\r\nand frequently terminates late at night, or even continues until\r\nmorning, it will be obvious that the work requires skill, energy, and\r\nperseverance, which have been shown by my assistants at the Blue Hill\r\nObservatory who have conducted the flights.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, for lack of wind or from breakage of the line, the kites\r\nfall to the ground, usually intact. If they were visible,\r\ntrigonometrical measurements on the hill enable the place of descent\r\nto be located, and then the kites and meteorograph are sent for and\r\nthe wire is reeled up. But at night, or when clouds hide the kites,\r\nthe direction in which they fall is not known, because the azimuth of\r\nthe wire at the reel often differs from that of the kites; so last\r\nautumn several hundred miles of road, path, wood, and swamp were\r\ntraversed before the aÎrial apparatus, which had been lost during a\r\nflight at night, was found comparatively close at hand.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be evident that a former toy has been\r\nproved to be of the greatest importance for meteorological\r\ninvestigation at the Blue Hill Observatory. On account of the success\r\nthere attained it is coming into use elsewhere for meteorological\r\nobservations. In 1898 the United States Weather Bureau created\r\nseventeen kite stations, chiefly in the Mississippi Valley, with the\r\nintention of obtaining data every day, at the height of a mile or\r\nmore, with which to plot a synoptic weather map similar to the map\r\nthat is now drawn from the data at the ground. From a knowledge of the\r\nweather conditions prevailing simultaneously in the upper and lower\r\nair, it was expected that the weather forecasts could be improved, but\r\nunfortunately, on account of the light winds during the summer, it was\r\nimpossible to make enough simultaneous kite-flights to construct the\r\nupper-air map, and therefore the scheme was abandoned. However, the\r\ndata obtained will no doubt furnish valuable information about the\r\nvertical temperature gradient, etc., in various conditions of weather.\r\nThe chief meteorological bureaus of Germany and Russia are equipping\r\nstations with kites and balloons, and M. Teisserenc de Bort, who has\r\nprovided his private observatory near Paris with kite apparatus of the\r\nBlue Hill type, has already reached high altitudes. In Scotland too,\r\nwhich was the birthplace of scientific kite-flying, experiments have\r\nbeen resumed by a Scotchman and an American--a happy union of forces.\r\n\r\nFrom these preparations it appears that the resolution of the\r\nInternational Aeronautical Conference, recommending that all central\r\nobservatories should employ this method of investigation as being of\r\nprime importance for the advancement of meteorological knowledge, is\r\nbeing carried out, and seems likely to produce important results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n   RESULTS OF THE KITE-FLIGHTS AT BLUE HILL--FUTURE WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nKites possess several advantages over other methods of exploring the\r\nair up to heights of at least 12,000 feet whenever there is wind, but\r\ntheir chief merit is, that with them the true conditions of the air\r\nmay be ascertained. The disadvantages of other methods of exploring\r\nthe air, as compared with kites, are these:\r\n\r\n1. =Mountains= not only affect by contact the adjacent air, but by\r\ndeflecting the air-currents cause mixture and ascent, which give\r\nconditions differing widely from those of the free air.\r\n\r\n2. =Free Balloons= are more or less surrounded by heated or stagnant\r\nair, because they drift with the wind, and on account of the\r\nsluggishness of the thermometers, the temperatures observed at a given\r\nheight in a balloon are generally higher during the ascent, _i.e._\r\nwhen passing from warm to cold air, than during the descent, when the\r\nconditions are reversed. Again, it is not possible to study the\r\nprogressive changes in the atmospheric conditions at one place,\r\nbecause observations in a drifting balloon are not comparable with\r\nsimultaneous ones made at a station on the ground below. With kites,\r\nhowever, the possibility of making frequent and nearly vertical\r\nascents and descents permits observations to be obtained almost\r\nsimultaneously in superincumbent strata of air. The height of the kite\r\ncan usually be determined with an accuracy not attainable by the\r\nbarometer in a balloon.\r\n\r\n3. =Captive Balloons=, although constructed so as not to be driven\r\ndown by wind, cannot rise nearly so high as kites on account of the\r\nweight and resistance of the cable necessary to control them, and even\r\nthe German kite-balloon, on account of its large surface, would hardly\r\nwithstand the strong winds in which kites can fly.\r\n\r\n4. =The Cost= of installing and operating either mountain stations or\r\nballoons is much greater than for kites.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the lower two miles of air with kites flown from\r\nBlue Hill is no doubt the most complete ever made at one place. Nearly\r\ntwo hundred records have been obtained in all kinds of weather\r\nconditions, and the progressive attainment of greater and greater\r\nheights is shown in the table in the preceding chapter. The records\r\nfrom the flights have been discussed by Mr. Clayton; those until\r\nFebruary 1897, with the Blue Hill Observations, in Vol. xlii., Part I.,\r\nof the _Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College_,\r\nand later records in two _Bulletins_ of the Blue Hill Observatory, in\r\nwhich the changes of temperature and humidity with height, and their\r\nrelation to the positions of cyclones and anti-cyclones, are\r\ninvestigated. The use of kites for weather predicting, as was said,\r\nhas been tried by the United States Weather Bureau, but it is certain\r\nthat further studies, such as have been made on Blue Hill, are\r\nnecessary before the sequence of the conditions at the earth's surface\r\nto the phenomena observed in the upper air is definitely known, so that\r\nthe latter can be utilized in forecasting.\r\n\r\nSome of the deductions from the observations with kites at Blue Hill\r\nfollow. Plate VIII. is a facsimile of the record of the\r\nbaro-thermo-hygrograph during two flights on October 8, 1896, when for\r\nthe first time the height of a mile and a half was attained. The\r\nrecord-sheet, it may be said, is wrapped around a cylinder that turns\r\non its axis in twelve hours, and the curved lines in each of the three\r\nhorizontal sections divide them into quarter hours. The lower section\r\ncontains the trace of the barometer, the horizontal lines being the\r\nheights in metres and feet that correspond to the barometric\r\npressure with a temperature of 32∞ Fahrenheit; in the middle section\r\nis the trace of the hygrometer on a scale of relative humidity in\r\npercentages, and in the upper section is the trace of the thermometer\r\non a scale of temperatures in Fahrenheit and Centigrade degrees. It\r\nwill be observed that the record of the barometer is reversed, _i.e._\r\nthe trace rises for falling pressure, and in the second flight when\r\nthe unexpected height of 8697 feet above Blue Hill was reached, the\r\nlimit of the altitude scale was exceeded.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE VIII.--METEOROGRAM FROM THE KITE-FLIGHT OF\r\n   OCT. 8, 1896, AT BLUE HILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to study the changes of these elements with height during the\r\nhigher flight, in Plate IX., Figs. 4 and 5, the temperature and\r\nhumidity of the automatic record are plotted as abscissÊ, with the\r\nheights above sea-level in metres as ordinates. For those not familiar\r\nwith this unit of length, it may be said that 100 metres are about 330\r\nfeet, and that 1600 metres equal one mile approximately. When the\r\nmeteorograph was ascending, dots indicate the recorded temperatures\r\nand humidities, which are each connected respectively by continuous\r\nlines; when the meteorograph was descending, crosses indicate the\r\nobservations, which are connected by broken lines. Lines inclining\r\nupwards to the left indicate decreasing temperature and humidity with\r\nincrease of height, and lines inclining to the right increasing\r\ntemperature and humidity with height. The straight dotted lines show\r\nthe adiabatic decrease of temperature for ascending dry air. The\r\nascent was made during the warmest part of the day, and the descent\r\nfor the most part after sunset. The two branches of the\r\ntemperature-lines typify the temperature change with height which\r\nusually occurs in fair weather during the day and the night\r\nrespectively. The continuous line, representing the day observations,\r\nshows a uniform fall of temperature at the adiabatic rate to the cloud\r\nlevel. During the night, the lower part of the broken line bends\r\ndecidedly to the left, showing a body of relatively cold air near the\r\nground, caused by radiation. There is a rise of temperature with\r\nincreasing altitude above the ground up to a certain height, and\r\nafterwards a comparatively uniform fall as high as the clouds, if they\r\nexist; but the rate of fall with increasing altitude, shown by the\r\nupper part of the diagram, is slower at night than during the day. It\r\nappears that the diurnal change of temperature is very small at great\r\naltitudes, compared with the change near the earth's surface. The\r\nrelative humidity (Fig. 5) up to 2000 metres varies inversely with the\r\ntemperature, and in the present case there was only a slight change in\r\nthe direction of the wind (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE IX.--MEAN CHANGES WITH HEIGHT, AND CHANGES\r\n   DURING THE KITE-FLIGHT OF OCT. 8, 1896.]\r\n\r\n=Diurnal Changes of Temperature at Different Altitudes.=--The curve\r\nrepresenting the diurnal change in the air at some distance above the\r\nground is probably similar to one representing the change near the\r\nground, except that its amplitude is less. If this be true, then the\r\ndiurnal rate of fall for a given time at any two levels will be\r\nproportional to the daily ranges of temperature at the two levels. It\r\nis impossible in practice to keep a kite at exactly the same level for\r\ntwenty-four hours; hence the daily ranges for the different levels\r\nmust be found by comparing the rates of rise or fall of temperature\r\nfor given times with the rates found from records near the ground,\r\nmade simultaneously with those above. In Plate IX., Fig. 1, the\r\nresults for six stations, _i.e._ the kite at 1000 and 500 metres, the\r\nEiffel Tower in Paris (300 metres), the summit of Blue Hill, its base,\r\nand the valley (200, 50, and 15 metres respectively), are connected,\r\nand a smooth curve is drawn through them. The curve passes\r\napproximately through every one of the observed and the computed\r\nranges, except the one at the summit of Blue Hill, which is too great.\r\nThis evidently is because insolation and radiation, acting through the\r\nsoil of the hill, heat and cool the air to a greater extent than the\r\nfree air is heated and cooled at the same altitude, and this must be\r\ntrue at every mountain station. The smoothed curve passes also very\r\nslightly to the left of the data for the Eiffel Tower, indicating\r\nthat the range there is about 1∞ greater than the true range on\r\naccount of the heating and cooling of the Tower. From this it appears\r\nthat the diurnal range of temperature diminishes rapidly with\r\nincreasing altitude in the free air, and almost disappears in the\r\naverage at a height of 1000 metres.\r\n\r\nThe records of the anemometer show that, as a rule, the wind increases\r\nsteadily as the kites rise, but the increase is greatest between\r\nBoston and the top of Blue Hill, due probably to the retarding of the\r\nlower winds by contact with the ground. The results are plotted in\r\nPlate IX., Fig. 3, together with the mean wind velocity on Blue Hill\r\n(209 metres), and the velocity on a tower in Boston (60 metres).\r\nSingle records of the kite-anemometer differ much, for sometimes the\r\nwind velocity diminished with altitude, and at other times it\r\nincreased so rapidly that the kites were unable to rise higher. On\r\nseveral occasions when the kites passed from one current into another,\r\nhaving a different direction and a different temperature, the wind\r\nsuddenly increased, and was stronger between the two currents than\r\nabove or below that plane.\r\n\r\n=Diurnal Changes of Humidity at Different Altitudes.=--It is found\r\nthat as night approaches the humidity at the altitude of 1000 metres\r\ndiminishes, while at the earth it increases. This agrees with the\r\nevidence furnished by the cumulus clouds that form during the day\r\nbetween 1000 and 2000 metres, and disappear at night, thus visibly\r\nindicating an increase of humidity by day and a decrease by night. If\r\nthe trend of the humidity-curve at a height of 1000 metres is assumed\r\nto be the reverse of its trend at the ground, then the results from\r\nthe kite-meteorograph show the minimum humidity to be at the coldest\r\nand the maximum humidity at the warmest part of the day. The mean\r\ndaily ranges for different altitudes are plotted in Plate IX., Fig. 2.\r\nThe part of the curve at the left of the zero line shows the range at\r\ndifferent altitudes, with the minimum humidity near the warmest time\r\nof day, while the part at the right of the zero shows the ranges at\r\ndifferent altitudes, with the minimum humidity at the coldest time of\r\nday.\r\n\r\n=Types of Change of Temperature with Altitude.=--When the records of\r\ntemperature and humidity made aloft by the kite-meteorograph and at\r\nthe stations near the ground are plotted in relation to altitude, they\r\nare found to be easily divisible into a few types. In Plate X., Type 1\r\nrepresents the decrease of temperature on most fair days from the\r\nground to altitudes of a mile or more, when no clouds are met. The\r\ncontinuous line, plotted from the records of the ascent, represents\r\nthe day conditions, and the broken line, plotted from the records of\r\nthe descent, represents the night conditions. This curve shows that\r\nwith increasing altitude the temperature falls uniformly during the\r\nday and approximately at the adiabatic rate represented by the dotted\r\nlines. The fall of temperature with increasing altitude during the\r\nnight is slower than during the day, and in fact, from the earth's\r\nsurface to an altitude of a few hundred metres, there is often a rise\r\nof temperature with height, so that the air at altitudes of from 300\r\nto 500 metres may be considerably warmer than it is at the ground.\r\nThis was shown in the descent on October 8, 1896, and is found in Type\r\n3.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE X.--CHANGES WITH HEIGHT RECORDED BY KITES\r\n   AT BLUE HILL.]\r\n\r\nWhen clouds are traversed during the flight, the temperature curve\r\nassumes the form of Type 2. The continuous curve is plotted from the\r\nrecords of an ascent; the broken curve from the records of the\r\ndescent, both occurring in the day-time. The temperature falls at the\r\nadiabatic rate in unsaturated air till the base of the cumulus cloud\r\nis reached. It falls at a slower rate in the cloud, the rate probably\r\nbeing that computed by physicists as the adiabatic rate for air in\r\nwhich condensation is taking place. Above the clouds, the fall of\r\ntemperature appears to be very slow.\r\n\r\nType 3 is a condition which persists throughout the day and night, and\r\nit resembles the night form of Type 1. The temperature rises very\r\nrapidly for a short distance above the ground and then falls, with\r\nincrease of height, somewhat slower than the adiabatic rate. The rise\r\nof temperature near the ground with increasing height is more marked\r\nafter sunset than during the day-time.\r\n\r\nType 4 was illustrated by the ascent of October 8. This distribution\r\nof temperature is caused by a warmer current overflowing colder air,\r\nwhich is very commonly found at low altitudes in the atmosphere and\r\nprobably exists usually at some altitude, great or small. Recent\r\nobservations indicate that this type represents the normal condition\r\nof the atmosphere in all sorts of weather. Frequently there are two or\r\nmore sudden rises of temperature at different heights, so that the\r\nplotted data resemble inverted stair-steps. During the day there is a\r\ndecrease of temperature at the adiabatic rate (1∞∑8 in 100 metres)\r\nfrom the ground to the height of several hundred metres, then a sudden\r\nrise of temperature in the next one or two hundred metres, and above\r\nthis a slow fall of temperature with increasing altitude, usually much\r\nless than the adiabatic rate. Generally, clouds are found near the\r\nplane of meeting of the warm and cold current.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of Type 4, that is, a sudden fall of temperature, due to a\r\ncolder current overlying a warmer one, is probably impossible, because\r\nthe colder air, on account of its greater weight, would immediately\r\nbegin to sink and the warmer air would rise. This should cause a fall\r\nof temperature at the adiabatic rate from the ground to the top of the\r\ncolder current, and is probably the origin of the \"cold wave\" shown in\r\nType 5. Both the continuous and broken curves (representing an ascent\r\nand a descent) show a fall of temperature at the adiabatic rate of\r\nunsaturated air, from about 500 metres to the highest point reached.\r\nUp to 500 metres the decrease of temperature is more rapid than the\r\nadiabatic rate, due to the rapid moving in of colder air above,\r\nwhereby air rising from the ground is cooled by contact as well as by\r\nits expansion, and also because the air is heated more than usual by\r\ncontact with the ground, which under these conditions is abnormally\r\nwarmer. This is the special characteristic of the \"cold wave\" type of\r\ncurve during the day hours. The night form of Type 5, notwithstanding\r\nthe excessive radiation from the ground through the dry air, shows a\r\nrapid decrease of temperature with increase of altitude from the\r\nground upward.\r\n\r\nType 6 shows a less common, but an interesting form, of vertical\r\ndistribution of temperature, in which the temperature is about the\r\nsame from 400 metres to 1400 metres or more. Up to 400 metres there is\r\na fall of temperature with increasing altitude during the day, and a\r\nrise with increasing altitude at night. These last conditions can be\r\nreadily traced to the effects of insolation and radiation near the\r\nground. In the morning, if the temperature of the air be the same from\r\nthe ground up to 1000 metres or more, the heating of the ground by the\r\nsun will cause ascending currents, until the warmest part of the day.\r\nThis air, cooling by expansion at the adiabatic rate, will rise to\r\nabout 440 metres before it assumes the mean temperature of the upper\r\nair column. At night cooling takes place next the ground by radiation\r\nand is gradually transferred upward a few hundred metres by\r\nconduction, thus producing an increasing temperature with increasing\r\naltitude, until sunrise. As a result of the conditions described, it\r\nis evident that on certain days the diurnal range of temperature is\r\nbut little felt above 500 metres.\r\n\r\n=Types of Change of Relative Humidity with Altitude.=--As in the\r\ntemperature types, the continuous lines represent the records of the\r\nascent, and the broken lines the records of the descent, generally\r\nunder changing conditions. Lines inclining upward to the left show a\r\ndecreasing humidity, and to the right an increasing humidity.\r\n\r\nType 1 may be called a normal type of curve when there are clouds. A\r\nvariation of this type was met with in the ascent on October 8, 1896,\r\nand it differed from that now illustrated in indicating in its upper\r\npart a fall of humidity rather than a rise. These two types can be\r\ntaken as the normal change of humidity with change of altitude in\r\ncloudy or partly cloudy weather. The humidity increases steadily to\r\nthe base of the cloud, then there is complete saturation in the cloud,\r\nand above it is a sudden fall of humidity, on entering the dry air\r\nabove the cloud, into which the ascending currents from the ground\r\nhave not penetrated.\r\n\r\nType 3 is a clear-weather form of curve in which the humidity\r\nincreases until a certain altitude is reached, probably at the upper\r\nlimits of the currents rising from the ground. Above this altitude the\r\nhumidity decreases rapidly.\r\n\r\nType 5 is also a clear-weather form and accompanies the \"cold wave\"\r\ntype of temperature, also numbered 5. The very dry descending air\r\nmingles with air rendered damp by ascent, and the result is a nearly\r\nuniform relative humidity at different altitudes, although the\r\nabsolute humidity diminishes on account of decreasing pressure and\r\ntemperature. In Type 6 both the relative and the absolute humidity\r\ndecrease rapidly, this type coinciding with the temperature, Type 6.\r\n\r\nDuring the week of September 5 to 11, 1897, kite-flights were made\r\ndaily on Blue Hill. Twice the kites were maintained in the air, and\r\ncontinuous records were obtained during most of twenty-four hours.\r\nThese records furnish an example of the small diurnal changes of\r\ntemperature in the free air at short distances above the ground, which\r\nwere deduced from the average changes at different hours and at\r\ndifferent heights. From 2 p.m. of the fifth to 2 p.m. of the sixth,\r\nthe altitude of the self-recording instruments varied between 500 and\r\n1000 metres above sea-level, averaging about 700 metres and varying\r\nlittle from this height during much of the night. The times when the\r\nkite-meteorograph crossed the 700-metre level in ascending and\r\ndescending were determined from its barograph trace, and the\r\nsynchronous temperatures and humidities were read from the records of\r\nits thermograph and hygrograph. The results have been plotted in Plate\r\nXI., Figs. 1 and 2, together with the temperatures recorded\r\nsimultaneously at the summit and valley stations of the Observatory\r\nand the humidities at the summit. Fig. 1 shows that the diurnal\r\nvariation of temperature, well marked at the lower levels, is very\r\nslight or has entirely disappeared at 700 metres. Fig. 2 shows that\r\nthe course of the relative humidity at 700 metres is exactly opposite\r\nin phase to that recorded at lower levels, for at 700 metres the\r\nminimum humidity was recorded at night and the maximum during the day,\r\nwhile the opposite conditions prevailed on the hill. Repeated\r\nkite-flights indicate that these are the normal conditions at the two\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nIn Plate XI., Fig. 3, is plotted a curve from the hourly readings of\r\nthe thermograph at the Blue Hill valley station (fifteen metres)\r\nduring the week, and also a curve connecting temperatures recorded by\r\nthe kite-meteorograph once or twice each day during the same week at a\r\nlevel of 500 metres, obtained in the way described or computed from\r\nthe adiabatic change. All the night records show that it was decidedly\r\nwarmer at the height of 500 metres during the night than it was at the\r\nground, except during the cool wave on the seventh and eighth.\r\nFurthermore, the curves in Fig. 3 indicate a control of the surface\r\ntemperatures during the day by those above. For instance, on the\r\nseventh there was a distinct flattening of the day curve, evidently\r\nbecause, as the temperature on the ground rose 10∞ above that at 500\r\nmetres, the air was in unstable equilibrium, and colder air descended\r\nto take the place of the surface air so that its temperature could\r\nrise no higher. On the tenth, the temperature at 500 metres was\r\nconsiderably greater than the mean of the day at the ground, and the\r\nair at the ground did not acquire the unstable condition in any volume\r\nuntil the warmest part of the day, so that the diurnal curve at the\r\nlower station forms a sharp peak.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE XI.--KITE OBSERVATIONS AT BLUE HILL,\r\n   SEPT. 5-11, 1897.]\r\n\r\nSince there appears to be no appreciable diurnal period in the\r\ntemperature at and above 500 metres, a better comparison of the\r\nrelative changes aloft and below during the passage of warm and cold\r\nwaves is obtained by smoothing out the diurnal period below. This has\r\nbeen done in Plate XI., Fig. 4, with the data given by the kites at\r\n500 and 1000 metres plotted in curves, which it was necessary to\r\ncomplete by extrapolation. It is seen that there is a much greater\r\nrange in the temperature from the crest of a warm to the crest of a\r\ncold wave at a height of 500 metres than at the ground. At 1000 metres\r\nthe range appears to be slightly greater than at 500 metres, and the\r\ncrests of the warm and cold waves occur successively earlier than they\r\ndo at the ground. On the approach, and until the passage of the crest\r\nof the cold wave the air is colder aloft than at the ground, the\r\ndifference being apparently that of the adiabatic cooling of ascending\r\nair. After the passage of the crest of the cold wave, the temperature\r\naloft rises much more rapidly than at the ground, and at the crest of\r\nthe warm wave the air at 500 metres is some 10∞ warmer than the mean\r\ndaily temperature at the ground. In many kite-flights the difference\r\nwas found to be even greater than this. Taking the mean temperature of\r\ntwenty-four-hours, it is seen that the average temperature at the\r\nground during a week or more is about the same as it is at 500\r\nmetres. Fig. 5 shows the change in the vertical distribution of\r\ntemperature during the oncoming of the warm wave on the eighth and\r\nearly morning of the ninth, as determined by four ascents, culminating\r\nat 11 a.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m., and 4 a.m. The lines of 59∞, 62∞, 65∞,\r\nand 68∞ show that there was a gradual rise of temperature aloft, which\r\nextended downwards to 200 metres, or to the top of Blue Hill. Clouds\r\nformed at the level of lowest temperature, and these sank also until\r\nthey covered the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nPlate XII. is a facsimile of the meteorogram during the kite-flight of\r\nOctober 15, 1897, the lower part showing the trace of the barometer on\r\na scale of heights in metres, the middle section the trace of the\r\nhygrometer, and the upper one the trace of the thermometer on a scale\r\nof Centigrade degrees. The temperature followed the normal change,\r\nwhich is as follows: during the day, up to a certain height, which\r\nvaries under different conditions, there is a decrease nearly at the\r\nadiabatic rate of 1∞∑8 F. per hundred metres. Above that height the\r\nair suddenly becomes warmer, and then cools with ascent at a rate\r\nsomewhat less than the adiabatic rate. During the night there is a\r\nmarked inversion of temperature between the ground and 200 or 300\r\nmetres.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE XII.--AUTOMATIC RECORDS DURING A HIGH\r\n   KITE-FLIGHT AT BLUE HILL.]\r\n\r\nHigher than this, the temperature decreases at a fairly uniform rate,\r\nbut more slowly than the adiabatic rate. Although no clouds were\r\nvisible, yet the relative humidity increased greatly, both during the\r\nascent and descent, near 1500 and 2700 metres, these being about the\r\nheights at which cumulus and alto-cumulus clouds usually form.\r\n\r\nDuring September 1898 four kite-flights were made on four successive\r\ndays when an anti-cyclone and a cyclone passed nearly over Blue Hill.\r\nThis is a rare occurrence, and the mechanism of these phenomena was\r\naccordingly studied by Mr. Clayton, some of whose deductions will now\r\nbe given, illustrated by Plate XIII. Figs. 1 and 2 give the\r\ntemperature plotted according to height on September 21 in the\r\nanti-cyclone, and on September 22, when the barometric pressure was\r\nfalling, the full lines, as in previous diagrams, indicating\r\nobservations during the ascents, and the broken lines observations\r\nduring the descents. It is seen that from the ground the lines all\r\nincline upward to the left, indicating a fall of temperature, to a\r\ncertain height when the lines bend to the right sharply, showing a\r\nsudden rise of temperature. Above this, the temperature again falls,\r\nbut more slowly than at lower levels. The general prevalence of this\r\nphenomenon was noted by Welsh in his balloon ascents in England in\r\n1854, and the high kite-flights at Blue Hill show it to be very\r\nfrequent below 2000 metres. The plane of increased temperature usually\r\ndetermines the height of the tops of cumulus and strato-cumulus\r\nclouds. Above 2000 metres other sudden rises of temperature are found\r\nduring the highest kite-flights.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE XIII.--RESULTS OF KITE-FLIGHTS AT BLUE\r\n   HILL DURING AN ANTI-CYCLONE AND A CYCLONE.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 3 to 6 show the changes in the various elements during the four\r\ndays at some of the following levels, viz. near sea-level, 200, 1000,\r\n2000, and 3000 metres. Fig. 3 shows the changes in the barometer at\r\nthe four levels, from which it is evident that the fall of pressure\r\nwas greatest near sea-level.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows temperature changes at the different levels, and\r\nindicates that the changes were of the same nature up to 3000 metres.\r\nThe greatest non-diurnal range of temperature is seen to be at 1000\r\nmetres, and it diminishes both at higher and at lower levels.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows changes in relative humidity at 200, 1000, and 2000\r\nmetres. The curves show that the greatest range of humidity was at\r\n2000 metres. There the relative humidity rose from almost zero, in the\r\nanti-cyclone on the twenty-first, to saturation at the same level in\r\nthe cyclone. At 200 metres the change is similar to that at 2000, but\r\nis less in amount. At 1000 metres the relative humidity fell until the\r\ntwenty-second, but then rose rapidly, showing the very dry air at\r\n2000 metres on the twenty-first had descended as low as 1000 metres on\r\nthe twenty-second.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 gives the change in wind velocity at the different levels.\r\nThere was an increase of wind at all the levels from the time of the\r\npassage of the anti-cyclone to the passage of the cyclone. The minimum\r\nof wind at 200 metres was in the anti-cyclone, with a secondary\r\nminimum during the passage of the centre of the cyclone.\r\n\r\nFigs. 7 to 10 show the changes in height from day to day of the equal\r\nconditions at the different levels. Fig. 7 shows the change in level\r\nof the isobars, which, although very small, is largest at the lower\r\nlevels. The light broken lines in Fig. 7 and subsequent figures\r\nindicate the axes of the anti-cyclone and cyclone. That the axis of\r\nthe cyclone was inclined backward, and that the high pressure occurred\r\nlater at high than at low levels, was confirmed by the wind\r\nobservations on the twenty-first.\r\n\r\nFig. 8 shows the heights at which the same temperatures were found on\r\nsuccessive days. Since the isotherms rose until the twenty-third, the\r\ntemperature of the air up to 3000 metres was higher on the day of the\r\ncyclone than on the day of the anti-cyclone. Previous high flights\r\nindicate that this is the normal condition in the moving cyclones and\r\nanti-cyclones of the eastern United States. As the light broken lines\r\nrepresent the axes of the anti-cyclone and cyclone up to 3000 metres,\r\nit is seen that at this level the temperature at the place of maximum\r\npressure is probably higher than at the place of minimum pressure,\r\nalthough this is not true for a vertical column of air above the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 gives the positions of equal humidities on successive days,\r\nsaturated and cloudy areas being indicated by crossed shading, and\r\nless humidity by single ruling. From the laws of thermo-dynamics the\r\nunshaded curves should represent descending currents, and the shaded\r\nportions ascending ones. In the first case, increased warmth and a\r\nlower relative humidity are produced in the descent to a lower\r\naltitude; in the last case, cooling, increasing relative humidity, and\r\ncondensation are produced by expansion in the ascent to a higher\r\naltitude. Consequently, two regions of descending air are indicated,\r\none in the centre of the anti-cyclone, the other in the centre of the\r\ncyclone.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 shows the change in height of the lines of equal wind\r\nvelocity. With ascending currents and precipitation, high wind\r\nvelocities were found at low levels, because of increased barometric\r\ngradient, while with the descending currents in the anti-cyclone and\r\ncentre of the cyclone, the high velocities were found only at great\r\naltitudes. The study of these data indicate that the cyclonic and\r\nanti-cyclonic circulations observed in this latitude do not embrace\r\nany air-movements at greater altitudes than 2000 metres, except in\r\nfront of the cyclone, when the air appears to be carried upward to a\r\ngreat height. Above 2000 metres there are probably other weak cyclones\r\nand anti-cyclones, or secondary ones, with their centres at different\r\nplaces from those at the earth's surface and producing a different\r\ncirculation of wind. The observations of the cirrus clouds at Blue\r\nHill indicate that at their level exists a cyclonic circulation above\r\nthe anti-cyclone apparent at the earth's surface. The shallowness of\r\nour anti-cyclones would be inferred from the great differences in\r\nspeed of the general atmospheric drift, for since the velocity of the\r\ngeneral drift from the west is more than thirty times greater at\r\n10,000 metres than it is at 200 metres, a circulation of great depth\r\ncould not endure long. Cyclones and anti-cyclones appear to be but\r\nsecondary phenomena in the great waves of warm and cold air which\r\nsweep across the United States from periodic causes.\r\n\r\nThe origin of cyclones and anti-cyclones is perhaps the most important\r\nproblem remaining for meteorological study. The theory that they are\r\nproduced by differences of temperature in adjacent masses of air, or,\r\nas it is called, the convectional theory of the American\r\nmeteorologists, Espy and Ferrel, is opposed by the observations on\r\nmountains in Europe which were collected by Dr. Hann of Vienna. If the\r\nquestion can be solved by the use of kites, as seems to be\r\nforeshadowed by the results just stated, another foundation-stone will\r\nbe laid in the science of meteorology and the status of the kite\r\nestablished as an instrument of research. The kite fails when there is\r\nlittle or no wind at the ground, but it seems possible in such cases\r\nto lift the kite into the upper air, where there usually is wind, by\r\nattaching it to a small balloon that, after the kite can support\r\nitself, shall be detached automatically. While the height to which\r\nkites can rise is limited, and the limit is probably being approached,\r\njudging from the less gain of altitude in recent flights, yet it seems\r\nreasonable to expect that, with favourable conditions, a height of at\r\nleast three miles will be reached.\r\n\r\nBesides lifting the meteorological instruments described, kites can\r\ncarry apparatus for other investigations in the free air, such as the\r\nmeasurement of atmospheric electricity, and the collection of samples\r\nof air, to be examined for cosmic dust and bacteria. Cameras have been\r\nlifted by kites, as already said, and for the purpose of photographing\r\nthe upper surfaces of clouds there is being constructed for the Blue\r\nHill Observatory a very light automatic camera, similar in principle\r\nto M. Cailletet's apparatus for photographing the ground from a\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nThe use of the kite as an aeroplane can only be alluded to in this\r\nbook, and it may be sufficient to say that if a motor attached to a\r\nkite can, by wings or screws, propel it against the wind, the\r\nsustaining string is unnecessary, and we shall have the flying machine\r\nwhich Professor Langley tells us will soon be realized. The surface of\r\nour globe has been tolerably well explored; the exploration of the\r\natmosphere by balloons and kites will continue to make great progress\r\nduring the last year of the century, and at the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury we may confidently expect that as the seas now are a medium\r\nfor transportation, so the ocean of air will have been brought\r\nlikewise into man's domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n A\r\n\r\n Abercromby (R.), classification of clouds, 42\r\n Academy of Sciences, French, 18, 72-3\r\n Academy of Sciences, Russian, balloon ascent, 72\r\n Accademia del Cimento, 14\r\n Actinometer, ViollÈ's, 115\r\n Adiabatic rate of change of temperature, 29\r\n Aeronautical Conference at Chicago, 125\r\n ---- Conference at Strassburg, 97, 110\r\n ---- Committee; International, 108\r\n _AÈrophile_ balloons, 102, 104\r\n Aerostatic Commission, French, 111\r\n Air, collection and analysis of, 70, 73, 75, 82, 112\r\n ---- weight of, 16\r\n Aitken (J.), dust particles, 39\r\n Alhazen (B.
