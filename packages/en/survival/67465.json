Practical experience proves the inefficiency\r\nof many so-called cures, and points to the urgency of poultrymen\r\nendeavoring to understand more thoroughly the causes of the ailments to\r\nwhich domestic fowls are liable.\r\n\r\nMy aim is to put a concise handbook into the hands of poultry rearers,\r\nwho should thus be assisted in determining the various diseases\r\nand in taking the precautionary steps important in preventing the\r\nintroduction and spread of contagious diseases. No effort is made\r\nto elaborate the scientific side of the subject. Those desirous of\r\nobtaining full information about the types of organisms that have been\r\nproved to be the specific causes of, or to be invariably associated\r\nwith, particular disorders, may do so with profit by obtaining fuller\r\nworks on the subject. Many scientific workers are devoting their time\r\nto the problem of combating diseases among poultry, and assistance is\r\nwillingly given by officers of the experiment stations to farmers who\r\ndesire to identify any disease causing loss in their flocks.\r\n\r\nThe practical poultryman will recognize the fact that measures for the\r\ncontrol of disease cannot be limited to sanitation and the treatment\r\nof sick birds, but, in reality, include such important matters as the\r\nselection of healthy stock, intelligent feeding, proper housing, and\r\nother details essential to the successful management of poultry.\r\n\r\nI gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to the works of Dr. D. E.\r\nSalmon and John H. Robinson, editor of Farm Poultry, and to the recent\r\npublication on poultry diseases by Dr. Raymond Pearl, Frank M. Surface,\r\nand Maynie R. Curtis. My thanks are due to R. S. Martinez for the\r\ncare taken in making the photographs from which the drawings for the\r\nillustrations in the chapter on Post-Mortem Examinations were prepared.\r\nMuch valuable information has also been obtained from bulletins issued\r\nby the experiment stations of the United States and by the Ontario\r\nAgricultural College of Canada.\r\n\r\n  E. J.

Importance of Controlling Disease_\r\n\r\nThe ravages of disease add considerably to the difficulties of raising\r\npoultry in all parts of the world. It is the experience of poultry\r\nrearers that an annual toll has to be paid in the lives of young birds\r\nand older stock. Sooner or later, in addition, an epidemic may break\r\nout and result in heavy losses and much discouragement.\r\n\r\nIt is most important, therefore, to be able to recognize the symptoms\r\nand to know the causes of the many diseases to which various kinds of\r\npoultry are subject. Every practical effort should be made to reduce\r\navoidable mortality. An unexplained death should be regarded with\r\nconcern. It may point to the presence of a serious disease. When there\r\nis not sufficient external evidence for determining the cause of\r\ndeath, a post-mortem examination should be made (see page 98).\r\n\r\nThe poultryman must know above all whether he is dealing with an\r\ninfectious disease or not. The discovery that a sudden death among\r\nhis fowls is due to apoplexy will set his mind at ease. On the other\r\nhand, if a case of cholera occurs, the body of the dead fowl should be\r\nburnt, and a vigorous campaign started to prevent the spread of the\r\ndisease; birds showing mopishness and other suspicious symptoms should\r\nbe isolated; the houses, the feed troughs, the water vessels, and the\r\nyard to which the dead fowl has had access, should all be thoroughly\r\ndisinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2. Dangers of Introducing Disease_\r\n\r\nPerhaps more loss has been caused by introducing birds with disease\r\ninto a healthy flock than by any other means. Readers will, doubtless,\r\nbe able to recall occasions on which their own, or their neighbors’,\r\nflocks suffered. An instance was recently related to the writer. A\r\npoultryman was offered two fowls, which he at first refused, but owing\r\nto the vagrant seller’s importunity, he eventually bought the birds and\r\nlet them loose among the home flock. On the following day one died; but\r\nno effort was made to discover the cause, nor was the dead fowl’s body\r\nburnt. In a few days, a fowl belonging to the original flock died and,\r\nin three to four weeks after the purchase, two-thirds of the stock had\r\ndied. It afterwards transpired that the vendor had lost several of his\r\nfowls from cholera, and the fear of further mortalities had been his\r\nreason for being so anxious to dispose of the survivors.\r\n\r\nOn every farm where poultry is kept, there should be a quarantine ward\r\nfor new purchases. The most careful breeders will isolate their own\r\nbirds that have returned from an exhibition, for fear they may have\r\ncontracted some disease there or on the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3. Control Measures_\r\n\r\nPractical experience and scientific investigation have clearly proved\r\nthat preventive measures are more economical and effective than\r\ncurative. Failing prevention, everything points to the importance of\r\ndealing promptly with the first cases, owing to the risk of infection\r\nof the rest of the stock. Control measures may be divided into three\r\nclasses:\r\n\r\n 1. Proper housing and feeding of fowls.\r\n\r\n 2. General sanitation and disinfection.\r\n\r\n 3. Administration of medicine to sick birds.\r\n\r\nThe details to which special attention must be given are covered by the\r\nfollowing axiomatic rules:\r\n\r\n 1. Isolate birds recently purchased—for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n 2. Isolate every bird that shows any sign of ill health.\r\n\r\n 3. Provide a fresh and pure supply of water in a shady position.\r\n\r\n 4. Add Epsom salts (one teaspoonful to a quart) once a week to the\r\n drinking water. Give chickens daily a liberal supply of bran in\r\n addition to their other food.\r\n\r\n 5. Feed birds on a varied diet, including green food.\r\n\r\n 6. Arrange that birds have to scratch for some of their food.\r\n\r\n 7. Construct houses, nest boxes, etc., so that they can be readily and\r\n thoroughly disinfected. Houses should be free from drafts.\r\n\r\n 8. Disinfect contaminated soil by spraying, liming, and resting.\r\n\r\n 9. Visit the roosts at night to detect cases of wheezing due to colds,\r\n and to search for mites and other pests.\r\n\r\n 10. Keep on hand disinfectants, lice powders and medicines likely to\r\n be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4. Nursing Sick Birds_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—ISOLATION]\r\n\r\nThe small margin of profit on a single fowl makes dosing with medicines\r\nand nursing an unprofitable occupation, except in the case of valuable\r\nstock. If the treatment of a bird is undertaken, it should be borne\r\nin mind that more depends upon attention to the rules of good nursing\r\nthan to the administration of drugs. Comfortable quarters, warm and\r\nfree from drafts, clean straw, and invalid’s diet of soft and easily\r\ndigested food will all turn the chances in favor of recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—ISOLATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—DESOLATION]\r\n\r\nToo often isolation is in effect a death sentence. The bird is put into\r\ncramped quarters, exposed to cold winds and beating rains, and, being\r\nin an out-of-the-way corner, is, perhaps, neglected instead of being\r\nspecially cared for.\r\n\r\nFowls that will not take food should be fed lightly, but frequently,\r\nwith a spoon in order that their strength may be kept up. All stale\r\nfood should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_5. The Use of Drugs and Medicines_\r\n\r\nDrugs and medicines likely to be required should always be kept in\r\nstock. The weekly use of Epsom salts, as a mild laxative for preventing\r\nintestinal disorders, is strongly recommended. Little faith should be\r\nput in drugs said to cure tuberculosis, cholera, etc. Below is given a\r\nlist of the medicines generally required. The doses given in the table\r\nare for a medium-sized adult fowl; three-quarters as much should be\r\ngiven for a half-grown bird, and about one-fifth for a young chicken.\r\nTreatment should be repeated as necessary, and animals should be well\r\nnursed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—POULTRYMAN’S MEDICINE SHELVES]\r\n ───────────────────────────┬──────────────────┬────────────────────────\r\n     MEDICINE               │ DOSE OR STRENGTH │        DISEASE\r\n ───────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼────────────────────────\r\n  _Stimulants_—             │                  │\r\n    Brandy                  │3-10 drops in     │\r\n                            │     warm milk    │\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Aperients_—              │                  │\r\n    Calomel                 │1 grain           │ Diarrhea; liver disease.\r\n    Castor oil              │1 teaspoonful     │ Diarrhea.\r\n                            │                  │\r\n    Epsom salts             │20 grains to 50   │ }\r\n                            │  grains in       │ } Constipation; diarrhea;\r\n                            │  food or         │ }   liver disease.\r\n                            │  warm water      │ }\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Astringents_—            │                  │\r\n    Chlorodyne              │ 6-12 drops       │  Diarrhea; dysentery.\r\n    Laudanum (relieves pain)│ 4-6 drops        │  Diarrhea; dysentery.\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Tonic and Febrifuge_—    │                  │\r\n    Quinine                 │1 grain           │  }\r\n    Aconite                 │1 drop            │  } Colds; fever; roup.\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _For Worms_—              │                  │\r\n    Turpentine              │ 5 to 10 drops    │  }\r\n                            │  in 1 teaspoonful│  }\r\n                            │  castor oil      │  } Worms (intestinal).\r\n    Santonin                │ 3 to 5 grains    │  }\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Antiseptic Washes_—      │                  │\r\n    (a) Carbolic acid       │ 1-5% sol.        │  }\r\n    (b) Hydrogen peroxide   │ 50%              │  }Colds; roup;\r\n    (c) Creolin             │ 2-5% sol.        │  }  diphtheria;\r\n    (d) Permanganate of     │  ½-2% sol.       │  }cuts and injuries.\r\n          potash            │                  │\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Dressing Flesh Wounds_—  │                  │\r\n    ½ creolin and           │                  │\r\n    ½ sweet oil             │                  │ Cuts and injuries.\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _To Reduce Swellings_—    │                  │\r\n    Iodine                  │Tincture          │\r\n    Embrocation:            │                  │\r\n      Turpentine            │10 drops          │ } Cramp.\r\n      Sweet oil             │1 ounce           │ } Rheumatism.\r\n                            │                  │\r\n  _Insecticides_—           │                  │\r\n    Lice powders            │                  │ Lice, mites.\r\n    Kerosene                │                  │ Scaly legs.\r\n    Sulphur ointment:       │                  │ Lice, scaly legs,\r\n      Sulphur               │1 part            │ mites, ticks.\r\n      Kerosene              │1 part            │\r\n      Lard                  │2 parts           │\r\n ───────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.—By accepting that 1¼ teaspoonfuls made up to a pint with water\r\ngives approximately a 1% solution, any of the weak dilutions required\r\nby poultrymen can be easily prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_6. Disinfection_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—HOW DISEASE IS SPREAD\r\nGerms of tuberculosis in the excrement of a fowl. (After Edwards.)]\r\n\r\nThe important part played by micro-organisms in causing and spreading\r\ndisease must be understood before the value of disinfection can be\r\nfully appreciated. The poultryman must develop a sense of sight that\r\nsees lurking microbes at every turn, especially in unclean corners.\r\nFigure 5 shows germs revealed by the microscope in the excrement of a\r\nbird suffering from tuberculosis. The fact that this speck contained\r\nso many germs, although it was far too small to be seen with the naked\r\neye, will give an idea of how epidemics may be caused by food, water,\r\nand soil contaminated by excreta, nasal discharges, etc.\r\n\r\nRegular and thorough disinfection of woodwork, of feeding vessels,\r\nand of the drinking water should form part of the routine of poultry\r\nmanagement, and a stock of disinfectants should always be kept on\r\nhand. It will be found convenient to have an iron drum with a tap\r\nfor a diluted solution, say 5%, of some standard disinfectant—e. g.,\r\ncreolin—that can be further diluted as required.\r\n\r\n_Water._ A stock solution of permanganate of potash, made by adding\r\nten grains to one quart of water, should always be kept on hand for\r\npurposes of disinfection. When there is danger of infection, two\r\ntablespoonfuls of this solution should be added to every gallon of\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\n_Feeding Vessels._ Clean with boiling water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—AIDS TO THOROUGH DISINFECTION]\r\n\r\n_Houses and Fixtures._ Spray with 2% to 5% creolin (or other\r\ndisinfectant) and whitewash afterwards, or use whitewash to which 2%\r\nof creolin has been added. The whitewash should be prepared with\r\nquick-lime. The house should first be cleaned out with an iron scraper\r\nand scrubbing brush, using a liberal supply of water (see Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n_Soil._ The most convenient of the following methods should be adopted:\r\n\r\n(1) Spray surface with 5% creolin.\r\n\r\n(2) Spread straw over ground and set fire to it.\r\n\r\n(3) Fork over and lime. This method is not sufficient if serious\r\ncontamination is suspected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF EXTERNAL SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n  ───────────────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────────────\r\n            DISEASE      │ EXTERNAL SYMPTOMS  │      TREATMENT\r\n  ───────────────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────────────\r\n                                              │\r\n  _1.

The symptoms of such\r\ndiseases are for the most part similar to those noticed when fowls are\r\naffected, and treatment must be on the same lines. In the management of\r\nturkeys, ducks, geese, guinea fowls and pigeons, the strictest sanitary\r\nmeasures must be enforced, as in the rearing of fowls.\r\n\r\nOwing to its importance, blackhead of turkeys is dealt with separately.\r\nIt is one of the most serious of poultry diseases and causes heavy\r\nlosses to turkey rearers. Careful study should be made of the reports\r\nof the recent investigations at the Rhode Island Experiment Station.\r\n\r\nSevere epidemics of diarrhea or cholera occur among all classes of\r\npoultry. Geese are subject to a form of cholera that appears to be\r\ndifferent from any kind that attacks fowls. Water fowl are not commonly\r\ninfested with external parasites. Pigeons, on the other hand, are\r\nworried by fleas and ticks as well as mites. Smallpox of pigeons is\r\nsimilar to chicken pox of fowls, but pustular swellings may be found on\r\nthe rump and the cloaca of the pigeon as well as on the head. The scaly\r\nleg mite attacks turkeys and the gape worm is sometimes a serious pest\r\nof poults.

Squeeze out the pus;\r\nwash with 1% carbolic acid or creolin and dress with creolin and sweet\r\noil (half and half) until healed.\r\n\r\nThe most common abscess is that which forms on the pad of the foot and\r\ndevelops into bumblefoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANÆMIA, OR GOING LIGHT\r\n\r\n   _A condition that should incite the poultryman to investigate the\r\n                                cause_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Birds lose weight, or ”go light,” without any apparent\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A general lack of thriftiness in the flock may be due to\r\ninsufficient or poor food, to lack of exercise, or to bad ventilation\r\nof houses; lice or mites may be infesting the birds. On the other hand,\r\nbirds may gradually lose weight as the result of some such disease as\r\ntuberculosis (see page 90}, aspergillosis (see page 29), or worms (see\r\npage 94).\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Make any changes in feeding or management that may appear\r\ndesirable. Search at night for mites or lice on the birds; in the\r\ndaytime examine the straw in nest boxes, the roosts, and the cracks and\r\ncrevices of the woodwork for parasites. Much time may often be saved in\r\ndiscovering what is wrong with the flock by killing one or more of the\r\naffected birds and making a post-mortem examination to discover if a\r\nspecific disease is the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APOPLEXY\r\n\r\n                        _Not a common trouble_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Staggering gait and bewildered appearance; bird generally\r\ndrops dead suddenly.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Attributed to high feeding or over-laying.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ There is usually no time for treatment, but if the attack\r\nis mild, put the bird in a dark place and give no food for a few hours;\r\ngive a dose of Epsom salts and add green food to diet. Bleeding from\r\nunder a wing is sometimes tried.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem examination_ shows clotted blood on the brain, the other\r\norgans being normal.\r\n\r\nThe name vertigo is applied to congestion of the brain as distinct\r\nfrom apoplexy due to hemorrhage of the brain. The fowl has fits. It is\r\ndifficult to distinguish this disease from epilepsy (see page 55). The\r\ncause is little understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ASPERGILLOSIS\r\n\r\n_A disease that exists more commonly than is usually suspected, and is\r\n      the cause of the death of large numbers of young chickens_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Fowls gradually lose weight, mope, and die without any\r\npronounced ailment except difficulty in breathing. In adults the\r\ndisease may be mistaken for tuberculosis and in chickens for white\r\ndiarrhea. Aspergillosis of chickens is dealt with under brooder\r\npneumonia. Post-mortem symptoms are whitish or yellowish growths on the\r\nwindpipe, that can only be definitely diagnosed under the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—HEAD SHOWING BRAIN EXPOSED]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A fungoid growth in the windpipe and bronchial tubes,\r\nsometimes extending to the lungs and liver. Fig. 8 shows the spores and\r\nfilaments of the species of aspergillosis most commonly responsible\r\nfor this disease. Infection may be due to musty grain or dirty straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—ASPERGILLOSIS\r\nOn left—Windpipe cut open. On right—A fungus that causes aspergillosis]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ No medicines are of any avail. Protection lies in not\r\nusing musty grain or moldy litter. Burn dead birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BLACKHEAD OF TURKEYS\r\n\r\n   _A very serious disease, making the successful rearing of turkeys\r\n               difficult and in some cases impossible_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Young turkeys, or poults, are most commonly attacked; there\r\nis loss of weight and loss of appetite; the bird appears listless and\r\nstands by itself with drooping wings and tail. Diarrhea is generally\r\none of the symptoms. The comb often turns a dark purple—a symptom that\r\nhas given rise to the name blackhead. Death generally follows an attack\r\nfairly rapidly, but in some cases the disease may take a chronic form,\r\nwhile it is believed that recovery is occasionally effected.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem symptoms._ The cæca (see Fig. 32) are enlarged, are\r\ndiseased in parts, and are more or less plugged with cheesy matter\r\nand pus. The liver is diseased, being sometimes very much enlarged\r\nand covered with yellowish necrotic areas, generally depressed in the\r\ncentre (see Fig. 24_d_). In cases of an acute attack, especially in\r\nyoung birds, one of the cæca only may be affected and the liver may\r\nnot be invaded. The extent of the necrotic areas and the degree of the\r\nenlargement of the infected organs may vary greatly in different cases.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The cause of blackhead has been shown by Drs. Cole and Hadley\r\nto be a coccidium. A full account of their work is published in\r\nBulletin 141 of the Rhode Island Experiment Station. Coccidia enter\r\nthe digestive tract of the healthy turkey by means of food or water\r\ninfected by the excrement of a sick bird. The organisms pass along\r\nthe alimentary canal until they reach the cæca, the lining of which\r\nthey attack, giving rise to the conditions mentioned under post-mortem\r\nsymptoms. How the infection spreads from the cæca to the liver is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nIt has been conclusively proved that fowls, as well as pigeons,\r\nsparrows, etc., act as hosts for these parasites. Although adult fowls\r\nhave a great degree of resistance themselves, they are a means of\r\ncarrying infection to turkeys.\r\n\r\nEggs may be one of the means of spreading the disease, as they may\r\nbecome contaminated in the oviduct or the cloaca of birds affected with\r\nblackhead.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ No remedy or satisfactory method of prevention has been\r\ndiscovered. The difficulty of effecting a cure is obvious when the\r\nnature of the disease is considered. Drs. Cole and Hadley summarize\r\nmeasures of prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Protect the yards and flocks which may have the good fortune to be\r\n uninfected with the blackhead organism by a thorough examination of\r\n all new stock, whether turkeys, fowls, geese or other domestic birds.\r\n\r\n 2. Keep the turkeys on grounds which are as fresh as can be obtained,\r\n and above all, keep them isolated from fowls and other domestic birds.\r\n\r\n 3. Keep every turkey in the flock under close observation in order\r\n to separate and at once isolate any bird which gives evidence of the\r\n disease. To facilitate such observations it is helpful to leg-band\r\n each individual, and to record its weight from time to time. Such a\r\n course makes it possible to learn whether any birds are losing weight,\r\n and if this is the case, these birds must be regarded with suspicion,\r\n and separated from the rest of the flock.\r\n\r\n 4. If it is known that blackhead is present in any of the poultry, the\r\n yard should be kept free from English sparrows, and the poultry houses\r\n and grain boxes from rats and mice, which have been shown to carry the\r\n causative organism.\r\n\r\n 5. When it is desired to fatten birds for the market, begin to\r\n increase the rations gradually. Never attempt to fatten birds which,\r\n in successive weighings, show a loss of weight. Overfeeding does not\r\n cause blackhead, but frequently causes the sudden death of birds in\r\n which blackhead is present.\r\n\r\n 6. When birds have died of blackhead, their bodies should be promptly\r\n burned or buried in order to prevent the dissemination of the\r\n coccidia, either through the ravages of rats or skunks, or consequent\r\n to the natural processes of decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BREAKDOWN\r\n\r\n                 _Not often seen in the poultry yard_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The abdomen becomes enlarged, hangs down at the back, and\r\nsometimes touches the ground.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Old layers are generally affected. The cause may be the strain\r\nof heavy laying, or may in cases be due to too much internal fat.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ No satisfactory treatment can be recommended and the bird\r\nhad best be killed. Such birds should not be used for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BRONCHITIS (CROUP)\r\n\r\n                           _Not very common_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Bronchitis may be distinguished by the rattling in the\r\nthroat of the bird affected and by the rapid breathing and cough. The\r\nrattling is due to mucus in the inflamed bronchial tubes. In bad cases,\r\nbirds mope, refuse to eat, and soon die.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Bronchitis may develop from an ordinary cold, or may be due to\r\nsudden changes of temperature, or to exposure to rain, cold, and damp.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Keep affected bird away from drafts and in a warm\r\nplace; dose with Epsom salts (see page 9) and give soft food, e. g.,\r\nbread, bran, and middlings, with milk. Wine of ipecacuanha has been\r\nrecommended for cases in which breathing is very difficult owing to\r\nexcessive inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BROODER PNEUMONIA\r\n\r\n     _A very serious disease, causing the death of many chickens_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Chickens affected stand by themselves with roughened\r\nplumage. There is a whitish diarrhea, and this disease can easily be\r\nmistaken for white diarrhea. (See page 92.) Post-mortem examination\r\nwill show yellowish spots on the lungs, on the walls of the air sacs,\r\nand on the liver and other organs, due to infection by the aspergillus\r\nfungus. (See page 29.)\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Infection by a species of the aspergillus fungus, the spores\r\nof which are probably inhaled. This fungus is common. The spores may be\r\nin the straw used for nests or for litter, or in the food, especially\r\nif it is at all moldy.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ There is no cure for an affected chicken, and the\r\npoultryman must aim at prevention. Vigorous sanitary measures are\r\nimperative. Clean straw or excelsior should be used for nests; eggs for\r\nhatching should be disinfected by wiping with 80% alcohol; incubators\r\nand brooders should be thoroughly disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BUMBLEFOOT\r\n\r\n                    _Not serious if treated early_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—BUMBLEFOOT]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Lameness with swelling on pad of foot.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Injury to sole of foot, developing into an abscess. Heavy\r\nbirds are more subject than light ones to bumblefoot, especially if\r\nmade to roost on perches that are too high.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Paint with iodine. Lance the abscess if it is sufficiently\r\nadvanced. Lower perches. Birds under treatment should have their feet\r\nbandaged, and should be put on deep straw to prevent further injury\r\nwhile the wounds are healing. Not serious if taken in hand promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CATARRH OF THE CROP\r\n\r\n                        _Not a common trouble_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Distention of crop with soft pasty matter of a more or less\r\noffensive character.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Eating stale, putrifying food or some poisonous matter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Empty the bird’s crop by holding the head downwards and\r\ngently pressing the contents out through the mouth. Feed sparingly on\r\nsoft food.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHICKEN POX OR SORE HEAD\r\n\r\n  _An infectious disease that causes considerable loss among chickens\r\n                   and young birds in warm climates_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Small, scabby, wart-like growths and eruptions on the head,\r\nespecially on the comb and the wattles and around the eyes—in bad cases\r\nextending to the lids and even the mouth. Chickens and young birds are\r\nmost commonly attacked by this disease, which spreads rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—CHICKEN POX]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The specific organism has not been definitely determined.\r\nChicken pox may be started by the introduction of an infected bird,\r\nand mosquitoes and other insects are suspected of being agents in its\r\nspread.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Prompt treatment may be very successful. Isolate affected\r\nbirds. Apply tincture of iodine, first scraping off the scabs. Creolin\r\n2%, or other disinfectants, may be used instead of iodine. Dirty coops\r\nare a contributing cause, and cleanliness of chicken runs and houses\r\nis important. Disinfect soil (see page 13) and woodwork (see page 12)\r\nregularly and with extra care when the first cases are noticed. When\r\nroupy lesions develop, as is sometimes the case, treat as for roup.\r\n(See page 83.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHOLERA\r\n\r\n_A serious and epidemic form of diarrhea for which no remedy is known_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Fowls die suddenly with apparently little reason. There are\r\nsymptoms of diarrhea and examination shows that the feces are a bright\r\nyellow or green instead of the normal color. Before death, fowls have\r\nfever and may be seen moping and showing evidences of distress. For\r\npost-mortem symptoms see page 112.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A contagious disease, due to bacteria, that, owing to\r\ninfection of soil and drinking water by birds suffering from the\r\ndisease, spreads rapidly through a flock. It is often introduced by the\r\npurchase of an infected bird that appears at the time of purchase to be\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Prevention by strict sanitary measures is what must be\r\naimed at. It is believed that no cure is known for genuine cases of\r\ncholera. Isolate all new birds brought into the flock, especially\r\nwhen cases of cholera are reported in the neighborhood. The bodies of\r\nbirds that have died of this disease are best burnt without delay.\r\nThe germ of cholera appears to be both persistent and easily spread,\r\nand too much stress cannot be laid on the necessity of preventing its\r\nintroduction, failing that, of quickly stamping it out. The sacrifice\r\nof a few birds to prevent the spread of the disease will be well\r\nrepaid, for it has been necessary on occasions to kill a whole flock.\r\nIn some cases it has been found best to move unaffected birds to new\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nFowl typhoid, or leukemia, is a disease of the blood that may be\r\nmistaken for cholera. The poultryman must treat it in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CLOACITIS OR VENT-GLEET\r\n\r\n                        _Not a common disease_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Frequent small discharges of excrement and unsuccessful\r\nefforts to discharge when the cloaca (Fig. 32) is empty, the mucous\r\nmembrane of which becomes hot and inflamed. These symptoms are soon\r\nfollowed by an offensive discharge.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A specific disease transmitted from hen to hen by the agency\r\nof the cock.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Immediately isolate affected hens; syringe out cloaca\r\ntwice daily with 2% creolin; give mild purgative and put on soft food.\r\nMales likely to be affected should be examined, and diseased birds\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n_Caution._ The hands should be carefully cleansed and disinfected, as\r\na serious inflammation will result if the eyes are rubbed with infected\r\nhands. This is a troublesome and risky disease to treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COCCIDIOSIS OF ADULT FOWLS\r\n\r\n     _The germ of this disease does not usually affect adult fowls\r\n    seriously, but causes severe losses among chickens and turkeys_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The external symptoms are not very pronounced; there is\r\nloss of weight and in some cases diarrhea. The disease may last for a\r\nlong time and birds may even recover. A post-mortem examination shows\r\nthe walls of the cæca thickened and filled with a pasty mass, while\r\ncharacteristic whitish or yellowish spots (see Fig. 24, _d_) are found\r\nin the liver.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ This disease is due to the same germ (a coccidium) that causes\r\nblackhead in turkeys. Adult fowls occasionally develop this disease,\r\nbut appear to be able, as a rule, to act as a host for the germs\r\nwithout being themselves affected, although heavy losses occur among\r\nturkeys or chickens that get the germ from them.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Copperas in the drinking water (three grains to a quart)\r\nhas been recommended, together with the occasional use of calomel in\r\none-grain doses, or one or two teaspoonfuls of castor oil. Thorough\r\ndisinfection (see page 10) of houses and runs, etc., where affected\r\nfowls have been, is important. Burn the bodies of birds that die of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLD (SIMPLE CATARRH)\r\n\r\n _Dangerous, because it may be confused with the early stages of roup_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Discharge from the nostrils and the eyes, with occasional\r\nfits of sneezing; loss of appetite, and moping.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Cold and damp. Colds most frequently occur in wet weather and\r\namong poorly housed and poorly fed stock.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Warm housing and protection from cold and wet. Give\r\nquinine—one grain to an adult fowl. Many believe in dosing fowls\r\nsuffering from colds with red pepper given in the food. When there\r\nare signs of stuffiness, the eyes and the nostrils should be washed\r\nout once or twice daily. Carbolic acid 2%, or boric acid, about 3%,\r\ndissolved in water, is recommended for this purpose. Witch hazel has\r\nbeen found very effective.\r\n\r\n_Caution._ There is a risk of mistaking the early stages of roup for\r\na simple cold. Further, birds are more likely to contract roup when\r\nsuffering from a cold, and should, on this account, be isolated and\r\nregularly examined.\r\n\r\n_Influenza._ The term influenza, or grippe, is generally applied to a\r\nsevere cold that has no symptoms of roup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CONSTIPATION\r\n\r\n                    _Not common and seldom serious_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The bird suffering is dull and listless. Its efforts to\r\nevacuate are painful and unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Internal blocking of the cloaca or the intestines, or,\r\noccasionally, of the vent by dirt accumulated on the outside. Want of\r\nexercise and lack of green food are held to be contributing causes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If constipation is due to dirt on the outside, cleanse\r\nvent by swabbing with warm water. When stoppage is inside and can be\r\nfelt through the vent syringe with sweet oil. In other cases, give a\r\npurgative such as castor oil or Epsom salts. If worms are suspected as\r\nthe cause, give santonin (see page 9), followed by a teaspoonful of\r\ncastor oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CRAMP\r\n\r\n          _Must not be confused with more serious complaints_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Difficulty in standing and lameness, due to inflammation of\r\nmuscles and joints.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Damp and cold.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Put legs of bird in warm water; rub joints with\r\nembrocation and put in dry quarters.\r\n\r\nNOTE—In cases of rheumatism, tick fever, and tuberculosis, birds may\r\nshow the same difficulty in standing that they do in cramp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CROP-BOUND (IMPACTION OF CROP)\r\n\r\n                       _Not serious, as a rule_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The crop is hard and swollen.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The blocking of the passage from the crop to the gizzard by a\r\nbit of stick or a stone, with the result that the food cannot pass out\r\nof the crop.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Pour sweet oil down fowl’s throat; work the crop with the\r\nfingers, endeavoring to remove the obstructing object. If unsuccessful,\r\ncut open the crop and remove the contents, making sure that the opening\r\ninto the gizzard is clear. Sew up the cut made, stitching separately\r\nfirst the inner skin and then the outer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DIARRHEA OR ENTERITIS\r\n\r\n                _May take a serious and epidemic form_\r\n\r\nDiarrhea is a common complaint among fowls, and in some cases takes\r\na severe and epidemic form. The latter form may be due to various\r\ncauses, and it will be best, perhaps, to deal with diarrhea under the\r\nfollowing heads:\r\n\r\n  1. Mild diarrhea.\r\n  2. Epidemic and severe diarrhea.\r\n  3. Dysentery. (See page 52.)\r\n  4. Cholera. (See page 39.)\r\n  5. White diarrhea of chickens. (See page 92.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mild Diarrhea_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Looseness of bowels and staining of feathers around the\r\nanus with excreta.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Indigestion caused by food which may be too laxative; e. g.,\r\nexcess of bran, or, by food which may be partly decomposed or may\r\ncontain an intestinal irritant. Cold may also be a cause.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Give Epsom salts, or castor oil. (See page 9.) Change diet\r\nif food is suspected. Often no treatment is necessary, but it is not\r\nwise to neglect cases that are apparently mild diarrhea, for fear they\r\nmay turn out to be an epidemic and contagious form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diarrhea, Severe and Epidemic_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Excessive looseness of bowels, ruffling of feathers,\r\ndepression, loss of appetite. A number of birds in the flock are\r\nattacked and death results.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ There are a variety of causes. Scientific investigation has\r\nled to the discovery of specific organisms responsible for various\r\nforms of diarrhea. It would be well for poultry rearers to study the\r\nresults of such work, but, for the purposes of this book, it will be\r\nsufficient to state that the causal organism may be bacterial, mycotic,\r\nor protozoan. The owner of poultry will not usually be able himself to\r\ndetermine what type of diarrhea the fowls are suffering from, but as\r\na rule the treatment will have to be the same. Advice will have to be\r\nsought from an expert when dangerous epidemics are feared.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The most energetic measures of disinfection must be\r\nundertaken. (See page 10.)\r\n\r\n 1. Isolate sick fowls.\r\n\r\n 2. Disinfect soil of run thoroughly.\r\n\r\n 3. Clean and disinfect coops.\r\n\r\n 4. In bad cases, remove the rest of the flock from the infested run.\r\n\r\n 5. Give sick fowls Epsom salts, or castor oil; feed fowls on soft food.\r\n\r\n 6. If the diarrhea is not checked, give 6 to 12 drops of chlorodyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DIPHTHERIA OR DIPHTHERITIC ROUP\r\n\r\n  _A dangerous disease, and infected birds should be killed at once_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A cold, accompanied by whitish and yellowish patches on\r\nthe back of the throat and in the mouth. These patches apparently form\r\na false membrane and cannot be torn off without causing bleeding. The\r\ndisease is sometimes known as canker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—DIPHTHERITIC ROUP\r\n_b_, lower beak; _t_, tongue; _m_, false membrane.\r\n(After Harrison and Streit.)]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ This disease is often clearly a later stage of roup. It is\r\ndifficult to say where one ends and the other begins. It has been\r\nclaimed that the organism is the same as that which causes diphtheria\r\nin human beings, but the weight of evidence is against this conclusion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Diphtheria is extremely infectious. It is best to kill\r\nthe first cases at once. If the bird is of particular value, it may\r\nbe isolated and the patches on the throat swabbed with 50% hydrogen\r\nperoxide or 5% creolin, with a small bit of cotton wool wound around\r\na stick. If great care is exercised, 20% carbolic acid or 20% creolin\r\nmay be painted on the patches, but neither should be allowed to touch\r\nthe normal skin. Burn the swabs. Treat accompanying roupy symptoms as\r\nrecommended under roup.\r\n\r\nThe term canker is also applied to certain spots or growths that occur\r\non the throat. These are not in any way associated with diphtheritic\r\nroup, or any dangerous, contagious disease, and are due to injury or to\r\nan unhealthy condition of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DROPSY\r\n\r\n                        _Not a common disease_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Distention of abdomen.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Collection of liquid in abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Treatment is seldom successful. It is best and most\r\nmerciful to kill the afflicted bird. If it is desired to make an effort\r\nto save the bird, carefully puncture the lower portion of the abdomen\r\nwith a trocar and squeeze out the liquid. Give invalid diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DYSENTERY\r\n\r\n                     _Serious if in epidemic form_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Severe diarrhea with blood in the discharges.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Bacterial or other specific infection of the intestines.\r\nOccasionally the eating of some poisonous or irritating substance will\r\ngive rise to blood in the excrement.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Isolate bird, and give six to eight drops of chlorodyne on\r\na small piece of bread. Thorough disinfection (see page 10) of water,\r\nsoil and house is necessary to prevent this disease spreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EGG-BOUND\r\n\r\n                        _An uncommon complaint_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The hen goes on and off the nest straining to lay.\r\nGenerally the egg may be felt through the vent. After straining for\r\nsome time, she may succeed in laying the egg, and treatment should not\r\nbe undertaken until it is evident that the fowl needs assistance.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Very young hens are more liable to this complaint, which\r\narises from eggs of an abnormal size, from lack of muscular power, or\r\nfrom some other disorder of the oviduct.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ It will be most merciful to kill fowls in much distress,\r\nas treatment is tedious and painful to the fowl. It has been\r\nrecommended to hold the fowl’s vent over steam from boiling water and\r\nthen to pass an oiled finger up the vent. In bad cases, pierce the\r\negg and withdraw the contents, then break the shell and remove all the\r\npieces. Great care must be taken to leave no particle of the broken\r\nshell behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EGG-EATING\r\n\r\n                 _A bad habit that may be controlled_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ If remains of eggs are seen in nests or runs, the\r\npoultryman should become suspicious and make observations to prove\r\nwhether any of his flock are eating eggs.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Broken eggs or soft-shelled eggs left about the yard may be\r\nthe cause of hens acquiring this bad habit.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ All signs of broken eggs should always be immediately\r\nremoved. The culprit, when detected, should be removed to a different\r\npen and nest. Dark nests have been recommended. A trap nest will\r\nprevent a hen from getting at her egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EMPHYSEMA (AIR UNDER SKIN)\r\n\r\n                  _Not a common disease of chickens_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In this disease of chickens the skin becomes puffed out in\r\none or more places, generally on the neck. In rare cases the puffing\r\nspreads over nearly the whole of the body.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ This disease is evidently caused by some obstruction of the\r\nair passages that forces the air to escape under the skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Let out the air by puncturing the skin. Give soft and\r\nnourishing food. It will probably be wiser not to use birds that\r\nrecover from this complaint for breeding stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EPILEPSY\r\n\r\n                        _An unusual complaint_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The bird staggers about and has a fit. It may recover.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ It is difficult to discover a cause; intestinal worms are\r\nsuspected in some cases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If it is suspected that intestinal worms are responsible,\r\ntry the treatment recommended for worms. (See page 95.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FATTY DEGENERATION\r\n\r\n            _Not contagious, but pointing to error in diet_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ More or less sudden deaths of birds in good condition.\r\nPost-mortem examination shows an enlarged liver and masses of fat\r\nattached to the intestines.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Something wrong with the diet; too much heat-giving food and\r\nwant of exercise.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_. Post-mortem proof of fatty degeneration in the flock\r\nshould lead the poultry owner to change the diet, reducing the amount\r\nof heat-giving food, and giving more exercise. Some authors draw\r\nattention to a fatty degeneration in which the liver is shrunken and\r\nshows fat globules under the microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FAVUS (WHITE COMB)\r\n\r\n         _Disfiguring, but easily controlled if treated early_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Whitish scabs or crusts on the comb, the head and down the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Due to a fungus that spreads, if not treated, and that\r\nprobably starts where there is an abrasion of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Treat in early stages of the disease by dressing with\r\nsulphur ointment. (See page 9.) Isolate bird. If the case has been\r\nneglected and allowed to develop, the crusts must first be moistened\r\nwith oil and the surface scraped off with a blunt instrument. Then\r\napply tincture of iodine or nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FEATHER-EATING\r\n\r\n                       _Not a very common habit_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The presence of bare patches and injured plumage on birds\r\nshould lead the poultryman to watch for feather-eaters.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Irritation from insects, some defect in diet, or natural\r\ncussedness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Isolate the offender, and, if persistent and of no special\r\nvalue, kill, for fear the bad example may be followed by others. If\r\nseveral fowls develop this vice, try hanging up a bone for them to peck\r\nat and thus distract their attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FLEAS\r\n\r\n                  _An occasional parasite of poultry_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Fleas are found on the fowls or in the straw of their nests.\r\n\r\n_Description._ The flea that attacks fowls is known as the hen flea\r\n(_Pulex gallinæ_). It is dark colored and has sharp mouth parts.\r\nDoubtless it causes the fowl it attacks much irritation in addition to\r\nloss of blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Keep poultry houses in a clean, sanitary condition. Dust\r\nthe infested fowls with an insect powder or dip them in creolin, about\r\n1%. Burn infested straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FRACTURES\r\n\r\nBroken bones of legs or wings can be mended by placing the bones back\r\nin their proper positions and binding with light splints. The splints\r\nmay be removed in about four weeks. It will be found that shanks are\r\neasily set, but that broken wings give far more trouble.\r\n\r\nIf a fowl dislocates its leg or its wing, the joint should be gently\r\npushed back into place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FROST BITE\r\n\r\n _A strain on the bird’s system_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Combs and wattles are most liable to frost bite,\r\nparticularly in breeds in which these parts are large.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Exposure to very low temperatures, especially if birds are\r\nsuddenly turned out from warm quarters; dipping comb and wattles in\r\nwater when the temperature is low.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Prevent by keeping birds as warm as possible during\r\nwinter, and do not allow them to go out early in the mornings in very\r\ncold weather. Drinking water should be provided in a vessel from which\r\nbirds can drink without wetting their wattles. In a case of frost bite,\r\nthaw the affected parts by gently rubbing with vaseline and afterwards\r\ntreat with a mixture of two grains of salicylic acid to one ounce of\r\nvaseline or lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GAPES\r\n\r\n _Serious in badly infested yards_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—GAPES\r\nOn left: Chicken affected with gapes. On right: _a_, male and female\r\ngape worms; _b_, gape worms in windpipe. (From Salmon.)]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Frequent gaping and coughing; young chicks attacked, as a\r\nrule. Notice if any worms are coughed up by the chicken; if none can\r\nbe found, but the gaping continues, put a stripped feather down the\r\nwindpipe, as recommended under treatment, and see if any gape worms can\r\nbe pulled up.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Small worms, red in color when engorged, which attach\r\nthemselves to the mucous membrane of the windpipe. Affected birds\r\ncough up worms or ova, which infect the yard and sometimes the water\r\nsupply. Earthworms taken from infested yards have been found to contain\r\nportions of gape worms, and may be one means of infecting poultry.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Isolate attacked poultry and disinfect coops and yards.\r\nThe worms may be extracted from the windpipe of a gaping chicken with\r\na feather stripped nearly to the end, and moistened, but not dripping,\r\nwith oil of turpentine. Hold the mouth open, push the feather down the\r\nwindpipe, and give it a sudden twist, which will dislodge the worms\r\nand allow of their being drawn up. Fumigation by holding the bird’s\r\nhead over an irritant vapor, such as that of carbolic acid poured into\r\nboiling water, is risky, but sometimes successful. If not cautiously\r\ndone, much suffering may be inflicted on the bird.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem._ Cut open the windpipe and look for the worms, which\r\nmay be easily recognized by Fig. 12. Male and female specimens will be\r\nfound attached to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GASTRITIS (CATARRH OF THE STOMACH)\r\n\r\n _Not a common complaint_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ This disease cannot be readily diagnosed while the fowl is\r\nliving; it is generally associated with catarrh of the crop. (See page\r\n37.) The symptoms are similar. Post-mortem examination will show the\r\nlining of the stomach in an inflamed condition.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The inflammation of the lining of the stomach is generally due\r\nto eating decomposing food or other poisonous matter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Empty the crop as recommended under Catarrh of the crop.\r\nGive one or two tablespoonfuls of castor oil and feed on soft and\r\neasily digested food with milk or barley water. Be sure that poultry\r\nare not allowed to run under trees that have been sprayed with\r\narsenical poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GOUT\r\n\r\n _Not a common ailment_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The bird sometimes loses weight, and as the disease\r\ndevelops shows stiffness and an indisposition to stand. In some cases\r\nsmall nodules containing crystals of urate of soda occur on the\r\nunderside of the toes.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Failure of the kidneys to perform their normal functions and\r\nconsequent accumulation of urates in the bird’s system in excessive\r\nquantities. Gout may be due to too concentrated feeding.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Medicines and treatment are of little avail. Endeavor to\r\nprevent by feeding a mixed diet.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem._ In one form of this disease, known as visceral gout, the\r\nliver and other abdominal organs are covered over with a powder-like\r\ndeposit of the crystals of urate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HEART DISEASES\r\n\r\n _Not common, and cannot be treated_\r\n\r\nThe heart is an organ that is subject to several serious diseases,\r\nbut these cannot be detected with any certainty while the bird is\r\nliving, and treatment cannot be recommended as likely to be successful.\r\nPost-mortem examination may show the following symptoms:\r\n\r\n 1. The heart sac full of serous liquid, in the case of pericarditis,\r\n or dropsy of the heart sac.\r\n\r\n 2. A reddening of the membrane lining the heart, in the case of\r\n inflammation (endocarditis).\r\n\r\n 3. An enlarged heart, in the case of enlargement of the heart.\r\n\r\n 4. Hemorrhage, in the case of rupture of the heart and of the blood\r\n vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INDIGESTION\r\n\r\n _Disorder of the intestinal tract, that is not very serious_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The bird mopes and shows signs of a capricious appetite.\r\nEither diarrhea or, less commonly, constipation, may be a symptom.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Disorders of the digestive tract, due to error in dieting—for\r\nexample, overfeeding, or too little green food and not enough exercise.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Alter the feeding, see that the water is clean, and give a\r\ndose of Epsom salts. (See page 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                               JAUNDICE\r\n\r\n _Not a common disease_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A yellow comb may indicate jaundice, but there are no\r\ndefinite external symptoms. Post-mortem examination shows distention of\r\nthe gall bladder, due to an excessive secretion of bile.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Said to be due to continued congestion of the liver, arising\r\npossibly from too much heat-giving food.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If the disease is suspected, give one grain of calomel as\r\na purgative and feed on more green food.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            KIDNEY DISEASES\r\n\r\n _With the exception of gout, kidney diseases cannot be detected by\r\n external symptoms_\r\n\r\nGout (see page 63) is the commonest disease of the kidneys. In\r\naddition, there are some disorders of the kidneys (e. g., enlargement)\r\nthat may be noticed on post-mortem examination. Little is known about\r\nthese diseases; there are no symptoms that can be recognized before\r\ndeath, and no treatment can be recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LEG WEAKNESS\r\n\r\n _Constitutional weakness, to which the heavier breeds are more subject\r\n than are the lighter ones_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Fowls walk in an unsteady manner, without showing any\r\nspecific cause for lameness. Young birds are more likely to be affected\r\nin this manner, particularly those of the heavier breeds.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Too rapid growth, the bird outgrowing the strength of its legs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Reduce the quantity of fat-producing foods. Care in the\r\nselection of breeding stock is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LICE\r\n\r\n _Invariably present in small numbers, and likely to become a serious\r\n pest, if not persistently controlled_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Unthrifty look of fowl and signs of irritation; desertion\r\nof nest by setting hens; and, of course, the detection of lice on the\r\nfowl: this may be done by quickly turning over the feathers on the body\r\nand looking for the lice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—LOOKING FOR LICE]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Introduction of an infested fowl; neglect to dust fowls\r\nregularly to keep down lice, and to clean out fowl houses and change\r\nthe straw of nest boxes. At the season that lice are likely to be most\r\nprevalent the poultryman should take precautionary measures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—THREE LICE THAT COMMONLY AFFECT FOWLS\r\n(From Salmon.)\r\n_a._ Lipeurus variabilis.\r\n_b_, Menopon pallidum.\r\n_c_, Goniodes dissimilis.]\r\n\r\n_Description of lice._ Lice are small insects ranging in size from\r\n1∕25 to 1∕8 of an inch. They breed rapidly, laying their eggs on the\r\nfeathers. They are not blood-sucking insects, but cause much irritation\r\nto the birds they infest.\r\n\r\nSeveral species are found on fowls. Fig. 14 shows three of the common\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Dust fowls with fresh insect powder (pyrethrum). Smear\r\nsulphur ointment on head and under wings, especially in the case of\r\nchickens. Infested fowls may be dipped in 2% creolin. Dust setting hens\r\nwith a lice powder before putting them on their nests. Infested straw\r\nshould be burnt, and boxes, nests, fixtures, etc., should be thoroughly\r\nsprayed with 2% creolin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LIMBER-NECK\r\n\r\n _An occasional complaint_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The muscles of the fowl’s neck become so relaxed that they\r\ncannot support the head.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Limber-neck, due to partial or entire paralysis of the muscles\r\nof the neck, is believed to be associated with acute indigestion or\r\nworms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ A strong purgative may be the means of effecting a cure by\r\ncleaning out any intestinal poisons and thus correcting the cause. If\r\nthe treatment recommended does not effect a cure in a few days, kill\r\nthe bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LIVER DISEASES\r\n\r\nThe liver is affected by several diseases, and the poultryman, who\r\nfinds a spotted liver on post-mortem examination, will be much aided\r\nin determining the cause, if he takes into consideration the symptoms\r\nnoticed before the fowl died, as well as the changes in the other\r\ninternal organs. The importance of the post-mortem examination is in\r\ndistinguishing whether the death of the fowl is due to a contagious\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe causes of diseased livers may be conveniently divided into two\r\nclasses:\r\n\r\n 1. Diseased livers due to indigestion, e. g., enlargement.\r\n\r\n 2. Diseased livers due to a specific disease, e. g., tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diseases Due to Indigestion_\r\n\r\nIn this class may be included degeneration, inflammation, congestion,\r\nenlargement, and atrophy of the liver. There are more or less distinct\r\ndifferences in these diseases, but the only possible methods of\r\ntreatment known at present are very much the same.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ There are no definite external symptoms. The poultryman’s\r\nsuspicions should, however, be aroused if fowls apparently in good\r\nhealth die suddenly. A post-mortem examination will reveal a liver of\r\nabnormal size, or somewhat shrunken, and of unhealthy texture.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The cause is generally something wrong in the feeding. Fowls\r\nmay be eating too large a proportion of heat-producing foods and not\r\nenough green food. If an enlarged liver is associated with an excessive\r\nlayer of fat covering the internal organs, it points to too large\r\nquantities of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Correct errors in feeding. Give more green food and let\r\nthe fowls scratch for some of their grain. If errors in feeding and\r\ngeneral management are not obvious, make experimental changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diseased Livers Due to Specific Diseases_\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, coccidiosis, gout and other specific diseases are\r\nresponsible for spotted or diseased livers. (Fig. 24.) The section on\r\ndiagnosis by post-mortem examination gives further information on these\r\nsubjects and shows how the principal diseases may be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe term cancer is sometimes applied to cases in which there are tumors\r\non the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MAGGOTS\r\n\r\n _Occasionally found in flesh wounds of poultry_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A flesh wound that instead of healing develops into a sore\r\nwith a slight running. On examination, maggots will be found.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Several species of flies are always ready to lay their eggs\r\nin any available wound or sore; therefore wounds must be watched in\r\nthe case of poultry, as with all other animals of the farmyard. The\r\neggs laid by these flies hatch and develop into small footless grubs\r\ncommonly known as maggots.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Wash the wound with 1 to 2% creolin; remove as many of\r\nthe maggots as possible with a pair of tweezers or a feather. If the\r\nmaggots are deep-seated, stuff the wound with a cotton wad saturated\r\nwith strong creolin or 10% carbolic acid. Examine next day and remove\r\ndead maggots. Treat again in a similar manner if the maggots are not\r\nall killed. Fish oil, or iodoform made into a paste with vaseline, will\r\nprevent the flies depositing their eggs, if smeared on the surface of\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MITES (AIR-SAC)\r\n\r\n _Not a common parasite_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ There are no definite external symptoms. If the bird is\r\nvery badly affected, there may be evidences of suffocation. This may\r\nend fatally. A post-mortem examination will show the mites in the air\r\npassages and bronchi as small yellowish and whitish particles, which on\r\ncareful observation may be seen to move.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A small mite (_Sarcoptes lævis_) which infests the air sacs\r\nand bronchi. These mites, when present in large numbers, obstruct\r\nthe air passages and cause suffocation. A secretion from the mucous\r\nmembrane affected, results from the presence of the mites and increases\r\nthe obstruction of the air passages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15 THE AIR SAC MITE\r\n(From Salmon.)]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The fumigation method tried for gapes has been\r\nrecommended, but there is little reason to expect success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MITES, DEPLUMING (SCABIES)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Bare patches on the bird’s body due to the loss of\r\nfeathers. The rump and the breast are most frequently attacked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16 THE DEPLUMING MITE\r\n(From Salmon.)]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A small mite (_Sarcoptes lævis_) found on the bird’s body near\r\nthe base of the fallen feathers.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Isolate affected birds; rub bare patches and neighboring\r\nportion of body with sulphur ointment (see page 9) or dip body of fowl\r\nin a solution of about 2% creolin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MITES (RED MITE)\r\n\r\n_A serious pest_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Unthriftiness of birds.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A small whitish mite, which appears red when filled with\r\nblood. These mites suck the bird’s blood at night and hide during the\r\nday in the sockets of the perches and in the crevices of the woodwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.   THE RED MITE]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Examine the fowl house at night. Dust hens with an insect\r\npowder; thoroughly spray houses and perches with 5% creolin or other\r\ndisinfectant, and squirt kerosene oil or turpentine into cracks and\r\ncrevices. A specially constructed mite-proof perch, or one that can be\r\neasily removed, should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MOLTING\r\n\r\nMolting is not a disease, but may prove trying to poultry not in the\r\nbest condition to stand the strain of the process. Hens overtaxed with\r\nforced laying and cocks running with too large a number of hens are\r\nmost likely to suffer. Molting occurs in healthy adult birds every\r\ntwelve months. The process, which is a natural one, should be allowed\r\nto take its natural course unless the fowls appear weak and depressed\r\nduring the period. In such cases specially nourishing and stimulating\r\nfood should be given. Anyhow, it would be well to pay particular\r\nattention to the feeding of birds during the molting season.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OVARY DISEASES\r\n\r\nHens suffer from various diseases of the ovary, which may become\r\nshriveled and useless or gangrenous. Tumorous growths, sometimes called\r\ncancers, are also found. As diseased conditions of this organ can be\r\ndetected only by post-mortem examination, and as no remedies are known,\r\nthe subject need not be dealt with more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         OVIDUCT, DISEASES OF\r\n\r\nAbnormal eggs must be regarded as due to functional disorders of the\r\noviduct. One cause of soft eggs is lack of shell-forming material;\r\ntherefore a liberal supply of powdered oyster shells, or lime in some\r\nother form, should always be accessible to laying hens. Other abnormal\r\neggs occur, such as those with double yolks, without any yolk, with\r\nblood clots, etc. No treatment can be suggested beyond feeding a varied\r\ndiet and avoiding too stimulating or over-heating foods.\r\n\r\nProlapse of the oviduct may occur. The protruding portion should be\r\noiled or vaselined and gently pressed back.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PERITONITIS\r\n\r\n _Not common and not contagious_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Loss of appetite, fever and evidence of discomfort and pain\r\nin the stomach, especially if the abdomen is pressed with the hand.\r\nPost-mortem examination shows inflamed appearance of membrane of the\r\nabdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION OF THE HEN\r\n(From Salmon.)\r\n\r\n_a._ Undeveloped ovules in ovary.\r\n\r\n_b._ Partly developed ovule showing stigma. Here the follicle wall\r\nbreaks and allows the ovule yolk to leave the ovary preparatory to\r\nlaying.\r\n\r\n_c._ An empty follicle in which the stigma and the yolk passed out.\r\n\r\n_d._ Opening of oviduct.\r\n\r\n_e._ Portion of oviduct distended, allowing yolk to pass down.\r\n\r\n_f._ Walls of oviduct which secrete albumen forming the white of the\r\negg.\r\n\r\n_g._ Membranous lining added.\r\n\r\n_h._ Portion of oviduct that secretes shell-forming substance.\r\n\r\n_i._ Cloaca.]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Serious inflammation of the wall of the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Put the bird in a quiet place. Aconite (see page 9), to\r\nreduce the temperature, and opium, or one drop of laudanum, to relieve\r\npain, have been recommended, but as a rule it is best to kill the bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PIP\r\n\r\n _Generally the effect of some other disorder_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A hardened scale formed at tip of tongue.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Generally due to cold or other disorder affecting the\r\nbreathing of the bird.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Do not try to tear off the growth on the tongue by force,\r\nbut moisten with vaseline or glycerin until it becomes loose. Give soft\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PNEUMONIA AND CONGESTION OF LUNGS\r\n\r\n _Generally fatal_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Extreme depression and great difficulty in breathing.\r\nDifficult to distinguish in the living bird from a very bad cold.\r\nPost-mortem examination shows the affected lung filled with an exudate.\r\nThe lung sinks if put in water.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Following on a cold, the lung becomes congested with blood\r\nand a dark, viscous matter. Pneumonia may be considered a further, and\r\ngenerally final, stage of congestion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ A cure is seldom effected, but in the case of a valuable\r\nbird the following treatment may be tried Keep the bird in a dry, warm\r\nplace; paint the skin above the lungs with tincture of iodine; give\r\naconite. Feed on soft food and give a stimulant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POISONING\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ As a rule the poisons that fowls eat are mineral. The most\r\npronounced symptom is evidence of pain. In cases of arsenical poison\r\nthere is diarrhea. A poison containing a copper compound acts partly\r\nas an emetic, causing the fowl to make an effort to vomit. In cases\r\nof mineral poisons, post-mortem examinations show inflammation of the\r\nstomach and the digestive tract.\r\n\r\n_Sources of poison._ Poultry are likely to get poisoned from the\r\nfollowing sources:\r\n\r\n_Fertilizers_ (e. g., nitrate of soda) used on fields in which fowls\r\nscratch for food. Such cases are rare.\r\n\r\n_Insecticides and fungicides_ (e. g., Paris green [arsenic], lead\r\narsenate, Bordeaux mixture) applied to plants under which fowls run. If\r\nsprays are mixed in correct proportions and used in normal quantities,\r\nthere is little danger to poultry feeding on the grass below sprayed\r\ntrees. Great care should, however, be taken in disposing of the\r\nsediment and the residue after spraying operations are completed.\r\n\r\n_Rat poisons_ (e. g., phosphorus, strychnine, baryta). These poisons\r\nare particularly dangerous when mixed with cornmeal or other bait\r\nattractive to fowls. The best way to set rat poison is to put it in a\r\npiece of piping of such a diameter and length that fowls cannot reach\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Salt._ Food mixed with salt for other domestic animals may be\r\naccidentally given to fowls. Chickens are the most likely to be\r\npoisoned by excess of salt.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If fowls have eaten poisonous substances, the fact is\r\nnot usually discovered until after death or until it is too late to\r\nadminister an antidote. Most of the poisons fowls are likely to eat act\r\nas irritants of the digestive tract. Milk and white of egg should be\r\ngiven. It is advisable to give a stimulant, such as half a teaspoonful\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PYÆMIA\r\n\r\n _Not contagious, and not common_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ This disease cannot be diagnosed except by post-mortem\r\nexamination and microscopic identification of pus-forming organisms in\r\nthe infected areas (whitish spots) of liver, spleen, etc.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Pus-forming organisms believed to enter the blood through a\r\nwound in the skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ As there are no external symptoms, treatment is not\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RHEUMATISM\r\n\r\n _Not a common trouble_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Lameness and stiffness of joints.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ May be due in some cases to too stimulating food and to\r\ndampness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Put affected bird in dry quarters and vary food, adding\r\nmore greens. Rub joints with embrocation, or turpentine and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ROUP (CONTAGIOUS CATARRH)\r\n\r\n _One of the most serious contagious diseases_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The bird first has symptoms of an ordinary cold, such as\r\nrunning at the nostrils and sneezing. Definite evidence of roup is the\r\n_offensive odor_ detected on opening the bird’s mouth. The exudate is\r\nalso offensive. The disease may attack the eyes, which then become\r\ninflamed and swollen; a tumor, containing offensive, yellowish, cheesy\r\nmatter, sometimes develops. The course of the disease may extend over\r\nseveral weeks or months and there may be cases of chronic roup. Some\r\ncases end fatally in a comparatively short time. The form of the\r\ndisease, in which yellowish patches develop on the throat, is dealt\r\nwith under diphtheria or diphtheritic roup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—EXAMINING A FOWL WITH A SUSPICIOUS COLD]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Cases of roup occur when birds are subjected to draft and\r\ndamp, but the cause must be infection with disease germs. It is\r\nbelieved that the almost constant presence of the germs is due to lack\r\nof regular disinfection and to birds in the flock believed to have\r\nrecovered from a previous attack of the disease, but that, in reality,\r\nare suffering from chronic roup, and are able, whenever suitable\r\nconditions arise for an outbreak of this disease, to infect the rest of\r\nthe flock through the drinking water and the soil.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The seriousness of this disease makes it imperative\r\nfor the poultry rearer to isolate immediately any birds showing any\r\nsuspicious symptoms. If treatment of the infected bird is taken in\r\nhand early, and carried out faithfully, a cure can be effected, but it\r\nis often wiser to kill and burn infected stock. In treating birds,\r\nthe mouth and nostrils should be washed out with 5% carbolic acid, or\r\nwith 50% hydrogen peroxide, or with 2% permanganate of potash. It is\r\nimportant to clean out the passage of the nostrils, and this may be\r\ndone by:\r\n\r\n 1. Pressing against the roof of the bird’s mouth from inside and\r\n squeezing the nostrils from above downwards.\r\n\r\n 2. Syringing out the nostrils.\r\n\r\n 3. Dipping the fowl’s head for a few seconds in a solution of the\r\n disinfectant. Great care should be exercised in this method of\r\n treatment, which is only recommended when permanganate of potash is\r\n used.\r\n\r\nIt is well to keep birds isolated for some time after apparent\r\nrecovery. When the eye is affected (see Fig. 20), the tumor should be\r\ncarefully lanced and the cheesy matter removed, after which the cavity\r\nshould be rinsed out with one of the disinfectants recommended above;\r\nsuch treatment may have to be repeated time after time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—A ROUPY EYE]\r\n\r\nAs an after effect of a cold or of roup, conjunctivitis or sore eyes\r\nmay develop. A discharge comes from the eyes and the eyelids become\r\nstuck together. Bathe the eyes with hydrogen peroxide mixed with an\r\nequal quantity of water.\r\n\r\nIf this condition follows an attack of roup, there is danger that the\r\nfowl has not entirely recovered, and may be a source of infection to\r\nthe rest of the flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SCALY LEG\r\n\r\n _An unsightly affection that, although contagious, does not spread\r\n rapidly_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A rough and scaly growth on the legs of the bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—SCALY LEG\r\nA. Showing early stages of attack.]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ A small mite (Fig. 22), known as _Sarcoptes mutans_, burrows\r\nin the skin and gives rise to the unsightly growth (Fig. 21) that gives\r\nthis disease its name.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Soften the scaly growth by washing and soaking the legs\r\nwith warm water and soap. Scrub the affected portion of the legs\r\nwith a brush and then treat as follows: Dip the legs in kerosene oil,\r\nholding them there for not longer than a few seconds. If the kerosene\r\noil is mixed with sweet oil, or if the legs are wet first with water,\r\nthere will be no risk of the kerosene proving harsh, as sometimes\r\nhappens. Sulphur ointment (see page 9) may be used instead of the\r\nkerosene oil treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.-THE MITE THAT CAUSES SCALY LEG]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SOFT CROP\r\n\r\n _Not a serious complaint_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Distended crop, soft to the feel.\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Over-eating; or food turning sour in the crop.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Hold bird downwards and squeeze contents of crop through\r\nmouth, taking care not to suffocate the patient. Repeat treatment if\r\nnecessary. Put on low diet for some time, feeding slowly and sparingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TICKS\r\n\r\n _A pest found in the Southern States and tropical countries_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The fowl has fever, appears depressed, and stands in a\r\ncramped position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. THE FOWL TICK\r\n_a._ Adult.\r\n_b._ Larva.]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The fowl tick (_Argas minatus_), which hides during the day in\r\ncracks and crevices, sucks the fowl’s blood at night and introduces a\r\nfever-producing parasite.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ Examine sick birds during the day, and visit the roosts\r\nat night, for proof of the presence of ticks; carefully search under\r\nperches, in nests, and in corners of woodwork, etc. Spray woodwork\r\nwith 5% creolin; squirt kerosene oil, or turpentine, into cracks and\r\ncrevices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\n _A very serious poultry disease_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ This disease may be present in a poultry yard for some time\r\nwithout being detected. Suspicion should be aroused if birds gradually\r\nlose weight and die. If a bird that has gradually been getting thinner,\r\ngoes lame, or loses the use of a wing, without apparent injury, the\r\nevidence that tuberculosis is present is strong, but positive proof\r\nof its presence can be obtained only by post-mortem and microscopic\r\nexamination. This disease generally attacks adult birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—ORGANS AFFECTED BY TUBERCULOSIS AND BLACKHEAD\r\n_a._ Normal spleen.\r\n_b._ Tubercular spleen.\r\n_c._ Portion of tubercular liver.\r\n_d._ Blackhead liver of turkey for comparison with _c_.\r\n_a_ and _b_ after Edwards.]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ The specific organism causing this disease, known as the\r\n_Bacillus tuberculosis_ (Fig. 5), infects the liver (Fig. 24), the\r\nspleen (Fig. 24), and other organs, least frequently the lungs. The\r\ndisease may be introduced into a flock by the purchase of an infected\r\nbird, and may be spread by uninfected birds picking up the excrement of\r\ndiseased birds with their food.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ There is no known cure. The insidious manner in which\r\nthis disease advances through a poultry yard makes it a very serious\r\nmalady. Birds suffering from it should be killed and burnt. Thorough\r\ndisinfection of coops, etc., should be made. Strict attention to\r\nsanitation will help in preventing and controlling this disease. If\r\nmany birds in a flock are believed to have tuberculosis, it would be\r\nwell to destroy the whole flock and start again, preferably on fresh\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WHITE DIARRHEA OF CHICKENS\r\n\r\n _A very serious disease, causing the death of large numbers_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Chickens are generally attacked when 10 to 15 days old.\r\nThey appear listless, their feathers become rough, and they stand about\r\nwith drooping wings. A white diarrhea is soon noticed. Chicken after\r\nchicken shows similar symptoms and dies, resulting in much loss and\r\ndiscouragement to the poultry rearer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—CHICKENS AFFECTED WITH WHITE DIARRHEA\r\nTen-day White Leghorn chickens showing symptoms of bacillary white\r\ndiarrhea. (After Rettger & Stoneburn.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—HEALTHY CHICKENS\r\nNormal ten-day White Leghorn chickens. (After Rettger & Stoneburn.)]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Various causes, such as improper or stale food, may upset the\r\nchicken’s digestive organs and give rise to a whitish diarrhea, but\r\nthe term “white diarrhea” is best restricted to a contagious form of\r\ndiarrhea due to minute parasites in the intestinal tracts of chickens.\r\nA coccidium and a bacillus have been proved by different investigators\r\nto cause very similar forms of white diarrhea. A distinct form of white\r\ndiarrhea, known as brooder pneumonia, is described on page 35.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ This disease is a very difficult one to control.\r\nIncubators and brooders should be thoroughly disinfected. Special care\r\nshould be taken in the feeding during the first few weeks. Chickens\r\nshould not be overfed. The feeding of dry bran is recommended, as it\r\ntends to keep the bowels in a healthy, active condition. In the form\r\nof white diarrhea due to a bacillus, suspicion rests on the hen and\r\nthe egg as sources of infection. When the disease becomes serious, and\r\ngeneral sanitation and proper care of chickens do not control it, the\r\nadvisability of obtaining the eggs for hatching from a poultry farm\r\nfree of white diarrhea should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 WORMS\r\n\r\n _Intestinal parasites that occasionally become serious_\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ General debility; worms or segments of worms; seen in\r\nthe droppings. If there is doubt as to whether a flock is suffering\r\nfrom worms, give a suspected bird a strong purgative and keep it up so\r\nthat the feces may be examined for worms. If doubt still exists, the\r\nsuspected bird should be killed and a post-mortem examination made.\r\nCut the intestines open lengthways (see Fig. 34) with a small pair\r\nof scissors and wash them out with water so as to detect the smaller\r\nworms, and the tapeworms attached to the lining of the intestines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—WORMS IN INTESTINAL TRACT OF FOWL\r\n(After Bradshaw. From Pearl, Surface & Curtis.)]\r\n\r\n_Cause._ Two classes of worms are commonly parasitic on fowls—round\r\nworms (see Fig. 27) and tapeworms. There are generally a few specimens\r\nof worms in the intestines of fowls; but only when the numbers are\r\nlarge do worms affect the health of the fowl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—THE PARTS OF A FOWL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—SKELETON OF A FOWL]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Every bird suspected of having worms may be tested with\r\na purgative as suggested above. Or, if it is established that several\r\nbirds in a flock are suffering from worms, all in poor condition,\r\nwithout any cause being apparent, should be dosed with santonin—three\r\nto five grains in the morning before any food has been picked up. After\r\nabout two hours give a purgative of two teaspoonfuls of castor oil and\r\nsoon after let the fowl have its morning food. As important as dosing\r\nthe fowls, is disinfecting the feed troughs, the water vessels, and the\r\nsoil of the runs in order to prevent re-infection.\r\n\r\n_Nodular tæniasis._ Small nodules on the intestines, resembling the\r\nnodules in tuberculosis, are sometimes caused by tapeworms. The name\r\n“nodular tæniasis” has been given to this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                       POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_1. Making the Examination_\r\n\r\nA post-mortem examination should always be undertaken if there is any\r\ndoubt as to the cause of death. Poultry rearers who are not already\r\nfamiliar with the normal appearance of the internal organs of a fowl\r\nshould take the first opportunity of studying them.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem examinations should be done in a systematic manner; but, if\r\ndesired, a very speedy examination may be made by rapidly removing, or\r\nbending back, the breast bone of the unplucked bird.\r\n\r\nIt will be more generally satisfactory, however, to devote time to the\r\noperation, and it is suggested that the work be carried out on the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n 1. Nail the body of the dead fowl on a board in the position shown\r\n in Fig. 30, having first partly or wholly plucked the bird.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 30.—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 1\r\n Fowl nailed on board; lines A B, A C and B D show where to cut.]\r\n\r\n 2. With a sharp knife cut along lines AC, BD (Fig. 30), and bend the\r\n breast bone backwards, exposing the internal organs. (Fig. 31.) As\r\n the breast bone is raised it will be necessary to cut through the\r\n mesentery and other connecting tissues. Break it back at D, cutting\r\n through the flesh and the muscle with sharp scissors.\r\n\r\n 3. Remove heart, liver, gall-bladder and spleen, making neat\r\n severances and without injury to any of the other organs. If the heart\r\n or large blood vessels be injured in the operation, blood will flow\r\n out and interfere with the work.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 31.—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 2\r\n Breast bone removed; internal organs in situ.]\r\n\r\n 4. Cut through the œsophagus, below or above the crop, as most\r\n convenient, and also cut through the large intestine near the\r\n cloaca. Without disconnecting the parts, lift out the gizzard,\r\n intestines, and other portions of the alimentary canal, carefully\r\n tearing away the membranous tissues of the mesentery.\r\n\r\n 5. Spread the organs out and examine each one carefully and\r\n critically, making sections if necessary. (Fig. 32.)\r\n\r\n 6. Cut open gullet, crop, stomach, gizzard, intestines, and cæca and\r\n examine the contents.\r\n\r\n 7. Examine the lungs, cutting off a portion and throwing it into\r\n water, when it will float if healthy, but sink if congested.\r\n\r\n 8. Cut through the skin of the neck. Sever the windpipe near the head,\r\n and also where the bronchi enter the lungs. With scissors cut it open,\r\n and examine for molds or gapes or for exudates indicative of various\r\n forms of cold or lung congestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 3\r\nInternal organs removed for examination.]\r\n\r\n\r\n 9. Examine the brain (Fig. 34) for blood clots. Some care will be\r\n necessary in cutting through the skull so as not to injure the brain\r\n tissue, which should be a milky white. A sharp and strong pair of\r\n scissors or a small, fine saw (e. g., tenon saw) will be useful for\r\n older birds. Remove the skin and cut from behind, raising the bones\r\n and exposing the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2. The Normal Condition of the Internal Organs_\r\n\r\n(See Fig. 32.)\r\n\r\nThe _œsophagus_ carries the food from the mouth and passing down the\r\nneck beside the windpipe opens into—\r\n\r\nThe _crop_, where the food is macerated. Thence it gradually passes\r\ninto—\r\n\r\nThe _true stomach_ (or proventriculus), which is lined with small\r\ngastric-secreting glands that may be seen with the naked eye. This\r\norgan is hidden by the liver, and opens directly into—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 4\r\nLungs, kidneys, etc., in situ.]\r\n\r\nThe _gizzard_, situated on the left side of the abdomen. It rests on\r\nthe coiled-up mass of intestines. It is dark red and is partly hidden\r\nby the left lobe of the liver. The walls are strong and muscular. Here\r\nthe food is ground against small bits of stone, etc. The partially\r\ndigested food passes out through an aperture near the entrance of the\r\ntrue stomach into—\r\n\r\nThe _duodenum_ or upper portion of the small intestine. It forms a loop\r\nthat incloses—\r\n\r\nThe _pancreas_, a compact, flattened organ, pinkish in color, that\r\ndischarges its secretion by three ducts into the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe _small intestine_, after forming the loop (duodenum), continues its\r\ncourse. It first passes toward the left and is disposed in many folds\r\nconnected by the mesentery; toward the end it passes up behind the true\r\nstomach. Connected to the intestines are the blind bodies known as—\r\n\r\nThe _cæca_, connected to the small intestines for several inches and\r\nwhich, after becoming considerably smaller in diameter, enter the\r\nalimentary tract where—\r\n\r\nThe _large intestine_ (rectum) starts. This portion of the intestines\r\nis short and enters—\r\n\r\nThe _cloaca_, into which the urinary and reproductive ducts discharge.\r\nThe external opening is known as the _vent_ or _anus_.\r\n\r\nThe _brain_, situated in the back of the head, is protected by the\r\ncranial bones. It is milky white except where the blood vessels may be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe _windpipe_ connects the larynx at the throat with the lungs\r\nbranching into the two _bronchi_.\r\n\r\nThe _lungs_, situated in the upper portion of the thoracic abdominal\r\ncavity, are firmly attached to the ribs, in the interspaces between\r\nwhich they fit. They are flattened and oval in shape, bright red in\r\ncolor, and loose and spongy in texture.\r\n\r\nThe _heart_ is cone-shaped. The lower portion rests between the\r\nlobes of the liver. The heart is red and is inclosed in a sac (the\r\npericardium) that is easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe _liver_, situated a little lower down than the heart, consists\r\nof two lobes. The right lobe is often larger than the left which may\r\nbe cleft at the lower end. The left lobe covers the true stomach and\r\npart of the gizzard. If there is some delay in holding a post-mortem\r\nexamination the edges of the lobes of the liver become discolored.\r\nNormally the color is a purplish red.\r\n\r\nThe _gall bladder_ fits into a shallow depression on the underside of\r\nthe right lobe of the liver and appears green in color. A duct conveys\r\nthe bile from the liver into the gall bladder, whence it passes by\r\nanother duct into the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe _spleen_, a nearly round, reddish body, with a purplish tinge, is\r\nattached by a ligament to the right side of the true stomach and is\r\nhidden by the liver.\r\n\r\nThe _kidneys_ extend along the sides of the spine from immediately\r\nbelow the lungs to near the termination of the abdominal cavity. The\r\ngeneral color is a chocolate red, but a small portion at the upper end\r\n(known as the adrenal), is yellow. There is no urinary bladder. The\r\nurates are carried direct through the _ureters_ to the cloaca.\r\n\r\nThe _testes_ (of the male bird) are attached to the upper portion\r\nof the kidneys. They are white or very light-colored, and may be of\r\ndifferent sizes.\r\n\r\nThe _ovary_ (of the female bird), situated on the left side, covers the\r\nkidney on that side. It consists of numerous ova of various sizes\r\neach of which may develop into an egg. As an ovum passes through the\r\noviduct it is first coated with an albuminous covering (the white of\r\negg); lower down it is coated with a calcareous deposit that forms the\r\nshell of the egg. (Fig. 18.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 5\r\nExamination of brain and of portions of intestines and windpipe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_3. Diagnosis of Disease by Post-Mortem Symptoms_\r\n\r\nFor purposes of diagnosis each organ must be examined. Note in each\r\ncase if it is enlarged, spotted, ruptured, inflamed or engorged with\r\nblood. Observe if it is an unusual color or if it possesses any other\r\nsymptom of an abnormal character.\r\n\r\nA single symptom in a single organ, unless very pronounced and\r\ncharacteristic, will not be sufficient evidence for forming an accurate\r\nopinion as to the cause of death. But if the condition of the other\r\norgans and the symptoms before and attending death are taken into\r\nconsideration, there will seldom be any difficulty, from a practical\r\nstandpoint, in deciding upon the nature of the disease. Many points\r\ncan be decided only by a pathologist with the aid of a microscope,\r\nsuch, for example, as the difference between coccidial and bacterial\r\ndiarrhea, but it is quite enough for the poultryman to realize that one\r\nof his fowls has died of an attack of an acute form of diarrhea and\r\nthat the rest of his birds may become infected.\r\n\r\nThe following notes draw attention to the main diagnostic symptoms\r\nobservable on post-mortem examination, arranged under the heading of\r\nthe organs affected. Other symptoms are put in parentheses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         POST-MORTEM SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\n                                 BRAIN\r\n\r\n_Apoplexy._—Shown by congestion of blood vessels of brain.

There is no subject of more vital importance to the\r\nfarmer than that of the best method of maintaining the fertility of the\r\nsoil. The very evident decrease in the fertility of those soils which\r\nhave been under cultivation for a number of years, combined with the\r\nincreased competition and the advanced price of labor, have convinced\r\nthe intelligent farmer that the agriculture of the future must be\r\nbased upon more rational practices than those which have been followed\r\nin the past. We have felt for some time that there was a place for a\r\nbrief, and at the same time comprehensive, treatise on this important\r\nsubject of Soil Fertility. Professor Vivian’s experience as a teacher\r\nin the short winter courses has admirably fitted him to present this\r\nmatter in a popular style. In this little book he has given the gist\r\nof the subject in plain language, practically devoid of technical and\r\nscientific terms. It is pre-eminently a “First Book,” and will be found\r\nespecially valuable to those who desire an introduction to the subject,\r\nand who intend to do subsequent reading.
