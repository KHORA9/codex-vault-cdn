At home\r\nhis career was not hampered by serious difficulties or blocked by\r\nformidable obstacles; not a few circumstances were distinctly favourable\r\nto success. Thus his biography cannot offer the reader either the\r\nexcitement of adventure, or the interest of an unwearied struggle with\r\nadverse conditions. But for all that, as it seems to me, it can teach a\r\nlesson of no little value. Lyell, while still a young man, determined\r\nthat he would endeavour to put geology--then only beginning to rank as a\r\nscience--on a more sound and philosophical basis. To accomplish this\r\npurpose, he spared no labour, grudged no expenditure, shrank from no\r\nfatigue. For years he was training himself by observation and travel; he\r\nwas studiously aiming at precision of thought and expression, till \"The\r\nPrinciples of Geology\" had been completed and published. But even then,\r\nthough he might have counted his work done, he spared no pains to make\r\nit better, and went on at the task of improvement till the close of his\r\nlong life.\r\n\r\nMy chief aim, in writing this little volume, has been to bring out this\r\nlesson as strongly and as clearly as possible. I have striven to show\r\nhow Charles Lyell studied, how he worked, how he accumulated\r\nobservations, how each journey had its definite purposes. Accordingly, I\r\nhave often given his words in preference to any phrases of my own, and\r\nhave quoted freely from his letters, diaries, and books, because I\r\nwished to show exactly how things presented themselves to his eyes, and\r\nhow ideas were maturing in his mind. Regarded in this light, Lyell's\r\nlife becomes an apologue, setting forth the beneficial results of\r\nconcentrating the whole energy on one definite object, and the moral\r\ngrandeur of a calm, judicial, truth-seeking spirit.\r\n\r\nIn writing the following pages I have, of course, mainly drawn upon the\r\n\"Life, Letters, and Journals,\" edited by Mrs. Lyell; but I have also\r\nmade use of his books, especially the \"Principles of Geology,\" and the\r\ntwo tours in North America. I am under occasional obligations to the\r\nexcellent life, contributed by Professor G. A. J. Cole to the\r\n\"Dictionary of National Biography,\" and have to thank my friend\r\nProfessor J. W. Judd for some important details which he had learnt\r\nthrough his intimacy with the veteran geologist. He also kindly lent the\r\nengraving (executed in America from a daguerreotype) which has been\r\ncopied for the frontispiece of this volume.\r\n\r\n T. G.

Among the most remarkable of the former is Charles\r\nLyell, who was born in Forfarshire on November 14th, 1797, at Kinnordy,\r\nthe family mansion. His father, who also bore the name of Charles,[1]\r\nwas both a lover of natural history and a man of high culture. He took\r\nan interest at one time in entomology, but abandoned this for botany,\r\ndevoting himself more especially to the study of the cryptogams. Of\r\nthese he discovered several new species, besides some other plants\r\npreviously unknown in the British flora, and he contributed the article\r\non Lichens to Smith's \"English Botany.\" More than one species was named\r\nafter him, as well as a genus of mosses, _Lyellia_, which is chiefly\r\nfound in the Himalayas. Later in his life, science, on the whole, was\r\nsupplanted by literature, and he became engrossed in the study of the\r\nworks of Dante, of some of whose poems[2] he published translations and\r\nnotes. Thus the geologist and author is an instance of \"hereditary\r\ngenius.\"\r\n\r\nCharles was the eldest of a family of ten--three sons and seven\r\ndaughters, all of whom grew up. Their mother was English, the daughter\r\nof Thomas Smith, of Maker Hall in Yorkshire, \"a woman of strong sense\r\nand tender anxiety for her children's welfare.\" \"The front of heaven,\"\r\nas Lyell has written in a fragment of autobiography, was not \"full of\r\nfiery shapes at his nativity,\" but the season was so exceptionally warm\r\nthat his mother's bedroom-window was kept open all the night--an\r\nappropriate birth-omen for the geologist, who had a firmer faith than\r\nsome of his successors in the value of work in the open air. He has put\r\non record only two characteristics of his infancy, and as these can\r\nhardly be personal recollections, we may assume them to have been\r\nsufficiently marked to impress others. One if not both was wholly\r\nphysical. He was very late in cutting his teeth, not a single one having\r\nappeared in the first twelvemonth, and the hardness of his infant gums\r\ncaused an old wife to prognosticate that he would be edentulous. Also,\r\nhis lungs were so vigorous and so habitually exercised that he was\r\npronounced \"the loudest and most indefatigable squaller of all the brats\r\nof Angus.\"\r\n\r\nThe geologist who so emphatically affirmed the necessity of travel,\r\nearly became an unconscious practiser of his own precept. When he was\r\nthree months old his parents went from Kinnordy to Inveraray, whence\r\nthey journeyed to the south of England, as far as Ilfracombe. From this\r\nplace they removed to Weymouth and thence to Southampton. More than a\r\nyear must have been thus spent, for their second child--also a son--was\r\nborn at the last-named town. Mr. Lyell, the father, now took a lease of\r\nBartley Lodge, on the New Forest--some half-dozen miles west of\r\nSouthampton, where the family lived for twenty-eight years. His mother\r\nand sisters also left Kinnordy, and rented a house in Southampton. Their\r\nfrequent excursions to Bartley Lodge, as Lyell observes, were always\r\nwelcome to the children, for they never came empty-handed.\r\n\r\nKinnordy, however, was visited from time to time in the summer, and on\r\none of these occasions, when Charles was in his fifth year, some of the\r\nfamily had a narrow escape. They were about a stage and a half from\r\nEdinburgh; the parents and the two boys in one carriage; two nursemaids,\r\nthe cook, and the two youngest children, sisters, in a chaise behind.\r\nThe horses of this took fright on a narrow part of the road and upset\r\nthe carriage over a very steep slope. Fortunately all escaped unhurt,\r\nexcept one of the maids, whose arm was cut by the splintered glass. The\r\nparents ran to the rescue. \"Meanwhile, Tom and I were left in the\r\ncarriage. We thought it fine pastime, and I am accused of having\r\nprompted Tom to assist in plundering the pockets of the carriage of all\r\nthe buns and other eatables, which we demolished with great speed for\r\nfear of interruption.\"[3] This adventure, however, was not quite his\r\nearliest reminiscence; for that was learning the alphabet when he was\r\nabout three years old.\r\n\r\nCharles was kept at home till he had nearly completed his eighth year,\r\nwhen he was sent with his brother Tom to a boarding-school at Ringwood.\r\nThe master was the Rev. R. S. Davies; the lads were some fifty in\r\nnumber, the Lyells being about the youngest. They seem, however, not to\r\nhave been ill-treated, though their companions were rather a rough lot,\r\nand they were petted by the schoolmaster's daughter. The most\r\nsensational incident of his stay at Ringwood was a miniature \"town and\r\ngown\" row, a set fight between the lads of the place and of the school,\r\nfrom which, however, the Lyells were excluded as too young to share in\r\nthe joys and the perils of war. But the fray was brought to a rather\r\npremature conclusion by the joint intervention of foreign powers--the\r\nmasters of the school and the tradesmen of the town. In those days\r\nsmuggling was rife on the south coast, and acting the part of revenue\r\nofficers and contrabandists was a favourite school game; doubtless the\r\nmore popular because it afforded a legitimate pretext for something like\r\na fight. The fear of a French invasion also kept this part of England on\r\nthe _qui vive_, and Lyell well remembered the excitement caused by a\r\nfalse alarm that the enemy had landed. He further recollected the\r\nmingled joy and sorrow which were caused by the victory of Trafalgar and\r\nthe death of Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe brothers remained at Ringwood only for about two years, for neither\r\nthe society nor the instruction could be called first-class; and they\r\nwere sent, after a rather long holiday at home, to another school of\r\nabout the same size, but much higher character, in Salisbury. The\r\nmaster, Dr. Radcliffe, an Oxford man, was a good classical scholar, and\r\nhis pupils came from the best families in that part of England. In one\r\nrespect, the young Lyells found it a change for the worse. At Ringwood\r\nthey had an ample playground, close to which was the Avon, gliding clear\r\nand cool to the sea, a delightful place for a bathe. In a few minutes'\r\nwalk from the town they were among pleasant lanes; in a short time they\r\ncould reach the border of the New Forest. But at Salisbury the school\r\nwas in the heart of the town, its playground a small yard surrounded by\r\nwalls, and, as he says, \"we only walked out twice or three times in a\r\nweek, when it did not rain, and were obliged to keep in ranks along the\r\nendless streets and dusty roads of the suburbs of a city. It seemed a\r\nkind of prison by comparison, especially to me, accustomed to liberty in\r\nsuch a wild place as the New Forest.\" One can sympathise with his\r\nfeelings, for a procession of schoolboys, walking two and two along the\r\nstreets of a town, is a dreary spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut an occasional holiday brought some comfort, for then they were sent\r\non a longer excursion. The favourite one was to the curious earthworks\r\nof Old Sarum, then in its glory as a \"rotten borough,\" one alehouse,\r\nwith its tea-gardens attached, sending two members to Parliament. On\r\nthese excursions more liberty seems to have been permitted. The boys\r\nbroke up the large flints that lay all about the ground, to find in them\r\ncavities lined with chalcedony or drusy crystals of quartz. But the\r\nchief interest centred around a mysterious excavation in the earthwork,\r\n\"a deep, long subterranean tunnel, said to have been used by the\r\ngarrison to get water from a river in the plain below.\" To this all\r\nnew-comers were taken to listen to the tale of its enormous depth and\r\nsubterranean pool. Then, when duly overawed, they felt their hats fly\r\noff their heads and saw them rolling out of sight down the tunnel. An\r\ninterval followed of blank dismay, embittered, no doubt, by dismal\r\nanticipations of what would probably happen when they got back to the\r\nschool-house. Then one of the older boys volunteered to act the sybil\r\nand lead the way to the nether world. Of course they \"regained their\r\nfelt and felt what they regained\"--literally, for the hole was dark\r\nenough, though we may set down the \"many hundred yards\" (which Lyell\r\nsays that he descended before he recovered his lost hat) as an instance\r\nof the permanent effect of a boyish illusion on even a scientific mind.\r\n\r\nBut the restrictions of Salisbury made the liberty of the New Forest yet\r\nmore dear. Bartley was an ideal home for boys. It was surrounded by\r\nmeadows and park-like timber. A two-mile walk brought the lads to Rufus\r\nStone, and on the wilder parts of the Forest. There they could ramble\r\nover undulating moors, covered with heath and fern, diversified by\r\nmarshy tracts, sweet with bog-myrtle, or by patches of furze, golden in\r\nseason with flowers; or they could wander beneath the shadows of its\r\ngreat woods of oak and beech, over the rustling leaves, among the\r\nflickering lights and shadows, winding here and there among tufts of\r\nholly scrub, always led on by the hope of some novelty--a rare insect\r\nfluttering by, a lizard or a snake gliding into the fern, strange birds\r\ncircling in the air, a pheasant or even a woodcock springing up almost\r\nunder the feet. The rabbits scampered to their holes among the furze; a\r\nfox now and again stole silently away to cover, or a stag--for the deer\r\nhad not yet been destroyed--was espied among the tall brake. Those, too,\r\nit must be remembered, were the days when boys got their holidays in the\r\nprime of the summer, at the season of haymaking and of ripe\r\nstrawberries. They were not kept stewing in hot school-rooms all through\r\nJuly, until the flowers are nearly over and the bright green of the\r\nfoliage is dulled, until the romance of the summer's youth has given\r\nplace to the dulness of its middle age. In these days it is our pleasure\r\nto do the right thing in the wrong place--a truly national\r\ncharacteristic. We all--young and old--toil through the heat and the\r\nlong days, and take holiday when the autumn is drawing nigh and Nature\r\nwrites \"Ichabod\" on the beauty of the waning year.\r\n\r\nAt Salisbury, Lyell had two new experiences--the sorrows of the Latin\r\nGrammar and the joys of a bolster-fight. But his health was not good; a\r\nsevere attack of measles in the first year was followed in the second by\r\na general \"breakdown,\" with symptoms of weakness of the lungs. So he was\r\ntaken home for three months to recruit. This was at first a welcome\r\nchange from the restrictions of Salisbury; but, as his lessons\r\nnecessarily were light, he began to mope for want of occupation; for, as\r\nhe says, \"I was always most exceedingly miserable if unemployed, though\r\nI had an excessive aversion to work unless forced to it.\" So he began to\r\ncollect insects--a pursuit which, as he remarks, exactly suited him, for\r\nit was rather desultory, gave employment to both mind and body, and\r\ngratified the \"collecting\" instinct, which is strong in most boys. He\r\nbegan with the lepidoptera, but before long took an interest in other\r\ninsects, especially the aquatic. Fortunately his father had been for a\r\ntime a collector, and possessed some good books on entomology, from the\r\npictures in which Charles named his captures. This was, of course, an\r\nunscientific method, but it taught him to recognise the species and to\r\nknow their habits. There are few better localities for lepidoptera, as\r\nevery collector knows, than the New Forest, and some of the schoolboy's\r\n\"finds\" afterwards proved welcome to so well known an entomologist as\r\nCurtis. But when Charles returned to school he had to lay aside, for a\r\nseason, the new hobby; for in those days a schoolboy's interest in\r\nnatural history did not extend beyond birds'-nesting, and his little\r\nworld was not less, perhaps even more frank and demonstrative than now,\r\nin its criticism of any innovation or peculiarity on the part of one of\r\nits members.\r\n\r\nThe school at Salisbury appears to have been a preparatory one, so\r\nbefore very long another had to be sought. Mr. Lyell wished to send his\r\ntwo boys to Winchester, but found to his disappointment that there would\r\nnot be a vacancy for a couple of years; so after instructing them at\r\nhome for six months, he contented himself with the Grammar School at\r\nMidhurst, in Sussex, at the head of which was one Dr. Bayley, formerly\r\nan under-master at Winchester. Charles, now in his thirteenth year,\r\nfound this, at first, a great change. The school contained about seventy\r\nboys, big as well as little, and its general system resembled that of\r\none of the great public schools. He remarks of this period of his life:\r\n\"Whatever some may say or sing of the happy recollections of their\r\nschooldays, I believe the generality, if they told the truth, would not\r\nlike to have them over again, or would consider them as less happy than\r\nthose which follow.\" He was not the kind of boy to find the life of a\r\npublic school very congenial. Evidently he was a quietly-disposed lad,\r\ncaring more for a country ramble than for games; perhaps a little\r\nold-fashioned in his ways; not pugnacious, but preferring a quiet life\r\nto the trouble of self-assertion. So, in his second half-year, when he\r\nwas left to shift entirely for himself, his life was \"not a happy one,\"\r\nfor a good deal of the primeval savage lingers in the boys of a\r\ncivilised race. It required, as he said, a good deal to work him up to\r\nthe point of defending his independence; thus he was deemed incapable of\r\nresistance and was plagued accordingly. But at last he turned upon a\r\ntormentor, and a fight was the result. It was of Homeric proportions,\r\nfor it lasted two days, during five or six hours on each, the combatants\r\nbeing pretty evenly matched; for though Lyell's adversary was rather the\r\nsmaller and weaker, he knew better how to use his fists. Strength at the\r\nend prevailed over science, though both parties were about equally\r\ndamaged. The vanquished pugilist was put to bed, being sorely bruised in\r\nthe visible parts. Lyell, whose hurts were mostly hidden, made light of\r\nthem, by the advice of friends, but he owns that he ached in every bone\r\nfor a week, and was black and blue all over his body. Still he had not\r\nfought in vain, for, though the combat won him little honour, it\r\ndelivered him from sundry tormentors.\r\n\r\nThe educational system of the school stimulated his ambition to rise in\r\nthe classes. \"By this feeling,\" he says, \"much of my natural antipathy\r\nto work, and extreme absence of mind, was conquered in a great measure,\r\nand I acquired habits of attention which, however, were very painful to\r\nme, and only sustained when I had an object in view.\" There was an\r\nannual speech-day, and Charles, on the first occasion, obtained a prize\r\nfor his performance. \"Every year afterwards,\" he continues, \"I received\r\ninvariably a prize for speaking, until high enough to carry off the\r\nprizes for Latin and English original composition. My inventive talents\r\nwere not quick, but to have any is so rare a qualification that it is\r\nsure to obtain a boy at our great schools (and afterwards as an author)\r\nsome distinction.\" Evidently he gave proofs of originality beyond his\r\nfellows; since he won a prize for English verse, though he had written\r\nin the metre of the \"Lady of the Lake\" instead of the ordinary\r\nten-syllabic rhyme. On another occasion he commemorated, in his weekly\r\nLatin copy, the destruction of the rats in a neighbouring pond, writing\r\nin mock heroics, after the style of Homer's battle of the frogs and\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nThe school, like all other collections of boys, had its epidemic\r\nhobbies. The game of draughts, coupled unfortunately with gambling on a\r\nsmall scale, was followed by chess, and that by music. To each of these\r\nCharles was more or less a victim, and his progress up the school was\r\nnot thereby accelerated. Birds'-nesting also had a turn in its season.\r\nHis love for natural history made him so keen in this pursuit that he\r\nbecame an expert climber of trees. But his schooldays on the whole were\r\nuneventful, and he went to Oxford at a rather early age, his brother Tom\r\nhaving already left Midhurst in order to enter the Navy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Born 1767, died 1849 (also son of a Charles Lyell); educated at St.\r\nAndrew's and at St. Peter's College, Cambridge, where he proceeded to\r\nthe degree of B.A. in 1791 and M.A. in 1794.\r\n\r\n[2] In 1835, the _Canzoniere_, including the _Vita Nuova and Convito_; a\r\nsecond edition was published in 1842; in 1845 a translation of the\r\nLyrical Poems of Dante.\r\n\r\n[3] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNDERGRADUATE DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLyell matriculated at Exeter College, and appears to have begun\r\nresidence in January, 1816--that is, soon after completing his\r\neighteenth year. At Oxford, though not a \"hard reader,\" he was evidently\r\nfar from idle, and wrote for some of the University prizes, though\r\nwithout success. Several of his letters to his father have been\r\npreserved. In these he talks about his studies, mathematical and\r\nclassical; criticises Coleridge's \"Christabel,\" and praises Kirke\r\nWhite's poetry; describes the fritillaries blossoming in the\r\nChristchurch meadows, and refers occasionally to political matters. The\r\nletters are well expressed, and indicate a thoughtful and observant\r\nmind. While yet a schoolboy he had stumbled upon a copy of Bakewell's\r\n\"Geology\" in his father's library, which had so far awakened his\r\ninterest that in the earlier part of his residence at Oxford he attended\r\na course of Professor Buckland's lectures, and took careful notes. The\r\nnew study is briefly mentioned in a letter, dated July 20th, 1817. This\r\nis written from Yarmouth, where he is visiting Mr. Dawson Turner, the\r\nwell-known antiquarian and botanist. He states that, on his way through\r\nLondon, he went to see the elephant at Exeter Change, Bullock's Museum,\r\nand Francillon's collection of insects. At Norwich also he saw more\r\ninsects, the cathedral, and some chalk pits, in which he found an\r\n\"immense number of belemnites, echinites, and bivalves.\" He was also\r\ngreatly interested by the fossils in Dr. Arnold's collection at\r\nYarmouth, particularly by the \"alcyonia\" found in flints.[4] A few days\r\nlater he again dwells on geology, and speculates shrewdly on the\r\nformation of the lowland around Yarmouth and the ancient course of the\r\nriver. In one paragraph a germ of the future \"Principles\" may be\r\ndetected. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n      \"Dr. Arnold and I examined yesterday the pit which is dug\r\n      out for the foundation of the Nelson monument, and found\r\n      that the first bed of shingle is eight feet down. Now this\r\n      was the last stratum brought by the sea; all since was\r\n      driven up by wind and kept there by the 'Rest-harrow' and\r\n      other plants. It is mere sand. Therefore, thirty-five years\r\n      ago the Deens were nearly as low as the last stratum left by\r\n      the sea; and as the wind would naturally have begun adding\r\n      from the very first, it is clear that within fifty years the\r\n      sea flowed over that part. This, even Mr. T. allows, is a\r\n      strong argument in favour of the recency of the changes. Dr.\r\n      Arnold surprised me by telling me that he thought that the\r\n      Straits of Dover were formerly joined, and that the great\r\n      current and tides of the North Sea being held back, the sea\r\n      flowed higher over these parts than now. If he had thought a\r\n      little more he would have found no necessity for all this,\r\n      for all those towns on this eastern coast, which have no\r\n      river god to stand their friend, have necessarily been\r\n      losing in the same proportion as Yarmouth gains--viz.\r\n      Cromer, Pakefield, Dunwich, Aldborough, etc., etc. With\r\n      Dunwich I believe it is _Fuit Ilium_.\"[5]\r\n\r\nEvidently Lyell by this time had become deeply interested in geology,\r\nfor his journal contains several notes made on the road from London to\r\nKinnordy, and records, during his stay there, not only the capture of\r\ninsects, but also visits to quarries, and the discovery of crystallised\r\nsulphate of barytes at Kirriemuir and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his first long vacation he travelled, in company with\r\ntwo friends of his own age, from Forfarshire across by Loch Tay,\r\nTyndrum, and Loch Awe, to the western coast at Oban, whence they visited\r\nStaffa and Iona. With the caves in the former island he was greatly\r\nimpressed; and he noted the columns of basalt, which, he said, were\r\n\"pentagonal\" in form, quite different from the \"four-square\" jointing of\r\nthe red granite at the south-west end of Mull. With the ruins of Iona he\r\nwas a little disappointed, for he wrote in his diary that \"they are but\r\npoor after all.\" The wonders of Fingal's Cave appealed to his poetical\r\nas well as to his geological instincts, for in October, after his return\r\nto Oxford, he sent to his father some stanzas on this subject which are\r\nnot without a certain merit. But the covering letter was mostly devoted\r\nto geology.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1818, marked an important step in his education as a\r\ngeologist, for he accompanied his father, mother, and two eldest sisters\r\non a Continental tour. Starting early in June, they drove in a\r\nramshackle carriage, which frequently broke down, from Calais to Paris,\r\nalong much the same route as the railway now takes; they visited the\r\nsights of the capital, not forgetting either the artistic treasures of\r\nthe Louvre or the collections of the Jardin des Plantes, particularly\r\nthe fossils of the \"Paris basin.\" Thence they journeyed by Fontainebleau\r\nand Auxerre to Dole, and he makes careful and shrewd notes on the\r\ngeology, for the carriage travelling of those days, though slow, was not\r\nwithout its advantages--and in crossing the Jura he observes the nodular\r\nflints in a limestone, and the contrast between these mountains and the\r\nGrampians of his native land. As they descended the well-known road\r\nwhich leads down to Gex in Switzerland, they had the good fortune to\r\nobtain a splendid view of Mont Blanc and the Alps. From Geneva, where he\r\nnotes the \"most peculiar deep blue colour of the Rhone,\" they visited\r\nChamouni by the usual route. At this time the principal glaciers were\r\nadvancing rather rapidly. The Glacier des Bossons, he remarks, \"has\r\ntrodden down the tallest pines with as much ease as an elephant could\r\nthe herbage of a meadow. Some trunks are still seen projecting from the\r\nrock of ice, all the heads being embodied in this mass, which shoots out\r\nat the top into tall pyramids and pinnacles of ice, of beautiful shapes\r\nand a very pure white.... It has been pressed on not only through the\r\nforest, but over some cultivated fields, which are utterly lost.\"[6]\r\n\r\nAt Chamouni, Lyell made the most of his time, for in three days he\r\nwalked up to the Col de Balme, climbed the Brevent, and made his first\r\nglacier expedition, to the well-known oasis among the great fields of\r\nsnow and ice which is called the Jardin. Everywhere he notes the\r\nflowers, which at that season were in full beauty; and the insects,\r\ncapturing \"no less than seven specimens of that rare insect, _Papilio\r\nApollo_.\"[7] He feels all the surprise and all the delight which thrills\r\nthe entomologist from the British Isles when he first sets foot on the\r\nslopes of the higher Alps, and sees in abundance the rarities of his own\r\ncountry, besides not a few new species. But Lyell does not neglect the\r\nrocks and minerals, or the red snow, or the wonders of the ice world.\r\nChamouni, we are told, was then \"perfectly inundated with English,\" for\r\nfifty arrived in one day. The previous year they had numbered one\r\nthousand out of a total of fourteen hundred visitors. Since then, times\r\nand the village have changed.\r\n\r\nReturning to Geneva, the party travelled by Lausanne and Neuchatel to\r\nBale, and then followed the picturesque route along the river, by the\r\ntumultuous rapids of Laufenburg and the grand falls of the Rhine, to\r\nSchaffhausen, whence they turned off to Zurich. Here he writes of the\r\nprincipal inn that it \"partook more than any of a fault too common in\r\nSwitzerland. They have their stables and cow-houses under the same roof,\r\nand the unavoidable consequences may be conceived, till they can fall in\r\nwith a man as able--as 'Hercules to cleanse a stable.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom Zurich they crossed the Albis to Zug. The other members of the\r\nparty went direct to Lucerne, but Lyell turned aside to visit the spot\r\nwhere twelve years previously an enormous mass of pudding-stone had come\r\ncrashing down from the Rossberg, had destroyed the village of Goldau,\r\nand had converted a great tract of fertile land into a wilderness of\r\nbroken rock. He diagnosed correctly the cause of the catastrophe, and\r\nthen ascended the Rigi. Here he spent a flea-bitten night at the Kulm\r\nHotel, but was rewarded by a fine sunset and a yet finer sunrise.\r\n\r\nAt Lucerne he rejoined his relatives, and they drove together over the\r\nBruenig Pass to Meyringen. From this place they made an excursion to the\r\nGiessbach Falls, and saw the Alpbach in flood after a downpour of rain.\r\nThis, like some other Alpine streams, becomes at such times a raging\r\nmass of liquid mud and shattered slate, and Lyell carefully notes the\r\naction of the torrent under these novel circumstances, and its increased\r\npower of transport. Parting from his relatives at the Handeck Falls, he\r\nwalked up the valley of the Aar to the Grimsel Hospice, where he passed\r\nthe night, and the next morning crossed over into the valley of the\r\nRhone to the foot of its glacier, and then walked back again to\r\nMeyringen. He remarks that on the way to the Hospice \"we passed some\r\nextraordinary large bare planks of granite rock above our track, the\r\nappearance of which I could not account for.\" This is not surprising,\r\nfor he had not yet learnt to read the \"handwriting on the wall\" of a\r\nvanished glacier. Its interpretation was not to come for another twenty\r\nyears, when these would be recognised as perhaps the finest examples of\r\nice-worn rocks in Switzerland. Lyell was evidently a good pedestrian;\r\nfor the very next day he walked from Meyringen over the two Scheideggs\r\nto Lauterbrunnen, ultimately joining his relatives at Thun, from which\r\ntown they went on to Berne, where they were so fortunate as to see, from\r\nthe well-known terrace, the snowy peaks of the Oberland in all the\r\nbeauty of the sunset glow.\r\n\r\nThen they journeyed over the pleasant uplands to Vevay, and so by the\r\nshore of the Lake of Geneva and the plain of the Rhone valley to\r\nMartigny, turning aside to visit the salt mines near Bex. They reached\r\nMartigny a little more than seven weeks after the lake, formed in the\r\nvalley of the Dranse by the forward movement of the Gietroz Glacier, had\r\nburst its icy barrier, and they saw everywhere the ruins left by the\r\nrush of the flood. The road as they approached Martigny was even then,\r\nin some places, under water; in others it was completely buried beneath\r\nsand. The lower storey of the hotel had been filled with mud and debris,\r\nwhich was still piled up to the courtyard. Lyell went up the valley of\r\nthe Dranse to the scene of the catastrophe, and wrote in his journal an\r\ninteresting description of both the effects of the flood and the\r\nremnants of the ice-barrier. Before returning to Martigny he also walked\r\nup to the Hospice on the Great St. Bernard, and then the whole party\r\ncrossed by the Simplon Pass into Italy, following the accustomed route\r\nand visiting the usual sights till they arrived at Milan.\r\n\r\nThe next stage on their tour--and this must have been in those days a\r\nlittle tedious--brought them to Venice. The Campanile Lyell does not\r\ngreatly admire, and of St. Mark's he says rather oddly, \"The form is\r\nvery cheerful and gay\"; but on the whole he is much impressed with the\r\nbuildings of Venice, and especially with the pictures. On their return\r\nthey went to Bologna, and then crossed the Apennines to Florence.\r\nEverywhere little touches in the diary indicate a mind exceptionally\r\nobservant--such as notes on the first firefly, the fields of millet, the\r\nfestooned vines seen on the plain, or the peculiar sandy zone on the\r\nnorthern slopes of the hills. He also mentions that shortly after\r\ncrossing the frontier of Tuscany they passed near Coviliajo, \"a volcanic\r\nfire\" which proceeded from a neighbouring mountain.[8] This they\r\nintended to visit on their return. But at Florence the diary ends\r\nabruptly, for the note-book which contained the rest of it was\r\nunfortunately lost.\r\n\r\nWe have given this summary of Lyell's journal in some detail, but even\r\nthus it barely suffices to convey an adequate idea of the cultured\r\ntastes, wide interests, and habits of close and accurate observation\r\ndisclosed by its pages. It shows, better perhaps than any other\r\ndocuments, the mental development of the future author of the\r\n\"Principles of Geology.\" Few things, as he journeys, escape his notice;\r\nhe describes facts carefully and speculates but little. As he wanders\r\namong the Alpine peaks, he makes no reference to convulsions of the\r\nearth's crust; as he views the ruin wrought by the Dranse, he says\r\nnaught of deluges.\r\n\r\nThe travellers got back to England in September, and at the end of the\r\nLong Vacation Lyell returned to Oxford. There he remained till December,\r\n1819, when he proceeded to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, obtaining a\r\nsecond class in Classical Honours. Considering that he had never been a\r\n\"hard reader,\" and that he appears to have spent much of his \"longs\" in\r\ntravel--a practice which, though good for general education, counts for\r\nlittle in the schools--the position indicates that he possessed rather\r\nexceptional abilities and a good amount of scholarship. Though Oxford\r\nhad been unable to bestow upon him a systematic training in science, she\r\nhad given a definite bias to his inclination, and had fostered and\r\ncultivated a taste for literature which in the future brought forth a\r\nrich fruitage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Probably they were fossil sponges.\r\n\r\n[5] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 43.\r\n\r\n[6] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 69.\r\n\r\n[7] Now generally called Parnassius Apollo; but very likely he captured\r\nmore than one species of the genus.\r\n\r\n[8] Probably it was a bituminous shale which had become ignited, as was\r\nthe case at Ringstead Bay, Dorset, with the Kimeridge clay. The same\r\noften happens with the \"banks\" of coal-pits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF A PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after he had donned the bachelor's hood Lyell came to London,\r\nwas entered at Lincoln's Inn, and studied law in the office of a special\r\npleader. Science was not forsaken, for in March, 1819, he was elected a\r\nFellow of the Geological Society, and about the same time joined the\r\nLinnean Society. Before very long his legal studies were interrupted.\r\nHis eyes became so weak that a complete rest was prescribed;\r\naccordingly, in the autumn of 1820, he accompanied his father on a\r\njourney to Rome. During this but little was done in geology, for the\r\ntravellers spent almost all their time in towns.\r\n\r\nOn his return, so far as can be inferred from the few letters which have\r\nbeen published, Lyell continued to work at geology, and at Christmas,\r\n1821, was seeking in vain for freshwater fossils in the neighbourhood of\r\nBartley. In the spring of 1822 he investigated the Sussex coast from\r\nHastings to Dungeness, and studied the effects of the sea at Winchelsea\r\nand Rye. In the early summer of 1823 he visited the Isle of Wight, and\r\nin a letter to Dr. Mantell suggested that the \"blue marl\"[9] in Compton\r\nChine is identical with that at Folkestone, and compared the underlying\r\nstrata with those in Sussex, clearing up some confusions, into which\r\nearlier observers had fallen, about the Wealden and Lower Greensand. He\r\nwas now evidently beginning to get a firm grip on the subject--a thing\r\nfar from easy in days when so little had been ascertained--and this year\r\nhe read his first papers to the Geological Society--one, in January,\r\nwritten in conjunction with Dr. Mantell, \"On the Limestone and Clay of\r\nthe Ironsand in Sussex\"; the other in June, \"On the Sections presented\r\nby Some Forfarshire Rivers.\" Also, on February 7th, he was elected one\r\nof the secretaries of that Society, an office which he retained till\r\n1826. This is a pretty clear proof that he had begun to make his mark\r\namong geologists, and was well esteemed by the leaders of the science.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he returned from the Isle of Wight than he started for\r\nParis, going direct from London to Calais, in the _Earl of Liverpool_\r\nsteam packet, \"in 11 hours! 120 miles! engines 80 horse-power for 240\r\ntons.\" In the last letter written to his father before quitting England\r\nhe refers to our neighbours across the Channel in the following terms:\r\n\"My opinion of the French people is that they are much too corrupt for a\r\nfree government and much too enlightened for a despotic one.\" That was\r\nwritten full seventy years ago; perhaps even now, were he alive, he\r\nwould not be disposed to withdraw the words.\r\n\r\nAt Paris he was well received by Cuvier, Humboldt, and other men of\r\nscience, attended lectures at the Jardin du Roi, and saw a good deal of\r\nsociety. His letters home often contain interesting references to\r\nmatters political and social--such as, for example, the following\r\nremarks which he heard from the mouth of Humboldt: \"You cannot conceive\r\nhow striking and ludicrous a feature it is in Parisian society at\r\npresent that every other man one meets is either minister or\r\nex-minister. So frequent have been the changes. The instant a new\r\nministry is formed, a body of sappers and miners is organised. They work\r\nindustriously night and day. At last the ministers find that they are\r\nsupplanted by the very arts by which a few months ago they raised\r\nthemselves to power.\"[10] Lyell more than once expresses a regret,\r\nwhich, indeed, was generally felt in scientific circles, that Cuvier had\r\nlost caste by \"dabbling so much with the dirty pool of politics\"; and\r\nhimself works away at geology, studying the fossils of the Paris basin\r\nin the museums, and visiting the most noted sections in order to add to\r\nhis own collection and observe the relations of the strata.\r\n\r\nHe returned to England towards the end of September, and no doubt spent\r\nthe next few months in working at geology as far as his eyes, which were\r\nbecoming stronger, permitted. The summer of 1824 was devoted to\r\ngeological expeditions. In the earlier part he took Mons. Constant\r\nPrevost, one of the leaders of geology in France, to the west of\r\nEngland. Their special purpose was to examine the Jurassic rocks, but\r\nthey extended their tour as far as Cornwall. Afterwards Lyell went to\r\nScotland, where he was joined by Professor Buckland; and the two\r\nfriends, after spending a few days in Ross-shire, went to Brora, and\r\nthen returned from Inverness by the Caledonian canal. This gave them the\r\nopportunity of examining the famous \"parallel roads\" of Glenroy, which\r\nwere the more interesting because they had already seen something of\r\nthe kind near Cowl, in Ross-shire. Afterwards they went up Glen Spean\r\nand crossed the mountains to Blair Athol, visiting the noted locality in\r\nGlen Tilt, where Hutton made his famous discovery of veins of granite\r\nintrusive in the schists of that valley, and then they made their way to\r\nEdinburgh. Here much work was done, both among collections and in the\r\nfield, and it was lightened--as might be expected in a place so\r\nhospitable--by social pleasures and friendly converse with some of the\r\nleading literary and scientific men.\r\n\r\nFour years of comparative rest and frequent change of scene had produced\r\nsuch an improvement in the condition of his eyes that he was able to\r\nresume his study of the law, and was called to the Bar in 1825. For two\r\nyears he went on the Western Circuit, having chambers in the Temple and\r\ngetting a little business. But, as his correspondence shows, geology\r\nstill held the first place in his affections,[11] and papers were read\r\nto the Society from time to time. Among them one of the most important,\r\nthough it was not printed in their journal, described a dyke of\r\nserpentine which cut through the Old Red Sandstone on the Kinnordy\r\nestate.[12] But, as is shown by a letter to his sister, written in the\r\nmonth of November, he had not lost his interest in entomology. At that\r\ntime the collectors of insects in Scotland were very few in number, and\r\nthe English lepidopterists welcomed the specimens which Lyell and his\r\nsister had caught in Forfarshire. The family had left Bartley Lodge in\r\nthe earlier part of the year and had settled in the old home at\r\nKinnordy. About this time also Lyell began to contribute to the\r\n_Quarterly Review_, writing articles on educational and scientific\r\ntopics. This led to a friendship with Lockhart, who became editor at the\r\nend of 1825, and gave him an introduction to Sir Walter Scott. A\r\nChristmas visit to Cambridge introduced him to the social life of that\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1827 his ideas as to his future work appear to have\r\nbegun to assume a definite form. To Dr. Mantell[13] he writes that he\r\nhas been reading Lamarck, and is not convinced by that author's theories\r\nof the development of species, \"which would prove that men may have come\r\nfrom the ourang-outang,\" though he makes this admission: \"After all,\r\nwhat changes a species may really undergo! How impossible will it be to\r\ndistinguish and lay down a line, beyond which some of the so-called\r\nextinct species have never passed into recent ones!\" The next sentence\r\nis significant: \"That the earth is quite as old as he [Lamarck] supposes\r\nhas long been my creed, and I will try before six months are over to\r\nconvert the readers of the _Quarterly_ to that heterodox opinion.\"[14] A\r\nfew lines further on come some sentences which indicate that the\r\nleading idea of the \"Principles\" was even then floating in his mind. \"I\r\nam going to write in confirmation of ancient causes having been the same\r\nas modern, and to show that those plants and animals, which we know are\r\nbecoming preserved now, are the same as were formerly.\" Hence, he\r\nproceeds to argue, it is not safe to infer that because the remains of\r\ncertain classes of plants or animals are not found in particular strata,\r\nthe creatures themselves did not then exist. \"You see the drift of my\r\nargument,\" he continues; \"_ergo_, mammalia existed when the oolite and\r\ncoal, etc., were formed.\"[15] The first of these quotations strikes the\r\nkeynote of modern geology as opposed to the older notions of the\r\nscience; what follows suggests a caution, to which Darwin afterwards\r\ndrew more particular attention, though he turned the weapon against\r\nLyell himself, viz. \"the imperfection of the geological record.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to his father, also written in the month of April, shows that,\r\nwhile he has an immediate purpose of opening fire on MacCulloch,[16] who\r\nhad bitterly attacked in the _Westminster Review_ Scrope's book upon\r\nVolcanoes, he has \"come to the conclusion that something of a more\r\nscientific character is wanted, for which the pages of a periodical are\r\nnot fitted.\" He might, he says, write an elementary book, like Mrs.\r\nMarcet's \"Conversations on Chemistry,\" but something on a much larger\r\nscale evidently is floating on his mind. In this letter also he\r\ndiscusses his prospects with his father, who apparently had suggested\r\nthat he should cease from going on circuit; and argues that he gains\r\ntime by appearing to be engaged in a profession, for \"friends have no\r\nmercy on the man who is supposed to have some leisure time, and heap\r\nupon him all kinds of unremunerative duties.\" Lyell was not devoid of\r\nScotch shrewdness, and doubtless early learnt that when it is all work\r\nand no pay men see your merits through a magnifying glass, but when it\r\ncomes to the question of a reward, they shift the instrument to your\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nGradually the plan of the future book assumed a more definite shape in\r\nhis mind, as we can see from a letter to Dr. Mantell early in 1828.\r\nAbout this time also Murchison, with whom he was planning a long visit\r\nto Auvergne,[17] appears among his correspondents. Herschel[18] tells\r\nhim how he and Faraday had melted in a furnace \"granite into a slag-like\r\nlava\"; Hooker[19] begs him to notice the connection between plants and\r\nsoils as he travels; his father urges him to take his clerk with him to\r\nact as amanuensis and save his eyes, which might be affected by the\r\nglare of the sun, and to help him generally in collecting specimens and\r\ncarrying the barometers. Early in the month of May he started for Paris,\r\nwhere he met Mr. and Mrs. Murchison, and the party left for Clermont\r\nFerrand in a \"light open carriage, with post horses.\" As far as Moulins\r\nthe roads were bad, but as they receded from Paris and approached the\r\nmountains \"the roads and the rates of posting improved, so that we\r\naveraged nine miles an hour, and the change of horses [was] almost as\r\nquick as in England. The politeness of the people has much delighted us,\r\nand they are so intelligent that we get much geology from them.\"\r\nClermont Ferrand became their headquarters for some time, and Lyell's\r\nletters to his father are full of notes on the geology of the district,\r\none of the most interesting in Europe. The great plateau which rises on\r\nthe western side of the broad valley of the Allier is studded with cones\r\nand craters--some so fresh that one might imagine their last eruptions\r\nto have happened during the decline of the Roman empire;[20] others in\r\nalmost every stage of dissection by the scalpels of nature. Streams of\r\nlava, still rough and clinkery, have poured themselves over the plateau\r\nand have run down the valleys till they have reached the plain of the\r\nAllier, while huge fragments of flows far larger and more ancient have\r\nbeen carved by the action of rain and rivers into natural bastions, and\r\nnow may be seen resting upon stratified marls, crowded with freshwater\r\nshells and other organisms,--the remnants of deposits accumulated in\r\ngreat lakes, which had been already drained in ages long before man\r\nappeared on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe two geologists worked hard, for who could be idle in such a country\r\nas this? They often began at six in the morning and rested not till\r\nevening, though the summers are hot in Auvergne, and this one was\r\nexceptionally so. Lyell writes home, \"I never did so much real geology\r\nin so many days.\" Mrs. Murchison also was \"very diligent, sketching,\r\nlabelling specimens, and making out shells, in which last she is a\r\nvaluable assistant.\" Sometimes they went farther afield, visiting\r\nPontgibaud and the gorge of the Sioul, where they found a section\r\npreviously unnoticed, which gave them a clear proof that a lava-stream\r\nhad dammed up the course of a river by flowing down into its valley, and\r\nhad converted the part above into a lake. This again had been drained as\r\nthe river had carved for itself a new channel, partly in the basalt,\r\npartly in the underlying gneiss. Here, then, was a clear proof that a\r\nriver could cut out a path for itself, and that forces still in\r\noperation were sufficient, given time enough, to sculpture the features\r\nof the earth's crust. Notwithstanding the hard work, the outdoor life\r\nsuited Lyell, who writes that his \"eyes were never in such condition\r\nbefore.\" Murchison, too, was generally in good health, but would have\r\nbeen better, according to his companion, if he had been a little more\r\nabstemious at table and a worse customer to the druggist.\r\n\r\nFrom Clermont Ferrand the travellers moved on to the Cantal, where they\r\ninvestigated the lacustrine deposits beneath the lava-streams all around\r\nAurillac. These deposits exhibited on a grand scale the phenomena which\r\nLyell had already observed on a small one in the marls of the loch at\r\nKinnordy. Thence they went on through the Ardeche and examined the \"pet\r\nvolcanoes of the Vivarais,\" as they had been termed by Scrope. The\r\nMurchisons now began to suffer from the heat, for it was the middle of\r\nJuly. Nevertheless, they still pushed on southwards, and after visiting\r\nthe old towns of Gard and the Bouches du Rhone, went along the Riviera\r\nto Nice, having been delayed for a time at Frejus, where Murchison had a\r\nsharp attack of malarious fever. It was an exceptionally dry summer, and\r\nthe town in consequence was malodorous; so after a short halt, they\r\nmoved on to Milan and at last arrived at Padua, working at geology as\r\nthey went along, and constantly accumulating new facts. From Padua they\r\nvisited Monte Bolca, noted for its fossil fish, the Vicentin, with its\r\nsheets of basalt, and the Euganean Hills, where the \"volcanic phenomena\r\n[were] just Auvergne over again.\" Then the travellers parted, the\r\nMurchisons turning northward to the Tyrol, while Lyell continued on his\r\njourney southward to Naples and Sicily.\r\n\r\nSome four months had now been spent, almost without interruption, in\r\nhard work and the daily questioning of Nature. The results had surpassed\r\neven Lyell's anticipations; they had thrown light upon the geological\r\nphenomena of the remote past, and cleared up many difficulties which,\r\nhitherto, had impeded the path of the investigators. On the coast of the\r\nMaritime Alps Lyell had found huge beds of conglomerate, parted one from\r\nanother by laminated shales full of fossils, most of which were\r\nidentical with creatures still living in the Mediterranean. These masses\r\nattained a thickness of 800 feet, and were displayed in the sides of a\r\nvalley fifteen miles in length. They supplied a case parallel with that\r\nof the conglomerates and sandstones of Angus, and indicated that no\r\nextraordinary conditions--no deluges or earth shatterings--had been\r\nneeded in order to form them. If the torrents from the Maritime Alps, as\r\nthey plunged into the Mediterranean, could build up these masses of\r\nstratified pebbles, why not appeal to the same agency in Scotland,\r\nthough the mountains from which they flowed, and the sheet of water into\r\nwhich they plunged, have alike vanished? The great flows of basalt--some\r\nfresh and intact, some only giant fragments of yet vaster masses--the\r\nbroken cones of scoria, and the rounded hills of trachyte in Auvergne,\r\nhad supplied him with links between existing volcanoes and the huge\r\nmasses of trap with which Scotland had made him familiar; while these\r\nbasalt flows--modern in a geological sense, but carved and furrowed by\r\nthe streams which still were flowing in their gorges--showed that rain\r\nand rivers were most potent, if not exclusive, agents in the excavation\r\nof valleys. \"The whole tour,\" thus he wrote to his father, \"has been\r\nrich, as I had anticipated (and in a manner which Murchison had not), in\r\nthose analogies between existing nature and the effects of causes in\r\nremote eras which it will be the great object of my work to point out. I\r\nscarcely despair now, so much do these evidences of modern action\r\nincrease upon us as we go south (towards the more recent volcanic seat\r\nof action) of _proving_ the positive identity of the causes now\r\noperating with those of former times.\"[21]\r\n\r\nOne important result of this journey was a conjoint paper on the\r\nexcavation of valleys in Auvergne, which was written before the friends\r\nparted, and was read at the Geological Society in the later part of the\r\nyear. Lyell writes thus to one of his sisters from Rome, on his return\r\nthither, in the following January[22]:--\r\n\r\n\"My letters from geological friends are very satisfactory as to the\r\nunusual interest excited in the Geological Society by our paper on the\r\nexcavation of valleys in Auvergne. Seventy persons present the second\r\nevening, and a warm debate. Buckland and Greenough furious, _contra_\r\nScrope, Sedgwick, and Warburton supporting us. These were the first two\r\nnights in our new _magnificent_ apartments at Somerset House.\" He adds,\r\n\"Longman has paid down 500 _guineas_ to Mr. Ure, of Dublin, for a\r\npopular work on geology, just coming out. It is to prove the Hebrew\r\ncosmogony, and that we ought all to be burnt in Smithfield.\"\r\n\r\nOn the way to Naples, Lyell made several halts: at Parma, Bologna,\r\nFlorence, Siena, Viterbo, and Rome; visiting local geologists, studying\r\ntheir collections of fossil shells, keeping his eye more especially on\r\nthe relations which the species exhibited with the fauna still existing\r\nin the Mediterranean, and losing no opportunity of examining the ancient\r\nvolcanic vents and the crater lakes, which form in places such\r\nremarkable features in the landscape. \"The shells in the travertine,\" he\r\nwrites, \"are all real species living in Italy, so you perceive that the\r\nvolcanoes had thrown out their ash, pumice, etc., and these had become\r\ncovered with lakes, and then the valleys had been hollowed out, all\r\nbefore Rome was built, 2,500 years and more ago.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching Naples, he climbed Vesuvius, and saw for the first time the\r\nlava-streams and piles of scoria of a volcano still active; while the\r\nwonderful sections of the old crater of Somma furnished a link between\r\nthe living present and the remote past--between Italy and Auvergne. He\r\nvisited Ischia, where another delightful surprise awaited him, for on\r\nits old volcano, Monte Epomeo, he found, at a height of 2,000 feet above\r\nthe sea, marine shells which belonged \"to the same class as those in the\r\nlower regions of Ischia.\" They were contained in a mass of clay, and\r\nwere quite unaltered. This was a great discovery, for the existence of\r\nthese fossils \"had not been dreamt of,\" and it showed that the land had\r\nbeen elevated to this extent without any appreciable change in the fauna\r\ninhabiting the Mediterranean. Except for this, the island was \"an\r\nadmirable illustration of Mont Dore.\" He made an excursion also to the\r\nTemples of Paestum, wonderful from the weird beauty of their ruins, on\r\nthe flat plain between the Apennines and the sea, but with interest\r\ngeological as well as archaeological, because of the blocks of rough\r\ntravertine with which their columns are built. These he studied, and he\r\nvisited the quarries from which they were hewn. His letters frequently\r\ncontain interesting references to the tyranny of the Government, \"the\r\ninquisitorial suppression of all cultivation of science, whether moral\r\nor physical,\" the idle, happy-go-lucky habits of the common people, the\r\nprevalent mendicancy, universal dishonesty, and general corruption. One\r\ninstance may be worth quoting--it indicates the material with which\r\n\"United Italy \" has had to deal. He wanted to pre-pay the postage of a\r\nletter to England. The head waiter at his hotel had said to him, \"'Mind,\r\nif it is to England you only pay fifteen grains' (sous). I thought the\r\nhint a trait of character, as they are all suspicious of one another.\r\nThe clerk demanded twenty-five. I remonstrated, but he insisted, and, as\r\nhe was dressed and had the manners of a gentleman, I paid. When I found\r\non my return that I had been cozened, I asked the head waiter, with some\r\nindignation, 'Is it possible that the Government officers are all\r\nknaves?' 'Sono Napolitani, Signor; la sua eccellenza mi scusera, ma io\r\nsono Romano!'\"[23] The old proverb, what is bred in the bone will out in\r\nthe flesh, still holds good; but we may doubt whether the standard of\r\nvirtue is quite so high as the speaker intimated in certain other\r\nprovinces which Piedmont has acquired at the price of the cradle of the\r\nroyal house and some of the best blood of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt Naples, Lyell was detained longer than he had expected, waiting for a\r\nGovernment steamer. \"There was,\" he says, \"no other way of going, for\r\nthe pirates of Tripoli have taken so many Neapolitan vessels that no one\r\nwho has not a fancy to see Africa will venture.\" But he arrived in\r\nSicily before the end of November, and succeeded in reaching the summit\r\nof Etna on the first of December. He was only just in time, for the next\r\nday bad weather set in, snow fell heavily, and the summit of the\r\nmountain became practically inaccessible for the winter. But as it was,\r\nhe was able to examine carefully another active volcano, the phenomena\r\nof which corresponded with those of Vesuvius, though on a grander scale.\r\nFrom Nicolosi, where he was delayed a day or two by the weather, Lyell\r\nwent along the Catanian plain to Syracuse and southward to the extreme\r\npoint of the island, Cape Passaro. From this headland he followed the\r\ncoast westward as far as Girgenti, and then struck across the island in\r\nan easterly direction till he came within about a day's journey of\r\nCatania, and then he turned off in a north-westerly direction through\r\nthe island to Palermo. In this zigzag journey, which occupied about five\r\nweeks, he succeeded in obtaining a good general knowledge of the geology\r\nof the eastern part of the island; he examined many sections and\r\ncollected many fossils, thus obtaining material for an accurate\r\nclassification of the little-known deposits of the Sicilian lowland, and\r\nin addition he lost no opportunity of studying the relations of the\r\nvolcanic masses, wherever they occurred, to the sedimentary strata. As\r\nhis letters show, bad roads, poor fare, and miserable accommodation made\r\nthe journey anything but one of pleasure; but its results, as he wrote\r\nto Murchison, \"exceeded his warmest expectations in the way of modern\r\nanalogies.\"\r\n\r\nBy December 10th he was once more back in the Bay of Naples. As he\r\nreturned through Rome he availed himself of the opportunity of examining\r\nthe travertines of Tivoli, which, as he remarked, presented more\r\nanalogies with those of Sicily than of Auvergne, and welcomed the news\r\nthat the bones of an elephant had been found in an alluvial deposit\r\nwhich lay beneath the lava of an extinct Tuscan volcano. His notes also\r\nprove that he was beginning to see his way to the classification of the\r\nextensive deposits of sand and marl in Italy and Sicily, which were\r\nsubsequently recognised as belonging to the Pliocene era.\r\n\r\nEarly in February Lyell reached Geneva on his homeward journey, after\r\ncrossing the Mont Cenis, and by the 19th was back in Paris among his\r\ngeological friends, \"pumping them,\" as he says, and being well pumped in\r\nreturn. Some of them, he finds, \"have come by most opposite routes to\r\nthe same conclusions as myself, and we have felt mutually confirmed in\r\nour views, although the new opinions must bring about an amazing\r\noverthrow in the systems which we were carefully taught ten years ago.\"\r\nThe accurate knowledge of Deshayes, one of the most eminent\r\nconchologists of that day, was especially helpful in bringing his field\r\nwork in Italy and Sicily into clear and definite order, and he obtained\r\nfrom him a promise of tables of more than 2,000 species of Tertiary\r\nshells, from which (he writes to his sister Caroline, who shared his\r\nentomological tastes) \"I will build up a system on data never before\r\nobtained, by comparing the contents of the present with more ancient\r\nseas, and the latter with each other.\"[24]\r\n\r\nBy the end of February he is back in London and at the Geological\r\nSociety, defending his views on the constancy of Nature's\r\noperations--views which seemed rank heresy to the older school, who\r\nsought to solve every difficulty by a convulsion, and were fettered in\r\ntheir interpretation of the records of geology by supposed theological\r\nnecessities. In April Lyell writes thus to Dr. Mantel[25]:--\r\n\r\n      \"A splendid meeting [at the Geological Society] last night,\r\n      Sedgwick in the chair. Conybeare's paper on Valley of the\r\n      Thames, directed against Messrs. Lyell and Murchison's\r\n      former paper, was read in part. Buckland present to defend\r\n      the 'Diluvialists,' as Conybeare styles his sect; and us he\r\n      terms 'Fluvialists.' Greenough assisted us by making an\r\n      ultra speech on the importance of modern causes....\r\n      Murchison and I fought stoutly, and Buckland was very piano.\r\n      Conybeare's memoir is not strong by any means. He admits\r\n      three deluges before the Noachian! and Buckland adds God\r\n      knows how many _catastrophes_ besides; so we have driven\r\n      them out of the Mosaic record fairly.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the month of June, he writes to the same correspondent in\r\nregard to the second portion of the same paper[26]:--\r\n\r\n      \"The last discharge of Conybeare's artillery, served by the\r\n      great Oxford engineer against the Fluvialists, as they are\r\n      pleased to term us, drew upon them on Friday a sharp volley\r\n      of musketry from all sides, and such a broadside, at the\r\n      finale, from Sedgwick as was enough to sink the 'Reliquiae\r\n      Diluvianae'[27] for ever, and make the second volume shy of\r\n      venturing out to sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn a third letter, written to Dr. Fleming, he gives a similar account of\r\nthe battle between the Diluvialists and Fluvialists, and concludes with\r\nthese words[28]:--\r\n\r\n      \"I am preparing a general work on the younger epochs of the\r\n      earth's history, which I hope to be out with next spring. I\r\n      begin with Sicily, which has almost entirely risen from the\r\n      sea, to the height of nearly 4,000 feet, since all the\r\n      present animals existed in the Mediterranean!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Now recognised as gault. The identification named above was soon\r\nfound to be correct.\r\n\r\n[10] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 127. Some sentences (for\r\nthe sake of brevity) are omitted from the quotation.\r\n\r\n[11] He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1826.\r\n\r\n[12] It appeared in the _Edin. Journ. Sci._, iii. (1825) p. 112, being\r\nhis first actual publication. Its importance consisted in proving that\r\nserpentine was, or rather had been, an igneous rock. If proper attention\r\nhad been paid to it, fewer mistaken statements and hypotheses would have\r\nattained the dignity of appearing in print.\r\n\r\n[13] Dr. Gideon A. Mantell, a surgeon by profession, at that time\r\nresident in Lewes, who made valuable contributions to the geology of\r\nSouth-East England, and was also distinguished for his popular lectures\r\nand books. He died in 1852.\r\n\r\n[14] Probably referring to an article on Scrope's \"Geology of Central\r\nFrance,\" in which he shows that he fully accepted the Huttonian doctrine\r\nof interpreting the geology of past ages by reference to the causes\r\nstill at work. It appeared in the _Quarterly Review_, Oct. 1827, vol.\r\nxxxvi. p. 437.\r\n\r\n[15] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 169.\r\n\r\n[16] Dr. John MacCulloch, author (among other works) of the \"Highlands\r\nand Western Isles of Scotland.\" He was an excellent geologist on the\r\nmineralogical side, but had little sympathy with palaeontology or with\r\nthe views to which Lyell inclined. He died in 1835.\r\n\r\n[17] This district had been already explored by Mr. G. P. Scrope, the\r\nfirst edition of whose classic work, \"The Volcanoes of Central France,\"\r\nwas published in 1826.\r\n\r\n[18] Sir John F. W. Herschel, the second of the illustrious astronomers\r\nof that name.\r\n\r\n[19] Sir W. J.

This, however,\r\nis disputed by many authorities.

Murchison, however, was again travelling on\r\nthe Continent, and, in company with Sedgwick, was exploring the\r\ngeological structure of the Eastern Alps and the basin of the Danube.\r\nThey appear to have kept up communication with Lyell, who hears with\r\nsatisfaction of the results of their work, since these cannot fail to\r\nkeep Murchison sound in the Uniformitarian faith and to complete the\r\nconversion of Sedgwick.[29]\r\n\r\n      \"The latter\" (Lyell writes to Dr. Fleming) \"was astonished\r\n      at finding what I had satisfied myself of everywhere, that\r\n      in the more recent tertiary groups great masses of rock,\r\n      like the different members of our secondaries, are to be\r\n      found. They call the grand formation in which they have been\r\n      working sub-Apennine. Vienna falls into it. I suspect it is\r\n      a shade older, as the sub-Apennines are several shades older\r\n      than the Sicilian tertiaries. They have discovered an\r\n      immensely thick conglomerate, 500 feet of compact\r\n      marble-like limestone, a great thickness of oolite, not\r\n      distinguishable from Bath oolite, an upper red sand and\r\n      conglomerate, etc. etc., all members of that group\r\n      zoologically sub-Apennine. This is glorious news for me....\r\n      It chimes in well with making old red transition mountain\r\n      limestone and coal, and as much more as we can, _one epoch_,\r\n      for when Nature sets about building in one place, she makes\r\n      a great batch there.... All the freshwater, marine, and\r\n      other groups of the Paris basin are one epoch, at the\r\n      farthest not more separated than the upper and lower chalk.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to the same correspondent, written nearly three weeks later, at\r\nthe end of October, and after his return to London, refers to the\r\nconsequences of this journey.[30]\r\n\r\n      \"Sedgwick and Murchison are just returned, the former full\r\n      of magnificent views. Throws overboard all the diluvian\r\n      hypothesis; is vexed he ever lost time about such a complete\r\n      humbug; says he lost two years by having also started a\r\n      Wernerian. He says primary rocks are not primary, but, as\r\n      Hutton supposed, some igneous, some altered secondary. Mica\r\n      schist in Alps lies _over_ organic remains. No rock in the\r\n      Alps older than lias.[31] Much of Buckland's dashing paper\r\n      on Alps wrong. A formation (marine) found at foot of Alps,\r\n      between Danube and Rhine, thicker than all the English\r\n      secondaries united. Munich is in it. Its age probably\r\n      between chalk and our oldest tertiaries. I have this moment\r\n      received a note from C. Prevost by Murchison. He has heard\r\n      with delight and surprise of their Alpine novelties, and,\r\n      alluding to them and other discoveries, he says: 'Comme nous\r\n      allons rire de nos vieilles idees! Comme nous allons nous\r\n      moquer de nous-memes!' At the same time he says: 'If in your\r\n      book you are too hard on us on this side the Channel, we\r\n      will throw at you some of old Brongniart's \"metric and\r\n      peponary blocks\" which float in that general and universal\r\n      diluvium, and have been there \"depuis le grand jour qui a\r\n      separe, d'une maniere si tranchee, les temps ante-des-temps\r\n      Post-Diluviens.\"'\"\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards, in a letter addressed to Mr. Leonard Horner,\r\nLyell declines to become a candidate for the Professorship of Geology\r\nand Mineralogy at the London University,[32] which was first opened in\r\nthe autumn of the previous year. Evidently he considers himself to be\r\ntoo fully occupied, for he writes to Dr. Mantell on December 5th that\r\nhis book has taken a definite shape.[33] \"I am bound hand and foot. In\r\nthe press on Monday next with my work, which Murray is going to\r\npublish--2 vols.--the title, 'Principles of Geology: being an Attempt to\r\nExplain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface by Reference to Causes\r\nnow in Operation.' The first volume will be quite finished by the end of\r\nthe month. The second is, in a manner, written, but will require great\r\nrecasting. I start for Iceland by the end of April, so time is\r\nprecious.\" The process of incubation was continued throughout the\r\nwinter. On February 3rd, 1830, he had corrected the press as far as the\r\neightieth page, getting on slowly, but with satisfaction to himself.\r\n\"How much more difficult it is,\" he remarks, \"to write for general\r\nreaders than for the scientific world; yet half our _savants_ think that\r\nto write _popularly_ would be a condescension to which they might bend\r\nif they would.\" He fully expects that the publication of his book will\r\nbring a hornet's nest about his head, but he has determined that, when\r\nthe first volume is attacked, he will waste no money on pamphleteering,\r\nbut will work on steadily at the second volume, and then, if the book\r\nis a success, at the second edition, for \"controversy is interminable\r\nwork.\" He felt now that the facts of nature were on his side, and his\r\nconclusions right in the main; so, like most strong men, he adopted the\r\nsame course as did the founder of Marischal College, Aberdeen, and wrote\r\nover the door of his study, \"Lat them say.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of a summer tour in Iceland fell through; so did another for a\r\nlong journey from St. Petersburg by Moscow to the Sea of Azof, to be\r\nfollowed by an examination of the Crimea and the Great Steppe, and a\r\nreturn up the Danube to Vienna; but by the middle of June the first\r\nvolume of the \"Principles\" was nearly finished; and in a letter to\r\nScrope,[34] to whom advance sheets of the book had been forwarded, in\r\norder that he might review it in the _Quarterly_, Lyell explains\r\nconcisely the position which he has taken in regard to cosmology and the\r\nearth's history.\r\n\r\n      \"Probably there was a beginning--it is a metaphysical\r\n      question, worthy a theologian--probably there will be an\r\n      end. Species, as you say, have begun and ended--but the\r\n      analogy is faint and distant. Perhaps it is an analogy, but\r\n      all I say is, there are, as Hutton said, 'no signs of a\r\n      beginning, no prospect of an end.' Herschel thought the\r\n      nebulae became worlds. Davy said in his last book, 'It is\r\n      always more probable that the new stars become visible, and\r\n      then invisible, and pre-existed, than that they are created\r\n      and extinguished.' So I think. All I ask is, that at any\r\n      given period of the past, don't stop inquiry when puzzled by\r\n      refuge to a beginning, which is all one with 'another state\r\n      of nature,' as it appears to me. But there is no harm in\r\n      your attacking me, provided you point out that it is the\r\n      proof I deny, not the probability of a beginning. Mark, too,\r\n      my argument, that we are called upon to say in each case,\r\n      'Which is now most probable, my ignorance of all possible\r\n      effects of existing causes,' or that 'the beginning' is the\r\n      cause of this puzzling phenomenon?\"\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the letter he refers to his theory of the dependence\r\nof the climate of a region upon the geography, not only upon its\r\nlatitude, but also upon the distribution of land and sea, and that of\r\nthe coincidence of time between zoological and geographical changes in\r\nthe past, as the most novel parts of the book; stating also that he has\r\nbeen careful to refer to all authors from whom he has borrowed, and that\r\nto Scrope himself he is under more obligation, so far as he knows, than\r\nto any other geologist. The concluding words also are interesting:--\r\n\r\n      \"I conceived the idea five or six years ago, that if ever\r\n      the Mosaic geology could be set down without giving offence,\r\n      it would be in an historical sketch, and you must abstract\r\n      mine in order to have as little to say as possible yourself.\r\n      Let them feel it, and point the moral.\"\r\n\r\nThe last-named difficulty, to which Lyell refers in another part of this\r\nletter, was undoubtedly one of the most formidable \"rocks ahead\" in the\r\npath of his new book. Up to that time the progress of geology had been\r\nmost seriously impeded by the supposed necessity of making its results\r\nharmonise with the Mosaic cosmogony. It was assumed as an axiom that the\r\nopening chapters of Genesis were to be understood in the strict literal\r\nsense of the words, and that to admit the possibility of misconceptions\r\nor mistakes in matters wholly beyond the cognisance of the writers, was\r\na denial of the inspiration of Scripture, and was rank blasphemy. A\r\nlarge number of persons--among whom are the great mass of amateur\r\ntheologians, together with some experts--are always very prone to\r\nassume the meaning of certain fundamental terms to be exactly that\r\nwhich they desire, and then to proceed deductively to a conclusion as if\r\ntheir questionable postulates were axiomatic truths. They further\r\nassume, very commonly, that the possession of theological\r\nknowledge--scanty and superficial though it may be--enables them to\r\ndispense with any study of science, and to pronounce authoritatively on\r\nthe value of evidence which they are incapable of weighing, and of\r\nconclusions which they are too ignorant to test. Being thus, in their\r\nown opinion, infallible, a freedom of expression is, for them, more than\r\npermissible, which, in most other matters, would be generally held to\r\ntransgress the limits of courtesy and to trespass on those of\r\nvituperation. Lyell had perceived that little real progress could be\r\nmade till geologists were free to look facts in the face and to follow\r\ntheir guidance to whatever conclusions these might lead, irrespective of\r\nsupposed consequences; or that, in other words, questions of science\r\nmust be settled by inductive reasoning from accurate observations, and\r\nnot by an appeal to the opinions of the men of olden time, however great\r\nmight be the sanctity of their characters or the honour due to their\r\nmemories. Wisely, however, he determined to prefer an indirect to a\r\ndirect method of attack, and to avoid, so far as was possible, giving\r\nneedlessly any cause of offence by abruptness of statement or by\r\nintemperance of language.\r\n\r\nIn deluges, the favourite resort of every \"catastrophic\" geologist,\r\nLyell had long lost faith, and he laughs in one of his letters at the\r\nidea of a French geologist, that a sudden upheaval of South America may\r\nhave been the cause of the Noachian flood. To the breaks in the\r\nsuccession of strata, a fact upon which the catastrophists much relied,\r\nhe attached comparatively little value, insisting on their more or less\r\nlocal character. In the records of the rocks he finds no trace of a\r\nclean sweep of living creatures or of anything like a general clearance\r\nof the earth's surface, and no corroboration of the Mosaic cosmogony. He\r\nis bent on interpreting the work of Nature in the past by the work of\r\nNature in the present, and not by the writings of the Fathers, or even\r\nby the words of Scripture itself.\r\n\r\nSome time in the month of June the last sheet of the \"Principles\" must\r\nhave been sent to press; for on the 25th of that month Lyell writes from\r\nHavre on his way to Bordeaux, through part of Normandy, Brittany, and La\r\nVendee. This journey took him, as he says, \"through some of the finest\r\ncountries and most detestable roads he ever saw.\" On this occasion he\r\nwas accompanied by a Captain Cooke, a commander in the Royal Navy; a man\r\nwell informed, acquainted with Spain (the end of their journey), a\r\nbotanist, and not wholly ignorant of geology--in short, an excellent\r\ncompanion, whose only fault was being \"a little too fond of lagging a\r\nday for rest,\" even in places where nothing is to be done. Writing from\r\nBordeaux to a sister, Lyell expresses a hope that at Bagneres de Luchon\r\nhe may hear whether his book is out.[35] Two passages in his letter are\r\nnot without a more general interest. One repeats a remark made to him by\r\nD'Aubuisson, whom he describes as \"a great gun of the old Wernerian\r\nschool, who ... thinks the interest of the subject greatly destroyed by\r\nour new innovation, especially our having almost cut mineralogy and\r\nturned it into a zoological science.\"[36] D'Aubuisson also said, \"We\r\n_Catholic_ geologists flatter ourselves that we have kept clear of the\r\nmixing of things sacred and profane, but the three great Protestants, De\r\nLuc, Cuvier, and Buckland, have not done so; have they done good to\r\nscience or to religion? No, but some say they have to themselves by it.\"\r\nThe other remark is interesting in its reference to French politics,\r\nseeing that it is dated on the 9th of July, 1830. It runs thus[37]:--\r\n\r\n      \"The quiet and perfect order and calmness that reigned at\r\n      Bourbon, Vendee, and Bordeaux and Toulouse during the heat\r\n      of the elections, afford a noble example to us--never were\r\n      people in a greater state of excitement on political grounds\r\n      than the French at this moment, yet never in our country\r\n      towns were Assizes conducted with more seriousness and\r\n      quiet. There is no occasion to make the rabble drunk. All\r\n      the voters of the little colleges are of the rank of\r\n      shopkeepers at least, those of the highest are\r\n      gentlemen--only 20,000 of them out of the 30 millions of\r\n      French. They are too many for such jobbing as in a Scotch\r\n      county, and too independent and rich to have the feelings of\r\n      a mob.\"\r\n\r\nYet at the end of this month came the \"three days of July\"; \"perfect\r\norder and calmness\" were at an end; Charles X. abdicated the throne, and\r\nthe Bourbons again became exiles from France.\r\n\r\nFrom Toulouse Lyell and his companion journeyed by the banks of the\r\nAriege to the picturesque old town of Foix, and from this place to Ax,\r\na watering-place on one of the tributaries to that river, in the heart\r\nof the Pyrenees. His keen eye notes at once the difference between the\r\nscenery of this chain and that of the Alps. Apart from the different\r\ncharacter of the vegetation--the more luxuriant flora, the extensive\r\nforests of beech and oak at elevations where in Switzerland only the\r\npines and larches would flourish--the valleys are narrower, the\r\nmountains more precipitous--the scenery, in short, is more like that\r\naround Interlaken or in the valley of Lauterbrunnen, without the lakes\r\nof the one or the grand background of snowy peaks in the other. In the\r\nPyrenees the inferior height and the more southern position of the chain\r\ndiminishes the snowfields and curtails the glaciers, so that the\r\ntorrents run with purer waters, like they do in the Alps about the\r\nbirthplace of the Po.\r\n\r\nIn order to acquire a clear idea of the structure of the Pyrenees the\r\ntravellers crossed from Ax to the southern side of the watershed, though\r\nthey still remained on French territory; for here, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Andorre, the frontier cuts off the heads of one or two valleys which\r\ngeographically form part of Spain. Into this country they had purposed\r\nto descend, but the obstacles interposed by the reactionary jealousy of\r\nlocal Dogberries and the possible risks from political complications\r\nwere so great, that they judged it wiser to abandon the attempt. So the\r\ntravellers separated for a time, Captain Cooke, who feared the heat of\r\nthe lower country, going eastwards through the curious little mountain\r\nrepublic of Andorre to Luchon; while Lyell, who seems to have been\r\nproof against the sun, recrossed the watershed into the valley of the\r\nTet and descended it to Perpignan. Information obtained in this town\r\nencouraged him to go direct to Barcelona, where the Captain-General, the\r\nConde D'Espagne, a distinguished soldier and diplomatist, gave him a\r\ncourteous reception, and did everything in his power to smooth the way\r\nfor a visit to Olot, a region of extinct volcanoes, which had been one\r\nof the chief ends of Lyell's journey. The expedition was successful; he\r\ndid not fall among thieves, and was only annoyed by the tedious\r\nformalities and petty impertinences of the local functionaries of\r\nnorthern Spain; and he returned to France by a pass on the eastern side\r\nof the Canigou. He was not a little astonished, as might be expected\r\nfrom the remarks already quoted, when he found on arriving in that\r\ncountry that the reign of the Bourbons and the priests was over, the\r\ntricolor flag was hoisted on all the churches, and the royalist\r\nofficials had been replaced by the nominees of the National Government.\r\n\r\nThe visit to Olot amply repaid him for the toil and trouble of the\r\njourney. An account of the district was inserted in the concluding\r\nvolume of the \"Principles,\" which was afterwards incorporated into the\r\n\"Elements of Geology.\" The following summary is quoted from a letter to\r\nScrope, who had suggested the visit, which was written from Luchon,\r\nwhere he arrived a few days after his return into France[38]:--\r\n\r\n      \"Like those of the Vivarais [the volcanoes of Catalonia] are\r\n      all, both cones and craters, subsequent to the existence of\r\n      the actual hills and dales, or, in other words, no\r\n      alteration of previously existing levels accompanied or has\r\n      followed the introduction of the volcanic matter, except\r\n      such as the matter erupted necessarily occasioned. The\r\n      cones, at least fourteen of them mostly with craters, stand\r\n      like Monpezat, and as perfect; the currents flow down where\r\n      the rivers would be if not displaced. But here, as in the\r\n      Vivarais, deep sections have been cut through the lava by\r\n      streams much smaller in general, and at certain points the\r\n      lava is fairly cut through, and even in two or three cases\r\n      the subjacent rock. Thus at Castel Follet, a great current\r\n      near its termination is cut through, and eighty or ninety\r\n      feet of columnar basalt laid open, resting on an old\r\n      alluvium, not containing volcanic pebbles; and below that,\r\n      nummulitic limestone is eroded to the depth of twenty-five\r\n      feet, the river now being about thirty-five feet lower than\r\n      when the lava flowed, though most of the old valley is still\r\n      occupied by the lava current. There are about fourteen or\r\n      perhaps twenty points of eruption without craters. In all\r\n      cases they burst through secondary limestone and sandstone,\r\n      no altered rocks thrown up, as far as I could learn, not a\r\n      dike exposed. A linear direction in the cones and points of\r\n      eruption from north to south. Until some remains of\r\n      quadrupeds are found, or other organic medals found, no\r\n      guess can be made as to their geological date, unless anyone\r\n      will undertake to say when the valleys of that district were\r\n      excavated. As to historical dates, that is all a fudge ... I\r\n      can assure you that there never was an eruption within\r\n      memory of man.\"\r\n\r\nAt Luchon Lyell rejoined Captain Cooke, and they visited one or two\r\ninteresting spots in the more western part of the Pyrenees, such as the\r\nCirque de Gavarnie and the Breche de Roland. The former would afford\r\nobject-lessons on the erosive action of cascades; the latter would set\r\nhim speculating on the causes which could have fashioned that strange\r\nportal in the limestone crest of the mountain. They descended some\r\ndistance on the Spanish side of the Breche, in order to make a more\r\ncomplete investigation of the structure of the chain, sleeping at a\r\nshepherd's hut and returning across the snowfields next day. It is\r\nevident that whenever there was a hope of securing any geological\r\ninformation or of seeing some remarkable aspect of nature, Lyell was\r\nalmost insensible either to heat or to fatigue.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of September he had reached Bayonne, from which place\r\nanother very interesting letter is despatched to Scrope.[39] In this he\r\ngives suggestions for making a number of experiments in order to produce\r\nby artificial means such rock-structures as lamination, ripple-mark, and\r\ncurrent-bedding, and describes briefly a series of observations bearing\r\non these questions, which had been carried out both during his late\r\njourney and on other occasions. \"I have,\" he says, \"for a long time been\r\nmaking minute drawings of the lamination and stratification of beds, in\r\nformations of very different ages, first with a view to prove to\r\ndemonstration that at every epoch the same identical causes were in\r\noperation. I was next led in Scotland to a suspicion, since confirmed,\r\nthat all the minute regularities and irregularities of stratification\r\nand lamination were preserved in primary clay-slate, mica-slate, gneiss,\r\netc., showing that they had been subjected to the same general and even\r\naccidental circumstances attending the sedimentary accumulation of\r\nsecondary and fossil-bearing formations.[40] Lastly, I came to find out\r\nthat all these various characters were identical with those presented\r\nby the bars, deltas, etc., of existing rivers, estuaries, etc.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in October Lyell is back again in Paris, to find Louis Philippe\r\nseated on the throne in the place of Charles X., and a war party\r\n\"praying night and day for the entry of the Prussians into Belgium in\r\nthe hope of the French being drawn into the affair. A finer opportunity,\r\nthey say, could not have happened for resuming our natural limits on the\r\nRhine.\" In the midst of political changes and warlike aspirations\r\ngeology, he observes, is not making much progress in Paris. Some of the\r\nnaturalists have \"got their heads too full of politics\"; others are\r\nforced to work as literary hacks in order to live. \"Books on natural\r\nhistory and medicine have no sale; there is a demand only for political\r\npamphlets.\" So Lyell enters into an engagement with Deshayes, who, like\r\nso many others, has to live by his pen lest he should starve by science,\r\nfor \"a private course of fossil conchology,\" and for two months' work\r\nafter Lyell has returned to England, to be spent in tabulating the\r\nspecies of Tertiary shells in his own (Deshayes') and the other great\r\ncollections of Paris. \"I shall thus,\" Lyell says, \"be giving the subject\r\na decided push by rendering the greater wealth of the French collectors\r\navailable in illustrating the greater experience of the English\r\ngeologists in actual observation; for here they sit still and buy\r\nshells, and work indoors, as much as we travel.\" He also remarks to the\r\nsame correspondent (a sister): \"I am nearly sure now that my grand\r\ntheory of temperature will carry the day.... I will treat our geologists\r\nwith a theory for the newer deposits in next volume, which, although\r\nnot half so original, will perhaps surprise them more.\"[41] He was\r\nexpecting, as another letter shows, to prove the gradual approximation\r\nof the fauna preserved in the Tertiary deposits to that which still\r\nexists, and to settle, as he hopes \"for ever, the question whether\r\nspecies come in all at a batch or are always going out and coming in.\"\r\nAlready he is in a position to affirm that the Tertiary formations of\r\nSicily in all probability are more recent than the \"crags\" of England,\r\nfor, among the sixty-three species which he had collected from the beds\r\nunderlying Etna, only three were not known to be still inhabitants of\r\nthe Mediterranean; and besides this, between these \"crags\" and the\r\nLondon clay a series of formations can be intercalated. In the same\r\nletter (to Scrope)[42] he states that Deshayes has found, at St. Mihiel\r\non the Meuse, three old needles of limestone, like those in the Isle of\r\nWight, round which run three distinct lines of perforations, like those\r\non the columns of the \"Temple of Serapis;\" these hollows being\r\n\"sometimes empty, but thousands of them filled with saxicavas.\" This, of\r\ncourse, was a proof that there had been, in comparatively recent times,\r\nimportant changes in the level of the land and sea.\r\n\r\nEarly in November Lyell is back in London, at his chambers in Crown\r\nOffice Row, Temple, to find that Scrope's review of the first volume of\r\nthe \"Principles\" has been much admired, that the book is selling\r\nsteadily, and is likely to prove \"as good as an annuity\"; that it has\r\nnot been seriously attacked by the \"Diluvialists,\" while it has been\r\nhighly praised by the bulk of geologists. He is about to move, he\r\nwrites, into chambers in Raymond Buildings, Gray's Inn, which are \"very\r\nlight, healthy and good, on the same staircase as Broderip.\" Invitations\r\nto dinner are becoming frequent, but he wisely determines to go but\r\nlittle into society. \"All my friends,\" he says, \"who are in practice do\r\nthis all the year and every year, and I do not see why I should not be\r\nprivileged, now that I have the moral certainty of earning a small but\r\nhonourable independence if I labour as hard for the next ten years as\r\nduring the last three. I was never in better health, rarely so good, and\r\nafter so long a fallow I feel that a good crop will be yielded and that\r\nI am in good train for composition.\"[43] The second volume, he hopes,\r\nwill be out in six months; this will include the history of the globe to\r\nthe beginning of the Tertiary era, when the first of existing species\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1831, was an epoch marked by more than one change. To\r\ntake the smallest first, he was made a deputy-lieutenant of the county\r\nof Forfar; next, in March, he was elected Professor of Geology at King's\r\nCollege, London, which had been recently founded by members of the\r\nChurch of England as an educational counterpoise to the University of\r\nLondon (University College). To Lyell himself the appointment was\r\ncomparatively unimportant, but it indicated that wider views on\r\nscientific questions and a more tolerant spirit were gaining ground\r\namong the higher ranks of the clergy in the Established Church. The\r\nappointment was in the hands, exclusively, of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, the Bishops of London and of Llandaff, and two \"strictly\r\northodox doctors.\" Llandaff, Lyell was informed, hesitated, but\r\nConybeare,[44] though opposed to Lyell's theories, vouched for his\r\northodoxy. So the prelates declared that they \"considered some of my\r\ndoctrines startling enough, but could not find that they were come by\r\notherwise than in a straight-forward manner, and (as I appeared to\r\nthink) logically deducible from the facts; so that whether the facts\r\nwere true or not, or my conclusions logical or otherwise, there was no\r\nreason to infer that I had made my theory from any hostile feeling\r\ntowards revelation\"[45]--a conclusion, marked by a wise caution, which\r\nrepresentatives of the Church of England would have done well to bear in\r\nmind on more than one subsequent occasion--such as, for example, when\r\nthe question of the antiquity of man or that of the origin of species\r\nwas raised. But supporters of the Church of England may fairly maintain\r\nthat in difficult crises, especially in those connected with discoveries\r\nin science or in history, the utterances of her bishops have been\r\ngenerally cautious and far-seeing; displays of confident ignorance and\r\nrash denunciations are more common among the \"inferior clergy.\" As a\r\ncomment on the moderation indicated by his election, Lyell says that a\r\nfriend in the United States affirms that there \"he could hardly dare to\r\napprove of the doctrines even in a review, such a storm would the\r\northodox raise against him. So much for toleration of Church\r\nEstablishment and No Church Establishment countries.\" A third event of\r\nthe year--which also happened in the earlier part of it--was destined to\r\nexercise a much more lasting influence upon his life. This was his\r\nengagement to Miss Mary Horner, eldest daughter of Mr. Leonard Horner,\r\nthe younger and hardly less distinguished brother of Francis Horner,\r\nwho, while almost as enthusiastic a geologist as his future son-in-law,\r\ntook an active interest in educational questions, and afterwards did\r\npublic service as Inspector of Factories.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of June Lyell had advanced as far as page 110 in printing\r\nthe second volume of the \"Principles of Geology,\" notwithstanding\r\ninterruptions, such as a visit to Cambridge, where he took an _ad\r\neundem_ degree,[46] and the presence of his father and brother, as well\r\nas of his friend Conybeare, in London, all of whom required to be\r\nlionised. The letter[47] (to Mantell) which refers to these impediments,\r\npasses abruptly from Fitton's broken arm to the giant femur of a new\r\nreptile, and incidentally mentions the discovery of a section which has\r\nsince become a centre of geological controversy. \"Murchison and his\r\nwife,\" he writes, \"are gone to make a tour in Wales, where a certain\r\nTrimmer has found near Snowdon 'crag' shells at a height of 1,000 feet,\r\nwhich Buckland and he convey thither by the deluge.\" The shells are at\r\nan altitude above sea-level considerably higher than Lyell supposed.\r\nMoel Tryfaen is a massive, rather outlying hill, about five miles west\r\nof the peak of Snowdon, and at about the same distance from the nearest\r\npart of the sea-coast. Its bare summit rises gently to a scattered group\r\nof projecting crags, the highest of which is 1,401 feet above the sea.\r\nOn the eastern side are extensive slate quarries, and in working these\r\nthe shell beds are disclosed a short distance below the summit. They\r\nconsist of well-stratified sands, with occasional gravelly beds, and\r\ncontain a fair number of shells, both broken and whole, the fauna being\r\nslightly more arctic than that which still inhabits the neighbouring\r\nsea. The deposit is now recognised as more recent than the \"crags\" of\r\nEast Anglia, for none of the species are extinct, and is assigned to\r\nsome part of the so-called Glacial Epoch. It was before long regarded as\r\nan indication that, at no very remote date after North Wales had assumed\r\nor very nearly assumed its present outlines, the whole district was\r\ndepressed for at least 1,380 feet, so that the sea broke over the summit\r\ncrags of Moel Tryfaen. For many years this interpretation passed\r\nunquestioned; but a modern school of geologists has found it to be such\r\nan inconvenient obstacle to certain hypotheses about the former extent\r\nof land-ice, that they maintain these shells were collected from the bed\r\nof the Irish Sea (then supposed to be above water) by an ice-sheet as it\r\nwas on its way from the north to invade the Principality, and were\r\nconveyed by it, with all care, up the slopes of Moel Tryfaen, till they\r\nwere finally deposited on its summit, in beds which somehow or other\r\nwere stratified. One may venture to doubt whether the hypothesis of a\r\nrampant and conchologically-disposed ice-sheet would have found much\r\nmore favour with the cautiously inductive mind of Lyell than that of a\r\ndeluge.\r\n\r\nShortly after this letter, Lyell, though all the manuscript of his\r\nsecond volume had not yet been sent to the printers, and proof-sheets\r\nfollowed him, refreshed himself with a tour of four or five weeks in the\r\nvolcanic district of the Eifel. Here the cones, all comparatively low,\r\nare scattered sporadically over a rolling upland which occupies the\r\nangle between the Rhine and the Moselle. The valleys for the most part\r\nare carved out of slaty rocks much of the same age as those of\r\nDevonshire; and the craters, \"strange holes, each eruption having been\r\nalmost invariably at some new point,\" are now very commonly occupied by\r\nquiet pools of water, such as Lyell had already seen in the old volcanic\r\ndistricts of the Papal States. Among these craters, composed sometimes\r\nof loose and light scoria, from which no lava-stream ever flowed, he\r\nfound fresh evidence--as at the Rotherberg--against the diluvian\r\nhypothesis. \"It is,\" as he writes to his friend, Dr. Fleming, \"one of\r\nthe ten thousand proofs of the incubus that the Mosaic deluge has been,\r\nand is, I fear, long destined to be, on our science. Now, I am fully\r\ndetermined to open my strongest fire against the new diluvial theory of\r\nswamping our continents by waves raised by paroxysmal earthquakes. I can\r\nprove by reference to cones (hundreds of uninjured cones) of loose\r\nvolcanic scoriae and ashes, of various and some of great antiquity (as\r\nproved by associated organic remains), that no such general waves have\r\nswept over Europe during the Tertiary era--cones at almost every height,\r\nfrom near the sea, to thousands of feet above it.\"[48]\r\n\r\nBut early in August he was back in London, hard at work in writing and\r\ncorrecting proofs. This business detained him longer than he\r\nanticipated, but his labours were cheered by the news of the eruption of\r\nGraham's Island. Here was another case in support of the thesis which he\r\nwas ready to maintain against all comers. But a few months since there\r\nhad been a depth of eighty fathoms, as was proved by sounding, on the\r\nsite of this island. Now the cone \"is 200 feet above water and is still\r\ngrowing.[49] Here is a hill 680 feet, with hope of more, and the\r\nprobability of much having been done before the 'Britannia' sounded.\"\r\nSurely Nature herself was testifying \"her approbation of the advocates\r\nof modern causes! Was the cross which Constantine saw in the heavens a\r\nmore clear indication of the approaching conversion of a wavering\r\nworld?\"\r\n\r\nBut in the beginning of September Lyell broke away from the emissaries\r\nof the press and took passage by sea to Edinburgh, there to combine\r\nbusiness with a fair amount of both scientific work and social pleasure.\r\nThis visit afforded him an opportunity of hearing Chalmers preach. In a\r\nletter to Miss Horner he gives a brief abstract, and expresses his\r\ngeneral opinion of the sermon[50]:--\r\n\r\n      \"It was a very long discourse, but admirable. The subject\r\n      was 'repentance,' a hackneyed one enough.... He explained\r\n      the effect of habit, and its increasing power over the mind,\r\n      as a law of our nature, with as much clearness and as\r\n      philosophically as he could have done had he been explaining\r\n      the doctrine to a class of university students in a lecture\r\n      on the philosophy of the human mind. But then the practical\r\n      application was enforced by a strain of real eloquence, of a\r\n      very energetic, natural, and striking description.... But,\r\n      unfortunately, every here and there he seemed to feel that\r\n      he was sinning against some of the Calvinistic doctrines of\r\n      his school, and all at once there was some dexterous\r\n      pleading about 'original sin,' which interfered a little\r\n      with the free current of the discourse.... Upon the whole,\r\n      however, judging from this single specimen, I think I would\r\n      sooner hear him again than any preacher I ever heard,\r\n      Reginald Heber not excepted.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Lyell was keeping a journal, which was forwarded to Miss\r\nHorner, then in Germany, to serve apparently as a substitute for\r\nordinary letters; home news, disturbances arising from the struggle over\r\nthe Reform Bill, visits of friends, geological researches, walks on the\r\nhills to search for plants or for insects, the habits of the Kinnordy\r\nbees, or the accomplishments of two parrots, brought from Africa by his\r\nnaval brother--all being jotted down just as they occurred.\r\n\r\nAmong this _farrago_--though not of nonsense--geological topics, since\r\nMiss Horner had similar tastes, occupy a considerable space. She,\r\nhowever, evidently was, comparatively speaking, a beginner, and in one\r\nor two characteristic sentences her lover and preceptor passes from\r\ninformation to counsel: \"If you are not frightened by De la Beche, I\r\nthink you are in a fair way to be a geologist; though it is in the field\r\nonly that a person can really get to like the stiff part of it. Not that\r\nthere is really anything in it that is not very easy, when put into\r\nplainer language than scientific writers choose often unnecessarily to\r\nemploy.\" He also records[51] a piece of advice from his old friend, Dr.\r\nFleming, which is enough to make a modern professor of geology sigh for\r\n\"the good old times.\" He said to Lyell:\r\n\r\n      \"If you lecture once a year for a short course, I am sure\r\n      you will derive advantage from it. A short practice of\r\n      lecturing is a rehearsal of what you may afterwards publish,\r\n      and teaches you by the contact with pupils how to instruct,\r\n      and in what you are obscure. A little of this will improve\r\n      your power, perhaps as an author. Then, as you are pursuing\r\n      a path of original and purely independent discovery and\r\n      observation, it increases much your public usefulness in a\r\n      science so unavoidably controversial to have thrown over you\r\n      the _moral protection_ of being in a public and responsible\r\n      situation, connected with a body like King's College. But\r\n      then you must stipulate that you are to be free to travel,\r\n      and must only be bound to give one short course annually.\"\r\n\r\nTruly those must have been halcyon days for professors!\r\n\r\nThe journal also proves, by its brief account of a Scotch festival,\r\nwhich accords with little hints dropped elsewhere in it or in letters,\r\nthat our forefathers, not wholly excluding men of science, some sixty\r\nyears ago habitually consumed much more \"strong drink\" than would be\r\nconsidered correct at the present day:--\r\n\r\n      \"It was just an Angus set-to of the old _regime_. They\r\n      arrived at half-past six o'clock and waited dinner one hour.\r\n      Gentlemen rejoined the ladies at half-past twelve o'clock!\r\n      They, in the meantime, had had tea, and a regular supper\r\n      laid out in the drawing-room. After an hour with the ladies\r\n      they returned to the dining-room to supper at half-past one\r\n      o'clock, and my father left them at half-past two o'clock!\r\n      The ladies did not go to _this_ supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe journal, in short, like the well-known Scotch dish, affords a great\r\ndeal of \"confused feeding\" of a pleasant sort, but no samples of\r\nlove-making. The nearest approach to it is in the following passage,\r\nwhich is worth quoting, not for that reason, but as incidentally\r\ndisclosing the strength of the author's character:--\r\n\r\n      \"I shall write a few words before I get into the steamboat\r\n      just to tranquillise my mind a little, after reading several\r\n      controversial articles by Elie de Beaumont and others\r\n      against my system. If I find myself growing too warm or\r\n      annoyed at such hostile demonstrations I shall always\r\n      retreat to you. You will be my harbour of peace to retire\r\n      to, and where I may forget the storm. I know that by\r\n      persevering steadily I shall some years hence stand very\r\n      differently from where I now am in science; and my only\r\n      danger is the being impatient, and tempted to waste my time\r\n      on petty controversies and quarrels about the priority of\r\n      the discovery of this or that fact or theory.\"[52]\r\n\r\nFriends in plenty were awaiting him in London, which was reached about\r\nthe first of November: the Murchisons and Somervilles, Broderip, Curtis,\r\nBasil Hall, and Hooker, with Necker from Switzerland, and many more. He\r\nis also cheered by finding that his ideas are steadily gaining ground\r\namong geologists, converts becoming more confident, unbelievers more\r\nuneasy. He made good progress with his book, and realised, before the\r\nend of the year, that his materials could not be compressed into a\r\nsingle volume; so he determined to issue the part already completed as a\r\nsecond volume, and to finish the work in a third.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the diary contains references to a recent contest for\r\nthe Presidency of the Royal Society, and to political matters such as\r\nthe Reform Bill; but, though in favour of the latter, he is not very\r\nenthusiastic on the subject, for on one occasion he expresses regret at\r\nhaving been absent, through forgetfulness, from a meeting of the\r\nGeographical Society, where he would have \"got some sound information\r\ninstead of hearing politicians discuss the interminable bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe lectures at King's College evidently weighed upon his mind as they\r\ndrew near, and he was not stirred to enthusiasm by the prospect of\r\nteaching; for towards the close of the year he more than once debated\r\nwith his friends the question whether or no he should retain the\r\nappointment. Murchison was in favour of resignation; Conybeare took the\r\nopposite view. Of his advice Lyell remarks, \"The fact is, Conybeare's\r\nnotion of these things is what the English public have not yet come up\r\nto, which, if they had, the geological professorship in London would be\r\na worthy aim for any man's ambition, whereas it is now one that the\r\nmultitude would rather wonder at one's accepting.\"[53] The British\r\npublic apparently still lags a long way behind the Conybearian ideal,\r\nand retains its contempt for all those who, by presuming to teach,\r\ninsinuate doubts as to its innate omniscience.\r\n\r\nLyell, however, clearly perceived that it was absolutely necessary that\r\nevery teacher of professorial rank should be himself a pioneer in his\r\nsubject--a fact of which government officials, as a rule, seem to be\r\ntotally ignorant. His comments, a little later in the year, on the\r\narrangements at the University of Bonn are worth recording. \"The\r\nProfessors have to lecture for nine months in the year--too much, I\r\nshould think, for allowing time for due advancement of the teacher.\"\r\nLyell's desires in regard to remuneration seem reasonable enough. He is\r\nanxious to earn by his scientific work enough to provide for the extra\r\nexpenses which this work entails, and yet to command sufficient time to\r\nadvance his knowledge and reputation. The fates proved more propitious\r\nto him than they are generally to men of science, for he succeeded in\r\naccomplishing both of his desires.\r\n\r\nLittle of importance happened during the early part of 1832. There was\r\nplenty of hard work in collecting facts, in consulting friends about\r\nspecial difficulties, and in working at the manuscript for the third\r\nvolume of the \"Principles,\" for the second made its appearance almost\r\nwith the new year. Toil was sweetened by occasional pleasures, such as\r\nan evening with the Somervilles, or a dinner party at the Murchisons, a\r\ntalk with Babbage or Fitton, or a symposium at the Geological Club, at\r\nwhich it is sometimes evident that good care was taken lest science\r\nshould become too dry. One passage in his diary indicates that sixty\r\nyears have considerably changed the habits of life in town and in the\r\ncountry, for at the present day most people would express themselves in\r\nthe opposite sense. \"I have enjoyed parties and two plays this month\r\nvery much, because it was recreation stolen from work; but the\r\ndifficulty in the country is that, on the contrary, one's hours of work\r\nare stolen from dissipation.\"\r\n\r\nThe lectures at King's College were begun in May. Lyell evidently was\r\nnot a nervous man, but he regarded the near approach of this new kind of\r\nwork with some trepidation, and admits that he slept ill before the\r\nfirst lecture. It was, however, a decided success in every respect, and\r\nthe audience was a large one, for the Council, after some hesitation,\r\nhad permitted the attendance of ladies. Each lecture was pronounced by\r\nthe hearers to be better than the last, and Lyell uses the opportunity,\r\nas he says, to fire occasional shots at Buckland, Sedgwick, and others\r\nwho are still hankering after catastrophic convulsions and all-but\r\nuniversal deluges. As a further encouragement, his publisher, Murray,\r\nagrees willingly to a reprint of the first volume of the \"Principles,\"\r\nand only hesitates between an edition of 750 or of 1,000 copies. About\r\nthis time, also, he was asked to undertake the presidency of the\r\nGeological Society, but that, notwithstanding Murchison's urgency, he\r\nfirmly declined for the present; writing of it to Miss Horner, \"It is\r\njust one of those temptations the resisting of which decides whether a\r\nman shall really rise high or not in science. For two more years I am\r\nfree from _les affaires administratives_, which, said old Brochart in\r\nhis late letter to me, have prevented _me_ from studying geology _d'une\r\nmaniere suivie_, whereby _you_ have already carried it so far.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, however, soon to be engrossed in an \"affair\" of another kind;\r\none which has proved very detrimental to the progress of many men of\r\nscience, but which, in Lyell's case, had the happiest results, and\r\nsmoothed rather than it impeded his path to fame; for in the summer--on\r\nJuly 12th--he ceased to be a bachelor. The marriage was celebrated at\r\nBonn, where Miss Horner's family were still resident. A Lutheran\r\nclergyman seems to have officiated, and the ceremony was a very quiet\r\none; the distance from home preventing the attendance of English friends\r\nor even of relations of the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nThe newly-married couple departed from Bonn up the Rhine, and travelled\r\nby successive stages to Heidelberg, but they were not forgetful of\r\ngeology, even in the first week of the honeymoon, for they visited as\r\nthey journeyed more than one interesting section on the western edge of\r\nthe Odenwald. Then they made excursions to Carlsruhe and Baden-Baden,\r\nand ultimately travelled from Freiburg to Schaffhausen through the\r\nromantic defiles of the Hoellenthal, and across the corner of the Black\r\nForest. A journal was now needless, and probably the newly-married\r\ncouple were too much engrossed with their own happiness to write many\r\nletters, for few details have been preserved about their Swiss tour. It\r\nwas, however, comparatively a short one, for they remained less than a\r\nfortnight in the country. Still Lyell probably found it useful in\r\nrefreshing recollections and testing his early impressions by greatly\r\nincreased knowledge and experience. From the valley of the Rhone they\r\ncrossed the Simplon Pass into Italy and followed the usual road to Milan\r\nalong the shore of the Lago Maggiore.\r\n\r\nHow long they remained in Italy, or by what route they returned to\r\nEngland, is not stated; indeed, for nearly six months next to nothing is\r\non record concerning Lyell's movements or work, but in the beginning of\r\n1833 he and his wife were settled in London at No. 16, Hart Street,\r\nBloomsbury, which became their residence for some years. A state of\r\nhappiness is not always indicated by much correspondence: probably it\r\nwas so with Lyell; at any rate, a single letter, dated January 5th,\r\ngives the only information of his doings between September, 1832, and\r\nApril, 1833. In this letter, however, he mentions that the Council of\r\nKing's College had decided that in future ladies should not be admitted\r\nto Lyell's lectures, and that, in consequence, he had received a\r\npressing invitation from the managers of the Royal Institution to give,\r\nafter Easter, a course of six or eight lectures in their theatre,\r\ncoupled with the offer of a substantial remuneration.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April, as he tells his old friend Mantell, both these\r\ncourses had been begun. The one at the Royal Institution was attended by\r\nan audience of about 250, that at King's College, after the opening\r\nlecture, dropped down to a class of fifteen. The falling-off was\r\nentirely due to the above-named resolution. For this the Council had\r\nassigned a reason, which, perhaps, was not a prudent course, for bodies\r\nof that kind, when they give reasons, often succeed only in \"giving\r\nthemselves away.\" The presence of ladies was forbidden, \"because it\r\ndiverted the attention of the young students, of whom,\" Lyell remarks\r\nsarcastically, \"I had _two_ in number from the college last year and\r\n_two_ this.\" Had the Council stated boldly that the College did not\r\nappoint professors to lecture _urbi et orbi_, their policy, though it\r\nwould have appeared a little selfish and might have proved shortsighted,\r\nwould have been defensible, because the institution was founded for the\r\neducation of a particular class. But the reason assigned was open to\r\nLyell's retort, and gave the impression of unreality. It is not\r\nimpossible that the decision was the result of secret \"wire-pulling,\"\r\nand represented not so much a fear of the disturbing influence of the\r\nfair sex as a dread of the popularity of the subject. Geology was still\r\nregarded with grave distrust by a very large number of people, and\r\nKing's College, it must be remembered, was founded in the supposed\r\ninterests of the Church of England and in the hope of neutralising the\r\neffects of the unsectarian institution in Gower Street. Many of its\r\nsupporters may have been characterised rather by the ardour of their\r\ndislikes than by the width of their sympathies, and may have put\r\npressure on the Council, so that this body may have considered it safer\r\nto risk driving a popular man from their staff than to alienate an\r\nimportant section of their adherents and to expose the College to the\r\ndanger of being charged with lending itself to heretical teaching.[54]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of these lectures must have been attended with some\r\ndifficulty, for Lyell writes that, \"like all the world,\" he and his\r\nhousehold--everyone except his wife--had been down with the influenza,\r\nwhich in that year was even more rampant in London than it has been in\r\nany of its recent visits. But, notwithstanding this and any other\r\ninterruptions, the third and final volume of the \"Principles of Geology\"\r\nmade its appearance in the month of May, 1833.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 255.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ut supra_, p. 256.\r\n\r\n[31] Further work has not verified some of these statements. There can\r\nbe no question that a great deal of rock in the Alps is much older than\r\neven the Trias. The apparent superposition of crystalline schists to\r\nrocks with fossils is due to over-folding or over-thrust\r\nfaulting--_i.e._ the schists are the older rocks. Though the Secondary\r\nrocks of the Alps have undergone, in places, some modification and\r\nmineral changes, these are very different from the metamorphism of those\r\ncrystalline schists which have a stratified origin.\r\n\r\n[32] Now \"University College,\" London, having been incorporated by Royal\r\nCharter under that title in November, 1836.\r\n\r\n[33] _Ut supra_, p. 258.\r\n\r\n[34] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. pp. 269-271.\r\n\r\n[35] When he left the publisher had not decided whether it should be\r\nissued at once or kept back till October.\r\n\r\n[36] D'Aubuisson, as time has shown, foresaw a real danger.

It brought to a successful close a\r\nwork on which his energies had been definitely concentrated for nearly\r\nfive years, and for which he had been preparing himself during a\r\nconsiderably longer time. It placed him, before his fourth decade was\r\ncompleted, at once and beyond all question in the front rank of British\r\ngeologists; it carried his reputation to every country where that\r\nscience was cultivated. It proved the writer to be not only a careful\r\nobserver and a reasoner of exceptional inductive power, but also a man\r\nof general culture and a master of his mother tongue. The book,\r\nmoreover, marked an epoch in geology not less important; it produced an\r\ninfluence on the science greater and more permanent than any work which\r\nhad been previously written, or has since appeared--greater even than\r\nthe famous \"Origin of Species by Natural Selection,\" for that dealt only\r\nwith one portion of geology--viz. with palaeontology, while the method of\r\nthe Principles affected the science in every part. For a brief interval,\r\nthen, we may desert the biography of the author for that of the\r\nbook--the parent for his offspring--and call attention to one or two\r\ntopics which are more immediately connected with the book itself. A\r\nbrief sketch of its future history may be placed first; for, as its\r\nauthor was constantly labouring to improve and perfect his work, it\r\nunderwent many changes in form and arrangement during the\r\nremainder--some two-and-forty years--of his life, which will be better\r\nunderstood from a connected statement than if they have to be gathered\r\nfrom scattered references in the other chapters of his biography.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the \"Principles of Geology\" appeared, as has been\r\nmentioned, in January, 1830; the second in January, 1832; and the third\r\nin May, 1833. But a second edition of the first volume was issued in\r\nJanuary, 1832, and one of the second volume in the same month of 1833;\r\nthese were all in 8vo size. A new edition of the whole work was\r\npublished in May, 1834. This, however, took the form of four volumes\r\n12mo. This edition was called the third, because the first two volumes\r\nof the original work had gone through second editions. A fourth edition\r\nfollowed in June, 1835, and a fifth in March, 1837.\r\n\r\nThus far the \"Principles\" continued without any substantial alteration,\r\nbut the author made an important change in preparing the next edition.\r\nHe detached from it the latter part--practically, the matter comprised\r\nin the third volume of the original work. This he rewrote and published\r\nseparately as a single volume in July, 1838, under the title of\r\n\"Elements of Geology\"; a sixth edition of the \"Principles,\" thus\r\ncurtailed, appeared in three volumes 12mo, in June, 1840. The effect of\r\nthe change was to restrict the \"Principles\" mainly to the physical side\r\nof geology--to the subjects connected with the morphological changes\r\nwhich the earth and its inhabitants alike undergo. Thus it made the\r\ncontents of the book accord more strictly with its title, while the\r\n\"Elements\" indicated the working out of the aforesaid principles in the\r\npast history of the earth and its inhabitants--that is, the latter book\r\ndeals with the classification of rocks and fossils, or with petrology\r\nand historical geology. The subsequent history of the \"Elements\" may be\r\nleft for the present.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1847, the seventh edition of the \"Principles\" appeared, in\r\nwhich another change was made. This, however, was in form rather than in\r\nsubstance, for the book was now issued in a single thick 8vo volume. The\r\neighth edition, published in May, 1850; and the ninth, in June, 1853,\r\nfollowed the same pattern. A longer interval elapsed before the\r\nappearance of the tenth edition, and this was published in two volumes,\r\nthe first being issued in November, 1866, and the second in 1868. In\r\nthis interval--more than thirteen years--the science had made rapid\r\nprogress, and the process of revision had been in consequence more than\r\nusually searching. The author, as he states in the preface, had \"found\r\nit necessary entirely to rewrite some chapters, and recast others, and\r\nto modify or omit some passages given in former editions.\" Many new\r\ninstances were given to illustrate the effect which forces still at work\r\nhad produced upon the earth's crust, and these strengthened the evidence\r\nwhich had been already advanced. Into the accounts of Vesuvius and Etna\r\nmuch important matter was introduced, the result of visits which, as we\r\nshall find, Lyell made in 1857 and 1858; the chapters relating to the\r\nvicissitudes of climate in past geological ages were entirely rewritten,\r\ntogether with that discussing the connection between climate and the\r\ngeography of the earth's surface; and a chapter, practically new, was\r\ninserted, which considered \"how far former vicissitudes in climate may\r\nhave been influenced by astronomical changes; such as variations in the\r\neccentricity of the earth's orbit, changes in the obliquity of the\r\necliptic, and different phases of the precession of the equinoxes.\" But\r\nthe most important change was made in the later part of the book--the\r\nlast fifteen chapters.[55] These either were entirely new, or presented\r\nthe original material in a new aspect. In the earlier editions of his\r\nwork, Lyell had expressed himself dissatisfied, as we have already seen,\r\nwith the idea of the derivation of species from antecedent forms by some\r\nprocess of modification, and had pointed out the weak places in the\r\narguments which were advanced in its favour. But the evidence adduced by\r\nDarwin and Wallace in regard to the origin of species by natural\r\nselection, strengthened by the support of Hooker on the botanical side,\r\nhad removed the difficulties which the cruder statements of Lamarck and\r\nother predecessors had suggested to his mind, so that Lyell now appears\r\nas a convinced evolutionist. The question also of the antiquity of man\r\nis much more fully discussed than it had been in the earlier editions.\r\n\r\nConsiderable changes were introduced into the eleventh edition, which\r\nappeared in January, 1872, but these were chiefly additions which were\r\nmade possible by the rapidly increasing store of knowledge, as, for\r\ninstance, much important information concerning the deeper parts of the\r\nocean. On this interesting subject great light had been thrown by the\r\ncruises of the several exploring vessels, notably those of the\r\n_Lightning_, the _Bulldog_, and the _Porcupine_, commissioned by the\r\nBritish Government--cruises in the course of which soundings had been\r\ntaken and temperatures observed in the North Atlantic down to depths of\r\nabout 2,500 fathoms; and in the lowest parts of the western basin of the\r\nMediterranean. Samples also of the bottom had been obtained, and, in\r\nmany cases, even dredgers had been successfully employed at these\r\ndepths. Thanks to the skill of the mechanician, the way had been opened\r\nwhich led into a new fairyland of science. This was not, like some\r\nfabled Paradise, guarded by mountain fastnesses and precipitous ramparts\r\nof eternal snow; it was not encircled by storm-swept deserts, or\r\nsecluded in the furthest recesses of forests, hitherto impenetrable; but\r\nit lay deep in the silent abysses of ocean--on those vast plains, which\r\nare unruffled by the most furious gale, or by the wildest waves. In\r\nthese depths, beneath the tremendous pressure of so vast a thickness of\r\nwater, and far below the limits at which the existence of life had been\r\nsupposed to be possible, numbers of creatures had been discovered--many\r\nof them strange and novel: molluscs, sea-lilies, glassy sponges of\r\nunusual beauty--creatures often of ancient aspect, relics of a fauna\r\nelsewhere extinct; and the ocean floor, on and above which they moved,\r\nwas strewn with the white dust of countless coverings of tiny\r\nforaminifera, which, even if none were actually living, had fallen like\r\na gentle but incessant rain from the overhanging mass of water.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes were introduced into the twelfth edition of the\r\n\"Principles,\" upon which the author was engaged even up to the last few\r\nweeks of his life. The _Challenger_, it will be remembered, started on\r\nher memorable voyage of exploration at the close of the year in which\r\nthe eleventh edition had appeared; and though she did not actually\r\nreturn till after Lyell's death, notes of some of her most interesting\r\ndiscoveries had been communicated from time to time to the scientific\r\njournals of this country. The edition, however, was left incomplete. The\r\nfirst volume had been passed for the press, but the second was still\r\nunfinished; so that this twelfth edition was posthumous, the work of\r\nrevision having been finished by the author's nephew and heir, Mr.\r\nLeonard Lyell.\r\n\r\nBy such conscientious and unremitting labour, the scientific value of\r\nthe \"Principles\" was immensely increased; it kept always in step with\r\nthe advance of the science, but at the same time it lost, as was\r\ninevitable, a little of that literary charm and that sense of freshness\r\nwhich was at first so marked a characteristic. Books, like children, are\r\napt to lose some of their beauty as they increase in size and strength.\r\nOne must compare an early and a late edition, such as the first or third\r\nand the tenth or eleventh, in order to realise how great were the\r\nchanges in this passage from childhood to adolescence. New material was\r\nincorporated into every part; it makes its appearance sometimes on every\r\npage; changes are made in the order of the subjects; many chapters are\r\nentirely rewritten; nevertheless, a considerable portion corresponds\r\nalmost word for word in the two editions. Lyell was no hurried writer,\r\nor \"scamper\" of work; he paid great attention to composition, so that\r\nwhen the facts which he desired to cite had undergone no change, he very\r\nseldom found any to make in his language. Nevertheless, here and there,\r\nsome small modification, a slight verbal difference, a trifling\r\nalteration in the order of a sentence, the insertion of a short clause\r\nto secure greater perspicuity, shows to how careful and close a revision\r\nthe whole had been subjected. In the substance of the work, besides the\r\nexcision of nearly one-third of the material and the complete\r\nreconstruction of the part relating to the antiquity of man and the\r\norigin of species, already mentioned, the following are the most\r\nimportant changes. The chapters which discuss the evidence in favour of\r\npast mutations of climate and the causes to which these are due, are\r\nrewritten and greatly enlarged. In the earlier editions, the effects of\r\ngeographical changes were regarded as sufficient to account for all the\r\nclimatal variations that geology requires; in the later editions, the\r\npossible co-operation of astronomical changes is admitted. Great\r\nadditions also are made to the parts referring to the condition of the\r\nbed of the ocean, and much new and important information is incorporated\r\ninto the sections dealing with volcanoes and earthquakes; including many\r\nvaluable observations which had been made during visits to Vesuvius and\r\nto Etna in the autumns of 1857 and 1858. The section on the action of\r\nice is so altered and enlarged as to be practically new; for when the\r\nfirst edition of the \"Principles\" was published comparatively little was\r\nknown of the effects of land-ice, and the art of following the trail of\r\nvanished glaciers had yet to be learnt. But, with this exception, the\r\npart of the book dealing with the action of the forces of Nature--heat\r\nand cold, rain, rivers, and sea--remains comparatively unaltered, as do\r\nthe first five chapters, which give a sketch of the early history of the\r\nscience of geology.\r\n\r\nWithout some knowledge of this history it is hardly possible to\r\nappreciate the true greatness of the \"Principles,\" and its unique value\r\nas an influence on scientific thought at the time it appeared. This,\r\nhowever, to some extent may be inferred from those chapters which we\r\nhave mentioned; but the perspective of half a century enables us to\r\nunderstand it better at the present time; for the author, of course, had\r\nto deal with contemporary work and opinion only in a very indirect way.\r\nWe may dismiss briefly the crude speculations of the earliest\r\nobservers--those anterior to the Christian era--of which the author\r\ngives a summary in the second chapter of the \"Principles\"; for at that\r\nearly date few persons had made any effort to arrange the facts of\r\nNature in a connected system. These were too scanty and too disconnected\r\nfor any such effort to be successful. The general result cannot be\r\nbetter summed up than in Lyell's own words:--\r\n\r\n      \"Although no particular investigations had been made for the\r\n      express purpose of interpreting the monuments of ancient\r\n      changes, they were too obvious to be entirely disregarded;\r\n      and the observation of the present course of Nature\r\n      presented too many proofs of alterations continually in\r\n      progress on the earth to allow philosophers to believe that\r\n      Nature was in a state of rest, or that the surface had\r\n      remained and would continue to remain, unaltered. But they\r\n      had never compared attentively the results of the destroying\r\n      and the reproductive operations of modern times with those\r\n      of remote eras; nor had they ever entertained so much as a\r\n      conjecture concerning the comparative antiquity of the human\r\n      race, or of living species of animals and plants, with those\r\n      belonging to former conditions of the organic world. They\r\n      had studied the movements and positions of the heavenly\r\n      bodies with laborious industry, and made some progress in\r\n      investigating the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms;\r\n      but the ancient history of the globe was to them a sealed\r\n      book, and though written in characters of the most striking\r\n      and imposing kind, they were unconscious even of its\r\n      existence.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThe above remarks hold good for the centuries immediately succeeding the\r\nChristian era; and the influence of the new faith, when it ceased to be\r\npersecuted and became a power in the state, was adverse on the whole to\r\nprogress in physical or natural science. With the decline of the Roman\r\nempire a great darkness fell upon the civilised world; art, science,\r\nliterature withered before the hot breath of war and rapine, as the\r\nnorthern barbarians swept down upon their enfeebled master on their\r\nerrand of destruction. It was well nigh eight centuries from the\r\nChristian era before the spirit of scientific enquiry and the love of\r\nliterature began to awaken from their long torpor; and it was then among\r\npeople of an Eastern race and an alien creed. The caliphs of Bagdad\r\nencouraged learning, and the students of the East became familiar by\r\nmeans of translations with the thoughts and questionings of ancient\r\nGreece and Rome. The efforts of their earliest investigators have not\r\nbeen preserved, but in treatises of the tenth century--written by one\r\nAvicenna, a court physician, the \"Formation and Classification of\r\nMinerals\" is discussed, as well as the \"Cause of Mountains.\" In the\r\nlatter attention is called to the effect of earthquakes, and to the\r\nexcavatory action of streams. In the same century also, \"Omar the\r\nLearned\" wrote a book on \"the retreat of the sea,\" in which he proved by\r\nreference to ancient charts and by other less direct arguments that\r\nchanges of importance had occurred in the form of the coast of Asia. But\r\neven among the followers of Mohammed theology declared itself hostile to\r\nscience; the Moslem doctors of divinity deemed the pages of the Koran,\r\nnot the book of Nature, man's proper sphere of research, and considered\r\nthese difficulties ought to be settled by a quotation from the one\r\nrather than by facts from the other. So progress in science was impeded,\r\nand recantations at the bidding of ecclesiastics are not restricted to\r\nthe annals of Christian races. But men seem to have gone on speculating,\r\nand Mohammed Kazwini, in a striking allegory which is quoted by Lyell,\r\ntells his readers how (to use the words of Tennyson)[57]:--\r\n\r\n    \"There rolls the deep where grew the tree.\r\n      O Earth, what changes thou hast seen!\r\n      There, where the long street roars, hath been\r\n    The stillness of the central sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn Europe geological phenomena do not appear to have attracted serious\r\nattention till the sixteenth century, when the significance of fossils\r\nbecame the subject of an animated controversy in Italy. At that epoch\r\nthis country held the front rank in learning and the arts, and an\r\ninquiry of that nature arose almost as a matter of course, because the\r\nmarls, sands, and soft limestones of its lower districts teem in many\r\nplaces with shells and other marine organisms in a singular state of\r\nperfection and preservation. It is interesting to remark, that among the\r\nforemost in appealing to inductive processes for the explanation of\r\nthese enigmas was that extraordinary and almost universal genius,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci. He ridiculed the current idea that these shells were\r\nformed \"by the influence of the stars,\" calling attention to the mud by\r\nwhich they were filled, and the gravel beds among which they were\r\nintercalated, as proof that they had once lain upon the bed of the sea\r\nat no great distance from the coast. His induction rested on the\r\nevidence of sections which had been exposed during his construction of\r\ncertain navigable canals in the north of Italy. Shortly afterward, the\r\nconclusions of Leonardo were amplified, and strengthened on similar\r\ngrounds by Frascatoro. He, however, not only demonstrated the absurdity\r\nof explaining these organic structures by the \"plastic force of\r\nNature\"--a favourite refuge for the intellectually destitute of that and\r\neven a later age, but he also showed that they could not even be relics\r\nof the Noachian deluge. \"That inundation, he observed, was too\r\ntransient; it had consisted principally of fluviatile waters; and if it\r\nhad transported shells to great distances, must have strewed them over\r\nthe surface, not buried them at vast depths in the interior of\r\nmountains.\" As Lyell truly remarks, \"His clear exposition of the\r\nevidence would have terminated the discussion for ever, if the passions\r\nof man had not been enlisted in the dispute; and even though doubts\r\nshould for a time have remained in some minds, they would speedily have\r\nbeen removed by the fresh information obtained almost immediately\r\nafterwards, respecting the structure of fossil remains, and of their\r\nliving analogues.\" But the difficulties raised by theologians, and the\r\ngeneral preference for deductive over inductive reasoning, greatly\r\nimpeded progress. It was not till the methods of the schoolmen yielded\r\nplace to those of the natural philosophers that the tide of battle began\r\nto turn, and science to possess the domains from which she had been\r\nunjustly excluded. For about a century the weary war went on; the\r\nphilosophers of Italy leading the van, those of England, it must be\r\nadmitted, for long lagging behind them, before the spectre of \"plastic\r\nforce\" was finally dismissed to the limbo of exploded hypotheses in\r\nEngland. For instance, it was seriously maintained by the well-known\r\nwriter on county history, Dr. Plot, in the last quarter of the\r\nseventeenth century, though its absurdity had been demonstrated by his\r\nItalian contemporaries; as by Scilla, in his treatise on the fossils of\r\nCalabria, and by Steno, in that on \"Gems, crystals, and organic\r\npetrifactions enclosed in solid rocks.\" The latter had proved by\r\ndissecting a shark recently captured in the Mediterranean, that its\r\nteeth and bones corresponded exactly with similar objects from a fossil\r\nin Tuscany, and that the shells discovered in sundry Italian strata were\r\nidentical with living species, except for the loss of their animal\r\ngluten and some slight mineral change. Moreover, he had distinguished,\r\nby means of their organic remains, between deposits of a marine and of a\r\nfluviatile character.\r\n\r\nBut now, as the \"plastic force\" dogma lost its hold on the minds of men,\r\nits place was taken by that which regarded all fossils as the relics of\r\nan universal deluge.\r\n\r\n      \"The theologians who now entered the field in Italy,\r\n      Germany, France, and England, were innumerable; and\r\n      henceforward, they who refused to subscribe to the position\r\n      that all marine organic remains were proofs of the Mosaic\r\n      deluge, were exposed to the imputation of disbelieving the\r\n      whole of the sacred writings. Scarce any step had been made\r\n      in approximating to sound theories since the time of\r\n      Frascatoro, more than a hundred years having been lost in\r\n      writing down the dogma that organised fossils were mere\r\n      sports of Nature. An additional period of a century and a\r\n      half was now destined to be consumed in exploding the\r\n      hypothesis that organised fossils had all been buried in the\r\n      solid strata by Noah's flood.\"[58]\r\n\r\nInto the varying fortunes of this second struggle it is needless to\r\nenter at any length. It was the old conflict between theology and\r\nscience in a yet more acute form; the old warfare between deductive and\r\ninductive reasoning; between dogmatic ignorance and an honest search for\r\ntruth. Protestants and Romanists alike seemed to claim the gift of\r\ninfallibility, with the right to decide _ex cathedra_ on questions of\r\nwhich they were profoundly ignorant, and to pronounce sentence in causes\r\nwhere they could not even appreciate the evidence. Ecclesiastics\r\nscolded; well-meaning though incompetent laymen echoed their cry; the\r\nmore timorous among scientific men wasted their time in devising\r\nelaborate but futile schemes of accommodation between the discoveries of\r\ngeology and the supposed revelations of the Scriptures; the stronger\r\nlaboured on patiently, gathering evidence, strengthening their arguments\r\nand dissecting the fallacies by which they were assailed, until the\r\npopular prejudice should be allayed and men be calm enough to listen to\r\nthe voice of truth. It was a long and weary struggle, which is now\r\nnearly, though not quite, ended; for there are still a few who mistake\r\nfor an impregnable rock that which is merely the shifting-sand of\r\npopular opinion, and cannot realise that the province of revelation is\r\nin the spiritual rather than in the material, in the moral rather than\r\nin the scientific order. The outbursts of denunciation aroused by the\r\nassertion of the antiquity of man and the publication of the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" which many still in the full vigour of their powers can well\r\nremember, were but a recrudescence of the same spirit, a reappearance of\r\nan old foe with a new face.\r\n\r\nBut when Lyell was young and the idea of the \"Principles\" began to\r\ngerminate in his mind, popular prejudice against the free exercise of\r\ninquiry in geology was still strong; this diluvial hypothesis still\r\nhampered, if it did not fully satisfy, the majority of scientific\r\nworkers. Here and there, it is true, some isolated pioneer demonstrated\r\nthe impossibility of referring the fossil contents of the earth's crust\r\nto a single deluge, or protested against the singular mixture of actual\r\nobservation, patristic quotation, and deductive reasoning which commonly\r\npassed current for geological science. Chief and earliest among these\r\nmen, Vallisneri, also an Italian, about a century before Lyell's birth,\r\nwas clearsighted enough to see \"how much the interests of religion as\r\nwell as those of sound philosophy had suffered by perpetually mixing up\r\nthe sacred writings with questions in physical science\"; indeed, he was\r\nso far advanced as to attempt a general sketch of the marine deposits of\r\nItaly, with their organic remains, and to arrive at the conclusion that\r\nthe ocean formerly had extended over the whole earth and after\r\nremaining there for a long time had gradually subsided. This conclusion,\r\nthough inadequate as an expression of the truth, was much more\r\nphilosophical than that of an universal and comparatively recent deluge.\r\nMoro and Generelli, in the same country, followed the lead of\r\nVallisneri, in seeking for hypotheses which were consistent with the\r\nfacts of Nature, Generelli even arriving at conclusions which, in\r\neffect, were those adopted by Lyell, and have been thus translated by\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n      \"Is it possible that this waste should have continued for\r\n      six thousand and perhaps a greater number of years, and that\r\n      the mountains should remain so great unless their ruins have\r\n      been repaired? Is it credible that the Author of Nature\r\n      should have founded the world upon such laws as that the dry\r\n      land should be for ever growing smaller, and at last become\r\n      wholly submerged beneath the waters? Is it credible that,\r\n      amid so many created things, the mountains alone should\r\n      daily diminish in number and bulk, without there being any\r\n      repair of their losses? This would be contrary to that order\r\n      of Providence which is seen to reign in all other things in\r\n      the universe. Wherefore I deem it just to conclude that the\r\n      same cause which, in the beginning of time, raised mountains\r\n      from the abyss, has down to the present day continued to\r\n      produce others, in order to restore from time to time, the\r\n      losses of all such as sink down in different places, or are\r\n      rent asunder, or in other ways suffer disintegration. If\r\n      this be admitted, we can easily understand why there should\r\n      now be found upon many mountains so great a number of\r\n      crustacea and other marine animals.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt at a system of rational geology was a great advance in the\r\nright direction, though many gaps still remained to be filled up and\r\nsome errors to be corrected; such for instance as the idea adopted by\r\nGenerelli from Moro, and maintained in other parts of his work, that\r\nall the stratified rocks are derived from volcanic ejections.\r\nNevertheless, geology, by the middle of the eighteenth century, had\r\nevidently begun to pass gradually, though very slowly, from the stage of\r\ncrude and fanciful hypotheses to that of an inductive science. But even\r\nthen the observers had only succeeded in setting foot on the lower\r\nslopes of a peak, the summit of which will not be reached, if indeed it\r\never be, for many a long year to come. During the next half of the\r\ncentury progress was made, now in this direction, now in that; slowly\r\ntruths were established, slowly errors dispelled; and as the close of\r\nthat century approached, the foundations of modern geology began to be\r\nsecurely laid. A great impulse was given to the work, though to some\r\nextent the apparent help proved to be a real hindrance, by that famous\r\nteacher, Werner of Freiberg, in Saxony. His influence was highly\r\nbeneficial, because he insisted not only on a careful study of the\r\nmineral character of rocks, but also on attending to their grouping,\r\ngeographical distribution, and general relations. It was hurtful almost\r\nto as great a degree, because he maintained, and succeeded by his\r\nenthusiasm and eloquence in impressing on his disciples, most erroneous\r\nnotions as to the origin of basalts and those other igneous rocks which\r\nwere formerly comprehended under the name \"trap.\" Such rocks he stoutly\r\nasserted to be chemical precipitates from water, and, besides this, he\r\nheld views in general strongly opposed to anything like the action of\r\nuniform causes in the earth's history. In short, the Saxon Professor was\r\nin many respects the exact antithesis of Lyell, and the points of\r\nessential contrast cannot be better indicated than in the words of the\r\nlatter.[59]\r\n\r\n      \"If it be true that delivery be the first, second, and third\r\n      requisite in a popular orator, it is no less certain that to\r\n      travel is of first, second, and third importance to those\r\n      who desire to originate just and comprehensive views\r\n      concerning the structure of our globe. Now Werner had not\r\n      travelled to distant countries; he had merely explored a\r\n      small portion of Germany, and conceived, and persuaded\r\n      others to believe, that the whole surface of our planet and\r\n      all the mountain-chains in the world were made after the\r\n      model of his own province. It became a ruling object of\r\n      ambition in the minds of his pupils to confirm the\r\n      generalisations of their great master, and to discover in\r\n      the most distant parts of the globe his 'universal\r\n      formations,' which he supposed had been each in succession\r\n      simultaneously precipitated over the whole earth from a\r\n      common menstruum or chaotic fluid.\"\r\n\r\nThese wild generalisations, as Lyell points out, had not even the merit\r\nof being really in accordance with the evidence afforded by some parts\r\nof Saxony itself. Werner, in fact, was a conspicuous example of a\r\ntendency, which perhaps even now is not quite extinct, to work too much\r\nbeneath a roof and too little in the open air; to found great\r\ngeneralisations on the minute results of research in a laboratory,\r\nwithout subjecting them to actual tests by the study of rocks in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThis error on Werner's part was the less excusable, because, even before\r\nhe began to lecture, the true nature of basalts and traps generally had\r\nbeen recognised by several observers of different nationalities. In the\r\nHebrides and in Iceland, in the Vicentin and in Auvergne, even in Hesse\r\nand in the Rheingau, proof after proof had been cited, and the evidence\r\nin favour of the \"igneous\" origin of these rocks had become\r\nirresistible, as one might suppose, within some half dozen years of\r\nWerner's appointment as professor at Freiberg. Faujas, in 1779,\r\npublished a description of the volcanoes of the Vivarais and Velay, in\r\nwhich he showed how the streams of basalt had poured out from craters\r\nwhich still remain in a perfect state. Desmarest also pointed out that\r\nin Auvergne \"first came the most recent volcanoes, which had their\r\ncraters still entire and their streams of lava conforming to the level\r\nof the present river courses. He then showed that there were others of\r\nan intermediate epoch, whose craters were nearly effaced, and whose\r\nlavas were less intimately connected with the present valleys; and\r\nlastly, that there were volcanic rocks still more ancient without any\r\ndiscernible craters or scoriae, and bearing the closest analogy to rocks\r\nin other parts of Europe, the igneous origin of which was denied by the\r\nschool of Freiberg.\" Desmarest even constructed and published a\r\ngeological map of Auvergne, of which Lyell speaks in terms of high\r\ncommendation. \"They alone who have carefully studied Auvergne, and\r\ntraced the different lava streams from their craters to their\r\ntermination--the various isolated basaltic cappings--the relation of\r\nsome lavas to the present valleys--the absence of such relations in\r\nothers--can appreciate the extraordinary fidelity of this elaborate\r\nwork.\"[60]\r\n\r\nBut before the close of the eighteenth century, two champions had\r\nalready stepped into the arena to withstand the Wernerian hypothesis,\r\nwhich, like a swelling tide, was spreading over Europe, and threatening\r\nto sweep away everything before it. These were James Hutton and William\r\nSmith; the one born north, the other south of the Tweed. From the name\r\nof the former that of his friend and expositor, John Playfair, must\r\nnever be separated. They were the Socrates and the Plato of that school\r\nof thought from which modern geology has been developed.[61] To quote\r\nthe eloquent words of Sir Archibald Geikie[62]:--\r\n\r\n      \"On looking back to the beginning of this century we see the\r\n      geologists of Britain divided into two hostile camps, which\r\n      waged against each other a keen and even an embittered\r\n      warfare. On the one hand were the followers of Hutton of\r\n      Edinburgh, called from him the Vulcanists, or Plutonists; on\r\n      the other, the disciples of Werner ... who went by the name\r\n      of Wernerians, or Neptunists.... The Huttonians, who adhered\r\n      to the principles laid down by their great founder,\r\n      maintained, as their fundamental doctrine, that the past\r\n      history of our planet is to be explained by what we can\r\n      learn of the economy of Nature at the present time. Unlike\r\n      the cosmogonists, they did not trouble themselves with what\r\n      was the first condition of the earth, nor try to trace every\r\n      subsequent phase of its history. They held that the\r\n      geological record does not go back to the beginning, and\r\n      that therefore any attempt to trace that beginning from\r\n      geological evidence was vain. Most strongly, too, did they\r\n      protest against the introduction of causes which could not\r\n      be shown to be a part of the present economy. They never\r\n      wearied of insisting that to the everyday workings of air,\r\n      earth, and sea, must be our appeal for an explanation of the\r\n      older revolutions of the globe. The fall of rain, the flow\r\n      of rivers, the slowly crumbling decay of mountain, valley,\r\n      and shore, were one by one summoned as witnesses to bear\r\n      testimony to the manner in which the most stupendous\r\n      geological changes are slowly and silently brought about.\r\n      The waste of the land, which they traced everywhere, was\r\n      found to give birth to soil--renovation of the surface thus\r\n      springing Phoenix-like out of its decay. In the descent of\r\n      water from the clouds to the mountains, and from the\r\n      mountains to the sea, they recognised the power by which\r\n      valleys are carved out of the land, and by which also the\r\n      materials worn from the land are carried out to the sea,\r\n      there to be gathered into solid stone--the framework of new\r\n      continents. In the rocks of the hills and valleys they\r\n      recognised abundantly the traces of old sea-bottoms. They\r\n      stoutly maintained that these old sea-bottoms had been\r\n      raised up into dry land from time to time by the powerful\r\n      action of the same internal heat to which volcanoes owe\r\n      their birth, and they pointed to the way in which granite\r\n      and other crystalline rocks occur as convincing evidence of\r\n      the extent to which the solid earth has been altered and\r\n      upheaved by the action of these subterranean fires.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the leading principles of the \"Huttonian theory,\" though\r\nperhaps they are stated here in a slightly more developed form than when\r\nit was first presented by its illustrious author. But it was defective\r\nin one important respect, on a side from which it might have obtained\r\nthe strongest support, and have liberated itself from the bondage of\r\ndeluges; in other words, of convulsive action, by which it was still\r\nfettered, for \"it took no account of the fossil remains of plants and\r\nanimals. Hence it ignored the long succession of life upon the earth\r\nwhich those remains have since made known, as well as the evidence\r\nthereby obtainable as to the nature and order of physical changes, such\r\nas alternations of sea and land, revolutions of climate, and suchlike.\"\r\n\r\nThis defect was supplied by William Smith. He had learnt, by patient\r\nlabour among the stratified rocks of England, to recognise their\r\nfossils, had ascertained that certain assemblages of the latter\r\ncharacterised each group of strata, and by this means had traced such\r\ngroups through the country, and had placed them in order of\r\nsuperposition. So early as 1790, he published a \"Tabular View of the\r\nBritish Strata,\" and from that time was engaged at every spare moment in\r\nconstructing a geological map of England, all the while freely\r\ncommunicating the results of his researches to his brethren of the\r\nhammer. \"The execution of his map was completed in 1815, and it remains\r\na lasting monument of original talent and extraordinary perseverance;\r\nfor he had explored the whole country on foot without the guidance of\r\nprevious observers, or the aid of fellow labourers, and had succeeded in\r\nthrowing into natural divisions the whole complicated series of British\r\nrocks.\"[63]\r\n\r\nA most important step in view of future progress, at any rate in our own\r\ncountry, was taken by the foundation of the Geological Society of London\r\nin 1807, the members of which devoted themselves at first rather to the\r\ncollection of facts than to the construction of theories, while in\r\nFrance the labours of Brongniart and Cuvier in comparative osteology,\r\nand of Lamarck in recent and fossil shells, smoothed the way toward the\r\ndownfall of catastrophic geology. Those men, with their disciples,\r\n\"raised these departments of study to a rank of which they had never\r\nbefore been deemed susceptible. Their investigations had eventually a\r\npowerful effect in dispelling the illusion which had long prevailed\r\nconcerning the absence of analogy between the ancient and modern state\r\nof our planet. A close comparison of the recent and fossil species, and\r\nthe inferences drawn in regard to their habits, accustomed the geologist\r\nto contemplate the earth as having been at successive periods the\r\ndwelling-place of animals and plants of different races--some\r\nterrestrial, and others aquatic; some fitted to live in seas, others in\r\nthe waters of lakes and rivers. By the consideration of these topics the\r\nmind was slowly and insensibly withdrawn from imaginary pictures of\r\ncatastrophes and chaotic confusion, such as haunted the imagination of\r\nthe early cosmogonists. Numerous proofs were discovered of the tranquil\r\ndeposition of sedimentary matter, and the slow development of organic\r\nlife.\"[64]\r\n\r\nSuch was the earlier history of Geology; such were the influences which\r\nhad moulded its ideas till within a few years of the date when Lyell\r\nbegan to make it a subject of serious study. At that time, namely about\r\nthe year 1820, the Geological Society of London had become the centre\r\nand meeting-point of a band of earnest and enthusiastic workers, whose\r\nnames will always hold an honoured place in the annals of the Science.\r\nAmong the older members--most of whom, however, were still in the prime\r\nof life, were such men as Buckland, Conybeare, Fitton, Greenough,\r\nHorner, MacCulloch, Warburton and Wollaston; among the younger, De la\r\nBeche and Scrope, Sedgwick and Whewell. Murchison, though a few years\r\nLyell's senior, was by almost as many his junior as a geologist, for he\r\ndid not join the Society till the end of 1824, and was actually admitted\r\non the evening when Lyell, then one of its honorary secretaries, read\r\nhis first paper--on the marl-lake at Kinnordy. Such men also as\r\nBabbage, Herschel, Warburton, Sir Philip Egerton, the Earl of\r\nEnniskillen (then Viscount Cole), must not be forgotten, who were either\r\nless frequent visitors or more directly devoted to other studies. At\r\nthis time geology was passing into a phase which endured for some forty\r\nyears--the exaltation of the palaeontological, the depreciation of the\r\nmineralogical side. If it be true, as it has been more than once\r\nremarked, that the father of the geologist was a mineralogist, it is no\r\nless true that his mother was a palaeontologist; but at this particular\r\nepoch the paternal influence obviously declined, while that of the\r\nmother became inordinately strong. Wollaston and MacCulloch, indeed,\r\nwere geologists of the old school; excellent mineralogists and\r\npetrologists (to use the more modern term) as accurate as it was\r\npossible to be with the appliances at their disposal, but among the\r\nyounger men De la Beche, accompanied to a certain extent by Scrope and\r\nSedgwick, was almost alone in following their lead. But although\r\npalaeontology and stratigraphical geology as its associate were clearly\r\nmaking progress, the school of thought, of which Lyell became the\r\nchampion, counted at this time but few adherents, for the older\r\ngeologists were almost to a man \"catastrophists.\" A few, like\r\nMacCulloch, undervalued palaeontological research, and thus were doubly\r\nprejudiced against the uniformitarian views. Buckland, Conybeare,\r\nGreenough, as we have already seen from incidental remarks in Lyell's\r\nletters, had put their trust in deluges, and imagined that by such an\r\nagency the earth had been prepared for a new creation of living things\r\nand a new group of geological formations. Sedgwick even was to a great\r\nextent on their side. He had speedily emerged from the waters of\r\nWernerism, in which at first he had been for a short time immersed, but\r\nhe did not escape so easily from the roaring floods of diluvialists, and\r\nthe grandeur of catastrophic changes in the crust of the earth\r\nfascinated his enthusiastic, almost poetic, nature. Even so late as\r\n1830, we find him criticising from the chair of the Geological Society\r\nthe leading argument of Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" in no friendly\r\nspirit, and bestowing high praise on Elie de Beaumont's theory of\r\nParallel Mountain-chains.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the views advocated by this eminent French geologist\r\nmay serve to indicate, perhaps better than any general statements, the\r\ninfluences against which Lyell had to contend at the outset of his\r\ncareer as a geologist. With the omission of certain parts, to which no\r\nexception would be taken, or which have no very direct bearing upon the\r\nimmediate question, they are as follows[65]: (1) In the history of the\r\nearth there have been long periods of comparative repose, during which\r\nthe sedimentary strata have been continuously deposited, and short\r\nperiods of paroxysmal violence, during which that continuity has been\r\ninterrupted. (2) At each of these periods of violence or revolution in\r\nthe state of the earth's surface, a great number of mountain-chains have\r\nbeen formed suddenly, and these chains, if contemporaneous, are\r\nparallel; but if not so, generally differ in direction. (3) Each\r\nrevolution or great convulsion has coincided with the date of another\r\ngeological phenomenon, namely, the passage from one independent\r\nsedimentary formation to another, characterised by a considerable\r\ndifference in \"organic types.\" (4) There has been a recurrence of these\r\nparoxysmal movements from the remotest geological periods; and they may\r\nstill be produced.\r\n\r\nThus the force of authority, which has to be reckoned with in geology,\r\nif not in other branches of science, was in the main adverse to Lyell,\r\nwho could count on but few to join him in his attack on catastrophism.\r\nOne indeed there was, a host in himself, who, though his contemporary in\r\nyears, had devoted himself wholly to geology at a slightly earlier date\r\nand had already become convinced, by his field-work in Italy and France,\r\nof the efficacy of existing forces to work mighty changes, if time were\r\ngiven, in the configuration of the earth's surface. This was George\r\nPoulett Scrope, a man of broad culture, great talents, and singular\r\nindependence of thought, who had convinced himself of the errors of the\r\nWernerian theory by his studies in Italy in the years 1817-19, and had\r\nthoroughly explored the volcanic district of Auvergne in 1821. His work\r\non the Phenomena of Volcanoes, published in 1823, and that on the\r\nGeology of Central France, published in 1826, had given the _coup de\r\ngrace_ to Werner's hypothesis and had made the first breach in the\r\nfortress of the catastrophists.\r\n\r\nFor a complete solution of the problem to which Lyell had addressed\r\nhimself, two methods of investigation were necessary. It must be\r\ndemonstrated that in tracing back the life history of the earth from the\r\npresent age to a comparatively remote past no breach of continuity\r\ncould be detected, and that the forces which were still engaged in\r\nsculpturing and modifying this earth's surface were adequate, given time\r\nenough, to produce all those changes to which the catastrophist appealed\r\nas proofs of his hypotheses. To establish the one conclusion, it was\r\nnecessary to make a careful study of the Tertiary formations, which were\r\nstill in a condition of comparative confusion; to arrange them in an\r\norder no less clear and definite than that of the Secondary systems; and\r\nto show, by working downward from the present fauna, not only that many\r\nliving species had been long in existence, but also that these had\r\nappeared gradually, not simultaneously, and had in like manner replaced\r\nforms which had one after another vanished--to prove, in short, \"that\r\npast and present are bound together by an unsevered cord of life, whose\r\ninterlacing strands carry us back in orderly change from age to age.\" To\r\nestablish the other conclusion it was necessary to show that, even in\r\nhistorical times, considerable changes had occurred in the outlines of\r\ncoasts, and that heat and cold, the sea, or rain and rivers--especially\r\nthe last--had been agents of the utmost importance in the sculpture of\r\ncliffs, valleys, and hills. For both these purposes careful study, not\r\nonly in Britain, but also still more in other regions, was absolutely\r\nnecessary, and it was with them in view that Lyell undertook his\r\njourneys, from the time when his geological ideas began to assume a\r\ndefinite shape until the last volume of the \"Principles\" was published.\r\nBy that date, as has been stated in the preceding chapters, he had made\r\nhimself familiar in the course of his geological education with many\r\nparts of Britain, had laboriously investigated the more important\r\ncollections and museums of France and Italy, and had carefully studied\r\nin the field the principal Tertiary deposits not only in these countries\r\nbut also in Sicily and in parts of Switzerland and Germany. To obtain\r\nevidence bearing on the physical aspect of the question on a scale\r\ngrander than was afforded by the undulating lowlands, or worn-down\r\nhighland regions of Britain and the neighbouring parts of Europe, he had\r\nrambled among the Alps and Pyrenees, examining their peaks and\r\nprecipices, their snowfields, glaciers, lakes, and torrents, and\r\nwatching the processes of destruction, transportation, and deposition of\r\nwhich crag, stream, and plain afford a never-ending object-lesson. In\r\norder to study volcanoes still in activity, he had climbed Vesuvius and\r\nEtna; in order to scrutinise more minutely the structure of cones,\r\ncraters, and lava streams, he had visited Auvergne, Catalonia, and the\r\nEifel; while in all his goings and comings through scenes where Nature\r\nworked more unobtrusively, he had watched her never-ending toil, as she\r\ndestroyed with the one hand and built with the other. He was thus able\r\nto write with the authority of one who has seen, not of one who merely\r\nquotes; of one who knew, not of one who had learnt by rote. The\r\n\"Principles of Geology,\" though of course it had to rely not seldom on\r\nthe work of others, bore the stamp of the author's experience, and was\r\nredolent, not of the dust of libraries, but of the sweetness of the open\r\nair. That fact added no little force to its cautious and clear inductive\r\nreasoning; that fact did much to disarm opposition, and to open the way\r\nto victory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] Strictly speaking, fifteen out of the last sixteen chapters, for\r\nthe final one (dealing with coral reefs) is substantially a reprint.\r\n\r\n[56] \"Principles of Geology,\" vol. i. p. 26 (eleventh edition).\r\n\r\n[57] _In Memoriam_, cxxiii.\r\n\r\n[58] \"Principles of Geology,\" chap. iii. p. 37.\r\n\r\n[59] \"Principles of Geology,\" chap. iv.\r\n\r\n[60] \"Principles of Geology,\" chap. iv.\r\n\r\n[61] Hutton's \"Theory of the Earth\" was first published in 1788, and in\r\nan enlarged form in 1795.

During their first halt, at\r\nParis, she was duly introduced to the famous quarries of Montmartre, and\r\nhad an opportunity of \"collecting a fossil shell or two for the first\r\ntime.\" Thence they made their way to Bonn, which she had left as a bride\r\nthe previous summer, and, after another short halt, proceeded up the\r\ngorge of the Rhine to Bingen, visiting on the way the ironworks at Sayn,\r\nand examining the stratified volcanic deposits on the plain between the\r\nriver and that town. The Tertiary basin at Mayence was next visited, and\r\nfrom it they went leisurely to Heidelberg. From the picturesque old town\r\nby the Neckar they struck off to Stuttgart and to Pappenheim, examining\r\none or two collections at the former place, and the quarries of\r\nSolenhofen, near the latter. These were already noted for the abundant\r\nand well-preserved fossils obtained in the quarries worked for the\r\nwell-known \"lithographic stone,\" though the famous Archaeopteryx had yet\r\nto be found; that strange creature, feathered and like a bird, but with\r\nteeth in its beak and a tail like a reptile, which has supplied such an\r\nimportant link in the chain of evidence in favour of progressive\r\ndevelopment. Thence they travelled to Nuernberg and Bayreuth, visiting\r\non their way the noted caves at Muggendorf, and returned to Bonn by way\r\nof Bamberg, Wuertzburg, Aschaffenberg, and Frankfurt. In this journey,\r\nfew localities of special interest were investigated, but, as Lyell's\r\nletters show, no opportunity was lost of discussing important questions\r\nwith local geologists, or of examining sections in the field. But on the\r\nway back to England through Belgium a halt was made at Liege, to inspect\r\nDr. Schmerling's grand collection of cave-remains. It is evident, though\r\nbut a short notice of it has been preserved, that this visit kindled an\r\nenthusiasm which was to produce important results in later years. Lyell\r\nwrites (to Mantell, after his return to England):--\r\n\r\n      \"I saw at Liege the collection of Dr. Schmerling, who in\r\n      three years has, by his own exertion and the incessant\r\n      labours of a clever amateur servant, cleared out some twenty\r\n      caves untouched by any previous searcher, and has filled a\r\n      truly splendid museum. He numbers already thrice the number\r\n      of fossil cavern mammalia known when Buckland wrote his\r\n      'Idola Specus'; and such is the prodigious number of the\r\n      individuals of some species--the bears, for example, of\r\n      which he has five species, one large, one new--that several\r\n      entire skeletons will be constructed. Oh, that the Lewes\r\n      chalk had been cavernous! And he has these, and a number of\r\n      yet unexplored and shortly to be investigated holes, all to\r\n      himself: but envy him not--you cannot imagine what he feels\r\n      at being far from a metropolis which can afford him\r\n      sympathy; and having not one congenial soul at Liege, and\r\n      none who take any interest in his discoveries save the\r\n      priests--and what kind _they_ take you may guess, more\r\n      especially as he has found human remains in breccia,\r\n      embedded with the extinct species, under circumstances far\r\n      more difficult to get over than any I have previously heard\r\n      of. The _three_ coats or layers of stalagmite cited by me at\r\n      Choquier are quite true.\"[67]\r\n\r\nVery probably among these human relics was one which was destined to\r\nbecome famous--the skull found in the cave at Engis--for this was\r\ndescribed by Dr. Schmerling in his \"Recherches sur les ossements\r\nfossiles decouverts dans les cavernes de la Province de Liege,\" a book\r\npublished in 1833. It was found at a depth of nearly five feet, hidden\r\nunder an osseous breccia, composed of the remains of small animals, and\r\ncontaining one rhinoceros tusk with several teeth of horses and of\r\nruminants. The earth in which it was lying did not show the slightest\r\ntrace of disturbance, and teeth of rhinoceros, horse, hyaena, and bear\r\nsurrounded it on all sides.[68] This relic proved--and since then\r\nnumbers of similar cases have been discovered--that if the man of Engis\r\nwere an antediluvian, and his corpse had been washed into the cave\r\ntogether with the drowned bodies of rhinoceros, and other animals,[69]\r\nthat event, at any rate, must have corresponded with a great change in\r\nthe habits of the larger mammalia, for they had been unable to return to\r\nhaunts which once had been congenial. In other words, the foundation was\r\nbeing laid, now in 1833, for the next great advance in geological\r\nscience, the contemporaneity of man and several extinct species of\r\nmammals, indicating, of course, the antiquity of the human race. To this\r\npoint, however, public attention was not directed for nearly twenty\r\nyears. Then various causes, especially an examination into the evidence\r\ndiscovered in the neighbourhood of Abbeville and Amiens by M. Boucher\r\nde Perthes, brought the question to the front. But though the\r\ncontroversy was sharp and bitter for a time, it was speedily over, and\r\nthe question which is still agitated--though mildly and in a sense\r\nwholly scientific--is whether man appeared in this part of Europe and in\r\ncorresponding regions of North America, before, during, or after the\r\nglacial epoch?\r\n\r\nBut the Engis skull is a relic exceptionally interesting. Though the\r\nhandiwork of primaeval man is common enough--rudely chipped instruments\r\nor weapons of flint or other stone, worked portions of bones and\r\nantlers, and such like--yet his bones are far less common than those of\r\nother mammals, and, most of all, skulls are rare. Professor Huxley, in\r\nhis work from which we have already quoted, states that Dr. Schmerling\r\nfound a bone implement in the Engis cave, and worked flints in all the\r\nossiferous Belgian caves, yet this was the only skull in anything like a\r\nperfect condition, though another cavern furnished two fragments of\r\nparietal bones. Yet from the latter numerous bones of the extremities\r\nwere obtained, and these had belonged to three individuals. What\r\ninferences, then, can be drawn from this skull as to the intellectual\r\nrank of primaeval man? This question was discussed by its discoverer, and\r\nthe evidence has been also considered by Professor Huxley. The former\r\nthus expressed his opinion, \"that this cranium has belonged to a person\r\nof limited intellectual faculties, and we conclude thence that it\r\nbelonged to a man of a low degree of civilisation; a deduction which is\r\nborne out by contrasting the capacity of the frontal with that of the\r\noccipital region.\" Professor Huxley sums up a careful discussion of the\r\nevidence, in which he calls special attention to points where it happens\r\nto be defective, by stating that the specimen agrees in certain respects\r\nwith Australian skulls, in others with some European, but that he can\r\nfind in the remains no character which, if it were a recent skull, would\r\ngive any trustworthy clue to the race to which it might appertain.\r\n\"Assuredly there is no mark of degradation about any part of its\r\nstructure. It is, in fact, a fair average human skull, which might have\r\nbelonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless\r\nbrains of a savage.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1833 and the spring of the following year were spent in\r\nLondon. It was evidently a busy, though uneventful, time: a new edition\r\nof the \"Principles\" was being prepared and printed, a paper read to the\r\nGeological Society on a freshwater formation at Cerdagne in the\r\nPyrenees, and information collected for a summer's journey. This was to\r\nbe in a new direction--to Scandinavia--with the more especial intent of\r\nstudying the evidence on which it has been asserted that the shores of\r\nthe Baltic had changed their level within recent times. But on this\r\noccasion Mrs. Lyell remained at home, as the travelling might\r\noccasionally have been too rough for her so we find, in a journal\r\nwritten for her perusal, a full sketch of a tour which proved, as he had\r\nanticipated, to be fruitful in scientific results. His first halt was at\r\nHamburg, where, on his arrival, with characteristic energy he dashed off\r\nat once in a carriage to examine a section below Altona which he had\r\nmarked down on his voyage up the Elbe. This is his brief summary:\r\n\"Cliffs sixty or seventy feet high. Filled three pages of note-book. Saw\r\nthe source of the great Holstein granite blocks. Gathered shells thrown\r\nashore by the Elbe.\" From Hamburg he drove to Luebeck, along one of the\r\nworst of roads. The primary cause of its badness was geological--a loose\r\nsand interspersed with granite boulders; the secondary, the royal\r\nrevenues; for these largely depended on the tolls paid by vessels on\r\nentering the sound, and if a good road had connected the two towns much\r\nmerchandise would have gone overland, to the king's loss. At Luebeck\r\nLyell for the first time stood upon the shore of the Baltic, and\r\nutilised the half-hour before his steamer started for Copenhagen by\r\nhunting for shells. As a reward, he found a well-known freshwater genus\r\n(_Paludina_) among common marine forms.[71]\r\n\r\nFrom Copenhagen a rapid journey in Seeland and to Moeen introduced him to\r\na number of interesting Sections of the drift, accounts of which were\r\nafterwards worked into his books, and showed him at Faxoe and elsewhere\r\nlimestones overlying the upper chalk, like those at Maestricht in\r\nHolland, and at Meudon near Paris. All these limestones possess an\r\nexceptional interest, for they contain a mixture of Secondary with\r\nTertiary fossils, and thus help to fill up the wide gap between these\r\ntwo great divisions in Britain and the adjacent parts of Europe. On his\r\nreturn to Copenhagen Lyell was very kindly received by the Crown Prince,\r\nwho was an ardent naturalist, and allowed him to examine a fine\r\ncollection of minerals and fossils accumulated by himself.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Sound to Malmoe, Lyell spent about a fortnight in\r\ndriving along an inland route through the southern part of Sweden to\r\nNorrkoeping, while a halt at Lund afforded the opportunity of pleasant\r\ntalks with the professors of the University, and of seeing some\r\nformations of which hitherto he had not had much experience. The terms\r\nin which he refers to these indirectly proves what strides geology has\r\ntaken in the last sixty years. \"We made an excursion together through a\r\ncountry of greywacke with orthoceratite limestone and schist,[72]\r\ncontaining a curious zoophyte called graptolite in great abundance, and\r\na few shells.\" On the journey also he found much to interest a\r\ngeologist--boulders almost everywhere, some of huge size, lying on the\r\nsurface or scattered in the sand in one place an outcrop of Cretaceous\r\ngreensand, full of belemnites, which were popularly regarded as\r\n\"witches' candles.\" Then over a picturesque granite region--\"a country\r\nof rock, fir-wood, and peasants\"--till he arrived at Norrkoeping, and\r\nmade his way in a steamer down one fjord and up another until he came\r\ninto the Malar Lake. These last stages introduced him to a kind of\r\nscenery of which Scandinavia affords such striking and innumerable\r\nexamples--the margin of a submerged mountain land. \"We entered,\" he\r\nsays, \"a passage between an endless string of islets and the mainland,\r\nthe water here smooth as a millpond. We passed swiftly on in deep water\r\nclose to the rocks, on the barest of which are a few firs in the clefts.\r\nThese are evidently the summits of submarine mountains.\" At Stockholm he\r\nfound plenty to be done. Some of the evidence, which had been brought\r\nforward to prove a rising of the land, was obviously weak. For instance,\r\non one of his first visits to a place where the upward movement was said\r\nto be comparatively rapid, he found a fine oak-tree, perhaps a couple of\r\ncenturies old, growing eight feet above high-water mark, and thus\r\nindicating either that oak-trees had recently changed their habits or\r\nthat the change of level had been slow. \"In dealing with this question\r\nit is necessary,\" he writes, \"to cross-examine both nature and man. The\r\ntestimony of the former is strong; of the latter, I must say, so weak\r\nand contradictory that I require to know the men and find how they got\r\ntheir views.\" A valuable precaution this, which might be remembered with\r\nadvantage in days when stay-at-home geologists are far too numerous. If\r\nthis were done, the paper currency of the science would be considerably\r\nreduced in quantity, and there would be a closer correspondence between\r\nits real and its nominal value. A little scepticism was certainly\r\njustifiable, for one would-be _savant_ stood him out \"that a bed of\r\n_Cardium edule_ (the common cockle) 100 feet high proves that the _fresh\r\nwater_ of Lake Malar was once that much higher.\" Lyell adds nothing to\r\nthis remark, but his silence is eloquent.\r\n\r\nThis expedition, however--to Soedertelje--gave results yet more striking\r\nthan marine shells 100 feet above the present level of the Baltic. \"What\r\nthink you,\" he writes, \"of ships in the same formation, nay, a _house_?\r\nIt is as true as the Temple of Serapis.[73] I do not mean that I\r\ndiscovered all this, but I shall be the first to give a geological\r\naccount of it. I am in high spirits at the prize.\" Upsala also, to which\r\nhe next moved, increased his stores of knowledge and of fossils. \"I went\r\nto the hill, a hundred feet high, on which the tower stands, to examine\r\nmarine shells. All of Baltic species. You remember that in the half-hour\r\nbetween the two steamboats at Luebeck, or rather Travemunde, I collected\r\nshells by the quay. Not one fossil have I found newer than the chalk in\r\nSweden, that was not in the number of those found living in that\r\nhalf-hour.\" More localities for shells were visited, erratics were\r\nexamined, and pilots were questioned closely \"about the agency of ice,\r\nin which they believe.\" With their opinion Lyell inclined to agree; at\r\nany rate, he was convinced that his observations would \"quite overset\r\nthe _debacle_ theory,\" and, as he expected, \"bring in ice carriage as\r\nthe cause.\" On the coast further north at Oregrund and Gefle,\r\nbench-marks had been cut some years previously in order to apply a more\r\nexact test to the question of the change in levels. These he visited,\r\nand the former seemed to prove \"as Galileo said in a different sense,\r\nthat 'the earth moves.'\" The marks near Gefle afforded similar\r\ntestimony, so that he felt now that the main object of his journey was\r\naccomplished, and inserted this pregnant note in his journal:--\"I feel\r\nnow what I was very sensible of when correcting my last edition,[74]\r\nthat I was not justified in writing any more until I had done all in my\r\npower to ascertain the truth in regard to the 'great northern\r\nphenomenon,' as the gradual rise of part of Sweden has been very\r\nnaturally called. You will see by-and-by how important a point it was,\r\nand how materially it will modify my mode of treating the science, and\r\nhow much it will advance the theory of the agency of existing causes as\r\na key to explain geological phenomena.\"[75]\r\n\r\nBut the work at sea-marks was not yet quite ended, and there was besides\r\nanother classic spot to be visited--Uddevalla, between Lake Werner and\r\nthe western coast. Here are deposits in which sea-shells are abundant at\r\na height of about two hundred feet above the sea. Nothing but a\r\nsubmergence can account for their presence, for polyzoa and barnacles\r\nare found attached to the solid rock. Some of the latter, adhering to\r\nthe gneiss, were collected by Lyell on this occasion.[76]\r\n\r\nFossil shells (of existing species) were so numerous that, he says, the\r\ndeposit was worked for making lime, and he compares it with a well-known\r\nbed in the Tertiaries of the Paris Basin. The shells, however, at\r\nUddevalla, as he points out, are not of that brackish-water character\r\npeculiar to the Baltic, but such as now live in the Northern Ocean.[77]\r\nOn reaching the coast he made an expedition by boat, and saw the\r\nbench-mark at Gullholmen, and rocks which had emerged from the sea\r\nwithin the memory of people still living. Here, by way of completing his\r\nwork, he \"hired the services of a smith to make a mark at the water's\r\nedge:--\r\n\r\n    C. 18. L.\r\n       ------\r\n   18. 7. 34.\"\r\n   -----------\r\n\r\nSo he brought his journey in Scandinavia to a close, and by the end of\r\nJuly had reached Kinnordy, where Mrs. Lyell awaited his coming. Then he\r\nset to work to prepare a brief sketch of his investigations for the\r\napproaching meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh, and a more\r\nelaborate paper, to be communicated to the Royal Society in London, in\r\nwhich he set forth the reasons which had convinced him that in Sweden,\r\n\"both on the Baltic and ocean side, part of that country is really\r\nundergoing a gradual and insensibly slow rise.\" It affects an area\r\nmeasuring about one thousand miles north and south, and is believed to\r\nreach a maximum at the North Cape. There it is said, but the statement\r\nneeds verification, to amount to five feet in a century; at Gefle,\r\nninety miles north of Stockholm, it cannot be more than two or three\r\nfeet in the same time; while at Stockholm itself it can hardly exceed\r\nsix inches. Further south, in Scania proper, as at Malmoe, Skanoer,\r\nTrelleborg, and Ystad, the movement is distinctly in an opposite\r\ndirection.[78]\r\n\r\nThis paper was afterwards accepted by the Royal Society as the Bakerian\r\nlecture for the year. But the preparation of this was not Lyell's only\r\noccupation. In October he had begun fossil ichthyology, was attending\r\nlectures in chemistry, and \"had made some progress,\" as he writes to\r\nMantell, \"in a single volume which two years ago I promised Murray, a\r\npurely elementary work for beginners in geology, and which I find more\r\nagreeable work than I had expected.\" So his hands were pretty full. A\r\npleasant surprise came in the closing months of the year, namely the\r\naward of one of the Royal Medals by that Society in acknowledgment of\r\nthe merits of his \"Principles of Geology.\"\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of 1835 Lyell accepted the presidency of the\r\nGeological Society, an office which, it will be remembered, he had\r\nvirtually refused a couple of years before, when he was busy with his\r\ngreat book. With this exception, nothing worthy of record appears to\r\nhave happened in the first six months of the year, but in July Mrs.\r\nLyell and he left England for a journey to France, Germany, and\r\nSwitzerland. By that date, as he mentions in a letter to a friend, 1,750\r\ncopies of the last edition of the \"Principles\" had been sold, a demand\r\nthat puts him in good heart as to the future of the book, and proves\r\nthat his labours on it had not been in vain. But he did not permit\r\nhimself to be idle. As a letter written to Sedgwick from Paris shows, he\r\nwas still working away at the classification of the Tertiary deposits;\r\nfor in this letter he discusses the relation of the coralline and the\r\nred, or shelly Crag of Suffolk. Mr. Charlesworth, subsequently well\r\nknown as a collector, had been obtaining a number of fossil shells from\r\nthe former deposit, and the character of these suggested that it was\r\ndistinctly the older of the two, as is now universally admitted. In\r\ndiscussing this question Lyell lays down a principle of classification\r\nthe soundness of which has been proved by experience, namely, that the\r\nage of a Tertiary deposit is to be determined by the proportion of\r\nrecent species and the relation of these to the forms still living in\r\nthe neighbouring seas. If, for instance, the recent shells in a\r\nformation, amounting to one-half, or even as few as one-third, of the\r\ntotal number can be thus found, the formation will be Pliocene in age,\r\n\"while the recent shells of the Miocene have a more exotic and tropical\r\nform.\" To this conclusion he had been led, by an examination, with the\r\nhelp of Deshayes, of a typical collection of Crag fossils which he had\r\ncarried with him to Paris. As to other matters, the leading French\r\ngeologists were still warring vigorously in defence of deluges, and none\r\nof his numerous heresies, he remarks, appears \"to have excited so much\r\nhonest indignation as his recent attempt to convey some of the huge\r\nScandinavian blocks to their present destination by means of ice.\" He\r\nhad proved, he reminds Sedgwick, that \"some of the great blocks near\r\nUpsala must have travelled to their present destination since the Baltic\r\nwas a brackish water sea, so that those who maintain that there was one,\r\nand one only, rush of water, which scattered all the blocks of Sweden\r\nand the Alps, must make out this catastrophe to be, as it were, an\r\naffair of yesterday.\" Geology, even at that date, had advanced far\r\nenough for this admission to have landed the diluvialists in some\r\nawkward dilemmas, to say nothing of the physical difficulties which they\r\nwould find in accounting for the existence of waves or currents potent\r\nenough to bowl the _Pierre a bot_ from the aiguilles round the Trient\r\nglacier to the slopes of the Jura, or to fling the erratics of\r\nScandinavia broadcast over the lowlands around the Baltic. This,\r\nhowever, was not the only lost cause over which the French geologists\r\nwere holding their shield. Lyell goes on to write, with a touch of quiet\r\nsarcasm: \"As to the elevation crater business, Von Buch, de Beaumont,\r\nand Dufresnoy are to write and prove that Somma and Etna are elevation\r\ncraters, and Von Buch himself has just gone to Auvergne to prove that\r\nMont Dore is one also.\"\r\n\r\nLyell's special intention in visiting the Alps was to obtain evidence as\r\nto the relation of the metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Geologists of\r\nthe Wernerian School, with sundry others who hardly went so far as the\r\nFreiberg professor, maintained that the crystalline schists, including\r\ngneiss, had been produced, often as precipitates, in a primaeval ocean,\r\nthe waters of which were far too hot to allow of the existence of life.\r\nAt a later time, as the temperature fell, the great masses of slightly\r\naltered slates and grits were deposited--the region of \"greywacke,\" the\r\ntransitional rocks as they were commonly called. These for the most part\r\nwere unfossiliferous, at any rate in their earliest stages. To this\r\nview, of course, the Huttonian dictum, which Lyell sought to establish,\r\nwas diametrically opposed, viz. that the earth showed no signs of a\r\nbeginning. Now he had been informed that in the Alps certain slaty rocks\r\ncontained fossils which indicated an age corresponding generally with\r\nthe chalk of England, and that in other parts of that chain even\r\ncrystalline schists could be found interbedded with fossiliferous strata\r\nof Secondary age. To settle the former question he intended to visit the\r\nfamous quarries of Glarus, but was ultimately compelled to leave this\r\nfor another year, as he took the latter point first in order of time,\r\nand the investigation of it involved more work than he had anticipated.\r\nIn regard to this, the most important sections were to be found on the\r\nprecipitous northern slopes of the Jungfrau and in the upper part of the\r\nUrbach-thal, a lonely glen which descends into the main valley of the\r\nAar at Imhof, above Meyringen. In both these localities gneiss appears\r\nto overlie \"fossiliferous limestone,\" and Lyell, after visiting them,\r\nreturned satisfied that he had seen \"alternations of the gneiss with\r\nlimestone of the lias or something newer in the highest regions of the\r\nAlps.\" That undoubtedly he saw, but he did not suspect that the\r\nappearance was illusory. This was not in the least surprising; the Alps\r\nwere still almost a terra incognita; the processes of \"mountain making\"\r\nas yet were unknown; many statements in common currency as to the\r\npassage of sedimentary into crystalline rocks were erroneous and\r\ndistinctly misleading. Only by degrees was it discovered that this\r\nsuperposition of gneiss or crystalline schist to Secondary rock was due\r\nto folding on a scale so gigantic that the older had been doubled over\r\nupon the younger rock and the apparent order of succession was the\r\nconverse of the true one. The intercalation also of the gneiss and the\r\nJurassic limestone was a result of a similar action, but carried, if\r\npossible, to an even greater extreme, for here the hard gneiss had been\r\nthrust in wedge-like slabs between the softer masses of sedimentary\r\nrock, like a paper-knife between the leaves of a book; that is to say,\r\nthe gneiss and crystalline schists in both cases were vastly more\r\nancient than the fossiliferous limestone. It is only of late years that\r\nthis startling fact has been established beyond question; and even now\r\nthere are many geologists who do not appear to recognise how seriously\r\nthe Huttonian _dictum_ \"there is no sign of a beginning\" has been shaken\r\nby the collapse of this evidence. At the present time the question is in\r\nthis position; all the attempts to prove crystalline schists to be of\r\nthe same age as, or younger than, fossiliferous sedimentary rocks either\r\nhave been complete failures or have proved to be very dubious, while in\r\nmany cases these schists are demonstrably earlier than the oldest rocks\r\nof the district to which a date can be assigned. Hence, though possibly\r\nit may turn out that the disciples of Hutton were right, and that, as\r\nLyell thought, a metamorphic rock may be of almost any geological age,\r\nhis hypothesis not only is unproved, but also the evidence which has\r\nbeen brought forward in its favour has turned out after a strict\r\nscrutiny to be exceedingly dubious, if not absolutely contrary. In\r\nregard to this question we may feel a little surprise that one\r\ndifficulty did not occur to Lyell's sceptical mind, namely: what could\r\nbe the nature and cause of a process of metamorphism which could convert\r\none sediment into a crystalline schist--changed practically past\r\nrecognition--and leave its neighbour so far unaltered that its\r\ncharacteristic fossils could be readily recognised?\r\n\r\nBut though he was unable to investigate the question of Secondary or\r\nperhaps early Tertiary fossils in the \"transition\"-like rock of Glarus,\r\nhis study of the sedimentary deposits of the Bernese Oberland, which had\r\nformed a necessary preliminary to the other inquiry, raised some\r\ndifficulties in his mind as to the origin of slaty cleavage. At a\r\nmeeting of the Geological Society in the month of March, Professor\r\nSedgwick had read his classic paper[79] on this subject, in which he\r\nestablished the independence of cleavage and bedding. This paper laid\r\nthe foundation for the discovery of the true cause of the former\r\nstructure, though its author was unable, with the information then at\r\nhis command, to do more than suggest an hypothesis, which afterwards\r\nproved to be incorrect. He had shown that both the strike and the dip of\r\ncleavage-planes were persistent over large areas, and that while the one\r\nmight gradually change its direction and the other its angle of\r\ninclination, if they were followed far enough, yet this angle usually\r\nremained unaltered for considerable distances, and appeared to be quite\r\nunaffected by any variation in the slope of the strata. From these\r\nobservations it followed that the planes of cleavage ought not to be\r\ncoincident with those of bedding. Lyell, however, writes to tell\r\nSedgwick[80]:--\r\n\r\n      \"I found the cleavage or slaty structure of fine drawing\r\n      slate in the great quarry of the Niesen, on the east [south]\r\n      side of the Lake of Thun, quite coincided with the dip of\r\n      the strata ascertained by alternate beds of greywacke.... As\r\n      it is the best description of drawing slate, and as\r\n      divisible almost as mica into thin plates, I cannot make out\r\n      how to distinguish such a structure from any which can be\r\n      called slaty, and such an attempt would, I fear, involve the\r\n      subject in great confusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe observation was perfectly correct, and many like instances could be\r\nfound in the Alps; nevertheless, Sedgwick was right in his\r\ngeneralisation, and the two structures are perfectly independent, though\r\nthe difficulty raised by Lyell did not disappear till the true cause of\r\nslaty cleavage was recognised--viz. that it is a result of pressure.\r\nThus, in a region like the Alps, where the strata often have been so\r\ncompletely folded as to be bent, so to say, back to back, the planes of\r\ncleavage, which are produced when the rocks can no longer yield to the\r\npressure by bending, necessarily coincide with those of bedding. Still,\r\neven in these cases, if careful search be made in the vicinity, some\r\nminor flexure generally betrays the secret, and exhibits the cleavage\r\nstructure cutting across that of bedding.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1836, flowed on, like the last, quietly and uneventfully;\r\na fifth edition of the \"Principles\" was passing through the press; the\r\n\"Elements of Geology\" was making progress, though slowly; and Lyell's\r\nduties as President of the Geological Society, which involved the\r\ndelivery of an address in the month of February and the preparation of\r\nanother one for the same season in the following year, occupied a good\r\ndeal of his time. The summer was spent in a long visit to his parents at\r\nKinnordy, after which he and Mrs. Lyell made some stay in the Isle of\r\nArran before they returned to London. The latter seemingly had been\r\nrather out of health, and this may have been the reason why a longer\r\njourney was not undertaken, but she must have found the Scotch air a\r\ncomplete restorative, for after her return to London in the autumn Lyell\r\nwrites to his father that \"everyone is much struck with the improvement\r\nin Mary's health and appearance.\"\r\n\r\nBut one letter, of the few which have been preserved from those written\r\nin 1836, possesses a special interest, for it expresses his ideas, at\r\nthis epoch, in regard to the question of the origin of species, and\r\nindicates his freedom from prejudice and the openness of his mind. It is\r\naddressed to Sir John Herschel, then engaged in his memorable\r\ninvestigations at the Cape of Good Hope, who had favoured him with some\r\nvaluable comments and criticisms on the Principles of Geology, and in\r\nthe course of these had corrected a mistake which Lyell had made in\r\nregard to a rather difficult physical question. In referring to this,\r\nthe latter remarks that the clearness of the mathematical reasoning (to\r\nquote his words) \"made me regret that I had not given some of the years\r\nwhich I devoted to Greek plays and Aristotle at Oxford, and afterwards\r\nto law and other desultory pursuits, to mathematics.\" Doubtless there is\r\nhardly any better foundation for geology than a course of mathematics;\r\nat the same time, classical studies did much to give Lyell his lucidity\r\nand elegance of style, and thus to ensure the success of the \"Principles\r\nof Geology.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be best to give Lyell's own words, for the document forms an\r\nappendix or lengthy postscript. As is incidentally mentioned, it was not\r\nin his own handwriting,[81] and thus probably was drawn up with rather\r\nmore than usual care.\r\n\r\n      \"In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad\r\n      to find that you think it probable it may be carried on\r\n      through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this\r\n      rather to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to offend\r\n      a certain class of persons by embodying in words what would\r\n      only be a speculation.... When I first came to the\r\n      notion--which I never saw expressed elsewhere, though I have\r\n      no doubt it had all been thought out before--of a succession\r\n      of extinction of species, and creation of new ones, going on\r\n      perpetually now, and through an indefinite period of the\r\n      past, and to continue for ages to come, all in accommodation\r\n      to the changes which must continue in the inanimate and\r\n      habitable earth, the idea struck me as the grandest which I\r\n      had ever conceived, so far as regards the attributes of the\r\n      Presiding Mind. For one can in imagination summon before us\r\n      a small part[82] at least of the circumstances which must be\r\n      contemplated and foreknown, before it can be decided what\r\n      powers and qualities a new species must have in order to\r\n      enable it to endure for a given time, and to play its part\r\n      in due relation to all other beings destined to coexist with\r\n      it, before it dies out. It might be necessary, perhaps, to\r\n      be able to know the number by which each species would be\r\n      represented in a given region 10,000 years hence, as much as\r\n      for Babbage to find what would be the place of every wheel\r\n      in his new calculating machine at each movement.\r\n\r\n      \"It may be seen that unless some slight additional\r\n      precaution be taken, the species about to be born would at a\r\n      certain era be reduced to too low a number. There may be a\r\n      thousand modes of ensuring its duration beyond that time;\r\n      one, for example, may be the rendering it more prolific, but\r\n      this would perhaps make it press too hard upon other species\r\n      at other times. Now, if it be an insect it may be made in\r\n      one of its transformations to resemble a dead stick, or a\r\n      lichen, or a stone, so as to be less easily found by its\r\n      enemies; or if this would make it too strong, an occasional\r\n      variety of the species may have this advantage conferred\r\n      upon it; or if this would be still too much, one sex of a\r\n      certain variety. Probably there is scarcely a dash of colour\r\n      on the wing or body, of which the choice would be quite\r\n      arbitrary, or what might not affect its duration for\r\n      thousands of years. I have been told that the leaf-like\r\n      expansions of the abdomen and thighs of a certain Brazilian\r\n      Mantis turn from green to yellow as autumn advances,\r\n      together with the leaves of the plants among which it seeks\r\n      for its prey. Now if species come in in succession, such\r\n      contrivances must sometimes be made, and such relations\r\n      predetermined between species, as the Mantis for example,\r\n      and plants not then existing, but which it was foreseen\r\n      would exist together with some particular climate at a given\r\n      time. But I cannot do justice to this train of speculation\r\n      in a letter, and will only say that it seems to me to offer\r\n      a more beautiful subject for reasoning and reflecting on,\r\n      than the notion of great batches of species all coming in,\r\n      and afterwards going out at once.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in October Charles Darwin, for whose return from his noted voyage\r\non the _Beagle_ Lyell had more than once expressed an earnest desire,\r\narrived in England, bringing with him a large collection of specimens\r\nand almost innumerable facts, geological and biological, the fruits of\r\nhis travels. The biological observations slowly ripened in Darwin's mind\r\ntill they had for their final result the \"Origin of Species.\" The\r\ngeological stirred Lyell to immediate enthusiasm, for they afforded a\r\nvaluable support to some of the ideas which he had put forward to the\r\n\"Principles.\" \"The idea of the Pampas going up,\" he writes to Darwin,\r\n\"at the rate of an inch a century, while the Western Coast and Andes\r\nrise many feet and unequally, has long been a dream of mine. What a\r\nsplendid field you have to write upon!\" The enthusiasm evidently was not\r\nconfined to words, for Darwin himself says in writing to Professor\r\nHenslow, \"Mr. Lyell has entered in the most good-natured manner, and\r\nalmost without being asked, into all my plans.\"[83] The letter to\r\nDarwin,[84] which is quoted above, also contains a characteristic piece\r\nof advice.\r\n\r\n      \"Don't accept any official scientific place if you can avoid\r\n      it, and tell no one I gave you this advice, as they would\r\n      all cry out against me as the preacher of anti-patriotic\r\n      principles. I fought against the calamity of being President\r\n      [of the Geological Society] as long as I could. All has gone\r\n      on smoothly, and it has not cost me more time than I\r\n      anticipated; but my question is, whether the time\r\n      annihilated by learned bodies ('par les affaires\r\n      administratives') is balanced by any good they do. Fancy\r\n      exchanging Herschel at the Cape for Herschel as President of\r\n      the Royal Society, which he so narrowly escaped being, and I\r\n      voting for him too! I hope to be forgiven for that. At\r\n      least, work as I did, exclusively for yourself and for\r\n      Science for many years, and do not prematurely incur the\r\n      honour or the penalty of official dignities. There are\r\n      people who may be profitably employed in such duties,\r\n      because they would not work if not so engaged.\"\r\n\r\nNot very altruistic advice, it may be feared, but nevertheless bearing\r\nthe stamp of practical wisdom. Committee-work and other official duties\r\nare terrible wasters of time, and thus, although often necessary and\r\ninevitable, are rightly regarded as evils. Many men, as Lyell intimates,\r\nhave been seriously hindered in researches for which they were\r\nexceptionally fitted by allowing themselves to be at everyone's beck and\r\ncall, and getting their days cut to shreds by meetings. So far has this\r\ngone in some cases, that the high promise of early days has been very\r\ninadequately fulfilled, and some great piece of work has been never\r\ncompleted. If the spirit in which Lyell writes were more frequent, the\r\ncommon illusion that workers in science belong to some inferior branch\r\nof the public service would be dispelled, and the business of scientific\r\nsocieties would sometimes run more smoothly; at any rate, it would be\r\nfinished more quickly, because no one would care to waste time over\r\nsplitting hairs, and hunting for knots in a bullrush.[85]\r\n\r\nThe year 1837, like the preceding one, was spent in quiet work, though\r\nthree months of the summer were devoted to a journey on the Continent.\r\nAs regards the former, it is evident that the book on which he was\r\nengaged had caused him more than ordinary difficulty, for it appears to\r\nhave progressed more slowly than can be explained either by the duties\r\nof the Presidential chair, which he resigned in the month of February of\r\nthis year, or by any distraction caused by other scientific work. But a\r\nsentence in a letter written to one of his sisters at the beginning of\r\nMay throws some light on the cause of the delay. He says, \"I have at\r\nlast struck out a plan for the future splitting of the 'Principles' into\r\n'Principles' and 'Elements' as two separate works, which pleases me very\r\nmuch, so now I shall get on rapidly.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer journey was to Denmark and the south of Norway, and this time\r\nMrs. Lyell was able to bear him company. They left London early in June\r\nfor Hamburg, crossing Holstein to Kiel, and travelling thence to\r\nCopenhagen. Here he set to work at once with Dr. Beck to study fossil\r\nshells, in the Crown Prince's cabinet and in the other museums of the\r\ncity. Questions had arisen as to the nomenclature of various fossil\r\nspecies to which Lyell had referred in his book, on which Dr. Beck\r\ndiffered from Deshayes, so that Lyell was anxious to investigate some of\r\nthe points for himself, and to see the original type-specimens in\r\nLinnaeus' collection, since these, in some cases, had been wrongly\r\nidentified by Lamarck and other palaeontologists. During a drive with\r\nthe Crown Prince, he had the opportunity of examining an interesting\r\nsection of the drift a few miles from Copenhagen, where it \"was composed\r\nto a great depth of innumerable rolled blocks of chalk with a few of\r\ngranite intermixed. Fossils were numerous in the chalk.... Prince\r\nChristian set four men to work, while the horses were baiting, to clear\r\naway the talus, by which I saw that the boulders of chalk were in fact\r\nin beds, with occasional layers of sand between.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching Norway Lyell made several expeditions from Christiania, in\r\nthe course of which he examined a clay which occupies valleys and other\r\nparts of the granite region. This, which sometimes is found more than\r\n600 feet above sea-level, he states \"is a marine deposit containing\r\nrecent species of shells, such as now inhabit the fjords of Norway.\"\r\n\r\nThis visit to Norway gave Lyell the opportunity of dispelling some\r\nerroneous ideas as to the relation of the granite to the \"transition\"\r\n(or lower Palaeozoic) strata. This granite he found to be intrusive into\r\nthese rocks, and into the much more ancient gneiss on which they rested.\r\nThe sedimentary rocks near the junction were much altered, the\r\nlimestones being changed into marble, the shale into micaceous schists;\r\nthe fossils being more completely obliterated in the latter than in the\r\nformer case. Some remarks which he makes as to the relations of the\r\ngranite and gneiss indicate the closeness and carefulness of his\r\nobservations. \"This gneiss ... this most ancient rock is so beautifully\r\nsoldered on to the granite, so nicely threaded by veins large and small,\r\nor in other cases so shades into the granite, that had you not known the\r\nimmense difference in age, you would be half-staggered with the\r\nsuspicion that all was made at one batch.\"[86]\r\n\r\nFrom Copenhagen, on their return, they went to Luebeck and drove thence\r\nto Hamburg, across the sand and boulder formation of the Baltic, and so\r\nthrough the north of Germany. Among these boulders Lyell recognised the\r\nred granite, which he had seen in Norway sending off veins into the\r\northoceratite limestones and associated Silurian rocks. This \"had been\r\ncarried, with small gravel of the same, by ice of course, over the south\r\nof Norway, and thence down the south-west of Sweden, and all over\r\nJutland and Holstein down to the Elbe, from whence they come to the\r\nWeser, and so to this or near this (Wesel-on-the-Rhine). But it is\r\ncurious that about Muenster and Osnabruck, the low Secondary mountains\r\nhave stopped them; hills of chalk, Muschelkalk, old coal, etc., which\r\nrise a few hundred feet in general above the great plain of north and\r\nnorth-west Germany, effectually arrest their passage. This then was\r\nalready dry land when Holstein, and all the Baltic as far as Osnabruck\r\nor the Teutoberger Waldhills, was submerged.\"[87]\r\n\r\nAt the end of September they returned to London through Paris and\r\nNormandy, and the rest of the year was mainly devoted to the completion\r\nof the \"Elements of Geology.\" Little seems to have happened in the\r\nearlier part of the next year (1838); and in the summer Lyell went\r\nnorthward, halting on the way, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, to attend the\r\nmeeting of the British Association. Here he was made President of the\r\nGeological Section, which appears to have been very successful, for he\r\nwrites that the section was crowded--from 1,000 to 1,500 persons always\r\npresent. The meeting, altogether, was a large one; but as the total\r\nnumber of tickets issued only amounted to 2,400, it seems probable that\r\nthe general public was admitted more freely than is the custom at the\r\npresent day. Sedgwick also on one occasion attracted a large crowd, for\r\nwe are told that he delivered a most eloquent lecture \"to 3,000 people\r\non the Sea-shore.\" Geology, no doubt, has made great advances since that\r\nday, little more than half a century ago, but at the cost of much loss\r\nof attractiveness. It was then simple in its terminology, and fairly\r\nintelligible to people of ordinary education; now these are frightened\r\naway by papers bristling with technical terms and Greek-born words, and\r\nnothing but the prospect of a \"scrimmage\" would draw together 500 people\r\nto a meeting of Section C at the present day. Commonly the audience\r\nhardly amounts to one-fifth of that number. Geologists, perhaps, might\r\nconsider with advantage whether a little abstinence from long words\r\nmight not make the science more generally intelligible, and thus more\r\nattractive, without any loss of real precision.\r\n\r\nThe \"Elements of Geology\" was finally published a few weeks before the\r\nNewcastle meeting, and the work of recasting the \"Principles\" went on at\r\nintervals in preparation for the sixth edition, which appeared in 1840.\r\nIf, in accordance with the maxim, a nation is happy which has no\r\nhistory, Lyell ought to have passed almost a year in a state of\r\nfelicity, for nothing is recorded between September 6th, 1838, when he\r\nwrites to Charles Darwin from Kinnordy, and August 1st, 1839, when he\r\nwrites to Dr. Fitton from the same place. Both these letters are\r\ninteresting. The former discusses the relation of Darwin's theory of the\r\nformation of coral islands with E. de Beaumont's idea of the\r\ncontemporaneity of parallel mountain chains, which has been already\r\nmentioned. One passage also throws light upon the difficulties with\r\nwhich the British Association in its earlier days had to contend. Some\r\nof the most influential newspapers had set themselves to write it\r\ndown--needless to say, without success. Good sense sometimes is too\r\nstrong even for newspapers. But Lyell thus urges Darwin[88]:--\r\n\r\n      \"Do not let Broderip, or the _Times_ or the _Age_ or _John\r\n      Bull_, nor any papers, whether of saints or sinners, induce\r\n      you to join in running down the British Association. I do\r\n      not mean to insinuate that you ever did so, but I have\r\n      myself often seen its faults in a strong light, and am aware\r\n      of what may be urged against philosophers turning public\r\n      orators, etc. But I am convinced--although it is not the way\r\n      I love to spend my own time--that in this country no\r\n      importance is attached to any body of men who do not make\r\n      occasional demonstrations of their strength in public\r\n      meetings. It is a country where, as Tom Moore justly\r\n      complained, a most exaggerated importance is attached to the\r\n      faculty of thinking on your legs, and where, as Dan\r\n      O'Connell very well knows, nothing is to be got in the way\r\n      of homage or influence, or even a fair share of power,\r\n      without agitation.\"\r\n\r\nFar-reaching words, the truth of which has been demonstrated again and\r\nagain during the years which have elapsed since they were written. Lyell\r\nlays his finger on the weakest spot in the nature of the true-born\r\nBriton: he is deaf to quiet reasoning, and frightened by loud shoutings.\r\n\r\nThe second letter, that of 1839, is addressed to Dr. Fitton, who had\r\nwritten for the _Edinburgh Review_ a criticism of the \"Principles of\r\nGeology,\" in which he had expressed the opinion that Lyell had\r\ninsufficiently acknowledged the value of Hutton's work. From this charge\r\nLyell defends himself, pointing out that, valuable as were Hutton's\r\ncontributions to the philosophy of geology, he was by no means the first\r\nin the field--that there were also \"mighty men of old\" to whom he felt\r\nbound to do justice, even at the risk of seeming to undervalue the great\r\nScotchman. He points out that Hutton's work occupies a fair amount of\r\nspace in the section of the \"Principles\" which is devoted to an\r\nhistorical sketch of the earlier geologists:--\r\n\r\n      \"In my first chapter,\" he writes, \"I gave Hutton credit for\r\n      first separating geology from other sciences, and declaring\r\n      it to have no concern with the origin of things;[89] and\r\n      after rapidly discussing a great number of celebrated\r\n      writers, I pause to give, comparatively speaking,\r\n      full-length portraits of Werner and Hutton, giving the\r\n      latter the decided palm of theoretical excellence, and\r\n      alluding to the two grand points in which he advanced the\r\n      science--first, the igneous origin of granite; secondly,\r\n      that the so-called primitive rocks were altered strata.[90]\r\n      I dwelt emphatically on the complete revolution brought\r\n      about by his new views respecting granite, and entered fully\r\n      on Playfair's illustrations and defence of Hutton.... The\r\n      mottoes of my first two volumes were especially selected\r\n      from Playfair's 'Huttonian Theory' because--although I was\r\n      brought round slowly, against some of my early prejudices,\r\n      to adopt Playfair's doctrines to the full extent--I was\r\n      desirous to acknowledge his and Hutton's priority. And I\r\n      have a letter of Basil Hall's, in which, after speaking of\r\n      points in which Hutton approached nearer to my doctrines\r\n      than his father, Sir James Hall, he comments on the manner\r\n      in which my very title-page did homage to the Huttonians,\r\n      and complimented me for thus disavowing all pretensions to\r\n      be the originator of the theory of the adequacy of modern\r\n      causes.\"[91]\r\n\r\nIn the following month Lyell attended a meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Birmingham, and was invited, together with several of the\r\nleading men of science there present, to dine and spend the night at\r\nDrayton Manor, the residence of Sir R. Peel, near Tamworth. In a letter\r\nto one of his sisters, Lyell gives an interesting sketch of his\r\nimpressions of the great statesman:--\r\n\r\n      \"Some of the party said next day that Peel never gave an\r\n      opinion for or against any point from extra-caution, but I\r\n      really thought that he expressed himself as freely, even on\r\n      subjects bordering on the political, as a well-bred man\r\n      could do when talking to another with whose opinions he was\r\n      unacquainted. He was very curious to know what Vernon\r\n      Harcourt [the President for that year] had said on the\r\n      connection of religion and science. I told him of it, and my\r\n      own ideas, and in the middle of my strictures on the Dean of\r\n      York's pamphlet[92] I exclaimed, 'By-the-bye, I have only\r\n      just remembered that he is your brother-in-law.' He said,\r\n      'Yes, he is a clever man and a good writer, but if men will\r\n      not read any one book written by scientific men on such a\r\n      subject, they must take the consequences.' ... If I had not\r\n      known Sir Robert's extensive acquirements, I should only\r\n      have thought him an intelligent, well-informed country\r\n      gentleman; not slow, but without any quickness, free from\r\n      that kind of party feeling which prevents men from\r\n      appreciating those who differ from them, taking pleasure in\r\n      improvements, without enthusiasm, not capable of joining in\r\n      a hearty laugh at a good joke, but cheerful, and not\r\n      preventing Lord Northampton, Whewell, and others from making\r\n      merry. He is without a tincture of science, and interested\r\n      in it only so far as knowing its importance in the arts, and\r\n      as a subject with which a large body of persons of talent\r\n      are occupied.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe next year (1840) appears to have slipped away uneventfully, for only\r\na single letter serves as a record for the twelvemonth, and that is but\r\na short one addressed to Babbage asking him to look up one or two\r\ngeological matters during a journey through Normandy to Paris. As it is\r\ndated from London on the 11th of August, this looks as if Lyell did not\r\ngo during the summer farther than Scotland, where he presided over the\r\nGeological Section at the meeting of the British Association.[94] The\r\nearlier part of 1841 appears to have been equally uneventful; but the\r\nsummer of that year saw the beginning of a long journey and the opening\r\nof a new geological horizon, for Mr. and Mrs. Lyell crossed the Atlantic\r\non a visit to Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] At King's College and at the Royal Institution. _See_ pp. 71, 72.\r\n\r\n[67] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol. i. p. 401.\r\n\r\n[68] Huxley, \"Man's Place in Nature,\" p. 121.\r\n\r\n[69] Only the skull was found, and that imperfect; moreover, the missing\r\npart could not be discovered.

These\r\nafterwards produced a crop of about twenty papers, which appeared in\r\nvarious scientific periodicals. The principal results and the general\r\nimpressions of the journey were worked up into a book entitled \"Travels\r\nin North America,\" which was published in 1845.\r\n\r\nA geologist who has been trained among the scenery of Britain finds his\r\nfirst view of the Alps to be the beginning of a new chapter in the Book\r\nof Nature, but a visit to America more like the beginning of a new\r\nvolume. There almost everything is on a colossal scale--rivers, lakes,\r\nforests, prairies, distances, such as cannot be matched, at any rate in\r\nthe more accessible parts of Europe. One may read of plains where the\r\nsun rises and sets as from a sea; of lakes, like Superior, as big as\r\nIreland; of falls, like Niagara, where the neighbouring ground never\r\nceases to quiver with the thud of the precipitated water; of rivers well\r\nnigh half a league wide while their waters still are far from the sea.\r\nBut such things must be seen to be realised. In our own island Nature\r\nseems to be working at the present time on a scale comparatively puny;\r\nshe must be watched as she puts forth her full strength before the\r\nadequacy of modern causes can be duly appreciated, and the history of\r\nthe past can be understood by comparing it with that of the present.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to cross the Atlantic hardly could have reached Lyell at\r\na more opportune epoch of his life. In his forty-fourth year, he was in\r\nfull vigour both of mind and of body. A long course of study and of\r\ntravel in Europe had trained him to be a keen observer, had enabled him\r\nto appreciate the significance of phenomena, and had supplied him with\r\nstores of knowledge on which he could draw for the interpretation of\r\ndifficulties. America also offered a splendid field for work. Much of\r\nthe country had been settled and brought under cultivation at no distant\r\ndate; new tracts were being made accessible almost daily. Geologists of\r\nmark were few and far between, so that large areas awaited exploration,\r\nand in many places the traveller found a virgin field. The Geological\r\nSurvey of Canada was just then being organised, the labours of the\r\nNational Survey in the United States had not yet begun, though State\r\nsurveys were at work, and had already borne good fruit. Indeed, while\r\nLyell was in the country, the third meeting of the Association of\r\nAmerican Geologists was held at Boston, and among those present were\r\nseveral men whose names will always occupy an honoured place in the\r\nhistory of the science. Still, at almost every step the observer might\r\nbe rewarded by some discovery or by some fascinating problem which would\r\ngive a direction to his future work.\r\n\r\nThe Lyells left Liverpool on July 20th, 1841, and reached Halifax on the\r\n31st of the month, whence they went on to Boston, arriving there on\r\nAugust 2nd. The close resemblance of the shells scattered on the shore\r\nat the latter place to those in a similar situation in Britain was one\r\nof the first things which Lyell noted; for he found that about one-third\r\nwere actually identical, a large number of the remainder being\r\ngeographical representatives, and only a few affording characteristic or\r\npeculiar forms. For this correspondence, which, as he writes, had a\r\ngeological significance, he was not prepared. The drifts around Boston,\r\ngood sections of which had been exposed in making cuttings for railways,\r\nresembled very closely the deposits which he had seen in Scandinavia.\r\nWere it not, he says, for the distinctness of the plants and of the\r\nbirds, he could have believed himself in Scotland, or in some part of\r\nNorthern Europe. These masses of sand and pebbles, derived generally\r\nfrom the more immediate neighbourhood, though containing sometimes huge\r\nblocks which had travelled from great distances, occasionally exceeded\r\n200 feet in depth. Commonly, however, they were only of a moderate\r\nthickness, and were found to rest upon polished and striated surfaces of\r\ngranite, gneiss, and mica-schist. The latter effects, at any rate, would\r\nnow be generally attributed to the action of land ice, but Lyell thought\r\nthat the great extent of low country, remote from any high mountains,\r\nmade this agent practically impossible, and supposed that the work both\r\nof transport and of attrition had been done during a period of\r\nsubmergence by floating ice and grounding bergs.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days' halt at Boston, they moved on to Newhaven, where\r\nProfessor Silliman showed him dykes and intrusive sheets of columnar\r\ngreenstone altering red sandstone, their general appearance and\r\nassociation recalling Salisbury Crags and other familiar sections near\r\nEdinburgh. In this district Lyell found the grasshoppers as numerous and\r\nas noisy as in Italy, watched the fireflies sparkling in the darkness,\r\nand had his first sight of a humming-bird, and of a wildflower hardly\r\nless gorgeous, the scarlet lobelia.\r\n\r\nFrom Newhaven they went to New York, and up the Hudson River in one of\r\nthe great steamers, past the noble colonnade of basalt called the\r\nPalisades, and along the winding channel through the gneissic hills to\r\nAlbany. Here a geological survey had been established by the State, and\r\nits members had already done good work, which, however, was not\r\naltogether welcome to its employers, for they had dispelled all hopes of\r\nfinding coal within the limits of the State. This, as Lyell says, was a\r\ngreat disappointment to many; but it did good in checking the rashness\r\nof private speculation, and in preventing the waste of the large sums of\r\nmoney which had been annually squandered in trials to find coal in\r\nstrata which really lay below the Carboniferous system. The advantage to\r\nthe revenues of the state by the stoppage of this outlay and the more\r\nprofitable direction given to private enterprise were sufficient, Lyell\r\nremarks, \"to indemnify the country, on mere utilitarian grounds, for\r\nthe sum of more than two hundred thousand dollars so munificently\r\nexpended on geological investigation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Albany Lyell travelled to Niagara. The journey was planned in order\r\nto give him an opportunity of examining a connected series of formations\r\nfrom the base of the Palaeozoic, where it rested on the ancient gneiss,\r\nto the coalfield of Pennsylvania; and he had the great advantage of\r\nbeing accompanied by one of the most eminent of American geologists, Mr.\r\nJames Hall.\r\n\r\n      \"In the course of this third tour,\" Lyell writes,[95] \"I\r\n      became convinced that we must turn to the New World if we\r\n      want to see in perfection the oldest monuments of the\r\n      earth's history, so far as relates to its earliest\r\n      inhabitants. Certainly in no other country are these ancient\r\n      strata developed on a grander scale, or more plentifully\r\n      charged with fossils; and as they are nearly horizontal, the\r\n      order of their relative position is always clear and\r\n      unequivocal. They exhibit, moreover, in their range from the\r\n      Hudson River to the Niagara some fine examples of the\r\n      gradual manner in which certain sets of strata thin out when\r\n      followed for hundreds of miles; while others, previously\r\n      wanting, become intercalated in the series.\"\r\n\r\nHe observed, also, that while some species of the fossils contained in\r\nthese rocks were common to both sides of the Atlantic, the majority were\r\ndifferent; thus disproving the statement which at that time was often\r\nmade--namely, that in the rocks older than the Carboniferous system the\r\nfossil fauna in different parts of the globe was almost everywhere the\r\nsame, and showing that, \"however close the present analogy of forms may\r\nbe, there is evidence of the same law of variation in space as now\r\nprevails in the living creation.\"\r\n\r\nLyell made a thorough study of the Falls of Niagara, to which he paid a\r\nsecond visit before his return to England. The first view of these\r\nFalls, like the first sight of a great snow-clad peak, is one of those\r\nepochs of life of which the memory can never fade. It stirred Lyell to\r\nan unwonted enthusiasm. At the first view, from a distance of about\r\nthree miles, with not a house in sight--it would be impossible, we\r\nthink, to find such a spot now; \"nothing but the greenwood, the falling\r\nwater, and the white foam\"--he thought the falls \"more beautiful but\r\nless grand\" than he had expected; but, after spending some days in the\r\nneighbourhood, now watching the river sweeping onwards to its final\r\nplunge, here in the turmoil of the rapids, there in its gliding, so\r\nsmooth but so irresistible; now gazing at that mighty wall of 'shattered\r\nchrysoprase' and rainbow-tinted spray, which floats up like the steam of\r\nEtna; now looking down from the brink of the crags below the fall upon\r\nthose rapids, where the billows of green water roll and plunge like the\r\nwaves of the ocean, he \"at last learned by degrees to comprehend the\r\nwonders of the scene, and to feel its full magnificence.\"\r\n\r\nBut, keenly as he might be impressed with the poetic grandeur of the\r\nfalls, he could not forget the scientific questions which were ever\r\npresent to his mind. The gorge of Niagara offered a problem for solution\r\nwhich had for him a special fascination. Not only did it illustrate on a\r\ngrand scale the potencies of water in rapid motion, but also it\r\nfurnished data for estimating the period during which this agent had\r\nbeen at work. The gorge has been carved in a plateau of Silurian rock,\r\nwhich terminates, seven miles below the falls, in a precipitous\r\nescarpment overhanging Queenstown. There was a time when that gorge did\r\nnot exist, when the river first took its course along the plateau on its\r\nway from Lake Erie, and plunged over the brink of the escarpment. The\r\nvalley at first was nothing more than a shallow trench excavated in the\r\ndrift which covers the surface of the country--such an one as may still\r\nbe seen between Lake Erie and the falls--but the river, slowly and\r\nsteadily, has cut its way back through the rocky plateau from the first\r\nsite of the falls near Queenstown to their present position. The upper\r\npart of this plateau consists of a thick bed of hard limestone, but\r\nbeneath this the deposits become softer; and the lowest bed is the most\r\nperishable. The water, as it plunges down, undermines the overlying\r\nrock. The gorge began at once to be developed, and it has ever since\r\ncontinued to retreat towards Lake Erie. Every year makes some slight\r\nchange. This becomes more marked when old histories are consulted and\r\nold drawings compared with the present aspect of the scene. Father\r\nHennepin's sketch, of which Lyell gives a copy,[96] rude and incorrect\r\nas it is, proves beyond all question that the changes in the\r\nneighbourhood of Table Rock have been very considerable, for it shows\r\nthat on this side a third and much narrower cascade fell athwart the\r\ngeneral course of the main mass of water. This cascade, by the time of\r\nKalm's[97] visit in 1751, had ceased to be conspicuous, and had quite\r\ndisappeared before the date of Lyell's visit. The Horseshoe Fall also at\r\nthe present time is less worthy of the name than it was at that date,\r\nfor its symmetry has been seriously marred by a deep notch which the\r\nnorthern stream has cut in the more central part of the curve.[98]\r\nCareful inquiry convinced Lyell that the slow recession of the falls was\r\nan indubitable fact, and that its rate, on an average, was about a foot\r\na year. As the gorge is about seven miles long, this would fix its\r\nbeginning about 35,000 years ago.[99]\r\n\r\nFrom Niagara Falls they travelled, still in Mr. Hall's company, by\r\nBuffalo to Geneva, examining on the way some red, green, and bluish-grey\r\nmarls, with beds of gypsum and occasional salt springs, which, though\r\nolder than the coal measures of England, closely resembled in appearance\r\nthe upper part of the New Red Sandstone of Britain. Finally, after\r\ncrossing the outcrops of the Devonian system, they reached Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere Lyell obtained his first view of the coal measures of North\r\nAmerica, and was no less interested than surprised to find how closely\r\nthe whole series corresponded with that of Britain. He saw sandstones\r\n\"such as are used for building in Newcastle or Edinburgh, dark shales\r\noften full of ferns 'spread out as in a herbarium,' beds and nodules of\r\nclay-ironstone, seams of bituminous coal, varying in thickness from a\r\nfew inches to some yards, and, beside these, an underlying coarse grit,\r\npassing down into a conglomerate, which was very like the millstone grit\r\nof England. The underclays beneath the seam of coal were full of stems\r\nand rootlets of Stigmaria, and the sight of these confirmed him in the\r\nopinion that the coal was formed of the remains of plants which had\r\ngrown upon the spot.\"[100] After examining the district, they returned\r\nto Albany, and went thence to New York and Philadelphia, picking up on\r\nthe way as much geological information as was possible.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey afforded some highly interesting sections of rocks belonging\r\nto the Cretaceous system, for these, though in mineral character\r\nresembling the greensands on the eastern side of the Atlantic, contained\r\nfossils which corresponded more closely with those of the white chalk,\r\nsome species being actually identical. This fact was another proof that,\r\nthough there had been in past ages a general similarity in the fauna of\r\nany period, geographical provinces had existed no less than they do at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nLyell had examined, as mentioned above, the bituminous coals in the\r\nundisturbed region of Pennsylvania, the next step was to study the beds\r\nof anthracite, with the associated strata, in the folded and broken\r\nridges of the Alleghany Mountains. In this part of his work he had the\r\ninestimable advantage of being guided by Professor H. O. Rogers, whose\r\nname is inseparably connected with the geology of that classic region.\r\nThe Alleghanies or Appalachians consist of a series of Silurian,\r\nDevonian, and Carboniferous strata in orderly sequence, \"folded\" (to use\r\nLyell's words) \"as if they had been subjected to a great lateral\r\npressure when in a soft and yielding state, large portions having\r\nafterwards been removed by denudation. The long uniform, parallel\r\nridges, with intervening valleys like so many gigantic wrinkles and\r\nfurrows, are in close connection with the geological structure,\" and the\r\nrocks are most disturbed on the south-eastern flank of the chain, where\r\nthe folds sometimes bend over to the west; in other words, the greatest\r\ndisturbances are on the side nearest to the fundamental gneiss and the\r\nbasin of the Atlantic--facts which probably stand in the relation of\r\neffect and cause.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprise to Lyell, on reaching the anthracite district around\r\nPottsville on the Schuylkill, to see \"a flourishing manufacturing town\r\nwith the tall chimneys of a hundred furnaces, burning night and day, yet\r\nquite free from smoke.\" Special contrivances, of course, are requisite\r\nto secure the combustion of anthracite, especially in household\r\nfireplaces, but he had no hesitation in declaring that he preferred the\r\nuse of it, notwithstanding the stove-like heat produced, to that of the\r\nbituminous coal consumed in London, with the penalty of living in an\r\natmosphere dark with smoke and foul with smuts.\r\n\r\nThe seams of anthracite in this district are sometimes worked in\r\nopen-air excavations, but as the strata have been bent into a vertical\r\nposition the beds above and below, when the anthracite has been quarried\r\nout, are left like the walls of a fissure, and thus can be examined\r\nwith the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nHere also the \"roof\" of the seam proved to be a dark shale full of the\r\nusual plant-remains, among which were some British species of ferns, and\r\nthe \"floor\" was an \"underclay\" containing the stems and rootlets of\r\nStigmaria. Lyell also observed that the beds of detrital\r\nmaterials--sandstones, shales, etc.--were less persistent than those of\r\ncoal, and that the way in which the former became thicker towards the\r\nsouth-east indicated that this was the direction of the ancient land\r\nregion from which they had been derived. The result of his examination\r\nsatisfied him that the anthracite of the Appalachians was identical in\r\nage, generally speaking, with the bituminous coal which he had\r\npreviously examined, and was merely a fragment of the great continuous\r\ncoalfield of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio, which lies about forty\r\nmiles away to the westward.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Philadelphia Mr. and Mrs. Lyell went, _via_ New York,\r\nto Boston, where he had been engaged to deliver a course of twelve\r\nlectures on geology at the Lowell Institute. To the courses here\r\nadmission was free, but the tickets were given under certain\r\nrestrictions. For Lyell's lectures about 4,500 were issued, and the\r\nclass, he states, usually consisted of more than 3,000 persons. It had\r\ntherefore to be sub-divided and each lecture to be repeated. The\r\naudience was composed \"of persons of both sexes, of every station in\r\nsociety, from the most affluent and eminent in the various learned\r\nprofessions to the humblest mechanics, all well-dressed, and observing\r\nthe utmost decorum.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the lectures the Lyells travelled southwards, so\r\nthat he might take advantage of the more genial climate and continue his\r\ngeological work in the open air. He first halted at Richmond in\r\nVirginia, and from that place visited the Tertiary deposits in the\r\nvicinity of the James River. The more interesting of these are of\r\nMiocene age, and he observed that the fossils of Maryland and Virginia\r\nresembled those of Touraine and the neighbourhood of Bordeaux more\r\nclosely than those from the coralline Crag of Suffolk, especially in the\r\npresence of genera indicative of a warm climate.\r\n\r\nFrom this place they travelled across the \"pine barrens\"--where their\r\ntrain was stopped for the night by the slippery condition of the\r\nrails--to Weldon in North Carolina. Here Lyell saw the Great Dismal\r\nSwamp, a morass which extends for about forty miles from the\r\nneighbourhood of this town to Norfolk in Virginia. Like the bogs of\r\nIreland, this marshy plain, some five-and-twenty miles across, is rather\r\nhigher at the middle than at the edges. Its surface \"is carpeted with\r\nmosses, and densely covered with ferns and reeds, above which many\r\nevergreen shrubs and trees flourish, especially the white cedar\r\n(_Cupressus thyoides_), which stands firmly supported by its long\r\ntap-roots in the softest parts of the quagmire. Over the whole, the\r\ndeciduous cypress (_Taxodium distichum_) is seen to tower with its\r\nspreading top, in full leaf, in the season when the sun's rays are\r\nhottest, and when, if not interrupted by a screen of foliage, they might\r\nsoon cause the fallen leaves and dead plants of the preceding autumn to\r\ndecompose, instead of adding their contributions to the peaty mass. On\r\nthe surface of the whole morass lie innumerable trunks of large and\r\ntall trees, blown down by the winds, while thousands of others are\r\nburied at various depths in the black mire below. They remind the\r\ngeologist of the prostrate position of large stems of Sigillaria and\r\nLepidodendron, converted into coal in ancient Carboniferous rocks.\"[101]\r\n\r\nAt Charleston they had practically passed beyond the southern limit of\r\nthe winter snowfall, the greatest enemy of the field-geologist, and\r\ncould carry on work without fear of interruption. Here they found\r\nflowers \"at the end of December still lingering in the gardens,\" and\r\nwere in the region of the palmetto palm. Few things during this rather\r\nlengthy journey impressed Lyell more than the facility of locomotion in\r\na district which, comparatively speaking, was a new settlement, and was\r\nstill in places thinly peopled, together with the general good quality\r\nof the accommodation for travellers. In this respect they had fared much\r\nworse during the previous year, when they were travelling through some\r\nof the more populous parts of France, such as Touraine and Brittany.\r\nAfter a journey through the pinewoods, they reached Augusta in Georgia,\r\nwhere another group of Tertiary deposits invited a halt. Those belonging\r\nto the Eocene period lie further down the Savannah River, so that a\r\njourney was made for the purpose of examining them, in the course of\r\nwhich, near the town of the same name as the river, Lyell also saw the\r\nclay in which remains of the mastodon and of other extinct mammals had\r\nbeen found. The muddy beach, with the tracks of racoons and opossums,\r\ngave him some hints as to the history of fossil footprints, so that on\r\nthe whole very much interesting geology was the reward of a three weeks'\r\nstay in South Carolina. Then they once more turned their faces\r\nnorthward, and made their way, working at geology as they went, to\r\nPhiladelphia, where they found themselves again in the region of colder\r\nwinters at the present, and of erratic boulders as memorials of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nSix weeks were spent in Philadelphia, but Lyell's time was largely taken\r\nup by the delivery of a short course of lectures on geology.\r\nPennsylvania, however, added to his experiences in another way, for the\r\nstate had passed through a commercial crisis, and was unable to pay the\r\ninterest on its funded debt. The soreness produced by this repudiation\r\nwill not be readily forgotten, for nearly two-thirds of the stock--the\r\nwhole amount of which was eight millions sterling--was held by British\r\nowners, so that the loss was felt heavily on this side of the Atlantic.\r\nIn his \"Travels\" Lyell gives a brief history of this transaction, and\r\ndiscusses the political causes of a crisis which had been hardly less\r\ndisastrous in America than in England.\r\n\r\nThey reached New York in the month of March, and spent several weeks\r\nthere, for in that neighbourhood both the ancient crystalline rocks and\r\nthe modern drift, with its erratics, afforded Lyell ample materials for\r\nstudy, each of these being then reckoned (and they have not ceased to be\r\nso counted) among the most difficult questions of geology. Towards the\r\nmiddle of April he proceeded northward, in order to examine the\r\nperplexing schists and less altered sedimentary deposits of the Taconic\r\nrange, rocks which from that time to this have given ample employment to\r\ngeologists. After this he found an opportunity of making use of the\r\nlessons learnt on the flats by the James River, for he went to\r\nSpringfield and examined the famous footprints in the sandstone of\r\nConnecticut. As the deposit was referred to the Trias, and the\r\nfootprints to birds, they were supposed to indicate the existence of\r\nthis class of the animal kingdom at the beginning of the Secondary era.\r\nThey have, however, now lost their special interest, since they are\r\ngenerally assigned to reptiles. After the middle of April was past, the\r\ntravellers again reached Boston, from which city an excursion was made\r\nin order to study the Tertiary deposits of the island called Martha's\r\nVineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nReturning to Philadelphia early in May, they went by Baltimore westward\r\nto the valley of the Ohio, in order to examine the undisturbed country\r\nbeyond the folded district of the Alleghany Mountains. By this journey\r\nanother section was, in fact, run across the great coalfield of the\r\nEastern States, but considerably to the south of that which had been\r\nexamined in the autumn of the preceding year. This proved no less\r\ninteresting than the former one. At Brownsville, to take one instance\r\nonly, a seam of bituminous coal, ten feet in thickness, was seen\r\ncropping out in the river cliff by the side of a large tributary of the\r\nOhio, where it was worked by horizontal galleries. Pittsburg and other\r\ninteresting localities in the neighbourhood were also visited, and then\r\nthe Lyells descended the Ohio River to Cincinnati. He had thus traversed\r\nin descending order the succession of strata from the Carboniferous to\r\nthe Lower Silurian or Ordovician system, which is exposed in the\r\nneighbourhood of that town. This, however, was not the only attraction\r\noffered by Cincinnati. Some two-and-twenty miles distant is the famous\r\nBig Bone Lick in Kentucky. Here some saline springs break out on a\r\nnearly level and boggy river plain, which are still attractive to wild\r\nanimals, and often in past time lured them to their death in the\r\nadjacent quagmires. Here the bones of the mastodon and the elephant, of\r\nthe megalonyx, stag, horse, and bison, have all been found, some in\r\ngreat numbers; and the last-named animals had frequented the springs\r\nwithin the memory of persons who were living at the time of Lyell's\r\nvisit. These bones are generally embedded in a black mud, at a depth of\r\nabout a dozen feet below the surface of the creek. Lyell suggests that\r\nvery probably the heavy mastodons and elephants were lost by shoving one\r\nanother off the tracks and into the more marshy ground as they struggled\r\nto satisfy themselves at the springs; just as horses, cattle, and deer\r\nget pushed into the stream in thronging to the rivers on the pampas of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nFrom Cincinnati the travellers struck northward to Cleveland on Lake\r\nErie, going across a region which at that time was still being cleared\r\nand settled, and getting an experience of that American form of\r\ntravellers' torture called a corduroy road. The lake-ridges--curious\r\nmounds or terraces of water-worn materials--in the neighbourhood of\r\nCleveland afforded a new subject for an investigation which was\r\ncontinued in the vicinity of Ontario. But before reaching this lake\r\nLyell spent a week at the Falls of Niagara, revising and enlarging the\r\nwork already done. During the time he investigated the buried channel\r\nwhich appears to lead from the whirlpool to St. Davids, a league or so\r\nto the west of Queenstown. This was supposed by Lyell and many\r\nsubsequent geologists to indicate part of an old course of the St.\r\nLawrence, which had afterwards been blocked up by glacial drifts. It is,\r\nhowever, according to Professor J. W. Spencer, only a branch of a buried\r\nvalley, outside the Niagara canyon and much shallower than it, which has\r\nbeen cut through by the present St. Lawrence, and has merely produced an\r\nelongation of the chasm at the Whirlpool.[102] Another series of\r\nlake-ridges was examined in the neighbourhood of Toronto. Here Lyell\r\ntraced them to a height of 680 feet above the level of Ontario, seeing\r\nin all no less than eleven, some of them much reminding him of the oesar\r\nwhich he had examined in Sweden. In regard to these lake-ridges he\r\nwrites thus:--\r\n\r\n      With the exception of the parallel roads or shelves of\r\n      Glenroy and some neighbouring glens of the Western Highlands\r\n      in Scotland, I never saw so remarkable an example of banks,\r\n      terraces, and accumulations of stratified sand and gravel,\r\n      maintaining, over wide areas, so perfect a horizontality, as\r\n      in the district north of Toronto.[103]\r\n\r\nLeaving Toronto on June 18th, they descended the St. Lawrence to\r\nMontreal and Quebec. The neighbourhood of either town afforded\r\nopportunities for much interesting work, especially in the drift\r\ndeposits; the underlying ice-worn surfaces of crystalline or Palaeozoic\r\nrock reminding Lyell of what he had seen in Scandinavia. At Montreal,\r\nthe great hill, which gives its name to the town built upon its lower\r\nslopes, affords some highly interesting sections. It is composed of\r\nPalaeozoic limestone, which has been pierced by more than one mass of\r\ncoarsely crystalline intrusive rock and cleft by many dykes of a more\r\ncompact character. Near the junction with the larger intrusive masses\r\nthe limestone becomes conspicuously crystalline, and the fossils\r\ndisappear, just as in the cases which Lyell had already seen about the\r\nborder of granite in Scandinavia. Some also of the igneous rocks now\r\npossess a further interest, for they contain nepheline, a mineral not\r\nvery common. This, however, had not been recognised at the time of\r\nLyell's visit. The limestone in some of the quarries is wonderfully\r\nice-worn, and the overlying drifts are in many ways remarkable. Of these\r\ndrifts, Lyell examined various sections, at heights of from 60 to 200\r\nfeet above the St. Lawrence, finding plenty of sea-shells,[104] the\r\ncommon mussel being in one place especially abundant. He also examined\r\nsome sections of stratified drifts between Montreal and Quebec, but\r\nwithout obtaining any fossils, though they had been found by Captain\r\nBayford and others. The drifts, however, near the latter city were more\r\nprolific. With their shells, indeed, he was already, to some extent,\r\nfamiliar, for in the year 1835 he had received a collection from Captain\r\nBayford. This happened to reach London at a time when Dr. Beck of\r\nCopenhagen was with him, and \"great was our surprise,\" he writes, \"on\r\nopening the box to find that nearly all the shells agreed specifically\r\nwith fossils which, in the summer of the preceding year, I had obtained\r\nat Uddevalla in Sweden.\" The most abundant species were still living in\r\nnorthern seas, some in those of Greenland and other high latitudes;\r\nwhile in Sweden they were found fossil between latitudes 58 deg. and 60\r\ndeg. N., and here in latitude 47 deg. These fossil shells occur at\r\nBeaufort, about a league below Quebec, and about a quarter of a mile from\r\nthe river, in deposits which have filled an old ravine in the Palaeozoic\r\nrock. A laminated clay forms the lowest bed, above which comes a stratified\r\nsand, and this is followed by a clay containing boulders, each of these\r\ndeposits being about twenty-five feet thick. They are without fossils,\r\nwhich begin with the next bed, a stratified mass of pebbly sand and\r\nloam, and become more frequent, till at last this passes into a mass\r\nnearly twelve feet thick, consisting almost wholly of the well-known\r\nbivalve _Saxicava rugosa_. This deposit was about 150 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. Afterwards, in travelling southwards from Montreal,\r\nwhither he returned from Quebec, Lyell found marine shells on the border\r\nof Lake Champlain, about eighty miles from the former town. Here they\r\noccurred in a loam, which was covered by a sand, and rested on a clay\r\nabout thirty feet thick, containing boulders, some of them nine feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nLyell sums up the results of his investigations by stating that, in his\r\nopinion, the shells certainly belong to the same geological period as do\r\nthe boulders, and occur both above and below beds containing erratics;\r\nwhile the fundamental rocks below the drift are \"smoothed and furrowed\r\non the surface by glacial action.\" This effect Lyell at that time\r\nattributed to the friction of bergs grounding as they floated, but it is\r\nnow referred by the majority of geologists to the action of land ice. Be\r\nthis, however, as it may, the shell-bearing beds must have been\r\ndeposited in the sea; so that either the land must have sunk as the ice\r\nretreated, or the latter at the time of its greatest extension must have\r\ntrespassed on the domain of the sea, as it still does around parts of\r\nthe Antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nFrom Montreal they went, by way of Lake Champlain and over the Green\r\nMountains, to Boston, where they arrived about the middle of July, and\r\nproceeded by steamer to Halifax. Here began the last stage of Lyell's\r\njourney, the examination of the Carboniferous system in Nova Scotia, to\r\nwhich work a full month was devoted. After studying the gypsum, red\r\nmarl, and sandstone of the lower part of that system, which bears some\r\nresemblance to the Upper Trias (Keuper) of Britain, he crossed the Bay\r\nof Mines to Minudie, in the heart of the Nova Scotian coalfield. The\r\ncliffs by the sea-shore exhibit a fine series of sections, from the\r\ngypseous rocks up to the coal measures, uninterrupted by faults, the\r\nbeds dipping steadily at an angle of nearly 30 deg. Sandstones, shales,\r\nand seams of coal could be seen alternating in the usual manner; and from\r\nthe last-named, stumps of trees, sometimes two or three yards high, were\r\nseen in places, as at South Joggins, projecting at right angles to the\r\nsurface of the bed. Of such stems he observed at least seventeen at ten\r\ndifferent levels. The stumps never pierced a coal-seam, but always\r\nterminated downwards either in it or in shale, and never in sandstone,\r\nthus indicating that they were a part of the vegetation from which the\r\ncoal had been formed, and that it, like a peat-bog in England, required\r\na subsoil impervious to water. Lyell also mentions that Mr. (now Sir) J.\r\nW. Dawson, who was his companion for part of the time, had found a bed\r\nof calamites in a similar position of growth.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to much interesting work in various parts of the Nova\r\nScotian coalfield, Lyell had the opportunity of witnessing the noted\r\ntides of the Bay of Fundy, where the difference between high and low\r\nwater is as great as, if not greater than, anywhere else on the globe.\r\nOn the muddy flats thus left bare he had another opportunity of studying\r\nthe tracks left by various animals, marine and terrestrial; and in\r\nwatching how these were hardened by the action of the sun, if they had\r\nbeen made near the high-water mark of spring-tides, he gained further\r\nhints for interpreting the fossil footprints of Connecticut and other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August the Lyells left Halifax for England, thus bringing\r\nto a close a year of assiduous field-work, long journeys, and varied\r\nexperiences. It was a period of the most continuous outdoor labour, and\r\nthus the most fruitful in the acquisition of knowledge which he had\r\nspent since his marriage and the publication of the \"Principles of\r\nGeology\"--a period comparable only with his journey, between May, 1828,\r\nand February, 1829, in France, Italy, and Sicily, though it was still\r\nlonger and more fruitful, were this possible, in varied geological\r\nexperiences. He had not, indeed, seen in this part of America any\r\nvolcanoes, active or extinct--of which, however, he had already examined\r\nplenty; but he had studied good and characteristic sections of almost\r\nevery formation which occurred in the more eastern states of America,\r\nfrom the most ancient crystalline masses, the foundation stones of the\r\ncontinent, to the most recent fossiliferous drifts. He had travelled\r\nfrom a region which resembled Scandinavia to one where the climate was\r\nmore like that of the north coast of Africa, and had enlarged his\r\nconceptions of the scale on which Nature worked. But, in addition, he\r\nhad been afforded an opportunity of studying the social and political\r\ncondition of a young and vigorous nation as it was developing,\r\nunfettered by antiquated laws and hereditary customs. To this aspect of\r\nthe tour a brief reference will be made in a later chapter; now it is\r\nenough to say that the long journeying of the twelvemonth had been\r\nhappily ended, without illness, without the slightest accident, without\r\nanything that could be called an adventure. This good fortune followed\r\nthem to the very end, for even the homeward passage is dismissed with\r\nthe brief remark that it took nine days and sixteen hours; so that it\r\nmay be supposed to have been prosperously uneventful. Then in eight\r\nhours after leaving Liverpool the travellers were back once more in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[95] \"Travels in North America,\" chap. i.\r\n\r\n[96] \"Travels in North America,\" chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[97] See the plate in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, 1751.\r\n\r\n[98] See map in \"Man and the Glacial Period,\" by Dr. G. F. Wright\r\n(International Scientific Series), p. 338.\r\n\r\n[99] The estimates made by geologists have varied from 55,000 years\r\n(Ellicott, in 1790) to not more than 7,000 years (United States\r\nGeological Survey, 1886). Professor J. W. Spencer, who has recently\r\ninvestigated the question, has arrived, by a different method, at a date\r\npractically identical with that assigned by Lyell (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol.\r\nlvi. (1894), p. 145).\r\n\r\n[100] This was still a moot point with geologists. Lyell refers to the\r\nconfirmatory evidence which W. Logan had recently obtained in the South\r\nWales coalfield of Britain.\r\n\r\n[101] \"Principles of Geology,\" chap. xliv.\r\n\r\n[102] Proc. Roy. Soc. lvi.

They are found to vary somewhat in level, thus\r\nindicating unequal movements of the earth's crust. References to\r\nliterature prior to 1890 will be found in a paper by Professor J.

They occur\r\nup to 560 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nANOTHER EPOCH OF WORK AND TRAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery soon after their arrival in England the travellers went north to\r\nKinnordy, where they remained till the end of October, when they\r\nreturned again to their London home. Such an accumulation of specimens\r\nand of notes as had been gathered in America made necessary a long\r\nperiod of labour indoors, unpacking, classifying, and arranging; while\r\ncertain groups of fossils had to be repacked and sent to friends, who\r\nhad undertaken to work them out. These occupations apparently detained\r\nLyell in London till August, 1843, when he started for Ireland,\r\nindulging himself on the way with a short run in Somersetshire for some\r\ngeological work around Bath and Bristol, examining more particularly the\r\n\"dolomitic conglomerate,\" a shore deposit of Keuper age, in which the\r\nremains of saurians had been found, and the Radstock Collieries, where\r\nhe spent more than five hours underground \"traversing miles of galleries\r\nin the coal,\" and finding here, as he had done in America, the stumps of\r\ntrees in an upright position and shales full of fossil ferns as \"roofs\"\r\nto the seams. Then, in company with Mrs. Lyell, he crossed over to Cork,\r\nwhere the British Association assembled on August 17th, under the\r\npresidency of the late Earl of Rosse. The meeting was well attended by\r\nscientific men, but was coldly received by the neighbourhood and\r\ncounty--partly, as Lyell says, because the gentry cared little for\r\nscience; partly because the townspeople, comprising many rich merchants\r\nand most of the tradesmen, were \"Repealers\"; \"and, the agitation having\r\noccurred since we were invited, the opposite parties could never, in\r\nIreland, act or pull together.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to visit Cork without seeing the beauties of the lakes\r\nand mountains of Killarney; and after this a short stay was made at Birr\r\nCastle, Lord Rosse's pleasant home at Parsonstown. The huge reflecting\r\ntelescope, which is now more than a local wonder, was not then\r\ncompleted; but the smaller one, itself on a gigantic scale, was in full\r\nworking order, and already had led to grand results by \"not only\r\nreducing nebulae into clusters of distinct stars, but by showing that the\r\nregular geometric figures in which they presented themselves to\r\nHerschel, when viewed with a glass of less power, disappear and become\r\nvery much like parts of the Milky Way.\" Thence they went northward to\r\nthe coast of Antrim, to see the waves breaking upon the colonnades of\r\nbasalt at the Giant's Causeway, and the dykes of that rock cutting\r\nthrough and altering the white chalk. Evidently the geology proved\r\ninteresting, as well it might, for here Nature presents a volume of her\r\ngeological history, that of the Secondary era, with only the opening and\r\nthe concluding chapters, all the record from the early part of the Lias\r\nto the beginning of the Cretaceous having been torn out. The dark-tinted\r\ngreensand, changing almost immediately into the pure white chalk, often\r\npresents curious colour-contrasts in a single section; while the\r\nclassification of the several deposits offered a problem at which\r\nprobably Lyell thought it wiser to \"look and pass on.\" Several of the\r\nmore interesting facts observed during this trip were afterwards\r\ndescribed in the \"Elements of Geology,\"[105] among them the beds of\r\nlignite which occur in Antrim, associated with the great flows of\r\nbasalt. Somewhat similar deposits were found, about seven years later,\r\nat Ardtun, in Mull, by the Duke of Argyll--a discovery which led Lyell\r\nto suggest, in later editions of the above-named work, the probability\r\nthat the basalts of Antrim and of the Inner Hebrides were of the same\r\ngeological age,--an inference which since then has been abundantly\r\nconfirmed by the researches of Professor Judd and other geologists.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting sections in Scotland faces Antrim. Here, on\r\nthe Ayrshire coast, between Girvan and Ballantrae, a complex of several\r\nkinds of igneous rock and a region, not a little disturbed, of\r\n\"greywackes\" and other sedimentary deposits present the geologist with\r\nproblems more than sufficiently perplexing. At these Lyell took the\r\nopportunity of glancing, but a day's trip afforded no opportunity for\r\nany serious attempt to read the riddle. That had to be left to a later\r\ngeneration, and so it remained for over forty years. Something is now\r\nknown about the igneous rocks, though here work still remains to be\r\ndone; and the sedimentary deposits have been brought into order by the\r\nlabours of Professor Lapworth. They exhibit, according to his\r\ndescription,[106] an ascending succession from the Llandeilo to the\r\nLlandovery group, and appear to be more modern than some, if not all, of\r\nthe above-named igneous rocks. After their brief halt in this district\r\nthe Lyells went on to Forfarshire, and spent the rest of the autumn at\r\nKinnordy.\r\n\r\nThe winter was a busy time; he was writing steadily at his \"Travels in\r\nNorth America,\" and working up some of the more distinctly scientific\r\nnotes into formal papers for the Geological and other societies. Thus\r\noccupied, more than a year slipped away, diversified only by a summer\r\nvisit to Scotland, attending the meeting of the British Association at\r\nYork, and a journey to the Haswell Colliery, Durham, together with\r\nFaraday, as commissioners to examine into the cause of a recent\r\ndisastrous explosion, and see whether such accidents could be prevented.\r\nWork at the \"Travels in North America\" took up all Lyell's spare time\r\nduring the winter, and the book was published in the earlier part of\r\n1845.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few months old when Mr. and Mrs. Lyell again set off for\r\nanother tour in America. They left Liverpool on September 4th, and\r\nlanded at Halifax on the 17th, after a voyage diversified agreeably by\r\nthe sight of an iceberg and disagreeably by two gales. They went on at\r\nonce to Boston, and thence made a tour through the State of Maine.\r\nDuring this sundry masses of drift were examined, which rested on\r\npolished and grooved surfaces of crystalline rock, and contained the\r\nusual shells, astarte, cardium, nucula, saxicava, etc., and in some\r\nplaces a fossil fish[107] in concretionary nodules. At Portland similar\r\nshells had been found in drifts which also contained bones both of the\r\nbison and of the walrus. These drifts in some places attained a\r\nthickness of 170 feet, and in them valleys 70 feet deep had been\r\nexcavated by streams. Then they went to the White Mountains, and on\r\napproaching them Lyell did not fail to notice \"on the low granite hills\r\nmany angular fragments of that rock, fifteen to twenty feet in diameter,\r\nresting on heaps of sand.\" On their way they came to the Willey Slide,\r\nwhere a whole family of that name had been killed nineteen years\r\npreviously in a landslip. Lyell carefully examined the scene of the\r\naccident, in order to ascertain what effects were produced by a mass of\r\nmud and stones as it slid over a face of rock, and found that it only\r\nmade short scratches and grooves, not long and straight furrows, like\r\nthose left by a glacier. They halted at Fabyan's Hotel near Mount\r\nWashington, and after waiting for a favourable day reached the summit\r\n(6,225 feet above the sea) on October 7th. It is easily accessible on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nThe notes of this excursion among the mountains show that Lyell still\r\nretained his old liking for natural history in general, for they contain\r\nremarks on the flowers, the insects, and the birds. Some observations on\r\nthe Alpine flora of the higher summits in the White Mountains indicate\r\nhis position at that time in regard to the origin of species. He adopts\r\nthe hypothesis of 'specific centres,' viz. that \"each species had its\r\norigin in a single birthplace and spread gradually from its original\r\ncentre to all accessible spots, fit for its habitation, by means of the\r\npower of migration given it from the first.\" He supposed that the plants\r\ncommon to the more arctic regions and to the higher ground further south\r\nin Europe and Northern America were dispersed by floating ice during the\r\nglacial epoch, when the ground stood at a lower level, and that\r\nafterwards, when the climate became warmer, they gradually mounted up\r\nthe slopes of the hills. The possibility of a migration by land is not\r\nmentioned, though doubtless it would have been admitted, because the\r\nevidence which he had so often studied pointed rather to a downward than\r\nto an upward movement but he asserts with some emphasis that many living\r\nspecies are older than the existing distribution of sea and land.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Boston, he had other opportunities of studying ice-worn\r\nrocks and erratics, and from this city made an excursion to Plymouth\r\n(Massachusetts) to see the spot where, on a mid-winter day, the Pilgrim\r\nFathers had landed. But even here he could not neglect the shells upon\r\nthe strand, and he records that eighteen species were collected,\r\none-third of which were common to Europe. Still, we may note that on\r\nthis journey rather more attention was paid than on the former to\r\nquestions political, commercial, educational, and theological, and these\r\noccupy a larger space in the \"Second Visit to the United States,\" which\r\nmay account for its greater popularity. For example, it contains a\r\nsketch of the witch-finding mania in Massachusetts late in the\r\nseventeenth century, and a whole chapter on the sea-serpent. This \"hardy\r\nperennial\" had appeared in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the previous\r\nAugust and in October, 1844,[108] and had repeatedly visited the New\r\nEngland coast from 1815 to 1825, when it had been seen by many credible\r\nwitnesses. Lyell appears to be satisfied that, though allowance had to\r\nbe made for exaggeration and honest misconception, some big creature\r\nhad been seen, and suggests that it may have been an exceptionally large\r\nspecimen of the basking shark.[109]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of nearly two months in Boston, they left for the south\r\nearly in December, and found a little difficulty at first, as on a\r\nformer occasion, from the slippery state of the rails. They journeyed by\r\nNewhaven, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington to Richmond, where a\r\nhalt was made to examine the coalfield some sixteen miles to the\r\nsouth-west of the city. The measures rest on the granite, filling up\r\ninequalities on its surface, and are occasionally cut by dykes, which\r\nproduce the usual alteration in the adjacent coal. The principal seam is\r\nfrom thirty to forty feet thick but the field, as a whole, reminded\r\nLyell most of that at St. Etienne (France), which he had visited in\r\n1843.[110] From Richmond they went, as on the former occasion, by Weldon\r\nto Wilmington, where the cliffs near the town yielded some Tertiary\r\nfossils, and on Christmas morning they landed from a steamer at\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nFrom this city Lyell again visited the deposits near Savannah, which\r\ncontained remains of megatherium, mastodon, and other large quadrupeds,\r\nas well as a second locality on Skiddaway Island, and then, on the last\r\nday of the year, quitted Charleston for Darien in Georgia. Here also\r\nwere some more deposits of the same kind, while at St. Simon's Island\r\nLyell examined a very large Indian mound. It was a mass of shells,\r\nchiefly of oysters, and contained flint arrow-heads, stone axes, and\r\nfragments of Indian pottery.\r\n\r\nReturning to Savannah, they travelled towards the north-west, by Macon\r\nto Milledgeville. For more than 150 miles of the first part of the\r\njourney Lyell went along the railway on a hand-car, so as to study the\r\ncuttings and obtain the most continuous section possible of the Tertiary\r\ndeposits from the sea to the inland granite. These deposits consisted of\r\nporcelain clays, yellow and white sands, and \"burrstone,\" a flinty grit\r\nused for millstones, which often was full of silicified shells and\r\ncorals, with the teeth of sharks and the bones of zeuglodon. Lyell\r\nmentions that in the neighbourhood of Macon he saw blockhouses such as\r\nthose described by Cooper in the \"Pathfinder,\" which twenty-five years\r\nearlier had been used for defence against the Indians before any white\r\nmen's houses had been built in the forest.\r\n\r\nNear Milledgeville the granite, gneiss, etc., is decomposed _in situ_ to\r\na considerable depth, and the rain-water, when the trees have been cut\r\ndown, quickly furrows the detrital deposits of the neighbourhood. A\r\nremarkable instance of this action had occurred at Pomona Farm, where a\r\nravine 180 feet broad and 55 feet deep had been excavated in the course\r\nof only twenty years.[111] From Milledgeville they returned to Macon,\r\nand thence travelled westward by Columbus to Montgomery, being much\r\njolted in the stage-coach, but securing as a reward some Tertiary\r\nfossils; and at the latter place they found red clays and sandstones,\r\nwhich, however, were about the same age as the chalk of England. After\r\nthe coach travelling, a journey by steamer down the Alabama River to\r\nMobile was a welcome change, and the not unfrequent halts for cargo or\r\nto take in wood gave opportunities for collecting fossils from the\r\nneighbouring bluffs. One night they were startled by loud crashing\r\nnoises and the sound of breaking glass, and found that the steamer had\r\nrun foul of the trees growing on the bank. Their branches touched the\r\nwater, as the river was unusually high; and the vessel, in the darkness,\r\nhad been steered too near to the shore. Longer halts were made at\r\nClaiborne, to collect fossils from deposits corresponding in age with\r\nthose at Bracklesham in England; and at Macon (Alabama) to visit a place\r\nwhere some remarkable specimens of the zeuglodon had been discovered.\r\nFrom Mobile also a long river journey was undertaken to Tuscaloosa, to\r\nvisit a coalfield which supplied the town with fuel and the materials\r\nfor gas. The field, \"a southern prolongation of the great Appalachian\r\ncoalfield,\" is a large one, being about ninety miles long and thirty\r\nwide, with some seams sixteen feet thick worked in open quarries. He\r\nremarks that he made geological excursions \"through forests recently\r\nabandoned by the Indians, and where their paths may still be traced.\"\r\n\r\nThe strata on the Alabama River afforded a useful lesson on the\r\nvariability of lithological characters. Were it not for the fossils,\r\nLyell says, the Lower Cretaceous beds of loose gravel might be taken for\r\nthe newest Tertiary, the main body of the Chalk for Lias, and the soft\r\nTertiary limestone for the representative of the Chalk. It was\r\nimpossible to leave Mobile without seeing something of the Gulf of\r\nMexico; so they went in a steamer down the Alabama River to the seaside,\r\nlooked upon the muddy banks, with the shells[112] which live in them and\r\nthe quantities of drift-timber which bestrew them, and then went across\r\nto one of the minor mouths of the Mississippi, and, passing up it,\r\nlanded at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThis town, about 110 miles by water from the confluence of the main\r\nchannel of the Mississippi with the sea, afforded a convenient\r\nopportunity for studying the character of the lower part of the delta of\r\nthe \"Father of Waters.\" Such a region might be expected to supply facts\r\nwhich would be helpful in the interpretation of many phenomena presented\r\nby the coal measures. Accordingly, Lyell made one excursion to Lake\r\nPontchartrain, a great sheet of fresh water no great distance from both\r\nNew Orleans and the sea, and another down to the mouth of the\r\nMississippi. The road through the swamp to the former was constructed of\r\na strange material--viz. the white valves of a freshwater mollusc.[113]\r\nThese are obtained from a huge bank over a mile in length, and sometimes\r\nabout four yards in depth, at one end of the lake. How this had been\r\nformed seemed doubtful. Possibly the shells had been piled up by the\r\nwaves during a storm; possibly there had been some slight change of\r\nlevel. The lake itself is about fifteen feet below high-water mark, and\r\nis about as many deep; but, as it receives an arm of the Mississippi,\r\nsilt is gradually raising the bottom. The sea sometimes, when impelled\r\nby a strong south-east wind, makes its way into the lake. Among the\r\nEnglish coal measures--as, for instance, at Coalbrook Dale or in\r\nYorkshire--beds of marine shells are occasionally found intercalated\r\namong or even associated with freshwater molluscs, without any\r\nalteration in the general character of the beds in which they lie. How\r\nthis might occur is illustrated by Lake Pontchartrain in the swampy\r\nalluvial delta. Here a very slight physical change might enable the sea\r\nto take, for a time, possession of the land, and the denizens of its\r\nwater, like a band of pirates, to dispossess the usual inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe other expedition also supplied not a few valuable facts relating to\r\nthe history of river deltas, which were afterwards supplemented as they\r\ntravelled northwards for some hundreds of miles up the river, following\r\nits sinuous course through leagues of marshy plain, densely overgrown\r\nwith vegetation. In the seaward reaches, reed, and rush, and willow, but\r\nabove New Orleans cypresses and other timber trees, rise above the rank\r\nherbage.\r\n\r\nThe minor channels, blocked with driftwood which formed natural rafts;\r\nthe sand-bars and mud-banks; the great curves of the river, the\r\n\"bayous\"[114] and isolated pools; the natural banks built up by the\r\nsediment arrested at flood-time by the herbage near the river brink; the\r\nfloating timber and the \"snags\"--all provided valuable illustrations of\r\nthe physical features of a great river delta, and supplied him with\r\nmaterial which afterwards was worked up into newer editions of the\r\n\"Principles\" and the \"Elements.\"\r\n\r\nFrom New Orleans Lyell went by steamer to Natchez, halting on the way to\r\nexamine more closely certain localities of interest and to obtain\r\nillustrations of how a coalfield might be formed. The bluffs of\r\nNatchez--almost the first place where distinctly higher ground\r\napproaches the river-side--afforded plenty of semi-fossil shells,\r\nspecifically identical with those still inhabiting the valley of the\r\nMississippi, but the loam in which they were embedded--a loam which\r\nreminded him of the loess of the Rhine--also contains the remains of the\r\nmastodon, and overlies a clay with bones of the megalonyx, horse, and\r\nother quadrupeds, mostly extinct. Beneath this clay are sands and\r\ngravel, the whole forming a platform which rises about 200 feet above\r\nthe low river plain, revealing an earlier chapter in the history of the\r\nriver. Similar bluffs occur at Vicksburg, but these disclosed Eocene\r\nstrata beneath the alluvial deposits, and thus invited a halt in order\r\nto explore the neighbourhood. The next stage was to Memphis, nearly 400\r\nmiles. Lyell speaks highly of the accommodation generally afforded by\r\nthe river steamers, but found the inquisitiveness of his American\r\nfellow-travellers rather a nuisance, and the spoiled children a still\r\ngreater one. The former drawback to pleasure has certainly abated during\r\nthe last half-century, but whether the latter has done the same may\r\nperhaps be disputed. New Madrid, 170 miles above Memphis, called for a\r\nlonger halt, for the neighbouring district had suffered from a great\r\nearthquake in the year 1811, when shocks were felt at intervals for\r\nabout three months, the ground was cracked, water mingled with sand was\r\nspouted out, yawning fissures opened (in one case draining a lake),\r\nportions of the river cliff were shaken down into the stream, and a\r\nlarge district--about 2,000 square miles in area--was permanently\r\ndepressed. Some traces of the earthquake, in addition to the last-named,\r\ncould still be recognised at the time of Lyell's visit, though more than\r\nthirty years had elapsed.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo, above New Madrid, the Ohio joins the Mississippi, and it was\r\nascended to Mount Vernon. The geology now became a little more varied,\r\nfor beneath the shelly loam already mentioned Carboniferous strata make\r\ntheir appearance, in which fossil plants are sometimes abundant and\r\nupright trees now and then occur. For nearly 200 miles higher up the\r\nOhio, rocks of this age are exposed at intervals, till at last, near\r\nLouisville, those belonging to the Devonian system rise from beneath\r\nthem. These, at New Albany, contain a fossil coral-reef, exposed in the\r\nbed of the river and crowded with specimens in unusually good\r\npreservation. At Cincinnati the travellers came at last upon old ground,\r\nand journeyed thence by steamer to Pittsburg. About thirty-two miles\r\nfrom this town, at a place called Greensburg, some remarkable footprints\r\nhad been discovered on slabs of stone not many months before Lyell's\r\nvisit, but as the beds on which they occurred belonged to the coal\r\nmeasures doubt had been expressed as to their being genuine, so he went\r\nthither to satisfy himself on this point. The footprints had disturbed\r\nthe peace of Pittsburg, for they had started discussions in which one\r\nparty had assumed, as matters of course, the high antiquity of the\r\nearth and the great changes in its living tenants, and had thus incurred\r\nthe censure--which in some cases was followed by professional\r\ninjury--not only of the multitude, but also of some of the Roman\r\nCatholic and Lutheran clergy. Commenting on this episode, Lyell quotes\r\nwith approbation the words of a contemporary author,[115] which even at\r\nthe present time occasionally need to be remembered:--\"To nothing but\r\nerror can any truth be dangerous; and I know not where else there is to\r\nbe seen so altogether tragical a spectacle, as that religion should be\r\nfound standing in the highways to say 'Let no man learn the simplest\r\nlaws of the universe, lest they mislearn the highest. In the name of God\r\nthe Maker, who said, and hourly yet says, \"Let there be light,\" we\r\ncommand that you continue in darkness!'\"\r\n\r\nThe travellers crossed the Alleghany Mountains in their way to\r\nPhiladelphia. But a piece of work in Virginia had been left unfinished\r\non the last occasion--the examination of the Jurassic coalfield near\r\nRichmond. So he set off thither, leaving Mrs. Lyell in Philadelphia, and\r\ntook the opportunity of examining the Tertiary deposits near the former\r\ntown and the Eocene strata on the Potomac River. On his return they went\r\nto Burlington, which they reached in the first week in May, just as the\r\nhumming-birds were arriving in hundreds, and by the 7th of the month\r\nthey were in New York. The age of the so-called Taconic Group--a\r\nquestion of which so much has been heard of late years--was then\r\nbeginning to attract attention, so Lyell went in company with some\r\nAmerican geologists to Albany in the hope of solving the problem. This\r\nhe trusted he had done, but as his conclusions now would be deemed\r\nunsatisfactory, they need not be quoted. In reality, the question at\r\nthat time was not even ripe for discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the homeward journey he turned aside at Boston to visit Wenham Lake,\r\nfrom which much ice was being supplied to London, and then they left for\r\nEngland by a steam packet which touched at Halifax. Four days after\r\nleaving this place they passed among a \"group of icebergs several\r\nhundreds in number, varying in height from 100 to 200 feet,\" many of\r\nthem picturesque in form, some even fantastic. Stones were resting on\r\none of them, but as a rule they were perfectly clean and dazzlingly\r\nwhite, except on the wave-worn parts, which, as usual, were a beautiful\r\nblue. These, and a fine aurora borealis on the next night, were the only\r\nincidents of the voyage, and on June 13th, in twelve and a half days\r\nfrom Boston, the vessel reached Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe close of this journey marks an epoch in Lyell's life. It was the\r\nlast--unless we except his visit to Madeira--of his long wanderings for\r\nthe purpose of questioning Nature face to face, and of studying her\r\nunder various aspects and diverse conditions. He did not, indeed, cease\r\nto travel. He twice returned to America, he revisited Sicily and various\r\nparts of Europe, but these journeys not only occupied less time but also\r\nled him among scenes for the most part not unfamiliar. He doubtless felt\r\nthat on reaching his fiftieth year he might fairly regard the more\r\nlaborious part of his education completed, although he never ceased to\r\nbe a learner, even to the latest days of his life, when strength had\r\nfailed and memory was becoming weak.\r\n\r\nAn account of the above-named journey was published in 1849, under the\r\ntitle of \"A Second Visit to the United States of North America.\" This\r\nbook, in addition to descriptions of the scenery and the geology of the\r\ncountry, contains much general information about the people, with\r\nremarks by the author on various political questions, such as the\r\ncondition of parties, the effects of almost universal suffrage,\r\nparticularly on the national sense of honour and morality, the existence\r\nand evils of slavery, the state of religious feeling, the position of\r\nChurches, and the systems of education, especially when contrasted with\r\nthose of England. Some of these questions about this time were exciting\r\nmuch attention in Great Britain, and in regard to one matter--the\r\ndelimitation of the territories of the two nations in the region west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains--friction existed, which was so serious that more\r\nthan once war seemed possible. On this account, probably, the \"Second\r\nVisit\" was a greater success, commercially speaking, than the \"Travels,\"\r\nfor it reached a third edition.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] Chapters xiv. and xxix.\r\n\r\n[106] \"The Girvan Succession,\" Quart.

Carlyle (\"Letter on Secular Education\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSTEADY PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Principles of Geology\" had been completed and published for\r\nthirteen years, yet catastrophism, as we learn from a correspondence\r\nwith Edward Forbes,[116] dated September, 1846, was dying hard.\r\n\"Agassiz, Alcide D'Orbigny, and their followers [were still] trying to\r\nmake out sudden revolutions in organic life in support of equally\r\nhypothetical catastrophes in the physical history of the globe.\"[117] A\r\nremark in Forbes's reply is striking:--\r\n\r\n      \"You are pleased to compliment my paper on its\r\n      _originality_. Any praise from you must ever be among the\r\n      greatest gratifications to me, and to any honest labourer in\r\n      the great field of Nature. But I had rather hear the views I\r\n      have set forward be proved _not original_ than the contrary.\r\n      It seems to me that the surest proof of the _truth_ of such\r\n      conclusions as I have summed up at the end of my essay is\r\n      the fact of their not being _original_ so far as _one_\r\n      person is concerned, and of their having become manifest to\r\n      _more than one_ mind, either about the same time or\r\n      successively, without communication. I believe laws discover\r\n      themselves to individuals, and not that individuals discover\r\n      laws. If a law have truth in it, many will see it about the\r\n      same time.\"\r\n\r\nIn this month also the Lyells removed from Hart Street to 11, Harley\r\nStreet. The house where they had spent fourteen years very happily was\r\nnot left without regret, but it had become too small. They had no\r\nchildren, but a rapidly increasing geological collection takes up almost\r\nas much room as (though it is much more silent than) a growing family.\r\nThe removal of a geological collection is a laborious business; and,\r\nbesides this, Lyell was preparing a new edition of the \"Principles\" and\r\nwriting a book about his recent travels in America. Still, to judge from\r\nhis letters, he found time for some pleasant social distractions; for\r\nhis letters to the old home at Kinnordy contain more often than formerly\r\ninteresting references to talks with such men as Macaulay, Milman, and\r\nRogers, Lord Clarendon and Lord Lansdowne. The seventh edition of the\r\n\"Principles,\" condensed into a bulky single volume, was published early\r\nin 1847, and in the following June Lyell attended the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association at Oxford, which appears to have been no less\r\npleasant than successful, although \"out of twenty-four Heads of Houses\r\nonly four were at Oxford to receive the Association.\" On this occasion,\r\nhe writes, he became better acquainted with \"Ruskin, who was secretary\r\nof our Geological Section.\" The remainder of this summer was spent in\r\nScotland, and the rest of the year, with most of the following one, was\r\ndevoted to quiet work. Still, Lyell took an active part in a crisis\r\nthrough which, about this time, the Royal Society was passing. A number\r\nof the Fellows, including most of those eminent in science, were anxious\r\nto raise the standard for admission into the Society. For many years\r\npast the \"three letters\" had often signified little more than an\r\nindication of good means and social position, coupled with a certain\r\ninterest in scientific pursuits. The reformers prevailed, after a long\r\nstruggle \"with a set of obstructives compared with whom Metternich was\r\na progressive animal,\" and the present _status_ of the society is the\r\nresult. Incidental remarks in Lyell's letters to his relations also\r\nindicate that he was becoming well known in circles other than\r\nscientific, of which a further proof was given in the autumn of 1848,\r\nwhen he received the offer of knighthood. Of course, in any country\r\nwhere \"orders of merit\" exist, other than Great Britain, Lyell would\r\nhave been \"decorated\" years ago, but we manage things differently. As a\r\nrule, we let science and literature be their own reward, and, as an\r\nexception, confer the same distinction on a man who has won a world-wide\r\nreputation (provided he is fairly rich) and on an opulent tradesman who\r\nis accidently prominent on some auspicious occasion, or is a local\r\nwirepuller in party politics. Lyell went over from Kinnordy to Balmoral\r\nto receive the intended honour, and had, as he writes, \"a most agreeable\r\ngeological exploring on the banks of the Dee, into which Prince Albert\r\nentered with much spirit.\" In February, 1849, he was elected for the\r\nsecond time President of the Geological Society, and in the autumn, when\r\nat Kinnordy, was again invited to Balmoral, where he had some\r\ninteresting talks with Prince Albert on subjects ranging from various\r\neducational and broad political questions to the entomology of\r\nSwitzerland, Scotland, and the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of September he attended the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Birmingham, where he was for the third time President of\r\nthe Geological Section. A few weeks later his father, whose health had\r\nbeen for some time failing, died at Kinnordy.[118] The latter was a\r\nrich man, but as he made liberal provision for his daughters and younger\r\nsons, Sir Charles, though he succeeded to a considerable estate, found\r\nhimself unable to afford the expense of keeping up Kinnordy as well as a\r\nhouse in London. Which, then, was henceforth to be his home? The\r\nattractions of Kinnordy were obvious, but the long distance from the\r\nmetropolis was a serious drawback, while the duties of a resident\r\nlandlord would have interfered much with his geological work, which\r\nwould have been still more hampered by the severance from libraries,\r\nmuseums, and intercourse with fellow-workers. Thus he felt it his duty\r\nto retain his house in London and to let Kinnordy, though, as his mother\r\nand sisters retreated to the \"dower house,\" he was able from time to\r\ntime to visit the old place. The decision probably was less painful than\r\nit otherwise would have been from the fact that his boyhood had been\r\nspent in England. At any rate, it was a wise one, in regard to both his\r\nown reputation and the progress of science in general.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1850, Sir Charles augmented his experience and\r\nrefreshed old memories by a tour in Germany. During this he saw for the\r\nfirst time the Roth-todt-liegende or Lower Permian conglomerates at\r\nHalle and at Eisenach, as well as the great lava streams which had\r\nsupplied them with so much of their materials. Also he went to the\r\nBrocken in order to examine into Von Buch's extraordinary assertion that\r\nthe granite had \"come up in a bubble.\" This, it is needless to say, was\r\nspeedily pricked. The loess also, that singular deposit which wraps\r\nlike a mantle so much of the undulating ground in Northern Germany,\r\nevidently engaged his attention, and we find the fruits of these studies\r\nin a later work. In addition to all this, he did more than glance at the\r\nMaestricht Chalk, the \"Wealden\" coal of Hanover, the Tertiary deposits\r\nnear Berlin, the Palaeozoic rocks of the Hartz, and the scenery of the\r\nSaxon Switzerland.\r\n\r\nHis books, his scientific papers, and Presidential addresses to the\r\nGeological Society, his duties as a commissioner, at first for the\r\nExhibition of 1851, and somewhat later for the reform of the University\r\nof Oxford, kept him pretty well employed till August, 1852, when he for\r\nthe third time crossed the Atlantic to deliver another course of\r\nlectures at the Lowell Institute, Boston. Though he was back in England\r\nbefore Christmas, he found time for some geological work in America, the\r\nmost important item in which was an excursion from Halifax in company\r\nwith his old acquaintance, Mr. J. W. Dawson, to the Nova Scotian\r\ncoalfield. On this occasion he passed through a fair amount of country\r\nstill uncleared, which made the journey more interesting; he had also\r\nopportunities of appreciating the effects of ice in moving and piling up\r\nboulders on the shores of lakes, and obtained still more evidence in\r\nregard to this, on reaching the sea-coast in the neighbourhood of the\r\ncoalfield. But their labour was rewarded by one discovery of exceptional\r\nimportance. In the trunk of a tree which had died and become hollow in a\r\nforest of the Carboniferous period, they found entombed the skeleton of\r\nan animal. Whether this were a fish or a reptile was at first hotly\r\ndisputed, but finally it proved to be an amphibian.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, Sir Charles was kept for some time fully\r\nemployed by the preparation of the ninth edition of the \"Principles,\"\r\nbut early in the summer of 1853 he went for the fourth time to\r\nAmerica--on this occasion in company with Lord Ellesmere--as\r\ncommissioner to the Exhibition held at New York. But now his time was\r\nfully taken up by official duties, and his visit was a short one, for he\r\nreturned before the end of July, and was soon afterwards invited to\r\nvisit Osborne and give some account of his journey to the Queen and\r\nPrince Albert.\r\n\r\nVery early in 1854 he again left England, in company with Lady Lyell and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bunbury, to visit Madeira. Some three weeks were devoted to\r\na careful study of the geology of that island,[119] partly with the view\r\nof determining whether it afforded any support to Von Buch's favourite\r\nnotion that volcanic cones were mainly formed by upheaval. As might be\r\nanticipated, the evidence was distinctly unfavourable. The island was\r\nproved to be mainly composed of volcanic material, cones of basaltic\r\nscoria, and great flows of similar lava, which had been piled\r\nsuccessively one on another in the open air to a depth of about 4,000\r\nfeet. This mass had been subsequently pierced by dykes, worn by storm\r\nand stream, and in one or two places deeply grooved by rivers. There\r\nwere, indeed, some underlying beds of marine origin, which, in one part\r\nof the island, rose to a height of 1,200 feet above the sea, and thus\r\nindicated a certain amount of upheaval; but even this was not of the\r\nkind which Von Buch's hypothesis required, while the rest of the\r\nevidence, including that afforded by some tuffs containing fossil\r\nplants, proved that the major part of the island had been formed above\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFrom Madeira they went on to Teneriffe, Palma, and the Grand Canary. Of\r\nthis part of the journey few details are given, but the results were\r\nafterwards incorporated with one of his books.[120] To the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe the reference is comparatively brief. Of Palma the account is\r\nmuch fuller, for this island had been regarded by Von Buch, who visited\r\nit in 1825, as a type of his \"craters of elevation\"--an idea which was\r\ndispelled by Lyell's investigation. The Grand Canary, like Madeira,\r\nproved to be formed of masses of subaerial volcanic rock, perhaps even\r\nthicker than those in Madeira, which also rested upon some upraised\r\nmarine deposits of Miocene age.\r\n\r\nIn the course of 1854 Sir Charles received from his own University the\r\nhonorary degree of D.C.L. Much time was spent in working up the results\r\nof his last journey, some of which were communicated to the Geological\r\nSociety.[121] In the spring of 1855 he went to the Continent, studying,\r\namong other matters, the drifts in the neighbourhood of Berlin. In the\r\nsummer he visited Scotland, made the acquaintance of Hugh Miller, worked\r\nover Arthur's Seat, Blackford Hill, and \"the coast of Fife from Kinghorn\r\nto Kirkcaldy.\" It would be hard to find a set of sections better\r\nadapted for the study of ancient volcanic rocks, both contemporaneous\r\nand intrusive, than this coast affords; and his experience in Madeira\r\nand the Canaries enabled him to regard \"the Edinburgh and Fife rocks\r\nwith very different eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOne or two of his published letters about this period have a special\r\ninterest, for they show that his views on the origin of species were\r\nundergoing a gradual modification. Speaking of some strange variations\r\nin the flower of an orchideous plant,[122] he refers, half in jest, to\r\n\"ugly facts, as Hooker, clinging (like me) to the orthodox faith, calls\r\nthese and other abnormal vagaries\"; and again, the following sentences\r\ndo not come from a man who is firm in his belief[123]:--\r\n\r\n      \"When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin's last\r\n      week, they (all four of them) ran a tilt against species\r\n      further, I believe, than they are deliberately prepared to\r\n      go--Wollaston least unorthodox. I cannot easily see how they\r\n      can go so far, and not embrace the whole Lamarckian\r\n      doctrine. Huxley held forth last week about the oxlip, which\r\n      he says is unknown on the Continent. If we had met with it\r\n      in Madeira and nowhere else, or the cowslip, should we not\r\n      have voted them true species? Darwin finds, among his\r\n      fifteen varieties of the common pigeon, three good genera\r\n      and about fifteen good species, according to the received\r\n      mode of species and genus-making of the best ornithologists,\r\n      and the bony skeleton varying with the rest! After all, did\r\n      we not come from an ourang, seeing that man is of the Old\r\n      World, and not from the American type of anthropomorphous\r\n      mammalia?\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles and Lady Lyell were again on the Continent in the summer of\r\n1856, examining the drifts of Northern Germany, visiting Humboldt at\r\nBerlin, discussing geological questions, especially in regard to\r\nCarboniferous plants, at Breslau with Roemer and Goeppert; working over\r\nthe Riesengebirge; then going on to Dresden, and passing through the\r\nSaxon Switzerland to Aussig. The coalfield north-west of the former city\r\nwas not neglected, the great breccia beds of the Rothliegende were again\r\nexamined, and account was taken of Ramsay's opinion that certain British\r\nPermian breccias were glacial in origin. Close attention was also\r\nbestowed upon the great masses of hard quartzose grit, through which the\r\nElbe has carved its way--the Quader of Saxony; for this formation, \"a\r\ngrit wholly deficient in calcareous matter, corresponds to the more\r\npurely calcareous rock (Chalk) of Great Britain, and yet contains here\r\nand there the same shells.\" He did not neglect the Brown Coal[124]\r\nbetween Toeplitz and Aussig, and, on reaching Prague, made the\r\nacquaintance of Barrande, who took him to see those older Palaeozoic\r\nrocks among which the great palaeontologist had been labouring for nearly\r\na quarter of a century. Then the travellers proceeded to Vienna, and\r\nafter that to the Styrian Alps, to visit various interesting sections in\r\nthe Salzkammergut, such as the classic ground at Gosau and the Triassic\r\nlimestones near Hallstadt, where the last survivors of the Palaeozoic\r\nages are entombed with the representatives of the period. His letters,\r\nlike many others of earlier date, indicate that, notwithstanding the\r\nfascinations of geology, neither living molluscs, nor insects, nor\r\nplants had ceased to interest. They returned by way of Munich, Ulm,\r\nZuerich and Paris, reaching England about the end of October.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1857 was devoted to another Continental tour, rather more\r\nrestricted than the former, but by no means unimportant. They went\r\nleisurely through Belgium and up the Rhine into Switzerland, halting at\r\ndifferent places either to study sections of special interest or to\r\nconfer with eminent geologists. Part of a letter written at this\r\ntime[125] gives a valuable insight into the intention of these journeys\r\nand the character of the author, who was now in his sixtieth year:--\r\n\r\n      \"I hope to continue for years travelling, making original\r\n      observations, and, above all, going to school to the\r\n      younger, but not, for all that, young geologists, whom I\r\n      meet everywhere, so far ahead of us old stagers that they\r\n      are familiar with branches of the science, fast rising into\r\n      importance, which were not thought of when I first began.\"\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, obviously, was visited on this occasion with a very\r\ndefinite purpose. De Charpentier, Escher von der Linth, and other local\r\ngeologists, had been for some time asserting that the glaciers of the\r\nAlps, at no remote epoch in geological history, had attained to an\r\nenormous size, had buried the Swiss lowland and covered it with morainic\r\ndeposits, and had even welled up high against the flanks of the Jura,\r\nwhere the huge blocks of protogine from the Mont Blanc range--such as\r\nPierre a bot and its companion erratics, full 800 feet above the Lake of\r\nNeuchatel--indicated one position of its terminal moraine. Formerly, in\r\ncommon with many other geologists, Sir Charles had supposed these blocks\r\nto have been transported from the Alpine peaks by ice-rafts on the sea,\r\nat a time when the whole region stood at a considerably lower level. But\r\nnow, after examining the erratics, their regular and significant\r\ndistribution, the other glacial debris, the ice-worn surfaces of rock\r\nbeneath it, and ascertaining the distinctly terrestrial character of the\r\ndeposits all about the mountains, he unreservedly admitted land-ice to\r\nbe the only possible agent, and, in accepting this hypothesis, perceived\r\nclearly that he must not shrink from applying it to Scotland. Then he\r\nplunged into the mountains to examine and follow the track of the\r\nretreating ice-sheet up to the glaciers which are still at work among\r\nthe higher peaks, passing up the valley of the Reuss, crossing the Furka\r\nPass, and descending the Rhone valley to Visp, but turning aside to\r\nexamine the earth pillars on the flank of the Eggishorn.[126] Another,\r\nand a larger group of these pillars--instances of the erosive action of\r\nrain-water on morainic material--was seen near Stalden, in the\r\nVisp-thal; but these had been damaged by the earthquake which two years\r\nbefore had severely shaken this part of the Alps. At Zermatt the\r\ncharacteristics of glaciers and the effects of ice were carefully\r\nstudied among the grandest of Alpine scenery; then, on returning to the\r\nRhone Valley, they crossed the Alps by the Simplon and went on to Turin.\r\nHere he took the opportunity of visiting the huge moraine near Ivrea,\r\nwhich rises from the lowland like a range of hills, and of\r\ninvestigating the erratics of the Superga, satisfying himself that they\r\nreally belonged to the Miocene deposits of that hill, and were\r\nindicative of the existence of glaciers in the Alps of that epoch, which\r\nhad been large enough to reach the sea-level, and to send off masses of\r\nice laden with boulders. Then they went on to Genoa, and along the\r\nbeautiful Riviera di Levante to Pisa; thence, after a short visit to\r\nFlorence, proceeding direct from Leghorn to Naples. Here, he once more\r\nexamined Vesuvius, and had the luck to see lava streams actually in\r\nmotion--\"some going fast, others going very slow\"--a sight which \"gave\r\nhim many new ideas.\" A study also of the dykes of Somma convinced him\r\nthat they afforded no support to De Beaumont's idea of a distension of\r\nthe mass.[127]\r\n\r\nFrom Naples he went to Sicily, in order to make a second examination of\r\nEtna, and then, after rejoining Lady Lyell, spent some time in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rome, visiting the old volcanic district of the Alban\r\nHills, and making excursions, as they travelled northward, into the\r\nApennines. They returned through France, reaching London towards the end\r\nof December.\r\n\r\nBut, for a worker so thorough in his methods, this visit to the\r\nvolcanoes was not enough, so next year, after spending the earlier part\r\nof the summer with his brother's[128] family in the neighbourhood of\r\nDarmstadt, he left Lady Lyell there, and set off towards the end of\r\nAugust for a third examination both of Vesuvius and of Etna. Travelling\r\nrapidly up the valley of the Rhine, he went by Geneva to Culoz, and over\r\nMont Cenis to Turin and Genoa, without halting for geological work, and\r\nthence by sea to Naples. Lava was still flowing from Vesuvius, that\r\nblack mass, with its strange rope-like folds and slaggy wrinkles,[129]\r\nnow so well known to every visitor. Accompanied by Professor\r\nGuiscardi--one of the most genial and helpful of leaders--Sir Charles\r\nmade his way to a vent at the base of the principal cone, where the lava\r\nwas still welling forth from \"a small grotto, looking as fluid as water\r\nwhere it first issued, and moving at a pace which you would call rapid\r\nin a river. White-hot, at first, in a canal four or five feet broad,\r\nthen red before it had got on a yard, then in a few feet beginning to be\r\ncovered by a dark scum, which thickened fast and was carried along on\r\nthe surface.\" But the great question, whether a volcano was mainly a\r\n\"crater of elevation\" or a \"crater of ejection,\" was ever present to his\r\nmind; so, in addition to studying the grand sections displayed in the\r\ncrags of Monte Somma, he devoted two days to the exploration of the\r\nravines which furrow its outer slopes. He also found time to have\r\nanother look at the Temple of Serapis, and to examine the Solfatara,\r\nwhich is a striking example of a crater at once broad and low.\r\n\r\nAfter a week's halt at Naples, Sir Charles resumed his journey to\r\nSicily, landing at Messina on September 10th. By the 15th he was once\r\nmore on the slopes of Etna, and had begun a twelve-day period of hard\r\nwork on the mountain, passing five nights in very rough quarters at the\r\nCasa degli Inglesi, 9,600 feet above sea-level. During this stay he\r\nascended the principal cone, carefully examining both the larger and the\r\nsmaller craters, and descended into the Val del Bove, a laborious\r\nexpedition, but one which well repaid him by throwing much light on the\r\nstructure of the volcanic mass. Still he was not yet satisfied, for\r\nafter he had descended to Zafarana, he returned to spend another night\r\nat the Casa degli Inglesi in order to satisfy himself about one or two\r\ndetails. From Zafarana also he went again to the Val del Bove, checking\r\nand increasing his notes, and devoted another day to a most interesting\r\nexcursion through picturesque scenery as far as the watershed between\r\nthis vast hollow in the mountain side and the neighbouring Val di\r\nTripodo. On all these excursions Sir Charles, as far as possible, rode,\r\nremarking to his wife, \"I feel here that a good mule is like presenting\r\nan old geologist with a young pair of legs.\" Work on the mountain ended,\r\nhe spent a little time in examining the Tertiary beds of the\r\nneighbouring lowland, and then, getting back to Messina about the middle\r\nof October, returned in due course to England.\r\n\r\nThese two journeys in succession greatly augmented his knowledge of the\r\nstructure of volcanic cones, and enabled him to deal the death-blow to\r\nthe \"crater of elevation\" hypothesis which had found such favour among\r\nContinental geologists. He could now prove that lava would solidify in a\r\ncompact form on slopes of thirty-five or even forty degrees--a fact\r\nwhich had been stoutly denied by advocates of that hypothesis, and was\r\nable to offer an explanation of the singular structure of the Val del\r\nBove, viz. that it was a huge gulf, formed by a series of mighty\r\nexplosions, similar to those which shattered half of the old crater of\r\nVesuvius,[130] and sent one side of Bandai San[131] flying through the\r\nair. He returned to England satisfied that his feet were on firm ground,\r\nif such a phrase be permissible in regard to a volcano, and that the\r\nresults[132] of this conscientious labour in the fulness of his age had\r\nstrengthened him in the position which he had adopted in his scientific\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nIn the next year (1859) Lyell also travelled, though the journeys were\r\nnot so lengthy as their two predecessors. Still, in the spring he\r\nvisited both Holland and Le Puy in Auvergne, and in the earlier part of\r\nthe autumn attended the meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen,\r\nunder the presidency of Prince Albert. A strong body of geologists were\r\npresent, and Lyell was for the fourth time in the chair of the\r\nGeological Section, the Prince coming to hear his address. Among the old\r\nfriends whom he met was one who would have been a suitable husband for\r\nthe famous Countess of Desmond, for Lyell writes of him to Mrs. Horner,\r\nhis wife's mother, \"Dr. F. at ninety-four looks well enough, but having\r\neaten turtle-soup, and melon too close to the rind, and other\r\nimprudences, is not quite well to-day!\" _O dura Doctorum ilia!_ The\r\nmeeting ended, Lyell with some geological friends went off to Elgin to\r\nexamine the sandstone quarried at Cutties Hillock, near that town. The\r\nrock closely resembles the ordinary Old Red Sandstone; it seemed at\r\nfirst sight to form a continuous mass, yet in one place it contained a\r\nfossil fish belonging to that period, and in another the remains of a\r\nreptile (_Telerpeton_). After some days of careful study, the Rev. W. S.\r\nSymonds, who was one of the party, came to the conclusion (which has\r\nbeen fully ratified by later investigations) that the deposits were of\r\ndifferent ages; the one with the fish being truly \"Old Red,\" the other,\r\nwith the reptile, \"New Red.\" The chief cause of the puzzle is that the\r\nsand which has been derived from the older rock has gone to form the\r\nnewer one, and that the usual indications of a discontinuity are\r\npractically absent. It affords a valuable caution, for it shows that\r\nNature sometimes does set traps, which might well catch even the most\r\nwary geologist.\r\n\r\nIn the same autumn Lyell read Darwin's great work on \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" by which his scientific position was finally determined, for\r\nhis letters show that, if any objection to the leading principles in his\r\nfriend's views had still lingered in his mind, they were overcome by the\r\nperusal of this masterly specimen \"of close reasoning and long sustained\r\nargument.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] In reference to an essay written by him on the connection between\r\nthe fauna and flora of the British Isles and geological changes.\r\n(\"Memoirs of the Geological Survey,\" i. p. 336.)\r\n\r\n[117] Life, Letters, and Journals, vol ii. p. 110.\r\n\r\n[118] He died November 8th, 1849.\r\n\r\n[119] He had the advantage of the company of Mr. C.

He received\r\nthe Copley Medal from the Royal Society in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUITY OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough many men on reaching their sixty-third year are content to rest\r\nupon their oars and not to attempt new ventures, Lyell had plunged into\r\na question which was arousing almost as much excitement as the origin of\r\nspecies--namely, the antiquity of man. It was a question, indeed, which\r\nfor a long time must have been before his mind--witness his remarks on\r\nDr. Schmerling's work in the caves near Liege; but it had assumed a\r\nspecial significance owing to the famous discovery of flint implements\r\nin the valley of the Somme.[133] The whole subject also would have a\r\nspecial interest for Lyell, because he had made Tertiary deposits his\r\nspecial field in stratigraphy, and had worked at this subject downwards,\r\ncomparing extinct with living forms, so that he had seen more than\r\nothers of the borderland which blends by an insensible transition the\r\nprovince of the geologist with that of the archaeologist. Probably also\r\nthe thought which he had been giving to the question of the origin of\r\nspecies would bring into no less vivid prominence that of the age and\r\norigin of the human race. Be this as it may, he undertook a task\r\ncomparatively novel, and for the next three years was fully occupied in\r\nthe preparation of his third great book, \"The Antiquity of Man.\" Travel\r\nwas necessary for this purpose also; but as the journeys were less\r\nlengthy than those already described, and led him for the most part over\r\nold ground, it is needless to enter into details. He visited the gravels\r\nof the Somme Valley and the caves on the Meuse, besides other parts of\r\nNorthern France and Belgium,[134] the gravel pits near Bedford, and\r\nvarious localities in England, examining into the evidence for himself,\r\nand paying particular attention, not only to the question of man's\r\nantiquity, but also to the supposed return of a warmer climate than now\r\nprevails after the era of glacial cold. The book was published early in\r\n1863. Naturally its conclusions were startling to many and were\r\nvigourously denounced by some; but it was a great success, for it ran\r\nthrough three editions in the course of the year. A fourth and enlarged\r\nedition was published in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe book may seem, from the literary critic's point of view, rather\r\ncomposite in character, and this objection was made in a good-natured\r\nform by a writer in the _Saturday Review_,[135] who called it \"a trilogy\r\non the antiquity of man, ice, and Darwin.\" That, however, is but a\r\nslight blemish, if blemish it be, and it was readily pardoned, because\r\nof the general interest of the book, the clearness of its style, and the\r\nlucidity of its reasoning.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his usual plan of work--proceeding tentatively from\r\nthe known to the unknown--Lyell begins with times nearest to the\r\npresent era and facts of which the interpretation is least open to\r\ndispute. He conducts his reader at the outset to the peat mosses of\r\nDenmark, where weapons of iron, bronze, and stone lie in a kind of\r\nstratified order; and to those mounds of shells, the refuse heaps of a\r\nrude people, which are found on the Baltic shore. Next he places him on\r\nthe site of the pile-built villages which once fringed the shores of\r\nSwiss and Italian lakes. Here weapons of iron, of bronze, and of stone\r\nare hidden in peat or scattered on the lake-bed. But these log-built\r\nsettlements, such as those which Herodotus described at Lake Prasias in\r\nRoumelia, are not the only remnants of an almost prehistoric people, for\r\nnearer home we find analogous constructions in the crannoges of\r\nIreland--islets partly artificial, built of timber and stone. Lyell then\r\npasses on from Europe to the valleys of the Nile and Mississippi, and so\r\nto the \"carses\" of Scotland. In the last case canoes buried in the\r\nalluvial deposits, as in the lowland by the Clyde, indicate that some\r\nphysical changes, slight though they may be, have occurred since the\r\ncoming of man. But none of these researches lead us back into a very\r\nremote past; they keep us still lingering, as it were, on the threshold\r\nof history. The weapons which have been described, even if made of\r\nstone, exhibit a considerable amount of mechanical skill, for many of\r\nthem are fashioned and polished with much care, while they are\r\nassociated with the remains of creatures which are still living at no\r\ngreat distance, if not in the immediate vicinity. Accordingly he\r\nconducts his reader, in the next place, to the localities where ruder\r\nweapons only have been found, fashioned by chipping, and never\r\npolished--namely, to the caves of Belgium and of Britain, of Central and\r\nof Southern France, and to the gravel beds in the valleys of the Somme\r\nand the Seine, of the Ouse and other rivers of Eastern and Southern\r\nEngland. These furnish abundant evidence that man was contemporary with\r\nseveral extinct animals, such as the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros,\r\nor with others which now inhabit only arctic regions, such as the\r\nreindeer and the musksheep, and that the valleys since then have been\r\ndeepened and altered in contour. This evidence, stratigraphical as well\r\nas palaeontological, proves that important changes have occurred since\r\nman first appeared, not only in climate, but also in physical geography.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial Epoch is the subject of the second part of the book. Its\r\npages contain an admirable sketch of the deposits assigned to that age\r\nin Eastern England, Scandinavia, the Alps, and North America, with\r\nspecial descriptions of the loess of Northern Europe, the drifts of the\r\nDanish island of Moeen, so like those near Cromer, and the parallel roads\r\nof Glenroy, which Lyell now supposes to have been formed in a manner\r\nsimilar to that of the little terrace by the Maerjalen See.\r\n\r\nThe third part deals with \"the origin of species as bearing on man's\r\nplace in Nature.\" It is a recantation of the views which he had formerly\r\nmaintained. In all his earlier writings, including the ninth edition of\r\nthe \"Principles,\" he had expressed himself dissatisfied with the\r\nhypothesis of the transmutation of species, and had accepted, though\r\ncautiously and not without allowing for considerable power of variation,\r\nthat of specific centres of creation. Now, after a full review of the\r\nquestion, he gives his reasons for abandoning his earlier opinions and\r\nadopting in the main those advocated by Darwin and Wallace.\r\nNevertheless, through frankly avowing his change of view, he advances\r\ncautiously and tentatively, like a man over treacherous ice--so\r\ncautiously, indeed, that Darwin is not wholly satisfied with his\r\nconvert, and chides him good-humouredly for his slow progress and\r\nover-much hesitation. But this very hesitation was as real as the\r\nconversion: the one was the outcome of Lyell's thoroughly judicial habit\r\nof mind, the other was a proof, perhaps the strongest that could be\r\ngiven, of that mind's freshness, vigour, and candour. The book ends with\r\na chapter on \"man's place in Nature.\" On this burning question the\r\nauthor speaks with great caution, but comes to the conclusion that man,\r\nso far as his bodily frame is concerned, cannot claim exception from the\r\nlaw which governs the rest of the animal kingdom and he ends[136] with a\r\nfew words on the theological aspect of the question: \"It may be said\r\nthat, so far from having a materialistic tendency, the supposed\r\nintroduction into the earth, at successive geological periods, of\r\nlife--sensation--instinct--the intelligence of the higher mammalia\r\nbordering on reason--and, lastly, the improvable reason of man himself,\r\npresents us with a picture of the ever-increasing dominion of mind over\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] Found by M. Boucher de Perthes, who had published a book on the\r\nsubject in 1847, and had announced the discovery about seven years\r\nearlier; but geologists, for various reasons, were not fully satisfied\r\non the matter till the visit of Messrs. Prestwich and John Evans (now\r\nSir) in 1857.\r\n\r\n[134] He went to Florence in 1862, but how far this was for geological\r\nwork is not stated.\r\n\r\n[135] Vol. xv. p. 311.\r\n\r\n[136] \"Antiquity of Man,\" chap. xxiv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second and third editions of the \"Antiquity of Man\" were not mere\r\nreprints, since new materials were constantly coming in and researches\r\nwere continued; for during the summer of 1863 Sir Charles was rambling\r\nabout Wales, visiting the caves of Gower in Pembrokeshire, and of Cefn\r\nin Denbighshire, the peats of Anglesea, and the boulder clay and\r\nshell-bearing sands near the top of Moel Tryfaen. He also went over to\r\nParis, apparently about this time, to inquire into the authenticity of\r\nspecimens--bones with notches upon them--which were supposed to prove\r\nman contemporaneous with the Cromer Forest Beds of England, and\r\ntherefore pre-glacial. Shorter journeys were to Osborne (by Royal\r\ncommand), to Suffolk, and to Kent.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged on the above-named book, he had persistently refused more\r\nthan one position of honour--such as a Trusteeship at the British\r\nMuseum, to be a candidate for the representation of the University of\r\nLondon in Parliament, even an honorary degree from the University of\r\nEdinburgh because he was too busy to undertake the journey. In 1861,\r\nalso, he seems to have received a warning that he was beginning to grow\r\nold, for he became rather seriously unwell, and was ordered to Kissingen\r\nin Bavaria to take a course of the waters. But during the same period\r\ntwo acceptable honours were received--namely, the Corresponding\r\nMembership of the Institute of France, in 1862, and an order of\r\nScientific Merit from the King of Prussia in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe years, as must be the case when life's evening shadows are\r\nlengthening, begin to be more definitely chequered with losses and with\r\nrewards. In his letters, references to the death of friends become\r\nfrequent. In 1862 Mrs. Horner, Lady Lyell's mother, died, and in 1864\r\nher father, Leonard Horner, with whom, even for some years before\r\nbecoming his son-in-law, Lyell had been in constant friendly\r\ncorrespondence, passed away in his eightieth year. In the same year\r\nLyell was raised to the rank of baronet, and also occupied the\r\npresidential chair at the meeting of the British Association at Bath.\r\n\r\nHis address deals principally with two topics--one local, thermal\r\nsprings, especially those of Bath; the other general, the glacial epoch\r\nand its relation to the antiquity of man. He refers, however, in the\r\nconcluding paragraph to the marked change which, within his memory,\r\nopinion had undergone, in regard to catastrophic changes and the origin\r\nof species, and to the discovery of the supposed fossil _Eozoon\r\nCanadense_ in the crystalline Laurentian rocks of Canada. This singular\r\nstructure appeared to him--as it did to Sir W. Logan, who had brought\r\nspecimens for exhibition at the meeting--to be a fossil organism,[137]\r\nand thus to indicate the existence of living creatures at a much\r\nearlier period than hitherto had been supposed. But in stating this\r\nopinion he checks himself characteristically with these words: \"I will\r\nnot venture on speculations respecting 'the signs of a beginning,' or\r\n'the prospects of an end' of our terrestrial system--that wide ocean of\r\nscientific conjecture on which so many theorists before my time have\r\nsuffered shipwreck.\"\r\n\r\nThe address contains more than one passage that is well worth quotation,\r\nbut the following has so wide a bearing, and is so significant as to the\r\neffects of early influences, that it should not be forgotten:--\r\n\r\n      \"When speculations on the long series of events which\r\n      occurred in the Glacial and post-Glacial periods are\r\n      indulged in, the imagination is apt to take alarm at the\r\n      immensity of the time required to interpret the monuments of\r\n      these ages, all referable to the era of existing species. In\r\n      order to abridge the number of centuries which would\r\n      otherwise be indispensable, a disposition is shown by many\r\n      to magnify the rate of change in prehistoric times, by\r\n      investing the causes which have modified the animate and\r\n      inanimate world with extraordinary and excessive energy. It\r\n      is related of a great Irish orator of our day, that when he\r\n      was about to contribute somewhat parsimoniously towards a\r\n      public charity, he was persuaded by a friend to make a more\r\n      liberal donation. In doing so, he apologised for his first\r\n      apparent want of generosity by saying that his early life\r\n      had been a constant struggle with scanty means, and that\r\n      'they who are born to affluence cannot easily imagine how\r\n      long a time it takes to get the chill of poverty out of\r\n      one's bones.' In like manner, we of the living generation,\r\n      when called upon to make grants of thousands of centuries in\r\n      order to explain the events of what is called the modern\r\n      period, shrink naturally at first from making what seems to\r\n      be so lavish an expenditure of past time. Throughout our\r\n      early education we have been accustomed to such strict\r\n      economy in all that relates to the chronology of the earth\r\n      and its inhabitants in remote ages, so fettered have we been\r\n      by old traditional beliefs, that even when our reason is\r\n      convinced and we are persuaded that we ought to make more\r\n      liberal grants of time to the geologist, we feel how hard it\r\n      is to get the chill of poverty out of our bones.\"[138]\r\n\r\nA presidential address to the British Association is no light task; but,\r\nin addition to this, Lyell was now engaged upon a new edition of the\r\n\"Elements (or Manual) of Geology,\" which for some time had been urgently\r\ndemanded; the last edition also of the \"Principles\"--though 5,000 copies\r\nhad been printed--was practically exhausted. The former work was cleared\r\noff before the end of the year, the book appearing in January, 1865, and\r\nthe latter was at once taken vigorously in hand, as we see from a letter\r\nquestioning Sir John Herschel about the earth-pillars on the\r\nRittnerhorn, near Botzen, and on the influence which changes in the\r\nshape of the earth's orbit and the position of its axis would have upon\r\nclimate--a view which had been advocated by Dr. Croll. Lyell, it will be\r\nremembered, had originally regarded geographical conditions as the only\r\nfactors which modified climate, but he was evidently impressed by\r\nCroll's argument, and ready, if his mathematics were correct, to admit\r\nastronomical changes as an independent, though probably less potent,\r\ncause of variation.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1864 and the following New Year were spent in Berlin,\r\nand in the summer of 1865 he had again recourse to Kissingen. Though he\r\nwrites that the waters \"did him neither harm nor good,\" he was at any\r\nrate well enough after the \"cure\" to undertake a rather lengthy tour\r\nwith Lady Lyell and his nephew[139] Leonard, in the course of which he\r\nexamined for himself the wonderful earth-pillars near Botzen, and\r\nvisited the Maerjalen See, that pretty lake held up by the ice of the\r\ngreat Aletsch Glacier, in order to see whether it threw any light on the\r\norigin of the parallel roads of Glenroy. He was satisfied that it did,\r\nfor he found there a large terrace \"exactly on a level with the col\r\nwhich separates the valley\" occupied by the lake from that of the Viesch\r\nglacier. On his return to England, he writes a long letter to Sir John\r\nHerschel, discussing the origin of these earth-pillars, and making\r\ninquiries as to the precise points from which his friend, more than\r\nforty years before, had made some elaborate drawings. The expedition, as\r\nwell as the letter, to quote Lyell's own words, were pretty well for a\r\nman who was \"battling with sixty-eight years.\" He complains, however, of\r\nlittle more than occasional attacks of lumbago, and a necessity for\r\ntaking great care of himself; but his eyes were now more troublesome\r\nthan they had been, and for the last year he had been driven to avail\r\nhimself of the services of a secretary,[140] with the result that he\r\nseemed to have acquired a new lease of his eyes, and to be able, for\r\nordinary purposes, to use them almost as well as formerly.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the Continent Sir Charles was working hard at the\r\nnew edition of the \"Principles,\" which obviously gave him much trouble,\r\nfor letters still remain which were written to Herschel on questions\r\nrelating to climate and astronomy; to Hooker, Wallace, and Darwin on\r\nthe transmutation of species, the distribution and migration of plants\r\nand animals, the effects of geographical changes, and even on such\r\nmatters as the Triassic reptilia of Elgin and Warwickshire, Central\r\nIndia and the Cape. At last the first volume of the new and\r\nmuch-enlarged edition (tenth) was published in November, 1866, the\r\nsecond volume not appearing till 1868. Few men at that time of life\r\ncould have accomplished such a piece of work, especially if they had\r\nbeen compelled, as Lyell was, to read with the eyes and write with the\r\nhands of others. But even now, in regard to field work, he was still\r\nable to see things for himself, and, though less vigorous than formerly,\r\nto undertake journeys of moderate length. In 1866, in company with his\r\nnephew Leonard, he examined the Glacial and late Tertiary deposits of\r\nthe Suffolk coasts; looked once more at the sections of Jurassic rocks\r\nin the Isle of Portland and the neighbourhood of Weymouth, and doubtless\r\nspeculated on the origin of the Chesil Bank and of the Fleet. One honour\r\nfell to him in this year, which, doubtless, only the accident of his\r\nlong service on the Council had previously kept from him--namely, the\r\nWollaston Medal of the Geological Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he was strong enough to visit the Paris Exhibition, after which\r\nhe went to Forfarshire, and attended the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Dundee. In the following year he was present at the same\r\ngathering in Norwich, besides making various shorter journeys in England\r\nand spending September in Pembrokeshire with Lady Lyell and his\r\nbrother's family,[141] in whose company evidently he took much pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1868 he was again in the field, examining the splendid\r\nplant remains of Eocene age in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth and\r\nPoole, and the shallow-water deposits of the Purbeck group ripple-marked\r\nand sun-cracked, together with the traces of their ancient forests. Over\r\nthese he became as enthusiastic as any young geologist. At this time\r\nalso, apparently, he visited the Blackmore Museum[142] at Salisbury, and\r\nhimself found reindeer antlers in the neighbouring gravels at Fisherton.\r\nIn the autumn they again stayed at Tenby with Colonel Lyell's family,\r\nwhen one of the latter was attacked by a serious illness. But Sir\r\nCharles was able to take his nephew Leonard to St. David's, and examine\r\nthe magnificent sections of fossiliferous Cambrian rocks, under the\r\nguidance of Dr. H. Hicks, whose name is inseparably connected with the\r\ngeology of this district.\r\n\r\nComparatively few records are preserved of the last six years of his\r\nlife; still they are enough to show that his interest in science never\r\nflagged. The few letters which have been printed show no signs of\r\ndeclining mental strength. Though his bodily powers had become less\r\nvigorous, though his sight was weak, and his limbs were less firm than\r\nin the olden times, he was by no means ready to be laid altogether on\r\nthe shelf. For instance, in the spring of 1869 he went back to the coast\r\nof Suffolk and Norfolk, to resume work which he had been unable to\r\ncomplete on his last visit.\r\n\r\nStarting at Aldborough, where Pliocene deposits are still exposed, from\r\nthe Coralline Crag up to the Chillesford group, they examined the coasts\r\nby Southwold and Kessingland to Lowestoft, seeing \"a continuous section,\r\nfor miles unbroken, of the deposits from the upper part of the Pliocene\r\nto the glacial drift.\" The Kessingland cliffs afforded good sections of\r\nthe \"Forest Bed,\" the deposit which on former occasions he had studied\r\nin the neighbourhood of Cromer. It was covered by several yards of\r\nstratified sand, and that by glacial drift, \"with the usual 'boulders'\r\nof chalk, flint, lias, sandstone, and other sedimentaries, with\r\ncrystalline rocks from more distant places.\" Passing on into Norfolk,\r\nthey followed this \"Forest Bed\" and the overlying boulder clay, and they\r\nfound in the latter, near Happisburgh, some fragments of sea-shells, and\r\none perfect valve of _Tellina solidula_ in a band of gravel, \"like a\r\nfragment of an old sea-beach,\" intercalated in the glacial clay. As the\r\norigin of this clay has been, of late years, a subject of dispute, it\r\nmay be interesting to quote Sir Charles's conclusion:--\"I suppose,\r\ntherefore, we must set it down as a marine formation; and underneath it,\r\nfrom Happisburgh to Cromer, comes the famous lignite bed and submarine\r\nforest, which must have sunk down to allow of the unquestionable glacial\r\nformation being everywhere superimposed.\"[143]\r\n\r\nOn revisiting Sherringham (a village about five miles along the coast to\r\nthe west of Cromer), he found a striking instance of that \"sea change\"\r\nto which in his early days he had called attention. \"Leonard and I\" (he\r\nwrites to Sir C. Bunbury) \"have just returned from Sherringham, where I\r\nfound that the splendid old Hythe pinnacle of chalk, in which the flints\r\nwere vertical, between seventy and eighty feet high, the grandest\r\nerratic in the world, of which I gave a figure in the first edition of\r\nmy \"Principles,\" has totally disappeared. The sea has advanced on the\r\nlofty cliff so much in the last ten years, that it may well have carried\r\naway the whole pinnacle in the thirty years which have elapsed since our\r\nfirst visit.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter, bearing date in the next month, to Darwin shows that in\r\nhis seventy-second year his mind was fresh and keen as ever. It\r\ndiscusses an article written by Wallace in the _Quarterly Review_, and\r\nindicates the difference in regard to natural selection between Lyell's\r\nown standpoint and that of his correspondent. The following extract may\r\nserve to show the general tenor of the remarks:--\"As I feel that\r\nprogressive development in evolution cannot be entirely explained by\r\nnatural selection, I rather hail Wallace's suggestion that there may be\r\na Supreme Will and Power, which may not abdicate its functions of\r\ninterference, but may guide the forces and laws of Nature.\" In another\r\npassage he refers, to a controversy which had been recently started by\r\nProfessor (afterwards Sir A.) Ramsay, and over which geologists have been\r\nfighting ever since--viz. whether lake-basins are excavated by glaciers.\r\nThe passage is worth quoting, for it puts the issue in a form which\r\nafter a quarter of a century is virtually unchanged:--\r\n\r\n      \"As to the scooping out of lake-basins by glaciers, I have\r\n      had a long, amicable, but controversial correspondence with\r\n      Wallace on that subject, and I cannot get over (as, indeed,\r\n      I have admitted in print) an intimate connection between the\r\n      number of lakes of modern date and the glaciation of the\r\n      regions containing them. But as we do not know how ice can\r\n      scoop out Lago Maggiore to a depth of 2,600 feet, of which\r\n      all but 600 is below the level of the sea, getting rid of\r\n      the rock supposed to be worn away as if it was salt that had\r\n      melted, I feel that it is a dangerous causation to admit in\r\n      explanation of every cavity which we have to account for,\r\n      including Lake Superior. They who use it seem to have it\r\n      always at hand, like the 'diluvial wave or the wave of\r\n      translation,' or the 'convulsion of nature or catastrophe'\r\n      of the old paroxysmists.\"[144]\r\n\r\nIn the summer he took a longer tour, going first to Westmoreland and\r\nthen to Forfarshire; after which, in company with Lady Lyell and his\r\nnephew, he went to see the old rocks of Ross-shire, above Inchnadamff\r\nand Ullapool, and, as he returned, once more visited the parallel roads\r\nof Glenroy.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned above,\r\nhe still kept working at his books. He was now engaged in modifying the\r\n\"Elements of Geology.\" Of this, to quote the preface afterwards\r\npublished, he had published \"six editions between the years 1838 and\r\n1865, beginning with a small duodecimo volume, which increased with each\r\nsuccessive edition, as new facts accumulated, until in 1865 it had\r\nbecome a large and somewhat expensive work.\" He therefore determined, in\r\naccordance with the advice of friends, \"to bring the book back again to\r\na size more nearly approaching the original, so that it might be within\r\nthe reach of the ordinary student.\" This was done by the omission of\r\ncertain theoretical discussions and all such references to Continental\r\ngeology as were not absolutely necessary.[145]\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Sir Charles continued to travel, though within the limits of\r\nthese islands, for he made one journey along the coast of North Devon,\r\nand a second one to Scotland, in the course of which he visited the Isle\r\nof Arran, and on his return halted first at Ambleside and then at\r\nLiverpool, to attend the meeting of the British Association, which began\r\non the 14th of September. The following year he paid an April visit to\r\nTintagel, the Land's End, and other parts of Cornwall, and in the summer\r\nwent to the North of England. Writing from Penrith to Sir C. Bunbury, he\r\nremarks \"that he had much enjoyed his 'tour of inspection,' and had\r\ntried to make it a tour of rest, which is difficult.\" Naturally so, for\r\nhe had been working his way from Buxton on the look-out for glacial\r\ndeposits and studying especially the stratified drifts on the hills east\r\nof Macclesfield, 1,200 feet above the sea. His remarks on these show\r\nthat he appreciated fully both the significance of the marine fossils\r\nwhich they contain and the theoretical difficulties caused by the\r\nabsence of such remains in other deposits, whether in Derbyshire or the\r\nLake District, or in the lowland between this locality and Moel Tryfaen,\r\nseventy-four miles away.\r\n\r\nThe tenth edition of the \"Principles\" had been quickly sold, and Sir\r\nCharles was now employed in the preparation of another one. In this less\r\nchange was necessary than on the last occasion; still, the rapid\r\nincrease of knowledge, more especially in regard to the temperature and\r\ncurrents of the sea, obliged him to make considerable alterations in the\r\nparts which dealt with these subjects and with questions of climate, so\r\nthat he recast or rewrote five chapters.\r\n\r\nIt was published in January, 1872; and in the summer of that year, no\r\ndoubt in view of a new edition of the \"Antiquity of Man,\" he went to the\r\nsouth of France, with Lady Lyell and Professor T. M'K. Hughes, to\r\nexamine the Aurignac cave. Here several human skeletons had been\r\ndiscovered some years before, apparently entombed with the bones of\r\nvarious extinct mammals, such as the cave-bear and lion, the mammoth and\r\nwoolly rhinoceros--in short, with a fauna characteristic of the\r\npalaeolithic age. But was this really the date of the interment? Some\r\ndistinguished geologists were of opinion that, though the cave had been\r\nthen occupied by wild beasts, its floor had been disturbed, and the\r\ncorpses buried in neolithic times. On this point Lyell was unable to\r\nobtain conclusive evidence, and was obliged to confine himself to a\r\nstatement of the facts and arguments on either side of the\r\nquestion.[146]\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of this new edition of the \"Antiquity of\r\nMan\" in January, 1873, an unexpected and irreparable bereavement\r\ndarkened the evening of his days. On April 24th Lady Lyell, the\r\ncompanion and helpmate of forty years, was taken from him after a few\r\ndays' illness from an inflammatory cold.[147] The shock was the more\r\nsevere because the loss was so unforeseen. Lady Lyell was twelve years\r\nhis junior, and had always enjoyed good health[148]--\"youthful and\r\nvigorous for her age,\" as he writes--so that he \"never contemplated\r\nsurviving her, and could hardly believe it when the calamity happened.\"\r\nHe bore the blow bravely, consoling himself by reflecting that the\r\nseparation, at his age--nearly seventy-six--could not be for very long,\r\nand, as he writes to Professor Heer, of Zuerich, endeavouring, \"by daily\r\nwork at my favourite science, to forget as far as possible the dreadful\r\nchange which this has made in my existence.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lyell was a woman of rare excellence. \"Strength and sweetness were\r\nhers, both in no common degree. The daughter of Leonard Horner, and the\r\nniece of Francis Horner, her own excellent understanding had been\r\ncarefully trained, and she had that general knowledge and those\r\nintellectual tastes which we expect to find in an educated Englishwoman;\r\nand from her childhood she had breathed the refining air of taste,\r\nknowledge, and goodness. Her marriage ... gave a scientific turn to her\r\nthoughts and studies, and she became to her husband, not merely the\r\ntruest of friends and the most affectionate and sympathetic of\r\ncompanions, but a very efficient helper. She was frank, generous, and\r\ntrue; her moral instincts were high and pure; she was faithful and firm\r\nin friendship; she was fearless in the expression of opinion without\r\nbeing aggressive; and she had that force of character and quiet energy\r\nof temperament that gave her the power to do all that she had resolved\r\nto do.... She had more than a common share of personal beauty; but had\r\nshe not been beautiful she would have been lovely, such was the charm of\r\nher manners, which were the natural expression of warmth and tenderness\r\nof heart, of quick sympathies, and of a tact as delicate as a blind\r\nman's touch.\"[149]\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, left to bear in solitude the burden of darkening\r\nsight and of a desolated home. His eldest sister, Miss Lyell, came from\r\nKinnordy to take care of his house and watch over him in these last\r\nyears with an affectionate devotion; and in her company and that of\r\nProfessor Hughes he even carried out the plan, which had been already in\r\ncontemplation, of once more going on to the Continent and of visiting\r\nProfessor Heer, at Zuerich.\r\n\r\nHe worked on, as well as slowly increasing infirmities allowed, after\r\nhis return to England, fully occupied in preparing a second edition of\r\nthe \"Student's Elements\" and a new one of the \"Principles.\"[150] In\r\nJune, 1874, he again visited Cambridge, this time to receive the degree\r\nof LL.D.--an honour which that University had been strangely slow in\r\nconferring upon him.[151] It was then too evident that his strength was\r\ndeclining, for he became quickly fatigued by any exertion of body or\r\nmind; nevertheless, he was able soon afterwards to make once more the\r\njourney to Forfarshire, and to visit there several of his earlier\r\ngeological haunts. In some of these little excursions he had as his\r\ncompanion Mr. J. W. Judd,[152] with whose recent researches into the\r\nruined volcanoes of Tertiary age and the yet earlier stratified rocks in\r\nthe Western Isles of Scotland Sir Charles was hardly less interested\r\nthan he would have been in the days when the \"Principles\" was a new\r\nbook. Three or four letters written about this time have been\r\nprinted[153] which show, from their vigour and freshness, that the mind\r\nwas still keen and bright, though the bodily machinery was becoming\r\noutworn. After his return to town he even ventured, on November 5th, to\r\ndine at the Geological Club,[154] of which he had been a member from its\r\nfoundation, on its fiftieth anniversary meeting, and \"spoke with a\r\nvigour which surprised his friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe tale, however, is nearly told; the sands of life were running low.\r\n\"His failing eyesight and other infirmities now began to increase\r\nrapidly, and towards the close of the year he became very feeble. But\r\nhis spirit was ever alive to his old beloved science, and his\r\naffectionate interest and thought for those about him never failed. He\r\ndined downstairs on Christmas Day with his brother's family, but shortly\r\nafter that kept to his room.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, 1875, Charles Lyell entered into his rest. The end may\r\nhave been slightly accelerated by two causes--one, the death, from\r\ninflammation of the lungs, after a short illness, of his brother,[155]\r\nColonel Lyell, who, up to that time, had visited him almost daily; the\r\nother, the shock given to his enfeebled system by accidentally falling\r\non the stairs a few weeks before. But in no case could it have been long\r\ndelayed; the bodily frame was outworn; the hour of rest had come.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-workers in science felt unanimously that but one place of\r\nsepulture was worthy to receive the body of Charles Lyell--the Abbey of\r\nWestminster, our national Valhalla. A memorial, bearing many important\r\nsignatures, was at once presented to Dean Stanley, who gave a willing\r\nconsent, and the interment took place with all due solemnity on Saturday\r\nthe 27th. The grave was dug in the north aisle of the nave, near that of\r\nWoodward, one of the pioneers of British geology and the founder of the\r\nchair of that science in the University of Cambridge. It is marked[156]\r\nby a slab of Derbyshire marble, which bears this inscription:--\r\n\r\n CHARLES LYELL,\r\n BARONET, F.R.S.,\r\n AUTHOR OF\r\n \"THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY.\"\r\n BORN AT KINNORDY, IN FORFARSHIRE,\r\n NOVEMBER 14, 1797;\r\n DIED IN LONDON,\r\n FEBRUARY 22, 1875.\r\n\r\n THROUGHOUT A LONG AND LABORIOUS LIFE\r\n HE SOUGHT THE MEANS OF DECIPHERING\r\n THE FRAGMENTARY RECORDS\r\n OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY\r\n IN THE PATIENT INVESTIGATION\r\n OF THE PRESENT ORDER OF NATURE,\r\n ENLARGING THE BOUNDARIES OF KNOWLEDGE\r\n AND LEAVING ON SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT\r\n AN ENDURING INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n \"O LORD, HOW GREAT ARE THY WORKS,\r\n AND THY THOUGHTS ARE VERY DEEP.\r\n PSALM XCII. 5.\r\n\r\nSir Charles, by his will, left to the Geological Society of London the\r\ndie, executed by Mr. Leonard Wyon, of a medal to be cast in bronze, and\r\nawarded annually to some geologist of distinction, whether British or\r\nforeign. He further left a sum of two thousand pounds, free of legacy\r\nduty, to the Society, in trust, the interest of it to be applied as\r\nfollows:--Not less than one-third of it to accompany the medal, and the\r\nremainder to be given, in one or more portions, for the furtherance of\r\nthe science.

For some years the\r\nbalance of opinion was in favour of an organic origin; now it seems to\r\nbe distinctly tending in the other direction.\r\n\r\n[138] Report of Brit.

He\r\nwould have been a man of commanding presence, if his extremely short\r\nsight had not obliged him to stoop and peer into anything he wished to\r\nobserve. This defect, in addition to the weakness of his eyes was a\r\nserious impediment in field work. As Professor Ramsay remarked in 1851,\r\nafter spending a few days with him in the south of England, he required\r\npeople to point things out to him, and would have been unable to make a\r\ngeological map, \"but understood all when explained, and speculated\r\nthereon well.\"[158] This defect of sight, according to Sir J. W. Dawson,\r\nwho had been his companion in more than one excursion in Canada, was at\r\ntimes even a source of danger. The expression of his face was one of\r\nthoughtful power and gracious benignity.[159] \"In his work, Lyell was\r\nvery methodical, beginning and ending at fixed hours. Accustomed to make\r\nuse of the help of others on account of his weak sight, he was\r\nsingularly unconscious of outward bodily movement, though highly\r\nsensitive to pain. When dictating, he was often restless, moving from\r\nhis chair to his sofa, pacing the room, or sometimes flinging himself\r\nfull length on two chairs, tracing patterns on the floor, as some\r\nthoughtful or eloquent passage flowed from his lips. But though a rapid\r\nwriter and dictator, he was sensitively conscientious in the correction\r\nof his manuscript, partly from a strong sense of the duty of accuracy,\r\npartly from a desire to save his publisher the expense of proof\r\ncorrections. Hence passages once finished were rarely altered, even\r\nafter many years, unless new facts arose.\"\r\n\r\nThe characteristic with which anyone who spent some time in Charles\r\nLyell's company was most impressed, was his thirst for knowledge,\r\ncombined with a singular openness, and perfect fairness of mind. He was\r\nabsolutely free from all petty pride, and from \"that common failing of\r\nmen of science, which causes them to cling with such tenacity to\r\nopinions once formed, even in the face of the strongest evidence.\"[160]\r\nRamsay wrote of him,[161] \"We all like Lyell much; he is anxious for\r\ninstruction, and so far from affecting the bigwig, he is not afraid to\r\nlearn anything from anyone.[162] The notes he takes are amazing.\" No\r\nman could have given a stronger proof of candour and plasticity of mind\r\nand of his care for truth alone than Lyell did in dealing with the\r\nquestion of the origin of species. From the first he approached it\r\nwithout prejudice. So long as the facts adduced by Lamarck and others\r\nappeared to him insufficient to support their hypotheses, he gave the\r\npreference to some modification of the ordinarily accepted view--that a\r\nspecies began in a creative act--but after reading Darwin's classic\r\nwork,[163] and discussing the subject in private, not only with its\r\nauthor, but also with Sir J. Hooker and Professor Huxley, he was\r\nconvinced that Darwin was right in his main contention, though he held\r\nback in regard to certain minor points, for which he thought the\r\nevidence as yet insufficient. Of his conduct in this matter, Darwin\r\njustly wrote: \"Considering his age, his former views, and position in\r\nsociety, I think his action has been heroic.\"[164] Dean Stanley, in the\r\npulpit of Westminster Abbey, on the Sunday following the funeral, summed\r\nup in a few eloquent sentences the great moral lesson of Lyell's life.\r\n\"From early youth to extreme old age it was to him a solemn religious\r\nduty to be incessantly learning, fearlessly correcting his own mistakes,\r\nalways ready to receive and reproduce from others that which he had not\r\nin himself. Science and religion for him not only were not divorced, but\r\nwere one and indivisible.\"[165]\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the truth, and to be led by reason not by impulse, that was\r\nLyell's great aim. Sedgwick once[166] criticised his work in terms\r\nwhich, in one respect, seem to me curiously mistaken: \"Lyell ... is an\r\nexcellent and thoughtful writer, but not, I think, a great field\r\nobserver ... his mind is essentially deductive not inductive.\" The\r\nformer criticism, as has been already admitted, is just, but the latter,\r\n_pace tanti viri_, seems to me the reverse of the truth. Surely there\r\nnever was a geologist whose habits and methods were more strictly\r\ninductive than Lyell's. He would spare no pains, and hardly any expense,\r\nto ascertain for himself what the facts were; he abstained from drawing\r\nany conclusion until he had accumulated a good store; he compared and\r\nmarshalled them, and finally adopted the interpretation with which they\r\nseemed most accordant. This interpretation, however, would be modified,\r\nor even rejected, if new and important facts were discovered. Surely\r\nthis is the method of induction; surely this is the mode of reasoning\r\nadopted by Darwin and by Newton, and even by Bacon himself. But\r\nSedgwick, great man as he was, almost unrivalled in the field, more\r\nbrilliant, though less persevering than Lyell, was not always quite free\r\nfrom prejudices; and it may be noted that he more than once stigmatises\r\nan opinion which he dislikes by declaring it not to be in accordance\r\nwith inductive methods. Sir Joseph Hooker's judgment was far more\r\naccurate: \"One of the most philosophical of geologists, and one of the\r\nbest of men\"[167]; or that of Charles Darwin himself: \"The science of\r\ngeology is enormously indebted to Lyell--more so, as I believe, than to\r\nany other man who ever lived.\"[168]\r\n\r\nLyell felt a keen interest in the broader aspect of political questions,\r\nand this not only in his own country,[169] though he took little or no\r\nshare in party struggles, for the vulgarity of the demagogue and the\r\ncoarseness of the hustings were offensive to a man of such refinement.\r\nHis opinions harmonised with his scientific habits of thought, always\r\nprogressive, but never extravagant. He was in favour of greater freedom\r\nin education, of the restriction of class privileges, and of an\r\nextension of the franchise, but he saw clearly that anything like\r\nuniversal suffrage, as the world is at present constituted, would only\r\nmean giving a preponderating influence to those least competent to wield\r\nit; that is, to the more ignorant and easily deluded. As in such cases\r\nthe glib tongue would become more potent than the voice of reason, the\r\ndemagogue than the statesman, he feared that the standard of national\r\nhonour would be almost inevitably lowered, and national disaster be a\r\nprobable result. That all men are equal and entitled to an equal share\r\nin the government--a dogma now regarded in some circles as almost\r\nsacred--would have been repudiated by him with the quiet scorn of a man\r\nwho prefers facts to fancies, and inductive reasoning to sentimental\r\nrhapsody. A partisan he could not be, for he saw too clearly that in\r\npolitical matters truth and right were seldom a monopoly of any side,\r\nand though by no means wanting in a certain quiet and restrained\r\nenthusiasm, he had almost an abhorrence of fanaticism. One example may\r\nserve for many, to indicate the way in which he regarded both this\r\nspirit and any difficult question. Naturally he had a strong dislike to\r\nslavery; he fully recognised the injustice and wrong to the negro, and\r\nthe evil effects upon the master. Nevertheless, after visiting the\r\nSouthern States, and giving the impressions of his journey, he thus\r\nexpresses himself: \"The more I reflected on the condition of the slaves,\r\nand endeavoured to think on a practical plan for hastening the period of\r\ntheir liberation, the more difficult the subject appeared to me, and the\r\nmore I felt astonished at the confidence displayed by so many\r\nanti-slavery speakers and writers on both sides of the Atlantic. The\r\ncourse pursued by these agitators shows that, next to the positively\r\nwicked, the class who are usually called 'well-meaning persons' are the\r\nmost mischievous in society.\" He then points out how a strong feeling\r\nagainst slavery had been springing up in Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nMaryland; how the emancipation party had been gaining ground, and\r\nslavery steadily retreating southwards, but \"from the moment that the\r\nabolition movement began, and that missionaries were sent to the\r\nSouthern States, a reaction was perceived--the planters took the\r\nalarm--laws were passed against education--the condition of the slave\r\nwas worse, and not a few of the planters, by dint of defending their\r\ninstitutions against the arguments and misrepresentations of their\r\nassailants, came actually to delude themselves into a belief that\r\nslavery was legitimate, wise, and expedient--a positive good in\r\nitself.\"[170] At a subsequent period he speaks of Mrs. Beecher Stowe's\r\nfamous book, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" as \"a gross caricature.\" But in the\r\ngreat struggle between the Northern and Southern States, his sympathies\r\nwent with the former. It was the fairness of his criticisms, and his\r\nhearty appreciation of the good side in American institutions, that won\r\nhim many friends and made his books welcome on that side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nLyell's views on religious questions accorded, as might be expected,\r\nwith the general bent of his mind. He was a member of the Church of\r\nEngland,[171] appreciated its services, the charm of music, and the\r\nbeauty of architecture, but he failed to understand why nonconformity\r\nshould entail penalties, whether legal or social. His mind was\r\nessentially undogmatic; feeling that certainty was impossible in\r\nquestions where the ordinary means of verification could not be\r\nemployed, he abstained from speculation and shrank from formulating his\r\nideas, even when he was convinced of their general truth.\r\n\r\nHe was content, however, to believe where he could not prove, and to\r\ntrust, not faintly, the larger hope. So he worked on in calm confidence\r\nthat the honest searcher after truth would never go far astray, and that\r\nthe God of Nature and of Revelation was one. He sought in this life to\r\nfollow the way of righteousness, justice, and goodness, and he died in\r\nthe hope of immortality.\r\n\r\nAs he disapproved of any approach to persecution on the ground of\r\nreligion, so he objected strongly to the exclusive privileges which in\r\nhis day were enjoyed by the Church of England, especially to its virtual\r\nmonopoly of education. On this point he several times expresses himself\r\nin forcible terms; as, for instance, in these words: \"The Church of\r\nEngland ascendency is really the power which is oppressive here, and not\r\nthe monarchy, nor the aristocracy. Perhaps I feel it too sensitively as\r\na scientific man, since our Puseyites have excluded physical science\r\nfrom Oxford. They are wise in their generation. The abject deference to\r\nauthority advocated conscientiously by them can never survive a sound\r\nphilosophical education.\"[172] To this party--or to the \"Catholic\r\nmovement,\" as it is now often called--in the Church of England, Lyell\r\nhad a strong dislike; he deemed their claims to authority unwarrantable,\r\ntheir practices in many respects either childish or superstitious.\r\n\r\nAs we have endeavoured to bring out in the course of this volume the\r\nguiding principles of Lyell's work, a brief recapitulation only is\r\nneeded as a conclusion. That work was regulated by two maxims: the one,\r\n\"Go and see\"; the other, \"Prefer reason to authority.\" To the first\r\nmaxim he gave expression more than once, while he was always inculcating\r\nit by example. Imitating the well-known saying of Demosthenes in regard\r\nto oratory, he emphatically declares that in order to form\r\ncomprehensive views of the globe, the first, the second, and the third\r\nrequisite is \"travel.\"[173] What he preached, he practised; about a\r\nquarter of the last fifty years of his life must have so been spent. Of\r\nthe second maxim also he was a living example. It was his practice not\r\nonly to see for himself, but also to judge for himself, in all questions\r\nother than those necessarily reserved for specialists; his rule, that\r\nthought should be free from the fear of man, but subject to the laws of\r\nreasoning. As a young man he had advocated, almost single-handed,\r\nscientific views which were unpopular alike with the older authorities\r\nin geology and with the supposed friends of religion; he had protested\r\nagainst the invocation of catastrophic destruction and cataclysmal flood\r\nin order to clear away difficulties in the past history of the earth; in\r\nother words, against an appeal to miracle, when a cause could be found\r\nin the existing order of Nature; and he had disputed the right of any\r\npriesthood, whether Romanist or Protestant, to hold the keys of\r\nknowledge. He vindicated, against all corners, his claim--nay, his\r\nbirthright--to sit, as an earnest student, at the feet of Nature to\r\nlisten and to learn, as she chose to teach, whether by the acted drama\r\nof the living world or by the silent record of the rocks. He was, in\r\nshort, more observer than theorist, more philosopher than poet, more a\r\nservant of reason than a dreamer of dreams.\r\n\r\nHis example is one well worthy of remembrance at the present epoch. The\r\n\"whirligig of time\" has brought its revenges, and has introduced into\r\ngeology a class of students almost unknown in the days when Lyell was\r\nin his vigour. The developments of mineralogy and palaeontology, helpful\r\nand valuable as they have been by making geology more of an exact\r\nscience and, in some cases, substituting order for confusion, have\r\ntended to produce students very familiar with the apparatus of a\r\nlaboratory or the collections of a museum, but not with the face of the\r\nearth. This, in itself, would not be necessarily hurtful, because the\r\nfield of geology is so wide that there is room for all; but it leads\r\nsometimes to an undue exaltation of trifles, to an over-estimation of\r\nthe \"mint, anise, and cummin\" of science, to a waste of time upon what\r\nis called the literature of the subject. This last often means either\r\nsearching much chaff for a few grains of wheat, or spending much labour\r\nwith the hope of discovering whether A or B was the first to confer a\r\nname upon a species; the priority perhaps being only of a few months,\r\nand that name neither particularly appropriate nor euphonious. Partly\r\nfrom this, partly from other causes, the importance, nay, the absolute\r\nnecessity of travel, for the education of a geologist is now too often\r\nforgotten. In this science there are many questions--some of them almost\r\nfundamental--for which no perquisitions in a library, no research in a\r\nlaboratory, no studies in a museum, however conscientiously patient and\r\npainstaking they may be, can be accepted as an adequate preparation;\r\nquestions in which Nature is at once the best book, the best laboratory,\r\nand the best museum, and experience is the only safe teacher. What would\r\nLyell have said to men--and such might now be named--who undertook to\r\ndiscuss wide geological problems with the most limited experience who,\r\nfor example, posed as authorities upon what ice can or cannot do,\r\nwithout having even seen a glacier or speculated on the most intricate\r\nquestions in petrology without having studied more than some corner of\r\nthis island, or, indeed, without any precise knowledge of that? Would\r\nnot he--averse as he was to speaking severely--have censured them for\r\ntalking about things which they could not possibly understand, and for\r\ndarkening counsel by words without knowledge?\r\n\r\nLyell, no doubt, had exceptionally favourable opportunities. The eldest\r\nson of a wealthy man--who contentedly acquiesced in his seeking fame\r\nrather than fortune, and supplied him with the necessary funds--his time\r\nwas his own, as he had not only enough for his ordinary wants, but also\r\ncould afford to travel as much as he desired. His social position was\r\nsufficiently good to facilitate his access to those who had already\r\nattained to eminence. He was blessed with a sympathetic and helpful\r\nwife, and they had no children. Thus they were perfectly free, both in\r\nthe disposal of their time at home and in their peregrinations abroad.\r\nBesides these things they both enjoyed good health. Lyell's constitution\r\nwas not, indeed, so robust that he could take liberties; he had to be\r\ncareful about \"cakes and ale,\" and to lead a fairly regular life,[174]\r\nbut by so doing he was able to be always in good condition for his work.\r\nHis eyes, in fact, were his only trouble and who is there who has not\r\ngot his own \"thorn in the flesh\"? Lyell also was happy in all his\r\ndomestic relations. His letters indicate that all the family--on both\r\nsides--were on affectionate terms, and contain few references to\r\nanxieties and troubles, such as the sickness and death of those dear to\r\nhim, until his life approached the period when such trials become\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThus free from the impediments which have beset many other men of marked\r\nability, such as weak health and physical suffering, the wearing anxiety\r\nof an invalid wife or a sickly family, the harassing cares of pecuniary\r\nlosses or of an insufficient income, Lyell had an exceptional chance.\r\nBut other men have the same and do not use it; they are crippled by this\r\nburden or diverted by that allurement, and \"might have been\" too often\r\nbecomes their epitaph. Lyell never faltered in the course which,\r\ncomparatively early in life, he had marked out for himself. With that\r\nsteady persistency and quiet energy which are characteristic of the\r\nLowland Scot, he put aside all temptations and everything which\r\nthreatened to interfere with his work. While neither recluse nor hermit,\r\nneither churlish nor unsociable, nay, while thoroughly enjoying witty\r\nand intellectual society, he allowed nothing to distract him from his\r\nmain purpose. Convinced that there was a work which he could do, and a\r\nname which he could win, he was willing, for sake of this, to run risks\r\nand to make sacrifices. He did not indeed despise fame, but he never\r\ncondescended to unworthy arts to obtain it; he held that the labourer\r\nwas worthy of his hire, but with him it was always \"the work first, and\r\nthe wage second,\" whether that were coined gold or laurel wreath. He\r\nwas singularly free from all petty jealousies, and ready to learn from\r\nall who could teach him anything, but he was no weakling, swayed by\r\nevery breath of wind, for he reached his conclusions slowly and\r\ncautiously, and never stopped to ask whether they would be popular.\r\n\"Forward, for truth's sake,\" that was the motto of his life.\r\n\r\nIn yet another way was Lyell _felix opportunitate vitae_. In his days,\r\ngeology might be compared to a country which had been for some time\r\ndiscovered but was not yet explored. Settlements had been established\r\nhere and there; in their neighbourhood some ground had been cleared, and\r\na firm base of operations had been secured, but around and beyond was\r\nthe virgin forest, the untrodden land. At almost every step the\r\ntraveller met with some fresh accession to his knowledge or a new\r\nproblem to solve. He could feel the allurement of expectation or the joy\r\nof discovery even in countries otherwise well known; where now he can\r\nhope only to pick up some tiny detail or to plunge into some\r\ninterminable controversy. If he now desires \"fresh fields and pastures\r\nnew,\" he must wander beyond the limits of civilised lands; for within\r\nthese every crag is hammer-marked, and the official geologist is at work\r\nmaking maps. But not only this, Lyell lived in the days when the\r\nliterature of his science was of very modest dimensions. This had its\r\nobvious drawbacks, but it had also its advantages, which, perhaps, were\r\nmore than compensations. At the present day the conscientious student is\r\nin danger of being overwhelmed by the mass of papers, pamphlets and\r\nbooks, from all lands and in all languages--which he is expected, if not\r\nto read, at least to scramble through before venturing to write on any\r\nsubject. Fifty years ago it required a very limited amount of\r\nstudy--often only a few hours' research--to put the geologist in\r\npossession of all that was known, so that he approached his theme very\r\nmuch as a mathematician attacks a problem. This burden of scientific\r\nliterature, seeing that life is short and human strength is limited,\r\nthreatens to stifle the progress of science itself, and we can hardly\r\nventure to expect that any more great generalisations will be made in\r\ngeology or palaeontology, unless a man arise who is daring enough to\r\nsubordinate reading to thinking, and so strong in his grasp of\r\nprinciples that he can make light of details.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes said that Lyell was not an original thinker.\r\nPossibly not; _vixere fortes ante Agamemnona_ is true in science no less\r\nthan in national history; there were mathematicians before Newton,\r\nphilosophic naturalists before Darwin, geologists before Lyell. He did\r\nnot claim to have discovered the principle of uniformity. He tells us\r\nhimself what had been done by his predecessors in Italy and in Scotland:\r\nbut he scattered the mists of error and illusion, he placed the idea\r\nupon a firm and logical basis; in a word, he found uniformitarianism an\r\nhypothesis, and he left it a theory. That surely is a more solid gift to\r\nscience, a better claim to greatness, than any number of brilliant\r\nguesses and fancies, which, after coruscating for a brief season to the\r\namazement of a gaping crowd, explode into darkness, and are no more\r\nseen. But to a certain extent Lyell has thrown his own work into the\r\nshade. The fame of his books causes his numerous scientific papers[175]\r\nto be overlooked; particularly his contributions to the history of\r\ncoalfields and to the classification of the Tertiary deposits. Moreover,\r\ninto these books he was constantly incorporating new and original\r\nmatter. We may be fairly familiar with the \"Principles\" and the\r\n\"Elements,\" but we fail to realise until we have read his \"Life\" and the\r\naccounts of his two tours in America how much those books are made up\r\nfrom the results of actual experience and personal study in the field.\r\n\r\nIt has been also said that Lyell carried the principle of \"uniformity\" a\r\nlittle too far. But, suppose we concede this, does it amount to more\r\nthan the admission that he was human? It is almost inevitable that the\r\ndiscoverer or prophet of a great truth, who has to encounter the storm\r\nand stress of controversy, should state his case a little too strongly,\r\nor should overlook some minor limitation. Suppose we grant that Lyell\r\nwas a little too lavish in his estimate of the time at the disposal of\r\ngeologists. The physicist had not then intervened, with arguments drawn\r\nfrom his own science, to insist that neither earth nor sun can reckon\r\ntheir years by myriads of myriads, and even now this controversy cannot\r\nbe regarded as closed. Suppose we grant that in accepting Hutton's\r\ndictum, \"I find in the earth no signs of a beginning,\" Lyell was misled\r\nby appearances,[176] which have since proved to be delusive, and that\r\nfacts, so far as they go, point rather in the contrary direction. Well,\r\nthis point also is not yet to be regarded as settled; and of one thing,\r\nat any rate, we may be sure, that if Lyell were now living he would\r\nfrankly recognise new facts, as soon as they were established, and would\r\nnot shrink from any modification of his theory which these might demand.\r\nGreat as were his services to geology, this, perhaps, is even\r\ngreater--for the lesson applies to all sciences and to all seekers after\r\nknowledge--that his career, from first to last, was the manifestation of\r\na judicial mind, of a noble spirit, raised far above all party passions\r\nand petty considerations, of an intellect great in itself, but greater\r\nstill in its grand humility; that he was a man to whom truth was as the\r\n'pearl of price,' worthy of the devotion and, if need be, the sacrifice\r\nof a life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] In this paragraph I have ventured to quote largely, and more or\r\nless verbatim, from the words of Miss Buckley (Lyell's secretary) in the\r\narticle on his life, written by my friend Professor G. A. J. Cole, in\r\nthe \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" vol. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[158] \"Life of Sir A. Ramsay,\" by Sir A.

When the second edition of the\r\n\"Student's Elements\" was passing through the press. I ventured to write\r\nto him about one or two petrological details, which I thought might be\r\nmore precise. Though at that time I had published but few papers, I\r\nreceived more than one kind letter with the request that I would read\r\nsome of the proof-sheets of the book and suggest alterations.\r\n\r\n[163] \"The Origin of Species,\" published in 1859.\r\n\r\n[164] \"Life and Letters of C.
