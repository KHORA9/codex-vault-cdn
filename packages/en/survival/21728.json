BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE BACKWOODS SETTLEMENT--CRUSOE'S PARENTAGE AND EARLY HISTORY--THE\r\nAGONISING PAINS AND SORROWS OF HIS PUPPYHOOD, AND OTHER INTERESTING\r\nMATTERS.\r\n\r\nThe dog Crusoe was once a pup.  Now do not, courteous reader, toss your\r\nhead contemptuously, and exclaim, \"Of course he was; I could have told\r\n_you_ that.\"  You know very well that you have often seen a man above\r\nsix feet high, broad and powerful as a lion, with a bronzed shaggy\r\nvisage and the stern glance of an eagle, of whom you have said, or\r\nthought, or heard others say, \"It is scarcely possible to believe that\r\nsuch a man was once a squalling baby.\"  If you had seen our hero in all\r\nthe strength and majesty of full-grown doghood, you would have\r\nexperienced a vague sort of surprise had we told you--as we now repeat--\r\nthat the dog Crusoe was once a pup--a soft, round, sprawling, squeaking\r\npup, as fat as a tallow candle, and as blind as a bat.\r\n\r\nBut we draw particular attention to the fact of Crusoe's having once\r\nbeen a pup, because in connection with the days of his puppyhood there\r\nhangs a tale.  This peculiar dog may thus be said to have had two\r\ntails--one in connection with his body, the other with his career.  This\r\ntale, though short, is very harrowing, and, as it is intimately\r\nconnected with Crusoe's subsequent history, we will relate it here.  But\r\nbefore doing so we must beg our reader to accompany us beyond the\r\ncivilised portions of the United States of America--beyond the frontier\r\nsettlements of the \"far west,\" into those wild prairies which are\r\nwatered by the great Missouri river--the Father of Waters--and his\r\nnumerous tributaries.\r\n\r\nHere dwell the Pawnees, the Sioux, the Delawares, the Crows, the\r\nBlackfeet, and many other tribes of Red Indians, who are gradually\r\nretreating step by step towards the Rocky Mountains as the advancing\r\nwhite man cuts down their trees and ploughs up their prairies.  Here,\r\ntoo, dwell the wild horse and the wild ass, the deer, the buffalo, and\r\nthe badger; all, men and brutes alike, wild as the power of untamed and\r\nungovernable passion can make them, and free as the wind that sweeps\r\nover their mighty plains.\r\n\r\nThere is a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the banks of one\r\nof the tributaries above referred to--a long stretch of mingled woodland\r\nand meadow, with a magnificent lake lying like a gem in its green\r\nbosom--which goes by the name of the Mustang Valley.  This remote vale,\r\neven at the present day, is but thinly peopled by white men, and is\r\nstill a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl\r\ncuriously, and from which the startled deer bounds terrified away.  At\r\nthe period of which we write the valley had just been taken possession\r\nof by several families of squatters, who, tired of the turmoil and the\r\nsquabbles of the then frontier settlements, had pushed boldly into the\r\nfar west to seek a new home for themselves, where they could have \"elbow\r\nroom,\" regardless alike of the dangers they might encounter in unknown\r\nlands and of the Red-skins who dwelt there.\r\n\r\nThe squatters were well armed with axes, rifles, and ammunition.  Most\r\nof the women were used to dangers and alarms, and placed implicit\r\nreliance in the power of their fathers, husbands, and brothers to\r\nprotect them--and well they might, for a bolder set of stalwart men than\r\nthese backwoodsmen never trod the wilderness.  Each had been trained to\r\nthe use of the rifle and the axe from infancy, and many of them had\r\nspent so much of their lives in the woods, that they were more than a\r\nmatch for the Indian in his own peculiar pursuits of hunting and war.\r\nWhen the squatters first issued from the woods bordering the valley, an\r\nimmense herd of wild horses or mustangs were browsing on the plain.\r\nThese no sooner beheld the cavalcade of white men, than, uttering a wild\r\nneigh, they tossed their flowing manes in the breeze and dashed away\r\nlike a whirlwind.  This incident procured the valley its name.\r\n\r\nThe newcomers gave one satisfied glance at their future home, and then\r\nset to work to erect log huts forthwith.  Soon the axe was heard ringing\r\nthrough the forests, and tree after tree fell to the ground, while the\r\noccasional sharp ring of a rifle told that the hunters were catering\r\nsuccessfully for the camp.  In course of time the Mustang Valley began\r\nto assume the aspect of a thriving settlement, with cottages and waving\r\nfields clustered together in the midst of it.\r\n\r\nOf course the savages soon found it out, and paid it occasional visits.\r\nThese dark-skinned tenants of the woods brought furs of wild animals\r\nwith them, which they exchanged with the white men for knives, and\r\nbeads, and baubles and trinkets of brass and tin.  But they hated the\r\n\"Pale-faces\" with bitter hatred, because their encroachments had at this\r\ntime materially curtailed the extent of their hunting grounds, and\r\nnothing but the numbers and known courage of the squatters prevented\r\nthese savages from butchering and scalping them all.\r\n\r\nThe leader of this band of pioneers was a Major Hope, a gentleman whose\r\nlove for nature in its wildest aspects determined him to exchange\r\nbarrack life for a life in the woods.  The major was a first-rate shot,\r\na bold, fearless man, and an enthusiastic naturalist.  He was past the\r\nprime of life, and, being a bachelor, was unencumbered with a family.\r\nHis first act on reaching the site of the new settlement was to commence\r\nthe erection of a block-house, to which the people might retire in case\r\nof a general attack by the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn this block-house Major Hope took up his abode as the guardian of the\r\nsettlement,--and here the dog Crusoe was born; here he sprawled in the\r\nearly morn of life; here he leaped, and yelped, and wagged his shaggy\r\ntail in the excessive glee of puppyhood, and from the wooden portals of\r\nthis block-house he bounded forth to the chase in all the fire, and\r\nstrength, and majesty of full-grown doghood.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's father and mother were magnificent Newfoundlanders.  There was\r\nno doubt as to their being of the genuine breed, for Major Hope had\r\nreceived them as a parting gift from a brother officer, who had brought\r\nthem both from Newfoundland itself.  The father's name was Crusoe; the\r\nmother's name was Fan.  Why the father had been so called no one could\r\ntell.  The man from whom Major Hope's friend had obtained the pair was a\r\npoor, illiterate fisherman, who had never heard of the celebrated\r\n\"Robinson\" in all his life.  All he knew was that Fan had been named\r\nafter his own wife.  As for Crusoe, he had got him from a friend, who\r\nhad got him from another friend, whose cousin had received him as a\r\nmarriage gift from a friend of _his_; and that each had said to the\r\nother that the dog's name was \"Crusoe,\" without reasons being asked or\r\ngiven on either side.  On arriving at New York the major's friend, as we\r\nhave said, made him a present of the dogs.  Not being much of a dog\r\nfancier, he soon tired of old Crusoe, and gave him away to a gentleman,\r\nwho took him down to Florida, and that was the end of him.  He was never\r\nheard of more.\r\n\r\nWhen Crusoe, junior, was born, he was born, of course, without a name.\r\nThat was given to him afterwards in honour of his father.  He was also\r\nborn in company with a brother and two sisters, all of whom drowned\r\nthemselves accidentally, in the first month of their existence, by\r\nfalling into the river which flowed past the block-house,--a calamity\r\nwhich occurred, doubtless, in consequence of their having gone out\r\nwithout their mother's leave.  Little Crusoe was with his brother and\r\nsisters at the time, and fell in along with them, but was saved from\r\nsharing their fate by his mother, who, seeing what had happened, dashed\r\nwith an agonised howl into the water, and, seizing him in her mouth,\r\nbrought him ashore in a half-drowned condition.  She afterwards brought\r\nthe others ashore one by one, but the poor little things were dead.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the harrowing part of our tale, for the proper\r\nunderstanding of which the foregoing dissertation was needful.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful afternoon, in that charming season of the American year\r\ncalled the Indian summer, there came a family of Sioux Indians to the\r\nMustang Valley, and pitched their tent close to the block-house.  A\r\nyoung hunter stood leaning against the gate-post of the palisades,\r\nwatching the movements of the Indians, who, having just finished a long\r\n\"palaver\" or \"talk\" with Major Hope, were now in the act of preparing\r\nsupper.  A fire had been kindled on the green sward in front of the\r\ntent, and above it stood a tripod, from which depended a large tin\r\ncamp-kettle.  Over this hung an ill-favoured Indian woman, or squaw,\r\nwho, besides attending to the contents of the pot, bestowed sundry cuffs\r\nand kicks upon her little child, which sat near to her playing with\r\nseveral Indian curs that gambolled round the fire.  The master of the\r\nfamily and his two sons reclined on buffalo robes, smoking their stone\r\npipes or calumets in silence.  There was nothing peculiar in their\r\nappearance.  Their faces were neither dignified nor coarse in\r\nexpression, but wore an aspect of stupid apathy, which formed a striking\r\ncontrast to the countenance of the young hunter, who seemed an amused\r\nspectator of their proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe youth referred to was very unlike, in many respects, to what we are\r\naccustomed to suppose a backwoods hunter should be.  He did not possess\r\nthat quiet gravity and staid demeanour which often characterise these\r\nmen.  True, he was tall and strongly made, but no one would have called\r\nhim stalwart, and his frame indicated grace and agility rather than\r\nstrength.  But the point about him which rendered him different from his\r\ncompanions was his bounding, irrepressible flow of spirits, strangely\r\ncoupled with an intense love of solitary wandering in the woods.  None\r\nseemed so well fitted for social enjoyment as he; none laughed so\r\nheartily, or expressed such glee in his mischief-loving eye; yet for\r\ndays together he went off alone into the forest, and wandered where his\r\nfancy led him, as grave and silent as an Indian warrior.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there was nothing mysterious in this.  The boy followed\r\nimplicitly the dictates of nature within him.  He was amiable,\r\nstraightforward, sanguine, and intensely _earnest_.  When he laughed he\r\nlet it out, as sailors have it, \"with a will.\"  When there was good\r\ncause to be grave, no power on earth could make him smile.  We have\r\ncalled him boy, but in truth he was about that uncertain period of life\r\nwhen a youth is said to be neither a man nor a boy.  His face was\r\ngood-looking (_every_ earnest, candid face is) and masculine; his hair\r\nwas reddish-brown, and his eye bright blue.  He was costumed in the\r\ndeerskin cap, leggings, moccasins, and leathern shirt common to the\r\nwestern hunter.\r\n\r\n\"You seem tickled wi' the Injuns, Dick Varley,\" said a man who at that\r\nmoment issued from the block-house.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I am, Joe Blunt,\" replied the youth, turning with a\r\nbroad grin to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, lad; do not laugh at 'em too much.  They soon take\r\noffence; an' them Red-skins never forgive.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm only laughing at the baby,\" returned the youth, pointing to the\r\nchild, which, with a mixture of boldness and timidity, was playing with\r\na pup, wrinkling up its fat visage into a smile when its playmate rushed\r\naway in sport, and opening wide its jet-black eyes in grave anxiety as\r\nthe pup returned at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\"It 'ud make an owl laugh,\" continued young Varley, \"to see such a queer\r\npictur' o' itself.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused suddenly, and a dark frown covered his face as he saw the\r\nIndian woman stoop quickly down, catch the pup by its hind-leg with one\r\nhand, seize a heavy piece of wood with the other, and strike it several\r\nviolent blows on the throat.  Without taking the trouble to kill the\r\npoor animal outright, the savage then held its still writhing body over\r\nthe fire in order to singe off the hair before putting it into the pot\r\nto be cooked.\r\n\r\nThe cruel act drew young Varley's attention more closely to the pup, and\r\nit flashed across his mind that this could be no other than young\r\nCrusoe, which neither he nor his companion had before seen, although\r\nthey had often heard others speak of and describe it.\r\n\r\nHad the little creature been one of the unfortunate Indian curs, the two\r\nhunters would probably have turned from the sickening sight with\r\ndisgust, feeling that, however much they might dislike such cruelty, it\r\nwould be of no use attempting to interfere with Indian usages.  But the\r\ninstant the idea that it was Crusoe occurred to Varley he uttered a yell\r\nof anger, and sprang towards the woman with a bound that caused the\r\nthree Indians to leap to their feet and grasp their tomahawks.\r\n\r\nBlunt did not move from the gate, but threw forward his rifle with a\r\ncareless motion, but an expressive glance, that caused the Indians to\r\nresume their seats and pipes with an emphatic \"Wah!\" of disgust at\r\nhaving been startled out of their propriety by a trifle, while Dick\r\nVarley snatched poor Crusoe from his dangerous and painful position,\r\nscowled angrily in the woman's face, and, turning on his heel, walked up\r\nto the house, holding the pup tenderly in his arms.\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt gazed after his friend with a grave, solemn expression of\r\ncountenance till he disappeared; then he looked at the ground and shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nJoe was one of the regular out-and-out backwoods hunters, both in\r\nappearance and in fact--broad, tall, massive, lion-like,--gifted with\r\nthe hunting, stalking, running, and trail--following powers of the\r\nsavage, and with a superabundance of the shooting and fighting powers,\r\nthe daring and dash of the Anglo-Saxon.  He was grave, too seldom\r\nsmiled, and rarely laughed.  His expression almost at all times was a\r\ncompound of seriousness and good-humour.  With the rifle he was a good,\r\nsteady shot; but by no means a \"crack\" one.  _His_ ball never failed to\r\n_hit_, but it often failed to kill.\r\n\r\nAfter meditating a few seconds, Joe Blunt again shook his head, and\r\nmuttered to himself; \"The boy's bold enough, but he's too reckless for a\r\nhunter.  There was no need for that yell, now--none at all.\"\r\n\r\nHaving uttered this sagacious remark, he threw his rifle into the hollow\r\nof his left arm, turned round, and strode off with a long, slow step\r\ntowards his own cottage.\r\n\r\nBlunt was an American by birth, but of Irish extraction, and to an\r\nattentive ear there was a faint echo of the _brogue_ in his tone, which\r\nseemed to have been handed down to him as a threadbare and almost\r\nworn-out heirloom.\r\n\r\nPoor Crusoe was singed almost naked.  His wretched tail seemed little\r\nbetter than a piece of wire filed off to a point, and he vented his\r\nmisery in piteous squeaks as the sympathetic Varley confided him\r\ntenderly to the care of his mother.  How Fan managed to cure him no one\r\ncan tell, but cure him she did, for, in the course of a few weeks,\r\nCrusoe was as well, and sleek, and fat as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nA SHOOTING MATCH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--NEW FRIENDS INTRODUCED TO THE\r\nREADER--CRUSOE AND HIS MOTHER CHANGE MASTERS.\r\n\r\nShortly after the incident narrated in the last chapter, the squatters\r\nof the Mustang Valley lost their leader.  Major Hope suddenly announced\r\nhis intention of quitting the settlement, and returning to the civilised\r\nworld.  Private matters, he said, required his presence there--matters\r\nwhich he did not choose to speak of but which would prevent his\r\nreturning again to reside among them.  Go he must, and, being a man of\r\ndetermination, go he did; but before going he distributed all his goods\r\nand chattels among the settlers.  He even gave away his rifle, and Fan,\r\nand Crusoe.  These last, however, he resolved should go together; and as\r\nthey were well worth having, he announced that he would give them to the\r\nbest shot in the valley.  He stipulated that the winner should escort\r\nhim to the nearest settlement eastward, after which he might return with\r\nthe rifle on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a long level piece of ground on the river's bank, with a\r\nperpendicular cliff at the end of it, was selected as the shooting\r\nground, and, on the appointed day, at the appointed hour, the\r\ncompetitors began to assemble.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lad, first as usual,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, as he reached the\r\nground and found Dick Varley there before him.\r\n\r\n\"I've bin here more than an hour lookin' for a new kind o' flower that\r\nJack Morgan told me he'd seen.  And I've found it too.  Look here; did\r\nyou ever see one like it before?\"\r\n\r\nBlunt leaned his rifle against a tree, and carefully examined the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, I've seed a-many o' them up about the Rocky Mountains, but\r\nnever one here-away.  It seems to have gone lost itself.  The last I\r\nseed, if I remimber rightly, wos near the head-waters o' the Yellowstone\r\nRiver, it wos--jest where I shot a grizzly bar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that the bar that gave you the wipe on the cheek?\" asked Varley,\r\nforgetting the flower in his interest about the bear.\r\n\r\n\"It was.  I put six balls in that bar's carcase, and stuck my knife into\r\nits heart ten times afore it gave out; an' it nearly ripped the shirt\r\noff my back afore I was done with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would give my rifle to get a chance at a grizzly!\" exclaimed Varley,\r\nwith a sudden burst of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever got it wouldn't have much to brag of,\" remarked a burly young\r\nbackwoodsman, as he joined them.\r\n\r\nHis remark was true, for poor Dick's weapon was but a sorry affair.  It\r\nmissed fire, and it hung fire, and even when it did fire it remained a\r\nmatter of doubt in its owner's mind whether the slight deviations from\r\nthe direct line made by his bullets were the result of _his_ or _its_\r\nbad shooting.\r\n\r\nFurther comment upon it was checked by the arrival of a dozen or more\r\nhunters on the scene of action.  They were a sturdy set of bronzed,\r\nbold, fearless men, and one felt, on looking at them, that they would\r\nprove more than a match for several hundreds of Indians in open fight.\r\nA few minutes after, the major himself came on the ground with the prize\r\nrifle on his shoulder, and Fan and Crusoe at his heels--the latter\r\ntumbling, scrambling, and yelping after its mother, fat and clumsy, and\r\nhappy as possible, having evidently quite forgotten that it had been\r\nnearly roasted alive only a few weeks before.\r\n\r\nImmediately all eyes were on the rifle, and its merits were discussed\r\nwith animation.\r\n\r\nAnd well did it deserve discussion, for such a piece had never before\r\nbeen seen on the western frontier.  It was shorter in the barrel and\r\nlarger in the bore than the weapons chiefly in vogue at that time, and,\r\nbesides being of beautiful workmanship, was silver-mounted.  But the\r\ngrand peculiarity about it, and that which afterwards rendered it the\r\nmystery of mysteries to the savages, was, that it had two sets of\r\nlocks--one percussion, the other flint--so that, when caps failed, by\r\ntaking off the one set of locks and affixing the others, it was\r\nconverted into a flint-rifle.  The major, however, took care never to\r\nrun short of caps, so that the flint locks were merely held as a reserve\r\nin case of need.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" cried Major Hope, stepping up to the point whence they were\r\nto shoot, \"remember the terms.  He who first drives the nail obtains the\r\nrifle, Fan, and her pup, and accompanies me to the nearest settlements.\r\nEach man shoots with his own gun, and draws lots for the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" cried the men.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, wipe your guns and draw lots.  Henri will fix the nail.\r\nHere it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe individual who stepped, or rather plunged forward to receive the\r\nnail was a rare and remarkable specimen of mankind.  Like his comrades,\r\nhe was half a farmer and half a hunter.  Like them, too, he was clad in\r\ndeerskin, and was tall and strong--nay, more, he was gigantic.  But,\r\nunlike them, he was clumsy, awkward, loose-jointed, and a bad shot.\r\nNevertheless Henri was an immense favourite in the settlement, for his\r\ngood-humour knew no bounds.  No one ever saw him frown.  Even when\r\nfighting with the savages, as he was sometimes compelled to do in\r\nself-defence, he went at them with a sort of jovial rage that was almost\r\nlaughable.  Inconsiderate recklessness was one of his chief\r\ncharacteristics, so that his comrades were rather afraid of him on the\r\nwar-trail or in the hunt, where caution, and frequently _soundless_\r\nmotion, were essential to success or safety.  But when Henri had a\r\ncomrade at his side to check him he was safe enough, being humble-minded\r\nand obedient.  Men used to say he must have been born under a lucky\r\nstar, for, notwithstanding his natural inaptitude for all sorts of\r\nbackwoods life, he managed to scramble through everything with safety,\r\noften with success, and sometimes with credit.\r\n\r\nTo see Henri stalk a deer was worth a long day's journey.  Joe Blunt\r\nused to say he was \"all jints together, from the top of his head to the\r\nsole of his moccasin.\"  He threw his immense form into the most\r\ninconceivable contortions, and slowly wound his way, sometimes on hands\r\nand knees, sometimes flat, through bush and brake, as if there was not a\r\nbone in his body, and without the slightest noise.  This sort of work\r\nwas so much against his plunging nature, that he took long to learn it,\r\nbut when, through hard practice and the loss of many a fine deer, he\r\ncame at length to break himself in to it, he gradually progressed to\r\nperfection, and ultimately became the best stalker in the valley.  This,\r\nand this alone, enabled him to procure game, for, being short-sighted,\r\nhe could hit nothing beyond fifty yards, except a buffalo or a barn\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nYet that same lithe body, which seemed as though totally unhinged, could\r\nno more be bent, when the muscles were strung, than an iron post.  No\r\none wrestled with Henri unless he wished to have his back broken.  Few\r\ncould equal and none could beat him at running or leaping except Dick\r\nVarley.  When Henri ran a race even Joe Blunt laughed outright, for arms\r\nand legs went like independent flails.  When he leaped, he hurled\r\nhimself into space with a degree of violence that seemed to insure a\r\nsomersault--yet he always came down with a crash on his feet.  Plunging\r\nwas Henri's forte.  He generally lounged about the settlement, when\r\nunoccupied, with his hands behind his back, apparently in a reverie, and\r\nwhen called on to act, he seemed to fancy he must have lost time, and\r\ncould only make up for it by _plunging_.  This habit got him into many\r\nawkward scrapes, but his herculean power as often got him out of them.\r\nHe was a French-Canadian, and a particularly bad speaker of the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe offer no apology for this elaborate introduction of Henri, for he was\r\nas good-hearted a fellow as ever lived, and deserves special notice.\r\n\r\nBut to return.  The sort of rifle practice called \"driving the nail,\" by\r\nwhich this match was to be decided, was, and we believe still is, common\r\namong the hunters of the far west.  It consisted in this,--an ordinary\r\nlarge-headed nail was driven a short way into a plank or a tree, and the\r\nhunters, standing at a distance of fifty yards or so, fired at it until\r\nthey succeeded in driving it home.  On the present occasion the major\r\nresolved to test their shooting by making the distance seventy yards.\r\n\r\nSome of the older men shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\"It's too far,\" said one; \"ye might as well try to snuff the nose o' a\r\nmosquito.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim Scraggs is the only man as'll hit that,\" said another.\r\n\r\nThe man referred to was a long, lank, lantern-jawed fellow with a\r\ncross-grained expression of countenance.  He used the long, heavy,\r\nKentucky rifle, which, from the ball being little larger than a pea, was\r\ncalled a pea-rifle.  Jim was no favourite, and had been named Scraggs by\r\nhis companions on account of his appearance.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the lots were drawn, and the shooting began.  Each\r\nhunter wiped out the barrel of his piece with his ramrod as he stepped\r\nforward; then, placing a ball in the palm of his left hand, he drew the\r\nstopper of his powder-horn with his teeth, and poured out as much powder\r\nas sufficed to cover the bullet.  This was the regular _measure_ among\r\nthem.  Little time was lost in firing, for these men did not \"hang\" on\r\ntheir aim.  The point of the rifle was slowly raised to the object, and,\r\nthe instant the sight covered it, the ball sped to its mark.  In a few\r\nminutes the nail was encircled by bullet-holes, scarcely two of which\r\nwere more than an inch distant from the mark, and one--fired by Joe\r\nBlunt--entered the tree close beside it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Joe!\" said the major, \"I thought you would have carried off the\r\nprize.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did not I, sir,\" returned Blunt, with a shake of his head.  \"Had it\r\na-bin a half-dollar at a hundred yards, I'd ha' done better, but I never\r\n_could_ hit the nail.  It's too small to _see_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's cos ye've got no eyes,\" remarked Jim Scraggs, with a sneer, as\r\nhe stepped forward.\r\n\r\nAll tongues were now hushed, for the expected champion was about to\r\nfire.  The sharp crack of the rifle was followed by a shout, for Jim had\r\nhit the nail-head on the edge, and part of the bullet stuck to it.\r\n\r\n\"That wins if there's no better,\" said the major, scarce able to conceal\r\nhis disappointment.  \"Who comes next?\"\r\n\r\nTo this question Henri answered by stepping up to the line, straddling\r\nhis legs, and executing preliminary movements with his rifle, that\r\nseemed to indicate an intention on his part to throw the weapon bodily\r\nat the mark.  He was received with a shout of mingled laughter and\r\napplause.  After gazing steadily at the mark for a few seconds, a broad\r\ngrin overspread his countenance, and, looking round at his companions,\r\nhe said--\"Ha! mes boys, I cannot behold de nail at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can ye `behold' the _tree_?\" shouted a voice, when the laugh that\r\nfollowed this announcement had somewhat abated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oui,\" replied Henri quite coolly; \"I can see _him_, an' a goot\r\nsmall bit of de forest beyond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire at it, then.  If ye hit the tree ye desarve the rifle--leastwise\r\nye ought to get the pup.\"\r\n\r\nHenri grinned again, and fired instantly, without taking aim.\r\n\r\nThe shot was followed by an exclamation of surprise, for the bullet was\r\nfound close beside the nail!\r\n\r\n\"It's more be good luck than good shootin',\" remarked Jim Scraggs.\r\n\r\n\"Possiblement,\" answered Henri modestly, as he retreated to the rear and\r\nwiped out his rifle; \"mais I have kill most of my deer by dat same goot\r\nluck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!  Henri,\" said Major Hope as he passed; \"you _deserve_ to win,\r\nanyhow.  Who's next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick Varley,\" cried several voices; \"where's Varley?  Come on,\r\nyoungster, an' take yer shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth came forward with evident reluctance.  \"It's of no manner o'\r\nuse,\" he whispered to Joe Blunt as he passed, \"I can't depend on my old\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never give in,\" whispered Blunt encouragingly.  Poor Varley's want of\r\nconfidence in his rifle was merited, for, on pulling the trigger, the\r\nfaithless lock missed fire.\r\n\r\n\"Lend him another gun,\" cried several voices.  \"'Gainst rules laid down\r\nby Major Hope,\" said Scraggs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so it is; try again.\"\r\n\r\nVarley did try again, and so successfully, too, that the ball hit the\r\nnail on the head, leaving a portion of the lead sticking to its edge.\r\n\r\nOf course this was greeted with a cheer, and a loud dispute began as to\r\nwhich was the better shot of the two.\r\n\r\n\"There are others to shoot yet,\" cried the major.  \"Make way.  Look\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe men fell back, and the few hunters who had not yet fired took their\r\nshots, but without coming nearer the mark.\r\n\r\nIt was now agreed that Jim Scraggs and Dick Varley, being the two best\r\nshots, should try over again; and it was also agreed that Dick should\r\nhave the use of Blunt's rifle.  Lots were again drawn for the first\r\nshot, and it fell to Dick, who immediately stepped out, aimed somewhat\r\nhastily, and fired.\r\n\r\n\"Hit again!\" shouted those who had run forward to examine the mark.\r\n\"_Half_ the bullet cut off by the nail-head!\"\r\n\r\nSome of the more enthusiastic of Dick's friends cheered lustily, but the\r\nmost of the hunters were grave and silent, for they knew Jim's powers,\r\nand felt that he would certainly do his best.  Jim now stepped up to the\r\nline, and, looking earnestly at the mark, threw forward his rifle.\r\n\r\nAt that moment our friend Crusoe--tired of tormenting his mother--\r\nwaddled stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of men, and,\r\nin so doing, received Henri's heel and the full weight of his\r\nelephantine body on its fore-paw.  The horrible and electric yell that\r\ninstantly issued from his agonised throat could only be compared, as Joe\r\nBlunt expressed it, \"to the last dyin' screech o' a bustin' steam\r\nbiler!\"  We cannot say that the effect was startling, for these\r\nbackwoodsmen had been born and bred in the midst of alarms, and were so\r\nused to them that a \"bustin' steam biler\" itself, unless it had blown\r\nthem fairly off their legs, would not have startled them.  But the\r\neffect, such as it was, was sufficient to disconcert the aim of Jim\r\nScraggs, who fired at the same instant, and missed the nail by a\r\nhair's-breadth.\r\n\r\nTurning round in towering wrath, Scraggs aimed a kick at the poor pup,\r\nwhich, had it taken effect, would certainly have terminated the innocent\r\nexistence of that remarkable dog on the spot, but quick as lightning\r\nHenri interposed the butt of his rifle, and Jim's shin met it with a\r\nviolence that caused him to howl with rage and pain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! pardon me, broder,\" cried Henri, shrinking back, with the drollest\r\nexpression of mingled pity and glee.\r\n\r\nJim's discretion, on this occasion, was superior to his valour; he\r\nturned away with a coarse expression of anger and left the ground.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the major handed the silver rifle to young Varley.  \"It\r\ncouldn't have fallen into better hands,\" he said.  \"You'll do it credit,\r\nlad, I know that full well, and let me assure you it will never play you\r\nfalse.  Only keep it clean, don't overcharge it, aim true, and it will\r\nnever miss the mark.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the hunters crowded round Dick to congratulate him and examine the\r\npiece, he stood with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at his\r\nunexpected good fortune.  Recovering himself suddenly he seized his old\r\nrifle, and, dropping quietly to the outskirts of the crowd, while the\r\nmen were still busy handling and discussing the merits of the prize,\r\nwent up, unobserved, to a boy of about thirteen years of age, and\r\ntouched him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Marston, you know I often said ye should have the old rifle when\r\nI was rich enough to get a new one.  Take it _now_, lad.  It's come to\r\nye sooner than either o' us expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" said the boy, grasping his friend's hand warmly, \"yer true as\r\nheart of oak.  It's good of 'ee, that's a fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit, boy; it costs me nothin' to give away an old gun that I've\r\nno use for, an's worth little, but it makes me right glad to have the\r\nchance to do it.\"\r\n\r\nMarston had longed for a rifle ever since he could walk, but his\r\nprospects of obtaining one were very poor indeed at that time, and it is\r\na question whether he did not at that moment experience as much joy in\r\nhandling the old piece as his friend felt in shouldering the prize.\r\n\r\nA difficulty now occurred which had not before been thought of.  This\r\nwas no less than the absolute refusal of Dick Varley's canine property\r\nto follow him.  Fan had no idea of changing masters without her consent\r\nbeing asked, or her inclination being consulted.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to tie her up for a while, I fear,\" said the major.\r\n\r\n\"No fear,\" answered the youth.  \"Dog natur's like human natur'!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he seized Crusoe by the neck, stuffed him comfortably into\r\nthe bosom of his hunting shirt, and walked rapidly away with the prize\r\nrifle on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nFan had not bargained for this.  She stood irresolute, gazing now to the\r\nright and now to the left, as the major retired in one direction and\r\nDick with Crusoe in another.  Suddenly Crusoe, who, although comfortable\r\nin body, was ill at ease in spirit, gave utterance to a melancholy howl.\r\nThe mother's love instantly prevailed.  For one moment she pricked up\r\nher ears at the sound, and then, lowering them, trotted quietly after\r\nher new master, and followed him to his cottage on the margin of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nSPECULATIVE REMARKS WITH WHICH THE READER MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE--AN OLD\r\nWOMAN--HOPES AND WISHES COMMINGLED WITH HARD FACTS--THE DOG CRUSOE'S\r\nEDUCATION BEGUN.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to look upon a serene, quiet, humble face.  On such a\r\nface did Richard Varley look every night when he entered his mother's\r\ncottage.  Mrs Varley was a widow, and she had followed the fortunes of\r\nher brother, Daniel Hood, ever since the death of her husband.  Love for\r\nher only brother induced her to forsake the peaceful village of\r\nMaryland, and enter upon the wild life of a backwoods settlement.\r\nDick's mother was thin, and old, and wrinkled, but her face was stamped\r\nwith a species of beauty which _never_ fades--the beauty of a loving\r\nlook.  Ah! the brow of snow and the peach-bloom cheek may snare the\r\nheart of man for a time, but the _loving look_ alone can forge that\r\nadamantine chain that time, age, eternity, shall never break.\r\n\r\nMistake us not, reader, and bear with us if we attempt to analyse this\r\nlook which characterised Mrs Varley.  A rare diamond is worth stopping\r\nto glance at, even when one is in a hurry!  The brightest jewel in the\r\nhuman heart is worth a thought or two!  By a _loving look_, we do not\r\nmean a look of love bestowed on a beloved object.  That is common\r\nenough, and thankful should we be that it is so common in a world that's\r\nover-full of hatred.  Still less do we mean that smile and look of\r\nintense affection with which some people--good people too--greet friends\r\nand foe alike, and by which effort to work out their _beau ideal_ of the\r\nexpression of Christian love, they do signally damage their cause, by\r\nsaddening the serious and repelling the gay.  Much less do we mean that\r\n_perpetual_ smile of good-will which argues more of personal comfort and\r\nself-love than anything else.  No, the loving look we speak of is as\r\noften grave as gay.  Its character depends very much on the face through\r\nwhich it beams.  And it cannot be counterfeited.  Its _ring_ defies\r\nimitation.  Like the clouded sun of April, it can pierce through tears\r\nof sorrow; like the noontide sun of summer, it can blaze in warm smiles;\r\nlike the northern lights of winter, it can gleam in depths of woe--but\r\nit is always the same, modified, doubtless, and rendered more or less\r\npatent to others, according to the natural amiability of him or her who\r\nbestows it.  No one can put it on.  Still less can any one put it off.\r\nIts range is universal; it embraces all mankind, though, _of course_, it\r\nis intensified on a few favoured objects; its seat is in the depths of a\r\nrenewed heart, and its foundation lies in love to God.\r\n\r\nYoung Varley's mother lived in a cottage which was of the smallest\r\npossible dimensions consistent with comfort.  It was made of logs, as,\r\nindeed, were all the other cottages in the valley.  The door was in the\r\ncentre, and a passage from it to the back of the dwelling divided it\r\ninto two rooms.  One of these was subdivided by a thin partition, the\r\ninner room being Mrs Varley's bedroom, the outer Dick's.  Daniel Hood's\r\ndormitory was a corner of the kitchen, which apartment served also as a\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were lighted by two windows, one on each side of the door,\r\nwhich gave to the house the appearance of having a nose and two eyes.\r\nHouses of this kind have literally got a sort of _expression_ on--if we\r\nmay use the word--their countenances.  _Square_ windows give the\r\nappearance of easy-going placidity; _longish_ ones, that of surprise.\r\nMrs Varley's was a surprised cottage, and this was in keeping with the\r\nscene in which it stood, for the clear lake in front, studded with\r\nislands, and the distant hills beyond, composed a scene so surprisingly\r\nbeautiful that it never failed to call forth an expression of astonished\r\nadmiration from every new visitor to the Mustang Valley.\r\n\r\n\"My boy,\" exclaimed Mrs Varley, as her son entered the cottage with a\r\nbound, \"why so hurried to-day?  Deary me! where got you the grand gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Won it, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Won it, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, won it, mother.  Druve the nail _almost_, and would ha' druve it\r\n_altogether_ had I bin more used to Joe Blunt's rifle.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Varley's heart beat high, and her face flushed with pride as she\r\ngazed at her son, who laid the rifle on the table for her inspection,\r\nwhile he rattled off an animated and somewhat disjointed account of the\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n\"Deary me! now that was good; that was cliver.  But what's that scraping\r\nat the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's Fan; I forgot her.  Here! here!  Fan!  Come in, good dog,\"\r\nhe cried rising and opening the door.\r\n\r\nFan entered and stopped short, evidently uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"My boy, what do ye with the major's dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Won her too, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Won her, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, won her, and the pup too; see, here it is!\" and he plucked Crusoe\r\nfrom his bosom.\r\n\r\nCrusoe, having found his position to be one of great comfort, had fallen\r\ninto a profound slumber, and on being thus unceremoniously awakened, he\r\ngave forth a yelp of discontent that brought Fan in a state of frantic\r\nsympathy to his side.\r\n\r\n\"There you are, Fan, take it to a corner and make yourself at home.  Ay,\r\nthat's right, mother, give her somethin' to eat; she's hungry, I know by\r\nthe look o' her eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deary me, Dick,\" said Mrs Varley, who now proceeded to spread the\r\nyouth's mid-day meal before him, \"did ye drive the nail three times?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only once, and that not parfetly.  Brought 'em all down at one\r\nshot--rifle, Fan, an' pup!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, now that was cliver; but--\" Here the old woman paused and\r\nlooked grave.\r\n\r\n\"But what, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be wantin' to go off to the mountains now, I fear me, boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wantin' _now_!\" exclaimed the youth earnestly; \"I'm _always_ wantin'.\r\nI've bin wantin' ever since I could walk; but I won't go till you let\r\nme, mother, that I won't!\"  And he struck the table with his fist so\r\nforcibly that the platters rung again.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good boy, Dick; but you're too young yit to ventur' among the\r\nRed-skins.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' yit, if I don't ventur' young, I'd better not ventur' at all.  You\r\nknow, mother dear, I don't want to leave you; but I was born to be a\r\nhunter, and everybody in them parts is a hunter, and I can't hunt in the\r\nkitchen you know, mother!\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by a sound that caused\r\nyoung Varley to spring up and seize his rifle, and Fan to show her teeth\r\nand growl.\r\n\r\n\"Hist! mother; that's like horses' hoofs,\" he whispered, opening the\r\ndoor and gazing intently in the direction whence the sound came.\r\n\r\nLouder and louder it came, until an opening in the forest showed the\r\nadvancing cavalcade to be a party of white men.  In another moment they\r\nwere in full view--a band of about thirty horsemen, clad in the leathern\r\ncostume, and armed with the long rifle of the far west.  Some wore\r\nportions of the gaudy Indian dress which gave to them a brilliant,\r\ndashing look.  They came on straight for the block-house, and saluted\r\nthe Varleys with a jovial cheer as they swept past at full speed.  Dick\r\nreturned the cheer with compound interest, and calling out, \"They're\r\ntrappers, mother, I'll be back in an hour,\" bounded off like a deer\r\nthrough the woods, taking a short cut in order to reach the block-house\r\nbefore them.  He succeeded, for, just as he arrived at the house, the\r\ncavalcade wheeled round the bend in the river, dashed up the slope, and\r\ncame to a sudden halt on the green.  Vaulting from their foaming steeds\r\nthey tied them to the stockades of the little fortress, which they\r\nentered in a body.\r\n\r\nHot haste was in every motion of these men.  They were trappers, they\r\nsaid, on their way to the Rocky Mountains to hunt and trade furs.  But\r\none of their number had been treacherously murdered and scalped by a\r\nPawnee chief, and they resolved to revenge his death by an attack on one\r\nof the Pawnee villages.  They would teach these \"red reptiles\" to\r\nrespect white men, they would, come of it what might; and they had\r\nturned aside here to procure an additional supply of powder and lead.\r\n\r\nIn vain did the major endeavour to dissuade these reckless men from\r\ntheir purpose.  They scoffed at the idea of returning good for evil, and\r\ninsisted on being supplied.  The log hut was a store as well as a place\r\nof defence, and as they offered to pay for it there was no refusing\r\ntheir request--at least so the major thought.  The ammunition was\r\ntherefore given to them, and in half an hour they were away again at\r\nfull gallop over the plains on their mission of vengeance.  \"Vengeance\r\nis Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"  But these men knew not what God\r\nsaid, because they never read His Word, and did not own His sway.\r\n\r\nYoung Varley's enthusiasm was considerably damped when he learned the\r\nerrand on which the trappers were bent.  From that time forward he gave\r\nup all desire to visit the mountains in company with such men, but he\r\nstill retained an intense longing to roam at large among their rocky\r\nfastnesses, and gallop out upon the wide prairies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he dutifully tended his mother's cattle and sheep, and\r\ncontented himself with an occasional deer-hunt in the neighbouring\r\nforests.  He devoted himself also to the training of his dog Crusoe--an\r\noperation which at first cost him many a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the sagacity and almost reasoning capabilities of\r\nthe Newfoundland dog.  Indeed, some have even gone the length of saying\r\nthat what is called instinct in these animals is neither more nor less\r\nthan reason.  And, in truth, many of the noble, heroic, and sagacious\r\ndeeds that have actually been performed by Newfoundland dogs incline us\r\nalmost to believe that, like man, they are gifted with reasoning powers.\r\n\r\nBut every one does not know the trouble and patience that is required in\r\norder to get a juvenile dog to understand what its master means when he\r\nis endeavouring to instruct it.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's first lesson was an interesting, but not a very successful one.\r\nWe may remark here that Dick Varley had presented Fan to his mother to\r\nbe her watch-dog, resolving to devote all his powers to the training of\r\nthe pup.  We may also remark, in reference to Crusoe's appearance (and\r\nwe did not remark it sooner, chiefly because up to this period in his\r\neventful history he was little better than a ball of fat and hair), that\r\nhis coat was mingled jet-black and pure white, and remarkably glossy,\r\ncurly, and thick.\r\n\r\nA week after the shooting match Crusoe's education began.  Having fed\r\nhim for that period with his own hand, in order to gain his affection,\r\nDick took him out one sunny forenoon to the margin of the lake to give\r\nhim his first lesson.\r\n\r\nAnd here again we must pause to remark that, although a dog's heart is\r\ngenerally gained in the first instance through his mouth, yet, after it\r\nis thoroughly gained, his affection is noble and disinterested.  He can\r\nscarcely be driven from his master's side by blows, and even when thus\r\nharshly repelled is always ready, on the shortest notice and with the\r\nslightest encouragement, to make it up again.\r\n\r\nWell, Dick Varley began by calling out, \"Crusoe!  Crusoe! come here,\r\npup.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Crusoe knew his name by this time, for it had been so often\r\nused as a prelude to his meals, that he naturally expected a feed\r\nwhenever he heard it.  This portal to his brain had already been open\r\nfor some days; but all the other doors were fast locked, and it required\r\na great deal of careful picking to open them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Crusoe, come here.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe bounded clumsily to his master's side, cocked his ears, and\r\nwagged his tail--so far his education was perfect.  We say he bounded\r\n_clumsily_, for it must be remembered that he was still a very young\r\npup, with soft, flabby muscles.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm goin' to begin yer edication, pup; think o' that.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Crusoe thought of that or not we cannot say, but he looked up in\r\nhis master's face as he spoke, cocked his ears very high, and turned his\r\nhead slowly to one side, until it could not turn any further in that\r\ndirection; then he turned it as much to the other side, whereat his\r\nmaster burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and Crusoe\r\nimmediately began barking vociferously.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said Dick, suddenly checking his mirth, \"we mustn't play,\r\npup, we must work.\"\r\n\r\nDrawing a leathern mitten from his belt, the youth held it to Crusoe's\r\nnose, and then threw it a yard away, at the same time exclaiming in a\r\nloud, distinct tone, \"_Fetch it_.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe entered at once into the spirit of this part of his training; he\r\ndashed gleefully at the mitten, and proceeded to worry it with intense\r\ngratification.  As for \"_Fetch it_,\" he neither understood the words nor\r\ncared a straw about them.\r\n\r\nDick Varley rose immediately, and rescuing the mitten, resumed his seat\r\non a rock.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Crusoe,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! certainly, by all means,\" said Crusoe--no! he didn't exactly _say_\r\nit, but really he _looked_ these words so evidently, that we think it\r\nright to let them stand as they are written.  If he could have finished\r\nthe sentence he would certainly have said, \"Go on with that game over\r\nagain, old boy; it's quite to my taste--the jolliest thing in life, I\r\nassure you!\"  At least, if we may not positively assert that he would\r\nhave said that, no one else can absolutely affirm that he wouldn't.\r\n\r\nWell, Dick Varley did do it over again, and Crusoe worried the mitten\r\nover again--utterly regardless of \"_Fetch it_.\"\r\n\r\nThen they did it again, and again, and again, but without the slightest\r\napparent advancement in the path of canine knowledge,--and then they\r\nwent home.\r\n\r\nDuring all this trying operation Dick Varley never once betrayed the\r\nslightest feeling of irritability or impatience.  He did not expect\r\nsuccess at first; he was not, therefore, disappointed at failure.\r\n\r\nNext day he had him out again--and the next--and the next--and the next\r\nagain, with the like unfavourable result.  In short, it seemed at last\r\nas if Crusoe's mind had been deeply imbued with the idea that he had\r\nbeen born expressly for the purpose of worrying that mitten, and he\r\nmeant to fulfil his destiny to the letter.\r\n\r\nYoung Varley had taken several small pieces of meat in his pocket each\r\nday, with the intention of rewarding Crusoe when he should at length be\r\nprevailed on to fetch the mitten, but as Crusoe was not aware of the\r\ntreat that awaited him, of course the mitten never was \"fetched.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Dick Varley saw that this system would never do, so he changed\r\nhis tactics, and the next morning gave Crusoe no breakfast, but took him\r\nout at the usual hour to go through his lesson.  This new course of\r\nconduct seemed to perplex Crusoe not a little, for on his way down to\r\nthe beach he paused frequently and looked back at the cottage, and then\r\nexpressively up at his master's face.  But the master was inexorable; he\r\nwent on and Crusoe followed, for _true_ love had now taken possession of\r\nthe pup's young heart, and he preferred his master's company to food.\r\n\r\nVarley now began by letting the learner smell a piece of meat which he\r\neagerly sought to devour, but was prevented, to his immense disgust.\r\nThen the mitten was thrown as heretofore, and Crusoe made a few steps\r\ntowards it, but being in no mood for play he turned back.\r\n\r\n\"_Fetch it_,\" said the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" replied the learner mutely, by means of that expressive\r\nsign--_not doing it_.\r\n\r\nHereupon Dick Varley rose, took up the mitten, and put it into the pup's\r\nmouth.  Then, retiring a couple of yards, he held out the piece of meat\r\nand said, \"_Fetch it_.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe instantly spat out the glove and bounded towards the meat--once\r\nmore to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis was done a second time, and Crusoe came forward _with the mitten in\r\nhis mouth_.  It seemed as if it had been done accidentally, for he\r\ndropped it before coming quite up.  If so it was a fortunate accident,\r\nfor it served as the tiny fulcrum on which to place the point of that\r\nmighty lever which was destined ere long to raise him to the pinnacle of\r\ncanine erudition.  Dick Varley immediately lavished upon him the\r\ntenderest caresses and gave him a lump of meat.  But he quickly tried it\r\nagain lest he should lose the lesson.  The dog evidently felt that if he\r\ndid not fetch that mitten he should have no meat or caresses.  In order,\r\nhowever, to make sure that there was no mistake, Dick laid the mitten\r\ndown beside the pup, instead of putting it into his mouth, and, retiring\r\na few paces, cried, \"_Fetch it_.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe looked uncertain for a moment, then he _picked up_ the mitten and\r\nlaid it at his master's feet.  The lesson was learned at last!  Dick\r\nVarley tumbled all the meat out of his pocket on the ground, and, while\r\nCrusoe made a hearty breakfast, he sat down on a rock and whistled with\r\nglee at having fairly picked the lock, and opened _another_ door into\r\none of the many chambers of his dog's intellect!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nOUR HERO ENLARGED UPON--GRUMPS.\r\n\r\nTwo years passed away--the Mustang Valley settlement advanced\r\nprosperously, despite one or two attacks made upon it by the savages,\r\nwho were, however, firmly repelled; Dick Varley had now become a man,\r\nand his pup Crusoe had become a full-grown dog.  The \"silver rifle,\" as\r\nDick's weapon had come to be named, was well-known among the hunters and\r\nthe Red-skins of the border-lands, and in Dick's hands its bullets were\r\nas deadly as its owner's eye was quick and true.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's education, too, had been completed.  Faithfully and patiently\r\nhad his young master trained his mind, until he fitted him to be a meet\r\ncompanion in the hunt.  To \"carry\" and \"fetch\" were now but trifling\r\nportions of the dog's accomplishments.  He could dive a fathom deep in\r\nthe lake and bring up any article that might have been dropped or thrown\r\nin.  His swimming powers were marvellous, and so powerful were his\r\nmuscles, that he seemed to spurn the water while passing through it,\r\nwith his broad chest high out of the curling wave, at a speed that\r\nneither man nor beast could keep up with for a moment.  His intellect\r\nnow was sharp and quick as a needle; he never required a second bidding.\r\nWhen Dick went out hunting he used frequently to drop a mitten or a\r\npowder-horn unknown to the dog, and, after walking miles away from it,\r\nwould stop short and look down into the mild, gentle face of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Crusoe,\" he said, in the same quiet tones with which he would have\r\naddressed a human friend, \"I've dropped my mitten, go fetch it, pup.\"\r\nDick continued to call it \"pup\" from habit.\r\n\r\nOne glance of intelligence passed from Crusoe's eye, and in a moment he\r\nwas away at full gallop; nor did he rest until the lost article was\r\nlying at his master's feet.  Dick was loath to try how far back on his\r\ntrack Crusoe would run if desired.  He had often gone back five and six\r\nmiles at a stretch; but his powers did not stop here.  He could carry\r\narticles back to the spot from which they had been taken and leave them\r\nthere.  He could head the game that his master was pursuing and turn it\r\nback; and he would guard any object he was desired to \"watch\" with\r\nunflinching constancy.  But it would occupy too much space and time to\r\nenumerate all Crusoe's qualities and powers.  His biography will unfold\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance he was majestic, having grown to an immense size\r\neven for a Newfoundland.  Had his visage been at all wolfish in\r\ncharacter, his aspect would have been terrible.  But he possessed in an\r\neminent degree that mild, humble expression of face peculiar to his\r\nrace.  When roused or excited, and especially when bounding through the\r\nforest with the chase in view, he was absolutely magnificent.  At other\r\ntimes his gait was slow, and he seemed to prefer a _quiet_ walk with\r\nDick Varley to anything else under the sun.  But when Dick was inclined\r\nto be boisterous Crusoe's tail and ears rose at a moment's notice, and\r\nhe was ready for _anything_.  Moreover, he obeyed commands instantly and\r\nimplicitly.  In this respect he put to shame most of the _boys_ of the\r\nsettlement, who were by no means famed for their habits of prompt\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's eye was constantly watching the face of his master.  When Dick\r\nsaid \"Go\" he went, when he said \"Come\" he came.  If he had been in the\r\nmidst of an excited bound at the throat of a stag, and Dick had called\r\nout, \"Down, Crusoe,\" he would have sunk to the earth like a stone.  No\r\ndoubt it took many months of training to bring the dog to this state of\r\nperfection; but Dick accomplished it by patience, perseverance, and\r\n_love_.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, Crusoe could speak!  He spoke by means of the dog's\r\ndumb alphabet in a way that defies description.  He conversed, so to\r\nspeak, with his extremities--his head and his tail.  But his eyes, his\r\nsoft brown eyes, were the chief medium of communication.  If ever the\r\nlanguage of the eyes was carried to perfection, it was exhibited in the\r\nperson of Crusoe.  But, indeed, it would be difficult to say which part\r\nof his expressive face expressed most.  The cocked ears of expectation;\r\nthe drooped ears of sorrow; the bright, full eye of joy; the half-closed\r\neye of contentment; and the frowning eye of indignation accompanied with\r\na slight, a very slight, pucker of the nose and a gleam of dazzling\r\nivory--ha! no enemy ever saw this last piece of canine language without\r\na full appreciation of what it meant.  Then as to the tail--the\r\nmodulations of meaning in the varied wag of that expressive member!  Oh!\r\nit's useless to attempt description.  Mortal man cannot conceive of the\r\ndelicate shades of sentiment expressible by a dog's tail, unless he has\r\nstudied the subject--the wag, the waggle, the cock, the droop, the\r\nslope, the wriggle!  Away with description--it is impotent and valueless\r\nhere!\r\n\r\nAs we have said, Crusoe was meek and mild.  He had been bitten, on the\r\nsly, by half the ill-natured curs in the settlement, and had only shown\r\nhis teeth in return.  He had no enmities--though several enemies--and he\r\nhad a thousand friends, particularly among the ranks of the weak and the\r\npersecuted, whom he always protected and avenged when opportunity\r\noffered.  A single instance of this kind will serve to show his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOne day Dick and Crusoe were sitting on a rock beside the lake--the same\r\nidentical rock near which, when a pup, the latter had received his first\r\nlesson.  They were conversing as usual, for Dick had elicited such a\r\nfund of intelligence from the dog's mind, and had injected such wealth\r\nof wisdom into it, that he felt convinced it understood every word he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"This is capital weather, Crusoe; ain't it pup?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe made a motion with his head which was quite as significant as a\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! my pup, I wish that you and I might go and have a slap at the\r\ngrizzly bars and a look at the Rocky Mountains.  Wouldn't it be nuts,\r\npup?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe looked dubious.\r\n\r\n\"What, you don't agree with me!  Now, tell me, pup, wouldn't ye like to\r\ngrip a bar?\"\r\n\r\nStill Crusoe looked dubious, but made a gentle motion with his tail, as\r\nthough he would have said, \"I've seen neither Rocky Mountains nor\r\ngrizzly bars, and know nothin' about 'em, but I'm open to conviction.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a brave pup,\" rejoined Dick, stroking the dog's huge head\r\naffectionately.  \"I wouldn't give you for ten times your weight in\r\ngolden dollars--if there be sich things.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe made no reply whatever to this.  He regarded it as a truism\r\nunworthy of notice; he evidently felt that a comparison between love and\r\ndollars was preposterous.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the conversation a little dog with a lame leg hobbled\r\nto the edge of the rocks in front of the spot where Dick was seated, and\r\nlooked down into the water, which was deep there.  Whether it did so for\r\nthe purpose of admiring its very plain visage in the liquid mirror, or\r\nfinding out what was going on among the fish, we cannot say, as it never\r\ntold us; but at that moment a big, clumsy, savage-looking dog rushed out\r\nfrom the neighbouring thicket and began to worry it.\r\n\r\n\"Punish him, Crusoe,\" said Dick quickly.\r\n\r\nCrusoe made one bound that a lion might have been proud of, and seizing\r\nthe aggressor by the back, lifted him off his legs and held him,\r\nhowling, in the air--at the same time casting a look towards his master\r\nfor further instructions.\r\n\r\n\"Pitch him in,\" said Dick, making a sign with his hand.\r\n\r\nCrusoe turned and quietly dropped the dog into the lake.  Having\r\nregarded his struggles there for a few moments with grave severity of\r\ncountenance, he walked slowly back and sat down beside his master.\r\n\r\nThe little dog made good its retreat as fast as three legs would carry\r\nit, and the surly dog, having swam ashore, retired sulkily, with his\r\ntail very much between his legs.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder, then, that Crusoe was beloved by great and small among\r\nthe well-disposed of the canine tribes of the Mustang Valley.\r\n\r\nBut Crusoe was not a mere machine.  When not actively engaged in Dick\r\nVarley's service, he busied himself with private little matters of his\r\nown.  He undertook modest little excursions into the woods or along the\r\nmargin of the lake, sometimes alone, but more frequently with a little\r\nfriend whose whole heart and being seemed to be swallowed up in\r\nadmiration of his big companion.  Whether Crusoe botanised or geologised\r\non these excursions we will not venture to say.  Assuredly he seemed as\r\nthough he did both, for he poked his nose into every bush and tuft of\r\nmoss, and turned over the stones, and dug holes in the ground--and, in\r\nshort, if he did not understand these sciences, he behaved very much as\r\nif he did.  Certainly he knew as much about them as many of the human\r\nspecies do.\r\n\r\nIn these walks he never took the slightest notice of Grumps (that was\r\nthe little dog's name), but Grumps made up for this by taking excessive\r\nnotice of _him_.  When Crusoe stopped, Grumps stopped and sat down to\r\nlook at him.  When Crusoe trotted on, Grumps trotted on too.  When\r\nCrusoe examined a bush Grumps sat down to watch him, and when he dug a\r\nhole Grumps looked into it to see what was there.  Grumps never helped\r\nhim; his sole delight was in looking on.  They didn't converse much,\r\nthese two dogs.  To be in each other's company seemed to be happiness\r\nenough--at least Grumps thought so.\r\n\r\nThere was one point at which Grumps stopped short, however, and ceased\r\nto follow his friend; and that was when he rushed headlong into the lake\r\nand disported himself for an hour at a time in its cool waters.  Crusoe\r\nwas, both by nature and training, a splendid water-dog.  Grumps, on the\r\ncontrary, held water in abhorrence, so he sat on the shores of the lake\r\ndisconsolate when his friend was bathing, and waited till he came out.\r\nThe only time when Grumps was thoroughly nonplussed, was when Dick\r\nVarley's whistle sounded faintly in the far distance.  Then Crusoe would\r\nprick up his ears, and stretch out at full gallop, clearing ditch, and\r\nfence, and brake with his strong elastic bound, and leaving Grumps to\r\npatter after him as fast as his four-inch legs would carry him.  Poor\r\nGrumps usually arrived at the village, to find both dog and master gone,\r\nand would betake himself to his own dwelling, there to lie down and\r\nsleep, and dream, perchance, of rambles and gambols with his gigantic\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nA MISSION OF PEACE--UNEXPECTED JOYS--DICK AND CRUSOE SET OFF FOR THE\r\nLAND OF THE RED-SKINS, AND MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY AS A MATTER\r\nOF COURSE--NIGHT IN THE WILD WOODS.\r\n\r\nOne day the inhabitants of Mustang Valley were thrown into considerable\r\nexcitement by the arrival of an officer of the United States army and a\r\nsmall escort of cavalry.  They went direct to the block-house, which,\r\nsince Major Hope's departure, had become the residence of Joe Blunt--\r\nthat worthy having, by general consent, been deemed the fittest man in\r\nthe settlement to fill the major's place.\r\n\r\nSoon it began to be noised abroad that the strangers had been sent by\r\nGovernment to endeavour to bring about, if possible, a more friendly\r\nstate of feeling between the whites and the Indians, by means of\r\npresents, and promises, and fair speeches.\r\n\r\nThe party remained all night in the block-house, and ere long it was\r\nreported that Joe Blunt had been requested, and had consented, to be the\r\nleader and chief of a party of three men who should visit the\r\nneighbouring tribes of Indians, to the west and north of the valley, as\r\nGovernment agents.  Joe's knowledge of two or three different Indian\r\ndialects, and his well-known sagacity, rendered him a most fitting\r\nmessenger on such an errand.  It was also whispered that Joe was to have\r\nthe choosing of his comrades in this mission, and many were the opinions\r\nexpressed and guesses made as to who would be chosen.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Dick Varley was sitting in his mother's kitchen\r\ncleaning his rifle; his mother was preparing supper and talking quietly\r\nabout the obstinacy of a particular hen that had taken to laying her\r\neggs in places where they could not be found; Fan was coiled up in a\r\ncorner sound asleep, and Crusoe was sitting at one side of the fire\r\nlooking on at things in general.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" remarked Mrs Varley, as she spread the table with a pure\r\nwhite napkin; \"I wonder what the sodgers are doin' wi' Joe Blunt.\"\r\n\r\nAs often happens when an individual is mentioned, the worthy referred to\r\nopened the door at that moment and stepped into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Good-e'en t'ye, dame,\" said the stout hunter, doffing his cap, and\r\nresting his rifle in a corner, while Dick rose and placed a chair for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The same to you, Master Blunt,\" answered the widow; \"you've jist comed\r\nin good time for a cut o' venison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, mistress, I s'pose we're beholden to the silver rifle for\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the hand that aimed it, rather,\" suggested the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, then, say raither to the dog that turned it,\" said Dick Varley.\r\n\"But for Crusoe that buck would ha' bin couched in the woods this\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if it comes to that,\" retorted Joe, \"I'd lay it to the door o' Fan,\r\nfor if she'd niver bin born nother would Crusoe.  But it's good an'\r\ntender meat, whativer ways ye got it.  Howsiver, I've other things to\r\ntalk about jist now.  Them sodgers that are eatin' buffalo tongues up at\r\nthe block-house as if they'd niver ate meat before, and didn't hope to\r\neat agin for a twelve-month--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, what o' them?\" interrupted Mrs Varley; \"I've bin wonderin' what\r\nwas their errand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of coorse ye wos, Dame Varley; and I've comed here a' purpis to tell\r\nye.  They want me to go to the Red-skins to make peace between them and\r\nus; and they've brought a lot o' goods to make them presents withal,--\r\nbeads, an' knives, an' lookin'-glasses, an vermilion paint, an'\r\nsich-like, jist as much as'll be a light load for one horse--for, ye\r\nsee, nothin' can be done wi' the Red-skins without gifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a blessed mission,\" said the widow, \"I wish it may succeed.  D'ye\r\nthink ye'll go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go? ay, that will I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish they'd made the offer to me,\" said Dick with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"An' so they do make the offer, lad.  They've gin me leave to choose the\r\ntwo men I'm to take with me, and I've comed straight to ask _you_.  Ay\r\nor no, for we must up an' away by break o' day to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Varley started.  \"So soon?\" she said, with a look of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Ay; the Pawnees are at the Yellow Creek jist at this time, but I've\r\nheer'd they're 'bout to break up camp an' away west; so we'll need to\r\nuse haste.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I go, mother?\" asked Dick, with a look of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a conflict in the widow's breast, but it quickly\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my boy,\" she said in her own low, quiet voice, \"an' God go with\r\nye.  I knew the time must come soon, an' I thank Him that your first\r\nvisit to the Red-skins will be on an errand o' peace.  `Blessed are the\r\npeacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'\"\r\n\r\nDick grasped his mother's hand and pressed it to his cheek in silence.\r\nAt the same moment Crusoe, seeing that the deeper feelings of his master\r\nwere touched, and deeming it his duty to sympathise, rose up and thrust\r\nhis nose against him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! pup,\" cried the young man hastily, \"you must go too.  Of course\r\nCrusoe goes, Joe Blunt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!  I don't know that.  There's no dependin' on a dog to keep his\r\ntongue quiet in times o' danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe me,\" exclaimed Dick, flashing with enthusiasm, \"Crusoe's more\r\ntrustworthy than I am myself.  If ye can trust the master yer safe to\r\ntrust the pup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, lad, ye may be right.  We'll take him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Joe.  And who else goes with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've bin castin' that in my mind for some time, an' I've fixed to take\r\nHenri.  He's not the safest man in the valley, but he's the truest,\r\nthat's a fact.  And now, younker, get yer horse an' rifle ready, and\r\ncome to the block-house at daybreak to-morrow.  Good luck to ye,\r\nmistress, till we meet agin.\"\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt rose, and taking up his rifle,--without which he scarcely ever\r\nmoved a foot from his own door,--left the cottage with rapid strides.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said Mrs Varley, kissing Dick's cheek as he resumed his seat,\r\n\"put this in the little pocket I made for it in your hunting shirt.\"\r\n\r\nShe handed him a small pocket Bible.\r\n\r\n\"Dear mother,\" he said, as he placed the book carefully within the\r\nbreast of his coat, \"the Red-skin that takes that from me must take my\r\nscalp first.  But don't fear for me.  You've often said the Lord would\r\nprotect me.  So He will, mother, for sure it's an errand o' peace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's it, that's it,\" murmured the widow in a half-soliloquy.\r\n\r\nDick Varley spent that night in converse with his mother, and next\r\nmorning at daybreak he was at the place of meeting mounted on his sturdy\r\nlittle horse, with the \"silver rifle\" on his shoulder, and Crusoe by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, lad, that's right.  Nothin' like keepin' yer time,\" said\r\nJoe, as he led out a pack-horse from the gate of the block-house, while\r\nhis own charger was held ready saddled by a man named Daniel Brand, who\r\nhad been appointed to the charge of the block-house in his absence.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Henri?--oh! here he comes,\" exclaimed Dick, as the hunter\r\nreferred to came thundering up the slope at a charge, on a horse that\r\nresembled its rider in size, and not a little in clumsiness of\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! mes boy.  Him is a goot one to go,\" cried Henri, remarking Dick's\r\nsmile as he pulled up.  \"No hoss on de plain can beat dis one,\r\nsurement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Henri, lend a hand to fix this pack, we've no time to\r\npalaver.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they were joined by several of the soldiers and a few\r\nhunters who had come to see them start.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, Joe,\" cried one, \"if you don't come back in three months\r\nwe'll all come out in a band to seek you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we don't come back in less than that time, what's left o' us won't\r\nbe worth seekin' for,\" said Joe, tightening the girth of his saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Put a bit in yer own mouth, Henri,\" cried another, as the Canadian\r\narranged his steed's bridle; \"ye'll need it more than yer horse when ye\r\ngit 'mong the red reptiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vraiment, if mon mout' needs one bit yours will need one padlock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, mount!\" cried Joe Blunt as he vaulted into the saddle.\r\n\r\nDick Varley sprang lightly on his horse, and Henri made a rush at his\r\nsteed and hurled his huge frame across its back with a violence that\r\n_ought_ to have brought it to the ground; but the tall, raw-boned,\r\nbroad-chested roan was accustomed to the eccentricities of its master,\r\nand stood the shock bravely.  Being appointed to lead the pack-horse,\r\nHenri seized its halter; then the three cavaliers shook their reins,\r\nand, waving their hands to their comrades, they sprang into the woods at\r\nfull gallop, and laid their course for the \"far west.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time they galloped side by side in silence, each occupied with\r\nhis own thoughts, Crusoe keeping close beside his master's horse.  The\r\ntwo elder hunters evidently ruminated on the object of their mission and\r\nthe prospects of success, for their countenances were grave and their\r\neyes cast on the ground.  Dick Varley, too, thought upon the Red-men,\r\nbut his musings were deeply tinged with the bright hues of a _first_\r\nadventure.  The mountains, the plains, the Indians, the bears, the\r\nbuffaloes, and a thousand other objects, danced wildly before his mind's\r\neye, and his blood careered through his veins and flushed his forehead\r\nas he thought of what he should see and do, and felt the elastic vigour\r\nof youth respond in sympathy to the light spring of his active little\r\nsteed.  He was a lover of nature, too, and his flashing eyes glanced\r\nobservantly from side to side as they swept along,--sometimes through\r\nglades of forest trees; sometimes through belts of more open ground and\r\nshrubbery; anon by the margin of a stream, or along the shores of a\r\nlittle lake, and often over short stretches of flowering prairie-land,--\r\nwhile the firm, elastic turf sent up a muffled sound from the tramp of\r\ntheir mettlesome chargers.  It was a scene of wild, luxuriant beauty,\r\nthat might almost (one could fancy) have drawn involuntary homage to its\r\nbountiful Creator from the lips even of an infidel.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Joe Blunt reined up, and they proceeded at an easy ambling\r\npace.  Joe and his friend Henri were so used to these beautiful scenes\r\nthat they had long ceased to be _enthusiastically_ affected by them,\r\nthough they never ceased to delight in them.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Joe, \"that them sodgers 'll go their ways soon.  I've no\r\nnotion o' them chaps when they're left at a place wi' nothin' to do but\r\nwhittle sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Joe!\" exclaimed Dick Varley in a tone of surprise, \"I thought you\r\nwere admirin' the beautiful face o' nature all this time, and yer only\r\nthinkin' about the sodgers.  Now, that's strange!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so strange after all, lad,\" answered Joe.  \"When a man's used to a\r\nthing he gits to admire an' enjoy it without speakin' much about it.\r\nBut it _is_ true, boy, that mankind gits in coorse o' time to think\r\nlittle o' the blissins he's used to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, c'est _vrai_!\" murmured Henri emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Joe Blunt, it may be so; but I'm thankful _I'm_ not used to this\r\nsort o' thing yet,\" exclaimed Varley.  \"Let's have another gallop--so\r\nho! come along, Crusoe!\" shouted the youth, as he shook his reins, and\r\nflew over a long stretch of prairie on which at that moment they\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nJoe smiled as he followed his enthusiastic companion, but after a short\r\nrun he pulled up.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, youngster,\" he cried, \"ye must larn to do as yer bid, lad;\r\nit's trouble enough to be among wild Injuns and wild buffaloes, as I\r\nhope soon to be, without havin' wild comrades to look after.\"\r\n\r\nDick laughed and reined in his panting horse.  \"I'll be as obedient as\r\nCrusoe,\" he said, \"and no one can beat him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" continued Joe, \"the horses won't travel far if we begin by\r\nrunnin' all the wind out o' them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wah!\" exclaimed Henri, as the led horse became restive; \"I think we\r\nmust give to him de pack-hoss for to lead, eh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bad notion, Henri.  We'll make that the penalty of runnin' off\r\nagain; so look out, Master Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm down,\" replied Dick with a modest air, \"obedient as a baby, and\r\nwon't run off again--till--the next time.  By the way, Joe, how many\r\ndays' provisions did ye bring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two.  That's 'nough to carry us to the Great Prairie, which is three\r\nweeks distant from this; our own good rifles must make up the\r\ndifference, and keep us when we git there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And s'pose we neither find deer nor buffalo,\" suggested Dick.\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose we'll have to starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat is cumfer'able to tink upon,\" remarked Henri.\r\n\r\n\"More comfortable to think o' than to undergo,\" said Dick, \"but I s'pose\r\nthere's little chance o' that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not much,\" replied Joe Blunt, patting his horse's neck; \"but d'ye\r\nsee, lad, ye niver can count for sartin on anythin'.  The deer and\r\nbuffalo ought to be thick in them plains at this time--and when the\r\nbuffalo _are_ thick they covers the plains till ye can hardly see the\r\nend o' them; but, ye see, sometimes the rascally Red-skins takes it into\r\ntheir heads to burn the prairies, and sometimes ye find the place that\r\nshould ha' bin black wi' buffalo, black as a coal wi' fire for miles an'\r\nmiles on end.  At other times the Red-skins go huntin' in 'ticlar\r\nplaces, and sweeps them clean o' every hoof that don't git away.\r\nSometimes, too, the animals seems to take a scunner at a place and keeps\r\nout o' the way.  But one way or another men gin'rally manage to scramble\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder, Joe,\" exclaimed Dick, pointing to the summit of a distant\r\nridge, where a small black object was seen moving against the sky,\r\n\"that's a deer, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nJoe shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed earnestly at the object in\r\nquestion.  \"Yer right, boy; and by good luck we've got the wind of him.\r\nCut in an' take your chance now.  There's a long strip o' wood as'll let\r\nye git close to him.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the sentence was well finished, Dick and Crusoe were off at full\r\ngallop.  For a few hundred yards they coursed along the bottom of a\r\nhollow; then turning to the right they entered the strip of wood, and in\r\na few minutes gained the edge of it.  Here Dick dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"You can't help me here, Crusoe.  Stay where you are, pup, and hold my\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe seized the end of the line, which was fastened to the horse's\r\nnose, in his mouth, and lay down on a hillock of moss, submissively\r\nplacing his chin on his fore-paws, and watching his master as he stepped\r\nnoiselessly through the wood.  In a few minutes Dick emerged from among\r\nthe trees, and, creeping from bush to bush, succeeded in getting to\r\nwithin six hundred yards of the deer, which was a beautiful little\r\nantelope.  Beyond the bush behind which he now crouched all was bare\r\nopen ground, without a shrub or hillock large enough to conceal the\r\nhunter.  There was a slight undulation in the ground, however, which\r\nenabled him to advance about fifty yards further, by means of lying down\r\nquite flat and working himself forward like a serpent.  Further than\r\nthis he could not move without being seen by the antelope, which browsed\r\non the ridge before him in fancied security.  The distance was too great\r\neven for a long shot, but Dick knew of a weak point in this little\r\ncreature's nature which enabled him to accomplish his purpose--a weak\r\npoint which it shares in common with animals of a higher order,--namely,\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThe little antelope of the North American prairies is intensely curious\r\nabout everything that it does not quite understand, and will not rest\r\nsatisfied until it has endeavoured to clear up the mystery.  Availing\r\nhimself of this propensity, Dick did what both Indians and hunters are\r\naccustomed to do on these occasions,--he put a piece of rag on the end\r\nof his ramrod, and, keeping his person concealed and perfectly still,\r\nwaved this miniature flag in the air.  The antelope noticed it at once,\r\nand, pricking up its ears, began to advance, timidly and slowly, step by\r\nstep, to see what remarkable phenomenon it could be.  In a few seconds\r\nthe flag was lowered, a sharp crack followed, and the antelope fell dead\r\nupon the plain.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, boy! that's a good supper, anyhow,\" cried Joe, as he galloped up\r\nand dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"Goot! dat is better nor dried meat,\" added Henri.  \"Give him to me; I\r\nwill put him on my hoss, vich is strongar dan yourn.  But ver is your\r\nhoss?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be here in a minute,\" replied Dick, putting his fingers to his\r\nmouth and giving forth a shrill whistle.\r\n\r\nThe instant Crusoe heard the sound he made a savage and apparently\r\nuncalled-for dash at the horse's heels.  This wild act, so contrary to\r\nthe dog's gentle nature, was a mere piece of acting.  He knew that the\r\nhorse would not advance without getting a fright, so he gave him one in\r\nthis way which sent him off at a gallop.  Crusoe followed close at his\r\nheels, so as to bring the line alongside of the nag's body, and thereby\r\nprevent its getting entangled; but despite his best efforts the horse\r\ngot on one side of a tree and he on the other, so he wisely let go his\r\nhold of the line, and waited till more open ground enabled him to catch\r\nit again.  Then he hung heavily back, gradually checked the horse's\r\nspeed, and finally trotted him up to his master's side.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a cliver cur, good sooth,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Joe! you haven't seen much of Crusoe yet.  He's as good as a man\r\nany day.  I've done little else but train him for two years gone by, and\r\nhe can do most anything but shoot--he can't handle the rifle nohow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! then, I tink perhaps hims could if he wos try,\" said Henri,\r\nplunging on to his horse with a laugh, and arranging the carcase of the\r\nantelope across the pommel of his saddle.\r\n\r\nThus they hunted and galloped, and trotted and ambled on through wood\r\nand plain all day, until the sun began to descend below the tree-tops of\r\nthe bluffs on the west--then Joe Blunt looked about him for a place on\r\nwhich to camp, and finally fixed on a spot under the shadow of a noble\r\nbirch by the margin of a little stream.  The carpet of grass on its\r\nbanks was soft like green velvet, and the rippling waters of the brook\r\nwere clear as crystal--very different from the muddy Missouri into which\r\nit flowed.\r\n\r\nWhile Dick Varley felled and cut up firewood, Henri unpacked the horses\r\nand turned them loose to graze, and Joe kindled the fire and prepared\r\nvenison steaks and hot tea for supper.\r\n\r\nIn excursions of this kind it is customary to \"hobble\" the horses; that\r\nis, to tie their fore-legs together, so that they cannot run either fast\r\nor far, but are free enough to amble about with a clumsy sort of hop in\r\nsearch of food.  This is deemed a sufficient check on their tendency to\r\nroam, although some of the knowing horses sometimes learn to hop so fast\r\nwith their hobbles as to give their owners much trouble to recapture\r\nthem.  But when out in the prairies where Indians are known or supposed\r\nto be in the neighbourhood, the horses are picketed by means of a pin or\r\nstake attached to the ends of their long laryats, as well as hobbled--\r\nfor Indians deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lies, though they think\r\nit disgraceful to be found out in doing either.  And so expert are these\r\ndark-skinned natives of the western prairies, that they will creep into\r\nthe midst of an enemy's camp, cut the laryats and hobbles of several\r\nhorses, spring suddenly on their backs, and gallop away.\r\n\r\nThey not only steal from white men, but tribes that are at enmity steal\r\nfrom each other, and the boldness with which they do this is most\r\nremarkable.  When Indians are travelling in a country where enemies are\r\nprowling, they guard their camps at night with jealous care.  The horses\r\nin particular are both hobbled and picketed, and sentries are posted all\r\nround the camp.  Yet, in spite of these precautions, hostile Indians\r\nmanage to elude the sentries, and creep into the camp.  When a thief\r\nthus succeeds in effecting an entrance, his chief danger is past.  He\r\nrises boldly to his feet, and, wrapping his blanket or buffalo robe\r\nround him, he walks up and down as if he were a member of the tribe.  At\r\nthe same time he dexterously cuts the laryats of such horses as he\r\nobserves are not hobbled.  He dare not stoop to cut the hobbles, as the\r\naction would be observed, and suspicion would be instantly aroused.  He\r\nthen leaps on the best horse he can find, and uttering a terrific\r\nwar-whoop darts away into the plains, driving the loosened horses before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNo such dark thieves were supposed to be near the camp under the\r\nbirch-tree, however, so Joe, and Dick, and Henri ate their supper in\r\ncomfort, and let their horses browse at will on the rich pasturage.\r\n\r\nA bright ruddy fire was soon kindled, which created, as it were, a\r\nlittle ball of light in the midst of surrounding darkness for the\r\nspecial use of our hardy hunters.  Within this magic circle all was\r\nwarm, comfortable, and cheery.  Outside all was dark, and cold, and\r\ndreary by contrast.\r\n\r\nWhen the substantial part of supper was disposed of, tea and pipes were\r\nintroduced, and conversation began to flow.  Then the three saddles were\r\nplaced in a row; each hunter wrapped himself in his blanket, and,\r\npillowing his head on his saddle, stretched his feet towards the fire\r\nand went to sleep, with his loaded rifle by his side and his\r\nhunting-knife handy in his belt.  Crusoe mounted guard by stretching\r\nhimself out _couchant_ at Dick Varley's side.  The faithful dog slept\r\nlightly and never moved all night, but had any one observed him closely\r\nhe would have seen that every fitful flame that burst from the sinking\r\nfire, every unusual puff of wind, and every motion of the horses that\r\nfed or rested hard by, had the effect of revealing a speck of glittering\r\nwhite in Crusoe's watchful eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PRAIRIES OF THE \"FAR WEST\"--A REMARKABLE COLONY DISCOVERED,\r\nAND A MISERABLE NIGHT ENDURED.\r\n\r\nOf all the hours of the night or day the hour that succeeds the dawn is\r\nthe purest, the most joyous and the best.  At least so think we; and so\r\nthink hundreds and thousands of the human family; and so thought Dick\r\nVarley, as he sprung suddenly into a sitting posture next morning, and\r\nthrew his arms with an exulting feeling of delight round the neck of\r\nCrusoe, who instantly sat up to greet him.\r\n\r\nThis was an unusual piece of enthusiasm on the part of Dick, but the dog\r\nreceived it with marked satisfaction, rubbed his big hairy cheek against\r\nthat of his young master, and arose from his sedentary position in order\r\nto afford free scope for the use of his tail.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Joe Blunt!  Henri!  Up, boys, up!  The sun will have the start o'\r\nus.  I'll catch the nags.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying Dick bounded away into the woods with Crusoe gambolling\r\njoyously at his heels.  Dick soon caught his own horse and Crusoe caught\r\nJoe's.  Then the former mounted and quickly brought in the other two.\r\n\r\nReturning to the camp he found everything packed and ready to strap on\r\nthe back of the pack-horse.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to do it, lad,\" cried Joe.  \"Here Henri, look alive and\r\ngit yer beast ready.  I do believe yer goin' to take another snooze!\"\r\n\r\nHenri was indeed, at that moment, indulging in a gigantic stretch and a\r\ncavernous yawn, but he finished both hastily, and rushed at his poor\r\nhorse as if he intended to slay it on the spot.  He only threw the\r\nsaddle on its back, however, and then threw himself on the saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, all ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,--oui, yis!\"\r\n\r\nAnd away they went at full stretch again on their journey.\r\n\r\nThus day after day they travelled, and night after night they laid them\r\ndown to sleep under the trees of the forest, until at length they\r\nreached the edge of the Great Prairie.\r\n\r\nIt was a great, a memorable day in the life of Dick Varley, that on\r\nwhich he first beheld the prairie,--the vast boundless prairie.  He had\r\nheard of it, talked of it, dreamed about it, but he had never,--no, he\r\nhad never realised it.  'Tis always thus.  Our conceptions of things\r\nthat we have not seen are almost invariably wrong.  Dick's eyes\r\nglittered, and his heart swelled, and his cheeks flushed, and his breath\r\ncame thick and quick.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" he gasped, as the great rolling plain broke suddenly on\r\nhis enraptured gaze; \"that's it--oh!--\"\r\n\r\nDick uttered a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest chief of\r\nthe Pawnees, and, being unable to utter another word, he swung his cap\r\nin the air and sprang like an arrow from a bow over the mighty ocean of\r\ngrass.  The sun had just risen to send a flood of golden glory over the\r\nscene; the horses were fresh, so the elder hunters, gladdened by the\r\nbeauty of all around them, and inspired by the irresistible enthusiasm\r\nof their young companion, gave the reins to the horses and flew after\r\nhim.  It was a glorious gallop, that first headlong dash over the\r\nboundless prairie of the \"far west!\"\r\n\r\nThe prairies have often been compared, most justly, to the ocean.  There\r\nis the same wide circle of space bounded on all sides by the horizon;\r\nthere is the same swell, or undulation, or succession of long low\r\nunbroken waves that marks the ocean when it is calm; they are canopied\r\nby the same pure sky, and swept by the same untrammelled breezes.  There\r\nare islands, too--clumps of trees and willow-bushes,--which rise out of\r\nthis grassy ocean to break and relieve its uniformity; and these vary in\r\nsize and numbers as do the isles of ocean--being numerous in some\r\nplaces, while in others they are so scarce that the traveller does not\r\nmeet one in a long day's journey.  Thousands of beautiful flowers decked\r\nthe green sward, and numbers of little birds hopped about among them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Joe Blunt, reining up, \"our troubles begin to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our troubles! our joys, you mean!\" exclaimed Dick Varley.\r\n\r\n\"P'raps I don't mean nothin' o' the sort,\" retorted Joe.  \"Man wos never\r\nintended to swaller his joys without a strong mixtur' o' troubles.  I\r\ns'pose he couldn't stand 'em pure.  Ye see we've got to the prairie\r\nnow--\"\r\n\r\n\"One blind hoss might see dat!\" interrupted Henri.\r\n\r\n\"An' we may or may not diskiver buffalo.  An' water's scarce, too, so\r\nwe'll need to look out for it pretty sharp, I guess, else we'll lose our\r\nhorses, in which case we may as well give out at once.  Besides, there's\r\nrattlesnakes about in sandy places--we'll ha' to look out for them; an'\r\nthere's badger holes--we'll need to look sharp for them lest the horses\r\nput their feet in 'em; an' there's Injuns, who'll look out pretty sharp\r\nfor _us_ if they once get wind that we're in them parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, yis, mes boys, and there's rain, and tunder, and lightin',\" added\r\nHenri, pointing to a dark cloud which was seen rising on the horizon\r\nahead of them.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be rain,\" remarked Joe, \"but there's no thunder in the air jist\r\nnow; we'll make for yonder clump o' bushes and lay by till it's past.\"\r\n\r\nTurning a little to the right of the course they had been following, the\r\nhunters galloped along one of the hollows between the prairie waves\r\nbefore mentioned, in the direction of a clump of willows.  Before\r\nreaching it however, they passed over a bleak and barren plain where\r\nthere was neither flower nor bird.  Here they were suddenly arrested by\r\na most extraordinary sight--at least it was so to Dick Varley, who had\r\nnever seen the like before.  This was a colony of what Joe called\r\n\"prairie-dogs.\"  On first beholding them Crusoe uttered a sort of half\r\ngrowl, half bark of surprise, cocked his tail and ears, and instantly\r\nprepared to charge, but he glanced up at his master first for\r\npermission.  Observing that his finger and his look commanded \"silence\"\r\nhe dropped his tail at once and stepped to the rear.  He did not,\r\nhowever, cease to regard the prairie-dogs with intense curiosity.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable little creatures have been egregiously misnamed by the\r\nhunters of the west, for they bear not the slightest resemblance to\r\ndogs, either in formation or habits.  They are, in fact, the marmot, and\r\nin size are little larger than squirrels, which animals they resemble in\r\nsome degree.  They burrow under the light soil and throw it up in mounds\r\nlike moles.\r\n\r\nThousands of them were running about among their dwellings when Dick\r\nfirst beheld them, but the moment they caught sight of the horsemen\r\nrising over the ridge, they set up a tremendous hubbub of consternation;\r\neach little beast instantly mounted guard on the top of his house and\r\nprepared, as it were, to \"receive cavalry.\"\r\n\r\nThe most ludicrous thing about them was, that although the most timid\r\nand cowardly creatures in the world, they seemed the most impertinent\r\nthings that ever lived!  Knowing that their holes afforded them a\r\nperfectly safe retreat they sat close beside them, and as the hunters\r\nslowly approached, they elevated their heads, wagged their little tails,\r\nshowed their teeth, and chattered at them like monkeys.  The nearer they\r\ncame the more angry and furious did the prairie-dogs become, until Dick\r\nVarley almost fell off his horse with suppressed laughter.  They let the\r\nhunters come close up, waxing louder and louder in their wrath; but the\r\ninstant a hand was raised to throw a stone or point a gun, a thousand\r\nlittle heads dived into a thousand holes, and a thousand little tails\r\nwriggled for an instant in the air--then, a dead silence reigned over\r\nthe deserted scene.\r\n\r\n\"Bien, them's have dive into de bo'-els of de eart',\" said Henri with a\r\nbroad grin.\r\n\r\nPresently a thousand noses appeared, and nervously disappeared like the\r\nwink of an eye.  Then they appeared again, and a thousand pairs of eyes\r\nfollowed.  Instantly, like Jack in the box, they were all on the top of\r\ntheir hillocks again, chattering and wagging their little tails as\r\nvigorously as ever.  You could not say that you _saw_ them jump out of\r\ntheir holes.  Suddenly, as if by magic, they _were_ out; then Dick\r\ntossed up his arms, and, suddenly, as if by magic, they were gone!\r\n\r\nTheir number was incredible, and their cities were full of riotous\r\nactivity.  What their occupations were the hunters could not ascertain,\r\nbut it was perfectly evident that they visited a great deal and gossiped\r\ntremendously, for they ran about from house to house, and sat chatting\r\nin groups; but it was also observed that they never went far from their\r\nown houses.  Each seemed to have a circle of acquaintance in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of his own residence, to which in case of sudden\r\ndanger he always fled.\r\n\r\nBut another thing about these prairie-dogs (perhaps, considering their\r\nsize, we should call them prairie-doggies), another thing about them, we\r\nsay, was that each doggie lived with an owl, or, more correctly, an owl\r\nlived with each doggie!  This is such an extraordinary _fact_, that we\r\ncould scarce hope that men would believe us, were our statement not\r\nsupported by dozens of trustworthy travellers who have visited and\r\nwritten about these regions.  The whole plain was covered with these\r\nowls.  Each hole seemed to be the residence of an owl and a doggie, and\r\nthese incongruous couples lived together apparently in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nWe have not been able to ascertain from travellers _why_ the owls have\r\ngone to live with these doggies, so we beg humbly to offer our own\r\nprivate opinion to the reader.  We assume, then, that owls find it\r\nabsolutely needful to have holes.  Probably prairie-owls cannot dig\r\nholes for themselves.  Having discovered, however, a race of little\r\ncreatures that could, they very likely determined to take forcible\r\npossession of the holes made by them.  Finding, no doubt, that, when\r\nthey did so, the doggies were too timid to object, and discovering,\r\nmoreover, that they were sweet, innocent little creatures, the owls\r\nresolved to take them into partnership, and so the thing was settled--\r\nthat's how it came about, no doubt of it!\r\n\r\nThere is a report that rattlesnakes live in these holes also; but we\r\ncannot certify our reader of the truth of this,--still it is well to be\r\nacquainted with a report that is current among the men of the backwoods.\r\nIf it be true, we are of opinion that the doggie's family is the most\r\nmiscellaneous and remarkable on the face of--or, as Henri said, in the\r\nbo'-els--of the earth.\r\n\r\nDick and his friends were so deeply absorbed in watching these curious\r\nlittle creatures that they did not observe the rapid spread of the black\r\nclouds over the sky.  _A_ few heavy drops of rain now warned them to\r\nseek shelter, so wheeling round they dashed off at speed for the clump\r\nof willows, which they gained just as the rain began to descend in\r\ntorrents.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, do it slick.  Off packs and saddles,\" cried Joe Blunt,\r\njumping from his horse.  \"I'll make a hut for ye, right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hut, Joe! what sort o' hut can ye make here?\" inquired Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll see, boy, in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach! lend me hand here, Dick; de bockle am tight as de hosse's own\r\nskin.  Ah! dere all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what's this?\" exclaimed Dick, as Crusoe advanced with something\r\nin his mouth.  \"I declare, it's a bird of some sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prairie-hen,\" remarked Joe, as Crusoe laid the bird at Dick's feet;\r\n\"capital for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! dat chien is superb! goot dog.  Come here, I vill clap you.\"\r\n\r\nBut Crusoe refused to be caressed.  Meanwhile, Joe and Dick formed a\r\nsort of beehive-looking hut by bending down the stems of a tall bush and\r\nthrusting their points into the ground.  Over this they threw the\r\nlargest buffalo robe, and placed another on the ground below it, on\r\nwhich they laid their packs of goods.  These they further secured\r\nagainst wet by placing several robes over them and a skin of parchment.\r\nThen they sat down on this pile to rest and consider what should be done\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a bad look out,\" said Joe, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"I fear it is,\" replied Dick in a melancholy tone.\r\n\r\nHenri said nothing, but he sighed deeply on looking up at the sky, which\r\nwas now of a uniform watery grey, while black clouds drove athwart it.\r\nThe rain was pouring in torrents, and the wind began to sweep it in\r\nbroad sheets over the plains, and under their slight covering, so that\r\nin a short time they were wet to the skin.  The horses stood meekly\r\nbeside them, with their tails and heads equally pendulous, and Crusoe\r\nsat before his master, looking at him with an expression that seemed to\r\nsay, \"Couldn't you put a stop to this if you were to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"This'll never do.  I'll try to git up a fire,\" said Dick, jumping up in\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n\"Ye may save yerself the trouble,\" remarked Joe, drily--at least as\r\ndrily as was possible in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dick did try, but he failed signally.  Everything was soaked\r\nand saturated.  There were no large trees; most of the bushes were\r\ngreen, and the dead ones were soaked.  The coverings were slobbery; the\r\nskins they sat on were slobbery; the earth itself was slobbery; so Dick\r\nthrew his blanket (which was also slobbery) round his shoulders, and sat\r\ndown beside his companions to grin and bear it.  As for Joe and Henri,\r\nthey were old hands, and accustomed to such circumstances.  From the\r\nfirst they had resigned themselves to their fate, and wrapping their wet\r\nblankets round them sat down, side by side, wisely to endure the evils\r\nthat they could not cure.\r\n\r\nThere is an old rhyme, by whom composed we know not--and it matters\r\nlittle--which runs thus--\r\n\r\n  \"For every evil under the sun\r\n  There is a remedy--or there's none.\r\n  If there is--try and find it;\r\n  If there isn't--never mind it!\"\r\n\r\nThere is deep wisdom here in small compass.  The principle involved\r\ndeserves to be heartily recommended.  Dick never heard of the lines, but\r\nhe knew the principle well; so he began to \"never mind it,\" by sitting\r\ndown beside his companions and whistling vociferously.  As the wind\r\nrendered this a difficult feat he took to singing instead.  After that\r\nhe said, \"Let's eat a bite, Joe, and then go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be all means,\" said Joe, who produced a mass of dried deer's meat from\r\na wallet.\r\n\r\n\"It's cold grub,\" said Dick, \"and tough.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hunters' teeth were sharp and strong, so they ate a hearty\r\nsupper and washed it down with a drink of rain water collected from a\r\npool on the top of their hut.  They now tried to sleep, for the night\r\nwas advancing, and it was so dark that they could scarce see their hands\r\nwhen held up before their faces.  They sat back to back, and thus, in\r\nthe form of a tripod, began to snooze.  Joe's and Henri's seasoned\r\nframes would have remained stiff as posts till morning; but Dick's body\r\nwas young and pliant, so he hadn't been asleep a few seconds when he\r\nfell forward into the mud and effectually awakened the others.  Joe gave\r\na grunt, and Henri exclaimed, \"Hah!\" but Dick was too sleepy and\r\nmiserable to say anything.  Crusoe, however, rose up to show his\r\nsympathy, and laid his wet head on his master's knee as he resumed his\r\nplace.  This catastrophe happened three times in the space of an hour,\r\nand by the third time they were all wakened up so thoroughly that they\r\ngave up the attempt to sleep, and amused each other by recounting their\r\nhunting experiences and telling stories.  So engrossed did they become\r\nthat day broke sooner than they had expected--and just in proportion as\r\nthe grey light of dawn rose higher into the eastern sky did the spirits\r\nof these weary men rise within their soaking bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE \"WALLERING\" PECULIARITIES OF BUFFALO BULLS--THE FIRST BUFFALO HUNT\r\nAND ITS CONSEQUENCES--CRUSOE COMES TO THE RESCUE--PAWNEES DISCOVERED--A\r\nMONSTER BUFFALO HUNT--JOE ACTS THE PART OF AMBASSADOR.\r\n\r\nFortunately the day that succeeded the dreary night described in the\r\nlast chapter was warm and magnificent.  The sun rose in a blaze of\r\nsplendour and filled the atmosphere with steam from the moist earth.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunates in the wet camp were not slow to avail themselves of\r\nhis cheering rays.  They hung up everything on the bushes to dry, and by\r\ndint of extreme patience and cutting out the comparatively dry hearts of\r\nseveral pieces of wood, they lighted a fire and boiled some rain water,\r\nwhich was soon converted into soup.  This, and the exercise necessary\r\nfor the performance of these several duties, warmed and partially dried\r\nthem, so that when they once more mounted their steeds and rode away\r\nthey were in a state of comparative comfort and in excellent spirits.\r\nThe only annoyance was the clouds of mosquitoes and large flies that\r\nassailed men and horses whenever they checked their speed.\r\n\r\n\"I tell ye wot it is,\" said Joe Blunt, one fine morning about a week\r\nafter they had begun to cross the prairie, \"it's my 'pinion that we'll\r\ncome on buffaloes soon.  Them tracks are fresh, an' yonder's one o'\r\ntheir wallers that's bin used not long agone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go have a look at it,\" cried Dick, trotting away as he spoke.\r\n\r\nEverything in these vast prairies was new to Dick Varley, and he was\r\nkept in a constant state of excitement during the first week or two of\r\nhis journey.  It is true he was quite familiar with the names and habits\r\nof all the animals that dwelt there, for many a time and oft had he\r\nlistened to the \"yarns\" of the hunters and trappers of the Mustang\r\nValley, when they returned laden with rich furs from their periodical\r\nhunting expeditions.  But this knowledge of his only served to whet his\r\ncuriosity and his desire to _see_ the denizens of the prairies with his\r\nown eyes, and now that his wish was accomplished, it greatly increased\r\nthe pleasures of his journey.\r\n\r\nDick had just reached the \"wallow\" referred to by Joe Blunt, and had\r\nreined up his steed to observe it leisurely, when a faint hissing sound\r\nreached his ear.  Looking quickly back he observed his two companions\r\ncrouching on the necks of their horses, and slowly descending into a\r\nhollow of the prairie in front of them, as if they wished to bring the\r\nrising ground between them and some object in advance.  Dick instantly\r\nfollowed their example and was soon at their heels.\r\n\r\n\"Ye needn't look at the waller,\" whispered Joe, \"for a' t'other side o'\r\nthe ridge there's a bull _wallerin'_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye don't mean it!\" exclaimed Dick, as they all dismounted and picketed\r\ntheir horses to the plain.\r\n\r\n\"Oui,\" said Henri, tumbling off his horse, while a broad grin overspread\r\nhis good-natured countenance; \"it is one fact!  One buffalo bull be\r\nwollerin' like a enormerous hog.  Also, dere be t'ousands o' buffaloes\r\nfarder on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can ye trust yer dog keepin' back?\" inquired Joe, with a dubious glance\r\nat Crusoe.\r\n\r\n\"Trust him!  Ay, I wish I was as sure o' myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look to your primin', then, an' we'll have tongues and marrow-bones for\r\nsupper to-night, I'se warrant.  Hist! down on yer knees, and go softly.\r\nWe might ha' run them down on horseback, but its bad to wind yer beasts\r\non a trip like this, if ye can help it; an' it's about as easy to stalk\r\nthem.  Leastways, we'll try.  Lift yer head slowly, Dick, an' don't show\r\nmore nor the half o't above the ridge.\"\r\n\r\nDick elevated his head as directed, and the scene that met his view was\r\nindeed well calculated to send an electric shock to the heart of an\r\nardent sportsman.  The vast plain beyond was absolutely blackened with\r\ncountless herds of buffaloes, which were browsing on the rich grass.\r\nThey were still so far distant that their bellowing, and the trampling\r\nof their myriad hoofs, only reached the hunters like a faint murmur on\r\nthe breeze.  In the immediate foreground, however, there was a group of\r\nabout half a dozen buffalo cows feeding quietly, and in the midst of\r\nthem an enormous old bull was enjoying himself in his wallow.  The\r\nanimals, towards which our hunters now crept with murderous intent, are\r\nthe fiercest and the most ponderous of the ruminating inhabitants of the\r\nwestern wilderness.  The name of buffalo, however, is not correct.  The\r\nanimal is the _bison_, and bears no resemblance whatever to the buffalo\r\nproper; but as the hunters of the far west--and, indeed, travellers\r\ngenerally, have adopted the misnomer, we bow to the authority of custom\r\nand adopt it too.\r\n\r\nBuffaloes roam in countless thousands all over the North American\r\nprairies, from the Hudson's Bay territories, north of Canada, to the\r\nshores of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe advance of white men to the west has driven them to the prairies\r\nbetween the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and has somewhat\r\ndiminished their numbers; but even thus diminished, they are still\r\ninnumerable in the more distant plains.  Their colour is dark brown, but\r\nit varies a good deal with the seasons.  The hair or fur, from its great\r\nlength in winter and spring and exposure to the weather, turns quite\r\nlight; but when the winter coat is shed off the new growth is a\r\nbeautiful dark brown, almost approaching to jet-black.  In form the\r\nbuffalo somewhat resembles the ox, but its head and shoulders are much\r\nlarger, and are covered with a profusion of long shaggy hair, which adds\r\ngreatly to the fierce aspect of the animal.  It has a large hump on the\r\nshoulder, and its fore-quarters are much larger, in proportion, than the\r\nhindquarters.  The horns are short and thick; the hoofs are cloven, and\r\nthe tail is short, with a tuft of hair at the extremity.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to conceive a wilder or more ferocious and\r\nterrible monster than a buffalo bull.  He often grows to the enormous\r\nweight of two thousand pounds.  His lion-like mane falls in shaggy\r\nconfusion quite over his head and shoulders, down to the ground.  When\r\nhe is wounded he becomes imbued with the spirit of a tiger; he stamps,\r\nbellows, roars, and foams forth his rage with glaring eyes and steaming\r\nnostrils; and charges furiously at man and horse with utter\r\nrecklessness.  Fortunately, however, he is not naturally pugnacious, and\r\ncan be easily thrown into a sudden panic.  Moreover, the peculiar\r\nposition of his eye renders this creature not so terrible as he would\r\notherwise be to the hunter.  Owing to the stiff structure of the neck,\r\nand the sunken, downward-looking eyeball, the buffalo cannot, without an\r\neffort, see beyond the direct line of vision presented to the habitual\r\ncarriage of his head.  When, therefore, he is wounded, and charges, he\r\ndoes so in a straight line, so that his pursuer can leap easily out of\r\nhis way.  The pace of the buffalo is clumsy, and _apparently_ slow, yet,\r\nwhen chased, he dashes away over the plains in blind blundering terror,\r\nat a rate that leaves all but good horses far behind.  He cannot keep\r\nthe pace up, however, and is usually soon overtaken.  Were the buffalo\r\ncapable of the same alert and agile motions of head and eye peculiar to\r\nthe deer or wild horse, in addition to his \"bovine rage,\" he would be\r\nthe most formidable brute on earth.  There is no object, perhaps, so\r\nterrible as the headlong advance of a herd of these animals when\r\nthoroughly aroused by terror.  They care not for their necks.  All\r\ndanger in front is forgotten, or not seen, in the terror of that from\r\nwhich they fly.  No thundering cataract is more tremendously\r\nirresistible than the black bellowing torrent which sometimes pours\r\nthrough the narrow defiles of the Rocky Mountains, or sweeps like a\r\nroaring flood over the trembling plains.\r\n\r\nThe wallowing, to which we have referred, is a luxury usually indulged\r\nin during the hot months of summer, when the buffaloes are tormented by\r\nflies, and heat, and drought.  At this season they seek the low grounds\r\nin the prairies where there is a little stagnant water lying amongst the\r\ngrass, and the ground underneath, being saturated, is soft.  The leader\r\nof the herd, a shaggy old bull, usually takes upon himself to prepare\r\nthe wallow.\r\n\r\nIt was a rugged monster of the largest size that did so on the present\r\noccasion, to the intense delight of Dick Varley, who begged Joe to lie\r\nstill and watch the operation before trying to shoot one of the buffalo\r\ncows.  Joe consented with a nod, and the four spectators--for Crusoe was\r\nas much taken up with the proceedings as any of them--crouched in the\r\ngrass, and looked on.\r\n\r\nComing up to the swampy spot the old bull gave a grunt of satisfaction,\r\nand, going down on one knee, plunged his short thick horns into the mud,\r\ntore it up, and cast it aside.  Having repeated this several times he\r\nplunged his head in, and brought it forth saturated with dirty water,\r\nand bedaubed with lumps of mud, through which his fierce eyes gazed,\r\nwith a ludicrous expression of astonishment, straight in the direction\r\nof the hunters, as if he meant to say, \"I've done it that time, and no\r\nmistake!\"  The other buffaloes seemed to think so too, for they came up\r\nand looked, on with an expression that seemed to say, \"Well done, old\r\nfellow; try that again!\"\r\n\r\nThe old fellow did try it again, and again, and again, plunging, and\r\nramming, and tearing up the earth, until he formed an excavation large\r\nenough to contain his huge body.  In this bath he laid himself\r\ncomfortably down, and began to roll and wallow about until he mixed up a\r\ntrough full of thin soft mud, which completely covered him.  When he\r\ncame out of the hole there was scarcely an atom of his former self\r\nvisible!\r\n\r\nThe coat of mud thus put on by bulls is usually permitted by them to\r\ndry, and is not finally got rid of until long after, when oft-repeated\r\nrollings on the grass and washings by rain at length clear it away.\r\n\r\nWhen the old bull vacated this delectable bath, another bull, scarcely,\r\nif at all, less ferocious-looking, stepped forward to take his turn, but\r\nhe was interrupted by a volley from the hunters, which scattered the\r\nanimals right and left, and sent the mighty herds in the distance flying\r\nover the prairie in wild terror.  The very turmoil of their own mad\r\nflight added to their panic, and the continuous thunder of their hoofs\r\nwas heard until the last of them disappeared on the horizon.  The family\r\nparty which had been fired at, however, did not escape so well.  Joe's\r\nrifle wounded a fat young cow, and Dick Varley brought it down.  Henri\r\nhad done his best, but, as the animals were too far distant for his\r\nlimited vision, he missed the cow he fired at and hit the young bull\r\nwhose bath had been interrupted.  The others scattered and fled.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Dick,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, as they all ran up to the cow\r\nthat had fallen.  \"Your first shot at the buffalo was a good 'un.  Come\r\nnow an I'll show ye how to cut it up an' carry off the titbits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! mon dear ole bull,\" exclaimed Henri, gazing after the animal which\r\nhe had wounded, and which was now limping slowly away.  \"You is not\r\nworth goin' after.  Varewell,--adieu.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be tough enough, I warrant,\" said Joe, \"an' we've more meat here\r\nnor we can lift.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wouldn't it be as well to put the poor brute out o' pain?\"\r\nsuggested Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he'll die soon enough,\" replied Joe, tucking up his sleeves and\r\ndrawing his long hunting-knife.\r\n\r\nDick, however, was not satisfied with this way of looking at it.  Saying\r\nthat he would be back in a few minutes he re-loaded his rifle, and\r\ncalling Crusoe to his side, walked quickly after the wounded bull, which\r\nwas now hid from view in a hollow of the plain.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he came in sight of it, and ran forward with his rifle\r\nin readiness.\r\n\r\n\"Down, Crusoe,\" he whispered; \"wait for me here.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe crouched in the grass instantly, and Dick advanced.  As he came\r\non, the bull observed him, and turned round bellowing with rage and pain\r\nto receive him.  The aspect of the brute on a near view was so terrible,\r\nthat Dick involuntarily stopped too, and gazed with a mingled feeling of\r\nwonder and awe, while it bristled with passion, and blood-streaked foam\r\ndropped from its open jaws, and its eyes glared furiously.  Seeing that\r\nDick did not advance, the bull charged him with a terrific roar; but the\r\nyouth had firm nerves, and although the rush of such a savage creature\r\nat full speed was calculated to try the courage of any man, especially\r\none who had never seen a buffalo bull before, Dick did not lose presence\r\nof mind.  He remembered the many stories he had listened to of this very\r\nthing that was now happening, so, crushing down his excitement as well\r\nas he could, he cocked his rifle and awaited the charge.  He knew that\r\nit was of no use to fire at the head of the advancing foe, as the\r\nthickness of the skull, together with the matted hair on the forehead,\r\nrendered it impervious to a bullet.\r\n\r\nWhen the bull was within a yard of him he leaped lightly to one side and\r\nit passed.  Just as it did so, Dick aimed at its heart and fired, but\r\nhis knowledge of the creature's anatomy was not yet correct.  The ball\r\nentered the shoulder too high, and the bull, checking himself as well as\r\nhe could in his headlong rush, turned round and made at Dick again.\r\n\r\nThe failure coupled with the excitement proved too much for Dick; he\r\ncould not resist discharging his second barrel at the brute's head as it\r\ncame on.  He might as well have fired at a brick wall; it shook its\r\nshaggy front, and with a hideous bellow thundered forward.  Again Dick\r\nsprang to one side, but in doing so a tuft of grass or a stone caught\r\nhis foot, and he fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nUp to this point Crusoe's admirable training had nailed him to the spot\r\nwhere he had been left, although the twitching of every fibre in his\r\nbody and a low continuous whine showed how gladly he would have hailed\r\npermission to join in the combat; but the instant he saw his master down\r\nand the buffalo turning to charge again, he sprang forward with a roar\r\nthat would have done credit to his bovine enemy, and seized him by the\r\nnose.  So vigorous was the rush that he well-nigh pulled the bull down\r\non its side.  One toss of its head, however, sent Crusoe high into the\r\nair, but it accomplished this feat at the expense of its nose, which was\r\ntorn and lacerated by the dog's teeth.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Crusoe touched the ground, which he did with a sounding\r\nthump, than he sprang up and flew at his adversary again.  This time,\r\nhowever, he adopted the plan of barking furiously and biting by rapid\r\nyet terrible snaps as he found opportunity, thus keeping the bull\r\nentirely engrossed, and affording Dick an opportunity of re-loading his\r\nrifle, which he was not slow to do.  Dick then stepped close up, and,\r\nwhile the two combatants were roaring in each other's face; he shot the\r\nbuffalo through the heart.  It fell to the earth with a deep groan.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's rage instantly vanished on beholding this, and he seemed to be\r\nfilled with tumultuous joy at his master's escape, for he gambolled\r\nround him, and whined and fawned upon him in a manner that could not be\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n\"Good dog; thank'ee, my pup,\" said Dick, patting Crusoe's head as he\r\nstooped to brush the dust from his leggings; \"I don't know what would\r\nha' become o' me but for your help, Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe turned his head a little to one side, wagged his tail, and looked\r\nat Dick with an expression that said quite plainly, \"I'd die for you, I\r\nwould--not once, or twice, but ten times, fifty times if need be--and\r\nthat not merely to save your life, but even to please you.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that Crusoe felt something of this sort.  The\r\nlove of a Newfoundland dog to its master is beyond calculation or\r\nexpression.  He who once gains such love carries the dog's life in his\r\nhand.  But let him who reads note well, and remember, that there is only\r\none coin that can purchase such love, and that is _kindness_; the coin,\r\ntoo, must be genuine.  Kindness merely _expressed_ will not do, it must\r\nbe _felt_.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! boy, ye've bin i' the wars!\" exclaimed Joe, raising himself from\r\nhis task as Dick and Crusoe returned.\r\n\r\n\"You look more like it than I do,\" retorted Dick, laughing.\r\n\r\nThis was true, for cutting up a buffalo carcase with no other instrument\r\nthan a large knife is no easy matter.  Yet western hunters and Indians\r\ncan do it without cleaver or saw, in a way that would surprise a\r\ncivilised butcher not a little.  Joe was covered with blood up to the\r\nelbows.  His hair, happening to have a knack of getting into his eyes,\r\nhad been so often brushed off with bloody hands, that his whole visage\r\nwas speckled with gore, and his dress was by no means immaculate.\r\n\r\nWhile Dick related his adventure, or _mis-adventure_ with the bull, Joe\r\nand Henri completed the cutting out of the most delicate portions of the\r\nbuffalo, namely, the hump on its shoulder--which is a choice piece, much\r\nfiner than the best beef--and the tongue, and a few other parts.  The\r\ntongues of buffaloes are superior to those of domestic cattle.  When all\r\nwas ready the meat was slung across the back of the pack-horse, and the\r\nparty, remounting their horses, continued their journey, having first\r\ncleansed themselves as well as they could in the rather dirty waters of\r\nan old wallow.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said Henri, turning to Dick and pointing to a circular spot of\r\ngreen as they rode along, \"that is one old _dry_ waller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" remarked Joe, \"after the waller dries, it becomes a ring o'\r\ngreener grass than the rest o' the plain, as ye see.  'Tis said the\r\nfirst hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster'ous circles, and\r\nthey invented all sorts o' stories to account for 'em.  Some said they\r\nwos fairy-rings, but at last they comed to know they wos nothin' more\r\nnor less than places where buffaloes wos used to waller in.  It's often\r\nseemed to me that if we knowed the _raisons_ o' things we wouldn't be so\r\nmuch puzzled wi' them as we are.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this last remark was so self-evident and incontrovertible\r\nthat it elicited no reply, and the three friends rode on for a\r\nconsiderable time in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was now past noon, and they were thinking of calling a halt for a\r\nshort rest to the horses and a pipe to themselves, when Joe was heard to\r\ngive vent to one of those peculiar hisses that always accompanied either\r\na surprise or a caution.  In the present case it indicated both.\r\n\r\n\"What now, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Injuns!\" ejaculated Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! fat you say? ou is de?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe at this moment uttered a low growl.  Ever since the day he had\r\nbeen partially roasted he had maintained a rooted antipathy to Red-men.\r\nJoe immediately dismounted, and placing his ear to the ground listened\r\nintently.  It is a curious fact that by placing the ear close to the\r\nground sounds can be heard distinctly which could not be heard at all if\r\nthe listener were to maintain an erect position.\r\n\r\n\"They're arter the buffalo,\" said Joe, rising, \"an' I think it's likely\r\nthey're a band o' Pawnees.  Listen an' ye'll hear their shouts quite\r\nplain.\"\r\n\r\nDick and Henri immediately lay down and placed their ears to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Now, me hear noting,\" said Henri, jumping up, \"but me ear is like me\r\neyes; ver' short-sighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do hear something,\" said Dick as he got up, \"but the beating o' my\r\nown heart makes row enough to spoil my hearin'.\"\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt smiled.  \"Ah! lad, yer young an' yer blood's too hot yet, but\r\nbide a bit; you'll cool down soon.  I wos like you once.  Now, lads,\r\nwhat think ye we should do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know best, Joe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, nodoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then wot I advise is that we gallop to the broken sand hillocks ye see\r\nyonder, get behind them an' take a peep at the Red-skins.  If they are\r\nPawnees we'll go up to them at once; if not, we'll hold a council o' war\r\non the spot.\"\r\n\r\nHaving arranged this they mounted and hastened towards the hillocks in\r\nquestion, which they reached after ten minutes' gallop, at full stretch.\r\nThe sandy mounds afforded them concealment, and enabled them to watch\r\nthe proceedings of the savages in the plain below.  The scene was the\r\nmost curious and exciting that can be conceived.  The centre of the\r\nplain before them was crowded with hundreds of buffaloes, which were\r\ndashing about in the most frantic state of alarm.  To whatever point\r\nthey galloped they were met by yelling savages on horseback, who could\r\nnot have been fewer in numbers than a thousand--all being armed with\r\nlance, bow, and quiver, and mounted on active little horses.  The\r\nIndians had completely surrounded the herd of buffaloes, and were now\r\nadvancing steadily towards them, gradually narrowing the circle, and,\r\nwhenever the terrified animals endeavoured to break through the line,\r\nthey rushed to that particular spot in a body, and scared them back\r\nagain into the centre.\r\n\r\nThus they advanced until they closed in on their prey, and formed an\r\nunbroken circle round them, whilst the poor brutes kept eddying and\r\nsurging to and fro in a confused mass, hooking and climbing upon each\r\nother, and bellowing furiously.  Suddenly the horsemen made a rush, and\r\nthe work of destruction began.  The tremendous turmoil raised a cloud of\r\ndust that obscured the field in some places, and hid it from our\r\nhunters' view.  Some of the Indians galloped round and round the circle,\r\nsending their arrows whizzing up to the feathers in the sides of the\r\nfattest cows.  Others dashed fearlessly into the midst of the black\r\nheaving mass, and, with their long lances, pierced dozens of them to the\r\nheart.  In many instances the buffaloes, infuriated by wounds, turned\r\nfiercely on their assailants and gored the horses to death, in which\r\ncases the men had to trust to their nimble legs for safety.  Sometimes a\r\nhorse got jammed in the centre of the swaying mass, and could neither\r\nadvance nor retreat.  Then the savage rider leaped upon the buffaloes'\r\nbacks, and springing from one to another, like an acrobat, gained the\r\nouter edge of the circle, not failing, however, in his strange flight,\r\nto pierce with his lance several of the fattest of his stepping-stones\r\nas he sped along.\r\n\r\nA few of the herd succeeded in escaping from the blood and dust of this\r\ndesperate battle, and made off over the plains, but they were quickly\r\novertaken, and the lance or arrow brought them down on the green turf.\r\nMany of the dismounted riders were chased by bulls, but they stepped\r\nlightly to one side, and, as the animals passed, drove their arrows deep\r\ninto their sides.  Thus the tumultuous war went on, amid thundering\r\ntread, and yell, and bellow, till the green plain was transformed into a\r\nsea of blood and mire, and every buffalo of the herd was laid low.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that such reckless warfare is invariably waged\r\nwithout damage to the savages.  Many were the wounds and bruises\r\nreceived that day, and not a few bones were broken, but happily no lives\r\nwere lost.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, now's our time.  A bold and fearless look's the best at all\r\ntimes.  Don't look as if ye doubted their friendship; and mind, wotever\r\nye do, don't use yer arms.  Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Joe Blunt leaped on his horse, and, bounding over the ridge\r\nat full speed, galloped headlong across the plain.\r\n\r\nThe savages observed the strangers instantly, and a loud yell announced\r\nthe fact as they assembled from all parts of the field brandishing their\r\nbows and spears.  Joe's quick eye soon distinguished their chief,\r\ntowards whom he galloped, still at full speed, till within a yard or two\r\nof his horse's head; then he reined up suddenly.  So rapidly did Joe and\r\nhis comrades approach, and so instantaneously did they pull up, that\r\ntheir steeds were thrown almost on their haunches.\r\n\r\nThe Indian chief did not move a muscle.  He was a tall powerful savage,\r\nalmost naked, and mounted on a coal-black charger, which he sat with the\r\nease of a man accustomed to ride from infancy.  He was, indeed, a\r\nsplendid-looking savage, but his face wore a dark frown, for, although\r\nhe and his band had visited the settlements and trafficked with the\r\nfur-traders on the Missouri, he did not love the \"Pale-faces,\" whom he\r\nregarded as intruders on the hunting grounds of his fathers, and the\r\npeace that existed between them at that time was of a very fragile\r\ncharacter.  Indeed, it was deemed by the traders impossible to travel\r\nthrough the Indian country at that period except in strong force, and it\r\nwas the very boldness of the present attempt that secured to our hunters\r\nanything like a civil reception.\r\n\r\nJoe, who could speak the Pawnee tongue fluently, began by explaining the\r\nobject of his visit, and spoke of the presents which he had brought for\r\nthe great chief; but it was evident that his words made little\r\nimpression.  As he discoursed to them the savages crowded round the\r\nlittle party, and began to handle and examine their dresses and weapons\r\nwith a degree of rudeness that caused Joe considerable anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Mahtawa believes that the heart of the Pale-face is true,\" said the\r\nsavage, when Joe paused, \"but he does not choose to make peace.  The\r\nPale-faces are grasping.  They never rest.  They turn their eyes to the\r\ngreat mountains, and say, `There we will stop.'  But even there they\r\nwill not stop.  They are never satisfied, Mahtawa knows them well.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech sank like a death-knell into the hearts of the hunters, for\r\nthey knew that if the savages refused to make peace, they would scalp\r\nthem all and appropriate their goods.  To make things worse, a\r\ndark-visaged Indian suddenly caught hold of Henri's rifle, and, ere he\r\nwas aware, plucked it from his hand.  The blood rushed to the gigantic\r\nhunter's forehead, and he was on the point of springing at the man, when\r\nJoe said in a deep, quiet voice--\r\n\r\n\"Be still, Henri.  You will but hasten death.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a movement in the outskirts of the circle of\r\nhorsemen, and another chief rode into the midst of them.  He was\r\nevidently higher in rank than Mahtawa, for he spoke authoritatively to\r\nthe crowd, and stepped in before him.  The hunters drew little comfort\r\nfrom the appearance of his face, however, for it scowled upon them.  He\r\nwas not so powerful a man as Mahtawa, but he was more gracefully formed,\r\nand had a more noble and commanding countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Have the Pale-faces no wigwams on the great river that they should come\r\nto spy out the lands of the Pawnee?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"We have not come to spy your country,\" answered Joe, raising himself\r\nproudly as he spoke, and taking off his cap.  \"We have come with a\r\nmessage from the great chief of the Pale-faces, who lives in the village\r\nfar beyond the great river where the sun rises.  He says, why should the\r\nPale-face and the Red-man fight?  They are brothers.  The same Manitou\r\n[the Indian name for God] watches over both.  The Pale-faces have more\r\nbeads, and guns, and blankets, and knives, and vermilion than they\r\nrequire; they wish to give some of these things for the skins and furs\r\nwhich the Red-man does not know what to do with.  The great chief of the\r\nPale-faces has sent me to say, `Why should we fight? let us smoke the\r\npipe of peace!'\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of beads and blankets the face of the wily chief\r\nbrightened for a moment.  Then he said, sternly--\r\n\r\n\"The heart of the Pale-face is not true.  He has come here to trade for\r\nhimself.  San-it-sa-rish has eyes that can see--they are not shut.  Are\r\nnot these your goods?\"  The chief pointed to the pack-horse as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Trappers do not take their goods into the heart of an enemy's camp,\"\r\nreturned Joe; \"San-it-sa-rish is wise and will understand this.  These\r\nare gifts to the chief of the Pawnees.  There are more awaiting him when\r\nthe pipe of peace is smoked.  I have said,--What message shall we take\r\nback to the great chief of the Pale-faces?\"\r\n\r\nSan-it-sa-rish was evidently mollified.\r\n\r\n\"The hunting field is not the council tent,\" he said.  \"The Pale-faces\r\nwill go with us to our village.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Joe was only too glad to agree to this proposal, but he now\r\ndeemed it politic to display a little firmness.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot go till our rifle is restored.  It will not do to go back and\r\ntell the great chief of the Pale-faces that the Pawnees are thieves.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief frowned angrily.\r\n\r\n\"The Pawnees are true--they are not thieves.  They choose to _look_ at\r\nthe rifle of the Pale-face.  It shall be returned.\"\r\n\r\nThe rifle was instantly restored, and then our hunters rode off with the\r\nIndians towards their camp.  On the way they met hundreds of women and\r\nchildren going to the scene of the great hunt, for it was their special\r\nduty to cut up the meat and carry it into camp.  The men, considering\r\nthat they had done quite enough in killing it, returned to smoke and eat\r\naway the fatigues of the chase.\r\n\r\nAs they rode along Dick Varley observed that some of the \"braves,\" as\r\nIndian warriors are styled, were eating pieces of the bloody livers of\r\nthe buffaloes in a raw state, at which he expressed not a little\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! boy, you're green yet,\" remarked Joe Blunt in an undertone.\r\n\"Mayhap ye'll be thankful to do that same yerself some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll not refuse to try when it is needful,\" said Dick with a\r\nlaugh; \"meanwhile I'm content to see the Red-skins do it, Joe Blunt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nDICK AND HIS FRIENDS VISIT THE INDIANS AND SEE MANY WONDERS--CRUSOE,\r\nTOO, EXPERIENCES A FEW SURPRISES AND TEACHES INDIAN DOGS A LESSON--AN\r\nINDIAN DANDY--A FOOT-RACE.\r\n\r\nThe Pawnee village, at which they soon arrived, was situated in the\r\nmidst of a most interesting and picturesque scene.\r\n\r\nIt occupied an extensive plain which sloped gently down to a creek, [In\r\nAmerica small rivers or riverlets are termed \"creeks\"] whose winding\r\ncourse was marked by a broken line of wood, here and there interspersed\r\nwith a fine clump of trees, between the trunks of which the blue waters\r\nof the lake sparkled in the distance.  Hundreds of tents or \"lodges\" of\r\nbuffalo skins covered the ground, and thousand of Indians--men, women,\r\nand children--moved about the busy scene.  Some were sitting in their\r\nlodges, lazily smoking their pipes.  But these were chiefly old and\r\ninfirm veterans, for all the young men had gone to the hunt which we\r\nhave just described.  The women were stooping over their fires, busily\r\npreparing maize and meat for their husbands and brothers, while myriads\r\nof little brown and naked children romped about everywhere, filling the\r\nair with their yells and screams, which were only equalled, if not\r\nsurpassed, by the yelping dogs that seemed innumerable.\r\n\r\nFar as the eye could reach were seen scattered herds of horses.  These\r\nwere tended by little boys who were totally destitute of clothing, and\r\nwho seemed to enjoy with infinite zest the pastime of shooting-practice\r\nwith little bows and arrows.  No wonder that these Indians become expert\r\nbowmen.  There were urchins there, scarce two feet high, with round\r\nbullets of bodies and short spindle-shanks, who could knock blackbirds\r\noff the trees at every shot, and cut the heads of the taller flowers\r\nwith perfect certainty!  There was much need, too, for the utmost\r\nproficiency they could attain, for the very existence of the Indian\r\ntribes of the prairies depends on their success in hunting the buffalo.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds and thousands of North American savages who would\r\nundoubtedly perish and their tribes become extinct if the buffaloes were\r\nto leave the prairies or die out.  Yet, although animals are absolutely\r\nessential to their existence, they pursue and slay them with improvident\r\nrecklessness, sometimes killing hundreds of them merely for the sake of\r\nthe sport, the tongues, and the marrow-bones.  In the bloody hunt\r\ndescribed in the last chapter, however, the slaughter of so many was not\r\nwanton, because the village that had to be supplied with food was large,\r\nand, just previous to the hunt, they had been living on somewhat reduced\r\nallowance.  Even the blackbirds, shot by the brown-bodied urchins before\r\nmentioned, had been thankfully put into the pot.  Thus precarious is the\r\nsupply of food among the Red-men, who on one day are starving, and the\r\nnext are revelling in superabundance.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our story.  At one end of this village the creek sprang\r\nover a ledge of rock in a low cascade and opened out into a beautiful\r\nlake, the bosom of which was studded with small islands.  Here were\r\nthousands of those smaller species of wild water-fowl which were either\r\ntoo brave or too foolish to be scared away by the noise of the camp.\r\nAnd here, too, dozens of children were sporting on the beach or paddling\r\nabout in their light bark canoes.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it strange,\" remarked Dick to Henri, as they passed among the\r\ntents towards the centre of the village, \"isn't it strange that them\r\nInjuns should be so fond o' fightin' when they've got all they can\r\nwant--a fine country, lots o' buffalo, an' as far as I can see, happy\r\nhomes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, it is remarkaibel, vraiment.  But dey do more love war to peace.\r\nDey loves to be excited, I s'pose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!  One would think the hunt we seed a little agone would be\r\nexcitement enough.  But, I say, that must be the chief's tent, by the\r\nlook o't.\"\r\n\r\nDick was right; the horsemen pulled up and dismounted opposite the\r\nprincipal chief's tent, which was a larger and more elegant structure\r\nthan the others.  Meanwhile an immense concourse of women, children, and\r\ndogs gathered round the strangers, and, while the latter yelped their\r\ndislike to white men, the former chattered continuously, as they\r\ndiscussed the appearance of the strangers and their errand, which latter\r\nsoon became known.  An end was put to this by San-it-sa-rish desiring\r\nthe hunters to enter the tent, and spreading a buffalo robe for them to\r\nsit on.  Two braves carried in their packs and then led away their\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nAll this time Crusoe had kept as close as possible to his master's side,\r\nfeeling extremely uncomfortable in the midst of such a strange crowd,\r\nthe more especially that the ill-looking Indian curs gave him expressive\r\nlooks of hatred, and exhibited some desire to rush upon him in a body,\r\nso that he had to keep a sharp look out all round him.  When, therefore,\r\nDick entered the tent Crusoe endeavoured to do so along with him, but he\r\nwas met by a blow on the nose from an old squaw, who scolded him in a\r\nshrill voice and bade him begone.\r\n\r\nEither our hero's knowledge of the Indian language was insufficient to\r\nenable him to understand the order, or he had resolved not to obey it,\r\nfor instead of retreating he drew a deep gurgling breath, curled his\r\nnose, and displayed a row of teeth that caused the old woman to draw\r\nback in alarm.  Crusoe's was a forgiving spirit.  The instant that\r\nopposition ceased he forgot the injury, and was meekly advancing when\r\nDick held up his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Go outside, pup, and wait.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe's tail drooped; with a deep sigh he turned and left the tent.  He\r\ntook up a position near the entrance, however, and sat down resignedly.\r\nSo meek, indeed, did the poor dog look, that six mangy-looking curs felt\r\ntheir dastardly hearts emboldened to make a rush at him with boisterous\r\nyells.\r\n\r\nCrusoe did not rise.  He did not even condescend to turn his head toward\r\nthem, but he looked at them out of the corner of his dark eye,\r\nwrinkled--very slightly--the skin of his nose, exhibited two beautiful\r\nfangs, and gave utterance to a soft remark, that might be described as\r\nquiet, deep-toned gargling.  It wasn't much, but it was more than enough\r\nfor the valiant six, who paused and snarled violently.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiar trait of Crusoe's gentle nature, that, the moment any\r\ndanger ceased, he resumed his expression of nonchalant gravity.  The\r\nexpression on this occasion was misunderstood, however, and, as about\r\ntwo dozen additional yelping dogs had joined the ranks of the enemy,\r\nthey advanced in close order to the attack.\r\n\r\nCrusoe still sat quiet and kept his head high, but he _looked_ at them\r\nagain and exhibited four fangs for their inspection.  Among the pack\r\nthere was one Indian dog of large size--almost as large as Crusoe\r\nhimself--which kept well in the rear, and apparently urged the lesser\r\ndogs on.  The little dogs didn't object, for little dogs are generally\r\nthe most pugnacious.  At this big dog Crusoe directed a pointed glance,\r\nbut said nothing.  Meanwhile a particularly small and vicious cur, with\r\na mere rag of a tail, crept round by the back of the tent, and, coming\r\nupon Crusoe in the rear, snapped at his tail sharply, and then fled\r\nshrieking with terror and surprise, no doubt, at its own temerity.\r\n\r\nCrusoe did not bark; he seldom barked; he usually either said nothing,\r\nor gave utterance to a prolonged roar of indignation of the most\r\nterrible character with barks, as it were, mingled through it.  It\r\nsomewhat resembled that peculiar and well-known species of thunder, the\r\nprolonged roll of which is marked at short intervals in its course by\r\ncannon-like cracks.  It was a continuous, but, so to speak, _knotted_\r\nroar.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the snap, Crusoe gave forth _the_ roar with a majesty and\r\npower that scattered the pugnacious front rank of the enemy to the\r\nwinds.  Those that still remained, half stupefied, he leaped over with a\r\nhuge bound and alighted, fangs first, on the back of the big dog.  There\r\nwas one hideous yell, a muffled scramble of an instant's duration, and\r\nthe big dog lay dead upon the plain!\r\n\r\nIt was an awful thing to do; but Crusoe evidently felt that the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the case required that an example should be made--and\r\nto say truth, all things considered, we cannot blame him.  The news must\r\nhave been carried at once through the canine portion of the camp, for\r\nCrusoe was never interfered with again after that.\r\n\r\nDick witnessed this little incident; but he observed that the Indian\r\nchief cared not a straw about it, and as his dog returned quietly and\r\nsat down in its old place, he took no notice of it either, but continued\r\nto listen to the explanations which Joe gave to the chief, of the desire\r\nof the Pale-faces to be friends with the Red-men.\r\n\r\nJoe's eloquence would have done little for him on this occasion had his\r\nhands been empty; but he followed it up by opening one of his packs, and\r\ndisplaying the glittering contents before the equally glittering eyes of\r\nthe chief and his squaws.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" said Joe, \"are the gifts that the great chief of the Pale-faces\r\nsends to the great chief of the Pawnees, and he bids me say that there\r\nare many more things in his stores which will be traded for skins with\r\nthe Red-men, when they visit him; and he also says that if the Pawnees\r\nwill not steal horses any more from the Pale-faces they shall receive\r\ngifts of knives, and guns, and powder and blankets every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Wah_!\" grunted the chief; \"it is good.  The great chief is wise.  We\r\nwill smoke the pipe of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe things that afforded so much satisfaction to San-it-sa-rish were the\r\nveriest trifles.  Penny looking-glasses in yellow gilt tin frames, beads\r\nof various colours, needles, cheap scissors, and knives, vermilion\r\npaint, and coarse scarlet cloth, etcetera.  They were of priceless\r\nvalue, however, in the estimation of the savages, who delighted to adorn\r\nthemselves with leggings made from the cloth, beautifully worked with\r\nbeads by their own ingenious women.  They were thankful, too, for knives\r\neven of the commonest description, having none but bone ones of their\r\nown; and they gloried in daubing their faces with intermingled streaks\r\nof charcoal and vermilion.  To gaze at their visages, when thus treated,\r\nin the little penny looking-glasses is their summit of delight!\r\n\r\nJoe presented the chief with a portion of these coveted goods and tied\r\nup the remainder.  We may remark here, that the only thing which\r\nprevented the savages from taking possession of the whole at once,\r\nwithout asking permission, was the promise of the annual gifts, which\r\nthey knew would not be forthcoming were any evil to befall the deputies\r\nof the Pale-faces.  Nevertheless, it cost them a severe struggle to\r\nrestrain their hands on this occasion, and Joe and his companions felt\r\nthat they would have to play their part well in order to fulfil their\r\nmission with safety and credit.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-faces may go now and talk with the braves,\" said\r\nSan-it-sa-rish, after carefully examining everything that was given to\r\nhim; \"a council will be called soon, and we will smoke the pipe of\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nAccepting this permission to retire, the hunters immediately left the\r\ntent, and being now at liberty to do what they pleased, they amused\r\nthemselves by wandering about the village.\r\n\r\n\"He's a cute chap that,\" remarked Joe, with a sarcastic smile; \"I don't\r\nfeel quite easy about gettin' away.  He'll bother the life out o' us to\r\nget all the goods we've got, and, ye see, as we've other tribes to\r\nvisit, we must give away as little as we can here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! you is right,\" said Henri; \"dat fellow's eyes twinkle at de knives\r\nand tings like two stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire-flies, ye should say.  Stars are too soft an' beautiful to compare\r\nto the eyes o' yon savage,\" said Dick, laughing.  \"I wish we were well\r\naway from them.  That rascal Mahtawa is an ugly customer.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, lad,\" returned Joe; \"had _he_ bin the great chief our scalps had\r\nbin dryin' in the smoke o' a Pawnee wigwam afore now.  What now, lad?\"\r\n\r\nJoe's question was put in consequence of a gleeful smile that overspread\r\nthe countenance of Dick Varley, who replied by pointing to a wigwam\r\ntowards which they were approaching.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's only a dandy,\" exclaimed Joe.  \"There's lots o' them in\r\nevery Injun camp.  They're fit for nothin' but dress, poor contemptible\r\ncritters.\"\r\n\r\nJoe accompanied his remark with a sneer, for of all pitiable objects, he\r\nregarded an unmanly man as the most despicable.  He consented, however,\r\nto sit down on a grassy bank and watch the proceedings of this Indian\r\ndandy, who had just seated himself in front of his wigwam for the\r\npurpose of making his toilet.\r\n\r\nHe began it by greasing his whole person carefully and smoothly over\r\nwith buffalo-fat, until he shone like a patent leather boot; then he\r\nrubbed himself almost dry, leaving the skin sleek and glossy.  Having\r\nproceeded thus far he took up a small mirror, a few inches in diameter,\r\nwhich he or some other member of the tribe must have procured during one\r\nof their few excursions to the trading forts of the Pale-faces, and\r\nexamined himself, as well as he could, in so limited a space.  Next, he\r\ntook a little vermilion from a small parcel and rubbed it over his face\r\nuntil it presented the somewhat demoniac appearance of a fiery red.  He\r\nalso drew a broad red score along the crown of his head, which was\r\nclosely shaved, with the exception of the usual tuft or scalp-lock on\r\nthe top.  This scalp-lock stood bristling straight up a few inches, and\r\nthen curved over and hung down his back about two feet.  Immense care\r\nand attention was bestowed on this lock.  He smoothed it, greased it,\r\nand plaited it into the form of a pigtail.  Another application was here\r\nmade to the glass, and the result was evidently satisfactory, to judge\r\nfrom the beaming smile that played on his features.  But, not content\r\nwith the general effect, he tried the effect of expression--frowned\r\nportentously, scowled savagely, gaped hideously, and grinned horribly a\r\nghastly smile.\r\n\r\nThen our dandy fitted into his ears, which were bored in several places,\r\nsundry ornaments, such as rings, wampum, etcetera, and hung several\r\nstrings of beads round his neck.  Besides these he affixed one or two\r\nornaments to his arms, wrists, and ankles, and touched in a few effects\r\nwith vermilion on the shoulders and breast.  After this, and a few more\r\nglances at the glass, he put on a pair of beautiful moccasins, which,\r\nbesides being richly wrought with beads, were soft as chamois leather,\r\nand fitted his feet like gloves; a pair of leggings of scarlet cloth\r\nwere drawn on, attached to a waist-belt, and bound below the knee with\r\nbroad garters of variegated bead-work.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before this Adonis was quite satisfied with himself.\r\nHe re-touched the paint on his shoulders several times, and modified the\r\nglare of that on his wide-mouthed, high-cheek-boned visage before he\r\ncould tear himself away; but at last he did so, and, throwing a large\r\npiece of scarlet cloth over his shoulders, he thrust his looking-glass\r\nunder his belt, and proceeded to mount his palfrey, which was held in\r\nreadiness near to the tent door by one of his wives.  The horse was\r\nreally a fine animal, and seemed worthy of a more warlike master.  His\r\nshoulders, too, were striped with red paint, and feathers were\r\nintertwined with his mane and tail, while the bridle was decorated with\r\nvarious jingling ornaments.\r\n\r\nVaulting upon his steed, with a large fan of wild goose and turkey\r\nfeathers in one hand, and a whip dangling at the wrist of the other,\r\nthis incomparable dandy sallied forth for a promenade--that being his\r\nchief delight when there was no buffalo hunting to be done.  Other men\r\nwho were not dandies sharpened their knives, smoked, feasted, and mended\r\ntheir spears and arrows at such seasons of leisure, or played at\r\nathletic games.\r\n\r\n\"Let's follow my buck,\" said Joe Blunt.\r\n\r\n\"Oui.  Come 'long,\" replied Henri, striding after the rider at a pace\r\nthat almost compelled his comrades to run.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" cried Dick, laughing; \"we don't want to keep him company.  A\r\ndistant view is quite enough o' sich a chap as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mais, you forgit, I cannot see far.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" remarked Joe; \"it's my opinion we've seen enough\r\no' him.  Ah! he's goin' to look on at the games.  Them's worth lookin'\r\nat.\"\r\n\r\nThe games to which Joe referred were taking place on a green level plain\r\nclose to the creek, and a little above the waterfall before referred to.\r\nSome of the Indians were horse-racing, some jumping, and others\r\nwrestling; but the game which proved most attractive was throwing the\r\njavelin, in which several of the young braves were engaged.\r\n\r\nThis game is played by two competitors, each armed with a dart, in an\r\narena about fifty yards long.  One of the players has a hoop of six\r\ninches in diameter.  At a signal they start off on foot at full speed,\r\nand on reaching the middle of the arena the Indian with the hoop rolls\r\nit along before them, and each does his best to send a javelin through\r\nthe hoop before the other.  He who succeeds counts so many points--if\r\nboth miss, the nearest to the hoop is allowed to count, but not so much\r\nas if he had \"ringed\" it.  The Indians are very fond of this game, and\r\nwill play at it under a broiling sun for hours together.  But a good\r\ndeal of the interest attaching to it is owing to the fact that they make\r\nit a means of gambling.  Indians are inveterate gamblers, and will\r\nsometimes go on until they lose horses, bows, blankets, robes, and, in\r\nshort, their whole personal property.  The consequences are, as might be\r\nexpected, that fierce and bloody quarrels sometimes arise in which life\r\nis often lost.\r\n\r\n\"Try your hand at that,\" said Henri to Dick.\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" cried Dick, handing his rifle to his friend, and\r\nspringing into the ring enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nA general shout of applause greeted the Pale-face, who threw off his\r\ncoat and tightened his belt, while a young Indian presented him with a\r\ndart.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see that ye do us credit, lad,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they were off.  The young Indian rolled away the hoop, and\r\nDick threw his dart with such vigour that it went deep into the ground,\r\nbut missed the hoop by a foot at least.  The young Indian's first dart\r\nwent through the centre.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Joe Blunt to the Indians near him, \"the lad's not used\r\nto that game, try him at a race.  Bring out your best brave--he whose\r\nbound is like the hunted deer.\"\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely remind the reader that Joe spoke in the Indian\r\nlanguage, and that the above is a correct rendering of the sense of what\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nThe name of Tarwicadia, or the little chief, immediately passed from lip\r\nto lip, and in a few minutes an Indian, a little below the medium size,\r\nbounded into the arena with an indiarubber-like elasticity that caused a\r\nshade of anxiety to pass over Joe's face.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, boy!\" he whispered, \"I'm afeared you'll find him a tough customer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I want,\" replied Dick.  \"He's supple enough, but he\r\nwants muscle in the thigh.  We'll make it a long heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, lad, yer right.\"\r\n\r\nJoe now proceeded to arrange the conditions of the race with the chiefs\r\naround him.  It was fixed that the distance to be run should be a mile,\r\nso that the race would be one of two miles, out and back.  Moreover, the\r\ncompetitors were to run without any clothes, except a belt and a small\r\npiece of cloth round the loins.  This to the Indians was nothing, for\r\nthey seldom wore more in warm weather, but Dick would have preferred to\r\nkeep on part of his dress.  The laws of the course, however, would not\r\npermit of this, so he stripped and stood forth, the beau-ideal of a\r\nwell-formed, agile man.  He was greatly superior in size to his\r\nantagonist, and more muscular, the savage being slender and extremely\r\nlithe and springy.\r\n\r\n\"Hah!  I will run too,\" shouted Henri, bouncing forward with clumsy\r\nenergy, and throwing off his coat just as they were going to start.\r\n\r\nThe savages smiled at this unexpected burst and made no objection,\r\nconsidering the thing in the light of a joke.\r\n\r\nThe signal was given, and away they went.  Oh! it would have done you\r\ngood to have seen the way in which Henri manoeuvred his limbs on this\r\ncelebrated occasion!  He went over the ground with huge elephantine\r\nbounds, runs, and jumps.  He could not have been said to have one style\r\nof running; he had a dozen styles, all of which came into play in the\r\ncourse of half as many minutes.  The other two ran like the wind; yet,\r\nalthough Henri _appeared_ to be going heavily over the ground, he kept\r\nup with them to the turning point.  As for Dick, it became evident in\r\nthe first few minutes that he could outstrip his antagonist with ease,\r\nand was hanging back a little all the time.  He shot ahead like an arrow\r\nwhen they came about half-way back, and it was clear that the real\r\ninterest of the race was to lie in the competition between Henri and\r\nTarwicadia.\r\n\r\nBefore they were two-thirds of the way back, Dick walked in to the\r\nwinning point, and turned to watch the others.  Henri's wind was about\r\ngone, for he exerted himself with such violence that he wasted half his\r\nstrength.  The Indian, on the contrary, was comparatively fresh, but he\r\nwas not so fleet as his antagonist, whose tremendous strides carried him\r\nover the ground at an incredible pace.  On they came neck and neck, till\r\nclose on the score that marked the winning point.  Here the value of\r\nenthusiasm came out strongly in the case of Henri.  He _felt_ that he\r\ncould not gain an inch on Tarwicadia to save his life; but, just as he\r\ncame up, he observed the anxious faces of his comrades and the\r\nhalf-sneering countenances of the savages.  His heart thumped against\r\nhis ribs, every muscle thrilled with a gush of conflicting feelings, and\r\nhe _hurled_ himself over the score like a cannon shot, full six inches\r\nahead of the little chief!\r\n\r\nBut the thing did not by any means end here.  Tarwicadia pulled up the\r\ninstant he had passed.  Not so our Canadian.  Such a clumsy and colossal\r\nframe was not to be checked in a moment.  The crowd of Indians opened up\r\nto let him pass, but unfortunately a small tent that stood in the way\r\nwas not so obliging.  Into it he went, head-foremost, like a shell,\r\ncarried away the corner-post with his shoulder, and brought the whole\r\naffair down about his own ears, and those of its inmates, among whom\r\nwere several children and two or three dogs.  It required some time to\r\nextricate them all from the ruins, but when this was effected, it was\r\nfound that no serious damage had been done to life or limb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nCRUSOE ACTS A CONSPICUOUS AND HUMANE PART--A FRIEND GAINED--A GREAT\r\nFEAST.\r\n\r\nWhen the foot-race was concluded, the three hunters hung about, looking\r\non at the various games for some time, and then strolled towards the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n\"Ye may be thankful yer neck's whole,\" said Joe, grinning, as Henri\r\nrubbed his shoulder with a rueful look.  \"An' we'll have to send that\r\nInjun and his family a knife and some beads to make up for the fright\r\nthey got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! an' fat is to be give to me for my broke shoulder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Credit, man, credit,\" said Dick Varley, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Credit! fat is dat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Honour and glory, lad, and the praises of them savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! de praise? more probeebale de ill-vill of de rascale.  I seed dem\r\nscowl at me not ver' pritty.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, Henri, but sich as it is it's all ye'll git.\"\r\n\r\n\"I vish,\" remarked Henri after a pause--\"I vish I could git de vampum\r\nbelt de leetle chief had on.  It vas superb.  Fat place do vampums come\r\nfrom?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're shells--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui,\" interrupted Henri.  \"I know _fat_ de is.  Dey is shells, and de\r\nInjuns tink dem goot monish; mais, I ask you _fat place_ de come from.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are thought to be gathered on the shores o' the Pacific,\" said\r\nJoe; \"the Injuns on the west o' the Rocky Mountains picks them up and\r\nexchanges them wi' the fellows here-away for horses and skins--so I'm\r\ntold.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a wild cry of terror heard a short distance\r\nahead of them.  Rushing forward they observed an Indian woman flying\r\nfrantically down the river's bank towards the waterfall, a hundred yards\r\nabove which an object was seen struggling in the water.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis her child,\" cried Joe, as the mother's frantic cry reached his\r\near.  \"It'll be over the fall in a minute!  Run, Dick, you're quickest.\"\r\n\r\nThey had all started forward at speed, but Dick and Crusoe were far\r\nahead, and abreast of the spot in a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\"Save it, pup,\" cried Dick, pointing to the child, which had been caught\r\nin an eddy, and was for a few moments hovering on the edge of the stream\r\nthat rushed impetuously towards the fall.\r\n\r\nThe noble Newfoundland did not require to be told what to do.  It seems\r\na natural instinct in this sagacious species of dog to save man or beast\r\nthat chances to be struggling in the water, and many are the authentic\r\nstories related of Newfoundland dogs saving life in cases of shipwreck.\r\nIndeed, they are regularly trained to the work in some countries, and\r\nnobly, fearlessly, disinterestedly, do they discharge their trust, often\r\nin the midst of appalling dangers.  Crusoe sprang from the bank with\r\nsuch impetus that his broad chest ploughed up the water like the bow of\r\na boat, and the energetic workings of his muscles were indicated by the\r\nforce of each successive propulsion as he shot ahead.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds he reached the child and caught it by the hair.  Then\r\nhe turned to swim back, but the stream had got hold of him.  Bravely he\r\nstruggled, and lifted the child breast-high out of the water in his\r\npowerful efforts to stem the current.  In vain.  Each moment he was\r\ncarried inch by inch down until he was on the brink of the fall, which,\r\nthough not high, was a large body of water and fell with a heavy roar.\r\nHe raised himself high out of the stream with the vigour of his last\r\nstruggle, and then fell back into the abyss.\r\n\r\nBy this time the poor mother was in a canoe as close to the fall as she\r\ncould with safety approach, and the little bark danced like a\r\ncockle-shell on the turmoil of waters as she stood with uplifted paddle\r\nand staring eyeballs awaiting the rising of the child.\r\n\r\nCrusoe came up almost instantly, but _alone_, for the dash over the fall\r\nhad wrenched the child from his teeth.  He raised himself high up and\r\nlooked anxiously round for a moment.  Then he caught sight of a little\r\nhand raised above the boiling flood.  In one moment he had the child\r\nagain by the hair, and, just as the prow of the Indian woman's canoe\r\ntouched the shore, he brought the child to land.\r\n\r\nSpringing towards him, the mother snatched her child from the flood and\r\ngazed at its death-like face with eyeballs starting from their sockets;\r\nthen she laid her cheek on its cold breast and stood like a statue of\r\ndespair.  There was one slight pulsation of the heart and a gentle\r\nmotion of the hand!  The child still lived.  Opening up her blanket she\r\nlaid her little one against her naked, warm bosom, drew the covering\r\nclose around it, and, sitting down on the bank, wept aloud for joy.\r\n\r\n\"Come,--come 'way quick,\" cried Henri, hurrying off to hide the emotion\r\nwhich he could not crush down.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, she don't need our help now,\" said Joe, following his comrade.\r\n\r\nAs for Crusoe, he walked along by his master's side with his usual\r\nquiet, serene look of good-will towards all mankind.  Doubtless a\r\nfeeling of gladness at having saved a human life filled his shaggy\r\nbreast, for he wagged his tail gently, after each shake of his dripping\r\nsides, but his meek eyes were downcast, save when raised to receive the\r\nwelcome and unusually fervent caress.  Crusoe did not know that those\r\nthree men loved him as though he had been a brother.\r\n\r\nOn their way back to the village the hunters were met by a little boy,\r\nwho said that a council was to be held immediately, and their presence\r\nwas requested.\r\n\r\nThe council was held in the tent of the principal chief, towards which\r\nall the other chiefs and many of the noted braves hurried.  Like all\r\nIndian councils, it was preceded by smoking the \"medicine pipe,\" and was\r\nfollowed by speeches from several of the best orators.  The substance of\r\nthe discourse differed little from what has been already related in\r\nreference to the treaty between the Pale-faces, and upon the whole it\r\nwas satisfactory.  But Joe Blunt could not fail to notice that Mahtawa\r\nmaintained sullen silence during the whole course of the meeting.\r\n\r\nHe observed, also, that there was a considerable change in the tone of\r\nthe meeting when he informed them that he was bound on a similar errand\r\nof peace to several of the other tribes, especially to one or two tribes\r\nwhich were the Pawnees' bitter enemies at that time.  These grasping\r\nsavages having quite made up their minds that they were to obtain the\r\nentire contents of the two bales of goods, were much mortified on\r\nhearing that part was to go to other Indian tribes.  Some of them even\r\nhinted that this would not be allowed, and Joe feared at one time that\r\nthings were going to take an unfavourable turn.  The hair of his scalp,\r\nas he afterwards said, \"began to lift a little and feel oneasy.\"  But\r\nSan-it-sa-rish stood honestly to his word; said that it would be well\r\nthat the Pale-faces and the Pawnees should be brothers, and hoped that\r\nthey would not forget the promise of annual presents from the hand of\r\nthe great chief who lived in the big village near the rising sun.\r\n\r\nHaving settled this matter amicably, Joe distributed among the Indians\r\nthe proportion of his goods designed for them, and then they all\r\nadjourned to another tent where a great feast was prepared for them.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye hungry?\" inquired Joe of Dick as they walked along.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that am I.  I feel as if I could eat a buffalo alive.  Why, it's my\r\n'pinion we've tasted nothin' since daybreak this mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've often told ye that them Red-skins think it a disgrace to\r\ngive in eatin' till all that's set before them at a feast is bolted.\r\nWe'll ha' to stretch oursel's, we will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'se got a plenty room,\" remarked Henri.\r\n\r\n\"Ye have, but ye'll wish ye had more in a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bien, I not care!\"\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour all the guests invited to this great _medicine_\r\nfeast were assembled.  No women were admitted.  They never are at Indian\r\nfeasts.\r\n\r\nWe may remark in passing, that the word \"medicine,\" as used among the\r\nNorth American Indians, has a very much wider signification than it has\r\nwith us.  It is an almost inexplicable word.  When asked, they cannot\r\ngive a full or satisfactory explanation of it themselves.  In the\r\ngeneral, we may say that whatever is mysterious is \"medicine.\"  Jugglery\r\nand conjuring, of a noisy, mysterious, and, we must add, rather silly\r\nnature, is \"medicine,\" and the juggler is a \"medicine-man.\"  These\r\nmedicine-men undertake cures, but they are regular charlatans, and know\r\nnothing whatever of the diseases they pretend to cure, or their\r\nremedies.  They carry bags containing sundry relics; these are \"medicine\r\nbags.\"  Every brave has his own private medicine bag.  Everything that\r\nis incomprehensible, or supposed to be supernatural, religious, or\r\nmedical, is \"medicine.\"  This feast, being an unusual one, in honour of\r\nstrangers, and in connection with a peculiar and unexpected event, was\r\n\"medicine.\"  Even Crusoe, since his gallant conduct in saving the Indian\r\nchild, was \"medicine\"; and Dick Varley's double-barrelled rifle, which\r\nhad been an object of wonder ever since his arrival at the village, was\r\ntremendous \"medicine!\"\r\n\r\nOf course the Indians were arrayed in their best; several wore necklaces\r\nof the claws of the grizzly bear, of which they are extremely proud; and\r\na gaudily picturesque group they were.  The chief, however, had\r\nundergone a transformation that well-nigh upset the gravity of our\r\nhunters, and rendered Dick's efforts to look solemn quite abortive.\r\nSan-it-sa-rish had once been to the trading forts of the Pale-faces, and\r\nwhile there had received the customary gift of a blue surtout with brass\r\nbuttons, and an ordinary hat, such as gentlemen wear at home.  As the\r\ncoat was a good deal too small for him, a terrible length of dark, bony\r\nwrist appeared below the cuffs.  The waist was too high, and it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that he managed to button the garment across his broad\r\nchest.  Being ignorant of the nature of a hat, the worthy savage had\r\nallowed the paper and string with which it had been originally covered,\r\nto remain on, supposing them to be part and parcel of the hat; and this,\r\ntogether with the high collar of the coat, which gave him a crushed-up\r\nappearance, the long black naked legs, and the painted visage, gave to\r\nhim a _tout ensemble_ which we can compare to nothing, as there was\r\nnothing in nature comparable to it.\r\n\r\nThose guests who assembled first passed their time in smoking the\r\nmedicine pipe until the others should arrive; for so long as a single\r\ninvited guest is absent the feast cannot begin.  Dignified silence was\r\nmaintained while the pipe thus circulated from hand to hand.  When the\r\nlast guest arrived they began.\r\n\r\nThe men were seated in two rows, face to face.  Feasts of this kind\r\nusually consist of but one species of food, and on the present occasion\r\nit was an enormous cauldron full of maize which had to be devoured.\r\nAbout fifty sat down to eat a quantity of what may be termed thick\r\nporridge, that would have been ample allowance for a hundred ordinary\r\nmen.  Before commencing, San-it-sa-rish desired an aged medicine-man to\r\nmake an oration, which he did fluently and poetically.  Its subject was\r\nthe praise of the giver of the feast.  At the end of each period there\r\nwas a general \"Hou! hou!\" of assent--equivalent to the hear! hear! of\r\ncivilised men.\r\n\r\nOther orators then followed, all of whom spoke with great ease and\r\nfluency, and some in the most impassioned strains, working themselves\r\nand their audience up to the highest pitch of excitement, now shouting\r\nwith frenzied violence till their eyes glared from their sockets, and\r\nthe veins of their foreheads swelled almost to bursting as they spoke of\r\nwar and chase--anon breaking into soft modulated and pleasing tones,\r\nwhile they dilated upon the pleasures of peace and hospitality.\r\n\r\nAfter these had finished, a number of wooden bowls full of maize\r\nporridge were put down between the guests--one bowl to each couple\r\nfacing each other.  But before commencing, a portion was laid aside and\r\ndedicated to their gods, with various mysterious ceremonies; for here,\r\nas in other places where the gospel is not known, the poor savages\r\nfancied that they could propitiate God with sacrifices.  They had never\r\nheard of the \"sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite heart.\"  This\r\noffering being made, the feast began in earnest.  Not only was it a rule\r\nin this feast that every mouthful should be swallowed by each guest,\r\nhowever unwilling and unable he should be to do so, but he who could\r\ndispose of it with greatest speed was deemed the greatest man--at least\r\non that occasion--while the last to conclude his supper was looked upon\r\nwith some degree of contempt!\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that such a custom should ever have arisen, and one is\r\nnot a little puzzled in endeavouring to guess at the origin of it.\r\nThere is one fact that occurs to us as the probable cause.  The Indian\r\nis, as we have before hinted, frequently reduced to a state bordering on\r\nstarvation, and in a day after he may be burdened with superabundance of\r\nfood.  He oftentimes, therefore, eats as much as he can stuff into his\r\nbody when he is blessed with plenty, so as to be the better able to\r\nwithstand the attacks of hunger that may possibly be in store for him.\r\nThe amount that an Indian will thus eat at a single meal is incredible.\r\nHe seems to have the power of distending himself for the reception of a\r\nquantity that would kill a civilised man.  Children, in particular,\r\nbecome like tightly inflated little balloons after a feast, and as they\r\nwear no clothing, the extraordinary rotundity is very obvious, not to\r\nsay ridiculous.  We conclude, therefore, that unusual powers of\r\ngormandising, being useful, come at last to be cultivated as\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune Dick and Joe Blunt happened to have such enormous\r\ngluttons as _vis-a-vis_, that the portions of their respective bowls\r\nwhich they could not devour were gobbled up for them.  By good capacity\r\nand digestion, with no small amount of effort, Henri managed to dispose\r\nof his own share; but he was last of being done, and fell in the\r\nsavages' esteem greatly.  The way in which that sticky compost of boiled\r\nmaize went down was absolutely amazing.  The man opposite Dick, in\r\nparticular, was a human boa-constrictor.  He well-nigh suffocated Dick\r\nwith suppressed laughter.  He was a great raw-boned savage, with a\r\nthroat of indiarubber, and went quickly and quietly on swallowing mass\r\nafter mass, with the solemn gravity of an owl.  It mattered not a straw\r\nto him that Dick took comparatively small mouthfuls, and nearly choked\r\non them too for want of liquid to wash them down.  Had Dick eaten none\r\nat all he would have uncomplainingly disposed of the whole.  Jack the\r\nGiant-Killer's feats were nothing to his, and when at last the bowl was\r\nempty, he stopped short like a machine from which the steam had been\r\nsuddenly cut off, and laid down his buffalo horn spoon _without_ a sigh.\r\n\r\nDick sighed, though, with relief and gratitude when his bowl was empty.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I may never have to do it again,\" said Joe that night as they\r\nwended their way back to the chief's tent after supper.  \"I wouldn't be\r\nfit for anything for a week arter it.\"\r\n\r\nDick could only laugh, for any allusion to the feast instantly brought\r\nback that owl-like gourmand to whom he was so deeply indebted.\r\n\r\nHenri groaned.  \"Oh! mes boy, I am speechless!  I am ready for bust!\r\nOui,--hah!  I veesh it vas to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nMany a time that night did Henri \"veesh it vas to-morrow,\" as he lay\r\nhelpless on his back, looking up through the roof of the chief's tent at\r\nthe stars, and listening enviously to the plethoric snoring of Joe\r\nBlunt.\r\n\r\nHe was entertained, however, during those waking hours with a serenade\r\nsuch as few civilised ears ever listen to.  This was nothing else than a\r\nvocal concert performed by all the dogs of the village, and as they\r\namounted to nearly two thousand, the orchestra was a pretty full one.\r\n\r\nThese wretches howled as if they had all gone mad.  Yet there was\r\n\"method in their madness,\" for they congregated in a crowd before\r\nbeginning, and sat down on their haunches.  Then one, which seemed to be\r\nthe conductor, raised his snout to the sky, and uttered a long, low,\r\nmelancholy wail.  The others took it up by twos and threes, until the\r\nwhole pack had their noses pointing to the stars, and their throats\r\ndistended to the uttermost, while a prolonged yell filled the air.  Then\r\nit sank gradually, one or two (bad performers probably) making a yelping\r\nattempt to get it up again at the wrong time.  Again the conductor\r\nraised his nose, and out it came--full swing.  There was no vociferous\r\nbarking.  It was simple wolfish howling increased in fervour to an\r\nelectric yell, with slight barks running continuously through it like an\r\nobbligato accompaniment.\r\n\r\nWhen Crusoe first heard the unwonted sound he sprang to his feet,\r\nbristled up like a hyena, showed all his teeth, and bounded out of the\r\ntent blazing with indignation and astonishment.  When he found out what\r\nit was he returned quite sleek, and with a look of profound contempt on\r\nhis countenance as he resumed his place by his master's side and went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nPERPLEXITIES--OUR HUNTERS PLAN THEIR ESCAPE--UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION--\r\nTHE TABLES TURNED--CRUSOE MOUNTS GUARD--THE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nDick Varley sat before the fire ruminating.  We do not mean to assert\r\nthat Dick had been previously eating grass.  By no means.  For several\r\ndays past he had been mentally subsisting on the remarkable things that\r\nhe heard and saw in the Pawnee village, and wondering how he was to get\r\naway without being scalped; he was now chewing the cud of this\r\nintellectual fare.  We therefore repeat emphatically--in case any reader\r\nshould have presumed to contradict us--that Dick Varley sat before the\r\nfire _ruminating_!\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt likewise sat by the fire along with him, ruminating too, and\r\nsmoking besides.  Henri also sat there smoking, and looking a little the\r\nworse of his late supper.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like the look o' things,\" said Joe, blowing a whiff of smoke\r\nslowly from his lips, and watching it as it ascended into the still air.\r\n\"That blackguard Mahtawa is determined not to let us off till he gits\r\nall our goods, an' if he gits them, he may as well take our scalps too,\r\nfor we would come poor speed in the prairies without guns, horses, or\r\ngoods.\"\r\n\r\nDick looked at his friend with an expression of concern.  \"What's to be\r\ndone?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Ve must escape,\" answered Henri; but his tone was not a hopeful one,\r\nfor he knew the danger of their position better than Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, we must escape; at least we must try,\" said Joe; \"but I'll make one\r\nmore effort to smooth over San-it-sa-rish, an' git him to snub that\r\nvillain Mahtawa.\"\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke the villain in question entered the tent with a bold,\r\nhaughty air, and sat down before the fire in sullen silence.  For some\r\nminutes no one spoke, and Henri, who happened at the time to be\r\nexamining the locks of Dick's rifle, continued to inspect them with an\r\nappearance of careless indifference that he was far from feeling.\r\n\r\nNow, this rifle of Dick's had become a source of unceasing wonder to the\r\nIndians,--wonder which was greatly increased by the fact that no one\r\ncould discharge it but himself.  Dick had, during his short stay at the\r\nPawnee village, amused himself and the savages by exhibiting his\r\nmarvellous powers with the \"silver rifle.\"  Since it had been won by him\r\nat the memorable match in the Mustang Valley, it had scarce ever been\r\nout of his hand, so that he had become decidedly the best shot in the\r\nsettlement, could \"bark\" squirrels (that is, hit the bark of the branch\r\non which a squirrel happened to be standing, and so kill it by the\r\nconcussion alone), and could \"drive the nail\" every shot.  The silver\r\nrifle, as we have said, became \"great medicine\" to the Red-men, when\r\nthey saw it kill at a distance which the few wretched guns they had\r\nobtained from the fur-traders could not even send a spent ball to.  The\r\ndouble shot, too, filled them with wonder and admiration; but that which\r\nthey regarded with an almost supernatural feeling of curiosity was the\r\npercussion cap, which in Dick's hands always exploded, but in theirs was\r\nutterly useless!\r\n\r\nThis result was simply owing to the fact, that Dick after firing handed\r\nthe rifle to the Indians without renewing the cap.  So that when they\r\nloaded and attempted to fire, of course it merely snapped.  When he\r\nwished again to fire, he adroitly exchanged the old cap for a new one.\r\nHe was immensely tickled by the solemn looks of the Indians at this most\r\nincomprehensible of all \"medicines,\" and kept them for some days in\r\nignorance of the true cause, intending to reveal it before he left.  But\r\ncircumstances now arose which banished all trifling thoughts from his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nMahtawa raised his head suddenly, and said, pointing to the silver\r\nrifle, \"Mahtawa wishes to have the two-shotted medicine gun.  He will\r\ngive his best horse in exchange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mahtawa is liberal,\" answered Joe, \"but the pale-faced youth cannot\r\npart with it.  He has far to travel, and must shoot buffaloes by the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pale-faced youth shall have a bow and arrows to shoot the buffalo,\"\r\nrejoined the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"He cannot use the bow and arrow,\" answered Joe; \"he has not been\r\ntrained like the Red-man.\"\r\n\r\nMahtawa was silent for a few seconds, and his dark brows frowned more\r\nheavily than ever over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-faces are too bold,\" he exclaimed, working himself into a\r\npassion; \"they are in the power of Mahtawa.  If they will not give the\r\ngun he will take it.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang suddenly to his feet as he spoke, and snatched the rifle from\r\nHenri's hand.\r\n\r\nHenri, being ignorant of the language, had not been able to understand\r\nthe foregoing conversation, although he saw well enough that it was not\r\nan agreeable one but no sooner did he find himself thus rudely and\r\nunexpectedly deprived of the rifle, than he jumped up, wrenched it in a\r\ntwinkling from the Indian's grasp, and hurled him violently out of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mahtawa drew his knife, uttered a savage yell, and sprang on\r\nthe reckless hunter, who, however, caught his wrist, and held it as if\r\nin a vice.  The yell brought a dozen warriors instantly to the spot, and\r\nbefore Dick had time to recover from his astonishment, Henri was\r\nsurrounded and pinioned despite his herculean struggles.\r\n\r\nBefore Dick could move, Joe Blunt grasped his arm, and whispered\r\nquickly, \"Don't rise!  You can't help him!  They daren't kill him till\r\nSan-it-sa-rish agrees.\"\r\n\r\nThough much surprised, Dick obeyed, but it required all his efforts,\r\nboth of voice and hand, to control Crusoe, whose mind was much too\r\nhonest and straightforward to understand such subtle pieces of\r\ndiplomacy, and who strove to rush to the rescue of his ill-used friend.\r\n\r\nWhen the tumult had partly subsided, Joe Blunt rose and said--\"Have the\r\nPawnee braves turned traitors that they draw the knife against those who\r\nhave smoked with them the pipe of peace and eaten their maize?  The\r\nPale-faces are three; the Pawnees are thousands.  If evil has been done,\r\nlet it be laid before the chief.  Mahtawa wishes to have the medicine\r\ngun.  Although we said No, we could not part with it, he tried to take\r\nit by force.  Are we to go back to the great chief of the Pale-faces,\r\nand say that the Pawnees are thieves?  Are the Pale-faces henceforth to\r\ntell their children when they steal, `That is bad; that is like the\r\nPawnee?'  No! this must not be.  The rifle shall be restored, and we\r\nwill forget this disagreement.  Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an evident disposition on the part of many of the Indians,\r\nwith whom Mahtawa was no favourite, to applaud this speech; but the wily\r\nchief sprang forward, and, with flashing eye, sought to turn the tables.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-face speaks with soft words, but his heart is false.  Is he\r\nnot going to make peace with the enemies of the Pawnee?  Is he not going\r\nto take goods to them, and make them gifts and promises?  The Pale-faces\r\nare spies.  They come to see the weakness of the Pawnee camp, but they\r\nhave found that it is strong.  Shall we suffer the false-hearts to\r\nescape?  Shall they live?  No! we will hang their scalps in our wigwams,\r\nfor they have _struck a chief_ and we will keep all their goods for our\r\nsquaws--wah!\"\r\n\r\nThis allusion to keeping all the goods had more effect on the minds of\r\nthe vacillating savages than the chiefs eloquence.  But a new turn was\r\ngiven to their thoughts by Joe Blunt remarking in a quiet, almost\r\ncontemptuous tone--\r\n\r\n\"Mahtawa is not the _great_ chief.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" they cried, and immediately hurried to the tent of\r\nSan-it-sa-rish.\r\n\r\nOnce again this chief stood between the hunters and the savages, who\r\nwanted but a signal to fall on them.  There was a long palaver, which\r\nended in Henri being set at liberty, and the rifle being restored.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as the three friends sat beside their fire eating their\r\nsupper of boiled maize and buffalo meat, they laughed and talked as\r\ncarelessly as ever; but the gaiety was assumed, for they were at the\r\ntime planning their escape from a tribe which, they foresaw, would not\r\nlong refrain from carrying out their wishes, and robbing, perhaps\r\nmurdering them.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see,\" said Joe with a perplexed air, while he drew a piece of live\r\ncharcoal from the fire with his fingers and lighted his pipe,--\"ye see,\r\nthere's more difficulties in the way o' gettin' off than ye think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nivare mind de difficulties,\" interrupted Henri, whose wrath at the\r\ntreatment he had received had not yet cooled down.  \"Ve must jump on de\r\nbest horses ve can git hold, shake our fist at de red reptiles, and go\r\naway fast as ve can.  De best hoss _must_ vin de race.\"\r\n\r\nJoe shook his head.  \"A hundred arrows would be in our backs before we\r\ngot twenty yards from the camp.  Besides, we can't tell which are the\r\nbest horses.  Our own are the best in my 'pinion, but how are we to git\r\n'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know who has charge o' them,\" said Dick; \"I saw them grazing near the\r\ntent o' that poor squaw whose baby was saved by Crusoe.  Either her\r\nhusband looks after them or some neighbours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's well,\" said Joe.  \"That's one o' my difficulties gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, d'ye see, they're troublesome.  We can't git the horses out o'\r\ncamp without bein' seen, for the red rascals would see what we were at\r\nin a jiffy.  Then, if we do git 'em out, we can't go off without our\r\nbales, an' we needn't think to take 'em from under the nose o' the chief\r\nand his squaws without bein' axed questions.  To go off without them\r\nwould niver do at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joe,\" said Dick, earnestly, \"I've hit on a plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have ye, Dick? what is't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and I'll let ye see,\" answered Dick, rising hastily and quitting\r\nthe tent, followed by his comrades and his faithful dog.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to remark here, that no restraint whatever had yet\r\nbeen put on the movements of our hunters as long as they kept to their\r\nlegs, for it was well-known that any attempt by men on foot to escape\r\nfrom mounted Indians on the plains would be hopeless.  Moreover, the\r\nsavages thought that as long as there was a prospect of their being\r\nallowed to depart peaceably with their goods, they would not be so mad\r\nas to fly from the camp, and, by so doing, risk their lives and declare\r\nwar with their entertainers.  They had, therefore, been permitted to\r\nwander unchecked, as yet, far beyond the outskirts of the camp, and\r\namuse themselves in paddling about the lake in the small Indian canoes\r\nand shooting wild-fowl.\r\n\r\nDick now led the way through the labyrinths of tents in the direction of\r\nthe lake, and they talked and laughed loudly, and whistled to Crusoe as\r\nthey went, in order to prevent their purpose being suspected.  For the\r\npurpose of further disarming suspicion they went without their rifles.\r\nDick explained his plan by the way, and it was at once warmly approved\r\nof by his comrades.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the lake they launched a small canoe, into which Crusoe was\r\nordered to jump; then, embarking, they paddled swiftly to the opposite\r\nshore, singing a canoe song as they dipped their paddles in the moonlit\r\nwaters of the lake.  Arrived at the other side, they hauled the canoe up\r\nand hurried through the thin belt of wood and willows that intervened\r\nbetween the lake and the prairie.  Here they paused.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the bluff, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Dick, that's too near.  T'other one'll be best.  Far away to the\r\nright.  It's a little one, and there's others near it.  The sharp eyes\r\no' the Red-skins won't be so likely to be prowlin' there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then; but we'll have to take down by the lake first.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the hunters were threading their way through the\r\noutskirts of the wood at a rapid trot, in the opposite direction from\r\nthe bluff, or wooded knoll, which they wished to reach.  This they did\r\nlest prying eyes should have followed them.  In a quarter of an hour\r\nthey turned at right angles to their track, and struck straight out into\r\nthe prairie, and after a long run they edged round and came in upon the\r\nbluff from behind.  It was merely a collection of stunted but\r\nthick-growing willows.\r\n\r\nForcing their way into the centre of this they began to examine it.\r\n\r\n\"It'll do,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"De very ting,\" remarked Henri.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe bounded to his master's side, and looked up in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this place, pup; smell it well.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe instantly set off all round among the willows, in and out,\r\nsnuffing everywhere, and whining with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, good pup; that will do.  Now, lads, we'll go back.\"  So\r\nsaying, Dick and his friends left the bluff and retraced their steps to\r\nthe camp.  Before they had gone far, however, Joe halted, and said--\r\n\r\n\"D'ye know, Dick, I doubt if the pup's so cliver as ye think.  What if\r\nhe don't quite onderstand ye?\"\r\n\r\nDick replied by taking off his cap and throwing it down, at the same\r\ntime exclaiming, \"Take it yonder, pup,\" and pointing with his hand\r\ntowards the bluff.  The dog seized the cap, and went off with it at full\r\nspeed towards the willows, where it left it, and came galloping back for\r\nthe expected reward--not now, as in days of old, a bit of meat, but a\r\ngentle stroke of its head and a hearty clap on its shaggy side.\r\n\r\n\"Good pup, go now an' _fetch it_.\"\r\n\r\nAway he went with a bound, and, in a few seconds, came back and\r\ndeposited the cap at his master's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Will that do?\" asked Dick, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, lad, it will.  The pup's worth its weight in goold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, I have said, and I say it agen, de dog is _human_, so him is.  If\r\nnot--fat am he?\"\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to reply to this perplexing question, Dick stepped\r\nforward again, and in half an hour or so they were back in the camp.\r\n\r\n\"Now for _your_ part of the work, Joe; yonder's the squaw that owns the\r\nhalf-drowned baby.  Everything depends on her.\"\r\n\r\nDick pointed to the Indian woman as he spoke.  She was sitting beside\r\nher tent, and playing at her knee was the identical youngster that had\r\nbeen saved by Crusoe.\r\n\r\n\"I'll manage it,\" said Joe, and walked towards her, while Dick and Henri\r\nreturned to the chiefs tent.\r\n\r\n\"Does the Pawnee woman thank the Great Spirit that her child is saved?\"\r\nbegan Joe as he came up.\r\n\r\n\"She does,\" answered the woman, looking up at the hunter.  \"And her\r\nheart is warm to the Pale-faces.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence Joe continued--\r\n\r\n\"The Pawnee chiefs do not love the Pale-faces.  Some of them hate them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dark Flower knows it,\" answered the woman; \"she is sorry.  She\r\nwould help the Pale-faces if she could.\"\r\n\r\nThis was uttered in a low tone, and with a meaning glance of the eye.\r\n\r\nJoe hesitated again--could he trust her?  Yes; the feelings that filled\r\nher breast and prompted her words were not those of the Indian just\r\nnow--they were those of a _mother_, whose gratitude was too full for\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n\"Will the Dark Flower,\" said Joe, catching the name she had given\r\nherself, \"help the Pale-face if he opens his heart to her?  Will she\r\nrisk the anger of her nation?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will,\" replied the woman; \"she will do what she can.\"\r\n\r\nJoe and his dark friend now dropped their high-sounding style of speech,\r\nand spoke for some minutes rapidly in an undertone.  It was finally\r\narranged that on a given day, at a certain hour, the woman should take\r\nthe four horses down the shores of the lake to its lower end, as if she\r\nwere going for firewood, there cross the creek at the ford, and drive\r\nthem to the willow-bluff, and guard them till the hunters should arrive.\r\n\r\nHaving settled this, Joe returned to the tent and informed his comrades\r\nof his success.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three days Joe kept the Indians in good-humour by giving\r\nthem one or two trinkets, and speaking in glowing terms of the riches of\r\nthe white men, and the readiness with which they would part with them to\r\nthe savages if they would only make peace.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during the dark hours of each night, Dick managed to abstract\r\nsmall quantities of goods from their pack, in room of which he stuffed\r\nin pieces of leather to keep up the size and appearance.  The goods thus\r\ntaken out he concealed about his person, and went off with a careless\r\nswagger to the outskirts of the village, with Crusoe at his heels.\r\nArrived there, he tied the goods in a small piece of deerskin, and gave\r\nthe bundle to the dog, with the injunction, \"Take it yonder, pup.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe took it up at once, darted off at full speed with the bundle in\r\nhis mouth, down the shore of the lake towards the ford of the river, and\r\nwas soon lost to view.  In this way, little by little, the goods were\r\nconveyed by the faithful dog to the willow-bluff and left there, while\r\nthe stuffed pack still remained in safekeeping in the chief's tent.\r\n\r\nJoe did not at first like the idea of thus sneaking off from the camp;\r\nand more than once made strong efforts to induce San-it-sa-rish to let\r\nhim go, but even that chief's countenance was not so favourable as it\r\nhad been.  It was clear that he could not make up his mind to let slip\r\nso good a chance of obtaining guns, powder, and shot, horses and goods,\r\nwithout any trouble; so Joe made up his mind to give them the slip at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nA dark night was chosen for the attempt, and the Indian woman went off\r\nwith the horses to the place where firewood for the camp was usually\r\ncut.  Unfortunately the suspicion of that wily savage Mahtawa had been\r\nawakened, and he stuck close to the hunters all day--not knowing what\r\nwas going on, but feeling convinced that something was brewing which he\r\nresolved to watch, without mentioning his suspicions to any one.\r\n\r\n\"I think that villain's away at last,\" whispered Joe to his comrades;\r\n\"it's time to go, lads, the moon won't be up for an hour.  Come along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have ye got the big powder-horn, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop! stop! my knife, my couteau.  Ah! here it be.  Now, boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe three set off as usual, strolling carelessly to the outskirts of the\r\ncamp; then they quickened their pace, and, gaining the lake, pushed off\r\nin a small canoe.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mahtawa stepped from the bushes, leaped into another\r\ncanoe and followed them.\r\n\r\n\"Hah! he must die,\" muttered Henri.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Joe, \"we'll manage him without that.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief landed and strode boldly up to them, for he knew well that\r\nwhatever their purpose might be, they would not venture to use their\r\nrifles within sound of the camp at that hour of the night; as for their\r\nknives, he could trust to his own active limbs and the woods to escape\r\nand give the alarm if need be.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-faces hunt very late,\" he said with a malicious grin.  \"Do\r\nthey love the dark better than the sunshine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" replied Joe, coolly, \"but we love to walk by the light of the\r\nmoon.  It will be up in less than an hour, and we mean to take a long\r\nramble to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Pawnee chief loves to walk by the moon too, he will go with the\r\nPale-faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" ejaculated Joe.  \"Come along, then.\"\r\n\r\nThe party immediately set forward, although the savage was a little\r\ntaken by surprise at the indifferent way in which Joe received his\r\nproposal to accompany them.  He walked on to the edge of the prairie,\r\nhowever, and then stopped.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-faces must go alone,\" said he; \"Mahtawa will return to his\r\ntent.\"\r\n\r\nJoe replied to this intimation by seizing him suddenly by the throat and\r\nchoking back the yell that would otherwise have brought the Pawnee\r\nwarriors rushing to the scene of action in hundreds.  Mahtawa's hand was\r\non the handle of his scalping-knife in a moment, but before he could\r\ndraw it, his arms were glued to his sides by the bear-like embrace of\r\nHenri, while Dick tied a handkerchief quickly yet firmly round his\r\nmouth.  The whole thing was accomplished in two minutes.  After taking\r\nhis knife and tomahawk away, they loosened their gripe and escorted him\r\nswiftly over the prairie.\r\n\r\nMahtawa was perfectly submissive after the first convulsive struggle was\r\nover.  He knew that the men who walked on each side of him grasping his\r\narms were more than his match singly, so he wisely made no resistance.\r\n\r\nHurrying him to a clump of small trees on the plain which was so far\r\ndistant from the village that a yell could not be heard, they removed\r\nthe bandage from Mahtawa's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"_Must_ he be kill?\" inquired Henri, in a tone of commiseration.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all\" answered Joe, \"we'll tie him to a tree and leave him\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he vill be starve to deat'.  Oh! dat is more horrobell!\"\r\n\r\n\"He must take his chance o' that.  I've no doubt his friends'll find him\r\nin a day or two, an' he's game to last for a week or more.  But you'll\r\nhave to run to the willow-bluff, Dick, and bring a bit of line to tie\r\nhim.  We can't spare it well; but there's no help.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there _is_ help,\" retorted Dick.  \"Just order the villain to climb\r\ninto that tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask questions, but do what I bid ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter smiled for a moment as he turned to the Indian, and ordered\r\nhim to climb up a small tree near to which he stood.  Mahtawa looked\r\nsurprised, but there was no alternative.  Joe's authoritative tone\r\nbrooked no delay, so he sprang into the tree like a monkey.\r\n\r\n\"Crusoe,\" said Dick, \"_watch him_!\"\r\n\r\nThe dog sat quietly down at the foot of the tree, and fixed his eyes on\r\nthe savage with a glare that spoke unutterable things.  At the same time\r\nhe displayed his full compliment of teeth, and uttered a sound like\r\ndistant thunder.\r\n\r\nJoe almost laughed, and Henri did laugh outright.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, he's safe now,\" cried Dick, hurrying away in the direction\r\nof the willow-bluff, which they soon reached, and found that the\r\nfaithful squaw had tied their steeds to the bushes, and, moreover, had\r\nbundled up their goods into a pack, and strapped it on the back of the\r\npack-horse; but she had not remained with them.\r\n\r\n\"Bless yer dark face,\" ejaculated Joe as he sprang into the saddle and\r\nrode out of the clump of bushes.  He was followed immediately by the\r\nothers, and in three minutes they were flying over the plain at full\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the last far-off ridge, that afforded a distant view of the\r\nwoods skirting the Pawnee camp, they drew up, and Dick, putting his\r\nfingers to his mouth, drew a long, shrill whistle.\r\n\r\nIt reached the willow-bluff like a faint echo.  At the same moment the\r\nmoon arose and more clearly revealed Crusoe's catalyptic glare at the\r\nIndian chief, who, being utterly unarmed, was at the dog's mercy.  The\r\ninstant the whistle fell on his ear, however, he dropped his eyes,\r\ncovered his teeth, and, leaping through the bushes, flew over the plains\r\nlike an arrow.  At the same instant Mahtawa, descending from his tree,\r\nran as fast as he could towards the village, uttering the terrible\r\nwar-whoop when near enough to be heard.  No sound sends such a thrill\r\nthrough an Indian camp.  Every warrior flew to arms, and vaulted on his\r\nsteed.  So quickly was the alarm given that in less than ten minutes a\r\nthousand hoofs were thundering on the plain, and faintly reached the\r\nears of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nJoe smiled.  \"It'll puzzle them to come up wi' nags like ours.  They're\r\nin prime condition too, lots o' wind in 'em.  If we only keep out o'\r\nbadger holes we may laugh at the red varmints.\"\r\n\r\nJoe's opinion of Indian horses was correct.  In a very few minutes the\r\nsound of hoofs died away, but the fugitives did not draw bridle during\r\nthe remainder of that night, for they knew not how long the pursuit\r\nmight be continued.  By pond, and brook, and bluff they passed, down in\r\nthe grassy bottoms and over the prairie waves,--nor checked their\r\nheadlong course till the sun blazed over the level sweep of the eastern\r\nplain as if it arose out of the mighty ocean.\r\n\r\nThen they sprang from the saddle and hastily set about the preparation\r\nof their morning meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nEVENING MEDITATIONS AND MORNING REFLECTIONS--BUFFALOES, BADGERS,\r\nANTELOPES, AND ACCIDENTS--AN OLD BULL AND THE WOLVES--\"MAD-TAILS\"--HENRI\r\nFLOORED, ETCETERA.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that prepares one so well for the enjoyment of rest,\r\nboth mental and physical, as a long-protracted period of excitement and\r\nanxiety, followed up by bodily fatigue.  Excitement alone banishes rest;\r\nbut, united with severe physical exertion, it prepares for it.  At\r\nleast, courteous reader, this is our experience, and certainly this was\r\nthe experience of our three hunters as they lay on their backs beneath\r\nthe branches of a willow bush, and gazed serenely up at the twinkling\r\nstars, two days after their escape from the Indian village.\r\n\r\nThey spoke little; they were too tired for that; also, they were too\r\ncomfortable.  Their respective suppers of fresh antelope steak, shot\r\nthat day, had just been disposed of; their feet were directed towards\r\nthe small fire on which the said steaks had been cooked, and which still\r\nthrew a warm, ruddy glow over the encampment.  Their blankets were\r\nwrapped comfortably round them, and tucked in as only hunters and\r\nmothers know _how_ to tuck them in.  Their respective pipes delivered\r\nforth, at stated intervals, three richly yellow puffs of smoke, as if a\r\nthree-gun battery were playing upon the sky from that particular spot of\r\nearth.  The horses were picketted and hobbled in a rich grassy bottom\r\nclose by, from which the quiet munch of their equine jaws sounded\r\npleasantly, for it told of healthy appetites, and promised speed on the\r\nmorrow.  The fear of being overtaken during the night was now past, and\r\nthe faithful Crusoe, by virtue of sight, hearing, and smell, guaranteed\r\nthem against sudden attack during the hours of slumber.  A perfume of\r\nwild flowers mingled with the loved odours of the \"weed,\" and the tinkle\r\nof a tiny rivulet fell sweetly on their ears.  In short, the\r\n\"Pale-faces\" were supremely happy, and disposed to be thankful for their\r\nrecent deliverance and their present comforts.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the stars are,\" said Dick, languidly taking the pipe out\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Bits o' fire,\" suggested Joe.\r\n\r\n\"I tink dey are vorlds,\" muttered Henri, \"an' have peepels in dem.  I\r\nhave hear men say dat.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence followed, during which, no doubt, the star-gazers were\r\nworking out various theories in their own minds.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder,\" said Dick again, \"how far off they be.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mile or two, maybe,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\nHenri was about to laugh sarcastically at this; but, on further\r\nconsideration, he thought it would be more comfortable not to, so he lay\r\nstill.  In another minute he said--\"Joe Blunt, you is ver' igrant.\r\nDon't you know dat de books say de stars be hondreds, tousands,--oh!\r\nmilleryons of mile away to here, and dat de is more bigger dan dis\r\nvorld?\"\r\n\r\nJoe snored lightly, and his pipe fell out of his mouth at this point, so\r\nthe conversation dropped.  Presently Dick asked, in a low tone, \"I say,\r\nHenri, are ye asleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui,\" replied Henri, faintly.  \"Don't speak, or you vill vaken me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Crusoe, you're not asleep, are you, pup?\"  No need to ask that\r\nquestion.  The instantaneous wag of that speaking fail, and the glance\r\nof that wakeful eye, as the dog lifted his head and laid his chin on\r\nDick's arm, showed that he had been listening to every word that was\r\nspoken.  We cannot say whether he understood it, but beyond all doubt he\r\nheard it.  Crusoe never presumed to think of going to sleep until his\r\nmaster was as sound as a top; then he ventured to indulge in that light\r\nspecies of slumber which is familiarly known as \"sleeping with one eye\r\nopen.\"  But, comparatively, as well as figuratively speaking, Crusoe\r\nslept usually with one eye and a-half open, and the other half was never\r\nvery tightly shut.\r\n\r\nGradually Dick's pipe fell out of his mouth, an event which the dog,\r\nwith an exercise of instinct almost, if not quite, amounting to reason,\r\nregarded as a signal for him to go off.  The campfire went slowly out,\r\nthe stars twinkled down at their reflections in the brook, and a deep\r\nbreathing of wearied men was the only sound that rose in harmony with\r\nthe purling stream.\r\n\r\nBefore the sun rose next morning, and while many of the brighter stars\r\nwere still struggling for existence with the approaching day, Joe was up\r\nand buckling on the saddle-bags, while he shouted to his unwilling\r\ncompanions to rise.\r\n\r\n\"If it depended on you,\" he said, \"the Pawnees wouldn't be long afore\r\nthey got our scalps.  Jump, ye dogs, an' lend a hand, will ye!\"\r\n\r\nA snore from Dick and a deep sigh from Henri was the answer to this\r\npathetic appeal.  It so happened, however, that Henri's pipe, in falling\r\nfrom his lips, had emptied the ashes just under his nose, so that the\r\nsigh referred to drew a quantity thereof into his throat, and almost\r\nchoked him.  Nothing could have been a more effective awakener.  He was\r\nup in a moment coughing vociferously.  Most men have a tendency to vent\r\nill-humour on some one, and they generally do it on one whom they deem\r\nto be worse than themselves.  Henri, therefore, instead of growling at\r\nJoe for rousing him, scolded Dick for not rising.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, mauvais dog! bad chien, vill you dare to look to me?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe did look with amiable placidity, as though to say, \"Howl away,\r\nold boy, I won't budge till Dick does.\"\r\n\r\nWith a mighty effort Giant Sleep was thrown off at last, and the hunters\r\nwere once more on their journey, cantering lightly over the soft turf.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! let's have a run,\" cried Dick, unable to repress the feelings\r\naroused by the exhilarating morning air.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, boy,\" cried Joe, as they stretched out at full gallop.\r\n\"Keep off the ridge; it's riddled wi' badger--Hah!  I thought so.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dick's horse put its foot into a badger hole, and turned\r\ncompletely over, sending its rider through the air in a curve that an\r\nEast Indian acrobat would have envied.  For a few seconds Dick lay flat\r\non his back; then he jumped up and laughed, while his comrades hurried\r\nup anxiously to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\"No bones broke?\" inquired Joe.\r\n\r\nDick gave a hysterical gasp.  \"I--I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a look.  No, nothin' to speak o', be good luck.  Ye should\r\nniver go slap through a badger country like that, boy; always keep i'\r\nthe bottoms, where the grass is short.  Now then, up ye go.  That's it!\"\r\n\r\nDick remounted, though not with quite so elastic a spring as usual, and\r\nthey pushed forward at a more reasonable pace.\r\n\r\nAccidents of this kind are of common occurrence in the prairies.  Some\r\nhorses, however, are so well trained that they look sharp out for these\r\nholes, which are generally found to be most numerous on the high and dry\r\ngrounds.  But in spite of all the caution both of man and horse, many\r\nugly falls take place, and sometimes bones are broken.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far after this accident, when an antelope leaped from\r\na clump of willows and made for a belt of woodland that lay along the\r\nmargin of a stream not half a mile off.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Dick, forgetting his recent fall.  \"Come along, Crusoe.\"\r\nAnd away they went again full tilt, for the horse had not been injured\r\nby its somersault.\r\n\r\nThe antelope which Dick was thus wildly pursuing was of the same species\r\nas the one he had shot some time before, namely, the prong-horned\r\nantelope.  These graceful creatures have long, slender limbs, delicately\r\nformed heads, and large, beautiful eyes.  The horns are black, and\r\nrather short; they have no branches like the antlers of the red-deer,\r\nbut have a single projection on each horn, near the head, and the\r\nextreme points of the horns curve suddenly inwards, forming the hook or\r\nprong from which the name of the animal is derived.  Their colour is\r\ndark yellowish brown.  They are so fleet that not one horse in a hundred\r\ncan overtake them, and their sight and sense of smell are so acute, that\r\nit would be next to impossible to kill them, were it not for the\r\ninordinate curiosity which we have before referred to.  The Indians\r\nmanage to attract these simple little creatures by merely lying down on\r\ntheir backs and kicking their heels in the air, or by waving any white\r\nobject on the point of an arrow, while the hunter keeps concealed by\r\nlying flat in the grass.  By these means a herd of antelopes may be\r\ninduced to wheel round and round an object in timid, but intense,\r\nsurprise, gradually approaching until they come near enough to enable\r\nthe hunter to make sure of his mark.  Thus the animals, which of all\r\nothers _ought_ to be the most difficult to slay, are, in consequence of\r\ntheir insatiable curiosity, more easily shot than any other deer of the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nMay we not gently suggest to the reader for his or her consideration\r\nthat there are human antelopes, so to speak, whose case bears a striking\r\nresemblance to the prong-horn of the North American prairie?\r\n\r\nDick's horse was no match for the antelope; neither was Crusoe, so they\r\npulled up shortly and returned to their companions to be laughed at.\r\n\r\n\"It's no manner o' use to wind yer horse, lad, after sich game.  They're\r\nnot much worth, an', if I mistake not, we'll be among the buffalo soon.\r\nThere's fresh tracks everywhere, and the herds are scattered now.  Ye\r\nsee, when they keep together in bands o' thousands ye don't so often\r\nfall in wi' them.  But when they scatters about in twos, an' threes, an\r\nsixes, ye may shoot them every day as much as ye please.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral groups of buffalo had already been seen on the horizon; but as a\r\nred-deer had been shot in a belt of woodland the day before, they did\r\nnot pursue them.  The red-deer is very much larger than the prong-horned\r\nantelope, and is highly esteemed both for its flesh and its skin, which\r\nlatter becomes almost like chamois leather when dressed.\r\nNotwithstanding this supply of food, the hunters could not resist the\r\ntemptation to give chase to a herd of about nine buffaloes that suddenly\r\ncame into view as they overtopped an undulation in the plain.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" cried Dick, \"I _must_ go at them!\"\r\n\r\nJoe himself caught fire from the spirit of his young friend, so calling\r\nto Henri to come on and let the pack-horse remain to feed, he dashed\r\naway in pursuit.  The buffaloes gave one stare of surprise, and then\r\nfled as fast as possible.  At first it seemed as if such huge, unwieldy\r\ncarcases could not run very fast; but in a few minutes they managed to\r\nget up a pace that put the horses to their mettle.  Indeed, at first it\r\nseemed as if the hunters did not gain an inch, but by degrees they\r\nclosed with them, for buffaloes are not long-winded.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the herd, the three men diverged from each other and selected\r\ntheir animals.  Henri, being short-sighted, naturally singled out the\r\nlargest; and the largest--also naturally,--was a tough old bull.  Joe\r\nbrought down a fat young cow at the first shot, and Dick was equally\r\nfortunate.  But he well-nigh shot Crusoe, who, just as he was about to\r\nfire, rushed in unexpectedly and sprang at the animal's throat, for\r\nwhich piece of recklessness he was ordered back to watch the pack-horse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Henri, by dint of yelling, throwing his arms wildly about,\r\nand digging his heels into the sides of his long-legged horse, succeeded\r\nin coming close up with the bull, which once or twice turned his clumsy\r\nbody half round and glared furiously at its pursuer with its small black\r\neyes.  Suddenly it stuck out its tail, stopped short, and turned full\r\nround.  Henri stopped short also.  Now, the sticking out of a buffalo's\r\ntail has a peculiar significance which it is well to point out.  It\r\nserves, in a sense, the same purpose to the hunter that the compass does\r\nto the mariner; it points out where to go and what to do.  When\r\ngalloping away in ordinary flight the buffalo carries his tail like\r\nordinary cattle, which indicates that you may push on.  When wounded, he\r\nlashes it from side to side, or carries it over his back, up in the air;\r\nthis indicates \"Look out! haul off a bit!\"  But when he carries it stiff\r\nand horizontal, with a _slight curve_ in the middle of it, it says\r\nplainly, \"Keep back, or kill me as quick as you can,\" for that is what\r\nIndians call the _mad-lazy_, and is a sign that mischief is brewing.\r\n\r\nHenri's bull displayed the mad-tail just before turning, but he didn't\r\nobserve it, and, accordingly, waited for the bull to move and show his\r\nshoulder for a favourable shot.  But instead of doing this he put his\r\nhead down, and, foaming with rage, went at him full tilt.  The big horse\r\nnever stirred; it seemed to be petrified.  Henri had just time to fire\r\nat the monster's neck, and the next moment was sprawling on his back,\r\nwith the horse rolling over four or five yards beyond him.  It was a\r\nmost effective tableau.  Henri rubbing his shins and grinning with pain,\r\nthe horse gazing in affright as he rose trembling from the plain, and\r\nthe buffalo bull looking on half stunned, and, evidently, very much\r\nsurprised at the result of his charge.\r\n\r\nFortunately, before he could repeat the experiment, Dick galloped up and\r\nput a ball through his heart.\r\n\r\nJoe and his comrades felt a little ashamed of their exploit on this\r\noccasion, for there was no need to have killed three animals; they could\r\nnot have carried with them more than a small portion of one, and they\r\nupbraided themselves several times during the operation of cutting out\r\nthe tongues and other choice portions of the two victims.  As for the\r\nbull, he was almost totally useless, so they left him as a gift to the\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nNow that they had come among the buffalo, wolves were often seen\r\nsneaking about and licking their hungry jaws; but although they\r\napproached pretty near to the camp at nights, they did not give the\r\nhunters any concern.  Even Crusoe became accustomed to them at last, and\r\nceased to notice them.  These creatures are very dangerous sometimes,\r\nhowever, and when hard pressed by hunger will even attack man.  The day\r\nafter this hunt the travellers came upon a wounded old buffalo which had\r\nevidently escaped from the Indians (for a couple of arrows were sticking\r\nin its side), only to fall a prey to his deadly enemies, the white\r\nwolves.  These savage brutes hang on the skirts of the herds of\r\nbuffaloes to attack and devour any one that may chance, from old age, or\r\nfrom being wounded, to linger behind the rest.  The buffalo is tough and\r\nfierce, however, and fights so desperately that although surrounded by\r\nfifty or a hundred wolves, he keeps up the unequal combat for several\r\ndays before he finally succumbs.\r\n\r\nThe old bull that our travellers discovered had evidently been long\r\nengaged with his ferocious adversaries, for his limbs and flesh were\r\ntorn in shreds in many places, and blood was streaming from his sides.\r\nYet he had fought so gallantly that he had tossed and stamped to death\r\ndozens of the enemy.  There could not have been fewer than fifty wolves\r\nround him; and they had just concluded another of many futile attacks,\r\nwhen the hunters came up, for they were ranged in a circle round their\r\nhuge adversary--some lying down, some sitting on their haunches to rest,\r\nand others sneaking about, lolling out their red tongues, and licking\r\ntheir chops as if impatient to renew the combat.  The poor buffalo was\r\nnearly spent, and it was clear that a few hours more would see him torn\r\nto shreds and his bones picked clean.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! de brutes,\" ejaculated Henri.\r\n\r\n\"They don't seem to mind us a bit,\" remarked Dick, as they rode up to\r\nwithin pistol shot.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be merciful to give the old fellow a shot,\" said Joe.  \"Them\r\nvarmits are sure to finish him at last.\"\r\n\r\nJoe raised his rifle as he spoke, and fired.  The old bull gave his last\r\ngroan and fell, while the wolves, alarmed by the shot, fled in all\r\ndirections; but they did not run far.  They knew well that some portion,\r\nat least, of the carcase would fall to their share, so they sat down at\r\nvarious distances all round, to wait as patiently as they might for the\r\nhunters to retire.  Dick left the scene with a feeling of regret that\r\nthe villanous wolves should have their feast so much sooner than they\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nYet after all, why should we call these wolves villanous?  They did\r\nnothing wrong--nothing contrary to the laws of their peculiar nature.\r\nNay, if we come to reason upon it, they rank higher in this matter than\r\nman, for while the wolf does no violence to the laws of its instincts,\r\nman often deliberately silences the voice of conscience, and violates\r\nthe laws of his own nature.  But we will not insist on the term, good\r\nreader, if you object strongly to it.  We are willing to admit that the\r\nwolves are _not_ villanous, but, _assuredly_, they are unlovable.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon the three horsemen reached a small creek,\r\nthe banks of which were lined with a few stunted shrubs and trees.\r\nHaving eaten nothing since the night before, they dismounted here to\r\n\"feed,\" as Joe expressed it.\r\n\r\n\"Cur'ous thing,\" remarked Joe, as he struck a light by means of flint,\r\nsteel, and tinder-box,--\"curious thing that we're made to need sich a\r\nlot o' grub.  If we could only get on like the sarpints, now, wot can\r\nbreakfast on a rabbit, and then wait a month or two for dinner!  Ain't\r\nit cur'ous?\"\r\n\r\nDick admitted that it was, and stooped to blow the fire into a blaze.\r\n\r\nHere Henri uttered a cry of consternation, and stood speechless, with\r\nhis mouth open.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? what is't?\" cried Dick and Joe, seizing their rifles\r\ninstinctively.\r\n\r\n\"De--grub--him--be--forgat!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a look of blank horror, and then a burst of laughter from Dick\r\nVarley.  \"Well, well,\" cried he, \"we've got lots o' tea an' sugar, an'\r\nsome flour; we can git on wi' that till we shoot another buffalo, or\r\na-ha!\"\r\n\r\nDick observed a wild turkey stalking among the willows as he spoke.  It\r\nwas fully a hundred yards off, and only its head was seen above the\r\nleaves.  This was a matter of little moment, however, for by aiming a\r\nlittle lower he knew that he must hit the body; but Dick had driven the\r\nnail too often to aim at its body; he aimed at the bird's eye and cut\r\nits head off.\r\n\r\n\"Fetch it, Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\nIn three minutes it was at Dick's feet, and it is not too much to say\r\nthat in five minutes more it was in the pot.\r\n\r\nAs this unexpected supply made up for the loss of the meat which Henri\r\nhad forgotten at their last halting-place, their equanimity was\r\nrestored, and while the meal was in preparation Dick shouldered his\r\nrifle and went into the bush to try for another turkey.  He did not get\r\none, however, but he shot a couple of prairie-hens, which are excellent\r\neating.  Moreover, he found a large quantity of wild grapes and plums.\r\nThese were unfortunately not nearly ripe, but Dick resolved to try his\r\nhand at a new dish, so he stuffed the breast of his coat full of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the pot was emptied Dick washed it out, and put a little clean\r\nwater in it.  Then he poured some flour in, and stirred it well.  While\r\nthis was heating, he squeezed the sour grapes and plums into what Joe\r\ncalled a \"mush,\" mixed it with a spoonful of sugar, and emptied it into\r\nthe pot.  He also skimmed a quantity of the fat from the remains of the\r\nturkey soup, and added that to the mess, which he stirred with earnest\r\ndiligence till it boiled down into a sort of thick porridge.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye think it'll be good?\" asked Joe gravely; \"I've me doubts of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see.  Hold the tin dish, Henri.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care of de fingers.  Ha! it looks magnifique--superb!\"\r\n\r\nThe first spoonful produced an expression on Henri's face that needed\r\nnot to be interpreted.  It was as sour as vinegar.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll ha' to eat it yerself, Dick, lad,\" cried Joe, throwing down his\r\nspoon, and spitting out the unsavoury mess.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" cried Dick, bolting two or three mouthfuls, and trying to\r\nlook as if he liked it.  \"Try again; it's not so bad as you think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho--o--o--o--o!\" cried Henri, after the second mouthful.  \"'Tis\r\nvinaigre.  All de sugare in de pack would not make more sweeter one bite\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nDick was obliged to confess the dish a failure, so it was thrown out\r\nafter having been offered to Crusoe, who gave it one sniff and turned\r\naway in silence.  Then they mounted and resumed their journey.\r\n\r\nAt this place mosquitoes and horse-flies troubled our hunters and their\r\nsteeds a good deal.  The latter--especially were very annoying to the\r\npoor horses.  They bit them so much that the blood at last came\r\ntrickling down their sides.  They were troubled also, once or twice, by\r\ncockchafers and locusts, which annoyed them, not indeed by biting, but\r\nby flying blindly against their faces, and often narrowly missed hitting\r\nthem in the eyes.  Once particularly they were so bad, that Henri in his\r\nwrath opened his lips to pronounce a malediction on the whole race, when\r\na cockchafer flew straight into his mouth, and, to use his own forcible\r\nexpression, \"nearly knocked him off de hoss.\"  But these were minor\r\nevils, and scarcely cost the hunters a thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nWANDERINGS ON THE PRAIRIE--A WAR-PARTY--CHASED BY INDIANS--A BOLD LEAP\r\nFOR LIFE.\r\n\r\nFor many days the three hunters wandered over the trackless prairie in\r\nsearch of a village of the Sioux Indians, but failed to find one, for\r\nthe Indians were in the habit of shifting their ground, and following\r\nthe buffalo.  Several times they saw small isolated bands of Indians,\r\nbut these they carefully avoided, fearing they might turn out to be\r\nwar-parties, and if they fell into their hands the white men could not\r\nexpect civil treatment, whatever nation the Indians might belong to.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater portion of this time they met with numerous herds of\r\nbuffalo and deer, and were well supplied with food, but they had to cook\r\nit during the day, being afraid to light a fire at night while Indians\r\nwere prowling about.\r\n\r\nOne night they halted near the bed of a stream which was almost dry.\r\nThey had travelled a day and a night without water, and both men and\r\nhorses were almost choking, so that when they saw the trees on the\r\nhorizon which indicated the presence of a stream, they pushed forward\r\nwith almost frantic haste.\r\n\r\n\"Hope it's not dry,\" said Joe anxiously as they galloped up to it.  \"No,\r\nthere's water, lads,\" and they dashed forward to a pool that had not yet\r\nbeen dried up.  They drank long and eagerly before they noticed that the\r\npool was strongly impregnated with salt.  Many streams in those parts of\r\nthe prairies are quite salt, but fortunately this one was not utterly\r\nundrinkable, though it was very unpalatable.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make it better, lads,\" said Joe, digging a deep hole in the sand\r\nwith his hands, a little below the pool.  In a short time the water\r\nfiltered through, and though not rendered fresh, it was, nevertheless,\r\nmuch improved.\r\n\r\n\"We may light a fire to-night, d'ye think?\" inquired Dick; \"we've not\r\nseed Injuns for some days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pr'aps 'twould be better not,\" said Joe, \"but I daresay we're safe\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nA fire was therefore lighted in as sheltered a spot as could be found,\r\nand the three friends bivouacked as usual.  Towards dawn they were\r\naroused by an angry growl from Crusoe.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wolf likely,\" said Dick, but all three seized and cocked their\r\nrifles nevertheless.\r\n\r\nAgain Crusoe growled more angrily than before, and springing out of the\r\ncamp snuffed the breeze anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Up, lads; catch the nags!  There's something in the wind, for the dog\r\nniver did that afore.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the horses were saddled and the packs secured.\r\n\r\n\"Call in the dog,\" whispered Joe Blunt; \"if he barks they'll find out\r\nour whereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, Crusoe, come--\"\r\n\r\nIt was too late; the dog barked loudly and savagely at the moment, and a\r\ntroop of Indians came coursing over the plain.  On hearing the unwonted\r\nsound they wheeled directly and made for the camp.\r\n\r\n\"It's a war-party; fly, lads; nothin' 'll save our scalps now but our\r\nhorses' heels,\" cried Joe.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they vaulted into the saddle, and urged their steeds forward\r\nat the utmost speed.  The savages observed them, and with an exulting\r\nyell dashed after them.  Feeling that there was now no need of\r\nconcealment, the three horsemen struck off into the open prairie,\r\nintending to depend entirely on the speed and stamina of their horses.\r\nAs we have before remarked, they were good ones, but the Indians soon\r\nproved that they were equally well if not better mounted.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a hard run,\" said Joe in a low, muttering tone, and looking\r\nfurtively over his shoulder.  \"The varmints are mounted on wild horses,\r\nleastways they were wild not long agone.  Them chaps can throw the lasso\r\nand trip a mustang as well as a Mexican.  Mind the badger holes, Dick.\r\nHold in a bit, Henri, yer nag don't need drivin'--a foot in a hole just\r\nnow would cost us our scalps.  Keep down by the creek, lads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! how dey yell,\" said Henri in a savage tone, looking back, and\r\nshaking his rifle at them--an act that caused them to yell more fiercely\r\nthan ever.  \"Dis old pack-hoss give me moche trobel.\"\r\n\r\nThe pace was now tremendous.  Pursuers and pursued rose and sank on the\r\nprairie billows as they swept along, till they came to what is termed a\r\n\"dividing ridge,\" which is a cross wave, as it were, which cuts the\r\nothers in two, thus forming a continuous level.  Here they advanced more\r\neasily, but the advantage was equally shared with their pursuers, who\r\ncontinued the headlong pursuit with occasional yells, which served to\r\nshow the fugitives that they at least did not gain ground.\r\n\r\nA little to the right of the direction in which they were flying a blue\r\nline was seen on the horizon.  This indicated the existence of trees to\r\nJoe's practised eyes; and feeling that if the horses broke down they\r\ncould better make a last manful stand in the wood than on the plain he\r\nurged his steed towards it.  The savages noticed the movement at once,\r\nand uttered a yell of exultation, for they regarded it as an evidence\r\nthat the fugitives doubted the strength of their horses.\r\n\r\n\"Ye haven't got us yet,\" muttered Joe, with a sardonic grin.  \"If they\r\nget near us, Dick, keep yer eyes open, an' look out for yer neck, else\r\nthey'll drop a noose over it; they will, afore ye know they're near, an'\r\nhaul ye off like a sack.\"\r\n\r\nDick nodded in reply, but did not speak, for at that moment his eye was\r\nfixed on a small creek ahead which they must necessarily leap or dash\r\nacross.  It was lined with clumps of scattered shrubbery, and he glanced\r\nrapidly for the most suitable place to pass.  Joe and Henri did the\r\nsame, and having diverged a little to the different points chosen, they\r\ndashed through the shrubbery, and were hid from each other's view.  On\r\napproaching the edge of the stream, Dick found to his consternation that\r\nthe bank was twenty feet high opposite him, and too wide for any horse\r\nto clear.  Wheeling aside without checking speed, at the risk of\r\nthrowing his steed, he rode along the margin of the stream for a few\r\nhundred yards until he found a ford--at least such a spot as might be\r\ncleared by a bold leap.  The temporary check, however, had enabled an\r\nIndian to gain so close upon his heels, that his exulting yell sounded\r\nclose in his ear.\r\n\r\nWith a vigorous bound his gallant little horse went over.  Crusoe could\r\nnot take it, but he rushed down the one bank and up the other, so that\r\nhe only lost a few yards.  These few yards, however, were sufficient to\r\nbring the Indian close upon him as he cleared the stream at full gallop.\r\nThe savage whirled his lasso swiftly round for a second, and in another\r\nmoment Crusoe uttered a tremendous roar as he was tripped up violently\r\non the plain.\r\n\r\nDick heard the cry of his faithful dog, and turned quickly round, just\r\nin time to see him spring at the horse's throat, and bring both steed\r\nand rider down upon him.  Dick's heart leaped to his throat.  Had a\r\nthousand savages been rushing on him, he would have flown to the rescue\r\nof his favourite; but an unexpected obstacle came in the way.  His fiery\r\nlittle steed, excited by the headlong race and the howls of the Indians,\r\nhad taken the bit in his teeth and was now unmanageable.  He tore at the\r\nreins like a maniac, and in the height of his frenzy even raised the\r\nbutt of his rifle with the intent to strike the poor horse to the earth,\r\nbut his better nature prevailed.  He checked the uplifted hand, and with\r\na groan dropped the reins, and sank almost helplessly forward on the\r\nsaddle, for several of the Indians had left the main body and were\r\npursuing him alone, so that there would have been now no chance of his\r\nreaching the place where Crusoe fell, even if he could have turned his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nSpiritless, and utterly indifferent to what his fate might be, Dick\r\nVarley rode along with his head drooping, and keeping his seat almost\r\nmechanically, while the mettlesome little steed flew on over wave and\r\nhollow.  Gradually he awakened from this state of despair to a sense of\r\ndanger.  Glancing round he observed that the Indians were now far behind\r\nhim, though still pursuing.  He also observed that his companions were\r\ngalloping miles away on the horizon to the left, and that he had\r\nfoolishly allowed the savages to get between him and them.  The only\r\nchance that remained for him was to outride his pursuers, and circle\r\nround towards his comrades, and this he hoped to accomplish, for his\r\nlittle horse had now proved itself to be superior to those of the\r\nIndians, and there was good running in him still.\r\n\r\nUrging him forward, therefore, he soon left the savages still further\r\nbehind, and feeling confident that they could not now overtake him, he\r\nreined up and dismounted.  The pursuers quickly drew near, but short\r\nthough it was, the rest did his horse good.  Vaulting into the saddle,\r\nhe again stretched out, and now skirted along the margin of a wood which\r\nseemed to mark the position of a river of considerable size.\r\n\r\nAt this moment his horse put his foot into a badger hole, and both of\r\nthem came heavily to the ground.  In an instant Dick rose, picked up his\r\ngun, and leaped unhurt into the saddle.  But on urging his poor horse\r\nforward, he found that its shoulder was badly sprained.  There was no\r\nroom for mercy, however,--life and death were in the balance,--so he\r\nplied the lash vigorously, and the noble steed warmed into something\r\nlike a run, when again it stumbled, and fell with a crash on the ground,\r\nwhile the blood burst from its mouth and nostrils.  Dick could hear the\r\nshout of triumph uttered by his pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"My poor, poor horse!\" he exclaimed, in a tone of the deepest\r\ncommiseration, while he stooped and stroked its foam-studded neck.\r\n\r\nThe dying steed raised his head for a moment, it almost seemed as if to\r\nacknowledge the tones of affection, then it sank down with a gurgling\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\nDick sprang up, for the Indians were now upon him, and bounded like an\r\nantelope into the thickest of the shrubbery, which was nowhere thick\r\nenough, however, to prevent the Indians following.  Still, it\r\nsufficiently retarded them to render the chase a more equal one than\r\ncould have been expected.  In a few minutes Dick gained a strip of open\r\nground beyond, and found himself on the bank of a broad river, whose\r\nevidently deep waters rushed impetuously along their unobstructed\r\nchannel.  The bank at the spot where he reached it was a sheer precipice\r\nof between thirty and forty feet high.  Glancing up and down the river\r\nhe retreated a few paces, turned round and shook his clenched fist at\r\nthe savages, accompanying the action with a shout of defiance, and then\r\nrunning to the edge of the bank, sprang far out into the boiling flood\r\nand sank.\r\n\r\nThe Indians pulled up on reaching the spot.  There was no possibility of\r\ngalloping down the wood-encumbered banks after the fugitive, but quick\r\nas thought each Red-man leaped to the ground, and fitting an arrow to\r\nhis bow, awaited Dick's re-appearance with eager gaze.\r\n\r\nYoung though he was, and unskilled in such wild warfare, Dick knew well\r\nenough what sort of reception he would meet with on coming to the\r\nsurface, so he kept under water as long as he could, and struck out as\r\nvigorously as the care of his rifle would permit.  At last he rose for a\r\nfew seconds, and immediately half a dozen arrows whizzed through the\r\nair; but most of them fell short; only one passed close to his cheek,\r\nand went with a \"whip\" into the river.  He immediately sank again, and\r\nthe next time he rose to breathe he was far beyond the reach of his\r\nIndian enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nESCAPE FROM INDIANS--A DISCOVERY--ALONE IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\nDick Varley had spent so much of his boyhood in sporting about among the\r\nwaters of the rivers and lakes near which he had been reared, and\r\nespecially during the last two years had spent so much of his leisure\r\ntime in rolling and diving with his dog Crusoe in the lake of the\r\nMustang Valley, that he had become almost as expert in the water as a\r\nsouth-sea islander; so that when he found himself whirling down the\r\nrapid river, as already described, he was more impressed with a feeling\r\nof gratitude to God for his escape from the Indians, than anxiety about\r\ngetting ashore.\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether blind, or indifferent, to the danger into which he\r\nmight be hurled if the channel of the river should be found lower down\r\nto be broken with rocks, or should a waterfall unexpectedly appear.\r\nAfter floating down a sufficient distance to render pursuit out of the\r\nquestion, he struck in to the bank opposite to that from which he had\r\nplunged, and, clambering up to the green sward above, stripped off the\r\ngreater part of his clothing and hung it on the branches of a bush to\r\ndry.  Then he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree to consider what\r\ncourse he had best pursue in his present circumstances.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances were by no means calculated to inspire him with hope\r\nor comfort.  He was in the midst of an unknown wilderness, hundreds of\r\nmiles from any white man's settlement; surrounded by savages; without\r\nfood or blanket; his companions gone, he knew not whither; perhaps taken\r\nand killed by the Indians; his horse dead, and his dog, the most trusty\r\nand loving of all his friends, lost to him, probably, for ever!  A more\r\nveteran heart might have quailed in the midst of such accumulated evils,\r\nbut Dick Varley possessed a strong, young, and buoyant constitution,\r\nwhich, united with a hopefulness of disposition that almost nothing\r\ncould overcome, enabled him very quickly to cast aside the gloomy view\r\nof his case and turn to its brighter aspects.\r\n\r\nHe still grasped his good rifle, that was some comfort, and as his eye\r\nfell upon it, he turned with anxiety to examine into the condition of\r\nhis powder-horn and the few things that he had been fortunate enough to\r\ncarry away with him about his person.\r\n\r\nThe horn in which western hunters carry their powder is usually that of\r\nan ox.  It is closed up at the large end with a piece of hard wood\r\nfitted tightly into it, and the small end is closed with a wooden peg or\r\nstopper.  It is, therefore, completely water-tight, and may be for hours\r\nimmersed without the powder getting wet unless the stopper should chance\r\nto be knocked out.  Dick found, to his great satisfaction, that the\r\nstopper was fast, and the powder perfectly dry.  Moreover, he had by\r\ngood fortune filled it full two days before from the package that\r\ncontained the general stock of ammunition, so that there were only two\r\nor three charges out of it.  His percussion caps, however, were\r\ncompletely destroyed, and even though they had not been, it would have\r\nmattered little, for he did not possess more than half a dozen.  But\r\nthis was not so great a misfortune as at first it might seem, for he had\r\nthe spare flint locks and the little screw-driver necessary for fixing\r\nand unfixing them stowed away in his shot pouch.\r\n\r\nTo examine his supply of bullets was his next care, and slowly he\r\ncounted them out, one by one, to the number of thirty.  This was a\r\npretty fair supply, and with careful economy would last him many days.\r\nHaving relieved his mind on these all-important points, he carefully\r\nexamined every pouch and corner of his dress to ascertain the exact\r\namount and value of his wealth.\r\n\r\nBesides the leather-leggings, moccasins, deerskin hunting shirt, cap,\r\nand belt which composed his costume, he had a short heavy hunting-knife,\r\na piece of tinder, a little tin pannikin, which he had been in the habit\r\nof carrying at his belt, and a large cake of maple sugar.  This last is\r\na species of sugar which is procured by the Indians from the maple-tree.\r\nSeveral cakes of it had been carried off from the Pawnee village, and\r\nDick usually carried one in the breast of his coat.  Besides these\r\nthings, he found that the little Bible, for which his mother had made a\r\nsmall inside breast pocket, was safe.  Dick's heart smote him when he\r\ntook it out and undid the clasp, for he had not looked at it until that\r\nday.  It was firmly bound with a brass clasp, so that although the\r\nbinding and edges of the leaves were soaked, the inside was quite dry.\r\nOn opening the book to see if it had been damaged, a small paper fell\r\nout.  Picking it up quickly, he unfolded it, and read, in his mother's\r\nhandwriting, \"_Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver\r\nthee, and thou shalt glorify me.  My son, give me thine heart_.\"\r\n\r\nDick's eyes filled with tears while the sound, as it were, of his\r\nmother's voice thus reached him unexpectedly in that lonely wilderness.\r\nLike too many whose hearts are young and gay, Dick had regarded\r\nreligion, if not as a gloomy, at least as not a cheerful thing.  But he\r\nfelt the comfort of these words at that moment, and he resolved\r\nseriously to peruse his mother's parting gift in time to come.\r\n\r\nThe sun was hot, and a warm breeze gently shook the leaves, so that\r\nDick's garments were soon dry.  A few minutes served to change the locks\r\nof his rifle, draw the wet charges, dry out the barrels, and re-load.\r\nThen, throwing it across his shoulder, he entered the wood, and walked\r\nlightly away.  And well he might, poor fellow, for at that moment he\r\nfelt light enough in person if not in heart.  His worldly goods were not\r\nsuch as to oppress him, but the little note had turned his thoughts\r\ntowards home, and he felt comforted.\r\n\r\nTraversing the belt of woodland that marked the course of the river,\r\nDick soon emerged on the wide prairie beyond, and here he paused in some\r\nuncertainty as to how he should proceed.\r\n\r\nHe was too good a backwoodsman, albeit so young, to feel perplexed as to\r\nthe points of the compass.  He knew pretty well what hour it was, so\r\nthat the sun showed him the general bearings of the country, and he knew\r\nthat when night came he could correct his course by the pole star.\r\nDick's knowledge of astronomy was limited; he knew only one star by\r\nname, but that one was an inestimable treasure of knowledge.  His\r\nperplexity was owing to his uncertainty as to the direction in which his\r\ncompanions and their pursuers had gone, for he had made up his mind to\r\nfollow their trail if possible, and render all the succour his single\r\narm might afford.  To desert them, and make for the settlement, he held,\r\nwould be a faithless and cowardly act.\r\n\r\nWhile they were together Joe Blunt had often talked to him about the\r\nroute he meant to pursue to the Rocky Mountains, so that, if they had\r\nescaped the Indians, he thought there might be some chance of finding\r\nthem at last.  But, to set against this, there was the probability that\r\nthey had been taken and carried away in a totally different direction,\r\nor they might have taken to the river, as he had done, and gone further\r\ndown without his observing them.  Then, again, if they had escaped, they\r\nwould be sure to return and search the country round for him, so that if\r\nhe left the spot he might miss them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for my dear pup Crusoe!\" he exclaimed aloud in this dilemma; but\r\nthe faithful ear was shut now, and the deep silence that followed his\r\ncry was so oppressive that the young hunter sprang forward at a run over\r\nthe plain, as if to fly from solitude.  He soon became so absorbed,\r\nhowever, in his efforts to find the trail of his companions, that he\r\nforgot all other considerations, and ran straight forward for hours\r\ntogether, with his eyes eagerly fixed on the ground.  At last he felt so\r\nhungry, having tasted no food since supper-time the previous evening,\r\nthat he halted for the purpose of eating a morsel of maple sugar.  A\r\nline of bushes in the distance indicated water, so he sped on again, and\r\nwas soon seated beneath a willow, drinking water from the cool stream.\r\nNo game was to be found here; but there were several kinds of berries,\r\namong which wild grapes and plums grew in abundance.  With these and\r\nsome sugar he made a meal, though not a good one, for the berries were\r\nquite green, and intensely sour.\r\n\r\nAll that day Dick Varley followed up the trail of his companions, which\r\nhe discovered at a ford in the river.  They had crossed, therefore, in\r\nsafety, though still pursued, so he ran on at a regular trot, and with a\r\nlittle more hope than he had felt during the day.  Towards night,\r\nhowever, Dick's heart sank again, for he came upon innumerable buffalo\r\ntracks, among which those of the horses soon became mingled up, so that\r\nhe lost them altogether.  Hoping to find them again more easily by broad\r\ndaylight, he went to the nearest clump of willows he could find, and\r\nencamped for the night.\r\n\r\nRemembering the use formerly made of the tall willows, he set to work to\r\nconstruct a covering to protect him from the dew.  As he had no blanket\r\nor buffalo-skin, he used leaves and grass instead, and found it a better\r\nshelter than he had expected, especially when the fire was lighted, and\r\na pannikin of hot sugar and water smoked at his feet; but as no game was\r\nto be found, he was again compelled to sup off unripe berries.  Before\r\nlying down to rest he remembered his resolution, and, pulling out the\r\nlittle Bible, read a portion of it by the fitful blaze of the fire, and\r\nfelt great comfort in its blessed words.  It seemed to him like a friend\r\nwith whom he could converse in the midst of his loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe plunge into the river having broken Dick's pipe and destroyed his\r\ntobacco, he now felt the want of that luxury very severely, and, never\r\nhaving wanted it before, he was greatly surprised to find how much he\r\nhad become enslaved to the habit.  It cost him more than an hour's rest\r\nthat night, the craving for his wonted pipe.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious reader will doubtless not fail here to ask himself the\r\nquestion, whether it is wise in man to create in himself an unnatural\r\nand totally unnecessary appetite, which may, and often does, entail\r\nhours--ay, sometimes months--of exceeding discomfort; but we would not\r\nfor a moment presume to suggest such a question to him.  We have a\r\ndistinct objection to the ordinary method of what is called \"drawing a\r\nmoral.\"  It is much better to leave wise men to do this for themselves.\r\n\r\nNext morning Dick rose with the sun, and started without breakfast,\r\npreferring to take his chance of finding a bird or animal of some kind\r\nbefore long, to feeding again on sour berries.  He was disappointed,\r\nhowever, in finding the tracks of his companions.  The ground here was\r\nhard and sandy, so that little or no impression of a distinct kind was\r\nmade on it; and, as buffaloes had traversed it in all directions, he was\r\nsoon utterly bewildered.  He thought it possible that, by running out\r\nfor several miles in a straight line, and then taking a wide circuit\r\nround, he might find the tracks emerging from the confusion made by the\r\nbuffaloes.  But he was again disappointed, for the buffalo tracks still\r\ncontinued, and the ground became less capable of showing a footprint.\r\n\r\nSoon Dick began to feel so ill and weak from eating such poor fare, that\r\nhe gave up all hope of discovering the tracks, and was compelled to push\r\nforward at his utmost speed in order to reach a less barren district,\r\nwhere he might procure fresh meat; but the further he advanced the worse\r\nand more sandy did the district become.  For several days he pushed on\r\nover this arid waste without seeing bird or beast, and, to add to his\r\nmisery, he failed at last to find water.  For a day and a night he\r\nwandered about in a burning fever, and his throat so parched that he was\r\nalmost suffocated.  Towards the close of the second day he saw a slight\r\nline of bushes away down in a hollow on his right.  With eager steps he\r\nstaggered towards them, and, on drawing near, beheld--blessed sight!--a\r\nstream of water glancing in the beams of the setting sun.\r\n\r\nDick tried to shout for joy, but his parched throat refused to give\r\nutterance to the voice.  It mattered not; exerting all his remaining\r\nstrength he rushed down the bank, dropped his rifle, and plunged\r\nhead-foremost into the stream.\r\n\r\nThe first mouthful sent a thrill of horror to his heart; it was salt as\r\nbrine.\r\n\r\nThe poor youth's cup of bitterness was now full to overflowing.\r\nCrawling out of the stream, he sank down on the bank in a species of\r\nlethargic torpor, from which he awakened next morning in a raging fever.\r\nDelirium soon rendered him insensible to his sufferings.  The sun rose\r\nlike a ball of fire, and shone down with scorching power on the arid\r\nplain.  What mattered it to Dick?  He was far away in the shady groves\r\nof the Mustang Valley, chasing the deer at times, but more frequently\r\ncooling his limbs and sporting with Crusoe in the bright blue lake.  Now\r\nhe was in his mother's cottage, telling her how he had thought of her\r\nwhen far away on the prairie, and what a bright, sweet word it was she\r\nhad whispered in his ear,--so unexpectedly, too.  Anon he was scouring\r\nover the plains on horseback, with the savages at his heels; and at such\r\ntimes Dick would spring with almost supernatural strength from the\r\nground, and run madly over the burning plain; but, as if by a species of\r\nfascination, he always returned to the salt river, and sank exhausted by\r\nits side, or plunged helplessly into its waters.\r\n\r\nThese sudden immersions usually restored him for a short time to reason,\r\nand he would crawl up the bank and gnaw a morsel of the maple sugar; but\r\nhe could not eat much, for it was in a tough, compact cake, which his\r\njaws had not power to break.  All that day and the next night he lay on\r\nthe banks of the salt stream, or rushed wildly over the plain.  It was\r\nabout noon of the second day after his attack that he crept slowly out\r\nof the water, into which he had plunged a few seconds before.  His mind\r\nwas restored, but he felt an indescribable sensation of weakness, that\r\nseemed to him to be the approach of death.  Creeping towards the place\r\nwhere his rifle lay, he fell exhausted beside it, and laid his cheek on\r\nthe Bible, which had fallen out of his pocket there.\r\n\r\nWhile his eyes were closed in a dreamy sort of half-waking slumber, he\r\nfelt the rough, hairy coat of an animal brush against his forehead.  The\r\nidea of being torn to pieces by wolves flashed instantly across his\r\nmind, and with a shriek of terror he sprang up,--to be almost\r\noverwhelmed by the caresses of his faithful dog.\r\n\r\nYes, there he was, bounding round his master, barking and whining, and\r\ngiving vent to every possible expression of canine joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nCRUSOE'S RETURN AND HIS PRIVATE ADVENTURES AMONG THE INDIANS--DICK AT A\r\nVERY LOW EBB--CRUSOE SAVES HIM.\r\n\r\nThe means by which Crusoe managed to escape from his two-legged captors,\r\nand rejoin his master, requires separate and special notice.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle with the fallen horse and Indian, which Dick had seen\r\nbegun but not concluded, he was almost crushed to death; and the instant\r\nthe Indian gained his feet, he sent an arrow at his head with savage\r\nviolence.  Crusoe, however, had been so well used to dodging the\r\nblunt-headed arrows that were wont to be shot at him by the boys of the\r\nMustang Valley, that he was quite prepared, and eluded the shaft by an\r\nactive bound.  Moreover, he uttered one of his own peculiar roars, flew\r\nat the Indian's throat, and dragged him down.  At the same moment the\r\nother Indians came up, and one of them turned aside to the rescue.  This\r\nman happened to have an old gun, of the cheap sort at that time\r\nexchanged for peltries by the fur-traders.  With the butt of this he\r\nstruck Crusoe a blow on the head that sent him sprawling on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the savages, as we have seen, continued in pursuit of Dick\r\nuntil he leaped into the river; then they returned, took the saddle and\r\nbridle off his dead horse, and rejoined their comrades.  Here they held\r\na court-martial on Crusoe, who was now bound, foot and muzzle, with\r\ncords.  Some were for killing him; others, who admired his noble\r\nappearance, immense size, and courage, thought it would be well to carry\r\nhim to their village and keep him.  There was a pretty violent dispute\r\non the subject; but at length it was agreed that they should spare his\r\nlife in the mean time, and perhaps have a dog-dance round him when they\r\ngot to their wigwams.\r\n\r\nThis dance, of which Crusoe was to be the chief, though passive\r\nperformer, is peculiar to some of the tribes east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and consists in killing a dog and cutting out its liver,\r\nwhich is afterwards sliced into shreds or strings and hung on a pole\r\nabout the height of a man's head.  A band of warriors then come and\r\ndance wildly round this pole, and each one in succession goes up to the\r\nraw liver and bites a piece off it, without, however, putting his hands\r\nnear it.  Such is the dog-dance, and to such was poor Crusoe destined by\r\nhis fierce captors, especially by the one whose throat still bore very\r\nevident marks of his teeth.\r\n\r\nBut Crusoe was much too clever a dog to be disposed of in so disgusting\r\na manner.  He had privately resolved in his own mind that he would\r\nescape, but the hopelessness of his ever carrying that resolution into\r\neffect would have been apparent to any one who could have seen the way\r\nin which his muzzle was secured, and his four paws were tied together in\r\na bunch, as he hung suspended across the saddle of one of the savages!\r\n\r\nThis particular party of Indians who had followed Dick Varley determined\r\nnot to wait for the return of their comrades who were in pursuit of the\r\nother two hunters, but to go straight home, so for several days they\r\ngalloped away over the prairie.  At nights, when they encamped, Crusoe\r\nwas thrown on the ground like a piece of old lumber, and left to lie\r\nthere with a mere scrap of food till morning, when he was again thrown\r\nacross the horse of his captor and carried on.  When the village was\r\nreached, he was thrown again on the ground, and would certainly have\r\nbeen torn to pieces in five minutes by the Indian curs which came\r\nhowling round him, had not an old woman come to the rescue and driven\r\nthem away.  With the help of her grandson--a little naked creature, just\r\nable to walk, or rather to stagger--she dragged him to her tent, and,\r\nundoing the line that fastened his mouth, offered him a bone.\r\n\r\nAlthough lying in a position that was unfavourable for eating purposes,\r\nCrusoe opened his jaws and took it.  An awful crash was followed by two\r\ncrunches--and it was gone; and Crusoe looked up in the old squaw's face\r\nwith a look that said plainly, \"Another of the same, please, and as\r\nquick as possible.\"  The old woman gave him another and then a lump of\r\nmeat, which latter went down with a gulp--but he coughed after it! and\r\nit was well he didn't choke.  After this the squaw left him, and Crusoe\r\nspent the remainder of that night gnawing the cords that bound him.  So\r\ndiligent was he that he was free before morning and walked deliberately\r\nout of the tent.  Then he shook himself, and with a yell that one might\r\nhave fancied was intended for defiance, he bounded joyfully away, and\r\nwas soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nTo a dog with a good appetite which had been on short allowance for\r\nseveral days, the mouthful given to him by the old squaw was a mere\r\nnothing.  All that day he kept bounding over the plain from bluff to\r\nbluff in search of something to eat, but found nothing until dusk, when\r\nhe pounced suddenly and most unexpectedly on a prairie-hen fast asleep.\r\nIn one moment its life was gone.  In less than a minute its body was\r\ngone too--feathers and bones and all--down Crusoe's ravenous throat.\r\n\r\nOn the identical spot Crusoe lay down and slept like a top for four\r\nhours.  At the end of that time he jumped up, bolted a scrap of skin\r\nthat somehow had been overlooked at supper, and flew straight over the\r\nprairie to the spot where he had had the scuffle with the Indian.  He\r\ncame to the edge of the river, took precisely the same leap that his\r\nmaster had done before him, and came out on the other side a good deal\r\nhigher up than Dick had done, for the dog had no savages to dodge, and\r\nwas, as we have said before, a powerful swimmer.\r\n\r\nIt cost him a good deal of running about to find the trail, and it was\r\nnearly dark before he resumed his journey; then, putting his keen nose\r\nto the ground, he ran step by step over Dick's track, and at last found\r\nhim, as we have shown, on the banks of the Salt Creek.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to describe the intense joy which filled Dick's\r\nheart on again beholding his favourite.  Only those who have lost and\r\nfound such an one can know it.  Dick seized him round the neck and\r\nhugged him as well as he could, poor fellow, in his feeble arms; then he\r\nwept, then he laughed, and then he fainted.\r\n\r\nThis was a consummation that took Crusoe quite aback!  Never having seen\r\nhis master in such a state before he seemed to think at first that he\r\nwas playing some trick, for he bounded round him, and barked, and wagged\r\nhis tail.  But as Dick lay quite still and motionless, he went forward\r\nwith a look of alarm; snuffed him once or twice and whined piteously;\r\nthen he raised his nose in the air and uttered a long melancholy wail.\r\n\r\nThe cry seemed to revive Dick, for he moved, and with some difficulty\r\nsat up, to the dog's evident relief.  There is no doubt whatever that\r\nCrusoe learned an erroneous lesson that day, and was firmly convinced\r\nthenceforth that the best cure for a fainting-fit is a melancholy yell.\r\nSo easy is it for the wisest of dogs as well as men to fall into gross\r\nerror!\r\n\r\n\"Crusoe,\" said Dick, in a feeble voice, \"dear good pup, come here.\"  He\r\ncrawled, as he spoke, down to the water's edge where there was a level\r\npatch of dry sand.\r\n\r\n\"Dig,\" said Dick, pointing to the sand.\r\n\r\nCrusoe looked at him in surprise, as well he might, for he had never\r\nheard the word \"dig\" in all his life before.\r\n\r\nDick pondered a minute; then a thought struck him.  He turned up a\r\nlittle of the sand with his fingers, and, pointing to the hole cried,\r\n\"_Seek him out, pup_!\"\r\n\r\nHa!  Crusoe understood _that_.  Many and many a time had he unhoused\r\nrabbits, and squirrels, and other creatures at that word of command, so,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, he commenced to dig down into the sand, every\r\nnow, and then stopping for a moment and shoving in his nose, and\r\nsnuffing interrogatively, as if he fully expected to find a buffalo at\r\nthe bottom of it.  Then he would resume again, one paw after another so\r\nfast that you could scarce see them going \"hand over hand\" as sailors\r\nwould have called it--while the sand flew out between his hind-legs in a\r\ncontinuous shower.  When the sand accumulated so much behind him as to\r\nimpede his motions he scraped it out of his way, and set to work again\r\nwith tenfold earnestness.  After a good while he paused and looked up at\r\nDick with an \"it--won't--do,--I--fear,--there's--nothing--here\"\r\nexpression on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Seek him out, pup!\" repeated Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! very good,\" mutely answered the dog, and went at it again, tooth\r\nand nail, harder than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a quarter of an hour there was a deep yawning hole in\r\nthe sand, into which Dick peered with intense anxiety.  The bottom\r\nappeared slightly _damp_.  Hope now reanimated Dick Varley, and by\r\nvarious devices he succeeded in getting the dog to scrape away a sort of\r\ntunnel from the hole, into which he might roll himself and put down his\r\nlips to drink when the water should rise high enough.  Impatiently and\r\nanxiously he lay watching the moisture slowly accumulate in the bottom\r\nof the hole, drop by drop, and while he gazed he fell into a troubled,\r\nrestless slumber, and dreamed that Crusoe's return was a dream, and that\r\nhe was alone again perishing for want of water.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened the hole was half full of clear water, and Crusoe was\r\nlapping it greedily.\r\n\r\n\"Back, pup!\" he shouted, as he crept down to the hole and put his\r\ntrembling lips to the water.  It was brackish, but drinkable, and as\r\nDick drank deeply of it he esteemed it at that moment better than\r\nnectar.  Here he lay for half an hour alternately drinking and gazing in\r\nsurprise at his own emaciated visage as reflected in the pool.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon Crusoe, in a private hunting excursion of his own,\r\ndiscovered and caught a prairie-hen, which he quietly proceeded to\r\ndevour on the spot, when Dick, who saw what had occurred, whistled to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nObedience was engrained in every fibre of Crusoe's mental and corporeal\r\nbeing.  He did not merely answer at once to the call--he _sprang_ to it,\r\nleaving the prairie-hen untasted.\r\n\r\n\"Fetch it, pup,\" cried Dick eagerly as the dog came up.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the hen was at his feet.  Dick's circumstances could\r\nnot brook the delay of cookery; he gashed the bird with his knife and\r\ndrank the blood, and then gave the flesh to the dog, while he crept to\r\nthe pool again for another draught.  Ah! think not, reader, that\r\nalthough we have treated this subject in a slight vein of pleasantry,\r\nbecause it ended well, that therefore our tale is pure fiction.  Not\r\nonly are Indians glad to satisfy the urgent cravings of hunger with raw\r\nflesh, but many civilised men and delicately nurtured, have done the\r\nsame--ay, and doubtless, will do the same again, as long as enterprising\r\nand fearless men shall go forth to dare the dangers of flood and field\r\nin the wild places of our wonderful world!\r\n\r\nCrusoe had finished his share of the feast before Dick returned from the\r\npool.  Then master and dog lay down together side by side and fell into\r\na long, deep, peaceful slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND HAPPINESS RETURN--INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY--A BUFFALO SHOT--A\r\nWILD HORSE \"CREASED\"--DICK'S BATTLE WITH A MUSTANG.\r\n\r\nDick Varley's fears and troubles, in the meantime, were ended.  On the\r\nday following he awoke refreshed and happy--so happy and light at heart,\r\nas he felt the glow of returning health coursing through his veins, that\r\nhe fancied he must have dreamed it all.  In fact, he was so certain that\r\nhis muscles were strong that he endeavoured to leap up, but was\r\npowerfully convinced of his true condition by the miserable stagger that\r\nresulted from the effort.\r\n\r\nHowever, he knew he was recovering, so he rose, and thanking God for his\r\nrecovery and for the new hope that was raised in his heart, he went down\r\nto the pool and drank deeply of its water.  Then he returned, and,\r\nsitting down beside his dog, opened the Bible and read long--and, for\r\nthe first time, _earnestly_--the story of Christ's love for sinful man.\r\nHe at last fell asleep over the book, and when he awakened felt so much\r\nrefreshed in body and mind that he determined to attempt to pursue his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nHe had not proceeded far when he came upon a colony of prairie-dogs.\r\nUpon this occasion he was little inclined to take a humorous view of the\r\nvagaries of these curious little creatures, but he shot one, and, as\r\nbefore, ate part of it raw.  These creatures are so active that they are\r\ndifficult to shoot, and even when killed generally fall into their holes\r\nand disappear.  Crusoe, however, soon unearthed the dead animal on this\r\noccasion.  That night the travellers came to a stream of fresh water,\r\nand Dick killed a turkey, so that he determined to spend a couple of\r\ndays there to recruit.  At the end of that time he again set out, but\r\nwas able only to advance five miles when he broke down.  In fact, it\r\nbecame evident to him that he must have a longer period of absolute\r\nrepose ere he could hope to continue his journey, but to do so without\r\nfood was impossible.  Fortunately there was plenty of water, as his\r\ncourse lay along the margin of a small stream, and, as the arid piece of\r\nprairie was now behind him, he hoped to fall in with birds, or perhaps\r\ndeer, soon.\r\n\r\nWhile he was plodding heavily and wearily along, pondering these things,\r\nhe came to the brow of a wave from which he beheld a most magnificent\r\nview of green grassy plains, decked with flowers, and rolling out to the\r\nhorizon, with a stream meandering through it, and clumps of trees\r\nscattered everywhere far and wide.  It was a glorious sight; but the\r\nmost glorious object in it to Dick, at that time, was a fat buffalo\r\nwhich stood grazing not a hundred yards off.  The wind was blowing\r\ntowards him, so that the animal did not scent him, and, as he came up\r\nvery slowly, and it was turned away, it did not see him.\r\n\r\nCrusoe would have sprung forward in an instant, but his master's finger\r\nimposed silence and caution.  Trembling with eagerness Dick sank flat\r\ndown in the grass, cocked both barrels of his piece, and, resting it on\r\nhis left hand with his left elbow on the ground, he waited until the\r\nanimal should present its side.  In a few seconds it moved; Dick's eye\r\nglanced along the barrel, but it trembled--his wonted steadiness of aim\r\nwas gone.  He fired, and the buffalo sprang off in terror.  With a groan\r\nof despair he fired again,--almost recklessly,--and the buffalo fell!\r\nIt rose once or twice and stumbled forward a few paces, then it fell\r\nagain.  Meanwhile Dick re-loaded with trembling hand, and advanced to\r\ngive it another shot, but it was not needful, the buffalo was already\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Crusoe,\" said Dick, sitting down on the buffalo's shoulder and\r\npatting his favourite on the head, \"we're all right at last.  You and I\r\nshall have a jolly time o't, pup, from this time for'ard.\"\r\n\r\nDick paused for breath, and Crusoe wagged his tail and looked as if to\r\nsay--pshaw! \"_as if_!\"\r\n\r\nWe tell ye what it is, reader, it's of no use at all to go on writing\r\n\"as if,\" when we tell you what Crusoe said.  If there is any language in\r\neyes whatever,--if there is language in a tail; in a cocked ear; in a\r\nmobile eyebrow; in the point of a canine nose;--if there is language in\r\nany terrestrial thing at all, apart from that which flows from the\r\ntongue--then Crusoe _spoke_!  Do we not speak at this moment to _you_?\r\nand if so, then tell me, wherein lies the difference between a written\r\n_letter_ and a given _sign_?\r\n\r\nYes, Crusoe spoke.  He said to Dick as plain as dog could say it, slowly\r\nand emphatically, \"That's my opinion precisely, Dick.  You're the\r\ndearest, most beloved, jolliest fellow that ever walked on two legs, you\r\nare; and whatever's your opinion is mine, no matter _how_ absurd it may\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nDick evidently understood him perfectly, for he laughed as he looked at\r\nhim and patted him on the head, and called him a \"funny dog.\"  Then he\r\ncontinued his discourse--\"Yes, pup, we'll make our camp here for a long\r\nbit, old dog, in this beautiful plain.  We'll make a willow wigwam to\r\nsleep in, you and me, jist in yon clump o' trees, not a stone's throw to\r\nour right, where we'll have a run o' pure water beside us, and be near\r\nour buffalo at the same time.  For, ye see, we'll need to watch him lest\r\nthe wolves take a notion to eat him--that'll be _your_ duty, pup.  Then\r\nI'll skin him when I get strong enough, which'll be in a day or two I\r\nhope, and we'll put one half of the skin below us and t'other half above\r\nus i' the camp, an' sleep, an' eat, an' take it easy for a week or two--\r\nwon't we, pup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoora-a-a-y!\" shouted Crusoe, with a jovial wag of his tail, that no\r\nhuman arm with hat, or cap, or kerchief ever equalled.\r\n\r\nPoor Dick Varley!  He smiled to think how earnestly he had been talking\r\nto the dog, but he did not cease to do it, for, although he entered into\r\ndiscourses, the drift of which Crusoe's limited education did not permit\r\nhim to follow, he found comfort in hearing the sound of his own voice,\r\nand in knowing that it fell pleasantly on another ear in that lonely\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nOur hero now set about his preparations as vigorously as he could.  He\r\ncut out the buffalo's tongue--a matter of great difficulty to one in his\r\nweak state--and carried it to a pleasant spot near to the stream where\r\nthe turf was level and green, and decked with wild flowers.  Here he\r\nresolved to make his camp.\r\n\r\nHis first care was to select a bush whose branches were long enough to\r\nform a canopy over his head when bent, and the ends thrust into the\r\nground.  The completing of this exhausted him greatly, but after a rest\r\nhe resumed his labours.  The next thing was to light a fire--a comfort\r\nwhich he had not enjoyed for many weary days.  Not that he required it\r\nfor warmth, for the weather was extremely warm, but he required it to\r\ncook with, and the mere _sight_ of a blaze in a dark place is a most\r\nheart-cheering thing as every one knows.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire was lighted he filled his pannikin at the brook and put it\r\non to boil, and, cutting several slices of buffalo tongue, he thrust\r\nshort stakes through them and set them up before the fire to roast.  By\r\nthis time the water was boiling, so he took it off with difficulty,\r\nnearly burning his fingers and singeing the tail of his coat in so\r\ndoing.  Into the pannikin he put a lump of maple sugar and stirred it\r\nabout with a stick, and tasted it.  It seemed to him even better than\r\ntea or coffee.  It was absolutely delicious!\r\n\r\nReally one has no notion what he can do if he makes believe _very hard_.\r\nThe human mind is a nicely balanced and extremely complex machine, and\r\nwhen thrown a little off the balance can be made to believe almost\r\nanything, as we see in the case of some poor monomaniacs, who have\r\nfancied that they were made of all sorts of things--glass and porcelain,\r\nand suchlike.  No wonder then that poor Dick Varley, after so much\r\nsuffering and hardship, came to regard that pannikin of hot syrup as the\r\nmost delicious beverage he ever drank.\r\n\r\nDuring all these operations Crusoe sat on his haunches beside him and\r\nlooked.  And you haven't--no, you haven't--got the most distant notion\r\nof the way in which that dog manoeuvred with his head and face!  He\r\nopened his eyes wide, and cocked his ears, and turned his head first a\r\nlittle to one side, then a little to the other.  After that he turned it\r\na _good deal_ to one side and then a good deal more to the other.  Then\r\nhe brought it straight and raised one eyebrow a little, and then the\r\nother a little, and then both together very much.  Then, when Dick\r\npaused to rest and did nothing, Crusoe looked mild for a moment, and\r\nyawned vociferously.  Presently Dick moved--up went the ears again and\r\nCrusoe came--in military parlance--\"to the position of attention!\"  At\r\nlast supper was ready and they began.\r\n\r\nDick had purposely kept the dog's supper back from him, in order that\r\nthey might eat it in company.  And between every bite and sup that Dick\r\ntook, he gave a bite--but not a sup--to Crusoe.  Thus lovingly they ate\r\ntogether; and, when Dick lay that night under the willow branches\r\nlooking up through them at the stars, with his feet to the fire, and\r\nCrusoe close along his side, he thought it the best and sweetest supper\r\nhe ever ate, and the happiest evening he ever spent--so wonderfully do\r\ncircumstances modify our notions of felicity!\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after this \"Richard was himself again.\"  The muscles were\r\nspringy, and the blood coursed fast and free, as was its wont.  Only a\r\nslight, and, perhaps, salutary feeling of weakness remained, to remind\r\nhim that young muscles might again become more helpless than those of an\r\naged man or a child.\r\n\r\nDick had left his encampment a week ago, and was now advancing by rapid\r\nstages towards the Rocky Mountains, closely following the trail of his\r\nlost comrades, which he had no difficulty in finding and keeping, now\r\nthat Crusoe was with him.  The skin of the buffalo that he had killed\r\nwas now strapped to his shoulders, and the skin of another animal that\r\nhe had shot a few days after was cut up into a long line and slung in a\r\ncoil round his neck.  Crusoe was also laden.  He had a little bundle of\r\nmeat slung on each side of him.\r\n\r\nFor some time past numerous herds of mustangs or wild horses, had\r\ncrossed their path, and Dick was now on the look out for a chance to\r\n_crease_ one of those magnificent creatures.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a band of mustangs galloped close up to him before they\r\nwere aware of his presence, and stopped short with a wild snort of\r\nsurprise on beholding him; then, wheeling round, they dashed away at\r\nfull gallop, their long tails and manes flying wildly in the air, and\r\ntheir hoofs thundering on the plain.  Dick did not attempt to crease one\r\nupon this occasion, fearing that his recent illness might have rendered\r\nhis hand too unsteady for so extremely delicate an operation.\r\n\r\nIn order to crease a wild horse the hunter requires to be a perfect\r\nshot, and it is not every man of the west who carries a rifle that can\r\ndo it successfully.  Creasing consists in sending a bullet through the\r\ngristle of the mustang's neck, just above the bone, so as to stun the\r\nanimal.  If the ball enters a hair's-breadth too low, the horse falls\r\ndead instantly.  If it hits the exact spot the horse falls as\r\ninstantaneously, and dead to all appearance; but, in reality, he is only\r\nstunned, and if left for a few minutes will rise and gallop away nearly\r\nas well as ever.  When hunters crease a horse successfully they put a\r\nrope, or halter, round his under jaw, and hobbles round his feet, so\r\nthat when he rises he is secured, and, after considerable trouble,\r\nreduced to obedience.\r\n\r\nThe mustangs which roam in wild freedom on the prairies of the far west,\r\nare descended from the noble Spanish steeds that were brought over by\r\nthe wealthy cavaliers who accompanied Fernando Cortez, the conqueror of\r\nMexico, in his expedition to the new world in 1518.  These bold, and, we\r\nmay add, lawless cavaliers, were mounted on the finest horses that could\r\nbe procured from Barbary and the deserts of the Old World.  The poor\r\nIndians of the New World were struck with amazement and terror at these\r\nawful beings, for, never having seen horses before, they believed that\r\nhorse and rider were one animal.  During the wars that followed many of\r\nthe Spaniards were killed and their steeds bounded into the wilds of the\r\nnew country to enjoy a life of unrestrained freedom.  These were the\r\nforefathers of the present race of magnificent creatures which are found\r\nin immense droves all over the western wilderness, from the Gulf of\r\nMexico to the confines of the snowy regions of the far north.\r\n\r\nAt first the Indians beheld these horses with awe and terror, but\r\ngradually they became accustomed to them, and finally succeeded in\r\ncapturing great numbers and reducing them to a state of servitude.  Not,\r\nhowever, to the service of the cultivated field, but to the service of\r\nthe chase and war.  The savages soon acquired the method of capturing\r\nwild horses by means of the lasso--as the noose at that end of a long\r\nline of raw hide is termed--which they adroitly threw over the heads of\r\nthe animals and secured them, having previously run them down.  At the\r\npresent day many of the savage tribes of the west almost live upon\r\nhorseback, and without these useful creatures they could scarcely\r\nsubsist, as they are almost indispensable in the chase of the buffalo.\r\n\r\nMustangs are regularly taken by the Indians to the settlements of the\r\nwhite men for trade, but very poor specimens are these of the breed of\r\nwild horses.  This arises from two causes.  First, the Indian cannot\r\novertake the finest of a drove of wild mustangs, because his own steed\r\nis inferior to the best among the wild ones, besides being weighted with\r\na rider, so that only the weak and inferior animals are captured.  And,\r\nsecondly, when the Indian does succeed in lassoing a first-rate horse he\r\nkeeps it for his own use.  Thus, those who have not visited the far-off\r\nprairies and seen the mustang in all the glory of untrammelled freedom,\r\ncan form no adequate idea of its beauty, fleetness, and strength.\r\n\r\nThe horse, however, was not the only creature imported by Cortez.  There\r\nwere priests in his army who rode upon asses, and, although we cannot\r\nimagine that the \"fathers\" charged with the cavaliers and were unhorsed,\r\nor, rather, un-assed in battle, yet, somehow, the asses got rid of their\r\nriders and joined the Spanish chargers in their joyous bound into a new\r\nlife of freedom.  Hence wild asses also are found in the western\r\nprairies.  But think not, reader, of those poor miserable wretches we\r\nsee at home, which seem little better than rough door-mats sewed up and\r\nstuffed; with head, tail, and legs attached, and just enough of life\r\ninfused to make them move!  No, the wild ass of the prairie is a large,\r\npowerful, swift creature.  He has the same long ears, it is true, and\r\nthe same hideous, exasperating bray, and the same tendency to flourish\r\nhis heels; but, for all that he is a very fine animal, and often wages\r\n_successful_ warfare with the wild horse!\r\n\r\nBut to return.  The next drove of mustangs that Dick and Crusoe saw were\r\nfeeding quietly and unsuspectingly in a rich green hollow in the plain.\r\nDick's heart leaped up as his eyes suddenly fell on them, for he had\r\nalmost discovered himself before he was aware of their presence.\r\n\r\n\"Down, pup!\" he whispered, as he sank and disappeared among the grass\r\nwhich was just long enough to cover him when lying quite flat.\r\n\r\nCrusoe crouched immediately, and his master made his observations of the\r\ndrove, and the dispositions of the ground that might favour his\r\napproach, for they were not within rifle range.  Having done so he crept\r\nslowly back until the undulation of the prairie hid him from view; then\r\nhe sprang to his feet, and ran a considerable distance along the bottom\r\nuntil he gained the extreme end of a belt of low bushes, which would\r\neffectually conceal him while he approached to within a hundred yards or\r\nless of the troop.\r\n\r\nHere he made his arrangements.  Throwing down his buffalo robe, he took\r\nthe coil of line and cut off a piece of about three yards in length.  On\r\nthis he made a running noose.  The longer line he also prepared with a\r\nrunning noose.  These he threw in a coil over his arm.\r\n\r\nHe also made a pair of hobbles and placed them in the breast of his\r\ncoat, and then, taking up his rifle, advanced cautiously through the\r\nbushes--Crusoe following close behind him.  In a few minutes he was\r\ngazing in admiration at the mustangs which were now within easy shot,\r\nand utterly ignorant of the presence of man, for Dick had taken care to\r\napproach in such a way that the wind did not carry the scent of him in\r\ntheir direction.\r\n\r\nAnd well might he admire them.  The wild horse of these regions is not\r\nvery large, but it is exceedingly powerful, with prominent eye, sharp\r\nnose, distended nostril, small feet, and a delicate leg.  Their\r\nbeautiful manes hung at great length down their arched necks, and their\r\nthick tails swept the ground.  One magnificent fellow in particular\r\nattracted Dick's attention.  It was of a rich dark brown colour, with\r\nblack mane and tail, and seemed to be the leader of the drove.\r\n\r\nAlthough not the nearest to him, he resolved to crease this horse.  It\r\nis said that creasing generally destroys or damages the spirit of the\r\nhorse, so Dick determined to try whether his powers of close shooting\r\nwould not serve him on this occasion.  Going down on one knee he aimed\r\nat the creature's neck, just a hair-breadth above the spot where he had\r\nbeen told that hunters usually hit them, and fired.  The effect upon the\r\ngroup was absolutely tremendous.  With wild cries and snorting terror\r\nthey tossed their proud heads in the air, uncertain for one moment in\r\nwhich direction to fly; then there was a rush as if a hurricane swept\r\nover the place, and they were gone.\r\n\r\nBut the brown horse was down.  Dick did not wait until the others had\r\nfled.  He dropped his rifle, and with the speed of a deer, sprang\r\ntowards the fallen horse, and affixed the hobbles to his legs.  His aim\r\nhad been true.  Although scarcely half a minute elapsed between the shot\r\nand the fixing of the hobbles the animal recovered, and with a frantic\r\nexertion rose on his haunches, just as Dick had fastened the noose of\r\nthe short line in his under jaw.  But this was not enough.  If the horse\r\nhad gained his feet before the longer line was placed round his neck, he\r\nwould have escaped.  As the mustang made the second violent plunge that\r\nplaced it on its legs, Dick flung the noose hastily; it caught on one\r\near, and would have fallen off, had not the horse suddenly shaken its\r\nhead, and unwittingly sealed its own fate by bringing the noose round\r\nits neck.\r\n\r\nAnd now the struggle began.  Dick knew well enough, from hearsay, the\r\nmethod of \"breaking down\" a wild horse.  He knew that the Indians choke\r\nthem with the noose round the neck until they fall down exhausted and\r\ncovered with foam, when they creep up, fix the hobbles and the line in\r\nthe lower jaw, and then loosen the lasso to let the horse breathe, and\r\nresume its plungings till it is almost subdued, when they gradually draw\r\nnear and breathe into its nostrils.  But the violence and strength of\r\nthis animal rendered this an apparently hopeless task.  We have already\r\nseen that the hobbles and noose in the lower jaw had been fixed, so that\r\nDick had nothing now to do but to choke his captive, and tire him out,\r\nwhile Crusoe remained a quiet, though excited spectator of the scene.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be no possibility of choking this horse.  Either the\r\nmuscles of his neck were too strong, or there was something wrong with\r\nthe noose which prevented it from acting, for the furious creature\r\ndashed and bounded backwards and sidewise in its terror for nearly an\r\nhour, dragging Dick after it, till he was almost exhausted, and yet, at\r\nthe end of that time, although flecked with foam and panting with\r\nterror, it seemed as strong as ever.  Dick held both lines, for the\r\nshort one attached to its lower jaw gave him great power over it.  At\r\nlast he thought of seeking assistance from his dog.\r\n\r\n\"Crusoe,\" he cried, \"lay hold, pup.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog seized the long line in his teeth, and pulled with all his\r\nmight.  At the some moment Dick let go the short line and threw all his\r\nweight upon the long one.  The noose tightened suddenly under this\r\nstrain, and the mustang, with a gasp, fell choking to the ground.\r\n\r\nDick had often heard of the manner in which the Mexicans \"break\" their\r\nhorses, so he determined to abandon the method which had already almost\r\nworn him out, and adopt the other, as far as the means in his power\r\nrendered it possible.  Instead, therefore, of loosening the lasso and\r\nre-commencing the struggle, he tore a branch from a neighbouring bush,\r\ncut the hobbles, strode with his legs across the fallen steed, seized\r\nthe end of the short line or bridle, and then, ordering Crusoe to quit\r\nhis hold, he loosened the noose which compressed the horse's neck, and\r\nhad already well-nigh terminated its existence.\r\n\r\nOne or two deep sobs restored it, and in a moment it leaped to its feet\r\nwith Dick firmly on its back!  To say that the animal leaped and kicked\r\nin its frantic efforts to throw this intolerable burden would be a tame\r\nmanner of expressing what took place.  Words cannot adequately describe\r\nthe scene.  It reared, plunged, shrieked, vaulted into the air, stood\r\nstraight up on its hind-legs, and then almost as straight upon its fore\r\nones, but its rider held on like a burr.  Then the mustang raced wildly\r\nforwards a few paces, then as wildly back, and then stood still and\r\ntrembled violently.  But this was only a brief lull in the storm, so\r\nDick saw that the time was now come to assert the superiority of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\"Stay back, Crusoe, and watch my rifle, pup,\" he cried, and, raising his\r\nheavy switch he brought it down with a sharp cut across the horse's\r\nflank, at the same time loosening the rein which hitherto he had held\r\ntight.\r\n\r\nThe wild horse uttered a passionate cry, and sprang forward like the\r\nbolt from a cross-bow.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced a race, which, if not as prolonged, was at least as\r\nfurious as that of the far-famed Mazeppa.  Dick was a splendid rider,\r\nhowever,--at least as far as \"sticking on\" goes.  He might not have come\r\nup to the precise pitch desiderated by a riding-master in regard to\r\ncarriage, etcetera, but he rode that wild horse of the prairie with as\r\nmuch ease as he had formerly ridden his own good steed, whose bones had\r\nbeen picked by the wolves not long ago.\r\n\r\nThe pace was tremendous, for the youth's weight was nothing to that\r\nmuscular frame which bounded with cat-like agility from wave to wave of\r\nthe undulating plain in ungovernable terror.  In a few minutes the clump\r\nof willows where Crusoe and his rifle lay were out of sight behind, but\r\nit mattered not, for Dick had looked up at the sky and noted the\r\nposition of the sun at the moment of starting.  Away they went on the\r\nwings of the wind, mile after mile over the ocean-like waste--curving\r\nslightly aside now and then to avoid the bluffs that occasionally\r\nappeared on the scene for a few minutes and then swept out of sight\r\nbehind them.  Then they came to a little rivulet; it was a mere brook of\r\na few feet wide, and two or three yards, perhaps, from bank to bank.\r\nOver this they flew, so easily that the spring was scarcely felt, and\r\ncontinued the headlong course.  And now a more barren country was around\r\nthem.  Sandy ridges and scrubby grass appeared everywhere, reminding\r\nDick of the place where he had been so ill.  Rocks, too were scattered\r\nabout, and at one place the horse dashed with clattering hoofs between a\r\ncouple of rocky sand-hills which, for a few seconds, hid the prairie\r\nfrom view.  Here the mustang suddenly shied with such violence that his\r\nrider was nearly thrown, while a rattlesnake darted from the path.  Soon\r\nthey emerged from this pass, and again the plains became green and\r\nverdant.  Presently a distant line of trees showed that they were\r\napproaching water, and in a few minutes they were close on it.  For the\r\nfirst time Dick felt alarm; he sought to check his steed, but no force\r\nhe could exert had the smallest influence on it.\r\n\r\nTrees and bushes flew past in bewildering confusion; the river was\r\nbefore him; what width, he could not tell, but he was reckless now, like\r\nhis charger, which he struck with the willow rod with all his force as\r\nthey came up.  One tremendous bound, and they were across, but Dick had\r\nto lie flat on the mustang's back as it crashed through the bushes to\r\navoid being scraped off by the trees.  Again they were on the open\r\nplain, and the wild horse began to show signs of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nNow was its rider's opportunity to assert his dominion.  He plied the\r\nwillow rod and urged the panting horse on, until it was white with foam\r\nand laboured a little in its gait.  Then Dick gently drew the halter,\r\nand it broke into a trot; still tighter--and it walked--and in another\r\nminute stood still, trembling in every limb.  Dick now quietly rubbed\r\nits neck, and spoke to it in soothing tones, then he wheeled it gently\r\nround and urged it forward.  It was quite subdued and docile.  In a\r\nlittle time they came to the river and forded it, after which they went\r\nthrough the belt of woodland at a walk.  By the time they reached the\r\nopen prairie, the mustang was recovered sufficiently to feel its spirit\r\nreturning, so Dick gave it a gentle touch with the switch, and away they\r\nwent on their return journey.\r\n\r\nBut it amazed Dick not a little to find how long that journey was.  Very\r\ndifferent was the pace, too, from the previous mad gallop, and often\r\nwould the poor horse have stopped had Dick allowed him.  But this might\r\nnot be.  The shades of night were approaching, and the camp lay a long\r\nway ahead.\r\n\r\nAt last it was reached, and Crusoe came out with great demonstrations of\r\njoy, but was sent back lest he should alarm the horse.  Then Dick jumped\r\noff his back, stroked his head, put his cheek close to his mouth, and\r\nwhispered softly to him, after which he fastened him to a tree and\r\nrubbed him down slightly with a bunch of grass.  Having done this, he\r\nleft him to graze as far as his tether would permit, and, after supping\r\nwith Crusoe, lay down to rest, not a little elated with his success in\r\nthis first attempt at \"creasing\" and \"breaking\" a mustang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nDICK BECOMES A HORSE TAMER--RESUMES HIS JOURNEY--CHARLIE'S DOINGS--\r\nMISFORTUNES WHICH LEAD TO, BUT DO NOT TERMINATE IN, THE ROCKY\r\nMOUNTAINS--A GRIZZLY BEAR.\r\n\r\nThere is a proverb--or a saying--or at least somebody or book has told\r\nus, that some Irishman once said--\"Be aisy, or, if ye can't be aisy, be\r\nas aisy as ye can.\"\r\n\r\nNow, we count that good advice, and strongly recommend it to all and\r\nsundry.  Had we been at the side of Dick Varley on the night after his\r\ntaming of the wild horse, we would have strongly urged that advice upon\r\nhim.  Whether he would have listened to it or not is quite another\r\nquestion--we rather think not.  Reader, if you wish to know why, go and\r\ndo what he did, and if you feel no curious sensations about the region\r\nof the loins after it, we will tell you why Dick Varley wouldn't have\r\nlistened to that advice.  Can a man feel as if his joints were wrenched\r\nout of their sockets, and listen to advice--be that advice good or bad?\r\nCan he feel as though these joints were trying to re-set and\r\nre-dislocate themselves perpetually--and listen to advice?  Can he feel\r\nas if he were sitting down on red-hot iron, when he's not sitting down\r\nat all--and listen to advice?  Can he--but no! why pursue the subject?\r\nPoor Dick spent that night in misery, and the greater part of the\r\nfollowing day in sleep, to make up for it.\r\n\r\nWhen he got up to breakfast in the afternoon, he felt much better, but\r\nshaky.\r\n\r\n\"Now, pup,\" he said, stretching himself, \"we'll go and see our horse.\r\n_Ours_, pup; yours and mine: didn't you help to catch him, eh! pup?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe acknowledged the fact with a wag, and a playful\r\n\"bow-wow-wow-oo-ow!\" and followed his master to the place where the\r\nhorse had been picketted.  It was standing there quite quiet, but\r\nlooking a little timid.\r\n\r\nDick went boldly up to it, and patted its head and stroked its nose, for\r\nnothing is so likely to alarm either a tame or a wild horse as any\r\nappearance of timidity or hesitation on the part of those who approach\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter treating it thus for a short time, he stroked down its neck, and\r\nthen its shoulders--the horse eyeing him all the time nervously.\r\nGradually he stroked its back and limbs gently, and walked quietly round\r\nand round it once or twice, sometimes approaching and sometimes going\r\naway, but never either hesitating or doing anything abruptly.  This\r\ndone, he went down to the stream and filled his cap with water and\r\ncarried it to the horse, which snuffed suspiciously and backed a little,\r\nso he laid the cap down, and went up and patted him again.  Presently he\r\ntook up the cap and carried it to his nose; the poor creature was almost\r\nchoking with thirst, so that, the moment he understood what was in the\r\ncap, he buried his lips in it and sucked it up.\r\n\r\nThis was a great point gained, he had accepted a benefit at the hands of\r\nhis new master; he had become a debtor to man, and no doubt he felt the\r\nobligation.  Dick filled the cap, and the horse emptied it again, and\r\nagain, and again, until its burning thirst was slaked.  Then Dick went\r\nup to his shoulder, patted him, undid the line that fastened him, and\r\nvaulted lightly on his back!\r\n\r\nWe say _lightly_, for it was so, but it wasn't _easily_, as Dick could\r\nhave told you!  However, he was determined not to forego the training of\r\nhis steed on account of what _he_ would have called a \"little bit pain.\"\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected act the horse plunged and reared a good deal, and\r\nseemed inclined to go through the performance of the day before over\r\nagain, but Dick patted and stroked him into quiescence, and having done\r\nso, urged him into a gallop over the plains, causing the dog to gambol\r\nround in order that he might get accustomed to him.  This tried his\r\nnerves a good deal, and no wonder, for if he took Crusoe for a wolf,\r\nwhich no doubt he did, he must have thought him a very giant of the\r\npack.\r\n\r\nBy degrees they broke into a furious gallop, and after breathing him\r\nwell, Dick returned and tied him to the tree.  Then he rubbed him down\r\nagain, and gave him another drink.  This time the horse smelt his new\r\nmaster all over, and Dick felt that he had conquered him by kindness.\r\nNo doubt the tremendous run of the day before could scarcely be called\r\nkindness, but without this subduing run he never could have brought the\r\noffices of kindness to bear on so wild a steed.\r\n\r\nDuring all these operations Crusoe sat looking on with demure sagacity--\r\ndrinking in wisdom and taking notes.  We know not whether any notes made\r\nby the canine race have ever been given to the world, but certain are we\r\nthat, if the notes and observations made by Crusoe on that journey were\r\npublished, they would--to say the least--surprise us!\r\n\r\nNext day Dick gave the wild horse his second lesson, and his name.  He\r\ncalled him \"Charlie,\" after a much loved companion in the Mustang\r\nValley.  And long and heartily did Dick Varley laugh as he told the\r\nhorse his future designation in the presence of Crusoe, for it struck\r\nhim as somewhat ludicrous that a mustang, which, two days ago, pawed the\r\nearth in all the pride of independent freedom, should suddenly come down\r\nso low as to carry a hunter on his back and be named Charlie!\r\n\r\nThe next piece of instruction began by Crusoe being led up under\r\nCharlie's nose, and while Dick patted the dog with his right hand he\r\npatted the horse with his left.  It backed a good deal at first and\r\nsnorted, but Crusoe walked slowly and quietly in front of him several\r\ntimes, each time coming nearer, until he again stood under his nose,\r\nthen the horse smelt him nervously, and gave a sigh of relief when he\r\nfound that Crusoe paid no attention to him whatever.  Dick then ordered\r\nthe dog to lie down at Charlie's feet, and went to the camp to fetch his\r\nrifle, and buffalo robe, and pack of meat.  These and all the other\r\nthings belonging to him were presented for inspection, one by one, to\r\nthe horse, who arched his neck, and put forward his ears, and eyed them\r\nat first, but smelt them all over, and seemed to feel more easy in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nNext, the buffalo robe was rubbed over his nose, then over his eyes and\r\nhead, then down his neck and shoulder, and lastly was placed on his\r\nback.  Then it was taken off and _flung_ on; after that it was strapped\r\non, and the various little items of the camp were attached to it.  This\r\ndone, Dick took up his rifle and let him smell it; then he put his hand\r\non Charlie's shoulder, vaulted on to his back, and rode away.\r\n\r\nCharlie's education was completed; and now our hero's journey began\r\nagain in earnest, and with some prospect of its speedy termination.\r\n\r\nIn this course of training through which Dick put his wild horse, he had\r\nbeen at much greater pains and had taken far longer time than is usually\r\nthe case among the Indians, who will catch, and \"break,\" and ride a wild\r\nhorse into camp in less than _three hours_.  But Dick wanted to do the\r\nthing well, which the Indians are not careful to do; besides, it must be\r\nborne in remembrance that this was his first attempt, and that his horse\r\nwas one of the best and most high spirited, while those caught by the\r\nIndians, as we have said, are generally the poorest of a drove.\r\n\r\nDick now followed the trail of his lost companions at a rapid pace, yet\r\nnot so rapidly as he might have done; being averse to exhausting his\r\ngood dog and his new companion.  Each night he encamped under the shade\r\nof a tree or a bush when he could find one, or in the open prairie when\r\nthere were none, and, picketting his horse to a short stake or pin which\r\nhe carried with him for the purpose, lit his fire, had supper, and lay\r\ndown to rest.  In a few days Charlie became so tame and so accustomed to\r\nhis master's voice that he seemed quite reconciled to his new life.\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that he had a great dislike to solitude,\r\nfor on one occasion, when Dick and Crusoe went off a mile or so from the\r\ncamp where Charlie was tied, and disappeared from his view, he was heard\r\nto neigh so loudly that Dick ran back thinking the wolves must have\r\nattacked him.  He was all right, however, and exhibited evident tokens\r\nof satisfaction when they returned.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion his fear of being left alone was more clearly\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nDick had been unable to find wood or water that day, so he was obliged\r\nto encamp upon the open plain.  The want of water was not seriously\r\nfelt, however, for he had prepared a bladder in which he always carried\r\nenough to give him one pannikin of hot syrup, and leave a mouthful for\r\nCrusoe and Charlie.  Dried buffalo dung formed a substitute for fuel.\r\nSpreading his buffalo robe, he lit his fire, put on his pannikin to\r\nboil, and stuck up a piece of meat to roast, to the great delight of\r\nCrusoe, who sat looking on with much interest.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Charlie, who was picketted a few hundred yards off in a grassy\r\nspot, broke his halter close by the head-piece, and with a snort of\r\ndelight bounded away, prancing and kicking up his heels!\r\n\r\nDick heaved a deep sigh, for he felt sure that his horse was gone.\r\nHowever, in a little Charlie stopped, and raised his nose high in the\r\nair, as if to look for his old equine companions.  But they were gone;\r\nno answering neigh replied to his; and he felt, probably for the first\r\ntime, that he was really alone in the world.  Having no power of smell,\r\nwhereby he might have traced them out as the dog would have done, he\r\nlooked in a bewildered and excited state all round the horizon.  Then\r\nhis eye fell on Dick and Crusoe sitting by their little fire.  Charlie\r\nlooked hard at them, and then again at the horizon; and then, coming to\r\nthe conclusion, no doubt, that the matter was quite beyond his\r\ncomprehension, he quietly took to feeding.\r\n\r\nDick availed himself of the chance, and tried to catch him; but he spent\r\nan hour with Crusoe in the vain attempt, and at last they gave it up in\r\ndisgust and returned to the fire, where they finished their supper and\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning they saw Charlie feeding close at hand; so they took\r\nbreakfast, and tried to catch him again.  But it was of no use; he was\r\nevidently coquetting with them, and dodged about and defied their utmost\r\nefforts, for there was only a few inches of line hanging to his head.\r\nAt last it occurred to Dick that he would try the experiment of\r\nforsaking him.  So he packed up his things, rolled up the buffalo robe,\r\nthrew it and the rifle on his shoulder, and walked deliberately away.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, Crusoe!\" he cried, after walking a few paces.\r\n\r\nBut Crusoe stood by the fire with his head up, and an expression on his\r\nface that said, \"Hello, man! what's wrong?  You've forgot Charlie!  Hold\r\non!  Are you mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Crusoe!\" cried his master in a decided tone.\r\n\r\nCrusoe obeyed at once.  Whatever mistake there might be, there was\r\nevidently none in that command; so he lowered his head and tail humbly,\r\nand trotted on with his master; but he perpetually turned his head as he\r\nwent, first on this side and then on that, to look and wonder at\r\nCharlie.\r\n\r\nWhen they were far away on the plain, Charlie suddenly became aware that\r\nsomething was wrong.  He trotted to the brow of a slope with his head\r\nand tail very high up indeed, and looked after them; then he looked at\r\nthe fire and neighed; then he trotted quickly up to it, and, seeing that\r\neverything was gone, he began to neigh violently, and at last started\r\noff at full speed, and overtook his friends, passing within a few feet\r\nof them, and wheeling round a few yards off, stood trembling like an\r\naspen leaf.\r\n\r\nDick called him by his name and advanced, while Charlie met him\r\nhalf-way, and allowed himself to be saddled, bridled, and mounted\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nAfter this Dick had no further trouble with his wild horse.\r\n\r\nAt his next camping-place, which was in the midst of a cluster of bushes\r\nclose beside a creek, Dick came unexpectedly upon a little wooden cross,\r\nwhich marked the head of a grave.  There was no inscription on it, but\r\nthe Christian symbol told that it was the grave of a white man.  It is\r\nimpossible to describe the rush of mingled feelings that filled the soul\r\nof the young hunter as he leaned on the muzzle of his rifle and looked\r\nat this solitary resting-place of one who, doubtless like himself, had\r\nbeen a roving hunter.  Had he been young or old when he fell?--had he a\r\nmother in the distant settlement, who watched, and longed, and waited\r\nfor the son that was never more to gladden her eyes?--had he been\r\nmurdered, or had he died there and been buried by his sorrowing\r\ncomrades?  These and a thousand questions passed rapidly through his\r\nmind as he gazed at the little cross.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started.  \"Could it be the grave of Joe or Henri?\"  For an\r\ninstant the idea sent a chill to his heart; but it passed quickly, for a\r\nsecond glance showed that the grave was old, and that the wooden cross\r\nhad stood over it for years.\r\n\r\nDick turned away with a saddened heart; and that night, as he pored over\r\nthe pages of his Bible, his mind was filled with many thoughts about\r\neternity and the world to come.  He, too, must come to the grave one\r\nday, and quit the beautiful prairies and his loved rifle.  It was a sad\r\nthought; but while he meditated he thought upon his mother.  \"After\r\nall,\" he murmured, \"there must be happiness _without_ the rifle, and\r\nyouth, and health, and the prairie!  My mother's happy, yet she don't\r\nshoot, or ride like wildfire over the plains.\"  Then that word which had\r\nbeen sent so sweetly to him through her hand came again to his mind, \"My\r\nson, give me thine heart;\" and as he read God's book, he met with the\r\nword, \"Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desire of\r\nthine heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _desire of thine heart_.\"  Dick repeated this, and pondered it till\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\nA misfortune soon after this befell Dick Varley, which well-nigh caused\r\nhim to give way to despair.  For some time past he had been approaching\r\nthe eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains--those ragged, jagged, mighty\r\nhills, which run through the whole continent from north to south in a\r\ncontinuous chain, and form, as it were, the backbone of America.  One\r\nmorning, as he threw the buffalo robe off his shoulders and sat up, he\r\nwas horrified to find the whole earth covered with a mantle of snow.  We\r\nsay he was horrified, for this rendered it absolutely impossible any\r\nfurther to trace his companions either by scent or sight.\r\n\r\nFor some time he sat musing bitterly on his sad fate, while his dog came\r\nand laid his head sympathisingly on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! pup,\" he said, \"I know ye'd help me if ye could!  But it's all up\r\nnow; there's no chance of findin' them--none.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Crusoe replied by a low whine.  He knew full well that something\r\ndistressed his master, but he hadn't yet ascertained what it was.  As\r\nsomething had to be done, Dick put the buffalo robe on his steed, and,\r\nmounting, said, as he was in the habit of doing each morning, \"Lead on,\r\npup.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe put his nose to the ground and ran forward a few paces, then he\r\nreturned and ran about snuffing and scraping up the snow.  At last he\r\nlooked up, and uttered a long melancholy howl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  I knowed it,\" said Dick, pushing forward.  \"Come on, pup, you'll\r\nhave to _follow_ now.  Any way we must go on.\"\r\n\r\nThe snow that had fallen was not deep enough to offer the slightest\r\nobstruction to their advance.  It was, indeed, only one of those\r\noccasional showers common to that part of the country in the late\r\nautumn, which season had now crept upon Dick almost before he was aware\r\nof it, and he fully expected that it would melt away in a few days.  In\r\nthis hope he kept steadily advancing, until he found himself in the\r\nmidst of those rocky fastnesses which divide the waters that flow into\r\nthe Atlantic from those that flow into the Pacific Ocean.  Still the\r\nslight crust of snow lay on the ground, and he had no means of knowing\r\nwhether he was going in the right direction or not.\r\n\r\nGame was abundant, and there was no lack of wood now, so that his night\r\nbivouac was not so cold or dreary as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nTravelling, however, had become difficult, and even dangerous, owing to\r\nthe rugged nature of the ground over which he proceeded.  The scenery\r\nhad completely changed in its character.  Dick no longer coursed over\r\nthe free, open plains, but he passed through beautiful valleys filled\r\nwith luxuriant trees, and hemmed in by stupendous mountains, whose\r\nrugged sides rose upward until the snow-clad peaks pierced the clouds.\r\n\r\nThere was something awful in these dark solitudes, quite overwhelming to\r\na youth of Dick's temperament; his heart began to sink lower and lower\r\nevery day, and the utter impossibility of making up his mind what to do\r\nbecame at length agonising.  To have turned and gone back the hundreds\r\nof miles over which he had travelled would have caused him some anxiety\r\nunder any circumstances, but to do so while Joe and Henri were either\r\nwandering about there or in the power of the savages, was, he felt, out\r\nof the question.  Yet, in which way should he go?  Whatever course he\r\ntook might lead him further and further away from them.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma he came to the determination of remaining where he was,\r\nat least until the snow should leave the ground.\r\n\r\nHe felt great relief even when this hopeless course was decided upon,\r\nand set about making himself an encampment with some degree of\r\ncheerfulness.  When he had completed this task, he took his rifle, and\r\nleaving Charlie picketted in the centre of a dell, where the long, rich\r\ngrass rose high above the snow, went off to hunt.\r\n\r\nOn turning a rocky point his heart suddenly bounded into his throat, for\r\nthere, not thirty yards distant, stood a huge grizzly bear!\r\n\r\nYes, there he was at last, the monster to meet which the young hunter\r\nhad so often longed,--the terrible size and fierceness of which he had\r\nheard so often spoken about by the old hunters.  There it stood at last;\r\nbut little did Dick Varley think that the first time he should meet with\r\nhis foe should be when alone in the dark recesses of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and with none to succour him in the event of the battle going\r\nagainst him.  Yes! there was one.  The faithful Crusoe stood by his\r\nside, with his hair bristling, all his formidable teeth exposed, and his\r\neyes glaring in their sockets.  Alas! for poor Crusoe, had he gone into\r\nthat combat alone.  One stroke of that monster's paw would have hurled\r\nhim dead upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nDICK'S FIRST FIGHT WITH A GRIZZLY--ADVENTURE WITH A DEER--A SURPRISE.\r\n\r\nThere is no animal in all the land so terrible and dangerous as the\r\ngrizzly bear.  Not only is he the largest of the species in America, but\r\nhe is the fiercest, the strongest, and the most tenacious of life, facts\r\nwhich are so well understood that few of the western hunters like to\r\nmeet him single-handed, unless they happen to be first-rate shots; and\r\nthe Indians deem the encounter so dangerous, that to wear a collar\r\ncomposed of the claws of a grizzly bear of his own killing, is counted\r\none of the highest honours to which a young warrior can attain.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly bear resembles the brown bear of Europe, but it is larger,\r\nand the hair is long, the points being of a paler shade.  About the head\r\nthere is a considerable mixture of grey hair, giving it the \"grizzly\"\r\nappearance, from which it derives its name.  The claws are dirty white,\r\narched, and very long, and so strong that when the animal strikes with\r\nits paw they cut like a chisel.  These claws are not embedded in the\r\npaw, as is the case with the cat, but always project far beyond the\r\nhair, thus giving to the foot a very ungainly appearance; they are not\r\nsufficiently curved to enable the grizzly bear to climb trees, like the\r\nblack and brown bears, and this inability on their part is often the\r\nonly hope of the pursued hunter, who, if he succeeds in ascending a\r\ntree, is safe, for the time at least, from the bear's assaults; but\r\n\"Caleb\" is a patient creature, and will often wait at the foot of the\r\ntree for many hours for his victim.\r\n\r\nThe average length of his body is about nine feet, but he sometimes\r\nattains to a still larger growth.  Caleb is more carnivorous in his\r\nhabits than other bears; but, like them, he does not object to indulge\r\noccasionally in vegetable diet, being partial to the bird-cherry, the\r\nchoke-berry, and various shrubs.  He has a sweet tooth, too, and revels\r\nin honey--when he can get it.\r\n\r\nThe instant the grizzly bear beheld Dick Varley standing in his path, he\r\nrose on his hind-legs, and made a loud hissing noise, like a man\r\nbreathing quick, but much harsher.  To this Crusoe replied by a deep\r\ngrowl, and showing the utmost extent of his teeth, gums and all; and\r\nDick cocked both barrels of his rifle.\r\n\r\nTo say that Dick Varley felt no fear would be simply to make him out\r\nthat sort of hero which does not exist in nature, namely a _perfect_\r\nhero.  He _did_ feel a sensation as if his bowels had suddenly melted\r\ninto water!  Let not our reader think the worse of Dick for this.  There\r\nis not a man living who, having met with a huge grizzly bear for the\r\nfirst time in his life, in a wild, solitary place, all alone, has not\r\nexperienced some such sensation.  There was no cowardice in this\r\nfeeling.  Fear is not cowardice.  Acting in a wrong and contemptible\r\nmanner because of our fear, is cowardice.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Wellington or Napoleon, we forget which, once stood\r\nwatching the muster of the men who were to form the forlorn hope in\r\nstorming a citadel.  There were many brave, strong, stalwart men there,\r\nin the prime of life, and flushed with the blood of high health and\r\ncourage.  There were also there a few stern-browed men of riper years,\r\nwho stood perfectly silent, with lips compressed, and as pale as death.\r\n\"Yonder veterans,\" said the general, pointing to these soldiers, \"are\r\nmen whose courage I can depend on; they _know_ what they are going to,\r\nthe others _don't_!\"  Yes, these young soldiers _very probably_ were\r\nbrave; the others _certainly_ were.\r\n\r\nDick Varley stood for a few seconds as if thunderstruck, while the bear\r\nstood hissing at him.  Then the liquefaction of his interior ceased, and\r\nhe felt a glow of fire gush through his veins.  Now, Dick knew well\r\nenough that to fly from a grizzly bear was the sure and certain way of\r\nbeing torn to pieces, as when taken thus by surprise they almost\r\ninvariably follow a retreating enemy.  He also knew that if he stood\r\nwhere he was, perfectly still, the bear would, get uncomfortable under\r\nhis stare, and would retreat from him.  But he neither intended to run\r\naway himself nor to allow the bear to do so; he intended to kill it, so\r\nhe raised his rifle quickly, \"drew a bead,\" as the hunters express it,\r\non the bear's heart, and fired.\r\n\r\nIt immediately dropped on its fore-legs and rushed at him.\r\n\r\n\"Back, Crusoe, out of the way, pup,\" shouted Dick, as his favourite was\r\nabout to spring forward.\r\n\r\nThe dog retired, and Dick leaped behind a tree.  As the bear passed he\r\ngave it the contents of the second barrel behind the shoulder, which\r\nbrought it down, but in another moment it rose and again rushed at him.\r\nDick had no time to load, neither had he time to spring up the thick\r\ntree beside which he stood, and the rocky nature of the ground out of\r\nwhich it grew rendered it impossible to dodge round it.  His only\r\nresource was flight; but where was he to fly to?  If he ran along the\r\nopen track, the bear would overtake him in a few seconds; on the right\r\nwas a sheer precipice, a hundred feet high; on the left was an\r\nimpenetrable thicket.  In despair he thought for an instant of clubbing\r\nhis rifle and meeting the monster in close conflict; but the utter\r\nhopelessness of such an effort was too apparent to be entertained for a\r\nmoment.  He glanced up at the overhanging cliffs.  There were one or two\r\nrents and projections close above him.  In the twinkling of an eye he\r\nsprang up and grasped a ledge of about an inch broad, ten or twelve feet\r\nup, to which he clung while he glanced upward.  Another projection was\r\nwithin reach,--he gained it, and in a few seconds he stood upon a ledge\r\nabout twenty feet up the cliff, where he had just room to plant his feet\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to look behind he seized his powder-horn and loaded one\r\nbarrel of his rifle; and well was it for him that his early training had\r\nfitted him to do this with rapidity, for the bear dashed up the\r\nprecipice after him at once.  The first time it missed its hold, and\r\nfell back with a savage growl, but, on the second attempt, it sunk its\r\nlong claws into the fissures between the rocks, and ascended steadily\r\ntill within a foot of the place where Dick stood.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Crusoe's obedience gave way before a sense of Dick's\r\ndanger.  Uttering one of his lion-like roars, he rushed up the precipice\r\nwith such violence that, although naturally unable to climb, he reached\r\nand seized the bear's flank, despite his master's stern order to \"keep\r\nback,\" and in a moment the two rolled down the face of the rock\r\ntogether, just as Dick completed loading.\r\n\r\nKnowing that one stroke of the bear's paw would be certain death to his\r\npoor dog, Dick leaped from his perch, and, with one bound reached the\r\nground at the same moment with the struggling animals, and close beside\r\nthem, and, before they had ceased rolling, he placed the muzzle of his\r\nrifle into the bear's ear, and blew out its brains.\r\n\r\nCrusoe, strange to say, escaped with only one scratch on the side.  It\r\nwas a deep one, but not dangerous, and gave him but little pain at the\r\ntime, although it caused him many a smart for some weeks after.\r\n\r\nThus happily ended Dick's first encounter with a grizzly bear; and\r\nalthough, in the course of his wild life he shot many specimens of\r\n\"Caleb,\" he used to say that \"he an' pup were never so near goin' under\r\nas on the day he dropped _that_ bar!\"\r\n\r\nHaving refreshed himself with a long draught from a neighbouring\r\nrivulet, and washed Crusoe's wound, Dick skinned the bear on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"We chawed him up that time, didn't we, pup?\" said Dick, with a smile of\r\nsatisfaction, as he surveyed his prize.\r\n\r\nCrusoe looked up and assented to this.\r\n\r\n\"Gave us a hard tussle, though; very nigh sent us both under, didn't he,\r\npup!\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe agreed entirely, and, as if the remark reminded him of honourable\r\nscars, he licked his wound.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, pup!\" cried Dick, sympathetically, \"does it hurt ye, eh, poor dog?\"\r\n\r\nHurt him! such a question!  No, he should think not; better ask if that\r\nleap from the precipice hurt yourself.\r\n\r\nSo Crusoe might have said, but he didn't; he took no notice of the\r\nremark whatever.\r\n\r\n\"We'll cut him up now, pup,\" continued Dick.  \"The skin 'll make a\r\nsplendid bed for you an me o' nights, and a saddle for Charlie.\"\r\n\r\nDick cut out all the claws of the bear by the roots, and spent the\r\nremainder of that night in cleaning them and stringing them on a strip\r\nof leather to form a necklace.  Independently of the value of these\r\nenormous claws (the largest as long as a man's middle finger) as an\r\nevidence of prowess, they formed a remarkably graceful collar, which\r\nDick wore round his neck ever after with as much pride as if he had been\r\na Pawnee warrior.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finished he held it out at arm's length, and said, \"Crusoe,\r\nmy pup, ain't ye proud of it?  I'll tell ye what it is, pup, the next\r\ntime you an' I floor Caleb, I'll put the claws round _your_ neck, an'\r\nmake ye wear 'em ever arter, so I will.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog did not seem quite to appreciate this piece of prospective good\r\nfortune.  Vanity had no place in his honest breast, and, sooth to say,\r\nit had not a large place in that of his master either, as we may well\r\ngrant when we consider that this first display of it was on the occasion\r\nof his hunter's soul having at last realised its brightest day-dream.\r\n\r\nDick's dangers and triumphs seemed to accumulate on him rather thickly\r\nat this place, for on the very next day he had a narrow escape of being\r\nkilled by a deer.  The way of it was this.\r\n\r\nHaving run short of meat, and not being particularly fond of grizzly\r\nbear steak, he shouldered his rifle and sallied forth in quest of game,\r\naccompanied by Crusoe, whose frequent glances towards his wounded side\r\nshowed that, whatever may have been the case the day before, it \"hurt\"\r\nhim now.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far when they came on the track of a deer in the snow,\r\nand followed it up till they spied a magnificent buck about three\r\nhundred yards off, standing in a level patch of ground which was\r\neverywhere surrounded either by rocks or thicket.  It was a long shot;\r\nbut as the nature of the ground rendered it impossible for Dick to get\r\nnearer without being seen, he fired, and wounded the buck so badly that\r\nhe came up with it in a few minutes.  The snow had drifted in the place\r\nwhere it stood bolt upright, ready for a spring, so Dick went round a\r\nlittle way, Crusoe following, till he was in a proper position to fire\r\nagain.  Just as he pulled the trigger, Crusoe gave a howl behind him,\r\nand disturbed his aim, so that he feared he had missed; but the deer\r\nfell, and he hurried towards it.  On coming up, however, the buck sprang\r\nto its legs, rushed at him with its hair bristling, knocked him down in\r\nthe snow, and deliberately commenced stamping him to death.\r\n\r\nDick was stunned for a moment, and lay quite still, so the deer left off\r\npommelling him, and stood looking at him.  But the instant he moved it\r\nplunged at him again and gave him another pounding, until he was content\r\nto lie still.  This was done several times, and Dick felt his strength\r\ngoing fast.  He was surprised that Crusoe did not come to his rescue,\r\nand once he cleared his mouth and whistled to him; but as the deer gave\r\nhim another pounding for this, he didn't attempt it again.  He now for\r\nthe first time bethought him of his knife, and quietly drew it from his\r\nbelt; but the deer observed the motion, and was on him again in a\r\nmoment.  Dick, however, sprang up on his left elbow, and, making several\r\ndesperate thrusts upward, succeeded in stabbing the animal to the heart.\r\n\r\nRising and shaking the snow from his garments, he whistled loudly to\r\nCrusoe, and, on listening, heard him whining piteously.  He hurried to\r\nthe place whence the sound came, and found that the poor dog had fallen\r\ninto a deep pit or crevice in the rocks, which had been concealed from\r\nview by a crust of snow, and he was now making frantic but unavailing\r\nefforts to leap out.\r\n\r\nDick soon freed him from his prison by means of his belt, which he let\r\ndown for the dog to grasp, and then returned to camp with as much\r\ndeer-meat as he could carry.  Dear meat it certainly was to him, for it\r\nhad nearly cost him his life, and left him all black and blue for weeks\r\nafter.  Happily no bones were broken, so the incident only confined him\r\na day to his encampment.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the snow fell thicker than ever, and it became evident\r\nthat an unusually early winter was about to set in among the mountains.\r\nThis was a terrible calamity, for, if the regular snow of winter set in,\r\nit would be impossible for him either to advance or retreat.\r\n\r\nWhile he was sitting on his bear-skin by the campfire one day, thinking\r\nanxiously what he should do, and feeling that he must either make the\r\nattempt to escape, or perish miserably in that secluded spot, a strange,\r\nunwonted sound struck upon his ear, and caused both him and Crusoe to\r\nspring violently to their feet and listen.  Could he be dreaming? it\r\nseemed like the sound of human voices.  For a moment he stood with his\r\neyes rivetted on the ground, his lips apart and his nostrils distended,\r\nas he listened with the utmost intensity.  Then he darted out and\r\nbounded round the edge of a rock which concealed an extensive but narrow\r\nvalley from his view, and there, to his amazement, he beheld a band of\r\nabout a hundred human beings advancing on horseback slowly through the\r\nsnow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE AND A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS--THE FUR-TRADERS--CRUSOE PROVED, AND\r\nTHE PEIGANS PURSUED.\r\n\r\nDick's first and most natural impulse, on beholding this band, was to\r\nmount his horse and fly, for his mind naturally enough recurred to the\r\nformer rough treatment he had experienced at the hands of Indians.  On\r\nsecond thoughts, however, he considered it wiser to throw himself upon\r\nthe hospitality of the strangers; \"for,\" thought he, \"they can but kill\r\nme, an' if I remain here I'm like to die at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nSo Dick mounted his wild horse, grasped his rifle in his right hand,\r\nand, followed by Crusoe, galloped full tilt down the valley to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe had heard enough of the customs of savage tribes, and had also of\r\nlate experienced enough, to convince him that when a man found himself\r\nin the midst of an overwhelming force, his best policy was to assume an\r\nair of confident courage.  He therefore approached them at his utmost\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the advancing band was electrical; and little wonder,\r\nfor the young hunter's appearance was very striking.  His horse, from\r\nhaving rested a good deal of late, was full of spirit; its neck was\r\narched, its nostrils expanded, and its mane and tail, never having been\r\nchecked in their growth, flew wildly around him in voluminous curls.\r\nDick's own hair, not having been clipped for many months, appeared\r\nscarcely less wild as they thundered down the rocky pass at what\r\nappeared a break-neck gallop.  Add to this the grandeur of the scene out\r\nof which they sprang, and the gigantic dog that bounded by his side, and\r\nyou will not be surprised to hear that the Indian warriors clustered\r\ntogether, and prepared to receive this bold horseman as if he, in his\r\nown proper person, were a complete squadron of cavalry.  It is probable,\r\nalso, that they fully expected the tribe of which Dick was the chief to\r\nbe at his heels.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near the excitement among the strangers seemed very great,\r\nand, from the peculiarity of the various cries that reached him, he knew\r\nthat there were women and children in the band--a fact which, in such a\r\nplace and at such a season, was so unnatural, that it surprised him very\r\nmuch.  He noted also that, though the men in front were Indians, their\r\ndresses were those of trappers and hunters, and he almost leaped out of\r\nhis saddle when he observed that \"_Pale-faces_\" were among them.  But he\r\nhad barely time to note these facts when he was up with the band.\r\nAccording to Indian custom, he did not check his speed till he was\r\nwithin four or five yards of the advance-guard, who stood in a line\r\nbefore him, quite still, and with their rifles lying loosely in their\r\nleft palms; then he reined his steed almost on _its_ haunches.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians advanced and spoke a few words in a language which\r\nwas quite unintelligible to Dick, who replied, in the little Pawnee he\r\ncould muster, that he didn't understand him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you must be a trapper!\" exclaimed a thick-set, middle-aged man,\r\nriding out from the group.  \"Can you speak English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that can I,\" cried Dick, joyfully, riding up and shaking the\r\nstranger heartily by the hand; \"an' right glad am I to fall in wi' a\r\nwhite-skin an' a civil tongue in his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good sooth, sir,\" replied the stranger, with a quiet smile on his kind,\r\nweather-beaten face, \"I can return you the compliment, for when I saw\r\nyou come thundering down the corrie with that wonderful horse and no\r\nless wonderful dog of yours, I thought you were the wild man o' the\r\nmountain himself, and had an ambush ready to back you.  But, young man,\r\ndo you mean to say that you live here in the mountain all alone after\r\nthis fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that I don't.  I've comed here in my travels; but, truly, this\r\nbean't my home.  But, sir (for I see you are what the fur-traders call a\r\nbourgeois), how comes it that such a band as this rides i' the\r\nmountains!  D'ye mean to say that _they_ live here?\"  Dick looked round\r\nin surprise, as he spoke, upon the crowd of mounted men and women, with\r\nchildren and pack-horses, that now surrounded him.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a fair question, lad.  I am a principal among the fur-traders\r\nwhose chief trading-post lies near the Pacific Ocean, on the west side\r\nof these mountains, and I have come with these trappers and their\r\nfamilies, as you see, to hunt the beaver and other animals for a season\r\nin the mountains.  We've never been here before; but that's a matter of\r\nlittle moment, for it's not the first time I've been on what may be\r\ncalled a discovery-trading expedition.  We are somewhat entangled,\r\nhowever, just now, among these wild passes, and, if you can guide us out\r\nof our difficulties to the east side of the mountains, I'll thank you\r\nheartily and pay you well.  But first tell me who and what you are, if\r\nit's a fair question.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Dick Varley, and my home's in the Mustang Valley, near the\r\nMissouri river.  As to _what_ I am--I'm nothin' yet, but I hope to\r\ndesarve the name o' a hunter some day.  I can guide you to the east side\r\no' the mountains, for I've comed from there; but more than that I can't\r\ndo, for I'm a stranger to the country here, like yourself.  But you're\r\non the east side o' the mountains already, if I mistake not; only these\r\nmountains are so rugged and jumbled up, that it's not easy tellin' where\r\nye are.  And what,\" continued Dick, \"may be the name o' the bourgeois\r\nwho speaks to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Cameron--Walter Cameron--a well-known name among the\r\nScottish hills, although it sounds a little strange here.  And now,\r\nyoung man, will you join my party as guide, and afterwards remain as\r\ntrapper?  It will pay you better, I think, than roving about alone.\"\r\n\r\nDick shook his head and looked grave.  \"I'll guide you,\" said he, \"as\r\nfar as my knowledge 'll help me; but after that I must return to look\r\nfor two comrades whom I have lost.  They have been driven into the\r\nmountains by a band of Injuns.  God grant they may not have bin\r\nscalped.\"\r\n\r\nThe trader's face looked troubled, and he spoke with one of his Indians\r\nfor a few minutes in earnest, hurried tones.\r\n\r\n\"What were they like, young man?\"\r\n\r\nDick described them.\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" continued the trader; \"they've been seen, lad, not more than\r\ntwo days ago, by this Indian here, when he was out hunting alone some\r\nmiles away from our camp.  He came suddenly on a band of Indians, who\r\nhad two prisoners with them, such as you describe.  They were stout,\r\nsaid you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, both of them,\" cried Dick, listening with intense eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Ay.  They were tied to their horses, an' from what I know of these\r\nfellows I'm sure they're doomed.  But I'll help you, my friend, as well\r\nas I can.  They can't be far from this.  I treated my Indian's story\r\nabout them as a mere fabrication, for he's the most notorious liar in my\r\ncompany; but he seems to have spoken truth for once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, thanks, good sir,\" cried Dick.  \"Had we not best turn back and\r\nfollow them at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, friend, not quite so fast,\" replied Cameron, pointing to his\r\npeople.  \"These must be provided for first, but I shall be ready before\r\nthe sun goes down.  And now, as I presume you don't bivouac in the snow,\r\nwill you kindly conduct us to your encampment, if it be not far hence?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough burning with impatience to fly to the rescue of his friends,\r\nDick felt constrained to comply with so reasonable a request, so he led\r\nthe way to his camping-place, where the band of fur-traders immediately\r\nbegan to pitch their tents, cut down wood, kindle fires, fill their\r\nkettles with water, cook their food, and, in fact, make themselves\r\ncomfortable.  The wild spot which, an hour before, had been so still,\r\nand grand, and gloomy, was now, as if by magic, transformed into a\r\nbustling village, with bright fires blazing among the rocks and bushes,\r\nand merry voices of men, women, and children ringing in the air.  It\r\nseemed almost incredible, and no wonder Dick, in his bewilderment, had\r\ndifficulty in believing it was not all a dream.\r\n\r\nIn days long gone by the fur-trade in that country was carried on in a\r\nvery different way from the manner in which it is now conducted.  These\r\nwild regions, indeed, are still as lonesome and untenanted (save by wild\r\nbeasts and wandering tribes of Indians), as they were then; but the\r\nIndians of the present day have become accustomed to the \"pale-faced\"\r\ntrader, whose little wooden forts or trading-posts are dotted here and\r\nthere, at wide intervals, all over the land.  But in the days of which\r\nwe write it was not so.  The fur-traders at that time went forth in\r\narmed bands into the heart of the Indians' country, and he who went\r\nforth did so \"with his life in his hand.\"  As in the case of the soldier\r\nwho went out to battle, there was great probability that he might never\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe band of which Walter Cameron was the chief had, many months before,\r\nstarted from one of the distant posts of Oregon on a hunting expedition\r\ninto the then totally unknown lands of the Snake Indians.  It consisted\r\nof about sixty men, thirty women, and as many children of various\r\nages,--about a hundred and twenty souls in all.  Many of the boys were\r\ncapable of using the gun and setting a beaver-trap.  The men were a most\r\nmotley set.  There were Canadians, half-breeds, Iroquois, and Scotchmen.\r\nMost of the women had Indian blood in their veins, and a few were pure\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of this strange band consisted of upwards of two hundred\r\nbeaver-traps--which are similar to our rat-traps, with this difference,\r\nthat they have two springs and no teeth--seventy guns, a few articles\r\nfor trade with the Indians, and a large supply of powder and ball; the\r\nwhole--men, women, children, goods, and chattels--being carried on the\r\nbacks of nearly four hundred horses.  Many of these horses, at starting,\r\nwere not laden, being designed for the transport of furs that were to be\r\ntaken in the course of the season.\r\n\r\nFor food this adventurous party depended entirely on their guns, and\r\nduring the march hunters were kept constantly out ahead.  As a matter of\r\ncourse their living was precarious.  Sometimes their kettles were\r\noverflowing; at others they scarce refrained from eating their horses.\r\nBut, during the months they had already spent in the wilderness, good\r\nliving had been the rule, starvation the exception.  They had already\r\ncollected a large quantity of beaver-skins, which at that time were\r\namong the most valuable in the market, although they are now scarcely\r\nsaleable!\r\n\r\nHaving shot two wild horses, seven elks, six small deer, and four\r\nbig-horned sheep, the day before they met Dick Varley, the camp-kettles\r\nwere full, and the people consequently happy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Master Dick Varley,\" said Cameron, touching the young hunter on\r\nthe shoulder as he stood ready equipped by one of the campfires; \"I'm at\r\nyour service.  The people won't need any more looking after to-night.\r\nI'll divide my men--thirty shall go after this rascally band of Peigans,\r\nfor such I believe they are, and thirty shall remain to guard the camp.\r\nAre you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready! ay, this hour past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mount then, lad; the men have already been told off and are mustering\r\ndown yonder where the deer gave you such a licking.\"\r\n\r\nDick needed no second bidding.  He vaulted on Charlie's back and along\r\nwith their commander joined the men, who were thirty as fine, hardy,\r\nreckless-looking fellows as one could desire for a forlorn hope.  They\r\nwere chatting and laughing while they examined their guns and saddle\r\ngirths.  Their horses were sorry-looking animals compared with the\r\nmagnificent creature that Dick bestrode, but they were hardy,\r\nnevertheless, and well fitted for their peculiar work.\r\n\r\n\"My! wot a blazer,\" exclaimed a trapper as Dick rode up.\r\n\r\n\"Where you git him?\" inquired a half-breed.\r\n\r\n\"I caught him,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Baw!\" cried the first speaker.\r\n\r\nDick took no notice of this last remark.\r\n\r\n\"No, did ye though?\" he asked again.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" answered Dick, quietly; \"I creased him in the prairie--you can\r\nsee the mark on his neck if you look.\"\r\n\r\nThe men began to feel that the young hunter was perhaps a little beyond\r\nthem at their own trade, and regarded him with increased respect.\r\n\r\n\"Look sharp now, lads,\" said Cameron, impatiently, to several dilatory\r\nmembers of the band.  \"Night will be on us ere long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who sold ye the bear-claw collar?\" inquired another man of Dick.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't buy it.  I killed the bear and made it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did ye, though, all be yer lone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that wasn't much, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've begun well, yonker,\" said a tall middle-aged hunter, whose\r\ngeneral appearance was not unlike that of Joe Blunt.  \"Jest keep clear\r\no' the Injuns an' the grog bottle an' ye've a glor'ous life before ye.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the conversation was interrupted by the order being given\r\nto move on, which was obeyed in silence, and the cavalcade, descending\r\nthe valley, entered one of the gorges in the mountains.\r\n\r\nFor the first half mile Cameron rode a little ahead of his men, then he\r\nturned to speak to one of them and for the first time observed Crusoe\r\ntrotting close beside his master's horse.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Master Dick,\" he exclaimed with a troubled expression, \"that won't\r\ndo.  It would never do to take a dog on an expedition like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Dick, \"the pup's quiet and peaceable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it not, but he will betray our presence to the Indians, which\r\nmight be inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've travelled more than a thousand miles through prairie and forest,\r\namong game an' among Injuns, an' the pup never betrayed me yet,\" said\r\nDick, with suppressed vehemence; \"he has saved my life more than once\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have perfect confidence in your dog, but as this is a\r\nserious matter you must not expect me to share in it without proof of\r\nhis trustworthiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pup may be useful to us; how would you have it proved?\" inquired\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n\"Any way you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forgot your belt at starting, I think I heered ye say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" replied the trader, smiling.\r\n\r\nDick immediately took hold of Cameron's coat, and bade Crusoe smell it,\r\nwhich the dog did very carefully.  Then he showed him his own belt and\r\nsaid: \"Go back to the camp and fetch it, pup.\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe was off in a moment, and in less than twenty minutes returned\r\nwith Cameron's belt in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll trust him,\" said Cameron, patting Crusoe's head.  \"Forward,\r\nlads!\" and away they went at a brisk trot along the bottom of a\r\nbeautiful valley on each side of which the mountains towered in dark\r\nmasses.  Soon the moon rose and afforded light sufficient to enable them\r\nto travel all night in the track of the Indian hunter who said he had\r\nseen the Peigans, and who was constituted guide to the party.  Hour\r\nafter hour the horsemen pressed on without check, now galloping over a\r\nlevel plain, now bounding by the banks of a rivulet, or bending their\r\nheads to escape the boughs of overhanging trees, and anon toiling slowly\r\nup among the rocks of some narrow defile.  At last the moon set, and the\r\norder was given to halt in a little plain where there was wood and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe horses were picketted, a fire kindled, a mouthful of dried meat\r\nhastily eaten, the watch was set, and then each man scraped away the\r\nsnow, spread some branches on the ground, and, wrapping himself in his\r\nblanket, went to sleep with his feet presented towards the fire.\r\n\r\nTwo hours were allowed for rest; then they were awakened, and in a few\r\nminutes were off again by the grey light of dawn.  In this way they\r\ntravelled two nights and a day.  At the end of that time they came\r\nsuddenly on a small party of nine Indians who were seated on the ground\r\nwith their snow-shoes and blankets by their sides.  They had evidently\r\nbeen taken by surprise, but they made no attempt to escape, knowing that\r\nit was useless.  Each sat still with his bow and arrows between his legs\r\non the ground ready for instant use.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cameron spoke, however, in their own language they felt\r\nrelieved and began to talk.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from, and what are you doing here?\" asked the trader.\r\n\r\n\"We have come to trade with the white men,\" one of them replied, \"and to\r\nhunt.  We have come from the Missouri.  Our country is far away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do Peigans hunt with _war-arrows_?\" asked Cameron, pointing to their\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nThis question seemed to perplex them, for they saw that their\r\ninterrogator knew the difference between a war and a hunting arrow--the\r\nformer being barbed in order to render its extraction from the wound\r\ndifficult, while the head of the latter is round and can be drawn out of\r\ngame that has been killed, and used again.\r\n\r\n\"And do Peigans,\" continued Cameron, \"come from a far country to trade\r\nwith the white men _with nothing_?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Indians were silent, for they had not an article of trade\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nCameron now felt convinced that this party of Peigans, into whose hands\r\nJoe Blunt and Henri had fallen, were nothing else than a war-party, and\r\nthat the men now before him were a scouting-party sent out from them,\r\nprobably to spy out his own camp, on the trail of which they had fallen,\r\nso he said to them--\r\n\r\n\"The Peigans are not wise men, they tell lies to the traders.  I will\r\ntell you that you are a war-party, and that you are only a few warriors\r\nsent out to spy the traders' camp.  You have also two _Pale-face_\r\nprisoners in your camp.  You cannot deceive me.  It is useless to try.\r\nNow, conduct me to your camp.  My object is not war; it is peace.  I\r\nwill speak with your chiefs about trading with the white men, and we\r\nwill smoke the pipe of peace.  Are my words good?\"\r\n\r\nDespite their proverbial control of muscle, these Indians could not\r\nconceal their astonishment at hearing so much of their affairs thus laid\r\nbare, so they said that the Pale-face chief was wise, that he must be a\r\ngreat medicine-man, and that what he said was all true except about the\r\nwhite men.  They had never seen any Pale-faces, and knew nothing\r\nwhatever about those he spoke of.\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible piece of news to poor Dick, and at first his heart\r\nfairly sank within him, but by degrees he came to be more hopeful.  He\r\nconcluded that if these men told lies in regard to one thing they would\r\ndo it in regard to another, and perhaps they might have some strong\r\nreason for denying any knowledge of Joe and Henri.\r\n\r\nThe Indians now packed up the buffalo robes on which they had slept, and\r\nthe mouthful of provisions they had taken with them.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word of what they say about your friends,\" said\r\nCameron to Dick in a low tone while the Indians were thus engaged.\r\n\"Depend upon it they hope to hide them till they can send to the\r\nsettlements and get a ransom, or till they get an opportunity of\r\ntorturing them to death before their women and children when they get\r\nback to their own village.  But we'll baulk them, my friend, do not\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were soon ready to start, for they were lumbered with\r\nmarvellously little camp equipage.  In less than half an hour after\r\ntheir discovery they were running like deer ahead of the cavalcade in\r\nthe direction of the Peigan camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nADVENTURES WITH THE PEIGANS--CRUSOE DOES GOOD SERVICE AS A DISCOVERER--\r\nTHE SAVAGES OUTWITTED--THE RESCUE.\r\n\r\nA run of twenty miles brought the travellers to a rugged defile in the\r\nmountains, from which they had a view of a beautiful valley of\r\nconsiderable extent.  During the last two days a steady thaw had been\r\nrapidly melting away the snow, so that it appeared only here and there\r\nin the landscape in dazzling patches.  At the distance of about half a\r\nmile from where they halted to breathe the horses before commencing the\r\ndescent into this vale, several thin wreaths of smoke were seen rising\r\nabove the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your camp?\" inquired Cameron, riding up to the Indian runners\r\nwho stood in a group in front, looking as fresh after their twenty\r\nmiles' run as though they had only had a short walk.\r\n\r\nTo this they answered in the affirmative, adding that there were about\r\ntwo hundred Peigans there.\r\n\r\nIt might have been thought that thirty men would have hesitated to\r\nventure to attack so large a number as two hundred; but it had always\r\nbeen found in the experience of Indian life, that a few resolute white\r\nmen well armed were more than a match for ten times their number of\r\nIndians.  And this arose not so much from the superior strength or\r\nagility of the whites over their red foes, as from that bull-dog courage\r\nand utter recklessness of their lives in combat,--qualities which the\r\ncrafty savage can neither imitate nor understand.  The information was\r\nreceived with perfect indifference by most of the trappers, and with\r\ncontemptuous laughter by some, for a large number of Cameron's men were\r\nwild, evil-disposed fellows, who would have as gladly taken the life of\r\nan Indian as a buffalo.\r\n\r\nJust as the word was given to resume the march, Dick Varley rode up to\r\nCameron, and said in a somewhat anxious tone--\"D'ye obsarve, sir, that\r\none o' the Red-skins has gone off ahead o' his comrades?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that, Master Dick, and it was a mistake of mine not to have\r\nstopped him, but he was gone too far before I observed it, and I thought\r\nit better to appear unconcerned.  We must push on, though, and give him\r\nas short time as possible to talk with his comrades in the camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe trappers pressed forward accordingly at a gallop, and were soon in\r\nfront of the clump of trees amongst which the Peigans were encamped.\r\nTheir approach had evidently spread great alarm among them, for there\r\nwas a good deal of bustle and running to and fro, but by the time the\r\ntrappers had dismounted and advanced in a body on foot, the savages had\r\nresumed their usual quiet dignity of appearance, and were seated calmly\r\nround their fires with their bows and arrows beside them.  There were no\r\ntents, no women or children, and the general aspect of the men showed\r\nCameron conclusively that his surmise about their being a war-party was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nA council was immediately called; the trappers ranged themselves on one\r\nside of the council-fire and the Indians on the other.  Meanwhile, our\r\nfriend Crusoe had been displaying considerable irritability against the\r\nIndians, and he would certainly have attacked the whole two hundred\r\nsingle-handed if he had not been ordered by his master to lie still, but\r\nnever in his life before had Crusoe obeyed with such a bad grace.  He\r\nbristled and whined in a low tremulous tone, and looked imploringly at\r\nDick as if for permission to fly at them.\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-faced traders are glad to meet with the Peigans,\" began\r\nCameron, who determined to make no allusion to his knowledge that they\r\nwere a war-party, \"for they wish to be friends with all the children of\r\nthe woods and prairies.  They wish to trade with them; to exchange\r\nblankets, and guns, and beads, and other goods which the Peigans\r\nrequire, for furs of animals which the Pale-faces require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" exclaimed the Indians; which expression might be translated,\r\n\"Hear, hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Cameron, \"we wish to have no war.  We wish to see the\r\nhatchet buried, and to see all the Red-men and the white men smoking the\r\npipe of peace, and hunting like brothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Ho-ho-ing\" at this was very emphatic.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" resumed the trader, \"the Peigans have got two prisoners--two\r\nPale-faces--in their camp, and, as we cannot be on good terms while our\r\nbrothers are detained, we have come to ask for them, and to _present\r\nsome gifts_ to the Peigans.\"\r\n\r\nTo this there was no \"Ho\" at all, but a prolonged silence, which was at\r\nlength interrupted by a tall chief stepping forward to address the\r\ntrappers.\r\n\r\n\"What the Pale-face chief has said is good,\" began the Indian.  \"His\r\nwords are wise, and his heart is not double.  The Red-men are willing to\r\nsmoke the pipe of peace, and to hunt with all men as brothers, but they\r\ncannot do it while many of their scalps are hanging in the lodges of\r\ntheir enemies and fringing the robes of the warriors.  The Peigans must\r\nhave vengeance; then they will make peace.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause he continued--\"The chief is wrong when he says there\r\nare Pale-faces in the Peigan camp.  The Peigans are not at war with the\r\nPale-faces; neither have they seen any on their march.  The camp is\r\nopen.  Let the Pale-faces look round and see that what we say is true.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief waved his hand towards his warriors as he concluded, as if to\r\nsay, \"Search amongst them.  There are no Pale-faces there.\"\r\n\r\nCameron now spoke to Dick in a low tone.  \"They speak confidently,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and I fear greatly that your poor comrades have either been\r\nkilled or conveyed away from the camp and hidden among the mountains, in\r\nwhich case, even though they should not be far off, it would be next to\r\nimpossible to find them, especially when such a band o' rascals is near,\r\ncompelling us to keep together.  But I'll try what a little tempting\r\nthem with goods will do.  At any rate we shan't give in without a\r\nscuffle.\"\r\n\r\nIt now, for the first time, flashed across Dick Varley that there was\r\nsomething more than he imagined in Crusoe's restless anxiety, which had\r\nnot in the least abated, and the idea of making use of him now occurred\r\nto his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I've a notion that I'll settle this matter in a shorter time than you\r\nthink,\" he said hurriedly, \"if you'll agree to try what _threatening_\r\nwill do.\"\r\n\r\nThe trader looked grave and undecided.  \"I never resort to that except\r\nas a last hope,\" he answered, \"but I've a good deal of confidence in\r\nyour prudence, what would you advise?\"\r\n\r\nDick and the trader whispered a few minutes together, while some of the\r\nmen, in order to show the Indians how perfectly unconcerned they were,\r\nand how ready for _anything_, took out their pipes and began to smoke.\r\nBoth parties were seated on the ground, and during this interval the\r\nIndians also held eager discussion.\r\n\r\nAt length Cameron stood up, and said to his men in a quiet tone, \"Be\r\nready, lads, for instant action; when I give the word `Up,' spring to\r\nyour feet and cock your guns, but _don't fire a shot till you get the\r\nword_.\"  He then stepped forward and said--\r\n\r\n\"The Peigan warriors are double-tongued; they know that they have hid\r\nthe Pale-face prisoners.  We do not wish to quarrel, but if they are not\r\ndelivered up at once, the Pale-faces and the Peigans will not be\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this the Indian chief again stood forward and said, \"The Peigans\r\nare _not_ double-tongued.  They have not seen Pale-faces till to-day.\r\nThey can say no more.\"\r\n\r\nWithout moving hand or foot, Cameron then said in a firm tone, \"The\r\nfirst Peigan that moves shall die!  Up, lads, and ready!\"\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye the trappers sprang to their feet, and\r\ncocking their rifles stood perfectly motionless, scowling at the\r\nsavages, who were completely taken by surprise at the unusual suddenness\r\nand informality of such a declaration of war.  Not a man moved, for,\r\nunlike white men, they seldom risk their lives in open fight; and as\r\nthey looked at the formidable row of muzzles that waited but a word to\r\nsend instant death into their midst, they felt that discretion was at\r\nthat time the better part of valour.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Cameron, while Dick Varley and Crusoe stepped up beside him,\r\n\"my young warrior will search for the Pale-face prisoners.  If they are\r\nfound, we will take them and go away.  If they are not found, we will\r\nask the Peigans to forgive us, and will give them gifts.  But in the\r\nmeantime, if a Peigan moves from the spot where he sits, or lifts a bow,\r\nmy young men shall fire, and the Peigans know that the rifle of the\r\nPale-face always kills.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Dick immediately said, \"Seek 'em out,\r\npup,\" and Crusoe bounded away.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes he sprang hither and thither through the camp, quite\r\nregardless of the Indians, and snuffed the air several times, whining in\r\nan excited tone, as if to relieve his feelings.  Then he put his nose to\r\nthe ground and ran straight forward into the woods.  Dick immediately\r\nbounded after him like a deer, while the trappers kept silent guard over\r\nthe savages.\r\n\r\nFor some time Crusoe ran straight forward.  Then he came to a spot where\r\nthere was a good deal of drifted snow on the ground.  Here he seemed to\r\nlose the trail for a little, and ran about in all directions, whining in\r\na most piteous tone.\r\n\r\n\"Seek 'em out, pup,\" repeated Dick encouragingly, while his own breast\r\nheaved with excitement and expectation.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the dog resumed its onward course, and led the way into\r\na wild, dark spot, which was so overshadowed by trees and precipitous\r\ncliffs that the light of the sun scarce found entrance.  There were many\r\nhuge masses of rock scattered over the ground, which had fallen from the\r\ncliffs.  Behind one of these lay a mound of dried leaves, towards which\r\nCrusoe darted and commenced scraping violently.\r\n\r\nTrembling with dread that he should find this to be the grave of his\r\nmurdered companions, Dick rushed forward and hastily cleared away the\r\nleaves.  The first handful thrown off revealed part of the figure of a\r\nman.  Dick's heart beat audibly as he cleared the leaves from the face,\r\nand he uttered a suppressed cry on beholding the well-known features of\r\nJoe Blunt!  But they were not those of a dead man.  Joe's eyes met his\r\nwith a scowl of anger, which instantly gave place to one of intense\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Joe Blunt!\" exclaimed Dick in a voice of intense amazement, while\r\nCrusoe sniffed round the heap of leaves, and whined with excitement.\r\nBut Joe did not move, neither did he speak a word in reply--for the very\r\ngood reasons that his mouth was tightly bound with a band of leather,\r\nhis hands and feet were tied, and his whole body was secured in a rigid,\r\nimmovable position by being bound to a pole of about his own length.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Dick's knife was out, bands and cords were severed, and Joe\r\nBlunt was free.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" exclaimed Joe with a deep, earnest sigh, the instant his\r\nlips were loosened, \"and thanks to _you_, lad,\" he added, endeavouring\r\nto rise, but his limbs had become so benumbed in consequence of the\r\ncords by which they had been compressed that for some time he could not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\"I'll rub ye, Joe--I'll soon rub ye into a right state,\" said Dick,\r\ngoing down on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, lad, look sharp and dig up Henri.  He's just beside me here.\"\r\n\r\nDick immediately rose, and, pushing aside the heap of leaves, found\r\nHenri securely bound in the same fashion.  But he could scarce refrain\r\nfrom laughing at the expression of that worthy's face.  Hearing the\r\nvoices of Joe and Dick Varley in conversation, though unable to see\r\ntheir persons, he was filled with such unbounded amazement that his\r\neyes, when uncovered, were found to be at their largest possible\r\nstretch, and as for the eyebrows, they were gone, utterly lost among the\r\nroots of his voluminous hair.\r\n\r\n\"Henri, friend, I knew I should find ye,\" said Dick, cutting the thongs\r\nthat bound him.  \"Get up if ye can, we haven't much time to lose, an'\r\nmayhap we'll have to fight afore we're done wi' the Red-skins.  Can ye\r\nrise?\"\r\n\r\nHenri could do nothing but lie on his back and gasp, \"Eh! possible! mon\r\nfrere!  Oh, non, non, _not_ possible.  Oui! my broder Deek!\"\r\n\r\nHere he attempted to rise, but, being unable, fell back again, and the\r\nwhole thing came so suddenly, and made so deep an impression on his\r\nimpulsive mind, that he incontinently burst into tears; then he burst\r\ninto a long laugh.  Suddenly he paused, and, scrambling up to a sitting\r\nposture, looked earnestly into Dick's face through his tearful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, non, non!\" he exclaimed, stretching himself out at full length\r\nagain, and closing his eyes; \"it are too goot to be true.  I am dream.\r\nI vill wait till I am wake.\"\r\n\r\nDick roused him out of this resolute sleep, however, somewhat roughly.\r\nMeanwhile Joe had rubbed and kicked himself into a state of animation,\r\nexclaiming that he felt as if he wos walkin' on a thousand needles and\r\npins, and in a few minutes they were ready to accompany their overjoyed\r\ndeliverer back to the Peigan camp.  Crusoe testified his delight in\r\nvarious elephantine gambols round the persons of his old friends, who\r\nwere not slow to acknowledge his services.\r\n\r\n\"They haven't treated us overly well,\" remarked Joe Blunt, as they\r\nstrode through the underwood.\r\n\r\n\"Non, de rascale, vraiment, de am villains.  Oui!  How de have talk,\r\ntoo, 'bout--oh-o-oo-ooo-wah!--roastin' us alive, an' puttin' our scalp\r\nin de vigvam for de poopoose to play wid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, niver mind, Henri, we'll be quits wi' them now,\" said Joe, as\r\nthey came in sight of the two bands, who remained in precisely the same\r\nposition in which they had been left, except that one or two of the more\r\nreckless of the trappers had lit their pipes and taken to smoking,\r\nwithout, however, laying down their rifles or taking their eyes off the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nA loud cheer greeted the arrival of the prisoners, and looks of\r\nconsiderable discomfort began to be evinced by the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you, friends,\" said Cameron, as they came up.\r\n\r\n\"Ve is 'appy ov de same,\" replied Henri, swaggering up in the joviality\r\nof his heart, and seizing the trader's hand in his own enormous fist.\r\n\"Shall ve go to york an' slay dem all at vonce, or von at a time?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll consider that afterwards, my lad.  Meantime go you to the rear,\r\nand get a weapon of some sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui.  Ah! c'est charmant,\" he cried, going with an immense flounder\r\ninto the midst of the amused trappers, and slapping those next to him on\r\nthe back.  \"Give me veapon, do, mes ami--gun, pistol, anyting--cannon,\r\nif you have von.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cameron and Joe spoke together for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\"You had goods with you, and horses, I believe, when you were captured,\"\r\nsaid the former.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that we had.  Yonder stand the horses under the pine-tree, along\r\nwi' the rest o' the Red-skin troop, an a hard time they've had o't, as\r\ntheir bones may tell without speakin'.  As for the goods,\" he continued,\r\nglancing round the camp, \"I don't know where--ah! yes, there they be in\r\nthe old pack.  I see all safe.\"\r\n\r\nCameron now addressed the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"The Peigans,\" he said, \"have not done well.  Their hearts have not been\r\ntrue to the Pale-faces.  Even now I could take your scalps where you\r\nsit; but white men do not like war, they do not like revenge.  The\r\nPeigans may go free.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering the fewness of their numbers, this was bold language to use\r\ntowards the Indians; but the boldest is generally the best policy on\r\nsuch occasions.  Moreover, Cameron felt that, being armed with rifles,\r\nwhile the Indians had only bows and arrows, the trappers had a great\r\nadvantage over them.\r\n\r\nThe Indian who had spoken before now rose and said he was sorry there\r\nshould be any cause of difference between them, and added he was sorry\r\nfor a great many more things besides, but he did not say he was sorry\r\nfor having told a lie.\r\n\r\n\"But, before you go, you must deliver up the horses and goods belonging\r\nto these men,\" said Cameron pointing to Joe and Henri.\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to.  The horses were led out, the two little packs\r\ncontaining Joe's goods were strapped upon them, and then the trappers\r\nturned to depart.  The Indians did not move until they had mounted; then\r\nthey rose and advanced in a body to the edge of the wood, to see the\r\nPale-faces go away.  Meanwhile Joe spoke a few words to Cameron, and the\r\nmen were ordered to halt, while the former dismounted and led his horse\r\ntowards the band of savages.\r\n\r\n\"Peigans,\" he said, \"you know the object for which I came into this\r\ncountry was to make peace between you and the Pale-faces.  I have often\r\ntold you so when you would not listen, and when you told me that I had a\r\ndouble heart, and told lies.  You were wrong when you said this; but I\r\ndo not wonder, for you live among nations who do not fear God, and who\r\nthink it right to lie.  I now repeat to you what I said before.  It\r\nwould be good for the Red-men if they would make peace with the\r\nPale-faces, and if they would make peace with each other.  I will now\r\nconvince you that I am in earnest, and have all along been speaking the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\nHereupon Joe Blunt opened his bundle of goods, and presented fully\r\none-half of the gaudy and brilliant contents to the astonished Indians,\r\nwho seemed quite taken aback by such generous treatment.  The result of\r\nthis was that the two parties separated with mutual expressions of\r\nesteem and good will.  The Indians then returned to the forest, and the\r\nwhite men galloped back to their camp among the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nNEW PLANS--OUR TRAVELLERS JOIN THE FUR-TRADERS, AND SEE MANY STRANGE\r\nTHINGS--A CURIOUS FIGHT--A NARROW ESCAPE, AND A PRISONER TAKEN.\r\n\r\nNot long after the events related in the last chapter, our four friends,\r\nDick, and Joe, and Henri, and Crusoe, agreed to become for a time\r\nmembers of Walter Cameron's band of trappers.  Joe joined because one of\r\nthe objects which the traders had in view was similar to his own\r\nmission, namely, the promoting of peace among the various Indian tribes\r\nof the mountains and plains to the west.  Joe, therefore, thought it a\r\ngood opportunity of travelling with a band of men who could secure him a\r\nfavourable hearing from the Indian tribes they might chance to meet with\r\nin the course of their wanderings.  Besides, as the traders carried\r\nabout a large supply of goods with them, he could easily replenish his\r\nown nearly exhausted pack by hunting wild animals and exchanging their\r\nskins for such articles as he might require.\r\n\r\nDick joined because it afforded him an opportunity of seeing the wild,\r\nmajestic scenery of the Rocky Mountains, and shooting the big-horned\r\nsheep which abounded there, and the grizzly \"bars,\" as Joe named them,\r\nor \"Caleb,\" as they were more frequently styled by Henri and the other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHenri joined because it was agreeable to the inclination of his own\r\nrollicking, blundering, floundering, crashing disposition, and because\r\nhe would have joined anything that had been joined by the other two.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's reason for joining was single, simple, easy to be expressed,\r\neasy to be understood, and commendable.  _He_ joined--because Dick did.\r\n\r\nThe very day after the party left the encampment where Dick had shot the\r\ngrizzly bear and the deer, he had the satisfaction of bringing down a\r\nsplendid specimen of the big-horned sheep.  It came suddenly out from a\r\ngorge of the mountain, and stood upon the giddy edge of a tremendous\r\nprecipice, at a distance of about two hundred and fifty yards.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ could not hit that,\" said a trapper to Henri, who was rather fond\r\nof jeering him about his short-sightedness.\r\n\r\n\"Non!\" cried Henri, who didn't see the animal in the least; \"say you\r\ndat? ve shall see;\" and he let fly with a promptitude that amazed his\r\ncomrades, and with a result that drew from them peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you have missed the mountain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, non! dat am eempossoble.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true, nevertheless, for his ball had been arrested in its flight\r\nby the stem of a tree not twenty yards before him.\r\n\r\nWhile the shot was yet ringing, and before the laugh above referred to\r\nhad pealed forth, Dick Varley fired, and the animal, springing wildly\r\ninto the air, fell down the precipice, and was almost dashed to pieces\r\nat their feet.\r\n\r\nThis Rocky Mountain or big-horned sheep was a particularly large and\r\nfine one, but, being a patriarch of the flock, was not well suited for\r\nfood.  It was considerably larger in size than the domestic sheep, and\r\nmight be described as somewhat resembling a deer in the body and a ram\r\nin the head.  Its horns were the chief point of interest to Dick; and,\r\ntruly, they were astounding!  Their enormous size was out of all\r\nproportion to the animal's body, and they curved backwards and\r\ndownwards, and then curled up again in a sharp point.  These creatures\r\nfrequent the inaccessible heights of the Rocky Mountains, and are\r\ndifficult to approach.  They have a great fondness for salt, and pay\r\nregular visits to the numerous caverns of these mountains, which are\r\nencrusted with a saline substance.\r\n\r\nWalter Cameron now changed his intention of proceeding to the eastward,\r\nas he found the country not so full of beaver at that particular spot as\r\nhe had anticipated.  He therefore turned towards the west, penetrated\r\ninto the interior of the mountains, and took a considerable sweep\r\nthrough the lovely valleys on their western slopes.\r\n\r\nThe expedition which this enterprising fur-trader was conducting was one\r\nof the first that ever penetrated these wild regions in search of furs.\r\nThe ground over which they travelled was quite new to them, and having\r\nno guide they just moved about at haphazard, encamping on the margin of\r\nevery stream or river on which signs of the presence of beaver were\r\ndiscovered, and setting their traps.\r\n\r\nBeaver-skins at this time were worth 25 shillings a piece in the markets\r\nof civilised lands, and in the Snake country, through which our friends\r\nwere travelling, thousands of them were to be had from the Indians for\r\ntrinkets and baubles that were scarce worth a farthing.  A beaver-skin\r\ncould be procured from the Indians for a brass finger ring or a penny\r\nlooking-glass.  Horses were also so numerous that one could be procured\r\nfor an axe or a knife.\r\n\r\nLet not the reader, however, hastily conclude that the traders cheated\r\nthe Indians in this traffic, though the profits were so enormous.  The\r\nring or the axe was indeed a trifle to the trader, but the beaver-skin\r\nand the horse were equally trifles to the savage, who could procure as\r\nmany of them as he chose with very little trouble, while the ring and\r\nthe axe were in his estimation of priceless value.  Besides, be it\r\nremembered, to carry that ring and that axe to the far distant haunts of\r\nthe Red-man cost the trader weeks and months of constant toil, trouble,\r\nanxiety, and, alas! too frequently cost him his life!  The state of\r\ntrade is considerably modified in these regions at the present day.  It\r\nis not more _justly_ conducted, for, in respect of the value of goods\r\ngiven for furs, it was justly conducted _then_, but time and\r\ncircumstances have tended more to equalise the relative values of\r\narticles of trade.\r\n\r\nThe snow which had prematurely fallen had passed away, and the trappers\r\nnow found themselves wandering about in a country so beautiful and a\r\nseason so delightful, that it would have seemed to them a perfect\r\nparadise, but for the savage tribes who hovered about them, and kept\r\nthem ever on the _qui vive_.\r\n\r\nThey soon passed from the immediate embrace of stupendous heights and\r\ndark gorges to a land of sloping ridges, which divided the country into\r\na hundred luxuriant vales, composed part of woodland and part of\r\nprairie.  Through these numerous rivers and streams flowed deviously,\r\nbeautifying the landscape and enriching the land.  There were also many\r\nlakes of all sizes, and these swarmed with fish, while in some of them\r\nwere found the much-sought-after and highly esteemed beaver.  Salt\r\nsprings and hot springs of various temperatures abounded here, and many\r\nof the latter were so hot that meat could be boiled in them.  Salt\r\nexisted in all directions in abundance, and of good quality.  A\r\nsulphurous spring was also discovered, bubbling out from the base of a\r\nperpendicular rock three hundred feet high, the waters of which were\r\ndark-blue, and tasted like gunpowder.  In short, the land presented\r\nevery variety of feature calculated to charm the imagination and delight\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a mysterious land, too, for broad rivers burst in many places\r\nfrom the earth, flowed on a short space, and then disappeared as if by\r\nmagic into the earth from which they rose.  Natural bridges spanned the\r\ntorrents in many places, and some of these were so correctly formed that\r\nit was difficult to believe they had not been built by the hand of man.\r\nThey often appeared opportunely to our trappers, and saved them the\r\ntrouble and danger of fording rivers.  Frequently the whole band would\r\nstop in silent wonder and awe as they listened to the rushing of waters\r\nunder their feet, as if another world of streams, and rapids, and\r\ncataracts were flowing below the crust of earth on which they stood.\r\nSome considerable streams were likewise observed to gush from the faces\r\nof precipices, some twenty or thirty feet from their summits, while on\r\nthe top no water was to be seen.\r\n\r\nWild berries of all kinds were found in abundance, and wild vegetables,\r\nbesides many nutritious roots.  Among other fish splendid salmon were\r\nfound in the lakes and rivers; and animal life swarmed on hill and dale.\r\nWoods and valleys, plains, and ravines, teemed with it.  On every plain\r\nthe red-deer grazed in herds by the banks of lake and stream; wherever\r\nthere were clusters of poplar and elder-trees and saplings, the beaver\r\nwas seen nibbling industriously with his sharp teeth, and committing as\r\nmuch havoc in the forests as if they had been armed with the woodman's\r\naxe; otters sported in the eddies; racoons sat in the tree-tops; the\r\nmarten, the black fox, and the wolf, prowled in the woods in quest of\r\nprey; mountain sheep and goats browsed on the rocky ridges, and badgers\r\npeeped from their holes.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the wild horse sprang snorting and dishevelled from his\r\nmountain retreats--with flourishing mane and tail, spanking step, and\r\nquestioning gaze,--and thundered away over the plains and valleys, while\r\nthe rocks echoed back his shrill neigh.  The huge, heavy, ungainly elk,\r\nor moose-deer, _trotted_ away from the travellers with speed equal to\r\nthat of the mustang.  Elks seldom gallop; their best speed is attained\r\nat the trot.  Bears, too, black, and brown, and grizzly, roamed about\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nSo numerous were all these creatures, that on one occasion the hunters\r\nof the party brought in six wild horses, three bears, four elks, and\r\nthirty red-deer; having shot them all a short distance ahead of the main\r\nbody, and almost without diverging from the line of march.  And this was\r\na matter of every-day occurrence--as it had need to be, considering the\r\nnumber of mouths that had to be filled.\r\n\r\nThe feathered tribes were not less numerous.  Chief among these were\r\neagles and vultures of uncommon size, the wild goose, wild duck, and the\r\nmajestic swan.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such profusion the trappers spent a happy time of it,\r\nwhen not molested by the savages, but they frequently lost a horse or\r\ntwo in consequence of the expertness of these thievish fellows.  They\r\noften wandered, however, for days at a time without seeing an Indian,\r\nand at such times they enjoyed to the full the luxuries with which a\r\nbountiful God had blessed these romantic regions.\r\n\r\nDick Varley was almost wild with delight.  It was his first excursion\r\ninto the remote wilderness; he was young, healthy, strong, and romantic;\r\nand it is a question whether his or his dog's heart, or that of the\r\nnoble wild horse he bestrode, bounded most with joy at the glorious\r\nsights, and sounds, and influences by which they were surrounded.  It\r\nwould have been perfection had it not been for the frequent annoyance\r\nand alarms caused by the Indians.\r\n\r\nAlas! alas! that we who write and read about those wondrous scenes\r\nshould have to condemn our own species as the most degraded of all the\r\nworks of the Creator there!  Yet so it is.  Man, exercising his reason\r\nand conscience in the path of love and duty which his Creator points\r\nout, is God's noblest work; but man, left to the freedom of his own\r\nfallen will, sinks morally lower than the beasts that perish.  Well may\r\nevery Christian wish and pray that the name and the gospel of the\r\nblessed Jesus may be sent speedily to the dark places of the earth; for\r\nyou may read of, and talk about, but you _cannot conceive_ the fiendish\r\nwickedness and cruelty which causes tearless eyes to glare, and maddened\r\nhearts to burst, in the lands of the heathen.\r\n\r\nWhile we are on this subject let us add (and our young readers will come\r\nto know it if they are spared to see many years) that _civilisation_\r\nalone will never improve the heart.  Let history speak and it will tell\r\nyou that deeds of darkest hue have been perpetrated in so-called\r\ncivilised, though pagan lands.  Civilisation is like the polish that\r\nbeautifies inferior furniture, which water will wash off if it be but\r\n_hot enough_.  Christianity resembles dye, which permeates every fibre\r\nof the fabric, and which nothing can eradicate.\r\n\r\nThe success of the trappers in procuring beaver here was great.  In all\r\nsorts of creeks and rivers they were found.  One day they came to one of\r\nthe curious rivers before mentioned, which burst suddenly out of a\r\nplain, flowed on for several miles, and then disappeared into the earth\r\nas suddenly as it had risen.  Even in this strange place beaver were\r\nseen, so the traps were set, and a hundred and fifty were caught at the\r\nfirst lift.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the party proceeded was as follows: They marched in\r\na mass in groups or in a long line, according to the nature of the\r\nground over which they travelled.  The hunters of the party went forward\r\na mile or two in advance, and scattered through the woods.  After them\r\ncame the advance-guard, being the bravest and most stalwart of the men\r\nmounted on their best steeds, and with rifle in hand; immediately behind\r\nfollowed the women and children, also mounted, and the pack-horses with\r\nthe goods and camp equipage.  Another band of trappers formed the\r\nrear-guard to this imposing cavalcade.  There was no strict regimental\r\norder kept, but the people soon came to adopt the arrangements that were\r\nmost convenient for all parties, and at length fell naturally into their\r\nplaces in the line of march.\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt usually was the foremost and always the most successful of the\r\nhunters.  He was therefore seldom seen on the march except at the hour\r\nof starting, and at night when he came back leading his horse, which\r\nalways groaned under its heavy load of meat, Henri, being a hearty,\r\njovial soul and fond of society, usually kept with the main body.  As\r\nfor Dick, he was everywhere at once, at least as much so as it is\r\npossible for human nature to be!  His horse never wearied; it seemed to\r\ndelight in going at full speed; no other horse in the troop could come\r\nnear Charlie, and Dick indulged him by appearing now at the front, now\r\nat the rear, anon in the centre, and frequently _nowhere_!--having gone\r\noff with Crusoe, like a flash of lightning, after a buffalo or a deer.\r\nDick soon proved himself to be the best hunter of the party, and it was\r\nnot long before he fulfilled his promise to Crusoe, and decorated his\r\nneck with a collar of grizzly bear claws.\r\n\r\nWell, when the trappers came to a river where there were signs of\r\nbeaver, they called a halt, and proceeded to select a safe and\r\nconvenient spot, near wood and water, for the camp.  Here the property\r\nof the band was securely piled in such a manner as to form a breastwork\r\nor slight fortification, and here Walter Cameron established\r\nhead-quarters.  This was always the post of danger, being exposed to\r\nsudden attack by prowling savages, who often dogged the footsteps of the\r\nparty in their journeyings to see what they could steal.  But Cameron\r\nwas an old hand, and they found it difficult to escape his vigilant eye.\r\n\r\nFrom this point all the trappers were sent forth in small parties every\r\nmorning in various directions, some on foot and some on horseback,\r\naccording to the distances they had to go; but they never went further\r\nthan twenty miles, as they had to return to camp every evening.\r\n\r\nEach trapper had ten steel traps allowed him.  These he set every night,\r\nand visited every morning, sometimes oftener, when practicable,\r\nselecting a spot in the stream where many trees had been cut down by\r\nbeavers for the purpose of damming up the water.  In some places as many\r\nas fifty tree stumps were seen in one spot, within the compass of half\r\nan acre, all cut through at about eighteen inches from the root.  We may\r\nremark, in passing, that the beaver is very much like a gigantic\r\nwater-rat, with this marked difference, that its tail is very broad and\r\nflat like a paddle.  The said tail is a greatly esteemed article of\r\nfood, as, indeed, is the whole body at certain seasons of the year.  The\r\nbeaver's fore-legs are very small and short, and it uses its paws as\r\nhands to convey food to its mouth, sitting the while in an erect\r\nposition on its hind-legs and tail.  Its fur is a dense coat of a\r\ngreyish-coloured down, concealed by long coarse hair, which lies smooth,\r\nand is of a bright chestnut colour.  Its teeth and jaws are of enormous\r\npower; with them it can cut through the branch of a tree as thick as a\r\nwalking-stick at one snap; and, as we have said, it gnaws through thick\r\ntrees themselves.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a tree falls, the beavers set to work industriously to lop\r\noff the branches, which, as well as the smaller trunks, they cut into\r\nlengths, according to their weight and thickness.  These are then\r\ndragged by main force to the water side, launched, and floated to their\r\ndestination.  Beavers build their houses, or \"lodges,\" under the banks\r\nof rivers and lakes, and always select those of such depth of water that\r\nthere is no danger of their being frozen to the bottom; when such cannot\r\nbe found, and they are compelled to build in small rivulets of\r\ninsufficient depth, these clever little creatures dam up the waters\r\nuntil they are deep enough.  The banks thrown up by them across rivulets\r\nfor this purpose are of great strength, and would do credit to human\r\nengineers.  Their \"lodges\" are built of sticks, mud, and stones, which\r\nform a compact mass; this freezes solid in winter, and defies the\r\nassaults of that house-breaker, the wolverine, an animal which is the\r\nbeaver's implacable foe.  From this \"lodge,\" which is capable often of\r\nholding four old and six or eight young ones, a communication is\r\nmaintained with the water below the ice, so that, should the wolverine\r\nsucceed in breaking up the lodge, he finds the family \"not at home,\"\r\nthey having made good their retreat by the back-door.  When man acts the\r\npart of house-breaker, however, he cunningly shuts the back-door\r\n_first_, by driving stakes through the ice, and thus stopping the\r\npassage.  Then he enters, and, we almost regret to say, finds the family\r\nat home.  We regret it, because the beaver is a gentle, peaceable,\r\naffectionate, hairy little creature, towards which one feels an\r\nirresistible tenderness!  But, to return from this long digression.\r\n\r\nOur trappers having selected their several localities, set their traps\r\nin the water, so that when the beavers roamed about at night, they put\r\ntheir feet into them, and were caught and drowned; for, although they\r\ncan swim and dive admirably, they cannot live altogether under water.\r\n\r\nThus the different parties proceeded, and in the mornings the camp was a\r\nbusy scene indeed, for then the whole were engaged in skinning the\r\nanimals.  The beavers thus taken were always skinned, stretched, dried,\r\nfolded up with the hair in the inside, laid by, and the flesh used for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nBut oftentimes the trappers had to go forth with the gun in one hand and\r\ntheir traps in the other, while they kept a sharp look out on the bushes\r\nto guard against surprise.  Despite their utmost efforts a horse was\r\noccasionally stolen before their very eyes, and sometimes even an\r\nunfortunate trapper was murdered, and all his traps carried off.\r\n\r\nAn event of this kind occurred soon after the party had gained the\r\nwestern slopes of the mountains.  Three Iroquois Indians, who belonged\r\nto the band of trappers, were sent to a stream about ten miles off.\r\nHaving reached their destination, they all entered the water to set\r\ntheir traps, foolishly neglecting the usual precaution of one remaining\r\non the bank to protect the others.  They had scarcely commenced\r\noperations, when three arrows were discharged into their backs, and a\r\nparty of Snake Indians rushed upon and slew them, carrying away their\r\ntraps, and horses, and scalps.  This was not known for several days,\r\nwhen, becoming anxious about their prolonged absence, Cameron sent out a\r\nparty which found their mangled bodies affording a loathsome banquet to\r\nthe wolves and vultures.\r\n\r\nAfter this sad event the trappers were more careful to go in larger\r\nparties, and keep watch.\r\n\r\nAs long as beaver were taken in abundance the camp remained stationary,\r\nbut whenever the beaver began to grow scarce, the camp was raised, and\r\nthe party moved on to another valley.\r\n\r\nOne day Dick Varley came galloping into camp with the news that there\r\nwere several bears in a valley not far distant, which he was anxious not\r\nto disturb until a number of the trappers were collected together to go\r\nout and surround them.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the information Walter Cameron shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We have other things to do, young man,\" said he, \"than go a-hunting\r\nafter bears.  I'm just about making up my mind to send off a party to\r\nsearch out the valley on the other side of the Blue Mountains yonder,\r\nand bring back word if there are beaver there, for if not, I mean to\r\nstrike away direct south.  Now, if you've a mind to go with them, you're\r\nwelcome.  I'll warrant you'll find enough in the way of bear-hunting to\r\nsatisfy you; perhaps a little Indian hunting to boot, for if the\r\nBanattees get hold of your horses, you'll have a long hunt before you\r\nfind them again.  Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, right gladly,\" replied Dick.  \"When do we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nDick went off at once to his own part of the camp to replenish his\r\npowder-horn and bullet pouch, and wipe out his rifle.\r\n\r\nThat evening the party, under command of a Canadian named Pierre, set\r\nout for the Blue Hills.  They numbered twenty men, and expected to be\r\nabsent three days, for they merely went to reconnoitre, not to trap.\r\nNeither Joe nor Henri were of this party, both having been out hunting\r\nwhen it was organised.  But Crusoe and Charlie were, of course!\r\n\r\nPierre, although a brave and trusty man, was of a sour, angry\r\ndisposition, and not a favourite with Dick, but the latter resolved to\r\nenjoy himself and disregard his sulky comrade.  Being so well mounted,\r\nhe not unfrequently shot far ahead of his companions, despite their\r\nwarnings that he ran great risk by so doing.  On one of these occasions\r\nhe and Crusoe witnessed a very singular fight, which is worthy of\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nDick had felt a little wilder in spirit that morning than usual, and on\r\ncoming to a pretty open plain he gave the rein to Charlie, and with an\r\n\"_Adieu mes comerades_,\" he was out of sight in a few minutes.  He rode\r\non several miles in advance without checking speed, and then came to a\r\nwood where rapid motion was inconvenient, so he pulled up, and,\r\ndismounting, tied Charlie to a tree, while he sauntered on a short way\r\non foot.\r\n\r\nOn coming to the edge of a small plain he observed two large birds\r\nengaged in mortal conflict.  Crusoe observed them too, and would soon\r\nhave put an end to the fight had Dick not checked him.  Creeping as\r\nclose to the belligerents as possible, he found that one was a wild\r\nturkey-cock, the other a white-headed eagle!  These two stood with their\r\nheads down and all their feathers bristling for a moment, then they\r\ndashed at each other, and struck fiercely with their spurs as our\r\ndomestic cocks do, but neither fell, and the fight was continued for\r\nabout five minutes without apparent advantage on either side.\r\n\r\nDick now observed that, from the uncertainty of its motions, the\r\nturkey-cock was blind, a discovery which caused a throb of compunction\r\nto enter his breast for standing and looking on, so he ran forward.  The\r\neagle saw him instantly, and tried to fly away, but was unable from\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"At him, Crusoe,\" cried Dick, whose sympathies all lay with the other\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nCrusoe went forward at a bound, and was met by a peck between the eyes\r\nthat would have turned most dogs, but Crusoe only winked, and the next\r\nmoment the eagle's career was ended.\r\n\r\nDick found that the turkey-cock was quite blind, the eagle having thrust\r\nout both its eyes, so, in mercy, he put an end to its sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe fight had evidently been a long and severe one for the grass all\r\nround the spot, for about twenty yards, was beaten to the ground, and\r\ncovered with the blood and feathers of the fierce combatants.\r\n\r\nMeditating on the fight which he had just witnessed, Dick returned\r\ntowards the spot where he had left Charlie, when he suddenly missed\r\nCrusoe from his side.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Crusoe! here, pup, where are you?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe only answer to this was a sharp whizzing sound, and an arrow,\r\npassing close to his ear, quivered in a tree beyond.  Almost at the same\r\nmoment Crusoe's angry roar was followed by a shriek from some one in\r\nfear or agony.  Cocking his rifle, the young hunter sprang through the\r\nbushes towards his horse, and was just in time to save a Banattee Indian\r\nfrom being strangled by the dog.  It had evidently scented out this\r\nfellow, and pinned him just as he was in the act of springing on the\r\nback of Charlie, for the halter was cut, and the savage lay on the\r\nground close beside him.\r\n\r\nDick called off the dog, and motioned to the Indian to rise, which he\r\ndid so nimbly that it was quite evident he had sustained no injury\r\nbeyond the laceration of his neck by Crusoe's teeth, and the surprise.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall strong Indian, for the tribe to which he belonged, so Dick\r\nproceeded to secure him at once.  Pointing to his rifle and to the\r\nIndian's breast, to show what he might expect if he attempted to escape,\r\nDick ordered Crusoe to keep him steady in that position.\r\n\r\nThe dog planted himself in front of the savage, who began to tremble for\r\nhis scalp, and gazed up in his face with a look which, to say the least\r\nof it, was the reverse of amiable, while Dick went towards his horse for\r\nthe purpose of procuring a piece of cord to tie him with.  The Indian\r\nnaturally turned his head to see what was going to be done, but a\r\npeculiar _gurgle_ in Crusoe's throat made him turn it round again very\r\nsmartly, and he did not venture, thereafter, to move a muscle.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds Dick returned with a piece of leather and tied his\r\nhands behind his back.  While this was being done the Indian glanced\r\nseveral times at his bow, which lay a few feet away, where it had fallen\r\nwhen the dog caught him, but Crusoe seemed to understand him, for he\r\nfavoured him with such an additional display of teeth, and such a low--\r\napparently distant, almost, we might say, subterranean--_rumble_, that\r\nhe resigned himself to his fate.\r\n\r\nHis hands secured, a long line was attached to his neck with a running\r\nnoose, so that if he ventured to run away the attempt would effect its\r\nown cure by producing strangulation.  The other end of this line was\r\ngiven to Crusoe, who at the word of command marched him off, while Dick\r\nmounted Charlie and brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nGreat was the laughter and merriment when this apparition met the eyes\r\nof the trappers; but when they heard that he had attempted to shoot Dick\r\ntheir ire was raised, and a court-martial was held on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"Hang the reptile!\" cried one.\r\n\r\n\"Burn him!\" shouted another.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said a third; \"don't imitate them villains; don't be cruel.\r\nLet's shoot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot 'im,\" cried Pierre; \"Oui, dat is de ting; it too goot pour lui,\r\nmais, it shall be dooed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye think, lads, it would be better to let the poor wretch off?\"\r\nsaid Dick Varley; \"he'd p'raps give a good account o' us to his people.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a universal shout of contempt at this mild proposal.\r\nUnfortunately, few of the men sent on this exploring expedition were\r\nimbued with the peacemaking spirit of their chief; and most of them\r\nseemed glad to have a chance of venting their hatred of the poor Indians\r\non this unhappy wretch, who although calm, looked sharply from one\r\nspeaker to another, to gather hope, if possible, from the tones of their\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nDick was resolved at the risk of a quarrel with Pierre to save the poor\r\nman's life, and had made up his mind to insist on having him conducted\r\nto the camp to be tried by Cameron, when one of the men suggested that\r\nthey should take the savage to the top of a hill about three miles\r\nfurther on, and there hang him up on a tree as a warning to all his\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed, agreed,\" cried the men; \"come on.\"\r\n\r\nDick, too, seemed to agree to this proposal, and hastily ordered Crusoe\r\nto run on ahead with the savage, an order which the dog obeyed so\r\nvigorously that before the men had done laughing at him, he was a couple\r\nof hundred yards ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\"Take care that he don't get off!\" cried Dick, springing on Charlie and\r\nstretching out at a gallop.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he was beside the Indian.  Scraping together the little of\r\nthe Indian language he knew, he stooped down, and, cutting the thongs\r\nthat bound him, said--\"Go, white men love the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThe man cast on his deliverer one glance of surprise, and the next\r\nmoment bounded aside into the bushes and was gone.\r\n\r\nA loud shout from the party behind showed that this act had been\r\nobserved, and Crusoe stood with the end of the line in his mouth, and an\r\nexpression on his face that said, \"You're absolutely incomprehensible,\r\nDick!  It's all right, I _know_; but to my feeble capacity it _seems_\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fat for, you do dat?\" shouted Pierre in a rage, as he came up with a\r\nmenacing look.\r\n\r\nDick confronted him.  \"The prisoner was mine.  I had a right to do with\r\nhim as it liked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" cried several of the men who had begun to repent of their\r\nresolution, and were glad the savage was off.  \"The lad's right.  Get\r\nalong, Pierre.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had no right, you vas wrong.  Oui, et I have goot vill to give you\r\none knock on de nose.\"\r\n\r\nDick looked Pierre in the face, as he said this, in a manner that cowed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"It is time,\" he said quietly, pointing to the sun, \"to go on.  Your\r\nbourgeois expects that time won't be wasted.\"\r\n\r\nPierre muttered something in an angry tone, and, wheeling round his\r\nhorse, dashed forward at full gallop followed by the rest of the men.\r\n\r\nThe trappers encamped that night on the edge of a wide grassy plain,\r\nwhich offered such tempting food for the horses that Pierre resolved to\r\nforego his usual cautious plan of picketting them close to the camp, and\r\nset them loose on the plain, merely hobbling them to prevent their\r\nstraying far.\r\n\r\nDick remonstrated, but in vain.  An insolent answer was all he got for\r\nhis pains.  He determined, however, to keep Charlie close beside him all\r\nnight, and also made up his mind to keep a sharp look out on the other\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nAt supper he again remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"No fraid,\" said Pierre, whose pipe was beginning to improve his temper.\r\n\"The red reptiles no dare to come in open plain when de moon so clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dun know that,\" said a taciturn trapper, who seldom ventured a remark\r\nof any kind; \"them varmints 'ud steal the two eyes out o' you' head when\r\nthey set their hearts on't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat ar' umposs'ble, for de have no hearts,\" said a half-breed; \"dey\r\nhave von hole vere de heart vas be.\"\r\n\r\nThis was received with a shout of laughter, in the midst of which an\r\nappalling yell was heard, and, as if by magic, four Indians were seen on\r\nthe backs of four of the best horses, yelling like fiends, and driving\r\nall the other horses furiously before them over the plain.\r\n\r\nHow they got there was a complete mystery, but the men did not wait to\r\nconsider that point.  Catching up their guns they sprang after them with\r\nthe fury of madmen, and were quickly scattered far and wide.  Dick\r\nordered Crusoe to follow and help the men, and turned to spring on the\r\nback of Charlie, but at that moment he observed an Indian's head and\r\nshoulders rise above the grass, not fifty yards in advance from him, so\r\nwithout hesitation he darted forward, intending to pounce upon him.\r\n\r\nWell would it have been for Dick Varley had he at that time possessed a\r\nlittle more experience of the wiles and stratagems of the Banattees.\r\nThe Snake nation is subdivided into several tribes, of which those\r\ninhabiting the Rocky Mountains, called the Banattees, are the most\r\nperfidious.  Indeed, they are confessedly the banditti of the hills, and\r\nrespect neither friend nor foe, but rob all who come in their way.\r\n\r\nDick reached the spot where the Indian had disappeared in less than a\r\nminute, but no savage was to be seen!  Thinking he had crept ahead he\r\nran on a few yards further, and darted about hither and thither, while\r\nhis eye glanced from side to side.  Suddenly a shout in the camp\r\nattracted his attention, and looking back he beheld the savage on\r\nCharlie's back turning to fly.  Next moment he was off and away far\r\nbeyond the hope of recovery.  Dick had left his rifle in the camp,\r\notherwise the savage would have gone but a short way--as it was, Dick\r\nreturned, and sitting down on a mound of grass, stared straight before\r\nhim with a feeling akin to despair.  Even Crusoe could not have helped\r\nhim had he been there, for nothing on four legs, or on two, could keep\r\npace with Charlie.\r\n\r\nThe Banattee achieved this feat by adopting a stratagem which invariably\r\ndeceives those who are ignorant of their habits and tactics.  When\r\nsuddenly pursued the Banattee sinks into the grass, and, serpentlike,\r\ncreeps along with wonderful rapidity, not _from_ but _towards_ his\r\nenemy, taking care, however, to avoid him, so that when the pursuer\r\nreaches the spot where the pursued is supposed to be hiding, he hears\r\nhim shout a yell of defiance far away in the rear.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the Banattee eluded Dick and gained the camp almost as\r\nsoon as the other reached the spot where he had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOne by one the trappers came back weary, raging, and despairing.  In a\r\nshort time they all assembled, and soon began to reproach each other.\r\nEre long one or two had a fight, which resulted in several bloody noses\r\nand black eyes, thus adding to the misery which, one would think, had\r\nbeen bad enough without such additions.  At last they finished their\r\nsuppers and their pipes, and then lay down to sleep under the trees till\r\nmorning, when they arose in a particularly silent and sulky mood, rolled\r\nup their blankets, strapped their things on their shoulders, and began\r\nto trudge slowly back to the camp on foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nWOLVES ATTACK THE HORSES, AND CAMERON CIRCUMVENTS THE WOLVES--A\r\nBEAR-HUNT, IN WHICH HENRI SHINES CONSPICUOUS--JOE AND THE\r\n\"NATTER-LIST\"--AN ALARM--A SURPRISE AND A CAPTURE.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the camp where Walter Cameron still guarded the\r\ngoods, and the men pursued their trapping avocations.\r\n\r\nHere seven of the horses had been killed in one night by wolves while\r\ngrazing in a plain close to the camp, and on the night following a horse\r\nthat had strayed was also torn to pieces and devoured.  The prompt and\r\ndaring manner in which this had been done convinced the trader that\r\nwhite wolves had unfortunately scented them out, and he set several\r\ntraps in the hope of capturing them.\r\n\r\nWhite wolves are quite distinct from the ordinary wolves that prowl\r\nthrough woods and plains in large packs.  They are much larger, weighing\r\nsometimes as much as a hundred and thirty pounds; but they are\r\ncomparatively scarce, and move about alone, or in small bands of three\r\nor four.  Their strength is enormous, and they are so fierce that they\r\ndo not hesitate, upon occasions, to attack man himself.  Their method of\r\nkilling horses is very deliberate.  Two wolves generally undertake the\r\ncold-blooded murder.  They approach their victim with the most innocent\r\nlooking and frolicsome gambols, lying down and rolling about, and\r\nfrisking pleasantly until the horse becomes a little accustomed to them.\r\nThen one approaches right in front, the other in rear, still frisking\r\nplayfully, until they think themselves near enough, when they make a\r\nsimultaneous rush.  The wolf which approaches in rear is the true\r\nassailant; the rush of the other is a mere feint; then both fasten on\r\nthe poor horse's haunches and never let go till the sinews are cut and\r\nhe is rolling on his side.\r\n\r\nThe horse makes comparatively little struggle in this deadly assault.\r\nHe seems paralysed and soon falls to rise no more.\r\n\r\nCameron set his traps towards evening in a circle with a bait in the\r\ncentre and then retired to rest.  Next morning he called Joe Blunt and\r\nthe two went off together.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange that these rascally white wolves should be so bold when\r\nthe smaller kinds are so cowardly,\" remarked Cameron, as they walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\"So 'tis,\" replied Joe, \"but I've seed them other chaps bold enough too\r\nin the prairie when they were in large packs and starvin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe the small wolves follow the big fellows and help them to eat\r\nwhat they kill, though they generally sit round and look on at the\r\nkilling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" exclaimed Joe, cocking his gun, \"there he is, an' no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThere he was, undoubtedly.  A wolf of the largest size with one of his\r\nfeet in the trap.  He was a terrible-looking object, for, besides his\r\nimmense size and naturally ferocious aspect, his white hair bristled on\r\nend and was all covered with streaks and spots of blood from his bloody\r\njaws.  In his efforts to escape he had bitten the trap until he had\r\nbroken his teeth and lacerated his gums, so that his appearance was\r\nhideous in the extreme.  And when the two men came up he struggled with\r\nall his might to fly at them.\r\n\r\nCameron and Joe stood looking at him in a sort of wondering admiration.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better put a ball in him,\" suggested Joe after a time.  \"Mayhap\r\nthe chain won't stand sich tugs long.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Joe; if it breaks we might get an ugly nip before we killed him.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying Cameron fired into the wolf's head and killed it.  It was\r\nfound, on examination, that four wolves had been in the traps, but the\r\nrest had escaped.  Two of them, however, had gnawed off their paws and\r\nleft them lying in the traps.\r\n\r\nAfter this the big wolves did not trouble them again.  The same\r\nafternoon, a bear-hunt was undertaken, which well-nigh cost one of the\r\nIroquois his life.  It happened thus:--\r\n\r\nWhile Cameron and Joe were away after the white wolves, Henri came\r\nfloundering into camp tossing his arms like a maniac, and shouting that\r\n\"seven bars wos be down in de bush close bye!\"  It chanced that this was\r\nan idle day with most of the men, so they all leaped on their horses,\r\nand taking guns and knives sallied forth to give battle to the bears.\r\n\r\nArrived at the scene of action they found the seven bears busily engaged\r\nin digging up roots, so the men separated in order to surround them, and\r\nthen closed in.  The place was partly open and partly covered with thick\r\nbushes into which a horseman could not penetrate.  The moment the bears\r\ngot wind of what was going forward they made off as fast as possible,\r\nand then commenced a scene of firing, galloping, and yelling, that\r\ndefies description!  Four out of the seven were shot before they gained\r\nthe bushes; the other three were wounded, but made good their retreat.\r\nAs their places of shelter, however, were like islands in the plain,\r\nthey had no chance of escaping.\r\n\r\nThe horsemen now dismounted and dashed recklessly into the bushes, where\r\nthey soon discovered and killed two of the bears; the third was not\r\nfound for some time.  At last an Iroquois came upon it so suddenly that\r\nhe had not time to point his gun before the bear sprang upon him and\r\nstruck him to the earth, where it held him down.\r\n\r\nInstantly the place was surrounded by eager men, but the bushes were so\r\nthick and the fallen trees among which the bear stood were so numerous,\r\nthat they could not use their guns without running the risk of shooting\r\ntheir companion.  Most of them drew their knives and seemed about to\r\nrush on the bear with these, but the monster's aspect, as it glared\r\nround, was so terrible that they held back for a moment in hesitation.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Henri, who had been at some distance engaged in the\r\nkilling of one of the other bears, came rushing forward after his own\r\npeculiar manner.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! fat is eet--hay? de bar no go under yit?\"\r\n\r\nJust then his eye fell on the wounded Iroquois with the bear above him,\r\nand he uttered a yell so intense in tone that the bear himself seemed to\r\nfeel that something decisive was about to be done at last.  Henri did\r\nnot pause, but with a flying dash he sprang like a spread eagle, arms\r\nand legs extended, right into the bear's bosom.  At the same moment he\r\nsent his long hunting-knife down into its heart.  But Bruin is\r\nproverbially hard to kill, and although mortally wounded, he had\r\nstrength enough to open his jaws and close them on Henri's neck.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of horror, and at the same moment a volley was fired at\r\nthe bear's head, for the trappers felt that it was better to risk\r\nshooting their comrades than see them killed before their eyes.\r\nFortunately the bullets took effect, and tumbled him over at once\r\nwithout doing damage to either of the men, although several of the balls\r\njust grazed Henri's temple and carried off his cap.\r\n\r\nAlthough uninjured by the shot, the poor Iroquois had not escaped\r\nscatheless from the paw of the bear.  His scalp was torn almost off, and\r\nhung down over his eyes, while blood streamed down his face.  He was\r\nconveyed by his comrades to the camp, where he lay two days in a state\r\nof insensibility, at the end of which time he revived and recovered\r\ndaily.  Afterwards when the camp moved he had to be carried, but in the\r\ncourse of two months he was as well as ever, and quite as fond of\r\nbear-hunting!\r\n\r\nAmong other trophies of this hunt there were two deer, and a buffalo,\r\nwhich last had probably strayed from the herd.  Four or five Iroquois\r\nwere round this animal whetting their knives for the purpose of cutting\r\nit up when Henri passed, so he turned aside to watch them perform the\r\noperation, quite regardless of the fact that his neck and face were\r\ncovered with blood which flowed from one or two small punctures made by\r\nthe bear.\r\n\r\nThe Indians began by taking off the skin, which certainly did not occupy\r\nthem more than five minutes.  Then they cut up the meat and made a pack\r\nof it, and cut out the tongue, which is somewhat troublesome, as that\r\nmember requires to be cut out from under the jaw of the animal, and not\r\nthrough the natural opening of the mouth.  One of the fore-legs was cut\r\noff at the knee joint, and this was used as a hammer with which to break\r\nthe skull for the purpose of taking out the brains, these being used in\r\nthe process of dressing and softening the animal's skin.  An axe would\r\nhave been of advantage to break the skull, but in the hurry of rushing\r\nto the attack the Indians had forgotten their axes, so they adopted the\r\ncommon fashion of using the buffalo's hoof as a hammer, the shank being\r\nthe handle.  The whole operation of flaying, cutting up, and packing the\r\nmeat, did not occupy more than twenty minutes.  Before leaving the\r\nground these expert butchers treated themselves to a little of the\r\nmarrow and warm liver in a raw state!\r\n\r\nCameron and Joe walked up to the group while they were indulging in this\r\nlittle feast.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've often seen that eaten, but I never could do it myself,\"\r\nremarked the former.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried Joe in surprise; \"now that's oncommon cur'us.  I've _lived_\r\non raw liver an' marrow-bones for two or three days at a time, when we\r\nwos chased by the Camanchee Injuns and didn't dare to make a fire, an'\r\nit's ra'al good it is.  Won't ye try it _now_?\"\r\n\r\nCameron shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, thankee; I'll not refuse when I can't help it, but until then I'll\r\nremain in happy ignorance of how good it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it _is_ strange how some folk can't abide anything in the meat\r\nway they han't bin used to.  D'ye know I've actually knowd men from the\r\ncities as wouldn't eat a bit o' horseflesh for love or money.  Would ye\r\nbelieve it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe that, Joe, for I have met with such persons myself;\r\nin fact, they are rather numerous.  What are you chuckling at, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chucklin'? if ye mean be that `larfin' in to myself' it's because I'm\r\nthinkin' o' a chap as once comed out to the prairies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us walk back to the camp, Joe, and you can tell me about him as we\r\ngo along.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" continued Joe, \"he comed from Washington, but I never could\r\nmake out right whether he wos a government man or not.  Anyhow, he wos a\r\npheelosopher--a natter-list I think he call his-self.\"\r\n\r\n\"A naturalist,\" suggested Cameron.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that wos more like it.  Well, he wos about six feet two in his\r\nmoccasins, an' as thin as a ramrod, an' as blind as a bat--leastways he\r\nhad weak eyes an wore green spectacles.  He had on a grey shootin' coat\r\nand trousers and vest and cap, with rid whiskers an' a long nose as rid\r\nat the point as the whiskers wos.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this gentleman engaged me an' another hunter to go a trip with\r\nhim into the prairies, so off we sot one fine day on three hosses with\r\nour blankets at our backs--we wos to depend on the rifle for victuals.\r\nAt first I thought the Natter-list one o' the cruellest beggars as iver\r\nwent on two long legs, for he used to go about everywhere pokin' pins\r\nthrough all the beetles, and flies, an' creepin' things he could sot\r\neyes on, an' stuck them in a box; but he told me he comed here a-purpose\r\nto git as many o' them as he could; so says I, `If that's it, I'll fill\r\nyer box in no time.'\r\n\r\n\"`Will ye?' says he, quite pleased like.\r\n\r\n\"`I will,' says I, an' galloped off to a place as was filled wi' all\r\nsorts o' crawlin' things.  So I sets to work, and whenever I seed a\r\nthing crawlin' I sot my fut on it and crushed it, and soon filled my\r\nbreast pocket.  I coched a lot o' butterflies too, an' stuffed them into\r\nmy shot pouch, and went back in an hour or two an' showed him the lot.\r\nHe put on his green spectacles and looked at them as if he'd seen a\r\nrattlesnake.\r\n\r\n\"`My good man,' says he, `you've crushed them all to pieces!'\r\n\r\n\"`They'll taste as good for all that,' says I, for somehow I'd taken't\r\nin me head that he'd heard o' the way the Injuns make soup o' the\r\ngrasshoppers, an was wantin' to try his hand at a new dish!\r\n\r\n\"He laughed when I said this, an' told me he wos collectin' them to take\r\nhome to be _looked_ at.  But that's not wot I wos goin' to tell ye about\r\nhim,\" continued Joe; \"I wos goin' to tell ye how we made him eat\r\nhorseflesh.  He carried a revolver, too, this Natter-list did, to load\r\nwi' shot as small as dust a-most, and shoot little birds with.  I've\r\nseed him miss birds only three feet away with it.  An' one day he drew\r\nit all of a suddent and let fly at a big bum-bee that wos passin',\r\nyellin' out that it wos the finest wot he had iver seed.  He missed the\r\nbee, of coorse, cause it was a flyin' shot, he said, but he sent the\r\nwhole charge right into Martin's back--Martin was my comrade's name.  By\r\ngood luck Martin had on a thick leather coat, so the shot niver got the\r\nlength o' his skin.\r\n\r\n\"One day I noticed that the Natter-list had stuffed small corks into the\r\nmuzzles of all the six barrels of his revolver.  I wondered what they\r\nwos for, but he wos al'ays doin' sich queer _things_ that I soon forgot\r\nit.  `May be,' thought I, jist before it went out o' my mind,--`may be\r\nhe thinks that 'll stop the pistol from goin' off by accident,' for ye\r\nmust know he'd let it off three times the first day by accident, and\r\nwell-nigh blowed off his leg the last time, only the shot lodged in the\r\nback o' a big toad he'd jist stuffed into his breeches' pocket.  Well,\r\nsoon after, we shot a buffalo bull, so when it fell, off he jumps from\r\nhis horse an runs up to it.  So did I, for I wasn't sure the beast was\r\ndead, an' I had jist got up when it rose an' rushed at the Natter-list.\r\n\r\n\"`Out o' the way,' I yelled, for my rifle was empty; but he didn't move,\r\nso I rushed forward an' drew the pistol out o' his belt and let fly in\r\nthe bull's ribs jist as it ran the poor man down.  Martin came up that\r\nmoment an' put a ball through its heart, and then we went to pick up the\r\nNatter-list.  He came to in a little, an' the first thing he said was,\r\n`Where's my revolver?'  When I gave it to him he looked at it, an' said\r\nwith a solemcholy shake o' the head, `There's a whole barrel-full lost!'\r\nIt turned out that he had taken to usin' the barrels for bottles to\r\nhold things in, but he forgot to draw the charges, so sure enough I had\r\nfired a charge o' bum-bees, an' beetles, an' small shot into the\r\nbuffalo!\r\n\r\n\"But that's not what I wos goin' to tell ye yet.  We comed to a part o'\r\nthe plains where we wos well-nigh starved for want o' game, an' the\r\nNatter-list got so thin that ye could a-most see through him, so I\r\noffered to kill my horse, an' cut it up for meat; but you niver saw sich\r\na face he made.  `I'd rather die first,' says he, `than eat it;' so we\r\ndidn't kill it.  But that very day Martin got a shot at a wild horse and\r\nkilled it.  The Natter-list was down in the bed o' a creek at the time\r\ngropin' for creepers, an' he didn't see it.\r\n\r\n\"`He'll niver eat it,' says Martin.\r\n\r\n\"`That's true,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"`Let's tell him it's a buffalo,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"`That would be tellin' a lie,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"So we stood lookin' at each other, not knowin' what to do.\r\n\r\n\"`I'll tell ye what,' cries Martin, `we'll cut it up, and take the meat\r\ninto camp and cook it without _sayin' a word_.'\r\n\r\n\"`Done,' says I, `that's it;' for ye must know the poor creature wos no\r\njudge o' meat.  He couldn't tell one kind from another, an' he niver\r\naxed questions.  In fact he niver a-most spoke to us all the trip.\r\nWell, we cut up the horse and carried the flesh and marrow-bones into\r\ncamp, takin' care to leave the hoofs and skin behind, and sot to work\r\nand roasted steaks and marrow-bones.\r\n\r\n\"When the Natter-list came back ye should ha' seen the joyful face he\r\nput on when he smelt the grub, for he was all but starved out, poor\r\ncritter.\r\n\r\n\"`What have we got here?' cried he, rubbin' his hands and sittin' down.\r\n\r\n\"`Steaks an' marrow-bones,' says Martin.\r\n\r\n\"`Capital!' says he.  `I'm _so_ hungry.'\r\n\r\n\"So he fell to work like a wolf.  I niver seed a man pitch into anything\r\nlike as that Natter-list did into that horseflesh.\r\n\r\n\"`These are first-rate marrow-bones,' says he, squintin' with one eye\r\ndown the shin bone o' the hind-leg to see if it was quite empty.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, sir, they is,' answered Martin, as grave as a judge.\r\n\r\n\"`Take another, sir,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"`No, thankee,' says he with a sigh, for he didn't like to leave off.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we lived for a week on horseflesh, an' first-rate livin' it wos;\r\nthen we fell in with buffalo, an' niver ran short again till we got to\r\nthe settlements, when he paid us our money an' shook hands, sayin' we'd\r\nhad a nice trip an' he wished us well.  Jist as we wos partin' I said,\r\nsays I, `D'ye know what it wos we lived on for a week arter we wos\r\nwell-nigh starved in the prairies?'\r\n\r\n\"`What,' says he, `when we got yon capital marrow-bones?'\r\n\r\n\"`The same,' says I; `yon was _horseflesh_,' says I, `an' I think ye'll\r\nsur'ly niver say again that it isn't first-rate livin'.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yer jokin',' says he, turnin' pale.\r\n\r\n\"`It's true, sir, as true as yer standin' there.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, would ye believe it; he turned--that Natter-list did--as sick as\r\na dog on the spot wot he wos standin' on, an' didn't taste meat again\r\nfor three days!\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of Joe's story they reached the camp, and\r\nhere they found the women and children flying about in a state of\r\nterror, and the few men who had been left in charge arming themselves in\r\nthe greatest haste.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! something wrong here,\" cried Cameron hastening forward followed\r\nby Joe.  \"What has happened, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Injuns comin', monsieur, look dere,\" answered a trapper, pointing down\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\n\"Arm and mount at once, and come to the front of the camp,\" cried\r\nCameron in a tone of voice that silenced every other, and turned\r\nconfusion into order.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all this outcry was a cloud of dust seen far down the\r\nvalley, which was raised by a band of mounted Indians who approached the\r\ncamp at full speed.  Their numbers could not be made out, but they were\r\na sufficiently formidable band to cause much anxiety to Cameron, whose\r\nmen, at the time, were scattered to the various trapping grounds, and\r\nonly ten chanced to be within call of the camp.  However, with these ten\r\nhe determined to show a bold front to the savages, whether they came as\r\nfriends or foes.  He therefore ordered the women and children within the\r\ncitadel formed of the goods and packs of furs piled upon each other,\r\nwhich point of retreat was to be defended to the last extremity.  Then\r\ngalloping to the front he collected his men and swept down the valley at\r\nfull speed.  In a few minutes they were near enough to observe that the\r\nenemy only numbered four Indians, who were driving a band of about a\r\nhundred horses before them, and so busy were they in keeping the troop\r\ntogether that Cameron and his men were close upon them before they were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to escape.  Joe Blunt and Henri had already swept round\r\nand cut off their retreat.  In this extremity the Indians slipped from\r\nthe backs of their steeds and darted into the bushes, where they were\r\nsafe from pursuit, at least on horseback, while the trappers got behind\r\nthe horses and drove them towards the camp.\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of the horses sprang ahead of the others and made for\r\nthe mountain, with its mane and tail flying wildly in the breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Marrow-bones and buttons!\" shouted one of the men, \"there goes Dick\r\nVarley's horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it am!\" cried Henri, and dashed off in pursuit, followed by Joe and\r\ntwo others.\r\n\r\n\"Why, these are our own horses,\" said Cameron in surprise, as they drove\r\nthem into a corner of the hills from which they could not escape.\r\n\r\nThis was true, but it was only half the truth, for, besides their own\r\nhorses, they had secured upwards of seventy Indian steeds, a most\r\nacceptable addition to their stud, which, owing to casualties and\r\nwolves, had been diminishing too much of late.  The fact was, that the\r\nIndians who had captured the horses belonging to Pierre and his party\r\nwere a small band of robbers who had travelled, as was afterwards\r\nlearned, a considerable distance from the south, stealing horses from\r\nvarious tribes as they went along.  As we have seen, in an evil hour\r\nthey fell in with Pierre's party and carried off their steeds, which\r\nthey drove to a pass leading from one valley to the other.  Here they\r\nunited them with the main band of their ill-gotten gains, and while the\r\ngreater number of the robbers descended further into the plains in\r\nsearch of more booty, four of them were sent into the mountains with the\r\nhorses already procured.  These four, utterly ignorant of the presence\r\nof white men in the valley, drove their charge, as we have seen, almost\r\ninto the camp.\r\n\r\nCameron immediately organised a party to go out in search of Pierre and\r\nhis companions, about whose fate he became intensely anxious, and in the\r\ncourse of half an hour as many men as he could spare with safety were\r\ndespatched in the direction of the Blue Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCHARLIE'S ADVENTURES WITH SAVAGES AND BEARS--TRAPPING LIFE.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to chase a horse; it is another thing to catch it.\r\nLittle consideration and less sagacity is required to convince us of the\r\ntruth of that fact.\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps venture to think this rather a trifling fact.  We\r\nare not so sure of that.  In this world of fancies, to have _any_ fact\r\nincontestably proved and established is a comfort, and whatever is a\r\nsource of comfort to mankind is worthy of notice.  Surely our reader\r\nwon't deny that!  Perhaps he will, so we can only console ourself with\r\nthe remark that there are people in this world who would deny\r\n_anything_--who would deny that there was a nose on their face if you\r\nsaid there was!\r\n\r\nWell, to return to the point, which was the chase of a horse in the\r\nabstract; from which we will rapidly diverge to the chase of Dick\r\nVarley's horse in particular.  This noble charger, having been ridden by\r\nsavages until all his old fire, and blood, and metal were worked up to a\r\nred heat, no sooner discovered that he was pursued than he gave a snort\r\nof defiance, which he accompanied with a frantic shake of his mane, and\r\na fling of contempt in addition to a magnificent wave of his tail; then\r\nhe thundered up the valley at a pace which would speedily have left Joe\r\nBlunt and Henri out of sight behind if--ay! that's the word, _if_! what\r\na word that _if_ is! what a world of if's we live in!  There never was\r\nanything that wouldn't have been something else _if_ something hadn't\r\nintervened to prevent it!  Yes, we repeat, Charlie would have left his\r\ntwo friends miles and miles behind in what is called \"no time,\" _if_ he\r\nhad not run straight into a gorge which was surrounded by inaccessible\r\nprecipices, and out of which there was no exit except by the entrance,\r\nwhich was immediately barred by Henri, while Joe advanced to catch the\r\nrunaway.\r\n\r\nFor two hours at least did Joe Blunt essay to catch Charlie, and during\r\nthat space of time he utterly failed.  The horse seemed to have made up\r\nhis mind for what is vulgarly termed \"a lark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't do, Henri,\" said Joe, advancing towards his companion, and\r\nwiping his forehead with the cuff of his leathern coat.  \"I can't catch\r\nhim.  The wind's a-most blowed out o' me body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat am vexatiable,\" replied Henri, in a tone of commiseration.  \"S'pose\r\nI wos make try?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I s'pose ye would fail.  But go ahead an' do what ye can.\r\nI'll hold yer horse.\"\r\n\r\nSo Henri began by a rush and a flourish of legs and arms that nearly\r\nfrightened the horse out his wits.  For half an hour he went through all\r\nthe complications of running and twisting of which he was capable,\r\nwithout success, when Joe Blunt suddenly uttered a stentorian yell that\r\nrooted him to the spot on which he stood.\r\n\r\nTo account for this, we must explain that in the heights of the Rocky\r\nMountains vast accumulations of snow take place among the crevices and\r\ngorges during winter.  Such of these masses as form on steep slopes are\r\nloosened by occasional thaws, and are precipitated in the form of\r\navalanches into the valleys below, carrying trees and stones along with\r\nthem in their thundering descent.  In the gloomy gorge where Dick's\r\nhorse had taken refuge, the precipices were so steep that many\r\navalanches had occurred, as was evident from the mounds of heaped snow\r\nthat lay at the foot of most of them.  Neither stones nor trees were\r\ncarried down here, however, for the cliffs were nearly perpendicular,\r\nand the snow slipping over their edges had fallen on the grass below.\r\nSuch an avalanche was now about to take place, and it was this that\r\ncaused Joe to utter his cry of alarm and warning.\r\n\r\nHenri and the horse were directly under the cliff over which it was\r\nabout to be hurled, the latter close to the wall of rock, the other at\r\nsome distance away from it.\r\n\r\nJoe cried again, \"Back, Henri! back _vite_!\" when the mass _flowed over_\r\nand fell with a roar like prolonged thunder.  Henri sprang back in time\r\nto save his life, though he was knocked down and almost stunned, but\r\npoor Charlie was completely buried under the avalanche, which now\r\npresented the appearance of a _hill_ of snow.\r\n\r\nThe instant Henri recovered sufficiently, Joe and he mounted their\r\nhorses and galloped back to the camp as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, another spectator stepped forward upon the scene they had\r\nleft, and surveyed the snow hill with a critical eye.  This was no less\r\nthan a grizzly bear which had, unobserved, been a spectator, and which\r\nimmediately proceeded to dig into the mound with the purpose, no doubt,\r\nof disentombing the carcase of the horse for purposes of his own.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus actively engaged, the two hunters reached the camp\r\nwhere they found that Pierre and his party had just arrived.  The men\r\nsent out in search of them had scarcely advanced a mile when they found\r\nthem trudging back to the camp in a very disconsolate manner.  But all\r\ntheir sorrows were put to flight on hearing of the curious way in which\r\nthe horses had been returned to them with interest.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Dick Varley, however, congratulated himself on the recovery\r\nof his gallant steed, when he was thrown into despair by the sudden\r\narrival of Joe with the tidings of the catastrophe we have just related.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a general rush to the rescue.  Only a few men were\r\nordered to remain to guard the camp, while the remainder mounted their\r\nhorses and galloped towards the gorge where Charlie had been entombed.\r\nOn arriving, they found that Bruin had worked with such laudable zeal\r\nthat nothing but the tip of his tail was seen sticking out of the hole\r\nwhich he had dug.  The hunters could not refrain from laughing as they\r\nsprang to the ground, and standing in a semicircle in front of the hole,\r\nprepared to fire.  But Crusoe resolved to have the honour of leading the\r\nassault.  He seized fast hold of Bruin's flank, and caused his teeth to\r\nmeet therein.  Caleb backed out at once and turned round, but before he\r\ncould recover from his surprise a dozen bullets pierced his heart and\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" cried Cameron, setting to work with a large wooden shovel,\r\n\"work like niggers.  If there's any life left in the horse it'll soon be\r\nsmothered out unless we set him free.\"\r\n\r\nThe men needed no urging, however.  They worked as if their lives\r\ndepended on their exertions.  Dick Varley, in particular, laboured like\r\na young Hercules, and Henri hurled masses of snow about in a most\r\nsurprising manner.  Crusoe, too, entered heartily into the spirit of the\r\nwork, and, scraping with his forepaws, sent such a continuous shower of\r\nsnow behind him that he was speedily lost to view in a hole of his own\r\nexcavating.  In the course of half an hour a cavern was dug in the mound\r\nalmost close up to the cliff, and the men were beginning to look about\r\nfor the crushed body of Dick's steed, when an exclamation from Henri\r\nattracted their attention.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! mes ami, here am be one hole.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this could not be doubted, for the eccentric trapper had\r\nthrust his shovel through the wall of snow into what appeared to be a\r\ncavern beyond, and immediately followed up his remark by thrusting in\r\nhis head and shoulders.  He drew them out in a few seconds, with a look\r\nof intense amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Voila!  Joe Blunt.  Look in dere, and you shall see fat you will\r\nbehold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's the horse, I do b'lieve!\" cried Joe.  \"Go ahead, lads.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he resumed his shovelling vigorously, and in a few minutes\r\nthe hole was opened up sufficiently to enable a man to enter.  Dick\r\nsprang in, and there stood Charlie close beside the cliff, looking as\r\nsedate and unconcerned as if all that had been going on had no reference\r\nto him whatever.\r\n\r\nThe cause of his safety was simple enough.  The precipice beside which\r\nhe stood when the avalanche occurred overhung its base at that point\r\nconsiderably, so that when the snow descended, a clear space of several\r\nfeet wide was left all along its base.  Here Charlie had remained in\r\nperfect comfort until his friends dug him out.\r\n\r\nCongratulating themselves not a little on having saved the charger and\r\nbagged a grizzly bear, the trappers remounted, and returned to the camp.\r\n\r\nFor some time after this nothing worthy of particular note occurred.\r\nThe trapping operations went on prosperously and without interruption\r\nfrom the Indians, who seemed to have left the locality altogether.\r\nDuring this period, Dick, and Crusoe, and Charlie had many excursions\r\ntogether, and the silver rifle full many a time sent death to the heart\r\nof bear, and elk, and buffalo, while, indirectly, it sent joy to the\r\nheart of man, woman, and child in camp, in the shape of juicy steaks and\r\nmarrow-bones.  Joe and Henri devoted themselves almost exclusively to\r\ntrapping beaver, in which pursuit they were so successful that they\r\nspeedily became wealthy men, according to backwood notions of wealth.\r\nWith the beaver that they caught, they purchased from Cameron's store\r\npowder and shot enough for a long hunting expedition and a couple of\r\nspare horses to carry their packs.  They also purchased a large\r\nassortment of such goods and trinkets as would prove acceptable to\r\nIndians, and supplied themselves with new blankets, and a few pairs of\r\nstrong moccasins, of which they stood much in need.\r\n\r\nThus they went on from day to day, until symptoms of the approach of\r\nwinter warned them that it was time to return to the Mustang Valley.\r\nAbout this time an event occurred which totally changed the aspect of\r\naffairs in these remote valleys of the Rocky Mountains, and precipitated\r\nthe departure of our four friends, Dick, Joe, Henri, and Crusoe.  This\r\nwas the sudden arrival of a whole tribe of Indians.  As their advent was\r\nsomewhat remarkable, we shall devote to it the commencement of a new\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nSAVAGE SPORTS--LIVING CATARACTS--AN ALARM--INDIANS AND THEIR DOINGS--THE\r\nSTAMPEDO--CHARLIE AGAIN.\r\n\r\nOne day Dick Varley was out on a solitary hunting expedition near the\r\nrocky gorge, where his horse had received temporary burial a week or two\r\nbefore.  Crusoe was with him, of course.  Dick had tied Charlie to a\r\ntree, and was sunning himself on the edge of a cliff, from the top of\r\nwhich he had a fine view of the valley and the rugged precipices that\r\nhemmed it in.\r\n\r\nJust in front of the spot on which he sat, the precipices on the\r\nopposite side of the gorge rose to a considerable height above him, so\r\nthat their ragged outlines were drawn sharply across the clear sky.\r\nDick was gazing in dreamy silence at the jutting rocks and dark caverns,\r\nand speculating on the probable number of bears that dwelt there, when a\r\nslight degree of restlessness on the part of Crusoe attracted him.\r\n\r\n\"What is't, pup?\" said he, laying his hand on the dog's broad back.\r\n\r\nCrusoe looked the answer, \"I don't know, Dick, but it's _something_, you\r\nmay depend upon it, else I would not have disturbed you.\"\r\n\r\nDick lifted his rifle from the ground, and laid it in the hollow of his\r\nleft arm.\r\n\r\n\"There must be something in the wind,\" remarked Dick.\r\n\r\nAs wind is known to be composed of two distinct gases, Crusoe felt\r\nperfectly safe in replying \"Yes,\" with his tail.  Immediately after he\r\nadded, \"Hallo! did you hear that?\"--with his ears.\r\n\r\nDick did hear it, and sprang hastily to his feet, as a sound like, yet\r\nunlike, distant thunder came faintly down upon the breeze.  In a few\r\nseconds the sound increased to a roar in which was mingled the wild\r\ncries of men.  Neither Dick nor Crusoe moved, for the sounds came from\r\nbehind the heights in front of them, and they felt that the only way to\r\nsolve the question, \"What can the sounds be?\" was to wait till the\r\nsounds should solve it themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the muffled sounds gave place to the distinct bellowing of\r\ncattle, the clatter of innumerable hoofs, and the yells of savage men,\r\nwhile at the same moment the edges of the opposite cliffs became alive\r\nwith Indians and buffaloes rushing about in frantic haste--the former\r\nalmost mad with savage excitement, the latter with blind rage and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the edge of the dizzy precipice, the buffaloes turned\r\nabruptly and tossed their ponderous heads as they coursed along the\r\nedge.  Yet a few of them, unable to check their headlong course, fell\r\nover, and were dashed to pieces on the rocks below.  Such falls, Dick\r\nobserved, were hailed with shouts of delight by the Indians, whose sole\r\nobject evidently was to enjoy the sport of driving the terrified animals\r\nover the precipice.  The wily savages had chosen their ground well for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nThe cliff immediately opposite to Dick Varley was a huge projection from\r\nthe precipice that hemmed in the gorge, or species of cape or promontory\r\nseveral hundred yards wide at the base, and narrowing abruptly to a\r\npoint.  The sides of this wedge-shaped projection were quite\r\nperpendicular; indeed, in some places the top overhung the base, and\r\nthey were at least three hundred feet high.  Broken and jagged rocks, of\r\nthat peculiarly chaotic character which probably suggested the name to\r\nthis part of the great American chain, projected from, and were\r\nscattered all round, the cliffs.  Over these the Indians, whose numbers\r\nincreased every moment, strove to drive the luckless herd of buffaloes\r\nthat had chanced to fall in their way.  The task was easy.  The\r\nunsuspecting animals, of which there were hundreds, rushed in a dense\r\nmass upon the cape referred to.  On they came with irresistible\r\nimpetuosity, bellowing furiously, while their hoofs thundered on the\r\nturf with the muffled continuous roar of a distant, but mighty\r\ncataract--the Indians, meanwhile, urging them on by hideous yell and\r\nfrantic gesture.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard came bounding madly to the edge of the precipice.\r\nHere they stopped short, and gazed affrighted at the gulf below.  It was\r\nbut for a moment.  The irresistible momentum of the flying mass behind\r\npushed them over.  Down they came, absolutely a living cataract, upon\r\nthe rocks below.  Some struck on the projecting rocks in the descent,\r\nand their bodies were dashed almost in pieces, while their blood spurted\r\nout in showers.  Others leaped from rock to rock with awful bounds,\r\nuntil, losing their foot-hold, they fell headlong, while others\r\ndescended sheer down into the sweltering mass that lay shattered at the\r\nbase of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nDick Varley and his dog remained rooted to the rock, as they gazed at\r\nthe sickening sight, as if petrified.  Scarce fifty of that noble herd\r\nof buffaloes escaped the awful leap, but they escaped only to fall\r\nbefore the arrows of their ruthless pursuers.  Dick had often heard of\r\nthis tendency of the Indians, where buffaloes were very numerous, to\r\ndrive them over precipices in mere wanton sport and cruelty, but he had\r\nnever seen it until now, and the sight filled his soul with horror.  It\r\nwas not until the din and tumult of the perishing herd and the shrill\r\nyells of the Indians had almost died away that he turned to quit the\r\nspot.  But the instant he did so another shout was raised.  The savages\r\nhad observed him, and were seen galloping along the cliffs towards the\r\nhead of the gorge, with the obvious intention of gaining the other side\r\nand capturing him.  Dick sprang on Charlie's back, and the next instant\r\nwas flying down the valley towards the camp.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, fear being overtaken, for the gorge could not be\r\ncrossed, and the way round the head of it was long and rugged; but he\r\nwas anxious to alarm the camp as quickly as possible, so that they might\r\nhave time to call in the more distant trappers and make preparations for\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\"Where away now, youngster,\" inquired Cameron, emerging from his tent as\r\nDick, taking the brook that flowed in front at a flying leap, came\r\ncrashing through the bushes into the midst of the fur-packs at full\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n\"Injuns!\" ejaculated Dick, reining up, and vaulting out of the saddle.\r\n\"Hundreds of 'em.  Fiends incarnate every one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they near?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; an hour 'll bring them down on us.  Are Joe and Henri far from\r\ncamp to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Ten-mile Creek,\" replied Cameron with an expression of bitterness,\r\nas he caught up his gun and shouted to several men, who hurried up on\r\nseeing our hero's burst into camp.\r\n\r\n\"Ten-mile Creek!\" muttered Dick.  \"I'll bring 'em in, though,\" he\r\ncontinued, glancing at several of the camp horses that grazed close at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was on Charlie's back, the line of one of the best\r\nhorses was in his hand, and almost before Cameron knew what he was about\r\nhe was flying down the valley like the wind.  Charlie often stretched\r\nout at full speed to please his young master, but seldom had he been\r\nurged forward as he was upon this occasion.  The led horse being light\r\nand wild, kept well up, and, in a marvellously short space of time, they\r\nwere at Ten-mile Creek.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Dick, wot's to do?\" inquired Joe Blunt, who was up to his knees\r\nin the water, setting a trap at the moment his friend galloped up.\r\n\r\n\"Injuns!  Where's Henri?\" demanded Dick.\r\n\r\n\"At the head o' the dam there.\"\r\n\r\nDick was off in a moment, and almost instantly returned with Henri\r\ngalloping beside him.\r\n\r\nNo word was spoken.  In time of action these men did not waste words.\r\nDuring Dick's momentary absence, Joe Blunt had caught up his rifle and\r\nexamined the priming, so that when Dick pulled up beside him, he merely\r\nlaid his hand on the saddle, saying, \"All right!\" as he vaulted on\r\nCharlie's back behind his young companion.  In another moment they were\r\naway at full speed.  The mustang seemed to feel that unwonted exertions\r\nwere required of him.  Double weighted though he was, he kept well up\r\nwith the other horse, and in less than two hours after Dick's leaving\r\nthe camp the three hunters came in sight of it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cameron had collected nearly all his forces, and put his camp\r\nin a state of defence before the Indians arrived, which they did\r\nsuddenly, and, as usual, at full gallop, to the amount of at least two\r\nhundred.  They did not at first seem disposed to hold friendly\r\nintercourse with the trappers, but assembled in a semicircle round the\r\ncamp in a menacing attitude, while one of their chiefs stepped forward\r\nto hold a palaver.  For some time the conversation on both sides was\r\npolite enough, but by degrees the Indian chief assumed an imperious\r\ntone, and demanded gifts from the trappers, taking care to enforce his\r\nrequest by hinting that thousands of his countrymen were not far\r\ndistant.  Cameron stoutly refused, and the palaver threatened to come to\r\nan abrupt and unpleasant termination just at the time that Dick and his\r\nfriends appeared on the scene of action.\r\n\r\nThe brook was cleared at a bound; the three hunters leaped from their\r\nsteeds and sprang to the front with a degree of energy that had a\r\nvisible effect on the savages, and Cameron, seizing the moment, proposed\r\nthat the two parties should smoke a pipe and hold a council.  The\r\nIndians agreed, and in a few minutes they were engaged in animated and\r\nfriendly intercourse.  The speeches were long, and the compliments paid\r\non either side were inflated, and, we fear, undeserved; but the result\r\nof the interview was, that Cameron made the Indians a present of tobacco\r\nand a few trinkets, and sent them back to their friends to tell them\r\nthat he was willing to trade with them.\r\n\r\nNext day the whole tribe arrived in the valley, and pitched their\r\ndeerskin tents on the plain opposite to the camp of the white men.\r\nTheir numbers far exceeded Cameron's expectation, and it was with some\r\nanxiety that he proceeded to strengthen his fortifications as much as\r\ncircumstances and the nature of the ground would admit.\r\n\r\nThe Indian camp, which numbered upwards of a thousand souls, was\r\narranged with great regularity, and was divided into three distinct\r\nsections, each section being composed of a separate tribe.  The Great\r\nSnake Nation at that time embraced three tribes or divisions--namely,\r\nthe Shirry-dikas, or dog-eaters; the War-are-ree-kas, or fish-eaters;\r\nand the Banattees, or robbers.  These were the most numerous and\r\npowerful Indians on the west side of the Rocky Mountains.  The\r\nShirry-dikas dwelt in the plains, and hunted the buffaloes; dressed\r\nwell; were cleanly; rich in horses; bold, independent, and good\r\nwarriors.  The War-are-ree-kas lived chiefly by fishing, and were found\r\non the banks of the rivers and lakes throughout the country.  They were\r\nmore corpulent, slovenly, and indolent than the Shirry-dikas, and more\r\npeaceful.  The Banattees, as we have before mentioned, were the robbers\r\nof the mountains.  They were a wild and contemptible race, and at enmity\r\nwith every one.  In summer they went about nearly naked.  In winter they\r\nclothed themselves in the skins of rabbits and wolves.  Being excellent\r\nmimics, they could imitate the howling of wolves, the neighing of\r\nhorses, and the cries of birds, by which means they could approach\r\ntravellers, rob them, and then fly to their rocky fastnesses in the\r\nmountains, where pursuit was vain.\r\n\r\nSuch were the men who now assembled in front of the camp of the\r\nfur-traders, and Cameron soon found that the news of his presence in the\r\ncountry had spread far and wide among the natives, bringing them to the\r\nneighbourhood of his camp in immense crowds, so that, during the next\r\nfew days, their numbers increased to thousands.\r\n\r\nSeveral long palavers quickly ensued between the red men and the white,\r\nand the two great chiefs who seemed to hold despotic rule over the\r\nassembled tribes were extremely favourable to the idea of universal\r\npeace which was propounded to them.  In several set speeches of great\r\nlength and very considerable power, these natural orators explained\r\ntheir willingness to enter into amicable relations with all the\r\nsurrounding nations as well as with the white men.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Pee-eye-em, the chief of the Shirry-dikas, a man above six\r\nfeet high, and of immense muscular strength,--\"but my tribe cannot\r\nanswer for the Banattees, who are robbers, and cannot be punished,\r\nbecause they dwell in scattered families among the mountains.  The\r\nBanattees are bad; they cannot be trusted.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the Banattees were present at the council when this was said;\r\nand if they had been it would have mattered little, for they were\r\nneither fierce nor courageous, although bold enough in their own haunts\r\nto murder and rob the unwary.\r\n\r\nThe second chief did not quite agree with Pee-eye-em; he said that it\r\nwas impossible for them to make peace with their natural enemies, the\r\nPeigans and the Blackfeet on the east side of the mountains.  It was\r\nvery desirable, he admitted, but neither of these tribes would consent\r\nto it, he felt sure.\r\n\r\nUpon this Joe blunt rose and said, \"The great chief of the\r\nWar-are-ree-kas is wise, and knows that enemies cannot be reconciled\r\nunless deputies are sent to make proposals of peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Pale-face does not know the Blackfeet,\" answered the chief.  \"Who\r\nwill go into the lands of the Blackfeet?  My young men have been sent\r\nonce and again, and their scalps are now fringes to the leggings of\r\ntheir enemies.  The War-are-ree-kas do not cross the mountains but for\r\nthe purpose of making war.\"\r\n\r\n\"The chief speaks truth,\" returned Joe, \"yet there are three men round\r\nthe council-fire who will go to the Blackfeet and the Peigans with\r\nmessages of peace from the Snakes if they wish it.\"\r\n\r\nJoe pointed to himself, Henri, and Dick as he spoke, and added, \"We\r\nthree do not belong to the camp of the fur-traders; we only lodge with\r\nthem for a time.  The Great Chief of the white men has sent us to make\r\npeace with the Red-men, and to tell them that he desires to trade with\r\nthem--to exchange hatchets, and guns, and blankets for furs.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration interested the two chiefs greatly, and after a good\r\ndeal of discussion they agreed to take advantage of Joe Blunt's offer,\r\nand appoint him as a deputy to the court of their enemies.  Having\r\narranged these matters to their satisfaction, Cameron bestowed a red\r\nflag and a blue surtout with brass buttons on each of the chiefs, and a\r\nvariety of smaller articles on the other members of the council, and\r\nsent them away in a particularly amiable frame of mind.\r\n\r\nPee-eye-em burst the blue surtout at the shoulders and elbows in putting\r\nit on, as it was much too small for his gigantic frame, but, never\r\nhaving seen such an article of apparel before, he either regarded this\r\nas the natural and proper consequence of putting it on, or was totally\r\nindifferent to it, for he merely looked at the rents with a smile of\r\nsatisfaction, while his squaw surreptitiously cut off the two back\r\nbuttons and thrust them into her bosom.\r\n\r\nBy the time the council closed the night was far advanced, and a bright\r\nmoon was shedding a flood of soft light over the picturesque and busy\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go to the Injun camp,\" said Joe to Walter Cameron, as the chiefs\r\nrose to depart.  \"The season's far enough advanced already; it's time to\r\nbe off; and if I'm to speak for the Red-skins in the Blackfeet Council,\r\nI'd need to know what to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please yourself, Master Blunt,\" answered Cameron.  \"I like your company\r\nand that of your friends, and if it suited you I would be glad to take\r\nyou along with us to the coast of the Pacific; but your mission among\r\nthe Indians is a good one, and I'll help it on all I can.  I suppose you\r\nwill go also?\" he added, turning to Dick Varley, who was still seated\r\nbeside the council-fire caressing Crusoe.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever Joe goes, I go,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\nCrusoe's tail, ears and eyes demonstrated high approval of the sentiment\r\ninvolved in this speech.\r\n\r\n\"And your friend Henri?\"\r\n\r\n\"He goes too,\" answered Joe.  \"It's as well that the Red-skins should\r\nsee the three o' us before we start for the east side o' the mountains.\r\nHo!  Henri, come here, lad.\"\r\n\r\nHenri obeyed, and in a few seconds the three friends crossed the brook\r\nto the Indian camp, and were guided to the principal lodge by\r\nPee-eye-em.  Here a great council was held, and the proposed attempt at\r\nnegotiations for peace with their ancient enemies fully discussed.\r\nWhile they were thus engaged, and just as Pee-eye-em had, in the energy\r\nof an enthusiastic peroration burst the blue surtout _almost_ up to the\r\ncollar, a distant rushing sound was heard, which caused every man to\r\nspring to his feet, run out of the tent, and seize his weapons.\r\n\r\n\"What can it be, Joe?\" whispered Dick, as they stood at the tent door\r\nleaning on their rifles, and listening intently.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno,\" answered Joe shortly.\r\n\r\nMost of the numerous fires of the camp had gone out, but the bright moon\r\nrevealed the dusky forms of thousands of Indians, whom the unwonted\r\nsound had startled, moving rapidly about.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was soon explained.  The Indian camp was pitched on an open\r\nplain of several miles in extent, which took a sudden bend half a mile\r\ndistant, where a spur of the mountains shut out the further end of the\r\nvalley from view.  From beyond this point the dull rumbling sound\r\nproceeded.  Suddenly there was a roar as if a mighty cataract had been\r\nlet loose upon the scene.  At the same moment a countless herd of wild\r\nhorses came thundering round the base of the mountain and swept over the\r\nplain straight towards the Indian camp.\r\n\r\n\"A stampedo!\" cried Joe, springing to the assistance of Pee-eye-em,\r\nwhose favourite horses were picketted near the tent.\r\n\r\nOn they came like a living torrent, and the thunder of a thousand hoofs\r\nwas soon mingled with the howling of hundreds of dogs in the camp, and\r\nthe yelling of Indians, as they vainly endeavoured to restrain the\r\nrising excitement of their steeds.  Henri and Dick stood rooted to the\r\nground, gazing in silent wonder at the fierce and uncontrollable gallop\r\nof the thousands of panic-stricken horses that bore down upon the camp\r\nwith the tumultuous violence of a mighty cataract.\r\n\r\nAs the maddened troop drew nigh, the camp horses began to snort and\r\ntremble violently, and when the rush of the wild steeds was almost upon\r\nthem, they became ungovernable with terror, broke their halters and\r\nhobbles, and dashed wildly about.  To add to the confusion at that\r\nmoment, a cloud passed over the moon and threw the whole scene into deep\r\nobscurity.  Blind with terror, which was probably increased by the din\r\nof their own mad flight, the galloping troop came on, and, with a sound\r\nlike the continuous roar of thunder that for an instant drowned the yell\r\nof dog and man, they burst upon the camp, trampling over packs and\r\nskins, and dried meat, etcetera, in their headlong speed, and\r\noverturning several of the smaller tents.  In another moment they swept\r\nout upon the plain beyond, and were soon lost in the darkness of the\r\nnight, while the yelping of dogs, as they vainly pursued them, mingled\r\nand gradually died away with the distant thunder of their retreat.\r\n\r\nThis was a \"_stampedo_,\" one of the most extraordinary scenes that can\r\nbe witnessed in the western wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"Lend a hand, Henri,\" shouted Joe, who was struggling with a powerful\r\nhorse.  \"Wot's comed over yer brains, man?  This brute 'll git off if ye\r\ndon't look sharp.\"\r\n\r\nDick and Henri both answered to the summons, and they succeeded in\r\nthrowing the struggling animal on its side and holding it down until its\r\nexcitement was somewhat abated.  Pee-eye-em had also been successful in\r\nsecuring his favourite hunter, but nearly every other horse belonging to\r\nthe camp had broken loose and joined the whirlwind gallop, but they\r\ngradually dropped out, and, before morning, the most of them were\r\nsecured by their owners.  As there were at least two thousand horses and\r\nan equal number of dogs in the part of the Indian camp which had been\r\nthus over-run by the wild mustangs, the turmoil, as may be imagined, was\r\nprodigious!  Yet, strange to say, no accident of a serious nature\r\noccurred beyond the loss of several chargers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this exciting scene there was one heart there which beat\r\nwith a nervous vehemence that well-nigh burst it.  This was the heart of\r\nDick Varley's horse, Charlie.  Well-known to him was that distant\r\nrumbling sound that floated on the night air into the fur-trader's camp\r\nwhere he was picketted close to Cameron's tent.  Many a time had he\r\nheard the approach of such a wild troop, and often, in days not long\r\ngone by, had his shrill neigh rung out as he joined and led the\r\npanic-stricken band.  He was first to hear the sound, and by his restive\r\nactions, to draw the attention of the fur-traders to it.  As a\r\nprecautionary measure they all sprang up and stood by their horses to\r\nsoothe them, but as a brook with a belt of bushes and quarter of a mile\r\nof plain intervened between their camp and the mustangs as they flew\r\npast, they had little or no trouble in restraining them.  Not so,\r\nhowever, with Charlie.  At the very moment that his master was\r\ncongratulating himself on the supposed security of his position, he\r\nwrenched the halter from the hand of him who held it, burst through the\r\nbarrier of felled trees that had been thrown round the camp, cleared the\r\nbrook at a bound, and, with a wild hilarious neigh, resumed his old\r\nplace in the ranks of the free-born mustangs of the prairie.\r\n\r\nLittle did Dick think, when the flood of horses swept past him, that his\r\nown good steed was there, rejoicing in his recovered liberty.  But\r\nCrusoe knew it.  Ay, the wind had borne down the information to his\r\nacute nose before the living storm burst upon the camp, and when Charlie\r\nrushed past with the long tough halter trailing at his heels, Crusoe\r\nsprang to his side, seized the end of the halter with his teeth, and\r\ngalloped off along with him.\r\n\r\nIt was a long gallop and a tough one, but Crusoe held on, for it was a\r\nsettled principle in his mind _never_ to give in.  At first the check\r\nupon Charlie's speed was imperceptible, but by degrees the weight of the\r\ngigantic dog began to tell, and, after a time, they fell a little to the\r\nrear; then, by good fortune, the troop passed through a mass of\r\nunderwood, and the line, getting entangled, brought their mad career\r\nforcibly to a close; the mustangs passed on, and the two friends were\r\nleft to keep each other company in the dark.\r\n\r\nHow long they would have remained thus is uncertain, for neither of them\r\nhad sagacity enough to undo a complicated entanglement; fortunately,\r\nhowever, in his energetic tugs at the line, Crusoe's sharp teeth\r\npartially severed it, and a sudden start on the part of Charlie caused\r\nit to part.  Before he could escape, Crusoe again seized the end of it\r\nand led him slowly but steadily back to the Indian camp, never halting\r\nor turning aside until he had placed the line in Dick Varley's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, pup! where have ye bin.  How did ye bring him here?\" exclaimed\r\nDick, as he gazed in amazement at his foam-covered horse.\r\n\r\nCrusoe wagged his tail, as if to say, \"Be thankful that you've got him,\r\nDick, my boy, and don't ask questions that you know I can't answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must ha' broke loose and jined the stampedo,\" remarked Joe, coming\r\nout of the chief's tent at the moment; \"but tie him up, Dick, and come\r\nin, for we want to settle about startin' to-morrow or nixt day.\"\r\n\r\nHaving fastened Charlie to a stake, and ordered Crusoe to watch him,\r\nDick re-entered the tent where the council had re-assembled, and where\r\nPee-eye-em--having, in the recent struggle, split the blue surtout\r\ncompletely up to the collar, so that his backbone was visible throughout\r\nthe greater part of its length--was holding forth in eloquent strains on\r\nthe subject of peace in general and peace with the Blackfeet, the\r\nancient enemies of the Shirry-dikas, in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nPLANS AND PROSPECTS--DICK BECOMES HOME-SICK, AND HENRI METAPHYSICAL--THE\r\nINDIANS ATTACK THE CAMP--A BLOW-UP.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Indians gave themselves up to unlimited\r\nfeasting, in consequence of the arrival of a large body of hunters with\r\nan immense supply of buffalo meat.  It was a regular day of rejoicing.\r\nUpwards of six hundred buffaloes had been killed, and as the supply of\r\nmeat before their arrival had been ample, the camp was now overflowing\r\nwith plenty.  Feasts were given by the chiefs, and the medicine-men went\r\nabout the camp uttering loud cries, which were meant to express\r\ngratitude to the Great Spirit for the bountiful supply of food.  They\r\nalso carried a portion of meat to the aged and infirm who were unable to\r\nhunt for themselves, and had no young men in their family circle to hunt\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThis arrival of the hunters was a fortunate circumstance, as it put the\r\nIndians in great good-humour, and inclined them to hold friendly\r\nintercourse with the trappers, who for some time continued to drive a\r\nbrisk trade in furs.  Having no market for the disposal of their furs,\r\nthe Indians of course had more than they knew what to do with, and were\r\ntherefore glad to exchange those of the most beautiful and valuable kind\r\nfor a mere trifle, so that the trappers laid aside their traps for a\r\ntime and devoted themselves to traffic.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joe Blunt and his friends made preparations for their return\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see,\" remarked Joe to Henri and Dick, as they sat beside the fire in\r\nPee-eye-em's lodge, and feasted on a potful of grasshopper soup, which\r\nthe great chiefs squaw had just placed before them,--\"ye see, my\r\ncalc'lations is as follows.  Wot with trappin' beavers and huntin', we\r\nthree ha' made enough to sot us up, an it likes us, in the Mustang\r\nValley--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Dick, remitting for a few seconds the use of his teeth\r\nin order to exercise his tongue,--\"ha!  Joe, but it don't like _me_!\r\nWhat, give up a hunter's life and become a farmer?  I should think not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bon!\" ejaculated Henri, but whether the remark had reference to the\r\ngrasshopper soup or the sentiment, we cannot tell.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Joe, commencing to devour a large buffalo steak with a\r\nhunter's appetite, \"ye'll please yourselves, lads, as to that; but, as I\r\nwos sayin', we've got a powerful lot o' furs, an' a big pack o' odds and\r\nends for the Injuns we chance to meet with by the way, an' powder and\r\nlead to last us a twelve-month, besides five good horses to carry us an'\r\nour packs over the plains; so if it's agreeable to you, I mean to make a\r\nbee-line for the Mustang Valley.  We're pretty sure to meet with\r\nBlackfeet on the way, and if we do we'll try to make peace between them\r\nan' the Snakes.  I 'xpect it'll be pretty well on for six weeks afore we\r\ngit to home, so we'll start to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat is fat vill do ver' vell,\" said Henri; \"vill you please donnez me\r\none petit morsel of steak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready for anything, Joe,\" cried Dick, \"you are leader.  Just point\r\nthe way, and I'll answer for two o' us followin' ye--eh! won't we,\r\nCrusoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will,\" remarked the dog quietly.\r\n\r\n\"How comes it,\" inquired Dick, \"that these Indians don't care for our\r\ntobacco?\"\r\n\r\n\"They like their own better, I s'pose,\" answered Joe; \"most all the\r\nwestern Injuns do.  They make it o' the dried leaves o' the shumack and\r\nthe inner bark o' the red-willow, chopped very small an' mixed together.\r\nThey call this stuff _Kinnekinnik_, but they like to mix about a fourth\r\no' our tobacco with it, so Pee-eye-em tells me, an' he's a good judge;\r\nthe amount that red-skinned mortal smokes _is_ oncommon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they doin' yonder?\" inquired Dick, pointing to a group of men\r\nwho had been feasting for some time past in front of a tent within sight\r\nof our trio.\r\n\r\n\"Goin' to sing, I think,\" replied Joe.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, six young warriors were seen to work their bodies about in\r\na very remarkable way, and give utterance to still more remarkable\r\nsounds, which gradually increased until the singers burst out into that\r\nterrific yell, or war-whoop, for which American savages have long been\r\nfamous.  Its effect would save been appalling to unaccustomed ears.\r\nThen they allowed their voices to die away in soft, plaintive tones,\r\nwhile their action corresponded thereto.  Suddenly the furious style was\r\nrevived, and the men wrought themselves into a condition little short of\r\nmadness, while their yells rung wildly through the camp.  This was too\r\nmuch for ordinary canine nature to withstand, so all the dogs in the\r\nneighbourhood joined in the horrible chorus.\r\n\r\nCrusoe had long since learned to treat the eccentricities of Indians and\r\ntheir curs with dignified contempt.  He paid no attention to this\r\nserenade, but lay sleeping by the fire until Dick and his companions\r\nrose to take leave of their host, and return to the camp of the\r\nfur-traders.  The remainder of that night was spent in making\r\npreparations for setting forth on the morrow, and when, at grey dawn,\r\nDick and Crusoe lay down to snatch a few hours' repose, the yells and\r\nhowling in the Snake camp were going on as vigorously as ever.\r\n\r\nThe sun had arisen, and his beams were just tipping the summits of the\r\nRocky Mountains, causing the snowy peaks to glitter like flame, and the\r\ndeep ravines and gorges to look sombre and mysterious by contrast, when\r\nDick, and Joe, and Henri mounted their gallant steeds, and, with Crusoe\r\ngambolling before, and the two pack-horses trotting by their side,\r\nturned their faces eastward, and bade adieu to the Indian camp.\r\n\r\nCrusoe was in great spirits.  He was perfectly well aware that he and\r\nhis companions were on their way home, and testified his satisfaction by\r\nbursts of scampering over the hills and valleys.  Doubtless he thought\r\nof Dick Varley's cottage, and of Dick's mild, kind-hearted mother.\r\nUndoubtedly, too, he thought of his own mother, Fan, and felt a glow of\r\nfilial affection as he did so.  Of this we feel quite certain.  He would\r\nhave been unworthy the title of hero if he hadn't.  Perchance he thought\r\nof Grumps, but of this we are not quite so sure.  We rather think, upon\r\nthe whole, that he did.\r\n\r\nDick, too, let his thoughts run away in the direction of _home_.  Sweet\r\nword!  Those who have never left it cannot, by any effort of\r\nimagination, realise the full import of the word \"home.\"  Dick was a\r\nbold hunter, but he was young, and this was his first long expedition.\r\nOftentimes, when sleeping under the trees and gazing dreamily up through\r\nthe branches at the stars, had he thought of home, until his longing\r\nheart began to yearn to return.  He repelled such tender feelings,\r\nhowever, when they became too strong, deeming them unmanly, and sought\r\nto turn his mind to the excitements of the chase, but latterly his\r\nefforts were in vain.  He became thoroughly home-sick, and, while\r\nadmitting the fact to himself, he endeavoured to conceal it from his\r\ncomrades.  He thought that he was successful in this attempt.  Poor Dick\r\nVarley! as yet he was sadly ignorant of human nature.  Henri knew it,\r\nand Joe Blunt knew it.  Even Crusoe knew that something was wrong with\r\nhis master, although he could not exactly make out what it was.  But\r\nCrusoe made memoranda in the note-book of his memory.  He jotted down\r\nthe peculiar phases of his master's new disease with the care and minute\r\nexactness of a physician; and, we doubt not, ultimately added the\r\nknowledge of the symptoms of homesickness to his already well-filled\r\nstores of erudition.\r\n\r\nIt was not till they had set out on their homeward journey that Dick\r\nVarley's spirits revived, and it was not till they reached the beautiful\r\nprairies on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, and galloped over\r\nthe green sward towards the Mustang Valley, that Dick ventured to tell\r\nJoe Blunt what his feelings had been.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye know, Joe,\" he said confidentially, reining up his gallant steed\r\nafter a sharp gallop, \"d'ye know I've bin feelin' awful low for some\r\ntime past.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, lad,\" answered Joe, with a quiet smile, in which there was a\r\ndash of something that implied he knew more than he chose to express.\r\n\r\nDick felt surprised, but he continued, \"I wonder what it could have bin.\r\nI never felt so before.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twas homesickness, boy,\" returned Joe.\r\n\r\n\"How d'ye know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same way as how I know most things, by experience an' obsarvation.\r\nI've bin home-sick myself once--but it was long, long agone.\"\r\n\r\nDick felt much relieved at this candid confession by such a bronzed\r\nveteran, and, the chords of sympathy having been struck, he opened up\r\nhis heart at once, to the evident delight of Henri, who, among other\r\ncurious partialities, was extremely fond of listening to and taking part\r\nin conversations that bordered on the metaphysical, and were hard to be\r\nunderstood.  Most conversations that were not connected with eating and\r\nhunting were of this nature to Henri.\r\n\r\n\"Hom'-sik,\" he cried, \"veech mean bein' sik of hom'! hah! dat is fat I\r\nam always be, ven I goes hout on de expedition.  Oui, vraiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always packs up,\" continued Joe, paying no attention to Henri's\r\nremark,--\"I always packs up an' sots off for home when I gits home-sick;\r\nit's the best cure, an' when hunters are young like you, Dick, it's the\r\nonly cure.  I've know'd fellers a'most die o' homesickness, an' I'm told\r\nthey _do_ go under altogether sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go onder!\" exclaimed Henri; \"oui, I vas all but die myself ven I fust\r\ntry to git away from hom'.  If I have not git away, I not be here\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\nHenri's idea of homesickness was so totally opposed to theirs, that his\r\ncomrades only laughed, and refrained from attempting to set him right.\r\n\r\n\"The fust time I was took bad with it wos in a country somethin' like\r\nthat,\" said Joe, pointing to the wide stretch of undulating prairie,\r\ndotted with clusters of trees and wandering streamlets, that lay before\r\nthem; \"I had bin out about two months, an wos makin' a good thing of it,\r\nfor game wos plenty, when I began to think somehow more than usual o'\r\nhome.  My mother wos alive then.\"\r\n\r\nJoe's voice sank to a deep, solemn tone as he said this, and for a few\r\nminutes he rode on in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it grew worse and worse, I dreamed o' home all night, an' thought\r\nof it all day, till I began to shoot bad, an' my comrades wos gittin'\r\ntired o' me; so says I to them one night, says I, `I give out, lads,\r\nI'll make tracks for the settlement to-morrow.'  They tried to laugh me\r\nout of it at first, but it was no go, so I packed up, bid them good-day,\r\nan' sot off alone on a trip o' five hundred miles.  The very first mile\r\no' the way back I began to mend, and before two days I wos all right\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nJoe was interrupted at this point by the sudden appearance of a solitary\r\nhorseman on the brow of an eminence not half a mile distant.  The three\r\nfriends instantly drove their pack-horses behind a clump of trees, but\r\nnot in time to escape the vigilant eye of the Red-man, who uttered a\r\nloud shout, which brought up a band of his comrades at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, Henri,\" cried Joe Blunt, \"our errand is one of _peace_.\"\r\n\r\nThe caution was needed, for in the confusion of the moment Henri was\r\nmaking preparation to sell his life as dearly as possible.  Before\r\nanother word could be uttered, they were surrounded by a troop of about\r\ntwenty yelling Blackfeet Indians.  They were, fortunately, not a\r\nwar-party, and, still more fortunately, they were peaceably disposed,\r\nand listened to the preliminary address of Joe Blunt with exemplary\r\npatience; after which the two parties encamped on the spot, the\r\ncouncil-fire was lighted, and every preparation made for a long palaver.\r\n\r\nWe will not trouble the reader with the details of what was said on this\r\noccasion.  The party of Indians was a small one, and no chief of any\r\nimportance was attached to it.  Suffice it to say that the pacific\r\novertures made by Joe were well received, the trifling gifts made\r\nthereafter were still better received, and they separated with mutual\r\nexpressions of good will.\r\n\r\nSeveral other bands which were afterwards met with were equally\r\nfriendly, and only one war-party was seen.  Joe's quick eye observed it\r\nin time to enable them to retire unseen behind the shelter of some\r\ntrees, where they remained until the Indian warriors were out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe next party they met with, however, were more difficult to manage,\r\nand, unfortunately, blood was shed on both sides before our travellers\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of a beautiful day that a war-party of Blackfeet\r\nwere seen riding along a ridge on the horizon.  It chanced that the\r\nprairie at this place was almost destitute of trees or shrubs large\r\nenough to conceal the horses.  By dashing down the grassy wave into the\r\nhollow between the two undulations, and dismounting, Joe hoped to elude\r\nthe savages, so he gave the word,--but at the same moment a shout from\r\nthe Indians told that they were discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Look sharp, lads, throw down the packs on the highest point of the\r\nridge,\" cried Joe, undoing the lashings, seizing one of the bales of\r\ngoods, and hurrying to the top of the undulation with it; \"we must keep\r\nthem at arm's length, boys--be alive.  War-parties are not to be\r\ntrusted.\"\r\n\r\nDick and Henri seconded Joe's efforts so ably, that in the course of two\r\nminutes the horses were unloaded, the packs piled in the form of a wall\r\nin front of a broken piece of ground, the horses picketted close beside\r\nthem, and our three travellers peeping over the edge, with their rifles\r\ncocked, while the savages--about thirty in number--came sweeping down\r\ntowards them.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to git them to palaver,\" said Joe Blunt, \"but keep yer eye on\r\n'em, Dick, an' if they behave ill, shoot the _horse_ o' the leadin'\r\nchief.  I'll throw up my left hand as a signal.  Mind, lad, don't hit\r\nhuman flesh till my second signal is given, and see that Henri don't\r\ndraw till I git back to ye.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Joe sprang lightly over the slight parapet of their little\r\nfortress, and ran swiftly out, unarmed, towards the Indians.  In a few\r\nseconds he was close up with them, and in another moment was surrounded.\r\nAt first the savages brandished their spears and rode round the\r\nsolitary man, yelling like fiends, as if they wished to intimidate him;\r\nbut as Joe stood like a statue, with his arms crossed, and a grave\r\nexpression of contempt on his countenance, they quickly desisted, and,\r\ndrawing near, asked him where he came from, and what he was doing there.\r\n\r\nJoe's story was soon told; but instead of replying, they began to shout\r\nvociferously, and evidently meant mischief.\r\n\r\n\"If the Blackfeet are afraid to speak to the Pale-face, he will go back\r\nto his braves,\" said Joe, passing suddenly between two of the warriors\r\nand taking a few steps towards the camp.\r\n\r\nInstantly every bow was bent, and it seemed as if our bold hunter were\r\nabout to be pierced by a hundred arrows, when he turned round and\r\ncried:--\r\n\r\n\"The Blackfeet must not advance a single step.  The first that moves his\r\n_horse_ shall die.  The second that moves _himself_ shall die.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Blackfoot chief replied scornfully, \"The Pale-face talks\r\nwith a big mouth.  We do not believe his words.  The Snakes are liars,\r\nwe will make no peace with them.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet speaking, Joe threw up his hand; there was a loud\r\nreport, and the noble horse of the savage chief lay struggling in death\r\nagony on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe use of the rifle, as we have before hinted, was little known at this\r\nperiod among the Indians of the far west, and many had never heard the\r\ndreaded report before, although all were aware, from hearsay, of its\r\nfatal power.  The fall of the chief's horse, therefore, quite paralysed\r\nthem for a few moments, and they had not recovered from their surprise\r\nwhen a second report was heard, a bullet whistled past, and a second\r\nhorse fell.  At the same moment there was a loud explosion in the camp\r\nof the Pale-faces, a white cloud enveloped it, and from the midst of\r\nthis a loud shriek was heard, as Dick, Henri, and Crusoe bounded over\r\nthe packs with frantic gestures.\r\n\r\nAt this the gaping savages wheeled their steeds round, the dismounted\r\nhorsemen sprang on behind two of their comrades, and the whole band\r\ndashed away over the plains as if they were chased by evil spirits.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joe hastened towards his comrades in a state of great anxiety,\r\nfor he knew at once that one of the powder-horns must have been\r\naccidentally blown up.\r\n\r\n\"No damage done, boys, I hope?\" he cried on coming up.\r\n\r\n\"Damage!\" cried Henri, holding his hands tight over his face.  \"Oh! oui,\r\ngreat damage--moche damage, me two eyes be blowed out of dere holes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so bad as that, I hope,\" said Dick, who was very slightly\r\nsinged, and forgot his own hurts in anxiety about his comrade.  \"Let me\r\nsee?\"\r\n\r\n\"My eye!\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, while a broad grin overspread his\r\ncountenance, \"ye've not improved yer looks, Henri.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true.  The worthy hunter's hair was singed to such an extent\r\nthat his entire countenance presented the appearance of a universal\r\nfrizzle.  Fortunately the skin, although much blackened, was quite\r\nuninjured, a fact which, when he ascertained it beyond a doubt, afforded\r\nso much satisfaction to Henri, that he capered about shouting with\r\ndelight, as if some piece of good fortune had befallen him.\r\n\r\nThe accident had happened in consequence of Henri having omitted to\r\nreplace the stopper of his powder-horn, and when, in his anxiety for\r\nJoe, he fired at random amongst the Indians, despite Dick's entreaties\r\nto wait, a spark communicated with the powder-horn and blew him up.\r\nDick and Crusoe were only a little singed, but the former was not\r\ndisposed to quarrel with an accident which had sent their enemies so\r\npromptly to the right-about.\r\n\r\nThis band followed them for some nights, in the hope of being able to\r\nsteal their horses while they slept; but they were not brave enough to\r\nventure a second time within range of the death-dealing rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nDANGERS OF THE PRAIRIE--OUR TRAVELLERS ATTACKED BY INDIANS, AND\r\nDELIVERED IN A REMARKABLE MANNER.\r\n\r\nThere are periods in the life of almost all men when misfortunes seem to\r\ncrowd upon them in rapid succession, when they escape from one danger\r\nonly to encounter another, and when, to use a well-known expression,\r\nthey succeed in leaping out of the frying-pan at the expense of plunging\r\ninto the fire.\r\n\r\nSo was it with our three friends upon this occasion.  They were scarcely\r\nrid of the Blackfeet, who found them too watchful to be caught napping,\r\nwhen, about daybreak one morning they encountered a roving band of\r\nCamanchee Indians, who wore such a warlike aspect that Joe deemed it\r\nprudent to avoid them if possible.\r\n\r\n\"They don't see us yit, I guess,\" said Joe, as he and his companions\r\ndrove the horses into a hollow between the grassy waves of the prairie,\r\n\"any if we only can escape their sharp eyes till we're in yonder clump\r\no' willows, we're safe enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you ride up to them, Joe,\" inquired Dick, \"and make peace\r\nbetween them and the Pale-faces, as you ha' done with other bands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it's o' no use to risk our scalps for the chance o' makin'\r\npeace wi' a rovin' war-party.  Keep yer head down, Henri!  If they git\r\nonly a sight o' the top o' yer cap, they'll be down on us like a breeze\r\no' _wind_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! let dem come!\" said Henri.\r\n\r\n\"They'll come without askin' yer leave,\" remarked Joe drily.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his defiant expression, Henri had sufficient prudence to\r\ninduce him to bend his head and shoulders, and in a few minutes they\r\nreached the shelter of the willows unseen by the savages.  At least so\r\nthought Henri, Joe was not quite sure about it, and Dick hoped for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nIn the course of half an hour the last of the Camanchees was seen to\r\nhover for a second on the horizon, like a speck of black against the\r\nsky, and then to disappear.\r\n\r\nImmediately the three hunters bolted on their steeds and resumed their\r\njourney; but before that evening closed they had sad evidence of the\r\nsavage nature of the band from which they had escaped.  On passing the\r\nbrow of a slight eminence, Dick, who rode first, observed that Crusoe\r\nstopped and snuffed the breeze in an anxious, inquiring manner.\r\n\r\n\"What is't, pup?\" said Dick, drawing up, for he knew that his faithful\r\ndog never gave a false alarm.\r\n\r\nCrusoe replied by a short, uncertain bark, and then bounding forward,\r\ndisappeared behind a little wooded knoll.  In another moment a long,\r\ndismal howl floated over the plains.  There was a mystery about the\r\ndog's conduct which, coupled with his melancholy cry, struck the\r\ntravellers with a superstitious feeling of dread, as they sat looking at\r\neach other in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's clear it up,\" cried Joe Blunt, shaking the reins of his\r\nsteed, and galloping forward.  A few strides brought them to the other\r\nside of the knoll where, scattered upon the torn and bloody turf, they\r\ndiscovered the scalped and mangled remains of about twenty or thirty\r\nhuman beings.  Their skulls had been cleft by the tomahawk, and their\r\nbreasts pierced by the scalping-knife; and from the position in which\r\nmany of them lay, it was evident that they had been slain while asleep.\r\n\r\nJoe's brow flushed, and his lips became tightly compressed, as he\r\nmuttered between his set teeth, \"Their skins are white.\"\r\n\r\nA short examination sufficed to show that the men who had thus been\r\nbarbarously murdered while they slept had been a band of trappers, or\r\nhunters; but what their errand had been, or whence they came, they could\r\nnot discover.\r\n\r\nEverything of value had been carried off, and all the scalps had been\r\ntaken.  Most of the bodies, although much mutilated, lay in a posture\r\nthat led our hunters to believe they had been killed while asleep; but\r\none or two were cut almost to pieces, and from the blood-bespattered and\r\ntrampled sward around, it seemed as if they had struggled long and\r\nfiercely for life.  Whether or not any of the savages had been slain, it\r\nwas impossible to tell, for if such had been the case, their comrades,\r\ndoubtless, had carried away their bodies.  That they had been\r\nslaughtered by the party of Camanchees who had been seen at daybreak,\r\nwas quite clear to Joe; but his burning desire to revenge the death of\r\nthe white men had to be stifled, as his party was so small.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards it was discovered that this was a band of trappers who,\r\nlike those mentioned at the beginning of this volume, had set out to\r\navenge the death of a comrade; but God, who has retained the right of\r\nvengeance in His own hand, saw fit to frustrate their purpose, by giving\r\nthem into the hands of the savages whom they had set forth to slay.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to bury so many bodies, the travellers resumed\r\ntheir journey, and left them to bleach there in the wilderness; but they\r\nrode the whole of that day almost without uttering a word.  Meanwhile\r\nthe Camanchees, who had observed the trio, and had ridden away at first\r\nfor the purpose of deceiving them into the belief that they had passed\r\nunobserved, doubled on their track, and took a long sweep in order to\r\nkeep out of sight until they could approach under the shelter of a belt\r\nof woodland towards which the travellers now approached.\r\n\r\nThe Indians adopted this course instead of the easier method of simply\r\npursuing so weak a party, because the plains at this part were bordered\r\nby a long stretch of forest into which the hunters could have plunged,\r\nand rendered pursuit more difficult, if not almost useless.  The detour\r\nthus taken was so extensive that the shades of evening were beginning to\r\ndescend before they could put their plan into execution.  The forest lay\r\nabout a mile to the right of our hunters, like some dark mainland, of\r\nwhich the prairie was the sea, and the scattered clumps of wood the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\"There's no lack o' game here,\" said Dick Varley, pointing to a herd of\r\nbuffaloes which rose at their approach, and fled away towards the wood.\r\n\r\n\"I think we'll ha' thunder soon,\" remarked Joe.  \"I never feel it\r\nonnatteral hot like this without looking out for a plump.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! den ve better look hout for one goot tree to get b'low,\" suggested\r\nHenri.  \"Voila!\" he added, pointing with his finger towards the plain;\r\n\"dere am a lot of wild hosses.\"\r\n\r\nA troop of about thirty wild horses appeared, as he spoke, on the brow\r\nof a ridge, and advanced slowly towards them.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" exclaimed Joe, reining up; \"hold on, lads.  Wild horses! my\r\nrifle to a pop-gun there's wilder men on t'other side o' them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, Joe?\" inquired Dick, riding close up.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye see the little lumps on the shoulder o' each horse?\" said Joe.\r\n\"Them's Injun's _feet_; an' if we don't want to lose our scalps we'd\r\nbetter make for the forest.\"\r\n\r\nJoe proved himself to be in earnest by wheeling round and making\r\nstraight for the thick woods as fast as his horse could run.  The others\r\nfollowed, driving the pack-horses before them.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this sudden movement on the so-called \"wild horses\" was\r\nvery remarkable, and to one unacquainted with the habits of the\r\nCamanchee Indians, must have appeared almost supernatural.  In the\r\ntwinkling of an eye every steed had a rider on its back, and before the\r\nhunters had taken five strides in the direction of the forest, the whole\r\nband were in hot pursuit, yelling like furies.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these Indians accomplish this feat is very singular,\r\nand implies great activity and strength of muscle on the part of the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThe Camanchees are low in stature, and usually are rather corpulent.  In\r\ntheir movements on foot they are heavy and ungraceful, and they are, on\r\nthe whole, a slovenly and unattractive race of men.  But the instant\r\nthey mount their horses they seem to be entirely changed, and surprise\r\nthe spectator with the ease and elegance of their movements.  Their\r\ngreat and distinctive peculiarity as horsemen is the power they have\r\nacquired of throwing themselves suddenly on either side of their horse's\r\nbody, and clinging on in such a way that no part of them is visible from\r\nthe other side save the foot by which they cling.  In this manner they\r\napproach their enemies at full gallop, and without rising again to the\r\nsaddle, discharge their arrows at them over their horses' backs, or even\r\nunder their necks.\r\n\r\nThis apparently magical feat is accomplished by means of a halter of\r\nhorsehair, which is passed round under the neck of the horse, and both\r\nends braided into the mane, on the withers, thus forming a loop which\r\nhangs under the neck and against the breast.  This being caught by the\r\nhand, makes a sling, into which the elbow falls, taking the weight of\r\nthe body on the middle of the upper arm.  Into this loop the rider drops\r\nsuddenly and fearlessly, leaving his heel to hang over the horse's back,\r\nto steady him, and also to restore him to his seat when desired.\r\n\r\nBy this stratagem the Indians had approached on the present occasion\r\nalmost within rifle range before they were discovered, and it required\r\nthe utmost speed of the hunters' horses to enable them to avoid being\r\novertaken.  One of the Indians, who was better mounted than his fellows,\r\ngained on the fugitives so much that he came within arrow range, but\r\nreserved his shaft until they were close on the margin of the wood,\r\nwhen, being almost alongside of Henri, he fitted an arrow to his bow.\r\nHenri's eye was upon him, however; letting go the line of the pack-horse\r\nwhich he was leading, he threw forward his rifle, but at the same moment\r\nthe savage disappeared behind his horse, and an arrow whizzed past the\r\nhunter's ear.\r\n\r\nHenri fired at the horse, which dropped instantly, hurling the\r\nastonished Camanchee upon the ground, where he lay for some time\r\ninsensible.  In a few seconds pursued and pursuers entered the wood,\r\nwhere both had to advance with caution, in order to avoid being swept\r\noff by the overhanging branches of the trees.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sultry heat of which Joe had formerly spoken increased\r\nconsiderably, and a rumbling noise, as if of distant thunder, was heard;\r\nbut the flying hunters paid no attention to it, for the led horses gave\r\nthem so much trouble, and retarded their flight so much, that the\r\nIndians were gradually and visibly gaining on them.\r\n\r\n\"We'll ha' to let the packs go,\" said Joe, somewhat bitterly, as he\r\nlooked over his shoulder.  \"Our scalps 'll pay for't if we don't.\"\r\n\r\nHenri uttered a peculiar and significant _hiss_ between his teeth, as he\r\nsaid, \"P'raps ve better stop and fight!\"\r\n\r\nDick said nothing, being resolved to do exactly what Joe Blunt bid him;\r\nand Crusoe, for reasons best known to himself, also said nothing, but\r\nbounded along beside his master's horse, casting an occasional glance\r\nupwards to catch any signal that might be given.\r\n\r\nThey had passed over a considerable space of ground, and were forcing\r\ntheir way, at the imminent hazard of their necks, through a\r\ndensely-clothed part of the wood, when the sound above referred to\r\nincreased, attracting the attention of both parties.  In a few seconds\r\nthe air was filled with a steady and continuous rumbling sound, like the\r\nnoise of a distant cataract.  Pursuers and fugitives drew rein\r\ninstinctively, and came to a dead stand, while the rumbling increased to\r\na roar, and evidently approached them rapidly, though as yet nothing to\r\ncause it could be seen, except that there was a dense, dark cloud\r\noverspreading the sky to the southward.  The air was oppressively still\r\nand hot.\r\n\r\n\"What can't be?\" inquired Dick, looking at Joe, who was gazing with an\r\nexpression of wonder, not unmixed with concern, at the southern sky.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno, boy.  I've bin more in the woods than in the clearin' in my day,\r\nbut I niver heerd the likes o' that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It am like t'ondre,\" said Henri; \"mais it nevair do stop.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true.  The sound was similar to continuous, uninterrupted\r\nthunder.  On it came with a magnificent roar that shook the very earth,\r\nand revealed itself at last in the shape of a mighty whirlwind.  In a\r\nmoment the distant woods bent before it, and fell like grass before the\r\nscythe.  It was a whirling hurricane, accompanied by a deluge of rain\r\nsuch as none of the party had ever before witnessed.  Steadily,\r\nfiercely, irresistibly, it bore down upon them, while the crash of\r\nfalling, snapping, and uprooting trees mingled with the dire artillery\r\nof that sweeping storm like the musketry on a battle-field.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, lads!\" shouted Joe, turning his horse and dashing at full\r\nspeed towards a rocky eminence that offered shelter.  But shelter was\r\nnot needed.  The storm was clearly defined.  Its limits were as\r\ndistinctly marked by its Creator as if it had been a living intelligence\r\nsent forth to put a belt of desolation round the world; and, although\r\nthe edge of devastation was not five hundred yards from the rock behind\r\nwhich the hunters were stationed, only a few drops of ice-cold rain fell\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIt passed directly between the Camanchee Indians and their intended\r\nvictims, placing between them a barrier which it would have taken days\r\nto cut through.  The storm blew for an hour, then it travelled onward in\r\nits might, and was lost in distance.  Whence it came and whither it went\r\nnone could tell; but, far as the eye could see on either hand, an avenue\r\na quarter of a mile wide was cut through the forest.  It had levelled\r\neverything with the dust; the very grass was beaten flat, the trees were\r\ntorn, shivered, snapped across, and crushed; and the earth itself in\r\nmany places was ploughed up and furrowed with deep scars.  The chaos was\r\nindescribable, and it is probable that centuries will not quite\r\nobliterate the work of that single hour.\r\n\r\nWhile it lasted, Joe and his comrades remained speechless and\r\nawe-stricken.  When it passed, no Indians were to be seen.  So our\r\nhunters remounted their steeds, and, with feelings of gratitude to God\r\nfor having delivered them alike from savage foes and from the\r\ndestructive power of the whirlwind, resumed their journey towards the\r\nMustang Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nANXIOUS FEARS FOLLOWED BY A JOYFUL SURPRISE--SAFE HOME AT LAST, AND\r\nHAPPY HEARTS.\r\n\r\nOne fine afternoon, a few weeks after the storm of which we have given\r\nan account in the last chapter, old Mrs Varley was seated beside her\r\nown chimney corner in the little cottage by the lake, gazing at the\r\nglowing logs with the earnest expression of one whose thoughts were far\r\naway.  Her kind face was paler than usual, and her hands rested idly on\r\nher knee, grasping the knitting wires to which was attached a\r\nhalf-finished stocking.\r\n\r\nOn a stool near to her sat young Marston, the lad to whom, on the day of\r\nthe shooting match, Dick Varley had given his old rifle.  The boy had an\r\nanxious look about him, as he lifted his eyes from time to time to the\r\nwidow's face.\r\n\r\n\"Did ye say, my boy, that they were _all_ killed?\" inquired Mrs Varley,\r\nawaking from her reverie with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Every one,\" replied Marston.  \"Jim Scraggs, who brought the news, said\r\nthey wos all lyin' dead with their scalps off.  They wos a party o'\r\nwhite men.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Varley sighed again, and her face assumed an expression of anxious\r\npain as she thought of her son Dick being exposed to a similar fate.\r\nMrs Varley was not given to nervous fears; but as she listened to the\r\nboy's recital of the slaughter of a party of white men, news of which\r\nhad just reached the valley, her heart sank, and she prayed inwardly to\r\nHim who is the husband of the widow that her dear one might be protected\r\nfrom the ruthless hand of the savage.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, during which young Marston fidgeted about and\r\nlooked concerned, as if he had something to say which he would fain\r\nleave unsaid, Mrs Varley continued:--\r\n\r\n\"Was it far off where the bloody deed was done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; three weeks off, I believe.  And Jim Scraggs said that he found a\r\nknife that looked like the one wot belonged to--to--\" the lad hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"To whom, my boy?  Why don't ye go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"To your son Dick.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow's hands dropped by her side, and she would have fallen had not\r\nMarston caught her.\r\n\r\n\"O mother dear, don't take on like that!\" he cried, smoothing down the\r\nwidow's hair as her head rested on his breast.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mrs Varley suffered the boy to fondle her in silence,\r\nwhile her breast laboured with anxious dread.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all,\" she said at last, recovering a little.  \"Did Jim see--\r\nDick?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the boy.  \"He looked at all the bodies, but did not find\r\nhis; so he sent me over here to tell ye that p'raps he's escaped.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Varley breathed more freely, and earnestly thanked God; but her\r\nfears soon returned when she thought of his being a prisoner, and\r\nrecalled the tales of terrible cruelty often related of the savages.\r\n\r\nWhile she was still engaged in closely questioning the lad, Jim Scraggs\r\nhimself entered the cottage, and endeavoured in a gruff sort of way to\r\nre-assure the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see, mistress,\" he said, \"Dick is a oncommon tough customer, an' if\r\nhe could only git fifty yards start, there's not a Injun in the west as\r\ncould git hold o' him agin; so don't be takin' on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if he's bin taken prisoner?\" said the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's jest wot I've comed about.  Ye see it's not onlikely he's\r\nbin took; so about thirty o' the lads o' the valley are ready jest now\r\nto start away and give the red riptiles chase, an' I come to tell ye; so\r\nkeep up heart, mistress.\"\r\n\r\nWith this parting word of comfort, Jim withdrew, and Marston soon\r\nfollowed, leaving the widow to weep and pray in solitude.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an animated scene was going on near the block-house.  Here\r\nthirty of the young hunters of the Mustang Valley were assembled,\r\nactively engaged in supplying themselves with powder and lead, and\r\ntightening their girths, preparatory to setting out in pursuit of the\r\nIndians who had murdered the white men, while hundreds of boys and\r\ngirls, and not a few matrons, crowded round and listened to the\r\nconversation, and to the deep threats of vengeance that were uttered\r\never and anon by the younger men.\r\n\r\nMajor Hope, too, was among them.  The worthy major, unable to restrain\r\nhis roving propensities, determined to revisit the Mustang Valley, and\r\nhad arrived only two days before.\r\n\r\nBackwoodsmen's preparations are usually of the shortest and simplest.\r\nIn a few minutes the cavalcade was ready, and away they went towards the\r\nprairies, with the bold major at their head.  But their journey was\r\ndestined to come to an abrupt and unexpected close.  A couple of hours'\r\ngallop brought them to the edge of one of those open plains which\r\nsometimes break up the woodland near the verge of the great prairies.\r\nIt stretched out like a green lake towards the horizon, on which, just\r\nas the band of horsemen reached it, the sun was descending in a blaze of\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nWith a shout of enthusiasm, several of the younger members of the party\r\nsprang forward into the plain at a gallop; but the shout was mingled\r\nwith one of a different tone from the older men.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!--hallo!--hold on, ye cat-a-mounts!  There's Injuns ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole band came to a sudden halt at this cry, and watched eagerly,\r\nand for some time in silence, the motions of a small party of horsemen\r\nwho were seen in the far distance, like black specks on the golden sky.\r\n\r\n\"They come this way, I think,\" said Major Hope, after gazing steadfastly\r\nat them for some minutes.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the old hands signified their assent to this suggestion by a\r\ngrunt, although to unaccustomed eyes the objects in question looked more\r\nlike crows than horsemen, and their motion was for some time scarcely\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\n\"I sees pack-horses among them,\" cried young Marston in an excited tone;\r\n\"an' there's three riders; but there's somethin' else, only wot it be I\r\ncan't tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye've sharp eyes, younker,\" remarked one of the men, \"an' I do b'lieve\r\nyer right.\"\r\n\r\nPresently the horsemen approached, and soon there was a brisk fire of\r\nguessing as to who they could be.  It was evident that the strangers\r\nobserved the cavalcade of white men, and regarded them as friends, for\r\nthey did not check the headlong speed at which they approached.  In a\r\nfew minutes they were clearly made out to be a party of three horsemen\r\ndriving pack-horses before them, and _somethin'_ which some of the\r\nhunters guessed was a buffalo calf.\r\n\r\nYoung Marston guessed too, but his guess was different.  Moreover, it\r\nwas uttered with a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest of\r\nall the savages.  \"Crusoe!\" he shouted, while at the same moment he\r\nbrought his whip heavily down on the flank of his little horse, and\r\nsprang over the prairie like an arrow.\r\n\r\nOne of the approaching horsemen was far ahead of his comrades, and\r\nseemed as if encircled with the flying and voluminous mane of his\r\nmagnificent horse.\r\n\r\n\"Hah! ho!\" gasped Marston in a low tone to himself, as he flew along.\r\n\"Crusoe!  I'd know ye, dog, among a thousand!  A buffalo calf!  Ha! git\r\non with ye!\"\r\n\r\nThis last part of the remark was addressed to his horse, and was\r\nfollowed by a whack that increased the pace considerably.\r\n\r\nThe space between two such riders was soon devoured.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Dick,--Dick Varley!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! why, Marston, my boy!\"\r\n\r\nThe friends reined up so suddenly, that one might have fancied they had\r\nmet like the knights of old in the shock of mortal conflict.\r\n\r\n\"Is't yerself, Dick Varley?\"\r\n\r\nDick held out his hand, and his eyes glistened, but he could not find\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nMarston seized it, and pushing his horse close up, vaulted nimbly off\r\nand alighted on Charlie's back behind his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Off ye go, Dick!  I'll take ye to yer mother.\"\r\n\r\nWithout reply, Dick shook the reins, and in another minute was in the\r\nmidst of the hunters.\r\n\r\nTo the numberless questions that were put to him he only waited to shout\r\naloud, \"We're all safe!  They'll tell ye all about it,\" he added,\r\npointing to his comrades, who were now close at hand; and then, dashing\r\nonward, made straight for home, with little Marston clinging to his\r\nwaist like a monkey.\r\n\r\nCharlie was fresh, and so was Crusoe; so you may be sure it was not long\r\nbefore they all drew up opposite the door of the widow's cottage.\r\nBefore Dick could dismount, Marston had slipped off, and was already in\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Dick, mother!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was an orphan, and loved the widow so much that he had come at\r\nlast to call her mother.\r\n\r\nBefore another word could be uttered, Dick Varley was in the room.\r\nMarston immediately stepped out, and softly shut the door.  Reader, we\r\nshall not open it!\r\n\r\nHaving shut the door, as we have said, Marston ran down to the edge of\r\nthe lake, and yelled with delight--usually terminating each paroxysm\r\nwith the Indian war-whoop, with which he was well acquainted.  Then he\r\ndanced, and then he sat down on a rock, and became suddenly aware that\r\nthere were other hearts there, close beside him, as glad as his own.\r\nAnother mother of the Mustang Valley was rejoicing over a long-lost son.\r\n\r\nCrusoe and his mother Fan were scampering round each other in a manner\r\nthat evinced powerfully the strength of their mutual affection.\r\n\r\nTalk of holding converse!  Every hair on Crusoe's body, every motion of\r\nhis limbs, was eloquent with silent language.  He gazed into his\r\nmother's mild eyes as if he would read her inmost soul (supposing that\r\nshe had one).  He turned his head to every possible angle, and cocked\r\nhis ears to every conceivable elevation, and rubbed his nose against\r\nFan's, and barked softly, in every imaginable degree of modulation, and\r\nvaried these proceedings by bounding away at full speed over the rocks\r\nof the beach, and in among the bushes and out again, but always circling\r\nround and round Fan, and keeping her in view!\r\n\r\nIt was a sight worth seeing, and young Marston sat down on a rock,\r\ndeliberately and enthusiastically, to gloat over it.  But perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable part of it has not yet been referred to.  There was yet\r\nanother heart there that was glad--exceeding glad--that day.  It was a\r\nlittle one too, but it was big for the body that held it.  Grumps was\r\nthere, and all that Grumps did was to sit on his haunches and stare at\r\nFan and Crusoe, and wag his tail as well as he could in so awkward a\r\nposition!  Grumps was evidently bewildered with delight, and had lost\r\nnearly all power to express it.  Crusoe's conduct towards him, too, was\r\nnot calculated to clear his faculties.  Every time he chanced to pass\r\nnear Grumps in his elephantine gambols, he gave him a passing touch with\r\nhis nose, which always knocked him head over heels; whereat Grumps\r\ninvariably got up quickly and wagged his tail with additional energy.\r\nBefore the feelings of those canine friends were calmed, they were all\r\nthree ruffled into a state of comparative exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThen young Marston called Crusoe to him, and Crusoe, obedient to the\r\nvoice of friendship, went.\r\n\r\n\"Are you happy, my dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a stupid fellow to ask such a question; however, it's an amiable\r\none.  Yes, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do _you_ want, ye small bundle o' hair?\"\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Grumps, who came forward innocently, and sat down\r\nto listen to the conversation.\r\n\r\nOn being thus sternly questioned, the little dog put down its ears flat,\r\nand hung its head, looking up at the same time with a deprecatory look\r\nas if to say, \"Oh, dear!  I beg pardon; I--I only want to sit near\r\nCrusoe, please, but if you wish it I'll go away, sad and lonely, with my\r\ntail _very_ much between my legs--indeed I will, only say the word,\r\nbut--but I'd _rather_ stay if I might.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor bundle!\" said Marston, patting its head, \"you can stay then.\r\nHooray!  Crusoe, are you happy, I say?  Does your heart bound in you\r\nlike a cannon ball that wants to find its way out and can't--eh?\"\r\n\r\nCrusoe put his snout against Marston's cheek, and, in the excess of his\r\njoy, the lad threw his arms round the dog's neck and hugged it\r\nvigorously, a piece of impulsive affection which that noble animal bore\r\nwith characteristic meekness, and which Grumps regarded with idiotic\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nREJOICINGS--THE FEAST AT THE BLOCK-HOUSE--GRUMPS AND CRUSOE COME OUT\r\nSTRONG--THE CLOSING SCENE.\r\n\r\nThe day of Dick's arrival with his companions was a great day in the\r\nannals of the Mustang Valley, and Major Hope resolved to celebrate it by\r\nan impromptu festival at the old block-house; for many hearts in the\r\nvalley had been made glad that day, and he knew full well that, under\r\nsuch circumstances, some safety-valve must be devised for the escape of\r\noverflowing excitement.\r\n\r\nA messenger was sent round to invite the population to assemble without\r\ndelay in front of the block-house.  With backwoods-like celerity the\r\nsummons was obeyed; men, women, and children hurried towards the central\r\npoint wondering, yet more than half suspecting, what was the major's\r\nobject in calling them together.\r\n\r\nThey were not long in doubt.  The first sight that presented itself as\r\nthey came trooping up the slope in front of the log hut, was an ox\r\nroasting whole before a gigantic bonfire.  Tables were being\r\nextemporised on the broad level plot in front of the gate.  Other fires\r\nthere were, of smaller dimensions, on which sundry steaming pots were\r\nplaced, and various joints of wild horse, bear, and venison roasted, and\r\nsent forth a savoury odour as well as a pleasant hissing noise.  The\r\ninhabitants of the block-house were self-taught brewers, and the result\r\nof their recent labours now stood displayed in a row of goodly casks of\r\nbeer--the only beverage with which the dwellers in these far-off regions\r\nwere wont to regale themselves.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene--as the cooks moved actively about upon the lawn, and\r\nchildren romped round the fires, and settlers came flocking through the\r\nforests--might have recalled the revelry of merry England in the olden\r\ntime, though the costumes of the far west were, perhaps, somewhat\r\ndifferent from those of old England.\r\n\r\nNo one of all the band assembled there on that day of rejoicing required\r\nto ask what it was all about.  Had any one been in doubt for a moment, a\r\nglance at the centre of the crowd assembled round the gate of the\r\nwestern fortress would have quickly enlightened him; for there stood\r\nDick Varley, and his mild-looking mother, and his loving dog, Crusoe.\r\nThere, too, stood Joe Blunt, like a bronzed warrior returned from the\r\nfight, turning from one to another as question poured in upon question\r\nalmost too rapidly to permit of a reply.  There, too, stood Henri,\r\nmaking enthusiastic speeches to whoever chose to listen to him,--now\r\nglaring at the crowd, with clenched fists and growling voice, as he told\r\nof how Joe and he had been tied hand and foot, and lashed to poles and\r\nburied in leaves, and threatened with a slow death by torture,--at other\r\ntimes bursting into a hilarious laugh as he held forth on the\r\npredicament of Mahtawa when that wily chief was treed by Crusoe in the\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nYoung Marston was there too, hanging about Dick, whom he loved as a\r\nbrother and regarded as a perfect hero.  Grumps, too, was there, and\r\nFan.  Do you think, reader, that Grumps looked at any one but Crusoe?\r\nIf you do you are mistaken.  Grumps on that day became a regular, an\r\nincorrigible, utter, and perfect nuisance to everybody--not excepting\r\nhimself, poor beast!  Grumps was a dog of one idea, and that idea was\r\nCrusoe.  Out of that great idea there grew one little secondary idea,\r\nand that idea was, that the only joy on earth worth mentioning was to\r\nsit on his haunches, exactly six inches from Crusoe's nose, and gaze\r\nsteadfastly into his face.  Wherever Crusoe went Grumps went.  If Crusoe\r\nstopped Grumps was down before him in an instant.  If Crusoe bounded\r\naway, which, in the exuberance of his spirits, he often did, Grumps was\r\nafter him like a bundle of mad hair.  He was in everybody's way--in\r\nCrusoe's way, and being, so to speak, \"beside himself,\" was also in his\r\nown way.  If people trod upon him accidentally, which they often did,\r\nGrumps uttered a solitary heart-rending yell, proportioned in intensity\r\nto the excruciating nature of the torture he endured, then instantly\r\nresumed his position and his fascinated stare.  Crusoe generally held\r\nhis head up, and gazed over his little friend at what was going on\r\naround him, but if for a moment he permitted his eye to rest on the\r\ncountenance of Grumps, that creature's tail became suddenly imbued with\r\nan amount of wriggling vitality that seemed to threaten its separation\r\nfrom the body.\r\n\r\nIt was really quite interesting to watch this unblushing, and\r\ndisinterested, and utterly reckless display of affection on the part of\r\nGrumps, and the amiable way in which Crusoe put up with it--we say put\r\nup with it, advisedly, because it must have been a very great\r\ninconvenience to him, seeing that if he attempted to move, his satellite\r\nmoved in front of him, so that his only way of escaping, temporarily,\r\nwas by jumping over Grumps's head.\r\n\r\nGrumps was everywhere all day.  Nobody, almost, escaped trampling on\r\npart of him.  He tumbled over everything, into everything, and against\r\neverything.  He knocked himself, singed himself, and scalded himself,\r\nand in fact forgot himself altogether; and when, late that night, Crusoe\r\nwent with Dick into his mother's cottage, and the door was shut, Grumps\r\nstretched his ruffled, battered, ill-used, and dishevelled little body\r\ndown on the doorstep, thrust his nose against the opening below the\r\ndoor, and lay in humble contentment all night, for he knew that Crusoe\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nOf course such an occasion could not pass without a shooting match.\r\nRifles were brought out after the feast was over, just before the sun\r\nwent down into its bed on the western prairies, and \"the nail\" was soon\r\nsurrounded by bullets, tipped by Joe Blunt and Jim Scraggs, and, of\r\ncourse, driven home by Dick Varley, whose silver rifle had now become,\r\nin its owner's hand, a never-failing weapon.  Races, too, were started,\r\nand here again Dick stood pre-eminent, and when night spread her dark\r\nmantle over the scene, the two best fiddlers in the settlement were\r\nplaced on empty beer-casks, and some danced by the light of the monster\r\nfires, while others listened to Joe Blunt as he recounted their\r\nadventures on the prairies and among the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThere were sweethearts, and wives, and lovers at the feast, but we\r\nquestion whether any heart there was so full of love, and admiration,\r\nand gratitude as that of the Widow Varley as she watched her son Dick,\r\nthroughout that merry evening.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYears rolled by, and the Mustang Valley prospered.  Missionaries went\r\nthere, and a little church was built, and to the blessings of a fertile\r\nland were added the far greater blessings of Christian light and\r\nknowledge.  One sad blow fell on the Widow Varley's heart.  Her only\r\nbrother, Daniel Hood, was murdered by the Indians.  Deeply and long she\r\nmourned, and it required all Dick's efforts and those of the pastor of\r\nthe settlement to comfort her.  But from the first the widow's heart was\r\nsustained by the loving hand that dealt the blow, and when time blunted\r\nthe keen edge of her feelings, her face became as sweet and mild, though\r\nnot so lightsome, as before.\r\n\r\nJoe Blunt and Henri became leading men in the councils of the Mustang\r\nValley, but Dick Varley preferred the woods, although, as long as his\r\nmother lived, he hovered round her cottage--going off sometimes for a\r\nday, sometimes for a week, but never longer.  After her head was laid in\r\nthe dust, Dick took altogether to the woods with Crusoe and Charlie the\r\nwild horse as his only companions, and his mother's Bible in the breast\r\nof his hunting shirt.  And soon Dick, the bold hunter, and his dog\r\nCrusoe, became renowned in the frontier settlements from the banks of\r\nthe Yellow Stone River to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMany a grizzly bear did the famous \"silver rifle\" lay low, and many a\r\nwild exciting chase and adventure did Dick go through, but during his\r\noccasional visits to the Mustang Valley, he was wont to say to Joe Blunt\r\nand Henri--with whom he always sojourned--that \"nothin' he ever felt or\r\nsaw came up to his first grand dash over the Western Prairies into the\r\nheart of the Rocky Mountains.\"  And in saying this, with enthusiasm in\r\nhis eye and voice, Dick invariably appealed to, and received a ready\r\naffirmative glance from, his early companion, and his faithful loving\r\nfriend--the dog Crusoe.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Dog Crusoe and his Master, by R.M.
