Many whereof, and most belonging\r\nto the First Chapter, having now lain dormant near seven years; and yet\r\nmight perhaps have so continued, had not _your Lordships_ Eye at length\r\ncreated Light upon them. In doing which, you have given one, amongst\r\nthose many Tokens, of as well your readiness to promote learning and\r\nknowledge by the hands of others; as your high Abilities to do it by\r\nyour own. Both which are so manifest in _your Lordship_, that like the\r\nfirst Principles of _Mathematical Science_, they are not so much to be\r\nasserted, because known and granted by all.\r\n\r\nThe Consideration whereof, _my Lord_, may make me not only _just_ in\r\nowning of your Favours, but also most _Ambitious_ of your _Patronage_:\r\nwhich yet to bespeak, I must confess I cannot well. Not that I think what\r\nis good and valuable, is alwaies its own best Advocate; for I know that\r\nthe Censures of men are humorous and variable, and that one Age must\r\nhave leave to frown on those Books, which another will do nothing less\r\nthan kiss and embrace. But chiefly for this Reason, lest I should so much\r\nas seem desirous of _your Lordships_ Solliciting my Cause as to all I\r\nhave said: For as it is your Glory, that you like not so to shine, as to\r\nput out the least Star; so were it to your Dishonour to borrow your Name\r\nto illustrate the Spots, though of the most conspicuous.\r\n\r\n           _Your Lordships_ Most Obliged & Most Humble Servant\r\n\r\n                                                         _Nehemiah Grew_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of what antiquity the ~Anatomy~ of ~Animals~ is, and how great have been\r\nits Improvements of later years, is well known. That of ~Vegetables~\r\nis a subject which from all Ages to this day hath not only lain by\r\nuncultivated; but for ought I know, except some Observations of some of\r\nour own Countrey-men, hath not been so much as thought upon; whether\r\nfor that the World hath been more enamoured with the former, or pity to\r\nhumane frailty hath more obliged to it, or other Reasons, I need not\r\nenquire._\r\n\r\n_But considering that both came at first out of the same Hand, and are\r\ntherefore the Contrivances of the same Wisdom; I thence fully assured my\r\nself, that it could not be a vain Design, though possibly unsuccessful,\r\nto seek it in both._\r\n\r\n_In the prosecution hereof, how far I have gone, I neither judge my\r\nself, nor leave it to any one else to do it; because no man knows how\r\nfar we have yet to go, or are capable of going. Nor is there any thing\r\nwhich starves and stinteth the growth of knowledge more, than such\r\nDeterminations, whether we speak or conceit them only._\r\n\r\n_What we have performed thus far, lieth, for the most part, open to the\r\nuse and improvement of all men. Only in some places, and chiefly in the\r\nThird Chapter, we have taken in the help of Glasses; wherein, after\r\nwe had finished the whole Composure, some Observations made by that\r\nIngenious and Learned Person Mr. ~Hook~, a Worthy Member of the ~Royal\r\nSociety~, my much Honoured Friend, and by him communicated to me, were\r\nsuper-added: As likewise some others also ~Microscopical~, of my own,\r\nwhich his gave me the occasion of making._\r\n\r\n_Those that shall think fit to examine, as well as to peruse these\r\nObservations, we advertise them, ~First~, That they begin, and so proceed\r\ntill they end again, with the Seed: For they will hardly be able to avoid\r\nErrour and Misapprehension, if either partial or preposterous in their\r\nEnquiries. ~Next~, That they confine not their Enquiries to one time of\r\nthe Year; but to make them in several Seasons, wherein the Parts of a\r\n~Vegetable~ may be seen in their several Estates. ~And then~, That they\r\nneglect not the comparative ~Anatomy~; for as some things are better seen\r\nin one estate, so in one ~Vegetable~, than another._\r\n\r\n_What, upon Observation already made, we have erected, as they are not\r\nSticks and Straws; so neither do we assure all to be of the best Oak. How\r\nDogmatical soever my Assertions may seem to be, yet do I not affect the\r\nunreasonable Tyranny of obtruding upon the Faith of any. He that speaketh\r\nReason, may be rather satisfied, in being understood, than believed._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1.\r\n\r\n_Of the Seed as Vegetating._\r\n\r\nThe Method propounded. 1, 2.

I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Seed as Vegetating._\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing to speak of Vegetables; and, as far as Inspection and consequent\r\nReason may conduct, to enquire into the visible Constitutions and Uses of\r\ntheir several Parts; I chuse that Method which may with best advantage\r\nsuit to what we have to say hereon: And that is the Method of Nature her\r\nself, in her continued Series of Vegetations, proceeding from the Seed\r\nsown, to the formation of the Root, Trunk, Branch, Leaf, Flower, Fruit,\r\nand last of all, of the Seed also to be sown again; all which we shall in\r\nthe same order particularly speak of.\r\n\r\nThe Essential Constitutions of the said Parts are in all Vegetables the\r\nsame: But for Observation, some are more convenient; in which I shall\r\nchiefly instance. And first of all, for the Seed we chuse the great\r\nGarden-Bean.\r\n\r\nIf we take a Bean then and dissect it, we shall find it cloathed with\r\na double Vest or Coat: These Coats, while the Bean is yet green, are\r\nseparable, and easily distinguished. When ’tis dry, they cleave so\r\nclosely together, that the Eye, not before instructed, will judge them\r\nbut one; the inner Coat likewise (which is of the most rare contexture)\r\nso far shrinking up, as to seem only the roughness of the outer, somewhat\r\nresembling Wafers under _Maquaroons_.\r\n\r\nAt the thicker end of the Bean, in the outer Coat, a very small _Foramen_\r\npresents it self: In dissection ’tis found to terminate against the point\r\nof that part which I call the _Radicle_, whereof I shall presently speak.\r\nIt is of that capacity as to admit a small Virginal Wyer, and is most\r\nconspicuous in a green Bean.\r\n\r\nThis _Foramen_ may be observed not only in the great Garden-Bean, but\r\nlikewise in the other kinds; in the French-Bean very plainly; in Pease,\r\nLupines, Vetches, Lentiles, and other Pulse ’tis also found; and in many\r\nSeeds not reckoned of this kindred, as in that of _Fœnugreek_, _Medica\r\nTornata_, _Goats-Rue_, and others: In many of which, ’tis so very small,\r\nas scarcely, without the help of Glasses to be discovered; and in some,\r\nnot without cutting off part of the Seed besides, which otherwise would\r\nintercept the sight hereof; it being in these and such like Seeds, from\r\nthe place of the breaking off of the Peduncle perfectly distinct.\r\n\r\nWe may then observe, that all Seeds which have thick or hard Coats,\r\nhave the same likewise perforated, in this, or some other manner. And\r\naccordingly, although the Coats of such Seeds as are lodg’d in Shells or\r\nStones, being thin, are not visibly perforated; yet the Stones and Shells\r\nthemselves always are; as _Chap. 7._ shall be seen how. To which Chapter,\r\nwhat is farther observable, either as to the nature, or number of the\r\ncovers of the Seed, I also refer.\r\n\r\nThe Coats of the Bean being stripp’d off the proper Seed shews it self.\r\nThe parts whereof it is constituted, are three; _sc._ the main Body, and\r\ntwo other appendant to it, which we may call the three Organical parts of\r\nthe Bean.\r\n\r\nThe main Body is not one entire piece, but alwaies divided lengthwise\r\ninto two halves or Lobes, which are both joyn’d together at the Basis\r\nof the Bean. These Lobes in dry Beans, are but difficultly separated or\r\nobserv’d; but in young ones, especially boil’d, they easily slip asunder.\r\nSee _Fig. 1_.\r\n\r\nSome very few Seeds are divided, not into two Lobes, but more; as that of\r\n_Cresses_; and some not at all divided, but entire; as _Corn_: Excepting\r\nwhich few, all other Seeds, even the smallest are divided, like as the\r\nBean, into just two Lobes: whereof though in most Seeds we cannot by\r\ndissection be inform’d; yet otherwise we easily may as shall be seen.\r\n\r\nAt the Basis of the Bean, the two other Organical parts stand appendent;\r\nby mediation whereof the two Lobes meet and join together. The greater\r\nof these two parts stands without the two Lobes, and upon divesting the\r\nBean of its Coats, is immediately visible. ’Tis of a whiter colour, and\r\nmore glossie than the main Body, especially when the Bean is young. In\r\nthe Bean, and many other Seeds, tis situated somewhat above the thicker\r\nend, as you hold the Bean in its most proper posture for growth. In\r\nOak-Kernels, which we call Acorns, Apple-Kernels, Almonds, and many other\r\nSeeds, it stands prominent just from the end; the Basis and the end\r\nbeing in these the same, but in the Bean divers. See _Fig. 1_.\r\n\r\nThis part is not only in the Bean, and the Seeds above mentioned; but in\r\nall others: being that which upon the Vegetation of the Seed, becomes\r\nthe Root of the Plant; which therefore I call the _Radicle_: by which, I\r\nmean the Materials, abating the Formality, of a Root, ’Tis not easie to\r\nbe observed, saving in some few Seeds, amongst which, that of the Bean is\r\nthe most fair and ample of all I have seen; but that of some other Seeds,\r\nis, in proportion, greater; as of _Fœnugreek_, which is almost as big as\r\none of its Lobes.\r\n\r\nThe lesser of the two laid Appendents lies occult between the two Lobes\r\nof the Bean, by separation whereof only it is to be seen. ’Tis enclos’d\r\nin two small Cavities form’d in the Lobes for its reception. Its colour\r\ncomes near that of the _Radicle_; and is founded upon the Basis thereof\r\nhaving a quite contrary production, _sc._ towards the cone of the Bean;\r\nand being that very part, which, in process, becomes the Body or Trunk of\r\nthe Vegetable. See _Fig. 1_.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this Part principally it is, that the Bean is divided\r\ninto Lobes; _sc._ that it may be warmly and safely lodged up between\r\nthem; and so secur’d from the Injuries so tender a Part would sustain\r\nfrom the Mould, whereto, had the Main Body been entire, it must upon the\r\nSprouting of the _Bean_ have lain contiguous.\r\n\r\nThis Part is not, like the _Radicle_, an entire Body, but divided at its\r\nloose end into divers pieces, all very close set together, as Feathers\r\nin a Bunch; for which reason it may be called the _Plume_. They are so\r\nclose, that only two or three of the outmost are at first seen: but upon\r\na nice and curious separation of these, the more interiour still may be\r\ndiscovered. Now as the _Plume_ is that Part which becomes the Trunk of\r\nthe Plant, so these pieces are so many true, and already formed, though\r\nnot displayed, Leaves, intended for the said Trunk, and foulded up in the\r\nsame plicature, wherein, upon the sprouting of the Bean, they afterwards\r\nappear. In a French Bean the two outmost are very fair and elegant. In\r\nthe great Garden-Bean, two extraordinary small Plumes, often, if not\r\nalways, stand one on either side the great one now describ’d: From which,\r\nin that they differ in nothing save in their size, I therefore only here\r\njust take notice of them. And these three Parts, _sc._ the _Main Body_,\r\nthe _Radicle_, and the _Plume_, are concurrent to the making up of every\r\nSeed; and no more than these.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a view of the Organical Parts of the Bean, let\r\nus next examine the Similary, _sc._ those whereof the Organical are\r\ncompos’d: a distinct observation of which, for a clear understanding of\r\nthe Vegetation of the Seed, and of the whole Plant arising thence, is\r\nrequisite: To obtain which, we must proceed in our Anatomy.\r\n\r\nDissecting a Bean then, the first Part occurring is its Cuticle. The\r\nEye and first Thoughts suggest it to be only a more dense and glossy\r\nSuperficies; but better enquiry discovers it a real Cuticle. ’Tis so\r\nexquisitely thin, and for the most part so firmly continuous with the\r\nBody of the Bean, that it cannot, except in some small Rag, be distinctly\r\nseen; which, by carrying your Knife superficially into the Bean, and then\r\nvery gently bearing upward what you have cut, will separate and shew it\r\nself transparent. This Cuticle is not only spread upon the Convex of the\r\nLobes, but also on their Flats, where they are contiguous, extending it\r\nself likewise upon both the _Radicle_ and _Plume_, and so over the whole\r\nBean.\r\n\r\nThis Part, though it be so far common with the Coats of the Bean, as to\r\nbe like those, an Integument; yet are we in a quite different Notion to\r\nconceive of it: For whereas the Coats upon setting the Bean, do only\r\nadminister the Sap, and, as being superseded from their Office, then die;\r\nas shall be seen: this, on the contrary, with the Organical Parts of the\r\nBean, is nourished, augmented, and by a real Vegetation co-extended.\r\n\r\nNext to the Cuticle, we come to the _Parenchyma_ it self; the Part\r\nthroughout which the _inner Body_, whereof we shall speak anon, is\r\ndisseminated; for which reason I call it the _Parenchyma_. The Surface\r\nhereof is somewhat dense, but inwardly ’tis more porous, and of a laxer\r\nContexture. If you view it in a Microscope, it hath some similitude to\r\nthe Pith, while sappy, in the Roots and Trunks of Plants; and that for\r\ngood reason, as in _Ch. 2._ shall be seen. This is best seen in green\r\nBeans. See _Fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nThis Part would seem by its colour to be peculiar to the Lobes of\r\nthe Bean; but as is the Cuticle, so is this also, common both to the\r\n_Radicle_ and _Plume_; that is, the _Parenchyma_ of the Bean, as to\r\nits essential substance, is the same in all three. The reason why the\r\ncolour of the _Plume_, and especially of the _Radicle_, which is white,\r\nis so different from that of the Lobes, may chiefly depend upon their\r\nbeing more compact and dense, and thence their different Tinctures. And\r\ntherefore the Lobes themselves, which are green while the Bean is young;\r\nyet being old and dry, become whitish too. And in many other Seeds, as\r\nAcorns, Almonds, the Kernels of Apples, Plums, Nuts, _&c._ the Lobes,\r\neven fresh and young, are pure white as the Radicle it self.\r\n\r\nBut although the _Parenchyma_ be common, as is said, to all the Organical\r\nParts; yet in very differing proportions. In the _Plume_, where it is\r\nproportionably least, it maketh about three Fifths of the whole _Plume_;\r\nin the _Radicle_, it maketh about five Seavenths of the whole _Radicle_;\r\nand in each Lobe, is so far over-proportionate, as to make at least nine\r\nTenths of the whole Lobe.\r\n\r\nBy what hath been said, that the _Parenchyma_ is not the only\r\nconstituting Part, besides the Cuticle, is imply’d: there being another\r\nBody, of an essentially different substance, embosom’d herein: which may\r\nbe found, not only in the _Radicle_ and _Plume_, but also in the Lobes\r\nthemselves, and so in the whole Bean. See _Fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nThis inner Body appears most plain and conspicuous in cutting the\r\n_Radicle_ athwart, and so proceeding by degrees towards the _Plume_,\r\nthrough both which it runneth in a large and straight Trunk. In the\r\nLobes, being it is there in so very small proportion, ’tis difficultly\r\nseen, especially towards their Verges: yet if with a sharp Knife you\r\nsmoothly cut the Lobes of the Bean athwart, divers small Specks, of a\r\ndifferent colour from that of the _Parenchyma_, standing therein all\r\nalong in a Line, may be observ’d; which Specks are the Terminations of\r\nthe Branches of this inner Body. See _Fig. 3_.\r\n\r\nFor this inner Body, as it is existent in every Organical part of the\r\nBean, so is it, with respect to each part, most regularly distributed.\r\nIn a good part of the _Radicle_ ’tis one entire Trunk; towards the\r\nBasis thereof, ’tis divided into three main Branches; the middlemost\r\nrunneth directly into the Plume; the other two on either side it, after\r\na little space, pass into the Lobes; where the said Branches dividing\r\nthemselves into other smaller; and those into more, and smaller again,\r\nare terminated towards the Verges of each Lobe; in which manner the said\r\ninner Body being distributed, it becomes in each Lobe, a true and perfect\r\nRoot. See _Fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nThis Seminal Root, as now we’ll call it, being so tender, cannot be\r\nperfectly excarnated, as may the Vessels in the Parts of an Animal, by\r\nthe most accurate Hand; yet by dissection begun and continu’d, as is\r\nabove-declared, its whole frame and distribution may be easily observ’d.\r\nAgain, if you take the Lobe of a Bean, and lengthwise pare off its\r\n_Parenchyma_ by degrees, and in very thin Shives, many Branches of the\r\nSeminal Root, (which by the other way of Dissection were only noted by so\r\nmany Specks) both as they are fewer about the Basis of the Bean, and more\r\nnumerous towards its Verges, in some good distinction and entireness will\r\nappear. For this you must have new Beans.\r\n\r\nAs the inner Body is branched out in the Lobes, so is it in the _Plume_:\r\nFor if you cut the _Plume_ athwart, and from the Basis proceed along\r\nthe Body thereof, you’l find therein, first, one large Trunk or Branch,\r\nand after four or five very small Specks round about it, which are the\r\nterminations of so many lesser Branches therewith distributed to the\r\nseveral parts of the _Plume_. See _Fig. 4_. The distribution of the\r\ninner Body, as it is continuous throughout all the Organical Parts of the\r\nBean, is represented by _Fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nThis _Inner Body_ is, by dissection, best observable in the Bean and\r\ngreat Lupine. In other larger Pulse it shows likewise some obscure Marks\r\nof it-self: But in no other Seeds, which I have observed, though of the\r\ngreatest size, as of _Apples_, _Plums_, _Nuts_, &c. is there any clear\r\nappearance hereof, upon dissection, saving in the _Radicle_ and _Plume_;\r\nthe reason of which is partly from its quantity, being in most Seeds so\r\nextraordinary little; partly from its Colour, which in most Seeds, is the\r\nsame with that of the _Parenchyma_ it self, and so not distinguishable\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nYet in a _Gourd-Seed_, the whole _Seminal Root_, not only its _Main\r\nBranches_, but also the Sub-divisions and Inosculations of the lesser\r\nones, are without any dissection, upon the separation of the Lobes,\r\non their contiguous Flats immediatly apparent. See _Fig. 5_. And as to\r\nthe existence of this Seminal Root, what Dissection cannot attain,\r\nocular inspection in hundreds of other Seeds, even the smallest, will\r\ndemonstrate; as in this _Chapter_ shall be seen how.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, let us only take notice, that when we say every Plant\r\nhath its Root, we reckon short, for every Plant hath really two, though\r\nnot contemporary, yet successive Roots, its Original or _Seminal-Root_\r\nwithin its Seed, and its _Plant-Root_, which the _Radicle_ becometh in\r\nits growth: the _Parenchyma_ of the Seed being in some resemblance, that\r\nto the _Seminal Root_ at first, which the Mould is to the _Plant-Root_\r\nafterwards; and the _Seminal Root_ being that to the _Plant-Root_, which\r\nthe _Plant-Root_ is to the _Trunk_. For our better understanding whereof,\r\nhaving taken a view of the several Parts of a Bean, as far as Dissection\r\nconducts; we will next briefly enquire into the use of the said Parts,\r\nand in what manner they are the Fountain of Vegetation, and concurrent to\r\nthe being of the future Plant.\r\n\r\nThe general Cause of the growth of a _Bean_ or other Seed, is\r\n_Fermentation_; that is, the _Bean_ lying in the Mould, and a moderate\r\naccess of some moisture, partly dissimilar, and partly congenerous,\r\nbeing made, a gentle _Fermentation_ thence ariseth; by which the _Bean_\r\nswelling, and the _Sap_ still encreasing, and the _Bean_ continuing still\r\nto swell, the work thus proceeds: as is the usual way of explicating. But\r\nthat there is simply a _Fermentation_, and so a sufficient supply of\r\n_Sap_, is not enough; but that this _Fermentation_ and the _Sap_ wherein\r\n’tis made, should be under a various Government by divers Parts thereto\r\nsubservient, is also requisite; and as the various preparation of the\r\n_Aliment_ in an _Animal_, equally necessary, the particular process of\r\nthe Work according whereto, we find none undertaking to declare.\r\n\r\nLet us look upon a _Bean_ then, as a piece of Work so fram’d and set\r\ntogether, as to declare a Design for the production of a Plant, which,\r\nupon its lying in some convenient Soyl, is thus effected. First of all,\r\nthe _Bean_ being enfoulded round in its Coats, the _Sap_ wherewith it is\r\nfed, must of necessity pass through these: By which means, it is not only\r\nin a proportionate quantity, and by due degrees; but also in a purer\r\nbody; and possibly not without some Vegetable Tincture, transmitted to\r\nthe _Bean_. Whereas, were the _Bean_ naked, the _Sap_ must needs be, as\r\nover-copious, so but crude and immature, as not being filtred through so\r\nfine a Cotton as the Coats be. And as they have the use of a _Filtre_\r\nto the transient _Sap_, so of a Vessel to that which is still deposited\r\nwithin them; being alike accommodated to the securer _Fermentation_\r\nhereof, as Bottles or Barrels are to Beer, or any other _Fermentative\r\nLiquor_.\r\n\r\nAnd as the _Fermentation_ is promoted by some Aperture in the Vessel; so\r\nhave we the _Foramen_ in the upper Coat also contrived, that if there\r\nshould be need of some more aiery Particles to excite the _Fermentation_,\r\nthrough this they may obtain their Entry: Or, on the contrary, should\r\nthere be any such Particles or Steams as might damp the genuine\r\nproceeding thereof, through this again they may have easy issue: being\r\nthat, as a common Pasport here to the _Sap_, which what we call the\r\nBung-hole of the Barrel, is to the new-tunn’d Liquor. That this _Foramen_\r\nis truly permeable even in old setting _Beans_, appears upon their being\r\nsoak’d for some time in Water: For then taking them out, and crushing\r\nthem a little, many small bubbles will alternately arise and break upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe _Sap_ being passed through the Coats, it next enters the Body of the\r\n_Bean_; yet not indiscriminately neither; but, being filtred through the\r\n_Outer Coat_, and fermented both in the Body and Concave of the _Inner_,\r\nis by mediation of the _Cuticle_, again more finely filtr’d, and so\r\nentereth the _Parenchyma_ it self under a fourth Government.\r\n\r\nThrough which Part the _Sap_ passing towards the _Seminal Root_, as\r\nthrough that which is of a more spacious content; besides the benefit it\r\nhath of a farther percolation, it will also find room enough for a more\r\nfree and active fermenting and maturation herein. And being moreover,\r\npart of the true Body of the _Bean_, and so with its proper Seminalities\r\nor Tinctures copiously repleat; the _Sap_ will not only find room, but\r\nalso matter enough, by whose Energy its _Fermentation_ will still be more\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Sap_ being duly prepared here, it next passeth into all the\r\nBranches of the _Seminal Root_, and so under a fifth Government. Wherein\r\nhow delicate ’tis now become, we may conceive by the proportion betwixt\r\nthe _Parenchyma_ and this _Seminal Root_; so much only of the best\r\ndigested _Sap_ being discharged from the whole Stock in that, as this\r\nwill receive. And this, moreover, as the _Parenchyma_, with its proper\r\nSeminalities being endowed; the _Sap_, for the supply of the _Radicle_,\r\nand of the young Root from thence, is duly prepared therein, and with its\r\nhighest Tincture and Impregnation at last enriched.\r\n\r\nThe _Sap_ being thus prepared in the Lobes of the _Bean_, ’tis thence\r\ndischarg’d; and either into the _Plume_ or the _Radicle_, must forthwith\r\nissue. And since the _Plume_ is a dependent on the _Radicle_; the _Sap_\r\ntherefore ought first to be dispenced to this; which accordingly is ever\r\nfound to shoot forth before the _Plume_, and that sometimes an inch or\r\ntwo in length. Now because the primitive course of the _Sap_ into the\r\n_Radicle_, is thus requisite, therefore by the frame of the Parts of\r\nthe _Bean_ is it made necessary too. For we may observe that the two\r\nmain Branches of the _Seminal Root_ in which the several _Ramifications_\r\nin either Lobe are all united, commit not themselves into the _Seminal\r\nTrunk_ of the _Plume_, nor yet so as to stand at right Angles with them,\r\nand with equal respect towards them both; but being producted through\r\npart of the _Parenchyma_ of the _Radicle_, are at last united therein to\r\nthe main Trunk, and make acute Angles therewith; as may be seen by _Fig.\r\n2_. Now the _Sap_ being brought as far as the _Seminal Root_ in either\r\nLobe, and according to the conduct thereof continuing still to move,\r\nit must needs immediately issue into the same part whereinto the main\r\nBranches themselves do, that is, into the _Radicle_. By which _Sap_,\r\nthus bringing the several Tinctures of the parts aforesaid with it, being\r\nnow fed; it is no longer a meer _Radicle_, but is made also _Seminal_,\r\nand so becomes a perfect Root.\r\n\r\nThe _Radicle_ being thus impregnate and shot into a root, ’tis now time\r\nfor the _Plume_ to rouze out of its Cloysters, and germinate too: In\r\norder whereto, ’tis now fed from the Root with laudable and sufficient\r\nAliment. For as the Supplies and motion of the _Sap_ were first made\r\nfrom the Lobes towards the Root, so the Root being well shot into the\r\nMoulds, and now receiving a new and more copious _Sap_ from these; the\r\nmotion hereof must needs be stronger, and by degrees revert the primitive\r\n_Sap_, and so move in a contrary course, _sc._ from the Root towards the\r\n_Plume_; and, by the continuation of the _Seminal trunk_, is directly\r\nconducted thereinto; by which, being fed, it gradually enlarges and\r\ndisplayes it self.\r\n\r\nThe course of the _Sap_ thus turned, it issues, I say, in a direct Line\r\nfrom the _Root_ into the _Plume_, but collaterally into the Lobes also;\r\n_sc._ by those two aforesaid Branches which are obliquely transmitted\r\nfrom the _Radicle_ into either Lobe. By which Branches the said _Sap_\r\nbeing disbursed back into all the _Seminal Root_, and from thence\r\nlikewise into the _Parenchyma_ of the Lobes; they are both thus fed, and\r\nfor some time augmenting themselves, really grow; as in _Lupines_ is\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nYet is not this common to all Seeds; some rot under-ground, as _Corn_;\r\nbeing of a laxer and less Oleous substance, differing herein from most\r\nother Seeds; and being not divided into Lobes, but one entire thick\r\nBody. And some, although they continue firm, yet rise not as the great\r\n_Garden-Bean_; in which therefore it is observable, that the two Main\r\nBranches of the Lobes in comparison with that which runs into the\r\n_Plume_, are but mean; and so insufficient to the feeding and vegetation\r\nof the Lobes; the _Plume_, on the contrary, growing so lusty, as to mount\r\nup without them.\r\n\r\nExcepting a few of these two kinds, all other Seeds whatsoever, (which I\r\nhave observed) besides that they continue firm, upon the Vegetation of\r\nthe _Plume_, mount also upwards, and advance above the Mould together\r\nwith it; as all Seeds which spring up with dissimilar Leaves, the two\r\n(for the most part two) dissimilar Leaves, being the very Lobes of the\r\nSeed divided, expanded, and thus advanced.\r\n\r\nThe Impediments of our apprehension hereof are the Colour, Size and\r\nShape of the dissimilar Leaves. Notwithstanding, that they are nothing\r\nelse but the main body of the Seed, how I came first to phansie, and\r\nafterwards to know it, was thus: First, I observed in general that the\r\ndissimilar Leaves were never jagg’d, but even edg’d: And seeing the even\r\nverges of the Lobes of the Seed hereto respondent, I was apt to think,\r\nthat those which were so like, might prove the same. Next descending\r\nto particular Seeds, I observed first of the _Lupine_; that as to its\r\nColour, upon its advance above the Mould, it ever changed into a perfect\r\nGreen. And why might not the same by parity of Reason be inferr’d of\r\nother Seeds? That, as to its size, it grew but little bigger than when\r\nfirst set. Whence, as I discern’d (the Augmentation being but little)\r\nwe here had only the two Lobes: So, (as some augmentation there was) I\r\ninferr’d the like might be, and that, in farther degrees, in other Seeds.\r\n\r\nNext, of the _Cucumber_-seed. That, as to its Colour, often appearing\r\nabove ground in its Primitive white, from white it turns to yellow,\r\nand from yellow to green, the proper colour of a Leaf: That, as to its\r\nsize, though at its first arise, the Lobes were little bigger than upon\r\nsetting; yet afterwards as they chang’d their Colour, so their Dimensions\r\nalso, growing to a three-four-five-fold amplitude above their primitive\r\nsize: But whereas the Lobes of the Seed are in proportion, narrow, short\r\nand thick, how then come the dissimilar Leaves to be so exceeding broad,\r\nor long and thin? The Question answers it self: For the dissimilar\r\nLeaves, for very reason are so thin, because so very broad or long; as\r\nwe see many things, how much they are extended in length or breadth, so\r\nmuch they lose in depth, or grow more thin; which is that which here\r\nbefalls the now effoliated Lobes. For being once disimprisoned from their\r\nCoats, and the course of the Sap into them now more and more encreased,\r\nthey must needs very considerably amplifie themselves; and from the\r\nmanner wherein the _Seminal Root_ is branched in them, that amplification\r\ncannot be in thickness, but in length or breadth: In both which, in some\r\ndissimilar Leaves ’tis very remarkable; especially in length, as in those\r\nof _Lettice_, _Thorn-Apple_, and others; whose Seeds, although very\r\nsmall, yet the Lobes of those Seeds growing up into Dissimilar Leaves,\r\nare extended an Inch, and sometimes more, in length; though he that\r\nshall attempt to get a clear sight of the Lobes of _Thorn-Apple_, and\r\nsome others, by Dissection, will find it no easy Task; yet is that which\r\nmay be obtained. From all which, and the observation of other Seeds, I\r\nat last found, that the dissimilar Leaves of a young Plant, are nothing\r\nelse but the Lobes or _main Body_ of its Seed: So that as the Lobes did\r\nat first feed and impregnate the _Radicle_ into a _perfect Root_; so the\r\n_Root_ being perfected, doth again feed, and by degrees amplifie each\r\nLobe into a perfect Leaf.\r\n\r\nThe Original of the dissimilar Leaves thus known, we understand, why some\r\nPlants have none; because the Seed either riseth not, as _Garden-Beans_,\r\n_Corn_, &c. Or upon rising, the Lobes are little alter’d, as _Lupines_,\r\n_Pease_, &c. Why, though the proper Leaves are often indented round; the\r\ndissimilar, like the Lobes, are even-edg’d. Why, though the proper Leaves\r\nare often hairy, yet these are ever smooth. Why some have more dissimilar\r\nLeaves than two, as _Cresses_, which have six, as the Ingenious Mr.\r\n_Sharrock_ also observes; the reason whereof is, because the _Main\r\nBody_ is not divided into two, but six, distinct Lobes, as I have often\r\ncounted. Why _Radishes_ seem at first to have four, which yet after\r\nappear plainly two; because the Lobes of the Seed have both a little\r\nIndenture, and are both plaited, one over the other. To which we might\r\nadd,\r\n\r\nThe use of the dissimilar Leaves is, first, for the protection of the\r\n_Plume_; which being but young, and so but soft and tender, is provided\r\nwith these, as a double Guard, one on either side of it. For this\r\nreason it is, that the _Plume_ in Corn is trussed up within a membranous\r\nSheath; and that of a _Bean_, cooped up betwixt a pair of _Surfoyls_; but\r\nwhere the Lobes rise, there the _Plume_ hath neither of them, being both\r\nneedless.\r\n\r\nAgain, that since the _Plume_, being yet tender, may be injured not\r\nonly by the Air, but also for want of Sap, the supplies from the Root\r\nbeing yet but slow and sparing; that the said _Plume_ therefore, by the\r\ndissimilar Leaves, may have the advantage likewise of some refreshment\r\nfrom Dew or Rain. For these having their Basis a little beneath that of\r\nthe _Plume_, and expanding themselves on all sides of it, they often\r\nstand after Rain, like a Vessel of Water, continually soaking and\r\nsupplying it, lest its new access into the Ayr, should shrivel it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, that since the dissimilar Leaves by their Basis intercept the\r\n_Root_ and _Plume_, the greater and grosser part of the Sap may be by\r\nthe way deposited into those; and so the purest proceed into the yet but\r\nyoung and delicate _Plume_, as its fittest Aliment.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have here a demonstration of the being of the _Seminal Root_;\r\nwhich since through the colour or smallness of the Seed, it could not by\r\ndissection be observ’d, except in some few; Nature hath here provided us\r\na way of viewing it in the now effoliated Lobes, not of one or two Seeds,\r\nbut of hundreds; the _Seminal Root_ visibly branching it self towards the\r\nCone and Verges of the said Lobes, or now dissimilar Leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Root._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving examin’d and pursu’d the Degrees of _Vegetation_ in the _Seed_,\r\nwe find its two Lobes have here their utmost period; and, that having\r\nconveyed their Seminalities into the _Radicle_ and into the _Plume_;\r\nthese therefore as the Root and Trunk of the Plant still survive; Of\r\nthese in their order we next proceed to speak; and first, of the _Root_:\r\nwhereof, as well as of the _Seed_, we must by Dissection inform our\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nIn Dissection of a _Root_ then, we shall find it with the _Radicle_, as\r\nthe Parts of an old man with those of a _Fœtus_, substantially one. The\r\nfirst Part occurring is its skin, the Original whereof is from the Seed:\r\nFor that extream thin Cuticle which is spred over the Lobes of the Seed,\r\nand from thence over the _Radicle_, upon the shooting of the _Radicle_\r\ninto a Root, is co-extended, and becomes its Skin.\r\n\r\nThe next Part is the _Cortical Body_; the Original whereof likewise is\r\nfrom the Seed; or the _Parenchyma_, which is there common both to the\r\nLobes and _Radicle_, being by Vegetation augmented and prolonged into the\r\n_Root_, is here the _Cortical Body_, or that which is sometimes called\r\nthe _Barque_.\r\n\r\nThe Contexture of this _Cortical Body_ may be well illustrated by\r\nthat of a _Sponge_, being a Body Porous, Dilative, and Pliable. Its\r\nPores, as they are innumerable, so extream small. These Pores are not\r\nonly susceptive of so much Moisture as to fill, but also to enlarge\r\nthemselves, and so to dilate the _Cortical Body_ wherein they are; which\r\nby the shriv’ling in thereof, by being expos’d to the Air, is also seen.\r\nIn which dilatation many of its Parts becoming more lax and distant, and\r\nnone of them suffering a solution of their continuity; ’tis a Body also\r\nsufficiently pliable; or, a most exquisitely fine-wrought Sponge.\r\n\r\nThe Extention of these Pores is much alike both by their length and\r\nbreadth of the Root; which from the shrinking up of the _Cortical Body_,\r\nin a piece of a cut Root, by the same dimensions, is argu’d.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of this _Cortical Body_ are various: If thin, ’tis\r\ncalled a _Barque_; & thought to serve to no other end, than what is\r\nusually ascrib’d to it as a _Barque_; which is a narrow conceit: If a\r\nBulky Body in comparison with that within it, as in the young Roots of\r\n_Cychory_, _Asparagus_, &c. ’tis here, because the fairest, therefore\r\ntaken for the prime Part; which, though, as to Medicinal use, it is;\r\nyet, as to the private use of the Plant, not so. The Colour hereof,\r\nthough it be originally white, yet in the continued growth of the Root,\r\ndivers Tinctures, as yellow in _Dock_, red in _Bistort_, are thereinto\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nNext within this Part stands the _Lignous Body_; the Original whereof,\r\nas of the two former, is from the Seed; or, the _Seminal Roots_ of both\r\nthe Lobes, being united in the _Radicle_, and with its _Parenchyma_\r\nco-extended, is here in the Root the _Lignous Body_.\r\n\r\nThe Contexture hereof is, in many of its parts, much more close than that\r\nof the _Cortical_; and their Pores very different: For whereas those of\r\nthe _Cortical_ are infinitely numerous, these of the _Lignous_ are in\r\ncomparison, nothing so. But these, although fewer, yet are they many of\r\nthem more open, fair, and visible: as in a very thin Slice cut athwart\r\nthe young Root of a Tree, and held up against the Light, is apparent: Yet\r\nnot in all equally, in _Coran_-Tree, in _Goosberry_-Tree, _&c._ less; in\r\n_Oak_, _Plums_, and especially _Damascens_, more; in _Elder_, _Vines_,\r\n&c. more conspicuous. And as they are different in number and size,\r\nso also (whereon the numerousness of the Pores of the _Cortical Body_\r\nprincipally depends) in their shape. For whereas those of the _Cortical\r\nBody_ are extended much alike both by the length and breadth of the\r\n_Root_; these of the _Lignous_ are only by the length; which, especially\r\nin _Vines_ and some other _Roots_, is evident. Of these Pores, ’tis also\r\nobservable, that although in all places of the _Root_ they are visible,\r\nyet most fair and open about the _Fibrous Extremities_ of some _Roots_\r\n(and in many _Roots_ higher) where there is no Pith. These Pores, as they\r\nshew in young _Roots_ of Trees, see in _Fig. 6_, & _7_.\r\n\r\nThis _Lignous Body_ lieth with all its Parts, so far as they are visible,\r\nin a Circle or Ring; yet are there divers extream small Fibres thence\r\nshooting, usually mixed with the _Cortical Body_; and by the somewhat\r\ndifferent colour of the said _Cortical Body_ where they stand, may be\r\nnoted these Fibres; the _Cortical Body_ and _Skin_ all together, properly\r\nmake the _Barque_.\r\n\r\nThe proportion betwixt this _Lignous Body_ and the _Cortical_, is\r\nvarious, as was said; yet in this, constant, _sc._ that in the fibrous,\r\nand smaller Parts of the _Root_, the _Lignous Body_ is not only in\r\ncompass, but in quantity the less; running like a slender Wyer or Nerve\r\nthrough the other surrounding it. They stand both together pyramidally,\r\nwhich is most common to _Infant-Roots_, but also to many other.\r\n\r\nThe next Part observable in the _Root_, is the _Insertment_. The\r\nexistence hereof, so far as we can yet observe, is sometimes in\r\nthe _Radicle_ of the Seed it self; I cannot say alwayes. As to its\r\nsubstantial nature, we are more certain; that it is the same with that\r\nof the _Parenchyma_ of the _Radicle_; being alwayes at least augmented,\r\nand so, in part, originated from the _Cortical Body_, and so, at second\r\nhand, from the said _Parenchyma_: For in dissecting a _Root_, we find,\r\nthat the _Cortical Body_ doth not only environ the _Lignous_, but is also\r\nwedg’d, and in many pieces inserted into it; and that the said inserted\r\npieces, make not a meer Indenture, but transmit and shoot themselves\r\nquite through as far as the Pith; which in a thin Slice cut athwart the\r\n_Root_ as so many lines drawn from the Circumference towards the Center,\r\nshew themselves. See _Fig. 6_, & _7_.\r\n\r\nThe Pores of the _Insertment_ are sometimes, at least, extended somewhat\r\nmore by the breadth of the _Root_, as about the top of the _Root_ of\r\n_Borage_ may be seen; and are thus different from those of the _Cortical\r\nBody_, which are extended by the length and breadth much alike; and from\r\nthose of the _Lignous_, being only by its length.\r\n\r\nThe number and size of these Insertions are various. In _Hawthorn_, and\r\nsome others, and especially _Willows_, they are most extream small; in\r\n_Cherries_ and _Plums_ they are large; and in _Damascens_ especially,\r\nvery fairly apparent. In the _Roots_ of small _Plants_ they are generally\r\nmore easily discoverable; which may lead to the observation of them in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThese Insertions, although they are continuous through both the length\r\nand breadth of the _Root_; yet not so in all Parts, but by the several\r\nshootings of the _Lignous Body_ are frequently intercepted. For of the\r\n_Lignous Body_ it is (here best) observable, That its several shootings,\r\nbetwixt which the _Cortical_ is inserted, are not throughout the _Root_\r\nwholly distinct; but that all along being enarch’d, the _Lignous Body_,\r\nboth in length and breadth, is thus disposed into Braces or Osculations.\r\nBetwixt these several shootings of the _Lignous Body_ thus osculated,\r\nthe _Cortical_ shooting, and being also osculated answerably Brace for\r\nBrace, that which I call the _Insertment_ is fram’d thereof.\r\n\r\nThese Osculations are so made, that the Pores of the _Lignous Body_, I\r\nthink, notwithstanding, seldom run one into another; but, for the most\r\npart, still keep distinct; in the same manner as some of the Nerves,\r\nthough they meet, and for some space are associated together, yet ’tis\r\nmost probable that none of their Fibres are truly inosculated here, but\r\nonly in the Plexures.\r\n\r\nThese Osculations of the _Lignous Body_, and so the interception of the\r\nInsertions of the _Cortical_, are not to be observ’d by the traverse\r\ncut of the _Root_, but by taking off the _Barque_, or the _Cortical\r\nBody_. In the Roots of Trees, they are generally obscure; but in Plants,\r\noften more distinctly apparent; and especially in a _Turnep_: the\r\nappearance whereof, the _Cortical Body_ being stripp’d off, is as a piece\r\nof close-wrought Network, fill’d up with the Insertions of the said\r\n_Cortical Body_. See _Fig. 8_.\r\n\r\nThe next and last distinct Part of the _Root_ is the _Pith_. The\r\nsubstantial nature thereof, is, as was said of the _Insertment_, the\r\nsame likewise with that of the _Parenchyma_ of the Seed. And according\r\nto the best observation we have yet made, ’tis sometimes existent in its\r\n_Radicle_; in which, the two main Branches of the Lobes both meeting, and\r\nbeing osculated together, are thus dispos’d into one round Trunk, and so\r\nenvironing part of the _Parenchyma_, make thereof a _Pith_; as in either\r\nthe _Radicle_, or the young _Root_ of the great _Bean_ or _Lupine_, may,\r\nI think, be well seen.\r\n\r\nBut many times the Original hereof is immediately from the _Cortical\r\nBody_. For in dissection of divers _Roots_ both of Trees and Plants, as\r\nof _Barberry_ or _Mallows_, it is observable, that the _Cortical Body_\r\nand _Pith_ are both of them participant of the same Colour; in the\r\n_Barberry_ both of them tinged yellow, and in _Mallows_ green. In cutting\r\nthe smaller Parts of the Roots of many Plants, as of _Borage_, _Mallows_,\r\n_Parsley_, _Columbine_, &c. ’tis also evident, that the _Lignous Body_ is\r\nnot there in the least Concave, but standeth perfectly in the Center; and\r\nthat the Insertions being gradually multiplied afterwards, the _Pith_ at\r\nlength, towards the thicker parts of the _Root_, shews and enlarges it\r\nself. Whence it appears, that in all such _Roots_, the _Pith_ is not only\r\nof the same substantial nature, and by the Insertions doth communicate\r\nwith the _Cortical Body_; and that it is also more or less augmented\r\nby it; which is true of the _Pith_ of all _Roots_; but is moreover, by\r\nmediation of the said Insertions, wholly originated from it. The various\r\nappearances of the _Insertions_ and _Pith_ from the Fibrous Parts to the\r\ntop of the _Root_, see in _Fig. 9_, _10_, _11_, _12_, _13_, _14_. The\r\nPores of the _Lignous Body_, entire in the said Fibrous Parts, are best\r\nseen when they have lain by a night dry, after cutting.\r\n\r\nA farther evidence hereof are the Proportions betwixt the _Cortical\r\nBody_ and _Pith_. For as about the inferiour Parts of the _Root_, where\r\nthe _Pith_ is small, the _Cortical Body_ is proportionably great; so\r\nabout the top, where the _Pith_ is enlarged, the _Cortical Body_ groweth\r\nproportionably less, _sc._ because by its Insertions, ’tis gradually\r\nbestowed into the _Pith_. Likewise the peculiar frame of some _Roots_,\r\nwherein besides the _Pith_, the _Lignous Body_ being divided into a\r\ndouble Ring, there is also a thick Ring, of a white and soft substance,\r\nstands betwixt them; and is nothing else but the Insertions of the\r\n_Cortical Body_ collected into the said Ring; but, towards the top of the\r\nRoot, being inserted again, thus maketh a large and ample _Pith_; as in\r\n_Fennel_-Roots is seen.\r\n\r\nThe Pores of the _Pith_, as those of the _Cortical Body_, are extended\r\nboth by the breadth and length of the _Root_, much alike; yet are they\r\nmore or less of a greater size than those of the _Cortical Body_.\r\n\r\nThe Proportions of the _Pith_, are various; in Trees, but small; in\r\nPlants generally, very fair; in some making by far the greatest part\r\nof the _Root_; as in a _Turnep_: By reason of the wide circumference\r\nwhereof, and so the finer Concoction and Assimilation of its Sap; that\r\npart which in most old Trunks is a dry and harsh _Pith_, here proves a\r\ntender pleasant meat. The parts of a _Turnep_ in the travers cut see in\r\n_Fig. 8_.\r\n\r\nIn the Roots of very many Plants, as _Turneps_, _Carrots_, &c. the\r\n_Lignous Body_, besides its main utmost Ring, hath divers of its\r\nosculated Fibres dispersed throughout the Body of the _Pith_; sometimes\r\nall alike, and sometimes more especially in, or near, its Center; which\r\nFibres, as they run towards the top of the _Root_, still declining the\r\nCenter, at last collaterally strike into its Circumference; either all\r\nof them, or some few, keeping the Center still; of these principally the\r\n_Lignous Body_ of the Trunk is often originated.\r\n\r\nThese Fibres, although they are so exceeding slender, yet in some\r\n_Roots_, as in that of _Flower-de-liz_, they are visibly concave, each\r\nof them, in their several Cavities also embosoming a very small _Pith_;\r\nthe sight whereof, the Root being cut traverse, and laid in a Window\r\nfor a day or two to dry, may without Glasses be obtained. And this is\r\nthe general account of the _Root_; the declaration of the manner of its\r\ngrowth, with the use and service of its several parts, we shall next\r\nendeavour.\r\n\r\nWe say then, that the _Radicle_ being impregnate, and shot into the\r\nMoulds, the contiguous moisture, by the _Cortical Body_, being a Body\r\nlaxe and Spongy, is easily admitted: Yet not all indiscriminately, but\r\nthat which is more adapt to pass through the surrounding Cuticle. Which\r\ntransient Sap, though it thus becomes fine, yet is not simple; but a\r\nmixture of Particles, both in respect of those originally in the Root,\r\nand amongst themselves, somewhat heterogeneous. And being lodg’d in the\r\n_Cortical Body_ moderately laxe, and of a Circular form; the effect will\r\nbe an easie Fermentation. The _Sap_ fermenting, a separation of Parts\r\nwill follow; some whereof will be impacted to the Circumference of the\r\n_Cortical Body_, whence the Cuticle becomes a Skin; as we see in the\r\ngrowing of the Coats of Cheeses, of the Skin over divers Liquors, and\r\nthe like. Whereupon the _Sap_ passing into the _Cortical Body_, through\r\nthis, as through a _Manica Hippocratis_, is still more finely filtred.\r\nWith which _Sap_, the _Cortical Body_ being dilated as far as its _Tone_,\r\nwithout a solution of Continuity will bear; and the supply of the _Sap_\r\nstill renew’d; and the purest part, as most apt and ready, recedes, with\r\nits due Tinctures, from the said _Cortical Body_, to the _Lignous_.\r\nWhich _Lignous Body_ likewise super-inducing its own proper Tinctures\r\ninto the said _Sap_; ’tis now to its highest preparation wrought up,\r\nand becomes (as they speak of that of an Animal) the Vegetative _Ros_\r\nor _Cambium_: the noblest part whereof is at last coagulated in, and\r\nassimilated to the like substance with the said _Lignous Body_. The\r\nremainder, though not united to it, yet tinctur’d therein, thus retreats,\r\nthat is, by the continual appulse of the _Sap_, is in part carried off\r\ninto the _Cortical Body_ back again, the _Sap_ whereof it now tinctures\r\ninto good Aliment: So that whereas before the _Cortical Body_ was only\r\nrelaxed in its Parts, and so dilated; ’tis now increas’d in real quantity\r\nor number of parts, and so is truly nourish’d. And the _Cortical Body_\r\nbeing saturate with so much of this Vital _Sap_ as serves it self;\r\nand the second Remainders discharged thence to the Skin; this also is\r\nnourish’d and augmented therewith. So that as in an _Animal Body_ there\r\nis no instauration or growth of Parts made by the Bloud only, but the\r\n_Nervous Liquor_ is also thereunto assistant; so is it here: the _Sap_\r\nprepared in the _Cortical Body_, is as the Arterious; and that part\r\nthereof prepared by the _Lignous_, is as the _Nervous Liquor_; which\r\npartly becoming Nutriment to it self, and partly being discharged back\r\ninto the _Cortical Body_, and diffusing its Tincture through the _Sap_\r\nthere, that to the said _Cortical Body_ and _Skin_, becomes also true\r\nNutriment, and so they all now grow.\r\n\r\nIn which growth, a proportion in length and breadth is requisite: which\r\nbeing rated by the benefit of the Plant, both for firm standing and\r\nsufficient Sap, must therefore principally be in length. And because it\r\nis thus requisite, therefore by the constitution of one of its Parts,\r\n_sc._ the _Lignous Body_, it is also made necessary. For the Pores\r\nhereof, in that they are all extended by its length, the _Sap_ also\r\naccording to the frame and site of the said Pores will principally move;\r\nand that way as its _Sap_ moves, the same way will the generation of its\r\nParts also proceed; _sc._ by its length. And the _Lignous Body_ first\r\n(that is, by a priority causal) moving in length it self; the _Cortical_\r\nalso moves therewith. For that which is nourish’d, is extended; but\r\nwhatever is extended, is mov’d; that therefore which is nourish’d, is\r\nmov’d: The _Lignous Body_ then being first nourish’d, ’tis likewise first\r\nmov’d, and so becomes and carries in it the Principle of all Vegetative\r\nmotion in the _Cortical_; and so they both move in length.\r\n\r\nYet as the _Lignous Body_ is the Principle of Motion in the _Cortical_;\r\nso the _Cortical_ is the Moderator of that in the _Lignous_: As in Animal\r\nMotions, the Principle is from the Nerves; yet being once given to the\r\nMuscle or Limb, and that moving proportionably to its structure, the\r\nNerves also are carried in the same motion with it. We suppose therefore,\r\nthat as the principal motion of the _Lignous Body_ is in length, so is\r\nits proper tendency also to ascend: But being much exceeded both in\r\nCompass and Quantity by the _Cortical_ as in the smaller parts of the\r\n_Root_ it is; it must needs therefore be over-born and governed by it;\r\nand so, though not lose its motion, yet make it that way wherein the\r\n_Cortical Body_ may be more obedient to it; which will be by descent:\r\nYet both of them being sufficiently pliable, they are thus capable, where\r\nthe Soyl I may oppose a direct descent, there to divert any way where it\r\nis more penetrable, and so to descend obliquely. For the same reason it\r\nmay also be, that though you set a _Bean_ with the _Radicle_ upward; yet\r\nthe _Radicle_, as it shoots, declining also gradually, is thus arch’d in\r\nform of an Hook, and so at last descends. For every declination from a\r\nperpendicular Line, is a mixed motion betwixt Ascent and Descent; as that\r\nof the _Radicle_ also is, and so seeming to be dependent upon the two\r\ncontrary Tendencies of the _Lignous_ and _Cortical Bodies_. What may be\r\nthe cause of those Tendencies (being most probably external, and perhaps\r\nsomething of a _Magnetisme_) is besides my Task here to enquire.\r\n\r\nNow although the _Lignous Body_, by the position and shape of its Pores,\r\nprincipally groweth in length; yet will it in some degree likewise in\r\nbreadth: For it cannot be supposed that the purest _Sap_ is all received\r\ninto the said Pores; but that part thereof likewise, staying about its\r\n_Superficial parts_, is there tinctur’d and agglutinated to them. And\r\nbecause these Pores are prolonged by its length; therefore is it much\r\nmore laxe and easily divisible that way; as in slitting a Stick, or\r\ncleaving of Timber, and in cutting and hewing them athwart is also seen.\r\nWhence it comes to pass, that in shooting from the Center towards the\r\nCircumference, and there finding more room, its said original Laxity\r\ndoth easily in divers places now become greater, and at length in open\r\nPartments plainly visible. Betwixt which Partments, the _cortical Body_,\r\nbeing bound in on the one hand, by the surrounding Skin and Moulds, and\r\npressed upon by the _Lignous_ on the other, must needs insert it self,\r\nand so move contrary to it, from the Circumference towards the Center:\r\nwhere the said contrary motions continued as begun, they at last meet,\r\nunite, and either make or augment the _Pith_. And thus the _Root_ is\r\nfram’d, and the Skin, the _cortical_ and _Lignous Bodies_, so as is said,\r\nhereunto concurrent. We shall next shew the use of the two other Parts,\r\n_sc_. the _Insertment_ and _Pith_; and first of the _Pith_.\r\n\r\nOne true use of the _Pith_ is for the better Advancement of the _Sap_,\r\nwhereof we shall speak in the next Chapter. The use we here observe is\r\nfor the quicker and higher Fermentation of the _Sap_: For although the\r\nFermentation made in the _Cortical Body_ was well subservient to the\r\nfirst Vegetations, yet those more perfect ones in the _Trunk_ which after\r\nfollow, require a Body more adapted to it, and that is the _Pith_; which\r\nis so necessary, as not to be only common to, but considerably large\r\nin the _Roots_ of most Plants; if not in their inferiour parts, yet at\r\ntheir tops. Where though either deriv’d or amplify’d from the _Cortical\r\nBody_, yet being by its Insertions only, we may therefore suppose, as\r\nthose, so this, to be more finely constituted. And being also from its\r\nco-arctation, while inserted, now free; all its Pores, upon the supply\r\nof the _Sap_, will more or less be amplified: Upon which accounts, the\r\n_Sap_ thereinto received, will be more pure, and its fermentation therein\r\nmore active. And as the _Pith_ is superiour to the _Cortical Body_ by its\r\nConstitution, so by its Place. For as it thus stands central, it hath\r\nthe _Lignous Body_ surrounding it. Now as the Skin is the Fence of the\r\n_Cortical Body_, and that of the _Lignous_; so is the _Lignous_ again a\r\nfar more preheminent one unto the _Pith_; the _Sap_ being here a brisk\r\nLiquor, tunn’d up as in a wooden Cask.\r\n\r\nAnd as the _Pith_ subserves the higher Fermentation of the _Sap_; so do\r\nthe Insertions its purer Distribution; that separation which the parts\r\nof the _Sap_, by being fermented in the _Pith_, were dispos’d for;\r\nbeing, upon its entrance into the Insertions, now made: So that as the\r\nSkin is a Filtre to the _Cortical Body_, so are the Insertions a more\r\npreheminent one to the _Lignous_; and as they subserve the purer, so the\r\nfreer and sufficient distribution of the _Sap_: For the _Root_ enlarging,\r\nand so the _Lignous Body_ growing thicker, although the _Cortical_ and\r\nthe _Pith_ might supply _Sap_ sufficient to the nutrition of its Parts\r\nnext adjacent to them; yet those more inward, must needs be scanted\r\nof their _Aliment_; and so, if not quite starv’d, yet be uncapable of\r\nequal growth: Whereas the _Lignous Body_ being through its whole breadth\r\nfrequently disparted, and the _Cortical Body_ inserted through it; the\r\n_Sap_ by those Insertions, as the Blood by the disseminations of the\r\n_Arteries_, is freely and sufficiently convey’d to its intimate Parts,\r\neven those which from either the _cortical Body_ or the _Pith_ are most\r\nremote. Lastly, as the consequent hereof, they are thus assistant to the\r\nLatitudinal growth of the _Root_; as the _Lignous Body_ to its growth in\r\nlength; so these Insertions of the _Cortical_, to its better growth in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nHaving thus seen the solitary uses of the Several Parts of the _Root_,\r\nwe shall lastly propound our Conjectures of that Design whereto they\r\nare all together concurrent, and that is the Circulation of the _Sap_:\r\nFor the _Sap_ moving through the _cortical Body_, towards the _Pith_,\r\nthrough the Insertions thereinto, obtains a pass: Which passage, the\r\nsuperiour Insertions will not favour; because the _Pith_ standing in the\r\nsame height with them, is there large, the fermenting and course of the\r\n_Sap_ quick, and so its opposition strong. But through the inferiour\r\nit will much more easily enter; because there, through the smalness of\r\nthe _Pith_, the opposition is little, and through the shortness of the\r\nInsertions, the way more open. So that though the _Sap_ may meet with\r\nsome opposition even here, yet here meeting with the least, here it will\r\nbestow it self (feeding the _Lignous Body_ in its passage) into the\r\n_Pith_. Into which fresh _Sap_ still entring, this, yet but crude, will\r\nsubside: that first received and so become a Liquor higher wrought, will\r\nmore easily mount upwards; and moving in the _Pith_, as in the _Arteria\r\nmagna_, in equal altitude with the more superiour Insertions; the most\r\nvolatile parts of all will still continue their direct ascent towards\r\nthe _Trunk_. But those of a middle nature, and, as not apt to ascend,\r\nso being lighter than those beneath them, not to descend neither; they\r\nwill tend from the _Pith_ towards the Insertions in a motion betwixt\r\nboth; through which Insertions (feeding the _Lignous Body_ in its\r\npassage) it is, by the next subsequent _Sap_, discharged off into the\r\n_cortical Body_, as into the _Vena cava_, back again. Wherein, being\r\nstill pursu’d by fresh _Sap_ from the Center, and more occurring from\r\nthe Circumference, towards the inferiour Insertions it thus descends;\r\nthrough which, together with part of the _Sap_ afresh imbib’d from the\r\nMould, it re-enters the _Pith_. From whence, into the _Cortical Body_,\r\nand from thence into the _Pith_, the cruder part thereof reciprocally\r\nis disburs’d; while the most Volatile, not needing the help of a\r\nCirculation, more directly ascendeth towards the _Trunk_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Trunk._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus declar’d the degrees of _Vegetation_ in the _Root_; the\r\ncontinuance hereof in the _Trunk_ shall next be shew’d: in order to\r\nwhich, the Parts whereof this likewise is compounded, we shall first\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\nThat which without dissection shews it self, is the _Coarcture_: I cannot\r\nsay of the _Root_, nor of the _Trunk_; but what I chuse here to mention,\r\nas standing betwixt them, and so being common to them both; all their\r\nParts being here bound in closer together, as in the tops of the grown\r\nRoots of very many Plants, is apparent.\r\n\r\nOf the Parts of the _Trunk_, the first occurring is its _Skin_: The\r\nFormation whereof, is not from the Air, but in the _Seed_, from whence it\r\nis originated; being the production of the Cuticle, there investing the\r\ntwo _Lobes_ and _Plume_.\r\n\r\nThe next Part is the _Cortical Body_; which here in the _Trunk_ is no new\r\nsubstantial formation; but, as is that of the _Root_, originated from the\r\n_Parenchyma_ of the _Seed_; and is only the increase and augmentation\r\nthereof. The _Skin_, this _Cortical Body_ properly so call’d, and (for\r\nthe most part) some Fibers of the _Lignous_ mixed herewith, all together\r\nmake the _Barque_.\r\n\r\nNext, the _Lignous_ Body, which, whether it be visibly divided into\r\nmany softer Fibres, as in _Fennel_, and most Plants; or that its parts\r\nstand more compact and close, shewing one hard, firm and solid piece,\r\nas in Trees; it is in all one and the same Body; and that not formed\r\noriginally in the _Trunk_, but in the _Seed_; being nothing else but the\r\nprolongation of the _Inner Body_ distributed in the _Lobes_ and _Plume_\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nLastly, The _Insertions_ and _Pith_ are here originated likewise from\r\nthe _Plume_, as the same in the _Root_ from the _Radicle_: So that as\r\nto their substantial Parts, the _Lobes_ of the Seed, the _Radicle_ and\r\n_Plume_, the _Root_ and _Trunk_ are all one.\r\n\r\nYet some things are more fairly observable in the _Trunk_. First, the\r\n_Latitudinal_ shootings of the _Lignous Body_, which in _Trunks_ of\r\nseveral years growth, are visible in so many Rings, as is commonly known:\r\nFor several young Fibres of the _Lignous Body_, as in the _Root_, so\r\nhere, shooting into the _Cortical_ one year, and the spaces betwixt them\r\nbeing after fill’d up with more (I think not till) the next, at length\r\nthey become altogether a firm compact Ring; the perfection of one Ring,\r\nand the ground-work of another being thus made concomitantly.\r\n\r\nFrom these Annual younger Fibres it is, that although the _Cortical Body_\r\nand _Pith_ are both of the same substantial nature, and their Pores\r\nlittle different; yet whereas the _Pith_, which the first year is green,\r\nand of all the Parts the fullest of _Sap_, becomes afterwards white and\r\ndry; the _Cortical Body_, on the contrary, so long as the Tree grows,\r\never keepeth green and moist, _sc._ because the said Fibers annually\r\nshoot into, and so communicate with it.\r\n\r\nThe Pores likewise of the _Lignous Body_, many of them in well-grown\r\nTimber, as in Oaken boards, are very conspicuous, in cutting both\r\nlengthwise and traverse; they very seldom run one into another, but keep,\r\nlike so many several Vessels, all along distinct; as by cutting, and so\r\nfollowing any one of them as far as you please, for a Foot or half a\r\nYard, or more together, may be observ’d.\r\n\r\nThese greater Pores, though in Wainscot, Tables, and the like, where they\r\nhave lain long open, they are but meer Vacuities, and so would be thought\r\nto contain only _Sap_ in the Tree, and afterwards only Air; yet upon a\r\nfresh cut, each of them may be seen fill’d up with a light and spongie\r\nBody, which by Glasses, and even by the bare eye, appears to be a perfect\r\n_Pith_; sometimes entire, and sometimes more or less broken.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are a lesser sort; which, by the help of a\r\n_Microscope_, also appear, if not to be fill’d up with a _Pith_, yet to\r\ncontain certain light and filmy parts, more or fewer, of a _Pithy_ nature\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\nAnd these are all the Pores the best Glasses, which, (when upon these\r\nEnquiries) we had at hand, would shew us. But the Learned and most\r\nIngenious Naturalist Mr. _Hook_ sheweth us moreover, besides these, a\r\nthird, and yet smaller sort; the description whereof I find he hath\r\ngiven us amongst his _Microscopical Observations_. Of these Pores (as a\r\nconfirmation of what, in the Second Chapter, I have said of the Pores\r\nof the _Lignous Body_ in general) he also demonstrates; that they are\r\nall continuous and prolonged by the length of the _Trunk_; as are the\r\ngreater ones; the Experiment whereof he imparteth to be, by filling up,\r\nsuppose in a piece of _Char-coal_, all the said Pores with _Mercury_;\r\nwhich appears to pass quite through them, in that by a very good Glass it\r\nis visible in their Orifices at both ends; and without a Glass, by the\r\nweight of the Coal alone, is also manifest.\r\n\r\nUpon farther Enquiry, I likewise find, that the Pores of the _Lignous\r\nBody_ in the _Trunk_ of Plants, which at first only supposed, by the help\r\nof good Glasses are very fairly visible; each Fibre being perforated by\r\n30, 50, 100, or hundreds of Pores. Or what I think is the truest notion\r\nof them, that each Fibre, though it seem to the bare eye to be but one,\r\nyet is indeed a great number of Fibres together; every Pore being not\r\nmeerly a space betwixt the several pores of the Wood, but the Concave\r\nof a Fiber: So that if it be asked, what all that part of a Vegetable,\r\neither Plant or Tree, which is properly call’d the woody part; what all\r\nthat is, I suppose, that is nothing else but a Cluster of innumerable and\r\nmost extraordinary small Vessels or concave Fibres. See _Fig. 15_.\r\n\r\nNext the Insertions of the _Cortical Body_, which in the _Trunk_ of\r\na Tree saw’d athwart, are plainly discerned as they run from the\r\nCircumference toward the Center; the whole Body of the Tree being visibly\r\ncompounded of two distinct Substances, that of the several Rings, and\r\nthat of the Insertions, running cross; shewing that in some resemblance\r\nin a Plain, which the Lines of Latitude and of the Meridian do in a\r\nGlobe. See _Fig. 16_.\r\n\r\nThese Insertions are likewise very conspicuous in Sawing of Trees\r\nlength-wayes into Boards, and those plain’d, and wrought into Leaves for\r\nTables, Wainscot, Trenchers, and the like. In all which, as in course\r\nTrenchers made of _Beech_, and Tables of Oak, there are many parts which\r\nhave a greater smoothness than the rest; and are so many inserted pieces\r\nof the _Cortical Body_; which by reason of those of the _Lignous_, seem\r\nto be discontinuous; although in the _Trunk_ they are extended throughout\r\nits Breadth.\r\n\r\nThese Insertions, although as is said, of a quite distinct substance\r\nfrom the _Lignous Body_, and so no where truly incorporated with it, yet\r\nbeing they are in all parts, the one as the Warp, the other as the Woof,\r\nmutually braced and inter-woven together, they thus constitute one strong\r\nand firmly coherent Body.\r\n\r\nAs the Pores are greater or less, so are the Insertions also: To the bare\r\neye usually the greater only are discernable: But through an indifferent\r\n_Microscope_ there are others also, much more both numerous and small,\r\ndistinctly apparent. So that, I think, we may observe, that as the grand\r\n_Pith_ of the _Trunk_ communicates with, and is augmented by the greater\r\nInsertions; so is the _Pith_ of each greater Pore originated from the\r\nless; and those (at least) pithy parts in the Midling Pores, from others\r\nstill less; and suppose, that the least of all are so far intruded into\r\nthe smallest Pores, as only just to cause a kind of roughness on their\r\nconcave sides, and no more; to what end shall be said. See _Fig. 17_.\r\n\r\nIn none of all these Pores can we observe any thing which may have the\r\ntrue nature and use of Valves, which is easily to admit that, to which\r\nthey will by no means allow a regress. And their non-existence is enough\r\nevident, from what in the first Chapter we have said of the _Lobes_ of\r\nthe _Seed_: in whose _Seminal Root_, were there any _Valves_, it could\r\nnot be, that by a contrary course of the _Sap_, they should ever grow;\r\nwhich yet, where-ever they turn into Dissimilar Leaves, they do. Or if\r\nwe consider the growth of the _Root_, which oftentimes is upward and\r\ndownward both at once.\r\n\r\nThe Insertions here in the _Trunk_ give us likewise a sight of the\r\nposition of their Pores. For in a plained piece of Oak, as in Wainscot,\r\nTables, _&c._ besides the larger Pores of the _Lignous Body_, which\r\nrun by the length of the _Trunk_; the Tract likewise of those of the\r\nInsertions may be observed to be made by the breadth, and so directly\r\ncross. Nor are they continuous as those of the _Lignous Body_, but very\r\nshort, as those both of the _Cortical Body_ and _Pith_, with which the\r\nInsertions, as to their substance are congenerous. Yet they all stand so\r\ntogether, as to be plainly ranked in even Lines or Rows throughout the\r\nbreadth of the _Trunk_: As the Tract of these Pores appear to the naked\r\nEye, see in _Fig. 18_. By the best Microscope I have at hand, I can only\r\nobserve the Ranks of the Pores; not the Pores themselves, saving here and\r\nthere one; wherefore I have not describ’d them.\r\n\r\nThe Pores of the _Pith_ likewise being larger here in the _Trunk_, are\r\nbetter observable than in the _Root_: the width whereof, in comparison\r\nwith their sides so exquisitely thin, may by an Honey-Comb be grosly\r\nexemplified; and is that also which the vast disproportion betwixt the\r\nBulk and weight of a dry _Pith_ doth enough declare. In the _Trunks_ of\r\nsome Plants, they are so ample and transparent, that in cutting both by\r\nthe length and breadth of the _Pith_, some of them, even to the bare eye\r\nwould seem to be considerably extended by the length of the said _Pith_;\r\nwhich once I also thought they were, and that only the rest of them were\r\nbut short and discontinuous, and as ’tis said, somewhat answerable to\r\nthe Cells of an Honey-Comb. This was the nearest we could come to them,\r\nby conjecture, and the assistance of the best Glasses we then had by us,\r\nwhen upon enquiry into the nature of the _Pith:_ But that Worthy Person\r\nnewly mentioned Mr. _Hooke_ sheweth us, that the Pores of the _Pith_,\r\nparticularly of _Elder-Pith_, so far as they are visible, are all alike\r\ndiscontinuous; and that the _Pith_ is nothing else (to use his own words)\r\nbut an heap of Bubbles.\r\n\r\nBesides what this Observation informs us of here, it farther confirms\r\nwhat in the second Chapter we have said of the Original of the _Pith_\r\nand _Cortical Body_, and of the sameness of both their natures with the\r\n_Parenchyma_ of the Seed. For, upon farther enquiry with better Glasses,\r\nI find, that the _Parenchyma_ of the _Plume_ and _Radicle_, and even of\r\nthe _Lobes_ themselves, though not so apparently, is nothing else but a\r\nMass of Bubbles.\r\n\r\nIn the _Piths_ of many Plants, the greater Pores have some of them lesser\r\nones within them, and some of them are divided with cross Membranes: And\r\nbetwixt their several sides, have, I think, other smaller Pores visibly\r\ninterjected. However, that they are all permeable, is most certain. They\r\nstand together not indeterminately, but in even Ranks or Trains; as those\r\nof the Insertions by the breadth, so these by the length of the _Trunk_.\r\nAnd thus far there is a general corresponding betwixt the part of the\r\n_Root_ and _Trunk_: Yet are there some considerable Disparities betwixt\r\nthem; wherein, and how they come to pass, and to what especial use and\r\nend, shall next be said.\r\n\r\nWe say then, that the _Sap_ being in the _Root_ by Filtrations,\r\nFermentations (and in what _Roots_ needful, perhaps by Circulation also)\r\nduly prepar’d; the prime part thereof passing through the intermediate\r\nCoarcture, in due moderation and purity is entertain’d at last into the\r\n_Trunk_. And the _Sap_ of the _Trunk_ being purer and more volatile, and\r\nso it self apt to ascend; the motion of the _Trunk_ likewise will be\r\nmore noble, receiving a disposition and tendency to ascend therewith.\r\nAnd what by the _Sap_ the _Trunk_ is in part dispos’d to, by the\r\nrespective position and quantity of its Parts it is effectually enabled.\r\nFor whereas in the _Root_ the _Lignous Body_ being in proportion with\r\nthe _Cortical_, but little, and all lying close within its Center; it\r\nmust therefore needs be under its controul: on the contrary, being here\r\ncomparatively of greater quantity, and also more dilated, and having\r\ndivers of its Branches standing more abroad towards the Circumference, as\r\nboth in the Leaves and Body of the young _Trunk_ and _Plume_, is seen;\r\nit will in its own tendency to ascend, reduce the _Cortical Body_ to a\r\ncompliance with it.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Trunk_ thus standing from under the restraint of the Mould in\r\nthe open Air, the disposition of its Parts originally different from\r\nthat of the Parts in the Root will not only be continued, but improved:\r\nFor by the force and pressure of the _Sap_ in its collateral Motion,\r\nthe _Lignous Body_ will now more freely and farther be dilated. And\r\nthis being dilated, the _Cortical Body_ also, must needs be inserted;\r\nand is therefore in proportion alwayes more or less smaller here in the\r\n_Trunk_, than in the _Root_. And as the _Cortical Body_ lessens, so the\r\n_Pith_ will be enlarged, and by the same proportion is here greater. And\r\nthe _Pith_ being enlarged it self, its Pores (the _Lignous Body_, upon\r\nits dilatation, as it were tentering and stretching out all their sides)\r\nmust needs likewise be enlarged with it, and accordingly are ever greater\r\nin the _Pith_ of the _Trunk_, than of the _Root_. And the dilatation of\r\nthe _Lignous Body_ still continued, it follows, that whereas the _Pith_\r\ndescendent in the _Root_, is not only in proportion less and less, but\r\nalso in the smaller extremities thereof, and sometimes higher altogether\r\nabsent: Contrariwise, in the _Trunk_ it is not only continued to its\r\ntop, but also there in proportion equally ample with what it is in any\r\nother inferiour part.\r\n\r\nBut although the openness of the Ayr permitting be alwayes alike; yet the\r\nEnergy of the _Sap_ effecting; being different; as therefore that doth,\r\nthe dilatation of the _Trunk_ will also vary. If that be less, so is\r\nthis; as in the _Trunks_ of most Trees: If that be greater, so is this;\r\nas in Plants is common; the _Lignous Body_ being usually so far dilated,\r\nthat the _utmost shootings_ thereof may easily be seen to jut out, and\r\nadjoyn to the Skin. And if the _Sap_ be still of greater energy, it so\r\nfar dilates the _Lignous Body_, as not only to amplifie the _Pith_ and\r\nall its Pores; but also so far to stretch them out, as to make them tear.\r\nWhereupon either running again into the _Cortical Body_, or shrinking up\r\ntowards it, the _Trunk_ thus sometimes becomes an _hollow Stalk_, the\r\n_Pith_ being wholly, or in part voyded. But generally it keeps entire;\r\nand where it doth, the same proportion and respect to the _Lignous_ and\r\n_Cortical Bodies_, as is said. The Consequences of all which will be,\r\nthe strength of the _Trunk_, the security and plenty of the _Sap_, its\r\nFermentation will be quicker, its Distribution more effectual, and its\r\nAdvancement more sufficient.\r\n\r\nFirst, the erect growth and strength of the _Trunk_; this being by the\r\nposition of its several parts effected: For besides the slendering of\r\nthe _Trunk_ still towards the top, the Circumferential position of the\r\n_Lignous Body_ likewise is, and that eminently hereunto subservient: So\r\nthat as the _Lignous Body_ in the smaller part of the _Root_ standing\r\nCentral, we may thence conceive and see their pliableness to any\r\noblique motion; so here, on the contrary, the _Lignous Body_ standing\r\nwide, it thus becomes the strength of the _Trunk_, and most advantageous\r\nto its perpendicular growth. We see the same Design in _Bones_ and\r\n_Feathers_: The strongest _Bones_, as those in the Legs, are hollow.\r\nNow should we suppose the same _Bone_ to be contracted into a Solid\r\nBody, although now it would be no heavier, and in that respect, as apt\r\nfor motion; yet would it have far less strength, than as it is dilated\r\nto a Circumferential posture. And so for _Quills_, which, for the same\r\nReasons, in subserviency to flight, we see how exceeding light they are,\r\nand yet, in comparison with the thinness of their Body, how very strong:\r\nWe see it not only in Nature, but Art. For hence it is that _Joyners_\r\nand _Carpenters_ unite and set together their Timber-pieces and several\r\nWorks oftentimes with double Joynts; which, although they are no thicker\r\nthan a single one might be made, yet standing at a distance, have a\r\ngreater strength than that could have. And the same Architecture will\r\nhave the same use in the _Trunks_ of Plants, in most whereof ’tis very\r\napparent; as for instance, in Corn: For Nature designing its _Sap_ a\r\ngreat Ascent for its higher maturity, hath given it a tall _Trunk_; but\r\nto prevent its ravenous despoiling either of the Ear or Soyl; although it\r\nbe tall, yet are its sides but thin: and because again, it should grow\r\nnot only tall and thriftily, but for avoiding propping up, strongly too;\r\ntherefore, as its height is over-proportioned to the thinness of its\r\nsides, so is its Circumference also; being so far dilated as to parallel\r\na _Quill_ it self. Besides the position of the _Lignous Body_ within the\r\ncompass of a Ring, we see some shootings thereof often standing beyond\r\nthe Circumference of the said Ring, making sometimes a triangular, oftner\r\na quadrangular Body of the _Trunk_; to the end, that the Ring being but\r\nthin, and not self-sufficient, these, like Splinters to _Bones_, might\r\nadd strength and stability to it.\r\n\r\nNext, the security and plenty of the _Sap_. For should the _Lignous\r\nBody_, as it doth in the _Root_, its smaller parts, stand Central here\r\nalso, and so the _Cortical_ wholly surround it: the greater part of the\r\n_Sap_ would thus be more immediately expos’d to the Sun and ayr; and\r\nbeing lodg’d in a laxe Body, by them continually be prey’d upon, and\r\nas fast as supplied to the _Trunk_, be exhausted. Whereas the _Pith_\r\nstanding in the Center, the _Sap_ therein being not only most remote\r\nfrom the Ayr and Sun, but by the _Barque_, and especially the _Wood_,\r\nbeing also surrounded and doubly immur’d, will very securely and\r\ncopiously be conveyed to all the Collateral parts, and (as shall be said\r\nhow) the top of the _Trunk_.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Sap_ by the amplitude, and great porosity of the _Pith_ being\r\nherein more copious, its Fermentation also will be quicker; which we see\r\nin all Liquors by standing in a greater quantity together, proceeds more\r\nkindly: And being tunn’d up within the _Wood_, is at the same time not\r\nonly secur’d from loss, but all extream mutations, the Day being thus not\r\ntoo hot, nor the Night too cold for it.\r\n\r\nAnd the Fermentation hereof being quicker, its motion also will be\r\nstronger, and its distribution more effectual, not only to the\r\ndilatation of the _Trunk_, but likewise the shooting out of the Branches.\r\nWhence it is, that in the Bodies of Trees, the _Barque_ of it self,\r\nthough it be sappy, and many Fibres of the _Lignous Body_ mixed with it,\r\nyet seldom sendeth forth any; and that in Plants, those with the least\r\n_Pith_ (other advantages not supplying this defect) have the fewest or\r\nsmallest Branches, or other collateral Growths: and that _Corn_, which\r\nhath no _Pith_, hath neither any Branches.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Advancement of the _Sap_ will hence also be more ready and\r\nsufficient. For the understanding where, and how, we suppose that in all\r\n_Trunks_ whatsoever there are two parts joyntly hereunto subservient.\r\nIn some the _Lignous Body_ and the _Cortical_, as in older _Trunks_,\r\nthe _Pith_ being either excluded or dried: But in most, principally\r\nthe _Lignous Body_ and _Pith_; as in most Annual Growths of Trees; but\r\nespecially Plants, where the _Cortical Body_ is usually much and often\r\nwholly inserted.\r\n\r\nOf the _Lignous_ body it is so apparent by its Pores, or rather by its\r\nVessels, that we need no farther evidence. For to what end are Vessels\r\nbut for the conveyance of Liquor? And is that also, which upon cutting\r\nthe young Branch of a Sappy Tree or Plant, by an accurate and steady view\r\nmay be observed. But when I say the Pores of the _Lignous Body_, I mean\r\nprincipally them of the younger shootings, both those which make the new\r\nRing, and those which are mixed with the _Cortical Body_ in the _Barque_:\r\nthat which ascendeth by the Pores of the older Wood, being probably,\r\nbecause in less quantity, more in form of a Vapour, than a Liquor. Yet\r\nthat which drenching into the sides of its Pores, is with all thereunto\r\nsufficient Aliment; as we see _Orpine_, _Onions_, &c. only standing in\r\na moyster Ayr will often grow; And being likewise in part supplied by\r\nthe Insertions from the younger Shoots: But especially, because as it\r\nis but little, so it serveth only for the growth of the said _Older\r\nWood_, and no more; whereas the more copious Aliment ascendent by the\r\nyounger Shoots, subserves not only their own growth, but the generation\r\nof others; and is besides with that in the _Cortical Body_ the Fountain\r\nof _Perspirations_, which we know even in Animals are much more abundant\r\nthan the _Nutritive parts_; and doubtless in a _Vegetable_ are still much\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut these Pores, although they are a free and open way to the ascending\r\n_Sap_; yet that meer Pores or Vessels should be able of themselves\r\nto advance the _Sap_ with that speed, strength & plenty, and to that\r\nheight, as is necessary, cannot probably be supposed. It follows then,\r\nthat herein we must grant the _Pith_ a joynt service. And why else in\r\nthe smaller parts of the _Root_, where the _Pith_ is often wanting, are\r\nthe Pores there greater? Why is the _Pith_ in all primitive growths the\r\nmost _Sappy_ part, why hath it so great a stock of _Sap_, if not after\r\ndue maturation within it self still to be disbursed into the Fibres of\r\nthe _Lignous Body_? Why are the annual growths of all both Plants and\r\nTrees with great Piths, the quickest and the longest? But how are the\r\nPores of the _Pith_ permeable? That they are so, both from their being\r\ncapable of a repletion with _Sap_, and of being again wholly emptied of\r\nit, and again, instead thereof fill’d with Ayr, is as certain as that\r\nthey are Pores. That they are permeable, by the breadth, appears from the\r\ndilatation of the _Lignous Body_, and from the production of Branches,\r\nas hath been, and shall hereafter be said. And how else is there a\r\nCommunion betwixt this and the _Cortical Body_? That they are so also,\r\nby the length, is probable, because by the best _Microscope_ we cannot\r\nyet observ, that they are visibly more open by the breadth, than by the\r\nlength. And withal are ranked by the length, as those of the Insertions\r\nby the breadth of the _Trunk_. But if you set a piece of dry _Elder-Pith_\r\nin some tinged Liquor, why then doth it not penetrate the Pores, so as\r\nto ascend through the Body of the _Pith_? The plain reason is, because\r\nthey are all fill’d with Ayr. Whereas the _Pith_ in a Vegetating Plant,\r\nas its Parts or Pores are still generated, they are at the same time\r\nalso fill’d with _Sap_; which, as ’tis gradually spent, is still repair’d\r\nby more succeeding, and so the Ayr still kept out; as in all primitive\r\ngrowths, and the _Pith_ of _Elder_ it self: Yet the same _Pith_, by\r\nreason of the following Winter, wanting a more copious and quick supply\r\nof _Sap_, thus once become, ever after keeps dry. And since in the\r\naforesaid Trial the Liquor only ascends by the sides of the _Pith_, that\r\nis of its broken Pores, we should thence by the same reason conclude that\r\nthey are not penetrable by the breadth neither, and so no way; and then\r\nit need not be ask’d what would follow. But certainly the _Sap_ in the\r\nPores of the _Pith_ is discharged and repaired every moment, as by its\r\nshriv’ling up; upon cutting the Plant is evident.\r\n\r\nWe suppose then, that as the _Sap_ ascendeth into the _Trunk_ by the\r\n_Lignous Body_, so partly also by the _Pith_. For a piece of _Cotton_\r\nwith one end immers’d in some tinged Liquor, and with the other erect\r\nabove, though it will not imbibe the Liquor so far as to over-run at\r\nthe top, yet so as to advance towards it, it will; so here, the _Pith_\r\nbeing a porous and spongy Body, and in its Vegetating state its Pores\r\nalso permeable, as a curious Filtre of Natures own contrivance, it thus\r\nadvanceth, or as people use to say, sucks up the _Sap_. Yet as it is seen\r\nof the Liquor in the Cotton; so likewise are we to suppose it of the\r\n_Sap_ in the _Pith_; that though it riseth up for some way, yet is their\r\nsome term, beyond which it riseth not, and towards which the motion of\r\nthe ascending _Sap_ is more and more broken, weak and slow, and so the\r\nquantity thereof less and less. But because the _Sap_ moveth not only\r\nby the length, but breadth of the _Pith_; at the same time therefore\r\nas it partly ascendeth by the _Pith_, it is likewise in part pressed\r\ninto the _Lignous Body_ or into its Pores. And since the motion of the\r\n_Sap_ by the breadth of the _Pith_ not being far continued, and but\r\ncollateral, is more prone and easie than the perpendicular, or by its\r\nlength; it therefore follows, that the collateral motion of the _Sap_,\r\nat such a height or part of the _Pith_, will be equally strong with the\r\nperpendicular at another part, though somewhat beneath it; and that\r\nwhere the perpendicular is more broken and weak, the collateral will be\r\nless; and consequently where the perpendicular tendency of the _Sap_\r\nhath its term, the collateral tendency thereof, and so its pressure into\r\nthe Pores of the _Lignous Body_ will still continue. Through which, in\r\nthat they are small, and so their sides almost contiguous, the _Sap_\r\nas fast as pressed into them will easily run up; as betwixt the two\r\nhalves of a Stick first slit, and then tied somewhat loosely together,\r\nmay also any Liquor be observed to do. And the sides of the said Pores\r\nbeing not smooth, but by the intrusion of the smallest insertions made\r\nsomewhat rough; by that means the higher and more facile ascent of the\r\n_Sap_ therein will farther be promoted. By all which Advantages the\r\nfacility and strength of that ascent will be continued higher in the said\r\nPores than in the _Pith_. Yet since this also, as well as that in the\r\n_Pith_ will have its term; the _Sap_, although got thus far, would yet\r\nat last be stagnant, or at least its ascent be very sparing, slow and\r\nfeeble, if not some way or other re-inforced. Wherefore, as the _Sap_\r\nmoving by the breadth of the _Pith_, presseth thence into the Pores of\r\nthe _Lignous Body_; so having well fill’d these, is in part by the same\r\nCollateral motion disbursed back into a yet higher Region of the _Pith_.\r\nBy which partly, and partly by that portion of the _Sap_, which in its\r\nperpendicular ascent was before lodged therein; ’tis thus here, as in any\r\ninferiour place equally repleat. Whereupon the force and vigour of the\r\nperpendicular motion of the _Sap_ herein will likewise be renew’d; and\r\nso its Collateral motion also, and so its pressure into the Pores of the\r\n_Lignous Body_, and consequently its ascent therein; and so by a pressure\r\nfrom these into the _Pith_, and from the _Pith_ into these reciprocally\r\ncarried on, a most ready and copious ascent of the _Sap_ will be\r\ncontinued from the bottom to the top, though of the highest _Trunk_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Appendix._\r\n\r\n_Of Trunk-Roots and Claspers._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinct Parts whereof these are constituted, are the same with those\r\nof the _Trunk_, and but the continuation of them.\r\n\r\n_Trunk-Roots_ are of two kinds: Of the one, are those that vegetate by a\r\ndirect descent: The place of their Eruption is sometimes all along the\r\n_Trunk_; as in _Mint_, &c. Sometimes only at its utmost point, as in the\r\n_Bramble_.\r\n\r\nThe other sort are such as neither ascend nor descend, but shoot forth\r\nat right Angles with the _Trunk_; which therefore, though as to their\r\nOffice, they are true _Roots_, yet as to their Nature, they area _Middle\r\nthing_ betwixt a _Root_ and a _Trunk_.\r\n\r\n_Claspers_, though they are but of one kind, yet their nature is double;\r\nnot a mean betwixt that of the _Root_ and that of the _Trunk_, but\r\na compound of both; as in their Circumvolutions, wherein they often\r\nmutually ascend and descend, is seen.\r\n\r\nThe use of these Parts may be observed as the _Trunk_ mounts, or as it\r\ntrails. In the mounting of the _Trunk_, they are for support and supply:\r\nFor support, we see the _Claspers_ of _Vines_; the Branches whereof being\r\nvery long, fragile and slender, unless by their _Claspers_ they were\r\nmutually contain’d together, they must needs by their own weight, and\r\nthat of their Fruit, undecently fall, and be also liable to frequent\r\nbreaking. So that the whole care is divided betwixt the Gardener and\r\nNature; the Gardener with his Ligaments of Leather secures the main\r\nBranches; and Nature with these of her own finding, secures the less.\r\nTheir Conveniency to which end, is seen in their Circumvolutions, a\r\nmotion not proper to any other Part: As also in their toughness or\r\nstrength, though much more slender than the Branches whereon they are\r\nappendent.\r\n\r\nFor Supply, we see the _Trunk-Roots_ of _Ivy_: For mounting very high,\r\nand being of a closer Constitution than that of a _Vine_, the _Sap_\r\ncould not be sufficiently supplied to the upper Sprouts, unless these\r\nto the _Mother-Root_ were joyntly assistant. Yet serve they for support\r\nlikewise; whence they shoot out, not as in _Cresses_, _Brook-lime_, &c.\r\nreciprocally on each side, but commonly all in one; that so they may be\r\nfastened at the nearest hand.\r\n\r\nIn the Trailing of the _Trunk_, they serve for stabiliment, propagation\r\nand shade. For stabiliment, we see the _Claspers_ of _Cucumbers_: For\r\nthe _Trunk_ and _Branches_ being long and fragile, the Brushes of the\r\nWinds would injuriously hoise them to and fro, to the dammage both of\r\nthemselves and their tender Fruit, were they not by these Ligaments\r\nbrought to good Association and Settlement.\r\n\r\nAs for this end, so for Propagation, we see the _Trunk-Roots_ of\r\n_Camomile_. Whence we have the reason of the common observation, that it\r\ngrows better by being trod upon: the Mould, where too laxe, being thus\r\nmade to lie more conveniently about the said _Trunk-Roots_ newly bedded\r\ntherein; and is that which we see also effected in Rowling of _Corn_.\r\n\r\nFor both these ends, we see the _Trunk-Roots_ of _Strawberries_; as\r\nalso for shade; for in that we see all _Strawberries_ delight; and by\r\nthe trailing of the Plant is well obtain’d: So that as we are wont to\r\ntangle the Twigs of Trees together to make an _Arbour Artificial_; the\r\nsame is here done to make a _Natural one_; as likewise by the _Claspers_\r\nof _Cucumbers_: For the Branches of the one by the Linking of their\r\n_Claspers_, and of the other by the Tethering of their _Trunk-Roots_,\r\nbeing couched together; their tender fruits thus lie under the Umbrage of\r\na _Bower_ made of their own Leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Germen, Branch, and Leaf._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parts of the _Germen_ and _Branch_, are the same with those of the\r\n_Trunk_; the same _Skin_, _Cortical_ and _Lignous Bodies_, _Insertment_\r\nand _Pith_, hereinto propagated, and distinctly observable herein.\r\n\r\nFor upon Enquiry into the Original of a _Branch_ or _Germen_, it appears,\r\nThat it is not from the _Superficies_ of the _Trunk_, but so deep, as to\r\ntake with the _Cortical_, the _Lignous Body_ into it self; and that not\r\nonly from its Circumference, but (so as to take the _Pith_ in also) from\r\nits _Inner_ or _Central parts_. Divers whereof may commonly be seen to\r\nshoot out into the _Pith_; from which _Shoots_ the surrounding and more\r\nsuperiour _Germens_ are originated; in like manner as the _Lignous Body_\r\nof the _Trunk_ is sometimes principally from those Fibrous _Shoots_ which\r\nrun along the _Pith_ in the _Root_.\r\n\r\nThe manner wherein usually the _Germen_ and _Branch_ are fram’d, is\r\nbriefly thus: The _Sap_ (as is said, _Chap. 3._) mounting in the\r\n_Trunk_, will not only by its length, but by its breadth also, through\r\nthe _Insertions_ partly move. Yet, its Particles being not all alike\r\nqualified, in different degrees: Some are more gross and sluggish;\r\nof which we have the formation of a Circle of Wood only; or of an\r\nAnnual Ring: Others are more brisk; and by these we have the _Germen_\r\npropagated. For by the vigour of their own motion from the Center, they\r\nimpress an equal tendency on some of the inner parts of the _Lignous\r\nBody_ next adjacent to the _Pith_, to move with them. And since the\r\n_Lignous Body_ is not entire, but frequently disparted; through these\r\ndispartments, the said interiour Parts, upon their Nutrition, actually\r\nshoot; not only towards the Circumference, so as to make part of a Ring,\r\nbut even beyond it, in order to the production of a _Germen_. And the\r\n_Lignous Body_ thus moving, and carrying the _Cortical_ along with it;\r\nthey both make a force upon the _Skin_: Yet their motion being most even\r\nand gradual, that force is such likewise; not to cause the least breach\r\nof its parts, but gently to carry it on with themselves; and so partly\r\nby the extension of its already existent parts, as of those of Gold in\r\ndrawing of Guilded Wyer; and partly by the accretion of new ones, as in\r\nthe enlarging of a Bubble above the Surface of the Water, it is extended\r\nwith them to their utmost growth. In which growth, the _Germen_ being\r\nprolonged, and so displaying its several parts, as when a _Prospective_\r\nor _Telescope_ is drawn out, thus becomes a _Branch_.\r\n\r\nThe same way as the propagation of the Parts of a _Germen_ is contriv’d\r\nis its due nutrition also: For being originated from the inner part of\r\nthe _Lignous Body_, ’tis nourished with the best fermented _Sap_ in\r\nthe _Trunk_, _sc._ that next adjacent to it in the _Pith_. Besides,\r\nsince all its Parts, upon their shooting forth, divaricate from their\r\nperpendicular, to a cross Line, as these and the other grow and thrive\r\ntogether, bind and throng each other into a Knot; through which Knot the\r\n_Sap_ being strain’d, ’tis thus in due moderation & purity delivered up\r\ninto the Branch.\r\n\r\nAnd for Knots, they are so necessary, as to be seen not only where\r\ncollateral Branches put forth; but in such Plants also as shoot up in\r\none single _Trunk_; as in _Corn_; wherein, as they make for the strength\r\nof the _Trunk_; so by so many percolations as they are Knots, for the\r\ntransmission of the _Sap_ more and more refined towards the Ear. So that\r\nthe two general uses of Knots are for firmer standing, and finer growth.\r\n\r\nLastly, as the due Formation and Nutrition of the _Germen_ are provided\r\nfor, so is its security also; which both in its position upon the\r\n_Trunk_, and that of its Parts among themselves may be observed. The\r\nposition of its Parts shall be considered in speaking of the Leaf. As to\r\nits standing in the _trunk_, ’tis alwayes betwixt the _trunk_ or _Elder\r\nBranch_, and the _Basis_ of the Stalk of the _Leaf_; whereby it is not\r\nonly guarded from the Injuries of any contingent Violence, but also from\r\nthe more piercing assaults of the Cold, so long till in time ’tis grown,\r\nas larger, so more hardy. The manner and uses of the position of every\r\n_Germen_, considered as after it becomes a _Branch_, hath already been by\r\nthe Ingenious Mr. _Sharrock_ very well observed; to whom I refer.\r\n\r\nUpon the prolongation of the _Germen_ into a _Branch_, its _Leaves_\r\nare thus display’d. The Parts whereof are substantially the same with\r\nthose of a _Branch_: For the Skin of the Leaf is only the ampliation of\r\nthat of the _Branch_; being partly by the accretion of new, & partly\r\nthe extention of its already existent parts (dilated as in making of\r\n_Leaf-Gold_) into its present breadth. The Fibres or Nerves dispersed\r\nthrough the Leaf, are only the Ramifications of the _Branch_’s Wood,\r\nor _Lignous Body_. The _Parenchyma_ of the Leaf which lies betwixt the\r\nNerves, and as in Gentlewomens Needle-works, fills all up, is nothing\r\nelse but the continuations of the _Cortical Body_, or inner part of the\r\n_Barque_ from the _Branch_ into it self, as in most Plants with a fat\r\nLeaf, may easily be seen.\r\n\r\nThe Fibres of the _Leaf_ neither shoot out of the _Branch_ nor _Trunk_,\r\nnor stand in the _Stalk_, in an even Line; but alwayes in either an\r\nAngular or Circular posture, and usually making either a Triangle, or a\r\nSemi-Circle, or Cord of a Circle; as in _Cycory_, _Endive_, _Cabbage_,\r\n&c. may be observed: And if the Leaf have but one main Nerve, that also\r\nis postur’d in a Circular or Lunar Figure; as in _Mint_ and others. The\r\nusual number of these Nerves or Fibres is 3, 5, or 7. See the _Figures_\r\nfrom 20, to 29.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the said Positions of the Fibres in the _Stalk_ of the\r\n_Leaf_, is for its more erect growth, and greater strength; which, were\r\nthe position of the said Fibres in an even Line, and so the Stalk it\r\nself, as well as the Leaf flat, must needs have been defective; as from\r\nwhat we have said of the Circumferential posture of the _Lignous Body_ in\r\nthe _Trunk_, we may better conceive.\r\n\r\nAs likewise for the security of its _Sap_: For by this means it is, that\r\nthe several Fibres, and especially the main or middle Fibre of the Leaf,\r\ntogether with a considerable part of the _Cortical Body_, are so disposed\r\nof, as to jut out, not from its upper, but its back, or nether plain.\r\nWhence the whole Leaf, reclining backward, becomes a Canopy to them,\r\ndefending them from those Injuries which from colder Blasts, or an hotter\r\nSun, they might otherwise sustain. So that by a mutual benefit, as these\r\ngive suck to all the Leaf, so that again protection to these.\r\n\r\nThese Fibres are likewise the immediate visible Cause of the shape of the\r\nLeaf: For if the nethermost Fibre or Fibres in the Stalk be in proportion\r\ngreater, the Leaf is long, as in _Endive_, _Cycory_, and others: If all\r\nof a more equal size, it spreads rounder, as in _Ivy_, _Doves-foot_,\r\n_Colts foot_, &c. And although a _Dock-Leaf_ be very long, whose Fibres\r\nnotwithstanding, as they stand higher in the Stalk, are disposed into a\r\nCircle all of an equal size; yet herein a peculiar fibre, standing in the\r\nCenter betwixt the rest, and running through the length of the Leaf, may\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\nIn correspondence also to the size and shape of these Fibres, is the Leaf\r\nflat: In that either they are very small, or if larger, yet they never\r\nmake an entire Circle or Ring; but either half of one, as in _Borage_, or\r\nat most three parts of one, as in _Mullen_, may be seen. For if either\r\nthey were so big, as to contain; or so entire, as perfectly to include\r\na _Pith_, the Energy of the _Sap_ in that _Pith_, would cause the said\r\n_Lignous Ring_ to shoot forth on every side, as it doth in the _Root_ or\r\n_Trunk_: But the said Fibres being not figur’d into an entire Ring, but\r\nso as to be open; on that hand therefore where open, they cannot shoot\r\nany thing directly from themselves, because there they have nothing to\r\nshoot; and the _Sap_ having also a free vent through the said opening,\r\nagainst that part therefore which is thereunto opposite, it can have no\r\nforce; and so neither will they shoot forth on that hand; and so will\r\nthey consequently that way only which the force of the _Sap_ directs,\r\nwhich is only on the right and left.\r\n\r\nThe several Fibres in the Stalk, are all inosculated in the Leaf, with\r\nvery many Sub-divisions; according as these Fibres are inosculated\r\nnear, or at, or shoot directly to the edge of the Leaf, is it even or\r\nscallop’d. Where these Inosculations are not made, there we have no\r\n_Leaves_, but only a company of _Ramulets_, as in _Fennel_.\r\n\r\nThe Formations and Fouldings of Leaves have one Date, or are the\r\ncontemporary works of Nature; each Leaf obtaining its distinct shape,\r\nand proper posture together; both being perfect, not only in the outer,\r\nbut Central and minutest Leaves, which sometimes are five hundred times\r\nsmaller than the outer; both which in the Cautious opening of a _Germen_\r\nmay be seen.\r\n\r\nNor is there greater Art in the Forms, than in the Foulds or Postures\r\nof _Leaves_; both answerably varying, as this or that way they may be\r\nmost agreeable. Of the _Quincuncial_ posture, so amply instanc’d in by\r\nthe Learned Dr. _Brown_, I shall omit to speak. Others there are, which\r\nthough not all so universal, yet equally necessary where they are; giving\r\ntwo general advantages to the Leaves, Elegancy and Security, _sc._ in\r\ntaking up, so far as their Forms will bear, the least room; and in being\r\nso conveniently couch’d, as to be capable of receiving protection from\r\nother parts, or of giving it to one another; as for instance,\r\n\r\nFirst, There is the _Plain-Lap_, where the Leaves are all laid\r\nsomewhat convexly one over another, but not plaited; being to the\r\nlengthy, breadth and number of Leaves most agreeable; as in the Buds\r\nof _Pear-tree_, _Plum-tree_, &c. But where the Leaves are not thick\r\nset, as to stand in the _Plain-lap_, there we have the _Plicature_;\r\nas in _Rose-tree_, _Strawberry_, _Cinquefoyl_, _Burnet_, &c. For the\r\nLeaves being here plaited, and so lying in half their breadth, and\r\ndivers of them thus also collaterally set together, the thickness of\r\nthem all, and half their breadth, are much alike dimensions; by which\r\nthey stand more secure within themselves, and in better consort with\r\nother _Germen-Growths_ in the same Truss. If the Leaves be much indented\r\nor jagg’d, now we have the same Duplicature; where there are divers\r\nPlaits in the same Leaf, or Labels of a Leaf, but in distinct Sets, a\r\nlesser under a greater; as in _Tansey_, &c. When the Leaves stand not\r\ncollaterally, but single, and that they are moreover very broad; then\r\nwe have the _Multiplicature_; as in _Gooseberries_, _Mallows_, &c. the\r\nPlaits being not only divers in the same Leaf, but of the same set\r\ncontinuant, and so each Leaf gather’d up in five, seven, or more Foulds,\r\nin the same manner as our Gentlewomens Fans: Where either the thickness\r\nof the Leaf will not permit a _flat lap_, or the fewness of their\r\nnumber, or the smallness of their Fibres, will allow the _Rowl_, there\r\nthis may be observed; which is sometimes single, as in _Bears-Ears_;\r\nsometimes double, the two _Rowls_ beginning at each edge of the Leaf,\r\nand meeting in the middle. Which again, is either the _Fore-Rowl_, or\r\nthe _Back-Rowl_. If the Leaf be design’d to grow long, now we have the\r\n_Back-Rowl_, as in _Docks_, _Primroses_, &c. For the main Fibres, and\r\nthat with a considerable part of the _Cortical Body_ standing prominent\r\nfrom the _Back-plain_ of the Leaf, they thus stand securely couch’d up\r\nbetwixt the two _Rowls_; on whose security the growth of the Leaf in\r\nlength depends. But _Bears-Ears_, _Violets_, &c. upon contrary respects,\r\nare rowled up inwards. Lastly, there is the _Tre-Rowl_, as in _Fern_;\r\nthe _Labels_ whereof, though all rowled up to the _main Stem_, yet could\r\nnot stand so firm and secure from the Injuries either of the Ground\r\nor Weather, unless to the _Rowls_ in breadth, that by the length were\r\nsuper-induc’d; the _Stalk_ or _main Stem_ giving the same protection\r\nhere, which in other Plants by the Leaves, or some particular _Mantling_,\r\nis contriv’d.\r\n\r\nFor according to the Form and Foulding of every Leaf or _Germen_, is its\r\nprotection order’d; about six wayes whereof may be observ’d; _sc._ by\r\n_Leaves_, _Surfoyles_, _Interfoyles_, _Stalks_, _Hoods_ and _Mantlings_.\r\nTo add to what we have above given, one or two Instances. Every Bud,\r\nbesides its proper Leaves, is covered with divers Leafy _Pannicles_ or\r\n_Surfoyls_; which, what the Leaves are to one another, are that to them\r\nall: For not opening except gradually, they admit not the Weather, Wet,\r\nSun or Ayr, to approach the Leaves, except by degrees respondent, and as\r\nthey are leisurely inur’d to bear them. Sometimes, besides _Surfoyls_,\r\nthere are also many _Interfoyls_ set betwixt the Leaves, from the\r\nCircumference to the Center of the _Bud_; as in the _Hasel_: For the\r\nFibres of these Leaves standing out so far from a plain surface; they\r\nwould, if not thus shelter’d, lie too much expos’d and naked to the\r\nSeverities of the Weather. Where none of all the Protections above-named,\r\nare convenient, there the Membranes of the Leaves by continuation in\r\ntheir first forming (together with some Fibres of the _Lignous Body_) are\r\ndrawn out into so many _Mantles_ or _Veins_; as in _Docks_, _Snakeweed_,\r\n&c. For the Leaves here being but few, yet each Leaf and its Stalk being\r\nboth exceeding long, at the bottom whereof the next following Leaf still\r\nsprings up; the form and posture of all is such, as supersedes all the\r\nother kinds of protection, and so each Leaf apart is provided with a Veil\r\nto it self.\r\n\r\nThe Uses of the Leaves, I mean in respect of their service to the Plant\r\nit self, are these; first, for Protection, which, besides what they give\r\nto one another, they afford also to the _Flower_ and _Fruit_: To the\r\n_Flower_ in their Foulds; that being, for the most part, born and usher’d\r\ninto the open Ayr by the _Leaves_. To the _Fruit_, when afterwards they\r\nare display’d, as in _Strawberries_, _Grapes_, _Rasps_, _Mulberries_,\r\n&c. On which, and the like, should the Sun-Beams immediately strike,\r\nespecially while they are young, they would quite shrivel them up;\r\nbut being by the Leaves screened off, they impress the circumjacent\r\nAyr so far only as gently to warm the said Fruits, and so to promote\r\ntheir Fermentation and Growth. And accordingly we see, that the Leaves\r\nabove-named are exceeding large in proportion to the _Fruits_: whereas\r\nin _Pear-trees_, _Apple-trees_, &c. the _Fruit_ being of a solider\r\n_Parenchyma_, and so not needing the like protection, are usually equal\r\nwith, and often wider in Diameter than the _Leaves_.\r\n\r\nAnother use is for Augmentation; or, the capacity for the due spreading\r\nand ampliation of a Tree or Plant, are its Leaves: For the _Lignous\r\nBody_ being divided into small Fibres, and these running all along their\r\nlax and spongie _Parenchyma_; they are thus a Body fit for the imbibition\r\nof _Sap_ and easie growth. Now the _Sap_ having a free reception into the\r\nLeaves, it still gives way to the next succeeding in the _Branches_ and\r\n_Trunk_, and the voyding of the _Sap_ in these, for the mounting of that\r\nin the _Root_, and ingress of that in the Mould. But were there no Leaves\r\nto make a free reception of _Sap_, it must needs be stagnant in all the\r\nparts to the _Root_, and so the _Root_ being clogg’d, its fermenting and\r\nother Offices will be voyded, and so the due growth of the whole. As in\r\nthe motion of a Watch, although the original term thereof be the Spring,\r\nyet the capacity for its continuance in a due measure throughout all the\r\nWheels, is the free and easie motion of the Ballance.\r\n\r\nLastly, As the Leaves subserve the more copious advancement, so the\r\nhigher purity of the _Sap_: For this being well fermented both in the\r\nRoot, and in its Ascent through the _Trunk_, and so its Parts prepar’d\r\nto a farther separation; the grosser ones are still deposited into the\r\nLeaves; the more elaborate and essential only thus supplied to the\r\n_Flower_, _Fruit_ and _Seed_, as their convenient Aliment. Whence it\r\nis, that where the _Flowers_ are many and large, into which the more\r\nodorous Particles are copiously receiv’d, the green Leaves have little\r\nor no smell; as those of _Rose-tree_, _Carnations_, _French-Marigold_,\r\n_Wood-bind_, _Tulips_; &c. But on the contrary, where the Flowers are\r\nnone or small, the green Leaves themselves are likewise of a strong\r\nsavour; as those of _Wormwood_, _Tansie_, _Baum_, _Mint_, _Rue_,\r\n_Geranium Moschatum_, _Angelica_, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Appendix._\r\n\r\n_Of Thorns, Hairs and Globulets._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thorns_ are of two kinds, _Lignous_ and _Cortical_. Of the first are\r\nsuch as those of the _Hawthorn_, and are constituted of all the same\r\nsubstantial Parts whereof the _Germen_ it self, and in a like proportion:\r\nwhich also in their Infancy are set with the resemblances of divers\r\nminute Leaves. In affinity with these are the _Spinets_ or _Thorny\r\nPrickles_ upon the Verges and Tops of divers Leaves, as of _Barberry_,\r\n_Holly_, _Thistle_, _Furze_, and others; all which I think are the\r\nfilamentous extremities of the _Lignous Body_ sheathed in the _Skin_.\r\n\r\n_Cortical Thorns_ are such as those of the _Rasberry_ Bush, being not,\r\nunless in a most extraordinary small proportion propagated from the\r\n_Lignous Body_, but almost wholly from the _Cortical_ and _Skin_, or from\r\nthe _Barque_.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this _Thorn_ may farther argue what in the Second Chapter\r\nwe supposed; _sc._ That as the proper tendency of the _Lignous Body_, is\r\nto ascend, so of the _Cortical_ to descend. For as the _Lignous Thorn_,\r\nlike other Parts upon the _Trunk_, in its growth ascends; this being\r\nalmost wholly _Cortical_, pointeth downward. The use of _Thorns_ the very\r\nIngenious Mr. _Sharrock_ observed.\r\n\r\nUpon the Leaves of divers Plants two Productions shew themselves, _sc._\r\n_Hairs_ and _Globulets_. Of _Hairs_, only one kind is taken notice of,\r\nalthough they are various. Ordinarily they are plain; which when fine and\r\nthick set, as on most _Hairy Buds_; or fine and long, as on those of the\r\n_Vine_, we call them _Down_.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes they are not plain, but branched out, from the bottom\r\nto the top, reciprocally on every side, in some resemblance to a\r\n_Stags-Horn_; as in _Mullen_. And sometimes they are _Astral_, as upon\r\n_Lavender_, and some other Leaves, and especially those of _Wild Olive_;\r\nwherein every _Hair_ rising in one round entire Basis a little way above\r\nthe Surface of the Leaf, is then disparted. Star-like, into several,\r\nfour, five or six points, all standing at right Angles with the said\r\nperpendicular Basis.\r\n\r\nThe Uses of Hairs are for Distinction and Protection. That of Distinction\r\nis but secondary, the Leaves being grown to a considerable size. That of\r\nProtection is the prime, for which they were originally form’d together\r\nwith the Leaves themselves, and whose service they enjoy in their\r\nInfant-estate: For the _Hairs_ being then in form of a _Down_, alwayes\r\nvery thick set, thus give that protection to the Leaves, which their\r\nexceeding tenderness then requires; so that they seem to be vested with a\r\nCoat of _Frieze_, or to be kept warm, like young and dainty Chickens, in\r\nWooll.\r\n\r\n_Globulets_ are seen upon _Orach_, both Garden and wild; and yet more\r\nplainly on _Mercury_ or _Bonus Henricus_. In these, growing almost upon\r\nthe whole Plant, and being very large, they are by all taken notice of.\r\n\r\nBut strict Observation discovers, that these _Globulets_ are the\r\nnatural and constant Off-spring of very many other Plants. Both these\r\n_Globulets_, and likewise the diversity of _Hairs_, I find the Learned\r\nMr. _Hook_ hath already observed. They are of two kinds; _Transparent_,\r\nas upon the Leaves of _Hysop_, _Mint_, _Baume_, and many more: _White_,\r\nas upon those of _Germander_, _Sage_, and others. All which, though\r\nthe naked Eye will discover, yet by the help of Glasses we may observe\r\nmost distinctly. The use of these we suppose the same with those of the\r\n_Flower_, whereof we shall speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the Flower._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe next proceed to the _Flower_. The general Parts whereof are most\r\ncommonly three; _sc._ the _Empalement_, the _Foliation_, and the _Attire_.\r\n\r\nThe _Empalement_, whether of one or more pieces, I call that which is the\r\nutmost part of the _Flower_, encompassing the other two. ’Tis compounded\r\nof the three general Parts, the _Skin_, the _Cortical_ and _Lignous\r\nBodies_; each _Empaler_ (where there are divers) being as another little\r\nLeaf; as in those of a _Quince-Flower_, as oft as they happen to be\r\novergrown, is well seen. As likewise in the _Primrose_, with the green\r\nFlower, commonly so call’d, though by a mistake; for that which seems to\r\nbe the _Flower_, is only the more flourishing _Empalement_, the _Flower_\r\nit self being white; but the continuation of all the three aforesaid\r\nParts into each _Empaler_, is discoverable, I think, no where better than\r\nin an _Artichoke_, which is a true _Flower_, and whose _Empalers_ are of\r\nthat amplitude, as fairly to shew them all: As also, that the Original of\r\nthe _Skin_ of each _Empaler_ is not distinct from that of the rest; but\r\nto be all one piece, laid in so many Plaits or Duplicatures as there are\r\n_Empalers_, from the outermost to the inner and most central ones.\r\n\r\nThe Design of the _Empalement_, is to be security and Bands to the other\r\ntwo Parts of the _Flower_: To be their security before its opening, by\r\nintercepting all extremities of Weather: Afterwards to be their Bands,\r\nand firmly to contain all their Parts in their due and most decorous\r\nposture; so that a _Flower_ without its _Empalement_, would hang as\r\nuncouth and taudry as a _Lady_ without her _Bodies_.\r\n\r\nHence we have the reason why it is various, and sometimes wanting. Some\r\n_Flowers_ have none, as _Tulips_; for having a fat and firm Leaf, and\r\neach Leaf likewise standing on a broad and strong Basis, they are thus\r\nsufficient to themselves. _Carnations_, on the contrary, have not only an\r\n_Empalement_, but that (for more firmitude) of one piece: For otherwise,\r\nthe foot of each Leaf being very long and slender, most of them would\r\nbe apt to break out of compass; yet is the top of the _Impalement_\r\nindented also; that the Indentments, by being lapp’d over the Leaves\r\nbefore their expansion, may then protect them; and by being spred under\r\nthem afterwards, may better shoulder and prop them up. And if the feet\r\nof the Leaves be both long and very tender too, here the _Empalement_\r\nis numerous, though consisting of several pieces; yet those in divers\r\nRounds, and all with a counterchangeable respect to each other (which\r\nalso the Learned Dr. _Brown_ observes) as in all _Knapweeds_, and other\r\n_Flowers_; whereby, how commodious they are for both the aforesaid ends,\r\nmay easily be conceiv’d; and well enough exemplified by the Scales\r\nof Fishes, whereunto, as to their position, they have not an unapt\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nThe _Foliation_ also, is of the same substantial nature with the green\r\nLeaf; the _Membrane_, _Pulp_, and _Fibres_ whereof, being, as there, so\r\nhere, but the continuation of the _Skin_, the _Cortical_ and _Lignous\r\nBodies_.\r\n\r\nThe Foulds of the _Flower_ or _Foliation_ are various, as those of the\r\ngreen Leaf; but some of them different. The most general are, First,\r\nThe _Plain Couch_, as in _Roses_, and many other double _Flowers_.\r\nthen the _Concave Couch_ as in _Blattaria flore albo_. Next the\r\n_Plait_, as in some of the Leaves of _Pease-Blooms_, in the Flowers of\r\n_Coriander_, &c. which is either single, as in those nam’d; or double,\r\nas in _Blew-Bottle_, _Jacea_, and more of that rank. Next, the _Couch_\r\nand _Plait_ together in the same Flower, as in _Marigolds_, _Daisies_,\r\nand all others of an agreeing form: where the first apparent Fould or\r\nComposture of the Leaves is in _Couch_; but the Leaves being erect, each\r\nlikewise may be seen to lie in a double _Plait_ within it self. Then the\r\n_Rowl_, as in the _Flowers_ of _Ladies-Bower_, the broad top of each\r\nLeaf being by a double _Rowl_ foulded up inwardly. Next, the _Spire_,\r\nwhich it the beginning of a _Rowl_; and may be seen in the Flowers of\r\n_Mallows_, and others. Lastly, the _Plait_ and _Spire_ together, where\r\nthe part analogous to the _Foliation_, is of one piece, the _Plaits_\r\nbeing here laid, and so carried on by Spiral Lines to the top of the\r\n_Flower_, as is in divers, and I think in _Convolvulus Doronici folio_\r\nmore elegantly seen. The reason of all which varieties, a comparative\r\nconsideration of the several parts of the _Flower_ may suggest. Ile only\r\nmention, that no _Flower_ that I find, hath a _Back-Rowl_, as hath the\r\ngreen Leaf, for two Reasons; because its Leaves have not their Fibres\r\nstanding out much on their backside, as the green Leaves have; and\r\nbecause of its Attire, which it ever embosomes, and cannot so well do it\r\nby a _Back-Rowl_.\r\n\r\nThe usual Protections of _Flowers_ by the Precedents are express’d,\r\n_sc._ _Green Leaves_ and _Empalements_. Some have another more peculiar,\r\nthat is a _double Vail_; as the _Spring-Crocus_. For having no\r\n_Empalement_, and starting up early out of the Mould, even before its\r\n_Green Leaves_, and that upon the first opening of the Spring; lest it\r\nshould thus be quite starved, ’tis born swath’d up in a double Blanket,\r\nor with a pair of Sheets upon its Back.\r\n\r\nThe Leaves of divers _Flowers_ at their Basis have an _hairy Tuft_; by\r\nwhich _Tufts_ the Concave of the _Empalement_ is fill’d up; that, being\r\nvery choice and tender, they may thus be kept in a gentle and constant\r\nwarmth, as most convenient for them.\r\n\r\nThe Leaves of the _Flower_, though they are not hairy all over, yet in\r\nsome particular parts they are often set with a fine Downy Velvet; that,\r\nbeing by their shape and posture in those parts contiguous to their\r\ndelicate and tender Attire, they may thus give it a more softly and\r\nwarmer touch. Thus in the Flower of _Ladies Bower_, those parts of its\r\nLeaves which rowl inward, and lie contiguous to the Attire, are Downy;\r\nwhereas the other parts are plain and smooth: So the Flowers of _Pease_,\r\n_Spanish Broom_, _Toad-Flax_, and many others, where contiguous to their\r\nAttires, are deck’d with the like _Hairy Velvet_.\r\n\r\nAs upon the Green Leaves, so upon the Flowers are _Globulets_ sometimes\r\nseen; as upon the backside of that of _Enula_. On none more plainly\r\nthan that kind of _Blattaria_ with the white Flower; where they are all\r\ntransparent, and growing both on the Stalk and Leaves of the _Flower_,\r\neach shewing likewise its _Peduncle_ whereon it is erected.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _Flower_, or the _Foliation_ whereof we now speak, (that\r\nis, as to its private service) is for the protection of the Attire;\r\nthis, as its under, and the _Empalement_ as its upper Garments; as\r\nlikewise of the _Fruit_: The necessity of which Service, in some Cases,\r\nby the different situation of the _Flower_ and _Fruit_, with respect to\r\neach other, is evident; _Apples_, _Pears_, and several other _Fruits_,\r\nstanding behind or under the _Flower_; but _Cherries_, _Apricots_, and\r\ndivers others, within it; for these, being of a very tender and pulpous\r\nBody, and withal putting forth with the colder part of the Spring, could\r\nnot weather it out against the Variations and Extremities of the Air, (as\r\nthose of a more solid _Parenchyma_ can) except lodged up within their\r\n_Flowers_.\r\n\r\nAnd as the _Flower_ is serviceable to the safety of the _Fruit_, so\r\nis it to its growth; _sc._ in its Infancy, or _Embryo_-estate; for\r\nwhich purpose, as there is a Flower, so that Flower is greater or less,\r\naccording as the nature of the Fruit to which it belongs, and the plenty\r\nof the _Sap_ by which the Fruit is fed, doth require. Thus, where the\r\nyoung Fruit is of a solider constitution, and the ascent of the _Sap_\r\nless copious, were there here no _Flower_ to promote the said ascent\r\nthereof into the Fruit (in the manner as is effected by the Green Leaves)\r\nit must needs pine and die, or prove less kindly. On the contrary, should\r\nthe Flower be over-large, it would not only promote the ascent of the\r\n_Sap_ up to the Fruit, but being as yet over-proportionate to it, would\r\nlikewise it self exhaust the same _Sap_, as fast as ascendent; like a\r\ngreedy Nurse, that prepares the Meat for her Child, and then eats it up\r\nher self. Thus we see _Apples_ and _Pears_ with a _Flower_ of a moderate\r\nsize, like their Body; of a middle Constitution, and their _Sap_ of a\r\nmiddle quantity: But _Quinces_, being more solid, besides that they have\r\nas great a _Flower_, the _Impalers_ of their _Flower_ also thrive so\r\nfar as to become handsom Leaves, continuing also after the _Flower_ is\r\nfallen, firm and verdent a great while; so long till the _fruit_ be able\r\nto provide for it self. On the other hand, _Plums_ being more tender\r\nand Sappy than _Apples_ and _Pears_, besides that their _Empalers_ are\r\nmuch alike, their _flower_ is less, and _Gooseberries_ and _Currans_,\r\nwhich are still more Pulpy, and the course of the _Sap_ towards them\r\nmore free, have yet a _flower_ far less. And _Grapes_, whose _Sap_ is\r\nstill of quicker Ascent, have scarce any _flower_ at all; only some small\r\nresemblance thereof, serving just upon the setting of the _fruit_, and no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe _Attire_ I find to be of two kinds, _Seminie_ and _Florie_: That\r\nwhich I call _Seminie_, is made up of two general parts, _Chives_ and\r\n_Semets_, one upon each _Chive_. These _Semets_ have the appearance\r\n(especially in many _flowers_) of so many little _Seeds_; but are quite\r\nanother kind of Body: For upon enquiry we find, that these _Semets_,\r\nthough they seem to be solid, and for some time after their first\r\nformation, are entire; yet are they really hollow; and their side, or\r\nsides, which were at first entire, at length crack asunder: And that\r\nmoreover the Concave of each _Semet_ is not a meer vacuity, but fill’d\r\nup with a number of minute Particles, in form of a Powder; which, though\r\ncommon to all _Semets_, yet in some, and particularly those of a _Tulip_,\r\nbeing larger, is more distinctly observable.\r\n\r\nThese _Semets_ are sometimes fastned so, as to stand erect above their\r\n_Chive_, as those of _Larks-heel_. Sometimes, and I think usually, so\r\nas to hang a little down, in the manner and figure of a _Kidney_; as in\r\n_Mallows_. Their Cleft or Crack is sometimes single, but for the most\r\npart double: At these Clefts it is that they disburse their Powders;\r\nwhich as they start out, and stand betwixt the two Lips of each Cleft,\r\nhave some resemblance to the common Sculpture of a _Pomegranate_ with its\r\nSeeds looking out at the Clefts of its _Rind_: This must be observ’d when\r\nthe Clefts are recently made, which usually is before the expansion of\r\nthe _Flower_.\r\n\r\nThe Particles of these Powders, though like those of Meal or other\r\nDust, they appear not easily to have any regular shape; yet upon strict\r\nobservation, especially with the assistance of an indifferent Glass,\r\nit doth appear, that they are nothing else but a _Congeries_ of so many\r\nperfect _Globes_ or _Globulets_: That which obscures them; is their being\r\nso small. In _Dogs-Mercury_, _Borage_, and very many more Plants, they\r\nare extreamly so. In _Mallows_, and some others, more fairly visible.\r\n\r\nSome of these Powders are yellow, as in _Dogs-Mercury_, _Goats-Rue_,\r\n&c. and some of other colours: But most of them I think are white; and\r\nthose of yellow _Henbane_ very elegant; the disburs’d Powders whereof, to\r\nthe naked eye, are white as Snow; but each _Globulet_, through a Glass,\r\ntransparent as Crystal; which is not a fallacy from the Glass, but what\r\nwe see in all transparent Bodies whatsoever, lying in a Powder or small\r\nParticles together.\r\n\r\nThe _Florid Attire_, is commonly known by the blind and rude Name of\r\n_Thrums_; as in the Flowers of _Marigold_, _Tansie_, &c. How adequate its\r\nimposition is, observation will determine: For the several _Thrums_ or\r\nrather _Suits_, whereof the _Attire_ is made up, however else they may\r\ndiffer in various Flowers, in this agree, that they are ever consistent\r\nof more than one, sometimes of two, and for the most part of three pieces\r\n(for which I call them _Suits_) and each piece of a different, but\r\nagreeable and comely form.\r\n\r\nThe _outer part_ of every _Suit_, is its _Floret_: whose _Body_ or _Tube_\r\nis divided at the top (like that of the _Cowslip_) into divers distinct\r\nLeaves; so that a _Floret_ is the Epitome of a _flower_; and is all the\r\n_flower_ that many Plants, as _Mugwort_, _Tansie_, and others, have. What\r\nthe Learned Dr. _Brown_ observeth of the number Five as to the Leaves of\r\nthe _flower_, is still more universally holding in these of the _Floret_.\r\n\r\nUpon the Expansion of the _Floret_, the next part of the _Suit_ is from\r\nwithin its _Tube_ brought to sight; which we may (with respect to that\r\nwithin it) call the _Sheath_: For this also, like the _Floret_, is a\r\nconcave Body; in its shape very well resembling the Fistulous Pouches of\r\n_Wake-Robin_, or of _Dragon_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sheath_, after some time, dividing at the top, from within its\r\nConcave, the third and innermost part of the _suit_, _sc._ the _Blade_\r\nadvanceth and displayes it self. This part is not hollow, as the other\r\ntwo, but solid; yet at its point, not originally, but after some time, is\r\nevermore divided into two halves.\r\n\r\nUpon the division of the said Point, there appears, as upon the opening\r\nof a _Semet_; a Powder of _Globulets_, which before lay enclosed up\r\nwithin its Clefts; and are of the same nature with those of a _Semet_,\r\nthough not so copious: So that all _flowers_ have their _Powders_ or\r\n_Globulets_. The whole _Attire_ may in _Knapweed_, _Blewbottle_, &c. be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _Attire_, how contemptibly soever we may look upon it,\r\nis certainly great. And though for our own use we value the Leaves of\r\nthe _Flower_, or the _Foliation_, most; yet of all the three Parts, this\r\nin some respects is the choycest, as for whose sake and service the\r\nother two are made. The use hereof, as to Ornament and Distinction, is\r\nunquestionable, but is not all. As for Distinction, though by the help of\r\nGlasses we may make it to extend far; yet in a passant view, which is all\r\nwe usually make, we cannot so well. As for Ornament, and particularly\r\nin reference to the _Semets_, we may ask, If for that meerly these were\r\nmeant, then why should they be so made as to break open, or to contain\r\nany thing within them? Since their Beauty would be as good as if they\r\nwere not hollow, and is better before they crack and burst open, than\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nA farther use hereof therefore we must acknowledge, and may observe; and\r\nthat is for food; for Ornament and Distinction to us, and for Food to\r\nother Animals. I will not say, but that it may serve even to these for\r\nDistinction too, that they may be able to know one Plant from another,\r\nand in their flight or progress settle where they like best; and that\r\ntherefore the varieties of these small parts are many, and well observed\r\nby them, which we take no notice of: Yet the finding out of Food is but\r\nin order to enjoy it: Which, that it is provided for a vast number of\r\nlittle Animals in the _attires_ of all _Flowers_, observation perswades\r\nus to believe. For why else are they evermore here found? Go from one\r\nFlower to another, great and small, you shall meet with none untaken up\r\nwith these Guests. In some, and particularly the _Sun-flower_, where the\r\nparts of the _Attire_, and the _animals_ for which they provide, are\r\nlarger, the matter is more visible. We must not think, that God Almighty\r\nhath left any of the whole Family of his Creatures unprovided for; but as\r\nthe Great Master, some where or other carveth out to all; and that for\r\na great number of these little Folk, He hath stored up their peculiar\r\nprovisions in the _Attires_ of _Flowers_; each _Flower_ thus becoming\r\ntheir Lodging and their Dining-Room, both in one.\r\n\r\nWherein the particular parts of the _Attire_ may be more distinctly\r\nserviceable, this to one Animal, and that to another, I cannot say: Or to\r\nthe same Animal, as a _Bee_, whether this for the _Honey_, another for\r\ntheir _Bread_, a third for the _Wax_: Or whether all only suck from hence\r\nsome _Juice_; or some may not also carry some of the Parts, as of the\r\n_Globulets_, wholly away: Or lastly, what may be the primary and private\r\nuse of the _attire_ (for even this abovesaid; though great, yet is but\r\nsecondary) I now determine not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Fruit._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general composition of all _Fruits_ is one, that is, their\r\n_Essential_ and truly _Vital Parts_, are in all the same, and but the\r\ncontinuation of those which in the other Parts of a _Vegetable_, we\r\nhave already observed: Yet because by the different Constitutions and\r\nTinctures of these Parts, divers considerably different Fruits result; I\r\nshall therefore take a particular view of the more known and principal of\r\nthem, _sc._ _Apples_, _Pears_, _Plums_, _Nuts_ and _Berries_.\r\n\r\nAn _Apple_, if cut traverse, appears constituted of four distinct Parts,\r\nthe _Pill_, the _Parenchyma_, _Branchery_ and _Coare_. The _Pill_ is\r\nonly the spreading and dilatation of the skin, or utmost part of the\r\nBarque in the Branch. The _Parenchyma_, when full ripe, is a tender\r\ndelicate Meat: Yet as the _Pill_ is but the continuation of the utmost\r\npart of the _Barque_; so is this but the continuance and ampliation,\r\nor (as I may call it) the swelth and superbience of the _Inner part_\r\nthereof; which upon observation of a young and Infant-_Apple_ especially,\r\nis evident. Thus we see the _Pith_, which is often tough, in many\r\nRoots, as _Parsneps_, _Turneps_, &c. is tender and edible. So here,\r\nthe _Parenchyma_, though originally no more than the _Barque_, yet the\r\nplenty and purity of its _Sap_ being likewise effectual to the fulness\r\nand fineness of its growth, it thus becomes a soft and tender meat.\r\nThe _Branchery_ is nothing else but the Ramifications of the _Lignous\r\nBody_ throughout all the parts of the _Parenchyma_; the greater Branches\r\nbeing likewise by the _Inosculations_ of the less (as in the Leaf)\r\nunited together. The main Branches are usually fifteen; ten are spred\r\nand distributed through the _Parenchyma_, all enarching themselves\r\ntowards the _Cork_ or _Stool_ of the _Flower_; the other five running\r\nfrom the _Stalk_ in a directer Line, at last meet the former at the said\r\n_Cork_, and are there osculated with them. These five are originated\r\nfrom one; which running along the Center of the _Stalk_, and part of the\r\n_Parenchyma_ of the _Fruit_, is therein at last divided. To these the\r\nCoats of the _Kernels_ are fastned; so that whereas these Branches were\r\noriginally all extended even beyond the _Fruit_, and inserted into the\r\n_Flower_ for the due growth thereof; the _Fruit_ afterwards growing\r\nto some head, and so intercepting and preying upon the Aliment of the\r\n_Flower_, starves that, and therefrom supersedes the service of the said\r\nBranches to it self, ten for its _Parenchyma_, and five for its _Seed_.\r\nThe _Coar_ is originated from the _Pith_; for the _Sap_ finding room\r\nenough in the _Parenchyma_, through which to dispence it self all abroad,\r\nquits the _Pith_, which thereby hardens into a _Coar_. Thus we see the\r\n_Insertions_, although originate from the _Cortical Body_, yet their\r\nParts being, by the _Inosculations_ of the _Lignous_, so much compress’d\r\nand made to co-incide together, they become a Body very compact and\r\ndense. And in the _Barque_ we see the same effect by _arefaction_ only,\r\nor a meer _voydance_ of the _Sap_; the _Inner Part_ whereof, though soft\r\nand sappy, yet its superficial _Rind_ is often so hard and smooth, that\r\nit may be fairly writ upon.\r\n\r\nIn a _Pear_ there are five distinct Parts, the _Pill_, the _Parenchyma_,\r\n_Branchery_, _Calculary_ and _Acetary_. The three former are here and in\r\nan _Apple_ much alike; saving that here the _Inner_ or _Seed-Branches_\r\nare ordinarily ten. The _Calculary_ (most observable in rough-tasted,\r\nor _Choak-Pears_) is a _congeries_ of little stony Knots: They are\r\nmany of them dispersed throughout the whole _Parenchyma_; but lying\r\nmore continuous and compact together towards the Center of the _Pear_,\r\nsurround the _Acetary_ there in a somewhat Globular Form. About the\r\n_Stalk_ they stand more distant; but towards the _Cork_ or _Stool_ of\r\nthe _Flower_, they still grow closer, and there at last gather (almost)\r\ninto the firmitude of a _Plum-stone_ it self. Within this lies the\r\n_Acetary_; ’tis of a soure tast, and by the bounding of the _Calculary_\r\nof a _Globular Figure_. ’Tis a simple Body, having neither any of the\r\n_Lignous_ branched in it, nor any Knots. It is of the same substantial\r\nnature with the _Parenchyma_; but whether it be absolutely one with\r\nit, or be derived immediately from the _Pith_, my Enquiries yet made,\r\ndetermine not.\r\n\r\nThe Original of the _Calculary_ I seem to have neglected: But hereof we\r\nmay here best say, that whereas all the other Parts are Essential and\r\ntruly _Vital_, the _Calculary_ is not; but that the several Knots whereof\r\nit consists, are only so many meer Concretions or Precipitations out of\r\nthe _Sap_; as in _Urines_, _Wines_, and other _Liquors_, we often see.\r\nAnd that this _Precipitation_ is made by the mixture and re-action of\r\nthe Tinctures of the _Lignous_ and _Cortical Bodies_ upon each other:\r\nEven as all _Vegetable Nutrition_ or _Fixation_ of Parts is also made\r\nby the joynt efficiency of the two same Tinctures, as hath been said.\r\nHence we find, that as the _Acetary_ hath no Branches of the _Lignous\r\nBody_, so neither hath it any Knots. Hence likewise it is, that we\r\nhave so different and contrary a taste in the _Parenchyma_ beyond the\r\n_Calculary_, from that in the _Acetary_; for whereas this is soure, that,\r\nwherein the said _Precipitations_ are made, is sweet; being much alike\r\neffect, to what we find in mixing; of _Corals_, &c. with _Vinegar_ or\r\nother _acid Liquor_.\r\n\r\nIn a _Plum_ (to which the _Cherry_, _Apricot_, _Peach_, _Walnut_, &c.\r\nought to be referr’d) there are four distinct Parts, the _Pill_, the\r\n_Parenchyma_, _Branchery_ and _Stone_. The _Pill_ and _Parenchyma_ are,\r\nas to their Original, with those of an _Apple_ or _Pear_ both alike:\r\nAs likewise the _Branchery_, but differently ramified. In _Plums_ (I\r\nsuppose all) there are five main _Out-Branches_, which run along the\r\nSurface of the _Stone_ from the _Basis_ to the point thereof, four\r\nof them by the one Ridge, and one by the other opposite to it. In an\r\n_Apricot_ there is the same number, but the single Branch runs not upon\r\nthe Surface, but through the Body of the _Stone_. There are likewise\r\ntwo or three smaller Branches, which run in like manner under the\r\nother Ridge for some space, and then advancing into the _Parenchyma_,\r\ntherein disperse themselves: These latter sort in _Peaches_ are numerous\r\nthroughout: But notwithstanding the different disposition of the Branches\r\nof the _Fruits_ aforesaid; yet is there one Branch dispos’d in one and\r\nthe same manner in them all: The entrance hereof into the _Stone_ is at\r\nits _Basis_; from whence running through its Body, and still inclining\r\nor arching it self towards its Concave, is at last about its Cone\r\nthereinto emergent, where the Coats of the _Seed_ are appendent to it.\r\nOf the _Seed-Branch_ ’tis therefore observable that after its entrance\r\ninto the _Fruit_, ’tis alwaies prolonged therein to a considerable\r\nlength; as is seen not only in _Apples_, &c. where the _Seed_ stands a\r\ngood distance from the _Stalk_; but in _Plums_ likewise, where it stands\r\nvery near it; in that here the _Seed-Branch_, as is said, never strikes\r\nthrough the _Stone_ into the Coats of the _Seed_ directly, but about\r\nits Cone or remoter end. The _Stone_, though it seem a simple Body, yet\r\nit is compounded of different ones: The Inner Part thereof, as it is by\r\nfar the thinnest, so is it the most dense, white, smooth and simple.\r\nThe Original is from the _Pith_; difficult, but curious to observe: For\r\nthe _Seed-Branch_, not striking directly and immediately quite through\r\nthe _Basis_ of the _Stone_, but in the manner as is above described,\r\ncarries a considerable part of the _Pith_, now gathered round about it,\r\nas its _Parenchyma_, along with it self, which, upon its entrance into\r\nthe concave of the _Stone_ about its farther end, is there in part spred\r\nall over it, as the Lining thereof. The outer and very much thicker Part\r\nconsisteth partly of the like _Precipitations_ or concrete Particles,\r\nas in a _Pear_, being gathered here much more closely, not only to a\r\nContiguity, but a coalition into one entire Stone; as we see in _Pears_\r\nthemselves, especially towards the _Cork_, they gather into the like\r\nStoniness; or as we see a _Stone_, _Mineral_ or _Animal_, oftentimes the\r\nproduct of accumulated _Gravel_: But as the _Parenchyma_ is mixed with\r\nthe Concretion in the _Calculary_, so is it also, though not visibly,\r\nwith these in the _Stone_, the ground of the _Stone_ being indeed a\r\nperfect _Parenchyma_; but by the said Concretions so far alter’d, as to\r\nbecome dry, hard and undistinguishable from them.\r\n\r\nIn a _Nut_ (to which an _Achorn_ is analogous) there are three general\r\nParts, the _Cap_, _Shell_ and _Pith_. The _Cap_ is constituted of a\r\n_Pill_ and _Parenchyma_ derived from the _Barque_, and _Ramulets_ from\r\nthe _Lignous Body_ of the _Branch_. The _Shell_ likewise is not one\r\nsimple Body, but compounded. The Superficial Part thereof is originated\r\nfrom the _Pill_ or _Skin_ of the _Cap_, from the inside whereof it is\r\nin a Duplicature produc’d and spred over the _shell_: which, if you\r\nlook at the _Basis_ of the _shell_, is farther evident; for that being\r\ncontinuous with the _Parenchyma_ of the _Cap_, without the interposure\r\nof the _Skin_, the said superficial Part is there wanting. The thicker\r\nand inner part of the _shell_ consisteth of the same _Parenchyma_ as\r\nthat of the _Cap_, with a _congeries_ of _Precipitations_ filled up, as\r\nin a Stone. And as the _Lignous Body_ is branched in a Stone, so, with\r\nsome difference, in a Shell. The _Outer Branches_ or _Ramulets_ are\r\nnumerous, each issuing out of the _Parenchyma_ of the _cap_, and entring\r\nthe _Shell_ at the Circumference of its _Basis_ and so running betwixt\r\nits superficial and inner parts towards its _cone_, in a Round. The\r\n_Inner_ or _Seed-Branch_ is single, entering in, as do the other, at the\r\n_Basis_ of the _shell_, but at the _center_ thereof; from whence it runs,\r\nnot through the _Shell_, as in _Plums_ through the _Stone_; but through\r\nthe _Pith_, as far as the _cone_, where the Coats of the _Seed_ hang\r\nappendent to it. The _Pith_, whether derived from the same part both in\r\nname and nature in the _Branch_ and _Stalk_, or from the _Cortical Body_,\r\nI yet determine not.\r\n\r\nA _Berry_, as a _Gooseberry_ (to which _Currans_, _Grapes_, _Hipps_, &c.\r\nare to be referr’d) consisteth, besides the _Seed_, of the three general\r\nParts, _Pill_, _Parenchyma_ and _Branchery_: The _Pill_ is originated\r\nas in the foregoing Fruits. The _Parenchyma_ is double, as likewise\r\nin some other _Berries_: The _outer_ is commonly, together with the\r\n_Pill_, call’d the _Skin_, and is that part we spit out, being of a soure\r\ntaste. As the _Pill_ is originated from the _outer_, so this from the\r\n_inner part_ of the _Barque_; and accordingly the Pores thereof may be\r\nobserved plainly of a like shape with those both of the _Cortical Body_\r\nand _Pith_. The _inner_ is of a sweet taste, and is the part we eat: It\r\nis of a constitution so laxe and tender, as it would seem to be only a\r\nthicker or jellied Juice; although this likewise be a true _Parenchyma_,\r\nsomething like that of an _Orange_ or _Limon_, with its Pores all fill’d\r\nup with Liquor. The _Branchery_ is likewise double: The _Exterior_ runs\r\nbetwixt the _Pill_ and outer _Parenchyma_ in arched Lines, from the\r\n_Stalk_ to the _Stool_ of the _Flower_. These outer Branches, though\r\nof various number at the _Stalk_, yet at the _Cork_ are usually ten\r\nprincipal ones; five for the five Leaves of the _Flower_, and five for\r\nthe _Chives_. The inner main Branches are two, diametrically opposite\r\nto each other, and at the _Cork_ with the other inosculated. From these\r\ntwo are branched other smaller, every one having a _Seed_ appendent to\r\nit, whose Coats it entreth by a double Filament, one at the _Basis_,\r\nthe other at the _Cone_. They are all very white and turgent; and by\r\na slaunt cut, may be observ’d concave; thus representing themselves\r\nanalogous to so many true _spermatick Vessels_.\r\n\r\nThe Uses of _Fruits_ are for _Man_, (sometimes also other _Animals_,\r\nas are _Akerns_ and _Haws_) and for the _Seed_. For Man, they are\r\nso variously desirable, that till our Orchards and Store-Chambers,\r\n_Confectioners_ Stores and _Apothecaries_ Shops, our Ladies Closets,\r\ntheir Tables or Hands are empty of them, I shall not need to enquire\r\nfor what. If it be asked, how the Fruit becomes, generally above all\r\nthe other Parts, so pleasant a Meat? It is partly from the _Sap_, the\r\ngrosser portion thereof being deposited in the Leaves, and so the purer\r\nhereunto reserved; partly from the Globular Figure of the Fruit; for the\r\n_Sap_ being thus in a greater quantity herein, and in all parts equally\r\ndiffus’d, the Concoction hereof is with greatest advantage favoured and\r\npromoted. Wherefore all Fruits which we eat raw, how small soever, are of\r\na Globular form, or thereunto approaching; and the nearer, the delicater;\r\namongst _apples_, the _Peppin_; amongst _Pears_, the _Burgundian_; and\r\namongst all Fruits, the _Grape_; and amongst _Grapes_, the roundest, are\r\nof all the most dainty.\r\n\r\nThe visible cause of this Globular Figure, is the _Flower_; or the\r\nInosculation of all the main Branches at the _Stool_ of the _Flower_; and\r\nupon the fall of the _Flower_, the obtuseness, and with Wind and Sun, as\r\nit were the searing of their several ends: For thus the _Sap_ entring\r\nthe _Fruit_, being not able to effect, either a Disunion, or a shooting\r\nforth of the said Branches, and so to carry on their growth in length;\r\nthey must thus of necessity be enarch’d, and with the _Parenchyma_ more\r\nand more expand themselves. Whereas were they dispos’d and qualified\r\notherwise, than as is said, instead of forming a Fruit within bounds,\r\nthey would run out into all extravagance, and even into another little\r\nTree or Leafy growth.\r\n\r\nTo the _Seed_, the _Fruit_ is serviceable; First, in order to its\r\nbeing supply’d with a due and most convenient _Sap_, the greater and\r\nless elaborated part thereof being, in its passage towards the _Seed_,\r\nthereinto received; the _Fruit_ doing the same office to the _Seed_,\r\nwhich the _Leaves_ do to the _Fruit_; the _Sap_ in the _Fruit_ being in a\r\nlaxe comparison, as the _Wine_; and that for the _Seed_, a small part of\r\nthe highest Spirit rectified from it.\r\n\r\nSo likewise for its Protection, in order to the prosperous carrying on\r\nand perfecting of its generation, and security being perfected. Which\r\nprotection it gives not only to the Seminal _Sap_ and _Seed_ it self;\r\nbut alwaies also to its _Seed-Branch_. Thus we see an _Apple_, besides\r\nthat it is it self of ample compass, for the sake of its _Seed_, hath\r\nlikewise its _coar_; as if it were not sufficient, that the Walls of\r\ntheir Room are so very thick, unless also wainscotted. In a _Pear_ again,\r\nwhere the _Parenchyma_ is of less compass than that of an _Apple_, to\r\nwhat protection this affords, that of the _Calculary_ is super-added.\r\nBut in a _Plum_, where the _Parenchyma_ is exceeding tender, and in a\r\n_Peach_, which hangs late, and till Autumn Frosts approach, we have not\r\nonly the Rubbish of a _Calculary_ but stout Stone-Walls. Within which\r\nalso, not only the _Seed_ it self; but the _Seed-Branch_ is evermore\r\nimmur’d. Lastly, in a _Nut_, where the _shell_ being not surrounded with\r\na _Parenchyma_, that protection is wanting without, ’tis answer’d by an\r\nample _Pith_ within it; and the _seed-Branch_ likewise included, not\r\nmeerly in the Body of the Shell, as in a _Plum_, but within the _pith_\r\nit self. So necessary is this design that what the Hen by Incubation\r\nor Hovering, is to the Egg or Chick; that the whole _Fruit_, by\r\ncomprehension, is to the _Seed_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Seed._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Original, so the ultimate end & Perfection of _Vegetation_ is the\r\n_Seed_. How it is the former, and in its state apt for _Vegetation_,\r\nhath already been seen. How the latter, and in its state of Generation,\r\nwe shall now lastly enquire. In doing which, what in the other state\r\nwas either not distinctly existent, or not so apparent, or not so\r\nintelligible, will occur.\r\n\r\nThe two general Parts of the _Seed_ are its _Covers_ and _Body_. The\r\n_Covers_ in this estate are usually four; the outmost we may call\r\nthe _Case_: ’Tis of a very various form; sometimes a _Pouch_, as in\r\n_Nasturtium_, _Cochlearia_; a _Cod_, as in all _Pulse_, _Galega_;\r\nsometimes not entire, but parted, or otherwise open, as in _Sorrel_,\r\n_Knotgrass_, with many other forms; I think alwaies more heterogeneous to\r\nthat of the _Seed_, by which it differs from the proper Coats. To this\r\nthe Caps of _Nuts_, and the _Parenchyma’s_ of Fruits are analogous.\r\n\r\nThe two next are properly the Coats: In a _Bean_ especially, and the\r\nlike; from whence to avoyd Confusion, the denomination may run common\r\nto the responding Covers of other _Seeds_. The Colour of the outer\r\nis of all degrees, from White to the Blackness of _Jett_: Its Figure\r\nsometimes Kidney’d, as in _Alcea_, _Behen_, _Poppy_; triangular, as in\r\n_Polygonatum_, _Sorrel_; triangular spherical, in _Mentha_, _Melissa_;\r\ncircular, in _Leucoium_, _Amaranthus_; globular, in _Napus_, _Asperula_;\r\noval, in _Speculum Veneris_, _Tithymalus_; half Globe, in _Coriander_;\r\nthat which we take for one single round _Seed_, being a Conjugation of\r\ntwo; half Oval, in _Anise_, _Fennel_; Hastal, in _Lactuca_; Cylindrical,\r\nas, if I mistake not, in _Jacobæa_, Pyramidal, in _Geranium_, _Althææ\r\nFol._ with many other differences: But the Perfection of one or two\r\nof the said Figures lieth in the _Case_: So that as all Lines and\r\nProportions are in the _Flower_, so all Regular Figures in the _Seed_, or\r\nrather in its _Covers_.\r\n\r\n’Tis sometimes glistering, as in _Speculum Veneris_; Rough-cast, in\r\n_Catanance_; Studded, in _Behen_, _Blattaria_; Favous, in _Papaver_,\r\n_Antirrhinum_, _Lepidium annuum_, _Alcea Vesicaria_, _Hyosciamus_, and\r\nmany more, before the _Seeds_ have lain long by; Pounced, in _Phalangium\r\nCretæ_, _Lithospermum_; Ramified, in _Pentaphyllum fragiferum_, _Erectum\r\nmajus_, resembling the Fibres of the Ears of the Heart; some just\r\n_Quinquenerval_, as in _Anisum_, and many more, the _Lignous Body_ being\r\nin five main Fibres branched therein.\r\n\r\nThe Covers of not only _Quince_-Seeds, and those of _Psyllium_ (more\r\nusually taken notice of) but those also of _Horminum_, _Nasturtium_,\r\n_Eruca_, _Camelina_, _Ocymum_, and divers others, have a _Mucilage_;\r\nwhich, though it be not visible when the Seeds are throughly dry; yet\r\nlying a while in some warm Liquor, or only on the Tongue, it swells more\r\nor less, and upon them all fairly shews it self. On that of _Ocymum_ it\r\nappears grayish; on the other, transparent; and on that of _Nasturtium\r\nHortense_ very large; even emulous of the inner Pulp surrounding a\r\n_Gooseberry-seed_. The putting of _Clary-seed_ into the Eye, may have\r\nbeen brought into use from this _Mucilage_, by which alone it may become\r\nMedicinal. And thus far of the _Superficies_.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the outer Coat is various, _Membranous_, _Cartilaginous_\r\nand _Stony_; the like _Precipitations_ being sometimes made herein, as in\r\na Stone or Shell; as in that of the Seeds of _Carthamum_, _Lithospermum_,\r\nand others. The Designment hereof, being either with respect to the\r\n_Seed_ in its state of Generation; as where the Case is either wanting,\r\nor at least insufficient of it self, there for its due protection and\r\nwarmth; or, in its state of _Vegetation_, for the better Fermenting of\r\nits Tinctures and _Sap_; the Fermentations of some _Seeds_ not well\r\nproceeding, unless they lie in their Stony Casks in the Mould, like\r\nBottled Liquors in Sand.\r\n\r\nAll _Seeds_ have their outer Covers open; either by a particular\r\n_Foramen_, as in _Beans_, and other _Pulse_, as is said; or by the\r\nbreaking off of the _Seed_ from its _Peduncle_ or _Stool_, as in those\r\nin _Cucumber_, _Cycory_; or by the entering and passage of a _Branch_ or\r\n_Branches_, not only into the Concave thereof near the Cone, but also\r\nthrough the Cone it self; as in _Shells_ and _Stones_.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this _aperture_ it is, that _Akerns_, _Nuts_, _Beans_,\r\n_Cucumbers_, and most other _Seeds_, are in their formation so placed,\r\nthat the _Radicle_ still standeth next to it; that, upon _Vegetation_, it\r\nmay have a free and ready passage into the Mould.\r\n\r\nThe Original of the outer Coat, though from Parts of the same substantial\r\nnature, yet is differently made. In a _Plum_, the _Seed-Branch_ which\r\nruns, as is described, through the Stone, is not naked, but, as is said,\r\ninvested with a thin _Parenchyma_, which it carries from the Stalk along\r\nwith it; and which, by the _Ramification_ of the said _Branch_ within\r\nthe Stone, is in part dilated into a Coat. That of a _Bean_ is from the\r\n_Parenchyma_ of the Cod; the superficial part of which _Parenchyma_, upon\r\nthe large _peduncle_ of the _Bean_ becoming a thin Cuticle, and upon the\r\n_Bean_ it self a _cartilaginous_ Coat.\r\n\r\nThe Original of the inner Coat of the _Bean_ is likewise from the inner\r\npart of the said _parenchyma_; which first is spred into a long Cake, or\r\nthat which with the _seed-Branch_ maketh the _peduncle_ of the _Bean_;\r\nunder which Cake, there is usually a black part or spot; by the length of\r\nwhich, the inner part of the Cake is next inserted into the outer Coat,\r\nand spred all over the Concave thereof.\r\n\r\nThis inner Coat, though when the _Seed_ is grown old and dry, ’tis shrunk\r\nup, and in most Seeds so far as scarcely to be discern’d; yet in its\r\nfirst and juvenile Constitution, is a very Spongy and Sappy Body; and is\r\nthen likewise (as the _Womb_ in a pregnant Animal) in proportion very\r\nthick and bulky; in a _Bean_, even as one of the _Lobes_ it self: And in\r\na _Plum_ or _apricot_, I think I may safely say, half an hundred times\r\nthicker than afterwards, when it is dried and shrunk up; and can scarcely\r\nbe distinguished from the upper Coat. Upon which Accounts it is, in this\r\nestate, a true and fair _Parenchyma_.\r\n\r\nIn this Inner Coat in a _Bean_, the _Lignous Body_ or _Seed-Branch_ is\r\ndistributed: Sometimes, as in _French-Beans_, throughout the whole Coat;\r\nas it is in a Leaf: In the Great _Garden-Bean_, upon its first entrance,\r\nit is bipartite, and so in small Branches runs along the Circumference of\r\nthe Coat, all meeting and making a kind of Reticulation against the Belly\r\nof the _Bean_. In the same manner the main Branches in the outer Coat of\r\na _Kernel_, circling themselves on both hands from the place of their\r\nfirst entrance, at last meet, and mutually inosculate.\r\n\r\nSo that all the Parts of a _Vegetable_, the _Root_, _Trunk_, _Branch_,\r\n_Leaf_, _Flower_, _Fruit_ and _Seed_, are still made up of two\r\nsubstantially different Bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd as every Part hath two, so the whole _Vegetable_ taken together, is a\r\ncomposition of two only, and no more: All properly Woody Parts, Strings\r\nand Fibres, are one Body: All simple _Barques_, _Piths_, _Parenchyma’s_\r\nand _Pulps_, and as to their substantial Nature, _Pills_ and _Skins_\r\nlikewise, all but one Body: the several Parts of a _Vegetable_ all\r\ndiffering from each other, only by the various Proportions and Mixtures,\r\nand variously sized Pores of these two Bodies. What from these two\r\ngeneral Observations might reasonably be inferr’d, I shall not now\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and innermost Cover we may call the _Secondine_; the sight\r\nwhereof, by cutting off the Coats of an _Infant-Bean_, at the Cone\r\nthereof in very thin Slices, and with great Caution, may be obtain’d.\r\nWhile unbroken, ’tis transparent; being torn and taken off, it gathers\r\nup into the likeness of a Jelly, or that we call the _Tredle_ of an Egg,\r\nwhen over-boyl’d. This _Membrane_ in larger or elder _Beans_, is not\r\nto be found distinct; but becomes as it were the Lining of the inner\r\nCoat: But (as far as our Enquiries yet discover) it may in most other\r\n_Seeds_, even full grown, be distinctly seen; as in those of _Cucumber_,\r\n_Colocynthis_, _Burdock_, _Carthamum_, _Gromwel_, _Endive_, _Mallows_,\r\n&c. ’Tis usually so very thin, as in the above-nam’d, as very difficultly\r\nto be discover’d. In some _Kernels_, as of _Apricots_, ’tis very thick;\r\nand in some other Seeds. That all these have the Analogy of one and the\r\nsame Cover, which I call the _Secondine_, is most probably argu’d from\r\ntheir alike Natures; being all of them plain simple _Membranes_, with\r\nnot the least Fibre of the _Lignous Body_ or _Seed Branch_, visibly\r\ndistributed in them; as also from their Contexture, which is in all of\r\nthem more close.\r\n\r\nThe Concave of this _Membrane_ is filled with a most transparent\r\nLiquor, out of which the Seed is formed; as in cutting a _petite_ and\r\n_Infant-Bean_, may be seen; and yet better in a young _Walnut_. In\r\n_Beans_ I have observed it to turn, upon boyling, into a tender white\r\n_coagulum_.\r\n\r\nThrough this _Membrane_, the _Lignous Body_ or _Seed-Branches_\r\ndistributed in the inner Coat, at last shoot downright two slender\r\nFibres, like two Navles, one into each _Lobe_ of the _Bean_. The places\r\nwhere the said Fibres shoot into the _Lobes_, are near the _Basis_ of\r\nthe _Radicle_; and by their Blackishness well enough remark’d: but the\r\nFibres themselves are so very small, as scarcely to be discern’d: Yet in\r\na _Lupine_, of the larger kind, both the places where the Navel-Fibres\r\nshoot into the _Lobes_ (which here from the _Basis_ of the _Radicle_\r\nis more remote) and the Fibres themselves, are fairly visible. For the\r\n_Seed-Branch_, upon its entrance into the Coat of the _Lupine_, is\r\npresently divided into two _main Branches_, and those two into other\r\nless; whereof some underly, others aloft, run along the Coat, and\r\ntowards its other end meet and are inosculated; where about two opposite,\r\nshallow, round, and most minute Cavities, answerable to two Specks of\r\na _cartilaginous_ gloss, one in either _Lobe_, may be observed, which\r\nSpecks are the ends of the said _Navel-Fibres_, upon the ripening of\r\nthe _Seed_ there broken off. These Fibres, from the Superficies of each\r\n_Lobe_, descend a little way directly down; presently, each is divided\r\ninto two Branches, one distributed into the _Lobes_, the other into the\r\n_Radicle_ & _Plume_, in the manner as in the first Chapter is describ’d.\r\nAnd thus far the History. I shall now only with a brief account of\r\nthe _Generation_ of the _Seed_, as hereupon dependent, conclude this\r\nDiscourse.\r\n\r\nLet us say then, that the _Sap_ having in the _Root_, _Trunk_, and\r\n_Leaves_, passed divers Concoctions and Separations, in the manner as\r\nthey are said to be perform’d therein; ’tis now at last, in some good\r\nmaturity, advanced towards the _Seed_.\r\n\r\nThe more copious and cruder part hereof is again seperated by a free\r\nreception into the _Fruit_, or other Part analogous to it: being either\r\nsufficiently ample to contain it, or at least laxe enough for its\r\ntranspiration, and so its due discharge. The more Essential part is\r\ninto the _Seed-Branch_ or Branches entertain’d; which, because they are\r\nevermore of a very considerable length, and of a Constitution very fine,\r\nthe said _Sap_ thus becomes in its Current therein, as in the _Spermatick\r\nVessels_, still more mature.\r\n\r\nIn this mature estate, from the _seed-Branch_ into the Coats of the\r\n_seed_, as into the Womb, ’tis next delivered up. The meaner Part\r\nhereof again, to the outer, as _aliment_ good enough, is supplied.\r\nThe finer part is transmitted to the Inner; which, being, as is said,\r\na _Parenchymous_ and more spatious Body, the _Sap_ therefore is not\r\nherein, as in the outer, a meer _aliment_; but in order to its being, by\r\nFermentation, farther prepared.\r\n\r\nYet the outer Coat, being on the contrary hard and dense; for that\r\nreason, as it admitteth not the Fermentation of the _Sap_ so well within\r\nit self; so doth it the more promote and favour it in the Inner, being\r\nBounds both to it and its _Sap_; and also quickneth the process of the\r\nwhole Work in the formation of the _Seed_.\r\n\r\nNor doth the outer Coat, for the same reason, more promote than declare\r\nthe purity of the _Sap_ now contained in the Inner: For being more hard\r\nand dense, and so not perspirable, must needs suppose the Parts of the\r\n_Sap_ encompassed by it, since thus uncapable of any evacuation, to be\r\ntherefore all, so choice, as not to need it.\r\n\r\nThe _Sap_ being thus prepared in the inner Coat, as a Liquor now apt to\r\nbe the _Substratum_ of the future _Seed-Embrio_, by fresh supplies, is\r\nthence discharged; yet that it may not be over-copious; which, because of\r\nthe laxity of the Inner Coat from whence it issues, it might easily be;\r\ntherefore as the said inner Coat is bounded without by the upper Coat,\r\nso by the _Secondine_ or _Membrane_ is it bounded within; through which\r\n_Membrane_ the _Sap_ being filtr’d, or, as it were, transpiring, the\r\ndepositure hereof, answerable to the _Colliquamentum_ in an Egg, or to\r\nthe _semen Mulibre_, into its Concave at last is made.\r\n\r\nThe other Part of the purest _sap_ embosom’d in the Ramulets of the\r\n_seed-Branch_, runs a Circle, or some progress therein; and so becomes,\r\nas the _Semen Masculinum_, yet more elaborate.\r\n\r\nWherein also, lest its Current should be too copious or precipitate,\r\nby their co-arcture and divarication where they are inosculated, it is\r\nretarded;
