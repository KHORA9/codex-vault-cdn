LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an age of machinery the measure of a people's industrial capacity\r\nseems to be surely fixed by its motive power possibilities. Civilized\r\nnations regard an adequate fuel supply as the very foundation of\r\nnational prosperity--indeed, almost as the very foundation of national\r\npossibility. I am convinced that there will be a reaction against the\r\nintense industrialism of the present, but as it must be agreed that the\r\nrace for industrial supremacy is on between the nations of the world,\r\nAmerica may well take stock of her own power possibilities and concern\r\nherself more actively with their development and wisest use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COAL STRIKE.\r\n\r\nThe coal strike has brought concretely before us the disturbing fact\r\nthat modern society is so involved that we live virtually by unanimous\r\nconsent. Let less than one-half of 1 per cent of our population quit\r\ntheir work of digging coal and we are threatened with the combined\r\nhorrors of pestilence and famine.\r\n\r\nIt did not take many hours after it was realized that the coal miners\r\nwere in earnest for the American imagination to conceive what might be\r\nthe state of the country in perhaps another 30 days. Industries closed,\r\nrailroads stopped, streets dark, food cut off, houses freezing, idle men\r\nby the million hungry and in the dark--this was the picture, and not a\r\nvery pleasant one to contemplate. There was an immediate demand for\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nHow much coal is normally mined in this country?\r\n\r\nBy whom is it mined?\r\n\r\nWhat is its quality?\r\n\r\nTo what uses is it put?\r\n\r\nWho gets it?\r\n\r\nHow much less could be mined if coal were conserved instead of wasted?\r\n\r\nWhat better methods have been developed for using coal than those of\r\nancient custom?\r\n\r\nWho is to blame that so small a supply is on the surface?\r\n\r\nWhy should we live from day to day in so vital a matter as a fuel\r\nsupply?\r\n\r\nWhat substitutes can be found for coal and how quickly may these be made\r\navailable?\r\n\r\nThis is by no means an exhaustive category of the questions which were\r\nput to this department when the strike came. And these came tumbling in\r\nby wire, by mail, by hand, from all parts of the country, mixed with\r\ndisquisitions upon the duty of Government, the rights of individuals as\r\nagainst the rights of society, the need for strength in times of crisis,\r\ncalls for nationalization of the coal industry, for the destruction of\r\nlabor unions, for troops to mine coal, and much else that was more or\r\nless germane to the question before the country.\r\n\r\nMany of these questions we were able to answer. But if coal operators\r\nthemselves had not carried over the statistical machinery developed\r\nduring the war, we would have been forced to the humiliating confession\r\nthat we did not know facts which at the time were of the most vital\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIn a time of stress it is not enough to be able to say that the United\r\nStates contains more than one-half of the known world supply of coal;\r\nthat we, while only 8 per cent of the world's population, produce\r\nannually 46 per cent of all coal that is taken from the ground; that 35\r\nper cent of the railroad traffic is coal; that in less than 100 years we\r\nhave grown in production from 100,000 tons to 700,000,000 tons per\r\nannum; that if last year's coal were used as construction material it\r\nwould build a wall as huge as the Great Wall of China around every\r\nboundary of the United States from Maine to Vancouver, down the Pacific\r\nto San Diego and eastward following the Mexican border and the coast to\r\nMaine again; and that this same coal contains latent power sufficient to\r\nlift this same wall 200 miles high in the air, according to one of our\r\ngreatest engineers (Steinmetz).\r\n\r\nSuch facts are surely startling. They serve to stimulate a certain pride\r\nand give us a great confidence in our industrial future; yet they are\r\nnot as immediately important, when the mines threaten to close, as would\r\nbe a few figures showing how much coal we have in stock piles and where\r\nit is! And months since we called upon Congress to grant the money that\r\nwe might secure these figures, but no notice was taken of the urged\r\nrequests until, late in the summer, a committee of the Senate awoke to\r\nthis need and indorsed our petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL STOCK TAKING.\r\n\r\nThe Government should have a more complete knowledge of the coal and of\r\nother foundation industries than can be found elsewhere, and we should\r\nnot fear national stock taking as a continuing process. It is indeed the\r\nbeginning of wisdom. The war revealed to us how delinquent in this\r\nregard we had been in the past. One day when the full story is told of\r\nthe struggle of the Army engineer to meet war emergency demands, and\r\nthis is supplemented by the tale of the effort made by the Council of\r\nNational Defense and the War Industries Board, it will be realized more\r\nseriously than now how little of stock taking we have done in this\r\ngenerous, optimistic land.\r\n\r\nWhen any such undertaking is proposed, however, it at once appears to\r\narouse the fear that it is somehow the beginning of a malevolent policy\r\ncalled \"conservation,\" and conservation has had a mean meaning to many\r\nears. It connoted stinginess and a provincial thrift, spies in the guise\r\nof Government inspectors, hateful interferences with individual\r\nenterprise and initiative, governmental haltings and cowardices, and all\r\nthe constrictions of an arrogant, narrow, and academic-minded\r\nbureaucracy which can not think largely and feels no responsibility for\r\nnational progress. Needless to say this fear should not, need not be.\r\nThe word should mean helpfulness, not hindrance--helpfulness to all who\r\nwish to use a resource and think in larger terms than that of the\r\ngreatest immediate profit; hindrance only to those who are spendthrift.\r\nA conservation which results in a stalemate as between the forces of\r\nprogress and governmental inertia is criminal, while a conservation that\r\nis based on the fuller, the more essential use of a resource is\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\nTo know what we have and what we can do with it--and what we should not\r\ndo with it, also!--is a policy of wisdom, a policy of lasting progress.\r\nAnd in furtherance of such a policy the first step is to know our\r\nresources--our national wealth in things and in their possibilities; the\r\nsecond step is to know their availability for immediate use; the third\r\nstep is to guard them against waste either through ignorance or\r\nwantonness; and the fourth step is to prolong their life by invention\r\nand discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AS A NATIONAL ASSET.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, perhaps, to indicate how vast are the fields of\r\ncoal which this country holds. It may be that any day some genius will\r\nrelease from nature a power that will make of little value our\r\ncarboniferous deposits save for their chemical content. By the\r\napplication of the sun's rays, or the use of the unceasing motion of\r\nthe waves of the sea, the whole dependence of the world upon coal may be\r\nupset. That day, however, has not yet come; and until it does we may\r\nconsider our coal as the surest insurance which we can have that America\r\ncan meet the severest contest that any industrial rival can present. It\r\nis more than insurance--it is an asset which can bring to us the\r\ncertainty of great wealth, and if we care to exercise it, a mastery over\r\nthe fate and fortunes of other peoples.\r\n\r\nNext to the fertility of our soil, we have no physical asset as valuable\r\nas our coal deposits. Although we are sometimes alarmed because those\r\ndeposits nearest to the industrial centers are rapidly declining and we\r\ncan already see within this century the end of the anthracite field, if\r\nit is made to yield as much continuously as at present, yet it is a safe\r\ngeneralization that we have sufficient coal in the United States to last\r\nour people for centuries to come. An extra scuttleful on the fire or\r\nshovelful in the furnace does not threaten the life of the race, even if\r\nsome Russian or Chinese of the future does not resolve the atom or\r\nharness the hidden forces of the air. Whatever fears other nations may\r\njustifiably have as to their ability to continue in the vast rush of a\r\nmachine world, there can be no question of our ability to last.\r\n\r\nThe present strike, however, makes quite clear, perhaps for the first\r\ntime, that it is not the coal in the mountain that is of value, but that\r\nwhich is in the yard. And between the two there may be a great gulf\r\nfixed. Therefore, we are put to it to make the best of what we have. We\r\nturn from telling how much coal we use to a study of how little we can\r\nlive upon and do the day's work of the Nation. And this is, I believe,\r\nas it should be. Indeed I feel justified in saying that the problem of\r\nthis strike is not to be solved in its deeper significances until we\r\nknow much more about coal than we know now, and this especially as to\r\nthe manner in which it is taken from its bed and brought to our cellars.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY.\r\n\r\nThis transfer is effected by a kind of carrier chain, the links of which\r\nare the operator, the miner, the railroad, and the public. We choose, to\r\nplease ourselves, the link in this chain upon which we place the\r\nresponsibility for its failure to work; but before indulging ourselves\r\nin abuse of arrogant coal barons or dictatorial labor unions, it may lie\r\nas well to ask whether we of the public are not responsible in some part\r\nfor this failure to function. I do not refer now to the failure of\r\nsociety to provide methods of industrial mediation or other adjustment\r\nof such labor difficulties. My question is, whether or not the public is\r\nat all at fault when a nation wealthy beyond all others in coal finds\r\nitself with so small a supply on hand when a strike comes--but a few\r\ndays removed from the gravest troubles. The answer, to my mind, turns\r\nupon the manner in which we have done business.\r\n\r\nWe have been content to go without insurance as to a coal reserve. Each\r\nday has brought its daily supply. There was no thought of railroads\r\nstopping or mines closing down, so that large storage facilities have\r\nnot been provided, and, indeed, we would rebel at paying for our coal\r\nthe added cost of caring for it outside its native warehouse. We have\r\nnot thought in terms of apprehension, but, as always, in the calm\r\ncertainty that the stream of supply would flow without ceasing. In some\r\nway there would be coal into which we could drive our shovels when the\r\nneed was felt.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, therefore, that we are rudely disturbed when one link in the\r\ncarrier chain from coal-in-place to coal-in-the-furnace breaks. It\r\nsimply is one of those things which doesn't happen. And not having\r\nhappened sufficiently often to give us fear, we have had no thought that\r\nwe should provide against it. It is a most heterodox thing to say, but\r\nwe may find that a bit more foresight on the part of the public would\r\ncertainly have made less sudden the present crisis. Let us look, for\r\ninstance, into the matter of the coal miners' year and see if it is not\r\nfixed in some degree by the habit of the public in its purchasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERS' YEAR.\r\n\r\nThe record year, 1918, with everything to stimulate production had an\r\naverage of only 249 working days for the bituminous mines of the\r\ncountry. This average of the country included a minimum among the\r\nprincipal coal-producing States of 204 days for Arkansas and a maximum\r\nof 301 for New Mexico. In such a State as Ohio the average working year\r\nis under 200 days. In 1917 the miners of New Mexico reached an average\r\nof 321 days, and in the largest field, the Raton field, it was actually\r\n336--probably the record for steady operation.\r\n\r\nThis short year in coal-mine operation is due in part to seasonal\r\nfluctuation in demand. The mines averaged only 24 hours a week during\r\nthe spring months. The weekly report of that date showed that 80 per\r\ncent of the lost time was due to \"no market\" and only 15 per cent to\r\n\"labor shortage,\" while \"car shortage\" was a negligible factor. In\r\ncontrast with this should be taken the last week before the strike, when\r\nthe average hours operated were 39 and \"no market\" was a negligible item\r\nin lost time, while \"car shortage\" was by far the largest item. It\r\nfollows that the short year is a source of loss to both operator and\r\nmine worker and is a tax on the consumer.[2]\r\n\r\nWith substantially the same number of mines and miners working this year\r\nas last, the accumulative production for the first 10 months of this\r\nyear is 100,000,000 tons less than that mined in the same period last\r\nyear. This 25 per cent loss in output means that both plant and labor\r\nhave been less productive, and, in terms of capital and labor, coal cost\r\nthe Nation more this year than last. For in the long run both capital\r\nand labor require a living wage.\r\n\r\nThe public must accept responsibility for the coal industry and pay for\r\ncarrying it on the year round. Mine operators and mine workers of\r\nwhatever mines are necessary to meet the needs of the country must be\r\npaid for a year's work. The shorter the working year the less coal is\r\nmined per man and per dollar invested in plant, and eventually the\r\nhigher priced must be the coal. It is obvious that the 264 short tons of\r\ncoal mined by the average British miner last year could not be as cheap\r\nper ton as the 942 tons mined by the average American mine worker,\r\nbacked up as he was with more efficient plant. (A proud contrast!)\r\n\r\nIt would clearly appear that the coal business may be stabilized, not\r\nwholly, but in a very large measure, in some of the western fields,[3]\r\nif the public does not regard its supply of coal as it does its supply\r\nof domestic water, which requires only that the faucet shall be opened\r\nto bring forth a gushing supply. Coal does not have pressure behind it\r\nwhich forces it out of the mine and into the coal yard. It rather must\r\nbe drawn out by the suction of demand. And herein the public must play\r\nits part by keeping that demand as steady and uniform as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVE WE TOO MANY MINES AND MINERS?\r\n\r\nThe problem of the miner and his industry may be stated in another way.\r\nWe consume all the coal we produce. We produce it with labor that upon\r\nsocial and economic grounds works as a rule too few days in the year. We\r\ntherefore must have a longer miners' year and fewer miners or a longer\r\nminers' year and additional markets. One or the other is inevitable\r\nunless we are to carry on the industry as a whole as an emergency\r\nindustry, holding men ready for work when they are not needed in order\r\nthat they may be ready for duty when the need arises. There are too many\r\nmines to keep all the miners employed all of the time or to give them a\r\nreasonable year's work. This conclusion is based on the assumption that\r\nwe now produce only enough coal from all the mines to meet the country's\r\ndemand, which is the fact. More coal produced would not sell more coal,\r\nbut more coal demanded would result in greater coal production. With the\r\nfull demand met by men working two-thirds or less of the time in the\r\nyear there can not be a longer year given to all the miners without more\r\ndemand for coal. This seems to be manifest. Therefore the miners must\r\nremain working but part time as now, or fewer miners must work more\r\ndays, or market must be found for more coal and thus all the miners\r\ngiven a longer year. If we worked all of our miners in all of our mines\r\na reasonable year, we would have a great overproduction. And to have all\r\nour mines work a longer period means that we must find some place in\r\nwhich to sell more coal, either at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nWhy have we so many mines working so many miners? There can be no\r\none-word reply to this question. It penetrates into almost every social\r\nand economic condition of the country--the initiative of capital, the\r\nsize of the country, the pride of localities, the intense competition\r\nbetween railroads, their inability to furnish cars when needed, the\r\nmanner in which cars are apportioned between mines, the manner in which\r\nthe railroads are operated so that movement is slow and equipment is\r\nshort, and this runs into the need for new facilities, such as more\r\nyards, more tracks, more equipment, which brings us into the need for\r\nmore capital and so on and on.\r\n\r\nWe have none too many mines or too many miners to supply our need if the\r\nmines are operated as at present. But we have too many to fill that need\r\nif they are operated on a basis nearer to 100 per cent of possible\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONG VIEW.\r\n\r\nPassing from the labor phase of the coal situation to the larger aspect\r\nof our coal supply as related to the whole problem of the economical\r\nproduction of light, heat, and power, which Sir William Crookes has\r\ncharacterized as \"first among the immediate practical problems of\r\nscience,\" we find ourselves both rich and wasteful, following the\r\nprimrose path, heedless of the morrow and not yet conscious that the\r\nmorrow is to be a day of battle.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we treat coal as if it were a thing which was\r\nexclusively for home use, a nonexportable commodity which must be used\r\n\"on the farm,\" whereas it should be treated with profound respect,\r\nbecause we know from Paris that sacred treaties and national boundaries\r\nturn on its presence. The world wants our coal, envies us for having it,\r\nfears us because of it. It is not only useful to us, but it has a cash\r\nvalue in the markets of the world. Therefore it should be saved.\r\n\r\nIn the next place we treat coal as if it were all alike, not selected by\r\nnature for specific uses; whereas we should choose our coal with as\r\nscientific a judgment as we choose our reading glasses. There is coal\r\nfor coke and coal for furnaces and coal for house use and coal adapted\r\nfor one kind of boiler and a different kind of coal for a different kind\r\nof boiler. Therefore we should discriminate in coal.\r\n\r\nAnd again we have shown little willingness to dignify coal by seeking to\r\ndraw out by improved mechanical processes all the stored content of heat\r\nin this lump of carbon. Instead we content ourselves by giving it a mere\r\npauper touch, driving off the greater volume of its value into the air.\r\nThis is a task for the mechanical engineer.\r\n\r\nThen, too there is the problem of using coal in the form of steam or in\r\nthe more exalted form of electric current. The lifting, bobbing lid of\r\nJames Watt's teakettle did not speak the last word in power. We are only\r\nbeginning to know how we may move on from one form of motive power to\r\nanother. The wastefulness of steam power as contrasted with electric\r\npower is a real challenging problem in conservation by itself.\r\n\r\nAnd then we naturally ask, Why this long haul over mountains and through\r\ntunnels and across bridges and along streets and into houses, by\r\nrailroad, truck, and on the backs of men, when at the very pit mouth, or\r\nwithin the mine itself, this same coal might be transformed into\r\nelectricity and by wire served into factories and homes 100, 200, 300\r\nmiles from the mine? Why burden our congested railroads with this\r\ntraffic? Why strew our streets with this dirt? This may be a practicable\r\nthing, a wise thing; it deserves study if coal is worth conserving.\r\n\r\nAre there no substitutes for coal which we can use and can not export?\r\nThis question immediately raises the water-power possibilities of our\r\nland, of which only the most superficial study has been made. Sell coal\r\nand use electricity would appear a thrifty policy.\r\n\r\nAs petroleum is being used as a substitute for coal--and inasmuch as\r\nthe whole problem of fuel supply is one--we are ultimately compelled to\r\nan investigation of the ability of our petroleum supply to meet its\r\npresent drain and to meet the expansion in its use, which is the most\r\nsurprising development of our day in the study of power creation.\r\n\r\nThis spells a program of development and conservation which should\r\nchallenge the ambitions of this Nation, and on a few of its features\r\nperhaps a few further words would be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING COAL.\r\n\r\nThe two ways by which coal in greatest volume can be saved are the\r\ndiscovery of the method by which more power can be taken from the ton\r\nand the discovery of what kind of coal is best fitted for any particular\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt has been everyone's business to save coal, hence.... The railroads\r\nhave experimented with some success. They get perhaps 10 per cent of the\r\nheat energy from a ton shoveled beneath the locomotive boiler, 10 per\r\ncent of the total in the ton. They use one-quarter of all the coal\r\nmined. Next to labor this is the greatest expense which our railroads\r\nhave. This shows how great the problem is to them. Some have adopted a\r\nsystem of paying a bonus for the greatest distance made on a given\r\nquantity of a given coal. But this laudable effort has not met with the\r\ncooperation that would be expected from the firemen, for reasons that go\r\nfar afield. Industries, especially those which generate electric power,\r\nhave made similar effort to gain from their fuel its greatest\r\npotentiality, and with varying success. We can overlook the stoking of\r\nthe domestic furnace as a national concern, for the amount of coal used\r\nin this way amounts to not more than 17 per cent of the national coal\r\nbill, and this whole charge could be saved, it is estimated, by giving\r\ncare to the 75 per cent of our coal which is burned under boilers to\r\nmake steam. Here there is a maximum figure of 13 per cent of the energy\r\nof the coal put into harness, and the average is less than 10 per cent,\r\neven in the larger plants.\r\n\r\nIn one establishment visited by the fuel engineers of this department\r\nduring the war a preventable waste of 40,000 tons a year was discovered.\r\nBy changes in the admission of air to the furnaces and in the \"baffling\"\r\nof the boilers the engineers of the Bureau of Mines are confident that\r\nthey have been able to increase the economy of coal in the ships of the\r\nEmergency Fleet Corporation by 16 per cent, making 6 pounds of coal do\r\nthe work of 7. If such a percentage of economy could be generally\r\neffected it would mean the saving of as much coal as France and Italy\r\ntogether will need in this year of their greatest distress.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AND COAL.\r\n\r\nThe Government should sample and certify coal. We do this as to wheat\r\nand meat; it is just as necessary to avoid injustice in the case of\r\ncoal, and it is thoroughly practicable. The public should know the kind\r\nof coal it is buying, because it should buy the coal it needs. There\r\nneed be no prohibition against the mining or selling of any coal,[4] but\r\ncoal should sell in terms of its capacity to deliver heat. Some coal\r\nthat is only a pint bottle is selling as a quart bottle. And the quart\r\nis hurt by the competition of the pint. A bill to effect such fuel\r\ninspection has been drafted and will be presented to Congress. It is not\r\na bill commanding anything, but rather gives to those who are willing an\r\nopportunity to have their product inspected and attested and thus\r\nacquire merit in the eye of the world as against those who are not\r\nwilling to subject their coal to the official test tube. Coal is coal in\r\nthe sense of the classic traffic classification. Coal is, however, not\r\nalways coal, nor is it altogether coal when put to the pragmatic test of\r\nthe furnace. If such a bill were passed it would promote the interests\r\nof those who schedule their price upon the merit of their goods and make\r\nagainst the hauling of slate and dirt, its storage and handling under an\r\nassumed name. The plan is not to punish the malefactor who attempts to\r\nimpose upon the public a slender number of thermal units as a ton of\r\ncoal, but rather to give to ever man an opportunity to advertise the\r\nnumber of such units which his particular article contains, thus\r\nenabling the injured public to strike against an unfair mine.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we are to become great exporters of coal, unless all signs\r\nfail, and such certification should be required as to every ton sent\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPANSION ABROAD.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that we have too many mines in operation, as we appear\r\nto have too many miners, if we are to maintain only our present output.\r\nRapid expansion in the development of industry in general may justify\r\nthe existence of such mines and so large a corps of workers, even with\r\nan adequate car supply and more abundant local storage facilities, which\r\nare greatly needed in almost all places, and a more even demand. If,\r\nhowever, this should not be so, there is a foreign demand for the best\r\nof our bituminous coals, which at present we are altogether unable to\r\nmeet for lack of credits on the part of those who wish the coal, and\r\nlack of ships to carry it. England's annual production has fallen\r\n100,000,000 tons, according to Mr. Hoover, and the European demand next\r\nyear will be more than 150,000,000 tons above her production. Whatever\r\nthe world need, it can not be supplied. It is too large for any possible\r\nsupply by ship, even if all necessary financial arrangements could be\r\nmade, either by loan or credit. Europe, indeed, will sadly learn through\r\nthis winter how little coal she can live on and how more than perilous\r\nis the state of a people who are short of power, light, and heat.\r\n\r\nAs this country prior to the war sold abroad no more than 4,500,000 tons\r\nas against England's 77,000,000, it is quite manifest that here will be\r\na new field for American enterprise, the enterprise being needed not for\r\nthe winning of markets as much as for finding ways of dealing with the\r\nlarger phases of a heavy overseas trade with those who are without\r\nimmediate resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING COAL BY SAVING ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nIt is three years since Congress was urged that we should be empowered\r\nto make a study of the power possibilities of the congested industrial\r\npart of the Atlantic seaboard, with a view to developing not only the\r\nfact that there could be effected a great saving in power and a much\r\nlarger actual use secured out of that now produced, but also that new\r\nsupplies could be obtained both from running water and from the\r\nconversion of coal at the mines instead of after a long rail haul. A\r\nstream of power paralleling the Atlantic from Richmond to Boston, a main\r\nchannel into which run many minor feeding streams and from which diverge\r\nan infinite number of small delivering lines--the whole an interlocking\r\nsystem that would take from the coal mine and the railroad a part of\r\ntheir present burden and insure the operation of street lights, street\r\ncars, elevators, and essential industries in the face of railroad\r\ndelinquencies--this is the dream of our engineers, and a very possible\r\ndream it has seemed to me; of such value, indeed, that we might well\r\nspend a few thousand dollars in studying it, not with the thought that\r\nthe Government would construct or operate even the trunk line, but that\r\nit might so attract the attention of the engineering and financial world\r\nas to make it a reality.\r\n\r\nTo tie together the separated power plants of 10 States so that one can\r\ngive aid to the other, so that one can take the place of the other, so\r\nthat all may join their power for good in any great drive that may be\r\nprojected--this would be the prime purpose of the plan; and from this\r\nwould evolve the development of the most practicable method of supplying\r\nthis vast interdependent system with more power--perhaps from the\r\nconversion of coal, as it drops from the very tipple, using the mine as\r\none might use a waterfall, or by the development of great hydroelectric\r\nplants on the many streams from the Androscoggin to the James.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE COAL AND BLACK.\r\n\r\nThis would be a plan for the wedding of the stream and the mine, the\r\nwhite coal with the black. \"White coal\" they call it in imaginative\r\nFrance, this tumbling water which is converted into so many forms; and a\r\nmuch cleaner, handier kind of coal it is than its black brother. And\r\ncheaper, for the water goes on to return again and fall once more and\r\nforever into the pockets of the turbine which whirls the dynamo and so\r\ngathers or releases that mystery which we name but never define.\r\nFarsighted, purposeful Germany fought four and a half years upon the\r\nstrength of great power plants run by the snows of the Alps. She did not\r\nrely on these alone for power, nor were they her main reliance, but they\r\ngave her a lasting power which otherwise she would not have had. And we\r\nmay expect her to improve on that war-time experience for the conduct of\r\nthe hard fight she is to make in the industrial field. France saved\r\nenough territory from the invader to permit her to make new adventures\r\ninto this field and so to some degree offset the coal loss of Lens.\r\nItaly found that she had still left unused opportunities for\r\nhydroelectric development sufficient with the coal she could secure from\r\nEngland and America to see her through the war. And with coal conditions\r\nas they are in Europe we may expect a still greater push to make use of\r\nwater power to turn the industrial wheels of peace. It must be so\r\nlikewise here.\r\n\r\nAnd it is likely that the long-pending power bill which will make\r\navailable the dam and reservoir sites on withdrawn public lands and\r\nmake feasible the financing of many projects on both navigable and\r\nunnavigable streams will soon have become law. We shall then have an\r\nopportunity that never before has been given us to develop the\r\nhydroelectric possibilities of the country. And this raises the question\r\nas to their extent.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical maximum quantity of hydroelectric power that can be\r\nproduced in the United States has recently been estimated by Dr.\r\nSteinmetz, who calculates that if every stream could be fully utilized\r\nthroughout its length at all seasons, the power obtained would be\r\n230,000,000 kilowatts (320,000,000 horsepower). It is clear that only a\r\nfraction of this absolute maximum can ever be made available. The\r\nGeological Survey estimates that the water power in this country that is\r\navailable for ultimate development amounts to 54,000,000 continuous\r\nhorsepower.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1912 showed that the country's developed water power was\r\n4,870,000 horsepower, about 9 per cent of the maximum power available\r\nfor economic development and less than 2 per cent of the total that may\r\nbe supplied by the streams as estimated by Dr. Steinmetz. According to\r\nthe census, stationary prime movers representing a capacity of more than\r\n30,000,000 horsepower, furnished by water, steam, and gas, were in\r\noperation in the United States in 1912. (This amount does not, of\r\ncourse, include power generated by locomotives, marine engines,\r\nautomobiles, and similar mobile apparatus.) The average power furnished\r\nby these stationary prime movers was probably not more than 20 per cent\r\nof their installed capacity, so that the power produced in 1912 was\r\nequivalent to probably not more than 6,000,000 continuous horsepower.\r\n\r\nAs the estimated available water power given above represents continuous\r\npower the country evidently possesses much more water power than it now\r\nrequires, so that there would be an ample surplus for many years if the\r\npower were so distributed geographically that it could be economically\r\nsupplied to the industries that need it. But as a matter of fact the\r\nwater-power resources of the country are by no means evenly distributed.\r\nOver 70 per cent of the available water power is west of the\r\nMississippi, whereas over 70 per cent of the total horsepower now\r\ninstalled in prime movers is east of the river. Therefore unless the\r\nEast is to lose its industrial supremacy it must press and press hard\r\nfor the development of all water-power possibilities!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF PETROLEUM.\r\n\r\nFor a full century now we have been passing through different phases of\r\nindustrial and commercial life which have been characterized by some\r\nform of power. First the age of steam, and then the age of electricity.\r\nWe have passed out of neither and yet we have come into another\r\nage--that of petroleum. As a lubricant, it has become of such universal\r\nuse that it has been called the barometer of industry, and no doubt\r\nafter it has ceased to be a popular illuminant or a source of power it\r\nwill live invaluable as the thing which lets the wheels go round. Its\r\ngreatest popularity now arises out of its use in the internal-combustion\r\nengine, and of the making of these there is no end. It draws railroad\r\ntrains and drives street cars. It pumps water, lifts heavy loads, has\r\ntaken the place of millions of horses, and in 20 years has become a\r\nfarming, industrial, business, and social necessity. The naval and the\r\nmerchant ships of this country and of England are fitted and being\r\nfitted to use it either under steam boilers as fuel or directly in the\r\nDiesel engine. The airplane has been made possible by it. It propels\r\nthat modern juggernaut, the tank. In the air it has no rival, while on\r\nland and sea it threatens the supremacy of its rivals whenever it\r\nappears. There has been no such magician since the day of Aladdin as\r\nthis drop of mineral oil. Medicines and dyes and high explosives are\r\ndistilled from it. No one knows whence it cometh or whither it goeth.\r\nMen search for it with the passion of the early Argonauts, and the\r\npromise now is that nations will yet fight to gain the fitful bed in\r\nwhich it lies.\r\n\r\nIn Persia and in Palestine, in Java and in China, in southern Russia and\r\nin Rumania we know that petroleum is, for it has been found there. How\r\ngreat these fields or others in Europe, Asia, or Africa may be no one\r\nwould dare to say. As yet, however, the petroleum of the world has come\r\nfrom this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe \"oil spring\" which George Washington found in western Virginia and\r\nby his last will called to the especial consideration of his trustees\r\nwas the promise of a continental well which last year yielded\r\n356,000,000 barrels. Each year has seen the prophecy unfulfilled that\r\nthe peak of the possible yield had been reached.\r\n\r\nFrom the mountains of western Pennsylvania into the very ocean bed of\r\nthe Pacific and even beyond and into the broken strata of upturned\r\nAlaska, the oil prospector bored with his sharp tooth of steel and found\r\noil. Hardly has one field fallen into a decline when another has come\r\nrushing into service. Only three years ago and all hopes were centered\r\nin Oklahoma, and then came Kansas, and then the turn went south again to\r\nTexas, and now it looks toward Louisiana. Geologists have estimated and\r\nestimated, and they do not differ widely, for few give more than thirty\r\nyears of life to the petroleum sands of this country if the present\r\nyield is insisted upon. And yet there is so much of mystery in the\r\nhiding of this strange subterranean liquid that honest men will not say\r\nbut that it will become a permanent factor in the world of light, heat,\r\nand power. If this is not so we are a fatuous people, for with every\r\nfifth man in the country the owner of an automobile and the expenditure\r\nof hundreds of millions of dollars for roads fit only for their use, and\r\nwith ships by the hundred specially constructed to burn oil, we have\r\nsurely given a large fortune in pledge of our faith that our pools of\r\npetroleum will not soon be drained dry, or that others elsewhere will\r\ncome to our help.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the country's production of oil was 178,500,000 barrels, and\r\nthere was a surplus above consumption of more than 20,000,000 barrels\r\navailable to go into storage. In 1918, 10 years later, the oil wells of\r\nthe United States yielded 356,000,000 barrels--nearly twice the yield of\r\n1908--but to meet the demands of the increased consumption more than\r\n24,000,000 barrels had to be drawn from storage. The annual fuel-oil\r\nconsumption of the railroads alone has increased from 16-2/3 to 36-3/4\r\nmillion barrels; the annual gasoline production from 540,000,000 gallons\r\nin 1909 to 3,500,000,000 gallons in 1918. This reference to the record\r\nof the past may be taken not only as justifying the earlier appeal for\r\nFederal action, but as warranting deliberate attention to the oil\r\nproblem of to-day.\r\n\r\nFuel oil, gasoline, lubricating oil--for these three essentials are\r\nthere no practical substitutes or other adequate sources? The obvious\r\nanswer is in terms of cost; the real answer is in terms of man power.\r\nWhether on land or sea, fuel oil is preferred to coal because it\r\nrequires fewer firemen, and back of that, in the man power required in\r\nits mining, preparation, and transportation the advantage on the side of\r\noil is even greater. So, too, the substitute for gasoline in\r\ninternal-combustion engines, whether alcohol or benzol, means higher\r\ncost and larger expenditure of labor in its production.\r\n\r\nThere are large bodies of public land now withdrawn, which, under the\r\nnew leasing bill which seems so near to final passage after seven years\r\nof struggle and baffled hope, will in all likelihood make a further rich\r\ncontribution to the American supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL SHALE.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond these in point of time lie the vast deposits of oil shale\r\nwhich by a comparatively cheap refining process can be made to yield\r\nvastly more oil than has yet been found in pools or sands. The value of\r\nthis oil shale will depend upon the cheapness of its reduction, and this\r\nmust be greatly lessened by the value of by-products before it can\r\ncompete with coal or the oil from wells. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve, however, that some day the production of oil from shale will be\r\na great and a permanent industry. And the country could make no better\r\nimmediate investment than to give a large appropriation for the\r\ndevelopment of an economical shale-reducing plant.\r\n\r\nSo conservative an authority as the Geological Survey estimates that\r\nthe oil shales of the Western States alone contain many times over the\r\nquantity of oil that will be recovered from our oil wells. The retorting\r\nof oil from oil shale has been a commercial industry for many years in\r\nScotland and France; in fact, oil was obtained from oil shale here in\r\nthe United States before the first oil well was drilled. The industry is\r\nin process of redevelopment to-day and if successful will assure us of a\r\nfuture supply, but at the best it will take years of time and a vast\r\ninvestment of capital to build up the industry to such a point that it\r\ncan supply any considerable proportion of our needs. It is imperative,\r\nhowever, that the development of this latent resource be furthered and\r\nbrought to a state of commercial development as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVE OIL.\r\n\r\nYet with all the optimism that can be justified I would urge a policy of\r\nsaving as to petroleum that should be rigid in the extreme. If we are to\r\nlong enjoy the benefits of a petroleum age, which we must frankly admit\r\nfits into the comfort-loving and the speed-loving side of the American\r\nnature, we must save this oil.\r\n\r\nWe must save it before it leaves the well; keep it from being lost; keep\r\nit from being flooded out, driven away by water. Through the cementing\r\nof wells in the Cushing field, Oklahoma, the daily volume of water\r\nlifted from the wells was decreased from 7,520 barrels to 628 barrels,\r\nwhile the daily volume of oil produced was increased from 412 barrels to\r\n4,716. These instances show what can and should be done in our known oil\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nWe must save the oil after it leaves the well, save it from draining off\r\nand sinking into the soil, save it from leaking away at pipe joinings,\r\nsave it from the wastes of imperfect storage.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the refining of the oil. How welcome now would be the\r\nknowledge that we could recover what was thrown away when kerosene was\r\npetroleum's one great fraction. (The loss in refineries is still\r\nstartling, some 14,556,000 barrels last year--4-1/2 per cent of the\r\ncrude run in the refineries.)\r\n\r\nThe self-interest of the American refiner, notably the Standard Oil Co.,\r\nhas done a work that probably no mere scientific or noncommercial\r\nimpulse could have equaled, in torturing out of petroleum the secrets of\r\nits inmost nature. And yet the thought will not altogether give place\r\nthat in that residue which goes to the making of roads or to be burned\r\nin some crude way there may be things chemical that will work largely\r\nfor man's betterment. This is the fact, too--that where the oil is\r\nproduced by some small companies which have not the financial ability to\r\nmake it yield its full riches there is a greater danger of loss of this\r\nkind. It would be well indeed if there could be such regulation as\r\nwould require that all petroleum must be refined. That this is done\r\ngenerally is not denied. It should be universal. And all the skill and\r\nstudy and knowledge of the ablest of chemists and mechanicians should\r\nfind themselves challenged by the problem of petroleum.\r\n\r\nComing to the use of petroleum in its various forms we find a field of\r\npromise. The engine that doubles the number of miles that can be made on\r\na gallon of gasoline doubles our supply. There is where we can apply the\r\nprinciple of true conservation--find how little you need; use what you\r\nmust, but treat your resource with respect. Has the last word been said\r\nas to the carburetor? Mechanical engineers do not think so. Have all\r\npossible mixtures which will save oil and substitute cheaper and less\r\nrare combustibles therefor been tried? Men by the hundred are making\r\nthese experiments, and almost daily the quack or the stock promoter\r\ncomes forward with the announcement of a discovery which proves to be a\r\nrevelation--a revelation of human stupidity or criminal cupidity. On\r\nthis line the men of science do not sing a song of the richest hope;\r\nthey shrug their shoulders, exclaiming with uplifted hands: \"Well, may\r\nbe, may be.\"\r\n\r\nThere are possible substitutes for some petroleum products, but not for\r\nthe whole barrel of oil; furthermore, petroleum is the cheapest\r\nmaterial, speaking quantitatively, from which liquid fuels and\r\nlubricants can be made; therefore, any substitutes obtained in quantity\r\nmust cost more. Alcohol can be substituted for gasoline, but only in\r\nlimited quantity and at increased cost. Benzol from byproduct coking\r\novens also can be used, but quantitatively is totally inadequate. For\r\nkerosene no quantitative substitute is known. Lubricants can be obtained\r\nfrom animal and vegetable fats, but mostly are inferior in quality, and\r\nthere seems no hope of obtaining them in quantity. Fuel oil can be\r\nlargely supplanted by coal, but for the internal-combustion engine there\r\nis no quantitative substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE THE DIESEL ENGINE.\r\n\r\nWe have ventured on a great shipbuilding program. Our people are to once\r\nagain respond to the call of the sea. On private ways and on Government\r\nways ships are being built to go round the world--ships that are to burn\r\noil under boilers and produce steam. I presume that there is a\r\njustification for this policy, perhaps one that is as good, if not\r\nbetter, than can be made for the railroads of the West pursuing the same\r\npolicy. I submit, however, that there should be justification shown for\r\nthe construction of any oil-burning ship which does not use an engine of\r\nthe Diesel type. To burn oil under a boiler and convert it into steam\r\nreleases but 10 per cent of the thermal units in the oil, whereas if\r\nthis same fuel oil were used directly in a Diesel engine, 30 to 35 per\r\ncent of the power in the oil would be secured. Substitute the\r\ninternal-combustion engine for the steam boiler and we multiply by three\r\nor three and one-half the supply of fuel oil in the United States.\r\nInstead of our fuel-oil supply being, let us say, 200,000,000 barrels,\r\nit would at once rise to 600,000,000 barrels or 700,000,000. I recognize\r\nthat this is an impractical and unrealizable hope as applied to things\r\nas they are, but there is no reason why this should not be a very\r\ndefinite policy as to things that are to be.\r\n\r\nThis Government might itself well undertake to develop an engine of this\r\ntype for use on its ships, tractors, and trucks. We simply can not\r\nafford to preach economy in oil when we do not promote by every means\r\nthe use of the internal-combustion engine for its consumption. No other\r\none thing that can be done by the Government, our industries, or the\r\npeople will save as much oil from being wasted and thereby multiply the\r\nreal production of the United States. If such engines are delicate of\r\nhandling and need specially trained engineers, which appears to be the\r\nfact, there should be little difficulty experienced in training men for\r\nsuch work. A nation that could educate 10,000 automobile mechanics in 60\r\ndays might indeed develop 1,000 Diesel engineers in a year. The matter\r\nis of too great moment for delay. It touches the interest of everyone.\r\nWe are in the petroleum age, and how long it will last depends upon our\r\nown foresight, inventiveness, and wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED--A FOREIGN SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nAlready we are importers of petroleum. We are to be larger importers\r\nyear by year if we continue--and we will--to invent and build machines\r\nwhich will rely upon oil or its derivatives as fuel. Our business\r\nmethods have been and doubtless will continue to be developed along\r\nlines that make a continuing oil supply a necessity. Some of that oil\r\nmust come from abroad, as nearly 40,000,000 barrels did last year, and\r\nfor that we must compete with the world. For while we are the\r\ndiscoverers of oil and of the methods of securing it and refining it,\r\npiping it, and using it, our pioneering is but a service unto the world.\r\n\r\nThis situation calls for a policy prompt, determined, and looking many\r\nyears ahead. For the American Navy and the American merchant marine and\r\nAmerican trade abroad must depend to some extent upon our being able to\r\nsecure, not merely for to-day but for to-morrow as well, an equal\r\nopportunity with other nations to gain a petroleum supply from the\r\nfields of the world. We are now in the world and of it in every possible\r\nsense, otherwise our Navy and our merchant fleet would have no excuse.\r\nNo one needs to justify them--they are the expression of an ambition\r\nthat carries no danger to any people. For their support we can ask no\r\npreference, but in their maintenance we can insist that they shall not\r\nbe discriminated against.\r\n\r\nSometime since I presented to a board of geologists, engineers, and\r\neconomists in this department this question:\r\n\r\n     If in the next five years there should develop a new demand for\r\n     petroleum over and above that now existing, which would amount to\r\n     100,000,000 barrels a year, where could such a supply be found, and\r\n     what policy should be adopted to secure it?\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of this board may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n     (1) Such an oil need could not be met from domestic sources of\r\n     supply.\r\n\r\n     (2) It could not be assured unless equal opportunities were given\r\n     our nationals for commercial development of foreign oils.\r\n\r\n     (3) Assurance of this oil supply therefore inevitably entails\r\n     political as well as commercial competition with other nationals,\r\n     as other nationals controlling foreign sources of supply have\r\n     adopted policies that discriminate against, hinder, and even\r\n     prevent our nationals entering foreign fields.\r\n\r\n     (4) The encouragement of and effective assistance to our nationals\r\n     in developing foreign fields is essential to securing the oil\r\n     needed.\r\n\r\n     (5) Commercial control by our nationals over large foreign sources\r\n     of supply will be essential if the estimated requirements are to be\r\n     assured.\r\n\r\n     (6) It is necessary that all countries be induced to abandon or\r\n     adequately modify present discriminatory policies and that the\r\n     interest of our nationals be protected.\r\n\r\n     (7) Some form of world-wide oil-producing, purchasing, and\r\n     marketing agency fostered by this Government seems essential to\r\n     assure the commercial control over sufficient resources to meet the\r\n     competition of other nationals. England has apparently adopted such\r\n     a policy.\r\n\r\nThis board proposed the following program of action:\r\n\r\n     (1) To secure the removal of all discriminations to the end that\r\n     our nationals may enjoy in other countries all the privileges now\r\n     enjoyed by other nationals in ours:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) By appropriate diplomatic and trade measures.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) By securing equal rights to our nationals in countries newly\r\n     organized as mandatories.\r\n\r\n     (2) To encourage our nationals to acquire, develop, and market oil\r\n     in foreign countries:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) By assured adequate protection of our citizens engaged in\r\n     securing and developing foreign oil fields.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) By promotion of syndication of our nationals engaged in\r\n     foreign business, in order to effectually conduct oil development\r\n     and distribution of petroleum and its products abroad.\r\n\r\n     (3) Governmental action--through special agency or board:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Through the organization of a subsidiary governmental\r\n     corporation with power to produce, purchase, refine, transport,\r\n     store, and market oil and oil products.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Through the formation of a permanent petroleum\r\n     administration.\r\n\r\n     (4) To assure to our nationals the exclusive opportunity to\r\n     explore, develop, and market the oil resources of the Philippine\r\n     Islands, provided discriminatory policies of other nations against\r\n     our nationals are not abandoned or satisfactorily modified.\r\n\r\nI have given much thought during the past year to this problem of adding\r\nto our petroleum supply, and it has seemed to me but fair that we\r\nshould first make every effort to increase the domestic supply through\r\nthe methods that have been indicated--\r\n\r\n(1) The saving of that which is now wasted, below ground and above\r\nground.\r\n\r\n(2) The more intensive use, through new machinery and devices, of the\r\nsupply which we have.\r\n\r\n(3) The development of oil fields on our withdrawn territory and in new\r\nareas such as the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we must look abroad for a supplemental supply, and this may\r\nbe secured through American enterprise if we do these things:\r\n\r\n(1) Assure American capital that if it goes into a foreign country and\r\nsecures the right to drill for oil on a legal and fair basis (all of\r\nwhich must be shown to the State Department) it will be protected\r\nagainst confiscation or discrimination. This should be a known,\r\npublished policy.\r\n\r\n(2) Require every American corporation producing oil in a foreign\r\ncountry to take out a Federal charter for such enterprise under which\r\nwhatever oil it produces should be subject to a preferential right on\r\nthe part of this Government to take all of its supply or a percentage\r\nthereof at any time on payment of the market price.\r\n\r\n(3) Sell no oil to a vessel carrying a charter from any foreign\r\ngovernment either at an American port or at any American bunker when\r\nthat government does not sell oil at a nondiscriminatory price to our\r\nvessels at its bunkers or ports.\r\n\r\nThe oil industry is more distinctively American than any other of the\r\ngreat basic industries. It has been the creation of no one class or\r\ngroup but of many men of many kinds--the hardy, keen-eyed prospector\r\nwith a \"nose for oil\" who spent his months upon the deserts and in the\r\nmountains searching for seepages and tracing them to their source; the\r\nrough and two-fisted driller, a man generally of unusual physical\r\nstrength, who handled the great tools of his trade; the venturesome\r\n\"wildcatter,\" part prospector, part promoter, part operator, the\r\n\"marine\" of the industry, \"soldier and sailor too\"; the geologist who\r\nthrough his study of the anatomy of the earth crust could map the pools\r\nand sands almost as if he saw them; the inventor; the chemist with still\r\nand furnace; the genius who found that oil would run in a pipe--these\r\nand many more, in most of the sciences and in nearly all of the crafts,\r\nhave created this American industry. If they are permitted they will\r\nreveal the world supply of oil. And upon that supply the industries of\r\nour country will come to be increasingly dependent year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY WAY OF SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be our plain duty to discover how little oil we need to\r\nuse. To do this we must dignify coal by grading it in terms not merely\r\nof convenience as to size, but in terms of service as to its power. We\r\nshould save it, if for no better reason than that we may sell it to a\r\ncoal-hungry world. We should develop water power as an inexhaustible\r\nsubstitute for coal and if necessary compel the coordination of all\r\npower plants which serve a common territory. New petroleum supplies have\r\nbecome a national necessity, so quickly have we adapted ourselves to\r\nthis new fuel and so extravagantly have we given ourselves over to its\r\nadaptability. To save that we may use abundantly, to develop that we may\r\nnever be weak, to bring together into greater effectiveness all power\r\npossibilities--these would seem to be national duties, dictated by a\r\nlarge self-interest.\r\n\r\nI have gone only sufficiently far into this whole question to realize\r\nthat it is as fundamental and of as deep public concern as the railroad\r\nquestion and that it is even more complex. No one, so far as I can\r\nlearn, has mastered all of its various phases; in fact, there are few\r\nwho know even one sector of the great battle front of power. A Foch is\r\nneeded, one in whom would center a knowledge of all the activities and\r\nthe inactivities of these three great industries, which in reality are\r\nbut a single industry. We should know more than we do, far more about\r\nthe ways and means by which our unequaled wealth in all three divisions\r\ncan be used and made interdependent, and the moral and the legal\r\nstrength of the Nation should be behind a studied, fact-based,\r\nlong-viewed plan to make America the home of the cheapest and the most\r\nabundant and the most immediately and intimately serviceable power\r\nsupply in the world. If we do this, we can release labor and lighten\r\nnearly every task. We will not need to send the call to other countries\r\nfor men, and we can distribute our industries in parts of the country\r\nwhere labor is less abundant and where homes will take the place of\r\ntenements. One could expand upon the benefits that would come to this\r\nland if a rounded program such as has been but skeletonized here could\r\nbe carried out. I am convinced that within a generation it will be\r\neffected, because it will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe simple steps now obviously needed are to pass those primary bills\r\nwhich are already before Congress or are here suggested. But beyond this\r\nthere is imperative need that some one man (an assistant secretary in\r\nthis department would serve)--some one man with a competent staff and\r\ncommanding all the resources of this and other departments of the\r\nGovernment shall be given the task of taking a world view as well as a\r\nnational view of this whole involved and growing problem, that he may\r\nrecommend policies and induce activities and promote cooperative\r\nrelationships which will effect the most economical production of light,\r\nheat, and power, which is more than the first among the immediate\r\npractical problems of science, as Sir William Crookes said, for it is\r\nforemost among the immediate practical problems of national and\r\ninternational statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nI wish now to ask consideration for another matter of home concern to\r\nwhich I gave attention in my last report and as to which the intervening\r\nyear has strengthened and perhaps broadened my ideas--the development of\r\nour unused lands.\r\n\r\nIt was never more vital to the welfare of our people that a creative and\r\nout-reaching plan of developing and utilizing our natural resources\r\nshould go bravely forward than it is to-day. Ours is a growing country,\r\nand as its social and industrial superstructure expands its agricultural\r\nfoundation must be broadened in proportion. The normal growth of the\r\nUnited States now requires an addition of 6,300,000 acres to its\r\ncultivable area each year, which means an average increase of 17,000\r\nacres a day.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the opportunity for this essential expansion exists not\r\nonly in the West, where much of the public domain is yet unoccupied, but\r\nin every part of the Republic. We have a great fund of natural resources\r\nin the very oldest States, from Maine to Louisiana, which invite and\r\nwould richly reward the constructive genius of the Nation. It is claimed\r\nby those who have specialized for years on the subject of reclamation\r\nthat the control and utilization of flood waters now wasted would\r\nproduce within the next 10 years more wealth than the entire cost to the\r\nUnited States of the war with Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter every other war in our history the work of internal development\r\nhas gone forward by leaps and bounds, and our people have thus quickly\r\nmade good the economic wastes of the conflict. The needs of to-day are\r\ndifferent from those of the past and require different treatment, but\r\nthey are by no means beyond the reach of enlightened thought and action.\r\n\r\nMore than a year ago we began an earnest discussion of reconstruction\r\npolicies, particularly with respect to the land. But nothing has been\r\ndone. Not one line of legislation, not one dollar of money has been\r\nprovided except in the way of preliminary investigation. We stand\r\nvoiceless in the presence of opportunity and idle in the face of urgent\r\nnational need.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROGRAM OF PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nThe great work of material development accomplished in the past has been\r\ndone very largely by private capital and enterprise. Doubtless this must\r\nbe the chief reliance for progress in the future. We should realize,\r\nhowever, that this method has involved losses as well as gains, for the\r\nNation has sometimes been too prodigal in offering its natural resources\r\nas an inducement to private effort. Not only so, but with the exhaustion\r\nof the free public lands in our great central valleys--the most\r\nremarkable natural heritage that ever fell into the lap of a young\r\nnation--conditions of home making and settlement have radically changed.\r\n\r\nThere can be do doubt that there is an important sphere of action which\r\nthe Government must occupy if we are to go steadily forward with the\r\nwork of continental conquest, and all it implies to the future of the\r\nNation, but in suggesting practicable steps of progress at this time I\r\ndo not forget the burden of taxation which confronts our people nor the\r\ndelicate and difficult task which Congress is called upon to perform in\r\ntrying to keep the national outgo within the national income. Hence, I\r\nam now suggesting such constructive things as the Government may be able\r\nto do through the exercise of its powers of supervision and direction\r\nand with the smallest possible outlay of money.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I put, first, the matter of suburban homes for wage\r\nearners; second, reclamation of desert, overflow, and cut-over areas,\r\ntogether with improvement of abandoned farms, under a system of district\r\norganization which may be made to finance itself; third, cooperation\r\nwith various States in the work of internal development.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HOMES FOR THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nThere is no more baffling problem than that presented by the continued\r\ngrowth of great cities, but it is a problem with which we must sometime\r\ndeal. It bears directly on the high cost of living and is, indeed,\r\nlargely responsible for it. Rent is based on land values. Land values\r\nrise with increasing population. The price of food is closely related to\r\nthe growing disproportion between consumers and producers, resulting\r\nfrom urban congestion.\r\n\r\nHere is Washington, a city of some 400,000 people, doubtless destined\r\nsteadily to grow until--a Member of Congress predicts--it may touch\r\n2,000,000 twenty years hence. Already the housing problem is acute, as\r\nit is in almost every other large American city. It would be a pitiful\r\nthing if the provision of more housing facilities to meet the needs of\r\ngrowing population meant merely more congestion and higher rents, with\r\nan ever-decreasing degree of landed proprietorship and true individual\r\nindependence. Such conditions, it seems to me, undermine the American\r\nhearthstone and carry a deep menace to the future of our institutions. I\r\nbelieve there must be a better way, and that the time has come when we\r\nshould make an earnest effort to find it.\r\n\r\nWithin a 10-mile circle drawn around the Capitol dome are thousands of\r\nacres of good agricultural land, of which the merest fraction has been\r\nreduced to intensive cultivation. Much of it is wastefully used, and\r\nmuch of it is not used at all. Conditions of soil, climate, and water\r\nsupply are good and represent a fair average for the United States.\r\nSuburban transportation is a serious problem in some localities and less\r\nso in others, but tends to become more simple with the extension of good\r\nroads and increasing use of motor vehicles, including the auto bus.\r\n\r\nSomewhere and sometime, it seems to me, a new system must be devised to\r\ndisperse the people of great cities on the vacant lands surrounding\r\nthem, to give the masses a real hold upon the soil, and to replace the\r\napartment house with the home in a garden. Such a system should enable\r\nthe ambitious and thrifty family not only to save the entire cost of\r\nrent, but possibly half the cost of food, while at the same time\r\nenhancing its standard of living socially and spiritually, as well as\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that there is no better place to demonstrate a new\r\nform of suburban life than here at the National Capital, where we may\r\nfreely draw upon all the resources of the governmental departments for\r\nexpert knowledge and advice and where the demonstration can readily\r\ncommand wide publicity and come under the observation of the Nation's\r\nlawmakers. And I am expecting that this experiment will be made. Such a\r\nplan of town or community life, rather than city life, should be\r\nextended to every other large city in the Nation. A simple act of\r\nlegislation, accompanied by a moderate appropriation for organization\r\nand educational work, would enable the department to put its facilities\r\nat the service of local communities and of the industries throughout the\r\nUnited States. This form of national leadership would be of value both\r\nto investors in the local securities and to the home builders\r\nthemselves. If the work of land acquisition and construction, together\r\nwith the organization of community settlements resulting therefrom, were\r\nconducted under the supervision of the State or the Federal Government\r\nit would safeguard the character of the movement from every point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I put first among the constructive things which may be done\r\nby the exercise of the Government's power of supervision and direction,\r\nwith the smallest outlay of money, this matter of providing suburban\r\nhomes for our millions of wage earners.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION BY DISTRICT ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe provision of garden homes for millions of city workers will\r\ncontribute largely to the Nation's food supply and become in time a most\r\neffective influence in reducing excessive cost of living for many of\r\nour people. It will not, of course, solve the problem of increasing the\r\nnumber of farms and the area of cultivation to meet the needs of growing\r\npopulation. Neither will it enable us to expand our home market rapidly\r\nand largely enough to keep the country on an even keel of prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe must go forward with the development of natural resources as we have\r\ndone for the past three centuries. And we must recognize at the outset\r\nthat conditions have changed with the depletion of the public domain to\r\nthe point where it offers comparatively little in the way of cultivable\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal principally with lands in private ownership. This\r\ncalls for a new point of view and for the application of a somewhat\r\ndifferent principle than that which has governed our reclamation policy\r\nheretofore. Moreover, reclamation is no longer an affair of one section\r\nof the United States. The day has come when it must be nationalized and\r\nextended to all parts of the Republic.\r\n\r\nTo the deserts of the West we have brought the creative touch of water,\r\nand we must find a way to go on with this work. But it is of equal\r\nimportance that we should liberate rich areas now held in bondage by the\r\nswamp, convert millions of acres of idle cut-over lands to profitable\r\nuse, and raise from the dead the once vigorous agricultural life of our\r\nabandoned farms.\r\n\r\nOne more fundamental consideration--we have outlived our day of small\r\nthings. Whether we would or not, we are compelled by the inexorable law\r\nof necessity arising out of existing physical conditions to cooperate,\r\nto work together, and to employ large-scale operations, and on this\r\nprinciple we should move: Not what the Government can do for the people,\r\nbut what the people can do for themselves under the intelligent and\r\nkindly leadership of the Government.\r\n\r\nWe have an instrument at hand in the Reclamation Service which has dealt\r\nwith every phase of the problem which now confronts us, and with such\r\nhigh average success as to command the entire confidence of Congress and\r\nthe country. It has turned rivers out of their natural beds, reared the\r\nhighest dams in existence, transported water long distances by every\r\nform of canal, conduit, and tunnel, installed electric power plants,\r\ncleared land, provided drainage systems, constructed highways and even\r\nrailroads, platted townsites, and erected buildings of various sorts. In\r\nthis experience, obtained under a variety of physical and climatic\r\nconditions, it has developed a body of trained men equal to any\r\nconstructive task which may be assigned to it in connection with\r\nreclamation and settlement in any part of the country.\r\n\r\nTrue economic reclamation is a process of converting liabilities into\r\nassets--of transforming dormant natural resources into agencies of\r\nliving production. When such a process is intelligently applied it\r\nshould be able to pay its own bills without placing fresh burdens on the\r\nnational treasury. It is in the confident belief that such is actually\r\nthe case that I suggest the policy of reclamation by means of local\r\ndistricts, financed on the basis of their own credit but with the\r\nfullest measure of encouragement and moral support of the Government,\r\npractically expressed through the Reclamation Service.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it seems worth while to recall that with a net\r\nexpenditure of $119,000,000 the Reclamation Service has created taxable\r\nvalues of $500,000,000 in the States where it has operated. The ratio is\r\nbetter than three to one, and that is a wider margin of security than is\r\nusually demanded by the most conservative banking methods. There is no\r\nreason to doubt that the overflow lands of the South, the cut-over areas\r\nof the Northwest, and the abandoned farm districts of New England and\r\nNew York and other States would do quite as well as the deserts of the\r\nWest if handled by such an organization.\r\n\r\nWhat is the legitimate function of the Government in connection with\r\nreclamation districts to be financed entirely upon their own credits\r\nwithout the aid of national appropriations? I should say that the\r\nGovernment, with great advantage to the investor, the landowner, the\r\nfuture settler, and the general public, might do these things:\r\n\r\n1. Employ its trained, experienced engineers, attorneys, and economists\r\nin making a thorough investigation of all the factors involved in a\r\ngiven situation, to be followed by a thorough official report upon the\r\ndistrict proposed to be formed.\r\n\r\n2. Offer the district securities for public subscription in the open\r\nmarket. This, of course, would follow the actual organization of the\r\ndistrict and the approval of its proceedings by the Government's legal\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\n3. Construct the works of reclamation with proceeds of district bond\r\nsales, and administer the system until it becomes a \"going concern,\"\r\nwhen it may be safely confided to its local officers.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious advantage of Government cooperation is the fact that it\r\nwould assure the service of a body of engineers, builders, and\r\nadministrators trained in the actual work of reclamation. This\r\nadvantage, as compared with the management that might be had in a\r\nsparsely settled local district, would often make all the difference\r\nbetween success and failure. Unquestionably it would materially reduce\r\nthe interest rate on district bonds and greatly facilitate their sale in\r\nthe open market.\r\n\r\nThere are other advantages less obvious but really more important.\r\nExperience has shown that great enterprises can best be handled under\r\ncentralized control. This control, to be effective, must extend from the\r\ninitiation to the completion of the project. There can be no assurance\r\nof this when the management is left to the electorate of a local\r\ndistrict, and without such assurance it is difficult to command the\r\nsupport, first, of the landowners whose consent is essential to the\r\nformation of the district; next, of the investors who must supply the\r\nmoney; finally, of the settlers who must purchase and develop the land\r\nin order that the object of the enterprise may be realized. The\r\nGovernment can give the assurance of precisely that quality of unified,\r\ncentralized, permanent, and responsible control that is required to\r\ncommand the confidence of all the factors in the situation.\r\n\r\nThere is another advantage of Government cooperation that will inure\r\ngreatly to the benefit of the settler. The Government may readily apply\r\nthe policy it now uses in connection with privately owned lands within\r\nreclamation projects. It requires the owners to enter into a contract by\r\nwhich they agree to accept a certain maximum price for their land if\r\nsold within a given period of years. This price is based upon the value\r\nof the land before reclamation. There are many instances, particularly\r\nof swamp and cut-over areas, where land that may be bought for $10 an\r\nacre and reclaimed at a cost of $25 to $50 per acre, has an actual\r\nmarket value of $100 to $200 per acre the moment it is put into shape\r\nfor cultivation. If the Government, by means of a contract with the\r\nlocal district, undertakes the work of reclamation and settlement and\r\ndoes this work at actual cost, the settler will generally save enough to\r\npay for all his improvements and equipment.\r\n\r\nThe crowning consideration is the fact that, because of all these\r\nadvantages, the work of reclamation would actually be accomplished,\r\nwhile to-day it is not being done except in the far West, and\r\naccomplished without the aid of Government appropriations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIER-SETTLEMENT LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing, attention has been called to those things which may be\r\naccomplished by the exercise of the Government's powers of supervision\r\nand direction with the smallest outlay of money. In all this I have been\r\nspeaking of reclamation for the sake of reclamation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed soldier-settlement legislation stands on an entirely\r\ndifferent footing. The primary object is not to reclaim land but to\r\nreward our returned soldiers with the opportunity to obtain employment\r\nand larger interest in the proprietorship of the country. The policy is\r\nbased on a sense of gratitude for heroic service, not on economic\r\nconsiderations. This is the answer to those who have criticized it as\r\nclass legislation or the proposal to grant special privileges to one\r\nelement of our citizenship or as a plunge into socialism. Frankly, we\r\navow our purpose to do for the soldier what we would not think of doing\r\nfor anybody else and what would not be justified solely as a matter of\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\nMany measures of soldier legislation have been introduced into Congress.\r\nOnly one of these has been favorably reported. This was introduced by\r\nRepresentative Mondell, of Wyoming, on the first day of the present\r\nspecial session, embodying the plan of reclamation and community\r\nsettlement brought forward by this department in the spring of 1918.\r\n\r\nThe measure has been much misunderstood and sometimes deliberately\r\nmisrepresented. In the first place, it was not put forward as the\r\ncomplete solution of the soldier problem. It was at no time supposed or\r\nexpected that all of the 4,800,000 men and women engaged in the war with\r\nGermany would or could take advantage of its provisions. It fortunately\r\nhappens that the vast majority quickly found their places in the\r\nnational life. Of the remainder, a very large proportion may be\r\nclassified as \"city minded.\" They have no taste for farm life but would\r\nbe better served by vocational training and opportunities to enter upon\r\nremunerative trades or professions. There is an element of \"country\r\nminded,\" and of these some 150,000 have made application for\r\nopportunities of employment and home-making under the terms of this\r\nbill. Largely they are men who have had agricultural experience but who\r\ncan not obtain farms of their own without very considerable cash\r\nadvances and other assistance which the Government could render. It is\r\nfor this element that the policy is designed.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that the plan would be applied only in the West\r\nand South. The truth is that it has been the purpose from the first to\r\nextend it to every State where feasible projects could be found, and\r\nthat our preliminary investigations lead us to believe this will include\r\nevery State in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe wide discussion of the measure has been highly educational to the\r\ncountry, and some of the criticism is of constructive character. For\r\nexample, attention has been sharply called to the fact that in certain\r\nlocalities there are individual farms well suited to our purpose which\r\nmay often be had at a price representing rather less than the value of\r\ntheir improvements. These are the so-called \"abandoned farms\" so\r\nnumerous in the Northeastern States. In some cases they are interspersed\r\nwith land now cultivated, so situated that it is not possible to bring\r\ntogether a large number of contiguous farms as the basis of a Government\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nIn New England and elsewhere public sentiment strongly favors a\r\nmodification of the pending measure which will enable the purchase of\r\nindividual farms rather than community settlement. This would be\r\npracticable only in localities where a sufficient number of farms, even\r\nif not contiguous, could be had to make possible the necessary\r\nsupervision and instruction, together with cooperative organization for\r\nthe purchase of supplies and sale of products. Without these advantages\r\nthe plan of soldier settlement would fail in many instances. My\r\ninformation is that these conditions could be met. Not only so, but it\r\nis urged that existing farm communities would be inspired by the\r\npresence of soldier settlers and benefited by the presence of soldier\r\nsettlers by their cooperative buying and selling agencies.\r\n\r\nAnother criticism of the pending measure is directed to the amount of\r\nthe first payment the soldier settler is required to make. As the bill\r\nnow stands it calls for 5 per cent on the land, 25 per cent on\r\nimprovements and live stock, and 40 per cent on implements and other\r\nequipment. It has been urged by some friends of soldier settlement that\r\nno first payment should be required, but that the Government should make\r\nadvances of 100 per cent in view of the soldiers' peculiar claim upon\r\nnational consideration. It might be feasible to do this in the case of\r\ncommunity settlements. But it could not be done in the case of scattered\r\nand individual farms, at least without abandoning the principles of\r\nsound business.\r\n\r\nIn the case of community settlement the soldier literally \"gets in on\r\nthe ground floor.\" Starting with a territory that is entirely blank so\r\nfar as homes and improvements are concerned, he finds himself in a place\r\nwhere community values remain to be created. When he buys an improved\r\nfarm in a settled neighborhood the situation is precisely reversed. In\r\nboth cases there is or will be \"unearned increment,\" or society-created\r\nvalues; but in the one case he _gets_ the increment, while in the other\r\ncase he _pays_ it. Obviously, a larger advance would be justified in one\r\ncase than in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nALASKA.\r\n\r\nOne of the first recommendations made by me in my report of seven years\r\nago was that the Government build a railroad from Seward to Fairbanks in\r\nAlaska. Five years ago you intrusted to me the direction of this work.\r\nThe road is now more than two-thirds built, and Congress at this\r\nsession, after exhaustively examining into the work, has authorized an\r\nadditional appropriation sufficient for its completion. The showing made\r\nbefore Congress was that the road had been built without graft: every\r\ndollar has gone into actual work or material. It has been built without\r\ngiving profits to any large contractors, for it has been constructed\r\nentirely by small contractors or by day's labor. It has been built\r\nwithout touch of politics: every man on the road has been chosen\r\nexclusively for ability and experience. It has been well and solidly\r\nbuilt as a permanent road, not an exploiting road. It has been built for\r\nas little money as private parties could have built it, as all competent\r\nindependent engineers who have seen the road advise.\r\n\r\nEdwin F. Wendt, of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in charge of\r\nvaluation of the railroads of the United States from Pittsburgh to\r\nBoston, after an investigation into the manner in which the Alaskan\r\nRailroad was constructed and its cost, reported to me as follows:\r\n\r\n     In concluding, it is not amiss to again state that after the full\r\n     study which was given to the property during our trip, we are\r\n     satisfied that the project is being executed rapidly and\r\n     efficiently by men of experience and ability. It is believed that\r\n     it is being handled as cheaply as private contractors could handle\r\n     it under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe road has not been built as soon as expected because each year we\r\nhave exhausted our appropriation before the work contemplated had been\r\ndone. We could not say in October of one year what the cost of anything\r\na year or more later would be, and we ran out of money earlier than\r\nanticipated. It has not been built as cheaply as expected because it has\r\nbeen built on a rising market for everything that went into its\r\nconstruction--from labor, lumber, food supplies, machinery, and steel to\r\nrail and ocean transportation. I believe, however, it can safely be said\r\nthat no other piece of Government construction or private construction\r\ndone during the war will show a less percentage of increase over a cost\r\nthat was estimated more than four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe men have been well housed and well fed. Their wages have been good\r\nand promptly paid; there has been but one strike, and that was four\r\nyears ago and was settled by Department of Labor experts fixing the\r\nscale of wages. The men have had the benefit of a system of compensation\r\nfor damages like that in the Reclamation Service and Panama Canal. They\r\nhave had excellent hospital service, and our camps and towns have been\r\nfree of typhoid fever and malaria. That the men like the work is\r\ntestified by the fact that hundreds who \"came out\" the past two years,\r\nattracted by the high wages of war industries, are now anxious to return\r\nto Alaska.\r\n\r\nThere has been but one setback in the construction, and that was the\r\nwashing out of 12 miles of tracks along the Nenana River. This is a\r\nglacial stream which, when the snows melt, comes down at times with\r\nirresistible force. In this instance it abandoned its long accustomed\r\nway and cut into a new bed and through trees that had been standing for\r\nseveral generations, tearing out part of the track which had been laid.\r\n\r\nThe work of locating and constructing the road has been left in the\r\nhands of the engineers appointed by yourself. The only instruction\r\nwhich they received from me was that they should build the road as if\r\nthey were working for a private concern, selecting the best men for the\r\nwork irrespective of politics or pressure of any kind. As a result, we\r\nhave a force that has been gathered from the construction camps of the\r\nwestern railroads, made up of men of experience and proved capacity.\r\nThat they have done their work efficiently, honestly, and at reasonable\r\ncost is my belief.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible during the construction of a railroad to tell what it\r\ncosts per mile because all the foundation work, the construction of\r\nbases from which to work, the equipment for construction, and much of\r\nthe material is a charge which must be spread over the entire completed\r\nline. The best estimate that can be made to-day as to the newly\r\nconstructed road is that it has cost between $70,000 and $80,000 per\r\nmain-line mile, or between $60,000 and $70,000 per mile of track.\r\n\r\nThis cost per mile includes the building of the most difficult and\r\nexpensive stretch of line along the entire route from Seward to\r\nFairbanks--that running along Turnagain Arm, which is sheer rock rising\r\nprecipitously from the sea for nearly 30 miles. There are miles of this\r\nroad which have cost $200,000 per mile. Even to blast a mule trail in\r\none portion of this route cost $25,000 a mile.\r\n\r\nThe only Government-built railroad--that across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama--cost $221,052 per mile. The only two recently built railroads in\r\nthe United States are (1) the Virginian, built by H.H. Rogers, which\r\ncost exclusive of equipment $151,000 per mile, with labor at from $1.35\r\nto $1.75 per day and all machinery, fuel, rails, and supplies at its\r\ndoor, and (2) the Milwaukee line to Puget Sound, which is estimated as\r\nhaving cost $130,000 per mile exclusive of equipment.\r\n\r\nThe work has been conducted with its main base at Anchorage, which is at\r\nthe head of Cook Inlet. The point was chosen as the nearest point from\r\nwhich to construct a railroad into the Matanuska coal fields. That was\r\nthe primary objective of the railroad, to get at the Matanuska coal.\r\nFrom Anchorage it was also intended to drive farther north through the\r\nSusitna Valley and across Broad Pass, and to the south along Turnagain\r\nArm toward the Alaska Northern track. To secure coal for Alaska was the\r\nfirst need. So in addition to Anchorage as a base, one was also started\r\nat Nenana, on the Tanana River, from which to reach the Nenana coal\r\nfields lying to the south. If these two fields were open, one would\r\nsupply the coast of Alaska and one the interior. This program has been\r\nacted upon, with the result that the Matanuska field is open to\r\ntidewater with a downgrade road all the way. The Nenana road has been\r\npushed far enough south to touch a coal mine near the track, which may\r\nobviate the immediate necessity for reaching into the Nenana field\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nThere is an open stretch across Broad Pass to connect the Susitna\r\nValley with the road coming down from Nenana. This gap closed, there\r\nwill be through connection between Seward and Fairbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATANUSKA COAL.\r\n\r\nBy decisions of the Commissioner of the Land Office all of the claims in\r\nthe Matanuska coal field were set aside, and by act of Congress a\r\nleasing bill was put into effect over the entire field. Under this law a\r\nnumber of claims must be reserved to the Government. The field was\r\nsurveyed, and some of the most promising portions of the field have been\r\nso reserved.\r\n\r\nTwo leases have been entered into by the Government, one with Lars\r\nNetland, a miner, who has a backer, Mr. Fontana, a business man of San\r\nFrancisco, and the other with Oliver La Duke and associates. There are\r\nmany thousands of acres in this field which are open for lease and which\r\nwill be leased to any responsible parties who will undertake their\r\ndevelopment. Government experts who have examined this field do not\r\npromise without further exploring a larger output of coal from this\r\nfield than 150,000 tons a year.\r\n\r\nThe population of Alaska has fallen off during the war. She sent, I am\r\ntold, 5,000 men into the Army, the largest proportion to population sent\r\nby any part of the United States. The high cost of labor and materials\r\nclosed some of the gold mines, and the attractive wages offered by war\r\nindustries drew labor from Alaska to the mainland. All prospecting\r\npractically closed. But with the return of peace there is evidence of a\r\nnew movement toward that Territory which should be given added\r\nconfidence in its future by the completion of the Alaskan Railroad.\r\nThere is enough arable land in Alaska to maintain a population the equal\r\nof all those now living in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and all that can\r\nbe produced in those countries can be produced in Alaska. The great need\r\nis a market, and this will be found only as the mining and fishing\r\nindustries of the country develop.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVE AND DEVELOP AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole story is told of American achievement and the picture is\r\npainted of our material resources, we come back to the plain but\r\nall-significant fact that far beyond all our possessions in land and\r\ncoal and waters and oil and industries is the American man. To him, to\r\nhis spirit and to his character, to his skill and to his intelligence is\r\ndue all the credit for the land in which we live. And that resource we\r\nare neglecting. He may be the best nurtured and the best clothed and the\r\nbest housed of all men on this great globe. He may have more chances to\r\nbecome independent and even rich. He may have opportunities for\r\nschooling nowhere else afforded. He may have a freedom to speak and to\r\nworship and to exercise his judgment over the affairs of the Nation. And\r\nyet he is the most neglected of our resources because he does not know\r\nhow rich he is, how rich beyond all other men he is. Not rich in\r\nmoney--I do not speak of that--but rich in the endowment of powers and\r\npossibilities no other man ever was given.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five per cent of the 1,600,000 men between 21 and 31 years of age\r\nwho were first drafted into our Army could not read nor write our\r\nlanguage, and tens of thousands could not speak it nor understand it. To\r\nthem the daily paper telling what Von Hindenberg was doing was a blur.\r\nTo them the appeals of Hoover came by word of mouth, if at all. To them\r\nthe messages of their commander in chief were as so much blank paper. To\r\nthem the word of mother or sweetheart came filtering in through other\r\neyes that had to read their letters.\r\n\r\nNow this is wrong. There is something lacking in the sense of a society\r\nthat would permit it in a land of public schools that assumes leadership\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nHere is raw material truly, of the most important kind and the greatest\r\npossibility for good as well as for ill.\r\n\r\nSave! Save! Save! This has been the mandate for the past two years. It\r\nis a word with which this report is replete. But we have been talking of\r\nfood and land and oil while the boys and young men that are about us who\r\ncarry the fortune of the democracy in their hands are without a primary\r\nknowledge of our institutions, our history, our wars and what we have\r\nfought for, our men and what they have stood for, our country and what\r\nits place in the world is.\r\n\r\nThe marvelous force of public opinion and the rare absorbing quality of\r\nthe American mind never was shown more clearly than by the fact that out\r\nof these men came a loyalty and a stern devotion to America when the day\r\nof test came. Had Germany known what we know now, it would have been\r\nbeyond her to believe that America could draft an army to adventure into\r\nwar in Europe. There should not be a man who was in our Army or our Navy\r\nwho has the ambition for an education who should not be given that\r\nopportunity--indeed, induced to take it--not merely out of appreciation\r\nbut out of the greater value to the Nation that he would be if the tools\r\nof life were put into his hand. There is no word to say upon this theme\r\nof Americanization that has not been said, and Congress, it is now\r\nhoped, will believe those figures which, when presented nearly two years\r\nago, were flouted as untrue. The Nation is humiliated at its own\r\nindifference, and action must be the result.\r\n\r\nTo save and to develop, I have said, were equally the expression of a\r\ntrue conservation. What is true as to material things is true as to\r\nhuman beings. And once given a foundation of health there is no other\r\ncourse by which this policy may be effected than to place at the command\r\nof every one the means of acquiring knowledge. The whole people must\r\nturn in that direction. We should enable all, without distinction, to\r\nhave that training for which they are fitted by their own natural\r\nendowment. Then we can draw out of hiding the talents that have been\r\nhidden. The school will yet come to be the first institution of our\r\nland, in acknowledged preeminence in the making of Americans who\r\nunderstand why they are Americans and why to be one is worth while.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Extract from the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior for\r\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 1919. The page numbers are the same as\r\nthose in the report.\r\n\r\n[2] In spite of the strike order, effective the last day of the week,\r\nthe production of soft coal during the seven days Oct. 26-Nov. 1 was\r\ngreater than in any week this year save one. The exception was the\r\npreceding week, that of Oct. 25, which full reports now confirm as the\r\nrecord in the history of coal mining in the United States. The total\r\nproduction during the week ended Nov. 1 (including lignite and coal made\r\ninto coke) is estimated at 12,142,000 net tons, an average per working\r\nday of 2,024,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIndeed had it not been for the strike, curtailing the output of\r\nSaturday, the week of Nov. 1 would have far outstripped its predecessor.\r\nThe extraordinary efforts made by the railroads to provide cars bore\r\nfruit in a rate of production during the first five days of the week\r\nwhich, if maintained for the 304 working days of full-time year, would\r\nyield 715,000,000 tons of coal. It is worth noting that this figure is\r\nalmost identical with the 700,000,000 tons accepted early in 1918 by the\r\nGeological Survey and the Railroad Administration as representing the\r\ncountry's annual capacity. During these five days, therefore, the\r\nsoft-coal mines were working close to actual capacity. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that the output on Monday, Oct. 27, was the largest ever\r\nattained in a single day. (U.S. Geol. Survey Bull.)\r\n\r\n[3] It is the western and southern fields that are most affected by the\r\nseasonal demand. As a typical example, Illinois may be cited, with 18\r\nper cent of the year's production in 25 per cent of the time, April,\r\nMay, and June, in 1915, and 15 per cent in 1916. Retail dealers received\r\n27 per cent of the coal from Illinois in the period from August, 1918,\r\nto February, 1919, compared with 4 per cent from the Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[4] In every trainload of coal hauled from the mines to our coal bins, 1\r\ncarload out of every 5 is going nowhere. In a train of 40 cars, the last\r\n8 are dead load that might better have been left in the bowels of the\r\nearth. No less an authority than Martin A. Rooney states: \"Every fifth\r\nshovel full of coal that the average fireman throws into his furnace\r\nserves no more useful purpose than to decorate the atmosphere with a\r\nlong black stream of precious soot. At best one-fifth of all our coal is\r\nwasted.\"\r\n\r\nThe first requisite toward effecting fuel economy is to secure\r\ncooperation between owners, managers, and the men who fire the coal.\r\nMechanical devices to increase efficiency in the use of coal can not\r\nproduce satisfactory results unless the operators who handle them are\r\nimpressed with the importance of their duties.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential for the plant manager to be a fuel expert, but he\r\nshould be familiar with the instruments that give a check on the daily\r\noperations. It is a mistake not to provide proper instruments, for they\r\nguide the firemen and show the management what has taken place daily.\r\nInstruments provided for the boiler room manifest the interest taken by\r\nthe management toward conserving fuel. It indicates cooperation and\r\nencourages the firemen to work harder to increase the efficiency.\r\n\r\nA second factor effecting fuel economy is the selection of fuel for the\r\nparticular plant. It is not expected of a plant manager that he should\r\nbe thoroughly informed as to the character of all fuels; but he can\r\nenlist the services of a man who is thoroughly trained In this field.\r\nThe Bureau of Mines has compiled valuable information on the character\r\nand analyses of coal from almost every field in the United States.\r\nInformation concerning the character and chemical constituents of the\r\ncoal, together with knowledge pertaining to the equipment of the plant,\r\nmakes it possible to select a fuel adapted to the equipment, thereby\r\ninsuring better combustion. Hundreds of boiler plants operate at no\r\ngreater than 60 per cent efficiency, and it would be a comparatively\r\nsimple matter to bring them up to 70 per cent efficiency. The saving in\r\ntonnage would be more than the combined yearly coal-carrying capacity of\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio and the Southern Railway systems. The direct saving\r\nto our industries at $5 per ton would amount to $200,000,000 worth of\r\ncoal per year.\r\n\r\n[5] Assistant Secretary Herbert Kaufman before the Senate Committee on\r\nEducation presented facts and figures which accentuate the seriousness\r\nof the national situation. Among other things he said:\r\n\r\n\"The South leads in illiteracy, but the North leads in non-English\r\nspeaking. Over 17 per cent of the persons in the east-south Central\r\nStates have never been to school. Approximately 16 per cent of the\r\npeople of Passaic, N.J., must deal with their fellow workers and\r\nemployers through interpreters. And 13 per cent of the folk in Lawrence\r\nand Fall River, Mass., are utter strangers in a strange land.\r\n\r\n\"The extent to which our industries are dependent upon this labor is\r\nperilous to all standards of efficiency. Their ignorance not only\r\nretards production and confuses administration, but constantly piles up\r\na junk heap of broken humans and damaged machines which cost the Nation\r\nincalculably.\r\n\r\n\"It is our duty to interpret America to all potential Americans in terms\r\nof protection as well as of opportunity; and neither the opportunities\r\nof this continent nor that humanity which is the genius of American\r\ndemocracy can be rendered intelligible to these 8,000,000 until they can\r\ntalk and read and write our language.\r\n\r\n\"Steel and iron manufacturers employ 58 per cent of foreign-born\r\nhelpers; the slaughtering and meat-packing trades, 61 per cent;\r\nbituminous coal mining, 62 per cent; the silk and dye trade, 34 per\r\ncent; glass-making enterprises, 38 per cent; woolen mills, 62 per cent;\r\ncotton factories, 69 per cent; the clothing business, 72 per cent; boot\r\nand shoe manufacturers, 27 per cent; leather tanners, 57 per cent;\r\nfurniture factories, 59 per cent; glove manufacturers, 33 per cent;\r\ncigar and tobacco trades, 33 per cent; oil refiners, 67 per cent; and\r\nsugar refiners, 85 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"You will agree with me that future security compels attention to such\r\nconcentrations of unread, unsocialized masses thus conveniently and\r\nperilously grouped for misguidance.\r\n\r\n\"They live in America, but America does not live in them. How can all be\r\n'free and equal' until they have free access to the same sources of\r\nself-help and an equal chance to secure them?\r\n\r\n\"Illiteracy is a pick-and-shovel estate, a life sentence to meniality.\r\nDemocracy may not have fixed classes and survive. The first duty of\r\nCongress is to preserve opportunity for the whole people, and\r\nopportunity can not exist where there is no means of information.\r\n\r\n\"It is a shabby economy, an ungrateful economy that withholds funds for\r\ntheir betterment. The fields of France cry shame upon those who are\r\ncontent to abandon them to their handicap.\r\n\r\n\"The loyal service of immigrant soldiers and sailors commit us to\r\ninstruct and nationalize their brothers in breed.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit in which these United States were conceived insists that the\r\nRepublic remove the cruel disadvantage under which so many native borns\r\ndespairingly carry on.\r\n\r\n\"How may they reason soundly or plan sagely? The man who knows nothing\r\nof the past can find little in the future. The less he has gleaned from\r\nhuman experience the more he may be expected to duplicate its signal\r\nerrors. No argument is too ridiculous for acceptance; no sophistry can\r\nseem far-fetched to a person without the sense to confound it.\r\n\r\n\"Anarchy shall never want for mobs while the uninformed are left at the\r\nmercy of false prophets. Those who have no way to estimate the worth of\r\nAmerica are unlikely to value its institutions fairly. Blind to facts,\r\nthe wildest one-eyed argument can sway them.\r\n\r\n\"Not until we can teach our illiterate millions the truths about the\r\nland to which they have come and in which they were born shall its\r\nspirit reach them--not until they can read can we set them right and\r\nempower them to inherit their estate.\r\n\r\n\"If we continue to neglect them, there are influences at work that will\r\nsooner or later convince them who now fail to appreciate the worth of\r\nour Government that the Government itself has failed--crowd the melting\r\npot with class hates and violence and befoul its yield.\r\n\r\n\"We must not be tried by inquest. We demand the right to vindicate the\r\nmerit of our systems wherever their integrity is questioned or maligned.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to regulate the cheating scales upon which the\r\nRepublic is weighed by its ill-wishers.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to protect unintelligence from Esau bargains with\r\nhucksters of traitorous creeds.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to present our case and our cause to the unlettered\r\nmass, whose benightedness and ready prejudices continually invite\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to vaccinate credulous inexperience against\r\nBolshevism and kindred plagues.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to render all whose kind we deem fit to fight for\r\nour flag fit to vote and prosper under its folds.\r\n\r\n\"We demand the right to bring the American language to every American,\r\nto qualify each inhabitant of these United States for self-determination,\r\nself-uplift, and self-defense.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Philander P. Claxton, Commissioner of Education, in his analysis of\r\nthe illiteracy figures of the census, said:\r\n\r\n\"Illiteracy is not confined to any one race or class or section. Of the\r\n5,500,000 illiterates as reported by the census of 1910, nearly\r\n3,225,000 were whites, and more than 1,500,000 were native-born whites.\r\n\r\n\"That illiteracy is not a problem of any one section alone is shown by\r\nthe fact that in 1910 Massachusetts had 7,469 more illiterate men of\r\nvoting age than Arkansas; Michigan, 2,663 more than West Virginia;\r\nMaryland, 2,352 more than Florida; Ohio, more than twice as many as New\r\nMexico and Arizona combined; Pennsylvania, 5,689 more than Tennessee and\r\nKentucky combined. Boston had more illiterates than Baltimore,\r\nPittsburgh more than New Orleans, Fall River more than Birmingham,\r\nProvidence nearly twice as many as Nashville, and the city of Washington\r\n5,000 more than the city of Memphis.\r\n\r\n\"It is especially significant that of the 1,534,272 native-born white\r\nilliterates reported in the 1910 census 1,342,372, about 87.5 per cent,\r\nwere in the open country and small towns, and only 191,900, or 12.5 per\r\ncent, were in cities having a population of 2,500 and over. Of the\r\n2,227,731 illiterate negroes 1,834,458, or 82.3 per cent, were in the\r\ncountry, and only 393,273, or 17.7 per cent, were in the cities.\"\r\n\r\n ADDITIONAL COPIES\r\n OF THIS PUBLICATION MAY BE PROCURED FROM\r\n THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS\r\n GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\r\n WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n AT\r\n 10 CENTS PER COPY",
