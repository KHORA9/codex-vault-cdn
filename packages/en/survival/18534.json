How far he has succeeded, either in\r\nthis particular object or in endeavouring to render the essential\r\nphænomena of storms familiar to the seaman, is left for the Public to\r\ndetermine. Should any advantage be found to result from the study of the\r\nAtmospheric Waves, as explained and recommended in this little work, or\r\nthe seaman be induced by its perusal to attend more closely to the\r\nobservations of those instruments that are calculated to warn him of his\r\ndanger, an object will be attained strikingly illustrative of the\r\nBaconian aphorism, \"Knowledge is Power.\"\r\n\r\n    _Bethnal Green_, April 19, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

The laws that govern the transmission of large\r\nbodies of air from one part of the oceanic surface to another, either in\r\na state of rapid rotation or presenting a more or less rectilineal\r\ndirection, must at all times form an important matter of inquiry, and\r\nbear very materially on the successful prosecution of the occupation of\r\nthe voyager.\r\n\r\nIn order to place the subjects above alluded to in such a point of view\r\nthat the connexion between them may be readily seen, it will be\r\nimportant to notice the principal phænomena presented by each. Without\r\ngoing over the ground so well occupied by those able writers on the\r\nsubject of storms--Redfield, Reid, Piddington, and Thom--it will be\r\nquite sufficient for our present purpose simply to notice the essential\r\nphænomena of revolving storms as manifested by the barometer and vane.\r\nThe usual indications of a storm in connexion with these instruments are\r\nthe _falling_ of the barometer and the _freshening_ of the wind, and it\r\nis generally considered that a _rapid_ fall of the mercury in the\r\nhurricane regions invariably precedes the setting in of a storm.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of phænomena that present themselves to an\r\nobserver, according as he is situated _on_ the line or axis of\r\ntranslation, or _in_ either the right or left hand semicircle of the\r\nstorm. These will be rendered very apparent by a little attention to the\r\nannexed engraving, fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Compass rose]\r\n\r\nIn this figure the arrow-head is supposed to be directed true north, and\r\nthe hurricane--as is the case in the American storms north of the 30th\r\nparallel--to be moving towards the N.E. on the line N.E.--S.W. If the\r\nship take the hurricane with the wind S.E.,--the letters within the two\r\nlarger circles indicating _the direction of the wind in the storm_\r\naccording to the rotation as shown by the circle of arrow-heads, and\r\nwhich it is to be particularly noted is in the northern hemisphere\r\n_contrary to the direction in which the hands of a watch move_: in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere the rotation is reversed--the only phænomena\r\npresented by the storm are as follows:--The wind continues to blow from\r\nthe S.E., increasing considerably in force with the barometer falling to\r\na very great extent until the centre of the storm reaches the ship, when\r\nthe fury of the winds is hushed, and a lull or calm takes place,\r\ngenerally for about half an hour, after which the wind springs up mostly\r\nwith increased violence, but from the opposite quarter N.W., the\r\nbarometer begins to rise, and as the storm passes off, the force of the\r\nwind abates.\r\n\r\nThe point to which we wish particularly to direct attention in connexion\r\nwith this exposition of the phænomena attending the transmission of a\r\nstorm is this:--If the observer so place himself at the commencement\r\nthat the wind passes _from his left hand towards his right_, his face\r\nwill be directed towards the centre of the storm; and the wind\r\nundergoing no change in direction, but only in force, will acquaint him\r\nwith this important fact that the _centre_ is not only gradually but\r\nsurely approaching him: in other words, in the case before us, when he\r\nfinds the wind from the S.E., and he places himself with his face to the\r\nS.W. he is looking towards the centre, and the wind rushes past him\r\n_from his left to his right hand_. Now the connexion of the barometer\r\nwith this phase of the storm is _falling with the wind from left to\r\nright, the observer facing the centre while the first half is\r\ntransiting_.[1] During the latter half these conditions are reversed,\r\nthe observer still keeping his position, his face directed to the S.W.,\r\nthe barometer _rises_ with a N.W. wind, which rushes past him _from his\r\nright to his left hand_ with a decreasing force. We have therefore _a\r\nrising barometer with the wind from right to left during the latter half\r\nof the storm, the observer having his back to the centre_.\r\n\r\nThe above _general_ enunciations of the barometric and anemonal\r\nphænomena of a rotating storm hold good with regard to the _northern_\r\nhemisphere, whatever may be the direction in which the hurricanes\r\nadvance. This may be placed in a clearer light, as well as the remaining\r\nclasses of phænomena shown, by consulting the following tables,\r\nconstructed for the basin of the Northern Atlantic, and comparing them\r\nwith fig. 1. In this basin, with lower latitudes than 25°, the usual\r\npaths of the hurricanes are towards the north-west, in higher latitudes\r\nthan 30° towards the north-east. The tables exhibit the veering of the\r\nwind with the movements of the barometer, according as the ship is\r\nsituated in the right or left hand semicircle of the hurricane. It must\r\nhere be understood that the right and left hand semicircles are\r\ndetermined by the observer so placing himself that his face is directed\r\ntowards the quarter to which the hurricane is advancing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER LATITUDES.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n  Axis line, wind N.E., barometer falling, first half of storm.\r\n  Axis line, wind S.W., barometer rising, last half of storm.\r\n\r\nRIGHT-HAND SEMICIRCLE.\r\n\r\n  Wind E.N.E., E., E.S.E., S.E., barometer falling, storm increasing.\r\n  Wind S.S.W., S., S.S.E., S.E., barometer rising, storm passing off.\r\n\r\nLEFT-HAND SEMICIRCLE.\r\n\r\n  Wind N.N.E., N., N.N.W., N.W., barometer falling, storm increasing.\r\n  Wind W.S.W., W., W.N.W., N.W., barometer rising, storm passing off.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHER LATITUDES.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN HEMISPHERE.[2]\r\n\r\n  Axis line, wind S.E., barometer falling, first half of storm.\r\n  Axis line, wind N.W., barometer rising, last half of storm.\r\n\r\nRIGHT-HAND SEMICIRCLE.\r\n\r\n  Wind S.S.E., S., S.S.W., S.W., barometer falling, storm increasing.\r\n  Wind W.N.W., W., W.S.W., S.W., barometer rising, storm passing off.\r\n\r\nLEFT-HAND SEMICIRCLE.\r\n\r\n  Wind E.S.E., E., E.N.E., N.E., barometer falling, storm increasing.\r\n  Wind N.N.W., N., N.N.E., N.E., barometer rising, storm passing off.\r\n\r\nN.B. The directions of the hurricane winds are so arranged as to show\r\nthe points of commencement and termination. Thus in the lower latitudes\r\na storm commencing at E.N.E. passes off at S.S.W. after the wind has\r\nveered E., E.S.E., S.E., S.S.E., and S., being in the order of the\r\nletters in the upper line and contrary to their order in the lower. One\r\ncommencing at E.S.E. passes off at S.S.E. right-hand semicircle. In the\r\nhigher latitudes a ship taking the storm at E.N.E. will be in the\r\nleft-hand semicircle, and the hurricane will pass off at N.N.E. These\r\nchanges are rendered very apparent by moving the hurricane circle in the\r\ndirection in which the storm is expected to proceed.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents the whirl and hurricane winds in the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPHÆNOMENA OF ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Dove of Berlin has suggested that in the temperate zones the\r\ncompensating currents of the atmosphere necessary to preserve its\r\nequilibrium may be arranged as parallel currents on the _surface_, and\r\nnot superposed as in or near the torrid zone. His views may be thus\r\nenunciated:--That in the parallels of central Europe the N.E. current\r\nflowing towards the equator to feed the ascending column of heated air\r\nis not compensated by a current in the upper regions of the atmosphere\r\nflowing from the S.W. as in the border of the torrid zone, but there are\r\nalso S.W. currents on each side the N.E., which to the various countries\r\nover which they pass appear as surface-winds, the winds in fact being\r\ndisposed in alternate beds or layers, S.W., N.E., as in fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe Professor also suggests that these parallel and oppositely directed\r\nwinds are shifting, _i. e._ they gradually change their position with a\r\nlateral motion in the direction of the large arrow cutting them\r\ntransversely.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the author's researches on atmospheric waves he had an\r\nopportunity of testing the correctness of Professor Dove's suggestion,\r\nand in addition ascertained that there existed another set of oppositely\r\ndirected winds at right angles to those supposed to exist by the\r\nProfessor. These currents were N.W. and S.E. with a lateral motion\r\ntowards the N.E. He also carefully discussed the barometric phænomena\r\nwith relation to both these sets of currents, and arrived at the\r\nfollowing conclusions. The details will be found in the author's third\r\nreport, presented to the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience (Reports, 1846, pp. 132 to 162). During the period under\r\nexamination the author found the barometer generally to rise with N.E.\r\nand N.W. winds, and fall with S.W. and S.E. winds, and that the\r\nphænomena might be thus illustrated:--Let the strata _a a a' a', b' b' b\r\nb_, fig. 3, represent two parallel aërial currents or winds, _a a a' a'_\r\nfrom S.W. or S.E., and _b' b' b b_ from N.E. or N.W. and conceive them\r\nboth to advance from the N.W. in the first instance and from the S.W. in\r\nthe second, in the direction of the large arrow. Now conceive the\r\nbarometer to commence rising just as the edge _b b_ passes any line of\r\ncountry, and to continue rising until the edge _b' b'_ arrives at that\r\nline, when the maximum is attained. It will be remarked that this rise\r\nis coincident with a N.E. or N.W. wind. The wind now changes and the\r\nbarometer begins to fall, and continues falling until the edge _a a_\r\ncoincides with the line of country on which _b b_ first impinged.\r\nDuring this process we have all the phænomena exhibited by an\r\natmospheric wave: when the edge _b b_ passes a line of country the\r\nbarometer is at a _minimum_, and this minimum has been termed the\r\n_anterior trough_. During the period the stratum _b' b' b b_ transits,\r\nthe barometer rises, and this rise has been called the _anterior slope_.\r\nWhen the conterminous edges of the strata _a' a' b' b'_ pass, a\r\nbarometric _maximum_ extends along the line of country formerly occupied\r\nby the anterior trough, and this maximum has been designated the\r\n_crest_. During the transit of the stratum _a' a' a a_ the barometer\r\n_falls_, and this fall has been characterised as the _posterior slope_;\r\nand when the edge _a a_ occupies the place of _b b_, the descent of the\r\nmercurial column is completed, another _minimum_ extends in the\r\ndirection of the former, and this minimum has been termed the _posterior\r\ntrough_.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that the lateral passage of the N.W. and S.E.\r\ncurrents towards the N.E. presents precisely the same barometric and\r\nanemonal phænomena as the rotatory storms when moving in the same\r\ndirection. If the observer, when the barometer is at a _maximum_ with a\r\nN.W. wind, place himself in the same position with regard to the\r\nlaterally advancing current as he did with regard to the advancing\r\nstorm, _i. e._ with his face _towards_ the quarter from which it is\r\nadvancing--S.W., he will find that with a _falling barometer and S.E.\r\nwind the current passes him from the left to the right hand_; but if at\r\na barometric _minimum_ he place himself in the same position with his\r\nface directed to the quarter from which the N.W. current is advancing\r\nlaterally, also S.W., he will find that with a rising barometer _and\r\nN.W. wind the current passes him from right to left_. Now the two\r\nclasses of phænomena are identical, and it would not be difficult to\r\nshow that, had we an instance of a rotatory storm in the northern\r\nhemisphere moving from N.W. to S.E., it would present precisely the same\r\nphænomena as to the direction of currents passing from left to right and\r\nfrom right to left with falling and rising barometers, increase and\r\ndecrease in the force of the wind, &c., as the oppositely directed\r\naërial currents do which pass over western central Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of direct evidence of the production of a revolving storm\r\nfrom the crossing of two large waves, as suggested by Sir John Herschel,\r\nalthough it is not difficult to obtain such evidence, especially from\r\nthe surface of the ocean, the identity of the two classes of phænomena\r\nexhibited by the storms and waves as above explained amounts to a strong\r\npresumption that there is a close connexion between them, and that a\r\nmore minute investigation of the phænomena of atmospheric waves is\r\ngreatly calculated to throw considerable light on the laws that govern\r\nthe storm paths in both hemispheres. The localities in which these\r\natmospheric movements, the waves, have been hitherto studied, have been\r\nconfined to the northern and central parts of Europe--the west of\r\nIreland, Alten in the north of Europe, Lougan near the Sea of Azov, and\r\nGeneva, being the angular points of the included area. It will be\r\nremarked that the greatest portion of this area is _inland_, but there\r\nis one important feature which the study of the barometer has brought to\r\nlight, and which is by no means devoid of significance, viz. that the\r\noscillations are much greater in the neighbourhood of _water_, and this\r\nappears to indicate that the junction lines of land and water form by\r\nfar the most important portions of the globe in which to study both the\r\nphænomena of storms and waves. It is also very desirable that our\r\nknowledge of these phænomena should, with immediate reference to the\r\nsurface of the ocean, be increased, and in this respect captains and\r\nmasters of vessels may render essential service by observing and\r\nrecording the state of the barometer, and direction and force of the\r\nwind, several times in the course of the day and night;[3] and when it\r\nis considered that the immediate object in view is one in which the\r\nmariner is personally interested, and one in which, it may be, his own\r\nsafety is concerned, it is hoped that the keeping of a meteorological\r\nregister having especial reference to the indications of the barometer,\r\nand force and direction of the wind, will not be felt as irksome, but\r\nrather will be found an interesting occupation, the instruments standing\r\nin the place of faithful monitors, directing when and where to avoid\r\ndanger, and the record furnishing important data whereby the knowledge\r\nof general laws may be arrived at, having an essential bearing on the\r\ninterests of the service at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sketching out a system of observation having especial reference to\r\natmospheric waves and rotatory storms, regard has been had--_first_, to\r\nthe instruments that should be used, the observations to be made with\r\nthem, the corrections to be applied to such observations, and the form\r\nof registry most suitable for recording the results: _second_, to the\r\ntimes of observation: _third_, to the more important localities that\r\nshould be submitted to additional observation: _fourth_, to peculiar\r\nphænomena requiring extraordinary observations for their elucidation:\r\nand _fifth_, to particular seasons, when the instruments should be\r\nwatched with more than ordinary care.\r\n\r\nThe more important objects of observation having especial reference to\r\natmospheric waves are those points which have been termed _crests_ and\r\n_troughs_. These are simply the _highest_ and _lowest_ readings of the\r\nbarometer, usually designated _maxima_ and _minima_, and should for the\r\nobject in view receive particular attention. Whenever there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the barometer is approaching either a _maximum_ or\r\n_minimum_, additional observations should be resorted to, so as to\r\nsecure as nearly as possible _the precise time_ as reckoned at the ship,\r\nwith her position, of its occurrence, as well as the altitude of the\r\nmercurial column at that time and place. By means of such observations\r\nas these on board several ships scattered over the surfaces of our great\r\noceans, much valuable information may be accumulated of a character\r\ncapable of throwing considerable light on the _direction_ in which the\r\nlines of barometric maxima and minima stretch, and also a tolerably\r\naccurate notion may be formed of their progress, both as regards\r\ndirection and rate. In immediate connexion with such observations\r\nparticular attention should be paid to the direction of the wind\r\naccording to the season.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n_Description and Position of Instruments._--The principal instrument\r\nrequisite in these observations is the barometer, which should be of the\r\nmarine construction, and as nearly alike as possible to those furnished\r\nto the Antarctic expedition which sailed under the command of Sir James\r\nClark Ross. These instruments were similar to the ordinary portable\r\nbarometers, and differed from them only in the mode of their suspension\r\nand the necessary contraction of the tubes to prevent oscillation from\r\nthe motion of the ship. The barometer on shipboard should be suspended\r\non a gimbal frame, which ought not to swing too freely, but rather so as\r\nto deaden oscillations by some degree of friction. To the upper portion\r\nof the tube in this construction of instrument light is alike accessible\r\neither in front or behind, and the vernier is furnished with a back and\r\nfront edge, both being in precisely the same plane, nearly embracing the\r\ntube, and sliding up and down it by the motion of rack-work; by the\r\ngraduation of the scale and vernier the altitude of the mercury can be\r\nread off to ·002 inch.\r\n\r\nWhen the barometer is placed in the ship, its position should be as near\r\nmidships as possible, out of the reach of sunshine, but in a good light\r\nfor reading, and in a situation in which it will be but little liable to\r\nsudden gusts of wind and changes of temperature. Great care should be\r\ntaken to ascertain the exact height of its cistern above the water-line,\r\nand in order to facilitate night observations every possible arrangement\r\nshould be made for placing behind it a light screened by white paper.\r\n\r\n_Observations._--The first thing to be done is the reading off and\r\nrecording the temperature indicated by the thermometer that in this\r\nconstruction of instrument dips into the mercury in the cistern. Sir\r\nJohn Herschel has suggested that \"the bulb of the thermometer should be\r\nso situated as to afford the best chance of its indicating the exact\r\nmean of the whole barometric column, that is to say, fifteen inches\r\nabove the cistern enclosed within the case of the barometer, nearly in\r\ncontact with its tube, and with a stem so long as to be read off at the\r\nupper level.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to making an observation with the barometer the instrument\r\nshould be slightly tapped to free the mercury from any adhesion to the\r\nglass; any violent oscillation should, however, be carefully avoided.\r\nThe vernier should then be adjusted to the upper surface of the mercury\r\nin the tube; for this purpose its back and front edges should be made to\r\ncoincide, that is, the eye should be placed in exactly the same plane\r\nwhich passes through the edges; they should then be brought carefully\r\ndown until they form a tangent with the curve produced by the convex\r\nsurface of the mercury and the light is _just_ excluded from between\r\nthem and the point of contact. It is desirable in making this adjustment\r\nthat the eye should be assisted by a magnifying-glass. The reading of\r\nthe scale should then be taken and entered in the column appropriated to\r\nit in the proper form. If the instrument have no tubular or double-edged\r\nindex, the eye should be placed carefully at the level of the upper\r\nsurface of the mercury and the index of the vernier brought gently down\r\nto the same level so as apparently just to touch the surface, great care\r\nbeing taken that the eye index and surface of the mercury are all in the\r\nsame plane.\r\n\r\nEach observation of the barometer should be accompanied by an\r\nobservation of the direction of the wind, which should be noted in the\r\nusual manner in which it is observed at sea. In connexion with the\r\n_direction_ the _force_ of the wind should be recorded in accordance\r\nwith the following scale, contrived by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort:--\r\n\r\n  0. Calm\r\n  1.

Hurricane        or that which no canvas could withstand.\r\n\r\n_Corrections._--As soon after the observations have been made as\r\ncircumstances will permit, the reading of the barometer should be\r\n_corrected_ for the relation existing between the capacities of the tube\r\nand cistern (if its construction be such as to require that correction),\r\nand for the capillary action of the tube; and then _reduced_ to the\r\nstandard temperature of 32° Fahr., and to the sea-level, if on\r\nshipboard. For the first correction the _neutral point_ should be marked\r\nupon each instrument. It is that particular height which, in its\r\nconstruction, has been actually measured from the surface of the mercury\r\nin the cistern, and indicated by the scale. In general the mercury will\r\nstand either above or below the neutral point; if _above_, a portion of\r\nthe mercury must have left the cistern, and consequently must have\r\n_lowered_ the surface in the cistern: in this case the altitude as\r\nmeasured by the scale will be _too short--vice versâ_, if below. The\r\nrelation of the capacities of the tube and cistern should be\r\nexperimentally ascertained, and marked upon the instrument by the maker.\r\nSuppose the capacity to be 1/50, marked thus on the instrument,\r\n\"_Capacity 1/50:_\" this indicates that for every inch of variation of\r\nthe mercury in the tube, that in the cistern will vary contrariwise\r\n1/50th of an inch. When the mercury in the tube is _above_ the neutral\r\npoint, the difference between it and the neutral point is to be reduced\r\nin the proportion expressed by the \"capacity\" (in the case supposed,\r\ndivided by 50), and the quotient _added_ to the observed height; if\r\n_below, subtracted_ from it. In barometers furnished with a fiducial\r\npoint for adjusting the lower level, this correction is superfluous, and\r\nmust not be applied.\r\n\r\nThe second correction required is for the capillary action of the tube,\r\nthe effect of which is always to depress the mercury in the tube by a\r\ncertain quantity inversely proportioned to the diameter of the tube.\r\nThis quantity should be experimentally determined during the\r\nconstruction of the instrument, and its amount marked upon it by the\r\nmaker, and is always to be _added_ to the height of the mercurial\r\ncolumn, previously corrected as before. For the convenience of those who\r\nmay have barometers, the capillary action of which has not been\r\ndetermined, a table of corrections for tubes of different diameters is\r\nplaced in the Appendix, Table I.\r\n\r\nThe next correction, and in some respects the most important of all, is\r\nthat due to the temperature of the mercury in the barometer tube at the\r\ntime of observation, and to the expansion of the scale. Table II. of the\r\nAppendix gives for every degree of the thermometer and every half-inch\r\nof the barometer, the proper quantity to be added or subtracted for the\r\nreduction of the observed height to the standard temperature of the\r\nmercury at 32° Fahr.\r\n\r\nAfter these the index correction should be applied. This is the amount\r\nof difference between the particular instrument and the readings of the\r\nRoyal Society's flint-glass barometer when properly corrected, and is\r\ngenerally known as the _zero_. It is impossible to pay too much\r\nattention to the determination of this point. For this purpose, when\r\npracticable, the instrument should be immediately compared with the\r\nRoyal Society's standard, and the difference of the readings of both\r\ninstruments, when corrected as above, carefully noted and preserved.\r\nWhere, however, this is impracticable, the comparison should be effected\r\nby means either of some other standard previously so compared, or of an\r\nintermediate portable barometer, the zero point of which has been _well\r\ndetermined_. Suspend the portable barometer as near as convenient to the\r\nship's barometer, and after at least an hour's quiet exposure, take as\r\nmany readings of both instruments as may be necessary to reduce the\r\nprobable error of the mean of the differences below 0.001 inch. Under\r\nthese circumstances the mean difference of all the readings will be the\r\n_relative_ zero or index error, whence, if that of the intermediate\r\nbarometer be known, that of the other may be found. As such comparisons\r\nwill always be made when the vessel is in port, sufficient time can be\r\nallowed for making the requisite number of observations: hourly readings\r\nwould perhaps be best, and they would have the advantage of forming part\r\nof the system when in operation, and might be accordingly used as such.\r\n\r\nIt is not only desirable that the zero point of the barometer should be\r\nwell determined in the first instance; it should also be carefully\r\nverified on every opportunity which presents itself; and in every\r\ninstance, previous to sailing, it should be re-compared with the\r\nstandard on shore by the intervention of a portable barometer, and no\r\nopportunity should be lost of comparing it on the voyage by means of\r\nsuch an intermediate instrument with the standard barometers at St.\r\nHelena, the Cape of Good Hope, Bombay, Madras, Paramatta, Van Diemen's\r\nIsland, and with any other instruments likely to be referred to as\r\nstandards, or employed in research elsewhere. Any vessel having a\r\nportable barometer on board, the zero of which has been well determined,\r\nwould do well, on touching at any of the ports above named, to take\r\ncomparative readings with the standards at those ports, and record the\r\ndifferences between the standard, the portable, and the ship barometers.\r\nBy such means the zero of one standard may be transported over the whole\r\nworld, and those of others compared with it ascertained. To do so,\r\nhowever, with perfect effect, will require that the utmost care should\r\nbe taken of the portable barometer; it should be guarded as much as\r\npossible from all accident, and should be kept safely in the \"portable\"\r\nstate when not immediately used for comparison. To transport a\r\nwell-authenticated zero from place to place is by no means a point of\r\ntrifling importance. Neither should it be executed hurriedly nor\r\nnegligently. Some of the greatest questions in meteorology depend on its\r\ndue execution, and the objects for which these instructions have been\r\nprepared will be greatly advanced by the zero points of all barometers\r\nbeing referred to one common standard. Upon the arrival of the vessel in\r\nEngland, at the termination of the voyage, the ship's barometer should\r\nbe again compared with the same standard with which it was compared\r\nprevious to sailing; and should any difference be found, it should be\r\nmost carefully recorded.\r\n\r\nThe correction for the height of the cistern _above_ or _below_ the\r\nwater-line is _additive_ in the former case, _subtractive_ in the\r\nlatter. Its amount may be taken, nearly enough, by allowing 0·001 in. of\r\nthe barometer for each foot of difference of level.\r\n\r\nAn example of the application of these several corrections is\r\nsubjoined:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  |     _Attached Therm_. 54°·3.          |_Data for the correction of    |\r\n  |                                       |  the Instrument_.             |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------+\r\n  |Barometer reading.             29·409  |Neutral point           30·123 |\r\n  |Corr. for capacity             - ·017  |Capacity 1/42                  |\r\n  |                                       |Capillary action        + ·032 |\r\n  +---------------------------------------|                               |\r\n  |                               29·392  |Zero to Royal Society   + ·036 |\r\n  |Corr. for capillarity          + ·032  |Corr. for altitude above       |\r\n  |                                       |  water-line            + ·004 |\r\n  +---------------------------------------|                               |\r\n  |                               29·424  |                               |\r\n  |Corr. for temperature          - ·068  |                               |\r\n  +---------------------------------------|                               |\r\n  |                               29·356  |                               |\r\n  |Corr. for zero and water-line + ·040   |                               |\r\n  +---------------------------------------|                               |\r\n  |Aggregate = pressure at                |                               |\r\n  |  sea-level                    29·396  |                               |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+-------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would greatly facilitate the comparison of the barometric\r\nobservations by projecting them in curves when all the proper\r\ncorrections have been applied. This may be accomplished by a much\r\nsmaller expenditure of time than may at first be supposed. A paper of\r\nengraved squares on which the observations of twelve days may be laid\r\ndown on double the natural scale, would be very suitable for the\r\npurpose.[4] The projection of each day's observations would occupy but a\r\nshort time; and should circumstances on any occasion prevent the\r\nexecution of it, when the ship was becalmed or leisure otherwise\r\nafforded, it would form an interesting and useful occupation, and serve\r\nto beguile some of the tedium often experienced at such intervals.\r\n\r\n_Registers._--For the particular object in view the register need not be\r\nvery extensive. One kept in the annexed form will be amply sufficient.\r\nIt should, however, be borne in mind that none but _uncorrected_\r\nobservations should find admission; in point of fact it should be\r\nstrictly a register of phænomena as _observed_, and on no account\r\nwhatever should any entry be made from recollection, or any attempt made\r\nto fill up a blank by the apparent course of the numbers before and\r\nafter. The headings of the columns will, it is hoped, be sufficiently\r\nexplicit. It is desirable in practice that the column for remarks should\r\nembrace an entire page opposite the other entries, in order that\r\noccasional observations, as well as several other circumstances\r\ncontinually coming under review in the course of keeping a journal, may\r\nfind entry.\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL REGISTER kept on board ______ during her voyage from\r\n                  ______ to ______ by ______.\r\n\r\n  +---------+----+------+-------+------+------------------+--------+----------+\r\n  |         |    |      |       |      |        Wind.     |        |          |\r\n  |         |    |      |       | Att. |-----------+------|        |          |\r\n  |  Date.  |Lat.| Long.| Barom.| Ther.| Direction.|Force.| Remarks| Observer.|\r\n  |---------|----|------|-------|------|-----------|------|--------|----------|\r\n  |   |h. m.|    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  |   |     |    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  |   |     |    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  |   |     |    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  |   |     |    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  |   |     |    |      |       |      |           |      |        |          |\r\n  +---+-----+----+------+-------+------+-----------+------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the above form and one for the reception of\r\n_corrected_ readings will be the dispensing with the column for the\r\nattached thermometer, and placing under the word Barom. \"corrected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--TIMES OF OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the greatest amount of information, the\r\naccuracy of the data supplied, and in fact every meteorological element\r\nnecessary to increase our knowledge of atmospheric waves, may be best\r\nobtained by an uninterrupted series of _hourly_ observations made on\r\nboard vessels from their leaving England until their safe arrival again\r\nat the close of their respective voyages; but from a variety of\r\ncircumstances--the nature of the service in which the vessels may be\r\nemployed, particular states of the weather, &c.--such a course of\r\nunremitting labour cannot be expected; it is therefore necessary to fix\r\non some stated hours at which the instruments before particularized\r\nshould be regularly observed throughout the voyage, and their\r\nindications faithfully recorded. The hours of 3 A.M., 9 A.M., 3 P.M.,\r\nand 9 P.M., are now so generally known as _meteorological hours_, that\r\nnothing should justify a departure from them; and it is the more\r\nessential that these hours should be adopted in the present inquiry,\r\nbecause the series of observations made at intervals terminated by these\r\nhours can the more readily be used in connexion with those made\r\ncontemporaneously on land, and will also serve to carry on\r\ninvestigations previously instituted, and which have received\r\nconsiderable illustration by means of observations at the regular\r\nmeteorological hours; we therefore recommend their general adoption in\r\nall observations conducted at sea.\r\n\r\nIt is intended in the sequel to call attention to particular parts of\r\nthe earth's surface where it is desirable that additional observations\r\nshould be made, in order to furnish data of a more accurate character,\r\nand to mark more distinctly barometric changes than the four daily\r\nreadings are capable of effecting. The best means of accomplishing this\r\nfor the object in view appears to be the division of the interval of six\r\nhours into two equal portions, and to make the necessary observations\r\neight times in the course of twenty-four hours. In the particular\r\nlocalities to which allusion has been made we recommend the following as\r\nthe hours of observation:--\r\n\r\nA.M. 3, 6, 9, noon. P.M. 3, 6, 9, midnight.\r\n\r\nIn other localities besides those hereafter to be mentioned, when\r\nopportunities serve, readings at these hours would greatly enhance the\r\nvalue of the four daily readings.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, portions of the surface of our planet, and probably\r\nalso phænomena that occur in its atmosphere, which require still closer\r\nattention than the eight daily readings. One such portion would appear\r\nto exist off the western coast of Africa, and we recommend the adoption\r\nof _hourly_ readings while sailing to the westward of this junction of\r\naqueous and terrestrial surface; more attention will be directed to this\r\npoint as we proceed. There are also phænomena the localities of which\r\nmay be undetermined, and the times of their occurrence unknown, but so\r\nimportant a relation do they bear to the subject of our inquiries, that\r\nthey demand the closest attention. They will be more particularly\r\ndescribed under the head of accumulations of pressure preceding and\r\nsucceeding storms, and minute directions given for the hourly\r\nobservations of the necessary instruments. In the mean time we may here\r\nremark that hourly observations under the circumstances above alluded to\r\nare the more important when we consider that the barometer, the\r\ninstrument employed in observing these moving atmospheric masses, is\r\nitself in motion. The ship may meet the accumulation of pressure and\r\nsail through it transversely; or she may sail along it, the course of\r\nthe vessel being parallel to the line marking the highest pressure, the\r\nridge or crest of the wave; or the ship may make any angle with this\r\nline: but whatever the circumstances may be under which she passes\r\nthrough or along with such an accumulation of pressure, it should ever\r\nbe borne in mind that her position on the earth's surface is scarcely\r\never the same at any one observation as it was at the preceding, the\r\nbarometer in the interval has changed _its_ position as well as the line\r\nof maximum pressure, the rate of progress of which it is desirable to\r\nobserve. It will, therefore, be at once apparent that in order to obtain\r\nthe most accurate data on this head hourly observations are\r\nindispensable. To these readings should of course be appended the places\r\nof the ship from hour to hour, especially if she alter her course much.\r\n\r\nThere is another point to which we wish to call attention in immediate\r\nconnexion with hourly readings--it is the observation of the instruments\r\non the days fixed for that purpose: they were originally suggested by\r\nSir John Herschel, whose directions should be strictly attended to: they\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe days fixed upon for these observations are the 21st of March, the\r\n21st of June, the 21st of September, and the 21st of December, being\r\nthose, or immediately adjoining to those of the equinoxes and\r\nsolstices, in which the _solar influence_ is either stationary or in a\r\nstate of most rapid variation. _But should any one of those 21st days\r\nfall on a Sunday, then it will be understood that the observations are\r\nto be deferred till the next day, the 22nd._ The series of observations\r\non board each vessel should commence at 6 o'clock A.M. of the appointed\r\ndays, and terminate at 6 A.M. of the days following, according to the\r\nusual reckoning of time adopted in the daily observations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the twenty-five hourly readings at the solstices and\r\nequinoxes as above recommended, it would be desirable to continue the\r\nobservations until a complete elevation and depression of the barometer\r\nhad been observed at these seasons. This plan is adopted at the Royal\r\nObservatory, Greenwich, and would be attended with this advantage were\r\nit generally so--the progress of the elevation and depression would be\r\nmore readily traced and their velocities more accurately determined than\r\nfrom the four or eight daily readings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--LOCALITIES FOR ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn sketching out a system of barometric observation having especial\r\nreference to the acquisition of data from which the _barometric\r\ncharacter_ of certain large areas of the surface of the globe may be\r\ndetermined--inasmuch as such areas are distinguished from each other, on\r\nthe one hand by consisting of extensive spaces of the oceanic surface\r\nunbroken, or scarcely broken, by land; on the other by the proximity of\r\nsuch oceanic surface to large masses of land, and these masses\r\npresenting two essentially different features, the one consisting of\r\nland particularly characterized as continental, the other as insular,\r\nregard has been accordingly had to such distribution of land and water.\r\n\r\nAs these instructions have especial reference to observations at sea,\r\nobservations on land have not been alluded to; but in order that the\r\ndata accumulated may possess that value which is essential for carrying\r\non the inquiry in reference to atmospheric waves with success, provision\r\nis made to mark out more distinctly the barometric effects of the\r\njunction of large masses of land and water. It is well known that the\r\noceanic surface, and even the smaller surfaces of inland seas, produce\r\ndecided inflexions of the isothermal lines. They exercise an important\r\ninfluence on temperature. It has also been shown that the neighbourhood\r\nof water has a very considerable influence in increasing the\r\noscillations of the mercurial column in the barometer, and in the great\r\nsystems of European undulations it is well known that these oscillations\r\nincrease especially towards the north-west. The converse of this,\r\nhowever, has not yet been subjected to observation; there has been no\r\nsystematic co-operation of observers for the purpose of determining the\r\nbarometric affections of large masses of water, such as the central\r\nportion of the basin of the northern Atlantic, the portion of oceanic\r\nsurface between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, the Indian and\r\nSouthern oceans, and the vast basin of the Pacific. Nor are we yet\r\nacquainted with the character of the oscillations, whether increasing or\r\ndecreasing, as we recede from the central portions of the oceanic\r\nsurfaces we have mentioned towards the land which forms their eastern,\r\nwestern, or northern boundaries. This influence of the junction line of\r\nland and water, so far as it is yet known, has been kept in view in\r\nframing these instructions, and, as it appears so prominently in Europe,\r\nit is hoped the additional observations between the four daily readings\r\nto which probably many observers may habitually restrict themselves,\r\nmaking on certain occasions and in particular localities a series of\r\nobservations at intervals of three hours, will not be considered too\r\nfrequent when the great importance of the problem to be solved is fully\r\napprehended. It need scarcely be said that the value of these\r\nobservations at three-hourly intervals will be greatly increased by the\r\nnumber of observers co-operating in them. Upon such an extensive system\r\nof co-operation a large space on the earth's surface, possessing\r\npeculiarities which distinguish it from others extremely unlike it in\r\ntheir general character, or assimilate it to such as possess with it\r\nmany features in common, is marked out below for particular observation,\r\noccupying more than two-thirds of a zone in the northern hemisphere,\r\nhaving a breadth of 40°, and including every possible variety of\r\nterrestrial and aqueous surface, from the burning sands of the great\r\nAfrican desert, situated about the centre, to the narrow strip of land\r\nconnecting the two Americas on the one side, and the chain of islands\r\nconnecting China and Hindostan with Australia on the other. On each side\r\nof the African continent we have spaces of open sea between 30° and 40°\r\nwest longitude north of the equator, and between 60° and 80° east\r\nlongitude, in or to the south of the equator, admirably suited for\r\ncontrasting the barometric affections, as manifested in these spaces of\r\nopen water, with those occurring in situations where the influence of\r\nthe terrestrial surface comes into more active operation.\r\n\r\nThe localities where three-hourly readings are chiefly desirable may be\r\nspecified under the heads of _Northern Atlantic, Southern Atlantic,\r\nIndian_ and _Southern Oceans,_ and _Pacific Ocean_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northern Atlantic. Homeward-bound Voyages._--The discussion of\r\nobservations made in the United Kingdom and the western border of\r\ncentral Europe, has indicated that off the north-west of Scotland a\r\ncentre of great barometric disturbance exists. This centre of\r\ndisturbance appears to be considerably removed from the usual tracks of\r\nvessels crossing the Atlantic; nevertheless some light may be thrown on\r\nthe barometric phænomena resulting from this disturbance by observations\r\nduring homeward-bound voyages, especially after the vessels have passed\r\nthe meridian of 50° west longitude. Voyagers to or from Baffin and\r\nHudson bays would do well during the whole of the voyage to read off the\r\nbarometer every three hours, as their tracks would approach nearest the\r\ncentre of disturbance in question. Before crossing the 50th meridian,\r\nthe undulations arising from the distribution of land and water in the\r\nneighbourhood of these vast inland seas would receive considerable\r\nelucidation from the shorter intervals of observation, and after passing\r\nthe 50th meridian the extent of undulation, as compared with that\r\nobserved by the more southerly vessels, would be more distinctly marked\r\nby the three-hourly series. Surveying vessels stationed on the\r\nnorth-western coasts of Ireland and Scotland may contribute most\r\nimportant information on this head by a regular and, as far as\r\ncircumstances will allow, an uninterrupted series either of six-hourly\r\nor three-hourly observations. The intervals of observation on board\r\nvessels stationed at the Western Isles, the Orkneys, and the Shetland\r\nIsles, ought not to be longer than _three_ hours, principally on account\r\nof the great extent of oscillation observed in those localities. Vessels\r\narriving from all parts of the world as they approach the United Kingdom\r\nshould observe at shorter intervals than six hours. As a general\r\ninstruction on this head the series of three-hourly observations may be\r\ncommenced on board vessels from America and the Pacific by the way of\r\nCape Horn on their passing the 20th meridian, such three-hourly\r\nobservations to be continued until the arrival of the vessels in port.\r\nShips by the way of the Cape of Good Hope should commence the\r\nthree-hourly series either on leaving or passing the colony, in order\r\nthat the phænomena of the tropical depression hereafter to be noticed\r\nmay be well observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northern Atlantic. Outward-bound Voyages_.--Vessels sailing to the\r\nUnited States, Mexico, and the West Indies, should observe at three\r\nhours' interval upon passing the 60th meridian. Observations at this\r\ninterval, on board vessels navigating the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nCaribbean Sea, will be particularly valuable in determining the extent\r\nof oscillation as influenced by the masses of land and water in this\r\nportion of the torrid zone, as compared with the oscillation noticed off\r\nthe western coast of Africa, hereafter to be referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southern Atlantic. Outward and homeward bound_.--Without doubt the most\r\ninteresting phænomenon, and one that lies at the root of the great\r\natmospheric movements, especially those proceeding northwards in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere and southwards in the southern, is the equatorial\r\ndepression first noticed by Von Humboldt and confirmed by many observers\r\nsince. We shall find the general expression of this most important\r\nmeteorological fact in the Report of the Committee of Physics and\r\nMeteorology, appointed by the Royal Society in 1840, as follows: \"The\r\nbarometer, at the level of the sea, does not indicate a mean atmospheric\r\npressure of equal amount in all parts of the earth; but, on the\r\ncontrary, the equatorial pressure is uniformly less in its mean amount\r\nthan at and beyond the tropics.\" Vessels that are outward bound should,\r\nupon passing 40° north latitude, commence the series of three-hourly\r\nobservations, with an especial reference to the equatorial depression.\r\nThese three-hourly observations should be continued until the latitude\r\nof 40° south has been passed: the whole series will then include the\r\nminimum of the depression and the two maxima or apices forming its\r\nboundaries. (See Daniell's 'Meteorological Essays,' 3rd edition.) In\r\npassages across the equator, should the ships be delayed by calms,\r\nopportunities should be embraced for observing this depression with\r\ngreater precision by means of _hourly_ readings; and these readings will\r\nnot only be valuable as respects the depression here spoken of, but will\r\ngo far to indicate the character of any disturbance that may arise, and\r\npoint out, as nearly as such observations will allow, the precise time\r\nwhen such disturbance produced its effects in the neighbourhood of the\r\nships. In point of fact they will clearly illustrate the diversion of\r\nthe tendency to rise, spoken of in the Report before alluded to, as\r\nresulting in ascending columns and sheets, between which wind flaws,\r\ncapricious in their direction and intensity, and often amounting to\r\nsharp squalls, mark out the course of their feeders and the indraft of\r\ncooler air from a distance to supply their void. Hourly observations,\r\nwith especial reference to this and the following head of inquiry,\r\nshould also be made off the western coast of Africa during the\r\nhomeward-bound voyage.\r\n\r\nImmediately connected with this part of the outward-bound voyage, hourly\r\nobservations, as often as circumstances will permit, while the ships are\r\nsailing from the Madeiras to the equator, will be extremely valuable in\r\nelucidating the origin of the great system of south-westerly atmospheric\r\nwaves that traverse Europe, and in furnishing data for comparison with\r\nthe amount of oscillation and other barometric phænomena in the Gulf of\r\nMexico and the Caribbean Sea, a portion of the torrid zone essentially\r\ndifferent in its configuration and in the relations of its area to land\r\nand water, as contra-distinguished to the northern portion of the\r\nAfrican continent; and these hourly observations are the more desirable\r\nas the vessels may approach the land. They may be discontinued on\r\npassing the equator, and the three-hourly series resumed.\r\n\r\nThere are two points in the southern hemisphere, between 80° west\r\nlongitude and 30° east longitude, that claim particular attention in a\r\nbarometric point of view, viz., Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope; the\r\nlatter is within the area marked out for the three-hourly observations,\r\nand too much attention cannot be paid to the indications of the\r\nbarometer as vessels are approaching or leaving the Cape. The northern\r\npart of the South Atlantic Ocean has been termed the _true Pacific Ocean\r\nof the world_; and at St. Helena a gale was scarcely ever known; it is\r\nalso said to be entirely free from actual storms (Col. Reid's 'Law of\r\nStorms,' 1st edition, p. 415). It may therefore be expected that the\r\nbarometer will present in this locality but a small oscillation, and\r\nships in sailing from St. Helena to the Cape will do well to ascertain,\r\nby means of the three-hourly observations, the increase of oscillation\r\nas they approach the Cape. The same thing will hold good with regard to\r\nCape Horn: it appears from previous observation that a permanent\r\nbarometric depression exists in this locality, most probably in some way\r\nconnected with the immense depression noticed by Captain Sir James Clark\r\nRoss, towards the Antarctic Circle. The general character of the\r\natmosphere off Cape Horn is also extremely different from its character\r\nat St. Helena. It would therefore be well for vessels sailing into the\r\nPacific by Cape Horn, to continue the three-hourly observations until\r\nthe 90th meridian is passed.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Atlantic Ocean it may be well to notice the marine\r\nstations mentioned in my Third Report on Atmospheric Waves,[5] as being\r\nparticularly suitable for testing the views advanced in that report and\r\nfor tracing a wave of the south-westerly system from the most western\r\npoint of Africa to the extreme north of Europe. A series of hourly\r\nobservations off the western coast of Africa has already been suggested.\r\nVessels staying at Cape Verd Islands should not omit to make\r\nobservations at three hours' interval _during the whole of their stay_,\r\nand when circumstances will allow, hourly readings. At the Canaries,\r\nMadeiras, and the Azores, similar observations should be made. Vessels\r\ntouching at Cape Cantin, Tangier, Gibraltar, Cadiz, Lisbon, Oporto,\r\nCorunna, and Brest, should also make these observations while they are\r\nin the localities of these ports. At the Scilly Isles we have six-hourly\r\nobservations, made under the superintendence of the Honourable the\r\nCorporation of the Trinity House. Ships in nearing these islands and\r\nmaking the observations already pointed out, will greatly assist in\r\ndetermining the increase of oscillation proceeding westward from the\r\nnodal point of the two great European systems. We have already mentioned\r\nthe service surveying vessels employed on the coasts of Ireland and\r\nScotland may render, and the remaining portion of the area marked out in\r\nthe report may be occupied by vessels navigating the North Sea and the\r\ncoast of Norway, as far as Hammerfest.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with these observations, having especial reference to the\r\nEuropean system of south-westerly atmospheric waves, the Mediterranean\r\npresents a surface of considerable interest, both as regards these\r\nparticular waves, and the influence its waters exert in modifying the\r\ntwo great systems of central Europe. The late Professor Daniell has\r\nshown from the Manheim observations, that small undulations, having\r\ntheir origin on the northern borders of the Mediterranean, have\r\npropagated themselves northward, and in this manner, but in a smaller\r\ndegree, the waters of the Mediterranean have contributed to increase the\r\noscillation as well as the larger surface of the northern Atlantic. In\r\nmost of the localities of this great inland sea six-hourly observations\r\nmay suffice for this immediate purpose; but in sailing from Lisbon\r\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar, in the neighbourhood of Sicily and\r\nItaly, and in the Grecian Archipelago, we should recommend the\r\nthree-hourly series, as marking more distinctly the effects resulting\r\nfrom the proximity of land; this remark has especial reference to the\r\npassage through the Straits of Gibraltar, where, if possible, hourly\r\nobservations should be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Indian and Southern Oceans. Outward and homeward bound._--On\r\nsailing from the Cape of Good Hope to the East Indies, China, or\r\nAustralia, observations at intervals of three hours should be made until\r\nthe 40th meridian east is passed (homeward-bound vessels should commence\r\nthe three-hourly readings on arriving at this meridian). Upon leaving\r\nthe 40th meridian the six-hourly observations may be resumed on board\r\nvessels bound for the Indies and China until they arrive at the equator,\r\nwhen the readings should again be made at intervals of three hours, and\r\ncontinued until the arrival of the vessels in port. With regard to\r\nvessels bound for Australia and New Zealand, the six-hourly readings may\r\nbe continued from the 40th to the 100th meridian, and upon the vessels\r\npassing the latter, the three-hourly readings should be commenced and\r\ncontinued until the vessels arrive in port. Vessels navigating the\r\nArchipelago between China and New Zealand, should make observations\r\nevery three hours, in order that the undulations arising from the\r\nconfiguration of the terrestrial and oceanic surfaces may be more\r\ndistinctly marked and more advantageously compared with the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the northern portion of the African\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pacific Ocean._--As this ocean presents so vast an aqueous surface,\r\ngenerally speaking observations at intervals of six hours will be amply\r\nsufficient to ascertain its leading barometric phænomena. Vessels,\r\nhowever, on approaching the continents of North and South America, or\r\nsailing across the equator, should resort to the three-hourly readings,\r\nin order to ascertain more distinctly the effect of the neighbourhood of\r\nland on the oscillations of the barometer, as generally observed, over\r\nso immense a surface of water in the one case, and the phænomena of the\r\nequatorial depression in the other: the same remarks relative to the\r\nlatter subject, which we offered under the head of South Atlantic, will\r\nequally apply in the present instance. The configuration of the western\r\nshores of North America renders it difficult to determine the precise\r\nboundary where the three-hourly series should commence; the 90th\r\nmeridian is recommended for the boundary as regards South America, and\r\nfrom this a judgment may be formed as to where the three-hourly\r\nobservations should commence in reference to North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous sketch of the localities for the more important\r\nobservations, it will be seen that within the tropics there are three\r\nwhich demand the greatest regard.\r\n\r\nI. The Archipelago between the two Americas, more particularly comprised\r\nwithin the 40th and 120th meridians west longitude, and the equator and\r\nthe 40th degree of north latitude. As a general principle we should say\r\nthat vessels within this area should observe the barometer every three\r\nhours. Its eastern portion includes the lower branches of the storm\r\npaths, and on this account is peculiarly interesting, especially in a\r\nbarometric point of view.\r\n\r\nII. _The Northern portion of the African Continent, including the Sahara\r\nor Great Desert._--This vast radiating surface must exert considerable\r\ninfluence on the waters on each side northern Africa. Vessels sailing\r\nwithin the area comprised between 40° west and 70° east, and the equator\r\nand the 40th parallel, should also make observations at intervals of\r\nthree hours.\r\n\r\nIII. _The great Eastern Archipelago._--This presents a somewhat similar\r\ncharacter to the western; like that, it is the region of terrific\r\nhurricanes, and it becomes a most interesting object to determine its\r\nbarometric phænomena; the three-hourly system of observation may\r\ntherefore be resorted to within an area comprised between the 70th and\r\n140th meridians, and the equator and the 40th degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nThe southern hemisphere also presents three important localities, the\r\nprolongations of the three tropical areas. It is unnecessary to enlarge\r\nupon these, as ample instructions have been already given. We may,\r\nhowever, remark, with regard to Australia, that three-hourly\r\nobservations should be made within the area comprised between the 100th\r\nand 190th meridians east, and the equator and the 50th parallel south,\r\nand hourly ones in the immediate neighbourhood of all its coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--STORMS, HURRICANES, AND TYPHOONS.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the question--How far and in what manner are storms\r\nconnected with atmospheric waves?--must be extremely interesting to\r\nevery one engaged in either the naval or merchant service. As we have in\r\nthe former chapters directed attention to their connexion, our great\r\nobject here will be to endeavour to mark out such a line of observation\r\nas appears most capable of throwing light, not only on the most\r\nimportant desiderata as connected with storms, but also their connexion\r\nor non-connexion with atmospheric waves. We shall accordingly\r\narrange this portion of the instructions under the following\r\nheads:--_Desiderata_; _Localities_; _Margins_; _Preceding and Succeeding\r\nAccumulations of Pressure._\r\n\r\n_Desiderata._--The most important desiderata appertaining to the subject\r\nof storms, are certainly their origin and termination. Of these initial\r\nand terminal points in the course of great storms we absolutely know\r\nnothing, unless _the white appearance of a round form_ observed by Mr.\r\nSeymour on board the Judith and Esther, in lat. 17° 19' north and long.\r\n52° 10' west (see Col. Reid's 'Law of Storms,' 1st edit. p. 65), may be\r\nregarded as the commencement of the Antigua hurricane of August 2, 1837.\r\nThis vessel was the most eastern of those from which observations had\r\nbeen obtained; and it is the absence of contemporaneous observations to\r\nthe eastward of the 50th meridian that leaves the question as to the\r\norigin of the West Indian revolving storms unsolved. Not one of Mr.\r\nRedfield's storm routes extends eastward of the 50th meridian; this at\r\nonce marks out, so far as storms are concerned, the entire space\r\nincluded between the 20th and 50th meridians, the equator and the 60th\r\nparallel, as a most suitable area for observations, under particular\r\ncircumstances hereafter to be noticed, with especial reference either to\r\nthe commencement or termination of storms, or the prolongation of Mr.\r\nRedfield's storm paths.\r\n\r\n_Localities._--The three principal localities of storms are as\r\nfollows:--I. The western portion of the basin of the North Atlantic; II.\r\nThe China Sea and Bay of Bengal; and III. The Indian Ocean, more\r\nparticularly in the neighbourhood of Mauritius. The first two have\r\nalready been marked out as areas for the three-hourly observations; to\r\nthe latter, the remark as to extra observations under the head of\r\nDesiderata will apply.\r\n\r\n_Margins._--Mr. Redfield has shown that on some occasions storms have\r\nbeen preceded by an unusual pressure of the atmosphere; the barometer\r\nhas stood remarkably _high_, and it has hence been inferred that there\r\nhas existed _around_ the gale an accumulation of air forming a margin;\r\nbarometers placed under this margin indicating a much greater pressure\r\nthan the mean of the respective localities. With regard to the West\r\nIndian and American hurricanes--any considerable increase of pressure,\r\nespecially within the space marked out to the eastward of the 50th\r\nmeridian, will demand immediate attention. Upon the barometer ranging\r\n_very high_ within this space, three-hourly observations should be\r\nimmediately resorted to; and if possible, _hourly_ readings taken, and\r\nthis is the more important the nearer the vessel may be to the 50th\r\nmeridian. Each observation of the barometer should be accompanied by an\r\nobservation of the wind--its direction should be most carefully noted,\r\nand the force estimated according to the scale in page 21, or by the\r\nanemometer. It would be as well _at the time_ to project the barometric\r\nreadings in a curve even of a rough character, that the extent of fall\r\nafter the mercury had passed its maximum might be readily discernible by\r\nthe eye. A paper ruled in squares, the vertical lines representing the\r\ncommencement of hours, and the horizontal tenths of an inch, would be\r\nquite sufficient for this purpose. The _force_ of the wind should be\r\nnoted at, or as near to the time of the passage of the maximum as\r\npossible. During the fall of the mercury particular attention should be\r\npaid to the manner in which the wind changes, should any change be\r\nobserved; and should the wind continue blowing steadily in _one_\r\ndirection, but gradually _increasing_ in force, then such increments of\r\nforce should be most carefully noted. During the fall of the barometer,\r\nshould the changes of the wind and its increasing force indicate the\r\nneighbourhood of a revolving storm, (independent of the obvious reasons\r\nfor avoiding the focus of the storm,) it would contribute as much to\r\nincrease our knowledge of these dangerous vortices to keep as near as\r\npossible to their margins as to approach their centres. The recess from\r\nthe centre towards the margin of the storm, will probably be rendered\r\napparent by the _rising_ of the mercury; and so far as the observations\r\nmay be considered valuable for elucidating the connexion of atmospheric\r\nwaves with rotatory storms (other motives being balanced), it might be\r\ndesirable to keep the ship near the margin--provided she is not carried\r\nbeyond the influence of the winds which characterize the latter half of\r\nthe storm--until the barometer has nearly attained its usual elevation.\r\nBy this means some notion might be formed of the general direction of\r\nthe line of barometric pressure preceding or succeeding a storm.\r\n\r\nShould a gale be observed commencing without its having been preceded by\r\nan unusual elevation of the mercurial column, and consequently no\r\nadditional observation have been made; when the force of the wind is\r\nnoted in the usual observations at or above 5, then the three-hourly\r\nseries should be resorted to, and the same care taken in noting the\r\ndirection, changes, and force of the wind as pointed out in the\r\npreceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks relate especially to the central and western\r\nportions of the North Atlantic; they will however equally apply to the\r\nremaining localities of storms. Under any circumstances, and in any\r\nlocality, a _high_ barometer not less than a low one should demand\r\nparticular attention, and if possible, _hourly_ readings taken some time\r\nbefore and after the passage of the maximum: this will be referred to\r\nmore particularly under the next head.\r\n\r\n_Preceding and Succeeding Accumulations of Pressure._--Mr. Redfield has\r\nshown in his Memoir of the Cuba Hurricane of October, 1844, that two\r\nassociated storms were immediately preceded by a barometric wave, or\r\naccumulation of pressure, the barometer rising above the usual or annual\r\nmean. We have just referred to the importance of _hourly_ observations\r\non occasions of the readings being _high_ as capable of illustrating the\r\nmarginal phænomena of storms, and in connexion with these accumulations\r\nof pressure in advance of storms we would reiterate the suggestion.\r\nThese strips of accumulated pressure are doubtless crests of atmospheric\r\nwaves rolling forwards. In some cases a ship in its progress may cut\r\nthem transversely in a direction at right angles to their _length_, in\r\nothers very obliquely; but in all cases, whatever section may be given\r\nby the curve representing the observations, too much attention cannot be\r\nbestowed on the barometer, the wet and dry bulb thermometer, the\r\ndirection and force of the wind, the state of the sky, and the\r\nappearance of the ocean during the ship's passage _through_ such an\r\naccumulation of pressure. When the barometer attains its mean altitude,\r\nand is rapidly rising above it in any locality, then _hourly_\r\nobservations of the instruments and phænomena above noticed should be\r\ncommenced and continued until after the mercury had attained its highest\r\npoint and had sunk again to its mean state. In such observations\r\nparticular attention should be paid to the direction and force of the\r\nwind preceding the barometric maximum--and the same phænomena succeeding\r\nit, and particular notice should be taken of the time when, and amount\r\nof any change either in the direction or force of the wind. It is by\r\nsuch observations as these, carried on with great care and made at every\r\naccessible portion of the oceanic surface, that we may be able to\r\nascertain the continuity of these atmospheric waves, to determine\r\nsomewhat respecting their length, to show the character of their\r\nconnexion with the rotatory storm, and to deduce the direction and rate\r\nof their progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--SEASONS FOR EXTRA OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn reference to certain desiderata that have presented themselves in the\r\ncourse of my researches on this subject (see Report of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, 1846, p. 163), the _phases_\r\nof the larger barometric undulations, and the _types_ of the various\r\nseasons of the year, demand particular attention and call for extra\r\nobservations at certain seasons: of these, three only have yet been\r\nascertained--the type for the middle of November--the annual depression\r\non or about the 28th of November--and the annual elevation on or about\r\nthe 25th of December. The enunciation of the first is as under: \"That\r\nduring fourteen days in November, more or less equally disposed about\r\nthe middle of the month, the oscillations of the barometer exhibit a\r\nremarkably symmetrical character, that is to say, the fall succeeding\r\nthe transit of the maximum or the highest reading is to a great extent\r\nsimilar to the preceding rise. This rise and fall is not continuous or\r\nunbroken; in some cases it consists of _five_, in others of _three_\r\ndistinct elevations. The complete rise and fall has been termed the\r\ngreat symmetrical barometric wave of November. At its setting in the\r\nbarometer is generally low, sometimes below twenty-nine inches. This\r\ndepression is generally succeeded by _two_ well-marked undulations,\r\nvarying from one to two days in duration. The central undulation, which\r\nalso forms the apex of the great wave, is of larger extent, occupying\r\nfrom three to five days; when this has passed, two smaller undulations\r\ncorresponding to those at the commencement of the wave make their\r\nappearance, and at the close of the last the wave terminates.\" With but\r\nslight exceptions, the observations of eight successive years have\r\nconfirmed the general correctness of this type. On two occasions the\r\ncentral apex has not been the highest, and these deviations, with some\r\nof a minor character, form the exceptions alluded to. This type only has\r\nreference to London and the south-eastern parts of England; proceeding\r\nwestward, north-westward, and northward, the symmetrical character of\r\nthis type is considerably departed from; each locality possessing its\r\nown type of the barometric movements during November. The desiderata in\r\nimmediate connexion with the November movements, as observed in the\r\nsouthern and south-eastern parts of England, that present themselves,\r\nare--the determination of the types for November, especially its middle\r\nportion, as exhibited on the oceanic surface within an area comprised\r\nbetween the 30th and 60th parallels, and the 1st and 40th meridians\r\nwest. Vessels sailing within this area may contribute greatly to the\r\ndetermination of these types by making observations at intervals of\r\nthree hours from the 1st of November to the 7th or 8th of December. The\r\nentire period of the great symmetrical wave of November will most\r\nprobably be embraced by such a series of observations, as well as the\r\nannual depression of the 28th. For the elevation of the 25th of December\r\nthe three-hourly observations should be commenced on the 21st, and\r\ncontinued until the 3rd or 4th of the succeeding January.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the great wave of November, our knowledge of it would be\r\nmuch increased by such a series of observations as mentioned above,\r\nbeing made on board surveying and other vessels employed off Scotland\r\nand Ireland; vessels navigating the North Sea; vessels stationed off the\r\ncoasts of France, Spain, Portugal, and the northern parts of Africa, and\r\nat all our stations in the Mediterranean. In this way the area of\r\nexamination would be greatly enlarged, and the _differences_ of the\r\ncurves more fully elucidated; and this extended area of observation is\r\nthe more desirable, as there is some reason to believe that the line of\r\ngreatest symmetry _revolves_ around a fixed point, most probably the\r\nnodal point of the great European systems.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that movements of a somewhat similar character,\r\nalthough presenting very different curves, exist in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The November wave is more or less associated with storms. It\r\nhas been generally preceded by a high barometer and succeeded by a low\r\none, and this low state of the barometer has been accompanied by stormy\r\nweather. We are therefore prepared to seek for similar phænomena in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, in those localities which present similar states of\r\nweather, and at seasons when such weather predominates. We have already\r\nmarked out the two capes in the Southern hemisphere for three-hourly\r\nobservations: they must doubtless possess very peculiar barometric\r\ncharacters, stretching as they do into the vast area of the Southern\r\nOcean. It is highly probable that the oscillations, especially at some\r\nseasons, are very considerable, and vessels visiting them at such\r\nseasons would do well to record with especial care the indications of\r\nthe instruments already alluded to. At present we know but little of the\r\nbarometric movements in the Southern hemisphere, and every addition to\r\nour knowledge in this respect will open the way to more important\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in the south-east of England that the barometer has\r\ngenerally passed a maximum on or about the 3rd of every month, and this\r\nhas been so frequently the case as to form the rule rather than the\r\nexception. The same fact during a more limited period has been observed\r\nat Toronto. With especial reference to this subject the three-hourly\r\nseries of observations may be resorted to in all localities, but\r\nespecially north of the 40th parallel in the northern hemisphere. They\r\nshould be commenced at midnight immediately preceding the 1st and\r\ncontinued to midnight succeeding the 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL DIRECTIONS FOR AVOIDING THE CENTRES OF ROTATING\r\nSTORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures 1 and 2, enlarged and printed on narrow rings of stiff\r\ncardboard, are employed for this purpose. The letters outside the thick\r\ncircle are intended to distinguish the points of the compass, and in use\r\nshould always coincide with those points on the chart. The letters\r\nwithin the thick circle indicate the direction of the wind in a\r\nhurricane, the whirl being shown by the arrows between the letters. In\r\nthe northern hemisphere the direction of the whirl is always contrary to\r\nthat in which the hands of a watch move, and in the southern coincident\r\nthereto. The graduation is intended to assist the mariner in\r\nascertaining the bearing of the centre of a storm from his ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use._\r\n\r\nAt any time when a severe gale or hurricane is expected, the seaman\r\nshould at once find the position of his ship on the chart, and place\r\nupon it the graduated point which answers to the direction of the wind\r\nat the time, taking care that the needle is directed to the north, so\r\nthat the exterior letters may point on the chart to the respective\r\npoints of the compass: this is very essential. This simple process will\r\nat once acquaint the seaman with two important facts relative to the\r\ncoming hurricane--his position in the storm, and the direction in\r\nwhich it is moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examples._\r\n\r\nA captain of a ship in latitude 35° 24' N., longitude 64° 12' W., bound\r\nto the United States, observes the barometer to stand unusually high,\r\nsay 30·55 inches: shortly after the mercury begins to fall, at first\r\nslowly and steadily; as the glass falls the wind freshens, and is\r\nnoticed to blow with increasing force from the S. so as to threaten a\r\ngale. The position of the ship on the chart is now to be found, and the\r\ngraduated point under the letters E. S. is to be placed thereon,\r\ntaking care to direct the needle to the north. From these two\r\ncircumstances, the falling barometer and the wind blowing from the south\r\nwith increasing force, the mariner is aware of this simple fact, that he\r\nis situated in the advancing portion of a body of air which is\r\nproceeding towards the N.E.; and if he turn his face to the N.E. he will\r\nfind he is on the right of the axis line, or line cutting the advancing\r\nbody transversely. The hurricane circle as it lies on the chart reveals\r\nto him another important fact, which is, that if he pursue his course he\r\nwill sail _towards_ the axis line of the hurricane, and may stand a\r\nchance of foundering in its centre. To avoid this he has one of two\r\ncourses to adopt; either to lay-to on the _starboard tack_, according to\r\nCol. Reid's rules (see his 'Law of Storms,' 1st edit., pp. 425 to 428),\r\nthe ship being in the right-hand semicircle of the hurricane, or so to\r\nalter his course as to keep without the influence of the storm. In the\r\npresent case the adoption of the latter alternative would involve a\r\nreversal of his former course; nevertheless it is clear the more he\r\nbears to the S.E. the less he will experience the violence of the\r\nhurricane: should he heave his ship to, upon moving the hurricane circle\r\nfrom the ship's place on the chart towards the N.E., he will be able to\r\njudge of the changes of the wind he is likely to experience: thus it\r\nwill first veer to S.S.W., the barometer still falling; then to S.W.,\r\nthe barometer at a minimum--this marks the position of the most violent\r\nportion of the storm he may be in, and by keeping the barometer as high\r\nas he can by bearing towards the S.E., the farther he will be from the\r\ncentre--the barometer now begins to rise, the wind veering to W.S.W.,\r\nand the hurricane finally passes off with the wind at W. It is to be\r\nparticularly remarked that in this example the ship is in the _most\r\ndangerous quadrant_, as by scudding she would be driven in advance of\r\nthe track of the storm's centre, which of course would be approaching\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the hurricane sets in at the ship's place with the wind at\r\nS.E., the proceeding will be altogether different. At first the wind is\r\nfair for the prosecution of the voyage, and it is desirable to take\r\nadvantage of this fair wind to avoid as much as possible the track of\r\nthe centre, which passes over the ship's place in this instance, and is\r\nalways the most dangerous part of the storm. As the ship is able to make\r\ngood distance from this track by bearing towards the N.W., provided she\r\nhas plenty of sea-room, she will experience less of the violence of the\r\nhurricane; but as most of the Atlantic storms sweep over the shore, it\r\nwill be desirable to lay-to at some point on the _larboard tack_, the\r\nship being now in the left-hand semicircle. By moving the circle as\r\nbefore directed it will be seen that the veering of the wind is now\r\nE.S.E., E., E.N.E., N.E., the lowest barometer N.N.E., N., and N.N.W.,\r\nthe ship experiencing more or less of these changes as it is nearer to\r\nor farther from the axis line.\r\n\r\nIn latitudes lower than 20° N. the Atlantic hurricanes usually move\r\ntowards the N.W. Taking the same positions of our ship with regard to\r\nthe storms as in the two former examples, if the storm set in with the\r\nwind E. the proper proceeding is to bear away for the N.E., the most\r\ndangerous quadrant of the hurricane having overtaken the ship, the\r\nveering of the wind if she is lying-to will be E., E.S.E., S.E., with\r\nthe lowest barometer S.S.E. and S. Should the storm set in at N.E., her\r\nposition at the time will be some indication of the distance of the\r\ncentre's track from the nearest land, and will greatly assist in\r\ndetermining the point at which the captain ought to lay-to after taking\r\nadvantage of the N.E. wind, should he be able so to do, to bear away\r\nfrom the centre line, so as to avoid as much as possible the violence of\r\nthe storm. From the proximity of the West Indian Islands to this\r\nlocality of the storm-paths, the danger is proportionally increased.\r\n\r\nThe above examples have reference only to the lower and upper branches\r\nof the storm paths of the Northern Atlantic in the neighbourhood of the\r\nWest Indies and the United States. In latitudes from about 25° to 32°\r\nthese paths usually _re-curve_, and at some point will move towards the\r\nnorth. The veering of the wind will consequently be more or less\r\ncomplicated according as the ship may be nearer to or farther from the\r\ncentre. The tables on page 11, combined with the first of those\r\nimmediately following the next paragraph, will, it is hoped, prove\r\nadvantageous in assisting the mariner as to the course to be adopted. As\r\na general principle we should say it would be best to bear to the\r\neastward, so as not only to avoid the greater fury of the storm, but to\r\nget into the S. and S.W. winds, which give the principal chances of\r\nmaking a westerly course.\r\n\r\nWe have in page 44 called attention to the fact that the storm paths\r\ntraced by Mr. Redfield do not extend eastward of the 50th meridian. This\r\nby no means precludes the existence of severe storms and those of a\r\nrotatory character in the great basin of the Northern Atlantic,\r\nespecially between the 40th and 50th parallels. A remarkable instance\r\nhas come under the author's attention of the wind hauling _apparently_\r\ncontrary to the usual theory: it may be that the storm route was in a\r\ndirection not generally observed. We are at the present moment destitute\r\nof any information that at all indicates a _reversion_ of the rotation\r\nin either hemisphere. The following tables constructed for the northern\r\nhemisphere, and for storm routes _not yet ascertained_, may probably be\r\nconsulted with advantage on anomalous occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHURRICANE

CLOWES AND SONS, STANFORD STREET. FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The first half of the storm, _in the case before alluded to_, is\r\nthat N.E. of the line N.W.--S.E., fig. 1, comprising the easterly and\r\nsoutherly winds; and the latter half, that S.W. of the same line,\r\ncomprising the northerly and westerly winds.\r\n\r\n[2] This table is also applicable to the hurricanes in the neighbourhood\r\nof Mauritius in the southern hemisphere, where all the phænomena are\r\nreversed; the motion of the hurricanes being towards the S.W., and the\r\nrotation in the direction of the hands of a watch, the same barometric\r\nand anemonal phænomena are experienced as in a hurricane in the northern\r\nhemisphere moving towards the N.E.\r\n\r\n[3] By the officer of the watch being charged with this duty, and its\r\nbeing executed under his immediate superintendence, it is apprehended\r\nthat a register may be kept with great regularity.\r\n\r\n[4] These papers may be obtained from Messrs. W. H. Allen and Co.,\r\nBooksellers to the Honourable East India Company, No. 7, Leadenhall\r\nStreet, London.\r\n\r\n[5] Reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,\r\n1846, p. 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Hurricane Guide, by William Radcliff Birt",
