This constitutes the third in the\r\n    series of fruit publications that is being prepared under your\r\n    authority.\r\n\r\n    The data embodied in the volume are the result of\r\n    long-continued studies and observations at this institution\r\n    as well as throughout the State, to which has been added a\r\n    large amount of information that commercial plum-growers have\r\n    very kindly furnished. The attempt has been made to produce a\r\n    monograph including all the cultivated plums, and it is hoped\r\n    that the result will be recognized as a worthy advance in the\r\n    literature of this class of fruits.\r\n\r\n                                                       W. H. JORDAN,\r\n                                                       _Director._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Plums of New York_ is the third monograph of the fruits of this\r\nregion published by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station. The\r\naims of these books have been stated in full in _The Grapes of New York_,\r\nbut it is considered best to re-state some of these briefly and to\r\nindicate some features in which the book on plums differs from the one on\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the aim has been to make _The Plums of New York_ a\r\nrecord of our present knowledge of cultivated plums. The book has been\r\nwritten for New York but its contents are so general in character that\r\nthe work applies to the whole country and more or less to the world. The\r\nfirst chapter is a historical account and a botanical classification of\r\nplums; the second, a discussion of the present status of plum-growing\r\nin America; while the third and fourth are devoted to varieties of\r\nplums. The first and last two of these chapters contain the synonymy and\r\nbibliography of the species and varieties of plums. In the foot-notes\r\nrunning through the book biographical sketches are given of the persons\r\nwho have contributed most to plum culture in America; here may be found\r\nalso matters pertaining to plums not properly included in the text but\r\nnecessary for its best understanding. Important varieties, so considered\r\nfrom various standpoints, with the bark and the flowers of several\r\nspecies, are illustrated in colors.\r\n\r\n_The Plums of New York_ is a horticultural and not a botanical work.\r\nBut in a study of the fruit from a horticultural standpoint one must of\r\nnecessity consider botanical relationships. It is hoped that in this\r\nenforced systematic study of plums, however, something has been added\r\nto the botanical knowledge of this fruit. In classifying the varieties\r\nand species, to show their characters and relationships, the author\r\nhas chosen to dispose of the groups in accordance with his own views\r\nthough the arrangement adopted is, for most part, scarcely more than a\r\nmodification of existing classifications.\r\n\r\nAttention must be called to the indefiniteness of species and varieties\r\nof plums due chiefly to the extreme responsiveness of the plants to\r\nenvironment. On each side of the specific or varietal types there are\r\nwide ranges of variation. Since the relationships between types are often\r\nvery close it is impossible to avoid some confusion in characters,\r\nfor outliers of the types cannot but overlap. It might be well said\r\nthat these outliers are connecting links and that groups so connected\r\nshould be combined, but this would make specific division of the genus\r\nand varietal division of the species almost impossible. The groups\r\nmust, therefore, be separated along more or less arbitrary lines. But\r\nsuch arbitrary separation does not prevent natural groups, if nature be\r\nbroadly interpreted.\r\n\r\nThe chief value of the work in hand lies in its discussion of varieties.\r\nIn the descriptions the aim has been to give as tersely as possible an\r\nidea of all of the characters of the plums described. With very few\r\nexceptions the technical descriptions of varieties are original and were\r\nmade by those who have taken active part in the preparation of this book.\r\nNearly all of the varieties having full descriptions grow on the Station\r\ngrounds but whenever possible specimens of each variety from different\r\nlocalities have been compared with those growing here.\r\n\r\nA special effort has been made to give as exactly as possible the regions\r\nin which the species and varieties of plums grow. Such an effort is made\r\nunder the belief that this knowledge is of great value in the study\r\nof the factors which govern the distribution of wild and domesticated\r\nplants. If the boundaries of the regions in which a few scores of\r\nvarieties of the several fruits grow can be accurately established\r\nvaluable generalizations can be drawn regarding life zones and plant\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe reader should know what considerations have governed the selection\r\nof varieties for color-plates and full descriptions. These are: (1)\r\nThe known value of the variety for the commercial or amateur grower.\r\n(2) The probable value of new varieties. (3) To furnish data for the\r\nplum-breeder; to show combinations of species or varieties, or new\r\ncharacters, or the range in variation. (4) Some sorts have been described\r\nbecause of historical value—to better show what the trend of plum\r\nevolution has been. (5) To indicate the relationships of species and\r\nvarieties. The varieties are divided into three groups according to their\r\nimportance as gauged from the standpoints given above.\r\n\r\nIn botanical nomenclature the code adopted by the American botanists\r\nin Philadelphia in 1904 and modified by the International Botanical\r\nCongress at Vienna in 1905, has been used. For horticultural names,\r\nlacking a better code, the revised rules of the American Pomological\r\nSociety have been followed, though in a few cases we have not seen fit\r\nto follow the rules of this society, as the changes required by their\r\nstrict observance would have brought much confusion. Only those who have\r\nto work with a great number of varieties of fruit can know the chaotic\r\nconditions of our pomological nomenclature. One of the aims of the work\r\nin hand is to set straight in some degree the great confusion in plum\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nAll synonyms of varieties have been given so far as they could be\r\ndetermined but it did not seem worth while to give all of the references\r\nto be found even in standard plum literature. Fewer of these are listed\r\nfor the leading varieties than in the books on apples or grapes which\r\nhave preceded, only such being given as have been found of use by the\r\nwriters or thought of possible use to future plum students. On the other\r\nhand some references have been given for all varieties, a task not\r\nattempted in _The Grapes of New York_.\r\n\r\nAs in the preceding books the color-plates have been given much\r\nattention. Work and expense have not been spared to make the plates the\r\nbest possible with the present knowledge of color-printing. Yet the\r\nillustrations are not exact reproductions. The colors are, at best, only\r\napproximations; for it is impossible by mechanical processes to reproduce\r\nNature’s delicate tints and shades. The camera does not take colors as\r\nthe human eye sees them; and the maker of the copper plate can not quite\r\nreproduce all that the camera has taken. The colors then depend on the\r\njudgment of the printer, who by selecting and mingling colored inks,\r\nreproduces as nearly as his materials permit, the shades in his eye and\r\nmind; but no two persons see exactly the same colors in any object; so\r\nhis conception may differ much from that of the horticulturist or artist\r\nwho saw the original plum, as do theirs from each other. Still it is\r\nhoped that the color-plates will be of great service in illustrating\r\nthe text. All of the plums from which the plates were made came from\r\nthe Station grounds; the illustrations, with a few exceptions which are\r\nnoted, are of life size, as grown under the conditions existing at this\r\nplace, and as far as possible all are from specimens of average size and\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are due in particular to the plum-growers of New York who\r\nhave furnished much information for _The Plums of New York_; to numerous\r\ninstitutions in all parts of the United States who have loaned botanical\r\nspecimens; to Professor Charles Sprague Sargent for advice, information\r\nand the use of the Arnold Arboretum library and herbarium; to W. F.\r\nWight of the United States Department of Agriculture, who has given most\r\nvaluable assistance in describing the species of plums and in giving\r\ntheir range; to the Station Editor, F. H. Hall, who has had charge of\r\nthe proof-reading; to Zeese-Wilkinson and Company, New York City, for\r\ntheir care and skill in making the color-plates; and to the J. B. Lyon\r\nCompany, Albany, New York, for their careful work in the mechanical\r\nconstruction of the book.\r\n\r\n                                       U. P.

apricots,\r\npeaches, and the evergreen cherries or cherry laurels. Its widely\r\ndistributed species number a hundred or more for the world, nearly all of\r\nwhich belong north of the equator. The species of the genus are widely\r\ndistributed in both the eastern and western hemispheres, the flora of\r\neastern America and of western Asia being especially rich in species and\r\nindividuals. For most part the species of Prunus belong to the Temperate\r\nZone, but several of the evergreen cherries, usually grouped in a section\r\nunder Laurocerasus, are found in the tropics and sub-tropics.\r\n\r\nThe species cultivated for their edible fruits are found only in the\r\nTemperate Zone of the Northern Hemisphere. Of these the peach and the\r\nalmond are believed to have come from eastern and southeastern Asia;\r\nthe apricot is thought to be a native of northern China; the wild\r\nforms of the cultivated cherries are Eurasian plants, very generally\r\ndistributed in the regions to the northward where the two continents\r\nmeet. The habitats of the cultivated plums are given in detail in the\r\ntext that follows, as Asia, Europe and America. Presumably the genus\r\nhad its origin in some of the above regions; but where the center is\r\nfrom which the species radiated can never be known. Indeed, with present\r\nknowledge it cannot be said in what region Prunus has most species, is\r\nmost productive of individuals, or shows highest development and greatest\r\nvariability,—facts which might give some evidence as to the origin of\r\nthe genus. It is probable that the greatest number of combinations of\r\nthe above evidences can be shown for Asia and more especially for the\r\nEurasian region, where Europe and Asia meet; yet North America has two\r\nscore or more indigenous species about half of which are arborescent.\r\n\r\nThe history of the genus Prunus is one of continual changes. Of the\r\nbotanists who have done most toward classifying plants, Ray, Tournefort,\r\nDillenius and Boerhaave, pre-Linnaean botanists, placed only the plum\r\nin Prunus. Linnaeus adopted the name used by his predecessors for the\r\nplum alone, for a genus in which he also placed plums and cherries.\r\nAdanson and Jussieu returned to the pre-Linnaean classification but\r\nGaertner followed the grouping of Linnaeus. Necker, DeCandolle, Roemer\r\nand Decaisne held that the plum alone belongs in Prunus. Bentham &\r\nHooker, Gray and his co-workers in the several revisions of his botany,\r\nand Engler & Prantl, great authorities of the Nineteenth Century, extend\r\nthe genus to include all of the stone-fruits. On the other hand, Britton\r\nand Brown, in their recent flora of northern United States and of Canada\r\nrestrict the group to plums and cherries. Horticulturists have been less\r\ndivided in their opinions than the botanists and have very generally\r\nplaced all of the stone-fruits in one genus. The diversity of views as\r\nto what plants belong in Prunus, indicated above, suggests that the\r\ndifferences separating the several stone-fruits may not be many nor\r\nvery distinct. This is true, and makes necessary a discussion of the\r\ncharacters which distinguish these fruits.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of true plums are borne on stems in fascicled umbels and\r\nappear either before the leaves or with or after them. Flowers of the\r\ncultivated cherries are similarly borne, though the fascicles are\r\ncorymbose rather than umbelliferous. But apricot, peach and almond\r\nflowers are stemless or nearly so and solitary or borne in pairs\r\nappearing before the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of plums and cherries are globular or oblong, fleshy, very\r\njuicy, with smooth or slightly hairy skins. Peaches, apricots and almonds\r\nare more sulcate or grooved than plums and cherries and the first two\r\nhave juicy flesh, but that of the almond is dry and hard or skin-like,\r\nsplitting at maturity thereby liberating the stone; these last three\r\nfruits are distinguished from plums and cherries by having very pubescent\r\nor velvety skins though rarely, as in the nectarine, a botanical variety\r\nof the peach, and in a few cultivated apricots, the skins are smooth.\r\n\r\nThe stone of the plum is usually compressed, longer than broad, smooth\r\nor roughened, thickish and with an acute margin along the ventral suture\r\nand thinnish or grooved on the dorsal suture. The stone of the cherry\r\nis usually globular, always much thickened, smooth or a very little\r\nroughened, ridged and grooved on the ventral suture, with a thin,\r\nscarcely raised sharp margin on the dorsal suture. The stone of the\r\napricot is similar to that of the plum though thicker walled, with a more\r\nconspicuous winged margin, and is sometimes pitted. The stone of the\r\npeach is compressed, usually with very thick walls, much roughened and\r\ndeeply pitted. In the almond the stone resembles in general characters\r\nthe peach-stone, but all almond shells are more or less porous and often\r\nfibrous on the inner surfaces. The stone is the part for which the almond\r\nis cultivated and is most variable, the chief differences being that some\r\nhave thick hard shells and others thin soft shells.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of plums are convolute, or rolled up, in the bud. Cherry,\r\npeach and almond leaves are conduplicate, that is are folded lengthwise\r\nalong the midrib in bud while the leaves of the apricot, like those of\r\nthe plum, are convolute. The manner in which the leaves are packed in the\r\nbud is a fine mark of distinction in stone-fruits. In size and shape of\r\nleaves, as well as in the finer marks of these organs, the botanist and\r\npomologist find much to aid in distinguishing species and varieties but\r\nlittle that holds in separating the sub-genera. The last statement holds\r\ntrue with the floral organs also.\r\n\r\nThe near affinity of the stone-fruits is further shown by the fact that\r\nplums and apricots, plums and cherries, and the several species of each\r\nof the distinct fruits inter-hybridize without much difficulty. It is\r\na fact well-known that hybrids often surpass their parents in vigor of\r\nplant and in productiveness and this has proved true with most of the\r\nhybrids in Prunus of which we have accounts, thereby giving promise of\r\nimproved forms of these plants through hybridizing. The great variation\r\nin wild and cultivated native plums is possibly due to more or less\r\nremote hybridity.\r\n\r\nPrunus is a most variable genus. This is indicated by the several\r\nsub-genera, the large number of species and the various arrangements\r\nof these groups by different authors. At their extremes sub-genera and\r\nspecies are very distinct, but outside of the normal types, and sometimes\r\nin several directions, there are often outstanding forms which establish\r\nwell-graded connections with neighboring groups. For example, among the\r\nAmerican plums there are but few species between which and some other\r\nthere are not intermediate forms that make the two species difficult\r\nto distinguish under some conditions. There is also a wide range of\r\nvariation within the species. The modifications within the species are\r\noftentimes such as to change greatly the aspect of the plant; the trees\r\nmay be dwarf or luxuriant, smooth or pubescent; may differ in branching\r\nhabit, in leaf-form, in size and color of the flowers, in the time of\r\nopening of leaf and flower-buds, in color, shape, size, flesh, flavor and\r\ntime of ripening of fruit, in the stone and in all such characters as\r\nclimate and soil environment would be liable to modify.\r\n\r\nThis inherent variability is one of the strong assets of the genus as\r\na cultivated group of plants, for it allows not only a great number of\r\nkinds of fruits and of species but a great number of varieties. Besides,\r\nit gives to the genus great adaptiveness to cultural environment, in\r\naccordance with climate, location, soil and the handling of the trees.\r\nThe cultivator is able to modify, too, the characters of members of the\r\ngenus to a high degree in the production of new forms, but few, if any,\r\ngroups of plants having produced as many cultivated varieties as Prunus.\r\n\r\nThe genus Prunus is preeminent in horticulture, furnishing all of the\r\nso-called stone-fruits, fruits which for variety, delicious flavor and\r\nbeauty of appearance, probably surpass those of any other genus, and\r\nwhich, fresh or dried, are most valuable human foods. The seeds of one of\r\nthe fruits belonging to Prunus, the almond, are commercially important,\r\nboth for direct consumption and for the oil which is pressed from\r\nthem; in India a similar oil is obtained from the seeds of peaches and\r\napricots, while in Europe an oil from the seeds of the Mahaleb cherry\r\nis used in making perfumes. Various cordials are made from the fruits\r\nof the several species, as kirschwasser and maraschino from cherries,\r\nzwetschenwasser and raki from plums, and peach brandy from the peach;\r\nwhile fruits and seeds of the several species are soaked in spirits for\r\nfood, drink and medicinal purposes. The bitter astringent bark and leaves\r\nare more or less used in medicine as is also the gum secreted from the\r\ntrunks of nearly all the species and which, known as cerisin, is used in\r\nvarious trades. The wood of all of the arborescent species is more or\r\nless valuable for lumber, for cabinet-making and other domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nPrunus is prolific also in ornamental plants, having in common to\r\nrecommend them, rapidity of growth, ease of culture, comparative freedom\r\nfrom pests, and great adaptability to soils and climates. The plants of\r\nthis genus are valued as ornamentals both for their flowers and for their\r\nfoliage. Many cultivated forms of several of the species have single or\r\ndouble flowers, or variegated, colored or otherwise abnormal leaves,\r\nwhile the genus is enlivened by the evergreen foliage of the cherry\r\nlaurels. Nearly all of the plants of Prunus are spring-flowering but most\r\nof them are attractive later on in the foliage and many of them are very\r\nornamental in fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMS.\r\n\r\nOf all the stone-fruits plums furnish the greatest diversity of kinds.\r\nVarieties to the number of two thousand, from fifteen species, are now\r\nor have been under cultivation. These varieties give a greater range of\r\nflavor, aroma, texture, color, form and size, the qualities which gratify\r\nthe senses and make fruits desirable, than any other of our orchard\r\nfruits. The trees, too, are diverse in structure, some of the plums being\r\nshrub-like plants with slender branches, while others are true trees with\r\nstout trunks and sturdy branches; some species have thin, delicate leaves\r\nand others coarse, heavy foliage. In geographical distribution both the\r\nwild and the cultivated plum encircle the globe in the North Temperate\r\nZone, and the cultivated varieties are common inhabitants of the southern\r\ntemperate region, the various plums being adapted to great differences in\r\ntemperature, moisture and soil in the two zones.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of plums and the variability of the kinds, seemingly\r\nplastic in all characters, the general distribution of the fruit\r\nthroughout the zone in which is carried on the greatest part of the\r\nworld’s agriculture, and the adaptation of the several species and the\r\nmany varieties, to topographical, soil and climatic changes, make this\r\nfruit not only one of much present importance but also one of great\r\ncapacity for further development. Of the plums of the Old World the\r\nDomesticas, Insititias and probably the Trifloras have been cultivated\r\nfor two thousand years or more, while the work of domesticating the wild\r\nspecies of America was only begun in the middle of the last century.\r\nThere are about fifteen hundred varieties of the Old World plums listed\r\nin this work, and since the New World plums are quite as variable, as\r\ngreat a variety or greater, since there are more species, may be expected\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is made in _The Plums of New York_ to review the plum flora\r\nof this continent, but the species considered fall far short of being\r\nall of the promising indigenous plums; not only are there more to be\r\ndescribed, but it is probable that species here described will in some\r\ncases be sub-divided. The development of the pomological plum-wealth of\r\nNorth America is but begun. Not nearly as much has been done to develop\r\nthe possibilities of the European plums in America as in the case of the\r\nother tree-fruits. Probably a greater percentage of the varieties of Old\r\nWorld plums commonly cultivated came from across the sea, than of the\r\nvarieties of any other of the orchard-fruits which have been introduced.\r\nMuch remains to be done in securing greater adaptability of foreign\r\nplums to American conditions. Native and foreign plums are also being\r\nhybridized with very great advantage to pomology.\r\n\r\n_The Plums of New York_ is written largely with the aim of furthering\r\nthe development of plums in America, the possibilities of which are\r\nindicated in the preceding paragraph. With this end in view the first\r\ntask is to name and discuss briefly the characters of plums whereby\r\nspecies and varieties are distinguished, with a statement, so far\r\nas present knowledge permits, of the variability of the different\r\ncharacters. It is absolutely essential that the plum-grower have\r\nknowledge, especially if he aspires to improve the fruit by breeding, of\r\nthe characters of the plants with which he is to work. These are in the\r\nmain as follows:\r\n\r\nAll species and some horticultural varieties have more or less\r\ncharacteristic trees. Making due allowance for environment—food, moisture\r\nand light—many plum groups can be readily distinguished by the general\r\naspect of the plant. Of the gross characters of trees, size is usually\r\nmost characteristic. A species, for example, is either shrubby or\r\ntree-like. Yet under varying environment, size of plant and of the parts\r\nof the plant, are probably the first to change. Habit of growth is nearly\r\nas important as size and varies but little under changing conditions. A\r\nspecies or variety may be upright, spreading, drooping or round-topped\r\nin growth; head open or dense; the tree rapid or slow-growing. Hardiness\r\nis a very important diagnostic character, plums being either hardy,\r\nhalf-hardy or tender. Both species and varieties respond in high degree\r\nto the test of hardiness, the range for varieties, of course, falling\r\nwithin that of the species. Productiveness, regularity of bearing,\r\nsusceptibility to diseases and insects, and longevity of tree are all\r\ncharacters having value for species and varieties and with the exception\r\nof the first named, are little subject to variation.\r\n\r\nThe thickness, smoothness, color and manner of exfoliation of the\r\nouter bark and the color of the inner bark have considerable value in\r\ndetermining species but are little used in determining horticultural\r\ngroups. It is well recognized that all plums have lighter colored bark\r\nin the South than in the North. The branches are very characteristic in\r\nseveral species. The length, thickness and rigidity of the branch and\r\nthe length of its internodes should be considered, while the direction\r\nof the branch, whether straight or zigzag, are very valuable determining\r\ncharacters and relatively stable ones, seeming to change for most part\r\nonly through long ranges of climatic conditions. So, too, the arming\r\nof a branch with spines or spurs and the structure of such organs are\r\nimportant. The color, smoothness, amount of pubescence, direction,\r\nlength, thickness and the appearance of the lenticels, the presence of\r\nexcrescences on the branchlets of the first and second year’s growth and\r\nthe branching angle, are all worthy of consideration though quite too\r\nmuch has been made of these characters, especially of pubescence, in\r\ndetermining species, for they are all extremely variable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    1. _P. HORTULANA MINERI_\r\n    2. _P. AMERICANA_\r\n    3. _P. CERASIFERA_\r\n    4. _P. DOMESTICA_\r\n    5. _P. INSITITIA_\r\n    6. _P. HORTULANA_\r\n    7. _P. MUNSONIANA_\r\n    8. _P. NIGRA_\r\n    9. _P. TRIFLORA_]\r\n\r\nThe size, shape and color of leaf-buds and of their outer and inner\r\nscales and the margins of the scales differ in different species.\r\nPossibly the most evident, and therefore readiest means of identifying\r\nspecies, at least, is by the leaves. It is true that leaves are\r\nvery variable but always within limits, and either individually\r\nor collectively in giving the general aspect to a tree they are\r\ncharacteristic. Modifications of leaves most often occur in very young\r\nplants, those growing in bright sunshine or deep shade and on sprouts\r\nor suckers, but none of these are usually sufficient to mislead as to\r\nspecies. Leaf-size and leaf-form are the first characters to be noted in\r\ndetermining a plum but these are closely followed in value by leaf-color,\r\nleaf-surface, leaf-thickness and leaf-margin. Leaf-size is variable,\r\ndepending much upon the conditions noted above but leaf-form varies but\r\nlittle in the several species. So, too, the color of leaves is very\r\nconstant throughout a species, for both surfaces, though impossible\r\nto describe accurately in words and very difficult to reproduce in\r\ncolor-printing. There is a marked difference in autumnal tints not\r\nonly of species but of varieties but these are not very constant in\r\nany one location and must vary greatly under different environments.\r\nThe thickness of the leaves of the several species is a distinctive\r\ncharacter. Species of plums have very different leaf-surfaces as regards\r\nreticulation, rugoseness, pubescence and coriaceousness, all of these\r\ncharacters being quite constant, though it is to be noted that roughness\r\nof leaves and pubescence are increased by exposure to the sun and by the\r\ninfluence of some soils. There is, indeed, considerable variation in\r\nthe pubescence of the leaves of all species of plums in different parts\r\nof the country and probably too much has been made of pubescence as a\r\ndetermining character.\r\n\r\nThe margins of leaves are very characteristic of species and scarcely\r\nvary under normal conditions if the teeth at the middle of the sides be\r\ntaken rather than those toward the base or apex, these very often being\r\ncrowded, reduced or wanting. The presence of glands, their position,\r\nsize, shape and color, help to characterize several species and seem\r\nto be fairly constant guides. Some species and a great number of\r\nvarieties have the distinguishing marks of gland-like prickles tipping\r\nthe serrations in the leaf-margins. Length, thickness, rigidity and\r\npubescence of petiole have some taxonomic value. Stipules usually offer\r\nno distinguishing marks other than those mentioned under leaves.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of plums are very characteristic, giving in flowering\r\ntime a distinctive aspect to all species and distinguishing some\r\nhorticultural varieties. The flowers of all the species are borne in\r\nclusters, differing in number of individuals, according to the species;\r\nso, too, the flowers in the different species vary in size, color, in\r\nlength of their peduncles, and in pubescence, especially of the calyx.\r\nFlower-characters are constant, taking them as a whole, yet there are\r\nsome variations that must be noted. One of the most marked of these\r\nis in the time of appearance of the flowers; in the South they appear\r\nbefore the leaves but in the North with the leaves. On the grounds of\r\nthis Station there are notable exceptions to the latter statement, with\r\nvarieties of species showing considerable variation in this regard. There\r\nare some remarkable variations within species as regards size and color\r\nof the corolla and glands and pubescence of the calyx, depending upon\r\nthe environment of the plant; but on the whole these characters are very\r\nconstant. The fragrance of the flowers of plums varies from a delicate,\r\nagreeable odor to one that is quite disagreeable in some species as in\r\nAmericana; the odor seems to be a constant character.\r\n\r\nOf all structures of the plum the fruit is most variable, yet fruits are\r\nsufficiently distinct and constant, especially within species, to make\r\ntheir characters very valuable in classification. Species, whether wild\r\nor cultivated, may be distinguished in greater or less degree by the\r\nperiod of ripening of the fruits, though in this regard the cultivated\r\nvarieties of the several species vary greatly and in the wild state trees\r\nof native plums in the same locality, even in the same clump, may vary in\r\nripening as much as from two to four weeks. Species are distinguished by\r\nsize, shape, color, flesh, flavor and pit among the grosser characters of\r\nthe structure and by amount of bloom, stem, cavity, apex, suture and skin\r\namong the minor characters. The fruit is usually the first part of the\r\nplant to respond to changed conditions.\r\n\r\nCharacters derived from seed structures are generally accounted of much\r\nvalue by botanists in determining species. Such is the case with plums.\r\nThis Station has a collection of stones of over three hundred cultivated\r\nvarieties of plums and some specimens of nearly all the different\r\nspecies. The stones illustrated in the color-plates in this book show\r\nthat this structure is quite variable in size, shape, in the ends,\r\nsurfaces, grooves and ridges, even within a species; nevertheless in\r\ndescribing the several hundred forms of plums for _The Plums of New York_\r\nthe stone has been quite as satisfactory, if not the most satisfactory,\r\nof any of the organs of this plant for distinguishing the various species\r\nand varieties.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive organs of plums afford several characters and would\r\nseem to offer means of distinguishing botanical and horticultural\r\ngroups, but they are so variable in both cultivated and wild plants as\r\nto be very misleading. Not only do these organs differ very often in\r\nstructure but also in ability to perform their functions. Bailey[1] has\r\ncalled attention to the remarkable self-sterility of some varieties\r\nof the native species of plums, due to the impotency of the pollen\r\nupon flowers of the same variety. C. W. H. Heideman[2] made some very\r\ninteresting observations on what he considers distinct forms of the\r\nflowers of the Americana plums, describing for this species all of the\r\nsix possible variations of flowers enumerated by Darwin in his _Different\r\nForms of Flowers in Plants of the Same Species_. Heideman thinks that\r\nother species of Prunus exhibit similar variations. Waugh[3] made the\r\npollination of plums a subject of careful and extended study and found\r\nmuch variation in the pistils of plants of the same species, insufficient\r\npollen in some plants, pollen impotent on the stigma of the same flower,\r\nand considerable difference in the time of maturity of pollen and stigma\r\nin some plums, especially the Americana plums. These variations, most\r\nimportant to the plum-grower, are of more or less use in identifying\r\nplums.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion of the characters of plums we may pass to a detailed\r\ndescription and discussion of the species of plums which now contribute\r\nor may contribute cultivated forms to the pomology of the country either\r\nfor their fruits or as stocks upon which to grow other plums. The\r\nfollowing conspectus shows as well as may be the relations of the species\r\nof plums to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSPECTUS OF SPECIES OF PLUMS.\r\n\r\n  A. Flowers in clusters of 1 or 2.

European botanists place some of these in distinct\r\nspecies or sub-species; but few, however, even of the recent writers on\r\nthe botany of the plum, agree at all closely as to the disposition of\r\nthese edible and ornamental plums which may be doubtfully referred to\r\n_Prunus domestica_. With this disagreement between the best European\r\nauthorities where these plums have long been known, where some of them\r\nhave originated, and all may be found in orchards, botanic gardens and\r\nherbaria, it does not seem wise at this distance to attempt a discussion\r\nof such doubtful forms. It is certain, however, that Borkhausen’s _Prunus\r\nitalica_ and _Prunus œconomica_, as given in the synonymy, are but parts\r\nof _Prunus domestica_, the first including the Reine Claude plums and\r\nthe latter the various prunes. So, too, a wild form named by Borkhausen,\r\n_Prunus sylvestris_, is probably a part of _Prunus domestica_.\r\n\r\nBechstein[4] gave specific names to a number of plums which Schneider[5]\r\nholds are all cultivated forms of _Prunus domestica_. These names are\r\nnot infrequently found in botanical and pomological literature, to the\r\ngreat confusion of plum nomenclature. The following are Bechstein’s\r\nspecies:—_Prunus exigua_, _Prunus rubella_, _Prunus lutea_, _Prunus\r\noxycarpa_, _Prunus subrotunda_ and _Prunus vinaria_.\r\n\r\nThe plum in which the world is chiefly interested is the Old World\r\n_Prunus domestica_. The Domestica plums are not only the best known of\r\nthe cultivated plums, having been cultivated longest and being most\r\nwidely distributed, but they far surpass all other species, both in\r\nthe quality of the product and in the characters which make a tree a\r\ndesirable orchard plant. How much of this superiority is due to the\r\ngreater efforts of man in domesticating the species cannot be said, for\r\nthe natural history of this plum, whether wild or under cultivation, is\r\nbut poorly known. It is not even certain that these plums constitute a\r\ndistinct species, there being several hypotheses as to the origin of the\r\nDomestica varieties. Three of these suppositions must be considered.\r\n\r\nMany botanists hold that what American pomologists call the species\r\nis an assemblage of several botanical divisions. The early botanists\r\ndistributed these plums in botanical varieties of one species. Thus\r\nLinnaeus, in 1753, divided _Prunus domestica_ into fourteen sub-species,\r\nand Seringe, in 1825, made eight divisions of the species. Both of\r\nthese men include in this species, among others, plums which we now\r\nplace in _Prunus cerasifera_, the Cherry plums, and _Prunus insititia_,\r\nthe Damsons and Bullaces. Nearly all subsequent botanists who have not\r\nmade two or more species of it have recognized from two to several\r\nsub-divisions of _Prunus domestica_. It is possible that what are called\r\nthe Domestica plums should be distributed among several botanical\r\ndivisions. But it is difficult to find any differential character\r\nsufficiently constant to distinguish more than one species for the\r\nseveral hundred varieties of these plums now under cultivation. Nor are\r\nthere any cleavage lines sufficiently distinct to indicate that the\r\nedible varieties of the one species should be sub-grouped.\r\n\r\nIn coming to these conclusions the writer has studied about three hundred\r\nvarieties of Domestica plums growing on the grounds of this Station and\r\nabout half as many more growing in other parts of the country, the whole\r\nnumber representing all of the various species and sub-species which\r\nother workers have made. The differences which have been most used to\r\nclassify the varieties of Domestica in several botanic divisions have to\r\ndo chiefly with the fruit, as size, shape, color and flavor, characters\r\nso modified by cultivation and selection that they are artificial and\r\ntransitory and of little value in botanical classification. Moreover,\r\nthe botanical groups which have been founded on these characters are\r\nmuch more indistinct than ordinarily in botany because of the merging at\r\nmany points of one group into another. This indistinctness is greatly\r\nincreasing year by year through the intercrossing of varieties. When\r\nthe characters of no value to man, and, therefore, little modified by\r\ncultivation, are considered, it is scarcely possible logically to place\r\nDomestica plums in more than one species or to further sub-divide the one\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe botanists who have divided the Domestica plums into either greater\r\nor lesser botanical groups do not define their divisions with sufficient\r\naccuracy to make them clearly recognizable. Neither do they give the\r\nhabitats of the wild progenitors with sufficient certainty to carry\r\nconviction that the groups were brought under cultivation from separate\r\nancestors. Also, the several botanists who hold to the multiple species\r\ntheory for the Domestica plums do not agree as to the limits of the\r\ndifferent groups and give to them very different specific or variety\r\nnames, showing that they have widely different ideas as a basis for their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nA second theory is that _Prunus domestica_ is derived from _Prunus\r\nspinosa_ and that _Prunus insititia_ is an intermediate between the\r\ntwo.[6] This hypothesis is based upon the supposition that when\r\nDomestica plums run wild they revert to the Insititia or Spinosa form.\r\nIt is not difficult to test this theory. A study of the origin of the\r\nseveral hundred Domestica and Insititia plums discussed in Chapters\r\nIII and IV of _The Plums of New York_ does not show for any one of\r\nthem a tendency to reversion or evolution to other species; nor do the\r\ndescriptions indicate that there are many, if any, transitional forms.\r\nDuring the two thousand years they have been cultivated in Europe the Old\r\nWorld plums have been constant to type. Domestica seedlings vary somewhat\r\nbut they do not depart greatly from a well marked type. Such very few\r\nstriking departures as there seem to be are more likely to have arisen\r\nthrough crossing with other species than through reversion or evolution.\r\nThis Station has grown many pure seedlings or crosses of varieties of\r\nDomestica within the species and has had opportunity of examining many\r\nmore from other parts of the State, and none of these show reversion to\r\nthe other two Old World species. Nor, as we shall see, is there much in\r\nwhat is known of the history of these three species to lead to the belief\r\nthat the Domestica, Insititia and Spinosa plums constitute but one wild\r\nspecies or have arisen from one.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that there are few, if any, transitional forms\r\nbetween the Domestica and other European plums. It is a significant fact\r\nthat _Prunus domestica_ can be hybridized with other species of plums\r\nonly with comparative difficulty, species of plums as a rule hybridizing\r\nvery freely. This is as true with the Insititia and Spinosa as of other\r\nplums, there being few recorded hybrids of either of these species with\r\nthe one under discussion. Quite to the contrary the varieties of the\r\nseveral pomological groups of Domestica plums hybridize very freely.\r\nIf all were of one species we should expect many hybrids between the\r\nDomestica, Insititia and Spinosa plums.\r\n\r\nWe are now left with the third hypothesis, which is, as we have indicated\r\nin a preceding paragraph, that the varieties of Domestica plums belong\r\nto one species; or if they have come from more than one species the wild\r\nforms have not been distinguished and must have grown under much more\r\nnearly similar conditions than is the case with _Prunus domestica_ and\r\nany other species. Without knowledge of more than one wild form, and\r\nin view of the intercrossing of the varieties of these plums it seems\r\nbest to consider all as parts of one species, leaving to the pomologist\r\nthe division of the species into horticultural groups founded on the\r\ncharacters which make the fruit valuable for cultivation.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that the plums known in pomology as Domestica plums\r\nbelong to one species, the original habitat of the species may be\r\nsought. In spite of the great number of varieties of plums now grown in\r\nEurope and western Asia, and the importance of the fruit both in the\r\ngreen and dried state, the history of the plums cannot be traced with\r\nmuch certainty beyond two thousand years. Though stones, without doubt\r\nthose of the Insititia or Damson and the Spinosa or Blackthorn plums,\r\nare found in the remains of the lake dwellings in central Europe[7]\r\nthe pits of Domestica plums have not yet come to light. In the summer\r\nof 1909 the writer, in visiting historic Pompeii, became interested in\r\nthe illustrations of fruits in the frescoes of the ancient buildings,\r\nbut neither in the houses of the ruined city nor in the frescoes in the\r\nmuseums in Naples could he find plums, though several other fruits,\r\nas apples, pears, figs and grapes were many times illustrated. An\r\nexamination of the remains of plants preserved in the museum at Naples\r\ntaken from under the ashes and pumice covering Pompeii gave the same\r\nresults. No stone-fruits were to be found, though if widely used these\r\nshould have been on sale in the markets of Pompeii at the time of the\r\ndestruction of the city, which occurred late in August,—the very time of\r\nthe year at which the examination was made and at which time plums were\r\neverywhere for sale in Rome. This observation is but another indication\r\nthat plums were not well-known before the beginning of Christianity,\r\nsince Pompeii was destroyed in 79 A. D. In Greek literature the\r\nreferences to plums are few before the Christian era and these are more\r\nlikely to some form of Insititia, as the Damsons, rather than to the\r\nDomesticas.\r\n\r\n    Pliny gives the first clear account of Domestica plums and\r\n    speaks of them as if they had been but recently introduced.\r\n    His account is as follows:[8] “Next comes a vast number of\r\n    varieties of the plum, the particolored, the black, the white,\r\n    the barley plum, so-called because it is ripe at Barley\r\n    harvest, and another of the same color as the last, but which\r\n    ripens later, and is of a larger size, generally known as\r\n    the ‘Asinina,’ from the little esteem in which it is held.\r\n    There are the onychina, too, the cerina,—more esteemed, and\r\n    the purple plum; the Armenian, also an exotic from foreign\r\n    parts, the only one among the plums that recommends itself by\r\n    its smell. The plum tree grafted on the nut exhibits what we\r\n    may call a piece of impudence quite its own, for it produces\r\n    a fruit that has all the appearance of the parent stock,\r\n    together with the juice of the adopted fruit; in consequence\r\n    of its being thus compounded of both, it is known by the name\r\n    of ‘nuci-pruna.’ Nut-prunes, as well as the peach, the wild\r\n    plum and the cerina, are often put in casks and so kept till\r\n    the crop comes of the following year. All the other varieties\r\n    ripen with the greatest rapidity and pass off just as quickly.\r\n    More recently, in Baetica, they have begun to introduce what\r\n    they call ‘malina,’ or the fruit of the plum engrafted on the\r\n    apple tree, and ‘amygdalina,’ the fruit of the plum engrafted\r\n    on the almond tree, the kernel found in the stone of these\r\n    last being that of the almond. Indeed, there is no specimen in\r\n    which two fruits have been more ingeniously combined in one.\r\n    Among the foreign trees we have already spoken of the Damascene\r\n    plum, so-called from Damascus, in Syria, but introduced long\r\n    since into Italy, though the stone of this plum is larger than\r\n    usual, and the flesh small in quantity. This plum will never\r\n    dry so far as to wrinkle; to effect that, it needs the sun of\r\n    its own native country. The myxa, too, may be mentioned as\r\n    being the fellow countryman of the Damascene; it has of late\r\n    been introduced into Rome and has been grown engrafted upon the\r\n    sorb.”\r\n\r\nWhile the records are somewhat vague it is probable that the Domestica\r\nplums came from the region about the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian\r\nSea and especially the section east of these mountains and the sea. What\r\nseems to be the wild form of this species has been found by several\r\nbotanists in this great region.[9] Here the Huns, Turks, Mongols\r\nand Tartars, flowing back and forth in tides of war-like migration,\r\nmaintained in times of peace a crude agriculture probably long before\r\nthe Greeks and Romans tilled the soil. The plum was one of their fruits\r\nand the dried prune a staple product. Here, still, to the east, west and\r\nnorth toward central Asia, plums are among the common fruits and prunes\r\nare common articles of trade. Even in the fertile oases of the great\r\ncentral Asian desert, plums are cultivated, but whether domesticated here\r\nor brought from elsewhere cannot be told. Koch,[10] speaking of prunes\r\nin particular, gives the following account (translated) of their Asiatic\r\norigin:\r\n\r\n    “According to my investigation Turkestan and the southern Altai\r\n    Mountains are the place of origin. When in the year 1844 I\r\n    found myself in Baku on the west coast of the Caspian Sea, I\r\n    had plenty of opportunity to draw accounts of the fruits of\r\n    their native lands from the Turkestan and Bokharan merchants,\r\n    and was astonished over the high cultivation of stone fruits\r\n    in these places—at the same time I was able to taste dried the\r\n    most choice because best flavored, the Ali-Bokhara, that is\r\n    Bokhara prune. Some of these Bokharan prunes were transplanted\r\n    a long time ago to Trans-Caucasia and were especially\r\n    cultivated in the ancient city and residence of the Ruler of\r\n    the modern Elizabethpol. Unfortunately the cultivation is less\r\n    now than in earlier times. A further spread toward the west and\r\n    toward Europe, I have not been able to follow. In Greece, the\r\n    prunes are even to-day an unknown fruit.”\r\n\r\nAt about the time Pliny wrote, or somewhat before, communication had been\r\nopened between the Romans and the countries about the Caspian Sea, and a\r\nfew centuries later the devastating hordes of Asiatics came westward and\r\nfor several centuries continued to pour into eastern Europe. What more\r\nprobable than that they should have carried dried prunes as an article\r\nof food in the invasions, and eventually, as they made settlements here\r\nand there, have introduced the trees in Europe. It is certain, at any\r\nrate, as we shall see, that several of the groups of cultivated plums\r\ntrace back to the Balkan countries of Europe and the region eastward.\r\nThere, now as then, the plum is a standard fruit and prune-making a great\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe plum when first known in Europe, as described by Pliny and other\r\nearly writers, seems to have been a large and well-flavored fruit,\r\nindicating that it had been under cultivation for a long while. This,\r\nand the fact that the fruit was not known by the earliest writers on\r\nagriculture, indicate that the plum was not originally an inhabitant\r\nof southern Europe, as some suppose. It is likely that the tree has\r\nescaped from cultivation and become naturalized in the localities where\r\nit is now supposed to grow wild. _Prunus domestica_ has not been found\r\nwild nor under cultivation in eastern Asia, so far as can be learned by\r\nthe botanical and horticultural explorers of China and nearby regions,\r\n_Prunus triflora_ being the domesticated plum of that part of the\r\ncontinent, though it may well be surmised that some of the Domestica\r\nplums are cultivated in western China, a region as yet but imperfectly\r\nexplored for its plants.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly sketched the origin of the Domestica plums in the\r\nOld World we may now consider their history in the New World—a more\r\nsatisfactory task, as data are abundant and reliable.\r\n\r\nThe Domestica plums are valuable food-producing trees in America but\r\nhave not attained here the relative importance among fruits that they\r\nhold in Europe. From the earliest records of fruit-growing in the New\r\nWorld the plum has been grown less than the apple, pear, peach or cherry,\r\nwhile in Europe it is a question if it does not rank first or second\r\namong the tree-fruits. The comparatively restricted area which the\r\nDomestica plums now occupy in America is due, perhaps, to the fact that\r\nthey do not possess in as high degree as the fruits named above the\r\npower of adaptation to the trans-Atlantic environment. Without question\r\nthe feature of environment most uncongenial to plums in America is the\r\nclimate. The plum thrives best in an equable climate like that of eastern\r\nand southern Europe and of western America, and cannot endure such\r\nextremes of heat and cold, wet and dry, as are found in parts of eastern\r\nAmerica and in the Mississippi Valley. At best this fruit lacks in what\r\nis called constitution, or ability to withstand adverse conditions of any\r\nkind, whether of climate, culture, insects or fungi. Thus in America this\r\nplum suffers severely not only from climate but from several parasites,\r\nas curculio, black-knot, leaf-blight, plum-pockets and other pests.\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that in North America the Domestica plums are\r\nconfined to favored localities on the Atlantic seaboard, the Great\r\nLakes region and the Pacific coast. In the first named area they are\r\nto be found thriving to a limited degree in Nova Scotia and parts of\r\nQuebec, somewhat in central New England, and particularly well in the\r\nfruit-growing sections of New York, especially in the parts of this State\r\nwhere the climate is made equable by large bodies of water. South of New\r\nYork, excepting in a few localities in Pennsylvania, but few plums of\r\nthis species are grown. The Domestica plums are grown with indifferent\r\nsuccess in southern Ontario and in Michigan, and now and then an orchard\r\nis found to the south almost to the Gulf. In the great Valley of the\r\nMississippi and in the states of the plains this plum is hardly known.\r\nWestward in the irrigated valleys of the Rocky Mountains and the Great\r\nBasin, the climate is favorable and the European plums are nearly as\r\nwell-known as in any other portion of the continent excepting the Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\nIt is in the last named region that the foreign plum reaches its highest\r\ndevelopment in the New World. The trees in California, Oregon and\r\nWashington are very thrifty and the plums are of large size, handsome\r\nappearance and of high quality. Both tree and fruit in this favored\r\nregion are free from most of the insect and fungus troubles with which\r\nthe eastern plum-growers must contend. Curculio and black-knot, scourges\r\nof eastern orchards, are not troublesome on the western coast. In this\r\nregion the Domesticas, practically the only plums cultivated, succeed on\r\neither irrigated or naturally watered lands.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some of these plums were introduced into America\r\nby the first colonists, but if so, the early records do not show that\r\nthe fruit was much grown in this country until toward the end of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century. Certainly during the first two centuries of\r\ncolonization in the New World there were no such plum plantations as\r\nthere were of the apple, pear and cherry. Among the first importations of\r\nplums were those made by the French in Canada, more particularly in Nova\r\nScotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island and in favored situations such\r\nas the L’Islet County and the Island of Montreal bordering and in the St.\r\nLawrence River.\r\n\r\nPeter Kalm in his _Travels into North America_ in 1771 records the\r\nculture of plums as far north as Quebec with the statement that “Plum\r\ntrees of different sorts brought over from France succeed very well\r\nhere,” adding further, “The winters do not hurt them.”[11] There are\r\nother records to show that the French, always distinguished for their\r\nhorticultural tastes, if not the first to grow this fruit in America, at\r\nleast began its culture at a very early date.\r\n\r\nIn the voyages undertaken for exploration and commerce soon after the\r\ndiscovery of America by Columbus the peach was introduced in America by\r\nthe Spanish; for soon after permanent settlement had been made in the\r\nSouth the settlers found this fruit in widespread cultivation by the\r\nIndians and its origin could only be traced to the Spaniards who early\r\nvisited Florida and the Gulf region. William Penn wrote as early as\r\n1683 that there were very good peaches in Pennsylvania; “not an Indian\r\nplantation was without them.”[12] The abundance of this fruit was noted\r\nby all the early travelers in the region from Pennsylvania southward\r\nand westward but though the wild plums are often mentioned there are no\r\nrecords of cultivated plums until the colonies had long been established.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts some plums were planted by the Pilgrims, for Francis\r\nHigginson, writing in 1629, says: “Our Governor hath already planted\r\na vineyard with great hope of increase. Also mulberries, plums,\r\nraspberries, corrance, chestnuts, filberts, walnuts, smalnuts,\r\nhurtleberries.”[13] The plums were Damsons, as a statement is made a\r\nlittle later that the “Red Kentish is the only cherry and the Damson the\r\nonly plum cultivated.” A further reference to this plum is made by John\r\nJosselyn, when, writing of a voyage to New England in 1663, he says, “The\r\n_Quinces_, _Cherries_, _Damsons_, set the dames a work, _marmalad_ and\r\npreserved Damsons is to be met with in every house.”[14]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 there is the following concise account of the plums cultivated in\r\nNew England:[15]\r\n\r\n    “The better sorts which are cultivated are the horse plum, a\r\n    very pleasant tasted fruit, of large size; the peach plum, red\r\n    toward the sun, with an agreeable tartness; the pear plum,\r\n    so-called from its shape, which is sweet, and of an excellent\r\n    taste; the wheat plum, extremely sweet, oval, and furrowed in\r\n    the middle, not large; the green-gage plum, which is generally\r\n    preferred before all the rest.”\r\n\r\nA search in the colonial records of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and\r\nDelaware shows no records of cultivated plums in these states until the\r\nestablishment of the Bartram Botanic Garden near Philadelphia in 1728.\r\nHere John Bartram grew fruits, trees and flowers of many kinds received\r\nthrough exchanges of indigenous species with European correspondents.\r\nAmong the plants sent over from Europe to Bartram were several varieties\r\nof plums which were propagated and distributed throughout Pennsylvania\r\nand nearby provinces. It must not be supposed, however, that the\r\nDomestica plums had not been grown in Pennsylvania previous to Bartram’s\r\ntime. The plum grows fairly well in localities of this region, and\r\nwithout question it had been planted by the early colonists with seeds\r\nbrought from across the sea. But the absence of references to the plum,\r\nwhere they abound to the apple, pear, peach, quince and cherry, shows\r\nthat this fruit was not much cultivated by the Quakers and Swedes who\r\nsettled in the three states watered by the Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn the southern colonies the Domestica plums grow but poorly, and as the\r\nearly settlers of these states were chiefly concerned with tobacco and\r\ncotton, paying little attention to fruits, we should expect the plum to\r\nhave been neglected. Then, too, the peach, escaped from the early Spanish\r\nsettlements, grew spontaneously in many parts of the South, furnishing,\r\nwith the wild plums of the region, an abundant supply of stone-fruits.\r\nYet the plum was early introduced in several of the southern colonies.\r\n\r\nThus Beverly,[16] writing in 1722 of Virginia, says: “Peaches, Nectarines\r\nand Apricocks, as well as plums and cherries, grow there upon standard\r\ntrees,” with the further statement that these fruits grew so exceedingly\r\nwell that there was no need of grafting or inoculating them. Lawson,[17]\r\nin his history of North Carolina, written in 1714, says that the Damson,\r\nDamazeen and a large, round, black plum were the only sorts of this fruit\r\ngrown in that state in 1714.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina Henry Laurens, who should be accounted a benefactor\r\nnot only of that State but of the whole country as well, about the\r\nmiddle of the Eighteenth Century grew in Laurens Square in the Town of\r\nAmonborough all the plants suitable to that climate that widely extended\r\nmerchantile connections enabled him to procure. Thus among fruits he grew\r\nolives, limes, Alpine strawberries, European raspberries and grapes,\r\napples, pears and plums. John Watson, one of Laurens’ gardeners, planted\r\nthe first nursery in South Carolina. His plantation was laid waste in\r\nthe Revolution, though it was afterwards revived by himself and his\r\ndescendants and was still further continued by Robert Squib. The plum in\r\nseveral varieties was largely grown and distributed from this nursery.\r\n\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, was at the beginning of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury the southern center of horticultural activities and the European\r\nplum was widely distributed from here at this time. Of the several\r\nbotanic gardens, really nurseries, in Charleston, one was conducted by\r\nAndré Michaux who was sent by the French Government in 1786 to collect\r\nAmerican plants. Another was owned by John Champneys at St. Pauls, near\r\nCharleston, and was managed by a Mr. Williamson who grew all of the\r\nspecies of trees, fruits and shrubs, native and foreign, which could be\r\nprocured.[18] The third of these gardens was owned by Charles Drayton at\r\nSt. Andrews in which not only exotic fruits were grown but those of the\r\nregion as well. The plum trees frequently mentioned in the records of the\r\ntime as growing in this region came from these nurseries.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, as has been stated, the peach was introduced by the Spanish\r\nexplorers, but if the plum were also planted by the Spaniards it\r\nquickly passed out with the cessation of cultivation. But later there\r\nare records[19] of this and nearly all of the fruits of temperate and\r\nsub-tropic climates having been grown at St. Augustine and Pensacola. In\r\nthe remarkable colony[20] founded by Dr. Andrew Turnbull at New Smyrna,\r\nFlorida, in 1763, the plum was one of the fruits cultivated. It is not\r\nprobable, however, that the culture of this fruit was ever extensive in\r\nFlorida as it does not thrive there.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bartram, son of John Bartram the founder of the Bartram Botanic\r\nGarden, set out on a botanical expedition through the Southern States\r\nin 1773, which lasted five years. He records[21] numerous observations\r\non the horticulture of both the colonists and the Indians. At Savannah,\r\nGeorgia, he found gardens furnished with all the cultivated fruit trees\r\nand flowers in variety. One of the earliest settlements made by the\r\nEnglish in Georgia was Frederica, and here he found the peach, fig,\r\npomegranate and other trees and shrubs growing about the ruins; though\r\nnot specifically mentioned, the plum had probably been planted here with\r\nthe other fruits. At the junction of the Coose and Tallapoosa rivers\r\nin Alabama, there were thriving apple trees, which had been set by the\r\nFrench at Pearl Island in the last named state. Between Mobile and New\r\nOrleans, Bartram found peaches, figs, grapes, plums and other fruits\r\ngrowing to a high degree of perfection and such also was the case on a\r\nplantation on the Mississippi in Louisiana near Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nThese several references to plums show that this fruit was at least tried\r\nin early colonial times, but it was not until after the establishment\r\nof fruit-growing as an industry that any extensive plantings were made.\r\nPomology really began in America, though it languished for the first\r\nhalf-century, at Flushing, Long Island, about 1730 with the establishment\r\nof a commercial nursery by Robert Prince, first of four proprietors. Just\r\nwhen this nursery, afterwards the famous Linnaean Botanic Garden, began\r\nto offer plums cannot be said, but in 1767 one of their advertisements\r\nshows that they were selling plum trees. As a possible indication that\r\nthe fruit was not highly esteemed at this period, an advertisement of\r\ntrees for sale from this nursery in the _New York Mercury_ of March 14th,\r\n1774, does not offer plums. But in 1794 the catalog of the nursery offers\r\nplums in variety. Indeed, as we shall see, William Prince had at this\r\ntime taken hold of the propagation and improvement of the Domestica plums\r\nwith great earnestness.\r\n\r\nWilliam Prince, third proprietor of the nursery founded by his\r\ngrandfather says in his _Treatise of Horticulture_,[22] “that his father,\r\nabout the year 1790 planted the pits of twenty-five quarts of Green Gage\r\nplums; these produced trees yielding fruit of every color; and the White\r\nGage [Prince’s Imperial Gage], Red Gage and Prince’s Gage, now so well\r\nknown, form part of the progeny of these plums, and there seems strong\r\npresumptive evidence to suppose that the Washington Plum was one of the\r\nsame collection.” In 1828 the Prince nursery was offering for sale one\r\nhundred and forty varieties of plums which William Prince states[23] “are\r\na selection only of the choicest kinds, in making which, the commoner\r\nfruits have been altogether rejected.” Of the kinds grown, there were\r\nover twenty thousand trees.[24] To this nursery, to William Prince and to\r\nWilliam Robert Prince,[25] the fourth proprietor in particular, belong\r\nthe credit of having given plum-growing its greatest impetus in America.\r\n\r\nOther notable nurseries founded at the close of the Eighteenth Century,\r\nwhich helped to establish plum culture in America, were those of the\r\nKenricks, of William Coxe, and of David Landreth and Son. The Kenrick\r\nNursery was founded in 1790 at Newton, Massachusetts, by John Kenrick,\r\nunder whom and his sons, William and John A., the business was continued\r\nuntil 1870.[26] During a large part of this period the Kenrick Nursery\r\nprobably grew, imported and disposed of a greater quantity of fruit trees\r\nthan any other nursery in New England. Coxe’s nursery was established\r\nin 1806, at Burlington, New Jersey, but he had been growing fruit for\r\nmany years previous and was thus a pioneer pomologist before becoming\r\na nurseryman. In his book, _A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees_,\r\npublished in 1817, the first American book on pomology, he says[27]\r\nhe had been “for many years actively engaged in the rearing, planting\r\nand cultivating of fruit trees on a scale more extensive than has been\r\nattempted by any other individual of this country.” The third of these\r\nnurseries, that of David Landreth and Son, was conducted in connection\r\nwith the seed establishment of that family founded in Philadelphia in\r\n1784. Their collection of fruits was among the most extensive of the time\r\nand must have forwarded the cultivation of the plum in that region.[28]\r\n\r\nA century ago the fruit-growing of the country was largely in the hands\r\nof amateurs and patrons of horticulture. Many varieties of plums must\r\nhave been introduced by these lovers of plants. Among such growers of\r\nfruit was William Hamilton of Philadelphia, who introduced the Lombardy\r\npoplar in 1784, and who in 1800 was growing all the plants and fruits\r\nprocurable in Europe. Ezekiel Henry Derby of Salem, Massachusetts, one\r\nof the founders of the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture,\r\ngrew many choice foreign plants in his garden, greenhouse, orchard and\r\narboretum, and attained well merited fame as a horticulturist.[29] Dr.\r\nDavid Hosack, botanist and founder in 1801 of the Elgin Botanic Gardens\r\nin what is now New York City, was one of the most distinguished patrons\r\nof pomology of his time and grew many new fruits and plants from Europe,\r\nafterwards placing them in the hands of the horticulturists of the\r\ncountry.[30]\r\n\r\nThese are but a very few of the many men who, having wealth and leisure,\r\nwere engaged in growing fruits and plants as an avocation but were adding\r\ngreatly to the material and knowledge of those to whom fruit-growing was\r\na vocation. As a further example of how much these men contributed to\r\nhorticulture, a purchase made by a member of the New York Horticultural\r\nSociety may be cited. At a meeting of the Society held in July, 1822,\r\nhe mentioned a list of fruit trees which he had purchased in Europe,\r\ncomprising 784 varieties.[31]\r\n\r\nThe period during which American pomology may be said to have been in the\r\nhands of wealthy amateurs began shortly after the close of the Revolution\r\nand did not fully merge into that of commercial pomology until the close\r\nof the Civil War. Soon after the beginning of the Nineteenth Century,\r\nhorticulture, in fact all agriculture, was greatly stimulated by the\r\npublication of agricultural books[32] and magazines[33] and the formation\r\nof agricultural and horticultural societies.[34] The frequency of the\r\nnames of these publications of a century ago in _The Plums of New York_\r\nis an indication of the contributions they made to the culture of the\r\nplum.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly outlined the history of the Domestica plums, we come now\r\nto a discussion of what we have under cultivation in this fruit. The\r\nDomestica plums, 950 or more mentioned in this text, may be divided\r\ninto several more or less distinct pomological groups. These groups are\r\nof interest because in their history the evolution of the plum under\r\nconsideration is further developed; because such groups are serviceable\r\nto plum-growers, as each division has adaptation for particular\r\nconditions or particular purposes; and because of their value to the\r\nbreeder of plums since the largest and best differentiated groups, as a\r\nrule, have their characters most strongly fixed and may be relied upon to\r\nbest transmit them to their offspring.\r\n\r\nGroups of plums in pomology are founded for most part upon the characters\r\nof the fruit since these are most readily recognized by fruit-growers.\r\nYet whenever possible, leaf, flower and tree-characters are considered.\r\nThe name given is usually that of the best known variety in the group\r\nthough in some of the divisions the name is that of the variety which\r\nseems to be intermediate in character between the other members of the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThe groups of plums recognized by pomologists were far more distinct\r\nas we go back in their history. For, in the past, each fruit-growing\r\nregion had a pomology of its own in which the varieties of any fruit\r\nwere few and similar, constituting but one, or at most a very few types.\r\nThe various groups of plums, therefore, largely represent distinct\r\nplum-growing regions. With the increase in intercourse between the\r\ncountries of the world, cultivated plums have been taken from place to\r\nplace and as new varieties have originated, often from crosses between\r\nvarieties, the dividing lines between divisions have been more or less\r\nbroken down. The first of the groups to be considered is:—\r\n\r\n_The Reine Claude or Green Gage Plums._—This group is so distinctive\r\nin several characters that some botanists and pomologists separate it\r\nfrom other Domestica plums as a sub-species or species[35] and in common\r\nparlance its numerous varieties are very generally grouped together as\r\n“green gages” as if it were quite a distinct fruit from other plums. It\r\ncomprises a considerable number of relatively small, round, mostly green\r\nor golden plums of so high quality as to make them standards in this\r\nrespect for all plums. The Reine Claude is one of the oldest types of\r\nwhich there are records. Its varieties reproduce themselves without much\r\nvariation from seed though there are a few sorts, possibly crosses with\r\nsome other group, which are doubtfully referred to the Reine Claudes. The\r\nlater history of these plums is most interesting and is reliable, for the\r\ngroup is recognized and discussed by almost every European or American\r\npomologist who has written in three centuries.[36] The early history is\r\nnot so well known.\r\n\r\nWhere the Reine Claude plums originated no one knows. Koch[37] says\r\nhe has eaten wild plums in the Trans-Caucasian region, which must be\r\nrecorded with the Reine Claudes, but on the next page he advances\r\nthe theory that the group is a hybrid between _Prunus domestica_ and\r\n_Prunus insititia_. Schneider[38] puts the Reine Claudes in _Prunus\r\ninsititia_. The group seems to be a connecting link between the two\r\nspecies named above, having so many characters in common with each\r\nthat it is exceedingly difficult to choose between the two as possible\r\nparent species. _Prunus domestica_ probably originated in the Caucasian\r\nor Caspian region, and it is likely, as Koch suggests, that the Reine\r\nClaudes were brought from there. This is substantiated by the early\r\npomologists, who say these plums came originally from Armenia and were\r\nknown as the Armenian plums, coming eventually by the way of Greece to\r\nItaly. If this statement of its origin be true, Columella[39] knew the\r\nfruit, for he says:\r\n\r\n    —“then are the wicker baskets cramm’d\r\n    With Damask and Armenian and Wax plums.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, too, Pliny refers to them[40] in his enumeration of varieties in\r\nwhich he says: “the Armenian, also an exotic from foreign parts, the only\r\none among the plums that recommends itself by its smell.”\r\n\r\nHogg[41] says the Reine Claudes were brought from Greece to Italy and\r\ncultivated in the latter country under the name Verdochia. Hogg does not\r\ngive his authority and his statement cannot be verified in any other of\r\nthe modern European pomologies to which the authors of this work have had\r\naccess. The very complete history of the agricultural and horticultural\r\nplants of Italy[42] by Dr. Antonio Targioni-Tozzetti does not give this\r\nname. Be that as it may, some variety of this group was introduced\r\ninto England under the name Verdoch and at an early date, for in 1629\r\nParkinson[43] enumerates it in his sixty sorts describing it as “a great,\r\nfine, green shining plum fit to preserve.” Rea[44] in 1676 also lists and\r\ndescribes it as does Ray,[45] 1688.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Parkinson, Ray and Rea had the true Reine Claude,\r\nhowever, for the Verdacchio, according to Gallesio,[46] one of the best\r\nItalian authorities, is an obovate-shaped fruit while the Claudia is a\r\nround one. Gallesio says the Claudia was cultivated in many places about\r\nGenoa under the name Verdacchio rotondo; about Rome and through Modenese,\r\nfor a long time, as the Mammola; in Piedmont as the Claudia; and in\r\nTuscany as the Susina Regina. Now (1839) he says, “it is known in all\r\nItaly under the name Claudia, and has become so common as to be found in\r\nabundance in the gardens and in the markets.”\r\n\r\nThe name Reine Claude, all writers agree, was given in honor of Queen\r\nClaude, wife of Francis I, the fruit having been introduced into France\r\nduring the reign of that monarch which began in 1494 and ended 1547,\r\nthese dates fixing as accurately as possible the origin of the name.\r\nGreen Gage, the commonest synonym of either the Reine Claude group or\r\nof the variety, comes from the fact that this fruit was introduced into\r\nEngland by the Gage family. Phillips[47] gives the following account of\r\nits introduction into England:\r\n\r\n    “The Gage family, in the last century, procured from the\r\n    monastery of the Chartreuse at Paris, a collection of fruit\r\n    trees. When these trees arrived at the Mansion of Hengrave\r\n    Hall, the tickets were safely affixed to all of them, excepting\r\n    only to the Reine Claude, which had either not been put on, or\r\n    had been rubbed off in the package. The gardener, therefore,\r\n    being ignorant of the name, called it, when it first bore\r\n    fruit, the Green Gage.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the high esteem in which the plums of this group have always\r\nbeen held in England the early English colonists probably brought\r\nseeds or plants of the Reine Claudes to America. This supposition is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that Prince, in his efforts in 1790 to improve\r\nplums, chose the “Green Gage,” planting the pits of twenty-five quarts of\r\nplums of this variety. McMahon, in his list of thirty varieties of plums,\r\npublished in 1806, gives the names of at least seven varieties belonging\r\nto this group. The varieties of the group first came into America,\r\nwithout doubt, under one of the Green Gage names, but afterwards,\r\nprobably in the early part of the Nineteenth Century, importations from\r\nFrance brought several varieties under Reine Claude names though the\r\nidentity of the plums under the two names seems to have been recognized\r\nin American pomology from the first.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the trees of this group are low and the heads well rounded.\r\nThe bark is dark in color and cracks rather deeply. The shoots are thick\r\nand do not lose their pubescence. The leaves are large, broad, more\r\nor less wrinkled, coarsely crenate and sometimes doubly serrated, a\r\ncharacter not usually found in Domestica plums, and bear from one to four\r\nglands. The fruit is spherical or ovoid, green or yellow, sometimes with\r\na faint blush, stems short and pubescent, suture shallow, bloom thin,\r\ntexture firm, quality of the best, flesh sweet, tender, juicy, stone free\r\nor clinging.\r\n\r\nThe leading varieties of the Reine Claude plums are: Reine Claude, Bavay,\r\nSpaulding, Yellow Gage, Washington, McLaughlin, Hand, Peters, Imperial\r\nGage, Jefferson and Bryanston.\r\n\r\n_The Prunes._—In western America plum-growers usually speak of any plum\r\nthat can be cured, without removing the pit, into a firm, long-keeping\r\nproduct as a prune. Such a classification throws all plums with a large\r\npercentage of solids, especially of sugar, into this group. But in Europe\r\nthe term is used to designate a distinct pomological group.[48] Since we\r\nhave a number of varieties of plums long known as prunes and to which no\r\nother term can be nearly so well applied, it seems wise to follow the\r\nestablished European custom of using the term as a group name as well as\r\nfor a commercial product which is made for most part from these plums.\r\n\r\nThe prune, as an article of commerce, all writers agree, originated in\r\nHungary in the Sixteenth Century and was at that time a very important\r\ntrading commodity with Germany, France and southern Europe. If, as Koch\r\nsurmises (see page 17), the prunes originated in Turkestan or farther\r\neast—and the statements of other botanists and writers tend to show that\r\nhis view is correct—the spread of the varieties of this group westward\r\nis readily explained. In the migrations of the Huns, from western Asia\r\nto eastern Europe, in the first thousand years of the Christian era,\r\nsome Magyar or Hun intent on cultivating the soil brought with him the\r\nprune-making plums which, finding a congenial home, became the foundation\r\nof the prune industry of Hungary in the Sixteenth Century. In subsequent\r\ncommercial intercourse with western Europe the latter region was enriched\r\nby these prune-making plums from Hungary.\r\n\r\nIn America this group is now by far the most important one commercially,\r\nthough prunes were not introduced into this country until comparatively\r\nrecent years. The early lists of plums do not include any of the prunes\r\nand even as late as 1806 McMahon only mentions in the thirty varieties\r\ngiven by him but one, “the Prune Plum.” William Prince in 1828 speaks\r\nonly of the “monstrous prune,”[49] but in such a way as to lead one to\r\nbelieve that neither it, nor any other prune, was then cultivated in\r\nAmerica.[50] In 1831 William Robert Prince in his _Pomological Manual_\r\ndescribes from this group only the German Prune and the “Agen Date,” or\r\nAgen. Indeed, it was not until the beginning of the prune industry in\r\nCalifornia, about 1870, that the varieties of this group began to be at\r\nall popular though an attempt was made by the United States Patent Office\r\nto start the prune industry on the Atlantic seaboard by the distribution\r\nof cions of two prunes in 1854.[51]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the prune industry on the Pacific Coast is one of the most\r\nremarkable industrial phenomena of American agriculture. About 1856,\r\nLouis Pellier, a sailor, brought to San Jose, California, cions of the\r\nAgen from Agen, France. Some time afterward a larger plum, the Pond, was\r\nalso imported from France, supposedly from Agen, and to distinguish the\r\ntwo, the first was called Petite Prune, by which name it is now very\r\ncommonly known in the far west. The first cured prunes from this region\r\nwere exhibited at the California State Fair in 1863; commercial orchards\r\nbegan to be planted about 1870, and the first shipments of cured prunes\r\nwere probably made in 1875.[52] In 1880 the output per annum was about\r\n200,000 pounds; in 1900 the yearly capacity was estimated to be about\r\n130,000,000 pounds, valued by the producers at $450,000.[53]\r\n\r\nThe typical varieties of this group are the Italian, German, Agen,\r\nTragedy, Tennant, Sugar, Giant, Pacific and the Ungarish.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characters of the group are to be found in the fruit,\r\nwhich is usually large, oval, with one side straighter than the other,\r\nusually much compressed with a shallow suture, blue or purple, with a\r\nheavy bloom, flesh greenish-yellow or golden, firm, quality good, stone\r\nfree. The trees are various but are usually large, upright and spreading\r\nwith elliptical leaves having much pubescence on the under surface.\r\n\r\n_The Perdrigon Plums._—The Perdrigons constitute an old but comparatively\r\nunimportant group of plums.[54] The name comes from an old time\r\ngeographical division of Italy.[55] The Perdrigon plums, especially the\r\nvarieties having this name, have been grown extensively for two centuries\r\nabout Brignoles, France, where they are cured and sold as Brignoles\r\nprunes. Since they are much grown in what was formerly the province of\r\nTouraine, France, they are sometimes called Touraine plums. The early\r\npomological writers, as the Princes, Kenrick, Coxe, and even Downing,\r\ndescribed White, Red, Violet, Early and Norman Perdrigon plums, but\r\nthese are not now listed in either the pomologies or the nurserymen’s\r\ncatalogs of this country though the group is represented by Goliath, Late\r\nOrleans and Royal Tours. These plums might almost be included with the\r\nImperatrice group, differing only in the smaller and rounder fruits.\r\n\r\n_The Yellow Egg Plums._[56]—There are but few varieties belonging to this\r\ngroup, but these are very distinct, and include some of the largest and\r\nhandsomest plums. The origin of varieties of this group can be traced\r\nback over three centuries and it is somewhat remarkable that the size\r\nand beauty of the Yellow Egg Plums have not tempted growers during this\r\ntime to produce a greater number of similar varieties. Rea,[57] in 1676,\r\ndescribed the Yellow Egg under “Magnum Bonum or the Dutch Plum” as “a\r\nvery great oval-formed yellowish plum, and, according to the name, is\r\ngood as well as great.” The Imperial, which afterward became the Red\r\nMagnum Bonum, is mentioned by Parkinson[58] in 1629 as “Large, long,\r\nreddish, waterish and late.” Earlier names in France, how early cannot be\r\nsaid, were Prune d’Oeuf, yellow, white, red and violet, or the Mogul with\r\nthese several colors, and the Imperiale with the three or four colors.\r\nLater the name d’Aubert was applied to the Yellow Egg. Though this fruit\r\nwas first known in England as the Imperiall, and later as the Magnum\r\nBonum, it has been grown for at least two centuries in that country as\r\nthe Yellow Egg, and under this name came to America in the latter part\r\nof the Eighteenth Century. Koch[59] places these plums in the Date-plum\r\nfamily. The varieties of this group now grown and more or less well-known\r\nare Yellow Egg, Red Magnum Bonum, Golden Drop and Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe characters which readily distinguish the Yellow Egg group are,—the\r\nlarge size of the fruit, possibly surpassing all other plums in size,\r\nthe long-oval shape, more or less necked, yellow or purple color and the\r\nyellow flesh. The plums are produced on tall, upright-spreading trees.\r\n\r\n_The Imperatrice Plums._—This is a poorly defined assemblage of\r\nvarieties, of which dark blue color, heavy bloom, medium size and oval\r\nshape are the chief characters. It is impossible to trace the origin of\r\nthe group or to refer varieties to it with accuracy. The Imperatrice,\r\nof which Ickworth is an offspring, seems to have been one of the first\r\nof the blue plums to receive general recognition, and can as well as\r\nany other variety give name to the type. This group contains by far the\r\ngreatest number of varieties of any of the divisions as here outlined,\r\nchiefly because the color, the size, and the shape are all popular with\r\ngrowers and consumers. This has not always been the case, for in the old\r\npomologies, blue plums are comparatively few in number, Parkinson, for\r\ninstance, giving in his list of sixty in 1629 not more than a half-dozen\r\nDomesticas that are blue.\r\n\r\nAmong the varieties that fall into this group are:—Ickworth, Diamond,\r\nArch Duke, Monarch, Englebert, Shipper, Arctic, Smith Orleans and\r\nQuackenboss.\r\n\r\nAbout the only characters that will hold for this large and variable\r\ngroup are those of the fruits as given above, though to these may be\r\nadded for most of the varieties included in the division, thick skin and\r\nfirm flesh, clinging stones and poor quality. The trees vary much but are\r\nusually hardy, thrifty and productive, making the members of the group\r\nprime favorites with commercial fruit-growers.\r\n\r\n_The Lombard Plums._—Just as the blue plums have been thrown in the last\r\nnamed group, so we may roughly classify a number of red or reddish or\r\nmottled varieties in one group. If the oldest name applicable to this\r\ngroup were given it should be called after the Diaper plums, well-known\r\nand much cultivated French sorts of two and three centuries ago. Since\r\nthey are no longer cultivated, and as the Lombard seems to be a direct\r\noffspring of them and is fairly typical of the division, the name chosen\r\nis as applicable as any. These plums differ but little from those of the\r\npreceding group, except in color and in having a more obovate shape, a\r\nmore marked suture, smaller size and possibly even greater hardiness and\r\nproductiveness, and if anything, even poorer quality, though to this last\r\nstatement there are several marked exceptions. In this group are no doubt\r\nmany varieties which are crosses between some of the old red plums and\r\nvarieties of the other groups given.\r\n\r\nThe following sorts may be named as belonging here:—Lombard, Bradshaw,\r\nVictoria, Pond, Duane, Autumn Compote, Belle, Middleburg and Field.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2.= =PRUNUS INSITITIA= Linnaeus\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS INSITITIA_]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Linnaeus _Amoen.

His description of the\r\nspecies is not definite and can be made to apply to any one of several\r\nvery distinct plums. But the botanists who recognize the species usually\r\ninclude in it, among cultivated plums, the Bullaces and the Damsons,\r\nplums which differ only in the shape of the fruit, the former being round\r\nand the latter oval. Some of the texts noted in the references for this\r\nspecies also place the St. Julien and the Mirabelle plums here. In _The\r\nPlums of New York_ the authors consider the Bullaces, Damsons, the St.\r\nJulien and the Mirabelles as belonging to this species.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Linnaeus established at an earlier date than the naming\r\nof _Prunus insititia_ his _Prunus domestica damascena_, in which the\r\nvarietal name indicates that he meant the Damsons, but the description\r\nof the variety taken by him from Bauhin’s Pinax[60] making the plum\r\nlarge, sweet and dark purplish, cannot be made to apply to this fruit,\r\nnor can it be connected definitely with any other plum; this being true,\r\nand since Linnaeus refers to no type specimen, figure, or locality, his\r\n_Prunus domestica damascena_ according to current botanical practices in\r\nAmerica, should be rejected.\r\n\r\nThe trees of the Insititia varieties are readily distinguished from\r\nthe Domestica sorts in having a dwarfer and more compact habit; much\r\nsmaller and more ovate leaves with more closely serrate margins; branches\r\nmore finely divided, more slender, with shorter joints, and bearing\r\nspines or spinescent spurs; having a more abundant and a more clustered\r\ninflorescence, with smaller flowers, a glabrous instead of a pubescent\r\npistil and calyx-tube; reflexed calyx-lobes where in Domestica they\r\nare often erect; and flowers appearing nearly a week later. The number\r\nof stamens in _Prunus domestica_ averages about thirty; in _Prunus\r\ninsititia_, about twenty-five. The fruit-characters of _Prunus insititia_\r\nare even more distinctive. The fruits are smaller, being less than an\r\ninch in diameter, more nearly round or oval, more uniform in shape, never\r\nstrongly compressed as in Domestica, with a less distinct suture and more\r\noften with a pronounced neck. The color is usually the Damson purple or\r\nthe Mirabelle yellow, with no intermediate colors as in Domestica and\r\nwith few or but slight variations as compared with the other species.\r\nThe plums are sweet or sour with a very much smaller range in flavor in\r\nthe case of the Insititias and withal very distinct from that of _Prunus\r\ndomestica_. The stones are smaller, more oval and much more swollen.\r\n\r\nIn variability the Insititia plums are quite the reverse of the\r\nDomesticas, almost wholly lacking this quality. These plums have been\r\ncultivated over two thousand years, yet there is seemingly little\r\ndifference between the sorts described by the Greeks and Romans at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian Era and those we are now growing. So, too, one\r\noften finds half-wild chance seedlings with fruit indistinguishable from\r\nvarieties under the highest cultivation. This pronounced immutability of\r\nthe species is one of its chief characteristics.\r\n\r\nThere are probably several sub-divisions of _Prunus insititia_ but\r\nmaterial does not exist in America for the proper determination of the\r\ntrue place for these forms, and the Old World botanists cannot agree in\r\nregard to them. It is probable that _Prunus subsylvestris_ Boutigny[61]\r\nand _Prunus pomarium_ Boutigny[62] belong to _Prunus insititia_ and\r\nalmost beyond question _Prunus syriaca_ Koehne[63] is the yellow-fruited\r\nMirabelle of this species. _Prunus insititia glaberrima_ Wirtg,[64]\r\noccasionally found in the herbaria of Europe has, with its small,\r\nroundish-obovate leaves, but little appearance of _Prunus insititia_ and\r\nmay be, as Schneider surmises,[65] a cross between _Prunus spinosa_ and\r\nthe Myrobalan of _Prunus cerasifera_.\r\n\r\nThe Insititia plums are second in importance only to the Domesticas.\r\nTheir recorded history is older. This is the plum of the Greek poets,\r\nArchilochus and Hippona, in the Sixth Century B. C.[66] Theophrastus,\r\nthe philosopher, mentioned it three hundred years before Christ, as\r\ndid Pollux, the writer and grammarian, a century before the Savior,\r\nwhile Dioscorides, the founder of botany, during the last named period,\r\ndistinguishes between this plum and one from Syria, presumably a\r\nDomestica. This is one of the twelve kinds of plums described by Pliny\r\n(see page 17) who calls it the Damascene, so-called from Damascus in\r\nSyria, and says of it, “introduced long since into Italy.” It is the\r\nDamask plum of Columella when in his tenth book he says:\r\n\r\n      “then are the wicker baskets cramm’d\r\n    With Damask and Armenian and Wax plums.”\r\n\r\nThe yellow plums of the Roman poets, Ovid and Vergil, are probably the\r\nBullaces or Mirabelles of this species. Indeed, its cultivation was\r\nprobably prehistoric, for Heer[67] has illustrated and described stones\r\nof a plum found in the lake-dwellings of Robenhausen which can be no\r\nother than those of Insititia.\r\n\r\nThe authentic written history of this plum may be said to have begun with\r\nor a little before the Christian Era. The records of the cultivation and\r\ndevelopment through the early centuries of the present chronology and\r\nthe Middle Ages to our own day may be found in the herbals, botanies,\r\npomologies, agricultural and general literature of the past two thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_ now grows wild in nearly all temperate parts of Europe\r\nand western Asia—from the Mediterranean northward into Norway, Sweden and\r\nRussia. The botanists of Europe very generally agree that its original\r\nhabitat was in southern and southeastern Europe and the adjoining parts\r\nof Asia, and that elsewhere it is an escape from cultivation. Hooker[68]\r\nsays that _Prunus insititia_ grows in western temperate Himalaya,\r\ncultivated and indigenous, from Gurwhal to Kashmir, the type being that\r\nof the “common yellow-fruited Bullace.” A few botanical writers hold that\r\nit is truly wild in the parts of Europe where now found growing. There\r\nare also not a few botanists who, as has been stated in the discussion of\r\nthe Domestica plums, unite the Insititias with the Domesticas, and others\r\nwho combine these two with the Spinosa plums in one species, _Prunus\r\ncommunis_.[69]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the species is occasionally found naturalized in\r\neastern United States; several botanists so give it.\r\n\r\nWherever the habitat of the Insititia plums may have been, practically\r\nall writers from the Greeks and Romans who first mention this fruit to\r\nthose of the present time, connect the cultivated varieties in one way\r\nor another with the old Semite city, Damascus. It is almost certain\r\nthat the Syrians or Persians were the first to cultivate these plums,\r\nand that they were unknown in Europe as domesticated varieties until\r\nthe Greeks first and the Romans afterward came in intimate contact with\r\nthe people of the Orient. Thus it is often stated in the old pomologies\r\nthat Alexander the Great brought these plums from the Orient after his\r\nexpedition of conquest and that some centuries later Pompey, returning\r\nfrom his invasion of the eastern countries, brought plums to the Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Insititia plums in America has been given in the main\r\nin the discussion of the Domestica plums, for the varieties of the two\r\nspecies have never been kept separate by plum-growers, all being grouped\r\ntogether as European plums. It is probable, however, that the Damson\r\nplums of this species were earlier introduced and more generally grown\r\nthan any other of the European plums by the English settlers of America,\r\nas the references to plum-growing before the Revolution are largely to\r\nthe Damsons. The reasons for this early preference for these plums are\r\nthat they come true to seed while most varieties of the Domestica do not;\r\nand trees and cions were not readily transportable in colonial times;\r\nand, too, the Damsons have always been favorite plums with the English.\r\n\r\nWhen the first American fruit books were published at the beginning of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century the Damsons and Bullaces were widely grown, for\r\nall writers give a relatively large number of varieties of these plums\r\nand speak well of them. Thus McMahon,[70] in his list of thirty plums\r\ngives six that belong here, ending his list with “Common Damson, etc.,”\r\nas if there were still more than those he enumerates. Prince, in his\r\n_Pomological Manual_, in 1832, gives at least eighteen sorts that may\r\nbe referred to Insititia with the statement that one of them, the Early\r\nDamson “appears to have been brought to this country by the early Dutch\r\nsettlers, or by the French who settled here at the time of the revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes,” adding, “It is much disseminated throughout this\r\nsection of the country.” At the end of the Eighteenth Century Deane’s[71]\r\n_New England Farmer or Georgical Dictionary_, in a discussion of plums\r\nin general says: “The most common plum in this country is the Damascene\r\nplum, an excellent fruit for preserving, which is said to have been\r\nbrought from Damasam, hence the name.”\r\n\r\nThe hardiness, thriftiness and productiveness of all of the varieties\r\nof this species commend them to those who cannot give the care required\r\nto grow the less easily grown Domesticas, and in America, as in Europe,\r\nthese plums are to be found in almost every orchard and in many\r\ncommunities half-wild, thriving with little or no care. The fact that\r\nthey are easily propagated, growing readily from suckers and coming true\r\nto seed is an added reason for their general distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Insititia plums do not seem to hybridize freely with other species—at\r\nleast there are no recorded offspring of such hybrids, though Koch\r\nbelieves the Reine Claudes to be a hybrid group between this species and\r\nthe Domesticas and there is much evidence in the fruit to show that the\r\nFrench Damson is part Domestica. The tree-characters of the Insititia\r\nplums are such, especially as regards vigor, hardiness, productiveness\r\nand freedom from disease, as to seemingly make hybrids with them very\r\ndesirable. That this species can be hybridized with Domestica, at least,\r\nis certain from work done at this Station where we have made a number of\r\ncrosses between them.\r\n\r\nFour groups of plums, the Damsons, Bullaces, Mirabelles and St. Juliens,\r\nin all eighty-six varieties mentioned in _The Plums of New York_, may be\r\nreferred to this species. There are so few real differences between these\r\ndivisions, however, that it is hardly possible, logically, to sub-divide\r\nInsititia plums into more than two groups. But since the groups of plums\r\ngiven above are so often referred to in pomological works it is necessary\r\nto discuss them.\r\n\r\n_The Damsons._—The description given the species fits this division of\r\nit closely, the differentiating character for the fruit, if any, being\r\noval fruits, while the Bullaces, most nearly like these, are round. The\r\norigin of the Damsons, as we have seen, was in Syria and near the ancient\r\ncity, Damascus, their written history dating back several centuries\r\nbefore Christ. This plum has escaped from cultivation in nearly all the\r\ntemperate parts of Europe and more or less in the eastern United States,\r\nthe wild forms often passing under other names, as the Wild, Wheat,\r\nSpilling, Donkey, Ass, Hog and Horse plums. The true Damsons have a\r\nfine spicy taste, which makes them especially desirable for cooking and\r\npreserving, but a very decided astringency of the skin makes most of the\r\nvarieties of Damsons undesirable to eat out of the hand; this astringency\r\nlargely disappears with cooking or after a light frost. Nearly all\r\nDamsons are sour, though a few sweet Insititias are placed in this group.\r\n\r\nSince the seeds grow readily and the sprouts are very manageable, the\r\nDamsons, with the other Insititias, are much used as stocks upon which to\r\nwork other plums, especially the less hardy and less thrifty Domesticas.\r\nAlthough less used now than formerly for stocks it is a question if these\r\nplums, or some of their near kin, do not make the best obtainable stocks.\r\nThere seems to be much difference in the varieties of Insititia in their\r\ncapacity to send up sprouts. The forms which send up the fewest sprouts\r\nare much the best for use as stocks.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the Damsons are highly esteemed now only by the\r\nAmericans and English, being grown much less at present in Continental\r\nEurope than a century or two ago. Late pomological works and\r\nnurserymen’s catalogs from others than the English or Americans barely\r\nmention these plums.\r\n\r\n_The Bullaces._—It is impossible to distinguish between the\r\ntree-characters of the Damsons and the Bullaces, and pomologists are far\r\nfrom agreeing as to what differences in the fruit throw a variety into\r\none group or the other. Some writers call a sour variety of Insititia a\r\nDamson, and a sweet one a Bullace; others make color the differentiating\r\ncharacter, calling the purple plums Damsons and the light colored ones\r\nBullaces; still others call oval Insititias Damsons and round ones\r\nBullaces. If a distinction is to be made, shape seems to be the character\r\nupon which it should be based. The name Bullace applies to the round\r\nshape of the fruit, but when first used or by whom given it is impossible\r\nto say. It is commonly used in the old herbals and pomologies of both\r\nEngland and Continental Europe, there being many variations of the name,\r\nof which _bullis_ and _bulloes_ are most common with the word _bullum_ in\r\nfrequent use for the fruit of the Bullace tree. The varieties of Bullaces\r\nare few in number, and are not largely grown, being known for most part\r\nonly in fruit collections, the Damsons serving all the purposes for which\r\nthe Bullaces would be worth growing, and to better advantage.\r\n\r\n_The Mirabelles._—The Mirabelles are round, yellowish or golden,\r\nfreestone Insititias, ranging from half an inch to an inch in diameter,\r\nvery slightly sub-acid or sweet. The trees do not differ from the type\r\nof the species unless it be in even greater productiveness than the\r\nother groups of Insititia, all of which bear very abundant crops. The\r\nfruits represent the highest quality to be found in the varieties of this\r\nspecies, approaching the Reine Claudes of _Prunus domestica_ in richness\r\nof flavor. Indeed, the Mirabelles may almost be said to be diminutive\r\nReine Claudes, resembling them not only in quality but in color and in\r\nshape, and so closely as to lend color to Koch’s[72] supposition that\r\nthe Reine Claudes are hybrids between _Prunus domestica_ and _Prunus\r\ninsititia_.\r\n\r\nIn France the Mirabelles are accorded second if not first place among\r\nplums, being superseded in popularity, if at all, only by the Reine\r\nClaudes. They are used in the fresh state and as prunes, and are freely\r\nmade into conserves, preserves, jellies and jams, being found in the\r\nmarkets in some of these forms the year round. They are much used for\r\npastry, their size being such that one layer of fruit suffices and is\r\nnone too deep for a good pie or tart. The fermented juice of these plums\r\nis somewhat largely used in the making of a distilled liquor, a sort of\r\nplum brandy. The dozen or more varieties of Mirabelles differ chiefly in\r\nsize of fruit and in time of maturity. The range in size is from half an\r\ninch to an inch in diameter and in time of ripening in France from the\r\nfirst of August to the first of October.\r\n\r\nThe Red Mirabelle frequently referred to in pomological works is _Prunus\r\ncerasifera_, and the name is wrongly so used, for if not first applied\r\nto the several varieties of Insititia it now by almost universal usage\r\nbelongs to these plums. The origin of the word, as now commonly used,\r\ndates back over two centuries, being found in the pomological treatises\r\nof the Seventeenth Century. The assumption is that Mirabelle is derived\r\nfrom _mirable_ meaning wonderful, and the name was first so used by the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Mirabelles are hardly known in America. These plums\r\nhave so many good qualities of tree and fruit that American pomology\r\nwould be greatly enriched if the best Mirabelle varieties were grown in\r\nboth home and commercial orchards. They should be used in cookery much as\r\nare the Damsons, which they surpass for some purposes.\r\n\r\n_St. Juliens._—The St. Julien that the writer has seen in American and\r\nEuropean nurseries is unmistakably an Insititia. At one time St. Julien\r\nstocks were used almost exclusively in New York nurseries, and few large\r\nplum orchards are free from trees which have through accident to the cion\r\ngrown from the stock. Such trees bear fruit so like the Damson that one\r\nis warranted in saying that the two are identical, and that St. Julien is\r\nbut a name used for a Damson when the latter is employed as a stock. The\r\nfruit is sweetish with a taste identical with that of the sweet Damsons.\r\n\r\nPlum-growers who have had experience with plums on several stocks are\r\nalmost united in the opinion that the St. Julien is the best of all for\r\nthe Domesticas, at least. St. Julien stocks were formerly imported in\r\ngreat numbers from France, where it is still largely grown for European\r\nuse. The name seems to have come in use in France more than a century\r\nago, but why given or to what particular Insititia applied does not\r\nappear. There is, however, a distinct variety or type of Insititia used\r\nby the French in producing stocks, for French pomologists advise careful\r\nselection of mother-plants for the production of the young trees by\r\nsuckers or layers, and caution growers of stocks in no case to use seeds\r\nwhich bring twiggy, spiny and crooked stocks.[73] St. Julien plums are\r\nseemingly nowhere grown at present for their fruits.\r\n\r\nThere are several ornamental forms of plums which are given specific\r\nnames by European horticulturists, mentioned in the last paragraph in the\r\ndiscussion of the Domestica plums, which some writers place, in part at\r\nleast, with the Insititias. These plums are not found in America and it\r\nis impossible to place them with certainty in either of the two species\r\nupon the contradictory evidence of the Europeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3.= =PRUNUS SPINOSA= Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n    =1.= Linnaeus _Sp.

Its blossoms are pure white, about half\r\nan inch in diameter and not quite double, as the stamens form an orange\r\ncluster in the center of the flower. The flowers are thickly crowded on\r\nshort spiny branches, the dark color of which forms a striking contrast\r\nto the white flower. _Prunus spinosa purpurea_ is another horticultural\r\ngroup, more vigorous than the species, less thorny and with larger\r\nfoliage. Its branches are erect, purplish in color, striated. The leaves\r\nand petioles are at first very pubescent but at maturity glabrous; the\r\nupper surface of the leaf is green marked with red, the under a deep\r\nreddish-violet. The flowers are a pale rose. One or two variegated forms\r\nof this species are also offered by nurserymen.\r\n\r\nSchneider holds[79] _Prunus fruticans_ Weihe[80] and _Prunus spinosa\r\nmacrocarpa_ Wallroth[81] to be crosses between _Prunus spinosa_ and\r\n_Prunus insititia_.\r\n\r\n_Prunus spinosa_, the Blackthorn or European Sloe, is the common wild\r\nplum of temperate Europe and the adjoining parts of Asia. It is adventive\r\nfrom Europe to America and is now quite naturalized along roadsides and\r\nabout fields in many places in eastern United States. _Prunus spinosa_\r\nis considered by some authors the remote ancestor of the Domestica and\r\nInsititia plums, but as brought out in the discussion of the last named\r\nspecies, such parentage is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe Spinosa plum is a common and often pestiferous plant in its habitat,\r\nthe roots forming such a mass that in general it is impossible for any\r\nother vegetation to grow in its vicinity. The plant is small, spreading\r\nand much branched and bristles with sharp thorns. The leaves are smaller\r\nthan those of any of the other Old World species, ovate in shape and very\r\nfinely serrate. The flowers are usually single but sometimes in pairs or\r\nthrees and are borne in such number as to make a dazzling mass of white;\r\ncomparatively few of these, however, set fruit. The fruit is round and\r\nsmall, usually less than half an inch in diameter, and, typically, so\r\nblack as to have given rise to the old saying, “as black as a sloe.” The\r\nfruits are firm but rather juicy, with an acid, austere flavor, which\r\nmakes them unfit for eating out of hand until frost-bitten, when the\r\naustereness is somewhat mitigated. The stone is much swollen, with one\r\nedge acute.\r\n\r\nEuropean nurserymen now and then offer trees of the Spinosa plum for\r\nfruit-growing, sometimes with the statement that the fruit is sweet. But\r\npomologists do not speak highly of these cultivated Spinosas and hold\r\nthat they are hardly worth cultivation. The wild plums are quite commonly\r\npicked for certain markets in Europe, however, especially those in which\r\nthe Domesticas and Insititias are not common. With plenty of sugar the\r\nfruits make a very good conserve. In France the unripe fruit is pickled\r\nas a substitute for olives and the juice of the ripe fruit is sometimes\r\nused to make or adulterate cheap grades of port wine. In the country\r\ndistricts of Germany and Russia the fruit is crushed and fermented and\r\nspirit distilled from it.\r\n\r\nThe species is quite variable within limits, but since the wild fruits\r\nhave been used from the time of the lake-dwellers of central Europe,\r\nwithout the appearance of desirable forms, the variations are not\r\nlikely to give horticultural varieties worth cultivating for table use.\r\nThe variations in the fruit are usually in color, the size and flavor\r\nchanging but little. Several ornamental forms are in cultivation, of\r\nwhich the chief ones have been named.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4.= =PRUNUS CURDICA= Fenzl and Fritsch.\r\n\r\n    =1.= Fenzl and Fritsch _Sitzb. Akad. Wien._ Bd.

Laubh._ =1=:628. 1906.\r\n\r\nThe few herbarium specimens that the writer has seen of this species from\r\nsoutheastern Europe strongly resemble _Prunus spinosa_ but Schneider in\r\nthe above reference describing it from living specimens says that it\r\ndiffers from the species last named as follows: “Lower growth, about\r\none-half as high, spreading squarrose ramification, much less thorniness;\r\nleaves more like _domestica_, when young hairy on both sides, later\r\nabove nearly and underneath more or less glabrous; petiole shorter, not\r\nexceeding one cm.; blooms later, nearly with the leaves, white, about\r\ntwenty-two mm. in diameter, borne almost always single in this species;\r\npedicel finely pilose, in _Prunus spinosa_ almost glabrous; stamens\r\nfewer, about twenty; fruit blue black, stem longer, exceeding twelve mm.”\r\n\r\nSo far as appears from the few and scant European references to the\r\nspecies it has no horticultural value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5.= =PRUNUS COCOMILIA= Tenore.\r\n\r\n    =1.= Tenore _Fl.

Buds small, roundish-ovate; leaves\r\n    roundish-obovate, sharply and distinctly serrated, glabrous\r\n    or upon the ribs on the under side sparsely pubescent.\r\n    Flowers usually in pairs, opening before or with the leaves,\r\n    greenish-white, pedicels about the length of the calyx-cups.\r\n    Fruit yellow, agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe writer has seen only herbarium specimens of this plant and has taken\r\nthe description given from European texts. According to Schneider the\r\nspecies has been divided into two varieties by the Italian botanists.\r\n_Prunus cocomilia typica_ having oblong-ovate fruit and _Prunus\r\ncocomilia brutia_ having round fruit. Schneider holds also that _Prunus\r\npseudoarmeniaca_ Heldr. and Sart.[82] from Epirus and Thessaly is a\r\nvariety of _Prunus cocomilia_ differing chiefly in having more pointed\r\nleaves and smaller oblong-roundish red plums. The same author puts in\r\nthis species still another plum, a hairy-leaved form from Thessaly which\r\nhe calls _Prunus cocomilia puberula_. He places here also _Prunus ursina_\r\nKotschy[83] which differs only in minor respects from the species,\r\nchiefly in having violet-red fruit though Boissier[84] mentions a\r\nyellow-fruited plum which he calls _Prunus ursina flava_.

Why applied\r\nto this plum is not known. Myrobalan had long before been used, and is\r\nstill, as the name of several plum-like fruits of the East Indies, not\r\nof the genus Prunus, which are used in tanning, dyeing, ink-making and\r\nembalming. Until Ehrhart gave it the name _Prunus cerasifera_ in 1789 it\r\nwas known as the Myrobalan plum by botanists, some of whom, and nearly\r\nall horticulturists, have continued the use of the name until the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the botanists who have used Myrobalan for this plum have\r\ncalled it a botanical variety of _Prunus domestica_. Among these were\r\nLinnaeus and Seringe. Others, as Loisleur and Poiteau, have preferred the\r\nname for the species as distinguished by Ehrhart.\r\n\r\nMany of the early botanists, as Tournefort in 1700, Ehrhart in 1701,\r\nLoudon in 1806 and Loisleur in 1812, gave the origin of the Cerasifera\r\nplums as North America, but upon what authority does not appear. On the\r\nother hand many European botanists, including Linnaeus, gave the habitat\r\nas Europe or Asia. The supposition that this plum came from North America\r\nhardly needs discussion. The plum flora of this continent has been well\r\nenough studied so that it can be said that no plant that could by any\r\npossibility be the Cerasifera plum grows on this side of the Atlantic.\r\nNeither does it seem logical to consider this an off-shoot of _Prunus\r\ndomestica_, for fruit and tree-characters are distinctly different, and\r\nfor a member of the genus Prunus are remarkably constant. Moreover, there\r\nis abundant evidence to show that this is a distinct species and that its\r\nnativity is in the Turkish and nearby countries in Europe and Asia and\r\nthat there it has been in cultivation for a long time.\r\n\r\nIt is very significant that in the old herbals and botanies a frequent\r\nname of this fruit is “the Turkish plum.” But more specific and almost\r\nconclusive proof is that two forms of plums belonging to this species are\r\nknown to come from the Caucasus region. _Prunus divaricata_[86] is now\r\nconsidered by some botanists to be a synonym of _Prunus cerasifera_ and\r\nby others to be a botanical variety of the last named species. Ledebour,\r\nwho named it, found it in the Trans-Caucasian region. It differs from the\r\ntype only in having much divided, wide-spreading and nearly prostrate\r\nbranches. The Pissardi plum, a purple-leaved form of this species,\r\noriginated in Persia. A plum now growing in the Arnold Arboretum raised\r\nfrom seed from Turkestan, presumably from wild stock, is identical with\r\nplants of Cerasifera of European origin. And, according to Schneider,[87]\r\nthis plum is known in the wild state in Caucasus, Trans-Caucasus,\r\nnorthern Persia and Turkestan.\r\n\r\nThe Cerasifera plums are small trees, usually upright but in some forms\r\nwith spreading branches which are commonly unarmed, glabrous and brownish\r\nin color. The leaves are ovate and smaller and thinner and with more\r\nfinely serrate margin than those of the Domestica plums. It blooms\r\nprolifically and bears large, white, single or paired flowers, making\r\na most beautiful tree when in flower. The fruit is small, round, and\r\ncherry-like, from half an inch to an inch in diameter, usually red but\r\nsometimes yellow. The flesh is soft, sweetish or sub-acid and poor. The\r\nstone is turgid, smooth and pointed. The species is variable in nearly\r\nall tree-characters, and were it not surpassed by other plums for its\r\nfruit there would undoubtedly be a great number of varieties cultivated\r\nfor the markets. There are, however, but few cultivated Cerasiferas, only\r\nnineteen being described in _The Plums of New York_. It is very generally\r\ndistributed wherever plums are grown, because of the use to which it has\r\nbeen put as stocks for other species. For this purpose it is held in\r\nhigh esteem the world over. In the nurseries of New York it is now used\r\nmore than any other stock and it is common to find it fruiting here and\r\nthere from plants set for or used as stocks. In fact practically all\r\nthe cultivated varieties have arisen as survivals of plants meant for\r\nstocks. It is almost certain that the Cerasifera, or Myrobalan, as it is\r\nuniversally known by horticulturists, dwarfs the cion and that it is not\r\nequally well suited to all varieties; but it does not “sprout” as badly\r\nas some other stocks, is adapted to many soils, and the young trees grow\r\nwell and are rapidly budded, giving at the start a strong and vigorous\r\norchard tree.\r\n\r\nThe Cerasifera plums are handsome trees. The foliage is a fresh and\r\nbeautiful green and whether covered with a mass of flowers or loaded with\r\nred or yellow fruit these plums are as handsome as any of our cultivated\r\nfruit trees, and as desirable for ornamentals.\r\n\r\nThe hardiness, thriftiness, freedom from disease and adaptability to\r\nsoils make the species desirable for hybridizing. A number of breeders of\r\nplums have made use of it with some indications of a promising future,\r\nseveral interesting hybrid offspring of this species being described in\r\n_The Plums of New York_.\r\n\r\nThe small number of varieties of Cerasifera cultivated for their\r\nfruit indicates that but little can be expected from this species by\r\nplum-growers, since so little has come from it in the shape of edible\r\nfruits, though it has been under general cultivation for over three\r\nhundred years, at least, as an ornamental and as a stock. Several\r\nvaluable groups of ornamentals have arisen from Cerasifera, of which the\r\nfollowing are most notable:—\r\n\r\nIn 1880 M. Pissard, gardener to the Shah of Persia, sent to France a\r\npurple-leaved plum which proved to be a form of _Prunus cerasifera_. To\r\nthis plum Dippel[88] gave the name _Prunus cerasifera atropurpurea_,\r\nwhile horticulturists very generally call it _Prunus pissardi_. A\r\nclose study of the purple-leaved plum reveals no character in which it\r\ndiffers from the species except in the color of foliage, flowers and\r\nfruit; the leaves are purple, as are also the calyx and peduncles of the\r\nflowers, while the fruit is a dark wine-red. These are but horticultural\r\ncharacters and do not seem to be of sufficient importance to establish\r\nfor this plant a botanical variety. This view is strengthened by the\r\nfact that Jack[89] reports that seeds from the purple-leaved plum have\r\nproduced plants which agree in all essential particulars with the\r\nspecies; while Kerr[90] has grown a purple-leaved plum from a variety of\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_.\r\n\r\nBesides this well-known purple-leaved plum nurserymen offer _Prunus\r\npendula_, a weeping form; _Prunus planteriensis_, bearing double white\r\nand red flowers; _Prunus acutifolia_, a plum with narrow, willow-like\r\nleaves; _Prunus contorta_, characterized by twisted, contorted foliage;\r\n_Prunus elegans_, _Prunus gigantea_, and a variety with yellow and\r\nanother with variegated leaves, etc. All of these are probably\r\nhorticultural varieties of _Prunus cerasifera_ though some of them cannot\r\nbe classified with surety.\r\n\r\nSchneider[91] calls _Prunus dasycarpa_ Ehrhart,[92] the _Prunus armeniaca\r\ndasycarpa_ of Borkhausen,[93] a cross between _Prunus cerasifera_ and\r\n_Prunus armeniaca_, one of the apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n=7.= =PRUNUS MONTICOLA= K.

Of plums commonly grown in America it is not very closely\r\nrelated to any unless it be _Prunus simonii_. There are several plums\r\nfrom eastern and central Asia with which we are not at all familiar in\r\nAmerica that may show relationship with _Prunus triflora_, chief of which\r\nare _Prunus ichangana_ Schneider,[94] _Prunus thibetica_ Franchet[95] and\r\n_Prunus bokhariensis_ Royle,[96] the last a cultivated plum from northern\r\nIndia. These, in herbarium specimens, have some characters reminding one\r\nof _Prunus triflora_, others of _Prunus domestica_ and still others, of\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_.\r\n\r\nThe Triflora, or Japanese,[97] plums are now cultivated in all parts of\r\nthe world where plums are grown; yet outside of Japan and China they\r\nhave been grown for their fruit less than half a century. Despite the\r\nfact that these plums have been grown in Asia for several centuries the\r\nwild form is not known. Indeed, there are doubts in the minds of some as\r\nto whether it constitutes a distinct species, Maximowicz, an authority\r\non the flora of Japan, among others, holding that it is but a form of\r\n_Prunus domestica_. Roxburgh in naming it gave but little definite\r\ninformation in regard to the species, but the herbarium specimens of\r\nhis in the Kew Herbarium are readily identified as identical with our\r\nJapanese plums.[98] The confusion between _Prunus triflora_ and _Prunus\r\ndomestica_ seems needless, as the points of difference between these two\r\nspecies are several and very distinct and constant, the resemblances\r\nbetween _Prunus triflora_ and some of the American species being much\r\ncloser. So, too, the effort, sometimes made, to make more than one\r\nspecies out of _Prunus triflora_ is straining a point, for though the\r\ntypes under cultivation vary considerably yet the variations are not\r\ngreater than between varieties of other species of the genus Prunus.\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ is almost certainly a native of China. According to\r\nGeorgeson and Sargent, who have made extensive botanical explorations in\r\nthe forests of Japan, there are no indigenous plum trees in that country.\r\nDr. K. Miyake, botanist at the Agricultural College of the Imperial\r\nUniversity, Tokyo, Japan, writes to this Station,[99] that _Prunus\r\ntriflora_ does not grow wild in Japan but was introduced there from China\r\nfrom two to four hundred years ago. Bretschneider[100] in his treatise\r\non _The Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works_ says that the plum\r\nhas been cultivated from ancient times in China and this indicates that\r\nthe original habitat was in that country. Mr. F. N. Meyer, Agricultural\r\nExplorer for the United States Department of Agriculture, who has made\r\nextensive agricultural explorations in China, writes[101] that he has\r\nseen many trees of _Prunus triflora_ cultivated in the Chekiang Province\r\nand also about Canton but that he had not found the species growing wild.\r\nRoxburgh says[102] that the shrub had been “received from China into\r\nour gardens in Bengal.” Forbes and Hemsley[103] state that varieties of\r\nthis plum are cultivated in China and that it occurs in the wild state\r\nin the mountains near Peking as well as on the Tsunglin range in Shensi\r\nand Kansu. These writers are, however, uncertain as to where it is truly\r\nindigenous.\r\n\r\nWhile the above and practically all evidence points to China as the\r\noriginal home of _Prunus triflora_ it is likely that the habitat of the\r\nspecies cannot be accurately determined until western and southwestern\r\nChina have been explored by botanists, these regions as yet being almost\r\nunknown to foreign scientists.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the illustrious work of Kaempfer, Thunberg, Siebold and\r\nFortune in sending to Europe the choicest plants of Japan and China,\r\n_Prunus triflora_ seems to have reached the Old World through America\r\nat a very recent date. At least the species was not cultivated for its\r\nfruit in Europe until introduced from the United States as Japanese\r\nplums, and even yet they are but barely known in European orchards.\r\nThe species was introduced into this country from Japan about 1870 by a\r\nMr. Hough of Vacaville, California. According to Bailey,[104] who has\r\ngiven much attention to these plums, Mr. Hough obtained his trees from\r\na Mr. Bridges, United States Consul to Japan. John Kelsey, Berkeley,\r\nCalifornia, produced the first ripe fruit of the Triflora plums in\r\nAmerica in 1876 and 1877, and impressed by their value began recommending\r\nthem. Owing to Mr. Kelsey’s efforts the propagation of these plums was\r\nbegun on a large scale about 1883 by W. P. Hammon & Co., of Oakland,\r\nwho commemorated Mr. Kelsey’s labors by naming the plum after him.\r\nThe success of the Kelsey started the importation and origination of\r\nvarieties and a veritable boom in Japanese plums was soon under way.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is a most valuable addition to our pomology, no less than\r\nninety-two varieties now being under cultivation in America. At first it\r\nwas thought desirable only for the southern states, but it proved to be\r\nnearly as hardy as the Domestica plums in the northern states and was\r\nsoon widely distributed north and south. Beyond question it has suffered\r\nfrom over-praise, which has led to over-planting. As was of necessity the\r\ncase, many untested and worthless varieties were offered fruit-growers,\r\nand these, with the failure of some of the extravagant claims for the\r\nreally meritorious varieties, have given the Triflora plums a bad\r\nreputation with many fruit-growers. Now we have cultivated plums of this\r\nspecies for forty years and there has been time for the excitement of\r\ntheir discovery and the consequent reaction to abate making it possible\r\nto arrive more nearly at their true place in pomology.\r\n\r\nThe plums of this species possess several striking features that commend\r\nthem to fruit-growers. Undoubtedly the most valuable attribute of the\r\nTriflora plums as cultivated fruits is their wide range of adaptability.\r\nAll must admit that this group of varieties is less valuable than the\r\nDomestica varieties where both succeed, but the Triflora plums are\r\nadapted to a much wider range of country and of conditions than the\r\nDomesticas. But even where both types of plums succeed the newer plum\r\nintroduces several very desirable features quite aside from additional\r\nvariety which the many distinct sorts furnish. Thus, as a species, the\r\nTrifloras are more vigorous, productive, earlier in coming in bearing\r\nand more free from diseases, especially black-knot and leaf-blight, than\r\nthe Domestica plums. The Trifloras are also less subject to curculio\r\nthan most of the native and European species. They keep longer and ship\r\nas well as the better known Europeans. As compared with native varieties\r\nthe plums from Japan are larger, handsomer and better flavored and keep\r\nand ship better. Some disadvantages are that they blossom so early as to\r\nbe often caught by spring frosts; they are quite subject to brown-rot;\r\nfor most part they are tenacious clingstones; the species, all in all, is\r\nless hardy to cold than the Domestica plums; lastly, they are inferior\r\nin quality to the varieties from Europe. The last fault is so serious\r\nthat, though the average for the Triflora plums is high, making them\r\nunquestionably more desirable inhabitants of the orchard than any of the\r\nnative species, they cannot compete with the Domesticas where the two\r\ntypes can be equally well grown.\r\n\r\nThe botanical differences between these Asiatic plums and those from\r\nEurope and America are most interesting. In 1859 Asa Gray called\r\nattention to the striking resemblances between the east coast floras of\r\nAsia and America. The Triflora plum is one of the plants which furnishes\r\nsubstantial evidence of this similarity and of the dissimilarity of the\r\neast and west coast floras of the two hemispheres. In general aspect\r\nthe trees of the Triflora plums in summer or winter are much more like\r\nthose of the American species than like those from Europe or West Asia;\r\nso, too, the fruits are more alike in appearance and in quality, and the\r\npeach-like foliage of the Trifloras might easily be mistaken for that\r\nof some of our varieties of Hortulana or Munsoniana. In the manner in\r\nwhich the buds are borne and in vernation the resemblance of the Oriental\r\nspecies to the Americanas, Hortulanas and Munsonianas is again most\r\nstriking. In Asiatic and American species the buds are borne in twos\r\nand threes, while in the European species they are more often single or\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this similarity of the Triflora plums to the most\r\ncommon American species is seen when Gray’s reason for the likenesses\r\nbetween the two floras is considered. This, briefly, is that similar\r\ntypes of post-glacial plants should persist in areas having like\r\ngeographical positions and like climates; hence east-coast plants in one\r\nhemisphere should be expected to be similar to those of the east coast\r\nof the other hemisphere and the same with the west coast. Triflora plums\r\nare near of kin to American plums, then, because they have been evolved\r\nunder similar conditions. This is a reason why these plums from Japan are\r\nadapted to so wide a range of country in America, and why, too, they are\r\nso free from the fungus troubles which attack European plums, but from\r\nwhich American plums suffer but little.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from their nearness of kin the Triflora plums\r\nhybridize readily with the American species and especially with the\r\nHortulanas and Munsonianas, the species they most resemble. Unfortunately\r\nan amalgamation of the Oriental plums with the Americanas is not so\r\neasily accomplished and that with the Domesticas is still more difficult.\r\nHybrids with _Prunus simonii_ are easily made and the progeny as a rule\r\nhave much merit. Hybrids of the Trifloras with our native species give\r\nmost promising results, a number of them being described in _The Plums of\r\nNew York_. The fact that the Trifloras have been cultivated for several\r\ncenturies, at least, means in their hybridization with American species\r\nthat there is an amalgamation of domesticated characters with the similar\r\nbut wilder characters of our native species.\r\n\r\nIt has been very difficult to establish a satisfactory nomenclature for\r\nthe Triflora plums now grown in America. In spite of the excellent work\r\nof Berckmans,[105] Bailey[106] and Waugh,[107] in bringing order out of\r\nwhat was at one time utter confusion, there is still a great deal of\r\nuncertainty as to the identification of some varieties. The confusion\r\nbegan with the first extensive importation of these plums from Japan when\r\nnames which the Japanese applied to classes or groups or the localities\r\nfrom which the plums came were made to apply in America to definite\r\nvarieties. Many of the names under which the plums were imported have\r\nhad to be dropped and the varieties boldly renamed. Another source of\r\nconfusion has been that these, of all plums, seem most variable under\r\nchanged conditions. Local environment in many instances in America\r\nchanges somewhat the habit and appearance of varieties, making it\r\ndifficult to decide whether two or more specimens of the same sort from\r\ndifferent localities are identical varieties or distinct. Curiously\r\nenough, too, the trees of some varieties of plums seem to bear unlike\r\nfruit in different years, especially in the matter of time of ripening;\r\nthat is, trees of some varieties do not always ripen their fruit in the\r\nsame sequence, being earlier than another variety one year and possibly\r\nlater the next. All fruits are more or less variable in this respect,\r\nbut the Triflora plums are remarkably so, a fact that has added to the\r\nconfusion in their nomenclature, since it adds to the difficulty of\r\nidentifying varieties.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated varieties of _Prunus triflora_ are also very diverse as\r\nregards tree-characters, especially as to vigor, hardiness and time of\r\nmaturity of the fruit. The differences seem to be horticultural or those\r\nthat come from cultivation, rather than botanical. Indeed, it seems\r\nimpossible to place the numerous varieties in horticultural groups that\r\nare marked with any great degree of definiteness. A distinction of groups\r\nbased on color is sometimes made, but the one character is insufficient\r\nto have classificatory value. In Japan, according to Georgeson, a\r\ndivision of the species is made with shape as the line of division. He\r\nsays[108] “The round plums are designated by the term botankio, while\r\nthose of an oval or pointed shape are called hattankio.” The varieties\r\nare sometimes loosely grouped into yellow and red-fleshed sorts. A\r\nserviceable classification would have to be founded on several or a\r\nconsiderable number of characters. Such a classification at present is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=9.= =PRUNUS SIMONII= Carrière\r\n\r\n    =1.= Carrière _Rev.

The spontaneous form\r\nhas not as yet been found. The general aspect of the tree is more that\r\nof the peach than the plum and the drupes are as much like apricots or\r\nnectarines as plums but when all characters are considered the fruit can\r\nbetter be classed with the plums than with any of the other stone-fruits\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n_Prunus simonii_ has been widely grown in America both for its fruits\r\nand as an ornamental, but it cannot be said that it has become popular\r\nfor either purpose and only one variety of the species is now under\r\ncultivation. As a food product the plums lack palatability and as\r\nornamentals the trees are subject to too many pests. _Prunus simonii_\r\nhas been successfully hybridized with _Prunus triflora_ and as secondary\r\ncrosses its blood has been mingled with that of some of the native\r\nspecies as well. Most of its hybrid offspring have more value than the\r\nparent, nearly all of them lacking its disagreeable taste. According to\r\nan article published in _Revue Horticole_[110] a new form of the _Prunus\r\nsimonii_ was produced in 1890 from a bud sport, the fruit of which is\r\nelongated, a little cordate, slightly unequal, and grooved on one side.\r\nSo far as can be learned this sport has no very decided merits as a\r\nhorticultural plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=10.= =PRUNUS AMERICANA= Marshall\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS AMERICANA_]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Marshall _Arb.

The plums of this species in the Mississippi Valley are\r\ndistinguished from the eastern and typical form by fruits having a length\r\ngreater than the diameter, by a somewhat different aspect of tree and by\r\nflatter seeds which are usually conspicuously longer than broad. All of\r\nthe cultivated varieties come from the western form. The plant of _Prunus\r\namericana_ in the dry plain regions in Kansas and Nebraska becomes\r\nshrubby in character while on the alluvial bottom lands along the streams\r\nin this region it retains the character of a tree. In the southern limit\r\nof its range, the leaves of this species are more or less pubescent on\r\nthe lower surface. As the species occurs throughout western New Mexico,\r\nColorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana and Manitoba, it differs enough,\r\npossibly, from the eastern types to be considered a sub-species, having\r\na wholly different aspect of tree, silvery and somewhat scurfy twigs,\r\nsmaller, thinner and lighter colored leaves and smaller fruits with more\r\nroundish stones.\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_ is the predominating native plum. It is the most\r\nwidely distributed, is most abundant in individual specimens and has\r\nyielded the largest number of horticultural varieties of any of the\r\nnative species. Because of its prominence and comparatively high degree\r\nof permanency of characters it may well be considered the type from\r\nwhich has sprung not only its botanical varieties but several other of\r\nthe American species. Its variability, too, is shown in its many diverse\r\nhorticultural varieties, and of its adaptability it may be said that\r\nit flourishes on nearly all soils and exposures, and is found wild or\r\ncultivated from Maine to Florida and northward from Mexico along the\r\neastern slope of the Rocky Mountains well into Canada. The species was\r\nwell named by Marshall “Americana.”\r\n\r\nThis plum has not played nearly as important a part in the pomology of\r\nAmerica as its merits would warrant. It seems to have made an impression\r\nalmost from the first upon the Europeans who settled America, for it is\r\nmentioned in nearly all the early records of the food products of the\r\nnewly found land, yet its cultivation can hardly be said to have begun\r\nuntil the last half of the Nineteenth Century. But the early descriptions\r\nof this and other native plums by the colonial explorers, naturalists\r\nand botanists, show but little interest in these fruits as subjects for\r\ncultivation, and seem to contain almost no prophecies as to the possible\r\ndevelopment of a new orchard plant from them. It is probable that the\r\nDamsons, which were early introduced in America, and the Domesticas,\r\nwhich came at least before the Revolution, proved so adaptable to the\r\npart of the New World in which the colonies were planted that this, even\r\nthough the best of the wild plums, offered small reward in comparison.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that from the very first, Americana plums were\r\nmuch used by the early settlers as wild fruits, for the histories of all\r\nthe colonies and states in which plums are found contain innumerable\r\nreferences to wild plums, usually with some expression showing that they\r\nwere considered makeshifts until the European plums could be grown. Long\r\nbefore white men came to America the possessors of the continent knew\r\nand esteemed these fruits of the woods. According to some of the early\r\nwriters wild plums of this species, since found where the Americanas are\r\ndominant, were planted and rudely cultivated by the natives.[111] It is\r\nlikely, however, that these Indian orchards were more often the result\r\nof seeds dropped about camping places and towns rather than regularly\r\nplanted orchards. It is not improbable that the wide distribution of this\r\nspecies in the Mississippi Valley and the country about and beyond the\r\nGreat Lakes is due somewhat to the hand of the Indian, of the voyageur\r\nand of the missionary of the French regime.\r\n\r\nThe common names under which this plum passes in the states where it is\r\nfound as a wild fruit are indicative of the knowledge possessed of it\r\nby the people. The Americana is nearly always the wild plum of eastern\r\nAmerica. It shares with several other species the names in various parts\r\nof the country of Red Plum, Yellow Plum, the Horse and the Hog Plum. In\r\nIowa this is most often the “native plum;” in Indiana it is the Goose\r\nplum; in Georgia, the August plum, while in the states bordering on the\r\nGulf it is often called the Sloe.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of Americana plums is due to the fact that the plums\r\nof Europe will not thrive in the Mississippi Valley, the prairie states,\r\nnor, for the most part, in the South. The European species are tender\r\nboth to cold and heat in these regions and they are attacked by those\r\nscourges of plum culture, black-knot, leaf-blight and curculio. If,\r\nthen, the people in the West and South were to have plums at hand when\r\nwanted, the wild species had to be brought under cultivation. Where the\r\ntwo will grow side by side it is doubtful if any would choose to grow the\r\nAmericanas in preference to the Europeans or even for the sake of variety.\r\n\r\nThe Americana plum was introduced into European gardens at an early\r\ndate, for references to it are found in the pomological works of the\r\nEighteenth Century, Duhamel having described it in his great work on\r\npomology in 1768, under the name _Prunier de Virginie_, and later\r\nPoiteau[112] gives a very good description of it under the name _Prune de\r\nla Gallissioniere_. Just how much earlier than these dates it was taken\r\nto the Old World cannot be said, but seeds of it are likely to have been\r\ntaken there by some of the returning explorers of early colonial times.\r\nThe important fact is that as a cultivated fruit it has made absolutely\r\nno headway in competition in Europe with the plums of that continent\r\nthough it is to be found not infrequently as an ornamental.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of these plums began less than a century ago, not\r\nthrough direct efforts in breeding them but as the result of the\r\nselection of the best of the wild or chance trees found in many widely\r\nseparated localities. It would be most interesting to follow in\r\ndetail the introduction of variety after variety of this species into\r\ncultivation, giving full credit to the men, many of them pioneers in\r\nnewly settled countries, through whose efforts the amelioration of the\r\nspecies was begun. But space forbids, and the reader who desires to trace\r\nmore fully the history and the evolution of these plums must put together\r\nthe histories of the two or three hundred varieties of Americanas\r\ndescribed in the chapters on varieties.\r\n\r\nAre the Americanas to compete with the Domesticas, Insititias and\r\nTrifloras where all may be grown? It is very doubtful or at least not\r\nsoon. The Old World plums are so superior, speaking generally, in size,\r\nappearance, and flavor, the qualities which appeal to those who eat\r\nplums, that the native varieties stand small chance for popular favor.\r\nTheir place in pomology must long remain the region where the older and\r\nmore highly developed groups of plums cannot be grown. Though there are\r\nnow many times more of the Americana plums under cultivation than of the\r\nrecently introduced Trifloras, the latter are more popular and are likely\r\nto remain so in localities where both can be grown.\r\n\r\nThe range of _Prunus americana_ is seemingly increasing, making it almost\r\nimpossible to give its present limits. The boundary line of its northern\r\nrange passes through central New York to central Michigan, southern\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota extending northwestward to Manitoba\r\nand reaching its western limit in Utah. It occurs locally southward\r\nthrough Colorado to northern New Mexico. It is rare in Oklahoma and\r\ndoes not occur in Texas, but is represented in Missouri by a pubescent\r\nform. East of the Mississippi River the typical species occurs in all\r\nof the states from central New York southward to northern Florida. In\r\nthis great territory it is found in many diverse soils and exposures\r\nbut responding in all to good soil and congenial environment. In the\r\nwild state the Americana plums are most often found along the borders of\r\nstreams and swamps or in bottom lands where moisture abounds. Sometimes\r\nthey are found in swamps which may be submerged a part of the year. In\r\nspite of a predilection for moist lands, however, the wild plants are\r\nnot infrequently found on comparatively dry uplands, seeming to prefer\r\nsoils containing considerable lime. The wild trees are usually found in\r\nthickets, often of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nUnder cultivation the range is even greater than for the wild plant. It\r\nis only in localities of extreme heat and cold, humidity or aridness,\r\nthat some of the many Americanas cannot be made to grow under conditions\r\nat all favorable for orchards of any of the temperate fruits. So, too,\r\nvarieties may be found for nearly all soils which permit of cultivation.\r\nThis freedom from local attachments is one of the chief assets of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe Americana tree is commonly small, often but a bush, and usually\r\nwith a thick, thorny top. Generally the head attains a height of about\r\nfifteen or eighteen feet and sometimes it rises to twenty-five or thirty\r\nfeet, spreading into many rigid branches which are often pendulous at\r\nthe extremities. The species may almost always be told by the rough,\r\nshaggy, grayish bark, the large, thin, persistent plates of which give\r\na very characteristic shagginess. In the spring the tree is covered\r\nwith umbelliferous masses of pure white flowers and both at this season\r\nand later with its ample foliage or showy fruit, the plant is very\r\nornamental. The leaves are large, oval or obovate, thin, dull and veiny,\r\nwith very jagged margins.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is reddish or yellowish or a blending of the two with the red\r\nvarieties predominating. Often the color is more nearly orange than red\r\nor yellow—in fact pure yellow fruits cannot be found. Wild or cultivated\r\nthe fruits of the Americana plums vary greatly in season, size, shape\r\nand flavor. In the orchard the period of maturity covers a range of\r\nseveral weeks, beginning in New York in August and ending in October; in\r\nthe wild, trees in the same thicket may vary as much as three weeks in\r\nripening their fruit. The size of the cultivated sorts is from that of\r\na Damson to that of some of the Gages, the shape being roundish-oval,\r\nor quite oval, sometimes oblique and sometimes truncate at one or both\r\nends and often more or less compressed. The wild fruits usually have\r\na pleasant flavor and this is much improved under cultivation so that\r\nwhen fully ripe the flesh of some sorts is sweet and luscious, hardly\r\nsurpassed, if the skin be rejected, by the best Domesticas. The skin\r\nis usually thick, coriaceous, acerb or astringent, and altogether very\r\nunpleasant, making with the tenaciously clinging stones the chief\r\ndefects of these fruits. In some varieties skin and stones are far less\r\nobjectionable than in others.\r\n\r\nThe trees of the varieties we have as yet are not very manageable in the\r\norchard. They make a very slow growth and are hard to control, producing\r\nat maturity many leaning trunks which are often crooked, as are also the\r\nbranches which, with the unkempt heads, give an impression of waywardness\r\nand wildness. Nearly all of the varieties over-bear and unless\r\nthinned the fruits are so small as to be hardly worth harvesting; not\r\ninfrequently trees die from over-bearing. A few varieties are unfruitful\r\nbut usually because of defective pollination. Nearly all sucker badly\r\non their own roots, and except in cold regions should be grown on other\r\nstocks. In general there are fewer pests to combat with these than with\r\nthe European plums but yet they are far from being exempt and require on\r\nthe grounds of this Station quite as much spraying as do other plums.\r\n\r\nWaugh, who has given the subject much study, claims that the Americanas\r\nare not very strong sexually,[113] chiefly because of defective\r\nreproductive organs. He found in extensive examinations that 21.2 per ct.\r\nof the pistils were defective, ranging from nothing in some varieties\r\nto 100 per ct. in others. More seldom the anthers were defective\r\nand the flowers were sometimes proterandrous (the pollen maturing\r\nbefore the pistil is ready to receive it), and that they were rather\r\nfrequently proterogynous (the pistils receptive before the pollen is\r\nmature). Waugh holds that in planting these plums, provision should be\r\nmade for cross-pollination, and recommends as sorts most suitable for\r\ninter-planting for this purpose, other varieties of the same species.\r\n\r\nPlant-breeders have not found that this species hybridizes as readily\r\nas most of the other cultivated native plums. This is chiefly due to\r\na seeming lack of affinity for other species. Nevertheless there are\r\nnumerous Americana hybrids, and it is likely that as the high quality of\r\nthe fruit and the hardiness of the trees become better known they will be\r\nused much more for hybridizing.\r\n\r\nThe Americana plums are all hardy and some of the varieties can be grown\r\nas far north as general agriculture is practiced. These, with the Nigras,\r\nwill probably always be the chief groups for dry, cold regions between\r\nthe Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains. They may also be relied upon in\r\nthe colder parts of New York and New England. The flower-buds as well\r\nas the trees are hardy, having been known to withstand a temperature of\r\nforty degrees below zero. Goff[114] reports that in the winter of 1896-7\r\nthe flower-buds of Domestica varieties on the grounds of the Wisconsin\r\nExperiment Station were almost totally destroyed though the minimum\r\ntemperature recorded was only twenty-three degrees below zero, but the\r\nflower-buds of Americana varieties were not at all injured. Since the\r\nblossoms open comparatively late there is less damage from spring frosts\r\nin this than in most other species even of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties of Americana plums is a testimonial to the\r\nmerits of the species. There are about 260 varieties of them more or\r\nless disseminated. There are many divergent types of these and since\r\nall are far from what may be eventually expected from the species the\r\nnumber of varieties will undoubtedly greatly increase and in still\r\nother directions. In the meantime the great majority have fallen by the\r\nwayside. The weeding-out process seems to be in this case the chief agent\r\nof progression. A fault with the varieties now before the public is that\r\nmany of them are so similar that a difference can hardly be detected. The\r\nelimination of the great majority of the varieties of this species now in\r\nthe catalogs and a much more judicious selection of varieties for future\r\ndissemination would relieve pomology of the burden it now carries in the\r\nnumerous sorts of Americanas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS AMERICANA MOLLIS=[115] Torrey and Gray\r\n\r\n    =1.= Torrey and Gray _Fl.

The\r\nleaves, petioles and shoots of this plum are soft-pubescent, almost\r\ntomentose, the tomentum being pale in color and usually very dense; the\r\ncalyx-lobes are pubescent on both sides and the pedicels are appressed\r\nand densely pubescent. According to Bailey, there is a form of this\r\nsub-species “with flowers as completely double as those of St. Peter’s\r\nwreath, or similar spireas.” This double-flowering plum we have not seen.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give the range of _Prunus americana mollis_ as the\r\nwoolly-leaved plum of the west gradually passes into the smooth-leaved\r\nspecies of the east and the two forms are not infrequently mixed in the\r\nSouth and Southwest; or possibly it would be better to say that they run\r\ninto each other though the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct as to\r\nbe readily mistaken for separate species. It can only be said that it\r\nis to be found in the greatest abundance in the region extending from\r\nsouthern Iowa through Missouri. Only two varieties of this plum, Wolf and\r\nVan Buren, are in general cultivation, both of which originated in Iowa.\r\nIn neither fruit nor tree-characters do these differ greatly from the\r\nAmericana plums.\r\n\r\nA plum with pubescent leaves belonging to the Americana series\r\nknown locally as the Big Tree plum, occurs from western Tennessee,\r\nsouth-westward through the extreme southern portion of Missouri, through\r\nArkansas, southern Oklahoma, extending westward in central Texas, at\r\nleast, as far as the Colorado River and reaching its southwestern limit\r\nin northern Mexico. From specimens of this plum in several herbaria and\r\nfrom studies made of it in the field by W. F. Wight of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, it would seem that this plum is a distinct\r\nspecies, its chief distinguishing character being the great size attained\r\nby the tree. So far as it is known the Big Tree has no cultivated forms\r\nunless it be Bilona, supposed to be a hybrid between this species and\r\n_Prunus triflora_, now growing on the grounds of F. T. Ramsey, Austin,\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=11. PRUNUS HORTULANA= Bailey[116]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS HORTULANA_]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bailey _Gar. and For._ =5=:90. 1892. =2.= Sargent _Sil.\r\n    N.

These, Waugh says, “form an unbroken series from _Prunus\r\namericana_ to _Prunus angustifolia_.” The fourth of Waugh’s groups,\r\n“comparatively distinct from the others, is made up of such varieties\r\nas Wayland, Moreman, Golden Beauty, Reed, Leptune, Kanawha and others.”\r\nThese plums he designated as the “Wayland group.” This disposition of the\r\nplums under consideration leaves _Prunus hortulana_ as the name of only a\r\nrather loosely related lot of cultivated varieties. It is probable that\r\nneither Bailey nor Waugh, had they seen the material now to be had, would\r\nhave left the species as they did.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of herbarium material to show that _Prunus\r\nhortulana_ as originally described by Bailey, with the varieties\r\nnamed as the type, leaving out Wild Goose, which is but doubtfully\r\nincluded, and as represented by Waugh’s “Wayland group,” is to be found\r\nwild in Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee, Missouri and\r\nnorthern Arkansas, Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. The writer has\r\nnot seen material from states adjoining those named but the species is\r\nprobably more widely spread than the range given indicates. Further,\r\nthe cultivated varieties named by Bailey as members of his species,\r\nto which should be added at least American Golden, Benson, Columbia,\r\nCrimson Beauty, Dunlap, Kanawha, Leptune, Moreman, Reed, Wayland and\r\nWorld Beater, are so similar in all their characters and constitute a\r\ngroup so distinct from any other species that it is impossible to place\r\nthem otherwise than in a distinct species. A group of hybrids could\r\nhardly be so uniform, and, moreover, these varieties contain characters,\r\nlike late blooming, late fruiting, color, texture and flavor of fruit,\r\nleaf-serrations and deposits of red cork-cells in the bark, which other\r\nnative species do not have, thereby shutting out the probability of the\r\nhybridity theory in which the supposed parents are _Prunus americana_\r\nand _Prunus angustifolia_. Lastly, and most convincing, varieties of\r\nthe species come true to seed, which of course, would not be the case\r\nwere these plums hybrids. From seed borne in 1893 this Station has had\r\nsix seedlings of World Beater and four of Golden Beauty attain the age\r\nof sixteen years with more or less fruit for thirteen successive years.\r\nThe seedlings could hardly be distinguished from the parents and showed\r\nno pronounced characters of either of the species of which _Prunus\r\nhortulana_ has been supposed to be the hybrid offspring.\r\n\r\nOf the sixteen varieties named as certainly belonging to this species,\r\nten came from wild plants or seeds. Two of the remainder came from\r\nplanted seeds and the origin of the remaining four is not known. One of\r\nthe varieties from the wild, Golden Beauty, if its history as commonly\r\ngiven is correct, came from the Colorado River in western Texas. The\r\nGolden Beauty now under cultivation almost certainly belongs to _Prunus\r\nhortulana_, though it differs somewhat from other varieties of the group,\r\nbut how it could have come from the wild in western Texas, so far from\r\nthe usual range of the species, is at present unexplainable. This and\r\nother idiosyncrasies of distribution were reasons given by Bailey and\r\nWaugh for calling this species a group of hybrids. A careful study of\r\nlocalities from which all other Hortulana varieties than Golden Beauty\r\nhave come shows them to be well within the range of _Prunus hortulana_.\r\nThe fact that Golden Beauty is perfectly hardy at Geneva, and according\r\nto Waugh fairly so at Burlington, Vermont, suggests either that what we\r\nhave as Golden Beauty did not originate in south central Texas or that\r\nthe plant from which it came must have been introduced there within\r\ncomparatively recent times.\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana_ gives to American pomology a very distinct and\r\nvaluable group of plums which fortunately are adapted to a wide range\r\nof conditions, especially of climate. The Hortulanas are particularly\r\nwell suited to the Mississippi Valley and southern states and fruit well\r\nas far north and east as New York. The product of Wayland, Kanawha and\r\nGolden Beauty, best known of the plums under discussion, is especially\r\nsuitable for preserves, spicing and jelly, being unsurpassed by any other\r\nof our plums excepting the Damsons for these purposes. They are quite\r\ntoo acid and the flesh clings too tenaciously to the stone for dessert\r\nplums or even for ordinary culinary purposes. These plums, having firm\r\nflesh and tough skins, ship and keep splendidly and since they are the\r\nlatest of the native plums in ripening, extend the season for this fruit\r\nvery materially. The Wayland-like plums make very good stocks upon which\r\nmay be grafted not only the varieties of the same species but those of\r\nthe other native species as well. A point of especial merit with these\r\nplums as stocks is that they do not sucker as do most other species.\r\nUnfortunately they cannot be propagated from cuttings and the difficulty\r\nof obtaining seed at present precludes their use very generally. The\r\nHortulana plums hybridize freely with other native species and their\r\nhybrids are such as to commend this species very highly to plum-breeders\r\nfor hybridization.\r\n\r\nWaugh[119] has given the name _Prunus hortulana robusta_ to a group of\r\nhybrid plums of which _Prunus triflora_ and various native varieties are\r\nthe parents. For most part these hybrids resemble the American more than\r\nthe Asiatic parent. Since these plums differ so among themselves it is\r\ndoubtful if more can be said as to the characters of Waugh’s group than\r\nto mention the above resemblance. Some thirty or more varieties fall into\r\nthis group of which America, Golden, Juicy, Ruby, Waugh and Gonzales are\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS HORTULANA MINERI= Bailey\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS HORTULANA MINERI_]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bailey _Cornell Sta.

It is certain that all of\r\nthese plums are intermediate in some characters between the two species\r\nnamed; neither botanists nor pomologists can agree as to whether certain\r\nvarieties belong to the one or the other botanical division. There are,\r\nhowever, in several herbaria, specimens from the wild, and from different\r\nlocalities, that indicate that there is a distinct plum toward the\r\nnorthern limit of the range of _Prunus hortulana_ which, if a natural\r\nhybrid, is of so ancient hybridity that the plants now come measurably\r\ntrue to type. The chief representatives of the Miner-like plums under\r\ncultivation, as Miner, Forest Rose, Prairie Flower and Clinton, are so\r\nlike these wild plums as to lead the writer to believe that Bailey’s\r\nbotanical sub-division is justified and is worth continuing even though\r\na considerable number of the varieties now put with Miner, most of which\r\nhave originated under cultivation, are hybrids and that the wild plums\r\nmay have come from natural hybrids of more or less remote time.\r\n\r\nThe sub-species differs from the species in having shorter, stiffer,\r\nless graceful branches; leaves smaller, thicker, rougher and of a\r\nbluish-green cast; the blossoms of the two are much the same but those of\r\nthe sub-species open a few days earlier; the fruits of the sub-species\r\nare larger than those of the species, lighter red, have more bloom, are\r\nless firm in texture, ripen earlier, yet later than those of any other\r\nspecies, and are quite different in flavor, having more nearly the taste\r\nof the fruit of _Prunus americana_; the stones, as well as the fruits,\r\nare very different, being in the sub-species larger, broader, flatter,\r\nsmoother and less pointed. The differences in fruit and stone, and to\r\nsome extent in the leaves, can be seen if the color-plates of Forest Rose\r\nand Wayland be compared.\r\n\r\nIn fruit-growing, the Miner-like plums behave in general much like the\r\nAmericana plums. In some respects the fruits are an improvement upon\r\nthose of the Americana varieties. For example the skin in the Miner-like\r\nvarieties is usually less tough; is brighter in color and the flavor, in\r\nmost cases, is a little better. These plums seem to be nearly or quite\r\nas hardy as the Americanas and are adapted to quite as wide a range of\r\nsoils. Presumably they have the same value as stocks, though they seem\r\nnot to have been tried for this purpose and they should have equal value\r\nat least in plant-breeding. The trees of the Miner-like plums are rather\r\nmore amenable to domestication than those of _Prunus americana_ having\r\nas orchard plants straighter trunks, more symmetrical and less unkempt\r\ntops and making larger trees. The fruits ripen so late as to make the\r\nvarieties of this group especially valuable in prolonging the season for\r\nplums in regions where native varieties are grown exclusively. About\r\ntwenty varieties of this sub-species are under cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=12.= =PRUNUS NIGRA= Aiton\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS NIGRA_]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Aiton _Hort.

The differences in environment may change these characters, as\r\nindicated above, but they seem very constant in the cultivated varieties\r\nof the groups, most of which come from the west, and therefore sufficient\r\nto segregate this form from the species.\r\n\r\nThe Nigra is the wild plum of Canada. Its most common name, “Canada\r\nPlum,” is distinctly applicable and is here supplanted by “Nigra” only\r\nfor the sake of uniformity. This is undoubtedly the dried plum which\r\nJacques Cartier saw in the canoes of Indians, in his first voyage of\r\ndiscovery up the St. Lawrence in 1534.[120] These primitive prunes,\r\nCartier says, the Indians called “honesta.” In his second voyage, the\r\nnext year, he enumerates among other fruits the plum, “prunier,” growing\r\non the “Ysle de Bacchus,” named from its “Vignes.” Dried plums, we learn\r\nfrom many later accounts, were a staple article of the winter diet of\r\nthe savages. That the Indian tended the trees is probable, for the early\r\nexplorers often record that plantations of plums were found about the\r\naboriginal towns. Undoubtedly the range of this species was greatly\r\nextended by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Nigra is the most northern of the American plums, being an inhabitant\r\nof a region bounded on the north by a line passing from southern New\r\nFoundland westward to the Strait of Mackinac and thence southward to\r\nLansing, Michigan. Its southern boundary can be but illy defined, but\r\nthe species is common in New England, northern New York, where it is\r\nsometimes cultivated about houses, and westward at least as far as the\r\neastern shore of Lake Michigan for the species, while the western form\r\nreaches the western boundary of Minnesota at least. Small[121] reports\r\nit as far south in the Appalachian System as northern Georgia. In the\r\ngreat region outlined above it is distributed in more or less scattered\r\nlocalities, being found usually in the valleys of rivers and streams,\r\nthough often on high lands and in open woods, in the last locations\r\npreferring a limestone formation.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether _Prunus nigra_ should be\r\ngiven specific rank or be united with _Prunus americana_, either as a\r\npart of that species or as a botanical variety of it. Until the revival\r\nby Sargent in 1892 of the name given the group by Aiton in 1789, the\r\nbotanists of the latter half of the Nineteenth Century had for most\r\npart described the two groups under _Prunus americana_. Since Sargent’s\r\nre-establishment of the species, botanists have very generally regarded\r\nit as worthy of the rank. Bailey and Waugh, the leading horticultural\r\nauthorities on plums, however, consider Nigra as but a botanical variety\r\nof Americana. The taxonomic characters of _Prunus nigra_ seem to the\r\nwriters of _The Plums of New York_ to be as distinct as those of several\r\nother of the native species of _Prunus_, and since the species now is\r\ngenerally recognized by botanists, we have considered it in this work as\r\ndistinct from _Prunus americana_.\r\n\r\nThe two species may usually be distinguished by the following\r\ndifferences: (1) The general aspect of the trees is very different. The\r\ntree of Americana is larger, the top is more spreading, and its branches\r\nlonger, with more twigs, more slender and more pendulous. The bark on\r\nthe trunk is lighter-colored and much more shaggy than in Nigra. (2) The\r\nwood of Nigra is tougher and the trees do not break as readily as those\r\nof Americana. The wood is also lighter in color. (3) The leaves of Nigra\r\nare larger, broader and the serrations are not so deeply incised nor\r\nso often double. Very distinct and very constant are the glands to be\r\nfound on the teeth of the serrations on the young leaves of Nigra. These\r\nglands disappear as the leaves grow older, leaving a calloused point\r\nwhich makes the serrations of Nigra rounded, while those of Americana\r\nare acute, this being one of the most constant differences. (4) The\r\nflowers of Nigra appear several days earlier, are larger and are more\r\npink than those of Americana. (5) The calyx-lobes of Nigra are glandular\r\nand the leaf-stalks are biglandular, characters usually not found in\r\nAmericana. The calyx in all its parts is glabrous or at least far less\r\npubescent than in Americana and if present the hairs are short and stiff,\r\nwhereas in Americana the pubescence is soft. (6) The fruit of Nigra\r\nripens earlier and is darker in color with less bloom and is more oblong\r\nthan that of Americana. The skin of the plum is thinner and is not so\r\nobjectionable either cooked or eaten out of hand. (7) The stone of Nigra\r\nis usually larger, flatter and more strongly crested. The characters of\r\nthe two species vary much in different individuals and there are many\r\nintermediate forms but the differences seem as constant as between other\r\nspecies of this variable genus.\r\n\r\nThe Nigra plums are important horticulturally because they can be grown\r\nin somewhat colder regions than the Americanas. They not only endure\r\nmore cold than the last named group, but their tough wood enables them\r\nto stand better the weight of snows and the stress of winds. Their\r\nearliness, too, prolongs the season for this type of fruit and in regions\r\nwhere the season is short they may be grown with more certainty than\r\nother groups. In habits and characters other than those named they are\r\nso like the Americana as to need no further discussion. About forty\r\nvarieties of this species are under cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=13.= =PRUNUS ALLEGHANIENSIS= Porter\r\n\r\n    =1.= Porter _Bot.

The species has long been known to be distinct, however,\r\nhaving been first distinguished by J. R. Lowrie of Warriorsmark,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1859,[122] and was published as such in 1877, when T.\r\nC. Porter of Lafayette College described it as _Prunus alleghaniensis_.\r\nIt differs from _Prunus americana_ chiefly in the smaller size of the\r\nplant, smaller leaves and flowers, in color of flowers which fade to pink\r\nin this species, and in fruit-characters. The fruit matures earlier, is\r\nmuch smaller in size, is more globose, and is a dark purple or blue with\r\nvery heavy bloom. The skin is thick and tough and while the texture of\r\nthe flesh is as good as that of the wild Americanas the flavor is much\r\nmore astringent. The stone is more swollen. The plant is commonly but\r\na shrub, usually found along fence rows and the borders of woodlands,\r\nbut intermingled among old thickets of this kind there are often a few\r\nsmall trees. It is a hardy species, very productive, and seemingly but\r\nlittle attacked by either insects or fungi, being especially exempt from\r\nblack-knot.[123] In the wild state it produces great numbers of suckers\r\nwhich seem to spring very readily from a bruise or an exposed root.\r\n\r\nThe range of _Prunus alleghaniensis_ is exceedingly limited. It is found\r\nin abundance only in a small territory in central Pennsylvania, being of\r\nmost frequent occurrence in the barrens of northern Huntingdon County,\r\nextending from there north into Center County and northwestward over the\r\nAlleghany Mountains into Clearfield and Elk counties. It grows for the\r\nmost part in elevated lands of the wildest character, being found on low,\r\nmoist soils, on high and dry barrens and on limestone cliffs, reaching\r\nits greatest size in the last situation.\r\n\r\nSpecimens identified as _Prunus alleghaniensis_ have been found in at\r\nleast two places in Connecticut and the writer has just seen specimens\r\nof a closely allied form collected by W. F. Wight of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture a few miles south of Houghton Lake, Roscommon\r\nCounty, Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis plum is not yet introduced into cultivation and it is doubtful if\r\nthe wild fruits have sufficient merit to make an attempt at domestication\r\npromising. While the wild fruits are locally used for various culinary\r\npurposes it is so much inferior to other native plums, being almost\r\nuneatable unless cooked, that its cultivation would hardly warrant\r\nthe effort. Arboretum specimens of the tree show it to be somewhat\r\ndesirable as an ornamental, being a small, compact, upright plant, very\r\nfloriferous, and bearing an abundance of rather attractive fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=14.= =PRUNUS SUBCORDATA= Bentham\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bentham _Pl.

It is so rarely found on the seacoast as to have escaped the\r\nattention of the early botanists and remained unknown until the middle\r\nof the Nineteenth Century, when Hartweg, working in the interior of\r\nCalifornia, brought the plant to notice. This wild plum is not common\r\nexcept in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas in northern California\r\nand southern Oregon, where it often forms thickets of small trees along\r\nstreams, thriving in fresh, fertile, sandy soils, in canons, on hillsides\r\nor in the forests of yellow pine which are found in this region.\r\nHammond[124] writes of it growing here as usually a small tree but often\r\nseen as a shrub from four to five feet high. Of the frequency of the\r\noccurrence he says: “It often sets the whole countryside ablaze in the\r\nautumn, with the abundance of its scarlet and crimson colors, mingled, of\r\ncourse, with red and yellow, and garnished with a sprinkling of green.”\r\nSandberg[125] reports having collected _Prunus subcordata_ as far north\r\nand east as Nez Perces County, northern Idaho, in the Craig Mountains at\r\nan altitude of about 2,900 feet, but this report is based on an error\r\nin determination, the specimen collected by Sandberg being clearly a\r\nEuropean species. The tree and the fruit vary greatly according to the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nThis Subcordata plum is one of the standard food products of the\r\naborigines in the region in which it grows, being eaten either raw or\r\ncooked; and it is sometimes dried in considerable quantities at the\r\nharvesting places and carried considerable distances to the Indian\r\nvillages.[126] The trappers, the first men to enter the habitat of this\r\nplum, followed by the gold-seekers and ranchers, all knew and esteemed\r\nthe fruit. The early settlers regarded it as the most useful of all the\r\nwild fruits of the Coast and attempts were made at an early date to\r\ndomesticate it. Of these Wickson says:[127]\r\n\r\n    “In 1856 there was, on the Middle Yuba River, not far from\r\n    Forest City, in Sierra County, a wayside establishment known as\r\n    ‘Plum Valley Ranch,’ so-called from the great quantity of wild\r\n    plums growing on and about the place. The plum by cultivation\r\n    gave a more vigorous growth and larger fruit. Transplanted\r\n    from the mountains into the valley they are found to ripen\r\n    earlier. Transplanted from the mountains to a farm near the\r\n    coast, in Del Norte County, they did not thrive. One variety,\r\n    moved from the hills near Petaluma in 1858, was grown as an\r\n    orchard tree for fifteen years, and improved both in growth and\r\n    quality of fruit by cultivation.... Recently excellent results\r\n    have been reported from the domestication of the native plum\r\n    in Nevada County, and fruit shown at the State Fair of 1888\r\n    gave assurance that by cultivation and by selecting seedlings\r\n    valuable varieties can be obtained. It is stated that in Sierra\r\n    County the wild plum is the only plum which finds a market at\r\n    good prices, and that cultivated gages, blue and egg plums\r\n    scarcely pay for gathering. The wild plum makes delicious\r\n    preserves.”\r\n\r\nIn its typical form _Prunus subcordata_ is a shrub and is often only\r\na low bush but under the most favorable conditions it attains the\r\ndimension and shape of a small tree. In its roundish, roughish leaves it\r\nso closely resembles the Old World types of plums that it becomes the\r\nnearest approach to them to be found among our American species. But in\r\nthe globular, red or purple subacid fruit it betrays its affinity to the\r\nAmerican plums, as it does also in the flat, sometimes turgid, smooth\r\nstone to which the flesh tenaciously clings. The flowers are white,\r\nfading to rose and borne abundantly, making the plant an attractive\r\nornamental in blooming time as it is also in the autumn when the foliage\r\nturns to brilliant red, scarlet or crimson with touches of yellow. The\r\nfruit is sometimes so poor in quality as to be inedible but on the other\r\nhand is sometimes quite equal to some of the cultivated plums, especially\r\nin its botanical variety, Kelloggii.\r\n\r\nThat the fruit is capable of improvement by the selection of seedling\r\nvarieties and useful in hybridizing with other species can hardly be\r\ndoubted. Luther Burbank, under date of December 6, 1909, writes in this\r\nregard as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The _Prunus subcordata_, as it grows wild, bears very heavily\r\n    even on bushes two and three feet in height, bending the bushes\r\n    flat on the ground when the fruit is ripe. This is a very\r\n    beautiful sight. The wild ones, although almost invariably\r\n    bright red and spherical, are sometimes, though rarely found,\r\n    yellow. When the seed of the yellow fruit is planted a certain\r\n    portion of red ones are produced, but all, practically, of the\r\n    same size and quality as the original. The trees of Subcordata\r\n    in the wild state are greatly variable in growth, generally\r\n    much more so than in the fruit. The fruit, however, varies much\r\n    in quality, but it is promiscuously gathered by those living in\r\n    the vicinity of the plum grounds and considered most excellent\r\n    for cooking. I commenced working on this species about\r\n    twenty-two years ago and have not carried it on as extensively\r\n    as with the Maritima, as I found it subject to plum-pockets,\r\n    but by very careful selection I have produced most magnificent\r\n    plums, oval in form or round, sweet as honey or sweet as the\r\n    French Prune, greatly enlarged in size, tree improved in growth\r\n    and enormously productive, the different varieties ripening\r\n    through a long season. Most of these are light and dark red.\r\n    Some of them, when cooked, are far superior to cranberries,\r\n    having the exact delicious flavor so much liked in this fruit,\r\n    and the same color.\r\n\r\n    “From the crosses of Subcordata with the Americana, Nigra,\r\n    Triflora and other species, some of the most beautiful and\r\n    highest flavored fruits which I have ever seen have been\r\n    produced. These vary in color from almost pure white to\r\n    light yellow, transparent flesh color, pink, light crimson,\r\n    scarlet, dark crimson and purple; in form round, egg-shaped\r\n    or elongated-oval; trees both upright and weeping, enormously\r\n    productive, and in one or two cases the fruit, by hundreds of\r\n    experts, has been pronounced the best plum in flavor of any in\r\n    existence. Most of these selections are extremely productive.”\r\n\r\nWickson[128] reports that the roots of Subcordata have been used more\r\nor less as stocks for other plums but show no marked advantages over\r\nthe species commonly used for this purpose. Most of those who have\r\nexperimented with it condemn it as a stock because it dwarfs the cion and\r\nsuckers badly.\r\n\r\n_Prunus oregana_ Greene[129] is from its description an interesting plum\r\nof which, however, it has been impossible to secure a glimpse even of\r\nherbarium material and of which we can therefore, only publish Greene’s\r\ndescription as follows:\r\n\r\n“Evidently allied to P. _subcordata_, but leaves little more than an inch\r\nlong, subcoriaceous, pubescent on both faces, in outline oval or broadly\r\nelliptic, never subcordate, commonly acutish at both ends, serrulate;\r\nflowers unknown; fruits in pairs or threes, on pedicels one-half inch\r\nlong or more, densely tomentose when very young, more thinly so, yet\r\ndistinctly tomentulose when half-grown.\r\n\r\n“Known only from specimens collected on the Yanex Indian reservation\r\nin southeastern Oregon, by Mrs. Austin, in 1893; and a most remarkable\r\nspecies, as connecting true _Prunus_ with _Amygdalus_. But that it is a\r\nplum and not an almond is evident.”\r\n\r\nWithout any first-hand knowledge of this species it is thought best to\r\nconsider it only under the allied species, _Prunus subcordata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS SUBCORDATA KELLOGGII= Lemmon\r\n\r\n    =1.= Lemmon _Pittonia_ =2=:67. 1890. =2.= Wickson _Calif.

The fruit is bright yellow instead\r\nof red and larger than that of the species, being an inch or more in\r\ndiameter with a more nearly free stone. This plum inhabits the region of\r\nMount Shasta where it has been known since the time of the early gold\r\ndiggers, attracting more attention as a food, and promising more for\r\nthe cultivator than Subcordata. Botanists seem to have given this plum\r\ncomparatively little attention and careful study may give it specific\r\nrank. Locally, and now somewhat in the trade, it is known as the Sisson\r\nplum, after a Mr. Sisson, living near Mount Shasta, who has brought it to\r\nnotice. At present the Kelloggii seems to be the branch of promise for\r\nthe improvement of the wild plums of the western coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=15. PRUNUS UMBELLATA= Elliott\r\n\r\n    =1.= Elliott _Sk. Bot.

Inland it is found as far north as middle\r\nGeorgia,[131] Alabama and Mississippi and southern Arkansas. Though very\r\ncommon in localities in the region outlined, there are vast areas of\r\nthis territory in which it is scarcely found, preferring bottom lands of\r\nrivers and rich, moist soils in some instances and dry, sandy copses,\r\nopen woods and borders of fields in others. In flower and fruit it is a\r\nhandsome and conspicuous plant, yet, as the references show, the early\r\nbotanists did not describe it, and even Elliott, who gave it its name, in\r\n1821, passed it by with a scant description. Its neglect by the several\r\nfamous botanists of the Eighteenth Century who explored this region\r\nmust be attributed to their confusing it with _Prunus angustifolia_\r\nand _Prunus maritima_, one or the other of which is found in most of\r\nthe region, and to the idiosyncrasies of the distribution of _Prunus\r\numbellata_.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this species is unfit for dessert purposes but is commonly\r\ngathered for culinary use and sometimes is offered for sale in the\r\nmarkets of the South, being highly esteemed for pies, jams and jellies.\r\nThere appear to have been no efforts made to domesticate it, however, and\r\nsince it is quite inferior in fruit-characters to others of the native\r\nplums, efforts to that end are probably not worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS UMBELLATA INJUCUNDA= (Small) Sargent\r\n\r\n    =1.= Sargent _Sil.

Sargent, whom\r\nwe follow, gives it as a botanical variety of _Prunus umbellata_. Small\r\nsays that the two differ as follows: _Prunus injucunda_ has “a more rigid\r\nhabit and the foliage, including the branchlets, is velvety tomentose.\r\nIn place of the sub-globose drupe of _Prunus umbellata_ we find an\r\noblong fruit of an extremely bitter taste. The stone is correspondingly\r\nlengthened.” To these differences may be added tomentose or pubescent\r\nleaves, hairy umbels, and tomentose calyx and pistil, as characters\r\nnot found in _Prunus umbellata_ though there are occasional pubescent\r\nindividuals in the species.\r\n\r\nSmall first collected _Prunus injucunda_ in sandy soil in the granite\r\ndistricts about the base of Little Stone Mountain, Georgia, and reports\r\nit as occurring about Stone Mountain. Mohr reports the plant on rocky\r\nsummits and among the sandstone cliffs of Alpine Mountain, Talladego\r\nCounty, Alabama, as a low, unsightly shrub, four feet in height, with\r\nshort, straggling branches. The wild fruit is seldom fit for domestic use\r\nand with so much better material in other species the fruit-grower can\r\nhardly afford to spend time in an attempt to domesticate this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=16.= =PRUNUS MITIS= Beadle\r\n\r\n    =1.= Beadle _Bilt.

Sargent, to whom is due what field knowledge we have of the\r\nplant, gives its range from where found in Texas to western Louisiana\r\nand southern Arkansas. He says that it resembles and is often confounded\r\nwith _Prunus umbellata_ but may be distinguished from it by its bark,\r\nwhich differs from that of any other American plum tree, being more like\r\nthat of the chinquapin chestnut with which it grows; by the pubescence on\r\nthe leaves, not usually found on those of _Prunus umbellata_; and by its\r\nvariously colored fruit which ripens much later than that of other plums\r\nin the region. From what has been published in regard to the species\r\none gathers little in regard to its horticultural possibilities though\r\nthe statements that it bears great quantities of fruit and is used\r\nlocally for culinary purposes indicate that it may have some value under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=18.= =PRUNUS ANGUSTIFOLIA= Marshall\r\n\r\n    =1.= Marshall _Arb.

The inference is\r\nleft in most of the botanies that the species is not indigenous in the\r\nregion east of the Mississippi, but that it was brought by the aborigines\r\nfrom the southwestern section of the Mississippi Valley or possibly the\r\nsouthern Rocky Mountains or Mexico. The chief reason for the belief that\r\nit does not belong where it now grows is the fact that it is usually\r\nfound near human habitations and on the margins of fields and as it was\r\nknown to have been cultivated by the Indians,[133] it is supposed to have\r\nescaped from their semi-cultivated plantations. Bailey[134] dissents from\r\nthe current view, holding that the plant behaves like a true native in\r\nregions where he has known it, Maryland in particular. It seems to the\r\nwriter that Bartram’s supposition, given in the foot-note below, has been\r\nfollowed too closely. A careful study of recent botanical works indicates\r\nthat the species is indigenous to the southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nWhatever the original habitat may have been it is now found in the wild\r\nstate from southern Delaware to Florida and westward to the Panhandle of\r\nTexas and southern Oklahoma. It is usually found on rich soils but is\r\nfound as well in worn-out fields and pastures, most often in thickets\r\nof small trees or thorny shrubs or scraggly bushes, producing under the\r\nlatter conditions a small fruit so like cherries as to give it the name\r\nin some localities “Mountain Cherry” (Maryland), and in others “Wild\r\nCherry” (Louisiana).\r\n\r\nThere has been much confusion in regard to _Prunus angustifolia_. The\r\nolder botanists very generally mistook this species for Michaux’s\r\n_Prunus chicasa_ which, as stated in the foot-note on page 82, is almost\r\ncertainly not the plum under discussion. Practically all horticulturists\r\nascribe to _Prunus angustifolia_ a great number of cultivated varieties\r\nwhich cannot by any possibility belong here; indeed, it is doubtful if\r\nthe species is cultivated at all other than very locally, and still\r\nmore doubtful as to whether, as compared with other native plums,\r\nit is worth growing. In spite of this confusion the species is one\r\nof the most distinct of plums, and its characters are comparatively\r\nconstant throughout the range. A careful reading of Humphrey Marshall’s\r\ndescription of _Prunus angustifolia_ by subsequent botanists might have\r\nhelped to keep this plum in its place. Marshall wrote of it:\r\n\r\n“Prunus angustifolia. Chicasaw Plumb. This is scarcely of so large a\r\ngrowth as the former [_P. americana_], but rising with a stiff, shrubby\r\nstalk, dividing into many branches, which are garnished with smooth,\r\nlance-shaped leaves, much smaller and narrower than the first kind [_P.\r\namericana_], a little waved on their edges, marked with very fine,\r\nslight, coloured serratures, and of an equal shining green colour, on\r\nboth sides. The blossoms generally come out very thick and are succeeded\r\nby oval, or often somewhat egg-shaped fruit, with a very thin skin, and\r\nsoft, sweet pulp. There are varieties of this with yellow and crimson\r\ncoloured fruit. These being natives of the Southern states, are somewhat\r\nimpatient of much cold.”\r\n\r\nThe tree-characters given by Marshall are hardly those of the plum under\r\ncultivation which we have been calling _Prunus angustifolia_, and his\r\nstatement that the species is “impatient of much cold” at once separates\r\nthe cultivated “Angustifolias” from the true species. We shall contrast\r\nthe tree-characters of the two groups of plums in the discussion of\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_. Of the hardiness of the two it may be said that the\r\ncultivated varieties which we have placed in the last named species are\r\nfor the most part hardy as far north as Burlington, Vermont, while the\r\ntrue _Prunus angustifolia_ cannot be grown to fruiting as far north as\r\nGeneva, New York. Its behavior, too, on the northern limit of its range,\r\nand the fact that it did not follow the aborigines northward as it seems\r\nto have followed them from place to place within its range, show that\r\n_Prunus angustifolia_ belongs in the southern states.\r\n\r\nThis plum was well known by the early colonists of Virginia and\r\nsouthward. John Smith in Virginia, in 1607-9, and Strachey, writing\r\na few years later, saw “cherries much like a damoizm, but for their\r\ntaste and cullour we called them cherries.” Beverly in his _History of\r\nVirginia_, written in 1822, speaks of two sorts of plums, “the black and\r\nthe Murrey Plum, both of which are small and have much the same relish\r\nwith the Damasine”; the latter was probably the Angustifolia. Lawson in\r\nhis _History of Carolina_ speaks of several plums,[135] one of which,\r\nthe Indian plum, must have been the fruit of the present discussion.\r\nBruce[136] quotes a letter from William Fitzhugh, written in 1686, in\r\nwhich the latter speaks of the “Indian Cherry,” meaning of course, this\r\nplum; for it still passes under the same name.\r\n\r\nOf the horticultural possibilities of _Prunus angustifolia_, little\r\ncan be said from this Station as the trees cannot be grown here. But\r\nsince the species has been so long known, and is so near at hand to\r\nfruit-growers, without more of its offspring coming under cultivation,\r\nit is not likely that it may be counted upon to bring forth much in the\r\nfuture for the orchard. Such trees and fruits of this species as the\r\nwriter has seen are not at all promising for the cultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS ANGUSTIFOLIA WATSONI= (Sargent) Waugh[137]\r\n\r\n    =1.= Waugh _Vt.

It is usually found\r\nalong the banks of streams and rivers where it often forms shrubby\r\nthickets. The wild plums are held in high esteem for dessert and\r\nculinary purposes, becoming a commercial product in parts of the region\r\nin which they grow, and are occasionally transplanted to the garden or\r\norchard. From such transplantings a half dozen varieties have arisen.\r\nThe productiveness, hardiness to heat and cold and the size and quality\r\nof the fruits should attract plum-growers in the region of its habitat\r\nand experimenters elsewhere as well. Waugh[138] gives the following\r\ninteresting sketch of the use to which this plum has been put in Kansas:\r\n\r\n    “Early settlers in Kansas, before their own orchard plantings\r\n    came into bearing, used to find the sand plums well worth their\r\n    attention. In July and August everybody for fifty miles back\r\n    from the Arkansas sand hills used to flock thither to pick, and\r\n    it was an improvident or an unlucky family which came off with\r\n    less than four or five bushels to can for winter. Whole wagon\r\n    loads of fruit were often secured, and were sometimes offered\r\n    for sale in neighboring towns.\r\n\r\n    “The fruit gathered from the wild trees was of remarkably fine\r\n    quality, considering the conditions under which it grew. The\r\n    plums were quite uniformly large—I would say from memory that\r\n    they often reached three-fourths of an inch to an inch in\r\n    diameter. They were thin-skinned and of good flavor, not having\r\n    the unpleasant astringency of the wild Americana plums, which\r\n    were also sometimes gathered. They were excellent for canning\r\n    and made the finest of jelly.\r\n\r\n    “Naturally, the settlers who went every year to the sand hills\r\n    for plums brought back trees to plant in the gardens they were\r\n    opening. Almost every farm within the range mentioned above\r\n    had a few or many of the dwarf trees growing. Some of these\r\n    were fruitful and worth their room, but most of them have now\r\n    died out, or are neglected and forgotten. This is because\r\n    people have paid no attention to their selection, propagation\r\n    and cultivation. Further than this, however, the sand plum has\r\n    often failed signally to come up to its record when transferred\r\n    to cultivation. It seems not to adapt itself readily to a wide\r\n    diversity of soils and conditions.”\r\n\r\nThe sub-species is easily mistaken for the species; in herbarium\r\nspecimens it is almost impossible to distinguish between them, but in\r\ngeneral the Sand plum differs from Angustifolia in its dwarfer habit,\r\nshorter-jointed, zigzag, ashy-gray branches, smaller but thicker leaves,\r\nlarger, thicker skinned and better flavored fruit which ripens later, and\r\nin a smaller and somewhat differently marked stone. In distinguishing the\r\ntwo groups some allowance must be made for the adaptability of plums to\r\ndifferent environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PRUNUS ANGUSTIFOLIA VARIANS= Wight and Hedrick\r\n\r\n    Plant a small tree, attaining a height of twenty-five feet;\r\n    trunk small but well-defined; branches spreading, bushy,\r\n    sometimes armed with spinescent branchlets; young wood slender,\r\n    more or less zigzag, usually glabrous, glossy, reddish but\r\n    approaching a chestnut-brown; lenticels few, scattered,\r\n    yellowish, raised.\r\n\r\n    Leaves oblong, oval-lanceolate or rarely slightly\r\n    obovate-lanceolate, one and one-fifth to two and one-fifth\r\n    inches long, three-quarters to one inch broad, gradually\r\n    narrowed at the base, acute at the apex; margins very minutely\r\n    glandular-serrate; upper surface glabrous and somewhat\r\n    lustrous; lower surface paler, glabrous or sparingly hairy\r\n    along the midrib and in the axils of the lateral veins;\r\n    petioles slender, usually reddish, about one-half inch long,\r\n    pubescent along the upper side, eglandular or sometimes with\r\n    one or two glands at the apex; stipules small, linear and\r\n    glandular-dentate.\r\n\r\n    Flowers appearing from early in March and before the leaves\r\n    in the South, to the middle of April and with the leaves in\r\n    the North, in dried specimens about one-half inch broad;\r\n    pedicels three-eighths to one-half inch long, glabrous;\r\n    calyx campanulate, the tube glabrous; calyx-lobes usually\r\n    shorter than the tube, oblong and obtuse, glabrous on the\r\n    outer surface, glabrous or sometimes sparingly pubescent on\r\n    the inner, the margin ciliate, eglandular; petals obovate,\r\n    gradually narrowed toward the base, erose or entire toward the\r\n    apex.\r\n\r\n    Fruit globose or sub-globose, varying from red to yellow,\r\n    usually with a light bloom; stone about one-half inch long,\r\n    two-fifths inch broad, turgid, ovoid to elliptic-oblong,\r\n    obscurely pointed at the apex or sometimes slightly obtuse,\r\n    truncate or obliquely truncate at the base, grooved on the\r\n    dorsal edge, ventral edge with a narrow, thickened and slightly\r\n    grooved wing, the surfaces irregularly roughened.\r\n\r\nYellow Transparent may be considered a typical variety. Type specimens in\r\nthe Economic Collection of the Department of Agriculture were collected\r\nat the Eastern Shore Nurseries of J. W. Kerr, Denton, Maryland, (flowers)\r\nI. Tidestrom, April, 1910; (foliage and fruit) P. L. Ricker No. 2933,\r\nJune 29, 1909.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, _Prunus angustifolia varians_ forms dense thickets, the\r\nlarger specimens attaining a height of ten or twelve feet. When budded\r\nand grown in the orchard it assumes the form of a small tree with well\r\ndefined trunk and spreading branches, sometimes armed with rather slender\r\nspinescent branchlets. It is distinguished from the species by its\r\nusually more robust habit, by its having the young twigs less reddish\r\nand approaching a chestnut-brown in color, rather longer leaves, longer\r\npediceled flowers, and by the stone in most cases being more pointed\r\nat the apex. Usually in more fertile soil than the species, it occurs\r\nlocally from southern Oklahoma through eastern Texas southward possibly\r\nto the Colorado River, and probably westward to the Panhandle region. As\r\nyet, however, its distribution is not well defined.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the early ripening horticultural varieties previously\r\nreferred to _Prunus angustifolia_ belong to _Prunus angustifolia\r\nvarians_. The fruit of the sub-species appears to be superior to that of\r\nthe species though scarcely equal to that of the other southern plums now\r\ncultivated. Hybrids between this form and _Prunus munsoniana_ undoubtedly\r\noccur freely both in the wild state and under cultivation. The varieties\r\nEagle and El Paso have probably originated in this way. Nearly all of the\r\nplums belonging to this species, some twenty in all, are tender to cold,\r\nnone, so far as is known, succeeding in the North. African, Cluck, Jennie\r\nLucas and Yellow Transparent may be named as representative varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n=19.= =PRUNUS MUNSONIANA=[139] Wight and Hedrick\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PRUNUS MUNSONIANA_]\r\n\r\n    _Prunus angustifolia._ =1.= Bailey _Cornell Sta.

Type specimens, deposited in the Economic Collection\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, were collected by W.\r\nF. Wight (flowers) at the New York State Experiment Station, Geneva,\r\nNew York, No. 2721, May 15, 1909, and (foliage) at the Iowa Experiment\r\nStation, Ames, Iowa, No. 4178, September 15, 1909.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from _Prunus angustifolia_, with which it has long\r\nbeen confused, chiefly in being a much larger plant, a true tree while\r\nthe other seldom reaches the size of a tree. It has coarser and less\r\ntwiggy branches, shaggier bark and less red in the color of the young\r\nwood. The leaves are larger, thicker, more truly lanceolate in shape,\r\nless folded, a lighter green and less glossy. The flowers of the new\r\nspecies are larger, fewer in number, borne in less dense umbels which\r\nare not so nearly sessile as those of the older species and are borne on\r\nlonger pedicels. The calyx-lobes are erect in this species and reflexed\r\nin _Prunus angustifolia_, strongly marked by marginal glands in _Prunus\r\nmunsoniana_ and eglandular in _Prunus angustifolia_. The fruits are\r\nlarger and wholly plum-like in the newly made species and cherry-like in\r\n_Prunus angustifolia_. The stone is very plum-like in _Prunus munsoniana_\r\nbut in the older species it might easily be mistaken for the pit of a\r\ncherry. The robust form is hardy as far north as Geneva, New York, at\r\nleast, while the other species cannot be grown much north of Mason and\r\nDixon’s line.\r\n\r\nOf the varieties which certainly belong to this species by far the\r\ngreatest number have originated under cultivation. There is herbarium\r\nmaterial from uncultivated plants to show that this species is rather\r\ncommon in the northern part of Texas, in eastern Oklahoma and in parts\r\nof Missouri. It is a species forming dense thickets in its native\r\nhabitat, where it is usually found in rather rich soils, with the older\r\ncentral specimens sometimes attaining a height of twenty to twenty-five\r\nfeet and gradually diminishing in height to the edge of the thicket.\r\nWhen budded and grown in the orchard it forms a well-defined trunk and\r\nattains a height of twenty-five feet or more. The branches are little or\r\nnot at all spinescent, bark of the stem in young specimens reddish or\r\nchestnut-brown, and usually rather smooth, becoming scaly and losing its\r\nreddish color with age, that of the young twigs usually chestnut-brown.\r\nIts natural range, though not yet definitely determined, probably extends\r\nfrom central Tennessee through northern Mississippi, northern Arkansas,\r\ncentral Missouri and southeastern Kansas to the valley of the Little\r\nWichita River in northern Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Goose varieties, now placed here, in the past have been\r\nconsidered hybrids more closely resembling _Prunus hortulana_ than any\r\nother species. But Wild Goose and some other varieties of its group are\r\nnot to be distinguished from _Prunus munsoniana_ and beyond question\r\nbelong in this species. The varieties in this division of Munsoniana\r\nare largely seedlings of Wild Goose, each variety possibly with a\r\ndifferent male parent since Wild Goose seldom or never fruits unless\r\ncross-fertilized. Thus, of these plums, twelve are known seedlings of\r\nWild Goose; seven others originated under cultivation; the origin of\r\nfourteen is not known and it is not certain that any beside Wild Goose\r\ncame from wild plants. From such a record, and from the characters of\r\nthe plants, it is probable that some of the Wild Goose varieties are\r\nhorticultural hybrids, many of them from H. A. Terry of Iowa in whose\r\nwork, with many varieties of several species, hybridity was the rule.\r\n\r\nHorticulturally, this is the most important group of native plums for\r\nthe South; it contains a greater number of cultivated varieties than\r\nany other native species excepting _Prunus americana_, no less than\r\nsixty sorts being listed in _The Plums of New York_, some of which\r\nare deservedly the best known of the native plums for either home or\r\nmarket use. For dessert or the kitchen they are particularly valuable,\r\nhaving a sprightly vinous flavor making them very pleasant flavored to\r\neat out of hand or when cooked. Their bright colors, semi-transparent\r\nskins and well-turned forms make them very attractive in appearance.\r\nConsidering the juiciness of most of the varieties, these plums ship and\r\nkeep well. Unfortunately nearly all of the varieties of this species\r\nare clingstones. This group hybridizes more freely than any other of\r\nthe plums and there are a great number of promising hybrids of which\r\nit is one of the parents. Of all plums, these are most in need of\r\ncross-pollination, some of the varieties being nearly or, as in the case\r\nof Wild Goose, wholly self-sterile. While these plums are especially\r\nvaluable in the Southern States, some of them are desirable in the North\r\nas well, where all will grow at least as far north as central New York.\r\nPlums of this species are occasionally but not often used as stocks. Some\r\nrecommend them for stocks for low or wet lands. The fact that _Prunus\r\nmunsoniana_ suckers very badly will probably preclude its use largely in\r\npropagating.\r\n\r\nThe leading varieties under cultivation of this species are Arkansas,\r\nPottawattamie, Robinson, Newman, Wild Goose and Downing, all of which are\r\ndescribed in full and illustrated in colors in _The Plums of New York_.\r\nThe first four of these have in the past been referred by botanists\r\nand pomologists to _Prunus angustifolia_ and the last two to _Prunus\r\nhortulana_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=20.= =PRUNUS MARITIMA= Marshall\r\n\r\n    =1.= Marshall _Arbust.

It is destined, however, in the\r\nminds of not a few, because of qualities which we shall describe, to play\r\na more important part in the future of the cultivated plum flora than it\r\nhas in the past. It has several valuable characters that should fit it\r\nalike for direct cultivation and for hybridizing with other species. It\r\nis surprising that more has not been done to domesticate the Maritima\r\nplums for they were among the first fruits noticed by early explorers\r\nand have always been used by both Indians and Whites for culinary\r\npurposes. The fact that Domestica plums thrive in their habitat is the\r\nonly explanation of the non-amelioration of this plum before this.\r\n\r\nSeptember third, 1609, Hudson entered the river bearing his name and\r\nfound “a very good harbor, abundance of blue plums, some currants brought\r\nby the natives dried and the country full of great and tall oaks.” The\r\nblue plum was the Maritima; and from Hudson’s time nearly all of the\r\naccounts of the New World given by early explorers mention this plum. It\r\nis probably one of the plums described by Captain John Smith as a cherry\r\n“much like a Damson;” by Edward Winslow in 1621, in a letter to England\r\nto a friend, as one of his “plums of three sorts”; by Francis Higginson\r\nin his _New England’s Plantation_ in 1630; described by Thomas Morton in\r\n1632 in his _New English Canaan_ as having “fruit as bigg as our ordinary\r\nbullis.” John Lawson, one of the first of American naturalists, describes\r\nthem rather more fully as follows:[140] “The American Damsons are both\r\nblack and white, and about the Bigness of an European Damson. They grow\r\nany where if planted from the Stone or Slip; bear a white blossom, and\r\nare a good fruit. They are found on the Sand-Banks all along the Coast\r\nof America. I have planted several in my Orchard, that came from the\r\nStone, which thrive well amongst the rest of my Trees. But they never\r\ngrow to the Bigness of the other Trees now spoken of. These are plentiful\r\nBearers.” These are but a few of the many references to the Beach plum\r\nbut they are enough to show that the colonists were attracted by this\r\nwild plum found on a long stretch of the Atlantic seaboard—probably the\r\nfirst fruit to attract attention from Virginia to New England.\r\n\r\nTo be more explicit as to its range, _Prunus maritima_, in its typical\r\nform, is an inhabitant of the sea beaches and sand dunes from New\r\nBrunswick to the Carolinas, or possibly farther south, growing inland\r\nusually as far as recent ocean soil formations extend. As it leaves the\r\nseaboard marked variations make their appearance, chief of which are,\r\nsmaller, more oval, smoother and thinner leaves and smaller fruit. The\r\nspecies has been reported as an inhabitant of the sands at the head of\r\nLake Michigan,[141] but the writer, who is well acquainted with this\r\nregion, has never seen it there, nor is it to be found in the chief\r\nherbaria of Michigan as having been collected in the state.\r\n\r\nIn the region where it is found wild the Maritima plum is a rather common\r\narticle of trade. The fruit is usually sold by the quart, the price being\r\nfive or ten cents, and is used for both dessert and culinary purposes\r\nthough for most part for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe species is one of the most variable of the true plums and there\r\nis, probably must ever be, much disagreement as to its botanical\r\nrelationships. Several botanical varieties of _Prunus maritima_ have\r\nalready been named and there are yet groups within the species which\r\nseem to be nearly as distinct as those described and possibly worth\r\ndistinguishing. Since the variations show in the size, color and edible\r\nqualities of the fruit, as well as in the characters of the plant, it\r\nis to be expected that the species has a horticultural future though\r\nat present it has but one cultivated variety—Bassett. Professor J. W.\r\nMacfarlane of the University of Pennsylvania has shown well the great\r\nrange of variations in this plum both from botanical and horticultural\r\naspects.[142] He holds that these variations are sufficiently distinct\r\nto make many varieties of this plum in the wild, to which DeVries agrees\r\nwith the statement that they indicate “the existence of separate races as\r\nelementary species.”[143] The plum which Small has described as _Prunus\r\ngravesii_, to be discussed later, is a marked variation of _Prunus\r\nmaritima_.\r\n\r\nAs it grows on the sea-coast _Prunus maritima_ is a low bush three to six\r\nfeet high, occasionally reaching a height of ten or twelve feet. Usually\r\nthe plant is straggling but sometimes it is compact or even tree-like.\r\nInland, on better soils, or under cultivation it makes a rather\r\nhandsome dwarf tree. The flowers are borne in great numbers, completely\r\ncovering the plant and coming later than most of the plums bloom. The\r\nspecies bears fruit very abundantly, which is always attractive but of\r\nquite diverse value for food. The fruit varies in size from a half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in diameter and is almost spherical, though\r\nsometimes oval and with or without a distinct suture. The usual color is\r\na rich bluish-black with a waxy bloom, but red, yellow, amber and orange\r\nfruits are often found. In taste the Maritima plums range from inedible\r\nto nearly as rich a flavor as is found in the best of the Domestica\r\nplums. Besides variations in the above and other qualities, Macfarlane\r\ncalls attention to the range in ripening of the fruit of this plum,\r\nshowing that it extends over a period of two months, an exceptionally\r\nwide variation for a wild plant.\r\n\r\nThis plum has a number of qualities that commend it to the fruit-grower.\r\nSince in the wild it grows on sandy soils it is not likely under\r\ncultivation to make great demands on either the moisture or the fertility\r\nof soils. It is very hardy and very productive and seldom fails to bear.\r\nIt seems to be free or nearly so from some of the pests of cultivated\r\nplums. Lastly, the great number of wild varieties of the plums give many\r\nstarting points from which to breed cultivated varieties. Two objections\r\nto the wild fruits are that when the fruit is harvested the juice often\r\nexudes from the wound made by the parting from the stem, and secondly,\r\nthe secretion of some substance forming a dark colored, hard core in\r\nthe pulp which gives a very bitter taste to the fruit. The last defect\r\nis very common in the wild plums and is probably due to the sting of an\r\ninsect. Under cultivation it may be possible to obtain fruits free from\r\nthese faults.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable if some of the characters enumerated above could be\r\ncombined with those of other species. Burbank has hybridized the Maritima\r\nplum with other species, with promising results. Of these he writes under\r\ndate of December 6, 1909, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I first began raising _Prunus maritima_ about 1887—twenty-two\r\n    years ago—collecting myself and having specimens sent me\r\n    all the way from the coast of Labrador to South Carolina,\r\n    the finest of which were obtained from the eastern coast of\r\n    Massachusetts. Among the seedlings, of which I raised and\r\n    fruited several hundred thousands, were yellow, red, purple\r\n    and almost black ones, early and late, round, oval, oblate and\r\n    flattened, with big stones and little stones, free stone and\r\n    cling stone, and much variety in productiveness and growth\r\n    of the young bushes, but _not one of them_ the first two or\r\n    three generations were very much increased in size—probably\r\n    the largest being about the size of a cranberry or a small\r\n    hazelnut—and none of them of very exceptional quality, though\r\n    their habit of blooming late was a tremendous advantage, as\r\n    they invariably escaped our spring frosts. This, with their\r\n    unusual hardiness induced me to continue experimenting with\r\n    them. Finally after some ten years I obtained a very delicious\r\n    variety, about an inch in length and three-quarters of an\r\n    inch in diameter, tree much increased in size, larger foliage\r\n    and more productive and producing enormous quantities of most\r\n    delicious fruit. From this I raised a great many thousand,\r\n    almost as good and a few of them even _better_, several\r\n    hundred of which have been selected and are now bearing on my\r\n    Sebastopol place. Some of these improved seedling trees grow\r\n    five to ten times as large as the ordinary Maritima, with\r\n    larger leaves and in every possible way improved. My greatest\r\n    success with this species (and one of the most striking\r\n    occurrences in my work with plums) was produced by pollinating\r\n    one of the somewhat improved Maritimas with _Prunus triflora_.\r\n\r\n    “The very first generation, a plum was produced which is an\r\n    astonishing grower for a Maritima—almost equal to the Triflora,\r\n    with large, broad glossy foliage of almost the exact shape of\r\n    the Maritima, Maritima blossoms, and fruit weighing nearly\r\n    one-quarter of a pound each, with an improved superior Maritima\r\n    flavor, Maritima pit in form, but enlarged. The most singular\r\n    peculiarity of this plum, which is so enormous, is that the\r\n    trees commence to bloom about with the Triflora and bloom and\r\n    bear fruit all summer, so that blossoms, young fruit and the\r\n    enormous deep red ripening fruit can be seen on the trees at\r\n    the same time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=21.= =PRUNUS GRAVESII= Small\r\n\r\n    =1.= Small _Torrey Bot.

It grows in the\r\nneighborhood of _Prunus maritima_ to which it is evidently closely\r\nrelated. Small in describing the species gives the following differences\r\nbetween the Gravesii and the Maritima plums: (1) _Prunus gravesii_ is\r\nmore slender and delicate in habit, and matures its leaves and fruit\r\nearlier in the season. (2) The leaf of _Prunus gravesii_ is small and\r\nsub-orbicular while that of the other is larger and more elongated. (3)\r\nThe new species has smaller flowers with sub-orbicular petals while those\r\nof _Prunus maritima_ are broadly obovate and gradually narrowed at the\r\nbase. (4) The fruit of _Prunus gravesii_ is smaller and more globose and\r\nhas shorter pedicels. (5) The stone is more turgid and is pointed only\r\nat the base; that of _Prunus maritima_ is usually pointed at both ends.\r\n(6) Sprouts arising from the ground do not produce flowers as they\r\nfrequently do in the case of _Prunus maritima_.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this plum has not been attempted and as compared with\r\nMaritima it promises little for the fruit-grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n=22.= =PRUNUS ORTHOSEPALA= Koehne\r\n\r\n    =1.= Koehne _Deut.

A name, however, was not proposed for it, and in 1888, probably,\r\nplants or seeds were sent to Herr Spath, of the Rixdorf Nurseries, near\r\nBerlin, where this plum was found in flower by Dr. Emil Koehne, who has\r\ndescribed it under the name of _Prunus orthosepala_.”\r\n\r\nOf the affinity of this species Sargent says: “_Prunus orthosepala_ is a\r\ntrue plum, rather closely related to _Prunus hortulana_, from which it\r\ncan be distinguished by the smaller number of glands of the petioles,\r\nby the eglandular calyx-lobes, the dark colored fruit and smoother\r\nstone.” As the writer has seen this plum growing in the Arnold Arboretum,\r\nJamaica Plains, Massachusetts, and the City parks at Rochester, New\r\nYork, it seems well worth cultivating. Mr. J. W. Kerr writes of it as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “I have _P. orthosepala_ fruiting here, and with me\r\n    its fruit is exceptionally fine in quality, sparingly\r\n    produced—attributable I believe to the fact that no variety\r\n    stands near enough to it for proper inter-pollination. The\r\n    trees are rather dwarfish in habit, close-headed, with fine\r\n    clean foliage. The fruit is globular in form; size equal to\r\n    fair specimens of Hawkeye or Wyant; skin a greenish-yellow,\r\n    almost entirely covered with deep red.”\r\n\r\nW. F. Wight of the United States Department of Agriculture has collected\r\nspecimens of a cultivated plum, taken from the wild, locally known as the\r\nLaire, in Rooks and neighboring counties in Kansas, with foliage very\r\nsimilar to _Prunus orthosepela_. While the identity of Laire with the\r\nspecies under discussion cannot be established at this time, the reported\r\nsource of the seeds, “southern Texas,” from which _Prunus orthosepela_\r\nwas grown may be an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n=23.= =PRUNUS GRACILIS= Engelmann and Gray\r\n\r\n    =1.= Engelmann and Gray _Bost.

It grows most abundantly and thrives\r\nbest in Oklahoma, a fact which leads Waugh to call it the “Oklahoma”\r\nplum. All who know the species agree that it is a near approach to\r\nMaritima in many of its characters. This plum is very variable and\r\nsome of its forms seem not to have been well studied. As a fruit plant\r\nGracilis is hardly known in cultivation though Torrey says it is\r\ncultivated in the region of its habitat under the name Prairie Cherry.\r\nThe wild fruit is used more or less locally and is sometimes offered\r\nfor sale in the markets of western towns. The quality is about the same\r\nas that of the wild Americanas and under cultivation would probably\r\nimprove. The small size of plant and fruit are the most unpromising\r\ncharacters though the species is also much subject to black-knot.\r\n\r\n\r\n=24.= =PRUNUS RIVULARIS= Scheele\r\n\r\n    =1.= Scheele _Linnaea_ =21=:594. 1848. =2.= Gray _Pl.

The\r\nspecies is included here largely upon the authority of Professor C. S.\r\nSargent of the Arnold Arboretum and W. F. Wight, who know the plant as\r\ndescribed by Scheele in the field. Gray described the plant as “verging\r\nto Americana.” Bailey says “it evidently bears the same relation to\r\n_Prunus americana_ that _Prunus watsoni_ does to the Chickasaw plum.”\r\nWaugh is “convinced that _Prunus rivularis_ Scheele is nothing more than\r\none of the more distinct sub-divisions of the multiform _hortulana_\r\ngroup.”[144] T. V. Munson writes me that the Waylandi plums belong in\r\nthis species. My own opinion is, from the herbarium specimens examined,\r\nfrom correspondence and conversation with those who have seen the plant\r\nin the field, that Scheele’s species is a good one and quite distinct\r\nfrom the species named by Bailey, Waugh and Munson as allied to it. It is\r\nto be looked for along the streams and bottom-lands in the neighborhood\r\nof San Antonio and New Braunfels, Texas. The plum is locally known as\r\nthe Creek plum and in common with other plums is gathered for home\r\nconsumption. The species seems to offer but few possibilities for the\r\nfruit-grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPLUM CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen states produced over 82 per ct. of the plum crop of the United States\r\nin 1899. The census of 1900 shows that in the preceding year the total\r\ncrop in the country was 8,764,032 bushels of which California, Oregon,\r\nNew York, Washington, Michigan, Iowa, Texas, Arkansas, Ohio and Kansas,\r\nnamed in order of yield, produced 7,429,248 bushels. All other states\r\nyielded 1,334,784 bushels. Of these ten states, three, California, Oregon\r\nand Washington, holding first, second and fourth places in production,\r\nuse by far the greater parts of their crops for prunes. Four others,\r\nIowa, Texas, Arkansas and Kansas, grow the native and Triflora varieties\r\nalmost exclusively. New York with a crop of 313,668 bushels in 1899,\r\nMichigan with 213,682 bushels the same year and Ohio with 81,435 bushels,\r\ngrew the main crop of Domesticas for the states in which plums are not\r\nmade into prunes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Nineteenth Century the plum ranked third in commercial\r\nvalue among orchard products, being surpassed by the apple and the\r\npeach. The increase in number of trees and bushels of fruit for the\r\nwhole country for the decade ending with 1899 was remarkable, being for\r\ntrees 334.9 per ct. and for bushels of fruit 243.1 per ct. These great\r\nincreases were due to very large planting of plums for prunes on the\r\nPacific Coast and to the widespread distribution during these ten years\r\nof native and Triflora varieties. It is very doubtful if the percentage\r\nof increase has been nearly so great during the present decade. It is\r\nlikely that the development of rapid transportation and refrigerator\r\nservice between the great plum-growing region of the far West and the\r\nmarkets of the East has caused a decrease in trees and production in the\r\neastern states.\r\n\r\nPlum-growing, as with the growing of all fruits, is confined to\r\nlocalities geologically, climatically and commercially adapted to the\r\nindustry. If we take New York as an example we find that plums are grown\r\nlargely only in ten of the sixty-one counties, according to the census\r\nof 1900. These with the number of trees in each are as follows: Niagara\r\n184,133, Ontario 92,917, Seneca 59,205, Monroe 57,246, Schuyler 48,336,\r\nOrleans 41,985, Yates 32,742, Albany 32,373, Erie 30,281, Wayne 30,047.\r\nOver 62 per ct. of all the trees in the State are in these counties and\r\nprobably they produce more than 90 per ct. of the plums sent to market.\r\n\r\nA canvass of the acreage of four hundred plum-growers in New York shows\r\nthat the following in order named are the leading commercial varieties:\r\nBradshaw, including Niagara, which is identical, Reine Claude including\r\nits several near variations, Italian Prune, German Prune, Lombard,\r\nShropshire, Grand Duke, Washington and Gueii. Abundance and Burbank\r\nare as widely distributed as any of these, chiefly owing to the zeal\r\nwith which nurserymen have sold these varieties, but are seldom grown\r\nexclusively in commercial plantations, and their popularity is now\r\non the wane as is also the case with Red June which has been largely\r\nplanted. Varieties of native plums are hardly grown in New York though\r\nnow and then they are found in home collections and there are a few small\r\ncommercial plantations of them.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the native and Triflora plums is so inferior to that of the\r\nDomestica sorts for market and domestic purposes, that varieties of these\r\nare not likely to take the place of the Domestica plums. Producers and\r\npurchasers are now familiar with the possibilities of the natives and of\r\nthe Orientals and have not been greatly attracted by them in New York. It\r\nis true, however, that the natives have been chiefly represented by Wild\r\nGoose and the Trifloras by Abundance and Burbank—scarcely the best that\r\nthese groups of plums can produce. It is true, too, that the varieties\r\nhave been greatly over-praised and that they now suffer from the\r\nreaction. Yet the Domesticas command the market and their reliableness\r\nin the orchard gives them a popularity in this region which other plums\r\ncannot for a long while trench upon.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a discussion of the conditions under which plums are\r\nnow grown in North America and more particularly in New York. Of these,\r\nclimate, with this fruit, should be first discussed, outranking all\r\nothers in importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\nClimatic conditions determine the culture of the plum not only for a\r\nregion but for a locality; not only as to whether it is possible to grow\r\nplums at all but as to whether this fruit can be grown with reasonable\r\nprospects of commercial success in competition with other localities.\r\nThe constituents of climate which are important in plum-growing are\r\ntemperature, rainfall and air currents, the last two being largely\r\ndependent upon the first. The relationship existing between plums and\r\nthese factors of climate are fairly well known for they have received\r\nattention from the very beginning of plum culture.\r\n\r\nThere are four phases of temperature that need to be considered in\r\norder to get a clear insight into the climatic conditions which govern\r\nproduction of fruit crops. These are, the daily, monthly and annual\r\nchanges in temperature and the extremes in temperature. Of these the\r\ndaily and annual changes are of little importance. All plants are very\r\nadaptable to daily variations in climate and are little affected by them.\r\nAnnual variations are shown by statements of the annual mean temperatures\r\nbut such statements are of small value to fruit-growers as they may be\r\nthe result of averaging very divergent temperatures or temperatures very\r\nclose together. The monthly mean, however, is a very fair criterion of\r\nclimate for fruit-growing, especially when given with the amount and\r\ndistribution of rainfall.\r\n\r\nBut far more important than any of the above phases are the extremes\r\nin temperature and more particularly of cold. A plant can not be grown\r\nprofitably where the temperature, even occasionally, falls below the\r\npoint where winter-killing results to tree or bud, or where the blossom\r\nis injured by frost. Extremes of heat are disastrous usually only when\r\nlong continued. For each fruit, too, there must be a total amount of heat\r\navailable to carry it from the setting of the fruit to maturity, in which\r\nrespect varieties of any fruit may differ materially. Of the injurious\r\neffects and of the necessary amounts of heat, however, we know but little.\r\n\r\nThese general considerations of temperature lead us to their application\r\nto the plum and especially to a discussion of the most important of the\r\nseveral factors—hardiness.\r\n\r\nHardiness to cold, a matter of prime importance with all fruits, is\r\nespecially so with the plum because of the many different species, each\r\nwith its own capacity for withstanding cold. As the different species\r\nare taken from their natural habitat to other regions, there to become\r\nacclimatized, and as new forms originate by hybridization, the matter\r\nbecomes more complicated and more important. Waugh[145] has investigated\r\nthe hardiness of plums and we publish a table given by him showing the\r\nhardiness of representative varieties of the species most generally\r\ncultivated. We have taken the liberty of adding a few plums not given in\r\nthe original table and have also made some changes in the nomenclature of\r\nthe groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE HARDINESS OF REPRESENTATIVE VARIETIES OF PLUMS AT\r\nVARIOUS PLACES.\r\n\r\n  h—hardy; hh—half-hardy; t—tender.\r\n\r\n  ==================+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   | W.|   |   |   |   |   |\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | W |   | M\r\n                    |   |   | I |   | C | N | N |   |   |   | i |   | i\r\n                    |   | I | l |   | o | e | e | V | O |   | s |   | n\r\n                    |   | n | l | K | l | b | w | e | n |   | c |   | n\r\n                    |   | d | i | a | o | r |   | r | t | M | o |   | e\r\n                    | O | i | n | n | r | a | Y | m | a | a | n | I | s\r\n                    | h | a | o | s | a | s | o | o | r | i | s | o | o\r\n                    | i | n | i | a | d | k | r | n | i | n | i | w | t\r\n                    | o | a | s | s | o | a | k | t | o | e | n | a | a\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---\r\n  Americana Plums:  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     De Soto        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h\r\n     Hawkeye        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h\r\n     Wolf           | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Domestica Plums:  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     Lombard        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh\r\n     Reine Claude   | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh | h |hh | h | t\r\n     Bradshaw       | h | h | t |hh | h | h | h |hh |hh |hh |hh |hh | t\r\n     Arctic         | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Hortulana Plums:  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     Moreman        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | ? | h |hh | t\r\n     Golden Beauty  | ? | h | h | h | h | ? | h |h? | ? | ? |hh | h | t\r\n     Wayland        | h | h | h | h | h | ? | h | h | ? | ? |hh |hh | t\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Insititia Plums:  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     Damsons        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Munsoniana Plums: |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     Pottawattamie  | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh | t | h | h | h\r\n     Newman         | h | h | h | h | ? | ? | h | ? | t | t |hh | t | t\r\n     Robinson       | h | h | h | h | ? | ? | h | ? | t | t | t |hh | t\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Nigra Plums       | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  The Simon Plum    | h | h | h | h |hh |hh | h |hh |hh | t | t | t | t\r\n                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  Triflora Plums:   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n     Abundance      | h | h | h | h |hh | h | h | h | h |hh |hh |hh | t\r\n     Burbank        | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h | h |hh |hh |hh | t\r\n     Satsuma        |hh | h | h |hh | t | h |hh |hh |hh | t | t |hh | t\r\n     Kelsey         | t | ? | t |hh | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t\r\n  ==================+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===\r\n\r\nA few general statements in addition to the above table will help\r\nto make plain the comparative hardiness of the different groups of\r\ncultivated plums. The Nigras may be rated as the hardiest of the plums\r\nto be considered though the Americanas are but slightly less hardy.\r\nThe plums of these species are the hardiest of our tree-fruits and are\r\nable to resist nearly as much cold as any other cultivated plant. The\r\nInsititias, as represented by the Damsons, at least, come next hardiest\r\nafter the above species, with varieties of Domestica, as Arctic, Lombard\r\nand Voronesh, nearly as hardy. So far as resistance to cold is concerned\r\nthe Domestica plums as a class are less hardy than the apple, ranking in\r\nthis respect with the pear. Of the Domesticas the Reine Claude plums are\r\nas tender to cold as any though some consider Bradshaw as more tender.\r\nBetween these last sorts and the hardiest varieties there is a great\r\nrange in capacity to endure cold, as would be expected with so large\r\na number of varieties originating in widely separated climates. The\r\nTriflora plums vary more in hardiness than any other of the cultivated\r\nspecies. Speaking very generally they are less hardy than the Domesticas,\r\nthe hardiest sorts, Burbank and Abundance, being somewhat hardier than\r\nthe peach, while the tenderest varieties, of which Kelsey is probably\r\nmost tender, are distinctly less hardy than the peach. Of the remaining\r\nplums, the Hortulana, Munsoniana and Watsoni groups, there are great\r\ndiversities in opinion as to hardiness. Probably all of the varieties in\r\nthese last groups are as hardy as the peach with a few sorts in each more\r\nhardy than the peach. It is to be expected from the more northern range\r\nof the wild prototypes that the Hortulana and Watsoni plums are somewhat\r\nhardier than _Prunus munsoniana_.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall is of comparatively small concern to plum-growers in\r\nAmerica, since, with now and then an exception, in eastern America it\r\nis sufficient under proper cultivation, and on the Pacific Coast the\r\ncrop is largely grown under irrigation. Summarized statements of annual\r\nrainfall are of little or no importance since almost all depends upon the\r\ndistribution of the amount throughout the year and upon the manner in\r\nwhich it falls. Monthly and seasonal “means” of precipitation, as in the\r\ncase of temperature, may be of considerable importance in determining the\r\ndesirability of a locality for plums.\r\n\r\nAir currents are of local or regional occurrence and though not often the\r\ndeterminant of profitable culture of plums have sometimes been important\r\nfactors in choosing a location to grow this fruit. The occurrence,\r\ndirection, moisture condition and temperature are the attributes of air\r\ncurrents usually considered. The failure of many plums to grow in the\r\nprairie region of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains is no doubt\r\ndue in some measure to winter winds. The problem of varietal adaptation\r\nis more or less complicated in any region by the nature of the air\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nAn extremity of any of the constituents of what we call “weather”\r\nendangers the plum crop at blossoming time. In New York stresses of\r\nweather are probably the predominating causes of the non-setting of fruit\r\non plum trees which bear an abundance of blossoms. This is well shown in\r\na study of the relations of weather to the setting of fruit made by the\r\nNew York Agricultural Experiment Station in which it is held that several\r\nphases of weather at blossoming time cause the loss of plum crops.[146]\r\nThus late frosts, wet weather, low temperature, strong winds and wide\r\ndaily ranges in temperature were factors in the loss of fruit crops\r\nin all of the failures during a period of twenty-five years. Quite as\r\nsignificant was the fact that in all of the years during this period when\r\nthere was sunshine and warm, dry weather during blossoming time there\r\nwere good crops of fruit.\r\n\r\nLocations for growing the different varieties of plums are selected with\r\nreference to general and local climate. As regards general climate,\r\nlatitude, altitude and proximity to large bodies of water are the chief\r\ndetermining characters; as regards local climate, the lay of the land\r\nhas most to do as a determinant. Again, varieties are selected with\r\nreference to time of blooming, that they may escape in some degree\r\ninjurious climatal agencies. Lastly, varieties are selected having\r\ngreater capacity, from one cause or another, to withstand injurious\r\nweather. With all varieties it is found that cultural treatment to induce\r\nstrong vitality helps a tree to withstand stresses of harmful weather at\r\nblossoming time.\r\n\r\nThe above considerations show that the blossoming dates of plums should\r\nbe known for the proper culture of this fruit. In the following table\r\naverages of the blooming dates of varieties of plums for the eight years\r\njust past, 1902 to 1909, inclusive, are given.\r\n\r\nIn making use of these dates, consideration must be given to the\r\nenvironment of the orchards at Geneva. The latitude of the Smith\r\nAstronomical Observatory, a quarter of a mile from the Station orchards\r\nis 42° 52′ 46.2″; the altitude of the orchards is from five hundred to\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five feet above the sea level; the soil is a\r\nstiff and rather cold clay; the orchards lie about a mile west of Seneca\r\nLake, a body of water forty miles in length and from one to three and\r\none-half miles in width and more than six hundred feet deep. The lake has\r\nfrozen over but a few times since the region was settled, over a hundred\r\nyears ago, and has a very beneficial influence on the adjacent country in\r\nlessening the cold of winter and the heat of summer, and in preventing\r\nearly blooming.\r\n\r\nThe dates are those of full bloom. They were taken from trees grown under\r\nnormal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and as to all other\r\nfactors which might influence the blooming period.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the table shows that there is a variation of several\r\ndays between the time of full bloom of the different varieties of the\r\nsame species. These differences can be taken advantage of in selecting\r\nsorts to avoid injury from frost. The same table shows the ripening\r\nseason of the plums growing on the Station grounds. Now and then the late\r\nand very late plums given in the table may be caught by fall frosts in\r\nthe colder parts of New York or in regions having a similar climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING BLOOMING DATES AND SEASON OF RIPENING.\r\n\r\nThe “blooming date” is that of full bloom.\r\n\r\nUnder season of ripening “very early” is from July 15 to August 10;\r\n“early,” August 10 to August 20; “mid-season,” August 20 to September\r\n10; “late,” September 10 to September 20; “very late,” September 20 to\r\nOctober 1.\r\n\r\n  ================+=========================+============================\r\n                  |      Blooming date      |     Season of ripening\r\n  ----------------+-------------------------+-----+-----+------+----+----\r\n                  |           May           |     |     |      |    |\r\n                  |-------------------------|Very |Early| Mid- |Late|Very\r\n                  |1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2|early|     |season|    |late\r\n                  |2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4|     |     |      |    |\r\n  ----------------+-------------------------+-----+-----+------+----+----\r\n                  |                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n  _P. americana_: |                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n    De Soto       |            *            |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Hawkeye       |          *              |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    New Ulm       |        *                |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Ocheeda       |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Oren          |            *            |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Rollingstone  |            *            |     |     |      |    |\r\n    Stoddard      |          *              |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Surprise      |        *                |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Wolf          |            *            |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Wood          |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Wyant         |              *          |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n                  |                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n  _P. cerasifera_:|                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n    De Caradeuc   |*                        |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n    Golden Cherry |*                        |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n                  |                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n  _P. domestica_: |                         |     |     |      |    |\r\n    Agen          |    *                    |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Altham        |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    American      |    *                    |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Arch Duke     |          *              |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Autumn Compote|    *                    |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Arctic        |        *                |     |     |      |    |\r\n    Bavay         |    *                    |     |     |      |    |  *\r\n    Béjonnièrs    |              *          |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Belgian Purple|  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Belle         |                *        |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Bradshaw      |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Bryanston     |*                        |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Chambourcy    |        *                |     |     |      |    |  *\r\n    Champion      |      *                  |     |  *  |      |    |\r\n    Cling Stem    |      *                  |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Clyman        |  *                      |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n    Czar          |    *                    |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n    Dawson        |              *          |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n    Diamond       |  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Doretts       |    *                    |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Duane         |  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Early Rivers  |  *                      |     |  *  |      |    |\r\n    Early Orleans |                         |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Early Royal   |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Early Tours   |          *              |  *  |     |      |    |\r\n    Empire        |  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Englebert     |    *                    |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Esjum Erik    |        *                |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Field         |  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Freeman       |  *                      |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    Furst         |                  *      |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    German Prune  |          *              |     |     |      |  * |\r\n    Giant         |      *                  |     |     |   *  |    |\r\n    G.

setting of the fruit in some varieties even though the trees\r\nbear an abundance of blossoms. Blooming, the prelude of fruiting, had\r\nlittle significance to the fruit-grower until the discovery was made that\r\nmany varieties of several fruits were unable to fertilize themselves and\r\nthat failures of fruit crops were often due to the planting of infertile\r\nvarieties. Investigations as to the self-sterility of pears, plums and\r\ngrapes have shown blossoming-time to be one of the most important life\r\nperiods of these fruits. The knowledge obtained by workers in this field\r\nhas to some degree modified the planting of all orchard-fruits and of\r\nnone more than of the plums. Indeed, it is held by many that it is hardly\r\nsafe to plant any excepting the Domestica and Insititia plums without\r\nprovision for cross-pollination.\r\n\r\nA variety is in need of cross-pollination when the pollen from its\r\nown blossoms does not fecundate the ovules of the variety. There is a\r\ndelicate and complicated procession during the process of fruit formation\r\nand the life of the fruit may be jeopardized by any one of a number\r\nof external or internal influences. These deleterious influences are\r\nmost often unfavorable weather or defects in the reproductive organs\r\nof the plants themselves. Of the latter, in the plum there are several\r\nrather common ones which cause self-sterility, as impotency of pollen,\r\ninsufficiency of pollen, defective pistils and difference in the time\r\nbetween the maturity of the pollen and the receptiveness of the stigmas.\r\n\r\nIt is held that the main cause of the infertility in plums is impotency\r\nof pollen on the pistils of the same variety. The pollen may be produced\r\nin abundance, be perfect as regards appearance, and potent on the pistils\r\nof other varieties but wholly fail to fecundate the ovaries of the\r\nvariety from which it came. The most marked examples of such impotency\r\nare to be found in the native plums though the Triflora sorts are\r\ngenerally accredited with being largely self-sterile and the Domesticas\r\nsomewhat so. The proof offered to show the impotency of plums is for most\r\npart the records of fruit setting under covered blossoms. In this method\r\nof testing the impotency of pollen there are several sources of error\r\nand the figures given by experimenters probably greatly exaggerate the\r\ninfertility of plums, but since the experience of plum-growers generally\r\naffirms the results in some measure it is well to hold that the native\r\nplums at least should be so planted as to secure cross-pollination. It is\r\ndoubtful if the Domestica and Triflora plums are self-sterile and yet\r\nthe question is an open one as regards some varieties of these species.\r\n\r\nThere is great difference in the quantity of pollen produced by the\r\nseveral groups of plums but it is very doubtful if insufficiency of\r\npollen is a factor of any considerable importance in the self-sterility\r\nof this fruit. Yet the matter is worth attention because of its bearing\r\nupon the selection of pollinizers. Of the several botanic groups,\r\nspeaking somewhat generally, the Americanas and Nigras bear most\r\npollen; the Munsoniana plums are abundant pollen bearers; the Trifloras\r\nseldom show a shortage but bear rather less than the others named; the\r\nDomesticas produce pollen abundantly; while the hybrid groups are the\r\nmost capricious of all the plums in this respect, some varieties bearing\r\nmuch and others but little pollen. Probably the amount of pollen which\r\nthe flowers of any tree produce is somewhat modified by the climate in\r\nwhich the tree is growing, by the weather and by the vigor of the tree.\r\n\r\nWaugh[147] and Goff[148] have shown that self-sterile plums often have\r\nabnormal pistils or pistils too weak for the development of fruits. Not\r\ninfrequently flowers of the plum are without pistils, as occasionally,\r\nbut less rarely, occurs with the stamens and petals. These abnormalities\r\ncannot be very general causes of self-sterility in plums, however, as\r\nvarieties, or even trees, cannot often be found which are not fruitful\r\nif other varieties are growing near them. It is very doubtful if even\r\nso much as fifty per ct. of abnormal flowers, seriously jeopardizes a\r\nplum crop, as the trees bear, if they blossom at all, several times as\r\nmany flowers as they can mature plums. But a high percentage of abnormal\r\nflowers nearly always indicates a general weakness in fruit-setting.\r\n\r\nAnother cause often assigned for the failure of plums to set fruit is\r\nthe difference in time of maturity of stamens and pistils. It is claimed\r\nthat when these organs do not mature simultaneously the plums do not set\r\nunless pollen is supplied from some other source. The task of taking\r\nnotes at blossoming time on more than three hundred varieties of plums on\r\nthe grounds of this Station has given abundant opportunity to observe the\r\ncomparative degrees of maturity of pistils and stamens in varieties of\r\nthis fruit. In general the pistils mature first, often three or four days\r\nbefore the stamens. Rarely the pollen is disgorged before the stigmas\r\nare receptive. But stigmas remain receptive, weather conditions being\r\nfavorable, for several days and the pollen from all anthers is not shed\r\nat once and is produced with such seeming prodigality as to almost insure\r\nthe retaining of a sufficient amount to pollinate late-maturing stigmas.\r\nIn view of these considerations, premature or retarded ripening of either\r\npistils or stamens does not seem of great significance in the setting of\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements just made it may be seen that the main cause of the\r\nfailures to set fruit when trees bloom freely must be ascribed to the\r\nfailure of pollen to fertilize the pistils of the flowers of the same\r\nvariety. The solution of the problem of self-sterility in the main, then,\r\nis to so plant that varieties will be mutually cross-fertilized. In the\r\nselection of varieties for such cross-pollination two factors must be\r\nconsidered, simultaneity of blossoming and sexual affinity.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, if cross-fertilization is to play an important part in\r\nfruit-growing, in planting to secure it kinds must be chosen which come\r\ninto blossom at the same time as those they are expected to fertilize.\r\nThe table on pages 106 to 109 shows the sorts that bloom together or\r\nnearly enough so to make cross-pollination possible. It will be found\r\nupon examining the table that, under normal conditions and during the\r\naverage season, varieties of any one species overlap sufficiently for\r\nthe above purpose unless it be the very early and very late varieties.\r\nVariations due to locality and to season must be expected but within the\r\nbounds of New York these will be slight. If the table is used for other\r\nregions than New York it must be borne in mind that the farther south,\r\nthe longer the blossoming season; the farther north, the shorter the\r\nseason. Properly interpreted the table of dates should be a useful guide\r\nas to the simultaneity of blooming.\r\n\r\nVarieties of plums seem to have sexual affinities. That is, some\r\nvarieties will fertilize each other very well and some will not, even\r\nthough they belong to the same species. There seems to be little definite\r\nknowledge as to the sexual affinities of plums and it is not, therefore,\r\npossible to lay down exact rules for the selection of pollinizers for\r\nindividual varieties. In the current discussions of cross-pollination\r\nit is probable that the importance of “affinities” is over-rated, and\r\nyet the subject is worthy of consideration. Waugh and Kerr have given\r\nthis subject considerable attention for native and Japanese plums and\r\nhave recommended a list of pollinizers for the several species.[149]\r\nThe Domesticas and Insititias, the above writers hold, are best\r\ncross-pollinated by varieties from the same species if cross-pollination\r\nis essential.\r\n\r\nThe subject cannot be closed without the expression of the opinion\r\nthat the lack of cross-pollination as a cause of the uncertainties in\r\nthe setting of fruit has been over estimated in the planting of plum\r\norchards. This expression of doubt is made because there are serious\r\ndisadvantages in the planting of mixed orchards of any fruit and the\r\nquestion as to whether these do not outweigh the advantages must ever be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATIONS AND SOILS FOR PLUMS.\r\n\r\nThe plum is comparatively easy to suit in the matter of location of\r\norchards, as is shown by the exceedingly wide range of this fruit in New\r\nYork. Plums are grown with eminent success on the elevated and sloping\r\nlands adjoining the Great Lakes, the Central Lakes of western New York\r\nand on both banks of the Hudson. Unquestionably there are many other\r\nlocalities than those named about the waterways of the State and also\r\nupon the elevated lands in the western interior formed by morainic hills,\r\nand upon the slopes of the mountains in eastern New York. Upon any land\r\nin the State suited to general farm crops, where the severity of winter\r\nis tempered by the lay of the land or proximity to water, and where late\r\nspring frosts are infrequent, plums may be grown. The early blooming\r\nplums, the Trifloras in particular, require more or less consideration\r\nas to the slope of land, a northern exposure to retard blooming-time\r\nbeing best. With other species the direction of the slope makes little\r\ndifference, though a slope for air and water drainage is always better\r\nthan a dead level.\r\n\r\nThe plum is now thriving in New York, and in the country at large, in a\r\ngreat diversity of soils. The chief requisite for the genus in general\r\nseems to be good drainage. Given this condition, some sort of plums can\r\nbe grown on almost any soil found in America not wholly prohibitive of\r\nplant growth. Plums can be found which will stand rather more water than\r\nany other of the tree-fruits, and since plums can be grafted on several\r\nstocks, each having its own adaptation to soils, the adaptability of the\r\ngenus is still further increased. Yet the several species have somewhat\r\ndecided soil preferences.\r\n\r\nThe Domesticas and Insititias, the plums now almost exclusively grown\r\nin New York, grow most satisfactorily, all things considered, on rich\r\nclay loams. The plum orchards in this State on such soils contain the\r\nlargest and most productive trees and produce the choicest fruit from\r\nthe standpoints of size, appearance and quality. Yet there are exceptions\r\nin which exceedingly fine Domestica plums are grown on light loams. The\r\nStation collection of about two hundred varieties of European plums is\r\non stiff clay, but well drained, and the results are uniformly good.\r\nThe Americanas and Nigras grow very well on much the same soils as the\r\nEuropean sorts, speaking from the experience on the grounds of this\r\nStation, for varieties of these species are not generally grown in New\r\nYork. Beyond question the Triflora plums, next most widely grown in\r\nNew York after the Domesticas, are giving the best results on light\r\nsoils—those most favorable for the peach. The ideal soil for this species\r\nis a sandy or gravelly loam but they are growing well on soils having\r\neither more sand or more clay than the ideal types. The Hortulana and\r\nMunsoniana plums incline to the comparatively light types of soils named\r\nas being best for the Trifloras rather than to the heavier lands on which\r\nthe European plums are most commonly grown.\r\n\r\nPlum-growers are well aware of the necessity of good drainage for this\r\nfruit but few seem to realize the importance of warmth in a plum soil.\r\nThe plum, in common with all stone-fruits, grows best, as a rule, on\r\nsoils having the power to absorb and retain heat, or if the soil have not\r\nthese properties the location and the cultivation should be such as to\r\nprovide as far as possible for “bottom heat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS AND PROPAGATION.\r\n\r\nA discussion of stocks naturally follows one of soils, for the two are\r\nintimately related. The plum can be successfully grown on various stocks\r\nand for this reason the practices of nurserymen are diverse, depending\r\nupon the cost of the stocks, the ease with which they may be budded or\r\ngrafted and the adaptability of the tree to the stocks. Unfortunately\r\nthere is little experimental data to show which of the several stocks is\r\nbest for the different plums and since growers seldom know what stocks\r\ntheir plums are growing upon they can give almost no information as to\r\nthe desirability of propagating on this stock or that. Nurserymen know\r\nthe stocks best adapted to their purpose and from them we have sought\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nA letter of inquiry sent to representative nurserymen in all parts of\r\nthe United States as to the relative merits of the several stocks for\r\nthe different species of plums shows that plum propagators in different\r\nregions use somewhat different stocks. In New England and the North\r\nAtlantic States, the Myrobalan seems to be almost the universal choice,\r\nthe exception being a few propagators who claim that the Japanese sorts\r\nshould be worked on the peach, especially for sandy soils, and a few\r\nothers who are using Americana stocks for the American species.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic states south of Pennsylvania and in the Gulf states to\r\nthe Mississippi the preferences are very diverse, with the majority of\r\nthe nurserymen in this region favoring the peach, Myrobalan following as\r\na close second choice. For light soils it would seem that the peach is\r\nalways to be preferred for this great region. The opinions expressed by\r\nthe veteran plum-grower, J. W. Kerr of Denton, Maryland, on this subject\r\nare worth printing in full. He says:\r\n\r\n    “In this locality for all varieties of the Domesticas that\r\n    unite thoroughly with it, the peach is preferable as a stock.\r\n    There are, however, a good many varieties of Domesticas that\r\n    refuse to unite firmly with the peach. For these the Marianna\r\n    or the Myrobalan gives best results. For all of the Japanese\r\n    plums the peach has proved most satisfactory, when the trees\r\n    are propagated by root-grafting on the whole-root plan. Nearly\r\n    forty years of experimenting and testing stocks of various\r\n    kinds gives me a decided preference for the peach as a stock\r\n    for native plums; results doubtless would be different in\r\n    colder climates and soils than this, but long and critical\r\n    experience has conclusively demonstrated the superiority of\r\n    this stock when used as indicated for the Japanese.”\r\n\r\nIn the interior region between the Atlantic and Gulf States and the\r\nMississippi, the Myrobalan is used almost exclusively for the European\r\nplums and most largely for the other species. Several nurserymen from\r\nthis region, however, state that the St. Julien is better than the\r\nMyrobalan for the Domesticas and Insititias but object to them because\r\nthe stocks cannot be obtained as cheaply. The peach is generally\r\nrecommended for the Triflora sorts and the statement is several times\r\nrepeated that the Americanas would be preferred for the native species if\r\nstocks of this species could be obtained readily.\r\n\r\nIn the northern states of the Mississippi Valley, all nurserymen agree\r\nthat plums must be worked on Americana stocks. In this region the hardy\r\nnatives only are grown.\r\n\r\nSouth of the northern tier in the states of the plains the Myrobalan is\r\nused almost exclusively for the European species, most largely for the\r\nTrifloras, with the peach second for this species, and Americana stocks\r\nfor the native species. Stark Brothers of Louisiana, Missouri, large\r\ngrowers of nursery stock in this region, express the opinion that “the\r\nright stock for native plums is yet to be found.” In Oklahoma, Texas and\r\nNew Mexico the Marianna is mentioned by several nurserymen as desirable,\r\nand is, from these statements, rather more commonly used for stocks in\r\nthese states at present than in any other region.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific Coast propagators use Myrobalan and peach in about equal\r\nquantities—the first named for heavy soils and the last for the lighter\r\nsoils. The native plums are not grown in this region. The almond is\r\nmentioned as being desirable in California under some conditions. Some\r\nplum-growers in the states of the Pacific propagate their own trees from\r\nsuckers.\r\n\r\nThe information given by nurserymen shows that by far the greatest number\r\nof plums in the country are grown on Myrobalan stocks. In New York this\r\nstock is used almost exclusively. In Europe the writer found that the\r\nnurserymen hold that this is a dwarfing stock, and that the trees on it\r\nare shorter-lived than on some other stocks. In the nurseries in New\r\nYork, plums in general, but more especially the Europeans, are larger\r\nand finer trees at two years, the selling age, grown on Myrobalan roots\r\nthan trees grown on other stocks. Nurserymen lodge but two complaints\r\nagainst it; these are that in the South it suckers badly and in the\r\ncold states of the Great Plains the roots are killed by the winters.\r\nIts advantages from the tree-growers’ standpoint are: Cheapness of the\r\nstock, which is usually imported from France, large handsome trees in the\r\nnursery, ease of budding and a good union with nearly all varieties. Some\r\ngrowers complain that certain varieties overgrow this stock making in\r\nthe end a badly mal-formed trunk. The Myrobalan plums are very variable,\r\na fact which finds record in nearly all the characters of tree and\r\nfruit and this is somewhat against it as a stock. It is for this reason\r\nthat there are so many “true” and “false” Myrobalans among nurserymen.\r\nMany importers hold that this stock is grown in France from cuttings.\r\nSuch it seems was the old practice but now, if information from France\r\nis correct, most of these stocks are grown from seed. Hansen reports\r\nthat in South Dakota this stock is worthless because it winter-kills.\r\nHe says[150] “in experiments at this Station a very small per cent. of\r\nMyrobalan stocks survived the first winter and these died the ensuing\r\nsummer.” It is likely that this stock would suffer in the coldest parts\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nIn this region the St. Julien is probably the next most common stock in\r\nplum orchards though trees on it are for most part old, as its use is\r\non the decrease. There is a wide-spread opinion among plum-growers that\r\nthis is a much better stock for Domestica and Insititia plums than any\r\nother. On St. Julien stocks varieties of these species, it is claimed,\r\nwith much to substantiate the claim, produce trees that are longer-lived,\r\nthriftier, hardier, deeper feeders, sprout less and are less susceptible\r\nto changes in soils. The chief objections to this stock are: It is more\r\nexpensive, sometimes scarcely obtainable in France; difficult to bud; the\r\nyoung trees do not make as good growth as on the Myrobalan stocks; and\r\nthe yearlings are much more susceptible to fungi while in the nursery\r\nrow, though the latter troubles can be remedied wholly or in part by\r\nspraying. Hansen, in the reference given above, says that “the St. Julien\r\nand European Sloe (_Prunus spinosa_) both winter-killed” in South Dakota\r\nwhen used as stocks. The St. Julien stock is propagated from layers when\r\nproperly grown in France[151] but much undesirable stock is now raised\r\nfrom seed. There are fruiting trees of this stock about the nurseries\r\nin the neighborhood of this Station which show it to be an Insititia\r\nof the Damson type, a type likely to come fairly true to seed yet not\r\nsufficiently so as to make seed-grown trees desirable.\r\n\r\nThe Horse plum was formerly used as a stock by nurserymen a great deal\r\nbut is now wholly superseded. Indeed, it is so nearly lost to the trade\r\nas to make it almost impossible to really know what the plum of this name\r\nis. Some describe it as a small-fruited Domestica, others as an Insititia\r\nsimilar to the St. Julien, but the majority of the trees shown by old\r\nnurserymen in the nursery region of New York, about the only place in\r\nwhich the stock was used, show it to be a Cerasifera but not Myrobalan.\r\nSome of the named varieties of Cerasifera probably sprung from sprouts of\r\nthis stock. It seems to have had no qualities which would make it worth\r\nwhile to attempt to re-establish the stock.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of a large number of nurserymen is in favor of the peach\r\nas a stock for plums. Budded on the peach, plums of many varieties are\r\ngrown very successfully on the warm sandy and gravelly soils so well\r\nsuited to the peach. This stock enables the tree to make a quick growth\r\nand come into bearing early, and the roots do not produce sprouts. The\r\nbudding with the peach is easily done, the young trees make a vigorous\r\ngrowth in the nursery and plums on peach roots can probably be grown at\r\na less cost than on any other stock. Triflora plums in particular make\r\nexcellent trees worked upon peach stock, the roots are as hardy as the\r\ntops and the union is sufficiently congenial to make the resulting tree\r\nlong-lived. For the Domestica and Insititia plums the peach stock is not\r\nso valuable, for with some varieties a good union is not secured and the\r\nroots are less hardy than the tops. Among the varieties which nurserymen\r\nsay will not unite with the peach are: Lombard, Damsons, Yellow Egg and\r\nWashington. Peach borers are sometimes troublesome when plums are budded\r\non peach stocks.\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, in his statement regarding stocks, on page 115, says that it is\r\nhis practice to whip-graft the plum on “whole-root” peach roots obtaining\r\neventually the plum on its own roots. This method is certainly well\r\nadapted to Mr. Kerr’s conditions but whether it would do in heavier soils\r\nand a colder climate is doubtful. One would suspect that some varieties\r\nof Domesticas and Insititias at least would sprout badly.\r\n\r\nIn the South, more particularly Texas and the Southwest, Marianna stocks\r\nfind favor, though their use seems to be on the decrease. The advantages\r\nof this stock are such as appeal to the nurserymen rather than to the\r\nplum-grower. These are that the Marianna readily strikes root from\r\ncuttings and the growth in the nursery is all that can be desired.\r\nCuttings strike more easily in the South than in the North, hence its\r\npopularity in the first named region.\r\n\r\nFor the colder parts of the Great Plains and as far east as to include\r\nWisconsin, Americana seedlings are the only stocks that will withstand\r\nthe winter. In this region Americana stocks are, of course, used only for\r\nthe native plums and data seem to be lacking as to whether other plums\r\ncultivated for their fruit could be grown on this stock or not. The W.\r\n& T. Smith Company of Geneva report that they are now using Americana\r\nseedlings for native plums for their eastern trade, speaking of them as\r\nfollows: “We think we get a larger growth and a better root system by\r\nusing the native (Americana) stocks. We also consider that the Flowering\r\nAlmonds, _Prunus triloba_ and _Prunus pissardi_, make a better growth on\r\nnative stocks.” From the last statement one would suspect that it would\r\nbe feasible to grow other orchard plums than the native species on this\r\nstock. As yet Americana seedlings are expensive, and until they cost\r\nless their use in competition with the Myrobalan and peach stocks will\r\nbe almost precluded. The chief fault of the Americana stock is that the\r\ntrees sucker rather badly.\r\n\r\nBesides the plants discussed above various nondescript members of the\r\ngenus Prunus are used as stocks for cultivated plums under particular\r\ncircumstances or for particular purposes. Seedlings of Munsoniana plums\r\nare supposed to be preeminently adapted for low wet lands. J. W. Kerr\r\nbelieves that seedlings of _Prunus hortulana_ are excellent stocks\r\nfor native plums as they never sucker.[152] The Sand plum (_Prunus\r\nangustifolia watsoni_) offers possibilities as a stock for dwarfing\r\nlarger growing species. According to Hansen,[153] who reviews the\r\nliterature and describes several experiments of his own, the western Sand\r\ncherry (_Prunus besseyi_) dwarfs varieties worked upon it and has the\r\nmerits of being extremely hardy and of producing trees which bear early\r\nand abundantly. As stated in the discussion of Subcordata, stocks of this\r\nplum have been used on the Pacific Coast and discarded because it dwarfs\r\ntrees and suckers badly. According to Wickson,[154] the apricot and\r\nalmond are sometimes used as stocks for plums in California and in some\r\ninstances with considerable success.\r\n\r\nLastly, suckers are not uncommonly used by plum-growers for certain\r\nvarieties. Thus in the western part of New York, the plum-growing region\r\nof the East, several varieties as the Reine Claudes and some of the\r\nDamsons are propagated from sprouts taken from the base of old trees.\r\nThis method can be used, of course, only when the trees are grown\r\nupon their own roots. The writer was told by plum-growers in Germany\r\nand France that most of the plums in gardens and small plantations,\r\nconstituting the majority of the plums in the two countries, were\r\npropagated from suckers. This method has small merit except that it\r\nenables a grower to get a few trees cheaply and perhaps gives a better\r\ntree of some varieties for a heavy soil. Beyond question it gives trees\r\nwith a tendency to sucker—an undesirable attribute.\r\n\r\nIn the horticultural literature of the time recommendations for\r\ntop-working plums are rather frequent. It is true that many varieties\r\nof plums grow slowly and make crooked growths, especially in the\r\nnursery, but in the attempts at grafting in New York the failures are\r\nmore conspicuous than the successes. If top-working is decided upon,\r\nthe earlier in the life of the tree it is done, the better. For the\r\nDomesticas at least, the Lombard is probably the best stock. The method\r\nof top-working is to graft in early spring or bud in late summer.\r\nGrafting ought to be used more often than it is to renew the tops of\r\ninjured trees, as the difficulties in doing this are not much greater\r\nthan in the case of apples.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUM ORCHARDS AND THEIR CARE.\r\n\r\nPlum trees in New York are set from twelve to twenty feet apart. The\r\namount of room given seems to depend mostly upon the custom in the\r\nlocality, though, as all agree, it should depend upon the soil and\r\nthe variety. The deduction which plum-growers are drawing from these\r\nexperiences is that the plum should have more room than is generally\r\ngiven it, therefore, wider plantings are more the rule now than formerly.\r\nLittle attention has been paid to mixed planting for cross-pollination\r\nin this State, as the Domesticas are planted almost exclusively and seem\r\nunder orchard conditions to be self-fertile.\r\n\r\nIn this region plum trees are usually planted two years from the bud, the\r\nexception being the Japanese which are sometimes set at a year from the\r\nbud. Plum trees in the past have been headed at three or four feet above\r\nthe ground but the tendency now is to head them lower—half the above\r\ndistances, and in orchards so planted there seems to be no inconvenience\r\nin tilling with modern implements. In the commercial orchards of the\r\nState the heads are formed of four or five main branches and in the\r\ncase of the Domesticas and Insititias about a central trunk but with\r\nthe Trifloras the leader is often removed leaving a vase-formed head.\r\nAfter the head is formed the subsequent pruning is simple, consisting of\r\ncutting out injured and crossed branches and heading-in long, whip-like\r\ngrowths. The Trifloras receive more pruning than the European varieties,\r\nas much of the fruit is borne on the growth of the previous season and it\r\nis necessary to keep the bearing wood near the trunk. It is the custom to\r\ncut rank growing Trifloras severely but the value of such a procedure is\r\ndoubtful, as the more such a plum is pruned the more it will need pruning\r\nin the years to follow. A better plan seems to be to curtail the food and\r\nprune as little as possible, though on rich soils the tree would probably\r\ngrow out of all bounds unless cut back somewhat year after year.\r\n\r\nAbout the only cultivated native plums to be found in New York, if a\r\nfew Wild Goose trees here and there are excepted, are on the grounds\r\nof this Station. Experience here demonstrates that, prune as you will,\r\ncertain varieties of the native species will remain crooked, ungainly and\r\nunkempt. Pruning some varieties is necessary in order to permit pickers\r\nto get into the dense, thorny heads; heading-in such varieties would make\r\ntheir tops wholly impenetrable.\r\n\r\nIn common with all tree-fruits the best plum orchards are tilled. Such\r\ntillage usually consists of plowing in the spring followed by frequent\r\ncultivation until the middle of August, at which time a cover-crop of\r\nclover, oats or barley is sown. The plum seems to require more water\r\nthan other tree-fruits—it often thrives in comparatively moist land and\r\nfails on sandy soils where the peach would grow luxuriantly. Cultivation\r\nto save moisture is very necessary for the plum in the experience of New\r\nYork growers. Grass and grain have proved ruinous in most orchards where\r\ntried, though cultivated crops between young trees to pay for keep until\r\nfruiting-time are very generally planted. The claim is made by some, and\r\nwith a show of reason, that there is less of the brown-rot in tilled\r\norchards than in neglected ones for the reason that the mummied fruits\r\nwhich carry the fungus through the winter are buried by plowing and with\r\nshallow cultivation, at least, do not come to light and life.\r\n\r\nPlum-growers very generally recognize the several distinct and valuable\r\npurposes which cover-crops serve in orchards. They protect the tree from\r\nroot-killing, from cold, keep the soil from washing, add humus and,\r\nwith legumes, nitrogen to the soil, modify the physical structure of\r\nthe soil and hasten seasonal maturity of the tree. There is one other\r\nfunction which is not so often taken into account. Plum orchards in\r\nwhich cover-crops are regularly grown, even though the crop be not a\r\nlegume, need less fertilizers than those in which no such crop is grown.\r\nThere are several reasonable suppositions as to why there should be such\r\nan effect, but one not usually given sufficient consideration is that\r\ncover-crops make available much plant food in the soil. Each plant in the\r\ncrop collects food from soil and air, most of it otherwise unavailable,\r\nand turns it over to the trees.\r\n\r\nA discussion of fertilizers naturally follows. Present practices in the\r\nuse of fertilizers with the plum, as with other fruits, are very diverse.\r\nIt is impossible to ascertain what considerations have governed the\r\napplications of fertilizers in the plum orchards of New York or what the\r\nresults have been. Too often, it is to be feared, fertilizers have been\r\nused as “cure-alls” for any or all of the ills to which trees are heirs.\r\nOut of the mass of conflicting data as to the effects of fertilizers on\r\nplums, the most apparent fact is that much of the fertilizers for this\r\nfruit is wasted; this in face of the fact that plums want rich soils. But\r\nthe plum crop is mostly water, the foliage remains on the ground, the\r\ntrees grow several years before fruiting, their growing season is from\r\nearly spring until late fall, the roots go deep and spread far, the trees\r\ntranspire large amounts of water, hence may thrive on diluted solutions\r\nof plant food, and now and then there is an off year in bearing for the\r\ntrees to recuperate.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow from the above consideration that plums never need\r\nfertilizers, but it does seem plain that they need rather less than truck\r\nor farm crops and that applications of plant food must be made with\r\nexceedingly great care if fertilizing is to be done without waste. There\r\nis a growing disposition on the part of plum-growers to experiment very\r\ncarefully and know that they are getting the worth of their money before\r\nusing any considerable quantity of fertilizers for their trees.\r\n\r\nThinning the fruit should be a regular practice with plum-growers, but\r\nit is the operation in the growing of this fruit about which growers are\r\nmost careless both as to whether it is done at all and in the manner\r\nof doing. Many growers in New York, realizing the great necessity of\r\nthinning certain varieties of Triflora, as Burbank and Abundance, follow\r\nthe practice very regularly with plums of this group; but the Domesticas\r\nare seldom well thinned, though some of them, of which Lombard is a\r\nconspicuous example, ought nearly always to have anywhere from one-fifth\r\nto half of the fruit removed. Growers of some of the native varieties in\r\nregions where these sorts are grown say that under cultivation some kinds\r\nof these plums will bear themselves to death if a part of the crop be not\r\nremoved in most years. Those growers in New York who thin, do the work as\r\nsoon as possible after the June drop has taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING AND MARKETING.\r\n\r\nPlum trees in this climate begin to bear when set from three to five\r\nyears. The Triflora varieties will bear soonest, the Old World varieties\r\nnext in order, say at four years from setting, and the native sorts, as\r\na rule, come in bearing last. At eight or ten years of age, prolific\r\nvarieties of the Triflora and Domestica sorts bear in a good year about\r\nthree bushels of fruit; the Insititia and native varieties, on the\r\nStation grounds, at least, do not bear as much, though most of the plums\r\nof these two groups bear more regularly than the first named groups.\r\n\r\nPlums in this State, and east of the Mississippi generally, are picked\r\nand put upon the market just before they reach edible condition; while\r\nfarther away they must be picked much greener. It is the practice in the\r\nEast to pick while still somewhat green because the fruit so picked is\r\nbest handled at this stage of maturity and the brown-rot fungus is likely\r\nto destroy much of the crop if left until fully matured. Some of the\r\nTriflora sorts, Abundance, Burbank and October, for example, are picked\r\nfrom a week to ten days before ripe and yet develop very good color and\r\nflavor. The Domesticas need not be, and are not, picked quite so green.\r\nIn picking, great diversity exists as to ladders, receptacles, and manner\r\nof conveyance from orchard to packing house. These need not be discussed\r\nhere, nor need the methods of picking be spoken of further than to say\r\nthat while good growers consider it vital not to bruise the fruit nor\r\ndestroy the delicate bloom, if such injuries can be avoided, pickers in\r\ngeneral are not nearly as observant of these important details as they\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nThe plum crop is sent to market, for most part in New York, in six,\r\neight and ten-pound grape baskets with the preference at present for the\r\nsmallest of these baskets. Occasionally some fruit is packed in four\r\npound baskets. Rarely, and always to the disadvantage of both producer\r\nand consumer, plums go to market in the packages in which the fruit\r\nis picked. Indeed, it is seldom advantageous to pack the fruit in the\r\nfield, it being far better to convey it to the packing house where the\r\npreparations for shipping may be more carefully made, as the package and\r\nthe manner of packing advertise the product. Plums coming to this State\r\nfrom the far West are often wrapped individually in tissue paper as a\r\nhelp in safe shipping and to add to their attractiveness but the fruit\r\ngrown in the State is seldom, if ever, so treated, though it is possible\r\nthat choice specimens could be profitably wrapped. Of the sorting,\r\ngrading, facing and marking the packages, little need be said except\r\nthat they are too rarely well done in present methods, though there is a\r\nsteady improvement in attending to these important matters.\r\n\r\nFew plums are stored longer than a week at most in common storage and\r\nthree weeks or a month is quite the limit for most varieties in cold\r\nstorage. Late plums and in particular some of the prunes might well be\r\nstored longer than is now the custom if proper precautions are taken, as\r\nis shown by the experience at this Station where a considerable number\r\nof the Domestica and Insititia varieties are annually kept in common\r\nstorage for a month or longer without unusual precautions. Some of the\r\nnew varieties offered to growers, as Apple and Occident, are recommended\r\nas keeping for several weeks after picking. There is a most marked\r\ndifference in the keeping qualities of this fruit and it is certain that\r\nvarieties can now be selected for long keeping and that there is a fine\r\nopportunity for breeding sorts that will keep even longer than any we now\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nMarketing, the actual selling, is a business quite by itself, and since\r\nit is one which has changed greatly in the past few years and is destined\r\nto change even more in the near future, a few observations on the subject\r\nare worth putting on record. A well developed local market is undoubtedly\r\nthe best selling place for the plum producer, as in it the sales are\r\ndirectly to the consumer, eliminating expensive middlemen. The westward\r\nspread of manufacturing industries, the workers in which use up the\r\nwestern-grown fruit, is making better local markets for eastern plums, a\r\npoint worth noting, for many New York plum-growers have ceased planting,\r\nindeed have been removing trees, fearing western competition.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the plum crop now finds its way to consumers\r\nthrough the following costly distributive system: 1st. Local buyers who\r\nship to centers of consumption. 2nd. Transportation companies. 3rd.\r\nCommission companies who collect and distribute the crop in consuming\r\ncenters. 4th. Retailers who parcel out the quantities and the qualities\r\ndemanded by the consumer. The great defect in handling the crop is,\r\nthat there are too many men and too much machinery to do the work\r\ncheaply—moreover, the risks of depreciation are great, and the fruit is\r\nnot handled on a large scale chiefly because of a lack of capital by the\r\ngrower or local buyer. These defects in the present distribution of plums\r\nin New York make the price received by the grower about half that paid\r\nby the consumer and the selling of the crop a more or less speculative\r\nbusiness. The plum industry, as is the case with all fruits, is greatly\r\nhampered by the present marketing systems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is yet but a small outlet for surplus plums as\r\nmanufactured products. As a rule the commercial outlook is best for those\r\nfruits of which the surplus can be turned into by-products. The only\r\noutlet for the plum in the East is in canning, as this region is unable\r\nto compete with the West in the making of prunes[155] and as the several\r\nplum products of the Old World are not in demand in the New World. Beyond\r\nquestion there are a number of products, as preserves, jellies from\r\nthe native plums, glacé fruits, plum butter, marmalades and the like,\r\nwhich could be made profitable for the markets and thus a great help in\r\nutilizing surplus plums.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES.\r\n\r\nPlums are subject to a considerable number of fungus diseases, several of\r\nwhich are often virulent, the virulence depending on locality, season,\r\nweather and variety. Happily for the plum industry, knowledge of plant\r\npathology has made such advancements in recent years that nearly all of\r\nthe diseases of this fruit are now controlled by preventive or remedial\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest and most striking of the diseases of the plum is\r\nblack-knot[156] (_Plowrightia morbosa_ (Schw.) Saccardo) characterized\r\nby wartlike excrescences on shoots and branches. In early summer these\r\nknots are dark green, soft and velvety, but as the fungus ripens in the\r\nfall the color changes to a carbon-like black and the knots become hard\r\nand brittle. The disease is usually confined to one side of the twig\r\nor branch so that death of the affected part does not ensue at once.\r\nBlack-knot is an American malady, at one time confined to the eastern\r\npart of the continent where in some localities its ravages forced the\r\nabandonment of plum-growing. The fungus is now endemic to wild or\r\ncultivated plants in practically all the plum-growing regions of the\r\ncontinent, but it is still epidemic only in the East, the South and West\r\nbeing practically free from the disease. Unless especially virulent\r\nblack-knot is controlled by cutting out the diseased wood. Usually\r\neradication is not possible without several prunings during a season.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made of the supposed immunity of some varieties of plums\r\nto black-knot. In the vicinity of this Station, where the disease is\r\nalways present and often rampant, the differences in immunity are not\r\nvery marked in varieties of the same species. The Trifloras are less\r\nattacked, however, than any other group of plums, and the Insititias\r\nrank next in immunity. No variety of the Domesticas has yet proved to\r\nbe free from the disease but strong claims are made that Middleburg and\r\nPalatine are relatively free.\r\n\r\nNext in order of seriousness among the diseases which attack cultivated\r\nplums is the brown-rot[157] (_Sclerotinia fructigena_ (Persoon)\r\nSchroeter) known also very commonly as the ripe-rot and sometimes as\r\npeach-blight. The disease is most conspicuous on the ripe fruits of the\r\nvarious drupes and is popularly supposed to be confined to the fruits\r\nalone. Such is not the case, for it also attacks, and very vigorously\r\noftentimes, the flowers and shoots. The presence of the disease on the\r\nfruits is known by a dark discoloration of the skin which is afterward\r\npartly or wholly covered by pustule-like aggregations of grayish spores.\r\nThe decayed fruits may fall to the ground, or as is more usual in the\r\ncase of plums, they hang to the tree and as the juice evaporates become\r\nshriveled mummies, each mummy being a storehouse of the fungus from which\r\ninfection spreads the following season. The twigs, flowers and leaves\r\nare known to be suffering from inroads of the parasite when they are\r\nblackened as if nipped by frost. In warm, damp weather the rot spreads\r\nwith great rapidity and fruits touching in clusters or in boxes stored\r\nfor shipping are well placed to spread the epidemic. Destruction of the\r\nmummy-like fruits and all other sources of infection, and spraying with\r\nbordeaux mixture are now practiced as preventives, but so far as the crop\r\nis concerned with but indifferent success. A better remedy than we now\r\nhave is eagerly looked for by growers of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe hosts of this fungus show varying degrees of susceptibility to it,\r\nthe peach and the sweet cherries being more subject to it than plums.\r\nSimilarly, among plums some species and varieties are more susceptible\r\nthan others. Thus the Trifloras and Americanas, the latter especially\r\nin the South, are injured more by the brown-rot than other species.\r\nThe idiosyncrasies of varieties in this regard are best shown in the\r\ndiscussions of the individual sorts.\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting and sometimes destructive diseases of plums are\r\ncaused by various species of the fungal genus Exoascus.[158] The most\r\ncommon of these, and the most striking and destructive, is plum-pockets\r\n(_Exoascus pruni_ Fuckel), which causes prominent deformities of\r\nthe fruit. These give the disease the common name or less frequently\r\n“bladders” and “curl.” The fungus attacks the developing fruits at an\r\nearly stage of their growth and causes the production of a spongy mass in\r\nthe fleshy tissue which greatly enlarges and distorts the plum. The stone\r\nin a diseased plum is but rudimentary or very often not at all developed.\r\nLess prominently but quite as frequently, the leaves are attacked,\r\nshowing as they unfold more or less red or yellow with a very decided\r\ncurling and arching of the leaf-blade. The disease usually spreads from\r\nthe leaves to the shoots, the infected shoots with their rosettes of\r\nmal-formed leaves giving the tree a most unsightly appearance. Prevention\r\nat present consists of removing the diseased parts and spraying with\r\nbordeaux mixture when the buds begin to swell. Munsoniana and Hortulana\r\nplums seem to be most susceptible to this disease. Atkinson[159] has\r\ndescribed several species of Exoascus on the different species of wild\r\nplums, some of which are liable to be found on the cultivated varieties\r\nof the native plums. They are all very similar to _Exoascus pruni_,\r\ndiffering chiefly, in the eyes of the layman, in forming smaller pockets.\r\nSturgis[160] records an attack of one of the leaf-curl fungi, distinct\r\nfrom the plum-pockets fungus, on varieties of Triflora in Connecticut,\r\nwhich seemed to him to be of scientific and economic importance.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the different species of cultivated plums are attacked by\r\nseveral fungi which produce diseased spots on the foliage, which for most\r\npart drop out, causing a shot-hole effect. These diseases pass under such\r\ndescriptive names as “shot-hole fungus,” “leaf-spot,” and “leaf-blight.”\r\nThe fungus probably responsible for most of this trouble is best known as\r\nthe shot-hole fungus[161] (_Cylindrosporium padi_ Karsten). The Domestica\r\nand Triflora varieties are very susceptible to this fungus, which, on the\r\nfoliage of the first, causes spots for most part, while on the latter the\r\nspots on the leaves are nearly always followed by holes. Varieties of the\r\nnative species, especially those of Americana and Nigra, are relatively\r\nfree from this disease. Another of these shot-hole fungi is _Cercospora\r\ncircumscissa_ Saccardo[162], much less common than the former, but still\r\nto be considered and especially on the foliage of Americana. All of these\r\ndiseases of the foliage are prevented to some degree by the proper use\r\nof bordeaux mixture, which, on the Triflora plums at least, must be used\r\nwith great care to avoid injury. Cultivation has a salutary effect as it\r\ndestroys the diseased leaves which harbor the fungi.\r\n\r\nAnother disease of plum foliage, occurring rarely on the fruit, is the\r\nplum-leaf rust[163] (_Puccinia pruni-spinosae_ Persoon) which produces so\r\nconsiderable a number of spore cases on the underside of the leaves as\r\nto give the foliage a brownish cast and to cause defoliation in severe\r\ninfections. The fungus is most apparent in the fall and most troublesome\r\nin warm, moist climates. Bordeaux is used as a preventive.\r\n\r\nStewart and Rolfs have shown that trunks and branches of plums affected\r\nby sunscald in New York are almost invariably infested by a fungus[164]\r\n(_Valsa leucostoma_ Persoon) which in the Old World is known as the\r\n“die back” of the peach. The disease manifests itself on plums chiefly\r\nby affected areas much depressed at the boundary between the living and\r\nthe dead bark, these areas usually, not always, having connection with\r\nsunscald injuries on the trunk. The disease is accompanied by more or\r\nless gumming.\r\n\r\nIn common with nearly all rosaceous plants, in nearly all countries,\r\nthe plum is sometimes seriously injured by the powdery mildew[165]\r\n(_Podosphaera oxyacanthae_ DeBary). The affected leaves have a grayish\r\nappearance caused by the parts of the fungus which project beyond the\r\nleaf tissue; when badly diseased the leaves are more or less arched and\r\ncurled. Mildew is seldom prevalent enough on plums to require treatment.\r\n\r\nThe crown gall,[166] (_Bacterium tumefaciens_ Smith and Townsend) is a\r\nparasite on all of the fruits of the order Rosaceae and is especially\r\ncommon on nursery stock, attacking plums in many soils but rarely,\r\nhowever, to the great injury of the plant. These galls are perennial\r\nstructures of very varying duration. They are to be found on the roots,\r\nusually at the collar of the plant, and vary from the size of a pea to\r\nthat of a man’s fist, forming at maturity, rough, knotty, dark-colored\r\nmasses. Means of prevention or cure are not established though all agree\r\nthat soils may be inoculated with the disease from infected stock; hence\r\nthe necessity of discarding diseased trees at transplanting time.\r\n\r\nSmith found in Michigan and Clinton in Connecticut a disease of the fruit\r\ncalled bacterial black spot[167] (_Pseudomonas pruni_ Smith) of the same\r\ngeneric origin as the crown gall but widely different in nature. The\r\nwriters and the growers who found the infected fruit, saw the disease\r\nonly on the Triflora plums. It attacks the green fruits which show\r\nconspicuous, black-purple, sunken spots sometimes as large as half an\r\ninch in diameter. The injuries are usually isolated and quite superficial\r\nbut nevertheless, spoil the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe plum in common with other stone-fruits often suffers from an\r\nexcessive flow of gum, for which trouble the name gummosis[168] is now\r\ngenerally applied. The disease is to be found wherever plums are grown\r\nbut it is much more destructive on the Pacific than on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. So far as is now known gummosis is secondary to injuries caused\r\nby fungi, bacteria, insects, frost, sunscald, and mechanical agencies.\r\nThe disease is least common in species and varieties having hard wood;\r\non trees on soils favoring the maturity of wood; under conditions where\r\nsun and frost are not injurious; and, obviously, in orchards where by\r\ngood care the primary causes of gumming are kept out. Stewart[169] has\r\nrecorded an interesting case of gum-pockets in the fruit, but could\r\nassign no cause.\r\n\r\nMechanical injuries from the sun, frost and hail are troubles with which\r\nnearly all plum-growers must contend at one time or another. In this\r\nregion the Reine Claude and Triflora plums suffer much from sunscald\r\nbut none are wholly immune, though Lombard is possibly most so. These\r\ninjuries from the elements of weather are often mistaken for diseases,\r\nand are so often followed by fungal parasites and insects as to make\r\nit difficult to distinguish the primary from the secondary trouble.\r\nLow-heading of the trees is the best preventive of these trunk injuries.\r\n\r\nPlums are somewhat subject to attacks of the well-known peach scab[170]\r\n(_Cladosporium carpophilum_ Thumen). The scab appears in numerous, small,\r\nsooty, circular spots of brownish color, often confined to one side of\r\na fruit but in other cases distributed over the whole surface. None of\r\nthe cultivated species are free from the disease but the Munsoniana,\r\nand Hortulana varieties are most susceptible to it. Pear blight,[171]\r\n(_Bacillus amylovorus_ (Burrill) DeToni) commonly thought of as a disease\r\nof the pear and apple has been found on various plums, and the yellows of\r\nthe peach, cause unknown, is often quite destructive to Triflora plums.\r\nAccording to Smith the peach rosette,[172] cause unknown, attacks both\r\nwild and cultivated plums in the South and is quickly fatal. The disease\r\nwas prevalent on the wild Angustifolias, on two varieties of Triflora,\r\nKelsey and Botan, but the observer had not seen rosette on varieties of\r\nDomestica.\r\n\r\nWaugh describes a trouble which he calls “flyspeck fungus”[173] found on\r\nfruits sent from the Southern States, in which small areas are thickly\r\ndotted with black spots; also a fruit-spot on plums from Texas caused, as\r\nhe states, by an undetermined Phoma.[174] Starnes of Georgia describes a\r\nmalady of the Triflora plums called “wilt,”[175] cause unknown, which he\r\nstates is the most serious obstacle to the culture of this plum in the\r\nSouth. In this peculiar disease the foliage passes directly from a green,\r\nhealthy state into a wilted and then parched condition, the death warrant\r\nbeing signed when a tree is once affected. In Oregon and Washington the\r\nItalian Prune is subject to a leaf-curl[176] which begins in mid-summer\r\nand curls the leaves conduplicately without withering but shriveling\r\nsomewhat. As the season advances the leaves turn yellow and many of them\r\ndrop. Neither cause nor cure is known. Smith described a plum-blight[177]\r\nof native plums in Georgia which “destroys large branches or even whole\r\ntrees in mid-summer in the course of a few weeks.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\nCultivated plums furnish food for a great number of insects. Many of the\r\ndestructive insect pests of the several cultivated species of Prunus\r\nare known to have come from the wild plants of the genus, but others,\r\nand possibly the majority, come from over the seas. No less than forty\r\nspecies of insects may be enumerated as pests of the plum and many\r\nmore can be counted as occasional parasites on one or another of the\r\nspecies. Of the formidable pests the plum curculio is probably the most\r\ntroublesome. The plum curculio[178] (_Conotrachelus nenuphar_ Herbst) is\r\na rough, grayish snout-beetle somewhat less than a quarter of an inch\r\nin length, an insect so familiar to fruit-growers as hardly to need\r\na description. The female beetle pierces the skin of the young plums\r\nand places an egg in the puncture. About this cavity she gouges out a\r\ncrescent-shaped trench, the puncture and trench making the “star and\r\ncrescent” of the Ottoman Empire, hence the common name of the beetle,\r\n“The Little Turk.” The egg-laying process may be repeated in a number\r\nof fruits and from each egg a larva hatches within a week and burrows\r\nto the stone, making a wormy fruit. Most of the infested plums drop. In\r\nyears past plum-growers relied upon jarring the beetles from the trees\r\nin the early morning, but the treatment was too expensive, and poisoning\r\nwith an arsenate is now the chief means of combating the pest. Rubbish\r\nand vegetation offer hiding places for the insects and hence cultivated\r\norchards are more free from curculio. Thin skinned varieties are damaged\r\nmost by the insect but there are no “curculio-proof” plums.\r\n\r\nA larger snout-beetle than the curculio, the plum gouger[179]\r\n(_Anthonomus scutellaris_ LeConte), occasionally does much damage to\r\nplums. The work of the gouger may be told from that of the curculio by\r\nthe absence of the crescent cut about the puncture made for the egg, and\r\nfrom the fact that the larvæ of this pest chiefly infest the stone and\r\nthose of the other insect the flesh of the plum. The remedies are the\r\nsame for the two insects though the gouger is more easily destroyed.\r\n\r\nAmong the several borers which are more or less destructive to species\r\nof Rosaceae only the peach borer[180] (_Sanninoidea exitiosa_ Say.)\r\nmay be counted as a troublesome pest of the plum. The larvæ of this\r\ninsect are frequently to be found in both wild and cultivated plum trees\r\nand must be combated in nearly all plum orchards east of the Rocky\r\nMountains. The prevention of the work of the borer is best accomplished\r\nby thorough cultivation, the use of coverings of tar and poisonous washes\r\nand mounding the trees. Destruction is effectively carried out only by\r\ndigging out the borer with knife or wire. The lesser peach borer[181]\r\n(_Sesia pictipes_ Grote & Robinson) attacks the plum and in New York has\r\nbeen found particularly injurious to the Wickson plums. The flat-headed\r\napple tree borer[182] (_Chrysobothris femorata_ Fabricius) is frequently\r\nfound in the wood of wild plums and is sometimes a pest of the several\r\ncultivated species. It is treated as is the peach borer. The shot-hole\r\nborer[183] (_Eccoptogaster rugulosus_ Ratzeburg) a diminutive insect\r\nwhich deposits its eggs in the trunks or large branches of various\r\nmembers of the genus Prunus, may be regarded as an effect rather than a\r\ncause of disease, for it seldom injures perfectly healthy plum trees.\r\nThe peach bark-beetle[184] (_Phlœotribus liminaris_ Harris) is somewhat\r\nsimilar in its work to the shot-hole borer and like it is found for most\r\npart only in diseased and decrepit trees.\r\n\r\nThe plum aphis[185] (_Aphis prunifolii_ Fitch) is sometimes very\r\ndestructive to varieties of the native plums, especially the Americanas,\r\nand occasionally injures or even kills the young trees of the Domestica\r\nsorts. It is not a formidable foe in New York, and it is the exception\r\nwhen trees must be treated for it, the treatment being any of the contact\r\nsolutions used against sucking insects. The cherry aphis[186] (_Myzus\r\ncerasi_ Linnaeus) and the green peach aphis[187] (_Myzus persicæ_ Sulzer)\r\nare much less common than the plum aphis on plum trees, but are sometimes\r\nabundant on foliage of this fruit and are combated in the same way as the\r\nmore common aphis. Gillette enumerates two other aphids as attacking the\r\nplum in Colorado—the rusty brown plum louse[188] (_Aphis setariæ_ Thomas)\r\nand the mealy plum louse[189] (_Hyalopterus arundinis_ Fabricius).\r\n\r\nSeveral scale insects infest the plum. Chief of these is the dreaded San\r\nJosé scale[190] (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_ Comstock) known and feared by\r\nall fruit-growers in the United States. The lime and sulphur solution\r\nis now the most common and probably the most effective spray for this\r\ninsect. The European fruit lecanium[191] (_Lecanium corni_ Bouche)\r\noccasionally does a great deal of damage in New York and now and then\r\ndestroys the whole crop in an orchard. The winter treatment for San\r\nJosé scale is used to control this pest, but usually such treatment\r\nis supplemented by a summer spray about July first with such contact\r\nsprays as whale oil soap and kerosene emulsion. Of the other scales[192]\r\nwhich feed upon plums and now and then become pestiferous the following\r\nmay be named: The fruit pulvinaria (_Pulvinaria amygdali_ Cockerell),\r\nthe mealy bug (_Pseudococcus longispinus_ Targioni), the scurfy scale\r\n(_Chionaspis furfura_ Fitch.), the West Indian peach scale (_Aulacaspis\r\npentagona_ Targioni), the Putnam scale (_Aspidiotus ancylus_ Putnam),\r\nthe cherry scale (_Aspidiotus forbesi_ Johnson), the walnut scale\r\n(_Aspidiotus juglans-regiæ_ Comstock), Howard’s scale (_Aspidiotus\r\nhowardii_ Cockerell), the European fruit scale (_Aspidiotus ostreæformis_\r\nCurtis), the red scale of California (_Chrysomphalus aurantii_ Maskell),\r\nthe oyster-shell scale (_Lepidosaphes ulmi_ Linnaeus), and the soft scale\r\n(_Coccus hesperidum_ Linnaeus).\r\n\r\nWild plums of several species seem to be favorite feeding grounds\r\nfor the tent caterpillar[193] (_Malacosoma americana_ Fabricius),\r\nbut cultivated plums are not so often attacked; the spraying with\r\narsenites usually given for the curculio is fatal to this pest as well.\r\nThe spring canker-worm[194] (_Paleacrita vernata_ Peck) and the fall\r\ncanker-worm[195] (_Alsophila pometaria_ Harris) are other caterpillars\r\nwhich often do much damage unless checked by destructive measures, of\r\nwhich the best are the arsenical sprays. The larvæ of a considerable\r\nnumber of other moths and butterflies are often found on plum foliage but\r\nseldom in such numbers as to require systematic destruction.\r\n\r\nThe eye-spotted bud-moth[196] (_Tmetocera ocellana_ Schiffermuller) is a\r\nrather serious pest in plum nurseries where the larvæ eat into the young\r\nbuds at the time they are opening, often destroying the shoots. Sometimes\r\nthe larvæ are found destroying buds on old trees. The arsenical sprays\r\nare used to destroy this pest. The peach twig-moth (_Anarsia lineatella_\r\nZeller) is now and then found in plum twigs but is seldom classed as a\r\nplum pest.\r\n\r\nThe clover mite[197] (_Bryobia pratensis_ Garman) formerly considered a\r\nserious pest of the plum only in the far West, is now abundant in plum\r\norchards in New York. It can be controlled by applications of lime and\r\nsulphur. The bumble-flower beetle[198] (_Euphoria inda_ Linnaeus) is\r\nreported by Goff to be occasionally very injurious to plums in Wisconsin.\r\nRemedies seem not to have been tried. The larvæ of the cherry slug[199]\r\n(_Selandria cerasi_ Peck) is not infrequently found doing damage to plum\r\nfoliage and occasionally the larvæ of one or two other saw-flies feed on\r\nthe plum. These are all overcome by the use of arsenical sprays. At least\r\none of the curious insects know as “case-bearers” attacks the plums. The\r\ntroublesome one is the pistol case-bearer[200] (_Coleophora malivorella_\r\nRiley), which is not often a pest but has sometimes done considerable\r\ndamage. Attempts to check this insect with the arsenical sprays have\r\nusually proved successful. The plum tree is a host-plant of the hop\r\naphis[201] (_Phorodon humuli_ Schrank). So much does this insect feed on\r\nthe plum that the destruction of plum trees in the vicinity of hop fields\r\nis recommended to hop-growers by Riley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLEADING VARIETIES OF PLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nABUNDANCE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABUNDANCE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

The two chief assets which have given the\r\nvariety its great popularity so quickly are adaptability to a wide\r\ndiversity of soils and climates and, as its name implies, abundance\r\nof fruit, for it bears not only heavily but yearly. As a market plum\r\nAbundance has been overplanted since it ships and keeps poorly, is much\r\nsubject to brown-rot, matures unevenly and drops rather too readily as\r\nit ripens. Whether for market or home use, the fruit of this variety\r\nshould be picked before it is quite ripe as it develops in flavor best\r\nwhen so picked and the dropping and rot are thus avoided to some extent.\r\nIt is an exceedingly variable plum and undoubtedly several well marked\r\nstrains could be selected, some of which are not as hardy or otherwise\r\nas valuable as others. While Abundance has passed the heyday of its\r\npopularity it is still one of the most desirable of the Triflora plums.\r\n\r\nThis variety was imported from Japan by Luther Burbank in 1884, and\r\nwas introduced by John T. Lovett, Little Silver, New Jersey, under the\r\nname Abundance, in 1888. A large number of Japanese plums that have\r\nsince been introduced have proved to be either identical or so nearly\r\nlike the Abundance that much confusion has arisen. Abundance was first\r\nknown as Botan, but that name was dropped as it refers to a group of\r\nplums in Japan rather than to a variety. Babcock, which is said to have\r\nbeen imported by Burbank in 1885 and named for Colonel E. F. Babcock,\r\na nurseryman of Little Rock, Arkansas, has been described by Bailey as\r\nindistinguishable from Abundance. Botankio, described in the Georgia\r\nHorticultural Society Report for 1889, proved to be the Abundance\r\nas tested at the Cornell Experiment Station. The Chase plum, also\r\ndisseminated in New York under the name Yellow Japan, was bought by the\r\nR. G. Chase Company, Geneva, New York, for the Abundance, but as it was\r\nthought to blossom and fruit later than that variety, it was distributed\r\nas a new plum; in 1897 Bailey considered it the same as Chabot, but in\r\n1899 he stated that it and Abundance were identical. The Douglas plum is\r\nalso identical. Dr. J. T. Whitaker of Tyler, Texas, imported this variety\r\nand introduced it in 1886 under the name of Hytankayo. Bailey, who tested\r\nWhitaker’s variety from trees obtained from T. V. Munson, Denison,\r\nTexas, found a yellow-fruited strain and to distinguish the purple form\r\nnamed the latter Munson.[202] As this name had been applied to a native\r\nplum, R. H. Price, of the Texas Experiment Station, in 1894 renamed\r\nthe variety calling it Douglas.[203] There have been two types of this\r\nDouglas plum disseminated; Bailey, in 1899, found no difference between\r\nit and Abundance except that the Douglas seemed to have a little drier\r\nflesh; others testing Douglas found it to be identical with the Chabot.\r\nBurbank No. 2, imported by Luther Burbank in 1885 and introduced by him\r\nin 1889, is very similar if not identical with the Abundance. Oriole,\r\nrecently introduced by the Texas Nursery Company, Sherman, Texas, is so\r\nnearly like Abundance as to be unworthy of a separate name. The American\r\nPomological Society added Abundance to its fruit catalog list in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, vasiform, open-topped, hardy in New\r\n    York, very productive, susceptible to attacks of shot-hole\r\n    fungus; branches rough, dark ash-gray, inclined to split when\r\n    overloaded, with few, slightly raised lenticels; branchlets\r\n    slender, short, with short internodes, red early in the season\r\n    changing to dark brown, glossy, glabrous, with numerous,\r\n    inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    conical, plump, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, narrow-obovate or oblanceolate,\r\n    peach-like, one and three-eighths inches wide, three and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, thin; upper surface light green,\r\n    smooth, glabrous, with grooved midrib; lower surface pale\r\n    green, pubescent on the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    taper-pointed, base cuneate, margin very finely serrate,\r\n    with small, brownish glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    slightly pubescent along one side, reddish, glandless or with\r\n    from one to five small, globose, green or reddish glands\r\n    usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early; flowers appearing with the leaves,\r\n    medium in size; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in\r\n    pairs or in threes; pedicels of medium length and thickness,\r\n    slightly pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, with ciliate margins, glabrous,\r\n    erect; petals broadly oval, entire, abruptly clawed; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments of average length; pistil glabrous, equal\r\n    to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and three-eighths inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish-ovate, halves nearly equal, slightly\r\n    compressed; cavity medium in depth and width, abrupt, regular;\r\n    suture shallow, distinct; apex pointed; color pinkish-red\r\n    changing to darker red, mottled, with thin bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, of medium size, russet, conspicuous; stem one-half\r\n    inch long, glabrous, parting easily from the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tough, bitterish, separating readily; flesh yellow, very juicy,\r\n    tender and melting, sweet except next to the pit, pleasantly\r\n    aromatic; good; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, oval, somewhat compressed, pointed, rough, ridged\r\n    along the ventral suture; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGEN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kraft _Pom.

To begin\r\nwith, it has a high percentage of sugars and solids so that the plum\r\ncures readily into a firm, sweet, long-keeping prune which in cooking\r\nneeds comparatively little sugar; again, the trees bear regularly,\r\nabundantly and the plums are uniform in size,—productiveness, regular\r\nbearing and uniformity of size of fruit being necessary attributes of a\r\ngood prune-making plum; lastly, it hangs well on the tree as it ripens\r\nand afterwards so that the curing really begins on the tree. Besides\r\nmaking most excellent prunes, the Agen is a very good dessert plum—one\r\nof the best—and ought to be in every home orchard and, where it attains\r\nsufficient size, in every commercial plantation. Lack of size is the\r\ndefect in this variety which has kept it from being more largely grown\r\noutside of prune-making regions. If by pruning, thinning and other\r\ncultural treatment the size of the plums could be increased, the Agen\r\nshould prove a valuable commercial fruit in New York.\r\n\r\nThe name of this variety is derived from Agen, a region in France where\r\nit is extensively grown. Tradition says that on their return from the\r\nCrusades, the Benedictine monks brought with them from Turkey or Persia\r\nwhat was then known as the Date plum and planted it in the garden of\r\ntheir abbey on the River Lot, in the vicinity of Bordeaux, France, and\r\nthat afterwards this became the Agen. Its first recorded importation into\r\nthe United States was made in 1854 by the United States Patent Office,\r\nthough it was described by Prince as early as 1832. The most important\r\nintroduction was made, however, in 1856, when Louis Pellier of San Jose,\r\nCalifornia, introduced Agen on the Pacific Coast, where it soon became\r\nand still is the leading plum, though with curious persistency the\r\nfruit-growers there call it the “French Prune” and the “Petite Prune.”\r\nIn 1862 this variety was added to the fruit catalog list of the American\r\nPomological Society. There are many strains of Agen in America, due to\r\nthe numerous importations of grafts from various parts of France, where\r\nthe plum orchards are frequently grown from seedlings or from sprouts;\r\nsome of these strains are worthy of varietal recognition.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    very productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with numerous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels; branchlets slender, short, with short\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to dark brownish-drab, dull,\r\n    pubescent, with small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and\r\n    length, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, one and three-quarters\r\n    inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long, velvety; upper\r\n    surface with few fine hairs and a narrow, grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, thickly pubescent; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed, base acute, margin doubly serrate; petiole one inch\r\n    long, slender, pubescent, tinged red, with two or three small,\r\n    globose, greenish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    white; borne on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    five-eighths inch long, thick, glabrous except for a few short\r\n    hairs, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent;\r\n    calyx-lobes obtuse, somewhat pubescent within, with glandular\r\n    margin, reflexed; petals broadly oval or obovate, entire,\r\n    tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and one-half inches by one\r\n    and one-eighth inches in size, obovate, the base necked,\r\n    halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring; suture very\r\n    shallow, indistinct; apex roundish or flattened; color\r\n    reddish or violet-purple, overspread with thin bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, brown, obscure, clustered about the apex and\r\n    interspersed between russet flecks; stem thick, seven-eighths\r\n    inch long, glabrous, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tough; flesh greenish-yellow, tender, sweet, aromatic; very\r\n    good to best; stone semi-free or free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, oval, flattened, with pitted surfaces,\r\n    rather abrupt at the base and apex; ventral suture somewhat\r\n    narrow, furrowed, with distinct wing; dorsal suture widely\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAITKIN\r\n\r\n_Prunus nigra_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Minn.

Itasca 1 incor.\r\n\r\nAitkin is very favorably mentioned in the references given above and\r\nundoubtedly has value for the Northwest. It was listed in the catalog of\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1899. The variety was found growing\r\nwild in Aitkin County, Minnesota, by D. C. Hazelton on land adjoining\r\nhis farm. It seemed to possess merit and was introduced in 1896 by\r\nthe Jewell Nursery Company of Lake City, Minnesota. Because of having\r\noriginated near Itasca Lake, it has been confused with the Itasca plum,\r\nwhich preceded it by nearly ten years. The following description is a\r\ncompilation:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, productive, ripening its wood very early;\r\n    fruit earliest in season of its group; large for its class,\r\n    oval, deep red, with no bloom; skin thin, not astringent;\r\n    flesh yellow, juicy, sweet and rich; good; stone large, oval,\r\n    flattened, clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nALHAMBRA\r\n\r\n[_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus cerasifera_ × _Prunus domestica_] ×\r\n[(_Prunus simonii_ × _Prunus triflora_) × (_Prunus americana_ × _Prunus\r\nnigra_)]\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Vt.

It is not often that we can trace the pedigree\r\nof a plant for more than one or at the most two generations, but in\r\nAlhambra we are particularly fortunate. Luther Burbank, the originator,\r\nbegan by crossing Kelsey and Pissardi, and the offspring from this cross\r\nwas fertilized with Agen pollen. This tri-hybrid was in turn fertilized\r\nwith pollen from a complex hybrid of a cross of _Prunus simonii_ and\r\n_Prunus triflora_ pollinated by a cross of _Prunus americana_ and _Prunus\r\nnigra_. As might be expected, the offspring of this final cross was\r\nextremely variable and from it was selected the Alhambra. The variety was\r\nnamed by the originator in 1898.\r\n\r\n    The fruit as described by Waugh is “egg-shaped, large or\r\n    very large; cavity medium shallow, abruptly rounded; suture\r\n    shallow; apex pointed; color dark, dull red; dots many, small,\r\n    yellowish; bloom thin, purplish; skin firm; flesh yellow\r\n    inside, reddish outside; stone medium to large, flat, pointed,\r\n    nearly smooth, clinging; flavor brisk subacid; quality first\r\n    rate.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHAM\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Jour.

The color is a\r\ntrifle too dull for market purposes and yet it is better colored than\r\nMcLaughlin, which sells fairly well. The fruit is the type of the last\r\nnamed plum but is later. In Europe this variety is well known and\r\nhighly esteemed for its quality, but unfortunately it is almost unknown\r\nin America. The variety is well worth trial in this country as a fine\r\nplum of the Reine Claude group. Altham is a seedling of Reine Claude,\r\nraised by Herr Prochaska, gardener to Count Michael Joseph Althann,\r\nof Swoyschitz, in Bohemia. It was noted in the _English Journal of\r\nHorticulture_ for 1869 as a new plum sent out by Thomas Rivers.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    productive; leaf-scars prominent; leaves folded upward,\r\n    obovate, two and one-quarter inches wide, nearly four inches\r\n    long, very thick, leathery; margin doubly crenate, with few,\r\n    small, dark glands; petiole thick, with from one to four\r\n    globose, yellowish-green glands on the stalk; season of bloom\r\n    intermediate, short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    inch across, yellowish at the apex of the petals; borne on\r\n    lateral buds and spurs, singly or in twos.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-half inches by one and\r\n    five-eighths inches in size, oblate, strongly truncate at\r\n    the base, compressed; color dark purplish-red over a yellow\r\n    ground, covered with thick bloom; dots russet surrounded with\r\n    a dark red ring; stem adhering strongly to the pulp; flesh\r\n    light golden-yellow, firm but tender, sweet, mild, pleasant;\r\n    very good to best; stone semi-clinging, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, flattened, irregular-oval, with\r\n    pitted surfaces, contracted at the base into a short oblique\r\n    neck; ventral suture prominent, heavily furrowed, often with\r\n    distinct wing; dorsal suture wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICA]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_ × _Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 3. 1898 =2.= _Vt.

The trees are large,\r\nvery vigorous, as hardy as either of its parents or possibly more so,\r\nand enormously productive. The qualities of fruit and tree are such that\r\nthe variety ought to succeed in commercial plantations where any but the\r\nhardiest native plums are cultivated. America is almost phenomenally free\r\nfrom rot, considering its parentage.\r\n\r\nThis variety is one of Luther Burbank’s productions, grown from a seed of\r\nRobinson fertilized by pollen from Abundance. It was introduced by the\r\noriginator in 1898 and has been since that time well tested at several\r\nplaces in the eastern states and is very generally well spoken of for a\r\nplum of its kind for the East.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, somewhat open-topped, hardy,\r\n    very productive; branches roughish and with cracked bark,\r\n    slightly zigzag, dark ash-gray, with numerous, conspicuously\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets willowy, long, with short\r\n    internodes, green with a reddish tinge changing to dark\r\n    chestnut-red, glossy, glabrous, with numerous, small, raised\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, broadly lanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, three and one-fourth inches long, thin;\r\n    upper surface reddish late in season, smooth and glossy, with\r\n    deeply grooved midrib; lower surface light green, sparingly\r\n    pubescent along the midrib and larger veins which are more or\r\n    less red; apex taper-pointed, base abrupt, margin finely and\r\n    doubly crenate and with numerous, small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    one-half inch long, tinged red, pubescent along one side,\r\n    glandless or with one or two small globose, reddish glands on\r\n    the upper part of the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate and long; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one-half inch across, white; borne in clusters\r\n    on short lateral spurs and buds, in pairs or in threes;\r\n    pedicels five-sixteenths inch long, slender, pubescent, green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse,\r\n    with a trace of red along the margin, glandular-serrate,\r\n    glabrous, with marginal hairs, erect; petals small, roundish,\r\n    entire, tapering abruptly to narrow claws; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments three-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season of medium length; one and three-eighths\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish-oval, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, flaring; suture shallow, a distinct line; apex\r\n    roundish; color clear, dark, currant-red over golden-yellow,\r\n    mottled, with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, whitish,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem slender, one-half inch long, glabrous,\r\n    adhering to the fruit; skin thin, bitterish, separating readily\r\n    from the pulp; flesh yellow, juicy, fibrous, somewhat tender,\r\n    sweet, not high in flavor; fair in quality; stone clinging,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval, pointed,\r\n    with pitted surfaces, broadly ridged along the ventral suture;\r\n    dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Oregon Sta.

It has never been extensively\r\ndisseminated, but seems to be a variety of considerable promise. The\r\nfruit as grown on the Station grounds resembles Hand rather closely; is\r\nlarge for a plum of its type, is a handsome golden color, is high in\r\nquality and will probably keep and ship well. Too little is known of its\r\ntree-characters to recommend it unqualifiedly.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, round-topped, dense,\r\n    productive; branches numerous; branchlets thick, marked\r\n    by grayish scarf-skin; leaves flattened, oval or obovate,\r\n    two and one-quarter inches wide, four and one-half inches\r\n    long, dark green; margin serrate or crenate; blooming season\r\n    intermediate, short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    and three-eighths inches across, singly or in twos, fragrant.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; very large, roundish-oblate, truncate,\r\n    golden-yellow, indistinctly streaked with green, mottled,\r\n    covered with thin bloom; flesh light golden-yellow, tender,\r\n    sweet, pleasant flavor; good to very good; stone clinging, one\r\n    inch by three-quarters inch in size, broadly oval, flattened,\r\n    surfaces pitted; dorsal suture wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN EAGLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cornell Sta.

Though supposed to be a cross between _Prunus\r\namericana_ and _Prunus triflora_, the variety shows few, if any, traces\r\nof the Triflora parentage, except, possibly in the shape and color of\r\nthe fruit. The variety is distinguished from other Americana plums by\r\nreddish dots on the fruit instead of the yellowish dots commonly found\r\non the plums of this species. The fruit of Ames is very attractive in\r\ncolor, the quality is fair, it keeps and ships well and it is fairly free\r\nfrom rot, characters which make it desirable where the native plums are\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nThis variety was produced by Professor J. L. Budd[204] of Ames, Iowa,\r\nby crossing De Soto with pollen of a “large Japanese plum received from\r\nOregon.” For a long while it was known as De Soto × Oregon No. 3 and as\r\nJapan Hybrid No. 3, but was named Ames by Professor John Craig, now of\r\nCornell University.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches roughish, thorny, the trunk shaggy, dark\r\n    ash-brown, with numerous, large, raised lenticels; branchlets\r\n    willowy, thick, long, with long internodes, green changing\r\n    to dark chestnut-red, glossy, glabrous, thickly strewn with\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, flattened, oval, two inches wide,\r\n    four inches long; upper surface dark green, glabrous,\r\n    slightly rugose; lower surface light green, pubescent; apex\r\n    taper-pointed, base abrupt, margin coarsely serrate, the\r\n    serrations ending in hair-like tips, eglandular; petiole\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, slender, pubescent, tinged red,\r\n    glandless or with from one to three globose, greenish-red\r\n    glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium in time and length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, nearly one inch across, white; borne in\r\n    clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in threes or fours;\r\n    pedicels one-half inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow,\r\n    somewhat acute, reflexed, pubescent on the inner surface,\r\n    the margin faintly pubescent and with a trace of red; petals\r\n    small, oval, somewhat dentate, tapering below to long,\r\n    narrow, slightly hairy claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length, frequently defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, one and seven-sixteenths inches by one\r\n    and five sixteenths inches in size, ovate or oval, sides\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring;\r\n    suture a line; apex roundish; color light to dark red over a\r\n    yellow ground, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    brownish-red; stem slender, glabrous; skin medium in thickness\r\n    and toughness, adhering; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, coarse,\r\n    fibrous, tender and melting, semi-sweet; of fair quality;\r\n    stone nearly free, one inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    irregular-oval, flattened and elongated at the base, abruptly\r\n    pointed at the apex, very smooth; ventral suture winged and\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ ×?\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 2. 1898. =2.= _Vt.

Even\r\nthe tree is marked with its robust growth, flat-topped head, peculiar,\r\nlight brown bark, handsome foliage and wood that can be propagated from\r\ncuttings with surprising ease. It is difficult to predict the future\r\nof this interesting plum, but probably it will remain for most part a\r\ncuriosity. Its peculiar flavor is not pleasant at first taste and it is\r\ndoubtful if many will learn to like it. Unpalatability is the defect of\r\nthe variety which will most often be counted against it. In general the\r\nApple is inferior for dessert or kitchen to the Satsuma, itself none\r\ntoo good, which it most nearly resembles of all plums. In the Station\r\ncollection tree and fruit are quite susceptible to both fungus and insect\r\npests and the fruits ripen unevenly. The fruit of the variety keeps and\r\nships remarkably well and these qualities may be its saving grace, both\r\nso well developed as to make it valuable for breeding purposes when these\r\ncharacters are desired.\r\n\r\nIn his catalog for 1898 Burbank announces the Apple as a new plum and\r\nsays, “Among the welcome surprises found three years ago among a lot of\r\nsome twenty-five thousand plum seedlings was this one, bearing a cruel\r\nload of enormous plums when only two years old.... It was at once named\r\nApple from the very close resemblance in form, color general appearance,\r\nand rare keeping qualities.... Its parentage is not known, except that\r\nit is a second generation seedling from cross-bred seedlings, and no\r\ndoubt Satsuma and probably Robinson are in its line of ancestry.” Satsuma\r\ncharacters are readily detected in tree and fruit and especially its\r\nhard, red flesh, but in no way is its descent from Robinson apparent.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, flat-topped, spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    slow-growing, semi-hardy, productive; branches rough and\r\n    thorny, with numerous fruit-spurs, dark ash-gray, reddish and\r\n    with numerous lenticels; branchlets often with a rosette of\r\n    flower-buds on the apex of the shoots, slender, with short\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to dark brown, glossy,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous, conspicuous, large, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oblanceolate, one and\r\n    one-quarter inches wide, three and three-quarters inches\r\n    long, thin, leathery; upper surface purplish-red late in the\r\n    season, glossy, glabrous, with grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    light green, pubescent at the base of the veins; apex acutely\r\n    pointed, base cuneate, margin finely and doubly crenate and\r\n    with small amber glands; petiole five-eighths inch long,\r\n    pubescent, red along one side, with from three to ten large,\r\n    conspicuous, reniform, red or yellowish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    before the leaves, white; borne in clusters on lateral buds\r\n    and spurs, in threes or fours; pedicels medium in length and\r\n    thickness, glabrous; calyx-tube obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, obtuse, glandular-ciliate, glabrous, erect; petals\r\n    oval, entire, short-clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments of\r\n    medium length; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens, often\r\n    defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-half inches long, one and\r\n    three-quarters inches wide, roundish-oblate, compressed,\r\n    halves equal; cavity medium in depth and width, flaring,\r\n    with concentric russet rings; suture shallow; apex depressed\r\n    and at one side; color dull dark red, with waxy bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, large, russet, conspicuous, clustered about the apex;\r\n    stem five-eighths inch long, glabrous; skin tough, bitterish,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh dark red, juicy, firm but\r\n    tender, sweet, with pleasant mild flavor, aromatic; good; stone\r\n    clinging, three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    oval or obovate, turgid, pointed, roughish, winged on the\r\n    ventral, deeply furrowed on the dorsal suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRICOT\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

However, as\r\nthe variety is nearly extinct, and will probably never be revived, this\r\nconfusion is happily of historic rather than of economic interest. Nearly\r\nall writers recognize at least two types, one of which is superior to the\r\nother. The better of these can readily be identified as the “Abricotée”\r\nof Duhamel, and should be considered the true Apricot. Little is known of\r\nthe early history of this variety other than that it was very generally\r\ndistributed throughout Europe early in the Seventeenth Century. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society rejected Apricot in 1858, though it is\r\ndoubtful if they had the true type. This variety is not to be confused\r\nwith the _Prunus simonii_, commonly called “Apricot,” or the native plum\r\nof that name.\r\n\r\n    The following description is compiled: tree large, vigorous,\r\n    productive; fruit mid-season; large, roundish or slightly\r\n    elongated, with prominent suture, yellow, blushed with red,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; flesh yellow, sweet, pleasant,\r\n    slightly musky; good; stone small, free.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCH DUKE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCH DUKE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 684. 1884. =2.= _Ont.

The qualities which fit it for a high place among commercial\r\nvarieties are: large size, handsome color—a rich, dark purple with thick\r\nbloom—and firmness of flesh and skin so that it both keeps and ships\r\nwell. The accompanying color-plate does not do the variety justice,\r\neither in beauty, color or size of fruit. Arch Duke compared with Grand\r\nDuke, known by all plum-growers, is nearly as large, neck thicker, the\r\nsame color, bloom heavier, quality higher, flesh firmer, stone free and\r\nripens earlier. The tree-characters, like the fruit-characters, are\r\nall good. While this variety is suitable for both home and market use\r\nit appears after a thorough test in many parts of the State for nearly\r\ntwenty years to be especially well adapted for a market fruit.\r\n\r\nArch Duke was raised by Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, from seed\r\nof De Montfort, and was sent out in 1883. It was first noted in America\r\nby the Ontario Fruit Growers’ Association in 1891 and was imported into\r\nthe United States by S. D. Willard[205] of Geneva, New York, about 1892.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, hardy in New York\r\n    except in exposed locations, very productive; branches smooth,\r\n    dark ash-gray, with small, raised lenticels; branchlets of\r\n    medium thickness and length, with long internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to brownish-red, glossy, covered thinly with bloom\r\n    and with sparse pubescence; lenticels numerous, very small,\r\n    obscure; leaf-buds large, long, pointed, free; leaf-scars\r\n    swollen.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval or obovate, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three and five-eighths inches long, thickish,\r\n    stiff; upper surface dark green, glossy, glabrous, with grooved\r\n    midrib; lower surface silvery-green, sparingly pubescent; apex\r\n    and base acute, margin doubly serrate, with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole three-quarters inch long, pubescent along one side,\r\n    tinged red, usually with two large, globose, greenish-yellow\r\n    glands on the stalk or on the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    in the bud creamy-yellow changing to white when expanded; borne\r\n    in scattering clusters on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch long, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate and with marginal\r\n    hairs, slightly reflexed; petals obovate or oval, crenate, with\r\n    short, broad claws; anthers yellowish, with a trace of pink;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season very short; one and three-quarters inches\r\n    by one and three-eighths inches in size, long-oval, slightly\r\n    compressed and necked; cavity shallow, narrow, compressed,\r\n    abrupt; suture shallow and rather broad, prominent; apex\r\n    elongated; color reddish-purple changing to dark blue at full\r\n    maturity, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    brownish-russet, inconspicuous; stem often inserted at one side\r\n    of the base, five-eighths inch long, glabrous, adhering well to\r\n    the fruit; skin tough, adhering; flesh deep golden-yellow often\r\n    a little reddish, juicy, coarse, firm, but somewhat tender,\r\n    sweet, pleasant and sprightly; good; stone free, the cavity\r\n    larger than the pit, one and one-eighth inches by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, long-oval, necked, abruptly tipped at the apex,\r\n    often reddish, rough; ventral suture broad, blunt, slightly\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture with an indistinct shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTIC\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCTIC]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

On the grounds of this Station it is\r\nboth hardy and productive and from its behavior here it might well be\r\nrecommended for these qualities, but as to its hardiness elsewhere\r\npomologists do not agree. In the references given above, Downing says it\r\nis the hardiest plum known; in Michigan it is reported very tender in the\r\nnursery row; a Canadian writer says it is not hardy enough for Canada;\r\nand it is reputed in the prairie states to be not hardier than Lombard.\r\nThe place of its origin, where few plums are grown, and the fact that it\r\nis one of but few that can be grown in parts of Canada and New Brunswick\r\nestablish the claim that it is one of the hardiest of the Domesticas,\r\npossibly not more so, however, than Lombard, Voronesh and a few others.\r\nThe small size and mediocre quality of the fruit and the dwarfish trees\r\nshould rule Arctic out where less hardy varieties can be grown.\r\n\r\nThis variety was first noted in 1881 by Downing who says it originated\r\non the grounds of A. T. Moore, Ashland, Maine, about forty miles\r\nnorth of Bangor. The parentage of Arctic is unknown. According to the\r\noriginator, it was grown from a seed of a medium sized blue plum bought\r\nat a fruit-stand in Boston. In 1881 Arctic was added to the American\r\nPomological Society catalog, where it still remains.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, of medium vigor, upright-spreading, very hardy,\r\n    productive, an early bearer, subject to attacks of fungi;\r\n    branches somewhat rough, dark ash-gray, with small lenticels;\r\n    branchlets strongly inclined to develop spurs and blossom-buds,\r\n    short, slender, with short internodes, greenish-red changing\r\n    to dark brownish-drab, dull, sparingly pubescent, with\r\n    inconspicuous, raised lenticels; leaf-buds short, obtuse,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves obovate or oval, two inches wide, three and\r\n    three-eighths inches long; upper surface dark green, covered\r\n    with numerous hairs, the midrib grooved; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base\r\n    acute, margin finely serrate, with small, black glands; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, tinged red, pubescent, with from one to\r\n    four globose, green glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season of medium length; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one and three-sixteenths inches across, in the\r\n    bud creamy-yellow changing to white as the petals expand;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch long, pubescent, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes narrow,\r\n    obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces, serrate, with ciliate\r\n    margins, reflexed; petals narrow-obovate or oval, crenate,\r\n    short-clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments one-half inch long;\r\n    pistil pubescent at the base, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and three-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-quarter inches in size, oval or ovate,\r\n    slightly swollen on the suture side, compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity very shallow and narrow, abrupt; suture shallow,\r\n    indistinct; apex roundish; color dark purple becoming\r\n    purplish-black at full maturity, covered with thick bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous, clustered about\r\n    the apex; stem slender, seven-eighths inch long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering to the fruit; skin of medium thickness and toughness,\r\n    separating readily; flesh light yellow, juicy, coarse and\r\n    fibrous, somewhat firm but tender, sweetish, mild; fair\r\n    in quality; stone nearly free, characteristically small,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval, flattened at\r\n    the apex, acute at the base, rough and pitted; ventral suture\r\n    ridged, faintly winged; dorsal suture broadly and shallowly\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nARKANSAS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARKANSAS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

On the grounds of\r\nthis Station, Arkansas is one of the most valuable plums of its species,\r\nbeing unusually attractive in size, color and shape and one of the best\r\nin quality of its kind. Its chief fault is a lack of robustness in the\r\ntree. While it would not prove profitable as a market plum in New York,\r\nit could be well planted in a commercial orchard in regions where native\r\nplums must be grown, and in New York it would at least add a pleasing\r\nvariety to any collection of plums. This variety was brought to notice by\r\nT. V. Munson in 1881. It originated in Arkansas and was introduced by J.\r\nD. Morrow & Sons of that state.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, flattened, spreading, dense-topped, symmetrical,\r\n    hardy, productive, somewhat subject to shot-hole fungus;\r\n    trunk shaggy; branches rough, zigzag, sparingly thorny, dark\r\n    ash-gray, with numerous lenticels; branchlets slender, with\r\n    very short internodes, greenish-red changing to reddish-brown,\r\n    glossy, glabrous, with few, conspicuous, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, lanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    one-quarter inches wide, three and one-half inches long, thin;\r\n    upper surface light green, smooth, glabrous, with grooved\r\n    midrib; lower surface pale green, sparingly pubescent along the\r\n    midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base acute, margin\r\n    finely serrate, with light brown glands; petiole one-half inch\r\n    long, slender, pubescent on one side, dull red, with from one\r\n    to six small, globose, yellow or brownish-red glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, five-eighths inch across, in the buds creamy-yellow\r\n    changing to white as they unfold; with a strong disagreeable\r\n    odor; borne in very dense clusters on lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    in threes or fours; pedicels one-half inch long, slender,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes short, sparingly pubescent on the inner surface,\r\n    glandular-serrate, faintly hairy and with a trace of red on\r\n    the margin, erect; petals obovate, crenate, with narrow claws,\r\n    somewhat hairy at the base; anthers yellowish; filaments nearly\r\n    one-quarter inch in length; pistil glabrous, slightly shorter\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season very long; one inch by seven-eighths inch\r\n    in size, roundish-ovate, halves slightly unequal; cavity\r\n    shallow, flaring, regular; suture an indistinct line; apex\r\n    roundish or pointed; color bright currant-red, with thin\r\n    bloom; dots smallish, white, conspicuous, clustered about the\r\n    apex; stem very slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous, not\r\n    adhering to the fruit; skin thin, tough, bitter, separating\r\n    readily; flesh orange-yellow, juicy, fibrous, somewhat tender\r\n    and melting, sweet at the skin but sour at the center,\r\n    aromatic; good; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, oval, flattened and prolonged at the base,\r\n    sharp-tipped at the apex; ventral suture acute, faintly ridged;\r\n    dorsal suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN COMPOTE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTUMN COMPOTE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= McIntosh _Bk.

Compote d’Automne 5.\r\n\r\nThis plum is well and favorably known in England, but it is scarcely\r\ngrown in America, though it has much in the character of its fruit at\r\nleast to recommend it. The plums are attractive in appearance and while\r\nnot of the highest flavor are yet far above the average in the qualities\r\nwhich make a good dessert fruit, while for culinary purposes it ranks\r\namong the best. The trees are productive, hardy and fairly vigorous and\r\nmay be especially noted as holding their crop well. Autumn Compote is a\r\nseedling of Cooper, raised by Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England,\r\nabout 1840.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, spreading, rather low and\r\n    open-topped, hardy, very productive; branches smooth, dark\r\n    brownish-gray, with lenticels intermediate in number and size;\r\n    branchlets few, slender, very short, with long internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to dark brownish-red, dull, sparingly\r\n    pubescent early in the season, becoming heavily pubescent\r\n    later, with few, inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    long, pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves drooping, folded backward, long-oval or obovate, two and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, four and one-fourth inches long, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth, hairy, with deeply grooved\r\n    midrib; lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex acute, base\r\n    tapering, margin crenate, eglandular; petiole thick, one-half\r\n    inch long, tinged red, glandless or with from one to four\r\n    globose, greenish-yellow, large glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one and one-quarter inches across, in the\r\n    buds creamy-yellow changing to white as the flowers open;\r\n    borne in clusters on short lateral spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels nearly one-half inch long, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, glandular-serrate, sparingly pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, reflexed; petals oval, narrowly dentate, with very\r\n    short and broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments nearly\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripening period of medium length; one and\r\n    five-eighths inches by one and three-eighths inches in size,\r\n    oval or slightly ovate, halves unequal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    abrupt; suture shallow, a distinct line; apex roundish or\r\n    slightly pointed; color purplish-red over a yellow ground,\r\n    covered with bloom of medium thickness; dots numerous,\r\n    small, light russet, conspicuous; stem glabrous, adhering\r\n    to the fruit; skin thin, tender, separating readily; flesh\r\n    golden-yellow, dry, firm but tender, sweet, not high in flavor;\r\n    fair in quality; stone clinging but not tenaciously, one inch\r\n    by five-eighths inch in size, irregularly and broadly ovate,\r\n    flattened, roughish, slightly compressed and necked at the\r\n    base, blunt or acute at the apex; ventral suture narrow,\r\n    winged, strongly furrowed; dorsal suture acute or faintly\r\n    furrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTLETT\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus simonii_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

The originator\r\ndisposed of the variety in 1899 and it immediately became popular with\r\nnurserymen and was soon offered for sale in all parts of the United\r\nStates. Fruit-growers have not received it so well, however, and most\r\nof those who have tried it have discarded it or hold the variety as a\r\ncuriosity. The fruit is attractive in appearance and the Bartlett pear\r\nflavor is agreeable, but the skin cracks badly in this State and the\r\nflesh is too soft for shipping. The tree with its stiff, upright branches\r\nresembles a Lombardy poplar and with its bright, glossy green foliage is\r\nan attractive ornamental. It is still further peculiar in bearing thick\r\nclusters of flowers at the ends of lateral spurs.\r\n\r\n    Tree lacking in size and vigor, upright, open-topped, not very\r\n    hardy, productive; branches rough, with numerous fruit-spurs;\r\n    branchlets slender, short, glabrous throughout the season;\r\n    leaf-buds plump; leaves folded upward, oblanceolate, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long, thin;\r\n    margin finely serrate, in two series, eglandular or with small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole slender, with from one to four small\r\n    glands; blooming season early, long; flowers appearing before\r\n    the leaves.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early; one and three-eighths inches by one and\r\n    one-quarter inches in size, long-cordate to slightly oval,\r\n    dark purplish-red over yellow, covered with thick bloom;\r\n    skin tender, bitter; flesh yellow, not very juicy, tender,\r\n    sweet, with a peculiar but pleasant flavor; of good quality;\r\n    stone clinging, seven-eighths inch by one-half inch in size,\r\n    elongated-ovate, narrow, blunt at the base, long drawn out at\r\n    the apex, the surfaces rough.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASSETT\r\n\r\n_Prunus maritima_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

F. Bassett of Hamilton, New Jersey, who introduced it\r\nin 1872. After its introduction it became somewhat popular in the West,\r\ngaining quite a reputation as being “curculio proof,” However, its marked\r\ninferiority to varieties of other species, in both size and quality, has\r\nnow banished it from all commercial plantings. The following description\r\nis compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, spreading.

It is\r\nunexcelled as a dessert plum and its delicious flavor is retained in\r\ncooking, making the somewhat rare combination of a first rate dessert\r\nand a first rate culinary fruit. Bavay is not only satisfactory in the\r\nqualities which make it desirable to the consumer but it is a good\r\nmarket plum for it both keeps and ships well. The flavor is not quite\r\nequal to that of Reine Claude, one of the best of all plums in quality,\r\nbut in tree-characters the Bavay surpasses the older variety. The trees\r\nbear young, annually and heavily, sometimes too heavily, and while not\r\nas hardy, as large, as robust or as long-lived as could be wished, yet\r\nin these respects they are superior to those of most of the varieties\r\nof Reine Claude plums. Some horticulturists recommend that the Bavay\r\nbe top-worked on a more vigorous, hardy and longer-lived stock but the\r\nbehavior of trees so treated in this vicinity makes top-working a very\r\ndoubtful expedient. Lombard is usually recommended as a stock upon\r\nwhich to work it. Bavay is indispensable in home orchards and can be\r\nrecommended for much more general planting in commercial orchards.\r\n\r\nThis variety is a seedling of Reine Claude produced by Major Esperin of\r\nMalines, Belgium, about 1832, and dedicated by him in 1843, to M. De\r\nBavay, Director of the Royal Nurseries, at Vilvordes, near Brussels.\r\nThough this variety is distinct from its parent in tree-characters, in\r\nhaving a later season, smaller fruit and a different flavor, the two\r\nplums have become confused by many nurserymen and horticulturists. In\r\n1856, the American Pomological Society placed Bavay on its fruit catalog\r\nlist where it still remains.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    hardy, very productive, somewhat susceptible to sunscald;\r\n    branches smooth except for the few, large, raised lenticels,\r\n    light ash-gray; branchlets medium in thickness and length, with\r\n    internodes of variable length, dull brownish-red, pubescent,\r\n    with numerous, inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds large,\r\n    long, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, oval, or slightly obovate, wide, long,\r\n    thick; upper surface nearly smooth, covered sparsely with\r\n    hairs; lower surface thickly pubescent, especially along the\r\n    midrib and larger veins; apex acute; margin crenate, glandless;\r\n    petiole thick, long, tinged lightly with red, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three globose, greenish-yellow glands on the stalk\r\n    or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    whitish or creamy at the apex of the petals; borne on lateral\r\n    buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels three-eighths inch\r\n    long, pubescent, green; calyx-tube greenish, obconic, pubescent\r\n    at the base; calyx-lobes rather broad, obtuse, pubescent on\r\n    both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals broadly\r\n    obovate, crenate, tapering below to short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil pubescent\r\n    on the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; of medium size, roundish-oval, halves\r\n    equal; cavity intermediate in depth and width, abrupt; suture\r\n    a line; apex roundish; color greenish-yellow changing to dark\r\n    straw-yellow, obscurely streaked and splashed, covered with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, small, grayish, obscure, clustered\r\n    about the apex; stem thick, short, pubescent, adhering well\r\n    to the fruit; skin rather tough, separating readily; flesh\r\n    rich golden-yellow, juicy, slightly fibrous, tender, sweet,\r\n    pleasant flavor; very good; stone free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, oval, slightly necked, blunt at\r\n    the apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture winged, deeply\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEJONNIERES\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Concerning the\r\norigin of the variety, nothing is known although it is generally believed\r\nto have originated in Belgium prior to 1850.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round and dense-topped, not always\r\n    hardy, very productive; branchlets numerous, thick, pubescent\r\n    throughout the season; leaf-scars prominent; leaves flattened\r\n    or folded upward, oval, one and five-eighths inches wide, three\r\n    and one-half inches long; margin serrate or crenate; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, glandless or with from one to two small\r\n    glands usually at the base of the leaf; flowers nearly one inch\r\n    across, white, with a peculiar greenish and creamy tinge near\r\n    the apex of the petals and often splashed with pink towards\r\n    the base; borne on lateral buds and spurs; calyx-tube thickly\r\n    pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; medium to below in size, roundish-oval,\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; flesh rich,\r\n    golden-yellow, medium juicy, firm, sweet, mild; fair to good;\r\n    stone nearly free, of medium size, oval, flattened, often with\r\n    a distinct wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELLE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =10=:71. 1855. =2.= Downing _Fr.

It is much like Pond but is brighter red, a little\r\nsmaller, less necked, the stem is shorter, the apex more blunt and it\r\nis more of a clingstone. European authorities say that Belle is second\r\nto none for culinary purposes and its handsome appearance gives it\r\nvalue across the seas as a dessert plum. As Belle grows on the grounds\r\nof this Station—it seems not to be found elsewhere in New York—the\r\ntree-characters are quite above those in the average variety of plums and\r\nwhen considered with the fine, late fruits, indicate that the variety\r\nmight be grown with profit for market purposes. It well deserves to be\r\ntried by commercial plum-growers.\r\n\r\nBelle came from Brussels, Belgium, and was propagated by the famous\r\nhorticulturist, Van Mons. Nothing further is known of its origin.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, upright, open-topped,\r\n    hardy, productive; branches smooth, dull dark ash-gray, with\r\n    small, numerous, raised lenticels; branchlets thick, with short\r\n    internodes, green changing to brownish-red, often marked with\r\n    scarf-skin, dull, very pubescent early in the season becoming\r\n    less pubescent as maturity advances, with numerous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and length, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened or folded upward, obovate, one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches wide, four and one-half inches long,\r\n    thick, leathery; upper surface dark green, with deeply\r\n    grooved midrib, sparingly hairy; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    pubescent; apex acute, base cuneate, margin shallowly but\r\n    broadly crenate, with few small dark glands; petiole one and\r\n    one-eighth inches long, thick, pubescent, tinged with light\r\n    red, glandless or with one or two small, globose, yellowish\r\n    glands on the stalk or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, the buds cream-tipped\r\n    changing to white on expanding; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, usually singly; pedicels about seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, green; calyx-tube greenish,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous except towards the base; calyx-lobes\r\n    above medium in width, obtuse, slightly pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate, erect; petals broadly ovate,\r\n    crenate, with short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season of medium length; one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches by one and three-quarters inches in size, roundish-oval,\r\n    slightly compressed, halves nearly equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    flaring; suture shallow, rather wide, prominent; apex roundish\r\n    or depressed; color light purplish-red over a greenish-yellow\r\n    ground, overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    russet, inconspicuous; stem one-half inch long, thickly\r\n    pubescent, adhering strongly to the fruit, with fleshy ring\r\n    about the base; skin of average thickness and toughness, sour,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh pale yellow, juicy, coarse,\r\n    firm, sweet at the skin, but tart at the center, pleasant,\r\n    aromatic; good; stone clinging, one and three-sixteenths inches\r\n    by three-quarters inch in size, oval, turgid, blunt at the\r\n    apex, with rough and pitted surfaces; ventral suture winged,\r\n    with few but prominent ridges; dorsal suture widely and deeply\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERCKMANS\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Berckmans[206] of Augusta, Georgia, who had secured some\r\nBotan trees from Burbank, noted that this plum differed from the rest\r\nand, in order to distinguish it, named it Sweet Botan. The nomenclature\r\nof Botan was confused and indefinite and Bailey, in 1894, renamed the new\r\nplum Berckmans. As it is very similar to Abundance, still more confusion\r\nhas arisen in regard to it. Compared with Abundance, Berckmans is more\r\nspreading in growth; fruit less pointed, with dryer and more insipid\r\nflesh; color brighter red and the stone usually freer; but it is neither\r\nas productive nor as free from rot. In 1897 the American Pomological\r\nSociety placed the variety on its fruit list. As Berckmans is inferior\r\nto Abundance and ripens at the same season, it is not worth recommending\r\nfor general planting. It is to be regretted that so distinguished a\r\nhorticulturist as Mr. Berckmans is not to have his name perpetuated in a\r\nbetter plum than the one named in his honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERGER\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cornell Sta.

Its\r\npeculiarities are: A flavor quite distinct from that of any other\r\nTriflora plum; its cherry-like appearance; early ripening, maturing in\r\nthis State shortly after the middle of July; its pronounced upright habit\r\nof growth; its light green foliage; and its habit of bearing its fruit\r\nclose to the old wood. In common with many other Japanese varieties,\r\nthe nomenclature of Berger is badly confused. According to Bailey, who\r\nreceived specimens of this variety from various sections of the country,\r\nH. H. Berger & Company of San Francisco sent out this plum under several\r\nnames. Berckmans of Georgia received it as Red Nagate; N. S. Platt of\r\nConnecticut as Satsuma; to another person in the South it came as Shiro\r\nSmomo, while T. V. Munson of Texas grew it under the name of Berger,\r\na term finally adopted by Bailey. In the meanwhile, Stark Brothers of\r\nLouisiana, Missouri, introduced a plum very similar to this under the\r\nname Strawberry but the variety was dropped by them in 1893. Whether or\r\nnot this “Strawberry” or “Uchi-Beni,” as it was sometimes called, was\r\nreally the Berger it is impossible to say but it is certain that both of\r\nthese names have been applied to the Berger. The following description is\r\na compilation.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright, open-topped, medium hardy; leaves\r\n    narrow, light colored; blooming season early; flowers white,\r\n    small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early; unusually small, roundish but truncate at the\r\n    ends, attractive light to dark red, covered with thick bloom;\r\n    flesh firm, meaty, light yellow, sweet, of pleasant flavor;\r\n    fair to good; stone very small and cherry-like, free, with\r\n    smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK BULLACE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK BULLACE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

Bullesse 2. _Earley’s November_ 11.\r\n\r\nThis variety is interesting chiefly as an early type of the Insititia\r\nplums, its thorny branches, wayward growth, small and austere fruit,\r\nall bespeaking a wild fruit. The plums when ripened by frost are not\r\nunpleasant to taste and are borne in prodigious quantities. The variety,\r\nhowever, is surpassed by many other Insititias and has little value\r\nother than to show the steps between wild and highly cultivated fruits.\r\n\r\nBlack Bullace is one of the oldest of cultivated plums and all data in\r\nregard to its origin have been lost. It resembles the wild forms of\r\nits species very closely and it may have been selected from the wild.\r\nParkinson, writing in 1629, (References, 1) gives a short description of\r\nthis variety; and Gerard, in 1636, (References, 2) says: “The Bullesse\r\nand the Sloe tree are wilde kindes of Plums, which do vary in their\r\nkind, even as the greater and manured Plums do. Of Bullesse, some are of\r\ngreater and of better taste than others. Sloes are some of one taste, and\r\nsome of others, more sharp; some greater and others lesser; the which to\r\ndistinguish with long descriptions were to small purpose, considering\r\nthey be all and every of them known even to the simplest; therefore\r\nthis shall suffice for their several descriptions.” Black Bullace has\r\nlong been known in England and was among the first European varieties\r\ncultivated in this country. Deane in _The New England Farmer_, 1797,\r\ndescribes this variety briefly as under cultivation at that time but it\r\ndid not prove popular in North America and after Prince, 1832, it seems\r\nto have dropped from American plum literature.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright or slightly spreading,\r\n    dense-topped, hardy, very productive; branches smooth except\r\n    for the numerous, small, raised lenticels, dark, ash-gray;\r\n    branchlets long, with short internodes, green changing to dark\r\n    brownish-drab, thickly pubescent, with numerous, inconspicuous,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds small short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves oval, one and one-half inches wide, three and\r\n    one-quarter inches long; upper surface dark green, rugose,\r\n    hairy, with grooved midrib; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    heavily pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute,\r\n    margin serrate or crenate, with a few, smallish, dark glands;\r\n    petiole three-quarters inch long, green, thickly pubescent,\r\n    glandless or with one or two small, globose, greenish-brown\r\n    glands on the stalk or at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, white;\r\n    borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    three-eighths inch long, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, pubescent only at the base; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, obtuse, pubescent at margin and base, with few glands,\r\n    reflexed; petals oval, entire, tapering abruptly to short\r\n    claws; anthers yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch in\r\n    length; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; one and one-eighth inches by\r\n    seven-eighths inch in size, distinctly oval, necked, not\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity small, shallow, narrow,\r\n    flaring; suture lacking; apex roundish, with stigma usually\r\n    adhering; color purplish-black, covered with thick bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, small, brown, inconspicuous; stem one-half\r\n    inch long, pubescent, adhering to the fruit; skin of medium\r\n    thickness and toughness, slightly astringent, adhering\r\n    somewhat; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy and fibrous, firm,\r\n    sour or agreeably tart late in the season; stone clinging,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, irregularly oval\r\n    or ovate, slightly necked at the base, acute at the apex, with\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture swollen, blunt; dorsal suture\r\n    acute or partially furrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKMAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana_ × _Prunus persica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gara.

According to Bailey, a Mrs. Charity Clark secured plum pits from\r\nan orchard of Wild Goose and Washington plums in Rutherford County,\r\nTennessee, about 1865 and gave them to Dr. Blackman of Nashville of that\r\nState. One of the seedlings appeared promising and was disseminated\r\nby a local nurseryman under the name Blackman. A rival nurseryman in\r\nattempting to procure cions of this variety inadvertently cut them\r\nfrom an adjacent tree, a barren seedling from the same lot of seed.\r\nUnfortunately the spurious Blackman received a wide distribution while\r\nthe true variety remained practically unknown. Afterwards in order to\r\navoid confusion the original Blackman was rechristened Charity Clark\r\nunder which name it is now known. The tree of the second Blackman is\r\nstrong and vigorous but rarely produces its plum-like fruit. The foliage\r\nis about midway in character between the plum and peach; the fruit-buds\r\nare formed abundantly but seldom open. From a horticultural standpoint,\r\nthe variety is of course worthless but the hybrid, one of the first of\r\nits kind, is interesting and worth recording.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEKER\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

It is a delicious dessert plum of the Reine Claude group, much\r\nlike Yellow Gage but distinguished from it by a longer and stouter\r\nstalk. Its tree-characters in New York are good and the fruit in all the\r\nqualities that make plums desirable is as good as that of most of its\r\nclass. The variety originated with a Mrs. Bleeker of Albany, New York,\r\nabout 1810 from a pit given her by Rev. Mr. Dull of Kingston, New York.\r\nThis stone had come from Germany and was thought to have been that of\r\na German prune but this is probably an error as the seedlings of that\r\nvariety come true or nearly so. Bleeker was listed in the catalogs of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society from 1852 to 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk and branches thick and covered with rough\r\n    bark; branches slightly pubescent; leaves two and one-quarter\r\n    inches wide, four inches long, oval, stiff; upper surface\r\n    somewhat rugose; margin serrate; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, thick, tinged red, with from two to three glands usually\r\n    on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early; nearly one and one-half inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oval, greenish-yellow, striped and splashed with green\r\n    becoming golden-yellow at full maturity, overspread with thin\r\n    bloom; flesh golden-yellow, dry, coarse, firm, sweet, mild; of\r\n    good quality; stone semi-clinging, one inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, obovate, acute at the apex, medium turgid, with\r\n    pitted surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE PERDRIGON\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

Hakluyt, writing in 1582, says, “Of late time the\r\nPlum called the _Perdigevena_ was procured out of Italy, with two kinds\r\nmore, by the Lord Cromwell, after his travel.” Gough, in his _British\r\nTopography_, states that Lord Cromwell introduced the “Perdrigon plum”\r\ninto England in the time of Henry VII. From these accounts it would seem\r\nthat this plum was established in England some time during the latter\r\npart of the Fifteenth Century. For three hundred years it thrived so well\r\nin England that writers had no hesitation in pronouncing it their best\r\nplum. From England it came early to America. Probably it was included\r\nin the shipment of plum pits ordered from England by the Governor and\r\nCompany of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in New England in 1629. In spite\r\nof its Old World reputation, however, it never found favor here and is\r\nnow rarely if ever seen even in collections. The older writers mentioned\r\na Black Perdrigon which they considered distinct from the variety under\r\ndiscussion. Inasmuch as all plums until recently were propagated from\r\nseed, it is more than likely that there were all gradations in color\r\nand that some attempted to classify the darker seedlings as a distinct\r\nvariety. This hypothesis is borne out by the fact that after grafting\r\nand budding became the common method of propagation the so-called Black\r\nPerdrigon became extinct. The following description is a compilation.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, but not always productive; young shoots\r\n    pubescent; fruit mid-season; medium in size, obovate,\r\n    compressed on the suture side, purple or blue, with\r\n    thick bloom; stem slender; skin thick, very tough; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, firm, rich, sweet, aromatic; good; stone\r\n    small, flattened, clinging; fruit hangs on the tree until it\r\n    shrivels.\r\n\r\n\r\nBODDAERT\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

The plums are\r\nlarge, attractive and of very good quality. Since the variety has been\r\nknown so long it must be that the tree has some fatal defect; otherwise\r\nit would be more largely grown. Boddaert is probably a Reine Claude\r\nseedling and is of foreign origin, the details of its early history not\r\nbeing known. Downing, in 1876, first mentioned the variety in America;\r\nthe following year it was placed on the fruit list in the American\r\nPomological Society catalog.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, medium in vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk rough; branches smooth, except for a few,\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness, brash,\r\n    thinly pubescent; leaves oval, two and one-quarter inches\r\n    wide, four inches long, thick and leathery; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose; margin crenate, with small dark glands; petiole\r\n    pubescent, thick, tinged red, usually with two globose glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; about one and one-half inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-ovate, strongly compressed, yellow, mottled with green\r\n    before full maturity, overspread with thin bloom; stem thickly\r\n    pubescent; flesh light yellow, dry, meaty, tender, sweet; good\r\n    in quality; stone semi-free or free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, oval or ovate, turgid, with pitted\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADSHAW\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRADSHAW]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mag.

A study of the variety does not justify this popularity.\r\nThe trees grow rather slowly and are slow in coming into bearing; the\r\nfruit is not especially high in quality and in many regions is attacked\r\nby brown-rot too freely for profitable orchard culture. To offset these\r\nfaults the trees are large and well formed, bear regularly and heavily,\r\nare hardy, robust and healthy, the best of recommendations, and the plums\r\nare large, attractive in appearance and keep and ship well especially\r\nif picked a little green. The variety, curiously enough, is not nearly\r\nas badly attacked by San José scale as other plums. Probably one of\r\nthe reasons why Bradshaw is so largely grown in New York is that it is\r\neasily handled in the nursery and quickly makes a very good nursery tree.\r\nBradshaw does not deserve the high place it holds with plum-growers,\r\nand must give way sooner or later to better varieties for commercial\r\norchards. The value of the crop is greatly lessened in New York because\r\nit ripens in the midst of the peach season.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the origin of this plum is not known. The Europeans and\r\nsome Americans have held that it came from America but, since it is\r\nidentical with the Large Black Imperial, it must be of foreign origin. It\r\nwas named by C. M. Hovey in 1846, and was described in his _Magazine of\r\nHorticulture_ with the following explanation: “For the want of a name to\r\ndistinguish a very large and excellent plum, exhibited for three or four\r\nyears in succession, by E. E. Bradshaw, Esq., Charlestown, we have called\r\nit the Bradshaw plum.” Barry, in 1855, states in the _Horticulturist_\r\nthat he “received it from Wm. Kenrick, a nurseryman in Newton,\r\nMassachusetts, under the name of Large Black Imperial; but as it has been\r\ndescribed in _Hovey’s Magazine_ as Bradshaw, we have adopted that name in\r\nour catalog.” Though the name Bradshaw is incorrect according to the rule\r\nof priority, it would now cause too much confusion to change it.\r\n\r\nNiagara, a well known variety in this State, is identical with Bradshaw\r\nin all characters, in spite of a supposedly distinct origin. According\r\nto Mr. George Atwood of the State Department of Agriculture, a Mr. Moody\r\nof Lockport exhibited, about 1870, the Mooney plum, afterwards named the\r\nNiagara. Being interested in the variety, Mr. Atwood visited Mooney, at\r\nLockport, the man from whom Moody had secured his stock. In Mooney’s\r\nyard were found several bearing trees, which had been grown from sprouts\r\ntaken from the original seedling tree, grown in Canada. These trees could\r\nnot be told from the Bradshaw. If the Niagara is distinct as to origin,\r\nit is probably a seedling of Bradshaw. Bradshaw was recommended to\r\nfruit-growers as a promising variety by the American Pomological Society\r\nin 1856 and has since remained on the fruit list of the society.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, broad-vasiform, dense-topped, hardy, very\r\n    productive; branches smooth except for the numerous, small,\r\n    raised lenticels, dark ash-gray; branchlets short, with long\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-red, often with\r\n    heavy gray scarf-skin, dull, sparingly pubescent, with obscure,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds variable in size and length,\r\n    pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves drooping, folded backward, obovate or oval, two inches\r\n    wide, four and one-quarter inches long, thickish; upper surface\r\n    dark green, rugose, pubescent, with a shallow groove on the\r\n    midrib; lower surface grayish-green, thickly pubescent; apex\r\n    acute, base abrupt, margin not regular, varying from coarsely\r\n    crenate to serrate, eglandular or with few, small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole three-quarters inch long, pubescent, reddish, glandless\r\n    or with from one to three large, globose, greenish-brown glands\r\n    on the stalk or at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    and three-sixteenths inches across, the buds creamy changing\r\n    to white as the flowers expand; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels nearly eleven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, pubescent, green; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate,\r\n    pubescent only at the base; calyx-lobes wide, obtuse, pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, margins ciliate, reflexed;\r\n    petals broadly oval, erose, with short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; two inches by one and three-quarters\r\n    inches in size, oval or obovate, compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt, with a fleshy ring around\r\n    the stem; suture very shallow; apex roundish or flattened;\r\n    color light purplish-red changing to dark reddish-purple at\r\n    maturity, covered with thick bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    russet, inconspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem thick,\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, pubescent, adhering strongly to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, somewhat tough, sour, separating readily;\r\n    flesh dull yellow, often with a trace of red when fully\r\n    mature, juicy, fibrous, somewhat tender, sweet, pleasant;\r\n    good; stone semi-free, flattened, one and one-quarter inches\r\n    by three-quarters inch in size, irregularly oval, necked at\r\n    the base, blunt at the apex, strongly roughened and pitted,\r\n    often with numerous, small, deep pits near the margins of both\r\n    ventral and dorsal sutures; ventral suture strongly furrowed\r\n    and winged; dorsal suture with a deep, narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRYANSTON\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Reine-Claude\r\n    Bryanston 8.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of Bryanston fall not a little short, all things considered,\r\nof being as good as those of several other of the varieties in the Reine\r\nClaude group of which this plum is a member. For this reason Bryanston\r\nis not often rated by horticulturists as one of the best plums, but the\r\nlarge, vigorous trees growing on the Station grounds are so especially\r\ndesirable for this variety, in a group which taken as a whole is noted\r\nfor poor trees, that it is here described among the leading plums. The\r\nfruit is larger than that of Reine Claude but is less attractive in\r\ncolor and shape and the quality is not as high. It is later than the\r\nvariety with which it has just been compared and the crop is not borne\r\nas regularly. While this plum can hardly be recommended for extensive\r\norchard plantings, it yet has too many merits to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to be the result of crossing Reine Claude and Golden\r\nDrop at Bryanston Park, Blandford, England. It was first noted in the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society fruit catalog in 1831 but no information in\r\nregard to the date of its origin seems to have been published. In 1871\r\nthe American Pomological Society added it to its fruit catalog list but\r\ndropped it in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, round-topped, open, hardy, very\r\n    productive; branches smooth, becoming rough near the trunk,\r\n    ash-gray, with lenticels of medium size and number; branchlets\r\n    somewhat slender, short, with long internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dull reddish-brown, marked by scarf-skin, dull,\r\n    glabrous, with few, inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    above medium in size and length, pointed, free; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, oval or obovate, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long, leathery; upper\r\n    surface dark green, sparingly hairy, with a shallow groove on\r\n    the midrib; lower surface yellowish-green, pubescent; apex\r\n    abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin crenate, bearing\r\n    small, dark glands; petiole one-half inch long, pubescent, with\r\n    a little red, glandless or with one or two small, globose,\r\n    yellowish glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time, short; flowers appearing\r\n    with the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white,\r\n    creamy at the apex of the petals in the newly opened flowers;\r\n    borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    one-half inch long, thick, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, pubescent at the base; calyx-lobes broad,\r\n    obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-ciliate, somewhat\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-ovate, erose; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments about one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous except\r\n    at the base, slightly longer than the stamens; stigma large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and five-eighths inches by one and\r\n    one-half inches in size, irregular roundish-truncate, halves\r\n    unequal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture usually\r\n    shallow, prominent; apex flattened or depressed; color dull\r\n    yellow with greenish streaks, sometimes with pinkish blush\r\n    about the cavity, mottled, overspread with thin bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, inconspicuous; stem thick, three-quarters inch\r\n    long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tough,\r\n    sour, separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, firm\r\n    but tender, sweet, aromatic; very good; stone nearly free,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size, broadly oval,\r\n    turgid, slightly contracted at the blunt base, roundish at the\r\n    apex, with rough and pitted surfaces; ventral suture broad,\r\n    with a distinct but small wing; dorsal suture widely and deeply\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURBANK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURBANK]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Wassu 4.\r\n    _Wassu_ 9.\r\n\r\nProbably Abundance holds first place among the Triflora plums in New\r\nYork but Burbank is a close second and in many localities has first\r\npreference. Abundance is in the lead chiefly because the trees of this\r\nvariety are larger and better formed and bear more fruit than those of\r\nBurbank. To offset the advantages of Abundance the fruit of Burbank is of\r\nbetter quality, more handsomely colored, keeps and ships better and is\r\nless susceptible to brown-rot. The fruit of Burbank ripens a week or more\r\nlater than that of Abundance, which in most seasons is a slight advantage\r\nfor the first-named variety. The trees of this plum are distinguished\r\nfrom those of all other plums by their low, spreading habit, flat top\r\nand somewhat drooping branches, characters which make them more or less\r\ndifficult to handle in the orchard and very difficult to manage in the\r\nnursery. The wood of Burbank is brittle, true of all Trifloras, but\r\na serious defect in this one. In common with other varieties of its\r\nspecies, Burbank is less troubled with curculio and black-knot than the\r\nEuropean plums. The fruit of this variety begins to color some days\r\nbefore ripe and should be picked before fully matured if it is to be kept\r\nor shipped. Usually the best specimens of Burbank come from thinned trees\r\nand thinning is a necessary operation in all commercial orchards. The\r\nvariety does not thrive in the South, being poor in quality and rotting\r\nbadly. In New York, Burbank is not being planted nearly so largely as a\r\nfew years ago, the Domesticas being much more profitable than this or\r\nother Triflora plums. It is a very desirable variety for home plantations\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nBurbank was produced from a plum pit sent to Luther Burbank[207] by\r\na Japanese agent in 1883.[208] The fruit of this variety proved to be\r\nvery superior and Mr. Burbank sent specimens of it to the Division of\r\nPomology, United States Department of Agriculture in 1887, where it was\r\nnamed in honor of the introducer. Wassu, introduced by J. L. Normand,\r\nand the Russian plum, 20 M, sent out by Professor J. L. Budd proved to\r\nbe indistinguishable from the Burbank as tested by Bailey, but Kerr[209]\r\nthinks the Wassu is a distinct variety. The American Pomological Society\r\nadded Burbank to the fruit list in its catalog in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, distinguished by its low, sprawling habit\r\n    and flat open top, unusually hardy for a Japanese variety,\r\n    very productive, healthy; branches somewhat roughish, dark\r\n    ash-gray, thickly covered with fruit-spurs, with few, large,\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets medium in thickness and length,\r\n    with short internodes, greenish-red changing to dark brown,\r\n    with gray scarf-skin, glossy, glabrous, with raised lenticels\r\n    of medium size and number; leaf-buds short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, broadly oblanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, three and three-quarters inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface light green, smooth, pubescent only on the\r\n    deeply grooved midrib; lower surface glabrous, pubescent on the\r\n    midrib; apex taper-pointed, base cuneate, margin finely and\r\n    doubly serrate, with small amber or reddish glands; petiole\r\n    nine-sixteenths inch long, sparingly hairy on one side, tinged\r\n    red, with from one to four small, reniform or globose glands\r\n    mostly on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and short; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves, white; borne in dense clusters on the lateral buds\r\n    and spurs, in threes; pedicels one-quarter inch long, thick,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, glandular-serrate, glabrous, erect; petals\r\n    broadly oval, entire, short-clawed; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season long; variable in size, large when the tree\r\n    is not overloaded, one and three-quarters inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-conic, halves equal; cavity deep, abrupt, regular;\r\n    suture shallow; apex roundish; color dark red over a yellow\r\n    ground, mottled, with thick bloom; dots numerous, large,\r\n    russet, conspicuous; stem five-eighths inch long, glabrous,\r\n    parting readily from the fruit; skin thin, tough, sour,\r\n    separating from the pulp; flesh deep yellow, juicy, tender,\r\n    firm, sweet, aromatic; good; stone clinging, three-quarters\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, roundish-oval, turgid, blunt\r\n    but sharp-tipped, roughish, with a slightly winged ventral\r\n    suture; dorsal suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHABOT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHABOT]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

They are large, beautifully molded and\r\nhandsomely mottled in shades of red over yellow with occasional splashes\r\nof russet and a heavy but delicate bloom. To secure the best coloring,\r\nthe fruit must be picked before ripe and be matured in dark storage.\r\nEarly picking is necessary also because the season of ripening is very\r\nlong and the fruit drops badly if permitted to hang to the trees until\r\nfully ripe. There should be at least three pickings for this variety.\r\nUnfortunately, the quality of Chabot belies its appearance, being at\r\nbest not above the average. The fruits are firm and ship well and keep\r\nrather better than those of any other plum of its species. The trees are\r\nhardy and dependable in bearing but not as productive as could be wished.\r\nThe blossoms of Chabot open later than those of most other Trifloras,\r\nenabling this sort occasionally to escape frosts which injure other\r\nvarieties of this species. The stamens are often short, undeveloped and\r\nwholly or in part sterile. Because of its attractive fruit this variety\r\nmight well be grown more than it is for the markets.\r\n\r\nChabot was imported from Japan by a Mr. Chabot of Berkeley, California,\r\nand was introduced to the trade by Luther Burbank in 1886. As with\r\nAbundance, the nomenclature of Chabot is badly confused. Several names\r\nthat have been found to be synonymous with the former have also been\r\napplied to the latter. J. L. Normand, Marksville, Louisiana, imported\r\ntrees from Japan, among which was a tree that was different from any\r\ngrowing on his grounds. He named this variety after Bailey and introduced\r\nit in 1891. Later this was found to be identical with Chabot. Furugiya,\r\nanother introduction by Normand, is undoubtedly Chabot. H. N. Starnes\r\nof the Georgia Experiment Station, who has tested many of the Japanese\r\nplums, published in Bulletin 68 of his station, the additional synonyms:\r\nChase, O-hattankio, Hytankayo, Douglas, Hon-smomo and Babcock. Orient,\r\nintroduced by Stark Brothers, Louisiana, Missouri, in 1893, is Chabot as\r\ntested at the New York and Ohio experiment stations. Paragon, introduced\r\nby the Rogers Nursery Company, Moorestown, New Jersey, has also proved to\r\nbe identical. In 1897 the American Pomological Society added this variety\r\nto its fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, vasiform or upright-spreading,\r\n    open-topped, slow-growing, hardy, productive, susceptible to\r\n    attacks of shot-hole fungus; branches roughish, the fruit-spurs\r\n    numerous, dark ash-gray, with raised lenticels variable in\r\n    size; branchlets slender, with short intemodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dark chestnut-red, glossy, glabrous, with numerous,\r\n    conspicuous, rather large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small,\r\n    short, obtuse, somewhat appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oblanceolate, peach-like, one\r\n    and one-quarter inches wide, three inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface light green, smooth, with a shallow, grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, glabrous except at the base of the\r\n    veins; apex acutely pointed, base cuneate, margin finely\r\n    serrate, with small, amber or dark red glands; petiole one-half\r\n    inch long, slender, slightly pubescent along the upper surface,\r\n    heavily tinged with red, glandless or with from one to six\r\n    small, globose or reniform, greenish-brown glands usually on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate and long; flowers appearing with\r\n    the leaves, white; borne in clusters on lateral spurs in pairs\r\n    or in threes; pedicels three-eighths inch long, pubescent,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic, pubescent at the base;\r\n    calyx-lobes obtuse, glandular, somewhat serrate, pubescent at\r\n    the base, erect; petals broadly oval, entire, with narrow,\r\n    long claws; anthers shrivelled; filaments nearly sessile or\r\n    one-eighth inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the stamens;\r\n    stigma small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches in diameter, cordate or roundish, halves equal; cavity\r\n    deep, flaring, with concentric, russet rings; suture distinct;\r\n    apex roundish or pointed; color light and dark shades of red\r\n    over yellow, mottled, with occasional splashes of russet and\r\n    with a thick but delicate bloom; dots numerous, small, russet\r\n    or yellow, conspicuous unless obscured by the bloom, clustered\r\n    around the apex; stem thick, one-half inch long, adhering to\r\n    the fruit; skin medium in thickness, tender, bitter, separating\r\n    easily; flesh golden-yellow, very juicy, coarse and fibrous,\r\n    tender, somewhat melting when fully ripe, sweet, although\r\n    somewhat tart at the center, sprightly, with characteristic\r\n    Triflora flavor; good; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, oval, turgid, slightly necked, with\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture wide; dorsal suture unfurrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALCO\r\n\r\n_Prunus simonii_ × _Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 4. 1898. =2.= _Rural N.

The\r\ntree is rather better than that of the Simon plum or of the Wickson, the\r\ntwo plums with which it must be compared. The amateur may care to plant\r\nChalco but here its usefulness ends. Burbank in introducing this plum in\r\n1898, stated that it was the first fruit offered after twelve years’ work\r\nin crossing _Prunus simonii_ with _Prunus triflora_ and American species.\r\nThe parentage of Chalco is given as a Simon-Burbank cross. The following\r\ndescription is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright or somewhat vasiform, very productive;\r\n    leaves large, dark green. Fruit matures shortly before Burbank;\r\n    large when well grown, oblate, dark red; flesh yellowish, firm,\r\n    very juicy, aromatic, sweet; good; stone small, oval, slightly\r\n    flattened, semi-free.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMBOURCY\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rev.

Bourgeois; no record of its\r\nparents seems to have been made. M. Latinois introduced it into commerce\r\nin 1885-1886 and consequently his name became attached to the variety.\r\nThe plum is not well known in America, there being only one published\r\nAmerican reference. This Station received the variety for testing in 1899\r\nfrom the United States Department of Agriculture. It has value on account\r\nof its high quality and its lateness, and is worthy of extensive testing.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, upright-spreading, dense-topped, productive;\r\n    branchlets develop fruit-spurs near the base; leaf-buds\r\n    strongly appressed; leaves folded upward, long-oval or obovate,\r\n    one and five-eighths inches wide, three and three-quarters\r\n    inches long, somewhat leathery; margin doubly serrate or\r\n    crenate, with small dark glands; blooming season intermediate\r\n    in time and length; flowers appearing after the leaves, over\r\n    one inch across; borne in thin clusters on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season of medium length; nearly one and\r\n    one-half inches in diameter, roundish, slightly truncate,\r\n    yellowish-green, with a delicate bloom and a pink blush on the\r\n    exposed cheek; flesh greenish-yellow, very juicy, firm but\r\n    tender, sweet, aromatic, of high flavor; very good to best;\r\n    stone semi-free or free, three-quarters inch, by one-half inch\r\n    in size, irregular-oval, flattened, rather blunt at the base\r\n    and apex, with roughened surfaces; ventral suture strongly\r\n    furrowed, often with a distinct wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPION\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Wickson _Cal.

It has not proved to be a good\r\nplum for prune-making, as it is too juicy, about three-fourths of its\r\nbulk evaporating, but the western plum-growers have found it a very\r\ngood plum for shipping in the fresh state. It is very attractive in\r\nappearance, firm, free of stone, sweet and pleasant and withal of rather\r\nhigh quality. The tree-characters, as the plums grow in Geneva, are in\r\nthe main very good, falling short, if at all, in productiveness. They\r\nare such as to lead to the recommendation of a trial for this plum by\r\nplum-growers in general in New York.\r\n\r\nThis variety is a seedling of the Italian Prune produced by Jesse\r\nBullock, Oswego, Oregon, about 1876, and introduced by C. E. Hoskins,\r\nSpringbrook, Oregon. Since the Italian Prune comes nearly true to seed it\r\nis very doubtful if this variety is a pure-bred seedling judging from the\r\ncharacters of the fruit as given below:\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    hardy, productive, an early bearer, subject to sun-scald;\r\n    branches ash-gray, rather smooth, with few, small lenticels;\r\n    branchlets short, with very short internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to brownish-red, dull, sparingly pubescent throughout\r\n    the season, with few inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    below medium in size, short, obtuse, free, plump.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    three inches long; upper surface somewhat rugose, covered with\r\n    numerous, fine hairs, with a shallow groove on the midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, pubescent: apex abruptly pointed\r\n    or acute, base acute, margin crenate, with small black glands;\r\n    petiole one-half inch long, green, pubescent, with from one to\r\n    three medium to large, globose, brownish glands mostly at the\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one inch across, white with a\r\n    yellowish tinge at the apex of the petals; borne on lateral\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch long,\r\n    with a few scattering hairs, green; calyx-tube greenish,\r\n    campanulate, sparingly pubescent; calyx-lobes obtuse, pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, somewhat reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, crenate, tapering to short, broad claws: anthers\r\n    yellow; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    slightly shorter or equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit earlier than Italian Prune; about one and one-half\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish, compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity very shallow, abrupt, narrow, regular; suture shallow;\r\n    apex roundish, with a slight depression at the pistil-point;\r\n    color dark purplish-black, with thick bloom; dots small,\r\n    russet, somewhat conspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem\r\n    five-eighths inch long, sparingly pubescent, parting readily\r\n    from the fruit; skin thick, tough, sour, adhering but little;\r\n    flesh attractive yellow, juicy, firm, sweet, pleasant flavor;\r\n    very good; stone free, the cavity larger than the pit,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, irregular-oval,\r\n    the surface distinctly roughened and pitted; ventral suture\r\n    swollen, rather narrow, often with a wing; dorsal suture with a\r\n    shallow, narrow, indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHENEY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHENEY]\r\n\r\n_Prunus nigra_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Wis.

Of the varieties illustrated and described among\r\nthe leading plums in this text, Cheney is the sole representative of\r\n_Prunus nigra_, the wild plum of Canada and of northern United States.\r\nThe accompanying description shows that while the fruit of this variety\r\nis not such as to recommend it where other species can be grown, the tree\r\nhas some characters most desirable wherever plums are grown—hardiness,\r\nvigor, productiveness and good form—so that this variety might well be\r\nused in breeding plums. The trees are very ornamental whether in flower,\r\nfull leaf or fruit, but especially when in full bloom as they bear a\r\ngreat profusion of large white flowers which change to a pleasing pink\r\nbefore falling.\r\n\r\nThis plum, according to a letter from the discoverer, E. Markle, of\r\nLa Crosse, Wisconsin, was found in the brush on a ridge, in Vernon\r\nCounty, Wisconsin, about twenty-five or thirty years ago. Mr. Markle\r\nthought it must have sprung from a seed dropped by an early voyager of\r\nthe Mississippi River as there were no similar plums in the region.\r\nNoting its good qualities Mr. Markle introduced the variety, the date of\r\nintroduction being about 1887. The American Pomological Society added\r\nCheney to its fruit catalog list in 1897, where, however, it remained but\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive, bears early, somewhat susceptible to disease;\r\n    branches numerous, dark brownish-gray, very thorny, with large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets long, with long internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dull reddish-brown, dull, thickly pubescent\r\n    early in the season, the pubescence decreasing at maturity,\r\n    with raised lenticels which are variable in size; leaf-buds\r\n    smallish, short, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and three-quarters inches wide,\r\n    three and five-eighths inches long, thin; upper surface dark\r\n    green, nearly smooth, pubescent only along the midrib which\r\n    is deeply grooved; lower surface yellowish-green, pubescent\r\n    along the midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed, margin\r\n    crenate, usually in two series, sometimes with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, rather slender, pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, showy, about one inch across, white\r\n    changing to pink; borne in clusters on lateral spurs, in pairs\r\n    or in threes, very fragrant; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, pubescent, green with a trace of red; calyx-tube obconic,\r\n    glabrous, red on the outer surface but green within and pinkish\r\n    along the margin; calyx-lobes obtuse or acute, serrate, with\r\n    small red glands and with marginal hairs, narrow, sparingly\r\n    pubescent on the inner surface, reflexed; petals broadly oval,\r\n    crenate, often toothed, tapering below to long narrow claws;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments nearly one-half inch in length;\r\n    pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period very long; medium in size,\r\n    irregular roundish-oval, strongly oblique, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, regular, flaring; suture shallow or a line; apex\r\n    roundish, somewhat oblique; color at first yellowish-green with\r\n    a light carmine blush changing to deep carmine on a yellow\r\n    ground, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, very small,\r\n    russet, inconspicuous, densely clustered about the apex; stem\r\n    slender, five-eighths inch in length, slightly pubescent,\r\n    adhering to the fruit; skin thick, tough, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh deep yellow, very juicy, fibrous, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet next to the skin but tart at the center, not\r\n    high in flavor; fair in quality; stone adhering, seven-eighths\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, broadly oval, distinctly\r\n    flattened, blunt-pointed, with ridged and furrowed surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture acute, narrow; dorsal suture slightly furrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMAX\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIMAX]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus simonii_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rural N.

From the behavior\r\nof the trees on the grounds of this Station where we have had fruit of\r\nit for eight years, we should say at once that Climax has no place in\r\nthe plum-growing regions of the East but others who have grown it speak\r\nso well of it, the fruit in particular, that the unfavorable opinion\r\nof the variety formed here may be unjust. Some of the expressions\r\nregarding this fruit in the foregoing references may be dismissed at\r\nonce as the most wildly extravagant and absurd to be found in plum\r\nliterature. From its behavior on these grounds and in the plum-growing\r\nregions of the East in general, it seems certain that Climax cannot\r\nstand the vicissitudes of the climate, suffering both in winter and\r\nsummer. The trees, in size, vigor and habit of growth, are inferior to\r\nthose of most Triflora varieties, and those under observation in this\r\npart of New York are not as productive as the standard Trifloras with\r\nwhich Climax must be compared. The fruit is handsome in shape and color,\r\nmore so in color than the accompanying illustration shows, and is of\r\ngood quality. Unfortunately it is very susceptible to the brown-rot, so\r\nmuch so that because of this defect alone Climax could hardly become a\r\nprofitable commercial plum in this region. It has been quite well tested\r\nin various parts of New York and has proved so uniformly disappointing in\r\ntree-characters, in particular, that it cannot be recommended as other\r\nthan a plum for the home collection where, because of its beauty and\r\nquality, it is most desirable.\r\n\r\nClimax is another of Luther Burbank’s plums, having been introduced in\r\n1899. The originator states that it is a selected hybrid between the\r\nSimon and Botan plums. The variety was first described as the Royal but\r\nsince this name had been previously given to a European plum it was\r\nrenamed Climax.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, somewhat straggling,\r\n    dense-topped, semi-hardy, medium productive; branches dark\r\n    ash-gray, short and stout, with numerous lenticels; branchlets\r\n    short, with very short internodes, brownish chestnut-red,\r\n    glossy, glabrous, with numerous conspicuous, small, raised\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oblanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    one-quarter inches wide, three and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface light green, smooth, with a grooved midrib,\r\n    glabrous; lower surface light green, glabrous except on the\r\n    midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base cuneate,\r\n    margin finely serrate or crenate, with small, dark brown\r\n    glands; petiole nine-sixteenths inch long, sparsely pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to seven small, globose\r\n    or slightly compressed, reddish glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    with the leaves, white; borne in clusters of three, on lateral\r\n    spurs; pedicels, long, thick, glabrous, green; calyx tube\r\n    greenish, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, with a few\r\n    hair-like glands, glabrous, erect; petals roundish-oval,\r\n    entire; anthers deep yellow; filaments short; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length; stigma very small.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and three-quarters inches\r\n    in diameter, cordate or roundish, slightly compressed, halves\r\n    unequal; cavity deep, abrupt, regular, marked with faint,\r\n    reddish, radiating streaks; suture deep, broad; apex pointed;\r\n    color dark red, mottled; bloom of medium thickness; dots\r\n    numerous, variable in size, russet, conspicuous, clustered\r\n    about the base; stem thick, nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    glabrous, parting readily from the fruit; skin thick, bitter,\r\n    with a tendency to crack, separating easily from the pulp only\r\n    when fully ripe; flesh yellowish, very juicy, somewhat fibrous,\r\n    tender and melting, sweet, pleasant flavored, aromatic; good;\r\n    stone adhering, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, somewhat long-oval, pointed, roughish, conspicuously\r\n    winged and grooved on the ventral suture; dorsal suture\r\n    slightly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLING STEM\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N. Y. Sta. Rpt._ =9=:347. 1890.\r\n\r\nThis plum belongs to the Reine Claude group, a group in which there is\r\nroom for new varieties only at the top. Cling Stem is inferior, falling\r\nshort chiefly in quality, for a plum of its type, and it is doubtful if\r\nit is worth general planting. This Station alone seems to have tested\r\nthe variety, hence the rather full description which follows of a plum\r\nwhich cannot be recommended. The variety was sent here in 1890 from North\r\nFerrisburg, Vermont, by L. M. Macomber.\r\n\r\n    Tree large and vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, very\r\n    productive; branches rough, the bark marked by concentric\r\n    rings, with numerous spurs and with many, small, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets short, pubescent; leaf-scars swollen;\r\n    leaves folded upward, oval, one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, three inches long, rather thick and leathery; margin\r\n    doubly crenate, eglandular or with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    pubescent, tinged red, glandless or with from one to three\r\n    globose glands usually at the base of the leaf; blooming season\r\n    of medium length; flowers over one inch across, white with\r\n    yellowish tinge near the apex of the petals; borne on lateral\r\n    buds and spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-half inches by one and\r\n    five-eighths inches in size, nearly roundish, dull light\r\n    yellow, sometimes mottled with red on the exposed cheek,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; skin thin, sour; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, tender and melting, sweet near the surface\r\n    but acid at the center, mild, pleasant, but not high-flavored;\r\n    stone clinging, three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, nearly round, turgid; surfaces pitted; ventral suture\r\n    broad, heavily furrowed, with a short, distinct wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLYMAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

The\r\nfruit resembles that of Lombard somewhat, but is smaller and is much\r\nbetter in quality. As grown in California the Clyman commands high prices\r\nfor shipping eastward. Whether it could be grown profitably in the East\r\nremains to be seen but it deserves to be rather widely tested for an\r\nearly home and market plum. In New York it has a few serious faults:\r\nthe plums are susceptible to rot, they drop as soon as ripe and the\r\ntrees seem not to be quite hardy at Geneva; though in the Ohio reference\r\ngiven above they are said to be “rather hardier than those of most other\r\nEuropean sorts.” Otherwise than in hardiness the trees at this place are\r\nquite satisfactory. The variety is characterized by very long stamens.\r\nClyman is well deserving of trial with the possibility that it may prove\r\nto be the best of our early Domesticas.\r\n\r\nThis plum was raised from a Peach plum stone planted in 1866, by Mrs.\r\nHannah Clyman, Napa City, Napa Valley, California. The original tree\r\nwas cut down but several suckers were taken from the roots and planted\r\nin an orchard. These bore fruit for many years, never failing to mature\r\na crop. In 1886, Leonard Coates, a nurseryman and fruit-grower of Napa\r\nCity, became interested in the plum on account of its extreme earliness\r\nand offered it to his customers. The American Pomological Society added\r\nClyman to its fruit catalog list in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree rather large, vigorous, round and dense-topped, semi-hardy\r\n    in New York, productive; branches ash-gray, nearly smooth, with\r\n    numerous, small, raised lenticels; branchlets thick, rather\r\n    long, with internodes of medium length, greenish-red changing\r\n    to brownish-red, dull, heavily pubescent throughout the season,\r\n    with numerous, indistinct, small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium\r\n    size and length, conical, appressed; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate, one and seven-eighths inches\r\n    wide, three and one-quarter inches long; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose, sparingly hairy; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin\r\n    serrate or crenate, covered with small dark glands; petiole\r\n    nearly seven-eighths inch long, pubescent, reddish, glandless\r\n    or with from one to three globose, greenish-yellow glands\r\n    variable in size and position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white, the\r\n    buds creamy at the apex when unfolding; borne in clusters on\r\n    lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels about one-half\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, serrate, reflexed; petals obovate, dentate,\r\n    tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellow; filaments about\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil pubescent near the base,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and one-half inches by one\r\n    and three-eighths inches in size, oval, halves equal; cavity\r\n    narrow, abrupt, regular; suture shallow and often indistinct;\r\n    apex roundish or slightly depressed; color dark purplish-red,\r\n    covered with thick bloom; dots numerous, small, russet,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem five-eighths inches long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering poorly to the fruit; skin tender, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh pale yellow, dry, firm, sweet, mild but\r\n    pleasant; of good quality; stone free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, somewhat flattened, irregular-oval,\r\n    with pitted surfaces, tapering abruptly at the base, nearly\r\n    acute at the apex; ventral suture of medium width, usually\r\n    rather blunt; dorsal suture with a wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mag.

The trees are productive and the fruit large and\r\nhandsome but not of highest quality and moreover drops badly and is very\r\nsusceptible to the brown-rot. Columbia originated early in the second\r\nquarter of the Nineteenth Century with L. V. Lawrence of Hudson, New\r\nYork, from seed of Reine Claude.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, medium in vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; trunk stocky, rough; branches thick; branchlets\r\n    pubescent; leaves folded upward, one and seven-eighths inches\r\n    wide, four and one-quarter inches long, oval, thick, leathery;\r\n    upper surface rugose; margin serrate or crenate, with small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole thick, tinged red, pubescent, with from\r\n    one to three globose glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; when well grown nearly one and one-half\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish-oval, the smaller specimens rather\r\n    ovate, dark purplish-red, overspread with thick bloom; stem\r\n    surrounded by a fleshy ring at the cavity; skin tender, sour;\r\n    flesh golden-yellow, dry, firm, sweet, mild; of good quality;\r\n    stone semi-free or free, seven-eighths inch by three-quarters\r\n    inch in size, roundish-oval, flattened; ventral suture\r\n    prominent; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPASS\r\n\r\n_Prunus besseyi_ × _Prunus hortulana mineri_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Northwestern Agr._ 348. 1895. =2.= _Vt.

Knudson of Springfield, Minnesota, pollinated the Sand Cherry\r\nwith pollen from the Danish Morello cherry and the Miner plum. The seed\r\nof the resulting cross, beyond question that of the Sand Cherry and\r\nthe plum, was planted on August seventh of the same year and, in 1894\r\nproduced fruit for the first time. In 1893 C. W. H. Heideman of New Ulm,\r\nMinnesota, secured a cion from this tree and another the following year.\r\nIn 1895 Heideman introduced as his own, under the name of Heideman Sand\r\nCherry, a hybrid between the Sand Cherry and a plum. In the controversy\r\nwhich followed it developed that the two hybrids were identical and that\r\nKnudson was the real originator. Subsequently C. W. Sampson of Eureka,\r\nMinnesota, introduced Knudson’s plum under the name Compass. The variety\r\nis of interest to plant-breeders and may have some commercial value in\r\nthe Northwest but is worthless for its fruit in New York.\r\n\r\n    Tree inferior in size, spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    branches and branchlets slender, the branchlets marked by very\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds plump; leaves\r\n    folded upward, one and one-eighth inches wide, three inches\r\n    long; margin serrate; petiole tinged red, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three globose glands usually on the base of the\r\n    leaf; blooming season late, of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, creamy-white as\r\n    the buds unfold; borne on lateral spurs, in threes and fours.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; seven-eighths inch by three-quarters\r\n    inch in size, ovate or roundish-oval, light red changing\r\n    to dark red at maturity, the skin speckled with small red\r\n    dots before fully ripe; skin tough, astringent; flesh light\r\n    greenish-yellow, very juicy, melting, subacid except near the\r\n    skin; poor; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by three-eighths\r\n    inch in size, large, elongated-oval, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Coxe _Cult.

French Copper 1, 2, 6.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that Copper came from France but very little is actually\r\nknown regarding its history. The round early variety described by Coxe\r\nand Prince is distinct from the Copper now grown in this country. It\r\nis probable that the Copper of Downing and of the American Pomological\r\nSociety are either distinct, or are early strains of the fruit described\r\nhere, since both are mid-season plums while the variety of the following\r\ndescription is distinctly late. This old sort has been recommended of\r\nlate by nurserymen and some plum-growers and it may be worth putting on\r\nthe markets again as the trees are extremely productive, the fruit ships\r\nwell, and its extreme lateness might extend the plum season. The fruit\r\nis not fit for dessert but makes an attractive, dark red, well-flavored\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\n    Tree variable in size and vigor, round and dense-topped,\r\n    productive; branches numerous, with large lenticels; branchlets\r\n    twiggy, marked with scarf-skin, glabrous throughout the season;\r\n    leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, three and one-half inches long; upper surface rugose;\r\n    margin serrate or crenate, eglandular or with small dark\r\n    glands; petiole pubescent, tinged red, glandless or with one or\r\n    two globose glands; blooming time mid-season, short; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across; borne\r\n    singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season of medium length; one and one-half\r\n    inches by one and three-eighths inches in size, roundish-oval,\r\n    slightly necked; cavity almost lacking; color a metallic\r\n    brownish-purple, overspread with thick bloom; skin thick,\r\n    tough, somewhat astringent; flesh dull yellow, medium juicy,\r\n    firm, moderately sweet; poor; stone free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, irregular-ovate, abruptly contracted at\r\n    the base, with roughened surfaces; dorsal suture prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITTENDEN\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 695. 1884. =2.= Mathieu _Nom.

In both Europe\r\nand America it seems to be as well known under the names Farleigh and\r\nCluster as under its true name. Crittenden ranks high among the Damsons\r\nin England but in America it is not a great favorite; just why is hard\r\nto say. It is likely that it fails in some tree-character, for, with the\r\nexception of being a little too tart, the fruit has few faults.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; branches very thorny and spinescent; branchlets\r\n    pubescent throughout the season; leaf-buds plump; leaves folded\r\n    upward, obovate or oval, one and one-eighth inches wide, two\r\n    and one-half inches long, thin; margin finely serrate, with\r\n    small dark glands; petiole one-half inch long, glandless or\r\n    with one or two glands; blooming season intermediate in time\r\n    and length; flowers appearing after the leaves, seven-eighths\r\n    inch across, densely clustered; borne usually in twos, fragrant.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season of medium length; seven-eighths inch\r\n    by three-quarters inch in size, oval, slightly necked,\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with very thick bloom; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, medium juicy, firm but tender, sour,\r\n    sprightly; probably good for preserves; stone clinging,\r\n    five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size, oval, acute at\r\n    the base, with surfaces nearly smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCZAR\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 693. 1884. =2.= Ellwanger & Barry _Cat._\r\n    27. 1886. =3.= _Gard.

The Czar 2, 6, 11. _The Czar_ 4.\r\n\r\nCzar seems to have a very good reputation in Europe, in England\r\nespecially, as a culinary fruit but in America it is but second rate for\r\ncooking and cannot be called a dessert plum at all. Its earliness might\r\nmake it valuable were it not for the fact that Clyman is as early and in\r\nnearly all other respects is a better plum. The Czar, like Clyman, is\r\nnot quite hardy and lacks somewhat in productiveness. The stone of Czar\r\nis usually covered with a granular, gummy exudation about the apex and\r\nits flowers are peculiar in being more or less doubled. It is doubtful\r\nif this variety is worth planting in New York. This plum was raised by\r\nThomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, from a Prince Englebert seed\r\nfertilized by Early Prolific. It first fruited in 1874 and was named for\r\nthe Czar of Russia who visited England during the same year. Ellwanger &\r\nBarry, of Rochester, New York, offered it for sale in the United States\r\nin 1886.\r\n\r\n    Tree intermediate in size and vigor, round and open-topped,\r\n    not always hardy, moderately productive; branches covered\r\n    with many fruit-spurs, smooth except for the numerous raised\r\n    lenticels and transverse cracks in the bark; branchlets covered\r\n    with thick pubescence throughout the season, with numerous\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds large, strongly free; leaves folded\r\n    upward, oval, one and three-quarters inches wide, three inches\r\n    long; petiole one-half inch long, thick, pubescent, eglandular\r\n    or with one or two large, yellowish-green glands at the base\r\n    of the leaf; blooming season intermediate in time, short;\r\n    flowers appearing after the leaves, one inch or more across,\r\n    white, with a yellowish tinge at the apex of the petals; borne\r\n    in clusters on lateral spurs, in pairs or in threes; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous except at the base,\r\n    slightly longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and one-half inches\r\n    in diameter, irregular roundish-oval, compressed, dark\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; flesh yellow,\r\n    coarse and somewhat granular, fibrous, tender, sweet, pleasant\r\n    flavor; good; stone free, three-quarters inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, oval or slightly ovate, blunt at the base,\r\n    somewhat acute at the apex, with ridged and roughened surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture wide, broadly furrowed, with a short blunt wing;\r\n    dorsal suture acute or with a narrow, shallow, indistinct\r\n    groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMSON\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

In\r\nproductiveness, vigor of tree and hardiness it is scarcely surpassed by\r\nany of its kind and while its fruits are smaller and more astringent\r\nthan the best of its offspring they are not surpassed for the chief use\r\nof all Damsons—the making of preserves. The chief asset of the Damson\r\nis its great adaptability to various soils and climates, surpassing all\r\nnewcomers of its type in this respect. So while undoubtedly some of\r\nthe improved Damsons surpass the parent variety under many conditions,\r\nthere yet remain localities in which the original stock is possibly most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe Damson takes its name from Damascus from whence it was brought into\r\nItaly at least a century before the Christian era. What is a Damson?\r\nIn England and America it is an oval, usually black, Insititia. The\r\nEuropean continental countries have an entirely different conception of\r\na Damson from that of the English and Americans. The Germans speak of\r\nour common plums as Damson-like, while the French use the term Damas\r\nindiscriminately. The English, however, have not always made a sharp\r\ndistinction for Parkinson in 1629 speaks of the great Damaske or Damson\r\nPlummes as sweet prunes imported from France and Gerard in 1636 described\r\nthe Damson tree as synonymous to the Plum. The term Damson is applied to\r\na group as well as to a variety. For a further history of this plum in\r\nEurope and America see the index for references to the Damson in Chapter\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWSON\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    _Dawson Seedling._ _American Prune._\r\n\r\nDawson is a prune-like plum characterized by an elongated neck, a\r\npeculiar putty-like color of flesh and by large size. The quality is very\r\ngood and the trees in all characters are well up to the average of those\r\nof the plums on the Station grounds. The plum is worthy a more extensive\r\ntrial than it has yet had. The following history of the variety is given\r\nby its originator: In 1884, P. P. Dawson of Payette, Idaho, planted a\r\nlot of Italian prune pits. In 1891 one of the seedlings produced fruit\r\nwhich was so distinct as to size that Mr. Dawson deemed it worthy of\r\npropagation. The variety was introduced by Mr. Dawson and A. F. Hitt,\r\nWeiser, Idaho, about 1898.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, round and dense-topped,\r\n    productive; branchlets thick, short, twiggy, marked with\r\n    scarf-skin; leaf-scars prominent; leaves flattened, oval, two\r\n    and one-quarter inches wide, four inches long, dark green,\r\n    rugose; margin doubly crenate, eglandular or with small dark\r\n    glands; petiole pubescent, glandless or with one or two small\r\n    glands usually at the base of the leaf; blooming season late,\r\n    short; flowers appearing with the leaves, white with yellowish\r\n    tinge; petals fringed at the apex.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; medium in size,\r\n    strongly obovate, distinctly necked, dark reddish-purple,\r\n    overspread with medium thick bloom; flesh light but dull\r\n    yellow, tinged red near the surface, dry, firm, medium sweet,\r\n    mild but pleasant; of good quality; stone clinging, above\r\n    medium in size, long-oval or ovate, flattened, distinctly\r\n    necked, with roughened surfaces; ventral suture broad, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECAISNE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

The plums are garnet-red, very attractive in\r\nappearance and are borne so much earlier than those of other species\r\nthat the variety may be worth planting in home orchards to lengthen the\r\nseason and for the sake of variety. This plum is grown rather commonly\r\nin the South where the fruits are said to keep well and not rot. The\r\ntrees are handsome ornamentals bearing remarkably rich, green foliage and\r\na profusion of white flowers which are followed by beautifully colored\r\nfruits. The variety can be recommended for lawn or park where a small,\r\ncompact, flowering tree is wanted.\r\n\r\nDe Caradeuc originated with A. De Caradeuc, Aiken, South Carolina,\r\nbetween 1850 and 1854. Mr. De Caradeuc brought plum trees from France\r\nand planted them in the vicinity of several native plum trees. From the\r\nseed of the former he produced this variety. The originator believed\r\nhis new plum to be a hybrid but practically all students of plum botany\r\nthink that it is a pure offshoot of _Prunus cerasifera_. The variety was\r\nintroduced by P. J. Berckmans of Augusta, Georgia. In 1877 De Caradeuc\r\nwas placed on the American Pomological Society fruit catalog list where\r\nit is still maintained.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, variable\r\n    in productiveness; trunk rough; branches slender, roughish or\r\n    smooth, dark ash-gray, with numerous, large, raised lenticels;\r\n    branchlets very numerous, twiggy, slender, medium to long, with\r\n    long internodes, tinged with red when young, changing to dull\r\n    reddish-brown, glossy, glabrous, with few, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds very small and short, obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves numerous on the branchlets, becoming scattering in the\r\n    interior of the tree, folded upward, oval, one and one-eighth\r\n    inches wide, two inches long, thin; upper surface dark green,\r\n    sparingly pubescent, smooth, with broadly grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex acute, base broadly\r\n    cuneate, margin often in two series of fine serrations,\r\n    without glands; petiole slender, one-half inch long, slightly\r\n    pubescent, tinged red, eglandular or with one or two very\r\n    small, globose, greenish glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season rather early, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, white; borne\r\n    on lateral buds and spurs; pedicels eleven-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, below medium in thickness, glabrous, green; calyx-tube\r\n    reddish, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse,\r\n    slightly glandular-serrate, pubescent, strongly reflexed;\r\n    petals roundish or ovate, crenate, not clawed; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments one-quarter inch in length; pistil glabrous, longer\r\n    than the stamens, somewhat defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and one-quarter inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish, halves usually equal; cavity shallow\r\n    and narrow, abrupt, regular; suture a dark red line; apex\r\n    roundish; color light or dark crimson-red over a yellow ground,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; dots few, light russet, clustered\r\n    about the apex; stem slender, eleven-sixteenths inch in length,\r\n    glabrous, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tough, parting\r\n    readily; flesh medium yellow, very juicy, fibrous, tender\r\n    and melting, slightly sweet, lacking in flavor; inferior in\r\n    quality; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by one-half inch\r\n    in size, roundish-oval, turgid, blunt, with somewhat pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture acute, furrowed; dorsal suture\r\n    distinctly and broadly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE SOTO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DE SOTO]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ill.

Trayer 4.\r\n\r\nDe Soto probably holds first place among the Americana plums in the favor\r\nof fruit-growers. The qualities which commend it are: A tree rather\r\nbetter suited to the orchard than other varieties of _Prunus americana_\r\nhaving little of the waywardness of most sorts of its species and\r\nsomewhat the manner of growth of the European plums. The trees, too, are\r\nenormously productive, so much so that in many cases their vitality is\r\nweakened by over-bearing unless thinned. The fruits of De Soto, while not\r\nas large nor as brilliantly colored as some of the Americanas, are not\r\nsurpassed by any of the native plums in quality and keep and ship as well\r\nas any. The variety becomes, therefore, a market sort of value in some\r\nregions. The fruits are a little more subject to curculio than those of\r\nmost of the native plums and the trees blight in the South somewhat and\r\ndo not stand the drouths of the Mississippi Valley as well as some other\r\nvarieties. Notwithstanding these defects, speaking generally, the De Soto\r\nmay be recommended as one of the best of its species.\r\n\r\nDe Soto was found on the bank of the Mississippi River near De Soto,\r\nWisconsin. The first settler to call attention to the plum was a Mr.\r\nTupper who settled on the land where it was found in 1853 or 1854. The\r\nTrayer Brothers bought the place in 1855 and in clearing the farm they\r\nremoved all the plum trees except a grove of what was at first called\r\nTrayer, afterwards De Soto. Later Stephen Heal came into possession\r\nof the property and in 1864 Elisha Hale, Lansing, Iowa, commenced to\r\ncultivate and disseminate the variety. De Soto was placed on the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog list in 1883, dropped in 1891, and\r\nrestored again in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, intermediate in vigor, spreading, open-topped,\r\n    perfectly hardy, produces heavy crops annually, bears young;\r\n    branches rough and shaggy, somewhat zigzag, thorny, dark\r\n    ash-brown, with inconspicuous, small, raised, lenticels;\r\n    branchlets numerous, long, green, changing to dull\r\n    reddish-brown, pubescent at first, becoming glabrous late\r\n    in the season, with conspicuous, large, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds below medium in size, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, oval, one and\r\n    three-quarters inches wide, four inches long; upper surface\r\n    dark green changing to greenish-yellow, glossy, with scattering\r\n    hairs and a narrow, grooved midrib; lower surface finely\r\n    pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base somewhat abrupt, margin\r\n    very coarsely and deeply doubly serrate, petiole five-eighths\r\n    inch long, of medium thickness, pubescent, tinged red,\r\n    glandless or with one or two globose, brownish glands on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late and of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    white; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in twos and\r\n    threes; pedicels eleven-sixteenths inch in length, below medium\r\n    in thickness, covered with short, thick pubescence, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes somewhat\r\n    acute, eglandular, thickly pubescent on both surfaces, with a\r\n    swollen ring at the base of the lobes, semi-reflexed; petals\r\n    oblong or ovate, erose, tapering abruptly into long, narrow\r\n    claws; anthers yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch in\r\n    length; pistil glabrous, equal to or shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and one-half\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish, varying to oval or ovate,\r\n    compressed, often strongly truncate at the base; cavity shallow\r\n    or medium, abrupt; suture very shallow or a line; apex roundish\r\n    or somewhat pointed; color yellowish-red becoming a light or\r\n    dark crimson over an orange-yellow ground, overspread with thin\r\n    bloom; dots very numerous, small, light russet, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem rather slender, three-quarters inch long, sparingly\r\n    pubescent; skin thick, tough, very astringent, clinging to the\r\n    pulp; flesh golden-yellow, very juicy, fibrous, tender and\r\n    melting, of medium sweetness, mild; fair to good; stone nearly\r\n    free, seven-eighths inch in size, oval, turgid, blunt-pointed,\r\n    smooth; ventral suture bluntly acute and with slight furrows;\r\n    dorsal suture acute, not furrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAMOND\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAMOND]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

It is a large,\r\nbeautifully colored, well-formed plum, tempting the palate; but one taste\r\nout of hand is a sufficiency. The flesh is coarse and the flavor not at\r\nall pleasant to one accustomed to good plums. Hogg says, in the reference\r\ngiven, that Diamond is one of the best preserving and cooking plums but\r\nin this case we doubt Hogg’s judgment unless, as may be, Diamond is much\r\nbetter in England than in America. The firm flesh and tough skin of the\r\nvariety commend it as a market plum and the trees are above the average\r\nin size, vigor, hardiness and productiveness—all characters excepting\r\nquality bespeaking the favor of plum-growers. It is planted largely for\r\nthe markets where, of course, it sells upon its appearance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Downing, this variety was raised from seed by an Englishman,\r\nin Kent, named Diamond. Kenrick and Hogg, however, state that it was\r\nraised in the nursery of a Mr. Hooker, in Kent. The London Horticultural\r\nSociety briefly described this variety in its fruit catalog for 1831 so\r\nthat its origin antedates that year. The American Pomological Society\r\nrejected Diamond for its catalog in 1858 but placed it in its fruit list\r\nin 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree above average in size and vigor, upright-spreading,\r\n    somewhat dense-topped, hardy, very productive; branches\r\n    ash-gray, roughish, with numerous, small lenticels, the bark\r\n    marked with transverse lines; branchlets of medium thickness\r\n    and length, with long internodes, greenish-red changing to dark\r\n    brownish-red, dull, somewhat pubescent, with numerous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long; upper surface\r\n    dark green, with few hairs and with a grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface pubescent; apex obtuse to acute, base acute, margin\r\n    serrate, with small, brown glands; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, slender, pubescent, reddish, with from one to four small,\r\n    globose or reniform, greenish-yellow glands on the stalk or\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early or medium, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one inch across, the buds yellow-tipped changing\r\n    to white on expanding; borne on lateral spurs, in pairs;\r\n    pedicels five-eighths inch long, somewhat slender, pubescent,\r\n    green; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate,\r\n    reflexed; petals broadly oval or roundish, entire or slightly\r\n    crenate, tapering to short, broad claws; anthers roundish,\r\n    yellow; filaments five-sixteenths inch in length; pistil\r\n    lightly pubescent at the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches by one and three-quarters inches in size, oval, slightly\r\n    necked, swollen on the ventral side, compressed; cavity\r\n    very narrow and abrupt; suture shallow, often a line; apex\r\n    roundish or pointed; color deep reddish-purple changing to\r\n    dark purplish-black at full maturity, with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one inch\r\n    long, finely pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    rather sour, separating readily; flesh pale or golden-yellow,\r\n    sometimes with a faint red tinge next the skin, not juicy,\r\n    coarse, firm but rather tender, mild subacid to nearly sweet,\r\n    not high in flavor; of fair quality; stone with a trace of red,\r\n    semi-clinging, one and one-eighth inches by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, long-oval, necked at the base, abruptly sharp-pointed\r\n    at the apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture rather broad,\r\n    lightly furrowed; dorsal suture widely grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE FLOWERING GAGE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

It was probably well known in Europe at this time for a\r\nlittle later it was mentioned by Knoop of Holland and Kraft of Austria.\r\nDuhamel described two varieties; one with small fruit which was insipid\r\nwhen over-ripe, and the other large and of good flavor. In 1846, Poiteau\r\nthought the latter was probably identical with a variety growing at\r\nLuxembourg but he did not think the former was extant. In the third\r\nedition of the London Horticultural Society’s catalog, yellow and purple\r\nforms were mentioned, showing that the variety has been represented by\r\nmore than one type. It is worthy of note that the double blossoms,\r\nexcept in strong soils, are apt to degenerate and become single. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree irregular and spreading, unproductive; branches brown\r\n    on the shaded side and blood-red on the sunny side; flowers\r\n    large, semi-double, with from twelve to eighteen petals; fruit\r\n    mid-season; large, spherical; suture shallow, sometimes a line;\r\n    flesh greenish-yellow, tender, soft, juicy, sweet, agreeably\r\n    aromatic; clingstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWNING]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

The trees are large,\r\nusually productive, not often sterile as are some of its near of kin\r\nsorts and for a southern plum the variety is remarkably hardy, never\r\nhaving suffered in Geneva from cold. The only fault that can be found\r\nwith the tree is that the foliage is quite susceptible to the shot-hole\r\nfungus. The fruit is particularly attractive with its bright, solid,\r\ngarnet-red skin, golden flesh and sweet, pleasant flavor. Unfortunately\r\nthe flesh is a little too fibrous and clings too tenaciously to the stone\r\nfor pleasant eating. Downing adds a pleasing variety to any collection of\r\nplums and in some regions ought to sell with profit to the grower for the\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nH. A. Terry of Crescent, Iowa, grew Downing from seed of the Wild Goose,\r\nwhich the originator thinks was fertilized by some Americana variety.\r\nThe Downing, however, shows no traces of Americana parentage. It is\r\nreported as originating in 1882 and first fruiting in 1885.

It is probable that the\r\ndivision of _Prunus insititia_ represented by Drap d’Or, the Mirabelle\r\nplums, will thrive in America as well as the commonly grown Damsons of\r\nthe same species. These plums certainly deserve to be far more generally\r\nplanted than they now are. It is certain from the behavior of the few\r\ntrees of the Mirabelle group now growing in New York that they have very\r\ndecided merit. Drap d’Or is probably not the best of the yellow, sweet\r\nInsititias but it is at least well worth trial.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Pomologie De La France_, this variety was cited by Merlet\r\nin 1675 and is of old and uncertain origin. Merlet placed the Mirabelle\r\nand the Drap d’Or in the Damas class, but Poiteau thought that the\r\nlatter was probably a cross between Reine Claude and Mirabelle since\r\nit resembled the former in quality and shape and the latter in color\r\nand size. Yellow Damask, Mirabelle de Nancy, Yellow Perdrigon, Gross\r\nMirabelle and others have proved to be identical with the Drap d’Or as\r\ntested in Europe. Whether all of the other synonyms mentioned are the\r\ntrue Drap d’Or is a question; their number indicates that there are many\r\nvariations in this type of the plum. The American Pomological Society\r\nplaced Drap d’Or in its catalog list in 1875 and withdrew it in 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy, productive;\r\n    branches ash-gray, with a brownish tinge, smooth, with very\r\n    few, small lenticels; branchlets of average thickness and\r\n    length, greenish-red changing to brownish-red, dull, sparingly\r\n    pubescent throughout the entire season, with few, obscure,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and length, conical,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and one-fourth inches wide, two\r\n    and one-half inches long; upper surface slightly roughened,\r\n    covered with numerous hairs, the midrib grooved; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, pubescent; apex pointed or acute, base abrupt,\r\n    margin serrate or crenate, eglandular or with small dark\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, pubescent, tinged red,\r\n    glandless or with from one to three globose, greenish-yellow\r\n    glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers fifteen-sixteenths inch across, the buds creamy\r\n    changing to white when expanded; borne in clusters on lateral\r\n    spurs, usually in pairs; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    sparingly pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    nearly glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate, somewhat reflexed; petals broadly\r\n    oval, crenate or sometimes notched at the apex, tapering\r\n    below to short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-eighth inches by one inch in\r\n    size, roundish-oval, compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, flaring; suture very shallow, often a line; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color greenish-yellow changing to\r\n    golden-yellow, somewhat mottled and blotched, occasionally with\r\n    a faint bronze blush on the exposed cheek, overspread with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, small, whitish, inconspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, sparingly pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    thin, separating readily; flesh light golden-yellow, moderately\r\n    juicy, coarse, firm but tender, sweet, mild; of good quality;\r\n    stone free, five-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval,\r\n    flattened, nearly smooth, blunt at the base and apex; ventral\r\n    suture wide, blunt, smooth; dorsal suture shallowly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUANE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

Its popularity is due to\r\nits large size, well-turned shape, royal purple color, and firm, golden\r\nflesh, characters which fit it admirably for the store and the stand.\r\nBut appearance is the only asset of the fruit so far as the consumer\r\nis concerned—the flesh is dry, tough, sour and clings to the stone,\r\nmaking a plum unfit for dessert though it does very well for culinary\r\npurposes. The fruit ripens slowly and colors a week or more before ripe;\r\nit is at its best only when fully mature. The trees excel in size, vigor\r\nand productiveness and are usually hardy and bear their crops well\r\ndistributed and not clustered as in most varieties of plums. In minor\r\ncharacters, the trees are distinguished by large leaves, pubescence on\r\nthe under side and by grayish-drab shoots covered with dense pubescence.\r\nDuane is generally found to be a very profitable market plum and if it\r\nwere only better in quality we could heartily join in recommending it.\r\n\r\nDuane originated as a seedling in the garden of James Duane, Duanesburgh,\r\nNew York, about 1820. For several years, the variety was distributed by\r\nthe Prince nurseries under the name Duane’s Purple French. This error\r\nwas caused by Judge Duane’s accidentally sending William Prince, of\r\nFlushing, grafts of this seedling instead of a French plum[210] which he\r\nhad imported in 1820. When this mistake was discovered by Downing and\r\nTomlinson about 1846, the word French was dropped and the plum became\r\nknown as Duane’s Purple and later, according to the rules of the American\r\nPomological Society, as Duane. In 1856, it was listed by the American\r\nPomological Society as promising well and in 1862 it was placed on the\r\nlist of the fruit catalog.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round and dense-topped, hardy and\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, smooth except for the numerous\r\n    small, raised lenticels; branchlets medium to thick, variable\r\n    in length, with short internodes, greenish-red changing to dark\r\n    brownish-drab, dull, thickly pubescent, with raised lenticels\r\n    intermediate in number and size; leaf-buds of average size and\r\n    length, conical or pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate or oval, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, three and one-half inches long; upper surface\r\n    dark green, pubescent, rugose, with a narrow groove on the\r\n    midrib; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex acute,\r\n    base cuneate, margin serrate, eglandular or with small amber\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, pubescent, tinged with red,\r\n    eglandular or with one or two small, globose, greenish-brown\r\n    glands on the stalk or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season rather early, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing before the leaves, one inch across, white; developing\r\n    from lateral buds, singly or in pairs; pedicels nine-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, erect; petals roundish,\r\n    entire, short-clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments one-quarter\r\n    inch long; pistil pubescent on the ovary, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period of average length; one and\r\n    three-quarters inches by one and five-eighths inches in size,\r\n    broadly oblong-oval or obovate, compressed, halves unequal;\r\n    cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture variable in depth; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color dark reddish-purple changing to\r\n    purplish-black on the sunny side, overspread with thick bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, light russet; stem three-quarters inch long,\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin below medium in\r\n    thickness, tough, sour, separating readily; flesh pale yellow,\r\n    lacking in juice, firm, sour unless fully ripe; of fair\r\n    quality; stone adhering, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, oval, with pitted surfaces, blunt at the base and\r\n    apex; ventral suture wide, blunt; dorsal suture with a broad,\r\n    deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLIEST OF ALL\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

While it appears to be a very\r\ngood plum in most respects as it grows on the Station grounds, being\r\nattractive in appearance, of good flavor, a freestone and firm enough\r\nto ship well, it surpasses in none of these characters and the fruit is\r\nso small as to make it a poor competitor among the purple plums of its\r\nseason. It does not deserve the reputation in America that pomologists\r\nhave given it in Europe. In France the Early Orleans, under the name of\r\nPrune du Roi, is used in prune-making but it seems not to have been so\r\nused in America.\r\n\r\nEarly Orleans is old and of unknown origin. Duhamel in 1768 considered\r\nit a variety of the Orleans, differing only in the time of ripening but\r\nthere are additional differences as can be seen in the descriptions of\r\nthe two. It is true, however, that these two plums are very similar.\r\nAccording to Kenrick, Wilmot’s New Early Orleans was raised by John\r\nWilmot, an Englishman. Though it may be of separate origin it is\r\npractically identical with the Early Orleans.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, upright-spreading, hardy, productive; branches\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, with small, inconspicuous, oval lenticels;\r\n    branchlets thick, with rather short internodes, covered with\r\n    thin bloom and marked with scarf-skin, dull brownish-drab,\r\n    pubescent, with a medium number of small, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds intermediate in size and length, conical, free,\r\n    plump; leaf-scars enlarged.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, two and one-quarter inches wide, four\r\n    inches long, roundish-oval or obovate, thick; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed, base acute, margin crenate and with small, dark\r\n    glands; upper surface light green, sparingly pubescent and\r\n    with a grooved midrib; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent;\r\n    petiole three-quarters inch long, thick, pubescent, faintly\r\n    tinged red, with from one to three large, globose glands mostly\r\n    on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, nearly one-half inch across, white,\r\n    the buds yellow-tipped as they unfold; borne in clusters on\r\n    short lateral spurs, in pairs; pedicels one-half inch long,\r\n    thick, pubescent, green; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate,\r\n    thinly pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, glandular,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, reflexed; petals roundish, entire,\r\n    not clawed; filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\nFruit early, season short; one and one-quarter inches in diameter,\r\nroundish-oval, slightly truncate, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\nabrupt; suture shallow or a line; apex roundish to flattened or sometimes\r\ndepressed, often oblique; color dark reddish-purple, covered with thick\r\nbloom; dots numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem of average\r\nthickness, five-eighths inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit;\r\nskin thin, tough, not astringent, separating readily; flesh lemon-yellow,\r\njuicy, coarse, firm, sweet, mild but pleasant; very good; stone free,\r\nthree-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval, slightly oblique,\r\nblunt-pointed, with rough and slightly honeycombed surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY RIVERS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

In New\r\nYork, however, the plums are so small and drop so badly as they ripen\r\nthat the variety is worthless for commercial purposes. Hogg, in the\r\nreference given above, notes the following peculiarity of the trees of\r\nthis variety: “The original tree throws up suckers, which, when removed\r\nand planted out, do not bloom for several years; but scions taken from\r\nthe original tree and grafted, bloom the second year. A curious fact is\r\nthat the grafted trees fruit abundantly, and the branches are so brittle\r\nthey break off; in those raised from suckers the branches never break.\r\nThe grafted trees in spring are full of bloom, sparing of shoots, and\r\nvery few leaves; the suckers are more vigorous in growth, have no bloom,\r\nbut an abundance of foliage, even when six years old.” This variety is\r\na seedling of Early Tours raised by Thomas Rivers of Sawbridgeworth,\r\nEngland, about 1834. It was first disseminated under the names Early\r\nProlific and Rivers’ Early No. 2 but, in 1866, Hogg with the permission\r\nof the originator, renamed it Early Rivers under which name it is now\r\ngenerally known.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, round-topped, productive;\r\n    branchlets thick, short, pubescent throughout the season;\r\n    leaves roundish-oval or obovate, one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, nearly three inches long, leathery; margin crenate or\r\n    serrate, with few, small, dark glands; petiole pubescent, with\r\n    from one to three small glands usually on the stalk; blooming\r\n    season intermediate, short; flowers appearing after the leaves,\r\n    seven-eighths inch across; borne on lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    singly or in twos; petals roundish.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and one-quarter inches by one\r\n    and one-eighth inches in size, roundish-oval or ovate, dark\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; flesh dull yellow,\r\n    firm, sweet, mild, pleasant; of good quality; stone semi-free,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, rather flat,\r\n    oval, with rough and pitted surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ROYAL\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

This sort is worthy of more extensive\r\ntrial than it has yet had in America. Early Royal is a French variety\r\nintroduced by M. Noisette of Paris, about 1830. Thompson made the first\r\ncomplete description of the variety in 1839 from the fruits of a tree in\r\nthe gardens of the London Horticultural Society. Although recommended in\r\nthe catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1862 it has not been\r\nextensively planted in this country.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, rather open, productive;\r\n    branches and trunk roughish; branchlets thickly pubescent;\r\n    leaf-scars enlarged; leaves folded upward, oval or obovate, one\r\n    and three-quarters inches wide, three and three-eighths inches\r\n    long; margin serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole thickly\r\n    pubescent, with one or two smallish glands; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time and length; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, white, tinged yellow at the apex of\r\n    the petals; borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; about one and\r\n    three-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-ovate, dark\r\n    reddish-purple, marked by irregular russet streaks, covered\r\n    with thick bloom; dots conspicuous; stem thick, pubescent;\r\n    flesh greenish-yellow, rather dry, firm, very sweet, mild,\r\n    pleasant flavor; very good; stone nearly free, three-quarters\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, roundish-oval, blunt at the\r\n    apex and base, with but slightly roughened surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture prominent and with short wing; dorsal suture with a\r\n    wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY TOURS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

Following Duhamel many horticultural authorities\r\ncontinued to separate the varieties, but Downing, Floy-Lindley and\r\nMathieu give Damas de Tours as a synonym of Early Tours, and Thompson,\r\nHogg, Downing, Mathieu and the _Guide Pratique_ give Noire Hative as a\r\nsynonym, while Prince holds Prune Noire Hative to be synonymous.\r\n\r\nWith this great similarity in the names and descriptions, it seems\r\ndoubtful if these are separate varieties, but not having the fruit of the\r\nthree to compare, it has been thought best in _The Plums of New York_ to\r\nfollow the nomenclature of the oldest authorities. Several writers have\r\nalso named the Blue Perdrigon and the Perdrigon Violet as identical with\r\nEarly Tours but neither can be, as all descriptions indicate that both\r\nare at least a month later in ripening than the variety under discussion.\r\n\r\nEarly Tours is considered in continental Europe one of the best early\r\nplums for dessert. It is said when fully ripened to be a veritable\r\nsweetmeat. As the variety grows in the Station collection it can hardly\r\nbe lauded as highly as in Europe. Yet it is at least worthy of a place in\r\na home orchard as a delicious early plum.\r\n\r\n    Tree intermediate in size, upright-spreading, rather\r\n    open-topped, productive; branchlets thickish, pubescent;\r\n    leaves falling early, folded upward, obovate or oval, one\r\n    and seven-eighths inches wide, three and one-quarter inches\r\n    long; margin crenate; petiole pubescent, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three glands usually on the stalk; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time and length; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one and one-eighth inches across; borne on lateral\r\n    spurs or from lateral buds.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early; one and one-quarter inches by one and\r\n    one-eighth inches in size, slightly oval, dark purplish-black,\r\n    covered with thick bloom; skin thick, tough, sour; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, firm, sweet, pleasant flavored; good to very\r\n    good; stone semi-free, three-quarters inch by one-half-inch in\r\n    size, irregular oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY YELLOW\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

Because of its synonyms it is thought to\r\nhave originated in Spain whence it was gradually taken northward, crossed\r\nthe boundary and spread through the fertile valleys of France. Early in\r\nthe Seventeenth Century it was firmly established in England and was\r\ndescribed by Tradescant and Parkinson. From that time till the present\r\nit has kept a place in European and American horticulture, in spite of\r\nthe introduction of hundreds of improved varieties. It is described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Tree hardy, moderately vigorous and productive; branches\r\n    long, slender, upright until bent down with fruit; branchlets\r\n    pubescent. Fruit very early, small, obovate; stem short,\r\n    slender; color pale yellow, with thin bloom; flesh yellow,\r\n    tender, sweet, moderately juicy, pleasant; good; freestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPIRE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

It is attractive in appearance, pleasant in flavor and\r\ngives promise of shipping well. Wherever the variety proves productive,\r\nas it is to a fair degree on the grounds of the Station, this plum might\r\nwell be grown. Empire was grown by Ezra Rood, Cortland, New York, about\r\n1875, from seed purchased at the State Fair. In 1890, E. Smith & Sons\r\nof Geneva found this plum in Mr. Rood’s yard and procured cions of it,\r\nafterwards introducing the variety under the name Rood. The year that\r\nthey made the discovery, John Hammond, also of Geneva, found the same\r\nvariety at another place in Cortland and secured cions from which he\r\nsubsequently disseminated the plum under the name Empire, by which it is\r\nnow generally known.\r\n\r\n    Tree intermediate in size and vigor, spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; branches covered with short, thick, fruit-spurs;\r\n    branchlets short and stubby, pubescent throughout the season;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent; leaves folded upward, oval or obovate,\r\n    one and one-half inches wide, three and one-quarter inches\r\n    long, thick, stiff; margin crenate, eglandular or with small\r\n    dark glands; petiole thick, reddish, with a few large, globose\r\n    or reniform glands; blooming season intermediate in time and\r\n    length; flowers appearing after the leaves, over one inch\r\n    across, yellowish-white; borne singly or in twos.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period very long; about one and\r\n    five-eighths inches in diameter, round, dark reddish-purple,\r\n    covered with medium thick bloom; dots numerous, conspicuous;\r\n    stem thick, surrounded by a fleshy ring at the cavity; skin\r\n    sour; flesh golden-yellow, dry, firm but tender, sweet, mild,\r\n    pleasant in flavor; of good quality; stone nearly free,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by three-quarters inch in size, oval,\r\n    turgid, with roughened surfaces; ventral suture broad, with\r\n    short but distinct wing; dorsal suture wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLEBERT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLEBERT]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =10=:71. 1855. =2.= Downing _Fr.

Prince Engelbert 10, 13. _Prince Englebert_ 15, 16. _Prinz\r\n    Engelbert_ 11.\r\n\r\nIn common parlance Englebert is a prune, its origin, shape, color and\r\nfirm golden-yellow flesh all marking it as such, but in prune-making\r\nregions it is usually marketed in the green state, if grown at all, and\r\nis little used in curing. It cannot be said to be much more popular as a\r\nplum than it is as a prune, chiefly because it is not of high quality,\r\nbut also because it is none too attractive in color, size or shape,\r\ncutting a rather poor figure in comparison with a great number of other\r\nDomestica plums. The variety fails in tree as well as in fruit. The trees\r\nare variable in size, suffer from cold in exposed situations and while\r\nrather productive bear their crops in clusters hard to pick and well\r\nplaced to insure infection from brown-rot when that disease is epidemic.\r\nFor some reason the fruit of this variety shrivels at this Station not\r\nonly after being picked, but while still on the tree. In New York,\r\nEnglebert has been thoroughly tested, has been found wanting and is not\r\nnow recommended.\r\n\r\nThis variety was obtained from a seed of the “Date Prune,” by M.\r\nScheidweiler, Professor of Botany at Ghent, Belgium.[211] The date\r\nof origin has not been given, but it was probably produced about the\r\nmiddle of the last century since it was described as a new fruit in\r\nthe _Horticulturist_ for 1855. Englebert was added to the American\r\nPomological Society catalog fruit list in 1871 under the name Prince\r\nEnglebert, but in 1897, according to the rules of the Society, the name\r\nwas simplified to Englebert.\r\n\r\n    Tree variable in size, vasiform, dense-topped, hardy except\r\n    in exposed locations, productive; branches ash-gray, smooth\r\n    except for the numerous, long-oval, raised lenticels;\r\n    branchlets thick, rather short, with internodes above medium\r\n    in length, green changing to dark brownish-drab, dull, heavily\r\n    pubescent throughout the season, with few, inconspicuous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval or obovate, one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long; upper\r\n    surface covered with very fine hairs, with a shallow groove\r\n    on the midrib; lower surface pale green, finely pubescent;\r\n    apex roundish-pointed, base obtuse, margin finely crenate,\r\n    eglandular or with small dark glands; petiole three-quarters\r\n    inch long, pubescent, faintly tinged red, glandless or with one\r\n    or two small, globose, greenish-yellow glands at the base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early to medium, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, about one inch across, white except\r\n    for a yellowish tinge near the apex of the petals; borne in\r\n    clusters on lateral buds and spurs, usually in pairs; pedicels\r\n    one-half inch long, below medium in thickness, pubescent,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes\r\n    obtuse, sparingly pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate\r\n    and with marginal hairs; petals broadly oval or roundish,\r\n    crenate, abruptly tipped with short, broad claws; stamens often\r\n    inclined to revert to petals; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one and three-eighths inches in size; oval, swollen\r\n    on the suture side, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    abrupt; suture a line; apex bluntly pointed or roundish;\r\n    color dark purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, russet; stem three-quarters inch long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, sourish, separating\r\n    readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, coarse, rather firm,\r\n    sweet, pleasant-flavored, sprightly; good; stone one and\r\n    one-eighth inches by five-eighths inch in size, oval or broadly\r\n    ovate, strongly flattened, with roughened and deeply pitted\r\n    surfaces, blunt at the base and apex; ventral suture narrow,\r\n    strongly grooved, not prominent; dorsal suture acute, with a\r\n    shallow, often indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGRE\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Normand _Cat._ 1891. =2.= Kerr _Cat._ 1894-1900. =3.=\r\n    Cornell _Sta.

Almost nothing is known regarding\r\nthe history and origin of Engre. It was first mentioned in 1890 in the\r\ncatalog of J. L.

But the fruits are small and\r\nthe tree-characters are not such that the variety can compete with the\r\nstandard Reine Claude plums. Esperen was produced from seed in 1830 by\r\nMajor Esperen of Malines, Belgium; it was first fruited in 1844, and was\r\nintroduced in 1847 by Louis Van Houtte of Ghent, Belgium. It obtained the\r\ndesignation Drap d’Or from its close resemblance to that variety.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, productive; trunk\r\n    stocky, rough; branches rough, with numerous, large, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets brash; leaves flattened, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, five inches long, obovate or oval; margin serrate;\r\n    petiole thick, tinged red, pubescent, with from two to five\r\n    large, globose glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; about one and one-half inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oval; cavity shallow, narrow, often lipped; color\r\n    yellow streaked and mottled with green, overspread with thin\r\n    bloom; skin thin, tender, rather sour; flesh yellow, tender,\r\n    sweet, aromatic; of good quality; stone free, one inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, oval, with pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture blunt; dorsal suture wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCELSIOR\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Glen St. Mary Cat._ 1891-2. =2.= _Am.

The variety was originated by G. L. Tabor, Glen Saint Mary,\r\nFlorida, in 1887, from seed of Kelsey supposed to have been pollinated by\r\nWild Goose, although some authorities believe De Caradeuc to have been\r\nthe male parent. It seems to be a promising variety and was mentioned in\r\nthe last three catalogs of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, vasiform; branches slender; leaves of medium size, narrow;\r\nmargin finely crenulate, glandular; petiole short, with from one to three\r\nsmall glands; flowers small, scattered; fruit early; of medium size,\r\nroundish, dark red with heavy bloom; skin tough; flesh firm, yellowish\r\nwith red tinge towards the center; quality good; stone of medium size,\r\ncompressed, clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Differences which distinguish the fruits of the\r\ntwo are: The Field is a trifle smaller, the fruit is more nearly round,\r\nlacking the prolonged neck of Bradshaw and is more plump at the base,\r\nthe parent plum being markedly obovate; Field is earlier than Bradshaw,\r\nthe latter difference accounting for the synonym, “Early Bradshaw.” The\r\nquality is not such as to commend either of these plums, but of the two\r\nField is slightly the better. In tree-characters, Bradshaw excels in\r\nhaving a larger tree and in being more productive. The foliage of Field\r\nis very good, it ripens its wood well and begins to bear while young,\r\nbut it is inclined to a biennial bearing habit which makes the average\r\nin quantity of fruit a little too low for a market plum which Field is,\r\nif worth planting at all. A good quality of this variety is that it\r\nwithstands the brown-rot very well. It is doubtful if Field is worthy\r\nof a place in the fruit-growing regions of New York, unless, perhaps,\r\nwhere a plum of the Bradshaw type, but a little earlier, is wanted. Like\r\nBradshaw, Field is comparatively little attacked by San José scale.\r\n\r\nField is a seedling of Bradshaw grown in Schoharie County, New York. It\r\nwas first noted by S. D. Willard of Geneva, New York, in 1889, as “a\r\nvariety worthy of cultivation.”\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    hardy, productive; branches ash-gray, smooth except for the\r\n    numerous, small, raised lenticels; branchlets slender, short,\r\n    with internodes of medium length, greenish-red changing to\r\n    brownish-drab, with a trace of red, dull, pubescent becoming\r\n    slightly less so at maturity, with numerous, inconspicuous,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds below medium in size, short, obtuse,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate, two and one-sixteenth inches\r\n    wide, four and three-eighths inches long; upper surface dark\r\n    green, nearly glabrous, with shallowly grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface sparingly pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base acute,\r\n    margin serrate, with a few, smallish, black glands; petiole\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, thick, tinged with red, sparingly\r\n    pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one inch across, white, with a yellowish\r\n    tinge at the apex of the petals; scattered on lateral buds\r\n    and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch\r\n    long, thick, with few, short, scattering hairs, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes above\r\n    medium in width, obtuse, slightly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, somewhat reflexed; petals broadly oval,\r\n    entire, tapering below to short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, period of ripening short; one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches by one and five-eighths inches in size,\r\n    oblong-oval, compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, broad; apex roundish; color\r\n    dark purplish-red, overspread with very thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, clustered about the apex; stem\r\n    three-quarters inch long, sparingly pubescent, adhering well to\r\n    the fruit; skin thin, slightly sour, separating readily; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, medium juicy, sweetish, mild; of fair quality;\r\n    stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths inch in size, ovate\r\n    with roughened and deeply pitted surfaces, blunt at the apex\r\n    and base; ventral suture broad, distinctly furrowed; dorsal\r\n    suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST GARDEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST GARDEN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Minn.

This variety is little grown in the\r\nEast, but it is widely distributed in the central West where both in\r\ntree and fruit-characters it seems adapted to the needs of the climate\r\nand soil. It is one of the latest of its group, maturing at a good time\r\nfor shipping, for which it is further adapted by its tough skin and firm\r\nflesh. While Forest Garden is not preeminently a dessert plum, it has a\r\nspicy flavor that makes it pleasant eating and it is admirably adapted\r\nfor culinary purposes, especially for preserving.\r\n\r\nThis variety is from a wild plum found in the woods bordering on the\r\nCedar River, near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, by Thomas Hare, and introduced by\r\nH. C. Raymond, of the Forest Garden Nurseries, Council Bluffs, Iowa,\r\nabout 1862. The American Pomological Society placed the variety on its\r\nfruit catalog list in 1883, dropped it in 1891, and replaced it in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, often very vigorous, spreading, with\r\n    sprawling habit, inclined to be flat-topped, perfectly\r\n    hardy, variable in productiveness, bearing young, somewhat\r\n    susceptible to shot-hole fungus; trunk small in proportion to\r\n    the size of the tree, shaggy; branches rather rough, zigzag\r\n    and inclined to split, thorny, dark ash-brown, with numerous,\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets thick, long, willowy, with short\r\n    internodes, greenish changing to dark chestnut-red, glossy,\r\n    with thin pubescence when young, which disappears in autumn,\r\n    with conspicuous, numerous raised lenticels; leaf-buds small,\r\n    short, obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, elongated-oval, or\r\n    obovate, peach-like, one and three-quarters inches wide,\r\n    four and one-quarter inches long, thin and leathery; upper\r\n    surface smooth, with a shallow, grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base\r\n    somewhat abrupt, margin doubly crenate, glandular; petiole\r\n    three-quarters inch long, sparingly pubescent, faintly tinged\r\n    with red, usually with two conspicuous, globose, brownish\r\n    glands below the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves; seven-eighths inch across, white, with a strong,\r\n    disagreeable odor; borne in dense but scattering clusters\r\n    on lateral buds and spurs, in threes or in fours; pedicels\r\n    nine-sixteenths inch in length, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, narrowly campanulate or obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, slightly pubescent, margined with\r\n    few hairs and with dark-colored glands, slightly reflexed;\r\n    petals oval, erose, tapering to long claws of medium width;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments seven-sixteenths inch in length;\r\n    pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit variable in season which is usually late and short;\r\n    about one and one-eighth inches in diameter, rather large,\r\n    roundish-ovate or nearly oval, slightly compressed, halves\r\n    equal; cavity shallow, wide, flaring; suture a line; apex\r\n    roundish or somewhat pointed; color light or dark red, with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, russet, conspicuous; stem slender,\r\n    five-eighths inch long, glabrous, detaching from the fruit at\r\n    maturity; skin thick, tough, slightly astringent, adhering;\r\n    flesh dark golden-yellow, juicy, coarse, fibrous, melting,\r\n    sweetish next the skin but rather sour toward the center,\r\n    with a strong and peculiar flavor, aromatic; fair to good;\r\n    stone clinging, three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, oval, turgid, blunt and slightly flattened at the base,\r\n    ending in an abrupt but sharp point at the apex, nearly smooth;\r\n    ventral suture narrow, faintly ridged; dorsal suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST ROSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST ROSE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Forest Rose, however, is not as\r\nattractive in color as the other variety, the difference not being well\r\nbrought out in the color-plates, is smaller and does not keep nor ship\r\nquite as well. The variety under discussion is better in quality than\r\nForest Garden and better adapted than the last named variety for the\r\nhome orchard at least. While somewhat variable in productiveness, in most\r\nlocalities it bears annually and abundantly. The trees are rather more\r\nthorny than most of its species.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said by H. A. Terry of Crescent, Iowa, to be a seedling\r\nof Miner, grown by Scott & Company, a Missouri nursery firm, and\r\nintroduced by William Stark, Louisiana, Missouri, in 1878. Terry offers\r\nno evidence to show that this plum is a seedling of Miner and there is a\r\nquestion as to whether more is really known of its parentage other than\r\nthat it came from Missouri.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, intermediate in vigor, upright-spreading,\r\n    open-topped, hardy, variable in productiveness somewhat\r\n    susceptible to attacks of shot-hole fungus; trunk very rough\r\n    and shaggy; branches rough, thorny, dark ash-gray, with\r\n    numerous lenticels; branchlets numerous, slender, variable in\r\n    length, with internodes of medium length, green changing to\r\n    dull reddish-brown, glossy, glabrous, with numerous, small,\r\n    raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, elongated-oval or obovate,\r\n    one and one-half inches wide, four inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface dull red in the fall, rugose, glabrous, with the\r\n    midrib and larger veins deeply grooved; lower surface light\r\n    green, somewhat pubescent along the midrib; apex acuminate,\r\n    base acute, margin crenate or serrate, with small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole slender, five-eighths inch in length, sparsely\r\n    pubescent along one side, tinged with red, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three small, globose or oval, greenish-brown glands\r\n    on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers seven-eighths inch across, white, with a disagreeable\r\n    odor; borne in dense clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in\r\n    pairs or in threes; pedicels five-eighths inch long, below\r\n    medium in thickness, glabrous, greenish: calyx-tube green,\r\n    narrowly campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes short and narrow,\r\n    acute, serrate, somewhat reflexed, glabrous on the outer\r\n    surface, but more or less pubescent on the inner surface and\r\n    along the margin, which is strewn with red glands; petals oval,\r\n    dentate, tapering below into narrow, lightly pubescent claws of\r\n    medium length; anthers light yellow; filaments one-half inch in\r\n    length; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and one-eighth inches by one inch\r\n    in size, roundish-oval; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring; suture\r\n    a line; apex roundish; color dull crimson overspread with thin\r\n    bloom; dots very numerous, small, gray, conspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, three-quarters inch long, smooth, not adhering to the\r\n    fruit; skin thick, tough, astringent, inclined to crack under\r\n    unfavorable conditions, adhering; flesh dull apricot-yellow,\r\n    juicy, fibrous, tender and melting, sweet next to the skin but\r\n    tart toward the center, aromatic; fair to good; stone clinging,\r\n    five-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval, acute at the\r\n    apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture somewhat blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOTHERINGHAM\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n1.

Although but little if at all grown in this country, it has\r\nmaintained its place among standard English varieties for at least two\r\nand a half centuries. The exact time of its origin is not certain, but\r\nit was undoubtedly during the first half of the Seventeenth Century as\r\nHogg records a reference made to it by Rea in 1665. It was first grown\r\nextensively at Sheen, in Surrey, England, about 1700 by Sir William\r\nTemple, who gave it the name Sheen. The variety is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tree hardy, vigorous, productive.

It is certainly a desirable plum for any\r\nhome plantation, and if it proves as productive elsewhere as about\r\nGeneva, it may well be worth growing in commercial orchards.\r\n\r\nFreeman is a chance seedling found in the yard of a Mr. Freeman of\r\nCortland, New York, about 1890 and shortly afterwards introduced by\r\nE.

It is so inferior to varieties of its\r\nspecies in several particulars as to have little value for commercial\r\nplanting. The fruits are smaller and the pits larger in proportion to\r\nthe amount of flesh than with several better known Damsons and the trees\r\ndo not bear as large crops as plums of this species should; these faults\r\nof fruit and tree condemn the plum. To offset the defects in the tree,\r\nfreedom from black-knot and immunity to leaf-blight may be mentioned as\r\ncompensating somewhat. Still Freestone is hardly to be mentioned as worth\r\nplanting in either home or commercial orchard. The origin of this Damson\r\nis unknown. Stark Brothers, Louisiana, Missouri, who introduced the\r\nvariety about 1889, describe it as “a selected sort which is very hardy,\r\nfree from insects, and productive.”\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, vasiform,\r\n    hardy, not always productive; branches dark ash-gray, thorny;\r\n    leaves folded upward, oval, one and one-quarter inches wide,\r\n    two and one-quarter inches long; upper surface dark green,\r\n    rugose; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; margin finely\r\n    serrate, eglandular or with small, brownish glands; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, glandless or with one or two small\r\n    glands; blooming season late and of medium length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, the buds\r\n    creamy, changing to white when expanded; borne in clusters on\r\n    lateral buds and spurs, usually in pairs; anthers reddish;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil shorter than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; seven-eighths inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oval; cavity very shallow and narrow; flesh\r\n    yellowish-green, juicy, tender, sweet, mild; fair in quality;\r\n    stone free, tinged red, five-eighths inch by one-half inch in\r\n    size, oval, turgid, with roughened surfaces, acute at the base,\r\n    blunt at the apex; ventral suture broad, blunt; dorsal suture\r\n    with a broad, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH]\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

French Damson 1, 2, 3.\r\n\r\nFar better than the Freestone just discussed is the French Damson, which\r\nin some respects surpasses all other plums in its group. Thus it is the\r\nlargest of the Damsons, so large, indeed, as to lead many to believe\r\nthat it may be a hybrid with some Domestica plum, the size of the trees,\r\nblossoms and foliage also leading to such a supposition. This excellent\r\nDamson is largely grown for the market in western New York, good quality\r\nas well as size and appearance aiding in selling the product. The fruits\r\nhave but one defect, the pit is large for the amount of flesh. Curiously\r\nenough in some seasons the stone clings and in others is perfectly free.\r\nIt is in tree-characters that the French plum best shows its superiority\r\nover other Damsons. The trees are large, the largest of the Damsons in\r\nNew York, hardy, bear abundantly and annually and carry their foliage so\r\nwell that fruit and wood usually ripen perfectly even when the trees are\r\nnot sprayed. The season is a little after that of the more commonly grown\r\nShropshire, which in most years is an advantage. French, while becoming\r\npopular, is still too little known in New York, where its behavior\r\nwarrants quite general planting.\r\n\r\nS. D. Willard, a nurseryman of Geneva, New York, probably introduced\r\nFrench in this country; at least it was brought to notice mainly through\r\nhis recommendation. The origin is unknown, but it is probably an\r\nintroduction from France and may be an old variety renamed. The figure\r\nof Prune Petit Damas Violet given by Poiteau is so very similar as to\r\nsuggest that French may be identical with that sort.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches numerous, ash-gray, roughish, thorny,\r\n    with lenticels variable in size; branchlets inclined to\r\n    develop spurs at the base, rather slender, short, with short\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to dark brownish-drab, dull,\r\n    somewhat zigzag, thickly pubescent, with inconspicuous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds intermediate in size and length, pointed,\r\n    free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, long-oval, one and one-quarter inches\r\n    wide, three inches long; upper surface dark green, covered\r\n    with fine hairs, with a grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base abrupt, margin serrate\r\n    or nearly crenate, with a few, small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    eleven-sixteenths inch long, rather slender, pubescent, faintly\r\n    tinged with red, usually having two very small, globose,\r\n    greenish-brown glands on the stalk or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and five-sixteenths inches\r\n    across, white; borne on lateral spurs, usually in pairs;\r\n    pedicels five-eighths inch long, slender, covered with short\r\n    pubescence, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, glabrous on the outer surface,\r\n    thinly pubescent along the margin and at the base of the inner\r\n    surface, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals oval, dentate\r\n    or fringed, tapering below to short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    distinctly reddish; filaments seven-sixteenths inch in length;\r\n    pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; one and one-half inches by one and one-eighth\r\n    inches in diameter, ovate, halves equal; cavity very shallow,\r\n    narrow, flaring; suture a line; apex roundish; color dull\r\n    black, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    brownish, inconspicuous; stem slender, three-quarters inch\r\n    long, sparingly pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    thin, tough, separating readily; flesh greenish, juicy,\r\n    fibrous, tender, sweet, pleasant and sprightly; good; stone\r\n    variable in adhesion, seven-eighths inch by one-half inch in\r\n    size, oval, roughened, acute at the base, blunt at the apex;\r\n    ventral suture rather narrow, heavily furrowed and somewhat\r\n    winged; dorsal suture with a shallow groove of medium width.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROGMORE\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Flor. & Pom._ 265, Pl. 1876. =2.= _Mich.

Frogmore Prolific Damson 3.\r\n\r\nFrogmore may be considered among the best of the Damsons in quality for\r\nthe culinary purposes to which this fruit is commonly put. The flesh is\r\ntender, sweet and good, but adheres rather too tightly to the stone.\r\nThe tree of Frogmore is all that could be desired in productiveness and\r\nquite equals most other Damsons in general and probably surpasses them\r\nall, at least on the grounds at this Station, in length of time that the\r\nfruit hangs on the tree. The habit of growth of this variety varies from\r\nthat of _Prunus insititia_ as commonly found, the leaves being larger,\r\nthe tops more spreading and the branches less thorny. The variety has\r\nhardly been tried enough in New York to warrant either recommending or\r\ncondemning it. According to the _Florist and Pomologist_, published\r\nin 1876, this variety originated a few years previous to the date of\r\npublication in the Royal Gardens at Frogmore, England.\r\n\r\n    Tree inferior in size and vigor, round-topped, open, hardy,\r\n    very productive; branches thorny, the bark on the older\r\n    branches splitting transversely to the direction of growth,\r\n    making grooves or rings about three inches apart and two\r\n    inches or more in length; branchlets slender, almost glabrous\r\n    throughout the season, covered with light bloom; leaves bright\r\n    red on first opening, somewhat folded backward, obovate, one\r\n    and three-eighths inches wide, three and one-half inches long;\r\n    upper surface dark green, rugose; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    pubescent, margin eglandular; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, slender, greenish, glandless or with one or two small,\r\n    globose, yellowish-green glands usually at the base of the\r\n    leaf; blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one inch across, white, in\r\n    scattered clusters on lateral spurs; borne singly or in pairs;\r\n    anthers yellow with tinge of red; filaments five-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season of medium length; one and one-eighth inches\r\n    by one inch in size, roundish-oval, compressed, purplish-black,\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; flesh golden-yellow, juicy,\r\n    tender, sweet; good; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, oval, smooth, somewhat acute at the base\r\n    and apex; ventral suture blunt or with a short, narrow wing;\r\n    dorsal suture with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST GAGE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

Downing in 1838 traced the history of this\r\nvariety to a tree standing on the farm of a Mr. Duboise, Dutchess County,\r\nNew York, Mr. Duboise stating that the original had been planted by his\r\nfather. It is doubtful if this is the first tree, however, for in 1849\r\nCharles Hamilton of Canterbury, Orange County, reported trees of Frost\r\nGage thirty to forty years old on his place.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright, very productive; branchlets\r\n    thick; leaves flattened, oval or obovate, one and one-half\r\n    inches wide, two and three-quarters inches long; margin crenate\r\n    or serrate, with few, small, black glands; petiole short,\r\n    usually with one or two glands; blooming season intermediate,\r\n    short; flowers appearing after the leaves, white, with a little\r\n    yellowish tinge; borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    twos.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; about one and one-eighth inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish, dark purplish-black, covered with thick bloom; stem\r\n    slender, persistent; skin tough, sour; flesh greenish-yellow,\r\n    juicy, firm, sweet, mild; fair to good; stone clinging, small,\r\n    irregular-ovate, somewhat oblique.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURST\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Mas _Le Verger_ =6=:45. 1873. =2.= Lange _Allgem.

The two fruits differ only in season, the Furst being a\r\nfew days earlier, and in the tendency of the variety under discussion\r\nto shrivel about the neck. It may be that Furst will succeed in some\r\nlocalities where the Italian Prune is not a success.\r\n\r\nFurst was propagated by the Baron of Trauttenberg, Prague, Bohemia, who\r\nhad received it from Professor Pater Hackl, Leitmeritz, Bohemia, under\r\nthe name Furst, given in honor of Eugene Furst, son of the founder of\r\nthe School of Horticulture of Frauendorf, Bavaria. Furst Damson has\r\nbeen confused with this variety, but it is a different plum. Its fruits\r\nare distinctly necked and much inferior in quality, and its shoots\r\nare glabrous, while in this variety they are not. The United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture introduced Furst in 1901 and through them this\r\nStation received cions for testing.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, round-topped, productive; branchlets\r\n    thick, marked with slight scarf-skin; leaf-scars very\r\n    prominent; leaves folded upward, obovate, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, four and one-half inches long; margin doubly\r\n    serrate or almost crenate, eglandular or with small dark\r\n    glands; petiole thick, pubescent, glandless or with from one\r\n    to three globose glands usually on the stalk; blooming season\r\n    late; flowers one and one-eighth inches across, white, the\r\n    opening buds tipped with yellow; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in twos.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; one and seven-eighths inches by one and one-half\r\n    inches in size, oval, slightly necked, purplish-black, covered\r\n    with thick bloom; dots numerous, reddish, conspicuous; stem\r\n    thick; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, very fibrous, firm,\r\n    sweet, mild, with pleasant aroma; good to very good; stone one\r\n    and one-eighths inches by five-eighths inch in size, free,\r\n    irregular-oval, with rather long, tapering, oblique apex,\r\n    the surfaces heavily pitted; ventral suture prominent, often\r\n    winged; dorsal suture wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGESON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGESON]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

The rich yellow color of the\r\nfruit makes this a particularly handsome plum, but here praises end. The\r\nflesh is so astringent and clings so tenaciously to the stone as to unfit\r\nthe variety for either dessert or culinary use. Moreover, the fruits are\r\nexceedingly variable in color, size and shape, in the last character\r\nranging from flattish to round, with sometimes round and sometimes\r\npointed apex. The tree has too much of the sprawling habit of Burbank\r\nto make it a good orchard plant. This plum, and those that have been\r\nconfused with it, can be spared without great loss to American pomology.\r\n\r\nGeorgeson was imported by H. H. Berger & Company, San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia, and brought to notice chiefly by J. L. Normand, Marksville,\r\nLouisiana, who named it for Professor C. C. Georgeson, then of Manhattan,\r\nKansas, a student of Japanese fruits. In the Georgia Horticultural\r\nSociety Report for 1889, L. A. Berckmans mentions two types of Hattankio,\r\none of which may be this variety. Normand, in 1891, said that he received\r\ntwo varieties of Hattonkin from different sources and in order to\r\nseparate them he numbered the earlier, No. 1, the later No. 2. Bailey\r\nand Kerr, however, in 1894, published Hattonkin No. 1 as a synonym of\r\nGeorgeson and Hattonkin No. 2, the later, as a synonym of the Kerr. The\r\nGeorgia Horticultural Society accepted this latter nomenclature in their\r\nreport published in 1895. The Mikado, White Kelsey and Yeddo as tested by\r\nthis Station have proved to be identical with Georgeson, but as tested\r\nby Kerr,[212] the Mikado alone is the same. Normand, which is said to\r\nhave been imported and introduced in 1891 by J. L. Normand, is also\r\nindistinguishable from this variety. In 1897, Georgeson was placed on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading or\r\n    broad-vasiform, not always hardy, productive; branches\r\n    roughish, slightly thorny, often with bark cracked\r\n    longitudinally, zigzag, dark ash-gray; branchlets glabrous,\r\n    with characteristic raised lenticels; leaf-scars enlarged;\r\n    leaves folded upward, broadly oblanceolate or obovate, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches wide, three and three-quarters inches\r\n    long, thin; margin crenate or serrate, with small, amber\r\n    glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, reddish, with from\r\n    one to ten brownish-red glands usually on the stalk; blooming\r\n    season early to medium, of average length; flowers appearing\r\n    before the leaves; borne in clusters on lateral spurs, in pairs\r\n    or in threes; petals pinkish at the base; anthers reddish;\r\n    pistil longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, ripening period short; one and five-eighths inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish-cordate; cavity deep, wide, usually\r\n    with concentric, russet lines; color greenish-yellow changing\r\n    to deep yellow as the fruit reaches full maturity, with thin\r\n    bloom; flesh golden-yellow, fibrous, firm, sweetish except near\r\n    the center; fair to good; stone clinging, five-eighths inch\r\n    by one-half inch in size, oval, turgid, with pitted surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture broad, slightly ribbed; dorsal suture acute.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN PRUNE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN PRUNE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Knoop _Fructologie_ =2=:53, 61. 1771. 2.

It is a little difficult, in America at least, to see why this\r\nfruit holds its popularity so long, for it is surpassed by other plums\r\nin many horticultural characters, and when all of its characters, most\r\nof which are very good, are combined there are still plums which it does\r\nnot excel. In most of the attributes which gratify the senses, color,\r\nsize, shape, taste and smell, it falls below expectations for a plum so\r\nuniversally planted. Undoubtedly the wide distribution of this plum is\r\ndue somewhat to its many variations. The fruit comes almost true to seed\r\nand is often propagated by planting pits, a practice which has given many\r\nslightly different strains of this variety, each with somewhat different\r\nadaptations.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World the number of strains of this plum, especially in\r\nGermany, is legion, so many that it is probably impossible to segregate\r\nthem at this late date. In America, while there are a number of these\r\nmore or less distinct strains it is yet possible to distinguish the chief\r\nones. In New York, the most commonly grown German Prune is the Rochester\r\nstrain and since it agrees most closely with the fruit described in\r\nthe best works on pomology, it is the strain described and illustrated\r\nin this work. The trees from which this description was made came from\r\nEllwanger and Barry, Rochester, New York, who have long maintained a\r\nstock tree of this strain. Another German Prune, fruit of which we have\r\nnot been able to obtain, is the Dansville strain grown in the nurseries\r\nof Dansville, New York. Still another of these plums is the Weedsport\r\nGerman Prune[213] so like the Rochester type as to be hardly worth\r\ndistinguishing. The Latz German Prune is a very distinct strain; it is\r\nlarger, thicker and broader than the type here described and is more of a\r\nclingstone. In some respects this is the best of the German Prunes. All\r\naccounts agree that this plum was introduced into America from Prussia\r\nby a Mr. Latz about 1850.\r\n\r\nAll of these German Prunes are characterized by large, hardy, vigorous,\r\nhealthy, productive trees, characters so marked that one can say at once\r\nthat it is the tree that gives the German Prune its great value. The\r\nfruit is excellent for all culinary purposes, especially for canning, and\r\ncures into a small but very good, tart, meaty, freestone, elastic prune.\r\nThe chief objection to the plum for these purposes is that the fruits run\r\nsmall. The plums are too tart to have much value as dessert fruits. This\r\nvariety is likely to remain a standard for some time in New York but will\r\neventually be superseded by a larger fruit.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this plum is uncertain. German writers very generally\r\nhold that it came from Asia whence it was carried during the Crusades\r\nto Europe. Lauche, a German authority, says, “In the Sixteenth Century,\r\nthe first dried prunes were introduced into Italy, Switzerland and\r\nGermany from Hungary. The tree on the contrary is said not to have been\r\nintroduced by us until the end of the Seventeenth Century.” A Prune Plum\r\nwas noted in America by Coxe in 1817, but it is impossible to say whether\r\nhe meant the German Prune. Prince, however, in 1832, described the\r\nvariety under its present name. In 1856, the American Pomological Society\r\nplaced the German Prune on the list of the varieties promising well and\r\nsix years later added it to its fruit catalog. The German Prune is used\r\nonly in the fresh state in New York, but on the Pacific Coast, in some\r\none of its several types, it is one of the half-dozen leading sorts for\r\ncuring.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, round and dense-topped,\r\n    hardy, usually very productive; branches ash-gray, somewhat\r\n    rough, with lenticels variable in size; branchlets slender,\r\n    short, with internodes of medium length, green changing to\r\n    brownish-red, dull, glabrous, with numerous, small, obscure\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds intermediate in size and length, conical,\r\n    free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, oval or obovate, one and one-half inches\r\n    wide, three inches long, thinnish, velvety; upper surface\r\n    pubescent, slightly rugose, with a shallow groove on the\r\n    midrib; lower surface yellowish-green, heavily pubescent; apex\r\n    abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin finely serrate,\r\n    with small glands; petiole one-half inch long, pubescent,\r\n    tinged with red, glandless or with one or two small, globose\r\n    glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, nearly one inch across,\r\n    inconspicuous on account of their greenish-yellow color, which\r\n    characterizes the variety; borne on lateral spurs, singly or\r\n    in pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch long; below medium in\r\n    thickness, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    lightly pubescent at the base; calyx-lobes long, narrow,\r\n    acute, thinly pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate,\r\n    erect; petals narrow, long-oval or obovate, erose, tapering\r\n    to broad claws of medium length; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil very pubescent at the base,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripening period very long; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one inch in size, oval, slightly swollen on\r\n    the ventral side, halves unequal; cavity very shallow,\r\n    narrow, flaring; suture a faint line; apex pointed; color\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    small, brown, inconspicuous, clustered about the base; stem\r\n    below medium in thickness, five-eighths inch long, adhering\r\n    well to the fruit; skin tough, separating readily; flesh\r\n    yellowish-green, medium juicy, firm, sweetish, mild, pleasant\r\n    flavor; good to very good; stone free, seven-eighths inch\r\n    by one-half inch in size, the cavity larger than the pit,\r\n    flattened, obliquely long-oval, pointed at the apex and\r\n    base, with rough and pitted surfaces; ventral suture narrow,\r\n    conspicuously winged; dorsal suture narrowly and shallowly\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIANT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIANT]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard. & For._ =7=:420. 1894. =2.= Burbank _Cat._ 5, fig.\r\n    1895. =3.= _Cal.

The\r\naccompanying color-plate shows the color and shape very well, but the\r\nfruit is a little too small. Unfortunately Giant is somewhat inferior\r\nin quality, a disappointment to all, as with Agen for a parent high\r\nquality was to be expected. In quality, as in all fruit-characters, the\r\nvariety resembles the male parent, Pond. The flesh is coarse, fibrous,\r\nlacking in juice, clings more or less to the stone and rots quickly under\r\nunfavorable conditions. The trees, too, lack somewhat in both vigor and\r\nproductiveness. Introduced as a prune, it was supposed that this variety\r\nwould prove a great boon to prune-makers, but it does not cure well and\r\nis now hardly used for drying. Giant is proving to be one of the very\r\nbest shipping plums, as would be expected because of its firm, dry flesh.\r\nIt is unfortunate that so attractive a plum cannot be unqualifiedly\r\nrecommended, but it is doubtful if it is worth planting on a commercial\r\nscale in New York.\r\n\r\nGiant was grown by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, from a seed of\r\nAgen fertilized by Pond, the Hungarian Prune of the Pacific Coast. The\r\nstock of this variety was offered for sale to nurserymen in 1893 and\r\n1894, but not to fruit-growers until 1895, and then by the originator.\r\nThe American Pomological Society placed it on their fruit catalog list in\r\n1899 as a promising variety for this region and southern California.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, round and dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    usually productive; branches short, stocky, dark ash-gray, with\r\n    large lenticels; branchlets short, with internodes of medium\r\n    length, greenish-red changing to dark brownish-red, dull,\r\n    thinly pubescent, heavily marked with scarf-skin and with few,\r\n    small, inconspicuous lenticels; leaf-buds small to medium,\r\n    short, conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate or oval, two and one-quarter\r\n    inches wide, three and three-quarters inches long; upper\r\n    surface pubescent only along the midrib; lower surface pale\r\n    green, lightly pubescent on the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    abruptly pointed or acute, margin serrate or crenate, usually\r\n    with small, dark glands; petiole three-quarters inch long,\r\n    tinged red along one side, sparingly pubescent, glandless or\r\n    with from one to four greenish-brown glands usually on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and three-sixteenths inches\r\n    across, creamy in the buds, changing to white on opening,\r\n    borne in scattering clusters on short, lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    singly or in pairs; pedicels three-eighths inch long, thick,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous or\r\n    lightly pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals oval, somewhat\r\n    erose, with short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, period of ripening short; two inches by\r\n    one and one-half inches in size, obovate, slightly necked,\r\n    compressed, halves unequal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt;\r\n    suture shallow; apex roundish or depressed; color light to dark\r\n    purplish-red, overspread with bloom of medium thickness; dots\r\n    numerous, smallish, russet, inconspicuous; stem seven-eighths\r\n    inch long, thinly pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    of medium thickness and toughness, adhering but slightly to the\r\n    pulp; flesh light golden-yellow, variable in juiciness, coarse,\r\n    somewhat fibrous, firm, rather sweet, mild fair in quality;\r\n    stone semi-clinging or clinging, one and one-eighth inches by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, long-oval, flattened, with rough\r\n    and pitted surfaces; ventral suture strongly furrowed; dorsal\r\n    suture with a shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

The\r\nfruit is large and attractive in color and shape, but it is not high in\r\nquality and it must be rated among Domestica plums as only a mediocre\r\nfruit. The tree is said generally to give better satisfaction than the\r\nfruit. This variety originated with Alexander Glass, Guelph, Ontario,\r\nand has been cultivated extensively by Canadian growers to whom its\r\nproductivity and hardiness recommend it.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open, productive,\r\n    hardy; branches rough, stocky; branchlets rather slender,\r\n    pubescent; leaves folded backward, obovate or oval, one and\r\n    three-quarters inches wide, three and one-half inches long;\r\n    margin finely serrate; petiole reddish, pubescent, with from\r\n    one to three smallish, globose glands usually at the base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-half inches by one and\r\n    three-eighths inches in size, oblong-oval, purplish-black,\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; stem adhering firmly to the fruit;\r\n    skin thin, tender, rather sour; flesh light yellow, juicy,\r\n    firm, sweet, mild; of fair quality; stone clinging, one inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, irregular-oval, with oblique apex,\r\n    the surfaces rough and pitted; ventral suture prominent, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDEN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana × Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

Large for its\r\ngroup, beautifully turned, it presents a most striking appearance long\r\nbefore it is ripe, with its bright yellow skin and crimson cheek, the\r\nwhole plum turning to a brilliant currant-red with a delicate bloom at\r\nmaturity. But the plum is little more than showy. The flavor is not\r\ngood, the flesh is fibrous, excessively juicy and adheres to the stone,\r\nthe skin is tough and astringent. In spite of the juiciness the plum\r\nships well, owing to the tough skin, but the fruits are much attacked by\r\nbrown-rot and the skin cracks badly under unfavorable conditions. The\r\ntrees are rather small, uncertain in bearing, often enormously productive\r\nbut do not hold the crop well, and the plums ripen unevenly. Strange to\r\nsay, considering the parentage, the variety is hardy, according to Waugh\r\nstanding the winters at Burlington, Vermont, almost perfectly. In tree\r\nand fruit the variety is more like its American parent than the Asiatic\r\none. Golden can never be a money-maker in New York, but it is worth\r\nhaving in a home orchard for its handsome appearance.\r\n\r\nThe original tree of this variety was grown in 1887 or 1888 by Luther\r\nBurbank, Santa Rosa, California, from a seed of Robinson fertilized by\r\npollen of Abundance. In 1892, the variety was erroneously described\r\nin the United States Department of Agriculture Report as a seedling\r\nof Kelsey fertilized by Burbank. The same year it was named Golden\r\nby Burbank and in 1893 it was offered for sale in his catalog, _New\r\nCreations in Fruits and Flowers_. Soon after, the original tree and\r\nthe right of introduction were purchased by Stark Brothers Nurseries\r\nand Orchards Company, Louisiana, Missouri, and in 1894 the variety was\r\ncatalogued and disseminated under the name Gold. This name was registered\r\nas a trade-mark in the United States Patent Office in 1905, but as the\r\nprior application and publication of Golden entitles it to precedence\r\naccording to the nomenclature of the American Pomological Society, the\r\nname Gold has generally been dropped by pomologists. The confusion as to\r\nthe origin and nomenclature of this variety has been increased by its\r\nparentage being published[214] as a cross of Robinson and Kelsey and by\r\nthe California shippers labeling it Late Klondike.\r\n\r\n    Tree variable in size and vigor, usually small, somewhat\r\n    vasiform, medium dense, hardy in all but the coldest\r\n    localities, an uncertain bearer unless grown under favorable\r\n    conditions, when it becomes very productive, susceptible\r\n    to attacks of shot-hole fungus; trunk shaggy, sometimes\r\n    gnarly; branches strong, unusually rough, grayish-brown,\r\n    with longitudinal cracks in the bark, with very numerous,\r\n    small, raised lenticels; branchlets willowy, numerous, long,\r\n    with short internodes, green changing to dull reddish-brown,\r\n    marked with gray scarf-skin, glossy, glabrous, with numerous,\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves usually flattened, broadly lanceolate, peach-like, one\r\n    inch wide by three and one-half inches long, thin, somewhat\r\n    rigid; upper surface light green, smooth, glabrous, with deeply\r\n    grooved midrib; lower surface pale green, thinly pubescent;\r\n    apex taper-pointed, base acute, margin serrate or crenate,\r\n    with numerous, small, dark red glands; petiole slender,\r\n    three-eighths inch in length, tinged red, sparingly pubescent\r\n    along one side, glandless or with from one to seven small,\r\n    globose, yellowish-green glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season long; flowers appearing after the leaves,\r\n    three-quarters inch across, white; borne in clusters on short\r\n    lateral spurs and buds, in pairs or in threes; pedicels\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, slender, glabrous, green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, acute, sparingly glandular-serrate and pubescent, with\r\n    scattering marginal hairs, erect; petals oval, entire, clawed;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period very long; medium to\r\n    sometimes large, roundish-oblate, halves equal; cavity deep,\r\n    flaring, regular; suture a line; apex roundish or pointed;\r\n    color golden-yellow blushed or overspread with bright red, with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, very small, whitish, inconspicuous,\r\n    thickly sprinkled around the apex; stem five-eighths inch long,\r\n    glabrous, adhering fairly well to the fruit; skin rather tough,\r\n    astringent, inclined to crack under unfavorable conditions,\r\n    separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, unusually juicy and\r\n    fibrous, tender and melting, sprightly, sweet next the skin\r\n    but tart near the center; fair in quality; stone adhering,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, oval, turgid,\r\n    flattened at the base, abruptly sharp-pointed at the apex, with\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture slightly winged; dorsal suture\r\n    broadly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN BEAUTY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDEN BEAUTY]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Missouri Apricot 5,\r\n    6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13.\r\n\r\nFrom the fruit-grower’s standpoint, Golden Beauty is of little interest.\r\nThe plums are so small and the quality so poor that the variety is not\r\nworth planting either for the home or for money-making. It is true\r\nthat the firm, juicy fruits are very good for table use, in jellies\r\nin particular, and that they may be shipped long distances, but these\r\ncharacters cannot offset the handicap of small size and poor quality. The\r\nvariety is of interest to botanists because it seems to be a wanderer out\r\nof the range of the species to which it belongs. As the history which\r\nfollows seems to show, Golden Beauty was found in a part of Texas where\r\n_Prunus hortulana_ does not grow (see the discussion of this species) and\r\nquite as remarkable if it really comes from so warm a part of Texas is\r\nthe fact that it should be perfectly hardy here and even farther north.\r\nThere is a mystery yet to be cleared up about this plum. The variety is\r\nvery ornamental in flower, foliage and fruit.\r\n\r\nAccording to current account, Golden Beauty was found wild by a German\r\non the Colorado River in western Texas during the Civil War. After the\r\nwar, the German planted his new plum in a yard in Victoria County, Texas,\r\nwhere it attracted the attention of Gilbert Onderdonk, Mission Valley,\r\nsouthern Texas. Onderdonk, noting its merits, propagated and introduced\r\nit in 1874. In 1886, Stark Brothers, of Missouri, introduced the Missouri\r\nApricot, the Honey Drop of some, which they claimed was found wild in\r\nMissouri. Several pomologists have noted the close similarity of this\r\nvariety to Golden Beauty and as tested at this Station they are identical\r\nin all respects and are therefore placed under the older name. In 1897\r\nthe American Pomological Society placed this plum on its fruit catalog\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, somewhat irregular in\r\n    habit, usually spreading, low, dense and flat-topped, hardy,\r\n    variable in productiveness, somewhat subject to attacks of\r\n    shot-hole fungus; trunk rough, shaggy; branches roughish,\r\n    thorny, zigzag, dark ash-gray, with numerous lenticels of\r\n    medium size; branchlets long, slender, twiggy, with short\r\n    internodes, green changing to greenish-brown, shining,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous, conspicuous, large, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds small, very short, obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, narrowly oval, one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches wide, four inches long, thin; upper surface smooth,\r\n    glabrous, with a grooved midrib; lower surface light green,\r\n    sparingly pubescent along the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    acuminate, base abrupt, margin irregularly and doubly crenate,\r\n    with small, dark brown glands; petiole seven-eighths inch long,\r\n    slender, green, thinly pubescent along one side, glandless or\r\n    with from one to eight very small, globose, blackish glands\r\n    scattered mostly below the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, white; borne\r\n    in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, with from four to\r\n    six flowers in each umbel; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch\r\n    in length, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, erect, thinly pubescent\r\n    within, glandular-serrate, the glands reddish; petals\r\n    ovate or roundish-oval, erose, tapering below into long,\r\n    narrow, pubescent claws; anthers light yellow; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch in length; pistil glabrous, shorter than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season of medium length; one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish to roundish-oval, somewhat compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity shallow, narrow, slightly flaring; suture very shallow\r\n    or a line; apex roundish or pointed; color orange-yellow,\r\n    mottled, overspread with thin bloom; dots characteristic,\r\n    numerous, large and small, yellowish, decidedly conspicuous\r\n    producing a somewhat mottled appearance, clustered about the\r\n    apex; stem very slender, five-eighths inch in length, glabrous,\r\n    adhering poorly to the fruit; skin thick, tough, adhering to\r\n    the pulp; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, coarse, fibrous, tender,\r\n    mildly sweet, with a faint apricot flavor, somewhat acid when\r\n    cooked; fair in quality; stone adhering, five-eighths inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, turgid, oval, abruptly pointed at the\r\n    base and apex, smooth and with a coating of yellowish-brown,\r\n    cottony substance; ventral suture broad, lightly furrowed;\r\n    dorsal suture acute or with a shallow furrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN CHERRY\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hoffy _Orch.

Waterloo of some\r\n    7, 8,? 14, 15.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this fine old plum, the largest, handsomest and best of the\r\nyellow plums, is fit only for the amateur in New York and in the hands\r\neven of the most careful of amateurs it does not reach the perfection\r\nin either appearance or quality that is expected of it in Europe or on\r\nthe Pacific Coast of America. In spite of special efforts to obtain\r\nspecimens for illustration which would do this variety justice, the\r\ncolor-plate of Golden Drop is far from satisfactory as regards either\r\nsize or color of the fruit. In this region trees of Golden Drop lack\r\nconstitution and while hardy in tree, the fruit-buds are often caught by\r\nthe cold. From lack of vigor and from injury by freezing, the variety is\r\nnot productive. The trees, too, are slow in growth and the fruit needs a\r\nlong season to reach perfect maturity, often failing to ripen in parts\r\nof New York where other plums mature well. Again, the trees are subject\r\nto nearly all the ills to which plums are heir and have a somewhat\r\nprecarious existence because of insects and diseases though the fruit\r\nis not as subject to brown-rot as is that of the Yellow Egg with which\r\nthis variety is usually compared. Golden Drop is seemingly fit for all\r\npurposes to which plums are put—for dessert, cooking, canning, preserving\r\nand prune-making. For the last named purpose it is unsurpassed for a\r\nlight colored prune of large size, readily selling at a fancy price in\r\ndelicatessen stores. The fruit when carefully picked and handled keeps\r\nfor a month or more, shrivelling somewhat but retaining its flavor and\r\npleasing flesh-characters. A task for the plant-breeder is to breed a\r\nplum, of which one of the parents should be Golden Drop, which will give\r\nto this region a plum as good as the Golden Drop in regions where it is\r\nat its best. With all of its defects in the North and East, it is yet\r\nworth growing for the home and often for the late market.\r\n\r\nJervaise Coe, a market gardener, at Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England,\r\nraised Golden Drop from a seed about 1809. Lindley (References, 5) says,\r\n“He [the originator] informed me it was from the stone of Green Gage, the\r\nblossom of which, he supposed, had been fertilized by the White Magnum\r\nBonum, the two trees of which grew nearly in contact with each other in\r\nhis garden.” From a study of the fruit-characters this supposition is\r\nvery probable. C. M. Hovey in discussing the synonyms of this variety\r\nwrites, “The French have disseminated it considerably under the name of\r\nWaterloo; trees received under that name have fruited in our collection\r\nthis year, and proved to be the Golden Drop.” Robert Hogg, in his\r\n_Fruit Manual_, published in 1884, described Waterloo as a separate\r\nvariety, found at Waterloo, Belgium, and introduced by Dr. Van Mons; the\r\ndescriptions of the two are practically identical. The Silver Prune, well\r\nknown on the Pacific Coast, at one time supposed to be a new variety,\r\nturned out upon investigation to be Golden Drop, though the growers there\r\ncontinue to call it by the new name they have given it. The variety under\r\ndiscussion came to America in 1823, when Knight, of England, sent a tree\r\nof it to John Lowell of Massachusetts. In 1852, the American Pomological\r\nSociety valued it sufficiently to place it on the list of the fruits\r\nworthy of general cultivation.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, spreading or roundish,\r\n    open-topped, hardy, productive; branches ash-gray, roughish,\r\n    with few, large lenticels; branchlets short, stout, with\r\n    internodes variable in length, greenish-red changing to dull\r\n    brownish-red becoming drab on the older wood, glabrous early in\r\n    the season but becoming pubescent at maturity, with numerous,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval or obovate, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, two and three-quarters inches long, thickish;\r\n    upper surface dark green, slightly rugose, pubescent, with\r\n    the midrib but faintly grooved; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin\r\n    serrate, eglandular or with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    one-half inch long, pubescent, tinged red, with from two to\r\n    three globose, greenish-yellow glands usually at the base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, white, borne in clusters on lateral\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch long,\r\n    lightly pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, narrowly\r\n    campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes obtuse, sparingly pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals oval,\r\n    dentate, tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season of average length; two inches by one\r\n    and one-half inches in size, oval, tapering at the base to a\r\n    short neck, slightly compressed, halves equal; cavity very\r\n    shallow and narrow, abrupt; suture shallow and wide; apex\r\n    depressed; color golden-yellow, occasionally with a faint\r\n    bronze blush, showing greenish streaks and splashes before full\r\n    maturity, overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    russet, conspicuous; stem three-quarters inch long, thinly\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin tough, rather\r\n    adherent; flesh light golden-yellow, juicy, intermediate in\r\n    firmness and tenderness, rather sweet, mild, pleasant flavor;\r\n    good to very good; stone free, one and three-eighths inches by\r\n    three-quarters inch in size, oval or ovate, slightly flattened,\r\n    irregularly ridged and roughened, acute at the base and apex;\r\n    ventral suture wide, often conspicuously winged; dorsal suture\r\n    widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLIATH\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

It is a large, handsome, purple plum,\r\nas the illustration well shows, but seldom fit for dessert. “Seldom fit”\r\nbecause it is quite variable in quality in some seasons and under some\r\nconditions. It is an excellent culinary plum and its firm, thick, meaty\r\nflesh fits it well for shipping. On the grounds of this Station the\r\ntrees behave very well in all respects and usually bear very full crops\r\nof plums that would tempt purchasers in any market. It has all of the\r\ncharacters usually ascribed to a money-maker variety of any fruit and why\r\nnot more grown in commercial orchards cannot be said.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the origin of this plum except that it is English.\r\nWilliam Prince, in 1828, wrote: “This plum is of very large size, and has\r\nattracted much notice in England; but it is only recently introduced to\r\nthis country, where it has not yet produced fruit that I am aware of.”\r\nThe Nectarine plum was confused with the Goliath in the early part of the\r\nNineteenth Century, but Robert Thompson,[215] the English horticulturist,\r\nseparated them so satisfactorily that they have ever since remained\r\ndistinct in plum literature. He found that this variety had pubescent\r\nshoots and fruit-stalks, while the same parts of the Nectarine were\r\nglabrous, and that the season of Goliath is considerably later. The\r\nAmerican Pomological Society placed Goliath on its fruit list in 1862,\r\nbut dropped it in 1871.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, dense, hardy, very\r\n    productive; branches stocky, with fruit-spurs numerous,\r\n    ash-gray, smooth except for the large, raised lenticels;\r\n    branchlets somewhat thick, short, with internodes of medium\r\n    length, green changing to dull brownish-drab, heavily pubescent\r\n    throughout the season, with few, inconspicuous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds of average size and length, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves somewhat flattened, obovate, two inches wide, three and\r\n    five-eighths inches long; upper surface dark green, nearly\r\n    glabrous, with a grooved midrib; lower surface heavily\r\n    pubescent; apex obtuse or acute, base acute, margin finely\r\n    serrate, eglandular or with few, small dark glands; petiole\r\n    one-half inch long, thick, heavily pubescent, with a faint red\r\n    tinge, glandless or with from one to three large, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early to medium, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one inch across, white; borne on lateral\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, lightly\r\n    pubescent; calyx-lobes, broad, obtuse, somewhat pubescent,\r\n    glandular-serrate, erect; petals unusually large, roundish,\r\n    finely crenate, not clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens, with a large style and stigma.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-half inches in size, roundish-oblong,\r\n    somewhat oblique, truncate, compressed, halves unequal; cavity\r\n    narrow, abrupt, usually russeted; suture a line; apex flattened\r\n    or depressed; color dark purplish-red, lighter colored on the\r\n    shaded side, overspread with thick bloom; dots characteristic,\r\n    numerous, large, russet, conspicuous, clustered about the\r\n    apex; stem thick, three-quarters inch long, thickly pubescent,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh golden-yellow, rather dry, firm, sweet, of\r\n    mild, pleasant flavor; fair to good; stone free, seven-eighths\r\n    inch by three-quarters inch in size, roundish-oval, somewhat\r\n    flattened, blunt at the base and apex, roughened and\r\n    irregularly furrowed; ventral suture wide, winged, heavily\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture with a wide groove variable in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGONZALES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLIATH]\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ ×\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kerr _Cat._ 1899-1900. =2.= _Vt.

Red Gold 5.\r\n\r\nJudging from the several published descriptions, Gonzales is a very\r\npromising plum, for the South at least. The writers have not seen the\r\nvariety in the North, but there appear to be no reasons why it should\r\nnot succeed in some northern soils and climates. It is a chance seedling\r\nfound in Gonzales, Texas, about 1894, and was introduced by F. T. Ramsey,\r\nAustin, Texas, in 1897. About all that can be determined regarding its\r\nparentage is that it is the product of some Japanese variety pollinated\r\nby a native. In 1901, Waugh used this variety to typify a new species,\r\n_Prunus hortulana robusta_, composed of a number of hybrids between\r\n_Prunus triflora_ and native species. The following description is\r\ncompiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, open; leaves narrow, oval,\r\n    tapering at both ends; upper surface glabrous; margin minutely\r\n    glandular, finely crenulate; petiole short and slender, with\r\n    two glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; resembles Burbank in size and shape; skin\r\n    toughish; color bright red, sometimes striped and splashed with\r\n    dark red; flesh yellow, tinged red, firm, sweet; good; stone of\r\n    medium size, oval, clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND DUKE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND DUKE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 703. 1884. =2.= Mathieu _Nom.

Its great popularity, gained in less than a quarter of a\r\ncentury, is due to much advertising by nurserymen coupled with such\r\nintrinsic qualities as large size, the true prune shape which seems most\r\npleasing in some markets, handsome plum-purple and more than all else a\r\nfirm, meaty flesh which fits the variety excellently for shipping. The\r\nflavor, as seems most often to be the case with these large blue plums,\r\nis not pleasant and the plum is not more than a second rate dessert fruit\r\nthough it is very good in whatever way cooked for the table. The trees\r\ngrow poorly in the nursery and even in the orchard are seldom large\r\nand vigorous enough to be called first class, though usually hardy.\r\nSome years ago plum-growers were advised to top-work this and other\r\nweak-growing plums on stronger stocks, but those who have tried such\r\ntop-working usually condemn it because it is expensive and ineffective\r\nand because it so often gives a malformed tree. The trees come in bearing\r\nslowly but bear regularly and abundantly and hold the crop well, the\r\nplums being unusually free from rot and hanging in good condition a long\r\ntime. Grand Duke deserves its popularity as a market plum and probably no\r\nbetter variety can be selected in New York for the last of the season.\r\n\r\nGrand Duke is another of the many valuable plums produced by Thomas\r\nRivers, of Sawbridgeworth, England. It was grown from an Autumn Compote\r\nstone and was sent out in 1876. When it was first introduced into America\r\nis not known, but in 1888 cions of it were distributed by Ellwanger and\r\nBarry[216] of Rochester, New York. In 1897, the American Pomological\r\nSociety added this variety to its fruit catalog list and recommended it\r\nfor this State and neighboring regions with similar climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, moderately vigorous, upright to\r\n    slightly spreading, usually hardy, productive; branches\r\n    ash-gray, with small, numerous lenticels; branchlets slender,\r\n    short, with internodes of medium length, greenish-red changing\r\n    to brownish-red, many twigs retaining a tinge of green,\r\n    shining, glabrous, with numerous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    large, long, pointed, strongly appressed; leaf-scars large.\r\n\r\n    Leaves nearly flat, obovate, one and one-half inches wide,\r\n    three inches long, thick; upper surface shining, slightly\r\n    rugose, pubescent only along the grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    yellowish-green, lightly pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base\r\n    acute, margin serrate, eglandular or with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole three-quarters inch long, nearly glabrous, slightly\r\n    tinged red along one side, glandless or with from one to three\r\n    globose yellowish glands on the stalk and base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one inch across, white; borne in clusters on\r\n    short lateral spurs and buds, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    one-half inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes lightly pubescent,\r\n    glandular-ciliate, slightly reflexed; petals obovate, entire,\r\n    short-clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch\r\n    long; pistil pubescent at the base, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season medium; unusually large when well grown, two\r\n    and one-eighth inches by two inches in size, elongated-oval\r\n    or slightly obovate, halves unequal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    abrupt; suture wide, variable in depth; apex flattened,\r\n    somewhat depressed or occasionally with a short, blunt tip;\r\n    color dark reddish-purple or purplish-black, overspread with\r\n    thick bloom; dots numerous, small, brownish, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem three-quarters inch long, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    variable in toughness, somewhat astringent, separating readily;\r\n    flesh golden-yellow, juicy, firm, sweet, mild, not high in\r\n    flavor; good; stone clinging, sometimes tinged red, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches by seven-eighths inch in size, irregularly\r\n    oval, slightly flattened, roughish, acute at the base and apex;\r\n    ventral suture broad, slightly winged; dorsal suture with a\r\n    broad, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUEII\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUEII]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Guii 1, 6. _Gweii_ 1.\r\n\r\nGueii is one of the standard plums of its season in New York, ranking\r\namong the first half-dozen in number of trees growing in the State, with\r\nmany growers holding that it is the best general purpose plum of all\r\nDomesticas. The popularity of Gueii is due to its being a money-maker, as\r\nfew would care to grow it for home consumption. The quality of Gueii is\r\npoor, especially for dessert, and it cannot even be called a particularly\r\ngood-looking plum, though the illustration scarcely does the plum\r\njustice, especially in size. But the variety bears early and abundantly;\r\nthe trees are large, vigorous, healthy and hardy and the plums are hardly\r\nsurpassed for shipping, especially at the time at which the crop comes\r\nupon the market, about mid-season, the best shipping plums maturing a\r\nlittle later. The fruit is quite subject to brown-rot, a matter of more\r\nmoment in other regions than in New York, and yet in some seasons very\r\nimportant in this State. The stone, curiously enough, sometimes clings\r\nrather tightly and under other conditions is wholly free. It could be\r\nwished that so popular a market plum were better in quality, but since\r\nhigh quality is seldom correlated in plums with fitness to ship well, it\r\nwould be unfair to condemn Gueii for a market fruit because it cannot be\r\neaten with relish out of hand.\r\n\r\nThis plum, according to all accounts, originated with a Mr. Hagaman,\r\nLansingburgh, New York, about 1830. It was brought to notice by John\r\nGoeway (Gueii) and was soon called by his name. For years it was not much\r\ngrown and it was not until 1899 that it was placed on the fruit catalog\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy, very\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, roughened by longitudinal\r\n    cracks and by numerous, conspicuous, raised lenticels of\r\n    various sizes; branchlets thick, of medium length, with short\r\n    internodes, green changing to dark brownish-drab, dull, thickly\r\n    pubescent throughout the season, with numerous, inconspicuous,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds short, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves obovate or oval, one and seven-eighths inches wide,\r\n    four inches long, thick; upper surface dark green, with\r\n    scattering fine hairs and with a grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, thickly pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or\r\n    acute, base variable but usually acute, margin doubly crenate,\r\n    with small black glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, thick,\r\n    pubescent, tinged red.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    and one-eighth inches across, whitish; borne in clusters at the\r\n    ends of spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels thirteen-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    pubescent towards the base; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, entire, with very short, blunt claws; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    medium to above in size, somewhat ovate, halves equal; cavity\r\n    below medium in depth and width, abrupt, rarely sutured; apex\r\n    bluntly pointed; color dark purplish-black, overspread with\r\n    thick bloom; dots numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the apex; stem medium in thickness and length,\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tender,\r\n    slightly astringent, separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow\r\n    changing to light golden-yellow, dry, firm but tender, sweet,\r\n    mild, somewhat astringent towards the center; fair in quality;\r\n    stone variable in adhesion but usually clinging, large, ovate\r\n    or oval, blunt at the base and apex, strongly roughened and\r\n    pitted; ventral suture faintly winged; dorsal suture acute or\r\n    lightly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTHRIE LATE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= McIntosh _Bk.

When mature on the trees the fruits are yellow with a\r\nfaint blush, but in storage the color quickly changes into a pale red,\r\nbecoming, when the plum is at its best in appearance and quality, a light\r\ncurrant-red. Hale, though large and handsome of fruit, is of questionable\r\nvalue, failing both in fruit and tree. The flavor of this plum is good\r\nin the judgment of most fruit connoisseurs, but others find it a little\r\ntoo sweet and somewhat mawkish near the skin and close about the pit.\r\nAll agree, however, that the flesh clings too tightly to the stone for\r\npleasant eating and that the texture is too tender for good shipping.\r\nBut it is the tree that fails most markedly. Even on the grounds of this\r\nStation, where the peach is practically hardy, Hale is but semi-hardy,\r\nfailing most often because with the best of care the wood does not ripen\r\nproperly. The habit of growth is not particularly good, the trees are\r\nslow in coming in bearing, are not regularly productive and are readily\r\ninfected by brown-rot and the fruits much infested by curculio. On the\r\nwhole, it is to be regretted that Mr. Hale did not choose a better plum\r\nto bear a name so distinguished in horticulture.\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank offered this plum, a cross between Kelsey and Satsuma, for\r\nsale under the name J, in 1893, and the following year as Prolific. J.\r\nH. Hale, South Glastonbury, Connecticut, purchased the variety in 1894,\r\nand introduced it as the Hale in 1896. In 1899, the American Pomological\r\nSociety considered it worthy a place on its fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, vasiform, open-topped,\r\n    semi-hardy, variable in productiveness; branches smooth\r\n    except for the numerous, small, raised lenticels, somewhat\r\n    thorny, dark ash-gray, the fruit spurs numerous; branchlets\r\n    willowy, of medium thickness and length, with short internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to light brown, shining, glabrous;\r\n    lenticels numerous, small; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse,\r\n    plump, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves sparse, folded upward, oblanceolate or narrowly obovate,\r\n    one and three-quarters inches wide, three and one-half inches\r\n    long, thin; upper surface glabrous except for scattering\r\n    hairs, with a grooved midrib; lower surface light green,\r\n    glabrous except along the midrib and larger veins; apex acute\r\n    or abruptly pointed, base acute, margin finely serrate or\r\n    crenate, eglandular; petiole nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    slender, tinged red, glandless or with from one to four globose\r\n    or reniform, greenish-yellow glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    before the leaves, white; borne in thin clusters on lateral\r\n    buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels long, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    obtuse, with numerous hair-like glands, nearly glabrous, erect;\r\n    petals roundish-ovate, entire, not clawed; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments short; pistil glabrous except at the base, much\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and three-quarters inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish, halves equal; cavity of medium depth and\r\n    width, abrupt, regular; suture a line; apex roundish; color\r\n    light or greenish-yellow, more or less blushed with red on\r\n    one side, becoming red at maturity, mottled, with thin bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, small, whitish, conspicuous only where the skin\r\n    is blushed; stem slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous,\r\n    detaching easily from the fruit; skin thin, tough, adhering;\r\n    flesh yellowish, very juicy, fibrous, tender, melting next the\r\n    skin but firmer at the center, sweet except near the pit; good\r\n    in quality; stone adhering, three-quarters inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, roundish-oval, flattened, blunt but with a\r\n    small, sharp tip, rough; ventral suture narrow and rather\r\n    conspicuously winged; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMMER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMMER]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri_ × _Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cornell Sta.

On the Station grounds the\r\ntrees of this variety make the best orchard plants of any of the native\r\nvarieties, being large, vigorous, shapely and hardy, falling short only\r\nin being a little uncertain in bearing. The fruits are good in quality,\r\nhandsome in appearance and keep and ship well, but crack badly in\r\nunfavorable weather and, according to some writers, are quite subject to\r\nbrown-rot. Hammer extends the season of the Americana plums considerably,\r\nfor though a hybrid, it may best be ranked with the Americanas, and is\r\nwell worth planting in home orchards in New York, where the native plums\r\nare too seldom found; in particular, this variety can be recommended for\r\nthe colder parts of this State where Domestica and Insititia plums are\r\nnot hardy.\r\n\r\nHammer is one of H. A. Terry’s numerous productions and was grown from a\r\nseed of the Miner evidently fertilized by an Americana. The blood of the\r\nlatter is shown by its hardiness and its broad, Americana-like foliage.\r\nThe variety first fruited in 1888 and was sent out in 1892.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, round-topped, widely spreading,\r\n    hardy at Geneva, an uncertain bearer; trunk and larger limbs\r\n    shaggy; branches long, rough, brash, thorny, dark ash-gray,\r\n    with many, large lenticels; branchlets thick, very long,\r\n    with long internodes, green changing to dull reddish-brown,\r\n    glabrous, with raised lenticels of medium number and size;\r\n    leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval or slightly obovate, two and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, four inches long, thin; upper surface\r\n    somewhat rugose; lower surface pale green, very lightly\r\n    pubescent along the midrib; apex taper-pointed, base obtuse,\r\n    often unsymmetrical, margin coarsely and doubly serrate,\r\n    eglandular; petiole three-quarters inch long, sparingly\r\n    pubescent along one side, tinged red, glandless or with from\r\n    one to four small, globose, greenish-brown glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late, long; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, fifteen-sixteenths inch across, white, with a\r\n    disagreeable odor; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    in twos or in threes; pedicels five-eighths inch in length,\r\n    slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, thinly pubescent within,\r\n    glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, somewhat reflexed;\r\n    petals ovate or oval, irregularly crenate, tapering below\r\n    into claws of medium length and breadth; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch in length; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to or shorter than the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period of average length; one\r\n    and one-quarter inches in diameter, roundish-oval, slightly\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity very shallow, narrow, flaring;\r\n    suture an indistinct line; apex roundish; color crimson\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, very small, light\r\n    russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, five-eighths inch long,\r\n    glabrous, not adhering to the fruit; skin thick, tough,\r\n    inclined to crack under unfavorable conditions, separating\r\n    readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, fibrous, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet, strongly aromatic; good; stone semi-free,\r\n    three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in size, flattened,\r\n    roundish-oval, somewhat compressed at the base, abruptly\r\n    pointed at the apex, rough; ventral suture rather narrow,\r\n    faintly ridged; dorsal suture with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAND\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =2=:436. 1847. =2.= _Ibid._ =6=:21 fig.,\r\n    187, 294. 1851. =3.= _Am.

It is the largest of the Reine Claude plums, well molded, a\r\ngolden-yellow and when allowed to become fully ripe is most excellent in\r\nflavor and pleasing in all the flesh attributes of a good dessert plum.\r\nIt is not as high in quality as some other of the Reine Claude plums, as,\r\nfor example the Washington, with which it is often compared, for it is a\r\nlittle coarser in flesh and not as sprightly, but it is better than is\r\ncommonly thought, because it is seldom allowed to reach its best flavor\r\nby full maturity. The trees on the Station grounds are all that could\r\nbe asked for even in bearing; and elsewhere size, vigor and hardiness\r\nare usually satisfactory but productiveness is a weak point. The amateur\r\nshould always plant this variety and it would seem as if it were more\r\noften worth planting in commercial orchards.\r\n\r\nThe history of this variety is well known. The original tree grew on\r\nthe place of General Hand, on the Conestoga River, about a mile from\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, and first fruited about 1790. Thirty years\r\nlater a Mr. Miller procured grafts and succeeded in growing them. The\r\nvariety was brought to the notice of fruit-growers by E. W. Carpenter, a\r\nnurseryman of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who sent grafts to his brother,\r\nS. Carpenter, of Lancaster, Ohio, and Robert Sinclair, Baltimore,\r\nMaryland. To the latter the introduction of the Hand has been incorrectly\r\nattributed. In 1856, Hand was listed in the fruit catalog of the American\r\nPomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, hardy, variable\r\n    in productiveness; branches dark ash-gray, rough, with small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness and length, with\r\n    long internodes, green changing to brownish-red, pubescent\r\n    early in the season, becoming less so at maturity, with few,\r\n    inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, obtuse,\r\n    appressed; leaf-scars large.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate or oval, two and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, four and one-half inches long; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose, slightly hairy, with a shallow, grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex and base acute,\r\n    margin finely and doubly serrate; petiole three-quarters inch\r\n    long, thickish, pubescent, tinged red, with from one to four\r\n    small, globose, greenish-brown glands on the stalk or base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one and one-quarter inches across,\r\n    white; borne sparsely on lateral buds and spurs; pedicels\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, very pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed;\r\n    petals roundish or obovate, slightly crenate, with short, broad\r\n    claws; anthers yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch long;\r\n    pistil lightly pubescent at the base, equal to the stamens in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and three-quarters\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish-truncate or oblate, halves equal;\r\n    cavity deep, flaring; suture shallow, distinct; apex flattened\r\n    or depressed; color yellow, obscurely striped and mottled with\r\n    green, overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, whitish,\r\n    inconspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem unusually long,\r\n    averaging one and five-sixteenths inches in length, very\r\n    pubescent, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin thick, tough,\r\n    slightly astringent, separating readily; flesh golden-yellow,\r\n    juicy, somewhat fibrous, firm, sweet, with pleasant, mild\r\n    flavor; very good; stone semi-free or free, the cavity larger\r\n    than the pit, seven-eighths inch by three-quarters inch in\r\n    size, broadly oval, turgid, blunt at the base and apex,\r\n    slightly roughened; ventral suture broad, sometimes winged;\r\n    dorsal suture broadly and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIET\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

The type is that of Reine\r\nClaude, the fruit being slightly yellower; the quality is very good and\r\nthe tree-characters are good. It is doubtful, however, in spite of these\r\nattributes to recommend it, whether, with the multiplicity of plums of\r\nthis type, the variety in question can make headway in the United States.\r\nHarriet was originated by Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth, England, about\r\n1870. While considerably grown in England, it can hardly be said to be\r\none of the leading varieties in that country.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, open, productive;\r\n    branchlets thick, very short, pubescent throughout the season;\r\n    leaf-buds large, long, tipped brush-like at the apex; leaves\r\n    folded upward, oval, one and one-half inches wide, two and\r\n    three-quarters inches long, the young leaves bright red when\r\n    opening; margin serrate or almost crenate; petiole tinged red,\r\n    glandless or with one or two glands usually at the base of the\r\n    leaf; blooming season intermediate, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one inch across; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; about one and\r\n    three-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-oblate, somewhat\r\n    oblique, golden-yellow, sometimes mottled with red, overspread\r\n    with thin bloom; flesh golden-yellow, firm, sweet, pleasant in\r\n    flavor; of very good quality; stone clinging, five-eighths inch\r\n    by one-half inch in size, oval, turgid, with slightly roughened\r\n    surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKEYE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWKEYE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It is\r\ntypical of its species; and its foliage, fruit and pit in the color-plate\r\nherewith presented all represent _Prunus americana_ very well. The fruit\r\nof Hawkeye is more satisfactory than the tree, being both attractive in\r\nappearance and pleasant to eat either out of hand or cooked; the chief\r\nfault of the fruit is that it seems to be easily infected with brown-rot.\r\nThe trees are crooked in body and quite too straggling and at the same\r\ntime too dense in growth to make good orchard plants. It requires very\r\ncareful pruning and training to keep the trees at all manageable. In some\r\nof the references given above it is stated that Hawkeye on its own roots\r\nis a better tree than otherwise propagated. This variety belongs in the\r\nmiddle west but it might be grown for home use in northern New York where\r\nit is too cold for the European plums.\r\n\r\nHawkeye is a seedling of Quaker grown by H. A. Terry,[217] Crescent,\r\nIowa. It first fruited in 1882 and the following year was introduced by\r\nthe originator. In the Iowa Horticultural Society Report for 1887, Mr.\r\nTerry stated that the original tree had borne five crops in succession\r\nand he believed it to be the most valuable variety in cultivation for the\r\nWest and Northwest. The American Pomological Society placed this plum on\r\nits fruit catalog list in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, rather upright at first, becoming\r\n    spreading, low-headed, hardy, usually productive, but variable\r\n    in some locations, susceptible to attacks of shot-hole fungus;\r\n    branches numerous, dark brown, rough, thorny, with numerous,\r\n    large lenticels; branchlets long, willowy, with internodes of\r\n    medium length, green, changing to dull reddish-brown, shining,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    small, short, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves tinged red late in the season, nearly flat, oval or\r\n    slightly obovate, two inches wide, four inches long, rather\r\n    thin; upper surface dark green, smooth, glabrous, with midrib\r\n    and larger veins deeply grooved; lower surface light green,\r\n    lightly pubescent along the midrib and larger veins; apex\r\n    taper-pointed, base very abrupt, margin coarsely and doubly\r\n    serrate, the serrations often becoming spiny, eglandular;\r\n    petiole rather slender, nine-sixteenths inch in length, tinged\r\n    with pink, sparingly pubescent along one side, glandless or\r\n    with one or two globose, greenish-brown glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, showy on account of the numerous,\r\n    pure white, flat petals, with a somewhat disagreeable odor;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in pairs; pedicels\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch in length, glabrous, green with a\r\n    distinct reddish tinge on one side; calyx-tube red, broadly\r\n    obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes short, obtuse, pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, eglandular, with a hairy, serrate margin, somewhat\r\n    reflexed; petals ovate, crenate, but somewhat fringed, long and\r\n    narrowly clawed; anthers yellowish; filaments five-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period of medium length; about one\r\n    and one-eighth inches in diameter, roundish-oval or ovate,\r\n    not compressed, halves equal; cavity unusually shallow, very\r\n    narrow; suture an indistinct line; apex roundish; color dull\r\n    carmine, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, gray or\r\n    reddish, nearly obscure, with almost none around the base;\r\n    stem slender, below medium in length; skin thick, tough,\r\n    astringent, adhering; flesh pale, dull yellow, very juicy,\r\n    slightly fibrous, watery and melting, sweet at first with a\r\n    tart and somewhat astringent after-taste; good; stone adhering\r\n    to the pulp, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    roundish-oval, flattened, smooth, blunt at the base and apex,\r\n    conspicuously winged on the ventral suture, with a deep but\r\n    narrow groove on the dorsal suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Purple Egg 2.\r\n\r\nHudson is limited in cultivation, belonging almost wholly to the Hudson\r\nRiver Valley where it has long been somewhat of a favorite for both home\r\nand market planting. The variety has few qualities of fruit to commend\r\nit especially outside of the region where it is now grown and even here\r\nits value is probably overrated. The fruits are of only medium size,\r\nnot markedly attractive in appearance and the quality is below the\r\naverage among standard plums. The trees are for most part very good in\r\nconstitution and habit of growth and in particular bear very well; they\r\nhave the faults of not bearing early and of being subject to black-knot.\r\nThe variety, and perhaps it is well, is being less planted than formerly.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the origin of the Hudson except that it has been\r\ngrown in the Hudson River Valley for a good many years. About 1870 it\r\nattracted the attention of S. D. Willard of Geneva, New York, who,\r\nthinking it a valuable acquisition, commenced its propagation. In 1897,\r\nit was listed by the American Pomological Society as a successful variety\r\nfor this region. J. R. Cornell, a well informed fruit-grower of Newburgh,\r\nNew York, in a letter written February 21, 1910, says, “I recall Hudson\r\nvery distinctly as it was grown when I was a small boy over fifty years\r\nago. I would not be surprised, if the facts could be obtained, to learn\r\nthat the variety came from Europe, in fact, I incline to that opinion.”\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, very productive, hardy;\r\n    branches ash-gray, smooth except for the small, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, with long internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to brownish-red, dull, glabrous early in\r\n    the season becoming lightly pubescent at maturity, with small,\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels; leaf-buds below medium in size and\r\n    length, conical, strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, obovate or oval, two inches wide, three\r\n    and three-quarters inches long; upper surface dark green,\r\n    smooth, sparsely hairy along the grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, faintly pubescent; apex acute, base abrupt,\r\n    margin serrate, eglandular or with small dark glands; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, thick, lightly pubescent, glandless or\r\n    with from one to three greenish-yellow glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers appearing after the leaves,\r\n    one and one-eighth inches across, white; borne in scattering\r\n    clusters on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    nine-sixteenths inch long, glabrous except for a few\r\n    scattering hairs; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent\r\n    at the base; calyx-lobes obtuse, lightly pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals obovate, crenate,\r\n    tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season of medium length; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-eighth inches in size, long-oval, halves\r\n    unequal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt, regular; suture\r\n    shallow; apex slightly pointed; color dark reddish-purple\r\n    changing to purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one inch\r\n    long, sparingly pubescent; skin thin, tender, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, rather tender, sweet next\r\n    the skin but sour towards the center, aromatic; good; stone one\r\n    and one-eighth inches by five-eighths inch in size, sometimes\r\n    reddish, ovate, roughened and faintly pitted, acute at the base\r\n    and apex; ventral suture wide, with numerous ridges; dorsal\r\n    suture with a wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nHULINGS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

It is particularly agreeable\r\nto the taste because of its sprightliness, which so many plums of its\r\ntype lack. As this variety grows in New York it has much to recommend\r\nit for commercial plantations. Its lack of popularity among planters is\r\ndue somewhat to the wholesale substitution by nurserymen of spurious\r\nvarieties for it. Hulings originated early in the last century with a Mr.\r\nKeyser of Pennsylvania who grew it from seed, but Dr. W. E. Hulings of\r\nthe same state brought it to public notice.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    productive; branchlets brash, thick, pubescent; leaves\r\n    unusually large, obovate, three inches wide, six and one-half\r\n    inches long, thick, leathery, rugose; margin crenate or\r\n    serrate; petiole thick, tinged red, pubescent, with from one to\r\n    three globose glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit maturing in mid-season; about one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish, dull greenish-yellow, overspread\r\n    with thin bloom; skin thin, somewhat sour; flesh greenish,\r\n    firm but tender, sprightly; good to very good; stone clinging,\r\n    one and one-eighth inches by three-quarters inch in size,\r\n    broad-oval, medium turgid, with short, thick, slightly oblique\r\n    apex; ventral suture often winged; dorsal suture wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNGARIAN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Knoop _Fructologie_ =2=:61. 1771. =2.= Willichs _Dom.\r\n    Enc._ =4=:190. 1803. =3.= _Lond.

But it is\r\nthe fruit that differs most. Fruit and stone are more elongated than in\r\nother varieties of its supposed species and the stone is larger, flatter,\r\nmore pitted and more pointed at the base and apex. The stem, too, is\r\nlonger than in the average Domestica. These differences in leaf, fruit\r\nand pit may be well seen if the color-plate of this variety be compared\r\nwith those of well-recognized Domesticas. It is doubtful if Hungarian is\r\nworth cultivating in New York though it is larger than the commonly grown\r\nGerman Prune, with which it must be compared, and is fully equal if not\r\nbetter in quality but its type is unknown and consumers hesitate to buy\r\nthe unknown. It is well worth a place in private collections.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the history of this plum other than that it has been\r\nlong under cultivation and that, as its name suggests, it came from\r\nHungary. As in the case of many of the varieties which came from Hungary\r\nthere are several strains of this plum. The variety that is known in\r\nAmerica as Hungarian was reported by Downing in 1876, as originating in\r\nBelgium, a mistake, as this is known to have been widely spread for a\r\nlong time in Europe and European authorities trace it back to Hungary.\r\nThe Ungarish of Budd, the Hungarian Prune of the Pacific Coast which is\r\nPond Seedling, and the Date Plum, a yellow plum of Downing, all passing\r\nunder the name “Hungarian,” are distinct varieties.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with few, small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, long, with internodes of average\r\n    length, greenish-red changing to brownish-red, dull, sparsely\r\n    pubescent, with few, small, inconspicuous lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    of medium size and length, conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves drooping, folded upward, oval or obovate, one and\r\n    five-eighths inches wide, three and one-quarter inches\r\n    long, thick; upper surface dark green, rough, hairy, with a\r\n    deeply, narrowly grooved midrib; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent; apex and base acute, margin serrate, eglandular or\r\n    with small brown glands; petiole nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    pubescent, tinged red, glandless or with one or two globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, seven-eighths inch across, the buds\r\n    tinged yellow, changing to white on opening, not clustered but\r\n    distributed on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, very slender, pubescent, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, acuminate, thickly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals narrowly ovate, serrate,\r\n    converging at the base into narrow claws; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length, small, slender.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and five-eighths inches by one\r\n    inch in size, distinctly oblong, somewhat necked, swollen\r\n    on the suture side, compressed, halves unequal; cavity very\r\n    shallow and narrow, abrupt; suture shallow; apex pointed;\r\n    color dark reddish-purple, overspread with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit;\r\n    skin thin, tough, slightly sour, separating readily; flesh\r\n    yellowish-green, juicy, firm but tender, sweet, mild; good to\r\n    very good; stone semi-free to free, one and one-eighth inches\r\n    by one-half inch in size, irregular long-oval, flattened,\r\n    necked at the base, acute at the apex, with thickly pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture wide, blunt; dorsal suture with a\r\n    wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nICKWORTH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICKWORTH]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

In California Ickworth has been\r\nfound to make a very good prune and to ship very well in the green state\r\nbut here again small size debars it from great commercial value. The\r\nhabits of growth of Ickworth are very good and so markedly so that when\r\nconsidered with the late keeping qualities of the fruit, one wishes that\r\nthis variety might be bred with a larger plum of better quality with the\r\nhope of an offspring from the union of especial value as a late plum.\r\n\r\nKnight, the noted English pomologist, raised this plum from the\r\nImperatrice fertilized by Golden Drop and named it after Ickworth Park,\r\nnear Bury St. Edmunds. Knight aimed in raising this and other plums to\r\nproduce a fruit containing sufficient sugar to keep well and not shrivel.\r\nIn Ickworth he succeeded to a high degree.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, rather vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches dark ash-gray, roughened by the numerous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness and\r\n    length, with internodes of average length, green changing\r\n    to brownish-drab, dull, lightly pubescent, with numerous,\r\n    inconspicuous, small lenticels, leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, one and three-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three inches long, thick, leathery; upper surface\r\n    dark green, shining, pubescent only along the grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, sparingly pubescent; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed or acute, base acute, margin crenate, with small dark\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, thick, greenish, pubescent\r\n    along one side, glandless or with from one to four large,\r\n    reniform or globose, yellowish-brown glands usually on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate, long; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one inch across, white; borne in thin clusters\r\n    on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, below medium in thickness,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, lightly pubescent, with few glands\r\n    and marginal hairs, erect; petals roundish or roundish-oval,\r\n    finely crenate, tapering below to short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season long; one and three-eighth inches by\r\n    one and one-quarter inches in size, oval or roundish-oval,\r\n    sometimes slightly compressed, halves unequal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, wide; apex one-sided, roundish\r\n    or depressed; color purplish-red changing to purplish-black,\r\n    mottled, overspread with thick bloom, dots numerous, very\r\n    small, inconspicuous, scattered between irregular flecks\r\n    and nettings; stem thirteen-sixteenths inch long, lightly\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thick, tender,\r\n    adhering; flesh dull yellowish, juicy, sweet, mild, pleasant;\r\n    good; stone usually clinging, seven-eighths inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, irregularly oval, flattened, faintly pitted,\r\n    acute at the base, blunt at the apex; ventral suture wide,\r\n    heavily furrowed, swollen; dorsal suture widely and shallowly\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERATRICE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Quintinye _Com.

If it has any merit, it is keeping quality, the\r\nfruit hanging well on the tree and keeping well, even improving after\r\npicking.\r\n\r\nThis is an old variety, well known in Austria, France and England\r\nduring the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. Like most long-known\r\nvarieties its nomenclature is badly confused. Writers have confounded it\r\nwith Semiana, the Perdrigons, German Prune and other plums of similar\r\nappearance. Duhamel regarded this variety as Perdrigon Late, holding that\r\nthe true Imperatrice is nearly round. Calvel, also, describes a roundish\r\nplum under this name in his _Traite Complet sur les Pepinieres_. It is\r\nprobable, however, that both Duhamel and Calvel were mistaken as all\r\nother authors describe an obovate plum. This variety was introduced into\r\nAmerica early in the last century but has never become popular. It is of\r\ninterest, nevertheless, since it has been a leading European variety, is\r\na parent of a number of other varieties and its name is given to a group\r\nof plums. The American Pomological Society added it to its fruit catalog\r\nlist in 1877, but dropped it in 1883.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, productive; leaves\r\n    obovate or oval, two and one-quarter inches wide, four and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, slightly rugose; margin crenate;\r\n    petiole one inch long, thick, tinged red, pubescent, glandless,\r\n    or with one or two small glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; one and one-half inches by one and three-eighths\r\n    inches in size, roundish or ovate, purplish-black, overspread\r\n    with medium thick bloom; flesh golden-yellow, rather dry, firm\r\n    but tender, sweet; of fair quality; stone free, one inch by\r\n    three-quarters inch in size, roundish-ovate, the surfaces often\r\n    granular and with a reddish tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL EPINEUSE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

It is not surpassed\r\nin quality by any other plum of its color. It is one of the largest\r\nplums in the Prune group and is made further attractive by a handsome\r\nreddish-purple color which is lighter or darker according to the exposure\r\nof the plums to the sun. As grown in two orchards near Geneva the\r\ntree-characters are exceptionally good; the crop is so borne on the main\r\nlimbs as to be protected from the sun and the tree is particularly large\r\nand vigorous, its strong upright growth being a striking characteristic\r\nof the variety. If the variety proves to be as valuable elsewhere in the\r\nState in all characters as it is here it cannot but make a very desirable\r\nplum for the market.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Epineuse was found growing as a chance seedling about 1870\r\nin an abandoned monastery near Clairac, in the Valley of Lot, the great\r\nprune district of France. It was first brought to the United States by\r\nFelix Gillett of Nevada City, California, who received the variety with\r\nseveral others in 1883, three years previous to a similar importation\r\nmade by John Rock of Niles, California. After testing the variety Mr.\r\nGillett mentioned it, without a name, in his catalog in 1888 but owing to\r\nthe scarcity of the trees was unable to introduce it to the trade until\r\n1893 when it was sent out under the name “Clairac Mammoth,” from the name\r\nof its place of origin. In 1895 E. Smith & Sons of Geneva, New York,\r\nreceived this variety from Gillett and grew it under the name “Clarice\r\nMammoth”.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, fairly productive; branches\r\n    numerous, covered with many fruit-spurs; branchlets twiggy,\r\n    marked with scarf-skin; leaf-buds large, very free, broad\r\n    at the base; leaves folded backward, obovate, one and\r\n    three-quarters inches wide, three and one-half inches long,\r\n    thick, rugose, glabrous except along the deeply and widely\r\n    grooved midrib; petiole one inch long, tinged red, glandless\r\n    or with from one to three globose glands; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time and length; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, singly or in threes.\r\n\r\n    Fruit rather late, season short to medium in length; large,\r\n    slightly obovate, purplish-red, darker on the sunny side,\r\n    mottled, overspread with thick bloom; flesh greenish-yellow,\r\n    fibrous, rather tender, sweet, agreeable in flavor; good to\r\n    very good; stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, irregular-oval, flattened, obliquely but bluntly\r\n    contracted at the base, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    narrow, prominent, often distinctly winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL GAGE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPERIAL GAGE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

It is down in\r\nsome of the fruit books as being the largest of all the Reine Claude\r\nplums and in others as being too small to be desirable; in some, as\r\nbeing of highest quality and in others as being quite too insipid to be\r\ncalled a dessert fruit. These contradictions have arisen because the\r\nvariety grows quite differently in different soils. The Imperial Gage\r\nis best adapted to light sandy soils, growing largest and being best\r\nin quality on such soils and making the poorest show of all on heavy\r\nclay. The illustration in _The Plums of New York_ shows it as it grows\r\non an unsuitable soil—small, poorly colored, worthless for a money-crop\r\nand not very desirable for home use. The technical description is\r\nalso based on trees grown and fruit produced on soil to which it is\r\nilly-adapted. The trees from which these fruits came are nearly perfect\r\nin habits of growth, vigorous, hardy, healthy and bearing large crops of\r\nplums—such as they are. On suitable soils the variety possesses all the\r\nqualities that constitute a fine plum, the product being adapted alike\r\nfor dessert, canning, home and market. It has an especially agreeable\r\nflavor in all the various culinary preparations in which it can be used.\r\nIts capriciousness does not warrant its being largely planted but for\r\nselected locations it will prove a most valuable fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Princes in their nursery at Flushing, Long Island, New York, about\r\nthe year 1790, planted the pits of twenty-five quarts of the Green Gage\r\nplum and from these produced, among others, a plum which they called the\r\nWhite Gage. William R. Prince, in order to distinguish this variety from\r\nthe other Gage plums, changed the name to Prince’s Imperial Gage, now\r\nshortened to Imperial Gage. In 1852, the American Pomological Society\r\nplaced it on its catalog list of recommended fruits.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    very productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with conspicuous,\r\n    transverse cracks in the bark, with lenticels of medium size;\r\n    branchlets slender, short, with internodes above medium in\r\n    length, greenish-red changing to dark brownish-red, dull,\r\n    sparingly pubescent throughout the season, with small,\r\n    inconspicuous lenticels; leaf-buds medium in size and length,\r\n    conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval or slightly obovate, one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long,\r\n    thick; upper surface dark green, rugose, pubescent, with a\r\n    shallow groove on the midrib; lower surface yellowish-green,\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base acute, margin crenate,\r\n    with small dark glands; petiole one-half inch long, thick,\r\n    pubescent, purplish-red along one side, glandless or with one\r\n    or two small, globose, yellowish-green glands usually on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers one and one-eighth inches\r\n    across, white; borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels three-quarters inch long, pubescent, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent, with a swollen\r\n    ring at the base; calyx-lobes above medium in width, obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, slightly\r\n    reflexed; petals broadly obovate, crenate, tapering below to\r\n    short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the stamens; stigma\r\n    large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    one and nine-sixteenths inches in diameter, oval or slightly\r\n    ovate, compressed, halves equal; cavity very shallow and\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, often a line; apex roundish\r\n    or depressed; color dull greenish-yellow, with obscure green\r\n    streaks, mottled and sometimes faintly tinged red on the sunny\r\n    side, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    grayish, obscure, clustered about the apex; stem three-quarters\r\n    inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, firm\r\n    but tender, sweet, mild; good to very good; stone nearly free,\r\n    one inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval, flattened, with\r\n    pitted surfaces; rather blunt at the base becoming acute in the\r\n    largest fruits, very blunt at the apex; ventral suture wide,\r\n    ridged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN PRUNE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN PRUNE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Its\r\nhome is Italy and it is grown in all of the plum regions of continental\r\nEurope; is well known in England; is third or fourth in popularity in\r\nthe Atlantic States of America; is by long odds the leading plum in the\r\nPacific Northwest where it is chiefly used in prune-making and is grown\r\nsomewhat for prunes and for shipping green in California. There are\r\nseveral reasons why this plum is so popular. To begin with, it is finely\r\nflavored whether eaten out of hand, stewed or otherwise prepared for the\r\ntable or cured as a prune. The fruit is a little too tart to be ranked\r\nas a first-rate dessert plum and yet it is one of the best of the prunes\r\nfor this purpose, though it must be fully ripe to be fit for dessert; in\r\ncooking it changes to a dark, wine color, very attractive in appearance,\r\nwith a most pleasant, sprightly flavor; as a cured prune the flesh is\r\nfirm and meaty, yet elastic, of good color and a perfect freestone,\r\nmaking when cooked the same attractive looking, fine-flavored, sprightly\r\nsauce to be had from the green fruits; the prunes from this variety, too,\r\nare noted for long-keeping. In the uncured state the variety keeps and\r\nships well. The trees are usually large, hardy, productive, well formed\r\nand bear regularly; yet they are not ideal and the variety fails chiefly\r\nin tree-characters. The trees are often capricious to soil and climate,\r\ndo not always bear well, seem to be susceptible to diseases, are preyed\r\nupon by insects and suffer in particular from dry or hot weather. Were\r\nall of these troubles of the tree to befall the variety at one time it\r\nwould of necessity give way to better sorts, but happily they are to be\r\nfound for most part in illy-adapted conditions or in certain seasons; the\r\nItalian Prune well cared for in locations to which it is suited must long\r\nremain one of the leading plums despite the faults of the trees.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Prune originated in Italy at least a century ago and has\r\nlong been common in northern Italy, especially in the vicinity of Milan.\r\nThe London Horticultural Society catalog for 1831 first mentions it in\r\nEngland and the following year it was described in America by Prince\r\nas an excellent prune recently introduced from Europe. The American\r\nPomological Society recommended it in 1856 as worthy of further testing\r\nand in 1862 it was added to the fruit catalog list of this society.\r\nThe origin of the name Fellenberg, a very common synonym, is explained\r\nby Lauche[218] who says: “It came to Germany through a Mr. Fellenberg\r\nand is therefore spread under his name and also under the names\r\nSchweizerzwetsche and Fellenberger Zwetsche.” He further adds that the\r\nvariety “is still not known in Germany as it deserves, considering its\r\nquality, size and productiveness.”\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, rather vigorous, spreading or upright,\r\n    low-topped, hardy, usually productive; branches ash-gray,\r\n    smooth, with small, raised lenticels; branchlets short,\r\n    with internodes of medium length, greenish-red changing to\r\n    brownish-drab, pubescent, with small lenticels; leaf-buds of\r\n    medium size and length, conical, appressed; leaf-scars large.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, two inches wide, four\r\n    and one-half inches long; upper surface dark green, pubescent;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, heavily pubescent; apex and base\r\n    acute, margin doubly crenate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, above medium thickness, pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, with from one to three globose, greenish-brown\r\n    glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate and short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one and three-sixteenths inches across,\r\n    in the buds tinged yellow, changing to white when expanded;\r\n    borne on lateral spurs, rarely on lateral buds, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels three-quarters inch long, thick, pubescent,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent at the\r\n    base; calyx-lobes long and narrow, acute or narrowly obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces and along the glandular-serrate\r\n    margin, reflexed, inclined to curl at the tips; petals oval or\r\n    obovate, dentate, tapering to broad claws of medium length;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil\r\n    pubescent at the base, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and seven-eighths inches by one\r\n    and one-half inches in size, long-oval, enlarged on the suture\r\n    side, slightly compressed, halves unequal; cavity very shallow\r\n    and narrow, abrupt; suture shallow to medium; apex bluntly\r\n    pointed; color purplish-black, overspread with very thick\r\n    bloom; dots numerous, small, light brown, somewhat conspicuous;\r\n    stem inserted at one side of the base, one inch in length,\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, somewhat\r\n    tough, separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow changing to\r\n    yellow, juicy, firm, subacid, slightly aromatic; very good\r\n    to best; stone free, smaller than the cavity, one inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, irregular-oval, flattened, roughened\r\n    and pitted, necked at the base, abruptly tipped at the apex;\r\n    ventral suture prominent, heavily ridged, sometimes strongly\r\n    winged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPEX\r\n\r\n_Triflora_ ×\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

While in no way wonderfully remarkable, its earliness, attractive\r\ncolor, good quality and productiveness have been such that it has been\r\nretained, the cumbersome name having been changed to Japex. The majority\r\nof the characters of the variety are plainly those of Triflora, yet the\r\nfruits in appearance would lead one to call it a Domestica.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, vasiform, very productive; branches\r\n    slender, sparingly thorny; leaf-scars thick; leaf-buds\r\n    unusually short; leaves obovate or ovate, two and one-quarter\r\n    inches wide, four inches long; margin finely serrate varying to\r\n    crenate, with few dark glands; blooming season short; flowers\r\n    appearing before the leaves; borne in clusters on lateral buds\r\n    and spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and one-eighth inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish, dark purplish-red or purplish-black,\r\n    covered with medium thick bloom; flesh light yellow, very\r\n    juicy, somewhat melting, sweet next to the skin, but tart near\r\n    the pit, aromatic; good; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by\r\n    one-half inch in size, oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Prune Jefferson 11.\r\n\r\nJefferson has long been popular in America and is highly spoken of\r\nby English, French and German pomologists as well, possibly ranking\r\nhighest in the Old World of all Domesticas which have had their origin\r\nin America. The popularity of the variety is waning, however, chiefly\r\nbecause it is lacking in the essentials demanded in a market fruit. There\r\ncan be no question as to the standing of Jefferson as to quality—it is\r\none of the best of all dessert plums. Grown under favorable conditions\r\nand when fully ripe, it is a golden-yellow with a delicate blush and\r\nbloom, large for a plum in the Reine Claude group, a well-turned oval in\r\nshape, withal one of the handsomest plums. The color-plate maker did not\r\ndo it justice. It fails as a market variety because the trees are late\r\nin coming in bearing, not always certain in bearing, a little particular\r\nas to soils and not quite hardy though one of the hardiest of all Reine\r\nClaudes. Both tree and fruit are too delicate for the market-grower and\r\nthe market-men. As to its value for private places and fruit connoisseurs\r\nthere can be no doubt—it is one of the choicest. It would seem that there\r\nshould be a place for Jefferson for the fancy trade in the markets, as it\r\nwould grace the show-window of any delicatessen store; but unfortunately\r\nthere are few fruit-growers in America to cater to such a trade.\r\n\r\nJefferson was raised by a Judge Buel, Albany, New York, about 1825.\r\nThe originator presented a tree of this variety to the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society in 1829, and in 1841 trees were given to the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society which fruited in 1845. The parentage of\r\nthe variety is unknown; Floy thought it was a seedling of Washington;\r\nElliott suggested that it was “from a seed of Coe’s Golden Drop, which in\r\ngrowth and wood, it closely resembles.” In 1852, the American Pomological\r\nSociety placed this variety on its catalog list of fruits worthy of\r\ngeneral cultivation.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped,\r\n    hardy at Geneva, productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with\r\n    small, numerous, lenticels; branchlets slender, short, with\r\n    long internodes, greenish-red changing to dark brownish-red,\r\n    dull, lightly pubescent, with inconspicuous, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds large, long, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate, one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, three and three-quarters inches long, thick; upper\r\n    surface sparingly pubescent, with a grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface yellowish-green, pubescent; apex and base acute, margin\r\n    serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole three-quarters inch\r\n    long, tinged purplish-red along one side, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three small, globose, yellowish glands usually on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white; borne on\r\n    lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels three-quarters\r\n    inch long, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    glabrous, with a swollen ring at the base; calyx-lobes obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate and with fine\r\n    marginal hairs, erect; petals roundish or obovate, dentate,\r\n    tapering to very short and broad claws; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil pubescent at the\r\n    base, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-half inches in size, roundish-oval, not\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt;\r\n    suture very shallow, indistinct; apex roundish; color\r\n    greenish-yellow, changing to bronze-yellow, sometimes with\r\n    faint pink blush on the exposed cheek, often indistinctly\r\n    streaked and mottled with green before full maturity; dots\r\n    numerous, very small, gray or reddish, inconspicuous; stem\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, thinly pubescent, adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, tough, slightly adhering; flesh deep yellow,\r\n    juicy, firm but tender, sweet, mild, pleasant; very good; stone\r\n    semi-free, one inch by three-quarters inch in size, flattened,\r\n    broadly oval, abruptly tipped, with a short neck at the base,\r\n    blunt at the apex, with rough and pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture heavily furrowed, winged; dorsal suture with a wide,\r\n    deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUICY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUICY]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_ × _Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 20. 1893. =2.= _Cal.

The variety is an interesting cross, however, and has given\r\na tree so much more vigorous and so much better adapted to orchard\r\npurposes than its native parent, quite equalling the Triflora parent in\r\ntree-characters, as to suggest the value of this cross for improving the\r\ntrees of our native plums. This plum, like Golden, was grown by Luther\r\nBurbank from a seed of Robinson fertilized by pollen of Abundance. In\r\n1893 the originator sold the new variety to John Lewis Childs, Floral\r\nPark, New York, who introduced it the following year. The variety has not\r\nescaped without some confusion as to its origin for its parentage has\r\nbeen published as a cross between Robinson and Kelsey.[219]\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    branches sparingly thorny; leaves broadly oblanceolate or oval,\r\n    one and one-quarter inches wide, three inches long; margin\r\n    finely serrate or sometimes crenate, with dark reddish-glands;\r\n    petiole short, slender, with from two to five globose glands on\r\n    the stalk; blooming season of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, three-quarters inch across; borne in dense\r\n    clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in threes or fours; anthers\r\n    so numerous as to give a yellowish color to the flower-clusters.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, period of ripening long; one and\r\n    three-quarters inches by one and three-eighths inches in size,\r\n    nearly round, dark golden-yellow with bright red blush, covered\r\n    with thin bloom; flesh golden-yellow, very juicy, melting,\r\n    sweet next to the skin, but tart at the pit, aromatic; of fair\r\n    quality; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by one-half inch in\r\n    size, oval, turgid, with slightly pitted surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nKELSEY\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Kelsey’s Japan 2, 3,\r\n    5. _Sinomo_ 7. _Togari_ 7.\r\n\r\nKelsey is distinguished as the largest, the latest and the tenderest\r\nto cold of all Triflora plums in America. The variety is not much\r\nhardier than the fig and cannot be safely planted north of Washington\r\nand Baltimore. The tree is vigorous, well formed and productive, having\r\nfor its worst fault susceptibility to shot-hole fungus. The plums are\r\nlarge, very attractive in color and the flesh is firm, the plums being\r\nwell fitted for shipping, with a rich, pleasant, aromatic flavor making\r\nthe fruit very good in quality. In the South both curculio and brown-rot\r\nattack the fruits rather badly. It is unfortunate that this plum cannot\r\nbe grown in this latitude.\r\n\r\nKelsey, the first of the Triflora plums introduced into America, was\r\nbrought into the country by a Mr. Hough of Vacaville, California, in\r\n1870, through the United States consul in Japan. John Kelsey of Berkeley,\r\nCalifornia, obtained trees from Hough and propagated it in his nursery\r\nto a limited extent. The first fruit was shown by Kelsey in 1877, though\r\nfruit is said to have been produced in 1876. In 1883, W. P. Hammon and\r\nCompany, Oakland, California, secured stock of this plum from the heirs\r\nof Mr. Kelsey and the following year extensive sales were made. The plum\r\nwas named in honor of the man who did most to bring it before the public.\r\nThe American Pomological Society added the Kelsey to its fruit catalog\r\nlist in 1889. The following description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, upright, vasiform, tender, productive, an early\r\n    and regular bearer; leaves somewhat scant, small, lanceolate,\r\n    narrow; blooming season early; fruit very late, season long;\r\n    keeps and ships unusually well; large, cordate, conical, halves\r\n    unequal; suture variable in depth; apex pointed; color rather\r\n    unattractive yellow, tinged and splashed with red, often\r\n    overspread with purple, with attractive bloom, more or less\r\n    marked with conspicuous dots; stem sometimes adhering poorly\r\n    to the fruit; skin tender; flesh delicate yellow, juicy, firm\r\n    and meaty, rich, pleasant, aromatic; good to very good; stone\r\n    clinging unless well ripened, small, in an irregular cavity\r\n    larger than the pit.\r\n\r\n\r\nKERR\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

It is very productive, sometimes\r\nover-bearing, and should always be thinned. The quality of the plums\r\nis good and the fruits are attractive in appearance. The faults of\r\nthe variety are that the fruits drop as they ripen, though they color\r\nif picked green, and in some localities the tree-characters are poor.\r\nThis variety was imported from Japan by Frost and Burgess, Riverside,\r\nCalifornia, and was distributed under the group name Hattankio No. 2\r\nor Hattonkin No. 2. As Georgeson was also distributed under the same\r\nname, though under a different number, confusion resulted. To better\r\ndistinguish between the two, L. H. Bailey, in 1894, named Hattonkin No.\r\n2 Kerr, in honor of J. W. Kerr, the noted plum specialist, of Denton,\r\nMaryland. In 1899 the variety was placed on the fruit catalog list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society. The following description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, very productive; leaves large,\r\n    thick; blooming season late. Fruit early; of medium size unless\r\n    thinned, when it becomes large, variable in form, but usually\r\n    heart-shaped, yellow with thin bloom; skin thick; flesh yellow,\r\n    firm, subacid, sweet; fair to good; stone clinging, of medium\r\n    size, oval, turgid.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING DAMSON\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Watkins _Nur.

King of Damsons\r\n    1, 2.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of King Damson runs large for a Damson and the flavor is\r\nagreeable, so agreeable that the variety is really a very good dessert\r\nfruit late in the season. This Damson is little grown in America and\r\ndeserves much wider cultivation. A peculiarity of the plum is that there\r\nis always more or less doubling of the petals. Very little is known\r\nregarding the history of this excellent variety, but it seems probable\r\nthat it originated in Kent, England, where it is much grown.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, lacking in vigor, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    usually productive; branchlets slender, pubescent; leaves\r\n    folded upward, oval or slightly obovate, one inch wide, two\r\n    and three-quarters inches long; margin serrate, usually with\r\n    small dark glands; petiole with one or two glands on the\r\n    stalk; blooming season intermediate, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, usually with more than five petals, one inch\r\n    across, white with a yellow tinge at the apex; borne on lateral\r\n    spurs or from lateral buds, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; one and one-eighth inches by\r\n    seven-eighths inch in size, oval, slightly necked, black, with\r\n    thick bloom; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, firm, sprightly,\r\n    becoming sweet late in the season; of good quality; stone\r\n    clinging, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size,\r\n    irregular-ovate, slightly necked.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Pom.

The variety stands well among the purple\r\nplums growing on the grounds of this Station, but since it has been grown\r\nin America eighty years, attaining a reputation only of being mediocre in\r\nmost characters, it is probably not worth planting largely. It has many\r\nmore worthy competitors in its class and season. Hogg, in the reference\r\ngiven, says the variety was introduced by Joseph Kirke, a nurseryman\r\nat Brompton, near London, who, he says, “told me he first saw it on a\r\nfruit stall near the Royal Exchange, and that he afterwards found the\r\ntrees producing the fruit were in Norfolk, whence he obtained grafts and\r\npropagated it. But its true origin was in the grounds of Mr. Poupart, a\r\nmarket gardener at Brompton, on the spot now occupied by the lower end\r\nof Queen’s Gate and where it sprung up as a sucker from a tree which had\r\nbeen planted to screen an outbuilding. It was given to Mr. Kirke to be\r\npropagated and he sold it under the name it now bears.” The variety was\r\nintroduced into America between 1830 and 1840. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed Kirke upon its list of rejected fruits in 1858, added it\r\nto the recommended list in 1875, and displaced it in 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive;\r\n    branchlets with long internodes, dull, marked with\r\n    yellowish-brown scarf-skin; leaf-buds large, long, pointed,\r\n    free; leaves flattened, obovate or oval, one and three-quarters\r\n    inches wide, three and five-eighths inches long, thick, dark\r\n    green; margin crenate, eglandular or with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole one inch long, tinged red, glandless or with from\r\n    one to four small, yellowish-green glands; blooming season\r\n    intermediate, short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    inch across; borne on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; about one and\r\n    five-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-ovate, dark\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, fibrous, firm, sweet, mild and pleasant; good\r\n    to very good; stone nearly free, one inch by three-quarters\r\n    inch in size, ovate or oval, flattened, roughened and deeply\r\n    pitted, tapering abruptly to a short, pointed apex; ventral\r\n    suture narrow, with a short but distinct wing; dorsal suture\r\n    with a wide groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

Gifford’s La Fayette 2, 3.\r\n\r\nLafayette originated in New York sometime in the first quarter of the\r\nlast century with a Mr. Gifford from a stone of the Orleans. It did not\r\nbecome popular and was rejected by the American Pomological Society in\r\n1858, but just why it failed is not apparent, judging either from the\r\ndescriptions given in the above references or by its behavior in the\r\norchard at this Station. The fruit is good, though not remarkable for\r\nthe richness of its flavor, its size is large and the color attractive.\r\nMoreover it is so late as to stand almost alone in its season. A\r\nretrial of this old sort commercially might be worth while. The tree is\r\ninteresting because of a marked tendency in the flowers to develop petals\r\nfrom the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, round-topped, productive; branchlets\r\n    stocky, with long internodes; leaf-scars large; leaves folded\r\n    upward, oval or obovate, two inches wide, four inches long,\r\n    rugose; margin crenate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    pubescent, tinged red, having at the most three small glands\r\n    usually on the stalk; blooming season intermediate in time and\r\n    length; flowers appearing after the leaves, one and one-quarter\r\n    inches wide, creamy-white; borne in pairs; calyx-lobes long and\r\n    slender.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season long; one and one-half inches by\r\n    one and three-eighths inches in size, oval, purplish-black,\r\n    overspread with very thick bloom; flesh greenish-yellow, medium\r\n    juicy, tender, sweet, mild and pleasant; of good quality; stone\r\n    free or nearly so, one inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    irregular-oval, flattened, with an acute and slightly oblique\r\n    apex.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAIRE\r\n\r\n_Prunus orthosepala?_\r\n\r\nLaire is cultivated locally in Rooks and neighboring counties in Kansas\r\nand is highly spoken of by those who grow it. The description of the\r\nvariety is made from information sent from the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture. For a further account of this plum the reader is referred\r\nto the discussion of _Prunus orthosepala_, page 97. The name is derived\r\nfrom that of the man who first brought the plums under cultivation some\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\n    Tree dwarfish, dense-topped, not very productive; branches\r\n    spiny, zigzag; branchlets thick, reddish-brown changing to\r\n    dark brown; leaves oblong-ovate, light green, acuminate, with\r\n    margins closely serrate and seldom with glandular teeth;\r\n    petiole slender, one-half inch long, with two glands at the\r\n    apex; flowers white or tinged with pink, appearing after the\r\n    leaves; borne in threes or in fours; pedicels thick, one-half\r\n    inch long; petals narrowly clawed; stamens orange.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-eighth inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish, greenish-yellow overlaid with deep red, covered with\r\n    thick bloom; skin thick; flesh yellow, meaty, juicy, mild\r\n    subacid; good to very good; stone clinging, five-eighths inch\r\n    by nine-sixteenths inch in size, flattened, oval, with rugose\r\n    surfaces; grooved on the dorsal and ridged on the ventral\r\n    suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE ENGLISH\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Oberdieck _Deut.

As\r\ncompared with Italian Prune, the fruit of Large English runs larger,\r\nis slightly more conical, having the ventral swelling near the base,\r\nthus giving it more of a shoulder. The flavor is sweeter and richer than\r\nthat of the Italian Prune. There appear to be practically no differences\r\nbetween the trees, the foliage and the flowers of the two kinds. Wherever\r\nthe Italian is successfully grown it may be well worth while to try\r\nthe Large English. The relation the word English has to this prune is\r\nunknown. Oberdieck, in 1881, wrote that this variety resembled the\r\nItalian Prune in fruit, but differed in that it had a noticeably broader\r\nleaf; he adds “it has been incorrectly called the Swiss Prune and is much\r\nspread in Germany under the name of Italian Prune.” E. R. Lake, of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, brought it to America, in 1901,\r\nfrom the Pomological Institute, Reutlingen, Wurtemburg, Germany. Lake’s\r\nstock was tested at this Station and the variety agrees with Oberdieck’s\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n    Tree of average size, vigorous, upright-spreading,\r\n    dense-topped, productive; branchlets with, long internodes;\r\n    leaf-scars enlarged; leaves folded upward, oval or obovate,\r\n    nearly one and three-quarters inches wide, three and one-half\r\n    inches long, thick, rugose; margin crenate or almost serrate,\r\n    eglandular or with small dark glands; petiole pubescent, tinged\r\n    red, with from two to four globose glands; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time, short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one inch across; petals long, narrow, white, in the\r\n    buds tipped with yellow; borne singly or in pairs; stamens tend\r\n    to become petals.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season of medium length; one and three-quarters\r\n    inches by one and one-half inches in size, long-ovate,\r\n    purplish-black, with thick bloom; dots numerous, conspicuous;\r\n    flesh yellowish with a trace of red at full maturity at both\r\n    skin and stone, juicy, very sweet, aromatic, with a pleasant\r\n    flavor; very good to best; stone free, the cavity larger than\r\n    the pit, often brownish-red, one inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, irregular-oval, flattened, with an oblique apex; ventral\r\n    suture prominent, usually with a distinct wing; dorsal suture\r\n    with a wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE MIRABELLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

The variety is\r\npractically unknown in America, but, judging from its behavior at\r\nGeneva, well deserves widespread trial, as do all the Mirabelles. The\r\nhistory of this variety is unknown other than that it is an old sort,\r\nhaving been mentioned in the London Horticultural Society catalog as\r\nlong ago as 1831. In 1851, Barry, of Rochester, New York, described the\r\nMirabelle d’Octobre, which is identical with Late Mirabelle, and said\r\nthat it had been recently introduced from France.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size and vigor, very hardy, productive; branches\r\n    smooth; leaves small, oval, one and one-quarter inches wide,\r\n    two inches long; margin finely serrate, with few, dark glands;\r\n    petiole slender, glandless or with one or two glands at the\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; small, roundish-oval, greenish-yellow, often with\r\n    a light blush on the sunny side, covered with thin bloom; stem\r\n    short, slender; flesh yellow, very juicy, aromatic, sweet;\r\n    good; stone semi-free.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE MUSCATELLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Lucas _Vollst.

In some respects, in\r\nfruit-characters in particular, the variety is promising, but not\r\nsufficiently so to recommend it to fruit-growers, even for trial.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, productive;\r\n    branchlets thick; with short internodes, pubescent; leaf-scars\r\n    prominent; leaves drooping, folded upward, obovate, one and\r\n    five-eighths inches wide, three and three-eighths inches long,\r\n    leathery; margin crenate, eglandular or with few, small, dark\r\n    glands; petiole thick, pubescent, glandless or with from one\r\n    to three glands; blooming season intermediate in time; and\r\n    length; flowers appearing after the leaves, one inch across;\r\n    borne in scattering clusters, singly or in pairs; petals white,\r\n    creamy-white as they open; anthers tinged red.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; medium in size, roundish, slightly\r\n    truncate, purplish-brown, splashed and mottled with\r\n    russet about the base, overspread with thick bloom; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, sweet; good to very good; stone often reddish,\r\n    clinging, three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size,\r\n    somewhat flat, irregular-oval, with slightly pitted surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE ORLEANS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATE ORLEANS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Monsieur Noir Tardif 5. _Orleans\r\n    Late Black_ 5.\r\n\r\nThis is another variety having only a European reputation to recommend it\r\nin America. The fruits of Late Orleans are handsome in color and shape,\r\nbut are not large enough to enable them to compete in the markets with\r\nother late purple plums and are so poor in quality as to be worthless as\r\ndessert fruits. In Europe the variety is rated high for culinary purposes\r\nand fruit-growers there like it because it hangs well to the tree and\r\nkeeps and ships well. The trees are very satisfactory in practically all\r\nrespects. It is doubtful if the variety is worth further trial in America.\r\n\r\nLate Orleans was mentioned in the catalog of the Horticultural Society\r\nof London in 1831, but was not described. No account seems to have ever\r\nbeen published of its origin, but it is probably related to or descended\r\nfrom the Orleans since they are very similar in tree and shape of fruit,\r\ndiffering only in size and color of fruit.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, hardy, very productive;\r\n    branches smooth, dark ash-gray, with numerous, small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets medium to slender, with long internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to dull reddish-brown, dull, pubescent,\r\n    marked with gray scarf-skin and with small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    intermediate in size and length, conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, oval or obovate, one and one-quarter inches\r\n    wide, two and one-quarter inches long; upper surface sparingly\r\n    pubescent, with a deeply grooved midrib; lower surface heavily\r\n    pubescent along the midrib; apex abruptly pointed, base broadly\r\n    cuneate, margin finely crenate, with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole one-half inch long, slender, pubescent, faintly tinged\r\n    with red, glandless or with from one to four small, globose,\r\n    yellowish glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers appearing after the leaves, one inch across, white;\r\n    borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs;\r\n    pedicels one-half inch long, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube,\r\n    green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, pubescent,\r\n    glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, erect; petals\r\n    roundish or broadly ovate, entire, short-clawed; anthers yellow\r\n    with a reddish tinge; filaments five-sixteenths inch long;\r\n    pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; about one and one-half inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish, slightly compressed, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, narrow, flaring; suture a line; apex roundish;\r\n    color dark purple, overspread with thick bloom; dots few,\r\n    reddish-brown; stem three-quarters inch long, pubescent at\r\n    the base, adhering well to the fruit; skin toughish, slightly\r\n    astringent, separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, dry,\r\n    tender, sweet, mild; fair in quality; stone clinging, one\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval, flattened, slightly\r\n    roughened, blunt at the base and apex; ventral suture rather\r\n    narrow, blunt; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cultivator_ =10=:167. 1843. =2.= _Am.

It is, however, a delicious dessert fruit,\r\ndeserving to be grown in every plum connoisseur’s garden. Lawrence is a\r\nseedling of Reine Claude, and was grown by L. V. Lawrence of Hudson, New\r\nYork, some time during the second quarter of the last century. As its\r\nlarge size and superior quality became known its popularity increased,\r\nuntil it was cultivated not only in America, but to some extent\r\nthroughout western Europe. During the last twenty-five years, however,\r\nit has waned in popularity, having been superseded by better commercial\r\nvarieties, though it still ranks high as a dessert plum. The American\r\nPomological Society placed Lawrence in its catalog in 1852, and retained\r\nit there until 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, productive; trunk\r\n    and branches rough, with large lenticels; branchlets brash,\r\n    dark reddish-brown, pubescent; leaves folded upward, oval,\r\n    two inches wide, three and three-quarters inches long, thick,\r\n    leathery, rugose; margin doubly serrate, with small glands;\r\n    petiole pubescent, usually with two small glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit medium early; one and three-eighths inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish, greenish-yellow, covered with thin bloom; skin thin,\r\n    tender, slightly astringent; flesh yellowish, fibrous, tender,\r\n    sweet, aromatic; very good; stone free, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, oval, turgid, nearly smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Lovett _Cat._ fig. 44. 1890-1900. =2.= _Rural N.

The trees in\r\nthis State grow slowly and when fully grown are rather inferior. This is\r\none of the sorts recommended to be top-worked on better growing varieties\r\nbut, as has been said before in these notes, top-working in New York is\r\nfar more often a failure than a success with plums. The fruit of this\r\nvariety is unusually attractive in size and color and for quality it may\r\nbe named among the best of the red plums. Unfortunately, the variety\r\nis readily infected by the brown-rot which when epidemic cannot be\r\ncontrolled. Lincoln has been so well tested in New York without becoming\r\npopular with plum-growers that it is hardly worth recommending for\r\nfurther trial, though the fruits in particular have much merit.\r\n\r\nThis plum originated in York County, Pennsylvania, about forty-five\r\nyears ago, supposedly from seed of the Reine Claude, and was named\r\nafter Abraham Lincoln. If it be a Reine Claude seedling it comes from\r\na cross with some other variety, since it shows many characters not in\r\nReine Claude. Lincoln was introduced by J. T. Lovett and Company, Little\r\nSilver, New Jersey.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright-spreading, but somewhat\r\n    variable in habit, dense-topped, hardy, productive; branches\r\n    ash-gray, rough; branchlets somewhat slender, short, with\r\n    long internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-red, dull,\r\n    sparingly pubescent throughout the season, overspread with thin\r\n    bloom, with small, inconspicuous lenticels; leaf-buds large,\r\n    long, pointed, free; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves somewhat folded backward, oval or obovate, two inches\r\n    wide, four inches long, rather stiff; upper surface slightly\r\n    rugose, pubescent only in the shallow, grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, base\r\n    acute, margin doubly crenate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    nearly one inch long, pubescent, reddish, with from one to four\r\n    rather large, globose or reniform, yellowish glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium; flowers appearing after the leaves,\r\n    over one inch across, white; borne on lateral spurs and buds,\r\n    singly or in pairs; pedicels about seven-eighths inch long,\r\n    slender, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    thinly pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, acute, somewhat pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, with marginal hairs,\r\n    reflexed; petals oval, crenate, with claws of medium width;\r\n    anthers yellow; filaments three-eighths inch or more in length;\r\n    pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; somewhat variable but averaging\r\n    about two inches by one and five-eighths inches in size,\r\n    oblong-oval, slightly necked, halves usually equal; cavity\r\n    very shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow; apex roundish\r\n    or depressed; color light or dark red over a yellow ground,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, light\r\n    russet; stem one inch long, lightly pubescent, adhering poorly\r\n    to the fruit; skin thick, rather sour, separating readily;\r\n    flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, coarse and fibrous, firm but\r\n    tender, sweet, mild, pleasant; good to very good; stone nearly\r\n    free, one and one-eighth inches by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    long-oval, flattened, necked at the base, blunt at the apex,\r\n    with markedly rough and deeply pitted surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    narrow, distinctly furrowed, with a short wing; dorsal suture\r\n    with a narrow groove of medium depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOMBARD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOMBARD]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kenrick _Am.

Variegated Plum 1.\r\n\r\nThe Lombard plum is known by all. It is not as largely planted in New\r\nYork as a few other varieties, but it is probably more widely grown than\r\nany other plum if the whole continent be considered. The preeminently\r\nmeritorious characters which enable it to take first place in American\r\nplum-growing are: The elasticity of its constitution whereby it\r\nadapts itself to widely different soils and climates; the robustness,\r\nhealthiness, productiveness and regularity in bearing of its trees; the\r\nfact that the fruits are comparatively free from the scourge of the\r\ncrescent sign, plum-curculio; and, lastly, its showy fruits tempting\r\nto the eye and readily salable. The tree-characters of Lombard are all\r\ngood, making so superior a tree that it, more than any other variety, is\r\nrecommended as a stock upon which to graft weak-growing plums. It is a\r\nvirile variety and from it have come a considerable number of offspring\r\nmostly from self-fertilized seeds which have given us several nearly\r\nrelated varieties and strains. There are also a few very good cross-bred\r\nplums of which Lombard was one parent. Lombard would be preeminently the\r\nplum “for the millions” were it not for a fatal fault—it is very poor\r\nin quality. Canned, cooked, preserved or spiced, it does very well, but\r\nas a dessert fruit it falls in a category with the Ben Davis apple and\r\nKieffer pear, “good-looking but poor.” The variety ripens so early as to\r\ncome in direct competition with the peach and this hurts it not a little\r\nas a market plum. To be at its best the crop should be thinned and should\r\nbe allowed to ripen fully on the trees. Lombard is now much used in the\r\ncanneries in New York and is also planted in home orchards where only\r\nhardy plums stand the climate. In the markets it is usually a low-priced\r\nplum.\r\n\r\nLombard was raised by Judge Platt, Whitesboro, New York, from seed\r\nreceived from Amsterdam (References, 2). Another writer (References,\r\n10) reports that the trees were brought over from Holland by some of\r\nthe earliest Dutch settlers of Utica and Whitesboro. The name was given\r\nto the plum about 1830 by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in\r\nhonor of Daniel Lombard of Springfield, who was the first to propagate\r\nthe variety in that state. It was previously well known in New York as\r\nBleecker’s Scarlet (References, 3), but was never formally described\r\nunder that name which must, therefore, though the older, be discarded. In\r\n1856, it was placed on the recommended list by the American Pomological\r\nSociety. Several varieties, as Communia, Tatge, Spanish King and Odell,\r\nare very similar, if not identical to the Lombard and, consequently,\r\nhave caused much confusion in the nomenclature of the variety. This\r\nsimilarity is probably explained by the fact that the Lombard produces\r\nseedlings very nearly true to type. Professor J. L. Budd, in a letter\r\nwritten in 1898 to this Station, says, “The fruit of Communia is much\r\nlike that of Lombard, but this can be said of a hundred or more east\r\nEuropean varieties.” Professor Budd had traveled much in Europe and knew\r\nplums very well. His statement, therefore, is entitled to credence and\r\nindicates, together with other circumstances, that Lombard is one of an\r\nold group of plums the varieties of which are very similar.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, round-topped, very hardy, productive;\r\n    branches stocky, dark ash-gray, smooth, with few, small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, medium to long, with long\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to dull brownish-red,\r\n    marked with gray scarf-skin, glabrous early in the season,\r\n    becoming pubescent at maturity, with a few, inconspicuous,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and length, conical,\r\n    appressed; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves long-oval or long-obovate, one and five-eighths inches\r\n    wide, three and one-half inches long, medium to thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, thinly pubescent, with a grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, lightly pubescent; apex acute,\r\n    base somewhat tapering, margin often doubly serrate, eglandular\r\n    or with small, dark glands; petiole one-half inch long, thick,\r\n    tinged red, pubescent, glandless or with one or two globose,\r\n    yellowish-green glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers appearing after the leaves,\r\n    one inch across, the buds creamy-yellow, changing to white on\r\n    expanding; borne in clusters on short, lateral spurs, singly or\r\n    in pairs; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch long, slender, nearly\r\n    glabrous; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, pubescent only\r\n    at the base; calyx-lobes obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, strongly reflexed; petals oval, entire or\r\n    occasionally notched at the apex, short-clawed; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil pubescent only on\r\n    the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and three-quarters\r\n    inches by one and five-eighths inches in size, oval or\r\n    roundish-oval, slightly compressed, halves unequal; cavity\r\n    narrow, abrupt, roundish; suture usually a line; apex roundish\r\n    or flattened; color light to dark purplish-red, overspread\r\n    with thick bloom; dots numerous, small, light russet; stem\r\n    slender, three-quarters inch long, adhering well to the fruit;\r\n    skin thin, tender, separating readily; flesh yellowish, juicy,\r\n    slightly fibrous, firm and sweet, mild; inferior in quality;\r\n    stone semi-free to free, one inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    dark colored, oval, flattened, roughened; base and apex acute;\r\n    ventral suture slightly furrowed, acute; dorsal suture widely\r\n    and rather deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG FRUIT\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Wild Bros. _Cat._ 27. 1892. =2.= _Cornell Sta.

On the grounds of this Station and\r\nelsewhere in New York where tested, the trees are unproductive, the crop\r\ndrops badly and the fruits are small and poor in quality.

Despite the fact that it must compete for favor with such estimable\r\nplums as Reine Claude, Washington and Hand, belonging to the same group\r\nwith these, it is still much grown in England and is well thought of for\r\nhome use in America. Hardly in accordance with its reputation, it was\r\nrejected by the American Pomological Society in 1858 for a place in its\r\nlist of fruits. Lucombe originated as a seedling about 1825 with a Mr.\r\nLucombe of Lucombe, Prince and Company, nurserymen, at Exeter, England,\r\nand was first described by Lindley in 1830 in the _Pomological Magazine_.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, of medium vigor, upright-spreading, productive;\r\n    branches covered with numerous fruit-spurs; twigs very short,\r\n    with heavy pubescence; leaves one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, three and one-quarter inches long, dark green; margin\r\n    finely serrate or crenate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    pubescent, glandless or with one or two small glands usually\r\n    at the base of the leaf; blooming season intermediate, short;\r\n    flowers appearing after the leaves; petals with a yellowish\r\n    tinge as the buds unfold; borne on long naked spurs with tufts\r\n    of leaves and flowers at the ends, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, period of ripening long; one and\r\n    three-eighths inches by one and one-half inches in size,\r\n    roundish-oblate or roundish-obovate, greenish-yellow, becoming\r\n    golden-yellow, indistinctly splashed and streaked with green,\r\n    covered with thin bloom; flesh golden-yellow, firm, sweet,\r\n    pleasant, mild; very good; stone free, three-quarters inch by\r\n    five-eighths inch in size, roundish, slightly necked, with\r\n    pitted surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAQUOKETA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAQUOKETA]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

Nearly all of the plums brought in from the wild in\r\nAmerica have so much astringency, most of it coming from the skins, that\r\nthey are impalatable to some. Now and then a variety is nearly free from\r\nthis disagreeable taste and Maquoketa is one of these. The quality, as\r\na dessert fruit, is very good for a native and the fruits keep and ship\r\nwell. In the South the plums are subject to both curculio and brown-rot.\r\nThe trees, like those of nearly all of the Miner-like plums, are rather\r\nbetter formed and more adaptable to orchard conditions than those of\r\nother species. After the Americana and Nigra plums, Maquoketa is one of\r\nthe hardiest of our native varieties, growing even in Minnesota. The\r\nvariety belongs in the South and Middle West and there are few, if any,\r\nplaces in New York where it is worth growing.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this plum is uncertain. It is reported in the references\r\ngiven as a native found on the banks of the Maquoketa River in eastern\r\nIowa and also as a Miner seedling grown under cultivation. It has been\r\nknown to fruit-growers since about 1889.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, spreading, low-topped, open,\r\n    hardy, variable in productiveness, susceptible to attacks of\r\n    shot-hole fungus, the trunk shaggy; branches slender, rough,\r\n    zigzag, with few thorns, dark, dull ash-gray, with numerous\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, long, with internodes of medium\r\n    length, green, changing to dull reddish-brown, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous, conspicuous, small, slightly raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds very small, short, obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, broadly lanceolate,\r\n    peach-like, one and three-quarters inches wide, four and\r\n    one-half inches long; upper surface light green, changing\r\n    to a dull red late in the fall, glossy, glabrous, with a\r\n    narrowly grooved midrib and veins; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    thinly pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base rather abrupt;\r\n    margin with serrations in two series, with very small, black\r\n    glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, tinged with dull red,\r\n    hairy, with from one to four globose, rather large, dark\r\n    brownish-yellow glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one inch across, yellowish as the buds begin\r\n    to open, changing to white, with a disagreeable odor; borne in\r\n    clusters on lateral spurs and buds, varying from two to four\r\n    flowers in a cluster; pedicels five-eighths inch long, slender,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, narrowly campanulate,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, slightly obtuse, nearly glabrous\r\n    on the outer surface, but pubescent within, serrate, with\r\n    dark colored glands and marginal hairs, reflexed; petals\r\n    oval or ovate, with long, tapering claws of medium width,\r\n    sparingly hairy at the base; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch in length; pistil glabrous, slender,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripening period short; below medium in size, ovate\r\n    or roundish-ovate, halves equal; cavity shallow, rather wide,\r\n    rounded, flaring; suture a distinct line; apex roundish or\r\n    slightly pointed; colors some time before fully ripe becoming\r\n    dark carmine, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, small\r\n    to medium, light brown, clustered about the apex; stem rather\r\n    slender, glabrous, parting readily; skin thick, tough,\r\n    astringent, semi-adherent, removing a thin layer of pulp when\r\n    detached; flesh deep yellow, juicy, coarse, fibrous, nearly\r\n    melting next to the skin, becoming firmer toward the center,\r\n    sweet at first but astringent near the pit, with a strong\r\n    flavor; inferior in quality; stone adhering, of medium size,\r\n    oval, turgid, bluntly pointed at the base and apex, with\r\n    slightly roughened surfaces; ventral suture acute, ridged;\r\n    dorsal suture a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANNA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIANNA]\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_ × ?\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

First,\r\nbecause it has long been an enigma which has baffled both horticulturists\r\nand botanists; second, because it is extensively used as a stock upon\r\nwhich other kinds of plums are propagated. In 1884, a plum of unknown\r\nspecies was introduced to the trade. Some said the new variety belonged\r\nto _Prunus cerasifera_ and others that it was an offspring of some native\r\nspecies. The characters of the first named species are so apparent in\r\nMarianna that all are now agreed that this variety is from either a self\r\nor a cross-fertilized seed of _Prunus cerasifera_; if the latter the\r\nother parent must have been some native species, the particular variety\r\npossibly being Wild Goose, one of the Munsoniana plums. Its behavior on\r\nthese grounds, its robustness and semi-sterility and its not fitting\r\nexactly into any known species, mark it as a hybrid. A curious character\r\npeculiar to this variety is that it grows very readily from cuttings and\r\nfor this reason it is a cheap stock for plums of all kinds and is used\r\neven for peaches and apricots. Besides rooting readily, the Marianna\r\ndoes not sprout and may be budded as late or later than the peach. It is\r\nchiefly used in propagation in the South, but, for reasons stated in the\r\ndiscussion of stocks in Chapter II, the Marianna is not now employed by\r\nnurserymen as largely as formerly, though there are still conditions in\r\nwhich it is the best of stocks. The tree is a handsome ornamental at any\r\nseason of the year and its broad, spreading top makes it a good shade\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nMarianna originated as a seedling in a mixed orchard belonging to Charles\r\nG. Fitze, Marianna, Polk County, Texas; its parentage is unknown. The\r\noriginator considered it a seedling of Wild Goose, but, it is probably\r\nan offspring of DeCaradeuc and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph,\r\nundoubtedly a hybrid. In 1884, Charles N. Eley, Smith Point, Texas,\r\nintroduced the Marianna to fruit-growers; in 1889 it was placed on the\r\nfruit catalog list of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, broad, spreading, open and flat-topped,\r\n    hardy, unproductive, comparatively free from insects or\r\n    diseases; trunk rough; branches numerous, usually smooth,\r\n    but sometimes roughened by the cracking of the bark, thorny,\r\n    dark ash-gray, with numerous, very large, raised lenticels;\r\n    branchlets slender, twiggy, with internodes of medium length,\r\n    green changing to dull reddish-brown, with gray scarf-skin,\r\n    glabrous, with conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    very small and short, obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, elongated-oval, one and one-eighth\r\n    inches wide, two and five-eighths inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface smooth, glabrous, with a shallow groove on the midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, lightly pubescent along the midrib\r\n    and larger veins; apex and base acute, margin very finely\r\n    serrate, with small, black or amber glands; petiole slender,\r\n    three-quarters inch long, pubescent along one side, usually\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to three very small,\r\n    globose, greenish-brown glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, three-quarters inch across, white;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral spurs, in twos or in threes;\r\n    pedicels three-eighths inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute,\r\n    sparingly pubescent, ciliate, erect; petals very small,\r\n    separated from each other, broadly oval, entire, tapering to\r\n    narrow claws; anthers yellowish; filaments three-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season of medium length; one and one-eighth\r\n    inches or more in diameter, oval or roundish-oval, often not\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt,\r\n    regular; suture a line; apex roundish or blunt-pointed; color\r\n    bright, light red changing to darker red, overspread with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, small, light russet, conspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the apex; stem slender, five-eighths inch\r\n    long, glabrous; skin tough, bitter, inclined to crack under\r\n    unfavorable conditions, parts readily; flesh yellow, tinged\r\n    red under the skin and next to the stone, unusually juicy,\r\n    fibrous, watery and melting, sweet next to the skin, but acid\r\n    near the pit, sprightly; inferior in quality; stone clinging,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, elongated-oval,\r\n    blunt-pointed, surfaces pitted; ventral suture blunt, wide,\r\n    slightly ridged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARU\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Its quality is not high and\r\nit comes in season about with Abundance which surpasses it in nearly all\r\ncharacters. The variety was introduced by Luther Burbank and is said to\r\nhave been imported by him about 1885. In Japan this name is applied to\r\nany round plum, but so far in America it has been restricted to this\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, lacking in vigor, broad-vasiform, dense-topped,\r\n    unproductive, somewhat susceptible to attacks of shot-hole\r\n    fungus; trunk and branches rough; branchlets twiggy, marked\r\n    with thin, russety scarf-skin, glabrous, with large, prominent\r\n    lenticels; leaves folded upward, oblanceolate, peach-like,\r\n    thin, one and three-eighths inches wide, three inches long;\r\n    upper surface yellowish-green late in the season; margin very\r\n    finely serrate, with small glands; petiole with from one to six\r\n    glands usually on the stalk; blooming season early; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, three-quarters inch across; borne\r\n    in clusters on lateral spurs, in threes or fours; pistil longer\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, about one and one-quarter inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-cordate, dull red, with medium thick bloom; flesh deep\r\n    yellow, tender and melting, sweet next the skin, but slightly\r\n    astringent near the pit; poor in quality; stone clinging,\r\n    five-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval or roundish,\r\n    turgid, with rough surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYNARD\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus simonii_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Vt.

The season follows\r\nClimax, a period when there is a dearth of Triflora plums. Maynard has\r\nbeen so widely advertised that it is hardly necessary to say that it\r\nis worthy of trial. The variety was first fruited in 1897 by Burbank\r\nafter which it was tested by him for five years and was then sold to the\r\nOregon Nursery Company by whom it was introduced in 1903. It was named\r\nby the originator in honor of Professor T. S. Maynard, then in charge of\r\nhorticulture in the Massachusetts Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, open-topped, productive;\r\n    branchlets thick, dark chestnut-red; leaves obovate, one and\r\n    one-half inches wide, three and one-half inches long, thin;\r\n    margin finely serrate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    slender, glandless or with one or two small glands usually at\r\n    the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early; about one and three-eighths inches in diameter,\r\n    roundish-truncate, dark red, changing to purplish-black,\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; flesh reddish, with a tinge\r\n    of yellow near the pit, fibrous, tender and melting,\r\n    sweet, aromatic; good to very good; stone semi-clinging,\r\n    three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in size, broadly oval,\r\n    turgid, blunt at the base and apex, with pitted surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture prominent, with deep furrows and with a narrow,\r\n    blunt wing; dorsal suture acute or with an indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcLAUGHLIN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McLAUGHLIN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =1=:195 fig. 54. 1846. =2.= Cole _Am.

MacLaughlin 12.\r\n    _MacLanglin_ 12.\r\n\r\nMcLaughlin stands well up with the best of plums in quality and when\r\nwell grown is very attractive in appearance. Its flesh is sweet and yet\r\nnot so sweet as to cloy the appetite; in flavor it is rich and delicate\r\nand while somewhat like that of Reine Claude, is different, so that the\r\nvariety has a taste quite of its own; though the juice is abundant, the\r\nflesh is not watery; the texture is neither too coarse nor too fine, too\r\nfibrous nor too mealy, but in a fruit rightly matured is most pleasantly\r\nmelting. There are few other plums in which the characters pleasing to\r\nthe taste exist in such nice proportions. McLaughlin is a little smaller\r\nthan some other plums of its group, but is quite large enough for a\r\ndessert plum. Unless at its best, it is not as attractive in color as\r\nJefferson, Washington, Reine Claude and some others of its type, but at\r\nits very best, it is unsurpassed by any other plum in coloring; it has in\r\nperfection the delicate yellow skin which belongs to the Reine Claudes\r\nupon which is marbled tints of white, yellow and crimson, the blending\r\nof which the illustration shows but poorly. The fruit of McLaughlin has\r\nits imperfections, however. The flesh clings tenaciously to the stone,\r\nis too melting to keep or ship well and rots badly on the tree. These\r\ndefects debar the variety in America, with present market demands, from\r\ncommercial plantations. The tree is above the average in size and vigor\r\nand is as hardy as any, more so than most of the Reine Claude varieties.\r\nIt comes in bearing early and is rather productive. The place for this\r\nplum, from the summary of its characters, is apparent at once—in the home\r\norchard and in the collection of the fruit connoisseur.\r\n\r\nMcLaughlin was raised by James McLaughlin of Bangor, Maine, first\r\nfruiting about 1840. The parentage of the variety is disputed, but no\r\none doubts that it contains Reine Claude blood, though the tree is too\r\nvigorous to have been raised from the Reine Claude self-pollinated.\r\nJudging from the tree-characters, it may have sprung from the Washington\r\nor Imperial Gage fertilized by the Reine Claude. The American Pomological\r\nSociety, in 1852, placed the McLaughlin with the plums that promised\r\nwell, and at the next meeting added it to the recommended list.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, variable in vigor, spreading, open-topped,\r\n    hardy, medium to productive; branches stocky, ash-gray, smooth,\r\n    with small, indistinct lenticels; branchlets few, thick, short,\r\n    with short internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-drab,\r\n    lightly pubescent, with numerous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    above medium in size, long, pointed, appressed; leaf-scars\r\n    swollen.\r\n\r\n    Leaves oval, two inches wide, three and one-half inches long,\r\n    thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, covered with fine\r\n    hairs; lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed, base acute, margin crenate, with small, black glands;\r\n    petiole five-eighths inch long, thick, pubescent, tinged red,\r\n    with one or two small, globose, yellowish glands usually at the\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, fifteen-sixteenths inch across, white, with yellow\r\n    tinge near the apex of the petals; borne on lateral spurs and\r\n    buds, singly or in pairs; pedicels one-half inch long, thick,\r\n    very pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic, pubescent;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, sparingly pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, reflexed;\r\n    petals obovate, crenate, tapering below to short, broad claws;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous except at the ovary, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and five-eighths inches by one\r\n    and seven-eighths inches in size, roundish-oblate, compressed,\r\n    halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow;\r\n    apex flattened or depressed; color greenish-yellow, blushed and\r\n    mottled with red, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    small, light colored; stem thick, three-quarters inch long,\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit, surrounded at the cavity\r\n    by a fleshy ring; skin tough, slightly adhering; flesh light\r\n    yellow, juicy, sweet, mild and pleasant; very good; stone\r\n    clinging, one inch by three-quarters inch in size, irregular\r\n    broad-oval, very blunt at the base and apex, heavily wrinkled\r\n    and deeply pitted; ventral suture narrow, distinctly furrowed,\r\n    winged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLEBURG\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDDLEBURG]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _W.

The fruits may be surpassed somewhat by other purple plums in\r\nappearance but few of them are better in quality, either for dessert\r\nor for cooking. It is especially valuable too, because it ripens late,\r\nhangs well to the tree and ships and keeps well, in the latter respect\r\nequalling the best of the prunes. Out of a collection of about three\r\nhundred sorts on the Station grounds, this would undoubtedly be chosen\r\nas the favorite purple plum of its season. The trees, while of only\r\nmedium size, are robust, healthy, hardy and usually productive. In\r\nSchoharie County, eastern New York, where this variety originated and\r\nhas long been grown, black-knot is usually epidemic and Middleburg and\r\nPalatine are said to be the sorts most free from the disease—so free that\r\nneither is much troubled by it. From its behavior here it is certain\r\nthat, belying the looks of either fruit or tree, Middleburg will improve\r\nupon acquaintance and that when well known it will be wanted in home\r\ncollections at least and more than likely some commercial fruit-growers\r\nwill find it profitable.\r\n\r\nMiddleburg came from Middleburg, Schoharie County, New York, where it was\r\nfound as a chance seedling. Mr. S. D. Willard, of Geneva, first called\r\nattention to the variety in 1886 at a meeting of the Western New York\r\nHorticultural Society. Its origin is much older than the date given, as\r\nit has been extensively grown in Schoharie County for a half-century or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n    Tree above medium in size, vigorous, round and open-topped\r\n    hardy, productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with small\r\n    lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness and length, with\r\n    long internodes, greenish-red, changing to brownish-red,\r\n    overspread with light bloom, dull, somewhat pubescent, with\r\n    few, inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size\r\n    and length, pointed, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and one-half inches wide, three\r\n    and one-half inches long, rather thick, stiff; upper surface\r\n    dark green, sparingly pubescent on the grooved midrib and\r\n    larger veins; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex\r\n    and base acute, margin doubly serrate, with a few, small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole eleven-sixteenths inch long, pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-brown glands on the stalk or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early to medium, short; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one inch across, white, borne in\r\n    scattering clusters on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs;\r\n    pedicels three-quarters inch long, overspread with fine,\r\n    short pubescence, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    pubescent at the base; calyx-lobes obtuse, thinly pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, somewhat reflexed;\r\n    petals roundish or obovate, entire, with short, abrupt claws;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, equal to the stamens in length, with a large,\r\n    pubescent ovary.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season long; one and five-eighths inches by\r\n    one and one-half inches in size, distinctly oval, compressed,\r\n    halves equal; cavity very shallow, narrow, flattened; suture\r\n    usually lacking; apex roundish; color varies from light to\r\n    deep purplish-red, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    small, russet, inconspicuous; stem one inch long, thinly\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, slightly\r\n    sour, separating readily; flesh light yellow, rather juicy,\r\n    somewhat coarse, firm, sprightly when first mature, becoming\r\n    sweetish, strongly aromatic, pleasant flavored; very good;\r\n    stone semi-free or free, one inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    irregular-oval, with pitted surfaces, slightly acute at the\r\n    base and apex; ventral suture narrow, winged, faintly ridged;\r\n    dorsal suture acute or with a shallow, narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLER SUPERB\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\nOf the two hundred and more varieties of plums which have fruited on the\r\nStation grounds, Miller Superb is one of the finest for dessert. The\r\nvariety is of the Reine Claude group and is fully up with the best of\r\nthese plums—all noted for high quality. In size and appearance, the plums\r\nresemble those of the well-known Bavay though usually larger. This plum\r\noriginated with Colonel Charles Miller of Geneva, New York, when, is not\r\nknown. About 1889, M. F. Pierson of Stanley, New York, secured cions of\r\nthe plum from Colonel Miller and named the variety Miller Superb. It has\r\nnever been introduced and is grown locally only to a very limited extent.\r\nIts large size, productiveness and superior quality should recommend it\r\nstrongly for more general cultivation.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    productive; branches rough as they approach the rough trunk;\r\n    leaf-scars enlarged; leaves flattened, oval, two inches wide,\r\n    three and three-quarters inches long; margin serrate or\r\n    crenate, with few, small, dark glands; petiole long, thick,\r\n    reddish, pubescent, with from one to three glands usually\r\n    at the base of the leaf; blooming season of medium length;\r\n    flowers appearing after the leaves, one inch or more across,\r\n    white with yellowish tinge; borne on lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; one\r\n    and three-quarters inches by one and five-eighths inches in\r\n    size, roundish-oval or roundish-ovate, golden-yellow, mottled\r\n    and splashed with green and sometimes with a blush on the\r\n    exposed cheek, overspread with thin bloom; dots conspicuous;\r\n    flesh light golden-yellow, juicy, firm but tender, sweet,\r\n    pleasant in flavor; very good; stone clinging or semi-clinging,\r\n    one inch by five-eighths inch in size, ovate or oval, somewhat\r\n    flattened, usually winged; dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILTON\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_ × ?\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It thus escapes frosts, when,\r\nfor example, its parent, Wild Goose, might be injured; and its early\r\nripening prolongs the season for native plums. The fruits are large,\r\nof very good quality, though a little too juicy for pleasant eating\r\nor to ship well, very attractive in appearance, and, more important\r\nthan all else for the regions in which it is likely to be grown, it\r\nis comparatively free from rot. Unfortunately, the flesh clings most\r\ntenaciously to the stone even after cooking. In its fruit-characters,\r\nMilton strongly resembles one of the Mineri plums, but the tree is very\r\nmuch like that of Wild Goose, its known parent. In New York, Milton is\r\none of the best of the native plums but it is hardly so considered in\r\nthe Middle West, where these plums are most grown, judging from the\r\ndiscussions of it in the references given above.\r\n\r\nMilton, a seedling of Wild Goose grown by H. A. Terry, Crescent, Iowa,\r\nfirst fruited in 1885. The originator believed that the other parent was\r\nan Americana, but from the characters of the tree it was more likely one\r\nof the Mineri plums. The American Pomological society added Milton to its\r\nfruit catalog list in 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, round and dense-topped,\r\n    symmetrical, hardy at Geneva, productive, healthy; branches\r\n    brash, rough, thorny, dark brownish-gray, with numerous,\r\n    large, narrow and much elongated lenticels; branchlets very\r\n    slender, willowy, medium to long, with internodes of average\r\n    length, greenish-red, changing to dull reddish-brown, thinly\r\n    pubescent, with numerous, conspicuous, small, slightly raised\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, broadly lanceolate or oblanceolate,\r\n    peach-like, one inch wide, three inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface smooth, with a grooved midrib; lower surface thinly\r\n    pubescent on the midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed;\r\n    base slightly acute, margin serrate or crenate, with numerous,\r\n    minute, dark glands; petiole seven-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    slender, reddish, lightly pubescent, glandless or with from one\r\n    to four small, globose, yellowish-brown glands usually on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, three-quarters inch across, the buds creamy when\r\n    opening, changing to white, odor disagreeable; borne in thin\r\n    clusters on lateral spurs and buds, singly, in pairs, or in\r\n    threes; pedicels three-quarters inch long, very slender,\r\n    glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, slightly obtuse, pubescent within, with\r\n    dark colored glands and marginal hairs, erect; petals oval,\r\n    entire or deeply indented, tapering below to long, narrow claws\r\n    margined with few scattering hairs near the base; anthers\r\n    yellow with a faint trace of red; filaments five-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil slender, glabrous, equal to the stamens in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and three-sixteenths\r\n    inches by one inch in size, oval, slightly compressed, halves\r\n    equal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt, regular; suture a\r\n    distinct line; apex roundish or slightly pointed; color dark\r\n    red, covered with thin bloom; dots very numerous, medium to\r\n    large, russet, conspicuous; stem slender, seven-eighths inch\r\n    long, adhering fairly well to the fruit; skin thin, tough,\r\n    astringent, separating readily; flesh yellowish, the juice\r\n    given off readily leaving a tough, fibrous pulp, sweet next\r\n    the skin, but rather acid at the center, of pleasant flavor;\r\n    fair to good; stone adhering, three-quarters inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, long-oval, slightly elongated at the base and\r\n    apex, somewhat flattened, surface broken into irregular ridges;\r\n    ventral suture blunt, faintly ridged; dorsal suture a narrow,\r\n    shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINER\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Horticulturist_ =22=:332. 1867. =2.= _Am.

Though lacking but a few years of having been in the\r\nhands of civilization a century (the Indians from whom it appears to have\r\nbeen taken had possibly cultivated it longer), Miner is still a standard\r\nvariety and while not the best of the group of which it is the type, it\r\nis one of the best. This variety has the further distinction of being,\r\nafter Wild Goose, the parent of more cultivated offspring than any other\r\nof our native plums and must be credited with having transmitted its\r\ncharacters, those of the tree being especially good, to a high degree.\r\nMiner is one of the parents of more than two score of named native\r\nplums in nearly all of which the resemblances to each other and to the\r\nparent are very marked. The variety is not grown, so far as is known,\r\nin New York and the trees on the grounds of this Station not being in\r\nbearing, it was impossible to illustrate the fruit in _The Plums of New\r\nYork_ though to do so was greatly desired. In the Middle West, Miner is\r\nprobably as widely disseminated and as largely grown as any other plum,\r\nbeing particularly adapted to the northern limits of the cultivation of\r\nits species. The tree of this variety is robust, healthy, probably better\r\nin habit of growth for orchard management than any other of the native\r\nplums, and usually productive. The fruits are good in quality, attractive\r\nin appearance, comparatively curculio-proof and are especially suited for\r\nculinary uses. The variety is unproductive unless cross-fertilized.\r\n\r\nSeveral accounts are given of the origin of Miner, none of which can be\r\naccurately verified at this late date. When all of the data is compared\r\nand that which is reliable is put together, the history of the variety\r\nruns about as follows: In 1813 William Dodd, an officer under General\r\nJackson, found this plum growing in a Chicasaw Indian plantation at a\r\nplace called Horse Shoe Bend, on the Tallapoosa River, Alabama. The\r\nplums were so attractive in size and excellent in quality that he saved\r\nseeds of the variety and in 1814 planted them in Knox County, Tennessee.\r\nWhen the trees came in bearing and their merits were discovered, the new\r\nplum was at once in demand and was rather widely distributed in Knox\r\nand neighboring counties under the names “Old Hickory” and “General\r\nJackson.” In 1823 or 1824, Dodd moved to Springfield, Illinois, taking\r\nsprouts of this plum with him. Dodd’s young trees did not thrive and he\r\nasked a brother in Tennessee who was moving to Illinois, to bring more\r\nsprouts of the new plum. The brother, instead of going to Springfield,\r\nwent to Galena, Illinois, taking with him the sprouts of Old Hickory.\r\nThese fell into the hands of Judge Hinckley, who distributed them among\r\nhis friends, one of whom, a Mr. Townsend, propagated the variety rather\r\nextensively. At Galena, from the circumstances just noted, the variety\r\nwas called “Hinckley” and “Townsend.” Meanwhile, the trees which the\r\nfirst Mr. Dodd had taken to Springfield came into bearing and the variety\r\nwas propagated and distributed in the neighborhood as “William Dodd” and\r\n“Chicasaw Chief.” A relative of the Townsends, at Galena, took trees of\r\nthis plum to Lancaster, Wisconsin, where they were propagated by a man\r\nnamed Joel Barber. Barber named the plum after his father-in-law, a Mr.\r\nMiner, and this name, out of the dozen or more that have been given it,\r\nis the one under which the plum is now universally known. During the\r\nprocess of dissemination the variety received several other local names\r\nas Isabel, Gillett, Robinson and Parsons.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, hardy at Geneva, unproductive\r\n    unless cross-pollinized; branches smooth, reddish-brown,\r\n    thorny; branchlets slender, long, with long internodes,\r\n    greenish-red, changing to brownish-red, glossy, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous, small, grayish lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    obtuse, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling late, long-oval or obovate, peach-like, one\r\n    and five-eighths inches wide, four inches long, thick; upper\r\n    surface roughish, glabrous except for a few hairs on the\r\n    narrowly grooved midrib; lower surface very thinly pubescent;\r\n    apex acuminate, base abrupt and nearly acute, margin serrate,\r\n    with small glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, pubescent\r\n    on the upper surface, often tinged red, with from two to four\r\n    reniform or globose, dark amber glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers late, often self-sterile, medium to large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit somewhat late; medium in size, roundish-ovate or\r\n    roundish-oblong; cavity shallow, narrow, regular; suture\r\n    indistinct; apex pointed; color dull, dark red, appearing some\r\n    time before maturity, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    minute, yellowish, conspicuous at first, becoming duller; stem\r\n    slender, long, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin thick,\r\n    tough, somewhat astringent; flesh pale amber yellow, juicy,\r\n    nearly tender, mild, aromatic; good in quality; stone adhering,\r\n    small to medium, roundish-oval, flattened, pointed at the base\r\n    and apex, with nearly smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRABELLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Merlet _Abrege des bons fruits_ 1675. =2.= Rea _Flora_\r\n    207. 1676. =3.= Quintinye _Com.

The small, round, yellow fruits are attractive\r\nin appearance, and the sweet, pleasant flavor of the variety should fit\r\nit admirably in this country for the purposes for which it is so largely\r\ngrown by the French. The trees are small but vigorous and healthy, the\r\nlast two qualities having suggested in Europe their use as stocks, to\r\nwhich purpose they are sometimes put in France when a dwarfing stock is\r\nneeded. European writers say that the variety may be reproduced from seed.\r\n\r\nMirabelle is a very old plum; it was noted by the pomological writers in\r\nthe latter part of the Seventeenth Century and since that date it has\r\nheld a conspicuous place in all of the European plum literature. This\r\nvariety, though probably sparingly introduced in America at different\r\ntimes, has never been widely cultivated and is not now offered for sale\r\nby any of the nurserymen whose catalogs have been consulted for _The\r\nPlums of New York_.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, round and open-topped, hardy; branches dark\r\n    ash-gray, smooth, with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets\r\n    slender, of medium length, dull brownish-red, thorny, glabrous,\r\n    with numerous, small, indistinct lenticels; leaf-buds of medium\r\n    size and length, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, one and one-half inches wide, three\r\n    inches long, folded upward, oval, rather thin; upper surface\r\n    medium green, smooth, with few hairs scattered along the\r\n    grooved midrib; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent;\r\n    apex acute, base abrupt, margin crenate, with small, black\r\n    glands; petiole one-half inch long, tinged red along one side,\r\n    glandless or with from one to three small, globose glands\r\n    usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers appearing in mid-season, after the leaves,\r\n    seven-eighths inch across, white with a yellow tinge as the\r\n    buds unfold; borne on lateral spurs and buds, in twos or\r\n    threes; pedicels three-quarters inch long, slender, thickly\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, broadly obconic,\r\n    glabrous except at the base; calyx-lobes of medium width,\r\n    obtuse, glandular-serrate, pubescent on both surfaces;\r\n    reflexed; petals oval, crenate, tapering to short, broad claws;\r\n    anthers yellow with a tinge of red; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, period of ripening of medium length;\r\n    seven-eighths inch in diameter, roundish-oval, slightly necked,\r\n    swollen on one side, compressed, halves equal; cavity very\r\n    shallow and narrow, abrupt; suture indistinct; apex roundish\r\n    or depressed; color light golden-yellow, sometimes blushed and\r\n    mottled with red on the exposed cheek, overspread with thick\r\n    bloom; dots numerous, small, whitish, inconspicuous, clustered\r\n    at the apex; stem slender, three-quarters inch long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering poorly to the fruit; skin thin, tough, not astringent,\r\n    separating readily; flesh light yellow, not very juicy, firm,\r\n    but tender, sweet, mild, but pleasant; good to very good; stone\r\n    free, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size, oval,\r\n    blunt, broadly ridged along one edge, roughish.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRACLE\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_ × _Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rural N.

About 1887, Luther Burbank imported from a French\r\nnurseryman a tree of the Prunier San Noyeau or Stoneless plum known as\r\na curiosity in Europe for at least three centuries. With this fruit he\r\ncrossed several of the best European varieties, producing hybrids which\r\nfirst fruited in 1893. Although there were several stoneless fruits in\r\nthis lot, none were of any value and it was not until 1899 that one\r\nappeared worthy of consideration. In this seedling, developed from Agen\r\npollen, the stone is represented by a small, hard scale near the base\r\nof the kernel. Burbank sold the new plum in 1903 to the Oregon Nursery\r\nCompany by whom it was introduced in 1906. The following description is\r\ncompiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree somewhat dwarfish, producing a roundish, compact head,\r\n    very productive. Fruit larger than Agen, oblong, dark blue\r\n    covered with thick bloom; cavity medium; stem short; flesh\r\n    yellow, sweet, juicy; good; stone lacking, the kernel lying\r\n    naked in the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONARCH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONARCH]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Prune Monarque 2.\r\n\r\nNo plum of recent introduction has so quickly attained popularity as\r\nthe Monarch. Of the great number of plums imported from the Old World,\r\nthis is one of the few which has proved worthy of a place with the best\r\nAmerican varieties for American conditions, an illustration of the\r\nimportance of testing all foreign fruits. The plate shows the fruit of\r\nthis variety well, though the plums look smaller in the illustration than\r\nin nature—an illusion always accompanying the reproduction in exact size\r\nof the photograph of a round object. The nicely turned form and the rich\r\npurple color of this plum make it a handsome fruit. While the quality\r\nis not of the best, Monarch ranks high among purple plums as a dessert\r\nfruit, few plums of this color being especially palatable to eat out of\r\nhand. The variety is not remarkable for any of its tree-characters, yet\r\nthey average well with other plums and, with those of the fruit, make\r\na variety quite above the average and give it a place among the best\r\ncommercial sorts. Monarch is now so widely disseminated and so largely\r\ngrown in New York, that we shall know shortly whether it is to hold the\r\nhigh place it has so quickly taken among market plums in this State.\r\n\r\nMonarch, a seedling of the Autumn Compote, was grown by Thomas Rivers,\r\nSawbridgeworth, England and was introduced by the originator in 1885.\r\nEnglish publications described and figured this variety in 1883 but there\r\nare no notices of it in American pomological literature until 1897. Two\r\nyears later it was placed on the fruit list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety catalog and recommended for the north-eastern section of the\r\nUnited States. Notwithstanding the fact that the variety is relatively\r\nnew, it is now offered for sale by nearly every nurseryman in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped,\r\n    hardy at Geneva, usually productive; branches ash-gray,\r\n    smooth, with small lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness\r\n    and length, with internodes of average length, greenish-red,\r\n    changing to brownish-drab, dull, thickly pubescent, with\r\n    obscure, small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, pointed,\r\n    appressed; leaf-scars somewhat swollen.\r\n\r\n    Leaves broadly oval, wide, medium in length, thick, somewhat\r\n    stiff; upper surface rugose, covered thinly with hairs; lower\r\n    surface pubescent; apex abruptly pointed, margin serrate or\r\n    crenate, eglandular; petiole short, thick, heavily pubescent,\r\n    lightly tinged red, glandless or with one or two large,\r\n    reniform or globose, greenish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    white; pedicels three-quarters inch in length, thick,\r\n    pubescent, green; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, pubescent;\r\n    calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, thickly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals oval, crenate, tapering\r\n    to short and very broad claws; anthers yellow; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil pubescent, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late; two inches by one and three-quarters inches in\r\n    size, roundish-oval, halves unequal; cavity deep, medium to\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, often a line; apex roundish or\r\n    flattened; color dark purplish-red, often with russet flecks\r\n    scattered over the surface, overspread with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, small, reddish-brown, conspicuous, clustered about\r\n    the apex; stem thick, three-quarters inch long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tender, slightly\r\n    astringent, separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy,\r\n    somewhat fibrous, tender, sweet next to the skin, pleasantly\r\n    tart towards the center, aromatic; good; stone clinging, one\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, long-oval, turgid, roughened\r\n    and pitted, pointed at the base, blunt at the apex; ventral\r\n    suture rather wide, shallowly furrowed, blunt; dorsal suture\r\n    with a wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONROE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Its fruit-characters are\r\nnot as satisfactory as those of several other varieties of its species.\r\nDr. Wayland of Cadiz, Kentucky, according to T. V. Munson, grew a lot of\r\nseedlings from pits of wild plums found in his vicinity and either from\r\nthis lot or from a seedling from them, came the Moreman. The variety\r\nwas introduced by W. F. Heikes in 1881. It was listed in the catalog of\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1899. The following description is\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, spreading, hardy, productive; leaves of medium\r\n    size, coarsely serrate; petiole usually glandless. Fruit late;\r\n    small, roundish, bright red, bloomless; stem long, slender;\r\n    dots numerous, yellow; flesh firm, yellow, pleasant in flavor;\r\n    quality fair; stone small, roundish, clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOROCCO\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

Its faults are small size, an\r\ninsipid flavor and poor keeping qualities. Morocco is one of the oldest\r\nof the cultivated plums. It has been known in Europe for three centuries\r\nat least and is undoubtedly much older, its early history not having\r\nbeen written. It is not known when the variety was introduced into this\r\ncountry but it has been grown in the Southern States for many years under\r\nthe name Mogul. About 1894, it was reintroduced from England by the W. &\r\nT. Smith Nursery Company of Geneva, New York, under the name Mogul.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, rather tender to cold,\r\n    productive; branchlets covered with heavy pubescence; leaves\r\n    oval, one and three-quarters inches wide, three inches long;\r\n    margin finely serrate or crenate; petiole short, thick, with\r\n    one or two globose glands usually at the base of the leaf;\r\n    blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    white or creamy as the buds unfold; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripening period short; below medium in size, round\r\n    to oval or obovate, purplish-black, covered with thick bloom;\r\n    dots conspicuous; flesh light golden-yellow, rather dry,\r\n    moderately firm, sweet next to the skin, but rather acid near\r\n    the center; poor; stone clinging, medium to small, oval or\r\n    ovate, flattened, with rough surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTTLED PRUNE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\nThis plum is placed among the leading varieties only that a full\r\ndescription of it may be put on record. The fruit is attractive in\r\ncolor but is inferior in quality. These defects are so prominent that\r\nthe variety can hardly become popular. The Mottled Prune originated in\r\nWaterloo, New York, as a chance seedling in 1887; it was introduced by E.\r\nSmith & Sons, Geneva, New York.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, round and open-topped, very productive; branches\r\n    stocky; branchlets heavily pubescent; leaves folded backward\r\n    or flattened, oval or obovate, one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, three and one-half inches long, thick and leathery,\r\n    rugose; margin crenate, with few, small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    thickly pubescent, dull dark red, glandless or with from one\r\n    to three smallish glands usually on the stalk; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time and length; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, white; borne in scattering clusters\r\n    on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels very\r\n    pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and three-quarters\r\n    inches by one and one-half inches in size, ovate, dark\r\n    purplish-red, somewhat mottled, covered with thick bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, conspicuous; flesh pale yellow, juicy, firm, sweet,\r\n    mild; of fair quality; stone free, one inch by three-quarters\r\n    inch in size, oval, flattened, strongly roughened; ventral\r\n    suture deeply furrowed, often with a short wing; dorsal suture\r\n    with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYROBALAN\r\n\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

The Myrobalane\r\n    Plum 4.\r\n\r\nMyrobalan is a group name rather than a varietal one. Plums of this\r\ngroup are grown from seeds and many varieties have appeared during the\r\nlast three centuries, differing in color, shape, stone and in many minor\r\ncharacters. The red and reddish-purple plums and the round ones are\r\napparently the most numerous though there are frequent references to the\r\nWhite Myrobalan and to heart-shaped fruits in this group. For a further\r\ndiscussion of these plums see _Prunus cerasifera_. The Myrobalan plums\r\nare used largely as stocks in the propagation of plums and closely allied\r\nplants; occasionally they are used for culinary purposes though with\r\nrather poor results.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECTARINE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Pom.

These names have been interchanged indiscriminately\r\nfor the three plums and it is now difficult to separate the varieties,\r\nespecially as they are very similar. The Goliath, however, may be\r\nseparated from the other two by its pubescent shoots, which the others do\r\nnot have. The Peach plum is the largest of the three and has a reddish\r\ncast whereas the Nectarine and Goliath are dark purple. The earlier\r\nwriters knew a Nectarine as a synonym of Peach but it was not until 1830\r\nthat the Nectarine was finally described as a separate variety. Nectarine\r\nis of unknown origin. The following description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, round-topped, productive; leaves large, oval;\r\n    branches glabrous. Fruit early; large, roundish, flattened at\r\n    the ends, dark purple with thin bloom; flesh greenish-yellow,\r\n    tinged red at maturity, rather coarse, sprightly; fair to good;\r\n    stone of medium size, compressed, oval, semi-clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWARK\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\nThis fruit has little to recommend it to the commercial plum-grower; it\r\nis small in size and unattractive in color; the quality, however, is very\r\ngood and the variety is worth planting for home use.

Its fruits are characterized by a firm, meaty flesh, which\r\nfits it well for shipping and storing; the plums are also attractive in\r\nshape and color but are too small and too low in quality to make the\r\nvariety a first-rate one. The trees are large and vigorous and in all\r\nrespects very satisfactory orchard plants. Both fruits and trees are\r\nusually reported as fairly free from diseases and insects. While the\r\nvariety is gradually going out it still has some value for its crops\r\nand ought to make a good parent from which to breed a race of vigorous,\r\nfirm-fleshed Munsonianas.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this plum is uncertain. In 1867 a Mr. Elliott of Cleveland,\r\nOhio, reported in the _Horticulturist_ that he had received samples of\r\nthe “Newman Plum” from D. L. Adair, Esq., of Hawesville, Kentucky, and\r\ngave a brief description of the fruit which seems to tally with that of\r\nthe variety under discussion. The American Pomological Society added this\r\nplum to its fruit catalog list in 1875 and removed it in 1891.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, low and flat, dense-topped,\r\n    hardy at Geneva, productive, subject to attacks of shot-hole\r\n    fungus, the trunk shaggy; branches dark ash-gray, rough and\r\n    shaggy, thorny, zigzag, with numerous, rather inconspicuous,\r\n    large, elongated lenticels; branchlets very slender, twiggy,\r\n    with internodes of average length, greenish-red, changing to\r\n    dark brown, glabrous, with few, conspicuous, large, raised\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, nearly free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves lanceolate, peach-like, one and one-quarter inches\r\n    wide, four inches long, thin; upper surface smooth, glabrous,\r\n    with a grooved midrib; lower surface glabrous except along\r\n    the midrib and larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base acute,\r\n    margin finely crenate, with small, amber glands; petiole\r\n    slender, seven-eighths inch long, lightly pubescent along one\r\n    side, reddish, glandless or with from one to four very small,\r\n    globose, yellowish-red glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, three-quarters inch across, in the buds tinged yellow,\r\n    changing to white on expanding, odor disagreeable; borne in\r\n    clusters on lateral spurs and buds, in twos or in threes;\r\n    pedicels eleven-sixteenths inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    small, narrow, slightly obtuse, pubescent on the inner surface,\r\n    glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, erect; petals ovate\r\n    or oval, crenate, tapering at the base into long, narrow claws;\r\n    anthers yellow, tinged with red; filaments five-sixteenths inch\r\n    long; pistil slender, glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period very long; one inch by\r\n    seven-eighths inch in size, strongly oval, not compressed,\r\n    halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring; suture\r\n    a distinct dark red line; apex depressed; color bright\r\n    currant-red, with thin bloom; dots grayish, rather conspicuous,\r\n    clustered near the apex; stem very slender, seven-eighths inch\r\n    long, glabrous, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, very\r\n    tough, astringent, separating readily; flesh deep yellow,\r\n    juicy, tender and melting, sweetish next to the skin, but tart\r\n    at the center; fair in quality; stone clinging, five-eighths\r\n    inch by three-eighths inch in size, long-oval, turgid, necked\r\n    at the base, blunt-pointed at the apex, with finely pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture narrow, inconspicuous; dorsal suture\r\n    with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ULM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW ULM]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Minn.

The plums are further distinguished by a peculiar\r\nflavor, somewhat suggesting that of the mandrake, pleasant to some but\r\ndisagreeable to others. The flesh is a little too juicy for pleasant\r\neating but the fruits ship well, the tough, thick skin firmly holding its\r\ncontents. The fruits, however, do not keep well, for, despite the thick\r\nskin, the spores of the brown-rot find entrance and thrive so that the\r\nvariety rots badly. The trees are hardy and productive but ill-shaped and\r\nhard to manage in either the orchard or the nursery for which reason the\r\nculture of the variety is discouraged by nurserymen and it is now almost\r\nimpossible to buy New Ulm trees. The illustration of this variety shows\r\nwell the characters of the western type of _Prunus americana_ in leaf,\r\nfruit and stone.\r\n\r\nNew Ulm was raised from seed of a wild variety that grew in the\r\nneighborhood of the originator and introducer, C. W. H. Heideman, New\r\nUlm, Minnesota. The fruit was exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair in\r\n1890 where it attracted much attention, being the largest plum of fifty\r\nvarieties exhibited. In 1899 the American Pomological Society placed the\r\nvariety on its fruit catalog list. The Minnesota State Horticultural\r\nSociety, in spite of the fact that this plum has gained a good reputation\r\nfor its size and productiveness, removed it from its recommended fruit\r\nlist in 1904 because of the difficulty of growing the trees in the\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, spreading and drooping, irregular, low and\r\n    dense-topped, undesirable in habit of growth, hardy, usually\r\n    productive, subject to attacks of shot-hole fungus; branches\r\n    very rough and shaggy, zigzag, thorny, dark ash-gray, with\r\n    large lenticels; branchlets thick, long, willowy, with long\r\n    internodes, green, with a faint yellow tinge, changing to\r\n    light and dark, dull reddish-brown, glabrous, with numerous,\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, pointed,\r\n    strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves drooping, folded upward, oval or ovate, two inches wide,\r\n    four and three-eighths inches long, thin; upper surface dark\r\n    green, changing to reddish-yellow late in the season, glabrous,\r\n    with a grooved midrib; lower surface silvery green, lightly\r\n    pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base abrupt, margin coarsely\r\n    and doubly serrate, eglandular; petiole slender, five-eighths\r\n    inch long, pubescent, tinged with red which deepens in color\r\n    at the base, glandless or with from one to three globose,\r\n    greenish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Flowers intermediate in time and length of blooming season,\r\n    appearing after the leaves, showy on account of the numerous\r\n    pure white petals, one and one-sixteenth inches across, white;\r\n    borne in dense clusters on lateral spurs and buds, usually in\r\n    threes; pedicels seven-sixteenths inch long, thick, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube red, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    long, narrowly obtuse, lightly pubescent on the inner surface,\r\n    thickly pubescent along the glandular-serrate margin, erect;\r\n    petals oval, entire or incised, tapering below to narrow\r\n    claws of medium length and with reddish base; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments seven-sixteenths inch in length; pistil glabrous,\r\n    much shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, intermediate in length of ripening period;\r\n    about one and three-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-ovate,\r\n    halves equal; cavity markedly shallow, very narrow; suture a\r\n    line; apex roundish or slightly pointed; color carmine over a\r\n    yellow ground, overspread with thin bloom; dots very numerous,\r\n    russet; stem five-eighths inch long, glabrous, adhering\r\n    somewhat to the fruit; skin thick and tough, astringent,\r\n    adhering strongly; flesh golden-yellow, very juicy and\r\n    fibrous, granular, tender and melting, sweet with a strong\r\n    aromatic flavor; good; stone adhering, seven-eighths inch by\r\n    nine-sixteenths inch in size, oval, slightly flattened, blunt\r\n    at the base, pointed at the apex, with smooth surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture distinctly winged; dorsal suture narrow, shallow,\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

At best this sort\r\ncan hardly be called more than a curiosity, though an interesting one,\r\nof use, if at all, only for cooking and as a long-keeping, rot-resistant\r\nplum. It will add novelty to any amateur’s collection because of the\r\nsize, shape, color, flavor and red flesh of the fruits.\r\n\r\nThis variety was grown by Burbank and introduced by him in 1899 under the\r\nname Sultan. H. E. Van Deman, in the _Rural New Yorker_ (References, 1),\r\nsays that Occident is a cross between Wickson and Satsuma and that the\r\nname Garnet which he suggested, owing to the color of its flesh and skin,\r\nhad been accepted by Mr. Burbank. About two months later the Division of\r\nPomology of the United States Department of Agriculture called attention\r\nto the fact that “Garnet” had been previously given to another variety\r\nand the name was changed to Sultan. Waugh in 1899 substituted “Occident”\r\nfor Sultan as the latter is the name of a European plum; Waugh’s name\r\nhas been accepted by all recent writers. Occident undoubtedly contains\r\nSatsuma blood but it has but few characters that suggest Wickson, and\r\nif a cross, which is likely, the other parent is undeterminable. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, slow of growth, straggling, somewhat variable\r\n    in habit, late in coming into bearing, productive; leaves\r\n    numerous, large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens with Burbank, keeps and ships unusually well,\r\n    resistant to rot; large, roundish; cavity of medium depth;\r\n    suture shallow, distinct; color dark red over a greenish\r\n    ground; dots many, yellowish; stem thick, short, adhering to\r\n    the fruit; skin somewhat thin, tough, slightly astringent;\r\n    flesh dark red, firm, sweet, rather acid, changing to subacid\r\n    as maturity advances, sprightly; good to very good; stone free\r\n    or semi-clinging, of medium size, roundish, turgid, winged,\r\n    rough.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCHEEDA\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cornell Sta.

We must rank\r\nit in this State as second rate among Americanas. Ocheeda was found by P.\r\nL.

At present October is the nearest approach to the plum\r\ndesired but because of several faults it falls considerably short of\r\nfilling the need. The fruits are large, attractive-looking, fairly\r\nsuitable for dessert, very good for culinary purposes, hang well to the\r\ntree and keep and ship much better than the average Triflora variety;\r\nbut still they are not far enough from mediocrity to make the variety\r\nespecially desirable. The trees are well shaped, usually robust and\r\nhealthy and the fruit is well borne on lateral spurs distributed over\r\nthe old wood; but in New York, at least, the trees are very tardy in\r\ncoming in bearing and cannot be depended upon to bear satisfactory crops\r\nregularly—a fatal fault in a Triflora plum. October might be sparingly\r\nplanted in New York to the pleasure of the amateur and possibly to the\r\nprofit of the commercial fruit-grower who has a good local market.\r\n\r\nOctober is said to be a cross of Satsuma and a seedling Triflora plum; it\r\nwas first fruited by Luther Burbank in 1892 and was introduced by Stephen\r\nHoyt’s Sons, New Canaan, Connecticut, in 1897. The variety was named\r\nOctober Purple by Burbank but “Purple” has been dropped in accordance\r\nwith the rules of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree variable in size and vigor, upright-spreading,\r\n    open-topped, hardy for a Triflora, not uniform in\r\n    productiveness, healthy; branches rough, dark, dull ash-gray,\r\n    with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets slender, long, with\r\n    internodes of average length, greenish-red changing to dull\r\n    reddish-brown, often with a green tinge on the winter shoots,\r\n    glabrous; lenticels numerous, small; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, sparse, folded upward, oval or obovate,\r\n    one and three-eighths inches wide, three and one-quarter inches\r\n    long, thin and leathery; upper surface slightly rugose, with\r\n    a broad groove on the lightly pubescent midrib; lower surface\r\n    very thinly pubescent; apex and base acute, margin glandular,\r\n    doubly serrate or crenate; petiole one-half inch long, hairy\r\n    along the upper side, green, with from one to three small,\r\n    globose, yellowish glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early to medium, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing before the leaves, thirteen-sixteenths inch across,\r\n    white; borne in dense clusters on lateral spurs and buds,\r\n    in pairs; pedicels one-half inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    obtuse, glandular-serrate, with numerous hairs along the edge,\r\n    pubescent, somewhat erect; petals broadly ovate, entire,\r\n    tapering to short, blunt claws; anthers yellow; filaments\r\n    three-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season or later, ripening period long; one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-cordate or slightly\r\n    oblate, halves unequal; cavity deep, wide, flaring, with\r\n    streaks radiating from the cavity; suture shallow or a line;\r\n    apex roundish to slightly pointed; color dark red over a\r\n    yellowish-green ground, with bloom of medium thickness; dots\r\n    numerous, large, russet, conspicuous, clustered about the\r\n    apex; stem somewhat slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tough, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh light yellow frequently tinged with red, very\r\n    juicy, slightly fibrous, variable in firmness, sweet, mild,\r\n    lacking the strong characteristic Triflora flavor; good; stone\r\n    clinging, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    roundish-oval, blunt but with a small tip, somewhat rough,\r\n    ridged along the ventral, grooved on the dorsal suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nOGON\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ga.

Ogden 1. _Ogon_ 5. _Shiro Smomo_ 6. _Yellow Nagate_ 2.\r\n\r\nOgon, the Japanese for gold, is the name for one of the comparatively\r\nfew varieties of _Prunus triflora_ having a yellow color. This variety\r\nis further distinguished by being the only freestone sort of its species\r\nunder cultivation in America. Ogon also has a flavor quite distinct,\r\nresembling somewhat that of the apricot, which is agreeable to some and\r\nnot so to others; as the variety grows on the grounds of this Station it\r\ncannot be considered of high quality even for an early plum. The fruits\r\ncrack rather badly on the tree and seem to be unusually susceptible to\r\nthe attacks of curculio. In some of the references given, it is reported\r\nas making a poor tree and as having a weak constitution, and practically\r\nall agree that the variety is unproductive. These faults preclude its\r\nuse in commercial plantations. The variety is distinct and interesting\r\nnot only in its fruits but in its flowers which bear comparatively few\r\nstamens, many of which are abortive and show all degrees between perfect\r\nstamens and perfect petals.\r\n\r\nOgon was imported from Japan by H. H. Berger and Company, San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia. It was first mentioned as the Ogden in the Georgia\r\nHorticultural Society Report for 1886 and in the 1888 report of the\r\nsame Society it was described as a new fruit. In 1897, the American\r\nPomological Society added Ogon to its fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, vasiform, dense-topped, hardy\r\n    at Geneva, unproductive; branches slender, roughened by\r\n    numerous spurs, sparingly thorny, dark gray, with numerous,\r\n    small lenticels; branchlets sometimes swollen at the tips, of\r\n    medium thickness and length, with internodes of average length,\r\n    dark brown often with some green, partly overspread with gray\r\n    scarf-skin, glossy, glabrous; lenticels medium in number and\r\n    size, raised; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, plump, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves few, oblanceolate, peach-like, variable in size,\r\n    averaging one and one-eighth inches wide, four inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface light green, shining, glabrous, narrowly\r\n    grooved along the midrib; lower surface light yellowish-green,\r\n    glabrous except at the base of the veins; margin finely\r\n    crenate, with small, dark amber glands; petiole one-half inch\r\n    long, glandless or with from one to four globose, greenish\r\n    glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, thirteen-sixteenths inch across, white;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral spurs and buds, in threes or in\r\n    fours; pedicels five-sixteenths inch long, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute,\r\n    slightly glandular-serrate, faintly pubescent, erect; petals\r\n    broadly ovate, entire, tapering below to short claws; anthers\r\n    yellowish, with a little pink; filaments three-sixteenths inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and one-quarter inches by one\r\n    and three-quarters inches in size, roundish-oblate, oblique,\r\n    halves equal; cavity narrow, regular, flaring; suture variable\r\n    in depth, prominent; apex roundish or slightly flattened; color\r\n    lemon-yellow, with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, whitish,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem slender, one-half inch long, glabrous,\r\n    separating readily; skin thin, tough, astringent, inclined to\r\n    crack, slightly adhering; flesh pale or amber-yellow, not as\r\n    juicy as many of the Trifloras, firm and meaty, sweet, mild; of\r\n    fair quality; stone free, five-eighths inch by one-half inch in\r\n    size, roundish-oval, turgid, blunt but with a small short tip,\r\n    oblique, slightly pitted; ventral suture faintly ridged and\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture not grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Taking its characters all in\r\nall it cannot compete with even the average varieties of the plums with\r\nwhich it should be compared. This variety was introduced by A. J. Downing\r\nwho secured it from a Mr. Teller of Rhinebeck, Dutchess County, New York.\r\nAlthough Rhinebeck is probably its place of origin, it is not likely that\r\nTeller first grew the variety since it was quite generally disseminated\r\nin that vicinity at the time of its introduction. It is fast passing from\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, productive; branches roughened\r\n    by the raised lenticels; branchlets numerous, pubescent; leaves\r\n    oval or slightly obovate, two inches wide, four inches long,\r\n    thick; margin crenate or serrate, with small grands; petiole\r\n    tinged red, pubescent, with from two to three globose glands.\r\n\r\n    Fruit matures in mid-season; about one and one-half inches in\r\n    diameter roundish-truncate, light amber-yellow with a blush,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; stem slender, adhering strongly to\r\n    the fruit; flesh pale yellow, firm, sweet; of good quality;\r\n    stone free or nearly so, one inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, obovate, acute at the apex, blunt at the base, with\r\n    thickly pitted surfaces; ventral suture wide, usually blunt but\r\n    sometimes distinctly winged; dorsal suture with a deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nOREN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OREN]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It is\r\none of the best of the Americanas in both fruit and tree. The fruits are\r\nlarge and of good shape, perhaps a little dull in color and not quite\r\nas good in quality as a few other Americanas but still averaging very\r\nwell in all fruit-characters. The flesh is very nearly free from the\r\nstone. The trees are typical of the species, shaggy of trunk and limb,\r\nstraggling and unkempt in growth of top, but hardy, robust, healthy and\r\nreliable in bearing. It would seem as if this variety is rather too good\r\nto be allowed to pass out of cultivation until there are more Americanas\r\nthat are better.\r\n\r\nOren was taken from the wild in Black Hawk County, Iowa, about 1878, by\r\nJ. K. Oren. Mr. Oren grew trees of this plum on his farm and permitted\r\nall who came to take sprouts, cions and seed until the variety was very\r\ngenerally disseminated locally. Who introduced it to the trade and when\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, spreading, low, dense-topped, hardy, often\r\n    unproductive; branches roughish, slightly zigzag, thorny, dark\r\n    ash-brown, with small lenticels; branchlets slender, long,\r\n    twiggy, with internodes of average length, green changing to\r\n    dark chestnut-brown, glabrous, with large, conspicuous, raised\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, oval or obovate, two inches wide,\r\n    three and three-quarters inches long; upper surface dark\r\n    green changing to golden-yellow late in the season, smooth\r\n    and shining, with a narrow, grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, lightly pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base\r\n    abrupt, margin coarsely serrate, the serrations ending in sharp\r\n    points, eglandular; petiole five-eighths inch long, thick,\r\n    tinged red, thinly pubescent, glandless or with one or two\r\n    prominent, greenish-brown glands.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral spurs and buds, in pairs or in\r\n    threes; pedicels five-eighths inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    green, tinged with red; calyx-tube red, campanulate, enlarged\r\n    at the base, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, somewhat obtuse,\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces and on the margin, reflexed; petals\r\n    ovate, somewhat crenate or fringed, tapering below to long,\r\n    narrow claws, sparingly hairy along the edge of the base;\r\n    anthers yellow; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; one\r\n    and three-sixteenths inches in diameter, roundish, usually\r\n    truncate and slightly oblique, compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity very shallow, flaring; suture a line; apex roundish\r\n    or flattened; color dull light or dark red over a yellow\r\n    ground, mottled, with thick bloom; dots numerous, very small,\r\n    light russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, five-eighths inch\r\n    long, glabrous; skin tough, astringent, adhering; flesh dark\r\n    golden-yellow, juicy, fibrous, soft and melting, sweet; fair to\r\n    good; stone semi-free, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, irregularly roundish or ovate, flattened, blunt at the\r\n    base and apex, with smooth surfaces; ventral suture strongly\r\n    winged; dorsal suture acute, with a narrow and shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nORLEANS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Quintinye _Com.

Red Orleans Plum 6.\r\n\r\nIn Europe Orleans is one of the most renowned of the plums cultivated.\r\nA proof of its popularity is the great number of names, as shown in\r\nthe synonymy given above, under which it passes in England and on\r\nthe continent. This variety, however, is almost unknown in America\r\nthough described by all of the older American pomologists and probably\r\nintroduced time and again during the last hundred years in our orchards.\r\nThe French fruit books say that the variety thrives better in southern\r\nthan northern France and nearly all of the European writers state that\r\nit does best in high, dry, light, warm soils. It is likely that our\r\nclimate, and the soils in which plums are generally grown in America, are\r\nnot suited to this sort. Unfortunately this Station has no trees of this\r\nvariety and the brief description given is a compilation.\r\n\r\nThe Orleans has been cultivated for more than two hundred years. Langley\r\nsaid of it in 1729 “The Orleans Plumb tho a common, is yet a very\r\nvaluable Plumb, as well for its fine firm juicy Pulp when well ripened,\r\nas its being a constant and plentiful bearer.” The Red Damask and the\r\nBrugnole mentioned by Quintinye in 1699 are probably the Orleans; but\r\nthe Prune de Monsieur of Knoop and the Monsieur of Tournefort, which are\r\nyellow, are distinct. The variety is evidently of French origin. Mas\r\nin his _Pomologie Generale_, 1873, states that it first bore the name\r\nBrignole Violette, but later was given the name it now bears in honor of\r\nMonsieur, Duke of Orleans, brother of Louis XIV. Damas Rouge is an old\r\nsynonym, though Duhamel described it as a distinct variety. Herrnpflaume\r\nis the common name of the Orleans in Germany and Austria, while in\r\nFrance, it is often called the Monsieur. It has never been common in\r\nAmerica, yet it was entered on the American Pomological Society catalog\r\nlist in 1875.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, hardy, productive, bearing annually;\r\n    branches grayish, pubescent; leaves large, ovate, with crenate\r\n    margins; flowers large, blooming early; petals roundish,\r\n    imbricated.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season; medium in size, roundish-truncate,\r\n    sides unequal; cavity usually shallow, wide; suture distinct;\r\n    apex flattened; color dark or purplish-red, overspread with\r\n    thin bloom, with a sprinkling of pale reddish dots; stem thick,\r\n    short; skin tender; flesh yellowish, juicy, usually melting\r\n    when properly matured, sweet near the skin but sprightly toward\r\n    the center, pleasant-flavored; good; stone free, small, oval,\r\n    flattened, with roughish surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nOULLINS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OULLINS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 374. 1866. =2.= Downing _Fr.

The fault is in the\r\nfruit which is but indifferent in quality for a plum of the Reine Claude\r\ngroup. In Europe the variety is rated as one of the best dessert sorts;\r\nin America it is hardly second-rate in quality. This difference may be\r\ndue to differences in climate and soil; more probably, it is due to the\r\ngreater number of better Reine Claude varieties grown in America with\r\nwhich it must compete. Hand, Jefferson, Washington, McLaughlin, Yellow\r\nGage, Spaulding and Imperial Gage, the cream of the Reine Claude plums,\r\nare all Americans similar to Oullins but much better in quality. Oullins\r\nis hardly surpassed by any of its group in tree-characters and might well\r\nbe used for breeding purposes as there are so few sorts of its kind\r\nhaving satisfactory trees.\r\n\r\nThis variety, probably a Reine Claude seedling, was found at Coligny,\r\nFrance, on the estate of M. Filliaud; it was propagated by M.\r\nCorsaint, gardener to the Baron de Toisy, near Cuiseaux (Department of\r\nSaone-et-Loire) and was introduced at Oullins (Department of Rhone) by\r\nM. Massot, nurseryman. The name is seldom spelled correctly in American\r\nfruit books, being either written with an apostrophe and s or with both\r\nleft off, these spellings coming from the supposition that the name comes\r\nfrom that of a man, a mistake as the history shows. Oullins was placed\r\non the American Pomological Society catalog fruit list in 1875 but was\r\ndropped when the catalog was revised in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, somewhat rough, with numerous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels; branchlets stout, the bark rough,\r\n    medium to above in thickness, short, with short internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to brownish-red, dull, lightly pubescent,\r\n    overspread with faint bloom, with numerous, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds large, long, pointed, free; leaf-scars swollen.\r\n\r\n    Leaves oval or obovate, two inches wide, four and one-quarter\r\n    inches long, thick; upper surface dark green, covered with fine\r\n    hairs, the midrib grooved; lower surface pale green, pubescent;\r\n    apex acute or abruptly pointed, base acute, margin serrate\r\n    or crenate, with small black glands; petiole three-quarters\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, tinged red, with from two to four\r\n    globose, greenish-brown glands variable in size, usually on the\r\n    stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-quarter inches across,\r\n    white, with a faint yellowish tinge; arranged on lateral spurs,\r\n    singly or in pairs; pedicels eleven-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent;\r\n    calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals broadly obovate, crenate,\r\n    tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens\r\n    in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; medium to below in size, roundish,\r\n    halves equal; cavity shallow, below medium in width, abrupt;\r\n    suture an indistinct line; apex flattened or depressed; color\r\n    greenish-yellow changing to dull light yellow, overspread with\r\n    thin bloom; dots numerous, small, whitish, inconspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the apex; stem of medium thickness and length,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, slightly astringent,\r\n    separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow or pale yellow,\r\n    somewhat dry, firm, sweet, not high in flavor; good; stone\r\n    half-free or free, three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, broadly oval, flattened, roughened and pitted, blunt at\r\n    the base and apex; ventral suture rather narrow, furrowed, with\r\n    a distinct but not prominent wing; dorsal suture broadly and\r\n    deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACIFIC]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

Willamette\r\n    Prune 3.\r\n\r\nNo part of America is so well adapted to plum culture as the Pacific\r\nCoast and especially the inter-mountain valleys in Oregon. From the\r\nlast-named State, though fruit-growing is a very recent development, a\r\nnumber of meritorious plums have been added to pomology. One of the best\r\nof these, as they grow in New York, is the Pacific, the fruits of which\r\nare well shown in the color-plate. Few purple plums are more beautiful\r\nthan this in color and shape, few equal it in size and very few of its\r\ncolor excel it in quality. The trees are unusually robust, perfectly\r\nhardy and productive. In Oregon the Pacific has not proved a good\r\nprune-making plum but is reported as standing eastern shipment very well,\r\nwhich, if true, indicates that this plum would succeed as a market fruit\r\nin New York. Pacific is well worth trying in New York as a commercial\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThis plum is hopelessly confused with the Willamette. The following is\r\nan abridged account of the two fruits as written us by H. M. Williamson,\r\nSecretary of the Oregon State Board of Horticulture, and one of the\r\nleading authorities on fruit-growing on the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\n    “About 1875 Jesse Bullock of Oswego, Oregon, sent to Germany\r\n    for pits of the Italian or Fellenberg prune, and planted the\r\n    pits received in a nursery row. When the trees from these\r\n    began to bear, Mr. C. E. Hoskins went to Mr. Bullock’s place,\r\n    examined the fruit and selected trees which seemed promising,\r\n    giving to each tree a number. From at least six of these trees\r\n    he took scions, propagated them, and named them Bullock No. 1,\r\n    Bullock No. 2, etc. He finally decided that only two of these,\r\n    Bullock No. 1 and Bullock No. 6, were of sufficient value to\r\n    justify their further propagation. Bullock No. 1 was named\r\n    Champion and Bullock No. 6, Willamette. Mr. Hoskins told me\r\n    these names were given by the State Horticultural Society, but\r\n    I find no record of this action. He propagated and sold a good\r\n    many trees of both varieties, but more of the Willamette than\r\n    of the Champion.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Hoskins was strongly of the opinion that the Pacific is\r\n    identical with the Willamette. I am as strongly of the opinion\r\n    that they are distinct varieties. I base my opinion, first,\r\n    upon the history of the origin of the Pacific given me by Henry\r\n    Freeboro, Portland, Oregon, who introduced it; and, second,\r\n    upon what appear to me to be marked differences in the two\r\n    prunes. A number of years ago I went to Mr. Freeboro’s place\r\n    when prunes were ripe and obtained from him a supply of Pacific\r\n    prunes grown on trees propagated by him from scions taken from\r\n    the original Pacific tree. I took these prunes to Springbrook\r\n    and compared them with the Willamette grown on Mr. Hoskins’\r\n    place. I was thoroughly convinced that the two were decidedly\r\n    different in character, but Mr. Hoskins did not think so. I\r\n    noticed first a marked difference in the habits of growth of\r\n    the trees. The Pacific trees were of unusually vigorous growth\r\n    and had a decided upright tendency. The Willamette trees\r\n    were very similar to the Italian in vigor and had the rather\r\n    spreading habit of growth of the Italian. The Pacific prunes\r\n    are larger in size than the Willamette and vary much more in\r\n    size. One of the most decided indications of difference is\r\n    the far greater tendency to brown-rot of the fruit of the\r\n    Pacific than is the case with the fruit of the Willamette.\r\n    This has been observed when scions of the Willamette and of\r\n    the Pacific have been grafted on the same tree for the purpose\r\n    of comparison. I have never seen a well dried specimen of the\r\n    Pacific, but this may have been the fault of the men who dried\r\n    the specimens I have seen. The Willamette dries easily for a\r\n    prune of its size and gives a larger percentage of dried to\r\n    fresh fruit than the Italian, according to Mr. Hoskins.\r\n\r\n    “I believe the Willamette is well worthy of more attention in\r\n    the Willamette Valley, whereas the Pacific, on account of its\r\n    extreme susceptibility to the brown-rot, does not appear to be\r\n    a safe variety here, although when perfect it is a magnificent\r\n    prune for eating fresh, and one of the very largest known. I am\r\n    told that in eastern Oregon where climatic conditions keep out\r\n    the brown-rot, the Pacific is proving one of the best varieties\r\n    for shipping fresh. At the present time the two varieties are\r\n    much confused. When the Pacific prune was introduced, Mr.\r\n    Hoskins and other recognized authorities, pronounced it the\r\n    Willamette, and nurserymen therefore obtained scions from\r\n    Willamette trees and sold the propagated trees as Pacifies, and\r\n    in a more limited way the reverse was done. The greater part of\r\n    the trees supposed to be Pacifics are in fact Willamettes.”\r\n\r\nAt this Station we have the two plums under discussion, the Pacific\r\nhaving been obtained from Fred E. Young, nurseryman, Rochester, New York,\r\nand the Willamette, under the name Pacific, from the Oregon Wholesale\r\nNursery Company, Salem, Oregon. The differences between the two plums in\r\nNew York are essentially those given by Mr. Williamson as distinguishing\r\ncharacters in Oregon.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with small, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets above medium in thickness, short, with\r\n    short internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-red,\r\n    covered with heavy bloom and sparingly pubescent, with\r\n    indistinct small lenticels; leaf-buds plump, of medium size and\r\n    length, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves obovate, two inches wide, four inches long, the oldest\r\n    thick and leathery; upper surface dark green, covered with fine\r\n    hairs, with a widely and deeply grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    pale green, pubescent; apex acute or obtuse, base acute, margin\r\n    crenate, with small dark glands; petiole seven-eighths inch\r\n    long, thick, pubescent, tinged red, with from two to four\r\n    large, globose, yellowish-green glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season of medium length; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one and three-sixteenths inches across, white;\r\n    borne on lateral spurs and buds, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long, thick, pubescent; calyx-tube\r\n    green, campanulate, pubescent only at the base; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, lightly pubescent on both surfaces but heavily\r\n    pubescent along the serrate margin, reflexed; petals oval,\r\n    dentate, tapering to short, broad claws; stamens inclined to\r\n    develop into rudimentary petals; anthers yellow; filaments\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    two inches by one and five-eighths inches in size, ovate,\r\n    halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring; suture shallow,\r\n    indistinct; apex bluntly pointed; color bluish, overspread with\r\n    thick bloom; dots small, brown, conspicuous, clustered about\r\n    the apex; stem thick, one-half inch long, pubescent, adhering\r\n    well to the fruit; skin thin, tough, separating readily;\r\n    flesh pale golden-yellow, juicy, firm, sweet, spicy; good;\r\n    stone free, one inch by five-eighths inch in size, flattened,\r\n    irregularly broad-oval, obliquely contracted at the base, blunt\r\n    at the apex, with rough and pitted surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    narrow, with numerous deep furrows, usually blunt; dorsal\r\n    suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALATINE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\nThis plum, scarcely known outside of two counties in New York, is of\r\ndistinctly good quality and if all accounts are true is fairly immune to\r\nblack-knot. In size and appearance the fruits are superior to many other\r\nReine Claude plums, with which it must be compared, so much so that the\r\nvariety is probably worth growing outside the region where the following\r\ninteresting history shows it has been cultivated for nearly a century and\r\na half.\r\n\r\nPalatine, according to Mr. Washington Garlock of New York, originated in\r\n1760 when a family of Palatines by the name of Best came from Germany\r\nto the United States and settled in Livingston Manor (East Camps) now\r\nColumbia County, New York. They brought with them plum pits which they\r\nplanted and from them secured one tree. In 1762 they moved to Schoharie\r\nCounty, New York, taking with them the seedling tree. In their new home\r\nthey propagated the variety, which they named Palatine, and disseminated\r\nit so industriously that it became thoroughly established throughout\r\nMontgomery and Schoharie counties and attained great popularity because\r\nof its apparent freedom from black-knot. That this popularity is merited\r\nis attested by the fact that after one hundred and fifty years it is\r\nstill extensively grown in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, productive;\r\n    branches thick; branchlets lightly pubescent; leaves flattened,\r\n    slightly drooping, obovate, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    three and one-quarter inches long, thick, rugose; margin\r\n    coarsely crenate, eglandular or with few, small glands; petiole\r\n    pubescent, glandless or with one or two small glands; blooming\r\n    season intermediate in time, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, more than one inch across, white with yellow tinge\r\n    at the apex of the petals; borne singly; calyx-lobes thickly\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, strongly reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; about\r\n    one and one-half inches in diameter, roundish or roundish-oval,\r\n    dull yellowish-green becoming greenish-yellow at full maturity,\r\n    mottled and indistinctly blushed on the sunny side, overspread\r\n    with thin bloom; skin thin, slightly sour; flesh light\r\n    golden-yellow, juicy, fibrous, firm, sweet, pleasant in flavor;\r\n    good to very good; stone dark colored, free or nearly so,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, oval, with thickly\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture blunt or with a short, narrow\r\n    wing; dorsal suture wide, shallow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUL EARLY\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

It is so similar to Early Rivers,\r\na variety of small account in America, as to be an almost worthless\r\naddition to the list of plums. Paul Early originated with and was sent\r\nout by J. M. Paul, North Adams, Massachusetts, about 1888.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, round-topped, dense, very\r\n    productive; branches covered with numerous fruit-spurs;\r\n    branchlets twiggy, thickly pubescent; leaf-buds strongly\r\n    appressed; leaves flattened, obovate or oval, two and\r\n    three-eighths inches wide, four inches long; margin crenate,\r\n    with few, small, dark glands; petiole reddish, pubescent,\r\n    glandless or with one or two large glands; blooming season\r\n    intermediate in time, short; flowers appearing before the\r\n    leaves, one inch across; borne in scattering clusters, usually\r\n    in pairs; pedicels very thick and pubescent; anthers tinged red.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and three-eighths inches\r\n    by one and one-quarter inches in size, roundish-oval, dark\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; skin tender,\r\n    slightly sour; flesh greenish-yellow becoming yellowish,\r\n    tender, sweet near the surface but sour next the pit, mild;\r\n    good; stone clinging, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, irregular-oval, with roughened and thickly pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture prominent, seldom winged; dorsal\r\n    suture with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _N.

Unfortunately this variety is capricious beyond most other\r\nplums as to climate and soils and refuses to thrive unless its needs are\r\nvery well supplied in the matter of environment. In America it seems to\r\nfind congenial soil and climate only on the Pacific Coast, and even then\r\nrefuses to bear well except on strong, rich soils. In New York, even when\r\ngrown upon soils similar to those upon which it does well elsewhere,\r\nthe fruits are few and lacking in quality, though the trees are large,\r\nvigorous and about all that could be desired in a good plum tree. It may\r\nbe possible to grow Peach in favorable locations in the East; in which\r\ncase, a plum of its appearance and quality, coming as early in the season\r\nas it ripens, would make a most desirable addition to the list of plums.\r\nFrom its behavior elsewhere the situation that would suit it best in New\r\nYork is a sunny exposure with a warm, rich, clay loam.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Peach is unknown. Poiteau was unable to find any\r\nreference to it in the Eighteenth Century European literature and\r\nthought, therefore, that it must have been unknown to this period. Samuel\r\nDeane mentions a Peach plum in New England in 1797. It is doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether it is the Peach of this discussion, the name having been\r\napplied indiscriminately to several varieties, the Goliath, Nectarine\r\nand Apricot in particular. Prince, in 1832, described a Large Peach Plum\r\nwhich he said “had been introduced a few years since” but as his variety\r\nis oval and a clingstone, it is not the same as the Peach of Poiteau, the\r\none discussed here, this plum being nearly round and a freestone. Judge\r\nJames C. Duane of Schenectady, New York, seems to have first imported\r\nthe Peach plum, with several others, from France, in 1820. The name of\r\nthis variety was lost during the shipment and as the invoice called\r\nfor an Apricot Plum, the names Apricot and Duane’s Plum became locally\r\napplied to what afterwards turned out to be the Peach. C. H. Tomlinson\r\nof Schenectady and A. J. Downing in 1846 made a careful study of these\r\nimported plums and showed conclusively that this Apricot or Duane’s Plum\r\nwas the Peach of the French. In 1862, the American Pomological Society\r\nadded Peach to the fruit catalog list and recommended it for the eastern\r\nand western sections of New York.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, very vigorous, spreading, round or flat-topped,\r\n    hardy, medium in productiveness; branches stocky, smooth, dark\r\n    ash-brown, with lenticels of medium number and size; branchlets\r\n    thick, with internodes one inch long, light brown, covered with\r\n    short, heavy pubescence; leaf-buds large, of medium length,\r\n    conical.\r\n\r\n    Leaves large, oval, of average thickness; upper surface dark\r\n    green; lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex obtuse, margin\r\n    doubly crenate, with small glands; petiole three-quarters inch\r\n    long, thick, pubescent, with a trace of red, usually with two,\r\n    small, globose, greenish glands at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early; thick-set, without a neck, one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches in diameter, roundish, slightly angular, halves equal;\r\n    cavity deep, wide, compressed; suture shallow, distinct; apex\r\n    flattened or depressed; color dark purplish-red, overspread\r\n    with thin bloom; dots numerous, large, conspicuous; stem\r\n    eleven-sixteenths inch long, glabrous, adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin tough, adhering; flesh golden-yellow, medium\r\n    juicy, firm, subacid, mild; good; stone free, one inch by\r\n    three-quarters inch in size, roundish-oval, flattened, with\r\n    rough and pitted surfaces, blunt at the base and apex; ventral\r\n    suture wide, prominent, often distinctly winged; dorsal suture\r\n    with a wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEARL]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 5. 1898. =2.= _Am. Gard._ =21=:36. 1900.\r\n    =3.= _Waugh Plum Cult._ 118. 1901.\r\n\r\nOne can grow seedlings of some plums with considerable certainty of\r\ngetting respectable offspring—plums worth having in an orchard—but the\r\nchances of growing a variety of superior qualities are small indeed.\r\nIt is a piece of good luck, a matter almost wholly of luck, when, as in\r\nthis case, but one parent is known, to secure as fine a fruit as the\r\nPearl plum. The variety now under notice is one to be pleased with if it\r\ncame as a chance out of thousands; its rich, golden color, large size,\r\nfine form, melting flesh and sweet, luscious flavor, place it among the\r\nbest dessert plums. In the mind of the writer and of those who have\r\nassisted in describing the varieties for _The Plums of New York_, it is\r\nunsurpassed in quality by any other plum. The tree-characters, however,\r\ndo not correspond in desirability with those of the fruits. The trees,\r\nwhile of medium size and seemingly as vigorous and healthy as any, are\r\nunproductive. In none of the several years they have been fruiting at\r\nthis Station have they borne a large crop. If elsewhere this defect does\r\nnot show, the variety becomes at once one of great value. The fruits\r\nof Pearl are said to cure into delicious prunes—to be readily believed\r\nby one who has eaten the fresh fruits. This variety ought to be very\r\ngenerally tried by commercial plum-growers and is recommended to all who\r\ngrow fruit for pleasure.\r\n\r\nPearl is a recent addition to the list of plums and though its history is\r\nwell known its parentage is in doubt. In 1898, Luther Burbank introduced\r\nthe variety as a new prune grown from the seed of the well-known\r\nAgen. The male parent is not known but from the fruit and tree, one\r\nat once surmises that it was some variety of the Reine Claude group,\r\nits characters being so like those of the plum named that no one could\r\nsuspect that it came from the seed of a plum so far removed from the\r\nReine Claude as the Agen.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, vasiform, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    unproductive; branches ash-gray, with numerous, small,\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets twiggy, thick, long, with long\r\n    internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-red, very\r\n    pubescent early in the season becoming less so at maturity,\r\n    with numerous, small, raised lenticels; leaf-buds large, above\r\n    medium in length, conical, appressed; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves broadly oval, one and seven-eighths inches wide, three\r\n    and one-half inches long, thick, leathery; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose, covered with fine hairs, with a grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed,\r\n    base abrupt, margin serrate or crenate, with small, black\r\n    glands; petiole seven-eighths inch long, thick, pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    brownish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, showy on account of their size,\r\n    averaging one and five-eighths inches across, white, with a\r\n    tinge of yellow at the apex of the petals; borne on lateral\r\n    spurs and buds, usually singly; pedicels one-half inch long,\r\n    thick, strongly pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs,\r\n    strongly reflexed; petals obovate or oblong, entire, tapering\r\n    to short, broad claws; anthers yellow; filaments nearly\r\n    one-half inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    one and three-quarters inches by one and one-half inches\r\n    in size, roundish-oval, compressed, halves unequal; cavity\r\n    shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture a line; apex depressed; color\r\n    golden-yellow, obscurely striped and splashed with dull green,\r\n    mottled, overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    whitish, inconspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem thick,\r\n    three-quarters inch long, thickly pubescent, adhering well to\r\n    the fruit; skin tough, separating readily; flesh deep yellow,\r\n    juicy, a little coarse and fibrous, firm but tender, very\r\n    sweet, with a pleasant, mild flavor, aromatic; very good to\r\n    best; stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    long-oval, slightly necked at the base, bluntly acute at the\r\n    apex, with rough surfaces; ventral suture broad, blunt; dorsal\r\n    suture with a wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETERS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETERS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Pom.

This variety,\r\nhowever, is not equal in appearance to any one of several other sorts in\r\nits group, lacking size and color. The trees are large, hardy, robust\r\nand healthy, surpassing in these respects most of the other Reine Claude\r\nsorts. The tree-characters have made this variety a prime favorite in\r\nwestern New York for two generations, one pomologist after another\r\nrecommending it for this section. The fruits are not sufficiently\r\nattractive to sell well, however, and the variety is now going out of\r\ncultivation except for the amateur. While a very good plum it does\r\nnot appear to be worth growing in competition with Hand, Washington,\r\nMcLaughlin, Jefferson, Spaulding and the latest comer among these\r\nhigh-quality plums, Pearl.\r\n\r\nOf the origin of this old plum we have no certain information. William\r\nPrince, the first pomologist to mention it, gave a brief description\r\nof the variety in his “A Short Treatise on Horticulture” published in\r\n1828 but says nothing in regard to its history. In 1831 the London\r\nHorticultural Society listed it in its fruit catalog but otherwise the\r\nvariety is not mentioned in the European pomologies.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large, vigorous, round and dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches thick, ash-gray, smooth except for the\r\n    numerous, rather large, raised lenticels; branchlets thick,\r\n    short, with short internodes, greenish-red changing to dark\r\n    brownish-drab, dull, pubescent throughout the season, with\r\n    numerous, inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds medium in\r\n    size and length, pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, obovate or oval, two inches wide, four\r\n    inches long; upper surface covered with numerous hairs, with\r\n    a shallow groove on the midrib; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    heavily pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base rather\r\n    abrupt, margin slightly crenate, eglandular or with few, small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, thick, tinged\r\n    red, pubescent, glandless or with one or two small, globose or\r\n    reniform, greenish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, one and one-eighth inches wide,\r\n    white, creamy at the apex; borne on lateral spurs or buds,\r\n    singly or in pairs; pedicels about one inch long, below\r\n    medium in thickness, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    obconic, pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent on\r\n    both surfaces, glandular-serrate and with fine marginal hairs,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-oval or obovate, dentate to slightly\r\n    crenate; anthers yellow, with a slight trace of red; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season rather short; about one and one-half inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish, compressed, halves equal; cavity very\r\n    shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow; apex flattened or\r\n    depressed; color dull yellowish-green, often blushed or mottled\r\n    on the sunny side, covered with thick bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    large, whitish, conspicuous; stem one and one-eighth inches\r\n    long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tough,\r\n    separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, somewhat\r\n    fibrous, firm but tender, sweet next the skin but sour near the\r\n    center, with pleasant flavor; very good; stone clinging, one\r\n    inch by three-quarters inch in size, oval, turgid, somewhat\r\n    acute at the base and apex, with pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture wide, indistinctly furrowed, often with a short wing;\r\n    dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOND\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POND]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

Semis de Pond 17.\r\n\r\nPond is preeminent among plums for its large size. It is distinguished\r\nalso by its form and its color, both being pleasing as well as\r\ndistinctive. The three characters, size, form and color make this one\r\nof the handsomest of all plums. Despite the efforts of the color-plate\r\nmakers, the peculiar red of this plum is not well shown in the\r\nillustration—to the disparagement of the fruit. At one time Pond was very\r\nlargely grown in New York but the fruits are not as perfect, grown here,\r\nas on the Pacific Coast and the trees are not regular in bearing. The\r\neye is pleased with Pond but the palate is sadly disappointed; at best\r\nit is not even second-rate. The fruits, however, ship and keep well, as\r\nis demonstrated by the large quantities of this variety annually sent\r\nfrom California to the East for sale on fruit-stands where its showiness\r\nperennially beguiles the uninformed fruit-buyer. There is a fine\r\nopportunity for some one to cross this splendid-appearing plum with one\r\nof good quality in the hope of getting an offspring as handsome but of\r\nbetter quality.\r\n\r\nThis variety was obtained from seed by Mr. Pond, an English amateur\r\ngrower of fruits, concerning whom there seems to be no further\r\ninformation. The London Horticultural Society mentioned the variety as\r\nlong ago as in 1831. Another Mr. Pond, a nurseryman in Massachusetts,\r\ngrew a variety very similar in appearance to the English plum and\r\npermitted his name to be given it to the great confusion of the\r\nnomenclature of the two. The Hungarian prune of the Pacific Coast is\r\nPond, why so-called does not appear; with this as with several other\r\nplums the Pacific Coast fruit-growers persist in using a name known to\r\nhave been wrongly applied to an old and well-known variety elsewhere\r\ncalled rightly. Oswego, a supposed seedling grown in Oswego, New York,\r\nis identical with the Pond as tested by this Experiment Station and by\r\nlocal growers. The American Pomological Society placed this fruit on its\r\ncatalog list in 1856.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright, hardy, variable in\r\n    productiveness; branches light gray, smooth, with small,\r\n    raised lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness and length,\r\n    with internodes of average length, greenish-red changing to\r\n    brownish-drab, dull, sparingly pubescent, with inconspicuous\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, conical, free;\r\n    leaf-scars plump, often much enlarged at the apex of the twigs.\r\n\r\n    Leaves somewhat folded backward, oval, two and one-quarter\r\n    inches wide, four inches long, thick, leathery; upper surface\r\n    dark green, finely pubescent, rugose, with a grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed\r\n    or acute, base abrupt, margin crenate or serrate, with small\r\n    dark glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, thick, pubescent,\r\n    tinged red, with one or two globose, yellowish glands variable\r\n    in size, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and five-sixteenths inches\r\n    across, white; borne in thin clusters on lateral spurs and\r\n    buds, singly or in pairs; pedicels thirteen-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, lightly pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, margins with few glands and hairs, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish, crenate, tapering to short, broad claws; filaments\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to or\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; two inches by one and three-quarters\r\n    inches in size, obovate or oval, frequently with a slight\r\n    neck, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture\r\n    very shallow, often a line; apex roundish; color varies from\r\n    reddish-purple to purplish-red, overspread with thick bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, small, reddish-brown, obscure, larger in size\r\n    but fewer in number towards the base; stem thick, seven-eighths\r\n    inch long, heavily pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin\r\n    tough, separating readily; flesh attractive golden-yellow, not\r\n    very juicy, fibrous, firm, of average sweetness, mild, not\r\n    highly flavored; fair in quality; stone semi-free to free, one\r\n    and one-sixteenths inches by nine-sixteenths inch in size,\r\n    long-oval, flattened, the surfaces roughened and deeply pitted,\r\n    tapering towards the base and apex; ventral suture heavily\r\n    furrowed, with a distinct but not prominent wing; dorsal suture\r\n    usually widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOLE PRIDE\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Poole’s Pride 3,\r\n    4, 5. _Poole’s Pride_ 2, 6, 7.\r\n\r\nAs compared with other native plums growing on the grounds at this\r\nStation, Poole Pride has considerable merit. It is very attractive in\r\nappearance, it seems to have all the characters of a long-keeping and\r\na good-shipping sort of its species and the trees are large, vigorous,\r\nhardy, healthy and productive. It is, however, lacking in the very\r\nimportant character of flavor though the texture of the flesh is all that\r\ncould be desired. Its very peculiar flavor, incomparable with any other\r\nplum or fruit, while disagreeable to the writer, might be liked by some.\r\nThe flesh of this plum is so transparent that the pit can be readily seen\r\nwhen the skin is removed. To those growing native plums, Poole Pride is\r\nrecommended for trial.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised by P. H. Kroh, Anna, Illinois, and was exhibited\r\nby him under the name Kroh at the American Pomological Society meeting in\r\n1885. Three years later the same plum was introduced by Stark Brothers,\r\nLouisiana, Missouri, under the name of Poole’s Pride. The latter name has\r\nbeen so much more widely used that it has been retained even though the\r\nformer is correct according to the rule of priority.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, open and round-topped, hardy, productive,\r\n    healthy; branches rough, zigzag, with few thorns, dark\r\n    ash-gray, with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets twiggy,\r\n    slender, above medium in length, with short internodes,\r\n    greenish-red changing to light chestnut-red, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous, very conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    small, short, obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, ovate or obovate, peach-like, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches wide, three and one-half inches long,\r\n    thin and leathery; upper surface dull red late in the season,\r\n    smooth, glossy, with a narrow groove on the midrib; lower\r\n    surface lightly pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base rather\r\n    abrupt, margin finely crenate, with small dark glands; petiole\r\n    seven-eighths inch long, slender, hairy, light purplish-red,\r\n    with from one to four small, globose, reddish-brown glands on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, five-eighths inch across, white; borne in clusters on\r\n    short lateral spurs and buds; pedicels nine-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, very slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube greenish,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, heavily\r\n    pubescent within and along the margin which is serrate and\r\n    covered with reddish glands, erect; petals small, ovate\r\n    or roundish, crenate, tapering into long pubescent claws;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season very long; one inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish-oval, not compressed, halves equal; cavity very\r\n    shallow and narrow; suture a distinct line; apex roundish;\r\n    color clear, dark, currant-red, with thin bloom; dots few,\r\n    large, light russet, conspicuous, clustered about the apex;\r\n    stem slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous, but overspread\r\n    with a grayish bloom, adhering to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tough, separating from the pulp; flesh semi-transparent, dark\r\n    amber-yellow, very juicy, fibrous, tender and melting, sweet,\r\n    with a strong, peculiar flavor not pleasant; of fair quality;\r\n    stone adhering, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in\r\n    size, long-oval, slightly flattened, compressed at the base,\r\n    pointed at the apex, roughish; ventral suture blunt, faintly\r\n    ridged; dorsal suture acute, entire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTAWATTAMIE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTTAWATTAMIE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It is of high\r\nquality for a native plum, the texture of the fruit being especially\r\npleasing in eating, and though melting and juicy it keeps and ships\r\nvery well because of a tough skin. It escapes both the curculio and the\r\nbrown-rot to a higher degree than most of its kind. The trees, though\r\ndwarfish at maturity, are vigorous, productive and among the hardiest\r\nof the Munsoniana plums, growing without danger of winter injury to\r\ntree or bud as far north as the forty-fourth parallel. Pottawattamie is\r\ndeservedly one of the best known of the native plums and if varieties of\r\nits species are to be grown in New York, is as desirable as any.\r\n\r\nPottawattamie, according to the most authoritative accounts, was taken\r\nfrom Tennessee to Iowa with a lot of Miner trees. It came under the\r\nnotice of J. B. Rice, Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1875, and was introduced\r\nby him and named after one of the counties of his State.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium in size, strong and vigorous when young becoming\r\n    spreading and somewhat dwarfish when older, round-topped, hardy\r\n    at Geneva, usually productive; branches dark brown, zigzag,\r\n    thorny, roughened by the numerous, raised lenticels of various\r\n    sizes which are often narrow and much elongated; branchlets\r\n    slender, long, with internodes of medium length, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dark chestnut-red, glabrous, with numerous,\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flat or folded upward, lanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    one-eighth inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface light green, reddish late in the season,\r\n    smooth, glossy, with a grooved midrib; lower surface pale\r\n    green, lightly pubescent along the midrib and larger veins;\r\n    apex taper-pointed, base abrupt, margin finely serrate or\r\n    crenate, with small, reddish glands; petiole one inch long,\r\n    slender, tinged red, thinly pubescent, glandless or with from\r\n    one to five very small, globose, reddish-yellow glands usually\r\n    on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, five-eighths inch across, creamy-white as the buds\r\n    unfold changing to whitish, with a disagreeable odor; borne\r\n    in clusters from lateral buds, in threes, fours or fives;\r\n    pedicels five-eighths inch long, very slender, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, broadly obconic, glabrous,\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, somewhat acute, pubescent on the inner\r\n    surface, serrate, with reddish glands and hairy margin, erect;\r\n    petals small, oval, slightly toothed, narrowly clawed; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season of medium length; variable in size ranging\r\n    from seven-eighths inch to one and one-eighth inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish-oval, slightly compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity very shallow and narrow, abrupt; suture indistinct;\r\n    apex roundish or depressed; color clear currant-red, with\r\n    thin bloom; dots few, medium to large, whitish, somewhat\r\n    conspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem very slender,\r\n    three-quarters inch long, glabrous, adhering poorly to the\r\n    fruit; skin tough, cracking under unfavorable conditions,\r\n    separating readily; flesh deep yellow, juicy, fibrous, tender\r\n    and melting, sweet next the skin but sour at the center, of\r\n    pleasant flavor; fair to good in quality; stone clinging\r\n    closely, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size,\r\n    narrow, long-oval, turgid, smooth, flattened and necked at the\r\n    base, abruptly sharp-tipped at the apex; ventral suture acute,\r\n    inconspicuous; dorsal suture blunt, faintly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE GAGE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Pom.

In all but color of fruit it is a true Gage, to say which\r\nis a sufficient characterization as to quality. In size it averages\r\nlarger than most of the Gages or Reine Claude plums, and in color is a\r\nrich dark purple as attractive as any of the purple plums. Another good\r\nquality of the fruit is that of hanging to the tree until it shrivels\r\nat which time it is richest in flavor. Unfortunately the trees, while\r\naveraging very well in other respects, are not productive and the variety\r\ncannot be recommended for money-making though it well deserves a place in\r\nhome orchards.\r\n\r\nPurple Gage is a European variety of unknown origin, though in the\r\n_Catalogue descriptif des fruits adoptes par le Congres pomologique_ for\r\n1887, it is said to have been raised by M. Galopin of Liege, Belgium.\r\nAs it was not mentioned by Duhamel in his _Traite des Arbres Fruitiers_\r\nin 1768, it is thought to have been unknown at that date. English and\r\nAmerican authors generally apply the name Purple Gage to this variety but\r\nin continental countries the name Reine Claude Violette is most common.\r\nIt was imported into America early in the last century and in 1852 was\r\nadded to the recommended list of fruits in the American Pomological\r\nSociety catalog.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, hardy, not very productive;\r\n    branches numerous, light ash-gray, with few, small, raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, above medium in length, with\r\n    rather short internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-red,\r\n    marked with much scarf-skin, glabrous throughout the season,\r\n    with few, small, slightly-raised lenticels; leaf-buds of\r\n    medium size and length, conical, appressed; leaf-scars greatly\r\n    enlarged.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and three-quarters inches\r\n    wide, three and one-half inches long, thick, stiff; upper\r\n    surface dark green, distinctly rugose, lightly pubescent, with\r\n    a shallow groove on the midrib; lower surface silvery-green,\r\n    covered with thick pubescence; apex abruptly pointed or acute,\r\n    base rather abrupt, margin serrate or crenate, eglandular or\r\n    with small dark glands; petiole three-quarters inch long,\r\n    thick, greenish, pubescent, glandless or with one or two rather\r\n    large, globose, yellowish-green glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late, of medium length; flowers appearing with\r\n    the leaves, nearly one and one-quarter inches across, white;\r\n    borne from lateral buds, usually singly; pedicels five-eighths\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, lightly\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed;\r\n    petals obovate or oval, crenate, short-clawed; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments nearly one-half inch long; pistil glabrous except at\r\n    the base, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; one\r\n    and one-half inches by one and three-eighths inches in size,\r\n    roundish or ovate, slightly compressed, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, narrow, abrupt; suture very shallow, often a line;\r\n    apex variable in shape; color dark purple or purplish-black,\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, russet, conspicuous\r\n    when the bloom is removed, clustered about the apex; stem\r\n    five-eighths inch long, thinly pubescent, adhering well to\r\n    the fruit; skin thin, separating readily; flesh dull yellow,\r\n    juicy, somewhat fibrous, firm but tender, sweet, of pleasant\r\n    flavor; very good; stone semi-clinging, seven-eighths inch\r\n    by five-eighths inch in size, irregular-oval, flat, often\r\n    contracted at the base into a long narrow neck, blunt at\r\n    the apex, with markedly rough and pitted surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture swollen, rather wide, distinctly furrowed, often with a\r\n    prominent wing; dorsal suture with a wide and deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUACKENBOSS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUACKENBOSS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Its fruits possess to a high\r\ndegree the characters which make a good market plum; they are of large\r\nsize, averaging nearly an inch and a half in diameter; round-oval, a\r\nbetter shape for the markets than the prune shapes; very prepossessing\r\nin color—a handsome, dark purple with heavy bloom; the flesh is tender\r\nand juicy with a sweet, pleasant flavor making it one of the good\r\npurple plums, though not one of the best in quality. The tree is large,\r\nvigorous, hardy, with a round and spreading top. This gives it great\r\nbearing capacity but though productive in the Station orchard, the\r\nvariety does not have the reputation of being fruitful and fails chiefly\r\nas a commercial sort for this reason. It is a late-maturing variety and\r\ncomes on the market at a time when plums are wanted for home canning, the\r\ndemand for this purpose, for which it is most suitable, helping greatly\r\nits sale. The variety has two peculiarities; the petals are comparatively\r\ndistinct from each other giving the flower, or a tree in flower, an odd\r\nappearance; and the leaves are remarkably variable in size.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite certain when or where this variety first came to\r\nnotice. C. Reagles, a competent authority, of Schenectady, New York, in\r\ndescribing the Quackenboss for _The Cultivator_ in 1858, says “There\r\nis a seedling tree of this identical sort in the garden of Mr. S. C.\r\nGroot of this city, which is about thirty years old.” If true, this\r\nputs its origin in Schenectady at about 1828. But beyond question a Mr.\r\nQuackenboss of Greenbush, New York, introduced the variety, though some\r\nyears later, and it has taken his name. In 1871, the American Pomological\r\nSociety placed the Quackenboss on its recommended fruit list.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, round-topped, hardy, productive;\r\n    branches numerous, ash-gray, the trunk rough but the limbs\r\n    smooth, with smallish raised lenticels; branchlets thick, with\r\n    long internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-drab over\r\n    red, dull, pubescent, with numerous, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    of medium size and length, pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, obovate or oval, variable in size averaging\r\n    one and seven-eighths inches wide by three and five-eighths\r\n    inches long; upper surface very dark green, nearly glabrous,\r\n    with a grooved midrib; lower surface pale green, pubescent;\r\n    apex obtuse, base tapering, margin finely serrate, with small\r\n    black glands; petiole five-eighths inch long, pubescent,\r\n    faintly tinged red, glandless or with from one to four small,\r\n    globose, greenish-yellow glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across,\r\n    white, with a yellow tinge at the tips of the opening buds;\r\n    scattered on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels\r\n    three-quarters inch long, above medium in thickness, finely\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes obtuse, lightly pubescent, glandular-serrate,\r\n    reflexed; petals obovate, crenate, with broad claws of medium\r\n    length; anthers yellow with a reddish tinge; filaments\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous except on the\r\n    ovary, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and five-eighths inches by one\r\n    and three-eighths inches in size, roundish-oval, compressed\r\n    slightly, halves equal; cavity narrow, abrupt; suture shallow,\r\n    often lacking; apex roundish or depressed; color bluish-black,\r\n    with thick bloom; dots numerous, small, yellowish-brown,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem three-quarters inch long, pubescent,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin tender, somewhat astringent;\r\n    flesh deep yellow, juicy, tender, sweet, of pleasant, mild\r\n    flavor; good; stone semi-free, one inch by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, flattened, irregular-oval, tapering to a long, narrow\r\n    neck at the base, bluntly acute at the apex, with rough and\r\n    pitted surfaces; ventral suture prominent, heavily furrowed,\r\n    distinctly ridged; dorsal suture acute, often with a narrow,\r\n    indistinct, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED APRICOT\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Knoop _Fructologie_ =2=:52, 54. 1771. =2.= Kraft _Pom.\r\n    Aust._ =2=:27, Tab. 172 fig. 1. 1796. =3.= Prince _Pom.

Red Apricot is probably an inferior off-shoot of the Apricot\r\nplum although no definite record of its lineage is obtainable. It does\r\nnot seem to have been known until nearly one hundred and fifty years\r\nafter the Apricot was brought to notice. Kraft figured and described a\r\nlong prune-like red plum under this name but because of its shape his\r\nplum was undoubtedly spurious. The variety was rejected by the American\r\nPomological Society in 1856. It is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, shoots glabrous; fruit mid-season, large,\r\n    roundish; color red over yellow; suture shallow; cavity small;\r\n    stem an inch long, stout; flesh yellow, dryish, inferior in\r\n    flavor; poor; freestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED DATE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

It\r\ndoes not seem to have been known as long as Violet Diaper and may be an\r\noff-shoot of the older variety. It probably originated in France, one of\r\nits synonyms, Roche Corbon, having been derived from a small village near\r\nTours. The Mimms plum said to have been raised from a stone of the Blue\r\nPerdrigon about 1800 by Henry Browne, North Mimms Place, Hertfordshire,\r\nEngland, and the Imperial Diadem said to be a seedling of about the same\r\ndate raised at Duckenfield, near Manchester, England, are identical with\r\nRed Diaper in spite of their supposed separate origin. The Chypre, or\r\nPrune de Chypre, thought by some to be a synonym of this variety, is\r\nundoubtedly distinct, as it is a clingstone and is earlier. The following\r\ndescription is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree of slow growth in the nursery, hardy, vigorous and\r\n    productive in the orchard. Fruit mid-season; large, obovate;\r\n    cavity slight; stem one-half inch in length; skin brownish-red;\r\n    bloom thin; dots very numerous, brownish, conspicuous; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, firm, fine-grained, sweet; good; stone small,\r\n    free.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED JUNE\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

Shiro Smomo 9.\r\n\r\nRed June is variously estimated by fruit-growers and pomologists. A\r\nconcensus of the opinions of those who have had actual experience with\r\nthe variety shows that it closely follows Abundance and Burbank in\r\npopularity among the Trifloras. The variety is distinguished from all\r\nother plums by its fruit-characters; the plums are distinctly cordate\r\nin shape with a deep cavity and a very pointed apex; the color is a\r\nmottled garnet-red overlaid with thin but very distinct and delicate\r\nbloom; the flesh is a light yellow, firm enough to endure transportation\r\nwell, peculiarly aromatized, sweetish and not wholly agreeable in flavor\r\nand ranking rather low in quality; the stone adheres tightly to the\r\nflesh. The trees are large, vigorous, spreading, hardy, healthy and\r\nproductive—very good for the species to which the variety belongs. Other\r\ngood qualities of the variety are that it blooms late for a Triflora, and\r\nthat the fruits are comparatively immune to curculio and brown-rot and\r\nhang to the trees exceptionally well for an early plum. This is one of\r\nthe Trifloras that varies in season of ripening, a peculiarity of several\r\nof the varieties of this species, but usually the fruits ripen a week or\r\nmore before Abundance. Red June is reported to be somewhat self-sterile\r\nand in need of cross-pollination. This variety ought to have value as an\r\nearly market plum in New York.\r\n\r\nRed June was imported from Japan by H. H. Berger and Company, San\r\nFrancisco, California, under the name Shiro Smomo, about 1887. Stark\r\nBrothers, Louisiana, Missouri, obtained the variety in 1892 and\r\nintroduced it as the Red June in 1893. In 1897 it was added to the fruit\r\ncatalog list of the American Pomological Society. The nomenclature of\r\nthis variety is much confused. The true Japanese Red Nagate (Red Nagate\r\nis one of the synonyms of Red June) has red flesh while this one has not;\r\nthis variety, to which the name Shiro Smomo is most often applied, is not\r\na Smomo plum nor is it white, (Shiro is the Japanese for white) affording\r\nanother instance of the confusion in the American application of the\r\nJapanese names of the Triflora plums.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive,\r\n    healthy; branches rough, thorny, dark brown, with numerous\r\n    lenticels of medium size; branchlets slender, long, with short\r\n    internodes, dark brown, marked with considerable scarf-skin,\r\n    glabrous, with numerous large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    small, medium in length, conical, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oblanceolate, one inch wide, two and\r\n    three-quarters inches long, thin; upper surface glabrous, with\r\n    a lightly grooved midrib; lower surface light green, thinly\r\n    pubescent along the midrib and larger veins which are tinged\r\n    red; apex taper-pointed, base acuminate, margin finely serrate,\r\n    with small glands; petiole one-half inch long, slender, tinged\r\n    red, slightly hairy along one side, with from one to three\r\n    small, brown glands usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing before the leaves, white; borne in clusters on\r\n    lateral buds and spurs, in twos or in threes; pedicels of\r\n    medium length and thickness, glabrous except for occasional\r\n    hairs, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, sparingly glandular, with marginal\r\n    hairs, glabrous on the outer side, thinly pubescent on the\r\n    inner side, erect; petals oval, entire, tapering at the base\r\n    to short claws; anthers light yellow; filaments short; pistil\r\n    glabrous, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, one and one-half inches by one and three-eighths\r\n    inches in size, roundish-ovate to roundish-cordate, sides\r\n    unequal; cavity large, deep, narrow, regular, abrupt; suture\r\n    deep, distinct; apex very pointed; color garnet-red, mottled;\r\n    bloom thin; dots numerous, small, russet; stem one-half inch\r\n    long, adhering to the fruit; skin above medium in thickness,\r\n    tender, slightly astringent, separating easily; flesh light\r\n    yellow, fibrous, somewhat meaty, sweet except near the center;\r\n    good; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by one-half inch in\r\n    size, irregular-oval, slightly flattened, pointed at both\r\n    ends, with pitted surfaces; ventral suture prominently winged,\r\n    narrow; dorsal suture not grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED MAGNUM BONUM\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

It was mentioned by all of the\r\nearly horticultural writers and it seems clear that the variety was\r\nwell established in Europe at least as early as the beginning of the\r\nSeventeenth Century. As all plums at that time were propagated from\r\nseed, a large number of sub-varieties of this sort were produced and as\r\nthese became established the nomenclature of the variety became much\r\ninvolved. In 1729 Langley called it the Red Magnum Bonum, a name it has\r\nsince retained. It is not known when the variety was introduced into this\r\ncountry but its first appearance in American literature was in 1803.\r\nAfter its introduction nurserymen sold any large red plum as Red Magnum\r\nBonum and it became difficult to find the true variety. Professor J. L.\r\nBudd apparently reintroduced this plum in 1881-1882 under the name Dame\r\nAubert Rouge. Although very extensively grown in America at one time\r\nit has never been a favorite because of its poor quality. The American\r\nPomological Society rejected it in 1858 from a list of candidates for its\r\ncatalog. The following description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree hardy, vigorous, productive; young shoots glabrous. Fruit\r\n    mid-season; large, oval, deep red in the sun, pale red in the\r\n    shade, covered with thin bloom; stem one inch long; flesh\r\n    greenish, firm, slightly coarse, dry, brisk subacid; of fair\r\n    quality; stone oval, free.\r\n\r\n\r\nREINE CLAUDE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Quintinye _Com.

For the qualities that gratify or\r\nassist in gratifying the sense of taste,—richness of flavor, consistency\r\nand texture of flesh, abundance of juice and pleasant aroma,—the Reine\r\nClaude is unsurpassed. It is, however, now probably equalled in quality\r\nby several of the great number of similar varieties which have originated\r\nin America and for which American plum-growing is justly distinguished.\r\nUnder ordinary cultivation the Reine Claude is not a remarkably handsome\r\nplum but when grown on thrifty trees, the crop thinned, foliage and fruit\r\nkept free from pests and the fruits sufficiently exposed to the sun to\r\ncolor well, it is a beautiful fruit, its size, form and color all adding\r\nto its beauty. The tree is only of moderate size in the orchard and in\r\nthe nursery is so small and wayward that nurserymen hesitate to grow it.\r\nThe trees, though small, are productive and bear regularly, the chief\r\ndefect being the susceptibility to sunscald whereby the bark on the trunk\r\nis killed and the beginning of the end is marked. The short life of the\r\ntrees of this variety is largely due to this injury to the bark and has\r\nled to top-working on Lombard and other stocks, an operation successful\r\nonly when done early in the life of the stock. Another serious fault is\r\nthat the fruit cracks badly if showers occur at ripening time. Reine\r\nClaude is still one of the most profitable plums grown in New York and\r\nwhether for the commercial or home plantation deserves a place in the\r\nplum orchard.\r\n\r\nFor a complete history of this variety the reader is referred to the\r\ndiscussion of the Reine Claude group of plums. The Bavay, a distinct\r\nvariety, is called the true Reine Claude by many nurserymen and\r\nhorticultural writers. Green Gage is a synonym of the Reine Claude and\r\nis preferred by some writers for this plum but since “Reine Claude” is\r\nas well known and much older it has been retained in _The Plums of New\r\nYork_.

The plums are attractive in coloring but small in size\r\nand comparatively low in quality. The trees are capricious in growth and\r\nnot as hardy as some others of the species but where they can be grown\r\nare always productive. The variety is rated by some authors among those\r\nthat need cross-pollination to insure large crops. Robinson may be worth\r\ngrowing in the South and in the States of the Plains but it cannot be\r\nrecommended for any purpose in New York.\r\n\r\nThis variety is a seedling grown by a Mr. Pickett of Putnam County,\r\nIndiana, from a seed brought with him from North Carolina about 1835. In\r\n1879, Dr. J. H. Robinson read a paper before the Indiana Horticultural\r\nSociety on Chicasaw plums, and gave a very flattering description of this\r\nplum, which he had been growing since 1872. Later it was named by the\r\nPutnam County Horticultural Society in honor of Dr. Robinson. This name\r\nwas used as a synonym of Miner by Downing in 1869 but at the present time\r\nthat usage has almost disappeared in plum literature.\r\n\r\n    Tree variable in size, often large, vigorous, spreading, not\r\n    uniform in habit, somewhat open and flat-topped, hardy, medium\r\n    to productive; trunk shaggy; branches very rough, zigzag,\r\n    thorny, dark ash-gray, with numerous, large, narrow and\r\n    strongly elongated, raised lenticels; branchlets slender to\r\n    medium, with internodes medium to below in length, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dull, dark chestnut-red, glabrous, with numerous\r\n    very conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small,\r\n    short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, lanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    five-sixteenths inches wide, three and one-half inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface dark green, glabrous, with deeply grooved\r\n    midrib; lower surface glabrous except along the midrib and\r\n    larger veins; apex taper-pointed, base obtuse, margin very\r\n    finely serrate, with small, dark red glands; petiole slender,\r\n    five-eighths inch long, reddish, lightly pubescent along one\r\n    side, glandless or with from one to seven small, globose,\r\n    reddish-brown glands on the stalk and on the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late, long; flowers appearing\r\n    with the leaves, eleven-sixteenths inch across, whitish,\r\n    somewhat self-fertile; borne in clusters on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, in twos, threes or fours; pedicels seven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    narrow-campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, slightly\r\n    obtuse, glandular, pubescent and with marginal hairs, erect;\r\n    petals ovate or oval, small, narrow, slightly crenate, tapering\r\n    below to long, narrow claws; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous, slightly shorter than\r\n    or equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season very long; less than an inch in diameter,\r\n    roundish or roundish-oval, halves equal; cavity of medium\r\n    depth and width, abrupt; suture a line; apex roundish;\r\n    color clear currant-red, overspread with thick bloom; dots\r\n    scattering, large, russet, conspicuous, clustered around the\r\n    apex; stem slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous, adhering\r\n    to the fruit; skin tough, bitter, separating readily; flesh\r\n    golden-yellow, very juicy, somewhat fibrous, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet next the skin, with some astringency near the\r\n    center, of mild but pleasant flavor; fair in quality; stone\r\n    clinging, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size,\r\n    oval, turgid, very slightly flattened and necked at the base,\r\n    abrupt-pointed at the apex, roughish; ventral suture blunt,\r\n    slightly ridged; dorsal suture with a rather broad groove of\r\n    medium depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLINGSTONE\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rural N.

Rolling Stone 3, 4.\r\n\r\nRollingstone is an old Americana sort which has been kept in cultivation\r\nchiefly because it is of very good quality for one of its species.\r\nThe fruit is rather dull in color and small but not unattractive in\r\nappearance; the plums are little troubled by either the brown-rot or the\r\nplum curculio and ship very well because of the tough skin. The tree is\r\ndwarfish with a crooked trunk, shaggy bark, unkempt top and very twiggy—a\r\ntypical Americana and most difficult to grow into a good orchard plant.\r\nThe variety is characterized by long, conspicuous stamens, stigmas\r\nfrequently defective and by very large leaves. The variety has little or\r\nno value in New York.\r\n\r\nRollingstone was found near an old Indian camping ground on the\r\nRollingstone Creek, Winona County, Minnesota, by Mr. O. M. Lord,[220]\r\nMinnesota City, about 1852. Mr. Lord planted trees of this plum in his\r\ngarden and found that they improved greatly under cultivation, so much\r\nso that they soon became very popular in the local market. About 1882\r\nhe introduced the Rollingstone to fruit-growers in general. Mr. H.\r\nM. Thompson of St. Francis, according to the Minnesota Horticultural\r\nSociety Report for 1885, sent this plum out under the name Minnesota but\r\nfortunately it has not been distributed under its synonym widely enough\r\nto cause much confusion. In 1897 the American Pomological Society added\r\nRollingstone to its fruit catalog list.\r\n\r\n    Tree dwarfish, variable in vigor, spreading, flat-topped,\r\n    hardy, productive, healthy; trunk shaggy; branches dark\r\n    ash-gray, thorny, rough, zigzag, with numerous, rather large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets slender, twiggy, medium to short, with\r\n    internodes of average length, greenish turning to dark brown,\r\n    glossy, glabrous, with conspicuous, small, raised lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds medium in size and length, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, obovate or long-ovate,\r\n    one and one-half inches wide, three and one-half inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface smooth, glabrous, with a narrow groove on\r\n    the midrib; lower surface silvery green, lightly pubescent, the\r\n    veins prominent; apex taper-pointed, base rather acute, margin\r\n    coarsely and doubly serrate, eglandular; petiole slender,\r\n    five-eighths inch long, tinged red, sparingly pubescent,\r\n    glandless or with one or two small, globose, reddish glands on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves; three-quarters inch across, the buds creamy-white\r\n    changing to white as the flowers expand; borne in clusters\r\n    on lateral buds and spurs, in threes or in fours; pedicels\r\n    seven-sixteenths inch long, below medium in thickness,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube reddish-green, obconic, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, acute, eglandular, glabrous on the outer\r\n    surface but lightly pubescent within, heavily pubescent on the\r\n    margin and with irregular deep serrations, erect; petals oval\r\n    or slightly ovate, dentate, tapering below into narrow claws\r\n    reddish at the base; stamens conspicuous; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length; stigma often abortive.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season or earlier, ripening period short; about\r\n    one inch in diameter, roundish, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, flaring, marked before maturity with light-colored,\r\n    radiating streaks; suture a line; apex roundish; color dark\r\n    purplish-red, with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, light\r\n    russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, nine-sixteenths inch long,\r\n    adhering poorly to the fruit; skin thick, tough, semi-adherent;\r\n    flesh orange-yellow, juicy, slightly fibrous, tender and\r\n    melting, sweet, strongly aromatic; good; stone semi-free,\r\n    five-eighths inch by one-half inch in size, roundish-oval,\r\n    flattened, smoothish, blunt at the base and apex; ventral\r\n    suture acute, faintly ridged; dorsal suture acute, with a\r\n    narrow, shallow, indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL TOURS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

Although highly esteemed in Europe, it\r\nhas not gained favor in this country and is rarely found here. Waugh\r\nstates that in 1899 he secured specimens of it from North Carolina where\r\nit was grown locally under the name Worth. The following description is\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree strong, vigorous; branches thick, short, smooth; fruit\r\n    early mid-season; of medium size, irregularly roundish, swollen\r\n    on one side, dark reddish-purple covered with thick bloom;\r\n    cavity deep; suture prominent; stem short, thick; skin thick,\r\n    firm; dots conspicuous; flesh greenish-yellow, firm, sweet;\r\n    very good; stone large, oblong, rough, clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTLAND PLUMCOT\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_ × _Prunus armeniaca_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Burbank _Cat._ 13 fig. 1901. =2.= De Vries _Pl.

Not having seen the fruit of this remarkable cross we are\r\nunable to judge of its value to the plum-grower. Out of a large number\r\nof extremely variable seedlings of this cross Burbank selected this, the\r\nRutland Plumcot, named in honor of an Australian admirer of the fruit.\r\nThe variety was introduced by the Fancher Creek Nursery in 1906 and 1907.\r\nThe following description is partly compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, spreading, open, not a heavy bearer; branches\r\n    thorny; branchlets rather slender, with short internodes, dull\r\n    red; leaves folded upward, oval, one and five-eighths inches\r\n    wide, two and seven-eighths inches long, rather stiff; margin\r\n    finely and doubly crenate, glandular; petiole greenish-red,\r\n    with from one to four globose glands.\r\n\r\n    The fruit in California attains a large size; suture and cavity\r\n    deep; skin fuzzy like an apricot, purple; flesh deep red,\r\n    subacid; quality fair; stone large, broad-oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT CATHERINE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Quintinye _Com.

It is,\r\nhowever, one of the well-known sorts in Europe, especially in France\r\nwhere it is used for prune-making. It appears to be of the Reine Claude\r\ngroup in which group America has so many plums of surpassing merit that\r\nthis one has no place on this side of the Atlantic. It is included in\r\n_The Plums of New York_ largely because of its historic interest and\r\nbecause there seems to be no complete description of it made from trees\r\nand fruits grown on this continent.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this old plum is unknown. It was first mentioned by\r\nQuintinye in 1699. Wherever it originated, it is now grown most\r\nextensively in France and is known to commerce as the Prune of Tours.\r\nThe people in Northern Italy cultivate it under the name Torlo d’Ovo\r\n(References, 9). The Belgians have used Saint Catherine incorrectly\r\nfor the Imperiale Violette (References, 14). In America, according to\r\nKenrick, it was not uncommon around Boston in 1832 but it evidently\r\ndid not receive much recognition, for the United States Patent Office\r\nreimported it from France in 1854 and distributed it in the northeastern\r\npart of this country. The American Pomological Society added it to its\r\nfruit catalog list in 1862 and dropped it in 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, usually hardy, productive;\r\n    branches sparingly thorny, light ash-brown, smooth except\r\n    for the few raised lenticels; branchlets thick, long, with\r\n    long internodes, greenish-red changing to dark reddish-brown,\r\n    marked with scarf-skin, nearly glabrous throughout the season,\r\n    with few, conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds of\r\n    medium size and length, conical or pointed, broad at the base,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, oval, one and one-half inches wide, three\r\n    inches long; upper surface lightly pubescent, with a grooved\r\n    midrib; lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex and\r\n    base acute, margin crenate, with small, dark glands; petiole\r\n    three-quarters inch long, thick, with a red tinge, pubescent,\r\n    glandless or with from one to three conspicuous, globose,\r\n    bright yellow glands variable in size, usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate, long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, white, the buds tinged yellow as they\r\n    open; borne on lateral spurs, in twos or in threes; pedicels\r\n    nearly one inch long, slender, with thin pubescence, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes small,\r\n    narrow, acute, pubescent on the inner surface, erect; petals\r\n    oval, entire, not clawed; anthers yellow with a tinge of red;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to\r\n    the stamens in length, often abortive.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, intermediate in length of ripening season; small,\r\n    obovate or oval, slightly necked, truncate at the base,\r\n    compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow, flaring;\r\n    suture varies from shallow to deep, often prominent; apex\r\n    depressed; color dull green, changing to golden-yellow,\r\n    overspread with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, gray,\r\n    inconspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem slender, very\r\n    long, often one and one-eighth inches in length, glabrous,\r\n    adhering well to the fruit; skin thick, tough, clinging\r\n    slightly; flesh light golden-yellow, juicy, fibrous, sweet,\r\n    mild, pleasant, not high in flavor; good; stone clinging,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, oval, flattened,\r\n    slightly acute at the base and apex, with roughened surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture finely grooved, blunt; dorsal suture with a\r\n    wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT JULIEN\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Miller _Gard.

Whether the name was\r\never applied to a specific variety can not be said. Miller, in 1754,\r\ndescribed a “St. Julian” and gave its chief use as a stock for plums,\r\npeaches and Bruxelles Apricot. Later writers recommend them chiefly, if\r\nnot only, as stocks though in France it is said the fruits are dried and\r\nsold by the pharmacists and herbalists under the name _Prunus medicines_\r\n(medicinal prunes). Carrière, in _Revue Horticole_ 1892, speaks very\r\nhighly of these plums as stocks and describes them as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Tree vigorous, with branches spreading-straggling, relatively\r\n    short, branched at the extremity. Leaves numerous, slightly\r\n    roughened by the prominence of the numerous nerves on the lower\r\n    surface, short, oblong, usually rounded at the apex, attenuated\r\n    at the base, where are found a few very small glands; petiole\r\n    about two centimeters long, yellowish, lengthening out\r\n    into a prominent midrib; buds short, oval, pointed, deep\r\n    reddish-brown; dark green above, pale green below, bordered\r\n    regularly with very close, short, slightly inclined teeth.\r\n\r\n    Fruits very abundant, pedunculate, spherical or oblong,\r\n    peduncle a little bent, rather strong, nearly three centimeters\r\n    long, inserted in a very small cavity, regularly rounded. Skin\r\n    strongly attached to the flesh, even, glossy, purplish-black,\r\n    more or less glaucous; flesh free from the seed, pulpy, very\r\n    juicy, soft, greenish, sweet, leaving a taste a little strong,\r\n    but not disagreeable; seed short oval, elliptical, flattened,\r\n    ten millimeters in width, nearly fifteen to sixteen millimeters\r\n    in length, with grayish-red surface roughened by small, regular\r\n    projections. Matures from July to September.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT MARTIN\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond. Hort. Soc.

Of these red-fleshed\r\nplums, Satsuma was the first to be introduced into fruit-growing in\r\nAmerica and is one of the parents of most of the others. While the fruit\r\nis not as large nor as handsome in color as in some of its offspring, it\r\nis still one of the best varieties for quality of fruit and its trees\r\nare possibly as good as those of any of the other sorts of red-fleshed\r\nTrifloras. Satsuma, besides being one of the best of its class in quality\r\nfor either dessert or culinary purposes, keeps and ships very well and if\r\nthe plums are of sufficient size and have been allowed to color properly,\r\nthe variety makes a good showing on the markets. Too often, however, it\r\nis so unattractive as it reaches the market that it does not sell well.\r\nIn the South the plums are said to be much attacked by brown-rot but they\r\nare not more susceptible here than other plums. The trees are rather\r\nabove the average for the species in size, habit, health, hardiness and\r\nproductiveness though they bear sparingly when young. They bloom early in\r\nthe season and are distinguished from other Triflora sorts by having many\r\nspurs and short branches along the main branches. Satsuma might possibly\r\nbe found worth growing commercially in a very small way in some parts of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nSatsuma was raised from the same lot of plum pits from which the Burbank\r\ncame, the seeds having been sent to Luther Burbank by a Japanese agent\r\nin 1883. In 1887 Burbank’s tree was the only bearing one in America but\r\nsince then it has been tested in all of the large plum regions, having\r\nbeen introduced by Burbank in 1889. In 1897 it was added to the fruit\r\ncatalog list of the American Pomological Society. Even though this\r\nplum is very distinct, with its solid red flesh, it is much confused\r\nwith other sorts. A Japanese in a letter[222] to L. A. Berckmans says\r\n“Beni-Smomo comprises a group of red-fleshed plums. In Satsuma, my\r\nnative home, Hon-smomo and Yone-smomo are the most noted and familiar\r\nfruits of this group, the first is the smallest in size and deepest in\r\ncolor, while the second is the largest and most highly esteemed. In some\r\ndistricts, plums in this group are called Uchi-Beni, which means red\r\ninside.” Hon-smomo or Blood Plum No. 4 was separated from the Satsuma\r\nor Yonemomo by the Georgia Horticultural Society but Bailey found them\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, upright-spreading, usually\r\n    quite hardy, moderately productive, bearing heavier crops as\r\n    the tree becomes older; branches grayish-brown; branchlets\r\n    medium to above in thickness and length, with short internodes,\r\n    dark chestnut-red, glabrous, with slightly raised lenticels\r\n    of medium number and size; leaf-buds small, short, conical,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves somewhat lanceolate, four inches by one and one-half\r\n    inches in size, of medium thickness; upper surface dark green,\r\n    with a shallow, grooved midrib; lower surface light green,\r\n    glabrous; margin finely and doubly crenate, glandular; petiole\r\n    three-quarters inch long, tinged red, with from one to three\r\n    reniform, greenish-yellow glands variable in size, usually at\r\n    the base of the blade.\r\n\r\n    Blossoms white; borne in pairs or in threes; pedicels\r\n    nine-sixteenths inch long, slender, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes medium in\r\n    width, acute, somewhat serrate, with dark colored glands,\r\n    glabrous, erect; petals tapering below to claws of medium\r\n    length, reddish at the base.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season or later; one and seven-eighths inches\r\n    by two inches in size, variable in shape, ranging from\r\n    roundish-cordate to somewhat oblate, flattened at the base,\r\n    compressed, halves unequal; cavity deep, narrow, abrupt,\r\n    compressed; suture variable in depth, prominent; apex pointed\r\n    or roundish; color dark dull red, with thin bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, of medium size, russet, somewhat conspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the apex; stem slender, three-eighths inch\r\n    long, glabrous; skin of medium thickness and toughness, bitter,\r\n    semi-adherent; flesh dark purplish-red, juicy, tender at the\r\n    skin, becoming tough at the center, sweet, with an almond-like\r\n    flavor; of good quality; stone semi-clinging or clinging,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval, strongly\r\n    pointed, rough, tinged red; ventral suture narrow, winged;\r\n    dorsal suture grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUNDERS\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Am.

But on the grounds of this Station, fruiting for several\r\nyears, the plums have been inferior in size and somewhat so in quality\r\nand all told much less attractive than a number of other sorts of the\r\nsame season. Saunders originated with John Arris of Belleville, Ontario,\r\nCanada. It was first exhibited before the Fruit-Growers’ Association\r\nof Ontario at St. Catherines in 1883. In 1884, upon its being again\r\nexhibited before the same association, it was named Saunders in honor of\r\nthe society’s noted president. The variety was mentioned in the catalog\r\nof the American Pomological Society in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, round-topped, very productive; branchlets\r\n    brash, slender, very pubescent; leaves flattened, obovate or\r\n    oval, one and three-quarters inches wide, four inches long,\r\n    somewhat velvety, rugose; margin finely serrate, eglandular or\r\n    with small dark glands; petiole pubescent, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three small glands; blooming season intermediate in\r\n    time and length; flowers appearing after the leaves, one and\r\n    one-quarter inches across, white; borne on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, usually singly; pedicels very pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and one-half inches by one\r\n    and one-eighth inches in size, oblong-oval, greenish-yellow\r\n    changing to golden-yellow, covered with thin bloom; skin thin,\r\n    tender, slightly sour, cracking when fully mature; flesh\r\n    yellowish, tender and melting, sweet, mild; of good quality;\r\n    stone free, one inch by five-eighths inch in size, long-oval,\r\n    flattened, with rough surfaces; ventral suture winged; dorsal\r\n    suture with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERGEANT\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

Downing described the variety but thought\r\nit identical with the Victoria, as did other writers, as will be seen\r\nby referring to the Victoria. H. A. Pearson in the _Journal of the\r\nRoyal Horticultural Society_, comparing these two sorts says, “Sharp’s\r\nEmperor is a second rate plum, resembling Victoria, in appearance, but\r\nvery inferior in point of cropping and quality, a decided clingstone,\r\noften gumming at the stone, and ripening a fortnight later than its\r\nsupposed synonym, not worthy of cultivation.” August Royer in the _Annals\r\nde Pomologie Belge et Etrangere_ also separated the two varieties but\r\ndescribes them both as freestones. While there is a lack of uniformity\r\nin the descriptions yet the total evidence weighs in favor of two types\r\nwhich are very similar. The Victoria is probably the better plum of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELDRAKE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\nAlthough extremely vigorous and productive this variety is so inferior\r\nin quality as to be of doubtful value. Sheldrake originated as a chance\r\nseedling on the shore of Cayuga Lake near the town of Sheldrake, New\r\nYork. It was discovered and propagated by J. T. Hunt of Kendaia, New\r\nYork, and has been under test at the Geneva Station since 1895.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, productive; branchlets\r\n    thick, with long internodes, pubescent; leaves drooping,\r\n    somewhat flattened, oval, nearly two and one-half inches wide,\r\n    four and one-quarter inches long; margin serrate with few,\r\n    small, dark glands; petiole pubescent, tinged red, thick,\r\n    glandless or with from one to four rather large glands usually\r\n    at the base of the leaf; blooming season intermediate in time,\r\n    short; flowers appearing after the leaves, nearly one and\r\n    one-quarter inches across; borne singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit rather early; one and one-half inches by one and\r\n    three-eighths inches in size, roundish-oblong; cavity very\r\n    deep, abrupt; color purplish-black, overspread with thick\r\n    bloom; dots conspicuous; stem thickly pubescent; skin thin,\r\n    tender, slightly acid; flesh yellow, tender, sweet next the\r\n    skin, but sour near the center, inferior in flavor; poor\r\n    in quality; stone dark-colored, semi-clinging, one inch by\r\n    three-quarters inch in size, broadly ovate or irregularly oval,\r\n    flattened, with roughened and granular surfaces; ventral suture\r\n    prominent, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIPPER]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

The flesh is dry and the plums often\r\nshrivel on the tree, characters which fit it for shipping, but which when\r\ntaken with poor quality and small size make it of little value after it\r\nreaches the market. Moreover it fruits sparingly under many conditions,\r\nthough productive here, and the plums ripen somewhat unevenly and are\r\nsusceptible to brown-rot. Some pomologists give a rather better estimate\r\nof the variety than that expressed here, but from all data at hand the\r\nvalue of the plum is not underestimated in the above statements. There\r\nare a great many better plums for New York than Shipper.\r\n\r\nThis variety was introduced by Mr. H. S. Wiley of Cayuga, New York. The\r\nplum was found by Mr. Wiley in a private garden at Port Byron, New York,\r\nabout 1877. The man upon whose place it grew thought that it came from a\r\nstone of one of the several varieties in his garden but Mr. Wiley is not\r\nsure of this origin and suggests that it may have sprouted from a root.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, hardy, productive;\r\n    branches thick, ash-gray, smooth except for the raised\r\n    lenticels; branchlets of medium thickness and length, with\r\n    long internodes, green changing to brownish-drab and with a\r\n    red tinge, dull, covered with thick pubescence throughout the\r\n    season, with inconspicuous lenticels of medium number and size;\r\n    leaf-buds small, short, conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves many, flattened or folded upward, obovate or oval, one\r\n    and three-quarters inches wide, three and one-half inches\r\n    long, thick, leathery; upper surface dark green, hairy, with a\r\n    grooved midrib; lower surface silvery-green, thick, pubescent;\r\n    apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin serrate or\r\n    crenate, eglandular or with small dark glands; petiole one-half\r\n    inch long, thick, pubescent, with a red tinge, glandless or\r\n    with one or two globose, yellowish-green glands usually at the\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, nearly one and one-quarter inches\r\n    across, white; borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels three-quarters inch long, pubescent, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes obtuse,\r\n    lightly pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate and with\r\n    marginal hairs, reflexed; petals broadly oval or obovate,\r\n    slightly crenate or occasionally notched, with short, broad\r\n    claws; anthers yellow; filaments five-sixteenths inch long;\r\n    pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, intermediate in length of ripening season; one\r\n    and one-half inches by one and three-eighths inches in\r\n    size, ovate, swollen on the suture side, compressed, halves\r\n    equal; cavity shallow, abrupt; suture shallow; apex bluntly\r\n    pointed; color purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom;\r\n    dots small, russet, somewhat conspicuous; stem seven-eighths\r\n    inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow, rather\r\n    tart, firm, sweet, mild in flavor; inferior in quality;\r\n    stone semi-clinging, often with red tinge near the edge,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by three-quarters inch in size, irregular\r\n    roundish-ovate, turgid, rough, blunt at the base and apex;\r\n    ventral suture wide, ridged, distinctly winged; dorsal suture\r\n    wide, deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIRO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIRO]\r\n\r\n_Prunus simonii × Prunus triflora × Prunus cerasifera × Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

As the variety grows on the grounds of\r\nthis Station, the fruits are large and handsome in form and color, as is\r\nwell shown in the illustration. The flavor lacks character and is almost\r\ninsipid but the flesh is tender, melting and juicy and so translucent\r\nthat the pit can be seen through the flesh. Despite the flavor, the\r\nplum is pleasant to eat and may be ranked as good in quality. Those who\r\nhave had experience say that the variety ships very well if not fully\r\nmature but quickly goes down after ripening; the plums are also quite\r\nsusceptible to brown-rot. The trees of this variety at Geneva are quite\r\nas vigorous, hardy, and productive as any of the sorts which Mr. Burbank\r\ngives as progenitors of Shiro and will generally, it is believed, surpass\r\nany of them in these respects. It may here be remarked that of the four\r\nspecies from which Shiro is supposed to have come, it most resembles\r\n_Prunus triflora_ in both tree and fruit though the leaves have some\r\nresemblance to those of _Prunus cerasifera_. Shiro is still, so far as\r\nNew York is concerned, in the list of plums deserving trial but with the\r\nchances against its becoming of great value either for home or commercial\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThis is another of Burbank’s plums and is said to be a descendant of\r\nRobinson, (_Prunus munsoniana_,) Myrobalan, (_Prunus cerasifera_), and\r\nWickson, (a cross of _Prunus triflora_ and _Prunus simonii_) from seed of\r\nWickson. Burbank in his catalog for 1889 says that the tree resembles a\r\nMyrobalan in foliage, growth and general appearance. But as the variety\r\ngrows at this Station it has all the appearances of a Triflora. Shiro was\r\ndescribed in the California State Board of Horticulture Report for 1898\r\nand the following year it was introduced by the originator.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, tender to cold,\r\n    productive; branches smooth, somewhat thorny, dull ash-gray,\r\n    with few, small lenticels; branchlets slender, above medium\r\n    in length, with short internodes, greenish-red changing to\r\n    brownish-drab, glabrous, with inconspicuous, scattering, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds small, very short, obtuse, strongly\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate, one and five-sixteenths inches\r\n    wide, two and three-quarters inches long, leathery; upper\r\n    surface faintly rugose, glabrous, with a grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface lightly pubescent along the midrib and larger veins;\r\n    apex acutely pointed, base rather acute, margin finely crenate,\r\n    with small, dark glands; petiole three-eighths inch long,\r\n    pubescent along one side, greenish-red, glandless or with one\r\n    or two small, globose, yellowish glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers appearing\r\n    before the leaves, white; borne in clusters on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs; pedicels short, glabrous, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, glandular-serrate,\r\n    glabrous on the outer side, sparingly pubescent within, with a\r\n    pink margin, erect; petals roundish, entire, tapering to short,\r\n    abrupt claws; anthers yellow with a reddish tinge; filaments\r\n    below medium in length; pistil glabrous, longer than the\r\n    stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season short; one and one-half inches\r\n    in diameter, roundish-conic, with halves equal; cavity\r\n    intermediate in depth and width, flaring, regular; suture an\r\n    indistinct line; apex roundish; color light yellow becoming\r\n    deeper yellow as the season advances, occasionally with a\r\n    blush of pink, with thin bloom; dots numerous, very minute,\r\n    whitish, inconspicuous; stem three-eighths inch long, adhering\r\n    to the fruit; skin thin, tough, sour, occasionally cracking,\r\n    separating readily, although a thin coating of flesh is left\r\n    clinging to the skin; flesh light yellow, semi-transparent,\r\n    the stone being faintly visible, very juicy, fibrous, somewhat\r\n    melting, sweet, mild, lacks character in flavor; good; stone\r\n    clinging, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    broadly oval, flattened, slightly elongated at the base, with\r\n    rough surfaces; ventral suture faintly ridged and furrowed;\r\n    dorsal suture very lightly grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHROPSHIRE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHROPSHIRE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rea Flora_ 209. 1676. =2.= _Lond.

Shropshire Damson 2,\r\n    3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18.\r\n\r\nIn America, Shropshire is probably the best known of the Damsons, being\r\nfound not only in nearly all commercial plantations but in the smallest\r\nhome collections as well. The qualities which make it so generally a\r\nfavorite are for most part those of the tree, the French surpassing it\r\nin size and in quality of the fruit. The trees of the variety under\r\nnotice are not surpassed by any other Insititia in size, vigor, hardiness\r\nand health nor are they, except in size, by any other European plum.\r\nShropshire is enormously productive, bearing its load of fruit year after\r\nyear until it is a standard among fruits for productivity and reliability\r\nin bearing. The trees have but one defect,—unless sprayed the foliage\r\nfalls prey to fungi and drops early. The trees are comparatively easy to\r\nmanage in such orchard operations as pruning, spraying and harvesting\r\nas they are not so thick-topped, twiggy and spiny as other Damsons. The\r\nfruit is of very good size and while in no sense a dessert plum may be\r\neaten out of hand with relish when fully ripe or after a light frost—a\r\npoint worth considering where only Damsons can be grown. It is one of the\r\nbest of its kind for culinary purposes. This old variety is still to be\r\nrecommended for both home and market.\r\n\r\nShropshire originated in England, sometime in the Seventeenth Century.\r\nIt was noted by American writers early in the Nineteenth Century and\r\nin 1875 was placed on the American Pomological Society’s fruit catalog\r\nlist. Shropshire is a more familiar name in fruit literature than the\r\nreferences given indicate, being found in practically every English\r\ndiscussion of plums since 1676 and in all American notices of this fruit\r\nsince Prince wrote in 1832. For a fruit so long under cultivation, it has\r\nfew synonyms.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, vasiform, hardy, productive; main\r\n    branches numerous, ash-gray, smooth except for numerous scars\r\n    from small spur-like branches, with many, small lenticels;\r\n    branchlets twiggy, slender, with short internodes, green\r\n    changing to dark brownish-drab, dull, covered with heavy\r\n    pubescence throughout the season, with numerous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds below medium in size, short, conical,\r\n    appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, obovate, about one inch wide, two inches\r\n    long, thin; upper surface dark green, pubescent along the\r\n    grooved midrib; lower surface a paler green, with thin\r\n    pubescence; apex obtuse or acute, base acute, margin finely\r\n    serrate, eglandular; petiole one-half inch long, slender,\r\n    greenish-red, with little pubescence, glandless or with one or\r\n    two small, globose, greenish-yellow glands usually at the base\r\n    of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium; flowers seven-eighths inch across,\r\n    white; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, singly or\r\n    in pairs; pedicels three-eighths inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, acute, glabrous, the margin glandular-ciliate,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-oval, entire, short-clawed; anthers\r\n    yellow; filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; one and one-half inches by one inch in\r\n    size, oval, compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    flaring; suture an indistinct line; apex roundish; color\r\n    purplish-black, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous,\r\n    small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender, one-half inch long,\r\n    glabrous, adhering to the fruit; skin thin, tender, adhering;\r\n    flesh golden-yellow, juicy, firm but tender, agreeably tart\r\n    at full maturity, sprightly, pleasant; stone clinging,\r\n    three-quarters inch by one-half inch in size, oval, acute at\r\n    the base, blunt at the apex, with nearly smooth surfaces;\r\n    ventral suture broad, blunt; dorsal suture acute, with a\r\n    narrow, shallow, indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON\r\n\r\n_Prunus simonii_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Rev.

Simon’s Plum 5.\r\n\r\nThe Simon plum, a horticultural variety, constitutes the species _Prunus\r\nsimonii_ and has been fully discussed in the chapter of this text dealing\r\nwith the botany of the plum. It is given further notice only to introduce\r\nthe horticultural references and history and to estimate briefly its\r\nvalue in fruit-growing. As to the latter it may be said that the fruit is\r\nfor most people unpalatable, and therefore of little worth as an edible\r\nproduct. Some of the crosses of which this variety is one parent are\r\nwell known and esteemed in pomology and the Simon plum undoubtedly has\r\nvalue for plum-breeding in the future. The tree, where it succeeds, is\r\na handsome ornamental. In New York the variety seems hardy wherever the\r\npeach can be grown and thrives on the same types of soils—sands, gravels\r\nand light loams. The tree is subject to diseases and unless well sprayed\r\nis liable to be short-lived. The variety can be recommended in New York\r\nonly to the breeder of plums and for those who want the tree as an\r\nornamental or a curiosity.\r\n\r\nThis interesting and distinct plum was obtained in China by Eugene Simon,\r\na French consul, who sent it to the Paris Museum of Natural History\r\nin 1867. Later it was disseminated by the nurseries of Simon Brothers\r\nat Plantières-Les-Metz. The date of its introduction into America is\r\nunknown, though it was offered for sale by the eastern nurseries as\r\nearly as 1881. Ellwanger and Barry of Rochester secured their stock from\r\nFrance a few years previous to the date given but whether they were the\r\nonly importers cannot be said. In 1899 the American Pomological Society\r\nadded Simon to its catalog list. The variety is fully described under its\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPSON\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ohio Sta. Bul._ =113=:161. 1899. =2.= _Ibid._ =162=:256, 257.\r\n    1905.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Simpson is too small and is so much below the average of its\r\ntype, that of the Yellow Egg, in quality that it is not worth general\r\nintroduction. It is given attention here chiefly as a matter of record.\r\nAlthough unquestionably a Domestica, Simpson was found growing wild in\r\nthe woods west of Peoria, Illinois. It was introduced by H. Augustine of\r\nNormal, Illinois, about 1888.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, very vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, very\r\n    productive; branchlets slender, with long internodes, thickly\r\n    pubescent; leaf-buds large, long; leaves flattened, oval,\r\n    intermediate in width and length; margin serrate, eglandular;\r\n    petiole pubescent, glandless or with from one to three globose\r\n    glands usually on the stalk; flowers one inch across, borne in\r\n    scattering clusters, singly or in pairs; calyx-lobes thickly\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season; one and one-half inches by one and\r\n    three-eighths inches in size, oval, golden-yellow, covered with\r\n    thin bloom; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, firm but tender, sweet,\r\n    mild; good; stone semi-free, seven-eighths inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, oval, acute at the base; ventral suture usually\r\n    winged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL REINE CLAUDE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

Since the variety\r\nwas known in France and Austria in the latter part of the Eighteenth\r\nCentury it is quite certain that it originated on the continent. From its\r\nname and close resemblance to the Reine Claude it is safe to state that\r\nit is a seedling of that sort. It is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tree of normal vigor; branches smooth; flowers small; fruit\r\n    medium in size, nearly spherical, truncated on the stem side\r\n    and slightly on the apex; suture wide and distinct, thus\r\n    differing from the Reine Claude; stem medium in length; cavity\r\n    shallow; skin tender, yellowish-green, often splashed with red\r\n    on the sunny side; flesh greenish-yellow, fine, a little firm,\r\n    sweet, rich and pleasant; freestone; ripens earlier than the\r\n    Reine Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH ORLEANS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMITH ORLEANS]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

But the fruit is not high in\r\nquality, the texture of the flesh is coarse and it ripens at a time when\r\nfruits are plentiful, for which reasons it has ceased to be regarded with\r\nfavor by either the amateur or the professional fruit-grower. The trees,\r\nhowever, seem to have some remarkably desirable characters and it may\r\nbe that the variety should be retained for some locations and purposes\r\nand to breed from, at least. If the older pomologists have written truly\r\nfew plums are adapted to a greater range of climates and soils than this\r\none; so, too, the trees are usually spoken of as of large size, vigorous,\r\nhealthy, of great productiveness and as holding the crop well. The trees\r\nin the soil and climate of this Station are quite as the older writers\r\ndescribe them and were the fruit only better in quality and somewhat more\r\nattractive in appearance, the variety could be highly recommended for a\r\nmarket plum and as a fruit for culinary purposes in the home orchard.\r\n\r\nWilliam Prince, in 1828, in his _Treatise on Horticulture_, briefly\r\ndescribed Smith Orleans, and seventeen years later A. J. Downing gave\r\na short history of the variety. It is a seedling of the Orleans raised\r\nabout 1825 by a Mr. Smith of Gowanus, Long Island, New York. By an error\r\nthe variety was sent out as the Violet, or Blue Perdrigon, a smaller and\r\nvery different fruit. Charles M. Hovey of Massachusetts, who secured\r\ntrees of the Cooper from Prince, about 1831, believed this variety to\r\nbe identical with the Smith Orleans in all characters. Downing could\r\nnot agree with him but the present writers find that the two varieties\r\nare so much alike that it is impossible to distinguish between them. As\r\nis suggested under Cooper, they may be identical or they may have come\r\ntrue to seed from the same parent. The American Pomological Society\r\nrecommended this plum for general cultivation in 1856.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, very productive;\r\n    trunk rather rough; branches smooth, with few lenticels;\r\n    branchlets of medium thickness and length, with long\r\n    internodes, green changing to dark brownish-red, covered with\r\n    thin bloom, lightly pubescent early in the season becoming\r\n    almost glabrous at maturity, with few, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds of medium size and length, conical, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened or somewhat folded backward, obovate, two\r\n    inches wide, three and five-eighths inches long, thick,\r\n    velvety; upper surface dark green, rugose, with but few\r\n    hairs along the narrow, deeply grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    silvery-green, covered with thick pubescence; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed or acute, base acute, margin crenate, with few small,\r\n    dark brown glands; petiole one-half inch long, heavily\r\n    pubescent, tinged red along one side, glandless or with one or\r\n    two small, globose, yellow glands usually at the base of the\r\n    leaf.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves, one and one-quarter inches across, white, with a yellow\r\n    tinge; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs; pedicels\r\n    five-eighths inch long, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, with few scattering hairs; calyx-lobes above\r\n    medium in width, obtuse, sparingly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, reflexed; petals\r\n    broad-obovate or oval, crenate, tapering to long claws of\r\n    medium width; anthers yellow, filaments seven-sixteenths inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season, one\r\n    and five-eighths inches by one and one-half inches in size,\r\n    oval, compressed, halves somewhat unequal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture very shallow or sometimes a line; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color dark purplish-black, overspread\r\n    with thick bloom; dots numerous small, russet, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem three-quarters inch long, pubescent, adhering to the\r\n    fruit; skin below medium in thickness, tender, sour, separating\r\n    readily; flesh pale yellow, juicy, tender, sweet, of pleasant\r\n    flavor; good; stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths inch in\r\n    size, oval, with very rough and deeply pitted surfaces, usually\r\n    somewhat flattened, tapering abruptly at the base, blunt at the\r\n    apex; ventral suture wide, blunt; dorsal suture with a groove\r\n    variable in depth and width.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOPHIE\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

Without any very distinct merits it yet stands high\r\namong plums of its kind. The variety is a seedling of Wild Goose at first\r\nsupposed by the originator, J. W. Kerr,[223] of Denton, Maryland, to\r\nhave been pollinated by a German Prune which stood near. This is hardly\r\nthe case, however, as no trace of Domestica blood can be detected in\r\nthe variety. It is mentioned by the American Pomological Society in its\r\ncatalog for 1899.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, very vigorous, spreading, open-topped, productive;\r\n    branches thorny, shaggy, with long and unbranched limbs;\r\n    branchlets willowy, slender; leaves folded upward, oval, one\r\n    and three-quarters inches wide, three and one-quarter inches\r\n    long, thin; margin shallowly crenate, with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole slender, pubescent, with from one to three small\r\n    glands; blooming season late, long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, nearly three-quarters inch across, white, pinkish as\r\n    they open, with a disagreeable odor; borne in twos or threes;\r\n    anthers yellow with an orange-red tinge.\r\n\r\n    Fruit maturing later than Wild Goose; large, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches by one and one-eighth inches in size,\r\n    obovate, slightly necked, pear-shaped, bright red, covered\r\n    with thin bloom; dots conspicuous; stem slender, long; flesh\r\n    deep yellow, juicy, coarse and fibrous, subacid, flat; of fair\r\n    quality; stone clinging, three-quarters inch by three-eighths\r\n    inch in size, somewhat angular, irregular-obovate, with a\r\n    peculiar elongated, flattened, oblique base; apex abruptly\r\n    acute; surfaces rough.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAULDING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPAULDING]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Lovett _Cat._ =41=, Col.

It is particularly highly spoken of for its good\r\nquality and while not recommended for commercial orchards is often\r\nmentioned as very desirable for home use. As Spaulding grows at this\r\nStation, it does not sustain the reputation it has elsewhere. It is of\r\nthe Reine Claude group of plums and while of high quality is not as good\r\na dessert plum as several other similar sorts. Moreover, the fruits are\r\nsmall and too light in color to be especially attractive in appearance.\r\nThe plums, too, are quite susceptible to brown-rot. The tree-characters\r\nof this variety are in the main very good but not at all out of the\r\nordinary. It is very doubtful whether this sort can compete for any\r\npurpose with such similar plums as Hand, Jefferson, Washington, Bavay,\r\nReine Claude, McLaughlin and Imperial Gage. It may be worthy a trial\r\nelsewhere in New York with the hope that it will more nearly approach the\r\nreputation that it has in other states than it does at Geneva—at best it\r\ncannot be more than a home variety.\r\n\r\nSpaulding was brought to the notice of fruit-growers by J. T. Lovett,\r\nLittle Silver, New Jersey, who introduced the variety in 1888. The\r\nplum came to Mr. Lovett from Francis Garriel with the statement that\r\nit originated as a seedling in the yard of Mr. Garriel’s father in the\r\nBowery, New York City. From the resemblance of Spaulding to the Imperial\r\nGage it is probable that they are closely related. In 1899 the variety\r\nwas placed on the fruit catalog list of the American Pomological Society\r\nas a successful variety in the north-eastern part of the United States\r\nand the neighboring parts of Canada.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, smooth except for the raised\r\n    lenticels of various sizes; branchlets of medium thickness\r\n    and length, with long internodes, greenish-red changing to\r\n    brownish-red, dull, lightly pubescent throughout the season,\r\n    with obscure, small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and\r\n    length, conical, appressed; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, nearly two inches wide, three and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n    rugose, glabrous, with a shallow groove on the midrib; lower\r\n    surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or\r\n    acute, base acute, margin serrate or crenate, with small,\r\n    dark glands; petiole nearly five-eighths inch long, thick,\r\n    pubescent, tinged red, with from one to four small, globose,\r\n    greenish glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length, one inch or\r\n    more across, white with a yellowish tinge at the apex of the\r\n    petals in the newly opened flowers; borne on lateral spurs,\r\n    singly or in pairs; pedicels three-eighths inch long, thick,\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, lightly\r\n    pubescent; calyx-lobes obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals oblong, crenate, not\r\n    clawed; anthers yellow; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil\r\n    glabrous or occasionally with a few hairs near the base, longer\r\n    than the stamens; stigma large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period long; one and five-eighths\r\n    inches by one and three-eighths inches in size, oblong-oval\r\n    or ovate, compressed, halves equal; cavity small, shallow,\r\n    abrupt; suture shallow, often a line; apex roundish; color\r\n    dull greenish-yellow, with stripes and splashes of light\r\n    green, overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, small,\r\n    whitish, inconspicuous; stem three-quarters inch long, lightly\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, tender,\r\n    separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, fibrous,\r\n    tender, sweet, mild, pleasant; very good; stone semi-free or\r\n    free, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size, ovate,\r\n    turgid, slightly pitted, blunt at the base, nearly acute at\r\n    the apex; ventral suture rather broad, slightly furrowed, with\r\n    a distinct but short wing; dorsal suture widely and deeply\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANTON\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Its faults are that it is tardy\r\nin coming into bearing and the fruits drop badly from the trees as they\r\nbegin to ripen; in localities where these faults are marked the variety\r\nis worthless. Stanton originated as a chance seedling in Albany County,\r\nNew York, from whence it was sent to Hammond and Willard of Geneva, New\r\nYork, who introduced it about 1885.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, round-topped, variable in\r\n    productiveness; branches slender, marked by transverse cracks\r\n    in the bark; leaf-scars enlarged; leaves folded upward, oval\r\n    or obovate, one and one-half inches wide, three inches long;\r\n    margin finely and doubly crenate, with few, dark glands;\r\n    petiole short, glandless or with from one to three small glands\r\n    usually on the stalk; blooming season intermediate in time and\r\n    length; flowers appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth\r\n    inches across, borne in scattering clusters on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season long; about one and one-quarter inches in\r\n    diameter, roundish-oblate, truncate, purplish-black, overspread\r\n    with very heavy bloom; flesh bright golden-yellow, fibrous,\r\n    very sweet, rather high-flavored; good to very good; stone\r\n    semi-free, three-quarters inch by five-eighths inch in size,\r\n    irregular roundish-oval, turgid, with a blunt and oblique base,\r\n    the surfaces nearly smooth; ventral suture enlarged, often with\r\n    a short, distinct wing; dorsal suture shallow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTODDARD\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

Stoddart 1, 2.\r\n\r\nStoddard is usually rated as one of the best of the Americana plums and\r\nits behavior on the grounds of this Station sustains its reputation.\r\nThe firmness of the fruit makes it a good shipping plum of its kind\r\nand season. This variety was discovered by B. F. Stoddard of Jesup,\r\nBuchanan County, Iowa, about 1875, growing in a garden owned by Mrs.\r\nCaroline Baker who stated that her husband secured the trees from the\r\nwoods, presumably along the Maquoketa River. The variety was subsequently\r\nintroduced by J. Wragg and Sons of Waukee, Iowa, at dates variously\r\nreported from 1890 to 1895.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, productive; trunk\r\n    shaggy; branches slender, thorny; branchlets slender, with\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaves falling early,\r\n    flattened, oval or obovate, two and one-quarter inches wide,\r\n    four inches long; margin coarsely serrate, eglandular; petiole\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to three glands usually\r\n    on the stalk; blooming season late; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves, one inch across, white.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; about\r\n    one and three-eighths inches in diameter, roundish-oblate;\r\n    suture a distinct red line; color light to dark red over\r\n    a yellow ground, mottled, covered with thick bloom; skin\r\n    astringent; flesh dark golden-yellow, very juicy, tender\r\n    and melting, rather sweet next the skin but tart near the\r\n    center, with a characteristic flavor; good; stone clinging,\r\n    seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size, roundish to\r\n    broad-oval, strongly flattened, with smooth surfaces; ventral\r\n    suture narrow, winged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONELESS\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Duhamel _Trait.

The variety is at least three hundred\r\nyears old. It was known to Merlet, writing in the Seventeenth Century,\r\nand has been mentioned in plum literature many times since. The plum is\r\nremarkable because of the entire absence of a stone, the kernel lying\r\nnaked in a cavity much larger than itself. The variety is worthless\r\nbut presents opportunities for breeding purposes that should not be\r\noverlooked. Judging from the fruit-characters as given below it belongs\r\nto _Prunus insititia_. The Stoneless is supposed to have been introduced\r\ninto England from the Royal Gardens at Versailles by George London. It\r\nwas long sold as Kirke’s Stoneless, having been much advertised by Kirke,\r\na nurseryman at Brompton, England. It is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    Fruit small, oval, dark purple, with thick bloom; flesh\r\n    greenish-yellow, harsh and strongly acid at first but assuming\r\n    a more pleasant flavor as it shrivels upon the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

Possibly our expectations were too high;\r\nfor we have been greatly disappointed in this plum as compared with its\r\nparent, Agen, as the two varieties grow at Geneva—it should be said at\r\nonce that neither grows nearly as well in New York as in California. The\r\nfruits of Sugar on the Station grounds are not larger than those of the\r\nAgen, while in California it is said to be twice or three times as large;\r\nthe flavor is not as pleasant and the flesh is fibrous in the offspring\r\nand not so in the parent at Geneva, though in California the Sugar is\r\nsaid to be of better quality than the Agen. As the two grow here, Sugar\r\nis rather more attractive in appearance and ripens earlier, the latter\r\ncharacter a distinct advantage since Agen is very late in New York. The\r\ntrees of the two plums are much alike though those of Agen are larger\r\nand more productive than those of Sugar as grown in New York. There are,\r\nhowever, but two trees of the latter variety on the Station grounds and\r\nthese are young, set in 1899, so that too much importance must not be\r\nattached to the comparison of the trees. Sugar is worth further trial in\r\nNew York under other conditions of soil and climate but it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether it will surpass the Agen in this State.\r\n\r\nThis plum, a seedling of the well-known Agen, was introduced by its\r\noriginator, Burbank, in 1899. The California Experiment Station in\r\nanalyzing this plum found it to be richer in sugar than the Agen and\r\nstates that it is larger and more easily dried. Sugar has become of great\r\ncommercial importance in the California prune districts and has been\r\ntop-grafted on other plums and even on almonds to the extent of hundreds\r\nof acres in that State and in Oregon. As yet it is only under trial in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, usually vigorous, spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    hardy, productive; branches ash-gray, tinged red, smooth except\r\n    for the numerous, small, raised lenticels; branchlets slender,\r\n    with long internodes, green changing to brownish-red, dull,\r\n    sparingly pubescent throughout the season, with numerous,\r\n    inconspicuous, small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, somewhat\r\n    pointed, strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate or oval, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, five inches long; upper surface dark green,\r\n    rugose, covered with numerous hairs, the midrib narrowly\r\n    grooved; lower surface pale green, overspread with thick\r\n    pubescence; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute,\r\n    margin serrate, with small dark glands; petiole nearly one\r\n    inch long, covered with thick pubescence, lightly tinged with\r\n    red, glandless or with from one to three small, globose,\r\n    greenish-yellow glands at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Flowers large, intermediate in time of bloom; calyx-tube green;\r\n    stamens longer than the pistil.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    small, ovate or oval, halves equal; cavity shallow, narrow,\r\n    abrupt; suture shallow, often a line; apex roundish or\r\n    pointed; color dark reddish-purple changing to purplish-black,\r\n    covered with thick bloom; dots numerous, small, light russet,\r\n    inconspicuous; stem slender, long, pubescent, adhering; skin\r\n    thin, tender, separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy,\r\n    coarse, fibrous, tender, sweet, mild; good to very good; stone\r\n    light colored, with a tinge of red, thin, of medium size,\r\n    ovate, flattened, with rough and pitted surfaces, blunt at\r\n    the base, acute at the apex; ventral suture rather narrow,\r\n    distinctly furrowed, slightly winged; dorsal suture with a\r\n    wide, deep groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURPRISE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURPRISE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana mineri?_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Wis.

The color is a\r\npeculiar red which serves to identify the variety; on the whole the\r\nfruits resemble the Americanas while the trees are rather more of the\r\nMiner type. The variety is productive in New York and is so spoken of in\r\nWisconsin by Goff,[224] but in Iowa it is said not to bear abundantly.\r\nIf a native plum is wanted in New York, this variety is worthy a trial.\r\n\r\nSurprise, according to the originator, Martin Penning of Sleepy Eye,\r\nBrown County, Minnesota, is the best of a thousand or more seedlings\r\ngrown from pits of De Soto, Weaver and Miner sown in 1882. In 1889,\r\nPenning introduced this plum and ten years later it was added to the\r\nfruit catalog list of the American Pomological Society. The parentage of\r\nthe variety is unknown but it has usually been thought that the botanical\r\ncharacters indicate that it is a seedling of Miner. As the tree grows\r\nhere, (they came to the Station from Mr. Penning,) it appears to be a\r\nhybrid of _Prunus americana_ and _Prunus hortulana mineri_, characters of\r\nboth species being evident.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk roughish; branches smooth, zigzag, thorny, dark\r\n    ash-gray, with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets slender,\r\n    medium to long, with long internodes, green changing to dark\r\n    chestnut-red, with brownish-gray scarf-skin, glossy, glabrous,\r\n    with numerous, conspicuous, small, raised lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    small, short, obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, oval or ovate, two inches\r\n    wide, four and one-half inches long, thin; upper surface\r\n    light green, glabrous, smooth, with a grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface pale green, lightly pubescent; apex taper-pointed, base\r\n    abrupt, margin often coarsely and doubly serrate, with amber\r\n    glands which are not persistent; petiole thirteen-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, slender, reddish, sparingly pubescent along one\r\n    side, glandless or with from one to five small, globose,\r\n    yellowish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, three-quarters inch across,\r\n    creamy-white, with a disagreeable odor; borne in clusters from\r\n    lateral buds, in threes or in fours; pedicels three-eighths\r\n    inch long, slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube greenish,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute, pubescent\r\n    on the inner surface, serrate and with reddish glands, erect;\r\n    petals roundish-ovate, entire, narrowly clawed; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous,\r\n    equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and three-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-eighth inches in size, halves equal;\r\n    cavity shallow, flaring; suture very shallow, distinct; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color dark red, covered with thin bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, medium to large, russet, conspicuous, clustered\r\n    about the apex; stem one-half inch long, glabrous, adhering to\r\n    the fruit; skin thick, tough, clinging; flesh golden-yellow,\r\n    juicy, fibrous, somewhat tender, sweet, insipid; quality fair;\r\n    stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval,\r\n    flattened, pointed at the base and apex, with smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNANT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TENNANT]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Bailey _Ann.

Tenant Prune 4.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that a variety of so much merit, especially of so\r\ngreat beauty, as Tennant, should not have been more widely tried in New\r\nYork. In the survey of plum culture in this State in the preparation of\r\nthe text for _The Plums of New York_, it could not be learned that the\r\nTennant had been tried in more than four or five places. In size and\r\nbeauty of form and coloring, all well shown in the illustration, Tennant\r\nhas few superiors in the collection of plums growing at this Station.\r\nWhile it is not sufficiently high in quality to be called a first-rate\r\ndessert fruit it is more palatable than most of the purple plums. It\r\nripens at a good time of the year, several days before the Italian Prune,\r\nand should, from the nature of its skin and the firmness of its flesh,\r\nboth ship and keep well. A fault of the fruit as it grows here, a fault\r\nnot ascribed to it elsewhere, is that it shrivels soon after ripening.\r\nOur trees are large, vigorous, healthy, hardy and productive—almost ideal\r\nplum-trees. This variety should be very generally tried in commercial\r\nplantations in New York and may well be planted in home collections for a\r\nculinary fruit at least. On the Pacific Coast it is cured for prunes, its\r\nmeaty flesh fitting it very well for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is another promising plum from the Pacific Northwest. Tennant\r\noriginated with Rev. John Tennant of Ferndale, Washington, and was\r\nintroduced in 1893 by McGill and McDonald, Salem, Oregon. The variety is\r\nfairly well known in the region of its origin but is practically unknown\r\nin New York. It was listed in the American Pomological Society catalog in\r\n1897 as successful in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, open, hardy, productive;\r\n    trunk slightly roughened; branches stocky, smooth, with\r\n    lenticels of medium number and size; branchlets thick, long,\r\n    with long internodes, greenish-red changing to brownish-drab,\r\n    with green patches and considerable scarf-skin, somewhat\r\n    glossy, sparingly pubescent throughout the season, with\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, pointed, appressed;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, oval or obovate, one and three-quarters\r\n    inches wide, three and one-half inches long, thick, stiff;\r\n    upper surface dark green, rugose, sparingly hairy, with a\r\n    grooved midrib; lower surface silvery-green, with thick\r\n    pubescence; apex abruptly pointed to acute, base acute, margin\r\n    crenate, eglandular or with small, brown glands; petiole\r\n    five-eighths inch long, thick, tinged red along one side,\r\n    hairy, glandless or with one or two rather large, globose,\r\n    brownish glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early to medium, short; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, one inch or more across, white, the buds tinged\r\n    yellow; borne on lateral spurs; pedicels one-half inch long,\r\n    thick, pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, often with a\r\n    swelling around the base, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces, with thick, marginal\r\n    hairs, erect; petals roundish-oval, entire, tapering to short,\r\n    broad claws; anthers large, yellow; filaments five-sixteenths\r\n    inch long; pistil pubescent at the base, equal to the stamens\r\n    in length; stigma large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season; one\r\n    and three-quarters inches by one and five-eighths inches in\r\n    size, roundish-truncate or roundish-oblong, with irregular\r\n    surface which is somewhat ridged, halves equal; cavity narrow,\r\n    abrupt, slightly compressed; suture variable in depth,\r\n    distinct; apex deeply depressed; color dark reddish-purple,\r\n    overspread with thick bloom; dots numerous, variable in size,\r\n    whitish, conspicuous, clustered about the apex; stem thick,\r\n    three-eighths inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin tough, adhering slightly to the pulp; flesh dark\r\n    golden-yellow, somewhat dry, coarse, tough, firm, sweet, mild\r\n    but pleasant; of good quality; stone clinging, seven-eighths\r\n    inch by five-eighths inch in size, irregular-oval, flattened,\r\n    obliquely necked, blunt at the apex, with deeply pitted\r\n    surfaces, roughish; ventral suture prominent, heavily furrowed,\r\n    not winged; dorsal suture usually with a narrow, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAGEDY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAGEDY]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cal.

It is an older plum than the Tennant and\r\nsomewhat better known in New York but still the reports of it are not\r\nsufficient in number or of great enough range to enable a fair opinion\r\nto be given as to its merits. As the variety grows at Geneva the fruits\r\nare very attractive in appearance—above medium size, a dark, rich\r\npurple color, and having the full, rounded form much liked by consumers\r\nin a dessert plum. The flesh is juicy, tender and sweet so that the\r\nquality may be called good; possibly the flesh is a little too soft for\r\nlong shipping or long keeping as it grows here, though in one of the\r\nCalifornia references it is spoken of as “valuable for eastern shipment.”\r\nThe trees are very satisfactory except that in New York they are not\r\nquite as reliable in bearing as could be wished. A fault, as the variety\r\ngrows here and which may be local, is that a large proportion of the pits\r\nare cracked and all are soft and granular. The tree is reported by some\r\nas “scale proof” but unfortunately this statement can neither be denied\r\nnor affirmed. A plum with the good qualities possessed by Tragedy, should\r\nbe better known in New York.\r\n\r\nThe following history is contributed by Professor E. J. Wickson,\r\nBerkeley, California. Tragedy originated as a chance seedling on the\r\nfarm of O. R. Runyon, near Courtland, Sacramento County, California,\r\nprobably in the late seventies. It was first offered to the trade in\r\ndormant buds by W. R. Strong and Company of Sacramento in 1887. Since\r\nthe German Prune and Duane Purple grew on the place of its origin and as\r\nit shows characters of both, it has been noted as a probable cross of\r\nthese varieties. The name Tragedy is understood to have been given to\r\nthe fruit by Mr. Runyon because the plum was noted to be desirable on or\r\nabout a day upon which a certain event held to be tragical occurred in\r\nthe neighborhood. In 1899, the American Pomological Society considered\r\nTragedy worthy a place in its list of fruits.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round-topped, hardy, variable in\r\n    productiveness; branches ash-gray, usually smooth, with raised\r\n    lenticels of various sizes; branchlets twiggy, thick, medium\r\n    to short, with short internodes, greenish-red changing to dark\r\n    brownish-drab, covered with thick pubescence, with obscure,\r\n    small lenticels; leaf-buds intermediate in size and length,\r\n    obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, oval or obovate, one and three-quarters\r\n    inches wide, three and three-quarters inches long; upper\r\n    surface dark green, glabrous except for the few hairs on the\r\n    deeply and narrowly grooved midrib; lower surface pubescent;\r\n    apex acute or obtuse, base acute; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, thick, pubescent, faintly tinged red, glandless or with\r\n    one or two small, globose, greenish-brown glands usually at the\r\n    base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early, short; flowers appearing with the\r\n    leaves, seven-eighths inch across, white; borne on lateral\r\n    buds, usually in pairs; pedicels one-half inch long, thick,\r\n    pubescent, greenish; calyx-tube green, with roughened surface,\r\n    campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, lightly pubescent,\r\n    serrate, with many glands and marginal hairs, reflexed; petals\r\n    broadly oval, crenate, short-clawed; anthers bright yellow;\r\n    filaments nearly five-sixteenths inch long; pistil pubescent at\r\n    the base, much longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short; one and five-eighths inches by\r\n    one and three-eighths inches in size, oval, swollen on the\r\n    suture side, compressed, halves unequal; cavity narrow,\r\n    abrupt, regular; suture shallow, often an indistinct line;\r\n    apex roundish; color dark purplish-black, covered with thick\r\n    bloom; dots numerous, variable in size, russet, inconspicuous;\r\n    stem five-eighths inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin of medium thickness and toughness, somewhat sour,\r\n    separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow, juicy, tender,\r\n    sweet, mild; good; stone clinging, one inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, irregular-oval, flattened, obliquely necked;\r\n    apex acute; surfaces pitted, roughish; ventral suture narrow,\r\n    prominent, not winged; dorsal suture narrowly and deeply\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENT\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Downing _Fr.

Transparent Gage\r\n    Plum 2, 5.\r\n\r\nIn Europe Transparent is considered one of the best of all dessert plums\r\nbut either it does not do as well in America or the American bred plums\r\nof the Reine Claude group, to which this variety belongs, are much better\r\non this continent than in the Old World. At any rate in our soil and\r\nclimate there are a dozen or more Reine Claude plums as good or better\r\nin quality than Transparent and much superior in other characters. It\r\nis, however, worth planting by the connoisseur for its quality and\r\nbecause of the transparency of skin—in the latter respect it is unique\r\namong Domestica plums. The flower-buds of this variety have a remarkable\r\ntendency to produce leaves in the place of floral organs.\r\n\r\nTransparent is an old French variety. M. Lafay, a rose-grower at\r\nBellevue, near Paris, raised it from the seed of the Reine Claude and\r\nnamed it Reine Claude Diaphane. It was grown previous to 1836, for,\r\nduring this year, Thomas Rivers of England, while visiting M. Lafay, was\r\ntold of its origin. In 1871, the American Pomological Society listed\r\nTransparent in its catalog as worthy of culture. The color of this\r\nvariety leads to the suspicion that Reine Claude is not the only parent.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches slender, ash-gray, roughish towards\r\n    the trunk, with small lenticels; branchlets above medium in\r\n    thickness, short, with internodes of average length, green\r\n    changing to brownish-red often retaining some green, dull,\r\n    pubescent, with small lenticels; leaf-buds of medium size and\r\n    length, conical, somewhat appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, obovate or oval, two and one-half inches\r\n    wide, five inches long, above average thickness; upper surface\r\n    rugose, nearly glabrous, with a grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin\r\n    often doubly serrate or crenate, with small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole seven-eighths inch long, thick, pubescent, faintly\r\n    tinged red, glandless or with from one to four rather large,\r\n    globose or oval, greenish-brown glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white; borne in\r\n    scattering clusters on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in\r\n    pairs; pedicels five-eighths inch long, thick, pubescent,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes\r\n    obtuse, lightly pubescent, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals\r\n    obovate, crenate, tapering to short, broad claws; anthers\r\n    yellow with a tinge of red; filaments three-eighths inch long;\r\n    pistil glabrous, shorter than the stamens, often in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, intermediate in length of ripening season; one\r\n    and three-eighths inches by one and one-half inches in size,\r\n    oblate, compressed; halves equal; cavity wide, flaring; suture\r\n    a line; apex flattened or depressed; color red over a dark\r\n    amber-yellow ground, mottled, covered with thin bloom; dots\r\n    numerous, grayish or light russet, conspicuous, decreasing in\r\n    number but increasing in size towards the cavity; stem thick,\r\n    three-quarters inch long, pubescent, adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, adhering but slightly; flesh golden-yellow,\r\n    juicy, fibrous, tender, very sweet, aromatic, pleasant; very\r\n    good to best; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by one-half\r\n    inch in size, roundish-oval, turgid, blunt at the base and\r\n    apex, with slightly pitted surfaces; ventral suture, wide,\r\n    blunt, faintly grooved; dorsal suture with a deep groove of\r\n    medium width.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNGARISH\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

Ungarish Prune 2, 7. _Quetsche de\r\n    Hongrie_ 1. _Zwetsche Ungarische_ 1.\r\n\r\nBudd’s Ungarish as grown at the New York State Experiment Station is\r\nnearly identical with the Italian Prune. The only differences to be\r\ndetected are that the Italian Prune is a trifle smaller, a little more\r\nfirm, not as broad and not quite as sweet as the Ungarish. The pit of the\r\nlatter is usually tinged with red, while that of the former is rarely\r\nso colored. If the Ungarish prove as productive as the Italian Prune it\r\nmay be more desirable because of its larger size. In 1883 Professor J.\r\nL. Budd of the Iowa Experiment Station imported trees under the name\r\nQuetsche de Hongrie or Zwetsche Ungarische from C. H. Wagner of Riga,\r\nRussia and from Wilhelm Wohler of Wilna, Russia. Budd disseminated the\r\nvariety as Hungary, a name soon changed to Hungarian Prune and later to\r\nUngarish. This is not to be confused with the true Hungarian so well\r\nknown in Europe as the Quetsche de Hongrie.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTAH\r\n\r\n_Prunus besseyi_ × _Prunus watsoni_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Dieck in Dippel _Laubholzkunde_ =3=:634. 1893. =2.=\r\n    _Cornell Sta.

Utah Hybrid 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\nThis interesting natural hybrid was grown by J. E. Johnson at Wood River,\r\nNebraska, some time previous to 1870. Mr. Johnson planted seed of the\r\nnative dwarf cherry which had grown near Sand plums and which supposedly\r\nhad been pollinized by the plums. The resulting plants proved to be\r\nintermediates between the cherry and the plum and are now generally\r\nthought to be natural hybrids. From these seedlings, one was selected and\r\npropagated. Shortly afterwards Mr. Johnson moved to Utah taking his new\r\nhybrid with him and from there distributed it as Utah. In 1893 a German\r\nbotanist, Dieck (References, 1), described this hybrid and gave it the\r\nspecific name _Prunus utahensis_. The plant has no commercial value. It\r\nis described as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tree a dwarfish tree-like bush three or four feet in height;\r\n    branches and branchlets zigzag after the habit of _Prunus\r\n    watsoni_: leaves small, narrow-ovate, pointed at the ends;\r\n    margins crenulate, glandless, sometimes small glands on the\r\n    petioles; fruit early, small, round, dark mahogany-red, covered\r\n    with bloom; skin very bitter; flesh melting; pleasant flavor;\r\n    quality poor; stone small, round like that of a cherry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Lond.

It is a large plum attaining nearly\r\nthe size of Pond, though the color-plate does not so show it, and has\r\nmuch the same color as the plum with which we have just compared it.\r\nHere resemblances cease for Victoria is not the same shape as Pond,\r\nis a little better in quality, is earlier and quite different in\r\ntree-characters. It would seem that this would make a good market plum as\r\nit is firm enough in flesh to ship well, as grown here keeps remarkably\r\nwell, is better in quality than the average market plum and is handsome,\r\nthough Americans seem to care little for red plums, preferring the yellow\r\nsorts and still more the purple kinds. Unfortunately, Victoria does not\r\nalways color well in our climate. The trees of this variety at this\r\nStation, while productive, are not large nor robust, and the foliage is\r\na little too susceptible to fungi. These defects of the tree may account\r\nfor the lack of popularity of the variety in New York though even if they\r\nare to be found in all localities, which is probably not the case, this\r\nplum is still worth growing to some extent for home or market.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this plum and even its right to the name under which it\r\nis discussed here are matters of controversy. The London Horticultural\r\nSociety in 1831 mentioned La Victorine in its catalog but since no\r\ndescription was given it cannot be identified as Victoria. Sharp’s\r\nEmperor which has been confused with this variety, was described in\r\nthe same publication. These two varieties were considered as identical\r\nby Charles Downing, Hogg, Mas and others; while Royer[225] who tested\r\nSharp’s Emperor, obtained from Liegel, thought it to be distinct, as did\r\nThomas, the _Guide Pratique_ and Pearson of England. Hogg in describing\r\nthe Victoria says, “This is a Sussex plum, and was discovered in a\r\ngarden at Alderton in that county. It became known as Sharp’s Emperor,\r\nand was ultimately sold by a nurseryman named Denyer, in the year 1844 at\r\nBrixton, near London, at a high price as a new variety under the name of\r\nDenyer’s Victoria.” Pearson in the _Journal of the Royal Horticultural\r\nSociety_ for 1897 says the reason that Hogg and other authorities had\r\ncalled these varieties identical is that they had not seen the true\r\nvariety. At this Station we have not seen Sharp’s Emperor but judging\r\nfrom the descriptions it is distinct though very similar. The American\r\nPomological Society placed Victoria on its fruit list in 1862 but in\r\n1871, Sharp’s Emperor was substituted as the correct name with Victoria\r\nas a synonym. This change was probably made to comply with Downing’s\r\nnomenclature of 1869. A review of the whole controversy cannot but lead\r\nto the conclusion that Victoria is the correct name and it appears also\r\nto be in most common use.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, hardy,\r\n    productive; branches ash-gray, smooth, with few large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets thick, short, stout, with short\r\n    internodes, greenish changing to dark brownish-drab, dull, with\r\n    thick pubescence, with few inconspicuous, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds large, long, conical or pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded backward, obovate, two and three-eighths inches\r\n    wide, five inches long, thick, stiff; upper surface dark green,\r\n    rugose, with a narrow groove on the midrib, sparingly hairy;\r\n    lower surface medium green, thickly pubescent; apex abruptly\r\n    pointed, base cuneate, margin serrate or crenate, eglandular\r\n    or with small dark glands; petiole one inch long, covered with\r\n    thick pubescence, tinged red on one side, glandless or with\r\n    from one to three globose or reniform, yellow glands usually on\r\n    the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Season of bloom medium, short; flowers appearing with\r\n    the leaves, one and one-eighth inches across, white, the\r\n    buds tinged yellow; borne in clusters on lateral buds and\r\n    spurs, singly or in pairs; pedicels nearly three-eighths\r\n    inch long, thick, heavily pubescent; calyx-tube green,\r\n    campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes medium to narrow, obtuse,\r\n    glandular-serrate, thickly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    reflexed; petals roundish-obovate, entire or occasionally\r\n    notched, tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period of medium length; one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches by one and one-half inches in size,\r\n    long-oval, oblong, compressed, halves equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, flaring; suture variable in depth, prominent; apex\r\n    roundish or depressed; color dark red, mottled before full\r\n    maturity, covered with thick bloom; dots numerous, russet,\r\n    conspicuous; stem thick, three-quarters inch long, very\r\n    pubescent, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin thin, tender,\r\n    adhering but slightly; flesh light yellow, juicy, coarse, firm,\r\n    sweet, mild but pleasant; good; stone free, one and one-eighth\r\n    inches by three-eighths inch in size, broad-oval, strongly\r\n    flattened, deeply pitted, roughish, blunt at the base and apex;\r\n    ventral suture narrow, distinctly winged; dorsal suture widely\r\n    and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET DIAPER\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

It is\r\nperfectly hardy at Geneva, the trees are also very productive and the\r\nfruits are attractive enough in size and color to meet market demands but\r\nthe flavor is so insipid as to make the plum unfit for dessert and hardly\r\nfit for kitchen use. It is given the honor of a color-plate because it is\r\na somewhat distinct type. In 1881 Professor J. L. Budd secured from J.\r\nE. Fisher, Voronesh, Russia, a variety which he introduced as Voronesh\r\nYellow. At the same time he imported a variety from Fisher under the name\r\nMoldavka which proved to be identical with his Voronesh Yellow, though\r\nBudd held that while they were very similar the Moldavka was more oval\r\nthan Voronesh.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size, round-topped, productive; leaves drooping,\r\n    folded backward, narrow-obovate, two and one-quarter inches\r\n    wide, four and one-half inches long, thick; margin doubly\r\n    serrate, with small, yellowish glands; petiole one-half inch\r\n    long, tinged red, pubescent, sometimes with two globose,\r\n    yellowish-red glands usually on the stalk near the base of the\r\n    leaf; blooming season early, short; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, fully one and one-eighth inches across, dull white;\r\n    borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and seven-eighths\r\n    inches by one and one-half inches in size, ovate, necked,\r\n    slightly enlarged on the suture side, dark lemon-yellow,\r\n    with thin bloom; dots very numerous, of medium size, white,\r\n    conspicuous; stem adhering strongly to the fruit; skin tough,\r\n    sour; flesh dark amber-yellow, very tender, sweet, mild; poor;\r\n    stone free, one and three-eighths inches by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, long-oval, flattened, somewhat necked, acute at the\r\n    apex, the surfaces smooth or partially honeycombed; ventral\r\n    suture prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALES\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Prune Prince of Whales 6.\r\n\r\nWales, more commonly known as the Prince of Wales, seems to have much\r\nmerit yet it has long been grown in America, probably three-quarters of\r\na century, without attaining distinction with fruit-growers. In recent\r\nyears it has been favorably commented upon in a number of publications\r\nand seems to be better known and more grown than formerly. Whether this\r\ntardily-given recognition is not too late is a question. So many good\r\nplums have been introduced both at home and abroad in the last few\r\ndecades that a sort dating back nearly a century must be meritorious,\r\nindeed, to stand the competition. As Wales grows in New York, it is\r\nrather too poor in quality to recommend it for a home variety and the\r\nplums are too small, as they generally grow, for a good commercial fruit.\r\nThe trees are enormously productive and are very satisfactory in other\r\ncharacters as well. In a bulletin from the Cornell Station (References,\r\n13) this variety is said to have “much to commend it for general favor:”\r\nwhile in Ohio (References, 15) it is thought that Wales “ought to become\r\npopular.”\r\n\r\nWales, a seedling of Orleans, was raised by a Mr. Chapman, Brentford,\r\nMiddlesex, England, in 1830. It was exhibited before the London\r\nHorticultural Society in 1845 where it was awarded a prize. The following\r\nyear, Hovey, the American pomologist, (References, 2) described the\r\nvariety but the date of the first importation to this country is unknown.\r\nIt was not until 1897 that the variety was sufficiently known to be\r\nplaced on the fruit catalog list of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, slightly vasiform, open-topped, hardy,\r\n    very productive; branches ash-gray, smooth except for the\r\n    numerous, small, slightly raised lenticels, often marked\r\n    by concentric rings; branchlets of medium thickness and\r\n    length, with long internodes, green changing to brownish-red,\r\n    dull, thinly pubescent, with numerous, inconspicuous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds large, long, conical or pointed;\r\n    leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, roundish-ovate or oval, two and one-half\r\n    inches wide, three and one-half inches long; upper surface\r\n    dark green, somewhat rugose, covered with numerous hairs;\r\n    lower surface pale green, thickly pubescent; apex and base\r\n    abrupt, margin crenate, eglandular or with small dark glands;\r\n    petiole one-half inch long, pubescent, tinged red, glandless or\r\n    with from one to three small, globose, yellowish-brown glands\r\n    usually at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers one inch across, white,\r\n    with a yellow tinge; usually borne in pairs; pedicels\r\n    eleven-sixteenths inch long, thick, pubescent, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, campanulate, lightly pubescent toward the\r\n    base; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, erect; petals\r\n    broadly oval, crenate, tapering to short, blunt claws;\r\n    filaments five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous except on\r\n    the ovary, longer than the stamens; stigma large.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; one and five-eighths inches by one\r\n    and one-half inches in size, roundish-oval, halves equal;\r\n    cavity narrow, abrupt; suture a line; apex roundish; color\r\n    reddish-purple, overspread with thick bloom; dots few, large,\r\n    often tinged red, conspicuous; stem thick, one-half inch long,\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin tough, separating\r\n    readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, tender, sweet, mild; good;\r\n    stone semi-free or free, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths\r\n    inch in size, oval, turgid, blunt at the base and apex, with\r\n    slightly pitted surfaces; ventral suture narrow, often acute or\r\n    with a slight wing; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANGENHEIM\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Cultivator_ =8=:26 fig. 1860. =2.= Mas _Le Verger_\r\n    =6=:157, fig. 79. 1866-73. =3.= _Am.

The fruits are large in size for one\r\nof this group; handsome in form and color (in the latter respect the\r\ncolor-plate does not do the variety justice); abundant in juice yet firm\r\nand meaty enough in flesh to keep and ship well; fine in flavor though\r\nnot quite equalling some others of its group in this character. The trees\r\nare large, hardy, vigorous and healthy, remarkable for their broad,\r\nglossy, abundant leaves, bear bountiful crops annually and at a favorable\r\nperiod of maturity. Washington thus has a combination of characters\r\nwhich few of its group, with which only it must be compared, possess.\r\nThe variety, however, is not without defects; the fruits are subject to\r\nbrown-rot, so much so that its value as a commercial variety is greatly\r\nlessened; the quality varies greatly in different locations and even in\r\ndifferent years,—the latter very noticeable on the Station grounds; the\r\ntrees are slow in coming in bearing and the crops are small for some\r\nyears after fruiting begins. From the above considerations it may be\r\nseen that while this variety is almost always worth planting in a home\r\ncollection, the location for it as a commercial fruit needs to be chosen\r\nwith some care.\r\n\r\nThere are two accounts of the origin of this variety. William Prince\r\ngives its history as follows (References, 1): “It has always been\r\nthe custom at the establishment of the author, at Flushing, to plant\r\nannually the seeds of the finest fruits, for the purpose of originating\r\nnew varieties; and, about the year 1790, his father planted the pits of\r\ntwenty-five quarts of the Green Gage plum; these produced trees yielding\r\nfruit of every colour; and the White Gage, Red Gage, and Prince’s Gage,\r\nnow so well known, form part of the progeny of those plums; and there\r\nseems strong presumptive evidence to suppose that the Washington Plum was\r\none of the same collection.” Michael Floy gives a different history of\r\nthe Washington (References, 5). He states that he received the variety in\r\n1818 from a Mr. Bolmar of New York who in turn had purchased his trees\r\nfrom a market woman in 1814. The purchased trees were produced as suckers\r\nfrom the roots of a Reine Claude tree which had been killed below the\r\ngraft by lightning on the Delancey farm, now the Bowery, in New York\r\nCity. In 1819, a few of the trees, budded the previous year by Floy, were\r\nsent to England. The American Pomological Society added the Washington to\r\nits fruit catalog list in 1852. Taking in consideration the evidence of\r\nother writers and further facts offered in other accounts by the Princes,\r\nfather and son, it seems almost certain that the first history is correct\r\nand that Bolmar’s trees had their origin in the Prince nursery.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, round and open-topped, hardy, very\r\n    productive; branches dark ash-gray, rough becoming shaggy on\r\n    the trunk, with small lenticels; branchlets below medium in\r\n    thickness and length, with long internodes, green changing\r\n    to brownish-red, thinly pubescent, with small lenticels of\r\n    average number; leaf-buds of medium size and length, pointed,\r\n    free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, oval, two and one-half inches wide, four and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, leathery, somewhat velvety; upper\r\n    surface dark green, lightly pubescent, with a shallow groove\r\n    on the midrib; lower surface medium green, thickly pubescent;\r\n    apex abruptly pointed or acute, base abrupt; margin serrate,\r\n    eglandular; petiole five-eighths inch long, green, pubescent,\r\n    glandless or with one or two smallish, globose, greenish-yellow\r\n    glands at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and five-sixteenths inches\r\n    across, white, with yellow near the apex; borne on lateral buds\r\n    and spurs; pedicels three-eighths inch long, thick, covered\r\n    with fine pubescence, greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate,\r\n    pubescent; calyx-lobes broad, obtuse, pubescent on both\r\n    surfaces, glandular-serrate and with marginal hairs, erect;\r\n    petals broad-ovate or oval, crenate, tapering into short, broad\r\n    claws; anthers yellow; filaments three-eighths inch long;\r\n    pistil glabrous, longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit intermediate in time and length of ripening season;\r\n    one and three-quarters inches by one and five-eighths inches\r\n    in size, roundish-oval, compressed, halves equal; cavity\r\n    shallow, narrow, flaring; suture shallow; apex roundish;\r\n    color greenish-yellow or light yellow, with green stripes and\r\n    splashes, occasionally with a faint blush on the sunny side,\r\n    covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, white, inconspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the apex; stem one-half inch long, covered\r\n    with thick pubescence, adhering strongly to the fruit; skin\r\n    thin, slightly sour, separating readily; flesh greenish-yellow,\r\n    juicy, firm but tender, sweet, mild, pleasant flavor; good to\r\n    very good; stone free, not filling the cavity, one inch by\r\n    three-quarters inch in size, oval, turgid, roughened, somewhat\r\n    blunt at the base and apex; ventral suture wide, marked by deep\r\n    furrows, with a distinct but short wing; dorsal suture widely\r\n    and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYLAND\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAYLAND]\r\n\r\n_Prunus hortulana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _U.

The trees withstand the\r\nhot, dry weather in the region south of central Iowa and Nebraska rather\r\nbetter than do those of varieties of other species and its fruits are\r\nborne in such quantities and so late that this and its kindred sorts\r\nbecome important plums. The fruits are quite too firm of flesh, too\r\nsour and too small to be of value for dessert purposes but they are\r\nmost excellent for jellies, marmalades and preserves—any of the uses\r\nto which the Damsons are commonly put. They are, too, best adapted for\r\nlong-keeping and shipping of any of the native plums. Except in size, the\r\nplums are hardly surpassed in the characters that make a fruit handsome\r\namong the native plums. The trees are large, robust and hardy in central\r\nNew York, usually free from attacks of insects and fungi and, with their\r\nabundant, glossy foliage, are strikingly ornamental. Wayland is of value\r\nfor New York, however, when all characters are considered, only in\r\nfurnishing variety, in extending the season for native plums and as an\r\nornamental.\r\n\r\nWayland was found in a plum thicket on the premises of Professor H. B.\r\nWayland, Cadiz, Kentucky. It was sent by him about 1875 to J. S. Downer\r\nand Sons, Fairview, Todd County, Kentucky, who named and introduced\r\nit. There has been much discussion as to the botanical status of this\r\nvariety, various writers having put it in at least three distinct species\r\nand Waugh and Bailey have used it as the type of the Wayland group of\r\n_Prunus hortulana_.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, spreading, somewhat drooping,\r\n    flat-topped, open, hardy at Geneva, productive; trunk shaggy;\r\n    branches rough, dark ash-gray, with inconspicuous lenticels,\r\n    medium in number and size; branchlets slender, twiggy, long,\r\n    with internodes of average length, green, changing to light\r\n    chestnut-red, glossy, glabrous, with numerous, conspicuous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds very small, short, obtuse,\r\n    plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, ovate or long-oval, peach-like, one and\r\n    seven-eighths inches across, five inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface smooth and glossy, with a grooved midrib; lower surface\r\n    sparingly pubescent; apex acuminate, base abrupt, margin\r\n    unevenly serrate, glandular; petiole one inch long, slender,\r\n    pubescent along one side, with a tinge of red, with from one to\r\n    five very small, globose, brownish glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after\r\n    the leaves, thirteen-sixteenths inch across, white, with\r\n    disagreeable odor; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs,\r\n    in threes, fours or fives; pedicels fifteen-sixteenths inch\r\n    long, very slender, glabrous, green; calyx-tube greenish,\r\n    narrowly campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute,\r\n    erect, lightly pubescent within, serrate and with dark-colored\r\n    glands; petals ovate or oval, irregularly crenate, tapering\r\n    into long, narrow claws with hairy margins; anthers yellowish;\r\n    filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil glabrous, shorter\r\n    than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season long; one and one-eighth inches by one\r\n    inch in size, roundish-ovate narrowing somewhat toward the\r\n    stem, conical, slightly compressed, halves equal; cavity medium\r\n    to deep, narrow, abrupt; suture usually very shallow and wide,\r\n    often a distinct line; apex pointed; color dark currant-red,\r\n    with inconspicuous, thin bloom; dots numerous, small to\r\n    medium, conspicuous, densely clustered about the apex; stem\r\n    very slender, five-eighths inch long, glabrous, not adhering\r\n    to the fruit; skin thick, tough, clinging but slightly; flesh\r\n    attractive light yellow; moderately juicy, coarse, fibrous,\r\n    rather tender, mildly sweet next the skin but astringent\r\n    towards the pit; fair to good; stone clinging, five-eighths\r\n    inch by three-eighths inch in size, long-oval, somewhat\r\n    elongated at the base and apex, turgid, with rough and pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture wide, blunt, faintly ridged; dorsal\r\n    suture acute, with a narrow, indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAVER\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Mich.

It is\r\nstill listed by many nurserymen and is widely distributed throughout\r\nthe country but it is now rapidly passing out of cultivation, being\r\nsuperseded by sorts producing larger and better colored fruits.\r\n\r\nThis variety was found growing wild on the Cedar River, in Iowa, by a Mr.\r\nWeaver. In 1873, Ennis and Patten, Charles City, Iowa, began its sale to\r\nfruit-growers. The American Pomological Society placed the Weaver on its\r\nfruit catalog list in 1883, dropped it in 1891, and replaced it in 1897.\r\nThe following description is partly compiled.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, well formed, upright-spreading, unusually\r\n    hardy, productive; branches long, slender; branchlets slender,\r\n    long, with short internodes, reddish-brown, glabrous, with\r\n    numerous, conspicuous lenticels of medium size; leaf-buds\r\n    small, conical, of average length.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling late, four and one-half inches long, two and\r\n    one-half inches wide, obovate or oval, firm, thick, leathery;\r\n    upper surface dark green, slightly roughened, glabrous, with\r\n    narrow midrib; lower surface pale green, pubescent on the\r\n    midrib and larger veins; apex acuminate, base somewhat acute,\r\n    margin deeply and coarsely serrate; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, stout, reddish, slightly pubescent along one side,\r\n    usually with two large, globose, reddish-brown glands on the\r\n    stem.\r\n\r\n    Flowers large, prominently stalked; calyx-lobes conspicuously\r\n    glandular, lightly pubescent within.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season or later; one inch by three-quarters inch in\r\n    size, large for a native, oval or roundish-oblong, compressed,\r\n    halves unequal; cavity medium to shallow, narrow, rather\r\n    abrupt; suture shallow, distinct; apex roundish or depressed;\r\n    color not uniform, yellowish overlaid with purplish-red,\r\n    mottled, covered with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, often\r\n    purplish, inconspicuous; skin thick, very tough, astringent,\r\n    adhering to the pulp; flesh deep yellow, juicy, firm and\r\n    meaty, sweet, mild; fair to good; stone variable in adhesion,\r\n    three-quarters inch by three-eighths inch in size, long and\r\n    narrow, somewhat oval, flattened, obscurely pointed at the base\r\n    and apex, smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BULLACE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE BULLACE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

It was cultivated more than\r\nthree hundred years ago for Parkinson described it as common in his\r\ntime. He says of it “The White and the blacke Bulleis are common in most\r\nCountries, being small round, lesser than Damsons, sharper in taste, and\r\nlater ripe.” It is probably one of the first of the cultivated plums.\r\nWhite Bullace is illustrated and described in full in _The Plums of\r\nNew York_ chiefly as a means of comparison between the plums of three\r\ncenturies ago and those of the present. It has little value now for any\r\npurpose, though the Europeans still grow it rather commonly and from\r\nseeds, cions or suckers as convenience may dictate.\r\n\r\n    Tree of medium size and vigor, upright-spreading, dense-topped,\r\n    hardy, unproductive; branches ash-gray, nearly smooth, with\r\n    numerous, small, inconspicuous lenticels; branchlets thick,\r\n    above medium in length, with short internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dark brownish-red, dull, with thick pubescence\r\n    throughout the season, with few, small lenticels; leaf-buds\r\n    small, short, stubby, obtuse, strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened, obovate, one and five-eighths inches wide,\r\n    two and three-eighths inches long, thick; upper surface dark\r\n    green, rugose, with few hairs along the narrow, grooved midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery green, pubescent; apex abruptly pointed\r\n    or acute, base acute, margin doubly serrate, eglandular;\r\n    petiole one-half inch long, green, pubescent, glandless or with\r\n    one or two small, globose, greenish-yellow glands variable in\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, three-quarters inch across, white,\r\n    scattered on lateral spurs; usually borne singly; pedicels\r\n    one-quarter inch long, thick, densely covered with short\r\n    hairs, green; calyx-tube reddish-green, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes acute, lightly pubescent on both surfaces,\r\n    glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals obovate, entire, with\r\n    short, broad claws; anthers yellow with red tinge; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, nearly equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripening season of medium length; about one inch in\r\n    diameter, roundish, compressed, truncate at the base; cavity\r\n    rather deep and wide, abrupt; suture a line; apex flattened or\r\n    depressed; color deep amber-yellow, sometimes with faint pink\r\n    blush on the exposed cheek, overspread with moderately thick\r\n    bloom; dots numerous, white, inconspicuous; stem one-half inch\r\n    long, covered with scant pubescence, adhering strongly to the\r\n    fruit; skin thin, astringent, slightly adhering; flesh deep\r\n    golden-yellow, juicy, coarse, fibrous, firm, sour; poor in\r\n    quality; stone clinging, five-eighths inch by one-half inch\r\n    in size, ovate, turgid, blunt at the base, acute at the apex,\r\n    slightly roughened; ventral suture broad, blunt, shallowly\r\n    furrowed; dorsal suture with a wide, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE DAMSON\r\n\r\n_Prunus insititia_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Parkinson _Par.

Downing thought this a very desirable\r\naddition to our list of plums but nearly all other pomologists who have\r\nseen the fruit of the variety think it of small importance. Unfortunately\r\nit is not in the collection at this Station and can be neither\r\nrecommended nor condemned from first hand knowledge. This plum was first\r\nnoted in America by M’Mahon in 1806, and fifty years later it was added\r\nto the American Pomological Society list of promising varieties. For\r\nsome reason, perhaps for its color, it has never become so well known as\r\nthe purple Damsons. Perhaps from the division of _Prunus insititia_ made\r\nin _The Plums of New York_, this variety should be known as a Mirabelle\r\nrather than as a Damson. The following description is a compilation:\r\n\r\n    Tree vigorous, very productive; branches long, slender. Fruit\r\n    matures the last of September, season long; small, oval, pale\r\n    yellow sprinkled with reddish-brown dots, covered with thin\r\n    bloom; flesh yellowish, sprightly, pleasant flavored; good to\r\n    very good; stone clinging.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE IMPERATRICE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Kraft _Pom.

Because of its use for this purpose, it has been\r\nbadly confused with a similar variety, the Brignole, which derived its\r\nname from the town of Brignoles, where it was first grown. The variety\r\nis probably not known in America and might be worth introducing.

Perfection 1, 2. _Perfection_ 4, 14.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the value of Wickson in American pomology.\r\nProbably no plum of recent introduction has been on the one hand so\r\nhighly lauded and on the other so condemned as this one. Its remarkable\r\nsize, the largest of the Oriental plums if not the largest of all plums;\r\nits handsome color and distinct form; the firm flesh and peculiar flavor,\r\ngenerally considered pleasant; the narrow upright tree with its long\r\nlanceolate leaves, mark the variety as a new and for some parts of the\r\ncountry a valuable addition to pomology. The contradictory evidence\r\nas to its desirability arises from the fact that it can be well grown\r\nin comparatively few plum-growing regions, most of these being on the\r\nPacific Coast and in the South. In New York, the Wickson has small value\r\nother than in private collections. The variety is a little tender in tree\r\nand bud, hardy only in favored parts of this State and not at all where\r\nthe peach cannot be grown; it blooms too early to be safe from frost; it\r\nis susceptible to brown-rot; the trees are late in coming in bearing and\r\nare not reliable in fruiting; the fruits ripen unevenly; and the trees\r\nare not of good form for heavy crops. In California, however, the Wickson\r\nis one of the leading Japanese sorts, possibly the leading one, and is\r\nseemingly growing in favor. Starnes, one of the pomological authorities\r\nof the South, in his bulletin on _Japan and Hybrid Plums_, speaks of\r\nWickson as a “grand plum” and as one of the best for Georgia. It is to be\r\nhoped that from the same cross which produced Wickson or from breeding\r\nthis variety with some other, a plum of this type well suited to New York\r\nmay sometime be offered the plum-growers of this State.\r\n\r\nWickson is one of the best known of Burbank’s many plums. The variety was\r\nfirst described in the report of the Secretary of Agriculture in 1892\r\nunder the name Perfection and as a seedling of Kelsey crossed by Burbank.\r\nIn 1893 and 1894 Burbank offered for sale the control and the stock of\r\nthis variety but found no buyers and in 1895 introduced it himself.\r\nThe parentage of the variety is in doubt. Burbank considered it a\r\nKelsey-Burbank cross; the _Pacific Rural Press_ described it as offspring\r\nof Kelsey and Satsuma; Bailey, Waugh and the workers at this Station\r\nbelieve it to have _Prunus simonii_ characters. The foliage, flowers, the\r\ntree, the fruiting habit, the texture of the flesh, all indicate Simon\r\nas one of its parents. According to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nCalifornia State Board of Horticulture shipments of this plum were made\r\nto New York in the season of 1897 under the name of Eureka. In 1899 it\r\nwas placed on the fruit catalog list of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, with narrow, upright head,\r\n    dense-topped, tender to cold, an uncertain bearer; branches\r\n    medium in smoothness, the fruit-spurs numerous, dark ash-gray\r\n    with tinge of brown, with lenticels of medium size; branchlets\r\n    thick and long, with short internodes, greenish-red changing to\r\n    light chocolate-brown, glossy, glabrous; lenticels numerous,\r\n    raised, variable in size; leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, lanceolate or oblanceolate, one inch\r\n    wide, three inches long, thin; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, glabrous, with a slightly grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface pale green, glabrous, except along the midrib; apex\r\n    taper-pointed, base cuneate, margin finely serrate, with\r\n    reddish glands; petiole three-eighths inch long, lightly\r\n    pubescent along one side, faintly tinged red, glandless or with\r\n    from one to nine small, reniform, greenish or yellow glands\r\n    variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season early and of medium length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, intermediate in size, white;\r\n    borne in clusters on lateral spurs, in pairs or in threes;\r\n    pedicels of medium length and thickness, glabrous, greenish;\r\n    calyx-tube green, obconic, glabrous; calyx-lobes acute, erect,\r\n    glandular-ciliate; petals oval, entire, short-clawed; anthers\r\n    yellowish; filaments below medium in length; pistil glabrous,\r\n    longer than the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, period of ripening long; variable in\r\n    size, the larger fruits about two and one-eighth inches in\r\n    diameter, obliquely cordate, halves unequal; cavity deep,\r\n    abrupt, with yellowish concentric rings; suture often prominent\r\n    and deep, with a prolonged tip at the apex; color dark red over\r\n    a yellow ground, indistinctly splashed with darker red, mottled\r\n    with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, yellow, inconspicuous,\r\n    densely clustered about the apex; stem thick, eleven-sixteenths\r\n    inch long, glabrous; skin thin, tender, separating easily;\r\n    flesh amber-yellow, juicy, coarse, somewhat fibrous, firm,\r\n    sweet, pleasant but not high in flavor; good; stone clinging,\r\n    one inch by five-eighths inch in size, oval or ovate, pointed,\r\n    with pitted surfaces; ventral suture winged; dorsal suture\r\n    grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD GOOSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD GOOSE]\r\n\r\n_Prunus munsoniana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Gard.

Suwanee ?16.\r\n\r\nWild Goose is the first of the native plums to be generally grown as a\r\ndistinct variety though Miner was first known and named. Wild Goose, too,\r\nis probably a parent of more sorts than any other variety of the several\r\ncultivated native species, most of its offspring so strongly resembling\r\nit that its name has been given to a group of its closely related sorts.\r\nIn spite of the great number of native plums that have been introduced in\r\nrecent years, Wild Goose is still a favorite—probably more trees of it\r\nare now cultivated than of any other native plum. Its good qualities are:\r\nbright attractive color; tender and melting flesh with a sprightly and\r\nrefreshing flavor; a tough skin which fits the variety well for shipment\r\nand long-keeping; comparative freedom from brown-rot and curculio and\r\na large, hardy, healthy and, when cross-pollinated, a very productive\r\ntree. Wild Goose has been more extensively planted in New York than any\r\nother plum of its kind and in a few cases has proved a fairly profitable\r\ncommercial sort. It is doubtful if it is now the best of its species for\r\nthis State but it can at least be recommended for home plantings and in\r\nsome localities as a market plum. Wherever planted there should be some\r\nother native sort blooming at the same time for cross-pollination.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the origin of this variety, more romantic than\r\ncredible, is told with several variations. About 1820, M. E. McCance,\r\nwho lived near Nashville, Tennessee, shot a wild goose on his farm;\r\nhis wife, in dressing the goose, found a plum seed in the craw, which,\r\nplanted in the garden, produced the Wild Goose tree. The merits of\r\nthe new fruit seem to have been discovered by J. S. Downer, Fairview,\r\nKentucky, and James Harvey of Columbia, Tennessee. The former propagated,\r\nnamed and began the dissemination of Wild Goose to fruit-growers. Many\r\nvarieties have been sent out for this plum and much confusion has arisen\r\nas to what the true variety is. Since the characters of Wild Goose,\r\neven when cross-pollinated, are transmitted to its offspring to a\r\nremarkable degree, the name now applies to a class of plums rather than\r\nto a variety. The American Pomological Society placed this variety on\r\nthe fruit catalog list of the Society in 1875, dropped it in 1891, and\r\nreplaced it in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, wide-spreading, flat-topped,\r\n    hardy in New York, productive; branches rough and shaggy, dark\r\n    ash-gray, with numerous, large, elongated lenticels; branchlets\r\n    slender, long, with internodes of medium length, greenish-red\r\n    changing to dull reddish-brown, glossy, glabrous, with many,\r\n    conspicuous, large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds small, short,\r\n    obtuse, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, lanceolate, peach-like, four and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, one and one-half inches wide, thin;\r\n    upper surface light or dark green changing to reddish late in\r\n    the season, smooth, glabrous, with a grooved midrib; lower\r\n    surface pale green, glabrous except along the midrib and larger\r\n    veins; apex taper-pointed, base abrupt, margin finely serrate,\r\n    with small, reddish-black glands; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, slender, pubescent along one side, tinged red, glandless\r\n    or with from one to six globose, yellow or reddish-brown glands\r\n    on the stalk and base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, three-quarters inch across, white, with disagreeable\r\n    odor; borne in clusters on lateral buds and spurs, in threes\r\n    or fours; pedicels five-eighths inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    green; calyx-tube greenish, narrowly campanulate; calyx-lobes\r\n    narrow, glabrous on the outer surface, lightly pubescent\r\n    within, entire, heavily pubescent and with reddish glands on\r\n    the margin, erect; petals ovate, entire, long and narrowly\r\n    clawed; anthers yellow, with a tinge of red; filaments\r\n    five-sixteenths inch long; pistil glabrous, equal to the\r\n    stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, season of medium length; one and\r\n    three-eighths inches by one and three-sixteenths inches in\r\n    size, oval, halves equal; cavity small, narrow, shallow, rather\r\n    abrupt; suture an indistinct line; apex roundish or pointed;\r\n    color bright red, with thin bloom; dots few in number, light\r\n    russet, somewhat conspicuous, clustered about the apex; the\r\n    stem attached to a stem-like growth from the fruit-spurs gives\r\n    the appearance on the tree of a jointed stem, very slender,\r\n    three-quarters inch long, glabrous, not adhering well to the\r\n    fruit; skin tough, slightly astringent, separating readily;\r\n    flesh yellowish, very juicy and fibrous, tender and melting,\r\n    sweet next the skin but sour at the center, sprightly; fair\r\n    to good; stone adhering, seven-eighths inch by three-eighths\r\n    inch in size, long and narrow-oval, flattened, slightly necked\r\n    at the base, acute at the apex, roughened; ventral suture\r\n    wide, blunt, ridged; dorsal suture acute or with a shallow,\r\n    indistinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLARD\r\n\r\n_Prunus triflora_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ohio Hort.

Willard Japan 8.\r\n\r\nWillard is about the earliest of the Triflora plums that can be shipped\r\nto the markets. When this is said all is said; as the variety has little\r\nelse to recommend it, being very inferior in quality and having a\r\nreputation of being subject to shot-hole fungus. S. D. Willard, Geneva,\r\nNew York, procured cions of this variety from California about 1888\r\nfrom an importation made by Burbank from Japan. According to Willard,\r\nthe plum was received under the name Botan and he labelled it No. 26\r\nto avoid confusion; in 1893, it was named Willard by W. F. Heikes of\r\nthe Huntsville Nurseries, Huntsville, Alabama. The American Pomological\r\nSociety placed the variety on its fruit catalog list in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree medium to large, vigorous, vasiform, productive;\r\n    leaves falling early, folded upward, oblanceolate, one and\r\n    three-eighths inches wide, three and three-quarters inches\r\n    long, thin, glabrous; margin finely and doubly serrate, with\r\n    very small glands; petiole three-quarters inch long, with from\r\n    one to five reniform glands usually on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, of medium size, roundish or somewhat oblong, blunt\r\n    at the apex, dark red when well grown, covered with thick\r\n    bloom; stem short, thick, adhering poorly to the fruit; skin\r\n    sour; flesh greenish-yellow, rather firm, sweet, low in flavor;\r\n    poor in quality; stone variable in adhesion, of medium size.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLF\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOLF]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana mollis_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

It is noted for its great hardiness,\r\nreliability in bearing, attractive and well-flavored fruits and in being\r\none of the few freestones of its kind. This plum is remarkably well\r\nadapted for the northern part of the Mississippi Valley and there alone\r\nit is worth planting extensively. In New York it might prove valuable in\r\nthe coldest parts of the State where the Domesticas and Insititias cannot\r\nbe grown.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised from a pit of a wild plum planted on the farm of\r\nD. B. Wolf, Wapello County, Iowa, about 1852. Professor J. L. Budd of\r\nthe Iowa Agricultural College stated in 1885 that for over a quarter of\r\na century the original tree had not failed to produce a partial or large\r\ncrop annually on the grounds of the originator. A spurious clingstone\r\ntype of the Wolf has been propagated in some nurseries but this false\r\nplum is readily distinguished from the true freestone type. The variety\r\nwas added to the American Pomological Society fruit catalog list in 1889,\r\ndropped in 1891, and replaced in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, low, and open-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive, healthy; branches rough and shaggy, thorny, dark\r\n    ash-gray, with numerous, small lenticels; branchlets somewhat\r\n    slender, short, twiggy, with internodes below medium in length,\r\n    green changing to dull brownish-drab, overspread with thick\r\n    pubescence, with numerous, small lenticels; leaf-buds very\r\n    small, short, conical, strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, oval, one and seven-eighths inches wide,\r\n    three and seven-eighths inches long, thin; upper surface medium\r\n    green, lightly pubescent, with a narrow groove on the midrib;\r\n    lower surface silvery-green, pubescent; apex taper-pointed,\r\n    margin coarsely and doubly serrate, eglandular; petiole\r\n    one-half inch long, velvety, tinged red, glandless or with one\r\n    or two small, globose, yellowish glands on the stalk or base of\r\n    the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season of average length, late; flowers opening after\r\n    the leaves, one inch across, the buds tinged yellow changing to\r\n    white as the flowers expand; borne on lateral buds and spurs;\r\n    pedicels nine-sixteenths inch long, thickly pubescent, green;\r\n    calyx-tube greenish-red, campanulate, covered with short,\r\n    fine pubescence; calyx-lobes narrow, acute, heavily pubescent\r\n    on both surfaces, with few marginal glands, reflexed; petals\r\n    inclined to curl, long-oval, fringed, long and narrowly clawed;\r\n    anthers yellowish; filaments three-eighths inch long; pistil\r\n    sparingly hairy on the ovary, equal to or shorter than the\r\n    stamens, frequently defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; less than one inch in\r\n    diameter, roundish-oval or somewhat obovate, compressed, halves\r\n    equal; cavity frequently yellowish, shallow, narrow, abrupt;\r\n    suture an indistinct line; apex roundish or flattened; color\r\n    dull crimson, thickly mottled, overspread with thick bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, small, russet, inconspicuous; stem slender,\r\n    glabrous, adhering poorly to the fruit; skin thick, tough,\r\n    slightly roughened, astringent, adhering; flesh golden-yellow,\r\n    very juicy, fibrous, tender and melting, sweet next the skin,\r\n    but astringent toward the center; fair to good; stone semi-free\r\n    to free, five-eighths inch by three-eighths inch in size,\r\n    roundish-obovate, tapering at the base, blunt at the apex, with\r\n    smooth surfaces; ventral suture winged; dorsal suture acute, or\r\n    with a faint, narrow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOD]\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Minn.

It is sufficiently early to fit into the\r\nshort seasons of northern latitudes very well. Wood is one of the sorts\r\nthat can be recommended for the coldest parts of this State.\r\n\r\nThis variety, according to a letter from the originator and introducer,\r\nJoseph Wood of Windom, Minnesota, is a seedling from a choice plum\r\nfound growing on the bank of the Des Moines River, Cottonwood County,\r\nMinnesota.

In tree-characters, as the two grow at this\r\nStation, World Beater is perhaps the better plum. This variety has the\r\nsame place in pomology as Wayland, a place which it fills possibly a\r\nlittle better. It may be recommended for culinary purposes and as a late\r\nplum for regions where the peach is hardy. Plums of this species have\r\nsmall value in New York except for the sake of variety.\r\n\r\nWorld Beater was grown from a seed of a plum found near Nashville,\r\nTennessee, in 1838, by J. H. Tinsley and planted in Lincoln County,\r\nKentucky. About ten years later trees of the variety were taken to Clay\r\nCounty, Missouri, and were further propagated but the variety remained\r\npractically unknown until the fall of 1890 when it was introduced by\r\nStark Brothers of Missouri.\r\n\r\n    Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open and flat-topped, hardy\r\n    where the peach can be grown, productive; branches rough and\r\n    shaggy, somewhat thorny, dark ash-gray, with numerous, large\r\n    lenticels; branchlets medium to above in thickness and length,\r\n    twiggy, with internodes of average length, green changing to\r\n    dark chestnut-red, glossy, glabrous, with few, conspicuous,\r\n    large, raised lenticels; leaf-buds very small and short,\r\n    obtuse, plump, appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves folded upward, broadly lanceolate, peach-like, one and\r\n    three-quarters inches wide, four and one-half inches long,\r\n    thin; upper surface smooth, glossy, with a shallow groove on\r\n    the midrib; lower surface pubescent on the midrib and larger\r\n    veins; apex acuminate, base abrupt, margin serrate, glandular;\r\n    petiole one inch long, slender, tinged red, pubescent on one\r\n    side, with from two to six small, globose, brownish glands\r\n    scattered on the stalk or base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season late and long; flowers appearing after the\r\n    leaves, three-quarters inch across, white, with a disagreeable\r\n    odor; borne in clusters from lateral buds, in twos, threes\r\n    or fours; pedicels three-quarters inch long, very slender,\r\n    glabrous, green; calyx-tube greenish, campanulate, glabrous;\r\n    calyx-lobes narrow, acuminate, slightly pubescent towards the\r\n    base of the inner surface, serrate and with reddish glands,\r\n    erect; petals ovate, crenate, fringed, with pubescent claws of\r\n    medium width; anthers yellowish; filaments five-sixteenths inch\r\n    long; pistil glabrous, equal to the stamens in length.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, season short; one inch by seven-eighths inch\r\n    in size, roundish-ovate or oval, not compressed, halves equal;\r\n    cavity narrow, shallow, rather abrupt; suture a line; apex\r\n    pointed; color carmine, bloomless; dots medium in number,\r\n    small, whitish or sometimes reddish, somewhat conspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, medium to above in length, glabrous, not adhering to\r\n    the fruit; skin thick, tough, astringent, adhering slightly;\r\n    flesh light yellow, juicy, coarse, melting near the skin but\r\n    firmer and fibrous next the pit, sweet except near the center,\r\n    strongly aromatic; fair to good; stone often tinged red,\r\n    adhering, three-quarters inch by three-eighths inch in size,\r\n    oval, turgid, angular, pointed at the base and apex, roughish;\r\n    ventral suture wide, blunt, ridged; dorsal suture acute or with\r\n    an indistinct, shallow groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYANT\r\n\r\n_Prunus americana_\r\n\r\n    =1.= _Ia.

While it is almost\r\nbeyond question a true Americana (from its history it could hardly be\r\notherwise,) it has a number of characters that mark it as a departure\r\nfrom the usual type of _Prunus americana_. The calyx-tube is bright\r\nred, a character found only in a few other varieties of this species;\r\nthe stamens are much longer than is usual in the species and much more\r\nnumerous; the pistils are often defective; the flowers are borne in\r\ngreater profusion; the plums do not have the distinctive Americana taste;\r\nthe flesh is less juicy than usual; the skin is free and the stones are\r\nnearly free and have pitted surfaces. Some of these characters are so\r\nvaluable in a native plum that Wyant may well be used to breed from. The\r\ntrees from which the description here given was made came from C. L.\r\nWatrous, Des Moines, Iowa, and to the best of our belief are true to name.\r\n\r\nThis variety, according to a letter from J. E. Wyant, Shellsburg, Iowa,\r\nwas found by J. B. Wyant of Janesville, Iowa, while hunting for wild\r\nplums in 1866 on the Cedar River near his home. The following year he\r\ntransplanted the tree to his yard. About 1874, J. E. Wyant told R. Royce\r\nof Shellsburg, Iowa, proprietor of the Benton County Nursery, of this\r\ntree. Royce secured cuttings from the original tree and began propagating\r\nthe plum. Fruits were sent to Professor J. L. Budd, Ames, Iowa, who named\r\nit Wyant. The variety was introduced by Mr. Royce and was disseminated\r\nby him and by Professor Budd. In 1897 it was added to the fruit catalog\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\n    Tree small, spreading and straggling, flat-topped, very hardy,\r\n    productive, healthy; branches rough and shaggy, zigzag, thorny,\r\n    dark ash-gray, with numerous, large lenticels; branchlets\r\n    willowy, slender, long, with long internodes, greenish-red\r\n    changing to reddish-brown, glossy, glabrous, with conspicuous,\r\n    raised lenticels of average size and number; leaf-buds small,\r\n    pointed, strongly appressed.\r\n\r\n    Leaves falling early, folded upward, oval, one and five-eighths\r\n    inches wide, three and one-quarter inches long, thin; upper\r\n    surface green, smooth, glabrous, grooved on the midrib and\r\n    larger veins; lower surface silvery-green, lightly pubescent;\r\n    apex acuminate, base abrupt, margin coarsely and doubly\r\n    serrate, the serrations sharp-pointed, not glandular; petiole\r\n    one-half inch long, tinged red, pubescent, glandless or with\r\n    from one to five globose, yellowish-green glands on the stalk.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season medium to late, of average length; flowers\r\n    appearing with the leaves, showy on account of the many\r\n    blossoms and peculiar appearance caused by the numerous long\r\n    stamens, whitish, with disagreeable odor; borne in dense\r\n    clusters on lateral buds and spurs, one to four flowers in\r\n    each cluster; pedicels one-half inch long, slender, glabrous,\r\n    green, faintly tinged with red; calyx-tube red, obconic,\r\n    glabrous; calyx-lobes narrow, acute, lightly pubescent on\r\n    the inner surface, serrate and with numerous marginal hairs,\r\n    erect; petals small, narrow-ovate, crenate, with narrow, long\r\n    claws; stamens very numerous; anthers yellowish; filaments\r\n    three-eighths inch long; pistil slender, glabrous, shorter than\r\n    the stamens, often defective.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period short; one and one-quarter\r\n    inches in diameter, not symmetrical in shape, oblong-obovate\r\n    to nearly ovate, oblique, somewhat truncate, halves equal;\r\n    cavity shallow, narrow, flaring; suture a line; apex slightly\r\n    flattened; color dark carmine over a yellow ground which\r\n    largely disappears as maturity advances, with thin bloom;\r\n    dots numerous, very small, light russet, inconspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, one-half inch long, glabrous, dehiscent; skin thin,\r\n    tender, separating readily; flesh dark golden-yellow, juicy,\r\n    tender and melting, sweet, with the Americana flavor less\r\n    marked than in other varieties; of fair quality; stone nearly\r\n    free, seven-eighths inch by five-eighths inch in size, broadly\r\n    oval, flattened, blunt at the base, somewhat pointed at the\r\n    apex, with pitted, dark colored surfaces; ventral suture blunt\r\n    or slightly winged, shallowly ridged; dorsal suture acute, with\r\n    shallow, narrow, distinct groove.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW EGG\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW EGG]\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Rea _Flora_ 209. 1676. =2.= Ray _Hist.

As the largest and handsomest of the yellow plums it is worth\r\nconsideration by either the amateur or the commercial fruit-grower in New\r\nYork. At best, however, it is fit only for cooking and is none too good\r\nfor culinary purposes. The trees are very satisfactory on all but very\r\nlight soils. As has been suggested before, this plum ought to be crossed\r\nwith varieties of better quality with the hope of getting as handsome a\r\nfruit but one which could be used for dessert purposes.\r\n\r\nThe references and synonyms show that Yellow Egg is a plum with an\r\ninteresting history, but unfortunately the accounts of its origin\r\nand subsequent history have been but poorly preserved. Rea, in 1676,\r\ndescribed the Yellow Egg as the Bonum Magnum or Dutch Plum; we may\r\ninfer from this that the English obtained the variety from Holland.\r\nKnoop of Holland, in 1771, described the variety under the name Prune\r\nd’Oeuf Blanche, indicating a French origin. Knoop describes the Prune De\r\nMonsieur as similar and this plum has ever since been held as doubtfully\r\nidentical. Duhamel, in _Traite des Arbres Fruitiers_, 1768, described\r\nYellow Egg as the Dame Aubert. Kraft in _Pomona Austriaca_, 1796, gave\r\nit as the Die Grosse Weisse Glanzende, oder Die Albertus Damenpflaume.\r\nThese references show that Yellow Egg was well known at an early date.\r\nBecause of its close resemblance to many varieties, probably due to\r\nthe propagation of seedlings from it, much confusion exists in the\r\nnomenclature of Yellow Egg. White Imperial was separated by Duhamel and\r\nPrince; but Miller, Thompson and most of the subsequent writers give\r\nit as the same. Duhamel believed the Imperial Blanche (White Imperial)\r\nto be the Grosse Datte. So, too, the Wentworth was at first separated\r\nbut, later, was recorded as identical. Koch calls Yellow Egg one of the\r\nDatterpflaumen (Date Plums) though he states that there is another Date\r\nPlum known by Tragus more than three hundred years ago as Prunidactyla.\r\nDe Candolle seems to hold to the names Dame d’Aubert and Aubertina for\r\nthis plum. Professor Budd in exploring southwest Russia and Poland found\r\na Dame Aubert differing from our Yellow Egg only in minor characters\r\nwhich he was told came from central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the importation of Yellow Egg to this country is\r\nunknown. Coxe, in 1817, described it as the Mogul and later Prince gave\r\nit the name Yellow Egg. Owing to this change in name, we find America\r\nnow and then given as its place of origin by both American and English\r\nwriters. In 1862, the American Pomological Society added it to its\r\nfruit catalog list under the name White Magnum Bonum but in 1871, the\r\nname was changed to Yellow Egg. The Darwin Peach, sent out by Fell, a\r\nnurseryman in England, has proved to be identical at this Station and its\r\ndistributor, in a recent letter, states that this plum, which has been\r\ngrowing on his place thirty years, “is apparently identical to the White\r\nMagnum Bonum” which is of course Yellow Egg.\r\n\r\n    Tree, large, vigorous, round-topped, open, hardy, very\r\n    productive; trunk roughish; branches numerous, ash-gray, nearly\r\n    smooth, with rather large lenticels; branchlets slender,\r\n    short, with long intemodes, greenish-red changing to dull\r\n    brownish-red, dull, lightly pubescent throughout the season,\r\n    covered with thin bloom, with few, inconspicuous, small\r\n    lenticels; leaf-buds above medium in size, long, pointed, free.\r\n\r\n    Leaves flattened or somewhat folded backward, oval, two and\r\n    one-half inches wide, four and one-quarter inches long,\r\n    leathery; upper surface dark green, pubescent, slightly rugose,\r\n    with grooved midrib; lower surface medium green, thickly\r\n    pubescent; apex abruptly pointed or acute, base acute, margin\r\n    doubly serrate, with few dark glands; petiole five-eighths inch\r\n    long, thick, reddish-purple, pubescent, glandless or with one\r\n    or two globose, yellowish-green glands variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season short; flowers appearing after the leaves, one\r\n    inch across, white, with a yellowish tinge at the tip of the\r\n    petals; borne on lateral buds and spurs, singly or in pairs;\r\n    pedicels one-half inch long, covered with thick pubescence,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, campanulate, pubescent; calyx-lobes\r\n    broad, obtuse, pubescent, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals\r\n    roundish-oval, crenate or sometimes slightly notched, tapering\r\n    to short, broad claws; anthers yellow; filaments three-eighths\r\n    inch long; pistil pubescent, longer than the stamens; stigma\r\n    oblique.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, season short; two inches by one and five-eighths\r\n    inches in size, long-oval, compressed, halves nearly equal;\r\n    cavity of medium depth, narrow, abrupt; suture shallow, often\r\n    a line; apex roundish; color golden-yellow, covered with\r\n    thick bloom; dots numerous, small, white, inconspicuous; stem\r\n    slender, one and one-quarter inches long, pubescent, adhering\r\n    well to the fruit, surrounded at the cavity by a fleshy\r\n    collar; skin thin, slightly astringent, separating readily;\r\n    flesh golden-yellow, rather juicy, moderately coarse, firm, of\r\n    average sweetness, mild; good; stone semi-free or free, one and\r\n    one-quarter inches by three-quarters inch in size, oval, rather\r\n    flat, acute at the base and apex, with roughened and pitted\r\n    surfaces; ventral suture wide, heavily ridged, often distinctly\r\n    winged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW GAGE\r\n\r\n_Prunus domestica_\r\n\r\n    =1.= Prince _Treat.

There are now a great number of these\r\nplums under cultivation in America, most of which have originated in this\r\ncountry and nearly all of which, as we have said before, are better\r\nthan similar kinds from Europe. It is difficult to select from the\r\nnumerous first-rate plums of this group the best varieties to retain in\r\nhome or commercial orchards. Among these, however, Yellow Gage should be\r\nkept for the home orchard at least. It is a rather large fruit, with a\r\nbeautiful color—golden-yellow often with a faint blush, with a firm and\r\njuicy yet tender flesh and a most refreshing admixture of sweet and sour\r\ntogether with the richness which characterizes the Reine Claude plums.\r\nThe fruits come, too, at a time when the market is not overstocked with\r\nthese fine plums and the season is particularly long. A review of the\r\ntree-characters in the description which follows shows that in the main\r\nthey are good though some complain that the variety is not productive.\r\nThis precariousness in bearing, together with the tender skin which keeps\r\nYellow Gage from standing shipment well, probably precludes the variety\r\nfrom a high place in a commercial list but does not prevent its being a\r\nmost desirable plum for home planting.\r\n\r\nThis excellent old variety was probably one of the first plums to\r\noriginate in America. It came from a Reine Claude pit planted, with many\r\nothers, by William Prince[226] in 1783 in the celebrated Prince nurseries\r\nat Flushing, Long Island. Despite its early origin and fine qualities it\r\nhas never had much recognition from pomologists. Downing described it in\r\n1845 but neither Manning nor Kenrick in their excellent books on fruits\r\nmention this plum. The American Pomological Society in 1852 listed it\r\nwith the varieties of plums promising well and in 1856 placed it on the\r\nlist of those worthy of general cultivation.\r\n\r\n    Tree very large and vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, hardy,\r\n    productive; trunk roughish; branches dark ash-gray, smooth\r\n    except for the numerous, raised lenticels of various sizes;\r\n    branchlets medium to below in thickness, short, with internodes\r\n    of average length, greenish-red changing to brownish-red,\r\n    dull, lightly pubescent, with inconspicuous, small lenticels;\r\n    leaf-buds large, long, conical, free; leaf-scars prominent.\r\n\r\n    Leaves long-oval or obovate, two inches wide, four and\r\n    one-quarter inches long, thick, somewhat leathery; upper\r\n    surface dark green, covered with fine hairs, the midrib\r\n    grooved; lower surface silvery-green, sparingly pubescent; apex\r\n    and base acute, margin serrate, with few small, dark glands;\r\n    petiole five-eighths inch long, pubescent, tinged red, with\r\n    from one to three smallish, globose, greenish-yellow glands\r\n    variable in position.\r\n\r\n    Blooming season intermediate in time and length; flowers\r\n    appearing after the leaves, one and one-eighth inches wide,\r\n    white, fragrant; borne on lateral spurs, singly or in pairs;\r\n    pedicels seven-eighths inch long, with short, thin pubescence,\r\n    greenish; calyx-tube green, enlarged at the base, campanulate,\r\n    lightly pubescent; calyx-lobes narrow, obtuse, lightly\r\n    pubescent on both surfaces, glandular-serrate, reflexed; petals\r\n    oval, entire, tapering to short, broad claws; anthers yellow;\r\n    filaments one-quarter inch long; pistil glabrous, longer than\r\n    the stamens.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ripening period of medium length; one and\r\n    one-half inches by one and three-eighths inches in size, oval,\r\n    slightly compressed, halves nearly equal; cavity shallow,\r\n    narrow, abrupt; suture shallow; apex roundish or depressed;\r\n    dull yellow, faintly splashed and streaked with green,\r\n    sometimes tinged on the sunny side with light red, overspread\r\n    with thin bloom; dots numerous, small, white, inconspicuous,\r\n    clustered about the base; stem three-quarters inch long, thinly\r\n    pubescent, adhering well to the fruit; skin thin, rather sour,\r\n    separating readily; flesh golden-yellow, juicy, firm but\r\n    tender, sweet, mild, of pleasant flavor; very good; stone free,\r\n    the cavity larger than the pit, one inch by five-eighths inch\r\n    in size, oval, turgid, roundish, abruptly contracted at the\r\n    base, blunt at the apex; ventral suture broad, blunt, faintly\r\n    ridged; dorsal suture widely and deeply grooved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR VARIETIES OF PLUMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abbaye d’Arton.= Domestica. 1. _Cat.

The plum referred to by Waugh, in the\r\npreceding reference, is a variety of _Prunus domestica_. It is difficult\r\nto determine the species referred to by the older writers, but from the\r\nfrequency with which the word Damson appears as a synonym, it would seem\r\nthat some at least had in mind _Prunus insititia_.\r\n\r\nThe Horse plum brought into this country by the early Dutch or French\r\nsettlers, propagated by seedlings or suckers was probably an Insititia.\r\nDuring the first half of the last century, this plum was extensively\r\nraised in this State and large quantities were sold in the New York\r\nmarket.

It is appropriate that the following biographical sketch of\r\nMr. Prince, written for _The Grapes of New York_, should be reprinted\r\nhere. “William Robert Prince, fourth proprietor of the Prince Nursery and\r\nLinnaean Botanic Garden, Flushing, Long Island, was born in 1795 and died\r\nin 1869. Prince was without question the most capable horticulturist of\r\nhis time and an economic botanist of note. His love of horticulture and\r\nbotany was a heritage from at least three paternal ancestors, all noted\r\nin these branches of science, and all of whom he apparently surpassed\r\nin mental capacity, intellectual training and energy. He was a prolific\r\nwriter, being the author of three horticultural works which will always\r\ntake high rank among those of Prince’s time. These were: _A Treatise\r\non the Vine_, _Pomological Manual_, in two volumes, and the _Manual of\r\nRoses_, beside which he was a lifelong contributor to the horticultural\r\npress. All of Prince’s writings are characterized by a clear, vigorous\r\nstyle and by accuracy in statement. His works are almost wholly lacking\r\nthe ornate and pretentious furbelows of most of his contemporaries\r\nthough it must be confessed that he fell into the then common fault of\r\nfollowing European writers somewhat slavishly. During the lifetime of\r\nWilliam R. Prince, and that of his father, William Prince, who died in\r\n1842, the Prince Nursery at Flushing was the center of the horticultural\r\nnursery interests of the country; it was the clearing-house for foreign\r\nand American horticultural plants, for new varieties and for information\r\nregarding plants of all kinds.”\r\n\r\n[26] Manning, Robert _Hist.

I am informed that the ‘Italian Prune’\r\nranks highest as a table fruit when plucked from the tree. The process\r\nof drying prunes seems to be so very easy that I should suppose it might\r\nbe undertaken in this country with a certainty of success, and so as to\r\ntotally supersede the importation of that article.” _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[51] _United States Patent Office Report_: xxix. 1854. The following\r\ndescription of this distribution is of interest: “The scions of two\r\nvarieties of prunes, ‘Prunier d’Agen,’ and ‘Prunier Sainte Catherine,’\r\nhave been imported from France, and distributed principally in the states\r\nnorth of Pennsylvania, and certain districts bordering on the range of\r\nthe Allegany Mountains, in order to be engrafted upon the common plum.\r\nThese regions were made choice of in consequence of their being freer\r\nfrom the ravages of the curculio, which is so destructive to the plum\r\ntree in other parts as often to cut off the entire crop.

Hobart College)\r\ncrudely cultivated. On the adjoining farm of Mr. Henry Loomis descendants\r\nof these old trees still grow. The plums are Americanas, and Mr. Loomis,\r\nnow in his 94th year, says that when a boy the Indians and Whites alike\r\ngathered them, soaked them in lye to remove the astringency of the skins\r\nand then cooked, dried or otherwise preserved them.\r\n\r\n[112] Poiteau =1=: (Unpaged). 1846.\r\n\r\n[113] Waugh, F.

The foundation of our present knowledge of the cultivated\r\nspecies and races of American and Triflora plums was laid by the\r\ncomprehensive study of these fruits made by Bailey in the closing decade\r\nof the Nineteenth Century. His examination of plums may be said to have\r\nbegun in 1886 with the setting of an orchard of native plums—probably\r\nthe first general collection of these plums planted—on the grounds of\r\nthe Michigan Agricultural College, Lansing, Michigan. The results of\r\nhis studies have largely appeared in the publications of the Cornell\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station, the first of which was _The Cultivated\r\nNative Plums and Cherries_ published in 1892; _The Japanese Plums_,\r\n1894; _Revised Opinions of the Japanese Plums_, 1896; _Third Report upon\r\nJapanese Plums_, 1897; _Notes upon Plums_, 1897. Beside these bulletins\r\na monograph of the native plums was published in _The Evolution of our\r\nNative Fruits_ in 1898 and a brief but complete monograph of the Genus\r\nPrunus in the _Cyclopedia of American Horticulture_ in 1901. These are\r\nbut the chief titles under which his studies of plums have appeared,\r\nseveral minor contributions having been printed from time to time in\r\nthe horticultural press. While Dr. Bailey has given especial attention\r\nto all fruits grown in eastern America, it is probable that pomology is\r\nmost indebted to him for his long and painstaking work with the difficult\r\nGenus Prunus with which he has done much to set the varieties and species\r\nin order.\r\n\r\n[117] _Bot.

W. beyond the Mississippi, by the Chicasaws.” Bartram _Travels\r\nThrough North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, etc._\r\n38. 1793.\r\n\r\n[134] Bailey _Ev. Nat. Fr._ 193. 1898.\r\n\r\n[135] “The wild Plums of America are of several sorts. Those which I can\r\ngive an account of from my own Knowledge, I will, and leave the others\r\ntill a farther Discovery. The most frequent is that which we call the\r\ncommon _Indian_ Plum, of which there are two sorts, if not more. One of\r\nthese is ripe much sooner than the other, and differs in the bark; one\r\nof the barks being very scaly, like our _American_ Birch. These Trees,\r\nwhen in Blossom, smell as sweet as any Jessamine, and look as white as a\r\nSheet, being something prickly. You may make it grow to what Shape you\r\nplease; they are very ornamental about a House, and make a wonderful fine\r\nShew at a Distance, in the Spring, because of their white Livery. Their\r\nFruit is red, and very palatable to the sick. They are of a quick Growth,\r\nand will bear from the Stone in five years, on their Stock.” Lawson, John\r\n_History of Carolina_ 105. 1714.\r\n\r\n[136] “The third was known among the later colonists as the Indian cherry\r\nand was the product of a tree hardly exceeded by the English peach tree\r\nin girth and height, and showing an inclination for the soil of the\r\nvalleys of the rivers, and of the narrow bottoms of the smaller streams.\r\nThis variety was considered to be of extraordinary excellence in flavor;\r\nwhen ripe it was colored a dark purple, and there was only a single\r\ncherry to the stalk. There were two varieties of plums, resembling, both\r\nin size and taste, the English Damson.” Bruce, Philip Alexander _Economic\r\nHistory of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century_ =1=:94. 1896.\r\n\r\n[137] Frank A. Waugh was born in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, July 8,\r\n1869. On his father’s side he is of Scotch descent, though the family\r\nhas long been in America; his mother came from Germany. He was educated\r\nin the public schools of Kansas and in the Kansas State Agricultural\r\nCollege, graduating from the latter place in 1891. In 1893 he became\r\nprofessor of horticulture in the Oklahoma Agricultural College and\r\nhorticulturist at the Experiment Station, a place which he held for\r\nnearly three years, going late in 1895 to take the same position in the\r\nUniversity of Vermont. After eight years of arduous service in Vermont,\r\nduring which time he became well known by his writings on horticultural,\r\nbotanical and agricultural subjects, he left Vermont to take charge of\r\nhorticulture in the Massachusetts Agricultural College and the Hatch\r\nExperiment Station. Professor Waugh’s study of plums began in the West,\r\nKansas and Oklahoma, but his reports in regard to this fruit have come\r\nfrom Vermont where his work has been mainly done. The chief titles under\r\nwhich his studies have been published in the bulletins and annual reports\r\nof the Vermont Station are: _The Pollination of Plums_, _Classification\r\nof Plums_, _A Monograph of the Wayland Group of Plums_, _Hybrid Plums_,\r\n_Types of European Plums_, _Propagation of Plums_, _The Myrobalan Plums_,\r\n_A Review of the Americana Plums_ and _The Grouping of Japanese-Hybrid\r\nPlums_. In 1901 he published _Plums and Plum Culture_, a popular\r\npresentation of the various phases of his botanical and horticultural\r\nwork with this fruit. The titles given do not represent the extent of\r\nhis studies with this fruit for there were third and fourth reports upon\r\nseveral of the subjects mentioned. In particular he has been helpful\r\nto American pomology in the classification of native plums, in his\r\nstudy of sex in plums and in setting forth the hardiness of the various\r\nspecies and groups. Besides his papers on plums, Professor Waugh’s\r\nchief contributions to horticulture have been a book entitled _Fruit\r\nHarvesting, Storing, Marketing_, another under the title _Systematic\r\nPomology_ and two works on apples. He has also published two books on\r\nLandscape Gardening which have given him high standing in this division\r\nof horticulture. Professor Waugh will long be remembered in horticulture\r\nfor the great extent of his work, for his versatility in the profession\r\nand for his ability to present well to both readers and hearers, either\r\ntechnically or popularly, horticultural knowledge.\r\n\r\n[138] “The Sand Plums” _Country Gentleman_, Jan. 27, 1898.\r\n\r\n[139] Thomas Volney Munson, after whom it has been a pleasure to name\r\nthis species, though best known as a viticulturist, has also rendered\r\ninvaluable service to plum-culture. A sketch of his life appeared in\r\n_The Grapes of New York_ (page 122) in which his services to viticulture\r\nwere briefly mentioned. While his name is not commonly connected with\r\nthe study of plums, it is not too much to say that without his aid the\r\npublications of those who have written during the last quarter century on\r\nnative plums would have lacked much of the information they contain in\r\nregard to the species of the Southwest. He has an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe wild plums of Texas and has freely given of it to all who have asked,\r\noften supplementing information with herbarium specimens or plants. The\r\nauthors of _The Plums of New York_ wish to give him credit for much of\r\nthe information, furnished directly or indirectly, in regard to the wild\r\nand cultivated plums of the region in which he lives, in recognition of\r\nwhich his name is given to one of the most important species of native\r\nplums. Mr. Munson has grown and introduced a number of hybrid plums of\r\nnote, chief of those of his own growing being Nimon, Minco and Burford.\r\nMany of his experiments in hybridizing plums, though unproductive of new\r\nvarieties, are of much value as a guide to other workers with this fruit.\r\n\r\n[140] Lawson, John _History of Carolina_ 105. 1714.\r\n\r\n[141] Waugh _Vt.

The requisite for a prune-making plum\r\nis that it have a large proportion of solids, particularly sugar.\r\nComparatively few varieties of plums bear sufficient amounts of solids so\r\nthat they may be successfully cured into a firm, long-keeping product.\r\nOnly varieties of the Domesticas are used in making prunes, though\r\npossibly some of the Insititias might be so used. Prunes are chiefly\r\nused in cookery though some of the finer grades from France are sold as\r\nconfections.\r\n\r\nPrunes are either dried in the sun as in California; partially cooked\r\nin ovens and the curing completed indoors, as in European countries; or\r\nwholly dried in evaporators, as in the Pacific Northwest. Sun-drying is\r\nthe most economical method where the climate permits. The half cooking\r\ndoes not make so attractive a product but when skillfully done the prunes\r\nare possibly more palatable, as the cooked flavor is liked by consumers.\r\nBeyond question the best prunes are made, however, all things considered,\r\nin well-managed evaporators. In evaporators the changes of curing take\r\nplace most perfectly and uniformly so that, as a rule, the prune looks\r\nbetter, keeps longer, is not so tough and has a more natural taste of the\r\ngreen fruit.\r\n\r\nIn prune-making the fruit is allowed to remain on the trees until ripe\r\nenough to fall to the ground, as the maximum proportion of solids is thus\r\nobtained. After picking, the plums are passed over graders to remove\r\nrubbish and to secure uniformity in size, this being essential to obtain\r\nevenness in curing, since the small fruits dry more rapidly than large\r\nones. Usually before evaporation begins the fruit is dipped in boiling\r\nlye or pricked by needles in a pricking machine to make tender the tough\r\nskin and so allow the moisture to escape more readily. The dipping\r\nconsists of immersing the fruit for a minute or less in a solution of\r\nlye in the proportion of 1 pound of concentrated lye to from 10 to 50\r\ngallons of water maintained at the boiling point. The fruit is carried\r\nmechanically through the lye vat and a rinser by a modified endless\r\nchain, or it may be dipped in wire baskets. After rinsing the plums are\r\nready for curing.\r\n\r\nExposure to the sun in curing varies from five to twelve days, depending\r\nupon the heat of the sun and the size and the variety of the plum. Curing\r\nin evaporators varies with the fruit and with the make of the machine.\r\nIn general the temperature in the evaporator is from 120° to 140° at the\r\nstart, increasing to from 160° to 180° and decreasing when the prunes\r\nare taken out. Too much heat at first causes the cells of the fruit to\r\nburst, thereby producing drip and discoloration. Important factors in\r\nevaporating in machines are the circulation of air, convenience, cost of\r\nfuel and power. The time required for curing ranges from twelve hours for\r\na small plum to forty-eight hours for a large, juicy one. If not cured\r\nenough fermentation and molding result; if cured too much the weight is\r\nlessened, the quality is injured, the prune is harsh and coarse and has a\r\ndried up appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently dried the prunes are put in bins or piles to sweat,\r\na process taking from one to three weeks, after which they are graded,\r\nprocessed and packed. In grading, the prunes are separated into sizes\r\nindicating the number of prunes required to make a pound, as 30’s to\r\n40’s, 40’s to 50’s and so on to the smallest size, 120’s to 130’s. The\r\nprocessing is done by dipping the prunes in boiling water and glycerine\r\nor by steaming or by using some special preparation in the final dipping\r\nor by rattling in a revolving cylinder. Processing is reputable if it\r\nadds beauty to the color, or kills insects’ eggs or sterilizes the\r\nprunes. It is disreputable when the aim is to add to the weight. The best\r\nprunes are packed in boxes, in which process lining with paper, filling\r\nfacing, pressing and labeling are important details. A well cured prune\r\nis soft and spongy, the pit is loose but does not rattle, the skin is\r\nbright, the product is free from drippings or exudation, the flesh is\r\nmeaty, elastic, and of a bright, lively color.\r\n\r\nThe custom has been to bleach light colored prunes with sulphur fumes.\r\nThis process injures the quality and possibly makes the product somewhat\r\npoisonous. Sulphuring is now regulated by the Federal Pure Food Law.\r\n\r\nIf poorly managed or if the plums are not of the best, several\r\ndifficulties are encountered in curing prunes. Thus, a syrupy liquid\r\nsometimes oozes from the prunes, besmearing and making unattractive the\r\nfinal product. Again, the finished prunes may be covered with globules of\r\nsugar, rendering them sticky and destroying the lustre. Fruit grown on\r\npoor soils, on unhealthy trees or picked green may cure into small prunes\r\nof an abnormal shape called “Frogs” or they may ferment and swell up in\r\nlarge soft prunes called “Bloaters.”\r\n\r\nThe plum chiefly used in California in making prunes is the Agen, usually\r\ncalled Petite, a prune curing into a bright amber-colored product.\r\nThis plum is easily cured, and the prune from it needs little sugar in\r\ncooking. In the states north of California the Italian Prune is the\r\nfavorite, producing a dark red, almost black product, more tart but\r\non the whole rather better flavored than the prune from the preceding\r\nvariety. Other varieties more or less used are Golden Drop, the product\r\nfrom which is known as the Silver Prune; Reine Claude, which makes a\r\nfancy product often used as a confection; Yellow Egg, which sells as the\r\nSilver Prune when evaporated; the German Prune, making a product much\r\nlike the Italian Prune; “Hungarian Prune,” from a very large plum and\r\nmaking a fancy product but very difficult to cure; the Tragedy Prune, an\r\nearly plum of the Italian type; Golden Prune, much like the Silver and\r\npossibly better; and the Champion, Willamette, Pacific, Tennant, Steptoe\r\nand Dosch, all of the Italian type.\r\n\r\n[156] Farlow, W.

On his father’s\r\nside he was of French ancestry, but his mother was of English descent, a\r\nmember of the Lancaster family, early settlers on the Hudson River. He\r\nwas educated in the public schools of Monticello, Monticello Academy and\r\nat Hiram College, though he did not finish at the last named institution\r\nbecause of financial distress at home. In 1857 the young man moved west\r\nand for a year taught in an academy at Rockford, Illinois, and in the\r\nWheaton schools of the same state. In 1858 he moved to Benton County,\r\nIowa, where he established the Benton County Orchards and Nurseries. He\r\nsoon became identified with horticulture in Iowa, especially through its\r\nState Horticultural Society, an organization of which he was secretary\r\nfrom 1873 to 1885 and from 1892 to 1895, serving in all seventeen years.\r\nIn 1876 he was elected to the chair of Horticulture and Forestry in the\r\nIowa Agricultural College, a position which he held until 1899, when he\r\nretired as professor emeritus, having spent twenty-two years in pioneer\r\nwork in this college. In 1882 Professor Budd visited Russia to study the\r\nhardy plants of that country and imported from there many varieties of\r\nfruit, as well as other plants, which he thought suited to the climate\r\nof the Northwest. After his return his work was largely given up to\r\noriginating and testing varieties which he thought would prove of value\r\nto the States of the Plains. He was preeminent in America for his work\r\nwith Russian fruits and was one of the first to see the possibilities\r\nof our native plums. The frequency with which his name is mentioned\r\nin this book as a breeder of hardy fruits indicates his interest in\r\nsecuring plums adapted to the region in which he lived. The horticultural\r\nlibrary of Charles Downing, by the wish of the owner, was given to the\r\nIowa Agricultural College with the expectation that Professor Budd\r\nwould revise Downing’s famous _Fruits and Trees of America_. Ill health\r\nprevented the accomplishment of this task, although as senior author\r\nhe published, in 1902, the _American Horticultural Manual_ in two\r\nvolumes. During the greater part of his active life he was a constant\r\ncorrespondent of the horticultural press. Professor Budd was a teacher as\r\nwell as a pomologist and did much for American pomology in imparting to\r\nthe men who came in contact with him both knowledge and enthusiasm. He\r\ndied in Phoenix, Arizona, December 26, 1904.\r\n\r\n[205] Samuel D. Willard was born August 24, 1835, near Cayuga, New\r\nYork. He was educated in the district school, Canandaigua Academy, and\r\nTemple Hall, Geneseo, having been graduated at the last named place\r\nin 1854. After a successful business career of a decade and a half\r\nfollowing his schooling, Mr. Willard engaged in the nursery business\r\nin Geneva, New York. He prospered in tree-growing and soon embarked in\r\nfruit-growing as well, rapidly attaining distinction as a nurseryman and\r\nas a fruit-grower. He early began to specialize in plum culture and soon\r\nbecame one of the leading growers of plums, one of the chief authorities\r\non varieties, and one of the largest importers of new sorts. In 1897,\r\nwith Dr. L. H. Bailey as co-author, Mr. Willard prepared Bulletin 131,\r\n_Notes upon Plums_, of the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation. In this bulletin Mr. Willard put on record the results of\r\nhis long experience in growing plums and gave descriptions of seventy\r\nvarieties, nineteen of which he had imported from Europe. Besides\r\nthis bulletin he has published but little on plums, but his spoken\r\nwords regarding them may be found in nearly every report of the two\r\nhorticultural societies of New York since 1880, as they are also to be\r\nfound in the reports of horticultural societies in neighboring states and\r\nthe provinces of Canada. Besides his work in horticultural societies,\r\nMr. Willard was one of the earliest and foremost institute speakers in\r\nNew York. He was, too, for many years active in the development of the\r\nstate fair in New York, having charge of the horticultural department,\r\na position which he also held at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo\r\nin 1901. For nearly a half-century Mr. Willard has been prominent in\r\nhis profession in the state and nation; he is known by all eastern\r\nfruit-growers and his vigorous and enthusiastic utterances in the press,\r\nfrom the platform and in conversation have made him a favorite authority\r\nwith the fruit-growers of this generation.\r\n\r\n[206] Prosper Julius A. Berckmans was one of the noted horticulturists\r\nand pomologists of the generation just passing. He was born at Aerschat,\r\nnear Antwerp, Belgium, October 13, 1830, his father being Dr. Louis\r\nEdouard Berckmans, author of the splendid pomological work, _Album\r\nde Pomologie_, and as noted in Europe as was the son in America, in\r\nhorticulture and pomology. The younger Berckmans was educated in Tours,\r\nBelgium and Paris, attaining distinction as a student in botany. In\r\n1850 father and son came to America and the following year settled\r\nat Plainfield, New Jersey. Six years later the son moved to Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, and established near that place a horticultural plantation,\r\nwhich he called “Fruitlands,” the nursery of which has become famous\r\nthroughout the world. Soon after locating in Georgia, Mr. Berckmans\r\nbecame interested in horticultural organizations and later his activities\r\nwere extended to the promotion of horticulture in the Nation. In 1859\r\nhe became a member of the first horticultural society in Georgia. In\r\n1876 he helped to organize and was the first president of the Georgia\r\nState Horticultural Society, a position which he held until his death.\r\nIn 1860 he became a member of the American Pomological Society and was\r\nat once intrusted with important committee work in that organization.\r\nHis work here was done so well that in 1887 he was elected president of\r\nthe society and later was four times re-elected. Mr. Berckmans was a\r\nmember of a number of state and national horticultural and scientific\r\norganizations other than those named and was an honorary member of many\r\nsimilar societies in Europe. In 1893 he was chosen to make the opening\r\naddress of the Horticultural Congress held at the World’s Fair in Chicago\r\nthat year. Mr. Berckmans was eminent in entomology as well as in botany\r\nand horticulture and was interested in all the sciences. Through much\r\nreading, study and travel he became versed in literature and art as well\r\nas science. Mr. Berckmans’ fellow-workers in horticulture, his business\r\nassociates and the patrons of his nursery, justly esteemed him for his\r\namiability, integrity and public spiritedness. At his death, November 8,\r\n1910, a well spent life was ended.\r\n\r\n[207] Luther Burbank, known the world over for his work in bringing into\r\nbeing new plant forms, was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, March 7,\r\n1849. He was educated in the common schools and in the local academy, his\r\nschool-training being supplemented by much reading in the well-stocked\r\nlibrary of which every New England town boasts. After leaving school,\r\nsome time was spent in a factory in Worcester, Massachusetts, but,\r\nfollowing a strong natural inclination to work with plants, he left the\r\nfactory to grow vegetables and seeds. It was while so engaged that he\r\ngrew the Burbank potato, most widely known and most valuable, if gauged\r\nby the monetary value of the crops produced, of all of his new plants.\r\nIn 1875 Mr. Burbank went to California and a few years later began in a\r\nsmall way the plant-breeding nursery at Santa Rosa in which most of his\r\nwork has since been done. The years preceding this beginning and several\r\nfollowing it constitute a time of hard labor, sickness and of financial\r\ndistress through which only a man of remarkable strength of character\r\ncould have lived and kept the desire to continue his work. Following a\r\ndecade, more or less, of difficulties after the start at Santa Rosa, Mr.\r\nBurbank’s career as a world-wide figure in plant-breeding may be said to\r\nhave begun. One cannot briefly catalog the new forms of plants that have\r\ngone forth from his private place in California; they must number well\r\ninto the hundreds; his biographer, in 1905, said that Mr. Burbank has\r\nworked with over two thousand five hundred distinct species (Harwood,\r\nW. S., _New Creations in Plant Life_ 1. 1905). Among these have been\r\npractically all of the species of plums now under cultivation, from which\r\nhave been obtained, according to Mr. Burbank, hundreds of thousands of\r\nplum-seedlings of which the breeder has selected a score or more of very\r\ndistinct sorts, all interesting and a few of them very valuable. The many\r\nother fruits, flowers and forage plants which Mr. Burbank has sent out,\r\neach involving the handling of countless seedlings, cannot be mentioned\r\nhere. Nor can his methods and results be discussed, except to say that\r\nin them he is a unique figure in plant-breeding and that they have been\r\nsuch that he has exercised a powerful influence toward the improvement of\r\nplants. The practical results of Mr. Burbank’s work have been as great\r\nor greater than those secured by any other person in plant-breeding,\r\nyet they have been magnified out of all bounds in the popular press and\r\nhis work has been caricatured by calling the man a wizard and ascribing\r\nto him occult knowledge. Of the plants introduced by Mr. Burbank the\r\nproportion of really valuable commercial ones seems now to be small, but\r\nwhat he has done cannot be measured by money values; he has awakened\r\nuniversal interest in plant-breeding; has demonstrated that things\r\nunheard of before his time can be done with plants; and, all in all, his\r\ncontributions in new forms of plants to horticulture and agriculture, in\r\ntheir intrinsic and educational value, make him the master worker of the\r\ntimes in improving plants.\r\n\r\n[208] Statement in a letter from Mr. Burbank.\r\n\r\n[209] Mr. Kerr in a letter written in 1909 says: “Wassu, as I have it, is\r\nradically different from descriptions of both Waugh and Bailey. The tree\r\nis as slovenly in habit as is that of the Burbank—there all resemblance\r\nceases.”\r\n\r\n[210] This French plum proved to be the well-known Peach. See\r\n_Horticulturist_ =1=:115. 1846.\r\n\r\n[211] Mas _Le Verger_ =6=:61. 1866-73.\r\n\r\n[212] Mr. Kerr writes: “As I have them here, Yeddo and White Kelsey\r\nare the same. If there is a difference between Georgeson and Mikado, I\r\nhave failed to discover it, but Georgeson and White Kelsey or Yeddo are\r\nplainly distinct. The former is larger, rounder and more greenish in skin\r\ncolor.”\r\n\r\n[213] Introduced by Wiley and Company of Cayuga, New York in 1892. See\r\n_Cornell Sta.

Terry was born in Cortland County, New York, July 12th, 1826.\r\nHis parents were from New England having come as pioneers to New York\r\nfrom Worcester, Massachusetts. The spirit of pioneering seems to have\r\nbeen strong in the Terry family for in 1836 the parents moved again to\r\nLivingston County, Michigan. The son, leaving his parents in 1845, again\r\nwent westward to Knox County, Illinois, and still again in 1846 farther\r\nwest to Pottawattamie County, Iowa. After this there were still more\r\nwanderings in which Mr. Terry and his family, he having married in 1848,\r\nwere as far east as New Haven, Connecticut, for two years and again west\r\nto several places in Iowa. He finally engaged in the nursery business at\r\nCrescent, Iowa in 1857; he lived here for over fifty years, giving to the\r\nworld his best services in the production of new fruits and flowers, and\r\nhere his death occurred February 14th, 1909. Mr. Terry was noted as a\r\npeony and a plum specialist. Of plums he is the originator of over fifty\r\nsorts nearly all from the native species—a record unsurpassed in point\r\nof numbers for new varieties by any other plum-breeder. Several of Mr.\r\nTerry’s plums are of surpassing merit for varieties of their species;\r\namong these may be named such well-known sorts as Gold, Hammer, Hawkeye,\r\nNellie Blanche, Crescent City, Downing and Milton. Most of his varieties\r\nare offspring of _Prunus americana_ but there are a few from _Prunus\r\nmunsoniana_ and _Prunus hortulana_. Unfortunately there is little in\r\nregard to Mr. Terry’s method of breeding plums on record for he seems to\r\nhave written or spoken little for publication. He was long a prominent\r\nmember of the Iowa State Horticultural Society and for a number of years\r\nhad charge of one of the experiment stations of this society. Of his work\r\nwith peonies, of which he produced more than one hundred named sorts, and\r\nwith other plants, space does not permit discussion. The last half of his\r\nlife of more than four score years was a tireless effort to improve the\r\nfruits and flowers of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n[218] Lauche _Deut.

When he was eleven years of age the Lord family moved to\r\nLapeer, Michigan, where the subject of this sketch attended the district\r\nschool and then for a time was in a private school at Pontiac, Michigan.\r\nIn 1852 Mr. Lord moved to Winona County, Minnesota, where he built a\r\nsaw mill, and for some years owned and managed a lumber yard. It was\r\nonly after middle life that he became interested in horticulture and he\r\nthen chose the native plums as fruits with which to work. He was not a\r\nbreeder of plums and the Rollingstone, brought in from the wild and sent\r\nout by him in 1882, is the only addition to pomology, in the way of a\r\nnew variety, made by him. The work with this fruit which has given him\r\na name as a plum specialist was in testing hardy varieties. He tried\r\nthoroughly all the native plums to be obtained, and much of the present\r\ninformation as to the hardiness of plums for the cold northwest is due\r\nto knowledge gained from Mr. Lord’s experimental orchard. He became a\r\nmember of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society in 1884 and in 1889\r\nwas made an honorary life member of this organization. For some years\r\nhe was a Farmers’ Institute lecturer on horticulture and was for a time\r\nhorticultural editor of _Farm, Stock and Home_. He was not only known\r\nin the Northwest as a plum specialist but carried on correspondence\r\nwith plum growers throughout the whole country giving much valuable\r\ninformation regarding this fruit. Beside giving attention to plums he\r\ntested many apples for his region and was the originator of one or two\r\nvarieties now very generally grown in his State. During his life he\r\nfilled several places of public trust, being a member of the Territorial\r\nLegislature in 1853-4 and of the State Legislature in 1873-4. He also\r\nserved at various times in minor offices in his County and in his State\r\nbeing at the time of his death a member of the Forest Reserve Board of\r\nMinnesota. With Peter Gideon he was one of the pioneer fruit-growers\r\nin the Northwest and while he has left few fruits of his own breeding\r\nand few records in print of the work he did, yet his long and faithful\r\nservice in developing fruit-growing in the Northwest makes him one of the\r\nmen of note in American pomology. Mr. Lord died July 21, 1906.\r\n\r\n[221] Of this fruit Burbank writes to this Station under date of December\r\n6, 1909, as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have this season also about 65,000 or 75,000 Plumcot seedlings,—a\r\nwholly new fruit which promises great things for localities where it\r\ncan be grown. These Plumcots vary more astonishingly from seed than\r\nanything which I have ever produced. No pure Apricots or pure Plums are\r\nproduced, but every possible variety and every possible combination\r\nand all qualities are brought out strongly. The range of colors is\r\nastonishing,—some new combinations of colors never before seen in fruits\r\nhave been produced. The best California judges of fruits—the great\r\ngrowers and shippers—have pronounced some of these varieties the best\r\nfruit ever produced on this earth. Most of these fruits have a beautiful\r\ndowny skin—many of them smooth—flesh orange, yellow, white, crimson or\r\ngreen; pits peculiar. The fruits vary from about the size of a medium\r\npeach down to the size of Green Gage plums, though the various ones are\r\nof every possible size, form, flavor, color, time of ripening, etc. The\r\ntrees, in some cases, grow faster than any other fruit tree. Sometimes\r\nbranches grow on even quite young trees twelve feet in length and an inch\r\nin diameter in a single season. Others are quite slow growers or even\r\ndwarfs.”\r\n\r\n[222] _Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt._ 105. 1891.\r\n\r\n[223] J. W. Kerr, one of the best informed and most enthusiastic\r\ncultivators of native and Triflora plums, was born in York County,\r\nPennsylvania, January 23, 1842. He is of Scotch-Irish lineage paternally\r\nand of English ancestors maternally. His education at the village school\r\nwas supplemented by several years teaching and much reading and study\r\nin horticultural literature, fondness for which seems to have been\r\ninborn. In his early manhood Mr. Kerr engaged in growing trees for sale,\r\na business with which he soon combined a fruit plantation in which he\r\ncollected and tested all the plums that could be grown in his climate,\r\ncomprising the great majority of the varieties of American species and\r\nof the Oriental plums. This work began in 1870, since which time no man\r\nhas done more to popularize and improve native plums than Mr. Kerr. His\r\nmost valuable work has been in testing varieties, where his knowledge\r\nof this fruit, his judgment and his sense of discrimination have made\r\nhis opinion, as set forth in his nursery catalog and in the reports of\r\nhorticultural societies, authoritative. He has, too, done considerable\r\nwork in breeding plums, Choptank, Sophie and Maryland probably\r\nrepresenting the best of his endeavors in originating new plums. It is a\r\nduty and a pleasure to acknowledge here the great services rendered by\r\nMr. Kerr in the preparation of _The Plums of New York_.\r\n\r\n[224] Emmett Stull Goff was born at Elmira, New York, Sept. 3, 1852.\r\nHe was educated in the public schools and in the Elmira Free Academy,\r\ngraduating from the last named place in 1869. The following years were\r\nspent on his father’s farm until in 1880 he became Associate Editor of an\r\nagricultural paper, but finding the work uncongenial he returned to the\r\nfarm for a short time leaving again to accept in 1882 a position at the\r\nNew York Agricultural Experiment Station which had just been established.\r\nHere for seven years Professor Goff gave his attention to vegetables. His\r\nclassification of a number of vegetables, the pea, tomato, cabbage and\r\nonion in particular, are still standard in American vegetable culture.\r\nDuring his work at this Station he did much pioneer work in spraying\r\nplants and invented a device for mixing kerosene and water. In 1889\r\nProfessor Goff moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where he became professor\r\nof horticulture in the University of Wisconsin and horticulturist of\r\nthe Wisconsin Experiment Station. Here for fourteen years he gave his\r\nattention to various phases of fruit-growing and vegetable-growing.\r\nHis bulletin 87 on “Native Plums” is the outcome of several years’\r\nexperiments in testing and breeding plums of such of our native species\r\nas will grow in Wisconsin. His work with plums is particularly valuable,\r\nas he was able, in his location, to do much to ascertain the degree\r\nof hardiness of many varieties of the species of cultivated plums.\r\nFrom his work with sterility and fertility of varieties came valuable\r\nrecommendations regarding the cross-pollination of such varieties as\r\nare self-sterile. He is the author of _Principles of Plant Culture_ and\r\n_Lessons on Fruit-growing_, text books much used in high schools and\r\nagricultural colleges. Professor Goff was a modest and retiring man but\r\nsingularly independent of view in all things regarding his work and all\r\nthings that concerned men—a serene, lofty-minded, unselfish man. His\r\ndeath occurred at Madison, June 6th, 1903.\r\n\r\n[225] Aug. Royer _Annales De Pomologie Belge et Etrangere_ 63. 1859.\r\n\r\n[226] William Prince, born in 1725, was the second proprietor of the\r\nfamous Prince nursery at Flushing, Long Island, a nursery established by\r\nhis father, Robert Prince, about 1730. The first of the American Princes\r\nwas one of the Huguenots who settled at New Rochelle and on the north\r\nshore of Long Island, bringing with them a great number of French fruits\r\nand the love of the French people for horticulture. The nursery, one\r\nof the first, and certainly the most important one in America at this\r\ntime, grew rapidly until the Revolutionary War. The establishment was of\r\nsuch public importance that during a part of the war the British placed\r\na guard over it to protect it from depredation. With the establishment\r\nof peace came an increased trade and the nursery soon attained even\r\ngreater prominence than before the war. An effort was made by William\r\nPrince, then in charge, to import all of the valuable European fruits\r\nbeside which he grew many seedlings, selecting carefully from them new\r\nvarieties. Thus in 1790 twenty-five quarts of Reine Claude plum pits\r\nwere planted from which came Yellow Gage, Imperial Gage and probably the\r\nWashington plum. Prince died in 1802, his business having been divided\r\nbetween two sons; Benjamin Prince keeping the original place under the\r\nname The Old American Nursery and William Prince occupying a new place\r\ncalled the Linnean Botanic Garden and Nursery. William Prince seems not\r\nto have had the inclination to write as did his son and grandson but\r\nhad, even more than they, business energy. His European exportations\r\nand importations made his name famous in horticulture abroad as well\r\nas at home. To him Americans owe the introduction of many varieties of\r\nforeign fruits and ornamental plants; his was the first of the great\r\nnurseries of the country, soon to be followed by others, to import and\r\nexchange plants with foreign countries; his is the first recorded attempt\r\nto breed fruits in America on an extensive scale and the fact that the\r\nthree plums sent out by him are still valuable varieties indicates his\r\njudgment as to worth in fruits. The reputation made by his son, William\r\nPrince, the second, and by William Robert Prince, a grandson, as writers\r\non horticultural subjects, is in large measure due to the information\r\nacquired for them and the training given them by the William Prince of\r\nthis sketch.\r\n\r\n[227] Gilbert Onderdonk was born in Sharon, New York, September 30, 1829.\r\nAs a boy he showed a taste for horticulture and while a lad planted seeds\r\nof potatoes, made selections and developed several varieties more or\r\nless widely grown in the middle of the last century. Mr. Onderdonk was\r\neducated in the Cortland Academy at Cortland, N. Y., and in the State\r\nNormal College at Albany. After having taught in the district schools of\r\nNew York for a few years, he found it necessary to go to a warmer climate\r\nbecause of bronchial trouble and in 1851 moved to Texas, where he became\r\na cowboy, a rancher and finally a fruit-grower. In the region in which\r\nhe had settled there were wild grapes and wild plums in abundance. The\r\nluxuriance of growth and the number of these fruits so impressed him with\r\nthe possibilities of fruit culture in southwestern Texas that he began\r\nplanting fruit trees. Of necessity these came from the north and for most\r\npart failed. Not to be discouraged, Mr. Onderdonk began the improvement\r\nof the wild varieties about his home. From 1855 to the present time his\r\nwork has been the testing for the region in which he lives, of every\r\nvariety of fruit to be had in Europe and America, and the improvement of\r\nthe wild fruits growing about him. The plum, in particular, has received\r\nattention from Mr. Onderdonk, and his chief work with this fruit has\r\nbeen the hybridization of Triflora and Munsoniana varieties from the\r\ncrossing of which he has grown some valuable plums. In 1887, the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture employed Mr. Onderdonk to work with\r\nplums, grapes and peaches in the southwest, the results of which are to\r\nbe found in the reports of the Department immediately following the year\r\nmentioned. He has also done considerable work for the French in sending\r\nresistant vines to France. Mr. Onderdonk is one of several workers in\r\nhorticulture who have unremittingly served Texas and the southwest in the\r\nproduction of new varieties of fruits and in testing varieties from other\r\nregions. The value of the foundation these men have laid for horticulture\r\nin the southwest cannot now be estimated.\r\n\r\n[228] _Mich. Sta. Bul._ =118=:52, 54. 1895.\r\n\r\n[229] Thomas _Am. Fruit Cult._ 493. 1897.\r\n\r\n[230] Joseph L. Normand was born at Marksville, Louisiana, January 14,\r\n1853. He was educated in the public schools of the parish in which he\r\nlived. After leaving school he followed the vocation of a printer for a\r\nnumber of years, though from childhood horticulture had been an avocation\r\nwith him. Before middle life he gave up office work to begin actively\r\nthe growing of nursery and fruit trees. His work in horticulture early\r\ndeveloped into plant-breeding and towards the close of his life all of\r\nhis energies were devoted to the production of new types of plants. In\r\nhis plant-breeding Mr. Normand became noted as a hybridizer and a great\r\nmajority of the fruits and ornamentals sent out by him were hybrids.\r\nAmong these may be named the Carnegie Orange, a hybrid more or less\r\nfrost resistant, which he obtained by crossing the Louisiana Sweet\r\nOrange with _Citrus trifoliata_. Mr. Normand also devoted much time to\r\nthe testing of figs and sent out the New French Fig, selected from some\r\nseventy varieties which he had grown. Pears, apples and plums received\r\nhis attention and in all these fruits he developed original types by\r\nhybridization. Possibly his most meritorious work with the plum has been\r\nin testing Triflora and native varieties, although he has sent out not\r\na few hybrids of this fruit most of which, however, do not thrive in\r\nnorthern climates. Mr. Normand did for his region what Kerr, Munson,\r\nTerry, Lord and Williams have done in other parts of North America\r\nin testing plums. All who knew Mr. Normand say that in this day of\r\ncommercialism he worked almost wholly for the love of plants—to improve\r\nthem for his fellow fruit-growers regardless of the money to be made\r\nin his calling. He lived and worked in a region where his achievements\r\nwere at first little known and little understood, quite content to work\r\nfor his work’s sake, but in the end he gained distinction among the\r\nfruit-growers of his State and attracted the attention of plant-breeders\r\nall over the United States. Mr. Normand died in the town of his birth,\r\nApril 17, 1910.\r\n\r\n[231] A. L. Bruce, whose name appears so frequently in the pages of _The\r\nPlums of New York_ as a breeder of native plums, is of Scotch descent.\r\nHis father, however, came from Illinois to Texas, settling at Basin\r\nSprings, Grayson County, in 1845, where he planted the first orchard in\r\nthat part of Texas. The son, subject of this sketch, was born October 6,\r\n1861, and was educated in the common schools at Basin Springs, Texas. His\r\nwork in growing and breeding trees began in his youth, for in 1877 he\r\nestablished himself as a grower and collector of native plums to which\r\nhe added many of the Triflora varieties that were soon after introduced\r\nfrom Japan. Mr. Bruce’s first definite problem in breeding plums was to\r\nfind extra early and extra late sorts for Texas; his Six Weeks, Red May,\r\nDayton and several other plums were the results of these efforts. In 1902\r\nMr. Bruce moved to Donley County in the Panhandle of Texas from which\r\nplace he has sent out and continues to send out Triflora, native and\r\nhybrid plums of unusual merit. Beside working with plums Mr. Bruce is a\r\nbreeder of peaches, pears, raspberries, dewberries and apples, to all of\r\nwhich fruits he has made more or less notable contributions. Mr. Bruce is\r\nstill in the prime of life, has many plant-breeding problems projected\r\nand his work promises much for horticulture in the Southwest and in the\r\ncountry at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nWords surrounded by _ are italicized.\r\n\r\nWords surrounded by = are bold.\r\n\r\nIllustrations were relocated to correspond to their references in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nThe illustration “October” was apparently omitted from the book (three\r\ndifferent copies checked).\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors corrected and inconsistent spellings have been\r\nkept, including inconsistent use of hyphen, accents, capitalisation, and\r\nproper names.\r\n\r\nIndex entries that do not match their referenced text corrected (except\r\nwhere the text is an obvious printer error).
