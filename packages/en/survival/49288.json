(FROM A PAINTING BY ERNEST\r\n    UNTERMAN.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Spade and Pick]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you approach Dinosaur National Monument from Jensen, Utah, you see\r\nthe mass of Split Mountain and the deep, short canyons that scar its\r\nsouth slope near the Green River’s gorge. As you cross the National\r\nMonument boundary the grand view is lost and you begin to notice\r\ndetails. The masses of gray shale that seem to be carelessly piled\r\nagainst the tilted sandstone layers are bare of vegetation. The ground\r\nbetween the hills and the Green River is covered with sagebrush and\r\ngreasewood, while along the river itself are a few large cottonwood\r\ntrees and many bushes. A sharp turn brings a change of scene as your car\r\nenters a portal in the wall you have been following. The pronounced tilt\r\nof the rocks becomes more obvious.\r\n\r\nA final steep climb and the visitor center is at hand. This building\r\nencloses a significant part of the Dinosaur Quarry, perhaps the greatest\r\ndeposit of fossil dinosaur bones known today. From this quarry have come\r\nmany of the dinosaur skeletons that are seen today in our great museums.\r\nAfter parking, a short walk to the overlook on the southeast reveals a\r\nsplendid view of Split Mountain. Between that broad arch of eroded\r\nsandstone and the quarry lie steeply tilted sedimentary rocks of various\r\ncompositions and hues. Buff and gray sandstones that weather into soft\r\nshapes are separated by reddish-brown shale. Directly to the east is a\r\nsection of varicolored shale whose pastel pinks, reds, greens, grays,\r\nand whites justify the name of “rainbow beds” that was given them by\r\ngeologists. In the upper part of this section are hard sandstone and\r\nlimestone layers that resist the erosive action of wind and water. They\r\nstand higher than the softer shales and form hogbacks that rim Split\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nOne of these layers can be traced across the ravine immediately east of\r\nthe parking area into the sandstone ledge that forms the north wall of\r\nthe visitor center. This is the famous Dinosaur Ledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Quarry\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaur Ledge is famous because here the world’s greatest store of\r\nfossil bones of these long extinct reptiles has been uncovered. Two\r\ngroups, or orders, of dinosaurs have been discovered, with a number of\r\ndifferent types or kinds somewhat related to each other within these\r\norders. From the fossil bones, scientists can tell that these creatures\r\nvaried greatly in size and habits of living.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TILTED ROCK STRATA NEAR THE DINOSAUR QUARRY.]\r\n\r\nSome were the size of chickens, others as big as horses, and others of\r\nsuch gigantic size that no land animal alive today can compare with\r\nthem. Some were flesh-eaters as indicated by the size and shape of their\r\nteeth and their long sharp claws. Others were plant-eaters and again it\r\nis the structure of their teeth and feet that tell us this. The\r\nflesh-eaters were two-footed and walked on their hind legs, balancing\r\nthemselves with heavy long tails. Their short front legs were used as\r\nclawed-arms for tearing at the flesh of other dinosaurs. Many\r\nplant-eaters, on the contrary, were large, heavy, four-footed beasts,\r\noften with long necks and tails. Many of the dinosaurs were land\r\ndwellers, and many others lived in the great marshes and swamps of the\r\nlong Mesozoic (middle life) Era of the earth’s history.\r\n\r\nThough the subclass of reptiles we call dinosaurs lived all through the\r\nMesozoic Era, those whose fossil bones have been uncovered in this\r\nDinosaur Quarry are embedded in a stratum of rock called the Morrison\r\nformation. This rock stratum dates from the Jurassic Period in the\r\nmiddle of the Mesozoic Era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Dinosaurs\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FIRST DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nToday, most of us would recognize a fossil bone for what it is, but in\r\nthe 1790’s things were different. Isolated legbones, vertebrae, and\r\nteeth of huge reptiles had been dug out of certain sedimentary rocks of\r\nEurope and North America but their scientific importance was little\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThese specimens were found by people in all walks of life and it was\r\nnatural that their curiosity was greatly aroused. The finders took the\r\nspecimens to someone nearby whom they considered more competent to tell\r\nthem something about these strange bones and teeth. In nearly all cases\r\nthese “experts” were doctors of medicine. They studied the fossil\r\nspecimens and reported on them at regular meetings of the learned\r\nsocieties of which they were members. It was customary to put the\r\nfossils in the collections of these societies where they could be\r\nstudied by other members. In North America most reports of these early\r\ndiscoveries are found in the _Proceedings of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety_ in Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nBy 1842 accumulated knowledge of these large reptiles was sufficient to\r\nshow that they were distinct from any group then known. This was first\r\nrecognized by Sir Richard Owen of the British Museum. It was he who\r\nnamed the group _Dinosauria_. The name is made up of two Greek words:\r\n_deinos_ (terrible) plus _sauras_ (lizard).\r\n\r\nAs knowledge of these unusual reptiles increased through the discovery\r\nof additional types and more complete and better preserved specimens, it\r\nbecame evident that dinosaurs were neither a single group of reptiles\r\nnor were all of them large. Actually the dinosaurs show as much\r\ndiversity in size, body form, and habits as any group of reptiles. The\r\nsmallest dinosaur walked on its 2 hind legs like a chicken and was about\r\nthe same size. The largest walked on all 4 legs, was about 80 feet long,\r\nand weighed 30 to 40 tons. As examples of variety in body form there are\r\nthe two-footed, flesh-eating _Antrodemus_, the armored _Stegosaurus_,\r\nthe turtle-like _Ankylosaurus_, the horned _Triceratops_, the huge\r\n_Apatosaurus_, the two-footed vegetarian _Camptosaurus_, and the great\r\nvariety of head forms in the aquatic hadrosaurs. Although there were two\r\ndistinct groups, we still retain the term “dinosaur” as a convenient\r\nname for all of them but qualify it by saying, flesh-eating dinosaur,\r\nplant-eating dinosaur, armored dinosaur, etc., to indicate the\r\nparticular type we are talking about. Perhaps you are wondering how all\r\nthese ancient creatures are related to reptiles in general. Where do\r\nthey fit in the classification system devised to bring order to this\r\nmass of knowledge?\r\n\r\n\r\n                  POSITION OF DINOSAURS AMONG REPTILES\r\n\r\nIt seems there are several orders of reptiles similar to and closely\r\nrelated to the dinosaurs. Remains of these reptiles are found in the\r\nsedimentary rocks which contain the earliest known dinosaurs. A number\r\nof them resembled the dinosaurs but do not quite meet the requirements\r\nas far as details of the skeleton are concerned. In the scheme of\r\nclassification these orders of reptiles are grouped together into the\r\nsubclass _Archosauria_. This subclass includes the dinosaurs,\r\ncrocodiles, and the flying reptiles. The lizards, snakes, turtles, and\r\nthe tuatera of New Zealand belong to other subclasses of reptiles which\r\nhave been distinct from that of the dinosaurs as far back in geologic\r\ntime as we can trace them. The kinship between the dinosaurs and the\r\nsmall lizards living in the monument today lies only in that both are\r\nreptiles. The only living relatives of the dinosaurs are the alligator\r\nand the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThe dinosaurs were so numerous, and so dominated the whole of the\r\nMesozoic Era, that this period of earth history is frequently referred\r\nto as the Age of Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEOLOGIC HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era began some 200 million years ago and ended some 60\r\nmillion years ago. Although many other animals lived during that era,\r\nthe dinosaurs were the dominant forms of animal life on land. The 140\r\nmillion years of the Mesozoic are divided into geologic periods named\r\nTriassic (the oldest), Jurassic, and Cretaceous (the most recent).\r\nContinental deposits representing each of these periods have been found\r\nin all parts of the world and on all continents. Dinosaur bones have\r\nbeen found in these deposits—even in such far-away places as Australia\r\nand the southern tip of South America. Only Jurassic dinosaurs have been\r\nfound at Dinosaur National Monument.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Coelophysis_—SMALL TRIASSIC DINOSAURS, FORERUNNERS\r\n    OF THE HUGE DINOSAURS OF JURASSIC PERIOD. (DRAWN BY MARGARET M.\r\n    COLBERT. COURTESY, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\nThe oldest known dinosaurs are found in rocks of the Triassic Period.\r\nThe smaller of these were chicken-size and the largest were about as big\r\nas kangaroos. All of these Triassic dinosaurs were two-footed. They can\r\nbe divided into flesh-eaters and plant-eaters, although none are\r\nbelieved to have been particularly specialized in their food habits. In\r\ngeneral the flesh-eaters were small, agile, and had sharp teeth for\r\nseizing and overpowering active prey. The plant-eaters were larger with\r\nrather long front legs and small blunt teeth suited only to cropping\r\nvegetation. These plant-eaters are believed to be the Triassic ancestors\r\nof the giant marsh-dwelling dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\nPeriods.\r\n\r\nA greater variety of dinosaurs lived during the Jurassic Period than in\r\nthe Triassic. Both two- and four-footed types were present. The\r\nflesh-eaters remained two-footed but increased in size. _Antrodemus_,\r\nperhaps the best known, was much bigger than a kangaroo. The larger\r\nplant-eaters weighed from 30 to 40 tons and all were four-footed. The\r\nlargest land animals, they lived on dry land and in the swamps that\r\nformed an important part of the Jurassic landscape. The first of the\r\narmored plant-eating dinosaurs, _Stegosaurus_, inhabited the dry plains.\r\nThere were also some smaller, kangaroo-size plant-eaters that were\r\ntwo-footed.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of dinosaur fossils has been found in the rocks of the\r\nCretaceous Period, the last of the Mesozoic Era. The huge swamp dwellers\r\nstill thrived. The flesh-eaters had evolved much larger types and\r\nincluded 40-foot _Tyrannosaurus_, the largest that ever lived. All the\r\nflesh-eaters walked on their hind legs as did their predecessors of the\r\nJurassic and Triassic Periods.\r\n\r\nNew and interesting dinosaurs were present among the flesh-eaters.\r\nHorned forms, somewhat similar to the rhinoceros but much larger, were\r\ncommon. Also common were the turtle-like ankylosaurs. Perhaps the oddest\r\nand most interesting dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were the two-footed\r\nhadrosaurs. These excellent swimmers had weird head shapes with\r\ncomplicated skull passages and openings. They were a very successful\r\ngroup and at least 15 different kinds are known from the Cretaceous\r\nrocks of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE\r\n\r\nIdeas about the external appearances of dinosaurs have been developed\r\nafter many years of work and study. They are a combination of the ideas\r\nof several people who had studied different specimens of a single\r\nspecies. Let us review briefly the materials and work necessary to\r\narrive at a reasonably accurate picture of the body form and external\r\nappearance of these strange reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe first requirement for arriving at a good idea of the build and\r\nphysical attitude of an animal is a nearly entire skeleton. We cannot\r\nhave too much of the animal’s skeleton missing or we may make a serious\r\nerror. But if the left hind leg is missing and we have the right, we are\r\nnot seriously handicapped. However, if both hind legs are missing we\r\nmust restore them according to a similar animal whose hind legs are\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAfter the nearly entire skeleton has been found it must be collected\r\nwith great care. This is a rather involved process and, for some of the\r\nlarge dinosaurs, 2 or 3 months work may be required. The specimen is\r\nfirst uncovered and the fossil bone is treated with a preservative such\r\nas gum arabic, shellac, or one of the plastics. An accurate diagram of\r\nthe specimen as it lies in the rock is made on cross-ruled paper. A\r\ntrench 2 or 3 feet wide is then dug around the specimen. The depth of\r\nthe trench is determined by the width of the specimen and the nature of\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PUTTING PLASTER CAST ON A FOSSIL BEFORE REMOVING IT\r\n    FROM THE QUARRY.]\r\n\r\nIf the specimen is too large to take out in one piece, as most dinosaurs\r\nare, it is divided into sections which are numbered serially as they are\r\ntaken out. Each section is bandaged in strips of burlap dipped in\r\nplaster of Paris. After the plaster has set, the section is turned over\r\nand the bottom is sealed with burlap and plaster. The section is labeled\r\nwith the appropriate number and the section and number are shown on the\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the sections have been bandaged and numbered they are packed\r\nin strong wooden boxes and shipped to the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe work in the laboratory is more involved than that in the field, and\r\nextreme care must be exercised to be sure that the bones will be\r\nundamaged. In most cases the bones have been broken by natural causes as\r\nthey lay in the rock before discovery. All the pieces of each bone must\r\nbe thoroughly cleaned and securely cemented together. This is a very\r\ntime-consuming task and for a large dinosaur like _Apatosaurus_ it\r\nrequires 3 men 4 or 5 years to complete the task.\r\n\r\nAfter all of the bones are cleaned and cemented together the vertebral\r\ncolumn is laid out in its proper sequence on a sand table. Special care\r\nis exercised to be sure that the vertebrae fit correctly with each\r\nother. In this way the correct curvature of the vertebral column is\r\ndetermined. The proper relationships of the hip bones and ribs to the\r\nvertebrae, the shoulder blade to the ribs, and elements of the limb\r\nbones to each other are determined in the same manner. All of this work\r\nis necessary to correctly fashion the steel framework which will support\r\nthe skeleton when it is placed on exhibition. The results of this\r\ncareful work must be the framework of an animal which could, if living,\r\neasily go through the normal activities of life such as securing food\r\nand escaping enemies.\r\n\r\nNow that the framework of an animal has been set up so that it could\r\nmove about if it had muscles, skin, and life, how do we know how large\r\nthe muscles were and where they were placed? It is necessary to have a\r\nthorough knowledge of the muscles of a recent animal similar to the one\r\nwe are restoring so that we will know what we are looking for in the\r\nfossil. The areas at which muscles are attached to bones are called\r\nmuscle scars and are identified by their rough surfaces. Often the\r\nnecessary information can be obtained from publications which usually\r\nrepresent the work done by graduate students for advanced degrees. At\r\nother times we must make our own investigation. Thus if we know what\r\nmuscle we are looking for and the size and shape of its muscle scar, we\r\ncan determine whether the muscle is a spindle-shaped mass or a broad\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nAfter we have determined the size and position of the muscles which\r\noperate the limbs, head, and neck, we have a reasonably accurate idea of\r\nthe external form of the animal, but we still know nothing of the nature\r\nof the skin which covered the body. Since dinosaurs were reptiles, we\r\nare obliged to assume that they were covered with a scaly skin in order\r\nto preserve the body moisture. None of the modern reptiles possess sweat\r\nglands in the skin. If they did not possess a waterproof covering of\r\nscales they would die in a few hours as a result of the loss of body\r\nmoisture by evaporation through the skin. It is possible that some of\r\nthe marsh dwellers like _Apatosaurus_ had naked skin which was, as in\r\nthe elephant, nearly an inch thick. The elephant does not possess sweat\r\nglands but the outer half of its skin is composed entirely of dead cells\r\nwhich form a covering as waterproof as the scales of today’s reptiles.\r\n\r\nThere have been only a few lucky finds of mummified dinosaurs which show\r\nthe impressions of the scales. We know that all lizards do not possess\r\nthe same type of scales, and therefore, by analogy, we cannot assume\r\nthat the dinosaurs did. Eventually, we will probably find that the\r\ndinosaurs exhibited as great a variety of scale-types as do today’s\r\nlizards. As yet we have found nothing in the fossil record which\r\nindicates the color of the dinosaurs. Again, we can only assume that\r\nthey exhibited as great a variety of colors as do our lizards. So also,\r\nwe assume their body functions were somewhat similar to the reptiles and\r\nother related animals we know today.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DINOSAUR FOSSIL WITH SKIN AND LIGAMENTS PRESERVED.\r\n    (NOT FROM DINOSAUR QUARRY. COURTESY, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL\r\n    HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RARE FOSSIL OF DINOSAUR SKIN. (COURTESY, AMERICAN\r\n    MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE\r\n\r\nWe know the body temperatures of reptiles vary with that of the air or\r\nwater in which they live, as they have no means of internal temperature\r\ncontrol. They are very sluggish when their body temperatures are low and\r\nbecome more active as these temperatures rise, but only to a certain\r\npoint. If the body temperatures of reptiles become too high, they die in\r\na few minutes.\r\n\r\nA group of physiologists from Columbia University spent nearly 2 months\r\nin southern Florida experimenting on reptiles. They determined the rate\r\nof rise of body temperatures of large lizards and alligators of all\r\nsizes during exposure to the midday sun. As was expected, the smaller\r\nthe reptile the more rapid the rise in body temperature. Dinosaurs were\r\nreptiles so we can make two assumptions: That their physiology was very\r\nsimilar to that of living reptiles; and that the rate of rise of their\r\nbody temperatures from exposure to the sun would follow the principles\r\nfound for living reptiles.\r\n\r\nBy applying these principles to the dinosaurs, this group of scientists\r\ncalculated that if the great bulk of an _Apatosaurus_ were exposed to\r\nthe direct rays of the sun at an air temperature of 110° F. for 36 to 40\r\nhours, its body temperature would rise only 1° F. Therefore, if these\r\ncalculations are correct, it is probable that the very size of the huge\r\ndinosaurs operated to maintain a fairly constant body temperature.\r\nConsequently, daily and seasonal temperature changes probably did not\r\naffect the activities of the large dinosaurs. However, the activities of\r\nthe small ones may have been affected by the daily range in temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GIZZARD STONES\r\n\r\nFor many years rounded stones with a very high polish have been found in\r\nthe sedimentary rocks which contain bones of extinct reptiles. The\r\npolish on these stones is very much higher than could have been applied\r\nby the action of water or wind. Some look as though they had been\r\npolished by a jeweler. Since we cannot attribute this very high polish\r\nto wind or water action, we must seek another agent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Protiguanodon._ NOTE GIZZARD STONES INSIDE RIB\r\n    BASKET. (COURTESY, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\nJust as chickens swallow fine gravel for their gizzards to aid\r\ndigestion, so it is thought that some large dinosaurs swallowed stones\r\nfor the same purpose. There is some evidence to support this idea.\r\nSeveral specimens of a group of swimming reptiles, called _plesiosaurs_,\r\nwhich swarmed the Jurassic and Cretaceous seas, have been found with\r\nhighly polished stones inside the rib basket. Also a mass of highly\r\npolished stones was found similarly associated with one dinosaur,\r\n_Protiguanodon_, in the Lower Cretaceous rocks of Mongolia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no highly polished stones have been found associated\r\nwith the specimens in the Dinosaur Quarry or anywhere in the quarry. A\r\nsearch of the many publications on dinosaurs has not turned up any\r\nmention of highly polished stones being associated with any of the many\r\nspecimens found in North America. Thus the evidence which we have does\r\nnot permit us to say that the dinosaurs found in the quarry did or did\r\nnot possess gizzard stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Climate, Life, and Landscape of Jurassic Time\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geologists who attempt to reconstruct the geography and climate of\r\nthe Jurassic Period first gather all possible facts and try to fit them\r\ntogether to form a logical pattern. The results are then examined for\r\nweak points and an attempt is made to find field evidence throwing light\r\non these weak points. The final result represents the sum of our\r\nknowledge at the time but is subject to change as new facts are\r\nobtained. Thus the following outline represents present thinking that\r\nmay be changed somewhat by future studies.\r\n\r\nThe land for miles around the Dinosaur Quarry was a low-lying desert in\r\nearly Jurassic time. The mountains you see now had not yet been formed,\r\nand the whole desert area lay close to sea level. Great restless sand\r\ndunes drifted across this level land to form a blanket 700 feet thick.\r\nAs the earth’s crust sank, these dunes were covered by a long arm of an\r\narctic sea that extended southward along the present trend of the Rocky\r\nMountains across Canada, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah. Millions of years\r\nlater, in late Jurassic time, when the Morrison formation was deposited,\r\nthe area rose again and the stage was set for the dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nImagine if you can, the vast plains extending from Mexico to Canada and\r\nfrom central Utah to the Mississippi River. To the west were high\r\nmountains in the Great Basin region of Nevada and western Utah. From\r\nthese highlands flowed great sluggish streams that carried large amounts\r\nof sand and silt. Since the plains were almost flat, swamps and small\r\nlakes were probably numerous. The streams may have changed their courses\r\nfrom time to time as they were not confined to deep valleys. When the\r\nwhole region emerged from the sea the climate became more humid.\r\nVolcanoes were active far to the west; the winds carried clouds of\r\nejected dust eastward and deposited them on the plains. Semi-tropical\r\nconditions probably existed throughout the United States and in parts of\r\nCanada. These deposits are called the Morrison formation.\r\n\r\nThe warm humid climate provided ideal conditions for plant growth. Great\r\nforests of lush vegetation covered the land. Many of these plants have\r\nsince disappeared, but some of their related species may be found today\r\nin the tropics. Most of the plants of our Temperate Zone had not yet\r\nevolved. However, there were tall stands of a type of pine, and other\r\nevergreens. There were also gingkos and curious tree ferns.\r\n\r\nVarious herb ferns formed a ground cover as thick and lush as grass on a\r\nwell-watered prairie. Palmlike ferns resembling today’s cycads were\r\ncommon, while along the river grew horsetail rushes like those living\r\ntoday. Flowering plants of the Recent Epoch of geologic time (in which\r\nwe are now living) had not yet made their appearance. Thus the hardwood,\r\nbroadleaf forests of oak, elm, beech, maple, and similar trees were\r\nabsent. So too were the flowering shrubs familiar to the Temperate Zone.\r\nEven the grasses were missing.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you could picnic in this strange plant world you would soon\r\nbe slapping mosquitos and cursing the ants. For even in such ancient\r\ntimes these insects were present; and so were a great variety of other\r\ninsects as is known from the more than 1,000 species that have been\r\ndiscovered in Jurassic rocks. Among them were representatives of most\r\nmodern orders such as grasshoppers, beetles, moths, ants, and flies.\r\nJurassic insects probably looked much like those of today.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting of the strange reptiles were the pterosaurs\r\nthat dominated the skies. They resembled the modern bats in some ways\r\nbut their leathery wings were supported on each side by one finger\r\ninstead of four, and their skins were scaly or bare instead of hairy.\r\nSome forms had long tails that were flattened at the tip and helped them\r\nbalance in flight, but others were tailless. Some pterosaurs were no\r\nlarger than sparrows while others had wing spans of 3 to 4 feet.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles sunned themselves on the banks of sluggish streams and lakes.\r\nThey probably looked a good deal like those that live in modern swamps\r\nand their habits were similar. Many a small dinosaur fell victim to\r\ntheir stealthy attack and disappeared beneath the waters of some ancient\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nBirds have been found in Upper Jurassic rocks of Germany and may have\r\nlived here too. Their fossil remains would probably have been classed as\r\nreptiles had not feather imprints been a part of them. About the size of\r\ncrows, these reptile-like birds had small conical teeth, three-clawed\r\nfingers on each wing, and a long tail instead of the fan of feathers\r\nseen on modern birds.\r\n\r\nSmall mammals were also living at the time the Morrison formation was\r\nbeing deposited and their remains have been found in the dinosaur quarry\r\nat Como Bluff, Wyo. The largest ones were about the size of a house cat\r\nbut the majority were much smaller, probably about the size of today’s\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nWe do not know much about the habits of these early mammals but they\r\nwere probably rather shy and retiring. This would be expected in the\r\nworld of giants where they lived. Some of them lived in trees and there\r\nwas one group whose skull characteristics resemble those of the rodents.\r\nIt is likely that these primitive mammals lived a life similar to that\r\nof the rodents millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the setting, the stage upon which the dinosaurs played\r\ntheir leading roles. Although we have restricted our discussion to\r\nMorrison time in northeastern Utah, the same or similar animals lived\r\nall over the world. Worldwide humid and mild climates produced a\r\nsimilarity of plant and animal life during most of the Mesozoic Era\r\nwhose like has not been seen in the last 60 million years. It was a\r\nstrange world and ruled by strange animals, but it must have been an\r\ninteresting one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HOW DO WE KNOW?\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to stop and try to explain that this story, of\r\nplants and animals of the past, has a firm foundation in today’s\r\nfacts—it is not a fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which geologists and paleontologists have established the\r\nage, climate, and life of Morrison time cannot be described for you here\r\nin detail. To attempt such a description would require too much space\r\nand would probably seem dull to most readers. Perhaps the best approach\r\nis to describe some features and explain how they contribute to our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe rocks that were deposited here in Morrison time tell us much of the\r\nstory. The sandstones were once stream sandbars or perhaps beaches\r\naround lakes. The shale, siltstone, and clay were muddy stream or lake\r\nbottoms. The discontinuous ledges of conglomerate probably represent\r\ngravel bars formed during flood stages or at places where the stream\r\ncurrents were very swift.\r\n\r\nJust rocks you may say—but look closely. A piece of sandstone contains\r\ngrains of sand that differ from each other in size, shape, and\r\ncomposition. Frequently these characteristics point to the source of the\r\nsandstone and tell something about the conditions at the time it was\r\ndeposited. Chunks of black material are examined closely and prove to be\r\ncharcoal—carbonized remains of plants.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination of clay fragments reveals shards of volcanic\r\nglass and ash that speak of active volcanoes. Sometimes these clays bear\r\nthe carbonized imprints of delicate plants that long ago sank to the\r\nbottom of some lake or stream where they were buried and fossilized.\r\n\r\nThe fossils themselves are most important in reconstructing conditions\r\nof the past. We find the shells of fresh-water clams in the sandstones\r\nwith dinosaur bones. Crocodile bones are also common. We are reasonably\r\nsure, then, that these deposits of sand and mud were formed in rivers\r\nand lakes when the climate was mild.\r\n\r\nWe reason by analogy. For example, fossil plants and animals have\r\ncounterparts or descendants in the world of today. We assume, in the\r\nabsence of contrary evidence, that the fossil animals lived like their\r\npresent-day counterparts. Although no birds, mammals, or pterosaurs have\r\nbeen found in this quarry, they were probably living here with the\r\ndinosaurs. It is possible, in fact probable, that some modern animals\r\nand plants live in different environments than did their Morrison\r\nancestors and relatives but we have no way of knowing which ones they\r\nwere. We can only take the data available, arrange them as logically as\r\npossible, and continue the search for more. Some may scoff at such\r\nmethods of reasoning yet they do provide good results. What other\r\nmethods can be used when the world under investigation lies millions of\r\nyears in the past?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Animals from the Quarry\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the rocks of the Morrison formation at the quarry, both orders of\r\ndinosaurs are found—_Saurischia_ and _Ornithischia_. Paleontologists\r\nhave divided the dinosaurs into these two groups on the basis of\r\nimportant skeletal differences. These differences remain constant for\r\nthe orders and vary within each order only in small details.\r\n\r\nThe important structural difference in dinosaurs is found in the pelvis.\r\nIn all land vertebrates, the pelvis is made up of three pairs of bones\r\ncalled the ilium, pubis, and ischium. The paired ilium is joined to each\r\nside of the backbone and projects downward to meet the pubis and ischium\r\nat the socket for the head of the thigh bone. The pubis forms the front\r\nthird and the ischium the rear third of this socket. In the order\r\n_Saurischia_ the bones of the pelvis are arranged as in most reptiles\r\nand mammals. In the order _Ornithischia_ the pubis extends backward\r\nalong the ischium as it does in the birds.\r\n\r\nTwo types of saurischian dinosaurs are found in the quarry.\r\n_Antrodemus_, a flesh-eating type, was about the size of a horse, but\r\nwas two-footed. It had strong sharp claws on its feet. Its teeth were\r\nabout 2 inches long, flattened from side to side and with fine\r\nserrations on front and back edges. Actually it is not known whether\r\n_Antrodemus_ overpowered and killed the large swamp-living dinosaurs, or\r\nmerely fed on their carcasses after they had died from other causes.\r\nHowever, there has been found in the quarries at Como, Wyo., a partial\r\nskeleton of _Apatosaurus_ with grooves on the bones which suggest tooth\r\nmarks. The spacing of these grooves fit the spacing of the teeth of a\r\nspecimen of _Antrodemus_ found in the same quarry.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. ORNITHISCHIAN PELVIS. B. SAURISCHIAN PELVIS.\r\n    KEY: IL—ILLIUM; IS—ISCHIUM; P—PUBIS.]\r\n\r\nThe plant-eating dinosaurs of the order _Saurischia_ which are found in\r\nthe quarry were all four-footed. They had bodies about the size of an\r\nelephant or larger. The principal differences between the flesh- and\r\nplant-eating dinosaurs were the length of the neck and tail, the details\r\nof their skull structure, and other parts of their skeleton.\r\n\r\n_Apatosaurus_ is perhaps the most familiar dinosaur to most of us. Its\r\nhind legs were much longer than its front ones and gave the animal a\r\nhigh-hipped, stooped appearance. _Apatosaurus_ was about 70 feet long\r\nand probably weighed close to 40 tons. _Diplodocus_ was longer (one of\r\nthem 75½ feet) but was slender and lightly built. Its neck was longer\r\nand it had a whiplash tail that looked much like the tail of the modern\r\nwhiptailed lizard. _Diplodocus_ also had long pencil-like teeth\r\ndifferent from those of any other known dinosaur. _Barosaurus_ has an\r\nextremely long neck with long individual neck bones. Two members of the\r\ngenus _Camarasaurus_ are similar to each other except for size; one was\r\nsmall, but the other was as large as _Apatosaurus_. _Camarasaurus_ had\r\nlonger front legs than _Apatosaurus_ and was generally better\r\nproportioned.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Antrodemus_, THE FEROCIOUS CARNIVORE OF MORRISON\r\n    TIME. (FROM A DRAWING BY CHARLES R. KNIGHT. COURTESY, AMERICAN\r\n    MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE GREAT SAURISCHIAN PLANT-EATER _Apatosaurus\r\n    louisae_—ABOUT 70 FEET LONG. (FROM A DRAWING BY A. AVINOFF, CARNEGIE\r\n    MUSEUM.)]\r\n\r\nFossils of the saurischian plant-eaters are found much more frequently\r\nthan those of flesh-eaters and are usually in sedimentary rocks which\r\ncontain beds of clam shells. For this reason it seems probable that they\r\nwaded lagoons and streams, feeding on aquatic and bank-side vegetation.\r\nThe suggestion has been made that the larger dinosaurs could not even\r\nwalk on dry land because their weight would have crushed the bones of\r\ntheir feet; they needed the buoyancy of water to help support them.\r\nHowever, footprints of a huge dinosaur, much larger than any from the\r\nquarry, have been found near Glenrose, Tex. The large footprints were\r\nmade on a sandy beach of a sea in Lower Cretaceous time. Thus we know\r\nthat they could walk on dry land if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nAll of the dinosaurs of the order _Ornithischia_ were plant-eaters, and\r\nwere of both two- and four-footed types. The two-footed types found in\r\nthe quarry are _Camptosaurus_, _Dryosaurus_, and _Laosaurus_. These\r\nforms had well developed front legs, though much shorter than their hind\r\nlegs, which suggests that they may have dropped down on “all fours”\r\nwhile feeding or resting. The teeth were small, chisel-shaped, and\r\nfitted only for cropping vegetation. The larger specimens of\r\n_Camptosaurus_ reached a length of 17 feet but _Laosaurus_ was only 2½\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\n_Stegosaurus_ is the only quadruped (four-footed) of this order found in\r\nthe quarry. It had long hind legs and very short front legs. It reached\r\na length of 18 to 20 feet and was 10 to 11 feet high over the hips. The\r\nmost characteristic feature of this form was the double row of bony\r\nplates down the back and the group of spikes at the end of the tail. The\r\nteeth were similar to those of _Camptosaurus_, but much more numerous.\r\n\r\nOnly two other groups of reptiles have been found in the quarry at\r\nDinosaur National Monument and their remains are rare. These are the\r\ncrocodiles and turtles. Two crocodiles are known; the larger one,\r\n_Goniopholis_, was about the size of existing alligators and did not\r\ndiffer in external appearance from present-day crocodiles. The smaller\r\none was less than a foot long and resembled a 2 weeks’ old alligator as\r\nmuch as anything. However, we know from the texture of the surface of\r\nthe bone that it was not a young animal. The turtle, _Glyptops_, was\r\nabout the same size and general appearance as the pond turtles of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WHY SO MANY?\r\n\r\nThe partial skeletons of more than 20 individual dinosaurs and the\r\nscattered bones of about 300 more have been discovered in the Dinosaur\r\nQuarry. Many of the best specimens may be seen today at museums of\r\nnatural history in the larger cities of the United States and Canada.\r\nThe quarry is easily the largest and best preserved deposit of Jurassic\r\ndinosaurs known today.\r\n\r\nHow and why did so many dinosaur skeletons accumulate here? How were\r\nthey preserved? These are among the common questions asked of park\r\nrangers and naturalists at Dinosaur. The answer is a combination of\r\ncircumstances and luck.\r\n\r\nMany people get the impression from the mass of bones in the quarry wall\r\nthat some catastrophe such as a volcanic explosion or a sudden flood\r\nkilled a whole herd of dinosaurs in this area. True enough this could\r\nhave happened, but it probably did not. The main reasons for thinking\r\notherwise are the scattered bones and the thickness of the deposit. In\r\nother deposits where the animals were thought to have died together, the\r\nskeletons were usually complete and often all the bones were in their\r\nproper positions, or articulated. In a mass killing the bones would have\r\nbeen deposited on the stream or lake bottom together at the same level,\r\nbut in this deposit the bones occur throughout a zone of sandstone about\r\n12 feet thick. The mixture of swamp dwellers and dry-land types also\r\nseems to indicate that the deposit is a mixture derived from different\r\nsources. Rounded fragments of fossil bone have been discovered in the\r\nquarry—fragments that attained their pebblelike shape by rolling along\r\nthe stream bottom.\r\n\r\nIf the mass of bones was not the result of catastrophe what did happen?\r\nThe quarry area is a dinosaur graveyard, not a place where they died. A\r\nmajority of the remains probably floated down an eastward flowing river\r\nuntil they were stranded on a shallow sandbar. Some of them, such as the\r\nstegosaurs, may have come from far-away dryland areas to the west.\r\nPerhaps they drowned trying to ford a tributary stream or were washed\r\naway during floods. Some of the swamp dwellers may have mired down on\r\nthe very sandbar that became their grave while others may have floated\r\nfor miles before being stranded.\r\n\r\nEven today similar events take place. When floods come in the spring,\r\nsheep, cattle, and deer are often trapped by rising waters and\r\nfrequently drown. Their bloated carcasses float downstream until the\r\nflood recedes and leaves them stranded on a bar or shore where they lie,\r\nfrequently half buried in the sand, until they decompose. Early\r\ntravelers on the Missouri River reported that shores and bars were\r\nfrequently lined with the decomposing bodies of bison that had perished\r\nduring spring floods.\r\n\r\nIn Dinosaur National Monument, the positions in which partial skeletons\r\nof the dinosaurs lie suggest that they decomposed on a sandbar. The\r\nbones on the underside of a skeleton are often arranged as they were\r\nwhen the animal was alive, while those on the upper or exposed side may\r\nbe scattered. Such scattering would be expected as the ligaments and\r\nmuscles holding the bones together decomposed; stream currents and\r\nscavengers could then disperse them. Stream currents are suggested by\r\nthe position of the long, flexible tails and necks of the large plant\r\nfeeders. These, like streaming water plants in a river, trail downstream\r\nto the east.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Camptosaurus_—AN ARNITHISCHIAN PLANT-EATER. (DRAWN\r\n    BY J. G. GERMAN. COURTESY, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HOW WERE THEY PRESERVED?\r\n\r\nThe concentration and burial of dinosaur bones is only the beginning of\r\nthe fossil story. The combination of circumstances which operated here\r\nwas a common one and yet fossil quarries are rare. Why? The bones have\r\nto be preserved and this seldom happens. The bones that are buried in\r\none flood are frequently unearthed and scattered by the next. Those that\r\nare exposed to the weather usually disintegrate completely in a few\r\nyears. The bones in the Dinosaur Quarry did not.\r\n\r\nSometime after they were buried, the organic minerals of the bones were\r\nmore or less completely replaced by minerals of inorganic origin such as\r\nsilica. No one knows exactly why or how this happened, but it did. Most\r\ngeologists think this replacement process occurs when subsurface or\r\nground water containing soluble and colloidal minerals dissolves a\r\nmolecule of the bone and immediately replaces it with a new mineral.\r\nRoughly such a process is like removing red bricks from a house and\r\nsubstituting yellow. When the substitution is complete, the house still\r\nhas the same dimensions but it is composed of different materials. The\r\nreplacement was a faithful one, too, because microscopic structure of\r\nthe original bone was faithfully reproduced by the replacing minerals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROAD MAP\r\n    DINOSAUR\r\n    NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n    UTAH - COLORADO\r\n    High-resolution Map]\r\n\r\nFollowing Morrison time, thousands of feet of younger sediments were\r\ndeposited on the sandbar that contained the dinosaur bones. The whole\r\nsequence of sediments was compacted into rock and some bones were\r\ncrushed and distorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HOW WERE THEY EXPOSED?\r\n\r\nAfter the sediments became rock and the bones had probably been replaced\r\nby stone (fossilized), this part of the world, which lay near or below\r\nsea level for millions of years, began to rise. Great forces acted upon\r\nthe earth’s crust. These forces created faults, or fractures, in the\r\nrock crust along which movement occurred. And what had once been sea\r\nbottom was moved upward and became lofty mountains. This titanic change\r\nhas been called the Laramide Revolution; it closed the Mesozoic Era with\r\nthe formation of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Stegosaurus._ AN ARMORED DINOSAUR OF THE JURASSIC\r\n    PERIOD. (FROM A DRAWING BY CHARLES R. KNIGHT. COURTESY, AMERICAN\r\n    MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough the effects of the Laramide Revolution were not as profound at\r\nDinosaur as they were east of it, they were quite important. The rocks\r\nwere lifted to form the southwest flank of Split Mountain—a small arch,\r\nor anticline, on the south side of the Uinta Mountains. This mountain\r\nbuilding explains the pronounced southward tilt of the Dinosaur Ledge\r\nand other rock layers visible in the quarry area. As the land rose,\r\nstreams flowed more rapidly, cutting deeper into the rocks and carrying\r\naway the debris. Gradually thousands of feet of this debris—shale,\r\nsandstone, and clay—were stripped away through erosion.\r\n\r\nFinally all the material on top of the Morrison sandbar weathered away.\r\nSome 140 million years after burial the fossil bones were exposed by the\r\nagent that had buried them so long ago—running water! All that remained\r\nwas for them to be found, and that was the luckiest chance of all. Just\r\nsuppose they had been uncovered a million years ago—only a second in\r\ngeologic time. No one would have been present to discover them, and\r\nthrough the years they could well have crumbled into dust and been blown\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Why Did Dinosaurs Become Extinct?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Dinosaur National Monument only Morrison rocks of the upper Jurassic\r\nPeriod contain the fossil bones of dinosaurs. After Morrison time, the\r\nCretaceous seas invaded this area. More than 5,000 feet of sandstone,\r\nshale, and mudstone were formed from sediments deposited in these seas.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in North America and the rest of the world, the diversity and\r\nnumbers of dinosaurs actually increased. Entirely new groups evolved and\r\nachieved success in the battle for survival. The climax of reptile\r\ndevelopment seems to have come near the end of Cretaceous time in the\r\nMesozoic Era. As the dinosaurs ruled the continents, so did other\r\nstrange reptiles dominate the seas. Had you been able to see this\r\nancient world, you would surely have been convinced that the dinosaurs\r\nand other reptiles would rule forever.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be. The dinosaur hordes were wiped out and the\r\nreptiles reduced to the position of relative insignificance they occupy\r\ntoday. Such a profound and sudden change in the evolutionary trend of\r\nlife must have had a cause, and scientists have sought it. Several\r\ntheories have been proposed to explain extinction of dinosaurs, and they\r\nare most interesting.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Cretaceous time, some of our great mountain ranges were\r\nformed. It was a time of earthquakes and of volcanoes that belched forth\r\nclouds of ash and rivers of molten rock. Some people would say these\r\ncatastrophic events killed all the dinosaurs. The scientist shakes his\r\nhead. If these events killed dinosaurs, why not the other animals that\r\nlived with the dinosaurs. And what of those parts of the world that had\r\nno volcanoes, what killed dinosaurs there?\r\n\r\nChanges in environments, the drainage of lakes and swamps as young\r\nmountains rose, changes in vegetation as new plants replaced old, and\r\nsudden shifts of climate occurred. These conditions could explain local\r\nextinction, but there were places where these changes did not occur and\r\nyet all dinosaurs in all places died.\r\n\r\nA one-time favorite theory suggested that increasing numbers of small\r\nmammals ate dinosaur eggs, but there were many mammals eating dinosaur\r\neggs during all of Cretaceous time and the dinosaur hordes increased.\r\nMany more mammals during succeeding ages have not killed off the\r\nturtles, snakes, lizards, and crocodiles that lay eggs and exist in\r\ngreat numbers today.\r\n\r\nSome disease or combination of plagues may have swept the dinosaurs into\r\nextinction. If so, no evidence has been found to date that confirms or\r\ndenies. However, most paleontologists do not accept this theory.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the theories that have been advanced to explain the\r\nsudden extinction of dinosaurs throughout the world. Each theory will\r\nexplain the death of some dinosaurs in some places but attempts to apply\r\nany of them, or combinations of them, to worldwide extinction have\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThis dinosaur story is like a mystery thriller with the last pages torn\r\nout. A most important part is missing. That is true and the\r\npaleontologist knows it. He also knows the riddle will probably never be\r\nsolved. He might point out, however, that no one has successfully\r\nexplained the extinction of the passenger pigeon which occurred quite\r\nrecently, nor do we know why some other species of wildlife are on the\r\nbrink of extinction today. The paleontologist is not the only one who\r\nmust say, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 History and Development of the Quarry\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DISCOVERY AND EARLY YEARS\r\n\r\nNo one knows how long the old bones had been weathering out of the hills\r\nof what is now Dinosaur National Monument before the first man saw them.\r\nCurious Indians, wandering between the upturned ridges of Mesozoic\r\nrocks, picked up fragments and carried them off to their camps where\r\nthey are now found among the arrow points, ax heads, and corn-grinding\r\nstones. In 1776, the Spaniard, Father Escalante, passed within sight of\r\ntoday’s dinosaur quarry, not dreaming of the antiquity hidden there.\r\nMaj. John Wesley Powell, on his second voyage down the Green River in\r\n1871, recorded the presence of “reptilian remains” in the area, but\r\nwrote nothing more about them. Sheepherders, cattlemen, and hunters\r\nobserved them and were impressed in proportion to their understanding.\r\nBut, through all the years, the nature of the bones remained a mystery.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EARL DOUGLASS, DISCOVERER OF THE DINOSAUR QUARRY.]\r\n\r\nThen, in 1893, this mystery was solved. O. A. Peterson, a scientist from\r\nthe American Museum of Natural History, while conducting field work in\r\nthe Uinta Basin to the south of the present monument boundaries,\r\ndiscovered bones out-cropping from a recognized fossil-bearing stratum.\r\nThe stratum was the 140,000,000 year-old Morrison formation. The bones?\r\nPeterson reported them as the remains of dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nThat report was to have an important influence, 15 years later, in\r\ndirecting a fellow paleontologist from the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh\r\nto investigate the area. Earl Douglass was the paleontologist’s name. In\r\n1908, he and W. J. Holland, Director of the Carnegie Museum, found\r\nthemselves in the region of Peterson’s discovery, searching for dinosaur\r\nremains. They extended their search to the north and thence along the\r\nMorrison hogback that flanks Split Mountain. Bone was found—not much,\r\nbut enough to bring Douglass back the following summer and in company\r\nwith George Goodrich, a local resident, to pursue the hunt.\r\n\r\nThe hunt came to a triumphant climax on August 17, 1909, when—to quote\r\nfrom Douglass’s diary—“At last in the top of the ledge where the softer\r\noverlying beds form a divide ... I saw eight of the tail bones of a\r\n_Brontosaurus {Apatosaurus}_ in exact position.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STARTING THE QUARRY\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning—the beginning of the celebrated dinosaur quarry\r\nwhich was to yield such a multitude and variety of ancient forms to\r\nscience, and eventually lead to the establishment of Dinosaur National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nDouglass proceeded to dig into the solid rock along those original eight\r\ntail bones and found other parts of the skeleton. In time, the almost\r\ncomplete frame of the _Apatosaurus_ was exposed. The skull was missing\r\nand parts of the limb bones, but this was to be expected, as fossil\r\nvertebrates are rarely preserved in their entirety. What was not\r\nexpected were the remains of a smaller dinosaur comingled with those of\r\nits huge contemporary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   EXTENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIND\r\n\r\nDouglass was elated. This was more than a “one strike”! How much more,\r\nonly further digging would tell. Sensing a large-scale operation, he\r\ninformed the Carnegie Museum of his prospects and readied things with\r\nthe intensity of a man at the gate of destiny. From the neighboring\r\nranches he recruited men, horses, and equipment. He sent for his wife\r\nand child. He constructed a road to the discovery site, built a\r\nfive-room cabin out of logs and lumber, converted a sheepherder’s camp\r\nwagon into an office, selected ground for future planting, bought a cow.\r\nA forge was set up. Tools were purchased.\r\n\r\nBack at the museum, Andrew Carnegie, himself, evinced interest. He had\r\nalways wanted something “as big as a barn” for his institution. A\r\nspecial annual field fund of $5,000 was added to the regular budget to\r\ncarry on the work.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, Douglass and his men had run a cut over a hundred feet\r\nlong in the hard sandstone, digging down along the almost perpendicular\r\nslant of the rock. At the base of this, rails were laid and small mine\r\ncarts introduced to haul away the cuttings from the rapidly developing\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nNew specimens appeared: A small plant-eating dinosaur known as\r\n_Dryosaurus_; an armored form called _Stegosaurus_; and another large\r\ncreature like the _Apatosaurus_. Best of all, the _Apatosaurus_ No. 1\r\nwas well on its way out of the rock and would soon be ready to ship to\r\nthe Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “...

COGGESHALL.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1913, after 3 years of laboratory work in the Carnegie Museum the big\r\n_Apatosaurus_ was on its feet in the Hall of Vertebrate Paleontology—1\r\nof the 4 mounted specimens of this genus in the country and the most\r\nperfect of all. Prepared and erected by Arthur S. Coggeshall and his\r\nassociates, it measures 71½ feet long and stands 15 feet tall at the\r\narch of the back.\r\n\r\nAs the excavating progressed it was not long before the diggings became\r\nwhat is known to the profession as a “general quarry.” Dinosaurs of “all\r\nkinds and sizes” were showing up. Other quarries of this type had been\r\ndeveloped in previous years in the Morrison formation at Como Bluff,\r\nWyo., and Canon City, Colo., but they contained nothing like the variety\r\nof forms found here. Moreover, these at the monument were better\r\npreserved and the skeletons more intact.\r\n\r\nThe remains most frequently encountered in the diggings were those of\r\nsauropods—the huge plant-feeding dinosaurs with long tapering\r\nextremities that lumbered about on four pillar-like legs. _Camarasaurus_\r\nand the larger _Apatosaurus_ were typical members of this group, and\r\ntheir numerous bones show them as being common animals of their time.\r\n\r\nMore common were the _Diplodoci_, of the exaggerated neck and even\r\nlonger whiplash tail. This genus distinguished itself by producing not\r\nonly the largest amount of skeletal material from the quarry, but also\r\nthe largest number of skulls—those rarest of fossils. One skull was\r\nfound in exact position with the neck bones, which settled all doubts as\r\nto the details of this animal’s head piece. The longest _Diplodocus_ to\r\ncome from the monument extended 75½ feet.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the diminutive _Laosaurus_, a 2½-foot biped which\r\nranks as the smallest dinosaur yet taken from the deposit. This tiny\r\ncreature had hollow limb bones and was one of the agile, quick-running\r\ntypes. Only one was found. When discovered, Douglass thought it a “baby”\r\ndinosaur, but study proved it to be a full-grown specimen. The condition\r\nof the skeleton reflected considerable agitation before and after\r\nburial. It lay on its back, the limbs distended. The tail was gone and\r\nthe skull crushed.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, the most interesting dinosaur found was the sauropod,\r\n_Barosaurus_. It was an extremely long-necked form, some of the\r\nindividual cervical vertebrae measuring 3 feet in length. Two specimens\r\nwere excavated.\r\n\r\nThe flesh-eaters, as might be expected from their scarcity in other\r\nlocalities, made but a small showing. Two specimens of _Antrodemus_ were\r\nunearthed. Thirty feet long, this animal was the ranking predator of its\r\nday, although hardly comparable to the towering _Tyrannosaurus_ that\r\nentered upon the earthly scene at a later age.\r\n\r\n_Stegosaurus_ remains—so abundant that Douglass grew tired of them—added\r\na bizarre note. An armored form, it was equipped with a frill of bony\r\nplates that extended the length of the back and terminated in a pair of\r\nsharp spines. Its chief claim to fame rests in its supposed two sets of\r\n“brains,” one a motor-control center situated in the hip region, and the\r\nother in the usual place.\r\n\r\nEverywhere they dug, the excavators found fresh material—a vast jumble\r\nof bones so concentrated and intermingled as to make it difficult to\r\ndistinguish one specimen from another. Douglass was amazed. Obviously,\r\nit was not with animals of a single area that he was dealing, but of an\r\nentire region. He was dealing with a dinosaur _fauna_. He was also\r\nperplexed. How did so many different types happen to occur in one small\r\nlocality?\r\n\r\nSlowly, as Douglass’s acquaintance with the deposit grew, the answer\r\ncame. It was, he reasoned, the work of a river. The sandstones were\r\nancient sediments. In their structure and composition lay the story of\r\nswift swirling currents. The coarse granular texture told of fast water;\r\nthe crossbedding, of shifting channels; the grouping of the bones into\r\nclusters, of eddies.\r\n\r\nIt all added up to an old delta deposit at the mouth of a river, a\r\nregion of bars where the carcasses of dinosaurs brought down stream\r\naccumulated. Settling, the great hulks became buried as they sank into\r\nthe receptive sand. A number of carcasses multiplied ... and slowly, as\r\nflesh and ligament decayed, the bones became mingled, eventually to\r\npetrify and remain preserved through the ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WORK METHODS\r\n\r\nAt the quarry, excavating continued summer and winter. The methods\r\nemployed were those that paleontologists had used for decades. There was\r\nno compressed air, no labor-saving devices. The work was done by hand.\r\nThe crew, which seldom exceeded four men at any one time, became\r\nveterans in the art of fossil extraction. The bone was brittle; the\r\nencasing sandstone, hard. It required toil, patient direction, and a\r\nknowledge of anatomy.\r\n\r\nJudiciously placed charges of giant powder shattered the overburden.\r\nHand drills, wedge-and-feather, and crowbar worked the rock away, until\r\nthe bone layer was encountered. The slow attrition by hammer and chisel\r\naccomplished the final delicate separation of the remains from the\r\nenclosing matrix. Team-and-scraper and small handcarts removed the\r\nrubble that swiftly accumulated in the cut. As the bones were chiseled\r\nfrom the quarry face in large blocks of rock, they were encased in\r\nstrips of burlap dipped in flour paste. (Later, plaster of Paris\r\nsupplanted the flour paste.) Then they were lowered by rope onto a\r\nmule-drawn skid and “snaked” down the trail into the gulch to await\r\nboxing.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REMOVING A LARGE THIGH BONE FROM THE QUARRY WALL\r\n    DURING THE CARNEGIE MUSEUM OPERATIONS. (COURTESY, A. S.\r\n    COGGESHALL.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLASTERED SPECIMEN REMOVED FROM THE QUARRY DURING THE\r\n    CARNEGIE MUSEUM OPERATIONS. (COURTESY, A. S. COGGESHALL.)]\r\n\r\nTransporting the fossils from quarry to railhead was a major\r\nundertaking. It required wagon trains—4-horse teams hauling high-wheeled\r\nfreight wagons over 60 miles of rutted roads to Dragon, Utah. There the\r\nprecious goods were loaded onto boxcars of the now abandoned narrow\r\ngauge Uintah Railway, later to be transhipped to the standard gauge\r\nDenver & Rio Grande line at Mack, Colo.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FURTHER DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nSpecimens continued to show in record abundance, most of them\r\nduplicating the earlier finds of _Diplodocus_ and _Stegosaurus_. But\r\nthere were new forms, too. One of them was a _Camptosaurus_, the first\r\nto be found at the quarry. It was a modified biped of plant-eating\r\nhabits, a little more than 10 feet long, with its skull and part of the\r\ntail missing.\r\n\r\nBy 1921 the deposit had been worked to a length of 400 feet east and\r\nwest, and to a depth of about 60 feet. Rock was being stripped from the\r\nquarry face at the rate of approximately 20,000 cubic feet annually, and\r\nthe chisels of Douglass and his men had penetrated to the richest\r\nbone-bearing zone.\r\n\r\nIn the following year they uncovered one of the most perfect skeletons\r\nof a dinosaur ever exhumed. It was a small sauropod named, _Camarasaurus\r\nlentus_. When found, its 17-foot vertebral column was practically\r\nintact, except for a few tail segments. The skull was in place, and the\r\nlimbs in their approximate positions.\r\n\r\nIt was an important find scientifically. The position of the limbs gave\r\nclear evidence of the manner in which these animals carried themselves.\r\nThe articulation between the thigh bone and the pelvis showed\r\nconclusively that sauropods walked with their legs more-or-less vertical\r\nto the body and not with the bowed-out crawling posture habitual to\r\nlizards, as many scientists had supposed. The skull was the finest known\r\nfor this genus. It was complete even to the sclerotic ring—a complex of\r\nbony plates which surrounded the living eye and protected it.\r\n\r\nAs exhibit material it was without rival. It was mounted as found, lying\r\non its side, the bones fixed in death in the matrix in which they had\r\nbeen preserved—a fitting climax to the 13 consecutive years that had\r\nseen an unknown sandstone ridge in Utah become Dinosaur National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nIn those 13 years the Carnegie Museum had taken from the quarry parts of\r\n300 dinosaur specimens, 2 dozen of which were mountable skeletons. Ten\r\ndifferent species were represented. It was the best collection of Middle\r\nMesozoic monsters in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the years that immediately followed, the still-rich “dig” was worked\r\nby two other organizations—the Smithsonian Institution and the\r\nUniversity of Utah.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Camarasaurus_ SKELETON—THE MOST PERFECT REMOVED FROM\r\n    THE QUARRY. (COURTESY, CARNEGIE MUSEUM.)]\r\n\r\nBut finally the museums had reaped their harvest. The fruits of the\r\nharvest had gone to enrich many of their finest displays. However, still\r\nburied in the untouched part of the wall were the remains of still more\r\ndinosaurs. All that was needed was to reveal them. The 67° tilt of the\r\nrock made it a perfect exhibit face. Strip off the overlying layers,\r\nexpose the skeletons, and relief them in place. This had been Douglass’s\r\nidea as far back as 1915, when he recorded it in his diary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PROTECTING THE QUARRY\r\n\r\nBut Douglass was not the only one to realize the necessity of preserving\r\nthis unique fossil record of the dinosaurs for people of today and the\r\nfuture to see on the spot. Officials of the Carnegie Museum realized the\r\nextraordinary nature of the deposits and their contribution to our\r\nknowledge of the past; and they were not long in taking steps to protect\r\nthe dinosaur quarry. To preserve it for science, they sought to lay\r\nclaim to it as a mineral property. But their claim was disallowed by the\r\nU. S. Department of the Interior, because fossil bones could not be\r\nclassed as a mineral within the meaning of the mining laws.\r\n\r\nThe museum pressed its case, this time with results—but not what they\r\nexpected. The outcome was not the establishment of a mere mineral claim,\r\nbut of a national monument. Under the provisions of the Antiquities Act,\r\nto safeguard and preserve objects and areas of significant scientific or\r\nhistoric interest, the dinosaur quarry and 80 acres of surrounding land\r\nwere declared a national monument on October 4, 1915. Less than a year\r\nlater it was included in the newly created National Park System.\r\n\r\nSeveral things contributed notably to this action to protect the quarry.\r\nThey were: the exceptional preservation of the bones; the number,\r\nvariety and completeness of the skeletons; the relative abundance of\r\nskulls, consisting of 8 or more in a complete state, and about an equal\r\nnumber of incomplete ones; and the finding of the first complete tails.\r\n\r\nIn 1923, knowing that the quarry was protected, and that the scientific\r\ncollection of the fossil bones for museum exhibit was at an end, Earl\r\nDouglass turned again to the idea of making a perfected exhibit of the\r\nfossils right where they lie. His letter to Dr. Walcott, secretary of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, reads, in part, “I hope that the\r\nGovernment, for the benefit of science and the people, will uncover a\r\nlarge area, leave the bones and skeletons in relief and house them in.\r\nIt would make one of the most astounding and instructive sights\r\nimaginable.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ARCHITECT’S DRAWING OF VISITOR CENTER AT QUARRY\r\n    SITE.]\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what the Government had in mind and, through the\r\nagency of the National Park Service, intended to accomplish. Plans for\r\nan in-place exhibit were drawn up. But many years were to elapse before\r\nthe plans passed from blueprint into reality.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the quarry entered the second phase of its existence, a\r\ndormant period from a scientific viewpoint, but one in which the forces\r\nof the future gathered ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930’s the monument served as a transient camp. A. C. Boyle\r\nwas installed as resident geologist and custodian for the Park Service.\r\nUnder his guidance a program for the general development of the area was\r\ncarried on, financed largely by WPA funds. This entailed, among other\r\nthings, the deepening and widening of the quarry cut, and the\r\nconstruction of buildings later to accommodate the monument staff and\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nThe American Museum of Natural History became interested in the\r\ndevelopment at this time and, through its curator of fossil reptiles,\r\nBarnum Brown, sought to initiate a joint effort with the Park Service\r\nfor exhibiting the quarry remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRESENT DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIt was not until September 1953 that the years of Park Service planning\r\nbore fruit, and the work of developing an in-place exhibit for the\r\nmonument was begun. Many factors operated to spring the project into\r\nbeing, not the least of which was the active interest and wholehearted\r\nsupport of Horace M. Albright, a former Director of the Service.\r\n\r\nTheodore E. White, formerly with the Smithsonian Institution and with\r\nHarvard University, was placed in immediate charge, under the\r\nsupervision of Jess H. Lombard, the superintendent of the National\r\nMonument. His task, and that of his associates, was to expose the\r\nremaining specimens in the quarry wall and work them out in bas-relief.\r\n\r\nA shelter had been built over the working space and power tools were\r\nintroduced for the first time. Using compressed air, the rock was scaled\r\noff with jackhammers and “paving-breakers,” until most of the overburden\r\nhad been removed. Subsequent probing into the bone layer was done with\r\nsmaller chipping hammers, mallet, and chisel. This operation continued\r\nthrough 1954 and 1955 as, slowly and carefully, the extent of the\r\nskeletal material was determined. It comprised parts of several large\r\ndinosaurs, sufficient in quantity to justify the next step—the\r\nconstruction of a building to enclose the quarry face.\r\n\r\nErection of this unusual structure, the first of its design to be\r\nattempted, commenced in 1957 and it was opened to the public in the\r\nfollowing year. Now, as one of the many development projects in its\r\nMISSION 66 program, the National Park Service has resumed the delicate\r\nwork of uncovering this corner of the ancient world and preserving it\r\nin-place for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Scene Today\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you stand at the overlook, you will see the Green River, Split\r\nMountain, and a rolling plain to the south that stretches to a hazy line\r\nof mountains. To many, it is an unfamiliar land that lies strangely\r\nsubdued beneath a blazing sun and an intensely blue sky.\r\n\r\nThat blue sky is the key to the kinds of plants and animals that live in\r\nthis part of the monument. They live most of their lives under blue sky,\r\nand, even when clouds do form over the mountains and drift across the\r\nlowlands, the results are disappointing. A high wind, dust and sand, a\r\nfew drops of rain, and the storm is over.\r\n\r\nThe climatic conditions under which local plants and animals live are\r\nconditions of extremes. On summer days the temperatures may rise above\r\n100°, although the nights are usually cool. During the winter,\r\ntemperatures may skid to 30° below zero or more. It is not uncommon for\r\nthe thermometer to remain below zero for weeks on end. But the most\r\ninfluential climatic factor is water—and there is little of it. The\r\ntotal yearly precipitation is a little less than 8 inches! It is\r\ninteresting then to find such a wide variety of plants and animals that\r\nnot only survive but flourish under such rigorous conditions.\r\n\r\nThe methods used by plants in adapting to arid conditions are\r\ninteresting and varied. The wide-spreading, shallow root system and\r\nthick stem of the cactus enhance collection and storage of water. These\r\nstrange plants are quite plump with stored water in the spring when the\r\nsnows melt, but they gradually lose this plumpness during the dry\r\nsummer, and by autumn many seem lifeless.\r\n\r\nOther plants conserve their water by minimizing the loss through their\r\nleaves. This may be done in a number of ways. The leaves of the spiny\r\ngreasewood are covered with a waxy substance that inhibits water loss\r\nwhile the leaves of the sagebrush are covered with hairs or fuzz that\r\nserve the same function. The leaves of the juniper are scale-like and\r\nreally don’t look like leaves at all. The most direct method of\r\npreventing water loss through leaves is to drop the leaves themselves,\r\nand this method is used to a greater or lesser degree by many desert\r\nplants. The serviceberry is a good example of this method. In late\r\nsummer it looks dead, and yet the following spring finds it robed in\r\ngreen and covered with flowers.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the frugal habits of the plants just described, the\r\ncottonwoods seem lavish indeed. Usually big trees, they spread a canopy\r\nof green in whose shade rest birds and animals alike. Have you ever\r\nrested under a cottonwood? If so, you will remember it as being cool\r\neven on the hottest days. Part of the coolness was due to the hundreds\r\nof gallons of water which are transpired through the leaves each day.\r\nBecause cottonwoods require so much water, they usually grow along\r\nstreams or near springs. Frequently they are seen along dry ravines\r\nwhere their thirsty roots tap the subsurface drainage that lies hidden\r\nbelow. Like the other plants however, when the supply of water becomes\r\ninadequate they shed their leaves and wait for the next spring. Fast\r\ngrowing, usually of large size, and wasteful of water where water is\r\ndear, the cottonwood seldom lives two hundred years while the twisted\r\njuniper on the dry, rocky ledge frequently lives as much as five\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPLIT MOUNTAIN GORGE.]\r\n\r\nInconspicuous through most of the year are the flowering plants. Some of\r\nthese are annuals—plants that grow from seeds, mature, bloom, produce\r\nseeds, and die in the span of a few short weeks. When the snows melt and\r\nthe sun warms the earth, the seeds that survived the winter germinate.\r\nThe usually barren hillsides produce spots of green that soon spread to\r\nform patches as more and more plants mature. Lupine and locoweed are\r\npurple and heliotrope splashes color along the roads, while the\r\nfragrant, white, evening-primrose dots the sandy hillside. Scarlet gilia\r\nand Indian paintbrush add a touch of red to the scene, and orange is\r\nprovided by the mallow.\r\n\r\nApril, May, and early June provide the best flower show as spring rains\r\nsupplement the moisture from melted snow. Their races won, their seeds\r\nproduced, the annuals wither and fade away as the temperatures rise. By\r\nthe first of July little remains of the splendid show.\r\n\r\nTwo plants do brighten the desert scene in August and September. Most\r\ncommon is the rabbitbrush, a plant that grows almost everywhere. It is\r\nrather inconspicuous except in late summer when its brilliant yellow\r\nblossoms turn the whole shrub golden. The other is the bee plant of\r\nwhich there are two species: one has yellow blossoms, and the other has\r\npurple. These tall plants grow along washes, stream courses, roads, and\r\nirrigation ditches. Their delicate blossoms are always surrounded by\r\ninsects drawn by the nectar the flowers produce in great quantities.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are a few of the typical plants. Each has adjusted its\r\nneeds to those limiting factors—winter cold, summer heat, and aridity. A\r\ngreat number of plants grow on the monument that have not been mentioned\r\nhere, but they are like the typical plants and have similar ways of\r\nmeeting the problems of survival.\r\n\r\nMany people who profess an interest in nature admit they cannot get very\r\nexcited about plants. Such disinterest may result in minimizing the\r\nimportance of plants in the general scheme of nature. That would be a\r\nmajor error. The plants of the world are the foundation upon which other\r\nforms of life are dependent. They alone are able to utilize the minerals\r\nin the soil and convert carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates.\r\nBecause of these abilities, the parade of life has been able to advance\r\nonly when the plants advance. In the present as in the past, the kinds\r\nand abundance of plants set definite limits as to the species and\r\nnumbers of animals an area may support. Thus, if man changes the plants\r\nof an area he will surely change the animals too, whether he realizes it\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nIf you drive to the quarry in the heat of the day you will see only a\r\nfew of the birds that live here. They don’t like to hunt their food\r\nduring those hot hours. Frequently a turkey vulture sails majestically\r\nabove the plains along the Green River. Sometimes so high he appears to\r\nbe a speck, his telescopic eye searches the ground for the carrion upon\r\nwhich he feeds. Another bird that does not mind the heat is Say’s\r\nphoebe. He is usually found perched on a fence post, a wire, or a dead\r\nbranch waiting for some insect to buzz by. A graceful, short flight, a\r\npop of his beak, and then back to his perch to repeat the cycle again.\r\nAs he sits motionless, his gray breast and darker gray head and back\r\nmake him hard to see.\r\n\r\nThe time to watch birds is in the evening; as the sun sinks and the air\r\ncools, they come forth. Small gray-brown rock wrens hop among the\r\nboulders near the visitor center. Robins scurry through the leaves in\r\nthe stream course below the Dinosaur Quarry. Here too, western\r\nflycatchers and Audubon’s warblers search among the cottonwoods for\r\ninsects. A flash of red and white is seen as a red-shafted flicker darts\r\nfrom its nest in the hollow trunk of a tree. The sky is filled with\r\nwheeling, twittering rough-winged swallows and white-throated swifts\r\nthat descend from their nests on the cliffs to feed upon the gnats and\r\nother flying insects.\r\n\r\nThese are the birds that spend the spring and summer here. They raise\r\ntheir families and, young and old alike, depart in autumn when frost\r\nkills the insects upon which they feed. As they flee the cold of winter,\r\nthey are joined by many other birds that make their summer homes at\r\nhigher elevations or more northern latitudes. Ducks, geese, and swans\r\njoin the hordes moving southward. So do the various shore birds,\r\nbluebirds, and hummingbirds.\r\n\r\nBut the sagebrush flats and brushy ravines are not left vacant by this\r\nwholesale migration, for as the summer residents move out the winter\r\nresidents move in. The Oregon and gray-headed juncos spend the entire\r\nwinter here. Great flocks of mountain bluebirds descend from the\r\nmountains and piñon jays make the hills resound with their screams.\r\nCanada geese and golden-eye ducks live on the Green River and remain\r\nuntil it freezes. The harsh croak of the raven is seldom heard in summer\r\nbut often in winter.\r\n\r\nFew birds live here in winter and summer—the golden and bald eagles, the\r\nred-tailed hawk, and the little sparrow hawk. Perhaps the most handsome\r\nyear-round resident is the magpie with its long, iridescent tail, black\r\nand white body, and white patches on its wings. One other resident makes\r\nhis presence known by his eerie cry on frosty, moonlit nights—the\r\nwestern horned owl. He hunts every night, summer and winter, but is\r\nseldom seen. Occasionally he is disturbed upon his daylight roost and as\r\nhe skillfully dodges through the junipers, he makes a joke of the story\r\nthat owls don’t see well in daylight.\r\n\r\nThe mammals that live in the vicinity of the Dinosaur Quarry are almost\r\nnever seen. There are several reasons for this—almost all of them are\r\nnocturnal, are very shy, and most of them are small.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their retiring habits, they reveal their presence in a\r\nnumber of ways. Patches of bare earth under sagebrush and nearby sandy\r\nslopes are crisscrossed with tiny paths beaten into the dust by deer\r\nmice. Along the river bank, gnawed tree stumps, a few fresh chips, and\r\nperhaps a webbed footprint tell us beaver have been active during the\r\nnight. The paired hind footprints of the kangaroo rat are common on the\r\nhillside. Freshly fallen snow records the preceding night’s activities\r\nin perfect detail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GOLDEN-MANTLED GROUND SQUIRREL]\r\n\r\nWere it not for the golden-mantled ground squirrels, our evidence of\r\nmammals would be mostly indirect. But these little fellows are very much\r\nin evidence all day long as they play around the visitor center and in\r\nthe picnic areas. They are handsome too, with their alert black eyes,\r\ncinnamon neck and shoulders, and dark side patches with white stripes.\r\nMost people call these ground squirrels chipmunks because both are\r\nstriped. Actually the two are easy to tell apart; the chipmunk’s stripes\r\nrun to the tip of its nose, but those of the golden-mantled ground\r\nsquirrel extend forward only to the shoulder region. Any small, striped\r\nmammal seen near the quarry is probably a ground squirrel, as chipmunks\r\nare rare here.\r\n\r\nThe water problem is an ever-present one for the mammals as well as the\r\nplants. At first this may seem strange with the Green River so close and\r\nseveral springs in the hills, but most of the smaller animals have very\r\nrestricted ranges. A deer mouse, for example, seldom travels more than\r\n100 feet from his home burrow in his entire lifetime. The kangaroo rat\r\nand the desert woodrat also have limited ranges although theirs are\r\nsomewhat larger than those of deer mice. The majority of such animals\r\nmust meet their water needs without springs and seeps. How do they do\r\nit?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COYOTE. (COURTESY, U. S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BADGER. (COURTESY, U. S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.)]\r\n\r\nThe food they eat contains some water. The green vegetation of\r\nspringtime contains large amounts. Even air-dried foods such as seeds\r\ncontain some. And these animals don’t need much. Through the thousands\r\nof years these little creatures have lived in arid lands, evolutionary\r\nprocesses have altered their bodies and life patterns to fit the\r\nconditions under which they must live. Surely one of the most useful and\r\ninteresting of their abilities is that of utilizing metabolic water.\r\nSuch water is obtained through oxidation of hydrogen contained in food\r\nand is a by-product of metabolism. Putting it another way, during the\r\ndigestive process these animals are able to manufacture water from the\r\nchemical constituents of their food and the oxygen in their blood. The\r\namount of water thus obtained is between 70 and 100 percent of the dry\r\nweight of the food eaten. Thus some desert animals are able to live a\r\nnormal life span without ever taking a drink, and probably many of them\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nCarnivores such as the badger and the coyote get some of their water\r\nfrom the animals they eat and may go for days without visiting a spring.\r\nBut eventually they return to the river or a spring for a drink. This is\r\nno special effort as carnivores generally range for miles in search of\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nWinter is a time of difficulty for most animals. Some of them like the\r\nground squirrels hibernate and sleep the winter away, but the majority\r\nmust rustle their “daily bread.” Winter storms drive the mule deer down\r\nfrom the high country. Mice tunnel through the snow in search of food.\r\nThe white-tailed jackrabbit and the snowshoe hare change their coats\r\nfrom brown to white. In particularly hard winters the animals die in\r\ngreat numbers, first the weak and old, then the young, and sometimes\r\neven animals in prime condition fail to survive.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles that make their homes in the Quarry Area of Dinosaur\r\nNational Monument are few in number. The rattlesnake is rare and seldom\r\nseen. The only common snake is the bull or gopher snake. This snake can\r\nappear very threatening as it swells its body and hisses loudly, but it\r\nis not poisonous. Gopher snakes climb well and are often seen in trees\r\nwhere they hunt for eggs and young birds.\r\n\r\nTwo lizards are commonly seen here during the summer. The side-blotched\r\nlizard is about 1¾ to 2⅛ inches long with a somewhat longer tail. These\r\nsmall brown lizards are frequently seen among the rocks near the parking\r\nand picnic areas. The name, side-blotched lizard, is taken from the\r\nblack or bluish-black area behind the foreleg of the males. These\r\nlizards are also called brown utas.\r\n\r\nThe western whiptail is also a very common lizard. As its name suggests,\r\nit has a very long slender tail which it lashes from side to side as it\r\nruns. This lizard is easily distinguished from the side-blotched lizard\r\nby its larger size, longer more slender tail, and the presence of bars\r\nand spots of black upon its back. In late summer, junior-sized young\r\nwhiptails appear, but their 3-inch total length is unimpressive compared\r\nto 8-inch adults. The young are quite handsome with pleasing body colors\r\nand bright-blue tails.\r\n\r\nOften lizards are seen whose tails are missing. When the tail is pulled\r\nor injured it can be shed by its owner. The shed tail may wriggle for\r\nseveral minutes and attract the predator’s attention while the lizard\r\nescapes. The tailless lizard soon grows another one that is usually\r\nrecognizable by its subdued or otherwise different color pattern.\r\nSometimes the broken tail does not fall off so it and the new tail form\r\na fork.\r\n\r\nIn summary then, we see that this apparently lifeless desert does\r\nsupport a wide variety of living things and a great number of\r\nindividuals. Some of them, the plants and small animals, live here all\r\nyear round while others, such as most birds, live here only part of the\r\ntime. But whatever the length of stay, all living things must adapt\r\nthemselves to existing conditions at the time of their stay. If they\r\ncannot adapt to static or changing conditions they must move or become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nSome 60 million years have passed since the dinosaurs ruled the world.\r\nIn that time mountains have risen, wasted away, and risen again.\r\nGlaciers have come and gone. Many species of plants and animals evolved\r\nand passed on to extinction. Every life form meets the test—adapt or\r\ndie. That test is as real to the dusty lizard basking on the quarry face\r\nas it was to the dinosaurs whose bones you came to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Key to Pronunciation\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dinosauria            (dy-noh-SAWR-eea)\r\n  Antrodemus            (an-troh-DEE-mus)\r\n  Apatosaurus           (apato-SAWR-us)\r\n  Ankylosaurus          (an-KEELOH-sawr-us)\r\n  Camptosaurus          (camp-toh-SAWR-us)\r\n  Stegosaurus           (steg-oh-SAWR-us)\r\n  Triceratops           (try-SER-a-tops)\r\n  Archosauria           (Ark-oh-SAWR-eea)\r\n  Mesozoic              (MEZ-oh-zoh-ic)\r\n  Triassic              (try-ASS-ic)\r\n  Jurassic              (jur-ASS-ic)\r\n  Cretaceous            (kre-TAY-shus)\r\n  Tyrannosaurus\t        (ty-ran-oh-SARH-us)\r\n  Saurischia            (sawr-ISS-key-a)\r\n  Ornithischia\t         (orni-THISS-key-a)\r\n  Diplodocus            (di-PLOD-icus)\r\n  Camarasaurus\t         (camara-SAWR-us)\r\n  Protiguanodon\t        (pro-teeg-GUAN-oh-don)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Suggested Readings\r\n\r\n\r\n  Andrews, Roy Chapman. _All About Dinosaurs_, 146 pp. Random House, New\r\n          York.
