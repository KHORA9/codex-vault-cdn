How many centuries ago the ocean waves sparkled and rippled over\r\nwhat is now the desert, no one can definitely say. But from the nature\r\nof the stratum is which great logs are embedded, and the fossilized\r\nreptiles found, it is known that they were entombed during the Triassic\r\nage, many millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nPetrified logs are found over a wide area, more than a hundred square\r\nmiles being covered with varying amounts of the “stone” trees. This\r\nfossilized “forest” is greater in area, more highly colored, and\r\ncontains more petrified wood than any like deposit in the world.\r\n\r\nMany visitors who have heard of the “forest” drive through miles of the\r\nReservation and ask at the Museum where they can find the Petrified\r\nForest. Inquiry discloses that they expected to find an area of standing\r\ntrees, trunks merely turned to stone, branches and all. Perhaps they\r\nhave seen one or more such trunks in Yellowstone National Park and think\r\nto find hundreds of them here. Yet, when they learn the story of these\r\nfallen monarchs, and catch a glimpse of the dazzling beauties of agate\r\nand carnelian, jasper and onyx, no signs of disappointment are seen. Let\r\nthe visitor but leave his car to view the logs, and step by step he is\r\nled on by here a gleaming fragment of carnelian, and there the soft\r\nsheen of jasper and topaz. It is like the carpet of Fairyland.\r\n\r\nThese trees did not grow where they lie, or even within many miles of\r\nwhere they are found. They were carried from a long distance to this\r\nregion by flood waters, and after whirling and drifting around in the\r\ninland sea then covering the land, they became waterlogged and finally\r\nsank to the bottom, where some eddy or whirlpool carried them. Here they\r\nlay for countless centuries, slowly being covered by silt and sand,\r\nwhile yet other logs came to rest above them. Thousands of years elapsed\r\nduring this drifting and sinking into oblivion under the ooze of this\r\nTriassic Sea. And then came Old Ocean, later on in the Mesozoic Age\r\nsubmerging the entire region and adding its weight to the terrific\r\npressure already brought to bear on the burial place of the giants. This\r\npressure packed the sands to stone, and compressed the clays to shale.\r\nAlready the logs were impregnated with a strong solution of silica, with\r\niron and manganese also present, and the pressure forced it into every\r\nfiber. Atom by atom the cells of the wood were dissolved and replaced by\r\nthe silica, which hardened, taking the exact shape of the cell it\r\ndestroyed. While the logs were probably partly petrified before the\r\ninflux of the ocean waters, a great many show that enormous pressure was\r\nbrought to bear while they were yet flexible.\r\n\r\nSome logs recently brought to light by the summer floods, are mashed\r\nalmost flat, cross sections measuring eighteen inches one way and more\r\nthan five feet the other.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy National Park Service\r\n\r\n            Cross section of log showing natural fracture.]\r\n\r\nNature did not slight details in this work of substitution. Even to the\r\nmost minute particular the structure of the wood was replaced by the\r\nintruder. Under the microscope it is possible to identify the kind of\r\nwood represented. Dr. F. H. Knowlton has classified the major portion of\r\nthese trees as belonging to a species of conebearing tree now extinct,\r\nrelated to the Norfolk Island Pine.\r\n\r\nThe logs lay buried for numberless centuries, but natural forces were at\r\nwork bringing them to the surface again. During the Tertiary Period, a\r\nslow upheaval brought the submerged area to light. On and upward it\r\nrose, until it now lies more than a mile above the level of the ocean.\r\nFreed of its Old Man of the Sea, warmed and comforted by Arizona’s\r\nbrilliant sun and searching wind, the region lay at rest.\r\n\r\nSlowly the fingers of time, tipped with wind and rain, broke through the\r\nheavier sandstone above, and tore away the softer layers of shale and\r\nmarl. Bit by bit, the covering was lifted from the buried logs, and one\r\nby one, the gem-like wonders saw the light of day. And what a glorious\r\nresurrection it was! As the support was plucked from about them, they\r\nleft their sleeping places in the sandstone and marl and rolled to the\r\nlevels below. Frost tore at their vitals; rain fell into the crevices\r\nand freezing there, expanded, until many of the finer logs are now\r\nmerely heaps of gleaming jewels, opaline and rose, lavendar and mauve,\r\ndeepest brown and softest yellow, black and purple, blue and red. In\r\ntheir range of color they leave the beauty lover breathless. And these\r\ncolors are permanent, too, having endured through the aeons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy Mrs. Adam Hanna\r\n\r\nThe most noted tree in the whole reservation. The Natural Bridge. About\r\n four feet in thickness this 111 foot log measures 44 feet between the\r\n                         sides of the arroyo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            How? When? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?”\r\n\r\nThat is usually the first question asked of the rangers in the Petrified\r\nForest.\r\n\r\nIn contact with eighty thousands or more tourists each year, there are\r\ncertain questions asked so many times that one learns what the average\r\nperson is most curious about in connection with these petrified trees.\r\nHere are the most popular of these questions, together with the answers,\r\nshorn of technical terms:\r\n\r\nWhy are none of the trees standing?\r\n\r\nThis is simply an exposed deposit of petrified logs that came here from\r\na distance, as driftwood.\r\n\r\nHow were they brought here?\r\n\r\nProbably by rivers in flood periods. This region might have been the\r\nmouth of a large river as is indicated by the crossbedded sandstone.\r\n\r\nWhy are they piled up in particular spots?\r\n\r\nThis was at one time an inland sea. The trees floated here, and were\r\nswept by whirlpools or strong currents into eddys where they became\r\nwaterlogged and sank.\r\n\r\nHow long ago was that?\r\n\r\nMen who have made a lifetime study of it, say it was from ten to forty\r\nmillion years ago.\r\n\r\nWhat became of the sea that was here?\r\n\r\nGradual upheaval of the country, aided by earthquakes and volcanic\r\naction, raised this area and drained it. The Sierras were probably\r\nbrought to their present height during these disturbances.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of trees are they?\r\n\r\nMostly an extinct species of cone bearing tree. (_Araucarioxylon\r\nArizonicum._)\r\n\r\nHow big were these trees?\r\n\r\nSome of them are now a hundred feet long, and six to eight feet in\r\ndiameter. The Natural Bridge is one hundred and eleven feet long. The\r\nheight of some of these trees while standing was doubtless two hundred\r\nfeet or more.\r\n\r\nWhy did they turn to rock?\r\n\r\nThey did not really turn to stone. Silica and minerals in solution were\r\nforced into the wood, dissolved it, and replaced the wood cells with\r\ntheir own substance.\r\n\r\nHow is it polished?\r\n\r\nBy a process of grinding with carborundum and diamond dust, then rubbed\r\nwith leather buffer. It approaches the diamond in hardness and an\r\nordinary emery wheel will scarcely mark it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the weight of the petrified wood?\r\n\r\nAbout 200 pounds to the cubic foot. It varies.\r\n\r\nWhy can’t visitors take specimens away with them?\r\n\r\nFirst: Because it is against the United States Law. After that comes\r\nconsideration of future visitors to the Petrified Forest National\r\nMonument. When one reflects that there are about eighty thousand\r\nvisitors here annually and that if each visitor took what pleased him,\r\nit is an unrefutable fact the best specimens would speedily disappear. A\r\nvisitor would not be satisfied with one small piece. There would be the\r\nhome folks to consider; the neighbor that fed the left-at-home cat, and\r\nthe friend who loaned his kodak for the trip. These would all need\r\nsouvenirs. It would be difficult to choose among several beautiful\r\npieces and so a compromise would be made by taking all of them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy National Park Service\r\n\r\n  They leave their sleeping places in the sides of the marl hills and\r\n                         roll to levels below.]\r\n\r\nWhat is a National Monument?\r\n\r\nAn area set aside by the President of the United States to preserve\r\nregions of scientific, historic or prehistoric interest.\r\n\r\nWhat is the area of the Petrified Forest National Monument?\r\n\r\n25,908 acres.\r\n\r\nWho has charge of it?\r\n\r\nThe National Park Service, one of the largest and the most important\r\nbureaus of the Department of the Interior. A custodian and several Park\r\nRangers are the immediate representatives of the Government on the\r\nReservation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy National Park Service\r\n\r\nAs the soil slowly settles beneath these giants their weight dismembers\r\n  them. In this way they were broken in the lengths we find them now.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Rainbow and Third Forests\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rainbow Forest lies eighteen miles east of Holbrook on U. S. Highway\r\n70, the Holbrook-Springerville Road, open and in splendid condition the\r\nyear around. This Rainbow Forest area contains a greater amount of\r\nhighly colored petrified wood, than any of the other “forests” included\r\nin the Reservation.\r\n\r\nThe varied and decided coloring of the logs, many of which are broken\r\ninto minute chips, is so gorgeous that it has been given this name. The\r\noutstanding features of the Rainbow Forest are the logs themselves,\r\nwhich may be seen in all stages of preservation, some not entirely\r\nuncovered, some lying on the sides of the marl hills waiting their time\r\nto be let down by erosion, to the levels below, some almost at the top\r\nof the sandstone cap, and others in fragments at the bottoms of ravines;\r\nthe Government Museum, which is free to the public, located half a mile\r\nfrom the highway. In this building the Government has collected\r\noutstanding specimens of wood from all sections of the Reservation.\r\nThese representative specimens, both polished and unpolished form an\r\ninteresting exhibit. Here too, are Indian relics found in the\r\nprehistoric ruins scattered throughout the area. Many of the sections of\r\nwood here surpass the very finest Italian marble both in coloring and\r\ncomposition. One huge section of a log, weighing a ton, holds all the\r\ncolors of the rainbow and the intermediate tints. One may trace woodland\r\nscenes, Japanese landscapes, city skylines, outlines of animals and\r\ntrees in the polished surface of this tree. This specimen was shipped to\r\nDenver and polished there, and required many days of grinding with\r\ncarborundum and diamond dust. No visitor fails to admire it. Another\r\nexhibit which evokes admiration is a globe about eight inches in\r\ndiameter, which was turned and polished in Germany. It was originally a\r\nbig knot or burl and shows swirls of color like a child’s agate marble.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy National Park Service\r\n\r\n Showing work of erosion. This log is becoming slowly undermined by the\r\n                      action of the small stream.]\r\n\r\nIn this Museum are fragments of wood bearing at their clusters of topaz\r\ncrystals, black crystals and beautiful purple amethysts. Various\r\nexplanations have been advanced as to why these gemlike formations are\r\nfound in the wood. One authority says cavities in the logs caused by\r\ndecay, are filled by mineral crystals, there being no wood fiber to\r\nabsorb. Other geologists offer the theory that the resin and sap forced\r\nto the center formed into tangible shape by being crystalized. Be that\r\nas it may, the semi-precious stones were very much sought after, and a\r\ngreat jewelry concern in the East had a crew of men working in these\r\n“forests” blasting the precious work of nature to pieces in search of\r\nthe jewels.\r\n\r\nOf course this vandalism ceased abruptly when in 1906 President\r\nRoosevelt issued the proclamation which made this Reservation a National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum is a register, in which all visitors are expected to sign\r\ntheir names. In this book are found names from practically every\r\ncivilized nation in the world.\r\n\r\nIn this Rainbow Forest is found one of the best preserved trees with the\r\nstump, that has been discovered. It is to the Petrified Forest what the\r\nOld Faithful Geyser is to Yellowstone Park. It is the tourists’ friend.\r\nThis log is the favorite picture place in the entire Reservation. Here\r\nparties stop their car and visit the fallen monarch. Almost any hour of\r\nthe day in pleasant weather, one can see little children playing on this\r\nbig log. Here they lunch and rest, and here they pose for their\r\nphotographs. The old fellow must have many happy memories collected\r\nthrough the ages. It lies in the sunlight at the brow of the hill, as\r\none drops down to the Museum. Most probably before this log was broken\r\ninto sections, it measured well over two hundred feet. It is now about\r\nfifty feet long, and at its thickest portion, measures six feet through.\r\nThe great stump still remains as it was when some terrific storm,\r\nmillions of years ago, uprooted it in its native forest. We call it “Old\r\nFaithful.”\r\n\r\nA mile or two east of the Museum is the Third Forest. Here is a tangible\r\nsign that our far-removed forefathers admired the utility of the\r\npetrified wood, if they did not appreciate its beauty.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of quite a castle stand on the crest of a hill overlooking the\r\nplains, and one can almost visualize the first dwellers in this mystic\r\nland. See them laboriously carrying the heavy blocks of petrified wood\r\nto the top of the hill where they are laid out in orderly rows to form\r\nrooms. In the meantime, a close watch is kept that neither animal nor\r\nhuman enemy may creep up unheeded. The walls have fallen during the\r\npassage of time, but each foundation can be traced. Shards of broken\r\npottery in great amounts lie at the base of the hill. We wonder if some\r\nangry housewife fired it out at her better half as he stumbled home from\r\na prehistoric lodge room too late to please her?\r\n\r\nHere, too, are found the workshops of arrowmakers. Chips, flaked thin as\r\nwafers, lie like bits of rainbows about the place, and show that they\r\nwere broken from larger pieces by human agencies. This, we think, was\r\ndone by heating the rock wood to a high temperature and then touching,\r\nlightly, the spot to be chipped with a feather dipped in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Second Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the Headquarters area, where the Museum is located, the visitor\r\ndrives over a winding road, beautiful in its arid desert beauty, six or\r\nseven miles to reach the Second Forest. Were it my privilege to name\r\nthis lovely section I should call it “The Coral Garden”. In this\r\n“forest” are many logs encrusted with coral formation. Some of them have\r\nbroken apart and even the interiors are mossed with the coral, soft rose\r\nin color. The ground is covered with tiny round stones, coral colored.\r\nHere many logs are filled with crystals and the range of coloring found\r\nin the chips strewn over the landscape is marvelous. Many pebbles bear\r\nthe impression of seashells, and deep in the heart of a section of\r\npetrified log was found a fossilized mussel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy National Park Service\r\n\r\n At one place in the First Forest a slender column of rock rises to the\r\n        height of thirty or forty feet. This is the Eagle Rock.]\r\n\r\nThere is little of the sandstone cap in this area, and the logs lie in\r\nthe blue-gray marl formation. Here we find larger trees in greater\r\nmasses than elsewhere. Many of the trees lie piled on top of others in\r\nthe coulees and small arroyos, carved out by wind and rain, during the\r\ncenturies since these logs first settled there. One big tree, near the\r\nroad, is mashed flat its entire length of perhaps ninety feet. Evidences\r\nof bark are plain on this particular log, and where the limbs were torn\r\noff, the grain of the wood is quite discernible. One could spend hours\r\nin this area, spellbound with the beautiful sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Natural Bridge\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout eight miles from Headquarters, and three miles from the Second\r\nForest, is the most noted tree in the Monument, the Natural Bridge. This\r\nsleeping giant lies where it was abandoned as a plaything by the waters\r\nthat carried it here. Each end is firmly embedded in the sandstone rock,\r\nwhich was formerly the sand at the bottom of the sea. In the process of\r\nerosion, which finally carried away all of the material above this log,\r\nit ultimately came to lie on the surface of the ground. As the land\r\nrises somewhat to the south of it, water gathered there with the big log\r\nforming a natural dam. This water tended to soften the sandstone, and\r\nafter a period of time it forced its way through under the log. Soon\r\nthis became a free passage for the water, and resulted in the formation\r\nof the gorge which the prostrate trunk spans today.\r\n\r\nThe Natural Bridge log is about four feet in thickness at the largest\r\npoint in sight. Part of the log is still encrusted with the sandstone\r\nwhich wrapped it about, before wind and rain unshrouded it. The canyon\r\nis twenty-five feet deep, and this one hundred and eleven foot log\r\nmeasures forty-four feet between the points at which it rests on the\r\nsides of the arroyo.\r\n\r\nFrom the canyon beneath it, cedar, juniper and cottonwood trees have\r\nsprung to life and grown up to furnish shade for this comrade of another\r\nAge. They must seem mere upstarts to this old veteran!\r\n\r\nA hundred yards or so to the east, down over the rim of the mesa, is\r\nanother freak of erosion, called the Pedestal Log. It is a large\r\nsection, resting upon a support of sandstone, ten or fifteen feet above\r\nthe level of the surrounding plain. It forms a protective cap which has\r\nkept the softer material immediately under it from washing away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The First Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, again, were I choosing a suitable name for this portion of the\r\nReservation I should not hesitate to call it “The Vandal’s Paradise”. It\r\nhas been badly denuded of its finest specimens, and the big trees\r\ndemolished by vandals. Here the despoiler has had full sway. Great trees\r\nare blown to atoms by searchers for the semi-precious jewels. Choice\r\nspecimens have been hauled away by the carload. There was no law, other\r\nthan one’s own individual decency to protect these jeweled timbers lying\r\nnear Adamana, which for years was the nearest railroad station and the\r\nonly entrance to the Reservation. This “forest” is located five miles\r\nsouth of Adamana, and is about half a mile from the Natural Bridge. It\r\nis composed of trees, which are geologically speaking, “all out of\r\nplace”. That means they have all, by the work of erosion, been let down\r\nfrom higher levels. They are badly shattered, but, nevertheless\r\nbeautiful, on account of the vivid coloring found in the fragments.\r\nAnother feature of this area is the carving of the rocks into beautiful\r\nand fantastic shapes by the elements. At one place a slender column of\r\nsandstone rises to the height of twenty-five or thirty feet, and\r\nbroadens at the top into a platform perhaps ten feet across. Here, for\r\nyears, an eagle has nested, and the rock bears the official name of\r\n“Eagle Rock.” Quite close to this rock is the “Snow Lady”, a statuesque\r\npillar against the background of an imposing cliff.\r\n\r\nAfter an extended visit in 1889, Prof. Lester F. Ward, an eminent\r\npaleobotanist, on the staff of the United States Geological Survey,\r\nrecommended that this area be made a National Park, or Reservation, in\r\norder to preserve it from destruction and oblivion. Local leaders\r\nbrought pressure to bear upon their representatives in Washington, and\r\nat least one of Holbrook’s leading men, Mr. W. H. Clark, made a trip to\r\nWashington in the interest of preserving the Petrified Forest. He saw\r\nPresident Roosevelt in person and for half an hour talked with him\r\nconcerning the reasons no action had been taken by Congress to protect\r\nthe Forest. He left with the President’s assurance that something would\r\nbe done. This something was a proclamation by President Roosevelt on\r\nDecember 8, 1906, declaring the area to be a National Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Prehistoric Dwellers\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout Arizona can be found traces of a vanished people. In and\r\naround the Petrified Forest, prehistoric dwellings and “picture\r\nwritings” are plentiful, and of great antiquity and high development.\r\nProbably nowhere have such pictographs been so well preserved. The soft\r\nsmooth sandstone was an ideal surface for the artist to work upon, and\r\nnowhere in the world, in that age, could such suitable tools be found to\r\nwork with. Here at hand were sharp pointed chisels already prepared by\r\nthe fracturing of wood. These chisels were hard enough to cut glass.\r\nRounded pieces of the same material made excellent mallets. Hundreds of\r\nthese have been found in the Reservation. With these rude instruments,\r\nthis unknown people left for us a record of their existence graven deep\r\nin the sandstone in sheltered places. These pictures today are a lasting\r\nmonument to the race that roamed this region in the gone-by centuries.\r\n\r\nThese sketches depict different kinds of animals, such as antelope and\r\nmountain sheep, snakes and turtles. They are grotesque and out of\r\nproportion, but doubtless they represent, for the most part, animals\r\nthat formerly roamed the western plains. Some pictures, however,\r\nrepresent animals that could never have been seen on land and sea, and\r\nexisted only in the fevered imagination of the artist. Perhaps there\r\nwere futurist artists even among those primitive men.\r\n\r\nIn one scene a herd of deer cross a plain. Near that a stork stands on\r\nattenuated legs and dangles what appears to be a baby in its bill. This\r\nis doubtless the earliest picturization of a stork’s visit. In another\r\nplace a long line of human figures clasp their hands and drag one\r\nanother up a steep incline. In the heart of the Reservation lies a mesa\r\nalmost entirely surrounded by a steep cliff that has broken and fallen\r\nin ruins. On the huge boulders that have rolled to the desert below,\r\nthere are pages and pages of history could one but read what is so\r\nplainly written. One figure stands alone disconsolately weeping. Quite\r\nmonstrous tears are falling from his eyes, and just beneath his weeping\r\nfigure a six inch bowl was found. Although broken in half by the passage\r\nof time with its destructive elements the piece of pottery, at least two\r\nthousand years old, was carefully restored and has an honored place in\r\nthe Government Museum.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Courtesy C. J. Smith\r\n\r\n Graven deep into the stone in sheltered places thousands of years ago,\r\n  these pictures are a lasting monument to the people who roamed this\r\n                   region in the gone-by centuries.]\r\n\r\nOn almost every mesa are the remains of ancient dwellings. There are\r\narrowmaker’s chips and fragments of pottery, and crude colored beads\r\nthat may have delighted some wee maiden with their brilliance. The\r\npottery shows two distinct varieties, the finger-nail decorations\r\ncovering the blackened bowls which seem to have served as cooking\r\nutensils, and the finer pottery, on which the black and white tracings\r\nare as startlingly vivid today, as they were so many, many centuries ago\r\nwhen they were drawn by the day-dreaming housewife as she sat in the sun\r\nand painted the fanciful designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Historical\r\n\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the Gadsden Purchase, at the close of the Mexican War, what\r\nis now Arizona came into possession of the United States. At this date,\r\n1848, there was no record of the Petrified Forest ever having been seen\r\nby white men. In 1853 Lieut. Whipple, engaged in surveying a railroad\r\nroute to the Pacific, discovered the deposits lying to the north of the\r\npresent Reservation. He did not, however, discover the deposits of\r\npetrified wood south of Adamana, and there is no definite record of just\r\nwhen, and by whom, these “forests” were first seen. John Muir claims to\r\nhave discovered the Blue Forest.\r\n\r\nAn Indian legend tells that one of their Goddesses wandered into the\r\nplace which is now the Petrified Forest. She was hungry, cold and\r\nexhausted. When she saw the hundreds of logs lying around she was\r\ndelighted and managed to kill a rabbit with a club, expecting to have a\r\ndelicious supper. When she attempted to kindle a fire to cook her kill,\r\nthe logs were wet and would not burn. In anger and her disappointment,\r\nshe cursed the spot and turned the logs into stone that they might never\r\nburn.\r\n\r\nAs travel became more plentiful over the Santa Fe Railroad and across\r\ncountry, great amounts of the fossilized wood were carried away or\r\ndestroyed, and the people of the Territory became alarmed about their\r\nunprotected treasure. In 1895 the assembly sent this Memorial to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           House Memorial No. 4\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF\r\nAMERICA IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:\r\n\r\nWe, your memorialists, the eighteenth legislative assembly of Arizona,\r\nbeg leave to represent to your honorable bodies:\r\n\r\nFIRST: That there is in the northern part of this Territory, lying\r\nwithin the borders of Apache County, near the Town of Holbrook, a\r\nwonderful deposit of petrified wood commonly called the “Petrified\r\nForest” or “Chalcedony Park”. This deposit, or forest, is unequalled for\r\nits extent, the size of the trees and the beauty and great variety of\r\ncoloring found in the logs.\r\n\r\nThe country ten miles square is covered by the trunks of trees, some of\r\nwhich measure over two hundred feet in length and from seven to ten feet\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nRuthless curiosity seekers are destroying these huge trees and logs by\r\nblasting them in pieces in search of crystals, which are found in the\r\ncenter of many of them, while carloads of the limbs and smaller pieces\r\nare being shipped away to be ground up for various purposes.\r\n\r\nSECOND: Believing that this wonderful deposit should be kept inviolate,\r\nthat future generations may enjoy its beauties and study one of the most\r\ncurious and interesting effects of nature’s forces,\r\n\r\nWe, your memorialists, most respectfully request that the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office be directed to withdraw from entry all public\r\nlands covered by this forest until a Commission, or officer appointed by\r\nyour honorable body, may investigate and report to you upon the\r\nadvisability of taking this forest under the charge of the General\r\nGovernment and making a National Park or Reservation of it. * * *\r\n\r\n                                                J. H. Carpenter, SPEAKER\r\n                                                  A. J. Doran, PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nFiled in the office of the Secretary of the Territory of Arizona this\r\n11th day of February A. D. 1895, at 11 a. m.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was effective and Congress appointed Prof. Lester F. Ward to\r\nvisit the Petrified Forest and make a report. The report was favorable\r\nto preservation, and acting with his usual promptness, President\r\nTheodore Roosevelt issued the proclamation which created the Petrified\r\nForest National Monument.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Photo by C. J. Smith\r\n\r\n  The surrounding country has washed away in the passing of years and\r\nleaves this mammoth cross section thirty feet or more above the plain.]\r\n\r\nThis proclamation, in part, follows:\r\n\r\n  BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, it is provided by section two of the Act of Congress,\r\n  approved June 8, 1906, entitled, “AN ACT FOR THE PRESERVATION OF\r\n  AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES”, “THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS\r\n  HEREBY AUTHORIZED, IN HIS DISCRETION, TO DECLARE BY PUBLIC\r\n  PROCLAMATION HISTORIC LANDMARKS, HISTORIC AND PREHISTORIC STRUCTURES,\r\n  AND OTHER OBJECTS OF HISTORIC OR SCIENTIFIC INTEREST TO BE NATIONAL\r\n  MONUMENTS * * *\r\n\r\n  And, whereas the mineralized remains of Mesozoic forests, commonly\r\n  known as the “Petrified Forest”, in the Territory of Arizona, situated\r\n  upon the public lands owned and controlled by the United States, are\r\n  of the greatest scientific interest and value, and it appears that the\r\n  public good would be promoted by reserving these deposits of\r\n  fossilized wood as a national monument with as much land as may seem\r\n  necessary for the proper protection thereof;\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States\r\n  of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by section two of the\r\n  aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby set aside as the Petrified Forest\r\n  National Monument * * *\r\n\r\n  Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to\r\n  appropriate, excavate, injure, or destroy any of the mineralized\r\n  forest remains hereby declared to be a National Monument or to locate\r\n  or settle upon any of the lands reserved and made a part of said\r\n  Monument by this proclamation.\r\n\r\n  In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of\r\n  the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n  Done at the city of Washington, this 8th day of December, in the year\r\n  of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and six and the Independence of\r\n  the United States the one hundred and thirty-first.\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, President Taft made a new proclamation reducing the extent of\r\nthe Petrified Forest National Monument to its present size of 25,908\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Blue Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Blue Forest was included in the National Monument originally\r\nit is now several miles outside the present boundary. It is from this\r\nsection that much of the wood used commercially is obtained. Many find\r\nthis weird formation the most interesting spot in the entire country.\r\nMiles and more miles of blue-gray mounds, varying in size, formed of the\r\ncrumbling marl have been beaten and blown into a semblance of numberless\r\nhaystacks. It is arduous climbing to reach the top of this Blue Forest,\r\nbut the view obtained is well worth the skinned knees and twisted ankles\r\nproduced by rolling shale. From the highest elevation there is a view\r\nthat beggars description. One cannot put into words his feeling of\r\ndesolation, of helplessness, that comes in looking over the formation.\r\nVanishing in the distance the mounds lie in rows that grow gradually\r\nsmaller and smaller until they melt into the level landscape below. On\r\nthe tops of these cold, blue mounds great trees lie prone, many of them\r\nshattered and cascading their jeweled hearts down the slope....\r\n\r\nHere great piles of splintered, colorless wood are found, looking as if\r\nthe chopper had just left the scene of his labors, the chips of his\r\nday’s work lying scattered about. Again, a big tree broken open by the\r\nfrost, or other agencies, discloses a lining of gleaming crystals,\r\nglittering and sparkling in the Arizona sun. Here the great dinosaur\r\nlived and died, and from his tomb fossil bones have been carried to\r\nuniversities far and wide. Here the phytosaurus and the stegosaurus\r\nbreathed their last, and from here was taken the wicked looking upper\r\njaw of a phytosaurus which had weathered the ravages of time and\r\nelements. This lies in a glass case in the store at Headquarters, where\r\nall may see it and be thankful such creatures roam this region no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nHere, the rattlesnake lies coiled in the shade of the sombre hued cones,\r\nand scarcely troubles to sound his warning when visitors intrude.\r\nOverhead a tireless buzzard hangs suspended. No other signs of life are\r\nseen in this dead gray waste, the burial plot of the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Painted Desert\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the Petrified Forest visitors are intensely interested in the\r\nPainted Desert, lying only a few miles from Adamana. On U. S. Highway\r\n66, six miles from the Rio Puerco, one comes to a sign: “Painted Desert\r\nInn”. A mile from the highway this inn is stationed. But before reaching\r\nthe building, an abrupt climb brings one to the top of the mesa, and\r\nspread out before the eyes is the world’s most magnificent palette, with\r\nthe colors ready mixed,—The Painted Desert. It is a breath-taking vision\r\nthat bursts on one’s sight, this “El Pintado Desierto” that Coronado\r\nstumbled upon and named in 1540. As far as one can see colors mingle and\r\nglow. From the most delicate lavendar to the deepest purple, from palest\r\npink to flaming red, greens, browns, chocolate and blues, all the colors\r\nare here. This desert does not lie in level sandy stretches, but is\r\nformed of mounds and hills, and varying sizes of “haystacks”.\r\n\r\nWith each hour, as the light changes in the sky, so change the colors of\r\nthis wonderland. It is truly the foot of the rainbow. Walk down the\r\ntrail and there is the bewildered feeling that one has strayed into an\r\nimmense paint factory which has just been badly wrecked! The sand\r\nunderfoot is light, almost like burnt earth, but the colors are there,\r\nmixed by the Super Artist.\r\n\r\nThis Painted Desert is a fitting frame for the Petrified Forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   How To Reach The Petrified Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Petrified Forest is one of the most popular and accessible units of\r\nthe National Park Service, open every day in the year. Westbound\r\ntourists traveling by automobile may choose between two great\r\ncontinental highways that will lead directly to the “Forest”.\r\n\r\nU. S. Highway No. 66 passes on the north and tourists may enter the\r\nForest either from Adamana or Holbrook. This highway brings the traveler\r\nby the famous Painted Desert.\r\n\r\nU. S. Highway No. 70 on the Carlsbad-Petrified Forest-Grand Canyon\r\nRoute, winds through the foothills of the White Mountains by way of\r\nSpringerville, and passes through one of the most interesting sections\r\nof the Petrified Forest.\r\n\r\nEastbound tourists enter the Forest from Holbrook where Highways No. 66\r\nand 70 meet.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Fe railroad, carrying The Chief, The Navajo, The California\r\nLimited and the Grand Canyon Limited runs through Holbrook and Winslow.\r\nEither east or west bound travelers on any of these trains may obtain a\r\ntwenty-four hour stopover. “La Posada” at Winslow combines all the\r\nromance and fascination of the old Spanish regime with the most modern\r\nconveniences for the comfort of those wishing to make it their home\r\nwhile visiting surrounding attractions. From this hotel, the well known\r\nHarveycar Motor Coaches, each with its charming girl courier, conveys\r\nguests to the Petrified Forest.\r\n\r\nFor those wishing to visit the Forest and resume their journey the same\r\nday, arrangements have been made to meet eastbound Navajo No. 2, at\r\nWinslow, take the guest to “La Posada” for breakfast, drive from there\r\nto the Petrified Forest, where the most interesting points, including\r\nthe Museum, are visited, and then rejoin the train at Holbrook. The\r\nprogram is reversed with west bound tourists on Navajo No. 9. The\r\ncoaches meeting the train at Holbrook make the “Petrified Forest Detour”\r\nand drive to Winslow for luncheon at the hotel, resuming train travel\r\nthere. This trip affords a convenient and inexpensive means of seeing\r\nthe “Forest” and is a pleasant interruption of a long train journey. Any\r\ntourist agency or Santa Fe ticket office can furnish additional\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nRainbow Lodge, near the Museum at Headquarters of Petrified Forest, is\r\nprepared to accommodate overnight visitors. New rock cabins and food\r\nsupplies are available.\r\n\r\nA public camp ground is provided by the Government.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: View of the Painted Desert, near Holbrook.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PRICE 25 CENTS\r\n                  _Postpaid Anywhere in United States_\r\n\r\n                          DAMA MARGARET SMITH\r\n                           Holbrook, Arizona\r\n\r\n                                PRESS OF\r\n                           WINSLOW DAILY MAIL\r\n                            WINSLOW, ARIZONA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few palpable typos.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
