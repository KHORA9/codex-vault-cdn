The former of these two\r\nperiods embraces the greater part of the stroke, and it is only a\r\nsmall proportion at the end which requires the exercise of the full\r\npower of the press to bring the material to the determined degree of\r\nconsolidation. Consequently, if a hydraulic press is to be worked so\r\nas to waste no time, it requires to be provided with means by which\r\nits table may be made to rise rapidly during the portion of the stroke\r\nwhen the resistance is small, and afterward more slowly when the\r\nentire power of the pumps is being expended upon the final squeeze.\r\nMany methods of obtaining this end have been devised, and are in\r\ncommon use both here and abroad. It is, however, more particularly in\r\nthe packing of raw material that such appliances are useful, since the\r\ngoods pressed into bales in this country are not usually of a very\r\nyielding nature, and consequently do not require a long stroke to\r\nbring them to a high state of compression. In India and Egypt, from\r\nwhence cotton is sent in bales, presses must have a long stroke; and\r\nunless they can be worked rapidly, a very considerable amount of plant\r\nis required to get through a moderate quantity of work. To meet the\r\nnecessities of these countries, Mr. Watson has devised several forms\r\nof press in which not only is the table made to rise rapidly through\r\nthe greater part of its stroke, but the rams are kept almost\r\nconstantly in motion, so that the time occupied in filling the box\r\nwith raw cotton and in placing the ties round the bales is not lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 1 and 2.]\r\n\r\nWe illustrate four forms of Mr. Watson's presses, Fig. 1 being an\r\nearlier construction, which, although very rapid at the date at which\r\nit was brought out, has been far surpassed in celerity by the\r\narrangements shown in Figs. 3 to 8. It was introduced in 1873, and\r\nforty-three presses according to this design were sent to India by the\r\nmakers, Messrs. Fawcett, Preston & Co., of Phoenix Foundry,\r\nLiverpool, between that year and 1880. Four presses of this kind are\r\nworked by one engine, having a cylinder 20 in. by 3 ft. stroke, and\r\ndriving eighteen to twenty pumps of varying diameter and short stroke.\r\nThe press has two long-stroke rams, LL, of small diameter, to compress\r\nthe loose material, and two short-stroke rams, FF, of large diameter,\r\nto give the final squeeze. These two pairs of rams act alternately,\r\nthe one pair being idle while the other is in operation. The lashing\r\nof the bale takes place while the larger rams are in action, the bale\r\nbeing supported on the grid, B, which is pushed under it through\r\ngrooves formed in the press-head, S (Fig. 1). When the grid is in\r\nplace the press-head can be lowered, and the box be filled, while the\r\nbale is receiving its final squeeze from the inverted rams above.\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 the press is shown in the position it would occupy if\r\nthe bale, M, were just completed and ready to be pushed out, and the\r\nbox, N, were full of material. The filling doors, CC, are shown turned\r\nback level with the floor, the main doors, AA, are open, as are also\r\nthe end doors, KK, to admit the men to fasten up the bale. If water be\r\nadmitted to the subsidiary cylinder, H, the head, G, and two rams, FF,\r\nwill be raised, and then the bale, M, can be thrown out finished. All\r\nthe doors are now closed and water admitted to the rams, LL. These\r\nimmediately rise, pushing the contents of the box, N, before them, and\r\ncompressing them until the table, S, reaches the level of the grid, B.\r\nAt this moment the tappet rod, D, shuts off the water, and withdraws\r\nthe bolt of the doors, AA, which fly open. The grid, B (Fig. 2), is\r\nthen run through the grooves in the press-head, S, and the rams, LL,\r\nare allowed to descend ready for a baling cloth to be inserted through\r\nthe doors, EE, and for the box, N, to be refilled. At the same time\r\nthe head, G, comes down on to the bale and compresses it still\r\nfurther, while the men are at work lashing it. When the material is in\r\nhanks, like jute, the rams, LL, are lowered slowly, while a man\r\nstanding inside the box, at about the level of the floor, packs the\r\nmaterial neatly on the table.\r\n\r\nThese presses can be worked with great rapidity, the average output\r\nduring a day varying from 21 to 28 bales an hour. The consumption of\r\ncoal per bale is 9 lb. of Bengal coal, in value about ¾d. The density\r\nof the cotton bales produced is about 45 lb. per cubic foot, 400 lb.\r\nmeasuring a little under 9 cubic feet for shipment. In the case of\r\njute or jute roots, the same weight occupies 10 cubic feet on an\r\naverage. But rapid as this press is in action, the necessities of\r\nrecent business in India have called for still more expeditious\r\nworking, and to meet this demand Mr. Watson produced his compound\r\npress, in which the economy of time is carried to its utmost\r\ndevelopment. By the addition of a second pair of long-stroke rams the\r\noutput of the press has been trebled, being raised to 80 bales per\r\nhour. To effect this, there is one pair of powerful rams, as in the\r\npress just described, but two pairs of the long-stroke rams. Further,\r\neach pair of the small-diameter rams is fitted with two boxes, one of\r\nwhich is always being filled while the other is being pressed. The\r\nrams in rising compress the material into a small cell or box,\r\nsituated above the box in which raw cotton is thrown. On the top of\r\nthe ram head there is a loose lashing plate, which, at the finish of\r\nthe action of the rams, is locked in the cell by bolts actuated by a\r\nsuitable locking gear. While in this cell the bale has the lashing\r\nropes put round it, and then it is placed under the large rams for the\r\nfinal squeeze, during which the ties or ropes are permanently secured.\r\nThus neither of the small presses has even to wait while its box is\r\nbeing filled, or while the previously pressed bale is being lashed.\r\nEven in the large press, when the ties are finally fastened, the time\r\noccupied does not exceed three-quarters of a minute, and is often much\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 3 and 4.]\r\n\r\nThis press is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The small rams are arranged at\r\neither side of the large ones, which, in this case, are not inverted.\r\nTo each of the smaller presses there is a pair of boxes mounted on a\r\nvertical column, around which they can revolve to bring either box\r\nover the rain head. When the left hand rams rise, the material is\r\ndelivered into the cell, D, which previously has had its doors (Fig.\r\n4) closed. To permit of the cell, D, being moved out of the way, it is\r\nmounted so that it can revolve on one of the columns of the main\r\npress, first into the position shown at B (Fig. 4), and afterward to C\r\n(Fig. 3). While at D, the bale in the cell (called from its\r\nconstruction a revolver) is partly lashed, the ties or ropes being put\r\ninto position. It is then rotated until it comes over the large rams,\r\nwhere the bale is still more compressed and secured.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this press provides for the greatest possible\r\neconomy of time, and for the largest output, for the capital employed,\r\nwhich can be attained. The rams and the men are constantly in action,\r\nand not a single moment is lost. For filling each box 78 seconds are\r\nallowed, and there is ample time for the preliminary lashing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 5 and 6.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 5 and 6 show a modification of this press, designed to turn out\r\nsixty bales per hour. It has only one set of long-stroke rams, with\r\nthree revolvers. The bale receives its preliminary lashing while in\r\nthe position, B (Fig. 6). Fifty-three seconds are available for\r\nfilling the box, and the same time for the preliminary lashing. It is\r\nfound, however, that three-quarters of a minute is sufficient for the\r\ncomplete hooping of a bale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 7 and 8.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 7 and 8 show a similar press intended for jute pressing. This\r\nhas only one box, which is fixed, as the material has to be packed in\r\nan orderly manner. Its speed is sixty bales an hour.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJET PROPELLERS.--HYDRAULIC PROPULSION OF VESSELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain mechanical devices appear to exercise a remarkable influence\r\non some minds, and engineers are blamed for not adopting them, in no\r\nvery measured terms in some cases. It is not in any way necessary that\r\nthese devices should have been invented by the men who advocate their\r\nadoption, in order to secure that advocacy. The intrinsic attractions\r\nof the scheme suffice to evoke eulogy; and engineers sometimes find it\r\nvery difficult to make those who believe in such devices understand\r\nthat there are valid reasons standing in the way of their adoption.\r\nOne such device is hydraulic propulsion. A correspondent in a recent\r\nimpression suggested its immediate and extended use in yachts at all\r\nevents, and we willingly published his letter, because the system does\r\nno doubt lend itself very freely to adoption for a particular class of\r\nyachts, namely, those provided with auxiliary power only. But because\r\nthis is the case it must not be assumed that the jet propeller is\r\nbetter than screw or paddle-wheel propulsion; and it is just as well,\r\nbefore, correspondence extends further, that we should explain why and\r\nin what way it is not satisfactory. The arguments to be urged in favor\r\nof hydraulic propulsion are many and cogent; but it will not fail to\r\nstrike our readers, we think, that all these arguments refer, not to\r\nthe efficiency of the system, but to its convenience. A ship with a\r\nhydraulic propeller can sail without let or hindrance; a powerful pump\r\nis provided, which will deal with an enormous leak, and so on. If all\r\nthe good things which hydraulic propulsion promises could be had\r\ncombined with a fair efficiency, then the days of the screw propeller\r\nand the paddle wheel would be numbered; but the efficiency of the\r\nhydraulic propeller is very low, and we hope to make the reason why it\r\nis low intelligible to readers who are ignorant of mathematics. Those\r\nwho are not ignorant of them will find no difficulty in applying them\r\nto what we have to say, and arriving at similar conclusions in a\r\ndifferent way.\r\n\r\nProfessor Greenhill has advanced in our pages a new theory of the\r\nscrew propeller. As the series of papers in which he puts forward his\r\ntheory is not complete, we shall not in any way criticise it; but we\r\nmust point out that the view he takes is not that taken by other\r\nwriters and reasoners on the subject, and in any case it will not\r\napply to hydraulic propulsion. For these reasons we shall adhere in\r\nwhat we are about to advance to the propositions laid down by\r\nProfessor Rankine, as the exponent of the hitherto received theory of\r\nthe whole subject. When a screw or paddle wheel is put in motion, a\r\nbody of water is driven astern and the ship is driven ahead. Water,\r\nfrom its excessive mobility, is incapable of giving any resistance to\r\nthe screw or paddle save that due to its inertia. If, for example, we\r\nconceive of the existence of a sea without any inertia, then we can\r\nreadily understand that the water composing such a sea would offer no\r\nresistance to being pushed astern by paddle or screw. When a gun is\r\nfired, the weapon moves in one direction--this is called its\r\nrecoil--while the shot moves in another direction. The same\r\nprincipal--_pace_ Professor Greenhill--operates to cause the movement\r\nof a ship. The water is driven in one direction, the ship in another.\r\nNow, Professor Rankine has laid down the proposition that, other\r\nthings being equal, that propeller must be most efficient which sends\r\nthe largest quantity of water astern at the slowest speed. This is a\r\nvery important proposition, and it should be fully grasped and\r\nunderstood in all its bearings. The reason why of it is very simple.\r\nReturning for a moment to our gun, we see that a certain amount of\r\nwork is done on it in causing it to recoil; but the whole of the work\r\ndone by the powder is, other things being equal, a constant quantity.\r\nThe sum of the work done on the shot and on the gun in causing their\r\nmotions is equal to the energy expended by the powder, consequently\r\nthe more work we do on the gun, the less is available for the shot. It\r\ncan be shown that, if the gun weighed no more than the shot, when the\r\ncharge was ignited the gun and the shot would proceed in opposite\r\ndirections at similar velocities--very much less than that which the\r\nshot would have had had the gun been held fast, and very much greater\r\nthan the gun would have had if its weight were, as is usually the\r\ncase, much in excess of that of the shot. In like manner, part of the\r\nwork of a steam engine is done in driving the ship ahead, and part in\r\npushing the water astern. An increase in the weight of water is\r\nequivalent to an augmentation in the weight of our gun and its\r\ncarriage--of all that, in short, takes part in the recoil.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be urged, it is just the same thing to drive a large body\r\nof water astern at a slow speed as a small body at a high speed. This\r\nis the favorite fallacy of the advocates of hydraulic propulsion. The\r\nturbine or centrifugal pump put into the ship drives astern through\r\nthe nozzles at each side a comparatively small body of water at a very\r\nhigh velocity. In some early experiments we believe that a velocity of\r\n88 ft. per second, or 60 miles an hour, was maintained. A screw\r\npropeller operating with an enormously larger blade area than any pump\r\ncan have, drives astern at very slow speed a vast weight of water at\r\nevery revolution; therefore, unless it can be shown that the result is\r\nthe same whether we use high speed and small quantities or low speed\r\nand large quantities, the case of the hydraulic propeller is hopeless.\r\nBut this cannot be done. It is a fact, on the contrary, that the work\r\nwasted on the water increases in a very rapid ratio with its speed.\r\nThe work stored up in the moving water is expressed in foot pounds by\r\nthe formula\r\n\r\n  W v² / 2g\r\n\r\nwhere W stands for the weight of the water, and v for its velocity.\r\nBut the work stored in the water must have been derived from the\r\nengine; consequently the waste of engine power augments, not in the\r\nratio of the speed of the water, but in the ratio of the square of its\r\nspeed. Thus if a screw sends 100 tons of water astern at a speed of 10\r\nft. per second per second, the work wasted will be 156 foot tons per\r\nsecond in round numbers. If a hydraulic propeller sent 10 tons astern\r\nat 100 ft. per second per second, the work done on it would be 1,562\r\nfoot tons per second, or ten times as much. But the reaction effort,\r\nor thrust on the ship, would be the same in both cases. The waste of\r\nenergy would, under such circumstances, be ten times as great with the\r\nhydraulic propeller as with the screw. In other words, the slip would\r\nbe magnified in that proportion. Of course, it will be understood that\r\nwe are not taking into account resistances, and defects proper to the\r\nscrew, from which hydraulic propulsion is free, nor are we considering\r\ncertain drawbacks to the efficiency of the hydraulic propeller, from\r\nwhich the screw is exempt; all that we are dealing with is the waste\r\nof power in the shape of work done in moving water astern which we do\r\nnot want to move, but cannot help moving. If our readers have followed\r\nus so far, they will now understand the bearing of Rankine's\r\nproposition, that that propeller is best which moves the greatest\r\nquantity of water astern at the slowest speed. The weight of water\r\nmoved is one factor of the thrust, and consequently the greater that\r\nweight, other things being equal, the greater the propelling force\r\nbrought to bear on the ship.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, and with propriety, that the results obtained in\r\npractice with the jet propeller are more favorable than our reasoning\r\nwould indicate as possible; but it will be seen that we have taken no\r\nnotice of conditions which seriously affect the performance of a\r\nscrew. There is no doubt that it puts water in motion not astern. It\r\ntwists it up in a rope, so to speak. Its skin frictional resistance is\r\nvery great. In a word, in comparing the hydraulic system with the\r\nnormal system, we are comparing two very imperfect things together;\r\nbut the fact remains, and applies up to a certain point, that the\r\nhydraulic propeller must be very inefficient, because it, of all\r\npropellers, drives the smallest quantity of water astern at the\r\nhighest velocity.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, another and a very serious defect in the hydraulic\r\npropeller as usually made, which is that every ton of water passed\r\nthrough it has the velocity of the ship herself suddenly imparted to\r\nit. That is to say, the ship has to drag water with her. To illustrate\r\nour meaning, let us suppose that a canal boat passes below a stage or\r\nplatform a mile long, on which are arranged a series of sacks of corn.\r\nLet it further be supposed that as the canal boat passes along the\r\nplatform, at a speed of say five miles an hour, one sack shall be\r\ndropped into the boat and another dropped overboard continuously. It\r\nis evident that each sack, while it remains in the boat, will have a\r\nspeed the same as that of the boat, though it had none before. Work\r\nconsequently is done on each sack, in overcoming its inertia by\r\nimparting a velocity of five miles an hour to it, and all this work\r\nmust be done by the horse towing on the bank. In like manner the\r\nhydraulic propeller boat is continually taking in tons of water,\r\nimparting her own velocity to them, and then throwing them overboard.\r\nThe loss of efficiency from this source may become enormous. So great,\r\nindeed, is the resistance due to this cause that it precludes the\r\nnotion of anything like high speeds being attained. We do not mean to\r\nassert that a moderate degree of efficiency may not be got from\r\nhydraulic propulsion, but it can only be had by making the quantity of\r\nwater sent astern as great as possible and its velocity as small as\r\npossible. That is to say, very large nozzles must be employed. Again,\r\nprovision will have to be made for sending the water through the\r\npropeller in such a way that it shall have as little as possible of\r\nthe motion of the ship imparted to it. But as soon as we begin to\r\nreduce these principles to practice, it will be seen that we get\r\nsomething very like a paddle wheel hung in the middle of the boat and\r\nworking through an aperture in her hull, or else a screw propeller put\r\ninto a tube traversing her from stem to stern.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up by saying that the hydraulic propeller is less efficient\r\nthan the screw, because it does more work on the water and less on the\r\nboat; and that the boat in turn does more work on the water than does\r\none propelled by a screw, because she has to take in thousands of tons\r\nper hour and impart to them a velocity equal to her own. Part of this\r\nwork is got back again in a way sufficiently obvious, but not all. If\r\nit were all wasted, the efficiency of the hydraulic propeller would be\r\nso low that nothing would be heard about it, and we certainly should\r\nnot have written this article.--_The Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ARMY GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cut we give is from a photograph taken shortly after the recent\r\nfirings. The carriage upon which it is mounted is the one designed by\r\nthe Department and manufactured by the West Point Foundry, about six\r\nmonths since. It was designed as a proof carriage for this gun and\r\nalso for the 10 inch steel gun in course of construction. It is\r\nadapted to the larger gun by introducing two steel bushing rings\r\nfitted into the cheeks of carriage to secure the trunnion of the gun.\r\n\r\nThe gun represented is an 8 inch, all steel, breech-loading rifle,\r\nmanufactured by the West Point Foundry, upon designs from the Army\r\nOrdnance Bureau. The tube and jacket were obtained from Whitworth, and\r\nthe hoops and the breech mechanism forgings from the Midvale Steel\r\nCompany. The total weight of the gun is 13 tons; total length,\r\nincluding breech mechanism, 271 inches; length of bore in front of gas\r\ncheck, 30 calibers; powder space in chamber, 3,109 cubic inches;\r\ncharge, 100 pounds. The tube extends back to breech recess from\r\nmuzzle, in one solid piece. The breech block is carried in the jacket,\r\nthe thread cut in the rear portion of the jacket. The jacket extends\r\nforward and is shrunk over the tube about 87½ inches. The re-enforce\r\nis strengthened by two rows of steel hoops; the trunnion hoops form\r\none of the outer layers. In front of the jacket a single row of hoops\r\nis shrunk on the tube and extends toward the muzzle, leaving 91 inches\r\nof the muzzle end of the tube unhooped. The second row of hoops is\r\nshrunk on forward of the trunnion hoops for a length of 38 inches to\r\nstrengthen the gun, and the hoop portion forms three conical frustums.\r\nThe elastic resistance of the gun to tangential rupture over the\r\npowder chamber is computed by Claverino and kindred formulas to be\r\n54,000 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARMY 8 INCH STEEL GUN WITH CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe breech mechanism is modeled after the De Bange system. The block\r\nhas three smooth and three threaded sectors, and is locked in place by\r\none-sixth of a turn of a block, and secured by the eccentric end of a\r\nheavy lever, which revolves into a cut made in the rear breech of the\r\ngun. The gas check consists of a pad made of two steel plates or cups,\r\nbetween which is a pad of asbestos and mutton suet formed under heavy\r\npressure. The rifling consists of narrow grooves and bands, 45 of\r\neach. The depth of the groove is six one-hundredths of an inch.\r\n\r\nAlthough the gun is designed for a charge of 100 pounds, it is\r\nbelieved that it can be increased to 105 pounds without giving\r\ndangerous pressure, and the intention is to increase the charge to\r\nthat amount when the new powder is received from Du Pont.\r\n\r\nThe following is a very full synopsis of the official report of the\r\npreliminary firings--13 rounds--with this gun:\r\n\r\nThe first seven rounds were fired with German cocoa powder, which was\r\nreceived from Watervliet Arsenal. There were two kinds of cartridges,\r\none kind weighing 85 pounds, and having 30 grains in each layer, the\r\nother weighing 100 lb., and having 27 grains in each layer. In two of\r\nthe first seven rounds the weight of the charge was 65 pounds, the\r\nprojectiles weighing 182 and 286 pounds; in the next two rounds\r\ncharges of 85 pounds were fired, the projectiles, as before, weighing\r\n182 and 286 pounds, while in the last three of the rounds fired with\r\ncocoa powder the charge was 100 lb., while the weight of the\r\nprojectile was 182, 235, and 286 pounds. At the seventh round was\r\nfired the normal charge, 100 lb. of powder and a projectile weighing\r\n286 pounds, for which the gun was designed. The mean pressure for this\r\nround, determined by two crusher gauges, was 32,800 pounds, and the\r\nvelocity at 150 feet was 1,787 feet.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of Du Pont's brown prismatic powder, marked P.A. and P.I.,\r\nwere then fired. With the normal charge of P.A. powder (round 12 of\r\nthe record), the mean pressure was 35,450 pounds, the velocity at 150\r\nfeet was 1,812 feet. For P.I. powder (round 13 of the record), the\r\npressure was 26,925 pounds, the velocity was 1,702 feet, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of unconsumed powder was ejected, showing that the\r\nP.I. powder is not a suitable one for this piece. The highest pressure\r\nindicated with the normal charge of P.A. powder was 36,200 pounds,\r\nexceeding by 1,200 pounds the provisional limit of pressure.\r\n\r\nAt the fifth round the breech block opened with some difficulty, and\r\nan examination showed that the resistance resulted from the diametral\r\nenlargement of the rear plate. Directions have been given to correct\r\nthis defect. The star gauge records show that no material change took\r\nplace in the diameter of the chamber or the bore. From 30 inches to 54\r\ninches (measured from base of the breech), there was a diminution in\r\ndiameter of from 0.001 in. to 0.002 in.; in rear of 30 inches there\r\nwas no change. No enlargement in the shot chamber exceeded 0.001 in.\r\nFrom the bottom of the bore (the beginning of the rifling) to the\r\nmuzzle the average enlargements were as follows: in. to 6 in., 0.005\r\nin.; 7 in. to 14 in., 0.003 in.; 15 in. to 29 in., 0.002 in.; 30 in.\r\nto muzzle, 0.002 to 0.001 in.\r\n\r\nAfter the third round the joint between the D. and D. rings opened\r\nslightly on the top, and measured after the 13th round showed that the\r\nopening was about 0.004 in. wide. It cannot at present be stated\r\nwhether or not this opening increased during firing, but the defect\r\nhas been noted and will be carefully observed. Enough cocoa powder\r\nremains to allow a comparison to be made with such brown prismatic\r\npowder as may be adopted finally. No firing has been done as yet to\r\ntest the best position for the bands, but it will take place as soon\r\nas enough of some standard powder is obtained to fire ten consecutive\r\nrounds.--_Army and Navy Journal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBUSTION, FIRE-BOXES, AND STEAM BOILERS.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Address before the June Convention of the Master\r\n  Mechanics' Association.]\r\n\r\nBy JOHN A. COLEMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen: I was rash enough some time ago to promise\r\nto prepare a paper for this occasion, the fulfillment of which prior\r\nengagements have absolutely prevented.\r\n\r\nI would greatly prefer to be let off altogether, but I do not like to\r\nbreak down when expected to do anything; and if you have the patience\r\nto listen for a few minutes to the reflections of an \"outsider,\" I\r\nwill endeavor to put what I have to say in as concise form as I can,\r\nin such manner as will do no harm, even if it does no good.\r\n\r\nFor many years I was connected with steam engineering. I was once with\r\nthe Corliss Steam Engine Company, and afterward was the agent of Mr.\r\nJoseph Harrison, of Russian fame, for the introduction of his safety\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\nThat brought me into contact with the heavy manufacturers throughout\r\nthe Eastern States, and during that long experience I was particularly\r\nimpressed with a peculiarity common to the mill owners, which, I\r\nbelieve it may be said with truth, is equally common to those\r\ninterested in locomotive engineering, namely, how much we overlook\r\ncommon, every-day facts. For instance, we burn coal; that is, we think\r\nwe do, and boilers are put into mills and upon railroads, and we\r\nsuppose we are burning coal under them, when in reality we are only\r\npartially doing so. We think that because coal is consumed it\r\nnecessarily is burned, but such is frequently very far from the fact.\r\n\r\nI wish upon the present occasion to make merely a sort of general\r\nstatement of what I conceive to be combustion, and what I conceive to\r\nbe a boiler, and then to try to make a useful application of these\r\nideas to the locomotive.\r\n\r\nTreating first the subject of combustion, let us take the top of the\r\ngrate-bars as our starting point. When we shovel coal upon the grate\r\nbars and ignite it, what happens first? We separate the two\r\nconstituents of coal, the carbon from the hydrogen. We make a gas\r\nworks. Carbon by itself will burn no more than a stone; neither will\r\nhydrogen. It requires a given number of equivalents of oxygen to mix\r\nwith so many equivalents of carbon, and a given number of equivalents\r\nof oxygen to mix with so many of hydrogen to form that union which is\r\nnecessary to produce heat. This requires time, space, and air, and one\r\nthing more, viz., heat.\r\n\r\nI presume that most of you have read Charles Williams' treatise upon\r\n\"Combustion,\" which was published many years ago, and which until\r\nrecently was often quoted as an absolute authority upon the art of\r\nburning fuel under boilers. Mr. Williams in his treatise accurately\r\ndescribes the chemistry of combustion, but he has misled the world for\r\nfifty years by an error in reasoning and the failure to discuss a\r\ncertain mechanical fact connected with the combination of gases in the\r\nprocess of combustion. He said: \"What is the use of heating the air\r\nput into a furnace? If you take a cubic foot of air, it contains just\r\nso many atoms of oxygen, neither more nor less. If the air be heated,\r\nyou cause it to assume double its volume, but you have not added a\r\nsingle atom of oxygen, and you will require twice the space for its\r\npassage between the grate bars, and twice the space in the furnace,\r\nwhich is a nuisance; but if the air could be frozen, it would be\r\ncondensed, and more atoms of oxygen could be crowded into the cubic\r\nfoot, and the fire would receive a corresponding advantage.\" Mr.\r\nWilliams proceeded upon this theory, and died without solving the\r\nperplexing mystery of as frequent failure as success which attended\r\nhis experiments with steamship boilers. The only successes which he\r\nobtained were misleading, because they were made with boilers so badly\r\nproportioned for their work that almost any change would produce\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nSuccessful combustion requires something more than the necessary\r\nchemical elements of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, for it requires\r\nsomething to cook the elements, so to speak, and that is heat, and for\r\nthis reason: When the coal is volatilized in the furnace, what would\r\nbe a cubic foot of gas, if cold, is itself heated and its volume\r\nincreased to double its normal proportion. It is thin and attenuated.\r\nThe cold air which is introduced to the furnace is denser than the\r\ngas. With dampers wide open in the chimney, and the gases and air\r\npassing into the flues with a velocity of 40 feet per second, they\r\nstrike the colder surface of the tubes, and are cooled below the point\r\nof combustion before they have had time to become assimilated; and\r\nalthough an opponent in a debate upon steam boiler tests once stated\r\nthat his thermometer in the chimney showed only 250 degrees, and\r\nindicated that all the value that was practical had been obtained from\r\nthe coal, I took the liberty to maintain that a chemist might have\r\nanalyzed the gases and shown there were dollars in them; and that if\r\nthe thermometer had been removed from the chimney and placed in the\r\npile of coal outside the boiler, it would have gone still lower; but\r\nit would not have proved the value to have been extracted from the\r\ncoal, for it was not the complete test to apply.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things in the furnace may be illustrated thus: If we\r\nshould mingle a quart of molasses and a gallon of water, it would\r\nrequire considerable manipulation and some time to cause them to\r\nunite. Why? Because one element is so much denser than the other; but\r\nif we should mix a quart of the gallon of water with the quart of\r\nmolasses, and render their densities somewhere near the density of the\r\nremaining water, and then pour the masses together, there would be a\r\nmore speedy commingling of the two. And so with the furnace. I have\r\nalways maintained that every furnace should be lined with fire-brick,\r\nin order that it shall be so intensely hot when the air enters that\r\nthe air shall instantly be heated to the same degree of tenuity as the\r\nhot gases themselves, and the two will then unite like a flash--and\r\nthat is heat. And here is the solution of the Wye Williams mystery of\r\nfailure when cold air was introduced upon the top of a fire to aid\r\ncombustion. The proof of the necessity for heat to aid the chemical\r\nassimilation of the volatilized coal elements is seen in starting a\r\nfire in a common stove. At first there is only a blue flame, in which\r\nthe hand may be held; but wait until the lining becomes white hot, and\r\nthen throw on a little coal, and you will find a totally different\r\nresult. It is also seen in the Siemens gas furnace, with which you are\r\ndoubtless familiar. There is the introduction of gas with its\r\nnecessary complement of air. Until the furnace and retorts become\r\nheated, the air and gas flutter through only partially united, and do\r\nlittle good; but as soon as the retorts and furnace become thoroughly\r\nhot, the same gas and air will melt a fire-brick.\r\n\r\nThese are common phenomena, which are familiar, but apt to be\r\nunnoticed; but they logically point to the truth that no furnaces\r\nshould present a cooling medium in contact with fuel which is\r\nundergoing this process of digestion, so to speak. It will be very\r\nevident, I think, from these facts that water-legs in direct contact\r\nwith a fire are a mistake. They tend to check a fire as far as their\r\ninfluence extends, as a thin sheet of ice upon the stomach after\r\ndinner would check digestion, and for the same reason, namely, the\r\nabstraction of heat from a chemical process. If fire-brick could be\r\nlaid around a locomotive furnace, and the grate, of course, kept of\r\nthe same area as before, it is my belief that a very important\r\nadvantage would be at once apparent. An old-fashioned cast iron heater\r\nalways produced a treacherous fire. It would grow dead around the\r\noutside next to the cold iron; but put a fire-clay lining into it, and\r\nit was as good as any other stove.\r\n\r\nIf I have now made clear what I mean by making heat, we will next\r\nconsider the steam boiler. What is a steam boiler? It is a thing to\r\nabsorb heat. The bottom line of this science is the bottom of a pot\r\nover a fire, which is the best boiler surface in the world; there is\r\nwater upon one side of a piece of iron and heat against the other. One\r\nsquare foot of the iron will transmit through it a given number of\r\nunits of heat into the water at a given temperature in a given time;\r\ntwo square feet twice as many, and three, three times as many, and so\r\non. Put a cover upon the pot, and seal it tight, leave an orifice for\r\nthe steam, and that is a steam boiler with all its mysteries.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned, plain cylinder boiler is a plain cylindrical pot\r\nover the fire. If enough plain cylinder boilers presenting the\r\nrequisite number of square feet of absorbing surface are put into a\r\ncotton mill, experience has shown that they will make a yard of cotton\r\ncloth about as cheaply as tubular boilers. If this is so, why do not\r\nall put them in? Because it is the crudest and most expensive form of\r\nboiler when its enormous area of ground, brickwork, and its fittings\r\nare considered. Not all have the money or the room for them. To\r\nproduce space, the area is drawn in sidewise and lengthwise, but we\r\nmust have the necessary amount of square feet of absorbing surface,\r\nconsequently the boiler is doubled up, so to speak, and we have a\r\n\"flue boiler.\" We draw in sidewise and lengthwise once more and double\r\nup the surface again, and that is a \"tubular boiler.\" That includes\r\nall the \"mystery\" on that subject.\r\n\r\nNow, we find among the mills, just as I imagine we should upon the\r\nrailroads, that the almost universal tendency is to put in too small\r\nboilers and furnaces. To skimp at boilers is to spend at the coal\r\nyard. Small boilers mean heavy and over-deep fires, and rapid\r\ndestruction of apparatus. In sugar houses you will see this frequently\r\nillustrated, and will find 16 inch fires upon their grates.\r\n\r\nWe have found that, as we could persuade mill owners to put in more\r\nboilers and extend their furnaces, so that coal could be burned\r\nmoderately and time for combustion afforded, we often saved as high as\r\n1,000 tons in a yearly consumption of 4,000.\r\n\r\nNow, when the ordinary locomotive sends particles of coal into the\r\ncars in which I am riding, I do not think it would be unfair criticism\r\nto say that the process of combustion was not properly carried out.\r\nWhen we see dense volumes of gas emitted from the stack, it is evident\r\nthat a portion of the hard dollars which were paid for the coal are\r\nbeing uselessly thrown into the air; and it will be well to remember\r\nthat only a little of the unburnt gas is visible to the eye.\r\n\r\nOne point I wish to make is this: We find, as I have said, that as we\r\nspread out with boilers and furnaces in the mills, so that we can take\r\nmatters deliberately, we save money.\r\n\r\nNow, coming again to locomotives. I think, if we examine the subject\r\ncarefully, the fact will strike us a little curiously. The first\r\nlocomotive built in Philadelphia weighed about 14 tons. Judging from\r\nthe cut I have seen, I should think her furnace might have been 30\r\ninches square. We have gone from that little 14 ton engine to machines\r\nof 50 and 60 tons--perhaps more. The engines have been increased over\r\nfour times, but I will ask you if the furnace areas have been\r\nincreased (applause) in proportion? Some of the furnaces of the\r\nengines are six feet by three, but that is an increase of less than 3\r\nto 1 of furnace, as against 4 to 1 of weight of engine.\r\n\r\nWhen my attention was first called to this matter, I had supposed, as\r\nmost people do who are outside of the railway profession, that there\r\nwas something subtile and mysterious about railway engineering that\r\nnone but those brought up to the business could understand. Possibly\r\nit is so, and I am merely making suggestions for what they are worth,\r\nbut I think the position I have taken in this matter was established\r\nby some experiments of three weeks' duration, which I conducted\r\nbetween Milan and Como, in Italy, for the Italian government, in\r\npulling freight trains up grades of 100 feet to the mile. The\r\nexperiments were made with an engine built by the Reading Railroad.\r\n\r\nWe competed with English, French, Belgian, and Austrian engines. These\r\nmachines required the best of fuel to perform the mountain service,\r\nand could use coal dust only when it was pressed into brick. We used\r\nin the Reading Railroad machine different fuels upon different days,\r\nmaking the road trip of 120 miles each day with one kind of fuel. We\r\nused coal dust scraped up in the yards, also the best Cardiff coal,\r\nanthracite, and five kinds of Italian lignite, the best of which\r\npossesses about half the combustible value of coal.\r\n\r\nThe results in drawing heavy freight trains were equally good with\r\neach fuel, the engine having at all times an abundance of steam on\r\nheavy grades, no smoke nor cinders, and no collection of cinders in\r\nthe forward part of the engine.\r\n\r\nThe fireman arranged his fires at a station, and did little or nothing\r\nexcept to smoke his pipe and enjoy the scenery until he reached the\r\nnext station. An incident occurred to prove that we were not playing\r\nwith the machine. They told me one morning that we should be given a\r\nload of 25 per cent less than the maximum load of an engine of her\r\nclass (30 tons). We started up the 100 foot grade, and found we could\r\nbarely crawl, and our engineer got furious over it. He thought they\r\nwere repeating a trick already attempted by screwing down a brake in\r\nascending a grade. We detected it, however, and found a pair of wheels\r\nnearly red hot. Upon this occasion we found nothing amiss, except full\r\ncars where they had reported only a light load. We pulled to the top\r\nof the hill, the steam blowing off furiously all the time.\r\n\r\nThis was a new experience to the Italians, and might surprise some\r\nAmericans. When we arrived at the station, the inspector-general and\r\nhis corps of engineers were evidently amazed, and it was evident we\r\nhad captured them. He said to me, \"I can congratulate you, signor, on\r\npossession of a superb machine.\"\r\n\r\nAfterward one of the engineers said to me: \"Do not let it be known\r\nthat I told you what you have hauled or I shall lose my place, but you\r\nhave drawn 50 per cent more than the maximum load of one of our 40 ton\r\nengines.\" I said: \"You attempted to 'stall' us, and when you try it\r\nagain, be fair enough to give me a flat of pig iron, and as you pack\r\ncars on one end I will pack pig iron upon the engine until she will\r\nstick to the track, but rest assured that you will not be able to get\r\nthat steam down.\" The experience with that engine proves conclusively\r\nto my mind that the general principles of steam making are the same\r\nfor both stationary and locomotive practice. The grand secret of the\r\nsuccess of that Wootten engine was the enormous area of the grate\r\nsurface, being, if I remember correctly, 7 by 9 feet, permitting thin\r\nfires to be carried and complete combustion to be obtained before the\r\ngases reached the boiler tubes. An enormous crown sheet was presented,\r\nand that is where the bulk of the work of any boiler is done.\r\n\r\nThin fires accomplish this. As already stated, a given amount of coal\r\ngenerates a given amount of gas, and this gas requires a given amount\r\nof air or oxygen. This air must be supplied through the grate bars and\r\nthen pass through the interstices of the mass of heated coal. It\r\nrequires about 10 cubic feet of air to consume one cubic foot of gas.\r\nIn stationary boilers we find that if we use \"pea\" and \"dust\" coal, an\r\nextremely thin layer must be used, or the 10 feet of air per foot of\r\ngas cannot pass through it; if \"chestnut\" coal be used, the thickness\r\nmay be increased somewhat; \"stove size\" allows a thickness of six\r\ninches, and \"lump\" much thicker, if any wise man could be found who\r\nwould use that coarse, uneconomical size. Of course, I am speaking of\r\nanthracite coal. Opinions differ about \"soft coal,\" but the same\r\ngeneral principle applies as regards an unobstructed passage of air\r\nthrough the hot bed of coal.\r\n\r\nNow, it will be agreed that the locomotive of the future must be\r\nimproved to keep up with the times. Fierce competition requires\r\nincreased efficiency and reduced expenses. I am told by you railroad\r\ngentlemen that the freight business of the country doubles every ten\r\nyears. Trains follow close upon each other. What are you going to do?\r\nAre you to double, treble, or quadruple your tracks?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me much remains yet to be done with the locomotive. We\r\nmust burn a great deal less coal for the steam we make, and after we\r\nhave made steam we must use that steam up more thoroughly. In the\r\nshort cylinder required by locomotive service, the steam, entering at\r\nthe initial pressure pushes the piston to the opposite end, and it\r\nthen rushes out of the exhaust strong enough to drive another piston.\r\nOf every four dollars' worth of coal consumed, at least two dollars\r\nworth is absolutely thrown away. Or, of every ten thousand dollars\r\nspent for fuel, five thousand dollars are absolutely wasted. How can\r\nwe save this? It would seem obvious that if steam rushes from the\r\nexhaust of an engine strong enough to drive another engine, the common\r\nsense of the thing would be to put another engine alongside and let\r\nthe steam drive it, and we should get just so much more out of our\r\nfour dollars' worth of coal. It seems evident that we must follow the\r\nlead of the steamship men, and compound the locomotive engine, as\r\nthey have done with the marine engine.\r\n\r\nNext we must attack the extravagant furnace, and increase its area and\r\nreduce the depth of the bed of coal. The difficulty of making this\r\nchange seemed to me to be removed, on examining an engine on the\r\nProvidence & Bristol Railroad, the other day. The machine was made at\r\nthe Mason Works, of Taunton. It was an engine and tender combined, the\r\ntruck being at the rear end of the tender, and the driver placed well\r\nin advance of the fire-box, so that the maximum weight of both engine\r\nand tender rested upon the drivers. In thus removing the drivers from\r\nthe proximity of the fire-box, abundant facility is afforded for\r\nwidening the fire-box, so as to obtain a grate area as large as that\r\nof the Wootten engine or of a stationary boiler. It seems to me the\r\nincrease of grate area can be obtained only by widening; for a length\r\nof more than six or seven feet is very hard upon the fireman. You\r\ncertainly cannot get more power by deepening present fire-boxes,\r\nexcept by an enormously increased waste of fuel, which all will\r\nconcede is already sufficiently extravagant.\r\n\r\nIn arriving at the conclusion of these hasty and I fear somewhat\r\nincoherent remarks, I would say that the object aimed at for the\r\nimprovement of the locomotive would be reached, first, by making steam\r\neconomically, by employing such increased grate area as will permit\r\nrunning thin fires and moderate or comparatively slow draught; and,\r\nsecondly, in economically using the steam which has been economically\r\nmade by compounding the engine.\r\n\r\nI have given you merely the views of an \"outsider,\" who has had a\r\nsomewhat extensive experience in stationary engineering, and who has\r\nobserved locomotive practice in many parts of the world. These views\r\nare offered for what they are worth, as suggestions for future thought\r\nin designing engines, and as a sort of refresher upon rudimentary\r\npoints which long familiarity with every-day phenomena causes us at\r\ntimes to overlook. I trust that your deliberations may aid in the\r\nspeedy reduction of the expenses of transporting freight and\r\npassengers, for the benefit of the railroad companies and, in their\r\nturn, the advantage of the people at large.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTIC STEAMERS.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: A paper recently read before the Institution of Naval\r\n  Architects.]\r\n\r\nBy W. JOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1--CITY OF ROME.]\r\n\r\nThe author said that he hoped to bring before the meeting impartially\r\ncertain facts which might be of interest, and which, when recorded in\r\nthe pages of the \"Transactions,\" might be found of some use as data\r\nfor future reference. In dealing with passenger steamers, he would do\r\nso principally from a shipbuilder's point of view; but the moment he\r\ncommenced to think over Atlantic passenger ships as a shipbuilder, he\r\nwas met by the question whether the present tendency toward divorcing\r\nthe passenger and cargo trade from each other is likely to continue or\r\nnot. If the answer is yes, then it seems to become an important\r\nquestion, for the present at least, how to build, on moderately small\r\ndimensions, the fastest, safest, and most economical passenger\r\nsteamer, using all the most modern improvements to make her commodious\r\nand luxurious, and an easy sea boat into the bargain. If cargo is\r\nstill to be carried in the passenger ships of the future, a moderate\r\nspeed only will be aimed at in the immediate future, and every effort\r\nwill be devoted to economy of fuel, comfort, and safety, with a fair\r\ncarrying capacity. This latter policy is one which may possibly\r\nprevail at least for a time, as it has powerful supporters in\r\nLiverpool; but he could not help thinking that very high\r\nspeeds--higher than we have yet attained--must eventually gain the\r\nday. He also thought that they were on the eve of important movements,\r\nwhich will indicate what the next step in the passenger trade is to\r\nbe; for it must be remembered, among other things, that none of our\r\npresent English transatlantic liners, even the latest, have yet been\r\nfitted with the latest modern improvements for economy of fuel or\r\nquick combustion, such as triple expansion engines or forced draught.\r\nThey must, therefore, be at some disadvantage, other things being\r\nequal, compared with the ships of the future possessing them. The\r\nGreat Eastern steaming up Milford Haven about twenty-five years ago\r\nbetween two lines of the channel fleet of old--two and three decked\r\nwooden line-of-battle ships--the whole fleet saluting with yards\r\nmanned, was a sight to be remembered. More than this, that ship, with\r\nall her mournful career, has been a useful lesson and a useful warning\r\nto all naval architects who seriously study their profession--a lesson\r\nof what can be done in the safe construction of huge floating\r\nstructures, and a warning that the highest flights of constructive\r\ngenius may prove abortive if not strictly subordinated to the\r\npractical conditions and commercial requirements of the times. The\r\nSirius and Great Western crossed the Atlantic in 1838, and in 1840 the\r\nfirst ship of the since celebrated Cunard Company made her first\r\nvoyage. This was the Britannia, which, with her sister ships, the\r\nArcadia, Caledonia, and Columbia, kept up the mail service regularly\r\nat a speed of about 8½ knots an hour. The Britannia was 207 ft. in\r\nlength between perpendiculars, and 34 ft. 4 in. extreme breadth, 22\r\nft. 6 in. depth of hold, 423 horse power--nominal--and 1,153 tons\r\nburden, built of wood, and propelled by paddles. In 1860 the Collins\r\nLine started in opposition to the Cunard, and, after a series of\r\ndisasters, collapsed in 1858. This was three years after the Persia,\r\nthe first Cunarder built of iron, had been completed. In 1850, also,\r\nthe Inman Line was started with the City of Glasgow, of 1,600 tons\r\nbuilders' measurement, and 350 horse power. She was built of iron, and\r\nwas the first screw steamer sent across the Atlantic from Liverpool\r\nwith passengers, and was the pioneer of the great emigrant trade which\r\nMr. Inman, above all others, did so much to develop and make cheap and\r\ncomfortable for the emigrants themselves, as well as profitable to his\r\ncompany. That the builders of the celebrated old Great Britain, in\r\n1843, and Mr. Inman, in 1850, should have pronounced so decisively in\r\nfavor of the screw propeller in preference to the paddle for ocean\r\nsteaming is a proof of their true practical judgment, which time and\r\npractical experience have made abundantly clear. While the Cunard\r\nCompany went on developing its fleet from the early wood paddle\r\nsteamer Britannia of 1,130 tons in 1840 to the iron paddle steamers\r\nPersia, etc., in 1858, the iron screw steamer China of 1862, to the\r\nstill more important screw steamers Bothnia and Scythia, vessels of\r\n4,335 tons, in 1874, the Inman and other lines were as rapidly\r\ndeveloping in speed and size, if not in numbers. The year 1874 is\r\nmemorable, for it saw the White Star steamers Britannic and Germanic\r\nput into the water, as well as the Inman steamer City of Berlin and\r\nthe two before mentioned Cunard steamers, Bothnia and Scythia. By the\r\naddition of these two ships to their fleet the White Star Line,\r\nalthough started only in 1870, reached a front rank position in the\r\nNew York passenger trade. The author gave in separate tables the logs\r\nof several of these ships, some from published documents and some\r\nkindly furnished by the owners. The Great Western had crossed the\r\nAtlantic from Bristol to New York in 15 days as early as 1838. The\r\nfirst Cunard steamer, the Britannic, was about the same speed, from 8¼\r\nto 8½ knots an hour. The average duration of the Cunard voyages in the\r\nyear 1856 was 12.67 days from Liverpool to New York, and 11.03 days\r\nfrom New York to Liverpool. The Bothnia, in 1874, reduced the passage\r\nto about nine days. The White Star Britannic, in 1876, averaged 7 days\r\n18 hours 26 minutes outward from Queenstown to New York, and 9 days 6\r\nhours 44 minutes homeward, and has averaged for the last ten years 8\r\ndays 9 hours 36 minutes outward, and 8 days 1 hour 48 minutes\r\nhomeward. The City of Berlin, of the Inman Line, also built in 1874, 8\r\ndays 10 hours 56 minutes, and homeward 8 days 2 hours 37 minutes; and\r\nfor the nine years from 1875 to 1883 inclusive, averaged outward 8\r\ndays 19 hours 56 seconds, and inward 8 days 8 hours 34 seconds; or,\r\nputting it into rounder figures, the Britannic had reduced the average\r\npassage between the two points to 8¼ days, and the City of Berlin to\r\n8½ days. From the year 1874 on to 1879 no further advance was made in\r\nAtlantic steaming, but in that year the Arizona was added to the Guion\r\nLine, and it soon became evident that another important stride had\r\nbeen made in the Atlantic passenger trade, which would lead to most\r\nimportant results. The results, as we all know, have been sufficiently\r\nstartling. The Guion Line, which had started in 1866 with the\r\nManhattan, had now the fastest passenger ship on the Atlantic. In\r\nspite of burning some fifty per cent. more coal than the Britannic,\r\nthe ship was an obvious commercial success. The spirited policy which\r\nbrought her into existence was appreciated by the public, and the\r\nother lines had to move forward. Then followed a period of rivalry,\r\nthe Cunard Company building the Gallia and Servia, the Inman Company\r\nthe City of Rome, and the Guion Line the Alaska, all of which were\r\ncompleted in 1881, and afterward the Oregon for the Guion\r\nLine--1883--the Aurania the same year for the Cunard Company, and,\r\nlater still, the America for the National Line, and the Umbria and\r\nEtruria for the Cunard Company in 1885.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Frames from outer edge of Tank to Upper Deck, 7 × 3½ × 8/16 for 250\r\nft.

Taking the Britannic as a standard with\r\nher ten years' average of 8¼ days across, and her quickest passage of\r\n7 days 10 hours 53 seconds, we have now the following steamers of\r\nhigher speeds. Taking them in the order of their absolutely fastest\r\npassage out or home, they stand thus:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n  ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------\r\n     |                         | Days.| Hours.| Mins.\r\n     |                         +------+-------+------\r\n   1 | Etruria.                |   6  |   5   |  31\r\n   2 | Umbria (sister ship).   |   slightly longer.\r\n   3 | Oregon.                 |   6  |  10   |  35\r\n   4 | America.                |   6  |  13   |  44\r\n   5 | City of Rome.           |   6  |  18   |   0\r\n   6 | Alaska.                 |   6  |  18   |  37\r\n   7 | Servia.                 |   6  |  23   |  55\r\n   8 | Aurania.                |   7  |   1   |   1\r\n  ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that from the 15 days' passage or thereabout, of\r\nthe earliest Atlantic steamers, we had got down in the days of the\r\nScotia to about 9 days; in the Britannic to 8¼ days, and, at the\r\npresent time, we have got to 6¼ days, with seven ships afloat that\r\nhave done the passage under seven days, and capable of making their\r\naverage passages range between 6½ and 7¼ days.\r\n\r\nRanged in order of gross tonnage, these eight vessels stand as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n  1. City of Rome.    8,144\r\n  2. Oregon.          7,375\r\n  3. Aurania.         7,269\r\n  4. Servia.          7,212\r\n  5. Umbria.          7,129\r\n  6. Etruria.         7,100\r\n  7. Alaska.          6,586\r\n  8. America.         5,528\r\n\r\nHere the America shows to advantage, for while being eighth in size\r\nshe is fourth in point of speed, and from what the author can learn,\r\nalthough he had no authenticated details on the subject, he believed\r\nshe is economical in coal consumption. He might perhaps be permitted\r\nto say that one of the most difficult subjects in connection with the\r\npropulsion of ships on which to get absolutely accurate data is that\r\nof coal consumption. The records of six to eight hours' trials for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the coal consumption are absolutely worthless,\r\nas all shipbuilders and engineers know, and so far as English ships\r\nare concerned they are never attempted. Foreign owners frequently\r\nstipulate for such trials in their contracts with English\r\nshipbuilders, and get wonderfully economical results on paper, but the\r\nfact that the trials only extend over a few hours renders them\r\nvalueless, however carefully the coal may be weighed during that\r\nperiod. An authentic record of the absolute quantity of coal consumed,\r\nsay by each of the eight fastest Atlantic liners, together with their\r\naverage indicated horse power on the voyage, for a series of voyages,\r\nwould be extremely valuable.\r\n\r\nHe gave, in Table III., the consumption per indicated horse power per\r\nhour for a number of ships. This table affords valuable data, for it\r\ngives, in addition to the dimensions, the moulded draught of water,\r\nthe midship area, the displacement, the indicated horse power, the\r\nspeed on trial, the coefficients for the lines both from the block or\r\nparallelopipedon, and also from the midship section prism, together\r\nwith the length and angle of entrance obtained by Kirk's rule, the\r\nAdmiralty displacement coefficient, together with the coal consumption\r\nper day and per indicated horse power per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3--OREGON.]\r\n\r\nThis table, as will be seen, contains some of the most important of\r\nthe Atlantic liners, and also a number of other typical ships, which\r\nwill add a variety to its interest and a value to it. The coefficient,\r\nwhich is contained in the thirteenth column of the table, viz.:\r\n\r\n        Dis 2/3 × speed³\r\n    -------------------------\r\n    I.H.P. × sqrt(entrance.)\r\n             ---------------\r\n                     10\r\n\r\ngenerally comes out for ships of similar type more nearly a constant\r\nin the true sense of the word than the corresponding Admiralty\r\nconstant. As an example, we have the curves of resistance and horse\r\npower for the City of Rome and the Normandie, a large vessel of 6,000\r\ntons, which the Barrow Company built for the Compagnie Generale\r\nTransatlantique, in which the coefficient of fineness and the form of\r\nthe lines pretty closely resemble each other below water; and if we\r\ntake from the curves the corresponding speeds and horse powers, and\r\nwork out the constants by the two systems, we have at 14 knots the\r\nAdmiralty constant for the City of Rome 322.2, and for the Normandie\r\n304.8; and taking for a modified form of constant, the City of Rome\r\ngives 253.7 and the Normandie 251.9, which, as will be seen, are much\r\ncloser together. Similarly, at 15 knots the Admiralty constant for the\r\nCity of Rome is 310, and for the Normandie 295.2, while a modified\r\nconstant comes out for the former at 245, and for the latter 244,\r\nagain agreeing almost identically. The same at 16 knots, for the City\r\nof Rome the Admiralty constant comes out 297.6, and for the Normandie\r\n282.8, while a modified constant comes out for the two ships 234.4 and\r\n233.7 respectively, again showing marked agreement. It may be\r\nmentioned that in these two ships the engines are of a similar type,\r\nbeing three-crank tandem engines, and the propellers have in both\r\npitch and surface practically the same proportions to the power and\r\nspeed. The value of these modified constants will probably be found to\r\nincrease as the speeds increase up to the limit and beyond that point\r\nat which wave resistance becomes an important factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\n----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------+-------------+\r\n    Name.       |Length. | Breadth.| Moulded |Midship|Displacement.|\r\n                |

ship is exposed, and\r\nstated that he had before him the calculations for three of the\r\nlargest vessels, two of them of iron and the other of steel; and he\r\nfound, in the case of the iron, the maximum tension on the gunwale\r\nduring the greatest hogging strains likely to be endured at sea would\r\nnot exceed about six tons per square inch, while in the case of the\r\nsteel ship it is only about 6½ tons. These strains are well within the\r\nlimits of safety, and a comparison of the scantlings of these with the\r\nothers justifies the assertion as to their general safety from a\r\nstructural point of view. The sections of these three ships are shown\r\nin Figs. 1, 2, and 3, with their principal scantlings. It will be seen\r\nfrom these sections that the three ships differ materially in their\r\nmode of construction. In the case of Fig. 1, which represents the City\r\nof Rome, the largest of the three, it will be seen that the main\r\nframing of the vessel is entirely transverse, with very heavy keelsons\r\nin the bottom, and large partial bulkheads or web frames, and the\r\noutside plating arranged on what is termed the edge to edge principle,\r\nwith a great portion of it double. In the next section, Fig. 2, the\r\nServia, which is built of steel, on the other hand, the bottom is\r\nbuilt on the longitudinal cellular system, the first application, he\r\nbelieved, of this system to an Atlantic liner. The plating of the\r\nServia is of the usual alternate outer and inner strake system, partly\r\ndouble; while the third section, the Oregon, approaches more nearly to\r\nthe ordinary system of framing and plating usually adopted, but it\r\nwill be seen that she was well tied in the bottom by very heavy\r\nintercostal and plate keelsons, as well as in the top by heavy\r\nstringers and sheer strakes, with much of her plating doubled, and\r\nheavy web frames inside. The author next considered the question of\r\nstability, and went on to deal with the subject of twin screws, and\r\nstated that the Barrow Shipbuilding Company has done more in the way\r\nof planning and designing for the adoption of twin screws lately than\r\nfor any other mode of propulsion, and this chiefly for passenger\r\nsteamers. He did not attach much importance to the particular form of\r\nthe blade either in single or twin screws, as he believed so long as\r\nthe disk area, the surface, and pitch were properly adjusted to the\r\nspeed of the vessel, and to enable the engines to use, at the maximum\r\nspeed, just the full quantity of steam that the boilers can make, we\r\nhave got pretty nearly as far as we can get. To fix these dimensions\r\nof the propeller accurately at the present time, and without further\r\nknowledge of the action of the screw on the water, was, he thought,\r\nimpossible. All the rules and formulæ are empirical. The best one he\r\nknew is given in Table IV., due to Mr. Thom, the head of the Barrow\r\nCompany's engineering drawing office, and at present acting manager,\r\nwho has used it for some years in practice. These formulæ are based\r\nupon the assumption that the area of propeller disk should be\r\nproportional to the indicated horse power, divided by the cube of the\r\nspeed, and the same with the projected area of the propeller and also\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.\r\n\r\n             _Particulars of Propellers and Constants._\r\n\r\n------------------------------+-------+---------+----------+--------------\r\n                              | Length|         |   Proj.  |  Feet per\r\n            Ship.             |   of  |  Disk   |   surf.  |   minute.\r\n                              | ship. |constant.| constant.|Speed of tips.\r\n------------------------------+-------+---------+----------+--------------\r\nCity of Rome.                 |   542 |   220   |    69    |   4,715\r\nNormandie                     |   459 |   250   |    66    |   4,099\r\nFurnessia                     |   445 |   223   |    69    |   3,654\r\nEden                          |   300 |   211   |    64    |   3,080\r\nYorouba                       |   270 |   213   |    63    |   3,202\r\nTaygete                       |   260 |   238   |    56    |   3,166\r\nKow-shing                     |   250 |   171   |    69    |   3,369\r\nS.Y.

He said that if\r\nthey were to have greater speed on the Atlantic, there was one point\r\nwhich was not alluded to in the paper, and that was the total\r\nabolition of cargo on board the great passenger steamers. If vessels\r\nwere built solely for passenger traffic, they would be able to insure\r\ngreater speed by reason of the greater slightness in build and the\r\nadditional space at the command of the designer. The existing Atlantic\r\nexpress steamer was far too heavy, and might, if cargo was dispensed\r\nwith, be made with finer lines and more yacht-like. He looked on the\r\nproposition to fit such vessels with longitudinal bulkheads with great\r\nfear. If a collision took place--such, for example, as that which sunk\r\nthe Oregon--water would get access to one side only of the ship, and\r\nit was not at all improbable that if a sea was on, she would turn\r\nright over. At all events, very serious risk would be involved.\r\n\r\nMr. W.H. White, Chief Constructor to the Admiralty, said the question\r\nof twin screw propulsion was one of special interest to himself, and\r\nhad been so for many years. In 1878 he dealt with it as fully as he\r\nthen could on the basis of the Admiralty data, and he then ventured to\r\nsay everything in favor of twin screws that Mr. John had said in his\r\npaper. If greater power than that now used in such a ship as the\r\nEtruria, for example, were demanded, two screws must be used. Good as\r\nare the results obtained with the Etruria, it was by no means certain\r\nthat still better might not be had. If she had been fitted with two\r\nscrews instead of one, very great advantage would be gained by the\r\ngreater submergence of the twin screws, as thus racing would be almost\r\nwholly prevented.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert urged that more attention should be devoted to studying\r\nthe relative values of different portions of the propeller.\r\n\r\nThe sitting was then suspended. In the afternoon, as we have already\r\nstated, the members visited the steamship Germanic on the invitation\r\nof Messrs. Ismay, Imrie & Co., subsequently proceeding to Messrs. Cope\r\nBrothers' tobacco works, and thence to the exhibition, where the\r\ndinner of the Institution took place in the evening.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning no paper was read; some official business was\r\ntransacted, and this being done, the discussion on Mr. John's paper\r\nwas resumed.\r\n\r\nMr. Biles remarked that there were many advantages in the use of twin\r\nscrews which had not been sufficiently taken into account. When a ship\r\nwith twin screws was being handled in dock there was greater\r\nmaneuvering power, and therefore less liability for the ship to come\r\nin contact with the walls, although, if she did so, there would be\r\ngreater probability of damage to the propellers. He thought means\r\ncould be easily devised of protecting the screws when the ship was in\r\ndock. Another of the incidental advantages connected with twin screws\r\nwas that smaller engines and smaller propellers were required, and\r\ntherefore they might run them at a higher speed. They would also get\r\nlighter machinery with twin screws, and there would be less liability\r\nto have bad castings and forgings in the smaller engines, and of\r\ncourse the cost would be less.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the question of the middle line bulkheads, he could\r\nnot quite agree with Mr. John as to the great advantages of them in a\r\nbig passenger steamer. He thought there would be greater difficulty in\r\nmanaging a ship so built if she was in danger of sinking. Increased\r\nsubdivision in a longitudinal direction was a very desirable thing,\r\nand almost necessary for a condition of immunity from sinking. In\r\nfuture Atlantic steamers longitudinal bulkheads should be placed not\r\nin the middle line, but nearer the sides of the ships, and they should\r\nrecognize the fact that they had engines and boilers in different\r\ncompartments, and make arrangements whereby the ship would still\r\nfloat, although the doors in these compartments were kept open. The\r\nproper way to arrive at that was to have a ship with great beam, and\r\nto have two longitudinal bulkheads at considerable distances from the\r\nsides of the ship, subdivided as completely as possible, both under\r\nand above water, so that, even supposing they got water into the space\r\nbetween one bulkhead and the side of the ship, they would have\r\nsufficient buoyancy in the other parts of the ship to keep her afloat.\r\nBroad ships must necessarily mean deep ships, in order to have comfort\r\nat sea. They were limited in length, and first came the question how\r\nmany passengers they wanted to carry. The experience of a ship like\r\nthe America--which was only 400 ft. in length--showed it was not\r\nnecessary to go to great length to have great speed. A ship of 400 ft.\r\nto 430 ft. in length, 65 ft. of beam, and with a depth of 45 ft.,\r\nwould be a ship of proper dimensions for the Atlantic trade, and he\r\nbelieved it quite possible to build a vessel of special construction\r\nof about 7,000 tons gross register which should steam with less\r\nconsumption of coal than the Umbria and Etruria at a rate of 22 knots,\r\ncrossing the Atlantic from Liverpool to New York in six days. He\r\nthought that was likely to be the vessel of the future, and that it\r\nwould be quite as commercially successful as the Umbria or Etruria.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Campbell remarked that at present the great American liners had\r\nonly the ordinary compound engines, and he thought that, instead of\r\nconverting them to triple expansion, they should take a step further\r\nat once, and adopt quadruple expansion engines. This class of engines\r\nwas being very successfully built in various parts of the country. He\r\nshould recommend the adoption of a three-crank six-cylinder engine.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton did not think it had been demonstrated that greater\r\nefficiency had been got out of twin screws than out of single screws;\r\nbut there was no doubt they would tend to additional safety.\r\n\r\nMr. Martell said that when they had got satisfactory data, twin screws\r\nwould be adopted for ships requiring great speed; but they had not got\r\nthat data at present.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sir John Hay, referring to twin screws as applying to\r\nsea-going steamers which might be employed for imperial defense, said\r\nit was quite certain that the defense of their extended commerce\r\nwould always require to be assisted by ships such as the Oregon and\r\nother magnificent vessels which had been used for that purpose on a\r\nrecent occasion. He believed that for war purposes the twin screw was\r\nrecognized by all naval men as having very many advantages. If that\r\nwere so, it was quite evident that it would be a great advantage,\r\nunder such conditions as occurred at the loss of the Oregon, if the\r\ncompartments could be made completely water-tight; and the twin screw,\r\nwith the separation of the ship longitudinally, gave them the very\r\ngreatest possible protection. They could not trust to bulkheads that\r\nwere only closed occasionally by doors. What was required for war\r\npurposes was the entire and complete isolation of different parts of\r\nthe ship, having always practically closed communications between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. John then replied on the general discussion. He was pleased to\r\nfind that they had faith in the future of the twin screw and of\r\nsubdivision. The public had a right to demand greater safety than they\r\nat present had on the Atlantic, or could have with a single screw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION QUESTIONS IN GENERAL CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the last examination paper given to\r\ncandidates who are desirous of employment in the constructive\r\ndepartments of the municipality of New York:\r\n\r\nN.B.--In case candidate does not remember formula or method of solving\r\nany problem submitted to him, let him name any work upon the subject\r\nwhere such formula or method may be found.\r\n\r\n1.

Heidelberg, usually so quiet, assumed the role of a city of\r\nthe world, and all was bustle and excitement in the streets, which\r\nwere hung with flags and other decorations. The trains constantly\r\nbrought new accessions to the crowd, and gayety and mirth reigned\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the renovated _Aula_ of the University served as a\r\nprelude to the festivities of the week. On this occasion a splendid\r\nflag, embroidered by order of the wives of the faculty of the Academy,\r\nan equally costly cover for the scepter, and a silver inkstand were\r\nadded to the treasures of the University. Conspicuous among the\r\nnumerous presents received were a richly carved set of furniture--the\r\ngift of former students from Switzerland--and all the publications of\r\ncertain book dealers.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 2, the Grand Duke and Duchess arrived in\r\nHeidelberg, where they were received with much enthusiasm. They\r\nremained at the modest palace during the time of the jubilee, and\r\nwhenever they appeared they were greeted with expressions of\r\npatriotism and love. On the evening of the 2d, the _Oberburgermeister_,\r\nDr. Wilckens, extended a hearty welcome to the guests who had gathered\r\nin the over crowded hall. Vincenz Lachner conducted the musical part of\r\nthe entertainment, which was charming. The German Crown Prince arrived\r\nearly on the 3d, so as to accompany his royal cousins to the service in\r\nthe beautifully decorated _Heiliggeistkirche_, on which occasion Prof.\r\nBassermann spoke with great effect. At 11 o'clock, the Court appeared in\r\nthe _Aula_, where the Grand Duke presided, in virtue of his office of\r\n\"Rector Magnificentissimus.\" His address was followed by those of the\r\nCrown Prince; the _Prorector Geheimrath_, Dr. Bekker; Edward Zeller, of\r\nBerlin; Jules Zeller, of Paris; and others. In the evening the citizens\r\nand strangers were attracted to the _Jettenbühel_ by the festival at the\r\ncastle; from 7:30 until 10 o'clock the nobility held court in the\r\n_Bandhause_. The scene was like fairyland, all the outlines of the\r\ncastle were marked by thousands of small lights, and the court was\r\nlighted by great candelabra. In the ever-increasing crowd it was\r\ndifficult to find a place and to obtain refreshments, which were given\r\nout in immense quantities by the State.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th the people thronged again to the\r\n_Heiliggeistkirche_ to listen to the address of the _Geheimrath_, Dr.\r\nKuno Fischer, on the fate of the Palatinate and Heidelberg, which was\r\npreceded and followed by music. After this the participants in the\r\nfestival were brought together by a dinner in the Museum Hall, and\r\nseldom have speeches so inspired an audience as did those of the Grand\r\nDuke and the Crown Prince. Never has Heidelberg seen such a\r\ntorch-light procession as that formed by the students in honor of\r\ntheir Rector; 3,000 torches lighted him to the City Hall. He thanked\r\nthem, and proposed cheers for the Crown Prince.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th there was the presentation of degrees. In\r\nthe afternoon a special train carried four hundred people to\r\nKarlsruhe, where the royal party held a great reception. The capital\r\nwas decorated with flags, the city parks were lighted with Bengal\r\nlights, there was music, and a song by the patriotic bard Vierordt was\r\nsung.\r\n\r\nAll the splendor and interest shrank into insignificance before the\r\ngrand historical procession on the morning of the 6th, which made a\r\nlasting impression on the minds of all. The throng of 100,000 people\r\nwatched quietly while the whole history of the Palatinate passed in\r\nreview before them. The procession illustrated this history much\r\nbetter than it could have been told by any professor or any book.\r\nThere was not a vacant space to be found, extra trains having brought\r\nmore spectators, and yet everything passed off quietly and without\r\naccident. In the evening there was a heavy shower, which freshened\r\neverything, leaving no ill effects to be seen the next morning, which\r\nwas more than could be said of many of those who attended the imposing\r\n_Commerse_ of the Heidelberg students. As a former student, the Grand\r\nDuke appeared among the 6,000 visitors at the _Commerse_, where he\r\npresided and spoke enthusiastically of the Emperor. Other speeches\r\nfollowed, until the conversation became so animated that even Von\r\nTreitschke, who was received with an ovation, could not be heard. At\r\nmidnight the court retired and the _Fidelitas_ succeeded to their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the time was spent in excursions and carousing until the\r\nillumination of the castle began. I never saw an illumination of the\r\nruins which could compare in beauty with that of the 7th. The night\r\nwas favorable for fireworks, until finally they were rivaled by the\r\nmoon, numerous boats trimmed with colored lanterns passed along the\r\nriver, there were fire-wheels on the bridge, water fireworks on the\r\nriver, and the quiet was disturbed alternately by the rockets and\r\nmusic, and when the names of the Grand Duke and Duchess, crowned with\r\nbrilliant fire, appeared over the water, there was an involuntary\r\noutburst of enthusiasm. If the old Elector and Electoress could have\r\nbeen present at the closing entertainment of the jubilee, on the\r\nevening of the 8th, they would have rejoiced to see the new life\r\nbrought to the ruins by their successor.--_Illustrirte Zeitung._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF LEATHER IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this extensive paper it appears that the matters chiefly used in\r\ntanning are the bark of the oak, containing from 6.04 to 4.37 per\r\ncent. of tannin according to the season, that of willows, of the elm,\r\nand the birch. The leaves of the arbutus, employed in the governments\r\nof Kasan, Viatka, and Perm, contain about 16 per cent. of tannin,\r\nwhile the root of wild sorrel (_Rumex acetosella_) contains 12 per\r\ncent. For removing the hair from hides, a lye made from wood ashes is\r\nstill employed. The softening of the leather is effected by means of\r\nthe excrement of dogs, which acts on the leather by means of the\r\nbiliary acid present, which forms with soda a kind of soap. After\r\ntanning, white Russia leather is coated with a mixture of tar and seal\r\noil. Black Russia leather is dyed with alum, extract of sanders, and\r\nferrous sulphate. Horse hides are tanned to a great extent for sole\r\nleather.--_M.

It will suffice to recall the fact that\r\nafter the accident a private committee was formed for the purpose of\r\nmaking an attempt to save the five victims who had been surprised in\r\nthe drifts, and who happened to be in the bottom levels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPLORING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe Lippmann establishment at once offered to make a boring by means\r\nof which it would be possible to communicate with the galleries in\r\nwhich the men were imprisoned, but, despite the most active efforts,\r\nsuccess was found impossible. In order to satisfy public opinion, the\r\ncommittee resolved to bore a well 12 inches in diameter to a depth of\r\n23 feet, that should permit of reaching the gallery; but this did not\r\nrender the latter accessible. How was it to be seen what had occurred,\r\nhow was it to be made certain that the men were dead, and that all\r\nhope of rescue must be abandoned? To Mr. Langlois, a Parisian\r\nphotographer, was confided an order to construct a special apparatus\r\nwhich might be let down to the bottom of the well by a cord, and\r\nwhich, being capable of operating from a distance, should furnish the\r\nrequired information through sensitized plates. As may be seen, this\r\noperation presented peculiar difficulties, although Mr. Langlois was\r\nenabled to overcome these with much skill.\r\n\r\nThe photographic apparatus that the ingenious operator constructed was\r\ncontained in a metallic case that could be let down into the bore\r\nhole. The upper and lower parts of the contrivance were provided with\r\nincandescent lamps, that could be lighted or extinguished from a\r\ndistance, by means of conductors. The photographic apparatus, properly\r\nso called, formed of an objective and camera with its sensitized\r\nplate, was inclosed in a cylinder 3½ inches in diameter. By means of a\r\ncord drawn at the mouth of the well, the apparatus could be made to\r\nissue from its vertical sheath, and to pivot around its axis so as\r\ntake views in different directions (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe entire affair was suspended by twelve-foot iron rods, connected\r\nwith each other end for end.\r\n\r\nIn using the apparatus, the operating was done in a shanty, which\r\nserved as a dark room. The device was let down into the bore well\r\nuntil it touched bottom. At this moment a cord was pulled so as to\r\nraise the camera, and then a few moments were allowed to elapse in\r\norder that the apparatus might become immovable. As the objective was\r\nall the time in the dark, it had neither cap nor shutter, but was\r\nunmasked from the beginning of the operation.\r\n\r\nIn order to form an impression on the plate, it was only necessary to\r\ngive light; this being easily done by passing an electric current by\r\nmeans of a commutator, so as to light the incandescent lamps. At the\r\nend of the exposure, the lamps were extinguished and the entire\r\napparatus was immersed in darkness. The mean time of exposure was from\r\nfour to five minutes. The apparatus was then hauled up, and the\r\nnegative developed.\r\n\r\nThe experiments could be renewed as often as necessary, and the\r\napparatus be pointed in all directions by turning it a certain number\r\nof degrees by means of a lever attached to the upper rod. In this way\r\nwere obtained various views of the inaccessible gallery in different\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 2 AND 3.--REPRODUCTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN\r\nTHE INACCESSIBLE GALLERIES.]\r\n\r\nWe reproduce herewith two of Mr. Langlois' most interesting\r\nphotographs. One of these shows the head of the corpse of a young\r\nminer whose face stands out in relief against the side of the gallery\r\n(Fig. 2) the other shows a wheel and a lot of debris heaped up\r\npell-mell (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThe series of proofs obtained from small negatives, two inches square,\r\ngave the completest sort of information in regard to the aspect of the\r\nsubterranean gallery.\r\n\r\nThe exact place where the boring had been done and the entire and\r\nbroken pillars were recognized, as was also the presence of two\r\ncorpses, thus showing that it was indeed here that it would have been\r\nnecessary to act in order to render aid to the unfortunates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--FAULT THAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4 is shown the appearance of the great fault that caused the\r\naccident at Chancelade. It seems to us that this method of\r\nphotographing inaccessible subterranean galleries ought to receive\r\nnumerous applications in the future.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMZEE'S NEW GAS-BURNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the object of effecting a very intimate mixture of gas and air,\r\nand of causing this mixture to reach the point of ignition at as high\r\na temperature as possible, M. Leon Somzee, of Brussels, has designed\r\nseveral new forms of gas burner, which we now proceed to describe and\r\nillustrate, from particulars and by drawings kindly supplied by an\r\nesteemed Brussels correspondent.\r\n\r\nThe high-power burner shown in Fig. 1 effects perfect combustion of\r\nthe heated mixture of air and gas, which is introduced by the draught\r\ndetermined by the arrangement. What chiefly distinguishes this burner\r\nfrom others of its class is the fact that it is perfectly suited to\r\ndomestic lighting--that is to say, it may be arranged for a\r\ncomparatively small consumption of gas, while giving an increase of\r\n250 per cent. of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. and FIG. 2. INCANDESCENT AND HIGH-POWER\r\nBURNERS.]\r\n\r\nThe burner proper is a cage or basket of specially prepared magnesia,\r\nwhich yields a warmer tone of light than any obtained hitherto, while\r\nnot requiring so high a temperature before combustion. The cap, made\r\nof a fire-resisting substance, fits on to a tubular arrangement, R,\r\nfixed in the upper portion of the body of the burner. The latter is\r\nsupplied by air entering at the cone, O, which terminates the inner\r\nchamber, K, of the heater, and also by that drawn in by the rising\r\ncolumn of gas, passing before the orifices, D, which may be regulated\r\nat will. The small burner, I, which is kept constantly alight, heats\r\nthe central compartment, K, the sides of which transmit heat to the\r\ngas circulating in the annular casing, L, of the compartment. The\r\nheated gas passes, by the passage, AA¹, into the space, C, where it\r\nbecomes intimately mixed with the air entering at OP, and also with\r\nthe outer air arriving by the lateral apertures, D.\r\n\r\nThe _vis viva_ of the jet is diffused through this mixture, which thus\r\nbecomes very intimate, when it penetrates into the tubular\r\narrangement, R; combustion now taking place at the top, while the\r\nrefractory cap emits a bright orange light of great steadiness. As it\r\nis not the flow of gas which determines the entrance of the outer air,\r\nthe former may be used at any pressure--an advantageous arrangement in\r\nall respects.\r\n\r\nWhen the small burner, I, in the lower chamber is lighted, the\r\nproducts of combustion issue by the orifice, O, of the compartment,\r\nterminating in a needle like that of the steam injector; and the jet\r\ndraws along the air entering the apertures, PP, above the cone. The\r\ngas from the pipe, arriving from the annular space, L, fills the two\r\nlateral pockets shown in dotted lines, and passes through the\r\norifices, AA¹, which communicate with the upper chamber of the\r\nburner. The manner in which it is conveyed thence to the tubular\r\narrangement has already been described.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows a more simple method of carrying out the same principle,\r\nand of effecting a considerable saving in gas for a given intensity of\r\nlight. In this form, a wick, T, impregnated with an alkaline earthy\r\nsolution, a few seconds after lighting, affords a focus of white light\r\nremarkable for its steadiness and brilliancy. A draught of air is\r\ncreated by a jet of gas issuing from the hollow needle, B, and passing\r\nthrough the vessel, D, which is provided with orifices, O, for the\r\nentrance of air. The air and gas pass from D into C, whence (after\r\ntheir intimate mixture is effected) they pass into the tubular\r\narrangement, F, at the top of which combustion takes place.\r\n\r\nTo regulate the proportions in which the air and gas should mingle, in\r\norder that the combination should be as intimate as possible, the air\r\ninlet is made variable by a perforated collar, which permits of the\r\norifices, O, being more or less covered. The other proportions of the\r\nburner--that is to say, the relative capacity of the two compartments\r\nand the length of the hollow needle--are determined by the sectional\r\narea of the supply-pipe for the gas, which is admitted under moderate\r\npressure. Instead of a wire-gauze cap, impregnated with a solution of\r\nmetals or of salts, two fine platinum wires may be used--one bent into\r\nthe form of a semicircle of about an inch radius, and the other (of\r\nslightly larger diameter) rolled spirally round the former. When both\r\nends of the two wires are connected with the upper portion of the\r\ntubular arrangement (which in this case is flattened), and the gas is\r\nignited at the burner, the metallic arc becomes red hot, and then\r\nbrightly incandescent, emitting a light, less brilliant indeed than\r\nwith magnesia, but of remarkable steadiness.\r\n\r\nIn this case the production of light is chiefly due to the fact that\r\ncalorific condensation, caused by the use of the helicoidal coil\r\nsurrounding the curved wire, prevents loss of heat in this conductor.\r\nIn these forms of high-power burner, in which the gas is used directly\r\nfor the production of light, the difficulty generally encountered of\r\nheating the air (present in a larger volume than the gas) has been\r\nsuccessfully overcome.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the straight and outspread flame burner with a special\r\nheater. In this arrangement the gas and air are heated before\r\ncombustion, in the compartment, G, directly exposed to the action of a\r\nsmall Bunsen burner, R, which is placed (in an opaque glass) in the\r\nmiddle of a lyre-shaped figure formed by the two gas-pipes, AA. The\r\nburner proper consists of two fine annular passages meeting above, and\r\nemitting a thin annular sheet of gas over the guide, T, made of a\r\nwhite refractory substance placed between the two annular jets. The\r\nobject of this guide is to stretch the incandescent sheet of flame,\r\ncomposed of several jets, and interpose friction, so as to prevent a\r\ntoo rapid ascent of hot gases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 REGENERATIVE BURNERS WITH INVERTED\r\nFLAMES.]\r\n\r\nThe luminous focus is placed within a glass globe, C, mounted on the\r\nbell, B, of the heater; and the external air enters this bell,\r\nmingling with the products of combustion of the heating burner, R. The\r\nportion, D, of the annular passage, B, being made of a highly\r\nconductive metal, the gas becomes heated in passing to the burner, so\r\nthat both gas and air are raised to the same temperature by the time\r\nthey reach the orifices of the burner. Instead of prolonging the\r\ngas-pipe to the point of bifurcation, a chamber may be arranged\r\nimmediately below the guide, for the gas and air to become intimately\r\nmixed by passing through several perforations or wire gauze, receiving\r\nthe excess of heat from the white porcelain guide. The admission of\r\ngas to both the main and heating burners is regulated by a double\r\nvalve in the pipe; but this arrangement may be used without any\r\nprevious heating of the gas and air.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows a similar arrangement to that above described, but\r\nreversed; the gas and air being previously heated by the products of\r\ncombustion. The two pipes, D, lead the gas to the burner; and the\r\nincandescent sheet of flame is drawn over a white refractory\r\nsubstance, having in its center an orifice through which the hot gases\r\nrise to the upper portion of the burner. The luminous sheet is spread\r\nout all the better on account of this return of the flames, which also\r\ncauses the mixture of air and gas to be more complete than when they\r\nrise directly. The gas escapes horizontally from the orifices of the\r\nannular burner, B, and mingles with the double current of hot air\r\nwhich rushes in above the flame inside the globe, and also below\r\nthrough the central portion of the burner.\r\n\r\nThis lamp throws its light vertically downward; and its illuminating\r\npower may be increased by providing, above the incandescent sheet, a\r\nreflector, which diverts into a useful direction the rays thrown\r\ntoward the ceiling. In this arrangement of lamp the flame is\r\nexcessively condensed by its being turned back over the refractory\r\nguide; and this condensation greatly favors the production of light.\r\nOn the other hand, the combustion of the gas is very perfect, because\r\nthe currents of hot air are thrown directly upon the two sides of the\r\nflame; and thus the reciprocal action becomes more intense. Lastly,\r\nthe division of the gas into a large number of small jets, in contact\r\nwith which the hot air forms an intimate mixture, causes a greater\r\nquantity of molecules to partake in the combinations; thus affording a\r\nproportionate increase of temperature in a given space and time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. REGENERATIVE BURNER WITH FLAME DEFLECTED\r\nOUTWARD.]\r\n\r\nOwing to these various circumstances, the final effective duty of this\r\nburner is advantageous, so that it yields an illuminating power which\r\nmay be put at from 200 to 250 per cent. above that of ordinary\r\nburners, and about 25 per cent. more than that of other regenerative\r\nburners. The flame is comparatively steady; the loss due to the\r\nfriction over the white porcelain being almost eliminated, because the\r\nflame only presses upon the guide for a small portion of its surface,\r\nand is only spread out to the extent of its dark zone.\r\n\r\nThe contact between the incandescent sheet of flame and the guide may\r\nbe made as short as desired, and the motion of the gaseous mass be\r\ndirected by a simple button placed in the center of the burner; thus\r\ngiving the form shown by Fig. 5, which, however, differs from the\r\nprevious figure in the fact that the inverted flame is directed\r\noutward instead of inward.\r\n\r\nIn this arrangement the button, T, is fixed in the middle of the\r\nburner, which is made cylindrical and annular, or may consist of a\r\nring of small tubes, to which the gas is led by a single pipe; leaving\r\nthe whole \"furnace\" free for the circulation of air and the products\r\nof combustion. This is the most recent development of the principle\r\npatented by M. Somzee in 1882, viz., the formation of an illuminating\r\nsheet of flame, spread out laterally, while heating the gas and air by\r\nthe products of combustion.\r\n\r\nFigs. 6 and 7 show two forms of burner designed especially to give\r\neconomical results with a small consumption of gas. The former is an\r\nordinary Argand burner in which hot air is introduced into the upper\r\nportion of the flame, so as to increase the activity of combustion.\r\nThe luminous sheet of flame is then spread out by a metal disk\r\nattached to the end of the tube, D, which introduces the air into the\r\nflame. The outer air becomes heated in its passage through the wire\r\ngauze, T, which absorbs the heat liberated in the interior of the\r\napparatus, and also that which is radiated from the incandescent sheet\r\nand reflected by a metal shield, P, surrounding the dark part of the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. FIG. 7. TYPES OF ECONOMICAL BURNERS.]\r\n\r\nIt is the combustion of gas, without the production of useful luminous\r\neffect inside the shield, which supplies the reflected as well as\r\nradiated heat to the air. The temperature is still further increased\r\nby the heat transmitted to the metal portion of the burner, and\r\nabsorbed by the wire gauze, between the close meshes of which the air\r\nfrom outside is forced to circulate. Air is admitted inside the flame\r\nby the chimney, D, placed above the focus, and in which it is raised\r\nto a high temperature by friction on the upper part of the lamp glass,\r\nat E, and afterward by its passage through the horizontal portion of\r\nthe bent tube. This tube is impinged upon on the outside by the\r\nflames, and also by the products of combustion, so that it forms a\r\nveritable heater of the currents which traverse it.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of hot air into the central portion of the sheet of\r\nflame is advantageously supplemented by the spreading out of the flame\r\nby means of the metal disk, without any possibility of its being\r\ndivided. In this way a more intense heat is obtained, and consequently\r\nthe illuminating power is considerably increased, by the uncombined\r\ncarbon being more readily set free, and being thus kept longer in the\r\nflame, F. This burner, which may be constructed for a moderate gas\r\nconsumption, gives remarkable results as regards illuminating power\r\nand steadiness; the abstraction of heat in no way impairing the\r\nluminosity of the flame, which preserves all its brightness.\r\n\r\nThe Argand burner with double chimney, shown in Fig. 7, is also an\r\neconomical one for a small consumption of gas. The air admitted to\r\nboth the inside and the outside is raised to a high temperature by\r\npassing along the spirals of a second and transparent chimney, C¹,\r\nwhich surrounds the cylindrical glass, C. The gas itself is heated by\r\npassing through this hot chamber before reaching the outlet orifices;\r\nso that the mixture of air and gas takes place under the most\r\nfavorable conditions for their perfect combustion.\r\n\r\nThe burner is an ordinary Argand, which may terminate below in a small\r\nchamber for the gas and air to mingle. But this is not necessary; and\r\nthe usual arrangement for mixing the air and gas may be adopted. The\r\nouter air enters at the top of the central chimney, C and passes into\r\nthe annular space between the two glasses; then descends by the two\r\nspiral passages, which surround the cylindrical glass and terminate\r\nin a portion hermetically sealed by a brass plate attached to the\r\nsupply-pipe. All the parts of the burner are thus surrounded by a\r\nhighly-heated atmosphere, especially at the bottom of the double\r\nchimney; and it will be readily understood that, if the branches which\r\nlead the gas to the burner are constructed of a highly conductive\r\nmetal, the gas will become heated in its turn by passing through\r\npassages raised to a high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe elements are therefore dissociated or separated before their final\r\ncombination; thereby raising the calorific and luminous effect to the\r\nhighest possible degree. Such a burner can, of course, be made as\r\nsmall as may be required; thus lending itself admirably to the\r\nsubdivision of illumination. The only precaution required is to\r\nproperly proportion the sectional area of the hot-air passages to the\r\nradiant surface of the flame, so that the heat does not become too\r\nintense at the lower portion of the burner.\r\n\r\nFig. 8 shows a double flame burner on the principle of Mr. Heron's,\r\nbut with admission of hot air into the angle formed by the flames. As\r\nexemplified by Mr. Heron, if two equal batswing burners separately\r\ngive a certain amount of light, on the two flames being brought into\r\ncontact, so as to form a single flame, the luminosity is considerably\r\nincreased, owing to the condensation of heat which results from their\r\nmeeting. The two incandescent sheets are, as it were, forced into one\r\nanother, so as to be combined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. DOUBLE FLAT-FLAME BURNER]\r\n\r\nThe high-power burners of Douglass, Coze, Mallet, and others were\r\ndesigned on this principle; but its application to uninclosed burners\r\nwas not very satisfactory, because the great cooling down of the inner\r\nsurface of the flames by the strong draught of cold air impaired their\r\nilluminating power. To counteract this difficulty, M. Somzee adopts a\r\nheating burner, A, which he places between the two batswing burners,\r\nB, so that the products of combustion rise in the angle made by the\r\ntwo lighting flames, as shown; thus greatly increasing their\r\nluminosity while maintaining a low consumption of gas.\r\n\r\nM. Somzee also raises the illuminating power of an ordinary flat-flame\r\nburner by causing an obscure effluvium to traverse the dark portion of\r\nthe flame. The effect of this is to increase the activity of\r\ndecomposition in this portion, so that the particles of carbon are the\r\nmore readily set free, and remain longer in suspension in the luminous\r\nzone. The obscure effluvium may be determined between two points by\r\nthe electric current, or be caused by the heating of an imperfect\r\nconductor by the current; or, again, it may result from a metal\r\nconductor heated by the reactions produced in the middle of the flame,\r\nby separating the cone of matter in ignition. The effect may be\r\ncompared with that obtained by the concentration of two sheets of\r\nflame; but in this case the sheets are formed by the constituent parts\r\nof one and the same flame, whence results a more complete utilization\r\nof the elements composing it. This system is, in fact, a\r\nsimplification of the arrangement adopted in the double-flame burner\r\nseen in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 shows a reflecting and regenerative burner with double glass.\r\nThe crown, made of metal polished on both sides, has a circular\r\ngroove, G, for receiving the end of the central chimney, C, and\r\npresenting an annular aperture by which the products of combustion\r\nenter. The second glass, C¹, is fastened to the collar of the\r\nburner carrier, and does not come into contact with the metal crown;\r\nso as to allow the air to enter from outside for supplying the burner.\r\nThe gas enters by the pipe, T, provided with a cock. This pipe is\r\ncontinued to the top of the apparatus, and there spreads out into the\r\nform of a dome; thus dividing into two compartments the trunconic\r\nchamber, S¹ S², whence the hot gas returns to the body of the burner,\r\nB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 9. REFLECTING AND REGENERATING BURNER.]\r\n\r\nOn the burner being lighted from below, the products of combustion\r\nrise in the inner chimney, and enter the heater, which they traverse\r\nthrough its entire extent, while impinging against the outside of the\r\ngas reservoir, to which they give up a large portion of their heat.\r\nThey then pass by the passage, D, into the atmosphere or into a\r\nchimney. The air necessary for combustion enters at the top of the\r\nouter globe, and becomes highly heated in its passage through the\r\nspace comprised between the two glasses of the burner. In this way it\r\nreaches the burner, and forms an intimate mixture with the small jets\r\nof gas which compose the flame. The gas, on leaving the supply-pipe,\r\nT, fills one of the compartments, S¹ S², of the heater, and then\r\nreturns by the second compartment, and again descends by the casing of\r\nthe supply-pipe, having its temperature still further raised by\r\ncontact with the internal radiation of the flame.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, all the parts of the burner are supplied by\r\nheated air, and the combustion becomes very active; thus increasing\r\nthe intensity of the flame, and consequently that of the light\r\nafforded, while at the same time effecting a saving of 50 per cent. of\r\ngas. This burner may be made of any size, and for consumptions not\r\nexceeding that of an ordinary Argand. In fact, the gas is consumed at\r\na low pressure, escaping with no greater force than that due to the\r\nheat of the products of combustion. It is sufficiently expanded on\r\ncoming into contact with the current of hot air, the activity of which\r\nis regulated by the height of the apparatus, that is to say, by that\r\nof its two chimneys. The mixture is made in such proportion as to\r\nobtain from the gas and air as great a degree of luminosity as\r\npossible. The high temperature of the gas, and the independent means\r\nof heating the air and gas, constitute the essential principles of\r\nthis burner.--_Journal of Gas Lighting._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLAMOND GAS BURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLAMOND GAS BURNER.]\r\n\r\nIn this burner, which is a French invention, the light is produced by\r\nburning ordinary coal gas within a basket of magnesia, which is\r\nthereby brought to a high state of incandescence, and from which a\r\nwhite, steady light is radiated. It may be said to consist of three\r\ndifferent parts. The first and inner part is a central column, B, of\r\nfireproof material. The second part consists of two concentric\r\ncylinders placed round the inner column and communicating one with the\r\nother through the cross cuts, J. The third part is a china cup\r\ninclosing the other parts, and perforated with a number of holes. The\r\ngas burns in two different places. From A it passes directly through\r\nB, at the top of which it branches off through tubes to an annular\r\nchamber, D, from which it escapes through the openings, _a_, _a_, _a_,\r\nwhere combustion takes place. The other combustion occurs within the\r\ncircular space, G, I, between the column and the inner of the two\r\nsurrounding cylinders, through two channels, E E, in the lower part of\r\nthe central column. The gas passes into a circular chamber, F F, and\r\nescapes through small holes in the upper partition of this chamber,\r\nwhere it burns. The product of this combustion passes put into K,\r\nthrough the cross cuts, J. The air entering through the holes, H L, of\r\nthe outer china cup passes along the inner of the two concentric\r\ncylinders, which is heated to redness, and rises highly heated toward\r\nthe upper annular burner, where the gas burns at _a_, _a_, _a_, in small\r\nseparate flames, each entirely surrounded by the hot air. This insures\r\nperfect combustion of the gas within the basket of magnesia placed\r\nabove, and which is thus brought to a state of incandescence. It will\r\nbe seen from this description how simple and practical the\r\narrangement is. It is claimed for the light produced that it will\r\nstand comparison with the electric light. Like that, it shows colors\r\nperfectly true, and will enable an observer to distinguish between the\r\nmost delicate shades, allowing of the finest work being executed as by\r\ndaylight. It is, moreover, stated to be perfectly steady. As the\r\nClamond burner can be fixed to any gas bracket or lamp now in use, its\r\nadoption causes no other expense than the cost of the burner itself.\r\nThere is no expensive installation, and when used in combination with\r\nthe electric light, it is claimed that a uniform lighting will be\r\nobtainable instead of the unpleasant contrast between gas and\r\nelectricity. Another important advantage obtained by the Clamond\r\nburner is the saving effected in the consumption of gas as compared\r\nwith the same power of light obtained from ordinary burners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW THERMO-REGULATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the thermo-regulators which have been constructed heretofore, the\r\nheat has been regulated by the variation in the inflow of gas to the\r\nheating flame. The apparatus described below, and shown in the\r\naccompanying cut, taken from the _Zeitschrift fur Instrumentenkunde_,\r\noperates on an entirely different principle. The distillation and\r\ncondensation process of a fluid heated to the boiling point in the\r\nvessel, A, is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe steam passes first through the pipes, _a_ and _c_, into the\r\nserpentine tube, where it is condensed, and then flows through the\r\ntubes, _d_ and _b_, back into the vessel, A, if the cock, _r_, is\r\nclosed, but if the said cock is open, it flows into the receptacle, K.\r\nWhen the liquid begins to boil the steam passes freely through the\r\ntubes, _d_ and _b_, part passing through the tube, _f_, out into the\r\nair, and the other part passing through the open cock, _r_, to the\r\nreceptacle, K; but the condensed liquid soon closes these passages to\r\nthe steam. At _h_ is an opening for a thermometer, _t_, and through\r\nthis opening the liquid can be poured into the vessel, A. If the cock,\r\n_r_, is kept closed, the volume of liquid in the vessel, A, cannot be\r\ndiminished, and the bath, B, must take the constant and uniform\r\ntemperature of the steam in the vessel, A, as the vessel, B, is heated\r\nevenly on all sides.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus can also be used as an air bath, in which case the\r\nvessel, B, is left empty and closed by a suitable stopper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPETTE FOR TAKING THE DENSITY OF LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving represents a simple apparatus, which any\r\nperson accustomed to working glass can make for himself, and which\r\npermits of quickly, and with close approximation, estimating the\r\ndensity of a liquid. In addition, it has the advantage of requiring\r\nbut a very small quantity of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIt consists simply of a straight pipette, A B, to which is affixed\r\nlaterally, at the upper part, a small U-shaped water gauge.\r\n\r\nThe two branches of the gauge, as well as the pipette itself, are\r\ngraduated into equal divisions. If need be, the graduating may be done\r\nby simply pasting on the glass strips of paper, upon which a graduated\r\nscale has been drawn. The zero of the pipette's graduation is exactly\r\nat the lower extremity, B. The graduation of the two gauge tubes\r\nextends in both directions from a zero situated near the center. The\r\nzeros of the two branches must correspond as exactly as possible, so\r\nthat they shall be in the same horizontal plane when the apparatus is\r\nfixed upon a support. To render the apparatus complete, it only\r\nremains to adapt, at A, a rubber tube provided with a wire clamp, and\r\nterminating in a short glass tube for sucking through with the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIPETTE FOR TAKING THE DENSITY OF LIQUIDS.]\r\n\r\nFor taking the density of a liquid, we plunge the end, B, into it, and\r\nthen suck, and afterward close the rubber tube with the clamp. It is\r\nessential that this latter shall hold well, so that the levels may\r\nremain constant.\r\n\r\nWe now do the reading. Suppose, for example, we read 250.3 mm. on the\r\npipette, and 147.7 mm. and 152 mm. on the branches of the gauge.\r\nHaving these data, we loosen the clamp, and allow the liquid to flow.\r\nOn account of capillarity, there remains a drop in B; and of this we\r\nread the height, say 6 mm. A height 250.5 mm - 6 = 244.5 mm. of liquid\r\nraised is, then, balanced by a column of water of 147.5 + 152 = 299\r\nmm.\r\n\r\nNow the heights of these two liquids is in the inverse ratio of their\r\ndensities:\r\n\r\n  _d_   299.5\r\n  --- = -----, whence _d_ = 1.22.\r\n   1    244.5\r\n\r\nWe obtain _d_ by a simple division.\r\n\r\nWhen the instrument has been carefully graduated, and has been\r\nconstructed by an expert, the accuracy of the first two decimals may\r\nbe relied upon. With a little practice in estimating the last drop, we\r\nmay, in trying to estimate the density of water, even reach a closer\r\napproximation. In order to measure the height of the drop accurately,\r\none should read the maximum height to which the liquid rises between\r\nthe fall of two drops at the moment when the last ones are falling,\r\nsince at that moment, and only at that, can it be ascertained that the\r\nlower level of the bubble is plane. The error in such reading does not\r\nreach half a millimeter, and, as a suitable height of the apparatus\r\npermits of having columns that vary between 13 and 30 centimeters, an\r\nerror of this kind is but 1-300. This is the limit of precision of the\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe clamp might be advantageously replaced by a glass cock, or, better\r\nstill, A might terminate in a rubber bulb; and a lateral tubulure\r\nmight be fixed to the pipette, and be closed with a rubber stopper.\r\n\r\nThis little apparatus is more easily maneuvered than any of those that\r\nhave hitherto been devised upon the same principle. It is capable also\r\nof replacing areometers in ordinary determinations, since it permits\r\nof correcting the error in capillarity that is neglected in\r\ninstruments; and, moreover, one can, when he desires to, easily verify\r\nfor himself the accuracy of the graduation.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL BAGS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN T. HUMPHREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the papers on \"Boot and Shoemaking,\" in vol. i. of _Amateur\r\nWork_, illustrated, I think nothing relating to the leather trades has\r\nappeared in it; and as there must be many among the readers of this\r\nmagazine who have a desire to dive deeper into the art of manipulating\r\nleather into the various articles of utility made from that material,\r\nI will endeavor in the series of articles of which this is the\r\ncommencement to furnish them with the necessary instructions which\r\nwill enable them to do for themselves many things which now are left\r\nundone, or else have to be conveyed miles to some town where the\r\nparticular business, or something akin to it, is carried on. To the\r\ncolonist and those who live in out-of-the-way districts, it must be a\r\nmatter of great regret to observe articles of use, where the material\r\nis in good condition, rapidly becoming useless owing to the inability\r\nof the possessor to do the necessary repairs. Again, it may be that\r\nthe article is completely worn out, and the old proverb that \"a stitch\r\nin time saves nine,\" will not be advantageously applied if carried\r\nout. In that case a knowledge of making new what we require, whether\r\nin order to replace something already worn out or as an addition to\r\nour store, must prove beneficial to the thrifty amateur. My object in\r\nwriting these articles is not to deprive the mechanic of any portion\r\nof his legitimate occupation, but to assist those who live at a\r\ndistance too great to be able to employ him, and who necessarily\r\nprefer any makeshift to the inconvenience of sending miles, and being\r\nwithout for days, an article which might possibly be set right in an\r\nhour or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE BAGS.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned carpet bag (Fig. 1) is still unsurpassed by any,\r\nwhere rough wear is the principal thing to be studied. Such a bag, if\r\nconstructed of good Brussels carpeting and unquestionable workmanship,\r\nwill last a lifetime, provided always that a substantial frame is\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1.--THE CARPET BAG.]\r\n\r\nNext in order comes the brief bag (Fig. 2), more extensively used than\r\nany other. For business purposes it is in great favor with bag users,\r\nbeing made in a variety of shapes, but all belonging to the same\r\nclass. Here we have the shallow brief, deep brief, eclipse wide mouth,\r\nimperial wide mouth, excelsior, courier, and many others; but to know\r\nhow to make one will be sufficient for all, the only difference being\r\nin the cut or style in which they are constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE BRIEF BAG.]\r\n\r\nThe cricket bat bag (represented in Fig. 3) is made on the same\r\nprinciple throughout as the carpet bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE CRICKET BAT BAG.]\r\n\r\nFrames and all necessary fittings required in making bags may be\r\npurchased of dealers.\r\n\r\nCare must be observed in choosing all the pieces necessary for a bag\r\nfrom the same pattern carpet, otherwise it will present an unsightly\r\nappearance when completed. There may be some who would prefer American\r\ncloth; this is thoroughly waterproof, and has a good appearance for\r\nsome time, but, like all articles of imitation, it has only\r\n_cheapness_ to recommend it. If cloth is to be used (I mean American\r\ncloth), let it be the best that can be bought, that which is called\r\n\"double-twill duck,\" if possible. As the making is the same whether\r\ncloth or carpet be used, it will be understood that the instructions\r\nfor making apply to both.\r\n\r\nThe following tools, which are few and inexpensive, will be required:\r\nA pair of clams (Fig. 4), cost 1s. 6d.; knife (Fig. 5), 6d.; half\r\ndozen awl blades, ½d. each; three or four boxwood handles, 1½d. each;\r\n3 foot rule, 1s.; hammer, 1s.; a packet of harness needles, size 4,\r\ncost 2½d. (these have blunt points); a bone (Fig. 6) will also be\r\nrequired for rubbing the stiffening into place, cost about 3d.; and a\r\nball each of hemp and wax for making the sewing threads--hemp 2½d.,\r\nwax ½d. For making holes in the bottom where the nails or studs are\r\nfixed, a large sewing-awl will be required; this will probably have to\r\nbe bought at a saddler's; the other tools can all be obtained at any\r\ngrindery and leather seller's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--Pair of Clams. FIG. 5--Knife. FIG. 6--Bone\r\nRubber. FIG. 7--Method of Measuring Registered Frame: A to A, Top of\r\nSides; A to B, Top of Gussets. FIG. 8--Pattern of Bottom, Showing\r\nPlace of Nails. FIG. 9--Side Pattern Folded. FIG. 10--Gusset Pattern\r\nFolded. FIG. 11--Pattern for Gusset Stiffening. FIG. 12--Handle,\r\nShowing Distance of Rings.]\r\n\r\nThe awl blades mentioned above are of two kinds, and either may be\r\nused for this work. Those generally used are of a straight diagonal\r\nshape, making a perforation the shape of a diamond, <>*; the others are\r\nperfectly round, tapering gradually to a fine point. To fix them in\r\nthe boxwood handles, place the blade in a vise, leaving the unpolished\r\npart above the jaws; hold the handle above this, and commence driving\r\nit down, taking care that the blade is penetrating the middle of the\r\nhandle. Continue tapping the handle until the ferrule reaches the\r\npolished part of the blade; it will then be in far enough.\r\n\r\n  * Transcriber's Note: Original diamond vertical instead of horizontal.\r\n\r\nA good serviceable pair of clams may be made by taking two staves of a\r\ngood-sized barrel, and cutting about 10 inches off the end of each.\r\nScrew together with three screws (as in Fig. 4), and shape the\r\nuppermost ends so that the outsides meet in a sharp ridge along the\r\ntop; this will give a flat surface within the mouth, by which a hold\r\nof the work may be obtained. A two-inch screw will be long enough for\r\nthe bottom, which must be turned in as tightly as possible; the others\r\nmust not be less than 3 inches, as there will be a space of 1½ or two\r\ninches between the staves at the part where they are inserted. Screw\r\nthese just tight enough to give a good sharp spring to the mouth of\r\nthe clams when they are pressed open; this will insure the work being\r\nheld firmly while being sewn. Sandpaper them over to give a smooth\r\nappearance, and these will be found as useful as bought ones.\r\n\r\nA piece of basil leather will be required for the bottom and welts of\r\nthe bag. This may be purchased at a leather seller's with the tools.\r\nCut out the bottom first; the welts may be cut from any narrow pieces.\r\nThese must be cut seven-eighths of an inch wide, then folded over, and\r\nlightly hammered down. This brings the two edges together, and when\r\nplaced in position, they should lie evenly between the edges of the\r\nmaterial. A piece of string may be laid in the welt to give it a\r\nfuller appearance if the leather is very thin.\r\n\r\nThe following dimensions of bags when made up will enable the maker to\r\nchoose the most useful size:\r\n\r\n  No. 1, 16 by 14 inches; No. 2, 19 by 16 inches;\r\n  No. 3, 21 by 17 inches; No. 4, 24 by 18 inches.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of frames and parts when cut will be as follows:\r\n\r\n          Frame.      Sides.     Bottom.    Gussets.\r\n\r\n  No. 1, 15 inches  16½ by 15½  16½ by 5½  15½ by 5½\r\n  No. 2, 18 inches  19½ by 17½  19½ by 6   17  by 6\r\n  No. 3, 20 inches  21½ by 18½  21½ by 6½  18½ by 6½\r\n  No. 4, 23 inches  24½ by 19½  24½ by 6½  19½ by 6½\r\n\r\nTaking No. 1, 16½ inches will be the length of sides and 15½ inches\r\nthe depth. The gussets are also 15½ deep, the width being 5½, the same\r\nas the bottom. Take 1½ inches from the depth of these to allow for\r\ncovering the frame, and ½ inch from the length to allow for the seams,\r\nand we have a bag 16 inches long by 14 inches deep.\r\n\r\nAnd now to commence. Arrange the pieces of carpet on the board, and\r\nmark off the size of each part required with a piece of chalk or\r\npipeclay. By cutting with the carpet, laying the right side up, we\r\nshall be able to see that the pattern of it will be in the same\r\ndirection on both sides of the bag when made up. We next take the ball\r\nof hemp, and by pushing the finger through the hole in the center of\r\nit, drive out the end. To use the hemp from the inside is much the\r\nbest way, because the ball will stand perfectly still, whereas, if\r\nstarted from the outside, it will be darting in all directions about\r\nthe floor of the workroom, and entwining itself around any obstacle\r\nwhich lies there, unless it is placed securely in a box and drawn out\r\nthrough a hole in the center of lid.\r\n\r\nA hook must be fixed in some convenient place to make the waxends on,\r\nor, as they are called in the trade, \"threads,\" which term it will be\r\nas well to call them by here; thus a _four-cord thread_ means a thread\r\nor waxend containing four strands of hemp, a six-cord contains six\r\nstrands, and so on. One of the greatest difficulties for the amateur\r\nis to produce a well-formed thread. He generally finds it thicker a\r\nfew inches from the point than at any other part. These are known in\r\nthe trade as bull-necked threads; and as the mechanic finds it\r\ndifficult to use them when his employer starts a new apprentice and\r\ngives him this job for the men, I must impress on the worker here the\r\nnecessity of making them as perfect as possible. It would be as well\r\nif a little practice was given at breaking the hemp in the way which\r\nproduces good points. Better waste a few yards of hemp than be\r\ncompelled to abandon a thread after making only a few stitches with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nGripe the hemp firmly between the thumb and forefinger of the left\r\nhand, leaving about eight or nine inches hanging loosely down; lay\r\nthis over the thigh of the right leg, and with the right hand rub it\r\nin a downward direction, which will cause the twisted strand to\r\nloosen. One good stroke should be sufficient; if not, it must be\r\nrepeated until the fibers forming the strand are quite loosened. By\r\nholding it close to the end with the right hand, and giving it a jerk\r\nwith the left, the fibers will break, and the ends of the strands\r\nformed in this way are placed at a little distance one above another,\r\nwhich, when twisted, form a smooth, tapering point.\r\n\r\nTo cast off a thread the proper way is to stand at a distance of about\r\nthree feet from the hook previously mentioned, and by holding the end\r\nof the hemp in the left hand, pass it over the hook and bring it down\r\nwith the right, then holding with the left and breaking as above. When\r\nsufficient strands to form the thread have been broken off, carefully\r\nexamine the points to see that they taper properly, and have no lumps\r\nin them. Rub the wax up and down a few times, so that the thread may\r\nbe properly waxed on that portion which will be inside when twisted.\r\nHold the two ends in the left hand, and with the right roll each end\r\nseparately down the right leg a sufficient number of times to twist\r\nthe thread throughout. Judgment will be required in this operation, or\r\nthe thread will be a constant source of trouble if it is over-twisted.\r\nWax it again, and then it is ready for use. See that the points are\r\nwell waxed, then take a needle and pass the point of the thread\r\nthrough the eye until it nearly reaches that part which would stop its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt must now be turned down on to the thicker portion and carefully\r\ntwisted. Smooth it down, then take the other end of thread and another\r\nneedle, and fasten it on in the same way. In selecting the awl to be\r\nused, do not take a very large one. The hole should be just large\r\nenough for the thread to require a slight pull to get it through.\r\n\r\nTo commence sewing take one side and a gusset and place them evenly\r\ntogether, the right side of the material being inside, and fix them in\r\nthe clams. Slip the welt as previously described between the edges,\r\nand pass the awl through the lot. Drive it perfectly straight, as upon\r\nthis chiefly depends a nice seam when turned. Draw out the awl, and by\r\nfollowing the point, pass up the bottom needle with the left hand.\r\nThis should be taken by the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and\r\nthe thread pulled through half its length, so forming a thread of\r\nequal length on each side. Make another hole with the awl about\r\none-third of an inch from the first. This gives the length of stitch.\r\nPass up the bottom needle as before into the right hand, the top\r\nneedle descending to the bottom immediately after. Take hold of this\r\nwith the left hand and pull through the threads simultaneously top and\r\nbottom, until the extremity on each side lies on and forms the stitch.\r\nBe careful that in pulling in the latter part each thread closes at\r\nthe same time, thereby preventing a crooked seam. Repeat until the\r\nseam is finished, then take the other gusset and place in position.\r\nSew this, then take the other side of bag and sew to the gussets. You\r\nwill then have something in the shape of a bag, minus the bottom. Take\r\nthis next, and fix each corner to one of the seams previously made,\r\nand stitch it carefully round, placing a welt in as before. At the end\r\nof each seam a stitch or two back should be taken or the thread tied\r\nover to prevent it opening.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the bag being inward, it must now be turned previous to\r\nstiffening and framing. The turning is done by placing the bag over\r\nthe left arm, and with the right hand commence pushing in one of the\r\ncorners, then the opposite one until that end is reversed. Then serve\r\nthe other end in a similar manner, and smooth each seam along.\r\n\r\nWe now take a piece of stout millboard (an old ledger book cover will\r\ndo if large enough), or, if purchased with the frame, ask for a two\r\npound board: this will cost about 4d., and be sufficient for several\r\nbags. Cut it quarter of an inch less than the bottom all round, and\r\nsee that it fits before gluing it in. To do this, place one end within\r\nthe seams at one end of the bag, and by lifting it in the middle press\r\nin the other, when the stiffening will lie within the four seams at\r\nthe bottom. Having fitted it satisfactorily, take it out again and\r\nglue it well with some good hot glue. This must be neither too thick\r\nnor too thin. The best way to prepare it is to lay some glue in cold\r\nwater for twelve hours. It will absorb sufficient water in that time,\r\nand can be boiled up without any further preparation. The quicker it\r\nis fixed after the glue is put on the better. A brush similar to a\r\npaint brush will be the best to apply it with, and need not cost more\r\nthan 6d. After the gluing, lay it aside for a few hours to allow it to\r\nthoroughly set, during which time the making of the handles can be\r\nproceeded with. On some bought bags these are very common, and seldom\r\nlast more than a few months; the usual plan being to take a piece of\r\nrope about the size of a clothes line and roll a piece of brown paper\r\nround it, covering it afterward with a piece of basil leather.\r\n\r\nProcure two pieces of brown harness leather--the shoulder of the hide\r\nis most suitable--from a saddler, 11 inches long by 1-1/8 inches wide,\r\nround the four ends, and make a compass mark 1/8 of an inch from the\r\nedge all round for the stitching. Take a piece of line as above, and\r\nplace within the leather, which most likely will have to be damped to\r\nmake it draw round easier. Leave 1½ inches from each end for sewing to\r\nthe bag, the line also being so much less than the full length of the\r\nhandles. Having sewn them, flatten the ends and bend the handles into\r\na semicircular shape, and leave them to dry.\r\n\r\nBy this time the glue holding the stiffening to the bottom of the bag\r\nwill be set, so the next move will be to put in the studs or nails.\r\nTake the largest size awl and make five punctures through the bottom,\r\nabout three-quarters of an inch from each corner and one in the\r\ncenter, as in Fig 8; push the nails through and turn down each of the\r\ntwo claws in an opposite direction, tap them with a hammer to make\r\nthem lie closer, and also to prevent them from becoming loose. This\r\ndone, we next take the frame and remove the key-plate from it.\r\n\r\nFold the sides of the bag well over the frame, so that the stitching\r\nwill get a good hold of the part that goes inside. Put a stitch\r\nthrough at each corner to hold it, and see that it sets perfectly true\r\non the frame. A space is left between the two plates of iron forming\r\nthe frame, which allows of the bag being sewn through it. Fix the\r\nkey-plate by riveting inside. Sew the bag from one corner of frame to\r\nthe other corner on each side, leaving the gussets unstitched. It is\r\nnow ready for the lining. Let this be good, as it will greatly add to\r\nthe durability of the bag if strong. Coarse linen at 8d. to 10d. per\r\nyard is the best material for this purpose. The sides and bottom may\r\nbe cut in one piece; the length of this will be twice the depth of one\r\nside of carpet (less the part which folds over the frame) and the\r\nwidth of the bottom. The width of this piece throughout to be a half\r\ninch less than the outsides were cut. The gusset lining will want to\r\nbe the same width as the gusset, but an inch less in length will do.\r\nThe seams of the lining may be stitched with an ordinary household\r\nsewing machine if good thread is used. When made, place the lining\r\ninside the bag, see that it is well down at the bottom, turn in the\r\ntop edge all round to the required size, and fix in as follows: Take a\r\nlong carpet needle and a length of thread, pass the needle through the\r\nlining at the folded ridge and bring it up again through the same at a\r\ndistance of an inch or so. This forms a stitch within the lining; pass\r\nthe needle through one of the stitches made in sewing in the frame and\r\nrepeat as before, carefully observing that the lining falls into its\r\nproper place as it is being sewn in. Continue in this way until the\r\ntwo sides are done, leaving only the gussets and gusset lining to be\r\nunited. This is done by folding the edges inward and sewing them\r\ntogether, the frame joints moving freely between the gussets and\r\nlining. We have now only the handles to put on and it is complete. Sew\r\nthese on with a five cord thread well waxed. To protect the lock\r\nagainst being unduly strained when filled, a strap and buckle may be\r\nput on between the handles and each end of the frame, as in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nNext in order is the cricket bat bag, which should always be comprised\r\nin the outfit of the amateur cricketer, as well as of the\r\nprofessional. In making this we follow the instructions given for the\r\ncarpet bag. It may be made either of carpet, tan-canvas, or leather,\r\nthe latter, of course, being the strongest and most expensive. Carpet\r\nwill not require to be described, but a brief description of\r\ntan-canvas and leather may be of service to the amateur in assisting\r\nhim to choose something for himself.\r\n\r\nTan-canvas, as used for bags and portmanteaux, is a strong, coarse\r\nmaterial of a brown color; it wears well, and has one advantage over\r\ncarpet--it is thoroughly waterproof.\r\n\r\nLeather is, of course, superior to carpet or canvas, but there are a\r\nfew tricks in its manufacture which it may not be out of place here to\r\nmention as a caution to the amateur that the old saying, \"There's\r\nnothing _like_ leather,\" is a thing of the past where the general\r\nappearance of an article is meant. The genius of the inventor has\r\nproduced machinery which gives to paper, linen, and other stuffs the\r\nappearance of the genuine article, whereas it does not contain one\r\nparticle of it. At one time, when a hide of leather was required to be\r\nof the same thickness all over it, the currier would work at the flesh\r\nof the skin with a shaving knife, gradually scraping the thick parts\r\naway until it was reduced to the required substance. Now it is done\r\nin a few minutes. The hide is passed whole between the rollers of a\r\nsplitting machine against the sharp edge of a knife, which reaches\r\nfrom one side of the machine to the other, a distance of 10 or 12\r\nfeet. This knife is so gauged that any thickness can be taken off at\r\none operation, the part taken off resembling the hide in size and\r\nshape. The top or grain of the hide is then dressed and finished off\r\nbrown, if for brown hides; or, if to be used for enameled hides, they\r\nare dyed and japanned. These are called either brown or enameled\r\ncow-hides, according as they are finished off, and are used for all\r\nthe best class of Gladstone, brief, and other bags. The bottom or\r\nfleshing of the hide is also dyed and japanned, and when finished,\r\nexactly resembles in appearance the hide itself, and is very difficult\r\nfor the novice to tell when made up into bags or any other article.\r\nThese are called _splits_, and having had the best part of the skin\r\ntaken from them, do not wear one-fourth the time the grain will. The\r\nblack enamel soon chips off, which gives them a worn-out appearance.\r\n\r\nTo make a bag 36 inches by 12 inches by 8 inches requires a frame 36\r\ninches long, the sides 36½ inches by 14 inches, gussets 14 inches by\r\n8½ inches, bottom 36½ inches by 8 inches. The lining will be 36 inches\r\nby 12 inches for the sides, gussets 13 inches by 8 inches, bottom 36\r\ninches by 8 inches. For the handles two pieces of leather 12 inches by\r\n2 inches. The straps and chapes are sewn on quite close to the frame,\r\nstraps 10 inches long by 1 inch, chapes 4½ inches by 1 inch. Cut a\r\nslit in the middle of the chape for the buckle tongue to go through,\r\nand pare the under side at the end so that it is not too lumpy when\r\nsewn on to the bag. Cut two loops 3 inches long by ¾ inch wide for the\r\npoints of straps to go through.\r\n\r\nThe brief bag must be made of leather, and as there is the same amount\r\nof work in making it, whether it be of split or hide, it will be sure\r\nto give greater satisfaction if the latter is chosen. The manufacture\r\nof this bag differs considerably from the others. The sides and\r\ngussets in the carpet bag are cut straight from top to bottom, but in\r\nthe brief bag they must be shaped to fit the frame, and give it a more\r\ncomely appearance. The frame, as before described, is quite different.\r\nThe way to commence with this bag is to open the frame as in Fig. 7,\r\nso that it will lie perfectly flat upon the bench. With the rule\r\nmeasure it carefully between the corners, A, A, and again at A, B. The\r\ndistance between A and B being less when the frame is open than when\r\nclosed, an additional ½ inch must be added to allow the gusset to bend\r\nfreely round the hinge. Having correctly taken these measurements, get\r\na sheet of brown paper and fold it in the middle; the reason for this\r\nis to allow of each side of the pattern taking the same curve at the\r\nswelled part. Cut the pattern for the sides first by ascertaining half\r\nthe distance, A, A, and marking it on to the edge of the paper,\r\nmeasuring from the folded edge toward the ends. Next mark on the\r\nfolded edge the depth you intend the bag to be, allowing in this, as\r\nin the carpet bag, 1½ inches for covering the frame. The depths of\r\nbrief bags vary so much that I will give these only as a guide,\r\nleaving my readers to add or reduce as their fancy guides them; but if\r\nthey should strictly adhere to these given below, I am certain they\r\nwill find them very useful sizes.\r\n\r\nFor a 12 inch frame cut the sides and gussets 10½ inches in depth;\r\nwhen made up, these will be 9 inches from the frame to the bottom. For\r\na 14 inch frame add 1 inch, and for a 16 inch add 2 inches. This will\r\nmake these 10 inches and 11 inches in depth respectively when made up,\r\nand either of these will be found a very useful bag for many purposes.\r\nThe width of the bottoms to be cut 5 inches, 5½ inches, and 6 inches,\r\nthe 5 inch, of course, for the 12 inch bag, the 5½ inch for the 14\r\ninch, and the 6 inch for the 16 inch. The depth having been decided\r\nupon, and marked on the folded edge of the paper, make another mark\r\nthe same distance from the edge at the first mark, H. The bottom of\r\nthe sides being 1 inch longer than the top, add ½ inch to the\r\nmeasurement of the top of pattern when the bottom part is marked off\r\nat J L. Draw a curved line between H L, as in Fig. 9, and cut through\r\nthe two thicknesses of paper at one time, keeping them well together\r\nto insure them being alike. The gusset pattern may be cut in the same\r\nway, D to D, Fig. 10, being half the distance of A B, Fig. 7, and the\r\n½ inch added for going round the joint; E E, the swelled part, which\r\nbends into the bag when the frame is closed, and also allows it to\r\nopen perfectly square; F F is half the width of the bottom of gusset.\r\nA pattern for the bottom of the bag may be made by folding a piece of\r\npaper each way to get the length and width; make a small hole through\r\nthe four thicknesses, open it and mark it from hole to hole, using the\r\nrule as a guide. This will be found to be perfectly accurate.\r\n\r\nTo cut out the bag, lay the leather on the bench, enameled side\r\ndownward, and see that the patterns lie on it so the creases will run\r\nfrom the top to bottom of the bag when made. The sides must be taken\r\nfirst, and as they are more exposed than any other part, they should\r\nbe taken from the best part of the hide. Take the gussets next, then\r\nthe bottom. The welts are taken from the cuttings which are left. To\r\nmake the handle, glue a lot of odd pieces together about 6½ inches\r\nlong, ½ inch wide, and the same thickness, and when dry pare the edges\r\naway until it is perfectly round and slightly tapering toward each\r\nend. It is then divided and glued top and bottom to a strip of good\r\nleather cut to shape, Fig. 12, which is passed through the rings at\r\neach end, and turned back to form a shape. Put a few stitches through\r\nclose to the rings before the fittings are glued on, and cover with a\r\npiece of cow-hide long enough to go through the two rings and along\r\nthe under side, then stitch it. Trim and dye the edges, rubbing them\r\nafterward with a piece of cloth to produce a polish. Before making the\r\nhandle, the plates must be on the rings, or it will prove a difficult\r\njob to get them on afterward.\r\n\r\nThe stiffening for the bottom will be cut as if for a carpet bag. Fig.\r\n11 represents the stiffening for the gussets, and is cut from a board\r\nhalf the thickness of that used for the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe linings may be cut from the outside patterns by reducing them the\r\n1½ inches, allowed for covering the frame, and 1/8 inch for each welt.\r\nA lining of scarlet or blue roan greatly adds to the appearance and\r\ndurability of a bag. A skin large enough for a 14 inch or 16 inch will\r\ncost about 3s.\r\n\r\nCow-hide for the outside is sold at 1s. 8d. per square foot, but the\r\nleather sellers frequently have pieces large enough for making a bag\r\nwhich they will sell at a slight reduction, and which answers this\r\npurpose as well as cutting a hide. In seaming the bag, take care not\r\nto wrinkle it in the clams. The welts in this must reach only to the\r\nframe, the same as in the carpet bag; the rest of the seam must be\r\nneatly closed and rubbed down, so that it will not be lumpy on the\r\nframe. Before turning the bag warm it before the fire, especially if\r\nit is cold weather. Glue in the bottom stiffening first, and then the\r\ngussets, rubbing them well down with the bone. When these are set,\r\nprepare for the operation of framing. Fold one of the sides to get the\r\nmiddle of it, cut a hole for the lock barrel about 1¼ inches from the\r\nedge, and press it over. Be careful not to cut it too large or the\r\nhole will show. Pierce a hole through the leather for the lock plate,\r\npress this tightly on the frame, and clinch the clams underneath, to\r\nhold it securely. Make holes for the handle plates and fasten them on\r\nin a similar manner. Two slits must be cut near the middle of the\r\nother side of bag, about ¾ inch from the edge, for the hasp to go\r\nthrough. This bag must be sewn to the frame all round, and care must\r\nbe taken that a sufficient fullness is allowed in the middle of the\r\ngusset to enable it to close easily round the joints of the frame. A\r\nthumbpiece must be sewn on the bag at the hasp to open it by. The\r\nlining of this bag is sewn through the frame all round in the same\r\nmanner as the side linings of the carpet bag.\r\n\r\nI hope my readers will not think that I have gone too much into\r\ndetails. It is in small things that so many failures take place. As it\r\nis much easier to do anything when you are shown than when so much has\r\nto be guessed, it is my desire to make the road for beginners as\r\nsmooth as possible, which must be my excuse if any is required. It is\r\nas well that those who intend to turn their attention to working in\r\nleather should begin by making a bag; the experience gained in\r\ncutting, fitting, putting together, and finishing will be useful when\r\nlarger and more difficult pieces of work are undertaken.--_Amateur\r\nMechanics._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLASSES, HOW MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _New England Grocer_ says that the manufacture of molasses is\r\nreally the manufacture of sugar up to a certain stage, for molasses is\r\nthe uncrystallized sirup produced in the making of sugar. The methods\r\nof manufacture in the West Indies vary very considerably. In the\r\ninterior and on the smaller plantations it is made by a very primitive\r\nprocess, while on the larger plantations all the appliances of modern\r\nscience and ingenuity are brought to bear. Each planter makes his own\r\nsugar. It is then carried to the sea coast and sold to the exporters,\r\nby whom it is shipped to this country. The quality and grade of the\r\nmolasses varies with each plantation. Two plantations side by side may\r\nproduce entirely different grades. This is owing to the soil, which in\r\nPorto Rico and other localities in the West Indies seems to change\r\nwith almost every acre. The cane from which the sugar and molasses is\r\nmade is planted by laying several pieces of it in holes or trenches.\r\nThe pieces are then covered with earth to the depth of two or three\r\ninches. In about two weeks sprouts appear above the surface. Then more\r\nearth is put in, and as the sprouts grow, earth is added until in\r\nthree or four months the holes are filled up. The planting is done\r\nfrom August to November, and the cutting progresses throughout the\r\ngreater part of the year. The cane grows to a height of seven or eight\r\nfeet, in joints each about a foot long.\r\n\r\nWhen the cane is in proper condition for cutting, as shown by its\r\nappearance, an army of workmen take possession of the field. Each is\r\narmed with a long, broad knife, like a butcher's cleaver. They move\r\ndown the lines of cane like an army, and while the cutting is going on\r\nthe fields present an interesting sight, the sword-like knives\r\nflashing in the sun, the 300 or 400 laborers, the carpet of cut cane,\r\nthe long line of moving carts, and the sea of standing cane, sometimes\r\nextending for miles and miles, stirred by the breeze into waves of\r\nundulating green. The laborers employed on these plantations are\r\nlargely negroes and Chinese coolies. When the cane is ripe, they\r\nproceed to the field, each armed with a _matchet_. Spreading over the\r\nplantation, they commence the cutting of the cane, first by one cut at\r\nthe top, which takes off the long leaves and that part which is\r\nworthless, except as fodder for the cattle. A second cut is then given\r\nas near the root as possible, as the nearer the ground the richer the\r\ncane is in juice. The cut cane is allowed to fall carelessly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOther workmen come with carts, pick it up, tie it in bundles and\r\ncarry it to the mill. The cutting of the cane is so adjusted as to\r\nkeep pace with the action of the mill, so that both are always at\r\nwork. Two gangs of men are frequently employed, and work goes on far\r\ninto the night during the season, which lasts the greater part of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, some of the methods of manufacture are very simple.\r\nIn the simplest form, the sugar cane is crushed in a mortar. The juice\r\nthus extracted is boiled in common open pans. After boiling a certain\r\nlength of time, it becomes a dark colored, soft, viscid mass. The\r\nuncrystallized sirup is expressed by putting the whole into cloth bags\r\nand subjecting them to pressure. This is molasses in a crude state. It\r\nis further purified by reboiling it with an addition of an alkaline\r\nsolution and a quantity of milk. When this has continued until scum no\r\nlonger arises, it is evaporated and then transferred to earthen jars.\r\nAfter it has been left for a few days to granulate, holes in the\r\nbottom of the jars are unstopped, and the molasses drains off into\r\nvessels placed to receive it. Another process of extracting molasses\r\nis as follows: By various processes of boiling and straining, the\r\njuice is brought to a state where it is a soft mass of crystals,\r\nembedded in a thick, but uncrystallized, fluid. The separation of this\r\nfluid is the next process, and is perfected in the curing house, so\r\ncalled. This is a large building, with a cellar which forms the\r\nmolasses reservoir. Over this reservoir is an open framework of\r\njoists, upon which stands a number of empty potting casks. Each of\r\nthese has eight or ten holes bored through the bottom, and in each\r\nhole is placed the stalk of a plantain leaf. The soft, concrete mass\r\nof sugar is removed from the cooling pans in which it has been brought\r\nfrom the boilers and placed in the casks. The molasses then gradually\r\ndrains from the crystallized portion into the reservoir below,\r\npercolating through the spongy plantain stalks.\r\n\r\nOn the larger plantations, machinery of very elaborate description is\r\nused, and the most advanced processes known to science are employed in\r\nthe manufacture. The principle is, however, the same as has been seen\r\nin the account of the simpler processes. On these larger plantations\r\nthere are extensive buildings, quarters for workmen, steam engines,\r\nand all the necessary adjuncts of advanced manufacturing science. In\r\nthe sugar mills the cut cane is carried in carts to the mill. It is\r\nthen thrown by hand upon an endless flexible conductor which carries\r\nthe cane between heavy crushers. The great jaws of the crushers press\r\nthe cane into pulp, when it is thrown aside automatically to be carted\r\naway and used as a fertilizer. The juice runs off in the channels of\r\nthe conductor into huge pans. The juice is now of a dull gray color\r\nand of a sweet, pleasant taste, and is known as _guarapo_. It must be\r\nclarified at once, for it is of so fermentable a nature that in the\r\nclimate of Porto Rico it will run into fermentation inside of half an\r\nhour if the process of clarifying is not commenced. The pans into\r\nwhich the juice is conducted are pierced like a colander. The liquor\r\nruns through, leaving the refuse matter behind. It is then forced into\r\ntanks by a pump and run to the clarifiers, which are large kettles\r\nheated by steam. Lime is used to assist the clarification. It is then\r\nfiltered into vats filled with bone black. The filtering is repeated\r\nuntil the juice changes color, when it is conveyed to the vacuum pans.\r\nIt has now become a thick sirup. It is then pumped into the sirup\r\nclarifiers, skimmed, and again run through bone black, and finally is\r\nconducted into another kettle, where it is allowed to crystallize. The\r\nsirup that fails to crystallize is molasses, and it is here that we\r\ncatch up with what we started after. To extract the molasses from the\r\ncrystallized mass of sugar, we must go to the purging house. This is\r\nsimilar to the building spoken of in connection with the simpler\r\nprocess. It is of two stories. The upper floor is merely a series of\r\nstrong frames with apertures for funnel-shaped cylinders. The sugar is\r\nbrought into the purging house in great pans, which are placed over\r\nthe funnels. The pans are pierced with holes through which the\r\nmolasses drains off into troughs which are underneath the floor, all\r\nrunning to a main trough. From thence the molasses runs into vats,\r\ncalled _bocoyes_, each of which holds from 1,200 to 1,500 gallons. The\r\nhogsheads in which the molasses is brought to this country are\r\nmanufactured principally in Philadelphia and taken to the West Indies.\r\nThey are placed in the hold of the vessel and the molasses pumped into\r\nthem. The government standard for molasses is 56 degrees polarization.\r\nWhen not above that test, the duty is four cents per gallon. Above it\r\nthe duty is eight cents. This tends to keep molasses pure, as the\r\naddition of glucose increases the quantity of sugar and therefore of\r\nthe polarization, and would make necessary the payment of increased\r\nduties. The adulteration of molasses is therefore largely if not\r\nwholly done after it is out of bond and in the hands of the jobber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE IRON MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for the illustrations and the particulars to Dr.\r\nPercy's invaluable book on iron and steel (probably it is not saying\r\ntoo much to describe it as the best work on the subject ever written).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF INDIAN BLAST FURNACE AND BLOWING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a sectional elevation, and Fig. 2 shows a plan of furnace\r\nand bellows and tuyeres, indeed, an entire ironworks plant used in\r\nIndia, not only now, but, so far as we can gather, from time\r\nimmemorial. The two figures give a sufficiently clear idea of the form\r\nof furnace used in Lower Bengal, in which portion of our Indian empire\r\nthere are entire villages exclusively inhabited by iron smelters, who,\r\nsad to relate, are distinguished from the agricultural villages\r\nsurrounding them by their filth, poverty, and generally degraded\r\ncondition. There are whole tribes in India who have no other\r\noccupation than iron smelting. They, of course, sink no shafts and\r\nopen no mines, and are not permanent in any place. They simply remain\r\nin one place so long as plentiful supplies of ore and wood are\r\nobtainable in the immediate vicinity. In many cases the villages\r\nformerly inhabited by them have passed out of existence, but the\r\nwaste, or rather wasted products, of their operations remain.\r\n\r\nThe furnace shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is built of the sandy soil of the\r\ndistrict, moistened and kneaded and generally strengthened by a sort\r\nof skeleton of strips of flexible wood. In form it varies from a\r\ncylinder, more or less circular, diverging into a tolerably acute\r\ncone, the walls being about 3 in. thick. The height is generally\r\nabout 3 ft. and the mean internal diameter about 1 ft., but all these\r\ndimensions vary with different workmen and in different localities.\r\nThere are two apertures at the base of the furnace; one in front,\r\nabout 1 ft. in height, and rather less in width than the internal\r\ndiameter of the furnace, through which, when the smelting of one\r\ncharge is finished, the resulting mass of spongy iron is extracted,\r\nand which during the smelting is well plastered up, the small conical\r\ntuyere being inserted at the bottom. This tuyere is usually made of\r\nthe same material as the furnace--namely, of a sandy soil; worked by\r\nhand into the required form and sun-dried; but sometimes no other\r\ntuyere is employed than a lump of moist clay with a hole in it, into\r\nwhich the bamboo pipes communicating with the bellows are inserted.\r\nThe other aperture is smaller, and placed at one side of the furnace,\r\nand chiefly below the ground, forming a communication between the\r\nbottom of the furnace chamber and a small trench into which the slag\r\nflows and filters out through a small pile of charcoal. It is this\r\nslag being found in places where iron is not now made that shows that\r\niron smelting was an occupation there, perhaps many centuries before.\r\n\r\nThe inclined tray shown at the top of the furnace on Fig. 1 is made of\r\nthe same material as the furnace itself, and when kneaded into shape\r\nis supported on a wooden framework. On it is piled a supply of\r\ncharcoal, which is raked into the furnace when required.\r\n\r\nThe blowing apparatus is singularly ingenious, and is certainly as\r\neconomical of manual labor as a blowing arrangement depending on\r\nmanual labor well can be. A section of the bellows forms the portion\r\nto the right of Fig. 1, showing tuyere forming the connection between\r\nbellows and furnace. It consists of a circular segment of hard wood,\r\nrudely hollowed, and having a piece of buffalo hide with a small hole\r\nin its center tied over the top. Into this hole a strong cord is\r\npassed, with a small piece of wood attached to the end to keep it\r\ninside the bellows, while the other end is attached to a bent bamboo\r\nfirmly fixed into the ground close by. This bamboo acts as a spring,\r\ndrawing up the string, and consequently the leather cover of the\r\nbellows, to its utmost stretch, while air enters through the central\r\nhole. When thus filled, a man places his foot on the hide, closing the\r\ncentral hole with his heel, and then throwing the whole weight of his\r\nbody on to that foot, he depresses the hide, and drives the air out\r\nthrough a bamboo tube inserted in the side and communicating with the\r\nfurnace. At the same time he pulls down the bamboo with the arm of\r\nthat side. Two such bellows are placed side by side, a thin bamboo\r\ntube attached to each, and both entering the one tuyere; and so by\r\njumping on each bellows alternately, the workman keeps up a continuous\r\nblast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--PLAN OF INDIAN BLAST FURNACE AND BLOWING\r\nMACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe Figs. 1 and 2 are taken from sketches, and the description from\r\nparticulars, by Mr. Blandford, who was for some years on the\r\nGeological Survey of India, and had exceptional opportunities in his\r\njourneyings of observing the customs and occupations of the Indian\r\niron smelters. The blowing machine is an especially wonderful and\r\neffective machine, and was first described and illustrated by Mr.\r\nRobert Rose, in a Calcutta publication, more than half a century ago.\r\nHe also had seen it used in iron making in India.--_Colliery\r\nGuardian._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWood oil is now made on a large scale in Sweden from the refuse of\r\ntimber cuttings and forest clearings, and from stumps and roots.\r\nAlthough it cannot well be burned in common lamps, on account of the\r\nheavy proportion of carbon it contains, it is said to furnish a\r\nsatisfactory light in lamps specially made for it; and in its natural\r\nstate it is the cheapest illuminating oil. There are some thirty\r\nfactories engaged in its production, and they turn out about 40,000\r\nliters of the oil daily. Turpentine, creosote, acetic acid, charcoal,\r\ncoal-tar oils, etc., are also obtained from the same materials as the\r\nwood oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAP.\r\n\r\nBy HENRY LEFFMANN, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of soap dates from a rather remote period, the\r\nchemist is still living, at an advanced age, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor a knowledge of its composition and mode of formation. Considerably\r\nmore than a generation has elapsed since Chevreul announced these\r\nfacts, but a full appreciation of the principles involved is scarcely\r\nrealized outside of the circle of professional chemists. Learned\r\nmedical and physiological writers often speak of glycerin as the\r\n\"sweet principle of fats,\" or term fats compounds of fatty acids and\r\nglycerin. Indeed, there is little doubt that the great popularity of\r\nglycerin as an emollient arose from the view that it represented the\r\nessential base of the fats. With regard to soap, also, much erroneous\r\nand indistinct impression prevails. Its detergent action is sometimes\r\nsupposed to be due to the free alkali, whereas a well-made soap is\r\npractically neutral.\r\n\r\nA desire to secure either an increased detergent, cleansing, or other\r\nlocal effect has led in recent years to the introduction into soaps of\r\na large number of substances, some of which have been chosen without\r\nmuch regard to their chemical relations to the soap itself. The result\r\nhas been the enrichment of the materia medica with a collection of\r\narticles of which some are useful, and others worse than useless. The\r\nextension of the list of disinfectant and antiseptic agents and the\r\nincreased importance of the agents, in surgery, have naturally\r\nsuggested the plan of incorporating them with soaps, in which form\r\nthey will be most convenient for application. Accordingly, the\r\ncirculars of the manufacturing pharmacists have prominently displayed\r\nthe advantages of various disinfecting soaps.\r\n\r\nAmong these is a so-called corrosive sublimate soap, of which several\r\nbrands are on sale. One of these, containing one per cent. of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, is put on the market in cakes weighing about\r\nsixteen hundred grains, and each cake, therefore, contains sixteen\r\ngrains of the drug--a rather large quantity, perhaps, when it is\r\nremembered that four grains is a fatal dose. Fortunately, however, for\r\nthe prevention of accidents, but unfortunately for the therapeutic\r\nvalue of the soap, a decomposition of the sublimate occurs as soon as\r\nit is incorporated in the soap mass, by which an insoluble mercurial\r\nsoap is formed. This change takes place independently of the alkali\r\nused in the soap; in fact, as mentioned above, a well-made soap\r\ncontains no appreciable amount of free alkali, but is due to the\r\naction of the fat acids. Corrosive sublimate is _incompatible_ with\r\nany ordinary soap mass, and this incompatibility includes not only\r\nother soluble mercurial salts, but also almost all the mineral\r\nantiseptics, such as zinc chloride, copper sulphate, iron salts. Some\r\nof the preparations of arsenic may, however, be incorporated with soap\r\nwithout decomposition.\r\n\r\nSuch being the chemical facts, we must admit that no reliance can be\r\nplaced in corrosive sublimate soaps as germicide agents. It must not\r\nbe supposed that this incompatibility interferes with the use of these\r\nsoaps for general therapeutic purposes. It is only the specific\r\ngermicide value which is destroyed. Since the fats used in soap\r\nmanufacture yield oleic acid, we will have a certain amount of\r\nmercuric oleates formed together with stearate and other salts, and\r\nfor purposes of inunction these salts might be efficient. Still the\r\nphysician would prefer, doubtless, to use the specially prepared\r\nmercurial.\r\n\r\nIn producing, therefore, a disinfecting soap, being debarred from\r\nusing the metallic germicides, we are fortunate in the possession of a\r\nnumber of efficient agents, organic in character, which may be used\r\nwithout interference in soaps.\r\n\r\nAmong these are thymol, naphthol, oil of eucalyptus, carbolates, and\r\nsalicylates. There is no chemical incompatibility of these with soap,\r\nand as they are somewhat less active, weight for weight, than\r\ncorrosive sublimate, they are capable of use in larger quantities with\r\nless danger, and can thus be made equally efficacious.\r\n\r\nIt is in this direction, therefore, that we must look for the\r\nproduction of a safe and reliable antiseptic soap.\r\n\r\nThere is not much exact knowledge as to the usefulness of such\r\nadditions to soap as borax and glycerin. They are frequently added,\r\nand highly spoken of in advertisements. Borax is a mild alkaline body,\r\nand as a detergent is probably equivalent to a slight excess of\r\ncaustic soda. Glycerin, although originally considered an emollient,\r\nprobably on account of its source and physical properties, is in\r\nreality, to some skins at least, a slight irritant. It is, in fact, an\r\nalcohol, not a fat. It does not pre-exist in fats, but is formed when\r\nthe fat is decomposed by alkali or steam.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases, soap owes its detergent effect to a decomposition\r\nwhich occurs when it is put in water.\r\n\r\nA perfectly neutral soap, that is, one which contains the exact\r\nproportion of alkali and fat acid, will, when placed in cold water,\r\ndecompose into two portions, one containing an excess of the acid, the\r\nother an excess of alkali. The latter dissolves, and gives a slightly\r\nalkaline solution; the former precipitates, and gives the peculiar\r\nturbidity constituting \"suds.\" These reactions must be kept in mind in\r\ndetermining the effect of the addition of any special substance to the\r\nsoap.--_The Polyclinic._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL ERRORS AND HUMAN MISTAKES.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Read before the American Association, Buffalo,\r\n  August, 1886.]\r\n\r\nBy ERNST GUNDLACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to call attention to a few mistakes that are quite commonly\r\nmade by microscopists and writers in stating the result of their\r\noptical tests of microscope objectives.\r\n\r\nIf the image of an object as seen in the microscope appears to be\r\nunusually distorted and indistinct toward the edge of the field, and\r\nsatisfactory definition is limited to a small portion of the center,\r\nthe cause is often attributed to the spherical aberration of the\r\nobjective, while really this phenomenon has nothing to do with that\r\noptical defect of the objective, if any exists, but is caused by a\r\nlack of optical symmetry. If a perfectly symmetrical microscope\r\nobjective could be constructed, then, with any good eye-piece, it\r\nwould make no difference to the definition of the object were it\r\nplaced either in the center or at the edge of the field, even if the\r\nobjective had considerable spherical aberration. But, unfortunately,\r\nour most symmetrical objectives, the low powers, leave much to be\r\ndesired in this respect, while our wide angle, high powers are very\r\nfar from symmetrical perfection.\r\n\r\nThere are two causes of this defect in the latter objectives, one\r\nbeing the extreme wideness of their angular apertures, and the other\r\nthe great difference in the distances of the object and the image from\r\nthe optical center of the objectives.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake is often made in regard to the cause of certain\r\nprismatic colors that are sometimes, in a striking degree, produced by\r\notherwise good objectives. According to the nature of these colors,\r\nwhether yellow or blue, green or indigo, they are generally regarded\r\nas evidences of either chromatic over or under correction of the\r\nobjective. Of course the presence of either of these defects is\r\ncertainly and correctly indicated by the appearance of one or the\r\nother of the colors, under certain circumstances; but the simple\r\nvisibility of prismatic color is by no means a reliable indication of\r\nover or under correction of color, and, indeed, to the honor of our\r\nopticians, it may be stated that very few objectives are made that\r\ncannot justly be called achromatic in the general sense of the term.\r\nBy far the most common causes of prismatic color, in otherwise\r\ncarefully constructed objectives, are the so-called chromatic\r\naberrations of second or higher order. Every achromatic lens which is,\r\nas it should be, at its best at about two-thirds of its aperture, is\r\ninside of this ring or zone, toward the center slightly under and\r\noutside, toward the edge, slightly over corrected. This defect is the\r\ngreater, the less the difference of the dispersive powers of the two\r\nglasses used in the construction of the lens, for a given proportion\r\nof their refractive indexes, and therefore the degree of visibility of\r\nthe colors of the aberrations of the second order depends greatly on\r\nthe nature of the glass employed in the construction of the lens.\r\n\r\nThis defect may be corrected by a suitable combination of two or more\r\nlenses, though not without again having similarly, as in the\r\ncorrection of the first color, some faint remnants of color, the\r\naberrations of third or still higher order. But even the correction of\r\nthe third or still higher order may, if the angular aperture is very\r\nwide, leave quite visible and disturbing remnants of color.\r\n\r\nAnother and not uncommon explanation of the cause of this unwelcome\r\ncolor, though not so serious and damaging a charge to the maker of the\r\nobjectives, is its attribution to the so-called \"secondary spectrum.\"\r\nThis error, like that previously mentioned, is certainly indicated by\r\nthe appearance of certain colors under certain conditions, but being,\r\nas a rule, one of the least defects of even our best objectives in\r\nmost cases, it is probably not the true source of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe secondary spectrum is very commonly confounded with the chromatic\r\naberration of higher order. While the latter is produced by\r\nimperfections in the form of the lens, the former is due to an\r\nimperfection of the optical qualities of the material from which the\r\nlens is constructed, the crown and flint glass.\r\n\r\nA glass prism of any angle will project upon a white surface a\r\nspectrum of any length, according to the arrangement of the light\r\nsource, the screen, and the prism. So with two prisms of the same kind\r\nof glass, but of different angles, two spectra can be produced of\r\nexactly equal length, so that if one is brought over the other, with\r\nthe corresponding colors in line, they will appear as one spectrum.\r\nBut if one of the prisms is made of crown and the other of flint\r\nglass, then their spectra cannot be arranged so that all their\r\ncorresponding colors would be in line, for the proportional distances\r\nof the different colors differ in the two spectra. If two colors of\r\nthe spectra are, by suitable arrangement, brought exactly in line,\r\nthen the others will be out. The two spectra do not coincide, and the\r\nresult, if an achromatic lens be made of these glasses, must be a\r\nremnant of color which cannot be neutralized. This remnant is the\r\nsecondary spectrum.\r\n\r\nAlthough this peculiar disharmony in the dispersive powers of the two\r\nglasses, crown and flint, was discovered almost immediately after\r\nachromatism was invented, it was only recently that the first\r\nsuccessful attempts were made to produce different glasses, which,\r\npossessing the other requirements for achromatic objectives, would\r\nproduce coincident spectra, or nearer so than the ordinary crown and\r\nflint glass do. It was about twelve years ago, if my memory serves me,\r\nwhen I learned that a well-known English firm, engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of optical glass, had brought out some new glass possessed\r\nof the desired qualities, and a little later I received a circular\r\ndescribing the glass. But at the same time I learned that the new\r\nglass was very soft and difficult to polish, and also that it had to\r\nbe protected from the atmosphere, and further, that an English\r\noptician had failed to construct an improved telescope objective from\r\nit. I had ordered some samples of the glass, but never received any.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, news from Europe reached this country that another\r\nand seemingly more successful attempt had been made to produce glass\r\nthat would leave no secondary spectrum, and that Dr. Zeiss, the famous\r\nJena optician, had constructed some new improved objectives from it.\r\nBut the somewhat meager description of these objectives, as given by\r\nan English microscopist, did not seem fit to excite much enthusiasm\r\nhere as to their superiority over what had already been done in this\r\ncountry. Besides this, the report said that the new objectives were\r\nfive system, and also that extra eye-pieces had to be used with them.\r\nI confess I am much inclined to attribute the optical improvement,\r\nwhich, according to Dr. Abbe's own remark, is very little, more to the\r\nfact that the objectives are five system than to the new glass used in\r\ntheir construction.\r\n\r\nAfter a close study of a descriptive list of the new glass, received a\r\nweek or two ago from the manufacturers, I find, to my great regret,\r\nthat this new glass seems to suffer from a similar weakness to that\r\nmade by the English firm twelve years ago; as all the numbers of the\r\nlist pointed out by the makers as having a greatly reduced secondary\r\nspectrum are accompanied with the special remark \"to be protected.\"\r\nFurthermore, from a comparison of the dispersive and refractive powers\r\nof these glasses, as given in the list, I find that objectives\r\nconstructed from them will leave so great aberrations of higher order,\r\nboth spherical and chromatic, that the gain by the reduction of the\r\nsecondary spectrum would be greatly overbalanced.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that while I would beware of\r\nunderestimating the great scientific and practical value of the\r\nendeavor of the new German glass makers to produce improved optical\r\nglass, and the great benefit accruing to opticians and all others\r\ninterested in the use of optical instruments, I think it wise not to\r\noverestimate the real value of the defects of the common crown and\r\nflint glass, which I have sought to explain in this paper. And, for\r\nmyself, I prefer to fight the more serious defects first, and when its\r\ntime has come I will see what can be done with the secondary spectrum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE ISOLATION OF FLUORINE. DECOMPOSITION OF HYDROFLUORIC ACID\r\nBY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT.\r\n\r\nBy M.H. MOISSAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former memoir[1] we showed that it was possible to decompose\r\nanhydrous hydrofluoric acid by the action of an electric current. At\r\nthe negative pole hydrogen collects; at the positive pole a gaseous\r\nbody is disengaged, having novel properties. The experiment was\r\nperformed in a platinum U tube, closed by stoppers of fluorite, and\r\nhaving at the upper part of each branch a small delivery tube, also of\r\nplatinum. Through the stopper passes a platinum rod, which acts as\r\nelectrode. The metal employed for the positive pole is an alloy\r\ncontaining 10 per cent. of iridium.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Comptes Rendus_, vol. cii., p. 1543, and _Chemical\r\n  News_, vol. liv., p. 36.]\r\n\r\nTo obtain pure anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, we begin by preparing\r\nfluorhydrate of fluoride of potassium, taking all the precautions\r\npointed out by M. Fremy. When the salt is obtained pure, it is dried\r\non a water bath at 100°, and the platinum capsule containing it is\r\nthen placed in a vacuum in the presence of concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid, and two or three sticks of potash fused in a silver crucible.\r\nThe acid and potash are renewed every morning for a fortnight, and the\r\nvacuum is kept at 2 cm. of mercury. Care must be taken during this\r\ndesiccation to pulverize the salt every day in an iron mortar, so as\r\nto renew the surface. When the fluorhydrate contains no more water it\r\nfalls to powder, and is then fit to serve for the preparation of\r\nfluoric acid; the fluorhydrate of fluoride of potassium, if well\r\nprepared, is much less deliquescent than the fluoride.\r\n\r\nWhen the fluoride is quite dry, it is quickly introduced into a\r\nplatinum alembic, which has just been dried by heating it to redness.\r\nThe whole is kept at a gentle temperature for an hour or an hour and a\r\nhalf, so as to allow the decomposition to commence very slowly; the\r\nfirst portions of acid which come over are rejected as they carry with\r\nthem traces of water remaining in the salt. The platinum receiver is\r\nthen attached, and the heat increased, allowing the decomposition to\r\nproceed with a certain degree of slowness. The receiver is then\r\nsurrounded with a mixture of ice and salt, and from this moment all\r\nthe hydrofluoric acid is condensed as a limpid liquid, boiling at\r\n19.5°, very hygroscopic, and, as is well known, giving abundant fumes\r\nin presence of the atmospheric moisture.\r\n\r\nDuring this operation the platinum U tube, dried with the greatest\r\ncare, has been fixed with a cork in a cylindrical glass vessel\r\nsurrounded with chloride of methyl. Up to the moment of introducing\r\nthe hydrofluoric acid, the leading tubes are attached to drying tubes\r\ncontaining fused caustic potash. To introduce the hydrochloric acid\r\ninto the apparatus, it may be absorbed through one of the lateral\r\ntubes in the receiver in which it is condensed.\r\n\r\nIn some experiments we have directly condensed the hydrofluoric acid\r\nin the U tube surrounded with chloride of methyl; but in this case\r\ncare must be taken that the tubes are not clogged up by small\r\nquantities of fluoride carried over, which would infallibly lead to an\r\nexplosion and projections, which are always dangerous with so\r\ncorrosive a liquid.\r\n\r\nWhen we have introduced in advance in the small platinum apparatus a\r\ndetermined amount of hydrofluoric acid cooled with chloride of methyl,\r\nin tranquil ebullition at a temperature of -23°, the current of 20\r\ncells of Bunsen large size, arranged in series, is passed through by\r\nmeans of the electrodes. An amperemeter in the circuit admits of the\r\nintensity of the current being observed.\r\n\r\nIf the hydrofluoric acid contains a small quantity of water, either by\r\naccident or design, there is always disengaged at the positive pole\r\nozone, which has no action on crystallized silicium. In proportion as\r\nthe water contained in the acid is thus decomposed, it is seen by the\r\namperemeter that the conductivity of the liquid rapidly decreases.\r\nWith absolutely anhydrous hydrofluoric acid the current will no longer\r\npass. In many of our experiments we have succeeded in obtaining an\r\nacid so anhydrous that a current of 25 amperes was entirely arrested.\r\n\r\nTo render the liquid conducting, we have added before each experiment\r\na small quantity of dried and fused fluorhydrate of fluoride of\r\npotassium. In this case, decomposition proceeds in a continuous\r\nmanner; we obtain at the negative pole hydrogen, and at the positive\r\npole a regular disengagement of a colorless gas in which crystallized\r\nsilicium in the cold burns with great brilliancy, becoming fluoride of\r\nsilicium. This latter gas has been collected over mercury, and\r\naccurately characterized.\r\n\r\nDeville's adamantine boron burns in the same manner, but with more\r\ndifficulty, becoming fluoride or boron. The small quantity of carbon\r\nand aluminum which it contains impedes the combination. Arsenic and\r\nantimony in powder combine with this gaseous body with incandescence.\r\nSulphur takes fire in it, and iodine combines with a pale flame,\r\nlosing its color. We have already remarked that it decomposes cold\r\nwater, producing ozone and hydrofluoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe metals are attacked with much less energy. This is due, we think,\r\nto the small quantity of metallic fluoride formed preventing the\r\naction being very deep. Iron and manganese in powder, slightly heated,\r\nburn with sparks. Organic bodies are violently attacked. A piece of\r\ncork placed near the end of the platinum tube, where the gas is\r\nevolved, immediately carbonizes and inflames. Alcohol, ether, benzol,\r\nspirit of turpentine, and petroleum take fire on contact.\r\n\r\nThe gas evolved at the negative pole is hydrogen, burning with a pale\r\nflame, and producing none of these reactions.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment has lasted several hours, and there is not enough\r\nhydrofluoric acid left at the bottom of the tube to separate the two\r\ngases, they recombine in the apparatus in the cold, with violent\r\ndetonation.\r\n\r\nWe have satisfied ourselves, by direct experiment, that a mixture of\r\nozone and hydrofluoric acid produces none of the reactions described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with gaseous hydrofluoric acid. Finally we may add that\r\nthe hydrofluoric acid employed, as well as the hydrofluorate of\r\nfluoride, were absolutely free from chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe gas obtained in our experiments is therefore either fluorine or a\r\nperfluoride of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nNew experiments are necessary to settle this last point. We hope soon\r\nto lay the results before the Academy.--_Comptes Mendus_, vol. ciii.,\r\np. 202, July 19, 1886; _Chem.

A Law of Solubility._\r\n\r\nIt is customary to regard cohesion as the force which binds together\r\nmolecules of the same substance, and in virtue of which the particles\r\nof solids and liquids are kept together, and also to speak of the\r\nattraction exerted between particles of two different bodies as\r\nadhesion. The distinction between cohesion and adhesion is a\r\nconventional one. The similarity, if not identity, of the two forces\r\nis demonstrated by the fact that while cohesion is exerted between\r\nparticles of the _same_ body, adhesion is exerted with most force\r\nbetween particles of _allied_ bodies. Generally speaking, organic\r\nbodies require organic solvents; inorganic bodies, inorganic solvents.\r\nFor example, common salt is highly soluble in water, but not in ether,\r\nand many fats are soluble in ether, but not in water. So many cases\r\nlike these will suggest themselves to the chemist that I am justified\r\nin making the following generalization: _A body will dissolve in a\r\nsolvent to which it is allied more readily than in one to which it in\r\nhighly dissimilar._ Exceptions to the law undoubtedly exist, but none\r\nso striking as the following in support of it, viz., that the metal\r\nmercury is the only known true solvent for many metals at the normal\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2. Its Connection with Mendeleeff's Periodic Law._\r\n\r\nFrom this standpoint the whole subject of solution is deserving of\r\nfresh attention, as it appears highly probable that, just as Prof.\r\nCarnelley has shown by the use of my meta-chromatic scale, the colors\r\nof chemical compounds come under definite laws, which he has\r\ndiscovered and formulated in connection with Mendeleeff and Newlaud's\r\nperiodic law,[2] so, likewise, may the solubility of an allied group\r\nof compounds, in regard to any given solvent under constant conditions\r\nof temperature, conform to similar laws; that, e.g., the chlorides\r\nof H, Na, Cu, and Ag, in Mendeleeff's Group I., may vary in their\r\nsolubility in water from an extreme of high solubility in the case of\r\nhydrogen chloride to the opposite extreme of comparative insolubility\r\nin the case of silver chloride. In this natural series of compounds,\r\nhydrogen chloride is the body nearest akin to water, and silver\r\nchloride the most remote in kinship.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: _Philosophical Magazine_, August, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_3. A Solidified Vortex Ring._\r\n\r\nIt is in virtue of cohesion that a freely suspended drop of liquid\r\nassumes the spherical form. If such a sphere be dropped on to the\r\nsurface of a liquid of higher specific gravity at rest, one obtains\r\nwhat is called the cohesion figure of the substance of the drop. A\r\ndrop of oil, e.g., spreads out on the surface of water until it is a\r\ncircular thin film of concentric rings of different degrees of\r\nthickness, each displaying the characteristic colors of thin plates.\r\nThe tenuity of the film increases; its cohesion is overcome; lakelets\r\nare formed, and they merge into each other. The disintegrated portions\r\nof the film now thicken, the colors vanish, and only islets of oil\r\nremain. Some liquid drops of the same or higher sp. gr. than water do\r\nnot spread out in this fashion, but descend below the surface of the\r\nliquid, and, in descending, assume a ring shape, which gradually\r\nspreads out and breaks up into lesser rings. Such figures have been\r\ntermed submergence cohesion figures; they are vortex rings. I have\r\nsolidified such vortex rings in their first stage of formation. If\r\ndrops of melted sulphur, at a temperature above that of the viscous\r\nstate, be let fall into water, the drops will be solidified in the\r\neffort to form the ring, and the circular button, thick in the rim and\r\nthin in the center, may be regarded as a solidified vortex ring of\r\nplastic sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4. That a Submergence Cohesion Figure is a Vortex Ring._\r\n\r\nIt may be shown that the conditions of the formation of a submergence\r\ncohesion figure are those which exist in the formation of an aerial\r\nvortex. Those conditions in their greatest perfection are (1) a\r\nspherical envelope of a different nature from the medium in which the\r\nrings are produced; (2) a circular orifice opening into the medium;\r\nand (3) a percussive impact on the part of the sphere opposite the\r\norifice. In the production of vortex rings of phosphorus pentoxide in\r\nthe making of phosphoreted hydrogen, the spherical envelope is water,\r\nthe orifice the portion of the bubble which opens into the air\r\nimmediately it rises to the surface, and the impact is furnished by\r\ngravity. So, also, in the case of a submergence cohesion figure, the\r\nspherical envelope is the air surrounding the drop, the orifice the\r\nportion of it which first comes in contact with the liquid at rest;\r\nand here again the impact is due to gravity more directly than in the\r\nformer case. These conditions are somewhat imperfectly copied in the\r\nordinary vortex box, which is usually cubical in form, with a circular\r\norifice in one side, and a covering of canvas on the opposite one,\r\nwhich is hit with the fist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[AMERICAN CHEMICAL JOURNAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINATION OF NITRIC ACID BY THE ABSORPTION OF NITRIC OXIDE\r\nIN A STANDARD SOLUTION OF PERMANGANATE OF POTASSIUM.\r\n\r\nBy H.N. MORSE and A.F. LINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method which we propose consists in the conversion of the nitric\r\nacid into nitric oxide; the absorption of the latter in a measured,\r\nbut excessive, quantity of a standard solution of permanganate of\r\npotassium; and the subsequent determination of the excess of the\r\npermanganate by means of a standard solution of oxalic acid or\r\nsulphate of manganese.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nA is an apparatus for the generation of carbon dioxide free from air,\r\nwhich will be explained hereafter.\r\n\r\nB is a flask, having a capacity of 125 or 150 c.c., in which the\r\nnitrate is decomposed in the usual manner by means of ferrous chloride\r\nand hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nC is a small tube for the condensation of the aqueous hydrochloric\r\nacid which distills over from B.\r\n\r\nD is a Geissler bulb, containing a concentrated solution of potassium\r\ncarbonate, to arrest any acid vapors coming from C.\r\n\r\nE, E are two pieces of ordinary combustion tubing, having a length of\r\nabout 650 or 700 mm., in which is placed the permanganate solution\r\nemployed for the absorption of the nitric oxide. Their open ends are\r\nprovided with lips in order to facilitate the pouring of liquids from\r\nthem, care being taken not to so distort the ends that rubber stoppers\r\ncannot be made to fit them tightly. They are placed in a nearly\r\nhorizontal position in order to diminish the pressure required to\r\nforce the gases through the apparatus and thus lessen the danger of\r\nleakage through the rubber joints.\r\n\r\n_a_ is a tube through which the ferrous chloride and hydrochloric acid\r\nare introduced into B, as in the method of Tiemann-Schulze.\r\n\r\n_b_ serves for the introduction of carbon dioxide to expel the air\r\nbefore the decomposition of the nitrate, and the nitric oxide\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n_c_ is an unbroken tube ending at the lower surface of the stopper in\r\nB, and at the bottom of C.\r\n\r\nThe rubber joint, _d_, is furnished with a Mohr and also a screw pinch\r\ncock. The joints, _e_ and _f_, are furnished with Mohr pinch cocks.\r\nThe rubber tubing upon these should be of the best quality, and must\r\nbe carefully tied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETERMINATION OF NITRIC ACID.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the large volume of the permanganate solution\r\nrequired for the complete absorption of the nitric oxide, we have\r\nfound it advantageous to use three solutions instead of two.\r\n\r\n1. A solution of permanganate such that one c.c. is equivalent to\r\nabout fifteen milligrammes of nitrate of potassium, according to the\r\nreaction:\r\n\r\n  KMnO_{4} + NO = KNO_{3} + MnO_{2}.\r\n\r\nThis solution is employed for the absorption of the nitric oxide. Its\r\nstrength need not be exactly known. There is no objection to a more\r\nconcentrated solution, except that which pertains to all strong\r\nstandard solutions, namely, that a small error in measurement would\r\nthen give a larger error in the results. 100 c.c. of this solution are\r\nrequired for each determination, and the measurement is always made in\r\none and the same 100 c.c. measuring flask, which, if necessary, should\r\nbe labeled to distinguish it from that used for solution No. 2.\r\n\r\n2. A solution of oxalic acid which is very slightly stronger than that\r\nof the permanganate just described--that is, a solution such that one\r\nc.c. of it will somewhat more than decompose one c.c. of the\r\npermanganate, according to the reaction:\r\n\r\n  2KMnO_{4} + 3H_{2}SO_{4} + 5C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}.2H_{2}O =\r\n  K_{2}SO_{4} + 2MnSO_{4} + 18H_{2}O + 10CO_{2}.\r\n\r\nThe exact strength of this solution need not be known, since we only\r\nrequire the difference in value between it and solution No. 1, which\r\nis determined by means of solution No. 3. 100 c.c. of this solution\r\nare also required for each determination, and the measurement, as in\r\nthe preceding case, is always made in the same 100 c.c. measuring\r\nflask.\r\n\r\n3. A dilute, carefully standardized solution of permanganate of\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\nThe method of using these solutions is as follows: 100 c.c. of No. 1\r\nand No. 2 are measured off (each solution in its own measuring flask),\r\nbrought together in a covered beaker glass, and acidified with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. The excess of oxalic acid is then determined by means\r\nof solution No. 3.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to make a determination of nitric acid, 100 c.c. of\r\nsolution No. 1 are measured off, and as much of it as may be\r\nconvenient is poured into the tubes, E, E, together with about a\r\ngramme of zinc sulphate for each tube, which substance appears to\r\nconsiderably facilitate the absorption of the nitric oxide by the\r\npermanganate. When the operation is over, the contents of E, E are\r\npoured into a beaker glass. 100 c.c. of solution No. 2 are then\r\nmeasured off, and a portion, together with a little sulphuric acid,\r\npoured into E, E, to dissolve the oxide of manganese which has\r\nseparated during the absorption of the nitric oxide. The oxide having\r\nbeen dissolved, the liquid in E, E, and the rinsings of the tubes,\r\nalso the residues of permanganate and oxalic acid left in the\r\nmeasuring flasks, and the rinsings from these, are all brought\r\ntogether in the same beaker glass. Finally, the amount of solution\r\nNo. 3 required to decompose the excess of oxalic acid is determined.\r\nIf we subtract from the amount thus found the quantity of permanganate\r\nrequired to equalize solutions Nos. 1 and 2 (previously ascertained),\r\nwe shall have the amount of permanganate actually reduced by the\r\nnitric oxide, according to the reaction:\r\n\r\n  6KMnO_{4} + 10NO = 3K_{2}O + 6MnO + 5N_{2}O_{5};\r\n\r\nin other words, on the basis that one molecule of potassium\r\npermanganate will oxidize one and two-thirds molecules of nitric\r\noxide:\r\n\r\n  (KMnO_{4} = 1-2/3 NO).\r\n\r\nThe method of using the apparatus is simple. The nitrate is placed in\r\nB, and the joints made tight, except that at _f_, which is left open.\r\nA current of carbon dioxide is passed through the apparatus until all\r\nof the air has been displaced. Connection is then made at _f_, and\r\nsoon afterward the current of carbon dioxide is shut off at _d_.\r\n\r\nThe flask, B, is now heated as long as may be necessary in order to\r\nproduce, on cooling, the diminished pressure required for the\r\nintroduction of the ferrous chloride and hydrochloric acid. Before\r\nremoving the flame, the joint at _f_ is closed to prevent the return\r\nof the permanganate solution.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the flask, B, has become sufficiently cool, the ferrous\r\nchloride and hydrochloric acid are introduced through the tube, _a_\r\n(which has been full of water from the first), in the same manner and\r\nquantities as in the well-known Tiemann-Schulze method.\r\n\r\nThe pinch cock at _d_ is then opened, and the apparatus allowed to\r\nfill with carbon dioxide. When the pressure has become sufficient to\r\nforce the gas through the solution of permanganate, the pinch cock at\r\n_f_ is removed. It should be opened only slightly and with great\r\ncaution at first, unless one is certain that the pressure is\r\nsufficient. If the pressure is insufficient, the fact will be made\r\napparent by a rise of the permanganate in the small internal tube.\r\n\r\nThe flow of carbon dioxide is now reduced to a very slow current, or\r\nentirely cut off. The contents of B are slowly heated, until the\r\ndecomposition of the nitrate is complete and the greater part of the\r\nnitric oxide has been expelled, when the apparatus is again closed at\r\n_f_ and _d_, and allowed to cool. The tube, _a_, is then washed out,\r\nby the introduction through it into B of a few cubic centimeters of\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe process of filling the apparatus with carbon dioxide, and of\r\nheating the contents of B, is repeated. When it becomes apparent, from\r\nthe light color of the liquid in B, that all of the nitric oxide has\r\nbeen expelled from it, the current of carbon dioxide is increased and\r\nthe heating discontinued. Care must be taken, however, not to admit\r\ntoo strong a current of carbon dioxide, lest some of the nitric oxide\r\nshould be forced unabsorbed through the permanganate solution. It is\r\nalso necessary, for the same reason, to avoid too rapid heating during\r\nthe decomposition of the nitrate.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the nitric oxide has been forced into the solution of\r\npermanganate, the determination is made in the manner already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nTo test the method, nine determinations were made with quantities of\r\npure nitrate of potassium varying from 100 to 200 milligrammes. The\r\nmaximum difference between the volumes of permanganate actually used\r\nand those calculated was 0.05 c.c., while the main difference was\r\n0.036 c.c. The measurements of the permanganate were made from a\r\nburette which had been carefully calibrated. We also made a number of\r\ndeterminations, using a solution of manganous sulphate in the place of\r\nthe oxalic acid. The advantage of this method lies in the fact that it\r\nis not necessary to dissolve the oxide which is precipitated upon the\r\nglass within the tubes, E, E, since, in the presence of an excess of\r\npermanganate, the reduction by nitric oxide extends only to the\r\nformation of MnO_{2}; also in the fact that the solution of manganous\r\nsulphate is more stable than that of oxalic acid. A solution of the\r\nsulphate having been once carefully standardized, can be used for a\r\nlong time to determine the value of permanganate solutions.\r\n\r\nThe details of the method are as follows: A solution of manganous\r\nsulphate slightly stronger than No. 1 is prepared.\r\n\r\nThe difference between 100 c.c. of it and 100 c.c. of No. 1 is\r\nascertained, according to the method of Volhard, by means of solution\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\nThe contents of E, E, together with the rinsings from the tubes, are\r\npoured into a capacious flask. 100 c.c. of the manganous sulphate and\r\na few drops of nitric acid are then added, and the whole boiled.\r\nFinally, the excess of manganous sulphate is determined, in the manner\r\ndescribed by Volhard, by means of solution No. 3. Subtracting from the\r\ntotal amount of permanganate thus used the quantity required to\r\nequalize the 100 c.c. of solution No. 1 and the 100 c.c. of the\r\nmanganous sulphate, we shall have the quantity of permanganate reduced\r\nby the nitric oxide.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that the value of solution No. 3 is\r\nnow to be calculated on the basis of the equation KMnO_{2} + NO =\r\nKNO_{3} + MnO_{2}. One molecule of permanganate equals one molecule of\r\nnitric oxide when manganous sulphate is used, since no part of the\r\npermanganate employed in this method is reduced below the superoxide\r\ncondition. In other words, solution No. 3 now represents only\r\nthree-fifths as much nitric acid as it does when oxalic acid is used.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by this method were moderately satisfactory, but\r\nnot quite so exact as those obtained when oxalic acid was used. A\r\nseries of four determinations gave differences, between the volumes of\r\npermanganate calculated and used, of 0.05 to 0.15 c.c.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to the method lies in the difficulty of\r\ndetermining, in the presence of the brown oxide of manganese, the\r\nexact point at which the oxidation is complete.\r\n\r\nThe carbon dioxide generator, A, was devised by us to take the place\r\nof the ordinary generators, in which marble is used. We have found\r\nthat a submersion of twenty hours in boiling water does not suffice to\r\ncompletely remove the air which, as is well known, is contained in\r\nordinary marble; hence some other substance must be employed as a\r\nsource of the gas. In the apparatus which we are about to describe,\r\nthe acid carbonate of sodium is used.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a long, narrow cylinder (450 x 60 mm.); a tightly\r\nfitting rubber stopper, through which three tubes pass, as shown in\r\nthe figure; a small cylinder, F, containing mercury; and a sulphuric\r\nacid reservoir, G.\r\n\r\nThe tube, _g_, is drawn out to a fine point at the end and curved, so\r\nthat the acid which is delivered into A falls upon and runs down the\r\noutside of the tube. The tube, h, dips under the mercury in F. G and\r\n_g_ are connected by means of a long piece of rubber tubing which is\r\nsupplied with a screw pinch cock.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is made to give any required pressure by raising or\r\nlowering G and F; but the elevation of G, as compared with that of F,\r\nshould always be such that the gas will force its way through h rather\r\nthan g. The upper part of the cylinder, F, is filled with cotton wool\r\nto prevent loss of mercury by spattering.\r\n\r\nThe material placed in A consists of a saturated solution of acid\r\ncarbonate of sodium, to which an excess of the solid salt has been\r\nadded. The sulphuric acid is the ordinary dilute. The apparatus, if\r\nproperly regulated, serves its purpose very well. The principal\r\nprecaution to be observed in using it is to avoid a too sudden\r\nrelieving of the pressure, which would, of course, result in the\r\nintroduction of an unnecessarily large quantity of sulphuric acid into\r\nA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION.\r\n\r\nBy W.W.J. NICOL, M.A., D.Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a hydrated salt is dissolved, does it retain its water of\r\ncrystallization, or does this latter cease to be distinguishable from\r\nthe solvent water? Both views have found advocates among chemists who\r\nhave looked at the question of solution, and both have been supported\r\nby arguments more or less to the point. But among the possible means\r\nof solving this question there is one which has entirely escaped the\r\nnotice of those interested in the subject. And those who hold that\r\nwater of crystallization exists in solution have been entirely\r\noblivious of the fact that, while they are ready to accept the results\r\nof the modern science of thermo-chemistry, and to employ them to\r\nsupport their views on hydration, yet these very results, if correct,\r\nprove without a shadow of a doubt that water of crystallization does\r\nnot exist in solution.\r\n\r\nThe proof is so clear and self-evident when once one's attention is\r\ndirected to it, that, though I intend to develop it more fully on\r\nanother occasion, I feel that it is better to publish an outline of it\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThomsen has found that the heat of neutralization of the soluble bases\r\nof the alkalies and alkaline earths with sulphuric acid has a mean\r\nvalue of 31.150 c. within very narrow limits. When hydrochloric or\r\nnitric acid is employed, the value is 27.640 c., also within very\r\nnarrow limits. Now, this agreement of the six bases in their behavior\r\nwith sulphuric acid, much more of the seven bases with both HNO_{3}\r\nand HCl, is so close that it cannot be regarded as accidental, but, in\r\nthe words of Meyer, the heat of formation of a salt in aqueous\r\nsolution is a quantity made up of two parts, one a constant for the\r\nbase, the other for the acid. But of the twenty salts thus formed,\r\nsome are anhydrous in the solid state, others have water of\r\ncrystallization, up to ten molecules in the case of Na_{2}SO_{4}. If\r\nwater of crystallization exists in solution, it will be necessary to\r\nsuppose that this agreement is accidental, which is absurd, as a\r\nglance at the probabilities will show. Thomsen himself expressly\r\nstates that he regards the dissolved state as one in which the\r\nconditions are comparable for all substances; this would be impossible\r\nif water of crystallization were present.\r\n\r\nA still stronger proof is afforded by the \"_avidity_\" of Thomsen or\r\nthe \"_affinity_\" of Ostwald; both have worked on the subject, taking\r\nno account of water of crystallization, and the results, e.g., for\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} and HCl with NaHO, where water of crystallization _may_\r\ncome in, are entirely confirmed by Ostwald's results on inversion and\r\netherification, where there can be no water of crystallization.\r\n\r\nThe proof is complete, water of crystallization cannot be attached to\r\nthe salt in solution, or if it is, no heat is evolved on union more\r\nthan with solvent water. The alternative is to suppose that the whole\r\nof the above thermo-chemical results are coincidences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPINE FLOWERS IN THE PYRENEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBagneres De Luchon, in the department of the Haute Garonne, is a gay\r\ntown of some 5,000 inhabitants. A friend told me that he once suffered\r\nso much from the heat there in June, that he determined never to go to\r\nthe Pyrenees again. We were there the second week in June, and we\r\nsuffered more from rain and cold, and were very glad of a fire in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nExcept to the south, in the direction of the Porte de Venasque, one of\r\nthe chief mule passes into Spain during summer, where there are fine\r\nsnow-capped mountains, the scenery from the town is not grand, but it\r\nis within easy reach of the wildest parts of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIt is the nearest town to the Maladetta, their highest point, in which\r\nthe Garonne rises, and among whose rocks is one of the last\r\nstrongholds of the ibex or bouquetin, the \"wild goat\" mentioned by\r\nHomer. Eagles and vultures are to be seen sailing about the sky near\r\nLuchon nearly every day, and bears, which in the Pyrenees are neither\r\nmythical nor formidable, descend to within a few miles of the town\r\nafter wild strawberries, which abound there.\r\n\r\nWe heard of two female peasants lately gathering wild strawberries who\r\nwere suddenly confronted with competitors for the spoil in the shape\r\nof a she bear and two cubs. It was doubtful whether man or beast was\r\nthe more surprised. The cubs began to growl, but their dam gave both\r\nof them a box on the ears for their bad manners, and led them away. As\r\nfor flowers, the neighborhood of Luchon has the reputation, perhaps\r\nnot undeserved, of being the most flowery part of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nWe went the usual expeditions from the town, in spite of the weather,\r\nand I will try to remember what plants we noticed in each of them. The\r\nfirst trip was to the Vallee du Lys. In spite of the spelling, the\r\nname suggests lilies of the valley, but we are told that lys is an old\r\nword meaning water, and that the valley took its name from the number\r\nof cataracts, not from lilies, there.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, a lily grows there in great profusion, and was\r\njust coming into flower toward the middle of June. It is the Lis de\r\nSt. Bruno (Anthericum liliastrum), a plant worthy of giving its name\r\nto a valley of which it is a characteristic feature. Still more\r\nconspicuous at the time when we were there were the Narcissus\r\npoeticus, abundant all round Luchon, but already past in the low\r\nmeadows near the town, but higher up, at an elevation of about 4,000\r\nft., it was quite at its best, and whitened the ground over many\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nI looked about for varieties, but failed to detect any special\r\ncharacter by which it could be referred to any of the varietal names\r\ngiven in catalogues, and concluded that it was N. poeticus pure and\r\nsimple. Pulmonarias were abundant along the road, as also in the whole\r\nregion of the Pyrenees, the character of the leaves varying greatly,\r\nsome being spotless, some full of irregular white patches, others with\r\nwell defined round spots. They varied, too, from broad heart-shaped to\r\nnarrow lanceolate, and I soon concluded that it was hopeless to\r\nattempt any division of the class founded upon the leaves.\r\n\r\nBesides the beautiful flowers of Scabious mentioned before, a new\r\nfeature in the meadows here was the abundance of Astrantia major. A\r\npure white Hesperis matronalis was also common, but I saw no purple\r\nforms of it. Geranium phæum also grew everywhere in the fields, the\r\ncolor of the flower varying a good deal. Hepaticas were not so common\r\nby the roadside here as at Eaux Bonnes, but are generally distributed.\r\nMany of them have their leaves beautifully marbled, and I selected and\r\nbrought away a few of the best, in hopes that they may keep this\r\ncharacter. I was struck everywhere by the one-crowned appearance of\r\nthe Hepaticas, as if in their second year from seed.\r\n\r\nOn the mountains, where they were still in flower, I did not find the\r\ncolors mixed, but on one mountain they would be all white, on another\r\nall blue. I do not recollect to have seen any pink. Meconopsis\r\ncambrica is common in the Pyrenees. I observe that in Grenier's\r\n\"French Flora\" the color of the flower is given as \"jaune orange,\" but\r\nI never saw it either in England or in France with orange flowers till\r\nI saw it covering a bank by the side of the road to the Vallee du Lys.\r\nI was too much struck by it to delay securing a plant or two, which\r\nwas lucky, for when we returned every flower had been gathered by some\r\nrival admirers.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition from Luchon is to the Lac d'Oo. This, too, is\r\nfamous for flowers; but especially so is a high valley called Val\r\nd'Esquierry, 2,000 ft. or 3,000 ft. above the village d'Oo, at which\r\nthe carriage road ends. Botanists call this the garden of the\r\nPyrenees, and, of course, I was most anxious to see it.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of our hotel was quite enthusiastic in his description of\r\nthe treat in store for me, enumerating a long catalogue of colors, and\r\nindicating with his hand, palm downward, the height from the ground at\r\nwhich I was to expect to see each color. I was afterward told that he\r\nhad never been to the famous valley, being by no means addicted to\r\nclimbing mountains.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the drive from Luchon we saw hanging from the\r\nrocks by the roadside large masses of Saponaria ocymoides, varying\r\nmuch in the shade of color of the flowers. This is a plant which I\r\nfind it better to grow from cuttings than from seed. The best shades\r\nof color are in this way preserved, and the plants are more flowery\r\nand less straggling. As we got near the end of the carriage road, the\r\nmeadows became more crowded with flowers known in England only in\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nBesides such plants as Geranium pyrenaicum growing everywhere on the\r\nbanks, the fields were full of a light purple geranium--I think\r\nsylvaticum. Here, too, I noticed Meconopsis cambrica with orange\r\nflowers. Narcissus poeticus was also there, and so were some splendid\r\nthistles, large and rich in color. But the most remarkable part of the\r\ncoloring in the meadows was produced by different shades of Viola\r\ncornuta carpeting the ground. We noticed this plant in many parts of\r\nthe Pyrenees, but here especially.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the road I started with a guide for the promised\r\ngarden of the Val d'Esquierry. By the side of the steep and winding\r\npath I noticed Ramondia pyrenaica--the only place I saw it in the\r\nLuchon district. Other notable plants were a quantity of Anemone\r\nalpina of dwarf growth and very large flowers, covering a green knoll\r\nnear a stream. A little beyond, Aster alpinus was in flower, of a\r\nbright color, which I can never get it to show in gardens. These, with\r\nthe exception of a few saxifrages and daffodils of the variety\r\nmuticus, were about the last flowers I saw there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF ALPINE FLOWERS]\r\n\r\nPromise of flowers there was in abundance. Aconites, I suppose\r\nnapellus, and also that form of A. lycoctonum with the large leaves\r\nknown as pyrenaicum, were just enough grown to recognize. The large\r\nwhite Asphodel, called by French botanists A. albus, but better known\r\nin gardens as A. ramosus, which grows everywhere in the Pyrenees, and\r\nthe coarse shoots of Gentiana lutea were just showing.\r\n\r\nFurther on the daffodils were only just putting their noses through\r\nthe yellow dead grass, which the snow had hardly left and was again\r\nbeginning to whiten, for the rain, which had been coming down in\r\ntorrents ever since I left the carriage and had wet me through, had\r\nnow changed to snow. Still I went on, in spite of the bitter cold,\r\nhoping that I should come to some hyperborean region where the flowers\r\nwould be all bright; but my guide at last undeceived me, and convinced\r\nme that we were far too early, so we went down again, wiser and\r\nsadder, and I advise my friends who wish to see the Val d'Esquierry in\r\nits beauty not to visit it before July at the earliest.\r\n\r\nI have still one mountain walk to describe, a far more successful one,\r\nbut it must be deferred till another week.--_C.

A few\r\ndays ago the great plant became tinged with a delicate yellowish-white\r\ncolor, as its 4,000 buds began to develop into the full-blown flowers,\r\nwhose penetrating fragrance, not unlike that of the pond lily, now\r\nattracts swarms of bees and other insects. The plant was purchased in\r\n1837 by the owner, and was then twelve years old. For half a century\r\nthe agave has lain around his greenhouses in company with several\r\nothers, and no special care has been taken of it, except to protect it\r\nsomehow in winter, that it might be fresh for the next summer's\r\ngrowth. The plant has always been a hardy specimen, and required\r\nlittle care. Its whole life, now speedily approaching a termination in\r\nthe fulfillment of the end of its existence--flowering--has been a\r\nsluggish course. Its growth has been steady and its development\r\ngradual. Occasionally it has thrust out a spiked leaf until, in size,\r\nit became greater than its fellow plants and took on the likeness of\r\nan enormous cabbage which had been arrested in its development and\r\nfailed to attain perfection. Early last April its appearance began to\r\nundergo a decided change. Its resemblance to a cabbage lessened, and\r\nit began to look like a giant asparagus plant. On April 12, the great\r\nfleshy leaves, massed together so as to impress the imprint of their\r\nspines upon one another, began to unfold, and a thick, succulent bud\r\nburst up amid the leaves. Slowly the stalk developed from the bud and\r\nassumed gigantic proportions. Green scales appeared in regular\r\narrangement about the stalk, marking the points from which lateral\r\nbranches were to spring. The thick stalk, tender and brittle at first\r\nas new asparagus, became tough and hard enough to resist a knife, and\r\nits surface assumed the gritty character of the leaves of the plant.\r\nThe low roof of the hothouse became an obstruction to further growth,\r\nand had to be removed. Lateral limbs were, at a later period, thrust\r\nout in great numbers, each of them bearing small branches, as do\r\nstrawberry plants, on which hang sprays of buds in bunches of from\r\nthree to ten, making in all many hundreds, all waiting for the\r\ncompletion and blooming of the topmost buds. The inflorescence of the\r\ncentury plant is peculiar, and the appearance of flowers on the lower\r\nbranches may be simultaneous with, or consecutive to, the blossoming\r\non the upper limbs. With the appearance of the lateral outshoots the\r\ngreat aloe lost its likeness to asparagus, and at present bears\r\nresemblance to an immense candelabra. The plant is now fully matured,\r\nand has a height of twenty-seven feet. There are thirty-three branches\r\non the main stem, and, by actual count, one of the lateral limbs was\r\nfound to bear 273 perfect buds, some of whose green sepals have\r\nspread, revealing the yellowish-white petals and essential parts of\r\nthe plant. The ample panicles crowded with curious blossoms are, as,\r\nindeed, the Greek name of the plant--agave--signifies, wonderful.\r\n\r\nThere is a pathetic view to be taken of the great plant's present\r\ncondition. For years it has been preparing to flower, and the shoot it\r\nhas sent up is the dying effort. The blossoms carry in them the life\r\nof new plants, and the old plant dies in giving them birth. It is\r\ncommonly supposed that this plant, the _Agave Americana_, or American\r\naloe, blooms only at the end of 100 years, hence the common name\r\ncentury plant.\r\n\r\nOnly two plants are on record among the floriculturists as having\r\nbloomed in New York State. Thirty years ago, a century plant, of which\r\nthe Casey aloe was a slip, flowered in the greenhouses of the Van\r\nRensselaer family at Albany. In 1869, a second plant blossomed at\r\nRochester. At present, two aloes, one at Albany, the other at\r\nBrooklyn, are reported as giving evidences of approaching maturity.\r\nThey are pronounced not American aloes, or century plants, but _Agave\r\nVirginica_, a plant of the same family commonly found in sterile soil\r\nfrom Virginia to Illinois and south, and blossoming much more\r\nfrequently. In Mexico the century plant is turned to practical account\r\nand made a profitable investment to its owners. After the scape has\r\nreached its full growth it is hewn down, and the sap, which fills the\r\nhollow at its base, is ladled out and converted by fermentation into\r\n\"agave wine,\" or \"pulque,\" the favorite drink of the Mexicans. This\r\npulque, or octli, has an acid resembling that of cider, and a very\r\ndisagreeable odor, but the taste is cooling and refreshing. A brandy\r\ndistilled from pulque is called \"aquardiente,\" or \"mexical.\" The\r\nplant, by tapping, can be made to yield a quart of sap daily. The\r\nfibers of the leaves when dried furnish a coarse thread known as Pita\r\nflax, and when green are used in Mexico as fodder for cattle. Razor\r\nstrops or hones are also made from the leaves, which contain an\r\nabundance of silica and give rise to a very sharp edge on a knife\r\napplied with friction across the surface of the dried leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREOSOTE A SPECIFIC FOR ERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime was when the advocate of a specific was laughed at by the\r\nscientific world, but since it is known that so many forms of disease\r\nare the direct result of some kind of germ life, it is no longer a\r\nmisnomer to call a medicine which will certainly and always destroy\r\nthe germ which produces so many forms of disease a specific.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this definition, founded upon the experience of forty\r\nyears' successful practice in treating this form of disease with\r\ncreosote, the writer is prepared to indorse the heading of this\r\narticle. Having used all the different remedies ordinarily prescribed,\r\nthey have long since been laid aside, and this one used in all forms\r\nof the disease exclusively, and with uniform success.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 it was the writer's fortune to spend several weeks in a\r\nmilitary hospital in Memphis as a volunteer surgeon, under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Lord. In conversation with him, the use of this\r\narticle was mentioned, which appeared new to him, and a case was put\r\nunder treatment with it, with such prompt favorable results as to\r\nelicit his hearty commendation, and, at his suggestion,\r\nSurgeon-General Hammond was informed of it.\r\n\r\nAll injuries, of whatever kind, have been treated with dressings of\r\nthis remedy, and where this has been done from the first to last, in\r\nno instance has there been an attack of erysipelas.\r\n\r\nThe usual manner of application was in solution of six to twenty drops\r\nto the ounce of water, keeping the parts covered with cloths\r\nconstantly wet with it. In ulcers or wounds it may be used in the form\r\nof a poultice, by stirring ground elm into the solution, the strength\r\nto be regulated according to the virulence of the attack. Ordinarily,\r\nten drops to the ounce is strong enough for the cutaneous form of the\r\ndisease and in dressings for wounds or recent injuries. If the\r\ninflammation threatens to spread rapidly, it should be increased to\r\ntwenty or more drops to the ounce of water.\r\n\r\nThe antiseptic properties of this remedy render it of additional\r\nvalue, as it will certainly destroy the tendency to unhealthy\r\nsuppuration, and thus prevent septicæmia.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of hundreds of cases of erysipelas but one fatal case\r\nhas occurred, and that one in an old and depraved system. In the less\r\nviolent attacks no other remedy was used, but where constitutional\r\ntreatment was indicated, the usual appropriate tonics were prescribed.\r\n\r\nThere is no question in my mind but that creosote is as much a\r\nspecific in erysipelas as quinine is in intermittent fever, and may be\r\nused with as much confidence.--_St. Louis Med. Jour._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF CARDIAC DRUGS.\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM GILMAN THOMPSON, M.D., New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus was devised by Mr. R.D. Gray (the inventor of the\r\ningenious \"vest camera\" and other photographic improvements) and by\r\nmyself. I described what was required and suggested various\r\nmodifications and improvements, but the mechanical details were worked\r\nout exclusively by him. To test the rapidity of the camera, we\r\nphotographed a \"horse-timer\" clock, with a dial marking quarter\r\nseconds, and succeeded in taking five distinct photographs in half a\r\nsecond with _one_ lens, which has never before been accomplished\r\nexcepting by Professor Marey,[1] at the College de France, who has\r\ntaken successive views of flying birds, falling balls, etc., with one\r\nlens at a very rapid rate. His camera was unknown to me until after\r\nmine was constructed, so that as a success in photography alone the\r\nwork is interesting.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: La Methode Graphique (Supplement), Paris, 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe camera consists of a circular brass box, 5½ inches in diameter and\r\n1¼ inches deep, containing a circular vulcanite shutter with two\r\napertures, behind which is placed a circular dry plate. Both plate and\r\nshutter are revolved in opposite directions to each other by a simple\r\narrangement of four cogged wheels moved by a single crank. The box is\r\nperforated at one side by a circular opening, 1¾ inches in diameter,\r\nfrom the margin of which projects at a right angle a long brass tube\r\n(Fig. 1), which carries the lens. In Fig. 2 the lid of the box has\r\nbeen removed, and the bottom of the box, with the wheels, springs, and\r\npartially closed shutter, is presented. The lid is double--that is, it\r\nis a flat box in itself. It contains nothing but the dry plate,\r\nsupported at its center upon a small brass disk, against which disk it\r\nis firmly pressed by a pivot attached to a spring fastened in the lid.\r\nThe aperture in one side of this double lid, which corresponds with\r\nthat seen in the floor of the box, may be closed by a slide, so that\r\nthe lid containing the plate can be removed like an ordinary plate\r\nholder and carried to a dark room, where it is opened and the plate is\r\nchanged. When the lid is replaced this slide is removed, and as the\r\nshutter is made to revolve, the light falls upon whatever portion of\r\nthe dry plate happens to be opposite the opening.\r\n\r\nBy reference to Fig. 2, it will be seen that when the large wheel\r\nwhich projects outside of the box is revolved by a crank, it turns the\r\nsmall ratchet wheel, which bears an eccentric pawl. (The crank has\r\nbeen removed in Fig. 2; it is seen in Fig. 1.) The central wheel has\r\nonly six cogs. The pawl is pressed into one of these cogs by a spring.\r\nIt pushes the central wheel around one-sixth of its circumference,\r\nwhen it returns to be pressed into the next cog. While the pawl\r\nreturns, it necessarily leaves the central wheel at rest, and whatever\r\nmomentum this wheel carries is checked by a simple stop pressed by a\r\nspring upon the opposite side. The central wheel carries a square\r\naxle, which projects through a small hole in the center of the double\r\nlid and fits into the brass disk before alluded to, causing the disk\r\nto revolve with the axle. The disk is covered by rubber cloth; and as\r\nthe dry plate is pressed firmly against the rubber surface by the\r\nspring in the lid, the plate adheres to the rubber and revolves with\r\nthe disk. Thus every complete revolution of the central wheel in the\r\nfloor of the box carries with it the dry plate, stops it, and moves it\r\non again six times. The velocity of revolution of the plate is only\r\nlimited by the rapidity with which one can turn the crank.\r\n\r\nThe shutter is revolved in the opposite direction by a wheel whose\r\ncogs are seen fitting into those of the little wheel carrying the\r\neccentric pawl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE CAMERA MOUNTED.]\r\n\r\nThe two apertures in the shutter are so placed that at the instant of\r\nexposure of the plate it is momentarily at rest, while the plate when\r\nmoving is covered by the shutters. This arrangement prevents vibration\r\nof the plate and blurring of the image. The camera is mounted by two\r\nlateral axles with screw clamps upon two iron stands, such as are in\r\ncommon use in chemical laboratories. A brass rod attached to the tube\r\nsteadies it, and allows it to be screwed fast at any angle\r\ncorresponding to the angle at which the heart is placed. It is thus\r\neasy to put a manometer tube in the femoral artery of an animal, bend\r\nit up alongside of the exposed heart, and simultaneously photograph\r\nthe cardiac contraction and the degree of rise of the fluid in the\r\nmanometer(!). The tube is arranged like the draw tube of a microscope.\r\nIt is made long, so as to admit of taking small hearts at life-size.\r\nThe stand carries a support for the frog or other animal to be\r\nexperimented upon, and a bottle of physiological salt solution kept\r\nwarm by a spirit lamp beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--INTERIOR OF THE CAMERA.]\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus is readily packed in a small space. I have already\r\ntaken a number of photographs of various hearts and intestines with\r\nit, and the contraction of the heart of the frog produced by\r\n_Strophanthus hispidus_, the new cardiac stimulant, is seen in Fig. 3,\r\ntaken by this new instrument. The apparatus has the great advantage\r\nthat six photographs of a single cardiac pulsation, or of any muscular\r\ncontraction, may be easily taken in less than one second, or, by\r\nsimply turning the crank slower, they may be taken at any desired rate\r\nto keep pace with the rhythm of the heart. The second hand of a watch\r\nmay be placed in the field of view and simultaneously photographed\r\nwith the heart, so that there can be no question about the series of\r\nphotographs all belonging to one pulsation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE HEART IN MOTION.\r\n\r\n1, Normal diastole; 2, auricular systole; 3, ventricular systole. 1,\r\n2, 3 were taken in a half second; 4, 5, 6, same as 1, 2, 3, after\r\ninjection of toxic dose of Strophanthus hispidus. 4, 5, 6 were taken\r\nin a half second. The pulse rate was 74.]\r\n\r\nI have already called attention[13] to the ease with which these\r\nphotographs are enlarged for lecture room demonstration, either on\r\npaper or in a stereopticon, and the ease with which they may be\r\nreproduced in print to illustrate the action of drugs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Medical Record_, loc. cit.; Recent Advances in Methods\r\nof Studying the Heart, _Medical Press_, Buffalo, March 1, 1886, p.\r\n234; Instantaneous Photographs of the Heart, Johns Hopkins University\r\nCirculars, March, 1886, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA CATALOGUE containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTerms of Subscription, $5 a year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the\r\nUnited States or Canada.
