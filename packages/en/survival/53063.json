BAKER & SON\r\n\r\n  LONDON\r\n\r\n  SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, HAMILTON, KENT & CO.\r\n  1907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objects of this work are twofold: to describe the actual incidents\r\nof various interesting episodes in the modern sport of cave exploring,\r\nand to give an account of the scientific results of underground\r\ninvestigations in the Mendip region of Somerset. Speleology is the\r\nlatest of the sporting sciences: like orology and Arctic exploration,\r\nit has two sides, sport and adventure being the lure to some, whilst\r\nothers are chiefly attracted by the new light thrown by these\r\nresearches on the geology, the hydrology, and the natural history\r\nof the subterranean regions explored. The chapters dealing with the\r\nscientific results are by H. E. Balch, who has been working on the\r\ngeology of Mendip, more especially among the caves, for upwards of\r\ntwenty years: the accounts of actual experiences, in which the sporting\r\nside is predominant, are by E. A. Baker, who described the recent\r\nexploration of the Derbyshire caves in his _Moors, Crags, and Caves\r\nof the High Peak_, 1903. No attempt is made to traverse the ground so\r\nperfectly covered by Professor Boyd Dawkins in his fascinating volume\r\non _Cave Hunting_, and elsewhere, most of the work described here being\r\nsupplementary to that done by him, and, largely, outside the scope of\r\nhis aims.

BAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NETHERWORLD OF MENDIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE DISTRICT OF THE MENDIPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A land of caves, whose palaces of fantastic beauty still adorn the\r\nmysterious underworld where murmuring rivers first see the light.\" In\r\nthese words an imaginative writer describes Somerset, which shares with\r\nDerbyshire and Yorkshire the title of a land of caverns. Across it the\r\nrange of the Mendips, a region of Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, 1000 feet above tide-level, stretches in a huge, flat-topped\r\nrampart for nearly 30 miles, from the town of Frome to the sea. No\r\npiece of country in the kingdom offers so much to explore. An abundant\r\nharvest is there waiting to be reaped; for on every side are obvious\r\nindications of half-buried gateways to the dark and secret pathways\r\nto the netherworld, and everywhere upon the surface of the Mendip\r\ntableland lie the open pits and hollows which the local speech calls\r\n\"swallets,\" that is to say, swallow holes, some of them dry, some\r\nactively engulfing streams, but all testifying to untold ages of water\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThis Limestone district lies far from the busy hives of industry,\r\nremote and secluded in the very heart of lovely Somerset. Only on the\r\ndarkest of nights, with the clouds low in the sky, can the glare of the\r\nlights of Bristol be seen reflected far to the northward. One main\r\nline of railway, the Great Western from Bristol to Exeter, passes near\r\nit, and even that does not intrude beyond the margin of this Caveland.\r\nThe rendezvous for the cave explorers of the district is usually the\r\nquiet little city of Wells, lying calm and secluded under the southern\r\nslopes of Mendip, in close proximity to all the principal caverns. A\r\nmile to the south-east rises the bold and picturesque Dulcote Hill,\r\na fragment of the most southerly anticline of Mountain Limestone in\r\nthe kingdom. From this point, rolling northward in a great fivefold\r\nanticline, Old Red Sandstone, Lower Limestone Shales, and Mountain\r\nLimestone form the great mass of the worn-down stump of the once mighty\r\nMendip range. The extent of the denudation which has taken place\r\nindicates that this range was originally at least 5000 feet high,\r\nyet now in but a few places is the height of 1000 feet attained, and\r\nthis is reached only by the Old Red Sandstone ridges laid bare in the\r\nprolonged course of that denudation. The first of these high ridges\r\nrises boldly to the north of Wells, and a steep climb of 900 feet in\r\ntwo and a half miles brings us to the summit of Pen Hill, or Rookham,\r\nfrom which a grand southward view is to be obtained. Immediately below,\r\nthe three cathedral towers pierce the blue mist hanging over the little\r\ncity we have just left. Beyond, the peat moors of the Brue and the Axe\r\nstretch away to the Isle of Avalon, sacred as the birthplace of our\r\nChristian faith in England. Here below us is that\r\n\r\n              \"Island valley of Avilion,\r\n  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\r\n  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies\r\n  Deep meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns,\r\n  And bowery hollows crowned with summer seas.\"\r\n\r\nHere, where Arthur's bones are said to have been found, and where\r\ntraditions associated with him abound, his memory is kept green in\r\nthe names of many well-known spots; and yonder rises Cadbury Camp,\r\nlooked upon by many as the Camelot of romance. On the low ridge which\r\nintervenes between the valleys of the Axe and the Brue lies Wedmore,\r\nwhere King Alfred gained in the Peace of Wedmore such temporary\r\nrespite from his foes as allowed him to gather strength for the great\r\noperations that resulted at last in the conquest and unity of the\r\nwhole kingdom. Yonder, too, are the marshes of the Parrett and the\r\nTone, around which cluster tales familiar to every schoolchild. In the\r\nmarshes between the Mendips and Glastonbury, exploration has unearthed\r\na most interesting example of a swamp or lake village, with great\r\nstore of antiquarian material, throwing a flood of light upon a period\r\nof which little was known. Beyond lies Sedgemoor, where in 1685 took\r\nplace the last battle ever fought on English soil; and throughout this\r\nneighbourhood the infamous Jeffreys worked his will in the judicial\r\nslaughter of countless Somerset men.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance the sunshine glints on the waters of the Bristol\r\nChannel, where, 60 miles away, the bold promontory of the Foreland\r\nrises sheer from the sea; to the south, upon the farthest limits of our\r\nvision, Pilsdon and Lewsdon mark the descent of our southern counties\r\nto the English Channel; whilst, on a clear day, between them is seen\r\nthe summit of Golden Cap, the base of which is washed by our southern\r\nsea. Surely here is as fair a scene as eye could wish to see.\r\n\r\nOnly a pleasant walk away, the great chasms of Ebbor and Cheddar\r\nhave rent the rocks asunder, forming two of the loveliest ravines in\r\nthe kingdom. Northward across the intervening syncline of Mountain\r\nLimestone, pitted with swallets marking the entrances to many an\r\nunknown subterranean labyrinth, are seen the Old Red Sandstone summits\r\nof North Hill, crowned with its seventeen Neolithic barrows, and of\r\nBlackdown beyond, from whose bare top is seen the broad estuary of the\r\nSevern spreading out across the view, giving a glimpse of the coast\r\nof South Wales in the far distance, its busy factories showing their\r\npencil-like chimneys against the dark hills behind. In the Channel the\r\nlittle islands of Steepholm and Flatholm mark the line of the original\r\ncontinuation of the great Mendip range into South Wales. The limestone\r\nshores of the former rise sheer from the sea, forming an impregnable\r\nfortress. Here, far below the level of the salt water around, a supply\r\nof pure water is obtained from the Limestone, brought, doubtless, from\r\nthe Limestone area of Mendip by way of some hidden fissure.\r\n\r\nHard by, at Clevedon, is the grave of that great friend of Tennyson,\r\nwho sat here and listened to\r\n\r\n  \"The moaning of the homeless sea,\r\n   The sound of streams that, swift or slow,\r\n   Draw down æonian hills, and sow\r\n   The dust of continents to be.\"\r\n\r\nVery truly and accurately his words describe the action that is going\r\non, by which the swallet streams are undermining and honeycombing these\r\nhills and bearing their component rocks away to the sea.\r\n\r\nStanding on Pen Hill and looking northward, a great east and west\r\ndepression is seen forming a broad low valley in the tableland of\r\nMendip. Into this valley numerous springs and a liberal rainfall are\r\nfor ever pouring their waters. Yet nowhere is there a surface channel\r\nwhich can carry this water away; and nowhere, save in the small hollows\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone and Shales, does water accumulate. The reason\r\nis not far to seek. The Carboniferous Limestone, evenly stratified\r\neverywhere, has been split by vertical joints into a series of gigantic\r\ncubes. Between them, the surface waters, laden with carbonic acid\r\nobtained from the atmosphere and from vegetation, have for ages made\r\ntheir way, enlarging them by both chemical and mechanical action, till\r\nthey have become fissures capable of giving passage to an enormous\r\nquantity of water. So from one joint to another, from one bedding plane\r\nto another, the water percolates downwards until it meets with some\r\nimpermeable rock beneath, or until it finds an outlet at the level of\r\nthe Secondary rocks forming the valley below. Such impermeable beds\r\nare found in the Lower Limestone Shales, and the resulting outlets are\r\nwell known in the great risings of St. Andrew's Well in the gardens of\r\nthe Bishop's Palace at Wells, in the source of the Axe at Wookey Hole,\r\nin the Cheddar Water and other large springs, of all of which more\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE MENDIP DISTRICT OF SOMERSET, SHOWING\r\nSWALLETS, CAVES, AND OUTLETS.]\r\n\r\nReference to the sketch map of the district will show that the majority\r\nof the more important swallets lie along the line of the great\r\ndepression referred to. These comprise by no means all the swallets\r\nof Mendip, yet they are the chief ones. It is obvious that the whole\r\nof the mass of material represented by this great depression has been\r\nremoved in suspension by way of these swallets; and one is compelled to\r\nask, How long has this work been going on? What time is represented by\r\nso vast a work? On the threshold of the inquiry we are met by such an\r\namount of evidence bearing upon it that the subject must be dealt with\r\nseparately. For, upon the upturned edges of the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nrocks, which can have been brought down to their present plane of\r\ndenudation only by long-continued water action, have been deposited,\r\nand still remain _in situ_, great masses of the basement beds of the\r\nSecondary rocks, lying in such a manner as to convince us that swallet\r\naction had prepared the denuded surfaces upon which they lie. And upon\r\nthis hinges the whole question of the antiquity of the caverns of\r\nMendip. But whilst the age of our caverns is a debatable matter, no\r\none can question the accuracy of the theory of ravine formation from\r\nthe collapse of cavern roofs, as evidenced by the instances supplied by\r\nMendip.\r\n\r\nThrough crevices and cracks, here, there, and everywhere, the\r\npercolating waters find their way. Now some crevice is enlarged into\r\na passage; now some weak point in the passage becomes a chamber; and\r\non the water rushes, steadily joining forces and accumulating, until\r\non the level of the lower land it finds an outlet, and rushes forth\r\na considerable stream. In its headlong course the water again and\r\nagain leaps down some great series of potholes, as down some giant\r\nstairway, forming many fine cascades, whose deafening roar goes on for\r\never where there is no ear to hear and where no footstep ever treads\r\nthe rocky ways. Along the course of the larger streams huge chambers\r\noccur; for the ever-eddying water, bearing sand along in its course,\r\neats out the sides of its channel, or, revolving stones in its bed,\r\ncarves out the pothole by friction. Or some pendent mass of rock has\r\nits support undermined and comes crashing into the streamway, only to\r\nbe broken up and carried away by the ceaseless energy of the stream,\r\nso ever enlarging the chambers upwards towards the light of day. But\r\nwhilst this action is going on underground, a more potent factor is\r\nat work where the subterranean stream first sees the light. Here\r\nvery soon the action of the water alone gives rise to a little cliff\r\noverhead. Now rain and frost, wind and tempest, loosen, bit by bit,\r\nthe fragments of rock forming the face of the cliff, which fall away\r\ninto the river, to be broken up and carried away. Little by little the\r\nface of the cliff recedes, along the line of the subterranean river,\r\nuntil the first underground chamber is reached. The undermined archway\r\nof rock is less able to withstand the agents of denudation, and the\r\ncliff front recedes apace. Such is the present stage at Wookey Hole,\r\nthe chamber whence the river Axe issues being still in process of\r\ndestruction. Thus the work goes on slowly, yet none the less surely,\r\nuntil along the whole course of the subterranean river the roof of\r\nthe cavern is destroyed, perhaps effectually hiding the stream under\r\nhuge blocks of Limestone, such as those of Ebbor Gorge, near Wells,\r\nor until the water finds another course for itself, as at Cheddar, to\r\nbegin the whole story over again. Every stage is abundantly illustrated\r\nby our Mendip swallets and caves. The large swallets of Eastwater,\r\nthree and a half miles from Wells, of Swildon's or Swithin's Hole, a\r\nhalf-mile nearer Priddy, and the more recent swallet of Stoke Lane,\r\nhalf-way between Wells and Frome, are excellent examples of streams\r\nengulfed on the summit of Mendip. The whole of the country surrounding\r\nthe two first-named caverns is dotted with innumerable small pits and\r\nhollows. The great swallet of Hillgrove, three miles north of Wells,\r\nin the exploration of which we are at present engaged, in an endeavour\r\nto penetrate the labyrinth of ways to which it will undoubtedly\r\nafford access, is a fine example of an intermittent swallet. Here\r\nthree ways, carved deeply through the stream-borne sands and clays of\r\nsome uncertain epoch of geological history, converge in a deep glen,\r\nbeautiful with its tropical wealth of ferns. In the bottom of the glen\r\nhuge spurs of Limestone stand up boldly, dipping towards the Old Red\r\nSandstone exposed to the south, and pointing to a great fault, along\r\nthe line of which the Limestone water is bound to accumulate in a\r\nhuge triangular reservoir, the outflow from which may account for the\r\nsummer flow of the Axe when the majority of the swallets are dry. In\r\nwinter the converging torrents here find ingress into the Limestone,\r\nbut, though pits and hollows abound on every hand, no foot of man has\r\never yet trod the hidden ways beneath. At a depth of 10 feet we have\r\nreached the first open channel, only to have it blocked subsequently by\r\na fall of the treacherous gravel through which we have been working.\r\n\r\nVast dry swallets are represented by a great depression which we call\r\nthe Bishop's Lot Swallet, on the road from Wells to Priddy. Here a huge\r\nhollow in the ground, perfectly circular and 300 yards round, shows\r\nus the largest swallet in Mendip. Though the surrounding land slopes\r\ngently to the edge of the great pit, which is 60 feet in depth, there\r\nis but the smallest trace of water penetrating it. It is ages since the\r\ndrainage of the surrounding land gravitated towards it, for it lies at\r\na considerable height above the level of most of the other swallets\r\nin the neighbourhood. A mile and a half to the west, a similar pit\r\noccurs called Sand Pit Hole. Here too water has ceased to flow, and it\r\nremains, with precipitous sides, a problem for us to investigate in the\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\nTo enter either of the active swallets of Eastwater or Swildon's Hole,\r\nand to follow it to its greatest depth, is to gain an insight into\r\nthe action of subterranean streams such as no other method can give.\r\nThe former is well illustrated by the annexed section, in which its\r\nprofound depth and its labyrinth of passages may readily be understood.\r\nThe difficulties and disappointments which we encountered when I\r\nconducted the operations which at last resulted in our effecting\r\nan entrance into this cavern, the existence of which was not even\r\nsuspected previously, need not here be recapitulated. Altogether, what\r\nwith volunteers and labourers, nearly a dozen of us were occupied ten\r\ndays in the determined effort which we made, and which at last was\r\ncrowned with success. From the point of view of the subsequent explorer\r\nthe reader is referred to the ensuing chapter upon Eastwater Cavern,\r\nwhich will convey some idea of what the first explorers must undergo in\r\nany such place when to the ordinary difficulties of such an exploration\r\nis added the great uncertainty felt at every step taken, and when\r\nevery boulder upon which our weight is to rest must first be carefully\r\nexamined. The difficulty of our work at Eastwater is practically what\r\nmust be experienced in any new work undertaken in the Mendip region,\r\nand there is much waiting to be done. If there is one thing more than\r\nanother to be learned from Eastwater Cavern, it is the great importance\r\nof chokes in determining the lines of subterranean drainage. Here they\r\nare seen in every stage of formation and destruction, and the channels\r\nwhich have been carved by the arrested water may be readily recognised.\r\n\r\nThere is a fascination in exploration work such as that at Eastwater,\r\nwhere corridors, hitherto untrodden by the foot of man, open up all\r\naround as you make your way ever downwards into the heart of the hills;\r\nand even now there are many accessible passages into which as yet no\r\none has penetrated. Reference to the section annexed will show an upper\r\nway, which terminates abruptly in a choke of stones and gravel, holding\r\nup a little water, whilst allowing a considerable quantity to pass. It\r\nis a remarkable fact that in all the labyrinths of galleries which we\r\nhave explored in the profound depths of this cavern we have not yet\r\nalighted upon any portion which gives access to the continuation of\r\nthis channel. There, rendered inaccessible by the barrier of débris,\r\nis, without doubt, a cavern as extensive as that which we have proved\r\nto exist in the sister watercourse hard by; and these two channels,\r\nstarting from practically the same point, must diverge widely, and\r\ncertainly do not unite again before the depth of 500 feet is attained.\r\n\r\nFarther eastward in Mendip, too, are similar swallet caverns. Not far\r\nto the north-west of Stoke Lane is an interesting cavern locally known\r\nas Cox's Hole. It is situated in the Limestone forming the southern\r\nedge of the great basin in which lies the Radstock Coalfield. Owing to\r\nthe existence of this coalfield, there are no deep caves accessible in\r\nthis part of Mendip. Yet a good deal of water must be absorbed through\r\nthe innumerable fissures into the depths of the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nunderlying the coalfield, and it is by no means unlikely that this\r\nwater, heated to a high point by the subterranean temperature, gives\r\nrise to the hot springs at Bath. Cox's Hole was at a remote period,\r\nwhen the form of the hill was very different from that presented now,\r\nan active water-channel, evidently draining towards St. Dunstan's Well.\r\nIt has two distinct entrances, one, the more westerly, being a cavity\r\nof considerable size. For about 100 feet the cavern consists of a roomy\r\ngallery running more or less horizontally. Then it pinches in, until\r\nthe height is less than a foot, and only those can get along who are\r\nable to compress themselves into small compass. In a few feet, however,\r\nit widens out into a good-sized passage, with fine stalactites here and\r\nthere, especially at a point on the northern side where an aven opens\r\ninto a chamber more than 30 feet high. Now roomy and now contracted,\r\nthe passage leads on until, at a distance of 100 yards from the\r\nentrance, it becomes so small that there is considerable difficulty in\r\nproceeding. Beyond this point the cavern becomes a simple water-tunnel,\r\nof a type common in Yorkshire. At 130 yards there is a sharp descent,\r\nthe floor is littered with boulders, and 20 yards farther the passage\r\nis choked with silt. A very small passage, which had water in it when\r\nI was there, is said to be passable at times, though I am inclined to\r\ndoubt this. An almost vertical ascent amongst treacherous boulders,\r\nhowever, seems an indication of a possible route onwards, which may,\r\nI trust, with care be yet explored. The last 50 yards of the cave run\r\nto the south-east--that is, away from the direction of St. Dunstan's\r\nWell--a beautiful spring rising from the Carboniferous Limestone hard\r\nby; yet I feel sure that it must of necessity be a part of the same\r\nwaterway. Either it was an inlet which received the waters of some\r\nvanished Old Red Sandstone spring, or it was a former outlet for the\r\nwaters of that well. I am inclined to favour the former theory. As to\r\nthe present source of the waters of St. Dunstan's Well there can be\r\nno doubt whatever. In the valley below Stoke Lane, and three-quarters\r\nof a mile distant from the well and from Cox's Hole, there is a most\r\ninteresting swallet, of comparatively recent age. It is obviously\r\ncertain that, not so long ago, the stream which courses down the\r\nvalley flowed unchecked down its whole length, and so reached the\r\nlarger stream below. Slightly retarded, in all probability, by some\r\nflood-borne silt, the water found a little joint in the western bank of\r\nthe valley, and by slow degrees so enlarged it that it at last became\r\ncapable of swallowing the whole. Even now a few hours' work would\r\ndivert the water and cause it to resume its former course. Upstream is\r\na mill, the owner of which has courteously given every facility for\r\ntesting and for exploration. It was found that the effect of damming\r\nthe mill stream entirely was to reduce the flow at St. Dunstan's Well\r\nenormously, and to render the entrance of the swallet passable. Mr.\r\nMarshall of Stratton-on-the-Fosse with his party made a successful\r\ndescent, and travelled a considerable distance, mainly parallel\r\nwith the valley without and to a great extent horizontally, through\r\nwater-tunnels of small size. As no measurements were taken one cannot\r\nsay yet how far it is passable, but he says that they did not get to\r\nthe limits of possible exploration, as the time which they spent there\r\nwas getting dangerously near the hour up to which it is possible to\r\ndam the water, and they most wisely beat a hasty retreat. The first\r\nopportunity will be taken by us to make use of a spell of fine weather\r\nto carry this exploration to a successful issue. Not far distant,\r\ntoo, is another swallet, from which the water has been diverted to be\r\nused for water-supply. This is in the vicinity of a ruined hunting\r\nlodge, and is said to lead in the same direction as the Stoke Lane\r\nSwallet. The whole of this district is likely to be very interesting,\r\nthere being a series of remarkable rifts or fissures in the Dolomitic\r\nConglomerate which deserve attention. One of these, called Fairy Slats,\r\nhas been known for many years, and is indeed shown on the Ordnance\r\nmap; and the fact that such fissures abound has been forcibly brought\r\nhome by a disaster to a new reservoir, only recently completed by the\r\nauthorities of Downside Monastery, to supply the neighbouring villages.\r\nHere a finely designed basin, having been constructed over one of these\r\nfissures, had its massive concrete bottom burst out as if it were an\r\negg-shell the moment the water filled it, and in a single hour the\r\nwhole fabric was absolutely ruined. Some measure of the extent of the\r\nconcealed fissures may be gathered from the fact that 500,000 gallons\r\nof water were absolutely swallowed up without a drop coming to light\r\nin the neighbouring valley. An early visitor to the adjoining field\r\nreported that air was being ejected through the grass all around him,\r\nmuch to his alarm, as he was quite unaware of what had occurred. It\r\nwill be a most interesting subject for inquiry, as to how far such\r\nfissures as these are the results of water action or otherwise, and\r\nit is most desirable to descend one of them at the first opportunity\r\nin search of evidence. At present I am inclined to attribute their\r\npresence to movements in the Secondary rocks, due to the intersection\r\nof the district by valleys. The Conglomerate mass has parted along the\r\nlines of the principal joints, and the rifts thus formed have become\r\nlines of drainage. This theory, in view of possible future discoveries,\r\nmay have to be modified.\r\n\r\nAbove Stoke Lane Swallet, and evidently connected with it in some\r\nremote way, is a cavity without a name, the exploration of which would\r\nprobably be interesting, and would be most likely to yield remains of\r\nprimitive Man. Mr. Marshall also reports the existence of a fissure\r\nof considerable size, where, after a very small entrance, a point\r\nis reached with a vertical descent of great depth. All these things\r\nindicate that there is a splendid field here for further work.\r\n\r\nIndeed there are abundant evidences of this all over Mendip. One of\r\nthe most interesting problems has had further light thrown upon it\r\nby work recently done by us at Wookey Hole. The Hyæna Den and the\r\nBadger Hole are testimony that a large amount of underground action\r\nhas taken place upon the east side of the ravine, yet nothing has been\r\nknown hitherto of any series of dry channels upon that side. Recently,\r\nhowever, we have succeeded in gaining access, by way of the smallest of\r\nfissures, into what will turn out most likely to be a portion of this\r\nvery series. Here is to be seen a choked-up chamber of precisely the\r\nsame type as the Hyæna Den, but far deeper in the wall of the ravine.\r\nWithout doubt it contains prehistoric remains, yet its excavation will\r\nentail great labour. We have already reached a distance of 80 feet from\r\nthe entrance, and only a partially choked passage bars the way.\r\n\r\nHigh up in the ravine at Ebbor, too, there is a very promising field\r\nfor further research. This is immediately beneath a cliff on the\r\nwestern side of the valley, where we have already done much preliminary\r\nwork. There is also a very promising little cave, slightly north of\r\nTower Rock in the same gorge and high up in its side. Here a narrow\r\nentrance gives access to a small chamber, on the floor of which is a\r\ndeep deposit of cave earth, from which I have obtained Deer bones.\r\n\r\nAt Dulcote, again, there is a series of waterways and dry caves of\r\ngreat interest, which in themselves bear corroborative evidence of the\r\ngreat antiquity of the caverns of the district. From time to time the\r\nquarrymen have broken in upon these waterways, which have been lost in\r\nsubsequent operations. Not many years ago a blast blew off the top of\r\nan almost vertical shaft, carved out in the Limestone by water action\r\nand descending to a great depth. The mass of rock blown off by the\r\ncharge turned over and fell down the shaft, blocking it at 30 feet from\r\nthe surface. It was possible to descend to this point and throw down\r\nstones, which fell for a considerable distance; but the block was never\r\nmoved, and in the process of quarrying the hole became filled, and is\r\nnow lost in the general level of the quarry. Hard by, also, a cavern of\r\nconsiderable extent was opened, and still remains. It contains nothing\r\nof peculiar interest, though when I was first lowered into it, from\r\na hole 60 feet above its floor, it contained very pretty coral-like\r\nsplash stalagmite; and also, in the mud floor, the tubular linings\r\nof calcite, formed from the drip from above. In this quarry, too,\r\nwere found a considerable quantity of the bones of Bear, Deer, Bos,\r\nHorse, etc., and these are now in the Wells Museum, where they were\r\ndeposited some years since by A. F. Somerville, Esq. There are numerous\r\nother minor caves in this locality. Farther up the same valley, above\r\nCroscombe, is a small cave known locally as Betsy Camel's Hole, and it\r\nappears to have been occupied by a woman bearing that name for some\r\nyears. She was, of course, carried away by the devil, according to the\r\nsame popular report. It may very well have been a rock shelter at some\r\nstage of its history. Mr. Somerville informs me, too, that in Dinder\r\nWood there is a small cave which was almost certainly a rock shelter.\r\nThis also has never been explored. In fact, the whole district may\r\nbe described as an unexplored field, and there is abundant room for\r\nwilling helpers. The landowners, for the most part, are exceedingly\r\nkind and ready to offer every facility for scientific research.\r\n\r\n     H. E. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEDDAR GROUP OF CAVERNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great gorge of Cheddar and its caverns form a subject of surpassing\r\ninterest to the student of Geology. Presenting some of the most\r\nstupendous cliff scenery in England, the great wall of rock on the\r\nsouthern side of the valley towers nearly 500 feet into the air,\r\ndefying all attempts at mapping contour lines; and the road which\r\ntraverses the ravine winds, with many a sudden turn, along the base of\r\nthis noble cliff, ever upwards, until in four miles the actual summit\r\nof the Mendip downs is reached. At the entrance to the gorge, and\r\nclose to the caverns owned by Gough, the hidden river bursts into the\r\nlight, pouring forth a stream of great volume, which, after serving\r\nthe purposes of various millers in the village, hurries on to join its\r\nsister stream from Wookey Hole, the two then flowing into the sea near\r\nWeston-super-Mare. It is strange that in all the exploration work that\r\nhas been done at Cheddar, the underground channel of the stream has not\r\nonce been reached. Near the entrance in Gough's Cave a fairly deep hole\r\ncontains water, which changes in level along with the river itself, but\r\nno open passage leads from it. A vertical rope descent of 100 feet from\r\nthe upper and practically unknown caverns belonging to Gough brings the\r\nexplorer to what must be regarded as the nearest point which has yet\r\nbeen reached to the subterranean river of Cheddar. As this gorge is\r\nthe most stupendous in the Mendip region, so is this stream the most\r\nconsiderable in volume. Mr. Sheldon of Wells has gauged its minimum\r\nflow to be not less than three million gallons per day, whilst its\r\ntorrent at flood time must be many times as much, probably not less\r\nthan eight or ten millions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT GORGE OF CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Dawkes & Partridge, Wells._]\r\n\r\nThis is considerably larger than the other two great outlets of the\r\nsubterranean waters of Mendip, those of Wookey Hole and Wells, each of\r\nwhich, however, pours forth an enormous volume. That it is the Cheddar\r\nstream which is responsible for the existence of the gorge itself no\r\none can doubt, and it is a most interesting subject for discussion as\r\nto how this has been brought about. It is not difficult to determine\r\nwhat points must mark the boundaries of the catchment area, the waters\r\nof which drain to Cheddar. The road from Castle Comfort to Charterhouse\r\non the north-east, the outcrop of Shales south of Blackdown on the\r\nnorth, and a line drawn from Rowberrow Farm north of Priddy to the\r\ngorge itself on the south, enclose the whole area from which the supply\r\nis obtained. This is somewhere about 12 square miles in extent. To this\r\nmust be added, possibly, some water from slightly more to the eastward.\r\nIt is now the commonly accepted theory that the whole of this water,\r\nor at any rate the bulk of it, found inlet into a series of caverns\r\nalong the line now occupied by the gorge, and that then the processes\r\nwhich are so well known to be going on gradually enlarged these to\r\nthe point of collapse, the falling débris being removed by the still\r\nflowing stream. It is only right to add that M. Martel, arguing from\r\nhis long experience, which probably exceeds that of any man who has\r\never studied the subject, sees in the gorges of Cheddar, Burrington,\r\nand presumably Ebbor, the superficial channels worn by the escaping\r\nstreams from the ancient Mendip plateau. He says, \"The numerous dried\r\nvalleys (Burrington Combe, Cheddar Cliffs, etc.), which cut through the\r\ncircumference of the Mendips, witness, as everywhere, to the ancient\r\nsuperficial flowing off of the rivers, and to their capture by the\r\nnatural wells, successively opened and enlarged in the cracks of the\r\nLimestone rock.\" That even small streams acting through a sufficient\r\nperiod of time are capable of doing enormous erosive work it would\r\nbe idle to deny, but the difficulties in the way of accepting this\r\ntheory as alone sufficient are too great to admit of its acceptance.\r\nIt demands that the water of a very large area could find access to\r\nthe eastern end of the ravine, which itself demands that the general\r\nconfiguration of the Mendips must have been very different from that\r\npresented now. This, from the existence of the Secondary beds in their\r\npresent position, say near Harptree, was not the case; and therefore,\r\nfor the theory to hold good, we must suppose that the superficial gorge\r\nwas pre-Triassic. As it was not filled in, either in Triassic time or\r\nsubsequently, it could not have been superficial. Of course it may be\r\ncontended that the reversal of this line of argument demonstrates that\r\nthe gorge is post-Liassic and may then have been a superficial channel,\r\nbut I hold this to be disproved in my chapter on the antiquity of the\r\nMendip Caves. I am, accordingly, forced to the conclusion that the\r\nCheddar gorge was during the whole of the Secondary period a roofed-in\r\ncavern. The only difficulty which arises is a doubt as to the ability\r\nof the stream to remove so vast a bulk of falling material as must\r\nbe accounted for; but when we see the process in actual operation,\r\nas at Wookey Hole, it is only necessary to demand sufficient time,\r\nand the difficulty vanishes. That a time did arrive when the rate of\r\ncollapse more than kept pace with the destructive energy of the stream\r\nis indicated by the rapid rise which takes place in the road through\r\nthe gorge. This favours the cave theory as opposed to the superficial\r\nchannel theory, inasmuch as a superficial channel would probably have\r\nmaintained a more nearly equal depth throughout.\r\n\r\nThat the portion of M. Martel's theory which explains the absence of\r\nthe stream from the gorge is correct is very clear, there being obvious\r\nindications, notably at the western end of the ravine, where points of\r\nabsorption might be traced beneath the high cliffs, any one of which,\r\nif excavated, would almost certainly lead to the present channel of\r\nthe river beyond Gough's Caves. The Long Hole above, as pointed out in\r\nmy chapter upon the antiquity of the Mendip Caves, is corroborative\r\nevidence which tends to disprove the superficial valley theory, as it\r\nis without a doubt an old cavern of absorption, which could not have\r\nexisted had the ravine been a superficial valley. Everyone must lament\r\nthe recent developments in the Cheddar gorge by which the northern side\r\nis being hacked to pieces to provide road metal. There are thousands of\r\nplaces where the same stone could be obtained, with almost equal ease;\r\nand it does seem pitiful that one of the finest places in the kingdom\r\nshould be sacrificed to the most callous and sordid commercialism.\r\nThe conditions under which the work is being carried on constitute\r\nalso a public danger, as has now been exemplified by the collapse into\r\nthe gorge of a huge mass of the rock. The dip of the Limestone is to\r\nthe southward, and consequently any work done on the northern side is\r\nremoving the support that holds up the great mass upon an inclined\r\nplane. Of necessity the mass above, its support gone, comes hurtling\r\ndown to the roadway, and it is practically certain that, if quarrying\r\noperations continue, some day the gorge will be entirely closed by a\r\ngigantic fall.\r\n\r\nAn interesting little tributary ravine and cavern, far up the gorge,\r\nprovides a perfect example of the cave theory of the formation of the\r\ngorge itself. About two miles from the village, on the southern slopes\r\nof the ravine, is an extensive fir wood. High up on the opposite side\r\nthis little ravine is visible, and it may be reached with ease. Here\r\nsides that gently slope give way to precipitous walls, between which\r\nyou walk. Moss-grown stones give place to new-fallen stones, and then\r\nyou have before you the little ravine roofed in; you pass beneath,\r\nand find yourself in the darkness of the cavern itself, which can be\r\nfollowed for some distance. Here, at any rate, there can be no doubt as\r\nto the process that has been at work.\r\n\r\n     H. E. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF THE CAVES OF MENDIP\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the question of the age of our caverns, we are met\r\nat the outset by a mass of evidence forcing upon us the certainty\r\nthat they must be credited with a very high antiquity indeed. Here\r\nmeasurement by years and centuries fails, and the imagination must\r\nbe called in to aid us to compute the epochs that have successively\r\nelapsed since the first cave, to take one example, began to be formed\r\nat Wookey Hole. These evidences are of three kinds: historical,\r\npalæontological, and geological. In the first place, there has been\r\nobviously little change in the general configuration of our caverns\r\nsince earliest historical times. The dens and caves of the earth\r\nhave afforded a retreat to the persecuted of all generations, and a\r\nready-made home when all else has failed. Here, too, with the rocky\r\nwalls behind him and his protecting fires at the entrance, early man\r\ncould defy the savage beasts that roamed the land in those far-off days.\r\n\r\nAt Wookey Hole it was only necessary to scratch the very surface of\r\nthe accumulated débris within the mouth of the great cave to turn up\r\nfragments of Romano-British pottery and a human jaw and rib-bones.\r\nThese interesting relics are in the possession of myself and Mr. Troup.\r\nFrom the very nature of the place, it is obvious that the tendency\r\nhas been to accumulate more and more débris upon the mass of cave\r\nearth which contains these remains. Slightly deeper, yet still only\r\nin the loose earth of the cavern mouth, we found pottery of still\r\nearlier date, unwheeled and cruder. The fact is borne in upon us, that\r\ncertainly for two thousand years this entrance has remained much as it\r\nis now. Perhaps a loose rock here and there has been dislodged from\r\nthe overhanging cliff outside, and, crashing to the stream bed below,\r\nhas there been broken up and carried away by the river. But no one can\r\ndoubt that the general outline is the same now as then. And farther\r\nwithin the cavern an interesting sidelight is thrown on the slowness\r\nwith which things change in the underworld. At the descent into the\r\nfirst great chamber a chalk inscription roughly made reads \"E A 1769.\"\r\nThat inscription has been there unchanged, to my knowledge, for the\r\nlast twenty years, and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. If a\r\nchalk mark remains unerased for a century and more, how long have those\r\nsolid walls stood, and how long will they endure?\r\n\r\nAs I have gazed upon that inscription, the thought has come, that such\r\na place as this would be an ideal site for national monuments. When our\r\nabbeys and cathedrals are crumbled away, these great subterranean halls\r\nwill remain practically unchanged. And in the caves of Cheddar like\r\nevidences meet the eye. In the loose material in the Roman cave there,\r\nRoman and Romano-British remains have been found in abundance; and here\r\nagain we are forced to the conclusion that no change has taken place\r\nsince those remains were deposited.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the evidences furnished by the remains of the\r\nextinct mammalia, mingled with those of primitive man, much more is it\r\nimpressed upon the mind that we are dealing with relics of enormous\r\nantiquity. The great assemblage of bones of the extinct animals which\r\noccurs at Banwell Cave, and the numberless finds from the caves of\r\nCheddar, are indications of this; but those of the Hyæna Den of\r\nWookey Hole, and the conditions of their deposit there, afford us\r\nmuch more reliable testimony. Here are two principal cavities on the\r\neastern side of the ravine, representing two of the five river levels\r\nwhich the stream of the Axe has hollowed for itself in the Dolomitic\r\nConglomerate. These are branch or side chambers which have not been\r\ntotally destroyed in the process of erosion that formed the ravine at\r\nthe expense of the cavern. In the uppermost cavity, known as the Badger\r\nHole (it was the haunt of badgers until a few years ago), no traces\r\nof the extinct mammalia are to be found, nor have I found definite\r\ntraces of prehistoric man. At seven feet below the surface, however,\r\nthere is a bed of river sand of precisely the same kind as that in the\r\nupper chambers of the great cavern. In the Hyæna Den below, on the\r\nother hand, so thoroughly and systematically explored by Professor Boyd\r\nDawkins, was found one of the most perfect assemblages of the remains\r\nof extinct animals ever discovered. Many years after his labours were\r\ncompleted I searched there again, and was rewarded with a by no means\r\npoor collection of bones and teeth: Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros,\r\nIrish Elk and Reindeer, Red Deer, Bison, Cave Lion and Bear, Hyæna and\r\nWolf, Wild Goat, Wild Horse, and Wild Boar have all been found. One\r\nof my earliest trophies was a fairly complete skull of a young Bear;\r\nand I have representatives of all the others. From a small hole in the\r\nside of the valley hard by, which I thought looked promising, we have\r\nobtained a large number of Rhinoceros teeth, together with those of\r\nseveral of the other kinds present in the Den. The examination of these\r\ncavities and their contents demonstrates the fact that they were the\r\nactual dens of some of these animals. The abundant marks of gnawing\r\nshow that the Hyænas made their home there. Over the vertical cliff\r\nmany a worn-out beast was hunted to its death by the Hyænas and Wolves,\r\nand its shattered carcass dragged to this hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY, COINS, HUMAN REMAINS, ETC.,\r\nWOOKEY HOLE CAVE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYÆNA DEN AND BADGER HOLE, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to wander back in imagination and bring the state of things\r\nthat existed visibly before the mind's eye: to watch the unwieldy\r\nMammoth or the great Rhinoceros rolling its huge bulk along; to see the\r\npack of cowardly Hyænas or Wolves hounding some worn-out Bison to its\r\ndeath, over the awful cliff close by their den, which purpose effected,\r\nthey themselves rushed headlong down the steep slope hard by, to fight\r\nand wrangle over the shattered carcass of their prey; or to see the\r\nLion lying in wait by the peaceful stream in the little valley for the\r\nnoble Elk or timid Deer to come for its accustomed drink; and then to\r\nbehold savage Man, with his weapons of flint or bone, when out on his\r\nhunting expeditions, arriving at this peaceful valley, and there for\r\na while making his quarters in the Den, and lighting his fires at the\r\nentrance to scare the wild beasts from their lair.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Only a few years since, three cows were driven over the cliff by\r\n several unruly dogs, and of course were instantly killed. Thus was the\r\n tragedy of long ago re-enacted.\r\n\r\nHow long ago this state of things existed is a matter for geological\r\ncalculation. Suffice it that the earliest historical records show us\r\nno wild beasts existing in the land except Bears and Wolves, along\r\nwith the Red Deer which is with us to this day. Now there is no sign\r\nat Wookey Hole of the time when the Bear and Wolf alone remained and\r\nall else had become extinct from the land. There is no trace whatever\r\nin the Hyæna Den of the pottery which we find in the entrance of the\r\ngreat cave. Without a doubt, the latest deposits here are vastly older\r\nthan the most ancient deposits there. The commingling of northern,\r\ntemperate, and southern forms gives evidence of oscillations in\r\ntemperature such as demand a vast time to have taken place. Yet the\r\nwhole of these remains accumulated between the time when the entrance\r\nto the Den was left exposed by the gradual destruction and retreat\r\nof the cliff face up the valley, and the infilling and choking of the\r\nentrance by the accumulating gravel which eventually blocked it. It is\r\nonly within the last few years that the gravel arch which was first\r\nformed, and then undermined in the search after bones, has collapsed,\r\nrevealing the true configuration of the cavern. Here we must again\r\npostulate a great antiquity for our caverns, since these deposits exist\r\nin what is really an insignificant fragment of the great cavern, and\r\nare only an incidental part of the material which an exposed cavity\r\nis sure to receive. But when purely geological evidences are taken\r\ninto account, the demand for time becomes still more imperative. The\r\nsubterranean Axe occupies, as its present channel, vast chambers formed\r\nby the excavation of thousands of tons of the hard Conglomerate, great\r\nhalls over 70 feet in height and of fine proportions. The process which\r\nformed these is still at work enlarging them, till in the course of\r\ntime they must collapse; yet no change is ever visible, no signs of\r\nrecent action can at any point be seen. The rarely occurring great\r\nflood serves but to remove one film of sand from the floor and to leave\r\nanother in its place as the waters subside. So slow is the undermining\r\naction that no eye can ever detect a change though the waters rise ever\r\nso high. Yet this channel is but one of five distinct levels which the\r\nriver has occupied from time to time, until it has found in turn a\r\nlower course, leaving its sands as a record upon each, here and there\r\nsealed down beneath a mass of stalagmite. What untold ages have elapsed\r\nsince first the river flowed through these upper channels!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN AND SECTION OF WOOKEY HOLE CAVERN.]\r\n\r\nBut an examination of the top of the Mendips points to a vaster\r\nantiquity still. The published horizontal section No. 17 of the\r\nGeological Survey gives an excellent idea of the plateau of Mendip,\r\nwhich stretches from immediately north of Wells to the neighbourhood\r\nof Compton Martin. This plane of denudation would never have been\r\nreached save by the long-continued action of subterraneous streams,\r\nan assumption supported by the existence of the great depression\r\ncrossed by the road from Wells to Priddy. That depression of nearly\r\n100 feet in depth and several miles in length, hollowed in the hard\r\nCarboniferous Limestone, here dotted with every known type of swallet\r\nor swallow hole, has been obviously formed by the slow action of\r\nswallet streams prolonged through vast periods of time. Every atom of\r\nthe millions of tons of solid rock represented by this depression has\r\nbeen borne down the course of the subterranean Axe. Tributary to this\r\ndepression a little valley has been eroded across the Old Red Sandstone\r\nanticline immediately to the north, and in it are deposited masses of\r\nDolomitic Conglomerate, the component pebbles of which were derived\r\nfrom the surrounding rocks. The same valley existed, therefore, in\r\npre-Triassic time, and as there was obviously no other outlet for its\r\nwater, the cavities into which it flowed--that is to say, the swallets\r\nand subterranean channels--must have existed also, and are therefore\r\npre-Triassic in date. Though at first sight this appears impossible,\r\ninasmuch as the known course of the resulting Axe River is through\r\nTriassic Conglomerate, I propose to show that such a conclusion is\r\nnecessary and inevitable. Long ago I was struck with the fact that at\r\nWookey Hole the Triassic Conglomerate attains an abnormal thickness,\r\nand measurements have shown that at the far end of the cavern there is\r\ncertainly a thickness of over 350 feet of this rock. As there is no\r\nsign of any approach to the Limestone against which it must abut, nor\r\nany change in the character of the Conglomerate itself at this point,\r\nI think that we may fairly conclude that the total thickness of it\r\nmust be at least 500 feet. Now this is a vast deposit, far exceeding\r\nany known to exist elsewhere, and it requires a special explanation\r\nto account for it. Only one explanation is possible. The Conglomerate\r\nis here filling in some great pre-existing valley in the Mountain\r\nLimestone. That is just what I should expect.\r\n\r\nThe great Limestone cavern formed by the action of the swallet streams\r\nin early Triassic times collapsed, and formed a Limestone ravine, into\r\nwhich was rolled a great accumulation of fragments of the Limestone\r\nderived from the slopes and crags above. With the whole of this part of\r\nEngland these beds were subsequently submerged, remaining so during the\r\ndeposit of the whole of the Secondary beds; and on their emerging once\r\nmore from beneath the sea the lines of drainage were re-established\r\nalong the old courses, where these had not been choked with sedimentary\r\nmaterial. Forcing a way through the Conglomerate which then impeded its\r\nflow, the river formed those cavities which we see. Indeed, it may well\r\nbe that the successive levels cut by the Axe through the Conglomerate\r\nmay represent stages in the uplifting of the land, the lowest channel\r\nbeing the last and largest, as it has been formed during an extended\r\nperiod of stability. But we are not without evidences of another\r\nsort as to the existence of some of our swallet ways at that remote\r\nperiod. The cavities found in the Holwell quarries, near Frome, filled\r\nin with Rhaetic material containing bones and teeth of fishes; those\r\nof Gurney-Slade, near Radstock; and numbers which from time to time\r\nare laid bare in the Limestone quarries, all filled in with Triassic\r\nsediment, show that penetrating waterways of considerable size then\r\nexisted. There was, too, at Charterhouse-on-Mendip, north of Cheddar, a\r\nfissure, possibly a swallet, which, being open, received an infilling\r\nof Liassic material that is known to extend to a depth of 300 feet. Had\r\nthese channels been closed by a narrow aperture temporarily blocked,\r\nno infilling but by water would have taken place when the land sank\r\nbeneath the waters of the Triassic and Liassic seas.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the position of the entrances of many of our swallets\r\nthere is corroborative evidence to the same effect. The great circular\r\nswallet on Rookham, near Wells, situated far from any existing line of\r\ndrainage, yet withal one of the largest cavities on Mendip, shows that\r\ngreat changes have taken place since it was an active waterway. The\r\nposition of the caverns of Compton Bishop and of Banwell, far removed\r\nfrom any stream or any line of drainage possible with the present\r\ncontours, proves that the configuration of the country has utterly\r\nchanged since they formed the points of engulfment of any streams. The\r\nCoral Cave (as we have called it) at Compton Bishop descends abruptly\r\ninto the earth, and its outlet must have been far below the level\r\nwhere now the Triassic Marl forms an impervious barrier. The waters\r\nof Banwell Pond rise through the Marl, forced upwards through beds\r\nwhich do not yield water and ordinarily retard its passage. Doubtless\r\nthe Marl when it was deposited covered some earlier outlet from the\r\nLimestone. The waters of St. Andrew's Well, at Wells, are forced\r\nupwards through Dolomitic Conglomerate and overlying Pleistocene\r\ngravel, the former of which was doubtless deposited upon what was once\r\na free and unimpeded outlet from the Mountain Limestone, similar to\r\nthat of Cheddar. The water of Rickford, near Burrington, resulting from\r\nthe streams engulfed at and around Burrington, is forced up through\r\nthe Secondary beds, which have been similarly deposited upon the\r\npre-existing outlet. All these things help to demonstrate that what I\r\ncontend is true, viz. that our caverns as a whole are pre-Triassic in\r\nage. The Long Hole at Cheddar, high in the cliffs above Gough's Cave,\r\nlends its evidence too. Contrary to all the other caves at Cheddar, it\r\nwas a channel of intake for the water which formed it. Doubtless it\r\nis a fragment of a larger cavern, which, before the gorge of Cheddar\r\nitself was formed, existed in the mass of rock occupying the whole\r\narea. At the northern end of the Limestone defile of Ebbor, near Wells,\r\nthe ravine is carved through Dolomitic Conglomerate, which has been\r\nmuch worked for iron ore. The fact that this Conglomerate was deposited\r\nin a depression in the land, at the head of the present ravine, yet\r\nwithout entering it, suggests that here was an entrance to a series of\r\ncaverns, the collapse of which produced the gorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT SWALLET ON BISHOP'S LOT, PRIDDY.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. ANDREW'S WELL, WELLS.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Punchbowl, near the Castle of Comfort Inn on the Mendips,\r\nis, in all probability, a collapse of the remarkable Lias beds which\r\nthere occur into some pre-existing cavity in the Mountain Limestone\r\nbelow, somewhat in the same manner as the Shake Holes in the Glacial\r\nDrift on the Yorkshire moors were formed. No one questions the\r\nexistence of the cavities beneath before the deposit of the Drift,\r\nneither do I doubt the existence of swallets beneath the Trias and Lias\r\nbefore these were deposited on the Mendips. The question naturally\r\narises, Why do we not find in our caverns remains of all the ages\r\nthat have elapsed since that time? Why are only Pleistocene remains\r\ndiscovered? Surely, because we have not found them it does not follow\r\nthat they are nonexistent. The recent discovery of Pliocene remains\r\nin a cavern at Doveholes, near Buxton (Derbyshire), is clear proof\r\nthat we may search hopefully for similar remains in the Mendips. It\r\nmust be borne in mind, that the further we go back in time, the more\r\ncertain we are to find that the contents of any Limestone cavern would\r\nbe completely mineralised, until the whole of the contents may have\r\nbecome cemented into a solid mass. Where running water is present,\r\nattrition may have destroyed them, or borne them onwards to those great\r\ndepths where, constantly submerged as they must be, we can never hope\r\nto penetrate. I am aware, however, of the existence, in the Eastwater\r\nCavern, of very ancient chokes of water-borne material, from which I\r\nhave some hope of obtaining remains.\r\n\r\nI might mention the demonstrated antiquity of the bosses of stalagmite\r\nin Kent's Cavern at Torquay, and from it argue the immense age of\r\nthe great masses of stalagmite in the Mendip Caves, but, recognising\r\nthe variable rate of deposit of the carbonate of lime in different\r\ncaverns, and indeed in different parts of the same cavern, no useful\r\npurpose would be served thereby. The huge Beehive of Lamb's Lair at\r\nHarptree, the large boss in the first great chamber at Wookey Hole,\r\nGough's \"Niagara\" at Cheddar, the tall and slender pillars in Cox's\r\nCave at Cheddar, and the taller \"Sentinel\" pillar at Wookey Hole, all\r\ndemand for their formation a prodigious length of time, which it is but\r\nfolly to attempt to compute with our present information. Certainly\r\nmany thousands of years are required for some of them, and it should\r\nbe remembered that we have then arrived merely at the time when the\r\nfloor upon which they stand had received its final form, the action of\r\nrunning water having ceased.[2] Who can doubt then, that, as we stand\r\nin the great waterways of the profound depths of our hills, we are\r\nlooking upon scenes which have varied little since remote ages, and\r\nthat in some form or other these waterways played an important part in\r\nthe degradation of the earlier and loftier Mendip range?\r\n\r\n [2] In 1894 the initials \"T. W.\" were carved by Mr. Willcox of Wells\r\n on the great stalagmite bank in the end chamber of Lamb's Lair. I\r\n added \"1894,\" that in years to come some measure may be obtained\r\n of the rate at which this bank is being formed. I make a rule of\r\n never making an inscription, but in this case I thought that the end\r\n justified the means.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark in this connection that the veteran M. Martel,\r\ncommenting upon the caverns of Mendip, says, \"In consequence of the\r\nexistence, on the flanks of the Mendip Hills, of deposits of Triassic\r\nDolomitic Conglomerate (Keuper) of Rhaetian beds, and of possibly\r\nGlacial alluvia, unconformably on the Carboniferous Limestone, the\r\noutflow of the water in the risings operates in three ways: (A) by\r\nlarge fissures in the Limestone itself, when it flows out freely, as\r\nat Cheddar; (B) through the crevices in the Dolomitic Conglomerate\r\n(the Axe at Wookey Hole, etc.); (C) where the outlet of the water from\r\nthe Limestone is hidden by alluvia (St. Andrews Well, at Wells). The\r\nconsequence of this arrangement is that it will be possible--notably\r\nat Wookey Hole, when the explorations now going on have enlarged the\r\nnew galleries recently found--to ascertain whether the Dolomitic\r\nConglomerate is there shown in long beds of ancient shores, regularly\r\nsuperposed on the Limestone, or rather accumulated in filled-up\r\npockets, in hollows pre-existing in the Limestone; that is to say,\r\nthere will be a material verification of Mr. Balch's hypothesis\r\n(already outlined by Boyd Dawkins in 1874) of the very ancient\r\nexcavation of certain caves of the Mendip Hills, even before the Keuper\r\nperiod. The lie of the Conglomerate under the vaulted roofs of Wookey\r\nHole appeared to me to favour this idea. And it is necessary to wait\r\ntill formal proofs have been gathered together here, that caves were\r\nhollowed out there before the Trias. I recall, on this subject, that\r\nlong ago I concluded, with Messrs. De Launey, Van den Broeck, Boule,\r\netc., that the formation of caves could commence in the most distant\r\ngeological epochs, and that the pockets of phosphorites, among others\r\nat Quercy and the Albanets of Couvin (Belgium), testify to caves or\r\nabysses of at least Eocene times.\"\r\n\r\n     H. E. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVE EXPLORING AS A SPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are called a nation of sportsmen; yet the first criticism we\r\nlevel against any new sport, not our own, is the question, usually\r\nunanswerable and always irrelevant, What is the use of it? One\r\nmay then, with a certain show of propriety, point out that cave\r\nexploring is a sport not entirely lacking in utilitarian or scientific\r\nobjects. It belongs, in fact, to that large class which originated\r\nas something else than mere pastime. Mountaineering and hunting are\r\ntypical representatives of that class. The earliest mountaineers were\r\ngeographers. Cave exploring was first of all taken up as a branch of\r\narchæological and palæontological research, and then as a general\r\ninquiry into the physical nature of caves. But a science that has\r\ndiscovery as its principal object, and hardships and adventure as\r\nits natural concomitants, is bound to attract as many sportsmen as\r\nscientists. The geographical might be called the sporting sciences.\r\nAnd so there are now many ardent cave explorers who would blush to be\r\ncalled speleologists, their sole motive being the enjoyment of the\r\ngame, and scientific results purely a by-product. Thus the science of\r\ncaves has given birth to a sport that subserves its aims in the same\r\nirregular way as rock-climbing and peak-bagging subserve the aims of\r\ngeography, geology, meteorology, and other sciences.\r\n\r\nSpeleology itself is, comparatively, a new science. Cave hunting, the\r\nsearch for human and animal remains, has been an important bypath\r\nof scientific investigation since the days of Dean Buckland and\r\nthe discoveries recorded in _Reliquiæ Diluvianæ_, 1823. Professor\r\nBoyd Dawkins has in recent decades done still more valuable work\r\nfor palæontology. Speleology is a word of both wider and narrower\r\nmeaning; in the widest sense covering all kinds of knowledge about\r\ncaves, their geography, geology, hydrology, their fauna, their\r\npalæontology. But most speleologists confine their attention to\r\nthe physical characteristics of caves. This side of the inquiry\r\nhas practical utilities. At Vaucluse, for instance, near Avignon,\r\nM. Bouvier in 1878 explored the channels of a gigantic siphon that\r\ncarries the waters of an inaccessible reservoir into the Fontaine de\r\nVaucluse, a famous \"rising.\" His object was partly scientific, and\r\npartly to determine the nature of this permanent source, so as to\r\nutilise its waters to regulate the level of the Sorgue, to extend the\r\nirrigation system of the neighbourhood, and to secure water-power for\r\nmanufacturing purposes. The Katavothra of Pod-Stenami were enlarged by\r\nan enterprising engineer, and protected by iron gratings, after their\r\nsubterranean exits had been explored, and so utilised to regulate the\r\ndrainage of the marshy plains of Laibach, and to prevent periodical\r\ninundations. In our own country, underground exploration has brought to\r\nlight valuable water-supplies, and enabled us to safeguard the public\r\ninterests by pointing out sources of pollution. Caves are most abundant\r\nin the districts where those great fissures known as rakes occur,\r\nwhich are rich in minerals, especially lead, calamine, copper, gypsum,\r\nand fluor-spar. During the short period in which cave work has been\r\ntaken up as a sport, discoveries have been made, which of course it is\r\nimpossible to particularise, that may be the source of considerable\r\nprofit in the future.\r\n\r\nThe majority of those engaged in this physical exploration of caves\r\nare French. France possesses a Société de Spéléologie, the secretary\r\nof which, Monsieur E. A. Martel, author of _Les Abîmes_, is a most\r\nindefatigable and courageous explorer, and the man who has made the\r\nscience an important and a living one. But M. Martel himself awards the\r\ntitle of \"créateur de la spéléologie\" to a forgotten predecessor, Dr.\r\nAdolphe Schmidl, who published _Die Grotten und Höhlen von Adelsberg_,\r\nin 1854. In this country, although such brilliant discoveries have\r\nbeen made of extinct animals and prehistoric relics of humanity, cave\r\nexploring of this kind is a new pursuit. M. Martel says, in _Irlande\r\net Cavernes Anglaises_, 1897: \"In short, the underground of the\r\ncalcareous regions of the British Isles may be considered as being,\r\ntopographically, very insufficiently known; this is the conviction\r\nimpressed on me by my own researches in 1893.\" Something has been\r\naccomplished since that date. Two or three clubs, consisting chiefly\r\nof climbers, and a few speleologists working independently, have\r\neffected a thorough examination of the great caverns of the Peak, the\r\nextraordinary system of underground waters, huge cavities, and profound\r\nabysses in the West Riding, and the beautiful caverns of Somerset. But\r\nthe ground that remains unexplored, the opportunities for adventure and\r\nthe possibilities of discovery are such as may probably astonish those\r\npeople who think there is nothing of the sort left in Old England.\r\n\r\nCaves are formed in calcareous strata by the chemical action of water\r\nladen with carbonic acid, and by the mechanical action of streams. In\r\nconsequence of the original structure of the Limestone, the joints of\r\nwhich run at right angles to the bedding planes, these eroded hollows\r\nhave two dominant forms: the vertical pot, swallet, or hole, produced\r\nby the widening of a master-joint; and the horizontal water-channel,\r\nrunning in the same direction as the line of stratification. But the\r\nstrata being commonly tilted, these pits and abysses are often a long\r\nway out of the vertical, and the caverns that follow the strata very\r\nsteep. Many of these ancient watercourses are now dry, but others\r\nare still traversed by streams, and present the explorer with most\r\nformidable obstacles. The complete exploration of any cave system would\r\ninvolve the tracing out of all its passages from the point where the\r\nstream or streams enter the earth to the point of exit. But I know\r\nnot a single instance where such a task has been worked out in its\r\nentirety. In many cases the streams enter the ground merely as small\r\nrivulets, and begin to excavate passages practicable to man only at a\r\nconsiderable depth. \"Siphons,\" or traps, as they ought to be called,\r\ncomplete or partial chokes, and a variety of other causes, may put\r\ninsuperable obstacles in the explorer's way.\r\n\r\nTake two of the most important cave problems still awaiting solution,\r\none in Yorkshire, the other in Somerset. A large beck is precipitated\r\ninto the abyss of Gaping Ghyll, 360 feet deep, and emerges from\r\nan opening in the hillside, a mile away, close to the mouth of\r\nIngleborough Cave, which was itself an earlier exit. Several parties\r\nhave descended Gaping Ghyll, and followed the passages at the bottom\r\nto a distance of more than 1000 feet. Then impenetrable water-sinks,\r\nand muddy chambers with no outlet, have been encountered, and the\r\ncommunication with the lower cavern has hitherto proved undiscoverable.\r\nBoth the dry galleries and the canals of Ingleborough Cave have been\r\nexplored, with great toil and daring, to a considerable distance\r\nupwards, with similar results; and though many speleologists are\r\nstill absorbed in this problem, there is little hope that it will be\r\ncleared up without adopting the drastic and costly measure of cutting\r\nthrough the obstructions. The other problem is that of Wookey Hole,\r\nthe cave in Britain which has the longest history, and which is still\r\nyielding interesting discoveries. A number of streams disappear into\r\nthe earth on the Mendip plateau, 2 miles away and 700 feet above, and\r\nfind their issue in the source of the Axe at Wookey Hole. Two of the\r\nMendip swallets have been explored to a great depth. Swildon's Hole,\r\nan exquisite series of terraced galleries and stalactite grottoes, has\r\nbeen penetrated to a depth of 300 feet. But a more determined attempt\r\nhas been made to reach the bottom of the Eastwater Cavern. This was\r\ndiscovered in 1902 by my friend Mr. Balch, of Wells, by means of\r\nopening the swallet, where a tiny brook ran away through small crevices\r\nin a Limestone ravine. A far-extending cave was thus disclosed, full\r\nof intricate ramifications, that explain in a graphic manner how\r\nnew galleries are formed and old ones left dry and deserted, as the\r\nresult of floods and partial chokes. We have, in the longest route\r\ndiscovered in this complicated system, reached a distance of 2000 feet\r\nfrom the entrance and a depth below the surface of 500 feet. At this\r\npoint no absolutely impassable barrier has been met with. There is\r\nreason to hope that we may still advance farther into the mysterious\r\nregion between it and Wookey Hole. But the formidable difficulties of\r\nthe journey hither have set a limit to endurance. Hundreds of feet\r\nof creeping through steep, narrow, and contorted passages, compared\r\nwith which a series of drain-pipes would afford luxurious travelling;\r\nperpendicular drops of 50 and 90 feet, with no convenient ledges at\r\nthe top for letting men down; and, in addition, the necessity of\r\ntransporting great quantities of tackle to the bitter end of it, have\r\nmade a twelve hours' day underground as much as we could stand. The\r\ndifficulty may perhaps be got over by means of a subterranean bivouac.\r\nUnfortunately, it would not do to leave the apparatus in position for\r\nlong beforehand, as it would deteriorate so rapidly. In Wookey Hole\r\nitself, we have not yet succeeded in reaching a farther distance than\r\n600 feet from the cave mouth; there a submerged tunnel has stood in\r\nthe way. But Mr. Balch has thoroughly explored the upper passages that\r\nhoneycomb the rock above the known caves; he has discovered a number\r\nof promising galleries, which are being slowly cleared of débris;\r\nand, among them, a series of the most beautiful incrusted grottoes in\r\nBritain. A season of drought may reveal an opening up the river-course.\r\n\r\nInnumerable similar problems still await solution. Some of us have been\r\nengaged in trying with pick and crowbar to engineer a way into the\r\nswallets above Castleton, which send their waters through the heart of\r\nthe hills down to the caves in the dale of Hope. One of these, which\r\nwe have penetrated to a distance of 350 feet, may turn out to be the\r\nentrance to as wonderful a chain of caverns as those of Eastwater. Long\r\nKin Hole, Helln Pot, and other tremendous cavities in the Ingleborough\r\ndistrict, still promise good sport. Of all the varieties of cave\r\nforms these vertical holes are the most impressive, and also the most\r\nperilous to explore. No exploit stands out more finely in the record of\r\nthat intrepid explorer, M. Martel, than his single-handed descent into\r\nGaping Ghyll, the first ever accomplished. In the Cevennes, however, he\r\nhas reached the bottom of abysses still more profound, though without\r\nthe unpleasant accompaniment of falling water. One of the most awkward\r\nof the descents described by him is that of the Aven de Vigne Close\r\n(Ardèche), 190 mètres in depth. This strange pit is almost a corkscrew\r\nin shape, comprising five perpendicular drops, the bottom of one being\r\na few feet from the top of the next. To manage the final pitch, with\r\na chain of rope ladders 40 mètres too short, it was necessary to get\r\nsix men down to the \"Salle à Manger\" at the foot of the fourth stage,\r\nothers remaining as sentinels at the head of the various stages. Some\r\nof these waited on their narrow perches for eleven hours, in the dark,\r\nwith nothing to do but listen to the distant noises of their comrades\r\nat work. One man, hanging at the end of a rope, succeeded single-handed\r\nin fastening a pulley to the free end of the second ladder, and so let\r\ndown the third ladder to the required extent. This critical operation\r\nwas carried out under grave difficulties, the nerves of the whole party\r\nhaving been shaken a few minutes earlier by the accidental fall of a\r\nheavy lamp, which was within an inch of killing the men beneath.\r\n\r\nElden Hole, in the Peak of Derbyshire, a yawning cavity 200 feet deep,\r\nwith an inner cave 65 feet deeper, has been descended several times\r\nrecently. On the first occasion, through the inexperience of the party,\r\nI had the privilege of spending nine hours in the hole, in a state of\r\nuncertainty as to whether it was in the power of the other men to get\r\nme out. On the next occasion, we let down a dozen men safely. But there\r\nstill remains the possibility that excavation might clear up the puzzle\r\nas to the connection of Elden Hole with other swallets and caves in the\r\nvicinity. The old miners believed that it had communication with the\r\nnatural chambers in the Speedwell Mine; and that is a problem which\r\nwill entail exploration in collapsible boats along the flooded levels.\r\nThe great chasm in the Speedwell, which used to be reputed bottomless,\r\nhas been proved to be only 90 feet deep. It has an upward extension,\r\nin the same steep rake, which has not been climbed, nor its top so\r\nmuch as caught sight of. It attains a height, most probably, of at\r\nleast 400 feet. That is a problem worthy the mettle of our most skilful\r\ncragsmen. In the Blue John Mine, a vertical fissure has been climbed,\r\nby a party properly roped up, to the height of 130 feet, between walls\r\nsplendidly adorned with polished and translucent stalagmite. Ladders\r\nmay sometimes be rigged up, one above another, to reach hollows in\r\nthe roof of caves. In this way a handsome grotto was discovered above\r\nPeak Cavern. When these vertical fissures are open to the sky, it is\r\na simple matter to fix tackle, and even a windlass, for letting men\r\ndown. When they open in the floor of a well-nigh impracticable gallery,\r\nas in the Eastwater Cavern, the difficulties of securing pulleys and\r\nropes are serious. There our troubles are aggravated by the proximity\r\nof deep, gaping chasms at the foot of each pitch, lying in wait to\r\nreceive falling bodies. Nevertheless, by an ingenious arrangement of\r\nlife-line and pulley, the entire party gets safely to the bottom of the\r\ngulf and back again, although it is usual in such situations to leave\r\na sentry behind at the top. Grandest of all these underground cavities\r\nin England is the great chamber of Lamb's Lair, in the Mendips. The\r\napproaches and subsidiary chambers of that marvellous cavern are\r\nmagnificent in the richness of their incrustation and their colouring;\r\nbut this mighty hall surpasses the rest by far. Floor, walls, and\r\nroof, of a dome-shaped chamber 110 feet high, are a mass of sculptured\r\ntransparencies, fantastic reliefs and glowing enamel, all the colours\r\nof the rainbow being produced by the different veins of minerals. Only\r\na strong party of experienced climbers or cave workers, fully equipped,\r\nshould venture to explore this fine cavern in its present dangerous\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nNo chapters in _Les Abîmes_ are more absorbing than those describing\r\nthe exploration of underground waters. By means of collapsible boats,\r\nM. Martel explored the concealed streams that tumble into the canyon\r\nof the Ardèche. In 1890-91, M. Mazauric, with enormous toil and\r\nconsiderable danger, traced out the labyrinthine ramifications of the\r\nBonheur at Bramabiau (Gard). The Tindoul de la Vayssière (Aveyron),\r\nwith its yawning abyss and powerful subterranean torrent, and the\r\nCausse de Gramat (Padirac), both entailed the descent of a deep chasm\r\nand the navigation of large streams. At Padirac the exploring party\r\nmade their way in four boats along a river, with frequent portages\r\ncaused by dykes of stalagmite, and discovered some of the most\r\nexquisite and romantic stalactite scenery in the vaults through which\r\nthe river flows.\r\n\r\nAs a sport, cave exploring ranks high. The exertion it entails is\r\nexceedingly severe. The innumerable obstacles and difficult problems\r\nto be faced make incessant demands on our inventiveness, adaptability,\r\nand presence of mind. The exposure, the hardships, the dangers that\r\nmust be encountered, form an admirable discipline. Those who consider\r\nthese any detraction from the merits of the sport, must condemn, not\r\none sport, but a whole class. Running risks, we must remember, is\r\nalways foolhardy, but to nullify danger by means of science and skill\r\nis an aim worthy of the noblest kinds of sport. It will, of course, be\r\nobjected that the lack of exhilarating conditions, and of the stimulus\r\nof fresh air, deprives the sport of the usual benefits of outdoor\r\ngames. But the air at the bottom of a cave 100 or more feet deep is\r\nusually as pure and sweet, and not seldom as dry, owing to its free\r\ncirculation, as that on the hills. Then the darkness and the sense of\r\nimprisonment, you say, are not conducive to healthy enjoyment. But a\r\ncave explorer, enthralled by the manifold interest and excitement of\r\nthe pastime, will never admit this. The variety of entertainment it\r\naffords constitutes a peculiar charm.\r\n\r\nOnly to judge by the number of climbers that have taken up cave work\r\nas a pastime, there must obviously be a natural relation between this\r\nsport and rock climbing. Certainly, there are many methods common to\r\nthe two sports, and the expert cragsman has an immense advantage over\r\nothers when he takes to cave exploring. But the methods and appliances\r\nof the mountaineer are restricted by artificial regulations. There are\r\nmany things that must not be done, even to enable a climber to ascend\r\nan otherwise inaccessible peak or to avoid serious peril. In cave work,\r\non the other hand, the difficulties and dangers are multiplied so\r\nformidably by the singular conditions, of which darkness is but one,\r\nthat such prohibitions would be absurd. When one may be called upon to\r\nclimb a wall of mud, or a sheet of slippery stalagmite, or to traverse\r\nwater-swept rocks with an unfathomed pool or swallet underneath,\r\nevery safeguard must needs be utilised. Any mechanical means of\r\naccomplishing, facilitating, or expediting a passage is legitimate in\r\ncave work; ropes, pulleys, ladders of rope and wood, windlass, rafts,\r\nboats, crowbar, pick, shovel--all these, and an enormous variety of\r\nother things, have their place in the cave explorer's equipment.\r\n\r\nOne might write a volume on the equipment of cave explorers. Hardly any\r\nother sport requires so formidable a variety. I must limit myself to a\r\nfew words. The explorer's dress should be a boiler suit, made all in\r\none piece from neck to heel, and with no pockets or buttons to catch\r\nin the jagged Limestone, plenty of both being provided inside. He must\r\nrenounce any hankering after waterproof garments, the proper precaution\r\nagainst the effects of wet being to wear thick woollen underclothing.\r\nHis boots should be nailed after the manner of those worn by rock\r\nclimbers. Candles are the best illuminant, much better than any\r\nlamp--acetylene, electric, or other. But a supply of magnesium wire\r\nshould be carried, with waterproofed matches in water-tight boxes; and\r\na powerful limelight, burning ether instead of hydrogen, for the sake\r\nof portability, is a useful auxiliary. Boats have been used in some\r\nof the caves in the Peak, in Wookey Hole, and in the cavern of Marble\r\nArch, explored by M. Martel, in Ireland. Plenty of rope--not of the\r\nAlpine Club material, but hempen--is necessary, and a few rope ladders\r\noften come in handy. The only rule of the game that I should like to\r\ninsist upon is, that no damage should be done to the beautiful features\r\nof a cave. It is a rule observed by every cave explorer worthy of the\r\nname. The temptation to acquire specimens must be resisted.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that the cave explorer, eager for discovery, has to\r\nlearn, is not to lose himself. In many cases no special precautions are\r\nnecessary, but if there are numerous bifurcations, specific measures\r\nmust be adopted. Often it is sufficient to station a hurricane lamp or\r\na good-sized candle at the cross roads; a surer method, but one that is\r\nrather troublesome, is to unreel a thread as we advance. Such a cavern\r\nas Goatchurch, in Burrington Combe, Somerset, is a perplexing maze,\r\nwhere one loses one's bearings completely two minutes after looking\r\nat the compass. The mass of the hill is shivered into innumerable\r\nfragments, of giant size. Passages striking off along the fractures\r\noften lead one back imperceptibly to the point of divergence. At the\r\nEastwater Cavern, in the same district, after I had already gone four\r\ntimes through the enormous aggregation of shattered rocks at the top,\r\nwhere a human body is like a beetle in a heap of macadam, I tried in\r\nvain to make my way out without using the life-line. Although there is\r\nbut 100 feet of it, one takes half an hour to get through. The original\r\nexplorers spent a much longer time in discovering a practicable route.\r\nFor my own part, I was lost in a few moments, and compelled to return.\r\nThe imprudence of two men in the Bagshawe Cavern, in Derbyshire, who\r\nwent too far in advance in their anxiety to be discoverers, led to an\r\nuncomfortable experience both for them and for their rescuers. This\r\nvery extensive cavern has a number of ramifications. The two men who\r\nwere following reached a distant and unexplored part of the cave, only\r\nto find that they had missed their comrades, the sand and clay on the\r\ncave floor being still perfectly smooth and untrodden. They failed to\r\ndiscover the wanderers in the neighbouring passages, and lost their\r\nown way for a time before they got back, through the winding tunnels,\r\nlow-roofed fissures, and deep canals, crawling, scrambling, and wading\r\nbreast-deep through icy water, to the place where they had parted.\r\nThey hoped the truants had found their way back, but there was no sign\r\nof them, and preparations had to be made for a second journey. After\r\na fatiguing quest, that lasted several hours, they found the missing\r\nadventurers in a remote part of the cavern, nursing their last shred\r\nof candle and waiting to be rescued. The experiences of some youthful\r\nexplorers in Wookey Hole, who found themselves on dangerous ground and\r\nall their matches gone, are described on another page.\r\n\r\nThere is a romance about cave exploring that is almost unrivalled.\r\nThe conditions of the sport are so weird and exciting, so strangely\r\ndifferent from everything we are accustomed to. To be so near to, and\r\nyet so far from, the scenes of our everyday life; to be launched on a\r\nvoyage of discovery on an English river, or to be the first to gaze on\r\nsome miracle of fantastic crystallisation only a few miles away from\r\na large town--these are among the attractions of the sport, at least\r\nin its present stage. There is nothing in this country to compare with\r\nthe prodigious caves of Kentucky or the terrific subterranean defiles\r\nof Adelsberg. One might as well look for the magnificence of the Alps\r\namong our English mountains. Yet the caves and gulfs of Derbyshire and\r\nYorkshire have a grandeur of structure and diversity of character, and\r\nthe Somerset caves a brilliance of crystalline deposits, that are fully\r\nas admirable and impressive.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORING WOOKEY HOLE\r\n\r\n  \"Where Albion's western hills slope to the sea,\r\n   There is a cave, and o'er its dismal mouth,\r\n   Whence come to quick, mysterious ears hoarse sounds\r\n   Of giant revelry, the ivy grew\r\n   And shut the old sepulchral darkness in;\r\n   And by its side a well, whence ever full\r\n   And ever overflowing, silent, deep,\r\n   And cold as death, the waters creep\r\n   Adown the broken rocks in search of day.\r\n   Above it frowns a fretted, stony brow,\r\n   And only from the setting sun e'er came\r\n   Within that place the joyfulness of light.\"\r\n\r\n  W. W. SMITH, _Angels and Men_: a Poem.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly anywhere else in Britain is the mind borne down with such\r\na sense of incalculable antiquity as at Wookey Hole. Nowhere,\r\ncertainly, is there anything like such a continuous record from ages\r\ninconceivably remote. To touch first of all upon periods that are\r\nhistorical and measurable, we have the name Wookey, which appears to\r\nbe the one bestowed by the ancient Britons; for it is a recognisable\r\ncorruption--especially as the people of the district sound it,\r\n\"Ookey\"--of the Celtic Ogo, a cavern, the same word, Ogof, as the\r\nmodern Welsh still apply to several caves in the Principality. Clemens\r\nAlexandrinus, in the second century A.D., has a reference to the\r\ncavern, and there are periodical allusions in Latin and English writers\r\nfrom that time to the present. In the Middle Ages its fame as one of\r\nthe wonders of England was great. William of Worcester has a quaint\r\ndescription; he says, \"Its entrance is narrow, and the ymage of a man\r\nstands beside it called the Porter, of whom leave to enter the Hall of\r\nWokey is to be obtained.\" What became of this janitor is now unknown,\r\nunless he be represented by the recumbent monolith still to be seen\r\noutside the portal. References to the antiquities of Wookey Hole occur\r\nin Leland's _Itinerary_ and in Camden's _Britannia_, and there is\r\nincorporated in Percy's _Reliques_ a ballad, by an eighteenth-century\r\nvirtuoso, Dr. Harrington of Bath, entitled \"The Witch of Wokey,\"\r\nrecounting an old legend of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n  \"In aunciente dayes, tradition showes,\r\n   A base and wicked elfe arose\r\n   The Witch of Wokey hight.\"\r\n\r\nSo it begins, and goes on to relate, in the sham antique style of the\r\nday, how a malevolent old woman was for her misdeeds changed to stone\r\nby a \"lerned clerk of Glaston.\" The Witch, a black, aquiline profile\r\nin stone and stalagmite, is with her culinary utensils the chief\r\nattraction to sightseers in the first great chamber, or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, the Witch's Kitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFILE OF THE \"WITCH OF WOOKEY,\" WOOKEY HOLE CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMONG THE POOLS, WOOKEY HOLE CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\nIt is impressive enough to stand beside the very modern-looking\r\npaper-mill, where the infant Axe, still dazzled by its sudden entry\r\ninto the sunlight, is harnessed to assist in the manufacture of such\r\nworkaday commodities as Bank-note paper, and to see before one things\r\nthat carry the memory back all those stages; yet it is but the last\r\nfew pages of the voluminous history that we are considering now.\r\nProfessor Boyd Dawkins, who won his spurs as a palæontologist by his\r\nresearches at Wookey Hole, discovered in the neighbouring Hyæna Den,\r\nwhich is really a branch of the old cavern, human and animal remains\r\nwhose antiquity, compared with the periods just reviewed, is as the age\r\nof Stonehenge compared with that of a man. In the less known passages\r\nof the Hole itself, such relics have constantly been found in the\r\ncourse of our investigations. Potsherds, celts, bone implements, the\r\ncarbonised embers from ancient hearths, all sorts of refuse lying in\r\nodd corners, have continually brought us, as it were, face to face with\r\nthe time when man was little more than the king of beasts. Whosoever\r\nwould read in the deeper chapters of this vast chronicle must be\r\nreferred to the fascinating pages of _Cave Hunting_; there will be only\r\nan occasional glance at the human history in this record of a different\r\nclass of exploration. Palæontological research has not been our object.\r\nSeveral of my companions have made some valuable discoveries in this\r\nline, and are intent on making more; but my own original motive, and\r\nthat of several others, was the sport, as much as the scientific\r\nresults, to be enjoyed in endeavouring to work out the great problem of\r\nthe waters that have made themselves a road through the underworld of\r\nMendip, and found an escape from bondage at Wookey Hole. This cavern\r\nhas been known so long and so familiarly, that it must have seemed as\r\nif there were nothing more to be found out about it. It will, surely,\r\nbe a surprise to many to learn what important additions have recently\r\nbeen made to the extent of its known and accessible passages, and\r\nwhat progress there has been in explaining the secrets of its water\r\nsystem. We are, in all probability, on the brink of yet more startling\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\nDrayton complained, in \"Polyolbion,\" that the renown of the Devil's\r\nHole in the Peak of Derbyshire, then as in the present day, had robbed\r\nthe Somersetshire cave of some of its glory.\r\n\r\n  \"Yet Ochy's dreadful Hole still held herself disgrac'd\r\n   With th' wonders of this Isle that she should not be plac'd:\r\n   But that which vex'd her most, was that the Peakish Cave\r\n   Before her darksome self such dignity should have.\"\r\n\r\nMany things here bring to mind the Derbyshire cavern, which several\r\nof our party had explored pretty thoroughly before we did any serious\r\nwork in Somerset--the approach along the deep wooded ravine cut through\r\nthe Dolomitic Conglomerate, the river pouring out from vast reservoirs\r\nwithin the earth, the legendary associations, and the mystery shrouding\r\nthe stream's subterranean course. From the drainage area about Priddy,\r\n700 feet above, on the top of Mendip, these waters find their way\r\ndown through a multitude of channels. Most of these passages are\r\nquite unknown, but the two most important, of which a good deal will\r\nbe said presently,--the Eastwater Swallet and Swildon's Hole,--have\r\nbeen explored to a considerable depth. In the latter we have got to a\r\ndepth of 300 feet, but natural obstacles and other difficulties have\r\nprevented us from following the stream-course farther. Mr. Balch has\r\ntraced the Eastwater Swallet, which he opened in 1902, to the depth\r\nof 500 feet below the point of absorption--almost, that is to say,\r\ndown to the level of Wookey Hole; but an enormous thickness of rock\r\nstill remains unexplored between the farthest points attained, from\r\nbelow upwards and from above downwards. Most likely, when we get\r\nfarther, if we succeed in passing the present obstacles, we shall soon\r\nfind ourselves entering the canals and water caverns that lie on the\r\nsame level as the great natural reservoirs of Wookey Hole; in other\r\nwords, we are approaching the plane of saturation. Exploration in the\r\nEastwater Swallet is still being carried on, though perforce very\r\nslowly; and concurrently therewith, efforts are being made, not without\r\nsuccess, to trace the passages in the lower cavern farther and farther\r\nback.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASS OF STALAGMITE, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE FIRST CHAMBER, WOOKEY HOLE CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nThe summer tourist, conducted through the three principal chambers\r\nof Wookey Hole by a guide armed with a can of benzoline, for making\r\nstalagmites into torches, comes out having a very imperfect knowledge\r\nof the geography of the cavern, and a totally inadequate idea of\r\nits beauties. I well remember how little I was impressed by my first\r\nvisit, under these conditions, many years ago. The weak illumination\r\nseemed to reveal only the proportions of some rather large cellars,\r\npervaded by oily pools, into which the contents of the can were poured\r\nand set on fire, producing an unearthly glare through the darkness and\r\nthe waters; and a number of dingy and unconvincing natural effigies,\r\nblack with the accumulation of soot. Our exploring party in March 1903\r\nsaw these things under an illumination such as had never been kindled\r\nthere before, and I for one was quite unprepared for the revelation of\r\nbrilliance and spaciousness and beauty that we were to witness.\r\n\r\n\"Wokey Hole,\" says Bishop Percy, \"has given birth to as many wild,\r\nfanciful stories as the Sybil's (sic) Cave in Italy. Through a very\r\nnarrow entrance it opens into a large vault, the roof whereof, either\r\non account of its height or the thickness of the gloom, cannot be\r\ndiscovered by the light of torches. It goes winding a great way\r\nunderground, is crost by a stream of very cold water, and is all horrid\r\nwith broken pieces of rock: many of these are evident petrifactions,\r\nwhich, on account of their singular forms, have given rise to the\r\nfables alluded to in this poem,\" the story, that is, of the blear-eyed\r\nhag who was turned into stone. This quaint description is true in every\r\nparticular. The first cavern, or the \"Witch's Kitchen,\" has a weird\r\nsimilitude to Gothic architecture. Arch springs from arch up to the\r\nlofty summit, and the walls and vaulting are full of canopied recesses,\r\nwith wild foliations of glistening calcite wreathed from niche to niche.\r\n\r\nBelow us, as we enter, a broad deep pool stretches away into darkness.\r\nCould we follow the gently moving current in a boat, we should enter\r\nanother great vault, whose existence the ordinary visitor never\r\nsuspects. There, in a small passage beyond the water, Mr. Balch\r\ndiscovered human remains. Whilst we peered into the gloom, the\r\nlimelight was burning up, and now it flashed across the cavern to where\r\nthe black scowling head of the Witch overshadows terraces, basins, and\r\nwild imageries of spectral stalagmite.\r\n\r\n          \"A glow! a gleam!\r\n           A broader beam\r\n  Startles those realms of endless night,\r\n  While bats whirl round on slanting wing,\r\n  Astonished at this awful thing.\r\n  The rocky roof's reflected rays\r\n  Are caught up in the waterways,\r\n  And every jewelled stalactite\r\n  Is bathed in that stupendous light,\r\n  One moment only; then the caves\r\n  Are plunged again in Stygian waves;\r\n  The fairy dream has passed away\r\n  And night resumes her ancient sway.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Whiteparish, near Salisbury, wrote these expressive lines\r\nafter seeing Wookey Hole lighted up with magnesium. Our beam of light\r\nwas less transitory, and gave us ample leisure to contemplate the\r\nglories of this magnificent chamber. Its walls for the most part are\r\ncoloured a rich red, which absorbs light readily and makes photography\r\na slow business. The first exposure took half an hour. Against the\r\nwarm red, the pearly streaks of stalactite and stalagmite shine in\r\nexquisite relief. There is a superb mass of stalactite near the Witch;\r\nto say truth, the eye is confounded by the wild grouping of fantastic\r\npiles of dripstone around that uncouth head; the colours of the rocks\r\nand the flashing crystallisations are reflected in the pellucid water,\r\nand confused again with our glimpses of the river-bed, smitten by the\r\nmoving shaft of light. On the nearer side of the cave, where a narrow\r\narch leads into an incrusted grotto, a gentle stream has deposited\r\na fairy-like series of fonts and stoups, ending in a pure white\r\nsheet of dripstone, over which the water murmurs. The surface of all\r\nthese fabrications is diapered over with a network of delicate pearly\r\nridges; so that here you see a mass, as it were, of polished brain\r\ncoral, and there madrepores and alcyonaria, where the deposits have\r\ncontinued their growth under water. Some of these efflorescences are\r\nlike petrified filaments of water weed. The foul scurf and soot that\r\ncovers the Witch's cooking apparatus and other accessories would,\r\ndoubtless, disappear under a fresh deposit of pristine white, would\r\nthe guides but cease for a twelvemonth to drench them in benzoline,\r\nfor the delectation of such as love conundrums in stone. Still, these\r\nthings are but a small part of the scenery, when all is lighted up as\r\nwe were able to light it. Our work done, a Bengal fire was set off, and\r\nthe glimpses it gave us along the waterway to the inaccessible chamber\r\nbeyond added vastness and mystery to the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE TERRACE, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT RIVER CHAMBER, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Dawkes & Partridge, Wells._]\r\n\r\nThe next chamber is a loftier vault, and the arching is more decidedly\r\nGothic in its suggestiveness. Two low arches at either side form\r\nthe portals, far above which a series of pointed arches spring to a\r\nheight of 70 feet, their summits converging in a polygonal cleft, like\r\nthe lantern of some cathedral dome. Then we make our way across the\r\nsandbanks, between the pools, into the largest chamber of all, with a\r\nroof of enormous span, whose breadth dwarfs its height, arching over\r\nthe sleeping river and the broad slopes of sand, whereon grotesque\r\nLimestone monoliths take the likeness of prehistoric monsters sleeping\r\nby the waterside. Through the clear water we can discern a submerged\r\narch communicating with more distant caverns. There is a tradition,\r\ncoming down from the mediæval historians, that unfathomable lakes lie\r\nbehind the barrier. This is probably true in so far as it points to the\r\nexistence of enormous reservoirs of water beyond the accessible parts\r\nof Wookey Hole, the theory being confirmed by the behaviour of the silt\r\nat flood time. Were the hatches belonging to the paper-mill opened,\r\nand the water lowered a few feet, an attempt might be made to solve\r\nthese problems. Mr. Balch did, in fact, at a time when the water was\r\npartially lowered, make his way into two unexplored chambers, fed by\r\ntunnels submerged a foot or so below the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND GREAT CHAMBER, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Dawkes & Partridge, Wells._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE OF THIRD CHAMBER, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Dawkes & Partridge, Wells._]\r\n\r\nThe older and the newer caves and passages of Wookey Hole lie at five\r\nlevels, one above the other like five storeys, the topmost of all\r\nrepresenting the oldest channel of the subterranean Axe, which has\r\nin the course of ages forsaken first one and then the other, boring\r\nfresh passages in the Conglomerate. Of these five storeys, one alone,\r\nthe nethermost, is known to the uninitiated visitor. Portions of the\r\nother four had been explored from time to time by Mr. Balch, who in\r\n1903 made such discoveries of unknown continuations as fill us with\r\nhopes of penetrating deeply into the mysterious region beyond. Climbing\r\ninto the Upper Series from a spot near the threshold of the Witch's\r\nKitchen, we made our way eastward over dry rocks, and came speedily\r\nto the junction with another passage from nearer the cave mouth.\r\nOnly a thin leaf of rock separates the two, for it is characteristic\r\nof all these upper passages that they run almost parallel to each\r\nother whilst rising to other levels. Altogether, we doubled back on\r\nour original direction three or four times, creeping through holes\r\nin the walls partitioning the corridors, and ascending to the top of\r\nseveral lofty bridges, formed by fragments that have fallen from roof\r\nand walls and wedged themselves securely. The construction of these\r\nbridges is often marvellous to see. In one case a number of rocks form\r\nan irregular arch, at the top of which a keystone wedges the whole\r\ncluster together. Obviously they must have fallen and come together\r\npractically at the same instant. This was what happened hard by with\r\ntwo great boulders that fell down the rift and caught each other in\r\nmid-air. Another impressive natural structure is known to explorers\r\nof Wookey Hole as the Spur and the Wedge. The huge horizontal peak of\r\nLimestone projecting into the chasm brings to mind a famous passage in\r\nMr. Rider Haggard's _She_. This spot was the scene of a droll adventure\r\nthat befell one of my companions years ago. With several other boys,\r\nhe wandered into these passages, when suddenly the one candle they\r\nhad with them went out. A boy had been commissioned to bring a supply\r\nof matches, but it was ascertained that he had only one left, which\r\non being struck promptly went out. In this emergency, the lads could\r\ndo nothing but sit still until help arrived. They had no food, and\r\nin trying to feel the time, they broke the hands of the only watch.\r\nThey computed that they had been in durance three days when the rescue\r\nparty reached the spot, but the protracted and hungry period of waiting\r\nturned out to be only eight hours. Their resting-place was the flat\r\nback of the pinnacle, with a 60-foot drop on one side and jagged rocks\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nIn two places in these galleries there are fine displays of stalagmite\r\non the wall, in the form of corrugated sheets, the ridges of which,\r\nstained red with ferrous deposits, hang straight down like a series of\r\norgan pipes. The walls glisten here and there with minute crystals.\r\nBut the most striking sight is where the Dolomitic Conglomerate, of\r\nwhich the walls are composed, appears in clean-cut sections. One of\r\nthese, which has been successfully photographed, shows the differently\r\ncoloured pebbles, chiefly Mountain Limestone with a few of Old Red\r\nSandstone, embedded in the matrix, and surrounded with distinct layers\r\nof cement, all as brilliantly defined as the concentric rings of an\r\nagate. Hard by is a corner where Mr. Balch discovered the bones of\r\na man; they were mineralised, but it was impossible to tell their\r\nperiod, or even whether they represented an interment, or were merely\r\nthe remains of some wanderer from his tribe who had perished in this\r\nforlorn spot.\r\n\r\nSleeping bats hung from many a coign, and would not be awakened even\r\nwhen lifted down. Big cave spiders crawled over the walls in the parts\r\nadjoining the open air, where the breeze found its way in, although\r\nwe could not see through the narrowing crevices. Here and there the\r\ncocoons of the spiders hung from the roof in white, woolly balls. At\r\nthe farthest point reached was a settlement of jackdaws, with a number\r\nof untidy-looking nests, and there we could hear a thrush singing in\r\nthe trees outside; for we were close to the main cliff, and the river\r\nwas flowing out beneath our feet, under a great thickness of rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE GROTTO: NEW CHAMBERS, WOOKEY HOLE CAVE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE GROTTO, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Claude Blee._]\r\n\r\nBy the natural falling in of the roof, the first great chamber of\r\nWookey has broken through into the galleries above, and certain\r\npassages of the Upper Series now open high up in the vault of the\r\nWitch's Kitchen. One of these openings has been known for years;\r\nanother, which we reconnoitred carefully in March 1903, has now had\r\nits barrier of cave earth cut through, with the result that a group\r\nof stalactite chambers of wonderful beauty has been disclosed, with\r\nuntold possibilities of further advance. Boxing Day 1903 was spent in\r\nan exploration of these new chambers. Climbing on my shoulders, Mr.\r\nBalch got hand-hold in a chink of the Limestone, and pulled himself up\r\n10 feet. Here a stalagmite peg held the rope ladder whilst we clambered\r\nafter, entering a cross gallery that gives access by another short\r\nscramble to the loveliest of the new grottoes. When the discovery was\r\nmade, Mr. Balch and his assistants had to keep watch and ward day and\r\nnight, until a door had been fitted up, and every hole and crevice\r\nsecurely blocked; for the entire village was quickly on the scene, and\r\nirretrievable damage might have been committed.\r\n\r\nThe grotto is irregular in shape, and the incrustations are\r\ndisposed without order or system. From every nook and corner in the\r\nsuperimpending rocks bundles of stalactite spears are thrust; bosses\r\nand pillars spring from the floor, and sometimes meet the descending\r\nshafts. Of all these frail pillars, the finest, rising on the very edge\r\nof the rift we had ascended, seems to support the whole ponderous roof,\r\nlike the fragile column left by a dexterous architect, to cheat the\r\neye, in some cathedral vestibule. Certain of these hanging shafts are\r\nshaped like the barbed head of a spear, a slanting stalactite having\r\nintercepted and coalesced with the dripping calcite from an inch or\r\ntwo away. A creamy, brownish yellow, with a golden lustre like that of\r\namber, is the prevailing tint; but, here and there, plaques of dazzling\r\nwhite shine out against the burning magnesium.\r\n\r\nCrawling in and out among the stalagmite pedestals, grievously afraid\r\nof injuring the diaphanous fabric, we emerged in a very low chamber of\r\ngreat area, right across which a grille of translucent rods, each a\r\nfoot high and ranged in regular line, fills the narrow space between\r\nroof and floor. This extraordinary and strangely beautiful railing is\r\nsome 30 feet long, and only in one spot is it possible, by dint of\r\ncareful wriggling, to pass between the rods into the farther parts\r\nof the chamber. Mr. Balch entreated me not to attempt this. When he\r\ntried it, a fortnight ago, he had indeed got through to the series of\r\ncaves beyond, but, in returning, a projection had caught him at the\r\nlowest spot, where the chamber is only nine inches high, and he had\r\nstruggled hard for twenty minutes before he could move an inch. Two\r\nof us, notwithstanding this advice, ventured through. After draining\r\noff a pool of water that was held back by a thin rim of dripstone, we\r\ntraversed the low chamber and a short tunnel beyond, climbed a vertical\r\ncleft, and entered another low chamber of immense length and breadth,\r\nwhose various extensions we explored until the accumulated deposits\r\nof boulders and cave earth stopped our advance for the time being.\r\nIn returning through the tunnel and the low chamber with the grille,\r\nwe tried successfully to dive under the archway and wriggle into the\r\nopening head foremost, in spite of two opposing stumps of stalagmite.\r\nBy these tactics we escaped the worst of the squeeze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE PILLARS, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Claude Blee._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW STALACTITE GROTTO, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nWhilst engaged in this excursion, we had heard the sound of hammering\r\nsomewhere away in the heart of the rock. It was our three friends\r\nattempting to break into a promising gallery, which ought to cross\r\nthe vestibule of the main cavern and connect the two groups of upper\r\ncaves. We were not long in joining them; and now with pick, hammer,\r\nand crowbar we attacked the barrier in force. The chief obstacle was\r\na great flat rock standing on end across the unexplored opening, and\r\npropped up by a heap of boulders, which we gradually smashed up or\r\nremoved to one side. Still the big fellow would not budge, and we\r\nhad to sap his foundations by degrees. Yet this huge rock was but a\r\nfragment that had fallen from the edge of a vast and threatening leaf\r\nof rock, which now hung over our heads like a monstrous guillotine. The\r\nupper caves are waterless, and it soon became desirable to send one\r\nof our number to fetch us a drink. Presently we heard a plaintive cry\r\nfrom the distance: his candle had gone out, and he had forgotten the\r\nmatches. Going to the rescue, I found him groping about on a shelf of\r\nrock, 30 feet from the floor, hard by the Spur and Wedge; he had lost\r\nhis bearings altogether. On his return, we made another onslaught upon\r\nour rocky adversary, the five of us sitting on his shoulder and pushing\r\nagainst the wall, whilst our leader waxed grimly facetious as to what\r\nwould happen to us if the shock brought down the guillotine. Slowly\r\nand painfully we tilted the mass of rock over, but only a few inches,\r\nleaving just room enough for a thin man to crawl behind. Squirming\r\neagerly into the opening, I looked under, and was disappointed to see\r\nthat, if wide, it was still heaped right to the crown of the arch\r\nby the rubbish flung there long ago by the river. Nevertheless, Mr.\r\nBalch was not dissatisfied. Though parts of these ancient waterways\r\nare choked with débris, it is unlikely, nay impossible, that the main\r\nchannels should not remain open. Our day's work had taken us on another\r\nstage in our slow journey. The labour of removing the new obstacle will\r\nbe considerable, but the result is sure.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 we had the pleasure of escorting that veteran speleologist,\r\nMonsieur E. A. Martel, through the old and the new caves at Wookey\r\nHole. About the same time efforts were made anew to force a way into\r\nunexplored territory, with not uninteresting results. Many hours were\r\nspent one day by three of us in a hole that we had discovered just\r\nwithin the doorway of the cavern, a thing that had most unaccountably\r\nescaped observation hitherto, though right under our noses. The opening\r\npointed in the direction of the lower cave mouth, where the Axe comes\r\nout; but it certainly did not look very promising. Crawling in, we\r\nfound ourselves in a steeply descending passage, almost completely\r\nchoked by stones and cave earth. But at the end of the first portion it\r\nwas noticed that the floor dropped suddenly, indicating a chamber or\r\ngallery below. An afternoon was spent in the laborious task of shifting\r\nrocks, small stones, and earth, and passing up the fragments, great and\r\nsmall, from hand to hand, until they could be placed in safe positions\r\nnear the mouth of the hole. Eventually, an ancient channel through the\r\nsolid rock was disclosed, and at the end of 60 feet or so a broad low\r\nchamber appeared, floored with rocks and earth, and roofed in with\r\nsolid rock at a height of 12 or 14 inches. Pushing on, the leader\r\nspeedily found he was jammed between floor and ceiling, and could go\r\nno farther without more engineering; but an elder wand was procured,\r\na candle tied to the end of it, and this rough-and-ready torch being\r\npushed forward, it was possible to see some 35 feet ahead into the low\r\nchamber, in the depths of which a row of spiky stalactites stretched\r\nacross like an alabaster grating.\r\n\r\nTo explore this chamber thoroughly, it will be necessary to hollow out\r\na passage in the soft floor. In all likelihood, it crosses the present\r\nriver-course at a level only a few feet higher. Quantities of pottery,\r\nbones, teeth, and fragments of charcoal were found in digging out the\r\nobstacles. It seems most probable that the hole was stopped up by human\r\nagency in prehistoric ages; perhaps it was a place of sepulture. The\r\nobstacles were carefully wedged together, and their removal caused\r\nmuch difficulty. It is not pleasant to lie on one's back in a hole,\r\nwhose roof is only a few inches above one's face, and have a block of\r\nLimestone rolled from end to end of one's frame, without allowance for\r\nprojections in either. In all several tons of material were shifted and\r\ncarried out of the way. Much of the pottery had designs of a primitive\r\ncharacter worked on the surface; the more elaborate was Romano-British.\r\nConsiderable sections of amphoræ and other vessels have since been\r\npieced together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRILLE: NEW CHAMBERS, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOURCE OF THE AXE, WOOKEY HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nNext day I made a curious find at a point farther in. Where the path\r\nfrom the entrance rises over a big accumulation of rocks, just before\r\nit reaches the first great chamber, a hole in the floor had been\r\nnoticed. It had not been explored, but was waiting for someone capable\r\nof standing an exceptionally hard squeeze. The depth being uncertain, I\r\nhad a rope tied on, and after a brief struggle managed to get through\r\nthe first hole, into a crooked passage of no great length, which\r\nbrought me down to a small bell chamber. This had simply been produced\r\nby the piling up of huge quantities of rocks and stones on the floor of\r\nthe original cavern, the whole structure having since become thoroughly\r\ncemented and solidified by the growth of stalagmite. There were many\r\nteeth lying about, but the most interesting object was a wooden bowl,\r\nslightly flattened out, and resembling the top of a man's skull in\r\nshape and size. It felt soft, like a piece of cork, but was perfectly\r\nsound. What its age would be one could not tell within a century or\r\ntwo. It is now in the possession of Mr. Troup of Wells.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRENUOUS DAYS IN THE EASTWATER SWALLET\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom two to three miles north of Wookey Hole, on the top of the Mendip\r\ntableland, is a broad, shallow valley, surrounded on every side by\r\nhigher ground. It is a grey, desolate tract, with few trees dotted\r\nover its surface, but a thick belt of wood on the south, the dark\r\ngreen of which in summer, and the black stems in winter, make the grey\r\nlandscape seem the more arid, gaunt, and desolate. The ruined engine\r\nhouse of a deserted lead mine does not add to the attractiveness\r\nof the scenery. But that is soon lost to sight in the vastness of\r\nthe rolling tableland, which swells up in the distance to 1000 feet\r\nabove the sea on Pen Hill to the east, and again to the same height\r\nat Priddy Nine Barrows on North Hill, the general brown tints of the\r\nheather and bracken showing that the Old Red Sandstone comes to the\r\nsurface on these and the other saliences of the plateau. Within this\r\nshallow basin the rock is Limestone, and the causes of the existence\r\nof a valley without any visible outlet for its drainage are at once\r\nmanifest. In many places the surface of the ground is scored and pitted\r\nby innumerable depressions of diverse shapes and sizes; roundish\r\nbasins, steep funnels, craggy troughs with streams running in and\r\ndisappearing, and mere dimples, grass-lined and perfectly dry. Through\r\nthese swallets, or swallow holes, the whole of the drainage finds a\r\nvent, and all the material excavated by the forces of nature in the\r\nprocess of hollowing out this valley, has been carried off in the\r\nsame way. The work is still going on. At Eastwater a little stream,\r\nflowing down a long ravine, suddenly comes against a Limestone cliff,\r\nand begins to burrow. Less than a mile away, another stream, big enough\r\nto be called a brook, pours into a cleft in the ground and is seen no\r\nmore. This second swallow is known as Swildon's Hole, Swildon being a\r\ncorruption of Swithin. Years ago, in the course of a lawsuit, it was\r\nproved that the waters about the village of Priddy, which stands on\r\nthe edge of this upland valley, find their way into the Axe, uniting\r\ntheir streams somewhere in the heart of the hill between this point\r\nand Wookey Hole. When there were storms on the hilltop, or the upland\r\nwaters were fouled artificially, the Axe came out turbid. That the\r\narea drained by the underground Axe is a large one is proved by the\r\nsize of the river, which must be formed by the junction of a good many\r\nstreams of the volume of Eastwater and the Swildon brook. Probably that\r\narea extends as far east as Hillgrove, where a series of swallets in a\r\nwoodland ravine are now being enlarged by Mr. Balch, with a view to an\r\nexploration of the underlying caverns.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Mr. Balch's party made a descent into Swildon's Hole, and got\r\nto a depth of 300 feet below the point of absorption, which is at the\r\nsame level as the Eastwater Swallet and that at Hillgrove--that is, 780\r\nfeet above the sea. Difficulties having been put in the way of a more\r\ncomplete exploration by the owner of the field in which the swallet\r\nis situated, he turned his attention to the neighbouring stream of\r\nEastwater, which, unfortunately, runs away through holes impenetrable\r\nto man, and therefore had not promised so easy a route into the\r\nunknown. Undeterred by the obvious difficulties, Mr. Balch set to work\r\nearly in 1902, and, as he describes, made his way at last into the open\r\npassages underneath the swallet. In the course of two or three visits\r\nhe reached a point nearly 500 feet below the cave mouth, and distant\r\nabout 2000 feet in horizontal measurement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO GREAT CAVERN OF EASTWATER.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF EASTWATER CAVERN.]\r\n\r\nHe invited a large party to descend with him on March 18th, 1903, for a\r\nmore elaborate exploration. Besides the leader, Mr. Balch, experienced\r\ncave explorers came from Oxford, Derby, Holmfirth, Glastonbury, and\r\nWells. Driving up from Wells early in the morning, we donned our\r\noveralls at the mouth of the swallet. Everything was in readiness\r\nfor the adventure, and at eleven o'clock or thereabouts the first\r\nman descended the artificial hole, 20 feet deep, into the enormous\r\naccumulation of loose rocks that extends for more than 100 feet into\r\nthe head of the cavern. The blocks forming the sides of this shaft,\r\nand many of those beyond its foot, had been carefully underpinned with\r\ntimber. Everything bore witness to the labour and perseverance spent in\r\nengineering an entrance. The baggage having been let down by a rope,\r\nwe pushed on through the confusion of rocks by a maze of passages\r\nresembling the intricacies of the well-known Goatchurch Cavern, at\r\nBurrington, although the rocks, instead of being huge rectangular\r\nmasses, were shattered into the most irregular forms and sizes,\r\nleaving holes between scarce big enough for a human body to squeeze\r\nthrough. The first explorers were two hours in finding a way through\r\nthis bewildering labyrinth. Some of our men went head foremost, others\r\ncrawled on their backs with feet in front. The rocks were water-worn\r\nand jagged, and often so rotten with the action of water laden with\r\ncarbonic acid, that a finger could be thrust in up to the hilt, as into\r\nclay. We formed ourselves into a chain to hand on the luggage; this was\r\na trying business, for we were taking down more than 500 feet of rope,\r\nbesides a pick, a shovel, a bucket, various steel pulleys, an ample\r\nstock of candles, and provisions for three meals, to humour which\r\nthrough these unaccommodating passages was worse than coaxing one's own\r\nbody along. Both horizontal and vertical openings occurred here and\r\nthere, and had to be avoided carefully, one of the most important of\r\nthese being a flood-way formed by the stream entering the swallet. It\r\nwas curious to find a withy stick making desperate efforts to put forth\r\nleaves in the darkness, and succeeding in producing a long white sprout.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the noise of falling water was heard, and the leading men\r\ncalled for the rope ladder. The masses of loose rock end abruptly. To\r\nthe right a steep tunnel, called the 380-foot way, carries a small\r\nstream down; to the left is a large, irregular chamber; and beyond it,\r\nthe main passages of the cavern. The ladder being secured, each man\r\nresigned himself to the inevitable drenching, and descended into the\r\nrugged cave at the head of the 380-foot way. A camera was got down so\r\nfar, but most of the apparatus was left at the parting of the ways. Our\r\nroad was now decidedly easier. The water-channel was rugged, but the\r\nroof rose fairly high, and there were few boulders. A large tunnel,\r\ncut in the solid rock, brought down a tributary stream on the right;\r\non the other side, a horizontal tunnel was marked down for further\r\ninvestigation. The real termination of the 380-foot way has not been\r\ndiscovered. At present there is no passing beyond a choke of stones\r\nand gravel that fills it nearly to the roof; but Mr. Balch proposes to\r\nremove this.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the horizontal tunnel. It led into an extensive sloping\r\nchamber whose shape is peculiarly characteristic of this cavern.\r\nRoof and floor, roughly parallel, are inclined at an angle of fifty\r\ndegrees. For a long distance there was space to creep along under\r\nthe roof, then the space grew less, and at length the leading men\r\nshouted that they could get no farther. Being rather slighter in\r\nbuild than those who were in front, I made an effort to pass them, and\r\nsucceeded by clambering along at a higher level. A hole between some\r\nchoke-stones and a stalactite gave me admittance to a continuation of\r\nthis extraordinary chamber. Then, dropping into a dry water-channel, I\r\nwriggled downward and downward, following the noise of some dislodged\r\nstones that rattled away to a considerable depth. At last I found it\r\nimpossible to get any farther, though two more feet would have led\r\nme into a sudden widening that looked rather promising. The next man\r\nbehind was unable to get within 50 feet of this point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DESCENT OF EASTWATER CAVERN, THE SECOND VERTICAL\r\nDROP.\r\n\r\n_From Sketch by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT CANYON, EASTWATER CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_From Sketch by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\nAfter an exceedingly painful journey back to the mouth of the tunnel,\r\nwe sat down to lunch, before re-ascending the rope ladder, and carrying\r\nour baggage through a series of awkward holes and pits, all deluged\r\nwith water, into the big chamber at the head of the main passages.\r\nIn this chamber, whose walls, floor, and roof are formed of gigantic\r\nblocks seemingly on the point of collapsing, is an opening in the\r\nroof, through which a stream comes tumbling in. At the farthest corner\r\ntherefrom a large opening leads to the bottom of a chimney or aven.\r\nGreat quantities of clay on walls and roof show that this cavern has\r\nfrequently been filled with water through the choking up of the lower\r\nexit. The stream runs away into the rocky floor at the lower end of\r\nthe cave, and a few feet above it is a flood-way, a short, low tunnel,\r\nthrough which we crawled. Then begins one of the most interesting\r\nportions of the cavern. In one of those broad, low-roofed fissures,\r\ninclined at the same angle of fifty degrees as the general dip of\r\nthe strata, and formed, in fact, by the widening of a bedding-plane\r\nin the Limestone strata, a deep, winding channel has been cut by the\r\nstream we have just passed. It has been called, from its likeness, the\r\nCanyon. For a considerable distance our path lies down the Canyon,\r\nand with our heavy burdens we find the passage far from easy. As far\r\nas possible, we keep near the top of the ravine, straddling across.\r\nSometimes, however, there is no help for it but to drop right to the\r\nbottom. Before we reach its termination, we have to climb out on the\r\nsmooth, sloping floor of the main fissure, and wriggle forwards lying\r\non our sides or on our backs. Foot-hold and hand-hold being singularly\r\nscarce hereabouts, we shall find this one of the most troublesome\r\nplaces in returning. On the right, we have a glimpse through a hole\r\nhere and there of another great low-roofed fissure sloping at the same\r\nangle; then there are cross roads, with a tunnel on the left admitting\r\nto a stalactite chamber, and a passage on the right leading to the\r\nlower end of the Canyon.\r\n\r\nWe now reached the most constricted portion of the main channel. It is\r\na low, roundish tunnel, with an S curve at the distant end. A good deal\r\nof our locomotion might be likened to crawling through drain-pipes;\r\nwe were now coming to a sort of trap. The S bend has to be taken with\r\nthe body lying on its right side. Once in it, the explorer cannot turn\r\nround, since the diameter every way only just admits a human body,\r\nand the three curves are close together. My candle went out half-way\r\nthrough, and to unjam my arm and get it down for the waterproof matches\r\nwas a difficult and protracted operation. Moving the luggage through\r\nwas a very severe task, the width of the hole at one spot being only\r\nnine and a half inches.\r\n\r\nWe issued into a good-sized passage. Immediately on the left a twisting\r\nfissure went down to the head of the first perpendicular drop; but,\r\nleaving this for a while, we spent nearly an hour exploring the\r\nlofty chamber straight ahead of us. It rises to an unknown height in\r\na vertical fissure, narrowing gradually. At the bottom is a deep\r\ncutting, which some of us passed by back and knee work, at a height\r\nabove the floor. On the left, that is the eastern, wall are openings\r\ninto a parallel tunnel with good stalactites. At the far end both this\r\ntunnel and the passage itself are blocked with clay and gravel.[3] On\r\nour second visit, a day or two later, I explored a tunnel in the other\r\nwall 10 feet from the floor. It led into another of the vast sloping\r\nfissures already described, which I was too much exhausted to explore\r\nvery far. These fissures, all inclined at the same angle, and either\r\nparallel or else lying in one plane, are most impressive features of\r\nthe Eastwater Cavern; their extent is evidently enormous, and it seems\r\nas if only a few frail pillars of jammed stones served to prevent the\r\ngreat mass of the hill from settling down and crushing roof and floor\r\ntogether. On a more minute survey it may turn out that these are all\r\nportions of one huge fissure, merely partitioned off by different\r\nchokes.\r\n\r\n [3] Recently, October 1906, Mr. Balch dug through an obstruction here\r\n and entered a vast fissure chamber, which he climbed to a height of\r\n 150 feet: it has a remarkable shaft as its outlet.\r\n\r\nIt was four in the afternoon when we entered the twisting fissure\r\nleading to the first vertical descent, and two of the party had now\r\nto return. Through an oversight in not bringing a short rope for\r\nharnessing the pulley, nearly two hours were spent in rigging up the\r\ntackle, the situation being awkward for letting men down safely. We\r\nwere ensconced in a little chamber, the boulder floor of which opened\r\ninto the top of a narrow rift widening downwards, where, about 60 feet\r\nbeneath, the walls funnelled into a yawning pit 60 feet deep. This pit\r\nhad been explored previously, and was found to be choked at the bottom;\r\nit formed a safe and certain receptacle for anything lost or dislodged\r\nby persons descending the cliff above it. The configuration of our hole\r\nwas such that only one man at a time could get a steady pull on the\r\nlife-line, which ran over a pulley. A manilla rope was therefore let\r\ndown from the same belaying-pin, for a man to climb up and down by, so\r\nfar as he was able, the life-line being used merely as a safeguard. One\r\nby one the explorers dropped over into the abyss. The last three or\r\nfour had the best of it, since, with a hauling party below, full use\r\ncould be made of the pulley.\r\n\r\nWe were now drawing nigh to the final tug of war. A quarter of an hour\r\nof indescribable wriggling brought us to a narrow and lofty rift, into\r\nwhich as many of the party as it would accommodate wedged themselves,\r\nright over the second vertical drop. Much the same tactics were\r\nresorted to here, save that, instead of a fixed pulley, each man in\r\nturn had a large steel pulley belted to him, through which ran 200 feet\r\nof rope, one end fixed to a wedged boulder beneath us, the other end\r\nin the hands of the hauling party. A 90-foot manilla was, as before,\r\nallowed to hang free, as a guide-rope, over the crags, and enabled each\r\nman to do something for himself and assist those above. Only four men\r\nessayed this last descent.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic cavity into which we now dropped is one of the most savage\r\nand impressive things it has ever been my lot to see. At the top,\r\nover the heads of the hauling party, it runs up into the rocky mass\r\nof the hill as a vertical chimney, under the mouth of which lay what\r\nappeared to be a deep black pit. We alighted, one by one, on a sloping\r\nshelf that traversed the side of the cavity at a considerable height.\r\nCreeping along this ledge, we saw at the end of it a huge cavernous\r\nopening descending into darkness, with a mighty rock wedged across it\r\nlike a bridge. The black, gaunt walls on each side of us were craggy\r\nand rifted; their surfaces glistened with streaming water. Our ledge\r\nending abruptly, we dropped, hand over hand, on the rope, to the edge\r\nof a large pothole, into which a stream was rushing. At this point a\r\ntunnel goes off to the left, and, as it had not been explored, I was\r\nasked by Mr. Balch to proceed down it. Two of us crept and clambered\r\nand slid down a very dirty watercourse, till, at a distance of perhaps\r\n50 yards, we found ourselves atop of a high clay bank, closely overhung\r\nby rocks, with a stream rumbling along to the south-south-west. I got\r\nwithin 10 feet of the water, but without a rope to get us up again\r\nwe would not venture farther. We had now been in the cave nine and a\r\nhalf hours, and were too much fatigued to undertake new work. It was\r\nascertained, beyond reasonable doubt, that a fine series of potholes\r\nthat exist in the continuation of the great cavity must drain into the\r\nstream just discovered. Beyond those potholes, to pass which involves\r\nmuch hard work, is another cavity, and beyond that what?--at present no\r\none can tell. All we know is, that the water finds its way ultimately\r\ninto the vast reservoirs inside Wookey Hole; but whether there are\r\nother vast cavities, or merely narrow crevices and impassable clefts\r\nbetween, is a question that will require labours almost Herculean to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nIn scrambling back along the ledge in the big cavity I gave the\r\nfinal shove to a dangerous loose rock weighing something like six\r\nhundredweight. It fell into the ravine beneath, and hurtled onwards\r\ntoward the chain of potholes, making the whole grim place ring with a\r\ncrash of echoes. It took us two hours and a half to return to the cave\r\nmouth, although we were unencumbered with apparatus, for we had left\r\nthe ropes and pulleys in place for another descent. Getting seven men\r\nup the higher of the two vertical pitches was a tough undertaking at\r\nthe end of an arduous day, and when we returned through the famous S\r\ntunnel more than one explorer seemed disposed to snatch a sleep on its\r\nprocrustean bed. We had been twelve hours underground when we revisited\r\nthe glimpses of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt had been proposed to continue the exploration next day, but no one\r\nwas fit for such a repetition of exhausting labours. The day following,\r\na party of three was mustered to recover the apparatus that had been\r\nleft in the depths. Two of us reached the head of the nethermost pitch,\r\nand after hours of severe work got everything up to the mouth of the\r\nswallet. Once more we drove back over Mendip in the dark. All around\r\nus on the desolate plateau was impenetrable gloom, but in the northern\r\nsky, and it seemed but a few miles away, the lights of Bath and Bristol\r\nflared across the heavens like two immense conflagrations. Never does\r\none feel the sublimity of the open, windy earth, the starry sky, and\r\nthe free sense of space, so profoundly as after striving for a long\r\nday to break through the barriers that shut us out from the regions of\r\nmystery under the hills.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWILDON'S HOLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn insignificant crevice, a hole scarcely wide enough to tempt a dog\r\nor fox, alone gives admittance to what is perhaps the wildest and\r\nmost magnificent cavern in Britain. Swildon's Hole, it has already\r\nbeen stated, lies at the same level, 780 feet above the sea, as the\r\nEastwater Swallet and that of Hill Grove. It lies in a separate trough,\r\nwithin the same basin as the Eastwater stream, with whose waters it\r\nunites somewhere in the bowels of the rocky hills, to flow out of\r\nWookey Hole as the river Axe, of which it may be considered as the\r\nprincipal feeder. A few years ago the actual swallet was visible,\r\nthe brooklet running away into holes under a bank of earth and rock\r\ncrowned with foliage. More recently, in order to make a small fish\r\npond, the landowner has made a dam above the swallet, which is entirely\r\nconcealed by this means, an entrance remaining, however, into the maze\r\nof cavities and waterways through a narrow crevice at the side. Mr.\r\nBalch was the first person to recognise the importance of Swildon's\r\nHole as a chief feeder of the Axe, and in 1901 he made preparations to\r\nexplore it. But through some delay, three members of his party were the\r\nfirst to enter the cave, without him--namely, Messrs. Troup and H. and\r\nF. Hiley. A short while after, Mr. Balch was able to carry out a more\r\nextended exploration. Then for some time no one entered the swallet,\r\nwhich gradually became choked with stones and litter brought down by\r\nthe stream. Very few had ever heard of the cave, and hardly anyone\r\nrealised that one of the most beautiful pieces of underground scenery\r\nin Britain was lying there unseen, and one of the most important of\r\nhydrological problems remaining quite unsolved.\r\n\r\nThe next visit took place about Christmas 1904. Mr. Troup, who had been\r\none of the first in the cave, took the lead of our party. My other\r\ncompanions were Messrs. Bamforth and E. E. Barnes, but we expected to\r\nbe joined some hours later by Mr. Balch and Mr. Slater.\r\n\r\nWhen the first explorers entered this cavern some little while ago,\r\nthey met with serious difficulties owing to the presence of ancient\r\nchokes or dams that held back pools of water, but they were assisted\r\nby the dryness of the weather. We, on the contrary, made our descent\r\nafter a period of heavy rains, and the volume of water that accompanied\r\nus down was twentyfold as great. We had one advantage, however: the\r\noriginal discoverers were with us to point the way. With luggage\r\nreduced to a minimum, two ropes, plenty of illuminants, food, and\r\ntwo cameras, we passed through the uninviting entrance, and attacked\r\nmethodically a close-packed mass of débris that had been washed into a\r\nnarrow gut since the former visit.\r\n\r\nWhilst we lay at work, the sound of falling water in the depths below\r\nbroke on our ears, a musical but ominous salutation. The obstacle\r\nwasted two hours of valuable time. Wriggling through at last, feet\r\nforemost, our legs came out over the rift, a narrow chasm some 20 feet\r\ndeep, with the head stream of the cavern tumbling in over a choke-stone\r\nat one end. Our goods were let down carefully into the hands of the\r\nfirst man, who lodged them in a sheltered spot whilst we scrambled\r\nhastily down through showers of spray. Now began a painful advance into\r\nthe depths. Along the tilted bedding planes, down the perpendicular\r\njoints of the Limestone, widened by the water into broad, low chambers\r\nand deep shafts and canyons, we forged ahead, hugging the stream, which\r\ngrew larger and angrier as tributaries came swishing in from walls and\r\nroof. At one point the water swept horizontally along a straight canal,\r\nbut was stopped at the end by a recent choke, and now tumbled through a\r\nhole in the wall into a huge pothole. Through this lay our road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE OF SWILDON'S HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by M. Martel._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERFALL, SWILDON'S HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\nThe water poured down a staircase of similar basins, where to keep\r\nclear of the stream was impossible. So far we had kept tolerably dry,\r\nbut as we clung to this watery ladder I pricked up my ears at the\r\nremark, \"Will you have your back or your stomach in it?\" Crouching on\r\nall fours, with back pressed against the low roof, and looking between\r\nmy legs, I watched the performances of my comrades, as each in turn\r\nwent through the final archway. Not one escaped a severe wetting.\r\nBut I was going to be more wily--at least, I thought so. With hands\r\nand knees in the rushing stream, I squirmed hastily but cautiously\r\nthrough. I seemed to be getting on famously, and gave a spurt. That\r\nmoment the rocks ended; they were undercut. I found myself sliding\r\ndown a waterfall 10 feet high, and floundering in a big pool at the\r\nbottom. Drenched we were; but what better preparation could we have for\r\nthe troubles ahead? This part of the cavern shows traces of enormous\r\nchanges in the course of the stream, which has planed down great masses\r\nof stalagmite, the growth of ages, when this section of the tunnels was\r\ndry or all but deserted by the streams, which found a way down by the\r\nhorizontal canal or some higher channel. Between this first water-chute\r\nand the second lies the most nerve-trying part of the journey to the\r\nfarthest point hitherto attained. It is a succession of lofty rifts,\r\ngiving into each other at right angles, the water sweeping from one to\r\nthe next through curving fissures and sudden falls. For a while we kept\r\nabove the canyons on a water-worn shelf, all that remained of a low,\r\nflattish chamber that sufficed for the small streams of older times.\r\nThis giving out, we scrambled along the cliffs of the canyons, which\r\nseemed in the gloom without top or bottom, bestraddling the rift, or\r\nwith feet on one side and back to the other pushing on from hold to\r\nhold. The Limestone grips would have been amply sufficient for this\r\nmode of progression had they not been drenched and slippery. Below us\r\nthe waters raced and bellowed. At the junctions of the canyons they\r\nsounded on all sides at once; the invisible hollows all round seemed\r\nto be alive with angry voices, mad to be at us. What if a thunderstorm\r\nburst over Mendip now? Such thoughts would occur, although we knew we\r\ncould climb into safety on the upper shelves of the canyon; for with a\r\nwater-chute above and another below, a little flood would make us fast\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAt the Well, the stream tumbles suddenly into a deep round pit, in\r\nwhich it is churned to foam before being driven out with accelerated\r\nspeed along a rugged gorge to the second staircase of potholes. Shreds\r\nof magnesium ribbon dropped into the Well lit up such a turmoil of\r\nwaters as one might see in some gigantic turbine going at full speed.\r\nTwo of us now went ahead to report on the condition of the next stage.\r\nThe gorge was too wide for climbing, but we found a footing on the\r\nrocks in the bed, then squirmed through a narrow fissure, and began to\r\ndescend the potholes. These were deep basins, with high walls on the\r\nupper side where the stream poured in, and the other side broken down\r\nby the force of the torrent. Below them lay the second water-chute,\r\na big fall pitching into a hole underneath a low arch, and sliding\r\nout into a turbulent pool. It was a sort of culvert, with very little\r\nhead-room above the water. Had we not come through so many tribulations\r\nalready, and had we not known of the glories that awaited us in the\r\ngreat stalactite chamber beyond this last trial, we should certainly\r\nhave been turned back by this obstacle. After some little hesitation\r\nwe resolved to attempt it, and went back to the head of the Well for\r\nour companions. One of the cameras had already been left behind; it was\r\ndecided to leave the other here. The leader went down the water-chute\r\non his back; the rest adopted all the other attitudes possible short\r\nof a complete header. But it made little difference; all got a most\r\neffectual drenching.\r\n\r\nRunning the gauntlet beneath another tributary, which came swishing\r\nin just over our heads, we pushed on into a high and ample chamber,\r\nwhere in times gone by a volume of water had accumulated in a sort of\r\ngigantic cistern. The rocky roof was flat and smooth, its cracks and\r\nfissures fringed with meandering lacework of stalactite. In front,\r\nthe rocky mole that once held up the reservoir was cloven into a\r\nseries of Limestone seracs, between which the stream found its way\r\ndown into the remoter cavities. Masses of clay, some 15 feet thick,\r\ndeposited by the ancient waters, still flanked this rugged portal\r\ninto the unknown. Bones of sheep, cattle, horses, and lesser mammals\r\nlay about in profusion, enough to reconstruct whole skeletons; with\r\nthem were the relics of animals now extinct on Mendip, deer and other\r\ncreatures. Higher up sherds of Samian pottery had been found, brought\r\ndown by the stream from the rubbish heaps of long ago. What struck the\r\nimagination as still more wonderful was that in this sunless spot, 300\r\nfeet below the surface, there were creatures that lived. Empty snail\r\nshells were abundant, but yet more plentiful were tiny snails that were\r\nactually crawling over the clay, feeding, no doubt, on water-borne\r\nvegetable matter. Gossamer-like webs stretched across many chinks in\r\nthe Limestone, but the microscopic spiders we could not see. What flies\r\ndid they live on? Surely not the caddis, whose corpses lay about in\r\nplenty on every shoal.\r\n\r\nFrom this chamber the stream quickly descends into the great Water\r\nRift, one of the most wonderful things in the whole cavern. It is but\r\na few feet wide, but its height is enormous. The walls go up like\r\nmountain cliffs, but are lost in gloom instead of mist. Here tremendous\r\nchanges had taken place since the former exploration. At that time\r\nthe rift was blocked up in one place by a vast barrage of rock and\r\nstalagmite, that came down to the stream and forbade human progress\r\nsave by one strait and difficult way. At a height above the water a\r\nhole ascended seven feet into the barrier, its orifice all but closed\r\nby a fringe of stalactites. Contriving to enter, the explorers crept\r\nup this pipe, and down a corresponding one on the other side, coming\r\nout on a cliff face overhanging the continuation of the Water Rift, to\r\nattain the bottom of which was an abstruse gymnastic problem. A little\r\nfarther on they reached the utmost limit of their journey, where the\r\nstream beats violently against the termination of the rift, is hurled\r\nsideways, and finds an outlet through a low crevice, whence it tumbles\r\nin a 40-foot cataract into an unknown pool. Our main object to-day had\r\nbeen to descend this 40-foot pitch; that was the reason why we had\r\nencumbered ourselves with two long ropes. But now all was different.\r\nIn the short interval that had elapsed since the former visit, the\r\nstrength of the ungovernable torrent had swept away the whole of this\r\nvast structure, the work of thousands of ages--for the Pyramids are\r\nrecent erections compared with these products of unimaginably slow\r\ncrystallisation. Hardly a vestige remained; and now the current dashed\r\nunimpeded from end to end of the Water Rift, and the incessant thunder\r\nof the cataract deafened ears already attuned to the noise of the\r\nhigher falls and canyons. Probably the removal of stones and dams by\r\nthe former party, in making their way down, had contributed largely to\r\nthis extraordinary event.\r\n\r\nNothing could be done in the face of such a volume of water. We turned,\r\naccordingly, out of the main passage into a lofty gallery or transept\r\nthat branches off to the west, the general direction of the cavern\r\nbeing due south. To say it branches off is slightly incorrect, for it\r\nis really the course of a tributary brook, and quite possibly may have\r\nbeen in remote times the channel of the main stream. At all events\r\nits shape and magnitude indicate that it was once a very important\r\nsection of the cavern. Scrambling cautiously along the sides of the\r\ntoppling fragments of the mole, we crossed a deep gap and entered the\r\ngallery. At the portal a great hollow corbel of stalactite stood out\r\nfrom the wall, like an enormous stoup, its huge rims curved over like\r\nthe petals of a flower. It stood there in solitary grandeur, but it was\r\na token of transcendent glories beyond. A few more steps, and we saw\r\nthat we were on the threshold of a fane more beautiful than any made\r\nwith hands. The rocks to right and left were sheeted with crystalline\r\nenamel, its surface powdered thickly with a minute splash deposit, so\r\nfrail that it gave one a twinge to crush the lovely efflorescence as\r\nwe moved. One could not go a step without destroying hundreds of these\r\ndelicate spicules, the work of untold ages of water action. More great\r\ncorbels stood out from the walls as we advanced; they were richly\r\nmoulded with concentric rings of stalagmite, and these again were\r\ncarved and chased with wonderful reliefs. From the corbels sprang huge\r\npillars right to the roof, pillars 40 feet in height; and from their\r\ncapitals shining curtains hung down in ample folds, heavy as Parian\r\nmarble, and as lovely in hue. One would have called them white, had\r\nwe not seen, hanging from a cleft high up in the lofty walls, a mass\r\nof curtains as white as arragonite, the whitest thing there is. So\r\ndazzling was their immaculate purity that the rich creamy surface of\r\nthe other incrustations showed dusky in comparison. We were veteran\r\ncave explorers, yet it seemed to us that all the caves we had ever\r\nseen in Britain could no more vie with this than parish churches\r\nwith cathedrals. At each turn there was a new and more enthralling\r\nvista: more pillars, ampler curtains, piers and arches of Oriental\r\nmagnificence, fluted and moulded into wildest fantasies. It struck one\r\nwith a curious wonder to think that all these splendours had lain here\r\nunbeheld by living eye, untouched by a gleam of light, until one casual\r\nyear in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nBut the photographer was exercised by other feelings. He was here, but\r\nwhere was his camera? It had seemed a Herculean labour to bring that\r\nmuch-enduring instrument down to the 300-foot level, but he declared\r\nthat the task was not superhuman, and, furthermore, he was determined\r\nto do it. He could not do it alone, however; that was obvious. The\r\nexpedition, therefore, came down out of the stalactite gallery. Two\r\nwent through the water-chute, two remained just outside it, to assist\r\nin the last and most dangerous stage of the transportation. We waited\r\na long time; in fact, we had leisure enough to explore an interesting\r\nside gallery whilst the others made their way to and from the head\r\nof the Well. At last their welcome shout was heard. Standing in the\r\nwater, with light held low under the arch, we caught sight of a hand,\r\nand then of a wading and much-crumpled-up man, lugging the camera,\r\nwhich he kept out of the foaming water with admirable skill. We grabbed\r\nit, and put the precious instrument in a place of safety; ten minutes\r\nlater the flashlight was at work, taking our breath away with its\r\ngorgeous revelations. The photographer had his troubles even here,\r\nthough not such as to be compared with those of the water caverns\r\nwe had recently traversed, where at this moment two of our party,\r\nfollowing us down, were engaged in photographing the canyons and the\r\nfalls, under difficulties that few cameras have ever been confronted\r\nwith. Here there was no marble pavement suitable to the splendours\r\nof the walls; nothing for the camera to stand on but an inch or two\r\nof slippery ledge, with a depth of mud in the middle that none of us\r\ncared to fathom. The only place that could be found at one spot for the\r\nflashlight was the top of my unfortunate head, which I generously put\r\nat the photographer's disposal. On it was laid a piece of stone, on\r\nwhich the gun-cotton was spread and sprinkled with the powder, which,\r\nwhen it went off, made me shut both eyes for fear of the shower of\r\nsparks, and so I missed the glorious blaze of light that illumined the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE OF STALACTITE CHAMBER, SWILDON'S HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE CURTAINS, SWILDON'S HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nThese stately columns, soaring vaults, and sweeping marble draperies\r\nwere strangely out of proportion to the narrowness of the place. But\r\nnow the sinuous aisle broadened out, and the style of the architecture\r\nwas changed entirely. We were at the junction chamber where, in the\r\nremote past, two big streams came down from the yawning passages to\r\nthe left and right, and met here, probably as the main stream of the\r\ncavern. The roof is a spacious dome, hung with resplendent candelabra.\r\nBut the unique feature of the place, the thing that impresses itself on\r\nthe memory as one of the most dazzling creations of the wonder-working\r\ncalcite, is the stalagmite bridge. Bridge, I say, but it is more than\r\na bridge, for its complicated arches support a beautiful piazza, with\r\na huge array of dripstone terraces, crystal basins, massive pedestals,\r\nand obelisks of stalagmite, which all but fills the chamber and extends\r\nsome distance up the alcoves behind. Standing on one of the great\r\nhemispheres of dripstone, one could put one's head among the pendulous\r\nshafts above, and see how each was marvellously twisted, moulded, and\r\nfantastically embossed and gemmed with flashing crystals. The splash\r\nformation covered everything beneath the roof, save portions of the\r\npolished floor, with millions of tiny spicules. We had to move about\r\ncautiously, not only for fear of doing damage, but to avoid gaping\r\npitfalls in the bridge, the surface of which was smooth as ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE CHAMBER, SWILDON'S HOLE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nWhilst we were at work photographing a distant shout was heard, and\r\nsoon the two men who had followed us down arrived at the big chamber.\r\nBut our party was again reduced to its original four by the departure\r\nof two other members, who were to go back by the aquatic route in order\r\nto pick up certain articles that had been deposited on the way down. We\r\nourselves hoped to get to the surface by another and a drier course.\r\nAt the previous exploration two men had missed the rest of the party,\r\nand found their way, after divers adventures, through the ramifications\r\nof the cavern, to what they described as a great stalactite chamber,\r\nwhich was presumably our gallery. When they reached it, however, no\r\none was there, nor any trace of human presence; either the explorers\r\nhad finished their work and departed, or the pair had missed their way\r\naltogether. It was believed that they had come down to this very spot\r\nby the gallery joining this one on the north, and we purposed following\r\nthat passage out. But this, as we presently discovered, was all wrong.\r\n\r\nTwo of us now went off on an exploring trip into the great passage\r\nrunning west. At once we encountered a series of huge obstructions.\r\nThis passage was of the usual rift pattern, and, save for holes and\r\ncrevices between, was wholly blocked up by large masses of tumbled\r\nrocks. One of us climbed to the top of the Cyclopean pile, whilst I\r\nattempted to make my way along at the middle height, but eventually\r\nfound it easier to crawl through the culverts and water-gaps,\r\nregardless of mud and wet. Even among the piled-up rocks there were\r\ncharming little nooks adorned with rich incrustations. When the rocks\r\nended the open tunnel began to ascend rapidly; then, after a while, we\r\ncame to another tunnel joining it on the north. This, though smaller,\r\nwas the more important passage; the other shortly came to an end in\r\na lofty grotto, bountifully tapestried with curtains and tassels of\r\nstalactite. We climbed the northern passage, through several brilliant\r\ndisplays of incrustation, and reached a level approximately 70 feet\r\nbelow the surface, by aneroid; there we could get no farther. But,\r\nunknown to ourselves, we had brought back important information.\r\n\r\nWe had noticed mysterious bits of string at two points in this series.\r\nWhen we reported the discovery to the two men left behind, they at once\r\nsaw its significance. The two men whose route down to the stalactite\r\nchamber had caused so much perplexity had used a ball of string to mark\r\ntheir way out--these were the relics. Our casual trip had, perhaps,\r\nsaved us from a night of blind wandering in the unknown branches of the\r\ngreat tunnel on the north. All being in readiness for our departure, we\r\nnow proceeded to take up this providential thread. It was not an easy\r\ntask. Often not an inch of string remained undecayed for many hundreds\r\nof feet together, and often we nosed the walls and floor, eagerly but\r\nin vain, for droppings of candle grease left by our predecessors.\r\nThe way was dry, that was a relief, after six or seven hours in wet\r\nclothes; but it was a tighter squeeze than the other, and the sharpness\r\nof the turns was often aggravated by a portcullis of crystals on our\r\nbacks, and a _cheval de frise_ of stalagmite spear-heads against our\r\nstomachs. All the while we wondered whether we should really find the\r\nexit, or whether we should have to return and undertake the canyons\r\nafter all. Mr. Balch compared our task of finding the desired exit\r\nto an attempt to ascend from the mouth of a river to some unknown\r\npoint upon one of its tributaries, with nothing to indicate which way\r\nto take. This puts the position clearly enough, I think. There was\r\nno string to be found in the higher parts. At last the man in front\r\ndisappeared feet foremost through the ugliest hole we had yet seen, out\r\nof which the noise of waters sounded ominously. A cheering cry came\r\nback to us; he had found the rift, where we had descended seven hours\r\nago into the route through the canyons. A few more yards of determined\r\nwriggling, and the candle left by the other two men hove in sight. We\r\nfound they had got out two hours ago. The stars were shining from a\r\nclear sky, and a keen frost was on the fields, but the excitement and\r\nthe success of our adventure were stimulant enough to keep out the cold.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CAVERN AT CHEDDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of our researches at Cheddar has been the discovery\r\nof the underground river-course. Not many yards below the entrance to\r\nGough's, or the Great Cavern, a large body of water wells up at the\r\nfoot of a cliff, spreading out into a beautiful mere, half encircled\r\nby crags; flows on thence through the village, performing a great deal\r\nof industrial work on its way; and, finally, proceeds a mile or two\r\nfarther as the Cheddar Water, to join its brother, the Axe, which has\r\na similar origin. But less is known about the darksome course of the\r\nCheddar Water than about the stream flowing out of Wookey Hole. With\r\nits tributaries, it has doubtless been the principal agent in the\r\nformation, not only of the caves, but also of the famous Cheddar gorge,\r\nwhich bears every evidence of having been produced by the gradual\r\ndestruction of a series of caverns. Yet this important stream has\r\nactually not been met with hitherto at any single point of its course\r\nunderground, and we have anything but complete information as to its\r\nsources on the uplands of Mendip. The owners of the Great Cavern, the\r\nMessrs. Gough Brothers, tell me that they intend to blast away about\r\n10 feet of rock immediately overlying the exit of the river. When the\r\nstream is very full, water often bursts forth here from cracks and\r\njoints several feet above the normal level, and they imagine that\r\nthere must be a chamber of some height just within. This, however,\r\nin my opinion, is not a necessary inference, since every cavity and\r\ncrevice behind the outlet would at such times be heavily charged with\r\nwater, under pressure, and the large cavities might be a long way back.\r\nIt is curious that the water in a low tunnel recently discovered in\r\nCox's Cavern, which lies some distance from Gough's, and at a lower\r\nlevel, rises and falls in unison with the movements of the water-level\r\nof the river outside, although that always remains 10 feet higher.\r\nCox's Cavern is occasionally flooded, yet the water never rises to a\r\npoint within 10 feet of the river level. Obviously the subterranean\r\nconnection must be of a complicated and roundabout form.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my first serious attempt to explore the caves of\r\nCheddar, when our party contained Dr. Norman Sheldon, Mr. J. O.\r\nMorland, and Mr. Harry Bamforth, two of whom have not since been able\r\nto join us in Somerset, I had not the advantage of knowing Mr. H. E.\r\nBalch, and we were utterly unaware of the great work he had been doing\r\nin the cave region adjoining Wells. On the other hand, we received\r\ninvaluable assistance from the brothers Gough, who are not only\r\nproprietors of show caves, but take a sincere interest in underground\r\nexploration. Their father, who died in 1902, was the discoverer of the\r\ncaverns that bear his name, and was actively at work pushing his way\r\nfarther and farther into the rocky bosom of the hill up to the year of\r\nhis death, at a good old age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALAGMITE PILLARS IN GOUGH'S GREAT CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Gough, Cheddar._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PILLARS OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, GOUGH'S CAVES, CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Gough, Cheddar._]\r\n\r\nThe Great Cavern was discovered in 1898. The parts open to visitors\r\nextend in a generally easterly direction for some 600 yards, and\r\nconsist of natural chambers and passages, connected here and there\r\nby artificial tunnels. We began work early in the morning, carrying\r\ninto the cavern a large quantity of ropes, ladders of wood and rope,\r\nand plenty of illuminants, including a 2000-candle-power limelight,\r\nwhich with its lens or condenser is one of the most valuable aids in\r\nsubterranean work. Many openings are seen overhead and in the walls\r\nof the cavern as the visitor advances, some of which end abruptly,\r\nwhilst others lead into small grottos and galleries. One of the most\r\nconspicuous chimneys, or perpendicular caves, has at its base a\r\npeculiar staircase of stalagmitic basins, formed by the deposits of\r\na calcareous spring that is now dried up. These basins are known as\r\nthe \"Fonts.\" Our conductors had been in the habit of climbing about\r\n50 feet up this lofty chasm, over the crust of stalagmite, and a wire\r\nrope had been fixed to assist visitors in ascending to a broad, deep\r\nledge. Above this point the rocks were much steeper. No one had ever\r\nsucceeded in seeing the top, and at first we thought it would be\r\nimpossible to ascend any higher without some sort of apparatus. We sent\r\nfor a ladder, and meanwhile Dr. Sheldon and I tried to clamber over\r\nthe jutting arch of rock that formed the first obstacle--a cave-pitch\r\nin a gully or chimney we should call it in climbing parlance. To our\r\nsurprise, we succeeded in reaching the continuous channel or gutter\r\nabove it, which ascended at a high angle, with sheer walls to right\r\nand left, and the other side of the huge shaft overhanging it. The\r\nholds were shallow and slippery, and with one hand grasping a candle we\r\nfound the ordinary difficulties of a rock-climb multiplied enormously.\r\nHalf-way up my candle went out, but my companion was now well ahead,\r\nand I groped my way after him with confidence. When a shout from below\r\nannounced that the ladder had been hoisted up to the platform above the\r\n\"Fonts\" we were within a few yards of the top. At a height of 120 feet\r\n(by the aneroid) above this platform and of 170 feet above the floor\r\nof the cavern we found the shaft completely blocked up with débris and\r\nclay. We were in a subterranean pot, or swallet, of large dimensions,\r\nformed in remote ages by a big stream, which had worked through its\r\nLimestone bed, and continued its path at a deeper level. Whether this\r\nwas the main stream that now flows in an unknown course hundreds of\r\nfeet below, or only a tributary, it is at present impossible to tell.\r\nMr. Bamforth's limelight was now projected up the chasm, revealing\r\ngrand masses of superincumbent rock on the farther side, whilst the\r\nview downwards, past our friends into the dark bottom of the pit, was\r\nvery curious. Roping ourselves together for the descent, we kept near\r\neach other for fear of a slip, and took the utmost precautions not to\r\ndislodge any stones on the heads of those underneath. The limelight\r\nwas a great advantage, although many dark reaches had to be carefully\r\ninspected with a taper before we could secure foothold. When we got to\r\nthe critical bit at the bottom we found the ladder placed ready for us.\r\n\r\nNot far from the entrance to the \"Fonts\" is the mouth of a low passage\r\non the other side, with a hole at the far end of it, that our guides\r\nthought must communicate with the underground river which, they\r\nconjecture, has its channel not far below this spot. We crawled into\r\nthis burrow and fixed ourselves in the confined space round the black\r\npit, which we found, by throwing in stones, had water in it. With a\r\nrope round my waist I climbed down the fissure, whose sides were of\r\nsharply corrugated rock though they looked like wet clay. About 30 feet\r\ndown the hole grew so narrow that I could not turn round; I could just\r\nreach the water with my foot, but found that it was quite a small pool.\r\nAnother \"well,\" nearer the cave mouth, was explored after our further\r\noperations had been carried out. It was situated at the extremity of\r\nanother burrow, but was much larger in circumference. Steadied by the\r\nrope, I climbed to the bottom and found a large pool of great depth\r\nabout 30 feet below the edge. No current was perceptible, and its\r\nconnection with running water is hardly probable. Some years later,\r\na perfect skeleton of a man was exhumed from the clay beneath the\r\nstalagmite in this burrow; accompanying it were numerous flint flakes.\r\nSome peculiarities indicate that the find was that of a man of early\r\nNeolithic age. It is shown by the Gough Brothers at the entrance of\r\ntheir cave.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the party were photographing the \"show place,\" a lofty\r\ndome-shaped cavern with its sheet of stalagmite poured over the cliff\r\nlike a petrified waterfall, two of us retraced our steps from \"St.\r\nPaul's,\" as this beautiful sight is nicknamed, to the branch leading to\r\nthe other principal shows. \"Solomon's Temple\" is a wonderful grotto,\r\nwalled, roofed, and floored with gleaming white and ivory calcite, and\r\nset at the top of another great fall of stalagmite which has flowed\r\non and on in a gentle stream and covered the floor of a lofty cavern\r\nwith dimpling waves of crystal. Nor are these all its attractions, for\r\non turning round the spectator sees on the opposite cliff a broad and\r\nvoluminous sheet of stalagmite, rippling down, spouting and foaming\r\nover the rocks like a waterfall, but still as marble and white as\r\nfrozen snow. We had seen all these things before, however, and were\r\nanxious to move on to new ground again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORGAN PIPES, GOUGH'S CAVES, CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Gough, Cheddar._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STALAGMITE FALL, GOUGH'S CAVE, CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by M. Martel._]\r\n\r\nIn the fork between the main passage and this big cavern is a large\r\nirregular opening, with disorderly blocks of Limestone heaped up on\r\nits floor. We picked our way across these, and at a height of 40 feet\r\nreached the edge of an abrupt rock some four yards high. We dropped\r\nover on to an earthy floor, and going a little farther found ourselves\r\nin a domical chamber with three low exits. First of all exploring\r\nthat on our left, we had a look at a slanting shaft filled with a\r\n\"ruckle\" of big shattered blocks wedged insecurely, above which are\r\ntwo small chambers incrusted with stalagmite, but with no apparent\r\nexit. We climbed down again, and tried the third opening. It led\r\nthrough a series of caves and narrow clefts into a larger chamber,\r\nall maintaining the same easterly direction, and there we found two\r\npossible ways onward. The first of these brought us in a few moments\r\nto the brink of a steep cliff, which seemed to be one wall of a\r\nconsiderable cavern. We preferred to wait for the limelight before\r\nventuring to let a man down into this unknown abyss, and meanwhile\r\nto examine the other passage. A few minutes' crawling brought us to\r\na great pit, which sounded very deep when we threw in some fragments\r\nof rock. Apparently it was the chasm that had been described to us as\r\n300 feet deep by one of our guides who had descended part of the way.\r\nWe approached the edge with respect, and as a preliminary step let\r\ndown a rope ladder into the upper part, which is strangely twisted. At\r\na depth of 20 feet I found a possible landing-place; the second man\r\njoined me, and by dint of careful manoeuvring the third got down to\r\nthe same spot. With an 80-foot rope tied on, I now explored the next\r\nsection of the chasm, and was delighted to find that there was just\r\nenough rope to reach a slope of big rocks at the bottom. A little more\r\nscrambling brought me into a vast chamber, the floor of which was piled\r\nup with enormous blocks, while the lowest part seemed to offer two\r\npossible routes onwards. One of these proved to be a mere hollow, but\r\nthe other was evidently the channel of a stream, and apparently led\r\nonwards into further caves. But the roof was extremely low, and it was\r\nquite impossible to wriggle through. One of my companions, who had now\r\njoined me, also failed to squeeze through the opening, and we decided\r\nto leave it until the hole could be enlarged with pick and shovel.\r\nThe alleged 300 feet was found by aneroid to be exactly 100 feet. In\r\na corner of this lofty cavern was a steep fissure which seemed to be\r\nwell worth exploring. The bottom half of it was completely walled in\r\nby an enormous flake of Limestone that had come down from the roof,\r\nand looked as if a touch would send it tumbling on the heaps of rock\r\nat the bottom of the cave. We scrambled up the fissure at the back of\r\nthis, and reached a promising gallery; but, to our disgust, this was\r\nentirely blocked up with clay and mud at the top, and it was impossible\r\nto proceed. Gaining the summit of the huge Limestone flake, we lit up\r\nthe cave with magnesium wire, and were deeply impressed by its height\r\nand the grandeur of the shattered crags bristling on walls, roof,\r\nand floor. Everything was black, save one long, dripping cascade of\r\nstalagmite on the wall over against us; its unsullied whiteness shone\r\nweirdly out of the gloom as the fierce light fell on it. Just at that\r\nmoment voices were heard, and from a rent in the rocky wall in front\r\nthe intolerable beam of the searchlight came right in our faces. The\r\nremainder of the party had followed us up, and reached the spot where\r\nwe had first looked over into the deep chasm. Revealed in all its\r\nextent by this penetrating light, the cave reminded us strongly of\r\nthe enormous chamber that we had explored a few months earlier in the\r\nlowest part of the Blue John Mine in Derbyshire. On the way back one of\r\nthe acetylene lamps fell down the pit by which we had entered, and was\r\ncompletely smashed. With no other mishap, we made our way through the\r\ntortuous passages and amongst the chaos of tumbled rock masses back to\r\nthe cavern under \"Solomon's Temple.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of us explored the openings above \"St. Paul's\" a few days later. A\r\n30-foot ladder was placed against the corner of the stalagmite fall,\r\nand a yard or two of scrambling took us to the top. On the left was an\r\nascending vault, with openings to right and left. Taking the latter\r\nto begin with, we found it gradually trend downhill and dwindle away\r\ninto a series of holes scarcely big enough to let a human body pass.\r\nSqueezing through with a good deal of trouble, I reached a flattish\r\ncave with a floor of rock and stalagmite all cracked and fissured.\r\nThe whole of this part seemed to have been shivered by some large\r\nmovement of the rocky strata. One of the fissures gave entrance to a\r\npassage underneath the floor; but this speedily narrowed, and when\r\nit was impossible to get farther I found myself right underneath my\r\ncompanion, who was holding my rope and paying it out as I advanced\r\nfrom his original position in the outer passage. No other exit being\r\ndiscoverable on this side, we crossed to the passage on the right, and\r\nafter a few yards of crawling under a depressed roof we found ourselves\r\non the largest expanse of stalagmite either of us had ever met with.\r\nIt had flowed down from fissures high up on our left and spread over\r\na wide, rocky slope; it had then contracted and poured over a cliff\r\nimmediately on our right. We still kept the rope taut, and moved about\r\ncautiously, for the crystalline floor was extremely slippery, and the\r\ncliff immediately beneath us would have made the slightest accident\r\nserious. A broad flat roof of rock overhung the floor of stalagmite\r\nclosely, and was covered with thin pipes and reeds of stalactite. We\r\nsoon ascertained that we had returned by a different route to the crown\r\nof the petrified cascade in \"St. Paul's,\" although a craggy partition\r\nseparated us from our route up the ladder. We explored the edges of\r\nthis huge surface of stalagmite, which we could not measure, having no\r\nbetter light to guide us than a few tapers, but which could not be much\r\nless than 100 feet wide. Where the deposits came down through crevices\r\nat the top they had settled in jewelled and diapered masses of the most\r\nfantastic patterns. Our situation was, however, too precarious for\r\nlingering in this strange spot, and without another man to back one up\r\nit was impossible to explore the hole at the top. We gave up our quest\r\nreluctantly and returned towards our ladder, incrusted from head to\r\nfoot with the thick, plastic clay. A convenient knob of stalagmite\r\nenabled us to give the rope a hitch whilst we scrambled down to the top\r\nof our ladder.\r\n\r\nOne other passage from the main cavern was explored, with a curious\r\ncluster of vertical cavities near its extremity. The end of the\r\npassage was coated in every direction with tinted deposits, among\r\nwhich we noticed beautiful specimens of the branching stalactites\r\nthat were called _anemolites_ by the explorers of the Blue John\r\ncaverns, who thought they had acquired their abnormal shapes through\r\nthe irregularity of evaporation caused by air currents. I climbed 30\r\nor 40 feet up one of the openings in the roof, whilst Dr. Sheldon\r\nexplored another. At the top we found no exits big enough to afford\r\na man passage. A wider cavity in the middle of the roof looked more\r\npromising. A ladder was adjusted, but fell short; but my companion,\r\nwith considerable risk of a dangerous fall, clambered up to the rocky\r\nslope and over the piles of jagged blocks that well-nigh filled it.\r\nThis too failed to afford us a passage, and the daring climber had\r\ngreat difficulty in coming down, being forced to thread the rope and\r\nlet himself down on it to the ladder. During the operation a flake of\r\nrock came hurtling down and hit the ladder, but luckily did nothing\r\nworse than smash a rung. These cavities in the roof were extremely\r\ninteresting, and no doubt are connected together and have a common\r\norigin in some neighbouring fissure or waterway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE CAVERNS AT CHEDDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cheddar gorge, which is the deepest and narrowest defile, and\r\non its south side presents the loftiest face of absolutely vertical\r\nrock in England, is not dissimilar, though far superior in height\r\nand grandeur, to the Winnats pass in Derbyshire. The huge chasm runs\r\neast-north-east across the dip of the Limestone beds, which are tilted\r\nup towards the saddle of Mendip; one of its sides, consequently, is\r\nformed mainly of shelving rock, and the other is almost continuously\r\nprecipitous. If, as may be assumed with confidence, the original\r\ncause of the ravine was a stream or streams flowing through a chain\r\nof caverns, one would naturally expect to find openings on the abrupt\r\nside through which the underground waters were successively tapped,\r\nand followed the trend of the strata to a lower level. This view is\r\nconfirmed by observation. Except at the jaws of the defile, where\r\nboth sides are equally high and precipitous, there are no caves on\r\nthe northern side, but on the south openings both large and small\r\nare frequent, some narrow and lofty--\"slitters,\" they are called\r\nlocally--the others low and wide, according as they originated in a\r\nvertical joint or a bedding plane. They occur at various levels, some\r\non inaccessible shelves high up in the cliffs, others along the base.\r\nBut the larger number of these openings have in the lapse of time\r\nbecome silted up with clay and débris, so that the entrance is either\r\ncompletely masked or it is impossible to penetrate far without toilsome\r\nwork with pick and shovel.\r\n\r\nAfter exploring the Great Cavern our party of four devoted some time\r\nto an examination of these openings, so far as could be done without\r\nexcavating. There are three important caverns in close proximity to\r\nthe Great Cavern, or Gough's. The best known is Cox's, a small but\r\nexceedingly beautiful stalactite cavern (see frontispiece). No one\r\ninterested in caves would think of visiting Cheddar without seeing\r\nthe Great Cavern, nor would any such person dream of missing Cox's.\r\nEach is the complement of the other as a piece of underground scenery.\r\nThe spacious vaults and vast stalagmite falls of the one fill one\r\nwith a sense of power and majesty; the other is a gem of fantastic\r\narchitecture, embellished with the most lawless and fairy-like designs\r\nof the subterranean artificer, and unique in one respect--the wealth\r\nand diversity of the mineral deposits that have dyed its multiform\r\nincrustations with luminous tints. No sane man, however, would attempt\r\nto describe Cox's Cavern in detail, and a photograph can give only\r\ncolourless glimpses of its kaleidoscopic beauties. The cavern seems,\r\nat first sight, to be a solitary freak of nature, having no connection\r\nwith the general system of caves and streams. But since the visit just\r\nreferred to, several new passages have been opened, among them the\r\ninteresting water-tunnel with its ebb and flow corresponding to the\r\nmovements of the Cheddar Water outside, which, as already described,\r\nflows at a higher level. Of three other good-sized fissures or ancient\r\nchannels radiating from the same large chamber, two after a while\r\ndwindle away almost to nothing, but the third has indications of a\r\nchannel striking downwards, which it might be worth while to clear of\r\nrubbish. All these passages were choked with clay until quite recently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN COX'S CAVERN AT CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT RIFT CAVERN, CHEDDAR GORGE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nThe next cave also is of minor interest to the speleologist, although\r\nit contains many curious sights. It is called \"Gough's Old Cavern,\"\r\nand its entrance is close to the mouth of the Great Cavern. It is an\r\nascending cleft, apparently not linked at present with the other caves,\r\nalthough it was once probably a sloping aven draining into the big\r\nseries of caverns that have been gradually cut back by the falling in\r\nof the defile. Whoever likes such things may find here plenty of those\r\nfreaks and alleged similitudes that puzzle and delight the ordinary\r\nsightseer. On a stalagmite excrescence nicknamed the \"Ribs of Beef\" we\r\nhad the luck to see a far more interesting phenomenon. The calcite mass\r\nwas clustered over with a number of motionless black objects, which\r\nwe found to be roosting bats, hanging head downwards by their claws.\r\nThey were not disturbed in the least by our presence, and one that\r\nwas lifted off gently just showed his teeth and claws, and clung on\r\nagain as fast as ever when replaced on the rock to resume his patient\r\nsleep. A photograph of this curious sight was obtained by means of the\r\nflashlight. At the head of the cave are several incrusted grottoes,\r\nwhere the process of deposition is still going on, roof and walls\r\nstreaming with moisture. This part is not unlike the show places in the\r\nBagshawe Cavern in the Peak of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the Roman Cave is much more interesting. Its mouth is\r\nsituated about 150 feet up the cliffs, almost immediately over the cave\r\njust described. Quantities of Roman pottery, coins, bones, and other\r\nremains, have been discovered there, showing it to be one of the places\r\nthat sheltered fugitives after the evacuation of Britain by the Roman\r\nlegions. The entrance is a broad anticlinal arch, and the main passage,\r\nhigh-roofed and ascending gradually, runs east for perhaps a furlong.\r\nThen the floor, which has been covered with earth and stones, becomes\r\nrugged and rock-strewn, and suddenly we creep through a lowly portal\r\ninto a high and gloomy chamber, the shadowy corners of whose roof\r\nour lights are too feeble to explore. To all appearances this was the\r\nend of the cavern; but we had been told that the passage takes a turn\r\nhere and goes on nearly a quarter of a mile farther. We scanned every\r\npart of the walls as far up as we could see, but no accessible opening\r\ndisclosed itself. In a recess on one side a number of fallen rocks\r\nwere piled up and wedged between the converging walls. To examine the\r\ncavity from a vantage spot, we climbed with a good deal of difficulty\r\nto the top of these, and there, to our astonishment, a wide passage\r\nsloped up at right angles to the one we had entered by. A curious slit\r\nin the wall opened into a perpendicular fissure that was situated right\r\nin the roof of the latter, and through the hole we caught a glimpse of\r\nour friends following us up. Three men now pushed on up the new passage\r\nand entered a chamber whose sole exit was a small and uninviting hole.\r\nWe crawled and scraped through, and on over sharp stones till at last\r\nwe could get no farther. We had evidently doubled back over the main\r\ncavern, and that we could not be far from the open air was shown by\r\nthe presence of a bewildered bat, who flew to and fro in the confined\r\nspace and hit us in the face several times. And in the extreme recess\r\nof this narrow branch a steady draught of air blew in through a crevice\r\nand nearly put the lights out. Through an oversight we found ourselves\r\nat this point reduced to two tapers and a bit, and to economise we\r\nkept only one alight at a time, so as to have enough for the return\r\njourney. All went well, however, and the sole difficulty we met with\r\nwas in getting down over the wedged blocks in the big chamber, a climb\r\nthat proved extremely awkward when taken the reverse way. In many\r\nparts of this cavern we noticed prodigious quantities of moths on the\r\nwalls, as well as many huge spiders. But a more interesting thing was\r\nthe vegetation naturalised in the caves, examples of which we found\r\nin other Mendip caverns as well. It will be advisable to have them\r\nexamined by a botanical specialist. All I can say about them now is\r\nthat they consist of extremely slender branching tendrils, some white\r\nand translucent, others brownish, thin as cotton.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when we entered the Roman Cavern; it\r\nwas dark now, and the stars were out. Returning in advance of the\r\nothers, I sat down just within the majestic gateway of the cavern, a\r\nflattened arch about 100 feet wide resting on enormous rocky jambs, and\r\nlooked out across the deep wooded abyss where Cheddar lay, its lights\r\nreflected here and there by the dark waters of the mere, towards the\r\ncraggy heights of Mendip opposite, just sinking down towards Sedgemoor.\r\nThe Great Bear was shining brightly right in front--it almost spanned\r\nthe breadth of the cave mouth; and the solemnity of the place and\r\nthe hour could not but bring to mind the miserable fugitives who sat\r\nin this forlorn asylum, hemmed in by foes, and looked out on the\r\nsame giant constellation thrice five hundred years ago. The place is\r\nadmirably adapted for defence. A rear attack was of course impossible,\r\nwhilst a frontal attack by way of the cliffs would be easily repelled;\r\nand a tolerable water-supply was to be found inside the cavern. The\r\nhuge natural glacis of the fortress is covered to-day with a dense\r\ntangle of ivy and other climbers, through which we made our way\r\nheedfully, for a slip would have been easy in the dark, and a terrible\r\nfall the consequence.\r\n\r\nNext morning we strolled up the defile and looked at the mouths of\r\nseveral caves that are now choked up. Two furlongs above its entrance\r\nthe ravine makes a double curve like a gigantic figure three. The\r\ntwo crescents of beetling Limestone, with their jutting horns, that\r\nappear to the astonished beholder underneath like towering pyramids\r\nand slim aiguilles, rise to a vertical height of 430 feet, and,\r\nbeing absolutely unassailable, they fill a crag climber's mind with\r\nadmiration tempered by regret. What enhances their grandeur, while it\r\nsoftens the savage aspect of the sheer and ledgeless precipice, is the\r\nbountiful vegetation clinging wherever it can find a hold, dark shrouds\r\nof ivy and darker masses of yew standing out against the grey rock in\r\nbeautiful relief. Would the indomitable scramblers who haunt Lakeland\r\nat Easter, we asked ourselves, have forced a way up these tremendous\r\n\"chimneys\" if the Cheddar cliffs had been pitched somewhere in the\r\nlatitude of Wastdale? We went so far as to reconnoitre one alluring\r\nfissure, 200 feet or more in length, but the gap between its base and\r\nthe first feasible lodgment was insuperable. Not far away a long talus\r\nof scree marks the foot of an easy though rather sensational way to\r\nthe cliff top. Passing it by, we stopped at the mouth of a vertical\r\nfissure that opens on to the roadway. It expands slightly inside, and\r\nthe roof soars higher and higher; then the floor breaks away, and the\r\ntwo men who descended the next 80 feet had to be steadied by the rope.\r\nThe walls were wet and soft, being incrusted with a sticky calcareous\r\nsubstance. At the bottom of the precipitous slope the magnesium ribbon\r\nrevealed the enormously lofty walls of a narrow chamber, whose farther\r\nextent was blocked up by an accumulation of rocks and débris.\r\n\r\nReturning to the open air, we ascended to the cliff top, and, skirting\r\neach promontory and rounding the edge of every bay, proceeded towards\r\nthe mouth of the defile on the lookout for openings. Not far from the\r\nhighest point we had noticed from the road a series of dark cavities.\r\nOne man scrambled along a ledge to the uppermost of these, and found\r\nthat it was merely a shallow niche, and another, on a ledge some 50\r\nfeet lower, proved to be only 20 feet deep. He made a determined effort\r\nto reach another fissure on the same level as the last but sundered\r\nfrom it by a wide space of cliff which was covered with dense brambles.\r\nHolding on to the prickly stems, and fighting his way through, he got\r\nnear enough to see into the fissure, but was quite unable to enter\r\nit for a closer examination. An opening in the cliffs at a lower\r\npoint, but still some 200 feet above the road, led a long way into the\r\nrecesses of the Limestone strata, making two wide curves to the right,\r\nbut maintaining a generally easterly direction. The passages were very\r\nlow, narrow, and awkwardly shaped, involving a great deal of unpleasant\r\ncrawling; and when we reached the stalagmite grotto at the end we\r\nfound that it had been pillaged of every bit of calcite that could be\r\nremoved. This cavern, the \"Long Hole,\" must have been the channel of a\r\nstream that once flowed from somewhere on the other side of the gorge,\r\nthrough the mass of rock that has now been swept away by the forces of\r\ndisintegration. Though several hundred feet long, it is but the tail\r\nend of the cavern that once existed.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our time was devoted to two of the Burrington caverns,\r\non the opposite side of the Mendip Hills, and to a fruitless search\r\nfor a large chasm or swallet hole into which the drainage from the now\r\nabandoned lead mines on the top of Mendip used to fall and ultimately\r\nfind its way to Cheddar, where it poisoned the trout stream. A score\r\nor more of years ago I saw these mines, still in working order; but\r\nnow the dried-up pools and the wilderness of refuse, with fragments of\r\nruined buildings, look as old almost as the remains of the Roman mines.\r\nOf the important opening that we sought there is now no trace; it may\r\nhave been filled up intentionally and the stream allowed to revert\r\nto its old channel, whence it had been turned artificially. Hard by,\r\nin the Long Wood near Charterhouse, and elsewhere, there are smaller\r\nswallets that we were already acquainted with; and there are others at\r\nPriddy, the waters of which find an exit farther to the east.\r\n\r\nThe ground we were on is well known to readers of Walter Raymond's\r\nromances, and we were much interested when it was pointed out that the\r\nlonely house facing us was the actual Ubley Farm that figures in _Two\r\nMen o' Mendip_.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURRINGTON CAVERNS\r\n\r\n\r\nBurrington Combe is a smaller Limestone defile on the north side of\r\nMendip--that is to say, the opposite side to that of Cheddar. It is\r\nsmaller, and because of its proximity to Cheddar it has to suffer\r\ndisadvantageous comparisons. Anywhere else the grandeur of Burrington\r\nCombe, the magnificence of its crags, with dark, heather-clad Black\r\nDown lowering behind them, and the beauty of the copses that lurk in\r\nits corners and clamber up its precipices, would excite the admiration\r\nof guide-books and attract crowds of tourists. Like the Cheddar defile,\r\nBurrington Combe was doubtless formed by the gradual destruction of a\r\nseries of caverns, and there remains of that series a number of caves\r\nor openings of blocked-up caves on either side of the ravine. Of these\r\nthe most important and the only one well known to speleologists is\r\nGoatchurch Cavern, which was explored by Professor Boyd Dawkins in\r\n1864. The next in importance is Aveline's Hole, discovered in 1796,\r\nbut not explored till 1820, when about fifty human skeletons were\r\nfound lying side by side with their weapons, a stalagmitic crust\r\nsealing bones and implements to the floor. This cavern has since had\r\nits mouth silted up by drainage from the road, so that troublesome\r\nexcavation will have to be undertaken before it can be entered again.\r\nIt would well repay a thorough exploration, for it is reported that\r\na natural pit, covered by a slab, has never yet been descended, and\r\nleads probably into important cavities. Foxe's Hole is interesting for\r\nits curious bosses of tufaceous stalactite. A nearly vertical cave,\r\nPlumley's Den, has been stopped up with a plug of timber and stones\r\nat the depth of 80 feet, in consequence of a fatal accident to a man\r\nwho tried to descend it in 1875. At a level probably a few feet below\r\nthat of the caves whose destruction was the origin of the Combe, a good\r\nroad with a grassy margin now ascends towards the top of Mendip, where\r\nit joins the old Roman road that runs from \"Severn Sea\" to Old Sarum,\r\nalong the crown of the ridge.\r\n\r\nOur waggonette when we left the Bath Arms at Cheddar was piled up with\r\nropes, cameras, gas cylinders, condensers for the searchlight, and an\r\nincredible amount of needful and superfluous things, for we were quite\r\nunable to say what would be wanted. Climbing to the miniature mountain\r\npass across Mendip at Shipham was hard work for the horse, and we\r\nwalked up the hill. Dr. Sheldon and Mr. Bamforth were my companions.\r\nOur clothes, still richly daubed with the clay and mire of the Cheddar\r\ncaverns, made our appearance both business-like and picturesque. The\r\nnorth side of the Mendips is very different from the bleak and craggy\r\nslopes on the south. From the broad bare top of the hills down to the\r\nvalley stretches, almost continuously, a deep mass of trees that looks\r\nin the distance like a wall of dusky verdure. We drove between orchards\r\nwhere great bushes of mistletoe grew on nearly every tree, till we\r\nwere within a few hundred yards of Burrington village; then, turning\r\ntowards Mendip, we drove through more orchards, till suddenly the rocky\r\nentrance of the Combe appeared and we heard the clink of pick and\r\ncrowbar in the Limestone quarry not far from Plumley's Den. Half-way up\r\nthe gorge makes a sudden bend towards the east, a little below which\r\npoint a shallower ravine comes in on the other side. About 120 feet\r\nabove the bed of this dry ravine is the entrance to Goatchurch Cavern.\r\nWe coaxed the horse over the stony turf and up the ravine till the\r\nroughness of the ground and the thickness of the bramble bushes stopped\r\nhim. At this point we were met by the lord of the manor, Mr. James\r\nGibson of Langford, who is the owner of the Burrington caves. His men\r\nassisted us to get our apparatus up to the cave mouth, and afterwards\r\nconvoyed us and the luggage throughout the less difficult parts of the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the entrance to Goatchurch Cavern was an insignificant\r\nhole, through which adventurous boys used to crawl as far as the\r\nfirst considerable chamber, where Professor Boyd Dawkins found a few\r\nremains of extinct animals. Owing to the depredations which were made\r\nby neighbouring villagers in search of specimens of calcite, Mr.\r\nGibson recently had the entrance enlarged and closed with a padlocked\r\ngate, the public being admitted only on certain days of the week or\r\nby appointment. It is a pity this step was not taken before many of\r\nthe finer stalactites had been carried away. In this long chamber,\r\nthe floor of which is covered with sheets and bosses of dripstone, we\r\nentered some of the funnel-shaped openings in the roof by means of a\r\nladder, but soon perceived that no discoveries were to be made that\r\nway. At the end of the chamber a precipitous hole goes down to the\r\nleft, and fixed ropes are used for getting into the lower galleries.\r\nWe found ourselves at once entering on a maze of passages, where\r\nthe presence of our guides saved valuable time. So intricate and\r\nbewildering are these ramifications that Mr. Balch tells me that he\r\ndiscovered a passage some years ago that led him eventually to a much\r\ndeeper part of the cavern than had ever been reached before, but every\r\nattempt to rediscover the passage since has failed. In spite of our\r\nefforts to examine every branch of the various passages, we also missed\r\nthis important link. It would seem that the solid mass of the hill has\r\nbeen shivered here into vast, roughly cubical fragments, between which\r\nlie the irregular passages and narrow chambers of the cavern. Many\r\ntempting galleries lead the explorer on and on till they dwindle to a\r\nmere rabbit hole, or till he finds himself wedged in the cleft between\r\ntwo enormous surfaces of rock. Disorderly accumulations of boulders\r\nand splinters cover the floor; there is hardly a level spot anywhere,\r\nand it is desirable to explore every yard carefully with a taper or a\r\nlantern to avoid the consequences of a rash step. We crawled on hands\r\nand knees and wormed along through insignificant holes, making our way\r\ninto spots that had probably not been inspected before; but we always\r\ncame back to the main channel, where our guides were waiting, having\r\nmade no noteworthy find.\r\n\r\nAssembling again in a more roomy chamber, about 140 feet below the\r\nentrance, we all proceeded along a tunnel that showed evident traces of\r\nthe action of a stream to another chamber, where the sound of running\r\nwater came up from a grim-looking chasm. Only two of us went beyond\r\nthis point. The rest secured the rope, whilst we climbed down the\r\nsteep hole into a large cavern through which the stream runs from the\r\nswallet hole in the ravine outside on its way to Rickford Rising, where\r\nit issues in considerable volume. The stream has a somewhat puzzling\r\ncourse after leaving the cavern, for it runs underground athwart\r\nBurrington Combe and through the solid hill opposite, Burrington Ham.\r\nThis stream, as Professor Boyd Dawkins pointed out, was doubtless the\r\noriginating cause of Goatchurch Cavern, running in at the present\r\nmouth, which is now dry. The ravine outside has since been hollowed\r\nout to a further depth of 120 feet, and the stream finds its way in at\r\na lower level. The Professor also describes a very pretty experiment.\r\nHaving taken the temperature of the stream before it enters the cave,\r\nhe tested it again after it had run some distance underground, finding\r\nthat it was here several degrees cooler. It is obvious that a colder\r\nstream must have joined it at some unknown point midway.\r\n\r\nThe nethermost series of chambers and passages are not very different\r\nfrom those above, their shape rugged and irregular, and their floor\r\nheaped up with fragments of all sizes. We reached no lower point than\r\nthat attained by previous explorers--that is, 220 feet below the\r\nentrance, as measured by aneroid. Squeezing with difficulty through\r\nthe deepest fissure, I found myself in a small cave, whence, turning\r\nround, I only perceived one exit. It looked and felt so small that I\r\ndespaired of pushing through and turned to go back, when it suddenly\r\noccurred to me that this was the hole I had come in by, and there was\r\nno other way out. Such little incidents often happen in cave work,\r\nbut most often in such a complicated network of tunnels and fissures\r\nas the Goatchurch Cavern, where we were quite convinced that an\r\nimportant passage ran due east until the compass assured us that the\r\ndirection was west. Clambering up a steep bank of stiff clay out of the\r\nlowest cave, we reached a vaulted grotto with a cascade of stalagmite\r\nflowing down one side. On the edge of this a sloping passage disclosed\r\nitself, lined with stalagmite, and we ascended it in the expectation\r\nof finding something new. It brought us by an easy scramble back to\r\nthe upper cave, whence we had descended on the rope; and with little\r\nmore deviation from the main passages we made our way back to the cave\r\nmouth, where a well-earned lunch was waiting.\r\n\r\nBut little time was wasted in examining the silted-up entrance to\r\nAveline's Hole and another cave mouth, and the next halt was made at\r\nPlumley's Den. Tying two Alpine ropes together, a pair of us descended\r\nthis ancient pothole as far as the artificial pile of débris that\r\nblocks it up. One man was hit rather severely by a dislodged stone--a\r\nserious danger in caves of this sort--and in returning he dropped and\r\nsmashed his acetylene lamp. The hole is effectually plugged, a tree and\r\na quantity of stone having been flung in after Plumley's fatal mishap;\r\nand until Mr. Gibson carries out his proposal to remove the stones that\r\nblock it, the 200 feet which are said, on doubtful authority, to lie\r\nbeyond can never be explored. Mr. Gibson also proposes to bore a new\r\nentrance from the Combe into the lower series of caves at Goatchurch.\r\nAbove Plumley's Den a magnificent rib of Limestone, like those at\r\nMatlock, springs nearly to the hilltop; and over the way a picturesque\r\npile of crag comes out to meet it, and is known as the \"Rock of Ages,\"\r\nfrom the tradition that Toplady, the divine, taking shelter under it\r\nfrom a storm, composed his famous hymn there.\r\n\r\nStill piloted by our kind host, we walked across Burrington Ham and saw\r\nthe brook which we had heard babbling amid the silence of Goatchurch\r\nCavern flowing out, a strong body of water, at Rickford Rising, after\r\na subterranean course of about two miles from its sources high up on\r\nBlack Down.\r\n\r\nRickford Rising is in the Secondary beds, but a short mile up the\r\nbeautiful Combe at whose outlet it lies, a Limestone ridge comes down\r\nto the road. Hard by the extremity is a hole in the rocky ground, now\r\nalmost entirely choked with stones, but not so many years ago an open\r\npit. It is known as the \"Squire's Well.\" Here, in times of continuous\r\nrain, a body of water issues forth, often flooding the road. It seems\r\nto be connected with the water-channels that feed Rickford Rising, to\r\nwhich it acts as a safety valve. To open it would not be a very serious\r\naffair, and might discover something interesting.\r\n\r\nAt the back of Mendip Lodge, on the hill immediately west of Burrington\r\nCombe, the hilltop is cut up by innumerable ravines ending in\r\nswallets, the water of which comes to light again in a large stream\r\nin the Yeo valley near Upper Langford, about a mile away. Several of\r\nthese swallets look as if they would repay the trouble of a little\r\nexcavation; and the size of the stream at the point of issue indicates\r\nthe existence of large cavities in the line of its subterranean course.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORAL CAVE AT COMPTON BISHOP\r\n\r\n\r\nA cave just discovered near Compton Bishop, on the skirts of Mendip,\r\nfurnishes valuable evidence in corroboration of the theory that the\r\nLimestone caverns of this region were formed at a period enormously\r\nanterior to that generally accepted. It is situated a little way up the\r\nslope of Wavering Down, only a short distance above the upper limit\r\nof the red marl laid down in the Triassic age, unconformably on the\r\ndenuded edges of the Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n\r\nWe had been engaged in some exploring work in the Cheddar caves, the\r\nresults of which were of a negative kind, but none the less important,\r\nas modifying the lines of costly excavation. Accompanied by the Messrs.\r\nGough, the proprietors of the great cave at Cheddar, we proceeded late\r\nin the day to Axbridge, where Mr. Balch joined the party. Our goal was\r\na certain cavern, explored about a century ago, and described by the\r\nantiquary Phelps, but now little known. This purpose was, however,\r\nnot carried out that day, for in making inquiries about the cave as\r\nwe passed through the village of Cross, we got wind of a cavern that\r\nhad never yet been explored, and was therefore treasure-trove to such\r\nardent cave workers. Two years ago, in blasting for stone to line a\r\ndrinking-place for cattle, a farmer had blown a hole into the top of\r\na subterranean cavity. Two 30-rung ladders were lashed together, so\r\nwe learned, and a bold countryman, secured by a cart-rope, descended\r\ninto the mysterious hollow, alighting on a slope of shifting stones\r\nand earth, whence he could see a second chasm, black as Tophet and of\r\nunknown profundity, yawning beneath him. No one would venture on this\r\nfurther descent; a rock was rolled against the opening to prevent sheep\r\nor incautious persons from tumbling in, and there for the time being\r\nwas an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nOur first task was to withdraw this formidable plug. It was a sound,\r\nunfissured block of Mountain Limestone, weighing perhaps half a ton. We\r\nthought that six men with a rope ought to move it easily; but we could\r\nnot make it budge. A spade and a crowbar were fetched, with which we\r\nlaboured diligently for an hour; but the only effect was to drop the\r\nstone deeper into the hole. A sledgehammer was now obtained from the\r\nnearest smithy, and one after another we attacked the foe with might\r\nand main. At length it yielded. Pieces flaked off, and at last it\r\nsplit; the fragments tumbled into the chasm, and the rock, diminished\r\nto half its former size, was rolled away. The job had taken two hours\r\nand a half, and it was now dark.\r\n\r\nMr. Balch and I cast lots for the honour of the first descent: it fell\r\nto me. An Alpine Club rope was tied on as life-line, whilst a 70-foot\r\ncotton rope was to be used for lowering and lifting. Slung in a bight\r\nof the latter, I was carefully let down over the cliff-like face below\r\nthe entrance. The cavity formed part of a huge choked swallet, which\r\nextended up into the hill above the point where we had been working,\r\nand ran away obliquely underneath, so that I was coming down from a\r\nhole perforating one corner of the roof. Over against the hole was\r\nthe steep slope of earth and scree already mentioned, steep almost\r\nas a wall, and the scree so loose that it seemed to be in a state\r\nof suspended animation. As soon as one came into contact with the\r\ntreacherous stuff, an avalanche of stones was launched, and I sought\r\nin vain for a spot where it would be safe to unrope and await the next\r\nman. The cliff down which I had been lowered was undercut by a wide\r\narchway, through which I looked into a black, forbidding pit gaping at\r\nthe bottom. With nowhere to rest, and with the risk of falling stones,\r\nit was obviously wiser to finish the descent before another man started.\r\n\r\nTying the loose rope round me (for it was necessary to swing out under\r\nthe arch), I was let down slowly, and began to slip over a smooth,\r\ngreasy rock-face into the unknown cavity. At 60 feet from the ground\r\nI alighted at the top of a slope of stones, and was able to remove\r\nthe ropes and scramble to the bottom. Lighting some magnesium wire,\r\nI found myself in a bell-shaped chamber about 65 feet high, opening\r\nabove by the precipitous archway into the upper cavity, and on the\r\nother side into an ascending vault running north-west. All around\r\nwere the indelible marks of water action in the remote past. On the\r\nupper side the rocks were carved and pitted as by the swirling of a\r\nviolent torrent. But there was now no sign of running water, only the\r\ndrip, drip from the moist roof; and the outlet of the ancient stream\r\nat the bottom of the cavern was blocked up by a deep accumulation of\r\ndébris. Among the countless fragments strewn all over the floor I found\r\na large stone covered with a mass of dog-tooth crystals, clear as\r\ndiamonds and large as walnuts. But at the very bottom of the place was\r\nsomething even more lovely, myriads upon myriads of exquisite spicules\r\nof carbonate, some little more than specks of red, orange, and amber,\r\nbut thousands like wee tendrils of coral three-eighths of an inch\r\nin length. They were the growth, through age after age, of a splash\r\ndeposit from the roof or from the stream that had disappeared. Such a\r\nformation is not rare in water caverns; but in such beauty of shape and\r\nhue it is rare indeed, for these tender little crystal flowers took\r\nall manner of forms, blossoming ofttimes into wreaths and clusters\r\nlike a miniature coral. One of the most exquisite and most puzzling\r\nfeatures was that the dots and spicules were often arranged in set\r\npatterns, symmetrical and even geometrical, in tiny circles, squares,\r\nand triangles, by the rhythmic action of the waters that had left this\r\nbeautiful record of their passage. We named the cave the Coral Cavern.\r\n\r\nAs the descent had not been direct, and there might be difficulty in\r\nrecovering the ropes if once let go, it seemed most prudent that no\r\none should follow me down for the present. Climbing the slopes of\r\nrocks and scree that led up through a lofty vault to the north-west,\r\nI reached a height of considerably more than 100 feet above the floor\r\nof the Coral Cavern, the present floor of which is 90 feet below the\r\npoint of entrance. The open way then came to an end abruptly, in a tiny\r\ngrotto, at a distance of 240 feet from that point. But hard by there\r\nwere funnel-like cavities penetrating the roof, and hinting at the\r\nproximity of a Secondary swallet hole on the hillside close overhead.\r\nEvidently, when the cave was in working order, in times of indefinable\r\nremoteness, a big stream had run down this steep vaulted passage, and\r\nunited with the main stream at the bottom, both then pursuing their way\r\ninto the fissures of the rock, and ultimately finding an exit into the\r\nopen air at some point now buried under Triassic deposits. Enormous\r\nslabs of Limestone, smooth, and fitting close over each other like\r\nboiler-plates, formed the sloping floor of this tunnel on one side.\r\nThese too were a conspicuous testimony to powerful water action.\r\n\r\nAt present the red marl of the Trias comes nearly up to the artificial\r\nentrance of the cavity. It is obvious that when the cave was occupied\r\nby a stream, its waters must have found a vent some distance below the\r\nupper limit of the marl; whence it necessarily follows that the marl\r\nhas been laid down here since that period. Much evidence has been\r\ngathered in the course of our cave work in the Mendips to show that\r\nmany of the caverns are older than the vast accumulations of Dolomitic\r\nConglomerate and other deposits of Triassic age, but nowhere is the\r\nproof put so clearly and concisely as by the new cave at Compton Bishop.\r\n\r\nMy stay underground was cut short by the fear that the others would\r\ngrow impatient. I was hauled up without mishap, save that at one point\r\nthe cotton rope stuck fast in a cleft, and I had to pull myself up hand\r\nover hand on the life-line. Two men then went down, with the result we\r\nhad dreaded--the rope could not be got back to the last man without\r\nextreme difficulty. Only after tying on stone after stone, and making\r\nmany a cast in vain, did we ultimately restore communication. He came\r\nup; the guardian block was pushed back into its place; and at a late\r\nhour we struck down the hillside home.\r\n\r\nA day or two later we set out once more to find Phelps's Cavern. It\r\nopens on the very crest of the ridge leading up to Crook Hill, or, as\r\nit is more commonly known to-day, Crook's Peak, a sharp Limestone spur,\r\nrunning south-east from the western extremity of Wavering Down. At the\r\nfoot of the hill, near the road, we came across a small cave, called\r\nthe Fox's Hole, which we searched thoroughly for any continuation\r\nupwards or downwards, but in vain. After a great deal of jamming and\r\nsqueezing, we got in to a distance of 50 feet, where a low chamber\r\nhas holes between wall and floor that had acted as a water-sink to\r\nsome ancient system of cavities. But the floor was heaped with stones,\r\nand in spite of our efforts to clear these out, we did not discover a\r\nsingle hole big enough to enter. This small cave is, doubtless, but the\r\ntail end of the cavern that once existed here; and, indeed, the large\r\ncavern at the hilltop must be little more than a fragment of what it\r\nwas. Crook's Peak seems to be the mere skeleton of a hill. To account\r\nfor the presence of such a cavern at the summit, one must postulate\r\na large drainage area in days gone by, and a general configuration\r\nentirely opposite to the present. The higher part of the hill is but a\r\nLimestone shell enclosing these ancient, and now waterless, caverns.\r\n\r\nThe big cavern is known as Denny's Hole. Descending the sloping side\r\nof an open pit, we found ourselves under an arch of mighty span, the\r\ncrown of which was formed by the rock-wall on the other side. Under\r\nthis arch the floor sloped precipitously into the jaws of the cavern;\r\nthen the roof came close down, and the farther passages wound onwards\r\nas low tunnels, descending steeply into the entrails of the hill. It\r\nis easy enough to get to a considerable depth and distance in the\r\nlargest of these, but the journey is not specially interesting, for the\r\nplace has been looted by adventurous rustics, and serious exploration\r\nis at present brought to a standstill by the enormous quantities of\r\nloose stones filling every cavity in the floor. Coming back to the\r\ncave mouth, we were struck by the grandeur of the vestibule, which has\r\nevery appearance of being the remains of a great subterranean chamber,\r\nthe pit-like entrance, through which we look up to the sky and the\r\nsunshine, being the remnant of a cave-tunnel, once perhaps of very\r\nconsiderable length.\r\n\r\nPhelps had alluded to another chamber, of some beauty, to be attained,\r\nat the expense of divers wrenches and abrasions, by a certain tortuous\r\npassage leading out of the vestibule. After diligent search we found a\r\nhole in the floor at one corner, but it seemed to be only a foot or two\r\ndeep. Kicking about for some time, with body half in and half out of\r\nthe hole, I managed to shift some loose stones, and felt space below.\r\nBut the space proved, on experiment, at least as excellent a place of\r\ntorment as Phelps's description had been able to do justice to. The\r\npassage doubled back upon itself at once, and twisted here and there\r\nlike a corkscrew. Only by obstinate wriggling were we able to worm a\r\nway down to the low cavity at the bottom. Two blind passages started\r\ntherefrom, and in one wall was a long, horizontal slit, with some big\r\nplace beyond, as we judged from the sound of the stones we threw in.\r\nIn various cautious attitudes we inserted ourselves into the slit. The\r\ndrop inside, though fearful to anticipate, was a matter of only a few\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe cave we found ourselves in was a sort of double chamber, with\r\nvestiges of a partition across the middle; the whole was some 40 feet\r\nin length. At one end was a pool of water, stagnant at present, or\r\nnearly so. Close by, a low fissure sloped downwards to a vertical hole\r\nor pot that sounded deep; but we could not get near it for the spikes\r\nof stalactite that guarded it on all sides. This chamber, which we\r\nthought must communicate with the series reached by the main passage\r\nfrom the vestibule, seems to have been hardly ever visited. We heard\r\na story of a lady's pet dog that had been lost here for a week, and\r\nwas not found, although a tempting reward was offered, until a farmer,\r\nwho told us the story, explored the corkscrew tunnel leading to this\r\ncave. He found the poor beast shivering on the edge of the slit we\r\nhad come in by, afraid to jump. Even the farmer, who thought he knew\r\nall the ramifications of this perplexing cavern, did not seem to have\r\nreached this chamber, the natural ornaments of which showed no trace of\r\nspecimen-hunting.\r\n\r\nReturning to daylight, we examined a cave vent in the ground hard by,\r\nwhere a vapour was steaming up into the chilly air. The penetrable\r\nportion was just big enough to accommodate the six feet two of our\r\ntallest man. With some time left on our hands, we decided now to walk\r\non to Loxton, the next village, where another cave was situated on\r\na Limestone hilltop. There were only two miles to walk, so we did\r\nnot think it worth while to doff our cave panoply. Great was the\r\nspeculation that our unexampled appearance excited in the people we\r\nmet. We could not be tramps--in fact, we hardly looked respectable\r\nenough; and yet our rucksacks, ropes, and cameras gave us an air of\r\ndistinction that was puzzling in the extreme. Faces crowded to the\r\nwindows at every house we passed, and at Loxton we had to run the\r\ngauntlet of satiric observation. As we asked our way to the quarry at\r\nLoxton, the general conclusion was that we were in quest of a job there.\r\n\r\nThis cave must have been a very interesting one long ago, but now it\r\nis like those at Compton Bishop, only a remnant; and besides what has\r\nbeen destroyed by natural denudation, a great deal has been damaged by\r\nthe gradual approaches of a Limestone quarry on the side of the hill.\r\nThis has exposed the outlets of several passages. A labyrinth of low\r\ngalleries remains, with a few larger hollows here and there; but of\r\nwhatever beauty they once possessed they have long been denuded by\r\nthe devastating village boy, who has found the intricacies of Loxton\r\nCavern a perfect paradise. It does not follow that the cave would\r\nnecessarily not pay for a thorough exploration. If some of the lower\r\nreaches were carefully examined, entrances would very likely be found\r\ninto still nether caverns, of which these dry channels were at one time\r\nthe feeders. But the work would be peculiarly difficult on account of\r\nthe smallness of the open spaces, and the result uncertain. Yet the\r\nLimestone of the Mendips is so thick--the thickest in England--and the\r\nparts that have been explored are so honeycombed with cavities and\r\npassages, that every gateway into this strange underworld promises\r\nmore or less reward. It is somewhere in the neighbourhood of Loxton\r\nand Banwell that the famous \"Gulf\" was discovered in the days of the\r\nold lead miners. In driving an extensive level through a hill, at a\r\npoint 80 fathoms below the summit, they came upon a gigantic rift. A\r\nman was let down on a long rope--so tradition reports--and when he had\r\ndescended to the full extent of it he was unable to see either walls\r\nor bottom of the tremendous abyss. We are probably on the track of\r\nthis monster cavity, an exploration of which will entail labour and\r\nfortitude. That and the exploration of the swallet at Hillgrove, when\r\nit is opened, are the two most fascinating problems awaiting us in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB'S LAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago the Great Western opened what they called the Wrington\r\nVale Light Railway up the valley of the Yeo, which borders Mendip\r\non the north. A few miles beyond its present terminus lie the two\r\nHarptrees, in the heart of a sequestered countryside of great pastoral\r\nbeauty. Here, where nowadays all the pursuits are agricultural, a great\r\ndeal of mining was carried on in years gone by, the relics of which are\r\nstill visible in the surface workings, grown over with grass. In the\r\nupland ravines of Lamb's Bottom, near the top of the Mendip plateau,\r\nthese are very numerous, and seem to be the work of both lead miners\r\nand searchers for black oxide of manganese. Early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury a cavern of prodigious size and beauty was discovered in this\r\nlocality; but, by one of those curious accidents which are by no\r\nmeans infrequent in the history of caves, it was lost, and its site\r\nremained unknown for a hundred and twenty years. Its fame, however,\r\nwas cherished by the country folk, and the tradition of its fabulous\r\nwonders induced a lord of the manor, a quarter of a century ago, to\r\noffer a heavy monetary reward, which led to its rediscovery in the\r\nyear 1880. This new exploration made some noise at the time, and a\r\nfair number of people ventured on a descent. The difficulties were\r\nsmoothed down considerably. Ladders were fixed in the shaft, which was\r\nstrengthened by timber supports, and in difficult parts of the lower\r\ngalleries; solid beds of arragonite were cut through, and a heavy\r\nstructure of timber, carrying a windlass, was built out on the verge\r\nof an abyss, to make accessible the floor of the Great Chamber. Lamb's\r\nLair is even alluded to, though incorrectly, in the fourth edition of\r\nMurray's Guide--that for 1882--and, for a while, great was the renown\r\nof its unparalleled beauties. Then, as usually happens with cave\r\nscenery when there is any difficulty or any peril involved, the novelty\r\nand the popularity of Lamb's Lair waned; and now for a long period the\r\ncave has been derelict, the timber erections have become rotten and\r\ndangerous, and the only visit during many years previous to the one I\r\nam about to describe nearly resulted in a catastrophe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO LAMB'S LAIR, HARPTREE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN AND SECTION OF THE GREAT CAVERN OF LAMB'S LAIR.]\r\n\r\nOur party of four had been engaged in some arduous work near Wells, and\r\na descent into Lamb's Lair meant a long drive across Mendip, nearly to\r\nEast Harptree. We were dropped by our waggonette, with a great pile of\r\napparatus, at a gate into a field. The field was part of the Lamb's\r\nBottom ravine, and we had some difficulty in locating the entrance to\r\nour cavern among the innumerable workings and natural depressions that\r\ncut up the surface. At length we caught sight of the end of a ladder\r\nsticking out from a hole that was buried in brushwood, and straightway\r\nwe found ourselves on the brink of the 60-foot shaft. The uppermost\r\nladder was broken six feet from the top, and so was the second; neither\r\nwas fit to be trusted. We supported the broken part of the top ladder\r\nwith a forked branch, and I took up my station on a ledge 15 feet\r\ndown, to steady the things as they were lowered. Each man was roped\r\nfor the descent, for the crazy ladders, the decayed woodwork, and the\r\nloose stones in the shaft all threatened disaster. At last all our\r\nparaphernalia was safe at the bottom, and now a muddy progress began\r\nthrough a narrow, dripping cleft into a low tunnel, that brought us,\r\nafter many windings, to the top of a fourth ladder. This one was not\r\nso high, but it was quite as shaky as the others, and a member of the\r\nparty got a nasty blow on the shoulder from a beam connected with it,\r\nthat gave way whilst we were passing the luggage from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nDescending still through an irregular passage, we suddenly entered a\r\nroomy vault with stalactites on the roof. Here the glories of Lamb's\r\nLair begin. In a few moments we shall be at the threshold of the\r\nincomparable Beehive Chamber, and thence, to a point far beyond what\r\nwe can attain to-day, the poetry and witchery of cave scenery are\r\nat their finest. Stumbling over the irregularities of the crystal\r\nfloor, we see dimly, by the light of our candles, great luminous arcs\r\nbending over our heads; and then, catching sight of a regularly shaped\r\nhemisphere rising out of the darkness and dwarfing the cave with its\r\nenormous proportions, we realise that this is the Beehive Chamber. When\r\nthe limelight is brought in, and its fierce beams play upon the wild\r\narcades and groining of this fantastic vault, we are astounded by the\r\nwealth and brilliance and extraordinary variety of the incrustations:\r\nnot a rib, not a corner of bare rock remains visible; every inch of\r\nfloor and walls and roof has been thickly coated with the calcareous\r\nenamel. The Beehive itself, 12 feet high and enormous in girth, is not\r\nmore astonishing for its size than for the regularity of its shape. It\r\nis probably the largest boss of stalagmite in England. The sides are\r\nstreaked with white and yellow bands, which enhance the weird symmetry\r\nand polish of its appearance; and, on the summit, wide enough for a man\r\nto walk about, we noticed that a number of stalactites, fallen from the\r\nvault above, had become embedded in its mass, and were slowly being\r\ncrusted over with the ceaseless deposits. All over the chamber there\r\nis a continuous patter of water-drops, carrying on the work of the\r\nages, and laying film after film of lustre on the imageries of this\r\nhidden shrine, which man has visited so rarely. To right and left of\r\nthe Beehive the uneven floor descends into deep recesses--which we see\r\nas we draw nigh to be rocky porches adorned with the most magnificent\r\nincrustations--leading into two passages. These two porches, the arch\r\nby which we have entered, and the wild vaulting that rises to an apex\r\nover our heads amid a profusion of glistening stalactites, are the\r\ndominant features of this piece of fairy architecture. But who can\r\ncount or describe the gleaming volutes and scrolls that wind over the\r\nwalls in brilliant confusion, the clustered corbels whence random ribs\r\nspring towards the roof, the lace-like fringe of delicate stalactites\r\nthat hangs from every ridge, or the gnome-like fingers and ghoulish\r\nfaces, staring and pointing downwards, that one seems to discern amid\r\nthe disordered sculpture of roof and walls?\r\n\r\nA broken bottle of paraffin and some pieces of cotton-waste, evidently\r\nthe relics of the last party who had used them to light up the Beehive\r\nChamber years ago, were lying in a corner just as they were left. In\r\none of the galleries I noticed the marks of fingers and the impress of\r\nthe clothes of a man who had crawled along the clay floor--as fresh as\r\nif he had been there an hour ago. This changelessness of everything\r\nfills one with a certain awe; but what impresses one as still more\r\nwonderful is that all this consummate beauty and grandeur should lie\r\nconcealed and unknown in the midst of modern England, only a few miles\r\naway from important cities, but unvisited by a soul for long periods\r\nof years, while the country people seem hardly aware of the cave's\r\nexistence. Were the cave easily accessible, one can hardly question\r\nthat crowds of sightseers would be attracted, and much of the charm\r\nwould be dispelled, even if its treasures were not ransacked. For the\r\npresent these are perfectly safe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"BEEHIVE\" CHAMBER, LAMB'S LAIR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE WALL, LAMB'S LAIR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\nFrom the Beehive Chamber a passage winds downward under one of the\r\nglorious porches already described, and on and on between walls of\r\ncalcspar and arragonite, toward the chief wonder of Lamb's Lair, the\r\nGreat Chamber. The original passage was low and difficult, and early\r\nexplorers cut a deeper way through solid beds of arragonite, whose\r\nmiraculous whiteness glistens on every side as we advance. So enormous\r\nis the thickness of this compact and fine-grained variety of the\r\ncalcium carbonate, with its delicate lines of crystallisation showing\r\ntransparently where it is shattered, that fully three and a half feet\r\nare shown in section, a wall of snowy brilliance; and one cannot judge\r\nhow much more is hidden. The tunnel widens into an arch of reddish\r\nrock, covered with sparry reliefs; then suddenly we find ourselves\r\nstepping on a plank, and out of the darkness ahead starts up the gaunt\r\nshape of a windlass. We have reached the spot where the gallery breaks\r\ninto the upper part of the Great Chamber; under our feet is a black\r\nvoid, and further progress is forbidden. The gallery ends on a sloping\r\nbevel, 10 feet wide, that dips steeply into the chasm. On this bevel,\r\nwhich overhangs by many feet the receding wall of the Great Chamber, a\r\ntimber platform was erected a quarter of a century ago. It is a sort of\r\ncantilever, with the windlass resting on the long arms. We moved here\r\nwith utmost caution, hardly venturing to place a foot on the time-worn\r\nstructure without holding on to the rocks at the side. On the last\r\noccasion that the cavern was visited, some years ago, a fatal accident\r\nwas averted almost by a miracle. The rope broke while Mr. Balch was\r\ndescending; he fell about 60 feet, on to the broken rocks beneath,\r\nchecking his fall by catching at a tangle of line that was hanging\r\nnear. His hands were cut to the bone, and he lay at the bottom stunned\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, and has hardly ceased to feel the effects\r\nof the shaking. Naturally, he now felt little inclination to venture\r\nanother descent, especially as he told us that the rickety state of the\r\nplatform has filled him with grave doubts as to its safety if weight\r\nwere put on it.\r\n\r\nAt present, beyond the stark shape of the windlass, darkness reigned.\r\nWe flung blocks of arragonite out into the void. There was an interval\r\nof silence, then a crash on the hard floor, and the missile burst\r\ninto fragments. When the ray of our 2000-candle-power searchlight\r\nflashed across the abyss, we found ourselves looking into a chamber\r\nwhose weird majesty held us spellbound. Its height is 110 feet, and\r\nthe walls curve gradually over in an irregular dome. Hardly a square\r\nfoot of this mighty wall-space is blank. Stripes and reticulations\r\nand pendulous lacework run all over it in enchanting disorder. Here a\r\nsnow-white flood of calcite drops from an unseen cleft, there a cascade\r\nof many colours ripples down from roof to floor. There are great sheets\r\nof opaline enamel, curtains drooping in massy folds, silken fabrics\r\nwrinkled over the face of the rock, all giving one the sense of motion\r\nsuddenly arrested, and of light and colour captured from the rainbow\r\nand sleeping here in the darkness, waiting year after year for our lamp\r\nto awaken it to life and beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO GREAT CHAMBER, LAMB'S LAIR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGEST CHAMBER IN SOMERSET, LAMB'S LAIR, HARPTREE.\r\n\r\n_From Sketch by H. E. Balch._]\r\n\r\nThe cylinder of oxygen and the ether saturator were pushed out as far\r\nas we dared, and the camera was set up on the edge of the platform,\r\nto secure at least a glimpse of this hall of wonders. We were told\r\nwhat lay beyond. Another gallery, begemmed as richly as the one behind\r\nus, leads on and on, until a high chamber is reached, into which\r\nwater pours over a sheet of snowy stalagmite, 60 feet high. We could\r\nnot descend into the Great Chamber, but we intended to light it up.\r\nA tinful of Bengal fire was put into an iron saucer, hanging from\r\na string by iron wires; and this with a light attached was lowered\r\nthrough the hole in the platform, whereon we lay extended at full\r\nlength looking over into the gulf. There was a fizz, and then the\r\nfierce radiance swept from side to side of the huge vault, staining the\r\nsheets and curtains and cascades of white a splendid crimson. The walls\r\nsparkled blood-red as if set with rubies, and the blue-black sheets of\r\ncalcite marked by oxide of manganese were empurpled by the glow. We\r\nfled before the pungent clouds of smoke that rose into our gallery,\r\nback to the Beehive Chamber, leaving that glorious hall once more to\r\nsolitude and silence.\r\n\r\nThe only other part we explored was the winding tunnel that begins\r\nunder the second porch in the Beehive Chamber. It goes far away down,\r\nand is knee-deep in mire for a considerable distance. At last, when it\r\nseems as if the Great Chamber itself cannot be far away, the passage\r\nends in a choke. We had been in the cavern about five hours, when,\r\nafter much hard work, we got our apparatus back to the foot of the\r\nshaft. Climbing ahead up the rickety ladders, the broken rungs of which\r\nwere caked with mud and clay, and keeping hold of the life-line all\r\nthe while, I found our driver waiting for us at the top, for we were\r\nan hour late. Several dangerous stones were shifted in pulling up the\r\nluggage, and one man below not only received a nasty blow, but narrowly\r\nescaped destruction by another stone that he just succeeded in warding\r\noff his face.\r\n\r\nWe have since regretted that we did not test the platform and windlass\r\nby a rough-and-ready method, and then descend by a long Alpine rope.\r\nThe sharp ledges underneath might, however, have rendered this\r\ndangerous. We had not seen everything, but we had seen enough to\r\nrecompense us abundantly for the toil, the slight risk, and the dirt.\r\nMurray says that Lamb's Lair is the finest cave in Somerset; I would\r\nconfidently venture further, and say that for transcendent beauty it\r\nhas not its equal in England.[4]\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] Mr. James McMurtrie, then manager of Earl Waldegrave's estates,\r\n was responsible for the exploration of this cavern after its\r\n rediscovery in 1880. He had it surveyed and plans made; he had the\r\n windlass erected, but went down himself before it was fixed. Very\r\n great credit is due to him for this valuable work, which it is hoped\r\n will not be rendered less valuable by allowing the artificial shaft\r\n as well as the windlass to be permanently destroyed through neglect\r\n and decay. The plan and section contained here were the result of\r\n independent measurements, which fully confirmed the results of his\r\n previous survey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITES IN ENTRANCE GALLERY, LAMB'S LAIR.\r\n\r\n_Photo by Bamforth, Holmfirth._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAVE IN THE QUANTOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Bridgewater, where we had arrived one winter morning at sunrise,\r\nafter a melancholious journey in unwarmed carriages across the flooded\r\nmoors beyond Glastonbury, not a person had heard tell of a cave in the\r\nQuantocks. But the information we relied on, though a century old, was\r\ndefinite enough to warrant the hire of a trap to convey us and our\r\napparatus to a certain lonely cross-road, seven miles away, in a corner\r\nof the broad parish of Bloomfield. Climbing steadily through Enmore,\r\nwe found the cross-road on a hilltop 800 feet above the sea, hard by\r\na homely tavern, where we got cider for ourselves and feed for the\r\nhorse. To our west was the Beacon on Cotherstone Hill, and two miles\r\nfarther the Fire Signal Pits on Will's Neck (1261 feet), the highest\r\nof the Quantock Hills. But of the red-deer country that lay around us\r\nwe saw little, and less as the day wore on, for a cold sea-mist came\r\nrolling up from the Bristol Channel, and would have given us trouble\r\nin finding our cave, had not a guide appeared providentially. It was a\r\ntattered and weather-beaten countryman, who emerged from the tap-room\r\nand announced that he was the only person who knew anything about\r\nthe cave. He dilated in glowing terms on its beauties--\"It be very\r\nornamental, sur, very ornamental.\" Fox by name and fox by nature, so he\r\ndescribed himself--for he was both garrulous and egotistical--he was\r\nfond of burrowing into holes. That he was a poacher to boot, we had no\r\nreason to disbelieve after a few minutes' conversation. He led us by\r\na veritable fox's path over fields and hedges, through a mist-drenched\r\nspinney, down to a dingle, where beetle-browed rocks overhung the\r\nentrance to the cave. A rusty iron gate barred the way, and was\r\npadlocked. Reynard proposed to make a journey of several miles, at our\r\nexpense, to procure the key; but a broken link in the chain saved us\r\ntime and cider.\r\n\r\nThere is not much Limestone on the Quantocks, and caves are a rarity.\r\nAt this spot an outlier of Carboniferous Limestone lies in close\r\ncontact with beds of Greywacke Slate--a very unusual conjunction,\r\nwhich prepared us for something new and strange in the way of\r\ncrystallisations. Descending a few yards beyond the entrance, the main\r\npassage rises a little, and then drops gradually towards a stagnant\r\npool, beyond which it is impossible to get. The length of this portion\r\nis only 140 feet, and the direction from north-east to south-west.\r\nCertain narrow passages, however, bore into the Limestone on the north,\r\nand extend their ramifications much farther. Only one of these seems\r\nto have been known before our visit. In the main passage, near the\r\npool, is seen the special wonder of Holwell Cave, a brilliant display\r\nof arragonite crystals all over the roof. Arragonite usually occurs\r\nin massive deposits of satin spar, distinguished by a perfection of\r\nwhiteness when newly split, a whiteness that grows dingy very soon if\r\nyou try to keep specimens. Here it occurs in quite another form--the\r\ncoralloid, known as flos ferri; thousands of filaments or spicules\r\nramifying from centres, and looking as soft as cobweb, though as\r\nbrittle as blown glass. This delicate product is often tinged with a\r\npink stain like that of fluor-spar. Andrew Crosse, the electrician,\r\nwho was carrying on his researches in the neighbourhood when Holwell\r\nCavern was found about 1800, thought that the crystal might have been\r\ndistorted by slow degrees into these fanciful shapes \"through the\r\ninvisible action of electric energy,\" an agent to which most mysterious\r\nnatural processes have been attributed some time or another; but the\r\nfibrous arragonite, scientists tell us, is by no means abnormal. It all\r\nlies on the Greywacke part of the roof; the adjoining Limestone has\r\nno arragonite, but is incrusted with the usual sheets and bosses of\r\ncalcite, mutilated somewhat by visitors who have taken away mementos.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't it ornamental, sur?\" said our conductor; but his exclamations\r\nwere still more enthusiastic when the magnesium ribbon lit up the\r\nmillions of arragonite crystals that covered the roof with a glistering\r\nefflorescence. Then the flashlight blazed out, as our camera got into\r\naction, and the old man was speechless with amazement. He had known the\r\ncave, boy and man, all his life, but never before had he, or anyone\r\nelse for that matter, gazed upon all its beauties. Several photographs\r\nwere secured--among them the portrait of a sleeping bat clinging to the\r\ngroining of calcite--and then the cave grew too smoky for further work.\r\nSo we went off to explore.\r\n\r\nFirst we climbed into an opening high up in the north wall. It seemed\r\nto run parallel with the main passage, and soon we beheld daylight in\r\nfront. Ere we reached the open air, however, we came to a steep drop,\r\nand found that the branch had simply brought us back to the vestibule\r\nof the cavern. Another opening, near the entrance, running due north,\r\nproved more interesting, leading eventually to a bell chamber, floored,\r\nwalled, and roofed with polished carbonate. Someone had reached this\r\npoint twenty years ago, so dates and initials testified; but there were\r\nvirgin passages branching off to left and right for us to investigate,\r\nas far as bodies of speleological slimness were admissible.\r\n\r\nA squeeze through a crevice in the east wall led into a parallel\r\ntunnel, depressingly low and painfully narrow, which seemed to run on\r\nindefinitely to the north. The soft clay floor showed it was at times\r\nthe path of a heavy stream. Northward, it shrank to a mere drain-pipe;\r\nsouthward it led by one joint and culvert to another, all at right\r\nangles, into other straight channels, all going in the same general\r\ndirection. My companion stuck fast a little way beyond the first\r\ntunnel; I pushed on like a weevil into the maze of perforations, but\r\nmet the same fate at last, not giving in, however, until I had been\r\nheld as in a vice at one point for a good five minutes, with boot\r\njammed, candle out, and no room to get my hand to the pocket where the\r\nwaterproof matches were safely stowed away.\r\n\r\nIt was still possible to see a long way ahead, by candlelight and\r\nmagnesium; and we made out that north of the known cave lies a whole\r\nnetwork of dry waterways, the principal channels running due north,\r\nroughly parallel to the Limestone escarpment in which the cave mouth\r\nopens, and all connected together by rectangular branches. One channel\r\nbrought us within view of daylight; but the crevice was too small for\r\nanything but a rabbit, and we had to return by the same arduous and\r\nabrading passages we had come by. As old Fox would have said, the\r\nthings we saw were \"very handsome,\" but we could not tempt him to enter\r\nthis uncomfortable region.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVE EXPLORING AT ABERGELE\r\n\r\n\r\nTravellers on the North-Western to Holyhead or Snowdonia are familiar\r\nwith several cave mouths that form a prominent feature in the Limestone\r\ncliffs above Lord Dundonald's castle, near the station of Llandulas.\r\nThe most conspicuous is a vast antre near the cliff-top; and legend\r\nhas it that this opens into passages running for great distances,\r\nand eventually descending beneath the sea. (Welsh cave-myths are not\r\nless extravagant than those of Derbyshire and Somerset, where stories\r\nof dogs, geese, and other animals that have made long pilgrimages\r\nunderground and come into daylight again divested of feathers or hair,\r\nare still piously cherished by the credulous.) The name attached to\r\nthis group of caves, Tanyrogo--\"under the cave\"--is derived from\r\nthe Celtic ogo or ogof, a cavern, and is almost identical with the\r\noriginal name of Wookey Hole in Somerset. A party of explorers from\r\nLiverpool and Colwyn Bay have recently carried out some researches in\r\nthe Tanyrogo caves, and in those at St. George, on the other side of\r\nAbergele; and while verifying their disbelief in the supposed extent of\r\nthe subterranean galleries, have ascertained many interesting facts as\r\nto the formation and the geological history of both series.\r\n\r\nA grassy terrace runs along the cliff face to the gaping portal of\r\nthe Ogo, the biggest of the Tanyrogo caves, which looks seaward and\r\ncommands a magnificent view over the coast and the Irish sea. The\r\nprehistoric men who doubtless lived here once showed not only good\r\ntaste in the choice of a site for their residence, but a judicious eye\r\nfor military possibilities; the place is all but impregnable, save by\r\nstarvation, the only access being by this narrow ledge, which a handful\r\nof men could defend against an army. Spanned by a noble arch is a\r\ncolossal vestibule, rock-floored and dry. But this imposing entrance\r\nis a deception--there is nothing beyond to compare with its shape and\r\nmagnitude. We swerved to the left, and at once found ourselves treading\r\na floor of wet clay, which began to ascend, and soon steepened into\r\na high bank leading up towards the roof. Creeping under an arch, we\r\nfound ourselves in a transverse fissure that may have run as far as the\r\nlegends pleased, but grew too narrow in a few feet for any human being\r\nto penetrate farther. A few rudimentary stalactites and a crust of pure\r\nwhite calcite adorned one small grotto; the rest was bare rock walls\r\nand rugged arches, springing here and there high into the darkness,\r\nin fissures that must reach very nearly to the summit of the cliff. A\r\nbranch passage dwindled away still more quickly, and so did a minor\r\nopening that looks like a side door to the main entrance.\r\n\r\nThe rock structure of the cave arches is displayed in very beautiful\r\nways in this cavern, but the most interesting feature is the remnant\r\nof an old cave floor. The cavern was evidently formed in pre-Glacial\r\ntimes, and the vast quantities of clay that plug it up almost entirely\r\nnow must have been carried in by the ice. After the glaciers had\r\nreceded, the normal agencies began their work again; a stalagmite floor\r\nwas formed by the drip of water from the roof, depositing a layer of\r\ncalcite; this in the course of time was broken down again, and now\r\nleaves a kind of high-water mark all round the walls of the cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OGO, NEAR ABERGELE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE THE OGO, NEAR ABERGELE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nThe line of the fissure creating the upward chasms inside the cave\r\ncan be traced in the external configuration of the cliff; in sundry\r\nvertical openings in the face, and in the clean-cut walls, where\r\nsheer masses have fallen away, broken at the joints. Similar joints\r\nand fissures played a part in the formation of a lower tier of caves,\r\nwhich we explored next. The first was only a yard or two wide, but very\r\nlofty, and its floor was composed of a level bed of sand and clay.\r\nThis gradually rose as we walked into the darkness, until the cave\r\nended more abruptly even than the last. We noticed pebbles of Bunter\r\nsandstone in the floor, and the next cave produced many more examples\r\nof the same stone, which must have been brought from a long distance,\r\nthe nearest strata corresponding to it being in Wirral. At the back of\r\nthis next cave a bank of cave earth and boulder clay was piled right\r\nup to the roof, so steeply that it was not too easy a climb to the\r\nsummit. Arrived there, we found no possible egress; but a horizontal\r\ntunnel, a sort of squint or hagioscope probably more than forty feet\r\nlong, gave us a peep through the rocky cliff out to the sunlight. We\r\nset out forthwith to discover the outside orifice of this curious hole,\r\nand found it came out on a ledge in the face of the cliff, hard by an\r\nopen platform which had a very queer look about it. On examination\r\nthis proved to be the floor of an old cave that had been destroyed by\r\nthe quarrymen. Half-embedded in thick clay were a number of stalagmite\r\npedestals, and a floor of stalagmite underneath several feet in depth,\r\nsurmounting a thick bed of boulder clay stuck full of Bunter pebbles.\r\nIt was obvious that the quarrymen, coming across this mass of useless\r\nmaterial, had not troubled to attack the solid layer of stalagmite\r\nabove it. The remains of stalactites and stalagmite curtains still\r\nadhered to the neighbouring cliff.\r\n\r\nThe spot is well worth visiting, if only to see this remarkable\r\nillustration of several consecutive chapters in the history of a\r\ncavern. The destructive work of the Limestone quarry, having been\r\nchecked at this particular point, exposes the whole thing as in a\r\ndiagram; and the actual evidences are there just as they were produced\r\nby the forces acting in successive epochs--the mouth of the original\r\ncave, formed perhaps in pre-Triassic times; the masses of drift\r\nthrust in by the glaciers; and the new cave floor, with its growth of\r\nstalagmites. Since the caves lie at a height of several hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level, it is fairly certain that the moving glaciers exerted\r\nan upward as well as a horizontal force, shoving the plastic masses\r\nof clay and débris into the ascending passages, and caulking up, no\r\ndoubt, a good many tributary galleries that are now unknown. The caves\r\nlook north, and the material pushed into them must have come from\r\nseaward; there is, furthermore, no rock in the adjoining districts\r\nthat could have yielded this kind of pebbles: so that it appears the\r\nstream of glaciers which flowed across from Lancashire and Cheshire,\r\nimpinging against the contrary flow of ice from Snowdonia, must be\r\nheld responsible for the presence of these dense deposits. All along\r\nthe meadow-lands between the Limestone hills and the sea a series of\r\nrisings or big springs are noticeable from the railway, forming large\r\npools. These are the outlets of the drainage that has been absorbed by\r\nthe Limestone strata, through which the water has found its way until,\r\nmeeting with an impermeable layer of rock, or reaching the plane of\r\nsaturation at sea-level, it has been forced to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE OGO, NEAR ABERGELE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nThe St. George's Caves are situated on and about a wooded hill of\r\nLimestone near the village, which adjoins the low-lying lands of Morfa\r\nRhuddlan, the scene of a murderous battle in the year 795. The Celt,\r\nwith his strong historical imagination, such a factor in national\r\nsolidarity, still remembers, though confusedly perhaps, some incidents\r\nof that calamitous fight. The old woman who pointed out the situation\r\nof the caves drew our attention to the ditch and rampart which run\r\nround the hillcrest, where it is not protected by cliffs. There, she\r\nsaid, the routed Welsh tribes had entrenched themselves and fought\r\ndesperately on until every man was put to the sword. The wood on the\r\nhilltop is full of graves, she told us, and weapons often come to light\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nA great master-joint or fissure runs across the hill towards the\r\nbattlefield, and in it lie the caves, or rather the cave, for so far\r\nas we could make out they are all parts of one stream-channel. At the\r\ntop of a cliff that is now being worked for lime is a small orifice, a\r\nmere fox's hole, blocked up against Master Reynard or the badgers that\r\noften find a home in these small caves. A hundred feet beneath it is a\r\nlarger opening, which is said to give entrance into several good-sized\r\nchambers; but that also has been carefully built up with fragments of\r\nLimestone by the quarrymen. We were driven accordingly to seek the\r\noutlet of the cave, and this we found by following the smooth, straight\r\nescarpment, produced by the fault, in a wood close to the mainroad.\r\nA large stream once issued from the cave mouth, but has since become\r\nengulfed in some internal swallet, and emerges a few yards lower down,\r\nwelling out from a funnel of crystal water some 15 feet deep. The cave\r\nitself discharges a stream only in flood-time. There, too, we were\r\nstopped from penetrating far by the beds of clay that gradually rose\r\nto the cave roof; but in this instance the deposits had been made by\r\nthe stream, and were not the results of glacial action pushing upwards.\r\nIn fact, this is a cave with quite a modern history, one still in\r\nworking order, and used as a waterway at the proper times and seasons\r\nby the stream that made it. The Tanyrogo Caves, on the other hand,\r\nhave ceased for untold ages to be actual water-channels, having been\r\ndeprived long ago by denudation above and behind them of the greater\r\npart of their drainage area. And since that remote epoch they have gone\r\nthrough the series of vicissitudes so plainly recorded in their present\r\nphysiognomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRE-GLACIAL CAVE, LLANDULAS.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVE DISCOVERIES ON THE WELSH BORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day, a Liverpool friend, who has a bungalow in the Ceiriog\r\nValley, close to Offa's Dyke, told me he had found a cave there, which\r\nhad never been explored, but was reputed to go six miles underground,\r\nto the neighbourhood of Oswestry. He invited me to come down and\r\nexplore it, and I readily agreed, on the condition that he was to seize\r\nthe opportunity to make his début as a cave explorer. On the side of\r\nthe valley where the cave lies the hill falls steeply to the Ceiriog,\r\nand the densely-wooded cliff of Limestone that bathes its foot in the\r\nriver is like a bit of Dovedale. Not so the other side of the valley,\r\nwhere different strata crop out, and the hills, with all their trees,\r\nrise more gently to the brow overlooking Llangollen.\r\n\r\nThe cave mouth is about 20 feet above the river, in a cliff facing due\r\nnorth, in which the Limestone is tilted at an angle of 45 degrees.\r\nIt is recessed within a lofty arch, but the entrance itself is low,\r\ncompelling us to creep for the first few yards. After two or three\r\nbends, the roof as well as the floor rises, and the passage opens into\r\na chamber whose floor is heaped up to a height of 10 feet with fallen\r\ndébris, thickly plastered with mud. At first the cave runs due south,\r\nbut the main axis of this chamber, which is lofty and measures about\r\n20 feet by 20, runs east-south-east. The roof rises about 20 feet\r\nhigher than the central heap of débris. Water drips occasionally, but\r\nthere are no stalactites. At the far end the passage turns south-east,\r\nand, though lofty, is narrow, the walls being parallel, and tilted at\r\nan angle of 20 degrees from the perpendicular. Then a second chamber\r\nwidens out, 50 feet long by 6 feet broad, as muddy as the former.\r\nRising 10 feet, the passage continues to the east-south-east, but\r\nthe walls converge for a time, forcing us to crawl, extended on our\r\nsides. Then it opens out again, and we climb over more heaps of débris\r\nlittering the floor, and all bedaubed with thick, tenacious clay.\r\n\r\nNow the passage becomes loftier but narrower, and progress has to be\r\nmade by keeping near the roof, the walls sloping at an angle of 30\r\ndegrees from the vertical, opening at one point into a small chamber\r\nwith a false floor of jammed rocks, then immediately closing again, and\r\nso continuing for a distance of 60 feet. The narrowness is so great\r\nthat one goes ahead only by dint of a continuous struggle against\r\nfriction. Up to this, my friend had kept close at my heels, followed by\r\nhis man. But here the only way visible was down a still narrower rift\r\nbending off to the left, and the latter found his own diameter greater\r\nthan that of the cave. We left him, and pushed obstinately forward,\r\nthough we had not seen a sign of any person's former presence for a\r\nlong distance. Nearer the cave mouth matches and candle-grease and the\r\nmarks of crawling had been plentiful, local adventurers having got in\r\nnearly 100 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE CEIRIOG.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER CEIRIOG CAVE.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nAlready we had struck the water in two or three places, but had not\r\nfound it in the main passage. Now we crossed a long pool or runnel of\r\nstagnant water, which came in from under the rocks to the south-east,\r\nand climbed into a tight little curving tunnel that led back to it in\r\na semi-circle. Beyond it, I found myself in a rift chamber, with the\r\nwater coming in from under the rocks at one end, and flowing out in\r\nlike manner at the other. There seemed to be no egress, till suddenly\r\nI noticed that the niche in which I was sitting was the end of a small\r\nhorizontal hole or dry water-pipe, striking off at right angles. But\r\nmy companion had found the tunnel too much for him. The sides bristled\r\nwith points of rock, and pressed in so close that one could only\r\nwriggle through by fractions of an inch, stretched at full length on\r\nthe left side. Now he made a stout attempt to get through underneath,\r\nin the water tunnel. I heard the sound of wallowing, and then my\r\nfriend's head and shoulders came splashing in at the bottom of the\r\ncave, his body dragging after through water and mud. But again he stuck\r\nfast, and announced that he would give the thing up.\r\n\r\nIt was not wise to go on far alone, for fear of being left by any\r\naccident without a light; but in order to make a reconnaissance\r\nfor future work I pushed through the water-pipe, and to my delight\r\nfound myself in another horizontal tunnel running parallel to the\r\nmain chamber. Crawling ahead, first over a clay-lined floor, and\r\nthen over splinters of Limestone mixed with stalagmites, I emerged\r\npresently into an open passage, 25 or 30 feet high, with the stream\r\npeacefully reposing in one long pool at the bottom. It appeared to go\r\non indefinitely, and I might have gone farther, but for the present\r\ndetermined to leave off the exploration at this point. The parallel\r\ntunnel seemed to be going straight back towards the cave mouth, and\r\nit looked as though it might form a short cut home. As a matter of\r\nfact, this was a right branch striking off from the point where our\r\nman had stuck fast. By crawling in his direction and shouting, I made\r\nhim hear, and at last saw his light through a chink only three inches\r\nwide. Fallen blocks of Limestone choked the tunnel at his end, where\r\nit leaves the main passage near the roof, and in its present state\r\nthis branch of the cave was practically invisible. We shifted several\r\nbig stones, however, and in a few minutes my friend joined me, pleased\r\nenough to find a way out that saved the discomforts of his recent\r\njourney. He had had the misfortune to array himself in white flannels,\r\nand now the state of his garments was so deplorable that he straightway\r\nhid himself in the river, like the pseudo Marquis of Carabas, until\r\nmore presentable clothing could be fetched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER CEIRIOG CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nA veteran cave-hunter from Liverpool gladly joined me in a second\r\nvisit to the Ceiriog Cavern. Our host could not be with us, but sent\r\na village youth as his substitute. This young man was very keen\r\nand plucky, and, as things turned out, saved the situation, for my\r\nspeleological friend, to his intense chagrin, failed to get through the\r\nnarrow entrance to the parallel tunnel, and the two of us had to finish\r\nthe job by ourselves. Climbing along the walls of the water-rift,\r\nwe soon found it best to wade straight through the stream bed, and\r\nfinally, when the space grew more and more restricted, to crawl through\r\nthe water. Toward the end of the rift a small tunnel broke away to the\r\nleft, and the water disturbed by our advance flowed into it and away\r\ndown a small swallet. Wriggling through, heedless of a wetting, we\r\ncame into a small chamber with four exits, each of which we explored,\r\nmarking off each with a cross or arrow to prevent our losing the route\r\nback. Every branch led eventually to other points of divergence, and\r\nultimately to small tunnels or pipes, through which the water flows\r\nin rainy weather into the head of the cavern. Having conscientiously\r\nexamined every one, without finding the mythical passage to Oswestry,\r\nwe returned to the tunnel of the swallet. One of the bifurcations, it\r\nwas interesting to discover, led back unexpectedly into the water-rift.\r\nThere were numberless chinks and fissures, and holes in the roof,\r\nleading into this network of passages, all very interesting as a\r\nconcise example of the whole history of the formation of a cave; but\r\nthe farthest point reached was, by measurement, only a little more than\r\n500 feet from the entrance. Only in places were there stalactites, and\r\nthose small ones. There were stalagmite curtains on the walls at one or\r\ntwo spots, and patches of very white amorphous tufa. Curious filaments\r\nof cave-weed, white and brown, without a vestige of leaves, abounded\r\nthroughout the cavern. Not far above the cave mouth I came across the\r\nexit of the water, a beautiful spring, pouring down into the Ceiriog, a\r\nfew yards away.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the hill, in a disused Limestone quarry, there were\r\ntraditions of a cave opening that had been covered by a landslip for\r\nsome thirty years. A man was set to work digging it out, and a small\r\nfissure was disclosed, the old channel of a tributary leading into\r\nthe middle of a cave running north-north-east and south-south-west.\r\nThe total length was 172 feet. The water apparently entered at the\r\ntop of the left passage and ran away into a low bedding cave to the\r\nright. The floor is wet clay at present, but there are traces of large\r\nstalagmites, including one handsome \"beehive\"; and the roof is covered\r\nwith beautiful white and amber stalactites. Our further attempts to\r\nuncover openings into the Limestone only brought us down to the solid\r\nrock, and we found nothing to confirm the rumour that a cave exists\r\nwhich carried a stream down to the Ceiriog, 800 feet below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLORATION OF STUMP CROSS CAVERN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explorers who have done so much work in Derbyshire and\r\nSomersetshire have also carried out extended explorations in some\r\nof the more remote caves of Yorkshire. Recently a party carried out\r\nfarther investigations than any previous explorers in Stump Cross\r\nCavern, on the moors between Wharfedale and Nidderdale. This cavern,\r\nwhich is named after the ancient boundary mark of Knaresborough\r\nForest, and is situated near the summit of the moors, 1326 feet above\r\nsea-level, 4-1/2 miles from Pateley Bridge and 11-1/2 from Skipton,\r\nwas discovered in 1843 by miners searching for lead, as was the case\r\nwith several of the Derbyshire caverns. The Greenhow lead mines are\r\nnot far off, and the ground in many parts hereabouts is riddled with\r\nold workings. No place could look more unlikely for caves than the\r\nflat field on the top of the hill, where a few steps lead down to a\r\ndoorway into the ground, close to the rough road to Grassington and\r\nAppletreewick.\r\n\r\nThe party of five, besides myself, Messrs. B. and F. Wightman, J.\r\nW. Puttrell, J. Croft, and H. Bamforth (all members of the Kyndwr\r\nClub), drove up from Bolton Abbey Station by way of Burnsall, and\r\nthrough various delays did not reach the cave mouth till nine o'clock\r\non Saturday evening. With our photographic and other apparatus we\r\ndescended at once to a level gallery 50 feet or so below the surface,\r\nwhence several passages branch off, and there we made a halt. To\r\ngive a clear general idea of the structure of this cavern is not\r\neasy. It consists of a number of galleries running in different\r\ndirections at different levels, with a few intercommunications, and\r\nmany continuations that have gradually become choked with clay and\r\nstalagmite and have for ages been impassable. Descending the steep\r\nstairway in a northerly direction one soon reaches the first of the\r\nnatural passages, which bears to the west. A gallery goes off to the\r\nright, west-south-west, and bifurcates, but is uninteresting, the earth\r\nand clay that show its proximity to the surface rendering it very\r\ndirty. In the opposite direction, east-north-east, the corridor where\r\nwe had placed the luggage and made our general rendezvous continues to\r\na distance of 120 feet, and then dwindles away into a low stalactite\r\ngrotto. Being so inaccessible and so little known, the various chambers\r\nhave never yet been christened, except with the vague and general\r\nnames of Upper Caverns and Lower Caverns, which have little meaning\r\nowing to the intricate conformation of the series. From our rendezvous\r\ntwo important tunnels, called the Lower Caverns, go off in a westerly\r\ndirection from the bottom of a natural shaft 20 feet deep. These were\r\nleft for the present whilst we went into the Middle Caverns, which\r\nstrike off to the north from the same spot, and after many turns and\r\ntwists approach the surface in the ravine of Dry Gill, south-east\r\nfrom the entrance to the caves. Many chambers and passages open out\r\nfrom this series, the largest and most beautiful being called, very\r\ninappropriately, the Top Cavern. As it leads eventually to a charming\r\npiece of cave scenery that we agreed to call the \"Bowling Alley,\" it\r\nmight well be named after this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN STUMP CROSS CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PILLAR, STUMP CROSS CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nI will now, as clearly as I can, follow the steps of the party in\r\ntheir exploration of these Middle Caverns, and proceed afterwards with\r\nthem into the other series. Descending gradually, and passing many\r\nnooks and corners where exquisite recesses are wreathed about by the\r\nivory-white incrustations on wall, roof, and floor, we stayed to drink\r\na ceremonious glass from the icy waters of Jacob's Well, a crystal\r\npool curtained in with masses of stalactite, and then passed on to one\r\nof the chief show places seen by the public, bearing the modest name\r\nof the Chapel. Its great attraction is the series of massive pillars\r\nof translucent white that seem to uphold the arching roof. In few of\r\nthe caverns that I have explored is there anything to compare with the\r\nstateliness of this pure colonnade, the cylindrical shafts of which\r\nare a good deal longer than a man's height, and modelled fantastically\r\nby the irregular deposit of the calc spar. One column in this part of\r\nthe cave measured three feet in circumference. A peculiar beauty was\r\nthe transparency of the material, a pure glassy white through which\r\nthe light of a candle shone clearly, whilst a light inside converted\r\nthe hanging folds and clusters of stalactites into a beautiful species\r\nof lantern. On the walls were folds and ridges of snowy stalagmite,\r\nand from the roof hung stalactites of all shapes and sizes, myriads\r\nof threadlike growths hanging in a lacy fringe. Onwards the arcading\r\nand the array of pillars extended into a roomy vault, the end of which\r\nstruck upwards, as already explained, south-eastwards, toward Dry\r\nGill. Though a perceptible draught comes through from the open air,\r\nand the heaps of clay-coated blocks show that a swallet is not far\r\noff above, no way can be forced through without excavation. Augmented\r\nby the arrival of two or three local friends, the party descended,\r\nafter lunch, into the Lower Caverns. Unlike the other passages, with\r\ntheir continual windings and perplexing branches, these two series\r\nof large vaults, narrow tunnels, and almost impracticable crevices\r\nmaintain a westerly direction throughout, and the few branches strike\r\noff decisively to the right or to the left. Two of us, being delayed\r\nby some trifling accident, missed the others at the bottom of the\r\nshort vertical descent, and, unaware that there were two series of\r\npassages, crept on along the first that opened. This had the appearance\r\nof an old stream-bed, the ground being littered in places with blocks\r\nof Limestone, in others clayey, and in some parts smoothed down by\r\nthe rush of a torrent. High in places, it often dwindled to a very\r\nlow passage, through which we crept and wriggled after the manner of\r\nthe serpent, ofttimes exerting no little strength to push beneath\r\nthe projections overhead. Here a shaft of glassy stalagmite, uniting\r\nfloor and roof, tried to bar the way, and there it was impossible to\r\nadvance without scraping against the vitreous threads that hung like\r\nhairs from the dripping rocks. We shouted to the others who we thought\r\nwere ahead of us, but got no reply, and after twenty minutes of this\r\npainful progression began to think of returning. Noticing a hollow\r\nin the right wall, I asked my comrade to wait while I examined it.\r\nInside was a blind passage and the round orifice of a small tunnel,\r\ninto which I thrust my head and shoulders and then crawled forward.\r\nIt was not an inviting hole, being wet and an exceedingly tight fit,\r\nand I was on the point of returning when a voice was heard faintly in\r\nthe distance. Listening intently and creeping on again, I heard the\r\nvoice more distinctly, and shouted. The voice replied from below. I\r\nquickly realised that we two had missed the others, who were following\r\na lower series of passages somewhere beneath us. Unable to turn round,\r\nand too far advanced to return up this slippery tunnel, I saw there\r\nwas nothing for it but to push on, head downwards. In a yard or two,\r\nto my unspeakable relief, the hole grew big enough to turn round in,\r\njust before I got to the end of it, and saw Messrs. Croft and Puttrell,\r\n12 feet below me, holding out their hands and inviting me to drop.\r\nThe leap was a little sensational, but I had my turn of enjoyment in\r\nwitnessing the grace with which my comrade from above, who was now\r\ncourteously invited to follow me through the water-pipe, took the jump\r\non to the clay floor of the lower tunnel.\r\n\r\nWe returned later to the other westerly passage, at the top of the\r\nwater-pipe. Examining every opening carefully, we noticed many similar\r\ncommunications between the two series, evidently proving that the upper\r\nwas a very ancient stream course that had been tapped successively\r\nuntil the lower tunnel superseded it as a waterway. Pushing ahead, we\r\nsoon realised that we had arrived at the richest part of the whole\r\ncavern, though also the most inaccessible. The roof came down bristling\r\nwith spikes and shafts of the purest calcite; the floor was one mass\r\nof crystallisation, ridged all over with the rippling lines that form\r\nas the crust grows under water. This exquisite scene was continued\r\nfor hundreds of feet, various and indescribable as a dream, whilst\r\nour march onward over the sharp crystals of the floor and through the\r\nportcullis that closed every chamber was as painful as a nightmare.\r\nLoveliest of all was a long tunnel that once held many pools of water,\r\nhalf-encrusted over with a film of carbonate. Only one of these lucid\r\nmirrors remained, but the dried-up basins were as beautiful now as\r\never, with the bottom and sides covered by a coraline growth delicate\r\nin colour as in form. At the end was a small dome-like chamber, where\r\nwe extended ourselves for a hard-earned rest before facing the toils\r\nand tribulations of the journey back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAPEL: STUMP CROSS CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\nWe thought this expedition to the lower series had exhausted the\r\nprincipal beauties of Stump Cross Cavern, but we were wrong. On our way\r\nto rejoin the other men in the Middle Cavern we were much impressed by\r\ntwo large curtains of stalactite, one of them folded and wrinkled,\r\nand the other hanging straight down without a curve, but both striped\r\nwith deep bands of crimson, orange, and golden yellow when a piece\r\nof magnesium was burnt behind them. These were equal in extent and\r\nbrilliance to anything I have ever seen, even in Cox's Cavern at\r\nCheddar. A round tunnel, ribbed and groined with glistening dripstone,\r\nand a broad low arch set with pillars and string-like stalactites\r\nstretched from top to bottom, led into the long, wide chamber that we\r\ndubbed the \"Bowling Alley,\" on account of the stumps and pedestals of\r\nstalagmite that stud the floor between the pillars. Beyond it a short\r\npassage leads into a grotto to the right, and a very difficult one\r\ncontinues some distance to the left.\r\n\r\nIt was now past three in the morning. Tired and battered to the point\r\nof exhaustion, but delighted with an exploration that far exceeded\r\nin interest all we had looked for, we returned to the cave mouth. An\r\nunpleasant-looking bull which had with great suspicion watched us\r\nmake our nocturnal entry into the regions below had, greatly to our\r\nrelief, got tired of waiting, and the coast was clear. Out of the\r\neverlasting silence and the shadows, lit so rarely by the glare of the\r\nmagnesium and the beams of the limelight, we returned again, with the\r\nsurprise that never fails, to the light of the heavens. Dusk was on\r\nthe far-extending moors and hills, daylight was creeping on over the\r\nsky, a pair of larks saluted us with a hilarious song. Our driver was\r\nsoon awake at the little inn, two furlongs away, and in the freshness\r\nof the morning we crawled down the break-neck road to Appletreewick,\r\nBolton Woods and the Wharfe growing in light before us; and then at an\r\nexhilarating pace rolled up the dale to the Red Lion at Burnsall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWALLET-HUNTING IN DERBYSHIRE\r\n\r\n\"GIANT'S HOLE\" AND \"MANIFOLD\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Sparrowpit and the head of the Winnats the old road from\r\nChapel-en-le-Frith to Castleton skirts what is, geologically, one of\r\nthe most important localities in Derbyshire. It runs along the side\r\nof a shallow upland valley, about 1200 feet above tide-level and two\r\nmiles long, which is bounded on two sides by the curve of Rushup Edge\r\nand on the other two by Elden Hill, Windy Knoll, and other Limestone\r\nacclivities. One of the great faults of the Pennine chain traverses\r\nthis valley longitudinally, the Yoredale strata having been thrown\r\ndown to the level of the Limestone, so that the middle of the valley\r\nis the boundary between the Yoredale rocks, shale grits, and milestone\r\ngrit on the north, and the Limestone plateau of Mid-Derbyshire on the\r\nsouth. The valley is completely encircled by higher ground; there\r\nis no egress for streams on the surface. Accordingly other modes\r\nof drainage are to be looked for, and they will be discovered in a\r\nnumerous series of swallets situated along the line of the fault, the\r\nwater that runs over the impervious shales perforating the Limestone\r\nas soon as it comes in contact with it. This shallow valley, in fact,\r\nis the gathering ground for the waters that pour into the abyss of\r\nthe Speedwell Cavern, traverse Peak Cavern, and make their way to the\r\nopen air at Russet Well and other springs at Castleton. That such is\r\nthe case has long been proved by observations of the temperature and\r\ncolour of the waters, and by tracing chaff and other things thrown into\r\nthe upland streams. But there exist hardly enough data to establish the\r\ntheory of the French speleologist, M. Martel, that Peak's Hole Water\r\ncomes from Perryfoot, and the water of Russet Well from Coalpit Mine,\r\nnear Sparrowpit. All that is definitely known is that these waters run\r\nthrough the massive Limestone for distances varying from two to three\r\nmiles and reappear in Castleton, 600 feet beneath. Whether they unite\r\ninto one or two large streams, which form considerable chambers and\r\ncaverns in the inaccessible region beyond the farthest known parts of\r\nSpeedwell and Peak Caverns, is an interesting question, that tempts one\r\nto answer boldly in the affirmative, since the action of underground\r\nstreams in Somerset and Yorkshire seems to justify the assumption, if\r\nwe take into account the extent of the vertical joints eaten away by\r\nthe water in its descent of 600 feet, and the effects of periodical\r\nfloods. In Somerset, in a situation exactly similar, two caves of 600\r\nfeet fall and 2000 feet horizontal measurement have recently been\r\ndiscovered by opening similar swallet-holes. Is there any hope of\r\nfinding such hypothetical cavern or caverns here by exploring, and if\r\nnecessary opening artificially, any of the swallets between Perryfoot\r\nand Giant's Hole? The investigations recently carried out by a friend\r\nand myself do not make us hopeful that if there are such caverns they\r\nwill ever be made accessible.\r\n\r\nWe began our work at Giant's Hole, which opens in the bottom of a\r\nlittle gorge between Peak's Hill and Middle Hill. The brooklet that\r\nruns in at the cave mouth was very low, and we passed almost dryshod\r\nover the rough stones that cover the stream-bed for some 60 feet.\r\nGiant's Hole has an arched entrance about seven feet high, and the\r\nfirst part of the cave retains the same form. Then the walls contract,\r\nand the cave takes the shape of a deep and narrow canyon, cut through\r\nsolid rock, with the stream coursing along at the bottom over little\r\nfalls and waterslides and through pools that are not easy to pass\r\nwithout a wetting. One hundred and fifty feet from the entrance to the\r\ncave is a lofty rift, near the top of which an upper gallery turns\r\nwest, the general direction of the main passage being southerly.\r\nPassing this, we followed the stream downhill for another fifty or\r\nsixty yards, and were then brought to a standstill by a partial choke.\r\nAt this point a quantity of stones and gravel comes within two feet of\r\nthe roof, and the water is dammed back in a pool a foot deep, so that\r\nthere is barely a foot of clear space between water and roof.\r\n\r\nReturning to the steep climb to the upper gallery, we scaled the wet\r\nand slippery rocks, and found ourselves on a shelf over the canyon.\r\nThe shelf gave ingress to the gallery, which rose gently in a westerly\r\ndirection, with frequent twists and turns, and then turned north. In\r\n150 feet it divided. We scrambled on; but all the branches evidently\r\napproached the surface of the ground, becoming earthy, and we soon\r\nfound it impossible to get any farther. This upper level, which for\r\nour purposes was of less interest than the lower, is incrusted with\r\ndeposits throughout its length of 80 or 90 yards. There are stalagmite\r\ncurtains and sheets of tufa on the walls, the older rocks on the floor\r\nare cemented together with a crust of polished stalagmite, and some\r\nof the boulders are covered with shining enamel. We found it best to\r\nuse an Alpine rope in getting back to the lower level, the ledges\r\nunderneath not being easy to find by candlelight. Outside the sun was\r\nshining brightly, and the light that streamed in at the cave mouth,\r\nthrough the ferns and flowers and grasses that encircled it, was\r\nstained a fairy-like green.\r\n\r\nContinuing our way through the gorge between the sharp Limestone\r\nknoll of Peak's Hill and the bulkier Middle Hill, we followed a stream\r\nthat comes down from Rushup Edge, perforates the Limestone base of\r\nPeak's Hill, and comes out on the other side at a small cave. In three\r\nfurlongs this stream is swallowed under a cliff some 20 feet high, the\r\ningress at present being through a series of holes, where the water\r\nmakes an intermittent roaring, almost like the throb of a hydraulic\r\nram, as if a siphon were momentarily discharging. Older rifts are\r\nseen in the same line of cliffs, and can be penetrated for 30 feet,\r\nbut are now deserted by the water save at flood-time. Farther on is\r\na deep depression in the hillside, big enough to engulf a house. It\r\nis supposed locally to have been produced by the falling in of a cave\r\nroof, but it is more probably an independent swallet, one of a series,\r\nnearly all funnel-shaped and long out of working order, that lie along\r\na higher level in the Limestone than those that occupy the line of\r\ndemarcation from the shales. The biggest of them is Bull Pit, which\r\nwe come to later. Next to the last pair of large openings into which\r\nstreams are running, and which may be called the Peak's Hill Swallets,\r\nsince their waters rise out of Peak's Hill, we come to a large\r\nirregular series of trough-shaped hollows converging on another swallet\r\nat this same geological border-line. The openings here are all little\r\nones. But the next swallet has a cave above it, into which we entered.\r\nIt does not go far, but it has two ascending branches that can be\r\ntraced to two small depressions in the Limestone where tiny affluents\r\nhave percolated and cut for themselves little tunnels in the rock.\r\nThe next swallet beyond this has but a small opening, although the\r\nhollow cut out by its rivulets through the shales is hundreds of square\r\nyards in area. An abrupt cliff walls in the hollow on the Limestone\r\nside, only a few paces from which are naked patches of Yoredale rocks,\r\nclearly defining the boundary of the two series.\r\n\r\nWe now came to one of the most interesting openings that we have met\r\nwith. It lies about 200 yards north of Bull Pit. As often happens,\r\nimmediately above the swallet, in the Limestone, is a deep chasm almost\r\nperforating the escarpment. At the base of the escarpment is a rounded\r\narchway with a turbulent stream running in. After securing a photograph\r\nwe enter, and make our way down stream easily for a little distance;\r\nthen the cave twists and narrows, and at a distance of 40 feet or so\r\nwe are disappointed to find the channel too confined for us to force\r\nour way farther. Outside we had observed that the basin-shaped area\r\nhad been flooded not long ago, and inside the vegetable débris that\r\nwas plastered over the walls and roof showed that the swallet must\r\nhave been completely choked during the recent wet weather. But the\r\npeculiarity of this swallet was that the solid mass of rock through\r\nwhich the stream had carved its way was not ordinary Limestone, but\r\nbeautifully veined and crystalline like marble, and its surface smooth\r\nand polished. It had very much the same appearance as the marmorised\r\nLimestone found in the neighbourhood of intrusive lavas, such as those\r\nnear Tideswell. By the action of the water it had been sculptured into\r\nfantastic shapes; in one place a corner had been cut through and a\r\nsmall pillar left, joined to the rock at top and bottom. We scrambled\r\nwith some difficulty into the chasm behind the swallet. At the bottom,\r\non the same side as the existing swallet, was the broad and lofty arch\r\nof a cave, which went only a few yards in, otherwise it would have\r\nbroken through the escarpment. Right above the keystone of the arch was\r\na weathered group of stalactites hanging from a ledge, and under them\r\nthe broken stalagmite floor of a tiny grotto. It is a rare thing to\r\nfind such deposits in the open air, and doubtless it indicates that the\r\nchasm was formed by the destruction of a larger cave. A thick deposit\r\nof earthy mud covered the floor, and at one side a big hole penetrated\r\nthis to a depth of six feet, the work of a stream that had perhaps not\r\nrun for ages. This deposit, though dry, was so soft that I nearly sank\r\nthrough into the hole. We found four birds' nests in this cave mouth,\r\nwith eggs and young in them, and were disappointed not to come across\r\nthe egg of a cuckoo that flew out the moment before we entered. In the\r\nwiry grass not far away from the top of the cavity we discovered a\r\nlark's nest with two eggs in it.\r\n\r\nBull Pit lies in the wood just above this opening, nearer the road.\r\nIt is a great open abyss, walled on three sides by crags of Limestone\r\nnearly a hundred feet high, and with trees growing all round the\r\nedges. This, no doubt, is a very ancient swallet that has not been\r\nin operation for ages--belongs, perhaps, to the same period as Elden\r\nHole, which opens 200 or 300 feet higher, a mile away, on Elden Hill. A\r\nlittle way on, near Perryfoot, we come in sight of another very ancient\r\ncavity, on the side of Gautries Hill. It is a gaping pit about 70 feet\r\ndeep, with a noble arch inside, spanning the entrance to a broad cave.\r\nAt present the cave mouth is silted up with sand and clay. All these\r\nrocky openings are the lurking-places of beautiful ferns and mosses;\r\nthe feathery fronds of the Limestone polypody, the late primroses,\r\nvarious saxifrages, and the delicate foliage of herb robert making a\r\nbrave show. The wilder birds take refuge there. A crow flew out of the\r\nhole on Gautries Hill, and one day on approaching Elden Hole I was\r\nstartled by a dense cloud of jackdaws, more than a hundred, suddenly\r\nrushing out. Farther down, from 50 to 100 feet lower, a host of\r\nstarlings had built their nests on the walls of the chasm. Disturbed,\r\nthey came flying up in twos and threes, beating the air in painful\r\nefforts to wing their way straight up and out of the hole.\r\n\r\nAt Perryfoot a stream is engulfed which M. Martel considers to be\r\nthe source of Peak's Hole Water, and to be identical with the stream\r\nthat flows through the inmost passages of Peak Cavern. It now runs\r\ninto a cleft that is too small to be explored. But at a comparatively\r\nrecent date it was swallowed in a number of large fissures in a\r\ncrescent-shaped wall of Limestone 100 yards away. Most of these\r\nopenings are impracticable, but at the extreme east I had already\r\nreconnoitred a promising cleft which we now proceeded to examine\r\nthoroughly. This complicated swallet, with the passages behind it,\r\nis known locally as \"Manifold.\" Going east for 35 feet, the fissure\r\ndivides, one passage striking up towards the surface and the other\r\nturning south. We soon had to crawl, the passage being very low,\r\nnarrow, and lined with objectionable stones. After 30 feet more we\r\ncame to a wider place, with a sort of chimney on one side. Here was\r\nthe sole mark of humanity that we found in this cave, a stake that had\r\napparently been used to climb into the chimney. Nothing was gained\r\nby climbing it, so we squeezed our way along the main passage. Now\r\nthe tunnel grew into a high but narrow canyon where we could stand\r\nupright, then it dwindled to a tunnel again, generally descending, but\r\noccasionally rising in what was once a siphon. We passed one or two\r\nbranches, at the most important of which the principal tunnel curved\r\nto the left and descended a little more steeply over some small ledges\r\nand basins brimming with water. We began to feel sanguine about the\r\nwished-for cavern, but presently the diameter of the tunnel grew so\r\nsmall that we could not advance another yard. My companion was some\r\ndistance behind with his candle out, and I would not make a move until\r\nhe had got it relighted, the consequences of both candles going out at\r\nonce being unpleasant and possibly dangerous. For a long way we could\r\nnot turn round, and had to crawl feet foremost. Just after repassing\r\nthe junction my companion shouted that we were going wrong. He did\r\nnot recognise the passage. I remained at the junction whilst he went\r\nfarther and ascertained that it was the right channel after all. Then\r\nI examined the branch. It ascended 20 feet and then divided, the left\r\nbranch, which was earthy, plainly striking up to the surface, the right\r\nbranch going back towards the swallet. Undoubtedly there must be quite\r\na labyrinth of dry water channels to correspond with the numerous\r\nseries of openings in the cliff, but the one we explored seemed to be\r\nthe largest and most practicable. Very tired and hot, not to mention\r\nthe dirt, we made our way back to the exit, glad to feel that our day's\r\nwork was done.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that had impressed us most during our explorations was\r\nthat all these swallets and water channels are cut through solid rock.\r\nOnly when the rocks are shattered or disintegrated, as in the cases\r\nalluded to in Somerset, would there be any possibility of enlarging a\r\nswallet artificially. And though we had penetrated to a distance of\r\n400 feet at Manifold we had not found the passages growing more roomy\r\nnor enlarged by the accession of tributaries. So far, the prospect\r\nof opening up the large fissures and chambers that must surely exist\r\ndeeper in the rock seems unfavourable, unless the main channel of\r\nGiant's Hole can be unblocked.\r\n\r\n     E. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORING NEW CAVES IN DERBYSHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new and exciting game of cave-exploring has been pursued so\r\nstrenuously during the last four years that one would almost think\r\nthe possibilities of fresh discoveries had been exhausted. When a\r\nlittle while ago, therefore, rumours came in of a big cavern in\r\nLathkill Dale, so big that people were said to have been lost in its\r\nrecesses, they were received not a little incredulously. But after\r\nthe usual allowances had been made for exaggeration and myth, and\r\nthe alleged casualties reduced to the misfortunes of a sheep-dog who\r\nspent fourteen days in the cavern, probably rock-bound on a ledge, it\r\nstill appeared that there was something worth exploring. Accordingly\r\ntwo friends, Messrs. W. H. and G. D. Williams, who were residing near\r\nMatlock, kindly undertook to find the cave or caves, and see what was\r\nto be done; and a native of Middleton was commissioned to make further\r\ninquiries. First, a letter arrived with the disappointing intelligence\r\nthat there was no cave on the Lathkill, nothing but old mine workings:\r\nbut hard on its heels came a wire to say that a cave had been located\r\nand was being explored tentatively. Then further messages arrived with\r\nmention of another opening, but which was the reputed great cavern was\r\na question to be settled only by a regular exploration.\r\n\r\nA day was fixed for the campaign, and my section of the party drove\r\nup early in the morning from Bakewell Station on the Midland. Our\r\nfriends were waiting at the head of Ricklow Dale, a mile below the\r\nlittle village of Thornyash, and we proceeded without delay down that\r\nstreamless canyon, first over smooth greensward between the grim\r\nLimestone walls, then hopping from point to point of huge, close-packed\r\nfragments, until we reached the uppermost cave mouth. It has a very\r\nimposing entrance, solid piers supporting a massive lintel, about 20\r\nfeet wide. It opens in the west cliff of Ricklow Dale, at a height\r\nof 690 feet above sea-level, and is evidently the source at times of\r\na large stream. Ricklow Dale is really the upper part of Lathkill\r\nDale, above the junction with Cales Dale, and the head streams of the\r\nLathkill originally flowed down it from the neighbourhood of Monyash.\r\nBut at a later period, seemingly, the stream betook itself to an\r\nunderground course, until it emerged into the open from this cave.\r\nAt the present time the cave is swept by water only when the deeper\r\ncavities of the rock overflow. This happened, for instance, a few weeks\r\nago, when the cave discharged a considerable stream, and was for the\r\ntime being quite impenetrable to man. As the Messrs. Williams had been\r\ninto this cavern a day or two before, we left it for the present, in\r\norder to try some unexplored openings farther down the dale.\r\n\r\nOn the same side of the dale they had detected the entrance to\r\nsomething, whether cave or mine they knew not, covered in by stones and\r\nearth. With pick and crowbar an entrance was soon exposed, not much\r\nlarger than a badger's hole, and we crept through. At once it became\r\nevident that the hole was not a natural one; it was no \"self-cave,\"\r\nas the country people say, but an ordinary level or a sough draining\r\na lead mine. A pool of water filled the tunnel from side to side,\r\nstretching away into the distance; and as we preferred, if wading were\r\nnecessary, to postpone it as long as we could, we left this alone for\r\nthe present, and went on with our quest at two other spots in the\r\nentrance to Cales Dale. Needless to say, we had missed no opportunity\r\nof cross-examining the inhabitants of the district, but the results\r\nhad been absurdly inaccurate and conflicting. Already a crowd of\r\nrustic onlookers had gathered round, but the only individual among\r\nthem who knew anything about the region inside was the afore-mentioned\r\nsheep-dog, who could tell us nothing. He, too, was the only one who\r\nshowed any inclination to join our underground party. In the upper\r\nCales Dale Cavern, as we named it, he actually went ahead of us, and\r\nput our candles in jeopardy with the spirited wagging of his tail.\r\n\r\nThis cave is doubtless a very ancient channel of the Cales Dale Water,\r\nwhich now runs through hidden crevices till it meets the Lathkill;\r\nthe span of its antiquity may be gauged by the fact that Cales Dale\r\nhas been cut 200 feet deeper, and the cave left high and dry, since\r\nit was a regular stream-course. I say dry in a comparative sense, for\r\nwe quickly found ourselves confronted by a short passage of extreme\r\ndampness. The main channel runs west for 150 feet, and then divides,\r\nboth branches dwindling rapidly to mere water-pipes. But near the\r\nentrance a branch strikes off to the right. Although the roof came\r\ndown on our backs as we crawled, we managed to keep just above the\r\nsurface of a shallow pool that lay in the middle: but a second pool was\r\nalmost entirely mopped up by our journey to and fro. The passage ended\r\nin a chamber where two can stand upright. Every bit of this little\r\nnook is covered with a creamy-white and brownish coating of amorphous\r\ncarbonate. It is like a small empty shrine, with heavy curtains flowing\r\nover its walls, their folds and ridges flecked with innumerable scaly\r\nprojections, like some delicate frilling. The rest of the cave is\r\ndevoid of charm, though there are interesting masses of white tufa on\r\nthe walls, as soft as putty.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the dale, almost exactly under and parallel to this\r\nupper cave, is a larger one, which we called the Lower Cales Dale\r\nCavern. It is entirely concealed by bushes and nettles, and we had\r\nto remove a mass of blocks and detritus before we laid bare the two\r\nentrances. Even then, room could not be made for the broad-shouldered\r\nmember of the party to get in. At the end of 15 feet of very tight\r\nwriggling there was more head room. We were in a straight tunnel,\r\narched as evenly as a culvert, the floor covered with the gravelly\r\ndeposits of a stream. Evidently it is a channel still used frequently\r\nby the Cales Dale Water. It ran due west for 300 feet, with room in\r\nmost places for us to crawl on hands and knees: then it bent one\r\npoint to the north. Here the stream had thrown up a low dam, behind\r\nwhich it had bored a series of holes on the south side, through which\r\nmost of it gets away. Soon a wall of rock, shaped like the steps of\r\na weir, confronted us, at the top of which we found ourselves in a\r\nwide, irregular chamber, the height of whose roof varied from 6 feet\r\nto 18 feet. We called it the Pot Hole Cavern, because of the number\r\nof water-worn cavities in the roof. The biggest of these cavities\r\nappearing to give entrance to an upper gallery, I climbed into it with\r\nthe aid of a comrade's shoulder. It contained a pretty grotto, lined\r\nwith incrustations, but led to nothing. Deep horizontal fissures yawned\r\non every side of the Pot Hole Chamber, and vertical joints split the\r\ninterposing strata. All the exits, however, came to an end speedily\r\nexcept two, one extending a point east of south, the other a point east\r\nof north. I explored the northern branch before my friends arrived. It\r\nhad several short ramifications, in some of which there were trails of\r\nrabbits, and other evidences of a communication with the surface, such\r\nas pieces of sodden wood and deposits of soil; but it gave ingress for\r\nbarely 50 feet. The other branch seemed more important, and as we were\r\ntired out and hungry, we left it until we had returned to the dale for\r\nrest and lunch, a waste of time, unfortunately, for it ran only for 100\r\nfeet farther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICKLOW CAVE IN FLOOD.\r\n\r\n_Photo by G. D. Williams._]\r\n\r\nWe crept over a pavement of fractured blocks, into a broad, low passage\r\nthat seemed to have been hewn by giants out of the solid Limestone.\r\nAll around were the marks of a powerful, swirling current, that had\r\nsplit and torn the rocks asunder, and bored its way through their\r\njoints; yet not a grain of sand or a speck of mud was visible on their\r\ncleaned and polished surface. Fissures and passages twisted away at the\r\nside, but returned in a few yards to the main corridor. In the roof\r\nwere discernible the clean-cut hollows whence slabs of Limestone had\r\nfallen that still cumbered the floor. The large chamber that we reached\r\nfinally was bestrewn and heaped up with such masses, and all the ways\r\nof egress save one were entirely blocked up. This very soon came to an\r\nabrupt termination in a bell-shaped cavity, floored with a crust of\r\nstalagmite. But there were narrow fissures, a few inches only in width,\r\nrunning away in many directions; a strong draught made the candles\r\ngutter; and the occasional presence of great volumes of water was made\r\nevident by the damage done to some of the incrustations. There was no\r\nsign or sound of flowing water now; the silence was as profound and\r\nimpressive as the darkness. Yet this rock-strewn chamber was once the\r\nbirthplace of a river. Hither, from countless fissures, the streamlets\r\ngathered together and poured through the hidden places of the hill, now\r\nin a rippling brook, and now in a torrent, crashing and rending. At\r\npresent the Cales Dale stream finds its way to the Lathkill river by\r\nstill more secret channels. But at no infrequent times, even yet, the\r\ntorrent thunders over the waterfall in the Pot Hole Cavern, the swallet\r\nis inundated, and a flood pours on through the long tunnel, and so into\r\nthe open stream-course in the dale, now dried up and covered with\r\nvegetation. Proofs of this were legible all around us.\r\n\r\nReturning up the dale, we closed the mouth of the artificial level, and\r\nwent back to the Ricklow Cavern. Although the portal is so majestic,\r\nthe passage becomes anything but commodious at the end of a few paces.\r\nOnce more we had to crawl over hard, water-worn rock, deeply fissured\r\nand thrown out of the horizontal; our galled knees and elbows could\r\nscarcely be induced to go at all, and the pace was miserably slow.\r\nThen the roof came down so close in a horizontal fissure of huge\r\nextent, that there was nothing for it but to wriggle. My friends had\r\nascertained that 280 feet of this work leads into a lofty chamber. It\r\nis one of those long, vertical fissures, not wide but enormously high,\r\nthat are common in the Castleton caves. There were indications of\r\ngalleries overhead, but we were too much exhausted to attempt climbing\r\nwithout a ladder. Only one exit was practicable, which led in 20 feet\r\ninto just such another hollow, but still wider and uglier of aspect.\r\nFilling the cavity to a height of 30 feet was a mountain of shattered\r\nrocks, flung together pell-mell and wedged loosely. When we climbed\r\nit, the light of our candles showed that the structure was hollow, and\r\nhardly more durable in appearance than a house of cards. Some of the\r\nrocks were held by points and corners, swinging on their long axes; a\r\ntouch sent others clattering down, as we crept with the utmost caution\r\nup the adjoining wall. It was as if the interior of the hill had been\r\nrent apart by an earthquake, and the headlong stream of rocks caught\r\nsuddenly and held by the closing in of the fracture. We clambered to\r\nthe summit of this hollow mass of ruin, and lit some magnesium wire.\r\nThe formless walls went up into a dark void above us, their ledges\r\nfringed with glistening spikes and tendrils of transparent stalactite,\r\nrevealed by the glare. There had been visitors here before. Scratched\r\non the walls, but partially coated over by a crystalline enamel, were\r\nthe initials \"H. B.--R. A.,\" and the date 1817; other scrawls were\r\nindecipherable. No doubt this was the cave whose legendary renown had\r\nreached our ears. Getting down our shattered staircase was a more\r\nformidable job than the ascent. One stone, as big as a table, rocked\r\nlike a see-saw when we set foot on it.\r\n\r\nStalactites were not numerous in these caves, which are not only very\r\nhumid, but continually swept by water. Animal remains were plentiful,\r\nall recent, bones being carried in by beasts of prey and deposited\r\nby floods. As this process must have been going on for ages, the two\r\nCales Dale caverns would probably yield good results to palæontological\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nA comic incident cheered my fatigued comrades when we regained the\r\nopen air. In the morning I had brought my family up from Bakewell\r\nStation for a day in the country, a work of supererogation that now\r\nplaced me in a curious predicament. The waggonette had gone off to\r\npick them up for the early train, and, to my distress, I found the\r\ndriver had relieved us of all the luggage, including the rücksack\r\nwhich held my clothes, not to mention boots, pipe, and railway ticket.\r\nThe alternative stared me in the face of proceeding to town in slimy\r\noveralls or in attire of dangerous slightness. But the broad-shouldered\r\nfriend came to the rescue with his cave jacket, a garment that fell\r\nabout me like a baggy greatcoat, hiding the worst deformities, and with\r\nbattered hobnailers at one extremity, and a cap that had more stiff\r\nclay than cloth in it at the other, I made the best of my way home\r\nunder the cover of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO MITCHELSTOWN CAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nMitchelstown Cave, the largest ever discovered in the British Isles,\r\nis not situated at the town of that name, in county Cork, but 10 miles\r\naway, in Tipperary, on the road to Cahir. Its entrance is in a small\r\nLimestone hill in the broad vale of the Blackwater, midway between the\r\nKnockmealdown Mountains and the Sandstone ridges and tables of the\r\nGaltees. The cave was laid open in the course of quarrying operations\r\nin 1833, from which time to the present the work of exploration has\r\ngone on progressively, if at long intervals, and may, perhaps, continue\r\nuntil the extent of the passages known is considerably enlarged. It\r\nseems now to be entirely forgotten that the spot has been famous from\r\ntime immemorial for a wonderful stalactite cavern. In October 1777,\r\nArthur Young was taken into a cave, known as Skeheenarinky, after the\r\ntownland, but the old Irish name of which was Oonakareaglisha. \"The\r\nopening,\" he says, \"is a cleft of rock in a Limestone hill, so narrow\r\nas to be difficult to get into it. I descended by a ladder of about\r\ntwenty steps, and then found myself in a vault of 100 feet long and\r\n50 or 60 high: a small hole, on the left, leads from this a winding\r\ncourse of, I believe, not less than half an Irish mile.\" He goes on to\r\ndescribe the beautiful scenery of the cave, which, he says, is much\r\nsuperior to the Peak Cavern in Derbyshire, \"and Lord Kingsborough, who\r\nhas viewed the Grot d'Aucel in Burgundy, says that it is not to be\r\ncompared with it.\"[5] The odd thing is that the very existence of this\r\ncavern seems to have been forgotten since the discovery of its much\r\nfiner neighbour. Yet the trees and brushwood guarding its mouth are in\r\nfull view of the well-frequented entrance to the other cave; and Dr.\r\nLyster Jameson, who was with Monsieur Martel on his visit in 1895, told\r\nme some years ago that an opening had been pointed out to him into a\r\nlower series of caves, which I have little hesitation in identifying\r\nwith Young's cavern and the cave mouth I allude to.\r\n\r\n [5] Arthur Young's _Tour in Ireland_; ed. by A. W. Hutton. 2 vols.\r\n Bell, 1892. See pages 464-465, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GREAT PILLAR: MITCHELSTOWN CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FAIRY LANTERN: MITCHELSTOWN CAVERN.\r\n\r\n_Photo by E. A. Baker_.]\r\n\r\nDr. C. A. Hill and I visited the spot in August 1905, intending to\r\ngo through all the accessible parts of the huge series now known\r\ncollectively as Mitchelstown Cave, and also to examine the series\r\nreferred to by Dr. Jameson, who had been unable to undertake their\r\nexploration. Our impression was that little or nothing was known of\r\nthe latter series, and it was not until after our return from Ireland\r\nthat we were startled and puzzled by turning up an account in _The\r\nPostchaise Companion_ (1805 ed., pp. 301, 302) of a cave in this place\r\nalready known and celebrated thirty years before the discovery of the\r\nMitchelstown Cave. The explanation probably is that the guides find\r\none cave a more profitable investment than two. To show the second (or\r\nrather the first, since the other is the usurper) would involve twice\r\nas much labour, but would hardly bring in twice the income. Since 1833,\r\nthen, the original cavern has been suppressed, so successfully that\r\neven the omniscient Baddeley never suspected that there are two series,\r\nalthough he had read Young's description and confused it with the\r\nother. Dr. Hill let me down a few feet into the old cave-mouth, just\r\nsuch a narrow slit as Young depicts; but we found that the rock was cut\r\naway immediately beneath, and without more hauling power, the only way\r\nto get down was to use a long ladder, and this we could not obtain.\r\nThe guide told us that the hole led into nothing of any interest, and\r\nthat the entrance had been used as a receptacle for deceased dogs\r\nand other excreta. This effectually took away any wish to pursue our\r\nresearches in that direction for the present. Still, the old cave ought\r\nnot to be lost sight of; and we propose, if no one else undertakes the\r\nwork, to explore the lower series on some future visit to Ireland. The\r\nunscientific explorers of a hundred years ago may have left discoveries\r\nto future workers as important as those which remained for so many\r\nyears after the early explorations in the neighbouring great cave.\r\n\r\nWhat was done in the latter during the first year after the discovery\r\nmay be read in an article by Dr. Apjohn in the _Dublin Penny Journal_\r\nfor December 27, 1834, an article reproduced from the _Dublin\r\nGeological Journal_, vol. i. Dr. Apjohn carried out a most elaborate\r\nand painstaking survey to points considerably beyond the second\r\ngreat cavity, now known as the \"House of Lords,\" but failed to reach\r\n\"O'Leary's Cave,\" the key of the farther ramifications, or to explore\r\nthe tunnels connected with \"The River.\" His plan, worked out to scale,\r\nand showing the differences of level with great minuteness, remained\r\nthe only map of the cave until M. Martel's survey in 1895. Meanwhile\r\nvarious adventurers had got to more distant points, particularly to\r\nthe long chain of caverns running east to Brogden's, at the end of\r\nwhich M. Martel's chart stops. The French explorer does not seem to\r\nhave broken any fresh ground; but his plan, which appeared in _The\r\nIrish Naturalist_ for April 1896, with an account of his visit, was a\r\nbrilliant achievement, especially when the short time at his disposal\r\nis considered, six hours for the whole of the cavern. Parts of this\r\nchart were only hastily sketched in, either from a rapid survey or\r\nfrom information supplied by the guide, as M. Martel explained to me in\r\na conversation some time ago, and errors of detail were, under these\r\nconditions, unavoidable. For instance, \"O'Leary's Cave\" is much larger\r\nthan appears on the plan, and the \"Chimney\" is not situated at the\r\nfar end of a passage, but actually opens in the floor of \"O'Leary's\r\nCave.\" The caves running east, again--O'Callaghan's and Brogden's--are\r\nnot such a simple series of straight passages as they seem on the\r\nchart; our guide had considerable difficulty in threading his way\r\namong the various bifurcations. As will transpire later, there is a\r\nmystery connected with the name of \"Cust's Cave,\" the real Cust's being\r\nin a totally different part of the series, and a different chamber\r\naltogether in shape. Unfortunately we did not go prepared to carry out\r\nany survey, believing that all this had been done; so that we can at\r\nthe most point out some places where the existing plans are at fault.\r\nWe were also unfortunate in not being prepared to take a large number\r\nof photographs, the accounts we had read not leading us to anticipate\r\nthe actual grandeur and extent of the scenery. M. Martel compares the\r\nMitchelstown Cave with such famous continental caverns as those of\r\nAdelsberg, Padirac, Dargilan, and Han-sur-Lesse, and it comes off but\r\npoorly in such a comparison. I have seen his lantern slides of these\r\ncaves, and after exploring all the most beautiful caves discovered as\r\nyet in England, I venture to say there is not one English cave that\r\nwould not come off badly if set beside any of these. Compared, however,\r\nwith other British caverns, that of Mitchelstown can hold its own\r\neasily; though individual chambers may be surpassed, there is nothing\r\nlike the same extent of brilliant subterranean scenery anywhere else in\r\nthese islands.\r\n\r\nThe tourist portion of the cavern, a fraction of the whole, but yet\r\na considerable extent of underground passages, is deservedly much\r\nfrequented. The spacious vault, nicknamed the \"House of Commons,\" vies\r\nin dimensions and dignity with those in the Peak of Derbyshire, but\r\nit is far surpassed by the \"House of Lords.\" Seventeen massy columns\r\nof pure white stalactite, surmounting enormous cones of terraced\r\nstalagmite, tower from floor to roof of this impressive dome, some\r\n140 feet in span and 70 feet high. The grandeur of its height is lost\r\nsomewhat through the mountain of fallen blocks that rises from the\r\nentrance almost to the apex of the roof. Behind this vast accumulation\r\na sort of ambulatory runs round under the walls, opening here and there\r\ninto side chapels and irregular cavities, all bountifully adorned with\r\nthe fairy-like work of the Limestone carbonate. The so-called \"Tower of\r\nBabel\" is a majestic pillar rising from the summit of a pyramidal mass\r\nof stalagmite, 40 feet in circumference, that being also the measure\r\nof its total height. A crowd of other Limestone freaks, some aptly and\r\nsome incongruously nicknamed, and many extremely beautiful, are found\r\nin this chamber.\r\n\r\nThe cavities and passages that lie to the north-east of the first great\r\nchamber are not often visited. They start from \"Sadlier's Cave,\" which\r\nis not large but bewilderingly picturesque, and contains a superb\r\npillar, \"Lot's Wife,\" almost of the prodigious size of the \"Tower.\"\r\nThe \"Kingston Gallery\" is a straight rift, nearly 300 feet long, but\r\nonly two or three feet wide, with sheets of snowy white sweeping down\r\nthe walls, and breaking into whole garlands of scrolls and pennons and\r\ncurtains, which in places have been thrown right across the gallery,\r\ndividing it into lofty cells. Manholes, actually, had to be cut through\r\nthese diaphanous partitions to create a passage. From the cave at the\r\nend, a lower passage, the Sand Cave, comes back in a parallel direction\r\nto the point of junction, and from the quantities of fine sand on\r\nits bed, was evidently an important stream-course after the Kingston\r\nGallery was drained of its waters. It has one unique feature, the\r\nsuccession of parallel rifts, called the \"Closets,\" which are connected\r\ntogether by rents in their dividing walls. Some of these are extremely\r\nnarrow, and by candlelight it is impossible to see any limit to their\r\nheight, depth, or length. Similar widenings of the master joints and\r\ndegradation of the Limestone separating them, are a special feature of\r\nthe Mitchelstown Cave, and the key to its ground-plan, with its maze of\r\nright-angles.\r\n\r\nThe great eastern vault, the Garret, which is only 19 feet below the\r\nlevel of the entrance, does not fall, as stated by M. Martel, towards a\r\nseries of choked swallets, that originally carried the waters farther\r\ndown, but rises towards inlets from the surface. Its fretted roof has\r\nfallen in at the upper end. A little to the south is a nameless series\r\nof charming vestibules, grottoes, and tunnels, meandering towards the\r\ninsignificant lakelet called the \"River.\" Here we spent the whole of\r\nour first day. It is possible, we learned, to reach the easternmost\r\nseries of caverns by this route, which also takes one into the square\r\ncavity designated as \"Cust's Cave\" on M. Martel's chart. We chose the\r\nother way, that is, through the passage from the \"House of Lords\" to\r\nthe \"Cathedral.\"\r\n\r\nIn the tangle of contrary passages into which this leads we lost\r\nourselves several times, in the absence of the guide, and only\r\nrecovered the thread by careful observation with the compass.\r\nEventually we found the way into \"O'Leary's Cave,\" which struck us as\r\none of the most impressive chambers in the whole cavern. It is not\r\nonly much larger than is shown on the plan, but different in shape.\r\nApparently it is the most recent of all in formation, although this may\r\nbe only an appearance caused by the falling in of the roof. Unlike the\r\nother parts, where every bit of débris is sealed down by a glistening\r\nlayer of stalagmite, this great cavity is heaped high with loose\r\nfragments, as free from incrustation as if the ceiling had collapsed\r\nyesterday. So wild and vast is the configuration of \"O'Leary's Cave\"\r\nthat, standing on the lower side and looking across a depression in\r\nthe middle to the ascending ground opposite, one fancied oneself, in\r\nthe dim candlelight, gazing across a valley to a range of hills in the\r\ndistance. We spent some time vainly searching for the horizontal tunnel\r\nsupposed to end at the \"Chimney,\" and before the guide joined us were\r\nlucky enough to hit upon a string of chambers that seem never to have\r\nbeen entered before. These run, so far as we could make out without\r\nactual measurement, right over the O'Callaghan series. In fact there\r\nwere openings in the floor which we might have explored but for the\r\naggressive and tenacious clay bedaubing everything, apparently leading\r\ndown to these nether passages. Brilliant draperies swept down to the\r\nbold masses of stalagmite below the walls, and long crystalline wands\r\nhung from the roof in thousands, so that we could not move without\r\ncommitting havoc in this pendulous forest.\r\n\r\nConducted by the guide, we now descended the \"Chimney\" into the\r\ntortuous passages leading to the \"Scotchman's Cave,\" which lies under\r\nO'Leary's. It is a small but very beautiful chamber, giving one the\r\nidea that it has been hollowed out in a mountain of Parian marble. Now\r\nwe struck into the long series running east through \"O'Callaghan's\r\nCave\" to the farthest point yet reached. This was one of the principal\r\nchannels by which the ancient waters descended, from openings now\r\nunknown and inaccessible, to the labyrinth of forsaken waterways we\r\nhad left behind. Our guide, who astonished us by the rapidity with\r\nwhich he got over difficult ground, was unable to make very speedy\r\nprogress here. The ramifications are extremely hard to unravel, and he\r\nhad only been in this part twice before, in 1895 with M. Martel, and\r\ntwenty-five years earlier, as a boy, with his father. Eventually, after\r\nmany wanderings, we reached \"Brogden's Cave,\" where hitherto all direct\r\nprogress had stopped. On the south side (not on the north, as shown\r\nin the chart) is the \"Chapel,\" which M. Martel rightly described as\r\nthe most beautiful thing in the whole cavern. It is an arched recess,\r\ncanopied with stalagmite of the purest and most delicate lustre.\r\n\r\nWhilst my companion rested, I joined the guide, who was hunting for the\r\npassage to a cave where his father had taken him thirty-five years ago.\r\nWe discovered the opening at last, and after wriggling and squirming\r\nround innumerable twists and corners, we dropped over a low cliff,\r\nbeyond which a short wriggle brought us into a long and lofty cave,\r\nmagnificently walled and pillared with snowy calcite. Floor, walls,\r\nand roof were a spotless white, wrought into intricate reliefs and\r\nembroideries by the flow of the freakish stalagmite. The guide stated\r\nthat this was \"Cust's Cave,\" and the one beyond, where our progress\r\nstopped, he called the \"Demon's Cave.\" M. Martel's chart shows a\r\n\"Cust's Cave\" of a totally different shape and size, near the \"River\";\r\nand, as there is no mention extant of any cave beyond Brogden's, I take\r\nit that this, the real Cust's, was unknown to him. Unfortunately I had\r\nfollowed the guide without bringing the plan or a compass, unaware\r\nthat we were going so far from the known parts of the cavern; and\r\nnow, to my disgust, the guide was unable to find the way out. Twice\r\nhe descended into a hole at our end of the cave, and emerged with the\r\nintelligence, \"It's not there, sir.\" We ransacked every opening in\r\nwall and floor, but failed to hit on any exit whatever. The guide grew\r\nalarmed, and rushed off to the farther end of the cave, wondering if\r\nwe had completely lost our sense of direction. He tried whistling; but\r\nthe hundreds of feet of rock between us and our companion were well\r\nable to guard their ancient silence. Tired with these exertions, he\r\nnext proposed that we should put out the lights and rest for a while.\r\nWhether his idea was to husband the only provisions we had, I could not\r\nsay; but at any rate the situation did look serious, since rescuers\r\nmight have taken days to discover our position in this remote corridor,\r\nof whose very existence, probably, our guide was the only man in\r\nIreland that knew anything. But where there is a way in, there is a way\r\nout, as I very well knew from several similar experiences; and after a\r\npretty bad half-hour, we did manage to recover the trail, and got back\r\nto our friend, who had been completely mystified by our disappearance,\r\nand was almost as relieved as we by our return. After many hours of\r\nfatiguing work, we were glad to follow our guide back through the\r\nlabyrinthine passages, by the most direct route to the open air.\r\n\r\nOur chief regret was that we had relied too much on the completeness of\r\nprevious surveys, and had not taken materials for correcting the map.\r\nWe had secured many photographs of the earlier chambers, but had not\r\ntaken the camera into the innermost cavities, where photography would\r\nbe most profitable. M. Martel's dictum can still be endorsed that there\r\nis a great field for research in the Mitchelstown Cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abergele, 123.\r\n\r\n  _Abîmes, Les_, 34,
