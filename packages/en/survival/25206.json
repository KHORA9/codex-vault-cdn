The benefit which the author intends that the reader shall\r\nderive from them, is an influence on the cast of his intellectual\r\ncharacter, which is receiving its permanent form during the years to\r\nwhich these writings are adapted.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of knowledge, however, though in this case a secondary,\r\nis by no means an unimportant object; and the discussion of the several\r\ntopics proceeds accordingly, with regularity, upon a certain system of\r\nclassification. This classification is based upon the more obvious\r\nexternal properties and relations of matter, and less upon those which,\r\nthough they are more extensive and general in their nature, and,\r\ntherefore, more suitable, in a strictly-scientific point of view, for\r\nthe foundations of a system, are less apparent, and require higher\r\npowers of generalization and abstraction; and are, therefore, less in\r\naccordance with the genius and spirit of the _Rollo_ philosophy.\r\n\r\nAs teachers have, in some cases, done the author the honor to introduce\r\nsome of the preceding works of this class into their schools, as reading\r\nbooks, &c., considerable reference has been had to this, in the form and\r\nmanner of the discussion, and questions have been added to facilitate\r\nthe use of the books in cases where parents or teachers may make the\r\nreading of them a regular exercise of instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I.

It was near the end of March, and the snow had become so\r\nconsolidated by the warm sun in the days, and the hard frosts at night,\r\nthat it would bear the children to walk upon it. The children called it\r\nthe crust; but it was not, strictly speaking, a crust, for the snow was\r\ncompact and solid, not merely upon the top, but nearly throughout the\r\nwhole mass, down to the ground.\r\n\r\nRollo and Lucy were going to have an expedition upon the crust. Rollo\r\nhad a sled, and they were going to put upon the sled such things as they\r\nshould need, and Rollo was to draw it, while Lucy and Nathan, Rollo's\r\nlittle brother, were to walk along by his side.\r\n\r\nRollo's sled was ready at the back door, when Lucy came. Lucy brought\r\nwith her some provisions for a luncheon, in a basket. This was her part\r\nof the preparation. Rollo got his axe, and one or two boards a little\r\nlonger than the sled, which he said were to make seats. He also had a\r\ntinder-box, and some matches, to enable him to make a fire. When all\r\nthings were ready, the three children set out together.\r\n\r\nRollo drew the sled, with the boards, the basket, and some other things\r\nupon it, all bound together securely with a cord. The load appeared to\r\nbe considerable in bulk, but it was not heavy, and Rollo drew it along\r\nvery easily. They were not obliged to confine themselves to the roads\r\nand paths, for the snow was hard in every direction, and they could go\r\nover the fields wherever they pleased. In one place, where the snow was\r\nvery deep on the side of a hill, they went right over the top of a stone\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy day, but calm. This was favorable. The sky being\r\novercast, kept the sun from thawing the snow; but yet their father told\r\nthem that probably it would begin to grow soft before they came home,\r\nand, if so, they would have to come home in a certain sled road, which\r\nJonas had made that winter by hauling wood. He advised them not to\r\nencamp at any great distance from the sled road.\r\n\r\nThey came at last to a pleasant spot on the margin of a wood, near where\r\nthere was a spring. The rocks around the spring were all covered with\r\nsnow, and the little stream, which in summer flowed from the spring, was\r\nfrozen and buried up entirely out of sight. But the spring itself was\r\nopen, which Rollo said was very fortunate, as they might want some water\r\nto drink.\r\n\r\nHere they encamped. Rollo cut some stakes, which he drove down into the\r\nsnow, and contrived to make a rude sort of table with his boards. He\r\nalso cut a large number of hemlock branches, which Lucy and Nathan\r\ndragged out and spread around the table for them to sit upon. Then\r\nRollo built a fire of sticks, which he gathered in the wood. The ground\r\nwas covered with snow, so that it would have been very difficult for him\r\nto have found any sticks, were it not that some kinds of trees, in the\r\nwoods, have a great many small branches near the bottom, which are dead\r\nand dry. These Rollo cut off, and Lucy and Nathan dragged them out, and\r\nput them on the fire when he had kindled it. The fire was a little way\r\nfrom the table, with the carpet of hemlock boughs between.\r\n\r\nThere was a high hill covered with snow at a little distance, and, after\r\nthey had eaten their luncheon, Rollo said,--\r\n\r\n\"O Lucy, we will play go up the mountains. There is a hill for us. That\r\nshall be Chimborazo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lucy, \"if you will cut us some long staves.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Rollo went into the wood, and selected some tall and slender\r\nyoung trees, about an inch in diameter, and cut two for Lucy, two for\r\nNathan, and two for himself. These he trimmed up smoothly, and each of\r\nthe children took one in each hand. They played that Rollo was the\r\nguide, and Lucy was the philosopher. Nathan was the philosopher's\r\nservant. Rollo conducted them safely to the summit; but just after they\r\ngot there, it began to snow.\r\n\r\nThe snow descended in large flakes, and Rollo was delighted to see it;\r\nbut Lucy seemed a little anxious. She said that, if there should be much\r\nsnow, it would make it hard for Nathan to get home, and she thought that\r\nthey had better go down the mountain immediately, and set out for home.\r\nRollo was rather unwilling to go, but he allowed himself to be\r\npersuaded, and so they all came down the mountain together.\r\n\r\nThey packed up their things as quick as they could, leaving the\r\nfire to burn itself out, only Rollo first piled on all the hemlock\r\nbranches,--which made a great crackling. The snow began to fall faster.\r\nThe air was full of the large flakes, which floated slowly down, and\r\nlodged gently upon the old snow.\r\n\r\nThe children went along very successfully for some time, but at length\r\nRollo lost his way. The air was so full of snow-flakes, that he could\r\nsee only a very little way before him; and the old snow covered the\r\nground, so as to hide all the old marks, and to alter the general\r\naspect of the fields so much, that Rollo was completely lost. He,\r\nhowever, did not say anything about it, but wandered on, Lucy and Nathan\r\nwondering all the while why they did not get home; until at length they\r\ncame across a track in the snow.\r\n\r\n\"O! see this track,\" said Rollo. \"Here is a track, where somebody else\r\nhas been along with a sled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lucy, \"some boys, who have gone out to slide, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe track was partly obliterated by the snow which had fallen upon it\r\nsince the boys that made it had gone along. Rollo wondered whose track\r\nit could be. He said that he thought it very probable it was Henry's.\r\nLucy thought that it might be the track of some children, that had gone\r\nout to find them.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Rollo, \"we will follow the track a little way, and\r\nsee what it leads to. Perhaps we shall overtake the boys.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Rollo turned along in the track, but Lucy stopped.\r\n\r\n\"No, Rollo,\" said she, \"we must go the other way if we want to find the\r\nboys;--the track is going the other way. But never mind,\" she added, \"I\r\ndon't want to find the boys; I want to go home; so we will go this way.\"\r\n\r\nRollo went on, secretly pleased to find the track, for he supposed that\r\nby retracing it, as he was doing, it would lead him back home. He had,\r\nhowever, a great curiosity to know who could have made it; and in fact\r\nthe mystery was soon unraveled.\r\n\r\nFor, after following the track a short distance, they saw before them a\r\nlarge, dark spot upon the snow, and, on drawing near to it, to see what\r\nit was, they found it was the place of their own encampment; and the\r\ntrack which they were following was their own track, leading them back\r\nto the mouldering remains of their own fire. They had gone round in a\r\ngreat circle, and come back upon their own course. Rollo looked\r\nexceedingly blank and confused at this unexpected termination of the\r\nclew, which he had hoped was to have led him out of his difficulty. What\r\nhe was to do now, he did not know.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, that they were lost, was no longer to be concealed;\r\nand Lucy proposed that they should go into the woods, where the tops of\r\nthe trees would act as a sort of umbrella, to keep the snow from falling\r\nupon them, and wait there until it stopped snowing; and then the air\r\nwould be clear, and they could find their way out.\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said Rollo, \"I can easily make a hut of hemlock branches, and we\r\ncan go into that for shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Rollo,\" said Nathan, \"how do you know but that it will snow all\r\nday? We can't stay in the woods all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo; \"when it snows in great flakes, it is not going to\r\nsnow long. Jonas told me so.\"\r\n\r\nSo the children went into the woods, and Rollo began to make his hut;\r\nbut he was soon interrupted, and the attention of all the children was\r\ncalled off by a little bird, which they saw there, hopping about, and\r\nappearing benumbed with cold. After some effort, Rollo succeeded in\r\ncatching her in his cap.\r\n\r\n\"We'll carry her home,\" said Nathan; \"we'll carry her home, and show her\r\nto mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I'll carry her in my cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lucy, \"you must have your cap on your head, or you will take\r\ncold. Let me carry her in my hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo, \"you will have to lead Nathan. I'll tell you what we\r\nwill do. We will put her into the basket, for a cage.\"\r\n\r\nLucy, on the whole, liked this plan, and they accordingly put the bird\r\nin the basket, and Rollo contrived to make a cover of boughs, to keep\r\nher from getting away.\r\n\r\nBy the time that this was all arranged, the children found, to their\r\ngreat satisfaction, that it had ceased snowing; and they immediately set\r\nout for home. Rollo drew the sled, with the basket and bird upon it,\r\nsecured as before with the cord; and Lucy led Nathan. They now had no\r\ndifficulty in finding their way, and soon reached home in safety.\r\n\r\nThey kept the bird until the next day, and then, as it was mild and\r\npleasant, they let her fly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    By what process had the snow become hardened at this time? Did\r\n    Rollo's father expect that it would continue hard till noon?\r\n    Why not? Did it continue hard? What prevented its melting? How\r\n    did Rollo get sticks for his fire? What name did he give to the\r\n    hill which they ascended? What occasioned the difficulty in the\r\n    way of Rollo's finding his way home? What conversation took\r\n    place when he found the track? Was this track in the new snow,\r\n    or in the old snow? How had it become partly obliterated? How\r\n    did they carry the bird home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFLYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNathan became very much interested in the bird, and that evening, as his\r\nfather was sitting by the fire, with a book in his hand, which he had\r\nbeen reading, Nathan came up to him, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Father, are you busy now,--thinking, or anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Nathan, \"if you are not, I want to read you something\r\nout of my little book.\"\r\n\r\nSo Nathan's father took him up into his lap, and Nathan opened his\r\nlittle book, and began to read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"'With fins for the water, and wings for the air,\r\n    And feet for the ground, I could go everywhere.'\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that funny?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Rather funny,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had wings,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then I could fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not certain,\" said his father. \"There are two difficulties\r\nwhich prevent boys from flying. One is, they have no wings; and the\r\nother is, they have not strength to use them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O father,\" said Nathan, \"I could use them; I am pretty strong. I can\r\nwheel Rollo's wheelbarrow.\"\r\n\r\nHis father smiled. \"Very possibly,\" said he; \"but I do not think that\r\nyou would be strong enough to use wings, even if you had them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, at any rate, I am stronger than a bird,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"you have more actual strength than a bird, but\r\nnot more in proportion to your size. You are absolutely stronger, but\r\nnot relatively.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you have actually more strength than a bird,--a robin, for\r\ninstance; you could hold him so that he could not get away; and you\r\ncould lift more than he could too. But then you are a great deal\r\nlarger, and you are not as much stronger than he is, as you are larger.\r\nIf you are a hundred times as heavy as he, you are not a hundred times\r\nas strong. That's what I mean by saying that you are absolutely\r\nstronger, but not relatively. That is, you are not as many times\r\nstronger, as you are larger and heavier. You are absolutely stronger,\r\nbut not relatively; that is, in proportion to your size and weight.\r\n\r\n\"Now I can prove to you,\" continued his father, \"that you would not be\r\nstrong enough to fly with wings, even if you had them. Suppose there was\r\na pole fastened across the room, and another pole just above it; could\r\nyou pull yourself up, from one pole to the other, by your hands alone,\r\nwithout touching your feet?--Or a ladder,\" continued his father,--\"it\r\nwill be better to suppose a ladder. Now, if there was a ladder leaning\r\nup against a building, could you climb up on the under side by your\r\nhands, drawing yourself up, hand over hand, without touching your feet?\"\r\n\r\nHere Rollo, who was reading in a little chair at the back part of the\r\nroom, when his father first commenced the conversation with Nathan, but\r\nwho had been listening for a few minutes past to what his father had\r\nbeen saying, jumped up, and came across the room to his father, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, yes, sir; I can. I have done it often in the barn.\"\r\n\r\n\"How high up could you go?\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"O, almost up to the loft,\" said Rollo. \"Only, you see, father, the\r\nrounds are too far up. I can't reach up very well. If they were nearer\r\ntogether, I could climb up so, very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said his father, \"a bird, when flying, has to climb up in much\r\nthe same way. He has to pull himself up by the _air_, with his wings,\r\njust as you do with your hands and arms, by the rounds of the ladder;\r\nonly the air is not fixed, like the ladder, but constantly gives way\r\nunder his wing; and so, to make the case the same, you must suppose that\r\nthe ladder is not firm, but is floating in the air, and sinks down with\r\nyour weight, so that you have to climb up faster than you pull the\r\nladder down. Do you think you would have strength enough in your arms to\r\ndo that?\"\r\n\r\nRollo and Nathan looked very much interested in what their father was\r\nsaying, but they both admitted that they could not climb up such ladders\r\nas those.\r\n\r\n\"The air,\" added their father, \"gives way continually under the bird's\r\nwing; and yet they have to pull themselves up by it. And this is very\r\nhard. They must either have very large wings, and prodigious strength to\r\nuse them, so as to pull upon the air with very hard and heavy strokes,\r\nor else, if they have small wings, they must have strength to strike\r\nvery quick and often with them.\r\n\r\n\"The wings of sparrows move so quick, that you cannot count the strokes;\r\nand those of humming-birds, which are smaller still, so fast that you\r\ncannot see them. They make a hum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could make my wings go so fast,\" said Nathan; and he began to imitate\r\nthe flapping of the wings of a bird, with his arms, as rapidly and\r\nforcibly as he could.\r\n\r\n\"So can I,\" said Rollo; and he made the same motions. \"That is as fast\r\nas crows' wings move, when they are flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"crows move their _wings_ as fast as that,\r\nwhereas you only move hands and arms. If you had great wings, as long,\r\nin proportion, as the crows, you could not move them so fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"How large would they be?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"O, I don't know,--perhaps as big as the top of the dining-table.\"\r\n\r\n\"O father,\" said Rollo, \"I don't think they would be as big as that. The\r\ncrow's wings are not longer than his body, and so mine would not be\r\nlonger than my body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you never saw a crow's body,\" said his father. \"His feathers\r\nand his tail, which are very light, swell out his body, and make it\r\nappear much larger than it really is. I presume his wings, when they are\r\nspread, are twice or three times as long as his body. If you had wings\r\nin proportion, it would be with the utmost difficulty that you could use\r\nthem at all. You certainly could not strike the air with them fast\r\nenough to pull yourself up by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not think that the birds pulled themselves up by the air,\" said\r\nNathan. \"I did not know that the air was anything _real_.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes; it is something real,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen birds fly without moving their wings at all,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"and so have I seen a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"A stone!\" repeated Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"What, a stone fly?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father; \"did you never see a stone fly through the\r\nair, without any wings at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Rollo, \"when somebody threw it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said his father. \"If you set the stone in motion, it will\r\ncontinue in motion for some time, without any wings; and so will a\r\nbird.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, they don't throw birds,\" said Nathan; and he laughed aloud\r\nat such an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Birds throw themselves,\" said his father; \"that is, they strike their\r\nwings upon the air, hard and quick, and thus get into very quick motion,\r\nand then they can keep their wings still for a time, and go on, as long\r\nas the impulse they have given them lasts. This shows what prodigious\r\nstrength they have in their wings. They can not only strike the air hard\r\nand frequently enough to raise themselves up, and move along, but they\r\ncan do it so easily, as to get such a velocity, that they can rest their\r\nwings for some time, and sail away through the air, only expending the\r\nimpulse they had accumulated.\"\r\n\r\nRollo and Nathan were silent. Rollo was thinking how he had seen the\r\nswallows sailing swiftly round and round in the air, with their wings\r\nspread out motionless by their side.\r\n\r\n\"So, you see,\" continued his father, \"the difficulty in the way of a\r\nboy's flying, is not the want of wings, but the want of strength to use\r\nthem. It would be very easy to make wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father. \"At least it would not be very difficult.\r\nIngenious mechanics would soon find out modes of making something to\r\nanswer the purpose of wings, to strike upon the air, if there was the\r\nnecessary power to work them. The great difficulty in almost all cases\r\nin mechanics is, in getting the power; there is very little difficulty\r\nin applying it to any purpose it is wanted for. So, you see, next time,\r\nNathan, when you want to fly, you must wish, not that you had wings, but\r\nthat you were strong enough to use them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father,\" said Rollo, \"men are strong enough to paddle themselves\r\nalong in the water; why can't they in the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said his father, \"water supports them by its buoyancy, and\r\nthey have nothing to do but to move themselves along upon it. But air\r\ncannot support them; and, of course, a great part of the effort which\r\nthey would make, would be required to keep them up. And then, besides,\r\nthe water is generally nearly at rest, but the air is generally in a\r\nstate of rapid motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father,\" said Rollo, \"I'm sure water is sometimes in rapid motion.\r\nThe rivers run very swiftly, often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father; \"but then, when they do, men cannot paddle,\r\nor row boats upon them. A current that should run at the rate of four or\r\nfive miles an hour, would be very hard to row against. But the air is\r\nseldom in a state of less motion than that. It is very often moving at\r\nthe rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour; sometimes sixty. So, you\r\nsee, there is a double reason why men cannot fly in the air, as well as\r\npaddle on the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were only light enough,\" said Rollo, \"to float in the air, then\r\nwe could fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could paddle about in it, when it was calm,\" replied his father,\r\n\"but that would not be flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything light enough to float in the air?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, \"I don't think of any visible substance that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by visible substance?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, anything that you can see,\" replied his father. \"There are some\r\nother kinds of air, which are lighter than common air, but there is\r\nnothing else, so far as I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father, there are clouds. They float, and they are visible, I am\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father. \"There is some mystery about the floating of\r\nclouds. I don't fully understand it. Clouds are formed of small\r\nglobules or little balls of water; and water, I should think, whatever\r\nthe size of the little drops might be, would be heavier than air. And\r\nyet they seem to float. If they are large, like rain drops, they fall\r\nquickly to the ground. If they are small, like mist, they fall slowly.\r\nThat I should expect. If they are finer still, like vapor or fog, I\r\nshould think that they would fall still more slowly; but still I should\r\nsuppose that they would descend. But they do not appear to descend; they\r\nseem to float, nearly at rest; though perhaps all the clouds we see, may\r\nbe slowly descending all the time, while we do not perceive it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The smoke goes up from the top of the chimney,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"there is no difficulty about that. The vapor\r\nfrom a fire is carried up by the warm air, no doubt. Air swells when it\r\nis heated, and so becomes lighter, and rises; and the hot air from the\r\ntop of the chimney carries the vapor up with it, no doubt. After it\r\nrises a little way, and becomes cool, it ceases to ascend, but floats\r\naway horizontally. Perhaps it begins to descend when it gets cool,\r\nthough very slowly; and perhaps all clouds are really descending all\r\nthe time, though too slowly for us to perceive the motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only,\" said Rollo, \"after a little time, they would get down to the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" said his father; \"for, when they get down nearer the\r\nearth, where it is warm, they may be gradually dissolved, and disappear,\r\nand thus never reach the earth. I should think they would descend, being\r\ncomposed of globules of water, which, however small, must, I should\r\nthink, be heavier than air.\"\r\n\r\n\"A soap bubble will float in the air,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw one that would,\" said his father, \"unless it got into a\r\ncurrent, which carried it up. A soap bubble--make it ever so thin--shows\r\na tendency to descend, unless you put it out in the open air, where\r\nthere are currents to carry it up. It descends very slowly, but still it\r\ndescends. It is heavier than the air. I am not absolutely certain, but I\r\nbelieve there is no visible substance that is lighter than the air; and\r\nit is very well for us there is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if there were any, they would immediately rise from the earth,\r\nand float upwards, till they got up where the air was so light and thin,\r\nthat they could not go up any higher.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" said Rollo, \"we should lose them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would not be all,\" said his father. \"They would float about, above\r\nus, and, if there were enough of them, they would form a perpetual cloud\r\nover our heads, to keep out the sun, and to make the world dark and\r\ngloomy. There seems to have been no way to keep all the solid and\r\nvisible substances of the earth down upon its surface, but to make them\r\nall heavier than the air.\r\n\r\n\"And thus,\" continued his father, \"all solid substances being heavier\r\nthan the air, they sink in it, like stones or iron in water. Only those\r\nthat are very much expanded in surface, sink very slowly, and sometimes\r\nalmost seem to float.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by _expanded_, father?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Spread out,\" said his father. \"An umbrella, for example, when it is\r\nspread out, is said to be expanded; other things are expanded in a\r\nlittle different way. A feather is expanded, that is, it is spread out\r\nin fine filaments, which extend, in every direction, into the air, all\r\naround the stem of it. Things that are expanded take a great deal of air\r\nwith them when they descend, and so can only descend slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And water is expanded in a soap bubble,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"and there is a great deal of air included in\r\nit, which all has to be brought down when the bubble itself descends.\r\nAnd thus, you see, the bubble must descend slowly. Water is expanded,\r\ntoo, in clouds; for, in that case, it is divided into millions of small\r\nparticles, by which it is spread out over a great deal of air, and\r\ncannot descend without bringing a large portion of the air with it. Men\r\nhave contrived, on this principle, to make an apparatus to prevent being\r\nhurt by falling from great heights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is called a parachute. It is a sort of umbrella; in fact, it is\r\nan umbrella, only made very large. It is folded up, and fastened under a\r\nballoon, just over the car, which the man is in. Then, if the balloon\r\nbursts, or any other accident happens to it, and the man begins to fall,\r\nthe parachute opens and spreads, and then the man falls very slowly. The\r\nreason is, that the parachute takes hold of a large mass of air, and\r\nbrings it down with it; and so it cannot descend very fast.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days after this, Nathan said to Rollo, as they were playing in the\r\nyard, that he wished that he had a parachute.\r\n\r\n\"I know where there is one,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"A parachute,\" said Nathan; \"a real parachute?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"or, what is the same thing, a great umbrella.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that just the same?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"for father said that a parachute was in fact only a\r\nlarge umbrella; and father has got a large umbrella in the closet, and I\r\nhave a great mind to go and get it for a parachute.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you haven't got any balloon,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O, no matter for that,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Then how are you going to get up into the air?\" asked Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can climb up on the shed, and jump off that, and hold the\r\numbrella over my head.\"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, Rollo's cousin James came into the yard, and Rollo\r\nran to him, to explain to him about the parachute. After describing to\r\nhim the construction of it, and its use by men who go up in balloons, he\r\nsaid he was going to get his father's umbrella, which would make an\r\nexcellent parachute.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" continued he, \"I am going to get upon some high place, and\r\njump off, and hold the parachute over my head, and then I shall come\r\ndown as light as a feather.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Rollo,\" said James, \"I don't believe you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes I shall,\" said Rollo: \"you see the parachute is expanded, and so\r\nbrings down a great deal of air with it, and this makes it come very\r\nslowly. Air is a _real thing_, James, and it keeps the parachute back a\r\ngreat deal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"James and Nathan both ran towards him, thinking that he\r\nmust be hurt.\"--Page 37.]\r\n\r\nSo Rollo ran off after the umbrella, very much interested in proving to\r\nJames, by actual experiment, that the air was a real thing. When he came\r\nwith it, he was himself inclined to make the first experiment from the\r\nlow side of the shed. He could climb up, by means of a fence at the\r\ncorner. James advised him, however, to try it first from the end of a\r\nwoodpile, which was pretty high, but yet not so high as the shed. James\r\nwas not quite sure that the experiment would succeed, and he was afraid\r\nthat Rollo might get hurt.\r\n\r\nRollo said that he was not afraid to jump off the shed. He knew the\r\nparachute would bear him up. He did not believe but that he could jump\r\noff the house with it; and, at any rate, he could jump off the shed, he\r\nknew. He accordingly clambered up, and, taking his station upon the\r\neaves, he spread the umbrella over his head, and then jumped off.\r\n\r\nDown he came with great violence; his cap flew off in one direction, and\r\nhis umbrella rolled away in another, as he had to put out both his\r\nhands, to save himself, when he reached the ground. As it was, he came\r\ndown upon all fours, and in such a way, that James and Nathan both ran\r\ntowards him, thinking that he must be hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hurt yourself, Rollo?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo, \"not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the umbrella did you much good.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo, as he got up rubbing his elbows, \"it didn't, and I\r\ndon't see what the reason is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came down just as hard as you would without it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nathan, \"and he almost broke his back; I don't believe the\r\nair is any real thing at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that the umbrella did do _some_ good. Rollo did not come\r\ndown quite so hard as he would have done without it. It retarded his\r\ndescent a little. But it was not large enough to enable him to descend\r\nin safety. When his father said that a parachute was in fact only a\r\nlarge umbrella, he meant a great deal larger than Rollo had supposed. A\r\nparachute, such as is used with balloons, is a great deal larger than\r\nany umbrella that ever was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What was Nathan's wish, after he had read his father something\r\n    out of his book? Did he think that he could fly if he had\r\n    wings? Did his father think so? What deficiency did his father\r\n    think was even more important than that of wings? Did Nathan\r\n    think that a boy was stronger than a bird? Is a boy _absolutely_\r\n    stronger than a bird? Is he _relatively_ stronger? What is the\r\n    meaning of _relatively_ stronger? Would a man be strong enough\r\n    to work wings that were sufficiently large to bear him up into\r\n    the air? Would there be any great difficulty in constructing\r\n    wings for him if he were strong enough?\r\n\r\n    Is any visible substance lighter than air? What would be the\r\n    consequence if any of the loose substances about the earth's\r\n    surface were light enough? What are clouds composed of? What\r\n    difficulty did Rollo's father point out, in regard to their\r\n    floating in the air? What is a _parachute_? Describe Rollo's\r\n    experiment with the umbrella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVALVE MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, when Rollo awaked, he heard a sharp clicking against the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Nathan,\" said he, \"Nathan, I believe there is a snow-storm.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nathan was too sleepy to hear or understand.\r\n\r\nRollo looked up, but there was a curtain against the window, and he\r\ncould not see very well. He listened. He heard a low, moaning sound made\r\nby the wind, and a continuance of the sharp clicking which he had heard\r\nat first.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got up, and dressed himself, he found that there was a\r\nviolent snow-storm. At first he was glad of it, for he liked\r\nsnow-storms. But then, pretty soon, he was sorry, for it had been winter\r\na long time, and he was impatient for the spring.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, he and Nathan read and studied for two hours, under\r\ntheir mother's direction. When they were released from these duties,\r\nRollo proposed to Nathan that they should go out into the shed, and see\r\nhow the storm came on. There was a large door in the shed, opening\r\ntowards the street, where they could stand, protected from the wind, and\r\nsee the drifts of snow.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly put on their caps, and went. They found that the snow\r\nwas pretty deep. It was heaped up upon the fence and against the\r\nwindows; and there was a curious-shaped drift, with the top curled over\r\nin a singular manner, running along from the corner of the shed towards\r\nthe garden gate.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" says Rollo, \"when it clears up, I mean to go and wade through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I too,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O Nathan,\" said Rollo, \"it is over your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said Nathan; \"who is that pounding in the barn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Jonas, I suppose,\" said Rollo. \"I mean to go out and see what he\r\nis doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to get there?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O, I can put on my boots,\" said Rollo, \"and go right out through the\r\nsnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish _I_ could go,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I can carry you on my back.\"\r\n\r\nNathan clapped his hands at this proposal, being doubly pleased at the\r\nprospect of both getting into the barn to see what Jonas was doing, and\r\nalso of having a ride, on the way.\r\n\r\nSo Rollo put on his boots, while Nathan went and got Rollo his straps,\r\nto fasten his pantaloons around them. When all was ready, Rollo sat down\r\nupon the step of the door, in order that Nathan might get on easily.\r\n\r\n\"We'll play that I am a camel,\" said Rollo, \"and that I'm kneeling down\r\nfor you to get on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do camels kneel down,\" said Nathan, \"when the men want to ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo; and so saying, he rose laboriously, with his heavy\r\nburden upon his shoulders. He staggered along with some difficulty, but\r\nyet safely, until he came to the great drift; and, after wallowing into\r\nthe midst of it, he lost his balance, and both camel and driver rolled\r\nover together into the snow. The snow got up under Nathan's sleeve, and\r\nhe began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"O Nathan,\" said Rollo, \"don't cry. I'll run and get Jonas to come and\r\ncarry you in.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo ran into the barn, and called to Jonas to come quick. Jonas\r\nlaid down his hammer upon the bench, and followed Rollo. He found Nathan\r\nin the snow, and took him up in his arms, and carried him into the barn.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got him under cover, he brushed the snow off, and told him\r\nnot to cry. \"I've got a fire in the shop,\" said he, \"and you shall see\r\nme do my work. I'm mending the bellows.\"\r\n\r\nSo he led Nathan through the barn, and thence along under a shed to a\r\nsort of shop-room, where there was a large fireplace and a fire. Rollo\r\nput on some sticks, which made a great blaze; and so Nathan soon got\r\nwarm and dry, and forgot all his troubles. Then Jonas sat him up, upon a\r\nhigh stool, near the bench, where he could see him work. He was just\r\ndrawing out some of the nails, by which the leather of the bellows was\r\nnailed to the sides.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with the bellows?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"The valve is out of order,\" replied Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"The valve,\" repeated Nathan; \"what is the valve?\"\r\n\r\n\"The valve is a kind of clapper,\" said Jonas. \"I will show it to you in\r\na few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jonas proceeded to take off the leather from one of the sides of the\r\nbellows. There was a hole in one of the sides, but no hole in the other.\r\nNathan had often noticed the hole, but he did not know what it was for.\r\n\r\n\"What is the hole for?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"That is to let the air in,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"What do they want the air to come in for?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"To make wind of,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Do they make wind out of air?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"they get the bellows full of air, and then blow it\r\nout through the nose, and that makes wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wind is air, put in motion,\" said Rollo. \"I read it in a book.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, Jonas had taken off the leather so far that Nathan could\r\nsee into the bellows. He saw that there was a little clapper over the\r\nhole, in one of the sides of the bellows.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the valve?\" said he to Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"What is it for?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"It is to keep the wind from coming out of that hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they want the wind to go out of that hole?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"they want it to go to the fire,--to blow the\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Rollo, \"it can't go out of the hole, and so it has to go\r\nout of the long nose, which is pointed towards the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes it go out at all?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, when we blow the bellows, we press the two sides together, and\r\nthat presses the wind out. It can't go out of the hole whence it came\r\nin, because the clapper stops it up, and so it goes out the long nose,\r\nright into the fire, and makes the fire burn.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, Jonas had got the leather off so far, that he could get at\r\nthe clapper to mend it. He told the boys that it was old and worn out,\r\nand he must make a new one.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to make it?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" said Jonas, \"if you watch me closely.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jonas took some leather, and cut out a piece, of an oblong shape, a\r\nlittle wider than the hole, and about twice as long. Then he laid this\r\ndown over the hole. It covered it entirely. Then he took some small\r\ncarpet nails, and nailed one of the ends of the leather down to the\r\nboard. Then Jonas put his hand down under the board, and run one of his\r\nfingers up through the hole, and pushed the leather up a little way.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said he to the boys, \"you see I have nailed the leather, so\r\nthat, when it lies down in its place, it covers the hole completely; and\r\nyet I can push it up a little with my fingers, so that there will be an\r\nopening.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jonas cut a small leather strap, and nailed one end of it down upon\r\none side of the clapper, and the other end upon the other side of the\r\nclapper. He put one little carpet nail into each end of the strap. The\r\nstrap, when it was nailed, passed directly across the clapper or valve.\r\nIt was not drawn tight across, but it lay upon the clapper loosely. The\r\nends were nailed tight, but the middle rested loosely upon the clapper.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jonas, \"I can push the clapper up a little way, but I can't\r\npush it far. The strap keeps it from coming up far.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" said Nathan, \"do you want it to go up at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"To let the air in,\" said Jonas. \"When I get the leather all nailed on\r\nagain, I'll show you the whole operation of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can be telling us about it in the mean time,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Jonas, \"when I lift up the upper side of the bellows\r\nby the handle, to blow, the air comes in by the hole. The clapper lifts\r\nup a little way, and lets it in. Then, when I press down the handle\r\nagain, it presses the air out through the nose, because it can't go back\r\nthrough the valve hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"the valve falls down over the hole, and stops it\r\nup. It is made so as to lift up easily, and then to fall down and cover\r\nthe hole exactly, and prevent the air going out the same way it came in.\r\nSo, as it cannot get out by the valve, it has all to go out through the\r\nnose. If the nose were stopped up, it could not get out at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" replied Jonas, \"you could not bring the two sides of the\r\nbellows together again. The air between would keep them apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to try,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jonas; \"and there are some other experiments you may\r\nperform with it too.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, Jonas said that he had got the leather all nailed on, and\r\nthey might try the experiment. He took hold of the nose of the bellows,\r\nand held his thumb near the end of it, ready to stop up the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nathan, you may take hold of the handles, and pull them apart as\r\nif you were going to blow.\"\r\n\r\nNathan did so. He pulled the handles apart, and held them open.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jonas, \"I will stop up the nose, and the valve will close\r\nitself; and then you will find that you cannot bring the sides together\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jonas put his thumb over the hole, and told Nathan to blow.\r\n\r\nNathan pressed hard, and the sides came together again, about as easily\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Jonas with surprise. He did not know what to make of\r\nthe failure of his experiment.\r\n\r\n\"There must be a leak somewhere,\" said he. And he took the bellows out\r\nof Nathan's hand to look for it.\r\n\r\nHe found there was a corner, on the side opposite to the one where he\r\nhad been working, where the leather was open, he having forgotten to\r\nnail it down.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"here is the difficulty. When I have nailed this down, we\r\nwill try again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a leak?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas. \"When you worked the bellows, you pressed the air all\r\nout through there. I did not know that that was open. Let me nail this\r\ndown, and then we will begin our experiment regularly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What was Jonas doing in the shop, when Rollo and Nathan went out\r\n    to find him? What part of the bellows was out of order? How did\r\n    he make a new valve? How did he fasten it to its place? Did he\r\n    nail down only one edge, or both edges? Why did he want the\r\n    other edge to be left at liberty? How did he prevent its lifting\r\n    up too far? What was the first experiment which he performed\r\n    with the bellows, after he had finished the mending? Did it\r\n    succeed at first? Why not? In working a pair of bellows, where\r\n    does the air come in? Where does it go out? Why cannot the air\r\n    escape through the valve where it comes in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jonas had finished nailing down the corner, he said, \"Now there are\r\nseveral experiments, which we can perform with the bellows. I will be\r\nthe professor, and you two shall be my class in philosophy, and I will\r\ndirect you how to make the experiments.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said Jonas, \"you, Rollo, may take hold of the nose of the\r\nbellows with your hand, in such a way as to put your thumb over the end\r\nof it, to stop it up, and then let Nathan try to blow.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so, and Nathan tried to blow. He found that he could open the\r\nbellows very easily; but when he attempted to press the sides together\r\nagain, he could not. He crowded the handle belonging to the upper side\r\ndown, as hard as he could, but it would not move.\r\n\r\n\"What makes it do so?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"The air inside,\" said Jonas. \"We have stopped up all the places, where\r\nit could get out. The valve stops itself. Rollo stops the nose with his\r\nthumb, and I have nailed the leather down close, about all the sides.\r\nAnd so the air can't get out, and that keeps you from bringing the sides\r\ntogether again.\"\r\n\r\nNathan tried again with all his strength. The sides came together very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas. \"They come a little, just as fast as the air can leak\r\nout through the little leaks all around.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you stopped all the leaks,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas, \"I stopped all the real leaks, but still I can't\r\nmake it perfectly tight. Some air can escape between the leather and the\r\nnails all around, and just as fast as it can get out, so fast you can\r\npress the sides together, and no faster.\"\r\n\r\nHere Nathan tried again with all his strength; but he could only bring\r\nthe sides together very slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Now comes the second experiment,\" said Jonas. \"While Nathan is trying\r\nto press the two handles together, you, Rollo, may run your finger into\r\nthe hole, and push up the valve a little.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so. He pushed up the valve a little with his finger, and that\r\nallowed the air to escape through the opening. The consequence was, that\r\nthe bellows collapsed at once under the pressure which Nathan was\r\nexerting upon them.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Jonas, \"you see that when the air is kept in, you cannot\r\nbring the sides together; but when I let the air out, then they come\r\ntogether easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nathan; \"do it again, Rollo.\"\r\n\r\nSo they performed the experiment again. Nathan pulled the handles apart\r\nwide, while Rollo kept his thumb over the nose, to keep the air from\r\nissuing through. Then Nathan tried to press them together; but he could\r\nnot, until Rollo put his finger under, and pushed up the valve a little,\r\nand then they came together again very easily.\r\n\r\n\"The air is a real thing, I verily believe,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I know it is. And now for the third experiment,\r\nJonas.\"\r\n\r\n\"The third experiment,\" said Jonas, \"is this. Turn the bellows bottom\r\nupwards, and try to blow.\"\r\n\r\nNathan did so. He found that he could work the bellows easily--too\r\neasily, in fact; but they did not blow.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your hand opposite the nose, and see if any wind comes,\" said\r\nJonas.\r\n\r\nThey did so; there was no wind, or rather scarcely any.\r\n\r\n\"The reason is,\" said Jonas, \"that, when the bellows are bottom upwards,\r\nthe valve hangs down off from the hole all the time, and lets the air\r\nall out through the hole in the side; and it can come out more easily\r\nthere than through the nose, and so it don't blow well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"that's a pretty good experiment; but what is\r\nthe next? Let me try the next. Nathan, it is my turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next experiment, which is the fifth,----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the fourth,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth, then,\" said Jonas, \"is to prove what I said to you--that\r\nthe air, which is blown out at the nose of the bellows, really comes in\r\nthrough the valve. Let me see,--I want something to make a smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will not paper do?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"here is some brown paper, which will do.\" So Jonas\r\nrolled it up, and told Rollo to set it on fire, and then, when it was\r\nwell burning, to step on it with his foot, and put the flame out.\r\n\r\nRollo did so, and the paper lay in a heap, making a great smoke upon the\r\nhearth, just before the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jonas, \"put the bellows upon its edge, by the side of the\r\npaper, so as to have the valve near the smoke, and then hold still a\r\nminute, until the smoke comes up steadily by the valve.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, Jonas told Nathan to take hold of the nose of the\r\nbellows, to steady it, so that Rollo could blow. He then directed Rollo\r\nto lean the bellows over a little towards the smoke, so that the moving\r\nside should not rub upon the hearth, when he began to blow.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"if you work the bellows, you will see that the\r\nsmoke will be drawn in through the valve, and then will come out through\r\nthe nose.\"\r\n\r\nThis experiment succeeded perfectly well, only just in the midst of the\r\ninterest that they felt, in seeing the smoke come pouring out through\r\nthe nose, they heard a bell ring at the house. They knew at once that\r\nthis bell was for Rollo and Nathan; and so the two boys jumped up from\r\nthe hearth, and ran out to see what was wanted. They went through the\r\nshed into the barn, and thence on till they came to the great barn door,\r\nwhere they had come in. There Rollo stopped,--for he did not like to go\r\nout into the snow,--and asked Dorothy, who was ringing the bell, what\r\nshe wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Nathan?\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"He's here with me,\" said Rollo. Nathan was coming along, as fast as he\r\ncould, through the barn.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want us?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"only we did not know where you were. You may stay\r\nhalf an hour more, and then it will be nearly dinner time.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy then went in, leaving the boys at the great barn door. The door\r\nopened in such a direction, that the wind did not blow in; and Rollo and\r\nNathan looked out for some time, watching the falling snow, and\r\nlistening to the wind, as it roared through the tops of the trees. At\r\nlast, when they began to think of returning to the shop, Rollo said,--\r\n\r\n\"O Nathan, let us go and hide, and then Jonas will not know where we\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Nathan, \"we will.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys accordingly began to look about the barn for a place to hide.\r\nIt was a large barn, with stalls for oxen and cows, and cribs for\r\nhorses, and one or two calf-pens. Then there was a granary in one\r\ncorner, and a tool-room near it, and lofts and scaffolds above. The boys\r\nfound plenty of places to hide in, and it took them some time to decide\r\nwhich to choose. At last, they found a good warm place, by some bundles\r\nof wheat straw, up in the barn chamber; and they amused themselves by\r\nchoosing out large straws, and making tubes of them to blow through.\r\nThey called them their _bellows_.\r\n\r\nThey entirely forgot that they were hid from Jonas, for nearly half an\r\nhour; and then Rollo proposed that they should creep softly down, and\r\nsee what Jonas was about. So they went down stairs on tiptoe; Rollo\r\nfirst, and Nathan following. They crept softly along to the door leading\r\nout into the shed, through which they had to pass in order to get to\r\nthe shop; and Rollo was going to open this softly, when, to his\r\nsurprise, he found it fastened.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Nathan,\" said he, \"this door is fastened.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came it fastened?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Rollo, \"unless Jonas fastened it. I think he must\r\nhave finished his work, and gone into the house; and so he has fastened\r\nthis door.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now he won't come and find us,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo, \"and we must go out the front door. And I don't care\r\nmuch,\" he continued, \"for it is pretty near dinner time.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys then went back to the front door of the barn, and, to their\r\nsurprise and alarm, found that fastened too.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" said Rollo; \"Jonas has fastened us in.\" As Rollo\r\nsaid this, his face assumed an expression of great solicitude, and\r\nNathan began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, Nathan,\" said he; \"we can find some way to get out. But I\r\ndon't see, I confess, what made Jonas lock us in.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that Jonas did not know that the boys were in the barn\r\nwhen he fastened it up. As they did not come back after they had gone to\r\nanswer the bell, he supposed that they had gone into the house; and when\r\nhe was ready to come in himself, he shut and fastened the back doors of\r\nthe barn, as he usually did when he left the shop. He then came around\r\nto the front barn door, and although that was on the sheltered side, so\r\nthat the wind did not blow in, he thought it possible that the wind\r\nmight change, and so drive the snow in upon the barn floor; and\r\ntherefore, to make all safe, he thought that he would shut them, too. He\r\naccordingly shut the great doors, and put the fid into the staple. The\r\nfid is a wooden pin, to be passed through the staple when the doors are\r\nshut, to fasten them. The doors cannot be opened again until the fid is\r\ntaken out.\r\n\r\nRollo went all around the barn, trying to find some place where he could\r\nget out; but he could not find any place at all.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go up stairs,\" said he, at length, to Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O, it will not do any good to go up stairs,\" said Nathan. \"It would\r\nkill us to jump out the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know we can't jump out the window,\" said Rollo, \"but perhaps we can\r\nfind out some way to get down. O, there is a ladder; I remember now,\r\nNathan, there is a ladder. We can get down from the window by the\r\nladder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be afraid to go down the ladder,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O no,\" said Rollo, \"I will go first, and see if it is safe.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the barn chamber. There was a window in\r\nit, with glass, over the great barn door; but Rollo could not get it\r\nopen. He told Nathan that, if he could only get it open, and could find\r\na long pole, he could reach it down, and knock the fid out, and so open\r\nthe great doors. But, with all his efforts, he could not raise the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThere was another window, which had no glass, but was closed by a wooden\r\nshutter, which opened upon hinges like a door. Rollo said he meant to\r\nopen this window. Now, it happened that this window was upon that side\r\nof the barn which was exposed to the wind and storm; and, the moment\r\nthat Rollo had pushed open the shutter a little way, the wind forced it\r\ninstantly from his hand, and slammed it back against the side of the\r\nbarn, with great violence. It almost pulled Rollo himself out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nNathan looked frightened. Rollo himself looked somewhat astonished at\r\nsuch an unexpected effect; but presently said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nathan, I rather think that, if you had had hold of that shutter,\r\nyou would have thought that air was a real thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, that was the _wind_, Rollo; that was the _wind_,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\nRollo did not answer, but went to the ladder, which was standing up\r\nagainst the hay-loft. It was a pretty long, but yet a very light ladder;\r\nand Rollo and Nathan succeeded, after some difficulty, in getting it\r\ndown, and in running the end out of the window. When the lower end\r\nreached the ground, the upper end was two or three feet above the bottom\r\nof the window; so that Rollo could easily get upon it to descend. The\r\nwind and storm, which raged with great violence, were somewhat\r\nterrifying; but he knew that the ladder was secure, the upper part being\r\nconfined in the window; and so he resolutely descended. When he had\r\nfairly reached the ground, he looked up, with an expression of great\r\nsatisfaction upon his countenance, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"There! now, Nathan, for your turn.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nathan was afraid to venture; and Rollo himself was half afraid to\r\nhave him make the attempt. While they were standing in this perplexity,\r\nRollo heard a voice behind him, calling out,--\r\n\r\n\"Rollo.\"\r\n\r\nRollo turned, and saw Dorothy standing by the door.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Rollo?\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I am trying to get Nathan out of the barn,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"How came he in the barn?\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jonas locked us in, and I had to come down the ladder; but Nathan\r\nis afraid, and I can't get him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go to the door, and let him right out?\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said Rollo, laughing, \"I never thought of that. Go down, Nathan,\"\r\nhe continued, \"to the door, and I will go round and knock out the fid.\"\r\n\r\nSo Nathan went down, and Rollo, meeting him there, knocked out the fid,\r\nand released him from his imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What was the first experiment with the bellows, described in\r\n    this chapter? Why could not Nathan press the two sides of the\r\n    bellows together, while the nose was stopped? What was the\r\n    second experiment? What was the effect produced by turning the\r\n    bellows bottom upwards, as in the third experiment? What was the\r\n    fourth experiment? What was the use of the smoke of the paper?\r\n    How were the experiments interrupted? What evidence did Rollo\r\n    and Nathan have that the air was a real substance, when in the\r\n    barn chamber?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, just after tea, Rollo came to his father, who was sitting\r\nby the side of the fire, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Father, I wish we could see the air, as we can the water, and then\r\nperhaps we could try experiments with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we can try experiments with the air as it is,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Can we?\" said Rollo; \"I don't see how.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot see the air, it is true; but then we can see its effects, and\r\nso we can experiment upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at any rate,\" said Rollo, \"we can't build a dam, and make it\r\nspout through a hole, like water.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, \"not exactly. In your dam, for instance, when it\r\nwas full, you had water on one side of the board, and no water on the\r\nother; and then, by opening a hole in the board, the water spouted\r\nthrough; but we cannot very well get air on one side of a partition, and\r\nno air on the other; if we could, it would spout through very much as\r\nthe water did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we do that, sir?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied his father, \"we are all surrounded and enveloped with\r\nair. It spreads in every direction all around us, and rises many miles\r\nabove us. Whereas, in respect to water, you had one little stream before\r\nyou, which you could manage just as you pleased. If you were down at the\r\nbottom of the sea, then the water would be all around you and above you;\r\nand there, even if you could live there, you could not have a dam.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Rollo, \"the water would be everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"and the air is everywhere. If, however, we\r\ncould get it away from any place, as, for instance, from this room, then\r\nbore a hole through the wall, the weight of the air outside would crowd\r\na portion of it through the hole, exactly as the weight of the water\r\nabove the board in your dam crowded a part through the hole in the\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could try it,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"We _can_ try it, in substance,\" said his father, \"in this room; or--no,\r\nthe china closet will be better.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a china closet, which had two doors in it. One door opened\r\ninto the parlor, where Rollo and his father were sitting. The other door\r\nopened into the back part of the entry. Rollo's father explained how he\r\nwas going to perform the experiment, thus:--\r\n\r\n\"If we could, by any means, get all the air out of the closet for a\r\nmoment, then the pressure of the air outside would force a jet of it in\r\nthrough the key-holes of the doors, and the crevices.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can we get the air out?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" said his father, \"get it all out; but we can get a part of\r\nit out by shutting the door quick. The door will carry with it a part of\r\nthe air that was in the closet, and then the outside air will be spouted\r\nin, through the key-hole of the other door. Only we can't see it, as we\r\ncan the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo; \"but I can put my hand there, and feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A better way,\" said his father, \"would be to hold a lamp opposite to\r\nthe key-hole, and see if it blows the flame.\"\r\n\r\nRollo tried the experiment, in the way his father had described. He went\r\ninto the closet with the lamp. He held the lamp opposite to the\r\nkey-hole, and pretty near to it, and then he asked Nathan to shut the\r\nother door suddenly. Nathan, who was standing all ready by the other\r\ndoor, which was about half open, put his two hands against it, and\r\npushed it to, with all his strength, producing a great concussion.\r\n\r\n\"O Nathan,\" said his father, \"you need not be quite so violent as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It succeeded, father, it succeeded,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad it succeeded,\" said his father; \"but Nathan need not have shut\r\nthe door with so much force.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to drive out all the air,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you how to do it,\" said his father.\r\n\r\nRollo's father accordingly arose, and came to the closet door. He\r\nopened the door wide, and then explained to the boys, that the beginning\r\nof the movement of the door, when it was wide open, did not drive out\r\nany air.\r\n\r\n\"For,\" said he, \"there is so large a space between the edge of the door\r\nand the wall, that the air that is put in motion by the movement of the\r\ndoor, can pass directly round the edge, back into the closet again. It\r\nis only when the door is almost shut, when the edge of it comes close to\r\nthe casing all around, that the movement of the door drives the air\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThen he took hold of the latch of the door, and put it almost to, very\r\ngently. He turned the latch so as to prevent its snapping against the\r\ncatch, and then pushed it suddenly into its place three or four times,\r\nopening the door only a very little way every time.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"hold the lamp at the key-hole, and watch the flame,\r\nwhile I shut the door two or three times in this way.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so, Nathan standing all the time by his side. They observed\r\nthat the flame of the lamp was driven into the room every time the door\r\nwas shut; proving that, every time a little of the air was driven out\r\nby the door, a little puff rushed in at the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\"Let us stop up the key-hole,\" said Rollo, \"and then it can't get in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"there are a great many little crevices all\r\naround the closet, where the air can come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we stop those up too?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, \"not so as to make the closet air-tight. For, if\r\nthe crevices could all be stopped exactly, the air would come in through\r\nthe very wood itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there are little pores in wood, that is, little channels that the\r\nsap flowed in when the wood was growing, and the air can pass through\r\nthese.\"\r\n\r\nHere Rollo's father observed that Rollo was looking very intently at the\r\ntable; and he asked him what he was doing: he said he was trying to find\r\nsome of the pores.\r\n\r\n\"You can't see them there,\" said his father. \"St. Domingo mahogany is a\r\nvery hard and close-grained kind of wood. If it was summer, and you\r\ncould dig down and get a small piece of the root of the great elm-tree\r\nin the yard, you could see the pores and channels there.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some more conversation on this subject, Rollo asked his father if\r\nhe could not think of some other experiments for them to try. His father\r\nsaid that he did not just then think of any experiment, but that, if\r\nRollo and Nathan would come and sit down by the fire, he would give them\r\nsome information on the subject. Rollo's mother said that she should\r\nlike to hear too. They accordingly waited until she was ready, and then,\r\nwhen all were seated, Mr. Holiday began thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Air is in many respects much like water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Rollo, \"just like water, only thinner, because, you\r\nsee----\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not interrupt me,\" said his father, \"unless to ask some\r\nquestion, which is necessary to understand what I say. It is entirely\r\nirregular for a pupil, instead of listening to his teacher, to\r\ninterrupt, in order to tell something that he knows himself.\"\r\n\r\nRollo's father smiled, as he said this, but Rollo looked rather ashamed.\r\nThen his father proceeded:--\r\n\r\n\"There is one very remarkable difference between them. Water is not\r\ncompressible by force; but air is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of _compressible_?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Compressible things,\" said his father, \"are those that can be\r\ncompressed, that is, pressed together, so as to take up less room than\r\nthey did before. Sponge is compressible. A pillow is compressible. But\r\niron is not compressible, and water is not compressible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it was,\" said Nathan; \"it is very soft.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very _yielding_,\" replied his father, \"when you press it, but it\r\nis not pressed into any smaller space. It only moves away. If you have a\r\ntumbler half full of water, and press a ball down into it, you could not\r\ncrowd the water into any smaller space than it occupied at first; but,\r\nas fast as the ball went down, the water would come up around the sides\r\nof the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose,\" said Rollo, \"that the ball was just big enough to fit the\r\ntumbler all around; then the water could not come up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said his father, \"you could not crowd the ball down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could not a _very_ strong man?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his father, \"the water cannot be sensibly compressed. But\r\nnow, if the tumbler contained only air, and if a ball were to be put in\r\nat the top, just large enough to fit the tumbler exactly, and if a\r\nstrong man were to crowd it down with all his strength, he would,\r\nperhaps, compress the air into half the space which it occupied before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the tumbler would break,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"and the tumbler will answer only for a\r\nsupposition; but for a real experiment it would be best to have a\r\ncylinder of iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a cylinder?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"An iron vessel, shaped like a tumbler, only as large at the bottom as\r\nit is at the top, would be a cylinder. Now, if there was a cylinder of\r\niron, with the inside turned perfectly true, and a brass piston fitted\r\nto it----\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a piston?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"A piston,\" said his father, \"is a sort of stopper, exactly fitted to\r\nthe inside of a cylinder, so as to slide up and down. It is made to fit\r\nperfectly, and then it is oiled, so as to go up and down without much\r\nfriction, that is, hard rubbing. There is a sort of stem coming up from\r\nthe middle of the piston, called the piston rod, which is to draw up the\r\npiston, and to press it down by.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued his father, \"if a strong man had a cylinder like this,\r\nwith a piston fitted to it, and a strong handle across the top of the\r\npiston rod, perhaps he might press the air into one half the space which\r\nit occupied before. That is, if the cylinder was full of air when he put\r\nthe piston in, perhaps he could get the piston down half way to the\r\nbottom. Then the air would be twice as _dense_ as it was before; that\r\nis, there would be twice as much of it in the same space as there was\r\nbefore. It would be twice as compact and heavy. This is called\r\n_condensing_ air. The philosophers have ingenious instruments for\r\ncondensing air.\r\n\r\n\"If, however, a man condenses air in this way, by crowding down a\r\npiston, he does not begin the condensation when the piston begins to\r\ndescend. The air is condensed a great deal before he begins. All the air\r\naround us is condensed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How comes it condensed?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you recollect that, when you bored a hole through the board in the\r\nbottom of your dam, the water spouted out.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father,\" said Rollo, \"we pulled the plug out; Jonas bored the\r\nhole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said his father, \"the water spouted out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"What made it?\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the water above it was heavy, and pressed down upon it, and\r\ncrowded it out through the hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"and the deeper the water, the more heavily it\r\nwas pressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo, \"and the farther it spouted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was pressed down by the load of such a high column of\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied his father, \"it is just so with the air. The air all\r\naround us is pressed down by the load of all that is above us. We are,\r\nin fact, down at the bottom of a great ocean of air, and the air here is\r\nloaded down very heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How heavy?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"O, very heavy indeed,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, air is pretty light,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"but then the column of it is very high.\"\r\n\r\n\"How high?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, between thirty and forty miles. But it grows thinner and thinner\r\ntowards the top; so it is not as heavy, by any means, as a column of air\r\nwould be, thirty miles high, and as dense all the way up as it is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes it grow thinner and thinner towards the top?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said his father, \"that which is near the top, has not as much\r\nload of air above it, to press it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that which is _at_ the top,\" said Rollo, \"has none above it, to\r\npress it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\n\"And how thin is it there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"What, nobody at all?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"No, I believe not; at least I do not; and I don't know that any body\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do they know, then, how high it is?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"The philosophers have calculated in some way or other, though I don't\r\nexactly know how. I believe they have ascertained how great the\r\npressure of the air is here at the surface of the earth, and have\r\ncalculated in some way, from that, how high the air must be to produce\r\nsuch a pressure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how high must it be?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, between thirty and forty miles,\" said Rollo; \"father told us\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" continued his father, \"water, thirty or forty feet deep,\r\nwould produce as great a pressure as a column of air of thirty or forty\r\nmiles. That is, the air around presses about as heavily, and would force\r\na jet of air through a hole with about as much force, as water would,\r\ncoming out at the bottom of a dam, as high as a common three-story\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nThese explanations were all very interesting to Rollo and to his mother;\r\nbut Nathan found it rather hard to understand them all, and he began to\r\nbe somewhat restless and uneasy. At length he said,--\r\n\r\n\"And now, father, haven't you almost done telling about the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said his father; \"I have told you enough for this time; only\r\nyou must remember it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I can remember it quite all,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, remember the general principle, at any rate,\" said his\r\nfather, \"which is this--that we live at the bottom of a vast ocean of\r\nair, and that the lower portions of this air are pressed down by the\r\nload of all the air above; that, being so pressed, the lower air is\r\ncondensed,--so that we live in the midst of air that is pressed down,\r\nand condensed, by the load of all that is above it; and that,\r\nconsequently, whenever the air is taken away, even in part, from any\r\nplace, as you removed some of it from the china closet, the pressure\r\nupon the air outside forces the air in through every opening it can\r\nfind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that is a little too much for me to remember,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\nNathan's father and mother laughed on hearing this, though Nathan did\r\nnot know what they were laughing at. His father told him that he could\r\nnot expect him to remember all; and that, to pay him for his particular\r\nattention, he would tell him a story.\r\n\r\nSo he took Nathan up in his lap, and told him a very curious story of a\r\nboy, who went about the yard with a little dog upon one of his\r\nshoulders, a cat upon the other, and a squirrel on his head. The\r\nsquirrel was tame.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    Why cannot experiments be performed upon the pressure of air, as\r\n    conveniently as upon the pressure of water? How did Rollo's\r\n    father contrive to remove a part of the air from the china\r\n    closet? Where did they expect that the air would be forced into\r\n    the closet? How were they to make this effect visible? Did the\r\n    experiment succeed? Suppose the key-hole had been stopped up;\r\n    where would the air have been forced in? Suppose all the\r\n    crevices had been closed. Is water compressible? Is air\r\n    compressible? What is the shape of a cylinder? What is a piston?\r\n    How might air be compressed by means of a cylinder and piston?\r\n    What was the general principle which Rollo's father stated, in\r\n    conclusion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBALLOONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening, Rollo and Nathan had another conversation with their\r\nfather, respecting air. When they were all seated, he commenced as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"I told you yesterday, that air may be compressed by force, while water\r\ncannot be. It has another property, which is in some respects the\r\nreverse of this. It springs back into its original bulk, when the\r\npressure is removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Nathan; \"I don't exactly understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you remember what I said about the experiment with the iron\r\ncylinder and a piston to fit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"What was the experiment?\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, if a man were to press the piston down hard, he could crowd the\r\nair all into the lower half of the cylinder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father. \"Now, the property I am going to tell you\r\nabout this evening is this--that, if the man lets go of the piston rod,\r\nthe air that is condensed into the bottom of the cylinder, will spring\r\nup, and force the piston up again. This property is called _elasticity_.\r\nIt is sometimes called the _expansive force_ of the air. For it is a\r\nforce tending to expand the air, that is, to swell it out into its\r\noriginal dimensions. This is another great difference between air and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as all the air around us,\" continued Rollo's father, \"is pressed\r\ndown very heavily, and is condensed a great deal, it is all the time\r\nendeavoring to expand; and it would expand, were it not that the great\r\nburden of the air above it keeps it condensed. But water is not\r\ncompressed, and has no tendency to expand. The water of Rollo's dam, for\r\ninstance, had all the weight of the atmosphere resting upon it, but it\r\ndid not compress it at all, and so it did not tend to expand.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said his father, \"I cannot perform any experiment, to show\r\nyou that air tends strongly to expand or swell out into a great space,\r\nwhile water does not; but I can make a supposition, which will\r\nillustrate it. Suppose we had a large, but very thin, glass bottle,\r\nfilled with water, and put down upon the floor in the middle of this\r\nroom. Suppose, also, that we had another bottle, of the same size and\r\nshape, filled with air, and we put that down upon the floor by the side\r\nof the other; both bottles being stopped very tight. Now, if we could by\r\nany means suddenly take away all the air from the room, so that there\r\nshould be nothing around the bottles, then the bottle of water would\r\nremain just as it is, for the glass would have nothing to support but\r\nthe weight of the water, and it would be strong enough for that. But the\r\nbottle of air would fly all to pieces; for that would not rest quietly,\r\nlike the water, satisfied with the space which it already has, and only\r\npressing with its own weight upon the sides of the glass; but it would\r\nimmediately expand with so much force as to break the thin glass all to\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it!\" exclaimed Rollo and Nathan together. \"And would it make a\r\nloud noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied their father, \"I presume it would make a loud explosion;\r\nthat is, if the air in the room around it could by any means be all at\r\nonce and suddenly removed.\r\n\r\n\"And so you must remember,\" he continued, \"that there are two very\r\nremarkable differences between air and water. Air may be condensed by\r\npressure, and, as it exists all around us, is greatly condensed by the\r\npressure of the air above, and it may be compressed more. And air is\r\nexpansive, while water is not. Whenever the pressure upon it is removed,\r\nit suddenly expands, or spreads out in all directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"O dear me!\" said Nathan, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can't understand it very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you?\" said his father. \"Well, I must admit that you are rather\r\ntoo young to study pneumatics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pneumatics?\" repeated Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father; \"that is the name of this science.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Then it sailed slowly away.\"--Page 85.]\r\n\r\n\"What, the science of air?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"the science which treats of air, and of all\r\nother compressible and expansive fluids. But let me think. I must try to\r\ntell you something which Nathan can understand and be interested in. If\r\nI had a very light feather, I could let him perform an experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would a little down do?\" said Rollo's mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"that would be better than a feather.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Holiday then went and brought a little down, and handed it to\r\nRollo's father. Now, there was a lamp upon the table, of a peculiar\r\nkind, called a study lamp. It had a glass tube, called a chimney, around\r\nthe wick, and consequently around the flame itself, being round, like a\r\nring.\r\n\r\nRollo's father told Nathan to hold the down over the top of this glass\r\nchimney, and then to let it go.\r\n\r\nNathan did so. The little tuft of down was wafted up into the air, quite\r\nhigh above the lamp, and then it sailed slowly away, and fell down upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\"I know what makes it rise,\" said Rollo. \"It is the heat. The heat makes\r\nit rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" said his father. \"Then take the down, and lay it\r\ngently upon the hearth, before the fire, as near as you can.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so. He had to take his hand away very quick, for it was quite\r\nhot there. The little tuft remained quietly upon the hearth where he\r\nplaced it.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said his father, \"is not that a hotter place than it was over\r\nthe lamp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if it was heat that made it rise, why does not it rise now?\"\r\n\r\nRollo could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you how it was,\" said his father. \"Heat makes air more\r\nexpansive. When air is heated, it swells; when it is cool, it shrinks\r\nagain. Now, if it swells, it becomes lighter, and so it is buoyed up by\r\nthe heavier air around it; just as wood at the bottom of the sea would\r\nbe buoyed up, and would rise to the surface of the water. Now, the heat\r\nof the lamp heats the air that is in the glass chimney, and swells it.\r\nThis makes it lighter; and so the air around it, which is heavier,\r\nbuoys it up, and it carries up the feather with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the down, father,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the down,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Then it seems to me, after all,\" said Rollo, \"that it is the heat which\r\nmakes it rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"it does, indirectly. It expands the air; that\r\nmakes it lighter; then the heavy air around it buoys it up, and, when it\r\ngoes up, it carries up the down. So that it is not strictly correct to\r\nsay, that the heat carries it up. The heat sets in operation a train of\r\ncauses and effects, the last of which results in carrying up the\r\nfeather.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued his father, \"there is always a stream of air going up,\r\nwherever there is a lamp, or a fire, or heat, which heats the air in any\r\nway. The expanded air from a fire goes up chimney. The cool and heavy\r\nair in the room and out of doors crowds it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The air out of doors?\" said Rollo. \"How can that crowd it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it presses in through all the crevices and openings all around\r\nthe room, and crowds the light air up the chimney. All the smoke is\r\ncarried up too with it, and it comes pouring out at the top of the\r\nchimney all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can see that the air presses in at all these crevices,\" continued\r\nRollo's father, \"by experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What experiment is it?\" said Rollo; \"let us try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will let Nathan try it,\" said his father, \"and you may go with him\r\nand see the effect. First,\" he continued, \"you see by the smoke, that\r\nthe air really goes up the chimney; and I will show you that other air\r\nreally crowds into the space, from other parts of the room.\"\r\n\r\nSo he took a lamp from the table,--not the study lamp; it was a common\r\nlamp,--and held it at various places in the opening of the fireplace, by\r\nthe jambs and near the upper part; and Rollo and Nathan saw that the\r\nflame, in all cases, was turned in towards the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I see it is drawn in.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father; \"strictly speaking, it is not _drawn_ in; it is\r\npressed in, by the cool and heavy air of the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" said Rollo's mother, \"that the chimney _drew_ the air from\r\nthe room into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what is generally said,\" replied Mr. Holiday, \"but it is not\r\nstrictly true. The common idea is, that the hot air rises in the\r\nchimney, and so draws the air from the room to supply its place; but\r\nthis is not so. In the first place, nothing can rise unless it is forced\r\nup. The lightest things have some weight, and would, if left to\r\nthemselves, fall. The hottest and lightest air in a chimney would fall\r\nto the earth, if there was no cooler and heavier air around it, to force\r\nit to rise;--just as the lightest cork, which would rise very quick from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, would fall back again very quick, if the water\r\nwas not there.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, then, Nathan and Rollo, that, when a fire is built in a\r\nfireplace, so as to warm the air in the chimney, it makes this air not\r\nso heavy; and then the cool air all around it in the room and out of\r\ndoors, presses in, and crowds under the light air, and makes it\r\nascend.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father,\" said Nathan, \"you said I might perform an experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I am ready now. Take the lamp, and carry it around the room,\r\nand hold it opposite any little opening you can find.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't find any little openings,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O yes,\" said his father; \"the key-hole of the door is a little opening,\r\nand there is a narrow crevice all around the door; and you will find\r\nlittle crevices around the windows. Now, hold the lamp opposite any of\r\nthese, and you will see that the air presses in.\"\r\n\r\nSo Nathan went with the lamp, Rollo following him, and held the lamp\r\nopposite to the key-hole, and the crevices around the door and windows;\r\nonly, when he came to the window, his father told him to be very careful\r\nnot to set the curtain on fire.\r\n\r\nRollo wanted Nathan to let him try it once; and so Nathan gave him the\r\nlamp. He said he meant to make a crevice; and so he pushed up the window\r\na very little way, and held the lamp opposite to the opening. The air\r\npressed the flame in towards the room, in all cases.\r\n\r\n\"People commonly say, that it is _drawn_ in,\" said his father, \"but that\r\nis not strictly correct; it is really _pressed_ in. There is no power of\r\nattraction, in the air that is in the room, to draw in the air that is\r\nout of doors, through the crevices; but the air that is out of doors, is\r\nso heavy, that it presses in, and crowds the warm and light air up the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said his father, \"I cannot tell you anything more this\r\nevening; but, if you remember this, I will give you some further\r\ninstruction another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Nathan, \"only I wish you would tell me a little story,\r\nas you did last evening. Have not I been still?\"\r\n\r\nHis father had noticed, that he had been very still and attentive, but\r\ndid not think before, that it was in expectation of being rewarded with\r\na story.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said his father, \"I will tell you a story, or give you a little\r\nadvice. How should you like a little advice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, a little advice; just which you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"I advise you, then,--let me see,--what shall I advise you?--No, on the\r\nwhole, I will tell you a story. Once there was a man, and he was a\r\nphilosopher. He understood all that I have been explaining to you about\r\nthe air being light when it was hot. So he got some very thin paper, and\r\nmade a large paper bag. He cut the paper very curiously, and pasted it\r\ntogether at the edges in such a way, that the bag, when it was done, was\r\nround, like a ball; and it had a round opening at the bottom of it. In\r\nfact, it was a large paper ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"How large was it?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"It was so large, that, when it was swelled out full, it would have been\r\nhigher than your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, what a large ball!\" said Nathan. \"But what was it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the man thought, as hot air is lighter than cool air, and floats\r\nup, that perhaps, if he could fill his paper ball with hot air, it would\r\ngo up too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did it?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father. \"He filled it with hot air; and the hot air was\r\nso light, that it rose up and carried the paper ball with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he get the hot air into it?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he held it over a little fire, with the mouth down. Then the hot\r\nair from the fire went up into the ball, and swelled it out full.\"\r\n\r\n\"How high did it go?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"O, it soared away,\" said his father, \"away up into the air, very high;\r\nuntil at length it got cool, and then it came down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see such a ball as that,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Such a ball as that is called a _balloon_,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could see a balloon,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What is the important difference between air and water, which\r\n    was explained in the last chapter, and mentioned in this? Does\r\n    the air tend to expand again after it is compressed? What is\r\n    this property of the air called? Is the air around us already\r\n    condensed, or is it in its natural state? What causes it to be\r\n    condensed? Suppose a thin glass vessel were to be filled with\r\n    air, and another with water, and the air suddenly removed from\r\n    the room around them; what would be the effects? What effect\r\n    does heat have upon the expansibility of air? How may this\r\n    effect be made to appear over a lamp? In a chimney? What was the\r\n    story which Rollo's father told Nathan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time after this, Rollo, and Nathan, and James, were playing in the\r\nshed, one pleasant morning in the spring. They were building with sticks\r\nof wood, which they piled in various ways, so as to make houses. They\r\ntook care not to pile the wood, in any case, higher than their\r\nshoulders, for Jonas had told them that, if they piled the wood higher\r\nthan that, there would be danger of its falling down upon them.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Rollo went into the house a few minutes, and James and\r\nNathan went to the open part of the shed, and began to look out of\r\ndoors. The sun was shining pleasantly, but the ground was wet, being\r\ncovered with streams and pools of water, and melting snow-banks.\r\n\r\n\"What a pleasant day!\" said James. \"I wish it was dry, so that we could\r\ngo out better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could fly,\" said Nathan, \"for it is very pleasant up in the\r\nair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a balloon,\" said James. \"If we had a balloon, we could go\r\nup in the air, easier than to fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"O James,\" said Nathan, \"you could not get into a balloon if you had\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Nathan, \"it would not be big enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Nathan,\" said James, \"a balloon is bigger than this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"O James, it is not higher than my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said James, \"I know it is. I have read about balloons bigger\r\nthan a house.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my father,\" said Nathan, putting down his foot in a very positive\r\nair, \"my father told me himself, that a balloon was about as high as my\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys disputed some time longer upon the subject, and finally, when\r\nRollo came out of the house, they both appealed to him very eagerly to\r\nsettle the dispute.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't a balloon higher than Nathan's head?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Is it as high as a house?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I know,\" said Rollo, \"that a man made a balloon once about as high\r\nas Nathan's head, because my father said so; but perhaps it was a little\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said James, \"I know it must be a little one; for balloons are big\r\nenough for men to go up in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O James,\" said Nathan, \"I don't believe it. Besides, the fire would\r\nburn 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fire?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"The fire they burn under the balloons, to make the air hot,\" said\r\nNathan.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe they have any fire,\" said James.\r\n\r\nJust then Nathan, happening to look around, saw Jonas standing behind\r\nthem; he had just come out of the house, and was going out to his work.\r\nHearing the boys engaged in this dispute, he stopped to listen. The boys\r\nboth appealed to Jonas.\r\n\r\nJonas heard all that they had to say, and then replied,--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you much about going up in a balloon, but I can tell you\r\nsomething about getting along pleasantly down here upon the earth, which\r\nI think may be of service to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that you will neither of you get along very pleasantly until you\r\ncan bear to have any body else mistaken, without contradicting them.\r\nJames, you think Nathan is mistaken about the size of a balloon, do\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know he is,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jonas, \"now why not let him remain mistaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,--I don't know,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"He isn't willing to be convinced, is he, that a balloon is as big as a\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said James, \"he is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you let him remain unconvinced? Why should you insist on\r\nsetting him right, when he don't want to be set right?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Nathan, suppose that James is mistaken, in thinking that the\r\nballoon is so big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nathan, \"and that men can get into it, and go up in the\r\nair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, if he wants to believe that balloons are so big, why are you\r\nnot willing that he should? Why should you insist upon it that he\r\nshould know that they are smaller?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I _know_,\" said Nathan, very positively, \"that they are small;\r\nand, besides, the paper would not be strong enough to bear a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not ask you,\" said Jonas, \"why _you_ believed that men could not\r\ngo up in balloons, but why you were so anxious to make James believe so.\r\nWhy not let him be mistaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--because,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Nathan,\" continued Jonas, \"the world is full of people that\r\nare continually mistaken; and if you go about trying to set them all\r\nright by disputing them, you'll have a hard row to hoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hard what?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"A hard row to hoe,\" repeated Jonas. \"It's never of any service to\r\nattempt to convince people that don't want to be convinced; especially\r\nif they are wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially if they are wrong!\" repeated Rollo, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas. \"The very worst time to argue with a boy, is when\r\nhe is wrong, and does not want to be set right. It is a great deal\r\nharder to get along in argument with one who is right, than with one who\r\nis wrong; for the one who is wrong, disputes; the one who is right,\r\nreasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jonas,\" said James, \"which of us was disputing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both of you,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Both of us,\" said James; \"but you said that only the one who was wrong,\r\ndisputed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Jonas, \"you were both wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both wrong! O Jonas!\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, both wrong,\" replied Jonas; and so saying, he was going away to\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n\"But stop a minute longer,\" said James, \"and tell us how it is about the\r\nballoon; we want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no,\" said Jonas, \"you don't want to know; you want to _conquer_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't really wish to learn any thing; but you want to have me\r\ndecide the case, because each of you hopes that I shall decide in his\r\nfavor. You want the pleasure of a victory, not the pleasure of\r\nacquiring knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Jonas,\" said Nathan, \"we do really want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jonas, \"I can't stop now to tell you; perhaps I will this\r\nevening; but I advise you always, after this, not to contradict people,\r\nand dispute with them, when they say things that you don't believe. Do\r\nas the gentleman did, when the man said the moon was a fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he let him say it as much as he wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us all about it,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Jonas, \"once there was a man, and he saw the moon\r\ncoming up behind the trees, and thought it was a large house burning up.\r\nHe went along a little way, and he met a vulgar fellow, riding in a\r\ncarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Riding in a carriage!\" repeated Rollo, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"handsomely dressed. 'Sir,' said the man, 'see that\r\ngreat fire!'\r\n\r\n\"'It isn't a fire, you fool,' said the vulgar fellow; 'it's nothing but\r\nthe moon.'\r\n\r\n\"'The moon! no it isn't,' said the man; 'it is a monstrous great fire.\r\nDon't you see how it blazes up?'\r\n\r\n\"'It is not a fire, I tell you,' said the vulgar fellow.\r\n\r\n\"'I tell you 'tis,' said the man.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't know any thing about it,' said the vulgar fellow.\r\n\r\n\"'And you don't know the moon from a house on fire,' said the man, and\r\nso passed on.\r\n\r\n\"A minute or two after this, he met a gentleman driving a team.\"\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman driving a team!\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"with a frock on. He was tired and weary, having\r\ndriven all day. The man asked him if he did not see that house on fire.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah,' said the gentleman, 'I thought it was the moon.'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said the man, 'it is a house on fire.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said the gentleman, 'I am very sorry if it is. I hope they'll\r\nbe able to put it out!'\r\n\r\n\"So saying, he started his team along, and bade the man good evening.\"\r\n\r\nJonas then, having finished his story, stepped out of the shed, and\r\nwent along towards the barn; Nathan called out after him to say,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jonas, I don't understand how the gentleman came to be driving a\r\nteam all day.\"\r\n\r\nJonas did not reply to this, but only began to laugh heartily, and to\r\nwalk on. Nathan turned back into the shed, saying, he did not see what\r\nJonas was laughing at.\r\n\r\nThe boys wanted very much to have the question about the balloon\r\nsettled; and, after some further conversation on the subject, they\r\nconcluded to go in and ask their mother. So they all three went in.\r\nRollo proposed this plan, and he led the way into the house. He found\r\nhis mother sitting in the parlor at her work.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said she, \"have you got tired of your play?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother,\" said Rollo, \"but we want to know about balloons: how big\r\nare they?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, some of them,\" said she, \"are very large.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't they as big as this house?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe they have been made as big,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"But, mother,\" said Nathan, \"father told me, his very self, that they\r\nwere no higher than my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no,\" said his mother; \"he said that a man made _one_ which was about\r\nas high as your head; but that was only a little one, for experiment.\r\nWhen they make large ones, for use, they are as high as this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"For use, mother? what use?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Men go up in them, don't they, aunt?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Not _in_ them, exactly,\" said his aunt. \"They could not live in them,\r\nbut they go up _by means_ of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they have a kind of basket, which hangs down below the balloon,\r\nand they get into that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew they could not get into the balloon,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have had a dispute about it,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Why,--yes,\" said Nathan, with hesitation, \"we disputed a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to hear that,\" said his mother, \"for disputing seldom does\r\nany good. The fact is, however, that men have often been carried up by\r\nballoons, but they never get into them. They could not live in them.\r\nThey could not breathe the kind of air which balloons are filled with.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hot air,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his mother, \"the kind of balloon which your father told you\r\nof was filled with hot air; but the balloons which people generally use\r\nto go up with, are filled with another kind of air, which is very light\r\nwhen it is cool. They make an enormous bag of silk, and fill it with\r\nthis light air, which they make in barrels; and then, when the bag is\r\nfilled, it floats away above their heads, and pulls hard upon the\r\nfastening. There is a net all over it, and the ends of the net are drawn\r\ntogether below, and are fastened to the basket, or car, where the man is\r\nto sit. When it is all ready, the man gets into the car, and then they\r\nlet go the fastenings, and away the great bag goes, and carries the man\r\nwith it, away up into the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then how does he get down?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he can open a hole in the bag, and let some of the light air out;\r\nand then he begins to come down slowly. If he comes down too fast, or if\r\nhe finds that he is coming into the water, or down upon any dangerous\r\nplace, there is a way by which he can make his balloon go up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What way is it, aunt?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he has some bags of sand in his balloon,\" said his aunt; \"and the\r\nballoon is made large enough to carry him and his sand-bags too. Then,\r\nif he finds that he is coming down too fast, he just pours out some of\r\nhis sand, and that makes his car lighter; and so the balloon will carry\r\nhim up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good plan,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his mother; \"the reason why he takes sand is, because that\r\nwill not hurt any body by falling upon them. If he should take stones,\r\nor any other heavy, solid things, and should drop them out of his car,\r\nthey might possibly fall upon some body, and hurt them. So he takes sand\r\nin bags, and, when he wants to lighten his balloon, he just pours the\r\nsand out.\"\r\n\r\nRollo's mother then told the boys that there was a large book, which had\r\nseveral stories in it of men's going up in balloons, and that she would\r\nget it for them. So she left her work, and went out of the room; but in\r\na few minutes she returned, bringing with her two very large, square\r\nbooks, with blue covers. One of them had pictures in it, and among the\r\nrest there were pictures of balloons. She opened the other book, and\r\nfound the place where there was an account of balloons, and she showed\r\nthe place to Rollo.\r\n\r\nShe told the boys that they had better go out in the kitchen, or into\r\nthe shed, if it was warm enough, and read the account.\r\n\r\n\"You and James, Rollo,\" said she, \"can read by turns, and let Nathan\r\nhear. Then, when the plates are referred to, you must look into the\r\nother book and find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"we will; only, mother, if you would let us sit down\r\nhere and read it--and then, if there is any thing which we cannot\r\nunderstand, you can tell us what it means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied his mother, \"you may sit down here upon the sofa.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boys sat down upon the sofa. They put Nathan between them, so\r\nthat he might look over. Rollo and James took turns to read, and they\r\ncontinued reading about balloons for more than an hour. There was one\r\nstory of a sheep, which a man carried up in his car, under a balloon,\r\nand then let him drop, from a great height, with a parachute over his\r\nhead, to make him fall gently. And he did fall gently. He came down to\r\nthe ground without being hurt at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    How was the subject of balloons introduced into the\r\n    conversation? What was Nathan's opinion about the possibility of\r\n    being carried up by a balloon? What was the dispute about the\r\n    size of balloons? What was Nathan's evidence? What was James's\r\n    evidence? What did Jonas say when they appealed to him? What was\r\n    the story that he related? Which of the boys did he finally say\r\n    was wrong? Whom did the boys appeal to afterwards? What did\r\n    Rollo's mother say about the size of balloons? How did she say\r\n    that large balloons were filled? How can they make the balloon\r\n    come down? How can they make it go up again, if they wish to do\r\n    so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTASKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this, there commenced a long storm of rain. Rollo and\r\nNathan were glad to see it on one account, for their mother told them it\r\nwould melt away the snow, and bring on the spring. The first day, they\r\namused themselves pretty well, during their play hours, in the shed and\r\nin the garret; but on the second day, they began to be tired. Nathan\r\ncame two or three times to his mother, to ask her what he should do; and\r\nRollo himself, though, being older, his resources might naturally be\r\nexpected to be greater, seemed to be out of employment.\r\n\r\nAt last, their mother proposed that they should come and sit down by\r\nher, and she would tell them something more about the air. \"How should\r\nyou like that, Rollo?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Why, pretty well,\" said Rollo; but he spoke in an indifferent and\r\nhesitating manner, which showed that he did not feel much interest in\r\nhis mother's proposal.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ can't understand very well about the air,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\nTheir mother, finding that the boys did not wish much to hear any\r\nconversation about the air, said nothing more about it just then, and\r\nRollo and Nathan got some books, and began to read; but somehow or\r\nother, they did not find the books very interesting, and Rollo, after\r\nreading a little while, put down his book, and went to the window,\r\nsaying that he wished it would stop raining. Nathan followed him, and\r\nthey both looked out of the window with a weary and disconsolate air.\r\n\r\nTheir mother looked at them, and then said to herself, \"They have not\r\nenergy and decision enough to set themselves about something useful, and\r\nin fact I ought not to expect that they should have. I must supply the\r\nwant, by my energy and decision.\"\r\n\r\nThen she said aloud to Rollo and Nathan,--\r\n\r\n\"I want you, boys, to go up into the garret, and under the sky-light you\r\nwill see a large box. Open this box, and you will find it filled with\r\nfeathers. Select from these feathers three or four which are the most\r\ndowny and soft about the stem, and bring them down to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they for?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you,\" replied his mother, \"when you have brought them to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo and Nathan went up into the garret, and brought the feathers.\r\nThey carried them to their mother. She said that they would answer very\r\nwell, and she laid them gently down upon the table.\r\n\r\nThen she took up her scissors, and began to cut off some of the lightest\r\ndown, saying, at the same time,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, children, I am going to give you some writing to do, about _the\r\nair_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Writing?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his mother. \"I am going to explain to you something about\r\nthe air, and then you must write down what I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't write,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his mother, \"but you can tell Rollo what you would wish to\r\nsay, and he will write it for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, mother,\" said Rollo, \"I don't think that that will be very good\r\nplay.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his mother, \"I don't give it to you for play. It will be\r\nquite hard work. I hope you will take hold of it energetically, and do\r\nit well.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said she, \"I am going to perform some experiments for you,\r\nbefore I tell you what I want you to write.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, she had cut off the downy part of several feathers, and\r\nhad laid them together in a little heap. Then she took a fine thread,\r\nand tied this little tuft of down to the end of it. Then she took up the\r\nthread by the other end, and handed it to Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"There, Rollo,\" said she. \"Now, do you remember what your father told\r\nyou, the other day, about the effect of heat upon air?\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes it light,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"And why does it make it light?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't exactly recollect,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because it swells it; it makes it expand; so that the same quantity of\r\nair spreads over a greater space; and this makes it lighter, But cool\r\nor cold air is heavier, because it is more condensed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, wherever there is heat,\" continued his mother, \"the air is made\r\nlighter, and the cool and heavy air around presses in under it, and\r\nbuoys it up. This produces currents of air. You recollect, don't you,\r\nthat your father explained all this to you the other day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I remember it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said his mother, \"now you and Nathan may take this little tuft,\r\nand carry it about to various places, and hold it up by its thread, and\r\nit will show you the way the air is moving; and then you may come to me,\r\nand I will explain to you why it moves that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Rollo, \"come, Nathan, let us go. First we will hold it at\r\nthe key-hole of the door.\"\r\n\r\nRollo held the end of the thread up opposite to the door, in such a way,\r\nthat the tuft was exactly before the key-hole. The tuft was at once\r\nblown out into the room.\r\n\r\n\"O, see, Nathan, how it blows out. The air is coming in through the\r\nkey-hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his mother; \"when there is a fire in the room, and none in\r\nthe entry, then the cold air in the entry runs down through the\r\nkey-hole into the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"It don't run down, mother,\" said Rollo; \"it blows right in straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I ought to have said it spouts in,\" said his mother, \"just as\r\nthe water did from the hole in your dam. And, now,\" she continued, \"come\r\nand hold the tuft near the chimney.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so; and he found that it was carried in, proving, as their\r\nfather had showed them before, that the heavy, cold air, pressing into\r\nthe room, crowded the warm, light air up the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"Now, should you think,\" said their mother, \"that the cold air could\r\ncome in through the key-hole, as fast as it goes up the chimney?\"\r\n\r\nBoth Rollo and Nathan thought that it could not.\r\n\r\n\"Then go all around the room,\" said she, \"and see if you can find any\r\nother place, where it comes in. For it is plain, you see, that the light\r\nair cannot be driven up chimney any faster than cold and heavy air comes\r\nin to drive it up and take its place.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo and Nathan went around the room, holding their tuft at all the\r\nplaces they could find, where they supposed there could be openings for\r\nthe cold air to press in. They found currents coming in around the\r\nwindows, and by the hinges of the doors; and at length Rollo said, he\r\nmeant to open the window a little way, and see if the cold air from out\r\nof doors would not press in there too. He did so, and the tuft was blown\r\nin very far, showing that the cold air from out of doors pressed in very\r\nstrongly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if all these openings were to be stopped,\" said their mother,\r\n\"then no cold air could crowd into the room; and of course the hot air\r\ncould not be buoyed up into the chimney, and a great deal of the hot air\r\nand smoke would come into the room. This very often happens when houses\r\nare first built, and the rooms are very tight.\r\n\r\n\"But now, Rollo,\" she continued, \"suppose that the door was opened wide;\r\nthen should not you think that _more_ cold and heavy air would press in,\r\nthan could go up the chimney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, a great deal more,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Try it,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\nSo Rollo opened the door, and held his tuft in the passage-way; and he\r\nfound that the air was pressing in very strongly through the open space.\r\nWherever he held it, it was blown into the room a great deal, showing\r\nthat the heavy air pressed in, in a torrent.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as much warm air must go out,\" said she, \"as there is cold air\r\ncoming in; but I don't believe that you and Rollo can find out where it\r\ngoes out.\"\r\n\r\nRollo looked all around the room, but he could not see any opening,\r\nexcept the chimney and the door, and the little crevices, which he had\r\nobserved about the finishing of the room. He said he could not find any\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHis mother then told him to hold his tuft down near the bottom of the\r\ndoor-way. He did so, and found that the current of air was there very\r\nstrong. The tuft swung into the room very far.\r\n\r\n\"Now hold it up a little higher,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\nRollo obeyed, and he found that it was still pressed in, but not so\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\"Higher,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\nRollo raised it as high as he could reach. The thread was of such a\r\nlength, that the tuft hung about opposite to his shoulder. The tuft was\r\nstill pressed in, but not nearly as far as before.\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" said his mother, \"that the air pours in the fastest at the\r\nlowest point, where the weight and pressure of the air above it are the\r\ngreatest; just as, in your dam, the water from the lowest holes spouted\r\nout the farthest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it is very much like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued his mother, \"you see that a great deal of air comes in,\r\nand if you look up chimney, you will see that there is scarcely room for\r\nso much to go up there;--and yet just as much must go out as comes in.\r\n\r\n\"Get the step-ladder,\" said his mother, \"and stand up upon it, and so\r\nhold your tuft in the upper part of the door-way.\"\r\n\r\nThere was in the china closet a small piece of furniture, very\r\nconvenient about a house, called a step-ladder. It consisted of two\r\nwooden steps, and was made and kept there to stand upon, in order to\r\nreach the high shelves. Rollo brought out the step-ladder, and placed it\r\nin the door-way, and then ascended it. From the top he could reach\r\nnearly to the top of the door; but then, as his tuft was at the end of\r\nthe thread, it hung down, of course, some little distance below his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why, mother,\" said Rollo, \"it goes _out_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" repeated Nathan, \"it goes out.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Rollo found that the tuft, instead of swinging into the room,\r\nwas carried out towards the entry.\r\n\r\n\"You have found out, then,\" said his mother, \"where the hot air of the\r\nroom goes to, to make room for the cold air, that comes in from the\r\nentry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, out into the entry,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Through the upper part of the door,\" said his mother. \"Suppose the\r\nentry were full of water, and the parlor full of air, and the door was\r\nshut, and the door and the walls were water-tight. Now, if you were to\r\nopen the door, you see that the water, being heavier, would flow in,\r\nthrough the lower part of the door-way, into the parlor, and the air\r\nfrom the parlor would flow out, through the upper part of the door-way,\r\ninto the entry. The water would settle down in the entry, until it was\r\nlevel in both rooms, and then the lower parts of both rooms would be\r\nfilled with water, and the upper parts with air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"And it is just so with warm and cold air. If the parlor is filled with\r\nwarm air, made so by the fire, and the entry with cold air, and you open\r\nthe door, then the cold air, being heavier, will sink down, and spread\r\nover the floor of both rooms; and the warm air, being light, will spread\r\naround over the upper parts of both rooms; and this will make a current\r\nof air, in at the bottom of the door-way, and out at the top.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued his mother, \"let me recapitulate what I have taught\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by _recapitulating_ it?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, tell you the substance of it, so that you can write it down\r\neasier.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I can write it now,\" said Rollo; \"I remember it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you remember it, Nathan?\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can remember some of it,\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\nSo Rollo and Nathan went out into another room, where Rollo kept his\r\ndesk, and they remained there half an hour. When they returned, they\r\nbrought their mother two papers.\r\n\r\nTheir mother opened the largest paper, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"We took a tuft of down, tied to a thread, and held it in the\r\n    cracks and places that the air came in at, to see which way it\r\n    went. We held it at the window, and it blew _in_ very strong. At\r\n    the bottom of the door, it blew _in_ very strong too; but at the\r\n    top, it blew _out_, into the entry. So, when the entry is full\r\n    of cold air, and this room full of warm, the cold air will press\r\n    in and drive out some of the warm air, into the entry.\r\n\r\n          ROLLO.\"\r\n\r\nThe other paper was also in Rollo's handwriting, and was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"If the entry was full of water, and the parlor full of air, and\r\n    the walls were water-tight, and you were to open the door\r\n    between the two rooms, the water would flow into the parlor down\r\n    below, and the air would flow into the entry up above. We tried\r\n    it with a tuft.\r\n\r\n          NATHAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    Why were Rollo and Nathan at first glad to see the rain? What\r\n    did their mother say to herself on the second day, when she\r\n    observed their weary and listless appearance? What did she at\r\n    first direct them to do? How did she prepare the downy tuft?\r\n    What experiments did they perform with it? Where did they find\r\n    that the air came in which crowded the warm air up the chimney?\r\n    What experiments did they perform when the door was opened?\r\n    Which way did they find that the current of air was setting at\r\n    the lower part of the door-way? Which way did the current set at\r\n    the upper part of the door-way? What did Rollo write in his\r\n    exercise? What was written in Nathan's exercise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBURNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the snow had all gone off, and the ground was dry, Jonas piled up\r\na heap of stumps, roots, and decayed logs, in a field, not far from the\r\nbrook, and one sunny afternoon he and Rollo went down to set the heaps\r\non fire.\r\n\r\nJonas set one on fire, and then he told Rollo that he might set another\r\non fire. After this, Jonas employed himself in gathering up sticks,\r\nbushes, roots, and other such things that lay scattered about the field,\r\nand putting them upon the fires, while Rollo amused himself in any way\r\nhe pleased.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, Rollo found, on the margin of the field, near the edge of\r\na wood, an old stump, taller than he was, much decayed. There was a hole\r\nin the top. Rollo climbed up so that he could put a stick in, and run it\r\ndown, to see how far down the hole extended. He found that it extended\r\ndown very near to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThen Rollo called out to Jonas, with a loud voice, saying,--\r\n\r\n\"Jonas, I have found a hollow stump here. It is hollow away down to the\r\nbottom. May I build a fire in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"if you can.\"\r\n\r\nRollo accordingly went to the nearest fire, and got a quantity of birch\r\nbark, which he had collected there to aid him in kindling his fires. He\r\nlighted one piece, and put it upon the end of a stick, and carried it to\r\nthe stump, with the rest of the birch bark in the other hand.\r\n\r\nRollo then spent some time in fruitless attempts to make some lighted\r\nbirch bark go down into the stump, and burn there. He succeeded very\r\nwell in getting pieces completely on fire; but, after they were dropped\r\ninto the hole, they would not burn. Rollo could not think what the\r\nreason could be.\r\n\r\nAt last he called Jonas to come and help him set the stump on fire.\r\n\r\nJonas said that he did not think that it could be set on fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'Jonas, I have found a hollow stump here,' said Rollo,\r\ncalling with a loud voice.\"--Page 122.]\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"it is so wet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but, Jonas,\" replied Rollo, \"your brush heaps burn, and why should\r\nnot this stump?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"the stump is more solid, and the water soaks\r\ninto it more in the winter and early in the spring; and it takes it much\r\nlonger to dry, than it does brush and small roots, which lie open and\r\nexposed to the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" replied Rollo, \"why does not my birch bark burn? that is\r\ndry; but as soon as I drop it down into the stump, it goes out.\"\r\n\r\nJonas looked into the stump, and down around the bottom of it, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Because there is no air.\"\r\n\r\n\"No air?\" repeated Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jonas; \"it is all close and solid around; the air cannot\r\nget in.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can get in at the top,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\nJonas made no reply to this remark, but walked away a few steps, to a\r\nplace where he had put down his axe; he took up the axe, and brought it\r\nto the stump. He immediately began to cut into it, at the bottom, as if\r\nit were a tree which he was going to fell.\r\n\r\n\"O Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"don't cut it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to cut it down,\" said Jonas; \"I am only going to cut a\r\nhole into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"To let the air in,\" replied Jonas.\r\n\r\nJonas continued to cut into the side of the stump, near the ground,\r\nuntil he perceived that the edge of his axe went through into the hollow\r\npart. Then he cleared away the chips a little, and showed Rollo that\r\nthere was an opening for the air.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I presume you will be able to make sticks and birch\r\nbark burn in the stump, though you can't make the stump itself burn very\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nRollo now dropped a blazing piece of birch bark into the stump, and, to\r\nhis great joy, he found that it continued blazing, after it reached the\r\nbottom. He then dropped in another piece upon it, which took fire. He\r\nthen gathered some dry sticks, and put in; and, finding that the flame\r\nwas increasing, he proceeded to gather all the dry and combustible\r\nmatter, which he could find around, and put them in, so that in a short\r\ntime he had a fine blaze, a foot above the top of the stump; and the\r\ninside of the stump itself seemed to be in flames.\r\n\r\n\"Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"it does burn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it?\" said Jonas; \"I am glad to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said the stump would not burn.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to wait until it is all burnt up, before you triumph over\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"I didn't mean to triumph over you; but why\r\nwould not the fire burn before you cut the hole through?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied Jonas, \"there was not air enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was air in the stump,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas, \"but all the life of it was consumed by the first\r\npiece of birch bark which you put in.\"\r\n\r\n\"The life of it?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas; \"what do you suppose it is, that makes anything\r\nburn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it burns itself,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Jonas; \"the air makes it burn: it must have good air\r\naround it, or else it won't burn. There is something in the air which I\r\ncall the life of it; this makes the fire burn. But when this is all\r\ngone, then that air will not make fire burn any longer. It will only\r\nburn in good fresh air, which has got the life in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought fire would burn in any kind of air,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jonas; \"you can see if you stop up the hole I made here.\"\r\n\r\nJonas then took a piece of turf from the field, and put it before the\r\nhole, and crowded it in hard with the heel of his boot. Rollo observed\r\nthat the fire was almost immediately deadened.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Jonas, \"light a small piece of birch bark, and put it\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nJonas helped Rollo fasten a small piece of bark upon the end of a stick,\r\nand then Rollo set it on fire, and held it down a little way into the\r\nstump. It burned very feebly.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said Jonas, \"how quick it is stifled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Rollo, \"it goes out almost directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Jonas, \"that the fire already in the stump consumes all\r\nthe goodness of the air; and I stopped up the hole, so that no fresh air\r\ncan come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why doesn't it go in at the top?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"It does a little,\" said Jonas, \"but not much, because the hollow of the\r\nstump is already full of bad air, and there is nothing to make a\r\ncurrent. When there is an opening below, then there is a current up\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it is just like a chimney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas, \"the stump is the chimney, and the hole is the\r\nfireplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the air in the stump,\" said Rollo, \"gets hot, and so the cold air\r\nall around is heavier, and so it crowds down under it, and buoys the hot\r\nair up out of the stump. My father explained it all to Nathan and me.\"\r\n\r\nRollo then wanted to open the hole again, to see if the effect would be\r\nas he had described.\r\n\r\nThen Jonas pulled away the turf from the hole at the bottom of the\r\nstump, and Rollo observed that the fire brightened up immediately.\r\n\r\nHe then held a smoking brand near the hole, and he saw that the smoke\r\nwas carried in, in a very strong current, by the cool air, which was\r\npressing into the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it operates just like a fireplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" continued Jonas, \"that whenever you build a fire, you must\r\nsee to it, that there is an opening for air to come up from underneath\r\nit. And it must be good fresh air too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it in the air, which makes the fire burn?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what the name of it is,\" said Jonas; \"it is some part of\r\nthe air, which goes into the fire, and is all consumed, and then the\r\nrest of the air is good for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it good for anything at all?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Jonas, \"how that is; only I know that it isn't good\r\nfor anything for fires. It stifles them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know what the name of that part of the air is, which\r\nis good for fires,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I knew once,\" said Jonas, \"but it was a hard word, and I have forgotten\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to ask my father,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\nJonas then went on with his work, gathering up everything that he could\r\nfind around the field, to put upon the fires. Rollo amused himself by\r\nputting large rolls of birch bark around the end of a stick, and then,\r\nafter setting them on fire, holding them over the fires, which Jonas was\r\nmaking, to see how soon the flame was extinguished: then he would draw\r\nthem away, and see them revive and blaze up again in the open air. At\r\nlast, he called out to Jonas, once more.\r\n\r\n\"Jonas,\" said he, \"I have found out what makes the blaze go out. It is\r\nthe smoke. I don't believe but that it is the smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jonas, \"it is not the smoke. I can prove that it is not.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jonas came up to the fire where Rollo was standing, and pointed out\r\nto Rollo a place, over a hot part of it, where there was no smoke,\r\nbecause the fire under it burned clear, being nearly reduced to coals.\r\nHe told Rollo to hold his blazing bark there. Rollo did so, and found\r\nthat it was extinguished at once, and as completely, as it had been\r\nbefore, when he had held it in a dense smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it isn't the smoke. But perhaps it is because it is\r\nso hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas, \"it isn't that. It is a difference in the air. They\r\nsometimes collect different kinds of air in glass jars, and then let a\r\ncandle down in, and see whether it will go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will it go out?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon what kind of air it is,\" said Jonas. \"They all look\r\nclear, just as if there was nothing in the jars; but when you let a\r\ncandle down in, in some it burns just the same as before; in some it\r\nburns brighter; and in some it goes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what kinds does it go out?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I only know of one kind,\" said Jonas, \"and that is a kind that comes of\r\nitself in mines, and wells, and other places.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of it?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the people in the mines call it choke damp; but I believe it has\r\ngot another name besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they call it choke damp for?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"if the miners get into it and breathe it, it\r\nkills them. It is not any better to breathe than it is to make fires\r\nburn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could see some choke damp,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"O, you can't see it at all,\" said Jonas, \"if it was right before you,\r\nany more than you can see common air. If a well or a mine is full of it,\r\nthey cannot find it out by looking down.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do they find it out?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they let a candle down,\" replied Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"And will the candle go out?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"if there is choke damp in the well. Sometimes they\r\nmake a little of it in a tumbler or a jar upon the table, and so let a\r\nlittle flame down into it, and it goes out immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could make some,\" said Rollo. \"Do you know how they make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas; \"but I believe it is pretty easy to do it, if we only\r\nknew how.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will ask my father,\" said Rollo; \"perhaps he will know.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place when Jonas and Rollo were about the fires;\r\nbut now the fires had pretty nearly burnt out, and they prepared to go\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThat evening, just about sunset, Rollo went out behind the house, and\r\nfound Jonas raking off the yard. The spring was fast coming on, and the\r\ngrass was beginning to look a little green; and Jonas said he wanted to\r\nget off all the sticks, chips, and straws, so that the yard would\r\npresent a surface of smooth and uniform green. Rollo told him that he\r\nhad found out how to make choke damp.\r\n\r\n\"Did your father tell you?\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Who did tell you, then?\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Guess,\" answered Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Your mother,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Then I can't tell,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"It was Miss Mary,\" replied Rollo. \"I met her in the road to-day, and I\r\nasked her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how is it?\" asked Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we make it with chalk and vinegar,\" said Rollo. \"We pound up a\r\nlittle chalk, and put it in the bottom of a tumbler. Then we pour some\r\nvinegar over it. The vinegar takes the choke damp out of the chalk, and\r\nMiss Mary says it will come up in little bubbles. She says we can lay a\r\npaper over the top loosely,--she said loosely, but I think it ought to\r\nbe tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"So as to keep the choke damp from coming out,\" replied Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas. \"I understand why she said you must put it on loosely;\r\nthat's to let the common air out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What common air?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the air that was in the tumbler before,\" replied Jonas. \"You see\r\nthat, as fast as the choke damp comes up, it drives the common air out\r\nof the top of the tumbler; and so you must put the paper on loosely, and\r\nlet it go out.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening Jonas and Rollo tried the experiment. First they put about\r\ntwo teaspoonfuls of chalk into the tumbler. Then they poured in the\r\nvinegar. It immediately began to foam.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Rollo, \"that's the effervescence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" said Dorothy; for they were making this experiment upon the\r\nkitchen table, and Dorothy was standing by, looking on with great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"The _effervescence_,\" said Rollo. \"Miss Mary said there would be an\r\neffervescence, which would be occasioned by the little bubbles of choke\r\ndamp, coming up from the chalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poh!\" said Dorothy; \"it's nothing but a little frothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't frothing,\" said Rollo, very seriously; \"it isn't frothing, it\r\nis effervescence. Don't you think Miss Mary knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jonas,\" said Rollo again after a short pause, \"how many of these little\r\nbubbles will it take, do you think, to fill the tumbler full of choke\r\ndamp?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jonas; \"we will wait a little while, and then\r\ntry it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, now, Jonas,\" said Rollo, \"we have not got any candle.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I will roll up a piece of paper, and set the end on fire, and then\r\ndip it down into the tumbler, and that will do just as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do that for?\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to see it go out,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"It won't go out, unless you put it away down into the vinegar,\" said\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes it will,\" said Rollo; \"we are only going to dip it down a little\r\nway, just into the choke damp, and it will go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't go out, child,\" said Dorothy. \"There's nothing to put it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'll see. Won't it go out, Jonas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know?\" said Rollo. \"Why, you told me that choke damp would put\r\nout a blaze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"I am sure of that; but there are a great many ways\r\nof failing in trying experiments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Rollo, \"that may be; but this will not fail, I know, for I\r\ncan see the little bubbles of choke damp coming up. There are millions\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Jonas thought that the tumbler was filled with the gas,\r\nwhich was rising from the chalk and vinegar. So he rolled up a piece of\r\npaper, and set the end on fire, and, when it was well burning, he\r\nplunged the end of it into the tumbler. To Rollo's great disappointment\r\nand mortification, it continued to burn about as much as ever. The flame\r\ncrept rapidly up the paper, and Jonas had soon to run with it across the\r\nfloor and throw it into the fire, to avoid burning his fingers. Dorothy\r\nlaughed aloud; Jonas smiled; and as for Rollo, he looked disappointed\r\nand vexed, and appeared to be overwhelmed with chagrin.\r\n\r\nDorothy continued to laugh at them, while Jonas went to the pump and\r\nwashed out the tumbler. At length she said,--\r\n\r\n\"But come, Rollo, don't be so disconsolate. You look as if you had\r\nswallowed all the choke damp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Rollo,\" said Jonas, \"we must keep good-natured, even if our\r\nexperiments do fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I mean to ask Miss Mary again, and then we can do\r\nit, I know.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRollo accordingly went, the next day, to ask Miss Mary about the cause\r\nof the failure. Miss Mary said that she could not think of any thing\r\nwhich was likely to be the cause, unless it was that they put too large\r\na flame into the tumbler.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Rollo, \"and what harm would that do? Won't the choke\r\ndamp put out a large flame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Miss Mary, \"if it only fairly surrounds and covers it;\r\nbut, then, if you put a large flame into a tumbler, it makes the first\r\ninstant, a great current of air, and so the choke damp might be blown\r\nout, and common air get in, and so keep the paper burning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it make a current of air?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the heat of the flame, when you first put the paper in,\" replied\r\nMiss Mary, \"makes the air that is above it lighter; and the common air\r\nall around crowds in under it, in buoying it up; and by that means, if\r\nthe flame is too large, common air is carried into the tumbler. You\r\nought to make a very small flame, if you leave the top of the tumbler\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we make a small flame?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"One good way,\" replied Miss Mary, \"is to roll up some paper into a very\r\nsmall roll. I will show you how.\"\r\n\r\nSo Miss Mary took a piece of paper, and cut it into the proper shape\r\nwith her scissors, and then rolled it up into a long and very slender\r\nroll; one end of it was not much larger than a large knitting-needle.\r\nShe gave this to Rollo, and told him that, if he tried the experiment\r\nagain, he must light the small end, and it would make a flame not so\r\nbig as a pea.\r\n\r\nRollo explained to Jonas what Miss Mary had said, and they resolved on\r\nattempting the experiment again that evening. And they did so. Dorothy\r\nstood by watching the process, as she had done the evening before, but\r\nRollo did not assert so confidently and positively what the result would\r\nbe. He had learned moderation by the experience of the night before.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Jonas lighted the end of the slender roll in the\r\nlamp, and plunged it carefully into the tumbler. It went out\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Rollo, clapping his hands, \"it goes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is only because the wind blew it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Dorothy,\" said Rollo, \"there isn't any wind in the tumbler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Dorothy, \"when you push it down, it makes a little wind,\r\njust enough to blow it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get another tumbler,\" said Jonas, \"and let us see.\"\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy brought another tumbler, and Jonas put the burning end of\r\nthe paper down into it, with about as rapid a motion as that with which\r\nhe had put it before into the tumbler he had at first. The paper\r\ncontinued to burn.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said he to Dorothy, \"when I put it down into common air, it\r\nburns on the same as ever; so it can't be that the wind puts it out.\"\r\nJonas repeated the experiment a number of times; the effect was always\r\nthe same. Whenever he put it into the tumbler of common air, it burned\r\non without any change; but whenever he put it into the choke damp, it\r\nimmediately went out. Even Dorothy was satisfied that there was a\r\ndifference in the kind of air contained in the two tumblers.\r\n\r\nThat evening, when Rollo gave his mother a full account of their\r\nattempts,--describing particularly their failure at first, and their\r\nsubsequent successes,--his mother seemed much interested. When he had\r\nfinished, she said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Rollo, I don't see but that you have learned two lessons in\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two lessons?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his mother. \"The first is, that fire will not burn in\r\nchoke damp; and the second is, that it requires nice attention and care\r\nto verify philosophical truths by experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"we missed the first time, just because we had too\r\nbig a paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    Why did Jonas suppose that the stump would not burn? What was\r\n    Rollo's first mode of setting it on fire? How did it succeed?\r\n    What did Jonas do with his axe, when he came? What was the\r\n    object of this? What did he say was necessary to make fires\r\n    burn? What did Rollo at first think was the reason why the bark\r\n    went out when held over the fire? What did he next think was the\r\n    reason? How did Jonas say that different kinds of airs were\r\n    prepared? In what places did he say that choke damp was\r\n    naturally produced? How did they attempt to prepare some of this\r\n    gas? Did they succeed in preparing it? Did they succeed in their\r\n    experiment at first? What was the cause of the failure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGRAVITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, after tea, when Rollo was a pretty big boy, he came and\r\nbegan to climb up into his father's lap. When he had climbed up, he took\r\nhis place astride of his father's knee, as if he were riding a horse.\r\nHis little brother Nathan came up and stood near, wanting to get up too,\r\nonly there was not room. His cousin James was there, that evening, on a\r\nvisit. He sat upon a cricket before the fire, and his mother was at the\r\ntable doing some sort of work.\r\n\r\n\"O dear me!\" said Rollo's father, imitating the tone in which Rollo\r\nsometimes uttered that exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"What, sir?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I should like very well to hold you in my lap,\" said his father,\r\n\"if it was not for the great mighty earth, down below us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Rollo. He did not know what his father meant.\r\n\r\n\"Why, when you are upon my knee, the earth, the ponderous earth, pulls\r\nyou down hard and heavy upon it.\" So saying, he put his hands upon\r\nRollo's shoulders, and crowded them down, by way of showing him how the\r\nearth acted upon him. \"It pulls,\" he continued, \"with a strong and\r\nsteady pull, all the time; and so makes you a very heavy weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what makes weight?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father. \"So, if I had a monstrous stone to move, and if\r\nI thought the earth would listen to me, and let go its hold, I might\r\nmake a speech to it thus:--\r\n\r\n\"'O earth, thou vast and ponderous ball, please to relax thy hold, for a\r\nfew minutes, upon this stone, and leave it free to move; and then Rollo\r\ncan tie a string to it, and move it easily along to the place where I\r\nwant it to lie; then thou mayst seize it again with thy mighty\r\nattraction, and hold it down as firmly as thou wilt.'\"\r\n\r\n\"O father!\" exclaimed Rollo; Nathan and James laughed, and Rollo's\r\nmother looked up from her work to listen to this strange apostrophe.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem,\" continued his father, in a pompous tone, as if still\r\naddressing the earth--\"it would seem, most mighty planet, a very easy\r\nthing for thee to release this single stone, for a few minutes, from the\r\ngrasp with which thou holdest all things down upon thy surface. And by\r\nit I shall gain much, while thou wilt lose nothing; for, if thou wilt\r\nnot willingly give up the stone, I must get three or four yoke of strong\r\noxen, and, by main force, pull it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what makes everything heavy?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, answering now in his natural tone; \"the\r\nattraction of the earth is what makes everything heavy, and holds it\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And could we move a monstrous great stone,\" said Rollo, \"as light as a\r\nfeather?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, \"it would not move along quick and light, like a\r\nfeather. You could not move it quick. Suppose, for instance, you had two\r\nboats, floating upon the water, of the same size; one made very light\r\nindeed, of something very thin, like paper, and empty; and the other\r\nmade of wood, and loaded with iron as heavily as it would bear. Now,\r\nthey would both be supported upon the water, so that their weight would\r\nbe neutralized; and yet they would move very differently. You could push\r\nthe light one about easily, anywhere, but the heavy one would move very\r\nslowly. You would not have to push very hard upon it, but you would have\r\nto push _for some time_, to set it in motion; and then it would be hard\r\nto stop it. This is called its _inertia_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it would go harder against the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason is,\" continued his father, \"that the heavy boat contains a\r\ngreat many more particles of matter than the light one, and they have\r\nall got to be put in motion. So it requires greater effort, or the same\r\neffort must be continued a longer time.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, if we suppose that the light boat has one million of\r\nparticles of matter, the heavy one would have, perhaps, twenty millions.\r\nOf course the effect of the pushing has to be divided among twenty times\r\nas many particles, and of course will only carry them one twentieth part\r\nas far; so that the bodies that are now large and heavy, would only move\r\nslowly, though they would move _easily_, if the attraction of the earth\r\nwere to cease.\r\n\r\n\"There is another way to illustrate it,\" he continued. \"Suppose there\r\nwas a large mass of lead, as big as a load of hay, hanging by a chain;\r\nand also a great puff of feathers, or a balloon of the same size,\r\nhanging in the same way. Now, if they were both suspended freely, they\r\nwould both move easily, for their weight would be supported by the\r\nchain; but the heavy one would move very slowly. Nathan could move it,\r\nbut he could only move it slowly and a little way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not think that he could move it but very little,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No, he could not; because you see that, in that way of suspending\r\nanything, the moment that it begins to move, it begins to swing off and\r\nto rise; so that it cannot be moved at all without being _lifted_ a\r\nlittle. And the more it is moved, the higher it is lifted, so that it\r\nwould take a great force to move it far away from the centre, where it\r\nwas hanging. But we can hang it in a way to avoid that difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, sir?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\nRollo seemed to be very much interested in this conversation. He had\r\ndismounted from his father's knee, and stood by his side, listening\r\neagerly. His mother, too, was paying close attention. As for Nathan, he\r\nsat still; though it is not by any means certain that he understood it\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose,\" said his father, \"that the mass of lead, as big as a\r\nload of hay, is fastened to one end of a stick of timber.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would not be strong enough to hold it,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to a beam of iron, as large as a stick of timber,\" rejoined\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said James, \"you could not get such a big bar of iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his father, \"only an imaginary one; and that will be just\r\nas good as any. Now, suppose the great mass of lead is fastened to one\r\nend of this bar, and another one, just like it, to the other end, to\r\nbalance it. Now, suppose that the lower end of the great chain is\r\nsecured around the middle of the iron beam, and the upper end to be\r\nfastened to some strong support up in the air. Now, we can move the mass\r\nof lead without having to lift it at all; for, if we push against it,\r\nand make it move, it will move round and round, without rising at all,\r\nas it did before, when it was hung up directly by the chain.\"\r\n\r\nRollo's father then went on to explain to them that, in such a case as\r\nthis, the weight of the two masses of lead would not prevent their\r\nmoving easily, for they would exactly balance each other. A little child\r\nwould be able to move them; but still they would move exceedingly slow\r\nat first, and it would be hard to stop them, when they were in motion.\r\nSo, he said, if the earth should cease to attract and draw down any\r\ngreat, heavy body, like a large stone, for example, the smallest child\r\ncould lift it, though it would come up slowly, just as a very heavy body\r\nwould move, if it was suspended by a string, or was afloat upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" said Rollo, \"if the earth should not attract us, could we push\r\nourselves right up off from the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"most undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, and go about anywhere in the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nRollo began to laugh aloud at this idea, and looked very much interested\r\nand pleased.\r\n\r\n\"O, then I wish there was no gravitation,\" said Rollo; \"I do, really.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, then,\" continued his father, \"if you should get up into the air,\r\nyou could not get down again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Nathan, beginning to look a little concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" said his father, \"you had something above you, to push\r\nagainst, so as to push yourselves down. You would be just like a boy in\r\na boat, off from the shore, and without any paddle or pole. He could not\r\nget back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might tie a rope to something,\" said James, \"before we went up, and\r\nso pull ourselves down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that you might do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And could not we flap our hands, like a bird, and so fly a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you could,\" said his father.\r\n\r\nHere the children all began to flap their hands, like young birds trying\r\nto fly; and Rollo said again, he wished, with all his heart, there was\r\nno gravitation; \"for then,\" said he, \"we should have strength enough to\r\nfly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would lead to serious consequences,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"What consequences?\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"Much more serious than you would suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us what they would be, uncle,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"O, I know,\" said Rollo; \"you could not stand up straight without\r\ngravitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we could, couldn't we, father?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think, Rollo,\" said his father, without replying to\r\nJames's question--\"what makes you think that we could not stand up\r\nstraight without gravitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see,\" said Rollo.--Here he paused, and looked confused, and\r\ndid not know what to say. He had an indistinct recollection of having\r\nread something about it in some book; but he could not tell what.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what should prevent any body's standing up straight, if the\r\nattraction of the earth should cease; in fact, if it made any\r\ndifference, it would be rather easier to stand up straight.\"\r\n\r\nHere Rollo looked rather foolish, but he did not reply. The truth is,\r\nlike almost all other children, who take an interest in reading, he was\r\nsometimes a little vain of his knowledge; and in this case, instead of\r\nlistening attentively, and endeavoring to learn something new from his\r\nfather's explanations, he seems to have thought it a good plan for him\r\nto help him elucidate the subject to James and Nathan. He exchanged the\r\ncharacter of learner for teacher too soon.\r\n\r\n\"Well, uncle,\" said James, \"what would be the consequence if gravitation\r\nshould cease?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the first place,\" said Rollo's father, \"all the streams in the\r\nworld would stop running.\"\r\n\r\n\"The streams!\" said Rollo, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"every river, brook, and rill. The reason why\r\nthe streams flow is, that the earth attracts the water from the\r\nmountains and hills, down into the valleys and towards the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, what else?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there would never be any more rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more rain!\" exclaimed all the children.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied. \"The drops of rain fall only because the earth draws\r\nthem down by its attraction; and, of course, if this attraction should\r\ncease, they would remain where they are.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were musing a minute upon these strange effects, when Rollo\r\nasked if anything else would happen.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said his father, \"worse disasters than these; but I do not\r\nknow whether you would understand them, if I should explain them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, try,\" said Rollo; \"I think we shall understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me think,\" said his father. \"You have noticed how a chaise\r\nwheel, on a muddy road, in a wet day, holds the mud upon it, until when\r\nit is going very swiftly down a hill, and then the mud flies off in all\r\ndirections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said all the children.\r\n\r\n\"And if the mud did not stick to the wheel pretty tight, it would be\r\nthrown off at all times, even when the wheel was going slow. You\r\nunderstand this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, this whole earth, you all know, is whirling around\r\nthrough space, and moving on also around the sun. And all the loose\r\nthings upon the surface would be thrown off at once, if they were\r\nnot held to it by a strong attraction. If this attraction were to\r\ncease suddenly,--whisk!--away we should all go in an instant--rocks,\r\nhouses, men, animals, all in confusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"O father!\" exclaimed Rollo; \"where should we go to,--off into the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly into the air, for the air would all fly off, and be\r\ndissipated too; we should fly off into the sky somewhere, some in one\r\ndirection, and some in another. You'd be a thousand miles off from the\r\nearth, almost before you would know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it kill us, father?\" said Nathan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father. \"I don't know that there would be any shock that\r\nwould hurt us, but we should have no air to breathe, and it would be\r\ndark and dismal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark?\" said Rollo. \"There would be the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"there would be the sun; and the sun would look\r\nbright enough when you looked directly towards it, but there would be no\r\ngeneral light about you, unless there was air.\"\r\n\r\nThe children all paused to reflect upon the strange results which their\r\nfather had told them would ensue from a suspension of the earth's\r\nattractive force. Rollo began to think that he had been too hasty in his\r\nwish that there was no gravitation.\r\n\r\n\"But, father,\" said he, \"the houses would not go off, certainly;--only\r\nthe loose things would go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; houses are loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"O father! they are fastened down.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are they fastened down?\" asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"O, they are nailed--and,\"\r\n\r\n\"Not nailed to the ground, certainly,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Rollo, laughing; \"but then they are built with great stones\r\nand mortar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but there is no mortar under the lowest stones. The foundations\r\nare simply laid upon the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" rejoined Rollo, \"I thought they were fastened somehow or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father; \"they dig the cellar, and only just lay the\r\nfoundations upon the ground, without any fastening. The earth holds them\r\nin place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father,\" said Rollo, \"that is what I meant, when I said we could\r\nnot stand up straight. I meant the houses. I read in a book that houses\r\nwould be blown away, if the gravitation did not hold them down.\"\r\n\r\nHere Rollo's father had a hearty laugh; and he told Rollo that he\r\nthought that was rather wide shooting. Rollo wanted to know what he was\r\nlaughing at; and Nathan asked him what he meant by wide shooting.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, \"Rollo, you undertook to explain to us, from your stores\r\nof knowledge, what the effects of a suspension of gravitation would be;\r\nand, in attempting to tell that houses would be in danger of being blown\r\naway, you came no nearer than to tell us that boys could not stand up\r\nstraight; and that is what I call pretty wide shooting.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he rose from his seat, and walked away, appearing to be very\r\nmuch amused. James laughed too, and even Rollo could not help smiling at\r\nthe ridiculous figure which his display of his learning made. As for\r\nNathan, he continued to look grave; and said he did not see that it was\r\nany shooting at all.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, Rollo's mother said, \"So you see, children, the\r\ncause of all the pressure, both of air and of water, and all the effects\r\nproduced by them, are the results of their gravitation towards the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I believe I understand it now.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, Rollo took James and Nathan out into the yard, to see if\r\nsome beans had come up, which he had been planting in a sunny corner of\r\nthe garden the day before.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What was Mr. Holiday's apostrophe to the earth? What is the\r\n    cause of weight? Why did the boys wish that there was no\r\n    gravitation? What was the first evil consequence which their\r\n    father said would ensue, if there was no gravitation? What was\r\n    the second evil consequence? What did their mother say after the\r\n    conversation with their father was closed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAIR IN MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRollo's dam, which he had made when he was studying the philosophy of\r\nwater, and which was at first undermined by the pressure of the water,\r\nwas afterwards carried away by its momentum. Rollo learned, at that\r\ntime, that water moving rapidly had a great momentum; and about this\r\ntime he had an opportunity of learning that air, when in motion, had a\r\nmomentum too, capable of producing very powerful effects. The\r\ncircumstances of the case were as follows:--\r\n\r\nOne morning, towards the latter part of March, Jonas, being out in the\r\nbarn, observed some indications that the roof wanted repairs. It had\r\nbeen strained and weakened by the heavy snows in the winter. He reported\r\nthe fact to Rollo's father, who said that he might go, the next day, and\r\nget the carpenter to come and repair it. The carpenter lived ten miles\r\ndistant, near the shore of a long pond.\r\n\r\nWhen Rollo heard of this proposed expedition, he wanted to go too; and\r\nhis father gave him permission. Jonas was going in the wagon. He told\r\nRollo, the evening before, that he meant to set out at six o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose it looks like a storm,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Then there will be more need of going,\" said Jonas; \"for if the\r\nequinoctial storm comes on before the roof is strengthened, it may get\r\ncarried away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the equinoctial storm?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"O, it is a great storm, which comes generally about this time of year.\r\nI shouldn't wonder if it should come on to-morrow. But it may not come\r\nfor a week; and so I hope we shall have time to get the roof mended\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it look like a storm to-night?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No, not much,\" replied Jonas. \"It is a little hazy in the south-west.\r\nHowever, if it looks like a storm in the morning, you need not go,\r\nunless you choose; though I shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd wait till the storm is over,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas, \"I had rather go in the storm than not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jonas, \"I like to be out in storms. Sometimes it is very\r\ngrand.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Rollo awoke, he found that it was light, but not\r\nyet sunrise. He arose, and looked out of the window to see if it was\r\npleasant. The sky was somewhat overcast, but there was a little blue to\r\nbe seen, and Rollo thought that it would be pleasant. He heard a noise\r\nin the barn-yard, and, looking in that direction, he saw Jonas just\r\nleading the horse out of the stable. So he dressed himself soon, and\r\nwent down.\r\n\r\nWhen he got ready, he went down into the yard, and found that Jonas had\r\ngot the horse harnessed, and everything prepared. There was a little bag\r\nof oats in the back part of the wagon, and also a tin pail, with a\r\ncover, which contained a luncheon. Jonas fastened the horse to a post,\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Rollo, we'll go in and get some breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that luncheon was for breakfast,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas, \"that is for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we be gone all the day?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"We may be gone till after dinner,\" said Jonas, \"and so I thought I\r\nwould be sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe two boys went into the house, and there they found that Dorothy had\r\ngot some breakfast ready for them upon the kitchen table. After eating\r\ntheir breakfast, they got into the wagon, and set out. Jonas first put\r\nin a large umbrella. Just as they were driving out of the yard, the\r\nfirst beams of the morning sun shone in under the branches of a great\r\ntree in the yard, and brightened up the tips of the horses' ears and the\r\nboys' faces. At the same time, a rude gust of wind came around the\r\ncorners of the house, and slammed to the gate of the front yard.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be pleasant,\" said Rollo; \"the sun is coming out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not very sure of that,\" said Jonas; \"the wind is rising.\"\r\n\r\n\"We start just at sunrise,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jonas, \"the sun always rises at six o'clock at this time\r\nof the year.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys rode along for about three hours, before they came to the\r\ncarpenter's. They were obliged to travel very slow, for the roads were\r\nnot good. It is true that the snow was all gone, and the frost was\r\nnearly out of the ground; but there were many deep ruts, and in some\r\nplaces it was muddy. The sun went into a cloud soon after they set out,\r\nand it continued overcast all the morning. There was some wind too, but,\r\nas it was behind them, and as the road lay through woods and among\r\nsheltered hills, they did not observe it much. Jonas said that there was\r\na storm coming on, but he thought it was coming slowly.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at length at the pond. There was a little village there,\r\nupon the shore of the pond. The reason why there happened to be a\r\nvillage there, was this: A stream of water, which came down from among\r\nthe mountains, emptied into the pond here, and, very near where it\r\nemptied, it fell over a ledge of rocks, making a waterfall, where the\r\npeople had built some mills. Now, where there are mills, there must\r\ngenerally be a blacksmith's shop, to mend the iron work when it gets\r\nbroken, and to repair tools. There is often a tavern, also, for the\r\npeople who come to the mills; and then there is generally a store or\r\ntwo; for wherever people have to come together, for any business, there\r\nis a good place to open a store, to sell them what they want to buy.\r\nThus there was a little village about these mills, which was generally\r\ncalled the Mill village.\r\n\r\nJonas inquired where the carpenter lived, and then drove directly to his\r\nhouse. He found that he was not at home. He had gone across the pond, to\r\nmend a bridge, which had been in part carried away by the floods made\r\nwhen the snow went off. Rollo sat in the wagon in the yard by the side\r\nof the carpenter's house, while Jonas stood at the door, making\r\ninquiries and getting this information.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to see him very much,\" said the carpenter's wife, \"I\r\npresume you can get a boat down in the village, and go across the pond.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is he from the other side of the pond?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, close by the upper landing,\" said she; \"not a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the shore, right up the road.\"\r\n\r\nJonas thanked the woman for her information, and got into the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"Let us get a boat and go over, Jonas,\" said Rollo, as they were turning\r\nthe wagon round.\r\n\r\n\"I should,\" said Jonas, \"if there was not such a threatening of a\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not blow much,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas, \"not much now, but the wind may rise before we get\r\nback. However, we'll go and see if we can get a boat.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some inquiry, they found a boat, at a little distance out of the\r\nvillage, in a sort of cove, where there was a fine, sandy beach. The\r\nboat was of very good size, and it had in it two oars and a paddle.\r\nJonas looked out upon the water, and up to the sky, and he listened to\r\nhear the moaning of the wind upon the tops of the trees. He wanted very\r\nmuch to persevere in his effort to find the carpenter; but then, on the\r\nother hand, he was not sure that it was quite safe to take Rollo out\r\nupon the water at such a time. He sat upon a log upon the shore a few\r\nminutes, and seemed lost in thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"And very soon they were gliding smoothly along out of\r\nthe cove.\"--Page 167.]\r\n\r\nAt last he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Rollo, I believe we'll go. The worst that will happen will be,\r\nthat you may get frightened a little. We can't get hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we get hurt?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, even if it comes on to blow hard, it will probably be a steady\r\ngale, and I can run before it, if I can't do anything else. And there\r\ncan't be much of a sea in this pond.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did not know what Jonas meant by much of a sea in the pond; but,\r\nas Jonas immediately went to work taking the horse out of the wagon,\r\nRollo did not ask any questions. The boys unharnessed the horse, for\r\nJonas said he would stand easier out of harness, and they might be gone\r\nmore than an hour. They fastened him then to a tree, and poured the oats\r\ndown before him upon the ground. Then Jonas helped Rollo into the boat,\r\nand put in the tin pail containing their luncheon, and also the\r\numbrella; though he said he did not think it would rain before they got\r\nback. Then he shoved off the boat, and jumped in himself; and very soon\r\nthey were gliding smoothly along out of the cove.\r\n\r\nRollo wanted to row; and so Jonas let him take one oar, while he himself\r\nsat in the stern with the paddle. Rollo soon learned the proper motion,\r\nso that his efforts assisted considerably in propelling the boat. They\r\nfound, when they were out at a little distance upon the water, that the\r\nwind blew much harder than Rollo had expected.\r\n\r\n\"Jonas,\" said he, \"the wind blows more here than it did upon the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jonas, \"only we feel it more here than when we were under the\r\nlee of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by the lee of the land?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I mean the shelter of it,\" replied Jonas. \"Whenever a ship at sea is\r\nsheltered by anything, they say the ship is under its lee.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys went on, Rollo rowing, and Jonas paddling behind, until at\r\nlength Rollo got tired. Jonas then told him to spread the umbrella, and\r\nhold it up for a sail. Rollo did so. The wind was blowing pretty nearly\r\nin the direction in which they were going, and, by its impulse upon the\r\numbrella, it caused it to pull very hard. Rollo rested the middle of the\r\nhandle of the umbrella upon his shoulder, holding the crook in his hand,\r\nturning it in such a position as to present the open part of the\r\numbrella fairly to the wind. Jonas continued to paddle, and so they went\r\non very prosperously until they had got two thirds across the pond, when\r\nJonas ordered Rollo to take in sail.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Rollo, \"we have not got across yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jonas, \"but the wind is taking us out of our course.\"\r\n\r\nRollo drew down the umbrella, and looked around. They were still at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the shore. Jonas extended his paddle out into\r\nthe water as far as he could reach, and then drew it in towards him with\r\nseveral quick and strong strokes, as if he were endeavoring to pull the\r\nstern of the boat, in which he was sitting, round.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing so for?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I am trying to bring her up into the wind,\" replied Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"What is that for?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we've drifted to leeward,\" said Jonas, \"and I must bring her\r\n_up_; for we want to land around behind that point on the starboard\r\nbow.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did not understand Jonas's technical language very well. He\r\nparticularly did not know what Jonas meant by bringing her _up_, for it\r\nseemed to him that the pond was perfectly level, so that there was no up\r\nor down either way. He did not know that, in sea language, _against_ the\r\nwind was always _up_, and _with_ the wind, _down_.\r\n\r\nJonas found it hard to bring the boat up into the wind. The waves had\r\nbegun to be pretty large, and they beat against the bows of the boat,\r\nand some of the water dashed over upon Rollo. The wind blew quite\r\nheavily, too; and now that they had changed their direction so as to\r\nbring the wind upon their side, it embarrassed, if it did not absolutely\r\nretard their progress. Some drops of rain also began to fall.\r\n\r\nHowever, by hard and persevering exertion, Jonas at length succeeded in\r\nurging the boat forward until he began to draw nigh to the point of\r\nland; and soon afterwards they came under the shelter of it, where the\r\nwater was smooth, and the air comparatively still. Here Rollo put in\r\nhis oar again, and they passed along close under a high shore, for some\r\ndistance, until they came to the landing. Here they fastened the boat,\r\nand then began to walk along up the road.\r\n\r\nThe road lay through the woods, and among hills, so that it was\r\nsheltered; and the only indications of the wind which the boys noticed,\r\nwas a distant roaring sound among the forests. They came at length to\r\nthe bridge, where they found several workmen busily engaged in laying\r\nabutments of stone, but the carpenter himself was not there. The men\r\ntold Jonas that he had gone about half a mile away, on a by-road, to\r\nselect and cut some timber to be used in the construction of the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"How long will he be gone?\" asked Jonas.\r\n\r\n\"He will be gone two or three hours,\" said a man with a stone hammer in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Rollo, addressing Jonas, after a short\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\"Keep on until we find him,\" replied Jonas. \"But you may stay here and\r\nsee them build the bridge, while I go after the carpenter.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Jonas went on, leaving Rollo seated upon a bank watching the\r\nwork. In about three quarters of an hour, he returned; and then he and\r\nRollo went back to the boat. The wind had all this time continued to\r\nincrease, though they were so much sheltered, that they did not notice\r\nit much.\r\n\r\nJonas, however, observed that some light, scudding clouds were flying\r\nacross the sky, very low, being apparently far beneath the other clouds.\r\nWhen they reached the boat, Rollo proposed that they should stop and eat\r\nsome luncheon; but Jonas said that he should eat his with a better\r\nappetite on the other side of the pond. So he hastened Rollo into the\r\nboat, and, talking his station in the stern, he began to ply his paddle\r\nwith all his force, running the boat along under the shelter of the high\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't much wind, Jonas,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"We can tell better when we come round the point,\" replied Jonas.\r\n\r\nRollo observed that Jonas looked a little anxious, and he also seemed to\r\nbe exerting himself so much in the long, steady strokes of his paddle,\r\nthat it appeared to be rather an interruption to him to hear and answer\r\nquestions. Rollo therefore did not talk. He found, however, as he drew\r\nnear the point, that the waves were running by it, with great speed and\r\nforce, down the pond. As the boat shot out from the shelter of the point\r\ninto this place of exposure, the storm struck them suddenly, with a\r\nblast which swept the bows of the boat at once round out of her course,\r\nand dashed the spray from the waves all over Rollo's face and shoulders.\r\nIt was with great difficulty that Jonas could bring the boat to the wind\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, however, at length, and they went on, for some time,\r\npitching and tossing, through the waves,--the wind pressing so hard upon\r\nthe boat that it was very difficult for Jonas to make any headway. The\r\nwind had changed its direction, so that it blew now almost exactly\r\nacross their course; and it required great exertion for Jonas to prevent\r\nbeing blown away down the pond, out of his track altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the wind rather increased than diminished; and the\r\nwater dashed in so much over the bows that Rollo had to dip it up with\r\nthe cover of the tin pail, and pour it out over the side of the boat\r\ninto the pond again. They were going on in this way, both toiling very\r\nlaboriously, when suddenly they began to hear a sound like distant\r\nthunder, somewhat louder than the ordinary roaring of the wind. They\r\nboth looked towards the shore in the direction from which the sound\r\ncame. On the declivity of a range of hills covered with forests they saw\r\nan unusual commotion among the trees. The tops were bowed down with\r\ngreat force; the branches were broken off, and Jonas thought that he\r\ncould see fragments of them flying in the air; and presently, farther\r\ndown, he observed several tall pines bending over, and then sinking down\r\ntill they disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"A squall,\" said Jonas,--\"and coming down directly upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Put the boat before the wind,\" replied Jonas, \"and let her run: we must\r\ngo where the squall carries us.\"\r\n\r\nJonas immediately began to pull the stern of the boat around with his\r\npaddle, so as to turn the head of it away from the quarter which the\r\nwind was blowing from; and then the wind drove the boat along very\r\nrapidly over the waves, which curled and foamed on each side, driving\r\nonward with great fury. When they looked around behind them, they saw\r\nthat the pond, which was of a very dark color, though spotted with the\r\nwhite tips of the waves all over its surface, was almost black for a\r\nlarge space in the direction from which the squall was coming. It\r\nadvanced with great rapidity, and at last struck the boat with a noise\r\nlike thunder. The froth and foam flew over the surface of the water like\r\ntufts of cotton, and the boat seemed to fly along the water with almost\r\nas much speed as they; and the roaring of the winds and waves was so\r\nloud that Rollo had great difficulty in making Jonas hear what he had to\r\nsay. After a few minutes, the violence of the wind somewhat abated; but\r\nit still blew a steady and furious gale, so that Jonas had to keep his\r\nboat directly before it. Thus they were driven on, wherever the wind\r\nchose to carry them, for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\nThen they began to draw near the land, far, however, very far from the\r\nplace where they had intended to go. Rollo observed that Jonas was\r\nlooking out very eagerly towards the shore, and he asked him what he was\r\nlooking for.\r\n\r\n\"Why, here we are,\" said Jonas, \"on a lee shore, and I am looking out\r\nfor a place to land.\"\r\n\r\nRollo looked, and saw that the waves were tumbling with great violence\r\nupon the rocks and gravelly beaches which lined the shore, and he was\r\nafraid that the boat would get dashed to pieces upon them. Jonas,\r\nhowever, observed a large tree, which originally stood upon the bank,\r\nbut which had fallen over, and now lay with its top partly submerged. He\r\nthought that this might afford him some shelter, and so he made great\r\nexertions to guide the boat so as to bring it in to the shore around\r\nbehind this tree. By means of great efforts he succeeded; and so he and\r\nRollo both escaped safe to land.\r\n\r\nThe boys did not get home until late that night, for they were thrown\r\nupon the shore nearly two miles from the Mill village, and of course\r\nthey had that distance to walk. Jonas was detained a little there, too,\r\nin making arrangements to send a boy for the boat after the storm had\r\nsubsided. When they got home, Rollo's father said that he was sorry for\r\ntheir fatigues and exposures, but he was very glad that Jonas had\r\npersevered and found the carpenter; for the high wind had blown down the\r\nback chimney and broken the roof over the kitchen, and it was very\r\nnecessary to have it repaired immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What is _momentum_? Has air momentum, when it is in motion, as\r\n    well as water? At what time in the spring of the year does the\r\n    sun rise at six o'clock? What did Rollo think was the prospect\r\n    in respect to the weather? What did Jonas think? What is meant\r\n    by being under the _lee_ of a shore? What is a _squall_? What\r\n    indications did Jonas observe of the approach of the squall?\r\n    What course did he pursue in order to avoid the danger of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAIR AT REST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the adventure described in the preceding chapter, Rollo\r\nheard his father proposing to his mother that they should take a walk\r\nthe next morning before breakfast. Rollo wanted to go too. His father\r\nsaid that they should be very glad to have his company; and he promised\r\nto wake him in season.\r\n\r\nRollo felt rather sleepy, when his father called him the next morning;\r\nbut he jumped up and dressed himself, and was ready first of all. It was\r\na cool, but a very pleasant morning. The sun was just coming up. The\r\nground in the path before the door was frozen a little, and the air\r\nseemed very still.\r\n\r\nWhen Rollo's mother came out to the door, she said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, husband, which way shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up on the rocks,\" said Rollo; \"let's go up on the rocks, mother. It\r\nwill be beautiful there this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied his mother; \"we'll go up on the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe place which Rollo called the rocks, was the summit of a rocky hill,\r\nwhich had a grassy slope upon one side, by which they could ascend, and\r\na precipice of ragged rocks upon the other. There was a very pleasant\r\nprospect from the top of the rocks.\r\n\r\nAs they walked along, Rollo said that it was very different weather that\r\nstill morning, from what it was the day that he and Jonas were out upon\r\nthe pond.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"you had an opportunity to see the effects of\r\nair in motion then.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now _air at rest_,\" replied Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty nearly,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, _entirely_,\" said Rollo; \"there is no wind at all, this\r\nmorning: hold up your hand, and you can feel.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo stopped a moment upon the grass, and held up his hand to see\r\nwhether there was any wind.\r\n\r\n\"I know there is not any wind that you can perceive in that way,\" said\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n\"How can we perceive it, then?\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you,\" replied his father, \"when we get to the top of the\r\nhill.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the top of the hill soon after this, and sat down upon a\r\nsmooth stone. There was a very wide prospect spread out before\r\nthem,--fields, forests, hamlets, streams,--and here and there, scattered\r\nover the landscape, a little patch of snow. The sun was just up, and the\r\nwhole scene was very bright and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"Now, father,\" said Rollo, \"tell me how you know that there is any wind\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that there was any _wind_. I said _motion of the air_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father,\" replied Rollo, \"I thought that wind was motion of the\r\nair.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" said his father; \"but all motion of the air is not wind.\r\nWind is a _current_ of air, that is, a _progressive_ motion;--and in\r\nfact, there is, this morning, a slight current from the westward.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you tell, father?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"By the smokes from the chimneys; don't you see that they all lean a\r\nlittle from the west towards the east?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not but a little, father;--and there's one, from that red house, which\r\ngoes up exactly straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father, \"there is one; but, in general, the columns of\r\nsmoke lean; which is proof that there is a gentle current of air to the\r\neastward.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Westward_, you said, father,\" rejoined Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _from_ the westward, but _to_ the eastward.\r\n\r\n\"That is what is called a progressive motion,\" continued Rollo's father;\r\n\"that is, the whole body of air makes progress; it advances from west to\r\neast. But there is another kind of motion, called a _vibratory_ motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a motion is that, father?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very hard kind to describe, at any rate,\" said his father. \"It\r\nis a kind of quivering, which begins in one place and spreads in every\r\ndirection. Don't you hear a kind of a thumping sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"a great way off; what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look over across the pond there,\" said his father; \"don't you see that\r\nman cutting wood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"that's what makes the noise.--No, father,\" he\r\ncontinued, after a moment's pause, \"that's not it. Look, father, and\r\nyou'll see that the thumping sound comes when his axe is lifted up.\"\r\n\r\nThey all looked, and found that it was as Rollo had said. The strokes of\r\nthe axe kept time, pretty well, with the sound of blows, which they\r\nheard, only the sounds did not correspond with the descent of the axe.\r\nWhen the axe appeared to strike the wood, they did not hear any sound,\r\nbut they did hear one every time the axe was lifted up.\r\n\r\n\"So, you see,\" said Rollo, \"it is not that man that we hear. There must\r\nbe some other man cutting wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will wait a minute,\" said his father, \"until he gets the log cut\r\noff, and then he will stop cutting; and we will see whether we cease to\r\nhear the sound.\"\r\n\r\nSo they sat still, and watched the man for a minute. Presently he\r\nstopped cutting,--and, to Rollo's great surprise, the sound stopped\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"That's strange,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more, the man had rolled the log over, and commenced cutting\r\nupon the other side; and in an instant after he began to cut, Rollo\r\nbegan to hear the sound of strokes again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"it must be his cutting that we hear; but it is very\r\nstrange that he makes a noise when he lifts up his axe, and no noise\r\nwhen it goes down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you how it is,\" said his father. \"He makes the noise when his\r\naxe goes down; but, then, it takes some little time for the sound to get\r\nhere; and by the time the sound gets here, his axe is up.\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said Rollo, \"is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied his father, \"that is it.\"\r\n\r\nRollo watched the motion of the axe several minutes longer in silence,\r\nand then his attention was attracted by the singing of a bird upon a\r\ntree in his father's garden, at a short distance below him.\r\n\r\nPretty soon, however, his mother said that it was time for her to\r\nreturn; and they all, accordingly, arose from their seats, and rambled\r\nalong together a short distance upon the brow of the hill, but towards\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"Then the sound moves along through the air,\" said Rollo, \"from the man\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his father; \"that is, there is a vibratory motion of the\r\nair,--a kind of quivering,--which begins where the man is, and spreads\r\nall around in every direction, until it reaches us. But there is no\r\n_progressive_ motion; that is, none of the air itself, where the man is\r\nat work, leaves him, and comes to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, husband,\" said Rollo's mother, \"I don't see how anything can come\r\nfrom where the man is, to us, unless it is the air itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is rather hard to understand,\" said his father. \"But I can make an\r\nexperiment with a string, when we get home, that will show you something\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nThey rambled about among the rocks for a short time longer, and then\r\nthey descended by a steep and crooked path, in a different place from\r\nwhere they had ascended. When they had got nearly home, Rollo said that\r\nhe would run forward and get his father's ball of twine and bring it\r\nout; and so have it all ready for the experiment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Rollo's father and mother arrived at the front door,\r\nthey found Rollo ready there with a small ball of twine in his hand,\r\nabout as large as an apple.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Rollo,\" said his father, \"you may take hold of the end of the\r\ntwine, and walk along out into the street, while I hold the ball, and\r\nlet the string unwind.\"\r\n\r\nRollo did so. He drew out a long piece of twine, as long as the whole\r\nfront of the house, and then he stopped to ask his father if that was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father; \"walk along.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo walked on for some distance farther, until, at last, the ball\r\nwas entirely unwound. Rollo had one end of it, and was standing at some\r\ndistance down the road, while his father, with the other end, stood at\r\nthe gate of the front yard. The middle of the string hung down pretty\r\nnear to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Draw tight, Rollo,\" said his father.\r\n\r\nSo Rollo pulled a little harder, and by that means drew the line\r\nstraighter.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said his father, \"walk along slowly.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rollo walked along, drawing the end of the line with him. His father\r\nfollowed with the other end. Thus they advanced several steps along the\r\nside of the road.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said his father. \"Stop. That, you see, was a _progressive_\r\nmotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"The whole string advanced along the road,\" added his father. \"It made\r\nprogress, and so it was a progressive motion. Now, fasten your end of\r\nthe string, Rollo, to that tree directly behind you.\"\r\n\r\nRollo looked behind him, and saw that he was standing near a small\r\nmaple-tree, which had been planted, a few years before, by the side of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\"Tie it right around the stem of the tree,\" said his father, \"about as\r\nhigh as your shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nRollo fastened the string as his father had directed. Then his father\r\nfastened _his_ end, in the same way, to another tree, which was growing\r\nnear where he was standing.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"there can be no more progressive motion, but there can\r\nbe a vibratory one. Take hold of the string near where it is fastened\r\nto the tree.\"\r\n\r\nRollo took hold of it, as his father had directed, and then his father\r\ntold him to shut his eyes. When his eyes were shut, so that he could not\r\nsee, his father said that he was going to strike the string, at his end\r\nof it, with his pencil-case, and he asked Rollo to observe whether he\r\ncould feel any motion.\r\n\r\nRollo held very still, while his father struck the string; and\r\nimmediately afterwards he called out, \"Yes, sir.\" Then his father struck\r\nthe string again, several times, and every time Rollo could feel a\r\ndistinct vibratory or quivering motion, which was transmitted very\r\nrapidly through the string, from one end to the other; although, as the\r\nstring was fastened by both ends to the trees, it was evident that there\r\ncould be no progressive motion.\r\n\r\nRollo's mother had been standing all this time at the step of the door,\r\nwatching the progress of the experiment; and, when she saw the\r\nexpression of satisfaction upon Rollo's countenance, while he was\r\nstanding, with his eyes shut, holding the end of the string, she wanted\r\nto come and take hold of it herself, so as to see what sort of a\r\nsensation the vibratory motion of the string produced.\r\n\r\nSo she came out through the gate, and asked Mr. Holiday to wait a moment\r\nwhile she went to where Rollo was standing, and took hold of the string.\r\nBut he said that it would not be necessary for her to go there, as she\r\ncould take hold of his end of the line just as well, and let Rollo\r\nstrike the other end.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly performed the experiment in that way, and Rollo's\r\nmother could feel the vibrations very distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"One thing you must observe,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"and that is, that the\r\nvibrations pass along from one end of the line to the other very quick\r\nindeed. We feel them at one end almost at the same instant that the\r\nother end is struck.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Exactly_ at the same instant, sir,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his father, \"not exactly at the same instant, though it is\r\nvery nearly the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see any difference,\" said Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied his father, \"you cannot perceive any difference in so\r\nshort a string, but if we had a string, or a wire, a mile long, I\r\npresume that we should find that it would require a sensible period of\r\ntime to transmit the vibrations from one end to the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a sensible period of time, father?\" asked Rollo.\r\n\r\n\"Why, a length of time that you could perceive,\" said his father; \"just\r\nas it was with the man cutting wood. We could see that some time elapsed\r\nbetween the striking of the blow, and our hearing the sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"just as long as it took him to lift up his axe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not certain,\" replied his father, \"because the sound that we\r\nheard might have belonged to a blow made before. That is, it might be\r\nthat, when he had struck one blow, he had time to raise his axe and\r\nstrike another, and then raise his axe again, before the sound of the\r\nfirst blow came to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo, \"I understand.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holiday then told Rollo that he might unfasten the string from the\r\ntrees, and wind it up again into a ball, and bring it in. Then he and\r\nRollo's mother went into the house, to see if breakfast was not almost\r\nready.\r\n\r\nThat morning, after they were all seated at the breakfast table, Rollo\r\nsaid to his father that he did not exactly understand what sort of a\r\nmotion the vibratory motion of the air was, after all.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, \"I suppose you do not. And, in fact, I do not\r\nunderstand it very perfectly myself. I only know that the philosophers\r\nsay, that, when a man strikes a blow with an axe upon a log of wood, it\r\nproduces a little quivering motion of the air, which spreads all around,\r\ndarting off in every direction very swiftly. If a boy strikes a tin pail\r\nwith a drum-stick, it makes another kind of quivering or vibration,\r\nwhich is different from that which is made by the axe; but I don't know\r\nprecisely how it differs. So, when the air is full of sounds, on a still\r\nmorning, it is full of these little vibrations, like a string which\r\ntrembles from end to end, though its ends are fastened so that it cannot\r\nmove away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the air is never at rest,\" said Rollo's mother.\r\n\r\n\"No; certainly not, when any sound is to be heard; and it is never\r\nperfectly silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing very extraordinary,\" said Mrs. Holiday.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Rollo's father.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that, when a great many sounds are made at the same time,\" she\r\nreplied,--\"as, for example, when we are upon the top of a hill, on a\r\nstill morning, and hear a great many separate sounds, as a man cutting\r\nwood, birds singing, a bell ringing, and perhaps a man shouting to his\r\noxen,--all those tremblings or vibrations, being in the air together, do\r\nnot interfere with one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"it is very extraordinary indeed. They do not\r\nseem to interfere at all. When there are too many sounds, or if there is\r\na wind with them, they do interfere; but, in a calm morning, like this,\r\nwhen the air is at rest, you can hear a great many distant sounds very\r\ndistinctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"and I mean to go up to the top of the rocks again\r\nafter breakfast, and listen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    What time of the year was it when Rollo took this walk? How did\r\n    Rollo satisfy himself that there was no wind at all? How did his\r\n    father prove that there was a little wind? Is all motion of the\r\n    air wind? What two kinds of motion are mentioned? What sound did\r\n    they hear? What made Rollo think the sound was not made by the\r\n    man whom they saw cutting wood? How did his father explain this\r\n    phenomenon? What experiment did they try with the string? Were\r\n    the vibrations transmitted slowly or rapidly through the string?\r\n    Did Rollo think that he understood perfectly the nature of the\r\n    vibrations? What extraordinary circumstance did Rollo's mother\r\n    mention at the breakfast table?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Rollo's Philosophy. [Air], by Jacob Abbott",
