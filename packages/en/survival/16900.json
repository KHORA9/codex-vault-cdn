GOODRICH\r\n\r\n  _Farmer_\r\n\r\n  Expert in the Bureau of Plant Industry, United States\r\n  Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n  _Illustrated_\r\n\r\n\r\n  GARDEN CITY NEW YORK\r\n  DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & COMPANY\r\n  1923\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1905, by\r\n  DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & COMPANY\r\n  PUBLISHED MARCH, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n  AT\r\n  THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS, GARDEN CITY, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most successful farmers of the present day are those who work in\r\nharmony with the forces and laws of nature which control the growth\r\nand development of plants and animals. These men have gained their\r\nknowledge of those laws and forces by careful observation, experiment\r\nand study.\r\n\r\nThis book is a result of the author's search for these facts and\r\ntruths as a student and farmer and his endeavor as a teacher to\r\npresent them in a simple manner to others.\r\n\r\nThe object in presenting the book to the general public is the hope\r\nthat it may be of assistance to farmers, students and teachers, in\r\ntheir search for the fundamental truths and principles of farming.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the book an attempt has been made to select the\r\nmost important and fundamental truths and principles underlying all\r\nagriculture and to present them in the order of their importance,\r\nbeginning with the most important.\r\n\r\nAn endeavor has been made to present these truths to the reader and\r\nstudent in a simple and interesting manner. As far as possible each\r\nadvance step is based on a previously stated fact or truth. A number\r\nof side truths are introduced at various places.\r\n\r\nA number of simple experiments have been introduced into the text in\r\nthe belief that they will make the work more interesting to the\r\ngeneral reader, and will aid the student in learning to make simple\r\ninvestigations for himself.\r\n\r\nThe author recommends all who use the book to perform the experiments\r\nand to make the observations, and so come actively in touch with the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe observations begin on the farm. The author considers the plant the\r\ncentral and all-important factor or agent on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe root is regarded as the most important part of the plant to\r\nitself, and consequently to the plant grower.\r\n\r\nThe general truths or principles which state the conditions necessary\r\nfor the growth and development of plant roots are regarded as the\r\nfoundation truths or fundamental principles of all agriculture. These\r\ntruths are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe roots of farm plants need for their best growth and development:\r\n\r\nA firm, mellow soil.\r\n\r\nA moist soil.\r\n\r\nA ventilated soil.\r\n\r\nA warm soil.\r\n\r\nA soil supplied with plant food.\r\n\r\nThe first two chapters lead the reader quickly through logical\r\nreasoning to these fundamental truths, on which the remainder of the\r\nwork is based.\r\n\r\nA study of soils is made in connection with the root studies, as the\r\ntwo are so closely related.\r\n\r\nAfter the study of roots and soils the other parts of the plant are\r\nconsidered in the order of their importance to the farmer or plant\r\ngrower. The aim is always to get at fundamental facts and principles\r\nunderlying all agricultural and horticultural practice.\r\n\r\nThe author regards the conditions necessary to root growth and\r\ndevelopment as the important factor constituting soil fertility, and\r\nin the last ten chapters takes up the discussion of certain farm\r\noperations and practices and their effects on these necessary\r\nconditions, and consequently their effect on the fertility of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe author extends gratitude to all who have in any way assisted in\r\nthe preparation of this book, whether through advice, preparation of\r\nthe text, preparation of the illustrations, or any other way in which\r\nhe has received assistance.\r\n\r\n  C.L.

In other words, it will be\r\nof much greater value to you if you will make the observations and\r\ninvestigations and find out for yourselves the important facts and\r\nprinciples rather than simply take statements of the book\r\nunquestioned.\r\n\r\nA very good time to begin this work is during the latter part of the\r\nsummer, when the summer crops are ripening and the fall and winter\r\ncrops are starting into growth. So suppose we begin our study with a\r\nvisit to some farm in early September, to bring to mind the many\r\nthings a farmer works with, the many things he has to think about and\r\nknow about.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the farm we will probably see first the farm-house\r\nsurrounded by shade trees, perhaps elms or maples, with the barns and\r\nother buildings grouped nearby. As we pass up the front walk we notice\r\nmore or less lawn of neatly clipped grass, with flower beds bordering\r\nthe walk, or we may find a number of chickens occupying the front\r\nyard, and the flower beds, placed in red half-barrels, set upon short\r\nposts. In the flower beds we may find petunias, nasturtiums,\r\ngeraniums, rose bushes and other flowering plants. Going around the\r\nhouse, we come upon the dairy, with its rack of cans and pans set out\r\nfor the daily sunning and airing. Nearby is a well with its oaken\r\nbucket; at the barn we find the farmer, and he very kindly consents to\r\ngo with us to answer questions. In the barn and sheds we find wagons,\r\nplows, harrows, seed drills, hoes, rakes, scythes and many other tools\r\nand machines. Passing on to the fields, we go through the vegetable\r\ngarden, where are carrots, parsnips, cabbages, beets, celery, sage and\r\nmany other vegetables and herbs.\r\n\r\nOn the right, we see a field of corn just ready to harvest, and beyond\r\na field of potatoes. On the left is the orchard, and we are invited to\r\nrefresh ourselves with juicy apples. In the field beyond the hired\r\nman is plowing with a fine team of horses. In the South we would find\r\na field of cotton and one of sweet potatoes, and perhaps sugar cane or\r\npeanuts. We have not failed to notice the pig weeds in the corn field\r\nnor the rag weed in the wheat stubble, and many other weeds and\r\ngrasses in the fence corners.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may meet the cows coming from pasture to the stable. All\r\nthe way we have been trampling on something very important which we\r\nwill notice on our way back. In this field we find a coarse sandy\r\nsoil, in the next one a soil that is finer and stiffer. The plow is\r\nturning up a reddish soil. In the garden we find the soil quite dark\r\nin color.\r\n\r\nBut these are only a few of the things we have found. If you have used\r\nyour notebook you will discover that you have long lists of objects\r\nwhich you have noticed, and these may be grouped under the following\r\nheadings: Animals, Plants, Soils, Buildings, Tools, etc.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, then, in his work on the farm deals with certain agents,\r\nchief among which are Soils, Plants, Animals, Tools and Buildings.\r\nOther agents which assist or retard his work according to\r\ncircumstances are the air, sunlight, heat, moisture, plant food,\r\nmicroscopic organisms called bacteria, etc. These agents are\r\ncontrolled in their relations to one another by certain forces which\r\nwork according to certain laws and principles of nature. To work\r\nintelligently and to obtain the best results the farmer must become\r\nfamiliar with these agents and must work in harmony with the laws and\r\nprinciples which control them.\r\n\r\nLet us take up the study of some of these groups of agents, beginning\r\nwith the most important or central one on the farm.\r\n\r\nWhich do you think is the most important group? Some will say \"tools.\"\r\nThe majority will probably say, study the soil first, \"because we must\r\nwork the soil before we can grow good crops.\" Some few will mention\r\n\"plants.\" This last is right. The farm animals are dependent on plants\r\nfor food. We till or work the soil to produce plants. Plants are\r\nliving, growing things, and certain requirements or conditions are\r\nnecessary for their growth and development; we cannot intelligently\r\nprepare the soil for plant growth until we know something about the\r\nwork of plants and the conditions they need to do their work well.\r\n\r\nFor our first study of plants let us get together a number of farm and\r\ngarden plants. Say, we have a corn plant, cotton, beet, turnip,\r\ncarrot, onion, potato, grass, geranium, marigold, pigweed, thistle, or\r\nother farm or garden plants. In each case get the entire plant, with\r\nas much root as possible. Do these plants in any way resemble one\r\nanother? All are green, all have roots, all have stems and leaves,\r\nsome of them have flowers, fruit, and seeds, and the others in time\r\nwill produce them.\r\n\r\nWhy does the farmer raise these plants? For food for man and animals;\r\nfor clothing; for ornamental purposes; for pleasure, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SPECIMEN PLANTS FOR STUDY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\nThe first effort of a sprouting seed is to send a root down into the\r\nsoil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\nGerminating seeds produce roots before they send a shoot up into the\r\nair.]\r\n\r\nWhich part of any or all of these farm plants is of greatest\r\nimportance to the plant itself?\r\n\r\nI am sure that you will agree that the root is the part most important\r\nto the plant itself, for if any part of a plant be separated from the\r\nroot, that part ceases growth and will soon die, unless it is able to\r\nput out new roots. But the root from which the plant was cut will\r\ngenerally send up new shoots, unless it has nearly completed its life\r\nwork. When a slip or cutting is placed in water or in moist sand it\r\nmakes a root before it continues much in growth. When a seed is\r\nplanted its first effort is to send a rootlet down into the soil.\r\n\r\nExperiment to see if this is true by planting slips of willow, or\r\ngeranium, or by planting corn or beans in a glass tumbler of soil, or\r\nin a box having a glass side, placing the seeds close to the glass;\r\nthen watch and see what the seed does. Figs. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nWhich of the parts of the plant is of greatest importance to the\r\nfarmer or any plant grower, or to which part of a plant should the\r\nplant grower give his best attention? You will probably mention\r\ndifferent parts of the different plants in answering this question.\r\nFor instance, some will say, \"The seed is the most important part of\r\nthe wheat plant to the farmer, for that is what the wheat is grown\r\nfor.\" \"The fruit is the most important part of the apple plant for the\r\nsame reason.\" \"The leaves and grain of the corn, the leaves of the\r\ncabbage, are the important parts of these plants and should have the\r\nbest attention of the grower, because they are the parts for which he\r\ngrows the plants.\" But you must remember that all of these parts are\r\ndependent on the root for life and growth, as was brought out in the\r\nanswer to the last question, and that if the farmer or plant grower\r\ndesires a fine crop of leaves, stems, flowers, fruit or seeds, he must\r\ngive his very best attention to the root. Judging from the poor way in\r\nwhich many farmers and plant growers prepare the soil for the plants\r\nthey raise, and the poor way they care for the soil during the growth\r\nof the plants, they evidently think least of, and give least attention\r\nto, the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\nThen, in studying our plants, which part shall we study first? Why,\r\nthe roots, of course: To find out what they do for the plant, how they\r\ndo this work, and what conditions are necessary for them to grow and\r\nto do their work well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nROOTS\r\n\r\nUSES OF ROOTS TO PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what use are roots to plants, or, what work do they perform for the\r\nplants?\r\n\r\nIf the reader has ever tried to pull up weeds or other plants he will\r\nagree that one function of the roots of plants is to hold them firmly\r\nin place while they are growing.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Pull two plants from the soil, shake them free of\r\nearth, and place the roots of one in water and expose the roots of the\r\nother to the air. Notice that the plant whose roots are exposed to the\r\nair soon wilts, while the one whose roots were placed in water keeps\r\nfresh. You have noticed how a potted plant will wilt if the soil in\r\nthe pot is allowed to become dry (see Fig. 4), or how the leaves of\r\ncorn and other plants curl up and wither during long periods of dry\r\nweather. It is quite evident roots absorb moisture from the soil for\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Plant some seeds in tumblers or in boxes filled with\r\nsand and in others filled with good garden soil. Keep them well\r\nwatered and watch their progress for a few weeks (see Fig. 5). The\r\nplants in the garden soil will grow larger than those in the sand. The\r\nroots evidently must get food from the soil and those in the good\r\ngarden soil get more than those in the poorer sand. Another important\r\nfunction of plant roots then is to take food from the soil for the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nYou know how thick and fleshy the roots of radishes, beets and turnips\r\nare. Well, go into the garden and see if you can find a spring radish\r\nor an early turnip that has sent up a flower stalk, blossomed and\r\nproduced seeds. If you are successful, cut the root in two and notice\r\nthat instead of being hard and fleshy like the young radish or turnip,\r\nit has become hollow, or soft and spongy (see Fig. 6). Evidently the\r\nhard, fleshy young root was packed with food, which it afterwards gave\r\nup to produce flower stalk and seeds.\r\n\r\nA fourth use of the root, then, is to store food for the future use of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Plant a sweet potato or place it with the lower end in\r\na tumbler of water and set it in a warm room. Observe it from day to\r\nday as it puts out new shoots bearing leaves and roots (see Fig. 7).\r\nBreak these off and plant them in soil and you have a number of new\r\nplants. If you can get the material, repeat this experiment with roots\r\nof horse-radish, raspberry, blackberry or dahlia. From this we see\r\nthat it is the work of some roots to produce new plants. This function\r\nof roots is made use of in propagating or obtaining new plants of the\r\nsweet potato, horse-radish, blackberry, raspberry, dahlia and other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\nTo show that plant-roots take water from the soil, the plants in _A_\r\nare suffering from thirst. _B_ has sufficient water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\nTo show that plant roots take food from the soil. Both boxes were\r\nplanted at the same time.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\nA radish root, from which the stored food has been used to help\r\nproduce a crop of seeds. Notice the spindle shaded seed-vessels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\nA sweet-potato root producing new plants.]\r\n\r\nWe have now learned five important things that roots do for plants,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\nRoots hold plants firmly in place.\r\n\r\nThey absorb water from the soil for the plants.\r\n\r\nThey absorb food from the soil for the plants.\r\n\r\nSome roots store food for the future use of the plant.\r\n\r\nSome roots produce new plants.\r\n\r\nHow do the roots do this work? To answer this question it will be\r\nnecessary to study the habit of growth of the roots of our plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABIT OF GROWTH OF ROOTS\r\n\r\nThe proper place to begin this study is in the field or garden. So we\r\nwill make another excursion, and this time we will take with us a\r\npick-axe or mattock, a shovel or two, a sharp stick, a quart or\r\nhalf-gallon pitcher, and several buckets of water. Arrived in the\r\nfield, we will select a well-developed plant, say, of corn, potato or\r\ncotton. Then we will dig a hole about six feet long, three feet wide,\r\nand five or six feet deep, close to the plant, letting one side come\r\nabout four or five inches from the base of the plant. It will be well\r\nto have this hole run across the row rather than lengthwise with it.\r\nThen with the pitcher pour water about the base of the plant and wash\r\nthe soil away from the roots. Gently loosening the soil with the\r\nsharpened stick will hasten this work. In this way carefully expose\r\nthe roots along the side of the hole, tracing them as far as possible\r\nlaterally and as deep as possible, taking care to loosen them as\r\nlittle as possible from their natural position. (See Figs. 8 and 9.)\r\nHaving exposed the roots of one kind of plant to a width and depth of\r\nfive or six feet, expose the roots of six or eight plants of different\r\nkinds to a depth of about eighteen inches. As this may require more\r\ntime than we can take for it in one day, it will be well to cover the\r\nexposed roots with some old burlaps or other material until we have\r\nthem all ready, in order to keep them from drying and from injury.\r\n\r\nWhen all is ready we will study the root system of each plant and\r\nanswer these four questions:\r\n\r\nIn what part of the soil are most of the roots?\r\n\r\nHow deep do they penetrate the soil?\r\n\r\nHow near do they come to the surface of the soil?\r\n\r\nHow far do they reach out sidewise or laterally from the plant?\r\n\r\nTo the first question, \"In what part of the soil are most of the\r\nroots?\" you will give the following answers: \"In the upper layer.\" \"In\r\nthe surface soil.\" \"In the softer soil.\" \"In the darker soil.\" \"In the\r\nplowed soil.\"\r\n\r\nThese are all correct, but the last is the important one. Most of the\r\nroots will be formed in that part of the soil that has been plowed or\r\nspaded.\r\n\r\nThe second question, \"How deep do the roots penetrate the soil?\" is\r\neasily answered. Roots will be found penetrating the soil to depths of\r\nfrom two to six feet or more. (See Fig. 8.) The author has traced the\r\nroots of cowpea and soy bean plants to depths of five and six feet,\r\ncorn roots four and five feet, parsnips over six feet. The\r\nsweet-potato roots illustrated in Fig. 8 penetrated the soil to a\r\ndepth of over five feet. The roots of alfalfa or lucern have been\r\ntraced to depths of from thirteen to sixteen feet or more.\r\n\r\nHow near to the surface of the soil do you find roots? Main side or\r\nlateral roots will be found within two or three inches of the surface,\r\nand little rootlets from these will be found reaching up as near the\r\nsurface as there is a supply of moisture. After a continued period of\r\nwet weather, if the soil has not been disturbed, roots will be found\r\ncoming to the very surface and even running along the top of the soil.\r\n\r\nAs to the fourth question, How far do roots reach out sidewise or\r\nlaterally from the plant? you will find roots extending three, four,\r\nfive and even six or more feet from the plant. They have numerous\r\nbranches and rootlets, which fill all parts of the upper soil. Tree\r\nroots have been found thirty or forty feet in length.\r\n\r\nWe started on this observation lesson to find out something about the\r\nhabit of growth of roots, so that we could tell how the roots do their\r\nwork for the plant. But before going on with that question, let us\r\nstop right here and see whether we cannot find some very important\r\nlessons for the farmer and plant grower from what we have already\r\nseen. Is a knowledge of these facts we have learned about roots of any\r\nvalue to the farmer? Let us examine each case and see.\r\n\r\nOf what value is it to the farmer to know that the larger part of the\r\nroots of farm plants develop in that part of the soil that has been\r\nplowed or spaded? It tells him that plowing tends to bring about the\r\nsoil conditions which are favorable to the growth and development of\r\nroots. Therefore, the deeper he plows, the deeper is the body of the\r\nsoil having conditions best suited for root growth, and the larger\r\nwill be the crop which grows above the soil.\r\n\r\nOf what value is it to the farmer to know that the roots of farm\r\nplants penetrate to depths of five or six feet in the soil? To answer\r\nthis question it will be necessary for us to know something of the\r\nconditions necessary for root growth. So we will leave this till\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nOf what value is it to the farmer to know that many of the roots of\r\nhis farm plants come very near the surface of the soil? It tells him\r\nthat he should be careful in cultivating his crop to injure as few of\r\nthese roots as possible. In some parts of the country, particularly in\r\nthe South, the tool commonly used for field cultivation is a small\r\nplow. This is run alongside of the row, throwing the soil from the\r\ncrop, and then again throwing the soil to the crop. Suppose we\r\ninvestigate, and see how this affects the roots of the crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\nSweet potato roots. The great mass of the roots is in the plowed soil.\r\nMany of them reach out 5 to 7 feet from the plant. Some reach a depth\r\nof more than 5 feet, and others come to the very surface of the soil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\nSoy-bean roots showing location, extent and depth of root-growth.]\r\n\r\nLet us visit a field where some farmer is working a crop with a plow,\r\nor get him to do it, for the sake of the lesson. We will ask him to\r\nstop the plow somewhere opposite a plant, then we will dig a hole a\r\nlittle to one side of the plow and wash away the soil from over the\r\nplow (see Fig. 10), and see where the roots are. We will find that the\r\nplow-point runs under many strong-feeding lateral roots and tears them\r\noff, thus checking the feeding power of the plant, and consequently\r\nchecking its growth. Now, if we can get a cultivator, we will have\r\nthat run along the row and then wash away the loosened soil. It will\r\nbe found that few, if any, of the main lateral roots have been\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nIs it of any value to the farmer to know that roots extend laterally\r\nthree to six feet and more on all sides of the plant, and that every\r\npart of the upper soil is filled with their branches and rootlets?\r\nThis fact has a bearing on the application of manures and fertilizers.\r\nIt tells the farmer that when he applies the manure and fertilizers to\r\nthe soil he should mix the most of them thoroughly all through the\r\nsoil, placing only a little directly in the row to start the young\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nTo find out how quickly the roots reach out into the soil, wash the\r\nsoil away from some seedlings that have been growing only a few days,\r\nsay, seven, ten and fifteen. (See Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nFrom our observations, then, we have learned the important lessons of\r\ndeep, thorough plowing, careful shallow after-cultivation, and that\r\nfertilizers should be well mixed with the soil.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to go back to our study of the habit of growth of\r\nroots, and can perhaps tell something of how the root does its work\r\nfor the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to see how the roots hold the plant firmly in place,\r\nfor they penetrate so thoroughly every part of the soil, and to such\r\ndistances, that they hold with a grip that makes it impossible to\r\nremove the plant from the soil without tearing it free from the roots.\r\n\r\nIt is also on account of this very thorough reaching out through the\r\nsoil that the roots are able to supply the plant with sufficient\r\nmoisture and food.\r\n\r\nWe have doubtless observed that most of these roots are very slender\r\nand many very delicate. How did they manage to reach out into the soil\r\nso far from the plant? Or where does the root grow in length? To\r\nanswer this question I will ask you to perform the following\r\nexperiment:\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Place some kernels of corn or other large seeds on a\r\nplate between the folds of a piece of wet cloth. Cover with a pane of\r\nglass or another plate. Keep the cloth moist till the seeds sprout and\r\nthe young plants have roots two or three inches long. Now have at hand\r\na plate, two pieces of glass, 4 by 6 inches, a piece of white cloth\r\nabout 4 by 8 inches, a spool of dark thread, and two burnt matches, or\r\nsmall slivers of wood. A shallow tin pan may be used in place of the\r\nplate. Lay one pane of glass on the plate, letting one end rest in the\r\nbottom of the plate and the other on the opposite edge of the plate.\r\nAt one end of the piece of cloth cut two slits on opposite sides about\r\nan inch down from the end and reaching nearly to the middle. Wet the\r\ncloth and spread it on the glass. Take one of the sprouted seeds, lay\r\nit on the cloth, tie pieces of thread around the main root at\r\nintervals of one-quarter inch from tip to seed. Tie carefully, so that\r\nthe root will not be injured. Place the second pane of glass over the\r\nroots, letting the edge come just below the seed, slipping in the\r\nslivers of wood to prevent the glass crushing the roots. Wrap the two\r\nflaps of the cloth about the seed. Pour some water in the plate and\r\nleave for development. (Fig. 12.) A day or two of waiting will show\r\nconclusively that the lengthening takes place at the tip only, or just\r\nback of the tip. Is this fact of any value to the farmer? Yes. The\r\nsoft tender root tips will force their way through a mellow soil with\r\ngreater ease and rapidity than through a hard soil, and the more rapid\r\nthe root growth the more rapid the development of the plant. This\r\nteaches us again the lesson of deep, thorough breaking and pulverizing\r\nof the soil before the crop is planted.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that the roots grow out into the soil in search of\r\nmoisture and food, which they absorb for the use of the plant. How\r\ndoes the root take in moisture and food? Many people think that there\r\nare little mouths at the tips of the roots, and that the food and\r\nmoisture are taken in through them. This is not so, for examination\r\nwith the most powerful microscopes fails to discover any such mouths.\r\nSprout seeds of radish, turnip or cabbage, or other seeds, on dark\r\ncloth, placed in plates and kept moist. Notice the fuzz or mass of\r\nroot hairs near the ends of the tender roots of the seedlings (Fig.\r\n13). Plant similar seed in sand or soil, and when they have started\r\nto grow pull them up and notice how difficult it is to remove all of\r\nthe sand or dirt from the roots. This is because the delicate root\r\nhairs cling so closely to the soil grains. The root hairs are\r\nabsorbing moisture laden with plant food from the surface of the soil\r\nparticles. The root hairs are found only near the root tips. As the\r\nroot grows older, its surface becomes tougher and harder, and the\r\nhairs die, while new ones appear on the new growth just back of the\r\nroot tips, which are constantly reaching out after moisture and food.\r\nThe moisture gets into the root hairs by a process called osmose. The\r\nfollowing interesting experiment will give you an idea of this process\r\nor force of osmose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\nA plow stopped in the furrow, to show what it does to the roots of\r\nplants when used for after-cultivation. Notice the point of the plow\r\nunder the roots.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.\r\nA corn-plant ten days after planting the seed. To show how quickly the\r\nroots reach out into the soil. Some of the roots were over 18 inches\r\nlong.]\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Procure a wide-mouthed bottle, an egg, a glass tube\r\nabout three inches long and a quarter-inch in diameter, a candle, and\r\na piece of wire a little longer than the tube. Remove a part of the\r\nshell from the large end of the egg without breaking the skin beneath.\r\nThis is easily done by gently tapping the shell with the handle of a\r\npocket-knife until it is full of small cracks, and then, with the\r\nblade of the knife, picking off the small pieces. In this way remove\r\nthe shell from the space about the size of a nickel. Remove the shell\r\nfrom the small end of the egg over a space about as large as the end\r\nof the glass tube. Next, from the lower end of the candle cut a piece\r\nabout one-half inch long. Bore a hole in this just the size of the\r\nglass tube. Now soften one end of the piece of candle with the hole\r\nin it and stick it on to the small end of the egg so that the hole in\r\nthe candle comes over the hole in the egg. Heat the wire, and with it\r\nsolder the piece of candle more firmly to the egg, making a\r\nwater-tight joint. Place the glass tube in the hole in the piece of\r\ncandle, pushing it down till it touches the egg. Then, with the heated\r\nwire, solder the tube firmly in place. Now run the wire down the tube\r\nand break the skin of the egg just under the end of the tube. Fill the\r\nbottle with water till it overflows, and set the egg on the bottle,\r\nthe large end in contact with the water (Fig. 14). In an hour or so\r\nthe contents of the egg will be seen rising in the glass tube. This\r\nhappens because the water is making its way by osmose into the egg\r\nthrough the skin, which has no openings, so far as can be discovered.\r\nIf the bottle is kept supplied with water as fast as it is taken up by\r\nthe egg, almost the entire contents of the egg will be forced out of\r\nthe tube. In this way water in which plant food is dissolved enters\r\nthe slender root hairs and rises through the plant.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--This process of osmose may also be shown as follows\r\n(Fig. 15): Remove the shell from the large end of an egg without\r\nbreaking the skin, break a hole in the small end of the egg and empty\r\nout the contents of the egg; rinse the shell with water. Fill a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle with water colored with a few drops of red ink.\r\nFill the egg-shell partly full of clear water and set it on the bottle\r\nof colored water. Colored water will gradually pass through the\r\nmembrane of the egg and color the water in the shell. Prepare another\r\negg in the same way, but put colored water in the shell and clear\r\nwater in the bottle. The colored water in the shell will pass through\r\nthe skin and color the water in the bottle. Sugar or salt may be used\r\nin place of the red ink, and their presence after passing through the\r\nmembrane may be detected by taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR ROOT GROWTH\r\n\r\nWe have learned some of the things that the roots do for plants and a\r\nlittle about how the work is done. The next thing to find out is:\r\n\r\nWhat conditions are necessary for the root to do its work?\r\n\r\nWe know that a part of the work of the root is to penetrate the soil\r\nand hold the plant firmly in place. Therefore, it needs a firm soil.\r\n\r\nWe know that the part of the root which penetrates the soil is tender\r\nand easily injured. Therefore, for rapid growth the root needs a\r\nmellow soil.\r\n\r\nWe know that part of the work of the root is to take moisture from the\r\nsoil. Therefore, it needs a moist soil.\r\n\r\nWe know that part of the work of the root is to take food from the\r\nsoil. Therefore, it needs a soil well supplied with plant food.\r\n\r\nWe know that roots stop their work in cold weather. Therefore, they\r\nneed a warm soil.\r\n\r\nAnother condition needed by roots we will find out by experiment.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take two wide-mouthed clear glass bottles (Fig. 16);\r\nfill one nearly full of water from the well or hydrant; fill the other\r\nbottle nearly full of water that has been boiled and cooled; place in\r\neach bottle a slip or cutting of Wandering Jew (called also inch\r\nplant, or tradescantia, and spiderwort), or some other plant that\r\nroots readily in water. Then pour on top of the boiled water about a\r\nquarter of an inch of oil--lard oil or cotton-seed oil or salad oil.\r\nThis is to prevent the absorption of air. In a few days roots will\r\nappear on the slip in the hydrant water, while only a very few short\r\nones, if any, will appear in the boiled water, and they will soon\r\ncease growing. Why is this? To answer this question, try another\r\nexperiment. Take two bottles, filled as before, one with hydrant water\r\nand the other with boiled water; drop into each a slip of glass or a\r\nspoon or piece of metal long enough so that one end will rest on the\r\nbottom and the other against the side of the bottle, and let stand for\r\nan hour or so (Fig. 17). At the end of that time bubbles of air will\r\nbe seen collecting on the glass or spoon in the hydrant water, but\r\nnone in the boiled water. This shows us that water contains more or\r\nless air, and that boiling the water drives this air out. The cutting\r\nin the boiled water did not produce roots because there was no air in\r\nit and the oil kept it from absorbing any.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Into some tumblers of moist sand put cuttings of\r\nseveral kinds of plants that root readily (Fig. 18), geranium,\r\ntradescantia, begonia, etc. Put cuttings of same plants into tumblers\r\nfilled with clay that has been wet and stirred very thoroughly, until\r\nit is about the consistency of cake batter. Keep the sand and puddled\r\nclay moist; do not allow the clay to crack, which it will do if it\r\ndries. The cuttings in the sand will strike root and grow, while most,\r\nif not all, those in the clay will soon die. The reason for this is\r\nthat the sand is well ventilated and there is sufficient air for root\r\ndevelopment, while the clay is very poorly ventilated, and there is\r\nnot sufficient air for root growth.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show us that to develop and do their work roots need\r\nair or a well-ventilated soil.\r\n\r\nWe have found the conditions which are necessary for the growth and\r\ndevelopment of plant roots, namely:\r\n\r\nA firm, mellow soil.\r\n\r\nA moist soil.\r\n\r\nA soil supplied with available plant food.\r\n\r\nA warm soil.\r\n\r\nA ventilated soil.\r\n\r\nThese are the most important facts about plant growth so far as the\r\nplant grower is concerned. In other words, these conditions which are\r\nnecessary for root growth and development are the most important\r\ntruths of agriculture, or they are the foundation truths or principles\r\nupon which all agriculture is based. Having found these conditions,\r\nthe next most important step is to find out how to bring them about in\r\nthe soil, or, if they already exist, how to keep them or to improve\r\nthem. This brings us, then, to a study of soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\nTo show where growth in length of the root takes place. Forty hours\r\nbefore the photograph was taken the tip of the root was ¼ inch from\r\nthe lowest thread.

We learned also that for roots to do these things well, the soil\r\nin which they grow must be mellow and firm, and must contain moisture\r\nand plant food, air must circulate in its pores and it must be warm.\r\n\r\nHow can we bring about these conditions? To answer this question\r\nintelligently it will be necessary for us to study the soil to find\r\nout something about its structure, its composition, its\r\ncharacteristics; also, how it was made and what forces or agencies\r\nwere active in making it. Are these forces acting on the soil at the\r\npresent time? Do they have any influence over the conditions which are\r\nfavorable or unfavorable to plant growth? If so, can we control them\r\nin their action for the benefit or injury of plants?\r\n\r\nWe will begin this soil study with an excursion and a few experiments.\r\n\r\nGo to the field. Examine the soil in the holes dug for the root\r\nlessons, noticing the difference between the upper or surface soil and\r\nthe under or subsoil. Examine as many kinds of surface soils and\r\nsubsoils as possible, also decayed leaf mould, the black soil of the\r\nwoods, etc. If there are in the neighborhood any exposed embankments\r\nwhere a road has been cut through a hill, or where a river or the sea\r\nwater has cut into a bank of soil, visit them and examine the exposed\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Place in separate pans, dishes, plates, boxes, or on\r\nboards, one or two pints each of sand, clay, decayed vegetable matter\r\nor leaf mould or woods soil, and garden soil. The soil should be fresh\r\nfrom the field. Examine the sand, clay and leaf mould, comparing them\r\nas to color; are they light or dark, are they moist or not? Test the\r\nsoils for comparative size of particles by rubbing between the fingers\r\n(Fig. 19), noticing if they are coarse or fine, and for stickiness by\r\nsqueezing in the hand and noting whether or not they easily crumble\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take samples, about a teaspoonful, of sand, clay and\r\nleaf mould. Dry them and then place each in an iron spoon or on a\r\nsmall coal shovel and heat in stove to redness. It will be found that\r\nthe leaf mould will smoke and burn, and will diminish in amount,\r\nwhile the sand and clay will not.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take two wide-mouthed bottles; fill both nearly full of\r\nwater. Into one put about a teaspoonful of clay and into the other the\r\nsame amount of sand; shake both bottles thoroughly and set on table to\r\nsettle (Fig. 20). It will be found that the sand settles very quickly\r\nand the clay very slowly.\r\n\r\nAs the result of our three experiments we will find something as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nSand is light in color, moist, coarse, not sticky, settles quickly in\r\nwater, and will not burn.\r\n\r\nClay is darker in color, moist, very fine, quite sticky, settles\r\nslowly in water, and will not burn.\r\n\r\nLeaf mould or humus is very dark in color, moist, very fine, slightly\r\nsticky, and burns when placed in the fire.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--We now have knowledge and means for making simple tests\r\nof soils. Repeat the last three experiments with the garden soil. We\r\nwill find, perhaps, that it is dark in color and some of it burns away\r\nwhen placed in the fire, therefore it contains organic matter or\r\ndecaying vegetable matter or humus, as it is called. This sample has\r\nperhaps fine particles and coarse particles; part of it will settle\r\nquickly in water while part settles very slowly, and it is sticky.\r\nTherefore we conclude that there are both clay and sand in it. If we\r\nshake a sample of it in a bottle of water and let it settle for\r\nseveral days, we can tell roughly from the layers of soil in the\r\nbottom of the bottle the relative amounts of sand and clay in the\r\nsoil. Also if we weigh a sample before and after burning we can tell\r\nroughly the amount of organic matter in the soil. Test a number of\r\nsoils and determine roughly the proportions of sand, clay and organic\r\nmatter in them.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take the pans of soil used in our first soil experiment\r\nand separate the soils in the pans into two parts by a trench across\r\nthe centre on the pan. Now wet the soil in one side of the pan and\r\nstir it with a stick or a spoon, carefully smooth the surface of the\r\nsoil in the other side of the pan and pour or sprinkle some water on\r\nit, but do not stir it. Set the pans aside till the soils are dry.\r\nThis drying may take several days and in the meantime we will study\r\nthe classification of soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.\r\nTo show that roots need air. Bottle _A_ was supplied with fresh water,\r\nand bottle _B_ with water that had been boiled to drive the air out\r\nand then cooled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.\r\nBottle _A_ contains fresh water, bottle _B_ contains boiled water.\r\nNotice the air bubbles in bottle _A._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.\r\nTumblers _A_ and _C_ contained moist sand, _B_ and _D_ contained\r\npuddled clay. Cuttings in _B_ and _D_ died, because there was not\r\nsufficient ventilation in the clay for root-development.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOILS\r\n\r\nSoil materials and soils are classified as follows:\r\n\r\n_Stones._--Coarse, irregular or rounded rock fragments or pieces of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n_Gravel._--Coarse fragments and pebbles ranging in size from several\r\ninches in diameter down to 1/25 inch.\r\n\r\n_Sand._--Soil particles ranging from 1/25 of an inch down to 1/500 of\r\nan inch in diameter. Sand is divided into several grades or sizes.\r\n\r\n  Coarse sand 1/25 to 1/50 of an inch.\r\n  Medium sand 1/50 to 1/100 of an inch.\r\n  Fine sand 1/100 to 1/250 of an inch.\r\n  Very fine sand 1/250 to 1/500 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThese grades of sand correspond very nearly with the grains of\r\ngranulated and soft sugar and fine table salt.\r\n\r\n_Silt._--Fine soil particles ranging from 1/500 to 1/5000 of an inch\r\nin diameter. It feels very fine and smooth when rubbed between the\r\nfingers, especially when moist. A good illustration of silt is the\r\nsilicon used for cleaning knives, a small amount of which can be\r\nobtained at most any grocery store. By rubbing some of this between\r\nthe fingers, both dry and wet, one can get a fair idea of how a silty\r\nsoil should feel. Silt when wet is sticky like clay.\r\n\r\n_Clay._--The finest of rock particles, 1/5000 to 1/250000 of an inch\r\nin diameter, too small to imagine. Clay when wet is very soft,\r\nslippery and very sticky. Yellow ochre and whiting from the paint shop\r\nare good illustrations of clay.\r\n\r\n_Humus_, or decaying vegetable and animal matter. This is dark brown\r\nor almost black in color--decaying leaves and woods soil are examples.\r\n\r\nSoils composed of the above materials:\r\n\r\n_Sands or Sandy Soils._--These soils are mixtures of the different\r\ngrades of sand and small amounts of silt, clay and organic matter.\r\nThey are light, loose and easy to work. They produce early crops, and\r\nare particularly adapted to early truck, fruit and bright tobacco, but\r\nare too light for general farm crops. To this class belongs the\r\nso-called Norfolk Sand. This is a coarse to medium, yellow or brown\r\nsand averaging about five-sixths sand and one-sixth silt and clay and\r\nis a typical early truck soil found all along the eastern coast of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"It is a mealy, porous, warm sand, well drained and easily cultivated.\r\nIn regions where trucking forms an important part of agriculture, this\r\nsoil is sought out as best adapted to the production of watermelons,\r\ncanteloupes, sweet potatoes, early Irish potatoes, strawberries, early\r\ntomatoes, early peas, peppers, egg plant, rhubarb and even cabbage and\r\ncauliflower, though the latter crops produce better yields on a\r\nheavier soil.\"\r\n\r\nA very similar sand in the central part of the country is called Miami\r\nSand and, on the Pacific Coast, Fresno Sand. These names are given to\r\nthese type soils by the Bureau of Soils of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n_Loams or Loamy Soils_, consist of mixtures of the sands, silt and\r\nclay with some organic matter. The term loam is applied to a soil\r\nwhich, from its appearance in the field and the feeling when handled,\r\nappears to be about one-half sand and the other half silt and clay\r\nwith more or less organic matter. These are naturally fine in texture\r\nand quite sticky when wet. They would be called clay by many on\r\naccount of their stickiness. They are good soils for general farming\r\nand produce good grain, grass, corn, potatoes, cotton, vegetables,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Sandy Loams_, averaging about three-fifths sand and two-fifths silt\r\nand clay. These soils are tilled easily and are the lightest desirable\r\nsoil for general farming. They are particularly adapted to corn and\r\ncotton and in some instances are used for small fruits and truck\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n_Silt Loam_ consists largely of silt with a small amount of sand,\r\nclay, and organic matter. These soils are some of the most difficult\r\nto till, but when well drained they are with careful management good\r\ngeneral farming soils, producing good corn, wheat, oats, potatoes,\r\nalfalfa and fair cotton.\r\n\r\n_Clay Loams._--These soils contain more clay than the silt loams. They\r\nare stiff, sticky soils, and some of them are difficult to till. They\r\nare generally considered the strongest soils for general farming. They\r\nare particularly adapted to wheat, hay, corn and grass.\r\n\r\n_Gravelly loams_ are from one-fourth to two-thirds coarse grained; the\r\nremaining fine soil may be sandy loam, silt or clay loam. They are\r\nadapted to various crops according to the character of the fine soil.\r\nSome of them are best planted to fruit and forest.\r\n\r\n_Stony Loam._--Like the gravelly loam the stony loams are one-fourth\r\nto three-fourths sandy, silty or clay loam, the remainder being rock\r\nfragments of larger size than the gravel. These fragments are\r\nsometimes rough and irregular and sometimes rounded. The stones\r\ninterfere seriously with tillage, and naturally the soils are best\r\nplanted with forest or fruit.\r\n\r\n_Clay Soils._--Clay soils are mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus,\r\nthe clay existing in quite large quantities, there being a greater\r\npreponderance of the clay characteristics than in the clay loams; they\r\nare very heavy, sticky, and difficult to manage. Some clay soils are\r\nnot worth farming. Those that can be profitably tilled are adapted to\r\nwheat, corn, hay and pasture.\r\n\r\n_Adobe Soils._--These are peculiar soils of the dry West. They are\r\nmixtures of clay, silt, some sand and large amounts of humus. Their\r\npeculiar characteristic is that they are very sticky when wet and bake\r\nvery hard when dry and are, therefore, very difficult to manage,\r\nthough they are generally very productive when they are moist enough\r\nto support crops.\r\n\r\n_Swamp Muck_ is a dark brown or black swamp soil consisting of large\r\namounts of humus or decaying organic matter mixed with some fine sand\r\nand clay. It is found in low wet places.\r\n\r\n_Peat_ is also largely vegetable matter, consisting of tough roots,\r\npartially decayed leaves, moss, etc. It is quite dense and compact and\r\nin some regions is used for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WERE SOILS MADE?\r\n\r\nAs a help in finding the answer to this question collect and examine a\r\nnumber of the following or similar specimens:\r\n\r\n_Brick._--Take pieces of brick and rub them together. A fine powder or\r\ndust will be the result.\r\n\r\n_Stones._--Rub together pieces of stone; the same result will follow,\r\nexcept that the dust will be finer and will be produced with greater\r\ndifficulty because the stones are harder. Some stones will be found\r\nwhich will grind others without being much affected themselves.\r\n\r\n_Rock Salt or Cattle Salt._--This is a soft rock, easily broken. Place\r\non a slate or platter one or two pieces about the size of an egg or\r\nthe size of your fist. Slowly drop water on them till it runs down and\r\npartly covers the slate, then set away till the water dries up. Fine\r\nparticles of salt will be found on the slate wherever the water ran\r\nand dried. This is because the water dissolved some of the rock.\r\n\r\n_Lime Stone._--This is harder. Crush two samples to a fine powder and\r\nplace one in water and the other in vinegar. Water has apparently no\r\neffect on it, but small bubbles are seen to rise from the sample in\r\nvinegar. The vinegar which is a weak acid is slowly dissolving the\r\nrock. The chemists tell us water will also dissolve the limestone, but\r\nvery slowly. There are large areas of soil which are the refuse from\r\nthe dissolving of great masses of limestone.\r\n\r\nWe find that the rocks about us differ in hardness: they are ground to\r\npowder when rubbed together, some are easily dissolved in water,\r\nothers are dissolved by weak acids.\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that the whole crust of the earth was at one time\r\nmade up of rocks, part of which have been broken down into coarse and\r\nfine particles which form the gravel, sand and clay of our soils. The\r\norganic matter of our soils has been added by the decay of plants and\r\nanimals. Several agencies have been active in this work of breaking\r\ndown the rocks and making soils of them. If we look about we can\r\nperhaps see some of this work going on now.\r\n\r\n_Work of the Sun._--Examine a crockery plate or dish that has been\r\nmany times in and out of a hot oven, noticing the little cracks all\r\nover its surface. Most substances expand when they are heated and\r\ncontract when they are cooled. When the plate is placed in the oven\r\nthe surface heats faster than the inner parts, and cools faster when\r\ntaken out of the oven. The result is that there is unequal expansion\r\nand contraction in the plate and consequently tension or pulling of\r\nits parts against each other. The weaker part gives way and a crack\r\nappears. If hot water is put into a thick glass tumbler or bottle, the\r\ninner surface heats and expands faster than the outer parts and the\r\nresult is tension and cracking. If cold water be poured on a warm\r\nbottle or piece of warm glass, it cracks, because there is unequal\r\ncontraction. In the early part of a bright sunny afternoon feel of the\r\nsurface of exposed rocks, bricks, boards, or buildings on which the\r\nsun has been shining. Examine them in the same way early the next\r\nmorning. You will find that the rocks are heated by the sun just as\r\nthe plate was heated when put into the oven, and when the sun goes\r\ndown the rocks cool again. This causes tension in the rocks and\r\nlittle cracks and checks appear in them just as in the heated plate,\r\nonly more slowly. This checking may also be brought about by a cool\r\nshower falling on the sun heated rocks just as the cool water cracked\r\nthe warm glass. Many rocks if examined closely will be found to be\r\ncomposed of several materials. These materials do not expand and\r\ncontract alike when heated and cooled and the tendency for them to\r\ncheck is greater even than that of the plate. This is the case with\r\nmost rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--COMPARING SOILS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--WATER TEST OF SOILS.\r\nBottle _A_ contains sand and water, bottle _B_ clay and water. The\r\nsand settles quickly, the clay very slowly.]\r\n\r\n_Work of Rain._--Rain falling on the rocks may dissolve a part of them\r\njust as it dissolved the rock salt; or, working into the small cracks\r\nmade by the sun, may wash out loosened particles; or, during cold\r\nweather it may freeze in the cracks and by its expansion chip off\r\nsmall pieces; or, getting into large cracks and freezing, may split\r\nthe rock just as freezing water splits a water pitcher or the water\r\npipes.\r\n\r\n_Work of Moving Water._--Visit some neighboring beach or the banks of\r\nsome rapid stream. See how the waves are rolling the sand and pebbles\r\nup and down the beach, grinding them together, rounding their corners\r\nand edges, throwing them up into sand beds, and carrying off the finer\r\nparticles to deposit elsewhere. Now visit a quiet cove or inlet and\r\nsee how the quiet water is laying down the fine particles, making a\r\nclay bed. Notice also how the water plants along the border are\r\nhelping. They act as an immense strainer, collecting the suspended\r\nparticles from the water, and with them and their bodies building beds\r\nof soil rich in organic matter or humus.\r\n\r\nThe sun, besides expanding and cracking the rocks by its heat, helps\r\nin another way to make soils. It warms the water that has been\r\ngrinding soil on the beach or along the river banks and causes some of\r\nit to evaporate. This vapor rises, forms a cloud and floats away in\r\nthe air. By and by the vapor forms into rain drops which may fall on\r\nthe top of some mountain. These rain drops may wash loosened particles\r\nfrom the surface or crevices of exposed rocks. These drops are joined\r\nby others until, by and by, they form a little stream which carries\r\nits small burden of rock dust down the slope, now dropping some\r\nparticles, now taking up others. Other little streams join this one\r\nuntil they form a brook which increases in size and power as it\r\ndescends the mountain side. As it grows by the addition of other\r\nstreams it picks up larger pieces, grinds them together, grinds at its\r\nbanks and loads itself with rocks, pebbles, sand and clay. As the\r\nstream reaches the lower part of the mountain where the slope is less\r\nsteep, it is checked in its course and the larger stones and pebbles\r\nare dropped while the sand and finer particles are carried on and\r\ndeposited on the bottom of some broad quiet river farther down, and\r\nwhen the river overflows its banks, are distributed over the\r\nneighboring meadows, giving them a new coating of soil and often\r\nadding to their fertility. What a river does not leave along its\r\ncourse it carries out to sea to help build the sand bars and mud flats\r\nthere. The rain drops have now gotten back to the beach where they\r\ntake up again the work of grinding the soil.\r\n\r\nThe work of moving water can be seen in almost any road or cultivated\r\nfield during or just after a rain, and particularly on the hillsides,\r\nwhere often the soil is loosened and carried from higher to lower\r\nparts, making barren sand and clay banks of fertile hillsides and\r\ndestroying the fertility of the bottom lands below.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the work of freezing water in splitting small\r\nand large fragments from the rocks. Water moving over the surface of\r\nthe earth in a solid form, or ice, was at an earlier period in the\r\nhistory of the earth one of the most powerful agencies in soil\r\nformation. Away up in Greenland and on the northern border of this\r\ncontinent the temperature is so low that most if not all of the\r\nmoisture that falls on the earth falls as snow. This snow has piled up\r\nuntil it has become very deep and very heavy. The great weight has\r\npacked the bottom of this great snow bank to ice. On the mountains\r\nwhere the land was not level the masses of snow and ice, centuries\r\nago, began to slide down the slopes and finally formed great rivers of\r\nsolid water or moving ice.\r\n\r\nThe geologists tell us that at one time a great river of ice extended\r\nfrom the Arctic region as far south as central Pennsylvania and from\r\nNew England to the Rocky Mountains. This vast river was very deep and\r\nvery heavy and into its under surface were frozen sand, pebbles,\r\nlarger stones and even great rocks. Thus it acted as a great rasp or\r\nfile and did an immense amount of work grinding rocks and making\r\nsoils. It ground down mountains and carried great beds of soil from\r\none place to another. When this great ice river melted, it dropped its\r\nload of rocks and soils, and as a result we find in that region of the\r\ncountry great boulders and beds of sand and clay scattered over the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Work of the Air._--The air has helped in the work of wearing down the\r\nrocks and making soils. If a piece of iron be exposed to moist air a\r\npart of the air unites with part of the iron and forms iron rust. In\r\nthe same way when moist air comes in contact with some rocks part of\r\nthe air unites with part of the rock and forms rock rust which\r\ncrumbles off or is washed away by water. Thus the air helps to break\r\ndown the rocks. Moving air or wind picks up dust particles and carries\r\nthem from one field to another. On sandy beaches the wind often blows\r\nthe sand along like snow and piles it into drifts. The entire surface\r\nof sandy regions is sometimes changed in this way. Sands blown from\r\ndeserts sometimes bury forests which with their foliage sift the fatal\r\nwinding sheet from the dust-laden winds.\r\n\r\n_The Work of Plants._--Living plants sometimes send their roots into\r\nrock crevices; there they grow, expand, and split off rock fragments.\r\nCertain kinds of plants live on the surface of rocks. They feed on\r\nthe rocks and when they die and decay they keep the surface of the\r\nrocks moist and also produce carbonic acid which dissolves the rocks\r\nslowly just as the vinegar dissolved the limestone in our experiment.\r\n\r\nDead decaying roots, stems, and leaves of plants form largely the\r\norganic matter of the soil. When organic matter has undergone a\r\ncertain amount of decay it is called humus, and these soils are called\r\norganic soils or humus soils. The black soils of the woods, swamps and\r\nprairies, contain large amounts of humus.\r\n\r\n_Work of Animals._--Earth worms and the larvæ of insects which burrow\r\nin the soil eat soil particles which pass through their bodies and are\r\npartially dissolved. These particles are generally cast out on the\r\nsurface of the soil. Thus these little animals help to move soil, to\r\ndissolve soil, and to open up passages for the entrance of air and\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL TEXTURE\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the soil particles vary in size and that for the\r\nbest development of the plant the particles of the soil must be so\r\narranged that the delicate rootlets can readily push their way about\r\nin search of food, or, in other words, that the soil must have a\r\ncertain texture. By the texture of the soil we mean the size of its\r\nparticles and their relation to each other. The following terms are\r\nused in describing soil textures: Coarse, fine, open, close, loose,\r\nhard, stiff, compact, soft, mellow, porous, leachy, retentive, cloddy,\r\nlumpy, light, heavy. Which of these terms will apply to the texture of\r\nsand, which to clay, which to humus, which to the garden soil, which\r\nto a soil that plant roots can easily penetrate? We find then that\r\ntexture of the soil depends largely on the relative amounts of sand,\r\nsilt, clay and humus that it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRELATION OF SOILS TO WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF WATER TO PLANTS\r\n\r\nWe learned in a previous paragraph that plant roots take moisture from\r\nthe soil. What becomes of this moisture? We will answer this question\r\nwith an experiment.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take a pot or tumbler in which a young plant is\r\ngrowing, also a piece of pasteboard large enough to cover the top of\r\nthe pot or tumbler; cut a slit from the edge to the centre of the\r\nboard, then place it on top of the pot, letting the stem of the plant\r\nenter the slit. Now close the slit with wax or tallow, making it\r\nperfectly tight about the stem. If the plant is not too large invert a\r\ntumbler over it (Fig. 21), letting the edge of the tumbler rest on the\r\npasteboard; if a tumbler is not large enough use a glass jar. Place in\r\na sunny window. Moisture will be seen collecting on the inner surface\r\nof the glass. Where does this come from? It is absorbed from the soil\r\nby the roots of the plant and is sent with its load of dissolved plant\r\nfood up through the stem to the leaves. There most of the moisture is\r\npassed from the leaves to the air and some of it is condensed on the\r\nside of the glass.\r\n\r\nBy experiments at the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, Ithaca, N.Y., it has been found that during the growth of a\r\nsixty bushel crop of corn the plants pump from the soil by means of\r\ntheir roots, and send into the air through their leaves over nine\r\nhundred tons of water. A twenty-five bushel crop of wheat uses over\r\nfive hundred tons of water in the same way. This gives us some idea of\r\nthe importance of water to the plant and the necessity of knowing\r\nsomething of the power of the soil to absorb and hold moisture for the\r\nuse of the plant. Also the importance of knowing if we can in any way\r\ncontrol or influence the water-holding power of the soil for the good\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nFrom what sources does the soil receive water? From the air above, in\r\nthe form of rain, dew, hail and snow, falling on the surface, and from\r\nthe lower soil. This water enters the soil more or less rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE SOILS TOWARDS WATER\r\n\r\nWhich soils have the greater power to take in the rain which falls on\r\ntheir surface?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.\r\nTo show what becomes of the water taken from the soil by roots.\r\nMoisture, sent up from the roots, has been given off by the leaves and\r\nhas condensed on the glass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--PERCOLATION EXPERIMENT.\r\nTo show the relative powers of soils to take in water falling on the\r\nsurface. _A_, sand; _B_, clay; _C_, humus; _D_, garden soil.]\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take four student-lamp chimneys. (In case the chimneys\r\ncannot be found get some slender bottles like salad oil bottles or\r\nwine bottles and cut the bottoms off with a hot rod. While the rod\r\nis heating make a shallow notch in the glass with the wet corner of a\r\nfile in the direction you wish to make the cut. When the rod is hot\r\nlay the end of it lengthwise on the notch. Very soon a little crack\r\nwill be seen to start from the notch. Lead this crack around the\r\nbottle with the hot rod and the bottom of the bottle will drop off.)\r\n(Fig. 23.) Make a rack to hold them. Tie a piece of cheese cloth or\r\nother thin cloth over the small ends of the chimneys. Then fill them\r\nnearly full respectively, of dry, sifted, coarse sand, clay, humus\r\nsoil, and garden soil. Place them in the rack; place under them a pan\r\nor dish. Pour water in the upper ends of the tubes until it soaks\r\nthrough and drips from the lower end (Fig. 22). Ordinary sunburner\r\nlamp chimneys may be used for the experiment by tying the cloth over\r\nthe tops; then invert them, fill them with soil and set in plates or\r\npans. The sand will take the water in and let it run through quickly;\r\nthe clay is very slow to take it in and let it run through; the humus\r\nsoil takes the water in quite readily. Repeat the experiment with one\r\nof the soils, packing the soil tightly in one tube and leaving it\r\nloose in another. The water will be found to penetrate the loose soil\r\nmore rapidly than the packed soil. We see then that the power of the\r\nsoil to take in rainfall depends on its texture or the size and\r\ncompactness of the particles.\r\n\r\nIf the soil of our farm is largely clay, what happens to the rain that\r\nfalls on it? The clay takes the water in so slowly that most of it\r\nruns off and is lost. Very likely it carries with it some of the\r\nsurface soil which it has soaked and loosened, and thus leaves the\r\nfarm washed and gullied.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do for our clay soils to help them to absorb the rain more\r\nrapidly? For immediate results we can plow them and keep them loose\r\nand open with the tillage tools. For more permanent results we may mix\r\nsand with them, but sand is not always to be obtained and is expensive\r\nto haul. The best method is to mix organic matter with them by plowing\r\nin stable manures, or woods soil, or decayed leaves, or by growing\r\ncrops and turning them under. The organic matter not only loosens the\r\nsoil but also adds plant food to it, and during its decay produces\r\ncarbonic acid which helps to dissolve the mineral matter and make\r\navailable the plant food that is in it.\r\n\r\nClay soils can also be made loose and open by applying lime to them.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take two bottles or jars, put therein a few spoonsful\r\nof clay soil, fill with water, put a little lime in one of them, shake\r\nboth and set them on the table. It will be noticed that the clay in\r\nthe bottle containing lime settles in flakes or crumbs, and much\r\nfaster than in the other bottle. In the same manner, lime applied to a\r\nfield of clay has a tendency to collect the very fine particles of\r\nsoil into flakes or crumbs and give it somewhat the open texture of a\r\nsandy soil. Lime is applied to soil for this purpose at the rate of\r\ntwenty bushels per acre once in four or five years.\r\n\r\nWhich soils have the greater power to absorb or pump moisture from\r\nbelow?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Use the same or a similar set of tubes as in the\r\nexperiment illustrated in Fig. 23. Fill the tubes with the same kinds\r\nof dry sifted soils. Then pour water into the pan or dish beneath the\r\ntubes until it rises a quarter of an inch above the lower end of the\r\ntubes (Fig. 24). Watch the water rise in the soils. The water will be\r\nfound to rise rapidly in the sand about two or three inches and then\r\nstop or continue very slowly a short distance further. In the clay it\r\nstarts very slowly, but after several hours is finally carried to the\r\ntop of the soil. The organic matter takes it up less rapidly than the\r\nsand, faster than the clay, and finally carries it to the top. By this\r\nand further experiments it will be found that the power of soils to\r\ntake moisture from below depends on their texture or the size and\r\ncloseness of their particles.\r\n\r\nWe found the sand pumped the water only a short distance and then\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do for our sandy soils to give them greater power to take\r\nmoisture from below? For immediate results we can compact them by\r\nrolling or packing. This brings the particles closer together, makes\r\nthe spaces between them smaller, and therefore allows the water to\r\nclimb higher. For more lasting results we can fill them with organic\r\nmatter in the shape of stable manures or crops turned under. Clay may\r\nbe used, but is expensive to haul.\r\n\r\nWhich soils have greatest power to hold the water which enters them?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Use the same or similar apparatus as for the last\r\nexperiment. After placing the cloth caps over the ends of the tubes\r\nlabel and carefully weigh each one, keeping a record of each; then\r\nfill them with the dry soils and weigh again. Now place the tubes in\r\nthe rack and pour water in the upper ends until the entire soil is\r\nwet; cover the tops and allow the surplus water to drain out; when the\r\ndripping stops, weigh the tubes again, and by subtraction find the\r\namount of water held by the soil in each tube; compute the percentage.\r\nIt will be found that the organic matter will hold a much larger\r\npercentage of water than the other soils; and the clay more than the\r\nsand. The tube of organic soil will actually hold a larger amount of\r\nwater than the other tubes. (See also Fig. 25.)\r\n\r\nIn the experiment on page 40 we noticed that the sand took in the\r\nwater poured on its surface and let it run through very quickly. This\r\nis a fault of sandy soils.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do for our sandy soils to help them to hold better the\r\nmoisture which falls on them and tends to leach through them? For\r\nimmediate effect we can close the pores somewhat by compacting the\r\nsoil with the roller. For more lasting effects, we can fill them with\r\norganic matter.\r\n\r\nWhich soils will hold longest the water which they have absorbed? Or\r\nwhich soils will keep moist longest in dry weather?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\nTo show how bottles may be used in place of lamp chimneys shown in\r\nFigs 22 and 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--CAPILLARITY OF SOILS\r\nTo show the relative powers of soils to take water from below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--WATER-ABSORBING AND WATER-HOLDING POWERS OF\r\nSOILS.]\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Fill a pan or bucket with moist sand, another with\r\nmoist clay, and a third with moist organic matter; set them in the sun\r\nto dry and notice which dries last. The organic matter will be found\r\nto hold moisture much longer than the other soils. The power of the\r\nother soils to hold moisture through dry weather can be improved by\r\nmixing organic matter with them.\r\n\r\nWe find then that the power of soils to absorb and hold moisture\r\ndepends on the amount of sand, clay, or humus which they contain, and\r\nthe compactness of the particles. We see also how useful organic\r\nmatter is in improving sandy and clayey soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF WORKING SOILS WHEN WET\r\n\r\nBy this time the soils we left in the pans (see page 26), sand, clay,\r\nhumus and garden soil, must be dry. If so, examine them. We find that\r\nthe clay which was stirred when wet has dried into an almost bricklike\r\nmass, while that which was not stirred is not so hard, though it has a\r\nthick, hard crust. The sand is not much affected by stirring when wet.\r\nThe organic matter which was stirred when wet has perhaps stiffened a\r\nlittle, but very easily crumbles; the unstirred part was not much\r\naffected by the wetting and drying.\r\n\r\nThe garden soil after drying is not as stiff as the clay nor as loose\r\nas the sand and humus. This is because it is very likely a mixture of\r\nall three, the sand and the humus checking the baking. This teaches\r\nus that it is not a good plan to work soils when they are wet if they\r\nare stiff and sticky; and that our stiff clay soils can be kept from\r\ndrying hard or baking by the use of organic matter. \"And that's a\r\nwitness\" for organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the soil to moisture is very important, for moisture\r\nis one of the greatest factors if not the greatest in the growth of\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nThe power to absorb or soak up moisture from any source is greatest in\r\nthose soils whose particles are smaller and fit closer together.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that strong loams and clay soils absorb and hold\r\nthree times as much water as sandy soils do, while peaty or humus\r\nsoils absorb a still larger proportion.\r\n\r\nThe reason why crops burn up so quickly on sandy soils during dry\r\nseasons is because of their weak power to hold water.\r\n\r\nThe clay and humus soils carry crops through dry weather better\r\nbecause of their power to hold moisture and to absorb or soak up\r\nmoisture from below. It is for this reason also that clay and peaty\r\nsoils more often need draining than sandy soils.\r\n\r\nWhen rain falls on a sandy soil it enters readily, but it is apt to\r\npass rapidly down and be, to a great extent, lost in the subsoil, for\r\nthe sand has not sufficient power to hold much of it.\r\n\r\nWhen rain falls on a clay soil it enters less readily because of the\r\ncloseness of the particles, and during long rains or heavy showers\r\nsome of the water may run off the surface. If the surface has been\r\nrecently broken and softened with the plow or cultivator the rain\r\nenters more readily. What does enter is held and is not allowed to run\r\nthrough as in the case of the sand.\r\n\r\nHumus soil absorbs the rain as readily as the sand and holds it with a\r\nfirmer grip than clay.\r\n\r\nThis fact gives us a hint as to how we may improve the sand and clay.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter mixed with these soils by applying manures or plowing\r\nunder green crops will cause the sand to hold the rain better and the\r\nclay to absorb it more readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORMS OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nWater which comes to the soil and is absorbed exists in the soil\r\nprincipally in two forms: Free water and capillary water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE WATER\r\n\r\nFree water is that form of water which fills our wells, is found in\r\nthe bottoms of holes dug in the ground during wet seasons and is often\r\nfound standing on the surface of the soil after heavy or long\r\ncontinued rains. It is sometimes called ground water or standing water\r\nand flows under the influence of gravity.\r\n\r\nIs free water good for the roots of farm plants? If we remember how\r\nthe root takes its food and moisture, namely through the delicate root\r\nhairs; and also remember the experiment which showed us that roots\r\nneed air, we can readily see that free water would give the root hairs\r\nenough moisture, but it would at the same time drown them by cutting\r\noff the air. Therefore free water is not directly useful to the roots\r\nof house plants or farm plants, excepting such as are naturally\r\nswamp plants, like rice, which grows part of the time with its\r\nroots covered with free water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--CAPILLARY TUBES.\r\nTo show how water rises in small tubes or is drawn into small spaces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--CAPILLARY PLATES.\r\nWater is drawn to the highest point where the glass plates are closest\r\ntogether.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.\r\nA cone of soil to show capillarity. Water poured about the base of\r\nthis cone of soil has been drawn by capillary force half-way to the\r\ntop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.\r\nTo show the relative amounts of film-moisture held by coarse and fine\r\nsoils. The colored water in bottle _A_ represents the amount of water\r\nrequired to cover the half pound of pebbles in the tumbler _B_ with a\r\nfilm of moisture. The colored water in bottle _C_ shows the amount\r\nrequired to cover the soil grains in the half pound of sand in tumbler\r\n_D._]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPILLARY WATER\r\n\r\nIf you will take a number of glass tubes of different sizes, the\r\nlargest not more than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and hold them\r\nwith one end of each in water or some colored liquid, you will notice\r\nthat the water rises in the tubes (Fig. 26), and that it rises highest\r\nin the smallest tube. The force which causes the water to rise in\r\nthese tubes is called the capillary force, from the old Latin word\r\n_capillum_ (a hair), because it is most marked in hair-like tubes, the\r\nsmaller the tube the higher the water will rise. The water which rises\r\nin the tubes is called capillary water.\r\n\r\nAnother method of illustrating capillary water is to tie or hold\r\ntogether two flat pieces of glass, keeping two of the edges close\r\ntogether and separating the opposite two about one-eighth of an inch\r\nwith a sliver of wood. Then set them in a plate of water or colored\r\nliquid and notice how the water rises between the pieces of glass,\r\nrising higher the smaller the space (Fig. 27). It is the capillary\r\nforce which causes water to rise in a piece of cloth or paper dipped\r\nin water.\r\n\r\nTake a plate and pour onto it a cone-shaped pile of dry sand or fine\r\nsoil; then pour water around the base of the pile and note how the\r\nwater is drawn up into the soil by capillary force (Fig. 28).\r\n\r\nCapillary water is the other important form of water in the soil. This\r\nis moisture which is drawn by capillary force or soaks into the spaces\r\nbetween the soil particles and covers each particle with a thin film\r\nof moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILM WATER\r\n\r\nTake a marble or a pebble, dip it into water and notice the thin layer\r\nor film of water that clings to it. This is a form of capillary water\r\nand is sometimes called film water or film moisture. Take a handful of\r\nsoil that is moist but not wet, notice that it does not wet the hand,\r\nand yet there is moisture all through it; each particle is covered\r\nwith a very thin film of water.\r\n\r\nNow this film water is just the form of water that can supply the very\r\nslender root hairs without drowning them, that is, without keeping the\r\nair from them. And the plant grower should see to it that the roots of\r\nhis plants are well supplied with film water and are not drowned by\r\nthe presence of free water. Capillary water may sometimes completely\r\nfill the spaces between the soil particles; when this occurs the roots\r\nare drowned just as in the case of free water as we saw when cuttings\r\nwere placed in the puddled clay (see Fig. 18). Free water is\r\nindirectly of use to the plant because it serves as a supply for\r\ncapillary and film moisture.\r\n\r\nNow I think we can answer the question which was asked when we were\r\nstudying the habit of growth of roots but was left unanswered at the\r\ntime (see page 14). The question was this: Of what value is it to the\r\nfarmer to know that roots enter the soil to a depth of three to six\r\nfeet? We know that roots will not grow without air. We also know that\r\nif the soil is full of free water there is no air in it, and,\r\ntherefore, roots of most plants will not grow in it. It is, therefore,\r\nof interest to the farmer to see that free water does not come within\r\nat least three or four feet of the surface of the soil so that the\r\nroots of his crops may have plenty of well ventilated soil in which to\r\ndevelop. If there is a tendency for free water to fill the soil a\r\nlarge part of the time, the farmer can get rid of it by draining the\r\nland. We get here a lesson for the grower of house plants also. It is\r\nthat we must be careful that the soil in the pots or boxes in which\r\nour plants are growing is always supplied with film water and not wet\r\nand soggy with free water. Water should not be left standing long in\r\nthe saucer under the pot of a growing plant. It is best to water the\r\npot from the top and let the surplus water drain into the saucer and\r\nthen empty it out.\r\n\r\nWhich soils have the greatest capacity for film water?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Place in a tumbler or bottle one-half pound of pebbles\r\nabout the size of a pea or bean; pour a few drops of water on them and\r\nshake them; continue adding water and shaking them till every pebble\r\nis covered with a film of water; let any surplus water drain off. Then\r\nweigh again; the difference in the two weights will be approximately\r\nthe weight of the film water that the pebbles can carry. Repeat this\r\nwith sand and compare the two amounts of water. A striking\r\nillustration can be made by taking two slender bottles and placing in\r\nthem amounts of colored water equal to the amounts of film water held\r\nby the pebbles and sand respectively. In the accompanying illustration\r\n(Fig. 29), _A_ represents the amount of water that was found necessary\r\nto cover the pebbles in tumbler _B_ with a film of moisture. _C_ is\r\nthe amount that was necessary to cover with a film the particles of\r\nsand in _D_. The finer soil has the greater area for film moisture. It\r\nhas been estimated that the particles of a cubic foot of clay loam\r\nhave a possible aggregate film surface of three-fourths of an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLOSS OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF SOIL WATER AND MEANS OF CHECKING THE LOSS\r\n\r\nWe noticed in previous paragraphs that soil might at times have too\r\nmuch water in it for proper ventilation and so check the growth of the\r\nroots of the plant. Now is it possible that soil water may be lost or\r\nwasted and if so can we check the loss?\r\n\r\nIn the experiment to find out how well the soils would take in the\r\nrainfall (page 40) we noticed that the clay soil took in the water\r\nvery slowly and that on a field of clay soil part of the rain water\r\nwould be likely to run off over the surface and be lost. Free water\r\nmay be lost then, by surface wash.\r\n\r\nWe noticed methods of checking this loss, namely, pulverizing the soil\r\nwith the tillage tools and putting organic matter into it to make it\r\nabsorb the rain more readily.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that water poured on the sand ran through it very quickly\r\nand was apt to be lost by leaching or percolation. This we found could\r\nbe checked by rolling the soil and by putting organic matter into it\r\nto close the pores.\r\n\r\nWe learned that roots take water from the soil for the use of the\r\nplant and send it up to the leaves, which in turn send it out into the\r\nair, or transpire it, as this process is called. We learned also that\r\nthe amount transpired is very great. Now water that is pumped up and\r\ntranspired by the crops we are growing we consider properly used. But\r\nwhen weeds grow with the crop and pump and transpire water we consider\r\nthis water as lost or wasted.\r\n\r\nWater may be lost then by being pumped up and transpired by weeds. And\r\nthis is the way weeds do their greatest injury to crops during dry\r\nweather. The remedy is easily pointed out. Kill the weeds or do not\r\nlet them get a start.\r\n\r\nThere is another way, which we are not apt to notice, by which water\r\nmay be lost from the soil. When the soil in the pans in a previous\r\nexperiment (page 26) had been wet and set aside a few days it became\r\nvery dry. How did the water get out of this soil? That at the surface\r\nof the soil evaporated or was changed into vapor and passed into the\r\nair. Then water from below the surface was pumped up by capillary\r\nforce to take its place just as the water was pumped up in the tubes\r\nof soil. This in turn was evaporated and the process repeated till all\r\nof the water in the soil had passed into the air. Now this process is\r\ngoing on in the field whenever it is not raining or the ground is not\r\nfrozen very hard.\r\n\r\nWater then may be lost by evaporation.\r\n\r\nHow can we check this loss?\r\n\r\nSuppose we try the experiment of covering the soil with some material\r\nthat cannot pump water readily.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take four glass fruit jars, two-quart size, with\r\nstraight sides. If you cannot get them with straight sides cut off the\r\ntops with a hot iron just below the shoulder; tin pails will do if the\r\nglass jars cannot be had. Fill these with moist soil from the field or\r\ngarden, packing it till it is as hard as the unplowed or unspaded\r\nsoil. Leave one of them in this condition; from two of them remove an\r\ninch or two of soil and replace it in the case of one with clean, dry,\r\ncoarse sand, and in the case of the other with chaff or straw cut into\r\nhalf-inch lengths. Stir the soil in the fourth one to a depth of one\r\ninch, leaving it light and crumbly. Now weigh the jars and set them\r\naside. Weigh each day for several days. The four jars illustrated in\r\nFig. 30 were prepared in this way and allowed to stand seven days. In\r\nthat time they lost the following amounts of water:\r\n\r\nAmounts of water lost from jars of prepared soil in seven days.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 packed soil--lost 5.5 oz. equal to about 75 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 covered with straw--lost 2 oz. equal to about 27 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 covered with dry sand--lost 0 oz. equal to about tons per acre.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 covered with crumbled soil--lost 2.5 oz., equal to about 34 tons\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nWhy did not 2, 3 and 4 lose as much water as No. 1?\r\n\r\nThe soil in jar No. 1 was packed and water was pumped to the surface\r\nby capillary force and was evaporated as fast as it came to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn No. 2 the water could rise rapidly until it reached the straw, then\r\nit was stopped almost entirely. But the straw being coarse, the air\r\ncirculated in it more or less freely and there was a slow loss by\r\nevaporation. In jar No. 3 the water could rise only to the sand, which\r\nwas so coarse that the water could not climb on it to the surface, and\r\nthe air circulated in the sand so slowly that there was not sufficient\r\nevaporation to affect scales weighing to one-quarter ounce. No. 4 lost\r\nless than No. 1 because, as in the case of the sand, the water could\r\nnot climb rapidly to the surface on the coarse crumbs of soil. The\r\nloss that did take place from No. 4 was what the air took from the\r\nloosely stirred soil on the surface with a very little from the lower\r\nsoil. Simply stirring the surface of the sod in No. 4 reduced the loss\r\nof water to less than half the loss from the hard soil in No. 1.\r\n\r\nThis experiment gives us the clew to the method of checking loss of\r\nwater from the soil by evaporation. It is to keep the water from\r\nclimbing up to the surface, or check the power of the soil to pump the\r\nwater to the surface by making it loose on top. This loose soil is\r\ncalled a soil mulch. Everything that we do to the soil that loosens\r\nand crumbles the surface tends to check the loss of water by\r\nevaporation from the soil below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF A SOIL MULCH\r\n1. Packed soil, lost in 7 days 5.5 ozs. water, equal to 75 tons per\r\nacre.\r\n2. Packed soil, covered with straw, lost in 7 days 2 ozs. water, equal\r\nto 27 tons per acre.\r\n3. Packed soil, covered with sand, lost in 7 days 0 ozs. water, equal to\r\ntons per acre.\r\n4. Packed soil, covered with soil mulch, lost in 7 days 2.5 ozs.\r\nwater, equal to 34 tons per acre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOIL TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learned that roots need heat for their growth and development. Now\r\nwhat is the relation of the different kinds of soil toward heat or\r\nwhat are their relative powers to absorb and hold heat?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Some days before this experiment, spread on a dry floor\r\nabout a half bushel each of sand, clay and decayed leaf mould or black\r\nwoods soil. Stir them occasionally till they are thoroughly dry. When\r\nthey are dry place them separately in three boxes or large flower pots\r\nand keep dry. In three similar boxes or pots place wet sand, wet clay,\r\nand wet humus. Place a thermometer in each of the soils, placing the\r\nbulb between one and two inches below the surface (Fig. 31). Then\r\nplace the soils out of doors where the sun can shine on them and leave\r\nthem several days. If a rain should come up protect the dry soils.\r\nObserve and make a record of the temperatures of each soil several\r\ntimes a day. Chart the average of several days observations. Fig. 32\r\nshows the averages of several days observations on a certain set of\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the temperature of the soils increased until\r\nthe early part of the afternoon and after that time they lost heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--SOIL TEMPERATURE EXPERIMENT.\r\nThermometer in pot of soil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SOILS ARE WARMED\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Hold your hand in bright sunlight or near a warm stove\r\nor radiator. Your hand is warmed by heat radiated from the sun or warm\r\nstove through the air to your body. In the same manner the rays of the\r\nsun heat the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take the stove poker or any small iron rod and hold one\r\nend of it in the fire or hold one end of a piece of wire in a candle\r\nor lamp flame. The end of the rod or wire will quickly become very hot\r\nand heat will gradually be carried its entire length until it becomes\r\ntoo hot to hold. This carrying of the heat from particle to particle\r\nthrough the length of the rod is called heating by conduction. Now\r\nwhen the warm rays of the sun reach the soil, or a warm wind blows\r\nover it, the surface particles are warmed and then pass the heat on to\r\nthe next ones below, and these in turn pass it to others and so on\r\ntill the soil becomes heated to a considerable depth by conduction.\r\n\r\nA clay soil will absorb heat by conduction faster than a sandy soil\r\nbecause the particles of the clay lie so close together that the heat\r\npasses more readily from one to another than in the case of the\r\ncoarser sand.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is open and porous, warm air and warm rains can enter\r\nreadily and carry heat to the lower soil.\r\n\r\nYou have noticed how a pile of stable manure steams in cold weather.\r\nYou doubtless know that manure from the horse stable is often used to\r\nfurnish heat for hotbeds and for sweet potato beds.\r\n\r\nNow the heat which warms the manure and sends the steam out of it, and\r\nwarms the hotbed and sweet potato bed, is produced by the decaying or\r\nrotting of the manure. More or less heat is produced by the decay of\r\nall kinds of organic matter. So if the soil is well supplied with\r\norganic matter, the decay of this material will add somewhat to the\r\nwarmth of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SOILS LOSE HEAT\r\n\r\nWet one of your fingers and hold your hand up in the air. The wet\r\nfinger will feel colder than the others and will gradually become dry.\r\nThis is because some of the heat of your finger is being used to dry\r\nup the water or change it into a vapor, or in other words to evaporate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner a wet soil loses heat by the evaporation of water\r\nfrom its surface.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Heat an iron rod, take it from the fire and hold it\r\nnear your face or hand. You will feel the heat without touching the\r\nrod. The heat is radiated from the rod through the air to your body\r\nand the rod gradually cools. In the same way the soil may lose its\r\nheat by radiating it into the air. A clay soil will lose more heat by\r\nradiation than a sandy soil because the clay is more compact.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS WHICH INFLUENCE SOIL TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the dry soils are warmer than the wet ones.\r\nWhy is this? Scientists tell us that it takes a great deal more heat\r\nto warm water than it does to warm other substances. Therefore when\r\nsoil is wet it takes much more heat to warm it than if it were dry.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that of the dry soils the humus is the warmest. Why?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take two thermometers, wrap the bulb of one with a\r\npiece of black or dark colored cloth and the bulb of the other with a\r\npiece of white cloth, then place them where the sun will shine on the\r\ncloth covered bulbs. The mercury in both thermometers will be seen to\r\nrise, but in the thermometer with the dark cloth about the bulb it\r\nwill rise faster and higher than in the other. This shows that the\r\ndark cloth absorbs heat faster than the white cloth. In the same\r\nmanner a dark soil will absorb heat faster than a light colored soil;\r\ntherefore it will be warmer if dry.\r\n\r\nWhy was the dry clay warmer than the dry sand?\r\n\r\nBecause its darker color helped it to absorb heat more rapidly than\r\nthe sand, and, as the particles were smaller and more compact, heat\r\nwas carried into it more rapidly by conduction.\r\n\r\nWhy were the wet humus and clay cooler than the wet sand?\r\n\r\nAs they were darker in color and the clay was more compact than the\r\nsand, they must have absorbed more heat, but they also held more\r\nwater, and, therefore, lost more heat by evaporation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.\r\nCharts showing average temperature of a set of dry and wet soils\r\nduring a period of five days. _H_, humus; _C_, clay; _S_, sand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.\r\nTo show the value of organic matter. 1 contains clay subsoil; 2, clay\r\nsubsoil and fertilizer; 3, clay subsoil and organic matter. All\r\nplanted at the same time.]\r\n\r\nOf the dry soils, then, the humus averaged warmest, because, on\r\naccount of its dark color, it absorbed heat more readily than the\r\nothers. The dry clay was warmer than the sand on account of its color\r\nand compact texture. Of the wet soils the sand was the warmest,\r\nbecause, on account of its holding less moisture, less heat was\r\nrequired to raise its temperature and there was less cooling by\r\nevaporation, while the other soils, although they absorbed more heat\r\nthan the sand, lost more on account of greater evaporation, due to\r\ntheir holding more moisture. Why are sandy soils called warm soils and\r\nclay soils said to be cold?\r\n\r\nHow may we check losses of heat from the soil?\r\n\r\nIf we make a mulch on the surface of the soil evaporation will be\r\nchecked and therefore loss of heat by evaporation will be checked\r\nalso. The mulch will also check the conduction of heat from the lower\r\nsoil to the surface and therefore check loss of heat by radiation from\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF ORGANIC MATTER\r\n\r\nFigure 33 illustrates a simple way to show the value of organic matter\r\nin the soil. The boxes are about twelve inches square and ten inches\r\ndeep. They were filled with a clay subsoil taken from the second foot\r\nbelow the surface of the field. To the second box was added sufficient\r\ncommercial fertilizer to supply the plants with all necessary plant\r\nfood. To the third box was added some peat or decayed leaves, in\r\namount about ten per cent. of the clay subsoil. The corn was then\r\nplanted and the boxes were all given the same care. The better growth\r\nof the corn in the third box was due to the fact that the organic\r\nmatter not only furnished food for the corn but during its decay\r\nprepared mineral plant food that was locked up in the clay, and also\r\nbrought about better conditions of air and moisture by improving the\r\ntexture of the soil. The plants in the second box had sufficient plant\r\nfood, but did not make better growth because poor texture prevented\r\nproper conditions of air and moisture. \"And that's another witness\"\r\nfor organic matter. Decaying organic matter or humus is really the\r\nlife of the soil and it is greatly needed in most of the farm soils of\r\nthe eastern part of the country. It closes the pores of sandy soils\r\nand opens the clay, thus helping the sand to soak up and hold more\r\nmoisture and lessening excessive ventilation, and at the same time\r\nhelping the roots to take a firmer hold. It helps the clay to absorb\r\nrain, helps it to pump water faster, helps it to hold water longer in\r\ndry weather, increases ventilation, favors root penetration and\r\nincreases heat absorption. We can increase the amount of organic\r\nmatter in the soil by plowing in stable manure, leaves and other\r\norganic refuse of the farm, or we can plow under crops of clover,\r\ngrass, grain or other crops grown for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPLANT FOOD IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learned in previous paragraphs that the roots of plants take food\r\nfrom the soil, and that a condition necessary for the root to do its\r\nwork for the plant was the presence of available plant food in\r\nsufficient quantities.\r\n\r\nWhat is plant food? For answer let us go to the plant and ask it what\r\nit is made of.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take some newly ripened cotton or cotton wadding, a\r\ntree branch, a cornstalk, and some straw or grass. Pull the cotton\r\napart, then twist some of it and pull apart; in turn break the branch,\r\nthe cornstalk and the straw. The cotton does not pull apart readily\r\nnor do the others break easily; this is because they all contain long,\r\ntough fibres. These fibres are called woody fibre or cellulose. The\r\ncotton fibre is nearly pure cellulose.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Get together some slices of white potato, sweet potato,\r\nparsnip, broken kernels of corn, wheat and oats, a piece of laundry\r\nstarch and some tincture of iodine diluted to about the color of weak\r\ntea. Rub a few drops of the iodine on the cut surfaces of the\r\npotatoes, parsnip, and the broken surfaces of the grains. Notice that\r\nit turns them purple. Now drop a drop of the iodine on the laundry\r\nstarch. It turns that purple also. This experiment tells us that\r\nplants contain starch.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Chew a piece of sorghum cane, sugar cane, cornstalk,\r\nbeet root, turnip root, apple or cabbage. They all taste sweet and\r\nmust therefore contain sugar.\r\n\r\nExamine a number of peach and cherry trees. You will find on the trunk\r\nand branches more or less of a sticky substance called gum.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Crush on paper seeds of cotton, castor-oil bean,\r\npeanuts, Brazil nuts, hickory nuts, butternuts, etc. They make grease\r\nspots; they contain fat and oil.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Chew whole grains of wheat and find a gummy\r\nmucilaginous substance called wheat gum, or wet a pint of wheat flour\r\nto a stiff dough, let it stand about an hour, and then wash the starch\r\nout of it by kneading it under a stream of running water or in a pan\r\nof water, changing the water frequently. The result will be a tough,\r\nyellowish gray, elastic mass called gluten. This is the same as the\r\nwheat gum and is called an albuminoid because it contains nitrogen and\r\nis like albumen, a substance like the white of an egg.\r\n\r\nIf we crush or grate some potatoes or cabbage leaves to a pulp and\r\nseparate the juice, then heat the clear juice, a substance will\r\nseparate in a flaky form and settle to the bottom of the liquid. This\r\nis vegetable albumen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\r\nSoy-bean roots. Showing nodules of tubercles, the homes of\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.\r\nGarden-pea roots, showing tubercles or nodules, the homes of\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria.]\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Crush the leaves or stems of several growing plants and\r\nnotice that the crushed and exposed parts are moist. In a potato or an\r\napple we find a great deal of moisture. Plants then are partly made of\r\nwater. In fact growing plants are from 65 to 95 per cent. water.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Expose a plant or part of a plant to heat; the water is\r\ndriven off and there remains a dry portion. Heat the dry part to a\r\nhigh degree and it burns; part passes into the air as smoke and part\r\nremains behind as ashes.\r\n\r\nWe have found then the following substances in plants: Woody fibre or\r\ncellulose, starch, sugar, gum, fats and oils, albuminoids, water,\r\nashes. Aside from these are found certain coloring matters, certain\r\nacids and other matters which give taste, flavor, and poisonous\r\nqualities to fruits and vegetables. More or less of all these\r\nsubstances are found in all plants. Now these are all compound\r\nsubstances. That is, they can all be broken down into simpler\r\nsubstances, and with the exception of the water and the ashes, the\r\nplants do not take them directly from the soil.\r\n\r\nThe chemists tell us that these substances are composed of certain\r\nchemical elements, some of which the plant obtains from the air, some\r\nfrom the soil and some from water.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the substances found in plants, the elements\r\nof which they are composed, and the sources from which the plants\r\nobtain them:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n Substances found  |  Elements of which  |  Sources from  |\r\n   in plants.      |    they are made.   |  which plants  |\r\n                   |                     |  obtain them.  |\r\n-------------------+---------------------+----------------+\r\n Cellulose or      |                     |                |\r\n   woody fibre     | Carbon              | Air            |\r\n Starch            |---------------------+----------------+\r\n Sugar             |                     |                |\r\n Gum               | Oxygen              | Water          |\r\n Fat and Oil       | Hydrogen            |                |\r\n-------------------+---------------------+----------------+\r\n                   | Carbon              | Air            |\r\n                   +---------------------+----------------+\r\n Albuminoids       | Oxygen              | Water          |\r\n                   | Hydrogen            |                |\r\n                   +---------------------+----------------+\r\n                   | _Nitrogen_          |                |\r\n                   | Sulphur             |                |\r\n                   | Phosphorus          |                |\r\n-------------------+---------------------| Soil           +\r\n                   | _Phosphorus_        |                |\r\n                   | _Potassium_         |                |\r\n Ashes             | _Calcium_           |                |\r\n                   | Magnesium           |                |\r\n                   | Iron                |                |\r\n-------------------+---------------------+----------------+\r\n Water             | Oxygen              | Soil           |\r\n                   | Hydrogen            |                |\r\n-----------------------------------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nHere is a brief description of these chemical elements.\r\n\r\nOxygen, a colorless gas, forms one-fifth of the air.\r\n\r\nHydrogen, a colorless gas, forms a part of water.\r\n\r\nCarbon, a dark solid, forms nearly one-half of all organic matter;\r\ncharcoal is one of its forms. The lead in your pencil is another\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nNitrogen, a colorless gas, forms four-fifths of the air. Found in all\r\nalbuminoids.\r\n\r\nSulphur, a yellow solid.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus, a yellowish white solid.\r\n\r\nPotassium, a silver white solid.\r\n\r\nCalcium, a yellowish solid. Found in limestone.\r\n\r\nMagnesium, a silver white solid.\r\n\r\nIron, a silver gray solid.\r\n\r\nOf these elements the nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, and iron must not only exist in the soil but must\r\nalso be there in such form that the plant can use them. The plant does\r\nnot use them in their simple elementary form but in various compounds.\r\nThese compounds must be soluble in water or in weak acids.\r\n\r\nOf these seven elements of plant food the nitrogen, phosphorus, and\r\npotassium and calcium are of particular importance to the farmer,\r\nbecause they do not always exist in the soil in sufficient available\r\nquantities to produce profitable crops. Professor Roberts, of Cornell\r\nUniversity, tells us that an average acre of soil eight inches deep\r\ncontains three thousand pounds of nitrogen. The nitrogen exists\r\nlargely in the humus of the soil and it is only as the humus decays\r\nthat the nitrogen is made available. Here is another reason for\r\nkeeping the soil well supplied with organic matter. The decay of this\r\norganic matter is hastened by working the soil; therefore good tillage\r\nhelps to supply the plant with nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIf the nitrogen becomes available when there is no crop on the soil it\r\nwill be washed out by rains and so lost. Therefore the soil,\r\nespecially if it is sandy, should be covered with a crop the year\r\nthrough. Many lands lose large amounts of plant food by being left\r\nbare through the fall and winter, especially in those parts of the\r\ncountry where the land does not freeze. The phosphorus, potassium and\r\ncalcium also exist in most soils in considerable quantities, but often\r\nare not available; thorough tillage and the addition of organic matter\r\nwill help to make them available, and new supplies may be added in the\r\nform of fertilizers. Calcium is found in nearly all soils in\r\nsufficient quantities for most crops, but sometimes there is not\r\nenough of it for such crops as clover, cowpea, alfalfa, etc. It is\r\nalso used to improve soil texture. The entire subject of commercial\r\nfertilizers is based almost entirely on the fact of the lack of these\r\nfour elements in the soil in sufficient available quantities to grow\r\nprofitable crops. The plant gets its phosphorus from phosphoric acid,\r\nits potassium from potash, and its calcium from lime.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of plants which have the power of taking free\r\nnitrogen from the air. These are the leguminous plants; such as\r\nclover, beans, cowpeas, alfalfa, soy bean, etc. They do it through the\r\nacid of microscopic organisms called bacteria which live in nodules or\r\ntubercles on the roots of these plants (Figs. 34-35). Collect roots of\r\nthese plants and find the nodules on them. The bacteria take nitrogen\r\nfrom the air which penetrates the soil and give it over to the plants.\r\nHere is another reason for good soil ventilation.\r\n\r\nThis last fact brings us to another very important property of soils.\r\nSoils have existing in them many very small plants called bacteria.\r\nThey are so very small that it would take several hundred of them to\r\nreach across the edge of this sheet of paper. We cannot see them with\r\nthe naked eye but only with the most powerful microscopes. Some of\r\nthese minute plants are great friends to the farmer, for it is largely\r\nthrough their work that food is made available for the higher plants.\r\nSome of them break down the organic matter and help prepare the\r\nnitrogen for the larger plants. Others help the leguminous plants to\r\nfeed on the nitrogen of the air. To do their work they need warmth,\r\nmoisture, air, and some mineral food; these conditions we bring about\r\nby improving the texture of the soil by means of thorough tillage and\r\nthe use of organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SEEDS TO SPROUT\r\n\r\nIn the spring comes the great seed-planting time on the farm, in the\r\nhome garden and in the school garden. Many times the questions will be\r\nasked: Why didn't those seeds come up? How shall I plant seeds so as\r\nto help them sprout easily and grow into strong plants? To answer\r\nthese questions, perform a few experiments with seeds, and thus find\r\nout what conditions are necessary for seeds to sprout, or germinate.\r\nFor these experiments you will need a few teacups, glass tumblers or\r\ntin cans, such as tomato cans or baking-powder cans; a few plates,\r\neither of tin or crockery; some wide-mouth bottles that will hold\r\nabout half a pint, such as pickle, olive, or yeast bottles or\r\ndruggists' wide-mouth prescription bottles; and a few pieces of cloth.\r\nAlso seeds of corn, garden peas and beans.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Put seeds of corn, garden peas, and beans (about a\r\nhandful of each) to soak in bottles or tumblers of water. Next day,\r\ntwo hours earlier in the day, put a duplicate lot of seeds to soak.\r\nWhen this second lot of seeds has soaked two hours, you will have two\r\nlots of soaked seeds of each kind, one of which has soaked twenty-four\r\nhours and the other two hours. Now take these seeds from the water and\r\ndry the surplus water from them by gently patting or rubbing a few at\r\na time in the folds of a piece of cloth, taking care not to break the\r\nskin or outer coating of the seed. Place them in dry bottles, putting\r\nin enough to cover the bottoms of the bottles about three seeds deep;\r\ncork the bottles. If you cannot find corks, tie paper over the mouths\r\nof the bottles. Label the bottles \"Seeds soaked 24 hours,\" \"Seeds\r\nsoaked 2 hours,\" and let them stand in a warm place several days. If\r\nthere is danger of freezing at night, the bottles of seeds may be kept\r\nin the kitchen or living room where it is warm, until they sprout.\r\n\r\nObserve the seeds from day to day. The seeds that soaked twenty-four\r\nhours will sprout readily (Fig. 36), while most, if not all, of those\r\nthat soaked only two hours will not sprout. Why is this? It is because\r\nthe two-hour soaked seeds do not receive sufficient moisture to carry\r\non the process of sprouting.\r\n\r\nOur experiment teaches us that seeds will not sprout until they\r\nreceive enough moisture to soak them through and through.\r\n\r\nThis also teaches that when we plant seeds we must so prepare the soil\r\nfor them and so plant them that they will be able to get sufficient\r\nmoisture to sprout.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Soak some beans, peas or corn, twenty-four hours;\r\ncarefully dry them with a cloth. In one half-pint bottle place enough\r\nof them to cover the bottom of the bottle two or three seeds deep;\r\nmark this bottle A. Fill another bottle two-thirds full of them and\r\nmark the bottle B (Fig. 37). Cork the bottles and let them stand for\r\nseveral days. Also let some seeds remain soaking in the water. The few\r\nseeds in bottle A will sprout, while, the larger number in bottle B\r\nwill not sprout, or will produce only very short sprouts. Why do not\r\nthe seeds sprout easily in the bottle which is more than half full?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question try the following experiment:\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Carefully loosen the cork in bottle B (the bottle\r\ncontaining poorly sprouted seeds), light a match, remove the cork from\r\nthe bottle and introduce the lighted match. The match will stop\r\nburning as soon as it is held in the bottle, because there is no fresh\r\nair in the bottle to keep the match burning. Test bottle A in the same\r\nway. What has become of the fresh air that was in the bottles when the\r\nseeds were put in them? The seeds have taken something from it and\r\nhave left bad air in its place; they need fresh air to help them\r\nsprout, but they have not sprouted so well in bottle B because there\r\nwas not fresh air enough for so many seeds. The seeds in the water do\r\nnot sprout because there is not enough air in the water. Now try\r\nanother experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.\r\nTo show that seeds need water for germination. The beans in bottle _A_\r\nwere soaked 2 hours, those in bottle _B_ were soaked 24 hours. They\r\nwere then removed from the water and put into dry bottles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\r\nTo show that seeds need air for germination. The beans in both bottles\r\nwere soaked 24 hours, and then were put into dry bottles Bottle _A_\r\ncontained sufficient air to start the few seeds. Bottle _B_ had not\r\nenough. The water in the tumbler _C_ did not contain sufficient air\r\nfor germination. See experiment, page 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.\r\nTo show that seeds need air for germination. Corn planted in puddled\r\nclay in tumbler _A_ could not get sufficent air for sprouting. The\r\nmoist sand in tumbler _B_ admitted sufficient air for germination.]\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Fill some tumblers or teacups or tin cans with wet sand\r\nand others with clay that has been wet and then thoroughly stirred\r\ntill it is about the consistency of cake batter or fresh mixed mortar.\r\nTake a tumbler of the wet sand and one of the wet clay and plant two\r\nor three kernels of corn in each, pressing the kernels down one-half\r\nor three-quarters of an inch below the surface; cover the seeds and\r\ncarefully smooth the surface. In other tumblers plant peas, beans, and\r\nother seeds. Cover the tumblers with saucers, or pieces of glass or\r\nboard to keep the soil from drying. Watch them for several days. If\r\nthe clay tends to dry and crack, moisten it, fill the cracks and\r\nsmooth the surface. The seeds in the sand will sprout but those in the\r\nclay will not (see Fig. 38). Why is this? Water fills the small spaces\r\nbetween the particles of clay and shuts out the fresh air which is\r\nnecessary for the sprouting of the seeds.\r\n\r\nThis teaches us that when we plant seeds we must so prepare the soil,\r\nand so plant the seeds that they will get enough fresh air to enable\r\nthem to sprout, or, in other words, the soil must be well ventilated.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Plant seeds of corn and beans in each of two tumblers;\r\nset one out of doors in a cold place and keep the other in a warm\r\nplace in the house. The seeds kept in the house will sprout quickly\r\nbut those outside in the cold will not sprout at all. This shows us\r\nthat seeds will not sprout without heat.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is warm place one of the tumblers in a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nWhy don't we plant corn in December?\r\n\r\nWhy not plant melons in January?\r\n\r\nWhy not plant cotton in November?\r\n\r\nThe seeds of farm crops may be divided into two classes according to\r\nthe temperatures at which they will germinate or sprout readily and\r\ncan be safely planted.\r\n\r\nClass A. Those seeds that will germinate or sprout at an average\r\ntemperature of forty-five degrees in the shade, or at about the time\r\nthe peach and plum trees blossom:\r\n\r\n     Barley           Beet            Parsley\r\n     Oats             Carrot          Parsnip\r\n     Rye              Cabbage         Onion\r\n     Wheat            Cauliflower     Pea\r\n     Red Clover       Endive          Radish\r\n     Crimson Clover   Kale            Turnip\r\n     Grasses          Lettuce         Spinach\r\n\r\nThese can be planted with safety in the spring as soon as the ground\r\ncan be prepared, and some of them, if planted in the fall, live\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\nClass B. Those seeds that will germinate or sprout at an average\r\ntemperature of sixty degrees in the shade, or when the apple trees\r\nblossom:\r\n\r\n     Alfalfa          Soy Bean        Squash\r\n     Cow Pea          Pole Bean       Cucumber\r\n     Corn             String Bean     Pumpkin\r\n     Cotton           Melon           Tomato\r\n     Egg Plant        Okra            Pepper\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to answer the question: What conditions are necessary\r\nfor seeds to sprout or germinate? These conditions are:\r\n\r\nThe presence of enough moisture to keep the seed thoroughly soaked.\r\n\r\nThe presence of fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe presence of more or less heat.\r\n\r\nThis teaches us that when we plant seeds in the window box or in the\r\ngarden or on the farm we must so prepare the soil and so plant the\r\nseeds that they will be able to obtain sufficient moisture, heat, and\r\nair for sprouting. The moisture must be film water, for if it is free\r\nwater or capillary water filling the soil pores, there can be no\r\nventilation and, therefore, no sprouting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED TESTING\r\n\r\nIn a previous experiment (page 73) the seeds planted in the wet clay\r\ndid not sprout (see Fig. 38). In answer to the question, \"Why is\r\nthis?\" some will say the seeds were bad. It often happens on the farm\r\nthat the seeds do not sprout well and the farmer accuses the seedsman\r\nof selling him poor seed, but does not think that he himself may be\r\nthe cause of the failure by not putting the seeds under the proper\r\nconditions for sprouting. How can we tell whether or not our seeds\r\nwill sprout if properly planted? We can test them by putting a number\r\nof seeds from each package under proper conditions of moisture, heat\r\nand air, as follows:\r\n\r\nFor large seeds take two plates (see Fig. 39) and a piece of cloth as\r\nwide as the bottom of the plate and twice as long. Count out fifty or\r\none hundred seeds from a package, wet the cloth and wring it out.\r\nPlace one end of the cloth on the plate, place the seeds on the cloth\r\nand fold the other end of the cloth over them. On a slip of paper mark\r\nthe number of seeds and date, and place on the edge of the plate. Now\r\ncover the whole with another plate, or with a pane of glass to keep\r\nfrom drying. Set the plate of seeds in a warm room and examine\r\noccasionally for several days. If the cloth tends to dry, moisten it\r\nfrom time to time. As the seeds sprout take them out and keep a record\r\nof them. Or leave them in the plate and after four or five days count\r\nthose that have sprouted. This will give the proportion of good seeds\r\nin the packages.\r\n\r\nFor small seeds fold the cloth first and place the seeds on top of it.\r\n\r\nAnother good tester for small seeds is made by running about an inch\r\nof freshly mixed plaster of Paris into a small dish or pan and\r\nmoulding flat cavities in the surface by setting bottles into it. The\r\ndish or pan and bottles should be slightly greased to prevent the\r\nplaster sticking to them. When the cast has hardened it should be\r\nturned out of the mould and set in a large dish or pan. One hundred\r\nsmall seeds are then counted out and put into one of the cavities,\r\nothers are put into the other cavities. Water is then poured into the\r\npan till it rises half way up the side of the plaster cast or porous\r\nsaucer. The whole thing is then covered to keep in the moisture (Fig.\r\n40).\r\n\r\nAnother method is to get boxes of finely pulverized sand or soil and\r\ncarefully plant in it fifty or one hundred seeds of each kind to be\r\ntested. Then by counting those that come up, the proportion of good\r\nseeds can easily be found.\r\n\r\nIn every case the testers should be kept at a temperature of about\r\nseventy degrees or about that of the living room.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SEEDS COME UP\r\n\r\nPlant a few seeds of corn, beans and garden peas in boxes or tumblers\r\neach day for several days in succession. Then put seeds of corn, beans\r\nand garden peas to soak. After these have soaked a few hours, examine\r\nthem to find out how the seed is constructed. Note first the general\r\nshape of the seeds and the scar (Fig. 41-4) on one side as in the bean\r\nor pea and at one end or on one edge in the corn. This scar, also\r\ncalled hilum, is where the seed was attached to the seed vessel.\r\n\r\nCut into the bean and pea, they will be found to be protected by a\r\ntough skin or coat. Within this the contents of the seed are divided\r\ninto two bodies of equal size lying close to each other and called\r\nseed leaves or cotyledons (Fig. 41-5). Between them near one end or\r\none side will be found a pair of very small white leaves and a little\r\nround pointed projection. The part bearing the tiny leaves was\r\nformerly, and is sometimes now, called the plumule, but is generally\r\ncalled the epicotyl, because it grows above or upon the cotyledons.\r\nThe round pointed projection was formerly called the radicle, but is\r\nnow spoken of as the hypocotyl, because it grows below or under the\r\ncotyledons.\r\n\r\nExamine a dry kernel of corn and notice that on one side there is a\r\nslight oval-shaped depression (Fig. 41-1). Now take a soaked kernel\r\nand cut it in two pieces making the cut lengthwise from the top of the\r\nkernel through the centre of the oval depression and examine the cut\r\nsurface. A more or less triangular-shaped body will be found on the\r\nconcave side of the kernel (see Figs. 41-2 and 41-3). This is the one\r\ncotyledon of the corn. Besides this will be found quite a mass of\r\nstarchy material packed in the coverings of the kernel and in close\r\ncontact with one side of the cotyledon. This is sometimes called the\r\nendosperm.\r\n\r\nWithin the cotyledon will be found a little growing shoot pointed\r\ntoward the top of the kernel. This is the epicotyl, and another\r\ngrowing tip pointed toward the lower end of the kernel; this is the\r\nhypocotyl or the part which penetrates the soil and forms roots.\r\n\r\nNow examine the seeds that were planted in succession. Some will be\r\njust starting a growing point down into the soil. Some of them have\r\nprobably come up and others are at intermediate stages.\r\n\r\nHow did the bean get up?\r\n\r\nAfter sending down a root the hypocotyl began to develop into a strong\r\nstem which crooked itself until it reached the surface of the soil and\r\nthen pulled the cotyledons or seed-leaves after it (Fig. 42). These\r\nturn green and after a time shrink and fall off.\r\n\r\nThe pea cotyledons were left down in the soil, the epicotyl alone\r\npushing up to the surface. The corn pushed a slender growing point to\r\nthe surface leaving the cotyledon and endosperm behind in the soil but\r\nstill attached to the little plant (Fig. 43).\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF COTYLEDONS AND ENDOSPERM\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Plant some beans in a pot or box of soil and as soon as\r\nthey come up cut the seed-leaves from some of them and watch their\r\ngrowth for several days. It will soon be seen that the plants on which\r\nthe seed-leaves were left increase in size much more rapidly than\r\nthose from which the seed-leaves were removed (see Figs. 43 and 44).\r\nSprout some corn in the seed tester. When the seedlings are two or\r\nthree inches long, get a wide-mouthed bottle or a tumbler of water and\r\na piece of pasteboard large enough to cover the top. Cut a slit about\r\nan eighth of an inch wide from the margin to the centre of the\r\npasteboard disk. Take one of the seedlings, insert it in the slit,\r\nwith the kernel under the pasteboard so that it just touches the\r\nwater. Take another seedling of the same size, carefully remove the\r\nkernel from it without injuring the root, and place this seedling in\r\nthe slit beside the first one (Fig. 45). Watch the growth of these two\r\nseedlings for a few days. Repeat this with sprouted peas. In each case\r\nit will be found that the removal of the seed-leaves or the kernel\r\nchecks the growth of the seedling. Therefore, it must be that the\r\nseed-leaves which appear above ground, as in the case of the bean, or\r\nthe kernel of the corn which remains below the surface of the soil,\r\nfurnish the little plant with food until its roots have grown strong\r\nenough to take sufficient food from the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.\r\nA seed-tester, consisting of two plates and a moist cloth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--A SEED-TESTER.\r\nA plaster cast with cavities in the surface for small seeds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.\r\n1.

Put one kernel at the bottom and against the side of\r\nthe glass, place the next one a half inch or an inch higher and an\r\ninch and a half to one side of the first seed and against the glass.\r\nContinue this till the top of the glass is reached (Fig. 2). Leave the\r\nlast seed not more than one-fourth inch below the top of the soil. The\r\nsoil should be moist at the start and the seeds should all be against\r\nthe glass so they can be seen. This can best be done by planting as\r\nyou fill the glass with soil. Plant peas and beans in the same way. Do\r\nnot water the soil after planting. Set aside in a warm place and wait\r\nfor the seeds to come up.\r\n\r\nAnother method of performing this experiment is to make a box having\r\none side glass (Fig. 46). The length and the depth of the box will\r\ndepend upon the size of the glass you use. Fill the box nearly full of\r\nmoist soil and plant seeds of corn and beans and peas at depths of\r\none-quarter inch, one inch, two inches, three inches, and four\r\ninches. These seeds can best be put in as the box is being filled.\r\nHold each individual seed against the glass with a stick so that when\r\nplanted they may be seen through the glass. Protect the seeds and\r\nroots from light by using a sheet of cardboard, tin or wrapping paper\r\nor a piece of board, and set in a warm place.\r\n\r\nMany of the seeds planted only one-quarter inch deep will not sprout\r\nbecause the soil about them will probably dry out before they take\r\nfrom it enough moisture to sprout. The one and two-inch deep seeds\r\nwill probably come up all right. Of the three and four-inch deep\r\nseeds, the corn and peas will probably make their way to the surface\r\nbecause they send up only a slender shoot, which can easily force its\r\nway through the soil. The deep-planted beans will make a strong effort\r\nbut will not succeed in forcing their way to the surface because they\r\nare not able to lift the large seed-leaves through so much soil, and\r\nwill finally give up the struggle. If any of the deeper beans do get\r\nup, the seed-leaves will probably be broken off and the little plant\r\nwill starve and be dwarfed. This experiment teaches us that we should\r\nplant seeds deep enough to get sufficient moisture for sprouting and\r\nyet not so deep that the young seedlings will not be able to force\r\ntheir way to the surface.\r\n\r\nSeeds which raise their cotyledons above the soil should not be\r\nplanted as deep as those which do not. Large, strong seeds like corn,\r\npeas, etc., which do not lift their cotyledons above the surface,\r\ncan be planted with safety at a depth of from one to four or five\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.\r\nTo show how the bean plant gets up. Notice the curved hypocotyls\r\npulling the seed-leaves or cotyledon out of the soil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.\r\nTo show how the corn-plant gets out of the soil. A slender growing\r\npoint pushes straight up through the soil, leaving the kernel behind.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.\r\nTo show the use of the cotyledons. These are the plants shown in\r\ntumbler 2, Fig 42, forty-eight hours after removing the cotyledons\r\nfrom plant _B._ Plant _B_, although first up, has been handicapped by\r\nthe loss of its cotyledons.]\r\n\r\nSeeds of carrot, celery, parsley, parsnip and egg plant are weak and\r\nrather slow in germinating. It is customary to plant them rather\r\nthickly in order that by the united strength of many seeds they may\r\nmore readily come to the surface. This point should be observed also\r\nin planting seeds in heavy ground that is liable to pack and crust\r\nover before the seeds germinate.\r\n\r\nSeed should always be sown in freshly stirred soil and may be planted\r\nby hand or with a machine.\r\n\r\nFor the home garden and the school garden, and when only small\r\nquantities of any one variety are planted, a machine is hardly\r\ndesirable and hand planting is preferable.\r\n\r\nThe rows are marked out with the garden marker, or the end of a hoe or\r\nrake handle (Fig. 47), using a line or the edge of a board as a guide.\r\nThe seeds are then carefully and evenly dropped in the mark or furrow.\r\n\r\nThe covering is done with the hand or a rake or hoe, and the soil is\r\npressed over the seeds by patting it with the covering tool or walking\r\non the row and pressing it with the feet. This pressing of the soil\r\nover the seeds is to bring the particles of soil close to each other\r\nand to the seed so that film water can climb upon them and moisten the\r\nseed sufficiently for sprouting.\r\n\r\nA convenient way of distributing small seeds like those of turnip and\r\ncabbage, is to take a small pasteboard box or tin spice or\r\nbaking-powder box, and punch a small hole in the bottom near one end\r\nor side. Through this the seeds can be sifted quite evenly.\r\n\r\nFor the larger operations of the farm and market garden, hand and\r\nhorse-power drills and broadcasters are generally used, though some\r\nfarmers still plant large fields by hand.\r\n\r\nThe grasses and clovers are generally broadcasted by hand or machine,\r\nand are then lightly harrowed and are generally rolled.\r\n\r\nThe small grains (wheat, oats, etc.) are broadcasted by many farmers,\r\nbut drilling is considered better. With the grain drill the seed is\r\ndeposited at a uniform depth and at regular intervals. In\r\nbroadcasting, some of the seeds are planted too deep, and some too\r\nshallow, and others are left on the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nFrom experiment it has been found that there is a loss of about\r\none-fifth of the seed when broadcasted as compared with drilling.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of grass seed, the grains are generally rolled after\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\nCorn is planted by hand, or by hand- and horse-corn-planters, which\r\ndrop a certain number of seeds at any required distance in the row.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of seed drills made for planting vegetable seeds\r\nwhich are good machines.\r\n\r\nThe main points to be considered in seed drills or seed planting\r\nmachines are:\r\n\r\nSimplicity and durability of structure.\r\n\r\nEase of draft.\r\n\r\nUniformity in quantity of seed planted, and in the distances apart and\r\ndepth to which they are planted.\r\n\r\nThe distances apart at which seeds are planted vary according to the\r\ncharacter of the plant. Bushy, spreading plants and tall plants\r\nrequire more room than low and slender-growing plants.\r\n\r\nVisit the neighboring hardware stores and farms and examine as many\r\nseed-growing tools as possible to see how they are constructed and how\r\nproperly used. Practice planting with these tools, if possible.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of grain drills and other seed-planting machines will be\r\nfound in seed catalogues, hardware catalogues, and in the advertising\r\ncolumns of agricultural papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nIn order to become familiar with the farm and garden seeds, obtain\r\nsamples of as many of them as possible. Put them in small\r\nbottles--homoeopathic vials for instance--or stick a few of each\r\nkind on squares of cardboard. Arrange them in groups according to\r\nresemblances or relationships, comparing not only the seeds but the\r\nplants on which they grew. If you cannot recall the plants, and there\r\nis no collection available, study the illustrations in seed catalogues\r\nwhich can be obtained from seedsmen. The following groups contain\r\nmost of the farm and garden seeds, excepting flower seeds:\r\n\r\n  GRASS FAMILY:          MUSTARD FAMILY:       NIGHTSHADE FAMILY:\r\n  Corn,                  Mustard,              Potato,\r\n  Wheat,                 Cabbage,              Tomato,\r\n  Oats,                  Cauliflower,          Egg Plant,\r\n  Rye,                   Collards,             Pepper.\r\n  Barley,                Brussels Sprouts,\r\n  Sorghum,               Kale,                 GOOSEFOOT FAMILY:\r\n  Orchard Grass,         Kohl Rabi,            Beet,\r\n  Red Top Grass,         Radish,               Chard,\r\n  Timothy,               Ruta Baga,            Spinach,\r\n  Kentucky Blue Grass.

Seeds 1 and 5 did not\r\nsprout because they were not deep enough to get sufficient moisture.\r\nThe corn-plants from sprouting seeds 2, 3 and 4 all pushed their\r\nslender growing points to the surface. Of the beans, No. 6 succeeded\r\nin pulling the cotyledons to the surface, and has made a good plant.\r\nNos. 7 and 8, although they made a hard struggle, were not able to\r\nraise the cotyledons through so great a depth of soil, and finally\r\ngave up the struggle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING\r\n\r\nThe seeds of some crops--cabbage, tomato, lettuce, for example--are\r\nplanted in window boxes, hot-beds, cold frames or a corner of the\r\nfield or garden. When the seedlings have developed three or four\r\nleaves or have become large enough to crowd one another, they are\r\nthinned out or are transplanted into other boxes, frames or plots of\r\nground, or are transplanted into the field or garden.\r\n\r\nThe time and method of transplanting depend largely on\r\n\r\nThe condition of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFor best results in field planting the plant should be well grown,\r\nstrong and stocky, with well developed roots and three or four strong\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be thoroughly prepared, moist and freshly stirred. A\r\nmoist day just before a light shower is the best time. These\r\nconditions being present, the plants are carefully lifted from the\r\nseed bed with as little disturbance of the roots as possible and\r\ncarried to the field or garden. Some plants, like cabbage, will stand\r\nconsiderable rough treatment, while others, like the eggplant, require\r\ngreater care.\r\n\r\nIn the field or garden a hole is made for each plant with the hand, a\r\nstick or dibber or any convenient tool, the roots of the plant are\r\ncarefully placed in it and the soil is pressed about them. If the\r\nsoil is moist and freshly stirred, new roots will generally start in a\r\nvery short time.\r\n\r\nPlants that have been grown in pots, small boxes or tin cans, as\r\ntomatoes and eggplants are sometimes grown, may be quickly\r\ntransplanted in the field in the following manner: Open the furrow\r\nwith a small plow, knock the plants out of the pots or cans and place\r\nthem along the land side of the furrow at the proper distances, then\r\nturn the soil back against them with the plow.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a large number of plants to be set, as in planting\r\ncabbage, sweet potatoes, etc., by the acre, it is not always\r\nconvenient to wait for a cloudy day or to defer operations till the\r\nsun is low in the afternoon. In such cases the roots of the plants\r\nshould be dipped in water or in thin mud just before setting them, or\r\na little water may be poured into each hole as the plant is put in.\r\nThe soil should always be well firmed about the roots. The firming of\r\nthe soil about the roots of a newly set plant is as important as\r\nfirming it over planted seeds. The soil should be packed so tightly\r\nthat the individual leaves will be torn off when an attempt is made to\r\npull the plant up by them.\r\n\r\nIn dry or warm weather it is a good plan to trim the tops of plants\r\nwhen setting them. This can be done readily with some plants, such as\r\ncabbage and lettuce, by taking a bundle of them in one hand and with\r\nthe other twisting off about half of their tops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.\r\nOperations of seed-planting: 1, making the drill; 2, dropping the\r\nseeds; 3, covering the seeds; 4, packing the soil over the seeds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.\r\nA collection of planting machines. The large central machine is a\r\ngrass and grain planter. The one on the left, a potato planter. The\r\none on the right, a corn, bean, and pea planter. The three smaller\r\nmachines in front are hand seed planters.]\r\n\r\nThe proper time to transplant fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs\r\nis during the fall, winter and early spring, which is their dormant or\r\nresting season, as this gives the injured roots a chance to recover\r\nand start new rootlets before the foliage of the plant makes demands\r\non them for food and moisture.\r\n\r\nIn taking up large plants many roots are broken or crushed. These\r\nbroken and injured roots should be trimmed off with a smooth cut. The\r\ntree or shrub is then placed in the hole prepared for it and the soil\r\ncarefully filled in and packed about the roots. After the plant is\r\nset, the top should be trimmed back to correspond with the loss of\r\nroot. If the plant is not trimmed, more shoots and leaves will start\r\ninto growth than the damaged roots can properly furnish with food and\r\nwater, and the plant will make a weak growth or die.\r\n\r\nThere are on the market a number of hand transplanting machines which,\r\nfrom their lack of perfection, have not come into general use. Many of\r\nthem require more time to operate than is consumed in hand planting. A\r\nnumber of large machines for transplanting are in successful and\r\nsatisfactory use on large truck and tobacco farms. These machines are\r\ndrawn by horses and carry water for watering each plant as it is set.\r\n\r\nPractice transplanting in window boxes or in the open soil and see how\r\nmany of your plants will survive the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSPADING AND PLOWING\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have learned the important conditions necessary for the sprouting\r\nof seeds and for the growth and development of roots. We have also\r\nlearned something about the soil, its properties, and its relation to,\r\nor its behavior toward these important conditions. We are therefore\r\nprepared to discuss intelligently methods of treating the soil to\r\nbring about, or maintain, these conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPADING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nThe typical tool for preparing the soil for root growth is a spade or\r\nspading fork (Fig. 49). With this tool properly used we can prepare\r\nthe soil for a crop better than with any other.\r\n\r\nIn spading, the spade or fork should be pushed into the soil with the\r\nfoot the full length of the blade and nearly straight down. The handle\r\nis then pulled back and the spadeful of earth is pried loose, lifted\r\nslightly, thrown a little forward, and at the same time turned. The\r\nlumps are then broken by striking them with the blade or teeth of the\r\ntool. All weeds and trash should be covered during the operation. A\r\ncommon fault of beginners is to put the spade in the soil on a slant\r\nand only about half the length of the blade, and then flop the soil\r\nover in the hole from which it came, often covering the edge of the\r\nunspaded soil. The good spader works from side to side across his\r\npiece of ground, keeping a narrow trench or furrow between the spaded\r\nand unspaded soil, into which weeds and trash and manure may be drawn\r\nand thoroughly covered, and also to prevent covering the unspaded\r\nsoil. If this work has been well done with the ordinary spade or fork\r\nand finished with a rake, the result will be a bed of soil twelve to\r\nfifteen inches deep, fine and mellow and well prepared for root\r\npenetration, for good ventilation, for the absorbing and holding of\r\nmoisture and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis method should always be employed for small gardens and flower\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING\r\n\r\nFor preparing large areas of soil the plow is the tool most generally\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY DO WE SPADE AND PLOW?\r\n\r\nTo break and pulverize the soil and make it soft and mellow, so the\r\nroots of plants may enter it in search of food, and get a firm hold\r\nfor the support of the plant which is above ground.\r\n\r\nTo make the soil open and porous, so that it can more readily absorb\r\nrain as it falls on the surface.\r\n\r\nTo check loss of water by evaporation.\r\n\r\nTo admit air to the roots of plants. Also to allow air to act\r\nchemically on the mineral and organic matter of the soil and make them\r\navailable to the crop.\r\n\r\nTo raise the temperature of soils in the spring, or of damp soils at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\nTo mix manures and organic matter with the soil. The more thoroughly\r\nmanure is distributed through the soil the more easily plants will get\r\nit and the greater will be its effect on the soil.\r\n\r\nTo destroy the insect enemies of the plant by turning them up to the\r\nfrost and the birds.\r\n\r\nTo kill weeds. Weeds injure crops:\r\n\r\nThey waste valuable moisture by pumping it up from the soil and\r\nsending it out into the air through their leaves. In this way they do\r\ntheir greatest injury to crops.\r\n\r\nThey crowd and shade the crop.\r\n\r\nThey take plant food which the plant should have.\r\n\r\nSpading and plowing bring about conditions necessary for the sprouting\r\nor germination of seeds.\r\n\r\nSpading and plowing also tend to bring about conditions necessary for\r\nthe very important work of certain of the soil bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTS OF A PLOW\r\n\r\nIt will be found that a good farm plow has the following parts (Fig.\r\n50):\r\n\r\n_A standard_ or stock, the central part of the plow to which many of\r\nthe other parts are attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--SPADING-FORK AND SPADE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--A WOOD BEAM-PLOW\r\n_a_, stock; _b_, beam; _c_, handles; _d_, clevis, _e_, shackle, _f_,\r\nshare; _g_, mould board; _h_, landside; _k_, jointer or skimmer, _l_,\r\ntruck or wheel, _p_, point or nose, _s_, shin.]\r\n\r\n_A beam_, to which the power is attached by which the plow is drawn.\r\nSome plows have wooden beams and others have iron beams.\r\n\r\n_Handles_ by which the plowman guides and steadies the plow and also\r\nturns it at the corners of the plowed ground in going about the field.\r\n\r\n_A clevis_, which is attached to the end of the beam and is used to\r\nregulate the depth of plowing. To the clevis is attached a _draft\r\nring_ or _shackle_, to which the horse or team is fastened. To make\r\nthe plow run deep the draft ring or shackle is placed in the upper\r\nholes or notches of the clevis; to make it run shallow the ring is\r\nplaced in the lower holes. On some plows there are only notches in the\r\nclevis for holding the ring, they answer the same purpose as holes.\r\nThe clevis is also used on some plows to regulate the width of the\r\nfurrow. By moving the draft ring or shackle towards the plowed land\r\nthe plow is made to cut a wider furrow, moving it away from the plowed\r\nland causes the plow to cut narrower.\r\n\r\nSome plows have a double clevis so that the draft ring may be raised\r\nor lowered, or moved to right or left. With some plows the width of\r\nthe furrow is adjusted by moving the beam at its attachment to the\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\n_A share_, called by some the point, which shears the bottom of the\r\nfurrow slice from the land. The share should be sharp, especially for\r\nplowing in grass land and land full of tough roots. If the share,\r\nparticularly the point, becomes worn so that it bevels from beneath\r\nupwards it will be hard to keep the plow in the soil, for it will tend\r\nto slide up to the surface. If this happens the share must be renewed\r\nor sharpened. Plows are being made now with share and point separate,\r\nand both of these reversible (Fig. 51), so that if either becomes worn\r\non the under side it can be taken out and turned over and put back and\r\nit is all right, they thus become self-sharpening.\r\n\r\n_A mouldboard._ This turns and breaks the furrow slice. The degree to\r\nwhich the mouldboard pulverizes depends on the steepness of its slant\r\nupward and the abruptness of its curve sidewise. The steeper it is and\r\nthe more abrupt the curve, the greater is its pulverizing power. A\r\nsteep, abrupt mouldboard is adapted to light soils and to the heavier\r\nsoils when they are comparatively dry. This kind of a plow is apt to\r\npuddle a clay soil if it is quite moist. For breaking new land a plow\r\nwith a long, gradually sloping share and mouldboard is used.\r\n\r\n_A landslide_, which keeps the plow in place.\r\n\r\n_A coulter._ Some plows have a straight knife-like coulter (Fig. 52)\r\nwhich is fastened to the beam just in front of the mouldboard and\r\nserves to cut the furrow slice from the land. In some plows this is\r\nreplaced by an upward projection of the share; this is wide at the\r\nback and sharp in front and is called the shin of the plow from its\r\nresemblance to the shin bone. The coulter is sometimes made in the\r\nform of a sharp, revolving disk (Fig. 53), called a rolling coulter.\r\nThis form is very useful in sod ground and in turning under vines and\r\ntall weeds. It also lessens the draft of the plow.\r\n\r\n_A jointer_ or skimmer which skims stubble and grass from the surface\r\nof the soil and throws them into the bottom of the furrow where they\r\nare completely covered. The jointer helps also to pulverize the soil.\r\n\r\n_A truck_ or wheel, attached under the end of the beam. This truck\r\nmakes the plow run steadier. This is sometimes used to make the plow\r\nrun shallower by setting it low down. This is not right, for it then\r\nacts as a brake and makes the plow draw harder. The depth of the\r\nfurrow should be adjusted at the clevis.\r\n\r\nA plow not only has parts but it has character also.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD PLOW\r\n\r\nA good plow should be strong in build and light in weight.\r\n\r\nThe draft should be as light as possible.\r\n\r\nThe plow should run steadily.\r\n\r\nA good plow should not only turn the soil but should pulverize it as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nWhen plowing, the team should be hitched to the plow with as short\r\ntraces as possible, and the plow should be so adjusted that it will\r\ncut furrows of the required width and thickness with the least\r\npossible draft on the team and the least exertion on the part of the\r\nplowman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FURROW SLICE\r\n\r\nIn plowing, the furrow slice may be cut thin and wide and be turned\r\nover flat. This method is adapted to breaking new land and heavy sod\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt may be cut thick and narrow and be turned up on edge.\r\n\r\nOr it may be cut of such a width and depth that the plow will turn it\r\nat an angle of about forty-five degrees. By this last method the\r\ngreatest amount of soil can be turned at least expense of labor; the\r\nfurrow slice can be more thoroughly broken; the greatest surface is\r\nexposed to the action of the air, and plant food is more evenly\r\ndistributed through the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DEEP SHALL WE PLOW?\r\n\r\nWe learned in a previous chapter that the roots of farm plants develop\r\nlargely in that part of the soil which is worked by the plow;\r\ntherefore, to have as much tilled soil as possible for root growth, we\r\nshould generally plow as deep as possible without turning too much of\r\nthe subsoil to the surface. Lands that have been plowed deep should be\r\ndeepened gradually by plowing up a half-inch to an inch of subsoil\r\neach year until the plow reaches a depth of at least nine or ten\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThere is an opinion among many farmers that sandy soils should not be\r\nplowed deep. But as these soils are apt to be leachy it seems best to\r\nfill them with organic matter to as great a depth as possible to\r\nincrease their water-holding power, and this can best be done by\r\nplowing farm manures in deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--A SLIP-NOSE SHARE. _N_, A SLIP-NOSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--_C_, STRAIGHT KNIFE COULTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.\r\nAn iron beam-plow, with rolling coulter and double clevis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--A ROLLING COULTER HARROW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--SPRING-TOOTHED HARROWS.]\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the South the farmers use very small plows and small\r\nanimals to draw them. The result is that the soil is not prepared to a\r\nsufficient depth to allow of the large root development necessary for\r\nlarge crops. These farmers need larger tools and heavier animals if\r\nthey expect to make much improvement in the yield of their crops.\r\nThese small plows and this shallow plowing have done much to aid the\r\nwashing and gulleying of the hill farms by rain. The shallow layer of\r\nloose soil takes in the rain readily, but as the harder soil beneath\r\ndoes not take the water as readily, the shallow plowed soil soon\r\nfills, then becomes mud, and the whole mass goes down the slope. The\r\nland would wash less if it had not been plowed at all, and least of\r\nall if it were plowed deep, for then there would be a deep reservoir\r\nof loose soil which would be able to hold a large amount of water\r\nuntil the harder lower soil could take care of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKING OUT THE MIDDLES\r\n\r\nSome farmers have a way when getting the land ready for a crop, of\r\nplowing the rows first and then \"breaking out the middles\" or spaces\r\nbetween after the crop is planted. This is a poor practice, as it\r\ninterferes with thorough preparation of the soil. The ground can be\r\nmore thoroughly plowed and broken up before the crop is planted than\r\nafterwards. This practice of leaving the middles interferes with\r\nproper harrowing and after-cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROWING THE LAND UP IN RIDGES\r\n\r\nMany farmers throw the land up into ridges with the plow and then\r\nplant on the ridge. When land is thrown into ridges a greater amount\r\nof surface is exposed to the air and a greater loss of moisture by\r\nevaporation takes place, therefore ridge culture is more wasteful of\r\nsoil water than level culture. For this reason dry soils everywhere\r\nand most soils in dry climates should, wherever practicable, be left\r\nflat. On stiff, heavy soils which are slow to dry out, and on low\r\nbottom lands it may be desirable to ridge the land to get the soil\r\ndried out and warmed quicker in the spring. Late fall and early\r\nplanter truck crops are often planted on the southern slopes of low\r\nridges thrown up with the plow for warmth and protection from cold\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO PLOW\r\n\r\nThe time of plowing will depend somewhat on the nature of the soil,\r\nclimate and the crop.\r\n\r\nMore plowing is done in the spring just before planting spring and\r\nsummer crops than at any other time, excepting in localities that\r\nplant large areas of winter grain and truck. This spring plowing\r\nshould be done early, for the spring plowing tends to dry the loosened\r\nsoil somewhat and allows it to become warm at an earlier date, and at\r\nthe same time the loosened soil tends to hold water in the lower soil\r\nfor future use by the crop and allows the soil to take in spring rains\r\nmore readily. If a cover crop or green manure crop is to be turned\r\nunder in the spring it should be done early so as to prevent the crop\r\nto be turned under from pumping too much water out of the soil and\r\nthus interfering with the growth of the crop for which the land is\r\nbeing prepared.\r\n\r\nThere are some particular advantages to be gained by fall plowing in\r\nheavy soils:\r\n\r\nImmediately after harvest the land is usually dry and easy to work.\r\n\r\nThe soil plowed at this time and left rough is acted upon physically\r\nby frost which pulverizes it, and chemically by rain and air which\r\nrenders plant food available.\r\n\r\nInsects are turned up and exposed to frost and birds.\r\n\r\nA great number of weeds are destroyed and the land is more easily\r\nfitted for crops in the spring. Fall plowing should be done as early\r\nas possible, especially in the dryer regions, to catch all water\r\npossible. It is not advisable to plow sandy soils in the fall lest\r\nplant food be washed out of them.\r\n\r\nWhen possible a cover crop should be put on fall plowed land where\r\nthere is likely to be loss of plant food by leaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARE FALLOW\r\n\r\nThe term \"fallowing\" is sometimes applied to the operation of plowing,\r\nand sometimes the land is left bare without a crop sometime after\r\nplowing; this is called \"bare fallowing\" the land.\r\n\r\nBare fallowing should not be practiced on all soils. It is adapted:\r\n\r\nTo dry climates and dry seasons where it is desirable to catch and\r\nsave every possible drop of rainfall, and where plant food will not be\r\nwashed out of the exposed soils by rains.\r\n\r\nTo heavy clay lands.\r\n\r\nTo lands that are foul with weeds and insects.\r\n\r\nTo sour soils which are sweetened by exposure to air and rain.\r\n\r\nLight sandy soils should not be subjected to bare fallow unless they\r\nare very foul with weeds. They should always be covered with a crop to\r\nprevent loss of plant food by leaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHARROWING AND ROLLING\r\n\r\n\r\nHARROWING\r\n\r\nAfter spading or plowing the next operation in the preparation of the\r\nsoil is generally raking, harrowing or dragging. The objects of these\r\noperations are:\r\n\r\nTo break lumps and clods left by the plow and spade and to further\r\npulverize the soil.\r\n\r\nHarrowing and raking aid in controlling soil ventilation, and put the\r\nsoil in better condition to absorb moisture.\r\n\r\nThey check the loss of moisture by making a mulch of fine loose earth\r\non the surface.\r\n\r\nThe harrow and rake destroy the weeds.\r\n\r\nThe harrow brings about conditions favorable to the even distribution\r\nof seeds.\r\n\r\nIt is also the tool generally used to cover seeds sown broadcast.\r\n\r\nHarrowing is generally done just before planting, and with some crops\r\njust after, to cover seeds or to smooth the ground. Harrowing is also\r\ndone in the first stages of growth of some crops to kill weeds and\r\nmake a soil mulch. The harrow should always follow the plow within a\r\nfew hours unless it is desired to leave the land in a bare fall or\r\nwinter fallow. At other times of the year the lumps of earth are apt\r\nto dry out and become hard and difficult to break. If there is but one\r\nwork team on the farm it is a good plan during the plowing season to\r\nstop the plow in time to harrow the day's plowing before the day's\r\nwork ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARROWS\r\n\r\nThere are several types of harrows in use. They may be classified\r\naccording to the style of their teeth or cutting parts; they are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nRolling cutter harrows.\r\n\r\nSpring-toothed harrows.\r\n\r\nSpike-toothed harrows.\r\n\r\nCoulter-toothed harrows.\r\n\r\nChain harrows.\r\n\r\nBrush harrows.\r\n\r\nPlank or drag harrows.\r\n\r\nThese types vary in the depth to which they cut, and the degree to\r\nwhich they pulverize the soil.\r\n\r\n_Rolling cutter harrows._ Harrows of this type (see Fig. 54) consist\r\nof one or more revolving shafts on which are arranged a number of\r\nconcave disks. These disks are either entire, notched, or made of\r\nseveral pieces fastened together. Examples of these are the disk,\r\ncutaway and spading harrows. These harrows cut and move the soil\r\ndeeper than the other types. They are especially adapted to work on\r\nheavy clay soils.\r\n\r\nThe value of this type of harrow as moisture preservers depends on the\r\nmanner in which they are used. If the disks are so set that they cover\r\nbut a portion of the surface with a mulch of fine earth they leave a\r\nridge exposed to the action of the wind and sun and the rate of\r\nevaporation is greatly increased. The disks should be set at such an\r\nangle that the whole surface shall be stirred or covered. Soils which\r\nneed the disk harrow should generally be gone over again with some\r\nshallower working tool to smooth the surface. An objection to the\r\nrolling cutters is that unless great care is taken they will leave the\r\nland in ridges and valleys.\r\n\r\nThe two gangs of disks throw the earth in opposite directions. They\r\nare generally set to throw it from the centre and the result is a\r\nshallow double furrow the width of the machine. By lapping each time\r\nthe furrow is partially filled, but to get the land smooth a smoothing\r\nharrow should be used after the rolling cutter.\r\n\r\n_Spring-toothed harrows_ (Fig. 55). Spring-toothed harrows with their\r\ncurved spring teeth enter the soil readily, draw moderately easy and\r\npass over obstructions without much difficulty. They are very useful\r\nin new land that is full of roots and stumps and also stony land. They\r\npulverize the soil to an average depth. They leave the soil in ridges.\r\nThe ridges can be leveled by a smoother in the shape of a piece of\r\nplank attached to the rear of the harrow. On newly plowed grass land\r\nthey tend to tear up the sod and leave it on the surface. They also\r\ntend to drag out coarse manures when plowed in.\r\n\r\nThe original and more common form of the spring-toothed harrow is a\r\nfloating harrow when at work. That is, it rests on the points of the\r\nteeth and is dragged or floated over the ground. A newer form of\r\nspring-toothed harrow, sometimes called the fallow cultivator, is\r\nmounted on high wheels and its action is largely controlled by them.\r\nThis form of harrow is claimed to do much better work than the\r\nfloating harrow and may in a large measure displace the rolling\r\ncutter. The weight of this harrow is entirely taken from the soil\r\nexcept in the wheel tracks, and the entire action is that of\r\npulverizing and lightening the soil.\r\n\r\n_Spike-toothed harrows_ (Fig. 56). The teeth of these harrows are\r\nround, square or diamond-shaped spikes fastened into a wood or iron\r\nframe. The teeth are set in a vertical position or are inclined to the\r\nrear. These harrows are shallow in their action; they run easily but\r\ntend to compact the soil more than the other types and are therefore\r\nbetter adapted to loose soils and to finishing off after the work of\r\nthe deep cutting harrows. They are also used for covering seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--SPIKE-TOOTHED HARROWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--A COULTER-TOOTHED HARROW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--A PLANK HARROW.]\r\n\r\n_Coulter-toothed harrows._ The coulter-toothed harrows (Fig. 57) have\r\nteeth resembling the coulter of a plow twisted or bent into various\r\nshapes. The Acme is a good example of this class of harrow. It cuts,\r\nturns and pulverizes the surface soil somewhat after the manner of the\r\nplow. It prepares a fine mulch and leaves an excellent seed bed. It\r\nis an excellent harrow to finish off with after using a rolling\r\ncutter.\r\n\r\n_Chain harrows._ The chain harrow consists of a web of chains linked\r\ntogether. They have a wonderful power for breaking clods and are\r\nuseful for collecting weeds. They shake the dirt from the weeds and\r\nroll them into heaps. Chain harrows tend to compact the soil.\r\n\r\n_Brush harrows._ The brush harrow is a primitive form made by\r\nfastening brush to a long pole. Brush harrows are quite useful for\r\nbrushing in seed and for pulverizing manure broadcasted on grass\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n_Plank harrows._ The plank harrow (see Fig. 58) is made of several\r\nplanks fastened together so that each plank overlaps the next one to\r\nit, like the clapboards of a house. This harrow is as good as a roller\r\nin fining and smoothing the surface soil. It is an excellent tool to\r\nuse alternately with a spike or coulter-toothed harrow on lumpy soil.\r\nThis tool rasps or grinds many of the lumps or clods which slip by the\r\nharrow teeth and presses others into the ground so that the harrow\r\nfollowing can get a grip on them. It is a harrow that can be made on\r\nany farm. This planker is an excellent tool to smooth the surface, for\r\nbroadcasting small seeds and for planting truck crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLING\r\n\r\nThe objects of rolling are:\r\n\r\nTo compress the surface soil so that the harrow will do its work more\r\nefficiently, also to break clods or lumps that may have resisted the\r\naction of the harrow.\r\n\r\nTo smooth the surface of the soil for an even distribution of small\r\nseeds, and to firm the soil around such seeds after they are planted\r\nso that they will keep moist and sprout readily.\r\n\r\nTo give compactness to soils that are light and loose and thus enable\r\nthem to hold moisture and plant food better.\r\n\r\nTo press into the ground the roots of plants partly dislodged by the\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nTo remove the conditions favorable to the development of many kinds of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nTo sink surface stones so that they will not interfere with harvesting\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nLight porous soils may be rolled at any time, but clay soils can be\r\nrolled to advantage only when they are stiff and cloddy.\r\n\r\nSpring-sown grain is often rolled as soon as sown. This is all right\r\nin ordinary spring weather, but if showers are frequent and the soil\r\nis quite moist the rolling should be omitted till after the grain is\r\nup. The same practice will apply to autumn-sown grain also. If the\r\nsoil is dry the rolling helps it to pump water up to the seeds. But if\r\nit is moist and showers are frequent the combined action of the\r\nroller and the rain is to make so thick a crust that many of the seeds\r\nwill not be able to force their way through it or will be smothered by\r\npoor ventilation. After the grain is up the rolling may be done to\r\nadvantage, as it then makes a firm soil about the roots of the plants,\r\na condition of benefit to grain crops.\r\n\r\nThe most simple form of roller is a solid or hollow cylinder of wood\r\nfastened into a frame by which it is drawn. Some rollers have spikes\r\nor blunt attachments fastened to their surfaces for breaking clods. A\r\nroller that is quite popular consists of a cylinder of pressed steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLEAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS ABOUT LEAVES\r\n\r\nWe found in an earlier lesson that all of our farm plants have roots,\r\nstems, leaves, flowers, fruit and seeds. We studied the root first as\r\nbeing the most important part of the plant to the farmer. The seed was\r\nthe next part studied, for that was considered the next most\r\nimportant, because the seed is the main reliance for new plants. The\r\npart next in importance is the leaf and that we will now study.\r\n\r\nIf you will go into the field and observe the leaves on a number of\r\nplants, you will find that the following facts are true:\r\n\r\nThey are all green.\r\n\r\nThey are flat and thin.\r\n\r\nMany of them are very broad.\r\n\r\nSome of the leaves on a single branch are larger than others on the\r\nsame branch, and some have longer stems than others.\r\n\r\nMost of them have a rather dark glossy upper surface and a lighter\r\nrougher under surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.\r\nTo show transpiration. Plant _A_ was set in the sunlight, plant _B_\r\nwas left in the darker part of the room. _A_ has transpired much more\r\nthan _B_, showing that sunlight is necessary for this work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--AMOUNT OF TRANSPIRATION\r\nThis plant transpired within 48 hours an amount of water equal to the\r\ncolored liquid in the bottle standing on the jar, more than 6 ounces.]\r\n\r\nThe leaves on the lower branches of the trees are spread out in a more\r\nor less flat layer and have their glossy surfaces all turned up,\r\nwhile those on branches in the tops of trees or shrubs are arranged\r\nall around the branch, the glossy surface being turned up.\r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for these facts?\r\n\r\nA study of the work of the leaves and the conditions necessary for\r\nthem to perform their work will help us to answer this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USES OF LEAVES TO PLANTS\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--(See Fig. 59). Take a pot or tumbler in which a young\r\nplant is growing, also a piece of pasteboard large enough to cover the\r\ntop of the pot; cut a slit from the edge to the centre of the\r\npasteboard, then place it on the top of the pot, letting the plant\r\nenter the slit. Now close the slit with wax or tallow, making it\r\nperfectly tight about the stem. If the plant is not too large, invert\r\na tumbler over it, letting the edge of the tumbler rest on the\r\npasteboard; if a tumbler is not large enough use a glass jar. If a\r\npotted plant is not convenient a slip or a seedling bean or pea placed\r\nin a tumbler of water will serve the purpose. Prepare several and\r\nplace some in a sunny window and leave others in the room where it is\r\ndarker, and observe them from time to time. In the case of those\r\nplants that were set in the sunny window moisture will be seen\r\ncollecting on the inner surface of the tumbler. Where does this come\r\nfrom? It is absorbed from the soil by the roots and is sent with its\r\nload of dissolved plant food up through the stems to the leaves.\r\nThere most of the water is passed from the leaves to the air and is\r\ncondensed on the sides of the glass. A work of leaves then is to throw\r\noff or to transpire moisture and thus make room for a new supply of\r\nfood-laden moisture. This water is thrown off through little pores or\r\nmouths or stomata which are very small and very numerous on the under\r\nside of the leaf. It will be noticed that the plant not placed in the\r\nsunlight transpires very little moisture, showing that sunlight helps\r\nthe leaves in this work of transpiration.\r\n\r\nHow much water does a plant transpire or throw off from its leaves?\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--(See Fig. 60). Fill a common quart fruit jar or can\r\nwith soil and plant in it a kernel of corn, a bean, a cotton seed or\r\nseed of some other plant. After the plant has grown to be twelve or\r\nfifteen inches high, cut a piece of pasteboard a little larger than\r\nthe top of the jar, cut a hole in the centre as large as the stem of\r\nthe plant and make a slit from edge to centre. Soak the pasteboard in\r\nmelted wax or paraffine candle. Cool it and then place it over the\r\njar, slipping it around the plant stem. Now solder the pasteboard to\r\nthe jar with melted candle making the joints tight all the way around.\r\nThen close up the slit and the hole about the stem. The jar is now\r\ncompletely sealed and there is no way for water to escape except\r\nthrough the plant. The plant should be well watered before the jar is\r\nclosed. Now weigh the jar and set in the sunlight. Weigh again the\r\nnext day. The difference in the two weights will represent the amount\r\nof water transpired by the plant. The weighings may be repeated until\r\nmoisture gives out. If it is desired to continue this experiment some\r\ntime, a small hole should be cut in the pasteboard before it is\r\nfastened to the jar. This hole is for adding water to the jar from\r\ntime to time. The hole should be kept closed with a cork. The amount\r\nof water added should always be weighed and account taken of it in the\r\nfollowing weighings. While this plant is growing it will be well to\r\nwrap the jar with paper to protect the roots from the light.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the amount of water necessary to grow a plant\r\nto maturity is equal to from 300 to 500 times the weight of the plant\r\nwhen dry.\r\n\r\nThis gives us an idea of the very great importance of water to plants.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take a few leaves from a plant of cotton, bean, clover\r\nor other plant that has been growing in the sunlight; boil them for a\r\nfew minutes to soften the tissues, then place them in alcohol for a\r\nday or until the green coloring matter is extracted by the alcohol.\r\nWash the leaves by taking them from the alcohol and putting them in a\r\ntumbler of water. Then put them in saucers in a weak solution of\r\niodine. The leaf will be seen to gradually darken; this will continue\r\nuntil it becomes dark purple or almost black (Fig. 61). We have\r\nalready learned that iodine turns starch this color, so we conclude\r\nthat leaves must contain starch. (Five or ten cents worth of tincture\r\nof iodine from a drug store diluted to about the color of weak tea\r\nwill be sufficient for these leaf experiments.)\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--If a potted plant was used for the last experiment, set\r\nit away in a dark closet after taking the leaves for the experiment. A\r\nday or two after, take leaves from it before removing it from the\r\ncloset. Boil these leaves and treat them with alcohol as in the\r\nprevious experiment. Then wash them and test them with iodine as\r\nbefore. No starch will be found in the leaves (Fig. 62). The starch\r\nthat was in them when placed in the closet has disappeared. Now paste\r\nsome thick paper labels on some of the leaves of a plant exposed to\r\nthe sunlight. After a few hours remove the leaves that have the labels\r\non them, boil, treat with alcohol and test with the iodine. In this\r\ncase starch will be found in all parts of the leaf except the part\r\nover which the label was pasted (Fig. 63). If the sunlight is intense\r\nand the label thin, some starch will appear under it.\r\n\r\nAccording to these last experiments, leaves contain starch at certain\r\ntimes, and this starch seems to appear when the leaf is in the\r\nsunlight and to disappear when the light is cut off. The fact is that\r\nthe leaves manufacture starch for the plant and sunlight is necessary\r\nfor this work. The starch is then changed to sugar which is carried by\r\nthe sap to other parts of the plant where it is again changed to\r\nstarch to be built into the plant structure or stored for future use.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take leaves from a plant of silver-leaf geranium\r\ngrowing in the sunlight. If this plant cannot be had, the leaves from\r\nsome other variegated white and green leaved plant will do. Boil these\r\nleaves, treat with alcohol, wash and test with iodine (Fig. 64).\r\nStarch will be found in the leaf wherever there was green coloring\r\nmatter in it, while the parts that were white will show no starch. The\r\ngreen coloring matter seems to have something to do with the starch\r\nmaking, in fact starch is manufactured only where it is present. This\r\ncoloring matter is called chlorophyl or leaf green.\r\n\r\nWe are told by the chemists that this starch is made from carbon and\r\nwater. There exists in the air a gas called carbonic acid gas; this\r\ngas is composed of carbon and oxygen. It is breathed out of the lungs\r\nof animals and is produced by the burning and decay of organic matter.\r\nThe under side of the leaf contains hundreds of little pores or mouths\r\ncalled stomata. This gas mixed with air enters these mouths. The green\r\npart of the leaf aided by the sun takes hold of the gas and separates\r\nthe carbon from the oxygen. The oxygen is allowed to go free, but the\r\ncarbon is made to unite with water and form starch.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--The escape of this oxygen gas may be seen by taking\r\nsome water weed from either fresh or salt water and placing it in a\r\nglass jar of the kind of water from which it came, then set the jar in\r\nthe sunlight. After a time bubbles of gas will be seen collecting and\r\nrising to the surface. If a mass of weed like the green scum of fresh\r\nwater ponds or green sea lettuce be used, the bubbles of gas will\r\nbecome entangled in the mass and will cause it to rise to the surface\r\nof the water. At the same time prepare another jar of the weed and\r\nplace it somewhere out of the sun; very few bubbles will be seen to\r\nrise and the weed will settle to the bottom of the jar (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\nAll of the food of the plant, whether taken from the air or from the\r\nsoil is digested in the leaves, and sunlight and air are necessary for\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nAnother function of leaves then is to digest food for the plant.\r\n\r\nImportant functions of leaves then are:\r\n\r\nTo transpire moisture sent up by the roots.\r\n\r\nTo manufacture starch by combining some of the water sent up by the\r\nroots with carbon taken from the air.\r\n\r\nTo digest the starch and food sent up by the roots.\r\n\r\nTo do these things well leaves must be connected with a strong,\r\nhealthy root system and must have plenty of light and air.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to give reasons for the facts about leaves mentioned\r\nin the first part of the chapter (see page 109).\r\n\r\nLeaves are green because the green coloring matter is necessary for\r\nthe leaf to do its work.\r\n\r\nLeaves are flat and thin and broad in order that they may present a\r\nlarge surface to the air and sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.\r\nTo show that growing leaves contain starch. 1. Represents a green\r\ncotton leaf as picked from the plant. 2. Is the same leaf after taking\r\nout the green coloring matter; the leaf is white. 3.

Then\r\nleaf 4 was taken from it; 5 represents this leaf after the chlorophyl\r\nwas taken from it: it is white; 6 is the same after treatment with\r\niodine. The leaf remains white, showing no starch. (Drawings by M.E.\r\nFeltham.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.\r\nTo show that sunlight is necessary for starch-making by leaves. Leaf 7\r\nhad a paper label stuck to its upper surface a couple of hours while\r\nthe plant was exposed to sunlight; 8 is the same leaf after the\r\nchlorophyl was taken out, and 9 represents it after treatment with\r\niodine. The leaf turned purple in all parts except the part that was\r\nshaded by the label. Starch was removed from the portion under the\r\nlabel, but was not renewed because the label kept out the necessary\r\nsunlight. (Drawings by M.E. Feltham.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.\r\nTo show that chlorophyl is necessary for starch formation in the leaf.\r\n10 is a variegated leaf from a silver-leaved geranium; the center is\r\nan irregular patch of green, with an irregular border of white. 11,\r\nafter taking out the green. 12, after iodine treatment, the leaf turns\r\npurple only where it was originally green, showing that no starch\r\nforms in the white border. (Drawings by M.E. Feltham.)]\r\n\r\nSome leaves on the branch are larger than others because in the\r\nstruggle for light and air they have had a better chance than the\r\nothers or they have had more of the food which has come up from the\r\nroot.\r\n\r\nSome of the leaves have developed longer stems than others in their\r\neffort to reach out after light and air.\r\n\r\nMost leaves have the little mouths through which air is taken in and\r\nwater and oxygen given out on the rough side, and that side is turned\r\ndown toward the earth probably so that rain and dust will not choke\r\nthe little pores.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the lower branches tend to spread out in a broad, flat\r\nplane because in the effort to get light no leaf will grow directly\r\nunder and in the shadow of another, while on those branches which grow\r\nstraight up from the top of the tree the leaves can get light from all\r\nsides and so arrange themselves around the stem.\r\n\r\nIs it of any value to the plant grower to know these facts about\r\nleaves? It is, for knowing these things he can better understand the\r\nnecessity of caring for the leaves of his growing plants to see that\r\ntheir work is not interfered with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE WORK OF SOME LEAVES IS INTERFERED WITH\r\n\r\nMany people who grow house plants have trouble in keeping them well\r\nclothed with leaves, for instance, the geranium and the rubber plant.\r\nThe leaves are constantly turning yellow and dropping off or drying\r\nup. This sometimes occurs from over-watering or not sufficiently\r\nwatering the soil in the pot or box. If the watering is all right the\r\ntrouble may occur in this way: The air of the house is quite dry,\r\nespecially in winter. As a result transpiration from the leaf may be\r\nexcessive. More water is transpired than is necessary, consequently\r\nmore is pumped by the roots and with it more food is sent to the leaf\r\nthan it can take care of. As the excess of water is transpired the\r\nexcess of food is left in the leaf. The tendency is to clog its pores\r\nand therefore interfere with its work, and gradually weaken and\r\nfinally kill it. The remedy for this is to spray the leaves frequently\r\nso as to keep the air about them moist and so check transpiration.\r\nKeeping a vessel of water near them helps also as this tends to keep\r\nthe air moist. Dust sometimes chokes the leaves. Washing or spraying\r\nremedies this.\r\n\r\nSometimes house plants, and out-door plants as well, become covered\r\nwith a small, green insect called the plant louse or aphis. This\r\ninsect has a sharp beak like a mosquito and it sucks the juices from\r\nthe leaf and causes it to curl up, interfering with its work and\r\nfinally killing it. Frequent spraying with water will tend to keep\r\nthese away. A surer remedy against them is to spray the plants with\r\nweak tobacco water made by soaking tobacco or snuff in water, or to\r\nfumigate them with tobacco smoke. Sometimes the under side of the\r\nleaf becomes infested with a very small mite called red spider\r\nbecause it spins a web. These mites injure the leaf by sucking sap\r\nfrom it. They can be kept in check by frequent spraying for they do\r\nnot like water. If, then, we are careful to frequently spray the\r\nleaves of our house plants we will have very little trouble from\r\naphis, red spider or over transpiration. The aphis, or plant louse, is\r\noften very numerous on out-door plants, for instance, the rose,\r\nchrysanthemum, cabbage, and fruit trees. They vary in color from green\r\nto dark brown or black. They are treated in the same way as those on\r\nthe house plants. Some familiar out-door insects which interfere with\r\nleaf work are the common potato bug, the green cabbage worm, the rose\r\nslug, the elm tree leaf beetle, the canker worm, the tomato worm.\r\nThese insects and many others eat the leaves (Fig. 67). They chew and\r\nswallow their food and are called chewing insects. All insects which\r\nchew the leaves of plants can be destroyed by putting poison on their\r\nfood. The common poisons used for this purpose are Paris green and\r\nLondon purple, which contain arsenic, and are used at the rate of one\r\nteaspoonful to a pail of water or one-fourth pound to a barrel of\r\nwater. This is sprinkled or sprayed on the leaves of the plants.\r\nAnother poison used is white hellebore. This loses its poisoning\r\nqualities when exposed to the air for a time. Therefore it is safer to\r\nuse about the flower garden and on plants which are soon to be used as\r\nfood or whose fruit is to be used soon, like cabbages and current\r\nbushes. This hellebore is sifted on the plant full strength, or it may\r\nbe diluted by mixing one part of hellebore with one or two parts of\r\nflour, plaster, or lime. It is also used in water, putting one ounce\r\nof hellebore in three gallons of water and then spraying it on the\r\nplants. Plants may be sprayed by using a watering pot with a fine rose\r\nor sprinkler, or an old hair-brush or clothes-brush. For large plants\r\nor large numbers of smaller plants spray pumps of various sizes are\r\nused. Sometimes chewing insects on food plants and sucking insects on\r\nall plants are treated by spraying them with soapy solutions or oily\r\nsolutions which injure their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe work of the leaf is also interfered with by diseases which attack\r\nthe leaves and cause parts or the whole leaf to turn yellow or brown\r\nor become blistered or filled with holes. The common remedy for most\r\nof these diseases is called the \"Bordeaux Mixture.\" It is prepared as\r\nfollows: Dissolve four pounds of blue vitriol (blue stone, or copper\r\nsulphate) in several gallons of water. Then slake four pounds of lime.\r\nMix the two and add enough water to make a barrelful. The mixture is\r\nthen sprayed on the plants.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed directions for spraying plants and combating insects\r\nand diseases write to your State Experiment Station and to the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture at Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.\r\nTo show the giving off of gas by leaves, and that sunlight is\r\nnecessary for it. The jars contain seaweed. _A_ was set in the sun and\r\ndeveloped enough gas to float part of the plant. _B_ was left in the\r\ndarker part of the room and developed very little gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.\r\nSeedling radishes reaching for light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.\r\nElm leaves injured by the \"imported elm-tree leaf beetle,\" a chewing\r\ninsect.]\r\n\r\nThe work of the leaves of house plants is often interfered with by not\r\ngiving them sufficient sunlight. Garden and field plants are\r\nsometimes planted so thick that they crowd each other and shut the\r\nlight and air from each other, or weeds are allowed to grow and do the\r\nsame thing, the result being that the leaves cannot do good work and\r\nthe plant becomes weak and sickly. Weeds are destroyed by pulling them\r\nup and exposing their roots to the sun. This should be done before the\r\nweeds blossom, to prevent them from producing fresh seeds for a new\r\ncrop of weeds. Some weeds have fleshy roots--for example, dock,\r\nthistle--in which food is stored; these roots go deep in the ground,\r\nand when the upper part of the plant is cut or broken off the root\r\nsends up new shoots to take the place of the old. Some have\r\nunderground stems in which food is stored for the same purpose. The\r\nsurest way to get rid of such weeds, in fact, of all weeds, is to\r\nprevent their leaves from growing and making starch and digesting food\r\nfor them. This is accomplished by constantly cutting off the young\r\nshoots as soon as they appear above the soil, or by growing some crop\r\nthat will smother them. The constant effort to make new growth will\r\nsoon exhaust the supply of stored food and the weed will die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE STEMS FOR?\r\n\r\nVisit the farm or garden and the fields to examine stems and study\r\ntheir general appearances and habits of growth. Notice that many\r\nplants, like the trees, bushes and many vegetable and flowering\r\nplants, have stems which are very much branched, while others have\r\napparently single stems with but few or no branches. Examine these\r\nstems carefully and note that there are leaves on some part of all of\r\nthem and that just above the point where each leaf is fastened to the\r\nstem there is a bud which may sometime produce a new branch (Fig. 68).\r\nIf the stems of trees and other woody plants be examined in the winter\r\nafter the leaves have fallen, it will be seen that the buds are still\r\nthere, and that just below each bud is a mark or leaf scar left by the\r\nfallen leaf. These buds are the beginnings of new branches for another\r\nyear's growth. On some branches will be found also flowers and fruit\r\nor seed vessels.\r\n\r\nBuds and leaves or buds and leaf scars distinguish stems from roots.\r\nSome plants have stems under the soil as well as above it. These\r\nunderground stems resemble roots but can be distinguished from them by\r\nthe rings or joints where will be found buds and small scale-like\r\nleaves (Fig. 69). Quitch-grass or wiregrass, Burmuda grass, white\r\npotato and artichoke are examples of underground stems.\r\n\r\nNow study the habit of growth of these stems. Notice that:\r\n\r\nSome plants grow erect with strong, stiff stems, for example, corn,\r\nsunflower, maple, pine, elm and other trees. Many of these erect stems\r\nhave branches reaching out into the air in all directions. Stand under\r\na tree close to the stem or trunk and look up into the tree and notice\r\nthat the leaves are near the outer ends of the branches while in the\r\ncentre of the tree the branches are nearly bare. Why is this? If you\r\nremember the work of leaves and the conditions necessary for their\r\nwork you will be able to answer this question. Leaves need light and\r\nair for their work, and these erect, branching stems hold the leaves\r\nup and spread them out in the light and air.\r\n\r\nNotice that where several trees grow close together, they are\r\none-sided, and that the longest and largest branches are on the\r\noutside of the group and that they have more leaves than the inner\r\nbranches. Why? Why do the trees in thick woods have most of the living\r\nbranches and bear most of their leaves away up in the top of the tree?\r\n\r\nSome stems instead of standing up erect climb up on other plants or\r\nobjects by means of springlike tendrils which twist about the object\r\nand so hold up the slender stem. On the grape vine these tendrils are\r\nslender branches. On the sweet pea and garden pea they are parts of\r\nthe leaves. The trumpet creeper and English ivy climb by means of air\r\nroots. The nasturtium climbs by means of its leaf stems.\r\n\r\nOther stems get up into the light and air with their leaves by twining\r\nabout upright objects. For example, the morning glory and pole bean.\r\n\r\nSome stems will be found that spread their leaves out to the sun by\r\ncreeping over the ground. Sweet potato, melon, squash, and cucumber\r\nvines are examples of such plants.\r\n\r\nOne use of the stems of plants then is to support the leaves, flowers\r\nand fruit, and expose them to the much needed light and air.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Get a piece of grape vine and cut it into pieces four\r\nor five inches long; notice that the cut surface appears to be full of\r\nlittle holes. Cut a piece from between joints, place one end in your\r\nmouth and blow hard. It will be found that air can be blown through\r\nthe piece of vine. Now pour about an inch of water in a tumbler or cup\r\nand color it with a few drops of red ink. Then stand some of the\r\npieces of grape vine in the colored water. In a few hours the colored\r\nwater will appear at the upper ends of the sticks. Capillary force has\r\ncaused the colored water to rise through the small tubes in the vine.\r\nRepeat this experiment with twigs of several kinds of trees and soft\r\ngreen plants, as elm, maple, sunflower, corn, etc. It will not be\r\npossible to blow through these twigs, but the red water will rise\r\nthrough them by osmose, and in a few hours will appear at the upper\r\nends. If some leaves are left on the stems the colored water will\r\nappear in them. Some white flowers can be colored in this way.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the stem carries plant food dissolved in water from the\r\nroots to the leaves, and after the leaves have digested it carries it\r\nback to various parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe stem then serves as a conductor or a passage for food and moisture\r\nbetween roots and leaves.\r\n\r\nVisit a strawberry bed or search for wild strawberry plants. Notice\r\nthat from the older and larger plants are sent out long, slender,\r\nleafless stems with a bud at the tip. These stems are called runners.\r\nFind some runners that have formed roots at the tip and have developed\r\na tuft of leaves there, forming new plants. Find some black raspberry\r\nplants and notice that some of the canes have bent over and taken root\r\nat the tips sending up a new shoot and thus forming a new plant. You\r\nknow how rapidly wire grass and Bermuda grass will overrun the garden\r\nor farm. One way in which they do this is by sending out underground\r\nstems which take root at the joints and so form new plants.\r\n\r\nAnother use of the stem then is to produce new plants.\r\n\r\nOn the farm we make use of this habit of stems when we wish to\r\nproduce new white potato plants. We cut an old potato in pieces and\r\nplant them. The buds in the eyes grow and form new plants. One way of\r\ngetting new grape plants is to take a ripened vine in the fall and cut\r\nit in pieces with two or three buds and plant them so that one or both\r\nof the buds are covered with soil. The pieces will take root and in\r\nthe spring will send up new shoots and thus form new plants.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain new plants from geranium, verbena, nasturtium and many\r\nother flowering plants, by cutting and planting slips or parts of the\r\nstems from them.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the South new sweet potato plants are obtained by cutting\r\nparts of the stems from growing plants and planting them.\r\n\r\nFlorists produce large numbers of new plants by taking advantage of\r\nthis function of stems.\r\n\r\n=Experiment.=--Take a white potato which is a thickened stem and place\r\nit in a warm, dark place. It will soon begin to sprout or send out new\r\nstems, and as these new stems grow the potato shrinks and shrivels up.\r\nWhy is this? It is because the starch and other material stored in the\r\npotato are being used to feed the new branches. When we plant potatoes\r\nin the garden and field the new plants produced from the eyes of the\r\npotato are fed by the stored material until they strike root and are\r\nable to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nAll stems store food for the future use of the plant.\r\n\r\nAnnual plants, or those which live but one year, store food in their\r\nstems and leaves during the early part of their growth. During the\r\nfruiting or seed forming season this food material is transferred to\r\nthe seeds and there stored, and the stems become woody. This is a fact\r\nto bear in mind in connection with the harvesting of hay or other\r\nfodder crops. If we let the grass stand until the seeds form in the\r\nhead, the stem and leaves send their nourishment to the seeds and\r\nbecome woody and of less value than if cut before the seeds are fully\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIn plants of more than one year's growth the stored food is used to\r\ngive the plant a start the following season, or for seed production.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of leaf and twig on trees and shrubs in spring is\r\nmade from the food stored in the stem the season before.\r\n\r\nSago is a form of starch stored in the stem of the sago palm for the\r\nfuture use of the plant.\r\n\r\nMaple sugar is made from the food material stored in the trunk of the\r\nmaple tree for the rapid growth of twig and leaf in the spring.\r\n\r\nCane sugar is the food stored in the sugar cane to produce new plants\r\nthe next season.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the stem of a tree that has been cut down we find that\r\nit is woody, that the wood is arranged in rings or layers and that the\r\nouter part of the stem is covered with bark. We will notice also that\r\nthe wood near the centre of the tree is darker than the outer part.\r\nThis inner part is called the heart wood of the tree. The lighter\r\nwood is called the sap wood. It is through the outer or sap wood that\r\nthe water taken in by the root is passed up to the leaves where the\r\nfood which it carries is digested and then sent back to the plant. The\r\nreturning digested food is sent back largely through the bark. Between\r\nthe bark and the wood is a very thin layer which is called cambium.\r\nThis is the active growing tissue of the stem. In the spring it is\r\nvery soft and slippery and causes the bark to peel off easily. This\r\ncambium builds a new ring of wood outside of the old wood and a new\r\nring of bark on the inside of the bark. In this way the tree grows in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nNow if the bark is injured, or any part of the stem, all parts below\r\nthe wound are cut off from the return supply of digested food and\r\ntheir growth is checked. When such a wound does occur, or if a wound\r\nis made by cutting off a branch, the cambium sets to work to repair\r\nthe damage by pushing out a new growth which tends to cover the wound.\r\nWe can help this by covering the wound and keeping the air from it to\r\nprevent its drying and to keep disease from attacking it before it is\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE WORK OF THE STEM MAY BE INTERFERED WITH\r\n\r\nIf there are any peach trees near by, examine the trunks close to the\r\nground, even pulling away the soil for a few inches. You will very\r\nlikely find a mass of gummy substance oozing from the tree. Pull this\r\naway and in it and in the wood under it will be found one or more\r\nyellowish white worms. These are tree borers. They will be found in\r\nalmost all peach trees. They interfere with the work of the stem and\r\nin many cases kill the trees. These worms may be kept somewhat in\r\ncheck by keeping papers wrapped about the lower part of the tree. But\r\nthe surest way to keep them in check is to dig them out, spring and\r\nfall, with a knife and wire.\r\n\r\nBorers attack the other fruit trees and also ornamental trees and\r\nshrubs.\r\n\r\nRabbits sometimes gnaw the bark from trees during severe winters.\r\n\r\nCareless workmen sometimes injure the bark of trees by allowing plows\r\nand mowing machines or other tools which they are using among them to\r\ncome in contact with the trees and injure the bark.\r\n\r\nYoung trees purchased from the nursery generally have a label fastened\r\nto them with a piece of wire. Unless this wire is removed or is\r\ncarefully watched and enlarged from time to time it will cut into the\r\nbark as the stem grows and interfere with its work and often kill the\r\ntop of the tree or injure a main branch.\r\n\r\nThese are a few ways in which the work of the stem is sometimes\r\nchecked and the plant injured thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFLOWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our study of the parts of plants the flower and fruit have been\r\ngiven the last place because in the growing of most farm plants a\r\nknowledge of the functions of the flower is of less importance than\r\nthat of the roots, leaves and stems. However, a knowledge of these\r\nparts is necessary for successful fruit culture and some other\r\nhorticultural industries.\r\n\r\nAs with the other parts of the plant our study will not be exhaustive\r\nbut will be simply an attempt to bring out one or two important truths\r\nof value to most farmers.\r\n\r\nIn the study of flowers the specimens used for study will depend upon\r\nthe time of the year in which the studies are made and need not\r\nnecessarily be the ones used here for illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTION OR USE OF FLOWERS TO PLANTS\r\n\r\nOf what use is the flower to the plant?\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless noticed that most flowers are followed by fruit or\r\nseed vessels. In fact, the fruit and seeds are really produced from\r\nthe flower, and the work of most flowers is to produce seeds in order\r\nto provide for new plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.\r\nA horse-chestnut stem showing leaves, buds, and scars where last\r\nyear's leaves dropped off.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--AN UNDERGROUND STEM\r\nBuds show distinctly at points indicated by _b_.]\r\n\r\nTo understand how this comes about it will be necessary to study the\r\nparts of the flower and find out their individual uses or functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTS OF A FLOWER\r\n\r\nIf we take for our study any of the following flowers: cherry, apple,\r\nbuttercup, wild mustard, and start from the outside, we will find an\r\nouter and under part which in most flowers is green. This is called\r\nthe calyx (Figs. 70-74). In the buttercup and mustard the calyx is\r\ndivided into separate parts called sepals. In the cherry, peach and\r\napple, the calyx is a cup or tube with the upper edge divided into\r\nlobes.\r\n\r\nAbove the calyx is a broad spreading corolla which is white or\r\nbrightly colored and is divided into several distinct parts called\r\npetals. The petals of one kind of flower are generally different in\r\nshape, size and color from those of other flowers. In some flowers the\r\npetals are united into a corolla of one piece which may be\r\nfunnel-shaped, as in the morning glory or petunia of the garden, or\r\ntubular as in the honeysuckle, wheel-shaped as in the tomato and\r\npotato, or of various other forms.\r\n\r\nWithin the corolla are found several bodies having long, slender stems\r\nwith yellow knobs on their tips. These are called stamens. The slender\r\nstems are called stalks or filaments and the knobs anthers. The\r\nanthers of some of the stamens will very likely be found covered with\r\na fine, yellow powder called pollen. This pollen is produced within\r\nthe anther which, when ripe, bursts and discharges the pollen.\r\n\r\nThe stamens vary greatly in number in different kinds of flowers. In\r\nthe centre of the cherry, peach, or mustard flower will be found an\r\nupright slender body called the pistil. In the peach and cherry the\r\npistil has three parts, a lower rounded, somewhat swollen part called\r\nthe ovary, a slender stem arising from it called the style, and a\r\nslight enlargement at the top of the style called the stigma. The\r\nstigma is generally roughened or sticky. If the ovary is split open,\r\nwithin it will be found a little body called an ovule, which is to\r\ndevelop into a seed.\r\n\r\nIn the apple flower the pistils will be found to have one ovary with\r\nfive styles and stigmas and in the ovary will be several ovules.\r\n\r\nIn the buttercup will be found a large number of small pistils, each\r\nconsisting of an ovary and stigma.\r\n\r\nThe parts of different flowers will be found to vary in color, in\r\nshape, in relative size and in number. In some flowers one or more of\r\nthe parts will be found wanting.\r\n\r\nExamine a number of flowers and find the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS OF THE PARTS OF THE FLOWERS\r\n\r\nNow what are the uses of these parts of the flower?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--FLOWER OF CHERRY.\r\n_a_, pistil; _b_, stamen; _c_, corolla; _d_, calyx; _e_, section of\r\nflower showing ovary with ovule.

(Drawing by\r\nM.E. Feltham.)]\r\n\r\nIf we watch a flower of the peach or cherry from week to week, we will\r\nsee that the pistil develops into a peach or cherry which bears within\r\na seed from which a new plant will be produced if the seed is\r\nplaced under conditions necessary for germination or sprouting.\r\n\r\nThe pistils of the flowers of other plants will be found to develop\r\ninto fleshy fruits, hard nuts, dry pods or husks containing one or\r\nmore seeds.\r\n\r\nThe work of the pistil or pistils of flowers then is to furnish seeds\r\nfor the production of new plants.\r\n\r\nThe botanists tell us that a pistil will not produce seeds unless it\r\nis fertilized by pollen from the same kind of flower falling on its\r\nstigma.\r\n\r\nThe work of the stamen then is to produce pollen to fertilize the\r\npistils. Pistils and stamens are both necessary for the production of\r\nfruit and seed. They are therefore called the essential or necessary\r\nparts of the flower.\r\n\r\nThe botanists also tell us that nature has provided that in most cases\r\nthe pistils shall be fertilized by the pollen of some other flower\r\nthan their own, as this produces stronger seeds.\r\n\r\nHow is the pollen carried from flower to flower?\r\n\r\nGo into the garden or field and watch the bees and butterflies flying\r\nabout the flowers, resting on them and crawling into them. They are\r\nseeking for nectar which the flower secretes. As they visit plant\r\nafter plant, feeding from many flowers, their bodies become more or\r\nless covered with pollen as they brush over the stamens. Some of this\r\npollen in turn gets rubbed off on the stigmas of the pistils and they\r\nbecome fertilized. Thus the bees and some other insects have become\r\nnecessary as pollen carriers for some of the flowers and the flowers\r\nin turn feed them with sweet nectar.\r\n\r\nThis gives us a hint as to one use of the corollas which spreads out\r\nsuch broad, brightly-colored, conspicuous petals. It must be that they\r\nare advertisements or sign boards to attract the bees and to tell them\r\nwhere they can find nectar and so lead them unconsciously to carry\r\npollen from flower to flower to fertilize the pistils. The act of\r\ncarrying pollen to the pistil is called pollination, and carrying\r\npollen from the stamens of one flower to the pistil of another flower\r\nis called cross pollination.\r\n\r\nIf we examine a blossom bud just before it opens we will see only the\r\ncalyx. Everything else will be wrapped up inside of it. Evidently,\r\nthen, the calyx is a protecting covering for the other parts of the\r\nflower until blossoming time.\r\n\r\nThe corolla will be found carefully folded within the calyx and also\r\nhelps protect the stamens and pistil.\r\n\r\nSome flowers do not produce bright-colored corollas to attract the\r\nbees, for examples, the flowers of the grasses, wheat, corn, and other\r\ngrains, the willows, butternuts, elms, pines and others. But they\r\nproduce large amounts of pollen which is carried by the wind to the\r\npistils.\r\n\r\nYou have sometimes noticed in the spring that after a rain the pools\r\nof water are surrounded by a ring of yellow powder and you have\r\nperhaps thought it was sulphur. It was not sulphur but was composed of\r\nmillions of pollen grains from flowers. One spring Sunday I laid my\r\nhat on the seat in church. When I picked it up at the end of the\r\nservice I found considerable dust on it. I brushed the dust off, but\r\non reaching home I found some remaining and noticed that is was\r\nyellow, so I examined it with a magnifying glass and found that it was\r\nnearly all pollen grains. Then I rubbed my finger across a shelf in my\r\nroom and found it slightly dusty; the magnifying glass showed me that\r\nthis dust was half pollen. This shows what a great amount of pollen is\r\nproduced and discharged into the air, and it shows that very few\r\npistils could escape even if they were under cover of a building.\r\n\r\nTo make sure of cross pollination nature has in some cases placed the\r\nstamens and pistils in different flowers on the same plant. This will\r\nbe found true of the flowers of the squashes, melons and cucumber.\r\nBelow some of the flower buds will be seen a little squash, melon or\r\ncucumber (Fig. 75). These are the ovaries of pistils and the stigmas\r\nwill be found within the bud or will be seen when the bud opens. But\r\nno stamen will be found here. Other flowers on these plants will be\r\nfound to possess only stamens. These staminate flowers produce pollen\r\nand then die. They do not produce any fruit, but their pollen is\r\nnecessary for the little cucumbers, squashes and melons to develop.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the corn plant. Here the pistils are on the ear,\r\nthe corn silk being the styles and stigmas, while the pollen is\r\nproduced in the tassel at the top of the plant.\r\n\r\nWith some plants we find that not only are the pistils and stamens in\r\nseparate flowers but the staminate and pistilate flowers are placed on\r\ndifferent plants. This will be found true of the osage orange and the\r\nwillow.\r\n\r\nIn many flowers that have both stamens and pistils or are perfect\r\nflowers the stigmas and pollen ripen at different times.\r\n\r\nWith some varieties of fruit it is found that the pistils cannot be\r\nfertilized by pollen of the same variety. This is true of most of our\r\nnative plums. For example, the pistils of the wild goose plum cannot\r\nbe fertilized by pollen of wild goose plums even if it comes from\r\nother trees than the one bearing the pistils. They must have pollen\r\nfrom another variety of plum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF THE FLOWER\r\n\r\nMany times it happens that a farmer or a gardener wants to start a\r\nstrawberry bed and buys plants of a variety of berries that have the\r\nreputation of being very productive. He plants them and cultivates\r\nthem carefully, and at the proper time they blossom very freely, and\r\nthere is promise of a large crop, yet very few berries appear and this\r\ncontinues to be the case. Not satisfied with them he buys another\r\nvariety and plants near them, and after that the old bed becomes very\r\nproductive. Now why is this? It happens that the flowers of some\r\nvarieties of strawberries have a great many pistils but no stamens,\r\nor very few stamens, and there is not pollen enough to fertilize all\r\nof the blossoms, and when such a variety is planted it is necessary to\r\nplant near it some variety that produces many stamens and therefore\r\npollen enough to fertilize both varieties in order to be sure of a\r\ncrop. Those strawberries which produce flowers with only pistils are\r\ncalled pistilate varieties, while those with both stamens and pistils\r\nare called perfect varieties (Fig. 78). In planting them there should\r\nbe at least one row of a perfect variety to every four or five\r\npistilate rows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.\r\nA magnolia flower showing central column of pistils and stamens, the\r\npistils being above and the stamens below them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--FLOWERS OF SQUASH.\r\n_A_, pistillate flower; _B_, staminate flower. A means of insuring\r\ncross-pollination.]\r\n\r\nWe have learned that certain varieties of plums cannot be fertilized\r\nby pollen from the same variety, and to make them fruitful some other\r\nvariety must be planted among them to produce pollen that will make\r\nthem fruitful. This is more or less true of all our fruits. Therefore\r\nit is not best generally to plant one variety of fruit by itself. Not\r\nknowing this some orchardists have planted large blocks of a single\r\nvariety of fruit which has been unfruitful till some other varieties\r\nhave been planted near them or among them.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the necessity of pollination is very important to those\r\ngardeners who grow cucumbers, tomatoes, melons and other fruiting\r\nplants in greenhouses. Here in most cases the pollination is done by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that nature provides that most of the flowers shall be\r\ncross pollinated. This is particularly true of the flowers of the\r\nfruit trees, and for this reason it is impossible to get true\r\nvarieties of fruit from seed. For example, if we plant seeds of the\r\nwine sap apple, the new trees produced from them will not produce the\r\nsame kind of apple but each tree will produce something different and\r\nthey will very likely all be poorer than the parent fruit. This is\r\nbecause of the mixture of pollens which fertilize the pistils. Knowing\r\nthis fact the nurseryman plants apple seeds and grows apple seedlings.\r\nWhen these get to be the size of a lead pencil he grafts them, that\r\nis, he digs them up, cuts off the tops away down to the root and then\r\ntakes twigs from the variety he wishes to grow and sets or splices\r\nthese twigs in the roots of the seedlings and then plants them. The\r\nroot and the new top unite and produce a tree that bears the same kind\r\nof fruit as that produced by the tree from which the twig was taken.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the reasons why it is well to know something about\r\nflowers and their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--FLOWER OF A LILY.\r\nNotice how the stigma and the anthers are kept as far as possible from\r\neach other to guard against self-pollination and to insure\r\ncross-pollination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.\r\nBud and flower of jewel-weed, or \"touch-me-not.\" _A._ Interior of bud.\r\nStamens are seen, but there appears to be no pistil. _B._ Section of\r\nbud showing the pistil concealed behind the stamens. _C._ Bee entering\r\nflower comes in contact with stamens and is loaded with pollen. _D._\r\nSame bee entering older flower.

Feltham.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT\r\n\r\nThe pistil develops and forms the fruit of the plant. This fruit bears\r\nseed for the production of new plants. This fruit may be a dry pod\r\nlike the bean or pea, or it may be a fleshy fruit like the apple or\r\nplum. Now the developing pistil or fruit may be checked in its work of\r\nseed production by insects and diseases, and to secure good fruit it\r\nis in many cases necessary to spray the fruits just as the leaves\r\nare sprayed, to keep these insects and diseases in check.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of most plants, like the leaves, need light and air for\r\ntheir best development, and it sometimes happens that the branches of\r\nthe fruit trees grow so thick that the fruits do not get sufficient\r\nlight and air. This makes it necessary to thin the branches or in\r\nother words to prune the tree. Some trees also start more fruit than\r\nthey can properly feed and as a result the ripened fruits are small\r\nand the tree is weakened. This makes it necessary to thin the fruits\r\nwhile they are young and undeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nSoil Fertility as Affected by Farm Operations and Farm Practices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BOOK OF FARMING\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n_Soil Fertility as Affected by Farm Operations and Farm Practices_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA FERTILE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a fertile soil?\r\n\r\nThe expression a fertile soil is often used as meaning a soil that is\r\nrich in plant food. In its broader and truer meaning a fertile soil is\r\none in which are found all the conditions necessary to the growth and\r\ndevelopment of plant roots.\r\n\r\nThese conditions, as learned in Chapter II, are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe root must have a firm yet mellow soil.\r\n\r\nIt must be well supplied with moisture.\r\n\r\nIt must be well supplied with air.\r\n\r\nIt must have a certain amount of heat.\r\n\r\nIt must be supplied with available plant food.\r\n\r\nIn order to furnish these needs or conditions the soil must possess\r\ncertain characteristics or properties.\r\n\r\nThese properties may be grouped under three heads:\r\n\r\nPhysical properties; the moisture, heat and air conditions needed by\r\nthe roots.\r\n\r\nBiological properties; the work of very minute living organisms in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nChemical properties; plant food in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A FERTILE SOIL\r\n\r\nThree very important physical properties of a fertile soil are its\r\n\r\n  Power to take water falling on the surface.\r\n  Power to absorb water from below.\r\n  Power to hold water.\r\n\r\nThe fertile soil must possess all three of these powers. The relative\r\ndegrees to which these three powers or properties are possessed\r\ndetermine more than anything else the kind of crops or the class of\r\ncrops that will grow best on a given soil.\r\n\r\nThese powers depend, as we learned in Chapter IV, on the texture of\r\nthe soil or the relative amounts of sand, silt, clay and humus\r\ncontained in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe power of admitting a free circulation of air through its pores is\r\nalso an important property of a fertile soil, for air is necessary to\r\nthe life and growth of the roots. This property is dependent also on\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nTwo other important properties of a fertile soil are power to absorb\r\nand power to hold heat. These depend upon the power of the soil to\r\ntake in warm rain and warm air, and also upon density and color. The\r\ndenser or more compact soil and the darker soil having greater power\r\nto absorb heat.\r\n\r\nThe compactness of the soil which gives it greater powers to absorb\r\nheat weakens its powers to hold it, because the compactness allows\r\nmore rapid conduction of heat to the surface, where it is lost by\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nThe more moisture a soil holds, the weaker is its heat-holding power,\r\nbecause the heat is used in warming and evaporating water from the\r\nsurface of the soil.\r\n\r\nThese important properties or conditions of moisture, heat and air,\r\nare, as we have seen, dependent on soil texture and color, which in\r\nturn are dependent upon the relative amounts of sand, clay and humus\r\nin the soil. We are able to control soil texture and therefore these\r\nphysical properties to a certain degree by means of tillage and the\r\naddition of organic matter or humus (see Chapter IV).\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF A FERTILE SOIL\r\n\r\nBiology is the story or science of life; and the biological properties\r\nof the soil have to do with living organisms in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe soil of every fertile field is full of very small or microscopic\r\nplants called bacteria or germs. They are said to be microscopic\r\nbecause they are so small that they cannot be seen without the aid of\r\na powerful magnifying glass or microscope. They are so small that it\r\nwould take about 10,000 average-sized soil bacteria or soil germs\r\nplaced side by side to measure one inch.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of three classes of these soil germs is of great\r\nimportance to the farmer. These three classes of germs are:\r\n\r\nNitrogen-fixing germs.\r\n\r\nNitrifying germs.\r\n\r\nDenitrifying germs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN-FIXING GERMS\r\n\r\nWe learned in Chapter VIII that nitrogen is one of the necessary\r\nelements of plant food, and that although the air is four-fifths\r\nnitrogen, most plants must take their nitrogen from the soil. There\r\nis, however, a class of plants called legumes which can use the\r\nnitrogen of the air. Clover, alfalfa, lucern, cowpea, soy bean, snap\r\nbean, vetch and similar plants are legumes. These legumes get the\r\nnitrogen from the air in a very curious and interesting manner. It is\r\ndone through the aid of bacteria or germs.\r\n\r\nCarefully dig up the roots of several legumes and wash the soil from\r\nthem. On the roots will be found many small enlargements like root\r\ngalls; these are called nodules or tubercles. On clover roots these\r\nnodules are about the size of the head of a pin while on the soy bean\r\nand cowpea they are nearly as large as a pea (see Fig. 34). These\r\nnodules are filled with bacteria or germs and these germs have the\r\npower of taking nitrogen from the air which finds its way into the\r\nsoil. After using the nitrogen the germ gives it to the plant which\r\nthen uses it to build stem, leaves and roots. In this way the legumes\r\nare able to make use of the nitrogen of the soil air, and these germs\r\nwhich help them to do it by catching the nitrogen are called\r\nnitrogen-fixing germs.\r\n\r\nThe work of these germs makes it possible for the farmer to grow\r\nnitrogen, so to speak, on the farm.\r\n\r\nBy growing crops of legumes and turning them under to decay in the\r\nsoil, or leaving the roots and stubble to decay after the crop is\r\nharvested, he can furnish the following crop with a supply of nitrogen\r\nin a very cheap manner and lessen the necessity of buying fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRIFYING GERMS\r\n\r\nAlmost all the nitrogen of the soil is locked up in the humus and\r\ncannot in that condition be used by the roots of plants. The nitrogen\r\ncaught by the nitrogen-fixing germs and built into the structure of\r\nleguminous plants which are grown and turned under to feed other\r\nplants cannot be used until the humus, which is produced by their\r\npartial decay, is broken down and the nitrogen built into other\r\nsubstances upon which the root can feed. The breaking down of the\r\nhumus and building of the nitrogen into other substances is the work\r\nof another set of bacteria or germs called nitrifying germs.\r\n\r\nThese nitrifying germs attack the humus, break it down, separate the\r\nnitrogen, cause it to unite with the oxygen of the air and thus build\r\nit into nitric acid which can be used by plant roots. This nitric acid\r\nif not immediately used will unite with lime or potash or soda or\r\nother similar substances and form nitrates, as nitrate of lime,\r\nnitrate of potash or common saltpetre. These nitrates are soluble in\r\nwater and can be easily used by plant roots. If there are no plant\r\nroots to use them they are easily lost by being washed out of the\r\nsoil. The work of the nitrifying germs is called nitrification.\r\n\r\nTo do their work well the nitrogen-fixing germs and the nitrifying\r\ngerms require certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe soil must be moist.\r\n\r\nThe soil must be well ventilated to supply nitrogen for the\r\nnitrogen-fixing germs and oxygen for the nitrifying germs.\r\n\r\nThe soil must be warm. Summer temperature is the most favorable. Their\r\nwork begins and continues slowly at a temperature of about forty-five\r\ndegrees and increases in rapidity as the temperature rises until it\r\nreaches ninety or ninety-five.\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying germs require phosphoric acid, potash and lime in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nDirect sunlight destroys these bacteria, therefore they cannot work at\r\nthe surface of the soil unless it is shaded by a crop.\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that these bacteria or germs work best in the soil\r\nthat has conditions necessary for the growth and development of plant\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENITRIFYING GERMS\r\n\r\nThese germs live on the coarse organic matter of the soil. Like the\r\nnitrifying germs they need oxygen, and when they cannot get it more\r\nreadily elsewhere they take it from the nitric acid and nitrates. This\r\nallows the nitrogen of the nitrates to escape as a free gas into the\r\nair again, and the work of the nitrogen-fixing and nitrifying germs is\r\nundone and the nitrogen is lost. This loss of nitrogen is most apt to\r\noccur when the soil is poorly ventilated, because of its being very\r\ncompact, or when the soil spaces are filled with water. This loss of\r\nnitrogen by denitrification can be checked by keeping the soil well\r\nventilated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF A FERTILE SOIL\r\n\r\nBy the term chemical properties we have reference to the chemical\r\ncomposition of the soil, the chemical changes which take place in the\r\nsoil, and the conditions which influence these changes.\r\n\r\nThe sand, clay and humus of the soil are made up of a great variety of\r\nsubstances. The larger part of these act simply as a mechanical\r\nsupport for the plants and also serve to bring about certain physical\r\nconditions. Only a very small portion of these substances serve as the\r\ndirect food of plants and the chemical conditions of these substances\r\nare of great importance.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VIII we learned that plants are composed of several\r\nelements and that seven necessary elements are taken from the soil.\r\nThese seven are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium,\r\niron and sulphur.\r\n\r\nNow a fertile soil must contain these seven elements of plant food and\r\nthey must be in such form that the plant roots can use them.\r\n\r\nPlant roots can generally get from most soils enough of the magnesium,\r\ncalcium, iron, and sulphur to produce well developed plants. But the\r\nnitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, although they exist in sufficient\r\nquantities in the soil, are often in such a form or condition that the\r\nroots cannot get enough of one or more of them to produce profitable\r\ncrops. For this reason these three elements are of particular\r\nimportance to the farmer for, in order to keep his soil fertile, he\r\nmust so treat it that these elements will be made available or he must\r\nadd more of them to the soil in the proper form or condition.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen in the soil._--Plant roots use nitrogen in the form of\r\nnitric acid and salts of nitrogen called nitrates. But the nitrogen of\r\nthe soil is very largely found in the humus with the roots cannot use.\r\nA chemical change must take place in it and the nitrogen be built into\r\nnitric acid and nitrates. This, we have learned, is done through the\r\naid of the nitrifying germs.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid in the soil._--Phosphorus does not exist pure in the\r\nsoil. The plant finds it as a phosphoric acid united with the other\r\nsubstances forming phosphates. These are often not available to\r\nplants, but can to a certain extent be made available through tillage\r\nand by adding humus to the soil.\r\n\r\n_Potash in the soil._--The plant finds potassium in potash which\r\nexists in the soil. Potash like phosphoric acid often exists in forms\r\nwhich the plant cannot use but may be made available to a certain\r\nextent by tillage, the addition of humus, and the addition of lime to\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n_Lime in the soil._--Most soils contain the element calcium or lime,\r\nthe compound in which it is found, in sufficient quantities for plant\r\nfood. But lime is also of importance to the farmer and plant grower\r\nbecause it is helpful in causing chemical changes in the soil which\r\ntend to prepare the nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash for plant\r\nuse. It is also helpful in changing soil texture.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes which make the plant foods available are\r\ndependent on moisture, heat, and air with its oxygen, and are\r\ntherefore dependent largely on texture, and therefore on tillage.\r\n\r\nWhen good tillage and the addition of organic matter and lime do not\r\nrender available sufficient plant food, then the supply of available\r\nfood may be increased by the application of manure and fertilizers.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that all these classes of properties are necessary to\r\nfurnish all the conditions for root growth.\r\n\r\nThe proper chemical conditions require the presence of both physical\r\nand biological properties and the biological work in the soil\r\nrequires both chemical and physical conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom the farmer's standpoint the physical properties seem to be most\r\nimportant, for the others are dependent on the proper texture,\r\nmoisture, heat and ventilation which are controlled largely by\r\ntillage.\r\n\r\nTherefore the first effort of the farmer to improve the fertility of\r\nhis soil should be to improve his methods of working the soil.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these properties of the fertile soil, and consequently\r\nevery one of the conditions necessary for the growth and development\r\nof plant roots, is influenced in some way by every operation performed\r\non the soil, whether it be plowing, harrowing, cultivating, applying\r\nmanure, growing crops, harvesting, or anything else, and the\r\nthoughtful farmer will frequently ask himself the question: \"How is\r\nthis going to effect the fertility of my soil or the conditions\r\nnecessary for profitable crop production?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF FERTILITY\r\n\r\nThe important factors in maintaining or increasing the fertility of\r\nthe soil are:\r\n\r\nThe mechanical operations of tillage, especially with reference to the\r\ncontrol of soil water.\r\n\r\nThe application of manures and fertilizers, especially with reference\r\nto maintaining a supply of humus and plant food.\r\n\r\nMethods or systems of cropping the soil, with reference to economizing\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSOIL WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more important tillage tools and tillage operations we studied in\r\nChapters XI and XII. They will be noticed here only in connection with\r\ntheir influence over soil water, for in the regulation of this\r\nimportant factor in soil fertility the other conditions of fertility\r\nare also very largely controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\n\"Of all the factors influencing the growth of plants, water is beyond\r\ndoubt the most important,\" and the maintaining of the proper amount of\r\nsoil water is one of the most important problems of the thinking\r\nfarmer in controlling the fertility of his soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nThe decay of mineral and organic matter in the soil, and the\r\nconsequent setting free of plant food, can take place only in the\r\npresence of moisture. The plant food in barn manures and crops plowed\r\nunder for green moisture, can be made available only when there is\r\nsufficient moisture in the soil to permit breaking down and\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe presence of moisture in the soil is necessary for the process of\r\nnitrification to take place.\r\n\r\nSoil moisture is necessary to dissolve plant food. Plant roots can\r\nabsorb food from the soil only when it is in solution, and it seems to\r\nbe necessary that a large quantity of water pass through the plant\r\ntissues to furnish the supply of mineral elements required by growth.\r\n\r\nMoisture is necessary to build plant tissues. The quantity of water\r\nentering into the structure of growing plants varies from sixty to as\r\nhigh as ninety-five per cent, of their total weight.\r\n\r\nDuring the periods of active growth there is a constant giving off of\r\nmoisture by the foliage of plants and this must be made good by water\r\ntaken from the soil by their roots.\r\n\r\nIn a series of experiments at the University of Wisconsin Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, it was found that in raising oats, every ton of\r\ndry matter grown required 522.4 tons of water to produce it; for every\r\nton of dry matter of corn there were required 309.8 tons of water; a\r\nton of dry red clover requires 452.8 tons of water to grow it. At the\r\nCornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, a yield of\r\npotatoes at the rate of 450 bushels per acre represented a water\r\nrequirement of 1310.75 tons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES AND FORMS OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nThe soil which is occupied by the roots of plants receives moisture in\r\nthe form of rain, snow and dew from above and free and capillary water\r\nrising from below.\r\n\r\n\"Free water is that form of water which fills our wells, is found in\r\nthe bottom of holes dug in the ground during wet seasons, and is often\r\nfound standing on the surface of the soil after heavy or long\r\ncontinued rains. It is sometimes called 'ground water' or 'standing\r\nwater,' and flows under the influence of gravity.\" Free water is not\r\nused directly by plants unless they are swamp plants, and its presence\r\nwithin eighteen inches of the surface is injurious to most farm\r\nplants. Free water serves as the main source of supply for capillary\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Capillary water is water which is drawn by capillary force or soaks\r\ninto the spaces between the soil particles and covers these particles\r\nwith a thin film of moisture.\" It is a direct source of water to\r\nplants. Capillary water will flow in any direction in the soil, the\r\ndirection of flow being determined by texture and dryness, the flow\r\nbeing stronger toward the more compact and drier parts. If the soil is\r\nleft lumpy and cloddy then capillary water cannot rise readily from\r\nbelow to take the place of that which is lost by evaporation. If,\r\nhowever, the soil is fine and well pulverized, the water rises freely\r\nand continuously to supply the place of that taken by plant roots or\r\nevaporation from the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH WATER\r\n\r\nSome farm lands contain too much water for the growth of farm crops;\r\nfor example, bottom lands which are so low that water falling on the\r\nsurface cannot run off or soak down into the lower soil. The result is\r\nthat the spaces between the soil particles are most of the time filled\r\nwith water, and this checks ventilation, which is a necessary factor\r\nin soil fertility. This state of affairs occurs also on sloping\r\nuplands which are kept wet by spring water or by seepage water from\r\nhigher lands. Some soils are so close and compact that water falling\r\non the surface finds great difficulty in percolating through them, and\r\ntherefore renders them too wet for profitable cropping during longer\r\nor shorter periods of the year. Nearly all such lands can be improved\r\nby removing the surplus water through drains. (See Chapter XXV.)\r\n\r\nPercolation and ventilation of close compact soils can be improved by\r\nmixing lime and organic matter with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT ENOUGH WATER\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country, particularly the arid and semi-arid\r\nsections of the West, the soil does not receive a sufficient supply\r\nof rain water for the production of profitable yearly crops. These\r\nsoils are rendered unfertile by the lack of this one all important\r\nfactor of fertility. They can be made fertile and productive by\r\nsupplying them with sufficient water through irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe crop-producing power of some lands is lowered even in regions\r\nwhere the rainfall is sufficient, because these lands are not properly\r\nprepared by tillage and the addition of organic matter to absorb and\r\nhold the water that comes to them, or part of the water may be lost or\r\nwasted by lack of proper after-tillage or after-cultivation. This\r\nstate of affairs is of course improved by better preparation to\r\nreceive water before planting the crop and better methods of\r\nafter-cultivation to save the water for the use of the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nAside from what is used by the crops the soil may lose its water in\r\nthe following ways:\r\n\r\nRain water which comes to the soil may be lost by running off over the\r\nsurface of the land. This occurs especially on hilly farms and in the\r\ncase of close, compact soils.\r\n\r\nWater may be lost from the soil by leaching through the lower soil.\r\n\r\nWater may be lost from the soil by evaporation from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe soil may lose water by the growth of weeds which are continually\r\npumping water up by their roots and transpiring it from their leaves\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SOME FARM OPERATIONS INFLUENCE SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nPlowing and soil water. One of the first effects of deeply and\r\nthoroughly plowing a close, compact soil, is that rain will sink into\r\nit readily and not be lost by surface wash. In many parts of the\r\ncountry, especially the South, great damage is done by the surface\r\nwashing and gulleying of sloping fields.\r\n\r\nThe shallow layer of soil stirred up by small plows and practice of\r\nshallow plowing so prevalent in the South takes in the rain readily,\r\nbut as the harder soil beneath does not easily absorb the water the\r\nshallow layer of plowed soil soon fills, then becomes mud, and the\r\nwhole mass goes down the slope. Where the land is plowed deep there is\r\nprepared a deep reservoir of loose soil that is able to hold a large\r\namount of water till the harder lower soil can gradually absorb it.\r\n\r\nThe soil stirred and thoroughly broken by the plow serves not only as\r\na reservoir for the rainfall, but also acts as a mulch over the more\r\ncompact soil below it, thus checking the rapid use of capillary water\r\nto the surface and its consequent loss by evaporation. The plow which\r\nbreaks and pulverizes the soil most thoroughly is the one best adapted\r\nto fit the soil for receiving and holding moisture.\r\n\r\nIf the plowing is not well done or if the land is too dry when plowed\r\nand the soil is left in great coarse lumps and clods, the air\r\ncirculates readily among the clods and takes from them what little\r\nmoisture they may have had and generally the soil is left in a worse\r\ncondition than if it had not been plowed at all.\r\n\r\nFall plowing on rolling land and heavy soil leaving the surface rough\r\nhelps to hold winter snows and rains when they fall, giving to such\r\nfields a more even distribution of soil water in the spring.\r\n\r\nSpring plowing should be done early, before there is much loss of\r\nwater from the surface by evaporation.\r\n\r\nProfessor King, of the University of Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, carried on an experiment to see how much soil water could be\r\nsaved by early plowing. He selected two similar pieces of ground near\r\neach other and tested them for water April 29th. Immediately after\r\ntesting one piece was plowed. Seven days later, May 6th, he tested\r\nthem for water again and found that both had lost some water, but that\r\nthe piece which was not plowed had lost 9.13 pounds more water per\r\nsquare foot of surface than the plowed piece. This means that by\r\nplowing one part a week earlier than the other he saved in it water\r\nequal to a rainfall of nearly two inches or at the rate of nearly 200\r\ntons of water per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOEING, RAKING, HARROWING, AND CULTIVATING\r\n\r\nThese operations when properly and thoroughly done tend to supplement\r\nthe work of the plow in fitting the soil to absorb rain and in making\r\na mulch to check loss by surface evaporation. The entire surface\r\nshould be worked and the soil should be left smooth and not in ridges.\r\nRolling cutters and spring-toothed harrows are apt to leave ridges and\r\nshould have an attachment for smoothing the surface or be followed by\r\na smoothing harrow. Cultivators used to make mulches to save water\r\nshould have many narrow teeth rather than few broad ones. If a large\r\nbroad-toothed tool is used to destroy grass and large weeds it should\r\nbe followed by a smoother to level the ridges and thus lessen the\r\nevaporating surface. The soil should be cultivated as soon after a\r\nrain as it can be safely worked.\r\n\r\nRolling compacts the soil and starts a quicker capillary movement of\r\nwater toward the surface and a consequent loss by evaporation. When\r\ncircumstances will permit, the roller should be followed by a light\r\nharrow to restore the mulch.\r\n\r\nRidging the land tends to lessen the amount of moisture in the soil\r\nbecause it increases the evaporating surface. It should be practiced\r\nonly on wet land or in early spring to secure greater heat.\r\n\r\nDrains placed in wet land remove free water to a lower depth and\r\nincrease the depth of soil occupied by capillary water and therefore\r\nincrease the body of soil available to plant roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES AND SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nHumus, as we learned in Chapter IV, has a very great and therefore\r\nimportant influence over the water-absorbing and water-holding powers\r\nof soils. Therefore, any of the farm practices that tend to increase\r\nor diminish the amount of humus in the soil are to be seriously\r\nconsidered because of the effect on the water content of the soil. For\r\nthis reason the application of barn manures and green crops turned\r\nunder tend to improve the water conditions of most soils.\r\n\r\nThe mixing of heavy applications of coarse manures or organic matter\r\nwith light sandy soils may make them so loose and open that they will\r\nlose moisture rapidly. When this practice is necessary the land should\r\nbe rolled after the application of the manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CROPPING AND SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nConstant tillage hastens the decay of organic matter in the soil.\r\nHence any method or system of cropping which does not occasionally\r\nreturn to the soil a new supply of humus tends to weaken the powers of\r\nthe soil toward water.\r\n\r\nAll of the operations and practices which influence soil water also\r\naffect the other conditions necessary to root growth; namely, texture,\r\nventilation, heat, and plant food, and those operations and practices\r\nwhich properly control and regulate soil water to a large degree\r\ncontrol and regulate soil fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CROPS WITH REFERENCE TO SOIL WATER\r\n\r\nWhile climatic conditions determine the general distribution of\r\nplants, the amount of water which a soil holds and can give up to\r\nplants during the growing season determines very largely the crops to\r\nwhich it is locally best adapted.\r\n\r\nWith crops that can be grown on a wide range of soils the water which\r\nthe soil can furnish largely determines the time of maturing, the\r\nyield, and often the quality of the crop. With such a crop a small\r\nsupply of water tends to hasten maturity at the expense of yield.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato, when wanted for early market and high prices, is\r\ngrown on the light sandy soils called early truck soils. These soils\r\nhold from five to seven per cent, of water. That is, the texture is\r\nsuch that during the early part of the growing season one hundred\r\npounds of this soil is found to hold an average of from five to seven\r\npounds of water under field conditions. This soil, holding little\r\nwater, warms up early and thus hastens growth. Then as the warmer\r\nsummer weather advances, the water supply diminishes, growth is\r\nchecked, and the crop matures rapidly. On account of the small amount\r\nof water and the early checking of growth, the yield of the crop is\r\nless than if grown on a soil holding more water, but the earlier\r\nmaturity makes it possible to realize a much higher price per bushel\r\nfor the crop. A sweet potato grown on such a light soil is dry and\r\nstarchy, a quality which brings a higher price in the northern markets\r\nthan does the moist, soggy potato grown on heavier soils which contain\r\nmore water and produce larger yields.\r\n\r\nEarly white potatoes, early cabbage, water melons, musk-melons,\r\ntomatoes and other early truck and market garden crops are also grown\r\non light soil holding from five to seven per cent. of water. The main\r\ncrop of potatoes and cabbage and the canning crop of tomatoes are\r\ngrown on the loam soils holding from ten to eighteen per cent. of\r\nwater. Such soils produce a later though much larger yield.\r\n\r\nUpland cotton produces best on a deep loam that is capable of\r\nfurnishing a uniform supply of about ten or twelve per cent. of water\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n\r\nSea Island Cotton grows best on a light, sandy soil holding only five\r\nper cent. of water.\r\n\r\nOn light, sandy soils the Upland Cotton produces small plants with\r\nsmall yield of lint, while on clay and bottom land, which are apt to\r\nhave large amounts of water, the plants grow very large and produce\r\nfewer bolls, which are very late in maturing.\r\n\r\nCorn, while it will grow on a wide range of soils, produces best on\r\nloam or moist bottom lands holding about fifteen per cent. of water\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n\r\nThe grasses and small grains do best on cool, firm soils holding\r\neighteen to twenty-two per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nSorghum or \"Molasses Cane\" grows best on good corn soil, while the\r\nsugar cane of the Gulf States requires a soil with twenty-five per\r\ncent. of water for best growth.\r\n\r\nWhile the amount of water which a soil will hold is determined largely\r\nby texture, it is also considerably influenced by the amount and\r\nfrequency of rainfall and the location of the soil as to whether it be\r\nupland or bottom land.\r\n\r\nThe average percentage of water held by a soil during the growing\r\nseason may be approximately determined in the following manner:\r\n\r\nSample the soil in one of the following methods:\r\n\r\nTake to the field a spade, a box that will hold about half a bushel,\r\nand a pint or quart glass jar with a tight cover. If a cultivated\r\nfield, select a place free from grass and weeds. Dig a hole one foot\r\ndeep and about eighteen inches square. Trim one side of the hole\r\nsquare. Now from this side cut a slice about three inches thick and\r\none foot deep, quickly place this in the box and thoroughly break\r\nlumps and mix together, then fill jar and cork tightly.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to take a common half-inch or two-inch carpenter's\r\nauger and bore into the soil with it. Pull it out frequently and put\r\nthe soil which comes up with it into the jar until you have a sample\r\na foot deep. If one boring twelve inches deep does not give sufficient\r\nsoil make another boring or two close by and put all into the jar.\r\n\r\nTake the sample, by whatever method obtained, weigh out ten or twenty\r\nounces of the moist soil and dry it at a temperature just below 212\r\ndegrees. When it is thoroughly dry weigh again. The difference between\r\nthe two weights will be the amount of water held by the sample. Now\r\ndivide this by the weight of the dry sample and the result will be the\r\nper cent. of water held by the soil.\r\n\r\nSeveral samples taken from different parts of the field will give an\r\naverage for the field. Repeat this every week or oftener through the\r\nseason and an approximate estimate of the water-holding capacity of\r\nthe soil will be obtained and consequently an indication of the crops\r\nto which the soil is best adapted.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE.\r\n     Weight of a soil sample, 20 ounces.\r\n     When dried this sample weighs 17¾ ounces.\r\n     20 - 17¾ = 2¼, the water held by the soil.\r\n     2.25 ÷ 17.75 = .12 plus.\r\n\r\nThis soil held a little over twelve per cent. of water. If this soil\r\ncontinues to give about the same result for successive tests during\r\nthe growing season, the results would indicate a soil adapted to\r\ncotton, late truck or corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE AFTER-CULTIVATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"after-cultivation\" is here used in referring to those\r\ntillage operations which are performed after the crop is planted.\r\nSynonymous terms are \"cultivation,\" \"inter-tillage,\" \"working the\r\ncrop.\"\r\n\r\nAfter-cultivation influences the texture, ventilation, heat, plant\r\nfood and moisture factors of fertility, but most particularly the\r\nmoisture factor.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances the greatest benefit derived from\r\nafter-cultivation when properly performed is the saving of soil water\r\nfor the use of the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF WATER BY EVAPORATION\r\n\r\nSoil water is seldom at rest unless the soil be frozen solid. When\r\nrain falls on a fertile soil there is a downward movement of water.\r\nWhen the rain ceases, water begins to evaporate from the surface of\r\nthe soil. Its place is taken by water brought from below by\r\ncapillarity. This is in turn evaporated and replaced by more from\r\nbelow. This process continues with greater or less rapidity according\r\nto the dryness of the air and the compactness of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF WATER THROUGH WEEDS\r\n\r\nWe learned in a former chapter that during their growth farm plants\r\nrequire an amount of water equal to from 300 to 500 times their dry\r\nweight. Weeds require just as much water and some of them probably\r\nmore than the cultivated plants. This water is largely absorbed by the\r\nroots and sent up to the leaves where it is transpired into the air\r\nand is lost from the soil, and therefore is unavailable to the growing\r\ncrop until it again falls onto the soil.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, particularly the semi-arid West, the\r\nrainfall is not sufficient to supply the soil with enough water to\r\ngrow such crops as it could otherwise produce. In the moister regions\r\nthe rainfall is not evenly distributed throughout the growing season,\r\nand there are longer or shorter intervals between rains when the loss\r\nof water through evaporation and weeds is apt to be greater than the\r\nrainfall. For these reasons it is best to check these losses and save\r\nthe water in the soil for the use of the crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING THE WATER\r\n\r\nThis can be done by:\r\n\r\nPreventing the growth of weeds and by checking losses by evaporation\r\nwith a soil mulch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO CULTIVATE\r\n\r\nA seedling plant is easiest killed just as it has started into growth.\r\nThe best time to kill a plant starting from an underground stem or a\r\nroot is just as soon as it appears above the surface in active growth.\r\n\r\nThe best time to cultivate, then, to kill weeds is as soon as the\r\nweeds appear. At this time large numbers can be killed with the least\r\nof effort. Do not let them get to be a week or two old before getting\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nIn planting some crops the ground between the rows becomes trampled\r\nand compact. This results in active capillarity which brings water to\r\nthe surface and it is lost by evaporation.\r\n\r\nEvery rainfall tends to beat the soil particles together and form a\r\ncrust which enables the capillary water to climb to the surface and\r\nescape into the air. This loss by evaporation should be constantly\r\nwatched for and the soil should be stirred and a mulch formed whenever\r\nit becomes compact or a crust is formed.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to cultivate, then, to save water is as soon as weeds\r\nappear or as soon as the surface of the soil becomes compact or\r\ncrusted by trampling, by the beating of rain or from any other cause,\r\nwhether the crop is up or not. The cultivation should start as soon\r\nafter a rain as the soil is dry enough to work safely.\r\n\r\nThe surface soil should always be kept loose and open. The efficacy\r\nof the soil mulch depends on the thoroughness and frequency of the\r\noperation. It is particularly beneficial during long, dry periods.\r\nDuring such times it is not necessary to wait for a rain to compact\r\nthe soil; keep the cultivators going, rain or no rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS FOR AFTER-CULTIVATION\r\n\r\nThe main objects of after-cultivation are to destroy weeds and to form\r\na soil mulch for the purpose of controlling soil moisture. These ends\r\nare secured by shallow surface work. It is not necessary to go more\r\nthan two or three inches deep. Deeper work will injure the roots of\r\nthe crop. Therefore the proper tools for after-cultivation in the\r\ngarden are the hoe and rake and for field work narrow-toothed harrows\r\nand cultivators or horse-hoes which stir the whole surface thoroughly\r\nto a moderate depth. These field tools are supplemented in some cases\r\nby the hand hoe, but over wide areas of country the hoe never enters\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nA light spike-toothed harrow can be used on corn, potatoes, and\r\nsimilar crops, and accomplish the work of cultivation rapidly until\r\nthey get to be from four to six inches high; after that cultivators\r\nwhich work between the rows should be used.\r\n\r\nA very useful class of tools for destroying weeds in the earlier\r\nstages are the so-called \"weeders.\" They somewhat resemble a horse hay\r\nrake and have a number of flexible wire teeth which destroy shallow\r\nrooted weeds but slip around the more firmly rooted plants of the\r\ncrop. These weeders must be used frequently to be of much value, for\r\nafter a weed is well rooted the weeder cannot destroy it.\r\n\r\nThere is a larger class of hand wheel hoes which are very useful in\r\nworking close planted garden and truck crops. They either straddle the\r\nrow, working the soil on both sides at the same time, or, running\r\nbetween the rows, work the soil to a width of from six to eighteen\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nFor best results with the weeder and hand wheel hoes the soil should\r\nbe thoroughly prepared before planting by burying all trash with the\r\nplow and breaking all clods with harrow and roller.\r\n\r\nThe objection made to the deep-working implements, like the plow, is\r\nthat they injure the crop by cutting its feeding roots, and this has\r\nbeen found by careful experiment and observation to diminish the crop.\r\n\r\nSome farmers object to using a light harrow for cultivation in the\r\nearly stages of the crop because they say the harrow will destroy the\r\ncrop as well as the weeds. This danger is not so great as it seems.\r\nThe seeds of the crop are deeper in the soil than the seeds of the\r\nweeds which germinate and appear so quickly. The soil has also been\r\nfirmed about them. Hence they have a firmer hold on the soil and but\r\nfew of them are destroyed if the work is carefully done.\r\n\r\nIn working crops not only should weeds be destroyed but also surplus\r\nplants of the crop, as these have the same effect as weeds; namely,\r\nthey occupy the soil and take plant food and moisture which if left to\r\nfewer plants would produce a larger harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILLING AND RIDGING\r\n\r\nExcept in low, wet ground, the practice of hilling or ridging up crops\r\nis now considered by those who have given the matter thorough study,\r\nto be unnecessary, flat and shallow culture being cheaper. It saves\r\nmore moisture, and for this reason, in the majority of cases, produces\r\nlarger crops.\r\n\r\nSometimes during very long-continued periods of wet weather weeds and\r\ngrass become firmly established among the plants of the crop. Under\r\nsuch circumstances it is necessary to use on the cultivator teeth\r\nhaving long, narrow sweeps that will cut the weeds just beneath the\r\nsurface of the soil. Sometimes a broad-toothed tool is used that will\r\nthrow sufficient soil over the large weeds near the rows to smother\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe condition to be met and the effect of the operation should always\r\nbe given serious thought.\r\n\r\nWe have considered after-cultivation as influencing soil fertility by\r\nchecking a loss of water by evaporation and weed transpiration, and\r\nthis is its main influence but other benefits follow.\r\n\r\nKeeping the surface soil loose and open benefits fertility because it\r\ndirectly aids the absorption of rain, favors ventilation, and has a\r\nbeneficial influence over soil temperature. Indirectly through these\r\nfactors it aids the work of the beneficial soil bacteria and the\r\nchemical changes in the process of preparing plant food for crop use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFARM MANURES\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS OF MANURES AND FERTILIZERS\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II we learned that the roots of plants for their growth and\r\ndevelopment need a soil that is firm yet mellow, moist, warm,\r\nventilated and supplied with plant food. We also learned that of the\r\nplant foods there is often not enough available nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, potash and lime for the needs of the growing plants.\r\n\r\nManures and fertilizers are applied to the soil for their beneficial\r\neffects on these necessary conditions for root growth and therefore to\r\nassist in maintaining soil fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF MANURES AND FERTILIZERS\r\n\r\nManures may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n                 { Barn or stable manures,\r\nFarm manures.    { Green-crop manures,\r\n                 { Composts.\r\n\r\nCommercial       { Materials furnishing nitrogen,\r\n  fertilizers    {     \"         \"      phosphoric acid,\r\n  or artificial  {     \"         \"      potash,\r\n  manures.       {     \"         \"      lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF FARM MANURES\r\n\r\nOf these two classes of manures the farmer should rely chiefly on the\r\nfarm manures letting the commercial fertilizers take a secondary place\r\nbecause:\r\n\r\nFarm manures are complete manures; that is they contain all the\r\nnecessary elements of plant food.\r\n\r\nFarm manures add to the soil large amounts of organic matter or humus.\r\n\r\nThe decay of organic matter produces carbonic acid which hastens the\r\ndecay of mineral matter in the soil and so increases the amount of\r\navailable plant food.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter changes the texture of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt makes sandy soils more compact and therefore more powerful to hold\r\nwater and plant food.\r\n\r\nIt makes heavy clay soils more open and porous, giving them greater\r\npower to absorb moisture and plant food. This admits also of better\r\ncirculation of the air in the soil, and prevents baking in dry\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nFarm manures influence all of the conditions necessary for root growth\r\nwhile the commercial fertilizers influence mainly the plant food\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe farm manures are good for all soils and crops.\r\n\r\nThey are lasting in their effects on the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN OR STABLE MANURE\r\n\r\nBarn or stable manure consists of the solid and liquid excrement of\r\nany of the farm animals mixed with the straw or other materials used\r\nas bedding for the comfort of the animals and to absorb the liquid\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe liquid parts should be saved, as they contain more than half of\r\nthe nitrogen and potash in the manure.\r\n\r\nThe value of barn manure for improving the soil conditions necessary\r\nfor root growth depends in a measure upon the plant food in it, but\r\nchiefly upon the very large proportion of organic matter which it\r\ncontains when it is applied to the soil.\r\n\r\nThese factors are influenced somewhat: by the kind of animal that\r\nproduces the manure; by the kind of food the animal receives; by the\r\nkind and amount of litter or bedding used; but they depend\r\nparticularly on the way the manure is cared for after it is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF VALUE\r\n\r\nImproper care of the manure may cause it to diminish in value very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n_Loss by leaching._\r\n\r\nIf the manure is piled against the side of the stable where water from\r\nthe roof can drip on it, as is often the case, or if it is piled in an\r\nexposed place where heavy rain can beat on it, the rain water in\r\nleaching through the manure washes out of it nitrogen and potash,\r\nwhich pass off in the dark brown liquid that oozes from the base of\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\n_Loss by heating or fermenting._\r\n\r\nWhen barn manure is thrown into piles it soon heats and throws off\r\nmore or less steam and gas. This heating of the manure is caused by\r\nfermentation or the breaking down of the materials composing the\r\nmanure and the forming of new compounds. This fermentation is produced\r\nby very small or microscopic plants called bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation of the manure is influenced by the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nA certain amount of heat is necessary to start the work of the\r\nbacteria. After they have once started they keep up and increase the\r\ntemperature of the pile until it gets so hot that sometimes a part of\r\nthe manure is reduced to ashes. The higher the temperature the more\r\nrapid the fermentation. This can be seen particularly in piles of\r\nhorse manure.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria which produce the most rapid fermentation in manure need\r\nplenty of air with its oxygen. Therefore fermentation will be more or\r\nless rapid according as the manure is piled loosely or in a close\r\ncompact mass.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of moisture is necessary for the fermentation to take\r\nplace, but if the manure is made quite wet the temperature is lowered\r\nand the fermentation is checked. The water also checks the\r\nfermentation by limiting the supply of air that can enter the pile.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the manure influences the fermentation. The\r\npresence of considerable amounts of soluble nitrogen hastens the\r\nrapidity of the fermentation.\r\n\r\nNow when the manure ferments a large part of the organic matter in it\r\nis broken down and changed into gases. The gas formed most abundantly\r\nby the fermentation is carbonic acid gas, which is produced by the\r\nunion of oxygen with carbon of the organic matter. The formation of\r\nthis gas means a loss of humus. This loss can be noticed by the fact\r\nthat the pile gradually becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe next most abundant product of the fermentation is water vapor\r\nwhich can often be seen passing off in clouds of steam.\r\n\r\nWhen manure ferments rapidly the nitrogen in it is changed largely\r\ninto ammonia. This ammonia combines with part of the carbonic acid gas\r\nand forms carbonate of ammonia, a very volatile salt which rapidly\r\nchanges to a vapor and is lost in the atmosphere. This causes a great\r\nloss of nitrogen during the rapid decomposition of the manure. This\r\nloss can be detected by the well known odor of the ammonia which is\r\nparticularly noticeable about horse stables and piles of horse manure.\r\n\r\nBesides these gases a number of compounds of nitrogen, potash, etc.,\r\nare formed which are soluble in water. It is these that form the dark\r\nbrown liquid that sometimes oozes out from the base of the manure\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nAt the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, the\r\nfollowing experiment was carried out to find out how much loss would\r\ntake place from a pile of manure:\r\n\r\n\"Four thousand pounds of manure from the horse stable were placed out\r\nof doors in a compact pile and left exposed from April 25th to\r\nSeptember 22d. The results were as follows:\"\r\n\r\n----------------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\n                            | April 25.   | Sept. 22.    |  Loss\r\n                            |             |              | per cent.\r\n----------------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\nGross weight                | 4,000  lbs. | 1,730   lbs. |   57\r\nNitrogen                    |   19.6  \"   |     7.79 \"   |   60\r\nPhos. acid                  |   14.8  \"   |     7.79 \"   |   47\r\nPotash                      |   36    \"   |     8.65 \"   |   76\r\nValue of plant food per ton |   $2.30     |    $1.06     |\r\n----------------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\n\r\nThis shows a loss of more than half the bulk of the manure and more\r\nthan half the plant food contained in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHECKING THE LOSSES\r\n\r\nThe first step to be taken in preserving the manure or in checking\r\nlosses is to provide sufficient bedding or litter in the stable to\r\nabsorb and save all the liquid parts.\r\n\r\nThe losses from fermentation of hot manures like horse manure may be\r\nlargely checked by mixing with the colder manure from the cow stable.\r\n\r\nLosses from fermentation may also be checked.\r\n\r\nBy piling compactly, which keeps the air out.\r\n\r\nBy moistening the pile, which lowers the temperature and checks the\r\naccess of oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe manure may be hauled directly to the field each day and spread on\r\nthe surface or plowed in. This method is the best when practicable\r\nbecause fermentation of the manure will take place slowly in the soil\r\nand the gases produced will be absorbed and retained by the soil.\r\n\r\nGypsum or land plaster is often sprinkled on stable floors and about\r\nmanure heaps to prevent the loss of ammonia.\r\n\r\nCopperas or blue stone, kainite and superphosphate are sometimes used\r\nfor the same purpose. There is, however, nothing better nor so good\r\nfor this purpose as dry earth containing a large percentage of humus.\r\n\r\nLosses from washing or leaching by rain may be prevented by piling the\r\nmanure under cover or by hauling it to the field as soon as produced\r\nand spreading it on the surface or plowing it under.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLYING THE MANURE TO THE SOIL\r\n\r\nFrom ten to twenty tons per acre is considered a sufficient\r\napplication of barn manure for most farm crops. Larger amounts are\r\nsometimes applied to the soil for truck and market garden crops.\r\n\r\nBarn manures are applied to the soil by these methods:\r\n\r\nThe manure is sometimes hauled out from the barn and placed in a large\r\npile in the field or in many small piles where it remains for some\r\ntime before being spread and plowed or harrowed in.\r\n\r\nSome farmers spread it on the field and allow it to lie some time\r\nbefore plowing it in.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes spread as soon as hauled to the field and is\r\nimmediately plowed in or mixed with the soil. This last is the safest\r\nand most economical method so far as the manure alone is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen the manure is left in a large pile it suffers losses due to\r\nfermentation and leaching.\r\n\r\nAt the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, five tons\r\nof manure from the cow stable, including three hundred pounds of\r\ngypsum which was mixed with it, were exposed in a compact pile out of\r\ndoors from April 25th to September 22d. The result was as follows:\r\n\r\n----------------------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n                            | April 25    | Sept 22     |   Loss\r\n                            |             |             | per cent.\r\n----------------------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\nGross weight                | 10,000 lbs. |  5,125 lbs. |     49\r\nNitrogen                    |     47  \"   |     28  \"   |     41\r\nPhos. acid                  |     32  \"   |     26  \"   |     19\r\nPotash                      |     48  \"   |     44  \"   |      8\r\nValue of plant food per ton |     $2.29   |     $1.60   |\r\n----------------------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n\r\nWhen distributed over the field in small piles and allowed to remain\r\nso for some time, losses from fermentation take place, and the rain\r\nwashes plant food from the pile into the soil under and immediately\r\nabout it. This results in an uneven distribution of plant food over\r\nthe field, for when the manure is finally scattered and plowed in,\r\npart of the field is fertilized with washed out manure while the soil\r\nunder and immediately about the location of the various piles is\r\noften so strongly fertilized that nothing can grow there unless it be\r\nrank, coarse weeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--A CROP OF COWPEAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--RED CLOVER.]\r\nWhen the manure is spread on the surface and allowed to lie for some\r\ntime it is apt to become dry and hard, and when finally plowed in,\r\ndecays very slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen the manure is plowed in or mixed with the soil as soon as applied\r\nto the field there results an even distribution of plant food in the\r\nsoil, fermentation takes place gradually and all gases formed are\r\nabsorbed by the soil, there is very little loss of valuable nitrogen\r\nand organic matter, and the fermentation taking place in the soil also\r\naids in breaking down the mineral constituents of the soil and making\r\navailable the plant food held by them.\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems best to spread the manure and plow it in or mix it\r\nwith the soil as soon as it is hauled to the field, when not prevented\r\nby bad weather and other more pressing work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER CONDITION OF MANURE WHEN APPLIED\r\n\r\nA large part of the value of barn manure lies in the fact that it\r\nconsists largely of organic matter, and therefore has an important\r\ninfluence on soil texture, and during its decay in the soil produces\r\nfavorable chemical changes in the soil constituents. Therefore it will\r\nproduce its greatest effect on the soil when applied fresh. For this\r\nreason it is generally best to haul the manure to the field and mix\r\nit with the soil as soon after it is produced as possible.\r\n\r\nIf coarse manures are mixed with light, sandy soils it is best to\r\nfollow with the roller, otherwise the coarse manure may cause the soil\r\nto lie so loose and open that both soil and manure will lose moisture\r\nso rapidly that fermentation of the manure will be stopped and the\r\nsoil will be unfit for planting.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to apply manure directly to delicate rooted truck and\r\nvegetable crops it is best to let it stand for some time until the\r\nfirst rank fermentation has taken place and the manure has become\r\nrotten.\r\n\r\nA good practice is to apply the manure in its fresh condition to\r\ncoarse feeding crops like corn, and then follow the corn by a more\r\ndelicate rooted crop which requires the manure to be in a more\r\ndecomposed condition than is necessary for the corn. In this case the\r\ncorn is satisfied and the remaining manure is in proper condition for\r\nthe following crop when it is planted.\r\n\r\nAnother practice is to broadcast the coarse manure on grass land and\r\nthen when the hay is harvested the sod and remaining manure are plowed\r\nunder for the following crop.\r\n\r\nA study of root development in Chapter II. tells us that most of the\r\nmanure used for cultivated crops should be broadcasted and thoroughly\r\nmixed with the soil. A small amount may be placed in the drill or hill\r\nand thoroughly mixed with the soil for crops that are planted in rows\r\nor furrows in order to give the young plant a rapid start. For the\r\nvegetable garden and flower garden and lawns, it is best to apply only\r\nmanure that has been piled for some time and has been turned over\r\nseveral times so that it is well rotted and broken up.\r\n\r\nThere may not be a single farm where it will be possible to carry out\r\nto the letter these principles applying to the treatment and\r\napplication of barn manures.\r\n\r\nThis is because climate, crops and conditions vary in different parts\r\nof the country and on different farms. Therefore we should study\r\ncarefully our conditions and the principles and make our practice so\r\ncombine the two as to produce the best and most economical results\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf we can get manure out in the winter it will very much lessen the\r\nrush of spring work.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country on account of deep snows, heavy rainfall\r\nand hilly fields, it is not advisable to apply manure in the winter.\r\nThis will necessitate storing the manure.\r\n\r\nIf conditions are such that we can get the manure on to the land as\r\nsoon as it is made, it should be applied to land on which a crop is\r\ngrowing or land which is soon to be planted. If land is not intended\r\nfor an immediate crop, put a cover crop on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSTS\r\n\r\nComposts are collections of farm trash or rubbish, as leaves, potato\r\ntops, weeds, road and ditch scrapings, fish, slaughter-house refuse,\r\netc., mixed in piles with lime, barn manure, woods-earth, swamp muck,\r\npeat and soil.\r\n\r\nThe object of composting these materials is to hasten their decay and\r\nrender available the plant food in them.\r\n\r\nThere are certain disadvantages in composting, namely:\r\n\r\nExpense of handling and carting on account of bulk.\r\n\r\nLow composition.\r\n\r\nLoss of organic matter by fermentation.\r\n\r\nCompost heaps serve as homes for weed seeds, insects and plant\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all waste organic matter on the farm should be saved and\r\nmade use of as manure. These materials when not too coarse may be\r\nspread on the surface of the soil and plowed under; they should never\r\nbe burned unless too coarse and woody or foul with weed seeds, insects\r\nand disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--SOY BEANS IN YOUNG ORCHARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--A YOUNG ALFALFA PLANT JUST COMING INTO\r\nFLOWER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nFARM MANURES--CONCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN-CROP MANURES\r\n\r\nGreen-crop manures are crops grown and plowed under for the purpose of\r\nimproving the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe main object of turning these crops under is to furnish the soil\r\nwith humus. Any crop may be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBy growing any of the class of crops called Legumes we may add to the\r\nsoil not only humus but also nitrogen. Cowpeas, beans, clover, vetch\r\nand plants having foliage, flowers, seed pods and seeds like them are\r\ncalled Legumes.\r\n\r\nMost of the farm plants take their nitrogen from the soil. This\r\nnitrogen is taken in the form of nitric acid and nitrogen salts\r\ndissolved in soil water. The legumes, however, are able to use the\r\nfree nitrogen which forms four-fifths of the atmosphere. This they do\r\nnot of their own power but through the aid of very minute plants\r\ncalled bacteria or nitrogen-fixing germs. These germs are so small\r\nthat they cannot be seen without the use of a powerful microscope. It\r\nwould take ten thousand average sized bacteria placed side by side to\r\nmeasure one inch.\r\n\r\nThese little germs make their homes in the roots of the legumes,\r\ncausing the root to enlarge at certain points and form tubercles or\r\nnodules (Figs. 34 and 35).\r\n\r\nCarefully dig up a root of clover, cowpea, soy bean or other legume\r\nand wash the soil from it. You will find numbers of the little\r\ntubercles or nodules. On the clover they will be about the size of a\r\npin head or a little larger. On the soy bean they will be nearly as\r\nlarge as the beans. These nodules are filled with colonies or families\r\nof bacteria which take the free nitrogen from the air which penetrates\r\nthe soil and give it over to the plant in return for house rent and\r\nstarch or other food they may have taken from the plant.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment at Cornell University Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, in 1896, clover seeds were sown August 1st, and the plants\r\nwere dug November 4th, three months and four days after the seeds were\r\nsown. The clovers were then weighed and tested and the following\r\nresults were obtained:\r\n\r\n----------------+----------------------------------------------\r\n                |        NITROGEN IN AN ACRE OF CLOVERS.\r\n                +---------------+----------------+-------------\r\n                | Lbs. in tops. | Lbs. in roots. | Lbs., total.\r\n----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------\r\nCrimson Clover  |    125.28     |     30.66      |   155.94\r\nMammoth Clover  |     67.57     |     78.39      |   145.96\r\nRed Clover      |     63.11     |     40.25      |   103.36\r\n----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------\r\n\r\nA large part of the nitrogen found in these plants was undoubtedly\r\ntaken by the roots from the soil air.\r\n\r\nBesides adding humus and nitrogen to the soil the legumes, being\r\nmostly deep-rooted plants, are able to take from the subsoil food\r\nwhich is out of reach of other plants. This food is distributed\r\nthroughout the plant and when the plant is plowed under the food is\r\ndeposited in the upper soil for the use of shallow-rooted plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe benefits derived from green crop manuring then are as follows:\r\n\r\nWe add to the soil organic matter or humus which is so helpful in\r\nbringing about the conditions necessary for root growth.\r\n\r\nBy using the legumes for our green manure crops we may supply the soil\r\nwith nitrogen taken from the air.\r\n\r\nWe return to the surface soil not only the plant food taken from it\r\nbut also plant food brought from the subsoil by the roots of the green\r\nmanure plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF BEST PLANTS FOR GREEN CROP MANURING\r\n\r\nThe plants best adapted to green crop manuring are deep-rooted,\r\nheavy-foliaged plants. Of these the legumes are by far the best, as\r\nthey collect the free nitrogen from the air which other plants cannot\r\ndo. This enables the farmer to grow nitrogen which is very expensive\r\nto buy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIME FOR GROWING GREEN MANURE CROPS\r\n\r\nGreen manure crops may be grown at any time that the soil is not\r\noccupied by other crops, provided other conditions are suitable. Land\r\nwhich is used for spring and summer crops often lies bare and idle\r\nduring fall and winter. A hardy green manure crop planted after the\r\nsummer crop is harvested will make considerable growth during the fall\r\nand early spring, and this can be plowed under for the use of the\r\nfollowing summer crops. If there is a long interval of time during\r\nspring or summer when the land is bare, that is a good time for a\r\ngreen manure crop.\r\n\r\nGreen manure crops are often planted between the rows of other crops\r\nsuch as corn or cotton at the last working of the crop for the benefit\r\nof the crop which is to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to arrange for a green manure crop at least once in\r\nthree or four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOUS GREEN MANURE CROPS\r\n\r\n_Cowpea_. (Field pea, stock pea, black pea, black-eyed pea, clay pea,\r\netc.) (Fig. 79.)\r\n\r\nThe cowpea is perhaps the most important leguminous plant grown for\r\nsoil improvement in the South. It will grow anywhere south of the\r\nOhio River and can be grown with fair success in many localities\r\nfarther north.\r\n\r\nIt is a tender annual, that is, it is killed by frost and makes its\r\nentire growth from seed to seed in a single season. It should\r\ntherefore be planted only during the spring and summer. This crop not\r\nonly has power like the other legumes to take nitrogen from the air,\r\nbut it is also a strong feeder, that is, it can feed upon mineral\r\nplant food in the soil that other plants are unable to make use of.\r\nFor this reason it will grow on some of the poorest soils, and is a\r\ngood plant with which to begin the improvement of very poor land. It\r\nis a deep-rooted plant. On the farm of the Hampton Normal and\r\nAgricultural Institute cowpea roots have been traced to the depth of\r\nsixty-one inches.\r\n\r\nCowpeas will grow on almost any land that is not too wet. From one and\r\none-half to three bushels of seed are used per acre. These are sown\r\nbroadcast and harrowed in or are planted in drills or furrows and\r\ncultivated a few times. Aside from its value as a green manure crop\r\nthe cowpea is useful as food for man and the farm animals. The green\r\npods are used as string beans or snaps. The ripened seeds are used as\r\na food and the vines make good fodder for the farm animals.\r\n\r\n\"Experiments at the Louisiana Experiment Station show that one acre of\r\ncowpeas yielding 3,970.38 pounds of organic matter, turned under, gave\r\nto the soil 64.95 pounds of nitrogen, 20.39 pounds of phosphoric acid\r\nand 110.56 pounds of potash.\"--Farmer's Bulletin, 16 U.S. Dept. of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n\"It is now grown in all the States south of the Ohio River, and in\r\n1899 there were planted nearly 800,000 acres to the crop. Basing our\r\nestimate on the amount of nitrogen stored in the soil by this crop, it\r\nis fair to say that fully fifteen million pounds of this valuable\r\nsubstance were collected and retained as a result of the planting of\r\nthe cowpea alone. This at fifteen cents per pound (the market price of\r\nnitrogen) would be worth something more than $2,000,000 for nitrogen\r\nalone.\"--Year Book of the Department of Agriculture, 1902.\r\n\r\n_The Clovers._--These are the most extensively grown plants for green\r\nmanure purposes in the United States. They are deep-rooted, and are\r\nable to use mineral food that is too tough for other plants. They\r\nfurnish large crops of hay or green forage and a good aftermath and\r\nsod to turn under as green manure, or the entire crop may be plowed\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n_Red Clover_ is the most widely planted (Fig. 80). It is a perennial\r\nplant and grows from the most northern States to the northern border\r\nof the Gulf States. It grows best on the loams and heavier soils well\r\nsupplied with water, but not wet. It is sown broadcast at the rate of\r\nfrom ten to twenty pounds of seed per acre. In the North it is\r\ngenerally sown in the spring on fields of winter grain. In the South,\r\nSeptember and October are recommended as the proper sowing times. It\r\nis the custom to let it grow two years, cutting it for hay and seed,\r\nand then to turn the aftermath and sod under.\r\n\r\n_Mammoth Red Clover_, also called sapling clover and pea-vine clover,\r\nclosely resembles the red clover, but is ranker in growth and matures\r\ntwo or three weeks later. It is better adapted to wet land than the\r\nred clover.\r\n\r\n_Crimson Clover_, also called German clover and Italian clover, is a\r\nvaluable green manure crop in the central and southern States east of\r\nthe Mississippi. It is a hardy annual in that section and is generally\r\nsown from the last of July to the middle of October, either by itself\r\nor with cultivated crops at their last working. Fifteen and twenty\r\npounds of seed are used to the acre. It makes a good growth during the\r\nfall and early winter and is in blossom and ready to cut or plow under\r\nin April or May. It grows at a season when the cowpea will not live.\r\nCrimson clover will grow on soils too light for other clovers.\r\n\r\nThe _Soy Bean_, also called soja bean and Japanese pea, is another\r\nleguminous crop used for green manuring (Fig. 81). It was introduced\r\ninto this country from Japan and in some localities is quite\r\nextensively planted. It grows more upright than the cowpea and\r\nproduces a large amount of stem and foliage which may be used for\r\nfodder or turned under for green manure The seeds are used for food\r\nfor man and beast. The soy bean is planted and cared for in the same\r\nmanner as the cowpea.\r\n\r\nThe _Canadian Field Pea_ is sometimes grown in the north as a green\r\nmanure crop.\r\n\r\n_White Sweet Clover_, white melitot or Bokhara clover, grows as a weed\r\nfrom New England to the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf States it is\r\nregarded as a valuable forage and green manure plant. One or two pecks\r\nof seed per acre are sown in January or February.\r\n\r\n_Alfalfa_, or lucern, though grown more for a forage crop than for\r\ngreen manuring, should be mentioned here, for wherever grown and for\r\nwhatever purpose, its effects on the soil are beneficial (Fig. 82).\r\nThis plant requires a well prepared soil that is free from weeds.\r\nTwenty to twenty-five pounds of seed are planted per acre. In the\r\nnorth the seeding is generally done in the spring after danger of\r\nfrost is past, as frost kills the young plants. In the South fall\r\nseeding is the custom in order to give the young plants a long start\r\nahead of the spring weeds. One seeding if well cared for lasts for\r\nmany years. Alfalfa is pastured or cut for hay, four to eight tons\r\nbeing the yield. Many fields run out in five or six years and the sod\r\nis plowed under. This plant sends its roots thirteen, sixteen, and\r\neven thirty feet into the soil after water and food, and when these\r\nroots decay they furnish the lower soil with organic matter and their\r\npassages serve as drains and ventilators in the soil. Alfalfa is grown\r\nextensively in the semi-arid regions of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-LEGUMINOUS GREEN MANURE PLANTS\r\n\r\nAmong the non-leguminous green manure plants are rye, wheat, oats,\r\nmustard, rape, buckwheat. Of these the rye and buckwheat are most\r\ngenerally used, the rye being a winter crop and the other a warm\r\nweather plant. They are both strong feeders and can use tough plant\r\nfood. They do not add new nitrogen to the soil though they furnish\r\nhumus and prepare food for the weaker feeders which may follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAW MATERIALS\r\n\r\nNext to the soil itself, the farmer's most important sources of plant\r\nfood are the farm manures. But most farms do not produce these in\r\nsufficient quantities to keep up the plant food side of fertility.\r\nTherefore the farmer must resort to other sources of plant food to\r\nsupplement the farm manures.\r\n\r\nThere is a large class of materials called Commercial Fertilizers,\r\nwhich, if judiciously used, will aid in maintaining the fertility of\r\nthe farm with economy.\r\n\r\nWe learned in a previous chapter that the plant foods, nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, potash and lime, are apt to be found wanting in\r\nsufficient available quantities to supply the needs of profitable\r\ncrops. We learned also that lime is useful in improving the texture of\r\nthe soil and in making other plant foods available. Now the commercial\r\nfertilizers are used to supply the soil with these four substances and\r\nthey may be classified according to the substance furnished as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Sources of nitrogen,\r\n     \"    \"  phosphoric acid,\r\n     \"    \"  potash,\r\n     \"    \"  lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF NITROGEN\r\n\r\nNitrogen is the most expensive of plant foods to buy, therefore\r\nspecial attention should be given to producing it on the farm by means\r\nof barn manures and legumes plowed under.\r\n\r\nThe principal commercial sources of nitrogen are: Nitrate of soda,\r\nsulphate of ammonia, dried blood, tankage, dry ground fish,\r\ncotton-seed meal.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Soda_ or Chile saltpetre containing 15.5 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen, is found in large deposits in the rainless regions of\r\nwestern South America. In the crude state as it comes from the mine it\r\ncontains common salt and earthy matter as impurities. To remove these\r\nimpurities the crude nitrate is put into tanks of warm water. The\r\nnitrate dissolves and the salt and earthy matter settle to the bottom\r\nof the tank. The water with the nitrate in solution is then drawn off\r\ninto other tanks from which the water is evaporated, leaving the\r\nnitrate, a coarse, dirty looking salt which is packed in\r\nthree-hundred-pound bags and shipped.\r\n\r\nPlants that take their nitrogen from the soil take it in the form of\r\nnitrate. Hence nitrate of soda, which is very soluble in water, is\r\nimmediately available to plants and is one of the most directly\r\nuseful nitrogen fertilizers. It is used for quick results and should\r\nbe applied only to land that has a crop or is to be immediately\r\nplanted, otherwise it is liable to be lost by leaching.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Ammonia_ contains 20 per cent. of nitrogen. It is a white\r\nsalt, finer and cleaner looking than the nitrate. It is a by-product\r\nof the gas works and coke ovens. The nitrogen in it is quite readily\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n_Dried Blood_ contains 8 to 12 per cent. of nitrogen. This is blood\r\ncollected in slaughter-houses and dried by steam or hot air. It decays\r\nrapidly in the soil and is a quick acting nitrogen fertilizer.\r\n\r\n_Tankage_ contains 4 to 8 per cent. of nitrogen and 7 to 20 per cent.\r\nof phosphoric acid. Slaughter-house waste, such as meat and bone\r\nscrap, are boiled or steamed to extract the fat. The settlings are\r\ndried and ground and sold as tankage. It is much slower in its action\r\nthan dried blood and supplies the crop with both nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n_Dried Fish Scrap_ is a by-product of the fish oil factories and the\r\nfish canning factories. It contains 7 to 9 per cent. of nitrogen and 6\r\nto 8 per cent. of phosphoric acid. It undergoes nitrification readily\r\nand is a quick acting organic source of nitrogen and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n_Cotton-seed Meal_ contains 7 per cent. of nitrogen, about 2.5\r\nphosphoric acid, and 1.5 per cent. of potash. It is a product of the\r\ncotton oil factories and is obtained by grinding the cotton seed cake\r\nfrom which the oil has been pressed. It is a most valuable source of\r\nnitrogen for the South.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen in the dried blood, tankage, fish scrap and cotton-seed\r\nmeal, being organic nitrogen, must be changed by the process of\r\nnitrification to nitric acid or nitrate before it is available. They\r\nare therefore better materials to use for a more gradual and\r\ncontinuous feeding of crops than the nitrate of soda or sulphate of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nScrap leather, wool waste, horn and hoof shavings are rich in nitrogen\r\nbut they decay so slowly that they make poor fertilizers. They are\r\nused by fertilizer manufacturers in making cheap mixed fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF PHOSPHORIC ACID\r\n\r\nThe principal commercial sources of phosphoric acid are:\r\n\r\n  Phosphate Rocks.\r\n  Bones.\r\n  Fish scrap.\r\n  Phosphate slag.\r\n\r\nThe _Phosphate Rocks_ are found in shallow mines in North and South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Florida and Tennessee, and also as pebbles in the\r\nriver beds. They are the fossil remains of animals. After being dug\r\nfrom the mines the rock is kiln dried and then ground to a very fine\r\npowder called \"floats\" which is used on the soil. The phosphoric acid\r\nin the floats is insoluble and becomes available only as the phosphate\r\ndecays. This is too slow for most plants so it is treated with oil of\r\nvitriol or sulphuric acid to make it available. The phosphoric acid in\r\nthe ground rock is combined with lime, forming a phosphate of lime\r\nwhich is insoluble. When treated with the oil of vitriol or sulphuric\r\nacid, the sulphuric acid takes lime from the phosphate and forms\r\nsulphate of lime or gypsum. The phosphoric acid is left combined with\r\nthe smallest possible amount of lime and is soluble in water. It is\r\nthen called soluble or water soluble phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nNow if this soluble form remains unused it begins to take on lime\r\nagain and turns back toward its original insoluble form. After a time\r\nit gets to such a state that it is no longer soluble in water but is\r\nsoluble in weak acids. It is then said to be reverted phosphoric acid.\r\nReverted phosphoric acid is also called citrate soluble phosphoric\r\nacid, because in testing fertilizers the chemists use ammonium citrate\r\nto determine the amount of reverted phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThis form still continues to take on lime and by and by gets back to\r\nthe original insoluble form called insoluble phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe soluble phosphoric acid and reverted phosphoric acid are available\r\nto plant roots. The insoluble form is not.\r\n\r\nThe rock phosphates contain from 26 to 35 per cent. of insoluble\r\nphosphoric acid. The acid phosphates or dissolved rock phosphates\r\ncontain from 12 to 16 per cent. of available phosphoric acid and from\r\n1 to 4 per cent. of insoluble.\r\n\r\n_Bone Fertilizers._ Bones have long been a valuable and favored source\r\nof phosphoric acid. In addition to phosphoric acid they contain some\r\nnitrogen which adds to their value. They are organic phosphates and\r\nare quite lasting in their effect on the soil as they decay slowly.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"Raw Bone,\" \"Steamed Bone,\" \"Ground Bone,\" \"Bone Meal,\"\r\n\"Bone Dust,\" \"Bone Black,\" \"Dissolved Bone,\" indicate the processes\r\nthrough which the bone has passed in preparation, or the condition of\r\nthe material as put on the market and used on the soil.\r\n\r\nGround bone, bone meal, bone dust, indicate the mechanical conditions\r\nof the bones.\r\n\r\nThe bones are sometimes ground \"raw\" just as they come from the\r\nslaughter-house or kitchen, or they are sometimes first \"steamed\" to\r\nextract the fat for soap, and the nitrogenous matter for glue.\r\n\r\n_Raw Bone._ Analysis: Nitrogen, 2.5 to 4.5 per cent. Available\r\nphosphoric acid, 5 to 8 per cent. Insoluble phosphoric acid 15 to 17\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n_Steamed Bone_ contains 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. of nitrogen, 6 to 9 per\r\ncent. of available phosphoric acid and 16 to 20 per cent. of insoluble\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nSteamed bone pulverizes much finer than raw bone and decays more\r\nrapidly in the soil because the fat has been extracted from it.\r\n\r\n_Dissolved Bone._ Ground bone is sometimes treated with sulphuric acid\r\nto render the phosphoric acid in it more available. It is then called\r\ndissolved bone and contains thirteen to fifteen per cent. of\r\navailable phosphoric acid and two to three per cent. of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Dissolved Bone Black._ Bone charcoal is used for refining sugar. It\r\nis then turned over to the fertilizer manufacturers who sell it as\r\n\"Bone Black\" or treat it with sulphuric acid and then put it on the\r\nmarket as dissolved bone black.\r\n\r\nThe bone black contains thirty to thirty-six per cent. of insoluble\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe dissolved bone black contains 15 to 17 per cent. of available\r\nphosphoric acid and 1 to 2 per cent. insoluble.\r\n\r\n\"_Thomas Slag_,\" \"_Phosphate Slag_,\" \"_Odorless Phosphate_.\"\r\nPhosphorous is an impurity in certain iron ores. In the manufacture of\r\nBessemer steel this is extracted by the use of lime which melts in the\r\nfurnace, unites with the phosphorous and brings it away in the slag.\r\nThis slag is ground to a fine powder and used as a fertilizer. It\r\ncontains 11 to 23 per cent. of phosphoric acid, most of which is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n_Superphosphate._ The term superphosphate is applied to the phosphates\r\nthat have been treated with sulphuric acid to make the phosphoric acid\r\navailable. Dissolved bone, dissolved bone black, and the dissolved\r\nphosphate rocks are superphosphates.\r\n\r\n_Fish Scrap_, mentioned as a source of nitrogen, is also a valuable\r\nsource of phosphoric acid, containing 6 to 8 per cent., which is quite\r\nreadily available owing to the rapid decay of the scrap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF POTASH\r\n\r\nThe chief sources of potash used for fertilizers are the potash salts\r\nfrom the potash mines at Stassfurt, Germany, where there is an immense\r\ndeposit of rock salt and potash salts.\r\n\r\nThe principal products of these mines used in this country are the\r\ncrude salts:\r\n\r\n_Kainite_, containing 12 per cent. of potash.\r\n\r\n_Sylvinite_, containing 16 to 20 per cent. of potash, and the higher\r\ngrade salts manufactured from the crude salts:\r\n\r\n_Muriate of Potash_, containing 50 per cent. potash.\r\n\r\n_High grade Sulphate of Potash_, containing 50 per cent. potash.\r\n\r\n_Low grade Sulphate of Potash_, containing 25 per cent. potash.\r\n\r\n_Wood Ashes_, if well kept and not allowed to get wet and leach,\r\ncontain 4 to 9 per cent. of potash.\r\n\r\n_Cotton Hull Ashes_ contain 20 to 30 per cent, of potash and 7 to 9\r\nper cent. of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe potash in all these forms is soluble in water and equally\r\navailable to plants. The crude salts, kainite and sylvinite, and the\r\nmuriate contain chlorine and are not considered good for potatoes and\r\ntobacco as the chlorine lowers the quality of these products.\r\n\r\nIn tobacco regions tobacco refuse is a valuable source of potash, the\r\nstems are about five per cent. potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME\r\n\r\n_Lime_ is generally supplied to the soil in the form of quicklime made\r\nby burning lime stone or shells. Other forms are gypsum or land\r\nplaster, gas lime (a refuse from gas works) and marl. Most soils\r\ncontain sufficient lime for the food requirements of most plants. Some\r\nsoils, however, are deficient in lime and some crops, particularly the\r\nlegumes, are benefitted by direct feeding with lime.\r\n\r\nLime is valuable for its effect on the soil properties which\r\nconstitute fertility.\r\n\r\nPhysically lime acts on the texture of the soil making clay soils\r\nmealy and crumbly, and causing the lighter soils to adhere or stick\r\ntogether more closely.\r\n\r\nChemically, lime decomposes minerals containing potash and other plant\r\nfoods, thus rendering them available for the use of plants. It also\r\naids the decay of organic matter and sweetens sour soils.\r\n\r\nBiologically lime aids the process of nitrification.\r\n\r\nThe action of lime is greatest in its caustic or unslacked form.\r\n\r\nToo much or too frequent liming may injure the soil. It should be\r\ncarefully tried in a small way, and its action noted, before using it\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\nA common way of using lime is to place twenty to forty bushels on an\r\nacre in heaps of three to five bushels, covering them with soil until\r\nthe lime slacks to a fine powder. The lime is then spread and harrowed\r\nin. Lime tends to hasten the decay of humus. It should not be applied\r\noftener than once in four or five years.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum_, a sulphate of lime, is similar to lime in its action on the\r\nsoil. Its most important effect is the setting free of potash from its\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n_Gas lime_ should be used with great care as it contains substances\r\nthat are poisonous to plant roots. It is best to let it lie exposed to\r\nthe weather several months before using.\r\n\r\n_Marl_ is simply soil containing an amount of lime varying from five\r\nto fifty per cent. It has value in the vicinity of marl beds but does\r\nnot pay to haul very far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS--CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXED FERTILIZERS\r\n\r\n_What they are._\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of business concerns in the country which buy\r\nthe raw materials described in Chapter XXI, mix them in various\r\nproportions, and sell the product as mixed or manufactured\r\nfertilizers. If these mixtures contain the three important plant\r\nfoods, nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, they are sometimes called\r\n\"complete\" manures or fertilizers. In some parts of the country all\r\ncommercial fertilizers are called \"guano.\"\r\n\r\n_Many brands._\r\n\r\nThese raw materials are mixed in many different proportions and many\r\ndealers have special brands for special crops. There are consequently\r\nlarge numbers of brands of fertilizers which vary in the amounts,\r\nproportions and availability of the plant foods they contain. For\r\ninstance, in 1903, twenty-three fertilizer manufacturers offered for\r\nsale ninety-six different brands in the State of Rhode Island. In\r\nMissouri one hundred and ten brands, made by sixteen different\r\nmanufacturers, were offered for sale. Eighty-three manufacturers\r\nplaced six hundred and forty-four brands on the market in New York\r\nState during the same year. Of one hundred and twenty brands\r\nregistered for sale in Vermont in the spring of 1904, there were\r\nseventeen mixtures for corn and thirty-four for potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is more or less confusion on the part of the farmer\r\nin purchasing fertilizers, and with many a farmer it is a lottery as\r\nto whether or not he is buying what his crop or his soil needs.\r\n\r\nSome of the manufacturers are not above using poor, low grade, raw\r\nmaterials in making these mixtures.\r\n\r\nThis means that the farmer should make himself familiar with the\r\nsubject of fertilizers if he desires to use them intelligently and\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\n_Safeguard for the farmer._\r\n\r\nAs a safeguard to the buyer of fertilizers the State laws require that\r\nevery brand put on the market shall be registered and that every bag\r\nor package sold shall have stated on it an analysis showing the\r\namounts of nitrogen, or its equivalent in ammonia, the soluble\r\nphosphoric acid, the reverted phosphoric acid, the insoluble\r\nphosphoric acid, and the potash.\r\n\r\nThis registration is generally made at the State experiment station,\r\nand the director of the station is instructed to take samples of these\r\nbrands and have them analyzed, and publish the results together with\r\nthe analysis guaranteed by the maker.\r\n\r\nThese analyses are published in bulletin form and should be in the\r\nhands of every farmer who makes a practice of using commercial\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of fertilizers comply with the law by printing on\r\nthe bag or package the per cents of plant food in the fertilizers, and\r\nthese statements in the great majority of cases agree favorably with\r\nthe analyses of the experiment stations, but they do not in all cases\r\nstate what materials were used to furnish the different kinds of plant\r\nfood, and it is not always possible to find this out by analysis.\r\n\r\n_Low grade materials._\r\n\r\nFor instance in mixing a fertilizer one manufacturer may use dried\r\nblood to furnish nitrogen and another may use leather waste or horn\r\nshavings. The latter contains more nitrogen than the dried blood, but\r\nthey are so tough and decay so slowly that they are of little benefit\r\nto a quick growing plant.\r\n\r\n_Inflating the guarantee._\r\n\r\nAlthough the dealer states correctly the per cents of plant food in\r\nthe fertilizer, he is quite frequently inclined to repeat this in a\r\ndifferent form, and thus give the impression that the mixture contains\r\nmore than it really does.\r\n\r\nThe dealers also give the nitrogen as ammonia because it makes a\r\nlarger showing.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is often stated as \"bone phosphate\" because in this\r\nthe amount appears to be greater.\r\n\r\nFor example, an analysis taken from a fertilizer catalogue reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAmmonia                              2 to  3 per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid            8 to 10     \"\r\nTotal Phosphoric Acid               11 to 14     \"\r\nTotal Bone Phosphate                23 to 25     \"\r\nActual Potash                       10 to 12     \"\r\nSulphate of Potash                  18 to 20     \"\r\n\r\nA better statement would be as follows:\r\n\r\nNitrogen                                              1.65 per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid                             8       \"\r\nTotal Phosphoric Acid (furnished in Bone Phosphate)  11       \"\r\nPotash (furnished in Sulphate of Potash)             10       \"\r\n\r\nAmmonia is reduced to terms of nitrogen by multiplying by .824. All\r\nbone phosphate is forty-six per cent. phosphoric acid. When bone\r\nphosphate is given instead of phosphoric acid it simply makes the\r\nmixture appear to have more in it, and when both phosphoric acid and\r\nbone phosphate are stated one is merely a repetition of the other. The\r\nsame is true of the statements, potash and sulphate of potash, one is\r\na repetition of the other only a different form.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUATION\r\n\r\nThe experiment stations not only publish comparative analyses of the\r\nregistered fertilizers but they also compute the market values of the\r\nplant food contained in them and compare these valuations with the\r\nselling price of the fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThey also furnish a list of trade values of the plant foods in raw\r\nmaterials for the convenience of fertilizer buyers in testing the\r\nvalues of the brands offered them on the markets.\r\n\r\nIn the following list are given the \"trade values agreed upon by the\r\nExperiment Stations of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New\r\nJersey and Vermont, after a careful study of prices ruling in the\r\nlarger markets of the southern New England and Middle States.\"\r\n\r\nTrade values of fertilizing ingredients in raw materials and chemicals\r\nfor 1904:\r\n\r\n                                                      Cents per lb.\r\nNitrogen in Nitrates                                       16\r\nNitrogen in Ammonia Salts                                  17½\r\nOrganic Nitrogen in dry and fine ground fish, blood,\r\n  and meat, and in mixed fertilizers                       17½\r\nOrganic Nitrogen in fine ground bone and tankage           17\r\nOrganic Nitrogen in coarse bone and tankage                12½\r\nPhosphoric Acid soluble in water                            4½\r\nPhosphoric Acid soluble in ammonium citrate                 4\r\nPhosphoric Acid in fine ground bone and tankage             4\r\nPhosphoric Acid in coarse bone and tankage                  3\r\nPhosphoric Acid (insoluble in water and in ammonium\r\n  citrate) in mixed fertilizer                              2\r\nPotash as high-grade sulphate and in mixtures free\r\n  from muriate (chloride)                                   5\r\nPotash as muriate                                           4¼\r\n\r\nFor example, in calculating the commercial value of the plant food in\r\na fertilizer we will take the formula mentioned on page 205, namely:\r\n\r\nAmmonia                              2 to  3 per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid            8 to 10     \"\r\nTotal Phosphoric Acid               11 to 14     \"\r\nTotal Bone Phosphate                23 to 25     \"\r\nActual Potash                       10 to 12     \"\r\nSulphate of Potash                  18 to 20     \"\r\n\r\nThis fertilizer is evidently a mixture of bone meal and sulphate of\r\npotash and the plant food contained in it is as follows:\r\n\r\nNitrogen                                1.65 per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid               8        \"\r\nInsoluble Phosphoric Acid               3        \"\r\nPotash                                 10        \"\r\n\r\nOne hundred pounds of the mixture would contain:\r\n\r\n                             Pounds.

Add\r\nto this $8, which is about the average charge for mixing, bagging,\r\nshipping, selling and profit, and we find that $32 is probably the\r\nlowest figure at which this fertilizer could be purchased on the\r\nmarkets, and very likely the price would be higher as we have taken\r\nthe lowest guaranteed per cent. of plant food for our basis of\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nFertilizers are generally mixed and sold to the farmer on the ton\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOW GRADE MIXTURES\r\n\r\nMost dealers, to meet a certain demand, furnish mixtures ranging from\r\n$15 to $25 per ton. These mixtures are necessarily low grade and are\r\nmore expensive than the higher priced high grade mixtures.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nA certain potato fertilizer on the market, which we will call mixture\r\nA, has the following guaranteed analysis:\r\n\r\nAmmonia                            7 to 8 per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid          6 to 7     \"\r\nActual Potash                      5 to 6     \"\r\n\r\nA ton of this would contain:\r\n\r\n                           Pounds.\r\nNitrogen                   115.4 value at 17½¢      $20.19\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid  120     \"    \"  4¢         4.80\r\nPotash                     100     \"    \"  5¢         5.00\r\n                           -----                    ------\r\n  Totals                   335.4                    $29.99\r\n\r\nAdd to this the average charge for mixing, bagging, selling, profit,\r\netc., $8, and the cost will be $37.99.\r\n\r\nThe selling price of this fertilizer would probably be not less than\r\n$40. Now suppose the farmer thinks this a high priced and expensive\r\nfertilizer and looks about for something cheaper. He finds a low grade\r\npotato fertilizer, which we will call mixture B, that has the\r\nfollowing guarantee:\r\n\r\nAmmonia                      3½ to 4     per cent.\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid    3  to 3½        \"\r\nActual Potash                2½ to 3         \"\r\n\r\nJust one-half the guarantee of the high grade mixture A. A ton of this\r\ncontains:\r\n\r\n                           Pounds.\r\nNitrogen                    57.7 value at 17½¢      $10.10\r\nAvailable Phosphoric Acid   60     \"    \"  4¢         2.40\r\nPotash                      50     \"    \"  5¢         2.50\r\n                           -----                    ------\r\n  Totals                   167.7                    $15.00\r\n  Add average charge for mixing, etc.                 8.00\r\n                                                    ------\r\n                                                    $23.00\r\n\r\nThe selling price of this would very likely be not less than $25.\r\n\r\nThis seems at first sight to be cheaper and more reasonable. But let\r\nus see.\r\n\r\nIn a ton of mixture A he gets 335.4 pounds of plant food for $40, or\r\nat an average cost of twelve cents per pound, while in a ton of\r\nmixture B he gets 167.7 pounds of plant food for $25, or at an average\r\ncost of fifteen cents per pound.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, in a ton of the high grade mixture A, he gets\r\n335.4 pounds of plant food for $40. To get the same amount of plant\r\nfood, 335.4 pounds, in the low grade mixture, B, it will be necessary\r\nto buy two tons at a cost of $50.\r\n\r\nA low grade fertilizer is always expensive even if the plant food is\r\nfurnished by high grade materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUY ON THE PLANT FOOD BASIS\r\n\r\nThe farmer generally buys his fertilizer on the ton basis. A better\r\nmethod is to buy just as the fertilizer manufacturers buy the raw\r\nmaterials they use for mixing, namely, on the basis of actual plant\r\nfood in the fertilizer. The dealers have what they call the \"unit\r\nbasis,\" a \"unit\" meaning one per cent. of a ton or twenty pounds of\r\nplant food. A ton of nitrate of soda, for instance, contains 310\r\npounds or 15½ units of nitrogen, which at $3.20 cents per unit would\r\ncost $49. Buy your mixture of a reliable firm, find out the actual\r\namounts of the plant foods in the mixture and pay a fair market price\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS--CONCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOME MIXING OF FERTILIZERS\r\n\r\nWhen a considerable amount of fertilizer is used a better plan than\r\nbuying mixed fertilizer is to buy the raw materials and mix them\r\nyourself. For example, a farmer is about to plant five acres of\r\ncabbages for the market. He finds that a certain successful cabbage\r\ngrower recommends the use of fifty pounds nitrogen, fifty pounds\r\nphosphoric acid and seventy pounds potash per acre. For the five acres\r\nthis will mean 250 pounds nitrogen, 250 pounds phosphoric acid and 350\r\npounds potash. To furnish the nitrogen he can buy 1,613 pounds of\r\nnitrate of soda or 2,500 pounds dried blood or 1,250 pounds sulphate\r\nof ammonia, or a part of each. To furnish the phosphoric acid he can\r\nbuy 1,786 pounds acid phosphate. Seven hundred pounds of either\r\nsulphate or muriate of potash will furnish the potash. These materials\r\ncan be easily mixed by spreading in alternate layers on a smooth floor\r\nand then shovelling over the entire mass several times. The mixture\r\ncan be further improved by passing it through a sand or coal screen or\r\nsieve.\r\n\r\nBy following this method of buying the raw materials and mixing them\r\non the farm, the farmer can reduce his fertilizer bill by quite a\r\nconsiderable amount and at the same time can obtain just the kinds and\r\nproper amounts of plant foods needed by his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIND AND AMOUNT TO BUY\r\n\r\nThe farmer should make the best use of farm manures and through\r\ntillage to render plant food available for his crops before turning to\r\ncommercial fertilizer for additional plant food.\r\n\r\nIf he grows leguminous crops for green manuring, for feeding stock or\r\nfor cover crops, he can in many cases secure, chiefly through them,\r\nsufficient high priced nitrogen for the needs of his crops, and it is\r\nnecessary only occasionally to purchase moderate amounts of phosphoric\r\nacid, potash and lime.\r\n\r\nFor special farming and special crops it may be necessary to use the\r\ncommercial fertilizer more freely.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say here just what amounts or what kinds of\r\nfertilizer should be purchased, because no two farms are exactly alike\r\nas to soil, methods of cropping or methods of tillage.\r\n\r\nThere are certain factors, however, which will serve as a general\r\nguide and which should be considered in determining the kind and\r\namount of fertilizer to buy.\r\n\r\nThese factors are:\r\n\r\n  The crop.\r\n  The soil.\r\n  The system of farming.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROP\r\n\r\nCrop roots differ in their powers of feeding, or their powers of\r\nsecuring plant foods. Some roots can use very tough plant foods, while\r\nothers require it in the most available form. Some roots secure\r\nnitrogen from the air. The cowpea roots, for example, can take\r\nnitrogen from the air and they can use such tough phosphoric acid and\r\npotash that it seldom pays to feed them directly with fertilizers.\r\n\r\nA bale per acre crop of cotton requires for the building of roots,\r\nstems, leaves, bolls, lint and seed:\r\n\r\n  103 pounds of Nitrogen.\r\n   41   \"    \"  Phosphoric Acid.\r\n   65   \"    \"  Potash.\r\n\r\nand yet experiment and experience have proved that the best fertilizer\r\nfor such a crop contains the following amounts of plant food:\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen                            20 pounds\r\n  Phosphoric Acid                     70   \"\r\n  Potash                              20   \"\r\n\r\nThis means that cotton roots are fairly strong feeders of nitrogen and\r\npotash, but are weak on the phosphoric acid side.\r\n\r\nThe small grains, wheat, oats, barley and rye, can use tough\r\nphosphoric acid and potash, but are weak on nitrogen, and as they make\r\nthe greater part of their growth in the cool spring before\r\nnitrification is rapid, they are benefitted by the application of\r\nnitrogen, particularly in the form of nitrate, which is quickly\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nClover, peas, beans, etc., have the power of drawing nitrogen from the\r\nair, but draw from the soil lime, phosphoric acid and potash. Hence\r\nthe phosphates, potash manures and lime are desirable for these crops.\r\n\r\nRoot and tuber crops are unable to use the insoluble mineral elements\r\nin the soil, hence they require application of all the important plant\r\nfoods in readily available form. Nitrogen is especially beneficial to\r\nbeets. Turnips are benefitted by liberal applications of soluble\r\nphosphoric acid. White and sweet potatoes require an abundance of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nIf we are growing tender, succulent market garden crops, we need\r\nnitrogenous manures, which increase the growth of stem and foliage.\r\n\r\nFruit trees are slow growing plants and do not need quick acting\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe small fruits, being more rapid in growth, require more of the\r\nsoluble materials.\r\n\r\nA dark, healthy green foliage indicates a good supply of nitrogen,\r\nwhile a pale yellowish green may indicate a need of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nA well developed head of grain, seed pod or fruit indicates liberal\r\nsupplies of phosphoric acid and potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL\r\n\r\nSoils that are poor in humus are generally in need of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nHeavy soils are generally supplied with potash but lack phosphoric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nSandy soils are apt to be poor in potash and nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF FARMING\r\n\r\nA system of general or diversified farming embracing crop products and\r\nstock raising, requires much less artificial manuring than does a\r\nsystem which raises special crops or quick growing crops in rapid\r\nsuccession, as in the case of truck farming or market gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nEvery farmer should be more or less of an investigator and\r\nexperimenter.\r\n\r\nThe factors mentioned previously as indicating the presence or absence\r\nof sufficient quantities of certain plant foods serve as a general\r\nguide, but are not absolute. The best method of determining what plant\r\nfoods are lacking in the soil is to carry on some simple experiments.\r\n\r\nThe following plan for soil testing with plant foods is suggestive: To\r\ntest the soil for a possible need of the single plant foods, a series\r\nof five plots may be laid off. These plots should be long and narrow\r\nand may be one-twentieth, one-sixteenth, one-tenth, one eighth acre or\r\nlarger. A plot one rod wide and eight rods long will contain\r\none-twentieth acre. The width of the plot may be adjusted to\r\naccommodate a certain number of rows of crop and the length made\r\nproper to include an even fraction of an acre. A strip three or four\r\nfeet in width should be left between each two plots. These strips are\r\nto be left unfertilized and are for the purpose of preventing one plot\r\nbeing affected by the plant food of another.\r\n\r\nThe plots are all plowed, planted and cared for alike, the only\r\ndifference in treatment being in the application of plant food. If the\r\nplots are one-twentieth acre in size, plant foods may be applied as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 1.       |  Nitrate of Soda    8 lbs. |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 2.       |  Acid Phosphate    16 lbs. |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 3.       |  Nothing.                  |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 4.       |  Muriate of Potash  8 lbs. |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 5.       |  Lime         1 bushel.    |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\nPlot 3 is a check plot for comparison.\r\n\r\nThe measuring of the plots, weighing and application of the\r\nfertilizers, planting and care of the crops, weighing and measuring at\r\nharvest, should be carefully and accurately done.\r\n\r\nA number of additional plots may be added if desired to test the\r\neffect of plant foods in combination. For instance:\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 6.       |  Nitrate of Soda    8 lbs. |\r\n              |  Acid Phosphate    16 \"    |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 7.       |  Nitrate of Soda    8 lbs. |\r\n              |  Muriate of Potash  8 \"    |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 8.       |  Nothing.                  |\r\n              |                            |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 9.       |  Muriate of Potash  8 lbs. |\r\n              |  Acid Phosphate    16  \"   |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\nPLOT 10.      |  Nitrate of Soda    8 lbs. |\r\n              |  Acid Phosphate    16  \"   |\r\n              |  Muriate of Potash  8  \"   |\r\n              +----------------------------+\r\n\r\nIf the amount of fertilizer is too small to distribute evenly over the\r\nplot, mix it thoroughly with a few quarts of dry earth or sand to give\r\nit more bulk and then apply it.\r\n\r\nIn the use of fertilizers it should always be remembered that small\r\ncrops are not always due to lack of plant food, but may be caused by\r\nan absence of the other conditions necessary for root growth and\r\ndevelopment. The soil may not be sufficiently moist to properly supply\r\nthe plants with water. Too much water may check ventilation. Poor\r\ntillage may check root development. Unless the physical conditions are\r\nright the possible effects of additional plant food in the form of\r\nfertilizers are greatly diminished. The farmer who gets the largest\r\nreturn from fertilizers is the one who gives greatest attention to the\r\nphysical properties of the soil. He makes use of organic matter and is\r\nvery thorough in his methods of tillage. Every farmer should apply to\r\nhis State Experiment Station for bulletins on the subject of\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE ROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF CROPPING\r\n\r\nThere are two methods or systems of cropping the soil:\r\n\r\nThe One Crop System, or the continuous cropping of the soil year after\r\nyear with one kind of crop.\r\n\r\nThe Rotation of Crops or the selection of a given number of different\r\ncrops and growing them in regular order.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this chapter is to inquire into the effect of these two\r\nsystems of cropping:\r\n\r\nOn the soil conditions necessary for the best growth and development\r\nof the crops.\r\n\r\nOn the market value of the crops.\r\n\r\nOn the increase of or the protection from injurious diseases and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nOn the distribution of labor throughout the year.\r\n\r\nOn the caring for farm stock.\r\n\r\nOn the providing for home supplies.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry and the conclusion will be based on the following facts\r\nlearned in the foregoing chapters.\r\n\r\nPlant roots need for their growth and development (see Chapter II):\r\n\r\nA mellow yet firm soil.\r\n\r\nA moist soil.\r\n\r\nA ventilated soil.\r\n\r\nA warm soil.\r\n\r\nA soil supplied with plant food.\r\n\r\nDecaying organic matter or humus is one of the most important\r\ningredients of our soils. Because:\r\n\r\nIt greatly influences soil texture and therefore the conditions\r\nnecessary for root growth.\r\n\r\nIts presence or absence greatly influences the attitude of soils\r\ntoward water, the most important factor in plant growth. Its presence\r\nhelps light, sandy soils to hold more water and to better pump water\r\nfrom below, while it helps close, heavy soils to better take in the\r\nwater which falls on their surface. Its absence causes an opposite\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe presence of organic matter checks excessive ventilation in too\r\nopen, sandy soil by filling the pores, and improves poor ventilation\r\nin heavy clay soils by making them more open.\r\n\r\nHumus, on account of its color, influences the heat absorbing powers\r\nof soils.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter is constantly undergoing more or less rapid decay\r\nunless the soil be perfectly dry or frozen solid. Stirring and\r\ncultivating the soil hasten this decay.\r\n\r\nAs the organic matter decays it adds available plant food to the soil,\r\nparticularly nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAs it decays, it produces carbonic acid and other acids which are\r\nable to dissolve mineral plant food not soluble in pure water and thus\r\nrender it available to plants.\r\n\r\nPlants, although they require the same elements of plant food, take\r\nthem in different amounts and different proportions.\r\n\r\nPlants differ in the extent and depth of root growth and therefore\r\ntake food from different parts of the soil. Some are surface feeders\r\nwhile others feed on the deeper soil.\r\n\r\nPlants differ in their power to take plant food from the soil; some\r\nare weak feeders, and can use only the most available food; others are\r\nstrong feeders, and can use tougher plant food.\r\n\r\nPlants vary in the amount of heat they require to carry on their\r\ngrowth and development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONE CROP SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWe are now ready for the question. What effect has the continuous\r\ncultivation, year after year, of the same kind of crop on the soil\r\nconditions necessary to the best growth and development of that crop\r\nor any other crop? Suppose we take cotton for example.\r\n\r\nHow does cotton growing affect soil humus?\r\n\r\nDuring the cultivation of cotton, the organic matter or humus of the\r\nsoil decays in greater quantities than are added by the stalks and\r\nleaves of the crop. Therefore, cotton is a humus wasting crop, and\r\nthe continuous cultivation of this crop tends to exhaust the supply\r\nof organic matter in the soil.\r\n\r\nHow does cotton growing affect soil texture?\r\n\r\nCotton growing wastes soil humus and therefore injures soil texture by\r\nmaking the lighter soils more loose and open, and the heavier soils\r\nmore dense and compact.\r\n\r\nHow does cotton growing affect soil water?\r\n\r\nBy wasting humus cotton growing injures soil texture and so weakens\r\nthe water holding and water pumping power of light soils and weakens\r\nthe water absorbing power of heavy soils. Therefore the continuous\r\ncultivation of cotton weakens the power of the soil over water, that\r\nmost important factor in crop growth.\r\n\r\nHow does cotton growing affect soil ventilation?\r\n\r\nContinuous cotton culture, by wasting humus, injures texture and\r\ntherefore injures soil ventilation, causing too much ventilation in\r\nthe lighter soils and too little in heavier soils.\r\n\r\nHow does cotton culture affect plant food in the soil?\r\n\r\nContinuous cotton growing wastes plant food:\r\n\r\nBecause it wastes organic matter which contains valuable plant food,\r\nparticularly nitrogen.\r\n\r\nBecause by wasting organic matter it increases the leaching of the\r\nlighter soils and the surface washing of the heavier soils.\r\n\r\nBecause its roots occupy largely the upper soil and do not make use of\r\nmuch food from the lower soil.\r\n\r\nBecause it grows only during the warm part of the year and there is\r\nno crop on the land to check loss of plant food from leaching and\r\nsurface wash during the winter.\r\n\r\nBecause it is a weak feeder of phosphoric acid, and can use only that\r\nwhich is in the most available form. In applying fertilizer to cotton\r\nit is necessary for best results to apply at least twice as much\r\nphosphoric acid as the crop can use, because it can use only that\r\nwhich is in the most available form and the remainder is left in the\r\nsoil unused.\r\n\r\nContinuous cotton culture then has an injurious effect on all the\r\nimportant soil conditions necessary to its best growth and\r\ndevelopment, and the result is a diminishing yield or an increasing\r\ncost in maintaining fertility by the use of fertilizer.\r\n\r\nHow does continuous cotton culture affect the economics of the farm?\r\n\r\nThe injury to the soil conditions necessary to root growth diminishes\r\nthe yield and therefore increases the cost of production.\r\n\r\nThe poor soil conditions tend not only to diminish yield but also to\r\ndiminish the quality of the crop, which tends to lower the price\r\nreceived for the cotton.\r\n\r\nKeeping the land constantly in cotton tends to increase the insect\r\nenemies and the diseases of the crop.\r\n\r\nThe continuous growing of cotton does not permit the constant\r\nemployment of one set of laborers throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe continuous growing of cotton generally means that most of the\r\nfarm goes into cotton. A small patch of corn is planted for the stock,\r\nwhich are apt to suffer from a lack of variety in food.\r\n\r\nThe same is true with reference to home supplies. Very few vegetables\r\nare grown for the table and there is little milk, butter or eggs for\r\nhome use or exchange for groceries or drygoods at the store.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the continuous growing of cotton on the soil, year\r\nafter year, has a bad effect on conditions necessary to its best\r\ngrowth and development and also on the economics of the farm.\r\n\r\nThese facts are true to a greater or less degree in the case of nearly\r\nall of the farm crops. The grain crops are often considered as humus\r\nmakers because of the stubble turned under, but Professor Snyder, of\r\nMinnesota, found that five years' continuous culture of wheat resulted\r\nin an annual loss of 171 pounds of nitrogen per acre, of which only\r\n24.5 was taken by the crop, the remaining 146.5 pounds were lost\r\nthrough a waste of organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that instead of growing cotton on the same soil year\r\nafter year, we select four crops--cotton, corn, oats and cowpea--and\r\ngrow them in regular order, a rotation practiced in some parts of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nWe will divide the farm into three fields and number them 1, 2 and 3,\r\nand will plant these crops as indicated by the following diagrams:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of farm.]\r\n\r\nPlan for planting.\r\n\r\n                FIELD 1.

The cotton is\r\ngrown for market, the corn partly to sell, partly to feed, the oats to\r\nfeed and the cowpeas to plow under. All cotton and corn refuse is\r\nplowed under.\r\n\r\nWhat effect will such a system have on the conditions necessary for\r\nplant growth? Suppose we follow the crops on Field 1. Cotton, corn,\r\nand oats are humus wasting crops but the pea crop which is grown the\r\nthird year is plowed under, and largely, if not entirely, remedies the\r\nloss by furnishing a new supply of organic matter, and the ill effects\r\nwhich we noticed would follow the loss of organic matter due to the\r\ncontinuous growing of cotton are avoided, soil texture is preserved,\r\nsoil ventilation is not injured, and the power of the soil over water\r\nis preserved.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect on plant food in the soil?\r\n\r\nBefore answering this question let us see what amounts of plant foods\r\nthese crops take out of the soil.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the soil is a good loam at the start and will\r\nproduce:\r\n\r\nOne bale of five hundred pounds of lint cotton per acre, sixty bushels\r\nshelled corn per acre, thirty bushels oats per acre, or two tons\r\ncowpea hay per acre.\r\n\r\nSuch a yield of crop would take from the soil the following amounts of\r\nplant food per acre:\r\n\r\n----------------------+-----------+------------+------------\r\n                      |           | Phosphoric |\r\n                      | Nitrogen, | Acid,      | Potash,\r\n                      | pounds.   | pounds.    | pounds.\r\n----------------------+-----------+------------+---------\r\nCotton (whole plant)  | 103       |   41       |    65\r\nCorn (whole plant)    |  84       |   26       |    61\r\nOats (whole plant)    |  32       |   13       |    27\r\nCowpea                |  78       |   23       |    66\r\n----------------------+-----------+------------+---------\r\n\r\nNow suppose we sell the lint of the cotton, keeping all the rest of\r\nthe plant, including the seed, on the farm and turning it back into\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nOf the corn suppose we sell one-half the grain and keep the other half\r\nand the fodder for use on the farm.\r\n\r\nSuppose the oats be made into oat hay and be fed on the farm and the\r\ncowpeas be turned under.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the cowpeas take half their nitrogen from the air.\r\n\r\nThis will mean that in the course of three years we take out of the\r\nsoil of each acre in the crops:\r\n\r\n    Nitrogen.

There will be some loss of\r\nnitrogen through leaching and denitrification. Some of the potash and\r\nphosphoric acid will be converted into unavailable forms. This can be\r\nmade good by applying to the cotton a fertilizer containing twenty\r\npounds of nitrogen, sixty pounds of phosphoric acid and twenty pounds\r\nof potash.\r\n\r\nAdditional nitrogen and organic matter can be grown to turn under by\r\nplanting crimson clover in the cotton at the last working for a winter\r\ncover crop to be turned under for the corn, and by planting cowpeas or\r\nsoy beans between the rows of corn.\r\n\r\nIf this is done it may not be necessary to add any nitrogen in the\r\nfertilizer, letting that supply only phosphoric acid and potash.\r\n\r\nIf commercial fertilizer is used on the cotton, it would be a good\r\nplan to apply the manure from the stock to the corn.\r\n\r\nTo follow our crop on Field 1 through the three years we will have,\r\nfirst, cotton drawing large amounts of plant food from the soil and\r\ndiminishing the humus of the soil.\r\n\r\nGrowing a winter crop of crimson clover, turning back all the cotton\r\nrefuse except the lint and oil, and applying the barn manure will\r\nfurnish ample plant food for the corn and replenish the organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe corn is a rather stronger feeder of phosphoric acid than cotton\r\nand will be able to get sufficient from that left by the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe oats will be able to get a full ration after the corn, and the\r\ncowpeas will readily take care of themselves on the score of plant\r\nfood and will put the soil in fine condition for cotton again.\r\n\r\nThe peas may be left on the ground to turn under in the spring at\r\ncotton planting time, or they may be plowed under in the early fall\r\nand a crimson clover or vetch cover crop planted, which will be plowed\r\nunder for the cotton.\r\n\r\nThese same facts will be true of each of the three fields. The humus\r\nand, therefore, texture will be taken care of; ventilation, soil\r\ntemperature and plant food will be controlled to advantage.\r\n\r\nEach of the crops will be represented on the farm each year and the\r\nyields of each crop will be better than if grown continuously alone.\r\nThe quality and therefore the market value will be greater. Insects\r\nand disease will be easier kept in control, and stock will be more\r\neconomically furnished with a variety of foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFITS DERIVED FROM ROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\nRotation of crops economizes the natural plant food of the soil and\r\nalso that which is applied in the form of manure and fertilizer. This\r\nis because:\r\n\r\nCrops take food from the soil in different amounts and different\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nCrops differ in their feeding powers.\r\n\r\nCrops differ in the extent and depth to which they send their roots\r\ninto the soil in search of food and water.\r\n\r\nCrops differ in the time of year at which they make their best\r\ngrowths.\r\n\r\nRotation helps to maintain or improve the texture of the soil because\r\nthe amount of humus in the soil is maintained or increased by turning\r\nunder green manure and cover crops which should occur in every\r\nwell-planned rotation.\r\n\r\nRotation helps to maintain or increase the plant food in the surface\r\nsoil. When crops like cowpeas or clover which take mineral food from\r\nthe subsoil and nitrogen from the air, are plowed under, they give up\r\nthe plant food in their leaves, stems and upper roots to the surface\r\nsoil, and thus help to maintain or increase fertility.\r\n\r\nRotation tends to protect crops from injurious insects and diseases.\r\nIf one kind of crop is grown continuously on one piece of land the\r\nsoil becomes infested with the insects and diseases which injure that\r\nparticular crop. If the crop is changed, the insects and diseases find\r\ndifficulty in adapting themselves to the change and consequently\r\ndiminish in numbers.\r\n\r\nRotation helps to keep the soil free from weeds. \"If the same kind of\r\ncrop were grown year after year on the same field, the weeds which\r\ngrow most readily along with that crop would soon take possession of\r\nthe soil.\" For example, chick weed, dock, thistle, weeds peculiar to\r\ngrain and grain crops tend to increase if the land is long occupied by\r\nthese crops.\r\n\r\nRotation helps the farmer to make a more even distribution of labor\r\nthroughout the year. This is because crops differ as to the time of\r\nyear at which they are planted and harvested.\r\n\r\nRotation of crops enables the farmer to provide for his stock more\r\neconomically. Live stock fares better on a variety of food, which is\r\nmore cheaply secured by a system of rotation than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TYPICAL ROTATION\r\n\r\nA typical rotation for general farming should contain at least:\r\n\r\nOne money crop which is necessarily an exhaustive crop.\r\n\r\nOne manurial crop which is a soil enricher.\r\n\r\nOne feeding crop which diminishes fertility only a little.\r\n\r\nOne cleansing crop, a hoed or cultivated crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS WHICH MODIFY THE ROTATION\r\n\r\nThere are certain conditions which tend to modify the rotation or to\r\ninfluence the farmer in his choice of crops. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst of all the climate will set a limit on the number and varieties\r\nof crops from which a choice can be made for a given locality.\r\n\r\nThe kind of farming which he chooses to carry on, whether stock\r\nraising, grain farming, truck farming, or a combination of two or more\r\nof these, or others.\r\n\r\nKind of soil. Certain soils are best adapted to particular crops. For\r\nexample, heavy soils are best suited to wheat, grass, clover,\r\ncabbages, etc. Light, sandy soils to early truck, certain grades of\r\ntobacco, etc.\r\n\r\nThe demand for crops and their market value.\r\n\r\nFacilities for getting crops to market, good or bad country roads,\r\nrailroads and water transportation.\r\n\r\nThe state of the land with respect to weeds, insect pests and plant\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES\r\n\r\nA few general rules may be made use of in arranging the order of the\r\ncrops in the rotation though they cannot always be strictly followed.\r\n\r\nCrops that require the elements of plant food in the same proportion\r\nshould not follow each other.\r\n\r\nDeep-rooted crops should alternate with shallow-rooted crops.\r\n\r\nHumus makers should alternate with humus wasters.\r\n\r\nEvery well arranged rotation should have at least one crop grown for\r\nits manurial effect on the soil, as a crop of cowpeas, or one of\r\nclover, to be turned under.\r\n\r\nThe objection often made to this last rule is that, aside from the\r\nincrease in fertility, there is no direct return for the time, labor\r\nand seed, and the land brings no crop for a year. It is not necessary\r\nto use the entire crop for green manuring--a part of it may be used\r\nfor hay or for pasture with little loss of the manurial value of the\r\ncrop, provided the manure from that part of the crop taken off is\r\nreturned and the part of the crop not removed is turned under.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF THE ROTATION\r\n\r\nThe length of the rotation may vary from a two-course or two crop\r\nrotation to one of several courses. Crimson clover may be alternated\r\nwith corn, both crops being grown within a year.\r\n\r\nA three-course rotation, popular in some parts of the country, is\r\nwheat, clover, and potatoes; potatoes being the money crop and\r\ncleansing crop, wheat a secondary money crop or feeding crop, and\r\nclover the manurial and feeding crop.\r\n\r\nA popular four-course rotation is corn, potatoes or truck, small\r\ngrain, clover; the potatoes being the chief money crop, corn the\r\nfeeding crop, the small grain the secondary money or feeding crop, and\r\nclover the manurial and feeding crop.\r\n\r\nOn many New England farms near towns, hay and straw are the chief\r\nmoney crops. Here the rotation is grass two or more years, then a\r\ncleansing crop and a grain crop. A Canadian rotation is wheat, hay,\r\npasture, oats, peas. A rotation for the South might be corn, crimson\r\nclover, cotton, crimson clover; this rotation covering a period of two\r\nyears. A South Carolina rotation is oats, peas, cotton, corn--a\r\nthree-year rotation. It might be improved as follows: Oats, peas,\r\ncrimson clover, cotton, crimson clover, corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nFARM DRAINAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome farm lands contain so much water that the conditions of fertility\r\nare interfered with and therefore the crop producing power of these\r\nlands is lowered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SURPLUS WATER AFFECTS FERTILITY\r\n\r\nThis surplus water diminishes fertility by reducing the area of film\r\nwater in the soil.\r\n\r\nIt checks soil ventilation.\r\n\r\nIt tends to keep the soil cold.\r\n\r\nIt dilutes plant food in the soil.\r\n\r\nIt interferes with proper tillage.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF A NEED OF DRAINAGE\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned state of affairs occurs sometimes in fields at the\r\nfoot of hills, or on sloping uplands which receive spring water or\r\nseepage water from higher lands. Some fields are underlaid by a close,\r\ncompact subsoil which so checks percolation that the surface soil is\r\ntoo wet for tillage operations the greater part of the year. In such\r\ncases:\r\n\r\nA need of drainage is generally indicated by the presence of more or\r\nless free water standing on the surface.\r\n\r\nIn some lands the surface water does not appear as free water standing\r\non the surface. In such cases:\r\n\r\nA need of drainage is indicated by the curling and wilting of the\r\nleaves of corn and other crops during dry, hot weather. This curling\r\nand wilting is due to the fact that during the early growth of the\r\ncrop free water stands so high in the soil that the crop roots are\r\nconfined to a shallow layer of soil. When dry, hot weather comes, the\r\nfree water recedes, the upper soil dries out, and the roots cannot get\r\nsufficient water to supply the demands of transpiration, hence the\r\ncurling and wilting of the leaves.\r\n\r\nIf drains are placed in this soil, the free water will be kept at a\r\nlower level in the spring and the plant roots will develop deeper in\r\nthe soil, where there will be constant supply of film water during the\r\ndryer and warmer summer weather.\r\n\r\nThe wiry and spindling growth of grass and grain crops may indicate\r\ntoo much water.\r\n\r\nThe growth of moss on the surface of the ground and the cracking of\r\nthe soil in dry weather are also indications of too much water.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINS\r\n\r\nHow can we get rid of this surplus free water?\r\n\r\nWe can make passageways through the soil to a lower level and then\r\nlet gravity pull the water through them to lower ground below. These\r\npassageways are called drains.\r\n\r\nDrains may be classed as:\r\n\r\nSurface drains which are shallow, open channels made in the soil with\r\na plow, hoe or other tool, to carry off surface water. They are\r\ntemporary and need frequent renewing.\r\n\r\nOpen-ditch drains are deeper, more permanent water passageways around\r\nor across the fields.\r\n\r\nSurface and open-ditch drains take only surface water. They also carry\r\noff surface soil and manures washed into them. They frequently become\r\nchoked or stopped by trash and soil, and are in the way of cultivation\r\nand harvesting operations.\r\n\r\nCovered drains, under drains or blind ditches are water passageways\r\nmade of brush, poles, stones, tiles, etc. (Figs. 80-81), placed in the\r\nbottoms of ditches and then covered with soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF COVERED OR UNDER DRAINS ON FERTILITY\r\n\r\n_Influence on soil water._\r\n\r\nCovered or under drains take not only surface water, but also remove\r\nfree water from the soil beneath down to nearly the level of the\r\nbottom of the drains, and thus increase the area of film water.\r\nRemoving the free water enables the soil to absorb more readily rain\r\nwater falling on the surface and therefore checks surface wash and the\r\ngullying of fields.\r\n\r\n_Influence on soil ventilation._\r\n\r\nLowering the free water allows a deeper penetration of air and,\r\ntherefore, a deeper root development and enables crops to better\r\nresist dry periods.\r\n\r\n_Influence on soil temperature._\r\n\r\nLowering the free water in the soil influences soil temperature:\r\n\r\nBy diminishing the amount of water to be heated.\r\n\r\nBy checking evaporation.\r\n\r\nBy letting warm showers sink down into the soil.\r\n\r\nBy increasing ventilation and therefore permitting the circulation of\r\nwarm air in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe cropping season is lengthened by causing the soil to be warmer and\r\ndrier earlier in the spring and later in the fall.\r\n\r\n_Influence on plant food in the soil._\r\n\r\nCovered or under drains check losses of plant food that occur with\r\nsurface and open ditch drains. They render available more plant food,\r\nfor lowering free water and increasing ventilation:\r\n\r\nDeepen the feeding area of the roots.\r\n\r\nAid the process of nitrification.\r\n\r\nAid chemical changes which make plant food available.\r\n\r\nCheck denitrification.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF DRAINS\r\n\r\nAs gravity is the force that is to take the surplus water from the\r\nsoil, the outlet of the drainage system should be at the lowest part\r\nof the area to be drained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--CROSS-SECTIONS OF STONE-DRAINS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.\r\n_A._ Cross-section of a pole-drain. _B._ Cross-section of a\r\ntile-drain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--A COLLECTION OF DRAINAGE TOOLS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.\r\n_A_ represents a poorly laid tile-drain. It is poorly graded, and has\r\npartly filled with soil. It has lost more than half its water carrying\r\ncapacity. _B_ was properly graded, and has kept free from sediment.]\r\n\r\nThe main drains should be located in the lowest parts of the fields,\r\nindicated by courses taken by water after a rain or by small streams\r\nrunning through the farm.\r\n\r\nThe lateral drains, if surface or open ditch drains, should run across\r\nthe slopes; if under drains, they should run up and down the slopes.\r\n\r\n_Grade or slope of the drain._\r\n\r\nThe grade of the drain should be sufficient to cause a flow of the\r\nwater. In the case of open ditches it should not be steep enough to\r\ncause too rapid a current and a consequent serious washing of the\r\nbanks of the ditch. Large, deep ditches will carry water with a grade\r\nof one inch to a hundred feet.\r\n\r\n_Tile drains._\r\n\r\nCovered or under drains are made of brush, poles, planks, stones,\r\ntiles, etc. (Figs. 83-84). Where tiles can be obtained at reasonable\r\nprices they are considered best. Tiles are made of clay and are burnt\r\nlike brick. They are more lasting than wood and are easier and cheaper\r\nto lay than stone, unless the stone must be gotten rid of.\r\n\r\nThe most approved form of drain tile is the round or circular form.\r\nThese are made in sizes ranging from two and one-half to six and eight\r\ninches in diameter, and in pieces one foot in length.\r\n\r\nThe size used depends on the length of the drain, the amount of water\r\nto carry, the frequency of heavy rainfalls and the character of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe distance apart varies from twenty-five feet in heavy soils to\r\nover two hundred feet in light soils. The usual depth is about three\r\nfeet, though the farther apart the deeper they are put.\r\n\r\nA lateral tile drain should enter a main at an acute angle to prevent\r\ntoo great a check in the current.\r\n\r\nIn putting in a drainage system the first thing to be done is to make\r\na plan of the ground and determine the slope of the land and the grade\r\nof the drain. The ditches are then staked out and the digging\r\nproceeds. In digging the ditches plows are sometimes used to throw out\r\nthe top soil, then the work is finished with spades and shovels.\r\n\r\nProfessional ditchers use special tools and they take out only\r\nsufficient earth to make room for the tiles (Fig. 85). The tiles are\r\nthen laid end to end, the joints covered with a piece of sod, some\r\ngrass, straw, paper or clay, to prevent loose soil sifting in. As the\r\ntiles are laid, enough soil is placed on them to hold them in place\r\nuntil the ditch is filled.\r\n\r\nIn laying the tiles an even grade should be maintained (Fig. 86). A\r\nlessening of the grade checks the current of water and tends to cause\r\na stoppage of the drain.\r\n\r\nThe water gets into the drain through the joints where the tiles come\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe outlet of a tile drain should be protected by brick work or should\r\nbe of glazed tile such as the so-called terra-cotta tile, to prevent\r\ninjury by frost.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the drain should be protected by a screen of wire to\r\nprevent the entrance of rats and other small animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Acid=, a chemical name given to many sour substances.\r\n\r\n=Albumen=, a nitrogenous organic compound.\r\n\r\n=Albuminoid=, a nitrogenous substance resembling albumen.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia=, a gas containing nitrogen produced by the decay of organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n=Annual=, a plant that lives only one year; corn and sunflower are\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n=Anther=, the part of a stamen that bears the pollen.\r\n\r\n=Available=, that which can be used.\r\n\r\n=Bacteria=, very small plants, so small that they cannot be seen\r\nwithout the aid of a powerful microscope.
