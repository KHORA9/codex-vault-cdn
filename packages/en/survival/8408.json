OBITUARY.--Achille Delesse, eminent as geologist and mineralogist\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACHILLE DELESSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of this distinguished man must be recorded. An interesting\r\n_résumé_ of his labors by M. Daubree has appeared, from which we take\r\nthe following facts. After a training in his native town at the Lyceum\r\nof Metz, which furnished so many scholars to the Polytechnic school,\r\nDelesse was admitted at the age of twenty to this school. In 1839 he\r\nleft to enter the Corps des Mines. From the beginning of his career the\r\nstudent engineer applied himself with ardor to the sciences to which\r\nhe was to devote his entire existence. The journeys which he undertook\r\nthen, and continued later, in France, Germany, Poland, England, and\r\nIreland, helped to confirm and develop the bent of his mind. He soon\r\narrived at important scientific results, and was rewarded, in 1845, by\r\nhaving conferred to him by the university the course of mineralogy and\r\ngeology in the Faculty at Besançon, where Delesse at the same time\r\nfulfilled the duties of engineer of mines. Five years later he returned\r\nto Paris, where he continued his university duties, at first as deputy\r\nof the course of geology at the Sorbonne, then as master of the\r\nconferences at the Superior Normal School. Besides this, he continued\r\nhis profession of engineer of mines as inspector of the roads of Paris.\r\nThe first original researches of the young _savant_ concern pure\r\nmineralogy; he studied a certain number of species, of which the\r\nchemical nature was yet uncertain or altogether unknown, and his name\r\nwas appended to one of the species which he defined. He studied\r\nalso, and with success, the interesting modifications called\r\npseudomorphism--the mode of association of minerals, as well as their\r\nmagnetic properties. The attributes of a practical mineralogist aided\r\nhim greatly in the culture of a branch of geology to which Delesse has\r\nrendered eminent services, in the recognition of rocks of igneous origin\r\nand of others allied to them. He studied in the field, as well as by\r\ninvestigations in the laboratory, for fifteen years, with an intelligent\r\nand indefatigable perseverance, and, aided by the results of hundreds of\r\nanalyses, eruptive masses of the most varied kind, the knowledge derived\r\nfrom which threw light upon the principles of science, from granites\r\nand syenites to melaphyres and basalts. After thirty years of study\r\nand progress, other _savants_, without differing from him, progressed\r\nfurther in the intimate knowledge of rocks; but the historian of\r\nscience will not forget that Delesse was the precursor of this order\r\nof research. His studies of metamorphism will long do him honor. The\r\nmineralogical modifications which the eruptive rocks have undergone in\r\nthe mass are the permanent witnesses which attracted all his attention.\r\nThe chemical comparison of the metamorphic with the normal rock pointed\r\nout distinctly the nature of the substances acquired or lost. One of the\r\nprincipal results of these analyses has been to lessen the importance\r\nattributed until then to heat alone, and to show in more than one case\r\nthe intervention of thermal sources and of other emanations from below,\r\nto which the eruptive rocks have simply opened up tracks.\r\n\r\nIt is not only upon subjects relating to the history of rocks that\r\nDelesse has touched. Witness his work on the infiltration of water, as\r\nwell as his volume relating to the materials of construction, published\r\non the occasion of the Exhibition of 1855. The nature of the deposits\r\nwhich operate continually at the bottom of the sea offers points of\r\ninterest which well repay the labor of the geologist. He finds there,\r\nindeed, a precious field to be compared with stratified deposits; for\r\nin spite of the enormous depth to which they form a part of continents,\r\nthey are of analogous origin. Delesse laboriously studied the products\r\nof the innumerable soundings taken in most of the seas. He arranged the\r\nresults in a work which has become classical with the beautiful atlas of\r\nsubmarine drawings which accompany it. Though he never slackened in his\r\nown especial work, he made much of the work of others. The \"Revue des\r\nProgrès de la Géologie,\" with which he enriched the \"Annales des Mines\"\r\nfor twenty years, would have been sufficient to engross the time of a\r\nless active scientific man, and one less ready to grasp the opening of a\r\ndiscovery. This indefatigable theorist never neglected the applications\r\nof science: the nature and the changes of the layers which form the\r\nunder earth; the course and the depth of the subterraneous sheets of\r\nwater; the mineralogical composition of the earth's vegetation, were\r\nrepresented by him on several charts and plans drawn out in proper form.\r\nHis maps which follow the route of many of the great French lines of\r\nrailway explain the kind of soil upon which they are laid, and are of\r\ndaily use. In the pursuit of his numerous scientific works, Delesse\r\nnever failed in discharging his duties in the Corps des Mines. Having\r\nin 1864 quitted the service of the Government of Paris, which he had\r\noccupied for eighteen years, he was made professor of agriculture, of\r\ndrainage, and irrigation, at the School of Mines, where he established\r\ninstruction in these before being called to found the course of geology\r\nat the Agricultural Institution. Promoted to be Inspector-General of\r\nMines in 1878, and charged with the division of the south east of\r\nFrance, he preserved to the end of his life these new duties, for which,\r\nto the regret of the School of Mines, he gave up his excellent lessons\r\nthere. During the year of 1870 Delesse fulfilled his duties as a\r\ncitizen, as engineer in preparation of cartridges in the department.\r\n\r\nHis nomination to the Academy of Sciences, which took place on the 6th\r\nof January, 1879, satisfied the ambition of his life. He was for two\r\nyears President of the Central Commission of the Geographical Society;\r\nhe was also President of the Geological Society. He was not long to\r\nenjoy the noble position acquired by his intelligence and his work.\r\nHe suffered from a serious malady, which, however, did not weaken his\r\nintellect, and he continued from his bed of suffering to prepare the\r\nreports for the Council-General of Mines, and that which recently he\r\naddressed to the Academy on the occasion of his election. The greatness\r\nand the rectitude of mind of Delesse, his astounding power of work, his\r\nprofound knowledge of science, his sympathetic sweetness, which were\r\nassociated with sterling modesty and loyalty of character, made him\r\nesteemed and cherished throughout his whole career. He died on the 24th\r\nof March.--_The Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGGESTIONS IN DECOTATIVE ART.--SILVER EWER, BY ODIOT,\r\nPARIS.\r\n\r\n(From The Workshop)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC LIGHT AT EARNOCK COLLIERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 9, Earnock Colliery, near Hamilton, belonging\r\nto Mr. John Watson, of Earnock, was the scene of an interesting\r\nceremonial which may well be said to mark a new era in mining annals.\r\nIn proceeding to win the rich mineral wealth of his estate, Mr. Watson\r\ndetermined that, in respect of fittings, machinery, and general\r\nappointments, it should be a model, and he has been highly successful\r\nin giving practical effect to his aims. Among other things, he early\r\nresolved to, if at all practicable, substitute the electric light for\r\nthe ordinary mode of illuminating the workings, and after investigating\r\nthe various systems, he decided on giving that of Mr. Swan a trial.\r\nAccordingly, since April last, Messrs. D. & E. Graham, electrical\r\nengineers, Glasgow, have been engaged fitting up the Swan incandescent\r\nlamp, with modifications, to adapt it for safe use in the mine, and on\r\nTuesday the inauguration of the new light took place in presence of a\r\nlarge company of leading gentlemen from Glasgow, Hamilton, and the West.\r\nArrived at the colliery about half-past one o'clock, the visitors were\r\nreceived by Mr. Watson, and after a brief space spent in inspecting\r\nthe three magnificent winding and fan engines, the Guibal fan, and the\r\nframework for screening the coal, they were conducted by Mr. James\r\nGilchrist, manager, down into the workings in the ell seam at a depth\r\nof 118 fathoms. Here at the pit bottom, in the roads and at the face,\r\ntwenty-one Swan lamps were burning, giving forth a brilliant, steady\r\nflame, the luminosity of which, while sufficient to supply the desired\r\nlight, had none of the disagreeable intensity associated with most\r\nsystems of electric lighting. Besides the pear-shaped Swan lamp, in\r\nwhich the glowing or incandescence is carried on _in vacuo_, there is an\r\nouter lantern, the invention of Mr. David Graham, consisting of a strong\r\nglass globe, air-tight, protected with steel guards. Each lamp was also\r\nconnected with two different forms of Graham's patent safety air tight\r\ncontacts and switches for cutting off and letting on the current, the\r\neffect of which, it is believed, would be to render the lamps quite\r\nsafe, even in the presence of explosive gas. At first the intention\r\nwas to employ the fan-engine to drive the dynamo-electric machine or\r\ngenerator, but this was departed from, and an engine of 12 horse-power\r\nwas erected in the workshops on the surface for the purpose. From the\r\ngenerator the electric cables, two in number, are conducted along the\r\nroof of the workshops over ordinary telegraph poles to the pit-head at\r\nNo. 2 shaft, and thence down into the workings. From the ridge of the\r\nworkshops to the pithead, a distance of several hundred yards, the\r\ncables consist of ordinary copper wire, three-eighths of an inch in\r\ndiameter; inside the workshop and below ground, to allow of their safe\r\nhandling, they are composed of insulated wires, while on the way down\r\nthe shaft they are inclosed in a galvanized tube. Near the bottom of the\r\nshaft, branches are taken off to supply light to the principal roadways\r\nand to the haulage engine-room, the main cables being carried into one\r\nof the sections of the mine a distance of half-a-mile. After a careful\r\ninspection of the lamps at the pit bottom, the party were photographed\r\nin three groups, with the aid of the electric light, by Mr. Annan, of\r\nGlasgow, who may well be credited with the distinction of being the\r\nfirst to exercise his skill in the bowels of the earth. They were\r\nthen led to the haulage engine-room and into the workings, where they\r\nwitnessed the effects of the light. At the latter point, while, of\r\ncourse, the visitors were at a safe distance, a shot was fired, bringing\r\ndown a large mass of coal. Having spent fully an hour below ground, the\r\nparty returned to the surface.--_Colliery Guardian_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING AND TELEPHONE WIRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Bede, of Brussels, has an article in _L'Ingénieur-Conseil_ on the\r\nabove subject. He considers that a system of such wires forms the best\r\nand most complete security against lightning with which a town can be\r\nprovided, because they protect not only the buildings in which they\r\nterminate, but also those over which they pass. At each end they\r\ncommunicate with the earth, and thus carry off safely any surplus\r\nof electricity with which they may become charged. It is, however,\r\nimportant that they should be provided with lightning conductors of\r\ntheir own, to carry off such surplus directly from the transmission wire\r\nto the earth wire, without allowing it to pass through the fine wires of\r\nthe induction coils, which it might fuse.\r\n\r\nSuch lightning conductors usually consist of a toothed plate attached to\r\none wire, close to another plate not toothed attached to the other wire.\r\nThe copper even of such a conductor has been melted by the powerful\r\ncurrent which it has carried away. In telephonic central offices, M.\r\nBede has seen all the signals of one row of telephone wires fall at the\r\nsame moment, proving that an electric discharge had fallen upon the\r\nwires, and been by them conveyed to earth.\r\n\r\nThis fact shows that wires, even without points, are capable of\r\nattracting the atmospheric electricity; but it must be remembered that\r\nthere are two points at every join in the wire. M. Bede insists strongly\r\nupon the uselessness of terminating lightning conductors in wells,\r\nor even larger pieces of water. The experiments of MM. Becquerel\r\nand Pouillet proved that the resistance of water to the passage of\r\nelectricity is one thousand million times greater than that of iron;\r\nconsequently, if the current conveyed by a wire one square mm. thick\r\nwere to be carried off by water without increased resistance, a surface\r\nof contact between the wire and the water of not less than 1,000 square\r\nmeters must be established.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a wire let down into a well is simply useless. On\r\nthe two-fluid theory, it offers no effectual way of escape to the\r\nterrestrial electricity; according to the older views, it would be\r\nabsolutely dangerous, by attracting more electricity from the clouds\r\nthan it could dispose of. The author advocates connecting lightning\r\nconductors with water or gas pipes, which have an immense surface of\r\ncontact with the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF FLAMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments of the author have been principally directed to the\r\nalterations in shape and color produced in a flame when under the\r\ninfluence of positive or negative electricity. The flames were arranged\r\nso as to form one electrode of a frictional machine. When charged with\r\npositive electricity the flame became more blue, narrower, and pointed\r\nat the top, while little or nothing of the result was observed in\r\nnegative flames.\r\n\r\nA peculiar result is that the end of a negative flame returns to its own\r\nconductor, and that, according to the intensity of the electricity, and\r\nalso depending on the width of the burner, this turning back of the\r\nflame is either intermittent or constant. Most noticeable are these\r\nresults:\r\n\r\nWhen the flame rises from a circular burner, or when burning round a\r\nmetallic cylinder, in the latter case it returns to the metallic surface\r\naccording to the intensity of electricity in an arc or angle, while the\r\npoint of the flame divides into two branches, which separately perform\r\nmore or less equal movements. If a body connected to the earth by a\r\nconducting wire is held opposite the flame at some distance, the flame\r\nwill in all cases bend toward it; as the body is brought closer,\r\nthe flame, if negative, will be repulsed, and, if positive, will be\r\nattracted, at least the upper luminous part of the flame, while the\r\nlower dark body of flame is also repulsed.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon explains why a positive flame will burn through wire\r\ngauze, while a negative flame remains below the gauze. The positive\r\nflame becoming pointed explains the fact that this will drive a small\r\nfan wheel, while a negative flame will only just move it.\r\n\r\nAll these results are most prominently obtained with a pure gas flame, a\r\nstearine, wax, or tallow candle, very indifferently with a spirit flame,\r\nand least from a Bunsen flame rich in oxygen. They may not only be\r\nobtained with flames electrified direct, but also when placed under the\r\ninfluence of a long \"Holtz\" machine.\r\n\r\nA flame placed between two small disks on the machine bends toward the\r\nnegative pole, becomes widened, and, at a certain point of electric\r\nintensity, commences to vibrate and oscillate, exhibiting a peculiar\r\nstratification. Since these phenomena are also least observed in flames\r\nrich in oxygen, it appears to be a general law that carbon and hydrogen\r\nare more strongly attracted by the negative pole, while oxygen is\r\nmore attracted by the positive pole, probably like in all polar\r\ndifferentially attractions, in consequence of a peculiar unipolar\r\nconductivity of the substances.\r\n\r\nThe return motion of the flame the author explains thus: The point\r\nof the flame loses more electricity by influence than it receives by\r\nconductivity. A paper strip fixed at one end to a large ball shows\r\nsimilar movements when its free end is pointed and made conductive.\r\nWhy principally the negative flame returns may be explained in two\r\nways--either the point of the flame loses much by radiation, or the base\r\nof the flame is a bad conductor. The former explanation would agree with\r\nthe experiments made by Wiedemann and Ruhlmann, the latter with Erdman's\r\ntheory of unipolar conductivity of flames. This theory is still further\r\nsupported by the resistance on the negative electrodes noticed by\r\nHittorf, which almost explains Erdman's experiments, because if negative\r\nelectricity enters a flame with greater difficulty, then positive\r\nelectricity must leave a flame with difficulty.--_W. Holtz, in\r\nWiedemanris Beiblätter to Poggendorfs Annalen._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC STOP-MOTION IN THE COTTON MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of inventions for use as stop-motions in and about the\r\nvarious machines in the cotton mill has been to a certain extent\r\nsomething like the search after perpetual motion. Very available and\r\nquite satisfactory stop-motions have for a number of years been employed\r\nwherever the thread or sliver has been twisted so that strength was\r\ngiven it to resist a slight amount of friction, but the main trouble\r\nin the mill has been done after the sliver leaves the railway head and\r\nduring its transit in the various processes employed between the railway\r\nhead and the spinning frame or mule. Every carder or spinner knows that\r\nwhere an injury comes to the sliver because the sliver is soft, but\r\npartially condensed and very susceptible to injury, the injury is\r\nmagnified and multiplied in every successive process. Virtually the\r\nfield was long since abandoned for an accurate quick-working motion that\r\nshould be applicable to any and all the machines and to every sliver or\r\nstrand of the machine.\r\n\r\nThis invention was solved practically about two years since, and is\r\nnow being employed as applied to drawing frames, doublers, speeder,\r\nintermediate, and slubber. It is a very cunning mechanical appliance,\r\ntoo, and has found favor to a great extent in England, where several\r\nthousand heads of drawing and speeders are already supplied.\r\n\r\nThis invention was exhibited at the Centennial in 1876, although in a\r\nsomewhat crude state. Since that time it has been materially improved,\r\nand mechanically is very nearly perfect now. Many attempts have been\r\nmade to apply a stop motion, which should be quick in its movement and\r\naccurate in its result, to carding engines or the card, not one of\r\nwhich, until the application of electricity, was worth the time spent in\r\nputting it on. With the electric motion, however, all this is changed,\r\nand the electric attachments are not of necessity so fragile as to be\r\nun-mechanical or to be not practical. The advantage has also been\r\ntaken, in a mechanical way, of using cotton as one element, and, being\r\nnon-conducting, so that no trouble shall arise from contact with the\r\nworking parts of the electrical apparatus with the cotton itself.\r\n\r\nTo take into consideration all the possibilities that exist from the\r\nrailway can to the front of the fine speeder is not needed by the\r\npractical reader, and would be useless to any other. The principle of\r\nthis invention is the supplying of a magneto-electric current from\r\na small magneto-electric machine attached to the card, speeder, or\r\nwhatever machine it may be applied to which generates the current, and\r\nthis machine is driven by a small belt from the main driving shaft.\r\nThe machine in itself weighs but a few pounds, and can be driven by a\r\nhalf-inch or three quarter-inch belt, and requires a little more power\r\nthan a light-running sewing machine.\r\n\r\nOne pole of the magneto-electric machine is connected by means of a rod\r\nor wire to the machine frame upon which it is to be used, and the\r\nother pole to the electromagnet in the ordinary way of conductivity\r\nof current, which means stretching the wire from one to the other. An\r\narmature is arranged so that when a thread is broken or a sliver or a\r\nstrand of roving, the armature drops into a ratchet wheel; this ratchet\r\nwheel is made to revolve by the belt, and whenever it is impeded or\r\nstopped in its course it acts upon mechanism which throws the driving\r\nbelt of the machine upon the loose pulley. Electrical contact is made by\r\na very simple contrivance, and these attachments are only to act in the\r\ncase of a breakage of a thread or strand.\r\n\r\nAs applied to a card, the calender rolls are both connected, one with\r\nthe negative and one with the positive pole; when the sliver of cotton\r\nis between the calender rolls there is no connection, but if the sheet\r\nbreaks down between the cone and the calender roll, the moment the\r\ncalender rolls come in contact the electrical attachment operates and a\r\nstoppage ensues; and in the case, as with the American system, where a\r\nnumber of cards are used in a railway, this electric contact may be used\r\nfor either one of two purposes-to stop the feeding of cotton into the\r\ncard, or to ring a bell sharply and continue ringing it until the sliver\r\nis put between the calender rolls again and the card set to delivering\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nIn drawing frames it may be attached so that, in the case of a breakage\r\nbetween the front roll and the calender roll, the electric machine acts;\r\nin the case of a lap upon one of the rolls or one end of the roll, or\r\nin case of breakage of the sliver at the back of the machine, in either\r\ncase a stoppage would be instantly produced.\r\n\r\nIn being applied to the slubber a breakage either at the front or back\r\ncan be arranged for. Upon intermediates the breakage of either one of\r\nthe strands, if the machine was running two into one, from the creel to\r\nthe roller, would cause the stoppage of the machine, or the breaking or\r\ntangling of ends between the front roll and the nose of the flier.\r\n\r\nThere are many other places where this motion can be applied. With\r\nmechanical means we require motion; with electricity we require simple\r\ncontact of two differently arranged surfaces, and this can always be\r\nhad by letting the cotton drop out from between the rollers; no radical\r\nchanges are necessary, and we are glad to find that this electrical\r\nattachment is meeting with a very good success in England, France,\r\nand, so far, in the United States, and, undoubtedly, further and more\r\nextended opportunity will be found for this application.--_Textile\r\nRecord_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARINE ENGINE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper recently read before the Society of Mechanical\r\nEngineers by F.C.Marshall.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author began by referring to a paper read at the Liverpool meeting\r\nin 1872, by Mr. F.

Bramwell, F.R.S., on \"The Progress effected in\r\nEconomy of Fuel in Steam Navigation, considered in Relation to Compound\r\nCylinder Engines and High-pressure Steam;\" then proceeded to continue\r\nthe subject from the date of that meeting, to trace out whether any, and\r\nif so what, progress had been made; further, to consider whether or no\r\nwe have reached the finality so strongly deprecated by Sir Frederick\r\nBramwell in the discussion referred to, and, if not, then in what\r\ndirection we are to look for further development.\r\n\r\nFrom a table it would seem that the steam pressures are now much higher,\r\nthe boilers have less heating surface, and the cylinders are much\r\nsmaller for the indicated horsepower developed than in 1872; and at the\r\nsame time the average consumption of fuel is reduced from 2.11 lb. to\r\n1.828 lb., or by 13.38 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE ENGINES.\r\n\r\nThe author then briefly described the modern marine engine and boiler.\r\nThe three great types of compound engines may be placed as follows in\r\nthe order of their general acceptance by the shipowning community: (1)\r\nThe two-cylinder intermediate-receiver compound engine, having cranks at\r\nright angles. (2) The Woolf engine in the tandem form, having generally\r\nthe high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders in line with each other,\r\nbut occasionally alongside, and always communicating their power to one\r\ncrank. Such a pair of engines is used sometimes singly, oftener two\r\npairs together, working side by side to cranks at right angles; recently\r\nthree pairs together, working to cranks placed 120 deg. apart. The\r\nsystem affords the opportunity of adding yet more engines to the\r\nsame propeller to an indefinite extent. (3) The three cylinder\r\nintermediate-receiver compound engine, with one high and two\r\nlow-pressure cylinders, the steam passing from the high-pressure\r\ncylinder into the receiver, and thence into the two low-pressure\r\ncylinders respectively. The cranks are placed at equal angles apart\r\nround the crank shaft, so as to balance the forces exerted upon the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThese three types may be said to embrace all the engines now being\r\nmanufactured in this country for the propulsion of steam vessels by the\r\nscrew propeller. In their leading principles they also embrace\r\nnearly all paddle engines now being built, whether the cylinders be\r\noscillating, fixed vertically, or inclined to the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe compound engine, in fact, in one of these three forms, may now be\r\nsaid to be universally adopted in this country; and the question of the\r\nrelative value of simple expansion in one cylinder, and of compound\r\nexpansion in two or more cylinders, which agitated the minds of some of\r\nour leading engineers ten years ago, is now practically solved in favor\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARINE BOILER.\r\n\r\nThe marine boiler of to-day is in all its main features the same as it\r\nwas ten years ago. The single-ended boiler, made with two, three, and\r\nsometimes four furnaces, is the simplest form, and for all powers\r\nunder 500 indicated horse power is the most generally adopted. The\r\ndouble-ended form is largely used. It has been found more economically\r\nefficient than the single-ended form, by as much as ten per cent, in the\r\nwriter's own experience. It is generally adopted for engines of large\r\npower, but for small power is inconvenient, owing to its occupying more\r\nroom lengthwise in the vessel, and also involving two stokeholds and\r\ntherefore more supervision. At one time great difficulty was found\r\nin keeping the bottoms of boilers of this kind tight. Owing to their\r\nlength, the unequal expansion due to different temperatures at the\r\ntop and bottom caused severe racking strains on the bottom seams and\r\nriveting--so severe in some cases as to rend the plating for a large\r\npart of the bottom circumference of the shell. This difficulty has now\r\nbeen to a large extent got over, in consequence of the greater attention\r\ngiven to the form and direction of the water spaces in the boiler\r\nitself, so as to induce circulation of water; the introduction of the\r\nfeed-water at the top instead of near the bottom; the more careful\r\nmanagement now usual on the part of engineers; and lastly, the use of\r\nlarger plates, welded horizontal seams, drilled rivet holes, and more\r\nperfect workmanship throughout. A modification of double-ended boiler is\r\nthat introduced by Mr. Alfred Holt. It has many decided advantages,\r\nbut is costly to make. The formation of the two ends into separate\r\nfire-boxes leaves the bottom of the boiler free to adapt itself to the\r\nvariations of temperature to which it is exposed. The separation of the\r\nfurnaces from the combustion chamber, excepting through the opening\r\nafforded by a connecting tube, is an advantage in the same direction,\r\nand avoids almost entirely the racking strains due to irregular furnace\r\naction. The weight of water carried is less, and that of the boiler\r\nmay also be made less; while the elliptical form of the two ends gives\r\ngreater steam space.\r\n\r\nA type of boiler largely used in her Majesty's Navy, somewhat like a\r\nlocomotive boiler, is highly efficient in regard to weight and power\r\ndeveloped. Many examples have yielded one indicated horse-power in the\r\ncylinders for every three square feet of heating surface, under natural\r\ndraught and with a very moderate height of funnel; and this with a\r\nconsumption of fuel not exceeding 2½ lb. per indicated horse-power per\r\nhour under a working pressure of 60 lb. With the aid of a steam jet in\r\nthe funnel, the heating surface per indicated horse-power has fallen\r\nbelow 2½ square feet. The large water surface afforded for escape\r\nof steam secures almost entire freedom from priming, without the\r\nincumbrance of steam domes; and the large combustion chamber allows of\r\nthe thorough combustion of the gases before their passage through the\r\ntubes. The locomotive type of boiler has lately occupied the writer's\r\nattention, with a view to its more definite introduction into marine\r\nwork. The difficulties, however, which lie in the way of applying it to\r\nsteamers going long voyages are very great. The principal difficulty\r\nlies in the necessity of burning a large quantity of fuel in a very\r\nlimited space and time. This can only be done either by direct pressure\r\nor exhaust action applied at the furnace. In other words, we must either\r\nexhaust the funnel, which will absorb a large amount of power, but would\r\nbe comparatively easy of application; or our stokers, as is the case\r\nwith our miners, must work under a pressure of air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL BOILERS.\r\n\r\nThe writer stated that his experience in the manufacture and working of\r\nsteel boilers was satisfactory. Many steel boilers of sizes varying from\r\nsix feet diameter to fourteen feet six inches diameter have left the\r\nworks at St. Peter's since 1877, when the first was made; and in no\r\ncase has there been a failure of a plate after being put into a boiler,\r\neither in the process of manufacture or in working at sea. The mode\r\nof working is as follows: For shell plates, from five-eighths inch\r\nto seven-eighths inch thick, to warm each to a dark red heat before\r\nrolling, having previously drilled a few holes to template for bolting\r\nthe strakes together; the longitudinal seams are usually lap joints\r\ntreble riveted, requiring the corners to be thinned, which is done after\r\nrolling. The furnace plates are generally welded two plates in length,\r\nand flanged to form Adamson rings, and at the back end to meet the tube\r\nplate; the back flame-box plates are flanged, also the tube plates and\r\nfront and back plates; and wherever work is put on to the plate it\r\nis annealed before going into the place. The rivet holes are drilled\r\nthroughout. In the putting together the longitudinal seams of the\r\nthicker plates of the shells, great care is always taken to set the\r\nupper and under plates for the lap to their proper angle before they\r\nare bolted together, a point generally overlooked by the practical\r\nboilersmith.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORROSION OF BOILERS.\r\n\r\nThe question of corrosion is one which is gradually being answered as\r\ntime goes on; and so far very satisfactorily for steel. Some steel\r\nboilers were examined a few weeks ago which were among the first made;\r\nand the superintending engineer reports: \"There is no sign of pitting\r\nor corrosion in any part of the boiler; the boilers are washed out very\r\ncarefully every voyage, and very carefully examined, and I cannot trace\r\nanything either leaking or eating away. No zinc is used, only care in\r\nwashing out, drying out, and managing the water.\" This is the evidence\r\nof an engineer with a large number of vessels in his charge. On the\r\nother hand, some of the most prominent Liverpool engineers always use\r\nzinc, and take care to apply it most strictly. The evidence of one\r\nof them is as follows: \"We always fix slabs of zinc to most boilers,\r\nexposing not less than a surface of one square foot for every twenty\r\nindicated horse-power, and distributed throughout the boiler. This zinc\r\nwe find to be in a state of oxide and crumbling away in about three\r\nmonths. We then renew the whole, and find this will last twelve months\r\nor more, when it is renewed again. Meanwhile we have no pitting and no\r\ncorrosion; but on the contrary, the interior surfaces appear to have\r\ntaken a coating of oxide of zinc all over, and we have no trouble with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE MARINE ENGINE MAY BE IMPROVED.\r\n\r\nThen the writer considered our present marine engine as to its\r\nefficiency and capability of further improvement. The weight of\r\nmachinery, water, and fuel carried for propelling ships has not had due\r\nattention in the general practice of engineers. By the best shipping\r\nauthorities the writer is assured that every ton of dead weight capacity\r\nis worth on an average £10 per annum as earning freight. Assuming,\r\ntherefore, the weight of the machinery and water of any ordinary vessel\r\nto be 300 tons, and that, by careful design and judicious use of\r\nmaterials, the engineer can reduce it by 100 tons, without increasing\r\nthe cost of working, he makes the vessel worth £1,000 per annum more to\r\nher owners. That there is much room for improvement in this direction is\r\nshown by the following statement, giving, for various classes of ships,\r\nthe average weight of machinery, including engines, boilers, water, and\r\nall fittings ready for sea, in pounds, per indicated horse power:\r\n\r\n                                       Lb. per I. H. P.\r\n\r\n  Merchant steamers.......................... 480\r\n  Royal Navy................................. 300\r\n  Engines specially designed for light draught\r\n    vessels...................................280\r\n  Royal Navy, Polyphemus class (given by Mr.\r\n    Wright).................................. 180\r\n  Modern locomotive.......................... 140\r\n  Torpedo vessels............................. 60\r\n\r\n  Ordinary marine boilers, including water... 196\r\n  Locomotive boilers, including water......... 60\r\n\r\nThe ordinary marine boiler, encumbered as it is by the regulations of\r\nthe Board of Trade and of Lloyds' Committee, does not admit of much\r\nreduction in the weight of material or of water carried when working.\r\nThe introduction of steel has reduced the weight by about one-tenth; but\r\nit will be the alteration of form to the locomotive, tubulous, or some\r\nother type, combined with some method of forced draught, to which we\r\nmust look for such reductions in weight of material and water as will be\r\nof any great commercial value. The engine may be reduced in weight by\r\nreducing its size, and this can only be done by increasing the number of\r\nrevolutions per minute.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been the practice to treat the propeller as dependent\r\nupon the size of engines, draught of water, and speed required. This\r\nprocess should be reversed. The propeller's diameter depends on the\r\ncolumn of water behind necessary to overcome the resistance in front of\r\nit due to the properties of the vessel. This fixed, the speed will then\r\nfix the number of revolutions, which will be found much greater than is\r\nusual in practice, and from this the size of the engines and boilers\r\nwill be determined. Great saving in weight can be effected by careful\r\ndesign and judicious selection and adaptation of materials, also by the\r\nsubstitution of trussed framing and a proper mode of securing the engine\r\nto the structure of the vessel, as worked out in H.M.S. Nelson, by Mr.\r\nA. C. Kirk, of Glasgow, and in the beautifully designed engines by Mr.\r\nThornycroft, in place of the massive cast-iron bedplates and columns of\r\nthe ordinary engines of commerce. The same may be said of the moving\r\nparts. In fine, the hull and engines should be as much as possible one\r\nstructure; rigidity in one place and elasticity in others are the\r\ncause of most of the accidents so costly to the ship-owner; under such\r\nconditions mass and solidity cease to be virtues, and the sooner their\r\nplace is taken by careful design, and the use of the smallest weight\r\nof material--of the very best kind for the purpose--consistent with\r\nthorough efficiency, the better for all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION OF FUEL IN MARINE ENGINES.\r\n\r\nComing to the question of the consumption of fuel, a considerable saving\r\nhas been effected in nine years, as shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n               Item.                       1872.       1881.\r\n\r\n  Working pressure, lb. per sq. in......... 52.5        77.4\r\n  Heating surface per I. H. P., sq. ft....   4.64        3.919\r\n  Piston speed, feet per min.............. 376         467\r\n  Coal burnt per I. H. P., lb..............  2.11        1.828\r\n\r\nThis shows a saving equal to 13.38 per cent, in quantity of fuel\r\nconsumed. Mr. Marshall then read a letter from Mr. Alfred Holt, of\r\nLiverpool, bearing on this subject, in which Mr. Holt spoke favorably of\r\nthe single-crank engine, and stated his belief that the compound system\r\nwould ere long be abandoned for the simple engine. He is endeavoring to\r\nfeel his way to using the steam in one cylinder only, and so far the\r\nresults have been encouraging, and he is now fitting a 2,200-ton vessel\r\non that system. He is also endeavoring to do without a crank shaft, the\r\nforward end of the screw shaft carrying an ordinary crank with overhung\r\npin. This experiment also promises satisfactorily. In his opinion the\r\ngreat improvement of the immediate future is to increase the steam\r\nproduction of our boilers. A ton weight of a locomotive boiler produces\r\nas much steam as six tons of an ordinary steamboat boiler.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt speaks of the coal account as one of the minor disbursements\r\nof a steamer. He does not give the ratio which coals bear to the total\r\ndisbursements, but from other reliable sources Mr. Marshall found that,\r\naccording to the direction of the voyage, it varies from 16 to\r\n20 percent.--or, say, an average of 18 per cent.--of the total\r\ndisbursements, in a vessel carrying a cargo of 2,500 tons. This will\r\nrepresent to-day about £3,000 per annum, and in 1872, at equal prices,\r\nthe cost would have been £3,750--showing a saving of £750, equal to a\r\ndividend of, say, 3 per cent. on the value of the ship. Again, the cost\r\nof coal per mile run for such a vessel, in 1872, would have been at\r\nleast 16½d.; to-day it does not exceed 13d.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVAPORATIVE EFFICIENCY OF MARINE BOILERS.\r\n\r\nThe marine boiler as now made is very efficient, but if the quantity of\r\nsteam used be considered in relation to the increased pressure, it will\r\nbe seen that the boiler of to-day is little if anymore efficient than\r\nthat of ten years ago. The present boiler has an evaporative efficiency\r\nof about 75 per cent., and cannot be much improved so long as air\r\nis supplied to the furnace by the natural draught. To increase the\r\nefficiency from 75 to 82.5 per cent. would require about double the\r\nheating surface, the weight of boiler and water being also doubled,\r\nwhile the gain would be only 10 per cent. Mr. Blechynden's formula, used\r\nin Mr. Marshall's works for weights of cylindrical marine boilers of the\r\nordinary type, and for pressures varying from 50 lb. to 150 lb., is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nW = (P + 15) (S + D² L) / C\r\n\r\nor W = 2S (P + 15) / C\r\n\r\nwhen S = D² L, which is a common proportion.\r\n\r\n  Here W = weight in tons.\r\n       P = working pressure as on gauge.\r\n       S = heating surface, in square feet.\r\n       D = diameter, in feet.\r\n       L = length, in feet.\r\n       C = a constant divisor, depending on the class of\r\n           riveting, etc. For boilers to Lloyds' rules,\r\n           and with iron shells having 75 per cent.\r\n           strength of solid plate, C = 13,200.\r\n\r\nThis formula, if correct--and it is almost strictly so--would give the\r\nrelative weight of boilers per sq. ft. of heating surface, for 105 lb.\r\nand 150 lb. total pressure, assuming we wish to increase the efficiency\r\n10 per cent, as follows:\r\n\r\nWeight at 105 lb. = 105 x 1 / C\r\n\r\nWeight at 150 lb. = 150 x 1.75 / C = 263 / C\r\n\r\nHence the ratio of weight = 263 / 105 = 2.5\r\n\r\nIn other words, the boiler with the higher efficiency would weigh two\r\nand a half times that with the lower efficiency. In the case of a vessel\r\nof 3,000 tons, with engines and boilers of 1,500 indicated horse power,\r\nthe introduction of locomotive boilers with forced draught would place\r\nat the disposal of the owner 150 tons of cargo space, representing\r\n£1,500 per annum in addition to the present earnings of such a vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE LOCOMOTIVE BOILERS.\r\n\r\nMr. Thornycroft has for some years used the locomotive form of boiler\r\nfor his steam launches, working them under an air pressure--produced\r\nby a fan discharging into a close stokehold--of from 1 in. to 6 in. of\r\nwater, as may be required. The experiments made gave an evaporation of\r\n7.61 lb. of water from 1 lb. of coal at 212° Fahr., with 2 in. of water\r\npressure, and 6.41 lb. with 6 in. of pressure. These results are low,\r\nbut it is to be remembered that the heating surface is necessarily\r\nsmall, in order to save weight, and the temperature of the funnel\r\nconsequently high, ranging from 1,073° at the first pressure, and 1,444°\r\nat the 6 in. With the ordinary proportions of locomotive practice the\r\nefficiency can be made equal to the best marine boiler when working\r\nunder the water pressure usual in locomotives, say from 3 in. to 4 in.,\r\nincluding funnel draught.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen to the lot of the writer to fit three vessels recently\r\nwith boilers worked under pressure in closed stokeholds. The results,\r\neven under unfavorable conditions, were very satisfactory. The pressure\r\nof air would be represented by 2 in. of water, and the indicated horse\r\npower given out by the engines was 2,800, as against 1,875 when working\r\nby natural draught, or exactly 50 per cent. gain in power developed.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall then proceeded to refute the arguments which may be urged\r\nagainst the use of the locomotive boiler at sea, and which we need not\r\nreproduce. Coming to the engines, Mr. Marshall said that the total\r\nworking pressure of to-day may be accepted as 105 lb., or equal to seven\r\natmospheres. If it were boldly accepted that eleven atmospheres, or 165\r\nlb., were to be the standard working pressure, the result would be a\r\ngain of 14.55 per cent., provided no counteracting influence came into\r\nplay. Of course, there are forces which war against the attainment of\r\nthe full extent of this advantage, viz., the greater condensation in the\r\ncylinders and loss in the receiver or passages.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the former, it may be questioned whether by steamjacketing\r\nthe high pressure cylinder, correctly proportioning the steam passages,\r\nand giving a due amount of compression in both cylinders, this may not\r\nbe reduced far below the generally received notion; and the latter cause\r\nof loss may be considerably reduced in its effect by a more carefully\r\nchosen cylinder ratio. The ratio usually adopted, between 3.5 and 4 to\r\n1, whether the pressure be 70 lb. or 90 lb., may well be questioned.\r\nWith a cylinder ratio of 2.95 to 1, the economic performance is very\r\ngood, and equal to any with the higher ratio. A lower cylinder ratio has\r\nanother advantage of considerable value, viz., that the working pressure\r\ncan be much reduced as the boilers get older, while by giving a greater\r\namount of steam the power may be maintained--at an extra cost of steam,\r\nof course, but not so great a cost as with higher ratios. The cut-off\r\nin the high-pressure cylinder usually takes place at about 0.6, and\r\nthe ratio of expansion has decided the ratio of cylinders. The use of\r\nseparate starting valves in both cylinders obviates that necessity.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of taking advantage of the higher economic\r\nproperties of greater pressures than hitherto used on board ship, are,\r\nit is submitted, not insuperable, and it would be to the interest of all\r\nthat they should be firmly and determinedly met. It may be accepted as\r\nan average result that the Woolf engine, as usually arranged, will use\r\n10 per cent. more steam than the receiver engine for the same power.\r\n\r\nOf the three-cylinder receiver type the data are insufficient to form a\r\ndefinite opinion upon; but so far the general working of the Arizona is\r\nstated to be as good, economically, as any of the two-cylinder receiver\r\nclass. The surface condenser remains as it was ten years ago, with\r\nscarcely a detail altered. In most engines it remains a portion of the\r\nframing, and as such adds greatly to the weight of the engine.\r\n\r\nIt is a question seriously worth consideration whether or no the surface\r\nof tubes can be reduced. The practice at present is to make the surface\r\none-half the boiler surface as a minimum, that is, equal to about 2\r\nsquare feet per indicated horse power. In practice, the writer has found\r\n1.4 square feet per indicated horse power to maintain a steady vacuum of\r\n27½ inches.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall has just completed six pairs of engines for three twin\r\nscrew ships, having steel shafts of 10 inches diameter, and has in each\r\ncase run the engines at 120 revolutions per minute, while indicating\r\n1,380 horse power from each pair for ten to fifteen hours without\r\nstopping; and in no case has a single bearing or crank pin warmed or\r\nhad water applied, the surfaces on examination being perfect. In these\r\nengines all working bolts, pins, and rods, except the piston and\r\nconnecting rods, are of steel, all rods in tension being loaded to 8,000\r\nlb. per square inch. The boilers are of the Navy type, made throughout\r\nof Siemens-Martin steel plates, riveted with steel rivets, all holes\r\ndrilled. Furnaces are welded and flanged; the tubes are of brass. In\r\ncomparison with an ordinary merchant steamer's iron boilers of the\r\ndouble ended type, they weigh, including water and all appurtenances, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                      Double ended Type.    Navy Type.\r\n\r\n  Weight, tons............   135 ...........  146\r\n  I. H. P................. 1,400 .......... 2,760\r\n  Draught................ Natural ......... Forced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREW PROPELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe screw propeller is still to a great extent an unsolved problem. We\r\nhave no definite rule by which we can fix the most important factor of\r\nthe whole, namely, the diameter. Mr. Froude has pointed out that by\r\nreducing the diameter, and thus the peripheral friction, we can increase\r\nthe efficiency; and this is confirmed by cases--of Iris reduced 2 feet\r\n3 inches, and the Arizona reduced 2 feet. This must, of course, be\r\nqualified by other considerations. The ship has by her form a definite\r\nresistance, and a certain speed is required; if the propeller be made\r\ntoo small in diameter, the ship will not be driven at the required\r\nspeed, except at serious loss in other directions. This question was too\r\nlarge and complicated to be dealt with here, and should, in the first\r\ninstance, be made the subject of careful and extended experiment, on\r\nwhich a separate paper should be written.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole. Progress has been made during the past nine years,\r\nand in the following particulars:\r\n\r\n1. The power of the engines made and making show a great increase. 2.\r\nSpeeds hitherto unattainable are now seen to be possible in vessels of\r\nall the various classes. 3. The consumption of fuel is reduced by 13.38\r\nper cent. on the average; and numbers of vessels are now working on much\r\nless coal than that average, while the quality of the coal is in nearly\r\nall cases very inferior, so that it is not unfair to take credit for\r\n20 per cent. reduction. 4. The working pressures of steam are much\r\nincreased on the average, and are still increasing; many steamers now\r\nbeing built for 120 lb. per square inch, while 90 lb. is the standard\r\npressure now required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE PORT OF MARSEILLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe small steam ferry boats represented in the accompanying cut are\r\ndoing service in the port of Marseilles, and the following description\r\nof them has been given by Mr. Flecher in the _Bulletin de la Société des\r\nAnciens Elèves d'Arts et Metiers_:\r\n\r\nAll those who are acquainted with the Old Port of Marseilles know the\r\ninconvenience of communication between one shore and the other, and the\r\nhigh price of ferriage by row boats. To obviate this, Captain Advient\r\nhas been struck with the happy idea of creating a cheap steam service\r\n(fare one cent), thus supplying a genuine want in the modes of\r\nlocomotion of the city.\r\n\r\nThe building of these ferry boats, on a system providing for the use of\r\nseparate hulls, was confided to Messrs. Stapfer, De Duclos & Co., of\r\nMarseilles, whose well-known reputation was a sufficient guarantee that\r\nthe problem would be successfully solved.\r\n\r\nThere existed difficulties of two natures: The first of these related to\r\nthe stability of boats such as this, having their engine, boiler, supply\r\nof coal, forty passengers who might all occupy one side of the vessel, a\r\ncentral superstructure, with roof; and, finally, all the weight centered\r\non five feet of the deck, with nothing below to counterbalance it except\r\nthe hollow hulls and two three-foot compartments, each placed toward the\r\ncentral portion of the hulls and designed as fresh-water reservoirs\r\nfor the steam generator. The second difficulty was to obtain the best\r\nutilization possible of a screw placed in the current between the hulls\r\nand upon a shaft inclined toward the stern, that is, \"stern\" by analogy,\r\nfor there is no distinction of fore and aft in ferry boats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAM FERRYBOATS OF THE PORT OF MARSEILLES.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the problem were finally fulfilled to the satisfaction\r\nof all concerned, and especially to that of the public.\r\n\r\nThe hulls, navicular in form and having a flat bottom, are constructed\r\nof one-tenth inch iron plate and 40x40 angle iron. Their dimensions\r\nare: Length, 33 feet; breadth, 3¼ feet; and depth, 5 feet. The internal\r\ndistance between the two shells is 7¼ feet. These hulls, having\r\nabsolutely water-tight decks, are connected below by tie bars of flat\r\niron, and above by vertical stays 1 foot in length, which serve to\r\nsupport the floor-planks of the deck and boilerplate flooring of the\r\nengine-room. The engine-room, which is 19½ feet long by 5 feet wide, is\r\nconstructed of varnished pitch-pine, with movable side-shutters of teak.\r\nThe roof, of thin iron plate, is provided with a ventilator to allow of\r\nthe escape of hot air.\r\n\r\nThe passengers, to the number of forty or fifty, can move about freely\r\nfrom larboard to starboard, or from stem to stern, or seat themselves\r\non the benches running along the inside of the guard railing on the two\r\nsides of the vessel. They are protected from rain by a roof, and from\r\nthe rays of the sun by a curtain extending along the sides.\r\n\r\nAlthough the usual method of landing is fore and aft, gangways have been\r\nprovided at the sides for side-landing should it become necessary.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of one of these boats may be likened to that of a\r\nfloating street-car. Finally, a small apartment, provided with benches,\r\nis provided for the use of those passengers who might be taken sick, or\r\nfor office purposes, if need be.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of one of the boats is divided up as follows:\r\n\r\n  Forty passengers................ 6,200 pounds,\r\n  Engine and boiler............... 6,600   \"\r\n  Ballast, water, and equipment... 9,900   \"\r\n  Deck and superstructure......... 6,600   \"\r\n  Hull and accessories............12,500   \"\r\n                                  ______\r\n\r\n  Total...........................41,800   \"\r\n\r\nor a displacement of about 700 cubic feet, corresponding to a maximum\r\ndraught of 3.7 feet. The mean speed is 4 knots, or 4½ miles per hour, a\r\ngreat velocity being unnecessary, owing to the small distance to cross\r\nin a port often obstructed by the general movement of vessels taking\r\nplace therein.\r\n\r\nThe engine is from 16 to 18 horse-power. Its frame is inclined\r\nperpendicularly to the direction of the screw-shaft, the extremity of\r\nwhich is supported near the screw by a strengthened cross-stay serving\r\nas a pillow-block. The cylinder is 8 inches in diameter, and the piston\r\nhas a stroke of 6 inches, causing the screw (which is 3¼ feet diameter)\r\nto make 200 revolutions per minute. The screw, although it has a wide\r\nsurface of thrust, gives, nevertheless, a recoil of about 30 per cent.,\r\nbecause of its location between the hulls and its oblique action on the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe steam is furnished by a tubular boiler having an internal fireplace\r\nand a heating surface of sixteen square meters, the draught being\r\neffected by the exhaust of the engine. This boiler, which is tested\r\nup to 14 pounds, is fed by a steam pump, or by a pump actuated by the\r\nengine. The feed pumps take water successively from one or the other of\r\nthe reservoirs in the hulls. The reservoirs are filled in the morning,\r\nand their level is ascertained by two small and ingenious Decondun\r\nindicators, the dials of which are placed against the walls of the\r\nengine-room.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, these little boats are well arranged and quite\r\nhandsome; and, since they were put into service in June, 1880, they have\r\nproved a great convenience to the hard-working and active population for\r\nwhich they were built.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF A NEW ENGLISH DOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July last, Admiral the Duke of Edinburgh, with the Naval Reserve\r\nSquadron under his command, arrived in the Firth of Forth and anchored\r\nin Leith Roads. His Royal Highness performed the ceremony of opening the\r\nnew dock at Leith, which has been named after him. The \"Edinburgh\" Dock\r\nat Leith, which was commenced in 1874, consists of a center basin 500\r\nft. long and 650 ft. wide, and two basins 1,000 ft. long and 200 ft.\r\nwide, separated by a jetty having a width of 250 ft. The total amount\r\nof masonry in the wet docks is 100,000 cubic yards. The north and south\r\nquays are each 1,500 ft. long, and the two sides of the jetty 1,000 ft.\r\nlong each, having a total quayage in connection with the dock of 6,775\r\nft. The walls are 15 ft. thick at the base, narrowing in two tiers to\r\n8 ft. The new dock will cost altogether about £300,000. Leith now\r\npossesses five docks and a total quayage of three miles 808 yards, 1,234\r\nyards of which is the old portion. These works have been constructed, at\r\na cost of nearly one million sterling, by the Leith Dock Commissioners,\r\nwhose chairman, Mr. James Currie, presented an address to the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, on board the flag-ship H.M.S. Hercules, giving an account of\r\ntheir affairs. The other docks at Leith are named the \"Old Dock,\" the\r\n\"Queen's Dock,\" the \"Victoria,\" the \"Albert,\" and the \"Prince of Wales\r\nDock.\" The opening ceremony was arranged to consist of the steamer\r\nBerlin, with his Royal Highness and the Dock Commissioners on board,\r\naccompanied by Sir Donald Currie, M.P., and other gentlemen, passing\r\nthrough the entrance from the Albert Dock to the new dock, across which\r\na blue ribbon had been stretched. At the moment when the ribbon snapped\r\nasunder, under the bow of the Berlin, the Duke of Edinburgh, stepping\r\nforward on the upper deck of the steamer, said, \"I have now the\r\ngratification of declaring this dock open, and calling it the Edinburgh\r\nDock.\" On this announcement being made, a signal was conveyed to a\r\nbattery of guns, posted on the sea wall of the new dock, from which a\r\nparty of the Royal Artillery fired a Royal salute. The steamer, having\r\ngone round the new dock, was brought up at the quay at the west. His\r\nRoyal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, with Prince Henry of Prussia, the\r\nofficers of the fleet, and the Commissioners, disembarked and proceeded\r\nto the saloon in the new dock, where luncheon in honor of the occasion\r\nwas given by the Leith Dock Commissioners.--_Illustrated London News,\r\nAug. 6._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPENING OF A NEW ENGLISH DOCK.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GRAIN ELEVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows the apparatus at work transferring a cargo of\r\ngrain from the hold of a ship by means of an elevating band fitted\r\nwith buckets. By a simple contrivance shown in the engraving by\r\ndiamond-shaped squares, the elevating band can be shortened or\r\nlengthened at pleasure, so as to suit it to the position the grain to be\r\nelevated occupies in the ship or barge. When the grain is elevated to\r\nthe point whence it is to be transferred to the granary, railway\r\ntruck, or other destination, the band travels horizontally on suitable\r\nbearings, the buckets being so constructed that in traveling they retain\r\ntheir load intact. The contrivance for lengthening and shortening the\r\nbucket band is an application of the \"lazytongs\" device, which is well\r\nknown. The float of the elevator is shown at the left hand of the\r\nengraving, and, as seen in the latter, there is an automatic weighing\r\nmachine, by which the material may be weighed as it is delivered, before\r\nit goes to the bottom of the elevator, to be again transferred by its\r\nmeans to the barge or granary. Simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability\r\nto any position in which elevators of this class are desirable, are the\r\nclaims the patentees, Messrs. Behrns & Unruth, Lubeck, make for the\r\nadvantages of their apparatus.--_London Miller_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED FLOATING ELEVATOR.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED DREDGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe illustrate below a useful type of dredger made by Messrs. Rennie, of\r\nBlackfriars, England. The drawing almost explains itself. The machine\r\nconsists of a double barge or pontoon, in which is erected a derrick.\r\nThis derrick works a \"spoon\" dredge at the end of a lever. The spoon, as\r\nshown, is at its lowest position. It will make a forward stroke, through\r\nabout one-sixth of a revolution, and will thus become filled with\r\nmud and be lifted above the surface of the water. The motion will be\r\nimparted to it by the chain and pulleys seen at outer end of the derrick\r\njib. The jib will then be swung round over the bank on a hopper barge\r\nand its contents delivered. The requisite power is supplied by the steam\r\nengine at the end of the pontoon. Messrs. Rennie have made several of\r\nthese little dredgers, which are found very useful and handy in shallow\r\nwater.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE BUCKET DIPPER DREDGER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY ALARM WHISTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent a train passing a danger signal during a fog or\r\nsnowstorm without being seen by the engineer, the Southern Railway\r\nCompany of France have attached to the locomotive a steam whistle, which\r\nis controlled by the signal. The whistle is connected with an insulated\r\nmetallic brush placed under the engine. Between the rails there is a\r\nprojecting contact bar, faced with copper, which is swept by the brush\r\nwhen the train passes. This contact piece is connected with the\r\npositive pole of a voltaic battery, the negative pole of which is in\r\ncommunication with a commutator on the signal post, from which a wire\r\nleads to the ground. When the signal is \"line clear\" the passage of the\r\nbrush over the fixed contact produces no result; but when the signal\r\nmarks \"danger,\" the commutator brings the negative pole of the battery\r\nin direct communication with the ground, and when the brush passes over\r\nthe contact the completion of the electric current causes the whistle to\r\nbe sounded, so as to alarm the driver.--_L'Ingen.

In laboratories, charcoal and roll\r\nbrimstone are employed so as to obtain as pure a product as possible;\r\nbut sulphide of carbon having now become so important a commercial\r\nproduct, and being employed for so large a number of industrial\r\npurposes, it has been found more economical to substitute coke for\r\ncharcoal and pyrites for brimstone.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Labois, in their system of furnace represented herewith,\r\nhave had in view the manufacture of this product under as economical\r\nconditions as possible, by coupling over two connected fireplaces the\r\nretort in which the pyrites is distilled, and that in which the reaction\r\nof the sulphur and carbon takes place.\r\n\r\nThe pyrites is fed from the hopper, A, into a distributing box, B,\r\nfurnished with a valve which is maneuvered by a lever. From thence it\r\ndescends into the retort, G, where it is roasted by the heat of the\r\nfireplace, L. The sulphur converted into a state of vapor passes through\r\nthe conduit, R, into the coke or charcoal retort, G', which is divided\r\ninto two parts by the partition, _g g'_, of refractory clay, and heated\r\nby the fireplace, L'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABOIS'S SULPHIDE OF CARBON FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nThe conduit, R', leads the sulphide of carbon in a state of vapor to the\r\ncondensing apparatus. The uncombined sulphur which is carried along is\r\ndeposited in the first part of the retort by the arrangement of the\r\npartition, which permits of passage only below. The registers, V and\r\nV', permit of the introduction of the sulphur vapor and the exit of the\r\nsulphide of carbon being regulated.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is so easy of installation that it may be applied without\r\nmuch expense to pyrites furnaces already in operation.\r\n\r\nWherever a manufactory of the product is to be started, the system\r\nrecommends itself by its simplicity, and by the facility with which the\r\noperation may be watched and conducted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROUARDEL'S DRY INSCRIBING MANOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrouardel's manometer, represented herewith, is designed for showing\r\ngraphically variations in the pressure of gas, either at the works\r\nduring the course of manufacture, or at any point whatever in the system\r\nof piping.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose water manometers have hitherto been employed; but,\r\nalthough the indications given by these are very accurate, their form\r\nand weight are such as to render them not easily transportable; and\r\nthen, again, considerable care is necessary in putting them in place.\r\n\r\nMr. Brouardel's registering manometer does not give so accurate\r\nindications, perhaps, but it possesses, as an offset, the merit of being\r\nvery portable and easily put in place; and, besides, it inscribes the\r\nhour at which the pressure is exerted.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a metallic cylinder, A B, which carries a\r\ncircular shoulder, C, that rests on a plate, D--the latter being put in\r\nmotion by a clock which is wound up by means of a button under the base,\r\nE, of the apparatus. The two standards, F F, carry a crosspiece which\r\nsupports a disk that closes freely the aperture of the drum, A B, in\r\nsuch a manner as not to impede its rotation.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the cylinder there is a metallic cup which is\r\nconnected with the central reservoir by an impermeable membrane, I.\r\nThese three parts form a closed chamber, into which the pressure comes\r\nthrough a tube, F, provided with a cock. A spring, M, which counteracts\r\nthe pressure, is arranged between the crosspiece, G, and the bottom of\r\nthe reservoir. The latter carries also a small rod, K, which is provided\r\nwith a cord made of braided silk. This cord runs over a pulley, N, whose\r\naxle carries at its other end a still larger pulley, O. Toward the\r\nmiddle of the latter is fixed a silken cord which hangs down on each\r\nside, after making several turns around the pulley. To the front cord\r\nis attached a slide, Q, moving in a vertical direction, and to which is\r\nfixed an inscribing style, R. The other extremity of the thread enters\r\nthe hollow upright, and carries a weight which is greater than the\r\ncombined weights of the slide, the membrane, and the internal reservoir.\r\nThe upright serves as a guide to this counterpoise.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the apparatus there is affixed to the cylinder, A B, a\r\nsheet of paper divided in a vertical direction into as many parts as\r\nthe cylinder takes hours to make one revolution. The divisions running\r\nhorizontally represent centimeters of water or of mercury, according to\r\nthe strength of the spring, M, which should be so constructed as to be\r\nin relation with the pressure. The operation of the apparatus may be\r\nreadily understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS INDICATOR OF MANOMETER.]\r\n\r\nWhen the gas reaches the pressure chamber, the spring, M, contracts, and\r\nconsequently the counterpoise descends, and causes the cord, O, which\r\ncarries the slide and writing style, to wind around the pulley. When the\r\npressure diminishes, the movement takes place in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe tracing is done by means of a special form of style giving indelible\r\ncurves through the medium of colored glycerine. The position of the\r\npoint is determined in such a way as to annul the friction of the pen,\r\nand consequently to give it greater sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that the course of the rod, K, is amplified in the\r\ntracing of the ordinates of the pressure according to the ratio of the\r\ndiameters of the pulleys, N and O.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus may be carried by hand by means of the handle, S, either\r\nin or out of its case. To put it in operation, it is only necessary to\r\nconnect the apparatus with a gas burner (located near the place where\r\nthe variations of pressure are to be observed) by means of rubber\r\ntubing. The apparatus may be employed under the same circumstances as\r\nglass and U-shaped water manometers, with the further advantage that the\r\nresults are registered, and consequently can be more easily compared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRIFUGAL APPARATUS FOR CASTING METALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus represented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 is the invention of\r\nMessrs. Taylor & Wailes, and is designed for casting metallic objects\r\nin annular form, its arrangement being slightly varied according to the\r\nnature of the objects to be cast. In all cases where a special form is\r\nto be given to the outer or inner circumference of the object, or where\r\nit is desired to exert a pressure on the circumference, such form or\r\npressure is obtained by the introduction of a core which may be expanded\r\nor contracted as need may be. For this purpose an expansible, metallic\r\ncore is employed, the arrangement of which is shown in Figs. 1 and 2,\r\nand which is so fashioned that the inner circumference of the ring to be\r\ncast may receive the desired form. This core is formed of the pieces, g,\r\ng', made of cast-iron or any other material which fuses with difficulty,\r\nand which are placed in the revolving mould in such a way that after the\r\ncooling of the pieces the parts, g, recede by the shrinkage of the piece\r\nand thus free the core. The parts, g, of the core are in the shape of\r\ncircular segments, and are united at their external circumference by a\r\nflange, along with which they form a shoulder piece for the casting.\r\nAs a consequence of the rapid revolution of the mould, these parts are\r\npressed by centrifugal force against the molten metal which is run into\r\nthe mould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRIFUGAL METAL MOULDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe plan, Fig. 2, shows the arrangement of the parts, g, g', and allows\r\nit to be seen that the pieces, g', act as wedges against the segments,\r\ng, and push these out so as to form a perfect circle. The molten metal\r\ncannot become oxidized in the mould, since it is shut off from contact\r\nwith the external air by the cap, C, which covers it. Oxidation may,\r\nhowever, be further prevented by passing some deoxidizing or neutral gas\r\ninto the mould. For this purpose the mould is filled before the casting\r\nis done with some such gas as illuminating gas, carbonic acid, nitrogen,\r\nor hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThis improved process of casting may also be employed for objects which\r\ndo not possess an exactly annular section. The moulds are then arranged\r\neccentrically in a frame which is made to revolve rapidly during the\r\ncooling of the metal In this way the pieces are less strongly compressed\r\nat the places where they are nearest the center of rotation than a the\r\npoints where the radius is greater.\r\n\r\nFigs. 3 and 4 show section and plan of an apparatus of this kind. The\r\nsand moulds are arranged in the frame, a b which revolves about the\r\naxle, c. In the moulds there are iron cores, h, which press the metal\r\nduring rotation and thereby produce compact pieces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOD PULP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor manufacturing wood pulp Mr. Dresel employs an apparatus such as\r\nrepresented in Figs. 1 and 2, consisting of an upright cylindrical\r\nreservoir, A, supported on a frame by means of trunnions, z. This\r\nreservoir, which is of boiler plate, is furnished with a cover, D, which\r\nhas in its center a piece of tubing, with stop-cock, C. A series of\r\ntubes, R, whose diameter and length are proportioned to the volume of\r\nthe boiler, A, is filled with the liquid which is contained in the\r\nboiler, so as always to be able to rapidly produce a pressure of nine\r\natmospheres or more by direct heating. The flanges of the tubing are\r\nprovided with a cut-off of angle iron identical with that of the tube,\r\nD. By means of this arrangement the cocks and the flanges, E, permit of\r\ncommunication between the serpentine tubing, R, and the boiler being\r\ninterrupted; while the heat developed by the fire-place, F, causes an\r\nactive circulation in both the tubing and boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRESEL'S WOOD PULP APPARATUS. Fig. 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRESEL'S WOOD PULP APPARATUS. Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nTo put the apparatus in operation the cover, D, is first unscrewed, and\r\nthere is put into the boiler a certain quantity of wood, which has been\r\ndivided up by a cutting machine of special form. Then the boiler is\r\nfilled to the proper height with the liquid necessary to dissolve the\r\nincrusting materials, the cocks, B, being closed. Afterwards there\r\nis fixed immediately beneath the angle-iron ring of the cover, D, a\r\nperforated iron plate upon which the contents of the boiler rest when\r\nthe latter is turned up. Then the cover is fastened down and the boiler\r\nis put in communication with the heating apparatus. The cocks, E and B,\r\nare opened, so that the liquid may begin its movement in the tube, a,\r\nthe boiler, A, and the tube, n. As soon as the proper temperature\r\nis reached for converting the wood into fiber and decomposing the\r\nincrusting matters, the heat is shut off in case the tubing, R, is not\r\nconnected with another like boiler, and, after closing the cocks, E and\r\nB, and shut off communication between the tubing and the boiler, the\r\nlatter is turned over and the cock, C, gradually opened in order to\r\nallow the steam to escape. When the temperature has descended to 100°\r\nin the boiler the cover, D, may be opened, after the liquid has been\r\nallowed to flow out through the cock, C. Next, lixiviation is effected\r\nby connecting the cock, C, with the steam pipe, P, and causing steam\r\nunder pressure to enter the boiler, A. The action of the steam on the\r\ncontents of the latter, which are now converted into cellulose, mixed\r\nwith a large quantity of dissolved matters and of liquid, effects a\r\ncomplete washing and permits of the recovery of considerable quantities\r\nof useful chemical products. Moreover, the steam purifies, decolorizes,\r\nand completely separates the fibers, and renders them more easily\r\nsusceptible of being bleached. Finally, the perforated bottom, S (which\r\nis formed of two parts), is removed and the boiler emptied.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the operations under control, and for the purpose of\r\nsafety, there is riveted into the boiler, A, a tube, T, containing a\r\nthermometer: and there is fixed to the tube, a, a pressure-gauge, M, and\r\na safety-valve. The level of the liquid is ascertained by means of a\r\ngauge-cock, H.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT PROGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirty-fourth annual summer meeting of the Institution of Mechanical\r\nEngineers began on Aug. 2, at Newcastle-on-Tyne. The following is an\r\nabstract from the address of the president, Mr. E. A. Cowper.\r\n\r\nHe began by stating that as members of the Institution of Mechanical\r\nEngineers, on revisiting their brother members and friends here in\r\nNewcastle, after an interval of twelve years, they came as it were to\r\none of their natural homes; certainly to the home of one of the greatest\r\nengineers that England has ever produced, and the birthplace of the\r\nlocomotive, which has done more than any other improvement, of our age\r\nto lessen the cost of materials to the men who have to use them, and\r\ntherefore to cheapen and extend production in the most wonderful manner.\r\nHe then went on to say that it seems but a few years ago since George\r\nStephenson, at a meeting in 1847, proposed the resolution that the\r\nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers be formed. He was strongly supported\r\nby a large number of the mechanical engineers of the country, and the\r\nspeaker had the honor of seconding the resolution that he be first\r\npresident. The intention was that engineers from all parts of the\r\ncountry should join to form a compact body capable of discussing\r\nand judging of all mechanical subjects and appliances. In this the\r\ninstitution had been eminently successful, and it numbered among its\r\nmembers mechanical engineers in every large town in the country, and has\r\nincreased in strength and importance.\r\n\r\nThe last twelve years have been marked by many very important\r\nchanges, while low prices have generally ruled. Among other causes of\r\nfluctuations in demand and supply (and consequently in values) must be\r\nmentioned the occurrence and the threatening of foreign wars, which\r\ndisturbed the course of commerce greatly for some years. Such causes\r\nmust be considered as extraneous to the sphere of influence possessed by\r\ngood or bad manufacturing or engineering. Mr. Cowper does not look upon\r\nthe very great expense of improved war material and implements as an\r\nunmixed evil for this country; for it so happens that we can better meet\r\nsuch outlay than any other nation, and thus our wealth gives rise to\r\ngreater power and security than our neighbors possess; while, seeing\r\nthat we are not an aggressive nation, such power tends materially at\r\nonce to the progress of this country, and to the peace of the world.\r\nHaving referred briefly to one cause of disturbance to the progress of\r\nmechanical engineering, he named another, which at the present moment is\r\noccupying thoughtful men to a considerable extent, namely, the arbitrary\r\nimposition of duties and bounties for the professed object of protecting\r\nmanufactures, while in fact they constitute taxes on a nation for the\r\nbenefit of a few individuals. In some countries excessive duties have\r\nbeen imposed, as against our manufactures, and it is even proposed to\r\nincrease them; while in other cases bounties are actually paid out of\r\nthe public purse to men engaged in a particular manufacture, on their\r\nexporting to this county certain of their wares, as, for instance,\r\nbeet-root sugar.\r\n\r\nOne extremely significant lesson, resulting from high duties--which it\r\nmay be hoped will not be thrown away upon the American public--is, that\r\nwhereas our cousins on the other side of the water used to build almost\r\nall the American \"liners\" of wood, they now find that, with their\r\nexcessive duties against the importation of iron and steel from England,\r\nthey cannot compete with English iron and steel ship-builders and marine\r\nengineers. This is one of those damaging effects naturally produced\r\nby excessive protective duties; which, while they enable American\r\nironmasters quickly to realize enormous fortunes, drive the American\r\nmerchants to purchase English ships, or intrust their merchandise in\r\nEnglish bottoms, as it is impossible to maintain protective duties at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWhatever fluctuations have occurred, it is now pretty clear that\r\nseveral foreign nations have settled down to cultivate and extend their\r\nmanufactures, and we are brought face to face with the fact--which has\r\nnow been for some years growing to its present importance--that many\r\narticles which in years gone by we thought it to be our especial\r\nprovince to supply, are now produced in the very countries requiring\r\nthem. Even Spain is awakening to the advantage of producing hematite\r\niron from her own excellent ores, with English and Welsh coke carried\r\nout in the same ships that bring Spanish ores to this country.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the possibility of any foreign nation eclipsing us in\r\nour manufactures, he would say at once that any such successful rivalry\r\non their part is far worse than the effect of any duties, even if they\r\nbe prohibitive; for it means rivalry in the markets of the world, and\r\npossibly in our own markets here at home. Therefore it behooves us\r\nto put our house in order, and see in what way we may be enabled to\r\nmanufacture better and with greater economy. Mechanical engineering is\r\nof such extreme importance in advancing civilization, that it is most\r\nessential that its progress should be rapid and unimpeded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very large increase in steam shipping, and the change from\r\nsailing ships and paddle steamers to screw steamers, has been one of the\r\ngreatest improvements of recent times, and it is none the less real\r\nor important from having been gradual, while the result to this\r\nneighborhood has been most beneficial. This change has been due in great\r\nmeasure to the introduction of very economical marine engines, chiefly\r\nof the compound type, together with better boilers carrying a higher\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe speed and regularity of ocean steamers has also greatly improved,\r\nand one small scientific improvement has added much to the safety of\r\ntraversing such seas as the Atlantic at a high speed--namely, the\r\ncareful and continual use of a good thermometer, to ascertain constantly\r\nthe temperature of the sea-water at the surface. For if an iceberg is\r\nfloating within a quarter of a mile--or even half a mile, if the sea is\r\npretty smooth--the surface water will be several degrees colder than the\r\nrest of the sea; since the very cold fresh water, resulting from the\r\nmelting iceberg, floats on the top of the sea water for some distance.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the use of iron, and now of steel, has contributed most largely\r\nto the increase of shipbuilding in this country. Good arrangements\r\nof water ballast have also proved very useful; and steam cranes and\r\narrangements for loading and discharging cargo have greatly promoted the\r\nuse of steam colliers, enabling them to make more voyages in the year.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with marine engineering is the great improvement in\r\nthe economy of stationary engines, which has become more fully developed\r\nduring recent years, both in reference to waterworks engines and factory\r\nengines. In aid of stationary engines, \"surface evaporator condensers\"\r\nhave been found very useful, particularly where the supply of water is\r\nvery limited; and at waterworks it is now very common to pass the whole\r\nwater pumped through a surface condenser, thus giving a good vacuum\r\nwithout the expenditure of any water, and with the result of only\r\nraising the temperature of the water a very few degrees, on account of\r\nits large volume.\r\n\r\nLocomotives have shared to some extent in the general improvement in\r\nmachinery. The boilers are better made, and are safer at the higher\r\npressures now carried than they were formerly with a low pressure.\r\nSeveral new valve gears of great promise have been brought forward, both\r\nfor locomotives and marine engines. Among them Joy's motion should be\r\nagain noticed. Mr. Webb says: \"The engine shown at Barrow has been at\r\ncontinuous work ever since the Barrow meeting, and has run 30,278 miles;\r\nwe had it in for examination on the 18th inst., and found the motion\r\npractically as good as the day it went out of the shop, more especially\r\nthe slides, about which so many of the people who spoke at the meeting\r\nseemed to have doubts. I do not think you could get a visiting card\r\nbetween the slides and the blocks; in fact, the engine has been sent out\r\nto work again, having had nothing whatever done to it. The first thing,\r\nof course, that will require doing will be the tires; as far as I can\r\nsee nothing else will want doing for some time.\"\r\n\r\nA very fine engineering work has now been accomplished in America in\r\nreference to navigation, namely, the deepening of the channel at the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi through the training of the river by jetties\r\nand banks. In consequence, ships of large size may now go up the\r\nriver--there being plenty of deep water above the mouth--and bring down\r\ngrain cargoes, without the expense and inconvenience of transshipment,\r\nthus reducing the freight of corn to this country. This great\r\nimprovement is the work of Captain Eads. A somewhat similar improvement\r\nwas the blowing up of about 50,000 tons of rock from the bed of the\r\nriver at the narrow pass of Hell Gate, near New York. It is to be hoped\r\nthat these good examples may spur on our friends on the Continent to\r\nimprove their harbors, so that large channel boats may cross with\r\ncomfort to the passengers, thus avoiding the excessive expense that a\r\ntunnel would involve.\r\n\r\nGreat improvements have been made in the illumination of lighthouses\r\nby oil lamps; a light equal to 1,300 candles has been produced by Mr.\r\nDouglass, of the Trinity House, and now two such lights will be placed\r\none above the other, where required. The electric light has made such\r\nnumerous and rapid strides that it is impossible even to notice its\r\nvarious applications; but on the one hand the lighting by Dr. Siemens\r\nof four miles of dock frontage at the Albert Dock of the London and St.\r\nKatherine Dock Company, together with the railway behind the warehouses,\r\nand the warehouses and ships themselves, and, on the other hand, the\r\nelegant and steady domestic light of Mr. Swan, are excellent examples\r\nof the two extremes in this department. I believe we shall have the\r\npleasure of closely observing the Swan light during our visit here. The\r\nlighthouse electric light is also a noble application of the great power\r\nof a single electric light on the arc principle. The most powerful\r\nelectric light in the world is situated near here on the coast, between\r\nthe Tyne and the Wear. It is possible, and even probable, that one of\r\nthe great uses to which electric force will be applied eventually, will\r\nbe simple conveyance of power by means of large wires; and as a higher\r\npercentage of power is gradually being realized, this method will become\r\nmore economical. I may mention that 60 per cent. has already been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe invention of Messrs. Thomas & Gilchrist, by which a very large field\r\nof ironstone is now, for the first time, made available for the purpose\r\nof making good steel by the Bessemer process, bids fair to make very\r\nconsiderable alterations in the steel-making trade, and in the hands\r\nof Mr. E. Windsor Richards it has been made a great success, while in\r\nGermany there are several works also using the process largely. Mild\r\nsteel is now being used to a great extent for the construction of steam\r\nboilers as well as of ships, and in steel castings for a variety of\r\npurposes, such as spur wheels, frames of portable engines, manhole door\r\nframes, etc., etc. Among the uses to which steel may be put is the\r\nmanufacture of steel sleepers in place of wood. It is a very encouraging\r\nfact that there are now, or rather there were already, at Dusseldorf, in\r\n1880, 70,000 tons of iron or steel railway sleepers in use in Germany.\r\nMr. Webb, of Crewe, has exhibited a very promising arrangement of\r\nsleepers and fastenings, to be made either of iron or steel. Steel\r\nsleepers should also be used for tramways.\r\n\r\nIf, now, some clever ironmaster could only accomplish the task of making\r\na good \"street pavement\" of cast iron, the increased demand for pig\r\nmetal would be enormous. It has nearly been accomplished already, by\r\nseveral different modes of construction; and there are very many streets\r\nwhere the luxury of wood pavement, which wears very rapidly, cannot be\r\nafforded, and where macadamizing will not stand the wear and tear of the\r\nheavy traffic. The use of ingot steel, or very mild steel, for making\r\ntin-plates is now an established thing, and manufacturers are now taking\r\nthis metal for making large tinned sheets up to seven by three feet.\r\n\r\nThe making of casks by machinery, cheaper and better than those made by\r\nhand, is now an accomplished fact by Mr. Ransome's machines. There are\r\ntwelve factories already established abroad, some turning out 2,000 or\r\n3,000 casks a week. This is a good case of English invention taking the\r\nlead in a manufacture.\r\n\r\nAmong good mechanical appliances that have been proved to be highly\r\nvaluable to the civil engineer may be mentioned the excavating machine,\r\nwhich answers well for certain soils and situations, though not for all;\r\nand the dredger of Messrs. Bruce & Batho, for excavating from the inside\r\nof piers in water.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing chemistry, which, with its numerous mechanical\r\nappliances, is much indebted to mechanical science and engineering,\r\ngreat advances have been made during the last dozen or twenty years.\r\nAluminum has been brought into practical use to a large extent, it\r\nbeing at once a very light metal and a very cleanly one. \"Anthracine,\"\r\nobtained from coal tar, has been manufactured largely for the purpose of\r\nproducing the various brilliant dyes now so common.\r\n\r\nNew materials for making candles have been manufactured, in some cases\r\nby purely mechanical means, such as boiling together for some hours, at\r\na pressure of several hundred pounds per square inch, neutral grease and\r\nwater, when the water takes up the base, viz., glycerine, and leaves\r\nthe grease as an acid grease. This same effect has been noticed in some\r\nsteam boilers, where the same water, without admixture of fresh, has\r\nbeen used over and over again with surface condensers. Then, again,\r\nlarge rotating chemical furnaces have been introduced; and improved\r\nglass furnaces--particularly tank glass furnaces, in which the batch is\r\nput in at one end, and the working holes are toward the other end--have\r\ncheapened the actual production of glass, and are being worked largely\r\non the Continent, and to some extent in this neighborhood. Toughened\r\nglass has made some progress for certain purposes. Besides the improved\r\nand extended use of glass in lighthouse illumination, it has again\r\nbeen pressed into our service for other purposes, through our greatly\r\nextended knowledge of the laws of optics.\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis has become of practical use, and photographs of the\r\nvarious Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum have been taken as permanent\r\nrecords of each experiment. That such extended knowledge should have\r\nbeen developed by that one little instrument, the lens, is but natural;\r\nfor the lens is at once the means by which we discover the extreme\r\nmagnitude of some portion of the infinite works of the Almighty in the\r\narchitecture of the heavens, and by which we appreciate to some extent\r\nthe extremely minute markings of a diatom that one cannot see with the\r\nnaked eye. At the same time we feel sure that there are other markings\r\nstill smaller, as every increase in the power of the microscope has\r\nalways rendered visible some markings still smaller than the last;\r\nand in like manner has every increase in the power of the telescope\r\ndeveloped more worlds and suns far away from our system and beyond our\r\nMilky Way. An approach to the infinite in minuteness and to the infinite\r\nin magnitude and distance is thus furnished to us by one instrument\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThere was but one further observation that he would venture to make, and\r\nit is this.\r\n\r\nWhen one looks back upon the goodly list of clever men and benefactors\r\nof the human race, who have lived, say, during the last hundred years,\r\none is sometimes tempted to wish that more of those scientific men, who\r\nhave had the most brilliant ideas, and been our greatest discoverers,\r\nshould have striven to carry out their discoveries into practice. For\r\ninstance, take Faraday's beautiful discoveries in electricity. It was,\r\nin a manner, left to Sir Francis Ronalds, Professor Daniell, Professor\r\nWheatstone, Fothergill Cooke, Dr. Siemens, and others, to develop from\r\nthose discoveries the \"intelligence wires,\" and \"bands,\" that now\r\nencircle the earth, and unite nations, and do so much to prevent\r\nmisunderstandings.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that the engineering profession has not been\r\nforgotten when honors have been conferred on distinguished men; and\r\namong others may be named Sir William Fairbairn, Sir John Rennie, Sir\r\nPeter Fairbairn, Sir Charles Fox, Sir William Armstrong, Sir Joseph\r\nWhitworth, Sir John Hawkshaw, Sir John Coode, Sir William Thomson, Sir\r\nJoseph Bazalgette, Sir Charles Hartley, Sir Charles Bright, Sir James\r\nRamsden, Sir John Anderson, Sir George Elliot, Sir Daniel Gooch, Sir\r\nHenry Tyler, Sir Samuel Canning, Sir Edward Reed, and Sir Frederick\r\nBramwell. With many noble examples before us, and with signs of an\r\nimprovement in many branches of commerce, he trusted that the latter\r\npart of the present century will, with somewhat greater exertion of\r\nthought and enterprise on our parts, be marked, not only by numerous\r\nsmall improvements, but by many substantial inventions for the good of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOBOKEN DRAINAGE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur thriving neighbor, Hoboken, just across the Hudson River, has a\r\nlarge and vitally important problem to solve. Of the 720 acres within\r\nthe city limits, 270 acres lie at a considerable height above the river\r\nand constitute what are known as the knoll or uplands of Hoboken.\r\nBetween this low ridge and Palisade Ridge lie 450 acres of marsh lands\r\nor meadows, 140 acres of which have already been built upon. The marsh\r\nis about half a mile wide, and something like a mile and a half long,\r\nextending southward into Jersey City. The surface is a network of matted\r\nvegetation and roots perhaps five feet deep, and under that lies a mass\r\nof blue clay or river silt 100 feet or more in depth. The original\r\ntidal flow over these marsh lands has been obstructed by viaducts for\r\nrailroads and streets, leaving only two natural outlets, a sluice way at\r\nFifteenth street on the north, and on the south a basin constructed by\r\nthe D. L. & W. R. R., 100 feet wide, and 2,300 feet long. The average\r\nlevel of the marsh land is three feet above mean low water and a foot\r\nand a half below mean high water. In the part built upon the streets are\r\nbut two feet above mean high water.\r\n\r\nDuring long easterly and northerly storms, especially at times of high\r\nspring tides, the level of the water in the Hudson is often such as to\r\ncover the meadows even at low tide; and on several occasions the water\r\nat high tide has been 4½ feet above the level of the meadows, and a foot\r\nor more above the established grade of the streets.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to drain these marsh lands so as to make them properly\r\nhabitable and to protect them from invasion by high tides and storm\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThe first drainage map of the district was made about fifteen years ago;\r\nsince then over $100,000 have been expended on tidal sewers and other\r\ndevices, and several acts have been passed by the New Jersey Legislature\r\nin furtherance of the work. An extended review of the plans proposed\r\nand the experiments made thus far is given in a report presented to the\r\nBoard of Health and Vital Statistics, last May, by Engineers Spielmann\r\nand Brush. Ten years ago Mr. Arthur Spielmann, on being directed by the\r\nCity Council to prepare plans and estimates for a contemplated sewer in\r\nFerry street to the western boundary of the city, reported adversely\r\nto the project, believing that such a sewer would fail to answer the\r\npurpose of its construction.\r\n\r\nThere were but two ways, he thought, of securing the end desired: First,\r\nby raising the grade sufficient to give a good drainage; second, by\r\nmaking reservoirs and forcing the drainage matter out into the river by\r\nsteam pumps. The first method he found impracticable on account of the\r\ncost of filling in so large an area and of raising the large number of\r\nhouses already on the low ground. The second plan was recommended as\r\nbeing much cheaper and entirely practicable. Substantially the same\r\nposition is taken in the report of last May, wherein it is alleged that\r\nthe superior economy of a pumping system has been sufficiently attested\r\nby several eminent hydraulic engineers who have since investigated the\r\nproblems involved. On a small scale the efficacy of the pumping system\r\nhas been practically tested, first, in Meadow street, between Ferry and\r\nFirst streets, and more recently in the southern part of the city, where\r\na number of property owners have kept twenty-five acres free from water\r\n(except during storms) by means of a private pump.\r\n\r\nThe comparative economy of the pumping system is shown by estimates\r\nin detail of the cost of constructing and operating such a system in\r\ncontrast with, the cost of raising the grade and introducing tidal\r\nsewers. Under both systems the cost of the ordinary sewers will be\r\nabout the same. A proper system of tidal sewers, it is claimed, will\r\nnecessitate the raising of the grade of the streets on the low lands\r\nto a height at least ten feet above mean high water. The extra cost of\r\nraising the streets is estimated at $3,000,000. The cost of the pumping\r\nsystem, with machinery and power sufficient to remove all storm water\r\nand sewage, is put at $150,000, while the running expenses, including\r\ninterest on the first outlay, are put at $30,000 a year. The interest on\r\nthe preliminary expenditure of the first plan considered is $180,000 a\r\nyear, or six times as much as the pumping system would involve.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimates made by Engineer Kirkwood, in his report\r\nof 1874, a total pumping capacity of 134,500,000 gallons a day will\r\nultimately have to be provided to meet the requirements during the\r\nheaviest storms, besides some six or seven million gallons a day of\r\nsewage proper, exclusive of storm waters. Not more than half that amount\r\nof pumping will be required at first, the increase to be made gradually\r\nas the marsh land is built upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS' HOMES--No. 14--\"BENT'S BROOK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur plate illustrates the residence of Mr. J. E. Boehm, A.R.A., the\r\nsculptor. Bent's Brook is situated at Holmwood, not far south of\r\nDorking, on the Mid-Sussex line, and commands some fine views of\r\nwell-timbered country. The site itself is comparatively low, and the\r\nsoil being clay it was advisable to keep the building well out of the\r\nground, and in this way a rather unusually high elevation for such\r\na house was obtained. The plan is very compactly arranged, with an\r\ningenious approach to the well-centered hall and staircase, over\r\nwhich, by a mezzanine contrivance, a good store place is secured. The\r\ndrawing-room has a belvedere bay, reached from the garden by an external\r\nstair, under which is a covered garden seat. A balcony overlooking the\r\ngarden leads also from the drawing-room, and a billiard room is arranged\r\non the basement level with a separate entrance from the porch. A\r\ntradesmen's entrance is provided elsewhere. The kitchen and offices are\r\non the lower floor level, and a kitchen yard is conveniently placed at\r\nthe rear. Red brick, with cut-brick dressings, is the material used\r\nthroughout for the walls, the upper parts of which are hung with\r\nornamental tiles. The gables are enriched with wide, massive barge\r\nboards, and the roof is surmounted with a white wooden cupola over the\r\nprincipal staircase. The terracotta panels along the entrance front,\r\nover the principal floor windows, were designed by Mr. Boehm himself.\r\nThe work was executed by Mr. H. Batchelor, builder, of Betchworth, and\r\nthe architect of the house was Mr. R. W. Edis, F.S.A., who superintended\r\nits erection.--_Building News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTISTS' HOMES No. 14 \"BENT'S BROOK.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SOME RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN LEAD PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Lately read before the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.]\r\n\r\nBy NORMAN C. COOKSON, of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author began by stating that probably in few trades have a smaller\r\nnumber of changes been made during recent years, in the processes\r\nemployed, than in that of lead smelting and manufacturing. He then\r\nbriefly noted what these changes are, and went on to describe the \"steam\r\ndesilverizing process,\" as used in the works of the writer's firm, and\r\nin other works licensed by them, which process is the invention of\r\nMessrs. Luce Fils et Rozan, of Marseilles. It is one which should\r\ncommend itself especially to engineers, as in it mechanical means\r\nare employed, instead of the large amount of hand-labor used in the\r\nPattinson process. It consists in using two pots only, of which the\r\nlower is placed at such a height that the bottom of it is about 12\r\nin. to 15 in. above the floor level, while the upper is placed at a\r\nsufficiently high level to enable the lead to be run out of it into\r\nthe lower pot. The capacity of the lower pot, in those most recently\r\nerected, is thirty-six tons--double that of the upper one. Round each\r\npot is placed a platform, on which the workmen--of which there are two\r\nonly to each apparatus--stand when skimming, slicing, and charging the\r\npots. The upper pot is open at the top, but the lower one has a cover,\r\nwith hinged doors; and from the top of the cover a funnel is carried\r\nto a set of condensers. At a convenient distance from the two pots is\r\nplaced a steam or hydraulic crane, so arranged that it can plumb each\r\npot, and also the large moulds which are placed at either side of the\r\nlower pot. The mode of working is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe silver lead is charged into the upper pot by means of the crane.\r\nWhen melted, the dross is removed, and the lead run into the lower, or\r\nworking pot, among the crystals remaining from a previous operation.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole charge is thoroughly melted, it is again drossed; and in\r\norder to keep the lead in a thoroughly uniform condition, and prevent it\r\nsetting solid on the top and the outside, a jet of steam is introduced.\r\n\r\nTo enable this steam to rise regularly in the working pot, a disk-plate\r\nis placed above the nozzle, which acts as a baffle-plate; and uniform\r\ndistribution of the steam is the result. To quicken the formation of\r\ncrystals, and thus hasten the operation, small jets of water are allowed\r\nto play on the surface of the lead.\r\n\r\nThis, it might be thought, would make the lead set hard on the surface;\r\nbut the violent action of the steam acts in the most effectual manner\r\nin causing the regular formation of crystals. Owing to the ebullition\r\ncaused by this action of the steam, small quantities of lead are forced\r\nup, and set on the upper edges and cover of the pot. From time to time\r\nthe valve controlling the thin stream of water playing on the top of the\r\ncharge is closed, and the workman, opening the doors of the cover in\r\nrotation, breaks off this solidified lead, which falls among the rest of\r\nthe charge, and instantly becomes uniformly mixed with it.\r\n\r\nVery little practice enables an ordinary workman to judge when\r\ntwo-thirds of the contents of the big pot are in crystals, and one-third\r\nliquid; and when he sees this to be the case, instead of ladling out the\r\ncrystals ladleful by ladleful, as in the old Pattinson process, he taps\r\nout the liquid lead by means of two pipes, controlled by valves, the\r\ncrystals being retained in the pot by means of perforated plates.\r\n\r\nThe liquid lead is run into large cone-shaped moulds on either side of\r\nthe pot; and a wrought iron ring being cast into the blocks thus formed,\r\nthey are readily lifted, when set, by the crane. To give some idea of\r\nthe rapidity of the process, it may be mentioned that from the time the\r\nlead is melted and fit to work in the big pot, to the time that it is\r\ncrystallized and ready for tapping, is, in the case of a 36 ton pot,\r\nfrom thirty-five to forty-five minutes; and the time required for\r\ntapping the liquid lead into the large moulds is about eight minutes.\r\n\r\nBefore the lead begins to crystallize, the upper pot is charged with\r\nlead of half the richness of that in the lower pot. Thus, when the\r\nliquid lead has been tapped out of the lower pot, it is replaced by a\r\nsimilar amount of lead of the same richness as the remaining crystals,\r\nby simply tapping the upper or melting pot, and allowing the contents to\r\nrun among the crystals.\r\n\r\nThe same operation is repeated from time to time, until the crystals are\r\nso poor in silver that they are fit to be melted, and run into pigs for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe large blocks of partially worked lead are placed by the crane in\r\na semicircle round it, and pass successively through the subsequent\r\noperations. The advantages of the steam process, as compared to the old\r\nsix-ton Pattinson pots formerly used by the writer's firm, are: (1) a\r\nsaving of two-thirds amount of fuel used; (2) the saving of cost of\r\ncalcination of the lead to the extent of at least four-fifths of\r\nall that is used; (3) above all, a saving in labor to the extent of\r\ntwo-thirds. The process has its disadvantages, and these are a larger\r\noriginal outlay for plant, and a constant expense in renewals and\r\nrepairs. This is principally caused by the breakage of pots; but with\r\nincreased experience this item has been very much reduced during the\r\nlast two or three years.\r\n\r\nThe \"zinc process\" of desilverizing, which is largely used by Messrs.\r\nLocke, Blackett & Co., and was patented in the form adopted by them\r\nabout fourteen years since. The action of this process is dependent on\r\nthe affinity of zinc for silver. The following is a brief description of\r\nit:\r\n\r\nA charge of silver lead, usually about fifteen tons, is heated to a\r\npoint considerably above that which is used in either the Pattinson or\r\nthe steam process. The quantity of zinc added is regulated by the amount\r\nof silver contained in the lead; but for lead containing 50 oz. to the\r\nton, the quantity of zinc used is in most cases about 1½ per cent, of\r\nthe charge of lead. The lead being melted as described, a portion of\r\nthis zinc, usually about half of the total quantity required for the\r\ncharge, is added to the melted lead, and thoroughly mixed with it by\r\ncontinued stirring. The lead is now allowed to cool, when the zinc is\r\nseen gradually to rise to the top, having incorporated with it a large\r\nproportion of the silver. The setting point of zinc being above that\r\nof lead, a zinc crust is gradually formed, and this is broken up and\r\ncarefully lifted off into a small pot conveniently placed, care being\r\ntaken to let as much lead drain off as possible. The fire is again\r\napplied strongly to the pot, and when the lead is sufficiently heated, a\r\nfurther quantity of zinc, about one-third of the whole quantity used, is\r\nadded, when the same process of cooling and removing the zinc crust is\r\nrepeated. This operation is gone through a third time with the remaining\r\nportion--¼ per cent.--of zinc; and if each of these operations has\r\nbeen carefully carried out, the lead will be found to be completely\r\ndesilverized, and will only show a very small trace of zinc. In some\r\nworks this trace of zinc is allowed to remain in the market lead, but\r\nat Messrs. Locke, Blackett & Co.'s works it is invariably removed by\r\nsubjecting the lead to a high heat in a calcining furnace. The zinc\r\ncrusts, rich in silver, are freed as far as possible from the lead by\r\nallowing this to sweat out in the small pot, after which the crusts are\r\nplaced in a covered crucible, where the zinc is distilled off, and a\r\nportion of it recovered. The lead remaining, which is extremely rich in\r\nsilver, is then taken to the refinery, and treated in the usual manner.\r\nThe writer is given to understand that the quantity of zinc recovered is\r\nas high as from 50 to 60 per cent. of the total quantity used.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was said that the rolling or milling of lead remains\r\nunchanged in its main features since the first mill was established, yet\r\nthe writer's firm have introduced many important improvements. When lead\r\nis required for sheet making, instead of running out the market lead\r\ninto the usual pigs of about one hundredweight each, it is run into\r\nlarge blocks of 3½ tons. These 3½ ton blocks are taken on a bogie to the\r\nmill-house, where the mill melting pot is charged with them by means\r\nof a double-powered hydraulic crane, lifting, however, with the single\r\npower only.\r\n\r\nThree such blocks fill the pot, and when melted are tapped on to a large\r\ncasting plate, 8 ft. 4 in. by 7 ft. 6 in., and about 7 in. thick. This\r\nblock, weighing 10½ tons, is lifted on to the mill table by the same\r\ncrane as fills the pot, but using the double power; and is moved along\r\nto the rolls in the usual manner by means of a rope working on a surging\r\nhead. The mill itself, as regards the roll, is much the same as those\r\nof other firms; but instead of an engine with a heavy fly-wheel, always\r\nworking in one direction, and connected to the rolls by double clutch\r\nand gearing, the work is done by a pair of horizontal reversing engines,\r\nin connection with which there is a very simple, and at the same time\r\nextremely effectual, system of hydraulic reversing. On the usual method\r\nthere is no necessity for full or delicate control of lead mill engines;\r\nbut with this system it is essential, and the hydraulic reversing gear\r\ncontributes largely to such control. This may be explained as follows:\r\n\r\nIn all other mills with which the writer is acquainted, when the lead\r\nsheet, or the original block, has passed through the rolls, and before\r\nit can be sent back in the opposite direction, a man on either side of\r\nthe mill must work it into the grip of the rolls with crowbars.\r\n\r\nIn the writer's system this labor is avoided, and the sheet or block is\r\nfed in automatically by means of subsidiary rolls, which are driven by\r\npower. When it is required to cut the block or sheet by the guillotine,\r\nor cross-cutting knife, instead of the block being moved to the desired\r\npoint by hand-labor, the subsidiary driven rolls work it up to the\r\nknife; and such perfect control does the engine with its hydraulic\r\nreversing gear possess, that should the sheet overshoot the knife\r\n1/8 in., or even less, the engine would bring it back to this extent\r\nexactly.\r\n\r\nAnother point, which the writer looks upon as one of the greatest\r\nimprovements in this mill, is its being furnished with circular knives,\r\nwhich can be set to any desired width, and put in or out of gear at\r\nwill; and which are used for dressing up the finished sheet in the\r\nlongitudinal direction. This is a simple mechanical arrangement, but\r\none which is found to be of immense benefit, and which, in the writer's\r\nopinion, is far superior to the usual practice of marking off the sheet\r\nwith a chalk line, and then dressing off with hand knives. The last\r\nlength of the mill table forms a weighbridge, and a hydraulic crane\r\nlifts the sheet from it either on to the warehouse floor or the tramway\r\ncommunicating with the shipping quay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS USED IN BERLIN FOR THE PREPARATION OF GELATINE PLATES.\r\n\r\nI.--MIXING APPARATUS FOR GELATINE EMULSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mixing vessel--a porcelain kettle capable of containing twenty\r\nliters, made at the Royal Porcelain Factory at Berlin, whose products\r\nare unequaled for chemical purposes--is also the boiling vessel, and,\r\ntherefore, fits tightly, by means of the tin ring with the wooden\r\nhandles, on to a large water bath. The light-tight metal lid, which\r\ncan be permanently affixed to the kettle, then supports a stirring\r\narrangement of fine silver, which dips into the emulsion and has blades\r\nformed like a ship's screw.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for injecting the silver vary. The simplest consists of\r\na large glass vessel containing the silver solution, which is closed\r\nby a glass stopper, and terminates below in a funnel running to a fine\r\npoint. This funnel-shaped bottle fits into an opening specially made for\r\nit in the lid of the kettle, and while revolving sends a fine stream\r\ninto the gelatine. When it is wished to interrupt it, it is only\r\nnecessary to raise the glass stopper in order to see the stream dry up\r\nafter a short time.\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement consists of a contrivance constructed on the\r\nprinciple of the common India-rubber inhaling apparatus, and sends\r\nthe silver solution into the gelatine in the form of the minutest\r\nair-bubbles. After the emulsion is boiled in such a kettle it is allowed\r\nto stand until cool, when the ammonia is added. With such a great\r\nquantity of emulsion and so large a water bath sufficient heat is\r\nretained as to allow the action of the ammonia to take place. As soon\r\nas the time set apart for that reaction has elapsed the water bath is\r\nemptied and filled with pieces of ice and iced water, and the kettle\r\nreplaced in it.\r\n\r\nIf the stirring apparatus be now set in motion, even this large quantity\r\nof emulsion will stiffen in at least an hour and a half. It may be\r\nfurther remarked that, the outside of the kettle being black, the lid\r\nbeing light-tight, and all the apertures in it being firmly closed,\r\nnearly the whole process can be conducted by daylight, from the mixing\r\nto the stiffening, so that it is very convenient to be able to keep the\r\nemulsion in the same vessel during all these operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--DIGESTIVE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable that those who do not prepare their emulsion by\r\nboiling, but by prolonged digestion, should possess a regulator which\r\nwill keep the temperature at a given point. Such an apparatus would also\r\nbe very useful for warming the emulsion for the preparation of plates,\r\nas then one would have no further occasion to pay attention to the\r\nthermometer and gas stove. In the accompanying diagram a simple\r\ncontrivance is shown. The gas which feeds the stove passes through\r\na narrow glass tube, a b, into the wider tube, c d e, which is made\r\nair-tight at e. This latter tube has an exit tube at f, by which the gas\r\nis supplied to the gas stove. At e it is hermetically closed, and at its\r\ndeepest part it contains mercury, upon which a little sulphuric ether\r\nfloats in the hermetically-closed limb, e.g. Lastly, there is a minute\r\nopening in the narrowest tube at i. The whole apparatus, or, at least,\r\nthe under part of it, is dipped into the water bath warmed by the gas\r\nboiler. It acts thus: As the temperature rises the ethereal vapor in the\r\nshorter limb expands and drives the mercury up the longer tube until\r\nit closes the opening of the narrow tube, a b, and thereby impedes the\r\npower of the stream of gas. Still, the Bunsen burner does not go out,\r\nbeing always fed by the small opening, i, with sufficient gas to support\r\na small flame until the water bath has so far cooled as to leave the\r\nopening at b free, when the burner again burns with a strong flame. By\r\nremoving the cork, c, from the tube the temperature of the water bath is\r\nraised, while by pushing it in it is lowered. The apparatus never goes\r\nwrong, and is very cheap. It was first made by Herr C. Braun, of Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--TRITURATING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus hereafter described is in general use, and was invented\r\nby Herr Paul Grundner, of Berlin. It is particularly adapted for finely\r\ndividing large quantities of emulsion. It consists essentially of a\r\nwooden lid, a b, fitting upon a large stone pot, to the under side of\r\nwhich two strong trapezoid pieces of wood, e d and e f, are fixed, in\r\nthe under part of which semicircular incisions are cut and held together\r\nby two leather straps, supporting a strong, easily-removable iron\r\ntransverse bar, g h. Through the center of the lid, and turned by the\r\ncrank, m, passes the axle i, which ends under the lid in the long ring,\r\nn.\r\n\r\nThe stiffened emulsion is then placed in the bag, o p q r, made of\r\nfine but strong canvas, with meshes about 0.5 mm. (such as is used for\r\nworking upon with Berlin wool). The iron rod, g h, is then slipped\r\nthrough the four loops at the bottom of the bag, the open end is slung\r\nupon the ring, n, and bound tightly to it by the ribbons, r1. The loops\r\nupon the iron bar are then pushed as close together in the middle as\r\npossible, and the stone vessel is filled with water until o p q r is\r\ncompletely covered. The crank is then turned, by which the bag is wrung,\r\nand the emulsion squeezed through the meshes immediately into the water.\r\nWhen this process is continued until the purse between n and g h feels\r\nlike a metal rod, the best part of the emulsion has been squeezed\r\nthrough, and if one now take out the bag and dissolve its contents, it\r\nwill be found that the loss of emulsion is almost _nil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that the whole apparatus, with the exception of the\r\ncrank, must be coated with asphalt varnish; also that the corners, r and\r\nq, must be separated off from the purse, as shown by the dotted line, s\r\ns s s, otherwise the emulsion would lodge there without being squeezed\r\nthrough. Instead of g h a strong glass rod may be used for small\r\napparatus; but for large apparatus it is indispensable, as the power\r\nthat requires to be exerted would be far too great for glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--WASHING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of the apparatus shown in Fig. 3 first occurred\r\nto Herr Jos. Junk, of Berlin. In the present form all the subsequent\r\nimprovements made by Herren Carl Such, Paul Grundner, and others are\r\nincorporated. It may be described as follows:\r\n\r\nA tin vessel, the bottom of which sinks at e into the shape of a funnel,\r\nrests upon strong iron feet, f f, and is covered with a lid, having a\r\ndouble edge closing it light-tight. Through the center of the lid passes\r\nthe tube, g h, by which the water enters. In the interior of the vessel\r\nupon iron hooks stands a wooden vessel saturated with paraffine, open at\r\nthe ends, and over one end of which the finest hair cloth is stretched\r\nat o p. The water which enters the vessel runs off through the siphon.\r\nThe proceedings are as follows: Turn the granulated gelatine and the\r\nwater in which it is contained into the horsehair sieve, m n o p. Place\r\nthe lid upon the apparatus and turn on the water. The whole apparatus\r\nfills with water until the siphon begins to act. If the diameter of\r\nthe siphon be properly measured--one inch should be sufficient for the\r\nlargest apparatus--and the cock by which the water is turned on properly\r\nadjusted, more water will run out by the siphon than runs in through the\r\nsupply pipe, and the apparatus becomes completely empty.\r\n\r\nThe siphon has then performed its function, the apparatus fills again,\r\nand the play begins anew. The tube, g h, which reaches right down nearly\r\nto the bottom of the sieve, takes the water so deep into the vessel\r\nthat, as long as the water in the apparatus stands high enough above o\r\np, the gelatine nodules are in continuous motion. In order to prevent\r\nthe finest particles of the emulsion from stopping up the pores of the\r\nsieve too much, and thereby incurring the danger of the water in the\r\nsieve overflowing its upper edge, thus occasioning loss of emulsion,\r\nthe tube, g h, is now sometimes omitted and replaced by a supply pipe,\r\nrepresented in the diagram by the dotted lines, x y. In this way\r\nevery possibility of loss is excluded, and yet a very careful washing\r\nprovided. Then when, after being emptied by the siphon, the apparatus\r\nfills again, every particle of the emulsion which might have formerly\r\nbeen pressed down into the interstices of the sieve would now be driven\r\nup again by the upward pressure of the water entering from below, and\r\nthus the sieve would always be kept clear and open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe great advantages of this apparatus are as follows: 1. From the\r\nmoment the lid is closed one can work by daylight. 2. The method of\r\nwashing in moving water is combined with that of complete change of\r\nwater. 3. The emulsion never comes in contact with metal. 4. Whoever\r\nwishes to prepare dry gelatine only requires, when the washing is over\r\nand the vessel perfectly emptied, to leave the emulsion to drip for a\r\ntime, and then to lift out the sieve and its contents and place it in\r\na suitable vessel with absolute alcohol. The latter should be changed\r\nonce, and when sufficient water has been extracted the sieve should be\r\nwithdrawn from the vessel and the emulsion allowed to dry spontaneously.\r\nIn this way all trouble occasioned by changing from vessel to vessel is\r\navoided, and there is no loss of material.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is principally valuable in dealing with large quantities,\r\nsince it saves a great deal of labor, and affords perfect certainty of\r\nthe emulsion being well washed. It may not be unnecessary to maintain\r\nthat the difficulties of perfect washing--particularly if one do not\r\nwash with running water--increase at least in quadruple proportion to\r\nthe quantity of emulsion manipulated.--_Franz Stoke, Ph.D., in Br. Jour,\r\nof Photography_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE EMULSION IN HOT WEATHER.\r\n\r\nBy A. L. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous complaints have reached me within the last few weeks of the\r\ndifficulty experienced in preparing emulsion and coating plates; one is\r\nvery likely to blame everything but the right, but doubtless the weather\r\nis the culprit.\r\n\r\nI have always held that to boil gelatine is to spoil it, and, even when\r\nemulsification is made with a few grains to the ounce and cooled down\r\nbefore adding the bulk, the damage is done to the smaller quantity,\r\nso that when mixed it contaminates the whole mass; moreover, it is\r\nimpossible to set and wash the gelatine without the aid of ice.\r\n\r\nI have lately made several batches (with the thermometer at 92° in the\r\nshade, and the washing water at 78°) as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hard gelatine...............,......    ½  ounce.\r\n  Water..............................  2    ounces.\r\n  Alcohol............................  2      \"\r\n  Bromide ammonia....................150    grains.\r\n  Liquor ammonia, 880................ 60    drops.\r\n\r\nWhen all is thoroughly dissolved and of about 120° temperature, add,\r\nstirring all the time,\r\n\r\n  Nitrate silver..................... 60    grains,\r\n  Water..............................    ¾  ounce.\r\n  Alcohol............................    ¾    \"\r\n\r\nThen again add,\r\n\r\n  Nitrate silver.....................140    grains.\r\n  Water..............................  1    ounce.\r\n  Alcohol............................  1      \"\r\n\r\nBoth solutions being warmed to about 120°.\r\n\r\nMy object is adding the silver in two quantities will be obvious to\r\nmany--viz., when the first portion of silver is mixed, nitrate of\r\nammonia is liberated (which is a powerful restrainer), and the bulk of\r\nthe solution being increased, the remainder of the silver may be added\r\nin a much more concentrated state.\r\n\r\nThe alcohol, both in the gelatine and silver solutions, plays a most\r\nimportant part: (1) It prevents decomposition of the gelatine. (2) It\r\nallows the gelatine to be precipitated with a much smaller quantity of\r\nalcohol (say about 10 ounces).\r\n\r\nAfter letting the emulsion stand for a few minutes to ripen, I pour in\r\nslowly about eight ounces of alcohol, stirring all the time, and keeping\r\nthe emulsion warm; the emulsion will adhere to the stirring-rod and the\r\nbottom of the vessel in a soft mass, and all that is now required is to\r\npour away the alcohol, allow the emulsion to cool, tear it into small\r\npieces, wash in several changes of cold water, make up the quantity to\r\nten ounces, and strain; it is then ready for coating.\r\n\r\nBy this formula I have no difficulties whatever; my plates set in about\r\nfive minutes, and their quality is such that, \"unless a better method is\r\ndevised,\" I intend to adopt it in all weathers.\r\n\r\nOne word more as to the alcohol. It will prevent the decomposition of\r\ngelatine when boiling goes on, or when in the presence of foreign salts;\r\nno flocculent deposit is noticed in the alcohol after the emulsion has\r\nbeen precipitated.--_Photographic News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTILLATION AND RECTIFICATION OF ALCOHOLS BY THE RATIONAL USE OF\r\nLOW TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\nBy RAOUL PICTET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industrial problem of the rectification of alcohols is based\r\nentirely upon the properties of volatile liquids, upon the laws of the\r\nmaximum tensions of the vapors of these liquids, and upon the influence\r\nof temperature upon those different elements which find themselves in\r\npresence of each other in an alembic.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to follow, in their least details, all the phenomena which\r\nsucceed one another in a rectifying column, and which are connected with\r\none another by a continuous chain of reciprocal influences, the problem\r\nbecomes exceedingly complex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICTET'S APPARATUS FOR THE RECTIFICATION OF ALCOHOL BY\r\nCOLD.]\r\n\r\nIn order that the new applications of the mechanical theory of heat may\r\nbe readily understood, we shall divide this problem into a series of\r\npropositions, which we shall examine separately, and which collectively\r\nconstitutes in its general features the methodical rectification of\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\nI. Knowing the maximum tensions of pure water and pure alcohol, can we\r\ncalculate directly the tensions of the vapors of any mixture whatever of\r\nalcohol and water?\r\n\r\nYes, we can calculate this tension by a general formula, provided we\r\ntake into account the affinity of water for alcohol, which increases the\r\nvalue of the total latent heat of evaporation of the liquid. The results\r\nof the calculation are fully confirmed by experience. We thus establish\r\nthe following laws:\r\n\r\na. For any temperature whatever, the maximum tension of the vapors of a\r\nmixture of water and alcohol is always comprised between that of pure\r\nwater and that of pure alcohol.\r\n\r\nb. The tension of the vapors of a mixture of water and alcohol\r\napproaches the tension of alcohol so much the nearer in proportion as\r\nthe proof is higher; and, reciprocally, if water is in excess, the\r\ntension of the vapors approaches the tension of the vapors of water.\r\n\r\nc. The curves of the maximum tensions of vapors formed by all mixtures\r\nof alcohol and water are represented by the same general formula, one\r\nfactor only of which is a function of the richness of the alcoholic\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIt results, then, from these laws that we may determine with the\r\ngreatest exactness the richness of a solution containing alcohol and\r\nwater, if we know the tension of the vapors that it gives off at a\r\ncertain temperature. Such indications are confirmed by the centigrade\r\nalcoholmeter.\r\n\r\nWe see likewise that, for these solutions of alcohol and water, the\r\nlaws of Dalton are completely at fault, since the total pressure of the\r\nvapors is never equal to the sum of the tensions of the two liquids,\r\nwater and alcohol.\r\n\r\nII. Being given a solution of water and alcohol, mixed in equal volumes,\r\nwhat will be the quality of the vapors emitted from it?\r\n\r\nIn other terms, do the vapors which escape from a definite mixture of\r\nwater and alcohol also contain volumes of vapor of water and alcohol in\r\nthe same proportion as the liquids?\r\n\r\nWe have discovered the following laws:\r\n\r\nd. The quality of the vapors emitted by a mixture of water and alcohol\r\nvaries according to the alcoholic richness of the solution, but is not\r\nin simple proportion thereto.\r\n\r\ne. The quality of the vapors emitted by a definite mixture of water and\r\nalcohol varies according to the temperature.\r\n\r\nf. In a same solution of water and alcohol, it is at low temperatures\r\nthat the vapors emitted by the mixture contain the largest proportion of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\ng. The more the temperature rises the more the tensions of the two\r\nliquids tend to become equalized.\r\n\r\nWe have been able to verify these different laws experimentally, and\r\nto find an interesting confirmation of our general formula of maximum\r\ntensions, in the following way:\r\n\r\nLet us take a test tube containing a 50 per cent. solution of alcohol\r\nand water, plunge it into water of 20°C., and put its interior in\r\nhermetic communication with the receiver of a mercurial air-pump.\r\n\r\nWe vaporize at 20° a certain quantity of the liquid, and the vapors\r\nfill the known capacity of the pump. The pressure of the gases in the\r\ninterior is ascertained by a pressure gauge, and this pressure should be\r\nconstant if care is taken to act upon a sufficient mass of liquid and\r\nwith moderate speed. When the receiver of the air-pump is full of\r\nvapors, communication between it and the test-tube is shut off, and\r\ncommunication is effected with a second test-tube, like the first,\r\nplunged into the same water at 20°. Care must be taken beforehand to\r\ncreate a perfect vacuum in this test-tube.\r\n\r\nOn causing the mercury to rise into the space that it previously\r\noccupied, the vapors are made to condense in the second test-tube at the\r\nsame temperature as that at which they were formed.\r\n\r\nWe immediately ascertain that the pressure-gauge shows an elevation\r\nof pressure; moreover, the proof of the condensed alcohol has very\r\nperceptibly risen.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of causing these vapors to condense in the second test-tube,\r\nwe leave the first communication open, the vapors recondense in the\r\nfirst test-tube without any elevation of pressure; and we do not see the\r\nleast trace of liquid forming in the second test tube.\r\n\r\nThis difference of pressure in the two foregoing experiments must be\r\nattributed, then, to the specific action of the water on the vapors of\r\nalcohol. Now we can calculate the difference of the work of the pump,\r\nand put at 1 kilogramme of condensed liquid the difference of mechanical\r\nwork represented in kilogrammeters. What is remarkable is that this\r\ndifference is absolutely the equivalent of the heat disengaged when the\r\ncondensed liquid and the old liquid are remixed; there is a complete\r\nidentity. Thus the affinity of the water for the alcohol modifies the\r\ntension of the vapors which form or condense upon the free surface of\r\nthe mixture. The two phenomena are closely connected by the law of\r\nequivalence.\r\n\r\nIt results from all the laws that we have cited that by properly\r\nregulating the tensions of the vapors of a mixture of alcohol and water,\r\nand the temperature of the liquid, we shall be able to obtain a liquid\r\nof a desired richness by the condensation of these vapors.\r\n\r\nIII. It was likewise indispensable to make sure of one important fact:\r\nWhen the temperature of a liquid like alcohol is considerably lowered,\r\ncan the distillation of a given weight of this substance be effected\r\nwith sufficient rapidity for industrial requirements? Repeated\r\nexperiments with a host of volatile liquids have demonstrated the\r\nfollowing laws:\r\n\r\nIf we introduce a volatile liquid into two spherical receivers connected\r\nby a wide tube, and if these be kept at different temperatures after\r\ndriving out all the air from the apparatus, the liquid distills from the\r\nwarmer into the cooler receiver, and we ascertain that:\r\n\r\nh. The weight of the liquid which distills in the unit of time increases\r\nwith the deviation of temperature between the two receivers.\r\n\r\ni. The weight of the liquid which distills in the unit of time is\r\nconstant for a same deviation of temperature between the receivers,\r\nwhatever be, moreover, the absolute temperature of the receivers.\r\n\r\nk. The weight of the liquid distilled in the unit of time is\r\nproportional to the active surfaces of the receivers; that is to say,\r\nto the surfaces which are the seat of passage of heat through their\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nl. The least trace of a foreign gas in the vapors left in the apparatus\r\nthrows the preceding laws into confusion, and checks distillation to a\r\nconsiderable degree, especially at low temperatures.\r\n\r\nThus, water distilling between 100° and 60° will pass over as quickly\r\nas that which is distilling between 40° and 0°. Absolute temperature is\r\nwithout influence, provided every trace of air or foreign gas be got rid\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe distillatory apparatus should be provided with an excellent\r\nair-pump, capable of preventing all those entrances of air which are\r\ninevitable in practice.\r\n\r\nThe following is the industrial application that we have endeavored to\r\nmake of these theoretical views: The rectification of alcohols is one\r\nof the most complex of operations; it looks toward several results\r\nsimultaneously. Alcohol derived from the fermentation of grain, sugar,\r\nand of all starchy matters in general, contains an innumerable host of\r\ndifferent products, which may be grouped under four principal heads:\r\n\r\n1. Empyreumatic essential oils, characteristic of the source of the\r\nalcohol, and having a powerful odor which infects the total mass of\r\nthe crude spirits. 2. A considerable quantity of water. 3. A certain\r\nquantity of pure alcohol. 4. A variable proportion of volatile\r\nsubstances, composed in great part of ethers, different alcohols, and\r\nbodies as yet not well defined. These latter affect the quality of\r\nthe alcohol by an odor which is entirely different from that of the\r\nessential oils.\r\n\r\nThe object of rectification is to bring out No. 3 all alone; that is\r\nto say, to extract the alcohol in a pure state by ridding it of oils,\r\nwater, ether, and foreign alcohols.\r\n\r\nThe alcohol industry never realizes this operation in an absolutely\r\ncomplete manner. All the rectifying apparatus in operation at the\r\npresent day are based on the use of high temperatures varying between\r\n78.5° and 100°. The successive condensation and vaporization of the\r\nvapors issuing from the spirits effect in the rectifying columns a\r\npartial separation of these liquids, and there are received successively\r\nas products of rectification:\r\n\r\n1. Bad tasting alcohols, containing the majority of the ethers and\r\nimpure alcohols.\r\n\r\n2. Fine alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. Alcohols contaminated by notable proportions of empyreumatic oils.\r\n\r\nIndustry knows only one means of obtaining an excellent product, and\r\nthat is to diminish the quantity of fine alcohol which comes from a same\r\nlot of spirits, and to make a large number of successive distillations.\r\nHence the large expenses attending rectification, which produce fine\r\nalcohols necessarily at an elevated price. We may remark, in passing,\r\nthat the toxic action of commercial alcohols is in great part caused by\r\nthe presence of essential oils, amylic alcohol, and ethers, absolutely\r\npure alcohol, as compared with these, being relatively innocent.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that our present apparatus cannot produce good results in\r\nrectifying alcohol? Because they are limited by the temperature at which\r\nthey must operate. Between 78° and 100° the tension of the vapors of all\r\nthe liquids mixed in the spirits is considerable for each of them; they\r\nall pass over, then, in certain proportions during the operation of\r\nrectification.\r\n\r\nWe have been led, by examining the theoretical question, to ascertain\r\nthat the proportion of alcohol which evaporates from a mixture is\r\nmaximum at low temperatures; consequently, we should seek to establish\r\nsome arrangement which can realize the following conditions: (1) Render\r\nvariable, at will, the temperature of the boiling liquid; and (2),\r\nrender variable the pressure of the vapors which act on the liquid.\r\n\r\nThus, to effect the rectification of alcohol it suffices to cause its\r\nebullition at very low temperatures, and to keep up the ebullition\r\nwithout changing such temperatures when once obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is exactly these two conditions that we have fulfilled in the\r\napparatus that we have just installed in our factory in Rue Immeubles\r\nIndustriels, at Paris.\r\n\r\nBy their arrangement, which is shown in the opposite figure, they form\r\na mechanical system permitting of the rectification of alcohols at\r\ntemperatures as low as -40° or even -50°. They verify experimentally, by\r\ntheir operation, the theoretical deductions which precede. The boilers,\r\nA, which, in an industrial application, may be more numerous, receive\r\ntheir supply of spirits from the country distilleries in the vicinity of\r\nthe factory. There may even be introduced directly into them _vinasses_,\r\nor washes, that is to say, liquids, such as are obtained by alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nAbove the boiler rises a rectifying column composed of superposed plates\r\ninclined one over the other, and surmounted by a tubular condenser,\r\nwhich serves to effect the retrogression of the first condensation by\r\nmeans of a current of water supplied by the reservoir placed above.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this condenser, the vapors which have escaped condensation\r\npass into the refrigerator, C, where they are totally condensed by a\r\ncurrent of water which goes to the reservoir above.\r\n\r\nThe first products obtained contain ethers and impure alcohols, which\r\nare collected in the reservoir, E.\r\n\r\nWhen the first products have been thus introduced into the reservoir,\r\nand it is ascertained by tasting that good alcohol is passing over,\r\nthe liquid produced is directed into the second boiler, F. The sliding\r\nvalve, operated by a screw having a very fine pitch, establishes a\r\ncommunication between the refrigerator, C, and the second boiler, F. The\r\noffice of this valve we shall learn further on. This first rectification\r\nis performed in a vacuum, for a system of metallic pipes connects the\r\nentire apparatus with an air-pump, O. The temperature at which the\r\nliquids shall enter into ebullition in the boilers, A A, may, then, be\r\nregulated in advance.\r\n\r\nThe operations will be carried on with a more or less complete vacuum,\r\naccording to the nature of the products to be rectified. The distiller\r\nwill have to be guided in this by practice alone.\r\n\r\nThe good tasted products are received in boiler No. 2, F, and there the\r\nliquids are submitted to the action of an almost absolute vacuum. As we\r\nhave before said, their temperature falls immediately and spontaneously.\r\nThe vapors which issue from this liquid contain almost solely pure\r\nalcohol. The other substances, which passed over in the first\r\ndistillation, no longer emit vapors at temperatures ranging between -10°\r\nand +5°. Their temperature is shown by a thermometer running into the\r\nboiler, F.\r\n\r\nThese vapors, purified by ebullition at a low temperature, rise into a\r\nsecond rectifying column, G, which terminates in the refrigerator, H,\r\nfilled with liquid sulphurous anhydride. This refrigerator is like those\r\nwhich we employ in our sulphurous anhydride frigorific apparatus. Under\r\nthe action of a special pump, M, this liquid produces and maintains a\r\nconstant temperature of -25° to -30° in the refrigerator. The vapors of\r\nalcohol condense therein at this low temperature, and the cold liquid\r\nalcohol flows into the lower part of the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nBy the action of a return cock, a portion of this liquid falls upon\r\nthe plates of the column, G, and descends, while the vapors are rising\r\ntherein. The other portion of the liquid obtained flows into the\r\nreservoir, K, at the beginning of the operation, and into the reservoir,\r\nL, during all the remainder of the rectification. The ice-making machine\r\nkeeps up of itself alone the two operations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the exhaust of the steam engine which actuates the sulphurous\r\nanhydride pump is directed into a worm which circulates through the\r\nfirst boiler, A, and the refrigerator, H, of the frigorific machine\r\nkeeps up the second rectification, which was brought about below the\r\nsurrounding temperature, and which for this reason takes place without\r\nnecessitating any combustion of coal. It suffices to cause the current\r\nof water which issues from the condenser of the frigorific machine to\r\npass into the worm of the boiler.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, two results, two like operations, both produced by\r\nthe working of a single machine. Moreover, these two operations are\r\nperformed _in vacuo_, and we know that under these conditions they are\r\neffected at lower temperatures. Owing to this fact, likewise, the weight\r\nof the water that must be evaporated diminishes just so much. Now, one\r\nkilogramme of water requires 636 heat units to cause it to pass from the\r\nliquid to the gaseous state, while one kilogramme of alcohol requires\r\nonly 230 heat units to vaporize it. Thus every decrease of temperature\r\nin rectification has for an immediate corollary an important economy of\r\nfuel, which is proved by the diminution of radiation, and by the less\r\nquantity of water to be distilled.\r\n\r\nBetween the boilers, A, in which is maintained a temperature bordering\r\non +50° to +60°, and the refrigerator, H, in which is easily obtained\r\na temperature of -30° to -40°, there is at our disposal a range of\r\ntemperature of nearly 100°, an immense difference compared with that\r\nwhich can be made use of in ordinary apparatus. Thanks to this powerful\r\nfactor, which is manageable at will, we can take directly from the\r\napparatus alcohols marking 98 and 99 degrees by the centigrade\r\nalcoholmeter. Such results are unobtainable by the usual methods.\r\n\r\nWe have likewise ascertained that at low temperatures the ebullition of\r\nalcohol is as active as at near 100°.\r\n\r\nFor a same range of temperature between the boiler and the refrigerator,\r\nthe weight of alcohol which distills in an hour is constant. By the\r\noperation of the valve, D, it becomes easy to allow all the liquid\r\ncondensed in the first refrigerator to pass into the second boiler;\r\nand thus the second rectification, which is effected in a more perfect\r\nvacuum, is supplied with exactness. The object of this valve, then, is\r\nto allow the liquid to pass, and yet to cut off the pressure in such\r\na way as to have a double fall of temperature throughout the whole\r\napparatus; from 60° to 20° in the first operation, and from 0° to -40°\r\nin the second. We may add that the regulation of the valve is extremely\r\neasy, because of the screw which actuates it.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the commercial advantages that our process procures, we may\r\nsay that it realizes the following _desiderata_: 1. With the cost of a\r\nsingle distillation we have, at once, distillation and rectification,\r\nor a single expense for two results. 2. With one operation at a low\r\ntemperature we obtain products which are almost impossible to get even\r\nby an indefinite number of rectifications at a high temperature, the\r\ntemperature having an intrinsic value in the operation. 3. The alcohols\r\nobtained are wholesome, and can be put on the market without danger. 4.\r\nTheir superior quality gives these alcohols an extra value difficult\r\nto calculate, but which is very notable. 5. The whole operation being\r\nperformed in closed vessels, there is absolutely no waste. 6. For the\r\nsame reason there is scarcely any danger of fire. 7. The management of\r\nthe works and the service are performed by the pressure of the gases\r\nentirely; there are only a few cocks to be turned to perform all the\r\ninterior maneuvers, empty and fill the vessels, etc. Hence economy in\r\n_personnel_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROLYTIC DETERMINATIONS AND SEPARATIONS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: NOTE.--Each of these determinations was accompanied by a\r\nseries of results in which the practical determinations obtained from\r\nthe method described were compared with the theoretical contents of the\r\nsolutions of the various elements. These, however, would take up too\r\nmuch room for insertion in these columns.]\r\n\r\nBy ALEX. CLASSEN and M.A. VON REIS; translated by M. BENJAMIN, Ph.B.,\r\nF.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the electrolytic method for the estimation of copper came\r\ninto general use, numerous chemists have endeavored to adapt this\r\npeculiarly simple and elegant method to the determination of other\r\nmetals. According to the experiments which have been made up to the\r\npresent time, it has been found that the separation of copper is best\r\neffected in a nitric acid solution, while that of nickel and cobalt\r\ntakes place most readily in an ammoniacal solution, and for the\r\nprecipitation of zinc and cadmium a potassium cyanide solution is the\r\nbest. The accuracy of the results depend chiefly upon the following of\r\ncertain fixed rules, such as, for instance, that the precipitation of\r\ncopper only takes place when there is a definite amount of nitric acid\r\nin the solution; that of cobalt and nickel when a certain quantity of\r\nammonium hydrate and ammonium sulphate is present. The electrolytic\r\ndecomposition of the chlorides has not yet been successfully\r\naccomplished, so that prior to the operation it is necessary to convert\r\nthem into sulphates. The experiments which have been made for the\r\npurpose of investigating the application of the electric current in\r\nquantitative analyses are very few, about the only exception being the\r\nseparation of copper from the metals which are not precipitated from a\r\nnitric acid solution, or which are deposited as peroxides at the other\r\nelectrode. We shall endeavor to show in that which follows, that copper,\r\nzinc, nickel, and cobalt, and even iron, manganese, cadmium, bismuth,\r\nand tin, whether they be present as sulphates, chlorides, or nitrates,\r\nmay be precipitated and separated from each other by electrolytic\r\nmethods much more rapidly than by any previously known process.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF COBALT.\r\n\r\nNeutral potassium oxalate is added in excess to the solution of a cobalt\r\nsalt, and the clear solution of cobalt potassium oxalate submitted to\r\nelectrolysis. The intense red color of this solution is soon changed\r\ninto a dark green; the latter diminishing in intensity as the metal is\r\ndeposited at the negative electrode. The electric current decomposes the\r\npotassium oxalate into the carbonate, so that a precipitate of cobalt\r\ncarbonate is simultaneously formed with the separation of the metallic\r\ncobalt. This precipitate may be dissolved by adding oxalic acid or\r\ndilute sulphuric acid; the further action of the current will change the\r\nsolution to an alkaline reaction, upon which the treatment with acid is\r\nrepeated until all the cobalt has been separated out in its metallic\r\ncondition. The electrolytic separation of cobalt is much more easily\r\nand rapidly effected when the potassium oxalate is substituted by the\r\ncorresponding ammonium salt, as the latter forms a soluble double\r\nsalt with the cobalt compounds. If the ammonium oxalate added is just\r\nsufficient to form the double salt, a red cobalt oxalate (_which is only\r\nslowly reduced by the current_) will separate out in addition to the\r\ncobalt. In order to obviate this difficulty, the solution to which the\r\nammonium oxalate had been added in excess is heated, and then three\r\nor four grammes more of solid ammonium oxalate are added. The _hot_\r\nsolution, when exposed to the action of the current, deposits the cobalt\r\nas a closely adhering gray film. By the aid of two Bunsen's elements,\r\n0.2 gramme cobalt can be separated in an hour's time. When the reduction\r\nhas been completed, and this is best determined by testing a small\r\nsample (removed by a pipette) with ammonium sulphide, the positive\r\nelectrode[1] is removed from the solution, and the liquid poured off.\r\nThe dish is immediately rinsed several times with water, and the excess\r\nof water removed at first with alcohol, and then with absolute ether.\r\nThe cobalt in the dish is dried in the air bath at 100° C., and in the\r\ncourse of a few minutes a constant weight is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A piece of platinum foil, 4.5 cm. in diameter, is used\r\nfor the positive electrode, and a deep platinum dish as the negative\r\nelectrode.--_Vide_ \"Classen's Quantitative Analysis,\" 3d Edition, p.\r\n46.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF NICKEL.\r\n\r\nThis process is precisely identical with the previously described method\r\nfor cobalt. The ammonium oxalate is added in excess to the solution,\r\nwhich is then heated, and four more grammes of the solid salt added. The\r\nseparation of the nickel is as rapid as that of the cobalt. The nickel\r\nis precipitated as a gray, compact mass, tightly adhering to the\r\nelectrode.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF IRON.\r\n\r\nFor this estimation, solutions of the chloride as well as those of the\r\nsulphate (ammonium, iron, alum) may be used in the manner previously\r\ndescribed. The electrolysis is best effected in the presence of a\r\nsufficient quantity of ammonium oxalate; no separation of any iron\r\ncompound takes place. The iron is deposited in the form of a bright,\r\nsteel gray, firmly-adhering mass on the platinum dish. The iron may be\r\nexposed to the air for several days without any noticeable oxidation\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF ZINC.\r\n\r\nZinc may be separated from a solution of the double salt fully as easily\r\nand rapidly as the previously mentioned metals were. The reduced zinc\r\nhas a dark gray color, and adheres very firmly to the electrode. The\r\nseparated metal is dissolved by using dilute acids and heating. It is\r\nonly removed with difficulty, and generally leaves a dark coating on the\r\ndish, which is separated by repeated ignitions and treatment with acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nIt is already known that manganese may be separated as the peroxide from\r\nits nitric acid solution. We find, however, that the precipitation is\r\nonly completely effected when the quantity present is small; the amount\r\nof nitric acid must also be slight, and it is necessary to wash the dish\r\nwithout interrupting the current. If the manganese is converted into\r\nthe soluble double salt, prepared by adding an excess of potassium, and\r\nsubmitted to the electric current, the whole of the manganese will be\r\ndeposited at the positive electrode. When ammonium oxalate is used, the\r\ncomplete precipitation does not take place. As the separated peroxide\r\ndoes not adhere firmly to the electrode, it is necessary to filter it\r\nand convert it, by ignition, into the trimangano-tetroxide (Mn_3O_4).\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF BISMUTH.\r\n\r\nThis separation presents considerable difficulty, because the metal\r\nis not precipitated as a compact mass on the platinum. The bismuth is\r\nalways obtained in the same form, no matter whether it is precipitated\r\nfrom an acid solution, or from the double ammonium oxalate, or, finally,\r\nfrom a solution to which potassium tartrate has been added. As large a\r\nsurface as possible must be used, and the dish piled to the rim; then,\r\nif the quantity of bismuth is small, the washing with water, alcohol,\r\nand ether may be effected without any loss of the element. If small\r\nquantities of the metal separate from the dish, they must be collected\r\non a tared filter, and determined separately. In our experiments, an\r\nexcess of ammonium oxalate was added to a nitric acid solution of\r\nbismuth. During the electrolytic decomposition, a separation of the\r\nperoxide was observed at the positive electrode, which, however, slowly\r\ndisappeared. In order to prevent the reduced metal from oxidation, the\r\nlast traces of water are completely removed by repeated washings with\r\nalcohol and anhydrous ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF LEAD.\r\n\r\nThe nitric solution of lead acts similarly to that of manganese. When\r\nthe amount of peroxide separated is so large that it does not adhere\r\nfirmly, and becomes mechanically precipitated on the negative electrode,\r\nit becomes impossible to complete the estimation without loss from the\r\nsolution of the peroxide, and the results cannot be accepted.\r\n\r\nIf the double oxalate is submitted to electrolysis, the whole of the\r\nlead is separated out in its metallic state, but it is so rapidly\r\noxidized by the air that it is very seldom that it can be dried without\r\ndecomposition even when the operation is conducted in a current of\r\nilluminating gas. The electrolytic estimation of this element cannot be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF COPPER.\r\n\r\nThe copper may be very easily and rapidly separated from the double\r\nammonium oxalate salt, provided a sufficient excess of ammonium oxalate\r\nis present. Weak currents cannot be employed for the determination of\r\nthis element when it is present in large quantities, for under such\r\ncircumstances the metal does not adhere with sufficient firmness to the\r\nelectrode. We employed a current which corresponded to an evolution of\r\n330 c.c. of gas per hour, and we were able to precipitate 0.15 gramme\r\nmetallic copper in about twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF CADMIUM.\r\n\r\nWhen the cadmium ammonium oxalate is submitted to the action of the\r\nelectric current, the metal is thrown down in the form of a gray\r\ncoating, which does not adhere very firmly to the electrode, but,\r\nhowever, sufficiently so as not to become separated on careful washing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF TIN.\r\n\r\nTin may be easily estimated by electrolysis; it can be separated from\r\nits hydrochloric acid solution, or from its double salt with ammonium\r\noxalate, as a beautiful silver gray coating on the platinum. When the\r\nammonium oxalate is substituted by the potassium salt, the operation\r\nbecomes more difficult, as a basic salt is formed at the opposite\r\npole, and is not easily reduced. If the tin is separated from an acid\r\nsolution, the current must not be interrupted while the washing takes\r\nplace, a precaution which it is not necessary to follow when the\r\nammonium oxalate is used. When the tin is dissolved from the platinum\r\ndish, it acts like the zinc; that is to say, a black coating is left on\r\nthe electrode.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF ANTIMONY.\r\n\r\nAntimony may be precipitated in its metallic state from a hydrochloric\r\nacid solution, but it does not adhere very firmly to the electrode.\r\nIf potassium oxalate is added to a solution of the trichloride, the\r\nantimony may be readily reduced, but the metal adheres still less firmly\r\nto the electrode than it did in the first instance. An adherent coating\r\nmay be obtained by adding an alkaline tartrate, but in that case the\r\nseparation takes place too slowly. The precipitation of antimony may be\r\nvery readily effected from solutions of its sulpho salts.\r\n\r\nTo a liquid, which may contain free hydrochloric acid, hydrogen sulphide\r\nis added, then neutralized with ammonium hydrate, and saturated with\r\nammonium sulphide in excess. The reduction may be accelerated by the\r\naddition of some ammonium sulphate. The antimony separates out as a\r\nfine, light gray precipitate on the electrode, and which adheres very\r\nfirmly, provided the precipitation has not been carried on too rapidly,\r\n_i. e._, if the current employed for the reduction was not too strong.\r\n\r\nWhen the reduction has been completed, the supernatant liquid is poured\r\noff, and the residue washed in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF ARSENIC.\r\n\r\nArsenic cannot be completely separated from either its aqueous\r\nhydrochloric acid, or from a solution to which ammonium oxalate has been\r\nadded in excess. From its aqueous as well as from its oxalate solution,\r\na portion of the metal may be separated, but if the current is passed\r\nthrough its hydrochloric acid solution for a sufficient length of time,\r\nall the arsenic will be volatilized as arsenious hydride (AsH_3).\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF IRON FROM MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of ferric oxide and manganese ammonium oxalate is\r\nsubmitted to electrolysis, without the previous addition of ammonium\r\noxalate, the characteristic color of permanganic acid immediately makes\r\nits appearance, and the peroxide gradually precipitates itself on the\r\npositive, while the iron is deposited on the negative electrode. When\r\nthe examination is made in the above manner, it is impossible to\r\nseparate the two metals, for the peroxide will bring down with it a\r\nconsiderable quantity of ferric hydrate. The separation of the two\r\nmetals is only possible when the precipitation of the manganese peroxide\r\nis prevented, until the greater portion of the iron has been deposited.\r\nThis result may be attained by adding sodium phosphate, or, better\r\nstill, by the addition of ammonium oxalate in great excess. In both\r\ncases the characteristic coloration from permanganic acid is developed\r\nby the action of the current at the positive pole; this, however,\r\ndisappears in the direction of the negative electrode. After the greater\r\nportion of the ammonium oxalate has been converted into carbonate, the\r\ncoloration and necessarily the formation of manganese peroxide begins.\r\n\r\nAmmonium oxalate is added to the solution, and heat applied; then three\r\nor four grammes more of ammonium oxalate are dissolved in the liquid,\r\nwhich is then immediately submitted to electrolysis. When the amount of\r\nmanganese is small, the separation of the two elements takes place very\r\nrapidly, and the results are accurate. If the amount of manganese is\r\nmore than double that of iron, the separation of the latter will take a\r\nmuch longer time. Then, in order to effect a complete separation of the\r\ntwo elements, it is necessary to redissolve the deposited manganese in\r\noxalic acid (the acid is added, without interrupting the current, until\r\nthe liquid becomes red), and the current is allowed to continue its\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIt was found desirable, in effecting this separation, not to employ\r\ntoo strong a current (two Bunsen elements will suffice), and only\r\nto increase the strength of the current when it is necessary, in\r\nconsequence of a large amount of manganese being present, to redissolve\r\nthe peroxide.\r\n\r\nWhen the process is completed, it is not advisable to allow the current\r\nto act any longer, for otherwise some of the peroxide may adhere firmly\r\nto the iron, and the latter (after previously having poured off the\r\nliquid) must be redissolved in oxalic acid, that is to say, the\r\nelectrolysis must be repeated. As has been already mentioned in the\r\ndetermination of manganese as peroxide, its precipitation from ammonium\r\noxalate is not complete. The solution which contains the greater portion\r\nof manganese, suspended as peroxide, must first, therefore, be boiled to\r\ndecompose the ammonium carbonate; the remainder of the ammonium oxalate\r\nis neutralized with nitric acid, and the manganese converted into the\r\nsulphide by ammonium sulphide. The manganese sulphide is then ignited in\r\na current of hydrogen, and weighed as such.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF IRON AND ALUMINUM.\r\n\r\nThe quantitative separation of iron from aluminum, which presented many\r\ndifficulties according to the older methods, may be easily performed\r\nby electrolysis. If a solution of iron ammonium oxalate and aluminum\r\noxalate, to which an excess of ammonium oxalate has been added, be\r\nsubmitted to the action of the electric current, the iron will be\r\ndeposited as a firmly adhering coat on the negative electrode, while\r\nthe aluminum oxide remains in solution, just so long as the quantity\r\nof ammonium oxalate is in excess of the quantity of ammonium carbonate\r\nproduced. When, finally, a precipitation of aluminum oxide takes place\r\nthe liquid is almost free from iron. From time to time, the solution, in\r\nwhich the aluminum oxide is suspended, is tested for iron by ammonium\r\nsulphide, and the current is interrupted when no further reaction is\r\nobserved. The best method of procedure is to add ammonium oxalate in\r\nexcess to a neutral, a slightly acid solution, or to one which has been\r\nneutralized by the addition of ammonium hydrate (a hydrochloric acid\r\nsolution is not well adapted for this purpose); then as much more solid\r\nammonium oxalate is added until for every 0.1 gramme there is 2 to\r\n3 grammes of the oxalate present. The hot solution is then directly\r\nsubmitted to the action of the electric current. After the iron has been\r\nprecipitated, it is best to stop the action of the current before all\r\nthe aluminum oxide is thrown down, for otherwise a portion of the latter\r\nmay adhere firmly to the iron, and be difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, as was mentioned previously in the separation of iron\r\nfrom manganese, it is necessary to redissolve the iron (after previously\r\nhaving poured off the liquid) in oxalic acid, and then the electrolysis\r\nis continued.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect the complete precipitation of the aluminum oxide from\r\nthe solution which was poured from the iron, ammonium hydrate is added,\r\nand the solution boiled for some time, and then the aluminum oxide is\r\ndetermined in the usual manner. When the quantity of aluminum is less\r\nthan that of iron, this method may be relied upon to give exact results.\r\nWith the reverse (_i. e._, an excess of iron) the precipitate\r\nof aluminum oxide must be dissolved in oxalic acid (without the\r\ninterruption of the current), and the electrolysis continued.--_Berichte\r\nder Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft_, 14, 1662.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULTIVATION OF PYRETHRUM AND MANUFACTURE OF THE POWDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an announcement in the March number of the\r\n_Naturalist_, the editor of this department has sent out the seed of two\r\nspecies of pyrethrum, viz. _P. roseum_ and _P. cinerarioefolium_, to\r\na large number of correspondents in different parts of North America.\r\nEvery mail brings us some inquiries for further particulars and\r\ndirections to guide in the cultivation of the plant and preparation of\r\nthe powder. We have concluded, therefore, that such information as is\r\nobtainable on these heads will prove of public interest, and we shall\r\nask Professor Bessey's pardon for trenching somewhat on his domain.\r\n\r\nThere are very few data at hand concerning the discovery of the\r\ninsecticide properties of pyrethrum. The powder has been in use for many\r\nyears in Asiatic countries south of the Caucasus mountains. It was sold\r\nat a high price by the inhabitants, who successfully kept its nature a\r\nsecret until the beginning of this century, when an Armenian merchant,\r\nMr. Jumtikoff, learned that the powder was obtained from the dried\r\nand pulverized flower-heads of certain species of pyrethrum growing\r\nabundantly in the mountain region of what is now known as the Russian\r\nprovince of Transcaucasia. The son of Mr. Jumtikoff began the\r\nmanufacture of the article on a large scale in 1828, after which year\r\nthe pyrethrum industry steadily grew, until to-day the export of the\r\ndried flower-heads represents an important item in the revenue of those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nStill less seems to be known of the discovery and history of the\r\nDalmatian species of pyrethrum (_P. cinerarioefolum_), but it is\r\nprobable that its history is very similar to that of the Asiatic\r\nspecies. At the present time the pyrethrum flowers are considered by far\r\nthe most valuable product of the soil of Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nThere is also very little information published regarding either the\r\nmode of growth or the cultivation of pyrethrum plants in their native\r\nhome. As to the Caucasian species we have reasons to believe that they\r\nare not cultivated, at least not at the present time, statements to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Report Comm. of Patents, 1857, Agriculture, p. 130.]\r\n\r\nThe well-known Dr. Gustav Radde, director of the Imperial Museum of\r\nNatural History at Tiflis, Transcaucasia, who is the highest living\r\nauthority on everything pertaining to the natural history of that\r\nregion, wrote us recently as follows: \"The only species of its genus\r\n_Pyrethrum roseum_, which gives a good, effective insect powder, is\r\nnowhere cultivated, but grows wild in the basal-alpine zone of our\r\nmountains at an altitude of from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.\" From this it\r\nappears that this species, at least, is not cultivated in its native\r\nhome, and Dr. Radde's statement is corroborated by a communication of\r\nMr. S. M. Hutton, Vice-Consul General of the U. S. at Moscow, Russia, to\r\nwhom we applied for seed of this species. He writes that his agents were\r\nnot able to get more than about half a pound of the seed from any one\r\nperson. From this statement it may be inferred that the seeds have to be\r\ngathered from the wild and not from the cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nAs to the Dalmatian plant it is also said to be cultivated in its native\r\nhome, but we can get no definite information on this score, owing to the\r\nfact that the inhabitants are very unwilling to give any information\r\nregarding a plant the product of which they wish to monopolize. For\r\nsimilar reasons we have found great difficulty in obtaining even small\r\nquantities of the seed of _P. cinerarioefolium_ that was not baked or in\r\nother ways tampered with to prevent germination. Indeed, the people\r\nare so jealous of their plant that to send the seed out of the country\r\nbecomes a serious matter, in which life is risked. The seed of\r\n_Pyrethrum roseum_ is obtained with less difficulty, at least in small\r\nquantities, and it has even become an article of commerce, several\r\nnurserymen here, as well as in Europe, advertising it in their\r\ncatalogues. The species has been successfully grown as a garden plant\r\nfor its pale rose or bright pink flower-rays. Mr. Thomas Meehan, of\r\nGermantown, Pa., writes us: \"I have had a plant of _Pyrethrum roseum_ in\r\nmy herbaceous garden for many years past, and it holds its own without\r\nany care much better than many other things. I should say from this\r\nexperience that it was a plant which will very easily accommodate itself\r\nto culture anywhere in the United States.\" Peter Henderson, of New York,\r\nanother well-known and experienced nurseryman, writes: \"I have grown the\r\nplant and its varieties for ten years. It is of the easiest cultivation,\r\neither by seeds or divisions. It now ramifies into a great variety of\r\nall shades, from white to deep crimson, double and single, perfectly\r\nhardy here, and I think likely to be nearly everywhere on this\r\ncontinent.\" Dr. James C. Neal, of Archer, Fla., has also successfully\r\ngrown _P. roseum_ and many varieties thereof, and other correspondents\r\nreport similar favorable experience. None of them have found a special\r\nmode of cultivation necessary. In 1856 Mr. C. Willemot made a serious\r\nattempt to introduce and cultivate the plant[1] on a large scale in\r\nFrance. As his account of the cultivation of pyrethrum is the best\r\nwe know of we quote here his experience in full, with but few slight\r\nomissions: \"The soil best adapted to its culture should be composed of\r\npure ground, somewhat silicious and dry. Moisture and the presence of\r\nclay are injurious, the plant being extremely sensitive to an excess of\r\nwater, and would in such case immediately perish. A southern exposure is\r\nthe most favorable. The best time for putting the seeds in the ground is\r\nfrom March to April. It can be done even in the month of February if the\r\nweather will permit it. After the soil has been prepared and the seeds\r\nare sown they are covered by a stratum of ground mixed with some\r\nvegetable mould, when the roller is slightly applied to it. Every five\r\nor six days the watering is to be renewed, in order to facilitate the\r\ngermination. At the end of about thirty or forty days the young plants\r\nmake their appearance, and as soon as they have gained strength enough\r\nthey are transplanted at a distance of about six inches from each other.\r\nThree months after this operation they are transplanted again at a\r\ndistance of from fourteen to twenty inches, according to their strength.\r\nEach transplantation requires, of course, a new watering, which,\r\nhowever, should only be moderately applied. The blossoming of the\r\npyrethrum commences the second year, toward the end of May, and\r\ncontinues to the end of September.\" Mr. Willemot also states that the\r\nplant is very little sensitive to cold, and needs no shelter, even\r\nduring severe winters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Willemot calls his plant _Pyrèthre du Caucase (P.\r\nWillemoti._ Duchartre), but it is more than probable that this is only\r\na synonym of _P. roseum_. We have drawn liberally from Mr. Willemot's\r\npaper on the subject, a translation of which may be found in the Report\r\nof the Commissioner of Patents for the year 1861, Agriculture, pp.\r\n223-331.]\r\n\r\nThe above quoted directions have reference to the climate of France, and\r\nas the cultivation of the plant in many parts of North America is yet\r\nan experiment, a great deal of independent judgment must be used. The\r\nplants should be treated in the same manner as the ordinary Asters of\r\nthe garden or other perennial Compositae.\r\n\r\nAs to the Dalmatian plant, it is well known that Mr. G. N. Milco, a\r\nnative of Dalmatia, has of late years successfully cultivated _Pyrethrum\r\ncinerarioefolium_ near Stockton, Cal., and the powder from the\r\nCalifornia grown plants, to which Mr. Milco has given the name of\r\n\"Buhach,\" retains all the insecticide qualities and is far superior to\r\nmost of the imported powder, as we know from experience. Mr. Milco\r\ngives the following advice about planting--advice which applies more\r\nparticularly to the Pacific coast: \"Prepare a small bed of fine, loose,\r\nsandy, loamy soil, slightly mixed with fine manure. Mix the seed with\r\ndry sand and sow carefully on top of the bed. Then with a common rake\r\ndisturb the surface of the ground half an inch in depth. Sprinkle the\r\nbed every evening until sprouted; too much water will cause injury.\r\nAfter it is well sprouted, watering twice a week is sufficient. When\r\nabout a month old, weed carefully. They should be transplanted to loamy\r\nsoil during the rainy season of winter or spring.\"\r\n\r\nOur own experience with _P. roseum_ as well as _P. cinerarioefolium_\r\nin Washington, D. C., has been so far quite satisfactory. Some that we\r\nplanted last year in the fall came up quite well in the spring and will\r\nperhaps bloom the present year. The plants from sound seed which we\r\nplanted this spring are also doing finely, and as the soil is a rather\r\nstiff clay and the rains have been many and heavy, we conclude that Mr.\r\nWillemot has overstated the delicacy of the plants.\r\n\r\nIn regard to manufacturing the powder, the flower heads should be\r\ngathered during fine weather when they are about to open, or at the time\r\nwhen fertilization takes place, as the essential oil that gives the\r\ninsecticide qualities reaches, at this time, its greatest development.\r\nWhen the blossoming has ceased the stalks may be cut within about four\r\ninches from the ground and utilized, being ground and mixed with the\r\nflowers in the proportion of one-third of their weight. Great care must\r\nbe taken not to expose the flowers to moisture, or the rays of the sun,\r\nor still less to artificial heat. They should be dried under cover and\r\nhermetically closed up in sacks or other vessels to prevent untimely\r\npulverization. The finer the flower-heads are pulverized the more\r\neffectually the powder acts and the more economical in its use. Proper\r\npulverization in large quantities is best done by those who make a\r\nbusiness of it and have special mill facilities. Lehn & Fink, of New\r\nYork, have furnished us with the most satisfactory powder. For his own\r\nuse the farmer can pulverize smaller quantities by the simple method of\r\npounding the flowers in a mortar. It is necessary that the mortar be\r\nclosed, and a piece of leather through which the pestle moves, such\r\nas is generally used in pulverizing pharmaceutic substances in a\r\nlaboratory, will answer. The quantity to be pulverized should not exceed\r\none pound at a time, thus avoiding too high a degree of heat, which\r\nwould be injurious to the quality of the powder. The pulverization being\r\ndeemed sufficient, the substance is sifted through a silk sieve, and\r\nthen the remainder, with a new addition of flowers, is put in the mortar\r\nand pulverized again.\r\n\r\nThe best vessels for keeping the powder are fruit jars with patent\r\ncovers or any other perfectly tight glass vessel or tin box.--_American\r\nNaturalist_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMOVAL OF NOXIOUS VAPORS FROM ROASTING FURNACE GASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a paper read before the Aix-la-Chapelle section of the _Verein\r\ndeutscher Ingenieure_, Herr Robert Hasenclever presents a summary of\r\nthe results obtained with various methods for the absorption of the\r\nsulphurous acid generated during the roasting of zinc-blende and other\r\nsulphurets. Though most of our own metallurgical works are not so\r\nlocated as to be forced to pay much attention to the removal of noxious\r\nvapors, the efforts made abroad possess some interest for American\r\nmetallurgists. Besides containing sulphurous acid, the gases from the\r\nroasting furnaces hold varying quantities of sulphuric acid, and Dr.\r\nBernoulli describes a process applied on a large scale in Silesian zinc\r\nworks, where the gases were passed through towers filled with lime. It\r\nwas found that there was no trouble on account of the absorption of\r\ncarbonic acid by the lime, and that the latter acted very efficiently\r\nin reducing the quantity of sulphurous acid. Before entering the tower,\r\nthey contained 0.258 per cent. by volume of sulphurous acid and 2.45 per\r\ncent. of carbonic acid; while, after their passage through it, they\r\nheld 0.017 and 2.478 per cent, respectively. The process, however, is\r\ndeclared by Herr Hasenclever to be too costly for ordinary working,\r\nalthough he does not deny its value under special circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe removal of anhydrous sulphuric acid from the gases from\r\nroasting-furnaces has hitherto, as at the Waldmeister works, near\r\nStolberg, been effected by means of water trickling down in a tower\r\nfilled with coke, the gases entering below and moving upward. Herr\r\nHasenclever tested the Freytag method, in which the water is replaced\r\nby sulphuric acid, and obtained favorable results, as shown by the\r\nfollowing analyses of the gases before and after treatment. The figures\r\ngiven are grammes per 1,000 liters:\r\n\r\n   BEFORE.              AFTER.\r\n SO_2.   SO_3.       SO_2.

The amount of sulphuric acid charged per twenty-four\r\nhours was about 5,000 kilogrammes of 50 degrees Baumé, which flowed off\r\nwith a density of from 56 to 58 degrees Baumé. The quantity of acid\r\ncondensed varied according to the nature of the ores and the number of\r\nfurnaces working. It ranged between 300 and 1,000 kilogrammes of 60\r\ndegrees Baumé per twenty-four hours. The condensation of anhydrous\r\nsulphuric acid would pay, according to estimates submitted by Herr\r\nHasenclever; but to pass the gases through a tower filled with lime,\r\nin order to get rid of the remaining sulphurous acid, would prove too\r\nexpensive at Stolberg. An attempt to use milk of lime proved partially\r\nsuccessful; but it was not followed up, because it was decided to\r\nexperiment with the process suggested by Prof. Cl. Winkler, of Freiberg,\r\nwho proposes to pass the gases through a tower filled with iron in\r\nsome suitable shape, over which water trickles. From the solution thus\r\nobtained, sulphurous acid pure enough to be used for the manufacture\r\nof sulphuric acid, sulphur, and a solution of green vitriol is made.\r\nExperiments with this process are making at Freiberg and at the Rhenania\r\nWorks, near Stolberg. The trouble with the majority of methods thus\r\nfar is, that the draught of the furnaces is so much impeded by the\r\nabsorption towers that fans, blowers, or steam jets must be used to\r\ncarry the gases through it.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Herr Hasenclever has proved how difficult it is to\r\nfind a satisfactory means of removing the noxious vapors from furnace\r\ngases without incurring too serious an expense. Thus far the value of\r\nthe products obtained by absorption of sulphurous acid has not been\r\nequal to the cost of producing them. Herr C. Landsberg, who is general\r\nmanager of the Stolberg Company, has had similar experience, though his\r\nexperiments were made to test methods suggested at various times by Dr.\r\nE. Jacob and Dr. Aarland. Both are very ingenious, and were successful\r\non a small scale, but failed when tried in actual working.--_Engineering\r\nand Mining Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GAS EXHAUSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn common practice, the new exhauster at the Old Kent Road passes\r\nabout five million cubic feet of gas per day of twenty-four hours, and\r\nrequires the attention of two men and two boys for driving and stoking,\r\nat the following cost:\r\n\r\n                                     s.  d.\r\nWages--2 men,  at 5s. 6d             11  0\r\nWages--2 boys, at 3s. 6d              7  0\r\n                                     -----\r\n                                 £ 0 18  0\r\nOil, 1 gallon                      0  3  6\r\nWaste, 5 lb                        0  1  0\r\n                                  --------\r\nTotal                            £ 1  2  6\r\n\r\nfor five million cubic feet, or 0.054d. per 1,000 feet.

It\r\nhas proved itself so elegant and so convenient a vehicle for the\r\nadministration of various medicinal substances, is so easily miscible\r\nwith both water and alcohol, and is so pleasant to the taste, that it\r\nseems almost a wonder that it should have been so long in attaining the\r\nrank among the articles of the _Materia Medica_ which it now occupies.\r\nThe two manufactures, however, which seem to lead in the demand for\r\nglycerine are of nitro-glycerine and of oleomargarine.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which it is put for the former are well known, but precisely\r\nwhat the latter could want of the article is not, at first glance,\r\nquite so obvious. We are informed, however, that it is valued for its\r\nantiseptic properties, and also for its softening effect on the _quasi_\r\nbutter. Be this as it may, it seems that both here and in Europe the\r\nmakers of these two articles are buying largely of both crude and\r\nrefined glycerine.\r\n\r\nSo it appears that the willingness of the people to eat artificial\r\nbutter, and the progress in schemes for internal improvement, such as\r\nthe De Lesseps Canal, for instance, to say nothing of the European\r\nrevolutionists, are responsible to a great extent for the scarcity of an\r\nimportant article of pharmaceutical use.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while there is a notable increase in the demand for\r\nthe article, there is a gradual but very sure and noticeable falling off\r\nin the production.\r\n\r\nAt present the supply for the whole world comes from the candlemakers\r\nof Europe--chiefly France and Germany--and, as improved methods of\r\nillumination push candles out of the drawing rooms of the wealthier as\r\nwell as the cabins of the poor, and consequently out of the markets, the\r\nproduction of glycerine naturally grows less. In France, for instance,\r\ncandles are coming to be regarded among the wealthy chiefly as articles\r\nof luxury, and are lighted only for display at festivals of especial\r\nmagnificence and ceremony, while among the poor the kerosene lamp is\r\ncoming into almost as universal use as here.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the inexorable inn-keeper still keeps up, we believe, the\r\ninevitable _bougie_, but even that is fast becoming more of a fiction\r\nthan ever. Even in the churches, it is said, the use of candles is\r\ngradually falling off. To these causes must be attributed the decreasing\r\nsupply of the crude material, but it may be doubted whether this\r\ndecrease would be sufficient to materially affect the price for some\r\ntime to come were it not for the increased demand for the two industries\r\nto which we have alluded. Obviously, there must be found eventually some\r\nsubstitute for glycerine, or else some new source from which it may be\r\nprocured. The natural place to look for this would be in the waste\r\nlye from the soapmakers' boilers, but so far no one has succeeded in\r\nobtaining from this substance the glycerine it undoubtedly contains by\r\nany process sufficiently cheap to allow of its profitable employment.\r\n\r\nWe are assured by a veteran soap-boiler who has experimented much in\r\nthis direction that it is impossible to recover a marketable article of\r\nglycerine from the lees of soap in which resin is an ingredient. In his\r\nwords, it \"kills the glycerine,\" and, as none but a few of the finest\r\nsoaps are now made without resin, it would seem that the search for\r\nglycerine in this direction must be a hopeless one. It is a curious\r\ncommentary in the present state of affairs that previous to about 1857,\r\nwhen candles were largely manufactured in this country, there was little\r\nor no demand for glycerine, and millions of pounds of it were run\r\ninto the sewers. Even then, however, the use of it as a wholesome and\r\npleasant article of diet was known to the workmen employed in the candle\r\nfactories, who were accustomed to drink freely of the mingled glycerine\r\nand water which constituted the waste from the candles. Yet with this\r\nfact under their noses, as it were, it is only recently that members of\r\nthe medical profession have begun to recommend the same use of glycerine\r\nas a substitute for cod liver oil.--_Pharmacist_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF OILS, OR MIXTURES OF OILS, USED FOR LUBRICATING PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOils, fats, waxes, and bodies somewhat similar in nature, may--according\r\nto the substance of a paper recently read before the Chemical Society,\r\nby Mr. A. H. Allen, of Sheffield, and Mr. Thomson, of Manchester--be\r\ndivided into two great classes, viz., those which combine with soda,\r\npotash, or other alkalies to form soaps, and those which do not; and\r\nas those two classes of bodies differ materially in their actions on\r\nsubstances such as iron, copper, etc., with which they come in contact,\r\nit often becomes a question of great importance to the users of oils\r\nfor lubricating purposes to know what proportions of these different\r\nsubstances are contained in any oil or mixture of oils. The object of\r\nthe authors was to give accurate methods for determining the percentages\r\nof these bodies contained in any sample. Hydrocarbon or mineral oils are\r\nnow much used for lubricating the cylinders of engines, and especially\r\nof condensing engines, and that for two reasons--first, because they are\r\nneutral bodies, which have no action on metals; and, second, that they\r\nare not liable to deposit on the boilers, if they should happen to be\r\nintroduced with the condensed water so as to produce burning of the\r\nironwork over the flues.\r\n\r\nAnimal or vegetable oils or fats are composed of fatty acids in\r\ncombination with glycerine, and these, under the influence of\r\nhigh-pressure steam, are decomposed or dissociated, the fatty acids\r\nbeing liberated from the glycerine, leaving the former to act upon or\r\ncorrode the iron of the cylinder. But here their objectionable influence\r\ndoes not end. They form with the iron hard, insoluble compounds called\r\niron soaps, which increase the friction between the cylinder and piston,\r\nand in some cases gradually collect into the form of hard balls inside\r\nthe cylinder.\r\n\r\nWhen the water is used over and over again a considerable proportion of\r\nthe fatty acids of the oils used for lubricating the piston is carried\r\nover with the steam and is found in the condensed water which is\r\nintroduced into the boiler along with the water. Here it commences\r\naction, which proves quite as injurious to the boiler as it does to the\r\ncylinder, but in a different way. It acts upon the iron of the boiler\r\nand on some of the lime salts which constitute the incrustation, forming\r\ngreasy iron and lime soaps, which prevent the water from coming into\r\nabsolute contact with it. Thus the heat cannot be drawn away quickly\r\nenough by the water, and the plates thus coated above the flues are\r\nliable to become burdened and weakened. This action has in many cases\r\ngone on to such an extent that the flues have collapsed under the\r\npressure of the steam inside.\r\n\r\nThe authors give two different processes for the determination of animal\r\nor vegetable oils or fats and hydrocarbon or other neutral oils. They\r\ntake a certain weight of the sample and boil it with twice its weight\r\nof an eight per cent, solution of caustic soda in alcohol. The soda\r\ncombines with the fatty acids of the animal or vegetable oils forming\r\nsoaps; bicarbonate of soda is then added to neutralize the excess of\r\ncaustic soda; and, lastly, sand; and the whole is evaporated to dryness\r\nat the temperature of boiling water. The dry mixture is then transferred\r\nto a large glass tube, having a small hole in the bottom plugged with\r\nglass wool to act as a filter, and light petroleum spirit--which boils\r\nat about 150° to 180° Fahr.--is poured over it, till all the neutral or\r\nunsaponifiable oil is dissolved out. In the other process no sand is\r\nused, but the dry mixture is dissolved in water, and the soap solution\r\nwhich holds the neutral oils in solution is treated with ether, which\r\ndissolves out the neutral oil and then floats to the surface of the\r\nliquid. The ether solution is then drawn off, and the ether in the one\r\ncase and petroleum spirit in the other are separated from the dissolved\r\noils by distillation, the last traces of these volatile liquids being\r\nseparated by blowing a current of filtered air through the flask\r\ncontaining the neutral oil, which is then weighed and its percentage on\r\nthe original sample calculated.\r\n\r\nAll animal and vegetable oils yield a small quantity--about one per\r\ncent.--of unsaponifiable fatty matter, which must be deducted from the\r\nresult obtained. Sperm oil, however, was found to be an exception,\r\nbecause from its peculiar chemical constitution it yields nearly half\r\nits weight of a greasy substance to the ether or to the petroleum\r\nspirit. The substance, however, dissolved from sperm oil after\r\nsaponification has the appearance of jelly, when the ether or petroleum\r\nspirit solution is concentrated and allowed to cool, and the presence of\r\nsperm oil can thus be readily detected. Solid paraffin, heavy petroleum\r\nor paraffin oils, and rosin oil--which is produced by the destructive\r\ndistillation of rosin--are not saponifiable, and yield about the whole\r\nof the amount employed to the petroleum spirit or ether. Japan wax is\r\nalmost entirely saponifiable, while beeswax and spermaceti yield about\r\nhalf their weights to the petroleum spirit or ether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRITE OF AMYL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Edgar Kurtz, of Florence, has found this medicament so useful in the\r\nvarious aches and pains of every-day life that he has persuaded many\r\nfamilies of his acquaintance to keep it on hand as a domestic remedy. It\r\nis an excellent external application for stomach-ache, colic, tooth ache\r\n(whether nervous or arising from caries), neuralgia of the trigeminus,\r\nof the cervico-brachial plexus, etc. It is superior to anything else\r\nwhen inhaled in so-called angio-spastic hemicrania, giving rapid relief\r\nin the individual paroxysms and prolonging the intervals between the\r\nlatter. No trial was made in cases of angio paralytic hemicrania, since\r\nin this affection the drug would be physiologically contraindicated. It\r\nhas a very good effect in dysmenorrhoea, especially when occurring in\r\nchlorotic girls; in mild cases external applications suffice, otherwise\r\nthe drug should be inhaled (when complicated with inflammatory\r\nconditions of the uterus or appendages the results were doubtful or\r\nnegative). Its physiological action being that of a paralyzing agent of\r\nthe muscular tissue of the blood vessels, with consequent dilatation of\r\ntheir caliber (most marked in the upper half of the body), nitrite of\r\namyl is theoretically indicated in all conditions of cerebral anaemia.\r\nPractically it was found to be of much value in attacks of dizziness and\r\nfaintness occurring in anæmic individuals, as also in a fainting-fit\r\nfrom renal colic, and in several cases of collapse during anaesthesia by\r\nchloroform.\r\n\r\nIt has been recommended in asphyxia from drowning, hanging, and in\r\nasphyxia of the new born, but the first indication in these cases is the\r\ninduction of artificial respiration, after the successful initiation of\r\nwhich inhalations of nitrite of amyl doubtless assist in overcoming the\r\nconcomitant spasm of the smaller arteries.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important indications for the use of the drug is\r\nthreatening paralysis of the heart from insufficient compensation. In\r\nsuch cases it is necessary to gain time until digitalis and alcoholics\r\ncan unfold their action, and here nitrite of amyl stands pre-eminent. A\r\nsingle case in point will suffice to illustrate this. The patient was\r\nsuffering from mitral insufficiency, with irregular pulse, loss of\r\nappetite, enlargement of the liver, and mild jaundice. Temporary relief\r\nhad been several times afforded by infusion of digitalis. In February,\r\n1879, the condition of the patient suddenly became aggravated. The pulse\r\nbecame very irregular and intermittent. The condition described as\r\ndelirium cordis presented itself, together with epigastric pulsation\r\nand vomiting. Vigorous counter-irritation, by means of hot bottles\r\nand sinapisms to the extremities, etc., proved useless. Digitalis and\r\nchampagne, when administered, were immediately vomited. The pulse ran up\r\nfrom seventy until it could no longer be counted at the wrist, while\r\nthe beats of the heart increased to one hundred and twenty and more per\r\nminute. The extremities grew cold, and the face became covered with\r\nperspiration. The urine was highly albuminous. Nitrite of amyl was then\r\nadministered by inhalation: at first, three to five drops; then, ten to\r\ntwenty; and finally, more or less was poured on the handkerchief without\r\nbeing measured. During each inhalation the condition of the patient\r\nrapidly improved, but as quickly grew worse, so that the drug was\r\ncontinued at short intervals all night, ten grammes in all having been\r\nused. In the morning the patient was better, and 0.5 gramme of digitalis\r\nwas then given in infusion per rectum, and repeated on the following\r\nday, after which the patient remained comparatively well until a year\r\nand a half later, when a second attack of the kind just described was\r\nquickly cut short by similar treatment.\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy case was that of a robust man of thirty years, who\r\nwas attacked with acute gastro intestinal catarrh. The patient had\r\nas many as one hundred watery evacuations in forty-eight hours, with\r\nfainting fits, violent cramps in the calves of the legs, two attacks\r\nof general convulsions--in short, he presented the picture of a person\r\nattacked with cholera. Opium, champagne, hypodermic injections of\r\nsulphuric ether, counter-irritation, etc., proved useless. The doctor\r\nwas on the point of injecting dilute liquor ammonii into the veins, but,\r\nnone being obtainable, it occurred to him to try nitrite of amyl as a\r\nlast resort. A considerable amount was poured on a handkerchief and held\r\nbefore the patient's mouth and nose, while the legs were also rubbed\r\nenergetically with the same agent. Respiration soon became deeper and\r\nmore regular, while the pulse gradually returned at the wrist. These\r\nprocedures were repeated again and again, without regard to the quantity\r\nof the drug used, as soon as the radial pulse became weaker, and kept\r\nup until the patient complained of a sense of fullness in the head, and\r\nrequested the discontinuance of the drug. The evacuations became less\r\nfrequent, and in a week the patient was able to be up. Resuming then,\r\nKurz concludes that nitrite of amyl is indicated in cardiac affections\r\nwhen the capillary circulation is obstructed and the cardiac muscle is\r\nthreatened with paralysis from overwork; further, in cases of impeded\r\ncirculation occasioned by cholera or severe diarrhea, particularly in\r\nthe so-called hydrocephaloid (false hydrocephalus) of children. It\r\nis worthy of trial in tetanic and eclamptic seizures, and in tonic\r\nangiospasms such as occur during the chill of malarial fevers, although\r\nin the last-mentioned condition pilocarpine is perhaps more suitable,\r\nprovided the energy of the heart be unimpaired.\r\n\r\nAs regards the dose, Kurz's experience demonstrates that we need not\r\nrestrict ourselves to a few drops. The quantity may be increased, if\r\nnecessary, until symptoms of cerebral congestion show themselves, when\r\nthe drug should be momentarily or permanently discontinued. Usually from\r\nthree to five or ten drops are sufficient, sometimes even less. Kurz has\r\nmet with no unpleasant consequences, much less serious complications,\r\nfrom the application of nitrite of amyl. But the drug is contraindicated\r\nin cases associated with cerebral hyperaemia, in atheromatous conditions\r\nof the arteries, and in the so-called plethoric state--_Beta's\r\nMemoabilien, March 24, 1881_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\nBy ALFRED STILLÉ, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of simple acute articular rheumatism may be abandoned to\r\npalliatives and nature. Apart from complications, such cases nearly\r\nalways recover under rest and careful nursing. Try and disabuse\r\nyourselves of the idea that their cure is dependent upon medicines\r\nalone; to help nature is often the best we can do. No treatment was ever\r\ninvented which stopped a case of acute articular rheumatism. It cannot\r\nbe stopped by bleeding, or sweating, or purging, by niter, by tartar\r\nemetic, by guaiacum, by alkalies, by salines, by salicylic acid, or by\r\nanything else. The physician can palliate the pain and perhaps shorten\r\nthe attack, can control and perhaps prevent complications and stiffness\r\nof the joints, but he cannot arrest the disease. Where rest, proper\r\ndiet, and warmth are enjoined, most cases will get well just as soon\r\nwithout as with the use of medicinal methods. Dr. Austin Flint, Sr.,\r\nof New York, in support of this statement, subjected some patients, a\r\nnumber of years ago, to the expectant treatment, and found that they\r\nmade just as rapid and just as complete recoveries as did those cases\r\nunder the most active medication. Purgatives have been used in all ages\r\nin the treatment of this disease, because it was thought to be a fever.\r\nWe are all but too ready to put our necks into the yoke of a theory. In\r\nold times they thought that the system ought to be reduced. Before the\r\ntime of purgatives depletion was employed. This mode of treatment I will\r\nnot even discuss. There is no evidence of which I am cognizant in favor\r\nof purgatives. There are very good reasons indeed why they should not be\r\nused: (1) Because they cannot possibly cure; (2) because they oblige the\r\npatient to make painful movements; and (3) because they expose him to\r\nthe dangers of cold. A celebrated London physician had all his patients\r\npacked in blankets, and did not allow them to move a finger. This was\r\ngoing to the other extreme. There are certain cases in which purgatives\r\nare alleged to be of use, viz.: Those in which the bowels are\r\nconstipated, and there is a bitter taste in the mouth. I have never seen\r\nsuch cases except in habitual drunkards, and in such cases a purgative\r\ndoes more harm than allowing the effete matter to remain in the system.\r\nOpium was once vaunted as a specific, and it was claimed that it\r\ndiminished the tendency to complications in the course of the disease.\r\nDr. Corrigan, of Dublin, said that large doses of opium were well\r\nborne--say from four to twelve grains in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours, or sometimes he advised giving as much as one grain every hour.\r\nOpium so employed does not produce narcotism, and does not constipate\r\nthe bowels. More recent experience has shown that opium, of all\r\nremedies, is the most likely to cause heart complications. Some have\r\nrecommended colchicum, arguing that because it does good in gout, it\r\nmust, therefore, do good in rheumatism. But colchicum is not a remedy\r\nfor rheumatism. Many years ago it was very much the custom to administer\r\nlarge doses of powdered Peruvian bark. The rationale of these large\r\ndoses was founded upon their sedative effect. Haygrath, Morton,\r\nHeberden, and Fothergill were the first to employ this method. Later\r\nstill, a number of noted French physicians, among them Briquet, Andral,\r\nMonerat, and Legroux, renewed the use of this medicine in the form of\r\nquinia, but gave it in smaller doses, seeking only its tonic effect,\r\nfrom five to fifteen grains being administered in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then it was still continued in smaller doses.\r\nStill more recently, quinia taking the place of Peruvian bark, the old\r\nplan of administering large doses has been resumed. From thirty all the\r\nway up to one hundred grains have been administered in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours. Never was there a more profligate waste of a precious\r\nmedicine. Even the physicians who so used it were obliged to acknowledge\r\nthat it only did good in sub-acute and mild cases. I believe that it has\r\nalso been fashionable in the so called cases of hyperpyrexia to immerse\r\nthe patient in a bath varying in temperature from 60° to 98° Fahr.\r\nAlthough patients thus treated sometimes recovered, they also sometimes\r\nperished from congestion of the lungs and brain.\r\n\r\nAmong cardiac and nervous sedatives, digitalis, veratrum album and\r\nviride, veratria and aconite, have each, at one time or other, been\r\nemployed indiscriminately. Such treatment, of course, has only proven\r\nitself to be a monument of rashness to those who employed it. Such\r\nsedatives may reduce the pulse, but do not shorten the disease. Indeed,\r\nif it is possible to prove the absurdity of anything more clearly by\r\nmere enumeration of these medicines as cures for rheumatism, I do not\r\nknow of it. Do digitalis and aconite act in the same manner? This is\r\njust one expression of the folly which surrounded the use of digitalis\r\nat the time of its discovery. Then every affection of the heart was\r\ntreated with digitalis.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years new remedies have been proclaimed in the shape\r\nof salicylic acid and its sodium salt. I confess that I possess no\r\npersonal knowledge of their use in this disease, for I was at first\r\ndissuaded from employing them by a prejudice against the grounds on\r\nwhich they were recommended, and more recently by the contradictory\r\njudgments respecting them, and the unquestionable mischief they have\r\nsometimes caused. According to their eulogists, the arrest of the\r\ndisease is secured by them within four or five days, whether the attack\r\nbe febrile or not; its mortality was diminished; relapses do not occur\r\nif the medicine is continued until full convalescence; it is without\r\ninfluence on the heart complications already existing, but it tends\r\nto prevent them as well as other serious inflammations. One of these\r\ngentlemen assures us that to say it far excels any other method of\r\ntreatment would be to give it but scant praise. But, upon the other\r\nhand, it is accused of producing disorders, and even grave accidents in\r\nalmost all the functions of the economy. In some cases it has produced\r\nringing in the ears or deafness, or a rapid pulse, or an excessively\r\nhigh temperature, panting respiration, profuse perspiration,\r\nalbuminuria, delirium, and imminent collapse. In one published case this\r\nanti-pyretic did not lower, but, on the contrary, seemed actually to\r\nraise the temperature so high that immediately after death it stood at\r\n110° F. Many, very many, analogous cases have been published. I repeat,\r\ntherefore, that I am personally unacquainted with the effects of this\r\nmedicine in acute articular rheumatism, and that I have not thus far\r\nbeen tempted to employ it.\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to see the connection between blisters and alkalies\r\nin their power to influence the course of acute articular rheumatism,\r\nand yet it is certain that they do so influence it, and in the same way,\r\n_i. e._, by altering the condition of the blood from acid to alkaline.\r\nIf you ask me to explain to you how blisters act in this way I am\r\nobliged to confess my ignorance. To produce this result they must be\r\napplied over all the affected joints. Experience, if not science, has\r\ndecided conclusively in their favor. They do effect a cessation of the\r\nlocal symptoms, render the urine alkaline, and diminish the amount of\r\nfibrin in the blood.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a consideration of the use of alkalies. Alkalies\r\nneutralize the acids, act as diuretics, and eliminate the _materies\r\nmorbi_. Alone, and in small doses, they are unable to influence the\r\ncourse of the disease; but when given in very large doses their effects\r\nare marvelous; the pulse falls, the urine is increased in quantity and\r\nbecomes alkaline, and the inflammation subsides. The symptoms of the\r\ndisease are moderated, the duration of the attack is shortened, and the\r\ncardiac complications are prevented. The dose of the alkalies must\r\nbe increased until the acid secretions are neutralized. A very good\r\ncombination of these remedies is the following:\r\n\r\nRx. Sodae bicarb              3 iss.\r\n    Potas. acet               3 ss.\r\n    Acid. cit              f. 3 ss.\r\n    Aquae                  f. 3 ij. [1]\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: Could also be '2/3 ij.']\r\n\r\nS. This dose should be repeated every three or four hours, until the\r\nurine becomes alkaline. On the subsidence of the active symptoms two\r\ngrains of quinine may be added with advantage to each dose. The alkalies\r\nmust be gradually discontinued, but the quinia continued. The diet\r\nshould consist of beef tea or broth, with bread and milk; no solid food\r\nshould be allowed. Woolen cloths, moistened with alkaline solutions, may\r\nwith advantage be applied to the affected joints. To these laudanum\r\nmay be added for its anodyne effect. The patient must be sedulously\r\nprotected from vicissitudes of the temperature and be in bed between\r\nblankets. The alkaline treatment relieves the pain, abates the fever,\r\nand saves the heart by lessening the amount of fibrin in the blood. A\r\nlong time ago Dr. Owen Rees, of London, introduced the use of lemon\r\njuice. This remedy was thought to convert uric acid into urea, and to\r\nso help elimination. Though the treatment is practically correct, the\r\ntheory of it is all wrong. Lemon juice does good in mild cases, but\r\ncannot be relied upon in severe attacks. During the febrile stage of\r\nacute articular rheumatism the diet should consist mainly of farinaceous\r\nand mucilaginous preparations, with lemonade and carbonic acid water as\r\ndrinks. The cloths applied to the joints should be changed when they\r\nbecome saturated with sweat, and in changing them the patient should be\r\nprotected from the air. The sweating may be controlled by small doses\r\nof atropia, from the one-sixtieth to the one-thirtieth of a grain. To\r\nprevent subsequent stiffness the joints should be bathed with warm oil\r\nand chloroform, and wrapped in flannel cloths. In the proper season this\r\ncondition is very well treated by sea-bathing. There is no specific plan\r\nof treatment in acute articular rheumatism. The treatment pursued\r\nmust vary according to the intensity of the inflammation and the\r\npeculiarities of the patients.--_Medical Gazette_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD IN MADNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo psychologist has hitherto been able, and probably it is impossible,\r\nto define _madness_, or to give a clearly marked indication of the\r\nboundary line between sanity and insanity. Mental soundness is merged\r\nin unsoundness by degrees of decadence which are so small as to be\r\npractically inappreciable. It is with the mind-state which precedes the\r\ndevelopment of recognized form of insanity the therapeutist and the\r\nsocial philosopher are chiefly interested. Although in individual cases\r\nthe subject of mental derangement may, as the phrase runs, \"go mad\"\r\nsuddenly, speaking generally insanity is a symptom occurring in the\r\ncourse of disease, and, commonly, not until the malady of which it is\r\nthe expression has made some progress. Those mental disturbances which\r\nconsist in a temporary aberration of brain function, and which are the\r\naccidents of instability, rather than the effects of developed or even\r\ndeveloping neuroses, can scarcely be classed as insanity; although it is\r\ntrue, and in an important sense, that these passing storms of excitement\r\nor spells of moody depression may--acting reflexly on the cerebral and\r\nnervous centers, as all mind-states and mind-movements react--exert a\r\nmorbific influence and lay the physical bases of mental disease. The\r\nconsideration most practical to the community and germane to the\r\nquestion of public safety is, that in any and every population there\r\nmust exist a dangerously large proportion of persons who are always in\r\na condition of mind to be injuriously influenced by any force which\r\npowerfully affects them. As a matter of history, it would seem that the\r\nmajority of such persons are controlled rather than morbidly excited by\r\nthe opportunity of throwing themselves into any popular movement. They\r\nmay suffer afterward for the stimulation they receive at the time of\r\npublic commotions, but while these are in progress they link their own\r\nconsciousness with that of other minds, and the tendency to develop\r\nindividual eccentricities of mental action is thereby for the moment\r\nrepressed or exhausted. It is in the intervals of great public\r\nexcitement the peace is disturbed by the vagaries of criminals who are\r\nmore or less reasonably suspected of being \"insane.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be premature to assume that the murderer of Mr. Gold, or the\r\nman who attempted to assassinate the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, is insane. There are circumstances in connection with each of\r\nthese tragedies which must suggest the reflection that the assailants\r\nwere possibly, or even probably, of unsound mind. We do not, however,\r\npropose to discuss these features of the respective cases at this\r\njuncture. The full facts are not, as yet, ascertained; but enough is\r\nknown to warrant an endeavor to clear the way for future remark by\r\ndisposing of the objection that the suspected perpetrator of the\r\nBrighton outrage and the would-be assassin of the President both showed\r\n\"forethought\" and \"method.\" It is a common formula for the expression of\r\ndoubt as to the irresponsibility of an alleged lunatic, that there is\r\n\"method in his madness.\" Nothing can be farther from the truth than the\r\ninference to which this observation is intended to point. It is not in\r\nthe least degree necessary that a madman should be unconscious of the\r\nact he performs, or of its nature as a violation of the law of God\r\nor man; nor is it necessary that he should do the deed under an\r\nungovernable impulse, or at the supposed bidding of God or devil, angel\r\nor fiend. The forms of mental disease to which these presumptions apply\r\nare coarse developments of insanity. Dr. Prichard was among the first of\r\nEnglish medico-psychologists to recognize the existence of a more subtle\r\nform of disease, which he termed \"moral insanity.\" Herbert Spencer\r\nsupplied the key-note to this mystery of madness when he propounded the\r\ndoctrine of \"dissolution;\" and Dr. Hughlings Jackson has since applied\r\nthat hypothesis to the elucidation of morbid mental states and their\r\ncorrelated phenomena. When disorganizing--or, if we may borrow\r\nan expression from the terminology of geological science,\r\n_denuding_--disease attacks the mental organism, it, so to say, strips\r\noff, layer by layer, the successive strata of \"habit,\" \"principle,\" and\r\n\"nature,\" which compose the character. First in order go the higher\r\nmoral qualities of the mind; next those which are the result of\r\npersonally formed habits; then the inherited principles of personal and\r\nsocial life; at length the polish which civilization gives to humanity\r\nis lost, and in the process of denudation the evolutionary elements of\r\nman's nature are progressively destroyed, until he is reduced to the\r\nlevel of a creature inspired by purely animal passions, and obeying the\r\nlower brutish instincts. The term \"moral insanity\" is accurate as far\r\nas it goes, but it expresses only the first stage in a process of\r\ndissolution which is essentially the same throughout, but which has\r\nunfortunately received different designations as its several features\r\nhave been recognized and studied apart. The difference between the\r\nsubject of \"moral insanity\" and the general paralytic, who has lost all\r\nsense of decency and lives the life of a beast, is one of degree. The\r\npractical difficulty is to convince the mere observer that forms of\r\ninsanity which seem to consist in the loss of moral qualities and\r\nprinciples _only_, may be as directly the effect of brain disease as any\r\nof those grosser varieties of mental disorder which he is perfectly well\r\nable to recognize, and fully prepared to ascribe to their proper cause.\r\n\r\nTo the professional mind, at least, it will follow from what we have\r\nsaid that the injury to mind properties or qualities inflicted by the\r\ninvasion of disease may be partial, and must in every case be determined\r\nby laws or conditions governing the progress of disease, perhaps on\r\nthe lines and in the directions which have been least well guarded by\r\neducationary influences. A man may lose his faculty of forming a wise\r\njudgment long before he is deprived of the power of distinguishing\r\nbetween right and wrong. This is so because it is a higher attainment in\r\nmoral culture to do right advisedly, than simply to perceive the right\r\nthing to do. The application of principle to conduct is an advance on\r\nthe mere recognition of virtue in the concrete, or even the possession\r\nof virtue in the abstract. The question whether any past act of\r\nwrongdoing was an act of insanity does not so much depend upon the great\r\nquestion whether the person doing it was insane as a whole being, or\r\nwhether the deed done was the outcome of passion or error, the direct\r\nfruit of limited or special disease. In short, the insanity of the act\r\nmust be inferred from the morbid condition of the brain from which it\r\nsprang, rather than from the act itself. A partially disorganized--or as\r\nwe prefer to say \"denuded\"--brain may be fully capable of sane thought,\r\nexcept on some one topic, and able to exercise every intellectual\r\nfunction except of a particular order. Or there may be mental weakness\r\nand neurotic susceptibility in regard to a special class of impressions.\r\nIt would be difficult to name any form of act or submission which may\r\nnot be the outcome of incipient or limited disease. The practical\r\ndifficulty is to avoid, on the other hand, treating the fruits of\r\ndisease as willful offenses; while, on the other, we do not allow the\r\nsupposition or presumption of disease to be employed as an excuse for\r\nwrongdoing. It is, of course, clear that there may be perfect method in\r\nsuch madness as springs from partial or commencing brain disease; for\r\nevery element in the mental process which culminates in a mad act may be\r\nsane except the inception of the idea in which the act took its rise.\r\nThus, in the case of the suspected murderer of Mr. Gold, there may have\r\nbeen perfect sanity in respect to every stage of the process by which\r\nthe crime was planned and carried out, and yet insanity, the effect of\r\nbrain disease, in the idea by which the deed was suggested. For example,\r\nwhen a man is suffering from morbid suspicion, and, fixing his distrust\r\non some individual, purposes to murder him, the intellectual processes\r\nby which he lays his plans and fulfills his morbidly conceived\r\nintention, are performed with perfect sanity, as by a sane will. It is\r\nimportant to recognize this. There is no difference in _nature_ between\r\nthe mental operation by which a \"sane\" man contrives and executes a\r\ncrime, and that by which a known \"lunatic\" will commit the like offense.\r\nThere may be as much _method_ in the one instance as in the other, and\r\nthe faculties which exhibit this method may be as sound and effective,\r\nbut in the one case the idea behind the act is sane, while in the other\r\nit is insane. The brain is not one large homogeneous organ to be\r\nhealthy or diseased, orderly or deranged, throughout at any one period.\r\nInflammations, and diseases generally, which affect the brain as a whole\r\ndo not commonly cause insanity properly so called. The organ of the\r\nmind is a composite, or aggregate of cells, or molecules, any number\r\nor series of which may be affected with disease while the rest remain\r\nhealthy. At present we are only on the threshold of investigation\r\nconcerning the physical causes of insanity, and have scarcely done more\r\nthan recognize the possibility of _molecular_ disease of the brain.\r\nHereafter science will, probably, succeed in unveiling the obscure facts\r\nof molecular brain pathology, and enable the medical psychologist to\r\npredicate disease of recognized classes of brain elements from the\r\nspecial phenomena of mind disturbance. This is the line of inquiry, and\r\nthe result, to which the progress already made distinctly tends. For the\r\npresent, the inferences we can surely draw from known facts are\r\nvery few; but prominent among the number are certain which it is\r\nall-important to recognize in view of the judgment which must hereafter\r\nbe formed on the two cases now engaging public attention on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic. The existence of method in madness is no marvel, and\r\nthat characteristic cannot therefore be supposed, or alleged, to weigh\r\nas evidence against the \"insanity\" of the criminal. The perpetrators of\r\nthese heinous offenses against common right and public safety may be\r\nmore or less responsible for their acts, and, so far as these are\r\nconcerned, more or less sane or insane. The measure of the morbid\r\nelement in their individual cases will be the health or disease of the\r\nparticular part or element of the brain from which the offense sprang.\r\nThe ultimate judgment formed must be determined upon the basis of\r\nscientific tests to be applied to the action of the brain alleged to be\r\nthe subject of partial or incipient disease. There is nothing in the\r\nfacts as they stand to supply the materials for a judgment. Precise\r\nscientific inquiry can alone solve the enigma each case presents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE METHODS TO STAUNCH ACCIDENTAL HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nBy EDWARD BORCK, M.D., St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems almost superfluous to write or say a word about\r\nany method of arresting hemorrhage from wounds; for the practitioner,\r\nas a rule, is well acquainted with all the different manipulations and\r\nappliances for the purpose, and enough may be obtained from the text\r\nbooks. Nevertheless, to call attention to some useful, or old, or\r\napparently forgotten matter occasionally, seems not to be amiss, for it\r\nrefreshes our memory, stimulates us to think about and keeps before\r\nour eyes important subjects. A few hints on the above, I hope, will\r\ntherefore be well received.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of hemorrhage, viz., the arresting of the same from open\r\nwounds, is not only important to the surgeon as the basis of surgery,\r\nbut it is also of great importance to the laity, and especially to\r\nthose workmen who are perpetually in danger of being injured. It is\r\nastonishing how unknowing the people seem to be, with any method to\r\ncheck bleeding from a wound temporarily; even the most simple method of\r\npressure is in the majority of such accidents not resorted to. The sight\r\nof a little blood does not alone upset a timid, nervous woman, but many\r\ntimes the strongest of men; and why? because it naturally creates a\r\nfeeling of awe and detestation. If a person is wounded by a machine, or\r\notherwise, a crowd of all his fellow workmen gather around him, and look\r\non the poor fellow bleeding; half a dozen or more will start out on a\r\nrun in different directions to hunt a doctor, or some old woman who has\r\na reputation for stopping bleeding by sympathy, either of whom they are\r\nlikely to find \"not at home.\" In the meantime the vital fluid trickles\r\naway; nobody knows what to do; everybody does something, but none the\r\nright thing. Now, it is true, it does not often happen that any one\r\nbleeds to death, wise mother nature, as a rule, coming to their\r\nassistance, especially in lacerated wounds; but the anemic condition\r\nproduced by excessive loss of blood is followed by severe consequences,\r\nand is to be dreaded, for it retards recovery. To save all the blood\r\npossible ought to be apprehended as an important matter by every one.\r\n\r\nHardly a week passes that some unfortunate is not brought to my office,\r\nwho has been badly injured in some way; he has been bleeding, perhaps,\r\nthe distance of several blocks, and arrives almost faint. In the most of\r\nsuch cases they have something tied around their wounds, but hardly ever\r\nin any manner so as to be equal to stop the bleeding. In exceptional\r\ncases you find a tourniquet or the Spanish windlass applied. This,\r\nwhen applied by a surgeon, may answer very well, but when applied by a\r\nnon-professional person it is invariably screwed up so tight that the\r\npain produced thereby is so great and intolerable that the patient\r\nprefers rather to bleed to death. This is a great objection.\r\n\r\nTherefore I will call attention to the method of forcible flexion; and\r\nthough extreme flexion has been practiced by surgeons in isolated cases,\r\nstill to Professor Adelman, of Dorpat, is due the credit of first having\r\nsystematized the following method:\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE UPPER ARM (ART. BRACHIALIS).\r\n\r\nBring the elbows of the patient as near as possible together upon the\r\nback, and fasten them with a bandage. From this point let a doppelt\r\nbandage pass down to and over the perineum; separate the bandages again\r\nin front, let one end run over the left, the other over the right groin\r\nback again to the elbows (see Fig. 1)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n\"The illustrations will explain at a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE ARTERIES IN THE UPPER THIRD OF THE ARM.\r\n\r\nAcute flexion of the elbow, simple bending of the forearm upon the upper\r\narm, will suffice. But if there is bleeding from the arteries near the\r\njoint of the hand or from any part of the hand, then the hand must also\r\nbe brought into flexion, and secured by a bandage. (See Fig. 2.) The\r\nbandage must always be wrapped around the wound first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE THIGH (ART. FEMORALIS).\r\n\r\nIt needs no other explanation, as Fig. 3 shows the mode of stopping the\r\nhemorrhage from that region temporarily.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the front part of the leg (Art.

Tibiailis Post, et\r\nPeronea) same as above, with the addition of a tampon or compress under\r\nthe knee joint, or like Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE FOOT (ART. PLANTARIS ET DORSALIS PEDIS).\r\n\r\nFlexion of the leg upon the thigh, and flexion of the foot upon the\r\nfront of the tibia.\r\n\r\nObjections might also be raised to the above method on account of the\r\npain which it may produce; but the flexion never needs to be so forced\r\nas to be unendurable to the patient; the position may be a little\r\nuncomfortable to a very sensitive person, that is all. Furthermore, it\r\nhas been proven that a limb can be kept in a flexed position for several\r\ndays, \"nine by some authors,\" without any injury, and with a complete\r\nclosure of the arteries. We do not expect, however, that this method of\r\narresting hemorrhage will ever be adopted as \"the\" method in surgery,\r\nneither will it be necessary here to point out any cases where the\r\npractitioner can have and under certain circumstances be obliged to have\r\nto resort to this simple method. Military surgeons may also profit by\r\nit, for it is certainly a valuable and admirable mode, and so easily\r\napplied in cases of emergency by any one, if the unfortunate should be\r\ndistant from surgical aid. I also believe that it would be advisable and\r\ncertainly humane, to instruct the people in general, by popular lectures\r\nor through the press, the manner of stopping hemorrhage temporarily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest of all methods, however, to arrest hemorrhage is the\r\nrubber bandage. It has displaced in surgery the old tourniquet almost\r\ncompletely, which required a certain skill and anatomical knowledge to\r\napply it; not necessarily so with the rubber bandage. Any one can apply\r\nit, for the amount of pressure needed to arrest the hemorrhage from a\r\nwound suggests itself. The rubber bandage produces but little pain; the\r\npatient is comparatively comfortable and out of immediate danger and\r\nanxiety; while in the meantime the proper attention can be secured.\r\n\r\nI think it would be well if our health officers would direct their\r\nattention a little to the accidental hemorrhages, and if they do not\r\npossess the power, to refer the matter to the proper tribunal to enact\r\na law that would compel all owners and corporations of factories, saw,\r\nplaning, and rolling mills, and, in fact, every establishment where\r\nthe laborers are constantly in danger of accidents, to keep on hand a\r\ncertain number of strong rubber bandages, according to the number of\r\nmen employed, and that at least several of the men, if not all in every\r\nestablishment of that kind, be instructed in the application of the\r\nbandage. Steamboats and other vessels should carry a supply, and\r\nrailroad companies should be obliged to furnish all watchmen along their\r\nrespective roads with rubber bandages, and see that the men know how to\r\nuse them in case an accident should occur. Every train that goes out\r\nshould have some bandages on board in care of some employe, who knows\r\nhow to handle them when needed. Many pounds of precious blood may thus\r\nbe saved, and danger to life from this cause be averted.--_Indiana\r\nMedical Reporter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT WATER COMPRESSES IN TETANUS AND TRISMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSporer has successfully treated cases of tetanus by merely applying to\r\nthe nape of the neck and along the spine large pieces of flannel dipped\r\nin hot water, of a temperature just bearable to the hand (50-55°\r\nC.).--_Allg. med. cent.

By nine o'clock, the time appointed for beginning operations,\r\nthere was a very large number of gentlemen interested in these trials\r\nalready collected on the farm of Mr. Hall, at Thulston, and the\r\ndistances that many of them had come testified to the importance of the\r\ninterests involved. The morning was perfect for reaping, though\r\nominous clouds in the southwest led many to hazard conjectures, which\r\nunfortunately turned out too well founded, that the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety would not on this occasion escape the fate which had visited\r\nthem so often. The corn stood ripe and upright in the various plots into\r\nwhich the fields had been divided, and the ground was level and dry. The\r\npublished list of the competitors contained twenty entries, not by as\r\nmany firms, however, for many names appeared more than once; but the\r\nrules of the society, which objects to different machines being used for\r\ndifferent kinds of corn in these trials, together with non-attendance\r\nfor unknown reasons, had reduced the actual list of competing machines\r\nto seven. These were as follows: Mr. W. A. Wood, the McCormick\r\nHarvesting Machine Company, the Johnston Harvester Company, Messrs.\r\nSamuelson & Company, Messrs. J. & F. Howard, Messrs. Aultman & Company,\r\nand Mr. H.J.H. King. All these machines were to be seen at the show,\r\nexcept the second named, which was delayed by the stranding of\r\nthe steamship Britannic, and had only lately arrived in rather a\r\nweather-beaten condition. The trials were to be made upon oats, barley,\r\nand wheat, and the plots for the preliminary trials were about half an\r\nacre in extent. Shortly after half-past nine o'clock, the judges and\r\nengineers of the society having arrived upon the ground, a start was\r\nmade upon the oats by the three machines belonging to Mr. Wood, Messrs.\r\nSamuelson & Co., and the Johnston Harvester Company. It should, perhaps,\r\nbe mentioned that the strength of this crop of oats varied a good deal\r\nin different parts of the field. These three machines all belong to the\r\nclass which has the automatic trip--that is, the binding gear is thrown\r\ninto action by the pressure of the straw accumulated arriving at a\r\ncertain value, independently of any special action on the part of the\r\ndriver. The sheaves from Messrs. Samuelson's machines were extremely\r\nneat and well separated from each other, a point to which farmers attach\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that it is impossible to secure the binding of every\r\nsingle sheaf. Here and there, even with the best binders, an occasional\r\nmiss will occur, in which the corn is thrown out unbound. However, with\r\nMessrs Samuelson's machine this was extremely rare, and the neatness of\r\nthe sheaves produced was remarkable. No doubt the shortness of the crop\r\nin the portion allotted to this machine may have had something to do\r\nwith this, as a longer straw is more likely than a shorter one to\r\nconnect two sheaves and produce that hanging together which in other\r\nmachines is so often observed to precede a miss in the binding. Mr.\r\nWood's machine had a stronger crop and longer straw to deal with, and\r\nthe hanging together of the sheaves occurred far too frequently, and was\r\nalmost always followed by a loose sheaf. The Johnston harvester went\r\nthrough a very fair performance; there was no hanging except at turning\r\nthe corners, and the piece of work was finished in a shorter time than\r\nwith the other machines. Notwithstanding the automatic character of the\r\ngear for binding, we believe it will be found that the sheaves produced\r\nin these machines vary very much in weight.\r\n\r\nAt about 10:20 the next lot of machines started. They were those of\r\nthe McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Messrs. Howard, and Messrs.\r\nAultman & Co. Of these, the first-named only has the automatic trip. We\r\nbelieve it made no miss in binding during this trial, and the sheaves\r\nwere neat, though, perhaps, rather too tightly bound. There was no\r\nhanging together or check in this run. The machine of Messrs. Aultman &\r\nCo. was not so successful in separating the sheaves, though this was\r\nnot so often followed by an unbound sheaf as in some other machines.\r\nSometimes as many as three sheaves, clinging closely together, were\r\nejected at one time. To avoid this a man walked by the machine, and\r\nassisted the delivery of the sheaf. The tension of the string which\r\nbinds the sheaves varies a good deal in this machine, some of the\r\nsheaves being rather too loosely held together, while at other times the\r\nfault is in the other direction. In Messrs. Howard's machine there is a\r\ntendency in the sheaves to cling together, but this is not accompanied\r\nto any extent with missing the binding. Mr. King attempted a run after\r\nthe three last had finished their plots; but his machinery had not been\r\nfully adjusted, and after one course the trial stopped. As far as one\r\ncould judge from this short performance, the chief fault in the sheaf\r\nproduced was the uncertain position of the string upon it. Sometimes\r\nthis was near the bottom of the straw, and sometimes among the corn.\r\nUnfortunately at 11:25 the rain began, and experiments were stopped till\r\nthe afternoon. It was no light shower which could give a check to the\r\nardor of the judges and other officers of the society, but a heavy\r\ndownpour of some hours' duration, which soaked the crop through and\r\nthrough. Indeed, we think it a pity that the experiments should have\r\nbeen continued at all under circumstances in which practical harvesting\r\nwould have been out of the question. However, after a short lull in the\r\nrain, the machines of Mr. Wood, Messrs. Samuelson, and the McCormick\r\nHarvesting Company went into the wet barley. The machine of Mr. Wood\r\nworked most rapidly, but the clinging of the sheaves and the failure to\r\nbind were again very apparent. The stubble left by this machine was the\r\nshortest and most even of the three. The machines of Messrs. Samuelson\r\nand the McCormick Company left a very ragged, long, and uneven stubble\r\nin this trial, though the delivery and binding of the sheaves seemed to\r\nbe as good as in the oats trial. The binding in the former was rather\r\ntoo tight.\r\n\r\nThe remaining machines, with the exception of that of Mr. King, then\r\nattempted a trial; but Messrs. Howard's machine having too smooth a\r\nface to the driving wheel, was unable to drive all the gear in the wet\r\ncondition of the ground. The damp weather had no doubt tightened up the\r\ncanvas carriers, and thereby added to the work to be done; but this was\r\nthe only machine that was found incapacitated through the action of\r\nthe rain. Unfortunately the plots assigned to this machine and to the\r\nJohnston harvester were in juxtaposition, so that the latter machine\r\nwas blocked by the former, and could not proceed, and that of Messrs.\r\nAultman alone went through with its work. There was no improvement in\r\nthe separation of the sheaves, and the misses were rather more frequent\r\nthan in the trials among the oats. The sheaves, too, that issued singly\r\nwere somewhat wanting in neatness. The whole of these barley trials must\r\nbe looked upon as unsatisfactory, on account of the condition of the\r\ncrop, and it is to be hoped that before the investigations are brought\r\nto a conclusion all these machines may have a more favorable opportunity\r\nof demonstrating the advantages which are claimed for them. It may be\r\nhere said that throughout these trials there has been as yet no wind\r\nat all, which, as the investigations are in other respects to be so\r\nthoroughly carried out, is a matter of regret. Probably Messrs. Howard's\r\nmachine was as well protected from the wind as any other of the seven\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nThe following are the awards of the judges, which were made known\r\non Wednesday evening: Gold medal--Messrs. McCormick & Co. Silver\r\nmedals--Messrs. Samuelson, Messrs. Johnston & Co. Highly commended--Mr.\r\nH. J. King, for principle of tying and separating sheaves. The only\r\ngleaning binding machine which entered the field was that of Mr. J. G.\r\nWalker, made by the Notts Fork Company, but no official trials of this\r\nwere made.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULTURE OF STRAWBERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ellwanger & Barry, of the Mount Hope Nurseries, at Rochester,\r\ngive the following directions for setting out and cultivating\r\nstrawberries, the result of long and successful experience, in their\r\nrecently issued Strawberry Catalogue:\r\n\r\n_The Soil and Its Preparation_.--The strawberry may be successfully\r\ngrown in any soil adapted to the growth of ordinary field or garden\r\ncrops. The ground should be _well_ prepared, by trenching or plowing at\r\nleast eighteen to twenty inches deep, and be _properly enriched_ as for\r\nany garden crop. It is unnecessary to say that if the land is wet, it\r\nmust be thoroughly drained.\r\n\r\n_Season for Transplanting_.--In the Northern States, the season for\r\nplanting in the spring is during the months of April and May. It may\r\nthen be done with safety from the time the plants begin to grow until\r\nthey are in blossom. This is the time we prefer for setting out _large\r\nplantations_.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of August and September, when the weather is usually\r\nhot and dry, _pot-grown_ plants may be planted to the best advantage.\r\nWith the ball of earth attached to the roots, they can be transplanted\r\nwithout any failures, and the trouble and annoyance of watering,\r\nshading, etc., which are indispensable to the success of layer plants,\r\nare thus in a great measure avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN CULTURE.\r\n\r\n_To Cultivate the Strawberry_.--For family use, we recommend planting\r\nin beds four feet wide, with an alley two feet wide between. These beds\r\nwill accommodate three rows of plants, which may stand fifteen inches\r\napart each way, and the outside row nine inches from the alley. These\r\nbeds can be kept clean, and the fruit can be gathered from them without\r\nsetting the feet upon them.\r\n\r\n_Culture in Hills_.--This is the best mode that can be adopted for the\r\ngarden. If you desire fine, large, high-flavored fruit, pinch off the\r\nrunners as fast as they appear, repeating the operation as often as may\r\nbe necessary during the summer. Every runner thus removed produces a new\r\ncrown at the center of the plant, and in the fall the plants will have\r\nformed large bushes or stools, on which the finest strawberries may be\r\nexpected the following season. In the meantime, the ground among the\r\nplants should be kept clear of weeds, and frequently stirred with a hoe\r\nor fork.\r\n\r\n_Covering in Winter_.--Where the winters are severe, with little snow\r\nfor protection, a slight covering of leaves or litter, or the branches\r\nof evergreens, will be of great service. This covering should not be\r\nplaced over the plants till after the ground is frozen, usually from the\r\nmiddle of November till the first of December in this locality. Fatal\r\nerrors are often made by putting on _too much_ and _too early_. Care\r\nmust also be taken to remove the covering in spring just as soon as the\r\nplants begin to grow.\r\n\r\n_Mulching to Keep the Fruit Clean_.--Before the fruit begins to ripen,\r\nmulch the ground among the plants with short hay or straw, or grass\r\nmowings from the lawn, or anything of that sort. This will not only keep\r\nthe fruit clean, but will prevent the ground from drying and baking, and\r\nthus lengthen the fruiting season. Tan-bark can also be used as a mulch.\r\n\r\nA bed managed in this way will give two full crops, and should then be\r\nspaded or plowed down, a new one having been in the meantime prepared to\r\ntake its place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD CULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe same directions with regard to soil, time of planting, protection,\r\nand mulching, as given above, are applicable when planting on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n_The Matted Row System_.--The mode of growing usually pursued has its\r\nadvantages for field culture, but cannot be recommended for the garden.\r\nIn the field we usually plant in rows three to four feet apart, and the\r\nplants a foot to a foot and a half apart in the row. In this case much\r\nof the labor is performed with the horse and cultivator.\r\n\r\n_How to Ascertain the Number of Plants Required for an Acre_.--The\r\nnumber of plants required for an acre, at any given distance apart, may\r\nbe ascertained by dividing the number of square feet in an acre (43,560)\r\nby the number of square feet given to each plant, which is obtained\r\nby multiplying the distance between rows by the distance between the\r\nplants. Thus strawberries planted three feet by one foot give each plant\r\nthree square feet, or 14,520 plants to the acre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME HARDY FLOWERS FOR MIDSUMMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPretentious gardens are now gayly decorated with glowing masses\r\nof pelargoniums and vincas, belts of rich coleuses and fiery\r\nalternantheras, patchwork of feverfew and mesembryanthemum, and\r\nscroll-work of house leeks, but amid this gay checkering it is wonderful\r\nhow few flowers there are for cutting for bouquets. As tender plants,\r\nexcept the few that may have been wintered in windows and cellars, are\r\nbeyond the reach of most of our country folks, I will consider those\r\nonly that are perfectly hardy and in full blossom now, July 21.\r\n\r\nKoempfer's irises, blue, white, purple, streaked, marbled, and otherwise\r\nvariegated, are in bloom; they are the grandest of their race, and as\r\ndifferent varieties succeed one another, they may be had in bloom\r\nfrom June till August. They are easily raised from seed or by\r\ndivision--prefer rich, moist land, and if in a partly shaded place,\r\ntheir blossoms last longer than in full sunshine.\r\n\r\nTrumpet lilies are bursting into bloom; the scarlet martagon is at its\r\nbest; _speciosum_, tiger, and American Turk's cap lilies are yet to\r\nfollow. I find the trumpet lilies have done better this year than any of\r\nthe other sorts in open places. Most of the yellow day lilies are past,\r\nbut the tawny one is at its best; they are all hardy, and seem to thrive\r\nalike in wild or cultivated land. Seibold's funkia (called also day\r\nlily) has pale bluish flowers, and large, handsome glaucous leaves: the\r\nundulated-leaved funkia has beautifully variegated leaves, and pale\r\nbluish blossoms; these, together with several others of their race,\r\nare in bloom. They like to grow in undisturbed clumps in rich and\r\nfaintly-shaded nooks; if grown in full sunshine they bloom well enough,\r\nbut their leaves get \"scorched.\"\r\n\r\nThe European meadow sweet (_Spiraea ulmaria_), two feet high, and the\r\nKamtchatka one, four feet high, are in bloom; the double varieties are\r\nfar finer, whiter, and more lasting than the single ones. They will grow\r\nanywhere. There are many fine kinds of sedum or liveforever in season;\r\nsome of them like _album_ (white), _pulchellum_ (pink), _spurium\r\nsplendens_ (pink), _hispanicum_ (white), may more properly be called\r\nstonecups, but the stronger-growing sorts, as _S. warscewiczii_\r\n(yellow), should be regarded as liveforevers. They like open, sunny\r\nplaces, and dislike artificial waterings.\r\n\r\n_Dicentra eximia_ (pink-purple) is free, neat, copious, and a perpetual\r\nbloomer, as is also _Corydalis lutea_ (yellow). The climbing fumitory\r\ncomes up of itself from seed every year, and is now running over bushes,\r\nstakes, and strings, and is full of fern-like leaves and flesh-colored\r\nflowers. The long, scarlet wands of _Pentstemon barbatus_ are\r\nconspicuous in the borders; this should be in every garden, it is so\r\nprofuse and hardy. Many speedwells still remain in fine condition,\r\nnotably _Veronica longifolia;_ they are a hardy and a showy race of\r\nplants, and will grow anywhere. The main lot of perennial larkspurs are\r\npast, but by cutting them over now many flower spikes will be produced\r\nduring the fall months. The yucca or bear-grass is in perfection; its\r\nmassive flower scapes are very telling. It will grow anywhere, and once\r\nestablished it is hard to get rid of.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of perennial bell-flowers are in fine condition, as the\r\ncarpathian, peach-leaved (second crop), nettle-leaved, common harebell,\r\nand vase harebell. In the case of many of the tall-growing kinds, better\r\nresults are obtained by treating them as biennials than perennials. No\r\ngarden should be without the double white feverfew; the more you cut it\r\nthe more it blooms. _Anthemis tinctoria_, yellow or white, the yellow is\r\nby far the best, and the lance-leaved, large-flowered, larkspur-leaved\r\nand eared coreopsises are fine, seasonable perennials, as are likewise\r\nthe yellow, white, and pink yarrows, double sneezewort, the cone\r\nflowers, and large-flowered fleabanes, and all grow readily in\r\nany ordinary garden soil, and with little care. Hollyhocks are in\r\nperfection; feed them well and prevent many sprouts to each stool. Many\r\nkinds of meadow rue, as garden plants, have a bold, graceful appearance;\r\nthey love moist soil.\r\n\r\nIn good soil and a partly shaded spot we have no handsomer plant in\r\nbloom than the tall bugbane (_Cimicifuga racemosa_); from a bunch of\r\nthrifty leaves arise a dozen scapes of racemes, creamy white, and six\r\nfeet high. The scarlet lychnis and its many varieties are nearly past,\r\nbut the large-flowered, Haag's, and others of that section, are in their\r\nprime, and showy plants they are. They are true and lasting perennials,\r\nbloom well the first season from seed, quite hardy, copious, and\r\neffective; any ordinary garden soil. The pyrenean prunella has large\r\npurple heads; the false dragonhead (_Physostegia_), pale rose-purple\r\nspikes; centranthuses, cymes of red and white; centaureas, heads of\r\nyellow, blue, and purple; pinks, divers shades of red and white; and\r\nmonkshoods, hoods of blue or white; and all are very hardy, ready\r\ngrowers, and copious bloomers. The bee balm, one of our handsomest\r\nperennials, has bright red whorls; it spreads upon the surface of the\r\nground like mint, and thus may be divided and increased to any extent.\r\nIt loves rich, moist land, but is not fastidious. Among the evening\r\nprimroses the Missouri one is the brightest and biggest; _speciosa_,\r\nwhite, from Texas, of blossoms the most prolific; _glauca, riparia,\r\nfruticera_, and _linearis_, all yellow; many others, though perennial,\r\nare best treated as annual or biennial. The spiked loosestrife planted\r\nby the water's edge of a pond is far finer than in the garden border. It\r\nhas hundreds of red spikes.\r\n\r\nAdd to these, everlasting peas, musk mallows, spiderwort, globe\r\nthistles, bold senecios, the finer milkweeds, _Scabiosa, Gallium_,\r\nChinese _Astilbe_, various kinds of loosestrife (_Lysimachia_), and many\r\nothers as perennials, and _Coreopsis_, balsams, zinnias, marigolds,\r\nstocks, Swan river daisy, mignonnette, sweet peas, sweet alyssum,\r\nmorning glories, larkspurs, canary flowers, cucumber-leaved sunflowers,\r\nverbenas, petunias, corn flower, Drummond phlox, double and single\r\npoppies, snapdragons, _Phacelia, Gilia, Clarkia_, candytuft, red flax,\r\ntassel flowers, blue _Anchusa, Gaillardia_, and a multitude besides of\r\nseasonable annuals, which can all be raised quite easily without a frame\r\nor green-house, and what excuse has any farmer for having a flowerless\r\ngarden in midsummer?--_William Falconer, in Country Gentleman_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIME-CONSUMING MATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Prince, splint manufacturer, of Horseshoe Bay, Buckingham\r\ntownship, is authority for the statement that there are about twenty-two\r\nmatch factories in the United States and Canada, and that the daily\r\nproduction--and consequent daily consumption--is about twenty-five\r\nthousand gross per day. It may seem a queer statement to make that one\r\nhundred thousand hours of each successive day are spent by the people of\r\nthe two countries in striking a light, but such is undoubtedly the case.\r\nIn each gross of matches manufactured there are 144 boxes, so that the\r\n25,000 gross produces 3,600,000 boxes. Each box, at least those made\r\nin the States, where a duty of one cent upon every box of matches is\r\nlevied--contains 100 matches, so that the number of matches produced and\r\nused daily amounts to 360,000,000. Counting that it takes a second to\r\nlight each match--and it is questionable whether it can be done in less\r\ntime than that, while some men occupy several minutes sometimes in\r\ntrying to strike a light, particularly when boozy--to light the\r\n360,000,000 would take just that number of seconds. This gives 6,000,000\r\nminutes, or 100,000 hours. In days of twenty-four hours each it figures\r\nup to 4,166 2-3, and gives eleven years and five months with a couple of\r\ndays extra, as the time occupied during every twenty-four hours, by\r\nthe people of North America--not figuring on the Mexicans--in striking\r\nmatches. Figuring a little further it gives 4,159 years time in\r\neach year. The fact may seem amazing, but it is undoubtedly quite\r\ncorrect.--_Ottawa Free Press_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
