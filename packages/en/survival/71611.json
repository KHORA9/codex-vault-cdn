But the two Jacksons were a law unto\r\nthemselves. They were comets among fixed stars, meteors in a still\r\nheaven. After the frightful holocausts of the Civil War, everything\r\nbefore it looks small.\r\n\r\nBut there are tragedies, even in an ant hill, and the life of the\r\nRepublic came nearer going out in the wilderness of 1815 than at Bull\r\nRun, Shiloh or Gettysburg, fifty years later.\r\n\r\nAs the fighting savior of his country, posterity is ultimately bound\r\nto rank Jackson ahead of Washington; for Jackson finished the War of\r\nIndependence, begun in 1776, on the eighth day of January, 1815.\r\n\r\nAnd he finished it forever.\r\n\r\nEngland never considered the matter closed at Yorktown, and when she\r\nmarched through the North, burning Washington in wantonness and derision,\r\nknocking her generals about as so many dummies and their soldiers as so\r\nmany tenpins, she was thinking of King’s Mountain and Yorktown.\r\n\r\nBefore Jackson’s day nothing was possible for the young Republic. She was\r\ngagged and bound, lying between England’s devil, on the north and west,\r\nand Spain’s deep, blue sea, on the south.\r\n\r\nSince Jackson’s day everything has been possible for her; a century of\r\nprogress and peace; the great Republic; the Monroe doctrine; the fighting\r\nprestige that could originate the cheek of a Venezuela bluff, and the\r\nremark the British admiral made to the German admiral at Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was a Johnstown flood, that made everything before it\r\nlook like the breaking of a mill dam on Coon Creek; but the Civil War\r\nestablished nothing—literally nothing. Two peoples of the same blood and\r\nideals had merely theorized themselves apart and into a war brought on by\r\nshadows bent on holding office and hence incapable of telling the truth.\r\nThe two things they thought they were fighting to decide are just as\r\nstrongly fixed to-day as they then were, to wit: that the town clerk is\r\nstill the man to attend to the town pump, and that white is not black and\r\nnever will be.\r\n\r\nThe only thing settled was whether there should be one town pump or\r\nforty-five, and whether it were better for the white to work the black\r\nunder a life lease or a yearly one. The ideals, aims, purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Republic are the same to-day as they were before the\r\nbig fight, and that it was a family scrap in which both sides would\r\nquickly double on any meddling intruder was demonstrated to the undoing\r\nof the arrogant Spaniard, who first trampled on the Republic’s ideals\r\nuntil she got to the fighting point and then foolishly brought on the\r\nwar, believing, among other things, that the “Southern Confederacy would\r\nrise again” and help her in the fight.\r\n\r\nAnd the Confederacy arose—at Manila and Santiago.\r\n\r\nBut so much has happened since Jackson and New Orleans, and so few really\r\nknew on what a narrow thread the life of all American ideals hung in\r\nthose gloomy January days of 1815, and so long has it been crowded out\r\nfor meaner things that it needs telling again, that the children may know\r\nit. For the grown people of to-day, born under lucky stars, made possible\r\nby the genius of Jackson’s work and the glory of his sacrifices, have\r\nbeen so busy picking up dollars that they have neglected to look up,\r\neven at the stars. This story is to show them the star.\r\n\r\nThe gamest thing God ever gave to the human race was Andrew Jackson. I\r\nhesitate, in a brief story like this, to attempt to tell the hardships,\r\nsickness, sufferings, mutiny, bickerings, jealousies, insults, lies,\r\ntreacheries, butcheries called battles, and starvations that he overcame\r\nto save his people and his country from Indians, Spain and England,\r\nand the Republic from that spirit of disintegration beginning with the\r\nHartford Convention and ending with nullification. For be it known to all\r\nmen and remembered, not in malice, but in forgiveness, that the first\r\nsecession convention that ever assembled to dissolve this Union of States\r\ncame together at Hartford, Conn., the very day Jackson was fighting to\r\nthe death to save the Union at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The beautiful Horse Shoe Bend (Tohopcka), on the\r\nTallapoosa River, Alabama—the last stand of the Creek Nation, and where,\r\nin a bloody fight, it was destroyed by Jackson.\r\n\r\n(Taken April 9, 1906, for Trotwood’s Monthly by C. W. Thomas, Dadeville,\r\nAla.)]\r\n\r\nAnd I say, not in malice, for there was in this, as there was in the\r\nother attempts of it in 1861, no question either of right or of wrong.\r\nNation—Country—Republic—Empire—these are all merely abstract things bound\r\nup in the concrete idea of a home. As long as the home maximizes and the\r\nNation minimizes, the latter is safe. But when it is reversed, when\r\ndoubt and uncertainty and discontent come in, the abstract thing is lost\r\nin the struggle for the concrete. And every home idea has the right to\r\nfight for its existence.\r\n\r\nBut winning is another thing, and if they fail no man has any license to\r\nwhisper traitor.\r\n\r\nBut for Jackson and the peace brought at Ghent by his destruction of the\r\nmost formidable savage allies England ever had, and the menace of the\r\nstruggling Republic’s existence; by his prompt unmasking of treacherous\r\nSpain at Pensacola and startling the hitherto unbeaten Briton by knocking\r\nhis forts down about his ears at Mobile and sinking their ships in the\r\nbay, Gettysburg would doubtless have been fought a half century earlier,\r\nand in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nLet us see: The War of 1812 was forced on the States intentionally and\r\nwith all the emphasis of a bully who meets a timid enemy on the highway\r\nand kicks and cuffs him for pure cussedness. New England was for standing\r\nthe kicking so long as her ships and schooners might still traffic in\r\nnegro slaves, rum, codfish and castor oil. The war tied up her hulls to\r\nrotting at the wharves.\r\n\r\nThe war, until Jackson was discovered, had been a farce. From the Great\r\nLakes to the South the bull-dozing, beef-eating, bloody-shirted Briton\r\nsimply walked over the Yankee. “You’ll be setting the dogs on us next,”\r\nsaid a squad of Yankee soldiers, who staggered into a British camp to\r\nsurrender and got cursed for coming.\r\n\r\nNot one victory had they won. The British had burned the capital and run\r\nthe President out of the back door. They had murdered citizens in the\r\nstreets, and so empty was the treasury, and so degraded her credit that\r\nthe Secretary of War had to pledge his private credit to get money enough\r\nto send Jackson to New Orleans. There was not money or credit enough left\r\nto buy wood to keep the cadets warm at West Point, and the young soldiers\r\nof the Republic’s future wars had to go into the woods and cut it and\r\nbring it in.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time New England, the head and front of the Republic, sat\r\nsullen, secretly aiding the enemy and watching for a chance to secede.\r\n“Is there a Federalist, a patriot in America,” said the Boston Gazette,\r\n“who conceives it his duty to shed his blood for Bonaparte, for Madison\r\nand Jefferson, and that host of ruffians in Congress who have set their\r\nfaces against us for years and spirited up the brutal part of the\r\npopulace to destroy us? Not one. Shall we then be held in slavery and\r\ndriven to desperate poverty by such a graceless faction? No more taxes\r\nfor New England until the administration makes peace.” As if the cuffed\r\nand cudgeled administration was not doing its best, even to parting with\r\nthe last raiment on the back of its self-respect!\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of things there have been two kinds of great\r\nmen—talkers and doers. The former are called orators when they talk so\r\nmuch and so well that their talk becomes natural.\r\n\r\nClay was a talker—Jackson a doer. There was a time when these two men\r\nran side by side in the minds and memories of the living public. But\r\nthat public is dead now, and they are far apart. Only the doer lives,\r\nas only the doer should live. Talk, since the beginning of time, has\r\nbeen the cheapest commodity of the human race. “And Moses said unto the\r\nLord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent.... But I am slow of speech and of\r\na slow tongue.... And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses,\r\nand he said. Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can\r\nspeak well.... And he shall be to thee instead of a mouth.” That is the\r\nBiblical precedent for placing the orator over the doer.\r\n\r\nJackson was a Moses, Clay an Aaron. Clay, oily and brainy, and a man who\r\n“can speak well,” was sent over to make peace, with Bayard, and Gallatin,\r\nand Crawford and Adams—all Aarons and orators, and, praise God, all now\r\ndead and fast being forgotten. And they had been in Europe twelve long\r\nmonths, cooling their heels at the doors of diplomacy, or begging at the\r\nback door of its kitchen for such crumbs as the children might sweep off\r\nfor the dogs. And after a while they got a few crumbs—England might be\r\ninduced to quit her laying on of the lash if certain things were done to\r\nsalve her wounded honor, including the fact that she could still impress\r\nAmerican seaman wherever she could find them, and certain territory\r\ntransferred to England, including what is now Wisconsin and Michigan and\r\nparts of Illinois and Indiana. For England of that day was the England of\r\nthis day—a bully and a land-grabber.\r\n\r\nAnd then the climax came—Bonaparte went under. Bonaparte, who had kept\r\nEngland so busy she hadn’t had time to whip us before, now in his fall\r\nunfettered the one thousand warships of Britain that had kept him out of\r\nthe Channel and the Mediterranean and the army that later sent him to his\r\nWaterloo, and all these were free to fight the helpless under-dog across\r\nthe waters.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Aarons gave it up. One of them, Gallatin, wrote home from\r\nEngland: “The war is popular here, and that their national pride,\r\ninflated by their last unexpected success, cannot be satisfied without\r\nwhat they call the chastisement of America, cannot be doubted. They do\r\nnot even suspect that we have any just cause of complaint, and consider\r\nus altogether the aggressor and the allies of Bonaparte.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lake Tensaw, Ala. Known as the old Boatyard Lake. It was\r\nhere that Aaron Burr was landed as he was being conveyed from Washington\r\nto Fort Stoddard, and near where the horrible massacre of Fort Mims\r\noccurred.]\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of their contempt and billingsgate from the London Sun,\r\none of England’s great papers, of September 3, 1814: “The American army\r\nof copper captains and Falstaff recruits defy the pen of satire to paint\r\nthem worse than they are—worthless, lying, treacherous, slanderous,\r\ncowardly and vaporing heroes, with boastings in their loud tongues and\r\nterror in their quaking hearts. Were it not that the course of punishment\r\nthey are undergoing is necessary to the ends of moral and religious\r\njustice, we declare before our country that we should feel ashamed of\r\nvictory over such ignoble foes. The quarrel resembles one between a\r\ngentleman and a chimney sweeper—the former may beat the low scoundrel to\r\nhis heart’s contentment, but there is no honor in the exploit, and he is\r\nsure to be covered with the soil and dirt of his ignominious antagonist.\r\nBut necessity will sometimes compel us to descend from our station to\r\nchastise a vagabond, and endure the disgrace of a contest in order\r\nto repress, by wholesome correction, the presumptuous insolence and\r\nmischievous designs of the basest assailant.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Times—the so-called thunderer—speaking of President Madison:\r\n“This fellow, notorious for lying, for imposture of all kind, for his\r\nbarbarous warfare both in Canada and against the Creek Indians, for\r\neverything, in short, that can debase and degrade a government.”\r\n\r\nWhen word came to Lord Castlereagh of the capture of Washington and the\r\nKing of France said he doubted the truth of it, Castlereagh said: “It\r\nis true beyond all question, and I expect that by now most of the large\r\nseaport towns of America are laid in ashes, that we are in possession of\r\nNew Orleans and have command of all the waters of the Mississippi and\r\nlakes. So that the Americans are now but little better than prisoners at\r\nlarge in their own country.”\r\n\r\nAnd that is exactly what might have happened but for one backwoods Moses.\r\nAnd this Moses—it is ludicrous, even in its tragedy, to think what he was\r\ndoing when the event happened that first started him in his fame-crowned\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nA lank, fiery, swearing, drinking frontier lawyer, and general of\r\ncoon-skin militia, sharp and sallow of face, blue of eye, peaked of head,\r\nhis hair grizzled and tied with eel-skin, anointed with bear’s oil.\r\nFighting chickens or duels, running horse races or hounds, buying land\r\nand negroes, standing stallions and for every office worth while, from\r\nMajor General to Supreme Judge, and in all of it and every thing, getting\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“Getting there” more nearly fitted him in every thing he ever attempted\r\nthan any man of his day and generation. No American save Grant, Forrest,\r\nStonewall Jackson and Roosevelt has ever come anywhere near his record of\r\naccomplishing things, and the latter has never yet had half a chance for\r\nshowing what he might do in a pinch.\r\n\r\n“Jim,” said one of Old Hickory’s negroes to another, the day after the\r\nold warrior died, “does yo’ think ole Marster has gone to heab’n?”\r\n\r\n“Nigger,” said the other one, with becoming scorn, “does you think ole\r\nMarster has gone to de other place?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I don’t think dat—in course ole Marster couldn’t go to hell—he\r\nwus too good an’ kind a man fur dat, an’ too nice a gemman; but I jes’\r\ncan’t xackly see how he cu’d go to heab’n. De good Book say you mustn’t\r\nkill an’ you mustn’t cuss, an’ you know ole Marster wus right peart at\r\nboth.”\r\n\r\n“Nigger,” said the other, with emphasis, “if ole Marster tuk a noshun to\r\ngo into heab’n jes’ tell me who gwine ter keep him out—jes tell me!”\r\n\r\nGreat men are teeth in the cog-wheels of things, and sooner or later the\r\ngrooves they were made to fit will come to them.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity that knocked at Jackson’s door came from the arm of as\r\ngallant an Indian as ever made his word his bond—William Weatherford, the\r\nRed Eagle, war chief of the fighting Creeks.\r\n\r\nYears before, a Scotch boy, Lachlan McGillivray, sixteen years old, ran\r\naway from home in a ship bound for Charleston, S. C. He reached there\r\npenniless, joined some Indian traders, and drove their pack horses into\r\nthe Creek nation—for a jack knife! He traded this to the Indians for\r\nsome deerskins and laid the foundation of a fortune that made him the\r\ngreatest man in the Creek Nation and a power that three nations—Spain,\r\nEngland and America—courted till his death. He married Sehoy Marchand,\r\na half-breed, sixteen-year-old Indian girl, with the sprightliness of\r\nher French father and the black eyes of her princess mother, Sehoy,\r\na full-blooded Creek of the tribe of the Wind. Their son, Alexander\r\nMcGillivray, though three-quarters white, became the most powerful\r\nand influential Indian of his day. He held his own in diplomacy and\r\nstatesmanship with England, France and Spain. He was more than a match\r\nfor the feeble government at Washington. His sister, Sehoy McGillivray,\r\nmarried a Georgian, Charles Weatherford, who lived with the Indians,\r\nowned land by counties, upon it the first race track in Alabama, owned\r\nnegroes, thoroughbred horses, sheep and kine, ran the first cotton gin\r\nand held the first place of power among his people.\r\n\r\nWeatherford, the Red Eagle, seven-eighths white, was his son, and Sehoy\r\nMcGillivray was his mother. In his veins was Scotch, English, French and\r\nshe whose family was of the Wind. He was an extraordinary man.\r\n\r\n“His bearing,” said Pickett, who knew him well, “was gentlemanly and\r\ndignified. His eyes were large, dark, brilliant and flashing. He was one\r\nof nature’s noblemen—a man of strict honor and unsurpassed courage.”\r\n\r\nTecumseh, the greatest of all Indians, and a general in the English army,\r\nstirred up the Creeks as they were never aroused before. Acting for\r\nEngland with Spain, holding Florida as a secret and treacherous ally,\r\nhe induced Weatherford to lead his Indians against Ft. Mims, in South\r\nAlabama, filled with men, women and children who had fled there for\r\nsafety and were guarded by a lot of drunken, bragging American troops.\r\nThe tragedy was inevitable, for both Spain and England were behind\r\nthe Indians, England offering a reward for every American scalp—man’s\r\nor woman’s or child’s. And when the sun went down on the 30th day of\r\nAugust, 1813, unless she lied to the Indians, as is likely, she paid for\r\nfive hundred and thirty of them.\r\n\r\nMoney payment for the scalps of helpless women and children! Grand old\r\nEngland of Shakespeare, Drake and Wellington! Glorious vandals of Ft.\r\nMims and Washington and New Orleans! When I think of her in those days I\r\nremember only Davy Crockett’s famous toast to her: “The British,” said\r\nold Davy, holding up a horn full of whiskey, “an’ may their ribs make the\r\ngridirons of hell!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The road to old Fort Mims, as it is to-day.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not all a one-sided fight—they died game, even the little\r\nchildren—and the Indians buried six hundred of their warriors among the\r\npotato vines outside the stockade.\r\n\r\nWeatherford and Tecumseh sowed the wind. In vain the Red Eagle pleaded\r\nfor the lives of the women and children of the fort. For them he almost\r\nlost his own life and with clubs and guns drawn on him was forced to flee\r\nto save his life.\r\n\r\nNot knowing this, the Americans marked him for death first and branded\r\nhim “the butcher of Ft. Mims.”\r\n\r\nFive days after this massacre, which changed the boundaries of the\r\ncontinent and threw Jackson into an arena calling for every quality of\r\nhis grit and brain for years afterwards, Jackson, all unconscious of\r\nthis opportunity of his life—for the sweat-covered courier did not reach\r\nNashville with the news until September 19th—was engaged in a street\r\nfight to a finish with Thomas H. and Jesse Benton—two men who were\r\nafterwards his political champions.\r\n\r\nIt was a foolish, silly quarrel, more like that of boys than men. Jackson\r\nwas drawn into it through the eternal fiber in him that forced him to\r\nmake his friend’s quarrel his own. This friend was William Carroll,\r\nafterwards the gallant general who stood by him to a finish at New\r\nOrleans. Both Thomas H. and Jesse Benton were young lawyers living in\r\nNashville. They were friends of Jackson. Thomas H. at the time was\r\naway in Philadelphia on business of great importance to Jackson. Jesse\r\npossessed much of his brother’s fluency with none of his brains. He was\r\neccentric and excitable. In a dispute he challenged Captain Carroll. It\r\nwas all because some younger officers were jealous of Carroll and wanted\r\nto break his influence with Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn the duel with Carroll (which was harmless) he involved Jackson, and\r\nit ended in Jackson and the two Bentons fighting, in the streets of\r\nNashville, a bloody duel, in which Jackson was shot, his arm and shoulder\r\nshattered, and the two Bentons found themselves, one in the bottom of a\r\ncellar, and the other’s life saved by the luckiest chance. Jackson almost\r\nbled to death. It was three weeks before he could leave his bed.\r\n\r\nThat was September 4, 1813. Even then a horseman was riding day and night\r\nthrough the wilderness of Alabama with news of the Indian butchery. Even\r\nthen the Creeks, victorious and bloodthirsty, had collected an army\r\ngreater than any which confronted for years and baffled Miles, Crook,\r\nCuster and Canby, and were marching toward the Tennessee and Georgia\r\nfrontiers, with Weatherford, the Invincible, at their head. And Jackson,\r\nthe man who was to save them and fight the most brilliant Indian war ever\r\nfought on American soil, maimed, half-dead and soaking mattresses with\r\nhis blood.\r\n\r\nThe news made him forget his wounds and his feuds. Tennessee acted and\r\nplaced her treasury and her sons at the service of the man who would\r\nlead them against the Indians. Jackson was in command, but Jackson was\r\ndead—so they said. But when a member of the committee of the Legislature\r\ncame to his room and propped him up long enough to hear the committee’s\r\nreport, and regrets that he was not able to take the field—“The devil in\r\nhell I can’t!” he shouted, as he got out of bed and began then and there\r\nhis campaign against the Creeks. His proclamation followed. Propped up\r\nin bed, he wrote: “The horrid butcheries perpetrated on our defenseless\r\nfellow-citizens near Ft. Stoddard cannot fail to excite in every bosom\r\na spirit of revenge.... It surely never would be said that the brave\r\nTennesseeans wanted other inducements than patriotism and humanity to\r\nrush to the aid of our bleeding neighbors and friends and relatives.”\r\n\r\nOctober 4 was the day he designated for the troops to meet at\r\nFayetteville, Tenn., and on October 4 Jackson was there.\r\n\r\nA book might be written on Jackson’s Creek war. The Duke of Wellington\r\nsaid that if Jackson had done nothing else this war would have ranked him\r\namong the greatest generals.\r\n\r\nI cannot accept this as meant literally. But what a record of hardships,\r\ngrit, perseverance, gameness, generalship, resourcefulness, agony of\r\novercoming it is! Just one month from the day of his street duel in\r\nNashville he rendezvoused his troops at Fayetteville. He could not mount\r\nhis horse without help. He could not bear for a coat collar to touch his\r\nshattered shoulder. The least unguarded movement, and a thrill of agony\r\nwent through his bloodless frame.\r\n\r\nWe all remember the lives and years and treasure it took to subdue\r\neven the Sioux of the Northwest. Ask Crook and Miles and also poor\r\nCuster—soldiers all, equipped to a king’s taste and backed by the best\r\narmy of Indian fighters the world ever saw—except one, and that one the\r\nsmaller army that Jackson had to subdue in a twelve months the most\r\npowerful federation of the most intelligent Indians living.\r\n\r\nJackson marched into their territory October, 1813. By April, 1814, they\r\nwere killed or conquered, and those who remained, even their greatest\r\nchief, William Weatherford, were his friends and allies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old oak near Fort Mims.]\r\n\r\nThe infallible proof of a great general is his ability to turn his\r\nconquered foes into friends. This was Alexander’s, Caesar’s, Jackson’s,\r\nand Grant’s decoration. It was lacking in William the Conqueror, in\r\nWellington, Sherman and Sheridan. From Nashville to Fayetteville is\r\neighty miles along the old military road, now as prosperous a farming\r\ncountry as ever an army tramped across. At one o’clock, October 11, a\r\ncourier dashed into camp from John Coffee, guarding the frontier at the\r\nTennessee river, crying that the Creeks were coming. He started back\r\nin five minutes, saying that Jackson was coming instantly. Instantly\r\nwas always the better part of his religion. He acted instantly at New\r\nOrleans, and it was all that saved him. And no general, by the record,\r\nwho ever lived before or since, save perhaps Stonewall Jackson, would\r\nhave done it. Incredulous as it seems, by eight o’clock that same night\r\nthese 2,500 Tennesseeans, with their sick and wounded general, had\r\nmarched, footing it, thirty-two miles to Huntsville. Thirty-two miles in\r\nless than seven hours!\r\n\r\nThey crossed the river at Ditto’s Landing, and then began that remarkable\r\nwar of the civilized against the barbarian, equaled only when Caesar\r\nmarched into the woods of Germany and fought their great Teutonic hordes\r\nfrom daylight till death.\r\n\r\nAnd the Nervit were not braver than the Creeks under Weatherford, the\r\nRed Eagle. Canby was an Indian fighter, tried and resourceful. He fought\r\nthrough the Mexican War, on the plains with Albert Sidney Johnston,\r\nthrough the Civil War, capturing Mobile, and proved to be a hard-fighting\r\nand an iron soldier. But the Modocs butchered him.\r\n\r\nCuster—his fate is yet fresh in the minds of the living. In the war\r\nbetween whites he was the equal of Wheeler. With as many men and far\r\nbetter equipped than Jackson ever dreamed that men could be, he attacked\r\na mere handful of Indians compared to the great wilderness of them.\r\nJackson marched into and conquered, and yet they killed Custer, and every\r\nman of his brave but unthinking force. “Twenty-five hundred men and\r\nthirteen hundred horses on the bluffs of the Tennessee,” writes Parton,\r\n“on the borders of the civilization, about to plunge into pathless\r\nwoods and march, no one knew how far, into the fastnesses and secret\r\nretreats of a savage enemy! Such a body will consume ten wagon loads of\r\nprovisions every day. For a week’s subsistence they require a thousand\r\nbushels of grain, twenty tons of flesh, a thousand gallons of whisky,\r\nand many hundredweight of miscellaneous stores.” Yet Jackson fed them,\r\nwith little aid from any outside source, often eating nothing but parched\r\nacorns himself. His pathetic letters begging, commanding, beseeching\r\nthe governors of Tennessee and Georgia for food for his troops are\r\nwritten with an ink of fire. “There is an enemy I dread more than I do\r\nthe hostile Creeks,” he wrote, “and whose power, I am fearful I shall\r\nfirst be made to feel. I mean that meager monster, famine. I shall leave\r\nthis encampment in the morning direct for Ten Islands, and hence with as\r\nlittle delay as possible to the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa, and\r\nyet I have not on hand two days’ supply of breadstuffs.”\r\n\r\nHunger and mutiny—what would Custer and Crook and Canby and Miles have\r\ndone had these been added to the Indians? He ate acorns, and with a\r\nsingle rifle barring the path of his starved and mutining troops, he\r\nliterally bluffed and drove them on. Seeing it all clearly now, his\r\nvictory over the Indians was the lesser one.\r\n\r\nFighting Indians, fighting mutiny, fighting famine, fighting the terrible\r\nenervating, blood-sucking disease that preyed on his very vitals—this was\r\nthe Andrew Jackson in the pitiless forests of that pitiless age, with one\r\narm in a sling, sallow, bloodless and emaciated, resting his rifle across\r\nhis horse’s neck in front of the column of starved and mutinous troops\r\nhomeward bound and with eyes blazing, his grizzled hair bristling with\r\nfury, exclaiming: “By the Eternal, I will blow the first damned villain\r\ninto eternity that advances another step! I will hold this fort if only\r\ntwo men will stay with me!”\r\n\r\nHere are two pictures of him, then that go into you and stay—one of\r\nhis innate tenderness, the other his undying grit. At the battle of\r\nTallushatchee an Indian mother was found dead with a half-starved babe\r\nat her breast. “Let it die,” said the other squaws; “all its people are\r\ndead. It is the law of our race.” Jackson had it taken to his own tent\r\nand found a little brown sugar to make it a tea. He had it cared for,\r\ntook it home, adopted it, raised and educated it. It knew no father or\r\nmother save the conquering Jackson and the good Aunt Rachel.\r\n\r\nImagine Caesar coming out of Gaul with a fair-haired white child in his\r\ntent! This man was greater than Caesar, ay, than ten Caesars.\r\n\r\nThe other was his grit. Unable to eat what little he had, unable to\r\nsleep, there were times even when he could not sit his horse for the\r\ngriping pains of an outraged stomach. Only one thing gave him relief,\r\nand how he discovered it no one ever knew. Down from his horse he would\r\nslide, have a young sapling bent down, and hang over it, head down, till\r\nhe deadened the terrible pain. Imagine Alexander’s Greeks marching across\r\nAsia and beholding their god hanging over a young tree, head down, racked\r\nwith the pain of a woman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On Lake Tensaw, near Fort Mims. It was here Jackson camped\r\non his way to Fort Mims, after the massacre.]\r\n\r\nThe finish came at Tohopeka (the Horse Shoe) on the banks of the\r\nsweet-running Tallapoosa, as beautiful to-day as then. Never had Indians\r\nfortified before—breastworks invulnerable, with portholes. Behind that,\r\nlogs and brushwood, from behind which Indians love to fight, and all\r\nunseen. And the Creek Nation died there almost to a man and a woman.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the Red Eagle’s surrender is worthy a great artist. In the\r\nforests of Alabama. Sentinels—soldiers. The marquee of General Jackson.\r\nBig Warrior, a scalawag Creek, sunning himself by the door. Riding\r\nthrough the forest on the same gray, half-thoroughbred horse that leaped\r\nthe bluff with him at the Holy Ground the Red Eagle comes to give himself\r\nup, that his starving people might live. Tell me not this was martyrdom\r\nand patriotism of the highest, for well did he know what they thought of\r\nhim, “the butcher of Ft. Mims,” and easily could he have escaped and gone\r\nin to the British in Florida, as many of his comrades had done.\r\n\r\nBut if he had gone who would protect and plead for the starving women and\r\nchildren? Besides, he had found out the British and the Spaniards, and\r\nhe hated their ways. He knew that his life alone would atone for it all,\r\nand so he rode up to surrender and be shot for his people. A deer crosses\r\nhis path. He kills it with his rifle and flings it over the pommel of the\r\nsaddle. Some sentinels stop him. One points out the General’s tent, but\r\nnone suspects it is he, else he had not lived to reach the door.\r\n\r\nAstonished, dumbfounded, Big Warrior rubs his eyes and looks. Is he\r\nasleep? Can it be—can it be—\r\n\r\n“Ha, Bill Weatherford! Have we got you at last?”\r\n\r\nWeatherford looked at him. “You traitor, speak not to me, or I will put a\r\nball through your heart.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson heard, and, furious, stalked out with Hawkins at his\r\nheels. “How dare you, sir, ride up to my tent, having murdered the women\r\nand children of Ft. Mims?”\r\n\r\nSoldiers near by sprang up with bitter oaths. Not one but would have\r\ngiven an arm for the honor of killing him. A dozen guns leap up in\r\nthe wild shout and babble for precedence, but Weatherford sits and\r\ncalmly looks into their muzzles, while Jackson waves his hand and says:\r\n“Silence, and let him speak!”\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid of you, General Jackson—I fear no man, for I am a Creek\r\nwarrior. I have nothing to ask for myself. Kill me if you wish. I come\r\nto plead for the women and children starving in the woods. Their fields\r\nare destroyed, their homes gone, their cribs empty. They have nothing to\r\neat. Send out your men and bring them in. I did all I could to stop the\r\nmassacre at Ft. Mims. I am done fighting. My warriors all are killed.\r\nKill me now, if you wish, but save the remnant of our noble race.”\r\n\r\n“Kill him! Kill him!” shouted the soldiers, as their guns came up again.\r\nBut as he spoke Jackson had seen and understood. Over the head of the\r\nchief he saw, over the clamoring, cursing troops who begged for his\r\nblood, over the past, over Ft. Mims, over all—to Pensacola—to the British\r\nsheltered there, waiting to march into his land to plunder and burn; to\r\nthe Spanish, two-faced and deceitful, urging them on.\r\n\r\nInstantly he acted. Instantly his great heart, as true for the truth as\r\na hound for the trail, saw the nobility of the savage towering above the\r\nlittleness and ignominy of the greater race. And there flashed in his\r\nbroader vision Pensacola and New Orleans. He turned to his troops: “Who’d\r\nkill so brave a man as this would rob the dead.”\r\n\r\nWeatherford then threw his game at his feet. “Take it, my General, for\r\nWeatherford is starving.”\r\n\r\nJackson seized his hand: “No, by God, you come in and eat with me.”\r\n\r\n(The next paper will be “The Road to New Orleans.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Kelley\r\n\r\nBY BEN MCCULLOCH HORD\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE—If anything better than this has ever been written about\r\n    the war I have never seen it. It is worthy of the great\r\n    masters—of Sterne, of Thackery and Dickens. So pleased is\r\n    Trotwood’s with this sketch that we have secured the picture\r\n    of its author, Major Ben M. Hord, one of the best and truest\r\n    of men and beloved by all who know him. Major Hord has held\r\n    many positions of trust and confidence, was a gallant soldier\r\n    in the big unpleasantness and was for a term Commissioner of\r\n    Agriculture for Tennessee. He is still young, and this sketch\r\n    shows he is gifted as a writer. We will publish another story\r\n    from him soon.—Editor.\r\n\r\nHe was an Irishman by birth, and a blacksmith by trade, but gave up his\r\nbellows and tongs to “follow the feather” of his gallant countryman, Gen.\r\nPat Cleburne, in the Confederate Army, and became a gunner in a battery.\r\nIn many of his characteristics Mike was strikingly like his great\r\ncaptain. Though possessed of a rich vein of Irish wit and humor he did\r\nnot have that volatile, bubbling over-flow of spirits so natural to his\r\npeople; on the contrary, he was quiet and retiring in his disposition,\r\neven to apparent timidity. His only form of dissipation was tobacco. I\r\nwell remember his dirty little cob pipe, black with age and tobacco, with\r\na stem not three inches long, of the same color, and from the same causes.\r\n\r\nEvery old soldier who saw much active service in the field, in thinking\r\nof the close places he has passed through, will recall vividly the\r\nsunburnt face and form of some comrade, friend or acquaintance,\r\nconspicuous for his courage, brave where all were brave, but he the\r\nbravest of them all. In this light dear old lion-hearted Mike always\r\nappears to me, when memory harks back to the stirring scenes of forty odd\r\nyears ago. With the courage of a game-cock, the modesty of a woman, and\r\na sunny temperament, he was indeed a lovable companion, and when by your\r\nside in action, made you feel as if you had two right arms and a double\r\npair of eyes. It is not, however, to speak of his courage that I write,\r\nbut of some ludicrous incidents that happened to him after he “jined the\r\ncavalry.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEN M. HORD.]\r\n\r\nMike was torn nearly in two by a canister shot the second day at Shiloh,\r\nwhile his battery was engaged with one of the enemy’s, and as soon as\r\nhe was able to stand the journey, his surgeon sent him to his home in\r\nHelena, Ark., to die, as he thought, but which Mike, with an Irishman’s\r\nperversity, refused to do, and which he explained to me afterwards,\r\nin a half apologetic tone for not doing, that the shot really didn’t\r\ndamage his “in’ards.” It, however, incapacitated him for service in the\r\ninfantry, and as the Federal forces by that time had the river as far\r\ndown as Vicksburg, he could not well get back to his old battery, so he\r\nreluctantly joined the cavalry. I say reluctantly, because while he\r\nknew every bone and nerve in a horse’s foot, and was perfectly at home\r\nwhen he had that article between his knees tacking on a shoe, put him on\r\na horse’s back and he was as helpless as a new born babe. I doubt if he\r\nwas ever on a horse half a dozen times in his life, until he joined Capt.\r\nRufe Anderson’s company of scouts of Colonel Dobbins’ regiment, Walker’s\r\nBrigade of Arkansas Cavalry, of which I was also a member at that time.\r\nSeeing him one day, shortly after he had joined, hesitate on the bank\r\nof a little stream, as if debating with himself which would be wiser,\r\nto attempt to ride across or to get down and wade and lead his horse, I\r\ncalled out to him: “Grip him with your knees, Mike, and your back will\r\nkeep dry.”\r\n\r\n“Grip him with me knase, is it?” he replied. “Then, be jimminy, I’ll git\r\ndown and wade, for it’s myself that’s as bow-legged as a barrel hoop, and\r\nit’s me grub, not me back, I’m afther kaping thry.”\r\n\r\nSeveral months had passed since Mike had joined us and he had improved in\r\nhis horsemanship to such an extent that he would even venture sometimes,\r\nwhen very much aggravated, to punish the “brute of a baste” he was riding\r\nwith the spur, instead of dismounting and larruping the horse with a\r\nsprout, as he did at first. But notwithstanding his poor skill as a\r\nrider, Mike’s love of anything that might lead up to a brush with “our\r\nfriends, the enemy,” was so strong he was always ready and anxious to go\r\non our scouting expeditions.\r\n\r\nAnderson, the captain of our company, was a superb rider. Having spent\r\nmany years of his life on the Texas frontier, he could perform all the\r\ntricks in the saddle so common to the cowboys of the present day, but\r\nrarely ever seen then, such as scooping down and picking up his glove,\r\nhat, or pistol from the ground, with his horse at full speed. The\r\nfrequent encounters his company had with the cavalry of the enemy made\r\nhim pretty well known and much sought after by them, and through the\r\ncitizens they had obtained, not only a good description of him, but also\r\na thorough knowledge of his dexterity as a rider.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion our scouts reported a foraging train of the enemy coming\r\nout from Helena escorted by a squadron of cavalry. Weatherly, our first\r\nlieutenant, was in command of our troop that day, Anderson being absent,\r\nand as the old man was of a naturally quarrelsome disposition and never\r\nlost an opportunity to pick a fuss or make a fight, either in or out\r\nof the army, we were soon in the saddle and on our way to strike the\r\nescort of the foragers. We were considerably outnumbered, but Weatherly\r\nthought that if he would dismount part of his men, place them in ambush,\r\nand when they opened fire on the blue-coats, charge with his mounted\r\nmen on their rear, the advantage of the surprise would about even the\r\nthing up. So part of us were dismounted, Mike and I of the number, and\r\nplaced in a dense thicket not more than twenty paces from the road. The\r\nFederal column soon rode in, and at the word “Fire” the thicket blazed,\r\nand at the same time Weatherly charged, as he thought, on their rear\r\nwith his mounted men. A number of men and horses went down under our\r\nfire and the head of the Federal column was thrown into confusion, but\r\nonly for a moment, for we had struck the Fifth Kansas, commanded by Maj.\r\nSam Walker, as good a body of cavalry and as brave an officer as there\r\nwas in either army. At command they wheeled and formed, fronting the\r\nthicket, and charged in the face of our second volley. At the same time\r\na yell, distinctly “Yankee,” and a heavy discharge of carbines farther\r\ndown the road to our right, told us as plainly as if we had seen it, that\r\nWeatherly had wedged himself in between the advance guard and main column\r\nof the enemy. At this unexpected turn of affairs, with nothing but our\r\nsix-shooters to hold back such odds (we did not have time to reload our\r\nguns), it did not take long to determine what to do. “Fall back to your\r\nhorses,” was the order, and we fell.\r\n\r\nMike and I were together. Partly on account of his old wound, but\r\nmostly, I think, on account of his contentious disposition under such\r\ncircumstances, he was the poorest runner I ever saw—at least it impressed\r\nme so at the time—and when we reached our horse-holder he was mounted,\r\nthe others all gone, and throwing the reins to us he followed in hot\r\nhaste. I was in my saddle instantly; Mike was not so fortunate. His\r\nhorse, a long, lank old bay, as thin as a fence rail, excited by the\r\nshooting, shouting, and running, was plunging viciously around in the\r\nbrush dragging Mike, who was pawing the air with first one foot and then\r\nthe other in fruitless efforts to catch the stirrup, at the same time\r\nkeeping up a continuous string of comments upon the situation generally,\r\ninterspersed with bits of advice to me and curses at his horse, such\r\nas: “Give’m a taste of your shooting, boy,” “Whoa, you d—d old brute of\r\na baste,” “Look at the blue divils how they swarm,” “What a d—d fool\r\nold Weatherly was,” “Struck’m in the middle,” “Divil take the cavalry\r\nservice,” “Whoa, you—”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Federals, finding nothing in front of them, were\r\ncoming on as fast as the nature of the ground would admit, firing at\r\nrandom, for the bushes were so thick they could not see ten feet ahead of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlthough expecting to show a clean pair of heels to the enemy, I had\r\ninstinctively drawn a fresh pistol from my holster when I mounted, and\r\naccording to Mike’s advice was using it to the best advantage I could,\r\nat the same time anxiously watching his circus performance with the\r\nold bay, and inwardly praying that it would come to a speedy close, or\r\nboth of us would be either killed or captured, in a half minute more. I\r\ncouldn’t leave him under the circumstances, for he had more than once\r\nstood between me and “the other shore,” in places equally as close, and\r\nto desert him now, would look like rank ingratitude and cowardice.\r\n\r\n“Turn him loose, Mike, and jump up behind me, it’s our last chance,” I\r\nyelled, and at that instant the front line of the enemy burst through the\r\nthicket into the open woods within thirty steps of us. Bang! bang! bang!\r\nwent the carbines. “Halt! halt! surrender! surrender!” they called out. I\r\nwheeled, to pick up Mike, if possible, and take my chances running, just\r\nin time to see his horse lunge forward and he lying like a sack of meal\r\ncrosswise in the saddle, with one hand clutching the mane about midway\r\nhis horse’s neck. My first impression was that he had been shot, and I\r\nwas relieved to see him wiggle his leg over the blanket strapped behind\r\nhis saddle, and straighten up. Our horses were going at racing speed and\r\nMike was doing some wonderful riding. He was bouncing about like a ball,\r\nneither foot in a stirrup, and he showed no partiality for any particular\r\nplace to sit. Every time his old horse would make a jump, Mike would\r\ncome down on him in a different place—behind the cantle, in the saddle,\r\nover the pommel on his neck, then back again, up one side and down the\r\nother—he literally rode the old bay from his ears to his tail. A fallen\r\ntree was in front of us, both horses took the leap at the same time, and\r\nMike disappeared on the far side of his old “brute of a baste”—gone this\r\ntime, sure, I thought, but the next instant, bare-headed he bounced back\r\non top again. Our pursuers, not liking to follow us too far in the woods,\r\nfired a parting volley of lead and curses at us and pulled up. A few\r\nhundred yards farther on we run into our scattered squad, that had halted\r\nand reformed.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Weatherly having gotten the company together, we were\r\npegging away at the rear guard of the enemy as they leisurely fell back\r\ninto Helena, having sent their well-loaded wagons on in front. I stopped\r\na moment to get a drink of water at a farm house the enemy had just left.\r\nThe old man had a son in our company, and was anxious to hear from him,\r\nand learn something of the skirmish.\r\n\r\n“I tell you they came very near getting Captain Anderson,” he said, after\r\nlearning that his boy was all right.\r\n\r\n“How’s that?” I asked, “Captain Anderson wasn’t in the skirmish at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes he was,” he replied. “That Yankee captain that just left here\r\ntold me he rode right up on Anderson. Knew it was him from his riding;\r\nnever saw such devilish fine riding in all his life; said Anderson just\r\nplayed along in front of him, cutting up all kinds of antics on his\r\nhorse, and he could have caught him had he not been afraid Anderson was\r\njust trying to decoy him into another ambush.”\r\n\r\nI knew at once that Mike’s remarkable performance had been taken for\r\nAnderson’s skill. The story was too good to keep, and no one enjoyed it\r\nmore than Captain Anderson. When the boys run it on Mike, however, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, me lads, but there’s no danger of any of you blackguards\r\never being misthaken for your betthers.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the above episode before Mike had another\r\nopportunity, of which he took advantage, to masquerade as his captain\r\non horseback. One morning a scout came in and reported a strong body of\r\nFederal cavalry coming out from Helena, on what was known as the “middle\r\nroad” to Little Rock, on a scouting expedition; which for the benefit of\r\nthe younger generation I will say simply meant they were hunting for a\r\nfight. I remember very distinctly I thought those Western fellows were\r\nexceedingly quarrelsome, and as Mike said, “a meddlesome set of divils,”\r\nin those days, and uncommonly handy with a sabre or six-shooter; but I\r\nhave met many of them since then, and together we have imbibed the juices\r\nof the corn and rye, and even of the grape, while talking over old times,\r\nand I have found it simply astonishing how erroneous early impressions\r\nsometimes are.\r\n\r\nThere were two or three public roads that branched off from this “middle\r\nroad” at different points between our camp and where the Federal column\r\nwas last seen, and after sending couriers to draw in all of our pickets\r\nand assemble the regiment for action, the Colonel ordered me to take four\r\nor five men, go down and observe the enemy, get their strength, report\r\nfrom time to time which road they were advancing on, so that he could\r\nplace his command and strike them on ground of his own choosing. Mike\r\nwent with me; he always did when there were any prospects of fun or a\r\nfight, and while the probabilities were rather slim for either in this\r\ncase, for I was instructed to keep myself concealed and after getting the\r\ndesired information rejoin the regiment as quickly as possible, Mike took\r\nthe chances of something turning up that would give him an opportunity\r\nto “bust a cap at the meddlesome divils,” and asked to be one of the men\r\nto accompany me.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly familiar with the country, and taking the little squad\r\nstarted on an air line through the forest for the point where the first\r\nroad branched off, which I hoped to reach before the Federals came up, so\r\nthat I could take a position suitable for my purpose and send a man back\r\nwith the required information without being seen by them.\r\n\r\nA half-hour’s rapid riding through the timber brought us close to the\r\nplace where the roads forked and where I intended to take my first look\r\nat the blue-coats. The road here ran through thick woods. I knew I was\r\nclose to it, but the undergrowth, through which we were riding, was so\r\ndense I could not see it. I also knew that if the enemy had not already\r\npassed this point, allowing them ordinary marching time, they could not\r\nbe far off. Placing the men in line, some ten or fifteen steps apart,\r\nso they would be less likely to attract attention, we rode slowly and\r\ncautiously forward, feeling for the road. I took the place of lookout,\r\nand the men were to stop or move forward according to the motion of\r\nmy hand. Mike was next to me on my right, some ten or fifteen steps\r\naway, and while I watched for the enemy, he was to watch me, and when I\r\nsignaled him, he was to signal the next man, he the next, etc.\r\n\r\nWe had gone perhaps fifty or seventy-five yards in this way, when I heard\r\nthat dull, rumbling sound familiar to every old cavalryman, that told\r\nme we were in close vicinity of a large body of moving horses. Peering\r\nthrough the bushes in the direction of the sound, and without turning my\r\nhead towards my men, I motioned them to stop. The rumbling noise grew\r\nlouder and nearer. For a few seconds my little party were perfectly\r\nquiet, then Mike’s horse grew restless and began to move about. Watching\r\nintently in the direction of the approaching noise and without looking\r\naround, I again motioned Mike to keep quiet, but it did no good. I could\r\nhear him swearing vigorously in a low tone at the old “baste of a brute,”\r\nbut it only seemed to make the horse worse; he not only continued to\r\ntwist and turn about, but began to sneeze and stamp the ground. At that\r\ninstant I saw the advance guard of the Federal column file around a\r\nbend in the road not two hundred yards below us. I could tell from the\r\ndirection they were coming, that we were much nearer the road than I had\r\nsupposed, and that they would pass dangerously close to where we were\r\nstanding; at the same time Mike’s horse began to lunge around, snorting,\r\nsneezing, kicking and keeping up as much racket in the brush as a train\r\nof army wagons, while Mike himself was swearing by note and loud enough\r\nto be heard above it all.\r\n\r\n“Here they come, Mike! In the devil’s name keep quiet or they’ll bag\r\nevery mother’s son of us,” I said as I turned my face toward him to\r\nsee what was the matter. A glance explained it all. The old horse, in\r\ntwisting about, had knocked over a rotten stump and uncovered a yellow\r\njackets’ nest, that held a half bushel, it looked to me, of the maddest\r\njackets I had ever seen. They had sampled the legs of Mike’s horse\r\nseveral times, but when they began to swarm up and pop it to him on his\r\nthighs and sides, the old fellow could stand it no longer and bolted\r\nstraight forward through the brush, kicking, snorting, squealing like a\r\nmustang, and inside of fifty yards of where we were standing jumped into\r\nthe open road.\r\n\r\nMike and his steed were about the busiest pair just then I ever saw; the\r\nold horse was kicking, squealing, stamping, plunging and biting in his\r\nfrantic efforts to get rid of his tormentors, while Mike was giving his\r\nwhole time, and undivided attention, to swearing and sticking on. He made\r\nno effort to guide him, but by the luckiest chance on earth the horse\r\nturned up the road, instead of down towards the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently a startling apparition that thus suddenly appeared in\r\nthe road in front of the Federal cavalry, for they came abruptly to a\r\nhalt, and for a moment seemed undecided as to what it was, or what to\r\ndo, for the old horse had his busiest end towards them and they could\r\nsee, what must have appeared to them, a dozen or more horses’ tails\r\nflirting up and down, around and around in the air (for the old brute\r\nwas swinging it vigorously and with lightning rapidity), and a countless\r\nnumber of heels and legs flying out of this cloud of horse hair in all\r\ndirections. At the same time a shapeless bundle of something gray, was\r\nbouncing about on top, for Mike in his gymnastic exercise in holding on\r\nassumed many inconceivable attitudes, all of which were enveloped in a\r\nthin yellow cloud that certainly was not dust, and out of which came\r\ncurses, groans, squeals, and snorts. The old horse did everything but\r\nlie down to rid himself of the torture. Finally he made up his mind to\r\nrun, and such running—a streak of lightning would have been distanced\r\nat the rate he went. He looked as if he was literally flying and would\r\nonly touch the earth at intervals long enough to sling his heels out in\r\nvicious kicks, first on one side and then the other. At this part of the\r\nperformance Mike would bounce up a frightful distance, but always managed\r\nto come down on the neck, back, or side of his horse. I never in my life\r\nsaw such running, and can truthfully say no circus ever gave a greater\r\nvariety of styles in riding.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the horse stretched out into a run, and the enemy could see\r\nwhat it was in front of them, they unslung their carbines, fired a volley\r\nat Mike and a half dozen or them darted out at full speed after him. As\r\nthey passed I heard one fellow call out:\r\n\r\n“Look at the damned rebel how he rides, will you?” And a sergeant mounted\r\non a big gray horse shouted:\r\n\r\n“It’s Anderson himself, boys, come on!” and he drove the spurs in the\r\nsides of his horse.\r\n\r\nThey were too intent on catching, as they thought, the noted captain and\r\nexpert rider in front of them, to notice us in the brush, but being quite\r\nfamiliar with their methods, I was satisfied they would at once throw\r\nout flankers to prevent an ambush, so I moved back promptly to a safe\r\nposition, and after following and watching them for several miles, and\r\ngetting all the information desired, finally locating them on the proper\r\nroad, all of which I reported to the colonel from time to time by sending\r\na man back, I rejoined the command myself just in time to take a part\r\nin the wind-up of a sharp little fight that was claimed a draw by both\r\nsides. We held the ground, but the enemy was drawing off in good order\r\ndown the road they had advanced on. We lost some men and had killed and\r\ncaptured some of theirs. Amongst the latter I recognized the sergeant,\r\non the big gray horse, who had been so intent that morning on capturing\r\nMike, thinking it was Anderson. He was battered up a little, had caught a\r\npistol ball in his bridle-arm and evidently from the cut on his head had\r\nbeen knocked off of his big gray in the skirmish by some of our fellows.\r\n\r\nMike and I were standing by while his wounds were being dressed by our\r\nsurgeon. He happened to be a countryman of Mike’s, and with that never\r\nfailing, but indescribable bond of sympathy that the gallant sons of the\r\nEmerald Isle always have for each other, it matters not under what sky\r\nor flag they meet, they were soon engaged in an animated, but amicable\r\ndiscussion as to the merits of the two respective armies. With the\r\ntruthfulness of a saint depicted on his countenance, Mike made the most\r\nstartling and exaggerated statement concerning the strength and resources\r\nof our troops, and turning toward Captain Anderson, who had just walked\r\nup, he said: “I’ll l’ave it to Cap’n Anderson if I’m not right.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Anderson’s name and rank, the prisoner turned quickly\r\nand with much curiosity expressed in his face, critically eyed, over\r\nand over, the light but sinewy figure of the noted captain and skillful\r\nrider. Anderson noticed that he was being closely scrutinized, but\r\nwithout knowing any special cause therefor, he nodded pleasantly at the\r\ncaptive trooper and remarked: “That was a pretty sharp rap some of our\r\nfellows gave you over your head, sergeant.”\r\n\r\n“Right ye are, Cap’n,” he replied, “but it’s meself that would be afther\r\ntakin’ tin times as many, only to have caught ye this mornin’, whin we\r\nchased ye down the road.”\r\n\r\nI had not yet mentioned to the captain any of the minor details of my\r\nmorning’s work, so he knew nothing of Mike’s adventure with the hornets,\r\nfor that worthy gentleman, when he joined the command at the end of his\r\nwild ride, had simply reported that we had met the Yankees unexpectedly\r\nat a bend in the road and they had chased him some distance, but that\r\nI, with the rest of the men, was yet in the brush and would get all of\r\nthe information wanted. The other men that I sent in afterwards, had\r\nreported direct to the colonel and were at once sent off by him to hurry\r\nup different detachments consequently, Mike’s last feat in horsemanship\r\nhad not yet gained circulation.\r\n\r\nAnderson looked at the prisoner when he made the above statement, and\r\nshook his head doubtfully. Mike looked at me and shook his head slyly.\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, my man,” said Anderson. “I admit I have had to show\r\nyou my heels occasionally, but it was not on the cards to-day. That don’t\r\nlook like it, does it?” he added, as he pointed down the road to the\r\ncloud of dust that marked the retreat of our late adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant was not to be denied, however, for he had seen him, as he\r\nthought, with his own eyes and had shot at him; lowering his voice to a\r\nhalf whisper he said:\r\n\r\n“Faith, Cap’n, and it’s no shame to ye that ye run, for didn’t we have\r\nthe howl command at our back? But it’s a beautiful rider ye are to be\r\nsure; it’s yourself that can tache the best one that iver sthradled a\r\nhorse, and Jim Sullivan would give a month’s pay to see ye do it again\r\nand take a dozen more knocks like this on his head besides.”\r\n\r\nAnderson turned to me with a look of bewilderment on his face and asked:\r\n“What is the fellow talking about? What does he mean?”\r\n\r\n“Ask Mike,” was all I could say, for I was convulsed with suppressed\r\nlaughter. With a sly wink at Anderson and a droll look on his dusty,\r\nsmoke-begrimed face, Mike replied:\r\n\r\n“To be sure, Cap’n, it was meself that did the thrick on horseback this\r\nmornin’ the fellow is sp’aking of, jist for me own devarsion, and to show\r\nthe bloody divils how ye have taught your men to ride as well as fight.”\r\nAnd he gave another confidential and assuring wink at Anderson.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course—certainly, Mike—certainly,” said Anderson, anxious to\r\nconfirm any statement Mike would make, but not yet certain of his ground.\r\n\r\n“It’s the blissid truth I’m afther tilling ye, Jim Sullivan, if that’s\r\nyer name,” continued Mike, turning to the sergeant, with a face as\r\nserious as a Quaker’s prayer meeting, “whin I say I’m the poorest rider\r\nin the company, bad luck to the old horse for the same, but as ye had the\r\nleast bit of a taste this mornin’ of what I can do in the saddle, whin\r\nI’m a mind to, jist scratch yer head and think what the cap’n and the\r\nrest of the boys can do whin they thry.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked with open-eyed astonishment from Anderson to Mike,\r\nthen grasping the latter’s hand with a proud look on his face he said:\r\n\r\n“It’s ould Ireland, me lad, that can bate the world. Ye may be a poor\r\nrider in your company, but ye can make the best man in the ould Fifth\r\n(his regiment) ashamed of himself in the saddle, and by the same token\r\nsome of’m were rocked, whin babies, in horse troughs for cradles.”\r\n\r\nThe captain and myself left Mike and his countryman discussing horses and\r\nhow to ride them, but we were satisfied Mike would change the subject as\r\nsoon as possible, for he knew no more about either than a Digger Indian\r\ndoes of the Greek alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this before Mike had his “innings” on our friends\r\nin blue, although he did not come out as scathless as in the two scrapes\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nOur pickets reported a body of Federal cavalry advancing towards LaGrange\r\nfrom Helena, on the St. Francis road. Our regiment was badly scattered,\r\nhaving to picket some twelve or fifteen miles of country, but at the\r\nsounds of “boots and saddle” a hundred and forty or fifty men “fell in,”\r\nand with the colonel at our head we went trotting through LaGrange to\r\nmeet the enemy.\r\n\r\nSome two or three miles below the little village, the road ran through\r\none of those large cotton plantations common in that section, with a high\r\nrail fence on either side. In the woods just at the end of this lane\r\nthere was a thick, heavy growth of young paw-paws. Dismounting Weatherly,\r\nwho had in the meantime been promoted to a captaincy, and thirty-five or\r\nforty of his men, were placed in ambush along the road with instructions\r\nto open fire on the enemy as soon as they came up. The colonel took\r\nthe rest of the command, skirted the plantation and came to the lane a\r\nhalf mile further down and in their rear. We had scarcely reached this\r\nposition and formed in the timber before Weatherly’s guns opened. We\r\nswung by fours out into the lane and with a yell went at them under full\r\nspeed, Colonel Dobbins and Captain Anderson (the latter’s company being\r\nin front), leading the charge on the right and left of the column. The\r\nroad was as open and level as a billiard table, every man was driving the\r\nsteel in his horse, and we were going at racing speed. The rear companies\r\nof the Federal squadron promptly wheeled to meet us and poured a steady\r\nfire from their carbines on us as we came up. I happened to be one of\r\nthe first fours and was within a few feet of the colonel, when I saw him\r\nglance over his shoulder, slacken his speed somewhat, throw up his hand\r\nand call to Captain Anderson: “Let the men close up!” At the rate we had\r\nbeen coming, we were necessarily badly strung out, and the Federals were\r\nstanding solid across the entire road, not more than seventy-five yards\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nI pulled up my horse slightly and had half turned my head to look back,\r\nwhen, like a red streak, a trooper dashed by me. There was no mistaking\r\nthe rider. The reins were flying loose, the old horse’s blood was up, and\r\nso was Mike’s. He couldn’t have stopped him if he would and he wouldn’t\r\nif he could, for “Charge” to Mike meant “go in” whether there was one\r\nman or a thousand at his back. He was unslinging his gun for action as\r\nhe passed (a double-barrel shotgun loaded with buck and ball, and, by\r\nthe way, the best weapon cavalry could be armed with in those days for\r\nclose work). I had only time to notice this before our rear had closed\r\nup and the colonel again gave the order to charge. The delay was only\r\nthe fractional part of a second, but Mike was then flying fifty yards\r\nin front of us. I saw two puffs of smoke fly over his shoulder and he\r\ndisappeared in the cloud. The next instant we were “mixing with ’em.”\r\nThe action was short, sharp and fierce, the Federals using the sabre, we\r\nsix-shooters, and was too hot to last long. Their rear gave way, we went\r\nthrough, joined Weatherly, and never gave them time to reform until they\r\nwere driven inside of their lines.\r\n\r\nI was hurrying back to the place where I had last seen Mike, when I came\r\nup on our surgeon gouging into a poor fellow after a ball and inquired if\r\nhe had found Mike.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Dead?”\r\n\r\n“No, but wounded and on ahead in an ambulance.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t have an opportunity to see him until some time after midnight.\r\nI found him stretched out on some straw, with others, in a barn that had\r\nbeen converted into a hospital. His head was swathed in bandages and\r\nlooked as big as a half bushel. His face was so swollen he could not see,\r\nand the poor fellow was delirious.\r\n\r\nFrom the surgeon I learned that Mike had marched a couple of prisoners\r\nup to him, saying: “Take charge of ’em, Doc,” when he keeled over at his\r\nfeet with an empty six-shooter in his hand. An examination showed that\r\nhis head had been terribly beaten; the cuts were to the skull in five\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\nI afterwards learned from Mike, as soon as he was able to crawl out and\r\nsuck his cob pipe, that after emptying both barrels of his gun, he did\r\nnot have time to draw his pistol before he was wedged in the Federal\r\ncolumn, and clubbing his gun, he was “knocking the spalpeens” right and\r\nleft, when some “dirty blackguard” struck him over the head, knocking\r\nhim from his horse. In falling he was caught between the horses of a\r\ncouple of Federal troopers, his arms pinned to his sides as the horses\r\nwere crowded together in the lane, and the last thing he remembered they\r\nwere beating a tattoo on his head. When he recovered consciousness he\r\nwas lying in the timber and two Federal soldiers were standing close\r\nby, their command gone and they undecided whether to try and escape or\r\nsurrender. Mike decided the question for them. Struggling to his feet and\r\ntaking a pistol from the ground, having lost his own, doubtless in his\r\ntumble, he promptly ordered them to throw up their hands, which they did,\r\nand were marched back as above stated. Neither Mike nor his prisoners\r\nknew at the time that the pistol he pointed at them was empty.\r\n\r\nMike was a great favorite with the colonel, who, like the rest of us,\r\nwould occasionally joke him about his riding. Shortly after the incident\r\njust mentioned Mike was out sunning himself. The colonel passed by and\r\nbegan to rig him about letting his horse run away in the charge, and\r\ncarry him into the Yankee lines. “Run away, is it,” said Mike. “Och,\r\ncolonel, now it’s yerself that’s fond of a joke. Whin we swung out in the\r\nlane ’n ye told us to charge, if ye had jist tipped me a wink, and said,\r\n‘Mike, me lad, I don’t mane it, I’m only joking,’ me head would be as\r\nsound this minit as your own.”\r\n\r\nThe laugh was on the colonel, and he enjoyed it most heartily.\r\n\r\nDear old Mike! He answered the last “roll call” only a few years ago, and\r\n“passed over the river.”\r\n\r\nThe first time I met him after the war was at the general reunion of the\r\nU. C. V. Association in this city in 1897. I had gone to the headquarters\r\nof the Arkansas veterans looking for him, and learned he was out looking\r\nfor me. There were a number of the old company present, and as I stood\r\nchatting with them about the old days, some one remarked, “Yonder comes\r\nKelley now.” Looking up the street we saw him coming, with his hat off,\r\nmopping the perspiration from his face.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see if he will know him, boys,” said one, as they clustered around\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Find him, Mike?” one of them asked, as he came up.\r\n\r\n“No, bad luck to it; but I’ve been hot on his thrail these two hours\r\npast, ’n have nearly run the legs uv me off intirely. The little devil is\r\nas hard to catch now as he was thirty years ago, when he was riding that\r\nold gray horse,” he answered, as he threw himself down in the shade with\r\na grunt of disgust.\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh, but my heart was in my throat, and I did not\r\njoin in until the others had ceased. In an instant he was on his feet.\r\n“I would know that laugh in a thousand,” he exclaimed, looking eagerly\r\naround. I pushed my way through and stood before him.\r\n\r\nThe steel-gray eyes I had so often seen flash defiance in the face of\r\ndeath were dim with tears as his hand clasped mine, and when I felt his\r\narm around my shoulder, his bearded cheek against mine, there were drops\r\nthat were not perspiration falling from my own face.\r\n\r\nMaudlin sentiment of two old men, you say? Yes, if you choose to call it\r\nsuch; but a sentiment formed and welded together over and over and over\r\nagain in the fiery crucible of battle and one that death alone can break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrop Residue and Its Benefit to the Soil\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM DENNISON, FARGO, N. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow varied, great and wonderful are the blessings which a beneficent\r\nCreator showers universally upon this cosmos of ours for the benefit of\r\nmankind, and is it not strange that a majority of us fail to see these\r\nblessings, which are everywhere before our eyes? One of these blessings\r\nwhich the tillers of the soil are the recipients thereof, and which very\r\nfew of them recognize, is the beneficial results derived therefrom. That\r\nis the importance of crop residue as a help in maintaining the fertility\r\nof the soil. Nature is a great economist—she allows nothing to go to\r\nwaste. Everything is turned to some account in the grand, economic plan.\r\nEven the stubble which is left after the grain is harvested, there is a\r\nuse for it. Yet many of our farmers fail to see it. The farmers in the\r\ngreat wheat-raising states of the Northwest burn up their straw stacks\r\nwhen they want to plow the land for another wheat crop. This ought not\r\nto be. Nature has an important use for this crop residue. It ought to be\r\nreturned to the land as manure. It was prodigality on their part to have\r\nsold the fertility of their land in the wheat. But it was compounding the\r\noffense when they burned up their crop residue. Because the axiom is,\r\nthe more crop, the more crop residue, and the more crop residue the more\r\ndead vegetable matter to be oxidized. But for this wise provision made by\r\nan all-wise Creator, humanity would long since have perished with hunger\r\nfrom off the face of the earth. We do not wish to give out the impression\r\nthat crop residue alone will maintain the fertility of the land, but to\r\nconvey the idea of the importance of crop residue as a help in delaying\r\nthe period when land which has been under cultivation for years, without\r\nmanure (which is the rule in the United States) ceases to be profitable\r\nto cultivate.\r\n\r\n“It is a fact both of scientific interest and of great practical\r\nimportance, that the enrichment of a soil with nitrogen is confined to\r\ncertain limits, which can, with great difficulty, be exceeded. The\r\nlimit varies according to the conditions in which the soil is placed. A\r\nfamiliar instance of the limit is afforded by a pasture.\r\n\r\n“We have seen when the arable land is laid down in grass an accumulation\r\nof nitrogen takes place in the surface soil. This accumulation may be\r\nslow or rapid, according to the treatment of the field, but in the case\r\nof an ordinary meadow the accumulation does not pass a certain point.\r\nAfter a certain number of years no further rise in nitrogen appears in\r\nthe soil, although the external conditions of the meadow remain precisely\r\nthe same as they were when the former accumulation of nitrogen took\r\nplace. The influence of crop residue, Prof. Warington says, “where the\r\nammonium salts were applied without ash constituents the produce was the\r\nsmallest, and so was the nitrogen in the soil, and this nitrogen, like\r\nthe crops, was a diminishing quantity. Where superphosphate was supplied\r\nwith the ammonia the crop was considerably increased, and so was the\r\nnitrogen of the soil, which has shown little change in sixteen years.\r\nWhere the ammonia was used with a full supply of phosphate and potash the\r\nproduce was the largest; the nitrogen, too, of the soil was largest, and\r\nshows a tendency to rise.” “We see here at once a relation between the\r\namount of the crop and the rise or fall of the nitrogen in the soil. The\r\nquantity of nitrogenous matter in a surface soil can only be maintained\r\nwhen the crop grown on the soil reaches a certain annual amount. There\r\nis, in fact, an annual waste of the nitrogenous capital of the soil, and\r\nif the proportion of the nitrogen of the soil is to be maintained there\r\nmust be an equal annual addition of fresh nitrogenous organic matter.\r\nThis is furnished to the soil in the form of crop residue, consisting of\r\ndead roots, leaves and stubble of a former crop, and the dead matter of\r\nweeds. When this crop residue is of large amount, as in the cultivation\r\nof red clover or in any case of green manuring, or when smaller residues\r\nare left untouched by the plow and allowed to accumulate, as in the case\r\nof a pasture, the conditions for an increase in the nitrogen of the soil\r\nare present. When, on the other hand, the crop residue is nil, as in\r\nthe case of a bare fallow, or very small, as upon unmanured land, there\r\nis either none, or an insufficient replacement of the annual loss of\r\norganic matter in the soil, and the nitrogen of the soil consequently\r\nfalls.” “The proportion of nitrogen in a soil can only be maintained when\r\nthe supply of ash constituents (phosphates and potash) is sufficient to\r\nfurnish the necessary amount of crop and crop residue.”\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous organic matter contained in soils is for the most part\r\nan insoluble substance, a fact of the greatest importance for the\r\nmaintenance of the fertility of the soil. While in this condition it is\r\nof little use to the higher order of plants among which our ordinary\r\ncrops are included. To become available as plant food, it must be\r\noxidized and rendered soluble, but as soon as this step is effected it\r\nbecomes liable to be lost by drainage. Not many years ago we would have\r\nbeen satisfied in explaining the oxidation which occurs in soil as due\r\nto a simple contact with oxygen. We now take a different view of these\r\nchanges. We know that the organic matter of a soil is split up and\r\noxidized by means of living agents. A fertile soil is, in fact, teeming\r\nwith life of many kinds. Many of these living agents are quite invisible\r\nto our eyes, and yet are performing changes on a great scale, upon the\r\naccomplishment of which the growth of our food crops depends.\r\n\r\nThe living agents which attack the organic matter of soil may be classed\r\nas (1) animal life—worms and insects; (2) fungi; (3) bacteria. The\r\nworms, beetles, larvae, etc., in a surface soil feed on the recently\r\ndead vegetable matter left by the crop or weeds which previously had\r\npossession of the soil. The carbon of this vegetable food is oxidized in\r\ntheir bodies and exhaled as carbonic acid, while the nitrogen is excreted\r\nin simple forms of combination. The fungi also feed on the nitrogenous\r\norganic matter of soil; carbon is oxidized in their cells and exhaled as\r\ncarbonic acid, while their dead nitrogenous tissues restore to the soil a\r\ngreat part of the nitrogen which they had assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which favor the complete oxidation effected by bacteria\r\nare aeration of the soil by tillage, the presence of a suitable amount of\r\nwater and of calcium carbonate, and a high temperature.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned above of the natural limits to the accumulation of\r\nnitrogen in the soil. Prof. Warington thinks he can now perceive some of\r\nthe causes of such limits.\r\n\r\n“The addition of organic matter to a soil either as crop or weed residue,\r\nor as farmyard manure, at once makes that soil a suitable home for the\r\nanimal life—the fungi—and the bacteria, whose function it is to reduce\r\norganic matter to the condition of inorganic matter. An increase of\r\norganic plant residue or manure thus creates some of the conditions\r\nfavorable to its own destruction. The rate of oxidation in the soil is\r\nnow no longer what it was; the oxidizing agents have increased with the\r\nmaterial to be oxidized. If, therefore, a soil is laid down in pasture\r\nor receives an annual dressing of farmyard manure, the nitrogen in that\r\nsoil will only increase so long as the annual increment of organic matter\r\nexceeds the annual decrement by oxidation. If this increment is a limited\r\nquantity it will be met before long with an army of destroyers competent\r\nto effect its destruction. The richest soils are thus the most liable to\r\nwaste and demand the greatest exercise of the farmer’s skill to preserve\r\ntheir condition. When the conditions of the soil are changed, when the\r\npasture is plowed up or the arable land is left without manure, there is\r\nat first a rapid loss of nitrogen, but the rate of loss soon diminishes.\r\nThe organic matter most easily attacked has disappeared. The army of\r\noxidizing organisms has been reduced to starvation. A partial equilibrium\r\nis established when the annual destruction of organic matter amounts to\r\nlittle more than the annual residue of crop and weeds; but an absolute\r\nequilibrium is reached only when the annual loss by nitrogen is equaled\r\nby the atmospheric supply. In every case nature seeks to establish an\r\nequilibrium.”\r\n\r\nFor the American farmer to obtain good heavy crops, and consequently,\r\nlarge crop residues, there is only one way to do it. Invest some money in\r\nground phosphate rock, and after applying it, plant a legume—cow peas,\r\nred clover, etc., and the investment will pay you the biggest dividend\r\nyou ever received in your life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa-Growing in the South\r\n\r\nBY JOSEPH E. WING, MECHANICSBURG, OHIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH E. WING.]\r\n\r\n    (Ed. Note—Mr. Joseph E. Wing is regarded as the best authority\r\n    in the United States on Alfalfa. He was born in 1861, took a\r\n    common school education and worked with his father on a stock\r\n    farm. Went to the Rocky Mountains when twenty-five years old,\r\n    and became a cowboy, learning the business thoroughly and\r\n    becoming manager of a large ranch. While in the West he saw\r\n    the wonderful value of the alfalfa plant growing there, and\r\n    determining to grow it in Ohio he came back to that State,\r\n    bought the old home and went to work. He enriched and drained\r\n    the old farm, laying fourteen miles of tile underdrain in\r\n    a 320-acre farm. Last season he grew on that farm 400 tons\r\n    of alfalfa hay. His two brothers, Charles and Willis, are\r\n    partners with him on the farm, and they made last year, besides\r\n    the alfalfa and other products, 50,000 pounds of lamb wool.—Ed.\r\n    Trotwood’s.)\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will grow as well in the South, under right conditions, as it\r\nwill in any country in the world without irrigation. Alfalfa sown in\r\nthe South under wrong conditions will prove a discouraging failure.\r\nSo, therefore, it is far from any desire of mine to encourage unwise\r\nexperimentation or lead men to make unavailing efforts to grow alfalfa\r\nupon unfit soils or with wrong methods.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the few essential things that alfalfa demands. First, a\r\nsoil that is not sour.\r\n\r\nNext, a soil that is well enough drained so that water does not saturate\r\nit at any time of the year, unless for a day or two following very heavy\r\nrainfalls.\r\n\r\nThen a soil that is rich in the mineral elements that go to make plants\r\ngrow, phosphorus and potash, and well supplied, too, with nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAnd, to crown all, a soil supplied with abundant vegetable matter or\r\n“humus.”\r\n\r\nGiven these things, and the South’s sun and skies, alfalfa will grow in\r\nmost any part of the South and will yield annually four or five cuttings\r\na year of the richest forage either to feed green, or to cure into hay.\r\n\r\nAn acre of proper soil devoted to alfalfa will produce double the total\r\namount of available food for animals that an acre of corn will, and of\r\na higher class of nutrients. That is because the alfalfa is so rich in\r\nprotein, the muscle and blood-building elements that are so much needed\r\nin a ration for all young animals, for dairy cows or any animals giving\r\nmilk to their young.\r\n\r\nTo prepare an acre of land for alfalfa may in some instances involve\r\nconsiderable labor and expense. If the work is rightly done it will be\r\nlavishly repaid by the grateful alfalfa plants, and after they have grown\r\nupon the soil for a series of years they will leave it richer than they\r\nfound it.\r\n\r\nIf each farm in the South will grow alfalfa, even if no more than two\r\nor three acres, it will enormously increase its prosperity and wealth.\r\nThere are sections of the South where easily there may be developed large\r\nalfalfa fields. There are other sections where to grow alfalfa will\r\nrequire thought, effort, expense and care. Success when reached will\r\nrichly reward all this effort.\r\n\r\nIt is most unwise to sow alfalfa seed upon unfertile soils or without\r\nright preparation of the soil and attention to a few important details.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the few things needful, are of easy attainment, for there\r\nis no mystery about alfalfa growing.\r\n\r\nLet us take up the essentials of alfalfa growing: first, that the soil\r\nmust be sweet.\r\n\r\nIt is a new thought to Southern farmers, perhaps, that soils are some\r\ntimes sour. They may be sour upon limestone land, but are more apt to be\r\nsour away from the lime.\r\n\r\nIf they are water-logged during part of the year, they are most apt to\r\nbe sour. This acidity comes probably from the decay within the soil of\r\nvegetable matter, though some soils very deficient in humus are acid.\r\nAn evidence of acidity is seen when clovers fail to thrive, and certain\r\nweeds appear in the meadows.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of “sorrel,” the little red-topped weed that is seen in\r\nso many meadows of recent years, is an indication of acidity. A surer\r\nindication is the gradual disappearance of red clover and the difficulty\r\nexperienced in making it grow.\r\n\r\nLime is the cure of acid soils, though drainage is often needed along\r\nwith lime. It may be applied to a freshly-plowed surface at the rate of\r\nfrom one to two tons per acre of air slaked or ground lime, and in some\r\ncountries ground limestone is used with good results.\r\n\r\nLime is not itself a fertilizer, but it makes the land sweet so that\r\nclovers may grow and by their presence bring about enrichment of the soil.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is a clover, one of the best, since it is of very long life and\r\nsurprising vigor upon proper soil.\r\n\r\nThe South needs the use of thousands of tons of lime, in connection with\r\nmanures. Liming poor soils without manuring may not bring much benefit\r\nsince there may be too little plant food even when the soil is sweetened.\r\n\r\nThe older regions of the world, where advanced agriculture has been\r\npracticed for centuries, use great amounts of lime. The writer has seen\r\ngreat chalk pits in England whence had been taken thousands of tons of\r\nchalk (a soft limestone) to enrich the adjoining farms.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the South, however, where red clover thrives, the land\r\nhas in it enough lime, and is in no need of sweetening. We will then\r\nconsider the next requirement—drainage.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa grows through the aid of little bacteria that inhabit its\r\nrootlets. These bacteria must have air. Therefore the flooding of the\r\nearth by complete saturation of water destroys the life of the bacteria\r\nand of the alfalfa itself.\r\n\r\nIf a post-hole dug three feet deep in the field where it is desired to\r\nsow alfalfa shows water standing in it for more than a few days in the\r\nyear, that soil needs under-draining before being sown to alfalfa.\r\n\r\nIn general, the depth to the water level should be about forty feet. If\r\nthere is a greater depth it is generally better.\r\n\r\nNow, we will consider the matter of fertility. Alfalfa feeds deep in the\r\nsoil after it gets established and it secures a part of its nitrogen\r\nthrough the aid of the bacteria from the air.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is a gross feeder upon phosphorus and potash and cannot\r\nsecure these from the air. Nor will it at first secure all its needed\r\nnitrogen from the air.\r\n\r\nTherefore, land destined to be sown to alfalfa should be rich when sown.\r\nIf it is not rich it should be made rich before seed is consigned to it.\r\n\r\nNext, comes the need of humus in the soil. Now “humus” is simply decayed\r\nvegetable matter, and is best supplied through turning under vegetable\r\ngrowths such as cowpeas, or through the use of stable manures. Humus in\r\nthe soil does several very needed things.\r\n\r\nFirst, it supplies a direct plant food through the nitrogen, phosphorus\r\nand potash that it contains, being especially rich in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNext, in decaying it forms compounds that attack the locked-up mineral\r\nelements of the soil and sets them free to be absorbed by the plants.\r\nThen it absorbs moisture and makes the soil more slow in drying, besides\r\npreventing the close packing that comes with puddling in clay soils\r\ndeficient in humus.\r\n\r\nAnd as important as anything, perhaps most important of all, it puts\r\n“life” into the soil. Soils with humus in them are really alive, for the\r\ndecaying vegetable matter attracts bacteria of many sorts that in their\r\nlife and death and decay form many compounds that the plants can absorb\r\nand thus directly increase fertility and make plants grow.\r\n\r\nGood soils are truly “live” soils, filled with legions of microscopic\r\nforms of life, most of it beneficial to the higher orders of growing\r\nplants useful to men.\r\n\r\nPoor soils, deficient in humus, cold, puddled clays, are literally “dead”\r\nsoils and speak sadly of a dying civilization and decaying people.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa, then, revels in a deep, rich, sweet soil. How are we to provide\r\nit in the South?\r\n\r\nFirst, there are many river bottoms that are admirably adapted to\r\nalfalfa, being made up of rich alluvial loams, pervious to air and\r\nmoisture, and not holding a surplus of moisture. On these soils alfalfa\r\nusually thrives splendidly.\r\n\r\nNext, there are new lands freshly cleared where robber crops have not yet\r\nhad time to take out the fertility. Often these newer soils will respond\r\nwonderfully with alfalfa. Some very steep mountain sides are growing\r\nalfalfa finely when sown on freshly-cleared surfaces.\r\n\r\nSome lands are naturally fertile enough so that they will, with little\r\naid, grow alfalfa very well. Nevertheless, even the best of the old\r\ncleared parts need manure before being sown to alfalfa.\r\n\r\nWe had best admit at the outset that most of the old fields of the South\r\nneed enrichment to make them produce good alfalfa. And the best way to\r\nenrich them is with liberal coatings of stable manures.\r\n\r\nFew farmers are aware of the great value of manures. They enrich far in\r\nexcess of the actual potash phosphorus and nitrogen carried.\r\n\r\nLiberal dressings, then, of barnyard manure, applied before it has\r\nleached in rain, is the best preparation for alfalfa sowing.\r\n\r\nIf one has not enough manure to prepare the soil for ten acres let him\r\nattempt to sow but five. If he can’t manure five let him content himself\r\nwith two. Two acres of vigorous alfalfa will yield as much as ten acres\r\nof sickly, thin stuff on unprepared soil.\r\n\r\nAnd the two acres will make forage enough to make a further supply of\r\nmanure, so that he can next season enrich added acres and sow them to\r\nalfalfa. But while stable manure is the best thing and really almost\r\nindispensable to success in growing alfalfa upon old Southern fields, it\r\ncan be greatly helped by being re-enforced by mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\n“Floats,” or finely-ground phosphatic rock not treated with sulphuric\r\nacid, is a very cheap supply of phosphorus. This phosphorus is not\r\navailable when applied to some soils deficient in humus.\r\n\r\nBut when floats are mixed with stable manure in some way the phosphorus\r\nis made available and the plants can get it. Therefore, the wise farmer\r\nsprinkles his stables with floats which absorb the ammonia and makes the\r\nstable smell sweet, and when the manure is applied its value has been\r\nalmost doubled. Stable manure fortified with floats is the thing to apply\r\nto the soil to make alfalfa grow.\r\n\r\nThis manure may be applied to a preceding crop of corn or tobacco, if it\r\nis applied heavily enough so that there is a large residue left.\r\n\r\nOr it may be applied directly before the ground is plowed for alfalfa.\r\nThis is a safe way. It may be turned under or harrowed in or disked in or\r\nleft to lie on the surface through the winter and the land plowed in the\r\nearly spring.\r\n\r\nJust get it over the land in any way and as soon as convenient after it\r\nis made; it will do the work.\r\n\r\nApply as much as twenty-five tons to the acre and more if you have it.\r\nThis will be a help, but in strong Southern clays there is no need to\r\nfear putting on an abundance; it will not leach away, and the more\r\nhumus you get in that soil the better your alfalfa will be. Do not be\r\ndiscouraged by this information; you can afford to use the manure to\r\nstart a crop that maintains itself and makes such a large amount of\r\nforage that will, if fed and the manure saved, in turn enrich yet other\r\nfields for many years.\r\n\r\nLate in winter or early in spring the land may be plowed. It should\r\nbe broken deep and as soon as the land is ready to work, it should be\r\nharrowed to a good seed bed.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa wants a firm seed bed, so that the little rootlets find an\r\nunbroken way down into the moist earth beneath.\r\n\r\nAt a little later than time for sowing oats, say the last week in March,\r\nafter danger of hard freezing is over, sow the seed. A peck of alfalfa\r\nseed, fifteen pounds, is enough to the acre; more is waste. There are in\r\na bushel 14,448,000 individual alfalfa seeds. To sow fifteen pounds per\r\nacre would put on eighty-three seeds to the square foot. Twelve plants to\r\nthe square foot are all that will grow to maturity.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown broadcast and harrowed in. It may be sown broadcast\r\nand covered by drilling in after it a bushel to the acre of spring\r\nbarley, an excellent nurse crop. The beardless barley is the best. Or a\r\nhalf bushel of oats sown on an acre will serve as a nurse crop, only that\r\nin this case the oats must be cut for hay as soon as bloom appears and\r\nbefore they lodge.\r\n\r\nThe land after seeding must be left smooth so that the mower may be run\r\nover it close to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere may be sown fertilizer with the alfalfa to help the manure and it\r\nwill probably be well repaid.\r\n\r\nAfter the alfalfa is sown, if the land is very dry and cloddy it should\r\nbe rolled. If it is moist, a plank drag should make it smooth and level.\r\n\r\nAt the time of sowing, if some earth from an old alfalfa field can be\r\nhad, it is well to make it fine and sow it over the field at the rate of\r\nabout 100 pounds to the acre, or soil on which sweet clover (mellilotus)\r\nhas grown. The object of this is to transfer some of the bacteria that\r\nthrive on alfalfa roots to the new field. It is as the housewife puts\r\nyeast in her bread.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the manure has been put into the soil and it is not sour, the\r\nseed itself will carry enough bacteria to shortly innoculate the field.\r\nThese bacteria increase very rapidly in soils filled with humus.\r\n\r\nA good test of whether a field will grow alfalfa or not is to observe\r\nwhether it contains earthworms (fish worms). If it does not the condition\r\nis wrong for alfalfa culture.\r\n\r\nAfter this sowing nothing should be done to the field until the barley is\r\nripe or the oats in bloom. It may then be cut close to the ground. This\r\nclose cutting is good for the young alfalfa, which needs clipping at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSet the binder then to cut as close as possible, and if it must be cut\r\nhigh for any reason follow at once with the mower and clip the stubble\r\nclose. Then let the alfalfa alone to make a second growth. If there\r\nshould come rain it will grow rapidly for about forty-five days or a\r\nlittle longer. After that it may turn yellow and cease to grow.\r\n\r\nThat means that rust has struck it. Leaf rust is the pest of alfalfa in\r\nall Eastern States. The remedy for rust is mowing off the stems as close\r\nto the ground as practicable.\r\n\r\nIf there is enough hay to be worth saving rake it off and cure it.\r\nIf weeds are the main growth, allow them to lie and mulch the land,\r\nsupposing them not to be thick enough to smother it.\r\n\r\nWhen winter sets in have a growth a foot high standing to protect the\r\ncrowns and hold the snow. Do not ever pasture alfalfa the first season.\r\nDo not ever allow stock to tramp over it in cold weather, nor drive\r\nacross it with wagons.\r\n\r\nOftentimes the fall is a good time to sow alfalfa in the South. When\r\nthere is enough moisture in the land to start it well in August or\r\nSeptember it may succeed well, sown alone. The manner would be to plow a\r\nwheat stubble as soon as possible after harvest, applying a light coat of\r\nmanure, and immediately working it down to a good seed bed, using every\r\ncare to prevent its drying out.\r\n\r\nThe way to do this is to have a harrow and roller in the field when the\r\nbreaking is done. Let the plows run a quarter of a day and finish out\r\nthat half day by rolling and harrowing the ground to bring it to a degree\r\nof fineness that will enable it to hold moisture.\r\n\r\nNo nurse crop is needed when alfalfa is sown in the fall; it must be\r\nabout an inch deep and should not be sown when there is merely a little\r\nmoisture in the ground with dry soil beneath, lest it sprout and perish\r\nbefore rains come.\r\n\r\nWeeds will not trouble this fall-sown alfalfa much and it makes four\r\ncrops of hay the next year, though not quite so heavy crops as the\r\nspring-sown alfalfa should make.\r\n\r\nThe time to make alfalfa hay is when it is about half in bloom and before\r\nthe leaves have fallen from the stem. That will be about the tenth of\r\nMay. Take this first crop off promptly to secure the hay while it is in\r\nits prime and to allow the next crop to come on.\r\n\r\nCure the hay by raking into small windrows while it is yet tough and\r\ncocking in rather tall and slender cocks so that the air may get at the\r\nhay. Do not delay raking until the hay is dry or you will lose many of\r\nthe leaves, and they are worth as much, pound for pound, as wheat bran.\r\n\r\nThe hay may cure in the cocks if the weather is fine, or they may be\r\nopened out and sunned and again piled up and hauled to the barn. When\r\nonly a few tons are put together the hay must be pretty dry else it may\r\nmould. When putting many tons in one rick or mow the hay need not be so\r\nwell dried, as the heat prevents moulding.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa hay will keep well in mow or rick, but when ricked it must be\r\ncovered with wild grass, straw or boards, as it will not shed rain well.\r\nThere will be four cuttings the second year, and these should be taken\r\noff when the proper stage of growth has been reached, whether the alfalfa\r\nis long or short. When it begins to bloom, the leaves to rust, and buds\r\nappear on the bases of the stems, it must be cut, else it will cease to\r\ngrow and no subsequent crop need be looked for.\r\n\r\nIf, perchance from drought, the second or third crop happens to be very\r\nshort, it must be mown off as promptly as though it was a good growth and\r\nthen the succeeding crop, should there be rain, may be very much heavier\r\nthan the poor one removed. Had it not been cut, however, this good crop\r\nwould not have been secured.\r\n\r\nOn land rightly prepared, with favorable seasons of sufficient rain,\r\nalfalfa in the South may yield as much as six or eight tons to the acre.\r\nA yield of four to five tons may more confidently be expected.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will endure in profitable condition on suitable soils for from\r\nsix to twelve years. Grasses encroach upon it and may be destroyed by\r\ndisking after the roots are tough enough to endure it. A spike-toothed\r\nharrow to follow the disk will more surely tear out the grass. The harrow\r\nwill not injure the alfalfa roots.\r\n\r\nWhen once well established an annual drilling in of liberal amounts of\r\nphosphorus and potash will greatly stimulate growth on most soils and be\r\nrepaid several times over in the increased yield.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to plow the field it may be turned with a very sharp\r\nplow and strong team and the roots are readily killed when cut off. Any\r\ncrop will yield very abundantly after alfalfa, corn and tobacco being\r\nperhaps best suited to follow alfalfa, since small grain may lodge\r\nbecause of the exceeding richness of the land.\r\n\r\nAfter one or two crops have been taken off of the land it should again be\r\nmanured and sown to alfalfa, which will take much more readily and yield\r\nmuch more abundantly than it did the first sowing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I ask the farmers of the South not to sow alfalfa upon\r\npoor or unprepared soil or in a wrong manner, since by so doing, failure\r\nis almost assured and the whole cause of alfalfa culture will receive\r\na serious setback. I believe, however, that wherever a man has learned\r\nto grow alfalfa he will rejoice all his days and be the richer, more\r\nintelligent and better man for it and his neighborhood will be helped by\r\nthe example of good farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Old Wash Died\r\n\r\nBY JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not seen the old man for several months, but I supposed he was\r\nstill prospering on his little farm, when he walked in the other day\r\nwithout knocking, took his seat by the fire, and casually remarked that\r\nMarch was always a bad month on rheumatism.\r\n\r\n“Why, how are you, old man?” I said, laying down my pen and seeing him\r\nfor the first time. “I haven’t seen you for several months.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t reck’n you is,” he said quietly, “an’ de reason is, I ain’t\r\nseed myself—I’ve been dead!”\r\n\r\n“What!” I exclaimed—“dead—are you joking?”\r\n\r\nI looked at him closely, but I saw no evidence of insanity—nothing to\r\nindicate that he had yet reached his dotage. However, I thought it best\r\nto pass him something for his rheumatism. He quaffed it off so naturally\r\nthat I knew he was all right and would tell it in his own way.\r\n\r\n“Ennything happened ter speak of sense I be’n dead?” he asked,\r\nindifferently enough, as he smacked his lips and wiped them on the back\r\nof his hand.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to hear how he had died, but I knew any eagerness on my\r\npart would spoil it all, so I replied:\r\n\r\n“Why, no, old man—nothing new. But you have heard of Jupiter Pluvius,\r\nperhaps, and his home above the clouds. Well, he has kept busy this\r\nspring with his watering pot.”\r\n\r\n“Heard of ’im?” asked the old man, with a show of wrath—“why, I knowed\r\n’im—he was a blue-gum nigger—that Jupiter was—that c’u’d pick five\r\nhundred pounds o’ cotton in a day, an’ he run off wid my secon’ wife an’\r\njined de Yankees. But he didn’t lib whar you placed de rickerlicshun ob\r\nhis cohabitashun—he libbed up on Bear Creek. No, I got no hard feelin’s\r\nabout it—for, onbeknownst to hisse’f he done me a great favor. No, I\r\nain’t got nothin’ ag’in’ him, nur de Yankees, nur’r.”\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” I said, “for since the Spanish war we are all Yankees now.”\r\n\r\n“All Yankees now? Jes’ lemme tell you, sonny, dah’s one dat ain’t. No,\r\nsuh, I am a S’uthern gemman, an’ I still b’leeves de nigger was made to\r\nbelong to somebody dat ’uld feed ’im an’ mek ’im beehave. All Yankees\r\nnow? Boss, I sho’ am ’shamed of you! De naixt thing you’ll hab us all\r\nJews or Japs. Wal, dat’s all right, but I b’leeves I told you ’bout\r\nco’rtin’ dat ’ar widder—”\r\n\r\n“You got her, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Boss, did you urver kno’ ennybody to go after a widder an’ not get her?\r\nI’ve got jes’ one rule fur co’rtin’—set up close, agree on all p’ints,\r\nan’ dat’ll fetch on love. Never ’spute wid a widder, ’specially ef you’re\r\nc’ortin’ her. Wait twell you’re marri’d an’ den bu’st a wash-bo’rd over\r\nher haid ef she don’t beehave.\r\n\r\n“Did you urver notice, boss, how cu-is a widder is about dat ur c’ortin’\r\nbus’ness? So diff’unt frum a gal. Now, when you co’rt a gal, she ain’t\r\ngwine say nuffin’ fur a long time. She let you co’rt her an’ co’rt her,\r\nan’ sum day, when she fin’ she lubs you, she’ll jes’ thro’ her arms\r\naroun’ you’ neck an’ say, ‘Darlint, I am your’n—take me!’\r\n\r\n“But wid a widder, nobody ain’t nurver got one of ’em to say ‘yes’\r\nyit—but dey manage to git dar all de same.\r\n\r\n“An’ dat wus de way wid dis heah widder I co’rted. De fus’ night I went\r\nto see her she ’lowed she hated de very groun’ I walked on, yet she\r\nlemme hol’ her han’ all de time. De nex’ night I was wuss’n p’lzen, yet\r\nshe lemme squeeze her. De third time I was meaner ’n dog-fennel, yet I\r\nwas good enuff to hug her. De nex’ time I cum she ’lowed I wus de mos’\r\ncontempt’us, po’ ignoble, bandy-legged has-been dat ever was, an’ stell I\r\nsho’ did kiss her. De las’ night she fix me—I didn’t think she’d hab me\r\nto save my life, an’ like a fool I begged her wuss’n a little weaned calf\r\nbeggin’ fur milk. Dat wus jes’ whut she was layin’ fur, an’ so, entirely\r\nonbeknownst to me, she had de preacher wid de license dar hid in de\r\ncloset, an’ I sw’ar ter goodness, boss, befo’ de cock crow twice dat ’ar\r\n’oman had marri’d me thrice!\r\n\r\n“An’ den I died,” he added solemnly. “Yes, boss, I died dead, too. You\r\nsee, it all happen’ at de weddin’ supper. You see, boss, de ole man had\r\nallers been used ter drinkin’ sho’ nuff licker, but dat night dey dose me\r\nup wid a konkoction of pine-top, asserfederty an’ buzzard’s bre’f, an’\r\nfo’ I knowed it I wus dead. Why, boss, dey burried me on de fus’ Sat’d’y\r\narter de secon’ Sunday in January, an’ I didn’t rise ergin ’twell de\r\nChusday arter de secon’ Sunday in March, an’ ef dat whiskey hadn’t er bin\r\nes good in its raisin’ grace as ’twas in its fallin’ grace, I’d er bin\r\ndar yit.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to kno’ what a man sees, an’ how he feels arter he’s\r\ndead, boss?”\r\n\r\nWould I? I gave the old man another dose of the heaven-brewed to help him\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n“Wal, hit’s about de cu-isest feelin’ dat eber was felt,” he said, after\r\nawhile. “One minnit you am libin’ an’ de nex’ you am trablin’ ’long de\r\nroad to Jurdan, an’ you can’t he’p yo’self to save yo’ life. You can’t\r\nstop, you can’t sot down, you can’t turn back. You jes’ seem to be drawed\r\nalong like you was standin’ on a slidin’ sidewalk run on undergroun’\r\ncables. But de road is buterful. Flowers bloom all aroun’ you. Birds\r\nsing in de sunshine on gold trees, an’ fishes swim in lakes of melted\r\ndi’monds. Inste’d of bein’ outdoors an’ breathin’ air, you ’peer to be\r\nmovin’ along under de bright roof ob a cut-glass house, or in a big\r\nbottle ob rarerfied perfume, wid de sun a blazin’ stopper in de roof.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t kno’ whar I wus gwine to, an’ I didn’t keer—all I know’ wus I\r\nwus gwine, thang Gord!\r\n\r\n“But, bimeby, everthing stop whar two roads met, an’ I know’d one of ’em\r\nwent to heab’n, but I cudn’t say which one to save my life. I got down on\r\nmy knees, an’ prayed fur light, but no light cum, an’ ’stid of it I heurd\r\nall de little birds singin’ in de gold trees all aroun’ me:\r\n\r\n    “‘If you foller the road of sorrer an’ sin,\r\n    An’ don’t pray fur light in de wurl’ you am in,\r\n    No use fur to pray in de nex’.’\r\n\r\n“Dat mos’ par’lyze me, boss, an’ I’d a gi’n ennything ef I hadn’t spent\r\nso much time aroun’ race-tracks whilst I wus alive an’ had spent mo’ of\r\nit lookin’ for dis heah track, an’ tryin’ to fin’ out which road to take.\r\nDar dey bofe lay, jes’ alike, shinin’ in de glow of eternity. An’ yit de\r\nvery silence seem ter speak in thunder-tones, an’ de stillness was louder\r\ndan de noise of battle. It all depended on de path I tuck.\r\n\r\n“Bimeby, I thort of Ole Marster’s little boy dat I seed die so long ago,\r\nan’ dat I useter nuss an’ carry in my arms, an’ of all de little chillun\r\nI seed bohn one day, an’ die de nex’, an’ I got down on my knees in de\r\ngolden dust ob dat ’ar road an’ I look fur ter see if dar was enny baby\r\ntracks dar, fur I knowed whar de baby tracks wus, dat wus de road dat\r\nleads to heab’n.”\r\n\r\nThe old man stopped, and I saw him brush away a tear. He had said\r\nsomething as great as Shakespeare, and I, myself, had to take a turn\r\naround the room to stop before the picture of a little curly-head over\r\nthe mantel, and listen again for the prattle of a laughter which began\r\none spring with a bird’s note and ended with the first snow in a new-made\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back, the old man was laughing. Tears—smiles—twins that dwell\r\nin the secret chambers of the heart, and they join hands so quickly at\r\ntimes!\r\n\r\n“Bimeby,” he went on, “I look up de road, an’ heah cum ole Kunnel\r\nKetchum, er-splittin’ de dust ob de golden road, an’ a-moppin’ his ole\r\nbald head wid a red bandanna handkerchief, an er-lookin’ es pi’us in\r\ndeath as he was sancterfied in life. Now, boss, you kno’ de Kunnel was\r\none ob dese here prayin’ lawyers—dat you kin always safely brand as De\r\nDebbil’s Own—an’ he died jes’ ’fo’ I did, an’ he wus awful smart an’\r\nawful slick, an’ whilst I didn’t hab much idee he knowed enny mo’ ’bout\r\nde road to heab’n dan I did, I was bankin’ on his ’bility to find it out\r\nfust.\r\n\r\n“‘Hello, Wash,’ sezee, ‘which way you gwine?’\r\n\r\n“Sez I: ‘Kunnel, I’m cogertatin’ on which ob dese heah roads leads to\r\nheab’n.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh,’ sez he, ‘I kin show you which road ter take. I dun bin up dar\r\nan’ file my brief wid Jedge Peter at de gate, but dar wus some leetle\r\nirregularerties in de pleadings, an’ I’ve come back to answer his demur.’\r\n\r\n“Den he laugh, an’ say: ‘Wash, de ole feller don’t kno’ a little bit o’\r\nlaw, an’ hit’s de easiest thing in de wurl’ to wuck him ef you’ll only\r\ndo es I say. Now, when I went up an’ presented him my church papers, an’\r\ntole ’im who I wus, deac’n an’ all dat, he ’lowed he nurver had larned\r\nto read English an’ he throwed my papers over a bluff, whar I seed some\r\nsmoke risin’ an’ swellin’ sorter like de smoke ob a passin’ freight\r\nengine, an’ den he look at me an’ ax if I wus ridin’ or walkin’? Sez I,\r\n“Sir, I am walkin.” “Dat settles it,” sez he, “nobody erfoot will urver\r\ngit in dis gait, and es fur dat artomobeel crowd,” sez he, “dey go on\r\nto hell widout stoppin’, fur dey carry de scent of hell erlong wid ’em,\r\nennyhow. No, sah, Kunnel,” sez he, “you gotter ride a hoss to git into\r\nheah. We need ’em to pull de cherriots in heaben”—an’ de Kunnel look wise\r\nan’ stroke his chin-whiskers.\r\n\r\n“‘Now, Wash,’ he went on, soft-like, ‘I’ve got a plan my color’d frien’\r\ndat ull fix ole Peter an’ let us bofe in.

So I got down on my all-fo’s, de Kunnel he mounted me,\r\nan’ I started up de pike in a jog trot. But I hadn’t gone fur befo’ de\r\nole Kunnel punch me in de side wid his heels, yanked my mouf nearly off\r\nwid de gallus bridle an’ de shoestring bit he fixed up fur me befo’ he\r\nstarted, an’ yelled out:\r\n\r\n“‘Change dat gait, you ole fool, do you think I would ride into heab’n on\r\na trottin’ hoss when I c’u’d ride a easy pacer?’\r\n\r\n“I seed de pint, an’ shifted.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, dat’s better,’ sez he, ‘an mo’ restful.’\r\n\r\n“At de gate Marse Peter stop us, an’ say: ‘Am you ridin’ or walkin’ suh?’\r\n\r\n“‘Ridin’ dis time, yo’ Honoh,’ sey de Kunnel.\r\n\r\n“‘Good,’ sez Peter, a-glancin’ at me, ‘but I don’t like de looks ob dat\r\nswayback scrub you’re ridin’, so I’ll jes’ let you hitch ’im to de fence,\r\nbut you kin walk in!’\r\n\r\n“An’ de ole Kunnel, he hitch me to de fence sho’ ’nuff, an’ walked in\r\nwidout battin’ his eye or sayin’ much obleeged, an’ dar I wus champin’\r\na shoestring bit, tied to de fence ob heab’n, wid a gallus line, an’\r\ndodgin’ a hoss-fly es big as a turkey gobbler dat wus buzzin’ aroun’ over\r\nde bluff nigh-by.\r\n\r\n“Peter look at me a long time, sorter smilin’ an’ sorter mad, an den he\r\nsez: ‘Thort you’d fool me, did you? Wal, for dis decepshun, I’ll turn you\r\ninto a sho’ nuff hoss,’ and befo’ I c’u’d say scat, boss, I wus a black\r\nHal pacer, wid two white feet, a star, snip, black mane and tail, so\r\nhelp me Gord, an’ dat ’ar hoss-fly es big es a turkey was buzzin’ aroun’\r\ntryin’ to bore a hole in me.\r\n\r\n“Gimme anurver dram, boss.”\r\n\r\nI thought he was entitled to it.\r\n\r\n“But dat wa’n’t all. F’um dat day on dey didn’t do nuffin’ but use me on\r\ndat road, carryin’ folks up to de gate, but nurver gittin’ in myse’f.\r\nAn’ dey wucked me ’twell I almos’ drapped dead ag’in.

An’ dar I seed folks I nurver dreamed ’u’d be dar,\r\nin dis wurl’, an’ I failed ter see udders dat I thort ’u’d be dar on de\r\nhottes’ gridiron. Dar wus heathens a-wonderin’ what it all meant, an’\r\nChristians still ’sputin’ on baptism an’ santerfercashun, an’ ev’ry one\r\nob ’em, boss, a-holdin’ a fat Afercan heathen ’twixt him an’ de fiah.\r\nGreeks, Turks, niggers, Jews, Spanyards—all dar, boss. Dar wus doctors,\r\nstill a-lyin’ an’ lookin’ wise, an’ when de yudders called fur water\r\nde debbil had ’em to dose ’em wid quinine an’ calermel, or cut open\r\nde reel bad men huntin’ fur de ’pendix. Lawyers? Boss, if hell only\r\nhad a bookcase an’ a dirty carpet, cuspedores an’ a sweatin’ lot ob\r\nbad-smellin’ jurors, you’d a-thort it wus some ord’nary co’te-house wid a\r\nfiah attachment. In one corner dey had penned off a lot ob ole wimmens,\r\nall talkin’ an’ argyin’ at onct, an’ I ax Peter whut dey wus, an’ he sed\r\ndey wus de muthers ob de wives ob men, an’ dey had to be penned off dar\r\nter keep ’em frum runnin’ de place an’ bossin’ it deyselves.\r\n\r\n“Dey wus all dar, boss—all but de babies, as I wus tellin’ you. Nurver\r\ndid I heah de wail ob a little one come up frum de pit, nur de lisp ob\r\na lullerby turned into moan. Fur de sweetes’ nurse dat eber a baby had,\r\nhad sed, whilst He was on earth, ‘De little chillun I’ll take keer of\r\nthem’—an’ dey had all gone to Him.\r\n\r\n“Day arter day I seed dis; day arter day I carried nations on my back\r\nfrom de partin ob de two ways to de gate whar Peter stood, ’till I prayed\r\nto die ag’in.\r\n\r\n“An’ one day, when I thort I c’u’dn’t stan’ it no longer, dar come along\r\na smilin’, quiet man, wid a kind look in his eyes. An’ dey tole him to\r\nmount me an’ ride me up to de hill. But he looked me all ober, my puffed\r\nlegs an’ sore feet an’ sweat-caked sides an’ drawn flank, an’ he said:\r\n‘No—no—I wouldn’t ride into heab’n on the miz’zry ob a dumb beast.’\r\n\r\n“An’ he fotch me some water to squench my thirt, an’ he tuck off de\r\nsaddle an’ bathe my back, an’ he led me slowly up de hill. An’ when we\r\ncome to de gate, Peter looked at ’im pow’ful ’stonished, an’ sed:\r\n\r\n“‘Who am you, suh, dat w’u’d choose ter walk ter heab’n when you mout\r\nride?’\r\n\r\n“An’ den de man look at ’im quiet lak, an’ say, ‘I am nuffin heah, my\r\nLord, an’ it matters not whut my name am.

An’ so loving\r\nthem, I would not ride eben to heaben’s gate on de miz’zry ob enny beast\r\nthat Gord has made.’\r\n\r\n“An’ den dar cum a burst ob music de lak of which no man eber heurd\r\nbefo’, an’ a buterful gate on a ribber I nurver seed befo’ was flung\r\nwide open, an’ a voice sed: ‘Righteousness an’ truth hab met toguther.\r\nWhatsoever you did unto one ob dese you do it also unto me.’\r\n\r\n“An’ Peter waved his han’ an’ de man was clothed in white an’ light, an’\r\nwent in de glory gate—de onlies’ one ob dem all dat went in, an’ I seed\r\ndat yudder gate dat ole Kunnel Ketchum an’ all went in wusn’t heab’n at\r\nall, but jus a side entrance to hell—an’ es he went in he waved his han’\r\nat me’ an’ sed: ‘Go back ag’in to earth an’ learn to lub all things dat\r\nGord hes made, an’ yo’ na’bur as yo’se’f,’ an’ befo’ I knowed it I stood\r\nin my grabe-clothes in de woods of Bigby, lookin’ fust at de grabe at my\r\nfeet an’ den at de skies above me, an’ wonderin’ whut hed happen sence I\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\nThe queer turn the old man gave to his story set me to thinking, and the\r\nhidden lesson touched me so greatly I could not reply. To throw off its\r\nweirdness, I finally said:\r\n\r\n“Well, what had become of the widder?”\r\n\r\n“I tole you I wus dead nigh six weeks. My wife, she’d marri’d ag’in,\r\nthank Gord, whilst I wus dead!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ghost, Cassandra\r\n\r\nBY J. MADISON SHEPPARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe servants—overhearing the eager, excited footman’s message to the\r\nyoung mistress—had gathered hurriedly upon the rear porch to inspect\r\nthe new arrival; cook, kitchen-maid, butler, flanked on one side by the\r\nparlor-maids, and on the other by a small errand boy, who peeped in\r\nopen-mouthed wonder from beneath the elbow of the waiting footman.\r\n\r\nThe new arrival was a beautiful white mare. She had quickly thrown her\r\nhead upward, and now stood at gaze—regarding them. Alert, ardent, with\r\na slight distinguishable tremor of expectancy, but no trace of fear in\r\neither posture or regard—merely bright inquiry.\r\n\r\n“She was the incarnation of the Arab of romance;” lithe, delicately\r\ntapering limbs, satin skin shimmering in the sunlight, pink nostrils\r\nflaring wide from her quick breath, eyes glowing with intelligence, and,\r\nwithal, a thing of beauty, standing, as it were, transfixed in passionate\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhen the mistress of the house at last came down the great wide stairway,\r\nthe group fell back forming a semi-circle, leaving her face to face with\r\nthe bright object of interest.\r\n\r\n“So that is the horse,” she said, in faint astonishment, which, however,\r\ngrew gradually into an expression of pure admiration and wonder; for the\r\nbeauty she beheld was little short of marvelous.\r\n\r\nShe turned suddenly to the servants with a perplexed gesture. “Is the\r\nbrougham at the door?” she asked. The footman signified that it was.\r\n“Tell Thomas to come here.” The coachman a moment later had fixed his\r\neyes upon the newcomer that had attracted the group. At length, his\r\ndecorous gravity gave way to a smile of distinct pleasure, expressive of\r\nthe praise that seemed to tremble upon his lips; but, he remained silent,\r\na martyr to his training, his very features admirably correct.\r\n\r\n“Is that a well-bred horse, Thomas?” demanded the young mistress.\r\n\r\n“It certainly is, ma’am, if looks count for anything,” replied Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Very well bred?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure ma’am, the creature must be perfectly so; I’ve never seen\r\nanything so fine ma’am, ’pon my word,” he continued, the swelled veins of\r\nhis forehead betraying his stifled enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean by that, Thomas, you have never seen that horse before?”\r\n\r\nThomas hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Say what you wish to say, Thomas,” prompted the young mistress, with a\r\nhasty glance at his face.\r\n\r\n“Thanky, ma’am. Well, you know, ma’am, that your lawyer, sometime last\r\nfall, had the poor master’s trainer sell off some of the horses from his\r\nstable. I’m sure, ma’am, that this is the one the trainer complained so\r\nmuch of selling, but Mr. Grannan had offered a big price, and the lawyer\r\nmade him sell her.”\r\n\r\nShe had already stepped forward to caress the eager, gazing animal,\r\ntimidly, for she could not resist the earnest, entreating look it\r\nbestowed, but, when Thomas spoke the word “master,” she drew back sharply\r\nand stood motionless.\r\n\r\n“Never fear, ma’am,” said the coachman, “she won’t harm, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“So, it’s Mr. Grannan’s horse,” she repeated coldly; and then, hastily\r\nturning, she passed through the house to the front door, which the boy,\r\nanticipating her intention, with much dignity now held open. A moment\r\nlater she had descended the steps, and was in her brougham with Thomas\r\nupon the box, and the austere footman gazing expectant at the window.\r\n\r\n“To my lawyer’s office,” she said, calmly.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n“The spring sunshine gilded the tops of the park trees. Here and there\r\nthe branches of the tall elms spread their tinted green; while the maples\r\nand chestnuts glowed in almost the full glory of their new leaves.”\r\nScarlet blossoms, on the otherwise apparently naked shrubs bedded in\r\nthe green lawns, facades of the brown stone mansions and glass-fronted\r\nshops, could be seen everywhere, on either side of the drive.\r\n\r\nThe scenes through which she now passed—looking upon, yet seeing\r\ndimly—aroused within her a miserable consciousness that the memory of her\r\nhusband, who had once so much loved these very scenes, had also faded\r\nwith the spring gladness into an amazing dimness.\r\n\r\nSo Grannan had sent her the horse! In the first year of her widowhood she\r\nhad, by chance, met Grannan. It was on the occasion of the anniversary\r\nof her twenty-second birthday. She had a relative—an old aunt—who had\r\nvisited her from San Francisco. She knew Grannan in her home there,\r\nand, meeting him in the city had invited him to her house to dine. In\r\nthe beginning of the second year of her widowhood, Grannan had offered\r\nhimself; but, the look that she had then given him, froze the declaration\r\nof love upon his lips, and caused him to feel and know the utter\r\nhopelessness of his offer. She had not seen him since then. And now, just\r\nat the end of the second year of widowhood, he had offered her the gift.\r\n\r\nShe had, at first, intended to keep it. Her husband had been intensely\r\ndevoted to horses, and she, through his influence had cultivated a\r\nfondness she had always had for them, and which had steadily increased;\r\nbut, the words of Thomas caused her to dismiss any idea she might have\r\nentertained toward harboring the gift.\r\n\r\nThe brougham stopped in front of the lawyer’s office. Presently that\r\ngentleman stepped forward and greeted her at the window. He soon verified\r\nthe truthfulness of the statement of Thomas concerning the sale, adding\r\nthat, despite the vehement protests of the trainer, he had deemed it\r\nunwise to reject the very extraordinary offer of Mr. Grannan.\r\n\r\nMr. Grannan, though, he continued, was known as an exceptionally fine\r\njudge of horses, and enjoyed a most enviable reputation among horsemen\r\nfor the prodigious success his skill had achieved for him.\r\n\r\nShe informed him of her determination now, to absent herself from the\r\ncity for perhaps an unusual time, and requested that all necessary\r\nletters of credit should be at once prepared and forwarded to her.\r\n\r\nThen, signaling the footman and designating the cathedral, she bade the\r\nattorney adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWalter Grannan, who was conversing with some of his fellow-members at the\r\nclub, which was situated on a corner near the cathedral, was now coming\r\nhastily forward towards her, just as she had alighted from her brougham\r\nand ordered it not to await her, saying, she would walk home.\r\n\r\n“It is very fortunate—at least for me,” he said. “I did so want to see\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I am going away to-morrow, and—of course it’s about the horse,” she\r\nsaid, pleasantly.\r\n\r\nHe smiled as he noted the charm of her face. “I am to hope; then, that\r\nyou will accept her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I just can’t,” she said, “while I must thank you so much for\r\nasking me.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment she was sorry almost that she had said it. His expression\r\ntouched her; and, though she could not satisfy herself why she should\r\ncare—what were the expressions of men’s faces to her?—still, the twit was\r\nthere. She felt it keenly as she now gazed steadfastly ahead, as they\r\nwalked slowly and silently along in the direction of the marble church.\r\n\r\n“I also am decided to go away to-morrow,” she said, at length, in a quiet\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nNothing was said in reply.\r\n\r\nThe great spire of the cathedral towered above her. The tones of the\r\norgan came throbbing from within. A funeral cortege entered. There was a\r\ncoffin, piled high with wreaths of flowers. There the same dread pomp and\r\ncircumstance of death that was attendant upon her husband. She shuddered\r\nas she turned aside her head.\r\n\r\nYes! Yes! She would go—go to-morrow. She must go! In her nervousness her\r\nhandkerchief dropped from her hand.\r\n\r\nAs Grannan bent forward to pick it up, he observed a single white\r\nflower that had fallen from the wreaths piled upon the coffin, and\r\ngathered this in his hand also. He started to offer it to her; but,\r\nobserving the thoughtful, troubled look upon her face, refrained. They\r\nhad now stopped; and, a moment later when in a fit of abstraction\r\nhe was attempting to pinion the flower to the lapel of his coat, she\r\ninvoluntarily seized his hand.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHer face crimsoned as she instantly withdrew her hand, and struggled for\r\ncomposure. “Why—er, it’s bad luck,” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What’s bad luck?” asked he, with that peculiar tone of voice indicating\r\nthat there was no answer for his query.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing; silliness, mere nonsense,” she said, betraying signs of\r\nher agitation which Grannan, however, failed to discover. “And now,” she\r\ncontinued, “I must say good-bye, for you are going away, you say, and I\r\nmust thank you, oh, I can’t say how much, for your offer of the beautiful\r\nhorse.”\r\n\r\n“And, do you really mean that you will not accept my gift?” he said,\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip and bent her eyes downward, while she moved the point of\r\nher shoe restlessly upon the stone paving.\r\n\r\n“O, I might manage,” she at length began, hesitatingly, “if only to\r\ngratify your whim, to keep it, for a while; but—”\r\n\r\n“You see,” he interrupted, “I wanted you to have something to remind—”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” she repeated, smiling as she gave him her hand. “So you\r\nreally go away to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“At once,” he said, gravely, as he pressed the hand she was now\r\nwithdrawing from his own, and turned away.\r\n\r\nShe paused within the vestibuled entrance of the cathedral in what proved\r\nto be a vain endeavor to calm the turbulency of her feelings. The fingers\r\nof her gloved hand were still deadened by the pressure from which she had\r\njust released them. Her eyes had even mastered her will, and now sought\r\nwith the intensity of eagerness, the dim outlines of a figure that was\r\nnow lost amid the throng, now faintly visible, with its downcast head and\r\nslowly receding step. At last it vanished.\r\n\r\nThe unsteady, subdued, solemn tones of the great organ within again\r\nrolled tumultuously upon her. She stood struggling, as it were, with the\r\noverwhelming waves of sound. Both her eyes and memory seemed now to focus\r\nupon a receding past.\r\n\r\nThe dead face of her husband drifted from out the vacancy, so real that\r\nshe started, stopped, then started again, slowly descending the steps.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face homeward. Unconscious of the tide of restless\r\npassers-by, and of the noise that roared imprisoned by the walls of the\r\nhigh buildings on either side of the street, she turned abstractedly from\r\nthe square, lost in the depths of her meditations.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of her husband. Thinking of a day on the race-course;\r\nthe day upon which she had first met him. Of how she had then dreamed\r\nof his wonderful personality, and afterwards learned how easily and\r\ncompletely it had swayed her own. Of how untiring, faultlessly devotional\r\nhad been his constant care for her, and of how precisely perfect and\r\npleasureable had been their married life.\r\n\r\nShe grew desperate now, and upbraided herself distressingly to think that\r\nalready he should have become to her “nothing more vital than a memory.”\r\n\r\nYes, after all, she would go. She would go to the scene where she had\r\nfirst met him, to San Francisco; her husband’s stable of horses was now\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAs she entered leisurely the door of her home, and was met by her maid in\r\nthe hall, who relieved her of her wraps, she made known her intention of\r\nleaving on the morrow, and gave instructions to her to have everything in\r\nreadiness for their departure. She then went from the rear porch of the\r\nhouse in the direction of the coachman’s quarters, to notify Thomas to\r\nmake preparations desired. This, she had persuaded herself, was her real\r\nreason for going to the locality set apart for the horses; but, was it?\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Thomas been found than the very first question asked him\r\nwas pertaining to the welfare of his charge. A few moments later, it was\r\nshe who was gently caressing the milk-white, deer-head of the mare, with\r\nher soft hands, now stroking the shiny neck, now encircling it within her\r\narms, while the warm breath from the pink nostrils fanned at intervals\r\nher fair brow, sending a-whirl some truant lock of her wavy hair.\r\n\r\n“Thomas,” she now said, turning a face full of inquiry upon the\r\ncoachman, who had stood with a look of amazement, gazing upon the\r\nmanifest interest and affection of the young mistress, “what is her name?”\r\n\r\n“Well, ma’am,” he replied, assuming the air now of one who feels the\r\nimportance of being the proud possessor of some rare bit of information,\r\n“ever since she played in the paddock, three years ago now, by her\r\nmother’s side, and the master would come and take her little head in his\r\nhands, just as you have, ma’am, and pinch her cheeks, and laugh at her\r\nodd pranks, he called her Cassandra.”\r\n\r\n“Cassandra!” she repeated. “Then he must have loved her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed he did, ma’am, she was his favorite, and the trainer knew it,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Thomas, we start for San Francisco in the morning. You are to go, and\r\nhave in your especial care, Cassandra. When you have arrived there\r\ndeliver her again into the hands of the trainer, with instructions that\r\nthe best of attention be shown her.”\r\n\r\n“Thanky, ma’am,” said Thomas. “I’m proud of my charge, ma’am, indeed I\r\nam, for she’s a plum picture.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFive weeks passed. With her aunt beside her, and with Thomas upon the\r\nbox, the mistress was sweeping through a bright avenue in the far Western\r\ncity. The sky had forgotten the storm of the day before, and the splendor\r\nof a noonday sun now slept upon its bosom. Nature was smiling, but the\r\nsmile was not wholly in accord with the feelings of the mistress. A\r\nrestless, fitful mood had settled upon her in the early morning, and she\r\nhad ordered the drive, as she now frequently did, to the race course.\r\n\r\nHer aunt, strange to say, was not a very garrulous old lady, and the\r\ndark, foreboding thoughts which persistently crept into the mind of the\r\nmistress, so perplexed her that she appeared dull. Since her husband’s\r\ndeath she had acquired the habit of pursuing at will her train of\r\nthought, and now she could not easily break it, even in the presence of\r\nothers. Her thoughts now, as they had been much of late, were associated\r\nwith the little “Cassandra.” She was sorely vexed with the chiding she at\r\ntimes administered to herself for the strong, though, perhaps, strange\r\nattachment she felt to be growing dally within her.\r\n\r\nWas she then destined, as the very name would imply, to fall in love with\r\nCassandra? Was she indeed to be fascinated, lured to what had at first\r\nappeared to her the very shores of sin, “by the light of such wondrous\r\neyes?” Involuntarily she recalled the words of “Ouida;” “There are no\r\neyes that speak more truly, none on earth that are so beautiful as the\r\neyes of the horse—dark as a gazelle’s, soft as a woman’s, brilliant as\r\nstars, a little dreamy and mournful, infinitely caressing when they look\r\nat those they love.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped. They had reached the stables. Instead of awaiting,\r\nas usual, the appearance of the trainer, she found that she had alighted\r\nand hastily sought the compartment set aside for Cassandra; and, that\r\nit was her glossy, silvery little head, that was now swaying so gently\r\nwithin her arms. Memory again reverted to her husband. To the time when\r\nhis hands fondled the same head, his eyes sparkled at her playful pranks,\r\nhis lips uttered the word that had named her.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the trainer suddenly sounding in her ears startled her and\r\nshe turned rather abruptly toward him.\r\n\r\n“She’s improving, ma’am,” he said, after his usual salutation, “with\r\nevery day. The climate is telling on her, for she leaves a clean trough\r\nnow after each meal; and her speed—well, no longer than daylight this\r\nmorning she showed her heels for better’n a quarter to some of the very\r\nbest ones in the barn, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not intend to race her, do you?” she exclaimed. “She’s too\r\npretty and to much of a plaything, I should think, for that?”\r\n\r\n“True, she is a beauty, ma’am,” replied the trained, “but as for\r\nplaything”—he laughed aloud at the thought as he muttered brokenly—“well,\r\nif I can get the proper weight on her in that big handicap Saturday,\r\nand the track’s right, she might be about the most playful proposition\r\nthese cracks have yet got up against. And then, there ought to be a good\r\nprice, too.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you must not sell her.”\r\n\r\n“Sell her! I could have thumped that lawyer for selling her. No, ma’am; I\r\nmean there ought to be heavy odds against her in such company.”\r\n\r\n“Thomas tells me that Hildreth won yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“So she did, ma’am; but at short price, odds on, a favorite you know.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grannan, though,” he went on, “so his trainer told me, lost pretty\r\nheavily on his entry. He said he telegraphed him to place ten thousand on\r\nhis entry and that he, of course, lost it. Mr. Grannan’s been playing in\r\ntough luck all round, so they say.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Grannan’s name the mistress gave a perceptible start,\r\na shudder passed over her, and a moment later, with some stifled remarks\r\nshe ended the interview, and was moving away in her carriage.\r\n\r\nLong after she had retired to her apartments in the home of her aunt, did\r\nshe hear the words that had escaped the lips of the trainer, sounding\r\nwithin her ears. Grannan had had bad luck! The scene in front of the\r\ncathedral was again evolving in her mind. The funeral cortege, the coffin\r\npiled high with the floral wreaths. A sudden trepidation seized upon her.\r\nShe had again dropped the handkerchief. She saw the handsome face of the\r\ntall figure beside her bending forward to recover it and then gather the\r\nfatal flower.\r\n\r\nCould it be that Grannan’s fate—ill fortune, perhaps ruin—had been sealed\r\nby the fall of a handkerchief, as many another horseman’s had by the fall\r\nof a flag? And that handkerchief dropped by her hand? Could she then be\r\nunwittingly instrumental in the downfall which seemed to threaten him?\r\nThe thought distracted her. She arose from her seat and walked the floor\r\nof her room in a fit of petulancy. Her brain teemed with myriad vague\r\nand indescribable fancies. The fingers of her hand grew numb, deadened,\r\nas though she had but withdrawn them from his parting grasp. She saw the\r\nsame expression of his face that had touched her, when she had refused\r\nhis gift. The look of entreaty in his eyes as he turned away.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” she at length exclaimed aloud, muttering to herself strangely in\r\nher bewilderment. “Alas! alas! for the doctrines of pernicious fatalism.\r\nHow oft do we entangle ourselves in our own sophisms; and, after all,\r\nwhat poor strugglers we are in the eternal web of destiny. The devils\r\nmust, indeed, oft laugh out at the fool who has boasted wisdom.”\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSaturday morning dawned. Dashes of sunlight at length began to dart\r\nthrough the rifts in the lifting clouds. It had rained heavily during the\r\nnight, and the mistress, though she had ordered out her carriage for a\r\ndrive to the race course, felt that the condition of the track would, no\r\ndoubt, preclude the possibility of Cassandra’s start in the handicap. She\r\nremembered that the trainer had said, “if the track’s right.” However,\r\nshe must go. The spell, the fascination that drew her thither seemed\r\nirresistible. Her aunt persuaded her to remain for lunch; but one o’clock\r\nfound her gazing with intensity into the depths of the bewitching eyes,\r\nwhile she tenderly stroked the shapely little head that Cassandra had at\r\nsight of her thrust through the doorway of her apartment.\r\n\r\n“I was just starting,” said the trainer, who now addressed her, “for a\r\nlast inspection of the track before deciding what’s best to do. You know,\r\nma’am,” he continued, “this is to be a hard-fought race, and while I\r\nbelieve the little girl”—nodding at Cassandra—“is well conditioned to go\r\nthe route of a mile and a quarter, and will stand the punishment, still,\r\nin heavy going the chances are all against her. There’s Helen Orland,”\r\nhe went on, “and Empress and Annabel—the track to-day, ma’am’s to their\r\nliking.”\r\n\r\nThe trainer paused, for he could not help but note unmistakable traces of\r\ndisappointment on the face of the mistress.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing could have more delighted her now than merely the\r\nappearance of her “little pet” upon the track, if only to receive the\r\nwords of praise from the spectators she felt sure she would. But, as it\r\nwas a matter to be left entirely with the trainer, she now turned towards\r\nhim, and handed him a roll of bills from her purse, saying as she did so:\r\n“You are doubtless in need of money for expenses. I shall send Thomas to\r\nyou for your final decision.” So saying, she stepped into her carriage,\r\nwhich moved off in the direction of the clubhouse.\r\n\r\n“Gad!” said the trainer. “Five thousand dollars! This reminds me of old\r\ntimes, when the master was living. Only when he gave me a roll like this\r\nit was with instructions to keep my eyes on ‘Bookies,’ and make them keep\r\ntheir odds right.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd had now commenced to flow into the grounds in droves and\r\nbunches. As the mistress, calm and collected, swept down the top balcony\r\nof the clubhouse to a position that commanded a full view of the course,\r\nadmiring glances from every direction followed after her. Unattended as\r\nshe was, and with manner of complete reserve and composure, she seemed\r\nwholly absorbed with her own thoughts.\r\n\r\nSeated in a group just to her left, and but a few feet in front of her\r\nwas Colonel Townsend, an old gentleman, with Major Campbell and two\r\nothers—evidently horsemen, all earnestly engaged in a discussion of\r\nhorses and races in general.\r\n\r\nAs she sat listening—as she was compelled to do—to some of the\r\nloud-spoken utterances of the group, she surveyed with interest the\r\ncrowd below her, which was now growing larger and larger. She chanced to\r\nobserve a man and a boy walking slowly along the track over in front of\r\nthe stables.\r\n\r\nAdjusting her field glasses she saw that it was her trainer and jockey.\r\nThey appeared to be examining the track carefully, while the trainer\r\npointed to a spot along the outside rail. They then disappeared. As they\r\nwere leaving the track she could see the trainer shaking his head slowly,\r\nwith his eyes bent upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe pang of disappointment now rankled within her. She knew that\r\nCassandra’s start had been discussed and that it was abandoned. She\r\nhad never realized till now how thoroughly expectant she had been. Her\r\nthoughts took on the coloring of her insatiate longing with which she\r\nbattled. Her mind passed in review all the struggles, all the regrets,\r\nall the vague fancies it had conjured when coupled with the bare name\r\nCassandra.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” thought she, “my husband named her. She was his favorite. Why\r\nshouldn’t she be mine? I could not help my attachment. Besides, I’m sure\r\nit must have grown strong—as it has—on his account. How I had wished to\r\nsee her start, wished to hear her beauty praised by others!”\r\n\r\nThe band in the amphitheatre now struck up a lively air and the\r\nhorses entered for the first race passed for review before the judges\r\npreparatory to going to the post. A stranger, who came pressing his way\r\nalong the balcony until he had joined the group with Major Campbell,\r\nseated himself and looked intently at a programme he carried in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Major,” he asked, “what entry is this in the handicap that I hear them\r\ncall ‘the ghost’?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied the Major, “that is the little mare ‘Cassandra.’”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the name the mistress inclined her ear instantly.\r\n“That’s singular,” continued the stranger. “What’s the significance,\r\nMajor—or do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s the name the boys here at the track gave to her and by which\r\nshe is now generally known. You see,” he continued, “her owner, who was\r\ngreatly attached to her as a mere weanling, is now dead. Have you never\r\nseen her, sir?”\r\n\r\nThe stranger shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Well, she’s a little marvel of beauty, sir, a perfect dream; milk-white\r\nfrom tip to tip and as trim and shapely as a gazelle.”\r\n\r\n“Does she start this evening?” inquired the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Townsend told me but a while ago that he had just heard she would not\r\nstart.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” replied the stranger, “but after your description of her,\r\nMajor, I think I shall make a special trip to the stable to see her.”\r\n\r\n“You knew her owner, did you not?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“I can’t recall him,” said the stranger, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Why, he’s been with us often—a jolly good fellow he was, too, full of\r\nlife and—”\r\n\r\n“Was he married?” interrupted the stranger.\r\n\r\n“No—that is, I think not,” said the Major, “for I heard something once to\r\nthe effect that he was much in love with Judge Taggart’s daughter. By the\r\nway,” he continued, “that young lady is, I believe, married now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the stranger. “I knew her—Miss Cassie.”\r\n\r\n“They’re off!” came the shout from the crowd below, and instantly there\r\nwas a general careening of necks from the balcony. A minute later and the\r\ncrowd below surged toward the railing of the track and gathered about the\r\njudges’ stand, as the horses rushed toward the wire.\r\n\r\nThen there was a wild commotion, followed later by a general movement in\r\nthe direction of the “board pencilers.”\r\n\r\nThus the evening passed on, race by race, with a repetition of the usual\r\nscenes and events, until at last there sounded the bugle call for the\r\nhandicap.\r\n\r\nThere was a distinct bustle and stir now among the expectant throng,\r\nwhich said plainly that the race of the evening was about to come off.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Townsend,” asked the Major, “have you seen Grannan since his\r\narrival to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” responded the Colonel. “I had a short talk with him this morning.\r\nI’m sorry for Grannan,” he continued, “he has been singularly unlucky of\r\nlate, and he says there seems to be no end of it.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the name of Grannan the mistress leaned over and\r\nlistened. She had long been sitting motionless, stolid, oblivious to\r\neverything save her thoughts. Some one touched her upon the arm, and\r\nturning sharply, with a startled look in her face, she beheld the\r\noutstretched hand of Thomas, holding a batch of tickets.\r\n\r\n“The trainer said, ma’am, to tell you that he just could not help it,\r\nma’am; when he saw twenty to one posted against Cassandra’s chances,\r\nhe made the ‘pencilers’ rub it off, and here, ma’am are the tickets.\r\nMr. Grannan, he said, had placed a large sum on the Empress,” continued\r\nThomas, “and that he took the liberty to purchase pools on Cassandra at\r\nthe tempting odds.”\r\n\r\nShe clutched the tickets nervously in her hand and quickly thrust them\r\ninto her purse, trembling visibly as she did so.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Colonel Townsend, “we were speaking of Grannan. There is his\r\nmare now—Empress—out for the handicap. I think, though,” he continued,\r\n“that Helen Orland—Briggs’ mare—is going to have decidedly the best of it\r\nin the going to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Major, “I like Rosalind or Houston’s entry—Geraldine.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with Annabel?” chimed in the stranger. “There she is\r\nnow. She certainly looks a winner, and the distance just suits her.”\r\n\r\nA wild cheer now suddenly burst from the crowd as Helen Orland passed\r\nin front of the judges’ stand. She was evidently a favorite with the\r\nspectators, for the cheer was repeated.\r\n\r\n“Ho! ho!” shouted the Major. “She is going to start. There comes the\r\n‘little ghost.’”\r\n\r\nAnd simultaneously with his words, a bevy of swipes and stable boys set\r\nup a yell.\r\n\r\n“Mother of Moses!” ejaculated the stranger. “Major, but you were right.\r\nShe is a dream.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and a beautiful dream at that,” added the Major.\r\n\r\n“Evidently she’s no nightmare,” echoed a shrill voice from the crowd.\r\n\r\nPoor little Cassandra! She was prancing to the music of the band as\r\nproudly as a queen, tossing her dainty head from side to side as gamely\r\nand defiantly as a sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe mistress turned with a look, intense in its anxiety, to Thomas, who\r\nwas still standing, and thrusting her purse into his hand instructed him\r\nto hurry with it to Mr. Grannan, tell him what the trainer had done and\r\nsay to him that as he was Cassandra’s rightful owner she desired him to\r\ndo as he wished with purse and contents.\r\n\r\nThen lifting her glasses to her eyes with trembling hands, she scanned\r\neagerly the horses as they gathered at the post. Soon, from sheer\r\ntrembling and weakness, her hands dropped into her lap. Now, for the\r\nfirst time, she beheld Grannan with his back turned toward the track and\r\nsearching with an anxious gaze the balcony upon which she was seated.\r\n\r\nHe raised his glasses to his eyes and began slowly to sweep the crowd. As\r\nhe did this her head sank involuntarily upon her breast. The blood rushed\r\nto her face. She was abashed—painfully so. What had she done? Could she\r\nstop Thomas? Would that she had seen him before she had sent Thomas. Yet\r\nhe had placed a large sum on Empress. Thomas had said so. What if he\r\nshould lose? The thought chilled her. She shuddered violently. He has\r\nalready lost heavily. It may ruin him.\r\n\r\n“They’re off!” roared the throng, and then came the portentous silence.\r\nShe raised her eyes and saw the form of Grannan now facing with earnest\r\ngaze the approaching horses. On they came, as if some terror-inspiring\r\nobject had suddenly stampeded them.\r\n\r\n“Rosalind a neck, Lucinda a length, Helen Orland a head,” commenced the\r\nsong of the “caller,” from below.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and they were sweeping past the judges’ stand.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, with a manifest anxiety in the tone of his voice, now\r\nobserved that Annabel was lapped on Helen Orland and that Empress had\r\nmoved up well to the front. Lucinda, he said, had fallen back.\r\n\r\n“The ‘little ghost,’” said the Major eagerly, “keeps well up to the\r\nbunch, but she’s too small, though, too small.”\r\n\r\nAround the turn they whirled, till now the “caller” cried out: “At the\r\nhalf; Rosalind, a neck; Empress, half length; Annabel, a length; Helen\r\nOrland—”\r\n\r\n“Rosalind, it seems,” exclaimed the Major, “can’t shake them off. See,\r\nshe’s falling back. Empress leads now and both Helen Orland and Annabel\r\nare coming up on her.”\r\n\r\n“Look at the ‘little ghost,’” screamed a voice from the crowd as they\r\nwere rounding into the stretch.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but she’s swerved,” chimed in the stranger, “clear to the rail—too\r\nbad, too bad; she’s out of it now; but see the Empress, how determined\r\nshe is. The fight is on now and Annabel and Helen Orland are running as\r\na team. Look! they’re at her throat on either side.”\r\n\r\n“Into the stretch: Empress a head; Annabel, a head; Helen Orland—”\r\n\r\n“The Empress will win, sure!” said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Hold!” shouted the stranger. “Look at that! Look at that! They’ve bumped\r\ninto her. She’s off her stride.”\r\n\r\n“Annabel wins easy!” now shouted a chorus of voices from below.\r\n\r\n“But here! here! Look at the rail—at the rail!” yelled the stranger,\r\nas the crowd below took up the shout and roared: “The Ghost! The Ghost\r\nwins!” “No, it’s Annabel, Annabel!” shouted others, “it’s Annabel!”\r\n\r\nAnd thus they flashed under the wire. The crowd now surged around the\r\njudges’ stand. A living stream poured out from the amphitheater. Hideous\r\nscreams and yells rent the very air: “The Ghost!” “Annabel!” “Annabel!”\r\n“The Ghost!” “Annabel!” “Cassandra!” “Annabel!” while burning eyes\r\nstrained, eager to catch the number—No. 7. Cassandra had won.\r\n\r\nOne long, shrill, deafening shriek now pierced the air, then died away,\r\namidst a rudely descending shower of hats, parasols, and umbrellas. A mad\r\nrush for the “bookies,” and the race was ended.\r\n\r\nThe mistress still stood peering from the balcony as if paralyzed.\r\nHer eyes, now fixed, stared from features as pale and immovable as if\r\nwrought by the hand of a sculptor. Thomas stood tapping nervously upon\r\nthe sleeve of her dress, while his ungovernable heels played a tattoo\r\nupon the sounding floor. He was unheeded. He ventured a more violent tug,\r\nand the shapely figure swung slowly around as though poised on a pivot.\r\n“Cassandra’s won, ma’am!”\r\n\r\nHer lips moved, but the words were inaudible. Her eyes turned again, bent\r\nin the direction of the judges’ stand.\r\n\r\n“Have the judges said so, Thomas?”\r\n\r\n“Her number’s 7, ma’am,” and pointing to where the number hung, he said:\r\n“There’s the number. And here, ma’am,” he continued, gesturing wildly,\r\n“are the tickets. I couldn’t find Mr. Grannan, ma’am, and didn’t know\r\nwhat to do, so I lit in and pretty nigh backed Miss Cassie off them\r\nboards like I ’lowed Mr. Grannan would have done.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll go there at once—to the stables,” said the mistress.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fetch the carriage to the side entrance, here, ma’am, if you wish.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded assent as he hurried away. A familiar voice now caused her to\r\nlook up into the face of Grannan.\r\n\r\n“I must congratulate you,” he said, as he took her hand, “upon the\r\nvictory of little Cassandra, though I must say I never knew her by that\r\nname until now. I was utterly amazed,” he continued, “when I thought I\r\nhad recognized her. How delighted I am now to know that she won.”\r\n\r\n“I am just going to see Cassandra now; will you go with me?” asked the\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nA little later, when they were driving in the direction of the stables,\r\nshe turned to him and said: “I was awfully sorry it had been decided to\r\nstart Cassandra, when my coachman told me that you had an entry in the\r\nrace. Did she in any way hinder your chances for success?”\r\n\r\n“In no way whatever, I can assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Did you lose very heavily on Empress?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing that I could say would so much exceed my usual losses of\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever thought,” she asked, “of the flower that fell from the\r\nbier which you persisted in fastening to the lapel of your coat?”\r\n\r\n“Am I to be forever doomed, then, for that one perverse act?” he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. I believe, though, there is an old adage which they\r\nsay affords some consolation to those who recount their losses.”\r\n\r\n“And, pray, what is the adage?”\r\n\r\n“Let me see—I think it runs something like this: ‘Unlucky in sport, lucky\r\nin l—’”\r\n\r\nThe word died upon her lips. It was smothered by a kiss.\r\n\r\nThere was a low whinny near the window of the carriage now as it stopped,\r\nand little Cassandra was peering eagerly in, from beneath her gray\r\nblanket. The boy led her closer to the window; and, as the mistress\r\nclasped her head in her arms, Grannan clasped the mistress in his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of the Hals\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n(NOTE—In the beginning we promised our readers that the History of the\r\nHals would not be confined entirely to dry statistics, but would include\r\nstories of these horses, and practical information relating to other\r\nhorse matters. Hence, these two following papers—Editor)\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nIn reading your very interesting and instructive “History of the Hals”\r\nand your learned dissertation on the difference between the trot and\r\nthe pace, I am reminded of one of the most laughable and richest races\r\nI ever saw, and which has never been in print before. Understand that\r\nthirty-three years ago, when this true story happened, we did not know\r\nas much about the difference between the trot and the pace as we do\r\nto-day, and which was so ably illustrated in your preceding chapters.\r\nVery well—now, for the place: An Illinois town near the Indiana line.\r\n\r\nAbe Stickney and Bob Langdon, living in adjoining towns, were rival\r\ndealers in road and track horses in a small way. Some time before my\r\nstory opens Langdon, by a little shrewd, and, perhaps, not quite fair\r\ndealing, “singed” Abe for a couple of hundred, and the latter was “laying\r\nfor him,” as the saying goes. Abe was “game,” and never had uttered a\r\nword of complaint, but had kept up a “deal of thinkin’.” In other words,\r\nto use one from “The Bishop of Cottontown,” he “froze.”\r\n\r\nHe was over in Indiana one day, and at a county fair saw a horse of the\r\nBlue Bull family, called Hoosier Boy.\r\n\r\nIn order that your readers may better understand and appreciate this\r\nnarrative (for I am sure you know the peculiarities of the Blue Bulls), I\r\nwill explain that the Blue Bull family of horses originated in Indiana,\r\nthat little was known of the ancestors of the founder of the family, Blue\r\nBell No. 75, that the name was a combination derived from his peculiar\r\ncolor, and a nickname bestowed on him by his enemies, who called him\r\n“Prudens Bull,” but he turned out like the “Ugly Duckling,” and surprised\r\nhis friends and shamed his enemies by founding a remarkable family, and\r\nat one time, since I can well remember, he was the champion sire of 2:30\r\nspeed, some sixty in number. They were nearly all natural pacers, but as\r\npacers were not popular those days, they were made to trot by the use of\r\nheavy toe-weights.\r\n\r\nThe horse that Abe saw was taking his morning exercise and was a nice,\r\nsmooth-gaited pacer. In the afternoon, to his astonishment, he saw the\r\nsame horse win a trotting race in pretty good time. Abe investigated the\r\nmatter at once and found that he could buy the horse very reasonably, as\r\nhe was not quite sound, and he also learned that not a step would he trot\r\nwithout toe-weights, but would pace quite fast, though not nearly as fast\r\nas he could trot. The horse was shipped home with a bunch of others he\r\nhad bought, and Abe immediately began to lay his plans. He hired a fellow\r\nthat he could trust and sent him out to the fair grounds with his horse\r\nand then proceeded to Langdon’s town and communicated to Bob’s friends\r\nthat he had a horse that could beat anything in the county. That was\r\nenough, and Bob was looking for Abe and he did not have any trouble to\r\nfind him.\r\n\r\n“They tell me you have a regular streak o’ greased lightning, Abe?”\r\n\r\n“Who in thunder’s been lying to you, Bob. Ain’t got nothing but a cheap\r\none, but I would bet ten on a little race between Hoozier Boy and Gray\r\nDan just for fun, might make it twenty the day of race if my horse is all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nThe ten was soon posted, and the day set a week later, as Abe was on his\r\nway to Chicago to be gone a week.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Langdon, knowing that Abe was away, sent a couple of friends\r\nover to learn all they could about Hoosier Boy. They found the horse in\r\ncharge of a very sociable fellow.\r\n\r\nYes, that horse was a pacer, and he “lowed” he could step some. He was\r\ngoing to train him a little and they could see him step if they would\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nSo out came Hoosier Boy, and they saw him work a mile, and there was no\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nAbe’s man certainly was busy for his orders were that there might be a\r\nbuyer there while he was gone, and to show him the very best mile he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nBob’s friends timed him very carefully, and went home delighted. Gray Dan\r\ncould beat that time by eight seconds or more. That man of Abe’s was so\r\nobliging, too, and they gave him a nice tip, and asked him as a special\r\nfavor not to mention their visit, as they wanted to buy the horse as\r\ncheap as possible.\r\n\r\nThe race day came and found Abe gloriously drunk. ’Twas not a common\r\nthing, but it seemed to always happen when there was important business\r\non hand.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got much money,” said Abe, “but, by gol, I’ll bet that lower\r\neighty of mine agin a thousand dollars—never did like that farm—lost the\r\nbest cow I ever owned in that pesky swamp.”\r\n\r\nAbe had plenty of friends, and they gathered round trying every way\r\nto prevent his losing that farm. They knew him for a man that never\r\nwhimpered when he lost his money, and Bob Langdon was a “sharper.”\r\n\r\n“Skin ye, sure, Abe,” they said. But Abe turned a deaf ear to their\r\nentreaties.\r\n\r\n“I’m runnin’ my own business. ’G’lang’ away and let me be.” And the money\r\nwas soon up, and the farm, too, and they repaired to the fair grounds\r\nfor the race. When they arrived they found that very “accommodating\r\nfellow” getting Hoosier Boy ready for the race. A good-sized chunk of\r\nlead adorned the toes of his front feet, but as Bob and his friends never\r\nnoticed it, and even if they had would never have minded it, since the\r\ngreatest of pacers often wear toe-weights, they only nudged each other\r\nand prepared to soak it to poor Abe the harder.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Abe was drunk—or appeared so—and, much to the disgust of his\r\nfriends, staggered around trying to get up more bets on Hoosier Boy. Then\r\nhis friends begged, expostulated. They even threatened to take him home\r\nforcefully and declare the race off because one of the parties was too\r\ndrunk to have justice done him. But Abe dodged them and claimed police\r\nprotection from the crowd who were backing Gray Dan and preparing to rob\r\nhim on a dead certainty.\r\n\r\nFinally, they sent for Abe’s wife to come and save her husband’s\r\n“lower eighty.” But the good lady only told them to attend to their\r\nown business, and that Abe never was as drunk as he seemed, and while\r\nthey were gone Abe managed to borrow a thousand more by giving a bill\r\nof sale, if he lost, on Hoosier Boy and twenty head of steers he had!\r\nThen, to their disgust, he did more—he put up his homestead against\r\nanother thousand on the ground that he wanted to lose it, because his\r\nmother-in-law always stayed there. As this was all in the world he\r\nhad—the eighty acres, the steers and the horse, and the homestead—and the\r\nGray Dan crowd could find no one else who would put up at any odds, they\r\ncalled for the race and sat down to enjoy the fun.\r\n\r\nThe horses came out and scored for the race, and still the Gray Dan crowd\r\nsuspected nothing. It was dead easy. Hadn’t they seen Hoosier Boy do his\r\nbest, and paced in 2:24, and couldn’t Gray Dan pace in 2:16 or better?\r\n\r\n“Po’r Abe,” said all of Abe’s friends, as they got behind fences and\r\nposts to keep from seeing the robbery.\r\n\r\nOn the second score they got away—at least, Hoosier Boy did—so far away\r\nfrom Gray Dan that he was at the half before the Gray Dan crowd saw that\r\nhe was not pacing at all, but trotting to beat the band.\r\n\r\nHe finished the mile in 2:13. They forgot to time Gray Dan, who was so\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\nBob and his crowd fell off their perch in disgust and left their money\r\nwith the stake-holder. Abe still owns the lower eighty, and sundry\r\ncitizens of that locality have resolved that whenever they bet again how\r\nfast a horse can go, they will stipulate whether it be trot or pace.\r\n\r\n                                                             M. R. HIGBEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Horseshoeing.\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nIn a foot-note to my article in your February number, you said, “We will\r\ngladly publish your ideas on horseshoeing,” thus letting the bars down,\r\nknowing, perhaps, that I would be liable to wander in.\r\n\r\nIf I could turn backward in my career twenty or thirty years, I would\r\nundertake the task with more confidence in my ability to furnish\r\nsomething worthy of a place in your columns. I was young in the business\r\nthen. I had finished my apprenticeship, and felt sure that the few things\r\nI did not know relative to the farrier’s art were not worth considering.\r\nSince then, I have been a regular attendant in the great free school of\r\nexperience, taught by that merciless teacher, Necessity, and while I have\r\nbeen fairly successful in trying to furnish unnatural protection to that\r\npart of the horse which comes in contact with the earth, I am still in\r\nneed of the necessary amount of conceit that would enable me to pose as a\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nI trust you will allow me to ramble around back and forth between the\r\nhorseshoer and the horse-owner (one as much to blame as the other when\r\nthe “family pet” goes lame), and I feel confident of being able to\r\nbenefit some one, or his poor old overfed horse.\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated who read the average writer’s suggestions on\r\nhorseshoeing, it would appear that there is no other mechanical operation\r\nso difficult as that of attaching a shield of metal to the hoof of a\r\nhorse. That is an erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\nI was once told by an old English shoer that “the man who picked up a\r\nhorse’s foot that had never worn a shoe, gave it a brush or two with\r\na rasp and then nailed on a light piece of iron (an old, half-worn\r\nshoe, perhaps) would do a better job of shoeing than nine-tenths of the\r\nso-called fancy jobs.” I often think of my old English friend, who spent\r\nfive, perhaps seven years, as an apprentice trying to master the trade.\r\nHow different here in free America, and in these catch-as-catch-can\r\ntimes. It is not a rare thing to find men who are proprietors of shoeing\r\nshops, whose apprenticeship consisted of six months or a year’s service\r\nas a helper, and the vast army of horses to be shod is owned and\r\ncontrolled by people who are very much in a hurry, and who give little or\r\nno attention to the care of horses’ feet.\r\n\r\nSo the “family pet,” as Trotwood has called him, goes lame. He is taken\r\nto the shoeing shop in the belief that the shoer can relieve him. Now,\r\nthis shoer is a human being, flesh and blood like other men, and it is\r\nextremely difficult for horseshoers to be strictly honest. (I speak from\r\nexperience.) The fact is, he wants to tell the owner that his horse is\r\ntoo highly fed for the amount of exercise he is getting. He would like to\r\ntell him that high calks and dry stalls are slowly, but surely, drawing\r\nhis hoofs together, causing a lateral pressure of the wall on the more\r\nsensitive internal parts, and he thinks of many other things that point\r\nto the duty of the care-taker. But I have found that, usually, that kind\r\nof talk don’t suit my customers. It puts too much of the responsibility\r\non them, so the shoer begins at once to look wise. The horseshoer who\r\nknows how to look wise is an artist, born to succeed. Placing his thumbs\r\nin the armholes of his vest, he begins a tirade of abuse on the man who\r\nlast shod the horse, after this fashion: “Well, I should think he would\r\nbe lame. Any man that don’t know better than to put a pair of cook stoves\r\nlike those on a horse’s foot,” etc., etc. After he has removed the “cook\r\nstoves” he proceeds to shoe the horse in his own unapproachable way\r\npolishes the shoes, rasps the hoofs carefully and, perhaps, saturates the\r\nbottoms with oil of tar. He pays the price demanded, takes the horse home\r\nand, when his lameness grows worse instead of better, he comes to the\r\nconclusion that he has been “buncoed.”\r\n\r\nA few days ago a grocer’s horse with thick-walled hoofs was brought to\r\nus, shod with heavy shoes and high calks, hoofs badly contracted, and\r\ndead lame. I promised that if given my own way, I would cure him. We\r\nshortened the hoofs, put on a pair of “tips”—just a little patch of\r\niron on each toe, letting the frog, or what remained of it, down on the\r\nground. In less than ten days the lameness ceased though he had been lame\r\nfor many months. In winter when it is necessary to shoe him with calks\r\nagain, he occasionally shows a little lameness, but when spring comes\r\nwe go back to the “tips” and the trouble vanishes. The owner of this\r\nhorse thinks we performed a miracle, but we did nothing of the kind,\r\nwe omitted the fancy rasping, the oil of tar, and the wise look in this\r\ncase, and just kept close to nature.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the old horse cars in the cities I have stood on the\r\nboulder-covered streets of Chicago and watched the car horses, to see how\r\nthey were shod. Imagine my surprise when I found hundreds of them shod in\r\nfront, with shoes similar to those we used on the grocer’s horse.\r\n\r\nWhen we mortals, who flatter ourselves that we are fashioned after\r\nGod’s own image, drift too far from nature’s prescribed course, we soon\r\ndiscover the folly of our actions. If we don’t, the undertaker, for\r\na cash consideration backs up to the front door of our house with a\r\nprofusely tasseled hearse and starts us on our journey toward the head\r\nwaters of Salt river. Meanwhile, the horse goes on, pounding away on the\r\nstony pikes, which, long ago, were substituted for the old bridle paths\r\nand the turf-covered highways, so we resort to metal protection for the\r\nhoof.\r\n\r\nI have always looked upon horseshoeing, as practiced in many shops, as a\r\nnecessary evil, on a par with the taking into the human system of vile\r\nphysics and rank lotions, and when both owner and shoer are equally\r\nignorant or careless, what must the consequences be?\r\n\r\nA number of years ago, a man came to me for advice as to how his family\r\nhorse should be shod. I ventured a suggestion and he brought the horse\r\nin. This was early in September. We shod him all round, doing what we\r\ncalled a first-class job. I advised that the shoes should be reset in\r\nabout six weeks. He went away seemingly much pleased, and his joy lasted\r\nall winter.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of March he came back with the shoes all on just as we left\r\nthem. A few things went through my mind which I thought best not to make\r\nknown to my customer. We reset the shoes and I never saw him afterwards.\r\nThat was about sixteen years ago, and I presume that when the shoes need\r\nresetting again he will bring the horse to have us look after him.\r\n\r\nJust one more: I once shod a banker’s horse all round, early in May. As\r\nhe took the horse from the shop he said his reason for having him shod\r\nwas on account of turning him out to pasture. Shades of Pegasus, think of\r\nthat! During the summer he sold the horse and in November he was brought\r\nto us to be “sharpened up” for the winter. Imagine my surprise when I\r\ndiscovered that not a shoe had been removed since we put them on early in\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nI relate these two instances to show that there are difficulties in the\r\nhandling of horses’ feet over which the shoer has no control, and which\r\nfrequently put him in a frame of mind so that he concludes to abandon the\r\nidea of painstaking, and resolves to be less particular about his work.\r\n\r\nWhile roaming around in this broad, busy country of ours, I have\r\ndrifted into many shoeing shops, and have worked in not a few of them.\r\nThe greatest fault I find with my fellow craftsmen is their universal\r\ntendency toward overdoing. In their zeal to excel the other fellow\r\nthey resort to “fads” and adopt unnecessary methods, many of which are\r\ndecidedly injurious to the horse, and you who have horses to be shod\r\nshould insist that you prefer a plain, careful job, minus the whittling,\r\npolishing, rasping, etc., and the shoer, in these days of close\r\ncompetition, will be only too glad to obey orders.\r\n\r\nBut how shall the owner know what is best for his horse? He is a butcher,\r\na baker or perhaps he is the time-honored “candlestick maker,” and\r\nis as busy as any of us in this mad rush of to-day, from which there\r\nseems to be no escape. So, really, I don’t believe he ever will give\r\nmuch attention to his faithful horse’s feet, and between unscrupulous\r\nhorseshoers and third-grade veterinary surgeons, “poor old Dobbin” will\r\ncontinue to be, as he has been in the past, the victim of his master’s\r\nmisplaced confidence. What does the average man know about the needs and\r\nrequirements of his own body? He has been called “a bundle of habits,”\r\nand from what I can observe, he is about ready to draw a good salary as\r\nthe star performer in “a comedy of errors.” But in spite of stumbling\r\nblocks, and millstones around our necks, out of the rank and file of\r\ncommon men there comes occasionally, an Edison, a Horace Greeley, a\r\nMark Twain or one like your own Major Thomas, whose portrait adorns\r\nthe frontispiece of your March number. From the same source comes an\r\noccasional good, honest, painstaking horseshoer, whose sole ambition is\r\nnot for the dollars he may lay up. He is one whom “goodness and mercy\r\nwill follow, all the days of his life”—one who knows the importance of\r\nhis calling and who realizes that a reputation for sobriety and honesty,\r\ncoupled with natural ability and acquired skill, will bring to him the\r\nreward he is seeking.\r\n\r\nI have written enough for this time, and what have I said in the above\r\npreamble that will enlighten the reader who really is trying to post\r\nhimself on the care of the horse’s foot and the proper method of shoeing\r\nit? He does not desire to become a student of anatomy, and I know from\r\nexperience that the advice of an humble knight of the anvil would not be\r\ntaken seriously by the majority of horse owners.\r\n\r\nBut I have in my library two small volumes on shoeing, and the care\r\nof the hoof, which to me are worth their weight in gold. The first\r\nis “Practical Horseshoeing,” by T. Fleming, President of the Central\r\nVeterinary Surgeons’ Medical Society, Edinburgh, Scotland, published by\r\nD. Appleton Co., New York. No honest man, who knows whereof he speaks,\r\ncan even criticise this work.\r\n\r\nThe other is “Pathological Horseshoeing,” by Joseph B. Coleman, V. S.,\r\nwhich goes a little farther into diseases of the foot and their treatment.\r\n\r\nGet these two little books, brother horse owner, and when the good horse\r\ngoes lame, bump your head against the side of his stall and think. They\r\nwill help you to see how far you are keeping from nature’s ways. Consider\r\nthat your horse is made of tissue and nerves, almost as delicate as your\r\nown; that he is entirely at your mercy and unlike the “Devil Wagon,” he\r\ncannot be patched up with files, monkey-wrenches and cement.\r\n\r\n                                                                LA FORGE.\r\n\r\nPecatonica, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY\r\n\r\n                     Devoted to Farm, Horse and Home.\r\n\r\n                TROTWOOD PUBLISHING CO., Nashville, Tenn.\r\n                     Office 150 Fourth Ave., North.\r\n\r\n                          JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE,\r\n                            Editor-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n                E.

J. Moore, of Moore’s, S. C., writes: “Have you your family\r\ngenealogy? You seem to be up on horse pedigree. I’d like to have it, if\r\nnot too much trouble.”\r\n\r\nAlas and alack! but that is the trouble with most of us. We pedigree our\r\nhorses and dogs, but we throw off terribly on our sons and daughters. Any\r\nold pedigree seems good enough for them. In the language of the Bible,\r\n“Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?” What a Book it is!\r\n“For I, the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of\r\nthe fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of\r\nthem that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me\r\nand keep my commandments.” There is authority for a pedigreed man. And\r\nthe Book itself—chapters are given to the pedigree of one man. The Bible\r\nloves a good pedigree. It is a great registration Book of the Jews. Did\r\nyou ever see Moses’ pedigree tabulated—Moses, the greatest man in the\r\nBible except One? It tells a wonderful story. He was the most inbred man\r\nthat ever lived. And so was the mother of the Christ. These things will\r\ndo to study and think about.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am constrained to say that the quiet study of the pedigree\r\nof horses has taught me much. I have picked up a few of the great lessons\r\nof cause and effect in studying the lower animal that should apply to\r\nthe higher one. That is the only way. Darwin reached the laws of his\r\nevolution by beginning with the lowest form of life.\r\n\r\nI hold it to be a crime for any human being to bring into the world an\r\noffspring which he knows will be inferior to himself. He owes it to\r\nposterity to breed up. The mother is what breeds up. The white man who\r\nbrands his unborn child a mongrel deserves death at the hands of the\r\nrest of his race. Death, because, like the murderer, he is pulling down\r\nsociety. The murderer takes what he cannot restore. But this man does\r\nworse—he chains his own child for life to a dead body.\r\n\r\nIt is a crime because it is the duty of all to breed up—to produce\r\nsomething by well chosen marriage better than themselves. It should be\r\na criminal offense—as it already is a moral one—to bring into the world\r\npeoples with maimed heads, maimed souls and yellow bodies. The Greeks\r\nwere right—it is only through a pure breed that man may reach the stars.\r\nThe Bible is right—it always is: pedigree counts most.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity all the world does not go into the horse business and study\r\nthe effects of heredity long enough to learn a little common sense about\r\nthe breeding of that highest of animals—man! What a pity they cannot get\r\noff their little bicycles long enough to get the hump out of their backs\r\nand the wheels out of their heads, and learn that like, in man or horse,\r\npoet or donkey, produces like or the likeness of an ancestor! Will\r\npeople never learn that falling in love is often nothing in the world but\r\nan accident, and often more fatal than falling down an elevator shaft?\r\nWill they never stop to think that they haven’t any more right to afflict\r\ntheir unborn children with the crotches, cranks, whims, crookedness and\r\nconceit of their own souls than they have to murder them after they are\r\nborn? Ye gods, and is it from this that immortality is made?\r\n\r\nSome day, for the benefit of humanity, I propose to open a Registration\r\nBook. I want to do this because I want to see people take as much\r\ninterest in their own children as they do in their horses, and as much\r\ninterest in their own pedigree as they do in their dog’s. Many a man\r\n“falls in love” with, and marries, a woman whose qualities, character and\r\npedigree, if wrapped up in a horse’s hide, he wouldn’t be caught trading\r\nan old blind mule for; and many a woman, under the same silly pressure,\r\nmarries some vicious brute “to reform him,” who if turned into a buggy\r\nhorse, with half the meanness that he had inherited, she wouldn’t risk\r\nher poodle dog behind.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the way I would go to registering my people. In all\r\nregistration there must first be a foundation stock. I would let\r\ntruthfulness, honesty and work count as “foundation stock.” This would\r\nchange the present standard radically, and let into life a foundation of\r\ngood blood that at present is entirely neglected and not allowed to come\r\nin at all unless it happens to come in under a dress suit. I would then\r\nlet accomplishments—the ability to do—from the ability to do poetry to\r\nthe ability to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before—count\r\nas my classes, and it wouldn’t take me long to straighten out old\r\nhumanity and proceed to breed a race of people fit to live.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n                       Trotwood’s Human Standard.\r\n\r\n    When white men and women meet the following requirements and\r\n    are duly registered, they shall be accepted as standard bred\r\n    and shall be permitted to marry:\r\n\r\n    1. Any white man who has earned and saved one thousand dollars,\r\n    provided he is honest, industrious and truthful, and is sound\r\n    in wind, limb, and mind.\r\n\r\n    2. Any white woman who can cook a square meal, make her\r\n    own clothes, keep a house clean and play on some musical\r\n    instrument, provided always that she is pure, lives under some\r\n    moral standard and will agree to raise her children under it.\r\n\r\n    3. Every man who is the father of a great man or woman.\r\n\r\n    4. Every woman who is the mother of a great man or woman.\r\n\r\n    5. Geniuses, however cranky.\r\n\r\n    6. The father and mother of a genius.\r\n\r\n                             Non-Standard.\r\n\r\n    The following shall be non-standard, and neither they nor their\r\n    children shall be registered:\r\n\r\n    1. Old bachelors from choice.\r\n\r\n    2. Cranks.\r\n\r\n    3. Liars.\r\n\r\n    4. The impure.\r\n\r\n    5. Diseased persons and the children of consumptives, the\r\n    cancerous and the insane.\r\n\r\n    6. The children of impure married women.\r\n\r\n    7. Society people wherever found and their one child.\r\n\r\n    8. Married men who lead germans.\r\n\r\n    9. Women who eat onions, drink beer or whiskey, or chew gum.\r\n\r\n    10. The children of women who play cards for money or for\r\n    prizes. They keep up the supply of gamblers.\r\n\r\n    11. Evangelists who preach slang and dirty sermons from the\r\n    pulpit.\r\n\r\n    12. Dialect poets.\r\n\r\n    13. Praying lawyers.\r\n\r\n    14. Bank cashiers who run Sunday-schools.\r\n\r\n    15. Doctors who give much medicine and cut people open.\r\n\r\n    16. The last three ought really to be damned.\r\n\r\n    17. People who have reached middle age and still say: “I\r\n    taken,” “You hadn’t ought to,” “I seen him,” and “It is me.”\r\n\r\n    Given under the hand and seal, stamped and delivered by\r\n\r\n                                                           TROTWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Wash’s Ma.\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nYour writings as they appeared in the Horse Review always appealed to me,\r\nespecially the “Old Wash” stories, and I remember some years ago that\r\nsome one was impertinent enough to ask the age of Old Wash. Of course,\r\nthat fellow wasn’t entitled to an answer, but as I have run across a\r\nclipping of an old negro woman whom I am sure must be old Wash’s mother\r\n(I hope you can verify it), I want him to look her up. The fact that he\r\nfelt young enough to marry (the unlucky thirteenth) it might interest him\r\nto be able to tell his troubles to his ma.\r\n\r\nYour magazine is a welcome monthly visitor, and may it always come up\r\nto the standard you have planned for it is my earnest wish. Here is the\r\nstory:\r\n\r\nBarnum, the great showman, hearing of an old negro woman down in\r\nTennessee who claimed to be 125 years old, called to see her with a view\r\nto securing her for a side show. He found that the old woman was really\r\nvery ancient, and commenced to question to find out just how old she\r\nreally was. He said to her:\r\n\r\n“Auntie, do you remember George Washington?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon I duz, sah; I’se played wid him many a day.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember anything about the Revolutionary War?” asked Barnum.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say I duz,” replied the old lady. “I ’members when de\r\nbullets wuz a flyin’ and a zoonin’ round here laik bumblebees, sah.”\r\n\r\n“What do you remember about the fall of the Roman empire?” said Barnum.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was “stumped” for a moment, but, recovering herself,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“I wuz a mighty leetle gal den’ but I ’members hearin’ de ole folk say\r\ndat dey heerd sumpin’ drap.”\r\n\r\n                                                          E. J. FERGUSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, Pa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Julie Royster, Raleigh, N. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrotwood’s Travels\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE JOURNEYS THROUGH THE SOUTH—FLORENCE ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that the story of the journey to Florence, Ala., should\r\nappear In the same issue with Jackson’s march into the Creek Nation;\r\nfor the story of this pretty little city on the Tennessee, between the\r\nfoothills of the mountains and the cotton plains beyond, is literally\r\nthumb-marked with Old Hickory.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson knew and understood what was good in woman, in man and\r\nin land. In these he never erred. Never in his life did he tie on to\r\na quitter or touch a yellow streak. When he stamped the seal of his\r\nfriendship on a man or woman, or drove the steel of his compass[1] on\r\nland he had decided to buy, they were already registered. And history, a\r\ncentury later, will tell you they were not false.\r\n\r\nWhen a man’s judgment, like his literature, stands the test of a century,\r\nit is good for all time.\r\n\r\nBut before the white man was the Indian, and before the Indian, the Mound\r\nBuilders. The Mound Builders never were known to settle on poor land.\r\nThey found Florence before the Indian, before the white man, before the\r\nhero of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIt is beautiful to speculate about those people. Who they were and what\r\nthey were only their great, silent mound monuments tell, and they are as\r\ndumb as the unreturning past.\r\n\r\nThe mound they built where the great creek meets the Tennessee is a\r\nperfect and splendid specimen of their custom. Scholars say it was\r\nbuilt for religious worship—not to bury their dead within, and it is\r\none of a series in the valley of the Tennessee. What robed, mysterious\r\npriest and peoples once worshiped around it? What censers of eternal fire\r\nburned always on its summit? What white-robed maidens met a sacrificial\r\ndeath on its summit overlooking the river? What warriors thronged around\r\nit, chanting their battle songs and dipping their spear points in the\r\nvictims’ blood?\r\n\r\n    “Forever and forever flows the river,\r\n      Forever and forever rolls the plain—\r\n    Forever shall the pale stars ’round them quiver,\r\n      But never shall their past return again.\r\n    Hyperion dawns but light their frieze in vain,\r\n      And moons peer sadly through the columned way,\r\n    The midday glares on what doth yet remain\r\n      Of faded glory with a mocking play—\r\n      Thus passeth into shadow man’s imperial sway.”\r\n\r\n[1] The following letter addressed to Gen. Dan Smith is preserved in\r\nNashville:\r\n\r\n                                                “October 29th, 1795.\r\n\r\n    “Sir: Captain John Hays and myself wish to have our land\r\n    divided; for which purpose to-morrow is appointed, wish to\r\n    get the favor of you to do the business, as we wish it done\r\n    accurate; therefore hope you will do us the favor to come to\r\n    my house this evening, so that we may take an early start\r\n    to-morrow. Will thank you to bring with you your compass and\r\n    chain. If you cannot come will thank you to favor me with the\r\n    loan of your compass and chain by the bearer. I am, sir with\r\n    the highest esteem, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                          [Signed] “Andrew Jackson.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the first lots in Florence in July, 1818, James Madison\r\n(who but a few years before had been elected President of the young\r\nRepublic, and Andrew Jackson, who in a few years more was destined to be\r\nanother of her Presidents) both bought lots in the new town, then, as\r\nnow, a goodly, fair site in the bend where the Tennessee, hugging the\r\nSouthern hills as if to escape the mouth of the foaming, passionate,\r\ntumultuous shoals, shrinks away, and, like a beautiful woman when she\r\nthrows off her mantle in the ball room, exposes shoulders fair to see.\r\n\r\nThey were fair enough in the wilderness to stop Jackson and Madison.\r\nJackson must have seen the beautiful site for a city on this most\r\nbeautiful and lordly river often. On his first taste of Indian fighting\r\nhe crossed it somewhere near Florence, when pioneer Tennesseans struck\r\nthe Indian marauders who lived at the great Coldwater spring at the\r\npresent site of Tuscumbia, a few miles beyond. Later his troops crossed\r\nit down the old military road he cut out from Nashville to Pensacola,\r\nwhen they marched to New Orleans, to glory or to death. The gap in the\r\nmountainous hills near where the graceful bridge of the Louisville &\r\nNashville crosses the river is still pointed out as the spot where the\r\nheroes of New Orleans pontooned across from the mouth of the creek.\r\nMethinks the old hero never forgot this spot—the great, splendid river,\r\nwooded, hill-crowned, plain-girdled and thunder-foamed with the spray\r\nfrom the long-leaping, shining shoals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rifle pits on hill at Florence used by Confederate\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\nHe was young when he first saw it. He had made no name and no history. He\r\nwas only a common, ordinary, hot-blooded, dare-devil, cussin’, fighting\r\nIrish boy, lank of form, peaked of face and forehead, with piercing blue\r\neyes, a thin, lofty, religious, idealized, hatchety head, bequeued with\r\nbristling, sandy-red hair.\r\n\r\nYou may think I am foolish to call him religious, but be patient. A man\r\nis born religious or not. And if born so, all his wildness and fighting\r\nand bloodshed and profanity will not eliminate it. No man had more of\r\nit than Jackson. He was naturally religious. Whenever the passions and\r\nfightings of his combatitive trend and nature gave him a breathing spell\r\nhe fell back in every deed and act on the Scotch-Irish predestination\r\nof his breeding. Mr. Eaton walked one night into President Jackson’s\r\nbed room. He was preparing to retire. The miniature of the dead Rachel\r\nJackson, which he wore next to his heart, with a silk string around his\r\nneck, underneath his clothes, lay on the table by her open Bible. He was\r\nreading the Bible, with tears in his eyes, and by him he had her picture\r\nto help him interpret it.\r\n\r\nSome may not think this is religion. But it is religion of the deepest\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nFlorence is full of history, and history that counts.\r\n\r\nJohn Coffee, Jackson’s right-hand general at New Orleans, and who\r\nmarried Rachel Jackson’s niece, was one of the founders of the town, a\r\ncorporation known as The Cypress Creek Land Company. The old hero lies\r\nburied in a nearby hill. A gallant man he was, sturdy and true, and\r\nJackson often said that but for him at New Orleans he knew not what he\r\nwould have done. Old Hickory said that, but, rely upon it, he would have\r\ndone something just the same.\r\n\r\nAnother incorporator was Col. James Jackson, whose old colonial home\r\nstill stands at the Forks, the original plantation covering several\r\nthousand acres of as goodly land as ever felt the pressure of a race\r\nhorse. For here it was that many famous race horses lived and bred their\r\nkind. Col. James Jackson imported Glencoe, a horse, to my mind, greater\r\nthan any that Old Hickory or any of the Tennesseeans ever imported. Often\r\nJames Jackson would meet the Tennesseeans in fierce contests of the turf,\r\nin the Tennessee valley or at the old Clover Bottom, and the laurels were\r\nmore often with the Alabamian.\r\n\r\nIn going through the court records, back to the old books in search\r\nof early history of this beautiful town, I find some queer and quaint\r\ndocuments. I did not search closely, but what little I did see convinced\r\nme that James Madison must have come very near going broke on Florence.\r\nPeople who are used to booms in these days of cities, railroads, mines,\r\nspindles, furnaces and a fast-increasing population don’t know what a\r\npioneer boom really was. Here in the heart of a wilderness a roadless\r\nterritory, the land still flecked with the blood of the white and the\r\nred, the nearest town a village on the Cumberland, one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles away, and only a few settlers along the bluffs of the river,\r\nwith savage Indians lurking in the interior—no peoples, no cities, no\r\nindustries—nothing but a yoke of oxen and a wilderness of uncleared land\r\nupon which to base coupons for the future—here was a boom to make one\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThe lots were untouched forests jutting out on an Indian trail to the\r\nriver. And yet the one on which the present bank stands fetched over\r\n$3,000, and the one just below the courthouse and diagonally across\r\nfetched $1,840! Here is faith for you—here is booming that booms. If\r\nsuch men as Jackson and Madison pinned their faith there like that,\r\nin July, 1818, what splendid opportunities now offer themselves for\r\nfaith in a town which, as one stands on the hillside looking down on\r\nthe same great river, sees it covered with a cloud, not from the sky,\r\nbut from earth—from furnace and factory, and behold, the valley of\r\nerstwhile woods, the busy mart of men in homes and houses. And two great\r\nrailroads—the Louisville & Nashville and the Southern—and one great\r\nriver, to keep freight down.\r\n\r\nThe total sale of the first two or three hundred lots was $233,580.\r\nAndrew Jackson bought lot 6 for $350; Nos. 57 to 62, for $250 to $400.\r\nMadison bought lot No. 28 for $300; 39 for $390; 41 to 44, $400 to $600.\r\n\r\nMadison made his first payments, and then—let them all go for taxes!\r\nEvidently the great expounder of the Constitution and President of the\r\nUnited States took his first lesson in boom towns when Fate sent him to\r\nthe Tennessee River to close up an Indian treaty.\r\n\r\nAnd he must have been easy. Oh, if the real estate agents of to-day could\r\nalways meet his kidney!\r\n\r\nFurther tracing of old records shows that he caught it all around.\r\nNovember 1st, 1826, I find that James Madison appointed one Dabney Morris\r\nhis agent to handle “all his lands in Alabama, all lots in Florence,\r\nalso eight shares of stock in Cypress Land Company.” On August 22, 1826,\r\nis an agreement in which James Madison extends the time of payment of a\r\njudgment he held against one Bedford amounting to $4,680.96. And, worst\r\nof all, Dabney Morris laid down on him, for later a record shows that\r\nMorris’ notes to Madison went to protest, to satisfy which the said\r\nMorris turned over land to said Madison to the tune of $24,866—a small\r\nfortune in those days (in money, not in land) when money was worth nearly\r\ndouble what it now is. In the slang language of to-day, they evidently\r\n“did enough to Jimmy.”\r\n\r\nBut Old Hickory paid for his. It is not recorded that he lost a cent. Old\r\nHickory was born holding on. He never turned loose.\r\n\r\nAnd to show what things cost in those days: On October 20, 1819, Thomas\r\nChildress and W. W. Warner, who had been appointed to sell the effects\r\nand settle up the estate of a deceased pioneer, report the sale of\r\nthe following: Twelve negro slaves, $4,200; five head of horses, $225\r\n($45 each—ye gods! Evidently they were not Hals); twenty-three head of\r\ncattle, $165 (that was before the beef trust); twenty-nine head of hogs,\r\n$86.50; five beds and furniture, $100; two spinning wheels, $2; two rifle\r\nguns, $22; ‘one pare saddle bags,’ $1; and five ‘setting chairs,’ $2.50\r\n(‘setting chairs’—this was evidently the beginning of the incubator\r\nidea). Just below it John W. Byrne sells a nineteen-year-old negro to\r\nJames Hickman for $460, whom he guarantees to be “sound, healthy, clear\r\nof any disorder whatever.” And land sales—some of it fetched fifty\r\ndollars per acre. That was before it was cleared, too.\r\n\r\nIt can now be bought for $10 to $25 an acre, and will raise two crops in\r\none year!\r\n\r\nIf there was any faith for their belief nearly a century ago, what a\r\nchance now for the man who invests in Florence or in Lauderdale land!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome months ago I found a rare old book which has afforded me a great\r\ndeal of pleasure as well as information. It is called “Letters from\r\nAlabama,” by Anne Royal, whom it seems was a most eccentric old woman,\r\nafflicted with a mania for writing down everything she saw or heard\r\n(and remarkably well she did it) on a trip by stage and horseback which\r\nshe made for the purpose of seeing the new country. She left Washington\r\nNovember, 1817, and reached Melton’s Bluff, on the Tennessee River, about\r\nNew Year. Her description of men and things in the new country is the\r\nmost interesting I have ever read, and the most accurate. As Melton’s\r\nBluff, as she called the place, is not far from Florence (I think it was\r\nafterwards called Marathon), I will give some of her descriptions of the\r\nnew country as it looked then, six months before Florence was laid out\r\ninto town lots:\r\n\r\n“You have heard that this country consists of table and bottom land, also\r\nof the bluffs. These bluffs happen where there is no bottom land, but the\r\ntableland running up to the river forms a high precipice, called a bluff.\r\nThis is the case at Melton’s Bluff, the highest I have seen. Here is a\r\nvery large plantation of cotton and maize, worked by about sixty slaves,\r\nowned by General Jackson, who bought the interests of old Melton.\r\n\r\n“No language can convey an idea of the beauties of Melton’s Bluff. It is\r\nsaid to be the handsomest spot in the world, off the seaboard, and rich\r\nas it is beautiful. I can sit in my room and see the whole plantation;\r\nthe boats gilding down the river, and the opposite shore, one mile\r\ndistant. The ducks, geese and swan, playing at the same time on the bosom\r\nof the stream, with a full view of the many islands. It is, after all,\r\nthe great height of the site that pleases.\r\n\r\n“I took a walk with some ladies to-day over the plantation, as we wished\r\nto have a nearer view of those snowy fields which so sedulously present\r\nthemselves to our view, together with orchards, gin houses, gardens,\r\nMelton’s mansion, and a considerable negro town.\r\n\r\n“We approached the mansion by a broad street running up the river bank\r\neast of the town. This street seems suspended between heaven and earth,\r\nas the whole premises for two miles, all in sight, appears to be elevated\r\nabove the horizon, and none above the rest. We entered the courtyard,\r\nfronting the house, by a stile; and the first thing we met was a large\r\nscaffold overspread with cotton; as it was in the seed, there must have\r\nbeen many thousand pounds. Being damp from dew, and often rain, it must\r\nbe dried in this manner. The mansion was large, built with logs, shingled\r\nroof, and may have been built twenty-five or thirty years since. I\r\nrecoiled at the sight of a place once the habitation of such a monster\r\nas Melton was. Some of our party went in: I did not. General Jackson’s\r\noverseer, who joined us here, said he lived in the lower story, the\r\nupper being filled with cotton. This scaffold was about four feet from\r\nthe ground. From this we crossed another fence, and found ourselves in a\r\ncotton field of about one hundred acres, white with cotton and alive with\r\nnegroes. The center of this field is said to be the rallying point of\r\nviewing the scenery, as it doubtless is. You can see up to Brown’s Ferry,\r\neight miles distant, with the naked eye, and the same distance down.\r\n\r\n“The term ‘beauty’ is applied to anything which excites pleasant\r\nfeelings. Beauty is said to be a uniformity amidst variety, a proportion\r\nof parts adapted to a whole, fitness of things to an end, quantity and\r\nsimplicity. All this is realized on Melton’s Bluff. Here is a noble river\r\nwhich combines in itself all you can conceive of grandeur and utility,\r\nadorned with islands, spangled with boats, and enlivened with wild\r\nflowers. Lift your eye from the river, and lo! magnificent fields, white\r\nas snow, orchards, farms and houses all in view, without moving out of\r\nthe spot. You may thus form some idea of this far-famed bluff. Here the\r\ngreen islands look like floating meadows. Here the boatman wields his\r\nmossy oar and guides his freighted boat along. Here the wild fowl arrayed\r\nin glossy plumes, wantons as she lists. Here the distant billows breaking\r\no’er the shoals, echo back in murmuring sounds, and mingling sweetly\r\nwith the music of the boatman’s viol, swells upon the ear and softly\r\ndies away upon the breeze. To crown the whole, here the majestic swan,\r\nrobed in dazzling white, moves in all her graceful attitudes. These are\r\nbeauties which may be felt but cannot be described. This combination of\r\nobjects, each beautiful in itself, and so materially useful, constitutes\r\nthe beauty of Melton’s Bluff. All the trade of East Tennessee pass by the\r\nBluff and halt there to take in their pilots.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Indian Mound on the banks of the Tennessee River, at\r\nFlorence, Ala.]\r\n\r\nCan description be more beautiful? Anne Royal, whoever she was, could\r\nwrite classic English for her day and generation.\r\n\r\nFrom Huntsville, December 25, 1817, she wrote: “The face of this country\r\nhas changed five times in my tour. From Big Sandy river (the boundary\r\nof Kentucky and Virginia) to Mount Sterling, the soil is black, firm,\r\nuneven and covered with heavy timber, beech and oak principally. From Mt.\r\nSterling to Danville, called first-rate land, it is generally black as\r\nyour hat and the growth is locust, cherry and walnut. They continue to\r\nthe Red river, in Tennessee, one hundred miles. They are not a dead or\r\nprairie-like level, but rather waving.\r\n\r\n“Next to them comes on the lofty timbered black, rich soil and large\r\ngrape vines and continues to Nashville. Upon leaving Nashville the\r\nred cedar begins and though the land is still rich, it is much\r\ninterrupted with swamps and stones. This is well watered and continues\r\nto Fayetteville, on Elk River, near the southern boundary of the State.\r\nThere again we have the black loam and heavy timber, till within eighteen\r\nmiles of Huntsville, when the chocolate lands commence again, like the\r\nbarrens; though light, it is not destitute of timber. All of these lands\r\nextend from the mountains on the left, to the Ohio on the right. We\r\nforded all the rivers in Kentucky and Tennessee except Kentucky river.\r\nThe Kentuckians are the handsomest people, by far, in the United States.\r\nThey are not very stout men, but have fine features and very beautiful\r\ncomplexions. The Tennesseans are not so stout as the Kentuckians, nor\r\nso fair, but they are well shaped and more active. There is a native,\r\nbold independence in both, with this difference: the Kentuckians are\r\ngreat brags, whilst the Tennesseans, equally as brave and gallant, are\r\nwholly unconscious of their virtues. What astonished me most was their\r\ncareless indifference on the subject of their late gallant achievement,\r\nparticularly at New Orleans. They spoke of it with perfect unconcern, and\r\nonly mentioned it when applied to, and then not half the same interest\r\nthey would show on the subject of hunting and killing deer. Not so the\r\nKentuckians—they appreciate their bravery to the greatest extent. The\r\nKentucky ladies are very large, but are fair and well featured, and\r\nmuch more polished (excepting the ladies of Nashville) than the ladies\r\nof Tennessee; but the latter are better shaped, are very artless and\r\nthe young women have a sweet simplicity in their looks and countenance.\r\nBoth men and women are without disguise, nor have they any of that\r\nimpertinent curiosity common to other States. But the most distinguishing\r\ntrait of the Tennessean is that he treats all men alike. The nabob, with\r\nhis splendid equipage, receives no more nor as much attention as the\r\npedestrian. They are extremely jealous of wealthy, or what we call big,\r\nmen. One of them, as I came on, being asked rather peremptorily by one of\r\nthe big bugs, to rub down his horse, cursed him and told him to ‘Do it\r\nyourself—I am no man’s servant.’\r\n\r\n“Last evening I had the pleasure of seeing General Coffee, the renowned\r\nsoldier and companion of General Jackson. This hero, of whom you have\r\nheard so much, is upward of six feet in height, and proportionately wide.\r\nNor did I ever see so fine a figure. He is thirty-five or thirty-six\r\nyears of age, his face is full, and features handsome. His complexion\r\nis ruddy, though sunburned. His hair and eyes black and a soft serenity\r\ndiffuses his countenance. His hair is carelessly thrown to one side\r\nand displays one of the finest foreheads in nature—high, smooth and\r\nretreating. His countenance has much animation while speaking and his\r\neye sparkles. I expected to see a stern, haughty, fierce warrior. No\r\nsuch thing. You look in vain for the Indian fighter. He is as cool as a\r\ndewdrop, but deep in his soul you see very plain that desperate, firm,\r\ncool and manly courage which has covered him with glory. He must be a\r\nhost when he is aroused. He speaks very slowly and may weigh about 200\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\nFrom Milton’s Bluff (which she says was afterward changed to Marathon),\r\nJanuary 18, 1818, she writes: “Good news awaits you. Read on. Having\r\ncollected a few books in a corner I heard some one say: ‘General Jackson,\r\nGeneral Jackson comes,’ and running to my window I saw him walking slowly\r\nup the hill between two gentlemen, his aids. He was dressed in a blue\r\nfrock coat, with epaulettes, a common hat, with a black cockade and a\r\nsword by his side. He is very tall and slender. He walked on by our door\r\nto Major Wyatt’s, his companion in arms, where he put up for the night,\r\nthough he called on us that evening and the next morning. His person is\r\nfinely shaped and his features not handsome, but strikingly bold and\r\ndetermined. He is very easy and affable in his manners, and loves a jest.\r\nHe told one of our party he ‘was one of the blue hen’s chickens.’ He\r\nappears to be about fifty years old. There is a great deal of dignity\r\nabout him. He related many hardships endured by his men in the army, but\r\nnever a word of his own. His language is pure and fluent, and he has\r\nthe appearance of having kept the best company. He has been ordered by\r\nthe government against the Seminole Indians. His army is on the march\r\nconsiderably ahead of him, having crossed at Ditto’s Landing, up the\r\nriver, but he came round by this place, to see his plantation and slaves.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd what of those lands to-day, and what are the inducements they offer\r\nto the Northern farmer seeking a home in the South? Meeting a very\r\nintelligent and reliable farmer, Mr. W. M. Sammon, who had moved from\r\nDalton, Ill., to Lauderdale country, near Florence, some seven years\r\nago, I interviewed him on this subject, reminding him that Trotwood’s\r\nwas a medium which would rather under-estimate than over-color the\r\npicture; that a people did not take much stock in highly-colored pictures\r\nof glorious Edens, finding them to be untrue and as such hurting all\r\nconcerned. “That is true,” said Mr. Sammon, “and well said. Many hundreds\r\nof Northern people are misled by such statements and become disgusted\r\nwhen the real facts are enough to captivate any one wishing to make a\r\nhome here. To begin with, I sold my land in Illinois at three times what\r\njust as good, if not better, land cost me here, with three more months in\r\nthe year for working it. I found the land just as level as in Illinois,\r\nand hence I could use the same tools I had there for corn, wheat, oats\r\nand alfalfa. I find red clover grows here just as well as in Illinois,\r\nand other grasses we cannot grow there, such, for instance, as Bermuda,\r\nwhich will grow anywhere here and make the finest summer pasture in the\r\nworld, standing sun and drought when other grasses would die. The land\r\ndoes not produce as much corn per acre as does Illinois. Corn in the\r\nSouth, owing to the longer climate, goes much to stalk and fewer stalks\r\ncan be planted in the hill, but mine produces from twenty-five to forty\r\nbushels on the upland and as high as sixty in richer lowlands. But this\r\nis to a great extent offset by the difference in price, selling here\r\nall the time at sixty to seventy cents, whereas in the North we do well\r\nto get forty cents per bushel. All kinds of live stock I find do better\r\nhere, for they are not troubled with flies, and hence we have no nets to\r\nplough under, nor screens for the house. One of the greatest problems\r\nto the farmer in Illinois is help. Last fall a friend of mine came here\r\nand told me he had to help his wife wash the clothes every week. I paid\r\n$25 and board for my farm help up there, but here I get good help at\r\n$8 to $10 and board. As for water, there is no comparison. Up there it\r\nwas ponds and cisterns, but here is a country of springs. I never saw\r\nanything like it. Creeks, too, with beds full of gravel, which make the\r\nfinest roads in the world. It is the best watered and healthiest country\r\nI ever saw. The water here is plentiful and easy of access.\r\n\r\n“The greatest crop I have found here to build up the land is peas—the\r\nSouthern pea. It is equal to clover as a nitrogen producing crop,\r\nenriching the land, and as a money-maker it beats anything in the North.\r\nI sow peas in my corn every third row and run round it a few times. It is\r\nlaid by with the corn. I can make ten dollars worth of pork per acre in\r\npeas and leave the land better than it was. I can raise all stock cheaper\r\nhere, even turkeys, on account of the peas and grasshoppers. There are\r\nnine months of pasture, year in and year out. The land is not as rich as\r\nin Illinois, but I make more, owing to peas. My clover there, I could\r\nhardly give away, it selling at $2 to $4 per ton, but here I find ready\r\nsale for my pea hay at $12 to $15 per ton, and raise more per acre than\r\nclover. Wheat needs some fertilizers here, as the belt is far south, but\r\nit produces fairly well. I find good money in raising mules. Pastures are\r\nso cheap that they practically cost nothing. I buy western mares, good\r\nworkers, very cheap, and raise a mule worth $150 that is not housed at\r\nall and runs in the pasture or on cane all the year.\r\n\r\n“The climate is mild and pleasant. People have a mistaken idea as to\r\nthe heat. It is not as hot here as there, for the heat is steady, even\r\ntemperature, and a good breeze in the summer.\r\n\r\n“I think I know when I have a good thing, and I am sorry I have not lived\r\nhere all my life. I have made more money and enjoyed better health, and\r\nthe people are kind, neighborly and hospitable. They are not after the\r\ndollar alone.”\r\n\r\nThis is the talk of a straightforward, practical farmer, who knows what\r\nhe is talking about, and what he says the reader of Trotwood’s may rely\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence is at the head of the famous Mussel Shoals, the opening of which\r\nhas cost Uncle Sam the sum of seven million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Where Hood’s army crossed the Tennessee River at Florence,\r\nAla., November, 1864.]\r\n\r\nUncle Sam never does anything on a small scale, and here, at\r\nheadquarters, on the banks of the clear, silver river, where seven\r\nmillions of dollars have been appropriated to unlock 660 miles of\r\nnavigable water and 1,000 miles of tributary streams, all of which had\r\nbeen locked in the beginning of things and its key hidden to all save\r\nthe unconquerable spirit of American enterprise, here everything was in\r\nkeeping with the magnitude of the undertaking and the build and mold of\r\nthings. It is a paradise in the woods, an Arcadia in primeval forests.\r\nIt is strength and beauty—a touch of modern art on a background of\r\nthe antique, a background of rock and beetling cliff, in a setting of\r\nsternest and ruggedest realism. Modern houses for offices on the brow\r\nof a rock, whose crinkled lips smile a grim and perpetual smile, as if\r\nenjoying the joke that a few thousand years will make in the change\r\nof man’s baubles above it. Handsome government buildings on a level\r\nplateau, surrounded with silence and eternal hills, which half-mockingly\r\nlook down, as if to say, “Did we not see it ten thousand years ago,\r\nwhen another civilization did the same?” Steel aqueducts, leading\r\ncaptive waters across Shoal creek—a tube of steel binding the waist\r\nof this barbarian of the woods, that civilization might walk over his\r\nbreast—water flowing across water, and that below grumbling with spiteful\r\nwhirl and jealousy at the usurpation above. A rare picture of the present\r\nand the past, of strength and weakness, of beauty and grandeur, but\r\nabove all the never-changing setting of eternal hills, and through it all\r\nthe sigh of perpetual silence unbroken by this ripple of living laughter\r\nwhich scarcely touches the skirts of its dream.\r\n\r\nNo prettier ride than that on the little government railroad which runs\r\nfor fourteen miles on the edge of the canals and locks, and between it\r\nand the river. Now it shoots through classic-looking caves, in somber\r\nwoods, that brings to one’s mind Keats’ Temple of Latona:\r\n\r\n    Beyond the matron temple of Latona\r\n      Which we should see but for these darkening boughs\r\n      Lies a deep hollow from whose ragged brows\r\n    Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart.\r\n\r\nNow it whirls around a great, lofty cliff, around whose neck the red\r\nberries cling like beads on savage shoulders, and then into valleys where\r\nthe skies seem to stoop down to kiss the river.\r\n\r\nIt is a poem to look at all this—a never-forgotten poem—a poem, and an\r\nopera to live and act it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrolling through the grounds which Uncle Sam has made to look like\r\na paradise in the wilderness, I ran upon a unique character in Uncle\r\nReuben Paterson, one of your old-time darkies. Uncle Rube is a character\r\nin his way. A giant in stature, except a lameness which has made him\r\nalways prefer riding to walking. Hence this yarn. He is one of the few\r\ndarkies you meet who is really humorous. Many people think all darkies\r\nare more or less funny, and while they are, it is rarely you find one\r\nwho appreciates the humorous, from an intellect capable of seeing it.\r\nIt took me some time to draw Uncle Rube out—he is a darky of more than\r\nusual intelligence—but when he found I was fond of horses he gave this\r\nexperience of his in the Civil War:\r\n\r\n“You see, boss, I wuz body servant for Colonel Josiah Patterson, endu’in’\r\nde wah, an’ I got inter some purty close places. Bein’ crippled, I seldom\r\ncould walk much, so I was mighty nigh raised on a hoss.

Yer knows whut dat means, don’t yer?’\r\n\r\n“‘Boss,’ sez I, ‘dat’ll jes fetch on mo’ talkin’ an’ sputin, so I’ll do\r\nde bes’ I kin ter drive er team.’\r\n\r\n“I noticed de colonel wuz mounted on be finest black hoss I hed eber\r\nseen, an’ ez dey hed treated me so bad, I concluded den an’ dar I’d\r\nswap fer ’im. Dat night dey tuck me to haidquarters an’ made me sleep\r\njes’ outside de colonel’s tent. I’d seed whar dey hed tethered de hoss\r\ndown by de fence, so ’bout ’leben o’clock, I laid out by de tent, jes\r\noutside, and made lak I’d gone ter sleep. When all wuz quiet, I run my\r\nhan’ under de tent an’ pulled ez easy ez I cud, twell I pulled out de\r\ncolonel’s bridle. Den I pulled er little at er time twell I got de saddle\r\nand holsters, pistols an’ all. I slipped ’em off, put ’em on dat hoss,\r\nstruck up de crick so ez ter keep frum bringin’ on enny furder talk wid\r\nde pickets, an’ I rid dat hoss inter camp, twenty odd miles away, in jes\r\ntwo hours. O, he wuz er dandy, saddle an’ all.

In\r\nour marchin’ one day I seed a mighty fine mud-lark ober in a farmer’s\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n“What’s a mud-lark,” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Wal, a mud-lark in wah times,” said Uncle Rube, “is a fatt’nin’ shote,\r\nan’ I wanted dis one, but I wanted to tote fair wid Torm, an’ dat\r\nebenin’ I ’proached ’im on de subjec’ uv gwine in partnership wid me an’\r\ndervidin dat hawg up ’twixt our messes.

Somepin’ in Torm’s talk made me know he wuz gwine at dat\r\nberry hawg, so dat night I hid out in de bushes whar he hed ter pass, an’\r\nsho nuff, ’bout midnight heah he come wid dat mud-lark on his back, all\r\ndone scraped an’ cleaned fer de mess. When he got close ernuff I riz up\r\nan’ sez:\r\n\r\n“‘Halt! Who goes dar?’\r\n\r\n“I seed he thort he’d run inter er Yankee picket, an’ I pulled my\r\ngun—bang! bang! bang!

Here, where once were woods, is a growing city, its\r\nmanufactories covering the banks of a noble stream, which, with the\r\ntwo greatest railroads in the South—the Louisville & Nashville and the\r\nSouthern—give it rates and an opportunity unsurpassed anywhere. It is\r\nas sure to be a great city as men are to see and hear. Here is the\r\nopportunity of a life for any young man who wishes to till the land or to\r\nbuild factories or stores.\r\n\r\nBut this part of it is all better told by Mr. Sweetland in another\r\nchapter herein, and I desist.—Ed. Trotwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence As It Was in 1820.\r\n\r\nBy ANNE ROYAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (The following account of Florence, written two years after the\r\n    town was laid off, will be interesting to all.—Ed.)\r\n\r\nFlorence is one of the new towns of this beautiful and rapid rising\r\nState. It is happily situated for commerce at the head of steamboat\r\nnavigation, on the north side of the Tennessee River, in the county of\r\nLauderdale, five miles below the port of the Mussel Shoals, and ten miles\r\nfrom the line of the State of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nFlorence is to be the great emporium of the northern part of this State.\r\nI do not see why it should not; it has a great capital and is patronized\r\nby the wealthiest gentlemen in the State. It has a great State at its\r\nback; another in front, and a noble river on all sides, the steamboats\r\npouring every necessary and every luxury into its lap. Its citizens,\r\nbold, enterprising, and industrious—much more so than any I have seen in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nMany large and elegant brick buildings are already built here, (although\r\nit was sold out, but two years since), and frame houses are putting up\r\ndaily. It is not uncommon to see a framed building begun in the morning\r\nand finished by night.\r\n\r\nSeveral respectable mercantile houses are established here, and much\r\nbusiness is done on commission also. The site of the town is beautifully\r\nsituated on an eminence, commanding an extensive view of the surrounding\r\ncountry and Tennessee River, from which it is three-quarters of a mile\r\ndistant. It has two springs of excellent and never failing water.\r\nFlorence has communication by water with Mississippi, Missouri,\r\nLouisiana, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, West Pennsylvania, West\r\nVirginia and East Tennessee, and very shortly will communicate with\r\nthe Eastern States, through the great canal. The great military road\r\nthat leads from Nashville to New Orleans, by way of Lake Ponchartrain,\r\npasses through this town, a number of people who travel through it, and\r\nthe numerous droves of horses from the lower country, for market, are\r\nincredible. Florence contains one printing press, and publishes a paper\r\nweekly called the Florence Gazette; it is ably patronized, and edited\r\nby one of our first men, and said to be the best paper in the State.\r\nFlorence is inhabited by people from almost all parts of Europe and the\r\nUnited States; here are English, Irish, Welsh, Scotch, French, Dutch,\r\nGermans and Grecians. The first Greek I ever saw was in this town. I\r\nconversed with him on the subject of his country, but found him grossly\r\nignorant. He butchers for the town, and has taken to his arms a mullatto\r\nwoman for a wife. He very often takes an airing on horseback of a Sunday\r\nafternoon, with his wife, riding by his side, and both arrayed in shining\r\ncostumes.\r\n\r\nThe river at Florence is upwards of five hundred yards wide; it is\r\nferried in a large boat worked by four horses, and crosses in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThere are two large and well kept taverns in Florence, and several\r\ndoggeries. A doggery is a place where spiritous liquors are sold; and\r\nwhere men get drunk, quarrel and fight, as often as they choose, but\r\nwhere there is nothing to eat for man or beast. Did you ever hear\r\nanything better named. “I swear!” said a Yankee pedler, one day, with\r\nboth his eyes bunged up, “that are doggery be rightly named. Never seed\r\nthe like on’t. If I get to hum agin it’l be a nice man’l catch me in\r\nthese here parts. Awfullest place one could be at.” It appeared the\r\ninmates of the doggery enticed him under pretense of buying his wares,\r\nand forced him to drink; and then forced him to fight; but the poor\r\nlittle Yankee was sadly beaten. Not content with blackening his eyes,\r\nthey overturned his tin cart, and scattered his tins to the forewinds,\r\nfrightened his horse and tormented his very soul out about lasses, etc.\r\nHe was a laughable object, but to hear his dialect in laying off the law,\r\nwas a complete farce, particularly when Pat came to invite him into the\r\nsame doggery to drink friends: “I ben’t a dog to go into that are dog\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe people, you see, know a thing or two, here; they call things by their\r\nright names. But to proceed. There may be about one hundred dwelling\r\nhouses and stores, a court house, and several warehouses in Florence.\r\nThe latter are, however, on the river. One of the longest buildings I\r\never saw is in Florence. It was built by a company of gentlemen, and is\r\nsaid to have cost ninety thousand dollars, and is not yet finished. The\r\nproprietors, being of this place, are men of immense wealth, and are\r\npushing their capital with great foresight and activity. For industry and\r\nactivity, Florence outstrips all the northern towns in the State. More\r\npeople travel this road than all our western roads put together. I was\r\njust going to conclude, when an old German passing through my room, from\r\nthat of my landlady’s, made me laugh, in reply to something uttered by\r\nthe lady, he said: “Poverty was no crime, when came honestly by it.”\r\n\r\nMore of Florence. I observed in my last, the surprising wealth of this\r\nplace. The principal gentlemen of wealth are General Coffee, James\r\nJackson, Esq., Major McKinley (now a Senator in Congress from Alabama),\r\nand Messrs. Simpson and Gaither. Of these J. Jackson is said to be not\r\nonly wealthy, but the wealthiest man in the State. There are, however,\r\nmany others quite easy in their circumstances. General Coffee, and J.\r\nJackson live out of town. Major McKinley lives in Florence, and is\r\nreputed to be the first lawyer in the three States. He is a stout, fine\r\nlooking man; of easy manners, as all gentlemen are; and his dwelling\r\ncontains more taste and splendor, by one-half, than I ever saw in my\r\nwhole life put together. But this is nothing. Mrs. McKinley, the elegance\r\nof her manners, and the sweetness of her conversation, joined with her\r\ninteresting children, completely disconcerted me. Everything in the\r\nhouse had, to me, the appearance of enchantment. I never was in such a\r\nparadise before. Mrs. McKinley looked as though she had dropped from\r\nabove. I never was more confounded. And the children. They are truly a\r\npattern. The dear little things were in the nursery, and hearing there\r\nwas a stranger in the parlor, prevailed on the nurse to open the door, a\r\nfew inches, that they might see who was there, but they were instantly\r\nupbraided by their mother. Make these a pattern for your children, if\r\nyou should have any. I begged admission for the dear creatures, and they\r\nwere admitted upon condition of good behavior. They were the handsomest\r\nchildren I ever beheld, and I was so completely fascinated by their\r\nmanners, I forget every thing else. Mrs. McKinley informed me she was\r\nfrom Philadelphia, and was acquainted with Mrs. Dr. Charles Lewis.\r\n\r\nAll the ladies of Florence excel in the domestic virtues. No gadding\r\nabroad. They demean themselves with that modesty and attention to their\r\ndomestic affairs, beyond any ladies I have seen in the State. Mrs. Coffee\r\n(a niece of Mrs. General Jackson), comes to preaching in a plain bonnet\r\nand calico dress. General Coffee was here since I arrived, and appears to\r\nbe much reduced since I saw him in Huntsville. His constitution was much\r\ninjured by the hardships he suffered in the army. I was never in speaking\r\nof James Jackson. It is said he is a native of Ireland. Mrs. Ward, Mrs.\r\nGibson and Mrs. Southworth, the printer’s wife, and several others, are\r\ncharming women. Captain Gibson, a son of the brave Colonel Gibson, of\r\nTennessee, is one of the most amiable men on earth.\r\n\r\nIt is unaccountable why such a number of physicians should flock into\r\nthis country. Every town is flooded with them. They are strung along the\r\nroads like so many blacksmith’s shops. You can either walk or ride, but\r\nyou have a physician on each side, one in front, and one in rear. Here\r\nare seven in Florence, seven more went away for want of room. There are\r\nalso here, six lawyers. I left thirteen doctors in Courtland, a much\r\nsmaller place. One hundred passed through the latter, south, unable to\r\nget in. You cannot, as I stated before, travel a mile on any great road,\r\nwithout meeting with a doctor’s shop. But this is not all. Almost every\r\npractising doctor has three or four students. I have known mechanics quit\r\ntheir trade and commence the study of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence, Alabama\r\n\r\nTHE COMING CITY OF THE SOUTH]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing the story of Florence, it is our intention to do it in a\r\ndifferent way from the usual method of writing such stories. Trotwood’s\r\nMonthly is known as the magazine that is “Different” and we want to be\r\nthat way. The fact that “John Smith came here in 1869, commenced farming\r\nunder innumerable disadvantages, was married on February 5, 1874 to\r\nMiss Mary Jones, and that the union was blessed with several children,\r\nand that his sterling worth as a citizen and business man, is highly\r\nappreciated, etc., etc.,” may be gratifying to the vanity of John Smith,\r\nbut does it help Florence? We think not, and will, therefore, write the\r\nstory in a “Different” way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Lauderdale County Courthouse, 1822-1900.]\r\n\r\nThe history of Florence from the day of the Moundbuilders has been told\r\nin this issue by Mr. John Trotwood Moore, in his “Southern Travels.” It\r\nis our intention only to tell of the commercial advantages, and tell it\r\nwithout any “hot air” attachments. Probably the most interesting story\r\nto be told in connection with Florence at the present time is the story\r\nof Mussel Shoals, for what it means to Florence, no one at this time can\r\ntell. If it is true that the waste waters of the great canal are to be\r\nharnessed, and electricity transmitted to the surrounding territory, it\r\nsimply means that “Greater Florence” will be the leading city of Alabama,\r\nand one of the leading cities of the entire South. The story of Mussel\r\nShoals has been written, and appears in this number, and the main stem\r\nof the story is facts. We prefer to allow our readers to form their own\r\nconclusions as to the result, but it is easy enough to see that it will\r\nmean the present Florence will give way to the Greater Florence, and\r\nrank with the best Southern cities. We would not be dealing in facts if\r\nwe tried to convey the idea that Florence alone is to be benefitted by\r\nthis contemplated improvement, for it means that the surrounding country\r\nand the neighboring town and cities will also reap their share of the\r\nprosperity incidental to this improvement.\r\n\r\nFlorence is an ideal place for a home. It is much easier to tell what\r\nthey have not got, than to tell of the many advantages. There is an\r\nabundance of pure water, an ideal climate, good schools, good society, an\r\nabundance of the most beautiful scenery to be found anywhere and if there\r\nis any disadvantages around Florence from the standpoint of its being\r\na desirable place to live, we failed to discover it. The price of real\r\nestate in Florence, as compared with values quoted elsewhere, is below\r\nthe average. A more desirable home can be bought in Florence for the\r\nmoney than can be bought most any place else in the South. Florence has\r\nmore modern homes that are up-to-date in architecture than many places\r\ntwice the size. Every street shows the progressiveness of the citizens in\r\nbuilding homes that are a credit to Florence and to Northern Alabama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lauderdale County Courthouse, Florence, Ala.]\r\n\r\nTwo live newspapers cover the local field thoroughly, and they are not\r\nspending any time slinging muddy editorials at each other, but are\r\ninterested in the development of Florence, and both are a credit to the\r\ncity. Their equipment is superior to that found in many offices twice the\r\nsize, and their columns are bright and full of the latest news.\r\n\r\nWhen a manufacturer investigates with a view to locating, he invariably\r\nasks: “What are the banking facilities?” Florence can well be proud of\r\nher banks, and a glance at their advertisements herein will tell the\r\nstory. The First National has stood the test of time, and the Alabama\r\nTrust and Savings Bank show by their deposits that they have the entire\r\nconfidence of the people, for they are but a few months old. These banks\r\nare safe and reliable, conservative and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nFlorence is noted for her educational institutions, and with the best\r\ngraded schools and colleges can offer more in the way of educational\r\nfeatures than many cities of larger size.\r\n\r\nFlorence has transportation advantages that place her in a commanding\r\nposition, and with competition from two railroads and the Tennessee\r\nRiver, and with other railroads under consideration, is placed in close\r\ntouch with the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no city in the United States that enjoys better\r\nadvantages than Florence as a manufacturing point. Competing railroads\r\nand river transportation, cheap fuel, cheap labor, right at the door of\r\none of the biggest furnaces in the South, they are able to get the best\r\ngrade of iron at a very low cost, and without the usual transportation\r\ncharges added.\r\n\r\nLumber in abundance, and right at the door of the best coal mines in\r\nthe South. Cheap power is one of the essential features of a successful\r\nmanufacturing point, and even with the present conditions to say nothing\r\nof the Mussel Shoals improvement, it places Florence ahead of most any\r\ncity in the South as a manufacturing center.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the advantages of locating a manufacturing plant in\r\nFlorence we will cite the case of the Stove Foundry. They are at the\r\nvery door of the Philadelphia Furnace, and have in many cases had\r\ndeliveries of iron on two hours’ notice—sometimes less. Now comes the\r\npoint: Detroit is one of the greatest stove manufacturing cities in the\r\nUnited States. Records show that pig iron is being shipped from Florence\r\nto Detroit, and that finished stoves are being shipped from Detroit to\r\nFlorence. Labor is cheaper in Florence than in Detroit. Fuel is cheaper,\r\nwater is cheaper, and in fact everything is cheaper. The Florence\r\nfoundries can make and ship a finished casting to northern points for\r\nthe same rate the raw material can be shipped, and yet a great deal of\r\nthe finished product finds its way back to Florence and points further\r\nSouth. There are a thousand arguments in favor of Florence, and none\r\nagainst her. Everything is better and conditions are better in every way.\r\nThe climate is elegant, scenery sublime, and one of the most healthy\r\nlocations in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jefferson Hotel, Florence, Ala.]\r\n\r\nA story of Florence without mention of their excellent street railway\r\nwould not be complete. The Sheffield Company operate a line of cars\r\nbetween Florence, Sheffield and Tuscumbia, that are strictly up-to-date,\r\nand the same attention is paid to the wants of the people as though\r\nthey were compelled to fight an aggressive competitor for every fare.\r\nThese cars connect the L. & N. and Southern depots, and give Florence\r\na service that they are proud of and appreciate. There is a friendly\r\nrivalry existing between the cities of Florence, Sheffield and Tuscumbia,\r\nas there always is when towns are located close together, and to ask a\r\nman in Sheffield what he thought of Florence, he would look as though he\r\nnever heard of the place, and to ask a man in Florence what he thought\r\nof Sheffield, he would say that any man living in Sheffield when he\r\ncould just as well live in Florence should be fined and imprisoned on\r\nsuspicion, but in dividing his favors in the way of street car service,\r\nMr. J. W. Worthington, the Vice President and active man, is impartial,\r\nand gives all three cities a service that is strictly first-class.\r\n\r\nThe Sheffield Company also furnish electric lights and power to Florence,\r\nand are daily improving the service and extending their wires.\r\n\r\nFlorence could well be called a “City of Schools and Churches,” for in\r\nthat respect they are far above the average city. Their schools, as\r\nbefore mentioned, are of the highest order, and their churches represent\r\nall denominations. There is the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Trinity\r\nEpiscopal, Catholic and Christian. The people are unusually devoted to\r\nthe churches, and contribute liberally to their support.\r\n\r\nFlorence now has approximately three miles of cement sidewalks and is\r\nnow advertising for bids for the construction of twenty-seven miles\r\nadditional. Florence will use something like ten million brick within the\r\nnext few months, as several large buildings are now being constructed and\r\nthe plans are being drawn for many more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Philadelphia Furnace, Florence, Ala., owned by\r\nSloss-Sheffield Co. Daily capacity, 200 tons. Employs 175 men.]\r\n\r\nFlorence now has industries that represent a money investment of about\r\none and a half million dollars, fine schools and churches, street\r\nrailway, electric lights and gas, honest city government, an up-to-date\r\nand efficient fire department, police protection, telegraph, telephones,\r\npublic parks, and in fact everything required to make it a desirable\r\nplace to engage in business and to reside. It will welcome new industries\r\nand good citizens. It is in need of various industries to use the waste\r\nmaterial from the wagon works, stave factories and planing mills, and can\r\noffer greater inducements to parties interested than any other city in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to this intelligent city, filled, as it is, with\r\nschools, colleges and churches, not to make mention of its valuable\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 1885 it has continued to furnish to the reading\r\npublic of Florence the best literature, consisting of prose and poetry,\r\nhistory, science and fiction.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 2,000 volumes, well shelved and properly cared for.\r\nThe library, while not entirely free, is open to all, and intended for\r\nall. One day of every week books can be procured and a membership fee of\r\n$1.00 per year is charged, this amount being used for the purchase of the\r\nnew books, a stipulated sum being spent each year for historical works\r\nand reference books for students.\r\n\r\nThe books are carefully selected when purchased, there being a special\r\nbook committee charged with this duty. The library is under the direction\r\nof twelve lady directors, selected for their special fitness for the\r\nwork. They are:\r\n\r\nMrs. Erister Ashcraft, President; Mrs. John R. Price, Vice President;\r\nMrs. Emmet O’Neal, Secretary; Mrs. L. M. Humphries, Treasurer; Mrs. W. P.\r\nCampbell, Mrs. C. E. Jordan, Mrs. H. B. Lee, Miss Nettie Simpson, Mrs. M.\r\nW. Cample, Mrs. M. C. Nelson, Mrs. L. B. Frierson, Mrs. G. N.

It is only a matter of a short time when the hitherto\r\nwasted energy of Mussel Shoals will be harnessed into a power, second\r\nonly to that of Niagara.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSSEL SHOALS CANAL.\r\n\r\nAqueduct. 900 feet long.\r\n\r\nAqueduct spanning Shoals Creek.\r\n\r\nLock 9, where Mussel Shoals Canal opens into Tennessee River.]\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning these immense falls, but it is the\r\npurpose of this article to give only such facts as will be of interest\r\nand practical use to prospective developers of this great power, and to\r\nthose who are to help build up this beautiful valley into one of the\r\nbusiest manufacturing centers in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn a general way the value and importance of this great power is\r\nexpressed by one of the ablest American engineers who has examined and\r\nsurveyed these shoals: “There is no place in the world where greater\r\nadvantages are to be found for the harnessing of water power for the uses\r\nof industry, or where there is greater power awaiting development within\r\nreach of the seaboard by water and by rail transportation than Mussel\r\nShoals.”\r\n\r\nThe following, from the report of Chief Engineer F. H. Newell, and\r\nincorporated by Senator Morgan in his recent report to the Senate on the\r\n“Navigation of the Tennessee River,” is reproduced here as being the most\r\naccurate and authentic account of the various important features of the\r\nMussel Shoals with reference to their capacity for developing power:\r\n\r\n“In the Tennessee river, in the vicinity of Florence, Ala., are several\r\nshoals capable of the development of power.\r\n\r\n“The shoals are a succession of cascades, amid many islands, in a river\r\nbed varying in width from a half-mile to three miles. The difference\r\nbetween high and low water is only five or six feet, corresponding to a\r\nrise of fifty feet at Chattanooga. Beginning at Brown’s Ferry, twelve\r\nmiles below Decatur, Ala., the river has the following falls:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9—Map showing shoals in Tennessee River near\r\nFlorence.]\r\n\r\n“From Brown’s Ferry to the mouth of Elk river the fall is twenty-six\r\nfeet in eleven miles. This is known as ‘Elk River Shoals.’ Its most\r\nprecipitous part is at the lower end, where there is a fall of 16.5 feet\r\nin about four miles.\r\n\r\n“From the mouth of Elk river to the head of Mussel Shoals, a distance of\r\nfive miles, there is a fall of only two feet.\r\n\r\n“From the head of Mussel Shoals to Bainbridge the fall is eighty-five\r\nfeet in seventeen miles, and is known as ‘Mussel Shoals.’\r\n\r\n“From Bainbridge to Florence the fall is twenty-three feet in seven\r\nmiles, and is known as ‘Little Mussel Shoals.’\r\n\r\n“From Florence to the head of Colbert Shoals the fall is three feet in\r\neleven miles.\r\n\r\n“From the head of Colbert Shoals to Waterloo is, therefore, 160 feet in\r\na distance of fifty-seven miles. Sixteen miles of the distance, however,\r\nhas a fall of only five feet, leaving a fall of 155 feet in forty-one\r\nmiles that cover the four shoals mentioned. The shoals are really more\r\nprecipitous than the foregoing figures would indicate. For instance, 84.6\r\nfeet of the fall at Mussel Shoals is in a distance of fourteen miles.”\r\n\r\nThe general surface of the water on these shoals is comparatively smooth\r\nand of even depth in its levels across the river, with no deep fissures\r\nto interfere with the building of dams at any location that may be\r\nselected. The islets and projecting rocks can be taken into the structure\r\nof the dams at a considerable advantage in the cost of such works.\r\n\r\nThe bed and banks of the river are only subject to slight changes, and\r\nimprovements, when made, are therefore practically permanent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSSEL SHOALS CANAL.\r\n\r\nLock 7, looking down Canal.\r\n\r\nArch Bridge at Lock 6.\r\n\r\nLock 4.]\r\n\r\nThis section of the Tennessee river runs through a fertile and beautiful\r\nupland, presenting on both shores bluffs or rock of strong texture that\r\nafford very extensive and excellent quarries for all structural purposes,\r\nwhile the rocks for the rougher work of dam construction are abundantly\r\nsupplied in the bed of the river. These bluffs break away into beautiful\r\nfarm lands, and the high lands and salubrious climate insure healthful\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nDirectly tributary are all the elements necessary for a great\r\nmanufacturing center.\r\n\r\nThe nearby iron, coal and phosphate fields are among the richest in\r\nthe world, and the supply of lime- and sandstone for manufacturing and\r\nbuilding purposes is inexhaustible. Forests of timber of both hard and\r\nsoft woods of every description are near at hand, and bordering the river\r\nbanks from Chattanooga to Johnsonville are the most productive cotton\r\nfields of the South. Labor is skilled and plentiful.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to develop this great power heretofore, as the\r\ngovernment has refused to allow the construction of dams across the\r\nriver, but by the recent Act of Congress such permission has been granted.\r\n\r\nWith the immense supply of raw material of every kind in this section,\r\nsufficient manufacturing industries may be added here to consume\r\nthe power generated from these shoals, making us the most important\r\nmanufacturers of wood, iron, cotton, etc., in the United States.\r\n\r\nEstimated minimum net horsepower of Tennessee river in Alabama on\r\nturbines realizing eighty per cent. of the theoretical power:\r\n\r\n    ---------------------+------+-------------+-------------\r\n    LOCALITY             |Fall  |Minimum      |Minimum\r\n                         |      |net power in |net power in\r\n                         |      |driest years |average years\r\n    ---------------------+------+-------------+-------------\r\n                         |Ft.   |             |\r\n    Elk River Shoals     | 26   | 15,600      | 30,550\r\n    Mussel Shoals        | 85   | 51,000      | 99,875\r\n    Little Mussel Shoals | 23   | 13,800      | 27,025\r\n    Colbert Shoals       | 21   | 12,600      | 24,675\r\n                         +------+-------------+-------------\r\n      Total              |155   | 93,000      |182,125\r\n    ---------------------+------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the present general manager of the Tennessee Valley Fertilizer\r\nCompany started in business some seven years ago, his stock in trade\r\nconsisted of plenty of pluck and a hoe. With the assistance of one man,\r\nhe mixed his fertilizer with a hoe, and the first day’s output was eleven\r\nbags of fertilizer. The first week showed up a total of 55 bags. Without\r\ntelling of the seven years of hard and persistent work, will say that any\r\nof the eight mills in this plant to-day can mix as much fertilizer in\r\ntwenty minutes as they did the first week. There is probably no brand of\r\nfertilizer sold to-day in any market that gives more satisfaction than\r\ntheir famous “Tiger” brand, for in this formula is represented the very\r\nbest work of the general manager, who has given practically every hour of\r\nhis time to the upbuilding of the business, and his motto is: “The Very\r\nBest That Can be Produced.”\r\n\r\nThe company own their own phosphate fields in Maury and Hickman counties,\r\nTennessee, and daily receive shipments of the raw material, where it is\r\nquickly converted into their forty different brands. “King Cotton Grower”\r\nis probably their most popular seller, as it is especially adapted to the\r\ngrowing of cotton, and no expense has been spared to make it perfect,\r\nand as imitation is a sure sign of superiority, the company have been\r\ncompelled upon several occasions to fight for their rights to use this\r\nname for their product. No better recommendation for their goods could\r\nbe given than the fact that their very best customers and friends are\r\nthe ones that started to buy their goods when the company was first\r\norganized, and who have continued to stand by them in their fight to give\r\nthe people the very best. They make a special study of the needs of the\r\nfarmer, and make their formulas accordingly, and while it is safe to say\r\nthat it would be hard to improve on their different brands, which are\r\nall made with scientific accuracy, yet they are always ready to make any\r\nspecial formulas, and will take such orders and deliver them promptly.\r\n\r\nGrowing to such proportions in such few years and fighting the trust at\r\nthe same time is certainly a record that could not be built on anything\r\nbut honest principles and meritorious goods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Florence Wagon Works was established in 1882 in Atlanta, Ga. Was\r\nreorganized and moved to Florence, Ala., in 1889, and has been in\r\nconstant operation since that time.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve years ending with 1905, this company has manufactured\r\nand distributed over 89,000 farm wagons, paying to its employees for\r\nlabor and salary something over $797,000. The volume of business has\r\nbeen considerably more than $3,000,000. During that time it has paid to\r\nthe railroads more than $200,000 for freight. These figures will give an\r\napproximate idea of the extent of business done by this institution.\r\n\r\nIt is in the heart of the very best supply of hard wood for wagon\r\npurposes. Being situated only across the river from the large furnaces\r\nand rolling mills of Sheffield it is enabled to secure its supply of iron\r\nunder the most favorable conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORENCE WAGON WORKS.\r\n\r\nFellow Shed, Florence Wagon Works.\r\n\r\nView from top of paint shop.\r\n\r\nLane in box board yard.]\r\n\r\nThe entire factory is equipped with the most modern machinery for\r\nmanufacturing and handling its large output, which is growing in\r\npopularity every year and the territory covered is being extended\r\nannually, now reaching from Virginia to Mexico, and from the Atlantic\r\ncoast to the far West.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of Florence, is the Cypress Creek\r\ndam, on the land of Mr. F. M. Perry. There is a great opportunity for\r\nthe development of sufficient electric power to supply the needs of\r\nFlorence, and taking the figures of a prominent surveyor at Florence,\r\nit is estimated that this dam will furnish something like 12,000 horse\r\npower daily. The owner is reluctant to make any statement as to the\r\npossibilities, but prefers to let those interested investigate. We print\r\nherein a picture of the old dam that was in use before the war, and the\r\npresent owner started to rebuild it some time ago, but before it was\r\ncompleted, a heavy rise washed away a part of it and he has made no\r\nfurther progress. The creek makes a big bend, and while it is some three\r\nmiles around, by tunnelling through some 600 feet, it will give a fall\r\nof thirty feet, and by building a dam at the site of the present dam, or\r\nrather by finishing the one partly constructed, elevating it ten feet,\r\nit will back the water of Cypress Creek to a point where a tunnel of 300\r\nfeet will give a forty foot fall, and will discharge at the point shown\r\nin the second picture of the old cotton factory that was destroyed during\r\nthe war, and which was never rebuilt. There is something like 1,000\r\nacres of land with this privilege and to sum the whole thing up, taking\r\nthe estimate made by City Engineer Major A. G. Negley, as a basis, an\r\nexpenditure of $2,000 to finish the dam, $6,000 for the tunnel and $2,000\r\nfor the turbine would give electricity to furnish power enough to meet\r\nall the demands of Florence and the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore the war there were three dams practically in sight of each other\r\nthat furnished the power for a grist mill and two cotton factories.\r\n\r\nFor further information, address the owner, F. M. Perry, Florence,\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Manual Training Department of the Alabama State Normal under the\r\nsupervision of Prof. F. T. Nisbet, is one of the most interesting\r\nparts of Florence. Mr. Nisbet is a graduate of Atheneum and Mechanics\r\nInstitute, Rochester, N. Y., and was at the head of manual training in\r\nthe city schools of Yonkers, N. Y. He introduced manual training in the\r\nUniversity of Alabama where he taught for two years at the summer school\r\nfor teachers. It enables a pupil to demonstrate their ideas, and tends to\r\ndevelop the ability to express their thoughts in many ways. The Manual\r\nTraining Department in Florence ranks with the very best in the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nASHCRAFT COTTON FACTORY.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say anything of interest in regard to this institution\r\nother than what is stated in their advertisement. It was organized in\r\n1900 with a capital stock of $100,000, which was increased the following\r\nyear to $150,000. Their goods are in such demand that they are several\r\nmonths behind on orders, and, as stated, in their advertisement, are\r\nthe first company in the United States to use the entire product of\r\nthe cotton field. The factory contains 6,240 spindles and 200 looms,\r\nemploying several hundred hands. The factory is one of the best equipped\r\nand most up-to-date factories in the United States, and the fact that\r\ntheir product is sold for several months ahead is conclusive evidence\r\nthat their goods are of unusual merit. C. W. Ashcraft is President and\r\nGeneral Manager, John T. Ashcraft, Vice President, and Erister Ashcraft,\r\nSecretary and Treasurer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two accompanying pictures of “Light Running Florence” wagons tell\r\nmore than could be told in several pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe 3½ Florence Wagon that brought a load of 86 people to the fair at\r\nMurfreesboro, carried an estimated weight of 13,000 pounds, or six times\r\nas much as the ordinary farmer hauls at a load. The ordinary log wagon\r\nis seldom called on to hold up a load to exceed four or five thousand\r\npounds, and oftener less, yet the “Light Running Florence” managed to\r\ncarry a solid stone base weighing 22,000 pounds, and without injury to\r\nthe wagon in any way. There must be a reason for this. If the wagons were\r\nbuilt to conform with the claims of the Florence Wagon Works, as to the\r\namount of tonnage capacity, they would certainly not be misleading the\r\npublic or the purchaser, but when a wagon will carry more than five times\r\nas much as they claim it will, and ten times as much as the ordinary\r\nfarmer wants to haul, there is but one answer; the wagon is built on\r\nhonor. It would be pretty hard to get anything but an honest wagon from\r\nthis factory, for unless a man be honest with himself, he could not be\r\nhonest with his employer, and the record for industry, temperance, and\r\ngeneral citizenship is certainly broken when you investigate the class\r\nof men that make these wagons. Many of the employes own their own homes,\r\ncontribute liberally to churches and charity and patronize the schools,\r\nand a larger Sunday school class can be found from the children of this\r\nindustrious lot of people than can be found most anywhere, considering\r\nthe number of employes. There is not a “boozefighter” in their employ,\r\nand the standard of manhood and citizenship is certainty commendable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _3½ FLORENCE WAGON CARRYING A LOAD OF 86 PASSENGERS,\r\nESTIMATED WEIGHT 13,000 LBS._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ashcraft Oil Mills is one of the tributary industries of the Ashcraft\r\nCotton Mills, where the by-products are handled, and is under the same\r\nmanagement. In addition they operate several gins in the territory\r\nadjacent to Florence, to insure an adequate supply of seed for the\r\nmanufacture of their product. Several years ago when there was little\r\nor no demand for cotton seed hulls, they advertised that they would for\r\na limited time give away absolutely free their output of cotton seed\r\nhulls that the farmers and stock raisers might learn of its value as a\r\nfeed. It was rather hard at first to give them away, but it resulted in\r\ncreating a demand until now the entire output is sold with little or no\r\nadvertising.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe print on this page the picture of Hon.

He is a son of the late Governor O’Neal, and it is\r\nonly fitting that he should in time succeed his illustrious father. Mr.\r\nO’Neal is best liked where best known, and if the people of Florence\r\nwere the only ones to be consulted his election would be unanimous. He\r\nis a native of Lauderdale County, and has always been a prominent factor\r\nin the Democratic affairs of the State.

The manager is a practical hotel man, and can\r\nadapt himself to circumstances. His chef quit a short time ago, and\r\nMr. Negley cooked the breakfast. The only difference noticeable was an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n“Don’t use any space telling about me,” said Mr. Richardson, of the Acme\r\nLumber Company. “What we want is to advertise Florence, and it you have\r\nanything nice to say, say it about our growing little city. I am willing\r\nto pay my part; don’t wish any personal bouquets.”\r\n\r\nThe Alabama Stove Company sell more goods than they can make, yet they\r\ncut the conversation short by saying: “We are in for anything that will\r\nhelp Florence.” Their advertisement is inserted in order that they might\r\nhave an excuse for helping to “boost.” Mr. Berger seems to have the habit\r\nof “boosting” on the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nIt you are interested in Florence, or wish to know anything about\r\nFlorence, we publish the advertisement of the representative real estate\r\nfirms, and we can assure you that facts are their main assets.
