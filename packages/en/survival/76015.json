The three\r\nkinds of mint grown in this country for the distillation of peppermint\r\noil are the so-called American mint (_Mentha piperita_ L.), the black\r\nmint (_Mentha piperita vulgaris_ Sole), and the white mint (_Mentha\r\npiperita officinalis_ Sole), the two last named being varieties of the\r\nAmerican mint.\r\n\r\nThe American mint, although introduced from England many years ago,\r\nis so called from the fact that it has long been cultivated in this\r\ncountry, and the name “State mint” has been applied to it in the State\r\nof New York for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe peppermint, or American mint, is now naturalized in many parts of\r\nthe eastern United States, occurring in wet soil from the New England\r\nStates to Minnesota, south to Florida and Tennessee. It is an aromatic\r\nperennial belonging to the mint family (Menthaceæ), and propagates by\r\nmeans of its long, running roots (fig. 1). The smooth, square stems are\r\nerect and branching, from 1 to 3 feet in height, bearing dark-green,\r\nlance-shaped leaves, which are from 1 to 2 inches long, and from\r\none-half to 1 inch wide. The leaves are pointed at the apex, rounded or\r\nnarrowed at the base, sharply toothed, smooth on both sides, or with\r\nhairy veins on the lower surface. The flowers are borne in whorls in\r\ndense, terminal spikes; they are purplish, with a tubular, five-toothed\r\ncalyx, and a four-lobed corolla. (Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Peppermint “runners,” showing method of\r\npropagation.]\r\n\r\nThe two varieties mentioned are closely related botanically, although\r\nin general appearance they are quite different. The variety known as\r\nblack mint (_Mentha piperita vulgaris_) has purple stems and slightly\r\ntoothed, dark-green leaves, while the white mint (_Mentha piperita\r\nofficinalis_) has green stems, with brighter green leaves, which are\r\nmore lance-shaped and more deeply toothed. Black mint is much more\r\nhardy and productive than either the American mint or the white mint,\r\nand is grown on nearly all peppermint farms in this country. The\r\nwhite mint, which produces a fine grade of oil, is rarely cultivated\r\non a commercial scale in this country on account of its inability to\r\nwithstand the climate and its smaller yield of essential oil.\r\n\r\nThe oils spoken of as Japanese and Chinese “peppermint” oils are\r\nnot obtained from the true peppermint plant, but are distilled from\r\nentirely different species, namely, _Mentha arvensis piperascens_\r\nMalinvaud and _Mentha arvensis glabrata_ Holmes, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRIES WHERE GROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important peppermint-producing countries are the United\r\nStates, England, and Japan. Peppermint is grown on a smaller scale in\r\nGermany, France, Italy, Russia, China, and southern India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Leaves and flowering top of peppermint.]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, peppermint cultivation is said to have been undertaken\r\nbefore the Christian era. The plant grown there is not, as already\r\nstated, the peppermint cultivated in our country, but _Mentha arvensis\r\npiperascens_, which is entirely distinct from the true peppermint, not\r\nonly botanically but also in taste and odor.\r\n\r\nPeppermint is cultivated on many drug farms in England, especially at\r\nMitcham, the middle of the eighteenth century marking the beginning of\r\npeppermint cultivation in that country. Up to 1805, however, there were\r\nno stills at Mitcham, and the crops obtained there were sent to London\r\nfor distillation. About 1850, at which time the peppermint industry in\r\nEngland was at its height, the effect of American competition began to\r\nbe felt, and caused a decided check in the production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In response to a steady demand for information relating to the\r\npeppermint industry, Miss Alice Henkel, Assistant in Drug-Plant\r\nInvestigations, has been requested to bring together the most important\r\nfacts regarding the history, culture, and utilization of the peppermint\r\nplant. The information here presented has been obtained in large part\r\nfrom scattered articles on the subject, and in part from experience\r\nwith the plant in the Testing Gardens of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n  RODNEY H. TRUE, _Physiologist in Charge_.\r\n\r\n  OFFICE OF DRUG-PLANT INVESTIGATIONS.\r\n  _Washington, D. C., October 14, 1905._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERMINT CULTIVATION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWayne County, N. Y., in 1816, was the first locality in this country\r\nto distill peppermint on a commercial scale. The supply of rootstocks\r\nwas obtained from the wild plants found growing along the banks of\r\nstreams and brooks. Adjacent counties soon undertook the cultivation\r\nof peppermint, but Wayne County was then, and is now, the principal\r\npeppermint district in New York.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of peppermint was extended to Ashtabula, Geauga, and\r\nCuyahoga counties in Ohio, and also to northern Indiana. Roots were\r\ntaken from Ohio into St. Joseph County, Mich., the first plantation\r\nbeing made on Pigeon prairie in 1835. Other plantations in St.\r\nJoseph County were established the following years, and adjoining\r\ncounties soon took up the cultivation of peppermint, and southwestern\r\nMichigan has been for thirty-five years or more the greatest\r\npeppermint-producing section in the United States.\r\n\r\nAbout 1844 an interesting peppermint oil monopoly[2] was undertaken\r\nby a New York firm, which seems to have put an end to peppermint\r\ncultivation in Ohio, for none of the counties just mentioned has since\r\nbeen heard from as a peppermint-producing section.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by this New York firm in its efforts to control\r\nthe peppermint oil market was to send a representative to Liverpool,\r\nEngland, to ascertain the amount annually demanded by that market,\r\nwhich was found to be about 12,000 pounds. This done, another agent\r\nwas sent West to determine the amount produced annually, with the\r\nresult that it was found that the farms in New York did not produce\r\nenough oil for their purposes, the plantations in Ohio too much, while\r\nthose in Michigan seemed to produce just about the right amount to\r\nsatisfy the Liverpool demand. A contract was then entered into by\r\nthis agent with the producers in New York and Ohio “whereby he bound\r\nthem under heavy penalties to plow up their mint fields and destroy\r\nthe roots, and not plant any more mint, or sell or give away any\r\nroots, or produce or sell any mint oil for the period of five years.”\r\nFor this wholesale destruction of their mint fields the producers\r\nreceived a bonus of $1.50 per acre. Next a contract was made by the\r\nagent with the producers of St. Joseph County, Mich., agreeing to pay\r\nthem $2.50 a pound for their mint oil, every ounce of the mint oil to\r\nbe delivered for a period of five years to the agents named in the\r\ncontract. They also were prohibited during this period from extending\r\ntheir plantations and from selling roots to anyone. The producers held\r\nto these contracts for about three years, after which period the New\r\nYork firm was not so anxious to enforce them, having, in the meantime,\r\nacquired a large fortune through its peppermint oil monopoly.\r\n\r\nSince that period the area devoted to peppermint cultivation in\r\nMichigan has steadily increased, and northern Indiana, with its\r\nprincipal centers of production in St. Joseph, Steuben, and La Grange\r\ncounties, continues to place on the market a considerable quantity of\r\noil. Ohio seems to have abandoned peppermint cultivation, at least on\r\na commercial scale, and New York, for a number of years and until very\r\nrecently, had greatly reduced the area under peppermint, thousands of\r\nacres formerly devoted to this crop having been given over to sugar\r\nbeets, onions, and celery. In 1889 Wayne County, N. Y., had 3,325 acres\r\nof peppermint, whereas in 1899 there were only 300 acres. In 1905,\r\nabout 933 acres were under cultivation.\r\n\r\nSpecial canvassers appointed by the State of Michigan[3] made a canvass\r\nof 299 growers in the peppermint district in that State, covering 39\r\ntownships in nine counties (Allegan, Berrien, Branch, Cass, Kalamazoo,\r\nOakland, St. Joseph, St. Clair, and Van Buren), and the total number\r\nof acres under peppermint cultivation, the number of pounds of oil\r\ndistilled, and the average number of pounds per acre, as ascertained by\r\nthis canvass, for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————+——————————+——————————+—————————\r\n               Items.               |  1900.   |  1901.   |  1902.\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————+——————————+——————————+—————————\r\n  Total number of acres grown       |  2,112   |  2,782½  |  6,400⅔\r\n  Total number of pounds distilled  | 47,628½  | 63,718¾  | 82,420¼\r\n  Average number of pounds per acre |     22.5 |     23.9 |     12.8\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————+——————————+——————————+—————————\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Proc.

These muck lands were formerly marshes and swamps, which\r\nhave been reclaimed by draining, plowing, and cultivating, the swamp\r\nvegetation having been thus subdued, and the decayed vegetable matter\r\nresulting in a very black soil which is most admirably adapted to mint\r\ncultivation. Formerly peppermint was grown exclusively on upland soil\r\nin Michigan, but it is a very exhausting crop on such land. Only two\r\ncrops can be obtained from upland plantations, and after the second\r\nyear’s harvest the land is plowed and a rotation of clover, corn, etc.,\r\nis practiced for five years before peppermint is again planted. But on\r\nthe rich muck land peppermint can be grown year after year for six or\r\nseven years, the land being plowed up after each crop is harvested, and\r\nthe runners turned under to form a new growth the succeeding year. The\r\nground is harrowed in autumn and again in spring, and carefully weeded.\r\nPeppermint will grow, however, on any land that will produce good crops\r\nof corn, the ground being prepared by deep plowing and harrowing.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan[4] the land is plowed in the autumn, and early in spring\r\nit is harrowed and marked with furrows about 3 feet apart. The roots\r\nselected for planting are from one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch\r\nthick, and from 1 to 3 feet long; and the workmen engaged in “setting\r\nmint,” as the process is called, carry these roots in sacks across\r\ntheir shoulders and place them in the furrows by hand, covering the\r\nroots with one foot and stepping on them with the other. The roots are\r\nplanted so close together in the furrow as to form a continuous line.\r\nAn expert workman can plant about an acre in a day.\r\n\r\nIn about two weeks the young plants will make their appearance, and are\r\ncarefully hoed and cultivated until July and August, when the plants\r\nhave usually sent out so many runners as to make further cultivation\r\ndifficult. The crop is cultivated with horse cultivators, but if the\r\nland was very weedy in the first place, the weeds will have to be\r\npulled by hand. It is very necessary that the land be free from weeds,\r\nas any collected with the peppermint crop will seriously injure the\r\nquality of the oil.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to note here that on muck lands, when necessary,\r\nthe horses are usually provided with mud shoes to prevent their sinking\r\ninto the soft, wet ground, these mud shoes consisting of wide pieces of\r\niron or wood about 9 by 10 inches, fastened to the hoofs and ordinary\r\nshoes by means of bolts and straps.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS INJURIOUS TO CROP.\r\n\r\nCold and wet weather or extremely dry periods have a very unfavorable\r\neffect on the mint crop. Insect enemies also tend to cut down the\r\nmint harvest—grasshoppers, crickets, and cutworms sometimes doing\r\nconsiderable damage. A rust, causing the foliage to drop off and\r\nleaving the stems almost bare, is apt to follow if very moist weather\r\noccurs toward the latter part of the season. Weeds are especially to\r\nbe avoided in a mint field, since, as stated, the quality of the oil\r\nwill be seriously impaired if these are harvested with the peppermint.\r\nThe weeds generally found in a peppermint field are Canada fleabane\r\n(_Leptilon canadense_), fireweed (_Erechtites hieracifolia_), giant\r\nragweed (_Ambrosia trifida_), pennyroyal (_Hedeoma pulegioides_),\r\nEaton’s grass (_Eatonia pennsylvanica_), June grass (_Poa pratensis_),\r\nand other low grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Twentieth Annual Report of the Bureau of Labor of the State of\r\nMichigan, 1903, pp. 438-447.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING AND DISTILLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first crop of mint is harvested in the latter part of August, when\r\nthe plants are in full flower, and the gathering continues until about\r\nthe middle of September, the stills running night and day until all\r\nthe mint is disposed of. The first crop is usually cut with a scythe,\r\nas mowing machines do not work well on soft cultivated land. The\r\nsucceeding crops are cut with a mowing machine or sweep-rake reaper.\r\nThe highest yield per acre and the best quality of oil are obtained\r\nfrom the first year’s crop. Sometimes, if the weather conditions have\r\nbeen very favorable, a second cutting is made. The yield of oil from\r\npeppermint obtained from the same field sometimes varies very much, the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere seeming to exert an influence upon it, as\r\nit is said that mint cut after a warm and humid night will yield more\r\noil than that cut after a cool and dry night. It requires about 330\r\npounds of dried peppermint to produce 1 pound of oil, and the yield of\r\noil from an acre ranges from 12 to 50 pounds.\r\n\r\nIf the mint crop has been grown on muck land, all that is necessary\r\nafter the crop has been harvested is to plow up the land and turn the\r\nrunners under for a new crop. If grown on upland, after the second\r\nyear’s crop is in, or, at the most, after the third year’s harvest, the\r\nland is plowed and then given up to other crops. Peppermint exhausts\r\nthe land, and it is necessary to practice rotation of crops for about\r\nfive years in order to put the land in condition if it is desired to\r\nuse it again for peppermint cultivation.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants are cut they are usually placed in windrows until they\r\nare dried, but are not allowed to become so dry as to permit the leaves\r\nto shatter off, and are then taken to the distillery. Some growers\r\nbelieve that if the plants are allowed to dry there will be a smaller\r\noil content owing to the escape of some of the oil into the atmosphere,\r\nand so have the plants brought to the distillery in the green state;\r\nbut Mr. A. M. Todd[5] is of the opinion that no loss of oil will\r\nresult from drying, his experiments along this line showing that the\r\ndry plants can be distilled three times as rapidly as the green plants,\r\nand that a larger quantity of oil may be obtained. He states that—\r\n\r\n To obtain the best results, both as to quality of essential oil and\r\n economy of transportation and distillation, the plants should be dried\r\n as thoroughly as possible without endangering the loss of the leaves\r\n in handling. Distillation should then take place as soon as convenient\r\n to prevent the oxidation of the oil in the leaf by atmospheric action.\r\n\r\nThe smaller producers, who have no stills of their own, have their mint\r\ncrop hauled to the nearest peppermint distillery, where it is distilled\r\nfor them at a cost of 25 cents per pound of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Amer. Jour. Pharm., 60: 328-332 (1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used in peppermint distillation in the early years of the\r\nindustry in this country consisted of a copper kettle, from the top\r\nof which a pipe connected with a condensing “worm.” Water was placed\r\nin the kettle and the plants were immersed in it, and direct heat was\r\napplied to the bottom from a furnace. With such a still only about 15\r\npounds of oil could be obtained from a charge. In 1846, large wooden\r\nvats were substituted for the copper kettles, and the plants were\r\ndistilled by steam passing through them. The kettle formerly used as\r\nthe still was now employed to generate steam, a long pipe conveying the\r\nsteam to the bottom of the vats. With this method of distillation from\r\n75 to 100 pounds of oil could be obtained from a charge without much\r\nadditional expense.\r\n\r\nA modern peppermint still (fig. 3) may be briefly described as follows:\r\nThe apparatus required consists of a boiler, a pair of large circular\r\nwooden vats, a condenser, and a receiver. The boiler, of course, is\r\nused for the generation of steam.\r\n\r\nTwo wooden vats are used in order that they may be filled and emptied\r\nalternately. These vats are about 6 feet high and about 5 feet in\r\ndiameter, with tight-fitting removable covers and perforated false\r\nbottoms. Steam pipes are led from the boiler into the bottom of the\r\nvats.\r\n\r\nThe condenser consists of a series of pipes of block tin, either\r\nimmersed in tanks of cold water or over which cold water is kept\r\nrunning, the condenser being connected with the top of the distilling\r\nvats. The condensed steam, together with the oil, flows into a metallic\r\nreceiver, in which the oil, being lighter than the water, rises to the\r\ntop and can be drawn off.\r\n\r\nThe perforated false bottoms with which the vats are supplied permit\r\nthe passage of steam. A strong iron hoop is placed about this false\r\nbottom, and two pairs of stout chains, which meet at the top of the\r\nvat in a pair of rings, are attached to it. After the charge has been\r\ndistilled it is drawn from the vats by means of this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe plants are thrown into the vats and are closely packed by two or\r\nthree men tramping upon them, and as the vat becomes about one-third\r\nfull the packing is still further assisted by turning in a small supply\r\nof steam, which softens the plants. When the vat is filled the tight\r\ncover is replaced and a full head of steam turned on. In the largest\r\ndistilleries the vats have a capacity of from 2,000 to 3,000 pounds of\r\ndried plants each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Peppermint still.

It is also used for flavoring and\r\nscenting confectionery, cordials, and cosmetics. There is a slight\r\ndifference in the odor of white and black peppermint oil, the black\r\nbeing more pungent and less agreeable in fragrance than the white,\r\nwhich has a much finer odor, but, as already indicated, the white mint\r\nis less hardy than the black and yields a smaller quantity of oil.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese oil of peppermint, which, as pointed out elsewhere in\r\nthese pages, is obtained from a different species of mint than that\r\nwhich produces the true oil of peppermint, is very inferior to the last\r\nnamed. It has a very unpleasant odor and a bitter, disagreeable taste,\r\nbut it is a heavy oil and contains a higher percentage of menthol and,\r\nbeing a very much cheaper oil, it is liable to be used as an adulterant\r\nof true peppermint oil.\r\n\r\nMenthol, formerly known as peppermint camphor, is the solid constituent\r\nof oil of peppermint, obtained by subjecting the distilled oil to\r\nan exceedingly low temperature by means of a freezing mixture. Its\r\nproperties are about the same as those of oil of peppermint, only\r\nsomewhat intensified. It is very largely made up into cones or pencils,\r\nwhich furnish a popular remedy, to be applied externally or inhaled,\r\nfor the relief of headache, neuralgia, catarrh, asthma, and kindred\r\naffections. It is also largely employed in other forms of medication.\r\nThe name “pipmenthol” has been applied to the menthol obtained from the\r\nAmerican oil, to distinguish it from the Japanese menthol. Pipmenthol\r\nis said to have a distinct odor of peppermint, while the Japanese\r\nmenthol has but a slight peppermint odor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPORT OF PEPPERMINT OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exports of peppermint oil during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1904, amounted to 42,939 pounds, valued at $124,728.

The lowest price paid for it was in 1899, when it brought only\r\n75 cents per pound. As a result of the low price a great many mint\r\nfarmers restricted the area of their mint plantations or altogether\r\nabandoned peppermint cultivation. The smaller output of the following\r\nseasons again sent prices up, and in 1902 the oil sold as high as\r\n$4.75 a pound, which price was maintained until early in 1903, when it\r\ngradually declined, until toward the end of that year it reached $2.20\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\nThe following table[8] gives the highest and lowest prices of\r\npeppermint oil in bulk from 1873 to September 16, 1905:\r\n\r\n  ———————+————————+———————\r\n   Year. |Highest.|Lowest.\r\n  ———————+————————+———————\r\n  1873   |  $3.15 | $3.15\r\n  1874   |   5.25 |  3.75\r\n  1875   |   5.50 |  3.20\r\n  1876   |   3.75 |  2.40\r\n  1877   |   3.00 |  1.75\r\n  1878   |   2.00 |  1.50\r\n  1879   |   2.65 |  1.45\r\n  1880   |   2.87 |  2.60\r\n  1881   |   2.85 |  2.35\r\n  1882   |   2.50 |  2.25\r\n  1883   |   2.60 |  2.20\r\n  1884   |   3.00 |  2.50\r\n  1885   |   4.37 |  2.75\r\n  1886   |   3.60 |  2.75\r\n  1887   |   2.75 |  1.90\r\n  1888   |   2.40 |  1.75\r\n  1889   |   2.30 |  1.80\r\n  1890   |   2.40 |  1.80\r\n  1891   |   2.50 |  2.45\r\n  1892   |   2.50 |  2.15\r\n  1893   |   2.45 |  2.15\r\n  1894   |   2.45 |  1.70\r\n  1895   |   2.00 |  1.70\r\n  1896   |   1.85 |  1.20\r\n  1897   |   1.25 |   .90\r\n  1898   |    .90 |   .80\r\n  1899   |    .90 |   .75\r\n  1900   |   1.10 |   .80\r\n  1901   |   1.80 |  1.10\r\n  1902   |   4.75 |  1.70\r\n  1903   |   4.75 |  2.20\r\n  1904   |   3.75 |  2.65\r\n  1905[9]|   3.45 |  2.25\r\n  ———————+————————+———————\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good prices of the past few years have caused many farmers to look\r\nagain to peppermint as a profitable crop, as noted in increased areas\r\nunder cultivation in many localities. This is the case not only in\r\nMichigan and Indiana, but also in New York, where for many years the\r\npeppermint industry has been declining. Thus, if favorable conditions\r\nof growth prevail, an increased production may be looked for within the\r\nnext few years, which will have the effect of again depressing prices.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with other products the prices of which are subject to\r\ngreat fluctuations, the condition of the market for peppermint oil\r\nneeds to be closely observed. The cost of cultivation per acre has been\r\nstated at from $12 to $14, and, with a charge of 25 cents per pound of\r\noil for distillation, the market price may easily fall below the cost\r\nof production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] From Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter, September 18, 1905, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[9] To September 16.",
