The value of certain chemical compounds\r\nas artificial manures is fully recognised, yet many attempts are being\r\nmade to prove the value of other substances for the same purpose, with\r\na view to increase in efficiency and decrease in cost. The interest in\r\nthe matter is naturally great, and agriculturists, botanists and chemists\r\nhave all approached the question from their different standpoints. In the\r\nfollowing pages an attempt is made to correlate the work that has been\r\ndone on a few inorganic substances which gave promise of proving useful\r\nin agricultural practice. Much of the evidence put forward by different\r\nworkers is conflicting, and it is clear that no definite conclusions can\r\nyet be reached. Nevertheless, examination of the evidence justifies the\r\nhope that results of practical value will yet be obtained, and it is hoped\r\nthat the analysis and coordination of the available data put forward in\r\nthis book will aid in clearing the ground for those investigators who\r\nare following up the problem from both the academic and the practical\r\nstandpoints.\r\n\r\n                                                          W.

All kinds of\r\ntheories, both probable and improbable, have been held as to the way in\r\nwhich plants obtain the various components of their foods. But quite early\r\nin the history of the subject it was acknowledged that the soil was the\r\nsource of the mineral constituents of the plant food, and that the roots\r\nwere the organs by which they were received into the plant.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in the history of science was begun when Liebig in 1840\r\nfirst discussed the importance of inorganic or mineral substances in plant\r\nnutrition. This discussion led to a vast amount of work dealing with the\r\nproblem of nutrition from many points of view, and the general result\r\nhas been the sorting out of the elements into three groups, nutritive,\r\nindifferent, and toxic. Thus calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium\r\nare classed as nutritive, arsenic, copper and boron as toxic, and many\r\nothers are regarded as indifferent.\r\n\r\nCloser examination, however, shows that this division into three classes\r\nis too rigid. Now that experiments are more refined it has become evident\r\nthat no such simple grouping is possible. It has been found that typical\r\nnutrient salts are toxic when they are applied singly to the plant in\r\ncertain concentrations, the toxic power decreasing and the nutritive\r\nfunction coming into play more fully on the addition of other nutrient\r\nsalts. For instance, Burlingham found that the typical nutrient magnesium\r\nsulphate in concentrations above _m_/8192 (_m_ = molecular weight) is\r\ntoxic to most seedlings, the degree of toxicity varying with the type\r\nof seedling and the conditions under which growth takes place. It will\r\nbe shown in the following pages that even such a typical poison as\r\nboric acid may, under suitable conditions, increase plant growth just\r\nas if it were a nutrient. A review of the whole subject leads one to\r\nconclude that in general both favourable and unfavourable conditions of\r\nnutrition are present side by side, and only when a balance is struck\r\nin favour of the good conditions can satisfactory growth take place. As\r\nindicated above, experiments have shown that the very substances that are\r\nessential for plant food may be, in reality, poisonous in their action,\r\nexercising a decidedly depressing or toxic influence on the plant when\r\nthey are presented singly to the roots. This toxic action of food salts\r\nis decreased when they are mixed together, so that the addition of one\r\ntoxic food solution to another produces a mixture which is less toxic than\r\neither of its constituents. Consequently a balanced solution can be made\r\nin which the toxic effects of the various foods for a particular plant\r\nare reduced to a minimum, enabling optimum growth to take place. Such\r\na mixture of plant foods occurs in the soil, the composition of course\r\nvarying with the soil.\r\n\r\nWhile the earliest observations set forth the poisonous action of various\r\nsubstances upon plants, it was not long before investigators found\r\nthat under certain conditions these very substances seemed to exert a\r\nbeneficial rather than an injurious action. The poisons were therefore\r\nsaid to act as “stimulants” when they were presented to the plant in\r\nsufficiently great dilution. This stimulation was noticed with various\r\nplants and with several poisons, and a hypothesis was brought forward that\r\nattempted to reconcile the new facts with the old conceptions. Any poison,\r\nit was suggested, might act as a stimulant, if given in sufficiently small\r\ndoses. It will be seen in the following pages that this is not universally\r\ntrue, such substances as copper, zinc, and arsenic failing to stimulate\r\ncertain plants even in the most minute quantities so far tested.\r\n\r\nOf recent years investigators in animal physiology have brought into\r\nprominence the striking effect of minute quantities of certain substances\r\nin animal nutrition, as for example iodine in the thyroid gland (see\r\nE. Baumann, 1895). This and other work has rendered it imperative to\r\nre-examine the parallel problems in plant physiology.\r\n\r\nThe words “stimulant” and “stimulation” themselves need more precise\r\ndefinition. As a matter of fact the “stimulation” noticed by one observer\r\nis not necessarily held to be such by another. Stimulation may express\r\nitself in various ways--the green weight and the general appearance of\r\nthe fresh plant may be improved, the dry weight may be increased, the\r\ntranspiration current may be hurried up, entailing increased absorption\r\nof water and food substances by the roots, assimilation processes may be\r\nencouraged. But these benefits are not of necessity correlated with one\r\nanother, e.g. a plant treated with a dilute solution of poison may look\r\nmuch healthier and weigh far more in the green state than an untreated\r\nplant, whereas the latter may prove the heavier in the dry state. To a\r\nmarket gardener to whom size and appearance is so important, stimulation\r\nmeans an improvement in his cabbages and lettuces in the green state, even\r\nthough the increased weight is chiefly due to additional water absorbed\r\nunder the encouragement of the stimulative agent, whereas to a scientific\r\nobserver, the dry weight may give a more accurate estimate of stimulation\r\nin that it expresses more fully an increased activity in the vital\r\nfunctions of the plant whereby the nutritive and assimilative processes\r\nhave gone on more rapidly, with a consequent increase in the deposition\r\nof tissue.\r\n\r\nWhile stimulation expresses itself in the ways detailed above poisoning\r\naction also makes itself visible to the eye. Badly poisoned plants\r\neither fail to grow at all or else make very little or weak growth. Even\r\nwhen less badly affected the toxic action is well shown in some cases\r\nby the flaccidity of the roots, and in others by the formation of a\r\n“strangulation” near the crown of the root, which spreads to the stem,\r\nmaking it into a thin thread, while the leaves usually wither and die. If\r\nsuch plants as peas are able to make any shoot growth at all the roots\r\nshow signs of a desperate attempt to put forth laterals. The primary\r\nroot gets much thickened and then bursts down four sides, the tips of the\r\nlaterals all trying to force their way through in a bunch, but failing to\r\ndo so on coming in contact with the poison. Most curious malformations\r\nof the root arise from this strong effort of the plant to fight against\r\nadverse circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile all the inorganic substances examined in this monograph are\r\ntoxic in high concentrations, some lead to increased growth in lower\r\nconcentrations, while others apparently have no effect. In this sense all\r\nsubstances could be classed as toxins, even the nutrients. Thus the old\r\ndistinction between toxin and nutrient has now lost its sharpness, but\r\nit does not lose all its significance. The old “nutrients” had certain\r\ndefinite characters in common, in that they were essential to plant\r\ngrowth, the growth being in a great degree proportional to the supply,\r\na relatively large amount of the nutrients being not only tolerated but\r\nnecessary. The substances dealt with more particularly in this book have\r\nnone of these characters. Even those that cause increased growth do not\r\nappear to be essential, at any rate not in the quantities that potassium,\r\nphosphorus, nitrogen, &c., are essential, while there is no evidence that\r\ngrowth is proportional to supply. The substances fall into two groups:\r\n\r\n(1) Those that apparently become indifferent in high dilutions and never\r\nproduce any increase in plant growth.\r\n\r\n(2) Those that cause a small, but quite distinct, increased growth when\r\napplied in quantities sufficiently small.\r\n\r\nThe former group may be legitimately regarded as toxins; the latter\r\npresent more difficulty and even now their function is not settled. It\r\nis not clear whether they stimulate the protoplasm or in some way hasten\r\nthe metabolic processes in the plant, whether they help the roots in\r\ntheir absorbent work, or whether they are simple nutrients needed only\r\nin infinitesimal quantities. The two groups, however, cannot be sharply\r\nseparated from one another. Indeed a substance may be put into one of\r\nthese classes on the basis of experiments made with one plant alone and\r\ninto another when a different plant is used, while it is quite conceivable\r\nthat further experiments with other plants may abolish the division\r\nbetween the two groups altogether. It is even impossible to speak rigidly\r\nof toxicity. The addition of the inorganic food salts to solutions of a\r\npoison reduces the toxicity of the latter, so that the plant makes good\r\ngrowth in the presence of far more poison than it can withstand in the\r\nabsence of the nutrients. This masking effect of the inorganic food salts\r\nupon the toxicity of inorganic plant poisons is paralleled by a similar\r\naction on organic toxic agents. Schreiner and Reed (1908) found that the\r\naddition of a second solute to a solution decreases the toxicity of that\r\nsolution; further the plant itself may exercise a modifying influence upon\r\nthe toxic agent. Water culture experiments were made upon the toxicity\r\nof certain organic compounds, with and without the addition of other\r\ninorganic salts. Arbutin, vanillin, and cumarin were definitely toxic and\r\nthe toxicity decidedly fell off after the addition of sodium nitrate and\r\ncalcium carbonate, especially with the weaker solutions of the toxins.\r\nCuriously enough, while weaker solutions of vanillin alone produced\r\nstimulation, the stimulating effect of this toxic agent disappeared\r\nentirely on the addition of the inorganic substances. The results showed\r\nthat the addition of certain inorganic salts to solutions of toxic organic\r\ncompounds was decidedly beneficial to the plant.\r\n\r\nAnother important problem has come to the front with regard to these\r\ntoxic substances--How do these substances get into the plant? Are they\r\nall absorbed if they occur in the soil, or is there any discriminatory\r\npower on the part of the root? In other words, do the roots perforce take\r\nin everything that is presented to their surfaces, or have they the power\r\nof making a selection, absorbing the useful and rejecting the useless and\r\nharmful?\r\n\r\nDaubeny (1833) described experiments in which various plants, as radish,\r\ncabbage, _Vicia Faba_, hemp and barley were grown actually on sulphate\r\nof strontium or on soils watered with nitrate of strontium. No strontium\r\ncould be detected in the ash of any of the plants save barley, and then\r\nonly the merest trace was found. Daubeny concluded that the roots _were_\r\nable to reject strontium even when presented in the form of a solution.\r\n“Upon the whole, then, I see nothing, so far as experiments have yet\r\ngone, to invalidate the conclusion ... that the roots of plants do, to a\r\ncertain extent at least, possess a power of selection, and that the earthy\r\nconstituents which form the basis of their solid parts are determined as\r\nto _quality_ by some primary law of nature, although their _amount_ may\r\ndepend upon the more or less abundant supply of the principles presented\r\nto them from without.” Some years after, in 1862, Daubeny reverted to\r\nthe idea, stating “I should be inclined to infer that the spongioles of\r\nthe roots have residing in them some specific power of excluding those\r\nconstituents of the soil that are abnormal and, therefore, unsuitable\r\nto the plant, but that they take up those which are normal in any\r\nproportions in which they may chance to present themselves[1].” This,\r\nhowever, was not held to apply to such corrosive substances as copper\r\nsulphate. De Saussure had found that _Polygonum Persecaria_ took up copper\r\nsulphate in large quantities, a circumstance which he attributed to the\r\npoisonous and corrosive quality of this substance, owing to which the\r\ntexture of the cells became disorganised and the entrance of the solution\r\ninto the vegetable texture took place as freely, perhaps, as if the plants\r\nhad been actually severed asunder[2]. Daubeny concluded that a plant is\r\nunable to exclude poisons of a corrosive nature, as this quality of the\r\nsubstance destroys the vitality of the absorbing surface of the roots and\r\nthus reduces it to the condition of a simple membrane which by endosmosis\r\nabsorbs whatever is presented to its external surfaces, so that whenever\r\nabnormal substances are taken up by a living plant it is in consequence\r\nof some interference with the vital functions of the roots caused in the\r\nfirst instance by the deleterious influence of the agent employed.\r\n\r\n    [1] This idea of a selectivity of the roots has been recently\r\n    revived by Colin and Lavison (1910) who found that when peas\r\n    were grown in the presence of barium, strontium or calcium\r\n    salts no trace of barium could be found in the stem, strontium\r\n    only occurred in small quantities, while calcium was present in\r\n    abundance. They concluded that apparently salts of the two latter\r\n    alkaline metals could be absorbed by the roots and transferred\r\n    to the stem and other organs, but that this is not the case with\r\n    salts of barium. They obtained similar results with other plants,\r\n    beans, lentils, lupins, maize, wheat, hyacinth. Their proof is\r\n    not rigid, and exception could be taken to it on chemical grounds.\r\n\r\n    [2] Vide Daubeny, _Journ. Chem. Soc._ (1862), p. 210.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the enormous amount of work that has been done on this subject\r\nof toxic action and stimulation it is yet too early to discuss the matter\r\nin any real detail. A voluminous literature has arisen around the subject,\r\nand in the present discussion some selection has been made with a view\r\nto presenting ascertained facts as succinctly as possible. No attempt\r\nhas been made to notice all the papers; many have been omitted perforce;\r\nit would have been impossible to deal with the matter within reasonable\r\nlength otherwise. A full and complete account would have demanded a\r\nponderous treatise. This widespread interest on the part of investigators\r\nis fully justified, as the problems under discussion are not only of\r\nthe highest possible interest to the plant physiologist, but hold out\r\nconsiderable promise for the practical agriculturist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF WORKING\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DISCUSSION OF METHODS.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the scattered investigations on plant poisons and\r\nstimulants, various experimental methods have been brought into use,\r\nbut these all fall into the two main categories of water and soil\r\ncultures, with the exception of a few sand cultures which hold a kind of\r\nintermediate position, combining certain characteristics of each of the\r\nmain groups.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of plant life appertaining to soil and water cultures are\r\ntotally different, so different that it is impossible to assume that a\r\nresult obtained by one of the experimental methods must of necessity hold\r\ngood in respect of the other method. A certain similarity does exist, and\r\nwhere parallel investigations have been carried out this becomes evident,\r\nbut it seems to be more or less individual, the plant, the poison and the\r\ncultural conditions each playing a part in determining the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Water cultures._\r\n\r\nThis method of cultivation represents the simplest type of experiment.\r\nIts great advantage is that the investigator has absolute control over\r\nall the experimental conditions. Nutritive salts and toxic substances\r\ncan be supplied in exact quantities and do not suffer loss or change\r\nby interaction with other substances which are beyond control. Any\r\nprecipitates which may form in the food solution are contained within\r\nthe culture vessel and are available for use if needed. The results are\r\nthus most useful as aids in interpreting the meaning of those from the\r\nfield experiments, the results of the one method frequently dovetailing\r\nin with those of the other in a remarkable way. The disadvantage of the\r\nwater culture method is that it is more or less unnatural, as the roots\r\nof the plants are grown in a medium quite unlike that which they meet in\r\nnature, a liquid medium replacing the solid one, so that the roots have\r\nfree access to every part of the substratum without meeting any opposition\r\nto their spread until the walls of the culture vessel are reached. The\r\nconditions of aeration are also different, for while the plant roots meet\r\nwith gaseous air in the interstices of the soil, in water cultures they\r\nare dependent upon the air dissolved in the solution, so that respiration\r\ntakes place under unusual conditions. It is possible that the poverty\r\nof the air supply can be overcome by regular aeration of the solution,\r\nresulting in decided improvement in growth, as L. M. Underwood (1913) has\r\nshown in recent work on barley in which continued aeration was carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Sand cultures._\r\n\r\nThis method has the advantage over water cultures in that the environment\r\nof the plant roots is somewhat more natural, but on the other hand\r\nthe work is cumbersome and costly, while the conditions of nutrition,\r\nwatering, &c., are less under control than in the water cultures. Sand\r\ncultures represent an attempt to combine the advantages of both soil and\r\nwater cultures, without their respective disadvantages. Generally speaking\r\nperfectly clean sand is used varying in coarseness in different tests, and\r\nthis is impregnated with nutritive solutions suitable for plant growth.\r\nThe sand is practically insoluble and sets up no chemical interaction with\r\nthe nutritive compounds, while it provides a medium for the growth of the\r\nplant roots which approximates somewhat to a natural soil. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that a certain amount of adsorption or withdrawal from solution\r\noccurs, whereby a certain proportion of the food salts are affiliated,\r\nso to speak, to the sand particles and are so held that they are removed\r\nfrom the nutritive solution in the interspaces and are not available for\r\nplant food, the nutritive solution being thus weakened. The same remark\r\napplies to the poisons that are added, so that the concentration of the\r\ntoxic substance used in the experiment does not necessarily indicate the\r\nconcentration in which it is presented to the plant roots. On the other\r\nhand, undue concentration of the solution is apt to occur on account of\r\nthe excessive evaporation from the surface of the sand. The sand particles\r\nare relatively so coarse in comparison with soil particles that the water\r\nis held loosely and so is easily lost by evaporation, thus concentrating\r\nthe solution at the surface, a condition that does not apply in soil work.\r\nWith care this disadvantage is easily overcome as it is possible to weigh\r\nthe pots regularly and to make up the evaporation loss by the addition of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Soil cultures in pots._\r\n\r\nIn this case the conditions of life are still more natural, as the plant\r\nroots find themselves in their normal medium of soil. But the investigator\r\nhas now far less control, and bacterial and other actions come into play,\r\nwhile the nutrients and poisons supplied may set up interactions with\r\nthe soil which it is impossible to fathom. This method is useful in the\r\nlaboratory as it is more convenient for handling and gives more exact\r\nquantitative results than plot experiments. Also the pots can be protected\r\nfrom many of the untoward experiences that are likely to befall the crops\r\nin the open field. The conditions are somewhat more artificial, as the\r\nroot systems are confined and the drainage is not natural, but on the\r\nwhole the results of pot experiments are very closely allied to those\r\nobtained in the field by similar tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Field experiments._\r\n\r\nThese make a direct appeal to the practical man, but of the scientific\r\nmethods employed the field experiments are the least under control. The\r\nplants are grown under the most natural conditions of cultivation it\r\nis possible to obtain, and for that reason much value has been attached\r\nto such tests. Certainly, so far as the final practical application is\r\nconcerned, open field experiments are the only ones which give information\r\nof the kind required. But from the scientific point of view one very\r\ngreat drawback exists in the lack of control that the investigator has\r\nover the conditions of experiment. The seeds, application of poison, &c.,\r\ncan all be regulated to a nicety, but the constitution of the soil itself\r\nand the soil conditions of moisture, temperature and aeration introduce\r\nfactors which are highly variable. No one can have any idea of the\r\ncomposition of the soil even in a single field, as it may vary, sometimes\r\nvery considerably, at every step. Further, no one knows the complicated\r\naction that may or may not occur in the soil on the addition of extraneous\r\nsubstances such as manures or poisons. Altogether, one is working quite\r\nin the dark as to knowledge of what is going on round the plant roots. It\r\nis impossible to attribute the results obtained to the direct action of\r\nthe poison applied. While the influence may be direct, it may also happen\r\nthat certain chemical and physical interactions of soil and poison occur,\r\nand that the action on the plant is secondary and not primary, so that\r\na deleterious or beneficial result is not necessarily due to the action\r\nof the toxic or stimulating substance directly on the plant, but it may\r\nbe an indirect effect induced possibly by an increase or decrease in the\r\navailable plant food, or to some other physiological factor. Consequently\r\ngreat care is needed in interpreting the results of field experiments\r\nwithout the due consideration of those obtained by other methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DETAILS OF METHODS.\r\n\r\nMany details of the sand and soil culture methods have been published\r\nby various investigators, e.g. Hiltner gives accounts of sand cultures,\r\nwhile the various publications issued from Rothamsted deal largely with\r\nthe soil experiments. As this is the case, and as all crucial experiments\r\nhave always been and must always be done in water cultures, it is only\r\nnecessary to give here full details of these.\r\n\r\nThe great essential for success in water culture work is _strict attention\r\nto detail_. Cleanliness of apparatus and purity of reagents are absolutely\r\nindispensable, as the failure of a set of cultures can often be traced\r\nto a slight irregularity in one of these two directions. Purity of\r\ndistilled water is perhaps the greatest essential of all. Plant roots are\r\nextraordinarily sensitive to the presence of small traces of deleterious\r\nmatter in the distilled water, especially when they are grown in the\r\nabsence of food salts. Ordinary commercial distilled water is generally\r\nuseless as the steam frequently passes through tubes and chambers which\r\nget incrusted with various impurities, metallic and otherwise, of which\r\nslight traces get into the distilled water. Loew (1891) showed that\r\nwater which contained slight traces of copper, lead or zinc derived from\r\ndistilling apparatus exercised a toxic influence which was not evident\r\nin glass distilled water. This poisonous effect was removed by filtering\r\nthrough carbon dust or flowers of sulphur. Apparently only about the\r\nfirst 25 litres of distilled water were toxic, in the later distillate\r\nthe deleterious substance was not evident.\r\n\r\nThe best water to use is that distilled in a jena glass still, the steam\r\nbeing passed through a jena glass condenser. For work on a large scale,\r\nhowever, it is impossible to get a sufficient supply of such water, while\r\nthe danger of breakage is very great. Experiments at Rothamsted were made\r\nto find a metallic still that would supply pure water. While silver salts\r\nare very injurious to plant growth it was found that water that had been\r\nin contact with _pure_ metallic silver had no harmful action. Consequently\r\na still was constructed in which the cooling dome and the gutters were\r\nmade of pure silver without any alloy, so placed that the steam impinged\r\nupon the silver dome, condensed into the silver gutter and was carried\r\noff by a glass tube into the receptacle. Such water proved perfectly\r\nsatisfactory so long as any necessary repairs to the still were made\r\nwith pure silver, but a toxic action set in directly ordinary solder was\r\nemployed. More recently a new tinned copper still has been employed with\r\ngood results, but this is somewhat dangerous for general purposes, as in\r\nthe event of the tin wearing off in any place, copper poisoning sets in\r\nat once. The water is always filtered through a good layer of charcoal as\r\na final precaution against impurity.\r\n\r\nIn the Rothamsted experiments no attempt is made to carry on the cultures\r\nunder sterile conditions. Bottles of 600 c.c. capacity are used, after\r\nbeing thoroughly cleaned by prolonged boiling (about four hours) followed\r\nby washing and rinsing. The bottles are filled with nutritive solution\r\nand the appropriate dose of poison, carefully labelled and covered with\r\nthick brown paper coats to exclude the light from the roots and to prevent\r\nthe growth of unicellular green algae. The corks to fit the bottles are\r\neither used brand new or, if old, are sterilised in the autoclave to\r\navoid any germ contamination from previous experiments. Lack of care in\r\nthis respect leads to diseased conditions due to the growth of fungi and\r\nharmful bacteria. Two holes are bored in each cork, one to admit air, the\r\nother to hold the plant, and the cork is cut into two pieces through the\r\nlatter hole.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the experimental plants are “graded,” weighed so that they\r\nonly vary within certain limits, e.g. barley may be ·05–·06 gm., peas\r\n·3–·35 gm., buckwheat ·02–·03 gm. In this way a more uniform crop is\r\nobtained. Great care is needed in selecting the seeds, the purest strain\r\npossible being obtained in each case. With barley it has always proved\r\npossible to get a pure pedigree strain, originally raised from a single\r\near. In this way much of the difficulty due to the great individuality\r\nof the plants is overcome, though that is a factor that must always be\r\nrecognised and reckoned with. The seeds are sown in damp sawdust--clean\r\ndeal sawdust, sifted and mixed up with water into a nice crumbly mass--and\r\nas soon as they have germinated and the plantlets are big enough to handle\r\nthey are put into the culture solutions. Barley plants are inserted\r\nin the corks with the aid of a little cotton wool (non-absorbent) to\r\nsupport them, care being taken to keep the seed above the level of\r\nthe water, though it is below the cork. With peas it is impossible to\r\nget a satisfactory crop if the seed is below the cork, as the plant is\r\nvery prone to bacterial and fungal infection in its early stages, and\r\ndamp cotyledons are fatal for this reason. Consequently the mouths of\r\nthe bottles are covered with stout cartridge paper, the pea root being\r\ninserted through a hole in the paper, so that the root is in the liquid\r\nwhile the cotyledons rest on the surface. As soon as sufficient growth\r\nhas been made the papers are replaced by corks, the remnants of the seeds\r\nstill being kept on top in the air. Other plants are treated according to\r\ntheir individual needs and mode of germination (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Diagrammatic sketches showing methods of setting\r\nup water cultures.\r\n\r\n    ~A.~ _a._ Seedling of cereal.\r\n         _b._ Cork bored with two holes, and cut into two pieces\r\n                through one hole.\r\n         _c._ Food solution.\r\n\r\n    ~B.~ _a._ Pea seedling.\r\n         _b._ Paper shield which supports the seedling.\r\n         _c._ Brown paper cover over bottle of food solution.]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the nutritive solution is important, and it is\r\nbecoming more and more evident that different plants have different optima\r\nin this respect. For several years a solution of medium strength was used,\r\ncontaining the following:\r\n\r\n    Potassium nitrate                   1·0 gram\r\n    Magnesium sulphate                   ·5  „\r\n    Sodium chloride                      ·5  „\r\n    Calcium sulphate                     ·5  „\r\n    Potassium di-hydrogen phosphate      ·5  „\r\n    Ferric chloride                      ·04 „\r\n    Distilled water                      to make up 1 litre.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent solution for barley plants, giving good and healthy\r\ngrowth. While peas grew very well in it, they showed some slight signs\r\nof over-nutrition. A weaker solution is being tested which gives very\r\ngood results. Peas grow very strongly in it and it also seems to be\r\nsufficiently concentrated to allow barley to carry on its growth long\r\nenough for the purposes of experiment. The solution is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Sodium nitrate                       ·5 gram\r\n    Potassium nitrate                    ·2  „\r\n    Potassium di-hydrogen phosphate      ·1  „\r\n    Calcium sulphate                     ·1  „\r\n    Magnesium sulphate                   ·1  „\r\n    Sodium chloride                      ·1  „\r\n    Ferric chloride                      ·04 „\r\n    Distilled water                      to make up 1 litre.\r\n\r\nThe latter solution was made up so that the quantity of phosphoric acid\r\nand potash approximated more or less to the amount of those substances\r\nfound by analysis in an extract made from a good soil.\r\n\r\nThe experiments are usually carried on for periods varying from 4–10\r\nweeks, six weeks being the average time. Careful notes are made during\r\ngrowth and eventually the plants are removed from the solutions, the roots\r\nare washed in clean water to remove adherent food salts, and then the\r\nplants are dried and weighed either separately or in sets. In order to\r\nreduce the error due to the individuality of the plants, five, ten or even\r\ntwenty similar sets are grown in each experimental series, the mean dry\r\nweight being taken finally. Also the same experiment is repeated several\r\ntimes before any definite conclusions are drawn.\r\n\r\nAnother method of water cultures is used by some investigators, in which\r\nthe experiments only last for a few hours or days, usually 24–48 hours.\r\nWhile such experiments may not be without value for determining the\r\nbroader outlines of toxic poisoning, they fail to show the finer details.\r\nThe effect of certain strengths of poison is not always immediate. Too\r\ngreat concentrations kill the plant at once, too weak solutions fail\r\nto have any appreciable immediate action and so appear indifferent.\r\nBetween the two extremes there exists a range of concentrations of which\r\nthe effect varies with the plant’s growth. A solution may be of such a\r\nnature and strength that at first growth is seriously checked, though\r\nlater on some recovery may be made, while it is also possible that a\r\nconcentration which is apparently indifferent at first may prove more\r\nor less toxic or stimulant at a later date, according to circumstances.\r\nConsequently too much stress must not be laid upon the results of the\r\nshort time experiments with regard to the ultimate effect of a poison upon\r\na particular plant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn examination of the various experimental methods shows that while no\r\none of them is ideal, yet each of them has a definite contribution to make\r\nto the investigation of toxic and stimulant substances. Each method aids\r\nin the elucidation of the problem from a different standpoint, and the\r\ncombination of the results obtained gives one a clearer picture of the\r\ntruth than could be obtained by one method alone. Water cultures, with\r\ntheir exactitude of quantitative control lead on by way of sand cultures\r\nto pot cultures, and these to field experiments in which the control is\r\nlargely lost, but in which the practical application is brought to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF COPPER COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF COPPER IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\nCopper has been recognised as a normal constituent of certain plants\r\nfor at least a century, so much so that in 1816 Meissner brought out\r\na paper dealing solely with the copper content of various plant ashes.\r\nThe ash of _Cardamomum minus_, of the root of _Curcuma longa_, and of\r\n“Paradieskörner[3],” amongst others, were tested and all yielded copper\r\nin very small quantity. Meissner was led to conclude that copper is\r\nwidespread in the vegetable kingdom, but that it exists in such minute\r\ntraces that its determination in plants is exceedingly difficult. In 1821\r\nPhillips made an interesting observation as to the effect of copper on\r\nvegetation. Some oxide of copper was accidentally put near the roots of a\r\nyoung poplar, and soon after the plant began to fail. The lower branches\r\ndied off first, but the harm gradually spread to the topmost leaves. As\r\na proof that copper had been absorbed by the plant the record tells that\r\nthe blade of a knife with which a branch was severed was covered with a\r\nfilm of copper where it had been through the branch, and the death of the\r\nplant was attributed to the absorbed copper.\r\n\r\n    [3] These are “grains of Paradise,” Guinea grains, or meleguetta\r\n    pepper. They are the seeds of _Amomum melegueta_ and _A.\r\n    Granum-Paradisi_, N.O. Zingiberaceae.\r\n\r\nAfter this preliminary breaking of the ground little more seems to have\r\nbeen done for some sixty years, but from about 1880 till the present day\r\nthe association of copper with the vegetable kingdom has been actively\r\ninvestigated in its many aspects. Dieulafait (1880) showed that the\r\nquantity of copper present in the vegetation is largely determined by the\r\nnature of the soil, which thus affects the ease with which the element can\r\nbe detected and estimated. Copper was shown to exist in all plants which\r\ngrow on soils of “primary origin” (“roches de la formation primordiale”),\r\nthe proportion being sufficient to enable it to be recognised with\r\ncertainty in one gram of ash, even by means of the ammonia reaction.\r\nSamples of white oak from the clay soils, and plants from the dolomitic\r\nhorizons also gave evidence of copper in one gram of ash, though less\r\nwas present than in the first case considered, but with plants grown on\r\nrelatively pure chalk 100 grams of ash had to be examined before copper\r\ncould be recognised with certainty.\r\n\r\nE. O. von Lippman found traces of copper in beets, beet leaves, and beet\r\nproducts; Passerini estimated as much as ·082% copper in the stem of\r\nchickpea plants, though he regarded this figure as too high; Hattensaur\r\ndetermined ·266% CuO in the total ash of _Molinia cærulea_ (·006% of total\r\nplant, air-dried).\r\n\r\nAfter this Lehmann (1895, 1896) carried out more exhaustive studies on\r\nthe subject of detecting and estimating the copper in various articles\r\nof food: wheat, rye, barley, oats, maize, buckwheat, and also in various\r\nmakes of bread; potatoes, beans, linseed, salads, apricots and pears;\r\ncocoa and chocolate. He found that only in those plants which are grown\r\non soil rich in copper does the copper reach any considerable value, a\r\nvalue which lies far above the quantity present in an ordinary soil.\r\nPlants from the former soils contained as much as 83–560 mg. Cu in 1\r\nkilog. dry substance, whereas ordinarily the plants only contained from\r\na trace to 20 mg. Apparently the species of the plants concerned seems\r\nto be of less importance for their copper content than is the copper\r\ncontent of the soil. The deposition of copper (in wheat, buckwheat and\r\npaprika) is chiefly in the stems and leaves, little being conveyed to the\r\nfruits and seeds, so that a high content of copper in the soil does not\r\nnecessarily imply the presence of much copper in the grain and seed. The\r\nmetal is variously distributed among the tissues, the bark of the wood\r\nbeing the richest of the aerial parts in that substance. The form in which\r\nthe copper exists in the plant is uncertain and it is suggested that an\r\nalbuminous copper compound possibly exists.\r\n\r\nVedrödi (1893) tackled the problem at about the same time as Lehmann but\r\nfrom a rather different standpoint. He ratifies the statement as to the\r\nabsorption of copper by plants, and going still further he states that\r\nin some cases the percentage of copper found in the seed may be four\r\ntimes as great as that occurring in the soil on which the plants grow,\r\nquoting one instance in which the soil contained ·051% CuO and the seed\r\n·26% CuO. It is assumed that copper must play some physiological rôle in\r\nthe plant, but no explanation of this action is yet forthcoming. Lehmann\r\ncriticised Vedrödi’s figures of the copper content of certain plant ashes,\r\nand the latter replied in a further paper (1896) in which he brings most\r\ninteresting facts to light. The quantity of copper in any species of plant\r\nvaries with the individuals of that species, even when grown on the same\r\nsoil, in the same year, and under similar conditions. The copper content\r\nof certain plants is put forward as a table, the years 1894 and 1895 being\r\ncompared, and enormous differences are to be noticed in some cases. A\r\nquotation of the table will illustrate this more clearly than any amount\r\nof explanation.\r\n\r\n    _Milligrams of copper in 1 kilog. dry matter._\r\n\r\n                          1894            1895\r\n                         /    \\          /    \\\r\n      “Seeds”          min.  max.      min.  max.\r\n    Winter wheat        80   710       200   680\r\n    Summer wheat       190   630       190   230\r\n    Maize               60    90        10    30\r\n    Barley              80   120        10    70\r\n    Oats                40   190        40   200\r\n    Buckwheat          160   640       150   160\r\n    “Fisolen” (Beans)  160   320       110   150\r\n    Linseed            120   150       110   150\r\n    Peas                60   100        60   110\r\n    Soy Beans           70   100        70    80\r\n    Lupins              80   190        70   290\r\n    Mustard seed        70   130        60    70\r\n    Paprika pods       790  1350       230   400\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EFFECT OF COPPER ON THE GROWTH OF HIGHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Toxic effect._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxic action of copper compounds alone in water cultures._\r\n\r\nThe method of water cultures has been largely applied to determine the\r\nrelation of copper compounds to plants. Twenty years ago (1893) Otto\r\ndiscovered the extreme sensitiveness of plants to this poison when grown\r\nunder such conditions, as he found that growth was very soon checked in\r\nordinary distilled water which on analysis proved to contain minute traces\r\nof copper. Controls grown in tap water gave far better plants, but this\r\nsuperiority was attributed partly to the minute traces of mineral salts\r\nin the tap water, and not only to the absence of the copper which occurred\r\nin the distilled water.\r\n\r\nTests made at Rothamsted have carried this point still further. _Pisum\r\nsativum_, _Phaseolus vulgaris_, _Triticum vulgare_, _Zea japonica_,\r\n_Tropeolum Lobbianum_, sweet pea (American Queen), nasturtium, and cow\r\npea--the first three of these being the species used by Otto--were grown\r\nin (1) ordinary distilled water, which was found to contain traces of\r\ncopper, (2) glass distilled water, for about a month, till no more growth\r\nwas possible owing to the lack of nutriment. In every single case the root\r\ngrowth was checked in some degree in the ordinary distilled water, the\r\nroots seeming to the eye to be less healthy and less well developed. In\r\nPisum, Tropeolum and Zea, the shoot growth of the coppered plants appeared\r\nstronger than that of the controls, and this was borne out when the dry\r\nweights of the plants were obtained. In every other case the coppered\r\nplants were inferior, root and shoot, to those grown in the pure water.\r\nWith the first three plants it appears that while the toxic water has a\r\nbad effect on the roots, yet the growth of the shoots is increased. The\r\nidea suggests itself that this apparent stimulation is in reality the\r\nresult of a desperate struggle against adverse circumstances. The roots\r\nare the first to respond to the action of the poison, as they are in\r\nactual contact; their growth is checked, and hence the water absorption\r\nis decreased. No food is available in the water supply from the roots,\r\nso the plant is entirely dependent on the stores laid up in the seed and\r\non the carbon it can derive from the air by photo-synthesis carried on\r\nby the green leaves. The result of the root checking in these particular\r\ncases seems to be so to stimulate the shoots by some physiological action\r\nor other, that this process of photo-synthesis is hastened, more carbon\r\nbeing converted into carbo-hydrates, so that the shoot development is\r\nincreased, yielding a greater weight of dry matter. In each of the other\r\ncases observed the shoot was obviously not stimulated to increased energy\r\nby the poison, and so the whole plant fell below the normal.\r\n\r\nOther experiments showed that barley roots are peculiarly sensitive to the\r\npresence of minute traces of copper, as very little root growth took place\r\nin the copper distilled water, and root growth was also entirely checked\r\nby the presence of one part per million copper sulphate in the pure glass\r\ndistilled water. Yet again, one litre of pure distilled water was allowed\r\nto stand on a small piece of pure metallic copper foil (about 1½″ × ½″)\r\nfor an hour, and even such water exercised a very considerable retarding\r\ninfluence upon the root-growth, checking it entirely in some instances.\r\n\r\nSome years before True and Gies published their results, Coupin (1898)\r\nhad grown wheat seedlings in culture solutions with the addition of\r\ncopper salts for several days in order to find the fatal concentrations\r\nof the different compounds. Taking toxic equivalent as meaning “the\r\nminimum weight of salt, which, dissolved in 100 parts of water, kills the\r\nseedling,” the results were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                      Toxic      Containing\r\n                                    equivalent     copper\r\n\r\n  Copper bromide (CuBr₂)             ·004875      ·001387\r\n  Copper chloride (CuCl₂.2aq.)       ·005000      ·001865\r\n  Copper sulphate (CuSO₄.5aq.)       ·005555      ·001415\r\n  Copper acetate (Cu{C₂H₃O₂}₂.aq.)   ·005714      ·001820\r\n  Copper nitrate (Cu{NO₃}₂.6aq.)     ·006102      ·001312\r\n\r\nThese numbers appear to be very close, so Coupin considered that it\r\nmight be permissible to regard the differences as due to the impurities\r\nin the salts, and to the water of crystallisation which may falsify the\r\nweights, so that under these conditions one may believe that all these\r\nsalts have the same toxicity. This is considerable, and is evidently due\r\nto the copper ion, the electro-negative ion not intervening with such a\r\nfeeble dose. A recalculation of these toxic equivalents to determine the\r\nactual amount of copper present in each, gives results that are fairly\r\napproximate, but it is difficult to accept this hypothesis in view of\r\nother work in which different salts of the same poison are proved to\r\ndiffer greatly in their action on plant growth.\r\n\r\nKahlenberg and True (1896), working with _Lupinus albus_, found that the\r\nvarious copper salts, as sulphate, chloride and acetate, were similar in\r\ntheir action upon the roots. Plants placed in solutions of these salts of\r\nvarying strengths for 15–24 hours showed that in each case 1/25,600 gram\r\nmolecule killed the root, while with 1/51,200 gram molecule the root was\r\njust alive. These workers discuss their results from the standpoint of\r\nelectrolytic dissociation, and concur in the opinion that the positive\r\nions of the toxic salt are exceedingly poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe toxicity of the positive ion was again set forth by Copeland and\r\nKahlenberg (1900). Their water culture experiments were carried on in\r\nglass vessels coated internally with paraffin to avoid solution of glass,\r\nand in tests with seedlings of maize, lupins, oats and soy beans it was\r\nfound that such metals as copper, iron, zinc and arsenic were almost\r\nalways fatal to the growth of plants. As a general rule those metals whose\r\nsalts are toxic, themselves poison plants when they are present in water.\r\nThe assumption made was that the injury to plants when cultivated in the\r\npresence of pure metals depends on the tendency of the metal to go into\r\nsolution as a component of chemical compounds and on the specific toxicity\r\nof the metallic ion when in solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Masking effect caused by addition of soluble substances to\r\nsolutions of copper salts._\r\n\r\nExperiments were carried on with barley, in which the plants were grown\r\nin the various grades of distilled water indicated above, both with and\r\nwithout the addition of nutrient salts. It was found that the presence of\r\nthe nutrients exercises a very definite masking effect upon the action of\r\nthe poisonous substance, so that the deleterious properties of the toxic\r\nsubstance are materially reduced. Later work, in which known quantities\r\nof such toxic salts as copper sulphate were added to pure distilled water\r\nshowed that in the presence of nutrient salts a plant is able to withstand\r\nthe action of a much greater concentration of poison. For instance, a\r\nconcentration of 1:1,000,000 copper sulphate alone stops all growth in\r\nbarley, but, if nutrient salts are present, a strength of 1:250,000 (at\r\nleast four times as great) does not prevent growth, though the retarding\r\naction is very considerable (Figs. 2 and 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.

In each scale of concentrations represented in the curves a\r\nconvenient intermediate strength is selected as a unit, and all other\r\nconcentrations in the series are expressed in terms of that unit. Thus,\r\nwith 1/1,000,000 as the unit a scale of concentrations might run thus:\r\n\r\n    10      1/100,000\r\n     4      1/250,000\r\n     2      1/500,000\r\n     1      1/1,000,000\r\n     0·5    1/2,000,000\r\n     0·1    1/10,000,000\r\n     0·05   1/20,000,000\r\n     0·     Control.    ]\r\n\r\nThese later Rothamsted results fit in very well with those obtained\r\nten years ago (1903) by True and Gies in their experiments on the\r\nphysiological action of some of the heavy metals in mixed solutions.\r\nPlants of _Lupinus albus_ were tested for 24–48 hours with different\r\nsolutions in which the roots were immersed. Given the same strength of\r\nthe same poison, the addition of different salts yielded varying results.\r\nFor instance, with copper chloride as the toxic agent, the addition of\r\nmagnesium chloride did not affect the toxicity, calcium chloride decreased\r\nit, while sodium chloride slightly increased the poisonous action. Calcium\r\nsulphate with copper sulphate enabled a plant to withstand four times\r\nas much copper as when the latter was used in pure solution. Calcium\r\nsalts in conjunction with those of copper proved generally to accelerate\r\nbut not to increase growth, but with silver salts they did not cause\r\nany improvement. Perhaps this amelioration is in inverse proportion to\r\nthe activity of the heavy metals. With a complex mixture consisting of\r\nfive salts--copper sulphate and salts of sodium, magnesium, calcium and\r\npotassium, all except calcium being present in concentrations strong\r\nenough to interfere with growth if used alone--it was shown that “as\r\na result of their presence together, not only is there no addition of\r\npoisonous effects, but a neutralisation of toxicity to such degree as to\r\npermit in the mixed solutions a growth-rate equal to or greater than that\r\nseen in the check culture.” If the concentration of the copper salts was\r\nincreased, the other salts remaining the same, the poisonous activity of\r\nthe copper became greater than could be neutralised by the other salts.\r\nIf the copper remained the same and the other salts were diminished by\r\nhalf (i.e. below toxic concentration) the neutralising action of the added\r\nsalts was markedly less, and the growth rate _never exceeded_ that of\r\nthe control. This was apparently due to the action of the unneutralised\r\ncopper. The indications are that the conspicuously effective part of\r\nthe molecule is the cation or metal, and that the anion plays little or\r\nno part in causing the toxicity; in such great dilutions the metals act\r\nas free ions. The hypothesis is put forward that interior physiological\r\nmodifications are responsible for the observed differences in growth\r\nrate, the cell processes being so affected as to bring about different\r\nresults on cellular growth; in other words, the growth rate represents\r\nthe physiological sum of oppositely acting stimuli or of antagonistic\r\nprotoplasmic changes where mixtures of salts occur. This is really an\r\nextension of Heald’s idea that the toxic effect of a poison is due partly\r\nto changes in the turgescence of the cell, a sudden decrease causing\r\nretardation or inhibition of growth, and partly to a direct action on\r\nthe protoplasm, which differs in different plants with the same salt.\r\nHeald (1896) went so far as to suggest that the poisonous action is a\r\nmere matter of adaptation and adjustment, since toxic substances are not\r\nusually present in soil, but this assertion is too sweeping to be accepted\r\nin its entirety, although it probably holds good to a certain extent with\r\nsome species of plants.\r\n\r\nKahlenberg and True (1896) found that the addition of an organic substance\r\nproduced the same effect as the addition of some nutrient salt, in that\r\nit reduced the toxicity of the copper salt, e.g. in the presence of sugar\r\nand potassium hydrate the lupins were able to withstand a concentration of\r\n1/400 copper sulphate, part of which reduction of toxicity is attributed\r\nto the sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Effect of adding insoluble substances to solutions of copper salts._\r\n\r\nOther investigators have shown that the presence of insoluble substances\r\nhas a similar effect in reducing toxicity to an even greater degree. True\r\nand Oglevee (1904, 1905) again used _Lupinus albus_ as a test plant in\r\nthe presence of solutions of various poisons in pure distilled water,\r\ncopper sulphate, silver nitrate, mercuric chloride, hydrochloric acid,\r\nsodium hydroxide, thymol and resorcinol all coming under consideration.\r\nClean sea sand, powdered Bohemian glass, shredded filter paper, finely\r\ndivided paraffin wax and pure unruptured starch grains were respectively\r\nadded to the solutions, and seedlings were suspended over glass rods so\r\nthat their roots were in the solutions for 24–48 hours. The solids varied\r\nin their action on the different poisons; while the toxic influence of\r\nmercuric chloride was reduced by sand and crushed glass, the action of\r\nsilver nitrate was modified by nearly all the solids. Lupin roots proved\r\nunable to withstand an exposure of 24 hours to a concentration of copper\r\nsulphate of 1 molecular weight in 60,000 litres of water (i.e. about\r\n1 part by weight CuSO₄.5H₂O in 240·4 parts water), but the addition of\r\nsolids caused a great decrease in toxicity. When the amount of copper was\r\ndiminished an advantage was regularly obtained in favour of the cultures\r\ncontaining the solid bodies. On the whole the ameliorating action of\r\nsolids is more clearly marked with dilute solutions of strong poisons than\r\nwith relatively concentrated solutions of weaker poisons. As a general\r\nrule, filter paper and potato starch grains exert a more marked modifying\r\naction than the denser bodies, such as sand, glass or paraffin.\r\n\r\nBreazeale (1906) tested the same point with extracts of certain soils\r\nwhich proved toxic to wheat seedlings grown in them as water cultures. The\r\ntoxicity was wholly or partly removed by the addition of such substances\r\nas carbon black, calcium carbonate or ferric hydrate. Other experiments\r\nshowed that the toxic substances of ordinary distilled water are removed\r\nby ferric hydrate and carbon black, and further that the latter substance\r\nwill take out copper from copper solutions, rendering them far less\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nFurther corroboration of True and Oglevee’s work was obtained by Fitch\r\n(1906) who worked in a similar way with fungi, arriving at the general\r\nconclusion that insoluble substances in a solution act as agents of\r\ndilution or absorption whereby poisonous ions or molecules are in some\r\nway removed. He found that _n_/256 of copper sulphate in beet concoction\r\nexercised a stimulating effect on _Penicillium glaucum_, but the addition\r\nof fine glass to the solution increased the stimulation, while large or\r\nmedium sized pieces did not have the same effect.\r\n\r\nThis action of solid bodies in reducing the deleterious effects of\r\npoisonous solutions is attributed to the process of “adsorption” whereby\r\na layer of greater molecular density is formed on the surfaces of solids\r\nimmersed in solutions. The solids presumably withdraw a certain proportion\r\nof poisonous ions or molecules from the body of the solution (retaining\r\nthem in a molecularly denser layer over their own surfaces), so that the\r\ntoxic properties of the solution are reduced owing to the withdrawal of\r\npart of the poison from the field of action. In some cases this reduction\r\nmay be so great as to relieve the solution of its toxic properties, or\r\neven to cause an abnormal acceleration to replace a marked retardation.\r\nAlso, if the solution is of such a dilution as to cause acceleration of\r\ngrowth in plants, the addition of insoluble substances may increase this\r\nacceleration. The progressive addition of quantities of solids causes\r\nprogressive dilution of the toxic medium, the underlying cause of these\r\nresults being the gradual removal of molecules or ions from the solutions\r\nby the insoluble body present.\r\n\r\nFitch’s results are also in accordance with the well-known fact that the\r\nphysical condition and properties of the added solid play a considerable\r\npart in determining its efficacy as an adsorbing agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Effect of copper on plant growth when present in soils._\r\n\r\nAs has already been shown the toxic property of copper with regard to\r\nplants was recognised almost as soon as that element was found to occur\r\nin the vegetable kingdom, but little notice was taken of the discovery for\r\nmany years. In 1882 F. C. Phillips asserted, as the result of experiments\r\nwith various cultivated flowering plants, including geraniums, coleas,\r\nageratum, pansies, &c., that under favourable conditions plants will\r\nabsorb small quantities of copper by their roots, and that such compounds\r\nexercise a distinctly retarding influence even if in very small amount,\r\nwhile if large quantities are present they tend to check root formation,\r\neither killing the plants outright or so far reducing their vitality\r\nas seriously to interfere with nutrition and growth. Two years later\r\nKnop confirmed both the absorption and the toxicity of copper by his\r\nexperiments on maize.\r\n\r\nJensen (1907) worked with “artificial” soils, under sterile conditions,\r\nusing finely ground quartz flour for his medium and wheat for a test\r\nplant, parallel experiments being carried on with solutions. Every\r\nprecaution was taken to ensure sterility--the corks were boiled first\r\nin water and then in paraffin, the seeds were sterilised in 2% copper\r\nsulphate solution for ¾ hour, washed in sterilised water, planted in\r\nsterilised sphagnum, the transplanting being done in a sterile chamber\r\ninto sterilised solutions. The criteria used to determine the toxic\r\nand stimulation effects were the total transpiration, average length of\r\nsprout, the green weight and dry weight of plants. The results obtained\r\nwith the different substrata showed that it does not follow that a salt\r\nhighly toxic in solution is equally so in soil, or that one which holds\r\na relatively high toxic position in soil should occupy the same relative\r\nposition in solution cultures. For instance, while in soil cultures nickel\r\ncompounds were the most toxic of all the substances tried, in solution\r\ncultures silver compounds were more poisonous than nickel. The range of\r\nconcentrations, both fatal and accelerating, was found to be much greater\r\nin solution than in soil cultures.\r\n\r\nIn the sand cultures the toxicity of the copper sulphate was found\r\nto decrease as the ratio of the quartz sand to the poisonous solution\r\nincreased, provided that a water content suitable for growth was present.\r\nJensen states that the fatal concentration of copper sulphate in solution\r\ncultures is approximately 1/10th that of the fatal concentration in his\r\nartificial soil.\r\n\r\nWhen copper salts are added to soil a complication at once sets in due\r\nto the double decomposition which is always likely to occur when any\r\nsoluble salt is added to soil. The reaction may be graphically expressed\r\nas follows, in a much simplified form--\r\n\r\n_AB_ + _CD_ = _AC_ + _BD_.\r\n\r\nHaselhoff (1892) extracted several lots of 25 kgm. soil, each with 25\r\nlitres of water in which quantities of mixed copper salts varying from\r\n0–200 mg. had been dissolved, the mixture consisting of three parts copper\r\nsulphate and one part copper nitrate. This operation was repeated 15\r\ntimes, the soils being allowed to drain thoroughly after each treatment,\r\nso that altogether each 25 kgm. soil was extracted with 375 litres water.\r\nThe drainage waters were analysed, so that the amount of copper absorbed\r\nby the soils could be estimated. It was found that by extracting with\r\nwater containing such soluble copper salts as sulphate and nitrate, the\r\nfood salts of the soil, especially those of calcium and potassium, were\r\ndissolved and washed out, copper oxide being retained by the soil. In\r\nthis way a double action was manifest, whereby the fertility of the soil\r\nwas reduced by the loss of plant food, while its toxicity was increased\r\nby the accumulation of copper oxide. So long as the soil contained a\r\ngood supply of undissolved calcium carbonate the harmful action of the\r\ncopper-containing water was diminished, but as soon as the store was\r\nexhausted by solution and leaching, the toxic influence became far more\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Mode of action of copper on plants._\r\n\r\nQuite early in the investigations on the effect of copper on plants\r\nthe question arose as to its mode of activity--whether the toxicity was\r\nmerely due to some mechanical action on the root from outside, whereby\r\nthe absorptive power of the root was impaired, or whether the poisonous\r\nsubstance was absorbed into the plant, so acting directly on the internal\r\ntissues. Gorup-Besanez made definite experiments towards ascertaining the\r\ntruth of these theories as far back as 1863, endeavouring first of all to\r\nsee whether the plants take up any appreciable quantity of poisons which\r\nexist in the soil as mixtures or combinations and which are capable of\r\nsolution by the cell-sap. Salts of arsenic, copper, lead, zinc and mercury\r\nwere intimately mixed with soil, 30 grams of the poison being added to\r\n30·7 cubic decimetres of soil, two plants separated by a partition being\r\ngrown on this quantity. The test plants were _Polygonum Fagopyrum_,\r\n_Pisum sativum_, _Secale cereale_ and _Panicum italicum_, and all the\r\nplants developed strongly and normally except the last named. The Panicum\r\ndeveloped very badly coloured leaves in an arsenic-containing soil, and\r\nthe plants were killed soon after they started in soils containing copper.\r\nAfter harvesting, the crops were analysed and no trace of copper was found\r\nin any one of the experimental plants by the methods adopted. Also the\r\nabsorption capacity of different soils for different poisons was shown\r\nto vary, for basic salts are absorbed, while acids may pass completely\r\nthrough the soil into the drainage water.\r\n\r\nThese results obtained by Gorup-Besanez are possibly not altogether above\r\ncriticism, for later workers showed that copper was absorbed to some\r\nextent by plants grown in water cultures, and if that is so it seems\r\nunlikely that no absorption should take place from soil. Nevertheless,\r\nthe absorption is very slight, for apparently living protoplasm is\r\nvery resistant to copper osmotically. Otto showed that beans, maize and\r\npeas can have their roots for a long time in a relatively concentrated\r\nsolution of copper sulphate, and yet take up very little copper indeed,\r\nbut analyses do reveal slight traces after a sufficient interval of time\r\nof contact has elapsed. Berlese and Sostegni indicate that the roots of\r\nplants grown in water culture in the presence of bicarbonate of copper\r\nshowed traces of copper.\r\n\r\nVerschaffelt (1905) devised an ingenious method of estimating the\r\ntoxic limits of plant poisons, though it is rather difficult to see\r\nhow the method can be put to practical use with water culture and soil\r\nexperiments. Living tissues increase in weight when put into water on\r\naccount of the absorption of water. Dead tissues do not, as they have\r\nlost their semi-permeable characteristics, so a decrease in weight takes\r\nplace owing to part of the water passing out. This principle is applied by\r\nVerschaffelt to determine the “mortal limit” of external agents in their\r\naction on plant tissues. Root of beetroot, potato tuber, aloe leaves,\r\nand parts of other plants rich in sugar all came under review. The parts\r\nwere cut into small pieces weighing about 3–5 grams, dried with filter\r\npaper, weighed, and plunged into solutions of copper sulphate of varying\r\nstrengths from ·001–·004 gm. mol. per litre, and left for 24 hours. After\r\ndrying and again weighing all were heavier owing to the absorption of\r\nwater. The pieces were then immersed in pure water for another period of\r\n24 hours, when after drying and weighing, those from the weaker strengths\r\nof copper sulphate (·001–·002) had absorbed yet more water, while those\r\nfrom higher concentrations (·003–·004) had lost weight. So the author\r\nassumes that for such pieces of potato the limit of toxicity lies between\r\n·002 and ·003 gm. mol. copper sulphate per litre.\r\n\r\nThese experiments may possibly give some indication as to the action\r\nof copper salts on plant roots. So long as the solution of copper\r\nsalt is dilute enough, the absorption layer of the root, acting as a\r\nsemi-permeable membrane and upheld by the resistant protoplasm, is able to\r\nkeep the copper out of the plant and to check its toxicity. As soon as a\r\ncertain limit is reached the copper exercises a corrosive influence upon\r\nthe outer layer of the root whereby its functions are impaired, so that it\r\nis no longer able efficiently to resist the entry of the poison. As the\r\nconcentration increases it is easy to conceive that the harmful action\r\nshould extend to the protoplasm itself, so that the vital activities\r\nof the plants are seriously interfered with and growth is entirely or\r\npartially checked, death ensuing in the presence of sufficiently high\r\nconcentrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Effect of copper on germination._\r\n\r\nThe action of copper on the germination of seeds, spores and pollen grains\r\nhas attracted a certain amount of attention, and although the results\r\nare apparently contradictory this is probably due to the different plant\r\norgans with which the observers have worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Seeds._\r\n\r\nMiyajima (1897) showed that the germinating power of such seeds as\r\n_Vicia Faba_, _Pisum sativum_, and _Zea Mays_ was partly destroyed by\r\na 1% solution of copper[4], _Zea Mays_ being the most resistant and\r\n_Vicia Faba_ the least resistant of the three. Micheels (1904–5) stated\r\nthat water distilled in a tinned copper vessel was more favourable for\r\ngermination than water from a non-tinned vessel. He suggests that this is\r\ndue to copper being present in the water in a colloidal form in which the\r\nparticles are exceedingly small and maintain themselves in the liquid by\r\nreason of a uniform disengagement of energy in all directions, to which\r\nenergy the influence on germinating seeds must be attributed, the nature\r\nof the suspended substance determining whether the influence be favourable\r\nor not. It is questionable, however, whether Micheels was really dealing\r\nwith a true colloidal solution of copper or with a dilute solution of\r\nsome copper salt produced by oxidation of the copper vessel from which\r\nhis distilled water was obtained.\r\n\r\n    [4] The English translation in Just’s _Bot. Jahresber._ speaks only\r\n    of a “solution of copper,” and in no case is the specific compound\r\n    mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Spores and pollen grains._\r\n\r\nMiani (1901) brought fresh ideas to bear upon the problem of the action\r\nof copper on living plant cells, in that he sought to attribute the toxic\r\nor stimulant effects to an oligodynamic action, i.e. spores and pollen\r\ngrains were grown in hanging drop cultures in pure glass distilled water\r\nwith the addition of certain salts or traces of certain metals. While the\r\nsalts are known to be often disadvantageous to germination, Nägeli had\r\nasserted that the latter often exerted an oligodynamic action. In some\r\ncases pure copper was placed for varying times in the water from which the\r\nhanging drop cultures were eventually made, or tiny bits of copper were\r\nplaced in the drop itself. Various kinds of pollen grains were tested,\r\nand as a rule, pollen was only taken from one anther in each experiment,\r\nthough occasionally it was from several anthers of the same flower. It\r\nwas generally found that the germination of pollen grains or Ustilago\r\nspores was not hindered by the use of coppered water or by the presence\r\nof small bits of copper in the culture solution. The only cases in which\r\nsome spores or pollen grains were more or less harmed were those in which\r\nthe water had stood over copper for more than two weeks, and even so the\r\ndeleterious effect was chiefly noticeable when the pollen itself was old\r\nor derived from flowers in which the anther formation was nearly at an\r\nend. As a rule germination was better in the presence of copper, whether\r\nin pure water or food solution, the stimulus being indicated both by the\r\ngreater number of germinated grains and by the regular and rapid growth\r\nof the pollen tubes. Miani attributes this favourable action to the mere\r\npresence of the copper, corroborating Nägeli’s idea of an oligodynamic\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Does copper stimulate higher plants?_\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing review it is evident that it is the toxic action\r\nof copper that is most to the front, so far as the higher plants are\r\nconcerned, and that little or no evidence of its stimulative action in\r\ngreat dilution has so far been discussed. Kanda dealt with this question,\r\nwith the deliberate intention of obtaining such evidence, if it existed.\r\nHe worked with _Pisum sativum_, var. _arvense_, _Pisum arvense_, _Vicia\r\nFaba_, var. _equine_ Pers, and _Fagopyrum esculentum_ Mönch, which were\r\ngrown in glass distilled water, without any food salts, so that the plants\r\nwere forced to live on the reserves in the seeds, which were carefully\r\ngraded to ensure uniformity of size. It was found that in water cultures\r\ncopper sulphate solutions down to ·00000249% (about 1 in 40,160,000)\r\nare harmful to peas, and still further down to ·0000000249% (about 1\r\nin 4,016,000,000) the copper salts act as a poison rather than as a\r\nstimulant. Against this, however, is the statement that in certain soils\r\ncopper sulphate acts as a stimulant when it is added in solution. Jensen\r\nagain could obtain no stimulation with copper sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted experiments go to uphold Kanda’s statements as to the\r\nfailure of copper sulphate to stimulate plants grown in water cultures.\r\nPeas are perhaps slightly more resistant to the greater strengths of\r\ncopper sulphate than are barley and buckwheat, for while 1/100,000\r\nproves mortal to the latter, peas will struggle on and fruit in 1/50,000,\r\nthough this strength is very near the limit beyond which no growth can\r\noccur (Fig. 4). As a general rule, with barley the depression caused by\r\nthe poison is still evident with 1/5,000,000 and 1/10,000,000, though\r\noccasionally these doses act as indifferent doses, no sign of stimulation\r\nappearing in any single instance. With peas again, even 1/20,000,000\r\ncopper sulphate is poisonous, although to the eye there is little to\r\nchoose between the control plants and those receiving poison up to a\r\nconcentration of one part in 2½ million (Fig. 5). In the case of buckwheat\r\nthe matter is still undecided, as in some experiments apparent stimulation\r\nis obtained with 1 in 2½ or 1 in 5 million copper sulphate, while in\r\nothers a consistent depression is evident, even when the dilution is\r\ncarried considerably below this limit. The reason for the variation with\r\nthis particular plant is so far unexplained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.

Curve showing the mean values of the dry weights\r\nof four series of pea plants grown in the presence of copper sulphate and\r\nnutrient salts. (Oct. 3rd–Dec. 20th, 1912.)]\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of all the accumulated evidence as to the consistent\r\ntoxicity of copper salts in great dilution, the possibility still\r\nremains that the limit of toxicity has not yet been reached, and that\r\na stimulating concentration does exist, so that it is still uncertain\r\nwhether beyond the limits of toxicity copper salts act as indifferent or\r\nstimulative agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Action of copper on organs other than roots._\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the work on the relations of copper with the life-processes\r\nof plants has dealt with those cases in which the metal has been supplied\r\nto the roots in some form or other, and many of the results may be\r\nsaid to apply more strictly to the theoretical, or rather to the purely\r\nscientific aspects of the matter, than to the practical everyday life\r\nof the community. This statement is hardly correct, in that the two\r\nlines of work are so inextricably interwoven that the one could not be\r\nsatisfactorily followed up without a parallel march of progress along the\r\nother. In practice, copper has proved remarkably efficient as a fungicide\r\nwhen applied as sprays in the form of Bordeaux mixture to infested plants\r\nand trees. Observations on the action of the fungicide have shown that\r\nthe physiological processes of the treated plants are also affected to\r\nsome degree, and a number of interesting theories and results have been\r\nput forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Effect of copper sprays on leaves._\r\n\r\nFrank and Krüger (1894) treated potato plants with a 2% Bordeaux mixture,\r\nand obtained a definite improvement in growth, which they attributed\r\nto the direct action of the Bordeaux mixture upon the activities of\r\nthe plant. The effect of the copper was most marked in the leaves,\r\nand was chiefly indicated by increase in physiological activity rather\r\nthan by morphological changes. The structure of the sprayed leaves was\r\nnot fundamentally changed but they were thicker and stronger in some\r\ndegree, while their life was lengthened. Apparently, treatment increased\r\nthe chlorophyll content, and, correlated with this, was a rise in the\r\nassimilatory capacity, more starch being produced. Rise in transpiration\r\nwas also observed. While the leaves were the organs most affected, a\r\nsubsidiary stimulation occurred in the tubers, since the greater quantity\r\nof starch produced required more accommodation for its storage. In\r\ndifferent varieties the ratio of tuber formation on treated and untreated\r\nplants was 19:17 and 17:16. In discussing the meaning of this stimulation\r\nthese writers, following the custom then in vogue, were inclined to\r\nhold that it was due to a catalytic rather than to a purely chemical\r\naction, an idea similar to one which later on came much into prominence\r\nin connection with the work of Bertrand’s school on manganese, boron and\r\nother substances.\r\n\r\nThe imputed increase in photo-synthesis seems to have met with approval\r\nand acceptance, but nevertheless it did not pass unchallenged. Ewert\r\n(1905) brought forward a detailed discussion and criticism of the\r\nassumption that green plants when treated with Bordeaux mixture attain a\r\nhigher assimilation activity than untreated plants. His experiments were\r\nmade to test the effects of differing conditions of life on plants treated\r\nin various ways, and his conclusions lead him to assert that “instead of\r\nthe organic life of the plant being stimulated by treatment with Bordeaux\r\nmixture it is rather hindered.”\r\n\r\nWhile Frank and Krüger indicated a rise in transpiration when copper\r\ncompounds were applied to the _leaves_ as sprays, Hattori (1901)\r\nattributed part of the toxic effect of copper salts, when applied to\r\nthe _roots_, to a weakening action on the transpiration stream, and\r\nhe maintained that the toxic effect of the copper salts is therefore\r\nconnected with the humidity of the air. No further confirmation or\r\nrefutation of this statement has so far come to light.\r\n\r\nIn certain plants the application of cupric solutions as sprays causes a\r\nslight increase in the quantity of sugar present in the matured fruits.\r\nChuard and Porchet (1902, 1903) consider that such a modification in the\r\nripe fruit during the process of maturation occurs in all plants which\r\nripen their fruits before leaf-fall begins. Injection of solutions of\r\ncopper salts into the tissues of such plants as the vine causes more\r\nvigorous growth, more intense colour and greater persistence of the\r\nleaves; in other words the copper acts as a stimulant to all the cells of\r\nthe organism. A similar effect is produced by other metals such as iron or\r\ncadmium. By injecting small quantities of cupric salts into the branches\r\nof currants an acceleration of the maturation of the fruits was caused,\r\nidentical with that obtained by the application of Bordeaux mixture to the\r\nleaves. If the quantity of copper introduced into the vegetable organism\r\nwas augmented, the toxic action of the metal began to come into play.\r\nThese investigators attributed the stimulus, as shown by the earlier\r\nmaturation of the fruits, to a greater activity of all the cells of\r\nthe organism and not to an excitation exercised only on the chlorophyll\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Effect of solutions of copper salts on leaves._\r\n\r\nTreboux (1903) demonstrated the harmful action of solutions of copper\r\nsalts on leaves by means of experiments on shoots of _Elodea canadensis_.\r\nThe activity of photo-synthesis was measured by the rate of emission\r\nof bubbles of oxygen. On placing the shoots first in water, then in\r\n_N_/1,000,000 copper sulphate (·0000159%), there was a reduction from\r\n20 to 15 or 16 bubbles in 5 minutes. On replacing in water there was\r\nan increase to 18, but not to 20, indicating a permanent injury. With\r\n_N_/10,000,000 copper sulphate there was little or no reduction in the\r\nnumber of bubbles. This experiment had an interesting side issue in that\r\nit was noticed that not only the concentration, but also the quantity\r\nof fluid was concerned in the toxic action, indicating that both the\r\nproportion and the actual amount of poison available play their part.\r\nFor instance, with a shoot 10 cm. long in 100 c.c. solution the plants\r\nwere only slightly affected by ·000015% copper sulphate, but in 500\r\nc.c. solution the shoots were killed after some days in ·0000015% copper\r\nsulphate, a concentration only one-tenth as great.\r\n\r\nWhile it is evident that copper sprays have a definite action upon\r\ngreen leaves, whether favourable or unfavourable, the question arises\r\nas to the means whereby the copper obtains access to the plant in order\r\nto take effect. Dandeno found that solutions of copper sulphate were\r\nabsorbed by the leaves of Ampelopsis, forming a brown ring. Generally\r\nspeaking inorganic salts in solution are absorbed through both surfaces\r\nof the leaves, whether the leaves are detached or not, provided the\r\nsurrounding atmospheric conditions are favourable, the absorption being\r\nusually more ready through the lower surface. Dilute solutions applied\r\nin drops stimulate the leaf tissue in a ring, whereas if the solutions\r\nare concentrated the entire area covered by the drop is affected. Too\r\nconcentrated solutions of copper sulphate applied to leaves caused\r\nscorching, but if this was avoided while the solution was still strong\r\nenough to cause a darkening of green colour after a time, Dandeno\r\nconsidered that the action was probably of the nature of a stimulus to\r\ngrowth, and produced a better development of chlorophyll and protoplasm in\r\nthe region where the tissues appeared dark to the naked eye, a conclusion\r\nwhich tallies very closely with that of Frank and Krüger.\r\n\r\nAmos (1907–8) experimented to see whether the application of Bordeaux\r\nmixture affected the assimilation of carbon dioxide by the leaves of\r\nplants, and whether any stimulation was produced. Brown and Escombe’s\r\nmethods and apparatus were used and the summarised results indicate that\r\nthe application of Bordeaux mixture to the leaves of plants diminishes\r\nthe assimilation of carbon dioxide by those leaves for a time. The\r\neffect gradually passes off, whatever the age of the leaves may be.\r\nThe suggestion is made that the stomata are blocked by the Bordeaux\r\nmixture, so that less air diffuses into the intercellular spaces and less\r\ncarbon dioxide comes into contact with the absorptive surfaces. If this\r\nhypothesis is correct, the physiological slackening of assimilation is\r\nnot due to the toxic action of the copper in the Bordeaux mixture, but to\r\na mechanical hindrance due to blocking of the stomata.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EFFECT OF COPPER ON CERTAIN OF THE LOWER PLANTS.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the lower plants, especially to some species of fungi,\r\none notices a striking contrast in their behaviour to that of the higher\r\nplants. Some species of fungi have the power of living and flourishing\r\nin the presence of relatively large quantities of copper compounds, or\r\neven of copper or bronze in the solid state. Dubois (1890) found that\r\nconcentrated solutions of copper sulphate, neutralised by ammonia, which\r\nwere used for the immersion of gelatine plates used in photography,\r\nshowed white flocculent masses resembling the mycelium of Penicillium\r\nand Aspergillus, which grew rapidly and fructified in Raulin’s solution,\r\nbut which remained as mycelium in cupric solutions. The mould proved\r\ncapable of transforming copper sulphate into malachite in the presence of\r\na piece of bronze, but it was found that the presence of the latter was\r\nnot essential for the conversion into basic carbonate. The same result\r\nwas obtained if the culture liquid was put in contact with a body which\r\nprevented it from becoming acid, fragments of marble acting in this way.\r\nCopper sulphate solution in the presence of the mould produced a _green_\r\ndeposit on the marble, while without the fungus the solution simply\r\nevaporated leaving a blue stain of copper sulphate.\r\n\r\nTrabut (1895) found that on treating smutty wheat with a 2% solution of\r\ncopper sulphate he obtained a mass of flocculent white mycelium, whose\r\nsurface was soon covered with aerial branches bearing pale rose-coloured\r\nspores, and he gave the provisional name of _Penicillium cupricum_ to the\r\nspecies. On preparing nutritive solutions by steeping a handful of wheat\r\nin water for 24 hours, and then adding various amounts of copper sulphate\r\nto them, Penicillium was found to vegetate quite well until the amount of\r\ncopper sulphate reached 9½ grams in 100 c.c., after which the seedings\r\nwith spores did not develope at all. De Seynes tested this Penicillium\r\nmore exhaustively with different culture media under various conditions\r\nand decided that Trabut was right in only assigning the name _P. cupricum_\r\nprovisionally, as the mould reverts to the form _P. glaucum_ when seeded\r\nin a natural medium, indicating that _P. cupricum_ has not an autonomous\r\nexistence, but is _P. glaucum_ which modifies the colour of its conidia\r\nunder the influence of copper sulphate, in the same way that it often\r\nmodifies them in other media. It is noticeable that the mycelium arising\r\nfrom the germination of conidia of _P. cupricum_ in a normal medium has a\r\nvery poor capacity for producing reproductive organs, but this diminished\r\nactivity is attributed not to a special deleterious action of the copper\r\nsulphate but to the impulse given to the vegetative functions, at the\r\nexpense of the reproductive, when the spores are seeded in a richer medium\r\nthan the solutions of copper sulphate which serve as the soil for _P.\r\ncupricum_.\r\n\r\nOno found that Aspergillus and Penicillium are retarded in growth in the\r\nhigher concentrations of copper sulphate, but that they are stimulated\r\nby weaker strengths. The range of stimulating concentrations is given\r\nas from ·0015%–·012%, the biggest crop being obtained with both moulds\r\nin the strongest of these solutions. Hattori gives the optimum as being\r\nconsiderably lower for the two fungi mentioned, Penicillium being at its\r\nbest in a solution of ·008% and Aspergillus in ·004%. A. Richter (1901)\r\nopposes this absolutely so far as _Aspergillus niger_ is concerned. In his\r\nexperiments copper appears invariably as a depressant, all concentrations\r\nfrom 1/150 to 1/150,000,000 giving growth below the normal, no stimulative\r\naction ever being observed. Zinc however proved to be a definite stimulant\r\nand in a mixture of copper and zinc salts in appropriate concentrations\r\nthe toxic effect of the copper was completely paralysed by the stimulating\r\naction of the zinc, 1/200,000 zinc salt paralysing or overcoming the\r\ncopper salt at 1/1125.\r\n\r\nOno states that the optimal quantity of such poisons as copper salts\r\nis lower for algae than for fungi, copper failing to stimulate algae at\r\ndilutions which were the most favourable to the growth of fungi. Bokorny\r\nindicates that silver and copper salts work harm in unusually dilute\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to utilise the poisonous action of copper on algae\r\nin clearing ponds of those plants. Lindsay (1913) describes experiments\r\ncarried on in a reservoir infested with Spirogyra. A quantity of copper\r\nsulphate sufficient to make a solution of 1/50,000,000 was found necessary\r\nto kill off the Spirogyra, but it is suggested that the solution was\r\nprobably weaker before it reached the algae, owing to the currents of\r\nfresh water. Anaboena needed 1/10,000,000 before it was killed off, while\r\nOscillatoria is less sensitive still, 1/5,000,000 usually representing\r\nthe mortal dose, though 1/4,000,000 was necessary in some instances.\r\nAlgae seem to be peculiarly sensitive to the copper sulphate, far more\r\nso than the higher plants, as _Nuphar lutea_, _Menyanthes trifoliata_,\r\nand _Polygonum amphibium_ grew in the water unharmed by the addition of\r\nthe poisonous substance. For some unexplained reason it seems that “the\r\nconcentration of copper sulphate necessary to kill off the algae in the\r\nlaboratory is five to twenty times as great as that needed to destroy the\r\nsame species in its natural habitat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nAltogether, after looking at the question from many points of view, one\r\nis forced to the conclusion that under most typical circumstances copper\r\ncompounds act as poisons to the higher plants, and that it is only under\r\nparticular and peculiar conditions and in very great dilutions that any\r\nstimulative action on their part can be clearly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF ZINC COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF ZINC IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe presence of zinc in the ash of certain plants has been recognised for\r\nmany years, especially in so far as the vegetation of soils containing\r\nmuch zinc is concerned. Risse, before 1865, stated that most plants when\r\ngrown on such soils prove to contain greater or less quantities of zinc\r\noxide. He states that the soil at Altenberg, near Aachen, is very rich\r\nin zinc, which rises as high as 20% in places. The flora of the soil\r\nis very diversified and zinc has been determined qualitatively in most\r\nand quantitatively in some of the plants. _Viola tricolor_ and _Thlaspi\r\nalpestre_ are most characteristic under such circumstances, both showing\r\nsuch constant habit changes that they resemble new species, while other\r\nplants such as _Armeria vulgaris_ and _Silene inflata_ are peculiarly\r\nluxuriant. Risse’s figures of the zinc content of these four plants may\r\nprove of interest. The figures are based on the dry weights, air dried.\r\n\r\n    _Thlaspi alpestre_, var. _calaminaria_.\r\n\r\n       Root       6·28% ash,  0·167% ZnO,   1·66% ZnO in ash.\r\n       Stem      11·75%  „    0·385%  „     3·28%  „    „\r\n       Leaves    11·45%  „    1·50%   „    13·12%  „    „\r\n       Flowers    8·49%  „    0·275%  „     3·24%  „    „\r\n\r\n    _Viola tricolor._\r\n\r\n       Root       5·59% ash,  0·085% ZnO,   1·52% ZnO in ash.\r\n       Stem      10·55%  „    0·065%  „     0·62%  „    „\r\n       Leaves     9·42%  „    0·110%  „     1·16%  „    „\r\n       Flowers    7·66%  „    0·075%  „     0·98%  „    „\r\n\r\n    _Armeria vulgaris._\r\n\r\n       Root       4·74% ash,  0·17% ZnO,    3·58% ZnO in ash.\r\n       Stem       5·37%  „    0·02%  „      0·37%  „    „\r\n       Leaves     9·36%  „    0·11%  „      1·17%  „    „\r\n       Flowers    6·08%  „    0·07%  „      1·15%  „    „\r\n\r\n    _Silene inflata._\r\n\r\n       Root       2·71% ash,  0·02% ZnO,    0·74% ZnO in ash.\r\n       Stem    }\r\n       Leaves  } 11·43%  „    0·22%  „      1·92%  „    „\r\n       Flowers }\r\n\r\nFreytag (1868) carried out various experiments on the influence of\r\nzinc oxide and its compounds on vegetation, and found that all plants\r\nare capable of absorbing zinc oxide by their roots when grown on soils\r\ncontaining such oxide. Generally speaking the zinc is deposited chiefly in\r\nthe leaves and stems, very little being found in the seeds, such minute\r\ntraces occurring that he stated that the seeds must be harmless for men\r\nand animals. The general content of ZnO in plants is given as ·5–1·0% of\r\nash, except in the abnormal case of plants growing on calamine.\r\n\r\nLechartier and Bellamy (1877) demonstrated the presence of zinc in such\r\nfood substances as wheat, American maize, barley and white haricots, but\r\nthey failed to find it in maize stems and beetroot, so they cautiously\r\nconcluded that if it does occur in the latter cases it must be far less\r\nin quantity than in the former. Hattensaur (1891) analysed the ash of\r\n_Molinia cærulea_ and discovered the presence of copper, manganese, zinc\r\nand lead, zinc oxide forming ·265% of the total ash, (·006% of the air\r\ndried plant).\r\n\r\nJensch (1894) observed that the flora on calamine soils was somewhat\r\nscanty, the chief plants that came under his notice being _Taraxacum\r\nofficinale_, _Capsella Bursa-pastoris_, _Plantago lanceolata_, _Tussilago\r\nFarfara_, and _Polygonum aviculare_, all of which showed certain\r\nmorphological peculiarities. Generally speaking the growth of these plants\r\non the calamine soils was weak and poor, the stems and leaves being very\r\nbrittle. Jensch found that the roots were deformed and showed a tendency\r\ntowards a plate-like superficial spread of root. The leaves of _Tussilago_\r\nwere uneven in shape and lacked the white hairs on the under side, the\r\nflower stalks were twisted, while the flowers themselves were a deep\r\nsaturated yellow colour. The stems of _Polygonum aviculare_ were much\r\nthickened at the nodes, the leaves weak and rolled in character, while\r\nthe flowers were long-stalked, the calyces being usually of a purple\r\nred colour. The following figures are given for the quantities of zinc\r\ncarbonate (ZnCO₃) in the ash of these two plants:--\r\n\r\n    _Tussilago Farfara._\r\n\r\n          Root          Leaf-stalk     Leaf-blade\r\n       2·51%–3·26%     1·75%–1·63%    2·90%–2·83% ZnCO₃\r\n     = 1·629%–2·115%   1·136%–1·058%  1·882%–1·836% ZnO.\r\n\r\n    _Polygonum aviculare._\r\n\r\n          Root           Stem          Leaves\r\n       1·77%–1·93%    2·25%–2·86%   1·24%–1·49% ZnCO₃\r\n     = 1·148%–1·252%  1·46%–1·856%   ·804%–·967% ZnO.\r\n\r\nOther analyses of plants from zinc soils as against controls from normal\r\nsoils indicated the high water and high ash content of the zinc plants,\r\nthough the dry matter was low, and it is suggested that the increase of\r\nthe ash may be connected with a stimulation caused by the zinc salts,\r\nunless it is due to phosphoric-acid hunger, since the calamine soils\r\nconcerned are very deficient in phosphorus.\r\n\r\nJavillier (1908 c) corroborated the early statements of Risse as to the\r\npresence of considerable quantities of zinc in certain species of _Viola_,\r\n_Thlaspi_ and _Armeria_, and also he cited a list of other plants in\r\nwhich zinc occurs in some quantity. Javillier, however, is of opinion\r\nthat zinc oxide, like the oxides of iron and manganese, is very common in\r\nplant ash, being present in all plant organs. Zinc is specially abundant\r\nin Coniferae, where it is probably characteristic, as is the presence\r\nof manganese in the ash and manno-cellulose in the wood. The so-called\r\n“calamine” plants show great powers of accommodation to large amounts of\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nKlopsch (1908) analysed 17 species of plants grown on soil in the\r\nvicinity of zinc works, and showed that the plants evidently absorb small\r\nquantities of zinc from their surroundings. He also regarded zinc as a\r\nnormal constituent of certain plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EFFECT OF ZINC ON THE GROWTH OF HIGHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Toxic effect._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxic action of zinc salts alone in water cultures._\r\n\r\nIn comparison with copper little work has been done with regard to the\r\naction of soluble zinc salts alone on higher plants when grown in water\r\ncultures. Freytag (1868) stated that zinc salts must be very dilute if the\r\nplants are not to be harmed, and that for zinc sulphate the concentrations\r\nmust not be more than 200 mg. per litre (= 1/5000). Baumann (1885) carried\r\nout further experiments and concluded that zinc salts are far more toxic\r\nthan Freytag suspected, 44 mg. zinc sulphate per litre[5] killing plants\r\nof 13 species belonging to 7 families (Coniferae excepted). The various\r\nplants withstand the action of the zinc salts in different degrees, the\r\nsame concentration killing off the species in different times. With the\r\n44 mg. zinc sulphate the following results were obtained:--\r\n\r\n    Trifolium pratense      killed in 16 days\r\n    Spergula arvensis           „     21  „\r\n    Hordeum vulgare             „     30  „\r\n    Vicia sativa                „     31  „\r\n    Polygonum Fagopyrum         „     60  „\r\n    Beta vulgaris               „     76  „\r\n    Onobrychis sativa           „    194  „\r\n\r\n    [5] 44 mg. ZnSO₄.7H₂O = 10 mg. Zn = 1/22,727 ZnSO₄.7H₂O approx.\r\n\r\nWith still less poison, 22 mg. zinc sulphate per litre, all the species\r\nmentioned were eventually killed with the exception of _Onobrychis\r\nsativa_, while 4·4 mg. zinc sulphate seemed to be harmless for all the\r\nplants tested except _Raphanus sativus_, which is evidently exceptionally\r\nsensitive to this toxic substance.\r\n\r\nJensen (1907) again indicated the poisonous action of zinc salts and also\r\nfound that a relatively small reduction of toxicity was obtained by the\r\naddition of finely divided quartz to the solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Effect of soluble zinc salts in the presence of nutrients._\r\n\r\nKrauch (1882) grew various plants in the presence of nutrient solutions\r\nand quantities of zinc sulphate varying from ·1 to ·8 gm. per litre\r\n(= 1/10,000 to 8/10,000). Barley proved to be very sensitive, even to\r\nthe weakest strength of the poison, as the plants soon showed reddish\r\nflecks, while all were dead within six weeks, the control plants without\r\nzinc remaining quite healthy. Certain grasses took longer to kill than\r\nbarley, those with ·4 gm. zinc sulphate per litre dying in about seven\r\nweeks, while 13 weeks elapsed before the others were killed. Even after\r\nthis length of time the plants with ·1 gm. zinc sulphate per litre still\r\nsurvived, although in a very sickly condition. With willow, again, even\r\n·1 gm. zinc sulphate per litre made the plants very sickly after four\r\nweeks, growth being weak, the leaves yellow, and the roots brownish. In\r\nthis case the solutions were renewed, but the plants treated with zinc\r\ncompounds were dead within eight weeks from the start, the controls being\r\nvery healthy.\r\n\r\nThe next year (1883) Storp repeated these experiments made by Krauch and\r\ncorroborated his results fully. Barley and grasses (timothy and others)\r\ngrown in solutions of zinc sulphate, both with and without nutrients, soon\r\nlost their green colour and became covered with rusty brown flecks, the\r\nbarley dying within 14 days, and the grasses soon after. With willow, too,\r\nthe toxic action was again manifested.\r\n\r\nTrue and Gies (1903) showed that the addition of calcium salts\r\nin appropriate concentrations reduced the toxicity of zinc salts\r\nconsiderably, a result similar to that which they obtained for copper.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments at Rothamsted have shown that zinc sulphate is very\r\ntoxic to barley, though the plant is able to make some slight amount of\r\ngrowth even in the presence of a solution of the anhydrous salt ZnSO₄\r\nas strong as 1/5000, rapid improvement occurring as the concentration\r\ndecreases to 1/2,500,000 or less (Fig. 6). On the whole the higher\r\nstrengths of zinc sulphate are less poisonous to peas than they are\r\nto barley. At a concentration of 1 in ¼ or 1 in ½ million in different\r\nexperiments the growth was nearly as good as with the control plants,\r\nthough it consistently lagged a little way behind until a dilution of\r\n1/10,000,000 was reached (Figs. 7 and 8). Incidentally it is very striking\r\nto see the desperate efforts that badly poisoned pea plants make to\r\nreproduce themselves. Growth of the roots is nearly always checked in\r\nadvance of that of the shoots, probably on account of the contact of the\r\nroots with the poison. In the greater strengths of such poisons as zinc\r\nand copper sulphate root growth is checked from the outset, but usually\r\na very little shoot growth is made, and one frequently obtains ridiculous\r\nlittle plants about an inch high bearing unhappy and diminutive flowers,\r\nwhich are occasionally replaced by equally unhappy and miniature fruits.\r\nThe same thing has also been noticed when unsuccessful attempts have been\r\nmade to introduce spinach as a test plant for water cultures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.

(May 18th–June 28th, 1910.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Effect of zinc compounds on plant growth when they are present in\r\nsoils._\r\n\r\nAs soon as the presence of zinc in members of the vegetable kingdom was\r\nestablished the question arose as to its effect upon both the plant and\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nGorup-Besanez (1863) grew plants in soil with which 30 grams of metallic\r\npoisons such as CuSO₄, ZnSO₄, HgO, were intimately mixed with 30·7 litres\r\n(“cubik Decimeter”) of soil[6]. On analysing the ash of _Secale cereale_,\r\n_Polygonum Fagopyrum_, and _Pisum sativum_ after six months growth he\r\nfailed to detect the presence of zinc in any one of the three. As the\r\nresults varied with different poisons on different plants he concluded\r\nthat the absorption capacity of the various kinds of soils for different\r\npoisons varies, that basic salts are absorbed, while the acid salts may\r\npass completely through the soil in the drainage water.\r\n\r\n    [6] This is equivalent to about ·1% of poison.\r\n\r\nFreytag (1868) stated that zinc is retained by the soil in the form of\r\noxide, which is derived from dilute zinc compounds as they filter through\r\nthe soil, by decomposition by the salts of the soil. For field earth the\r\nlimit of absorption of zinc oxide from zinc sulphate is between ·21%–·24%\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nF. C. Phillips (1882) corroborated Freytag’s statement as to the\r\nabsorption of small quantities of zinc by the roots of plants, but he\r\nstates as a fact that both lead and zinc may enter plant tissues without\r\ncausing any disturbance in the growth, nutrition or functions of the\r\nplants, a conclusion that is obviously incorrect or at least incomplete\r\nin view of later work on the subject. His choice of plants was certainly\r\nunusual, including geraniums, coleas, ageratums and pansies, the poison\r\nused being zinc carbonate.\r\n\r\nHoldefleiss (1883) stated that in spite of a soil content of 2% zinc\r\nthe vegetation was not in any way harmed, clover fields and meadow lands\r\non zinc soil presenting a normal appearance. This observation was quite\r\ninconclusive, as the author proceeds to say that of the plants that were\r\nable to absorb zinc salts without disadvantage the most luxuriant were\r\nthe so-called zinc plants--the exceptions that prove the rule. Two years\r\nlater Baumann showed that such insoluble zinc salts as the carbonate\r\nand sulphide in the soil cannot hurt plants. These salts are certainly\r\ndissolved to some extent by water containing CO₂ but solution is hindered\r\nby the constitution of the soil. He also found that the various kinds of\r\nsoil act differently upon zinc solutions, the absorptive power of pure\r\nhumus soils (“reinem Humusboden”) for zinc solutions being the strongest.\r\nClay and chalk soils also decompose such solutions energetically, while\r\npoor sandy soils have only a weak power of absorption. This selectivity\r\nof absorption may account for the difference in the toxicity of zinc salts\r\nto plants in the various soils.\r\n\r\nStorp (1883) experimented to determine the changes in the various\r\ncharacters of the soil by the action of zinc salts on it, and he makes the\r\nremarkable statement that in some soils the presence of zinc generates\r\nfree sulphuric acid, which is particularly injurious to plant life.\r\nGrasses, young oaks and figs showed a decrease in dry weight, nitrogen\r\nand fat, as the quantity of zinc compounds increased in the water added\r\nto the soil. Both the quality and the quantity of the crop were adversely\r\naffected. This decrease in the dry weight due to the presence of zinc was\r\nconfirmed by Jensch later on, and also by Nobbe, Baessler and Will (1884),\r\nwho state that both lead and zinc compounds work disadvantageously to\r\nvegetation even when they are present in such small quantities that the\r\nplants are outwardly sound, the harmful action appearing in the decrease\r\nof dry weight. Contrary to Baumann’s opinion, zinc carbonate is said\r\nto be one of the salts that exercises this insidious poisonous action.\r\nStorp (1883) noticed that the direct poisonous action of zinc compounds\r\nis largely destroyed by their admixture with soil, but he suggests that\r\na secondary cause of harm is introduced by the accumulation of insoluble\r\nzinc salts, so that the fertility of the soil is impaired to the detriment\r\nof the vegetation.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg (1908) throws out a suggestion that zinc is specially harmful\r\nto plant life when it occurs in conjunction with ammonia, but no further\r\nevidence has come to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Mode of action of zinc on plants._\r\n\r\nThe reason for the toxicity of zinc salts when present in soil forced\r\nitself upon the attention of some of the early investigators in this\r\nfield. Freytag (1868) put forward the hypothesis that the zinc oxide is\r\npartly or exclusively absorbed by the roots on account of the cell walls\r\nof the root being corroded by the very thin layer of zinc salts lying in\r\ncontact with it--the same theory as has been held with regard to copper.\r\nHe stated also that the quantity of zinc oxide taken up by the plant\r\nthrough its roots is strictly limited, not being proportional to the\r\nquantity occurring in the soil, but varying between narrow limits. Krauch\r\n(1882) found himself unable to accept another hypothesis which at one time\r\nfound favour, i.e. that the zinc salts kill the plants by coagulating the\r\nprotoplasm. If this were so, he argued, no plants at all could grow upon\r\nsoils containing zinc, and he was content to leave the cause as one yet to\r\nbe explained. Even at the present time, thirty years after, we know very\r\nlittle more about the physiological cause of the toxicity of zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Effect of zinc compounds on germination._\r\n\r\nIn the course of his investigations on the influence of zinc on vegetation\r\nFreytag just touched upon the question of seed germination. According to\r\nhis statement the presence of zinc oxide in the soil does not exercise\r\nmuch influence upon germination and the growth processes of plants. Little\r\nzinc is stored up in seeds and on this account seeds originating from\r\nplants containing zinc germinate quite normally and do not seem to be\r\naffected by the peculiar nutritive conditions of the parent plants.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases light seems to have something to do with the harm\r\nzinc compounds work on plants. Storp found that when clover seeds were\r\ngerminated in the dark on filter paper moistened with water containing\r\n·025 gm. ZnO per litre (added in the form of zinc sulphate) no deleterious\r\naction was observed. Barley seeds were soaked for four days in (_a_)\r\ndistilled water, (_b_) water with ·9 gm. ZnO per litre, which was\r\nfrequently changed. These seeds were then placed in the dark on filter\r\npapers soaked respectively with water and with the solution containing\r\nZnO. So long as no light was admitted, for a period of eleven days,\r\ngermination was uniform in both sets, but directly the covers were removed\r\nthe growth of the seeds with zinc ceased almost entirely, and they did not\r\nassume the green colour taken on by the unpoisoned seedlings. With maize\r\nthe germination was retarded by zinc even in the dark, but the harmful\r\naction of light on the plants with zinc was again established. These\r\nresults seem to indicate that the formation and activity of chlorophyll is\r\nimpaired by the toxic agent, and this hypothesis is borne out by the fact\r\nthat in many fungi and non-assimilating higher plants the toxic action of\r\nzinc is not evident.\r\n\r\nMicheels (1906) approached the matter from a totally different standpoint,\r\nseeking to discover what influence the valency of a metal has upon the\r\ntoxicity of its salts. In each of a series of experiments 1000 c.c. of ⅝\r\ndecinormal solution of sodium chloride in pure distilled water were used,\r\nwith the addition of varying strengths of calcium sulphate. Grains of\r\nwheat, which previously had been soaked in distilled water, were placed\r\nin the solutions, and it was found that the stronger the calcium sulphate\r\nsolution (up to 1/64 normal--the limit of experiment), the better the\r\ngrowth. The calcium sulphate was then replaced by salts of other bivalent\r\nmetals, as zinc, lead and barium, with analogous results, the quantity\r\nnecessary to obtain the maximum development varying with one and another;\r\nwith zinc, _n_/128 gave the maximum. In this case the toxic action of both\r\nsodium chloride and zinc sulphate on germination were considerably reduced\r\nby their mutual presence--a result which fits in perfectly with what is\r\nknown as to the masking effect of soluble substances upon toxic action.\r\nThe same fact obtains in the animal kingdom, where Loeb and others have\r\nfound that the toxicity of solutions of sodium chloride for marine animals\r\nis reduced by the introduction of salts of the bivalent metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Stimulation induced by zinc compounds._\r\n\r\nWhile the toxic action of zinc on the higher plants is so obvious that\r\nit forced itself upon the attention of investigators at an early date,\r\nthe question of possible stimulus is so much more subtle that it has only\r\ncome into prominence during the last twelve years, during which time an\r\nextraordinary amount of experimental work has been done with regard to\r\nit. One investigator, Gustavson, was somewhat in advance of his time,\r\nfor as long ago as 1881 he hinted at the possibility that zinc, aluminium\r\nand other substances might act as stimulants or rather as accelerators.\r\nHe indicated that the rôle of certain mineral salts in the plant economy\r\nis to enter into combination with the existing organic compounds, the\r\nresulting product of the reaction aiding in the formation of yet other\r\npurely organic compounds which ordinarily require for their formation\r\neither a very high temperature or a long time--in other words, such a\r\nmineral salt acts as a kind of accelerator.\r\n\r\nThis work was apparently not followed up immediately, but it evidently\r\ncontains the germ of the “catalytic” hypothesis of which so much has been\r\nmade during recent years.\r\n\r\nThe work dealing with zinc as a stimulant to plant growth has yielded such\r\nvarious and apparently contradictory results that the question cannot yet\r\nbe regarded as settled--it is even still more or less uncertain whether\r\nzinc compounds act as stimulants, or whether they are merely indifferent\r\nat concentrations below the toxic doses.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Stimulation in water cultures._\r\n\r\nTrue and Gies (1903) suspended seedlings of _Lupinus albus_ for 24–48\r\nhours with their roots in solutions of zinc sulphate and calcium sulphate\r\n(_m_/256)[7], and found that while zinc sulphate alone at _m_/8192\r\nretarded growth, yet with _m_/2048 ZnSO₄ and _m_/256 calcium sulphate\r\ngrowth was more than twice as rapid as in controls grown in water,\r\nindicating a marked stimulation. The presence of the calcium exercised\r\na definite ameliorating influence, reducing the toxicity of zinc to\r\none-sixteenth at most. The hypothesis put forward is that interior\r\nphysiological modifications are responsible for the observed differences\r\nin growth rate, the cell processes being so affected as to bring about\r\ndifferent results on cellular growth--i.e. that where mixtures of salts\r\nare concerned growth rate represents the physiological sum of oppositely\r\nacting stimuli or of antagonistic protoplasmic changes.\r\n\r\n[7] _m_ probably = gram molecular weight.\r\n\r\nKanda (1904) found that peas were stimulated in dilute solutions of\r\nzinc sulphate in the absence of nutrients, the optimum concentration\r\nbeing between ·00000287% and ·000001435% (about 1 in 34,840,000 and 1 in\r\n69,700,000), higher concentrations being poisonous when the solutions\r\nwere changed every four days. Jensen (1907) stated that he obtained no\r\nstimulation at all with water cultures, even in a solution as dilute as\r\n_n_/100,000 (about 1 in 1,239,000), but he suggested that it was quite\r\npossible that in proper concentration the zinc sulphate might prove to be\r\na stimulant.\r\n\r\nJavillier (1910) grew wheat in nutritive solutions with quantities of\r\nzinc salts containing from 1/5,000,000–1/250,000 zinc, and found that the\r\ndry weight of the plant was increased in so far as the stems and leaves\r\nwere concerned, though it remained uncertain whether a similar increase\r\noccurred in the grain.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the Rothamsted experiments shows that up to the\r\npresent time there is no conclusive evidence that zinc sulphate acts as a\r\nstimulant to barley grown in water cultures. As a general rule the growth\r\nof those plants with 1/5,000,000 ZnSO₄ approximates closely to that of\r\nthe controls. Beyond this the growth varies in different experiments.\r\nIn some cases lower concentrations from 1/5,000,000 to 1/50,000,000\r\nseem to cause some slight improvement in comparison with the normal,\r\nindicating a possible stimulus, but this improvement is not at all well\r\nmarked. In other cases these great dilutions are apparently indifferent,\r\nneither a poisonous nor a stimulative action being exerted on the growth\r\nof the plant (Fig. 6). With peas some increase has been obtained with\r\n1/20,000,000, and although the rise is only slight, yet it is possible\r\nthat it may indicate the setting in of a stimulus which would make itself\r\nmore strongly felt with still weaker concentrations (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Stimulation in sand cultures._\r\n\r\nWhile Jensen denied stimulation in wheat grown in water cultures even\r\nwhen the solutions were as dilute as _n_/100,000 zinc sulphate, yet\r\nhe found increase of growth with the same plant in artificial soil\r\n(quartz flour) to which much stronger solutions of zinc sulphate, from\r\n5_n_/10,000–_n_/10,000, had been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Increased growth in soil._\r\n\r\nNakamura (1904) dealt with a few plants of agricultural importance, adding\r\n·01 gram anhydrous zinc sulphate to 2300 grams air-dried soil. The marked\r\nindividuality in the response of the various plants to the poison is\r\nvery striking. Allium showed signs of increased growth throughout; Pisum\r\nwas apparently improved in the early stages of growth, but when the dry\r\nweights were taken at the end of the experiment no increase manifested\r\nitself in the weights of the plants treated with zinc; with Hordeum the\r\nsame quantity of zinc exercised a consistently injurious action. These\r\nresults with peas and barley corroborate those obtained in the Rothamsted\r\nexperiments with water cultures in that zinc sulphate proved to be less\r\ntoxic to peas than to barley.\r\n\r\nKanda found that both peas and beans when grown in soil as pot cultures\r\nwere improved by larger quantities of zinc sulphate than when they were\r\ntreated as water cultures--a result in full accordance with current\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWheat is evidently peculiarly sensitive to the effects of zinc compounds\r\nunder differing conditions. Javillier (1908 c) pointed out that while\r\nwheat is very susceptible to the toxic action of zinc, yet it can benefit\r\nby the presence of sufficiently small quantities of the compounds of\r\nthe metal. Rice is another cereal that is said to respond to the action\r\nof zinc sulphate, as Roxas, working in pot cultures with soil both with\r\nand without the addition of nutritive salts, obtained an acceleration of\r\ngrowth on the addition of _m_/1000 zinc sulphate, a quantity so remarkably\r\ngreat that it might be expected to act as a toxic rather than as a\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\nWith phanerogams the zinc question is not only concerned with the effect\r\nof the metal upon germination, but also with its effect upon the later\r\ngrowth of the green plants, and on the physiological functions involving\r\nthe construction of substances at the expense of mineral elements and the\r\ncarbon dioxide of the air. Javillier holds that the indications are that\r\nzinc would prove to be profitable if applied to crops as a “complementary”\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Direct action of zinc salts on leaves._\r\n\r\nDandeno (1900) applied zinc sulphate in drops to the leaves of Ampelopsis,\r\nand found that the solution was not all absorbed by the leaf, but that a\r\nslight dark ring of a yellow colour was produced, and he was induced to\r\nthink that some local stimulation was produced if the salt was presented\r\nin sufficient dilution.\r\n\r\nKlopsch (1908) discussed the effect on plant growth of zinc derived from\r\nindustries producing zinc fumes. Zinc oxide from the fumes is deposited on\r\nthe leaves, and Klopsch stated that the rain and dew containing dissolved\r\nzinc compounds find entrance to the tissues by way of the stomates and\r\nwork injury to the plants. Against this, however, it must be remembered\r\nthat these same fumes also contain other substances which are admittedly\r\nharmful to plant life, and so the deleterious effect may be partly or\r\neven chiefly due to these substances rather than to the zinc. Yet it\r\nis probable that at least some of the depreciation is due to the zinc.\r\nTreboux (1903) tested the effect of zinc sulphate on shoots of _Elodea\r\ncanadensis_. If the shoots were placed in _n_/100,000 (= ·000016%) zinc\r\nsulphate no reduction of assimilation (as observed by counting the number\r\nof oxygen bubbles emitted per minute) took place, and replacement in water\r\napparently had no effect either way. When however the shoots were placed\r\nin (1) water, (2) ·00008% zinc sulphate, (3) fresh ·00008% zinc sulphate,\r\n(4) water again, it was found that while the first solution of zinc\r\nsulphate had apparently no effect on assimilation, yet during the second\r\nimmersion a gradual reduction in assimilation set in, which reduction was\r\ncontinued after the return to pure water, so that the toxic action of the\r\nzinc sulphate upon the shoots was clearly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EFFECT OF ZINC ON CERTAIN OF THE LOWER PLANTS.\r\n\r\nAmong the fungi, one species stands out in special prominence on account\r\nof the great amount of work that has been done on it with regard to\r\nits reactions to zinc salts. _Aspergillus niger_ = _Sterigmatocystis\r\nnigra_ van Tgh was used as a test plant by Raulin (1869), who evidently\r\nconsidered that zinc was an essential primary constituent of the food\r\nsolutions of the fungi, ·07 parts zinc sulphate being added to each 1500\r\nparts of water. In his experiments he tested (1) ordinary nutritive\r\nsolution, (2) nutritive solution with various salts added, as zinc\r\nsulphate, (3) nutritive solution and salts (as 2) and also powdered\r\nporcelain. (2) gave a crop of Aspergillus about 3·1–3·5 times better\r\nthan (1), while (3) was even better still. Sulphate of iron also proved\r\nstimulating in its action, but Raulin stated that zinc cannot replace\r\niron, as both are essential.\r\n\r\nOno (1900) determined the relation between the weight of the mould crop\r\nin grams and the quantity of sugar used up in the presence of varying\r\namounts of zinc sulphate. The amount of sugar used was always greater in\r\nthe crops with ·0037–·0297% zinc sulphate by weight than in the control\r\ncrops, indicating a stimulation caused by zinc.\r\n\r\nRichter (1901) carried out rather similar experiments. When grown in\r\nsolutions without and with 1/700,000 gram molecule zinc sulphate the\r\ndry weights of the mould were practically the same for the first two\r\ndays, then the dry weight of the zinc crop shot ahead for a day or two,\r\na depression setting in on the fifth day. Without zinc a less increase\r\ntook place, and a similar drop was noticeable about the sixth day. The\r\nconclusion drawn is that the stimulation due to the zinc occurs chiefly in\r\nthe first few days and also that the rise in the sugar consumed is more\r\nrapid at first with the moulds treated with zinc. Concentrations above\r\n1/600 are harmful, but in weaker solutions zinc is a definite stimulant.\r\n\r\nCoupin (1903) re-investigated some of Raulin’s work under more antiseptic\r\nconditions in order to see what substances were really needed by the\r\nmould and whether certain elements declared essential were really\r\nso. He concluded that iron and zinc are of no use in the nutrition of\r\n_Sterigmatocystis nigra_, but that the zinc retards the development of\r\nmycelium when food is abundant, killing it if it is badly nourished. This\r\ndenial of stimulation was controverted by Javillier (1907) who re-tested\r\nRaulin’s solution with extreme care, growing Sterigmatocystis in\r\n\r\n    (_a_) normal Raulin’s solution with zinc,\r\n    (_b_) Raulin’s solution without zinc.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of crops _a_/_b_ varied from 2·3–3·1 in four experiments,\r\nvindicating the favourable action of zinc. With regard to the optimum\r\nvalue for zinc the mould seemed to be perfectly indifferent to the\r\npresence of medium quantities but very sensitive to extremes, the maximum\r\nweights being reached in dilutions between 1/10,000,000 and 1/250,000,\r\nwhile quantities above 1/25,000 were toxic in their action. At a dilution\r\nof 1/50,000,000 stimulation was still evident, though in a less degree\r\nthan with the optimal concentrations.\r\n\r\nJavillier maintains that zinc is fixed by the fungus, the whole of the\r\nzinc present in dilute solutions being taken up, only part being utilised\r\nin stronger solutions. The value of accordance between the quantity of\r\nzinc fixed and the quantity supplied decreases rapidly with increase of\r\nconcentration. Sterigmatocystis is able to fix without harm a quantity\r\nof zinc equal to more than 1/1100 of its weight. Zinc is regarded as a\r\ncatalytic element, as essential to the well-being of the plant as are the\r\nmore obvious nutrients, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, &c., in spite of the\r\nminute traces in which it occurs.\r\n\r\nA few tests on yeasts made by Javillier showed that with vegetative yeasts\r\nzinc has a specific action, a consistent increase occurring in the amount\r\nof yeast formed and in the amount of sugar consumed as the quantity\r\nof zinc increased from 0–1/10,000,000–1/10,000. With ferment yeast,\r\nhowever, zinc exerted no appreciable action. These results lend force to\r\nthe conclusion of Richards (1897) who carried out experiments on fungi\r\nwith various nutritive media with the addition of certain salts of zinc,\r\nnickel, manganese, iron, &c. He considered that his general results showed\r\nthat the fact of a chemical stimulation of certain metallic salts upon\r\nthe growth of fungi is established, although it must not be considered\r\nwithout further investigations that all fungi react in the same degree to\r\nthe same reagent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nAs matters stand at the present day, it appears that it is still\r\nuncertain whether higher plants grown in water cultures are susceptible\r\nto stimulation by zinc salts. If a stimulus does exist, it must be at\r\nexceedingly great dilutions, but further evidence is needed. In soil\r\ncultures, however, the fact of increased growth seems to be more firmly\r\nestablished, certain species responding to zinc salts when used as manure,\r\nthough no increase has been obtained with other species. It must always\r\nbe remembered that the action may be an indirect one. The soil is very\r\ncomplex in its constitution, and it is impossible to determine the exact\r\naction of the added poison upon it, so that a stimulating effect need not\r\nnecessarily be due to a direct action of a substance upon the plant, but\r\nit may be the result of more favourable conditions for life induced by\r\nthe action of the substance upon the soil.\r\n\r\nAmong the fungi the stimulation of _Aspergillus niger_ by minute traces\r\nof zinc compounds seems to be well proved, though again it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that all fungi will react in the same way to zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF ARSENIC COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF ARSENIC IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of arsenic as an occasional constituent of plants has\r\nbeen recognised for many years. Chatin (1845) found that if a plant were\r\nsupplied with arsenical compounds at the roots arsenic was absorbed, but\r\nthat it was distributed unequally to the various tissues. The greatest\r\naccumulation of the element was in the floral receptacle and the leaves,\r\nwhile it was scarce in the fruits, seeds, stems, roots and petals. E.\r\nDavy (1859) commented on the presence of arsenic in plants cultivated\r\nfor food. He grew peas in pots and watered them for a short time with a\r\nsaturated aqueous solution of arsenious acid, the application being then\r\ndiscontinued. The plants, apparently uninjured by the treatment, flowered\r\nand formed seeds. On analysis arsenic was readily detected in all parts\r\nof the plant, including the seeds. Other analyses revealed the presence\r\nof the element in cabbage plants (from pots) and turnips (from field),\r\nboth of which had been manured with superphosphate containing some amount\r\nof arsenic. This absorption of arsenic by the roots of plants was further\r\nestablished by Phillips (1882).\r\n\r\nVarious physiological workers have pointed out that this element is\r\nfrequently or usually present in animal tissues. Cerný (1901) reached\r\nthe general conclusion that minimal traces of arsenic can occur in animal\r\norganisms, but that these play no part in the organism and indeed are not\r\nconstant in their occurrence. Bertrand (1902) established its presence in\r\nminute quantities in the thyroid glands of the ox and pig, hair and nails\r\nof the dog, and the feathers of the goose. Gautier and Clausmann (1904)\r\nrealised the constant presence of arsenic in human tissues and recognised\r\nthat it must inevitably be introduced into the body with the food. This\r\nled them to estimate the arsenic present in various animal and vegetable\r\nfoods, some of their results being given in the following table.\r\n\r\n_Arsenic per 100 parts fresh substance in µ gr._ (= thousandth part of a\r\nmilligram)[8].\r\n\r\n    Wheat (Victoria--complete grain)  ·7\r\n      „   (from Franche Comté)        ·85\r\n    White bread                       ·71\r\n    Whole green cabbage               ·2\r\n    Outside leaves of cabbage         ·0 (absent)\r\n    Green haricots                    ·0    „\r\n    Turnip                            ·36\r\n    Potatoes                         1·12\r\n\r\n    [8] 0^{µ gr.}, 1 = 0·0001 mg.\r\n\r\nArsenic was also found in wine and beer and in considerable quantities\r\nin sea water and various kinds of salt. Since it cannot be found in some\r\nthings even in the least traces, the authors conclude that it is incorrect\r\nto say that the element is always present or that it is essential to all\r\nliving cells.\r\n\r\nS. H. Collins (1902) found that barley is able to absorb relatively\r\nlarge quantities of arsenic. The plants were grown in pots on soil which\r\noriginally contained a certain amount of the substance, and various\r\ncombinations of arsenic acid, arsenious acid and superphosphate were\r\nadded. Particulars and details are not given by the author, except\r\nthat arsenic was detected by Reinsch’s test in the grains from all the\r\nexperimental pots, and in one case (not specified) in the upper and lower\r\nhalves of the straw and in the threshed ears. The analyses of the soil at\r\nthe close of the experiments showed the presence of 7–22 parts arsenious\r\nacid per million.\r\n\r\nWehmer (1911) quotes references to the occurrence of arsenic in _Vitis\r\nvinifera_. The element was detected in the ash of the must and its\r\npresence was attributed to treatment of the plants with arsenical\r\ncompounds. In this connection it is interesting to note the observation\r\nof Swain and Harkins (1908), who, while acknowledging the absorption of\r\narsenic from the soil by many plants, yet indicate that in the case of\r\nthose plants which are exposed to smelter smoke the arsenic is deposited\r\non the vegetation, and is not absorbed by the latter from the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EFFECT OF ARSENIC ON THE GROWTH OF HIGHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Toxic effect._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxic action of arsenic compounds in water cultures in the presence\r\nof nutrients._\r\n\r\nThe poisonous action of arsenic on plants has long been recognised. Chatin\r\n(1845) gave accounts of tissues poisoned by strong arsenical solutions.\r\nNobbe, Baessler and Will (1884) carried on water culture experiments\r\nwith buckwheat, oats, maize and alder, and found that arsenic was a\r\nparticularly strong poison for these plants. When small quantities of\r\narsenious acid (As₂O₃) were added to the food solutions, growth was\r\nmeasurably hindered by a concentration of 1/1,000,000 As (reckoned as\r\nAs). The element only appears in plants in very small quantity and can\r\nnever be detected in notable quantities. The aerial organs show the effect\r\nof arsenical poisoning by intense withering, interrupted by periods\r\nof recovery, but eventually followed by death. It was also found that\r\nif plant roots were exposed to the action of arsenical solutions for a\r\nshort period, say ten minutes, and then were transferred to normal food\r\nsolutions, the action of the poison was delayed, but eventually hindering\r\nof growth or death occurred, according to the strength of the poison used\r\nin the first solution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Nobbe, Baessler and Will were establishing the\r\ngreat toxicity of the lower oxide of arsenic, Knop (1884) was carrying\r\nthe matter a step further by comparing the action of arsenious and arsenic\r\nacid and their derivatives on plant growth. He established the fact that\r\nwhile arsenious acid is a strong poison for maize plants, arsenic acid in\r\nsmall quantities is not toxic to the roots and that the plants can produce\r\nflowers and fruit in its presence. Arsenic acid applied as potassium\r\narsenate proved to be harmful to young maize seedlings if the solutions\r\ncontained ·05–·1 gm. arsenic acid per litre (= 1/–2/20,000 arsenic acid).\r\nIf however the plants were allowed to form 10–15 leaves in a pure food\r\nsolution and then when strongly rooted were transferred to a solution\r\nof ·05 gm. arsenic acid per litre, they were found to grow strongly and\r\ndevelope big healthy leaves. Careful measurements indicated that the\r\ndevelopment is unchecked by the addition of the poison, though arsenic\r\nwas determined in the ash of the treated plants.\r\n\r\nStoklasa (1896, 1898) tested the effect of arsenic compounds on plant\r\ngrowth with special attention to their comparative relation to phosphoric\r\nacid. He corroborated Knop’s statement as to the greater toxicity\r\nof arsenious acid and arsenites in comparison with arsenic acid and\r\narsenates, stating that 1/100,000 mol. wt. arsenious acid per litre causes\r\ndefinite trouble in plants, while with arsenic acid 1/1000 mol. wt. per\r\nlitre first shows a noticeable toxicity. Water culture experiments were\r\nmade with and without phosphoric acid, in each case with and without the\r\naddition of arsenic and arsenious acid. It was found that the arsenic\r\nacid was unable to replace the phosphoric acid, the plants decaying in the\r\nflower in the absence of the latter. In the complete absence of phosphoric\r\nacid, arsenic acid causes a strong production of organic substances up to\r\nthe flowering time. The following figures were obtained with maize:--\r\n\r\n    ·002 gm. As₂O₃  with P₂O₅        2·84 gm. dry wt.\r\n    ·005 gm.   „     „    „          2·37      „\r\n    ·01  gm.

Young seedlings were brought\r\ninto solutions containing 1/10,000 mol. wt. arsenious acid (= ·019 gm.\r\nAs₂O₃ per litre) and the plants died in a very short time.\r\n\r\n    Hordeum distichum      46 _hours_\r\n    Polygonum Fagopyrum    84    „\r\n        „     Persecaria   90    „\r\n\r\nWith ten times the strength of arsenic acid (1/1000 mol. wt. = ·23 gm.\r\nper litre) the plants took much longer to kill.\r\n\r\n    Hordeum distichum      24·5 _days_\r\n    Polygonum Fagopyrum    40     „\r\n        „     Persecaria   42     „\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have been carried on at Rothamsted with peas and\r\nbarley. With arsenious acid on barley a depressing influence is manifest\r\neven at a concentration of 1/10,000,000, while no growth at all is\r\npossible with 1/10,000 and upwards. Apparently the toxic action on the\r\nroot ceases at a higher strength than on the shoot, as with 1/1,000,000\r\nand less the dry weight of the root remains practically constant. At this\r\nsame strength the shoots look better than the controls, but this is not\r\napparent in the dry weights (Figs. 9 and 10). With peas the depression\r\nis again evident to 1/10,000,000, but the plants are more sensitive to\r\nthe higher concentrations, as no growth can take place in the presence\r\nof 1/250,000 arsenious acid (Fig. 11). A striking difference is observed\r\nwith arsenic acid on barley, as apparently this does not act as a toxic\r\neven with such comparatively great concentrations as 1/100,000, though\r\npossibly the shoot is slightly depressed by this strength (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.

With peas\r\nthe results vary somewhat in the different tests, the depression with\r\n1/2,500,000 and less being usually slight, though occasionally it is much\r\nmore strongly marked (Fig. 14). In a single series with sodium arsenate\r\nbarley was apparently unaffected by a concentration of 1/1,000,000, but\r\nfrom this point down to 1/250,000,000 a constant _depression_ showed\r\nitself, which was paralleled by a similar depression in the sodium\r\narsenite series from 1/25,000,000 to 1/250,000,000, the curves grading\r\ndownwards instead of up towards the normal. With peas sodium arsenate has\r\nlittle or no action, though it is just possible that the rather irregular\r\ncurves indicate a very slight depression below the normal throughout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.

(June 27th–Aug. 10th, 1911.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Toxic effect of arsenic compounds in sand cultures._\r\n\r\nComparatively few tests seem to have been made as to the action of\r\narsenical solutions in sand cultures. Stoklasa (1898) repeated his water\r\nculture work, using sand as a medium, and found analogous results by the\r\ntwo methods, i.e. that arsenites are far more toxic than arsenates, and\r\nalso that the degree of toxicity of a salt varies with the plant to which\r\nit is applied, as was shown by the fact that different plants lived for\r\nvarying times when treated with similar strengths of solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Toxic effect of arsenic when applied to soil cultures._\r\n\r\nDaubeny (1862) watered barley plants with a solution of arsenious acid,\r\n1 ounce in 10 gallons, five times in succession, and found that the crop\r\narrived at maturity about a fortnight earlier than the untreated part of\r\nthe crop, though the amount harvested was rather less. With turnips four\r\nwaterings had no effect upon the time of maturity, but again the crop was\r\nslightly decreased. The analyses made indicated that no arsenic was taken\r\ninto the tissues, but that it merely adhered to the external surfaces.\r\n\r\nGorup-Besanez (1863) mixed 30 grams arsenious acid with 30·7 litres[9]\r\nsoil, growing two plants on this quantity of earth. Most of his\r\nexperimental plants (_Polygonum Fagopyrum_, _Pisum sativum_, and _Secale\r\ncereale_) developed normally, but _Panicum italicum_ died soon after the\r\nplants appeared above the surface, the leaves being very badly coloured.\r\nAnalyses by Marsh’s test showed no trace of arsenic in 20 grams dry matter\r\nfrom _Secale cereale_, but in 148 grams _Polygonum Fagopyrum_ the presence\r\nof arsenic was evident, though the mirror formed was weak. With such a\r\nlarge proportion of arsenious acid in the soil it seems hardly conceivable\r\nthat the plants were not injured to some extent, and also it is probable\r\nthat with more careful analyses arsenic would have been detected in those\r\ninstances in which its presence was denied. Yet it must be remembered that\r\nDavy (1859) had treated pea plants in pots with a _saturated_ solution\r\nof arsenious acid for a short time and had stated that the plants were\r\nuninjured. Thus both Gorup-Besanez and Davy concur in the opinion that\r\n_Pisum sativum_ is indifferent to relatively large quantities of arsenious\r\nacid when presented in the soil, whereas the Rothamsted experiments show\r\nthat in water cultures the plant is extremely sensitive even to minute\r\ntraces of the substance. It is possible that the arsenic in the solution\r\nadded to the soil enters into combination with other substances, forming\r\ninsoluble compounds, thus being removed from the sphere of action and\r\nrendered unable to affect plant life. If this be so, the apparent immunity\r\nof certain plants to arsenious acid is explained. F. C. Phillips (1882),\r\nin his experiments on various flowering plants, such as geraniums, coleas\r\nand pansies, found that compounds of arsenic in the soil exercised a\r\ndistinct poisoning influence, tending, when present in large amount, to\r\ncheck the formation of roots, so that the vitality of the plant was so\r\nfar reduced as to interfere with nutrition and growth, or even to kill\r\nit outright. He also stated that traces of arsenic were found in all the\r\nplants grown upon the poisoned soil.\r\n\r\n    [9] 30 grams arsenious acid to 30·7 “cubik Decimeter” soil = about\r\n    ·1%.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that a certain proportion\r\nof arsenic is frequently present in the superphosphate used as manure.\r\nIn view of the known toxicity of arsenical compounds to plant life the\r\nquestion arose as to whether superphosphate manuring would exercise a\r\ndetrimental influence on account of its arsenic content. Experiments\r\ncarried out by Stoklasa (1898), however, indicate that there is not\r\nsufficient arsenic in maximum doses of superphosphate to exercise a\r\ntoxic action in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Physiological considerations._\r\n\r\nThe physiological action of arsenic compounds on plant life early\r\nattracted the attention of investigators. Chatin (1845) put forward some\r\nrather curious and unexpected considerations with regard to this action.\r\nHe stated that the effect of arsenic on plant growth is determined more by\r\nthe constitution and temperament of individual plants than by their age,\r\nand that apparently difference in the sex of plants is of no significance.\r\nThe chief determining agent, however, is the species, and Chatin found\r\nthat as a general rule Cryptogams are more sensitive than Phanerogams,\r\nand Monocotyledons than Dicotyledons, as is shown by the fact that under\r\ntreatment the former perish first. Some extreme exceptions exist, though,\r\nas _Mucor mucedo_ and _Penicillium glaucum_ will grow on moist arsenious\r\nacid, whereas leguminous plants are killed by an arsenical solution in a\r\nfew hours. Chatin held the view that elimination of the poison succeeded\r\nits absorption, and that this elimination is complete if the plant lives\r\nlong enough. Here again the species exerts a great influence on the\r\nexcretory functions of the plants. Lupins and Phaseolus are presumably\r\nable to eliminate in six weeks all the arsenious acid they can absorb\r\nwithout dying. Most Dicotyledons need 3–5 months, while Monocotyledons\r\nretain traces of poison for six months after its absorption. Lichens\r\nare said to eliminate it more slowly still. Again, woody species are\r\nlonger in freeing themselves than herbaceous, and young plants carry out\r\nthe elimination more easily than old plants. The excretory function is\r\ninfluenced by other physiological factors such as dryness and season. The\r\ntoxic effects and elimination are supposed to act inversely and parallel,\r\nthe absorbed arsenious acid combining with alkaline bases, making a very\r\nsoluble salt which is excreted by the roots. Calcium chloride is given as\r\nthe antidote to arsenious acid, all soluble acid being “neutralised” by\r\nit. This view of the elimination of arsenic apparently did not gain much\r\nsupport, as no further references to the matter have so far come to light.\r\nIn view of the work of some modern investigators (Wilfarth, Römer and\r\nWimmer) on the excretion of salts by plant roots, the idea may prove of\r\nfresh interest. Chatin also found that moving or still air influenced the\r\nworking of the poison, indicating that the external physical conditions\r\naffect the toxic action considerably. Nearly forty years later Nobbe,\r\nBaessler and Will found that, if transpiration were hindered by placing\r\nplants in a dark or moist room, it was possible to keep the plants\r\nturgescent in arsenic solutions for a long time without thereby increasing\r\nthe toxic effect later on. The poisonous action proceeds from the roots,\r\nof which the protoplasm is disorganised and the osmotic action hindered.\r\nFinally, in the presence of sufficient of the poison, the root dies\r\nwithout growth.\r\n\r\nStoklasa (1896, 1898) again found that phanerogamic plants can withstand\r\narsenic poisoning for some time in the dark or in CO₂-free air, provided\r\nthat glucose is given in the food solution. The arsenic poisoning is\r\nat its maximum during carbon assimilation by means of chlorophyll. The\r\ntoxic action of arsenious and arsenic acids, especially in phanerogams,\r\nis due to injury to the chlorophyll activity. The destruction of the\r\nliving molecule is far more rapid in the chlorophyll apparatus than in\r\nthe protoplasm of the plant cell.\r\n\r\nThus it seems that the physiological cause of the toxicity of arsenic is\r\npartly a direct action on the root protoplasm, whereby its osmotic action\r\nis hindered, and partly a detrimental action upon those functions which\r\nare directly concerned with the elaboration processes of nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Effect of arsenic compounds on germination._\r\n\r\nIn view of the great toxicity of arsenic to plants in their various stages\r\nof development, one would naturally expect to find a similar action with\r\nregard to the germination of the seeds. Davy (1859) casually mentioned\r\ncases in which watering with arsenical solutions or dipping seeds in\r\narseniated water prevented germination. Heckel (1875) found that arsenious\r\nacid checks germination and kills the embryo at relatively feeble doses,\r\n·25 gm. to 90 gm. water.[10] Guthrie and Helms (1903–4–5) carried out a\r\nsystematic series of experiments to test the effect of arsenic compounds\r\nupon different farm crops. Various amounts of arsenious acid were added\r\nto soil in pot experiments, and the seeds of the several crops were\r\nthen sown. With barley, wheat and rye 0·10% arsenious acid had little\r\nor no effect on germination, while an increase in the poison exercised\r\na retarding action. Maize could withstand 0·40% arsenious acid without\r\nretardation being perceptible. The aftergrowth with the different crops\r\nvaried considerably. The wheat plants with 0·10% arsenious acid grew all\r\nright at first, but later on they developed weakly. The toxic action\r\nincreased rapidly as the strength of the poison rose in the different\r\npots. Barley proved even more sensitive than wheat, for even 0·05%\r\narsenious acid affected the growth adversely. After a time the plants\r\nwith 0·05–0·06% recovered and grew strongly, though not so well as the\r\ncontrols, but those with 0·10% practically died off. Rye behaved in the\r\nreverse way from wheat. The plants with 0·10% were slightly checked at\r\nfirst but later recovered and made growth quite equal to the check plants.\r\nGrowth was stunted with 0·20% arsenious acid, and the plants were killed\r\nwith 0·30%, so that rye is far less sensitive than barley. With maize the\r\ngrowth was slightly affected with 0·05% As₂O₃, and increasingly so with\r\ngreater quantities. It was also found that the action of 0·8% As₂O₃ was\r\nstrongly adverse to the germination of all plants, and that above this\r\nstrength germination was altogether prevented.\r\n\r\n    [10] In the present state of our knowledge such a concentration\r\n    seems relatively strong!\r\n\r\nThe results show very clearly how impossible it is to draw any general\r\nconclusions with regard to the action of arsenic compounds on plants, as\r\nthey emphasise the strong individuality of the species in their reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Do arsenic compounds stimulate higher plants?_\r\n\r\nThe question of stimulation due to arsenic does not seem to have engaged\r\nthe attention of investigators to any extent. Water culture experiments at\r\nRothamsted have so far yielded negative results, and no stimulation has\r\nyet been obtained with any plant, with the possible exception of white\r\nlupin with sodium arsenite. In a single series a stimulus was suggested,\r\nbeginning to make itself felt at 1/500,000, rising to an optimum at\r\n1/10,000,000. No stress can be laid on this result, as it is never safe\r\nto draw any certain conclusions without several repetitions of the same\r\nexperiment. With arsenic acid on barley a possible stimulus is sometimes\r\nindicated to the eye, the plants being fine and of a particularly healthy\r\ndark colour, but this is not corroborated by the dry weights. Additional\r\ntests were made with peas and barley, treated with sodium arsenite and\r\narsenate, the dilutions being carried down to 1/250,000,000, but no\r\nevidence of stimulus was obtained, so that it hardly seems possible that\r\narsenic can act as a stimulative agent for these two plants when grown in\r\nwater cultures. It had been thought that the failure to find a stimulation\r\npoint hitherto might be due to the too great concentration of the toxic\r\nsubstance rather than to the actual inability of the poison to stimulate,\r\nbut this hypothesis must now be dismissed so far as these plants are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EFFECT OF ARSENIC COMPOUNDS ON CERTAIN OF THE LOWER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Algae._\r\n\r\nLoew (1883) was sceptical concerning the specific toxicity of arsenic for\r\nplant protoplasm. He was convinced that arsenic and arsenious acid were\r\npoisonous to algae, not because of their specific character as arsenical\r\ncompounds, but because of their acid nature, algae being peculiarly\r\nsensitive to any acid, and he maintained that these substances were not\r\nmore poisonous than vinegar or citric acid. He placed various species\r\nof _Spirogyra_ in solutions of ·2 gm. potassium arsenate per litre water\r\n(1/5000), and found that the algae grew well without making any abnormal\r\ngrowth in a fortnight, showing hardly one dead thread. Some of this\r\nalga was then transferred to a 1/1000 solution of potassium arsenate.\r\nThis suited it excellently and it increased and the appearance under\r\nthe microscope was very fresh and strong, which was attributed more to\r\nthe potash than to the arsenic acid. Loew maintained that for the lower\r\nanimals and for many of the lower plants arsenic in the form of neutral\r\nsalts is not a poison. When the differentiation of the protoplasm into\r\ncertain organs reaches a specific degree in the higher plants, then the\r\npoisonous action of the arsenic compounds comes into play.\r\n\r\nKnop (1884) found that certain unicellular green algae grew luxuriantly\r\nin a neutral solution supplied with potassium arsenate. Bouilhac (1894)\r\nconcerned himself chiefly with the possibility of the replacement of\r\nphosphates by arsenates. He recognised that the influence of arsenic\r\nis not the same on all species of plants, so he confined his attention\r\nto certain of the algae. _Stichococcus bacillaris_ Naegeli was found\r\nto live and reproduce itself in a mineral solution containing arsenic\r\nacid. Even in the presence of phosphoric acid the arsenic acid favours\r\ngrowth, the best dose being about 1/1000. The arsenic acid is capable of\r\npartly replacing phosphoric acid. Other species of algae, _Protococcus\r\ninfusionum_, _Ulothrix tenerrima_, and _Phormidium Valderianum_ invaded\r\nthe original culture of Stichococcus from the atmosphere, but with no\r\narsenic or phosphoric acid their development was poor. The jars with\r\narsenic compounds were invaded by still more species which grew strongly.\r\nUnder these conditions it is evident that these algae are capable of\r\nassimilating arsenic, and the addition of arsenic acid to a solution\r\nfree from phosphoric acid is sufficient to enable these algae to live\r\nsatisfactorily, the arsenates in this case replacing the phosphates.\r\nOno (1900) found that algae are favourably influenced by small doses of\r\npoisons, the optimal quantity for algae being lower than that for fungi.\r\nProtococcus showed a possible stimulus when grown in concentrations of\r\npotassium arsenate varying from ·00002–·0005%. This possible stimulus is\r\ninteresting in view of the failure to observe stimulation in higher plants\r\nby minute traces of arsenic.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Fungi._\r\n\r\nThe effect of arsenic on fungi is of special interest in that it has a\r\ndirect bearing upon hygienic and commercial interests. Gosio (1892, 1897,\r\n1901) found that certain of the fungi, _Mucor mucedo_ and _Aspergillus\r\nglaucum_, will grow on various arsenic compounds and exercise a reducing\r\ninfluence on them. These moulds attack all oxygen compounds of arsenic\r\nincluding copper arsenite, and develope arsenical gases. Sulphur compounds\r\nof arsenic are not influenced by these fungi. The same moulds would,\r\nif cultivated in soil containing arsenic, develope hydrogen arsenide.\r\n_Penicillium glaucum_ has such a strong and definite action on arsenic\r\ncompounds that he states that there is no doubt of the possibility of\r\npoisoning by arsenical gas in a room hung with paper containing arsenic.\r\nThe compounds are so extraordinarily potent that if a mouse is placed\r\nin a vessel in which the mould is strongly developed in the presence\r\nof arsenic, it dies in a few seconds. _Penicillium brevicaule_ uses the\r\nelement in its development as a food substance. If material containing\r\narsenic is placed in contact with dead fungi no reaction occurs. The life\r\nactivity of the mould is evidently necessary for the reaction by which\r\nthe arsenic-containing gases are liberated. Csapodi (1894) put forward the\r\nearlier results of Gosio and noted that the so-called arsenical fungicides\r\ndo not only fail to kill the mould fungi but actually favour their\r\ndevelopment. This action explains why wallpaper containing arsenic is so\r\ndisadvantageous in a room. Abba (1898) severely tested Gosio’s method\r\nof detecting arsenic by means of growths of _Penicillium brevicaule_,\r\nwhereby arsenic gases are liberated, vindicating the method completely,\r\nand establishing the test as an exceptionally delicate one. Segale (1904)\r\napplied the same method to the detection of the presence of arsenic in\r\nanimal tissues.\r\n\r\nOno (1900) grew Penicillium cultures with solutions of potassium arsenate\r\nand found no important differences either of depression or stimulation.\r\nOrlowski (1902–3) stated that small doses of arsenic (1/1000–1/100% Sodium\r\narsen--[11]) stimulate the growth of _Aspergillus niger_, larger doses up\r\nto ⅛% retard growth, while ⅙% kills. Spores of the fungus taken from soil\r\ncontaining arsenic are said to possess an immunity against arsenic, in\r\nthat they germinate in the presence of an arsenic content which rapidly\r\nkills control fungi. This immunity is not specific for arsenic, but\r\nextends also to other poisons. The chemical composition and water content\r\nare not altered.\r\n\r\n    [11] The exact compound is not specified in the abstracted paper,\r\n    1/1000–1/100% Natr. Ars. being given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe toxic effect of arsenic upon higher plants is much more marked\r\nwith arsenious acid and its compounds than with arsenic acid and its\r\nderivatives. No definite evidence of stimulation has yet been obtained\r\nwith any arsenic compound, however great the dilution at which it is\r\napplied. With certain algae a stimulus may occur, and it is possible that\r\narsenic acid is capable of replacing phosphoric acid to some extent under\r\ncertain conditions. With fungi the toxic effect of great concentrations\r\nis marked with certain species, but there are others which are capable of\r\nliving happily on arsenical compounds and of liberating highly poisonous\r\narsenic gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF BORON COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF BORON IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe first claim to the discovery of boron in plants was put forward\r\nin 1857 by Wittstein and Apoiger, who carried out investigations\r\non the Abyssinian Saoria (seeds of _Maasa_ or _Maessa picta_, N.O.\r\nPrimulaceae[12]). In the course of analyses a crystalline mass was\r\nobtained which was found to contain chlorine, phosphoric acid, lime, and\r\nboric acid. The discovery apparently attracted little attention and for\r\nabout another thirty years the matter was again allowed to sink into\r\noblivion. Then it came to the front again, and from 1888 onwards one\r\ninvestigator after another demonstrated the presence of boron in various\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n    [12] According to Engler’s classification this plant belongs to N.O.\r\n    _Myrsinaceae_.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Baumert detected boron in French, German, and Spanish wines\r\nwithout exception, while E. O. von Lippman (1888) demonstrated it in sugar\r\nmust and also in the leaves and root of the sugar beet. In the latter case\r\nthe reactions were so definite that the presence of more than a minimal\r\namount of boric acid was conjectured.\r\n\r\nCrampton (1889) tested various fruits, but while he found boron in every\r\npart of the watermelon, he could get no reaction with apples or with\r\ncertain samples of sugar cane. He predicted, however, that the occurrence\r\nof boron would prove to be more general in the plant kingdom than had\r\npreviously been supposed. The next year (1890) Hotter extended the work\r\non fruits, testing for boron in the fruits, leaves, and twigs of certain\r\nplants, and finding it in the apple, pear, cherry, raspberry, fig, and\r\nothers. His results indicated that fruits are relatively rich in boron.\r\nLater on (1895) Hotter carried his experiments further, and he stated\r\nthat stone fruits are richer in boric acid than are berries and pomes.\r\nThe accumulation of boron is in the fruit itself, the other parts of the\r\nplant containing little. The quantities of boric acid found in the ash of\r\nthe various fruits ranged from ·58% in the “Autumn Reinette” apple to ·06%\r\nin figs. Bechi had previously (1891) detected boron in the ash of figs,\r\nlove-apple, and rubus fruits from Pitecio, but he attributed this to the\r\npresence of boric acid or borates in the soil at the place.\r\n\r\nPasserini (1891) found traces of boron in the stems of chickpea\r\nplants, while in 1892 Brand determined boric acid in the ash of beer.\r\nIn consequence of this various samples of hops were ashed without the\r\naddition of any alkali, and then the ash was distilled with sulphuric\r\nacid and methyl alcohol. When tested all the hops showed relatively large\r\nquantities of boric acid in comparison with beer, hence he argued that\r\nthe boric acid in beer is derived from the hops. Boron was discovered in\r\nvarious parts of the hop plant--in the clusters, leaves, pedicels, and\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nJay (1895) analysed many plants and plant products grown in various soils\r\nand waters, and arrived at the conclusion that boron is of practically\r\nuniversal occurrence in the plant world. Of all vegetable liquids wines\r\nare the richest in this constituent, the amount varying from ·009 gram to\r\n·33 gram per litre. He confirmed Hotter’s statement as to the richness of\r\nfruits in this substance, finding from 1·50–6·40 grams in 1 kgm. of ash.\r\nChrysanthemums and onions, amongst other plants, are well off in this\r\nrespect, containing 2·10–4·60 grams per kgm. of ash. Jay also found that\r\nthe plants vary in their capacity for absorbing boric acid, those which do\r\nso the least easily being Gramineae (as wheat, barley, rice), mushrooms\r\nand watercress, the quantity in these plants never exceeding ·500 grams\r\nper kgm. of ash.\r\n\r\nOf all the workers upon boron, Agulhon has done the most to extend and\r\nconcentrate our knowledge of the subject. He used the most refined,\r\nup-to-date methods for the detection and estimation of boric acid,\r\nand so determined its presence in many plants, including angiosperms,\r\ngymnosperms, ferns, algae, and fungi. Tobacco is so rich in boron that it\r\ncan be detected in the ash of one cigarette. Among the plants tested, the\r\nhighest percentages of boric acid were found in _Betula alba_ (1·175% of\r\nash) and _Laminaria saccharina_ (·682% of ash), the lowest in _Cannabis\r\nsativa_ (·123% of ash). Generally speaking annual plants and parts of\r\nplants seem to have the least boron in the composition of their ashes. In\r\none and the same plant the durable parts like bark and wood are richer\r\nthan the leaves, even in evergreen trees. He indicated that plants seem\r\nto have a great affinity for boron, as even when plants are grown on soils\r\nin which the boron is practically indetectable they always seem to extract\r\nan appreciable quantity of the element.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing results it is evident that boron is very widespread in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, entering into the composition of many plants in all\r\nthe great classes. A general impression obtains that its distribution is\r\nuniversal, and that it will ultimately prove to enter into the composition\r\nof practically every plant, as the scope of the analyses is widened\r\nand as methods of detection are improved. On the other hand, Agulhon is\r\ninclined to think that boron may be a “particular element,” characteristic\r\nof certain groups of individuals or of life under certain conditions.\r\nThe series of individuals differ among themselves as to their particular\r\nneeds of nutriment (in the widest sense) and doubtless each group has\r\nspecial need of particular elements, a need that is possibly correlated\r\nwith morphological and chemical differences. It may well be that boron is\r\none of these elements, associated with certain vital functions in a way\r\nas yet unexplained, though it may possibly be found to play some part in\r\nthe formation of vascular tissues, since it is most abundant in bark and\r\nlignified parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EFFECT OF BORON ON THE GROWTH OF HIGHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Toxic effect._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxic action of boron compounds in water cultures._\r\n\r\nExcessive quantities of boric acid are decidedly poisonous to plants, the\r\naction being well marked in water cultures. Knop (1884) found that free\r\nboric acid was poisonous in neutral food solutions when present at the\r\nrate of ·5 gram per litre, but he was not able to detect boron in the\r\nash of the roots of the experimental plants. Archangeli (1885) placed\r\nseedlings of maize, white lupins, _Vicia sativa_ and _Triticum vulgare_\r\nin solutions of boric acid varying in concentration from 1–·05%, with\r\ncontrols in spring water. In the latter case the development was normal,\r\nwith 1% boric acid the plants were killed, while it was found that the\r\nweaker the solution (within the indicated limits) the stronger the root\r\nand shoot growth.\r\n\r\nHotter (1890) stated that it was known that 1/20,000 boric acid by weight\r\nwas harmful to soy beans in nutritive solutions. He experimented with\r\npeas and maize, placing the seedlings first in distilled water, later\r\nin nutritive solutions. When the peas were nineteen days old they were\r\ntransferred to nutritive solutions containing 1/1000–1/100,000 boric acid\r\nby weight per litre, and within three days the plants with 1/1000 showed\r\nsigns of injury. Two days later all the plants showed signs of poisoning\r\nin that, even with the weakest strengths, the lower leaves were flecked\r\nwith brown, especially at the edges, while with the greater strengths\r\nthe lower leaves were dead and the flecking had extended to the upper\r\nleaves. In eleven days from the start the plants with 1/1000 boric acid\r\nwere completely dead, while the other plants showed more or less signs of\r\npoisoning. The dry matter and ash decreased steadily with the increase\r\nin the boric acid, while the boric acid per 100,000 parts of dry matter\r\nincreased steadily from 8 to 557 parts. Similar experiments were carried\r\non with potassium borate and with borax; the results showed that, weight\r\nfor weight, borax is less toxic than potassium borate, which in turn is\r\nless toxic than boric acid, while at a strength of 1/100,000 there is\r\nlittle to choose between the three poisons. Similar results were obtained\r\nwith maize; plants treated with boric acid or potassium borate yielded\r\nabout 2300 parts boric acid in 100,000 parts dry matter. The general\r\nconclusion arrived at by Hotter was that the effect is not so much that\r\nof a general poisoning as of a bleaching of parts of the leaf, mere\r\ntraces of boron being harmless. The cause of injury is local inhibition\r\nof assimilation and killing of roots in stronger concentrations. Increase\r\nof the strength of boron raises the toxicity until 1/1000 practically\r\ninhibits increase in dry substance. The boron was found to be fairly\r\nevenly distributed through sound and affected organs.\r\n\r\nKahlenberg and True (1896) worked with seedlings of _Lupinus albus_ L.,\r\nlimiting their experiments to those of 15–24 hours in duration. Various\r\ncombinations of boron and other substances were tested. With boric acid\r\nalone 2/25 gram molecule per litre killed the plants, with 1/25 they\r\nwere apparently just alive, while 1/100 and less had no injurious effect.\r\nBoromannitic acid was possibly more poisonous than the boric acid, while\r\na combination of boric acid and cane sugar proved slightly less toxic.\r\nThe short duration of these experiments limited their scope considerably,\r\nas with certain concentrations the toxic action would not become evident\r\nwithin the prescribed limits of time.\r\n\r\nAgulhon (1910 a) worked with sterile nutrient solutions, and found that\r\nthe higher strengths of boric acid hindered growth, 200 mg. boric acid\r\nper litre rendering growth impossible. He supported Hotter’s idea that\r\nthe toxic action affects the roots and the formation of chlorophyll, and\r\nhe stated that the plants are less green as the dose of boron increases,\r\nplants growing in doses of above 10 mg. per litre being yellowish. In\r\nother experiments he found that at 100 mg. boric acid per litre life seems\r\nimpossible for the plant. The roots seem to be more adversely affected by\r\ntoxic doses than do the shoots. In control plants Agulhon determined the\r\nstem/root ratio as 6, with a little boron as 7, while the ratio rose to\r\n13 as the dose of the poison increased to 50–100 mg. boron per litre.\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted experiments show that boric acid is definitely poisonous\r\nto barley down to a strength of 1/250,000 (Fig. 15), the depressing\r\neffect frequently being evident at much smaller concentrations, while\r\npeas can withstand far more of the poison, the limit of toxicity being\r\nabout 1/25–1/50 thousand (Fig. 16). With the greater strengths of poison\r\nthe lower leaves of both barley and peas are badly damaged. In barley\r\nthe leaves turn yellow with big brown spots, giving the leaves a curious,\r\nmottled appearance, while with peas the poisoning seems to begin at the\r\ntip and edge of the leaves, spreading inwards, without, however, showing\r\nthe large spots as in barley. So far as chemical tests go at present, it\r\nis very probable that boron is deposited in the leaves in the same way\r\nas manganese, and that this is the cause of the degeneration. As with\r\nmanganese, the lower leaves are attacked first, and the trouble spreads\r\nupwards, one leaf after another being involved. These observations fit\r\nin very well with those of Hotter, and the hypothesis of direct boron\r\npoisoning gains support from the fact that in dilutions which produce\r\nstimulation of the shoot the leaves show hardly any sign of dying off,\r\neven after prolonged growth in the solutions. With barley the effects of\r\nboron can be seen in the leaves in concentrations as low as 1/2,500,000,\r\nand it may be significant that this is the point at which the depressant\r\naction of boric acid entirely ceases in many cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.

With high concentrations\r\nthe lower leaves of the plant are badly affected, just as with peas and\r\nbarley, turning brown and withering at an early date. Various experiments\r\nhave been made with yellow lupins, but these again are very difficult to\r\ngrow well in water cultures, as they are apt to drop their leaves for no\r\napparent reason. Generally speaking, the evidence goes to prove that boric\r\nacid is toxic down to a concentration of about 500 parts in 25 million.\r\nIt is difficult to get a true control with which to make comparisons\r\nas the plants without boric acid are encumbered with the slime on their\r\nroots, which naturally interferes with normal growth, while the plants in\r\nthe presence of boric acid have the unfair advantage due to the probable\r\nantiseptic action of the boron. The effect of the boron poisoning is again\r\nevident in the dying off of the lower leaves, which become flaccid and\r\ndrooping and finally drop off. The lupins grown with boron are very active\r\nin the putting forth of lateral roots, so much so that the cortex of the\r\nroots is split along the line of emergence of the laterals, which are very\r\nnumerous and crowded.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Toxic action of boron compounds in sand cultures._\r\n\r\nAgulhon (1910 a) moistened 2 kgm. pure sand with 500 c.c. nutritive\r\nsolution for each pot, and boron was added at the rate of 0, 0·1, 1, 10,\r\nand 50 mg. boric acid per litre of nutritive solution. Twenty wheat seeds\r\nwere sown in each pot, and after twelve days the healthy plants in the\r\nfirst four pots were 6–8 cm. high, but those with the maximum amount of\r\nboron showed yellowish leaves only 3 cm. long. After three months’ growth\r\nthe plants were harvested, when those with most boron were found to have\r\ndied after making about 10 cm. growth. The toxic doses in sand proved to\r\nbe weaker than those in water cultures, probably because evaporation from\r\nthe surface of the sand caused concentration of the poisonous liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Toxic action of boron compounds in soil experiments._\r\n\r\nLong before any experimental work was done with boron in water cultures,\r\nthe poisonous properties of the substance were recognised with regard to\r\nplants growing in soil. Peligot (1876) grew haricots in porous earthenware\r\npots, the plants being watered by rain and by solutions, each containing\r\nabout 2 grams per litre of such substances as borax, borate of potassium,\r\nand boric acid, other pots receiving various fertilisers, as potassium\r\nnitrate, sodium nitrate, &c. This quantity of boron completely killed\r\noff the plants receiving it, whether it was applied as free or combined\r\nboric acid, while the fertilised plants completed their development well.\r\nOn this account the deleterious action was attributed to the boric acid\r\nand not to the sodium or potassium base supplied. Peligot hinted at the\r\nimprobability of a substance like boron, which is so poisonous to plants,\r\nbeing really innocuous to human beings when it is used as a preservative\r\nfor foods.\r\n\r\nNakamura (1903) also found that borax is harmful in pot cultures if\r\npresent in large quantities, 50 mg. borax per kgm. of soil exerting a\r\nvery injurious influence, while even 10 mg. per kgm. did some damage.\r\nAgulhon (1910 c) found that the toxic doses of boric acid in soil cultures\r\napproached those in nutritive solutions rather than in sand cultures, a\r\nphenomenon that he attributed to the fact that the boric acid was fixed\r\nby the soil, probably as insoluble borate of calcium, so that the surface\r\nconcentration obtained with sand cultures was avoided. He found that the\r\nash of plants grown with excess of boron contained more than the normal\r\namount of boron, while the weight of ash per 100 dry matter was also\r\nincreased. He concluded that the plant thus suffers an over-mineralisation\r\nand in consequence an augmentation of its hold on water, so that the fresh\r\nweight of the plant may indicate a more favourable action of the boric\r\nacid than does the dry weight. Other investigators (Fliche and Grandeau\r\n1874) had found the same increase in the proportion of ash in chestnut\r\ntrees grown on too calcareous soil, so Agulhon concluded that one is\r\nhere dealing with a general reaction of plants to an excess of a useful\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nOther experiments were carried on in the open field, maize being grown\r\non control plots and on plots receiving 2 gm. boron per square metre.\r\nAt first the latter plants were behind, the dose being too strong.\r\nEventually, however, they pulled up level and the dry weights from the two\r\nplots proved to be nearly the same, the fresh weights being identical.\r\nMaize is evidently far less sensitive to boron poisoning than are peas\r\nand oats, for with these one-half the original amount of boron (= 1 gm.\r\nper sq. metre) proved toxic.\r\n\r\nInteresting results were obtained (Agulhon 1910 a) by repeated experiments\r\nwith the same soil containing boron. It was found that sand or soil\r\ncontaining a proportion of boron which is lethal or toxic to a first\r\nculture will allow much better growth with a second and subsequent\r\ncrops. Repeated experiments on the same soil may show the change from a\r\nlethal dose to a toxic one, thence to an indifferent and finally to an\r\noptimum concentration. Furthermore (Agulhon 1910 b) the very plants may\r\naccustom themselves to greater quantities of boron, the increased power\r\nof resistance being transmitted. He concluded from his experiments that\r\nthe progeny of the second generation of maize were able to withstand\r\nquantities of boron that were toxic to control plants[13]. Agulhon once\r\nagain emphasised the fact that for toxic doses of boron the first symptom\r\nis the more or less marked disappearance of chlorophyll, though the aerial\r\nparts are not affected so soon as the roots.\r\n\r\n    [13] “Il apparaît donc que les graines fournies par des plantes\r\n    ayant crû en présence d’une quantité de bore élevée présentent une\r\n    accoutumance vis-à-vis de cet élément; les plants auxquels elles\r\n    donnent naissance semblent non seulement faire un meilleur emploi\r\n    des petites doses de bore qui leur sont offertes, mais encore\r\n    supportent les doses toxiques plus facilement que les plants\r\n    témoins, issus de graines non accoutumées.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Effect of boron compounds on germination._\r\n\r\nOne of the first indications that boron compounds affect the germination\r\nof seeds was given by Heckel (1875) who found that germination was\r\nretarded for 1–3 days by weak solutions of borates (·25 gm. to 20 gm.\r\nwater), and was stopped altogether by stronger solutions (·60 gm. to 20\r\ngm. water). Archangeli (1885) tested the germination of a variety of seeds\r\nof Leguminosae, Gramineae, and of Cannabis, Iberis, Raphanus, Collinsia,\r\nand Linum in the presence of boric acid. The seeds were placed in bowls\r\nwith solutions of ·25, ·5, and 1% boric acid at temperatures ranging from\r\n16°–23° C. The bowls were covered with glass plates to prevent evaporation\r\nand consequent increase of concentration, controls in spring water being\r\ndealt with under similar conditions. 1% boric acid was found to check\r\ngermination altogether, and the weaker the concentration the less was\r\nthe process hindered. Morel soaked seeds of haricots and wheat in various\r\nsolutions of boric acid, and found that germination was generally hindered\r\nor inhibited. The deleterious action diminishes as the strength of the\r\nsolution or the time of contact diminishes, but solutions of the same\r\nconcentration do not act equally on all seeds. Boric acid and borax proved\r\nto be similar in their action qualitatively.\r\n\r\nThe deleterious effect of strong doses of boric acid on germination was\r\nconfirmed by Agulhon (1910 a), the higher quantities (above 10 mg. boric\r\nacid per litre) retarding germination of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Does boron stimulate higher plants?_\r\n\r\nOf recent years a few investigators have thrown out hints as to the\r\nstimulant action exerted by boron compounds on plants. Roxas indicated\r\nthat M/100,000 (M = molecular weight) of boric acid exercised a favourable\r\naction on rice. Nakamura (1903) tested the point by means of pot cultures.\r\nPeas and spinach plants were grown in soil which received 1 and 5 mg.\r\nborax per kgm. With peas the 1 mg. exerted evident stimulant action,\r\nas determined by the increase in height of the shoot over that of the\r\ncontrol, 5 mg. seeming to be slightly depressant in action. With spinach\r\na stimulation was observed both in weight and height with a dose of 5 mg.\r\nborax per kgm.\r\n\r\n                  Average weight      Average length of leaves\r\n    5 mg. borax        10·35                    38·2\r\n    Control             7·2                     34·0\r\n\r\nAgulhon (1910 c and d) took the matter up still more definitely and made\r\nmany tests of various kinds, in water, sand and pot cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Water cultures._\r\n\r\nHis water cultures were made under sterile conditions, the seeds when\r\npossible being sterilised with corrosive sublimate, the germinating\r\napparatus being also sterilised. With wheat a stimulant action was\r\nevident, maximum growth being obtained with between 2·5 and 10 mg. boric\r\nacid per litre, though the dry weight increase did not quite keep pace\r\nwith that of the fresh weight, a fact to which previous reference has been\r\nmade. The chief improvement is in the root, the stem/root ratio falling to\r\n5, as against 6 in the control series. Visual observation indicated that\r\nthe roots of plants receiving 5–10 mg. boric acid per litre are longer\r\nthan the others, though they are less rich in adventitious roots. The\r\nincreased dry weight due to boron may amount to as much as 30%.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Sand cultures._\r\n\r\nAgulhon again observed stimulation in this case. 2 kgm. of sand were\r\nmoistened with 500 c.c. nutritive solution, varying quantities of boric\r\nacid being added in addition. ·1 mg. boric acid per litre of N.S. (·05\r\nmg. per pot) gave an increase of 25% fresh weight, and 7·5% dry weight.\r\nThe stimulating doses seem to be weaker than in the experiments with\r\nliquid media, probably because the evaporation from the sand increases\r\nthe concentration of the boric acid at the surface. It was also noticed\r\nthat the increase of weight varied in experiments made at different times.\r\nWith oats the stimulating influence is greater than with wheat, showing\r\nthat some plants are more sensitive than others to the influence of boron.\r\nWith radish 1 mg. boric acid per litre exercised a stimulating effect,\r\nthe enormous average increase of 61% in fresh weight occurring with this\r\nstrength, though this only represented an average increase of 9·6% dry\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Soil cultures._\r\n\r\nHere again the stimulating action was evident with higher concentrations\r\nthan in sand cultures, and Agulhon obtained good results with strengths\r\nthat are toxic in sand. The evaporation from earth is not so rapid as from\r\nsand, so that the concentration is not increased, and also some of the\r\nboric acid is withdrawn from the solution by interaction with the soil,\r\nso that the stimulating concentration rises in the scale.\r\n\r\nIn field experiments Agulhon found that peas were more sensitive to the\r\ntoxic action of boric acid than is maize. A strength of boric acid (= 1\r\ngm. B per sq. metre) that poisoned peas, gave an increase of 61% fresh\r\nweight and 39% dry weight with maize; half the strength proved to be\r\nindifferent for peas, the improvement with maize equalling 56% increase\r\nfresh and 50% increase dry. Curiously enough, judging by appearances in\r\nthe first experiment, an unfavourable influence was at work, though in\r\nreality a great stimulation was being caused. Colza gave a good increase\r\nwith similar strengths, but with turnips 1 gm. B per sq. metre only\r\nfavoured the aerial parts, while ·5 gm. B per sq. metre only increased\r\nroot development. Agulhon concluded that it is as yet impossible to\r\ndetermine with any precision the exact part that boron plays in the plant\r\neconomy. He suggests that boron is a “particulier” element characteristic\r\nof a certain group of individuals or of life under particular conditions.\r\nIn his summary he argues that each series of individuals adapted to\r\ndifferent environments has doubtless need of particular elements, and that\r\nperhaps chemical causes and morphological differences are very closely\r\nconnected. Boron may be of this “particulier élément” type in the higher\r\nplants of the vegetable kingdom, and it may be useful commercially as a\r\nmanurial agent, the “catalytic manure” of Bertrand and Agulhon.\r\n\r\nWhile the higher concentrations of boric acid proved definitely toxic\r\nto both peas and barley in the Rothamsted water cultures, some evidence\r\nof stimulation was obtained with the lower strengths. With barley the\r\nquestion of stimulation is still an open one, as below the toxic limit\r\ngrowth seems fairly level in most of the experimental series. The lower\r\nlimit of toxicity varies from 40–4 parts boric acid per 10,000,000\r\naccording to circumstances. Below this critical concentration the boric\r\nacid has apparently no action, either depressant or stimulant, unless the\r\nstimulation should prove to begin at a dilution of 1/50,000,000, but the\r\nevidence on this point is not sufficiently well marked or consistent to be\r\nconclusive. This failure to detect stimulation was somewhat unexpected, as\r\nwhen judged by the eye the plants treated with the lower concentrations\r\nof boric acid seemed better than the controls, and also exhibited a\r\nparticularly healthy green colouration.\r\n\r\nPeas on the other hand are definitely stimulated with traces of boric\r\nacid, concentrations of 1/100,000 and less causing an improvement in\r\ngrowth, while under some experimental conditions even higher amounts\r\nof boric acid were beneficial. All the stimulated plants showed the\r\ncharacteristic dark green colour which seems to be associated with\r\nthe presence of minute traces of boron in the nutritive solution. An\r\ninteresting morphological feature was the strong development of small side\r\nshoots from the base of the plants in the presence of medium amounts of\r\nboric acid, from 1 part in 100,000 downwards. This gave rise to a certain\r\nbushiness of growth, which was less evident as the concentration of the\r\nstimulant decreased. The general outcome of the tests seems to be that\r\nboric acid needs to be supplied in relatively great strength to be fatal\r\nto pea plants, and that the toxic action gives place to a stimulative one\r\nhigh up in the scale of concentration. As far as experiments have already\r\ngone it seems as though the stimulation is not a progressive one, as the\r\neffect of 1/100,000 boric acid is as good as that of 1/20,000,000, a flat\r\ncurve connecting the two. This, however, needs confirmation.\r\n\r\nYellow lupins also give some evidence of stimulation with concentrations\r\nof about 1/50,000 boric acid, the improvement being far more strongly\r\nmarked in some sets of experiments than in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EFFECT OF BORON COMPOUNDS ON CERTAIN OF THE LOWER PLANTS.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the action of boron on the lower plants is less definite\r\nand complete than with regard to the higher plants. Morel (1892) found\r\nthat boric acid acts as a strong poison to the lower fungi and similar\r\norganisms, their development being completely arrested by very weak\r\nsolutions of the acid. He suggested, on this account, that boric acid\r\nmight be used in the same way as copper to attack such diseases as mildew,\r\nanthracnose, &c., which attack useful plants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Loew (1892) stated that such algae as _Spirogyra_\r\nand _Vaucheria_ showed no harmful influence for many weeks when the\r\nculture water contained as much as ·2% (= 1/500) boric acid. This may\r\nbe supplemented by a recent observation at Rothamsted, in which certain\r\nunicellular green algae (unidentified), were found growing at the bottom\r\nof a stoppered bottle containing a stock solution of 1/100 boric acid.\r\n\r\nAgulhon (1910 a) dealt chiefly with yeasts and certain ferments, and found\r\nthat yeasts grown in culture solutions are not influenced favourably or\r\nunfavourably by relatively large quantities of boric acid up to 1 gram\r\nper litre, while all development is checked with 10 grams per litre. The\r\npresence of boron affects the action of yeast on glucose and galactose.\r\nGalactose alone is not attacked even after 40 days in the presence of ·66%\r\nboric acid. When glucose is mixed with the galactose the latter is said\r\nto be at first left untouched, but later it disappears very slowly.\r\n\r\nBoric acid exercises an antiseptic action on lactic ferments, 5 gm.\r\nper litre checking their action sufficiently to enable milk to remain\r\nuncoagulated. Lactic acid is still produced even with as much boric acid\r\nas 10 gm. per litre. The microbe is not actually killed by the boric acid,\r\nbut its development is so arrested that reproduction cannot take place.\r\nThe same phenomenon was observed with yeast. With moulds again, while no\r\nstimulation could be obtained with small quantities of boric acid, yet\r\nthe toxic action does not begin to set in until 5 gm. boric acid per litre\r\nare present.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that such lower organisms as yeast, lactic ferment and\r\n_Aspergillus niger_ are remarkably indifferent to the action of boric\r\nacid, as is shown by the fact that the toxic dose is remarkably high,\r\nwhile stimulation effects cannot be observed even in the presence of the\r\nsmallest quantities yet tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nBoric acid is less harmful to the growth of higher plants than are the\r\ncompounds of copper, zinc, and arsenic. Evidence exists that below a\r\ncertain limit of concentration boron exercises a favourable influence upon\r\nplant growth, encouraging the formation of stronger roots and shoots. This\r\nstimulation is more strongly marked with some species than with others,\r\npeas responding more readily than barley to the action of boric acid.\r\nFungi are very indifferent to boron, whether it is present in large or\r\nsmall quantities, and there is evidence to show that certain of the green\r\nalgae can also withstand large quantities of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF MANGANESE COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF MANGANESE IN PLANTS\r\n\r\nThe presence of manganese as a constituent of plant tissues has been known\r\nfor many years, and in view of the close association between iron and\r\nmanganese it was natural that the early investigators should seek for the\r\nlatter element. De Saussure (1804) gives one of the earliest references to\r\nmanganese in plant ash, stating that it occurs in the seeds in less great\r\nproportion than in the stems, and also that the leaves of trees contain\r\nless in autumn than in spring. At first oxides of iron and manganese\r\nwere put together as “metallic oxides” and little or no attempt was made\r\nto separate them so as to get an idea of their relative abundance. John\r\n(1814) gives a number of rough analyses of plants and indicates the\r\npresence of manganese in many plants, including _Solanum tuberosum_,\r\n_Brassica oleracea viridis_ L., _Conium maculatum_, _Aesculus_ (in outer\r\nbark), and _Arundo Sacchar_. No further references presented themselves\r\nuntil 1847, as probably manganese was overlooked and always classed with\r\niron in any analyses made during that time. Kane (1847) found traces of\r\nmanganese in the ashes of some samples of flax, but none in others, and\r\nexaminations of the soils on which the plants were grown gave similar\r\nresults. Mayer and Brazier (1849) confirmed this result. Herapath (1849)\r\nanalysed the ashes of various culinary vegetables, finding manganese in\r\ncauliflowers, swede turnips, beetroot, and in one variety of potato (Forty\r\nfold).\r\n\r\nMalaguti and Durocher (1858) tried to investigate the matter\r\nquantitatively. The oxides of iron, manganese, and aluminium were all\r\nclassed together, and the mean percentage of the three varied from\r\n·85%–5·06% according to the varieties of plants concerned, Cruciferae\r\npossessing least and Leguminosae most. Different mean results with the\r\nsame plant were obtained from different soils.\r\n\r\nWolff (1871) made other quantitative analyses including _Trapa natans_\r\n(·15% Mn₃O₄), _Acorus Calamus_ (1·52% Mn₃O₄), _Alnus incana_ (trace–·73%\r\nMn₃O₄), _Pyrus communis_ (2·15% Mn₃O₄). Many other plants were mentioned\r\nby Wolff as containing manganese.\r\n\r\nCampani (1876) found manganese in ash by a method in which it was detected\r\nas phosphate of manganese, and he claimed to be the first to discover\r\nmanganese in wheat ash. Warden (1878) found traces of Mn₃O₄ in the ash of\r\nopium from Behar.\r\n\r\nDunnington (1878) detected manganese in the ash of wheat, ·00144 gm. (as\r\nMn₃O₄?) in 300 grams of “Dark Lancaster” variety, equivalent to ·027% of\r\nthe pure ash. The ash was exhausted with nitric acid, and after separating\r\nthe iron the ammonium sulphide precipitate was found to contain manganese,\r\nand gave by fusion with nitre and sodium phosphate a violet coloured mass.\r\nAndreasch (1878) found slight traces of Mn₃O₄ in the flowers of _Dianthus\r\ncaryophyllus_, none occurring elsewhere, while in _Rosa remontana_ it\r\nappeared in both leaves and flowers.\r\n\r\nMaumené (1884) tested many food plants and concluded that some quantity\r\nof manganese is frequently present in potato, rice, barley, carrot,\r\nlentil, pea, beetroot, asparagus, chicory, most fruits, tea, and also in\r\nsome fodder plants, as lucerne, oats, and sainfoin. Ricciardi (1889),\r\nHattensaur (1891) also added to the list of plants proved to contain\r\nmanganese. Guerin (1897) studied the manganese content of woody tissues.\r\nSawdust was treated with distilled water containing 1% caustic potash,\r\nexpressed, and filtered after two or three days. A brown coloured liquid\r\nwas obtained, which when treated with a slight excess of hydrochloric acid\r\ngave an abundant flocculent precipitate. This precipitate proved to be\r\nsoluble in pure water, so it was washed with slightly acidulated distilled\r\nwater, and after further purification was analysed. No trace of iron was\r\nobtained, but about ·402% Mn was found. Guerin regarded the precipitate\r\nas a “nucleinic” combination, which he supposed to occur generally in wood\r\nand to contain the manganese present in the woody tissues of all plants.\r\n\r\nSchlagdenhauffen and Reeb (1904) detected manganese in a petrol extract\r\nof such cereals as barley, oats, and maize, and since inorganic salts\r\nof manganese are not soluble in such liquids as ether or petrol they\r\nconcluded that the manganese must be present in the plant in organic\r\ncombination, thereby upholding Guerin’s view. Loew and Seiroku Honda\r\n(1904) give a table of Mn₃O₄ in the ashes of certain trees. This is very\r\nhigh in some cases, rising to 11·25% in the ash of beech leaves, 6·73% in\r\nbirch leaves, and 5·48% in chestnut fruits.\r\n\r\nGössl (1905) gives lists of the distribution of manganese in plants, both\r\nThallophytes and Phanerogams, indicating the presence of much or little of\r\nthe element. As a rule, he states, marsh and water plants gather up more\r\nmanganese than do land plants.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms seem to be particularly rich in their manganese content.\r\nSchröder (1878) tested for the element in firs and pines and found the\r\nfollowing amounts of Mn₃O₄.\r\n\r\n    In 100 parts ash.    In 1000 parts dry matter.\r\n       Fir    Pine             Fir     Pine\r\n      33·18  13·46             2·76     ·77\r\n\r\nHe gave a table of detailed analyses showing the differing proportions of\r\nmanganese in the different parts of the fir.\r\n\r\nBaker and Smith (1910) paid special attention to manganese in their\r\nexhaustive work on the Pines of Australia. They state that “in the\r\nanatomical investigations of the timber, bark, and leaves of the various\r\nspecies, there was found to be present, in a more or less degree, a\r\nnaturally brownish-bronze coloured substance, which invariably stained\r\ndark brown or almost black with haematoxylin.” This substance on careful\r\ninvestigation proved to be a compound of manganese. The quantity present\r\nvaries with the species and also with the plant organs. The different\r\nspecies of the genus Callitris show variable percentages of manganese\r\nfrom a maximum of 0·230% in _C. gracilis_, to a minimum of 0·010% in _C.\r\nrobusta_. The percentage of manganese in Australian Coniferae other than\r\nCallitris is given by the authors in the following table:\r\n\r\n    Ash of timber of Agathis robusta                 0·145% Mn.\r\n     „       „       Araucaria Cunninghamii          0·054%  „\r\n     „       „       Araucaria Bidwilli              0·077%  „\r\n     „       „       Actinostrobus pyramidalis       0·077%  „\r\n     „       „       Podocarpus elata                0·002%  „\r\n     „       „       Dacrydium Franklini             0·129%  „\r\n     „       „       Athrotaxis selaginoides         0·019%  „\r\n     „       „       Phyllocladus rhomboidalis       0·145%  „\r\n    Air-dried black gum of Agathis robusta           0·0046% „\r\n        „           „      Araucaria Cunninghamii    0·0038% „\r\n\r\nBaker and Smith assume that manganese is essential to the production\r\nof the most complete growth of Coniferae. The element is found in these\r\nplants even when they grow on soils containing only traces of manganese\r\nand it is suggested that possibly the excess or deficiency of manganese\r\nin the soil helps to govern the location of certain of the Australian\r\nConiferae. The authors conclude that manganese may be essential to the\r\ngrowth of these plants, and that its association with plant life may be\r\nconsidered to date back to past geological time, as is indicated by plates\r\nillustrating fossil woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EFFECT OF MANGANESE ON THE GROWTH OF HIGHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Toxic effect._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxic action of manganese compounds in the presence of soluble\r\nnutrients._\r\n\r\nLittle work seems to have been done on the action of manganese compounds\r\nin water cultures. Knop (1884) just indicated that manganese compounds had\r\nno effect on maize, but gave no details. Japanese investigators touched\r\non the matter in the course of their extensive experiments with this\r\nelement. Asō (1902) found that the greater concentrations of manganese\r\nsulphate exercised an injurious influence on barley. Even in solutions\r\nwith as little as ·002% manganese sulphate (= 1/50,000 MnSO₄) the roots\r\ngradually turned brown, the lower leaves following suit. The brown colour\r\nwas concentrated at certain points of the leaves, and microscopical\r\nexamination showed that the membranes of the epidermal cells, and in some\r\ncases the nuclei, were stained deeply brown. The greatest concentration\r\nendured by barley without injury seemed to be about ·01 per 1000 =\r\n1/100,000. The presence of iron in the food solutions seems to counteract\r\nthe effect of the manganese to some extent by delaying the yellowing of\r\nthe leaves. Wheat proved very similar to barley in its reactions, though\r\nmore iron is necessary to give good healthy growth. Asō states that\r\nwheat is able to overcome the injurious action of manganese much more\r\nreadily than is barley. With peas the yellowing of the leaves was delayed,\r\nprobably on account of a sufficient supply of iron in the reserve stores\r\nof the seeds.\r\n\r\nLoew and Sawa (1902) found that ·25% = 1/400 MnSO₄ (anhydrous) kills pea\r\nplants within five days and that the green colour is gradually affected\r\nwith more dilute solutions. Barley and soy beans were grown in nutritive\r\nsolutions with either iron sulphate or manganese sulphate or both (·01%\r\nFeSO₄, ·02% MnSO₄, ·01% FeSO₄ + ·02% MnSO₄). At first the growth was\r\nincreased by the action of two salts together, but eventually the shoots\r\nturned yellowish, and assimilation was depressed, so that decreased\r\nnutrition led to relaxation in the speed of growth, indicating the toxic\r\naction due to the manganese sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted experiments supported Asō’s work on the action of manganese\r\nsulphate on barley, concentrations of the salt above 1/100,000 having a\r\nretarding influence on the growth, the roots being coloured brown and\r\nthe leaves also showing discolouration. At an early stage in growth\r\nthe lower leaves of the plants receiving the most poison began to be\r\nflecked with brown spots, which were at first attributed to an attack\r\nof rust. Suspicion was soon aroused, however, and a closer microscopic\r\ninvestigation showed that no disease was present, but that the cells\r\nin the affected spots were dead and brown, though they retained their\r\nshape. The dead cells at first occurred in small patches, which spread\r\nand coalesced until ultimately the whole leaf was involved. Some of the\r\naffected leaves were detached and fused with a mixture of sodium carbonate\r\nand potassium nitrate. On dissolving up the resulting mass with water\r\na green colouration was obtained, indicating the presence of manganese\r\nin the leaves. This shows that the manganese is taken up by the roots,\r\ntransferred to the leaves and then deposited in them, the lower leaves\r\nbeing the first affected.\r\n\r\nThe presence of manganese in the nutritive solution retarded the ripening\r\nof the grain to some extent, as when the grains from the control plants\r\nwere hard and ripe, those from plants treated with 1/10,000 MnSO₄ were\r\ngreen, those with 1/100,000 were a mixture of ripe, half-ripe, and green\r\ngrains, while plants which had received 1/1,000,000 MnSO₄ possessed ripe\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nPeas give similar results to barley so far as the vegetative growth is\r\nconcerned, the same retardation with the higher concentrations being\r\nobserved, while the brown discoloured patches in the lower leaves are\r\nmuch in evidence. All traces of manganese in the leaves disappear when the\r\nconcentration falls to 1/250,000. On the whole peas are more sensitive to\r\nmanganese poisoning than is barley, and the higher strengths of manganese\r\nprove more deleterious to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Toxic action of manganese compounds in sand cultures._\r\n\r\nLittle work has been done on this aspect of the problem. Prince de Salm\r\nHorstmar (1851) grew oats in sand with various combinations of nitrogenous\r\nsubstances and inorganic mineral salts. He stated that until the time of\r\nfruit formation manganese does not seem to be essential to the oat unless\r\niron is in excess in the substratum.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Toxic action of manganese compounds in soil cultures._\r\n\r\nA large body of work has been done with manganese in soil cultures, but\r\nthe toxic effect is hardly indicated, possibly because it is less manifest\r\nunder soil conditions, possibly because the observation of the toxic\r\naction has been almost completely overshadowed by the interest in the\r\nstimulation observed under the same circumstances. Namba stated that ·5\r\ngm. MnSO₄ added to 8 kgm. Japanese soil exerted a depressing influence\r\non the growth of various plants. The Hills Experiments (1903) indicated\r\nsome toxic effect. Various soluble and insoluble salts of manganese were\r\nadded to soil in pots at the rate of 2 cwt. per acre, wheat being sown.\r\nOn the whole the plants from untreated pots were as good as any with\r\nmanganese except those that received manganese nitrate or phosphate.\r\nManganese iodide distinctly retarded growth. The plants that grew did well\r\neventually, but development of the ear was greatly or entirely retarded.\r\nIf the seeds were soaked in the iodide, a concentration of 10% was found\r\nto be harmful, 5% allowing normal growth. Similar experiments with barley\r\nshowed that plants treated with manganese carbonate and sulphate were both\r\ninferior to the untreated plants; with iodide less plants were obtained\r\nand their development was abnormal. Soaking the seeds in the iodide, even\r\nin 10% solution, did not do damage as it did with wheat. The oxides were\r\napparently innocuous, but gave no increase either in corn or straw.\r\n\r\nKelley (1909) found that on soils in Hawaii in which excessive quantities\r\nof manganese are present (5·61% Mn₃O₄) pineapples do not flourish,\r\nbut turn yellow and produce poor fruits, and also that if rather less\r\nmanganese is present (1·36% Mn₃O₄) the pineapples show the toxic effect\r\nby yellowing during the winter months, but they recover completely during\r\nthe hot summer months. Kelley also observed that the deleterious effect is\r\nhardly noticeable during the first twelve months of growth, and that after\r\na time a darkening occurs in the colour of the soil, which he attributes\r\nto some change in the constitution of the manganese compounds.\r\n\r\nSome interesting observations were made by Guthrie and Cohen (1910) on\r\ncertain Australian soils. A bowling green that was initially covered with\r\na healthy mat of couch grass developed a number of small patches after\r\nabout three years growth, on which the grass died off. No reason was\r\napparent for this phenomenon, as the cultural conditions were uniform and\r\nto all appearances the soil over the whole area was similar in character.\r\nAnalyses of soil samples from the dead patches and from the neighbouring\r\nhealthy parts of the green showed that the chemical composition in both\r\ncases was practically the same, except that while no manganese occurred in\r\nthe soil from the unharmed part, as much as ·254% Mn₂O₃ was found in that\r\nfrom the dead patches. As no other differences were found it was argued\r\nthat the manganese, present in such large quantities, acted as a toxic\r\nagent and killed off the grass. Other instances of manganese poisoning\r\nin which wheat and barley were affected are quoted by these authors, the\r\nanalytical results indicating that possibly barley is able to withstand\r\nwithout injury a greater quantity of manganese compounds in the soil than\r\nis wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Effect of manganese compounds on germination._\r\n\r\nNazari (1910) rolled wheat grains in a paste of manganese dioxide,\r\niron sesquioxide (both with and without organic matter), and in what he\r\nterms “artificial oxydases.” The seeds rolled in the last-named showed\r\nthe greatest energy in germination, while those with manganese gave\r\nan appreciable acceleration. The presence of organic matter decreased\r\nthe action of manganese. The plants from the manganese seedlings gave\r\nan increased yield in both straw and grain, while those treated with\r\nsesquioxide of iron showed no gain over the check plants.\r\n\r\nThe Hills Experiments yielded some information as to the differing effects\r\nof various compounds of manganese on germination. With wheat plants in\r\npot experiments manganese oxide (MnO₂) distinctly retarded germination\r\nwhen applied at the rate of 2 cwt. per acre. With barley MnO₂, manganese\r\ncarbonate and sulphate all retarded germination, while with the iodide\r\n50% of the seeds were entirely prevented from germinating.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Does manganese stimulate higher plants?_\r\n\r\nWith manganese the evidence in favour of stimulation is more weighty than\r\nwith such poisons as copper, zinc and arsenic, and the literature on the\r\nsubject is correspondingly plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Stimulation in water cultures._\r\n\r\nWhile Asō (1902) asserted that plants can develope normally in water\r\ncultures in the absence of any trace of manganese, he further stated that\r\nmanganese compounds exercise both an injurious and a stimulant action on\r\nplants. With increasing dilution of the compound the deleterious action\r\ndiminishes, while the stimulant action increases, and a dilution can be\r\nreached in which only the favourable influence of the manganese becomes\r\nobvious. The addition of ·002% manganese sulphate (= 1/50,000) to culture\r\nsolutions stimulated radish, barley, wheat and peas. The intensity of the\r\ncolour reaction of the oxidising enzyme of the manganese plants was found\r\nto exceed that of the control plants, at least with regard to those leaves\r\non the manganese plants which had turned a yellowish colour.\r\n\r\nLoew and Sawa (1902) obtained an initial increase of growth with\r\nbarley and soy beans in nutritive solutions + ·01% ferrous sulphate +\r\n·02% manganese sulphate, but this initial stimulation was followed by\r\ndepression. These authors support Asō’s contention that manganese exerts\r\nboth an injurious and a stimulative action upon plants, and that the\r\npromoting effect is still observable with manganese compounds in high\r\ndilution, while the injurious effects disappear under this condition.\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted experiments with barley show a decided stimulation with\r\n1/100,000 MnSO₄ and less. Care was taken to utilise sublimed FeCl₃\r\nto avoid error due to the introduction of manganese into the control\r\nsolution through the agency of this salt. It is interesting to notice that\r\nconcentrations that are weak enough to stimulate the vegetative growth\r\nstill show a depressing action in that they retard the ripening of the\r\ngrain, a fact which supports Loew and Sawa’s contention that manganese\r\nexerts both a toxic and a stimulative action at one and the same time, the\r\nbalance showing itself according to the concentration (Fig. 17). In the\r\nlater experiments the plants were not allowed to form ears, but similar\r\nresults were obtained, except that when dealing with the vegetative growth\r\nonly, a definite stimulus was obtained with a higher concentration than in\r\nthose experiments in which the plants were allowed to form seed. This may\r\nor may not be significant, as it is possible that seasonal variation and\r\nindividuality of the plants may have played some part. Barley seems to be\r\nmost extraordinarily sensitive to the action of manganese, as even 1 part\r\nin 100,000,000 was found to exercise a beneficial action (Fig. 18). With\r\npeas the evidence of stimulus is less well marked. No sign of stimulation\r\nis obtained until a greater dilution is reached than is necessary with\r\nbarley. Even so the resulting curves are not sufficiently conclusive to\r\nwarrant the definite statement that manganese does act as a stimulant to\r\npeas when present in very small quantities (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.

The criterion\r\nof stimulation was the length of the growing leaves as measured daily,\r\na strength of M/1000 MnSO₄ (M = molecular weight) giving a favourable\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn the Hills Experiments (1903) an increase of produce was obtained\r\nwith wheat by manuring with manganese phosphate, chloride, sulphate, or\r\noxide (MnO₂), while an increase of straw was gained with nitrate, though\r\nthis compound decreased the yield of corn. With barley no evidence of\r\nstimulation is set forth for any compound, except that the root growth\r\nwas improved by the addition of manganese iodide, in spite of the general\r\nunfavourable action this substance exerted upon germination and growth.\r\n\r\nBertrand (1905) whose work will later be considered in detail,\r\nexperimented on arable land, adding quantities of manganese sulphate (?)\r\nequivalent to about 1·6 gm. Mn to each square metre, growing oats from\r\nFebruary to May. Increase of weight was found in the plants growing on\r\nthe manganese plots, the differences in favour of manganese being\r\n\r\n    For total crops  22·5%.\r\n     „ grain only    17·4%.\r\n     „ straw only    26·0%.\r\n\r\nA certain alteration in the quality of the grain was also noted from\r\nthe manganese plots, the weight per hectolitre exceeding that from the\r\nuntreated plot, the % of water and of total nitrogen being somewhat lower\r\nthan that from the untreated, while the ash and the quantity of manganese\r\npresent was the same in the grain from both plots. Bertrand suggested\r\nthat these results might indicate a new line to follow in the study of\r\nthe causes of the soil fertility.\r\n\r\nStrampelli (1907) tested the effect of manganese dioxide, carbonate,\r\nand sulphate, and of a manganiferous mineral from the Argentine upon\r\nwheat, and found that while all four substances exercised a favourable\r\ninfluence on the vegetation, the best result was obtained with the\r\nsulphate. When however other manures were used in conjunction with the\r\nmanganese compounds the balance of improvement shifted. With nitrogen,\r\napplied as nitrate of soda, manganese dioxide proved the most beneficial,\r\nwith farmyard manure the manganiferous mineral[14], and with blood the\r\ncarbonate. It was also found that a manganese compost did not increase\r\nproduction when phosphatic manure was applied as basic slag.\r\n\r\n    [14] As no analysis of the mineral is given it is obviously\r\n    impossible to say to what constituent the increase is due in this\r\n    case.\r\n\r\nFeilitzen (1907) indicated that the nature of the soil plays its part in\r\ndetermining whether manganese acts as a stimulant or not. His experiments\r\nwere made in the field on poor moor soil, which carried a little Sphagnum\r\nturf and Eriophorum, and which was poor in food salts. The soil was\r\nprepared and manured and then the plots were watered with a solution of ·1\r\ngm. MnSO₄.4H₂O per litre at the rate of 10 kgm. sulphate per hectare, six\r\ncontrol plots being left untreated. Oats were sown and the soil rolled.\r\nDuring growth no difference was noted between the various plots, and after\r\nharvesting the weights of the different crops showed that the manganese\r\nhad not caused increase of crop in either grain or straw on this poor moor\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the work on this problem has been carried out by various\r\nJapanese investigators, whose work extends over several years. Loew and\r\nSawa (1902) found that small quantities of manganese sulphate in soil\r\ncultures stimulated the growth of rice, pea, and cabbage. They suggested\r\nthat soils of great natural fertility contain manganese in an easily\r\nabsorbed condition, and that this forms one of the characteristics of such\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nNagaoka (1903) dealt with plots in the rice fields which had not been\r\nmanured for the three previous years and which were then treated with\r\nmanure at the rate of 100 kgm. ammonium sulphate, 100 kgm. potassium\r\ncarbonate and 100 kgm. double superphosphate per hectare. Twelve series\r\nwere worked in triplicate and received manganese sulphate in varying\r\nquantities, equivalent to 0–55 kgm. Mn₂O₃ per hectare, one set of three\r\nbeing left untreated. The cultivation was normal and the application of\r\nmanganese was found to influence the yield of rice. 25 kgm. per hectare\r\ngave the best result and increased the harvest of grains by one-third;\r\nhigher doses of Mn₂O₃ gave no better crop. The percentage of grain\r\nrelative to the straw was also increased. The increase in both respects\r\nwas evident all through the series from 10 to 55 kgm. Mn₂O₃ per hectare.\r\nThe conclusion was reached that the application of this salt to soils poor\r\nin manganese would be a commercial advantage.\r\n\r\nThe next year (1904) the experiments were extended to observe the after\r\neffects of the initial doses of manganese sulphate. The harvest of grain\r\nwas greatest in those plots that had received 30 kgm. Mn₂O₃ per hectare,\r\nwhile it was approached very closely by that from the plot with 25 kgm.\r\nMn₂O₃, which had proved the best in the first year’s experiments. The\r\nmaximum increase of yield over the unmanured plots in the first year was\r\n37%, while in the second year it dropped to 16·9%.\r\n\r\nAsō (1904) also obtained an increase of one-third in produce of grain when\r\n25 kgm. Mn₃O₄ per hectare (as manganous chloride) was applied to rice.\r\nThe development of the plants was improved and the treated plants flowered\r\nabout four days before the untreated ones.\r\n\r\nLoew and Honda (1904) grew _Cryptomeria japonica_ in beds, treating the\r\nsoil with various manures and with iron or manganese sulphate. The latter\r\nfavoured increase in height, and within 1½ years the cubic content of the\r\ntrees had increased to double.\r\n\r\nFukutome (1904) grew flax in pot cultures, each pot containing 8 kgm.\r\nsoil, to which was added ·4 gm. MnCl₂.4H₂O and ·4 gm. FeSO₄.7H₂O. This\r\nmixture had a marked effect on the growth of the flax, but the individual\r\nsalts in doses of ·4 gm. per 8 kgm. soil had but little effect.\r\n\r\nNamba (1908) applied manganese salts to onion plants in pots with a\r\nconsiderable measure of success. Pots containing 8 kgm. loamy soil were\r\nmanured and received:\r\n\r\n    (1)  no manganese,\r\n    (2)  ·1 gm. MnSO₄.4H₂O,\r\n    (3)  ·2 gm. MnSO₄.4H₂O,\r\n\r\nthe manganese sulphate being applied in high dilution as top dressing. The\r\nbulbs and leaves were considerably stimulated by small doses of manganese\r\nsulphate, the best results being obtained from (2), which represents a\r\nmanuring of 22 kgm. MnSO₄ per hectare. An increase of the dose lessens\r\nthe beneficial effect, as the toxic action begins to come into play. The\r\nactual figures obtained may prove of interest.\r\n\r\n    Wt. leaves  Wt. bulbs    Total weight         Bulbs & roots\r\n                & roots   Absolute   Relative     _____________\r\n                                                     leaves\r\n         gm.       gm.        gm.        gm.\r\n    1.  29·5       8·5       38·0      100·0           ·28\r\n    2.  38·0      22·5       60·5      159·2           ·59\r\n    3.  35·5      16·5       51·0      134·2           ·46\r\n\r\nUchiyama (1907) carried on a variety of experiments with manganese\r\nsulphate on several plants on different soils, both in the field and in\r\npots, and found that the compound exercised a favourable action in most\r\ncases when applied in appropriate quantities. In summarising his results\r\nhe stated that both manganese and iron stimulate the development of\r\nplants, different plants varying in their susceptibility to the action.\r\nSometimes a joint application of the two salts is the most beneficial,\r\nsometimes an individual application is the better, in which case manganese\r\nsulphate is generally better than ferric sulphate in its action. The\r\nstimulating action of manganese varies greatly with the character of the\r\nsoil, and the mode of application also affects results. As a general rule\r\nthe manganese acts best when applied as a top dressing rather than when\r\nadded together with the manure. Further the stimulating action differs\r\ngreatly with the nature and reaction of the manurial mixture. Uchiyama\r\nconcludes that 20–50 kgm. per hectare of crystallised manganese sulphate\r\nis a good general amount to apply.\r\n\r\nTakeuchi (1909) corroborates the statements of the various writers that\r\nplants differ in their response to the manganese manuring. Pot cultures,\r\nin each of which 8 kgm. soil were similarly manured, received ·2 gm.\r\nMnSO₄.4H₂O applied as a solution of 1/100 strength, the controls receiving\r\nthe same amount of water. The manganese increased the green weight of\r\nspinach by 41%, while the dry weight of barley, peas and flax rose 5·3%,\r\n19·4%, and 13·9% respectively above that of the untreated. The control\r\nplants of flax were behind the manganese plants in growth and flowering,\r\nwhile barley was the least stimulated of all the test-plants. Other\r\nobservations seemed to show that Leguminosae and Cruciferae are more\r\nsusceptible to manganese stimulation than are the Gramineae.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EFFECT OF MANGANESE COMPOUNDS ON CERTAIN OF THE LOWER PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe information on this point is exceedingly meagre, possibly because of\r\nthe diversion of general attention to the higher plants in view of the\r\ncommercial interests involved.\r\n\r\nRichards (1897) carried out experiments with various nutritive media\r\nwith the addition of certain metallic salts, including those of zinc,\r\niron, aluminium and manganese. The fungi tested were _Aspergillus niger_,\r\n_Penicillium glaucum_ and _Botrytis cinerea_. His general conclusion was\r\nthat fungi may be stimulated, though it must not be concluded without\r\nfurther investigation that all fungi react in the same degree to the same\r\nreagent, but this conclusion is traversed by Loew and Sawa (1902). These\r\nwriters state that fungi are _not_ stimulated by manganese, and take this\r\nas a proof that the improvement in the growth of phanerogams, induced by\r\nmanganese compounds, is not due to direct stimulation of the protoplasmic\r\nactivity, but to some other more obscure cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MANGANESE STIMULATION.\r\n\r\nThe physiological cause of the stimulation exerted by manganese compounds\r\nhas raised much controversy. Loew and Sawa suggested that the action of\r\nthe sun’s rays upon a normal plant puts a certain check on growth, arising\r\nout of the action of certain noxious compounds which they supposed to be\r\nproduced in the cells under the influence of light. The stimulation of the\r\nmanganese compounds may be due to a supposed increase in the oxidising\r\npowers of the oxidising enzymes, so that destruction of the checking\r\ncompounds can be accomplished as quickly as they are formed, so enabling\r\ngrowth to continue more rapidly.\r\n\r\nAsō (1902) had previously stated that colorimetric tests for oxidising\r\nenzymes indicate that the yellowish leaves from plants treated with\r\nmanganese compounds give reactions of higher intensity than the green\r\nleaves from control plants, the difference between the reactions being\r\nspecially marked in barley, and less so in radish.\r\n\r\nBertrand has devoted much time to the consideration of this and allied\r\nproblems. In 1897 (a, b, c) he proceeded to investigate the essential\r\nnature of manganese in the economy of the plant, his experiments showing\r\nits constant presence in a ferment (laccase) obtained from plants. He\r\nalso extracted from lucerne a substance very poor in manganese, which\r\nwas somewhat inactive, but which regained or increased its activity on\r\nthe addition of manganese. Bertrand stated that manganese was apparently\r\nnot to be replaced by another metal, not even by iron, and that the small\r\nquantity of it occurring was no reason for regarding it as a _secondary_\r\nelement in the composition of plants. The view was also put forward that\r\nin the presence of certain organic substances, such as hydroquinone,\r\npyrogallol or similar bodies, manganese is capable of fixing free oxygen\r\nfrom the air, the volume of oxygen absorbed varying according to the\r\ncompound of manganese used. Bertrand was led to conceive the oxydases\r\nas special combinations of manganese in which the acid radicle, probably\r\nprotein in nature and variable according to the ferment considered, would\r\nhave just the necessary affinity to maintain the metal in solution, i.e.\r\nthe form the most suitable for the part it has to play. The manganese\r\nwould then be, according to his view, the true active element of oxydase,\r\nwhich functions as the “activator”; the albuminous matter, on the other\r\nhand, gives to the ferment those special characters, which show themselves\r\nin their behaviour with regard to reagents and physical agents. From this\r\npoint of view manganese could no longer be considered as a non-essential\r\nelement, but as a substance of vital necessity to the functions of\r\nplant-life. The name “complementary” manure was suggested for compounds of\r\nsuch elements as manganese, which exert a physiological action and which\r\nwere proposed for use as manures. Later (1905) Bertrand considered that\r\nhe had still further proved the indispensable nature of manganese. The\r\nabsence or insufficiency of one essential element arrests or diminishes\r\ngrowth. This applies not only to those substances which are present in the\r\ngreatest abundance, such as C, P, N, &c., but also to those elements like\r\nmanganese, boron, and iodine, which only occur in traces. These elements\r\nare usually specialised in function, and for them the name “catalytic”\r\nelements was suggested, in view of the work they are held to do. As late\r\nas 1910 the rôle of manganese in the functioning of the oxidising enzymes\r\nwas again insisted on. It was concluded that manganese intervenes as a\r\ncatalytic agent in the material changes of which plants are the seat,\r\nand that it participates in an indirect manner in the building up of the\r\ntissues and in the production of organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nManganese exerts a toxic influence upon the higher plants, if it is\r\npresented in high concentration, but, in the absence of great excess\r\nof the manganese compounds, the poisoning effect is overshadowed by a\r\ndefinite stimulation. As is the case with boron, manganese stimulates some\r\nspecies more than others, the action on barley being more evident than\r\nthat on peas. It seems probable that manganese may prove to be an element\r\nessential to the economy of plant life, even though the quantity usually\r\nfound in plants is very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters a very limited number of plant poisons have been\r\nconsidered, yet there is sufficient evidence to show that even these few\r\ndiffer considerably in their action upon plant-life. This action is most\r\nvariable, and it is impossible to foretell the effect of any substance\r\nupon vegetative growth without experiments. The degree of toxicity of the\r\ndifferent poisons is not the same, and also one and the same poison varies\r\nin the intensity and nature of its action on different species of plants.\r\nWhile certain compounds of copper, zinc and arsenic are exceedingly\r\npoisonous, compounds of manganese and boron are far less deleterious,\r\nso that a plant can withstand the presence of far more of the latter\r\nsubstances than of the former. Again, the tested compounds of copper, zinc\r\nand arsenic do not seem to stimulate growth, even when they are applied\r\nin the smallest quantities, whereas very dilute solutions of manganese\r\nand boron compounds decidedly increase growth. But, differentiation occurs\r\neven in this stimulative action, for while manganese is the more effective\r\nin stimulating barley, boric acid is far more potent for peas, the shoots\r\nbeing particularly improved.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the experimental work that has been done on this\r\nsubject of poisoning and stimulation leads one to the inevitable\r\nconclusion that it is not true to maintain the hypothesis that _all_\r\ninorganic plant poisons act as stimulants when they are present in very\r\nsmall quantities, for while some poisons do increase plant growth under\r\nsuch conditions, others fail to do so in any circumstances. It is probable\r\nthat what has been found true with the few substances tested would prove\r\nto be similarly true over a much wider range of poisons, and at any rate\r\nthe hypothesis must be dismissed in its universal application. A more\r\naccurate statement would be that some inorganic poisons act as stimulants\r\nwhen present in small amounts, the stimulating concentrations varying both\r\nwith the poisons used and the plants on which they act.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for a stimulation in one respect to be correlated\r\nwith a retardation in another. In the Rothamsted experiments on the action\r\nof manganese sulphate on barley the weaker concentrations of the salt\r\nimproved the vegetative growth, as was shown by the increase in the dry\r\nweights, but with the same strengths of the poison the ripening of the\r\ngrain was retarded, so that, while certain of the physiological functions\r\nwere expedited, others were hindered by the action of the poison.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that it is exceedingly difficult sharply to\r\ncharacterise either toxic or stimulant action. In neither case is the\r\nreaction simple--many factors may come into play and many processes are\r\nconcerned, while the effect of a so-called poison may vary in respect of\r\neach of the functions and processes concerned. If the poison is presented\r\nin great strength the toxic action is dominant, and probably affects\r\nmany functions in the same sense, so that the action is, so to speak,\r\ncumulative. Lower down in the scale of concentration differentiation of\r\naction may set in, and while some processes may still be hindered, others\r\nmay be stimulated. If the two actions balance one another an apparent\r\nindifference may be manifested, so that it seems that such strengths of\r\nthe poison have no effect on growth, either harmful or beneficial. At\r\nstill lower concentrations, with certain plants and certain poisons, the\r\nstimulative action overpowers the toxic effect, so that in some respect\r\nor other improvement occurs in growth.\r\n\r\nIt is quite conceivable, however, that some poisons are truly indifferent\r\nin weak concentrations, as no stimulation makes itself evident under any\r\ncircumstances. In these cases one is inclined to suspect that the action\r\nis somewhat more simple, in that the toxic effects gradually diminish\r\nuntil no poisonous action is manifest at very weak concentrations, and as\r\nno stimulation is present to bring the growth above the normal with these\r\nvery weak concentrations the plant is similar to those grown without any\r\naddition of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ of these stimulative agents is not yet fully\r\nunderstood. Perhaps at the present time two main theories hold the field:\r\n(1) that they act as catalytic agents, being valueless on their own\r\naccount, but valuable in that they aid in the procuring of essential food\r\nsubstances; (2) that the stimulants themselves are of integral value for\r\nnutrition. The French school, with Bertrand at the head, hold strongly\r\nto the catalytic theory, maintaining that manganese and boron compounds\r\nare able to increase growth if they are present in small quantities, as\r\nthey act as “carriers” whereby the various functions of the plant are\r\nexpedited by the increased facility with which the essential nutritive\r\nelements are supplied. The manganese in laccase, for instance, is held\r\nto be an oxygen carrier, whereby the oxygen is first absorbed and then\r\nreleased for the benefit of the plant, the manganese being regarded as\r\nessential for the functioning of the enzyme. But, if these elements are\r\n_essential_, this theory seems to stop short of the truth. If certain\r\nfunctions are dependent for their very occurrence upon the presence\r\nof even minute traces of any element, then surely that element is as\r\nessentially a nutrient element, as vital to the well-being of the plant as\r\nis such an element as carbon or nitrogen or phosphorus, even though the\r\nlatter occurs in far greater quantity. It is necessary that one should\r\nfree one’s mind from the idea that the quantity of an element present in\r\na plant is an index of its value to the plant. Naturally enough, in the\r\nearly days of plant physiology, the most abundant elements first engaged\r\nthe attention of investigators, and they were divided into essential\r\nand non-essential, ten elements being classed in the former category.\r\nMore recent work is beginning to show that other elements are constantly\r\npresent in plants, but in such small quantities that the older and cruder\r\nmethods of analysis failed to reveal them, so that until lately they have\r\nbeen completely overlooked in work on plant nutrition. Even yet we do\r\nnot know which of these other elements are essential and which are merely\r\naccidental. While we do know that the ten essential elements (C, H, O, N,\r\nS, P, K, Mg, Fe, Ca) are necessary for the well-being of all plants, it\r\nis conceivable that these other substances which only occur in very small\r\nquantities may be more individual in their action, and that while a trace\r\nof a certain element may be absolutely essential to one plant, that same\r\nelement may be quite indifferent for another species. If one takes a broad\r\noutlook, the two theories seem to be in reality only parts of one, the\r\n“nutrition” theory carrying matters a little farther than the “catalytic”\r\nidea, broadening its scope and extending its application.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that all the experimental work that has been\r\ndiscussed will prove to be simply preliminary to a far greater practical\r\napplication of the principle of stimulation or increased growth. While\r\nthe physiologists have been feeling their way towards the conclusions\r\nput forth on this subject, the agriculturists have been discovering and\r\nextending the application of artificial manures, until at the present\r\ntime such manuring is coming into its own and is receiving more of the\r\nwidespread attention that it deserves. The possibility now exists that\r\nin some respects the two lines of work are converging and that the\r\nmore purely scientific line will have a big contribution to make to the\r\nstrictly practical line. Artificial manuring aims at improvement of the\r\nsoil and crop by the addition of food substances that are needed in a\r\nparticular soil, a result that used to be obtainable only by the use of\r\nthe bulky farmyard manure, seaweed, &c. Apart from any other aspect of\r\nthe matter the artificials, when intelligently used, are far more easy\r\nto handle and to regulate in supply, and they yield excellent results,\r\nespecially in conjunction with a certain proportion of organic manures.\r\nThe further prospect now opened up is the possibility of utilising some\r\nof these stimulating compounds as artificial manures. As only small\r\ntraces are beneficial, larger amounts being poisonous, it is obvious\r\nthat only small quantities would be needed, and, as the compounds are not\r\nusually very expensive, a considerable increase of crop for a relatively\r\nsmall outlay might be anticipated if no complicating factors intervened.\r\nVery much work will be required in the field to test the value of these\r\nsubstances, as their action may be influenced by the nature of the soil,\r\nclimatic conditions, general conditions of manuring, and the crops grown.\r\nSome tests have already been made, especially in Japan, with boron and\r\nmanganese, and these indicate a promising field for investigation.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it is most important to realise that one is approaching an\r\nentirely unexplored field, and that it is inevitable that the results of\r\nthe initial experiments will be contradictory, at least in appearance,\r\nso that it is necessary to keep an open mind on the subject, being ready\r\nto modify one’s ideas as circumstances require, as improved experimental\r\nmethods lead on to more accurate results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n_The references are to pages on which authors are mentioned.

RUSSELL,\r\n    D.Sc., Director of the Rothamsted Experimental Station,\r\n    Harpenden, Herts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach volume of this series will contain a summary of the present position\r\non some particular aspect or branch of agricultural science by an expert\r\nof acknowledged authority.\r\n\r\nThe treatment will be critical and impartial, and sufficiently detailed\r\non all points of fundamental importance to be of use alike to all\r\nreaders, but especially to those who are not in touch with an institution\r\npossessing a well equipped reference library. Full references will be\r\ngiven, and a bibliography attached for the benefit of those who wish to\r\nfollow up any particular point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following volumes are in preparation:\r\n\r\n  ~The Strength of Wheat Flour.~ By Professor T.

RUSSELL,\r\n    D.Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volumes of this series are intended to meet the needs of the many\r\nFarm Institutes already in existence or about to be formed. They are\r\nintended for the average student whose object is to farm, rather than\r\nfor the exceptional man who wishes to become an agricultural expert.\r\n\r\nEvery endeavour will be made to attain a high standard educationally, by\r\ntraining students to take an intelligent interest in their daily work\r\nand to appreciate the beauty of the common objects among which their\r\nlife will be passed. On the other hand the fact that farm students must\r\nearn their living on the land will not be lost sight of.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following will be among the first volumes:\r\n\r\n  ~Farm Accounts.~ By C.

The Cambridge University Press has been\r\nfortunate in securing the services of Dr Moss, than whom no one more\r\ncompetent for the task could be found. By a combination as admirable as\r\nit is rare, Dr Moss is at once an acute field botanist, a diligent\r\ninvestigator of herbaria, and a student of botanical literature.... Mr\r\nHunnybun’s drawings are all made from living plants, so that the work\r\nmay be regarded as representing more fully than has been hitherto done\r\nour knowledge of British Botany at the present day.”--_Journal of\r\nBotany._\r\n\r\n  ~Genera of British Plants.~ Arranged according to Engler’s _Syllabus\r\n  Der Pflanzenfamilien_ (Seventh edition 1912), with the addition of the\r\n  Characters of the Genera.
